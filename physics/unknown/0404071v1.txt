Abstract

    KamLAND  (Kamioka  Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector) is a massive liquid-scintillator- 
based neutrino detector studying low energy neutrino oscillation. The experiment has discovered  a 
large  deficit  of  the  reactor  neutrino  flux  with baseline of 180km in the year 2002.   All the solar 
neutrino solutions, except for the Large Mixing Angle solution, are excluded with high confidence 
level.  Assuming the deficit is caused by the oscillation phenomenon of the electron type neutrinos, 
- 5 eV 2 . 
the  most  likely  oscillation  parameters  are  measured  to  be  sin 2 2q = 1  and  D m2 = 6.9 · 10
These  results  are  placing  a  strong  impact  on  the  elementary  particle  physics.  The  KamLAND 
detector makes use of one kiloton of liquid scintillator (LS) as the active neutrino target. This is the 
largest homogeneous LS detector in the world. Although the light yield and attenuation length of the 
LS were measured to be 57% anthracene and ~10m, in the test experiments, when it is used in the 
KamLAND  detector,  the  effective  transparency  and  light  yield  significantly increased from these 
values,  presumably  due  to  the  scattering  and  re-emission  in  the  large  scale  LS.  The  radio active 
- 1 7g/ g for 
contamination in the LS is extremely low, such as 3.5 · 10
- 1 6g / g   for  4 0K.  This  is  the  world's  lowest  contamination  record  so  far

achieved  and  measured.  The success of the KamLAND experiment is a fruit of this high-quality 
and  large-quantity  LS.  In  this  proceedings,  an  outline  of  the  LS  is  described.  A  technical paper 
which describes the LS in detail is now being prepared.

1   Introduction
    The  properties  of  neutrinos  are  least  known  among  the  standard  fermions  due  to  the  extreme 
difficulty  of  its  detection.  However,  the  experimental  studies  of  neutrinos  are  progressing  very 
rapidly in these days thanks to the state-of-the-art neutrino detection technologies. The KamLAND 
experiment has been playing major roll among such experiments since its discovery of the deficit of 
the reactor neutrinos[1]. KamLAND is the neutrino detector which is designed to detect low energy 
neutrinos by using 1kiloton of liquid scintillator.  The main purpose of this experiment is to search 
for  oscillation  phenomena  of  neutrino  by  detecting  reactor  n 
e   which  comes  from  hundreds 
kilometers away. The typical energy of the reactor n 
e  are a few MeV. There are a number of reactors 
at a mean distance of 180km from KamLAND and the expected event rate of n 
e  coming from such 
reactors  is  about  2  per  day  per  kiloton  if  there  is  no neutrino oscillation.  If neutrino oscillation 
exists, the event rate reduces to;

neutrino oscillation exists, it means that at least one neutrino has finite mass and that neutrino states 
mix.  It is possible to access to very low mass scale through neutrino oscillation for which any other 
practical  direct  measurements  can  not  access  to.  The  values  of  the  neutrino  mass  relations  and 
mixing  angles  will  play  an  important  role  when  constructing  the  unified  theory  of  elementary 
particles.

  The  KamLAND  project  was  approved in 1997 and the detector construction was finished in the 
year  2001  and  started  data taking in January 2002. Within the year 2002, the KamLAND group 
found  39%  of  large  deficit  in  the  reactor  neutrino  flux  and  settled down the long standing solar 
neutrino problem [2] with man-made neutrinos for the first time.  Fig.-1 shows the energy spectrum 
of the reactor n 
e  events.  A large deficit in the event rate is clearly seen. Assuming that the deficit is

caused by neutrino oscillation, the most likely oscillation parameters are measured to be sin 2 2q = 1 
- 5 eV 2 .  These  results  were  published  in  December  2002  [1]  and  have  been 
and  D m2 = 6.9 · 10
placing strong impacts on elementary particle physics. Recently KamLAND searched for n 
e  from 
the sun and set the strongest upper limits on the flux [3]. In near future, KamLAND is expected to 
publish the analysis result of  geo-n 
e  [4] detection. The success of such measurements is indebted 
to  the  success  of  the  development  of the high quality and large quantity liquid scintillator for the 
KamLAND detector. 

2.  The KamLAND Detector
    Fig.-2  shows the schematic view of the KamLAND detector. It consists of, from inner to outer, 
1,200m3 liquid scintillator (LS) as active neutrino target, 13m-diameter balloon made of transparent 
Nylon/EVOH(Ethylene Vinyl Alcohol) film to hold the LS, 1,800m3 of buffer oil to cancel the LS 
weight  and  to  shield  g -ray  background,    1,325  17  inch-aperture  PMT  and  554  20  inch PMT to 
measure the scintillation light, 18m-diameter stainless steel tank, and cosmic-ray anti-counter made 
of  3,000m3  pure  water.  The detector locates 1,000m below the top of the Ikenoyama mountain to 
reduce the cosmic rays to 10-5-fold. The PMT photo coverage is 22% for 17 inch PMTs only and 
34% with 20 inch PMTs. The quantum efficiency of the PMTs is about 20% for 340~400nm light.

accidental  backgrounds  are  severely  suppressed.  The  expected  event  rate  is  2/day  for  whole  LS 
volume in case of no neutrino oscillation.  Liquid scintillator was chosen as the active neutrino target

because it is possible to construct large and homogeneous detector, the radio active background level 
is intrinsically very low in petroleum based oils and it is very much cost effective. The light output of 
LS is typically several tens of times of that of Cherenkov light.  Thus it is possible to detector low 
energy signals for which Cherenkov base detector can not reach.  

3.  The Liquid Scintillator
The KamLAND LS was developed by KamLAND RCNS group and there have been a number of 
reports about it [5].  The KamLAND LS consists of 

80v% of normal-Dodecane + 20v% of Pseudocumene+1.52g/liter of PPO,

where, v% stands for % in volume.  Fig.-3 shows molecular structure of these chemicals.

Fig.-3: Chemicals used in the KamLAND LS.

  PPO(2,5-Diphenyloxazole)  is a flour which has been widely used in large scale liquid scintillators 
for high energy physics and neutrino experiments[6].  Fig.-4 shows the emission spectra of  PPO 
and quantum efficiency of KamLAND PMT cathode. The photo cathode of the PMT is a bi-alkali 
type,  which  has  maximum  sensitivity  for  360nm  wavelength  light.  This  figure  shows  that  the 
matching of PPO emission spectrum and high sensitive region of the PMT cathode is good and no 
secondary  wave  shifter  is necessary. PPO is the most 'dirty' material used in the KamLAND LS. 
KamLAND uses PPO which was extra-purified with additional sets of crystalizations by the supply 
company. It is further purified on site by water extraction by KamLAND group. 
    Pseudocumene  (PC)  is  an  aromatic  solvent  whose  chemical  name  is  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene. 
Aromatic  solvents  give  LS  high  light  output  and  neutron/g   and  a
  pulse shape discrimination 
capability.  PC  has  a  high  flash  point  and  low  chemical  reactivity  among  the  BTXC  (Benzene, 
Toluene,  Xylene,  Cumene)  families.  Pure  PC  is  transparent  to  PPO  scintillation  light.  The  PC 
concentration  was  determined  by  optimizing the flash point, light output and transparency for the 
purpose  of  our  experiment.  PC  is  produced  by  fine  distillation  after  the  desulfurization  and 
hydrogenation  of  the  petroleum  oil.  PC is industrially produced and it is possible to obtain large 
amount of high quality PC in a short time period with reasonable price.

Normal-dodecane (ND) does not have double chemical bonding nor circular structure. It means that 
they  have  no  absorption  at  scintillation  for  blue  light  and  is  chemically  stable  and  immune  to 
oxidization.  ND  has  significantly  less reactivity than PC and it is safer for balloon material.  The 
PC+PPO liquid scintillator is diluted with ND to obtain better transparency, higher flash point and 
better stability. Because detector size is large, a very good transparency is essential to obtain high, 
stable and uniform light detection efficiency.  ND has higher flash point (83(cid:176) C) than PC (54(cid:176) C ) 
and adding ND, the safety of the LS improved significantly. ND is produced by refining from the 
petroleum  oil.  Firstly  normal-paraffins  are  selected  from  oils  by  using  molecular  sieves  after 
desulfurization and hydrogenation. Then ND is separated from other normal paraffins by the  fine 
distillations.  The  temperature  window  for  the  distillation  is  very  narrow  and  contamination  is 
generally very low level. The ND is selected among other normal paraffins because it has high flash 
point, yet reasonably high melting point. ND is used in the nuclear industry and a large amount of 
high quality ND is available with reasonable price.  The properties of KamLAND Liquid Scintillator 
are  summarized  in  Table-1.  In  the  table,  'Effective'  means  that  the property includes the effect of 
scattering and re-emission of the scintillation light in the KamLAND detector. This effect could not 
be studied in the small test experiments. 

4.  The Liquid Scintillator R&D
Probably  the  KamLAND  LS  is  one  of  the  most  simple  liquid  scintillators.    It  does  not contain 
secondary wavelength shifter, antioxidant nor any hidden ingredients. It is the result of our strategy 
for the LS development. There is a special difficulty for the KamLAND detector, that is the LS can 
not be replaced once it is filled in the detector because there is no reservoir tanks.  So that we had to 
be  absolutely  confident  that  the  LS  had enough properties before filling in the detector. Also the 
deadline  had been already set when the R&D was started in 1997. Based on these conditions, the 
strategy  of  the  LS  R&D  was  to  use  only  the  proven  technologies  and  to  make  the  scintillator 
components as simple as possible. The aim of the test experiments was to verify the tested property 
satisfies  the  requirement  or  not,  not  to  evaluate  the  quality  in  detail  nor  to  make  thorough 
investigations.  The LS is developed under the following requirements. (1) The energy resolution is 
) to perform the spectrum analysis of the neutrino energy. In order 
to be better than 10% / E MeV
to  achieve  this  resolution,  the  light  output  should  be  larger  than  40%  Anthracene  and  the  light 
attenuation length should be longer than 10m. (2) In order to achieve sufficient signal to noise ratio, 
the  U/Th/K contents should be less than 10-14/10-14/10-12g/g, respectively.  (3) For safety reason, the 

(

flash point should be higher than 60(cid:176) C. (4)  The LS should be stable for several years. (5) Large 
amount of high quality LS ingredients are to be supplied within half year period. And (6) The price 
should be less than a few dollars/liter.  Many sorts of test measurements had been performed before 
the  final  LS  components  were  determined.  Some  examples  of  the  test  items  were,  light  outputs, 
emission  spectra,  absorption  spectra,  transparency  with  optical  photometer,  transparency with 3m 
long tube, radio purities, a
 PSD, stability, aging, compatibility 
with  materials,  6.3m  path  length  direct  light  yield  measurement, 1m3 test bench experiment, flash 
point, possibility of bacteria breeding, efficiency of purification, efficiency of N2 bubbling, etc. It is 
impossible to describe all of them in the limited page of this proceedings and only the direct light 
yield measurements is described below.  The detail of the LS R&D will be reported elsewhere.

       * Preliminary Value
 
 One possible problem of the R&D is that,  in general, the size of the test experiments are very much 
smaller  than  the  actual  KamLAND  detector  and  there  is  ambiguity  when  extrapolating  the 
performance  of  the  test  experiments  to  the  real  detector  size.  So  we  did  the  final  checkout  by 
one-dimensional real size test experiment to make sure that the photoelectron yield is enough after 
passing  through  6.4m  of  LS.    Figs.-5  show  the  measurement apparatus and the measured pulse 
shape.  100-liter  of  LS  was  filled  in  the  6.83m  long  black anodized Aluminum pipe whose inner 
diameter is 14cm. Both ends of the pipe are sealed by 35mm thick UV transparent acrylic plates and

light  was  generated by the cosmic-ray muons which pass across one end of the scintillation pipe. 
Three  plastic  scintillators  sandwiched  the scintillator pipe and triggered the cosmic rays. The lead 
brick between the trigger counters was to select high energy cosmic rays. The PMT at the near end 
with respect to the trigger counters measured the energy deposit of the cosmic rays. 

Fig.-5: Apparatus for direct light yield measurement
and measured timing spectrum.

The PMT at the far end counts the number of photoelectrons and measures the time since the trigger 
signal.  In order to suppress the light reflection from the inner wall of the pipe, there were thin black 
anodized aluminum rings at intervals of 40cm.  The internal diameter of the rings was 11cm and the 
thickness was 2mm. More than 99.99% of reflections in the pipe was suppressed by this structure 
and only the direct lights were detected in the photon counter PMT. The distance between the trigger 
counters  and  the  photon  counter  PMT  was  640cm,  which  corresponds  to  the  radius  of  the 
scintillator balloon of 650cm.  The solid angle of the photon counter PMT viewed from the cosmic 
rays  was  2.3 ·
10-4  sr.  The  typical  energy  deposit  by  cosmic  ray  was  around  15MeV  and  the 
expected number of photoelectrons in the photon counter PMT was 0.1~0.2p.e. /trigger. Therefore 
the direct light yield can be obtained by the photon counting method.  The timing structure of  the 
scintillation  emission  also  can  directly  be  measured  from  the  TDC  distribution.    The  energy 
calibration  was  performed  by  using  the  Compton-scattered  electron  caused by the back scattered 
662KeV  1 3 7Cs  g -ray tagged by a NaI counter behind the source.  The lower figure of the Figs.-5 
shows the timing distribution of the photon counter PMT.   A beautiful pulse shape was observed 
and the decay time of the scintillation was obtained from the tail of the shape to be around 6ns. The 
light  yield  of  the  LS was calculated from the ratio of the number of events in the photon counter 
PMT and the number of cosmic-ray triggers. The light yields were measured by changing the PPO 
concentration.  Fig.-6 shows the result of the measurement. For low PPO concentrations, the light 
output of the LS is small and the photoelectron yield is also small. On the other hand, at too high 

- 7 -

(cid:9)
(cid:9)
(cid:9)
(cid:9)
PPO concentrations, the self absorption and scattering of the scintillation light start to dominate and 
the total photoelectron yield reduces.  

Fig.-6: The Light yield after passing through 6.4m for 

various PPO concentrations.

The  photoelectron  yield  became maximum at 1.5g/liter of PPO, where the expected photoelectron 
yield in the KamLAND detector was calculated to be 200p.e./MeV.  This satisfies the requirement 
of >100p.e./MeV and we became confident this LS can be used in the actual KamLAND detector. 

5. Formulation of the Liquid Scintillator 
  The  LS  formulation  took  place  from  May  2001  to  September  2001.  The  blending  of  LS were 
performed  in  the  oil  purification  system  at  the  site  of  the  KamLAND  experiment  in  the  mine. 
1,800m3  of  ND,  1,000m3  of  isoparaffin  (IP),  240m3  PC  and  1.8tons  of  PPO  are  used  in  the 
KamLAND  detector.   The IP and a part of ND are used for the buffer oil (BO).  PPO had been 
delivered  from  Europe  and  dissolved  in  PC  with  high  concentration  and  purified  with  water 
extraction beforehand.  Five Stainless steel lorry tracks with 12m3  loading capacity carried ND and 
IP  into  the  mine  every day and the oils were unloaded at the KamLAND purification system and 
stored in stainless steel tanks. ND was delivered from a petrochemical complex in Mizushima and 
IP,  from  Yokohama.    The  PC  was  delivered  from  Matsuyama  using  stainless  steel  drum  cans.   
About  230  lorry  deliveries  and  net  1,200  drum  cans  were  needed.    The  pure  PC  and  the 
PPO-concentrate PC were introduced into the purification system using a handy drum pump.  Then 
the liquids in the purification system was self-circulated to blend and formulate the LS and the BO. 
The formed LS and BO were purified and sent to the balloon and the stainless steel tank every day 
after the purification. The filling finished in September 2001 and data taking started from January 
2002 after the installation of electronics. 

6. The Performances of LS in the KamLAND Detector
 Fig.-7 shows an example of event display.  The observed photo-electron yield in the  KamLAND 
detector is approximately 300pe/MeV. This value is much higher than the expectation based on the 
result of the direct light yield measurement. This increase can be explained by the scattering and the 
re-emission  of  the  scintillation  light  in  the  large  scintillator  volume.    The  transparency  is  being 
studied by the dependence of the photo-electron yield on the distance between PMTs and calibration 
sources deployed at known positions. The preliminary value of the effective transparency is roughly 

- 8 -

(cid:9)
(cid:9)
(cid:9)
20m,  where  the 'effective' means that the scattering and re-emission in the LS are contained in the 
measurement. The waveform of each PMT is recorded and the information is converted to the timing 
and charge in the data analysis. The energy is calculated based on the number of photoelectron and 
the position is reconstructed based on the timing.

The  energy  and  position  calibrations  have  been  done  by 
  6 0Co(2.5MeV), 
6 5Zn(1.116MeV)  and  6 8Ge(1.022MeV)  in  the  LS  from  the  chimney  of  the  stainless  steel  tank. 
Neutron  absorption  signals  on  proton  (2.2MeV)  and  1 2C  (4.95MeV)  add  additional  calibration 
points.  Fig.-8 shows the energy distributions for such signals. The energy resolution is measured

clearly seen because the balloon material contains much higher U contents (but still low if compared 
with  regular  materials)  than  LS.  The  high density region at the top and bottom part is due to the 
stainless steel structure of the balloon. The high density region at the vertical center is due to small 
thermometers installed, or 2 2 2Rn introduced when a calibration source is deployed every week. It can 
be  seen  that  the  background  rate  of the LS region is extremely low.  For  4 0K, there is not useful 
coincidence  signals  to  identify  the  source  and  only  upper  limit  was  measured  from  the  energy 
- 1 6g / g .    Fig.-11  shows  the  energy  distribution of the 
distribution  of  the  singles  to  be  < 3.7 · 10
singles. For energies higher than 3 MeV, cosmic-ray spallation back grounds dominates. The 2 0 8Tl 
background  comes  from  the  g -rays  form  PMT  glasses  or  rock  outside  the  detector  and  can  be 
reduced further by setting harder fiducial cut if necessary.  2 1 0Pb is the decay product of the  2 2 2Rn 
which  came  in  the  LS  while  the LS was formulated. These values are low enough for reactor n 
e  
detection.

Summary
The  KamLAND detector uses 1kiloton of high quality LS as the active neutrino target. The LS is 
made  up  by  normal-dodecane,  pseudocumene  and  PPO.    The  total volume of the LS is 1,200m3 
which  is  the  largest  homogeneous  liquid  scintillator  in  the  world.  The  preliminarily  measured 
effective  light  output  is  70%  anthracene  and  the  effective  transparency  is  about  20m.  The  radio 
purity is extremely low, such as  3.5 · 10
e s have been 
detected  with  high  accuracy  and  very  low  background,  and  KamLAND  found  a  large  deficit  of 
reactor  neutrinos  for  the  first  time.  KamLAND  keeps  data taking for several more years and the 
accuracy  of  the  measurement  is  expected  to  significantly  improve  and  other  physics  outputs are 
expected to come out in the future making the full use of this LS.

The physio-chemical properties of Nafion 115 and a composite Nafion 115/Zirconium 
Phosphate (25wt%) membranes are compared.  The composite membrane takes up more 
water than Nafion at the same water activity.  However, the proton conductivity of the 
composite membrane is slightly less than that for Nafion 115.  Small angle X-ray 
scattering shows the hydrophilic phase domains in the composite membrane are spaced 
further apart than in Nafion 115, and the composite membrane shows less restructuring 
with water uptake.  Despite the lower proton conductivity of the composite membranes 
they display better fuel cell performance than Nafion 115 when the fuel cell is operated 
under- humidified.  It is suggested that the composite membrane has a greater rigidity that 
accounts for its improved fuel cell performance.

There has been a push to develop polymer membranes able to operate above 

The most significant barrier to running a polymer electrolyte fuel cell at elevated 

INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Polymer electrolyte fuel cells based upon perfluorinated membranes have 
typically been operated in a temperature range between approximately 50°C and 
90°C.(Blomen and Mugerwa 1993; Srinivasan, Dave et al. 1993; EG&G Services 2000)  
This temperature range is a compromise between competing factors.  Increasing the 
operating temperature above room temperature will improve the electrode kinetics of the 
oxygen reduction reactio n.(Mukerjee and Srinivasan 1993)  The upper limit of 
temperature results from the difficulty in maintaining membrane water content at 
temperatures at or above 100°C.  In addition, temperatures above the polymer glass 
transition temperature (~110°C for protonated Nafion) can cause polymer chain 
rearrangements, which can lead to structural changes in the membrane and lower the 
membrane stability, performance, and lifetime (Yeo and Eisenberg 1977; Hinatsu, 
Mizuhata et al. 1994; Zook and Leddy 1996). 
   
120ºC prompted by the additional benefits of enhanced carbon monoxide (CO) tolerance 
and improved heat removal.(Yang, Costamagna et al. 2001)   
 
temperatures is maintaining the proton conductivity of the membrane.  The increased 
temperature raises the evaporation rate of water from the membrane and the vapor 
pressure required to keep a given amount of water in the membrane; thereby increasing 
the likelihood that  water loss will occur and significantly reduce proton conductivity.  
The conductivity of a dry membrane is several orders of magnitude lower than a fully 
saturated membrane.  A number of alternative strategies have been investigated to 
maintain membrane conductivity in a dehydrating environment (i.e. elevated temperature 
and reduced relative humidity).  
 
improve physical and chemical polymer properties of interest (such as elastic modulus, 
proton conductivity, solvent permeation rate, tensile strength, hydrophilicity, and glass 
transition temperature) while retaining its important polymer properties to enable 
operation in the fuel cell.  A number of investigators have examined composite 
membranes for use in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (Malhotra and Datta 1997; Mauritz 
1998; Antonucci, Arico et al. 1999; Grot and Rajendran 1999; Grot and Rajendran 1999; 
Honma, S.Hirakawa et al. 1999; Alberti, Casciola et al. 2000; Doyle, Choi et al. 2000; 
Lee, Adjemian et al. 2000; Mauritz and Payne 2000; Murphy and Cisar 2000; Miyake, 
Wainright et al. 2001; Adjemian, Lee et al. 2002; Honma, Nishikawa et al. 2002; Si, Lin 
et al. 2002).  The hydration properties of membranes are key characteristics that can 
influence fuel cell performance.  The composite membranes may improve the water-
retention properties of these membranes under low humidity conditions.  We have 
examined composite polymer/inorganic membranes (Nafion/Zirconium phosphate) in 
fuel cells at elevated temperatures.  We have also characterized the physical, chemical 
and electrical properties of these membranes to see how fuel cell performance correlates 
with physical properties.

conductivity when humidified (~10-3

1997; Glipa, Lelout et al. 1997; Alberti, Casciola et al. 1999); (ii) it is a Bronsted acid 
with the ability to donate protons; (iii) it is thermally stability to temperatures above 
180°C; (iv) it is hygroscopic and hydrophilic and (v) it is easily synthesized in a manner 
that is compatible with the chemical and physical  limits of the polymer membrane.(Grot 
and Rajendran 1999)  
The conductivity of perfluorina ted sulfonic acid membranes vary over many 
 
orders of magnitude depending upon important parameters such as the water activity and 
temperature. Models for proton conduction in Nafion have been proposed that provide a 
good semi-quantitative prediction of the conductivity at water activities greater than 
0.2.(Eikerling, Kharkats et al. 1998; Thampan, Malhotra et al. 2000)  However, very little 
has been done to characterize the conductivity of Nafion above 100ºC  or to characterize 
the proton conductivity in composite membranes (Miyake, Wainright et al. 2001).  We 
have compared water uptake, proton conductivity, microstructure morphology and fuel 
cell performance of Nafion and Zirconium Hydrogen Phosphate/Nafion composite 
membranes as functions of temperature (80-140ºC) and water activity.  
 

EXPERIMENTAL 

Membrane Preparation 
 
The composite membranes were prepared using Nafion® 115 films (DuPont) as 
the base material.  To obtain a uniform high purity film, membranes were cleaned with a 
standard treatment procedure: (i) boiling in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 hr to oxidize 
organic impurities; (ii) rinsing with boiling water for several hours;  (iii) boiling in 1 M 
sulfuric acid for 1 hr to remove any metallic/ionic impurities; and (iv) rinsing again in 
boiling water to remove any excess acid.   
 
Zirconium phosphate was incorporated into Nafion using the procedure first 
described by Grot and Rajendran (Grot and Rajendran 1999).  The synthesis was of 
zirconium phosphate involves the reaction of a solution of Zr4+ ions with phosphoric acid 
(H3PO4) leading to the precipitation of the insoluble zirconium phospha te.  In solution the 
procedure produces zirconium hydrogen phosphate, (Zr(HPO4)2) .  To accomplish this 
synthesis within the membrane, the procedure takes advantage of the fact that Nafion and 
other perfluorosulfonic acid ionomers are ion-exchange membranes.  The protons are 
exchanged with zirconium ions and the zirconium ions are subsequently reacted in place 
with phosphoric acid.    
 
First, the membranes were weighed in the dry state, and then swollen in a boiling 
methanol-water solution (1:1 vol) to expand the membrane and facilitate ionic diffusion.  
The membranes were then dipped in a 1M solution of zirconyl chloride, ZrOCl2 (Aldrich) 
for several hours at 80°C.  The ZrOCl2 solution diffuses into the membrane and the 
excess of Zr4+
 ions within the membrane leads to an exchange with sulfonic acid protons 
in the membrane.  The membranes were then rinsed in cold water to remove the zirconyl 
chloride solution from the surface and then immersed in 1 M phosphoric acid (H3PO4) 
overnight at 80°C.  The phosphoric acid has two purposes: (i) it reacts with the Zr4+ ions 
to precipitate insoluble zirconium hydrogen phosphate in-situ, and (ii) the acidic solution 

Nafion/ZP Composite Membranes

can re-protonate the sulfonate anions to regenerate the acidity of the membrane.  The 
membranes were then repeatedly boiled for several hours in distilled water to remove any 
excess acid and ZrOCl2 solution.  After drying, membrane weight and thickness increased 
about 23% and 30% respectively as compared with the unmodified membrane.  Other 
zirconium phosphate concentrations were also obtained (10-12% 20-25% and 36%) by 
varying the zirconyl chloride solution concentration. 
 

Physical/Chemical Characterization 

The composite zirconium phosphate membranes were characterized an electron 

microprobe elemental analysis carried out using a Cameca SX50 experimental 
microprobe.  The cross-sections of several Nafion and composite Nafion/zirconium 
phosphate membranes were analyzed using the electron microprobe to determine the 
presence and distribution of zirconium phosphate by measuring the distribution of 
phosphorus and zirconium.  Micrographs revealed that the control Nafion contains 
negligible traces of these elements, while the composite membranes have a uniformly 
random distribution of zirconium and phosphorus throughout the cross-section. 

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for these membranes were obtained at 

CNR-ITAE using a Philips X-Pert 3710 X-ray Diffractometer using Cu-Ka -source 
operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. 

Ion exchange capacity, IEC, was determined by an exchange of acidic protons 

with another cation in solution (Clearfield and Stynes 1964; Chen and Leddy 2000).  The 
membranes were dried and weighed and then placed in a 1 M NaCl solution at 80°C 
overnight to exchange Na+ ions with H+.  The large excess of Na+ ions ensured virtually 
complete exchange.  The membranes were removed from solution and the solution was 
titrated to the phenolphthalein end point with 0.1 M NaOH solution to determine the 
quantity of exchanged H+ ions.  The ion exchange capacity and equivalent weight (grams 
of polymer per mole of H+) were calculated using the dry weight of the polymer and the 
quantity of exchanged protons. 
 

Water Uptake and Membrane Conductivity 
The water uptake measurements and the conductivity measurements, were carried 
 
out in a barometric sorption vessel that controlled temperature and humidification level.  
The barometric sorption apparatus, shown in Figure 1, is based on a design described by 
Miyake et al. (Miyake, Wainright et al. 2001).

vessel. 
  
 
The sorption vessel volume is 430 mL and is equipped with an Omega pressure 
transducer, copper and thermocouple wire feedthroughs, and swagelok® fittings with a 
septum for water injection.  The unconstrained dry membrane is placed within the 
sorption vessel, which is evacuated at the measurement temperature (80-140°C) for over 
an hour to dry the membrane and remove any residual water from the vessel.  Water is 
injected into the vessel through  the septum using a microliter syringe.

After allowing at least 30 minutes for membrane equilibration with the vapor

This procedure is repeated until no pressure rise is detected with the water injection, 
which indicates the saturation vapor pressure, Psat, is reached.

placed between a set of graphite blocking electrodes spaced 1 cm apart.  The graphite 
electrodes are connected through the wire feedthroughs to measurement equipment.  The 
two probe frequency dependent impedance measurement was carried out on a Princeton 
Applied Research (PAR) Model 398 Electrochemical Impedance System, consisting of a 
potentiostat/galvanostat Model 273A and a lock- in amplifier Model 5210 which are 
connected to a PC running Electrochemical Impedance Software (EIS).  The applied 
signal is a single sine wave of 5 mV with frequencies varying between 105 Hz to 10 Hz.  
Both water uptake and conductivity measurements are made by injecting small quantities 
of water into the sorption vessel and recording the quantity of water injected, the pressure 
in the sorption vessel and membrane resistance.  The water activity was evaluated from 
the actual pressure in the sorption vessel divided by the saturation pressure. 
 

Small Angle X-ray Scattering 

SAXS Sample Preparation 

Nafion membranes and nafion/zirconium phosphate composite membranes were 

used after the cleaning treatment procedure described above.  The thickness of the sample 
was chosen to allow for approximately 40% transmittance.  In some cases, it was 
necessary to use two pieces of membrane to obtain  the optimal thickness.  Before each set 
of runs, the membrane was placed in boiling de-ionized water to ensure full hydration.  
The membrane was then placed in a viton sealed copper sample cell with mica windows.    
The cell was opened and the membrane was slowly dehydrated between runs to allow for 
scattering data collection at different water contents.  Membrane water content, ?, was 
determined gravimetrically.

SAXS Data Collection and Analysis 

The sample cell was placed in the path of the x-ray beam.  Membrane water loss  
during the data collection was minimized by filling the flight tube with helium rather than 
a vacuum. The 1.54 Å Cu-Ka
 x-rays were generated by a Philips XRG-3000 sealed tube 
generator source.  The beam was slit collimated and the scattering was detected by an 
Anton-Paar compact Kratky camera equipped with a Braun OED-50M detector.  Samples 
were typically run at room temperature for 10 minutes.  Background beam scattering, 
sample transmittance, and detector response were corrected for in the data analysis.  The 
data reduction and desmearing procedures are described in detail by Register.(Register 
and Bell 1992) The invariant scattering intensity (q2I) is plotted as a function of scattering 
angle or distance and the Bragg spacing is determined by the location of the peak in 
scattering intensity. 

The water flux through different membranes at 80°C was measured as liquid 

Water Transport  
 
water was fed to the one side of the membrane, and a dry gas was flowed to the opposite 
side.  Nafion 115, Nafion 117 and  Nafion 115/Zirconium phosphate membranes were 
prepared as previously described.  Each of these membranes was hot-pressed at 135°C 
without electrodes, between sealing gaskets for 2 minutes at 10 kN (1 metric ton).   

The membrane was placed in a 5 cm2 fuel cell housing with triple-pass serpentine 

flow fields and heated to 80°C. Liquid water was passed through the flow field on one 
side of the membrane, and a dry N2 stream was passed through the other side.  The water 
vapor in the Nitrogen outlet was condensed in a cold trap at 0ºC and collected in a 
graduated cylinder.  The rate of water flux through the membrane was calculated and 
plotted against the nitrogen flow rate.   

 

 
 

 

Fuel Cell Tests 

Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) Preparation 

Commercial gas-diffusion electrodes (20% Pt-on-carbon, 0.4 mg Pt/cm2, 

purchased from E-TEK) were brushed with 5 wt% solubilized Nafion (Aldrich) to 
impregnate the active layer (0.6 mg/cm2) and then dried at 80°C for 1 h.  The geometrical 
area of the electrodes was 5 cm2.  A membrane was sandwiched between two electrodes 
and gas sealing gaskets, and the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) was then pressed 
for 2 min at 135oC at 20 MPa using a Carver hot press.  

Single Cell Test Fixture and Performance Evaluation 

The MEAs, coupled with gas-sealing gaskets, were placed in a single cell test 

fixture. The H2 and O2 (BOC)  gases were fed to the single cell at 100 sccm.  The gases 
were bubbled through water in temperature-controlled stainless steel bottles to humidify 
the feeds prior to entry to the fuel cell.  The baseline test was total pressure of 1 bar, cell 
temperature of 80°C, and the humidifier bottles at Tanode = 99°C and Tcathode = 88°C 
respectively.  Performance evaluations were carried out at 120-140ºC with a backpressure

in the range of temperatures between 80°C and 140°C, and total pressure of 3 bar 
pressure.  The maximum temperature of the humidifier bottles was 130ºC, corresponding 
to a maximum water vapor pressure of 2.65 bar.  The fuel cell was preconditioned by 
operating at  0.3 V,  and high current density prior to the performance measurement.

and allowing the current and voltage output of the single cell to settle to fixed values (~5-
20 sec).  After the values of current and voltage were recorded, a new load condition was 
used and the single cell output was recorded.  The measurements were made starting at 
open circuit (zero current) and increasing current with each subsequent load condition.  
Because the entire current-potential curve for a given temperature/humidification 
condition is obtained in a few minutes, it is assumed that the membranes have constant 
water content throughout the measurement.   

Pseudo-steady state current-voltage measurements were obtained by connecting 

 

RESULTS 

Physical/Chemical Characterization 

Table 1 compares the density change and ion exchange capacity  for Nafion 115 

and the nafion/ zirconium phosphate composite membrane.  The density of the composite 
membrane is significantly lower than expected based upon the density of Nafion and 
zirconium phosphate (2.1 g/cm3).  The low density of the composite membrane suggests 
it has void volume.  Some residual water associated with zirconium phosphate, which is 
not driven off except at very high temperatures, may also increase the volume of the 
composite membrane.

hydrated membrane and (iii) a thoroughly dried membrane.   The hydrated membrane 
shows only one weak peak circa 2.64 Å, whereas the well-dried membrane shows several

may be attributed to Teflon- like domains of Nafion (5.2 Å and 2.3 Å) (Arico, Creti et al. 
1998), and others that are attributed to the presence of zirconium phosphate phases (4.5, 
3.73, 2.64, 1.7 Å).  Some of the zirconium phosphate peaks match up with typical peaks 
found in alpha zirconium hydrogen phosphate hemihydrate (4.46, 3.54 Å) (Alberti, 
Costantino et al. 1994).  The X-ray patterns are not very sharp, and water uptake by the 
membrane disrupts the crystalline microstructure. It is likely that the membrane swelling 
due to the uptake of water molecules influences the crystalline packing of polymer chains 
as well as the structure of the zirconium phases. 
 
phosphate by using the Debye-Sherrer formula with Warren correction for instrumental 
effects.  In the fully dried membrane the zirconium phosphate particles are estimated to 
be 11 – 1 nm in size.   
 

Diffraction peak width was used to estimate the particle size of the zirconium 

Figure 2.  X-ray diffraction patterns for Nafion 115/Zirconium phosphate (25 wt%) 
composite membranes.  The broad peaks at 2.3 and 5.2Å are attributed to crystalline 
stacking in the Teflon rich microphases.  The sharper features at 1.7, 2.64 and 4.5 Å are 
attributed to ziroconium hydrogen phosphate. 
 
The ion exchange capacity and equivalent weight (grams of polymer per mole of H+) 
were calculated using the dry weight of the polymer and the quantity of exchanged 
protons.  Table 1 shows the results of ion exchange experiment.  The composite 
zirconium phosphate membranes have an increased ion exchange capacity (~40-50%) as 

 

Nafion/ZP Composite Membranes

compared to Nafion.  Zirconium hydrogen phosphates have protons that can be 
exchanged which give the composite membrane a much greater ion exchange capacity. 
 

Water Uptake and Conductivity 
 
Table 2 summarizes the water content of Nafion and Nafion/ZP composite 
membranes equilibrated with 100% relative humidity air at 80ºC and immersed in liquid 
water at 25°C.  Both these conditions correspond to water activity of 1. The membranes 
were removed from the water or the barometric sorption vessel and surface water is 
brushed off to get an accurate membrane water content measurement gravimetrically.  
The water content, l
, is calculated from the mass of water and equations 4 and 5.  Even 
though 100% relative humidity and liquid water both correspond to water activity of one 
there is a difference in the water uptake.  Liquid water uptake is greater than water vapor 
uptake.  This difference has been attributed to the osmotic pressure of the membrane 
swelling in the liquid that can increase water content considerably (Schroeder’s paradox).

The water uptake isotherms at 80ºC for Nafion 115 and the Nafion/ZP composite 

membranes are shown in Figure 3.  As the water activity in the vessel is increased, the 
membrane water content increases.  The isotherm show a rapid rise at low water activity, 
a slow rising plateau at intermediate water activities and the majority of water uptake 
occurring at high water activity aw>0.6. At 80°C and water activity, aw=1, the Nafion 
membrane contains around 11 waters per sulfonate or about 18 wt. % of water. The solid 
line in Figure 3 shows the results of the BET finite layer isotherm model describing the 
membrane water content dependence on relative humidity.   

While the uptake of water from the extruded Nafion membranes has been 
characterized in the literature (Hinatsu, Mizuhata et al. 1994; Futerko and Hsing 1999), 
water uptake by composite membranes has not received much attention.  As seen in 
Figure 3 the composite membrane contains more water than a Nafion membrane at the 
same water activity.  This number of waters is based only on the sulfonic acid content in 
the Nafion and neglects the interaction of water with the Zirconium phosphate.  However, 
even on a total weight basis the Nafion/ZP membrane absorbs more water than Nafion. 
The water uptake was not very sensitive to the temperature over the range of 80-

140ºC.  Our data could not discern any significant difference in the water uptake with 
temperature for fixed water activity.

Figure 3.  Water uptake of Nafion115 and Nafion115/ZP(25wt%) composite membranes

parameters: Nafion 115 (l m=2, c=35, nL=9.2) Nafion/ZP composite  (l m=2.6, c=17, 
nL=12.8) 
 
 
The conductivity of Nafion 115 as a function or water activity over a range of 
temperatures from 80°C to 140°C  is shown in Figure 4.  The data has been plotted on 
both log and linear scales.  Most obvious from the log graph is the significant change in 
conductivity with water activity.  The conductivity increases by five orders of magnitude.  
The conductivity values at aw=0 are probably high because of incomplete water removal 
during the initial evacuation of the barometric sorption vessel can have a large impact.  
Based on the total pressure measurement the water activity is less than 0.002 for low 
conductivity values.  The most reliable conductivity measurements are for intermediate 
water activity, 0.15<aw<0.95 and the conductivity increases by more than two orders of 
magnitude with increasing water activity over that range.  The temperature effect on 
conductivity is much smaller than the effect of water activity.  By plotting the data on a 
linear scale the temperature effect becomes more evident.  There is approximately a 
factor of two increase in conductivity from 80°C to 140°C at fixed water activity. 
 
We expected Nafion/zirconium phosphate membrane s to have an increased 
conductivity compared to unmodified Nafion.  The water content was higher in the 
composite membrane and the zirconium phosphate contributed extra protons to increase 
the charge carrier concentration.  Figure 5 compares the conductivity of the 
Nafion/Zirconium phosphate composite membrane with Nafion 115.  The composite 
membranes had lower proton conductivity than Nafion over the entire range of water

activities and temperatures.    Similar to Nafion 115, the major conductivity change for 
the composite membrane is associated with the water activity.  The conductivity of the 
composite membranes increased with temperature, but the variation of the composite 
membrane conductivity with temperature was slightly less than that observed with Nafion 
115.

SMALL ANGLE X-RAY SCATTERING 
 

The slit collimated scattering data collected by the multi-channel detector was 

The channel detector that corresponds to zero angle was determined, and 

The absolute scattering intensity of the sample was determined by comparing it 

converted into the scattering intensity vs. scattering angle.  The raw data was modified to 
account for several factors: 
(i)  
scattering due to interaction with the Helium sample environment was subtracted.  
(ii)  
quantitatively with a standard polyethylene sample.   
(iii)   The sample was slit collimated in order to increase scattering intensity, by passing 
the beam over a larger sample area.  The data was desmeared using an algorithm from 
Lake. 
(iv)   The invariant scattering intensity (q2I) was plotted as a function of scattering 
angle or distance.  The Bragg spacing is determined by the location of the peak in 
scattering intensity. 

The invariant scattering intensity profile is plotted against scattering angle and the 
resultant peak intensity is correlated to an average Bragg spacing for each membrane 
sample as a function of water content, l
.  Ionomers, such as Nafion, will micro-phase 
separate into a Teflon- like region and an ionic region containing the sulfonic acid 
groups.(Yeo and Eisenberg 1977; Gierke, Munn et al. 1982; Hsu and Gierke 1982; 
Kreuer 2001)  Water partitions into the ionic regions.  Water has a significantly lower 
electron density than the fluorocarbon polymer matrix.  As a result, the electron density 
contrast between the ionic and Teflon- like phases of Nafion increases with increasing 
water content, resulting in greater scattering intensity and an increasingly well-defined 
scattering peak.  At low water contents (l
small and and a distinct scattering peak cannot be observed.(Roche, Pineri et al. 1981)   

 < 4 H2O/SO3H), the electron density contrast is 

In figure 6, the invariant scattering intensity (q2I) is plotted against the Bragg spacing 
for an extruded Nafion 115 and a Nafion 115/ZP composite membrane. The data obtained 
shows that the as the increasing water content leads to an increase in the intensity of the 
scattering peaks.  The scattering intensity increases linearly with water content.  In the 
pure Nafion membranes, the electron density of the ionic inclusions is slightly lower than 
that of the polymer backbone while in the zirconium phosphate composite membrane the 
electron densities of the two phases are almost equal. For this reason there is little 
electron density contrast between the two phases when the membranes are dry and no 
scattering peak is obtained.  As the water content increases, the electron density of the 
ionic inclusions decreases and the intensity of the peaks increases.(Gierke, Munn et al. 
1982)

The scattering peaks for the zirconium phosphate membrane in figure 6B are 

significantly wider than the peaks for the unmodified Nafion 115 membrane, indicating 
greater structural heterogeneity.  In addition, the maximum scattering intensities are 
reduced as compared to unmodified Nafion 115.  The maximum spacing between ionic 
inclusions at the highest water content is nearly the same for the Nafion 115 and the 
Nafion 115/ZP composite.  However, the shift in the spacing with water content is much 
less for the composite membrane than for Nafion 115. 

 

Water Transport 

The flux of water through the membranes as a function of the nitrogen flow through 

the test cell is shown in Figure 7.  The Nafion 117 membrane has almost the same 
thickness as the Nafion 115/ZP composite membrane, permitting us to distinguish 
between the effects of membrane thickness and membrane composition.  The data in 
Figure 7 show the water flux increases with nitrogen flow rate through the test cell at low 
flow rates and then plateaus at a limiting flux. The limiting flux corresponds to the 
minimum mass transfer resistance at the membrane gas interface, and diffusion through 
the membrane is the dominant mass transfer resistance. The limiting flux is greatest for 
the Nafion 115 membrane.  The flux was reduced through the Nafion 117 membrane due 
to increased membrane thickness.  The limiting water flux through the composite 
membrane is less than that for Nafion 117 suggesting that water diffusion through the 
composite membrane is reduced relative to diffusion through Nafion.

Fuel Cell Performance of Nafion/Zirconium Phosphate Composite 
Membranes 

Polarization curves for fuel cells with membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) 

containing Nafion 115 and Nafion 115/Zirconium Phosphate membranes were measured 
at four different sets of operating conditions.  The base case was for humidified feeds 
near water activity of one with a cell temperature of 80ºC.  The other three conditions 
were at elevated temperature and a total pressure of 3 bar.  The conditions tested were: 
 

Operating Conditions: 

1 – P=1 bar, Tanode/Tcell/Tcathode=90/80/88 
2 – P=3 bar, Tanode/Tcell/Tcathode=130/120/130 
3 – P=3 bar, Tanode/Tcell/Tcathode=130/130/130 
4 – P=3 bar, Tanode/Tcell/Tcathode=130/140/130 

 
 Polarization curves are shown in Figure 8 for fuel cells with Nafion 115 and 
Nafion 115/Zirconium Phosphate membranes at conditions 1 and 3.  At 80ºC the fuel cell 
performance was nearly identical for both membranes, with the effective MEA resistance 
being slightly greater for the composite membrane than Nafion 115.  When the 
temperature was 130ºC the MEA resistance was substantially less for the composite 
membrane than for the Nafion 115 membrane.

In Figure 9 we show the polarization curves for fuel cells with Nafion 115 and 

Nafion 115/Zirconium Phosphate Composite membranes at different levels of 
humidification.  The temperature designation Tanode/Tcell/Tcathode corresponds to the 
temperatures of the humidification bottles for the anode and cathode and the fuel cell 
temperature.  By maintaining the humidification temperatures fixed the water vapor 
pressure of the feeds are fixed.  As the cell temperature is increased the water activity in 
the cell is decreased, aw=Pw/Psat(Tcell).  The effective MEA resistance increased less with 
decreased water activity for the composite membrane than observed with the Nafio n 115 
membrane.

The composite membranes appeared to operate more stably at elevated 
 
temperatures.  The cell was operated at 130°C for 1h, and then the cell temperature was 
raised to 140°C.  After one hour of stable operation under the latter condition, the cell 
temperature was returned to 130°C.  After this procedure with the composite membrane 
the current voltage curves returned to their initial (pre-140°C operation) values.  The 
unmodified membranes, by contrast, were altered by the brief exposure (~20 to 30 
minutes) to the high temperature.  The effective ohmic resistance of the MEA increased 
from 1.3 O to over 2 O after operation at 140ºC.    
 

When we initiated our studies with composite membranes the hypothesis was that 

DISCUSSION 
 
 
addition of Zirconium phosphate to Nafion would increase the water uptake by the 
membrane at elevated temperatures.  Increasing water content was expected to increase 
the proton conduction  thus improving the membrane performance in the fuel cell.  We 
were surprised that the proton conductivity was diminished in the composite membrane 
relative to Nafion in spite of the increased water uptake; and we were even more 
surprised that the fuel cell performance of the composite membranes exceeded Nafion 
even though the proton conductivity was reduced.  Our data does not provide a definite

18 

resolution to these conflicting experimental observations, but the data does suggest that 
mechanical properties of the composite membranes may be the key to the performance of 
composite membranes. 
 

Water Uptake and Ion Exchange Capacity 
 
The ion exchange capacity of the composite membrane is greater than the ion 
 
exchange capacity than Nafion.(Alberti, Casciola et al. 1999; Alberti, Casciola et al. 
1999)  Zirconium phosphate has exchangable protons, the number of protons depends on 
the chemical form of the zirconium phosphate.  The ion exchange capacity (IEC) for the 
composite membrane listed in Table 1 can be divided into contributions from the Nafion 
and from the Zirconium Phosphate.

Assuming the IEC of nafion in the composite is unchanged the IEC for the Zirconium 
Phosphate in the membrane is 2670 m eq/g.  Zr(HPO4)2 and Zr2(PO4)2(HPO4) are well 
known forms of Zirconium phosphate with ion exchange capacities of 7170 and 2140 
m eq/g respectively.  The ion exchange capacity of the included zirconium phosphate  in 
the composite membrane is intermediate to these forms of zirconium phosphate;  it is 
easy to imagine a mixture of different zirconium phosphate phases are formed in the 
composite membrane.  XRD  identified diffraction peaks that correspond to crystalline 
zirconium hydrogen phosphate, but most of the zirconium phosphate was amorphous and 
XRD cannot quantity and forms of  the amorphous zirconium phosphate. 
Liquid water uptake by Nafion 115 and the Nafion115/ZP composite were the 
 
same when normalized by the sulfonic acid concentration.  The mass uptake of  liquid 
water normalized by the mass fraction of nafion in the membrane is the same in both 
membranes.  

 Water uptake from the vapor is reduced compared to water uptake from liquid 
water.  The composite membranes showed substantially greater water uptake from the 
vapor phase than water uptake by Nafion 115.  The water uptake as a function of water 
activity, shown in Figure 3, was fit by a finite layer BET isotherm. (Thampan, Malhotra et 
al. 2000)

l m is the monolayer coverage of water on the sulfonic acid groups, c is related to the 
chemical potential change due to water adsorption, and nL is the number of layers that 
can be adsorbed.  The data fits suggest that the more water can be adsorbed in the 
composite both in the monolayer (first salvation shell –larger l m) and in the multilayer 
(larger nL); however, the reduction of c for the composite membrane suggests the water is 
less strongly adsorbed in the composite membrane.

Why should the composite membrane absorb more water from the vapor phase?  
 
SAXS data in Figure 6 show the distance between the ionic inclusions in the composite 
membrane change less than Nafion 115 with increased water content.  The scattering 
peak shifts from  4.5 to 5.1 nm in the composite membrane, and from 3.7 to 5.1 nm with 
in Nafion 115.  The zirconium phosphate is formed when the membrane is fully hydrated, 
and the distance between the hydrophilic inclusions in at ~5.1 nm.  When the membrane 
is dried, the Nafion contracts but the zirconium phosphate does not.  The zirconium 
phosphate appears to act as scaffold so the membrane cannot shrink much when the water 
is removed.  During rehydration the composite membrane does not swell much because 
the inorganic scaffold has kept it extended. 
 
The scaffolding effect of the membrane also explains why the water vapor uptake 
by the composite membrane is greater.  When the Nafion 115 membrane absorbs water it 
must do work to swell the membrane, the composite membrane is already in a partially 
swelled state, so less work has to be done to swell the membrane, resulting in greater 
water uptake.  The scaffolding effect also explains the reduced density of the dry 
composite membrane relative to both Nafion and zirconium phosphate.  The scaffold ing 
maintains the dimension of the membrane from the swollen state, so as the water is 
removed void volume is created. 
 

Proton Conductivity 
The  water  content  and  proton  conductivity  of  Nafion  membranes  has  been  studied 
 
extensively.    The  equilibrium  water  content  increases  monotonically  with  increasing 
water activity of the surrounding phase.  Water absorbed in the membrane dissociates the 
sulfonic acid groups liberating protons that can carry a current.  Free protons rarely exist 
alone  in  aqueous  solution  and  are  almost  always  bound  to  one  or  more  waters  as 
hydronium  ions;  however,  we  will  refer  to  the  mobile  ions  in  the  membrane  as  protons 
and  their  motion  as  proton  conductivity.    The  conductivity  depends  strongly  on  the 
concentration and mobility of the  resulting protons.  Protons are transported through the 
membrane by two pathways.  The first is a proton shuttling (or Grotthus) mechanism that 
involves  the  formation  and  breaking  of  hydrogen  bonds  between  the  proton  and  water.   
Rotation of the water molecules and hydronium ions is required so that the molecules are 
correctly  aligned  and  new  hydrogen  bonds  can  be  formed  (Bockris  and  Reddy  1998; 
Marx, Tuckerman et al. 1999).  The second pathway for proton conduction is equivalent 
to traditional cation conduction where the hydrated proton diffuses through the aqueous 
media  in  response  to  an  electrochemical  gradient  (Zawodzinski,  Davey  et  al.  1995; 
Eikerling, Kornyshev et al. 1997).  The proton conductivity via the Grotthus mechanism 
is  considerably  faster 
that 
approximately 90% of proton conductance occurs via the Grotthus pathway  (Bockris and 
Reddy 1998). 
Proton  conductivity  depends  on  the  proton  concentration,  proton  mobility,  and  the 
 
conduction path.  We fit our proton conductivity data to two models form the literature in 
an  effort  to  identify  the  role  of  the  zirconium  phosphate  in  proton  conductivity.   One 
model was primarily based on physical properties and a second model based on physical 
chemistry.    The random network model for membrane proton conductivity proposed by 
Eikerling  et  al.  (Eikerling,  Kharkats  et  al.  1998)  is  based  upon  the  inverted  micelle

structure of Nafion and other ionomer membranes.  In this model, the inverted micelles, 
or ionic clusters, are called “pores”, and channels connect the random network of these 
pores  distributed  throughout  the  membrane.    There  are  two  types  of  pores  described  in 
this  model.    Wet  pores  have  high  water  content  and  consequently  they  have  high 
conductivity.    Dry  pores  have  minimal  water,  and  lower  conductivity.    As  a  membrane 
absorbs water and swells, the fraction of  wet pores in the membrane increases, while the 
fraction of  dry pores decreases.  With a higher percentage of wet pores the average pore 
conductivity  and  the  overall  bulk  membrane  conductivity  both  increase.    This  model 
makes  use  of  small  angle  x-ray  scattering  (SAXS)  data  and  the  cluster  swelling  model 
described  by  Gierke  et  al.  to  account  for  membrane  swelling  and cluster  reorganization 
with  increased  water  content.  (Gierke,  Munn  et  al.  1982;  Hsu  and  Gierke  1982)    A 
random  network  of  wet  and  dry  pores  exists  in  the  membrane,  whose  distributions  are 
governed by the membrane water content and swelling behavior.   
 
The Eikerling model uses a single-bond effective medium approximation (SB-EMA) 
to  solve  for  the  conductivity  of  this  random  network.    Swelling  and  structural  changes 
(i.e.  ionic  cluster  reorganization)  that  occur  within  the  membrane  with  increasing  water 
content and are described in the following equations: 
n(w) = n0(1+ aw) 
)3 
(
u w( ) = u 0 1+ bw
where n(w) is the number of sulfonic acid groups in an average pore,  n0 is the number of 
sulfonic acid groups in the average pore of a dry membrane,  u(w) is  the average volume 
of  the  pore,  u0  is  the  pore  volume  in  the  dry  membrane,  w  is  the  water  content  of  the 
membrane  in weight percent, and the parameters  a and b are used to describe the extent 
of the swelling and reorganization in the membrane.  An increase in parameters  a
 
reflect an increased extent of membrane reorganization.  The fraction of wet pores, x(w), 
depends on the water fraction, the swelling parameters and a scaling parameter, g .

The  small  angle  x-ray  scattering  (SAXS)  data  and  the  cluster  swelling  model 
proposed  by  Gierke  and  Hsu  (Gierke  and  Hsu  1982)  were  employed  to  calculate  the 
values for the number of sulfonates per pore and the pore volume (n and u) as a function 
of water content, w.  The calculated values of n and u were plotted as a function of w and 
 and  b  were  calculated.    The parameter  g  was obtained by 
the  best  fit  for parameters  a
equating  x(w)=1  when  w=0.41  in  equation  10.    Table  4  shows  the  parameter  values 
obtained  from  the  SAXS  data  and  conductivity  at  saturation.  A  critical  caveat  in 
determining  these  swelling  parameters  is  that  the  SAXS  data  was  collected  at  room 
temperature  (25°C),  while  it  is  being  applied  to  the  membrane  conductivity  model  at 
80°C.

The  model  fit  to  the  experimental  conduc tivity  data  is  shown  in  Figure  10.    The 
model consistently overestimates the conductivity.  The values of the swelling parameters 
 are less for the composite membrane than those obtained for Nafion 115,  which 
reflect the decreased swelling of the composite membrane.  The conductivity of the dry 
pores  is  nearly  an  order  of  magnitude  greater  for  the  composite  membrane  than  for 
Nafion 115.  This may be important for fuel cell operation at reduced water activity.

Thampan  et  al.  presented  an  alternative  model  for  proton  conductivity 
ionmers.(Thampan,  Malhotra  et  al.  2000)    This  model  is  based  upon  the  similarities 
between  proton  diffusion  in  an  aqueous  electrolyte  and  in  the  membrane  electrolyte.   
Their  model  introduces  corrections  to  proton  diffusion  in  water  to  account  for  the 
presence of the polymer matrix: 

(i) 

The additional frictional interaction with the polymer membrane is modeled as 
proton diffusion through both water and large polymer particles.

The  introduction  of  a  percolation  threshold  below  which  no  conduction  can 
take place because of the lack of a continuous conduction pathway. 

Effective  diffusion  constants  are  introduced  to  account  for  the  porosity  and 
tortuosity of the of polymer matrix.   

The  model  yields  the  following  equations  that  describe  the  conductivity  of  a  proton

where  e
  is  the  fractional  membrane  volume  filled  with  water  and  e 0  is  the  fractional 
membrane volume corresponding to the percolation threshold,  q is a fitted constant,  cHA,0 
is  the  concentration  of  sulfonic  acid  groups,  d
  is  the  ratio  of  diffusion  coefficients 
(DH+,H2O and  DH+,Membrane), and  l 1
0  is  the  equivalent  conductance  at  infinite  dilution  in 
water.  a
 is the fractional dissociation of the sulfonic acid in the membrane, which is a 
function of water content.  
  One of the most crucial elements of this model is the variation of the proton diffusion 
coefficients with water content.  The theoretical relationship between water content and 
membrane  proton  diffusion  coefficients  has  not  been  adequately  delineated  in  the 
literature, although some attempts have been made on an empirical basis (van der Stegen, 
van der Veen et al. 1999).   Thampan  used d
 as a fitting parameter to improve the model 
fit to literature conductivity data. 
The  major  controls  on  the  membrane  conductivity  with  water  content  in  this  model 
 
are (i) d
, the proton concentration, (iii) e 0, 
the  percolation  threshold  and  (iv)  q,  a  fitted  parameter  which  controls  the  percolation 
behavior.  In our analysis we used the values suggested by Thampan et al. listed in Table 
5.   The only parameter that  we modified between the various membranes is  d
.  Figures 
10A and 10B show the model results  compared with experimental conductivity vs. water 
content data.

The  model  does  a  fair  job  at  reproducing  the  experimental  data.    As  the  membrane 
 
water content increases the sulfonic acid residues dissociate increasing the concentration 
of  protons  in  the  membrane  and  increasing the conductivity.   The predicted conductivity

decreases faster with decreased water content than the experimental data.  The composite 
membranes  have significantly increased  d
 values compared to unmodified Nafion.  The 
determination of the best fit  d
 values suggest that there is a factor of 2-3 decrease in the 
diffusion  coefficient  for  protons  through  the  “polymer”  portion  of  the  composite 
membrane at   given  water  content.  This decrease is much more than the decrease in the 
water  diffusion  suggested  by  the  water  transport  experiments.    The  water  transport 
through  the  composite  membrane  is  35%  less  than  water  transport  through  the  Nafion 
117  membrane.    If water diffusion  is  limited  to  the  organic  phase  of  the  composite  the 
water  transport  data  suggest  the  zirconium  phosphate  plays  no  role  in  water  diffusion. 
The discrepancy between the water transport data and the model fit for proton conduction 
suggests that our assumptions of model parameters may not be correct.    

  Membrane structure is a key membrane  characteristic and consequently, a necessary 
component in a detailed proton conduction model.  The model  by Thampan et al. could 
be  improved  if  the  relationship  of  d
  and  the  membrane  structural  characteristics  were 
more explicitly determined.  
The  Thampan  model  as  well  as  the  models of Gieke  and Paddison  (Paddison  2001) 
 
assume  a 
threshold  water  content  below  which  no  proton  conduction  occurs.  
Experimentally Nafion membranes have a small but non-zero conductivity even at “zero” 
water  content.    The  model  presented  by  Thampan  et  al.  neglects  tunneling  and  other 
diffusion mechanisms that may dominate at low water content.   
  We have shown a single parameter empirical fit to the conductivity data for Nafion in 
Figure 4A.

aw=0 is the conductivity of a dry membrane, c1=ln(s

parameter.    This empirical fit gives a direct evaluation of the proton conductivity based 
on  the  thermodynamic  water  activity  of  the  surrounding  vapor  phase.    This  empirical 
equation  fits  the  conductivity  data  very  well  with only one  adjustable  parameter.    The 
empirical  fit  is  useful  for  modeling  PEM  fuel  cells  where  it  directly  relates  the 
conductivity to the observable variable, water activity.

Fuel Cell Performance 
The most surprising result from our studies is that fuel cell performance, as 
 
judged by the polarization curves, is improved for composite membranes even though the 
conductivity is poorer.  This improvement in fuel cell performance appears to be limited 
to conditions where the water activity is significantly less than one.  We estimated the 
water activity in the fuel cell for different temperatures of the humidifier bottles assuming 
the same mass transfer efficiency at the different temperatures.  The estimated water 
vapor pressure of the gases humidified at 140º, 130º and 120ºC are 2.4,  2.0 and 1.7 bar 
respectively, so the water activity in the fuel cell for the three cases are 
aw(140/130/140)=1.0, aw(130/130/130)=0.85 and aw(120/130/120)=0.70.   
 
Reducing the water activity from 1.0 to 0.7 should increase the membrane 
resistance for Nafion 115 from 0.20 O-cm2 to 0.22 O-cm2.  However, from the fuel cell 

s

data the membrane resistance increased from 0.24 O-cm2 to 9.8 O-cm2.  The increase in 
the effective MEA resistance is much greater than predicted from the conductivity 
measurements.  Why is there such a large discrepancy and why does the effective MEA 
resistance only increase from 0.27 to 0.79 O-cm2 for the composite membrane? 
We suggest that the discrepancy is due to the constrained environment of the 
 
membrane in the fuel cell.  The MEA is compressed between the bipolar plates.  The 
applied pressure on the MEA limits the swelling of the membrane.  Absorbed water 
swells the membrane creating a “swelling pressure” that must overcome the applied 
sealing pressure of the fuel cell.  The greater the water activity the greater the swelling 
pressure exerted by the membrane.  In the fuel cell environment the water content of the 
membrane is probably much less than expected based on ex-situ measurements because 
the sealing pressure squeezes water from the membrane. 
 
internal scaffolding, which would resist compression of the sealing pressure.  At the 
reduced water activity the composite membrane can take up water and swell without 
having to overcome the applied sealing pressure.  We suggest that the zirconium 
phosphate provides mechanical strength to the membrane, and it plays little role in the 
actual conduction of protons through the membrane.  This explanation is also consistent 
with our group’s results with other Nafion/metal oxide composite membranes.  We have 
routinely found improved fuel cell performance of the composite membranes at reduced 
water activity, and there has been little sensitivity to the choice of metal oxide.(Adjemian, 
Lee et al. 2002; Ad jemian, Srinivasan et al. 2002; Costamagna, Yang et al. 2002) 
 

We suggested the zirconium phosphate in the composite membrane forms a rigid 

CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
Nafion 115/ Zirconium Phosphate composite membranes show enhanced fuel cell 
performance compared to Nafion 115 at elevated temperature and reduced water activity.  
A Nafion 115/Zirconium Phosphate composite membrane had a greater ion exchange 
capacity and took up more water than Nafion 115 membranes, but the composite 
membranes showed reduced proton conductivity and water transport.  Small angle X-ray 
scattering data indicated the spacing between hydrophilic phases in the composite 
membrane were further apart than in Nafion 115, and there appeared to be less 
restructuring of the composite membrane with water absorption.  The data suggest that 
the Zirconium Phosphate forms an internal rigid scaffold within the membrane that 
permits increased water uptake by the membrane in the confined environment of the fuel 
cell Membrane Electrode Assembly.

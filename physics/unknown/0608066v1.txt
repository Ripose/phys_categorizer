ABSTRACT    We  study  second  harmonic  generation in a  negative index  material cavity. The 

transmission  spectrum  shows  a  gap  between  the  electric  and  magnetic  plasma  frequencies,  so 

that  localized  and  anti-localized  states  are  allowed  at  the  band  edges.  The  process  is  made 

efficient  by  local  phase  matching  conditions  between  a  forward-propagating  pump  and  a 

backward-propagating  second  harmonic  signal.    By  simultaneously  exciting  the  cavity  with 

counter-propagating pulses one is able to enhance or inhibit absorption and stimulated processes. 

The  control  parameter  is  the  relative  phase  difference  between  the  two  incident  pulses  which 

determines the interference properties of the fields inside the cavity.

After the first theoretical studies on negative-index materials (NIMs)1, also referred to as 

left-handed  materials  (LHMs),  the  surprising  properties  of  this  class  of  meta-materials2  have 

been  proposed  by  Pendry3  in  a  thin  metal  layer  acting  as  a  perfect  lens.  Subsequently,  this 

encouraging  result  has  been  experimentally  observed  in  metal  slabs4,  as  well  as  in  composite 

structures  made  by  loops  (or  split-ring  resonators)  and  wires.5,6  Negative  refraction,  negative 

phase velocity, and the super-lens effect are remarkable examples of linear phenomena due to a 

negative  refractive  index.  The  inclusion  of  nonlinear  elements  within  meta-materials,  for 

instance  by  adding  diodes  in  the  split-ring  resonators'  paths,  can  induce  cubic  or  quadratic7,8 

nonlinear responses.  Therefore, classical nonlinear processes may be reviewed by exploiting the 

unusual,  and  sometimes  counterintuitive,  properties  of  NIMs.  In  earlier  works,  Agranovich  et 

al.9, and Shadrivov et al.10 analyzed second harmonic generation (SHG) at an interface between a 

positive index  material (PIM) and a second-order, nonlinear, loss-less NIM.  In both papers, it 

was found that a forward-propagating pump wave tuned in the spectral region where the index of 

refraction  is  negative  can  be  phase-matched  to  a  backward-generated  second  harmonic  signal 

tuned in the positive index region (by forward- or backward-propagation we mean the direction 

of  energy  and  momentum  flow).  Efficient  SHG  has  been  also  reported  by  Scalora  et  al.11  in 

reflection  from  an  interface  between  air  and  a  matched  NIM.  In  this  case,  even  though  the 

absorption 

length  was 

just  a  few  wavelengths, 

the 

local  phase-matching  condition

 provided by the meta-material still ensured significant conversion efficiencies 

in a process that evolved near the air-NIM interface. 

In  this  Letter  we  study  nonlinear  pulse  propagation  effects  and  SHG  in  a  quadratic, 

nonlinear slab of NIM. 

By engineering the size of split-ring resonators and wires, one is in 

principle  able  to  design  the  electric  and  magnetic  plasma  frequencies  at  the  desired  spectral

( )
ε ω   and  permeability 

μ ω   are 

( )

simultaneously  positive  or  negative,  the  material  allows  light  propagation,  with  corresponding 

positive  or  negative  phase-velocity.  On  the  other  hand,    light  cannot  propagate  through  the 

material within the frequency range where  ( )

ε ω  and 

( )

μ ω have opposite signs, as the NIM has 

metallic properties. We consider the Drude model for both  ( )

ε ω  and 

μ ω  to take into account

where  ε∞ and  μ∞ are  the  permittivity  and  permeability  at  high  frequencies,  ωe and  ωm are  the 

electric and magnetic plasma frequencies,  γe and  γm are the damping factors, which are related 

to the extinction coefficient of the medium. For simplicity, the cavity we analyze is surrounded 

by air; moreover, the electric and magnetic plasma frequencies do not coincide, so that  ω

m< ,  
ωe

and the medium is not matched to the surrounding air. With these parameters, an intrinsic gap is 

created  between  these  two  frequencies,  so  that  the  material  displays  NIM  behavior  for ω ωe< , 

and  a  positive  index  response  for  ω ωm>

.  As  pointed  out  by  D’Aguanno  et  al.12,13  ,  such  a 

structure localizes the electric field of a wave tuned at the lower band edge, and anti-localizes the 

electric  field  of  a  signal  tuned  at  the  upper  band  edge.  As  a  result,  significant  lowering  of  the 

group velocity and large enhancement of the density of modes can be achieved at the band edge 

using  a  NIM  slab  just  a  few  wavelengths  thick.  This  behavior  reveals  that  such  a  NIM  cavity

reproduces mechanisms analogous to band edge effects displayed by a one-dimensional photonic 

crystal, and so it is suitable to enhance nonlinear processes.  

 

In  the  paper  by  Centini  et  al.14,  the  dynamics  of  counter-propagating  pulses  through  a 

one-dimensional photonic crystal was analyzed, and it was shown that SHG efficiency may be 

enhanced or suppressed by changing the relative phase difference between the coherent, incident 

pulses. This effect is due to the phase-dependent interference mechanism that occurs between the 

two  pulses  tuned  at  the  band  edge,  leading  to  dynamic  and  coherent  control  of  the  effective 

density of modes that regulates stimulated processes. In this paper we thus analyze pulsed SHG 

in a NIM cavity and exploit the local phase-matching conditions that exist inside the cavity. We 

also  demonstrate  the  modulation  of  SHG  efficiency  by  using  coherent,  counter-propagating 

pulses.  Furthermore,  we  observe  that  the  inhibition  of  SHG  efficiency  is  accompanied  by  a 

drastic reduction of absorption losses in the cavity. 

 

We solve Maxwell’s equations in the time domain using two different techniques: (i) the 

finite  difference  time  domain  (FDTD)  scheme  described  by  Ziolkowsky  and  Heyman15, 

supplemented by the introduction of nonlinear magnetic and electric polarization terms; and (ii) 

the  method  described  in  ref.  11  by  Scalora  et  al.,  which  utilizes  a  fast  Fourier  transform  pulse 

propagation  algorithm.    While  both  give  nearly  identical  results,  here  we  describe  the  FDTD 

approach. The following equations are relative to the propagation of pulses along the z direction:

step is dt=0.9dz in order to insure the stability of the method. Second-order, analytical  absorbing 

boundary conditions are adopted at the edges of the simulation grid.16 The width of the cavity is

.  The  linear  transmission  and  the  refractive  index  (real  and

(cid:4)
F=
edge at  ω ω

(cid:4)

=

, close to the electric plasma frequency, so that an exceptionally high 

localization of the electric field and an anti-localization of the magnetic field occur. The Q-factor 

of the cavity, measured at the lower band edge resonance, is about 400. In contrast, waves tuned 

to the transmission resonances in the neighborhood of the magnetic plasma frequency display the 

opposite picture, i.e. a strong magnetic field localization and an anti-localization of the electric 

field. The structure is designed in a way that the second harmonic signal is tuned to the second 

resonance above the high-frequency band edge, so that the anti-localization of the electric field 

5

 

 

 

does  not  negatively  affect  the  second  harmonic  (SH)  conversion  efficiency.  Moreover,  the 

particular  phase-matching  condition

n= −

  achieved  at  ω

  implies  that 

the  forward-propagating  signal  at  the  fundamental  frequency,  which  experiences  negative 

refraction,  is  phase-matched  to  the  backward-propagating  signal  at  the  second  harmonic 

frequency,  as  described  in  ref.  11.  Even  with  a  relatively  small  damping  coefficient,  the  high 

cavity-Q causes linear absorption losses to reach  nearly 20% at the band edge.  

 

In  Fig.  2  we  show  the  SHG  efficiency  as  a  function  of  pump  pulse  duration.  Using  

nonlinear  coefficients  of

  and

  for  the  pump  pulse,  we  observe  a  maximum  conversion  efficiency  of 

2

approximately 7% for pulses long enough to be completely coupled with the narrow, band edge 

resonance at  ω 0.522

=(cid:4)

. The conversion efficiency is calculated by considering the total amount 

of  SH  radiated  energy,  that  in  this  case  is  nearly  equally  divided  between  the  forward  and 

backward directions.  

 

The use of coherent, counter-propagating pulses, as described in ref. 14, can increase or 

decrease the effective transit time through the cavity, so that one is able to coherently control the 

effective  group  velocity  and  the  interaction  time  between  the  electromagnetic  field  and  the 

structure.  In  Fig.  3  we  plot  the  delay  (or  transit)  time,  i.e.  the  time  needed  by  the  peak  of  the 

pulse to traverse the entire cavity, as a function of the relative phase difference  φΔ between two 

coherent, counter-propagating pulses impinging onto the NIM with the same peak power, both 

tuned  to  the  band  edge  resonance.  The  interference  between  the  pulses  in  the  structure  is 

constructive when  φ

Δ = , and the delay of both left and right radiated pulses is maximized to 

0

approximately  double  the  delay  accumulated  by  a  single  pulse.  Under  these  operational 

 

6

conditions, the localization of the electric field is maximized, and the effective group velocity is 

reduced. Now, if  φ

Δ =

180

° , the two pulses emerging from the cavity undergo a delay that is 

almost  one  order  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  maximum  delay  value,  and  the  total 

electromagnetic field becomes anti-localized.  

 

Finally, we analyze the nonlinear interaction under counter-propagating pulses regime; in 

this  excitation  scheme,  each  pulse  carries  a  peak  power  equal  to 

/ 2

.  The  SHG  conversion 

inP

efficiency and the absorption are plotted in Fig. 4. We stress the two phenomena related to the 

modulation of the relative phase difference: (i) for  φ

Δ = , SHG is enhanced by a factor of ~4 

0

with  respect  to  the  efficiency  achieved  by  a  single  pump  pulse;  for  φ

Δ =   we  see  a  drastic 

π

inhibition of SHG as a consequence of the reduced density of modes and anti-localization of the 

light field; (ii) if we define the absorption losses in the cavity as A=1-T-R, where T  is the total 

(fundamental  and  second  harmonic)  energy  flowing  in  the  forward  direction,  normalized  with 

respect to 

inP , and R the total, normalized energy flowing in the backward direction, the value of 

A  is  then  drastically  reduced  when 

Δ =
φ

180

° .  This  effect  is  due  primarily  to  the  reduced 

interaction  time  in  the  cavity  (or  increase  of  effective  the  group  velocity),  so  that  the  pulses 

interfere destructively  giving rise to a reduced density of modes when they reach the center of 

the structure. Under the circumstances, we find that  while each individual pulse transits through 

the cavity in its pre-established direction, they do not interact with the meta-material.   

In conclusion, we have studied the SHG process inside a NIM cavity, under condition of 

local phase matching between the pump and the second harmonic signal.   Given an input power

relative phase of the incident pulses acts as the control mechanism of these phenomena.

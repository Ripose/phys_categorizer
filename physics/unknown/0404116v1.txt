Abstract. - A novel experiment to test special relativity via Lorentz symmetry
has  become  factible  thanks  to  three  recent  technological  achievements:  huge
Michelson-like set-up with arms 3 km long (Virgo) and 4 km (Ligo) with beam
paths  respectively  reaching  120  km  and  200  km  through  multiple  reflections,
ultrashort laser pulses of 10-15 s and ultrafast detectors of 10-12 s resolution. The
alliance of these three elements would allow checking the equality of the time-
of-flight  of  the  two  orthogonal  beams  with  a  resolution  high  enough  to  allow
prospecting  in  a  novel  way  the  equivalency  of  inertial  system  postulated  in
special relativity. In effect, for a beam path length of 120 or 200 km and a net
drift velocity of earth of 370 km/s relative to the cosmic microwave background
(CMB), a classical analysis predicts a time-of-flight  difference  of  the order of
10-9  s  between  the  two  orthogonal  beams,  while  relativity  infers  them  to  be
equal.  So,  what  is  under  scrutiny  is  the  exhaustivity  of  the  electromagnetic
equivalency  of  inertial  systems.  A  null  time-of-flight  difference  would
strengthen  the  Lorentz  symmetry,  while  a  non  null  result  would  bring  a
threshold  to  the  equivalency  of  inertial  systems  and  at  the  same  time  would
provide a tool to define their speed, which should be equal to that relative to the
CMB for being congruent.

    Introduction  -  An original experiment, exploiting the Virgo (1) or Ligo (2) set-
up for testing Special relativity in a still unsound aspect rooted in the direct access to
the  differential  measure  of  the  two  orthogonal  laser  beams  time-of-flight,  is
proposed.  In  effect,  these  gravitational  wave  observatories  rely  on  a  huge
Michelson-Morley  interferometer  (3),  whose  two  orthogonal  arms  measure  3  km
and  4  km  respectively  and  whose  beam  path  lengths  reach  120  km  and  200  km
through  multiple  reflections.  Such  lengthy  paths  allow  the  differential  measure  of
the  beams  time-of-flight.  The  new  test  would  not  rely  in  evidencing  the  phase
invariance  versus  speed  of  the  two  orthogonal  beams  upon  recombination,  but
instead  on  the  direct  detection  of  any  time-of-flight  difference  between  them.  This
type  of  measurement  was  unworkable  up  to  now  and  only  the  alliance  of  three
modern  technological  advances,  specifically  the  outstanding  features  of  the  Virgo
and Ligo set-up, ultrafast laser with femtosecond pulses and ultrafast time-of-flight

detectors  of  picosecond  resolution,  allow  to  envision  reaching  this  incisive  and
crucial experiment.
    Let us rough out the conjecture. The principle of Lorentz invariance stipulates that
the  result  of  any  experiment  must  be  formally  independent  of  the  speed  of  the
inertial  system  on  which  it  is  performed.  Explicitly,  since  the  first  postulate  of
special  relativity  states  that  inertial  systems  are  equivalent,  this  is  to  say  that  the
time-of-flight of the two orthogonal beams must be independent of speed otherwise
Lorentz  symmetry  (4)  would  be  infringed.  This  is  precisely  the  point  that  the
experiment  would  insure  since  the  interpretation  of  its  result  does  bear  any
ambiguity, which is not the case in electromagnetic experiments relying on the wave
nature of light such as Michelson-type interferometric experiments (5), as we have
pointed  out,  suggesting  that  the  null  result  can  be  interpreted  as  being  due  to  the
influence of the Doppler effect on the wave period  (6). This misgiving applies to all
experiments relying on the beams wave-length, period or phase, inducing mistrusts
on  the  factual  cause  for  Lorentz  invariance  settled  in  special  relativity.  Therefore,
the direct access to the differential measure of the beams time-of-flight would bring
a decisive proof on Lorentz symmetry, free of any reliance on the two beams phase
and thus of any imponderable influence of the Doppler effect.
    So, in order to stay away from any interpretative doubts, the null time difference
between the two beams time-of-flight in Michelson-like experiment is aimed to be
checked  taking  advantage  of  the  pertinent  modern  facilities,  which  would  allow
detecting  any  deviation  from  conformity  with  Lorentz  symmetry.  The  classical
analysis of the time-of-flight through ray optics predicts a time difference between
the two beams: ∆t = tx - ty = (d / c) (v / c)2. Knowing that the earth has a mean net
drift  velocity  relative  to the  CMB  of  the  order  of  370  km/s  and  for  beam  paths  of
120 or 200 km, a classical viewpoint predicts a time difference of the order of 10-9 s,
time  which  fits  within  the  ultrafast  detectors  range  of  reach  (7-15).  This  time
difference corresponds to the case in which one arm is aligned with the direction of
the  speed  vector  and  represents  its  maximum  value  (fig.1),  but  it  is  null  when
oriented along the meridian axis of the two arms due to symmetry (fig.2). According
to special relativity the time difference should be independent of any orientation and
always  null.  Since  the  two  beams  make  a  round  trip  back  to  the  same  point  of
incidence,  the  differential  measure  of  their  time-of-flight  can  be  achieved  with  a
single photodetector.

the  experiment
    Experimental  and  methodology  -  As  already  expressed, 
addresses to the time-of-flight method instead of the interferometric method. Let us
evaluate  the  time-of-flight  difference  to  be  detected  by  means  of  such  lengthy
orthogonal beams path:

tx = (d / c) / (1 - v2 / c2) ≈ (d / c) (1 + v2 / c2)

ty = (d / c) / sqr (1 - v2 / c2) ≈ (d / c) (1 + 1/2 v2 / c2)

∆t = tx - ty = (d / c) (v / c)2

For a beam path of 120 or 200 km and a speed of the inertial system of 370 km/s:

∆t = tx - ty = (d / c) (v / c)2 = (120/3 105) (370/3 105)2  ≈ 0.6 x10-9 s = 0.6 ns

∆t = tx - ty = (d / c) (v / c)2  = (200/3 105) (370/3 105)2 ≈ 1.0 x10-9 s = 1.0 ns

Comparatively, in the Michelson-Morley experiment the arm length was of 1 m and
the beam path was of 11 m through multiple reflections, therefore the corresponding
classical time-of-flight difference between the two orthogonal beams would be:

∆t = (d / c) (v / c)2  = (11/3 108) (370 103/3 108)2= 4.10-14 s = 40 fs

and thus it is not directly detectable.

The procedure to ascertain the results would mainly rely on three check-up:

(a) To insure that any time-of-flight difference would not be due to a difference of
length between arms the measure would be repeated, interchanging the arm aligned
in the direction of our galaxy drift motion, using the earth spin to get the change in
the  arms  orientation.  If  due  to  a  difference  of  the  arms  length  the  time-of-flight
difference would not vary, but if not the sign of the difference would be inverted.

(b) Also, another check up would consists on orienting the axis of symmetry of the
system  in  the  direction  of  our  galaxy  drift  (fig.2),  the  time  difference  being  then
expected to be null whatever the system speed. Any time-of-flight difference would
thus be to a difference between of the arms length or to an artefact.

(c)  Still,  an  extra  assessment  implies  that,  when  one  arm  is  oriented  in  the  earth
cosmic  drift,  the  speed  derived  from  an  eventual  time-of-flight  difference  between
the  two  orthogonal  beams  should  be  equal  to  its  drift  speed  relative  to  the  CMB.
Any tangible departure from equality would be incongruent.

    Conclusion  - The proposed experiment would allow to test in a still unsound way
the  equivalency  of  inertial  systems,  and  possibly  to  ratify  Lorentz  symmetry.  So,
what would be under scrutiny is the exhaustivity of the electromagnetic equivalency
of  inertial  systems.  An  invariantly  null  time-of-flight  difference  between  the  two
orthogonal beams would strengthen the first postulate while a non-null result would
bring a threshold to observer Lorentz invariance, and at the same time would allow

to get a new way to define the drift speed of earth through the cosmos. Both speeds,
that relative to the CMB and any eventual one deriving from a non null result should
be equal. Any deviation from equality would jeopardise the reliability of the result.
On the contrary, a systematically null result would extend the equivalency of inertial
systems  and  still  strengthen  Lorentz  symmetry  postulated  in  special  relativity.  It
would  thus  be  a  misuse  not  to  take  advantage  of  the  extraordinary  possibilities
offered  by  the  Virgo  and  Ligo  huge  set-up  to  extend  their  usefulness  beyond  a
circumscribed  endeavour  to  detect  gravitational  waves.  Besides,  let  stress  that  the
proposed time-of-flight experiment represents a less challenging aim.

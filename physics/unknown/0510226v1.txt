An analysis of stellar interferometers as wavefront sensors

Abstract: This paper presents the basic principle and theoretical relationships of an original 

method  allowing  to  retrieve  the  Wavefront  Errors  (WFE)  of  a  ground  or  space-borne 

telescope when combining its main pupil with a second, decentered reference optical arm. 

The  measurement  accuracy  of  such  a  “telescope-interferometer”  is  then  estimated  by 

means  of  various  numerical  simulations,  demonstrating  a  high  performance  excepted  on 

limited areas near the telescope pupil rim. In  particular, it allows direct phase evaluation 

(thus avoiding the use of first or second-order derivatives), which is of special interest for 

the co-phasing of segmented mirrors in future giant telescopes projects. We finally define 

the useful practical domain of the method, which seems to be better suited for periodical 

diagnostics of space or ground based telescopes, or to real-time scientific observations in 

some very specific cases (e.g. the central star in extrasolar planets searching instruments).

1. Introduction 

 

1

The purpose of this paper is to present an unusual measurement method allowing the retrieval of 

wavefront  errors  emerging  from  a  ground  or  space-borne  telescope.  Such  Wavefront  Sensors 

(WFS) are widely spread in the field of astronomy, where many different principles have already 

been  proposed.  Among  them  however,  only  three  or  four  major  concepts  have  been  deeply 

studied  and  practically  realized.  They  are  the  Shack-Hartmann  sensor1-2  based  on  micro-lens 

arrays  placed  at  the  exit  pupil  of  the  telescope  (evaluating  the  first-order  derivatives  of  the 

wavefront,  then  reconstructing  it  digitally),  the  shearing  interferometer3  also  measuring  first-

order  derivatives,  the  curvature  sensor4-5  estimating  second-order  derivatives,  and  the  most 

recently proposed pyramidal WFS6. However these methods are hardly applicable for evaluating 

the  piston  errors  of  large  segmented  mirrors  or  multi-apertures  telescopes,  since  they  are  all 

based on slopes or curvature measurements. In the last decade, this type of mirrors have already 

been  implemented  –  or  are  under  development  –  in  a  few  outstanding  ground  or  spaceborne 

facilities such as the Keck telescopes, the Gran Telescopio Canarias or the James Webb Space 

Telescope (JWST). In the future they will probably become the building blocks for all Extremely 

Large  Telescope  (ELT)  projects,  and  so  new  alignment  and  control  technologies  may  be 

developed jointly. 

It must be highlighted that direct phase measurements – including piston errors – are also 

feasible  by  means  of  image-based  sensing  methods  such  as  phase  retrieval  or  phase  diversity 

procedures7-8.  For  example,  they  were  successfully  applied  to  the  Multiple-Mirror  Telescope9 

and  are  the  current  baseline  for  the  co-phasing  of  the  JWST  hexagonal  mirrors,  using  a 

Gerchberg-Saxton  algorithm10.  However,  such  techniques  usually  require  significant  post-

processing  time  and  are  not  well  suited  to  adaptive  optics  operation.  The  “ideal”  wavefront 

sensor  should  indeed  combine  the  advantages  of  both  methods,  i.e.  the  ability  to  perform 

 

2

absolute  phase  measurements  in  quasi  real-time  –  typically  corresponding  to  100  Hz  time 

frequency for ground telescopes affected by atmospheric disturbances. 

Such  techniques  have  already  been  proposed  by  several  authors:  let  us  mention  the 

wavefront  sensors  described  by  Angel11-12  and  Codona13,  based  on  a  Mach-Zehnder 

interferometer that could be integrated to extrasolar planets searching instruments. Alternatively, 

Labeyrie  suggested  an  adaptive  holographic  correction  method14.  Herein  is  proposed  a  quite 

different principle, inspired from the Michelson stellar interferometer that is famous in the field 

of astronomy since the beginning of the 20th Century15. In the section 2 are described the basic 

principle and theoretical relationships of the proposed method according to Fourier optics theory. 

It  essentially  consists  in  adding  a  second,  decentered  optical  arm  to  the  main  telescope  pupil, 

thus generating a spatially modulated Point Spread Function (PSF) that is recorded on a detector 

array.  Then  the  Optical  Transfer  Function  (OTF)  of  the  system  can  be  digitally  computed  by 

means  of  an  inverse  Fourier  transform,  providing  quantitative  information  about  the  telescope 

WFE  (it  may  be  noticed  that  Takeda16  followed  a  comparable  approach  for  interferometric 

fringe-pattern  analysis).  The  basic  principle  is  validated  by  several  numerical  simulations 

presented  in  the  chapter  3,  whereas  three  possible  implementations  on  real  telescopes  are 

described and discussed in the section 4. Finally, the chapter 5 gives a short conclusion about the 

future potential developments of the method. 

2. Theoretical principle 

The  general  principle  of  the  proposed  method  is  illustrated  in  the  Figure  1,  where  the  studied 

telescope is characterized by its exit pupil diameter D = 2R and focal length F – both allowing to 

define its aperture number F/D – and affected with an unknown wavefront error ∆(x,y). Then a 

 

 

3

second optical arm is added into the pupil plane, from where the light emitted by the same sky 

object  is  combined  to  the  principal  beam.  The  associated  aperture  presents  the  three  following 

characteristics: 

magnitude at least) 

than 3R + r) 

•  Property n°1: its radius r is sensibly smaller than the telescope radius R (i.e. by one order of 

•  Property  n°2:  it  is  decentered  with  respect  to  the  telescope  optical  axis  of  a  significant 

quantity denoted B (standing for “baseline”. It will be established later that B must be greater 

•  Property n°3: its output beam is converging at the telescope focus and is assumed to be free 

of phase or alignment defects. In other words it can be considered as diffraction-limited and 

generating a spherical reference wavefront. 

The  coherent  addition  of  the  complex  amplitudes  propagated  from  both  apertures  will 

form  an  interference  pattern  in  the  focal  plane  of  the  telescope,  where  the  intensities  are 

measured by  means  of  quadratic detectors  as in  classical stellar  interferometers.  The  measured 

intensity distribution can also be considered as the PSF of the global system, from which its OTF 

can  be  digitally  computed  through  an  inverse  Fourier  transform  algorithm.  In  the  following 

pages, the telescope pupil will be named “main pupil”, while the decentered optical arm is the 

“reference  pupil”.  Thereby  we  shall  seek  out  analytic  expressions  of  the  PSF  and  OTF  of  the 

system, assumed to contain quantitative information about the phase errors in the main aperture. 

2.1 PSF recorded on the detector 

Let us consider the coordinates systems represented on the Figure 1, where: 

•  Z is the optical axis of the considered telescope 

4

 

 

•  OXY is the exit pupil plane of the telescope, centered on the main aperture 

•  O’X’Y’ is the focal plane of the telescope, where the PSF intensities will be measured. The 

point O’ coincides with the telescope focus

Figure 1: Coordinates systems 

Let  us  denote  BR(x,y)  the  two-dimensional  amplitude  transmission  function  of  the 

circular pupil, uniformly equal to 1 inside a circle of radius R, and zero outside of this area – this 

is the “pillbox” or “top-hat” function. If λ is the wavelength of the incoming light (assumed to be 

monochromatic),  the wave  emerging  from  both  telescope  apertures  can  be  written  in the OXY 

plane:

where  ∆(x,y)  is  the  telescope  WFE  to  be  estimated,  and  AR  and  Ar  respectively  are  constant 

amplitudes in the main and reference pupils (in the most frequent case their numerical values are 

5

nearly  equal).  It  can  be  noticed  that  no  phase  error  is  associated  to  the  reference  optical  arm 

according  to  the  aforementioned  property  n°3.  In  the  frame  of  scalar  diffraction  theory  and 

Fraunhofer approximation, the wave generated in the focal plane O’X’Y’ is obtained by Fourier 

transformation of AP(x,y):

Here M(u,v) and Ψ(u,v) respectively represent the dimensionless modulus and the phase

2J1(x)/x – see ref. 17, section 8.5 – with no additional phase term since the wavefront is assumed 

to  be  free  of  defects.  Hence  when  combining  relations  (3)  to  (5)  the  complex  amplitude 

AP’(x’,y’) formed in the focal plane becomes:

It  must  be  noticed  that  this  last  expression  includes  a  cosine  term  proportional  to  the 

product  CAC,  which  is  indeed  very  similar  to  the  usual  formulation  of  classical  stellar 

interferometry. Here the modulated component generates a weak intensity fringe pattern added to 

the  telescope  PSF.  This  effect  is  clearly  observable  on  the  Figure  2  where  is  reproduced  an 

intensity distribution  calculated  for  the  first  reference  WFE  studied  in the  section 3  –  see  case 

n°1, “pure defocus”.

Having determined the theoretical equations (9-10) of the PSF effectively acquired on the 

focal plane of the telescope, there only remains pure data-processing tasks. Firstly the OTF must 

be deduced from the PSF, then a phase retrieval procedure shall be defined. 

2.2 OTF computation and phase retrieval 

Classically  the  Optical  Transfer  Function  (OTF)  of  an  optical  system  is  equal  to  the  inverse 

Fourier transform of its Point Spread Function (PSF). However the OTF is generally expressed 

in terms of the pupil spatial frequencies fx and fy where fx = x/λF and fy = y/λF, and is limited by 

its cut-off frequency fc = 2R/λF above which it is uniformly equal to zero. Here the OTF is re-

scaled to the pupil plane coordinates x and y by simply ignoring the initial variable substitutions 

in the focal plane (i.e. u = x’/λF and v = y’/λF). Hence from equation (9) the resulting function 

CP(x,y) can be split into four major terms:

Although an analytical development of the CP1(x,y) to CP4(x,y) terms is straightforward 

in  Fourier  optics  theory,  it  is  fully  detailed  into  the  Appendix  in  order  to  define  the  exact 

normalizing factors and the resulting contrast ratio. Therefore it can be shown that:

where  OR(x,y)  and  Or(x,y)  respectively  are  the  OTFs  of  the  main  and  reference  pupils,  each 

being considered individually, and the symbol ⊗ denotes a convolution product. Even if they are 

scaled  to  pupil  coordinates  instead  of  spatial  frequencies,  these  functions  are  similar  to  the 

typical “Chinese-hat” profiles described in ref. 17, section 9.5. Hence when normalizing CP(x,y) 

such that its maximal value (at x = y = 0) is equal to 1, we finally obtain:

In  the  Figure  3  is  provided  a  schematic  representation  of  the  modulus  of  the  complex 

function CP(x,y), which is indeed the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the two-aperture 

optical  system  (see  also  the  Figure  4  corresponding  to  the  defocus  example  in  section  3).  It 

shows that both the MTF and OTF are constituted of four terms being interpreted as follows:

Figure 4: Typical example of a global MTF (logarithmic scale) 

 

1)  The first term proportional to OR(x,y) is nothing else than the OTF of the main aperture, i.e. 

the transfer function of the telescope taking into account its limited diameter and transmitted 

wavefront error ∆(x,y) 

2)  Likewise, the second term is proportional to Or(x,y) that is the OTF of the reference pupil. 

Given  that  it  is  proportional  to  the  contrast  ratio  C  and  that  its  radius  2r  is  significantly 

 

 

 

smaller  than  R  (see  the  property  n°1),  it  can  be  assumed  that  this  function  has  negligible 

influence with respect to the first term 

3)  The  third  component  is  by  far  the  most  interesting:  firstly  because  it  is  a  crossed  term 

between both main and reference pupils appearing as a convolution product and involving a 

complex  function  whose  phase  is  directly  related  to  the  searched  wavefront  error  ∆(x,y). 

Secondly, because it is shifted of an algebraic distance -B along the X-axis, meaning that it 

can  easily  be  separated  from  the  other  terms  provided  that  the  effective  value  of  B  is  high 

enough to prevent any spatial overlap between them. As the maximal – or “cut-off” – radius 

of OR(x,y) is 2R and the diameter of the convolution product is at most equal to 2(R+r), we 

deduce that the condition to be strictly fulfilled is: 

B  >  3R + r 

(14) 

4)  Finally the fourth term appears as a rigorous replication of the previous one, rotated of 180 

degrees  around  the  optical  axis  and  centered  on  the  +B  coordinate  along  the  X-axis,  thus 

being symmetrical with respect to point O. In theory this crossed-symmetrical term does not 

contain any additional information. 

In  order  to  isolate  the  crossed  term  between  the  main  and  reference  pupils  in  equation 

(13), we shall multiply it by the pillbox function BR+r(x+B,y) of radius R+r and centered on the -

B coordinate, then shift the whole result of the opposite quantity +B toward the origin O. This 

leads to the following relation:

This last  result proves  that  the  third  component  of  the  OTF  is  equal  to the  convolution 

product  of  the  complex  amplitude  transmitted  by  the  main  telescope  aperture  with  a  circular 

pillbox  function  Br(x,y)  uniformly  equal  to  1  inside  the  radius  r.  Obviously  the  equation  (15) 

could be resolved by means of a deconvolution process. However such algorithms often require 

extensive  computing  times  and  are  not  easily  applicable  to  quasi  real  time  operation.  Another 

solution consists in referring to the first property stipulating that r is negligible with respect to the 

main  telescope  radius  R.  Thus  the  function  Br(x,y)/πr2  can  be  approximated  to  the  Dirac 

distribution  δ(x,y),  and  the  convolution  product  in  Eq.  (15)  might  be  neglected  –  it  must  be 

noticed  that  this  approximation  is  all  the  more  valid  as  the  r/R  ratio  tends  to  decrease. 

Consequently it may be assumed that:

This  last  relationship  concludes  the  theoretical  study,  since  we  have  then  defined  a  procedure 

allowing  phase  or  WFE  reconstruction  from  the  PSF  generated  at  the  focal  plane  of  a  two-

aperture  telescope  system.  However,  it  must  be  emphasized  that  the  absolute  accuracy  of  the 

method  shall  suffer  from  an  intrinsic  measurement  error  originating  from  the  “delta 

approximation” of Eq. (16). Therefore its actual performance needs to be quantified from a few

practical examples: this is the main scope of the numerical simulations presented in the following 

section. 

3. Numerical simulations 

In order to validate the global WFE retrieval procedure and to estimate its intrinsic measurement 

error, we developed a simulation routine following the main steps detailed below: 

1)  Firstly,  the  wavefront  error  ∆(x,y)  to  be  measured  is  imported  from  an  external  file.  It  is 

considered  as  a  reference,  to  be  finally  compared  with  the  retrieved  data  in  step  n°9.  Four 

different  reference  WFEs  are  studied  here  as  described  hereafter.  Their  spatial  sampling  is 

typically around 100 x 100, as indicated in the Table 1 

2)  Phase errors proportional to ∆(x,y) are added to the main aperture of the telescope, which is 

included  together  with  the  reference  pupil  into  a  complex  array  AP(x,y)  according  to  the 

relation (1). The reference aperture is typically de-centered of 400 pixels from the origin and 

sampled by 10 x 10 pixels. Phase errors can also be associated to it, although this was not 

undertaken here. The dimension of the computing array is adjustable, but experience showed 

that the best results are obtained from a 1024 x 1024 sampling. Larger array sizes only result 

in prolonged computing time without any observable gain on the measured performance 

3)  The complex amplitude distribution AP’(x’,y’) in the telescope focal plane is then evaluated 

via a direct Fourier transformation of the 1024 x 1024 complex array following the relation 

(2) 

4)  AP’(x’,y’) is multiplied by its complex conjugate in order to simulate the PSF of the global 

system measured by the CCD detector matrix, that is IP’(x’,y’). No photon or read-out noises 

are added. At this stage the optical simulation is completed and the following steps consist in 

pure data-processing 

 

13

5)  According to the general relation (11), the OTF of the system is computed in the pupil plane 

by means of an inverse Fourier transform 

6)  The resulting complex distribution CP(x,y) is multiplied by a pillbox function of radius R+r 

centered on the -B coordinate, and the result is shifted of +B along the X-axis according to 

the relation (15). Thus the crossed OTF term is extracted from CP(x,y) 

7)  The estimated wavefront error of the telescope is derived from the previous data according to 

the relation (17) 

8)  As  equation  (17)  can  only  provide  numerical  values  ranging  from  0  to  λ  (or  from  -λ/2  to 

+λ/2), a phase unwrapping algorithm  must be applied to the estimated WFE if these limits 

are exceeded. Such procedures have been extensively studied and optimized in the frame of 

laser-interferometer metrology and are widely spread in scientific literature. Here we utilized 

the algorithm originally proposed by Takeda16 adding some of the improvements suggested 

by Roddier18 

9)  Finally,  the  recovered  and  eventually  unwrapped  WFE  is  compared  with  its  reference  (see 

step n°1) by direct subtraction of their two-dimensional maps. 

Numerical simulations were conducted for a telescope having an exit pupil diameter 2R = 

500 mm and a focal length F = 5 m, thus having an effective aperture number of 10. The baseline 

B between the main and reference apertures is always equal to 1 m with Ar = AR, meaning that 

CA = 1 according to the relation (8.a). All the other input parameters are provided in the Table 1 

as  well  as  the  most  significant  numerical  results  of  the  simulations.  Before  discussing  the 

numbers  compiled  in  this  Table,  the  four  different  considered  wavefront  errors  are  described

Case  n°1  (Figure  5):  This  is  a  “pure  defocus”  defect,  meaning  that  the  tested  telescope 

does not suffer from any manufacturing error or phase disturbance, but that the focal plane – or 

the  CCD  detector  itself  –  is  shifted  by  a  small  amount  along  the  Z  optical  axis.  Therefore  the 

WFE is reduced to a spherical term (here equivalent to one wavelength PTV, see Table 1). In the 

Figure 5 are displayed from left to right the original wavefront error in the main telescope pupil, 

the  modulus  of  the  crossed  OTF  term  obtained  at  the  step  n°6  of  the  numerical  model,  the 

reconstructed wavefront error in step n°7, and the two-dimensional difference map between the 

original  and  estimated  WFEs.  As  also  illustrated  by  the  cross-sections  of  Figure  6,  it  can  be 

noticed that the major discrepancies are located near the contour of the main aperture, where a 

sudden slope discontinuity occurs. The width of the corrugated zone corresponds to the radius r 

of  the  reference  pupil.  This  inherent  measurement  error  directly  originates  from  the 

 

 

15

approximation of Eq. (16), because the convolution product tends to integrate useful information 

located inside the telescope aperture radius R with meaningless data found outside of it.

Case  n°2  (Figure  7):  These  are  low  spatial  frequency  defects,  engendered  either  by 

polishing  errors  and  mechanical  deformations  of  the  telescope  mirrors,  or  by  an  incorrect 

alignment between them: typical examples are coma and astigmatism aberrations. Here the WFE 

amplitude is higher than one wavelength, thus the unwrapping algorithm mentioned in the step

n°8 had to be used. As in the previous example, the difference map (d) reveals the typical slope 

discontinuity inherent to the convolution product.

Case n°3 (Figure 8): Here we consider the particular case of segmented mirrors that will 

equip  the  future  ELTs.  In  the  Figure  8  is  shown  a  main  pupil  constituted  of  seven  hexagonal 

facets, some of which are affected with piston errors presenting the following characteristics: the 

first and central segment is assumed to be the reference optical surface having a zero piston (i.e. 

the surrounding mirror petals are aligned with respect to it). Then, turning clockwise from the Y-

axis,  the  other  reflective  segments  present  successive  piston  errors  of  λ/2,  λ/4,  -λ/4,  -λ/2,  -λ/4 

and λ/4 (a). The radius r of the reference pupil had to be reduced with respect to both previous 

examples (see Table 1) in order to enhance the spatial resolution near the edges of the mirrors. It 

can  be  seen  that  the  modulus  of  the  crossed  OTF  term  (b)  reproduces  a  blurred  picture  of  the 

transmission map in the main pupil, while the piston errors are actually retrieved on the whole 

mirror  segments  (c),  excepting  restricted  areas  located  near  the  boundaries  of  each  petal  (d). 

Although  the  case  was  not  studied  here,  it  may  be  assumed  that  a  slightly  enlarged  reference 

pupil would still allow to restore the piston errors.

Case  n°4  (Figure  9):  These  are  random  defects,  representative  of  optical  path 

disturbances encountered during the propagation into turbulent atmospheric layers and observed 

in  the  exit  pupil  plane  of  ground  telescopes  (i.e.  the  astronomical  seeing).  Such  effects  are 

nowadays corrected by advanced adaptive optics systems requiring fast frequency WFS1-6. They 

often  are  high-amplitude  defects  (equivalent  to  several  wavelengths),  thus  the  use  of  phase 

unwrapping algorithms is absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, as the other digital procedures are 

well  suited  to  quasi  real-time  processing  (inverse  Fourier  transform,  filtering  and  phase 

extraction),  we  have  studied  if  the  proposed  method  can  be  employed  for  this  purpose.  Here 

again the radius r of the reference pupil had to be reduced, but in lesser proportions than for the 

prior example: the actual reason was to avoid large phase variations averaged on the reference 

aperture, inducing MTF values close to zero – as seen on the upper region of Figure 9-(b) – and 

subsequent phase extraction errors occurring at step n°7 of the numerical model. The difference 

map  (d)  also  shows  the  typical  slope  discontinuity  already  noticed  in  the  first  and  second 

examples.

Figure 9: Reference (a) and reconstructed WFEs (c) of random defects, and their two-dimensional difference-

All the numerical results obtained for these four typical cases are compiled in the Table 1, 

where are indicated the PTV and RMS values of the reference and reconstructed WFEs, and of 

their difference maps as well as global estimates of the error percentage. The obtained accuracy 

is  ranging  from  around  λ/11  to  λ/4  PTV  and  from  λ/88  to  λ/55  RMS,  and  thus  always  stays 

within the diffraction limit of the main telescope. It may seem at a first glance that the proposed 

method  is  less  accurate  than  other  current  WFE  measurement  techniques  such  as  Shack-

Hartmann or image-based sensing. However it must be pointed out that the major discrepancies 

originate from the slope discontinuity generated by the convolution product near the main pupil 

rim. For cases n° 1, 2 and 4, it can be assumed that a much better accuracy is achieved over a 

circular  sub-aperture  of  radius  R-r  excluding  the  corrugated  areas.  However  such  a  “pupil 

reduction” process is only appropriate to some particular cases (for example the defocus or low 

spatial frequency defects that can realistically be extrapolated by Zernike polynomials), and this 

is the reason why it was not studied here. In other words such improvements of the measurement 

accuracy are feasible, but can only be envisaged on a case-by-case basis. 

But perhaps one of the most decisive advantages of the technique was confirmed by the 

third  example:  it  shows  that  direct  information  about  the  searched  wavefront  is  accessible, 

19

instead  of  utilizing  its  slopes  or  curvatures.  This  allows  a  simultaneous  retrieval  of  the  co-

phasing errors of segmented telescope mirrors, which is of prime interest in view of future ELT 

projects.  Therefore  the  method  can  be  thought  as  an  efficient  tool  for  regular  controls  of  the 

telescope alignment and performance – in other words, an active optics or image-based sensing 

technique.  Furthermore,  its  capacities  in  the  field  of  adaptive  optics  remain  to  be  assessed, 

despite of the encouraging results presented in the last example. 

Although  this  study  should  be  pursued  in  order  to  determine  the  optimal  values  of  the 

system parameters (and particularly those of the reference pupil diameter), we will now provide 

a few examples of practical implementations on an existing telescope. This is the purpose of the 

following section. 

4. Practical implementation and other considerations 

Having  asserted  the  general  principle  of  an  original  wavefront  sensing  method  and  defined  its 

basic  theoretical  relationships  (section  2),  then  demonstrated  its  capacities  through  various 

numerical  simulations  (section  3),  we  describe  hereafter  three  potential  examples  of 

implementation on a real telescope. 

The first configuration is illustrated on the Figure 10 and shows a typical telescope from 

the  Cassegrain  family where  both primary  mirror  (M1)  and  secondary  mirror  (M2)  have  conic 

surfaces. The telescope is considered as the main pupil of the two-aperture optical system, while 

the second reference arm is schematically represented at the bottom of Figure 10: it is composed 

of  two  off-axis  mirrors  having  the  same  curvatures  and  conic  constants  than  the  primary  and 

secondary mirrors, being de-centered of a quantity equivalent to B along the X-axis (i.e. they are 

direct extensions of the M1 and M2 optical surfaces). Hence this configuration can be seen as a 

Fizeau stellar interferometer where one of the two apertures has been significantly reduced, and 

 

20

folding  mirrors  are  added  to  the  reference  arm  for  compactness  purpose.  The  latter  also 

comprises a Delay Line (DL) maintaining an equal Optical Path Difference (OPD) between both 

telescope  pupils,  for  example  driven  by  a  Piezoelectric  Transducer  (PZT)  tube  –  a  necessary 

condition to observe the modulated PSFs shown in Figure 2. It may be noticed that due to the 

different  number  of  reflective  surfaces  encountered  along  each  optical  arm,  the  transmitted 

amplitudes  AR  and  Ar  will  not  be  equal,  thus  justifying  a  posteriori  the  introduction  of  the 

contrast ratio CA in the section 2.

Figure 10: Implementation on a real telescope. The Fizeau configuration 

 

The second example slightly deviates from the previous one. As can be seen in the Figure 

11,  the  reference  pupil  arm  is  no  longer  composed  of  the  same  type  of  mirrors  than  the  main 

telescope,  but  of  a  dioptric  (or  eventually  catadioptric)  telephoto  lens  system  having  the  same 

focal length than the telescope, again incorporating folding mirrors and a PZT delay line. This 

configuration cannot be related to the Fizeau family since the continuity of the optical surfaces 

between  both  interferometer  arms  vanishes.  Conversely,  it  cannot  be  seen  as  a  Michelson-like 

21

stellar  interferometer  where  the  light  is  usually  collected  from  several  telescopes  of  the  same 

type, then transported towards a beam combiner via relay optics. Therefore it will be called the 

“intermediate”  configuration.  It  is  indeed  very  similar  to  the  first  one,  eventually  offering  the 

advantages of a more compact optical layout and reduced bulkiness.

Figure 11: Implementation on a real telescope. The intermediate configuration 

The  third  and  last  proposed  arrangement  (see  Figure  12)  radically  differs  from  the 

previous ones. It is indeed a Michelson configuration involving two different telescopes coupled 

by  fiber  optics  as  in  the  FLUOR  interferometer19:  the  first  one  still  corresponds  to  the  main 

aperture where the WFE is to be measured, while the second “Auxiliary Telescope” (AT) can be 

of intermediate size between the main and reference pupil diameters. The light collected by the 

AT  is  then  focused  at  the  entrance  of  an  optical  fiber  and  finally  injected  into  the  main  beam 

from  an  off-axis  angle  equivalent  to  B,  via  focusing  optics  and  two  folding  mirrors.  Several 

options can be envisaged in order to equalize the OPDs between both interferometer arms: for 

example a classical delay line (similar to those mentioned in the preceding configurations) could 

be  implemented  near  the  input  or  output  sides  of  the  fiber,  which  would  certainly  require 

22

additional optics. But the best solution probably consists in incorporating the DL to the optical 

fiber itself, as represented in the Figure 12. This can be realized by means of a ceramic cylinder 

PZT as demonstrated by Reynault20.

Figure 12: Implementation on a real telescope. The Michelson configuration 

Two important peculiarities of the “Michelson” configuration must be highlighted below: 

• 

In this case the numerical values of the wave amplitudes AR and Ar might significantly differ 

from each other, and the diameter of the auxiliary telescope could be adjusted so that Ar > 

AR, implying a contrast ratio CA higher than 1 and thus an amplified PSF modulation term – 

proportional  to  CA,  see  the  relation  (10).  Therefore  the  measurement  accuracy  of  the 

wavefront  could  be  improved.  It  must  be  noticed  however  that  this  may  be  detrimental  to 

scientific  exposures  since  the  diffraction  effects  originating  from  the  reference  pupil  are 

proportional to CA

2. 

•  A potential difficulty may be to maintain a sufficient image quality over the whole surface of 

the  auxiliary  telescope,  that  is  supposed  to  provide  a  spherical  reference  wavefront.  For 

23

ground facilities it entails that the atmospheric seeing is well corrected, either by an adaptive 

optics system or by means of passive WFE filtering techniques. The optical fiber itself could 

be used for that purpose21. 

Among many other possibilities, the three schematic configurations here above described 

demonstrate that the concept of such “telescope-interferometers” may not be just a dream, even 

if  substantial  effort  will  be  required  before  they  can  actually be  realized.  In  this perspective,  a 

few basic questions about their domain of practical use are still to be discussed. 

Wavelength  range:  this  crucial  question  concerns  the  spectral  characteristics  (peak 

wavelength and width) of the observed luminous source. At a first glance it may seem that the 

reconstructed phase do  not  depend  on  the  considered  wavelength  λ  since  the  OTF  is  scaled  to 

pupil  dimensions  by  means  of  the  intermediate  variables  (u,v)  –  see  the  relations  (4)  to  (10). 

Unfortunately this is untrue since the PSFs actually recorded on the detector array depend on the 

(x’,y’) coordinates and not on (u,v). Therefore the inverse Fourier transform of equation (11) has 

to be calculated for a given reference wavelength λ0, e.g. the peak wavelength of the observed 

object. Then at different wavelengths the OTFs will be re-scaled by geometrical similarities of 

ratio λ0/λ, consequently scrambling the information available on the main pupil area. Hence the 

light source must either be a spectral line or filtered on a narrow spectral bandwidth (typically a 

few percents). The choice of the peak wavelength λ0 does not seem to have a critical influence 

on the accuracy of the method, but rather on its measurement range as discussed below. 

Maximal  wavefront  amplitude:  it  has  already  been  highlighted  in  section  3  that  if  the 

amplitude  of  the  estimated  wavefront  is  greater  than  the  useful  wavelength  λ0,  a  phase-

unwrapping  algorithm  must  be  implemented.  But  in  some  cases  this  may  lead  to  information 

 

 

24

loss,  for  example  when  the  co-phasing  errors  of  segmented  mirrors  must  be  evaluated  (see 

section 3, example n°3). In that case higher reference wavelengths λ0 could be selected by means 

of spectral filtering. For very-high amplitude phase errors infrared sources might be used if they 

can provide sufficient energy. 

Angular  source  size  and  Field  of  View  (FoV):  these  are  two  other  essential  issues.  It 

readily  appears  that  in  order  to  avoid  PSF  modulation  drops  the  angular  size  of  the  observed 

source should not exceed the resolving power of the equivalent stellar interferometer, that is λ/B 

–  where  B  must  comply  with  the  relation  (14).  Practically,  this  means  that  the  candidate  sky 

objects may be restricted to natural stars of a few tenths of milli-arcseconds diameter, and that 

the method is not compatible with laser guide stars. Besides, the useful FoV of the system will be 

subject to the classical limitations of stellar interferometry, which is a vast theme far beyond the 

scope of this paper. Let us simply remind that the Fizeau configuration is reputed for having the 

widest  FoV,  which  may  give  preference  to  the  two  first  proposed  arrangements  (“Fizeau”  and 

“intermediate”). Even in that case however, it seems difficult to process simultaneously different 

sky objects without any readjustment of the delay line. It can then be concluded that unless the 

DL  system  is  deeply  modified,  the  method  is  not  suitable  for  multi-conjugate  or  ground-layer 

adaptive optics, and is mostly applicable to unresolved central stars, such as those observed by 

extrasolar planets searching instruments. 

Delay  Line  range  and  accuracy:  following  the  previous  hypothesis  (i.e.  negligible  FoV 

requiring a moderate DL compensating range), the measurement uncertainty should not be very 

sensitive  to  OPD  equalization  errors:  their  major  effect  is  indeed  to  add  a  global  piston  to  the 

estimated  WFEs,  from  which  it  will  finally  be  subtracted  digitally.  Therefore  only  a  moderate 

 

25

positioning  accuracy  should  be  required  for  the  delay  line,  and  its  practical  design  could  be 

greatly simplified and not very expensive. 

Science and reference pupil baseline: the point is here to define the optimal value of the 

baseline B separating both telescope apertures: it has been shown in section 2 that the inequality 

(13) has to be strictly respected in order to prevent any overlap between the different OTF terms. 

Moreover  a  small  margin  should  naturally  be  added  to  this  lower  limit.  However  it  can  be 

assumed  that  larger baselines will  probably have  little beneficial influence  on  the  WFE  spatial 

resolution  and  measurement  accuracy,  because  the  system  does  not  act  as  a  real  stellar 

interferometer. On the contrary, the precision could even be decreased for very long baselines, 

since  the  PSF  spatial  modulation  may  become  hardly  observable  by  means  of  CCD  detector 

arrays.  Therefore  it  seems  preferable  to  keep  the  baseline  parameter  B  close  to  its  lower  limit 

(i.e. 3R + r). 

Image  quality  of  the  reference  arm:  when  referring  to  Twymann-Green  or  Fizeau 

interferometers  commonly  used  for  optical  surfaces  metrology,  it  might  be  expected  that  the 

reference  telescope  arm  must  fulfil  stringent  image  quality  requirements  (as  suggested  by  the 

property  n°3  in  section  2).  Sensitivity  analyses  were  carried  out  using  the  numerical  model 

described in the section 3, and showed that wavefront errors of λ/4 PTV (in both tilt and defocus) 

are equivalent to half the intrinsic measurement accuracy of the method. Therefore the reference 

telescope  should be diffraction-limited  according  to the Rayleigh  criterion, and does  not  really 

need to be totally free of phase or alignment defects as initially assumed in section 2. Obviously 

some more detailed image quality budgets will need to be assessed in the future. 

Photometry and noise aspects: flux and noise issues probably represent the most critical 

areas  of  the  method,  at  least  for  an  adaptive  optics  operating  mode.  Given  the  aforementioned 

 

26

characteristics of the observed source (i.e. limited to a narrow spectral bandwidth and unresolved 

by  the  interferometer  baseline),  it  might  be  feared  that  poor  Signal-to-Noise  Ratios  (SNR)  are 

barely  achieved  on  a  limited  number  of  sky  objects.  However  this  key  question  requires  a 

dedicated  study  that  will  be  the  scope  of  another  paper,  thus  only  general  considerations  are 

given here. Let us consider for example the case of photon noise: referring to Eq. (10) the total 

collected flux is proportional to A’2, so the photon noise will depend on A’. However the useful 

signal from which the phase will be extracted is equal to 2 A’2 CA C, implying that the effective 

SNR is proportional to πr2 CA = S CA where S and CA respectively are the collecting area and 

concentration ratio of the reference telescope. When considering the largest existing facilities or 

the  future  ELT  projects,  the  diameter  of  the  reference  telescope  should  attain  a  few  meters, 

provided that it is assisted by its own adaptive optics system. Thus the SNR naturally increases 

with the size of the considered facility. In addition, a major enhancement should result from the 

“Michelson”  configuration 

incorporating 

larger  Auxiliary  Telescopes  with  significantly 

improved concentrating ratios (i.e. CA >1). 

5. Conclusion 

In  this  paper  was  discussed  the  theory  and  expected  performance  of  a  wavefront  sensing 

technique  inspired  from  stellar  interferometry.  Firstly,  we  described  the  basic  principle  and 

theoretical relationships allowing WFE or phase retrieval on a ground or space-borne telescope 

when combining its main pupil with a reference off-axis optical arm. The measurement accuracy 

of  such  a  “telescope-interferometer”  was  then  estimated  from  various  numerical  simulations, 

demonstrating a high performance excepted on limited areas located near the telescope pupil rim. 

In addition, it was shown that direct phase evaluation is achieved (thus avoiding the use of first 

or second-order derivatives), which is of prime interest for the co-phasing of segmented mirrors 

 

27

in  view  of  innovative  projects  such  as  the  future  ground-based  ELTs  or  the  Terrestrial  Planet 

Finder (TPF). We finally attempted to define the useful practical domain of the method, which 

seems  well  suited  to  periodical  diagnostics  of  ground  or  space  telescopes  (in  other  words,  an 

active  optics  or  image-based  sensing  technique)  or  to  real-time  scientific  observation  in  a  few 

specific cases (e.g. the central star in extrasolar planets searching instruments). 

It  seems  clear  however  that  some  important  issues  mentioned  in  the  previous  section 

must be examined in depth. Using our numerical model, a thorough analysis of the measurement 

errors will be conducted, including noises and non-linearity of the CCD detector, useful spectral 

range and angular size of the observed sky objects, scintillation effects, etc. This should be the 

scope  of  another  paper  currently  under  preparation,  and  of  future  tradeoffs  with  respect  to 

classical WFS or image-based sensing techniques. But it already appears that some experimental 

results would be of great interest in order to assess the validity and predicted performance of the 

method. A gradual approach divided into three steps is suggested below: 

•  A  laboratory  test-bench  should  be  firstly  developed,  allowing  to  check  the  measurement 

accuracy and to assess several physical characteristics of the envisaged light sources (such as 

spectral width, angular size and brightness), thus answering to  the major open questions in 

• 

If  proved  successful,  a  real  telescope-interferometer  could  be  built  by  adding  a  reference

In order  to evaluate  the  ultimate  performance of  the  method, the  last  step would consist in 

implementing  it  on  a  large-scale  telescope.  For  example,  experiments  carried  out  on  the 

Large  Binocular  Telescope  (LBT)  or  on  the  Very  Large  Telescope  Interferometer  (VLTI)

would respectively allow to compare the Fizeau and Michelson configurations described in 

the previous section. 

 

 

 

 

 

Appendix: computation of CP(x,y) 

According  to  the  relation  (11),  CP(x,y)  is  a  linear  combination  of  four  different  terms  that  are 

analytically developed below. 

Expression of CP1(x,y) 

This  term  appears  as  the  inverse  Fourier  transform  of  M2(u,v)  that  is  the  PSF  of  the  main 

telescope aperture. It can be rewritten as follows: 

C

P1

(x,

y)

=

FT

1
−

[
2
(u,M

]
v)

=

(u,

)
v)

×

v)M(u,

(
i

Ψ−

(u,

]v)
)

 

(A.1) 

and then expressed as the convolution product – here denoted ⊗ – of two complex conjugated 

functions: 

C

P1

(x,

y)

=

FT

1
−

[
v)M(u,

⊗

FT

−

[
v)M(u,

(

exp
Ψ−

(u,

]v)
)

 

(A.2) 

According to the relation (4) and to the properties of Fourier transformations for complex 

conjugates, CP1(x,y) is consequently equal to: 

C

(x,

y)

⎠

 

(A.3) 

It can be noticed that the expression (A.3) is proportional to the auto-correlation function 

OR(x,y) of the complex amplitude in the main pupil, which is another classical definition of the 

OTF17. Knowing that OR(x,y) is always normalized such that OR(0,0) = 1, we find that:

(A.4) 

and then, combining both previous relationships: 

Expression of CP2(x,y) 

The same demonstration than for the previous term easily leads to:

(A.5) 

(A.6) 

Expression of CP3(x,y) 

According to the relation (11) the expression of CP3(x,y) is: 

C

P3

(x,

y)

=

FT

1
−

[
v)M(u,

m(u,

(A.7) 

that can be decomposed into a multiple convolution product: 

C

P3

(x,

=

−

[

⊗

(A.8) 

Then, from the relations (4-5) and the basic properties of Fourier transforms:

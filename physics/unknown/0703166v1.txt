was  determined  by 
thermo-gravimetric  analysis  and  also 
confirmed by directly measuring the weight of absorbed water. A 
second  sample  was  then prepared using D2O in  order  to  subtract 
out the incoherent signal from hydrogen atoms of the RNA. Both 
hydrated  samples  had  the  same  water  or  heavy  water/dry  RNA 
molar  ratio.  Differential  scanning  calorimetry  analysis  was 
performed in order to detect the absence of any feature that could 
be associated with the presence of bulk-like water. 

It  is known  that many proteins  exhibit  sharp  slowing  down  of 
their functions (kinetics of biochemical reactions) at temperatures 
within  the  interval  T~240-200  K.  1,2  It  has  also  been  shown 
experimentally3-5  and  computationally6,7  that  there  is  a  sharp 
increase of the mean-squared atomic displacement <x2> in protein 
at  about  TC  =  220  K,  suggesting  a  dynamic  transition  (the  so-
called  glass  transition)  in  proteins  at  this  temperature.  There  is 
strong evidence that this glass transition is solvent induced, since 
the  hydration  water  of  the  protein  also  shows  some  kind  of 
dynamic  transition  at  a  similar  temperature.8-10  In  our  previous 
research,11  it  was  demonstrated  that  this  dynamic  transition  of 
hydration  water  on  lysozyme  protein  was,  in  fact,  a  fragile-to-
strong dynamic crossover (FSC) at 220 K.   

More recently, we also showed that hydration water on B-DNA 
exhibits  a  similar  FSC  at  TL  =  222  K.12  To  assess  whether  this 
glass  transition  temperature  TC  of  proteins  is  universal  for  other 
kinds  of  bio-polymers,  experiments13,14  and  computations15  were 
performed  on  these  other  biopolymers.  However,  in  these 
experimental works, there were no explicit demonstrations of the 
FSC phenomenon of the bio-molecules’ hydration water.  

This  paper  presents  a  new  evidence  of  the  universality  of  TC. 
From  the  measurement  of  mean-square  atomic  displacement 
(MSD) of H-atoms in RNA and its hydration water, the similarity 
of the dynamic transition in RNA and its hydration water suggests 
that  the  dynamic  transition  in  RNA  is  also  induced  by  its 
hydration  water,  despite  differences  in  the  architecture  and 
chemical backbones of proteins, DNA and RNA.  

Using  high-resolution  quasi-elastic  neutron  scattering  (QENS) 
spectroscopy, we demonstrate decisively that there is a sharp FSC 
temperature  of  the  hydration  water  on  RNA  at  TL=220  K.  The 
change  of  mobility  of  the  hydration  water  molecules  across  TL 
drives the dynamic transition in RNA which happens at the same 
temperature.  The  coincidence  of  the  crossover  temperature  in 
proteins,11 DNA,12 tRNA14 and RNA reinforce the plausibility that 
the  glass  transitions  are  not  the  intrinsic  properties  of  the  bio-
molecules themselves but are imposed by the hydration water on 
their surfaces. 

Ribonucleic  acid  from  torula  yeast  (RNA)  was  obtained  from 
Sigma (R6875, batch number 021k7063) and used without further 
purification.  The  sample  was  extensively  lyophilized  to  remove 
any  water  left.  The  dried  RNA  powder  was  then  hydrated 
isopiestically at 5°C by exposing it to water vapor in equilibrium 
with  a  NaClO3  saturated  water  solution  placed  in  a  closed 
chamber (relative humidity, RH =75%). The final hydration level

measured  by  an  elastic  scan  with  resolution  of  0.8 μeV,  as  a  function  of 
temperature for the H2O hydrated and D2O hydrated RNA samples. Panel 
A  shows  the  data  processed  from  the  difference  between  the  two,  which 
gives MSD of the H-atoms in the hydration water. Panel B shows the data 
processed from the latter, which gives MSD of H-atoms in RNA. One can 
clearly  see  from  the  two  panels,  moderately  sharp  transition  of  slopes  at 
around  220  K,  indicating  that  the  dynamic  crossover  temperatures  of  the 
RNA (TC) and the hydration water (TL) are approximately the same.  

 
Neutron  scattering  measurements  were  done  on  the  High-Flux 
Back-Scattering  spectrometer  at  NIST-CNR  with  a  resolution  of 

0.8 μeV and a dynamic range of  ±11μeV . The elastic scans were 
measured  at  a  heating/cooling  rate  of  0.75  K/min.    It  is  used  to 
deduce  the  mean-squared  hydrogen  atom  displacement  <x2>, 
shown in Fig. 1A (from the difference signal of the two samples) 
and Fig. 1B (from the D2O hydrated sample).

approximately  the  same  (within  the  error  bars  of  the  kink

is  some  kind  of  crossover 
temperature existing at around 220 K, judging from the variation

sharper  definition  of  this  dynamic  crossover  temperature  TL  can 
be  obtained  from  RCM  analysis  of  the  difference  spectra  of  the

We have shown in this paper a clear experimental evidence for the 
existence  of  a  super-Arrhenius  to  Arrhenius  dynamic  crossover 
(TL) in  RNA  hydration  water  at  220  K  and  proposed  a  plausible 
reason that the dynamic crossover of the hydration water triggers 
the  onset  of  the  glass  transition  at  the  same  temperature  (TC)  in 
RNA.      We  have  shown  before  that  above  TL  the  structure  of 
hydration water is predominately in its high-density form (HDL), 
which is more fluid. But below TL, it transforms predominately to 
the low-density form (LDL), which is less fluid. Thus this abrupt 
change in the mobility of hydration water apparently induces the 
change in the energy landscape of RNA, which cause the dynamic 
transition or the glass transition in the biopolymer.

represents  fitted  curves  using  the  VFT  law,  while  the  solid  line  is  the 
fitting according to the Arrhenius law.

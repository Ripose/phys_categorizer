Abstract  We  present  a  Fourier  transform  methodology  for  all-order  PMD  analysis,  based  on  the  first  Born 
approximation to the coupled-mode equation solution. Our method predicts wavelength-dependent PMD effects and 
allows design of filters for their mitigation.

Introduction 

 

Polarization  mode  dispersion 
(PMD)  has  been 
extensively studied [1-6], and can be characterized to 
first order in terms of differential group-delay (DGD-1) 
in  the  fiber  principle  states  of  polarization  (PSP-1). 
Second  order  effects  such  as  polarization-state 
rotation  or  depolarization  (DEP-2),  and  polarization 
chromatic  dispersion  (PCD-2)  are  of  concern,  as 
40Gb/s  channel  data  rates  become  commercial 
reality.  In  this  paper,  we  show  how  high-order  PMD 
trajectories on the PoincarØ sphere surface [7] can be 
understood  using  coupled-mode  theory.  A  Fourier 
transform (FT) basis allows a scaleable filter method, 
shown below in figure 1, which enables compensation 
of all PMD orders on both a static and dynamic basis.

Theory 
Generally,  PMD  is  not  a  problem  of  signal  energy 
loss, but of dispersion. A signal is characterised by its 
amplitude and phase, as they vary in the temporal and 
frequency domains. Classically, the energy of a signal 
is  only  a  function  of  the  amplitude,  so  if  a  signal 
suffers  distortion  but  no  energy  loss,  that  distortion 
only arises due to phase variation. Hence, PMD must 
be  a  phase  problem,  which  is  correctable  using 
phase-only  compensation  techniques,  such  as  all-
pass  filters  (APFs)  [8].  We  note  that  for  a  causal 
signal, the amplitude and phase must be related via a 
Hilbert  transform,  so  that  phase  variation  must  imply 
an  amplitude  variation,  and  hence  energy  loss.  But, 
due  to  its  relative  unimportance,  we  neglect  this 
aspect  in  the  following  analysis.  PMD  is  caused  by 
energy  coupling  between  the  two  non-degenerate 
polarisation modes of standard SMF, and hence it can 
be  analysed  using  coupled-mode  theory.  Using  the 
notation of Yariv [9], we write:

indicates  that  both  high  and  low  birefringences  have 
small coupling coefficients, which is to be expected for 
HiBi  (polarisation  maintaining)  fibre,  and  perfectly 
degenerate SMF respectively. This leaves the general 
case  of  standard  non-degenerate  SMF,  where 
polarisation  mode-coupling  is  an  important  issue. 
Since  the  PMD  coupling  is  considered  weak,  we  can 
employ the first Born approximation to the solution of 
the  coupled-mode  equations  to  yield  the  scattering 
probability for coupling between modes 1 and 2:

,  2nd-
the  dispersion  of  the  DCM  by  a  further 
order  PMD  can  be  compensated  by  a  single  active 
dispersion compensator of magnitude  D−  in only one 
of  the  arms,  as  indicated  in  figure  1.  Higher-order 
dispersions  [12]  (without  a  common  compensator 
before  the  MZI)  require  phase-conjugated  dispersion 
compensators  for  full  compensation,  as  indicated. 
Optical lattice filters would be ideal candidates for this 
type of application.  
 
Conclusions 
We  have  described  a  complete  FT  model  for  PMD 
effects  using  the  first  Born  approximation  technique 
for  solution  of  the  coupled-mode  equations.  Not  only 
does it allow PMD effects to be modelled by standard 
signal  theory,  but  appropriate  mitigating  filter  designs 
can  also  be  synthesised.  In  addition,  we  have  shown 
how  polarization  trajectories  on  the  PoincarØ  sphere 
surface  due  to  PMD  effects  can  be  understood  from 
coupled-mode theory.

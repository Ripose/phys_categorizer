ABSTRACT 

Laser drilling becomes of increasing importance when hole diameter is in the range of 10 to 50 µm, for which conven-
tional  alternative  approaches  are  becoming  difficult  and cost  inefficient.  Furthermore,  it  is  viewed  as  the  technique  of 
choice for a number of composite materials and hard materials which are not readily processed at the microscopic level 
by contact mechanical tools. We have demonstrated that suitable experimental conditions are capable of producing mi-
croholes with record aspect-ratio (up to 600) in pure polymers like PET, PI, PC, PS, PMMA, PEEK, .. . For example 
holes of diameter typically 30 µm can be as long as 18 mm, depth at which the drilling rate is getting nearly zero and the 
profile stationary. Other materials (metals, ceramics) which can be similarly laser microdrilled do not exhibit such very 
high aspect-ratio. The mechanisms of the drilling process have been studied in details and an original analytical model 
has been constructed recently. The various experimental results, obtained with the KrF laser, will be reviewed with em-
phasis on the parameters leading to formation of good holes with high aspect-ratio. For the application it is also impor-
tant  to  note  that  such  high  values  of  aspect-ratio  are  obtained  with  regular  configuration  of  the  KrF  laser  giving  a 
standard divergence of 3 mrad. However as shown by the model there is still room for improvement by using a beam 
with a lower divergence (theoretical limit is 0.2 mrad). Further experimental work is now in progress.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Microdrilling is one of the key processes for future technology and industry. Conventional mechanical drilling has to 
face increasing physical limitation when hole diameter is  decreased. Below some critical dimension, friction surpasses 
the  mechanical  strength of  the  tool  and  machining  is possible only by choosing  specially  designed  tools  made  of high 
modulus  materials  (e.g.  diamond,  cBN,  etc..)  Additionally  processing  time  may  be  increased  and  tool  lifetime  may  be 
sacrificially reduced. In any case it means that the cost of the process can be prohibitively increased. In this context laser 
microdrilling [1-11] offers an attracting alternative to mechanical machining and is already widely used in numerous ap-
plications. In particular the same laser tool can process similarly any material regardless its physical properties (hardness, 
softness, composite, absorptivity .. ), although mechanisms of material removal can be very diverse. In this framework 
we have recently [12-16] investigated the ultimate limits of laser microdrilling mainly in polymeric materials. In particu-
lar  with  respect  to  the  two  dimensions  of  interest  in  microdrilling  applications,  hole  diameter  (d)  and  maximum  hole 
length (l) are obtained for a given set of laser parameters (wavelength, beam 
size,  energy  density).  In  the  present  work  we  show  that  unprecedented  high 
aspect ratio (R=l/d, up  to 600)  can be  reached when  experimental  conditions 
are adequately chosen. We have experimented mainly with polymers however 
results  can  be  transposed  to  other  materials  (metal  ceramics..)  with  more  or 
less complications. The first consideration can be guided by the simple equa-
tion (1) giving laser waist size d after transformation of a gaussian laser beam 
of  initial  diameter  D  by  a  single  lens  (Fig.1)  of  focal  length  f    [ 17 ]:

Fig. 1 Beam transformation by a single lens 

Small beam diameter is favoured by choosing a short laser wavelength and small focal length. To illustrate this: a beam 
of 3 µm is obtained with a KrF laser (l =248 nm) with a lens of 20 mm focal distance for an incident beam size of 1 mm. 
For comparison an infrared CO2 laser beam (l =10.6 µm »
 43x0.248 µm) would give a 43 times larger spot (d=120 µm). 
For the same initial laser pulse energy the fluence at the waist would be accordingly much lower (~(l KrF/l CO2)2» 1/1850) 
because spread over a larger surface area. Therefore ultraviolet lasers are better candidates for making small spots of high 
energy density in order to perform high aspect ratio holes by deep ablation. Moreover in UV, thresholds of ablation are 
low because absorption coefficients g are high (~105 cm-1). Therefore energy density thresholds Ft (threshold fluence) can 
be easily surpassed and the large excess of energy with respect to the threshold value provides the large kinetic energy 
necessary to expulse the ablated material outside the deep hole. In the present state of the art, powerful KrF lasers (0.4 
J/pulse, 200 Hz) are mainly used because of the high demand in pulse number of microdrilling, but other shorter wave-
lengths (e.g. ArF, or VUV) are also considered although suffering of lower energy per pulse and/or lower repetition rate. 
It is also envisageable that, in the future, laser with even shorter wavelength (far-UV, X-ray) will be considered owing to 
their large potential of focusability. Other advantage of ultraviolet radiation is the high energy content of the photon (e.g. 
hn  = 5 eV for 248 nm) which is large enough to cause direct bond breaking by single photon absorption. Polymers are 
long chain molecules. Part of the incident energy is converted into heat giving rise to phase transition like solid-to-liquid 
and  complex  mechanisms  of  liquid  expulsion  can  also  take  place.  Large  wavelengths  lasers,  having  photon  energy 
smaller than average polymer bond energy, gives higher tendency to thermal mechanism, less direct decomposition into 
gas and larger affected volume around the keyhole as explained below. Therefore although efficient drilling is obtained 
with such lasers in a wide range of applications, the best performances in terms of microscopic precision (lateral diame-
ter) are now obtained with short wavelength lasers. The efficiency of ultraviolet laser of a given energy having nanosec-
ond pulses in microdrilling is then due to the synergy of high focusability and high absorption coefficient usually encoun-
tered in solid materials which gives low ablation threshold and making possible ejection of material with the high kinetic 
energy to deep drilling. This paper starts with a description of the experimental setup stressing the strategic points. From 
the experimental results reported in part 2 below we will see that maximum aspect ratio increases with fluence as pre-
dicted by the model presented in part 3. The model also predicts hole profile, beam transmission in the keyhole and a 
polymer fluence threshold which could well be the minimum energy to significantly remove some materials after incuba-
tion or ablation with many pulses. In following part 4, mechanisms and perspectives will be discussed. 

 

2. MICRODRILLING EXPERIMENT 

In  these  experiments  good  microdrilling  is  obtained  only  when  the  laser  microbeam  has  a  high  quality  over  the  large 
depth of the wanted hole, i.e. high energy density, smooth profile and small lateral dimensions. Microdrilling reveals to 
be in itself a good test of the beam quality that can easily be used by the experimentalist for adjusting the optical setup. 
Any other photon detector (like a camera) is in the present case useless or inconvenient since the density of energy used 
is too high and the size of the beam too small.  

2.1  Laser beam setup

aid  of  a  nickel  grid  placed  at  the  mask  whose  image  is 
looked  for  in  the  waist  by ablation  with  one  pulse  on  PC 
surface. d  = 0 is by definition the image position.

The laser beam setup is shown in Fig.2. It is composed of two silica (Suprasil) plano-convex lenses. One is the condensor 
(fcond=250 mm) and the other is the projector (f=25 mm). The are chosen of small diameter in order to keep the thickness 
at the beam path to a minimum and avoid unwanted attenuation of the radiation (they must stand 200 pulses/sec for min-
utes with good stability). The use of a precision lens [18] as projection optics is not completely excluded, but was not 
preferred for this particular study. The excimer laser is a Lambda Physik LPX 220i (pulse energy E=0.4 J, pulse duration 
t=25  ns,  pulse  peak  intensity  I=E/t=1.6x107  W  and  repetition  rate  200  Hz  maximum)  whose  cavity  is  equipped  with 
regular planar aluminium mirrors and which has a length of about 1.50 m, therefore offering a maximum of energy in the 
low divergence resonator modes. A circular molybdenum aperture (e.g. F
 = 250 µm) is used to shape the beam at a dis-
tance of the condensor equal approx. to fcond.. This mask is precisely imaged onto the polymer surface, as illustrated in 
Fig.3, with the projection lens so that the demagnification ratio is of the order of 1/5. A fine nickel grid (Goodfellow, pe-
riod 340 µm) is placed on the mask and the polymer target is moved near the waist position up to obtaining a good posi-
tion giving the best ablation pattern (which is then called defocus zero d  = 0 )as seen in the optical microscopy image in 
upper left inset in Fig.3. Polycarbonate is used for this fine adjustment made with one single pulse, since its ablation is 
clearly not disturbed by liquid formation and lateral flow along the surface. It proved to be a very sensitive technique. 
Two diaphragms are also used to limit the influence of scattered radiation, which are positioned before each lens. Their 
adjustment is done on an empirical basis.  

2.2  Polymer samples 
The  selected  polymer  samples  were  chosen  in  a  first  series  because  of  their  good  optical  and  surface  quality  (PC,  PS, 
PMMA, PET) allowing an easy optical microscope observation and in a second series for their technological importance 
(PI  and  PEEK).  The  polymers  studied  are  polyimide  (PI),  poly(ethylene  terephthalate)  (PET),  polystyrene  (PS), 
poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC). Commercial 
names are Kapton for PI, Mylar D for PET, Stabar for PEEK. PS samples were taken from Petri dish and PC samples 
from polycarbonate panels Axxis (DSM Engineering Products). As seen from Table 1, PI, PET and PEEK have high ab-
sorption coefficient, whereas PMMA, PS and PC are weak absorbers at room temperature for the used laser wavelength. 
It gives the possibility to study the effect of this important parameter on the results of drilling.

A  typical  microdrilling  experiment,  done  after  beam  optimisation,  is  illustrated  in  Fig.4.  It  requires  usually  many 
pulses. As in Fig.4 A, the rate has an initial value (a) which can be related to surface ablation with 3D expansion charac-
teristic of surface ablation (as opposed to deep ablation), then it displays a constant value (b) in deep keyhole because 
plume absorption is increased and redeposition sets in, and finally it goes to a “zero value” (c) when the stationary profile 
is reached. As in Table 1 with an average rate of 0.7 µm/pulse the stationary profile is reached in approximately 7500 
pulses. The intermediate pictures A,B,C are respectively taken at 3000, 4500, 6000 pulses. We observe the evolution of 
the main ablation front or hole bottom which is rather square at the beginning and which becomes sharper when the sta-
tionary  state  or  end  of  drilling  is  approached.  When  the  stationary  state  is 
reached the tip does not move anymore, the lateral dimensions of the hole do not 
change as well. The laser energy is therefore trapped within the hole and spread 
over the hole inner surface so that its surface density is lowered below ablation 
threshold. This result can be better understood with a simplified model of a coni-
cal hole in Fig.5 (we will see below that the hole profile is not conical). An ideal 
fully  collimate  beam  however would  create  the  formation  of  a  cone of angle  a
 
and aspect ratio 1/a
. The drilling then would stop when the fluence at the wall is 
a certain threshold F¥  so that    F0s0 = F¥ s = F¥ s0/a    (2) 
.    From  this  aspect 
ratio can be estimated for example as follows:   
  (3),   since the threshold F¥  at which the drilling stops is lower than the usual 
surface ablation threshold Ft. With typical fluence F0 = 30 J/cm² and threshold Ft

tionary  state  of  a  drilled  conical 
hole. 

  R = 1/a  = F0/F¥  > F0/Ft    

 

= 30 mJ/cm² , an aspect ratio of the order of 103 would be predicted. This is comparable to what experience gives. 
 
 

2.4  Other polymers 
 

PET under the form of Mylar D, presented above gives the best aspect ratio (Table.1) then there is a group with PC 
PEEK and PI which displays lower aspect ratio Rm ~350 and PMMA, PS have the lower values. It is interesting to under-
stand why, when chemical structure is varied, the microdrilling performance is so strongly affected. This particular point 
will be discussed below with the presentation of drilling features related to each specific polymer. 

 

2.4.1  Polycarbonate (PC) 

 

Polycarbonate  also  gives 
high aspect ratio holes (Ta-
ble  1).  The  surface  after 
ablation  has  a  black  color 
characteristic  of  carbon 
material,  already  observed 
in  multipulse  surface  abla-
tion  of  PC.  As  we  already 
reported  at  some  point  of 
the  drilling  a  branching 
phenomenon  can  be  ob-
served.  In  Fig.6  it  appears 
at  the  tip  end  when  the 
laser  fluence  is  attenuated 
to  values  in  the  vicinity  of 
the  threshold  value.  The 
mechanism of formation of the branches [16] is analogous to the formation of cones, reported in surface ablation. They 
form because the absorbed fluence FA(i)cos(i) becomes equal to Ft (i is the beam incidence angle). This branching is a 
specific phenomenon of polycarbonate and other polymers like PI and PEEK. They hold in common the characteristic of 
yielding by ablation graphite to a large extend, whereas other polymers PET, PS and PMMA much less. It is also thought 
that expulsed ablation products are gases and nanoparticles as opposed to liquid micro and nano droplets in other cases.

ence of the first one.

An example of KrF laser drilled hole in PMMA is shown above in Fig.7 with a magnification which allows to reveal sev-
eral interesting features concerning the drilling mechanism. Its aspect ratio is only R=100 in the Fig.7 and not the maxi-
mum aspect ratio Rm=250 (Table 1) because its diameter does not allow to reach the fluence value high enough to reach 
Rm. A smaller diameter beam (~30-35µm) obtained with a smaller molybdenum mask (30 x 5 = 150 µm) yields the more 
energetic spot capable of reaching the maximum aspect ratio Rm of Table.1. One main difference with the previous case 
of PC is the shape of the end tip which is now completely round instead of branched. This is due to the presence of liquid 
although viscous PMMA polymer during the laser interaction. The liquid surface tension produces a meniscus at the bot-
tom of the hole which resolidifies between two consecutive pulses. Such liquid is not produced in drilling of the other 
polymers PC, PI, PEEK and since it is formed an ultrathin layer [19,20] in the ablation of PET, it seems to have a negli-
gible effect on its drilling. SEM imaging in Fig.8 displays the redeposited PMMA droplets around the hole entrance. Liq-
uid expulsion may be a significant mechanism of material removal in the case of PMMA. Recently we also demonstrated 
the experimental conditions in which nanofilaments [21,22] are formed by droplet expulsion with a single laser pulse. In 
these  cases  speed  of  liquid  ejection  can  be  as  high  as  840  m/s  (~Mach  3)  according  to  our  recoil  pressure  model  and 
depending on the fluence used. Details of the hole surface can be seen in Fig.7 where in particular some microcracks are 
visible. It is difficult at this point to explain their mechanisms of formation but their presence is not surprising since the 
PMMA material is exposed to a large dose of UV and the P ant T pulses in the hole during microdrilling have large am-
plitude and impose some strain to the target. Also due to the large penetration depth ~150 µm involved in PMMA (Ta-
ble.1) we can imagine that a cylindrical shape affected volume is formed around the hole where molecules receive a lot 
of photonic and thermal excitation. This volume was measured by microraman spectroscopy.  

2.5  Search for the optimum aspect ratio 
 
As included in Table.1, there exists a maximum aspect ratio Rm. It is mainly a function of polymer type when drilling is 
performed with the same beam for all polymers. But it is also sensitive to beam diameter since beam fluence is the main 
controlling  parameter  in  these  experiments.  We  determined  that  aspect  ratio  varies  with  the  beam  fluence  like  : 
=
RR
  in  which  Fc  is  a  fluence  characteristic  of  the  polymer  [12].  Now  the  fluence  which  can  be  ob-
m
tained at the waist center is the very important parameter since it should be as large as possible to drill deeper, as sug-
gested by  equation  (3).  It  is  made  larger by  decreasing  the  size  of  the  beam  but  at  some  point  the  diffraction  tends  to

spread the beam over a larger solid angle. This is the reason of the maximum aspect ratio Rm that we can demonstrate in 
these experiments. It is obtained with a beam diameter of the order of 25-30 µm depending on the polymer and it is a 
limitation due to the laser beam characteristics.  
 
 

3. MODEL  

The analytical model presented below was described in details in previous publications [15,16]. The laser radiation 
approximated as in Fig.9a by a collimated beam such that it diverges from the focal point O of the projection lens P and it 
gives a spot of diameter d at the surface of sample S positioned in the image plane of the mask M. So in the model, O is 
like a virtual point source (Fig.9b) shedding some light rays onto the sample and into the hole in a cone of half angle a 0. 
The laser geometrical parameters are determined by the cone of light emitted by O in direction of the hole and defined by 
distance z0, the cone angle a 0  (numerical aperture of the beam) and the fluence profile (flat top, gaussian, etc..) which 
will be taken as a function of the inclination a  of a particular ray (Fig.9b). We show by the present model that the hole 
geometry is predetermined by these fixed parameters. The model was validated by fitting the experimental hole length 
l(F) with the predicted law. For some reason related to hole diameter increase at stationary profile the aspect ratio R is not 
suited for this fit.

Fig.9  a) Schematic beam set-up used in the modelling of laser hole drilling. b) Point source model with ray propagation into 
the laser drilled hole. O is a virtual point source at distance z0 of the sample and emitting rays in a cone of angle a0 into the 
hole with intensity varying with inclination a (laser profile). Hole diameter is strongly exaggerated for the sake of better view-
ing. 

3.1  Condition of stationary profile 
 
  At the end of drilling the hole profile is stationary and therefore does not change significantly since ablation does not 
produce anymore. If it is so this means that the laser fluence absorbed at the hole surface Fa has become smaller than the 
threshold value that we named F¥ . constant over the entire surface. At point P of Fig.9b we therefore have the condition  
  Fa(r,z) = F¥    
the equation which characterises the stationary profile. F¥  is a threshold fluence at which the ablation stops, which de-
pends mainly on the polymer and on its modification introduced by the laser dose during the drilling process. We will see 
that it is fairly different from the well known ablation threshold. It is simply a threshold below which the disappearance 
of the laser excited material does not produce anymore.

nally absorbed regardless their origin since probably scattering dominates the beam propagation inside the hole. Further-

3.3  Fit of the experimental hole length for top-hat beam profile 
 
As stated above the hole aspect ratio was not taken as fitting quantity since it levels off at high fluence whereas the hole 
length continues to increase due to slow diameter increase with fluence which cannot be simply predicted by this model. 
If a constant diameter versus fluence is used besides the predicted length (12) then theoretical aspect ratio is an increas-
ing function of fluence and does not reproduce the levelling off of the experimental data. On the contrary it was found

3.4  Hole profile and beam transmission into the hole 

 

With the help of equation (11), the calculated hole profile can be plotted as in Fig.11 for a beam having a flat-top profile 
with different values of fluence. Fluence can be expressed in unit of 
, which is a particular value of fluence 
r = , providing parallel side walls at the keyhole entrance (Fig.11 curve (2)). Calculated keyhole profiles of Fig.11 
can be not only convergent but also divergent at the entrance and convergent in a deeper part (profiles 3-5 for example).

In the multiple-scattering model all rays propagating from the point source to the side walls are totally absorbed, as we 
have Aeff=1. Therefore the only contribution to the transmission is given by the energy of the rays directly reaching the 
via hole exit from the point source O. For top-hat beam the transmitted energy E(z) is then simply directly proportional to 
the solid angle at which the exit diameter is seen from the point source and the following transmission can be obtained:

From Fig.12 we see that the calculated transmission curve is nearly a linear function of depth and does reproduce well the

4. MECHAMISMS AND PERSPECTIVES 

 
The present model is a good theoretical support for explaining some features of the experimental results, in particular for 
the prediction of the geometrical dimensions of the laser drilled hole when it has reached its final stationary profile. It 
gives a reasonable answer to the question which initiated these experiments, i.e. how deep a given laser beam can drill ?  
It defines a contour surface r(a ), z(a ) where Fa(a )=F¥  and inside which the polymer is removed by ablation (ablative 
volume). It is important to note that it is independent of the pulsed character of the laser radiation. It is equally applicable 
to cw laser drilling provided the mechanism of material removal involves only a solid-to-gas transition in the absorbing 
volume when fluence is larger than the minimum for material removal F¥ . But it is not intended to explain how the drill-
ing performs in the intermediate steps. In the present pulsed laser drilling the process is repetitive with a period consist-
ing of the following sequence of events: absorption, excitation, ablation, expansion and cooling. At the frequency of our 
laser (200 Hz) it is considered that complete cooling takes place between two pulses. It means that temperature goes back 
to initial one because heat diffuses fast enough (the surface cooling time is of the order of 1-10 ms) around the hole in a 
volume strictly limited to what can be reached by the energy content of a single pulse, that is to say only ~1-102 µm in 
most cases. The absorption step is then in general done on a new cold surface for each pulse but because of transmitted 
energy decreases with depth the end of drilling is reached when on each point of the keyhole surface F(r,z) = F¥  . After 
some  time  of  drilling,  when  ablation  is  deeper  in  the  material,  redeposition  of  the  ablated  products  on  the  side  walls 
comes into play but to a more or less extend depending on the nature of the polymer and its ablation mechanisms. For 
instance PMMA is typically ablating by a thermal mechanism with the formation of a substantial amount of liquid which 
can be expulsed under the form of droplets or redeposited on the walls. Redeposition and “re-ablation” is one of the two 
main reasons which reduce the drilling rate in Fig.1A. Another reason is the increased plume shielding due to a more 1D 
expansion for deep ablation rather than the 3D for surface ablation. Furthermore at this level of fluence this strongly ab-
sorbing and expanding plume, probably a transient plasma, plays also the role of storage of the incoming energy and can 
release it to the material surface during expansion. After each pulse the plasma energy transfer to the surface can have a 
cleaning or ablative effect on the redeposited products. It is also likely that if a liquid film is formed on the inner wall 
during  drilling  it  is  accelerated  toward  the  exit  of  the  drilled  hole  by  momentum  transfered  from  the  outcoming  gas 
plume. This may also contribute to an increase of hole diameter. The nature of the laser/matter interaction is mainly la-
ser-surface but can be laser-plasma and plasma-surface with the later one being more delocalised over the entire surface 
of the hole and mainly over the side walls. Up to now little is known on the intimate mechanisms of material transport to 
the outside when the ablation front is deep in the material.  
A good control on the laser beam leading to deep ablation or machining is suitable in many laser machining approaches. 
An experimental set-up identical to ours can be used for precise or complicated cutting materials over a large thickness 
just by a computer controlled moving of the target relative to the beam : see example Fig.13 in reference [12], helical 
drilling in reference [5]. Extensive microdrilling of multi-hole arrays is also needed for some applications. Higher fre-
quency lasers [23] (up to ~5-50 kHz, 10 ps-30 ns, I = 10-20 MW for instance) are becoming available and might be of 
interest if one looks for higher processing speed. The short excimer laser wavelengths (193 and 248 nm) are preferable in 
most  cases,  but  4w
  harmonics  of  the  Nd/YAG  laser  are  interesting sources  with  the highest  frequencies.  Such 
higher frequency laser may in principle offer a larger speed of processing. Nevertheless the new problem of target tem-
perature increase may rise with increasing repetition rate of the laser pulse [23].  
Other materials like metals, ceramics and glasses can also be treated by the KrF laser beam in a similar way [24]. How-
ever due to larger thresholds of ablation (Ft and F¥ ) only much lower aspect ratio can be reached: 10-50. Furthermore the 
interest for using an ultraviolet laser is less obvious in this case. Many other sources of visible wavelength are being used 

  and  3w

9 

for these particular materials like high power copper vapour lasers [25]. Also interesting work is done with femtosecond 
lasers since virtually liquid-free ablation in metal [26], silica [27], quartz [28] and polymers [29] drilling is reported. Ul-
traviolet femtosecond laser microdrilling of polymers is of basic interest and remains a perspective for the future. 
 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  presented  recent  experimental  and  theoretical  work  on  high  aspect  ratio  microdrilling  of  polymers  with  the 
pulsed  KrF  laser  radiation.  Good  laser  beams  are  obtained  by  condensing  the  laser  on  a  circular  molybdenum  mask 
which in turn is imaged with a short focal projection lens onto the surface of the target. The best aspect ratio ~ 600 is 
obtained in PET for a 15-20 µm hole diameter and 18 mm length. 6 different polymers have been studied. Hole length 
versus  fluence  dependence  is  predicted  successfully  with  our  model,  which  also  provides  a  new  threshold  fluence  F¥ , 
minimum of energy density required for material removal. An important parameter for deep drilling is the overfluence 
ratio F0/ F¥  which determines the depth at which the drilling profile becomes stationary. This understanding will be help-
ful for many applications and future research.

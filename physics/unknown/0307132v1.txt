Abstract  Experiments at 6-12 GPa showed that San Carlos olivine surrounded by carbon 

melts incongruently at 1400 

 and higher temperatures, producing olivine with lower 

Co

Fe contents, pyroxene, carbide, and carbonate melt.  The relatively low melting 

temperature of 1400 

Co

, independent of pressure, is consistent with carbonate melting.  

The new evidence for the reduced stability of olivine at high temperatures in the presence 

of carbonate melts is consistent with geophysical observations, and results in a 

substantially improved agreement between the experimentally determined

Introduction 

  Many believe that olivine and other  (

2 SiO)Fe,Mg

4

 polymorphs stable at higher 

pressures, wadsleyite and ringwoodite, are the dominant mineral constituents of the upper 

mantle.  The experimentally determined solidus of the anhydrous peridotite KLB-1 

(Herzberg 2000; Zhang 1994) relevant for such a mantle, is hundreds of degrees higher 

than the expected temperatures of an average mantle.  In contrast, the presence of partial 

melt in the low velocity zone (Gutenberg 1948) and possibly in the depth range of 500-

1000 km (Cadek 1998; Kido 1997; Montagner 1998) is suggested by the detected high 

attenuation of seismic waves.  Partial melting of the KLB-1 peridotite was observed in 

the same experimental study (Herzberg 2000) even below the solidus temperatures, when 

graphite containers were used instead of the rhenium capsules, thus suggesting that the 

presence of graphite could lower the melting temperatures.  Carbon is known to exist in 

the mantle and thus could affect the stability and melting temperature of olivine. 

Experimental 

Diamond Aggregate 

In order to obtain new constraints on the properties of an olivine-rich mantle at high 

pressures and temperatures, we used multianvil presses to carry out experiments at 6-12 

GPa with single crystals of San Carlos olivine surrounded by a matrix of diamonds (25-

80  mµ ) enclosed in rhenium capsules.  The experimental conditions are listed in Tab. 1.  

The equipment, the 10-mm sample assembly used for the experiments, temperature and 

pressure calibrations and experimental procedures were described elsewhere (Gasparik 

1989; Li 1996). 

  When the experiments with diamonds lasting from 20 minutes to 4 hours were 

completed, the experimental products were removed from the capsules, and the diamond 

matrix was burned off in a furnace at 800

 in 2 days to ease the preparation of the 

Co

products for optical observation, microprobe analysis and transmission electron 

microscopy (TEM). 

Graphite 

A diamond aggregate has been used before to collect melt in other melting studies 

(Hirose 1993).  This technique is sometimes criticized because the pressure in the sample 

may not be uniform.  To avoid this potential problem, we assumed that graphite could 

provide the same chemical environment as diamond, and that the applied stress on the 

crystal fragment should be close to hydrostatic.  Using graphite had an additional 

advantage that the preparation of thin sections would not require burning.  Experiments 

with fragments of San Carlos olivine surrounded by graphite were carried out at 6 and 12 

GPa and 1400 

Co

, and at 12 GPa and 1300 

Co

. 

Results 

Diamond Aggregate 

  Minimal or no changes to the fragments were observed in the experimental products 

obtained at temperatures below 1400

.  However, significant changes were noted at 

Co

1400 

Co

 and higher temperatures:  The original fragments were surrounded by fine red 

whiskers, which were apparently present in the space between the diamonds before the 

burning.  Thin sections showed that the original single crystal olivine had completely 

recrystallized to a polycrystalline mosaic of grains with an average grain size of 50 

mµ .  

In the experiment carried out at 6 GPa and 1180  o

C

, the red whiskers were not present, 

and the original single crystal did not recrystallize. 

  The original San Carlos olivine and the experimental products were analyzed by 

electron microprobe.  The average compositions of phases are listed in Tab. 1.  The

.  There was no detectable change in the Fe content of the 

olivine fragment from an experiment at 10 GPa and 1400 

.  The material transported

into the diamond aggregate was analyzed in a sample obtained at 12 GPa and 1500 

Co

.  

The average sum of the cations was 4.48 per 6 oxygens, thus showing a stoichiometry 

close to olivine.  The average 

Fe

2SiO

content was 11.2 mol %, which is about 6 % 

higher than in the olivine fragment from the same experiment. 

 

In order to make observations at higher resolution from the sample obtained at 6 GPa 

and 1400 

Co

, the edge of the original fragment, which had been in contact with the 

diamond aggregate, was investigated with TEM equipped with an energy dispersive X-

ray spectrometer.  Quenched Fe rich melt was detected in the triple junctions and along 

the grain boundaries (Fig. 1.).  Dihedral angles were measured on several TEM images 

(e.g. Fig. 1.), and were found to be in the range of 0-35 o .  These low dihedral angles 

indicate that the melt in the triple junctions was interconnected.  The olivine grains were 

generally free of dislocations, indicating a low differential stress in olivine.  We used the 

Tracor EDX Detector of a Jeol 200 CX microscope to obtain the qualitative composition 

of the quenched melt, and a typical compositional spectrum is given in Fig. 2.  The 

spectrum shows that the quenched melt was extremely rich in Fe with some minor Mg.  

The virtual absence of Si indicates that the potential overlap with the surrounding olivine 

was minimal, and that the analysis was representative of the melt composition.  The EDX 

detector in use, unfortunately, does not allow the detection of light elements, such as C or 

O.  Hence, from the compositional spectrum alone, we were not able to decide what kind 

of melt was present in the triple junctions and at the grain boundaries.  We also tried to 

obtain structural information from some hexagonal looking crystals located within the 

quenched melt by using selected area electron diffraction analysis on a single grain.  The 

grain diameter of the crystals at the grain boundaries was very small, typically around 

100 nm.  This diameter is smaller than the smallest Selected Area (SA) aperture (~0.4 

mµ  in the sample image plane) that equipped the microscope.  However, we were able to 

obtain one single-crystal diffraction pattern (Fig. 3.).  The diffraction pattern is partly 

polluted by diffraction spots from surrounding crystals.  To interpret this diffraction 

pattern, we used the Electron Microscope Image Simulation (http:et al. ).  Several

FeCO

, and

most of the iron carbides,

 were tested.  We interpret the single crystal 

diffraction pattern as either

Fe3

[11,3,1] zone axis, or  Fe

, group symmetry Pnma62, orthorhombic, with the [4,-19,6] 

7C

zone axis.  We also obtained a powder diffraction pattern which indicated that the 

hexagonal looking crystals observed at grain boundaries were most likely 

CFe3

 carbide. 

 

 

 

 

Graphite 

In the experiments carried out at 1400  o

C

, full recrystallization of the original single 

crystal fragment was again observed, producing crystals with an average grain size of 

m50µ

.  The TEM investigation of the experimental product obtained at 6 GPa and 1400 

Co

 did not find any melt in the recrystallized olivine.  Microprobe analyses did not show 

a measurable change in the Fe content of olivine in the samples after the experiments in 

comparison with the original San Carlos olivine.  However, the presence of Fe, Mg, and 

Si was again detectable within graphite by electron microprobe.  These observations 

suggested that the chemical reactions and the transport of material from the original 

fragments of San Carlos olivine also occurred during the experiments with graphite.  In 

contrast, no change to the original single crystal of San Carlos olivine was observed after 

an experiment at 12 GPa and 1300

Co

. 

 

In order to obtain a measurable quantity of the transported material in graphite, the run 

duration was extended from 20-25 min to 12 hours in an experiment carried out at 6 GPa 

and 1400 

Co

.  In this experiment, small crystals dispersed in graphite were visually 

detected under a standard optical microscope (Fig. 4).  The original Fe/(Fe+Mg) atomic 

percentage of olivine was reduced from 9.09

±

0.31 % to 8.51 ± 0.15 %, and the crystals 

within graphite were identified as garnet, pyroxene, spinel, and possibly quenched melt.  

The clearly identified presence of garnet in graphite suggested that garnet might have 

been present also in the whiskers in the experiments with diamond, particularly in the 

experiment at 12 GPa and 1500 

.  In this experiment, the electron microprobe 

Co

5

analyses of four points showed a stoichiometry close to 4.0 per 6 oxygens, and the 

aluminum content of 0.3-0.7 per 6 oxygens.  However, the quality of these analyses was 

very poor due to the small size of the whiskers. 

  The microprobe and TEM investigations of the original single crystal did not detect 

anything else beside olivine.  In order to determine the source of the Al the original single 

crystal olivine was investigated by x-ray mapping.  The detected local maxima in the 

distribution of Al suggest that the San Carlos olivine contained spinel micro inclusions.  

The size of this inclusion has to be below the resolution of TEM.  The precipitation of Al-

rich spinel and enstatite in San Carlos olivine at 4.6-9.0 GPa and 1310-1595

Co

 was also 

reported (Raterron 1998). 

Discussion 

  The observed changes in the experimental products, such as the recrystallization, the 

reduced Fe content of the fragments, and the transport of material into diamond or 

graphite, suggested that the fragments of San Carlos olivine underwent partial melting.  

The melting temperature of 1400 

, observed in our experiments at 6 and 12 GPa, 

Co

seems to be independent of pressure, which is consistent with carbonate melting.  In an 

experimental study of melting of the primitive kimberlite Jd-69, the solidus temperature 

increased only slightly from 1380 to 1430

 in the pressure range of 6-12 GPa (Wang 

Co

1999). 

  We interpret the observed changes in the following way.  The presence of carbon 

imposed a low oxygen fugacity in the system and olivine melted incongruently, 

producing olivine with lower Fe content, pyroxene, carbide and carbonate melt.  

Pyroxene also reacted with spinel and produced garnet.  In the run products from the 

experiments with diamond, two distinct occurrences of melt were observed, one in the 

triple junctions along the edge of the fragment, and the other in whiskers located within 

the diamond aggregate.  Apparently, the melt, which produced the whiskers, was 

transported from the fragment in response to the pressure gradients resulting from the 

high strength of the diamond aggregate.  In the experiments with graphite, pockets of 

6

 

 

 

quenched melt were located near the interface between the fragment and graphite.  The 

chemical reaction, occurred at 6 GPa and 1400

  These results are consistent with earlier studies which showed that in the pressure and 

temperature range of our experiments under 

–saturated conditions,  CO  would react 

2CO

with forsterite to produce enstatite and magnesite (Katsura 1990; Koziol 1998; Newton 

1975).  If enough  CO  is supplied, olivine should completely decompose.

In our experiments, only a very small amount of olivine was decomposed, indicating 

thus that the cold sealing of the capsules employed in our experiments was sufficient to 

provide a closed system.  The redox conditions, applied during the experiments, were 

determined by the buffering effects of olivine, graphite, and diamond.  It has been 

proposed that C-O fluids in equilibrium with elemental carbon buffer the oxidation state 

of the earth's upper mantle (French 1966; Sato 1978).  The observed higher percentage of 

melt in the experiments with diamond could be the effect of more oxygen in the air 

trapped among the diamond grains; therefore, we consider the conditions of graphite 

experiments are relevant to the mantle. 

  The quantity of melt (

FeCO

+

CFe3

3

) produced in our experiments with diamond at 6 

GPa was estimated to be equivalent to 3.0 volume % of the original fragment, using the 

largest observed change in the Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratio of olivine and the proposed chemical 

reaction in the calculations.  The approximate volume ratio between the carbonate melt 

and the carbide melt is 2 to 1.  At higher pressures, 10 and 12 GPa only 

FeCO

should be 

3

present as melt, while 

Fe

C3

 or 

Fe

7C

 would occur in the melt as crystals.  Using the 

same method, the calculated amount of melt in the experiments with graphite would be 

around 0.5 volume %. 

 

In the presence of carbon as carbonate melt, olivine in the mantle should have a lower 

Fe/(Fe+Mg) atomic ratio than the San Carlos olivine, as indicated by our experiments.  

This prediction is consistent with observations.  In the melting of the primitive aphanitic 

kimberlite (JD 69), 5.5-7.5 mol % of 

Fe

 was reported in olivine (Wang 1999).  

2SiO

These values are also in agreement with the 7-8% in olivine found as inclusions in 

 

7

diamonds and in xenoliths from kimberlite (Meyer 1972).  Based on the Fe content of 

olivine observed as inclusions in diamonds, about one percent of melt can be expected in 

the upper mantle. 

  The presence of carbonate melt modifies the subsolidus phase relations for 

2 SiO)Fe,Mg(

4

.  Using the Fe/(Fe+Mg) atomic ratios observed in kimberlites and 

diamond inclusions the solidus of olivine coexisting with carbon is given in Fig. 5.  In 

regions where carbonate melt is present in the mantle, the carbonate solidus should be 

used for the mantle instead of the silicate solidus.  A temperature-pressure phase diagram 

for a mantle with the composition  (

SiO)

 is shown in Fig. 6.  This solidus 

suggests that carbonate melt should be present in the upper mantle down to the transition 

zone, and perhaps even deeper than 660 km.  Carbonate melts could separate through 

geological times and become trapped in higher concentrations at the bottom of the 

lithosphere and perhaps at the bottom of the 660 km boundary, as suggested by the 

observed seismic wave velocity attenuation. 

  The existence of carbonate melt in the mantle is supported by the line of direct and 

indirect evidences (Green 1988; Harmer 1998; Hauri 1993; Rudnick 1993; Yaxley 1991).  

While the presence of the carbonate melt in the mantle has not been questioned, its origin 

is still debated.  The incongruent melting of olivine occurring in the presence of carbon, 

as detected in our experiments, offers a plausible explanation for the origin of the 

carbonate melt in the mantle.  Carbon is known to exist in the mantle as graphite or 

diamond, which shows that free carbon still available after the production of carbonate 

melt.  Thus the amount of carbon is/was sufficient to produce the proportion of the 

carbonate melt observed in our experiments.

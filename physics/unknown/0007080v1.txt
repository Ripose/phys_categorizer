running  along  the  symmetry  axis  of  the  cavity  and  thus 
forming several accelerating gaps.   
 
Different  designs  of 
the  spiral  arms  are  possible, 
depending  on  the  required  resonance  frequency.  With 
Splitring structures resonance frequencies of up to XXX 
MHz  can  be  achieved,  whereas  archimedic  type  spirals 
find their application at resonance frequencies as low as 
27 MHz. 
 
1.2 Characteristic Parameters 
 
The  transittime  factor  T  indicates  the  flexibility  of  an 
accelerator as the quotient of the effectively experienced 
voltage and the total gap voltage. The Rp-value is defined 
as the effective cavity voltage squared over the power P 
put into the cavity.

With n as the number of gaps, the Rp-value is proportional

The  wide  spectrum  of  possible  applications  is  clearly

to a narrow energy interval, a 2- or 3-gap accelerator can 
handle  even  particles  with  a  large  deviation  from  the 
design  energy.  This  flexibility  is  characteristic  for  all  of

Abstract 
 
A  focus  of  work  at  IAP  has  been  the  development  and 
optimization of spiral loaded cavities since the 1970s [A. 
Schempp  et  al,  NIM  135,  409  (1976)].  These  cavities 
feature  a  high  efficiency,  a  compact  design  and  a  big 
variety of possible fields of application.  
 
They  find  use  both  as  bunchers  and  post  accelerators  to 
vary the final energy of the beam. In comparison to other 
available designs, the advantage of these structures lies in 
their small size. Furthermore they can easily be tuned to 
the required resonance frequency by varying the length of 
the  spiral.  Due  to  the  small  size  of  the  cavities  the 
required budget can also be kept low. 
 
Here, two slightly different types of spiral loaded cavities, 
which were built for the REX-ISOLDE project at CERN 
and  the  intensity  upgrade  program  at  GSI  are  being 
discussed. 
 

1 COMMON FEATURES 

 
1.1 General Remarks 
 
Large Accelerator facilities very often need to be highly 
flexible  in  terms  of  final  energy  and  the  particles  to  be 
accelerated. With long linear accelerators – like  Alvarez 
or  Wideröe  structures  –  alone,  the  necessary  energy 
variations cannot be attained. Therefore, single resonators 
are  very  often  used.  They  allow  changing  the  energy  of 
the  particles  as  well  as  the  velocity  distribution  of  the 
beam.

Even though an 108 MHz Rebuncher was already present 
in  the  section  in  front  of  the  Alvarez-linac,  it  was 
necessary 
longitudinal  defocusing 
effects.  
The resonance frequency was chosen to be 36 MHz, like 
the  frequency  in  the  HSI,  providing  a  larger  region  of  
linear forces.

This  low  frequency  and  the  limited  space  available 
required  a  compact  structure.  Two  spirals  with  constant 
pitch ("archimedic type")  were chosen, shown in Fig. 5. 
Mechanical stability was guaranteed by fixing each spiral 
with two additional copper tubes on each side.

The  resonance  frequency  of  the  structures  can  also  be 
determined  from  the  geometrical  dimensions  alone  [2]. 
Without going into the details, it should be mentioned that 
it  is  possible  to  describe  a  spiral  loaded  cavity  as  a 
transission  line  loaded  with  capacitors  or  as  a  set  of 
capacitors  and  inductors.  Their  values  can  be  calculated 
analytically  with  a  high  accuracy.  Fig.  3  shows  the 
calculated  capacity  C  at  each  mm  of  the  36  MHz  11.4 
MeV/u spiral in the transfer channel at GSI.

In  addition  to  these  analytical  calculations,  all  of  the 
above  parameters,  the  quality  factor  Q  and  the  shunt 
impedance  η  are  determined  with  the  MAFIA  program. 
Using the obtained field distributions, optimisation of the 
structures is done. 
 

2  THE INTENSITY UPGRADE 

PROGRAM AT GSI 

 
It is the goal of the intensity upgrade program at GSI to 
fill  the  SIS  up  to  its  space  charge  limit.  This  requires  a 
beam current of up to 15 emA (238U4+), which could not 
be  delivered  by  the  earlier  system.  Therefore  the  old 
wideroe  structure  was  replaced  by  an  RFQ  and  two  IH-
structures,  especially  designed 
to  accelerate  high 
intensity, low charge state  beams.  
Special  attention  had  to  be    paid  in  the  two  stripping 
sections, where high space charge effects are present and 
focussing  elements  in  both  transverse  and  longitudinal 
direction are necessary. 

 

Figure 6: distribution of electric field along axis 

 

A  number  of  simulations  was  done  to  optimise  the 
particle motion through the buncher [2,3]; always taking 
into  account  the  various  kinds  of  different  ions  that  are 
going to be used at GSI. 
 
Fig 6 shows the distribution of the electric field along the 
beam axis. Since the gap in the middle of the structure is 
as  wide  as  the  outer  ones,  its  field  shows  double  the 
amplitude. 
Both  resonators  are  already  integrated  into  the  GSI 
beamline and are successfully operated. 
 

3 REBUNCHER FOR REX-ISOLDE 

(Radioactive  Beam  Experiment 

 
at 
REX-ISOLDE 
ISOLDE)  is  a  new  project  at  the  online  mass  separator 
ISOLDE / CERN [4]. 
The structure of exotic and neutron rich nuclei, especially 
Na,  Mg,  K  and  Ca,  will  be  studied.  The  nuclei  have  to 
reach energies in the order of the coulomb barrier. 
By measuring the arising γ-rays both, static and dynamic 
properties of these hardly known nuclei can be examined.

For  the  rebunching  cavities  0-  and  π-mode  have  to  be 
separated. Furthermore, the electric field must be kept in 
reasonable  dimensions  in  order  to  avoid  sparking.  The 
calculated  temperature  distribution  indicates  whether 
additional cooling  is  necessary.  An effective power of 2 
kW is put into the structure, that is working successfully, 
too.

Munich and also operated successfully.

In  order  to  accelerate  the  radioactive  beam  to  the 
necessary  energy,  a  combination  of  an  ion  source, 
penning  trap,  charge  state  breeder,  an  RFQ,  an  IH-
structure and a 7-gap resonator is used. The longitudinal 
match is achieved by inserting a rebuncher between RFQ 
and IH.  
Short  cavities  allow  an  energy  variation  between  
0.8 MeV/u - 2.2 MeV/u.

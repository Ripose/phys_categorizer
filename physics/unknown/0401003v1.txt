Accurate  knowledge  of  absorption  coefficient  of  a  sample  is  a  prerequisite  for 

measuring the third order optical nonlinearity of materials, which can be a serious 

limitation for unknown samples. We introduce a method, which measures both the 

absorption coefficient and the third order optical nonlinearity of materials with high 

sensitivity in a single experimental arrangement. We use a dual-beam pump-probe 

experiment  and  conventional  single-beam  z-scan  under  different  conditions  to 

achieve  this  goal.    We  also  demonstrate  a  counterintuitive  coupling  of  the  non-

interacting probe-beam with the pump-beam in pump-probe z-scan experiment.

Introduction 

Development of high power laser sources has motivated an extensive research in 
the study of nonlinear optical properties and optical limiting behavior of materials.  There 
exits a continued effort in making sensitive measurements on absorption coefficient and 
nonlinear  coefficients,  however,  most  of  the  experimental  techniques  are  focused  on 
measuring  one  or  the  other  of  these  two  important  parameters.    A  variety  of 
interferometric methods1,2, degenerate four wave mixing3 , nearly degenerate three wave 
mixing4 and beam distortion measurement5, have been used for measuring the nonlinear 
refractive index.  One of the most important techniques to measure nonlinear refractive 
index  was  shown  by  Sheik  Bahaei  et  al.6  This  technique  is  simple  and  versatile  yet  is 
highly  sensitive.  However,  an  accurate  knowledge  of  absorption  coefficient  (α0)  is 
necessary  for  the  use  of  this  technique,  which  is  a  serious  limitation  for  unknown 
samples.  An easy way to measure α0 is to use the Beer’s law7-8, which operates in the 
linear  absorption  regime  and  has  limited  sensitivity.  More  sensitive  methods  have  been 
developed,  of  which  the  technique9-15  using  thermal  lens  (TL)  effect  is  perhaps  the 
simplest  and  the  most  effective.  In  this  method,  a  lens  focuses  the  laser  beam  into  the 
sample  resulting  in  a  temperature  gradient,  which  in  turn  produces  a  spatial  gradient  in 
refractive  index.  The  relative  change  in  transmittance  of  the  laser  beam  can  then  be 
measured, after passing through an aperture, with the help of a detector9-11. Shen et al.12-14 
introduced  a  pump  probe  laser  scheme  under  mode-mismatched  and  mode-matched 
conditions to improve sensitivity of the TL method. More recently, Marcano et. al.15 have 
used this method to measure the absorption coefficient of water with high accuracy.

A single experimental technique to measure both the parameters, however, is yet 
to emerge, which could be of significance in the study of new materials.  In this paper we 
introduce a single experimental technique to measure both the parameters.  Our aim has 
been to measure the absorption coefficient (α0) as well as the real and imaginary parts of 
third-order optical nonlinearity (
) with high sensitivity in a transparent sample using 
a single experimental setup. We also show how mid-IR absorption in water (at 1560nm) 
manifests itself as a minute nonlinear absorption coefficient in the near-IR transmission 
window (at 780nm).  Such high sensitive experiments have become possible due to the 
ultrahigh  sensitivity  provided  by  a  stable  ultrafast  laser  operating  at  both  the  above 
wavelengths. 
 
Our technique is a modification of the well-known z-scan technique introduced by 
Shiek Bahaei et. al6 in 1990, where one measures the change in transmittance of a focused 
laser beam through sample that is being moved through the focal point of the lens.   Since 
we are dealing with Gaussian optics when the beam is passing through lens and sample, 
we  will  use  the  Gaussian  optics  formalism.  Subsequently,  we  will  discuss  the  z-scan 
theory and finally we will discuss the modifications that we have introduced in addition 
to the new experimental results and discussions.

Background 

a.  The Gaussian beam in a homogeneous medium 

In most laser application it is necessary to focus, modify or shape the laser beam 
by using lenses or other optical components. In general, laser beam propagation can be 
approximated  by  assuming  that  the  laser  beam  has  an  ideal  Gaussian  intensity  profile 
corresponding  to  TEM00  mode.  Using  Maxwell  equation  in  an  isotropic,  charge  free 
medium one can derive the wave equation16,17:

                                                             (1)

If this equation is to hold true for all r, then the coefficients of different powers of r must 
be equal to zero, which leads to: 

                                                               (6) 

For solving this differential equation we introduce a function S(z), such that 

Q k

                                  (7)

We are using a lens with focal length f=75cm and w01=2.77 mm (which is measured by 
integrating the residual intensity that is measured by translating a knife edge across the 
beam (Fig. 2).  With this background on Gaussian optics, we now discuss the technique 
of Sheik Bahei et. al. 6 in the following section.  
 

b.  The Z-scan technique 

The technique introduced by Bahaei et. al6 is now popularly known as the z-scan 
technique18 as it involves the motion of the sample in the sample across the focal point of 
laser  beam  along  the  direction  of  propagation  of  the  laser  beam  (Fig.  3).    Assuming 

Gaussian  beam  optics  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  this  experiment  allows  an 
intensity scan of the irradiated sample, and provides information about the nonlinearity in 
the sample.  The typical z-scan is performed by translating the sample along the z axis 
from one side of the focus to the other (fig.3).  This results in changing the spot size of 
the incident beam on the sample to a minimum at the focus and then increasing again on 
crossing  the  focus.  Correspondingly,  the  intensity  of  incident  light  increases  on 
approaching the focus till a maximum at the focus is reached and then reduces on moving 
away  from  the  focus.    Thus,  the  overall  purpose  of  the  experiment  is  to  determine  the 
variation in transmission as the incident intensity changes by translation along the z-axis.  
The change in the transmittance of the focusing Gaussian beam in a medium is recorded 
as a function of position of medium.  The transmitted beam is collected either completely 
(which  is  called  the  open  aperture  case)  or  through  a  finite  aperture  (A)  as  shown  in 
Fig.3.   
 
Let  us  first  discuss  schematically,  a  simple  case  of  a  thin  sample  with  negative 
nonlinear refractive index when the aperture is closed (A=0.5, which means just 50% of 
the beam passes through the aperture). When it moves in the z direction it can act as a 
thin lens with variable focal length. If we start the scan from –z (far from focal length), 
where the nonlinear refraction is negligible, the transmittance remains relatively constant. 
As the sample moves closer to the focus, the beam irradiance increases because of self-
focusing of the beam will tend to collimate the beam and cause a beam narrowing at the 
aperture which results in an increase in the measured transmittance (fig. 4a). As the scan 
continues and sample passes the focal plane, the self-defocusing phenomena will occur. 
This will broaden the beam at the aperture and a corresponding decrease in transmittance 
will continue until the sample reaches +z (that is sufficiently far from focus) such that the 
transmittance becomes linear.   

 
If we open the aperture (A=1) and do the same scan again from –z direction, the 
transmittance will increase till focal point and as discussed above, it will decrease to the 
linear case when the sample moves away from focal point to the +z direction (Fig.4c).  

 
Thus,  the  open  aperture  case  scan  gives  information  on  purely  absorption 
nonlinearity  while  a  close  aperture  case  scan  contains  information  about  the  absorption 
and dispersion nonlinearity.  In case of materials with positive refractive index the story 
is  the  reverse  of  the  above  cases  (Fig.4b  and  Fig.4d).    Induced  beam  focusing  and 
defocusing of this type have been observed during nonlinear refractive measurement of 
some semiconductors10,11.   

 
Let  us  now  consider  the  above  qualitative  discussion  mathematically.    We 

consider a sample with third order nonlinearity where the index of refraction is equal to:

Since our sample is thin we can approximate the Gaussian beam is parallel inside 
the sample. We want to calculate the phase shift of the beam when it passes through the 
sample.  The  amplitude 
I   and  phase  of  electric  field  in  the  slowly  varying  envelop 
approximation  as  a  function  of  z′   (propagation  depth  in  the sample),  are  given  by  two

function of stage z and radial variation of incident beam.

only and that no absorptive nonlinearity effects that arise from multiphoton or saturation 
absorption exist. Multiphoton absorption suppress the peak and enhance the valley, while 
saturation produce the opposite effect6,9.   
 

c.  The Dual-Beam technique 

Shen  et  al.12-14  introduced  a  pump  probe  laser  scheme  under  mode-mismatched 
and mode-matched conditions to make sensitive TL measurements.  In such dual beams 
experiments, one of laser beams is essentially probing the effect of the TL caused by the 
pump beam by scanning across its focus.  This results in an effective z-scan of the probe 
beam across a TL generated by a focusing pump beam.  The closed aperture case of this 
scenario  is  shown  schematically  in  Fig.5  which  has  been  used  by  Marcano  et.  al.15  to 
measure the absorption coefficient of water with high accuracy.   

 
Mathematically, as in Ref. [15], we can also use the expression of Shen et. al.12-14, 
who  have  derived  an  expression  for  the  TL  signal  using  diffraction  approximation  for 
Gaussian beams in steady state case as:

We  explore  the  open-aperture  dual  beam  TL  experiments  and  achieve  our  single 
experimental setup to achieve high sensitive measurements.

Present Work 

oP

Our  experiments  are  variation  from  the  conventional  z-scan  discussed  in  the 
above section.  We not only use the single beam technique as mentioned in the previous 
section,  but  with  very  simple  changes  in  the  experimental  set-up,  make  measurements 
corresponding to the dual beam z-scan experiments.  We will now concentrate more on 
our actual experimental scheme and the results and discussions arising thereafter. 
 

a.  Experiment 

Our experimental scheme involves a sub-100 femtosecond mode-locked Er:doped 
fiber  laser  (IMRA  Inc.)  operating  at  a  repetition  rate  of  50MHz  and  provides  the 
fundamental (1560nm) and its second-harmonic wavelength (780nm) simultaneously as a 
single output.  The pulse characteristics of the laser pulses are shown in Fig.6.  Either we 
use both the wavelengths from the laser simultaneously or separate the two copropagating 
beams with the help of a dichroic beamsplitter and use each of them independently.  We 
scan the sample through the focal point of a 75cm focusing lens and this allows a smooth 
intensity scan for either/or both of the wavelengths.  Care has been taken to make sure 
that  there  is  no  effect  of  the  laser  beams  on  the  cuvette  alone  by  conducting  an  empty 
cuvette  experiment.    A  silicon  photodetector  (Thorlab:  DET210)  is  used  for  the  780nm 
beam detection, while an InGaAs photodetector (Acton Research) is used for the 1560nm 
beam detection. 
 

We find that the 1560nm beam produces changes in the relative transmission of 
the  laser  beam  at  different  intensities  as  the  sample  is  scanned  through  the  lens  focus 
depending  whether  we  collect  all  the  light  or  only  central  40%  of  the  transmitted  light 
(Fig.7). These results in Fig.7 essentially represent the z-scan technique of Sheik Bahaei 
et  al.6  to  measure  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  third-order  optical  nonlinearity 
)3(χ
(
).  However, the 780nm beam does not produce any effect even at our peak powers 
at  the  focal  point  of  the  laser  as  is  expected  from  negligible  absorption  at  780nm  (Fig. 
7c).  This enables us to use the 780nm wavelength as the non-interacting probe beam for 
the subsequent dual-beam experiments where we use both the wavelengths from the laser 
simultaneously.  Since our 75cm lens focuses the 780nm probe beam to its minimal spot 
size  position  0.4mm  ahead  of  the  pump  beam  of  1560nm,  this  is  a  mode-mismatched 
pump-probe  experiment.    However,  the  focal  spot  size  of  9µm  for  780nm  is  15µm 
smaller than the corresponding 1560nm spot size at its own focus and from Eq.(24) the 
Rayleigh range for 780nm is 0.32mm and for 1560mm it is 1.15mm.  Thus, the 780nm 
laser  volume  is  always  confined  within  the  1560nm  laser  beam  volume  when  both  the 
beams are used simultaneously from the laser and can act as an effective probe.   

b.  Results and Discussion 

Fig.8 shows the results of the experiment when we collect the 780nm probe beam 
only by separating the 1560nm pump beam after passing through the sample at different 
intensities as the sample is scanned through the lens focus depending whether we collect 
all the light or only central 40% of the transmitted light.  Fig.8a shows the case when the 
entire transmitted probe (780nm) beam is being collected and this essentially depicts the 
saturation  environment  created  by  the  pump  (1560nm)  beam.    This  statement  is  further 
reinforced by Fig.8b, where the case of 1560nm beam alone from Fig.7a is plotted along 
with the results in Fig.8a.  Essentially, as the 1560nm beam starts to saturate the sample 
at its focal point, the 780nm beam also experiences a saturated environment, whereby its 
transmittance  increases  at  its  focal  point  and  shows  an  identical  transmission  behavior 
although the signal level is two orders of magnitude lower.  Such a result indicates the 
thermal  capacity  of  water  that  can  affect  the  spectroscopic  behavior  of  water.    Finally, 
Fig.8c  represents  the  thermal  lens  effect  of  the  pump  beam  resulting  in  a  temperature 
gradient, which in turn produces a spatial gradient in refractive index which is depicted in 
the relative change in transmittance of the probe beam.  Such thermal lensing (TL) effect 
can  be  used  to  determine  the  absorption  coefficient  (α0)  of  the  sample  at  the  pump 
wavelength very accurately15.

The solid line in the fig.8c is the result of a theoretical fit to Eq.(36). This fit gives 
the  value  of  phase  shift,  θ  =  9.957,  which  when  substituted  in  Eq.(37)  with  the 
20,  we 
parameters 
=κ
get the calculated value for α0 as 10.6327cm-1 for the 1560nm beam which is within 1% 
of  reported  literature  data21.    While  this  fairly  large  value  of α0  need  not  be  measured 
with  such  a  sensitive  technique,  it  serves  as  the  proof-of-principle  for  the  experimental 
setup and the accuracy of the experimental measurements.

In Fig.5b, the valley-peak structure representing the 40% closed-aperture data for 
1560nm suggests a self-focusing effect inside the sample.  The Ryleigh range (Z(r)) for 
1560mm is 1.15mm.  From fig. 5b, valley to peak separation at 1560nm is 4mm, which is 
3.4×Z(r) indicating that all the effects at 1560nm are thermal in nature24.  So we use the 
Gaussian Decomposition method to fit this closed aperture z-scan data quite convincingly 
(fig.  5b,  solid  line  fit  to  the  raw  data),  and  we  obtain  γ=1.57×  10-3  cm2  /GW,  which  is 
proportional to n2=4.9×10-12 esu.  Thus α0, β and n2 values of the water sample at 1560nm 
wavelength are determined. 

 
Finally, we use the theoretical expression for the thermal lens of the pump beam 
given  by  Eq.(38)  to  fit  the  experimental  data  (Fig.6a)  of  the  probe  beam  in  case  of  the 
dual  beam  experiment.    The  solid  line  in  fig.6a  is  the  theoretical  fit  and  results  in  a 
calculated parameter β = −8.5×10-3  cm/GW, which is extremely small and indicates the 
high sensitivity of our experiments.  This indicates the very small induced effect in the 
probe  beam  of  780nm  by  the  presence  of  the  pump  beam  of  1560nm  causing  thermal 
lens.  Thus, this technique measures the nonlinear absorption coefficient of materials at 
wavelengths with negligible linear absorption.

Radiation  loss  and  resonant  frequency  shift  due  to  sidewall  surface  roughness  of  circular  and  square  high-contrast 
microcavities  are  estimated  and  compared  by  using  a  boundary  integral  equations  method.    An  effect  of  various 
harmonic  components  of  the  contour  perturbation  on  the  Whispering-Gallery  (WG)  modes  in  the  circular  microdisk 
and WG-like modes in the square microcavity is demonstrated. In both cases, contour deformations that are matched to 
the mode  field  pattern  cause  the  most  significant frequency detuning and  Q-factor  change. Favorably  mode-matched 
deformations have been found, enabling one to manipulate the Q-factors of the microcavity modes.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

High-index contrast optical microcavities of various shapes 
are  versatile  functional  elements  for  dense  wavelength-
division  multiplexing applications [1-7]. One of their  most 
attractive  features  is  the  high  quality  factors  theoretically 
achievable 
in  very  compact  microcavity  designs.  In 
practice,  however,  the  quality  factors  are  limited  by 
fabrication  imperfections  and  often  are  much  lower  than 
their predicted values [7].  A  dominant  loss  mechanism  in 
semiconductor microcavities is the surface roughness [2, 8], 
which  causes  scattering  of  the  energy  of  the  microcavity 
modes and spoils their Q-factors. Thus, to realize high-Q’s 
in  microcavities  it  is  crucial  to  achieve  high-accuracy 
to  produce  smooth  and  vertical 
etching 
sidewalls [8] as well as to develop analytical or numerical 
methods  to  estimate  radiation  loss  and  loss-limited  Q-
factors.  

techniques 

Surprisingly,  despite  the  importance  of  modeling  the 
the  microcavity 
effect  of  sidewall 
imperfections  on 
performance,  few  results  have  been  published,  most  of 
them for circular microdisks operating on their WG-modes 
[9-12] and  spherical  microparticles  [13]. Recently, square-
shaped  microcavities  have  attracted  much  attention  [3-6]. 
Intense directional light emission observed in such cavities 
[6] and their potential for reducing the  modal  mismatch at 
the straight-waveguide-to-microcavity junction [4, 5] make 
them  promising  candidates  as  filters  and  laser  resonators. 
There  is  still  a  need  to  study  the  effect  of  the  surface 
roughness on the modes of square microcavities as well as 
discover  and  examine  general  principles  of  the  scattering 
loss mechanism and frequency detuning of various types of 
modes in arbitrary-shape cavities. 

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  study  how  the  depth  and 
correlation  length  of  the  surface  perturbations  affect  the 
natural  frequencies  and  Q-factors  of  the  modes  in  circular 
and  square  microcavities  and  identify  the  differences  and

common  features  of  the  radiation  loss  and  resonant 
frequency  detuning  mechanisms.  The  Muller  boundary 
integral  equation  (MBIE)  method  [14]  is  chosen  as  the 
simulation 
its  high  speed,  controlled 
accuracy,  and  flexibility  to  model  arbitrary-shape  smooth 
contours.  The  method  demonstrates  superior  accuracy  to 
the  popular  FDTD  techniques  and  local-basis  Galerkin 
algorithms.  We  use  the  effective-index  approach  [14]  to 
reduce  an  original  three-dimensional  (3-D)  problem  of  a 
microdisk to an equivalent 2-D formulation. In wavelength-
scale  thin  microdisks  fundamental  TE-like  modes  (no 
magnetic  field  variation  in  the  vertical  direction;  electric 
field  in  the  disk  plane)  are  dominant  [1],  and  thus  we 
consider only such modes in the following analysis. 

II.  HIGH-Q NATURAL MODES OF CIRCULAR 

AND SQUARE MICRODISKS 

In circular microdisks, the modes demonstrating the highest 
Q-factors are the Whispering-Gallery modes, with the light 
circulating around the rim of the cavity trapped by a quasi-
total  internal  reflection  mechanism.  They  are  classified  by 
azimuthal  and  radial  mode  numbers,  WGm,n,  representing 
the  number  of  angular  and  radial  field  variations, 
respectively.  The  modes  with  one  radial  variation  of  the 
vertical  magnetic  field  (WGm,1)  are  dominant,  “true”  WG-
modes  with  the  narrowest  linewidths.  Square  optical 
microcavities support several types of eigenmodes [14], the 
most  interesting  for  practical  applications  in  filters  and 
microlasers being the high-Q WG-like modes [3-6, 14] with 
the field nulls along the diagonals. 

Using  the  MBIE  technique,  we  solve  the  eigenvalue 
problems  for  2-D  circular  and  rounded-corner  square 
microcavities  having  a  diameter  (side  length)  of  1.6  μm, 
and  an  effective  refractive  index  of  nd=2.63.  This  index 
corresponds to the propagation constant of the TE-polarized 
mode  at  1.55  μm  in  a  200  nm-thick  slab  of  GaInAsP 
(n=3.37),  which  is  a  popular  platform  for  semiconductor 

 

microdisk  lasers  [1,  15,  16].  In  the  vicinity  of  the 
spontaneous  emission  peak  of  the  material  at  room 
temperature,  1.55-1.58 μm  [16],  we  find  a  WG5,1-mode  in 
the  circular  resonator  (λ=1.572 μm;  Q=159.7)  and  a  WG-
like mode in the square resonator  (λ=1.503 μm; Q=288.4). 
The  mode  intensity  distributions  (more  precisely  the 
portraits  of 
)  have  been  computed  and  are 
presented in Fig 1.

phenomenon  is  manifested  in  double  resonant  peaks 
observed in the measurements of the laser emission spectra 
[1]  or  microdisk  resonator  filter  response  [18].  The  WG-
like  mode  in  the  square  microcavity  is  a  non-degenerate 
mode  [3],  and  as  Fig.  3  shows,  the  cavity  boundary 
perturbations  only  shift  the  mode  resonant  frequency  and 
change the value of its Q-factor.

In  both  cases,  there  is  a  range  of  the  perturbation 
harmonic  numbers  with  the  most  noticeable  variations  of 
the  cavity  Q-factors  and  wavelengths.  For  the  circular 
microcavity, this range of ν is also where the most efficient 
splitting  of  the  double-degenerate  WG-mode  is  observed. 
This  range  corresponds  to  the  perturbation  harmonics  that 
are  either  favorably  or  unfavorably  matched  to  the  modal 
field  distribution 
the  cavity.  Favorably-matched 
corrugations increase the Q-factors of the modes, while the 
unfavorably-matched ones cause the degradation of the Q-
factors.  Mismatched  contour  corrugations  with  the  values 
of  ν  (Λ)  outside  this  range  (either  smaller  or  larger) 
enhance  cavity  scattering  losses  and  dampen  the  mode  Q-
factors.

The  width  of 

the  mode-matched 
perturbations, as well as the behavior of the cavity Q-factor 
within this range, depends on the optical size of the cavity 
and  the  particular  type  of  mode  excited.  For  the  higher-
order modes this range becomes longer and shifts to higher 
values  of  ν  (shorter  Λ).  For  example,  it  has  been  shown

(side length) of 1.6 μm and permittivity ε=6.9169+i10-4. 

III.  THE EFFECT OF THE CAVITY SIDEWALL 

ROUGHNESS 

A. Mode-matched and mismatched perturbations 

To  study  how  sidewall 

imperfections  of  various 
correlation  lengths  affect  the  resonant  frequency  and 
linewidths  of  these  modes,  we  assume  that  an  arbitrary 
contour  perturbation  can  be  decomposed  into  a  periodic 
series of azimuthal harmonics [9]. We can now consider the 
harmonics  separately  and  determine  which  of  them  cause 
the  most  pronounced  frequency  shift  and  Q-factor  change 
of the microcavity modes.

of 
the  perturbation  harmonic  number  ν.  Here, 
the 
characteristic  perturbation amplitude is chosen as δ=8 nm, 
based  on  the  estimates  of  5-10  nm  for  the  mean  surface 
roughness  obtained 
from  high-magnification  SEM 
micrographs and scattering loss measurements [2]. 

WG-modes  in  the  circular  cavity  are  double  degenerate, 
and  as  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  2,  the  microcavity  sidewall 
roughness  causes  splitting  of  this  degeneracy  [17].  In 
practical  realizations  of  circular  disk  microcavities,  this 

 

[12]  that  even  low-amplitude  surface  roughness  with  the 
correlation length Λ= 0.02 (ν=50) led to drastic degradation 
of the Q-factor of the WG82,1 mode of the circular cavity.

Furthermore,  a  similar  grating  effect  has  been  observed 
when studying the influence of the surface perturbations on 
the  Q-factors  of  the  natural  modes  of  3-D  spherical 
particles [13], though the regions of the mode-matched and 
mismatched  perturbations  have  not  been  identified.  There, 
certain  combinations  of  the  perturbation  period  and  the 
mode  number  resulted  in  noticeable  Q-spoiling  of  the 
mode, while others yielded relatively weakly Q-spoiling. 

B. Resonant frequency and Q-factor manipulation 

m2=ν

We can observe that for the circular cavity there is one type 
of  the  most  favorably  mode-matched  perturbation  (shown 
,  which  effectively 
in  the  inset  of  Fig.  2b)  with 
splits  the  degenerate  WG-mode,  enhances  one  of  the  split 
modes,  and  suppresses  the  other  one.  This  type  of  the 
corrugated  microcavity  has  been  previously  proposed  [15] 
and  studied  [16,17],  and  is  called  a  microgear  cavity. 
, all other 
Additionally, perturbation harmonics with 
integers dividing m, and their products split the WG modes 
in more pronounced way than for other values of ν but do 
not enhance either of the modes.  

m=ν

The  rapid  development  of  modern  nanotechnology  calls 
for  new  microcavity  shape  designs  that  enable  one  to 
enhance  the  cavity  lasing  mode.  In  general,  there  is  no  a 
priori knowledge of which type of corrugation is favorably 
matched  to  a  given  mode  type  in  an  arbitrary-shape 

3

microcavity.  Computing  and  plotting  the  values  of  the 
mode Q-factor versus the perturbation period enables us to 
find the deformations that enhance the cavity lasing mode. 
It  should  also  be  noted  here  that  a  deformation  that  is 
favorably matched to the lasing cavity mode is most likely 
unfavorably matched to any neighboring competing modes 
of  different  types,  and  thus  increases  the  lasing  mode 
stability and decreases its threshold.

change (b) versus the perturbation amplitude δ for the two types 
of the favorably matched deformations of the square microcavity 

4=ν  and 
(

). 

Now  we  apply  this  procedure  to  the  square  microcavity 
lasing on its WG-like mode, and observe (see Fig. 3b) two 
types  of  favorably  mode-matched  contour  perturbations 
(shown  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  3b)  suitable  for  low-threshold 
semiconductor  laser  designs.  Fig.  4  shows  the  resonant 
wavelengths (a) and Q-factors (b) of the WG-like modes in 
deformed  square  microcavities  as  a  function  of  the  radial 
depth  of  the  perturbation.  For  the  both  types  of  the 
favorably matched perturbations an increase of the severity 
of  the  deformation  results  in  the  11-38%  increase  of  the 
mode  Q-factor  (Fig.  4b).  As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  5,  the 
better the cavity shape matches the mode pattern, the more 
efficient  Q-factor  manipulation  can  be  achieved  (compare 
to  the  same  results  for  the  deformed  circular  microcavity 
modes [15-17] ).  

It should be noted here that in some cases square cavities 
are formed with convex sides due to a fabrication process. 
E.g.,  the  experiments  with  the  hybrid  glass  square-shaped 
laser  cavities  showed  that  the  cavity  shapes  became 
rounded because of the strong surface tension of the liquid 
during dip  coating  [6]. Our  results show that  such  a shape

to the increased amplitude of the contour perturbations. At

the  Q-factors.  However,  we  can  see  that  the  cavity

Furthermore,  the  same  threshold-like  behavior of  the Q-
factor as a function of the perturbation amplitude has been 
observed in the spherical cavity, for both, the periodical and 
irregular  surface  roughness  (see  Ref  [13],  Figs.  2  and  4). 
There,  the  presence  of  the  surface  perturbations  had 
minimal  effect  on  the  resonance  Q-factor  until  reaching  a 
certain  threshold  value  of  the  perturbation  amplitude, 
beyond  which  the  Q-factor  degraded  rapidly.  This  feature 
of  the  natural  modes  of  dielectric  cavities  makes  possible 
the  experimentally  achieved  high-Q  oscillations,  even 
though  every  fabricated  microcavity  is  slightly  imperfect 
[1, 2, 6, 7].

In  summary,  we  have  shown  that  the  performance  of 
high-index  contrast  microcavities  is  strongly  affected  by 
surface-roughness-induced  radiation  loss,  this  effect  being 
most  pronounced  for  roughness  distributions  that  are 
matched  to  the  modal  field  pattern  in  the  cavity.  A 
possibility  for  mode  Q-factor  manipulation  by  controlling

special  mode-matched

to  be  the  best  mode-matched  deformation  of  the  circular 
cavity  that  enables  one  to  effectively  split  the  double-
degenerate  WGm,1–mode  and  achieve  Q-factor  control.  By 
varying the shape and depth of the boundary perturbations 
of  the  square  microcavity  we  demonstrated  an  increase  of 
the  cavity  Q-factor  by  up  to  38%.  Stability  of  the  mode

[12] and 3-D [13] dielectric resonators.

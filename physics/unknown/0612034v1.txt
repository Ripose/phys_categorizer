Abstract 

Motivated by recent advances in single molecule manipulation techniques that enabled 

several groups to tie knots in individual polymer strands and to monitor their dynamics, 

we have used computer simulations to study “friction knots” joining a pair of polymer 

strands. The key property of a friction knot splicing two ropes is that it becomes jammed 

when the ropes are pulled apart. In contrast, molecular friction knots eventually become 

undone by thermal motion.  We show that depending on the knot type and on the polymer 

structure, a friction knot between polymer strands can be strong (the time τ the knot stays 

tied increases with the force F applied to separate the strands) or weak (τ decreases with 

increasing F). We further present a simple model explaining these behaviors.

Molecular knots tied in individual polymer strands have fascinated researchers 

from many fields, see, e.g.,. 1-11  Recent progress in single molecule manipulation 

techniques (reviewed in) 12-14 has enabled several experimentalists to tie a variety knots in 

single biopolymer strands by using optical tweezers 15, 16. With these techniques, it is 

possible to create individual polymeric structures of complex topology and to study their 

dynamics under mechanical tension. Such structures may prove useful in nanotechnology 

applications. In addition, knotted DNA structures are common in biology; Studies of the 

intra-strand interactions in molecular knots may provide new insights into the molecular 

forces that control the DNA dynamics and the organization of the chromatin fiber3.  

 

Motivated by the experimental advances, this paper discusses the dynamics of 

friction knots formed by a pair of polymer molecules.  Friction knots, such as the square 

knot shown in Fig. 1, are commonly used by sailors and climbers to join two ropes 

together.  [Note that they are not “true knots” in the topological sense]. Pulling at the 

ends of the ropes in Fig. 1 jams the knot so that the ropes remain connected regardless of 

the applied force. An elegant theory exists17, which explains this behavior and shows that 

if the friction coefficient between the ropes exceeds a certain knot dependent critical 

value then the two ropes will not come apart no matter how hard one pulls on them.  This 

theory also explains why a slight modification of the square knot known as granny knot 

(also shown in Fig. 1), will be a very poor way of splicing two ropes that will fail at  a 

low force.  Here, we would like to find out whether similar behavior could be observed 

on a microscopic scale, where ropes are replaced by polymer molecules.     

A friction knot, scaled down to molecular dimensions, will no longer hold 

indefinitely under applied tension. Indeed, the knotted conformations of the two 

2

 

 

molecules shown in Fig. 1 would be thermodynamically unfavorable under an arbitrarily 

low force F as the free energy of the system contains the term  −FR  ( R  being the 

distance vector between the ends of the strands at which the force is applied, see Fig. 1), 

which can decrease indefinitely when the two strands are separated.  Microscopically, 

eventual failure of the knot is caused by thermal fluctuations  – a macroscopic analog of 

this would be to pull on the ropes joined by a knot while shaking them vigorously, which 

would obviously facilitate their separation.    

 Nevertheless, signatures of the knot jamming effect can be found when 

examining the dynamics of molecular knots. To compare the dynamic response of 

macroscopic and microscopic knots to tension, note that the strength of macroscopic 

knots is related to static friction, which impedes relative sliding of the two strands1, 17.  In 

contrast, there is no static friction between molecules. Instead the inter-chain “internal 

friction” is a consequence of the bumpiness of the energy landscape of the interacting 

polymers18.  Two intertwined chains may become trapped in conformations 

corresponding to local energy minima.  The sliding of one relative to the other is then 

accomplished via thermally activated transitions from one local minimum to the next. 

Unless the temperature is zero such transitions will happen even if the force is arbitrarily 

small.   

However just as the static friction force between two ropes joined by a friction 

knot increases with the applied tension17, the barriers to the sliding of one polymer strand 

with respect to the other may increase. We therefore expect that it may take longer to 

unravel a molecular friction knot when the applied tension is higher. We will refer to this 

as “strong knot” behavior as opposed to “weak knots” that untie faster when higher force 

3

 

 

is applied. Strong knots are reminiscent of molecular “catch-bonds” observed in forced 

dissociation of some biomolecular complexes (see, e.g., 19, 20  and refs. therein).   

To test our prediction, we have performed computer experiments examining the 

tension-induced dynamics of various knots tied between two polymer strands. We used a 

polymer model, in which monomers were represented as single beads. The potential 

energy of a strand, as a function of the position ri, i=1, …, N, of each bead, is given by: 

V(r1, r2, …, rN) = Vbond + Vbend+Vnon-bonded 

 

The potential Vbond accounts for the connectivity of the chain and assumes that each bond 

is a stiff harmonic spring,

corresponds to a persistence length of 15 monomers at temperature T=0.4 ε/σ.

The energy Vnon-bonded describes the interaction between pairs of monomers that 

are not covalently bonded. We took this interaction to be purely repulsive:

In addition to interactions among non-bonded monomers within each chain, the same 

pairwise potential was used to describe the interactions between pairs of monomers 

belonging to different chains.    

 

We further assumed that the dynamics of the chains were governed by the

In the beginning of each simulation, we connect the two strands by a square or 

granny knot positioned such that the contour length of the polymer chain between the 

knot and the end of each strand is the same. A force Fp= 4.0 F0 is then applied to the ends 

of one strand and  –Fp to the ends of the other strand, for an initial time of tp = 2000 τ0. 

This force pre-tensions the knot without considerably affecting its initial location relative 

to the ends of each polymer. After preparing the initial state of the knot this way, we start 

simulation at t = 0, with a force F applied to the first bead (i=1) of one chain and the 

5

 

 

opposite force acting on the last bead (i=N) of the other one. We monitor the presence of 

the knot by projecting the polymers’ configuration onto a plane that  is parallel to the 

direction of the force and computing the chain intersections in this plane8. The knot 

disappears when the number of intersections falls below 6. This allows us to measure the 

time τ  before the knot disappears. 

We also monitor the distance R between the monomers at which the force is 

applied.  The observed trajectories R(t) typically display  an initial transient behavior that 

has to do with the particular way the knot is prepared followed by an approximately 

linear increase in the distance R. Discarding the transient part, the average strand 

separation rate,

/dR dt , is a convenient way to describe the knot’s response to a pulling 

force. Typical dynamics of the square knot observed in our simulations are shown in Fig. 

2 (also see the supplementary video files).  

We found that the square knot formed between two identical homopolymer  

strands, (A)88 or (B)88 , is a weak knot, for the particular polymer model we used. Our 

interpretation of this observation is that the energy landscape associated with the 

interaction of two homopolymer strands within our model is not rugged enough to 

produce the expected jamming effect.  

We then achieved a more rugged energy landscape by constructing  

heteropolymers of the form AAA(ABAAA)17. The idea that variable size of monomers 

can result in a bumpier energy landscape can be intuitively understood by considering the 

following experiment the reader can perform with any suitable piece of jewelry: Tie a 

square knot between two strands of beads on a string and then attempt to separate the 

strands by pulling at their ends. The strands tend to snag in configurations that in fact 

6

 

 

correspond to local energy minima. This tendency to snag is higher if the beads are of 

variable size, as compared to equal-size beads.   

Figure 3 shows the average time  (

)Fτ  it took for the two polymer strands 

forming a square knot to become separated in our simulations, as a function of the pulling 

force. When both strands were homopolymers (A88 or B88 ), this time decreased 

monotonically and was approximately inversely proportional to F. However when each 

strand was a heteropolymer AAA(ABAAA)17, the separation time initially decreased and 

then increased with the increasing force thus exhibiting the strong knot behavior at high 

forces.   

Like its macroscopic counterpart, the molecular version of the granny knot fails 

much more easily than the square knot: When the same two heteropolymer strands were 

joined by the granny knot, the time  (

)Fτ first decreased with the increasing force and 

then became nearly force-independent, as also shown in Fig. 3.  

It is reasonable to expect that the slowdown in the untying dynamics of molecular 

friction knots would be more pronounced at low temperatures, when there is less thermal 

motion. Indeed, this is what we see in Fig. 4, which explores the dependence of the mean 

strand separation time (

)Fτ on temperature. 

To rationalize the above findings and to understand how forces can influence the 

knot dynamics, consider the simplest model that relates the effective friction to the 

features of the energy landscape18. Suppose the relative sliding of the two strands can be 

viewed as one-dimensional diffusive motion along the coordinate R; The Brownian 

dynamics along R is described by the stochastic equation

where η is a friction coefficient and

is a random force that satisfies the standard

fluctuation-dissipation relationship. The potential VF(R) is our model for the corrugated 

energy landscape for inter-strand interaction. We will assume it to be periodic, 

FV R

. [A random potential may be a better model; however it will 

not qualitatively change our conclusions]. The effect of the force F is to tilt the overall 

potential,

, and also to change the degree of corrugation of the inter-

strand potential, which is described by the parameter  (

The average velocity of diffusion along R can be evaluated exactly22:

where the result does not depend on x0. The amplitude  (

v F should increase with F to

describe the tendency of the potential to become more corrugated.  For low enough forces 

we can assume this to be a linear function:  (

v F

, where the coupling parameter d

has the units of length.  Depending on the value of d, there are two regimes illustrated in 

Fig. 5a:  

 (1). If

 then the potential

 is barrierless and decreases 

monotonically with F.  In this case the sliding speed

/dR dt  should increase with the 

increasing force and the strand separation time should decrease monotonically. This is the 

weak knot behavior.  

(2) However if  

d

 then the barriers in

 will become higher 

when F is increased. When they are higher than kBT  we expect this to lead to a decrease 

in

/dR dt . This is the strong knot regime. At low forces, evaluating  Eq. 1 analytically to 

1st order in F we see that it approaches the free  drift limit

The average sliding speed

explains the minimum of τ(F) seen in Figs. 3-4.

velocity (normalized by

/F T , the resulting plot will be a universal 

free

curve that does not depend on the temperature. As seen from Fig. 5b, this prediction is 

indeed correct, supporting the validity of the simple one-dimensional model as a 

description of the square knot dynamics.    

 

Maddocks & Keller theory 17predicts that the friction coefficient between two 

ropes must exceed a knot-type dependent critical value for the knot to hold.  Our model’s 

prediction for molecular friction knots is very similar: The value of the coupling 

parameter d/a depends on both the knot type (which determines how the tension in the 

polymer strands is transmitted into the intra-strand effective friction17) and the nature of 

the polymer strands. As noted above, in order for a knot to be strong, this parameter must 

exceed a certain critical value. The weakness of the granny knot and of the square knot 

between two homopolymer strands observed here can be interpreted as a consequence of 

the coupling being too low.

We propose a simple way to put in a common scale the h values of 
researchers  working  in  different  scientific  ISI  fields,  so  that  the 
previsible misuse of this index for inter-areas comparison might be 
prevented, or at least, alleviated.

1. Introduction 

The proposal by Hirsch (2005a,b) of a single index, h, to charac-
terize  the  significance  of  the  scientific  output  of  a  researcher  has 
stirred a wave of comment of planetary proportions, mainly appre-
ciative reactions, such as that of Ball (2005), Bornmann & Daniel 
(2005)  Frangopol  (2005),  and  Imperial  &  Rodríguez-Navarro 
(2005).  The  Hirsch  index  of  a  researcher  is  the  highest  integer h 
such that h among this person's Np papers have collected at least h 
citations,  while  the  remaining  Np-h  papers  have  less  than  h  cita-
tions  each.  Hirsch  convincingly  argues  that  h  is  better  than  any 
other single index that one can reasonably come up with, such as: 
a) total number of papers Np; b) total number of citations, Ctotal; c) 
average  value  of  citations  per  paper,  Ctotal/Np;  d)  number  of  "sig-
nificant papers", i.e. papers with more than a prescribed number p 
of citations; e) number of citations to each of the q most cited pa-
pers (the last two are really two-parameter indices).  

The  question  why  anybody  would  want  to  classify  people  by 
just  a  single  number  is  scarcely  touched  upon,  probably  because 
this author considers it obvious that such a course is inescapable; 
and one can conclude in view of the frenzy that the new index is 
stirring,  that  it  is  just  possible  that  he  might  be  absolutely  right. 
One  can  speculate  that  this  bare-bones,  one-dimensional  way  of 
ranking  scientists  may  not  be  completely  unrelated  with  the  pre-
dominantly  Anglo-Saxon  habitude  of  classifying  base-ball  and 
cricket  players  by  their  batting  average  (see,  for  instance,                       
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average), basketball perform-
ers  (http://www.nba.com/statistics/players/scoring.jsp)  by 
their 
rebounds statistics, and the like. Physicists are particularly fond of 
models involving a minimum of parameters, and this approach is 
well anchored in the celebrated principle of Ockham's razor; how-
ever, one ought to remember in this connection that Nature has no 
obligation to us of being simple, a statement that can be proved by 
the  elementary  realization  that,  were  it  otherwise,  Quantum  Me-
chanics would not be around. 

Single-index evaluation makes citation analysis come to mind, 
where it is barely remembered that Garfield originally defined two 
indices to classify journals, the impact factor and the citation half-
life. Darwinian evolution has primed absolutely the impact factor 
and nobody cares anymore about a journal citation half-life, with 
the resulting emergence as primary sources of scientific results of 
journals  whose  vocation  was  to  carry  weekly  science  news  and 

1 

mild  amusement  (see,  for  instance,  McManus,  1976)  to  the  edu-
cated  person,  and  had  correspondingly  negligible  values  for  the 
cited half-life, and for the degree of consolidation of the scientific 
results  thus  presented.  Many  specialized  journals  catering  to  lim-
ited subsets of workers, whose cited half-life was long, indicating 
that  only  final,  well  analyzed  results  were  to  be  found  in  them, 
have been the losers in this race for the impact factor alone, among 
them many journal sponsored by the learned societies. 

Hirsch  is  careful  to  point  out  the  perils  of  using  simple-
mindedly one single parameter to rank people, particularly if one 
uses it in "life-changing decisions, such as the granting or denying 
of  tenure".    He  warns,  for  instance,  that  a  scientist  whose  papers 
have  many  co-authors  will  be  treated  "overly  kindly"  by  the  h 
index, and he suggests that in fields where papers with many au-
thors are the rule (such as high-energy experimental physics) some 
renormalization may be necessary (Batista et al., 2005). However, 
this  kind  of  data  is  not  directly  available  from  ISI  databases,  so 
one of the appealing features of the h-index, its easy extraction of 
the  ISI  database,  would  be  lost if  one  had  to  spend  time  figuring 
out  how  to  correct  it.  The  same  can  be  said  concerning  self-
citations: Hirsch contends that their effect on the h index is small, 
but the fact that relatively high values of h are, almost invariably, 
associated with long tails of low-citation papers seems to point out 
in the opposite direction. 

 
In spite of all the previous caveats and qualifiers, it should be 
obvious  that  the  h-index  is  going  to  be  used  to  hand  promotions 
and to allocate resources, despite (Ball, 2005) some research man-
agers  pious  declarations  that  they  purposely  "avoid  using  impact 
factors  and  citation  indices".  And  since  the  depths  of  politicians' 
(and  administrators')  "uniquely  simple  personalities"  (Caprara, 
Barbaranelli  &  Zimbardo,  1997)  only  begins  to  be  fathomed,  it 
appears  necessary  to  elaborate  a  bit  on  the  portability  of  the  h-
index across the boundary between different scientific fields, lest it 
be grossly misused by eager specimens of the above sets. 

That the h-index cannot be used off-hand to compare research 
workers of different areas has been pointed out by Hirsch himself, 
by noting that the most highly cited scientists for the period 1983-
2002 in the life sciences had h values that were almost twice those 
of the most cited physicists; and from a list of the 36 inductees in 
the  US  National  Academy  of  Sciences  in  the  biological  and  bio-
medical sciences he extracts the same trend, although perhaps with 
smaller  relative  differences  with  respect  to  the  physical  sciences.  
In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  rational  method  to  account  for  this, 
introducing  a  simple  multiplicative  corrections  to  the  h  index 
which  depend  basically  on  the  ISI  field  the  worker  is  in,  and  to 
some extent, on the number of papers the researcher has published. 
We propose below a list of these normalizing factors, so the cor-
rected h remains relatively simple to obtain. 

2. The distribution function of citations 

The citation distribution function, i.e. the function N(x) giving the 
number of papers which have been cited a total of x times has not 
received much attention in the near past, despite the fact that cita-
tion data has been increasingly used for the evaluation of scientific 
productivity  of  individuals  and  institutions.  Laherrère  &  Sornette 
(1998) studied the citation record of the 1120 most cited physicists 
over the period 1981-1997, in a long paper in which they set out to 
prove that many distributions generally regarded to be adequately 
described  by  a  power  law  were  really  better  described  by  a 
stretched  exponential;  their  paper  also  deals  with  radio  and  light 
emissions  from  galaxies,  oil  reserve  sizes,  urban  agglomeration 
sizes, currency-exchange price variations, species extinction rates, 
earthquake distribution and temperatures at he South Pole over the 

last 400000 years. Instead of searching for the function N(x), they 
ranked the 1120 physicists according to their total number of cita-
tions, and plotted this number of citations, C, vs. rank, k,  in what 
amounts  to  a  Zipf  plot.  They  got  a  good  fit  for the  Zipf  function 
C(k) assuming it to be a stretched exponential

.  Redner  (1998)  attacked  this  problem  by  studying 
with 
several data bases, prominent among them the citation distribution 
of  783,339  papers  published  in  1981,  and  the  corresponding 
6,716,198  citations  to  these  papers  between  1981  and  mid-1997 
(Small  &  Pendlebury,  1997).  Interestingly,  47%  of  these  papers 
were uncited, 76% of them had 7 or fewer citations, and only 1% 
had more than 105 citations. Redner notes that while the curvature 
which can be appreciated for this data in a log-log plot would indi-
cate a distribution for N(x) of the type of  (1), this function is not 
appropriate to adequately fit the large-x data. Instead, he finds that 
a good fit can be obtained for the Zipf function C(k) with a power 
law, 

 
( )C k

k k α−

with an exponent 

1 2α≈

, and for the distribution N(x), with the 

l  form  with  expo

same  functiona
.  Redner  is  careful  to 
warn that in the very large x (or very low rank k) the data is quite 
intractable because it is dominated by fluctuations.

3. Calculation of the h index 

3.1.  Power law distribution 

 

We  assume,  by  analogy  with  Redner  results,  that  the  citation 
distribution  for  an  average  research  worker  in  a  given  field  is 
given by the Zipf function (2), with a negative exponent. Then, 

where Ctotal is the total number of citations and Np the total number 
of papers, of that research worker. From this,  

where  we  assume  that  the  number  of  papers  is  large  compared 
with unity, and where

is the averaged number of citations per paper for that emblematic 
research worker. The h index of that typical worker is given by the 
abscissa of the intersection of the Zipf distribution (2) with the line

. Hence,

It  appears  reasonable  to  assume  for  the  average  worker  in  a 
given  scientific  field  the  world  average  of  citations/paper  which 
corresponds  to  that  particular  field,  and  we  elaborate  on  this  be-
low.  But notice also that the h value depends on the cubic root of 
the  total  number  of  papers  as  well.  Hence  Eq  (7)  permits  easy 
comparison of people whose total number of papers differs by no 
more than about 50%.  

3.2. Stretched exponential distribution 

 

The  stretched  exponential  function  was  originally  used  by 
Hirsh as a model of Zipf function. We show below that in this case 
there  is  a  relationship  between  the  total  number  of  papers,  the 
average number of citations per paper in the area of work, and the 
h factor. The analytic variation of h is more intrincate here than it 
is in the case of a power-law function. We assume 

C k
( )

(8) 

where k0 and η are coefficients to be determined, while β has been 
found  to  be  approximately β  =  0.3  (Laherrère  &  Sornette,  1998; 
Redner, 1998). 

The total number of citations, Ctotal is given by:

In this case we suppose that the total number of papers is large 
enough for us to extend the upper limit of the integral to infinity, 
at the cost of slightly overestimating the total number of citations. 
Under this approximation, the integral can be written analytically 
as:

Hence, the distribution function can be written as:

The distribution function given by equation (8) gives zero cita-
tions only when the rank is infinity. We assume that the least cited 
paper has rank fNp  so that  C(fNp) = 1, from which:

where  f  is  the  fraction  of  papers  which  have  been  cited  at  least

This expression can be treated as a transcendental equation in

The solutions of this equation for x =β η(fNp)β can be obtained 
numerically. However, because the maximum of the function xe-x

In the case of f =1 and β =0.3, it results that χc>4.69. However,  
we have found that computation with χc values smaller than 8 may 
produce considerable numerical errors in the calculation of the η 
parameter. 

Once η  is  known  (which  only  depends  on  Ctotal  and β),  the 
value of h can be determined. The definition of the Hirsch index is 
given by: 
 
( )
h C h

and  then,  using  equation  (11)  and  the  result  of  equation  (13)  we

so that, following a procedure as in Eq (13), a numerical solution 
is obtained for z = β η hβ. 

Although it can be seen that the h index depends both on the 
number of published papers Np and on the average number of cita-
cχ , in the case of the stretched exponential distri-
tions per paper, 
cχ    is  not  easy  to 
bution  the  explicit  dependence of  h  on  Np and 
determine for the whole range of values, and we cannot assume a 
slow variation respect to the number of papers, Np.

The  relative  variation  of  each  fi  and  the  range  of  values  it 
adopts  indicate  that  researchers  in  the  different  fields  follow  dif-
ferent  citing  patterns.  It  is  remarkable  that  those  fields  closely 
associated  with  the  concept  of  "experimental  science"  follow  a 
citing pattern similar to that used by the physicists, although with 
different citing density scales. Those fields which could be loosely 
classified  as  "observational"  ("Space  Sciences",  "Geosciences", 
"Psychiatry/Psychology",  and  to  some  extent,  "Social  Sciences") 
seem  to  follow  a  qualitatively  different  citing  pattern,  with  the 
factor  fi  decreasing  as  the  age  of  the  paper  increases  (between 
2000  and  1998).    The  pattern  of  "Mathematics"  and  "Computer 
Sciences" is more similar to that of the "observational" group than 
it is to the pattern of the "experimental" ones. Mathematics is not 
easy to classify, at any rate: some mathematicians (called "formal-
ists") believe that Mathematics are "created", or "invented" in the 
same sense that Art is, and hence do not have any existence out-
side the human mind, while for other mathematicians, called "pla-
tonists", mathematical truths are external to the human mind, and 
are out there to be "discovered", or "uncovered" (see, for instance, 
Livio,  2003).    The  citation  pattern  of  the  field  "Economics  & 
Business"  (which,  in  principle,  is  an  "observational"  science  or  a 
subset  of  Sociology)  is  not  well  behaved  for  the  purposes  of  this 
paper, and is the only one for which is difficult to postulate a well-
defined normalizing factor.  

 

The  data  reflects  the  average  number  of  citations  (as  of  Dec. 
2005)  a  paper  in  each  field  and  year  of  publication  has  received 
since publication. The value is naturally larger for older papers, but 
a tendency to stabilize is visible in all fields after a few years. The 
average  values  for  each  year  are  strongly  dependent  on  the  field, 
and can vary by a factor as high as 9; thus the quotient between the 
values corresponding to "Molecular Biology & Genetics” and those 
corresponding to "Mathematics" is 8.3 for papers published in 1995 
(we  do  not  consider  here  the  field  labelled  "Multidisciplinary"  by 
ISI).

ltiplied 
mu
in  order  to  put  it  in  the  same  scale  as  that  of  the  field 
"Physics",  as  described  in  Eq. (7).  In  Fig  1  we  can  see  that  after 
about  six 
years,  the  normalizing  factor  fi  for  each  field  becomes 
quite stable; 
a notable exception is the field "Economics & Busi-
ness",
h shows a quite marked descending pattern over the six 
years  shown,  and  to  a  less  extent,  "Mathematics"  and  "Computer 
Sciences", which show a descent with some degree of stabilization 
just in the 1995-1998 interval. A similar pattern can be observed in

We  have  tabulated  in  the  first  column  of  Table II  the  recom-
mended  values  for  normalization  of  the  h  index, computed  under 
the  assumption  that  the  distribution  function  of  the  citations  is 
given by Eq (2). They have been calculated by averaging the ratio 
of  the  number  of  citations/paper  for  each  field,  for  years  1995, 
1996, 1997 and 1998, and normalizing to the corresponding values 
for  the  field  "Physics",  prior  to  applying  Eq.  (18).  Notice  that

papers would require to apply also a correction along the lines of 
Eq. (7).  

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  normalizing  factors  for  the  five 
fields which could be labeled "(molecular) life sciences": "Micro-
biology", "Biology & Biochemistry", "Neuroscience & Behavior", 
"Immunology" and "Molecular Biology & Genetics" (see Table II, 
and  Fig  3)  agree  well  with  Hirsch's  observation  that  h  indices  in 
the life sciences for Nobel prize researchers are about twice those 
in Physics.  

5.2. Stretched exponential distribution 

The  expression  of  the  h-index  in  this  distribution  model  is 
strongly dependent on the number of published papers of a given 
author, and so is, consequently, the correction factor. The last four 
columns  of  Table  II  contain  the  correction  factors  relative  to  the 
field  "Physics"  for  all  fields,  meant  to  compare  h  indices  of  au-
thors  having  100,  200,  500  and  1000  papers.  It  can  be  seen  that 
this model predicts correction factors which are more conservative 
than those of the power law model. It appears that the values pre-
dicted by the stretched exponential model converge to those of the 
power  law  model  in  the  limit  of  an  infinite  number  of  papers. 
Some  caution  must  be  exercised  with  ISI  fields  with  cita-
tions/paper  rates  smaller  than  8.  (Mathematics,  Computer  Sci-
ences,  Engeniering,  Social  Sciences  and  Material  Sciences),  be-
cause the numerical method used to calculate the corrector factor 
may produce some inaccuracies.

law  Zipf  plot  (for  comparison  of  authors  having  different  number  of  pa-
pers,  see  text).  The  remaining  columns  give  correction  factors  computed 
under  the  assumption  that  the  citation  distribution  function  is  a  stretched 
exponential,  for  comparison  of  authors  having  a  similar  number  of  pub-
lished papers.

6. Examples taken from Spanish research workers 

6.1. Power law model 

We have looked up those research workers of Spanish institu-
tions  listed  by  Thomson  ISI  as  "Highly  cited  scientists"  at  URL 
http://portal.isiknowledge.com/portal.cgi?DestApp=HCR&
Func=Frame, (downloaded Feb 21, 2006), with the condition that 
they had not very common last names; excluding commonness of 
last  name  should  introduce  no  bias  in  our  sample  (Hirsch, 
2005a,b),  and  facilitates  unambiguous  identification  of  each 
worker.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  III,  where  we  have 
tabulated the values of h, Np and our corrected (assuming a power 
law distribution) index, H:

The initial range 15-84 in the h values of Spain top-cited sci-
entists  becomes  reasonably  more  homogeneous  after  correction, 
28-65.  The criteria ISI employs to include a scientist in the cate-
gory  of  "Highly  cited  scientist"  are  not  known  in  any  detail,  but 
are certainly dependent on the scientific field. This is particularly 
clear  when  one  looks  at  the  field  "Mathematics",  in  which  four 
Spaniards are included as "highly cited", all having a citation level 
considerably  lower  than  that  present  in  scientists  of  other  fields. 
Still it is puzzling to observe in this connection that A. Wiles is not 
included  in  this  honor  roll,  despite  the  fact  that  he  has  become, 
arguably, one the most celebrated mathematicians of the 20th cen-
tury,  after  his  renowned  proof  of  so-called  Fermat's  last  theorem 
was known (Wiles, 1995)1. In fact, a simple Thomson ISI search 
assigns him a mere h=12 (H=22) on a list of just 13 papers. Since 
it  is  by  no  means  usual  in  other  fields  to  publish  single-author 
papers  109  pages  long  containing  the  work  of  several  years,  it  is 

                                                           
1 Our mention of this paper here does not appear to have a chance of im-
proving the h-value of this author. 

easy  to  see  why  "Mathematics"  is  a  field  that  has  quite  specific 
rules, and probably requires individualized treatment. 
The  results  in  Table  III  also  indicate  that  it  is  unlikely  that  a  re-
search worker will have a relatively high h (or H) value without  
having simultaneously a large number of papers. This could be an 
indication  that  self-citations  play  a  role  in  the  value  of  h  more 
important  than  that  acknowledged  by  Hirsch.  However,  Hirsch's 
argument  that  self-citations  to  papers  having  less  than  h  citations 
are of no effect on the final value of the h index is undeniable, and 
hence some quantitative research would be necessary to clarify the 
influence of the number of self-citations on the h index. 

6.2. Stretched exponential model 

 
In order to illustrate this model we have used the extant infor-
mation  relative  to  number  of  published  papers  and  h-factor  for 
some of the scientists of ICMM-CSIC. The choice has been based 
on our ability to disambiguate data for not so uncommon names on 
the ISI web. Results have been plotted in figure 3 as large dots. In 
this figure, three curves of h vs. Np have been plotted, for χ =12.7, 
11.3 and 7.9, i.e. those values corresponding to Chemistry, Physics 
and Materials Sciences, for the period from 1995 to 1998. It can be 
seen that many of the sampled scientists cluster around the curves 
for Physics and Chemistry, but there are several authors whose 

no  big  difference  between  the  statistics  for  "Physics"  and  that  of 
"Chemistry", but it is clear, after the data in Table II, that a worker 
whose bulk of scientific publications belongs properly in the field 
"Materials  Science",  would  need  to  have  his/her  h-index  multi-
plied  by  some  factor  between  1.29  and  1.36  before  a  meaningful 
comparison can be made with the other two groups.   

 
We believe this adjustment to the h-value is more meaningful 
than that advanced by Hirsh as the m parameter, i.e., our plot de-
tects,  for  different  numbers  of  published  papers,  which  scientists 
clearly deviate from world standards. Thus, a scientist whose rep-
resentative point is close to the world curve for the adequate field 
may be thought of as having a worldwide degree of acceptance by 
his/her  peers,  independently  of  the  number  of  published  papers 
being  high  or  low.  This  provides  a  fair  measure  for  those  people 
who devote only a part of their time to research, and permits one 
to  compare  people  who  differ  in  age.    According  to  the  present 
model, after several years (from 5 to 10) from the first publication, 
the main relevant factors which modify h are the number of cita-
tions/paper  in  the  scientific  area  in  which  the  scientist  publishes 
(which,  presumably,  only  reflects  citation  habitudes  in  that  par-
ticular collective) and the number of published papers. 

 Molecular Biology & Genetics χ = 39.2
 Immunology χ = 30.4
 Neuroscience & Behavior  χ = 26.6
 Microbiology χ = 22.4
 Clinical Medicine χ = 16.9
 Chemistry χ = 12.7
 Physics χ = 11.3 
 Agricultural Sciences χ =  7.9

representative  points  lie  well  above  the  curve,  probably  setting 
them apart from the majority of workers in the Institute.  One can 
speculate that the more the actual h-value of a given scientist devi-
ates  from  the  statistical  estimate  of  his/her  group,  the  higher  the 
merit or excellence of that scientist. But of course, a major prob-
lem that we have ignored so far is that of classifying a scientist's 
production  under  one  or  other  of  the  ISI  headings.  In  the  ICMM 
there  are  workers  whose  papers  could  be  classified  as  "Chemis-
try", "Physics", "Material Science", and mixtures thereof. There is

7. Concluding remarks 

 
We believe the above discussion and data indicate that: 
 

a)  Simple-minded  comparison  of  the  h-index  of  two  people  will 
give meaningless results unless the indices are properly corrected 
for  the  fact  that  different  science  fields  have  different  citation 
habitudes,  as  reflected  in  the  widely  differing  average  values  of 
citations/paper for the different scientific areas. In particular, it is 
quite  obvious  that  an  average  scientist  should  have  a  number  of 
citations/paper similar to the world average in his/her field, since

this will be an indication that this person's papers meet the gener-
ally  accepted  standards  of  the  trade.  It  could  perhaps  be  argued 
that  a  few  highly  cited  scientists  could  disproportionately  inflate 
that statistic, but then one should remember the sobering fact that 
about  47%  of  all  published  papers  go  uncited,  which  makes  this 
distortion extremely improbable. In other words, scientists with a 
χ value (cf. Eq (5)) significantly lower than the world average of 
their  field  are,  in  quite  a  literal  sense,  substandard,  and  the  same 
can be said of entire groups showing this kind of individual behav-
ior. 
 
b) In many cases the h-index must be corrected for the number of 
published papers, an effect shown with different intensity by both 
models  used  in  the  calculation;  it  can  be  said  that,  theoretically, 
any model will show that effect, which is inherent in the Zipf plot. 
It  could  be  objected  that  both,  number  of  papers  and  h  value  are 
independent indicators of a certain degree of accomplishment, so it 
should  not  be  surprising  that  these  numbers  are,  in  a  way,  corre-
lated. But then a high number of papers which is not accompanied 
by  a  correlative  value  of  the  h  value  would  obviously  indicate  a 
low  quality  of  the  scientific  content  of  these  articles;  and,  on  the 
contrary,  a  value  of  the  h-index  higher  than  that  which  could  be 
expected from the number of papers, can be taken as an indication 
of quality when the number of papers is not high, for instance, due 
to partial dedication to scientific duty or young age. 
 
c)  The  model  predicting  a  stronger  influence  of  the  number  of 
published  papers  in  the  h-index  implicitly  predicts  an  important 
influence on that index of the number of self-citations, since a high 
value of this number is unavoidably linked with a high number of 
papers.  Hence,  should  the  future  evidence  favor  Hirsch's  opinion 
that  the  effect  of  self-citation  on  the  h-index  is  negligible,  that 
same  evidence  would  appear  to  favor  the  power-law  model  over 
the stretched exponential model of distribution, since in the former 
one the number of published papers is only weakly linked to the h-
number; otherwise, one would have to conclude that the citations 
(or lack thereof) to papers of a scientist not contributing to the h-
index could have an influence on those papers that do contribute to 
that index.

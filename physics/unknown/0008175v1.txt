Abstract 

The  new  method  to  stabilize  the  beam  energy  of  the 
KEK  40MeV  proton  linac,  is  developed  now.  In  this 
method,  the  signal  of  the  velocity  monitor  installed 
upstream  the  debuncher  in  the  40MeV  beam  line,  is 
processed  and  then  fed  to  the  phase  shifter  of  the 
debuncher rf system so as to cancel the fluctuation of the 
beam energy.   

In  this  article,  the  beam  tests  to  prove  the  validity  of 

this method and the system are described. 

1  INTRODUCTION 

Various improvements to increase the beam intensity of 
the KEK 12GeV PS for neutrino oscillation experiments 
have been continued these several years[1]. Since one of 
the causes that limit the beam intensity is the beam loss in 
the accelerators or the beam lines, the accelerators should 
be  tuned  with  scrupulous  care  and  these  conditions  be 
kept constant during the long operation period. 

One  of  the  beam  parameters  that  affect  the  next 
accelerations  and  the  beam  extractions  is  the  centre 
energy (momentum) of the beam. In order to keep the  

 

 

beam  energy  being  constant  in  the  proton  linac,  the  rf 
system  should  equip  the  feedback  loop  which  stabilizes 
the  accelerating  field.  Unfortunately,  since  the  rf  system 
of our linac is operated near the saturation, the effects of 
the  feedback  are  not  expected  much.  Hence, 
the 
investigation  of  the  new  method  to  stabilize  the  beam 
energy was started. 

2  BEAM TESTS 

2.1  The layout of the linac 

The  KEK  40MeV  proton  linac  that  consists  of  the 
prebuncher,  the  20MeV  tank,  the  40MeV  tank,  the 
debuncher, and the 40MeV beam line is shown in Figure 
1. Two velocity (β) monitors are installed in the 40MeV 
beam  line,  one  (40β1)  is  for  the  detection  of  the  output 
beam of the linac and the other (40β2) is for the beam to 
inject the 500MeV booster synchrotron. The debuncher is 
installed  between  them[2],[3].  The  typical  waveforms  of 
the 20β1, the 40β1 and the 40β2 are shown in Figure 2. 
Figure  3  shows  the  variations  of  the  40β1  and  the  linac 
beam  current  during  the  operation  period  of  about  a 
month.  The  fluctuations  of  the  accelerating  energy  are 
within 0.9%.

2.2  Beam tests 

Figure  4  shows  the  layout  of  the  beam  tests.  The 
velocity monitor signals are acquired by the VME system 
and simultaneously observed by the scope. The debuncher 
rf system, therefore, the phase shifter is controlled by the 
PLC(Programmable Logic Controller).

The  result  of  the  energy  variation  measured  by  40β1 
and 40β2 versus the debuncher phase is shown in Figure 5. 
Though the variation of the momentum spread (∆P/P), it 
is obvious from Figure 5 that it is possible to change the 
beam energy within  ± 300MeV.

 In  order  to  estimate  the  new  method,  we  studied 
whether  it  cancels  the  energy  fluctuations  due  to  the 
accelerating  field  of  the  two  tanks,  namely,  the  20MeV 
tank level, the 40MeV tank level and the phase between 
two tanks. 

Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8 are the results of these 
tests. In these graphs, the 40beta1 is the plots for the linac 
output  energy,  the  40beta2@D.B  ON  for  the  constant 
phase  of  the  debuncher  and  the  40beta2@P.ADJ  for  the 
adjusted phase to cancel the energy fluctuation.

debuncher field. Furthermore, for the stabilization during 
the  pulse  duration  of  the  beam,  the  WE  7000  SYSTEM 
made  by  YOKOGAWA  ELECTRIC  COMPANY  will  be 
introduced as the data acquisition and the control system. 

3  SUMMARY 

It is proved that the new method by using the velocity 
monitors  and  the  debuncher  is  effective  to  stabilize  the 
beam energy. Especially, the energy fluctuation due to the 
20MeV  tank  level,  the  40MeV  tank  level  and  the  phase 
between two tanks are reduced within 0.08%. 

It  is  expected  that  the  new  system  will  be  completed 
immediately  and  then  will  be  used  for  the  normal 
operation of the KEK 12GeV PS.

3  THE SYSTEM PLAN FOR THIS 

METHOD 

In  this  method,  to  stabilize  the  beam  energy,  the 
debuncher  phase  should  be  set  to  the  appropriate  value 
that is caluculated from the signals of the velocity monitor 
and  the  phasing  system  between  the  beam  and  the

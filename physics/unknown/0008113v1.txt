Abstract

The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) is being designed
for  operation  in  2004.    The  SNS  is  a  1  GeV  machine
consisting of a combination normal-conducting and super-
conducting linac as well as a ring and target area.

The  linac  front  end  is  a  402.5  MHz  RFQ  being
developed by Lawrence Berkeley Lab. The DTL (at 402.5
MHz)  and  the  CCL  (at  805  MHz)  stages  are  being
developed  by  Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory.  The
expected output energy of the DTL is 87 MeV and that of
the  CCL  is  185  MeV.    The  RF  control  system  under
development  for  the  linac  is  based  on  the  Low  Energy
Demonstration Accelerator’s (LEDA) control system with
some new features. This paper will discuss the new design
approach  and  its  benefits.  Block  diagrams  and  circuit
specifics  will  be  addressed.  The  normal  conducting  RF
control system will be described in detail with references
to the super-conducting control system where appropriate.

1   RF  CONTROL  FUNCTION

OVERVIEW

The RF system for the SNS linac is well described in
M.  Lynch’s  paper  in  these  proceedings  [Ref.  1].
Specifically  of  interest  to  the  RF  Control  System
(RFCS) is the fact that one control system is required for
each  klystron.  The  RF  control  system  must  support
operation of 402.5 MHz and 805 MHz normal conducting
(NC)  cavities,  as  well  as  805  MHz  superconducting
(SRF)  cavities.    The  intent  of  the  RF  Control  system
design  is  to  provide  a  system  which  requires  minimal
hardware  changes  to  support  all  three  cavity  types.  For
each cavity type, the governing specification is to provide
cavity  field  control  within  ±0.5%  amplitude  and  ±0.5°
phase.

The functions required of the RFCS are:  Cavity Field
Control,  Cavity  Resonance  Control,  HPRF  Protection,
and  Reference  generation  and  distribution.    Figure  1
shows a block diagram of the RFCS. We have selected a
VXIbus architecture for the RFCS.

The present design combines cavity field control and
resonance  control  into  a  single  double-wide  VXIbus
module. The HPRF Protect function will be performed by
another VXIbus module. Both are supported by a Clock
Distribution Module. Physically this design differs from
its predecessor (the Accelerator Production of Tritium RF
control  system)  where  Resonance  Control  and  Field
Control were individual modules and the HPRF Protect

function required a VXI module plus multiple outboard
chassis.  Experience  with  LEDA  has  showed  us  we  can
reduce  the  number  of  channels  supported  by  the  HPRF
Protect circuitry in such a way as to perform all required
functions  in  a  single  VXI  module  only.  We  have  also
seen  that  combining  the  Field  and  Resonance  Control
functions  into  a  single  VXIbus  module  reduces  the
amount of backplane cross-communication and simplifies
module-to-module interconnections.

A conceptual VXIbus crate layout is shown in Figure
2. Due to the physical separation of the klystrons for the
NC cavities, we are only putting one RF Control system
in a VXI crate. The SRF cavities’ klystrons are located
close enough together to encourage savings in crate and
rack cost by co-locating two control systems in a single
crate.  We cannot do this for the NC systems because the
distances  between  adjacent  klystrons  will  detrimentally
affect our control margin due to increased signal group
delay.

Control functions (one each).

2.1  Clock Distribution Module

The Clock Distribution Module (CDM) is quite similar
to  that  of  LEDA.  It  receives  a  phase  stable  reference
signal  from  the  Reference  Distribution  system  and
generates  a  40  MHz  ADC  (analog-to-digital  converter)
clock (digital) and a 50 MHz IF (analog) for use by the
Field/Resonance Control Module. A block diagram of the
CDM is presented in Figure 3.  The CDM also receives
pulse timing information from the Brookhaven National
Laboratory Timing Module and distributes it to the rest of
the RFCS to synchronize the RFCS with the rest of the
accelerator.

2.2  Field/Resonance Control Module

The Field/Resonance Control Module has two primary
functions. 1) It determines the current resonance condition
of the cavity and sends a correction signal to the Cavity
Resonance  Control  System  (water  cooling  for  the  NC
cavities) which brings the cavity back to resonance and
maintains it.  It also generates a frequency-shifted drive for
conditions when the cavity is far off-resonance [Ref 2]). 2)
The module also samples the cavity field and outputs the
correct control signals for the klystron in order to keep the
cavity field phase and amplitude within specification. It
uses  both  PID  (proportional-integral-derivative)  control
and  an  adaptive  feedforward  algorithm.  The  adaptive
feedforward algorithm we refer to as an Iterative Learning
Controller  and  is  covered  in  a  separate  paper  at  these
proceedings [Ref.3].

Figure  4  is  a  simplified  block  diagram  of  the
Field/Resonance  Control  Module.    This  module  makes
extensive  use  of  modern  high-speed  digital  circuitry.
Downconversion  of  the  RF  signals  for  the  resonance
control function and upconversion of the controlled RF
drive signal for the klystron are the only analog circuits
on  the  board.    Significant  digital  components  are  two
digital  signal  processors  (DSPs)  and  four  Complex
Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs).  The two TI C60

The Resonance Control algorithm is the same as used
in LEDA [Ref. 2].  In the fast field control signal path,
multi-rate digital processing is performed in CPLDs for
optimized throughput.  The Field Control DSP performs
the slower, pulse-to-pulse, adaptive feedforward and gain
scheduling features, while the Field Control CPLD does
the actual fast feedback PID algorithm.

We will use the Altera EP20KE series CPLD family.
Three  of  the  four  CPLDs  are  identical,  containing  a
multiplexer/  multiplier  (I/Q  detector),  digital  filter,  2x2
rotation matrix and a PID controller).  The I and Q output
data  rate  is  20  MHz,  and  the  expected  delay/latency
through  the  CPLD  is  23.5  cycles  (1174  ns).    Figure  5
shows a block diagram of the CPLD signal flow and the
associated  delay/latency  at  each  step.    Note  that  the
primary  source  of  delay  is  the  group  delay  through  the
FIR  filter.    The  fourth  CPLD  in  the  Control  Module
includes this basic structure as well as the functionality to
perform klystron phase control.

4  SUMMARY

The design of the RF Control System for the Normal
Conducting  SNS  linac  is  well  underway.    Individual
modules have been identified, specified, and are mostly
through the initial design phase.  In the next few months
we will begin bread-boarding these modules and putting
together an initial test system.

2.3  HPRF Protect Module

The  HPRF  Protect  function  is  fulfilled  by  a  single
VXIbus module. It is based on the HPRF Protect system
for LEDA, which consists of a VXIbus module and four
different chassis.  Based on lessons learned on LEDA, we
have  been  able  to  dramatically  simplify  this  function.
The module’s purpose is to turn off the RF drive to the
klystron should a fault occur within the HPRF transport
line, be it arcing in the waveguide or unexpectedly high
reflected power.  There are six RF channels per module for
monitoring RF power and ten inputs from the fiber optic
arc subsystem for monitoring waveguide arcs.  Instead of
simply turning off the drive to the klystron on any given
fault,  logic  is  built  into  each  channel  to  allow  for  a
certain number of faults within a certain period of time
(fault frequency) before declaring an RF-off state.

Besides  waveguide  arc  monitoring  via  fiber  optic
detectors, logic is built into the module to interpret when
a  cavity  arc  occurs  based  on  RF  power  signal  from
directional  couplers  at  the  cavity  itself  and  the  internal
cavity field.

Like the Field/Resonance Control Module, the HPRF
Protect Module is primarily digital.  The analog front end
consists  of  a  20  MHz  bandwidth  input  filter  at  the  RF
frequency  (402.5  or  805  MHz)  and  a  true  RMS  power
detector (AD8361).  The input filter is the only part that
is  frequency-dependent.    A  six  Ms/s  analog-to-digital
converter (Zilog XRD 6418 with 6 channels used) with
10 bits of resolution is used to digitize the power within
the pulse.  After that, all the comparators are digital, and
with a simple Altera PLD for decode/actions, the expected
total response time is 10 µs. A block diagram of a single
RF channel (which is duplicated six times on the board) is
given in Figure 6.

3  REFERENCE  DISTRIBUTION

The phase stable RF Reference required for the linac
will  be  distributed  via  an  insulated  3  1/8”  coaxial  line
along the tunnel of the accelerator.  The local oscillator
frequency is distributed (352.5 MHz, or 755 MHz) and is
mixed with the cavity field from individual pickup loops
from each cavity in order to send a 50 MHz cavity field
signal  up  to  the  klystron  gallery  where  the  RF  Control
electronics are located. The phase stability of the reference

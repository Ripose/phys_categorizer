Reliability of Fully 3D Monte Carlo 
Reconstruction in SPECT 

D. Lazaro, Z. El Bitar, V. Breton and I. Buvat 

    Abstract—  We 

recently  demonstrated 

the  value  of 
fully  3D  Monte  Carlo 
reconstructing  SPECT  data  with 
reconstruction  (F3DMC),  in  terms  of  spatial  resolution  and 
quantification.  This  was  shown  on  a  small  cubic  phantom  (64 
projections 10 x 10) in some idealistic configurations. The goals of 
the present study were to assess the effect of noise and modeling 
errors  on  the  reliability  of  F3DMC,  to  propose  and  evaluate 
strategies  for  reducing  the  noise  in  the  projector,  and  to 
demonstrate the feasibility of F3DMC for a dataset with realistic 
dimensions.  A  small  cubic  phantom  and  a  realistic  Jaszczak 
phantom dataset were considered. Projections and projectors for 
both phantoms were calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation 
code  GATE.  Projectors  with  different  statistics  were  considered 
and  two  methods  for  reducing  noise  in  the  projector  were 
investigated:  one  based  on  principal  component  analysis  (PCA) 
and  the  other  consisting  in  setting  small  probability  values  to 
zero.  Energy  and  spatial  shifts  in  projection  sampling  with 
respect  to  projector  sampling  were  also  introduced  to  test 
F3DMC  in  realistic  conditions.  Experiments  with  the  cubic 
phantom  showed  the  importance  of  using  simulations  with  high 
statistics  for  calculating  the  projector,  and  the  value  of  filtering 
the  projector  using  a  PCA  approach.  F3DMC  was  shown  to  be 
robust with respect to energy shift and small spatial sampling off-
set  between  the  projector  and  the  projections.  Images  of  the 
Jaszczak  phantom  were  successfully  reconstructed  and  also 
showed  promising  results  in  terms  of  spatial  resolution  recovery 
and quantitative accuracy in small structures. It is concluded that 
the promising results of F3DMC hold on realistic data sets.

modeled  either  using  approximate  analytical  models  [1,2]  or 
using  Monte  Carlo  simulations  [3].  We  recently  revisited  the 
Monte  Carlo  approach  and  demonstrated,  on  a  small  cubic 
phantom,  that fully 3D Monte Carlo (F3DMC) reconstruction 
using a 3D projector estimated by high statistics Monte Carlo 
simulations  was  worthwhile  to  improve  spatial  resolution, 
signal-to-noise ratio and recovery of local tracer concentration 
[4,5]. In the present study, we assessed the effect of noise and 
modeling  errors  on  the  reliability  of  the  reconstruction  for  a 
dataset  of  small  dimensions  hence  easy  to  handle,  and 
compared  two  different  strategies  for  reducing  noise  in  the 
projector.  We  also  showed  the  feasibility  of  F3DMC  on  a 
realistic dataset using a simulation of a Jaszczak-like phantom. 

II.  MATERIAL AND METHODS 

A.  Monte Carlo simulations 
Monte  Carlo  simulations  were  performed  using  the  code 
GATE,  which  has  been  recently  validated  for  various 
configurations  in  SPECT  and  PET  (e.g.,  [6,7]).  Photon 
transport within the collimator was simulated using the Monte 
Carlo  approach,  ensuring  an  accurate  model  of  the  imaging 
system  sensitivity.  No  variance  reduction  techniques  were 
used. 

1)  Simulated configurations 
Two phantoms were considered (Figure 1): 

(cid:1)  a cubic phantom consisting of 3 Tc-99m line sources and 
3 Tc-99m point sources embedded in air, water and bone 
(Fig. 1a). Different activity concentrations were set in the 
point sources and line sources while there was no activity 
in the background, 

(cid:1)  a  10  cm  diameter  cylindrical  phantom  (Fig.  1b),  filled 
with water, including 6 cylinders having diameters of 4.8, 
6.4,  7.8,  9.5,  11.1  and  12.7  mm.  The  smallest  five 
cylinders  were  filled  with  water  whereas  the  biggest  one 
contained bony material. The bony cylinder contained no 
activity.  Tc-99m  activity  (2.08  MBq/ml)  was  set  in  the 
cylindrical  phantom,  while  the  5  water  filled  cylinders 
contained 8.32 MBq/ml of Tc-99m. 

 

 

 

  3.125  mm  ·

The  cubic  and  cylindrical  phantom  volumes  were  sampled 
on a 10· 10· 10 voxel grid (1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm voxels) and on 
a  64· 64· 64  voxel  grid  (3.125  mm  ·
  3.125  mm 
voxels),  respectively.  For  the  cubic  phantom,  64  projections 
10· 10  (pixel  size:  1  cm)  were  simulated  (radius  of  rotation 
R=12 cm). For the cylinder, 64 projections 64· 64 (pixel size: 
3.125  mm)  were  simulated  (R=12  cm).  In  both  cases,  the 
gamma  camera  characteristics  mimicked  those  of  an  AXIS 
(Philips)  equipped  with  an  LEHR  collimator.  About  4.5  and 
27.9 billion photons were simulated for the cubic phantom and 
the cylindrical phantom, respectively.

99m  line  and  point  sources  were  inserted  as  shown;  (b)  water  cylinder

2)  Projector calculation 
For  each  phantom,  a  uniform  Tc-99m  activity  distribution 
within  the  phantom  was  simulated.  30  billion  photons  were 
simulated and 6.9 million photons were detected between 126 
the  cubic  phantom.  These  values 
and  154  keV 
corresponded  to  simulating  30  million  counts  per  voxel  and 
detecting  an  average  of  1078  counts  per  pixel.  The  relative 
uncertainty  D rij/rij  associated  with  each  projector  element  rij 
was  thus  estimated  as  about  0.003  %  (assuming  that detected 
counts  were  uniformly  distributed  over  the  whole  detection 
head).  For  the  cylinder,  about  64  billion  photons  were 
simulated  (244140  counts  per  voxel)  and  about  14  million 
photons were  detected  between  126 and 154  keV (average of 
53  per  pixel).  The  corresponding  relative  uncertainty  D rij/rij 
was thus about 0.25 %. In this latter case, the simulation took 
about  5  days  on  a  cluster  of  40  biprocessors  Pentium  III  1 
GHz. For each phantom, the projector R was then deduced [4]. 

B.  Image reconstruction and assessment 
Data  collected  in  the  126-154  keV  energy  window  were 
reconstructed  with  F3DMC,  implicitly  correcting  for  scatter, 
attenuation  and  finite  spatial  resolution.  Ordered  Subset 
Expectation  Maximisation  (OSEM)  was  used  as  the  iterative 
reconstruction  algorithm  involved  in  F3DMC  (4  subsets,  14 
iterations) [8]. 

To  assess  the  accuracy  of  the  reconstructed  images,  spatial 
resolution,  signal-to-noise  ratio  (calculated  from 20  replicates 
of  noisy  projections),  activity  ratios  and  absolute  activity 
measurements  were  measured.  For 
the  cubic  phantom, 
volumes of interest (VOI) consisting of the hottest 4 pixels in 

each  Tc-99m  line  were  considered  to  calculate  activity  ratios 
between the Z and Y lines, and between the Z and X lines. For 
the  cylinder,  activity  ratios  between  each  cylinder  and  the 
background  activity  were  calculated,  by  considering 
cylindrical VOIs having diameters equal to the actual diameter 
of  the  different  cylinders.  A  background  VOI  of  8  pixels  in 
diameter  was  drawn  at  the  centre  of  the  cylinder.  Activity 
ratios were also calculated on the original activity images used 
for  the  simulation,  to  separate  the  effect  of  sampling  and  the 
effect of reconstruction in the bias affecting the activity ratios. 
Absolute  quantitation  was  assessed  by  calculating 
the 
percentage  of  recovered  activity  (%RA)  for  each  phantom  as 
follows:  %RA  =  100*(estimated  phantom  activity)/(simulated 
phantom  activity),  where  the  estimated  phantom  activity  was 
calculated as the number of counts in the reconstructed images 
divided by the simulated acquisition time. 

C.  Study of F3DMC robustness with respect to noise in the 
projector and modeling errors 
Using  the  cubic  phantom,  results  obtained  with  projectors 
corresponding  to  1  billion  and  30  billion  simulated  counts 
were  compared.  Two  strategies  of  filtering  the  projector  to 
reduce the noise were also considered: 
(cid:1)  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  [9]  of  the  projector. 
Assuming an acquisition of P projections of N ·
 N pixels 
and an object of N ·
 N voxels to be reconstructed, the 
projector of dimensions (PN2,N3) is first reorganized as P 
vectors of N5 elements. A PCA analysis of these P vectors 
is  performed,  yielding  P  eigenvalues  associated  with  P 
eigenvectors.  A  filtered  version  of  the  projector  is 
obtained  by  estimating  the  P  vectors  from  the  K 
eigenvectors  associated  with  the  K  highest  eigenvalues, 
with K<P. 

 N ·

(cid:1)  setting to zero probability values in the projector that are 
below  a  given  threshold  [10]:  threshold  values  were 
expressed  as  a  percentage  of  the  maximum  probability 
value  in  the  projector,  and  were  varied  from  0.1%  and 
10%. 

Two  types  of  errors  in  modeling  the  projector  R  were 
considered  for  the  cubic  phantom.  First,  a  4  keV  shift  in  the 
energy  calibration  of 
the  camera  was  mimicked  by 
reconstructing data recorded in the 122-150 keV energy range 
using a projector calculated for the 126-154 keV energy range. 
Second,  a  shift  in  spatial  sampling  was  introduced  by 
introducing a 2 mm or 5 mm off-set horizontally and vertically 
between the grid used to calculate the projections and that used 
to calculate the projector. 

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A.  Effect of noise in the projector and filtering procedures 
Table 1 shows how increasing the number of simulated counts 
used to estimate the projector improves spatial  resolution  and 
signal-to-noise  ratio,  without  affecting  the  quantitative  results 
much.  PCA  filtering  also  improves  spatial  resolution  and 

 

signal-to-noise  ratio, 
together  with  relative  quantitation, 
suggesting that high statistics simulations combined with PCA 
filtering should be used to achieve the best results. Setting low 
probability values in the projector to zero did not appear as an 
efficient way for reducing noise in the projector. 
Results  on  the  cubic  phantom  suggested  that,  when  filtering 
the  projector,  rij  values  should  be  estimated  with  a  relative 
uncertainty  at  least  inferior  to  0.003  %  to  yield  excellent 
results with F3DMC. Using this empirical rule for the cylinder 
phantom,  one  can  roughly  estimate  the  minimum  number  of 
photons  that  should  be  simulated  to  get  a  robust  enough 
projector. Assuming a uniform distribution of detected counts, 
about 1300 billion counts should be simulated to get a robust 
projector, i.e. a projector with a statistics about 20 times higher 
than the one considered in this study. 

B.  Robustness of F3DMC with respect to modeling error 
Table 2 shows that F3DMC results were almost not affected 
by  what  was  supposed  to  mimic  a  4  keV  shift  in  the  energy 
calibration  of  the  gamma  camera  (P1).  They  were  weakly 
affected by the 2 mm off-set between the sampling grid used to 
calculate the projector and the sampling grid used to calculate 
the projection (P2). The results strongly deteriorate for a 5 mm 
shift  (P3),  consistent  with  the  fact  that  the  sources  in  the 
phantom were 1 cm thick. 

C.  Cylindrical phantom 
Ideal  images  and  images  reconstructed  using  the  F3DMC 
are  shown  in  Figure  2,  each  image  being  scaled  so  that  its 
maximum  value  corresponds  to  the  maximum  value  of  the 
color scale. Quantitative indices are given in Table 3.

slice reconstructed with F3DMC. 

 
Results  show  that  image  sampling  itself  decreases  activity 
ratios compared to their ideal value, from 55% for the smallest 
hot  cylinder  to  33%  for  the  biggest  hot cylinder.  Considering 
the value measured on the spatially sampled activity maps as a 

reference, F3DMC yielded accurate activity ratio estimates for 
sphere  sizes  down  to  9.5  mm  in  diameter,  suggesting  a  local 
spatial resolution in the reconstructed image of about 5 mm. 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Using the cubic phantom, we have shown the importance of 
calculating  the  projector  from  a  high  statistics  simulation  and 
the  added  value  of  reducing  noise  in  the  projector  by 
appropriate  filtering.  In  addition,  F3DMC  appears  robust 
enough with respect to small errors in energy calibration of the 
gamma  camera  and  small  shifts  between  the  voxel  sampling 
used  to  calculate  the  projector  and  the  sampling  of  the 
projections.  The  feasibility  of  reconstructing  64  projections 
64x64 of a realistic object using F3DMC has also been proven 
with  encouraging  results,  in  terms  of  spatial  resolution 
recovery and quantification.

Abstract 
The local “when” earthquake prediction is based on the connection between geomagnetic “quakes” 
and the next incoming minimum or maximum of tidal gravitational potential. The probability time 
window for the predicted earthquake is for the tidal minimum approximately +/-1 day and for the 
maximum-  +/-2  days.  The  preliminary  statistic  estimation  on  the  basis  of  distribution  of  the  time 
difference between occurred and predicted earthquakes for the period 2002- 2003 for Sofia region is 
given.  
The possibility for creating a local “when, where” earthquake research and prediction NETWORK 
is based on the accurate monitoring of the electromagnetic field  with special space and time scales 
under, on and over the Earth surface.  The  periodically  upgraded  information  from  seismic  hazard 
maps and other standard geodetic information as well as other precursory information is essential. 
 
Introduction 

The problem of  “when, where and how” earthquake prediction can’t  be solved  only on the 
basis of geodetic data (Aki; Main, 1999a,b; Ludwin, 2001;  Pakiser and Shedlock;  Geller et al.). 
The  possible  tidal  trigging  of  the  earthquakes  has  been  investigated  for  a  long  period  of  time 
(Knopoff, 1964; Ryabl at al., 1968; Shlien, 1972; Molher, 1980, Sounau et al., 1982; Shirley, 1988, 
Bragin, 1999). The conclusion that the earthquake’s time is correlated with the tidal extremums is 
not unique, because in some of the extremums there are not earthquakes.  

The including of additional information in the monitoring, for example, the analysis of the 
Earth electrical currents signals, permits to estimate the most probable time of incoming earthquake 
(Thanassoulas 1991, Thanassoulas et al., 2001a, b). 

The more accurate space and time measuring set for the Earth’s crust condition parameters, 
the including in the monitoring of the electromagnetic fields measurements under, on and over the 
Earth surface, the temperature distribution and other possible precursors can be useful for the study 
of  the  “when,  where  and  how”  earthquake’s  prediction.  For  example  in  the  paper  Varotsos  and 
Alexopoulos, 1984a, b; Varotsos at al., 1996, the possibility for short-term earthquake prediction in 
Greece  by  seismic  electric  signals  was  investigated.  The  results  of  observations  on  seismo-
electromagnetic waves at two earthquake experimental areas in China were presented in the paper 
Qian at al., 1994. 

The  atmospheric  and  ionospheric  electromagnetic  phenomena  associated  with  earthquakes 
were analyzed in many books and papers (Hayakawa and Fujinawa, 1994; Hayakawa et al., 1999, 
Hayakawa et al., 2000, Hayakawa and Molchanov, 2002) and the future direction of investigation 
related to earthquake prediction was proposed, as well as its practical application to some concrete 
events.  The  papers  of  Oike  and  Ogawa,  1982,  1994  concern  the  observations  of  electromagnetic 
radiation  in  the  LF  and  VLF  ranges  related  with  the  occurrence  of  earthquake.  The  results  of 
complex  investigation  of  the  variations  of  crust  electrical  resistivity  as  a  function  of  tidal 
deformations  on  the  basis  of  extremely  low  frequency  radio  station,  which  permit  the  hope  for 
increase  the  reliability  of  electromagnetic  based  earthquake  prediction,  are  presented  in  paper  of 
Saraev et al., 2002.   

In papers of Eftaxias 2001, 2002 are presented evidences that electromagnetic anomalyties 

in wide range of radio frequencies from ULF, VLF to VHF have been observed before some 
destructive earthquakes in continental Greece.

The impressive results of modified VAN method are presented in papers and web site (ws) 
(Thanassoulas,  1991;  Thanassoulas  et  al.,  ws;  Thanassoulas  et  al.,  2001  a,  b,  c,  d,  e),  where,  the 
appropriate measuring of electric Earth signals and their analysis demonstrates that the direction to 
the  epicenter  of  incoming  earthquake  can  be  estimated  and  the  time  is  defined  from  the  next 
exstremum  of  tidal  potential.  Some  possible  geophysical  models  of  the  phenomena  are  proposed 
and the prediction of the future magnitude is analyzed. The including of more than one site in the 
monitoring  will  permit  short  term  earthquake  prediction  and  will  give  some  estimation  for  the 
magnitude (Thanassoulas, ws). 

In site Ustundag and papers cited there, are presented the results of electropotential 
monitoring, based on the special constructed electrometer and appropriate temporal data acquisition 
system, for researching the electropotential variations as earthquake precursor. 
One have to mention the satellite possibilities for monitoring the radiation activity of the Earth 
surface for discovering the anomalyties, which should be the earthquake precursor: Dean, ws. 

The analyses of the data from satellite monitoring for the ionosphere and the Earth radiation 
belt  parameters  also  give  evidences  for  anomalyties  which  can  be  interpreted  as  earthquake 
precursor. The information for the last results from the developing of earthquake precursor research 
could be found in the conference sites: Contadakis, 2002 and Papadopoulos, 2003. 
The data for the connection between incoming earthquake and meteorology effects like 
quasistationary earthquakes clouds can be seen in the site Zhonghao. The statistic from 1993 for the 
reliability of prediction is also represented together with some theoretical models and estimations 
for the effect. 

In order to summarize the results we can say, that the standard geodetic monitoring USGS Pf 

ws, the monitoring of different component of electromagnetic field under, on and over the Earth 
surface, some of the atmospheric anomalyties and behavior of charge distribution in the Earth 
radiation belts (see for example Silina, 2001; Larkina and Ruzhin, 2003), sometime could serve as 
unique earthquake’s precursor. It is obvious, that for solving the reliability problem different 
approaches should be unified, including the biological precursor data.  

The  progress  in  geomagnetic  quake  earthquake  precursor  approach  (Mavrodiev,  2001)  is 
presented  (Mavrodiev,  2002  a,  b,  2003  a,  b).  The  approach  is  based  on  the  understanding  that 
earthquake  processes  have  a  complex  origin.  Without  creating  of  adequate  physical  model  of  the 
Earth existence, the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions, which ensure the stability of the 
Sun  system  and  its  planets  for  a  long  time,  the  Earth  prediction  problem  can  not  be  solved.  The 
earthquake part of the model can be repeated in the infinity way “theory- experiment- theory” using 
nonlinear  inverse  problem  methods  looking  for  the  correlations  between  fields  in  dynamically 
changed space and time scales. Of course, every approximate model (see for example Thanassoulas, 
1991; Thanassoulas et al., 2001a, b) which has some experimental evidence has to be included in 
the  analysis.  It  seems  obvious  that  the  problem  of  adequate  physical  understanding  of  the 
correlations  between  electromagnetic  precursors,  tidal  extremums  and  incoming  earthquake  is 
connected with the progress of the Earth magnetism theory. 

The  achievement  of  the  Earth  surface  tidal  potential  modelling,  which  includes  the  ocean 
and atmosphere tidal influences, is an essential part of the research. In this sense the comparison of 
the  Earth  tides  analysis  programs  (Dierks  and  Neumeyer,  ws)  for  the  ANALYZE  from  the 
ETERNA-package,  version  3.30  (Wenzel,  1996a,  b),  program  BAYTAP-G  in  the  version  from 
15.11.1999  (Tamura,  1991),  Program  VAV  (version  from  April  2002)  -  Venedikov  et  al,  2001, 
2002 is very useful.     

The  role  of  geomagnetic  variations  as  precursor  could  be  explained  by  the  obvious 
hypothesis that during the time before the earthquakes, with the strain, deformation or displacement 
grows in the crust in some interval of density changing, arise the chemical phase shift which leads 
to an electrical charge shift. The preliminary Fourier analysis of geomagnetic field gives the time 
period  of  alteration  in  minute  scale.  Such  specific  geomagnetic  variation  we  call  geomagnetic

quake.  The  piezo-  effect  model  for  electrical  currents  can  not  explain  the  alternations  due  to  its 
linearity.  

 K-index  (Balsh),  accepted  for  the  geomagnetic  conditions,  can  not  indicate  well  the  local 
geomagnetic variation for time minutes period, because it is calculated on the basis of 3 hours data. 
Nevertheless,  the  K-  index  behavior  in  the  near  space  has  to  be  analyzed  because  of  the  possible 
Sun  wind  influence  on  the  local  behavior  of  geomagnetic  filed.  If  the  field  components  are 
measured many times per second, one can calculate the frequency dependence of full geomagnetic 
intensity and to analyze the frequency spectrum of geomagnetic quake. If the variations are bigger 
than usual for some period of time, one can say that we have the geomagnetic quake, which is the 
earthquake precursor. The nonlinear inverse problem analysis for 1999- 2001 of geomagnetic and 
earthquake  data  for  Sofia  region  gives  an    estimation,  that  the    probability  time  window  for  the 
predicted earthquake (event, events) is approximately minimum +/-1 day and maximum +/-2 days 
of the Earth for the tidal potential .  

The future epicenter coordinates could be estimated from the data from at least 3 points of 
measuring the geomagnetic vector, using the inverse  problem  methods,  applied for the estimation 
the coordinates of the volume, where the phase shift arrived in the framework of its time window.  

In  the  case  of    incoming  big  earthquake  (magnitude  >  5  -  6)  the  changes  of  vertical 
electropotential  distribution,  the  Earth  temperature,  the  infrared  Earth  radiation,  the  behavior  of 
water sources, its chemistry and radioactivity, the atmosphere conditions (earthquakes clouds, etc.) 
and  the  charge  density  of  the  Earth  radiation  belt,  have  to  be  dramatically  changed  near  the 
epicenter area.  

The  achievements  of  tidal  potential  modeling  of  the  Earth  surface,  including  ocean  and 
atmosphere  tidal  influences,  multi-  component  correlation  analysis  and  nonlinear  inverse  problem 
methods in fluids dynamics and electrodynamics are crucial for every single step of the constructing 
of the mathematical and physical models.  

In  Part  1  are  given  the  2002-  2003  statistics  estimations  for  the  reliability  of  the  time 
window earthquake prediction on the basis of geomagnetic field measurements (Mavrodiev, 2002b) 
and the Earth tidal behavior Venedikov at al., 2002] for Sofia region  

In Part 2 the posterior analysis for Alaska, 2002, Magnitude 8.2 earthquake on the basis of 
seconds  CMO  geomagnetic  data  and  for  Hokkaido  2003,  MMB  minute  geomagnetic  data  is 
presented. 

In  Part  3  a  short  proposal  for  creating  of  Short  Time  Earthquake  prediction  in  local 

NETWORK is given. 
 
Part  1.The  geomagnetic  field  quake  as  a  time  window  earthquake’s  precursor  for  Balkan, 
Black Sea region 

It is useful to stress that the author’s interests to the earthquake’s prediction problem arise as  
a  result  of  complex  research  of  the  Black  Sea  ecosystem  about  15  years  ago  (Mavrodiev,  1998). 
During  the  time  of  gathering  the  historical  data  for  the  ecosystem  was  observed,  that  the  Crime 
earthquake in 1928 occurred, as an evidence for electromagnetic and earthquake correlations. Such 
hypothesis has been proposed by the academician Popov in the early 20- 30-ties of the last century 
(private communication).  

According  the  INTERMAGNET  requirements  for  measuring  the  geomagnetic  field  (see 
Figure  1)  on  Earth  surface  (http://www.intermagnet.org),  the  accuracy  is  ±10  nT  for  95%  of 
reported data and ±5 nT for definitive data, with one sample per 5 seconds, in the case of Vector 
magnetometer  (F  (XYZ)  or  F  (HDZ))  and  1  nT,  with  3  samples  per  second,  for  Scalar 
Magnetometer (F).  

The geomagnetic vector projection H is measured with relative accuracy less or equal to1 nT 
by  a  fluxgate,  feedback  based  device  of  rather  original  and  simple,  but  powerful  construction. 
(know-  how  of  JINR,  Dubna,  Boris  Vasiliev,  1998,  private  communication).  It  is  used  with  2.4 

 

 

samples  per  second.  Due  to  technical  reasons  the  sensor  was  oriented  under  the  Horizon  in  a 
manner that the measured value of H is around 20000 nT (see Figures 1 and 2).

 Looking  for  the  correlations  between  the  behavior  of  the  geomagnetic  field,  Earth  tidal 
gravitational potential and the occurred earthquakes (from 1999 to 2001)  it turns out that the daily 
averaged value of

geomagnetic  field  and  its  variation,  which  is  unusual.  Is  this  case  there  is  a  geomagnetic  quake, 
which is precursor for incoming event (earthquake or earthquakes). One has to be sure that there are 
not a cosmos or Sun wind reasons for the geomagnetic quake (see the sites [NOAA ws].

For  example in Figure 4 the predicted time was 3 +/- 1 June, 2002 and the prediction was 
confirmed with earthquake, occurred at 03/06/2002 02:04, Lat41.95N, Lon23.10E, Dep8, Mag2.6, 
Ml, 50 km from Sofia, SChtM = 598 [Mag/r2].  
The  preliminary  Fourier  analysis  of 

data  gives  the  fact  that  the  bigger  geomagnetic 
variations are cased from the arriving for hours time period new frequencies with periods from 10-
th of seconds till 10-th of minutes and with very specific amplitude behavior. Such spectrum, which 
arrives for hour period of time, is invisible for minute samples measuring.  

mH

The probability time window of the incoming event (or events) is defined by the next date of 
the Earth tidal potential extremum with tolerance approximately for the tidal minimum +/-1 day and 
for the maximum +/-2 days- Figure 6. 

 

 

 

 

7

The uncertainty of distinguishing the predicted event (or group of events – for example 

 
aftershocks) from the events which occurred in the region at different distances and magnitudes in 
the predicted time window is solved on the basis of inverse problem methods with new 
earthquake’s influence characteristic function SChtM:

The  physical  sense  of  the  function  SChtM  is  a  density  distribution  on  the  Earth  surface  of 
earthquake’s  magnitude  [magnitude  vs.  distribution].  In  the  point  of  measurement  SChtM  is 
logarithmically proportional to the energy influence of the earthquakes. It is important to point out 
that the first consideration of the magnitude and distance dependences was obtained on the basis of 
nonlinear  inverse  problem  methods.  Obviously,  the  nearer  and  biggest  earthquake  (relatively 
biggest value of SChtM) will bear more electropotential variations, which will generate more power 
geomagnetic quake. At this stage of the study, as a measure of daily geomagnetic state can serve the 
value of averaged for 24 hours (1440 minutes) standard deviation σHm:

The simple and usually working criterion for evidence of geomagnetic quake is when 
Sig increases for two consecutive days i, i+1 and the differences between the values of Sig are 
bigger than the mean arithmetic sum of their errors ∆Sig: 

(2)              Abs (Sigi+1 – Sigi ) > (∆Sigi + ∆Sig i+1)/2.  

If  criteria  (2)  are  fulfilled  and  there  are  not  a  Cosmos  and  Sun  generated  variations  of 
geomagnetic  field,  it  could  be  concluded  that  the  geomagnetic  quake  has  happened.  Such 
quake is unique precursor for incoming earthquake and in the next minimum or maximum of 
the local Tidal gravitational potential somewhere in the region this predicted earthquake will 
occur.  

For  some  of  the  cases,  the  criteria  (2)  have  to  be  calculated  for  decades  of  hours  or 

ten’s of minutes. 

The  signal for earthquakes with different epicenters we observe in the case when the 
specific  behavior  of  field  and  its  standard  deviation  occurs  more  than  ones  per  day  at 
different hours. 

The  analysis  of  the  precursor  function  Sig  on  the  basis  of  special  digital  5  points 

derivatives can serve in the future for creating the algorithm for automated alert system.  

It  is  obvious  that  the  more  detailed  time  window  can  be  achieved  by  analyzing  the  daily 

variations of tidal potential, calculated every hour.  

As an example, the parameters of predicted events (Figure 5) are presented in Table 1.

At this stage of the study all earthquakes have the same SChtM for different definitions of the 
magnitude. After the developing of mathematical models of empirical and theoretical dependences 
between incoming earthquake processes, magnetic quake and parameters of earthquake on the basis 
of  inverse  nonlinear  problem  we  will  obtain  a  set  of  SChtM  functions  in  correspondence  with  the 
different definition of magnitude. The volumes, its depth, chemical and geological structures of the 
region have to be included in the dependences as well. 

 Figure  7  illustrates  the  possibility  for  registration  of  big  world  earthquakes  by  specific 

behavior of the geomagnetic change.

In  Figures  8,  9,  10  and  11  the  tidal  potential,  SChtM,  magnitude,  distance  from  Sofia  and 
function  Sig  are  presented  for  every  quarter  of  2003.  In  the  text  boxes  are  the  data  of  the 
geomagnetic  quake  (date  of  the  precursory  signal)  and  the  time  window  for  predicted  event 
(events).

In Figure 12 the distributions of the difference between the times of predicted events, which 
occurred, calculated for 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (starting from January, 2002), are presented. The 
distribution growth, without widening and its approximation to the Gaussian distribution with the 
time,  is  an  argument  for  the  causality-  consequences  origin  between  the  correlation  geomagnetic 
signal- tidal potential exstremum and occurred earthquake. The number of earthquakes in Figure 12 
is  greater  than  the  number  of  the  predictions  for  the  events.  The  explanation  of  this  is  that  some 
earthquakes with greater magnitude are following by aftershocks.

In  Figure  13  the  distributions  of  the  difference  between  times  of  all  occurred  earthquakes  in  the 
region  (distance  less  than  500  km),  magnitude  grater  then  2.6  and  the  corresponding  tidal 
extremums time, calculated for 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (starting from January, 2002) as well the 
comparison  with  Figure  12  are  presented.  The  fact,  that  the  distributions  of  all  earthquakes  are 
flatter  than  the  distributions  of  predicted    earthquakes,  can  be  consider  as  evidence  that  the 
correlation between geomagnetic quake and tidal extremum in the framework of physical mean of 
function SChtM is a reliable precursor.    

Next  Figure  14  expresses  the  obvious  fact  that  the  incoming  earthquake  with  grater 
magnitude  can  be  predicted  at  greater  distances.  Nowadays  estimation  is  that  bigger  earthquakes 
(magnitude >5) could be predicted for distances till 500- 600 km.

In Figure 15 is represented the magnitude distribution of the predicted events- 380. It could 
be seen that the earthquakes with magnitude less then 3 are a small part (26 %) of all predicted and 
occurred earthquakes.

The  independent  control  (in  the  framework  of  Strasbourg  recommendations  about 
earthquake  prediction  of  the  European  Union  for  ethical  and  public  security  reasons)  of  the  time 
window  earthquake  prediction  reliability  was  organized  in  the  framework  of  the  Bulgarian 
Academy of Sciences, its Geophysical Institute and colleagues from Greece and Turkey, which are 
interested in this topic of research (Tsatsaragos, ws; Ustundag, ws), starting from January 2002. 

As a conclusion, from the observations for the analyzed period 2002- 2003 there were 110 
extremums  of  tidal  potential  and  96  events  (486  for  2002  and  552  for  2003).  For  85  of  them  the 
time window was successfully predicted. For two of occurred events the precursor quake was not 
established (in the first month of the reported time period) by the everyday analysis and 9 events 
were not predicted, because of hardware problem. The total number of earthquakes with magnitude 
grater then 2.5 was 1038. The epicenter of the incoming event can not be estimated using one point 
geomagnetic  data,  so  one  can  not  number  the  really  predicted  earthquakes.  But  there  are  visible 
correlations between hazard risk estimation map (Giardini et al., 2003) and Figure 16.  

The above results for reliability time window earthquake prediction can be consider as a first 
preliminary  step  for  solution  of  “when,  where  and  how”  earthquake  prediction  at  level  “when”, 
using the geomagnetic measurements. 

The  first  prove,  that  in  the  framework  of  such  complex  approach,  the  “when,  where  and 
how” earthquake prediction problem can be solve will be the “when, where” prediction on the basis 
of at least 3 points for electromagnetic real time monitoring. If the statistic estimation is successful 
for a long enough period of time (6- 12 months) and the established correlations are confirmed by 
the  adequate  physical  model  solutions,  one  could  say  that  the  earthquake  prediction  problem  is 
under solving using the geomagnetic quake precursor.

Although  the  geomagnetic  data  are  only  seconds,  the  correlation  between  geomagnetic 
precursor  function  and  incoming  earthquake  is  clearly  seen  for  3  events,  including  the  big 
earthquake with magnitude = 8.5. The second CMO geomagnetic data were kindly given by USA 
Intermagnet group. 

Hokkaido 2003, MMB minute geomagnetic data  
The  preliminary  analysis  on  the  basis  of  Sofia  region  experience  of  the  second  MMB 
Intermagnet data shows that the Hokkaido could be a good polygon for testing the possibility for 
``when, where'' eq's prediction if two more Intermagnet geomagnetic sites F(HDZ) with at least 10 
samples per second will be created. 

Analogous  analysis  for  the  regions,  where  there  are  Intermagnet  geomagnetic  stations,  for 
establishing  the  correlation  between  local  geomagnetic  quake  and  incoming,  in  time  window, 
defined  from  the  time  of  next  minimum  or  maximum  of  the  Tidal  behavior,  earthquakes,  was 
performed for England, India, Turkey regions (Mavrodiev 2003 a, b). 
Part 3. Proposal for creating of Short Time Earthquake prediction local NETWORK  
We will not discuss the long time prognostic system for estimation of earthquake risk. According to 
Keilis-Borok, ws and Giardini et al., 2003 they are well known. 

The aim of this Proposal is to create a system for study of the reliability of the local forecast 
system for earthquakes in the interval Mag > 2.6- 3 and radius till 600 km. The system is complex 
and the attended practical result will be a short time “when, where” eq’s prediction. The problem 
“when,  where  and  how”  will  be  solved  step  by  step  in  creating  an  adequate  physical  theoretical 
model for the Earth magnetism. For such complex research a new type of scientific unification has 
to be realized including experimental, theoretical and technological parts:  
Experimental data for:  
Geomagnetic  field,  Electro-potential  distribution  in  the  Earth  crust  and  atmosphere,  Temperature 
Earth  crust  distribution,  Crust  parameters  (strain,  deformation,  displacement),  Gravitational 
anomaly  map,  Season  and  day  independent  depth  temperature  distribution,  Water  sources 

 

 

15

parameters  (debit,  temperature,  chemical  composition,  radioactivity),  Gas  emissions,  Ionosphere 
condition  parameters,  Infrared  radiation  of  Earth  surface,  earthquake  clouds,  Earth  radiation  belt, 
Sun wind, Biological precursors.  
Theory:  The  achievements  of  tidal  potential  modeling  of  Earth  surface  including  ocean  and 
atmosphere  tidal  influences,  multi-  component  correlation  analyses,  nonlinear  inverse  problem 
methods in fluids dynamics and Maxwell equations are crucial. 
Technologies:  GIS  for  archiving,  analysis,  visualization  and  interpretation  of  the  data  and  non- 
linear  inverse  problem  methods  for  creating  of  theoretical  models  for  the  parameters  behavior, 
correlations and dynamics. 

The set of the devices used, has to be in correspondence with known data for earthquakes 
risk zone (gravitational anomalyties, crust parameters monitoring-strain, deformation, displacement 
and seismic hazard evaluation maps). The geomagnetic device set distance has to be 150 – 200 km, 
the  electro-  potential  from  100  to  200  km  in  dependence  of  present  geological  situation  and  its 
history. The set for monitoring of the daily and season crust temperatures has to be in the range of 
100 km. The correlations with Sun wind influence have to be estimated in real time.  

The  system  has  to  be  created  step  by  step.  The  condition  for  next  step  has  to  be  build  on 
physically  clear  new  theoretical  correlations  or  dynamical  models  and,  of  course,  the  successful 
“when”, “when, where” or “when, where and how” earthquake predictions. 

Finally, the number of world earthquake’s with magnitude greater then 4 are represented in 
Fig.  19.  The  correlation  between  the  eq’s  number,  global  warming  and  consequent  increasing  the 
sea level and the amplitude of ocean tides is obvious. The possible explanation is in the fact, that the 
global  warming,  because  of  ice  decreasing,  is  a  reason  for  perturbation  of  the  momentum 
equilibrium  of  the  Earth  and  of  the  Ocean  tidal  amplitudes  increasing.  So,  the  continents 
movements are activated in such manner, that the number of earthquakes increase. The fact, that 
the number of earthquakes with magnitude grater then 7, conserve its chaotic character, can 
be  interpreted  as  a  chance  that  we  have  still  some  time  to  stop  the  global  warming  and  to 
prevent incoming anthropogenic geodetic disasters.   

Conclusion 
The  correlations  between  the  local  geomagnetic  quake  and  incoming  earthquakes,  which 
occur in the time window defined from tidal minimum (+/- 1 day) or maximum (+/-2 days) of the 
Earth  tidal  gravitational  potential  are  tested  statistically.  The  distribution  of  the  time  difference 
between predicted and occurred events is going to be Gaussian with the increasing of the statistics.

This  result  can  be  interpreted  as  a  possible  first  reliable  approach  for  solving  the  “when” 

earthquakes prediction problem using the geomagnetic data. 

On the basis of electromagnetic monitoring under, on and over Earth surface a research for 
solution of “when, where” earthquake prediction problem is proposed. Under the hypothesis that the 
current,  which  born  the  geomagnetic  quake,  has  bigger  vertical  component,  the  data  of  two 
geomagnetic  vector  devices  are  enough  for  determination  of  the  future  epicenter.  Three  devices 
equipment  will  permit  to  study  the  correlation  between  Earth  surface  distribution  of  precursor 
function Sig and the magnitude of the incoming earthquake. 

In the last Figure 20 is presented the reliability test for time prediction, using the new SChtM 

function [Energy / squared distance] for 2003.

Abstract

The method of geodesic expansion is developed, which can be used in semiclassi-
cal approximations of path integrals over curved functional spaces. Furthermore, the
integral measure for such approximations is obtained.

The quantization of the bosonic string in a general curved space-time has been the subject

of intensive research for some time [1, 2, 3, 4]. Whereas the treatment by de Vega [1]

relies on the canonical quantization, only few attempts of a path integral quantization have

been made. Those attempts [3, 4] involved the semi-classical approximation, but despite

their conceptual simplicity no attempt was made to reproduce the critical dimension in ﬂat

space-time, which would have been an indication for the validity of the results.

In fact,

the path integral measure was treated naively in [3], while a mistake in [4] will become

clear in this letter. The aim of this letter is to provide the very ﬁrst step of the semiclassical

treatment of the path integral for the bosonic string in curved space-time, namely a covariant

and unambiguous expansion scheme as well as the appropriate path integral measure. The

proposed method is applicable to the semiclassical treatment of path integrals in any curved

functional space. Hence, it shall be formulated in general terms.

Consider the points X of a space M with Riemannian structure, i.e. X has components

X a, where a belongs to an arbitrary set of indices (discrete as in usual Riemannian spaces

or continuous as in functional spaces) [5]. Furthermore, a metrix tensor hab exists such that

ds2 = habdX adX b.

(1)

The metric connections (Christoﬀel symbols) and curvature tensor can be deﬁned as usual

[6].

Now consider two points X0 and X1 in M, which are (in some intuitive sense) close to

each other and which therefore can be connected by a unique geodesic. Let θ be the aﬃne

parameter of this geodesic, i.e. the geodesic equation is

∂2
∂θ2

X a(θ) + Γa
bc

∂
∂θ

X b ∂
∂θ

X c = 0,

and let θ be scaled such that X a(0) = X a

0 and X a(1) = X a

1 . Thus, the parameterization of

the geodesic connecting X0 and X1 is uniquely speciﬁed.

The aim is to expand functionals f [X] in a power series in the parameter θ in order to

obtain an approximation for f [X1]. Let us start with X1 itself. The Taylor series naturally

begins as

Equation (4) shows the great virtue of the geodesic expansion, namely that all higher

order derivatives of X(θ) can be expressed in terms of

˙Xby means of the geodesic equation.

The vector

˙X, being equal to δX in a ﬂat space (X1 = X0 + δX), can quite generally be

regarded as the expansion parameter. We will henceforth say that the geodesic expansion

maps X0 into X1 and denote this mapping by ˙X : X0 →

X1.

The next task is to develop an approximate integration scheme based on the geodesic ex-

pansion. Consider the invariant integration in M. The integration measure

X is explicitely

In a semiclassical approximation one can regard the integration variable X as a variation of

a (classical) background X0 and use the geodesic expansion to change integration variables

from X to ˙Xwith terms up to second order in ˙Xretained in the integral measure. First,

[dX a] =

Whereas the ﬁrst term in the exponent on the r.h.s. is covariant, the others are not. Equation

(8) was also derived in [4] with the conclusion that the non-covariant terms arise as quantum

In our opinion this conclusion is wrong. As will be shown below, the non-

covariant terms are exactly cancelled by terms arising from the expansion of √h (h = det hab).

The exponential in (9) cancels the non-covariant terms in (8) just as desired.

It remains to establish that the geodesic expansions form a group and that the integral

measure (10) is in fact the right-invariant Haar measure [7]. For this purpose,

˙X has to be

considered as a vector ﬁeld ˙X[X] with ˙X[X0] being the special value, which we met so far.

Clearly an identity exists, given by ˙X = 0, and the inverse of any transformation can be

found by inverting (4). We will now show that the product property and the associative law

are also satisﬁed. This calculation is best performed order by order as will be demonstrated.

Consider two expansions,

˙X1 and ˙X2 such that

˙X1 : X0 →

X1 and ˙X2 : X1 →

X2.

Assume now that the product property is satisﬁed, i.e. there exists an expansion ˙X such

X2. Consider the ﬁnal point X2, which is to ﬁrst order explicitely

that ˙X = ˙X2 ◦
given by (cf. eqn. (4))

˙X1 : X0 →

where ˙X1,2 denotes ˙X1,2[X0] for brevity and the underset numbers represent the order in ˙X,

up to which the marked quantity is to be evaluated. Comparing (11) with (4) we can read

oﬀ

˙X a

Continuing with the second order, we ﬁnd

(13)

The calculation of the third order proceeds in the same fashion, but is naturally more in-

volved. Hence we will give only the result,

It is straightforward to check from (14) that the associative law is also satisﬁed. Therefore

the geodesic expansions form a group.

In order to show the right-invariance of the integral measure (10), we consider the measure

˙X2 and change variables to ˙X = ˙X2 ◦

˙X1. We obtain from (14) to second order

From (10) and (16) it can clearly be seen that

˙X =

˙X2. This establishes the result

D

D

that the integral measure (10) is the right-invariant Haar measure of the group of geodesic

expansions.

In conclusion, we developed the covariant method of geodesic expansion and derived the

integral measure to be used in a semiclassical approximation based on the geodesic expansion.

The method can be applied to the semiclassical quantization of the bosonic string, if special

care is given to the group of diﬀeomorphisms, whose integral measure has to be separated

from (10). It is intended to demonstrate this application in a later publication.

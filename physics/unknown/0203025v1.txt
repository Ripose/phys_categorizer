Reinterpretation of Lorentz Transformation and resolution of Special
Relativity’s paradoxes.

  Centro  de  Electrodinâmica e Departamento de Física do IST

  Rodrigo de Abreu

Lorentz Transformation is reinterpreted. It is shown that by admitting the existence of a
frame  of  reference  with  synchronized  clocks,  we  conclude  that  any  other  frame  of
reference  that  moves  related  to  the  first  has  desynchronized  clocks.  From  this
conclusion we will arrive at a  new  expression  to  relate the  time  of  different  frames  of
reference. We will also arrive at a new expression to relate the contraction of different
frames. We will show that if the maximum speed on the frame with synchronized clocks
is  the  speed  of  light,  then  the  speed  of  light  varies  accordingly  to  the  velocity  of  the
frame  of  reference.  The  new  interpretation  of  Lorentz  Transformation  explains  and
solves Relativity’s paradoxes.

Abstract

Synopses

The existence of a frame of reference with truly synchronized clocks, which we will call
the resting frame, will be postulated. The existence of a maximum speed as measured by
the resting clocks will also be assumed. We will show that from this premises and using
Lorentz Transformation, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. If we consider a second frame of reference moving relative to the resting frame then
the clocks of that frame are not truly  synchronized. Unlike Relativity claims, only  one
frame of reference can then be considered to be the one at rest and  have  synchronized
clocks.

2. The value by which the clocks are desynchronized varies accordingly to the velocity
relative to rest of the  moving system of coordinates - the  faster the  system  moves, the
larger is the value by which they are desynchronized.

3.  Within  this  frame,  Lorentz  Transformation  gains  a  new  physical  meaning  that
implies, among other things, that:

- Relations between moving systems of coordinates can only be determined with
precision  if  we  know  the  relation  between  their  absolute  velocities  (their  velocities
relative to rest). Lorentz transformation, when  directly  applied  to two  moving  systems
of coordinates, has no physical meaning unless one of the systems has a small absolute
velocity.

- If we have two identical  bars and  if  one  is  moving  faster then  the  other, then
the faster bar will look shorter to the eyes of the slower one, while the slower bar will
seem longer to the faster one. If we replace bars by human twins, the same relation will

occur for age – one twin will see the other age faster. There is  no  reciprocity  between
systems.

-  When  the  same  identical  bars,  or  human  twins,  are  moving  away  from  each
other with symmetrical velocities related to rest, they notice absolutely no change when
looking at each other. Exactly as when they are stopped related to each other.

4.  Relativity’s  postulate  -  that  a  ray  of  light  propagates  with  the  same  speed  when
measured  from  all  systems  of  coordinates  -  apparently  holds,  but  only  because  of  the
very  definition  of  speed  that  together  with  the  definition  of  synchronization  becomes
tautological.

5.  Relativity’s  paradoxes  are  the  result  of  trying  to  interpret  Lorentz  Transformation
without taking in consideration that clocks on moving systems are not synchronized. If
this desynchronization is considered when interpreting Lorentz Transformation, then the
paradoxes cease to exist.

1. Lorentz Transformation implies absolute motion

Relativity allows us to admit any system of coordinates as being at rest and having truly
synchronized  clocks  (Einstein,  A.  [1]  p.  125-127).  Let  us  then  admit  such  a  system  –
we’ll call  it S. Let's also admit a second system of coordinates moving with velocity v
related to S – we’ll call it S’. S' only moves right along the x-axis of S (y=y' and z=z' for
every t). Each of this systems has an infinite number of clocks. There is a different clock
situated on every position of x. There’s also a different clock for every x´. Obviously all
the clocks of S are synchronized in relation to each other since we began by admitting it.
Let us then find out if the same is true for the clocks on S’.

Let’s analyze a "snapshot" of our world. Let’s suppose, for simplicity’s sake, that when
the  clocks  on  S  mark  the  instant  0  (t=0),  the  clock  at  the  origin  of  S’  also  marks  the
instant t’= 0. Let’s also assume that when t=0 the origin of S’ is passing on the origin of
S – this is the "snapshot" we’ll analyze. Lorentz Transformation, for this situation, is the
following system of equations (where k is the maximum speed):

Within  Relativity’s  framework,  this  system  allows  us  to  relate  any  two  frames  of
reference. We’ll then use it to relate S with S’. Since we know that t=0 let us find out t’
for  any  given  x’,  that  is,  let’s  find  the  instant  marked  by  any  given  clock  of  S’.  By
making t=0, from (2) we get:

We  conclude  from  (3)  that  x'„ 0  implies  t'„ 0,  that  is,  every  clock  placed  away
from the origin of S' marks an instant that differs from 0. Our premise was that the clock
on  the  origin  of  S'  marks  the  instant  0,  so  we  conclude  that  all  the  other  clocks  are
desynchronized.  Since  t'  is  a  function  of  x',  all  the  clocks  of  S'  mark  different  times
between each other. The further a clock is from the one placed on the origin, the larger
is  the  desynchronization  between  them.  We  can  also  see  from  (3)  that  the
desynchronization of two given clocks is a function of the velocity of the system1. The
faster a system is moving, the larger is the desynchronization between its clocks2.

We  began  by  admitting  a  frame  of  reference  with  synchronized  clocks.  We
called  this  frame  the  resting  frame.  We  concluded  that  the  use  of  Lorentz
Transformation to relate that frame of reference with any moving frame, implies that the
clocks  on  the  moving  frame  are  not  synchronized.  Only  one  frame  of  reference  has
synchronized  clocks.  That  frame  of  reference  is  different  from  all  the  others.  This
implies  we  cannot,  alternatively,  consider  the  moving  frame  to  be  resting  and  assume
the resting one is moving. One and only one frame of reference can be at rest [2]. On the
other  side,  the  value  of  the  desynchronization  of  a  moving  frame  depends  on  the
velocity  relative  to  the  resting  one.  We  conclude  then,  within  Relativity's  own
framework, that rest and motion are absolute.

2. Reinterpreting Lorentz Transformation

Once  we  understand  clocks  on  moving  frames  are  desynchronized,  we  can  no
longer continue to interpret Lorentz  Transformation  the  same  way  Relativity  does.  On
the other hand, acknowledging this desynchronization allows us to understand the origin
of Relativity's Paradoxes. In order to do that, we'll continue to analyze S and S' as we've
defined them before.

                                                       
1 This function of velocity should not be confused with the one that relates the rhythm of clocks between
systems  of  coordinates.  Acknowledging the  difference  between  rhythm  and  synchronism  is  essential  to
understanding  the  problem  -  notice  that  two  clocks  can  be  moving  at  the  same  rhythm  without  being
synchronized.

2 We've analyzed a specific "snapshot" of our world. It can be easily shown that any other values of t and
t' lead us to the same conclusions.

Accordingly to (3), the instants marked by each clock of S and S', when t=0, can

be illustrated by Fig.1:

Let's consider one of the clocks  of  S', the one  on  x'=0  for  simplicity.  When  our  clock
marks t'=0, the clock that corresponds it on S also marks the instant t=0. We know S’ is
moving related to the resting system of coordinates with velocity v. As time passes and
our  clock  moves  along  S,  it’ll  find  the  clocks  of  S.  We  know  the  clocks  of  S  are
synchronized between each other. All the clocks of S mark the same instant at the same
moment. This  means  that  by  comparing  our  clock  with  the  clocks  it’ll  find  on  S  as  it
moves and times goes by, we can conclude which  is working  faster. That's  what  we’ll
do  by  making  x’=0  on  (2).  For  a  given  t'  of  our  clock,  the  corresponding  clock  of  S
marks the following instant:

We see that as our clock moves along S, it will find the clocks of S marking instants that
keep getting larger then the one our clock marks. The clock of S' is also working, its just
that the clocks of S are working faster. Their rhythms are different. The clocks on S are
getting older faster then those of S' [Einstein, A. [1] p.139).

Let's  now look at the same situation  from the symmetrical point  of  view.  We'll
now focus our attention on a single clock of S - as before our clock will  be the one on
the origin of S, x=0. When our clock marks the instant t=0, the clock that corresponds it
on  S'  is  situated  on  x'=0  and  it  also  marks  t'=0.  As  we  had  assumed,  S  and  S’  are
moving related to each other. S is the resting frame, but it's  moving related to S'. As  it
does, our clock will begin to find the clocks of S'. As we've seen before, the clocks of S'
are moving slower then those of S. We would then expect our clock to find the clocks of
S' marking smaller instants, accordingly to the difference in rhythms. But the clocks of
S' are not synchronized! They were already marking larger instants when our clock left

-
x'=0. They're just all working at the same rhythm. For a given t of our clock (x=0), from
(1) and (2) the corresponding clock of S' marks the following instant

=

As we first look at (5), a full symmetry apparently exists - as the clock of S moves along
S',  it  also  finds  clocks  marking  instants  that  keep  getting  larger.  But  now,  it's  not
because  the  clocks  of  S'  are  working  faster.  It's  the  desynchronization  between  the
clocks of S', combined with the difference in rhythms, that makes it seem that way. The
value of t’ on (5) is not the time that passed on S’ when t time has passed on our clock.
t’  is  solely  the  instant  the  clock  of  S’  reads  when  our  clock  reaches  it.  We  cannot
conclude that S' is getting older faster then S3. We must find another way to compare the
rhythm of the clock of S with that of the clocks S’.

Since  all  the  clocks  of  S’  are  moving  at the  same  rhythm,  we  can  use  a  single
clock of S’ for comparison. We can find the time passed on that clock, for a given time
passed on the clock of S.

Let us go back to t=0, when the origins of S and S’ coincide (Fig 1). After a given t the
origin of S arrives at a certain clock of S’. Or, in other words, after a given t, a clock of
S’ arrives at the origin of S. Let’s analyze this clock. Since S’ is moving with velocity v
related to S’, S is moving with velocity –v related to S’. This  means that the clock that
will  arrive,  at  time  t,  at  the  origin  of  S  is  at  x=-  v  t  when  t=0.  We  can  calculate  the

                                                       
3 To better visualize the absurd of such a conclusion we can imagine a flight from London to New York
on the Concord. Supposing the plane left London at 10:00 local time and arrived at JFK's airport five
hours later, the clocks on the airport would still read 10:00 since NY is in a different meridian. But what
sense would it make for a passenger to conclude time had stood still since the plane took of?

and x=x1=-vt we get,

The instant t2’ the same clock reads when it arrives at the origin of S is given by (5),

If instead of writing t2’-t1’ on (10) we simply write t’, then (10) is then the same as,

(11) gives us the real time that passed on the clock of S, when a given time t’ passed on
a  clock  of  S’.  (11)  is  different  from  (5).  t’  has  a  different  meaning  in  each  of  this
expressions. While in (11) t’ is the time that passed on S’, in (5) it is not. As expected,
(11) is the same as (4) - the relation between the rhythms of S and S’ doesn’t dependent
on  which  frame  of  reference  we  place  ourselves.  We  confirm  from  (11)  that  the  time
interval  set  by  a  single  clock  of  S'  is  smaller  then  that  of  a  clock  of  S.  Time  goes  by
slower for S'. S is getting older faster then S' independently of the point of view of the
observer.

It's  now  clear  that  the  Twin  Paradox  is  the  result  of  a  wrong  interpretation  of
Lorentz  Transformation.  It's  a  consequence  of 
time  with
desynchronized  clocks.  While  (2)  and  (7)  are  symmetrical  (as  are  (1)  and  (8)),  their
physical meaning is not the same.

In  order  to  establish  an  exact  relation  between  the  rhythms  of  two  moving
frames of reference, we have to know how their clocks are desynchronized. This implies
knowing their  velocities relative to rest. We can't otherwise be certain which twin will
age faster. How can we then establish such a relation?

Let's  consider  a  third  system  of  coordinates,  S'',  with  absolute  velocity  v2.  We
want  to  relate  S'  with  S''.  We  already  know  how  to  establish  the  relation  between  the
rhythms of each of the moving frames and the resting one. We know from (4) that:

(14) is the relation between the  rhythms  of  any  two  frames  with  absolute  velocities  v1
and v2. By making v2=0 we obtain the relation between a moving frame and the resting
one, which we already knew to be (12). Now, supposing the two systems of coordinates
were  moving  away  from  each  other  with  identical  absolute  velocities,  then  v1=  v2  and
from (14) we'd get:

dt =

´ dt

´´

)15(

This  means  that  when  two  twins  are  moving  away  from  each  other  with  identical
absolute velocities, they're aging at exactly the same rhythm. As if they were stopped in
relation  to  each  other.  If  one  of  this  twins  were  to  catch  up  with  the  other,  he  would
have to turn around and speed up. For a period of time his absolute velocity would have
to  be  larger  then  that  of  the  other  twin.  During  that  period  he  would  be  aging  slower
then his brother, so when he finally did reach him, he would look younger.

In conclusion, the expression (12) or (13), which within Relativity's  framework
is  used  to  relate  any  two  frames  of  reference,  doesn't  express  any  physical  meaning
unless one of the frames has a very small absolute velocity. In order to know the exact
relation between the rhythms of the clocks of two moving  frames, (14) has to be used.
This shows the rhythm of a clock depends on it's absolute velocity.

2.2 Lorentz Contraction

The  problem  with  Lorentz  Contraction  is  analogous  of  that  of  measuring  time
between  frames.  In  order  to  measure  the  size  of  a  moving  material  bar  on  a  resting
system  of  coordinates  we  need  to  localize  both  ends  of  the  bar  at  exactly  the  same
moment (Einstein, A. [1] p.128). Once we know those two positions, we can determine
the  distance  between  them  and  we'll  get the  size  of  the  bar.  But  since  the  clocks  of  a
moving system are desynchronized, how can we be sure we're looking at both ends of a
bar at exactly the same moment?

Let's  consider  a  bar  that  when  resting  related  to  any  system  of  coordinates  has
size  L  measured  on  the  x-axis  of  that  system.  Let's  suppose  the  bar  is  moving  with  S'
that has a speed v1 and that the left end of the bar, A’, is fixed on xA´=0. Since the bar is
resting related to S’, it’s right end, B’, is on x’=L. We want to know the size of the bar
as measured in S. Since the clocks of S' are desynchronized, we  must begin  by  finding
the instant marked by the clock situated on x'=L when t=0 (Fig 1). From (3) we get,

Since A’ is on x=0, (17) is exactly the size of the bar measured on S. x is smaller
then L and is a function of v1. The faster the bar is moving, the more it gets contracted.
Now let's suppose there's an identical bar fixed on S. How can we measure it's size from
the point of view of S' ?

We'll also suppose A is on x=0 and therefore B is on xB=L. S is  moving related
to  S'  so,  as  before, the only  way  to  determine  the  size  of  the  bar  on  the  S  frame  is  to
localize its ends at exactly the same time. We'll again suppose that when the left end of
the bar, A, is on x'=0, the clock that's situated on the origin of S' marks t'=0. We want to
know  where  B  is  at the  same  moment.  But  now  we  arrive  at the  problem  we've  come
upon before - the clocks of S' are desynchronized. When the clock of x'=0 marks t'=0,
the clock of S' situated next to B, marks a different instant. If we where to try to find B

-
-
-
for  t'=0,  we  wouldn't  be  localizing  it  for  the  same  moment  in  time.  We  would  be
localizing it for a later moment and so the bar would've already moved. We would find
an unreal smaller value for it's size. One way to be sure we're localizing B at exactly the
same moment is to use the clocks of the resting frame. Only that frame of reference has
synchronized clocks. Since when the clock of the origin of S' marks t'=0 the clocks of S
also mark t=0, we'll localize B' for t=0. From (6) by making x=L and t=0 we get:

Has expected the bar looks larger from the point of view of S'. The faster S' is  moving
the  larger  the  bar  of  S  will  seem  to  be.  This  only  seems  natural  since  we  had  already
seen S' is contracted because of it's velocity relative to S.

 It becomes clear that, like time, the contraction of a bar can only be determined
using the frame with synchronized clocks as reference - the resting frame. How can we
then determine the size of a moving bar on an also moving frame of reference?

Let's  suppose  we  want  to  measure  the  size  of  the  bar  of  S'  on  a  system  of
coordinates S'' moving with velocity v2. We must begin by localizing B' on S, which we
already know to be (17). Now all we need to do is localize the obtained x on S'', at the
same  moment  t=0.  Supposing  A'  is  on  x''=0,  from  (6)  (the  x´  of    (6)  is  now  x´´)
substituting x for (17) and making t=0 we get:

(19) is the size of the bar measured on any system of coordinates with velocity v2, when
the bar is moving with velocity v1. By making v2=0 we get Lorentz Contraction, which
means we're measuring the bar on the resting frame. When v1=0 the bar is fixed on the
resting system. By making v1 = - v2 or v1 = v2 the bar and the frame we’re measuring it in
are traveling with the same speed related to rest – they are equally contracted and so the
size of the bar is L.

What happens when we  localize B’ on S'' for t''=0? Since the clocks of S’’ are
also desynchronized we are localizing  it for a different moment  in time. For a given t,
the position of B’ on S is:

As B moves along S'' it finds clocks marking different values. (25) is the position of the
clock that marks t''=0 when B reaches it. Naturally by that time A has also moved. (25)
has the form of Lorentz Contraction, but as we've seen, its physical meaning is different
- (25) is not the size of the bar, it's a position of the bar's right end after  it has already
moved.

In  conclusion  Lorentz  Contraction  can  only  measure  the  size  of  a  bar  on  the
resting  frame  of  reference.  When  Lorentz  Contraction  is  established  from  any  other
frame  of  reference  it's  physical  meaning  is  not  the  same  -  since  the  clocks  of  any
moving frame of reference are not synchronized, the ends of the bar are being localized
at two different moments in time - we're not finding the bar's true size. Only when that
frame of reference  has  a  very  small  absolute  velocity  do those  values  become  similar.
We've  also  seen  that  unlike  Relativity  claims,  identical  bars  don't  see  each  other  as
looking  smaller  (Einstein,  A.  [1]  p.  138).  The  faster  bar  sees  the  other  larger  and  the
slower  one  sees  the  other  smaller.  On  the  other  hand,  we  find  that  when  two  bars  are
moving  with  symmetrical  absolute  velocities  they  notice  absolutely  no  contraction
between each other.

3.  The  inconstancy  of  the  speed  of  light  -  reinterpreting  Einstein's
definitions

Let's begin by assuming (Einstein, A. [1] p.134) the  maximum possible speed k
on the  frame of  reference  we  considered  to  be  at  rest  is  the  speed  of  light  (k=c).  This
means that if a ray of light where to leave the origin of S when t=0, it would reach x=L
at t=L/k. All the clocks of S would be marking that same instant by that moment.

How can we know the speed of that same ray of light related to a moving frame
of reference S'? Through (20) and x=kt and using Lorentz transformation it can be easily
shown that the instant t' marked by the clock of S' situated on x'=L  would  also  be  L/k
when the ray of light reached it. This is true for any velocity of S'. This could lead us to
think the speed of light is the same for every frame of reference. But we can't forget the
clocks  of  every  moving  frame  of  reference  are  desynchronized.  When  the  ray  of  light
left  x'=0 the  clock  situated  on  x'=0  marked  t'=0,  but  the  one  on  x'=L  was  marking  a
smaller value. From (3) it marked:

v
k

L

This means that (L/k-0) is not the time the ray of light takes to reach x'=L. The time  it
takes for the light to reach that point can be calculated by only  looking at the clock of

x'=L. It is the difference between its instant when the  light reaches  it and the  instant  it
marked when the light left x'=0, (27). This is what we get:

(29) is the maximum speed measured on any frame of reference with velocity v related
to rest. The  maximum speed depends on the velocity of the  frame. If  we  consider  that
the maximum speed is the speed of light, then the speed of light changes accordingly to
the speed of the frame of reference and  its direction. It's value  is k only on  the  resting
frame.  When  the  ray  of  light  is  traveling  in  the  same  direction  of  the  frame  we're
measuring it in, its speed varies between k and k/2. As assumed, on the resting frame the
speed of light is k. As the speed of the frame approaches k, the speed of the ray of light
measured on that frame, becomes k/2. When the ray of light is traveling in the opposite
direction of the frame of reference, its speed varies between k and infinity - as the speed
of  the  frame  approaches  k  the  speed  of  that  same  ray  of  light  tends  to  infinity.  This
results  leads  us  to  another  interesting  conclusion.  When  a  ray  of  light  is  first  emitted
with  the  direction  of  the  moving  frame  and  then  gets  reflected  by  a  mirror,  it  travels
until  it  reaches  the  mirror  with  one  speed  and  then  it  travels  back  in  the  opposite
direction with a different speed. We can determine its average speed since it leaves x'=0
until  it  gets  back  to  that  point.  We'll  consider  the  mirror  is  on  x'=L  when  the  light
reaches it. We already know both speeds from (29) and the duration of both routes from
(28). The average speed, where T is the total time is:

Substituting T in (30) we obtain k.

This means the average speed of a ray of light that leaves one point and then returns is
the same on every  frame of reference.  It  is  always  k.  But,  has  we've  seen,  this  doesn't
mean  the  instantaneous  speed  of  light  doesn't  vary  accordingly  to  the  speed  of  the
frame.

Einstein's  synchronization  method  depends  on  the  emission  of  a  ray  of  light.
Einstein definition [Einstein, A [1] p. 125-128] implies that a clock situated at a distance
L  from  the  point  of  emission  marks  the  value  L/k  by  the  time  light  reaches  it.  Every
clock  of  any  frame  of  reference  obeys  this  rule.  But  at  the  same  time,  Lorentz
Transformation  implies the clocks of x’=0 and x’=L are desynchronized between each
other  and, of  course,  will  continue  to  be  when  light  reaches  x’=L.  Once  we  admit  the
speed  of  light  varies  accordingly  to  the  velocity  of  a  frame,  the  reason  for  this
desynchronization  becomes  clear4.  Except 
frame,  Einstein’s
synchronization  method  doesn’t  truly  synchronize  clocks.  By  defining  speed  as  a
function of the difference  between the  instants  of  two  desynchronized  clocks,  Einstein
created a new definition of speed since that difference is not really the time  light takes
to reach the clock. We can't say this definition is wrong, but we must understand that by
using it, we will  necessarily conclude the speed of light is the same on every  frame of
reference5.  By  using  the  usual  definition  of  speed,  we  will  arrive  at  different
conclusions.  Both  definitions  can  be  used,  but  in  order  to  arrive  at  a  physical
interpretation, we must know which we're using.

resting 

the 

for 

this  apparent  paradox 

Relativity  tells  us  that  if  two  events  occur  at  the  same  time  on  one  frame  of
reference,  then  they  don’t  from  the  point  of  view  of  a  different  frame  -  what  is
simultaneous    on  one  frame  of  reference  isn’t  on  another  [Einstein,  A  [1]  p  125-130,
the
is 
138].  Again, 
desynchronization. As we’ve seen, by trying to localize a bar, “the same moment” on a
moving  frame  is  defined  by  clocks  marking  different  instants.  On  a  moving  frame,
talking about two clocks reading the same instant is talking about two events that don’t
occur at the same moment – the events are not truly simultaneous. Except for the resting
frame, the definition of simultaneity can’t depend on clocks reading the same instant.

the  result  of  not  acknowledging 

Essentially  the  problem  with  Relativity  is  one  of  interpretation.  Relativity’s
postulates  are  incompatible  with  Lorentz  Transformation.  Clocks  of  a  moving  frame
that were set using the speed of light, are not synchronized between each other. Lorentz
transformation implies that. This it self is not a problem. As long as we know precisely

                                                       
4 Accordingly to Einstein’s definition of synchronization, when a ray of light reaches a clock at distance
L, it sets the clock at t’=L/c. Of course, if the speed of light is not really c on that frame, then L/c is not
the time it takes for the light to travel the distance L. On the other hand, the clock that was reading t’=0
when the light was emitted  will read the real time the light took to reach L. The clocks will be reading
different instants.
5 “We thus see that the velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body K' is also equal to c. The
same result is obtained for rays of light advancing in any other direction whatsoever. Of course this is not
surprising, since the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point of
view.” Einstein, Albert. Relativity: The Special and General Theory. New York: Henry Holt, 1920;

how  those  clocks  are  desynchronized,  we  can  use  them  just  as  well  as  if  they  were
synchronized.  What  is  a  problem  is  not  acknowledging  that  desynchronization  and
assuming  every  frame  of  reference  has  synchronized  clocks.  Lorentz  transformation
cannot  be  used  under  that  assumption.  This  is  has  been  happening  within  Relativity.
Unless  we  understand  that  we  are  dealing  with  desynchronized  clocks  and  unless  we
have  in  mind  the  meaning  of  the  definitions  we're  using,  we're  likely  to  continue  to
make  predictions  about  the  physical  world  that  will  lead  us  to  incomprehensible
paradoxes.

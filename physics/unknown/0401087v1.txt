In the post-LEP era the high energy frontier is reachable only by large scale collaborations and laboratories, while the present 
lepton colliders operating at low and intermediate energies are planning major upgrades aimed at increasing substantially their 
luminosity, in order to meet the continuous interest in precision physics. The lowest energies are now represented by DAΦNE 
(1.02  GeV  cm,  operating  at  Frascati),  VEPP-2000  (from  1  to  2  GeV,  in  construction  at  Novosibirsk),  CESR  (presently 
operating  at  Cornell  in  the  range  between  3  to  12  GeV),  BEPC  (presently  operating  in  Beijing  in  the  range  2  to  5.6  GeV, 
foreseen  luminosity  upgrade).  A  workshop  has  been  held  to  discuss  both  the  physics  issues  and  the  strategies  and  problems 
towards  higher  luminosities  in  the  energy  range  mainly  but  not  only  between  1  and  2  GeV.  The  workshop  was  intended  to 
clarify  which  experiments  are  more  appealing  to  the  physics  community,  and  which  is  the  way  to  proceed  for  obtaining  the 
necessary luminosity.  

1.  INTRODUCTION 

3.  LOW ENERGY FACTORIES ISSUES 

 

 

The  Workshop  on  "e+e-  in  the  1-2  GeV  range:  Physics 
and  Accelerator  Prospects"  was  held  from  10th  to  13th 
September 2003 at Alghero, Sardinia [1]. It was organized 
by INFN and also sponsored as an ICFA Beam Dynamics 
Panel  Miniworkshop,  by  the  working  group  on  High 
Luminosity e+e- colliders. 

Participation  was  shared  between  Experimental  and 
Theoretical Physics and Accelerator Physics, attending the 
two different working groups on the Physics Case for the 
c.m.  energy  between  1  and  2  GeV  and  the  luminosity 
issues at these energies.  

A brief summary of the main arguments discussed in the 
workshop is here presented, with special emphasis on the 
accelerator  group  contributions.  All  the  corresponding 
references can be found in the workshop proceedings [1]. 

 

2.  PHYSICS CASE 

The  most  appealing  experiments  among  the  discussed 
physics topics are the prospects for kaon physics and tests 
of  fundamental  symmetries  through  rare  kaon  decays. 
Here the impact of a very high luminosity future Φ-factory 
was extensively discussed also in relation with present and 
future 
requested 
luminosities  are  at  least  one  order  of  magnitude  higher 
than the present DAΦNE results.  

experiments.

The 

Low energy spectroscopy and baryon form factors could 
be  investigated  in  a  new  e+e-  collider  at  the  c.m.  energy 
around  2  GeV.  Luminosity  in  the  range  of  1032cm-2sec-1 
would greatly improve the present experimental accuracy. 
In  the  field  of  hypernuclear  spectroscopy,  the  recent 
start of data taking of the FINUDA experiment at DAΦNE 
is bringing a completely new experience and fresh data. If 
operations  prove  successful  as  hoped,  there  will  be  the 
strong  case  for  asking  a  luminosity  up  to  1034cm-2sec-1  to 
start  looking  systematically  for  neutron  rich  hypernuclei, 
and to study hypernuclear transitions with the emission of 
hard  photons.  This  program  is  complementary  to  the 
JPARC facility one, under construction in JAPAN.  

 
WEP02 

The  accelerator  group  was  attended  in  majority  by  the 
DAΦNE  community,  with  some  participation  from  the 
other lepton factories. 

Status  reports  on  existing  and  in  construction  factories 
in  the  low  energy  regime  were  reported:  the  Beijing  τ-
charm, the Novosibirsk VEPP-2000, the CESR-c evolution 
and DAΦNE. 

The  energy  scaling  of  many  parameters  of 

the 
accelerator  was  a  common  argument.  Specially  all 
phenomena  dominated  by  synchrotron  radiation  and 
impedance,  and 
the  beam-beam 
interaction, have been discussed.

The  round-beam  collisions  in  VEPP-2000  are  expected 
for  the  end  of  next  year.  This  collider,  the  first  one  built 
based on the principle of colliding round beams, will show 
the feasibility of very high beam-beam tune shifts.

The  τ-charm  factory  in  Beijing  is  based  on  the 
exploitation of the present BEPC ring, which is used also 
the 
for 
construction  of  a  second  ring.  Double  symmetric  rings, 
with one Interaction Region and multibunch flat beams is 
the  design  basis  for  the  factory.  It  is  already  in  the 
construction  stage  and  the  first  beam  is  foreseen  in 2007, 
when  CESR-c  will  be  shutdown.  CESR-c,  which  is 
running  now  at  lower  energy,  has  installed  wigglers  to 
increase radiation damping and a new Interaction Region.  
DAΦNE  is  now  running  for  the  third  experiment, 
FINUDA;  at  the  workshop  the  modifications  done  to  the 
ring in order to install the experiment, plus the shimming 
of  the  wiggler  poles  in  order  to  optimize  the  sextupolar 
components and the dynamic aperture were presented. The 
original physics program of DAΦNE should be completed 
in 2-3 years and it was discussed which future is expected 
for the collider. Two possibilities are envisaged: transform 
the collider in a light–quark factory doubling its energy or 
upgrade it to a super-regime factory with luminosity of at 
least  1034cm-2sec-1.  This  second  possibility,  much  more 
appealing  for  its  challenge  and  interest  was  the  main 
argument of the accelerator working group.

4.  DAFNE2 

One of the possible upgrades of DAΦNE is the increase 
in energy by at least a factor 2. The energy increase needs 
changes  of  some  of  the  present  systems:  essentially  the 
dipoles,  the  Interaction  Region  and  the  injection.  All  the 
other  systems,  RF,  feedback,  vacuum,  quadrupoles, 
sextupoles,  correction  coils,  diagnostics,  are  already 
dimensioned  for 
the  higher  energy.  The  requested 
luminosity  is  similar  to  the  one  already  achieved  in 
DAΦNE at the lowest energy, 1032 cm-2sec-1. The project 
for  this  upgrade  is  named  DAFNE2,  where  the  ‘F’  stays 
for Frascati and the ‘2’ for the c.m. energy in GeV. 

The  dipole  preliminary  designs,  fitting  the  present 
vacuum chambers, are based on the use of two materials, 
steel  and  permendur.  This  last  one,  having  a  higher 
saturation  field,  will  be  used  on  the  pole  in  order  to 
increase  the  magnetic  field  on  the  beam  axis,  up  to  the 
necessary 2.2 T.  

The  luminosity  requirements  can  be  achieved  with  a 
total  current  of  0.5  A  in  30  bunches.  The  corresponding 
beam-beam  tune  shifts  are  ξx  /  ξy  =  0.014  /  0.024,  below 
the limit already achieved in DAΦNE.  

The  IR  design,  based  on  the  same  principles  of  the 
present  DAΦNE  ones,  could  use  superconducting 
quadrupoles very similar to those presented by the CESR 
group. 

Two possibilities are being considered for the injection: 
a  Linac  upgrade  to  1 GeV for on-energy  injection, or  the 
collider  ramping,  the  first  one  optimizes  the  average 
luminosity, while the second one optimizes the costs.   

5.  DAΦNE-II 

The  DAΦNE  group  has  presented  some  different 
options  for  the  very  high  luminosity  regime  at  the  Φ-
energy.  

One is based on the exploitation of collisions of higher 
energy  rings  with  a  very  large  crossing  angle,  with  the 
advantage of simplifying all the single ring challenges for 
low-energy/high-currents regimes. The design of a specific 
detector  for  the  boosted  production  of  collisions  presents 
some disadvantages with respect to the non-boosted case, 
and since the luminosity reachable with this scheme is also 
affected  by  the  geometrical  reduction  due  to  the  crossing 
angle, the idea has not been further investigated. 

The  second  option,  on  which  a  preliminary  conceptual 
design has been presented named DAΦNE-II, is based on 
the  strong  RF  focusing  principle,  very  high  radiation 
emission  and  negative  momentum  compaction  ring 
configuration. 

The  strong  RF  focusing  is  a  modulation  of  the  bunch 
length along the ring, obtained by a very large longitudinal 
phase advance, corresponding to synchrotron tune near the 
half  integer.  The  minimum  of  the  bunch  length  occurs  at 
the  IP,  while  the  maximum  occurs  at  the  RF  cavity 
position.  Such  a  scheme  needs  a  large  absolute  value  of 
the momentum compaction and a high RF voltage, and the 
 
WEP02 

ring  acts  as  a  magnetic  compressor.  The  high  radiation 
emission  is  obtained  with  a  lattice  based  on  cells  with 
positive  and  negative dipoles,  in  which  the damping  time 
is of the order of few msec, about a factor 5 less than the 
present DAΦNE one.  

The  dispersion  self  solution  oscillates  around  zero  and 
in  each  dipole  has  the  sign  opposite  to  the  bending  angle 
and  has  a  high  value,  so  that  its  contribution  to  the 
momentum  compaction  is  always  negative  and  high, 
almost  an  order  of  magnitude  with  respect  to  the  present 
DAΦNE one. The advantages of the negative momentum 
compaction regime, like shorter bunches, and more regular 
bunch shape are therefore included in the design.  

An RF system at 500 MHz, with voltage of the order of 
10 MV, for a 100m long ring, and momentum compaction 
near -0.2, will give bunch lengths at the IP near 2 mm. 

The  Interaction  Region  fitting  the  existing  KLOE 
detector is based on low-beta quadrupoles very close to the 
Interaction  Point,  to  focus  the  vertical  beta  to  few 
millimeters. 

Considerations  on  beam  lifetime,  background,  and 
dynamic aperture are in the preliminary stage. A design for 
the normal conducting dipoles at 1.8T was presented.  

A  preliminary  configuration  of  the  feedback  system  in 
the  regime  of  very  high  synchrotron  frequency,  based  on 
GPboards, was also presented by the PEP-II participants. 

Figures  1  and  2  show  the  betatron  functions  and  the 

dispersion function respectively along the ring.

Figure 3 - DAΦNE-II Bunch length along the ring  
 

The  bunch  length  modulation  is  shown  in  figure  3,  for 
the  set  of  the  collider  parameters  listed  in  Table  I.  These 
are  one  of  the  possible  combinations  which  on  paper 
corresponds  to  values  of  luminosity  of  the  order  of  1034 
cm-2 sec-1. 

The  collider  layout  fits  the  existing  DAΦNE  hall  (see 
fig.4) and could utilize all existing infrastructures and sub-
systems.  The  collider  will  have  only  one  Interaction 
Region,  while  the  opposite  section  will  be  used  for  the 
injection  and  the  RF  system.  The  elements  introducing 
impedance  should  be  placed  in  the  sections  where  the 
bunch  length  is  longer,  so  that  perturbation  to  the  bunch 
distribution is minimized.

6.  CONCLUSIONS 

Physics  measurement  in  the  1-2  GeV  range  will  be 
competitive  in  next  decade,  provided  that  luminosity 
increases  by  at  least  one  order  of  magnitude  with  respect 
to what has been obtained up to now. 

The overview of e+e- colliders in the low energy range 
stressed that the evolution of already assessed principles is 
the  next future  of  many  of  the  present  factories  (BEPCII, 
CESRc, DAFNE). There is expectation for the first round 
colliding beams at VEPP2000.  

tested, 

New  ideas  for  increasing  the  luminosity  are  being 
already 
i.e.  negative  momentum  compaction. 
Others  are  being  investigated,  and  one  of  the  more 
interesting is the strong RF focusing, which leads to very 
challenging collider designs.

DAΦNE hall 
 

Since  the  foreseen  lifetime  at  the  very  high  luminosity 
regime is few minutes, an upgrade of the injection system 
allowing continuous injection has been defined, in order to 
increase  the  average  luminosity,.  It  is  based  on  the 
doubling  of  the  transfer  lines  between  the  damping  ring 
and  the  collider,  while  presently  the  only  existing  line  is 
shared by both beams, which increases the necessary time 
for injection.

ABSTRACT: 

We analyse a mechanical system in two-dimensional relative motion with friction. Although 
the system is simple, the peculiar interplay between two kinetic friction forces and gravity 
leads to the wide range of admissible solutions exceeding most intuitive expectations. In 
particular, the strong qualitative dependence between behaviour of the system, boundary 
conditions and parameters involved in its description is emphasised. The problem is intended 
to be discussed in theoretical framework and might be of interest for physics and mechanics 
students as well as for physics teachers.

1.  INTRODUCTION  

Friction forces make a part of elementary course of dynamics. Usually one states that  
the direction of the kinetic friction force acting on a given object is opposite to the direction 
of its motion and the magnitude of friction force is given as F = f N, where N is a normal 
reaction force acting on the object and f is the coefficient of kinetic friction. Authors of physics 
textbooks very seldom emphasize that the direction of friction is always antiparallel  
to the relative velocity of two rubbing surfaces. Almost all examples of motion with friction 
we meet in college and even in university physics textbooks do not show the importance  
of the above-mentioned fact. 
This paper describes behaviour of a simple mechanical system which should draw students’ 
attention to the issue of relative motion of surfaces with friction. 
Let us consider a mechanical system shown in details in Fig. 1. A block B of mass m is put on 
the plane σ moving with constant velocity uH  parallel to its surface (like a belt conveyor).  
The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface of plane is given as f1>0. 
An additional vertical rough wall W is put across and slightly above the moving plane to forbid 
the motion of the block in  uH  direction. The surface of plane is inclined to the horizontal with 
an angle 0< α <π/2 in such a way that block B can slide down along the wall W (see Fig. 1). 
The coefficient of kinetic friction between the wall W and the block B is assumed f2>0.  
The whole system is in the uniform, vertical gravity field  gH , which is the source of motion  
for B against the wall.

Most students and even experienced physicists asked about how this system will behave 
answer instinctively without calculations that B will constantly accelerate if it is only able  
to start to move on its own, due to gravity, at some initial moment t = 0. Such expectation 
seems to be very natural but is it really the case here? We will show this expectation is 
completely unjustified and that the real behaviour of our mechanical system may, in general, 
seriously contradict the common sense point of view. Moreover, the particular choice of values  
for f1, f2, and α parameters may be the source of chaotic motion for B.  
The essential role in proper description of this problem is played by the kinetic friction force [1]. 
As we already mentioned its direction is always antiparallel to the relative velocity of two 

rubbing surfaces*.The interplay between two kinetic friction forces present in the system, and 
described below, leads to amazing motion of the block B we analyse theoretically  
in this paper. 

2.  THE DYNAMICAL SYSTEM AND ITS EQUATION OF MOTION 

Let us introduce the system of coordinates OXY in such a way that OY axis is perpendicular  
to the wall W and OX axis lies in the plane σ  (see Fig.1). The relative velocity 
against the plane is shown in Fig.2a.

Thus we have: 

   
where v is the linear velocity of the block along W.  
Following this consideration we find components of kinetic friction force TH  between B and σ 
(see Fig. 2b):

* In some physics textbooks (see e.g.[2]) the direction of kinetic friction force is simply defined 
as antiparallel to the velocity of moving object. Such definition is obviously incorrect because 
it does not make Newton laws of dynamics invariant for various inertial systems of reference. 
Indeed,  if  we  change  the  reference  system,  the  velocity  (its  direction  and  magnitude)  also 
changes. However, kinetic friction force and any other force involved must remain unchanged. 
Otherwise, the second Newton’s law would be obviously broken.

It is worth to notice from (7) that if the initial velocity of B is v0 ≡v(t= 0) =0 then the block is 
able to start to move (i.e. a(t = 0) > 0) only when x2 < 1.  
Contrary, the block rests all the time against the wall only if x2 ≥1. Indeed, in this case we have 
from (6):

where FT is the static friction force between B and W limited by its maximal value:

Combination of Eqs(11), (12) and (4) provides the required condition x2 ≥1.  
It is interesting to look at the description of motion of this system in matrix form what we do in 
Appendix. 
 
3.  DISCUSSION OF SOLUTIONS 
The subject of further analysis is the non-linear differential equation given in Eq. (7).  
The detailed analytical solution of this equation is troublesome and it is much more convenient 
to solve it numerically. However, basic properties of admissible solutions can be found very 
easy at elementary mathematics level. In this paper we will additionally use the simple Euler’s 
method [3] which is stable for the considered case to illustrate qualitatively these solutions. 
We see from the form of Eq.(7) that 
if the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq.(7) satisfies  
the condition: 
 
(13) 
For positive v(t), u, x1, x2, it is equivalent to the square inequality with respect to v(t):

Let us first discuss the case x2 <1. It is already seen that the list of admissible solutions in this 
case may significantly exceed our naive expectations. Here we meet three possibilities for x1 to 
be analysed: x1 >1, x1 <1 and x1 =1. The RHS of Eq.(7) versus v(t) is plotted for these 
possibilities in Fig. 3a. We discuss them in following subsections.

The range of (x1, x2) parameters involved in these solutions is shown in Fig. 4a. 
From Eq.(15) we have ∆ > 0 and therefore two distinct real roots of inequality (13) (and also 
those of RHS of Eq.(7)) exist:

3.2. SOLUTIONS FOR X1<1. 
Here ∆ can be either positive or negative (see Eq. 15). Thus several options are to be discussed: 
∆<0 , ∆>0 and ∆=0. This is what we do below: 
3.2.1.  THE OPTION ∆<0 
The domain of (x1, x2) parameters satisfying this condition is shown in Fig.5a.  
The RHS of Eq.(7) has no roots and therefore, according to (14), is positive for all v(t)≥0.  
It means that the block accelerates independently on its initial velocity. Our intuition indicates 
this possibility as the (cid:147)most natural(cid:148). We present integral curves for this option in Fig.5b.

3.2.2.  THE OPTION ∆>0 
The area in (x1, x2) plane corresponding to this criterion is shown in Fig.6a. The RHS of Eq.(7) 
is null for v± already given in Eq.(16). One easy checks that:

It means that v(t) = v_ is the stationary and stable solution of Eq(7) while v(t) = v+ is unstable, 
i.e. any infinitesimal increase of the initial or instant velocity above v+ (or infinitesimal change 
in friction coefficients f1, f2 - what may always occur locally) leads to contrary different 
behaviour of the system  than if this velocity is slightly below v+. The situation is clarified with 
integral curves in Fig.6b. This diagram shows the possibility of chaotic motion of the block 
around v+ for x1<1, x2<1, 
qualitative dependence between the solution of differential equation and the boundary 
condition (or parameters of considered equation) [5].

Thus vs is the stable and stationary solution and the system evolves regularly (similarly to  
the case x1>1) with integral curves plotted already in Fig.4b. 
 
3.4. SOLUTIONS FOR X2 ≥ 1 
Here we deal with the range of parameters shown in Figs. 8a, 9a. If x2 ≥1 the block is unable to 
start from the rest itself. Nevertheless the instant external action can force it to do so  
(see the previous section). What happens then?  
If v0 >0 we are still eligible to use Eq.(7). The discriminant ∆ given in Eq.(15) is obviously 
nonnegative for x2 ≥1 and two roots of RHS of Eq.(7) are produced, given by Eq.(16). Using 
the same procedure as before it is easy to verify they are both negative for

Contrary, for x1 <1, relations v+ >0 and  v_ <0 hold (v_ < 0 because for x1 <1 and x2>1 the 
dv
inequality (17) is satisfied). Hence the inequality (15) also holds for any v(t)>v+ so that

 for v(t)>v+ (see Fig. 3b). It means that our block will accelerate if its 

for 0≤v(t)<v+ and 
initial velocity v0>v+ and will decelerate until stopping if v0<v+. The integral curves for this 
case are plotted in Fig. 9b. The behaviour around v+ can be chaotic again because v(t)=v+ is the 
stationary but unstable solution of Eq.(7).

4. CONCLUSIONS 
In this article we have made a theoretical analysis of the evolution of a simple mechanical 
system, where the interplay between two dependent kinetic friction forces and gravity leads in 
same cases to interesting and unexpected results. Unexpected (cid:150) in the sense that our intuition 
tells us the system should evolve differently than it really does. This phenomenon occurs for 
the particular choice of parameters x1, x2 describing the system and reflects the non-linearity of 

 

9

its differential equation of motion. In fact the shape of solutions depends only on the slope α 
and two coefficients of friction f1, f2. 
The variety of obtained solutions makes considered toy-system an interesting theoretical 
exercise which explains how far a deep understanding of simple physical idea (e.g. kinetic 
friction force) is important in qualitative description of the system. 
The space of physically admissible parameters x1≥0, x2≥0 may be divided into several 
subdomains as shown in Fig.10a. They can also be translated into (f1, f2) plot where they look 
like in Fig. 10b. Each subdomain has been analysed separately in the former section. 
Corresponding sets of integral curves for velocity v(t) have been drawn in Figs. 4b-9b, while 
dv  plot against v(t) is shown in Figs. 3a, 3b. 
dt
The behaviour of the system is quite regular in subdomains (i), (ii), (v) (see Fig. 10). It means 
that v(t) has the similar property independently on initial conditions (initial velocity).

The notation in subdomains corresponds to the sequence of discussion in the text.  
(b) The space of physically admissible friction coefficients corresponding to these subdomains 
drawn for particular choice of s parameter (α = π/12). The hatched area corresponds to 
parameter range where unstable solutions of equation of motion exist. 
 
 
However this situation changes drastically in remaining subdomains represented as hatched 
area in Fig. 10. In that case the shape of solutions and their properties (see Figs. 6b, 7b, 9b) are 
very sensitive to initial conditions of motion (velocity above or below v+) where v+ is given in 
Eq.(16) or in explicite form as: 
)
=

 
For v = v+ ± ε (ε → 0) there is a strong qualitative dependence of the solution from the local 
values of f1, f2 and α involved in v+ determination. Any infinitesimal change in these 
parameters makes the further motion of the block qualitatively different. Since then the 
evolution is difficult to be predicted. It is known that such phenomenon may be the source of 
chaotic behaviour of the dynamical system. Basically it reflects the non-linearity of differential 
equation involved in the description of the process.

Let us finally notice that all discussed cases seem to be realistic. This is shown explicite in 
Fig. 10b where considered subdomains are plotted in (f1, f2) plane as the example for α= π/12. 
It is clear that the values of f1 and f2 are accessed for the wide class of materials and therefore 
we hope that a real model like the one considered can be built to visualise properties discussed 
here theoretically. 
 
 
APPENDIX 
One dimensional motion of mass m in OX direction under the action of net external force Fext 
and a friction force T=fN, where f is the coefficient of kinetic friction and N-  the normal 
reaction force from the surface (OX-line), is described by known formula

The case discussed in this paper has however two surfaces involved. Therefore there are two 
different reaction forces causing friction. Two dimensional motion  (in OXY reference frame) 
may be described by simple generalization of the formula (A1) in the following way:

Nondiagonal form of F and its dependence on velocity (via dependence on ψ) is the source for 
variety of qualitatively different solutions discussed throughout this paper. Similarity between 
(A2) and (A1) is the quickest alternative way to explain why the system is so mysterious. 
Solutions of one dimensional case (A1) would also look differently if dependence of friction 
coefficient f on velocity v was assumed.

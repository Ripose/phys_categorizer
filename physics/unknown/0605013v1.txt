Abstract. We point out that the claims in the comment-paper of Scheuer and Yariv are either irrelevant or incorrect.
The idealized  Kirchoff-loop-Johnson-like-noise  (KLJN)  scheme  is  totally  secure  therefore  it  is  more  secure  than
idealized  quantum  communication  schemes  which  can  never  be  totally  secure  because  of  the  inherent  noise
processes  in  those  communication  schemes  and  the  statistical  nature  of  eavesdropper  detection  based  on  error
statistics.  On  the  other  hand,  with  sufficient  resources,  a  practical/non-ideal  realization  of  the  KLJN  cipher  can
arbitrarily approach the idealized limit and outperform even the idealized quantum communicator schemes because
the non-ideality-effects are determined and controlled by the design. The cable resistance issue analyzed by Scheuer
and Yariv is a good example for that because the eavesdropper has insufficient time window to build a sufficient
statistics and the actual information leak can be designed. We show that Scheuer's and Yariv's numerical result of
1%  voltage  drop  supports  higher  security  than  that  of  quantum  communicators.  Moreover,  choosing  thicker  or
shorter  wires  can  arbitrarily  reduce  this  voltage  drop  further;  the  same  conclusion  holds  even  according  to  the
equations of Scheuer and Yariv.

The comment-paper by Scheuer and Yariv (Sch-Y) [1,2] attempts to show that the Kirchhoff-
loop-Johnson-noise  (KLJN) [2-8] classical communicator has limited security. Clarification of
the issues of real security is indeed important especially because the KLJN system has recently
became network-ready [6]. This new property [6] opens a large scale of practical applications
because the KLJN cipher can be installed as a computer card [6], similarly to Eternet cards.

In  this  response,  we  focus  on  the  most  significant  issues  but  additional  arguments  have  been
published in [9].  Sch-Y [1,2] claim that the first KLJN paper [3] has basic flaws and that the
KLJN  cipher  is  not  secure.  However,  their  arguments  are  incorrect  and/or  irrelevant  [9],  or
already  published  [8].  Because  these  kind  of  mistaken  claims  about  the  security  of  physical
secure layers arise due to mixing requirements of idealized cipher schemes with practical design
issues, first we clarify what do idealized and practical security mean. We have recently published
similar considerations in the paper about the natural immunity of the KLJN cipher against the
man-in-the-middle attack [5]. Work is in hand about the mathematical analysis of the practical
security and design aspects of the KLJN cipher [7]. In our response below we shall use some
preliminary results of [7].

First of all, let us consider what idealized (theoretical) total security and practical total security
of physical secure layers mean.

i) Total security of the idealized model [4]. This holds when mathematical model of the idealized
physical system shows an unconditional security. It means that the eavesdropper can extract zero
information  within  the  mathematical  framework  of  the  model;  or  if  she  is  able  to  extract
information, she disturbs the channel and she will be discovered. The KLJN cipher satisfies these
conditions: in the exact mathematical model, the passive eavesdropper extracts zero information
and  the  invasive  eavesdropper  extracts  one  bit  of  information  until  the  eavesdropping  is
discovered [3,4].

ii)  Total  security  of  the  practical  situation  [4].  Since  a  real  physical  system  is  always  more
complex  than  idealized  mathematical  models,  no  practical  system  can  be  totally  secure.  For
example, regarding quantum communication, ideal single-photon-source, noise-free channel and
noise-free detectors do not exist and any of these non-idealities compromise total security. Still,
we can talk about total practical security if the security can arbitrarily be increased by unlimited
investment  in  the  enhancement  of  the  system.  For  example,  the  wire  resistance  in  the  KLJN
system is also a non-ideality factor [8] however it can be arbitrarily reduced by using ticker wires
or shorter connections, see below.

iii) Information leak of idealized and practical situations. In idealized quantum communication
systems, information of the order of a few % of the number of transmitted bits can be extracted,
for  example  if  the  eavesdropper  randomly  extracts  a  small  fraction  of  photons  [11,12],  clone
them (with ~70% fidelity), sends one photon back to the channel, and extracts the information
from the remaining photon. This process will cause only a negligible change of the error rate in
the  channel  so  the  quantum  eavesdropper  detection  methods  will  not  be  able  to  detect  the
eavesdropping [10-12]. For that reason practical quantum communicators [12] must use privacy
amplification  technique  [10-12],  which  is  a  software-based  tool,  extracting  a  short  key  with
guaranteed negligible information leak from a long key with possibly strong information leak.
Because the privacy amplification can be used in any secure communication system with any
raw  key,  the  fair  comparison  of  the  information  leak  of  physical-secure-layer-type
communicators requires the comparison of the information leaks of the raw bits. We will show
that  KLJN  cipher's  information  leak  can  easily  be  much  less  than  that  of  idealized  quantum
communicators  and  this  claim  is  supported  even  by  Sch-Y's  results  when  we  analyze  their
implications. Now, let us deal with the main claims of Sch-Y in their comment paper.

1. In the first section Sch-Y state that our analysis in [3] "contains  a  basic  flaw" because "it
completely ignores the finite propagation time" between the sender and receiver. This statement
is incorrect. The analysis in [3] is carried out in the so-called quasi-static  limit of Maxwellian
electrodynamics guaranteeing that the voltage and current along a wire are constant and that
excludes any propagation delay effects. This is expressed by Eq. (9) in [3] and the related text:

  fmaxL << c

(1)

where  fmax   is  the  highest  frequency  component  of  the  voltage  and  current  and  L  is  the  cable
length (range of communication). This equation implies not only a necessary condition for the
security  but  also  the  necessary  condition  that  our  Kirchoff-loop  circuit  model,  the  idealized
mathematical  model  of  the  cipher,  holds  because  this  condition  is  the  base  of  the  theory
electronic circuits with discrete components. With this criticism, Sch-Y have missed to realize
that the high-frequency limit posed by Eq. (1) in the frequency domain is equivalent to the quasi-
static limit in the time domain. Transformation of limits between the time and frequency domain
are basic and well-known tools due to Fourier-theory so the reader was supposed to have and
imply this knowledge.

2. In Section 2, Sch-Y analyze the limit of high-frequency bandwidth (short correlation time) of
noise. This limit was excluded in [3] by the Eq. (1) shown above because then the KLJN cipher
naturally fails to function; therefore Sch-Y's analysis is irrelevant for [3]. Fortunately, Sch-Y also
arrive  at  the  same  conclusion  that  the  KLJN  cipher  is  useless  in  this  limit,  thus  there  is  no
contradiction between Sch-Y [1,2] and [3] in this respect.

3. At the beginning of Section 3 of [1,2], Sch-Y claim rightly that if the ciphers use fast switches
then propagation time effects will still occur, even with low-frequency noise, and the cipher will
be non-secure. Though it is correct, this claim is again irrelevant because due to Fourier-theory,

2

it violates directly Eq. (1) shown above, so this situation was excluded in [3]. As it is well-known
and mentioned above, short time scale and fast time processes in the time domain correspond to
high frequency scale and high frequency components in the frequency domain consequently fast
switching and their transients produce high-frequency components in the channel. Therefore, a
practical realization of the KLJN cipher will naturally need line filters, which are low-pass filters
at the two ends of the line [4], see Figure 1. This is also necessary to defend against possible
attacks by high-frequency probing signals. Of course, these are all practical realization problems
[4,7] and as such they were out of the scope of [3].

4. Finally, in the rest of Section 3 of [1,2], Sch-Y analyze the practical problem of non-zero wire
resistance. Note, this security problem was first pointed out by Janos Bergou [8]. At certain wire
length  and  specific  resistance,  their  numerical  results  for  the  relative  difference  of  the  mean-
square (MS) voltages at the two ends of the line, in the case of secure bit exchange, is 1%. Then
Sch-Y  claim  that  this  1%  drop  of  the  MS  voltage  "can  easily  be  detected  and  allow  Eve  to
determine Alice and Bob’s selection of resistors".  Though  we  accept  the  1%  drop  of  the  MS
voltage as a realistic practical goal [7] we disagree with Sch-Y's claim that the eavesdropper can
easily detect this 1% drop.

results are summarized in Figure 2. Note, only the relative positions and the shape of the curves
have meaning, not the actual x and y values. During the clock period, the time is enough only for
a  few  statistically  independent  samples  of  these  distribution  functions  due  to  Eq.  (2).  This
sampling is enough for the sender and receiver (left figure) to decide between the two functions
with  0.3%  error  rate  [7].  However  the  eavesdropper,  who  measures  the  voltage  drop  (right
figure), has to decide between the two situations by sampling the f(x) and g(x) density functions
given  in  the  right  figure  and  that  must  be  done  with  the  same  small  number  of  independent
samples.  The characteristics  width (standard deviation) of these curves (20% of the peak's x
coordinate) is 20 times greater than the difference of the locations of the x coordinates of the
peaks (1%). The eavesdropper's task seems to be hopeless by the naked eye however, by using
proper  statistical  tools,  she  can  still  extract  some  information.  A  deeper  analysis  based  on
Shannon's channel coding theorem [7] concludes that in this case the upper limit of information
leak is 0.7% of the transmitted bits. This is close to but less than the information leak of quantum
communicators without privacy amplifier software (see above). Thus Sch-Y's 1% drop of the MS
voltage yields a lower information leak than that of quantum communicators.

To illustrate how the security can arbitrarily be increased, let us suppose that we increase the
wire diameter by a factor of 10. Then, according to Sch-Y's Eq. (12), the relative voltage drop
will decrease by a factor of 100 which makes the difference of the location of the x coordinates
of  the  peaks  100  times  less  than  it  is  presently  in  the  right  section  of  Figure  2.  This  is  an
impressive improvement making it virtually impossible for the eavesdropper to extract useful
information. These considerations illustrate why the KLJN cipher can be designed so that its
practical realization is much closer to the limit of unconditional security than even the idealized
quantum communicators.

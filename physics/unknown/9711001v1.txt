Abstract

We construct two quantum spin chains Hamiltonians with quantum sl(1|2) invari-
ance. These spin chains deﬁne variants of the Hubbard model and describe electron mod-
els with pair hoppings. A trilinear algebra that admits the Birman–Wenzl–Murakami
algebra as a quotient allows exact solvability of the periodic chain. The two Hamiltoni-
ans, respectively built using the distinguished and the fermionic bases of Uq(sl(2)) diﬀer
only in the boundary terms. They are actually equivalent, but the equivalence is non
local. Reﬂection equations are solved to get exact solvability on open chains with non
trivial boundary conditions. Two families of diagonal solutions are found. The centre
and the Scasimirs of the quantum enveloping algebra of sl(1|2) appear as tools for the
construction of exactly solvable Hamiltonians.

1 Introduction

Since a few years, there is a considerable interest about some models of strongly correlated
electrons, in particular those of the families of the t–J model and of the Hubbard model.
The reason is that they exhibit some very interesting physical properties related with high
Tc superconductivity. Among these models, some have the property of supersymmetry, or
quantum supersymmetry. This is the case for some generalisations of the t–J model. It is also
the case for some variants of the Hubbard models in which a pair hopping term is included
([1, 2, 3] and [4] for quantum supersymmetry).

The aim of this paper is to present the construction of two variants of the supersymmetric
Hubbard model with pair hoppings, to describe the algebra that ensures their integrability
and to solve the reﬂection equations which lead to integrable boundary terms.

From the expression of the series of Casimir operators Cp of Uq(sl(2|1)), we derive quantum

spin chain Hamiltonians H with built-in Uq(sl(2|1)) invariance:

H =

1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ (ρ ⊗ ρ)∆(Pol{Cp})

⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 .

An ingredient of the construction is the knowledge of a series of Casimir operators of the
quantum algebra. We will also see that the knowledge of Scasimirs (given in section 2) leads
to some exactly solvable Hamiltonians.

}

Another ingredient of the construction is the four dimensional one parameter typical rep-
resentation ρ of Uq(sl(2|1)), so that the Hamiltonian describes a four states per site spin chain
with two parameters (the parameter of the representation together with the deformation pa-
rameter q).

The integrability of the closed chain is based on the algebra

This algebra was proved in [5] to be suﬃcient to construct a solution ˇR(u) of the Yang–
Baxter algebra (see below (45)). Moreover, the Birman–Wenzl–Murakami algebra [6, 7] is a
quotient of this algebra. Our realisation of the algebra (2–5) actually does not satisfy the
supplementary relations of the BWM algebra. The operators bi enters in the expression of the
two site Hamiltonian as

Hi,i+1 = bi − b−1

.

A remarkable fact is that, using the distinguished and fermionic bases of Uq(sl(2|1)), we
obtain two diﬀerent Hamiltonians, the diﬀerence being in the boundary terms. The same phe-
nomenon was described in [8] with three state per site spin chains (deformed supersymmetric

t–J model). These Hamiltonians are actually equivalent on open chains, but this equivalence,
which comes from a Reshetikhin twist, is non trivial since it is non local on the chain.

One of the Hamiltonians (constructed with the distinguished basis) was known to be

parameter R-matrix of Uq(sl(2|1)).

The reﬂection equations associated with the solution ˇR(u) of the Yang–Baxter algebra are
solved for diagonal K matrices. Two families of one parameter solutions are found for each
equation, leading to four possible boundary terms for exactly solvable open chain Hamiltoni-
ans. This number of solution is the same as found in [10] in the case of the supersymmetric
t–J model.
It is then shown that a special choice of these boundary terms is exactly the
diﬀerence of the two Hamiltonians built from the distinguished and the fermionic bases.

In the Appendix, the expressions of the Scasimir operators of the (non quantised) sl(2|1)

superalgebra are given.

This work was already completed when the paper [11] appeared. In this paper, the Hamil-
tonian (67) corresponding distinguished basis is studied. One of the solutions (i.e. 74) for the
reﬂection equations is given and the corresponding integrable boundary terms are computed.
The Bethe ansatz equations are also written.

In the enveloping algebra Uq(sl(2|1)), there are two abelian subalgebras A(+) and A(−), gen-
erated respectively by the operators Q(+) and Q(−). They are such that

∀x+ ∈ A(+),

∀x− ∈ A(−),

x+x− = x−x+ = 0 .

The elements Q(±) allow us to build generators of the centre of Uq(sl(2|1)), and also a set

of Scasimirs: if we deﬁne, for p ∈ Z

2.3 Four dimensional representation

We use the one-parameter four-dimensional representation, acting on the vector space V of
dimension 4, and deﬁned (in the distinguished basis) by

ρ(e1) = −ωqE23
ρ(e2) = (λ − λ−1)E12 + (qλ − q−1λ−1)E34
ρ(f1) = −q−1E32
ρ(f2) = E21 + E43
ρ(k1) = λ−1
ρ(k2) = ωλ−2
(cid:0)

E11 + q−1E22 + q−1E33 + q−2E44

(cid:1)

where ω = ±1 is a discrete parameter that allows two diﬀerent (inequivalent) representations
for each value of the continuous parameter λ ≡ qµ [12]. The discrete parameter ω is a remnant
of the quantisation of the value of k1 on the highest weight vector in ﬁnite dimension.

The Eij are the standard elementary matrices of End(V ) given by

(Eij)kl = δikδjl .

(29)

The operators are represented by ordinary matrices, with complex (commuting) elements. We
do not consider supermatrices. The traces are not supertraces. Tensor products of represen-
tations are non-graded tensor products. We indeed use, as in [8], the non-graded coproduct
deﬁned from the usual graded one as (in Sweedler’s notation)

∆n.g.(x) =

x(1)gdeg(x(2)) ⊗ x(2)

where

∆(x) =

x(1) ⊗ x(2) .

(30)

X

This is nothing but a Jordan–Wigner transformation. Practically, on tensor products of
representations, this amounts to the use of the graded coproduct ∆, the evaluation of the
representations ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 and then application of the transformation

X

Eij ⊗ Ekl −→ (−1)deg(j)(deg(k)+deg(l))Eij ⊗ Ekl ,

(31)

with deg(1) = deg(4) = 0 and deg(2) = deg(3) = 1. In the following, this will be implicitly
included in the construction. This use of ordinary matrices and non graded coproduct is
actually equivalent to the standard procedure, and leads to the same conclusions. It is however
sometimes simpler in actual computations.

The transformation from ∆ to the non-graded ∆n.g. was used by Majid to bosonise super
Hopf algebras [14]. It is a simple case of transmutation. A transformation was also deﬁned
in [15] and applied to the R-matrix, which allowed to consider non-graded Yang–Baxter
equations.

,

+q4p−2[2µ + 1][2µ + 2]O2

(cid:0)

where the expression of the operators Oa is given later in Equation (44).

(cid:1)

The operators Oa satisfy the relations

OaOb = δa,bOa

O0 + O1 + O2 = Id .

(32)

(33)

The operators O0, O1, O2 are actually projectors on the representations of dimension 4, 8

and 4, respectively, that enter in the decomposition of the tensor product ρ ⊗ ρ (using ∆).

Inverting (32) allows to express these projectors directly in terms of evaluations on the

tensor product ρ ⊗ ρ of some Casimir operators Cp:

O0 =

q4λ−8p−4
[2µ][2µ + 1](q4 − 1)(q2 − 1)

,

(cid:1)

(cid:1)
(34)

where, again, λ = qµ.

As a consequence of (33), the algebra generated by all the Uq(sl(2|1)) invariant operators
(ρ ⊗ ρ)∆(Cp) is Vect(O0, O1, O2) = Vect(Id, O0, O2) ⊂ End(V ⊗ V ). Within this algebra, we
look for operators b satisfying the braid group relations

bibi±1bi = bi±1bibi±1 ,
for

bibj = bjbi

|i − j| ≥ 2 ,

where

bi ≡ bi,i+1 = 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ b ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 ,

in which b occupies positions i, i + 1.

We ﬁnd two non trivial solutions to these equations, given by

b = −qId + qλ

[2µ]
[µ]

O0 + λ−1 [2µ + 2]

the other one being its inverse b−1.

(39)

These are the only solutions for generic λ = qµ. For particular values of λ, i.e. λ = ±q−1/2 for
instance, there are other solutions to the braid relations, which can lead to Temperley–Lieb
algebra [16].

We deﬁne x = (λ − λ−1)(qλ − q−1λ−1), and y = ([µ][µ + 1])1/2 = x1/2/(q − q−1) including

the freedom for a sign in y.

The explicit expressions for b and b−1 are

a linear combination of b and b−1 that is solution of the Yang–Baxter algebra (Baxterisation).

The algebra satisﬁed by the operators bi is then given by (2-5). It is suﬃcient to deﬁne an
exactly solvable periodic spin chain. This algebra was already used in [5] to obtain solutions

It has PT symmetry:

R21(u) ≡ PR12(u)P = R12(u)t1t2 .

With periodic boundary conditions, this Hamiltonian also commutes with all the transfer
matrices, which is the requirement for its exact solvability. The Hamiltonian with ordinary
periodic boundary conditions is however not Uq(sl(2|1))-invariant. A method was developed
in [20] to construct a periodic Hamiltonian which is still Uq(sl(2|1))-invariant, by adding a
“HL1”-type term which is not completely local. A simpler solution is also presented in [21].

5 Two site quantum chain Hamiltonian

To obtain a model of interacting electrons, we will use, as in [4] the following interpretation
of the states of the representation in terms of fermionic states:

|1i = |↑↓i = c†

↓c†

↑ |∅i

|2i = |↓i = c†

↓ |∅i

|3i = |↑i = c†

↑ |∅i

|4i = |∅i .

(62)

We will also use

The expression of the spin chain Hamiltonian obtained in this case is given by

n↑ = c†
n↓ = c†
n = n↑ + n↓ = 2E11 + E22 + E33 .

↑c↑ = E11 + E33 ,

where µ is related to the parameter of the representation λ by λ = qµ. By construction, the
creation and annihilation operators on diﬀerent sites commute. A Jordan–Wigner transfor-
mation can restore the standard anticommutation property.

This exactly solvable Hamiltonian with two parameters λ = qµ and q was already consid-
ered in [9, 4]. In [4], it was obtained as the derivative of the spectral parameter ˇR-matrix of
the four dimensional representation of Uq(sl(sl2|1)). The eigenstates of the periodic model
are found in [22] using the algebraic Bethe ansatz.

6 Reﬂection equations and open chain Hamiltonian

6.1 Reﬂection equations

We can also get an exactly solvable and Uq(sl(2|1))-invariant open chain Hamiltonian by
solving the reﬂection equations [23, 24, 25, 19, 26]

R12(u − v)K−

1 (u)R21(u + v)K−

2 (v) = K−

2 (v)t2M1R12(−u − v − 2ρ)M −1

2 (v)t2 =
1 K+

1 (u)t1R21(−u + v) .

(71)

The simplest solution for these equations is [26]

K−(u) = Id

and

K+(u) = M .

This is always a solution when the spectral parameter R-matrix is obtained via self-Baxterisation
[17], i.e. when the ˇR-matrix belongs to the algebra generated by bi, since in this case ˇR-
matrices with diﬀerent spectral parameters commute:

(72)

(73)

ˇR(u), ˇR(v)

= 0

∀u, v ∈ C .

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

10

The matrix M may in this case be interpreted as a Markov trace, as in [27].

More generally, there are two diagonal one parameter solutions for K−(u) (up to an overall

K +(u) = K −(−u − ρ)tM .

Note that the number of one parameter diagonal solutions is the same as for the supersym-
metric t–J model [10] and is equal to the rank of the underlying algebra.

6.2 Open chain transfer matrix and exactly solvable Hamiltonian

Using the Reﬂection Equations (70), (71), and the Yang–Baxter algebra (45), one can prove
that the double-row transfer matrices t(u) [19]

t(u) = ζ(u)−Ltr K+(u)T (u)K−(u)T (−u)−1

= tr0K+
· K−

0 (u) ˇRL0(u) ˇRL−1,L(u) · · · ˇR23(u) ˇR12(u) ·

(77)

(78)

commute for diﬀerent values of u [24, 25, 26, 28].

We then compute

tr0K+

It is standard to use this expression, divided by tr0K+
0 (0), to get a spin chain Hamiltonian
with nearest neighbour interaction. By construction, this Hamiltonian commutes with t(u)
for all values of u and it is hence exactly solvable [24].

This operation however provides nothing here, since, for all the diagonal solutions for K+,
0 (0) = 0. This phenomenon was noticed in [28], and explained by the use of

we have tr0K+

11

typical representations, which implies trM = 0 (actually StrM = 0 if no bosonisation is
performed). A method was found there to prove that, in the case

K−(u) = 1

and

K+(u) = M ,

the quantum chain Hamiltonian

Hj,j+1

L−1

j=1
X

still commuted with t(u) for all values of u. The Uq(sl(2|1)) symmetry is built-in in this case,
since the expression of the Hamiltonian (81) contains only the coproduct of some Casimir
operators (See equations (61), (38), (39) and (34) which provide the expression of Hi,i+1 in
terms of some (ρ ⊗ ρ)∆(Cp)). This Hamiltonian is then both exactly solvable and quantum
group invariant.

Another way to obtain a Hamiltonian with local interaction in the cases when tr0K+
0 (0) is
to take the second derivative of t(u) at u = 0. This method was also used in [29], where the
vanishing of the factor was due to the fact that q was such that q4 = 1. It applies also with
the solutions for K+ diﬀerent from M and given by (76) and (74) or (75).

unchanged (up to constant terms).

7 Another spin chain Hamiltonian: using the fermionic

basis of Uq(sl(2|1))

Alternatively, we could have used form the beginning the fermionic basis to describe the
quantum algebra. In this basis, the Cartan matrix is

The generators K1, K2, E1, E2, F1, F2 in the fermionic basis are, in terms of the generators

As algebras, Uq(sl(2|1)) in both bases are identical. Only the choices of simple root are
diﬀerent. However, the Hopf structure are not identical: the coproduct in the fermionic basis
is given by

˜∆(Ki) = Ki ⊗ Ki ,
˜∆(Ei) = Ei ⊗ 1 + Ki ⊗ Ei ,
˜∆(Fi) = Fi ⊗ K −1
i + 1 ⊗ Fi ,

which, in terms of the distinguished generators, is diﬀerent from (10) (See [8]), and will produce
(using the same algorithm as for the distinguished case) a quantum chain Hamiltonian diﬀerent
from (67):

Hf erm = Hhop + Hf erm
diag

with

Hf erm

diag = n↑in↓i + n↑i+1n↓i+1 − [2µ + 1]

+ qµ+1[µ](n↑i + n↓i+1) + q−µ−1[µ](n↑i+1 + n↓i) .

(107)

The Hamiltonians obtained with the distinguished basis and with the fermionic basis are
actually very close to each other: the only diﬀerence is in boundary terms, which are symmetric
in ↑ and ↓ in the distinguished case, but not in the fermionic one. When summed over the
chain, the diﬀerence of the Hamiltonians Hf erm
open (without integrable boundary terms
added) is indeed

Although diﬀerent, the two Hopf structures deﬁned by (10) and (105) are equivalent [30]

through a Reshetikhin twist [31]

satisfying

˜∆(a) = F ∆(a)F −1 ,

(ǫ ⊗ 1)F = (1 ⊗ ǫ)F = 1 ,
(F ⊗ 1)(∆ ⊗ 1)F = (1 ⊗ F )(1 ⊗ ∆)F .

(105)

(106)

(109)

(110)

(111)
(112)

It was indeed proved in [30] that an operator F satisfying (110) could be obtained as the
factor of the universal R-matrix of Uq(sl(2|1)) related with the fermionic root which deﬁnes
the super-Weyl reﬂection that relates the two bases.

This implies that open quantum chains built with the two-site Hamiltonians (67) and (106)

are equivalent, the equivalence matrix being given by

F (L) being deﬁned recursively as

ρ ⊗ · · · ⊗ ρ

F (L) ,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

F (L) ≡ (F ⊗ 1⊗L−1

)(∆ ⊗ 1⊗L−1

)F (L−1) .

(113)

(114)

As in [8], this equivalence is simple for the two site Hamiltonians (i.e. for (67) and (106)
themselves). However, it becomes highly non trivial for longer chains, the reason being that
the equivalence produced by the twist is non local.

In [32], Reshetikhin twists are applied to the supersymmetric t–J model and to the super-
symmetric Hubbard model with pair hopping (67). This leads to multiparametric Hamiltoni-
ans. The eﬀects of these twists are visible in the bulk term of the Hamiltonian, in contrast
with the action of our twist which relates the distinguished construction to the fermionic one,
and which aﬀects only boundary terms.

Such Hamiltonians were found in [33, 16]. It was noticed that, although not Hermitian, they
led to Hermitian Hamiltonian when multiplied by (1−2n↓i−2n↑i+4n↑in↓i) (the parity operator
on one site), the result satisfying also a Temperley–Lieb algebra (with non vanishing square).
It could also be of interest to investigate the use of the Hamiltonian (116) itself for reaction-

diﬀusion processes [34].

Acknowledgments:
I warmfully thank P. Pearce and V. Rittenberg for interesting dis-
cussions, and for pointing out some references. I am also indebted to Prof. I. Musson who
convinced me about the existence of Scasimirs in the case of sl(m|n).

A Appendix: Scasimirs of U(sl(2|1))

We give in this appendix the expressions of the Scasimirs of non-deformed superalgebra
U(sl(2|1)).

The Scasimir of osp(2|1) appeared in [35, 36, 37]. In [37], the expression of the Scasimir

is also given in the q-deformed case.

The proof of existence of Scasimir operators for osp(1|2n) was given in [38, 39], where it
was also proved that the Scasimir was the square root of a Casimir element of degree 2n. An
explicit expression of the Scasimir is written in [39].

The existence of Scasimir operators in the case of sl(m|n) is known to Musson [40].
The classical superalgebra sl(2|1) is deﬁned by the relations

[h1, h2] = 0 ,
[hi, ej] = aijej ,
[e1, f1] = h1 ,
[e1, f2] = [e2, f1] = 0 ,
[e2, e2]+ = [f2, f2]+ = 0 ,
[e1, e3] = [f1, f3] = 0 ,

[hi, fj] = −aijfj ,

[e2, f2]+ = h2 ,

where

The last relations in (120) may also be written as Serre relations

e3 = [e1, e2]

and

for p ≥ 2. Their sum Cp and diﬀerence Sp are, respectively, Casimir operators and Scasimirs
of U(sl(2|1)), i.e.
they satisfy the classical analogues of (20,21). The relations (14,15,16,
22,23,24) are still valid as long as the indices pi are greater or equal to 2. Notice that the
classical operators Q(±)
, Cp and Sp are not the limits as q goes to 1 of the corresponding
quantum ones, but rather limits of some linear combinations of them.

As  a  simple  means  for  comparing  and  -  if  possible  -  predicting  scientific  impacts  of 
different  researchers  working  in  the  same  field,  we  suggest  comparing  their  "sales 
curves". A sales curve is the number of citations of the researcher’s papers per year, 
the  citation  rate,  considered  as  a  function  of  time.  As  examples,  we  present  the 
citation histories of 10 older well-cited scientists working in the same field. The sales 
curve  is  found  to  be  highly  individual,  that  is,  there  is  a  large  variation  between 
different  scientists’  sales  curves.  For  each  well-cited  scientist,  however,  the  sales 
curve  is  steadily  increasing  as  long  as  he  is  young  and  active,  and  its  slope,  the 
citation  acceleration,  contains  the  essential  information  about  his  impact.  The  slope 
averaged over the time of activity of the scientist is roughly independent of time and 
is a fairly age-independent measure of his scientific impact. In physics and chemistry, 
well-cited  active  scientists  have  time-averaged  citation  accelerations  at  the  order  of 
10  citations  per  year2  or  more.  The  normal  citation  acceleration  is  an  order  of 
magnitude smaller. We also show the sales curves for three large research institutes 
whose sizes have been fairly constant over the last 35 years. These sales curves are 
quite linear and have slopes at the order of 1 citation per scientist per year2.

Evaluation  of  research  is  necessary,  because  in  a  society  with  limited  human  and 
economic resources, priorities must be set and decisions taken. The task is difficult, 
however, because evaluations usually take place before consensus about the quality 
and  significance  of  the  research  has  been  reached  in  the  scientific  community. 
Therefore, the judgment of informed experts must be relied upon, and it is important 
that  they  have  access  to  statistical  material  prepared  in  a  useful  way.  The  present 
paper suggests a standard for this. 
 
The number of scientific articles published by a researcher is readily counted, but it 
tells  little  about  the  importance  of  the  work.  The  number  of  FLWDWLRQV,  F,  of  the 
published  articles  measures  the  LPSDFW  of  that  work,  although  not  necessarily  its 
TXDOLW\.  Nowadays,  citation  data  are  often  used for  research  evaluation,  but  reliable 
determination  and  competent  interpretation  of  such  data  require  experience  and 
awareness. 
 
Recently, Jorge Hirsch introduced a citation index measuring the cumulative impact 
of  a  scientist’s  work  [1].  This  so-called  K-index  has  become  very  popular,  partly 
because it is easily obtained provided one has access to the :HE(cid:3)RI(cid:3)6FLHQFH (WoS), 
the  search  platform  offered  by  7KRPVRQ(cid:3) 6FLHQWLILF  [2](cid:15)  the  former  ISI,  ,QVWLWXWH(cid:3) IRU(cid:3)
6FLHQWLILF(cid:3) ,QIRUPDWLRQ.  The WoS  includes  the  6FLHQFH(cid:3) &LWDWLRQ(cid:3) ,QGH[  (SCI)  and  has 
probably  become  the  most  versatile  and  user  friendly  citation  analysis  tool.  The  K-

 

2 

index  is  defined  as  the  number  of  articles  (published  in  SCI  source  journals)  that 
have had K citations or more. For example, a scientist with an K-index of 40 will have 
published  40  articles,  each  of  which  has  received  40  citations  or  more.  The  index 
can  be  determined  by  searching  a  given  author’s  name  under  the  WoS  *HQHUDO(cid:3)
6HDUFK  mode  and  sorting  the  selected  articles  by  7LPHV(cid:3) &LWHG  using  the  WoS  sort 
command. The result is unambiguous, provided that there are either no highly cited 
namesakes or they can be easily removed. 
 
The K-index reflects a scientist’s contribution based on a broad body of publications 
rather  than  based  on  a  few  high  impact  articles.  This  suppresses  the  impact  of  a 
single or a few highly cited papers, sometimes being methodological contributions or 
reviews.  The  K-index  favors  scientists  who  consistently  produce  influential  papers. 
The strong demand for quantitative and easy-to-check benchmarks supports the use 
of the K-index. 
 
The  number  of  citations  accumulated  until  at  present,  F(W),  and  the  current  value  of 
the  Hirsch-index,  K(W), both  increase  with  age  and are therefore  not  directly  suitable 
for ranking scientists of different age. Instead, a time derivative, F¶(W) or K¶(W), might be 
more useful. 
 
The  K-index  is  mathematically  a  more  complicated  quantity  than  the  number  of 
citations; in particular is the K-index for a group of scientists not equal to the sum of 
the  K-indices  for  the  individuals.  For  that  reason,  the  K-index  seems  unsuitable  for 
rating research groups. 
 
During the last decade, we have been developing search tools and have been trying 
out  strategies  for  research  evaluation.  A  task  often  met,  was  to  select  among 
candidates  of  age  35-50  for  directing  a  research  group  or  for  a  professorship. 
Another task was to rank research groups. The most useful strategy, to be described 
in the present paper, has been in extensive use by us and others for several years 
now, and it was made generally available in the WoS update end of November 2006. 
This strategy consists of obtaining and analyzing the time dependence of the rate of 
citations,  F¶(W).  These so-called  “sales  curves”  are  also  suggestive  for  predicting  the 
future impact of a scientist or a research group.

The  “Citation  Report”  included  in  the  most  recent  WoS  update  enables  any 
subscriber  to  obtain  sales  curves  for  any  named  scientist.  The  only  difference 
between the WoS sales curves and the ones obtained by us [3] and discussed below 
is that we used the number of citing papers rather than the number of citations [4]. 
 
The  time-dependent  impact  of  a  specific  author,  his  citation  rate,  F¶(W),  is  thus  the 
number of scientific articles which in a given year cites at least one of his papers. The 
citation rate considered as a function of time, W, may be seen as his sales curve. 
 
For a single paper, the citation rate starts up slowly and the first citations appear from 
between months and years after the publication of the paper itself. The length of this 
time lag depends on the research area, the type of research, and the contents of the 

 

3 

paper.  The  citation  rate  then  peaks,  typically  after  a  few  years,  and  finally  decays 
slowly. Most papers receive only a few citations, but those papers which are decisive 
for the sales curve usually keep being cited for a long time, often decades.

Publication Year of Citing Papers

(cid:3)

 
)LJXUH(cid:3) (cid:20)(cid:29)  Time-dependent  citation  rates,  or  sales  curves,  F¶(W)  vs.  W,  of  well-cited 
scientists  active  in  the  same  field.  The  citation  rate  is  expressed  as  the  number  of 
citing papers per year. The slope, F¶¶(W), of the citation rate is the citation acceleration 
and its time average is a fairly age-independent measure of the researchers impact. 
The sales curves of Violet, Brown, and Black are typical for the majority of recognized 
researchers in this field. 
 
Figure  1  shows  the  time-dependent  citation  rates  (sales  curves)  of  individual 
scientists working in the same field of research. In order to have good statistics and 
long histories, we have chosen well-cited scientists of age 45-65. Since the task we 
see as most important is to evaluate candidates of age 35-50 for leading positions or 
large research grants, our reason for choosing older scientists is that we want to use 
their  histories  as  a  guide  for  extrapolating  the  sales  curves  of  the  younger 
candidates.  These  scientists  are  in  some  sense  ideals,  also  because  their  sales 
curves have not yet started to decline, as is the case for many scientists above age 
50. 
 
The start up of a sales curve is determined by how long it takes for the first papers to 
get  cited  and  by  how  long  it  takes  for  the  scientist  to  find  “himself”.  But  after  he  is 
established, his sales curve seems to rise more or less OLQHDUO\ for a long time. The 

 

4 

linear  rise  of  the  citation  rate  during  this  period  is  presumably  caused  by  the  facts 
that, at the same time as the scientist’s previous papers are being cited, he produces 
new papers, which get cited at an increasing rate because he is becoming more and 
more known. Moreover, as the scientist gets established, he may produce papers at 
an increasing rate, often because he has more and more people to work with. 
 
As a fairly DJH(cid:16)LQGHSHQGHQW measure of a scientist’s impact, we shall therefore take 
the slope of the sales curve, that is, the time derivative of the citation rate, F¶(W), i.e. 
the FLWDWLRQ(cid:3)DFFHOHUDWLRQ, D(W) 

(cid:3)F¶¶(W), and average it over a suitable time interval:

This is the slope of the straight line connecting two points on the sales curve, i.e. of 
the chord. Here and in the following, F(W) is the total number of citations received until 
time  W.  If  the  scientist’s  impact  must  be  condensed  into  RQH(cid:15)  simple-to-evaluate 
number, we suggest the citation acceleration averaged over the entire career of the 
scientist,  i.e. from  the time  W0 of  his first  publication, at  which  point  F¶(W0)  =  F(W0)  =  0, 
and until now, W:

So  in  order  to  evaluate  the  average  citation  acceleration,  one  needs  to  know  the 
length  of  the  career,  W-W0,  and  the  latest  citation  rate  (for 
),  or  the  total  number  of 
citations (for <D>). The two measures,(cid:3)
 and <D>, are equal if F(W) = ½(W-W0)F¶(W), that 
is, if the area under the sales curve equals the area of the triangle with edge-lengths 
W-W0 and F¶(W); this is for instance the case when the sales curve is a straight line. The 
(cid:3)(cid:237)(cid:31)D> is a measure of the upwards curvature of the sales curve. If sales 
difference 
curves were straight lines, as is roughly the case (Figure 1), the number of citations 
would increase quadratically with the length of the career. 
 
In  order  to  provide  some  feeling  for  sales  curves  and  in  order  to  emphasize  that 
citation histories are individual, we now describe those shown in Figure 1. This we do 
in  order  of  decreasing  total  number  of  citations  which  is  roughly  the  order  of 
decreasing K-index and age (see Table I): 
 
5HG did not have a particularly strong impact during the first 15 years of her career. 
At the end of this period, she was receiving about 60 citing papers per year, that is, 
her  citation  acceleration,  averaged  over  the  first  15  years,  was  4  citing  papers  per 
year2. She then made a seminal contribution which strongly accelerated her citations, 
and this acceleration was kept up during the subsequent 20 years by citations to an 
increasing number of important papers produced by her and her increasing number 
of  excellent  collaborators.  Currently,  she  is  receiving  over  1200  citing  papers  per 
year.  This  means  that  over  the  last  twenty  years,  her  average  citation  acceleration 
was  60  citing  papers  per  year2,  an  order  of  magnitude  larger  than  before.  She  has 
opened a new, interdisciplinary direction of research and has become its established 
leader.  Her  Hirsch  index  is  71,  12  100  papers  have  cited  her  works,  and  averaged 
over her entire career, her citation-acceleration measures are respectively  =38 and 
<D>=21 citing papers per year2. The latter numbers are not only large but also show 
that her sales curve bends upwards.

7DEOH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:29) Scientist and time (W0) of first publication, length (W-W0) of scientific activity until 
2005, Hirsch-index (K), number of citing papers until December 2005 (F), ratio of the 
number of citations to that of citing papers, and the average citation accelerations ( (cid:3)
and <D>) defined in equation (1). 
 
%OXH is older and has a much smoother citation history; his citation rate is fairly linear. 
During  the  first  twenty-five  years  of  his  career,  the  citation  rate  increased  with  a 
slightly increasing acceleration, peaking at about 70 citing papers per year2, but then 
it decreased for a while, and recently picked up a bit again. He is currently receiving 
700  citing  papers  per  year,  his  Hirsch  index  is  60,  and  he  has  had  12  500  papers 
 =20 
citing his works, yielding career-averaged citation accelerations of respectively 
and <D>=18. 
 
*UHHQ  is  slightly  younger  than  Red  and  started  out  more  successfully  with  a  highly 
cited thesis work and subsequent well-cited papers. After about ten years, he made 
further  important  contributions,  this  time  in  a  somewhat  different  field.  This 
accelerated his citation rate to a level of almost 500 citing papers per year, where it 
has remained for a decade now. He is a theorist working with only a few people and 
can therefore hardly sustain a further increase of his citation rate, unless he moves 
into  an  exceptionally  fruitful  field.  Unlike  Red  and  Blue,  he  has  not  developed  a 
popular method, the users of which provide a significant “basis” for his citation rate. 
His Hirsch index is 56, and with 9700 citing papers he belongs to ISI’s 250 most cited 
physicists.  The  career-averaged  citation  accelerations  are  respectively  =16  and 
<D>=18, with the former being smaller than the latter. 
 
0DJHQWD is much younger. She is an experimentalist whose sales curve has taken off 
in the last ten years, during which she has been highly successful and have also built 
up research groups. The slope of her sales curve is currently D(W)=100 citing papers 
per year2. In 2005 she received almost 700 citations, her Hirsch index is 48, she has 
received a total of 4400 citing papers, and her career-averaged citation accelerations 
are respectively  =31 and <D>=22, with the former exceeding the latter.

6SUXFH is of the same age as Magenta. His thesis and subsequent work, carried out 
in  an  experimental  surrounding,  was  timely  and  had  a  large  impact.  But  being  a 
theorist working mostly alone on a most difficult, important problem, his citation rate 
has increased only slowly during the last 15 years. He has become an authority in his 
field and recently received a large, national prize. Currently he is receiving a little less 
than  300  citing  papers  a  year,  and  has  received  4400  citing  papers  in  total.  His 
Hirsch index 33, and his career-averaged citation accelerations are respectively  =14 
and <D>=22, with the latter exceeding the former. 
 
%OXLVK  is  of  the  same  age  as  Magenta  and  Spruce.  He  is  a  theorist  with  a  nearly 
linear sales curve:  =20 and <D>=16 citing papers per year2. He recently received a 
prestigious international prize for developing a new method. 
 
&\DQ is a year older and spent her first five active years in the former Soviet Union. 
That  delayed  the  citations  to  her  early  works.  During  the  last  15  years,  she  has 
worked  mostly  on  the  theory  of  novel  superconducting  and  magnetic  materials.  In 
2001  and  the  following  years,  she  played  a  key  role  in  clearing  up  the  mechanism 
behind  an  important,  unexpected  experimental  discovery.  This  made  her  citation 
acceleration  peak  at  75  citing  papers  per  year2.  Her  Hirsch  index  is  35,  she  has 
received a total of 3100 citing papers, and her career-averaged citation accelerations 
are respectively  =15 and <D>=14 citing papers per year2. 
 
%URZQ,  %ODFN,  and  9LROHW  have  sales  curves  typical  for  the  majority  of  recognized 
researchers in this field with career-averaged citation accelerations between 1 and 6 
citing  papers  per  year2.  Since  they  are  senior,  they  have  substantial  numbers  of 
citations and respectable Hirsch indices, of about 25. 
 
We have seen that citation histories are quite individual. Moreover, citation rates vary 
from field to field. Even within the field considered here, moving towards nano- and 
bio-sciences as done by Red and Magenta, does in general give more citations. 
 
For the purpose of ranking scientists of age 35-50, the slope of the sales curve, the 
citation acceleration, is an appropriate measure. That would make the order of Table 
1  not  from  top  to  bottom,  but  would  move  Magenta  followed  by  Bluish  and  Spruce, 
upwards. 
 
Now,  despite 
individual  differences,  researchers  with  average  accelerations 
exceeding  ~10  citing  papers  per  year2  or  ~15  citations  per  year2  (in  the  field 
considered) are excellent, and the first task of an evaluation is simply to identify such 
candidates.  The  second  task  may  be  to  seek  desired  individualities,  and  for  that 
purpose, our citation histories might provide insight: 
 
We shift all the sales curves in time such that all careers start at the same time, W0 (cid:19)(cid:15)(cid:3)
and show the result in Figure 2. It is now obvious that presented with our scientists 
after merely  10  years of  activity  and  using  the  sales-curves  tool, Spruce  is the  only 
definitely  outstanding  young  researcher,  and  supporting  him  would  of  course  be  an 
excellent  choice.  In  the  second  rank  come Green,  Magenta,  and  Bluish,  which  with 
the benefit of hindsight is also correct. In the third rank come Cyan, Blue, and Brown, 
in that order. The only great error is of course that Red would not be selected. 

 

7 

 
After  15-20  years,  a  large  gap  stars  to  develop  between  the  high-acceleration  and 
the intermediate-acceleration researchers, with the gap lying around 10 citing papers 
per  year2.  After  15  years,  Magenta  takes  the  lead  over  Spruce,  Cyan,  Green,  and 
Bluish. Looking at the acceleration, rather than the rate of the citations, Red can now 
also be identified as promising. Finally, after 20 years, Red comes out, together with 
Magenta. The reasons for this are - besides talent - structural and topical.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:29) The sales curves from Figure 1, but plotted vs. the career lengths (W-W0) with 
the times (W0) of the first publication given in Table I. 
 
This analysis in terms of sales curves may be extended to UHVHDUFK(cid:3)JURXSV. In Figure 
3  we  show  the  sales  curves  for  three  large,  well-recognized  institutes  working  in 
fields closely related to the one of the individual researchers considered above. The 
sizes  of  these  institutes  have  been  roughly  constant  over  the  last 25  years  and  the 
sales  curves  have  been  normalized  with  the  number  of  scientists  (~250  PhD 
students, Post docs, and staff members). These sales curves are seen to be far more 
linear than those of the individual researchers considered above. The differences in 
citation rates are mainly related to the different ages of the institutes, but, here again, 
the  VORSHV  are  significant  indicators  of  the  research  impact.  The  corresponding 
 = 1.1, 0.8, and 0.5 citing papers per scientist per year2. Considering 
numbers are: 
the  fact  that  each  publication  from  such  an  institute  has  on  the  average  3  authors 
from  that  institute,  this  means  that  the  average  acceleration  for  an  individual 

 

8 

researcher in this field is about 2 citing papers per year2 or 3 citations per year2. This 
fits well with the numbers given in Table 1 for Violet, Brown, and Black.

We have presented time-resolved citation analyses, in particular the so-called sales 
curves,  which  we  have  found  useful  for  evaluating  the  scientific  impact  of  a 
researcher or a research group, and for extrapolating into the future. The increase in 
the  rate  of  cumulated  citations,  the  citation  acceleration,  is  a  fairly  age-insensitive 
measure of the impact. This method is suitable in particular for comparing individual 
scientists or  research groups  of  widely  different ages, but  within  the  same  research 
discipline.

[3]  We  used  the  search  options  available  under  the  host  671(cid:3) ,QWHUQDWLRQDO  (URL: 
http://www.stn-international.de/), in particular the functions for carrying out statistical 
investigations. STN enables access to the SCI (file 6&,VHDUFK) under its own specific 
search system. A citation search can provide the number of FLWLQJ(cid:3)SDSHUV of a specific 
article, or of the ensemble of articles of a specific author. The publication years of the 
citing papers are easily selected and their number plotted as a function of time. Self-
citations may be included or easily excluded from the body of citing papers. 
 
[4] One citing paper may comprise more than one citation of a specific author, on the 
average between 1.3 and 2.0 depending on the author. In general, the more papers 
an author publishes on related topics, the more does his number of citations exceed 
his number of citing papers.

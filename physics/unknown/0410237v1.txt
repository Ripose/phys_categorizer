Abstract 

 

 

The  atmospheric  plasma  is  regarded  as  an  effective  method  for  surface  treatments  because  it  can 

reduce  the period of  process  and does  not need  expensive  vacuum  apparatus.  The  performance  of non-

transferred plasma torches is significantly depended on jet flow characteristics out of the nozzle. In order 

to produce the high performance of a torch, the maximum discharge velocity near an annular gap in the 

torch  should  be  maintained.  Also,  the  compulsory  swirl  is  being  produced  to  gain  the  shape  that  can 

concentrate  the  plasma  at  the  center  of  gas  flow.  Numerical  analysis  of  two  different  mathematical 

models  used  for  simulating  plasma  characteristics  inside  an  atmospheric  plasma  torch  is  carried  out.  A 

qualitative comparison is made in this study to test the accuracy of these two different model predictions 

of  an  atmospheric  plasma  torch.  Numerical  investigations  are  carried  out  to  examine  the  influence  of 

different model assumptions on the resulting plasma characteristics. Significant variations in the results in 

terms of the plasma velocity and temperature are observed. These variations will influence the subsequent 

particle dynamics in the thermal spraying process. The uniformity of plasma distribution is investigated. 

For  analyzing  the  swirl  effects  in  the  plenum  chamber  and  the  flow  distribution,  FVM  (finite  volume 

method) and a SIMPLE algorithm are used for solving the governing equations.   

Key Words: plasma torch, swirl effect, spraying, plasma distribution 

1. Introduction 

In  order  to  provide  high  quality  for  specialized  applications  and  to  aid  in  the  development  of  the 

technology, many studies of electric arcs have been made. Non-transferred arc plasma torches have been 

used  for  producing  thermal  plasma  jet  in  various  industrial  applications,  such  as  atmospheric  or  low-

pressure  plasma  spraying,  thermal  plasma  waste  treatment,  plasma-assisted  chemical  vapor  deposition, 

plasma preparation of ultra-fine powders, etc. Material processes by non-transferred torches are usually 

executed at the outside of the torch where the thermal plasma is exposed to an ambient gas environment

The majority of existing methods of using plasma torch generates the plasma only in a vacuum state. 

And  due  to  the  higher  expense  of  vacuum  apparatus  and  generator,  the  existing  method  is  lack  of 

economical  efficiency  and  productivity.  For  resolving  these  problems,  the  velocity  distribution  is 

numerically analyzed and the size of flame is also experimentally photographed. 

For  stabilizing  the  plasma  that  is  generated  in  using  atmospheric  plasma  torch,  flow  behavior  is  the 

most  important  factor  [2].  Also  by  concentrating  the  generated  plasma  in  the  center  of  jet  flow,  the 

uniformity for the surface treatment may be obtained. There are two kinds of methods to get these effects. 

Firstly, there is the wall-stabilization in which the plasma is concentrated to the center by decreasing the 

electrical  conductivity  through  the  cooling  of  the  outer  wall  while  surrounding  the  arc  occurred  space 

with cold metal wall. This is resulted in the stabilization of a flame and decrease the heat loss. Secondly, 

there is the vortex-stabilization in which the plasma is surrounded by swirl that is occurred by injecting 

the plasma gas. For the replacement of large-sized plasma torches, Kuo [3] studied in miniaturizing the 

existing plasma torches as shown in Fig. 1.   

There  are  many  researches  to  study  the  flow  characteristics  of  plasma  torch  using  some  numerical 

models.  In  the  present  work,  numerical  analysis  of  two  different  mathematical  models,  constant  heat 

source  model  (CHS)  [4-6]  and  magneto-hydrodynamics  model  (MHD)  [7],  used  for  simulating  the 

plasma characteristics of an atmospheric plasma torch is carried out to observe the discharge phenomenon 

by gas kinds that can influence the surface treatment of materials.

where  φ  is the general variable, 

φΓ   the corresponding diffusion coefficient, and  Sφ   the source term; 

u

  and 

υ  are the axial and radial velocity components,  ρ  is the mass density, and  x   and 

r

  are the 

distances in the axial and radial directions, respectively. The terms of the governing equations are listed in 

Table 1. It is to be noted that in the calculation of the total energy deposited within the torch volume in the 

CHS model, we take into account the full nozzle volume due to the fact that the arc length for the given 

operating conditions is almost the same as the length of the torch nozzle. A few studies employed constant 

heat source (CHS) model by assuming a volume averaged source term instead of the Joule heating model 

in  the  energy  equation.  The  major  difference  between  the  CHS  and  MHD  models  is  reflected  in  their 

source terms of the momentum and energy equations, respectively. It is also noted that in the case of the 

MHD model we have additional force terms, due to the Lorentz force in the momentum equations, which

are absent in the CHS model.   

In view of the computational problems a few authors dealt the plasma generation inside the torch by a 

simplified  approach  which  is  known  as  the  CHS  model.  In  the  CHS  model,  the  local  arc  phenomenon 

inside the spray torch is replaced by a volume averaged source term in the energy equation to represent 

for  the  heating  of  primary  gas  by  the  electric  arc.  The  energy  source  term  is  given  by

  is the arc voltage 

outP

(V), 

I

  is  the  arc  current  (A),  and 

λ  is  the  torch  efficiency  factors  respectively.  However,  the  CHS 

model does not consider the influence of the Lorentz force that drives the gas inside the torch, which is 

reported to be significant especially in high intensity arcs.

The  effects  of  turbulence  on  the  energy  and  momentum  transports  are  estimated  using  the  standard 

k ε−   turbulence model, which is suitable for turbulent kinetic energy

constants appearing in the turbulent model are 

1C ε =1.44 and 

2C ε =1.92 [8].

where

  is an effective temperature, called Sutherland constant, 

which is a characteristic of the gas. The viscosity parameters of the Sutherland-law for gases are listed in 

Table  2.  In  the  present  study,  incompressible  gases  with  temperature  dependent  thermodynamic  and 

transport  properties  are  assumed  to  be  in  locally  equilibrium.  Different  effects,  namely  ionization, 

radiation, electron condensation, etc on the plasma characteristics are not considered here. 

2.2 Model and numerical methods 

Calculation  model  is  used  in  size  of  practical  torch  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  calculation  domain  is 

composed  to  60mm×80mm.  In  order  to  elucidate  the  flow  characteristics  of  plasma  torch,  two-

dimensional grid system was made. The SIMPLE (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations) 

algorithm  and  hybrid  scheme  are  also  employed.  In  the  present  study,  a  solution  is  deemed  converged 

when the mass imbalance in the continuity equation is less than 10-5. In addition, no-slip condition is used 

on the wall boundary. This is presumed that there is no mass flux on walls. In order to reduce a number of 

cells, the wall function was used. Also, Neumann condition that has zero gradient for all flow variables 

along streamline was applied on the outlet boundary, since the flow variables were difficult to know on 

the  outlet  boundary.  For  the  numerical  calculation,  we  used  air,  argon,  nitrogen  and  helium  gases  as 

 

 

3

working  fluids  and  2  m/s  as  inlet  velocity.  Then  the  current  and  the  power  output  of  the  torch  are 

considered as 250A and 5kW, respectively.   

 

3. Results and Discussion 

The aim of the present study is to compare the numerical results of the discharge characteristics of the 

atmospheric plasma torch gained from MHD model with those of the CHS model.   

Figure 2 shows the contours of axial velocity of the torch with swirl and without swirl effects. It is seen 

that the maximum velocity with swirl showed about 2 times that with the case of no-swirl.   

Then the profiles of the centerline axial velocity in each gas species are shown in Fig. 3. Here x-axis 

represents  the  centerline  of  the  torch  and  the  origin  means  the  end  of  the  torch  and  the  start  of  the 

discharge.  The  profiles  of  the  axial  velocity  computed  using  the  CHS  and  MHD  models  show  large 

differences in their distribution. It is noted that the velocity distribution with the CHS model is aligned 

more uniformly than that of the MHD model. Then the CHS model shows lower velocity distribution than 

that of the MHD one, due to the absence of the Lorentz force assumptions in momentum equations. It is 

also seen that the maximum axial velocity of the MHD models is larger than that of the CHS model. This 

is due to the existence of high electrical field strength near the cathode in the MHD model, which is not 

taken into account in the CHS model.   

As shown in Fig. 3, the velocity profile of nitrogen in the MHD model is similar to that of air along the 

centerline.  And  the  velocity  profiles  of  nitrogen  and  air  in  the  MHD  model  from  the  origin  to  0.04  m 

along the x-axis are higher than those of the other gas species. But the velocity profile of argon from 0.04 

m  to  0.08  m  is  higher  than  that  of  the  other  gas  species.  Results  show  that  the  velocity  magnitude  of 

helium is the smallest of them. These results represent the effect of the different viscosity parameters of 

the Sutherland-law in each gas species.   

Figure 4 shows the influence of both the CHS and MHD models in each gas species on the distribution 

of the centerline axial discharge temperature from the exit of the torch. It is seen that the profiles of the 

discharge  temperature  computed  using  the  CHS  and  MHD  models  show  large  differences  in  their 

distribution. The variations of temperature in the CHS model are smaller and more stable than those of 

the MHD model. And their respective temperature distributions in the MHD model are found significantly 

different, especially with steeper variations than those of the CHS model near the exit of the torch. This is 

due to the existence of high electric field strength inside the torch before discharge in the MHD model, 

which cannot be captured by the CHS model.         

It is noted that the CHS model could be used to predict the plasma dynamics in each gas species and at 

high  intensity  arcs.  However,  it  is  suggested  that  the  CHS  model  may  be  used  only  when  the  Lorentz 

force  is  negligible,  which  is  true  in  the  case  of  low  intensity  arcs  ( <50  A)  [10].  As  we  observe 

I

significant variations both in the discharge velocity and temperature computed through different models, 

between the CHS and MHD models, the resulting particle dynamics is expected to affect significantly.

4. Conclusions 

The effect of the swirl flow is studied numerically in the atmospheric plasma torch. The comparison 

results between the MHD and CHS models are depicted. Due to lack of the experimental data inside the 

plasma  torch,  no  direct  comparisons  have  been  made.  But  the  discharge  behaviors  by  gas  species  are 

studied experimentally to operate the highest plasma flame. The major conclusions are as follows: 

1)  The method of vortex-stabilization is acquired by the occurred swirl flow. 

2)  The MHD model is more realistic in high intensity arcs than the CHS model.

Abstract 

First  observation  of  liquid  xenon  scintillation  due  to α-particles  and  γ-rays  with  a  large  area 

avalanche photodiode immersed in the liquid is reported. An energy resolution of 10% (FWHM) 

and  a  coincidence  time  resolution  of  less  then  1  ns  (FWHM)  were  measured  with  5.5  MeV 

α-particles and 511 keV γ-rays, respectively.  

The  quantum  efficiency  of  the  photodiode  for  xenon  scintillation  light  (λ=178 nm)  is 

estimated to be ~100%.

1.  Introduction 

Liquid xenon is a promising medium for detectors of ionising radiation. Large atomic number, 

relatively  high  density,  high  light  output  and  fast  decay  time  make  it  an  excellent  scintillator 

suitable for a number of applications such as particle physics, astrophysics and nuclear medicine. 

Its  scintillation  spectrum  lies  in  the  short  wavelength  region  centred  at λ=178 nm  [1].    Besides 

being sensitive to the VUV light, the photodetectors must perform under rather severe conditions, 

namely,  low  temperature  (about  -100ºC)  and  external  pressure  variations  typically  in  the  range 

from  10-7  mbar  to  5  bar.  In  addition,  they  have  to  be  compatible  with  high  purity  liquid  xenon 

environment. 

Several  groups  used  successfully  some  types  of  photomultiplier  tubes  in  liquid  xenon. 

Recently developed large area avalanche photodiodes (LAAPD) have higher quantum efficiency, 

are  compact  and  do  not  need  voltage  dividers.  Moreover,  low  inherent  radioactivity  and  small 

mass can be an additional benefit for some applications (search for Weakly Interactive Massive 

Particles is an example [2]).   

It was shown that good energy and time resolution can be obtained with a LAAPD coupled to 

crystal scintillators [3,4]. A LAAPD was also operated in a gas scintillation proportional counter 

filled with xenon gas [5]. In our previous work [6], we have demonstrated that LAAPDs can be 

operated  at  temperatures down to  -100 °C without degradation of their performance. Moreover, 

the  dark  current  decreases  with  decreasing  temperature  by  more  than  four  orders  of  magnitude 

with respect to room temperature.  

In  the  present  paper  we  report  on  the  first  observation  of  liquid  xenon  scintillation  due  to 

α-particles and γ-rays with a large area avalanche photodiode.

2. Experimental Set-up 

We  used  a  windowless  LAAPD  from  Advanced  Photonix,  Inc.  [7]  with  a  sensitive  area  of 

0.2 cm2.  These  LAAPDs,  manufactured  using  beveled-edge  technology,  are  sensitive  in  the 

wavelength  region  from  130  to  1100  nm.  They  have high quantum efficiency, low dark current 

and relatively small capacitance (~25 pF at a gain of 200 [8]).  

The  LAAPD  was  placed  in  a  small  stainless  steel  chamber  (Fig.1)  connected  to  the  gas 

purification system described elsewhere [9]. The chamber was heated to 70°C (maximum storage 

temperature  for  the  LAAPD  [8])  and  pumped  down  to  3×10-7 mbar.  Then,  purified  xenon  was 

circulated through the chamber during several hours to remove residual impurities. The chamber 

was cooled down to -100 °C, approximately, in a bath of alcohol mixed with liquid nitrogen and 

filled  with  liquid  xenon  until  the  photodiode  was  completely  immersed  in  the  liquid.  The 

temperature  during  the  measurements  was  stabilized  at  -102±1°C  being  monitored  by  two 

platinum thermoresistors glued to the middle and to the bottom of the chamber. The photodiode 

was operated at bias voltage between 400 and 1700 V corresponding, at –102°C, to the gain range 

from 1 to 1200. 

A.  Energy resolution measurements 

An  241Am α-source deposited on one side of a stainless steel disk was placed at a distance of 

15 mm from the photodiode (Fig.1). The active area of the source was covered with a mask made 

from stainless steel foil with a hole of 1.5 mm diameter to restrict the solid angle variation. The 

LAAPD was connected to a low noise charge sensitive preamplifier (Canberra 2001A). The fact 

that the dark current at -100 °C is less than 1 pA allowed to connect it as an ordinary solid state 

detector, i.e. with the bias voltage supplied through the highly resistive RC-filter incorporated in 

the preamplifier. The signal was amplified with a shaping amplifier (Canberra 2021) and fed into 

a multichannel analyzer. All measurements were made with the optimal shaping constant of 1 µs. 

 3 

 

Calibration of the whole spectrometric channel was made with a precision pulser connected to the 

test input of the preamplifier. 

B. Time resolution measurements 

Time  resolution  measurements  were  carried  out  with  a  22Na  source  placed  between  the 

experimental  chamber  and  a  barium  fluoride  crystal  coupled  to  a  Philips  XP2020Q 

photomultiplier. The bias voltage was applied to the LAAPD through an external filter, as shown 

in Fig.2. The output signal from the LAAPD was fed to a fast voltage preamplifier [10] with 50 Ω 

input impedance, 3.5 ns risetime and noise of 10 µV r.m.s. referred to the input  and split between 

a fast amplifier (Phillips Scientific 777) and a shaping amplifier (Canberra 2021, with τi=τd=1µs) 

for  measuring  the  amplitude.  The  reference  signal  was  generated  by  the  BaF2  crystal.  Constant 

fraction  discriminators  (Phillips  Scientific  715)  were  used  in  both  timing  channels.  The output 

signals  of  these  two  discriminators  were  used  as  START  and  STOP  for  a  time-to-amplitude 

converter  (TAC)  ORTEC  566.  The  amplitudes  of  the  signals  at  the  outputs  of  the  TAC  and 

shaping  amplifier  were  both  digitized  with  a  peak  ADC  (LeCroy  2259B),  which  was  triggered 

with a gate produced by a coincidence of the START and STOP signals within a time window of 

100  ns.  The  information  was  stored  in  a  computer  for  subsequent  off-line  analysis.  This  set-up 

allowed us to measure the amplitude dependence of the time resolution.  

3. Results and Discussion 

 

A.  Energy resolution and quantum efficiency 

The dependence of the gain on the bias voltage was measured by recording the amplitude of 

the  charge  signal  from  the  LAAPD  due  to  the  scintillation  produced  in  liquid  xenon  by  α-

particles as a function of the bias voltage (Fig. 3). The number of primary electron-hole pairs per 

α-particle, N0, was determined from measurements carried under applied voltages for which the 

 4 

 

amplitude  of  the  LAAPD  signal  was  constant  and  therefore  the  gain  could  be  assumed  unitary. 

The value of N0 was obtained comparing the amplitude of the signal due to α-particles under this 

condition with that of a calibration signal produced by injection of a known charge into the input 

of  the  preamplifier.  A  value  of  N0  equal  to  2400±100  was  found.  The  gain  was  obtained  by 

dividing the output charge of the LAAPD by eN0 (e is the elementary charge). 

Pulse height spectra of liquid xenon scintillation due to 5.5 MeV α-particles were acquired for 

different values of the LAAPD gain. A typical amplitude spectrum obtained with a gain of 120 is 

shown in Fig.4. In a different geometry (the source at a distance of about 5 mm from the LAAPD 

window),  the  60  keV  γ-rays  emitted  by  the  241Am  source  could  also  be  detected  as  shown  in 

Fig.5. The energy resolution is poor due to the large variation of solid angle.  

The  dependence  of  the  energy  resolution  obtained  with  α-particles  on  the  LAAPD  gain  is 

presented in Fig.6. 

The energy resolution of an APD-scintillator system can be written as [11]:

where Ne is the number of noise electrons referred to the preamplifier input, M is the APD mean

multiplication process. The excess noise factor can be estimated [12] with

where k is a weighted average ratio of the hole ionization rate to  that for electrons, which for a 

beveled-edge  LAAPD at normal conditions is approximately equal to 0.0017 [4]. In eq. (1), the 

first  term  is  the  electronic  noise  contribution,  the  second  term  takes  into  account  the  statistical 

 5 

 

fluctuations  of  the  gain  and  the  third  one  includes  all  the  fluctuations  associated  with  the 

scintillation, light collection and photon-to-electron conversion processes. 

The  value  of  Νe  was  determined  experimentally  with  a  test  pulse  fed  through  a  known 

capacitance to the input of the preamplifier. It varies with the gain due to the fact that the LAAPD 

capacitance depends on the bias voltage. For M>3, however, it is practically constant and equal to 

240 electrons, r.m.s. The shot noise due to dark current of the LAAPD is very small at -100 °C 

(few electrons), for an integration time constant of ~1µs [6]. 

As  one  can  see  in  Fig.6,  for  gains  lower  than  10  the  resolution  is  dominated  by  the 

preamplifier  noise.  For  gains  larger  than  200  the  resolution  becomes  worse  as  the  excess  noise 

factor increases with the increasing gain. For M between 10 and 200 the resolution is practically 

constant, being about 10%. 

Eq. (1) was fit to the experimental data with Ne, k and δ as free parameters. The best fit was 

obtained with Νe=255±16, k=0.0029±0.0003 and δ=0.0370±0.0006. The value for Νe is in good 

agreement with the measured one. The value found for k is significantly higher then that usually 

referred in the literature [4] (k=0.0017) for this type of devices at room temperature. As for the δ 

value,  according  to  our  estimate,  the  solid  angle  variation  contributes  to  δ with  approximately 

0.01.  The  photoelectron  statistics,  calculated  under  the  assumption  that  a  photon  produces  no 

more than one photoelectron, contributes an additional 0.02 

/1(

0N . The missing fluctuations 

)

of about 0.029 (in order to obtain 0.037) may arise due to the fact that it is energetically possible 

for a VUV photon with the energy of 7.1 eV to produce two or more electron-hole pairs. In this 

case, the above estimate of the fluctuations in the number of photoelectrons is not valid. Eventual 

non-uniformity of VUV light reflection from the α-source surface may also contribute. 

From the above results one can estimate the quantum efficiency of the LAAPD, Q, understood 

as  the  average  number  of  primary  electron-hole  pairs  produced  by  an  incident  photon.  If  we 

 6 

 

neglect reflections of VUV from the walls and the α-source surface, the number of electron-hole 

pairs due to an α-particle is given by

where  Eα  is  the  energy  of  the  α-particle,  Ws  the  average  energy  required  per  one  scintillation 

photon in liquid xenon and Ω the solid angle. 

Taking Ws=16.3eV [13], Eα=5.5×106 eV, 4π/Ω≈150 and N0=2400 one gets Q ≈ 100%.  

 

B.  Time resolution 

For γ-photon irradiation in the geometry of Fig.2, the solid angle and thereby the LAAPD signal 

amplitude  depend  considerably  on  the  position  where  the  scintillation  is  produced  in  liquid 

xenon.  Fig.  7  shows  the  time  interval  distributions  for  the  signals  above  the  threshold  of  1,500 

primary electron-hole pairs N0 (a), and for the signals in the range of N0 from 6,000 to 8,000 (b). 

For  further  analysis,  the  events  were  grouped  according to their amplitude and the width of the 

time interval distribution was found for each amplitude group. This procedure allowed measuring 

the time resolution as a function of N0 in the range from 1,000 to 10,000 primary electron-hole 

pairs.  Fig.  8  shows  the  results  obtained  for  gains  of  280,  605  and  1208.  In  all  cases,  the 

discriminator  threshold  referred  to  the  input  of  the  preamplifier  was  set  to  50  µV,  i.e.  five 

standard  deviations  above  the  preamplifier  noise.  For  lower  values  of  the  threshold,  the  rate  of 

random coincidences was too high. 

For  a  given  gain,  the  time  resolution  improves  with  the  increase  of  the  number  of  photons 

reaching  the  photodiode.  For  fixed  N0,  it  is  better  for  higher  gains.  The  best  resolution,  0.9 ns 

fwhm, was achieved with the gain of 605 at N0≈7800.

Acknowledgements 

The  data  obtained  for  gain  M=280  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  results  for  LSO  and  YAP 

scintillator  crystals  coupled  to  a  LAAPD  similar  to  the  one  we  used  [3]  (see  Table  1).  These 

crystals have decay time constants of 40 ns and 26.7 ns respectively, being close to that of liquid 

xenon (45 ns [14]). Hence, we can conclude that the LAAPD maintains its good timing properties 

The signals due to direct interaction of 511 keV γ-rays with the LAAPD were also observed. 

These events are, apparently, responsible for a peak in the coincidence time distribution preceding 

that due to xenon scintillation by about 4 ns (Fig. 9).  

A LAAPD was used for the detection of scintillation photons in liquid xenon. Immersed into the 

liquid, it has proven to be operational at T = -100 °C.  

An energy resolution of 10% (FWHM) was obtained with 5.5 MeV α-particles.  

The coincidence time resolution, measured with 511 keV γ-rays, is similar to that reported for 

LSO  and  YAP  scintillation  crystals.  The  best  value,  obtained  for  the  LAAPD  gain  of  605,  is 

The estimated quantum efficiency for liquid xenon scintillation photons is about 100 %

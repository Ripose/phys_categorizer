Abstract. Information theoretical tools are applied for the study of the sensitivity and
selectivity  enhancements  of  resistive  fluctuation-enhanced  sensors.  General
considerations are given for the upper limit of selectivity enhancement. The signal-to-
noise ratio and information channel capacity of fluctuation-enhanced chemical sensors is
compared to that of classical sensors providing a single output. The considerations are
done  at  the  generic  level  with  a  few  concrete  examples  and  include  the  estimation  of
scaling relations between the sensor size, the signal power, the noise power and the speed
of measurements versus the size, sampling rate and measurement time.

1. Introduction.

1.1 Classical gas sensing

Gas sensors for healthy environments

Concerns about outdoor air-pollution are widely spread. However, it is less known that

serious health-related problems may emerge from the indoor environment, too. Indoor air

contains a wide variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs, e.g. formaldehyde, vapors

of organic solvents), and a number of these VOCs have a higher concentration indoors

1

than outdoors [1]. Exposure to VOCs has been suggested to cause e.g., mucous irritation,

neurotoxic effects (fatigue, lethargy, headache etc.) and nonspecific reactions (e.g. chest

sounds and asthma-like symptoms) [2, 3]. It is clear that precise air quality monitoring is

of great importance in both in- and outdoor environments. This requires sensors capable

of detecting low concentrations of CO2,  CO,  SO2,  NOx,  O3,  H2S,  HF,  Cl2,  VOCs, etc.

sensitively  and  selectively.  (The  listed  gases  have  been  selected,  as  they  have  toxic

effects [4].) This huge need could be best fulfilled with simple, cheap and replaceable

sensors, most preferably electronic, semiconductor type, that can be easily integrated into

the existing monitoring and ventilation systems.

Semiconductor gas sensors

The operation principle of the “classical”, Taguchi-type of semiconductor gas sensors is

based on the change of the sensor resistance as the gas to be sensed is adsorbed on the

sensor surface [5]. This type of sensors represents a low-cost option to the standardized

and  bulky  methods  (e.g.,  gas  chromatography  or  mass  spectroscopy).  Mostly  metal-

oxides, e.g. SnO2, TiO2, ZnO, Mn2O3 and WO3, are used as sensor materials [6]. There is

a continuous work for improving the sensor performance including sensitivity and most

importantly, the chemical selectivity of these kinds of sensors.

Toward  sensitivity,  nanotechnology,  more  closely  the  use  of  Nanostructured

Materials (NsM), offers new possibilities in this area, too. In general, the characteristic

structural  length  of  a  NsM  is  typically  1  to  100  nanometers.  One  class  of  NsMs  is

composed  of  nanoparticles  or  nanocrystals,  and  in  a  porous  structure  these  materials

exhibit high surface area, which can be orders of magnitude higher than that of coarser,

micro-grained materials, therefore increasing sensitivity of the gas sensors [7, 8]. Likely,

not only the high surface area, but the actual nanostructure (e.g., neck and grain boundary

formation  between  nano-grains)  also  plays  role  of  sensitivity  improving  of  NsMs  [9].

Sensitivity can also be improved by doping the oxide materials [6, 10].

Chemical selectivity of semiconductor gas sensors can be improved by operating an

array of sensors, each of them having different sensitivity for different gases (can also be

called  electronic  nose)  [11].  This  can  be  achieved  by  e.g.,  using  different  (or  doped)

sensor  materials  or  by  operating  the  sensors  at  different  temperatures.  The  output  of

2

sensor  arrays  is  then  analyzed  by  pattern  recognition  methods  [12].  Analyzing  the

dynamic response of temperature-modulated sensors is also a possible way for improving

chemical selectivity [13]. However, lack of selectivity is still a significant problem for the

widespread use of semiconductor gas sensors.

1.2 Fluctuation-enhanced sensing

While  some  optical  chemical  sensors  analyze  the  absorption  or  emission  spectrum  of
gases and therefore able to generate a pattern, most of chemical sensors produce a single
number  output  only.  For  example  the  steady-state  value  of  a  Taguchi  sensor  or  the
steady-state  current  value  of  a  MOS  sensor  are  such  signals. To  generate  a  separate
pattern corresponding to different chemical compositions, a number (6-40) of different
types  of  sensors  are  needed  which  makes  the  system  expensive  and  unreliable  for
practical applications. On the other hand Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing (FES) is able to
generate a complex pattern by the application of a single sensor [14-22]. FES means that,
instead of using the mean value (time average) of the sensor signal, the small stochastic
fluctuations around the mean value are amplified and statistically analyzed. Due to the
grainy  structure  of  resistive  film  sensors,  these  materials  exhibit  significantly  (several
orders  of  magnitude)  increased  electronic  resistance  fluctuations  compared  to  single
crystalline materials and these fluctuations are strongly influenced by the random walk
(diffusion) dynamics of agents in the vicinity of intergrain junctions and by adsorption-
desorption noise. Stochastic analytical tools are used to generate a one-dimensional of
two-dimensional pattern from the time fluctuations. The analysis of these patterns can be
done in the classical way by using pattern recognition tools.

The history of FES is more than a decade long [14-37]. The name "Fluctuation-Enhanced
Sensing"  was  created  by  John  Audia  (SPAWAR,  US  Navy)  in  2001.  Here  we  mostly
focus on journal papers and neglect the vast body of conference contributions except in
cases where patents or conference papers have given the priority.

Using  the  electrical  noise  (spontaneous  fluctuations)  to  identify  chemicals  was  first
proposed by Bruno Neri and coworkers [14,15] in 1994-95 by showing the sensitivity of
conductance noise spectra of conducting polymers against the ambient gas composition.
In  1997,  Gottwald  and  coworkers  [16]  published  similar  effects  with  the  conductance
noise  spectrum  of  semiconductor  resistors  with  non-passivated  surface.  The  first
mathematical  analysis  of  generic  FES  systems  with  the  sensor  number  requirement
versus  the  number  of  agents  was  done  by  Kish  and  coworkers  in  1998  [17-19].  The
possibility of "freezing the smell" in the Taguchi sensor was first demonstrated by Vajtai
and later a more extensive analysis published by Solis et al [20]. In 2001, Smulko et al
have first time used Higher-Order Statistics (HOS) to enhance the extracted information
from  the  stochastic  signal  component  [21,26,29].  Hoel  et  al  showed  FES  via  invasion
noise  effects  in  room-temperature  nanoparticle  films  [22].  Schmera  and  coworkers
analyzed the situation of Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors and predicted the FES

3

spectrum for SAW and MOS sensors with surface diffusion [23-24]. Commercial-On-
The-Shelf (COTS) sensors with environmental pollutants and gas combinations were also
studied [25,29,30]. In nanoparticle sensors with temperature gradient, the possibility of
using the noise of the thermoelectric voltage for FES was demonstrated [28]. Ederth et al
analyzed and compared the sensitivity enhancement in the FES mode compared to the
classical  mode  in  nanoparticle  sensors  and  found  an  enhancement  of  a  factor  of  300.
Gomri et al [32,33] published FES theories for the cases of adsorption-desorption noise
and chemisorption-induced noise. Huang et al explored the possibility of using FES in
electronic tongues [34].

2. Sensitivity and selectivity enhancement in fluctuation-enhanced sensing

The statistics of the microscopic fluctuations in a system are rich and sensitive sources of
information  about  the  system  itself.  They  are  extremely  sensitive  because  the
perturbations of microscopic fluctuations require only a very small energy. On the other
hand, the related statistical distribution functions are data arrays thus they can contain
orders  of  magnitude  more  information  then  a  single  number  represented  by  the  mean
value of sensor signal used in classical sensing.

The  underlying  physical  mechanism  behind  the  enhanced  sensitivity are the temporal
fluctuations  of  the  agent's  or  its  fragment's  concentration  at  the  various  points  of  the
sensor volume where the sensitivity of the resistivity against the agent is different. This
effect will generate stochastic fluctuations of the resistance and the sensor voltage during
biasing the sensor with a current. The voltage fluctuations can be extracted (by removing
the  mean  value  by  AC  coupling)  and  strongly  amplified.  The  significantly  increased
sensitivity was demonstrated in several experiments, see and sensitivity enhancement by
several  orders  of  magnitude  has  been  demonstrated  by  Kish  and  coworkers  [29]  in
Taguchi sensors and Ederth and coworkers [31] in nanoparticle films.

Significantly increased selectivity can be expected depending on the type of sensor and
library  of  agents.  We  define  the  selectivity  enhancement  by  the  factor  of  how  many
classical sensors a fluctuation-enhanced sensor can replace. When using power density
spectra, the theoretical upper limit of selectivity enhancement is equal to the number of
spectral lines. At typical experiments that is about 10000. However, when the elementary
fluctuations are random-telegraph signals (RTS) the underlying elementary spectra are
Lorentzians  [35,36]and  the  situation  is  less  favorable  because  their  spectra  strongly
overlap. As a consequence, experiments with COTS sensors indicate that the response of
spectral lines against agent variations is often not independent. In simple experimental
demonstration with COTS sensors a selectivity enhancement of 6 was easily reachable
[18]. However, nano sensor development may be able to use all the spectral lines more
independently.  Because  both  the  FES  signal  in  macroscopic  sensors  and  the  natural
conductance fluctuations of the resistive sensors usually show 1/f like spectra [35,36], the
lower  the  inherent  1/f  noise  strength  in  the  sensor  the  cleaner  the  sensory  signal.  An
interesting analysis can me made, if we suppose we shrink the sensor size so much that
the  different  agents  probe  different  RTS  signals.  Then  1/f  noise  generation  principles

4

[37,38] indicate that one can resolve at most a few Lorentzian components in a frequency
decade  and  supposing  6  decades  of  frequency,  the  maximal  selectivity  enhancement
would be around 18, supposing 3 fluctuators/decade.

With  bispectra  [21,26,27],  the  potential  of  selectivity-increase  is  even  greater  because
bispectra are two-dimensional data arrays. In the case of 10000 spectral lines mentioned
above, the theoretical upper limit of selectivity increase is 100 million, however, in the
Lorentzian fluctuator limit, that number is also radically reduced. Because bispectra sense
only the non-Gaussian part of the sensor signal, for the utilization of the full advantages
of bispectra, it seems it is necessary to build the sensor for the submicron characteristic
size  range  to  utilize  elementary  microscopic  switching  events  as  non-Gaussian
components. Using the above mentioned estimation with 3 Lorentzian fluctuators/decade,
over 6 decades of frequency the selectivity enhancement would be around 300.

3. Signal to noise ratio and information channel capacity with classical sensors

Claude  Shannon  was  following  Nyquist's  [39]  and  Leo  Szilard's  [40]  pioneering
breakthroughs  of  using  the  entropy  and  the  bit  as  the  measure  of  information  and  for
white  noise  and  signal  spectra  he  found  [41]  that  the  information  channel  capacity  ,
which is the upper limit of possible information flow rate given in bit/s is:

where,  in  the  memory-less  limit,  W   is  the  bandwidth,  PS  is  the  mean-square  signal
voltage (signal "power") and  PN  is the mean-square noise voltage (noise "power"). This
equation can be rewritten for measurement time duration  tm by using Shannon's sampling
theorem:

If  the  sensor  resistance  is  measured  by  a  constant  current  generator  driving  then,  in
accordance with Ohm's law, the signal "power" is:

The noise in a resistive sensor with macroscopically homogeneous current density (when
contact noise is neglected) is the superposition of thermal noise and 1/f-like noises [14-
21]:

Su,N ( f ) = 4kTR + AR2I 2V (cid:1)1 f (cid:1)(cid:2)

where  Su, N ( f )  is  the  noise  voltage  on  the  sensor,  A  is  the  1/f  noise  coefficient  of  the
material (normalized 1/f noise spectrum in unit volume) [35, 36] and (cid:1) is the frequency
exponent (~ 0.8 - 1.3).

The noise "power" can be determined by the well-known relation:

= 0    and  f 2 (cid:1) 1/tm    approach holds.
where, in the thermal noise dominated limit the  f1
When the 1/f noise is the dominant already around frequencies  f 2 (cid:1) 1/tm  , then we are in
the constant noise "power" limit due to the constant variance of time-averaged 1/f noise:

This limit is the practical one because of the strong 1/f noise and the relatively long time
(ranging  from  millisecond  to  several  minutes)  resistive  sensors  need  to  produce  a
stationary resistance in a changed ambient gas.

In conclusion, classical resistive sensors have the following upper limit of information
flow rate:

.

According to Eq. (7), in the practical (1/f noise dominated) limit, the larger the volume of
the classical resistive sensor the grater the information channel capacity. However, in the
sufficiently  large  agent  concentration  limit,  the  saturation  time  is  controlled  by  the
underlying diffusion processes through the thickness  d of the film, therefore the shortest
measurement time in the is also controlled by diffusion:

(cid:5) (cid:7) 

  ,

where  D is the diffusion coefficient of the agent and/or its fragments through the film.
Therefore, the thinner the film the faster the response and greater the information channel
capacity. This fact indicates that in classical films the large volume should be reached by
small thickness and large surface.

In the case of FES, the signal is the change of statistical parameters of the measured FES
voltage  while  the  sensor  is  exposed  to  the  agent  compared  to  the  situation  while  the
sensor is exposed to the reference gas, such as synthetic air.

4.1 Power density spectrum based sensing

According the Shannon [41], when the signal and/or the noise have colored spectrum,
then the following relation is in effect:

C   =  

(cid:2) 
ln 1+ SS ( f )
(cid:3) (cid:6) 
SN ( f )

(cid:4) 
(cid:5) (cid:7) 
df   ,

B

(cid:1)

0

where  SS ( f )  and  SN ( f ) are the signal and the noise spectrum, respectively. Because the
FES power density spectrum is colored in both cases (while the sensor is exposed to the
agent and while it is exposed to the reference gas) it may look tempting to use Eq. (9)
with  the  agent  generated  spectrum  as  "signal  spectrum"  and  reference  gas  generated
spectrum  as  "noise  spectrum".  However  such  a  use  would  be  incorrect  for  several
reasons.  For  example,  according  to  Solis,  et  al  [30]  the  spectra  generated  by  different
agents  are  not  additive  in  commercial  Taguchi  sensors  which  is  probably  due  to  the
nonlinear  mixing  of  the  noise  dynamics  at  the  elementary  fluctuator  level  during  the
exposure to the diffusion processes of different fragments in the vicinity of the intergrain
junctions. Another reason is that in reality, the FES signal is the  change  of  the  power
spectrum of the measured FES voltage while the sensor is exposed to the agent compared
to the situation while the sensor is exposed to the reference gas, such as synthetic air. The
spectrum in the reference gas is not background noise but it is also a signal itself. The
background noise is related to the statistical inaccuracy of the measured spectra due to
finite-size/finite-time statistics. If we suppose that the statistical inaccuracies with the test
gas and the reference gas are independent and they have then:

C   =

where  M   is  the  number  of  separate  frequency  bands  (supposed  to  have  uniform
bandwidth  (cid:1)f ) having independent spectra. The rms error of the average spectrum in one
frequency band can be estimated as:

  , 

where  K   is  the  number  of  data  sequences  used  for  the  determination  of  the  average
spectrum,  tw  is the duration (time window) of a single data sequence,  N  is the number of
data in a single data sequence and  f s is the sampling frequency.

supposing equal frequency bands and supposing that the relative error of the spectrum is
much less than 1, thus the logarithmic term can be approached with a constant:

4.2 Amplitude-distribution-based sensing

A similar equation can be deduced for the amplitude distribution method:

(cid:10) (cid:7) 

where  M   is  the  number  of  separate  amplitude  bands  (supposed  to  have  uniform
bandwidth  (cid:1)U ) having independent statistics. In the present paper, we are focusing on
the  spectral  methods  however  we  note  that  the  deduction  of  relations  similar  to  the
spectral ones is straightforward. It is important to note, that, similarly to bispectra, the
only  meaningful  case  of  FES  is  the  situation  where  the  amplitude  distribution  is  non-
Gaussian.

4.3 Bispectrum-based sensing

The same principles, as applied above for power spectra, for the case of bispectrum  B
lead to the following information channel capacity:

C   =

Where  the  variance  (cid:1)B  of  bispectrum  estimation  represents  the  background  noise
amplitude.

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

In the paper of Nikias and Mendel [42], the variance  (cid:1)B2( f1, f 2) of bispectrum estimation
is given for rectangular time window as:

(cid:1)B2( f1, f 2) = N
K

S( f1)S( f 2)S( f1

+ f 2) ,         

(17)

where  f  is the frequency,  N  is the number of data points in a single data sequence.  K  is
the number of data sequences, and  S( f )  is the power density spectrum of the analyzed
signal. Supposing a single signal (no ensemble averaging), the total number of data point
is  L = KN   and  the  total  length  of  measurement  is  tm
= L f s   .  The  accessible  band  of
= f s /2   ,  where  flow  and  fhigh are the low-frequency
= f s /N < f < f high
frequency is  f low
and  the  high-frequency  limits,  respectively.  Thus,  Eq  (17)  can  be  written  in  a  more
practical form:

(cid:1)B2( f1, f 2) = (cid:1)B2( f1, f 2) = f stm

K 2 S( f1)S( f 2)S( f1

+ f 2) = N 2
f stm

S( f1)S( f 2)S( f1

+ f 2)

   (18)

4. Conclusion

A Taguchi sensors (resistive grainy film sensors) should be thin for fast response (short
tm) and therefore for large information channel capacity. Moreover, for classical sensing,
the  greater  the  size  and  smaller  their  1/f  noise  factor  (in  the  presence  of  agents!) the
greater their sensory information channel capacity. In the case of FES, the smaller the
size is the more sensory information up to the point that the signal becomes strongly non-
Gaussian,  so  amplitude  distribution  function  a  bispectra  can  also  be  utilized.  The
information  channel  capacity  will  also  be  influenced  by  the  choice  of  the  single
measurement time window  tw . The optimal choice depends also on the characteristics of
pattern recognition technique applied to identify the agent composition.

Abstract 

 

We consider a nonlinear optical system in general, and a broad aperture laser in particular in 

a  resonator  where  the  diffraction  coefficients  are  of  opposite  signs  along  two  transverse 

directions.  The  system  is  described  by  the  hyperbolic  Maxwell- Bloch  equations,  where  the 

spatial coupling is provided by the D’Alambert operator rather than by the Laplace operator. We 

show that this system supports hyperbolic transverse patterns residing on hyperbolas in far field 

domain, and consisting of stretched vortices in near field domain. These structures are described 

analytically by normal form analysis, and investigated numerically.

Spontaneous  pattern  formation  is  a  universal  behavior  observed  in  a  diverse  class  of  far  from 

equilibrium  systems  in  chemistry,  biology,  fluid  mechanics,  and  nonlinear  optics  [1,2].  Such 

patterns are characterized by an intrinsic scale determined by the dynamical parameters and not 

by the geometrical constraints imposed by the boundaries. The formation of spatial structures is 

attributed  to  the  balance  between  nonlinearities  (chemical  reaction  or  light- matter  interaction) 

and  transport  process  (diffusion  and/or  diffraction).  Spatial  structures  in  nonlinear  optics  have 

been discussed in a number of reviews [3-5].  All  known  pattern  forming  systems  are  governed 

by  partial  differential  equations  of  elliptic  type,  i.e.,  the  spatial  differential  operators  are  of  the 

Laplace type

.  In  optical  systems,  the  light  propagation  can  be  affected  by  both 

diffusion and/or diffraction,  i.e., the coefficient at differential operator is real  and/or imaginary, 

respectively.  The  diffusion  is  always  governed  by  an  elliptical  type  of  operator,  whereas  the 

diffraction process can either be modeled by an elliptic or a hyperbolic type of operator. In the

.  Physically,  this  means  that  diffraction  coefficients  in  the  resonator 

have  opposite  signs  for  different  transverse  directions.  This  can  occur  e.g.,  in  the  photonic 

crystal- like  resonators,  the  resonator  with  periodic  modulation  of  refractive  index  along  one 

transverse  (say  y)  direction.  The  periodic  spatial  modulation  of  refraction  index  allows  to 

modify, to reduce, or even to invert the sign of the diffraction coefficient. This phenomenon has 

been recently studied in conjunction with so called band-gap solitons in nonlinear optics [6], in 

atomic  Bose-Einstein  condensates  [7],  and  in  dissipative  nonlinear  photonic  crystal  resonators 

[8].  More recently, an experimental evidence of the inversion of diffraction coefficient sign in 

one-dimensional optical system has been reported in [9]. We note the recent work [10] where the 

periodic modulation of potential in one spatial direction resulted in a reversal of the sign of  the 

diffraction  coefficient  (effective  mass)  in  that  direction,  whereas  the  diffraction  coefficients  in 

other directions remained unchanged.   

Another example of hyperbolic systems is the near self- imaging resonators that also allow 

manipulating  the  value  and  the  sign  of  the  diffraction  coefficient.  In  particular,  the  diffraction 

coefficient  can  be  tuned  exactly  to  zero  at  precisely  self- imaging  configuration  [11].  Such

resonators  are  convenient  for  experimental  observations  of  nonlinear  optical  patterns  [12]. For 

cylindrical  (astigmatic)  resonators  the  net  diffraction  coefficient  can  be  manipulated  separately 

for  different  transverse  directions.  Consequently  the  differential  operator 

ˆL ,  which  is  an 

1,1

elliptical  Laplace  operator  for  spherically  symmetric  resonators,  can  be  converted  into 

hyperbolical D'Alambert operator 

 for cylindrical resonators.

Despite  of  the  importance  of  the  hyperbolic  patterns  that  result  from  the  competition 

between hyperbolic diffraction and nonlinearity, they have neither been experimentally observed 

nor  theoretically  investigated.  The  purpose  of  this  Letter  is  to  fill  this  gap  by  investigating  the 

theoretical side of this problem. We illustrate the importance of this competition by studying the 

formation of transverse structures in the full Maxwell-Bloch equations (MBE) under the effect of 

hyperbolic  diffraction.  In  particular,  our  study  reveals  that  the  hyperbolic  MBE  support 

transverse  patterns  residing  on  hyperbolas  in  far  field  domain,  and  respectively  consisting  of 

stretched  vortices  in  near  field  domain.  These  predictions  are  confirmed  by  an  analytical 

description based on the normal form reduction. The normal form approach makes our analysis 

more general: one can expect that hyperbolic patterns constitute a dominant dynamical behavior 

in a general class of nonlinear optical systems, and not only in a broad  aperture laser systems.   

We consider the single longitudinal mode large aperture lasers. In the good cavity limit, the 

spatiotemporal evolution of the slowly varying envelopes of the electric field E, polarization P, 

and population inversion D, can be described by the hyperbolic MBE:

modulation of the refractive index in the y direction or cylindrical astigmatism of the resonator. 

In  the  first  of  two  situations  mentioned  above,  when  the  origin  of  the  hyperbolic  type  of 

diffraction is due to periodic modulation of the refraction index in one direction, the derivation is 

performed  along  the  lines  described  in  [10].  Starting  from  the  usual  MBE  [13]  plus  a  periodic 

modulation of refractive index in  one  (y) transverse direction, one expands the electromagnetic 

field  into  a  set  of  spatial  modes  (i.e.,  spatial  harmonics)  and  keeps  only  the  two  most  relevant 

ones.  One  then  computes  the  corresponding  eigenvalues  and  eigenfunctions  (Bloch  modes). 

Finally,  rewriting  the  full  nonlinear  system  in  the  basis  of  these  Bloch  modes,  a  differential 

operator  of  the  D’Alambert  type  naturally  appears  for  the  envelope  of  the  Bloch  mode  at  the 

band-edge. In this derivation, one assumes that the amplitude of the harmonic modulation of the 

refraction  index  is  small,  which  justifies  the  truncation  of  the  expansion  to  only  two  spatial 

harmonics.  

elsewhere. 

In  the  second  situation,  when  the  origin  of  the  hyperbolic  type  of  diffraction  is  due  to 

cylindrical astigmatism of the near self- imaging resonator, the derivation is based on the ABCD 

matrix  of  the  (astigmatic)  resonator,  and  leads  directly  to  the  D’Alambert  type  of  differential 

operator  in  (1.a).  Semiclassical  calculation  of  the  coupling  between  the  electric  field  with  the 

matter,  as  performed  in  a  standard  way  (see  e.g.  [13])  results  in  the  hyperbolic  MBE  (1).  A 

detailed  derivation  of  the  hyperbolic  Maxwell- Bloch  equation  in  both  cases  will  be  reported 

The homogeneous steady states solutions of (1) are identical to those of the usual MBE. An 

essential  difference  appears,  however,  when  considering  pattern  formation  is  that  the  spatial 

coupling between different points in the transverse plane is provided by the D’Alambert operator 

rather  than  by  the  Laplace  operator.  This  spatial  coupling  will  modify,  as  we  shall  see,  the 

process of pattern selection that takes place in a resonator. In order to study transverse patterns in 

hyperbolic  system,  we  performed  a  derivation  of  the  order  parameter  equation,  namely  the 

hyperbolic  complex  Swift-Hohenberg  equation  (CSHE),  and  the  modified  complex  Newell-

Whitehead-Segel  Equation  (NWSE).  These  model  equations  are  paradigmatic  ones  for  the 

description of pattern formation process. The validity domain of the hyperbolic CSHE is limited 

by  the  following  assumptions: i)  “near threshold” condition:

The  linear  stability  analysis  of  the  trivial  zero  solution  of  (2)  (and  obviously  of  the  full 

MBE) gives some insight into the initial (linear) stage of the pattern formation in the system. The

.  These  unstable  modes  trigger  the 

spontaneous  evolution  of  the  field,  polarization  and  population  difference  towards  spatial 

patterns  which  occupy  the  whole  space  available  in  the  transverse  plane  of  the  cavity.    This 

simple relation illustrates a remarkable property of the linearly unstable area, which contrary to 

the usual elliptic CSHE where unstable modes form a ring in the Fourier space, is here bounded 

by hyperbolas. This behavior is displayed in the Fig.1. The hyperbolic shape of the instable area 

has others important  implications in the  pattern  forming  process:  i)  in  contrast  with  the  elliptic 

case  with  no  preferred  direction  because  of  the  isotropy  in  the  ( , )

x y   space,  the  rotational 

symmetry  is  broken  in  the  systems  with  hyperbolic  diffraction,  and  therefore  the  emerging 

pattern depends strongly on the direction of underlying tilted wave

number  is  illustrated  in  the  Fig.1  where,  for  instance,  the  possibility  of  patterns  with  two 

different wave-numbers

,  in  the  sense  that  the  y 

components of both vectors are of opposite signs, and  (cid:209)

 is the gradient operator acting in (x,y)

Equation  (4)  is  similar  to  the  Newell-Whitehead-Segel  Equation  (NWSE),  universally 

describing  slow  spatial  modulation  of  the  stripe  patterns  in  usual  (elliptical)  pattern  forming 

systems [17]. The relevance of the complex NWSE in nonlinear optics has been established [18]. 

However, Eq. (4) differs from the usual real or complex NWSE derived for elliptical systems in 

several  aspects:  i)  the  obvious  difference  with  elliptical  NWSE  is  the  differential  operator  of 

hyperbolic  type 

ˆ
L

¶=-

;  ii)  another  peculiarity  is  that  the  advection  in  the 

system described by Eq. (4) occurs along the direction 

=k

(

k -

x

)

 (see the second r.h.s. term 

of  Eq.  (4)),  and  not  along  the  direction  of  the  underlying  tilted  wave 

x kk=k
(
,

y

)

  as  could  be 

intuitively  expected;  iii)  the  character  of  the  pattern  formation  depends  on  the  direction  of 

underlying tilted wave. This property contrast strongly with the elliptical case due to rotational 

invariance  of  the  elliptic  CSHE.  In  hyperbolic  case  the  rotational  invariance  is  broken,  as  seen 

from both hyperbolic equations (2,3), and as illustrated in the Fig.1.  

Next,  we  numerically  check  the  predictions  of  the  above  analysis  of  order  parameter 

equation (2) and amplitude equation (4) by solving numerically the full hyperbolic MBE (1). In 

order to ensure the stability of the solutions, we added phenomenologically a small diffusion in 

MBE, i.e., the differential operator was used of the form 

ˆ
Li
1,1

+-

ˆ
Lg

 with 

1<<g

. Physically the 

diffusion  in  optical  systems  corresponds  to  the  spatial  frequency  filtering  present  in  most 

systems, and can be considered small compared with the diffraction. In our numerical study, the 

diffusion/diffraction  ratio  is  fixed  to 

,  but  the  results  depend  only  negligibly  on  this 

=g

310 -

ratio.  We  consider  a  system  of  large  size  compared  to  the  scale  of  the  selected  pattern.  The 

characteristic size of the dissipative nonlinear optical system is characterized by the dissipative 

Fresnel number F, which for the MBE (1) with normalized parameters is equal to the square of 
(cid:181)F

integration region, and for our  calculations is 

. In terms of experimentally accessible

system, L – full resonator length,  l  - the wavelength and  Q  is finesse of the resonator), which is 

equal  to  the  usual  Fresnel  number  divided  by  the  resonator  finesse.  The  dissipative  Fresnel 

number  is  a  measure  of  a  maximal  number  of  dissipative  structures  (e.g.,  vortices)  that  can  be 

placed  independently  (or  weakly  dependently)  one  from  another  within  the  aperture  (or  within 

the integration range with periodic boundaries). The dissipative Fresnel number was sufficiently 

large in our numerical calculations (F=900) thus the influence of used periodic boundaries was 

negligible.  In  this  case,  the  distance  between  the  closest  eigenvalues  of  the  linear  problem  is 

negligibly small, leading to the quasicontinuous spectrum the D’Alambert operator. We mention 

that  in  the  opposite  limit  of  for  conservative  system  with 

ﬁQ

  (resulting  in 

ﬁF

0

)  the 

boundaries influence critically the spatiotemporal light dynamics as shown in [19].  

The profile of the field intensity in 2D Fourier space during the linear stage of evolution is 

shown in Fig.2 for different values of detuning. The plots are given at a normalize time of 20, 

which means that the field intensity is still not saturated (population inversion still not depleted). 

The far field patterns  show formation of the hyperbola (Fig.2.a), as predicted. We note that the 

change the sign of detuning results in spatial orientation of the hyperbola as shown in the Fig.2.b. 

This  is  an  essential  difference  with  elliptical  systems  where  transverse  patterns  occur  for  only 

one  sign  of  detuning:  since  the  maximum  growth  rate  realizes  for 

k

2

  for  elliptical 

systems,  no  pattern  formation  is  possible  for  positive  detuning.  For  zero  detuning  hyperbola 

degenerates into two bisectrices

all spatial scales in this singular case. For 

 patterns can occur on scales

. 

The  transverse  profiles  of  hyperbolic  pattern  during  the  nonlinear  stage  of  evolution are 

shown in Fig.3. These structures consist of a remarkably robust parabolic patterns composed by 

several stretched vortices advected by the underlying tilted wave. The underlying tilted wave in 

Fig.3.a  is  directed  along  the  focus  line  of  the  hyperbola  (corresponds  to 

1k   in  Fig.1),  and  in 

Fig.3.b  is  directed  nearly  along  asymptotes  of  the  hyperbola  (corresponds  to 

2k   in  Fig.1).  An 

essential  difference  with  elliptical  systems  is  that  the  vortices  are  typically  strongly squeezed 

elliptic, and that the differently charged vortices have different intensity profiles. 

The  asymptotical  cases  shown  in  Fig.3.a  and  Fig.3.b  can  be  treated  analytically  by 

amplitude  equation.  For  case  of  Fig.3.a,  when  the  background  tilted  wave  is  nearly  along  y-

direction (corresponding to 

1k  in Fig.1), the NWSE (4) simplifies to:

instability “banana” for hyperbola and ellipse are similar, but just differently oriented in spatial 

Fourier  domain.  The  advection  in  the  Eq.  (5)  follows  in  opposite  direction,  i.e.,  antiparallel  to 

yk .  

For  case  of  Fig.3.b,  when  the  background  tilted  wave  is  nearly  along  asymptotes  of  the

where the instability area extends along the asymptote, and the advection occurs in the direction 

perpendicular to the underlying tilted wave.  

In summary, we predict hyperbolic light patterns in  nonlinear resonators, and in particular 

in  broad  aperture  lasers,  resulting  from  the  competition  between  hyperbolic  diffraction  and 

nonlinearities.  They  consist  of  patterns  residing  on  hyperbolas  in  far  field  configuration,  and 

consisting  of  stretched  vortices  in  near  field  configuration.  The  normal  form  reduction  of  the 

problem makes our analysis general: one can expect that the hyperbolic pattern constitute a class 

of  patterns  in  different  nonlinear  optical  resonators  such  as  optical  parametric  oscillators, 

photorefractive oscillators and others. A better understanding of hyperbolic patterns is therefore 

crucial to the advancement of knowledge of complex nonlinear systems.

directions, and stretching axes are at angle of almost 90 degrees. (b) Vortices for the case when 

the background tilted wave is nearly along the asymptote (corresponding to 

2k  in Fig.1). Note 

that differently charged vortices have different intensity distributions.

This paper presents a detailed numerical study of the effect of 

focusing on the conversion efficiency of low-loss singly-

resonant parametric oscillators with collinear focusing of 

pump and signal. Results are given for the maximal pump 

depletion and for pump power levels required for various 

amounts of depletion, as functions of pump and signal confocal 
parameters, for kI/kP=0.33 and 0.50. It is found that the ratio 

of pump depletion to maximal depletion as a function of the 

ratio of pump power to threshold power agrees with the plane-

wave prediction to within 5%, for a wide range of focusing 

conditions. The observed trends are explained as resulting 

from intensity and phase dependent mechanisms.

Introduction

The recent demonstrations of continuous-wave operation for singly-resonant 

optical parametric oscillators (SRO) with significant pump depletion in collinear 

focusing configurations [1-6] have stimulated renewed interest in these devices, and call 

for a more detailed analysis of diffractive effects. An exact calculation of thresholds for 
collinear focusing was presented in [7]. Theoretical studies of SROs above threshold so 

far have used the plane-wave [2,4,8] or lowest-order Gaussian mode [1,2,4,5,9] 

approximations. A numerical model of a pulsed SRO with strong birefringent walk-off 

is found in reference [10]. In [11], the author studied the effects of residual dispersion 

and diffraction on threshold, pump depletion and transverse mode content in a model of 

a low-loss SRO with collinear focusing at the center of the crystal, and a confocal 

parameter of signal and pump equal to the crystal length. It was found that the 

transverse mode content of the idler depends strongly on the residual dispersion, but 

only weakly on the amount of pump depletion. At optimal dispersion, about 77% of the 

total idler power is in the zero order radial mode, 22% in the first mode, and 1% in 

higher modes. Maximal pump depletion of 95.5% occurs at a pump power 2.52 times 

above threshold.

In this paper, we study the effect of various degrees of focusing for pump and 

signal on threshold and pump depletion for the same model. In section 1, we present the 

coupled wave-equations, define intrinsic units for the length scales and power, and 

discuss the numerical solution procedure. In section 2, we present our results for the 

maximal degree of pump depletion and for the  required pump power for threshold and 

various degrees of pump depletion as functions of the confocal parameters of pump and 

signal. In section 3, we discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed 

numerical trends. In section 4, we discuss the limitations of our model, and summarize 

our findings.

1.  Field  equations,  resonator  modeling  and  numerical  procedures

a.  Field  equations,  intrinsic  units  and  photon  conservation

The electric field EF and the total power PF of the pump, signal and idler fields 

(F=P,S,I) are given in terms of the complex field amplitude AF as:

EF=real(AFexp(iF F)),  F F=kFz-iw

t, kF=w FnF/c=2p nF/l F

(1)

PF=0.5nce 0 (cid:242) dxdy |AF|2

For steady-state continuous-wave operation, the coupled wave equations for the 

amplitudes AF in a second-order non-linear medium are:

AF,z = (i/2kF)(AF,xx + AF,yy) + QF

(2)

QP=i k Pexp(-iD z)AIAS, QS=i k S exp(iD z)APAI*, QI=i k I exp(iD z)APAS* ,

k F=w Fd/nFc=2p d/nFl F, D =kP-kS-kI-2p

/l.

Here d is the non-linear coefficient, and D =kP-kS-kI-2p

/l is the residual 

dispersion for a periodically poled crystal with poling period l. The subscripts x,y and z 

denote partial differentiation with respect to the corresponding spatial coordinates. For 
example, for periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) at l P=1.06 m m, one has approximately 
d=14 and n=2.2. To facilitate the application of our numerical data to various 
experimental situations, we introduce arbitrary units of propagation distance z0 and 

wave-vector k0, which define corresponding units r0, AF0 and PF0 for the radial 

distance, complex amplitude and power as follows:

r02=z0/k0 , AP0=1/(z0(cid:214)

Sk I), AS0=1/(z0(cid:214)

Pk I), AI0=1/(z0(cid:214)

Sk P)

(3)

With these units, the wave equations 2 and the expression for the beam power PF 

take the form:

A'P,z' =  (i/2k'P)(A'P,x'x' + A'P,y'y')  +  i  exp(-iD

'z')A'IA'S ,

A'I,z'  =  (i/2k'I)(  A'I,x'x' +  A'I,y'y')  +  i  exp(  iD

'z')A'PA'S* ,

A'S,z' =  (i/2k'S)(A'S,x'x' + A'S,y'y')  +  i  exp(  iD

'z')A'PA'I* ,

The units P0F of power are related by:

l P P0P = l

I P0I = l S P0S.

The dimensionless quantities rF are proportional to the total rates of photons 

passing through the crystal in unit time. They satisfy the following relationships, which 

are expressions of photon number conservation:

 d(rP +rI)/dz'  =  d(rP + rS)/dz'  =  d(rS - rI)/dz'  =  0.

In our following analysis, we set z0=L/2, where L is the crystal length, and 

k0=kP. In this case, the unit P0P of pump power is given by:

P0P=e 0 c nS nI l S l I l P/(8p 2 d2 L) = 3.352 104 nS nI l S l I l P/(d2 L) ,

(8)

[l ] = m m , [d] = pm/V , [L] = mm, [P0P] = Watt .

The expressions in square brackets denote the units for which the above 

numerical expression is valid. The unit P0P of pump power is related to the quantity K3 

(6)

(9)

of reference [7] by:

P0P = 8/((1 + l S/l P) K3).

b.  Resonator  modeling

We now use the photon conservation equations 7 to derive relationships between 

resonator input and output in a SRO with a low-loss ring resonator. We denote the 
photon rates at the input and output faces of the crystal by rFin and rFout. Then the 

following relationships hold:

rIin   = 0, 

rSin   = rS, 

rPin   = rP, 

(10)

rIout = rI, 

rSout = rS + rI, 

rPout = rP - rI .

If T<<1 is the total resonator loss for the signal, one has

rSin  = (1-T) rSout  @

 rS + rI - TrS,  rI =  TrS << rS.

(11)

In this case, the total signal power in the cavity stays almost constant. If the input 

pump beam is a zero order radial mode (Gaussian), the zero order radial signal mode 

has lowest threshold. We found that the threshold for the first radial signal mode is 

about four times the threshold for the zero order mode. Therefore, it is a valid 

approximation to replace the signal amplitude in equations 4.a and 4.b by the amplitude 

corresponding to a zero order mode with constant total power. Equations 4.a and 4.b 

are then linear in the pump and idler amplitude, and the total idler output power is a 
linear function of pump input power, with a conversion coefficient D(rS) depending on 

the signal power:

rI  =  D(rS) rP.

(12)

From equations 11 and 12, the pump depletion DP and pump power are obtained 

as functions of rS as:

DP = rI/rP = D(rS),   

(13.a)

rP= rI/D(rS) = T rS/D(rS) = T RP , PP=rPP0P=RPTP0P.

(13.b)

The normalized pump power RP as a function of rS depends only on the focusing 

geometry and ratio of idler to pump wave length, while all dependence on the resonator 
loss and the non linear coefficient is contained in T and P0P. In the limit of rS -> 0, 

equation 13.b gives the normalized threshold pump power Rthr.The gain coefficient 

D(rS)  is calculated numerically by the procedure described below.

c.  Numerical  algorithms  and  parameters

Equations 4.a and 4.b were integrated numerically by a split step algorithm, with 

an explicit half-step of parametric conversion followed by a full step of diffraction and 

an implicit half step of conversion. The diffraction step uses the Cayley transform of a 

discrete version of the radial Laplacian which conserves photon number. This 

procedure is unconditionally stable [12]. The use of the radial Laplacian restricts us to 

radially symmetric beams, which is a reasonable approximation for many experimental 

situations. It results in a considerable reduction in computation time as compared to a 

full two-dimensional transverse integration.

As discussed above, the signal beam was set to a Gaussian with constant power rS 

throughout the crystal. The amplitude of the pump beam at the crystal entry face was 
set to be that of a Gaussian with unit power rP = 1.0, while the amplitude of the idler 

beam was set to zero. The total output power of the idler at the crystal exit face was 
calculated for a sequence of values rS of signal power, to give the conversion or pump 

depletion coefficient D(rS), according to equation 12. At each value of rS, the residual 
dispersion parameter D
 was adjusted to give maximal idler output power. Equations 
13.a and 13.b were then used to obtain the pump depletion D(RP) as a function of the 

actual normalized pump input power RP corresponding to the specified values of signal 

power rS, according to the resonator condition, equation 11.

We verified our numerical procedure extrinsic by propagating zero and first 

order radial modes without conversion, and plane wave beams with full conversion. 

Agreement of the numerical beam amplitudes with the known analytical solutions was 

better than 0.1 % of the maximal amplitudes, for the choice of radial and longitudinal 

step sizes given below. Larger errors occurred for confocal parameters smaller than 

about one half the crystal length at radial distances where the beam amplitudes had 

decreased to less than about 5% of their maximal values and longitudinal distances more 

than a Raleigh range from focus. These parts of the beam profile contribute less than 

0.25% of the total beam power, and the errors were therefore tolerated. In [11], we 

also found very close agreement between the numerical results obtained from the 

procedure described here, and a numerical integration of coupled mode equations. 

Furthermore, the threshold power calculated was found to agree with the results of 
reference [7].

Intrinsic verification was obtained by reducing the radial and longitudinal step 

sizes by one half, resulting in changes of less than 0.2% of the calculated idler power, 

which is consistent with the results from the extrinsic verification described above. The 

crystal length L was defined to be two units of length: L=2L0 , and was divide into 80 

integration steps. For the smallest pump confocal parameter bP=0.3L considered here, 

this gives 24 steps for the region within on Raleigh range from the focus. With a unit 
k0=kP of wave vector, a pump beam with bP=L=2L0 has a waist radius of w=1.4w0 

units w0 of radial distance. We chose the maximal radial distance to be 14 units, and the 

number of radial integration steps to be 200. This gives 20 steps within the waist radius 
for bP=L, and more than 10 steps for bP=0.3L.

The signal power rS was increased from rS=0.0001 by 0.2 to a final value of 

4.0001. Maximal conversion was found in the range of rS=2.8 to 3.2. From the 

resulting discrete series of pump depletion or conversion coefficients the maximal 

conversion and pump power levels at fixed conversion were determined by 

interpolation.

2.  Numerical  results  for  pump  depletion  and  pump  power  levels

Figures 1 to 9 summarize results for various parameters, which characterize the 

conversion efficiency of the SRO as functions of the inverse focusing parameter 
zP'=zP/L0=bP/L. Figures 1 to 6 present results for fixed signal confocal parameter 

zS'=bS/L, with figures 1 to 3 for the case kI/kP=0.33 and figures 4 to 6 for kI/kP=0.50. 

Figures 7 to 9 give corresponding results for the case where the pump and signal 
confocal parameters are equal: zP'=zS'.

a.  Results  for  kI/kP=0.33,  bS/L=1.0,  0.7  and  0.5.

Figure 1 shows the maximal pump depletion Dmax as a function of zP', for 

zS'=1.0, 0.7 and 0.5. The largest value is always found at zP' smaller than or equal to 

zS'. For example, at zS'=1.0, Dmax peaks between zP'=0.8 and 0.9 at about 0.965, while 

for zS'=0.5, the peak value of 0.977 is found at zP'=0.5. Thus, for maximal conversion, 

it is necessary to focus the pump not less tightly than the signal. The penalty for 
violating this requirement is not severe, however. For zS'=1.0, one stays within 5% of 

the peak value, that is above 0.91, for zP' in the range from 0.5 to 1.5.

Figure 2 shows the pump power levels RP at which maximal depletion Dmax and 

95% of maximal depletion, D=0.95Dmax, are achieved. For zS'=1.0, the lowest pump 

level required is RP=3.12 for maximal depletion, and RP=2.34 for 95% of maximal 

depletion. The corresponding value of zP' is between 0.7 and 0.8, somewhat below the 

value at which Dmax peaks. For zS'=0.5, the minimal levels are lower: RP=2.87 and 

2.12, and they occur for the same zP'=0.5 as for peak Dmax.

Figures 3.a to 3.c show the pump levels RP required to reach threshold D=0.0, 

and the values D=0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. The threshold values agree with those published 
in [7] (see also [10]). Minimal power levels are found in the same range for zP' as in 

figure 2: zP'=0.7 to 0.8 for zS'=1.0 (figure 3.a), zP'=0.6 for zS'=0.7 (figure 3.b) and 

zP'=0.5 for zS'=0.5  (figure  3.c).

Figure 3.d finally gives the ratio PP/Pthr=RP/Rthr of pump power at D=0.95Dmax 

(figure 2) to threshold power (figures 3.a to 3.c). It is very interesting to note that this 

ratio falls into a narrow range from 1.99 to 2.07, a variation of only 4%. Thus, as a 
rule of thumb for a wide range of focusing conditions one expects D=0.95Dmax to 

occur at about 2 times above threshold. Violation of this rule will indicate the presence 

of nonlinear effects other than parametric conversion.

b.  Results  for  kI/kP=0.50,  bS/L=1.0,  0.7  and  0.5.

Figures 4 to 6 present corresponding results for the degenerate case 

kI/kP=kS/kP=0.50. The maximal depletion Dmax is somewhat higher than for 

kI/kP=0.33, although not by a large amount. For zS'=0.5, it peaks just below Dmax=0.98 

at zP'=0.5.

The pump levels are lower than for kI/kP=0.33. For example, at zS'=0.5, the 

minimal level for D=0.95Dmax is RP=2.18, while it is RP=2.34 for kI/kP=0.33. The 

same trend is found for the relative pump power levels P/Pthr at D=0.95Dmax, shown in 

figure 6.d. These lie in the range from 1.93 to 1.99, as compared to the range 1.99 to 
2.07 for kI/kP=0.33.

c.  Results  for  bS=b P,  kI/kP=0.33,  0.50.

Figures 7 to 9 present results for the case where signal and pump have equal 
confocal parameter. Peak Dmax and lowest power levels are found for tighter focusing, 

around zP'=zS'=0.4. The degenerate case kI/kP=0.50 requires significantly lower pump 

power levels for given depletion D than kI/kP=0.33 at tighter focusing zP'=zS'<1.0, 

while for larger confocal parameters the difference is less. Differences in Dmax 
between the two cases are less than 1% for all values of zP'=zS'.

d.  Relative  pump  depletion  as  a  function  of  relative  pump  power.

Figure 10 gives the relative depletion D/Dmax as a function of relative pump 

power P/Pthr, showing one near optimal case each for kI/kP=0.33 and 0.50, and the 

result of the plane wave theory. The curve for kI/kP=0.50 follows the plane wave curve 

more closely, staying below the plane wave curve until Dmax is reached, and declining 
more gradually afterwards. This behavior is more pronounced for kI/kP=0.33.

All three curves agree to better than 5% up to 4 times above threshold. 

Furthermore, all other cases covered in this study fall within the same range. This 

result shows that the influenced of various focusing configurations is mostly accounted 
for by the dependence of pump threshold Pthr (figures 3,6 and 9) and maximal depletion 

Dmax (figures 1,4 and 7). With these two parameters, the conversion D at any pump 

power level P is predicted to within 5% by scaling to the plane wave formula:

D(P/Pthr) = Dmax Dpw (P/Pthr)

(14)

Here Dpw(P') is the pump depletion for plane wave beams at D

'=0 as a function 

of the ratio P'=P/Pthr of pump power to threshold power. According to ref. [8], this is 

defined implicitly by giving Dpw and P' as functions of the signal amplitude A'S (see 

equations 4.a and 4.b):

Dpw(A'S)  =  sin(A'SL')2,   P'= (AS'L')2/sin(AS'L')2,    L'=L/z0.

(15)

The maximal pump depletion for plane wave beams at D

'=0 is Dpw max=1.0.

3.  Intensity  and  phase  dependent  effects  of  focusing

The dependence of SRO conversion on focusing results from both intensity and 

phase sensitive mechanisms.

Intensity dependence is given by the fact that tighter focusing leads to higher field 

amplitudes, and thereby to enhanced nonlinear conversion. This effect is 

counterbalanced by the reduction in effective gain length which results from stronger 

beam spreading. The latter effect dominates at very short confocal parameters. These 
combined effects are most clearly seen in figure 7 to 9, for the case zP'=zS'.

If zP'=zS', the nonlinear polarization at the idler wave length has a radial phase 

dependence which, as a function of propagation distance, is that of a Gaussian with the 

same constant confocal parameter and location of focus as the pump and signal, as long 

as the pump retains its Gaussian form. Therefore, conversion can be phase matched to a 
zero order idler mode. On the other hand, if  zP' is different from zS', the radial phase 

dependence of the non-linear polarization does not correspond to that of a zero order 

idler mode, and phase matching is frustrated. Therefore, smaller gain than in the phase 

matched case results, and one expects that higher pump levels are required for threshold 

and depletion. Also, higher transverse idler modes are expected to be generated more 
strongly, leading to a corresponding reduction in maximal depletion Dmax, since the 

different transverse modes reach maximal power at different levels of signal power.

These qualitative arguments are supported by the focusing dependence of Dmax 

and required pump levels discussed earlier. For example, Dmax in figures 1 and 4 peaks 

at values of zP' close to zS'. Furthermore, for zP'>0.7, tighter focusing of the signal 

beam leads to a decrease in Dmax, and for zP'>0.9 also to an increase in required pump 

power (figures 2 and 5). This is contrary to what would be expected on the basis of 

intensity dependent effects only, and results form the increasing radial phase mismatch. 
For zP'<0.7, on the other hand, tighter focusing of the signal beam increases both the 

signal amplitude and the degree of radial phase match, and therefore gives higher Dmax 

and lower required pump power.

The dependence of higher radial idler mode content on focusing is demonstrated 
in table 1 below, which shows the maximal depletion Dmax and the relative power in the 

zero order radial mode for kI/kP=0.50, zS'=1.0 and zP'=0.4, 0.8 and 1.5. Best phase 

matching occurs for zP'=0.8, which has highest Dmax and highest content of zero order 

radial modes. For calculation of radial mode amplitudes, the confocal parameter of the 

idler modes was set equal to the pump confocal parameter, and focus located at the 

crystal center.

4.  Summary  and  conclusion

In this paper, we presented detailed numerical results for the focusing dependence 

of the maximal pump depletion and of the required pump levels for various degrees of 

pump depletion in SROs. We found that maximal depletion occurs for values of the 

pump confocal parameter slightly less than or equal to the signal confocal parameter. 

The focusing dependence of conversion and required power levels is mostly contained 
in the values of pump threshold Pthr and maximal depletion Dmax. The relative 

depletion D/Dmax as a function of relative pump power P/Pthr is equal to the result from 

the plane wave theory to within 5%. In particular, D=0.95Dmax is achieved at about 2 

times above threshold.

Both intensity and phase dependent effects are important. If the confocal 

parameters of pump and signal are almost equal, the focusing dependence of maximal 

conversion and threshold is due mostly to the dependence of signal amplitude and 

effective gain length. For larger differences between confocal parameters, the radial 

phase mismatch is the dominant factor, and conversion increases with reduced phase 

mismatch, even if a decrease in signal amplitude is involved.

These results present a simple quantitative and qualitative account of the main 

effects of diffraction in SROs, which can be used to easily predict and assess the 

performance of focused beam based SROs. The main limitations of our model are: a) 

restriction to radially symmetric beams and zero order pump and signal beams, and b) 

neglect of any nonlinear effects other than parametric conversion and dispersion. In 

particular, thermal effects and resulting radial changes in refractive index may be of 

importance in continuous-wave SROs [13].

It is a pleasure to acknowledge interesting discussions about the topics presented 

here with W. Bosenberg-who stimulated our interest in SROs-, R. Byer and M. Fejer.

Abstract 

We present results on THGEM operation at low gas pressures, in the range 0.5-50 Torr. Gaseous 
gain up to 105 was recorded at 10 Torr of Isobutane in a single multiplier element, with pulses 

rise-time in the few ns range. Cascaded operation of two THGEMs is reported, with similar total 

gain  but  at  lower  voltages  on  each  element.  The  present  work  encompasses  a  large  variety  of 

THGEM  geometries  and  includes  electric-field  distribution  calculations  and  electron  transport 

simulations. We discuss the operation mechanism and some possible applications of THGEMs at 

low gas pressures.

1. Introduction 

The THGEM presented in the previous, related article [1], is based on avalanche multiplication 

in  independent  holes,  arranged  in  a  compact  array.  The  holes,  of  0.3  -  2  mm  diameter,  are 

mechanically drilled in a Cu-clad double-sided 0.4 – 3.2 mm thick G-10 plate, and then the Cu is 

etched to produce a 0.1 mm clearance from the hole rim. Radiation-induced electrons, deposited 

in  the  gas  gap  above  the  THGEM  or  produced  in  a  solid  converter  placed  above  or  deposited 

directly  on  the  THGEM  top  face,  drift  towards  the  THGEM  holes.  The  strong  dipole  electric 

field established in the holes by the potential difference between the two THGEM faces, focuses 

the electrons into the holes, whereby they are multiplied in the strong Ehole field. An extraction 

field in the gap below the THGEM is responsible for the charge collection onto a readout anode 

or  another  multiplying  electrode;  a  reversed  extraction  field  will  divert  all  charges  to  the 

THGEM bottom. The THGEM’s operation principle is similar to that of the standard GEM [2], 

with the main advantages of suppressed photon-mediated secondary processes and true pixilated 

operation; the large hole dimensions result in electrode robustness, better electron focusing into 

the holes and higher total gains but coarser localization and somewhat slower pulses.       

The  previous  article  [1]  presented  our  systematic  study  of  the  properties  of  these  devices 

operated  with  various  gases  at  atmospheric  pressure;  therefore  it  concentrated  mostly  on 

THGEMs of a geometry that is the most appropriate for atmospheric pressure applications, e.g. 

having  a  thickness  of  0.4  mm.  A  previous  study  [3]  described  in  some  detail  results  obtained 

with a 1.6 mm thick electrode operated at atmospheric and at low gas pressures.  

An important range of applications exists at low gas pressures, down to the sub-Torr values, for 

which the THGEM might be a very appropriate solution. Examples are in detection of heavily 

ionizing  radiation  with  very  low  penetration,  e.g.  heavy  particles  in  nuclear  reactions.  We  are 

currently investigating the application of THGEMs for the readout of a low pressure (~100Torr) 

TPC  operating  in  an  Oxygen-rich  gas  mixture,  for  the  study  of  the  O(γ,α)C  reaction  in 

cosmologically-relevant  energy  range  [4].  Another  example  is  in  the  detection  of  very  low-

energy ions, recently proposed by us for track-structure studies in nanodosimetry applications. In 

this case the ions produced by the incident radiation in a model gas volume carry the information 

on the primary ionizations and their spatial correlations. For this purpose an imaging ion detector 

has to be developed that operates at sub-Torr gas pressure; the THGEM electron multiplier could 

become an important component of this ion detector.  

Nuclear physics experiments have been successfully applying traditional multiwire proportional 

chambers  (MWPCs)  and  parallel-plate  avalanche  chambers  (PPACs)  for  the  fast  and  efficient 

detection of heavily ionizing light and massive particles, at low gas pressures down to 1 Torr and 
below  [5-9].  It  was  shown  that  the  high  gains,  of  ~106  or  more,  reached  at  very  low  gas 

pressures, make MWPCs and multistep avalanche chambers suitable tools for the detection and 

imaging  of  single  electrons  [10]  and  single  photons  [11].  In  this  article  we  present  the  results 

obtained  with  various  THGEM  electrodes  operated  in  low-pressure  gases,  and  discuss  their 

properties.  This  article  is  preceded  by  Part  I  [1],  dedicated  to  the  general  description  of  the 

THGEM operation, methodology and properties at atmospheric pressure. 

  

2. Methodology 

Like  our  studies  at  atmospheric  pressure,  the  methodology  encompassed  electric-field 

calculations (MAXWELL) [12], electron-transport and avalanche simulations (GARFIELD) [13] 

and  experimental  investigations.  The  electrode  production  and  the  investigated  geometries  as 

well  the  detailed  description  of  the  methodology  are  provided  in  [1].  It  should  be  noted  that 

unlike  atmospheric  pressure,  GARFIELD  electron-transport  simulations  at  the  low-pressure 

range did not match quantitatively the experimental data; the reason is yet unknown to us. 

Our  low-pressure  operation  studies  included  THGEM  electrodes  coupled  to  semitransparent 

photocathodes (STPC) placed above the THGEM or reflective ones (RefPC) deposited on the top 

face of the THGEM. We deposited CsI photocathodes of 30 or 300nm thickness for the STPC 

and the RefPC, respectively. The first was deposited on a quartz window pre-coated with a thin 

(3nm)  Cr  contact  layer.  We  employed  continuous  or  pulsed  UV  light  sources,  and  recorded 

currents  from  various  electrodes  with  the  help  of  a  precision  electrometer  (KIETHLY  610C). 

Individual power supplies were used on each electrode, to allow maximum powering flexibility. 

Multipliers  comprising  single-  and  double-THGEM  elements  were  investigated;  in  the  latter 

configuration the electrodes were mounted at least 6-10 mm apart. More details are provided in 

[1].   

The experiments included mainly absolute effective gain (AEG) measurements with single and 

double-THGEMs.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  gain  is  measured  by  recording  currents  at  the 

bottom electrode of the THGEM and not on a readout anode as common in the literature. In a 

single  THGEM  the  AEG  is  defined  as  the  product  of  the  efficiency  to  transport  the  primary 

electron from its creation point into the holes (electron transfer efficiency, ETE) and the absolute 

gaseous multiplication in the holes. In a double-THGEM cascade the AEG includes the absolute 

multiplication  in  both  THGEMs  and  the  efficiency  to  transport  the  electron  from  its  creation 

point  to  the  first  THGEM  holes  (ETE)  as  well  as  the  efficiency  to  extract  it  from  the  first 

THGEM  into  the  holes  of  the  second  one.  When  gain  permitted,  we  recorded  single-

photoelectron fast pulses and registered their rise time. 

Figure 2 depicts the experimental scheme for AEG measurements, in the ST and Ref modes. It is 

done  by  DC  current  recording,  in  two  steps:  1)  the  normalization  step,  providing  the  total 

photocurrent  hitting  the  THGEM  top  face  and  2)  the  AEG  measurement,  providing  the  total 

electrons current collected at the THGEM bottom with a slightly reversed Etrans field below it. In 

the  AEG  step  the  field  Edrift  above  the  THGEM  was  kept  0  in  the  Ref  mode  and  typically  30 

V/cm·Torr in the ST mode. The ratio of the two currents provides the AEG. A similar scheme 

and procedure were used with double THGEMs: the normalization step was identical; the AEG 

step was performed with Etrans between the two elements set typically to ~20V/ cm·Torr. 

 

 

3. Results and discussion 

to this table.  

3.1 Electric-field calculations 

The  reader  is  referred  to  table  I  in  the  related  paper  [1],  which  summarizes  the  geometrical 

parameters of all THGEM electrodes used in this study. Their numbers in the following text refer 

Figure  3  shows  Ehole,  the  electric  filed  along  the  hole  axis,  calculated  by  MAXWELL  for  two 

different  THGEMs  for 

their  respective  optimal  operation  conditions  at  atmospheric 

(Ar/CO2(70:30))  and  at  low  pressure  (10  Torr  Isobutane).  The  THGEMs  are  those  found 

experimentally to yield the highest gain in the respective pressures: THGEM#9 with t=0.4 mm 

and  0.3  diameter  holes  is  suitable  for  atmospheric  pressure  operation  while  THGEM#4  or 

THGEM#6 with t=1.6mm and 1mm diameter holes are more appropriate for the p<50Torr range. 

The reader is referred to [1] for a more extended discussion on the electric-field systematics: e.g. 

the amount of field confinement as function of hole diameter (for a fixed plate thickness) and the 

effect of an external field (e.g. Edrift or Etrans) on the profile of Ehole. With the thicker plates and 

larger  hole  diameter  employed  at  low  pressure,  the  avalanche  spread  outside  the  holes  is 

expected to be more pronounced.   

 

 

3.2 Absolute effective gain 

Figures 4-9,12 summarize the results of absolute effective gain (AEG) measured at low-pressure 

Isobutane and Ar/CO2 (70:30). Six different THGEM geometries were investigated in 0.5,1,5,10, 

30  and  50  Torr.  In  general,  the  THGEMs  were  found  to  be  very  robust  under  low-pressure 

operation, and not a single THGEM was damaged during our extensive measurements. 

Figure 4 compares the AEGs of different THGEMs in 10 Torr Isobutane. THGEMs #1 and #2 

were  produced  by  drilling  the  PCB  plates  and  then  dipping  them  in  acid  to  smooth-out  sharp 

edges  in  the  Cu,  without  etching  a  clearance  in  the  copper  layer  around  the  hole  rims.  The 

additional etching stage of a 0.1mm clearance around the hole rim (added later to the production 

process), clearly improved the maximal gain by up to an order of magnitude (compare # 2 and 

#3).  THGEM#11  yielded  the  highest  gain  in  this  pressure,  and  no  advantage  was  gained  by 

increasing the thickness from 2.2 to 3.2 mm. Compared to the standard GEM, also shown in the 

figure, the THGEMs provide AEG of a few orders of magnitude higher.  

Figures 5 and 6 show AEG data measured at 1 and 0.5 Torr Isobutane, with different THGEMs. 

From Fig. 5 it is seen that all electrodes reach about the same maximal gain at 1 Torr; from Fig. 

6  it  is  seen  that  THGEM#1  (without  the  etched  clearance  around  the  hole)  yields  an  order  of 

magnitude  lower  gain  compared  to  the  other  electrodes.  Nevertheless,  the  maximal  AEG 

depends primarily on the gas pressure. This is evident from figures 7 and 8, comparing the gain 

of THGEMs #4 and #5, over the whole pressure range.   

Figure 9 compares the AEG measured with single- and double-THGEM#11 in Isobutane, in the 

pressure range of 0.5 – 10 Torr. It is noted that about the same maximal gain is obtained with the 

double-THGEM, but at a lower operation voltage on each THGEM; it is interesting to note that 

at  the  lowest  pressure  of  0.5  Torr,  the  single-THGEM  curve  deviates  from  proportionality 

already  at  an  effective  gain  of  100  but  with  double  THGEM  the  curve  reveals  proportional 
operation  up  to  the  maximal  effective  gain  of  104.  Double-THGEM  is  thus  more  proportional 

and  more  stable  than  single  THGEM  in  this  pressure  range.  When  cascading  two  THGEMs  at 

the low gas pressure conditions, it was found necessary to maintain a distance of the order of 6-

10mm  between  the  two  elements;  smaller  distances  resulted  in  very  unstable  operation  and 

sparks.  This  could  be  understood  in  terms  of  the  avalanche  extending  out  of  the  holes  at  high 

multiplication conditions and the overlap of the fields from the two THGEMs.  

Figures 10 and 11 show some AEG curves plotted on a linear scale; it accentuates the fact that 

the multiplications curves are parallel but there is a voltage shift of the multiplication onset as 

function  of  the  THGEM  geometry.  It  therefore  also  accentuates  the  dependence  of  gain 

uniformity on the THGEM fabrication precision.  

Figure 12 depicts the AEG measured with THGEM#4 in low pressure Ar/CO2(70:30). Compared 

to Isobutane, the operation voltages and the maximal attainable gains in this non-flammable gas 

are lower.   

The high gain obtained with the THGEMs permitted recording single-photoelectron signals with 

a  fast  (1ns  rise-time)  current  preamplifier.  Some  signals  are  shown  on  figure  13;  a)  a  single-

photoelectron  pulse,  recorded  with  THGEM#6  and  a  continuous  Hg(Ar)  lamp  at  10  Torr 

Isobutane, and b) a multi-photoelectron pulse, recorded with THGEM#5 and a pulsed H2 lamp at 

1 Torr Isobutane. Both pulses show similar rise times, of 5 – 6 ns; they are due to the high drift 

velocity  of  the  electrons  and  ions  in  the  high  reduced-electric  fields  (E/p)  in  these  operation 

conditions.  

 

4. Summary  

Within this work, various THGEMs with hole diameter of 1mm, thickness of 1.6 – 3.2 mm and 

hole distance of 1.5 – 7 mm were tested with Isobutane and Ar/CO2 (70:30), at low gas pressure 
in the range 0.5 – 50 Torr. Spark-free high effective gains, of 105 and 107, could be reached at 1 

and  10  Torr  Isobutane,  respectively;  the  signals  have  rise  times  of  typically  5-6  ns.  All  the 

THGEMs  tested  within  this  work  showed  very  high  robustness,  and  none  was  irreversibly 

damaged during operation. Spark-free double-THGEM operation was obtained when setting the 

transfer  gap  between  the  two  elements  to  ~6-10mm,  guaranteeing  sufficient  decoupling  of  the 

two  avalanche  processes;  this  wide  gap  is  required  probably  because  of  the  electric  filed  and 

avalanche  extension  outside  the  hole,  by  about  the  hole  diameter,  at  high  multiplication.  The 

total effective gain in double-THGEM mode is similar to that obtained with a single-THGEM, 

but  is  achieved  at  lower  operation  voltage;  this  results  in  lower  spark  probability  and  better 

proportionality, particularly at the very low gas pressures (e.g. 0.5 Torr).  

Large-area  THGEMs  of  almost  any  geometrical  shape  can  be  produced  with  economical 

standard  industrial  process,  over  a  large  range  of  geometrical  parameters  and  may  find  many 

applications  in  radiation  detection  and  imaging.  In  particular,  radiation  detection  in  the  low-

pressure range may benefit from these robust devices. Examples of applications exist in nuclear 

physics, at accelerators or in space, where low-energy (~MeV) ions produced in vacuum should 

be efficiently detected; their low penetrability allows only very thin dead-layers at the entrance 

of  the  detectors,  as  for  example  thin  windows  that  can  withstand  only  very  low  gas  pressures. 

Other  examples  are  the  detection  of  ions  for  various  environmental  or  atmospheric-quality 

monitoring.  In  all  cases  the  robust  low-pressure  THGEM  might  successfully  replace  the  more 

fragile wire-chambers, though with some compromise on timing and localization precision.

multiplication process deviates from proportionality at single-THGEM gain of a few 

hundreds.

In order to mitigate the effects of electrical breakdown 
(which  have  been  found  to  occur  in  SLAC  X-band 
traveling wave structures) standing wave structures are 
being  considered  for  the  NLC  linac.    At  SLAC, 
structures  consisting  of  15  cells  operating  in  the  π 
accelerating  mode  are being tested for their electrical 
breakdown  characteristics.    In  this  paper  the  tuning 
requirement on the cavities is elucidated by utilizing a 
circuit  model  of  the  structure.    The  sensitivity  of  the 
field  to  both  random  and  systematic  errors  is  also 
discussed. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 
In order to accelerate multiple bunches of electron (and 
positron)  beams  up  to  a  centre  of  mass  of  500GeV,  and  
later  up  to  1.0TeV  or  more,  travelling  wave  (R)DDS 
accelerator  structures  have  been  designed  and  tested  at 
SLAC and KEK [1].  However these structures have been 
found  to  suffer  from  electrical  breakdown  [2].  Recent 
design improvements, incorporating a reduced field on the 
surface  of  accelerating  cavities  and  a  reduced  group 
velocity  of  the  accelerating  mode  have  been  made  and  
these  have  been  found  to    reduce  the  number  of 
breakdown events substantially.  However, SW (Standing 
Wave)  structures  can  achieve  the  same  electron  beam 
energy  gain  at  significantly  reduced  gradients  compared 
to their travelling wave counterparts.  Initial experiments 
have  indicated  that  the  number  of  breakdowns  is  vastly 
reduced  in  SW  structures.      However,  in  fabricating 
several  tens  of  thousands  of  SW  structures,  as  will  be 
required for the NLC (Next Linear Collider), it important 
to have a knowledge of the tuning characteristics of these 
structures  as  well  as  the  sensitivity  of  the  field  to  errors. 
This is investigated in the sections 2 and 3.   

2 CIRCUIT MODEL OF SW STRUCTURE 

2.1 Lumped circuit model of coupled cavities 

In  order  to  calculate  the  modal  frequencies  and  the 
flatness  of  the  field  we  utilize a lumped circuit model of 
the  N+1  coupled  cavities  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.      In  the 
designs  under  consideration  at  SLAC  we  have 
incorporated  15  cells  operating  at  a  π  mode  accelerating 
frequency of 11.424GHz, driven with RF field through the

full cell boundary conditions: i-1 = i0 and iN+1 = iN. 
     In  the  test  structures  being  built  at  SLAC  kn-1/2=kn+1/2/

to  detune  and  damp  the  dipole  modes.    We  make  the 
approximation that all reactive variation between cavities 
occurs  in  the  inductance  (i.e.  the  cell  capacitances  are 
fixed)  and  small 
frequency  perturbations  will  be 
considered  in  this  analysis.        For  identical  cells  eq.  2.2

all  mistuned  structures,  we  solve 
the  non-linear 
eigensystem corresponding to eq 2.2.  An iterative scheme 
converges very rapidly to the solution for the eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors when the Q values are large (as is true in 
practice where the Ohmic Q~8000).

Several  structures  have  been  fabricated  and  tuned,  but 
here we present the results of measuring the field profile, 

 
via a bead pull technique, of SW20565 (a 15 cell structure 
in  which  the  iris  radius  is  5.65mm).    The  field  profile at 
each  stage  of  the  tuning  process  is  shown  in  Fig.  2 
beginning  the  tuning  at  A  and  ending  at  D.     In order to 
calculate the frequency mistuning of the cells we wrote a 
Fortran  computer  code  to  minimize  the  “cost”  function, 
defined as the difference between the sum of the squares 
of  the  circuit  model  eigenvectors  and  those  of  the 
experimentally determined field amplitude at each cell.

where Yc  is the admittance of the circuit viewed from the 
cavity circuit and β is the  coupling coefficient defined as 
the ratio of the power coupled into the cavity to the power 
dissipated in the walls of the coupler.   The admittance Yc 
is  evaluated  by  taking  the  circuit  of  Fig.  1  and  feeding 
current  into  the  middle  cell  and  calculating  the  voltage 
dropped  across  the  equivalent  reactive  element.    As  we

agreement is seen to be very good.  As the SW structure is

3 FABRICATION  ERRORS  AND  THEIR 
INFLUENCE ON FIELD FLATNESS 

3.1 Systematic frequency errors 

In fabricating the structures a frequency error (δf) that 
is repeatable from cell-to-cell is classified as a systematic 

 
error.    This error can be fixed by either retuning all the 
cavities to the correct resonance frequency or by placing a 
limited number of tuners within the accelerator and tuning 
the  resonance  frequency  back  to  accelerating  frequency.  
We have investigated several tuning schemes, but here we 
report  on  tuning  the  first  and  last  cells  together  with  the 
middle cell.  The first and last cells are tuned by: -δnδf/2 
(where δn is number of cells present between tuners) and 
the  middle  cell  is  tuned  by  δnδf.    This  results  in  the 
to  within 
accelerating 
100KHz.    The  resulting  on-axis  field  profiles  for  several 
systematic errors are shown in Fig 5.

of 0.5MHz (lowermost curve, magenta), 1, 2, and 3 MHz 
(uppermost curve, blue) included in the simulation.  The 
maximum deviation of the field from perfectly flat is 
included on each of the curves and in parentheses an 
approximate result for the maximum deviation obtained 
from the analytic formula 

An  analytical  formula  for  the  maximum  amplitude 
deviation  along  the  complete  structure  can  derived  from 
the dispersion equation by considering the frequency shift 
in terms of the phase induced in the structure: 

δ =

f (

where φ is the phase advance per period along a structure

with  systematic  frequency  errors  and  ∆f (=
bandwidth  of the structure.  The phase difference is then 
given by:

Applying  this  approximate  formula  to  the  field  in  Fig  5 
for a 1 MHz error gives a 3.1% field droop compared to 
3.2%  obtained  from  the  exact  calculation  and  thus  this 
analytical result is certainly accurate enough to be used as 
a  design  tool  to  estimate  how  large  the  field  droop  is 
liable  to  be  in  a  structure  with  limited  tuners.    The 
 

(3.1) 

(3.2) 

(3.3) 

 

 

accuracy  of  this  formula,  of  course  improves  as  the 
systematic  frequency  error  is  reduced  and  as  the  number 
of tuners is increased.  

3.2 Random frequency errors 

Random errors are introduced into each of the cells of 
the 15-cell structure and the field profile is recorded.   In 
order to tune-up the field back to its original perfectly flat 
initial state we allow only three tuners to be used.  These 
tuners  are  situated  in  the  first,  last  and  middle  cavities.  
We seek to minimise the “cost” parameter, defined as the  
sum  of  the  squares  of  the  differences  of  the  field  from 
perfectly  flat.    And  to this end, a computer program was 
written  to  automatically  minimize  the  cost  parameter.   
Introducing 
frequency  errors  which  are  uniformly 
distributed  with  an  RMS  error  of  3MHz  results  in  field 
distribution  which  deviates  from  perfectly  flat  with  an 
RMS  of  4%.    This  result  was  obtained  through  50 
simulations and is the mean deviation of the RMS of the 
deviation of the field from unity.  
    A typical result of this automated field tuning process is 
shown  in  Fig.  6.    The  field  prior  to  tuning  has  an  RMS 
deviation  from  unity  of  17.8%  and  after  tuning  it  has  an 
RMS deviation of 1.6%.  The frequency detuning required   
of the cells is shown inset to the figure and it is seen to be 
8MHz  for  the  centre  cell  and  2MHz  for  the  end  cell.  
These  small  frequency  tunings  are  readily  achievable  in 
practise with small tuning screws attached to the cavities.

For  the  purpose  of  laser  wakefield  acceleration,  it  turned  out  that  also  the  injection  of 

electron  bunches  longer  than  a  plasma  wavelength  can  generate  accelerated  femtosecond 

bunches  with  relatively  low  energy  spread.  This  is  of  high  interest  because  such  injecting 

bunches can be provided, e.g., by state-of-the-art photo cathode RF guns. Here we point out 

that  when  an  e-bunch  is  injected  in  the  wakefield  it  is  important  to  take  into  account  the 

ponderomotive  scattering  of  the  injecting  bunch  by  the  laser  pulse  in  the  vacuum  region 

located in front of the plasma. At low energies of the injected bunch this scattering results in 

a  significant  drop  of  the  collection  efficiency.  Larger  collection  efficiency  can  by  reached 

with lower intensity laser pulses and relatively high injection energies. We also estimate the 

minimum trapping energy for the injected electrons and the length of the trapped bunch.

In  Laser  Wakefield  Accelerator  (LWFA)  a  femtosecond  high-power  laser  pulse 

generates  a  strong  plasma  wave  (laser  wakefield)  which  can  accelerate  charged  particles  to 

ultra-relativistic energies [1]. In order to avoid large energy spread in accelerated bunch when 

a relativistic electron bunch is injected in the laser wakefield, the bunch has to be injected at a 

suitable position in the wake with a precision of a fraction of the plasma wave period and the 

duration of the injected bunch has to be similarly short. For the plasma parameters of interest, 

which  involves  typical  plasma  wavelength  of  a  few  tens  of  microns,  this  requires  initial 

bunches  of  the  order  of  10  femtoseconds  duration  and  a  similar  precision  of  the 

synchronization with the wakefield. With current technologies these requirements cannot be 

fulfilled  in  practice.  As  an  alternative,  in  the  recently  demonstrated  “bubble”  injection 

method  [2]  electrons  from  the  background  plasma  are  trapped  in  the  correct  phase  of  the 

wake yielding the required ultra-short bunches. This method led to acceleration to energies of 

1

 

 

 

 

the  order  of  100  MeV  with  relatively  low  energy  spread.  However,  the  shot-to-shot 

reproducibility was reported to be poor so far. Correspondingly, other injection schemes have 

been  proposed  aiming  on  a  better  control  of  the  experimental  conditions.  Among  these 

controlled  injection  methods  are  all-optical  methods  [3],  when  electrons  from  the  plasma 

itself can be trapped and accelerated by the use of additional laser pulse(s). 

 

Recently it turned out that a relatively long (longer than plasma wavelength) external 

electron-bunch  can  be  used  in  LWFA  as  an  injected  bunch  [4-8].  Simulations  showed  that, 

under certain conditions, electrons from the bunch can be trapped in a small region near the 

axis. The trapped bunch is accelerated in the wakefield, and this should result in an extremely 

short output bunches with a few microns in sizes, with high energy (hundreds of MeV’s), and 

with relatively low energy spread (in the order of one or a few percents). The injecting few-

MeV’s  e-bunch  can  be  obtained  from  state-of-the-art  RF  photo  injectors.  This  determines 

high interest in the external e-bunch injection schemes for LWFA. 

In this paper we point out that when an electron bunch is injected in the wakefield just 

behind  the  laser  pulse  [7,8]  one  has  to  take  into  account  the  following  fact.  Because  the 

electron bunch propagates slower than the laser pulse in vacuum, at some distance before the 

plasma  (actually  in  vacuum)  the  bunch  becomes  situated  in  front  of  the  laser  pulse  (this 

situation  is  schematically  depicted  in  Fig.  1).  Therefore  the  bunch  is  exposed  to  the  laser 

pulse while traveling through vacuum and one has to take into consideration the interaction of 

the injecting bunch and the pulse before both enter the plasma. The distance from the plasma 

2=1/(1− βb

2)>>1  one  has  Lc≈2γ0

at  which  the  bunch  and  the  pulse  start  to  overlap,  Lc  (catching  distance),  can  be  calculated 
from  the  following  expression:  Lc=(lb+lL)/(1−βb),  where  lb  (lL)  is  the  length  of  the  e-bunch 
(laser  pulse),  βb=vb/c  is  the  bunch  velocity  normalized  to  the  speed  of  light.  When 
2(lb+lL),  here  γ0  is  the  relativistic  factor  of  the  injecting 
γ0
bunch. For example, when the kinetic energy of  the  initial bunch is 1.6 MeV (γ0≈4.13) and 
lb+lL≈180  µm  (parameters  from  Fig.  5  in  Ref.  [7]),  the  catching  distance  is  ≈6  mm.  For 
comparison, the Rayleigh length, ZR=πw0
2/λL, is ≈3.5 mm for a laser spot radius w0=30 µm 
and laser wavelength λL=0.8  µm, which are typical values for simulations and experiments. 

So,  in  this  example,  when  the  bunch  passes  through  the  pulse,  the  laser  intensity  is 

comparable  with  its  value  in  the focus.  Thus,  at sufficiently  high  intensity  in  the  focus,  the 

ponderomotive force [9] might lead to strong scattering of the bunch before injection into the 

wakefield. In this paper we are aimed to take this effect into account. It is also clear that at 

higher  initial  energies  of  the  e-bunch,  the  major  part  of  the  bunch  interacts  with  the  laser 

 

2

pulse  at  relatively  large  distance  from  the  focus  (the  entrance  of  the  plasma)  where  the 

ponderomotive  force  is  weak,  so  that  the  effect  of  the  ponderomotive  scattering  could  be 

small. 

 

First,  let  us  estimate  such  important  parameters  of  the  problem  as  the  minimum 

trapping energy for injecting electrons and the length of a trapped bunch, which determines 

the relative energy spread in an accelerated bunch. Suppose that a mono-energetic e-beam is 

injected in all phases of the wakefield. Following Ref. [7], we assume that the on-axis wake 
potential  is  φ=φmsin(ψ),  where  ψ=kpz−ωpt,  kp  (ωp)  is  the  plasma  wavenumber  (frequency), 

and consider the integral of motion (Hamiltonian) for injected electrons, 

(1) 
where Γ=γ[1−βg(1−γ −2)1/2], γ is the relativistic factor of an electron, βg=vg/c is the normalized

group velocity of the laser pulse. Fig. 2 shows typical behavior of the wakefield components 

near  the  axis,  where,  under  certain  conditions,  part  of  the  injected  bunch  is  trapped.  The 

phase  region  suitable  for  trapping  and  acceleration  of  electrons,  where  the  wakefield  is 
accelerating and focusing, is shown by two dotted vertical lines and is given by ψ− ≤ψ≤π/2. 
In  a  uniform  plasma  ψ−=0,  however  in  a  plasma  channel  the  focusing  region  becomes 

broadened,  so  that  the  minimum  trapping  phase  is  shifted  somewhat  to  the  left  [6,7],  and 
−1/2 is injected at ψ=ψ0. 
ψ−<0. Suppose that an electron with a relativistic factor γ0<γg=(1−βg
2)

The  injected  electron  slips  backwards  relative  to  the  laser  pulse  and  can gain  energy  in  the 

accelerating region. If the wake amplitude is sufficiently high and the electron is injected at a 
proper phase, it can reach γ=γg at the trapping (return) point, and then accelerated to an ultra-
relativistic energy. The trapping phase, ψt, can be found from the Hamiltonian (1):

where  q=[Γ(γ0)−Γ(γg)]/φm.  Taking  into  account  that  ψ−  ≤ψt≤π/2  and  q≥0,  one  has  the 

following trapping condition for the initial phases:

Obviously, when S>1 no electrons can be trapped in the wakefield because the initial energy 

of the injected beam is too low for the chosen wakefield. For a higher injection energy, when 
S=1, only electrons injected at ψ0=π/2 can be trapped, and the trapping point is at ψt=ψ− . The 
minimum relativistic factor for trapping, γmin, can be found from S=1. When γg

which is in a good agreement with numerical simulations. When γ0>γmin (S<1) the region of 
initial  phases  for  trapped  electrons  becomes  π/2−δψ0/2≤ψ0≤π/2+δψ0/2,  where  δψ0  is  the 

width of the region (we assume that the wakefield is focusing within this region). This region 

is  shown  in  Fig.  2  by  the  transparent  rectangular.  The  trapped  electrons  occupy  the  phase 
region  ψ−≤ψt≤ψ−+δψt,  depicted  by  the  black  rectangular  in  Fig.  2.  One  can  show  that 
electrons at the borders of the initial trapping region, with ψ0=π/2±δψ0/2, are trapped at the 
same point, namely at ψt=ψ−, and electrons with ψ0=π/2 are trapped at ψt=ψ−+δψt. The width 
of  the  initial  region  for  trapped  electrons,  δψ0,  is  determined  by  the  equality  sin(ψ0)=S  [7], 
from which one finds δψ0=2arccos(S). The collection efficiency, that is the ratio of number of 
trapped  electrons  to  the  total  number  of  injected  particles,  is  δψ0/2π  [7].  The  width  of  the 
trapping  region,  δψt,  can  be  calculated  taking  into  account  that  ψt=ψ−+δψt  corresponds  to 
ψ0=π/2. In this case, from  Eq. (2), we have δψt=arcsin(1−q)−ψ−. This gives for the trapped 

bunch length:

where  λp  is  the  plasma  wavelength.  In  the  most  interesting  case  of  a  short  trapped  bunch 
2>>(γ0,min)2>>1, 
(δψt<<1)  one  has  δψt≈[Γ(γmin)−Γ(γ0)]/φmcos(ψ−),  and  if  additionally  γg
δψt≈(1/γmin−1/γ0)/2φmcos(ψ−).  For  example,  when  ψ−=−0.75,  λp=47  µm,  γg=59,  φm=0.1  and 
the injection energy is 1.6 MeV (γ0≈4.13), expression (5) predicts the trapped bunch length of 
≈5 µm, that agrees with the simulations (see Fig. 5(b) in [7]). So, when the injection energy is 

close to the minimum trapping energy, the trapped bunch length can be much smaller than the 

plasma  wavelength.  In  this  case  the  trapped  electrons  experience  almost  the  same 

accelerating force that could lead to a small energy spread in the accelerated bunch [7]. The 

higher  the  initial  bunch  energy,  the  larger  the  collection  efficiency  and  the  trapped  bunch 

length, but also the larger the energy spread. Thus, the above estimations predict that a long 

(unphased)  e-bunch  injection  in  the  laser  wakefield  could  lead  to  a  very  short  accelerated 

bunches with a relatively small energy spread. 

To study the effect of interaction of the injected bunch with the laser pulse before the 

plasma  channel,  we  describe  the  axially-symmetrical  Gaussian  laser  pulse  with  the 
normalized  amplitude,  a=EL/(mecωL/e)  [1],  as  a=a0(w0/w)exp[−r2/w2−(ψ−ψc)2/σ2],  where  ψc 

is the center of the pulse. The pulse is focused and matched to a plasma channel and guided 

 

4

in it with a constant radius. In the channel w=w0 and w=w0(1+z2/ZR

2)1/2 before the channel, in 

vacuum, where the ponderomotive force [9] is used to calculate the bunch-laser interaction. 

The  injected  bunch  is  modeled  by  a  random  Gaussian  distribution  in  both  longitudinal  and 
radial  direction,  with  an  average  electron  concentration  nb~exp[−r2/rb
2].  The 

2−(z−vbt)2/σb

channel-guided laser wakefield and electron motion in the wakefield are calculated the same 

way as done in [5].  

To demonstrate the effect of ponderomotive scattering of the injected bunch in front 

of  the channel,  we  first  choose  parameters  for  the  wakefield  and  the  injected  bunch  energy 

used for Fig. 5 of Ref. [7]. Our Fig. 3 shows the injected bunch at the entrance of the plasma 

channel without (a) and with (b) the laser-bunch interaction before the channel. One can see 

strong ponderomotive scattering of most of the injected electrons in Fig. 3(b); the rms spread 

in the transverse momentum in this case is about 0.1 mec. As a result the collection efficiency 

becomes very small: it is 1 % (26 %) with (without) inclusion of the interaction. 

For our simulations we choose the parameters close to those used in [7]: λL=0.8 µm, 
−3), w0=30 µm, σ=15 µm, the spot-

λp=47 µm (plasma electron concentration of ≈5×1017 cm

size-corrected  gamma  factor,  corresponding  to  the  laser  group  velocity  in  the  channel  of 
−1/2≈52.6.  The  e-bunch  is  focused  to  the  channel  to  a  radius  rb=w0  and 
(λp/λL)[1+(λp/πw0)2]
with a convergence angle of 0.42o, so that at 20 cm before the channel the bunch radius is 1.5 

mm.  The  full-width-at-half-maximum  duration  of  the  injected  bunch  is  250  fs  (that 
corresponds to σb=45 µm), the bunch center is at 60 µm distance from the laser pulse center 

when the bunch enters the channel. The plasma channel length is fixed and equal to 5 cm. For 

these parameters of the problem four trapped bunches are formed. The values are calculated 

for all trapped electrons. Fig. 4 compares the collection efficiency, the relative energy spread 

and the mean energy in the accelerated bunch with and without the interaction in front of the 
channel in dependence on the injection energy (in this case φm=0.1). Again we see that when 

one  takes  into  account  the  ponderomotive  scattering,  the  collection  efficiency  drops 

considerably at low injection energies. At higher injection energies the effect of the scattering 

becomes weaker, as mentioned above, however the energy spread in the accelerated bunch in 

this  case  becomes  larger.  In  Fig.  4  some  improvement  in  the  relative  energy  spread  can  be 

seen with the interaction turned on, due to smaller contribution from the off-axis electrons. In 

Fig.  5  we  plot  the  collection  efficiency  and  the  relative  energy  spread  in  the  accelerated 
bunches for the case of lower laser intensity, a0=0.2, for which φm≈0.016 and the minimum 
trapping energy is ≈5.5 MeV (γ0≈12). Simulations showed that in this example the effect of 

 

5

ponderomotive  scattering  is  negligible  because  of  the  lower  pulse  intensity  and  larger 
catching distance (remember that Lc∝γ0
2), so that most of the injected electrons interact with 

the laser pulse at large distance from the focus, where the ponderomotive force is very weak. 

For  the  injection  energies  used  for  Fig.  5,  the  mean  energy  in  the  accelerated  bunch  lies 

between 40 and 49 MeV’s. 

In  summary,  we  studied  an  important  additional  issue  that  may  have  significant 

influence on external e-bunch injection for laser wakefield acceleration. It turns out that, due 

to the laser-bunch interaction in front of the plasma, a high collection efficiency together with 

a small energy spread of the accelerated e-bunch can be obtained only with a combination of 

relatively high injection energy and a weak laser wakefield. The energy gain in this  case is 

typically  in  the  order  of  a  few  tens  of  MeV’s.  Such  an  experiment  is  planned  for  the  near 

future at Eindhoven University of Technology [10].

Abstract 
 

A  class  of  silicon  carbide  cage  clusters  with  two  carbon  atoms  inside  the  silicon  cage  and 
with  high  stabilities  are  presented.  The  theoretical  formalism  used  is  Hartree-Fock  theory 
followed  by  second  order  many  body  perturbation  theory  to  account  for  correlation  effects 
and  geometry  optimizations  at  the  second  order  perturbation  theory  level  are  performed 
without any symmetry constraints. The smallest “cage” is found to be a silicon cube with the 
carbon  dimer  inside  the  cube.  Based  on  the  simultaneous  criteria  of  high  binding  energy, 
high  vertical  ionization  potential,  high  homo-lumo  gap,  and  low  vertical  electron  affinity, 
Si14C2,  with  a  close  fullerene  like  structure,  is  predicted  to  be  a  particularly  stable  cluster 
both at all-electron and at pseudopotential level of calculations. The C-C bond lengths and 
the HOMO-LUMO gaps of the clusters are both found to oscillate with cluster size.

Clusters  are  distinctly  different  from  their  bulk 
state  and  exhibit  many  specific  properties,  which 
distinguishes their studies as a completely different 
branch of science named “Cluster Science”. Large 
surface  to  volume  ratio  and  quantum  effects 
resulting  from  small  dimensions  are  usually 
prominent in clusters and ideas like ‘super-atoms’, 
‘magic  numbers’  or  ‘fission’  in  clusters  [1  −  4] 
have  prompted  a  wide  class  of  scientists  to  study 
this  ‘relatively’  new  area  of  the  physical  sciences. 
Growing interests in the stabilities of small clusters 
and  the  evolution  of  bulk  properties  from  cluster 
properties  are  also  due  to  the  emergence  of  new 
areas  of 
and 
nanotechnology  and  the  resulting  potentials  in 
industrial  applications.  In  the  study  of  clusters, 
cage-like  compact  structures  are  particularly 
important for two reasons; first, they can be used as 
building blocks of more stable materials. Secondly, 
the hollow space inside a cage can be used to dope 
different  suitable  atoms  to  yield  a  wide  variety  of 
atomically  engineered  materials  with  specific 
properties. 
well-controlled 
nanostructures  with  varying  HOMO-LUMO  gaps 
and desired conduction properties can be achieved 
by  controlled  doping  of  atoms  in  C60  clusters  [5]. 
The  spin  property  of  the  doped  atom  inside  the 
cage  can  be  used  as  the  smallest  memory  devices

for  future  quantum  computers;  for 
instance, 
tungsten  in  Si12  clusters  is  quantum  mechanically 
isolated  from  outside  so  it  can  preserve  its  spin 
state [6].  

Silicon is one of the most important semi-
conducting  elements  with  widespread  applications 
in  industry  and  silicon  clusters,  preferring  sp3 
hybridization, have been studied extensively in the 
literature.  Different  theoretical  methods  based  on 
Hartree-Fock  (HF)  and  density  functional  theories 
(DFT)  [7-9]  have  been  used  to  determine  the 
ground  state  structures  of  bare  Si  clusters.  Still 
much  debate  exists  on  the  structures  of  medium 
sized  Si  clusters,  because  a  large  number  of 
topologically different structures are possible as the 
number  of  atoms  in  the  cluster  increases  [10]. 
Discovery  of  the  magically  stable  C60  fullerene 
cage  have  prompted  scientists  to  study  fullerene-
like silicon structures and it was found that the Si60 
has  a  distorted  fullerene-cage-like  structure  [11]. 
Attempt  also  has  been  made  to  replace  carbon 
atoms  by  Si  atoms  in  C60,  resulting  in  a  distorted 
structure  [12].  In  carbon  clusters,  preferring  sp2 
hybridization,  fullerene  like  structures  are  found 
experimentally  in  as  small  as  C20  clusters  [13].  In 
Sin  clusters,  starting  from  n=19,  ground  state 
prolate 
structures 

drastically 

change 

from

assemblies  of  Si9  subunits  to  more  compact  cage 
like geometries [10].  

It has been pointed out recently, primarily 
based  on  DFT  studies,  that  highly  stable  small 
silicon cage clusters are possible if transition metal 
atoms  are  encapsulated  in  the  cage  [14].  The 
combinations  of  silicon  and  carbon  atoms  in  a 
cluster  have  generated  a  number  of  studies.  These 
studies,  ranging  in  areas  from  cluster  science  to 
astrophysics  have  primarily  concentrated  on 
clusters rich in carbon atoms [15]. However, to the 
best  of  our  knowledge,  Si  rich  cage  type  silicon 
carbide  clusters  have  not  been  studied  in  detail  so 
far.  We  show  below  that  carbon  dimers  trapped 
into  medium  size  silicon  clusters  produces 
to  metal 
structures  comparable 
encapsulated  silicon  cage  clusters.  For 
this 
purpose,  we  have  carried  out  ab  initio  Hartree-
second  order  Møller  Plesset

electronic and geometric structures of SinC2 (n = 8-
14)  clusters.  We  have  recently  applied  this  theory 
to  study  silver  clusters  and  predicted  Ag8  to  be  a 
magic  cluster 
[16].  Both  all  electron  and 
pseudopotential basis sets have been used. For the 
all  electron  calculations,  a  6-311G**  [8]  basis  set 
and  for  the  other,  effective  core  potentials  with 
Hay-Wadt  basis  sets  have  been  used 
[17]. 
Geometry  optimizations  have  been  carried  out  at 
the  second  order  perturbation  theory  level  and  all 
computations  have  been  performed  using  the 
Gaussian 98 suite of programs [18]. 

in  stability 

to  study 

In  table  1,  we  have  listed  the  binding 
energy  (BE),  vertical  ionization  potential  (VIP), 
vertical  electron  affinity  (VEA),  highest  occupied 
molecular  orbital  –  lowest  unoccupied  molecular 
orbital  (HOMO-LUMO)  gap,  and  the  C-C  bond 
length  for  all  the  clusters.  Here  the  binding 
energies are calculated at the separated atom limit, 
with  the  atoms  in  their  respective  ground  states. 
Figure  1  shows  the  optimized  cluster  structures 
obtained  at  the  MP2.  For  each  cluster,  we  have 
optimized  several  possible  structures;  only  the 
most  stable  structures  are  shown  here  [19].  The 
smallest  structure  is  a  cube  like  structure  with 
silicon  atoms  at  the  corner  of  the  cube  and  two 
carbon  atoms  inside  the  cube.  The  width  of  the 
cube is 2.58 Å, and the C−Si bond length is 1.93 Å 
with 6-311G** basis set. The height of the cube is 
0.15 Å longer than its width. The binding energy of 
this  cluster  was  found  to  be  37.44eV.  The  C-C 
bond length is 1.43 A, to be compared with the free 
carbon dimer bond length of 1.27 A. Thus, the C-C 
bond length stretches by 0.16 Å in the presence of 
the  silicon  atoms.  From  Mulliken  charge  analysis, 
we  find  that  the  carbon  atoms  are  negatively 

charged with −1.06e ( −1.75e with Hay-Wadt basis 
set),  while  all  the  Si  atoms  are  slightly  positively 
charged.  The  bonding  is  thus  partially  ionic.  As 
regards stability is concerned, the cluster also has a 
high  VIP  of  7.72eV,  high  HOMO-LUMO  gap  of 
6.64eV and a rather low VEA of 1.19eV. We note 
here that in metal doped fullerenes, metal atom act 
as  an  electron  donor,  whereas  in  the  present  case 
doped  carbon  atoms  acquired  negative  charges. 
the  electronic  and  geometric  structure 
Also, 
quantities  are,  to  an  extent,  method  and  basis-set 
dependent. For example, for Si8 C2, we carried out 
optimizations  with  two  other  basis  sets,  namely 
STO-3G  and  3-21G.  The  homo-lumo  gap  was 
6.590eV for the minimal basis set and 6.004eV for 
the 3-21G set. The primary  conclusions about this 
unique set of clusters are however expected to hold 
true,  irrespective  of  the  methodology  used.  Si9C2 
cluster  is  a  cage  made  up  with  a  rectangle  and  a 
pentagon of Si atoms, with C2 inside the cage. The 
starting 
before 
optimization was a capped cubic structure, i.e., a Si 
cap was added to the optimized Si8C2 cluster. The 
binding  energy  for  this  cluster  is  42.46eV,  with  a 
HOMO-LUMO  gap  of  5.89eV.  The  vertical 
ionization  potential  is  7.88eV  and  the  VEA  is 
1.34eV. The height of the cage is 2.56 Å and C-C 
bond  length  is  1.48  Å.  This  cluster  is  not  as 
symmetrical  as  the  previous  one,  Si8C2;  as  a 
consequence,  it  has  a  small  dipole  moment  and 
nonzero 
quadrupole  moments. 
Similar  to  the  Si8C2  cluster,  the  carbon  atoms  are 
negatively  charged.  The  average  Si-C bond  length 
is almost the same as in the cubic cluster.

Si10C2 cluster, after optimization, assumes 
the structure of two pentagons of Si atoms back to 
back  with  the  two  carbon  atoms  parallel  to  the 
pentagonal face. The C-C bond length of 1.52A is 
slightly  greater  than  the  previous  cluster.  The 
average  C-Si  bond  length  is  1.985  Å,  which  is 
higher  than  the  previous  two  clusters.  From  the 
structural  point  of  view,  this  cluster  is  more 
compact  than  the  Si9C2  clusters.  The  vertical 
ionization  potential  is  8.47eV  and  the  vertical 
electron  affinity  is  1.81eV,  with  a  HOMO-LUMO 
gap  of  4.97eV.  For  Si11C2,  the  structure  is  not 
exactly  a  cage  type  structure.  It  is  a  tricapped 
twisted  cubic  Si-frame  with  the  two  carbon  atoms 
at the middle joining the two faces; Si atoms in the 
two  twisted  opposite  capped  surfaces  are  too 
separated to make it a closed structure. One of the 
silicon  atoms  forms  a  bridge  between  these  two 
separated capped faces on one side of the stretched 
cube. The C-C bond length is 1.46 Ǻ, and the Si-C 
average bond length is almost the same as the first 
two  structures.  Binding  energy  of  this  cluster  is

49.01eV,  with  a  HOMO-LUMO  gap  of  6.69eV. 
Vertical  ionization  potential  for  this  cluster  is 
7.40eV. In spite of the fact that this cluster is more 
prolate-type, 
the  Mulliken  charge  distribution 
shows the same pattern as the smaller clusters.

studied 
extensively 
the 
formation of magic clusters with metal atoms, such 
as W or Cr, inside. However, magicity is not well 
defined for the clusters whose constituents are non-
metallic  atoms,  as  pointed  out  by  Khanna  et  al. 
[14]. This is mainly because there is no jellium like 
model for covalently bonded non-metallic clusters, 
so  the  shell  closing  at  2,  8,  20,  …  of  valence 
electrons  is  not  theoretically  justified  here.  For 
Si12C2,  with  Hay-Wadt  basis  set,  two  competing 
cage clusters are the four Si capped cubic cage and 
distorted  hexagonal  cage,  with  the  distorted  cage 
being  slightly  lower  in  energy.  For  the  cubic  cage 
the  two  carbon  atoms  are  completely  within  the 
cage  with  a  C-C  bond  length  of  1.54  Å.  For  the 
distorted hexagonal cage, the two carbon atoms are 
also  inside  the  cage  but  parallel  to  the  base  of  the 
cluster.  The  overall  charge  distribution  pattern  is 
the same as the other smaller clusters. One point is 
to  note  that  between  these  two  structures,  in  the 
hexagonal cage the carbon atoms are less negative. 
Optimization  with  the  all  electron  basis  set  also 
found  the  distorted  hexagonal  cage  as  the  ground 
state.  Vertical  ionization  potential  is  7.70eV  for 
this cage and VEA is 2.91eV. The C-C bond length 
in  this  case  is  1.54  Å.  Binding  energy  for  this

Si13C2  and  Si14C2  are  formed  by  putting 
 
Si-cap  on  the  hexagonal  cage  of  Si12C2.  The 
hexagonal cage is distorted, but in both of the two 
cases  two  carbon  atoms  are  inside  the  cage.  The 
Si14C2  cluster  looks  like  a  distorted  sphere  made 
with  12  irregular  rectangles,  where  carbon  atoms 
are  not  exactly  in  the  center  of  the  sphere.  The 
binding energies for these two clusters are 57.04eV 
and 62.24eV, respectively. HOMO-LUMO gap for 
the  bigger  cluster  is  about  1.3eV  higher.  The 
vertical  ionization  potential  for  the  Si14C2  is 
8.58eV,  which  is  very  high.  However  the  main 
difference  between  these  two  clusters  and  the 
previous  set  is  in  the  charge  distribution.  Along 
with  the  two  negatively  charged  carbon  atoms, 
some other Si atoms also became slightly negative. 
C-C  bond  lengths  for  13  and  14  atom  Si  clusters 
are 1.45 Å and 1.52 Å respectively.

In  figures  2  and  3,  we  have  plotted  the 
 
binding  energies  per  atom,  vertical  ionization 
potentials,  vertical  electron  affinities,  homo-lumo 
gaps, and the carbon dimer bond lengths versus the 
number  of  silicon  atoms  in  the  cluster,  with  both 
the  all  electron  and  the  pseudopotential  basis  sets. 
At  the  all  electron  basis  set  level,  Si14C2  has  the 
highest  binding  energy  but  at  the  pseudopotential 
level,  Si9  C2  has  the  highest  binding  energy.  The 
general  pattern  is  similar,  with  the  all  electron 
binding energies being consistently higher than the 
pseudopotential binding energies. We also note that 
all  the  VIPs  are  rather  high  and  all  the  VEAs  are 
rather  low.  In  addition,  for  all  the  clusters,  the 
HOMO-LUMO  gaps  are  also  very  high. Thus,  we 
can infer that the reactivity for this class of clusters 
is not very high. In the plot for VIP, after an initial 
peak  at  Si9C2,  it  decreases  and  then  increases  for 
the highest peak at Si14C2 with the Hay-Wadt basis 
set,  whereas  with  the  6-311G**  basis  set,  initial 
peak  is  at  Si10C2  followed  by  the  highest  pack  at 
Si13C2. However, Si14C2 has also considerably high 
VIP.  It  also  has  the  lowest  VEA  of  0.05eV  at  the 
all-electron  basis  set  and  0.08eV  at  the  Hay-Wadt 
basis set level. The very high IP and lowest EA of 
Si14C2 indicate that this cluster may be a candidate 
for a highly stable cluster. Only for this cluster, we 
have a distorted spherical shape, implying that the 
competition  between  sp2  and  sp3  hybridizations  is 
rather balanced here. Average coordination number 
per  atom  of  this  cluster  is  3.87.  We  also  note  that

neighboring  clusters.  In  the  plot  showing  the 
variations  of  the  HOMO-LUMO  gap  with  the 
cluster  size,  both  plots  with  the  two  basis  sets 
indicate  a  peak  at  Si11C2.  This  cluster  also  has 
considerably high IP but its electron affinity is also 
high  compared  to  most  of  the  other  clusters.  This 
cluster  is  not  exactly  a  cage-type,  but  more  open 
type. 
 
As  a  general  feature,  we  also  note,  as 
mentioned  before,  carbon  atoms  gain  charge 
whereas  silicon  atoms  lose  charge.  This  is  also  to 
be  expected  from  electronegativity  considerations. 
In  the  plot  for  the  C-C  bond  length  versus  the 
number  of  Si  atoms  in  a  cluster,  an  oscillatory 
pattern 
is 
observed  between  the  C-C  bond  length  and  the 
HOMO-LUMO gap. At the level of both basis sets, 
the local minima for the C-C bond length for Si11C2 
corresponds  to  a  local  maxima  for  the  HOMO-
LUMO gap. Up to Si13C2, the curves of C-C bond 
lengths are similar. Stronger overlapping of the C-
C orbitals contributes to the stability of the clusters, 
and  C-C  bond  length  directly  influences  the 
HOMO-LUMO gap. We note here, as was pointed

final  comment,  as  these  are  Si  rich  clusters,  sp3 
hybridization  dominates,  and 
this  may  be 
responsible  for  the  distortion  seen  in  the  clusters 
from  the  symmetry.  However  the  reasons  behind 
the  oscillatory  behaviors  in  HOMO-LUMO  gap 
and C-C bonding needs more study. 
 
In  summary,  we  studied  here  a  class  of 
silicon  carbide  cage  cluster  with  higher  stability 
where  the  two  carbon  atoms  sit  within  the  silicon 
cage. Second order many body perturbation theory 
was  used 
the  electron 
correlations  and  full  geometry  optimization  was 
done  without  any  symmetry  constraint.  The 
smallest  cage  was  found  to  be  a  silicon  cube  with 
carbon dimer inside the cube. It was found that the 
Si14C2 is almost a spherical structure with very high 
VIP,  lowest  VEA  and  higher  HOMO-LUMO  gap. 
In all the clusters studied here, doped carbon atoms 
become negatively charged, unlike any other metal 
doped  fullerenes.  It  was  also  found  that  the  C-C 
bond  length  has  direct  influence  on  the  HOMO-
LUMO gap of the clusters. They both oscillate with 
respect to cluster size.

the 

out  by  Grev  and  Schaefer  [20],  that  the  Si-C  π-
bond  energy  is  70%  of  the  analogous  C-C  π-bond 
energy, whereas for σ-bond both the C-C and Si-C 
bonds  are  of  the  same  strength.  Typically,  silicon 
atoms  prefer  σ  bonding  and  carbon  atoms,  π 
bonding.  As  the  C-C  distance  increases,  the 
likelihood  of  π  bonding  between  them  decreases. 
Usually  higher  C-C  bond  length  means  higher 
height  of  the  cage;  this,  in  turn,  implies  weaker 
overlapping  of  Si  atoms  situated  in  the  upper  and 
lower  surfaces  of  the  cage,  so  the  σ  bonding 
became  weaker  between  these  atoms.  There  are 
some  Si  atoms  in  the  cage  which  are  threefold 
coordinated, e.g., in Si13C2 there are six three fold 
coordinated  atoms.  This  implies  two  possibilities: 
firstly  in  the  case  of  sp3  bonding  between  the 
atoms, there should be a dangling bond associated 
with  the  three-fold  coordinated  atoms.  Second 
possibility  is  that  if  the  bonding  is  sp2  then  either 
there  would  be  some  double  bonding  between  the 
silicon  in  the  cage,  or  there  would  be  again 
dangling bonds. The effect of the dangling bonds is 
to  destabilize  the  clusters.  Though  the  structures 
are  distorted  from  their  perfectly  symmetrical 
situation,  the  structures  did  stabilize.  So  the 
is  a  mixture  of  sp2  and  sp3 
bonding  here 
hybridization to minimize the dangling bond effect, 
which  is  well  known  in  case  for  fullerenes.  As  a

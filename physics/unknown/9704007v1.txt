Abstract

It is shown that the new family of geometric models of the rela-
tivistic oscillator [1], which generalize the anti-de Sitter model, leads
to relativistic P¨oschl-Teller or Rosen-Morse problems.

One of the simplest (1+1) geometric models is that of the (classical or
quantum) relativistic harmonic oscillator (RHO). Based on phenomenolog-
ical [2] and group theoretical [3, 4] arguments, this has been deﬁned as a
free system on the anti-de Sitter static background. There exists a (3+1)
anti-de Sitter static metric [2] which reproduces the classical equations of
motion of the non-relativistic izotropic harmonic oscillator. This metric can
be restricted to a (1+1) metric which gives the classical equation of the
one-dimensional non-relativistic harmonic oscillator (NRHO). Moreover, the
corresponding quantum model has an equidistant discrete energy spectrum
with a ground state energy larger, but approaching ω/2 in the non-relativistic
limit (in natural units ¯h = c = 1) [5].

In a previous article [1] we have generalized this model to the family of
(1+1) models depending on a real parameter λ which has the metrics given
by

ds2 = g00dt2 + g11dx2 =

1 + (1 + λ)ω2x2
1 + λω2x2

dt2

−

1 + (1 + λ)ω2x2
(1 + λω2x2)2 dx2,

(1)

where ω is the frequency. This parametrization has been deﬁned in order to
obtain the exact anti-de Sitter metric for λ =
1. Therein we have studied
the scalar ﬁeld φ of the mass m, deﬁned on a suitable space domain, D, and
minimally coupled with the gravitational ﬁeld [6] given by (1). Since the
energy is conserved, the Klein-Gordon equation, (✷ + m2)φ = 0, admits the
set of fundamental solutions (of positive and negative frequency)

which must be orthogonal with respect to the relativistic scalar product [6].
This reduces to the following scalar product of the wave functions U

By solving the Klein-Gordon equations we have shown that the models with
λ > 0 have mixed energy spectra, with a ﬁnite discrete sequence and a
continuous part, while for λ
0 these spectra are countable [1]. However,
despite of their diﬀerent relativistic behavior, all these models have the same
non-relativistic limit, namely the NRHO of the frequency ω. For this reason
we shall use the name of relativistic oscillators (RO) for all the models with
λ
1, understanding that the RHO is only that of the anti-de Sitter metric.

In general, any (1+1) static background admits a special natural frame in
which the metric is a conformal transformation of the Minkowski ﬂat metric.
This new frame can be obtained by changing the space coordinate

and, therefore, the scalar product (3) becomes the usual one.

Our aim is to show that, in this frame, the Klein-Gordon equation of our
RO will involve relativistic symmetric P¨oschl-Teller (PT) potentials for λ < 0
and symmetric Rosen-Morse (RM) potentials for λ > 0 [7]. When λ = 0 the
relativistic potential will be proportional with that of the NRHO.

functions must be square integrable with respect to the usual scalar product
in the coordinate ˆx. These have the form

The quantum numbers ns = 0, 1, 2... and s = 0, 1 can be embedded into the
main quantum number n = 2ns + s, which take even values if s = 0 and odd
values for s = 1. The energy levels are given by

En = ˆω(k + n)

in the tha case of the RHO [5], when ǫ = 1. According to (13), the second
term of the left-hand side of (20) can be written as

VP T (ˆx) = k(k

1)ˆω2 tan2 ˆωˆx.

This will be called the relativistic (symmetric) PT potential since the so-
lutions (11) coincide with those given by the Schr¨odinger equation with the
non-relativistic PT potential VP T /2m. Hence, for ǫ > 0 our RO are systems of
relativistic massive scalar particles conﬁned to wells, as in the non-relativistic
case, but having new energy spectra and another parametrization which de-
pends on m, ω and ǫ. We note that our new parameter ǫ allows to choose the
desired well width, π/ǫω, when the frequency ω is ﬁxed. Therefore, this will
be a supplementary ﬁt parameter in the problems of geometric conﬁnement.

For λ > 0 we change the signiﬁcance of ǫ and we put

λ = ǫ2,

ˆω = ǫω,

As in the previous case, we shall say that

is the relativistic (symmetric) RM potential. The solutions (21) and (25) are
the same as those given by the non-relativistic RM potential VRM /2m. Of
course, the relativistic energy spectra diﬀer from the non-relativistic ones.
We note that the number of the discrete energy levels is determined by the
values of m/ω (i.e. mc2/¯hω in usual units) and ǫ deﬁned according to (17).
Moreover, for a ﬁxed m, the domains of the discrete and continuous spectra
are given by ǫ only.

We have shown [1] that our family of RO is continuous in λ = 0. This
0 of the PT and RM systems must coincide.

Obviously, the NRHO potential is V /2m.

λ

The conclusion is that our family of metrics (1), which depend on the
parameter λ, generates relativistic PT or RM problems, in the special frames
(t, ˆx). The PT and RM potentials have similar forms being proportional
with m2/
. On the other hand, it is interesting that this parameter (or
the parameter ǫ related to it) has not a direct non-relativistic equivalent
since, in this limit, all the RO become NRHO and, consequently, the terms
involving λ disappear [1]. However, its physical signiﬁcance results from the
analysis of the relativistic eﬀects, as we have seen from the previous discussion
concerning the behavior of the relativistic PT or RM systems.

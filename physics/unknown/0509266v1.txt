ABSTRACT 

We  demonstrate  a  real-time  transient  waveform  digitizer  with  a  record  1  TSa/s  (Tera-

Sample/sec)  sampling  rate.  This  is  accomplished  by  using  a  photonic  time  stretch 

preprocessor  which  slows  down  the  electrical  waveform  before  it  is  captured  by  an 

electronic digitizer.

Tera-sample-per-second Real-time Waveform Digitizer 

Digital  processing  and  storage  of  information  is  a  ubiquitous  function  encountered  in 

virtually  every  science  and  engineering  discipline.  Since  signals  originating  in  the 

physical  world  are  analog,  Analog-to-Digital  Converters  (ADC),  otherwise  known  as 

digitizers,  play  a  central  role.  The  most  challenging  signals  to  digitize  are  ultrafast 

transients  that  are  non-repetitive.    These  waveforms  arise  in  a  number  of  applications 

including  (i)  diagnostic  tool  in  particle  accelerators  that  probe  fundamental  building 

blocks  of  nature;  (ii)  X-ray  free  electron  lasers1;  (iii)  study  of  EMP  (electromagnetic 

pulse)  weapons 2 .  Digitizers  with  real-time  capability  are  required  because  the  non-

repetitive nature of these signals renders traditional sampling oscilloscopes useless. 

The  sampling  rate  of  conventional  electronic  ADCs,  such  as  ones  used  in  high  speed 

instruments, is limited by the speed of the electronic circuitry, and in the case where the 

interleaving  architecture  is  used,  by  the  mismatches  in  the  multi-channel  ADC  array3,4. 

While the performance of electronic ADCs continues to improve, the sampling rate of a 

state-of-the-art system is currently about 20 GSa/s with ~5 ENOB (Effective Number Of 

Bits).  Achieving  TSa/s  performance  is  clearly  beyond  the  reach  of  conventional 

approaches.  One  potential  solution  to  overcome  the  electronic  bottleneck  is  to  use 

photonic pre-processing. In particular, the photonic time stretch approach has proven to 

be an effective way to extend the sampling rate and the bandwidth. Here, the high speed 

transient waveform is first slowed down and then captured by a conventional electronic 

digitizer5,6. In this paper, we demonstrate such a system that achieves a sampling rate of 1 

TSa/s. This system consists of a 50x time stretch pre-processor and a 20 GSa/s electronic

digitizer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the real-time digitization 

at 1 TSa/s has been achieved. 

The  time  stretch  preprocessing,  shown  in  Fig.  1,  consists  of  three  steps:  time-to-

wavelength  transformation,  wavelength  domain  processing,  and  wavelength-to-time 

transformation.  Time-to-wavelength  transformation  occurs  when  the  electrical  signal 

modulates the intensity of a linearly-chirped optical pulse. At the output of modulator, the 

input signal’s time scale is linearly mapped onto the optical wavelength. The second and 

third  steps  occur  simultaneously  when  the  waveform  is  broadened  as  it  travels  through 

the second dispersive optical medium and is subsequently photodetected. 

The  major  obstacle  to  achieving  a  stretch  factor  of  50x  is  to  overcome  the  frequency 

fading  that  is  associated  with  dispersive  propagation.  This  phenomenon  has  been 

described  in  details  elsewhere5,6.  Briefly,  it  occurs  due  to  the  dispersion-induced 

interference between the two modulation-sidebands. We overcome this problem using the 

recently  proposed  phase  diversity  technique,  where  two  stretched  waveforms  with 

complementary  fading  characteristics  are  realized  and  combined  to  eliminate  the 

bandwidth  limitation7.  Another  practical  concern  is  the  large  loss  of  dispersive  fiber 

required to achieve such a large stretch factor. This problem is mitigated by the judicious 

use  of  optical  amplification  in  such  a  manner  as  to  optimize  the  overall  signal  to  noise 

ratio while avoiding degradation from optical nonlinearity.

The block diagram of experimental setup for a 50x photonic time stretch preprocessor is 

shown  in  Fig.  2.  Ultrashort  and  broadband  optical  pulses  are  produced,  with  repetition 

period T=200ns, through the continuum generation process. Around 15 nm of the optical 

spectrum at (centered at 1590 nm) is sliced using an optical bandpass filter and is used in 

the experiment. After being linearly chirped by propagation in a spool of dispersive fiber, 

a given pulse enters the electro-optic modulator where it captures the electrical transient. 

The  chirped  optical  pulse  has  finite  amplitude  variations  resulting  in  distortion  of  the 

captured  signal.  The  distortion  is  removed  by  using  a  reference  waveform  and  digital 

filtering6. The modulator has two outputs with complimentary fading characteristics, and 

after delaying one by T/2, the outputs are interleaved and stretched together in the second 

dispersive  fiber.  The  first  fiber  has  a  total  dispersion  of  D1  =  -101  ps/nm,  creating  a 

chirped optical pulse with around 1.5 ns duration. The second fiber has a total dispersion 

of D2 = -4921 ps/nm. The stretch factor is give by (D1+D2)/D1 = 505,6. To minimize the 

noise  contributed  by  the  optical  amplifiers,  the  waveform  is  filtered  by  an  optical 

bandpass  filter  before  photodetection.  The  detected  waveform  is  subsequently  captured 

by  a  Tektronix  TDS7404  (4GHz  analog  bandwidth,  20GSa/s)  real-time  digitizer.  The 

effective sampling rate of this system is 20 GSa/s x 50 = 1 TSa/s and the intrinsic input 

analog bandwidth is 4 GHz x 50 = 200 GHz, although, in the experiments reported here, 

the electro-optic modulator places a limit of around 50 GHz. 

 

 

Figure 3 shows the real-time capture of a 48 GHz tone at 1 TSa/s. The measured voltage 

Full  Width  Half  Maximum  (FWHM)  time  aperture  is  1.1  ns.  The  time  aperture 

determines  the  length  of  transients  that  can  be  captured.  The  measured  stretch  factor  is 

4

50.5. To obtain the average SNR, 200 such real-time measurements are preformed. Over 

a  10  GHz  digitally  filtered  bandwidth  centered  at  48  GHz,  the  mean  and  standard 

deviation  of  SNR  in  each  of  200  measurements  is  22.7 ± 1.08  dB  corresponding  to 

3.5 ± 0.2  ENOB.  Measurements  at  other  input  frequencies  with  the  same  bandwidth 

resulted in up to 4.2 ENOB. 

 

 

 

The  digitizer  performance  is  also  measured  in  the  frequency  domain.  Fig.  4  shows  the 

digital  spectrum  of  a  measured  26  GHz  signal  and  a  42  GHz  signal,  respectively.  The 

Hanning  window  was  used  before  discrete  Fourier  transform.  We  note  that  no  digital 

filter  was  used  to  obtain  the  data  in  Fig.  4,  hence  the  input  analog  bandwidth  of  these 

spectrums is 0 – 200 GHz. The 2nd harmonic distortion tone is observed in Fig. 4. These 

arise due to nonlinear electrooptic modulation that is affected by memory effects in the 

fiber,  a  phenomenon  that  has  been  previously  predicted  by  theory6.  Post-nonlinear-

compensation  performed  in  the  digital  domain  similar  to  broadband  power  amplifier 

linearization in wireless communications can potentially mitigate this type of distortion. 

The highest spurious peak appearing at 125 GHz is due to the electronic digitizer and is 

independent of the time stretch processor. 

Although  the  TSa/s  digitizer  has  an  intrinsic  bandwidth  of  200  GHz,  the  experimental 

input  bandwidth  is  limited  by  the  bandwidth  of  the  electro-optic  modulator  to 

approximately 50 GHz. One method to effectively increase the modulation bandwidth is 

to  use  harmonic  modulation.  Conventionally,  the  MZ  modulator  is  biased  at  the 

quadrature point, at which even harmonics are suppressed. If a MZ modulator is biased at 

5

the peak or null of transmission, fundamental frequency and odd harmonics, instead, are 

suppressed. The lowest frequency component is the second harmonic. Hence, an 80 GHz 

sinusoid  modulated  optical  pulse  can  be  generated  from  a  40  GHz  input.  The  digital 

magnitude spectrum of captured 80 GHz signal is shown in Fig. 5. The clean spectral line 

at 80 GHz demonstrates the potential of time stretch processor beyond 50 GHz if an MZ 

modulator with a larger bandwidth is used in the setup. The spurious tones at 40 and 120 

GHz are from the under-suppressed fundamental frequency and the 3rd harmonic. 

Optical  nonlinearity  may  distort  the  stretched  signal.  It  is  especially  important  in  TSa/s 

experiment, in which multiple optical amplifications are needed to compensate fiber loss. 

Improper  amplifier  design  may  significantly  distort  signal.  An  example  of  distortion 

pattern  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.  The  distortion  (amplitude  reduction)  is  most  severe  at  the 

center of pulse, where the pulse has highest peak power. This measured distortion pattern 

is  verified  by  the  numerical  simulation  and  is  the  result  of  interaction  between  fiber 

dispersion  and  optical  nonlinearity.  When  the  optical  pulse  is  modulated  by  a  sinusoid 

signal, optical nonlinearity introduces an intensity dependent phase shift in propagation. 

Dispersion causes phase-to-amplitude conversion and hence results in distortion of signal 

amplitude6. Because optical power is highest at the center of time window, the extent of 

nonlinear  distortion varies across the time window and introduces the distortion pattern 

observed in Fig. 6.  

In  summary,  the  photonic  time  stretch  technique  has  been  used  to  realize  a  real-time 

transient digitizer with the record one TSa/s sampling rate. The system has a FWHM time

aperture of 1.1 ns. Measured over a 10 GHz bandwidth, the ENOB of the system ranges 

from 3.5-4.2 bits depending on the input signal frequency.

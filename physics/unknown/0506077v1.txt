Abstract 
Evidence is emerging for physical links among clouds, global temperatures, the global 
atmospheric  electrical  circuit  and  cosmic  ray  ionisation.  The  global  circuit  extends 
throughout  the  atmosphere  from  the  planetary  surface  to  the  lower  layers  of  the 
ionosphere.  Cosmic  rays  are  the  principal  source  of  atmospheric  ions  away  from  the 
continental boundary layer: the ions formed permit a vertical conduction current to flow 
in the fair weather part of the global circuit. Through the (inverse) solar modulation of 
cosmic rays, the resulting columnar ionisation changes may allow the global circuit to 
convey  a  solar  influence  to  meteorological  phenomena  of  the  lower  atmosphere. 
Electrical effects on non-thunderstorm clouds have been proposed to occur via the ion-
assisted  formation  of  ultrafine  aerosol,  which  can  grow  to  sizes  able  to  act  as  cloud 
condensation  nuclei,  or  through  the  increased  ice  nucleation  capability  of  charged 
aerosols. Even small atmospheric electrical modulations on the aerosol size distribution 
can affect cloud properties and modify the radiative balance of the atmosphere, through 
changes  communicated  globally  by  the  atmospheric  electrical  circuit.  Despite  a  long 
history  of  work  in  related  areas  of  geophysics,  the  direct  and  inverse  relationships 
between the global circuit and global climate remain largely quantitatively unexplored. 
From  reviewing  atmospheric  electrical  measurements  made  over  two  centuries  and 
possible paleoclimate proxies, global atmospheric electrical circuit variability should be 
expected on many timescales.

Summary 
The  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  is  modulated  by  variations  in  shower  clouds  and 
tropical  thunderstorms,  and  generates  a  vertical  electric  field  in  non-thunderstorm  (or 
fair  weather)  regions  globally.  Modulation  of  the  fair  weather  electric  field  occurs  on 
daily,  seasonal,  solar  cycle  and  century  timescales.  There  is  a  long  history  of 
atmospheric electric field measurements. 
 
Variations  in  the  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  have  a  new  relevance  because  of 
empirical relationships found between cosmic ray ion production, cloud properties and 
global  temperature.  Mechanisms  have  been  proposed  linking  clouds  and  the  solar 
modulation  of  cosmic  rays  through  the  microphysics  of  ions,  aerosols  and  clouds. 
Theories  exist  which  explain  ion-assisted  aerosol  particle  formation  and  the  increased 
capture  rates  of  charged  aerosols  over  neutral  aerosols  by  cloud  droplets,  possibly 
enhancing droplet freezing. Atmospheric electrical modification of cloud properties may 
have significant global implications for climate, via changes in the atmospheric energy 
balance. 
 
Combining studies of cloud microphysics and cosmic rays with the global atmospheric 
electrical  circuit  presents  a  relatively  unexplored  area  of  climate  science,  in  which 
progress can clearly be expected. Events such as the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests 
offer,  with  suitable  theory  and  cloud  modelling,  the  possibility  to  quantify  changes  in 
radiative  properties  of  the  atmosphere  associated  with  atmospheric  electrical  changes. 
The  long-term  condition  of  the  atmospheric  electrical  system  may  be  inferred  from  a 
combination  of  historical  measurements  and  proxies,  and  compared  with  known 
variations in global temperature.

Introduction 

1.1  Scope and motivation 
 
Atmospheric  electricity  is  one  of  the  longest-investigated  geophysical  topics,  with  a 
variety  of  measurement  technologies  emerging  in  the  late  eighteenth  century  and 
reliable  data  available  from  the  nineteenth  century.  Of  modern  relevance,  however,  is 
the relationship of atmospheric electricity to the climate system (Bering, 1995), through 
climate-induced  changes  to  thunderstorms  (Williams  1992,  1994)  and  the  electrical 
modification  of  non-thunderstorm  clouds.  Although  it  is  well-established  that  clouds 
and  aerosol  modify  the  local  atmospheric  electrical  parameters  (Sagalyn  and  Faucher, 
1954), aerosol microphysics simulations (Yu and Turco, 2001) and analyses of satellite-
derived  cloud  data (Marsh and Svensmark,  2000)  now suggest  that aerosol  formation, 
coagulation and in-cloud aerosol removal could themselves be influenced by changes in 
the electrical properties of the atmosphere (Harrison and Carslaw, 2003). Simulations of 
the  twentieth  century  climate  underestimate  the  observed  climate  response  to  solar 
forcing  (Stott  et  al.,  2003),  for  which  one  possible  explanation  is  a  solar-modulated 
change  in  the  atmospheric  electrical  potential  gradient  (PG)  affecting  clouds  and 
therefore  the  radiative  balance.  As  with  many  atmospheric  relationships,  establishing 
cause and effect from observations is complicated by the substantial natural variability 
present.  The  importance  of  assessing  the  role  of  solar  variability  in  climate  makes  it 
timely  to  review  what  is  known  about  the  possible  relevance  of  the  atmospheric 
electrical circuit of the planet to its climate. The scope of this paper therefore includes 
the  physical  mechanisms  by  which  global  atmospheric  electricity  may  influence 
aerosols  or  clouds,  and  ultimately  climate.  This  is  not  a  review  of  thunderstorm 
electrification,  but  a  discussion  of  possible  influences  on  the  global  atmospheric 
electrical  circuit,  and  the  atmospheric  and  climate  processes  it  may  influence  in  turn. 
The  considerable  sensitivity  of  the  planet’s  albedo  to  cloud  droplet  concentrations 
(Twomey,  1974),  presents  a  strong  motivation  for  investigating  possible  electrical 
effects on cloud microphysics. 
 
Several, traditionally distinct, geophysical topics have to be considered together in order 
to  make  progress  in  the  interdisciplinary  subject  area  of  solar-terrestrial  physics, 
atmospheric  electricity  and  climate.  First,  the  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  has  to  be 
understood,  as  it  communicates  electrical  changes  globally  throughout  the  weather-
forming  regions  of  the  troposphere.  Secondly,  changes  in  thunderstorms  and  shower 
clouds  caused  by  surface  temperature  changes  are  likely  to  provide  an  important 
modulation  on  the  global  atmospheric  electrical  circuit.  Thirdly,  the  microphysics  of 
clouds, particularly ice nucleation and water droplet formation on aerosol particles has 
to  be  assessed  in  terms  of  which  mechanisms,  in  a  myriad  of  other  competing  and 
complicated  cloud  processes,  are  the  most  likely  to  be  significantly  affected  by 
electrical changes in the atmosphere. Changes in the global properties of clouds, even to 
a  small  extent,  have  implications  for  the  long-term  energy  balance  of  the  climate 
system:  electrically-induced  cloud  changes  present  a  new  aspect  (Kirkby,  2001).  
Fourthly, galactic cosmic rays, which are modulated by solar activity, provide a major 
source  of  temporal  and  spatial  variation  in  the  atmosphere’s  electrical  properties.  The 

4

GEOP220 

cosmic  ray  changes  include  sudden  reductions  and  perturbations  on  the  timescales  of 
hours (Forbush decreases and solar proton events) as well as variability  on solar cycle 
(~decadal) time scales and longer. The integration of these four disparate subject areas 
is  a  major  geophysical  challenge,  but,  as  this  paper  shows,  the  elements  exist  for  an 
integrated  quantitative  understanding  of  the  possible  connections  between  solar 
changes, cosmic ray ionisation, the global atmospheric electrical circuit and climate. 
 
Figure 1 summarises the geophysical processes considered in this paper, which has been 
drawn  to  illustrate  the  links  between  the  global  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  and  the 
climate  system.  In  developing  these  ideas,  Section  2  summarises  the  global  electrical 
system  and  Section  3  discusses  the  influences  of  cosmic  rays  on  the  atmosphere, 
knowledge of which may permit extending analysis of the atmospheric electrical system 
back  in  geological  time.  Fossil  evidence  of  ancient  atmospheric  electrical  activity  on 
Earth  (Harland  and  Hacker,  1966)  indicates  that  electrification  is  not  just  a  recent 
property  of  the  terrestrial  atmosphere:  the  possibility  of  solar  modulation  of  climate 
through the global circuit therefore exists into the distant past. 
 
In  the  remainder  of  Section  1,  special  attention  is  given  to  the  pioneering  early 
measurements  made  in  the  subject.  Although  different  land  stations  rarely  show 
correlations  with  each  other  on  an  hourly  basis  (Bhartendu,  1971),  they  form  the 
majority of atmospheric electrical measurements available, motivating the development 
of new data processing methods (Harrison, 2004a, 2004b). Section 2 considers aspects 
of the global atmospheric electrical circuit, and its modulation on different timescales. 
Section  3  summarises  the  physics  of  the  links  between  the  global  circuit  and  climate, 
and Section 4 suggest methods by which they can be investigated further. 
 

1.2  Historical overview of Fair Weather atmospheric electricity 
Observations  of  a  sustained,  but  unexplained  electrification  in  the  fair  weather 
atmosphere probably provided the motivation for the early research. Subsequently, the 
sensitivity  of  electrical  atmospheric  parameters  to  meteorological  changes  was  also 
investigated.  In  pursuing  this,  electrical  measurements  combined  with  meteorological 
observations  were  expected  to  offer  additional  insights  into  the  physical  processes 
causing  the  meteorological  changes.  Consequently  quantitative  studies  of  atmospheric 
electrification  exist  from  the  eighteenth  century  onwards:  many  are  reviewed  by 
Chauveau (1925). 
 

1.2.1  Eighteenth century 
Formal study of atmospheric electricity can usefully be regarded to have begun in 1750, 
with  the  pioneering  thunderstorm  experiments  of  Franklin  in  Philadelphia  and 
D’Alibard in Paris (Fleming, 1939). Thunderstorm and lightning research still remain a 
central aspect of atmospheric electricity, but it is the awareness of electrification present 
in  non-thunderstorm  conditions,  arising  from  the  thunderstorm  research,  which  is 
important  in  this  paper.  Lemonnier  detected  such  electrification  in  clear  air  in  1752 
(Chalmers,  1967)  and  Canton  measured  electrical  changes  arising  from  non-lightning 
producing  clouds  (Herbert,  1997).  Other  pioneering  eighteenth  century  studies  also 
retain  some  relevance:  Beccaria  (1775)  measured  daily  variations  in  atmospheric 

 

5

GEOP220 

electricity  for  a  period  of  several  years,  including  the  existence  of  positive 
electrification  on  fine  days,  and  noted  the  effect  of  fog  on  changing  the  electrical 
parameters. Provoked to further investigations by these findings, Read (1791) pursued a 
series of daily observations in London, using a vertical antenna connected to a pith ball 
electrometer.  There  are  many  examples  of  positive  electrification  during  fair  weather 
conditions.  In his summary of two  years of continuous observation from May 1789 to 
May  1791,  Read  recorded  423  days  of  positive  electricity,  157  days  of  negative 
electricity  and  106  days  on  which  the  electrification  was  sufficient  to  produce  sparks 
(Read, 1792). 
 
As well as Beccaria, de Saussure found diurnal variations in atmospheric electricity in 
European  measurements  made  between  1785  and  1788.  De  Saussure  records 
(Chauveau, 1925):  

In  winter,  the  season  during  which  I  have  the  best  observations  of  serene1 
electricity…the  electricity  undergoes  an  ebb  and  flow  like  the  tides,  which 
increases  and  decreases  twice  in  the  span  of  twenty-four  hours.  The  times  of 
greatest intensity are a few hours after sunrise and sunset, and the weakest before 
sunrise and sunset. 

This serves to illustrate the readiness with which a diurnal variation could be observed 
with  early  instrumentation:  although  any  physical  interpretation  now  can  only  be 
speculative,  the  double  diurnal  cycle  reported  may  have  been  related  to  variations  in 
local smoke pollution. 

1.2.2  Nineteenth century 
Several sets of surface quantitative atmospheric electrical data exist from the nineteenth 
century, mostly of the vertical Potential Gradient (section 1.3.1). In the UK, systematic 
measurements  of  the  Potential  Gradient  were  made  at  Kew  Observatory  near  London 
between 1844-7 by Sir Francis Ronalds (Ronalds, 1844; Scrase, 1934), using a lantern 
probe and straw electrometers2. A double diurnal cycle of the atmospheric electric field 
was  found,  which  remained  present  at  Kew  beyond  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century 
(Scrase, 1934). From 1861-1872, Wislizenus, a physician, made atmospheric electrical 
observations  in  St  Louis,  Missouri,  which  were  subsequently  analysed  for  solar  cycle 
effects (Bauer, 1925). Lord Kelvin made major improvements in the instrumentation in 
the  mid-nineteenth  century.  His  automatic  recording  apparatus  for  electric  field  was 
installed at Kew in 1860 (Scrase, 1934). Measurements using the Kelvin apparatus from 
1862-1864  at  Kew  are  reported  by  Everett  (1868),  and  the  electrical  measurements  at 
Kew  are  available  almost  continuously  from  1898  to  1981  (Harrison,  2003a).  Many 
other  European  measurement  stations  operated  in  the  nineteenth  century  (see  also 
Table 2),  and  long  series  of  observations  exist  from  Brussels  (1845-70),  Perpignan 
(1886-1911) as well as Florence, Greenwich and Paris. The effect of smoke pollution on 
these  urban  measurements  was  often  substantial  and  could  dominate  the  diurnal 
variation; consequently the electrical observations offer an indirect method by which the 
diurnal  smoke  variations  themselves  can  be  recovered  at  high  temporal  (and  in  some 
cases hourly) resolution (Mössinger, 2004).

1.2.3  Twentieth century 
Balloon  ascents  at  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century  and  beginning  of  the  twentieth 
century  provided  data  on  the  vertical  profiles  of  atmospheric  electrical  parameters, 
generally  finding  a  decrease  in  the  vertical  electric  field’s  magnitude  with  height 
(Chauveau,  1925;  Chalmers,  1967).  Balloon  and  airship  measurements  also  showed 
variations  in  the  electric  field  across  the  edges  of  stratiform  clouds  (Everling  and 
Wigand,  1921;  Wigand,  1928).  Other  developments  in  atmospheric  electricity  in  the 
first  part  of  the  twentieth  century  arose  from  the  established  observations  and 
campaigns,  such  as  those  in  Paris  (Chauveau,  1925)  and  at  Kew.  Following  the 
discovery  of  radioactivity  by  Becquerel,  V.F.Hess  discovered  cosmic  rays,  which 
provide an increase in ionisation with increasing height in the atmosphere (Hess, 1928). 
Gerdien  (1905)  designed  a  cylindrical  electrode 
to  determine  air 
conductivity, and the interactions of aerosols, clouds and ions became the formal study 
of fair weather atmospheric electricity. Systematic observations on the electrification of 
large  ions  (i.e.  small  radius  aerosols,  condensation  nuclei  and  cloud  condensation 
nuclei)  were  made  at  P.J.  Nolan's  laboratory  in  Eire  (O’Connor,  2000),  including 
aerosol  electricity  experiments  on  heavily  polluted  Dublin  air.  In  his  early  work,  the 
Nobel  laureate  C.T.R. Wilson  worked  on  fundamental  problems  of  fair  weather 
atmospheric  electricity  at  Cambridge  (Galison,  1997),  and  established  regular 
measurement  of  the  air-Earth  current  at  Kew  in  1909,  continuing  for  almost  70  years 
(Harrison  and  Ingram,  2004).  Related  research  groups  continued  at  the  Cavendish 
Laboratory and under J. A. Chalmers at Durham (Hutchinson and Wormell, 1968) until 
the early 1970s. 
 
The defining work of the early twentieth century, however, was the set of exploratory 
voyages of the wooden geomagnetic survey vessel Carnegie, operated by the Carnegie 
Institute  of  Washington.  Between  1909  and  its  destruction  by  fire  in  1929,  many 
sequences of standardised atmospheric electricity measurements were made around the 
world’s oceans. Oceanic air is particularly suitable for fair weather measurements as it 
is  usually  remote  from  continental  sources  of  aerosol  pollution,  and  the  characteristic 
universal variation of the atmospheric electric field is still known as the Carnegie curve 
from  the  data  obtained.  Together  with  pioneering  measurement  of  the  electrical 
conductivity of the stratosphere in 1935 using the balloon Explorer II (Israel, 1970) and 
C.T.R.Wilson’s  (1920,  1929)  global  circuit  theory,  the  Carnegie  data  strongly 
contributed  to  defining  the  twentieth  century  paradigm  of  fair  weather  atmospheric 
electricity. 
 

1.3  Surface measurements 
 

1.3.1  The potential gradient 
The vertical atmospheric electric field, or Potential Gradient3 (PG), is a widely studied 
electrical  property  of  the  atmosphere.  In  fair  weather  and  air  unpolluted  by  aerosol 
particles,  diurnal  variations  in  PG  result  from  changes  in  the  total  electrical  output  of 
global  thunderstorms  and  shower  clouds.  Even  early  PG  measurements,  such  as  those 
obtained  by Simpson  (1906) in Lapland, Figure 2, show  a variation  suggestive of that 
seen in more  modern work. A common global  diurnal  variation  results  from  a diurnal 

 

7

GEOP220 

variation in the ionospheric potential VI (Mülheisen, 1977), which modulates the vertical 
air-Earth conduction current Jz (figure 1) and, in the absence of local effects, the surface 
PG  (Paramanov,  1971).  VI  and  Jz  are  parameters  less  prone  to  effects  from  local 
pollution  and  are  therefore  more  suitable  for  global  geophysical  studies,  but  of  which 
far  fewer measurements  have  been  obtained  than of the surface  PG  (Dolezalek,  1972; 
Harrison 2003a). 
 

1.3.2  Small ions and air conductivity 
Small  ions  are  continually  produced  in  the  atmosphere  by  radiolysis  of  air  molecules. 
There  are  three  major  sources  of  high-energy  particles,  all  of  which  cause  ion 
production  in  air:  radon  isotopes,  cosmic  rays  and  terrestrial  gamma  radiation.  The 
partitioning between the sources varies vertically. Near the surface over land, ionisation 
from  turbulent  transport  of  radon  and  other  radioactive  isotopes  is  important,  together 
with gamma radiation from isotopes below the surface.  Ionisation from cosmic rays is 
always  present,  comprising  about  20%  of  the  ionisation  over  the  continental  surface. 
The cosmic ionisation  fraction increases  with  increasing height  in  the  atmosphere  and 
dominates above the planetary boundary layer. Cosmic ray properties are reviewed by 
Bazilevskaya (2000). 
 
After the PG, air conductivity is probably the second most frequently-measured surface 
quantity in atmospheric electricity. The slight electrical conductivity of atmospheric air 
results  from  the  natural  ionisation,  generated  by  cosmic  rays  and  background 
radioisotopes. For bipolar ion number concentrations n+ and n- the total air conductivity 
s  is given by 
 

s  = s + + s -  = e (µ + n+ + µ - n-) 

where  µ +  and  µ -  are  the  average  ion  mobilities,  with  s +  and s -   the  associated  polar 
conductivities. Air conductivity is strongly influenced by aerosol pollution: in aerosol-
polluted  air  it  is  considerably  reduced  by  ion-aerosol  attachment  (Dhanorkar  and 
Kamra, 1997).  In  both  aerosol-free  and polluted  air, the  PG  and air  conductivity  have 
been found to be related by Ohm’s Law 
Jz = s  Ez 
 

(1) 

(2) 

for a vertical air-Earth conduction current density Jz and PG of magnitude Ez. 
 
Balloon-carried  instruments  have  found  a  substantial  vertical  variation  in  the  air 
conductivity.  Using  data  from  the  Explorer  II  ascent  (Gish  and  Sherman,  1936),  Gish 
(1944) introduced the concept of the columnar resistance, as the resistance of a unit area 
column  of  atmosphere,  found  by  integration  of  the  conductivity  with  height.  The 
columnar  resistance  Rc  is  typically  ~120 PW m2.  The  bulk  of  the  resistance  of  a  unit 
column of atmosphere arises from ion attachment to aerosol present in the atmospheric 
boundary  layer;  the  conductivity  steadily  increases  with  increasing  cosmic  ray 
ionisation, up to the highly-conductive lower layers of the ionosphere.

1.3.3  Instrumentation for surface measurements 
Surface instrumentation  provides the  majority of atmospheric  electrical data available, 
and  this  Section  summarises  some  of  the  classical  techniques  for  measurement  of  the 
Potential Gradient, air conductivity and the vertical air-Earth current Jz. 
 
Early  PG  measurements  mostly  used  a  potential  probe  (also  known  as  a  collector), 
schematically represented in figure 3 (a). The PG is derived from the measured potential 
V  at  the  height  z  of  the  collector,  and  is  typically  150V.m-1  at  1m  under  fair  weather 
conditions, although this varies between sites and between land and sea. Many different 
collectors have been employed in the past, including a burning fuse (Scrase, 1934), the 
water dropper originated by Lord Kelvin (Chalmers, 1967), a radioactive source (Israel, 
1970) and a long horizontal wire antenna (Crozier, 1963; Harrison, 1997a). In all these 
approaches, the effective resistance between the air and the probe is reduced, either by 
increasing the area of the collector (long wire), or by introducing additional ions into the 
region  of  air  adjacent  to  the  collector  (burning  fuse,  water  dropper  and  radioactive 
source.) 
 
Gerdien  (1905)  developed  a  method  of  measuring  air  conductivity  using  a  cylindrical 
condenser. A voltage is applied between two cylindrical electrodes and the inner one is 
earthed via a sensitive ammeter, figure 3 (b).  In the tube, ions of the same sign as the 
polarising voltage are repelled by the outer electrode, and move in the electric field to 
meet  the  inner  electrode,  where  they  cause  a  small  current  i.  As  long  as  the  output 
current  is  proportional  to  the  polarising  voltage,  indicating  that  a  fixed  fraction  of  air 
ions are collected by the central electrode, the polar conductivity s + or s - is given by 
 

(3), 

s

– =

e
i 0
CV

 

where  C  is  the  capacitance  of  the  Gerdien  device,  and  V  the  polarising  voltage 
established across the electrodes, of appropriate sign for the ions selected, and e 0 is the 
permittivity of free space. 
 
Measurement  of  the  air-Earth  current  and  potential  gradient  was  combined  in  an 
instrument developed by C.T.R.Wilson, figure 3 (c). Wilson's apparatus (Wilson, 1906) 
consisted  of  a  portable  gold  leaf  electrometer,  connected  to  a  horizontal,  circular 
collecting  plate,  surrounded  by  an  earthed  guard  ring.  The  apparatus  also  included  a 
battery  and  a  variable  capacitor  (or  compensator),  by  which  the  potential  of  the 
collecting  plate  could  be  changed,  and  a  brass  cover  for  the  collecting  plate.  From  a 
sequence of covering and uncovering the plate, and timing the change in potential, the 
air-Earth current density Jz and mean PG could be found. (A further important aspect of 
the apparatus was the compensation of displacement currents, which are produced as a 
result of short-term PG fluctuations.) 
 
In  modern  applications,  PG  measurement  is  usually  made  using  mechanical  field 
machines  (Chalmers,  1967),  more  commonly  called  field  mills.  Field  machines 
generally  offer  a  more  rapid  time  response  and  dynamic  range  (Chubb,  1990; 
MacGorman and Rust, 1998) but may require maintenance with atmospheric exposure. 
The  Gerdien  instrument  continues  to  provide  the  physical  basis  on  which  modern  ion 
counting instruments are still designed (Blakeslee and Krider, 1992; Hõrrak et al., 1998),

although  computer  control  of  the  bias  voltage  and  current  measurements  is  becoming 
more common (Aplin and Harrison, 2000, 2001; Holden, 2004). Direct measurement of 
the  air-Earth  current  has  been  achieved  using  a  split-hemisphere  collector,  suspended 
above  the  surface,  within  which  the  current  amplifiers  are  housed  (Burke  and  Few, 
1978). This has also proved durable under Antarctic conditions (Byrne et al., 1993). A 
further  effective  method  of  air-earth  current  measurement  is  the  long  wire  antenna 
collector (Tammet et al., 1996). 
 
One characteristic of fair-weather atmospheric measurements is that the signal voltages 
are  present  at  high  source  impedance,  and  therefore  sensitive  electrometry  techniques 
are  required.  The  necessary  electrometer  dynamic  range  has  usually  required  a  high 
value  potential  divider,  but  the  resistor  technology  introduces  thermal  stability  issues. 
This  problem  can  be  circumvented  by  circuit  design  (Harrison,  1996,  2002a),  at 
sufficiently low cost that the equipment is disposable and therefore suitable for use with 
non-recovered  balloon-carried  instrumentation  (Harrison,  2001).  In  the  related  area  of 
ultra-low electric current measurements, compensation of temperature-dependent errors 
(Harrison and Aplin, 2000a) and power line interference (Harrison, 1997b) can now be 
achieved with stable current references (Harrison and Aplin, 2000b). High integrity of 
insulation is always necessary, and, although the data logging can readily be automated, 
removal of cobwebs and general contamination requires regular maintenance. 

2  The global circuit  
The  classical  concept  of  a  global  electrical  circuit  was  suggested  by  C.T.R.Wilson 
(Wilson, 1920, 1929), following the first reports of a universal time diurnal variation in 
the  electrical  parameters  (Hoffman,  1924),  and  knowledge  of  the  conductive  upper 
regions of the atmosphere inferred from radio wave investigations (Fleming, 1939). The 
global atmospheric electrical circuit arises from a balance between charge generation in 
disturbed weather regions and a globally distributed current of small ions flowing in fair 
weather regions (Rycroft et al., 2000). This is shown schematically on the left-hand side 
of  figure 1.  This  simplified  representation  is  generally  understood  as  a  low  latitude 
direct current (DC) atmospheric electric circuit as, at high latitudes, polar cap potentials 
contribute additional currents. 
 
As  well  as  providing  a  global  equipotential  region,  the  ionosphere  provides  the  upper 
boundary  of  a  spherical  resonant  cavity.  Excitation  of  the  earth-ionosphere  cavity  by 
lightning-generated  electromagnetic  energy  causes  alternating  current  (AC)  effects, 
notably  the  Extremely  Low  Frequency  (ELF)  Schumann  resonance  at  ~8Hz  (e.g. 
Rycroft  et  al.,  2000),  the  intensity  of  which  is  closely  related  to  the  total  amount  of 
planetary  lightning.  Because  the  DC  circuit  responds  to  current  generation  from  both 
shower  clouds  and  thunderstorms,  differences  arise  between  the  DC  parameter  of  the 
lightning-driven  Schumann  resonance  amplitude. 
ionospheric  potential  and 
Existence  of  an  ELF  resonance  on  other  bodies  of  the  solar  system  seems  likely:  a 
fundamental ELF frequency of 11-15Hz has been postulated for Titan (Morente et al., 
2003),  and  13-14Hz  for  Mars  (Sukhorukov,  1991).  Since  planetary  (or  satellite)  ELF 
resonances  require  the  combination  of  an  upper  atmospheric  conducting  layer  and 
sources of atmospheric electrical discharges, detection of ELF indicates the existence of 

the

an  AC  atmospheric  electrical  circuit.  For  a  DC  circuit  to  be  present  in  the  terrestrial 
sense, additional evidence of current flow is required.

2.1  Carnegie diurnal variation 
Section 1.3.1 introduced  the diurnal  variation  in PG identified  in  data  obtained  during 
the  voyages  of  the  Carnegie.  As  well  as  the  surface  PG,  the  universal  diurnal  or 
Carnegie curve appears  in the  other  global circuit  parameters,  notably  the ionospheric 
potential  (Section  2.2.1)  (Mülheisen,  1977)  and  air-Earth  current  (Section  2.2.2)  (e.g. 
Adlerman and Williams, 1996). A positive correlation between the Carnegie curve and 
diurnal variation in global thunderstorm area was discovered by Whipple, by summing 
the  diurnal  variations  in  thunderstorm  area  for  each  of  Africa,  Australia  and  America 
(Whipple,  1929;  Whipple  and  Scrase,  1936).  The  thunderstorm  areas  were  estimated 
using  thunderday4  statistics  from  meteorological  stations,  compiled  by  Brooks (1925). 
Figure  4  (a)  shows  the  diurnal  variations  in  surface  PG  and  thunderstorm  area:  the 
correlation  between  the  24  data  points  is  +0.93.  The  Carnegie  curve  is  tabulated  in 
Israel (1973),  and its  values are  also given in  Table 2,  together with  the  thunderstorm 
areas of Whipple and Scrase (1936) from thunderday data.

In  a  more  modern  analysis  of  available  global  data,  Paramanov  (1971)  confirmed  a 
Universal Time diurnal variation in both the PG and air-Earth current, for all seasons. 
Later  analysis  of  the  global  thunderstorm  area  variation,  however,  has  produced  less 
conclusive  results  than  Whipple  and  Scrase  (1936).  Krumm(1962)  analysed  World 
Meteorological  Organisation  records  by  latitude  band  and  season  and  found  a  global 
maximum  around  14UT;  Dolezalek  (1972)  found  a  diurnal  maximum  at  16UT.  This 
paradox  between  the  thunderstorm  area  and  universal  diurnal  variation  data  can  be 
resolved  if,  as  well  as  substantial  African  thunderstorm  contributions  to  the  global 
circuit  around  14-15UT,  there  are  large  current  contributions  from  South  American 
shower clouds around 20UT (Williams and Sátori, 2004). 
 
Figure  4(b)  presents  the  original  Universal  Time  variation  data  in  an  alternative  way. 
This figure has been drawn to emphasise the effect of differences in the amplitude of the 

 

12

GEOP220 

in  global 

diurnal  curves  of  thunderstorm  area  and  PG  in  Figure  4  (a).  It  is  clear  that,  as  the 
thunderstorm area tends to zero, there is a non-zero intercept. This implied existence of 
the PG in the absence of continental thunderstorms was originally thought to be due to 
the presence of oceanic thunderstorms (Whipple, 1929), neglected in the thunderstorm 
area  evaluation,  for  which  an  arbitrary  offset,  with  no  diurnal  variations,  was  added 
(Williams  and  Heckman,  1993).  In  a  review  of  earlier  work  by  Wormell  (1953),  the 
negative charge of the Earth’s surface was estimated to arise from the balance between 
fair  weather  current  (60C.yr-1.km-2)  and  precipitation  (30  C.yr-1.km-2),  lightning  (-20 
C.yr-1.km-2) and point-discharge currents (-100C.yr-1.km-2), indicating that lightning was 
not the dominant charging agent. Williams and Heckman (1993) argued that the corona 
and precipitation current contributions to the conduction currents at the surface are the 
principal  source  of  charging  of  the  global  circuit,  emphasising  the  role  of  electrified 
shower clouds as originally suggested by Wilson (1920). In support of this view, recent 
satellite  lightning  observations  have  shown  that  there  is  little  marine  lightning 
lightning  alone  are  not 
(Christian,  2003).  Furthermore,  variations 
quantitatively  sufficient  to  account  for  the  variations  in  the  global  circuit.  In  a  study 
comparing  ELF  measurements  (used  as  a  proxy  for  global  lightning)  with  the  PG 
measured  in  the  Antarctic,  the  mean  variations  were  similar  but  the  hourly  departures 
were less well correlated (Füllekrug et al., 1999). Füllekrug et al. (1999) reported that 
the contribution of lightning to the global circuit to was ~40 ± 10%.  
 
Surface  PG  observations  show  that  the  Carnegie  curve  has  been  largely  unchanged 
during  the  twentieth  century.  At  Eskdalemuir  (Scotland)  and  Lerwick  (Shetland),    a 
long  series  of  hourly  PG  measurements  was  made  in  clean  air,  under  standardised 
conditions (Harrison, 2003a). The records began in Scotland in 1908 and at Shetland in 
1926, continuing until both stations ceased atmospheric electrical measurements in the 
early  1980s.  Figure  5(a)  shows  averaged  daily  variations  of  PG  obtained  at  Lerwick 
1968-1973,  compared  with  the  Carnegie  curve  and  the  contemporary  ionospheric 
potential  changes  found  by  Mülheisen  (Budyko,  1971).  There are qualitative  similarities 
with the PG variation found by Simpson at Karasjok in 1903, Figure 2, again indicating 
some temporal consistency in the diurnal variation across the twentieth century. 
 
Averaging  many  fair  weather  days  of  surface  PG  data  is  usually  necessary  for  the 
Carnegie  curve  to  appear,  both  because  of  local  aerosol  influences  and  also  because 
day-to-day  variability  in  the  global  circuit–modulating  thunderstorms  may  prevent  the 
standard variation occurring every day. This is supported by the original measurements 
(Torreson,  1946)  on  Cruise VII  of  the  Carnegie  (1928-1929),  in  which  diurnal 
variations  close  to,  but  different  from,  that  subsequently  identified  as  the  standard 
variation were occasionally observed on fair weather days, without any averaging. On at 
least one occasion during Cruise VII, a similar, but non-standard diurnal variation was 
observed  simultaneously  on  the  Carnegie  and  at  Eskdalemuir  (Harrison,  2004a). 
Figure 5(b)  shows  a  series  of  six-hourly  PG  values  obtained  on  the  Carnegie  in 
September 1928, with measurements  made  on  undisturbed  days  at  Eskdalemuir. From 
the 12 to 17 September 1928, there was a significant correlation (r = 0.56 for 20 values) 
between the PG observed on the Carnegie  and at Eskdalemuir, with particularly close 
agreement on the 15 and 16 September. The absolute values of PG between the two sets 
of measurement differ, however, which is likely to be due to local factors, such as the 

 

13

GEOP220 

presence of aerosol or local geological properties influencing the surface ion production 
and the associated air conductivity. 
 
Figure  6  shows  average  diurnal  variations  in  potential  in  pioneering  measurements 
made by B. Chauveau in Paris (Chauveau 1893a, 1893b, 1925), in the summer of 1893. 
These  were  made  both  at  the  surface,  and  at  the  top  of  the  Eiffel  Tower,  using  the 
Kelvin water dropper apparatus with autographic recording (Harrison and Aplin, 2003). 
There  are  qualitative  differences  between  the  two  sets  of  measurements.  In  particular, 
the  surface  measurements  have  two  maxima,  in  common  with  those  also  found  in 
London in the nineteenth century (Scrase, 1934), which were due to the similar diurnal 
variations  in  smoke  pollution  (Harrison  and  Aplin,  2002).  The  contrast  between  the 
lower and upper measurements is mentioned by Chauveau (1925): 
 

In  observations  made  during  the  summer  and  autumn  months,  we  noted  that, 
rather  than  the  strongly  marked  double  period  oscillation  found  at  the  lower 
station,  the  variation  simultaneously  obtained  at  the  upper  station  has  a  very 
different character when averaged, clearly showing a single oscillation. After the 
morning  minimum,  occurring  exactly  at  the  same  time  at  the  two  stations,  the 
potential  seen  around  the  top  of  the  Eiffel  Tower  increases  steadily  until  an 
evening  maximum  which  occurs  an  hour  earlier  than  the  maximum  observed  at 
the base station. 

 The  single  maximum  in  the  data  from  the  top  of  the  Eiffel  Tower,  and  the  increased 
amplitude  over  the  Carnegie  curve,  result  from  a  combination  of  the  global  circuit 
modulation  nocturnally  with  the  diurnal  variation  in  transport  of  polluted  urban 
boundary layer air past the sensor (Harrison and Aplin, 2003). 

2.2  DC aspects of global circuit 
In  the  DC  global  circuit,  the  ionospheric  potential  VI  causes  the  vertical  conduction 
current  Jz  to  flow  through  the  combined  vertical  resistance  of  the  troposphere  and 
stratosphere (see also Section 1.3.2.). From the measured air-Earth current and planetary 
surface  area,  an  estimate  of  the  total  current  flowing  in  the  global  circuit  is  2000A. 
Assuming a simple circuit and applying Ohm's Law, the global electrical resistance RT 
is  about  230W.  The  lower  part  of  the  troposphere,  the  boundary  layer,  contributes  a 
significant part of the vertical resistance. RT can be found by integrating the variation of 
air conductivity with height as

where  R  is  the  Earth’s  radius.  Variations  in  RT  arise  from  changes  in  cosmic  ray 
ionisation,  clouds  and  aerosols:  it  may  therefore  reflect  long-term  climate  changes  or 
changes in the abundance of volcanic aerosol. The concentric sphere system formed by 
the  conducting  ionosphere  surrounding  the  planet  has  a  finite  capacitance,  with  a  RC 
time constant of ~10 minutes. The continued existence of an atmospheric electric field, 
despite  this  rapid  discharging  timescale,  was  the  original  indication  that  electrical 
generation processes are continuously active (Chalmers, 1967).

2.2.1  The ionospheric potential 
The  ionospheric  potential  VI  is  the  potential  of  the  lowest  conducting  regions  of  the 
ionosphere, reckoned with respect to a zero potential at the surface. It is obtained from 
vertical soundings of the variation of PG with height, E(z) using a sensor carried on an 
ascending balloon or aircraft, and the total potential calculated by integration,

Because the air conductivity increases substantially in the upper troposphere, the value 
of  VI  does  not  have  a  high  sensitivity  to  the  upper  limit,  zI,  of  the  ascent  (Markson, 
1976). Many intermittent measurements of VI exist from the late 1950s (Imyanitov and 
Chubarina,  1967;  Markson,  1976,  1985;  Markson  et  al.,  1999).  Those  of  Mülheisen 
(Budyko, 1971) obtained in Germany between 1959 and 1972 are notable for providing 
important  support  for  the  global  circuit  concept  from  the  common  simultaneous 
variations  in  VI  found  at  different  locations  (Mülheisen,  1971).  Figure  7  shows  the 
comparison between simultaneous VI soundings made in Weissenau, Germany, and over 
the Atlantic from the research ship Meteor. In the semi-continuous measurement period 
between  17  March  and  2  April  1969,  there  was  both  quantitative  and  qualitative 
agreement  in  the  VI  values  obtained  (correlation  coefficient  r = 0.82,  N = 15  values).  
Figure 7 also includes the measurements of surface PG obtained at Lerwick at the same 
UT hour as the soundings of Mülheisen, for fair weather or non-precipitating periods. 
There  is  also  clearly  good  agreement  between  the  determination  of  VI  (averaged  from 
the two simultaneous soundings) and the Lerwick PG data, (r = 0.87, N= 10). 
 
Increases  in  surface  temperature  leading  to  more  vigorous  convection  have  been 
quantitatively  linked  with  increases  in  VI  (Price,  1993),  offering  a  possible  indirect 
method of monitoring surface temperatures. For example, a positive correlation between 
three different global temperature datasets and VI (Markson and Price, 1999), supporting 
a relationship between warmer temperatures and an increased VI. 
 

2.2.2  The conduction current 
The conduction current was defined in Section 1.3, and is related to the resistance Rc of 
a unit area column of atmosphere and ionospheric potential by 
 
 

(6) 

=

J

where Jz is the conduction current density. At the surface, Jz can be determined as the 
current flowing from the atmosphere to ground, the air-Earth current density, of which 
a long series (1909-1979) of approximately weekly measurements exists from Kew near 
London  using  the  Wilson  apparatus  (Harrison  and  Ingram,  2004).  Continuous 
measurements  of  the  air-Earth  current  in  clean  air  (at  Hawaii)  were  made  with  other 
atmospheric electrical parameters during 1962 (Cobb, 1968). 
 
Measurement of Jz will not provide a method of monitoring changes in the global circuit 
if the columnar resistance varies locally (Markson, 1988). However, if Rc is constant, Jz 
may be closely linked to VI. Evidence for this comes from averaging measurements of Jz 

 

15

GEOP220 

which,  in  oceanic  air,  also  show  the  Carnegie  curve  (Gringel  et  al.,  1986).  In  balloon 
soundings,  Jz  has  been  found  to  be  constant  with  height  above  the  boundary  layer 
(Gringel, 1978). 
 

2.3  AC aspects of the global circuit 
The production of ELF radiation by lightning offers a direct method of monitoring the 
temporal  variation  of  terrestrial  lightning.  Williams  (1994)  has  shown  that  lightning 
flash rates are proportional to temperature, and it has been suggested that the Schumann 
(ELF)  resonance  could  offer  a  method  of  monitoring  global  temperature  (Williams, 
1992). A significant advantage of using the Schumann resonance over the ionospheric 
potential (Section 2.2.1) to monitor global thunderstorms is that ELF measurements can 
be  made  at  the  surface  in  electromagnetically  quiet  regions  and,  therefore,  that  no 
balloon  soundings  are  required.  As  a  result,  short-term  (seconds  to  hourly)  temporal 
changes can be monitored (Märcz et al., 1997). Study of the AC (i.e. lightning-related) 
aspects of the global circuit is also unaffected by continental aerosol, which contributes 
variability in the columnar resistance of the DC global circuit. Temperature effects on 
the global circuit are considered further in Section 3.2.4. 

2.3.1  Satellite observations of lightning 
Observations of lightning can be made by meteorological lightning detection (“sferics”) 
networks, or obtained from satellite, which view a large proportion of the thunderstorm-
producing  regions  of  the  planet.  Early  satellite  observations  of  the  distribution  of 
midnight lightning (Orville and Henderson, 1986) showed that there was more lightning 
over land and that the lightning frequency had a maximum in the northern hemisphere 
summer.  More  recent  sensors,  including  the  NASA  Optical  Transient  Detector  (OTD) 
and  Lightning  Imaging  Sensor  (LIS),  are  able  to  detect  lightning  under  daylight 
conditions  (Christian,  1999;  Christian  et  al.,  2003).  Detailed  climatologies  of  the 
planetary lightning distribution now exist. These show that 78% of all lightning occurs 
between  30°S  and  30°N,  with  Africa  the  greatest  source  region  of  lightning  and  that 
there is a global mean land to ocean lightning flash ratio of 10:1 (Christian, 2003). 
 

2.4  Non-diurnal modulations 
Modulation  of  the  global  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  occurs  on  both  diurnal  and 
seasonal cycles. The diurnal cycle is sufficiently well established that it can be used for 
preliminary identification of data of possible global validity (Märcz and Harrison, 2003; 
Harrison, 2004b). There are fewer observations with which to identify seasonal, intra-
seasonal (Anyamba et al., 2000) and longer-term changes. 
 

2.4.1  Seasonal variation 
Satellite  observations  of visible  lightning  provide  high-resolution  data  on  the  seasonal 
variation of lightning. The northern hemisphere lightning, associated with the majority 
of the planetary land area, contributes the majority of the global lightning. The  global 
flash  rate  has  a  maximum  during  the  northern  hemisphere  (NH)  summer  (Figure  8a). 
Early  measurements  of  surface  Potential  Gradient,  however,  show  a  maximum  in  the 
NH  winter.  The  1903/4  Lapland  PG  data  (Figure  2),  for  example,  show  what  was 

 

16

GEOP220 

originally  assumed  to  the  seasonal  variation;  many  other  early  NH  datasets  show  this 
(Chauveau, 1925). 
 
By  comparing  northern  and  southern  hemisphere  PG  data,  Adlerman  and 
Williams (1996)  argued  that  variations  in  NH  continental  smoke  pollution  were  the 
origin of the NH winter PG maximum. The pollution shows a maximum in the winter; 
consequently  the  PG  measurements  may  not  be  representative  of  the  global  circuit’s 
seasonality. Reanalysing all the data obtained on the Carnegie voyages, and those of the 
Maud,  another  early  twentieth  century  survey  vessel,  Adlerman  and  Williams (1996) 
found  a  maximum  in  PG  in  June/July,  consistent  with  the  maximum  in  lightning 
occurrence. 
 
In  an  analysis  of  data  obtained  at  the  Marsta  station  in  Sweden  between  1993-1998, 
Israelsson  and  Tammet  (2001)  show  the  strongest  correlation  between  the  local  PG 
variation and the Carnegie curve in the NH winter (r = 0.96). A similar behaviour has 
been found in data from the UK and Hungary (Märcz and Harrison, 2003), and in data 
from the Bavarian Alps (Harrison, 2004b). Since these studies consider the shape of the 
Carnegie  curve,  rather  than  the  absolute  magnitude,  these  observations  could  suggest 
that  either  the  DC  global  circuit  is  at  its  strongest  during  the  winter,  or  short-term 
changes are particularly small, or a combination of the two factors. Short-term (hourly) 
fluctuations  may  arise  in  the  summer  measurements  from  the  effects  of  local 
thunderstorms. Figure 8 (b) shows the PG data from cruise VII of the Carnegie, plotted 
as  monthly  averages.  There  are  variations  in  the  shape  of  the  curve  from  summer  to 
winter, and in the timing of the maxima and minima. Important though these data are in 
the development of atmospheric electricity, they span less than two years, and may not 
be representative of the average seasonal variation. 
 
Although  the  seasonality  in  lightning  is  well-established  and  drives  the  AC  global 
circuit, Section 2.2 emphasised that lightning is not the sole source of variability in the 
DC  global  circuit.  The  seasonality  in  the  AC  and  DC  circuits  may  not  therefore  be 
exactly linked. Furthermore, changes in the columnar resistance, caused by the seasonal 
variations  in  cloud  and  aerosol,  will  affect  currents  flowing  in  the  DC  global  circuit. 
These factors will need to be considered further in definitively determining the seasonal 
variation, in the absence of direct long-term monitoring of the DC global circuit. 
 

2.4.2  Cosmic ray modulation  
A small observed modulation in VI has been linked to cosmic ray variations arising from 
the  solar  cycle  (Markson,  1981):  cosmic  ray  ionisation  modifies  the  atmosphere’s 
columnar  resistance.  VI  increased  when  an  increase  in  cosmic  rays  occurred.  Markson 
(1981)  showed  that,  for  the  increase  in  cosmic  rays  to  increase  VI,  the  change  has  to 
influence the charging part of the global electric circuit. 
 
The cosmic ray effect on VI was originally identified from the solar modulation of low 
energy  cosmic  rays,  which  occurs  from  the  solar  variations  on  the  eleven-year  cycle. 
Interaction  between  the  solar  wind  and  cosmic  rays  leads  to  an  inverse  phase 
relationship between solar activity and cosmic rays arriving at Earth. A more active Sun 
therefore  reduces  the  cosmic  ray  flux  penetrating  down  into  the  Earth’s  lower 

 

17

GEOP220 

atmosphere,  and  the  steady  increase  in  solar  activity  during  the  twentieth  century  has 
lead  to  a  secular  decline  in  cosmic  rays  (Carslaw  et  al.,  2002).  The  expected  global 
circuit  response  may  have  been  identified  in  surface  measurements  of  PG  (Harrison, 
2002b; Märcz and Harrison, 2003), although aerosol changes have also been suggested 
to  cause  the  effect  (Williams,  2003;  Harrison,  2003b).  A  twentieth  century  decline  is, 
however,  also  apparent  in  oceanic  measurements  of  PG  (Harrison,  2004a),  which 
supports  a  global  circuit  change  (see  also  Section  3.1.1.)  A  decrease  in  the  air-Earth 
current at Kew (Harrison and  Ingram, 2004) and in the PG in mountain air (Harrison, 
2004b) is apparent in the 1970s. 

3  Changes in the global circuit and climate 

3.1  Reconstruction of past global circuit variations 
The  pioneering  measurements  described  in  Section  1.2  are  of  historical  importance  in 
understanding the development of atmospheric electricity, but they have recently found 
a  new  use  in  extracting  information  on  past  urban  air  pollution  conditions.  Another 
atmospheric use for the early measurements is emerging, as studies of past climates and 
more recent atmospheric changes are increasingly used to provide a comparative basis 
for research on climate change. In the case of global air temperature for example, early 
observations  have  been  used  to  quantify  past  temperature  changes,  globally  or 
regionally.  The  longest  such  temperature  series,  the  Central  England  Temperature 
series,  extends  back  to  1698  (Manley,  1953).  Such  an  approach  of  instrumental 
reconstruction  should,  in  principle,  be  possible  for  the  global  atmospheric  electrical 
circuit. Because of its global nature in fair weather conditions and clean air, rather fewer 
instrumental  measurements  would  seem  likely  to  be  needed  than  for  computing  the 
global temperature. In many cases the experimental work is recorded in sufficient detail 
for  the  instruments  to  be  simulated  and  estimates  of  their  reliability  made.  Even  so, 
major  difficulties  remain  in  attempting  to  reconstruct  the  past  state  of  the  global 
electrical circuit, including the absolute calibration of early instrumentation, changes in 
the exposure of the measurement sites and gaps for which no data are available. 
 
A comparable approach in paleoclimate studies is the use of proxy methods to estimate 
changes  in  past  conditions.  A  suitable  proxy  has  a  known  relationship  to  the  physical 
quantity actually required, and its variations are known for the period of interest, usually 
when  the  physical  quantity  is  not  known  directly.  Proxy  methods  have  been  used  to 
infer long-term variations in solar output, from records of cosmogenic isotopes, which 
respond inversely to solar changes. Central to both the instrumental and proxy methods 
for a global atmospheric circuit reconstruction is, however, the availability of long-term, 
globally-valid measurements. 
 

3.1.1  Early measurements 

Table 3 lists the locations of early surface measurement stations and Figure 9 illustrates 
the periods of operation of a subset, including the UK sites. As a first stage in selecting 
data  of  possible  global  significance,  the  diurnal  variations  described  in  Section  1.1.1 
may be used to reject data primarily influenced by local pollution. The Carnegie curve 
provides one method for identifying periods of data in which global circuit signals may 

 

18

GEOP220 

be present (Harrison, 2002b) or, from the absence of the universal diurnal cycle, when 
the PG is dominated by  local influences (Harrison and Aplin, 2002). This approach is 
necessary  when  little  or  no  additional  information  beyond  the  PG  measurements  is 
available. The existence of a similar variation to the Carnegie curve is not, however, a 
sufficient  condition  for  global  circuit  monitoring,  as  it  may  have  arisen  from  local 
changes  having  the  same  phase  variation  by  chance.  Identification  of  global  circuit 
variations  requires  additional  corroboration  with  simultaneous  atmospheric  electrical 
changes found at other sites (Harrison, 2004a, 2004b). 

 
A  long-term  decline  in  the  average  annual  PG  was  first  observed  in  data  from 
Eskdalemuir  in  rural  Scotland  (Harrison,  2002b).  In  urban  air  at  Kew,  the  data  are 
strongly affected by local smoke pollution from London, but there is an annual cycle in 
air  pollution,  with  the  smoke  effects  at  Kew  smallest  in  the  summer  (Harrison  and 
Aplin, 2002). When the annual PG measurements from Eskdalemuir are compared with 
the Kew June PG measurements in the first half of the twentieth century, a similar rate 
of  decline  emerges,  see  figure  10a.  (This  is  also  found  in  the  PG  data  from  Lerwick, 
which used identical instrumentation, for the summer months of June, July and August.) 
Williams (2003)  has  suggested  that  a  steady  decrease  in  continental  aerosol  could 
explain  the  decrease  in  the  PG  found  at  Eskdalemuir.  Although  this  is  physically 
plausible,  Harrison  (2003b)  argued  that,  before  the  UK  Clean  Air  Acts  of  the  1950s, 
systematic decreases in smoke were unlikely, as the Clean Air legislation resulted from 
more  frequent  and  more  damaging  air  pollution  episodes.  Furthermore,  there  are  air-
Earth current measurements for a similar period in the UK, using the Wilson apparatus 
(section 1.3.3). This apparatus also measured the air conductivity, which is the physical 
parameter modulated by smoke pollution. (For constant Jz, the PG and conductivity are 
proportional,  from  equation  2.)  A  greater  decline  in  the  air-Earth  current  than  in  the 
positive  air  conductivity  is  found  at  Kew  in  June,  from  the  available  data  from  1932-
1948 (Harrison and Ingram, 2004). This supports the decline in the measured PG being 
due  to  air-Earth  current  (i.e.  global  circuit  changes),  rather  than  air  conductivity  (i.e. 
local pollution) changes.

3.1.2  Proxies for changes in the global circuit 
Other than early direct measurements, one of the longest sources of local atmospheric 
electrical data is the regular meteorological reporting of thunderdays, which formed the 
basis of early (Brooks, 1925) and later (Krumm, 1962; Dolezalek, 1972) studies on the 
global  circuit.  Thunderdays  have  been  investigated  for  possible  solar  influences 
(Brooks,  1934):  there  are  close  statistical  correlations  apparent  in  some  regions 
(Stringfellow, 1974; Schlegel et al., 2001). The widespread recording of the occurrence 
of  thunder  has  suggested  a  possible  route  for  investigating  global  electrical  changes 
(Changnon,  1985),  but  the  trends  in  different  continental  areas  vary,  suggesting  that 
local  factors  may  dominate.  On  millennial  timescales,  historical  evidence  from  China 
indicates  three  major  peaks  in  winter  thunderstorm  activity  in  200-600AD,  1100-
1300AD and 1600-1800AD (Wang, 1980). 
 

From the perspective of understanding global circuit changes, a more quantitative proxy 
is  desirable.  Since  the  global  circuit  requires  cosmic  ray  ionisation  to  cause  ion 
production  and  with  it  the  conductivity  of  air,  cosmic  ray  measurements  provide 
information  on  an  important  physical  aspect.  Direct  measurements  of  cosmic  ray 
secondary  particles  with  surface  neutron  counters  began  in  the  1950s,  with  ionisation 
chambers collecting the data before then, such as those carried on the Carnegie cruises. 
Before the first decade of the twentieth century, proxies for cosmic rays provide indirect 
measurements of the atmospheric ion production rate. Such cosmic ray proxies indicate 
possible  changes  in  the  columnar  resistance  of  air  within  the  global  circuit  (Section 
2.4.2), and may permit the calibration of modern VI and PG data to obtain past estimates 
of their variations. Estimates of  cosmic ray variation during the Phanerozoic (the past 
500 million  years)  have  been  claimed  from  meteorite  data  (Shaviv  and  Veizer,  2003). 
Over  shorter  timescales  (the  past  100,000  years),  one  proxy  for  global  cosmic  ray 
intensity  is  the  cosmogenic  nuclide  beryllium-10,  which  is  generated  by  spallation 
reactions of cosmic rays in the stratosphere. A long archive of Be-10 data exists from an 
analysis  of  deposits  in  the  Greenland  ice  core,  which  readily  shows  the  11 year  solar 
cycle modulation of cosmic rays (Beer, 2000). 
 
Evidence discussed in Section 3.1.1 suggests a global circuit change may have occurred 
during  at  least  the  first  half  of  the  twentieth  century.  Should  this  be  solely  due  to 
changes  in  the  columnar  resistance  from  cosmic  ray  ionisation  at  the  same  time,  it  is 
possible  that  the  Be-10  measurements  could  offer  a  proxy  for  variations  in  the 
atmospheric  electrical  circuit  (Harrison,  2002b),  beyond  the  period  of  the  direct 
observations. A further reason for the possible usefulness of Be-10 is that it is formed in 
the  upper  part  of  the  atmosphere,  where  cosmic  ray  ion  production  modulates  the 
charging  part  of  the  global  circuit.  Figure  10 (b)  shows  the  smoothed  Be-10  variation 
from  1600  (Beer,  2002),  calculated  as  a  fraction  of  the  mean  ice  core  Be-10 
concentration from 1900-1950. The relative PG variation shown in Figure 10 (a) is also 
plotted for the period 1900-1950 in Figure 10(b). Quantitative comparison requires the 
Be-10  relationship  with  atmospheric  ion  production  to  be  calculated,  but  there  is  a 
physical  basis  for  expecting  the  global  circuit  and  cosmic  ray  ion  production  to  be 
linked through columnar resistance changes (Markson, 1981).

3.2  Consequence of changes in  atmospheric electrification  

3.2.1  Electrical effects on cloud microphysics 
There  is  a  considerable  variety  in  the  sizes  and  abundance  of  aerosol  particles,  ice 
crystals  and  cloud  droplets  present  in  the  atmosphere.  The  typical  molecular  cluster 
comprising an atmospheric small ion will have a diameter of less than one nanometre. 
Aerosols  have  diameters  from  3nm  to  10µm,  and  cloud  and  raindrops  have  diameters 
from 10µm to 1mm. The complexity of cloud microphysical processes results from both 
the  different  particle  sizes  and  compositions  in  atmospheric  clouds,  and  the  phase 
changes between solid and liquid (Mason, 1971; Pruppacher and Klett, 1997). 
 
Aerosol electrification in the atmosphere occurs from ion-aerosol attachment, facilitated 
by ion transport in electric fields (Pauthenier, 1956), by diffusion (Gunn 1955; Fuchs, 
1963;  Bricard,  1965;  Boisdron  and  Brock,  1970).  Chemical  asymmetries  in  the  ion 
properties  generally  result in a charge distribution on the aerosol, which, although the 
distribution  may  have  a  small  mean  charge,  does  not  preclude  the  existence  of 
transiently  highly  charged  particles  within  the  ensemble.  In  the  special  case  of 
radioactive aerosols, the charge arises from a competition between the self-generation of 
charge  within  the  particle,  and  ions  diffusing  to  the  particle  (Clement  and  Harrison, 
1992;  Gensdarmes  et  al.,  2001).  The  aerosol  charge  distribution  can  affect  aerosol 
coagulation  rates  (Clement  et  al.,  1995),  which  in  turn  may  modify  the  particle  size 
distribution.  
 
Recent  review  papers  discuss  the  detailed  electrical  microphysics  which  links  cloud 
processes with atmospheric electrification (Harrison, 2000; Carslaw et al., 2002). Two 
aerosol-related topics identified are : 

(1) Cosmic ray generated atmospheric ions have been shown theoretically to lead to 
the  formation  of  atmospheric  Condensation  Nuclei  (Yu  and  Turco,  2001),  for 
which  there  is  some  experimental  support  (Wilkening,  1985;  Harrison  and 
Aplin, 2001). 

(2) Aerosol  electrification  can  modify  the  rate  at  which  the  aerosol  particles  are 
collected  by  water  drops,  which  may  affect  the  freezing  of  supercooled  water 
drops. (Tinsley et al., 2000; Tripathi and Harrison, 2002). 

More  quantitative  discussions  of  these  mechanisms,  based  on  the  theory  already 
available, are given in Harrison and Carslaw (2003). 
 
In  the  first  case,  atmospheric  effects  would  occur  through  changes  in  ion  production, 
leading  in  turn  to  changes  in  aerosol  nucleation,  ion-aerosol  attachment  rates,  aerosol 
charge  equilibration  times  and  aerosol  coagulation  rates,  ultimately  modifying  clouds. 
Direct evidence for the growth of ions in humid air with low aerosol content has been 
reported  from  the  naturally  radioactive  Carlsbad  Caverns,  New  Mexico  (Wilkening, 
1985),  where  ion  complexes  having  mobilities  considerably  smaller  than  atmospheric 
small ions have been observed. Decrease in ion mobility results from an increase in ion 
size.  
 
In  the  second  case  listed  above,  the  electric  fields  caused  by  the  global  circuit  could 
affect aerosol charging by modifying the ion environment on the boundaries of clouds 
where  ion  concentrations  are  profoundly  asymmetric  and  the  electric  fields  are

enhanced (Carslaw et al., 2002). The global circuit could therefore act to communicate 
cosmic ray changes throughout the atmosphere, by changes in the conduction current. 

3.2.2  Nuclear weapons testing 

increasing 

the  deposition  of  radioactivity,  greatly 

Large-scale changes in atmospheric ionisation occurred as a result of nuclear weapons 
tests  in  the  1950s  and  early  1960s,  and  radioactive  material  was  injected  into  the 
stratosphere. Surface PG values were dramatically reduced (Pierce, 1972). The surface 
changes  resulted  from 
the 
conductivity  and  reducing  the  PG  near  the  ground.  The  PG  was  reduced  to  less  than 
50V.m-1 in Scotland in 1963 (Pierce, 1972). Because of surface contamination at many 
sites,  it  is  unlikely  that  globally-valid  measurements  were  obtained  at  surface  stations 
during  that  period.  At  Lerwick,  where  a  surface  PG  reduction  was  recorded,  an 
accompanying feature was an increase in overcast days, found from examination of the 
routine solar radiation measurements (Harrison, 2002c). An anomaly in the solar diffuse 
and direct measurements was also found at Hohenpeißenberg Observatory in Germany 
by  Winkler  et  al.  (1998).  (Both  anomalies  occurred  before  the  1963  eruption  of 
Mt Agung.) If either anomaly was caused by the extra radioactivity in the atmosphere, it 
would  arguably  have  been  more  likely  to  be  caused  by  radioactive  ionisation,  rather 
than the supply of aerosol particles from the explosions. This is because the later tests 
were detonated well above the surface, to reduce the radioactive fallout generated, and 
therefore  produced  little  aerosol.  For  the  large  (megatonne)  nuclear  explosions 
occurring  at  that  time,  the  radioactivity  reached  the  stratosphere,  which  provided  a 
steady  supply  of  ionisation  to  the  troposphere.  With  further  analysis,  data  from  this 
period may provide additional evidence for tropospheric particle formation from ions. 

3.2.3  Atmospheric electricity and global temperature 
To  consider  the  relationship  between  the  DC  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  and  global 
temperature,  either  a  long  series  of  ionospheric  potential  measurements  or  a 
reconstruction of the global circuit as indicated in Section 3.1 is required. In the absence 
of  either,  existing  records  can  therefore  be  only  partially  analysed.  Section  3.1.1 
indicated a basis on which global measurements could be selected. Figure 11(a) shows 
PG variations found on the basis of diurnal cycle selection, followed by comparison of 
the mean values resulting with variations at other sites. It shows the average December 
PG  at  three  European  measurement  sites:  Lerwick  (Shetland),  Eskdalemuir  (Scotland) 
and Mt Wank (Bavaria) during the 1970s. December is common to both the UK sites as 
a month having a large positive correlation with the Carnegie curve, and the values used 
in computing the averages for Mt Wank were selected from days on which the hourly 
correlation with the Carnegie curve was greater than 0.8. There is a common minimum 
to  all  three  sites  in  December  1978,  which  supports  the  data  selection  approach. 
Additionally, Lerwick and Mt Wank show a short decline from 1980 followed by a rise 
in 1983 (Harrison, 2004b). 
 
Figure  11  (b)  shows  the  variation  in  monthly  average  temperatures  for  the  same 
Decembers  as  in  Figure  11  (a),  using  global  temperature,  northern  hemisphere 
temperatures  and  southern  hemisphere  temperatures  from  land-based  meteorological 
stations (Peterson and Vose, 1997). Although this is only a short period of data, there is 
a positive correlation between the PG and southern hemisphere temperature for the two 
UK  sites,  particularly  Lerwick.  This  is  physically  reasonable,  as  the  southern 

 

23

GEOP220 

hemisphere  lightning  approaches  its  seasonal  maximum  in  December,  contributing  a 
greater lightning flash rate than the northern hemisphere (Figure 8a ). 
 

3.2.4  Effects of global temperature on lightning and the global circuit 
A sharply non-linear relationship has been found between lightning flash rate and (wet 
bulb) temperature (Williams, 1994, 1999), related to the suggestion that local and global 
temperatures  could  be  monitored  sensitively  by  monitoring  lightning  and  the  global 
circuit  (Williams,  1992;  Price,  1993).  Schumann  resonance  observations  also  show  a 
strong  correlation  with  upper  troposphere  water  vapour  (Price,  2000),  further 
emphasising  the  surface  temperature-dependence  of  thunderstorms,  and,  possibly, 
electrified shower clouds. 
 
Price  (1993)  predicted  that  a  1%  (~3K)  increase  in  global  surface  temperatures  could 
result in a 20% (~50kV) increase in ionospheric potential. Subsequent work by Markson 
and Price (1999) also found a positive correlation between VI and global temperature, as 
derived  by  satellites.  Figure  11  (  c)  accordingly  shows  annual  temperatures  and  the 
annual  average  ionospheric  potential  when  available  (Markson,  1985).  There  is 
qualitative  agreement  between  the  Lerwick  December  average  PG  and  the  annual  VI 
(Harrison,  2004a)  indicating  that  the  values  are  showing  the  global  circuit  variations, 
but  a  relationship  between  VI  and  annual  average  temperature  anomalies  is  not  so 
apparent. In part, this may be due to the different importance of different regions on the 
electrified  shower  clouds  and  thunderstorms  not  captured  by  the  temperature 
measurements,  or,  more  probably,  the  poor  sampling  of  VI  temporally.  Corrections  to 
the VI measurements, to allow for differences in the diurnal temperature cycles and the 
diurnal charge production cycles, have been proposed. From these it has been concluded 
that VI is controlled by continental temperatures (Markson, 2003). 
 

3.3  Cosmic rays and cloud variations 
A remaining source of electrical changes in the atmosphere arises from the modulation 
in  ion  production  by  cosmic  rays  (see  also  Section  3.1.2).  Following  the  early 
suggestion  of  Ney  (1959),  studies  have  sought  to  link  changes  in  cosmic  rays  with 
atmospheric  parameters,  such  as  clouds.  The  cosmic  ray  data  from  the  University  of 
Chicago’s neutron counter at Climax and other stations are widely available. 

3.3.1  Surface cloud observations and transient cosmic ray changes  
Pudovkin and Veretenko (1995) reported high latitude surface cloudiness observations. 
They  found  a  short-term  decrease  in  high  cloud  (cirrus)  arising  from  short  periods  of 
reduced cosmic rays (“Forbush Decreases” which are due to increases in the solar wind) 
using  superposed  epoch  analysis.  The  work  assumed  that  the  cloud  observations  were 
weighted towards high clouds. 

3.3.2  Satellite observations and solar cycle cosmic ray changes 
As  indicated  in  Section  1.1,  area-averaging  is  likely  to  be  necessary  to  reduce  the 
natural  variability  in  the  atmosphere  sufficiently  for  atmospheric  electrical  effects  to 
emerge. An analysis by Marsh and Svensmark (2000), shows that cosmic rays and low 
(i.e.  with  altitudes  less  than  about  3  km)  clouds  observed  by  global  satellites  are 

 

24

GEOP220 

strongly  correlated  around  the  cosmic  ray  minimum  of  1990.  The  correlation  was 
originally  presented  in  1997  (Svensmark  and  Friis-Christensen,  1997)  and  the 
limitations  of  the  data  analysis  and  acquisition  have  been  the  subject  of  considerable 
discussion (Kernthaler et al., 1999; Kristjánsson and Kristiansen, 2000). The cloud data 
used  was  the  D2  dataset  of  the  International  Satellite  Cloud  Climatology  Project 
(ISCCP) (Rossow and Schiffer, 1991), which uses algorithms to identify high cloud (at 
heights with equivalent pressures of 50-440hPa) and low cloud (680-1000hPa). There is 
no correlation with high clouds (Kristjánsson and Kristiansen, 2000). In the North and 
South  Atlantic  areas,  where  cosmic  ray  correlations  were  found,  Sun  and 
Bradley (2002)  again  report  the  greatest  effect  in  low  clouds.  A  explanation  for  a 
differential  cosmic  ray  effect  on  low  and  high  clouds  has  been  given  in  terms  of  ion-
induced  particle  production  by  Yu (2002).  Yu (2002)  argues  that  the  recombination 
rates of ions are proportional to their concentrations, therefore the ion lifetime is greater 
at lower altitudes, where the ionisation rate from cosmic rays is smaller. More particles 
suitable  as  cloud  condensation  nuclei  would  therefore  be  formed  in  the  lower 
atmosphere. 
 

3.3.3  Evidence from past climates 
On very much longer timescales, extending back 500 million years, Shaviv and Veizer 
(2003)  have  reported  a  negative  correlation  between  cosmic  rays  and  global 
temperature, for cosmic ray changes generated by the solar system passing through the 
spiral arms of the galaxy. A similar mechanism to that of Marsh and Svensmark (2000), 
ion-induced  CCN  formation,  has  been  suggested  to  explain  the  finding,  in  which  the 
CCN  lead  to  more  cloudiness,  reduced  insolation  and  lower  temperatures.  Long 
timescale changes in atmospheric composition and the geomagnetic field may, however, 
invalidate the connection.  
 

4  Conclusions 
The  atmospheric  electrical  circuit  has  probably  not  remained  constant  over  time.  Its 
long-term  variations  have  only  recently  begun  to  be  considered  and  present  a  new 
research field to atmospheric science (Harrison, 1997c). Associated with this is the need 
to assess the importance of global electrical changes in providing a physical mechanism 
for  amplifying  the  small  changes  associated  with  solar  variability  to  give  larger 
atmospheric  and  climate  effects.  Physically-plausible  mechanisms  linking  cloud 
processes with the background electrical properties have been identified in recent work 
(Carslaw  et  al.,  2002),  but  the  theoretical  models  from  which  the  magnitudes  of  the 
effects concerned can be calculated are only at an early stage. Indications in several data 
sets suggest that variations in cosmic rays, clouds, the atmospheric electric circuit and 
global  temperature,  show  at  points,  close  relationships.  Currently  these  can  be  only 
partially explained and theory is required if the statistical relationships found are to be 
understood  physically.  Figure  12  presents  a  summary  of  the  global  circuit  and  global 
climate interactions discussed in the paper. 
 
Further  progress  requires  the  integration  of  different  areas  of  geophysics,  which,  in 
many cases, are individually relatively well understood. Taken together, however, a new 

 

25

GEOP220 

synthesis of cloud, climate and aerosol physics, atmospheric electricity and atmospheric 
physics is necessary. Areas which appear particularly fruitful to consider are: 
 

•  Reconstruction of past changes in the atmospheric electrical circuit on monthly, 
annual  and  decadal  timescales,  for  comparison  with  global  parameters  such  as 
global temperatures, cosmic rays and cloud amounts. 

•  Measurements or modelled distributions of the spatial and temporal changes in 
ionisation  (especially  from  cosmic  rays)  in  the  cloud-forming  regions  of  the 
atmosphere,  for  comparison  of  cloud,  ion  and  aerosol  properties  in  the  same 
regions. 

•  The  electrical  coupling  between  non-thunderstorm  clouds  and  the  background 
electric  field  needs  to  be  investigated  at  an  electromagnetic  level,  theoretically 
and experimentally. 

•  Research into the basic properties of the atmospheric electric circuit, in terms of 
its  time  response  to  transient  events  in  ionisation  (e.g.,  from  nuclear  weapons 
tests and sudden cosmic ray decreases). 

 
There is actually a considerable quantity of disparate surface atmospheric electrical data 
available,  together  with  occasional  aircraft  and  balloon  campaigns.  A  problem  is  that 
these  measurements  are  in  different  archives  and  libraries,  and  very  few  are  available 
digitally.  The  data  need  to  be  combined  to  facilitate  further  analysis.  Satellite  cloud 
measurements  provide  high  quality  measurements  of  cloud  abundance  and  type. 
Integrating satellite and atmospheric electrical data is an essential step in quantifying the 
electrical  influences:  however,  the  meteorological  variability  in  the  climate  system  
complicates  the  extraction  of  small  signals,  such  as  those  associated  with  solar 
variability.  This  may  be  especially  true  if  the  timescales  of  ion-induced  aerosol  and 
cloud  formation  are  comparable  with  the  typical  timescales  of  atmospheric  changes 
associated  with  weather  systems,  as  seems  likely.  Constructing  a  numerical  model  of 
cloud  microphysics,  including  the  electrical  interactions  of  aerosols,  ions  and  water 
droplets  in  stratiform  clouds  presents  one  example  of  a  quantifiable  approach. 
Reconstruction using proxies for past atmospheric electrical changes are likely to prove 
highly valuable, but extension of the basic measurements of atmospheric electricity to 
the global scale for comparison is also essential. 
 
Despite  the  difficulty  in  identifying  cause  and  effect  in  a  chaotic  system  such  as  the 
atmosphere, it remains possible that the global atmospheric electrical circuit provides a 
neglected  feedback  in  the  climate  system,  and  with  it,  an  amplification  of  the  solar 
variability signal in the climate records. This is the principal reason why the topic now 
deserves further exploration.

Figure captions : The global atmospheric electrical system and climate 

Figure  1.  Overview  of  the  processes  considered  in  this  paper,  which  link  the  global 
atmospheric electrical system with climate. Solid arrows indicate flows of energy (thin 
lines)  or  charge  (thick  lines).  Dashed  arrows  indicate  suggested  influences  and  solid 
arrows established physical mechanisms. 

Figure  2.  Diurnal  variation  in  Potential  Gradient  measured  by  Simpson  (1906)  at 
Karasjok,  Lapland,  between  1903  and  1904.  The  diurnal  variation  shows  a  minimum 
before dawn and a maximum in the early evening. The amplitude of the diurnal cycle is 
greatest in winter and smallest in summer. 

Figure 3. Principles of early apparatus for surface atmospheric electrical measurements. 
(a)  Potential  Gradient  (PG).  A  well-insulated  collector  (radioactive  probe,  passive 
sensor,  flame  or  water  dropper)  is  positioned  at  a  height  z  and  allowed  to  acquire  the 
atmospheric  potential  V0.  The  potential  of  the  collector  is  measured,  relative  to  the 
surface, using an ultra-high impedance electrometer voltmeter. The potential gradient is 
found  by  a  correction  to  V0/z.  (b)  Air  conductivity.  Air  conductivity  may  be  found 
using a  cylindrical capacitor or Gerdien tube, through which air is drawn past a well-
insulated  central  electrode.  A  bias  voltage  is  applied  between  the  electrodes,  and  the 
current of small ions passes between the electrodes is measured; this is proportional to 
the  air  conductivity.  (c)  Air-Earth  current.  Wilson's  apparatus  for  air-Earth  current 
consisted  of  a  portable  gold  leaf  electrometer,  connected  to  a  horizontal,  circular 
collecting  plate,  surrounded  by  an  earthed  guard  ring.  The  apparatus  also  included  a 
battery  and  a  variable  capacitor  (or  compensator),  by  which  the  potential  of  the 
collecting plate could be changed, and a brass cover for the collecting plate. The rate of 
change in plate potential was used to determine the air-Earth current. 

Figure  4.  (a)  Standard  diurnal  variation  in  Potential  Gradient  (Carnegie  curve)  and 
global  thunderstorm  area  (from  Israel,  1973).  (b)  Carnegie  curve  Potential  Gradient 
(expressed as % of mean value in (a) ) plotted as a function of thunderstorm area. 

Figure 5 (a) Relative diurnal variation in Potential Gradient found by averaging hourly 
values from all fair weather days 1968-1971 at Lerwick, Shetland and the ionospheric 
potential  as  measured  by  Mühleisen  and  Fischer  at  Weissenau,  Germany,  with  25 
balloon ascents between 13 March 1968 and 24 June 1971. (Note that the time plotted is 
the launch time of the balloon sounding: this causes an offset in the cycle to appear.) 
The  standard  Carnegie  variation  is  also  shown.  (b)  Time  series  of  six-hourly  average 
values  of  PG  obtained  at  Eskdalemuir  and  on  the  Carnegie  (in  the  western  Atlantic), 
during  September  1928.  PG  measurements  from  Lerwick  for  the  same  period  are 
shown, and the hourly values from Carnegie on 15 September 1928 plotted. Reprinted 
from Harrison (2004a), with permission from Elsevier.

Central  Paris,  and  from  a  water  dropper  instrument  at  the  top  of  the  Eiffel  Tower

(data from Budyko, 1971). The PG at Lerwick, when available for synchronous hours 
with no hydrometeors, is also shown. 

Figure  8.  (a)  Seasonal  variation  in  total  lightning  flash  rate  obtained  by  smoothing 
(using a 55 day moving average to correct for the satellite orbital parameters) the annual 
climatology  from  NASA’s  Lightning  Imaging  Sensor  (LIS)  and  Optical  Transient 
Detector (OTD). (b) Relative Carnegie diurnal variation as for DJF (December-January-
Feburary),  MAM  (March-April-May),  JJA  (June-July-August)  and  SON  (September-
October-November).  (Data  from  Torreson,  1946,  with  hourly  values  >  250V/m 
excluded.) 

Figure 9. Summary of periods for which long-term surface data (mostly measurements 
of the Potential Gradient) are available, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Figure 10. (a) Potential Gradient measurements (expressed as % of the long-term mean 
for the months selected) from the three UK Observatories of Kew (June), Eskdalemuir 
(annual) and Lerwick (June-July-August) during the first half of the twentieth century. 
(b) Comparison between the Kew (June) and Eskdalemuir (annual) PG changes shown 
in (a) with the observed concentration of the cosmogenic isotope beryllium-10, as a % 
of the 1900-1950 mean. 

Figure 11. (a) Annual variations in the December average PG measured at Lerwick and 
Eskdalemuir (Harrison,  2004a) and Mt Wank in the Bavarian  Alps (Harrison, 2004b). 
(b) Global and hemispheric temperature anomalies (from Global Historical Climatology 
Network GCHN 1701-12/2001 for land-based surface stations, base period 1951-1980), 
also  for  December.  (c)  Annual  global  and  hemispheric  temperature  anomalies  (from 
GHCN 1701-12/2001 for land-based surface stations, base period 1951-1980) compared 
with annual averages of ionospheric potential measurements (Markson, 1985).

with  global  climate.  Thick  lines  indicate  established  links  and  thin  lines  indicate 
suggested links.

1 i.e. fair weather 
2 An early photograph survives (Hackmann, 1994) 
3 The PG is defined as +dV/dz, where V is the potential with respect to earth (at which 
V = 0) at a (positive) height z above the surface. The PG is positive above the surface in 
fair weather conditions: it is frequently negative in precipitation. 
4 A thunderday is a calendar day on which thunder is heard at a meteorological 
observing station.

Abstract

Wigner-type distributions have shown their effectiveness
in classification
problems of sonar and radar. We present an overview of applications where
resonance features in echoes scattered from targets insonified or illuminated with
short pulses are studied in the joint time-frequency domain. We first show the
acoustic case of an elastic shell with a few filler materials submerged in water and
insonified by the “clicks” dolphins generate when they are echo-locating the
targets to classify them. The second example deals with a ground-penetrating radar
used to identify buried land mines. We have compared the performance of various
time-frequency distributions as well as a technique combine these with a “fuzzy-
cluster” representation of the subsurface target signatures.

INTRODUCTION

The Wigner distribution (WD), which has received considerable attention since its introduc-
tion in 1932 [1], is an excellent example of Wigner’s well-known statement about “the unreason-
able effectiveness of mathematics to describe the physical world.” This marriage of the ambigui-
ty function and the Fourier transform is today the foundation of the field of time-frequency (TF)
representations of signals. Moreover, it is particularly important in the area of target recognition.
Signals backscattered from targets are just more amenable to analysis and interpretation in the TF
domain. Of the various ways this can be done, it has been our observation that the WD and its
close relatives, such as the pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD), are excellent candidates to pursue
such active (or passive) classification tasks. In this work we show its effectiveness in
classification problems of sonar and radar. Resonance features in target echoes are well-known
entities to look for to identify unknown targets. These can be studied in either the frequency or
the time domains. However, a time-frequency distribution (TFD), which is a two-dimensional
function, can reveal the time-varying frequency content of one-dimensional signals. This proper-

ty of the TFDs is particularly useful for the extraction of signature features from (transient) target
echoes.

We first show the acoustic case of an elastic shell submerged in water and insonified by the
“clicks” dolphins use when echo-locating targets to classify them. We cannot enter the dolphin’s
brain, but we believe they use a TF approach to carry out their amazing feats. Anyway, we can, in
these examples, distinguish between the submerged targets using a PWD. The second example
deals with a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) used to identify buried land mines. Much effort has
been devoted to this case, theoretical and experimental. We have compared the performance of
various TF distributions as well as a technique to combine the PWD or any other time-frequency
distribution (TFD) with a “fuzzy-cluster” representation of subsurface target signature.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

1. TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS

In a wide variety of applications, bilinear TFDs are a primary signal analysis tool. Each one of
the large number of members in the general class (or Cohen class) of bilinear distributions [2,3]
that has been proposed can be interpreted as the two-dimensional Fourier transform of a
weighted version of the (symmetric) ambiguity function (AF) of the signal. These distributions
can all be written as

the distribution. Particular choices of the kernel function defines the various TFDs that have been

(CWD) is defined by the exponential kernel:
exp(
passes both auto- and cross-components from the AF into the TFD without attenuation. The
kernel of the CWD suppresses the cross-components at the expense of some smearing of the
auto-components [4], both to a degree that is controlled by the parameter s.

The degree of cross-terms interference that to some extent can be controlled in the CWD by

the WD. The resulting pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD) is then given by

The smaller the value of the parameter σ is chosen, the larger the amount of smoothing and
reduction of cross-terms interference. For a large value of σ the CWD approaches the WD. It
should be noted that cross-terms interference between different portions of a noise-free signal
backscattered from a target generates desirable signature features in the TFD, while cross-terms
interference associated with added noise gives rise to undesirable “artifacts” that tend to obscure
the target’s signature.

2. TARGET IDENTIFICATION USING RESONANCE FEATURES

The isolation and extraction of resonance features from sonar or radar cross-sections is done
because resonances serve to identify remote targets like their fingerprints. The spectral lines of a
the isolated resonances) can be viewed as a macroscopic
target and their widths (i.e.,
ω incident on an
spectroscopy scheme [5]. A long pressure pulse with fixed carrier frequency
ω , since long pulses have narrow
acoustic or elastic target will excite it near the frequency
ω is chosen to coincide with a natural resonance of the target, then the target

resonates at that frequency. If not, then no resonance feature will appear in the echo. Short pulses
that have broad spectra produce transient scattering effects over the frequency band of the
incident pulses. This can be used in impulse or ultra-wideband (UWB) sonar / radar. In the case
of sonar, if a is some characteristic length of the target, c the sound speed in the medium, and
is the wave number, then the far-field backscattered pressure returned by the target is

III. AN APPLICATION TO ACOUSTICS

1. ECHOES GENERATED BY THE DOLPHIN SONAR

Dolphins have an unsurpassed ability to identify underwater objects using their biological
sonar [8,9]. We have examined a large collection of sonar pings (“clicks”) emitted by trained
dolphins when they are attempting to insonify or “echo-locate” certain targets presented to them
by the trainers. The database also contains the backscattered echoes returned to the animal. The
experiments were conducted at the Navy NRaD (Hawaii) Laboratory. The experimental set-up
has been described elsewhere [10]. The dolphin, with his head in a hoop, was echo-locating on a
target placed in the water in front of him. The targets were cylindrical, aluminum shells
suspended vertically at a distance of about 4.5 m. The shells were filled with various substances
(glycerol, beeswax, or salt water), which the animal was supposed to distinguish. The animal
communicates to us his consistently correct choices by pushing an underwater paddle whenever
the “correct” target was presented to him. This correct target was the one he had been trained to
identify by means of standard conditioning techniques and food reinforcements. A recording
system captured all the clicks and the returned echoes. We compared recorded data with our
predictions for the same conditions, which showed good agreement. We also used inverse
scattering techniques that we have developed that allow the identification of the shell
characteristics from selected features in the echoes. There are several spectral features, and their
time-domain counterparts, that are observable in all responses. We have shown that humans can
extract the main geometrical and physical characteristics of the targets (i.e., shell shape, size,
material composition of the shell and its filler, etc.) from these features. Hence, since these clues

4

are also available to the dolphin, we would like to believe, that this is the simple procedure the
dolphins use to carry out their amazing identification feats. Basic properties of the incident clicks
that best bring out the above-mentioned identifying features in the echo are that the pulses are
short (i.e., broadband), of suitable frequency content to match the size of the target, and energetic
enough (i.e., of high S/N) to overcome the ambient noise levels that may be present.

2. TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS TO IDENTIFY DOLPHIN INSONIFIED

TARGETS

Figure 1 displays the 3-D plots of the modulus of the PWD as obtained from Eq. (2.3) with a
narrow time window. Figure 1, left (or right) plot corresponds to the theoretically predicted (or
measured) backscattered echoes from the shell [11]. In this case the shell is filled with glycerol.
The figures also show the 2-D projection in the bottom time-frequency plane, as well as the
returned waveform and its spectrum on the lateral planes. Using Eq. (2.6), the theoretical
prediction of the returned echo is computed for a cylindrical shell of infinite length but with the
same radial dimensions and the same material as the shells used in the experiments. Here, the
actual dolphin click is made to insonify the shell. The large “mountain” in each PWD plot
exhibits great resemblance. That feature is mainly generated by the specular return, and it shows
the broad bandwidth of the dolphin’s click. The information contained within this frequency
band of backscattered echoes (the specularly returned portion of the echoes and the possible
subsequent ringing) is sufficient for the dolphin’s successful target identification. Figure 2, left
(or right) plots display the corresponding measured response when the shell is filled with
beeswax (or salt water). Comparing the three measured PWDs of Figs. 1 and 2, a minimally
trained observer can distinguish between these three targets. A more detailed analysis of the
information about geometry and material composition of the shells and their filler material was
given elsewhere [10,11], and does not fit here.

distribution one wishes to use for the time-frequency analysis of the returned signals. As in the
examples to be shown below, we will use the PWD with a suitable Gaussian window. The width
of the window depends on the type of feature one wishes to emphasize. We have illustrated
elsewhere [12] how the amount of signature features can be controlled using windowing
technique. We will concentrate on scattering data obtained from objects buried underground and
illuminated with short pulses of a (broadband) ground-penetrating radar (GPR) [13]. This is
basically an ultra-wideband or
land-mine detection and, particularly,
classification.

2. INSTRUMENTATION AND ACCURACY OF MEASUREMENTS MADE WITH GPR

An impulse radar system was used to examine [14–17] ground penetration experiments when
several targets were buried in the sand of an indoor large sand container of length / width / depth,
5 / 5 / 2 m. The sand container is at the Linköping site of the Swedish Defense Research Agency
(FOI). The pulses transmitted by the impulse radar system were 0.3 ns in duration with a pulse-
repetition frequency of 250 kHz and a peak power of 50 W. Two different antenna units were
used both containing two broadband (200–2,000 MHz [14,15] or 200–3,000 MHz [16,17])
dipoles (transmitting and receiving), which are perpendicular. Data were sampled and pre-
processed using a digitizing signal analyzer with a resolution of 14 bits. The equivalent time-
sampling rate was chosen to be 20 GS/s (gigasamples per second). To use the system as a GPR
the antenna unit was mounted on a positioning system above the ground surface. The antenna

6

position was computer-controlled in three directions. The antenna was usually placed at a height
of 2 or 5 cm above the ground surface. The strong specular return from the ground surface is
suppressed using crossed dipoles, which also reduce echoes returned from many targets when the
antennas are kept right above the target. Whatever coupling was present was suppressed by
taking measurements with the antenna at a height of 70 cm above the ground (without any buried
target) and then subtracting the recorded time-series from each one of the time-series obtained
when a target was present. Ten sampled waveforms were ensemble averaged to suppress noise.

3. TIME-FREQUENCY SIGNATURES OF BURIED TARGETS

Given a simple target, it is of interest to examine its backscattered echoes using various time-
frequency distributions in an attempt to determine which one offers the most advantages for
classification. This is not an unambiguous task. In many instances two distributions can be
equally satisfactory, and in other instances, this may not be the case. To illustrate this point we
examine echoes from a metal sphere 10 cm in diameter buried in sand at a depth of either 5 cm or
15 cm. The test was conducted in the above-mentioned sandbox and with the center of the
antennas located at a small horizontal (i.e., about 20 cm) distance from the vertical symmetry
axis of the target. We have compared the echoes as plotted in the time-frequency domain by
means of many distributions listed elsewhere [2]. These include the PWD and CWD given by
Eqs.
the “cone-shaped
distribution” (CSD), the “Gabor spectrogram” (GS), and the “spectrogram” (SPEC). When
applied to returned echoes from objects illuminated by an impulse radar the PWD, CWD and AS
all have good resolution and features concentration, while simultaneously they all extract a
reasonable amount of features (depending on the time and frequency resolution). These were
found to best handle situations in which the target response is corrupted by clutter and multiple
scattering effects, which are always present when underground targets are considered. The other
distributions (i.e., CSD, GS and SPEC), all share the undesirable property of smearing out the
extracted features [15]. The PWD seems to be robust enough to retain the main features of the
target signature even when the burying depth is increased to 25 cm.

(2.3) and (2.4). Others were the “adaptive spectrogram” (AS),

at a depth of 5 cm.

Figure 3, left (or right) plot shows the PWD (or CWD) of the returned echo when a 10 cm
metal sphere buried at the depth of 5 cm is illuminated by a GPR. The plots also show the
waveform and its spectrum on the lateral planes. To appreciate the relative robustness of the
PWD and CWD we compare Fig. 3 with the corresponding results when the burying depth is
increased to 15 cm as shown in Fig. 4. Ideally, the time-frequency distributions in Fig. 4 should
occur at a later time that corresponds to the larger burying depth while their shape would be
retained. This is more or less the case, particularly when the echoes are analyzed using the PWD
(left plots). While the characteristic shape of the CWD is retained, the CWD seems nonetheless
to be more sensitive to the larger amount of clutter that is present at the 15 cm depth (right plots).
The analyzed waveform is the same for both time-frequency distributions in Figs. 3 and 4,
respectively. In view of its advantages we will use the PWD in the cases to follow in the next
sections.

at a depth of 15 cm.

4. FUZZY-CLUSTER REPRESENTATION OF TARGET SIGNATURES

Any PWD calculated using a discrete-time version of Eq. (2.3) is then known in a rectangular
grid defined by two integer coordinates [16,17]. Within each grid mesh the value of the PWD is
constant and, if smaller than a selected value, can be set equal to zero to suppress the influence of
signal noise or clutter. Each mesh with a nonzero value of the PWD is then represented by a
point that is being randomly allocated within the mesh and associated with a weight equal to the
value of the PWD. In this way we obtain a weighted point cluster representation of the PWD that
can be used in conjunction with a fuzzy classification model based on cluster estimation [18].
The “fuzzy C-means” (FCM) clustering algorithm, modified to account for the weight associated
with each cluster point, is then used to reduce the weighted point cluster representation of the
PWD to a much smaller number of “cluster centers.” The idea is that any set of points that are
distributed over a surface of finite extent can be represented by much smaller number of cluster

8

centers. In a “fuzzy” way these centers lie as close as possible to all the original given points.
This could be achieved by first introducing a cost function that is defined to be the sum of each
point’s squared distance to the most adjacent cluster center, and then adjusting the position of
each cluster center so as to minimize the cost function. All points that are closest to a given
cluster center form a subcluster where these points have unit membership. If the cost function is
modified by introducing a slightly different membership function that instead associates each
point with a partial membership of each cluster center, then we have the full concept of the fuzzy
C-means algorithm. The set of cluster centers computed using this algorithm is then a representa-
tion of the PWD that can be used as a template for target recognition purposes.

5. COMPARISON OF FUZZY-CLUSTER TEMPLATES WITH THE PWD

To illustrate the procedure [17], we consider five targets buried in the large sand container
described above, with the GPR antenna unit with crossed dipoles (200–3,000 MHz) at a height of
5 cm above the ground surface. The targets are: (A) a dummy mine filled with beeswax, of
diameter 8 cm and height 3.5 cm, (B) a dielectric nylon cylinder (diameter 25 cm and height 5
cm), (C) a metal sphere (diameter 10 cm), (D) a short metal cylinder (diameter 30 cm and height
5.5 cm), and (E) a stone the shape and size of a coconut. For each one of these targets, a total
number of 400 measurements were performed. To suppress noise, the time-series are each
composed of 10 ensemble averaged, or time-overlaid, sampled waveforms. The antenna center
was positioned at each point of a grid centered above the target consisting of 20 lines in both
directions with a 2 cm separation. The antenna elements made an angle of 45˚ with the grid lines.
The PWD is evaluated from the discrete counterpart of Eq. (2.3) for each one of the five targets
buried at 5 cm depth and illuminated by the GPR. The modified FCM algorithm is then used to
generate a set of cluster centers.

These plots show also the cluster centers, chosen to be five, that result from the application of the
FCM algorithm modified to take weighted cluster points into account. These templates are now
used for classification. For each recorded waveform returned from a target its PWD is computed.

clutter or signal contributions from multiple scattering. At each position of the template and
time-window the weighted cost function is computed. The system keeps track of the smallest
value and the template position where it occurred. This classifier does not utilize the strength of
the returned echoes. Only the shape and relative magnitude of the generated PWD are used here.

Figure 6. Classification results for target C (metal sphere).

Figure 6, left plot, displays the classification results of target C (i.e., the metal sphere), and we
note that it is correctly classified at all antenna positions except along the two crossing diagonals.
At these antenna positions, at least one of the antenna elements is reaching above the target’s
center and, because of the target’s symmetry, the returned echo from the target is weak. The right
plot of Fig. 6 displays the classifier’s second choice. Where the target is correctly classified, the
second choice is almost everywhere the other metal target (i.e., D, the short metal cylinder).
Similarly, Fig. 7 displays the classification results for target D. In this case the target is more
often misclassified as the other metal target (i.e., C). Hardly anywhere except close to the
crossing diagonals is any of these targets misclassified as one of the dielectric targets.
Conversely, the dielectric targets (i.e., A, B, and E) were most often classified as another
dielectric target when misclassified [17] (not shown here).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have shown how impulse sonars or radars are, or can be, used for target identification pur-
time-frequency domain. The
poses. We illustrated several useful approaches in the joint
identifying resonance features are best analyzed in the time-frequency domain using bilinear
distributions of the Wigner-type. A favorite one in this work was the pseudo-Wigner distribution
obtained by introducing a smooth time-window in the Wigner distribution. The extracted features
have been connected in many instances to actual physical characteristics of the targets. In the
present review we showed a sonar example in which we proposed and explained how these
techniques could elucidate the amazing classification feats performed by dolphins. We also
discussed the operation of an impulse radar functioning as a ground penetrating radar to identify
subsurface land mines.

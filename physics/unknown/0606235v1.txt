Abstract
—The effect of the strength of the focusing magnetic ﬁeld on chaotic dynamic processes occurring in
an electron beam with a virtual cathode, as well as on the processes whereby the structures form in the beam
and interact with each other, is studied by means of two-dimensional numerical simulations based on solving a
self-consistent set of Vlasov–Maxwell equations. It is shown that, as the focusing magnetic ﬁeld is decreased,
the dynamics of an electron beam with a virtual cathode becomes more complicated due to the formation and
interaction of spatiotemporal longitudinal and transverse structures in the interaction region of a vircator. The
optimum  efﬁciency  of  the  interaction  of  an  electron  beam  with  the  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  of  the  vircator  is
achieved at a comparatively weak external magnetic ﬁeld and is determined by the fundamentally two-dimen-
sional nature of the motion of the beam electrons near the virtual cathode.

1.  INTRODUCTION

Over the past three decades, considerable attention
has  been  given  to  physical  processes  occurring  in
charged particle beams with an overcritical current in
regimes of formation of a virtual cathode (VC) [1–6].

Numerous  experimental  and  theoretical  investiga-
tions  of  VC-based  devices  (which  are  usually  called
vircators  [7])  give  evidence  of  the  complicated
unsteady dynamics of radiation from beams with a VC
in such systems [3, 8–12]. In particular, such investiga-
tions revealed some regular features of the chaotic gen-
eration of radiation in vircators [5, 6, 12–17], provided
insight into the onset of spatiotemporal structures in an
electron beam and on their interaction with a VC [16–
21], and showed a close relationship between the com-
plication of the spectral content of radiation from a vir-
cator  and  the  formation  of  electron  structures  in  an
overcritical-current electron beam [16, 18–20, 22].

However, the main regular features of the compli-
cated  nonlinear  dynamic  processes  in  VC-based
devices  have  been  examined  primarily  by  using  one-
dimensional (1D) models of the electron beam dynam-
ics. In a number of papers (see, e.g., [15, 17, 20, 22]),
the electron beam was assumed to be fully magnetized,
so  transverse  electron  motions  were  ignored  and  the
beam motion was treated as one-dimensional. The self-
consistent  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  was  modeled  by
numerically solving Poisson’s equation (see, e.g., [15,
22, 23]) or Maxwell’s equations [17, 20].

Of course, the assumption of 1D motion of an elec-
tron beam in a vircator is valid only for a sufﬁciently
strong guiding magnetic ﬁeld, but this is not always the
case in a physical experiment. Moreover, a study was

f

also made of experimental models of a vircator without
an  external  focusing  magnetic  ﬁeld  [5,  9,  12,  24].  In
addition, the vircator radiation spectra calculated in 1D
models  are  in  rather  poor  agreement  with  the  data  of
physical experiments. In particular, it was shown exper-
imentally that the bandwidth of chaotic generation in a
vircator is 
 > 50% [12], and, in some experiments,
0
radiation was observed to be generated over more than
an octave bandwidth [25, 26]. It can be supposed that
this disagreement stems from the fact that, in 1D mod-
els, transverse electron motions in a beam focused by a
weak (but ﬁnite) magnetic ﬁeld are ignored. In [27, 28],
attempts were made to theoretically study the processes
in a beam with a VC by taking into account the ﬁnite
strength  of  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  that  focuses  the  beam
electrons.  However,  the  effect  of  the  strength  of  the
focusing magnetic ﬁeld on the nonlinear unsteady pro-
cesses that occur in an electron beam with an overcriti-
cal current has not yet been analyzed in detail.

In  this  paper,  we  present  the  results  of  numerical
investigations of the nonlinear unsteady dynamic pro-
cesses and structure formation in a relativistic electron
beam (REB) with a VC. The investigations were carried
out  based  on  a  2.5-dimensional  model  in  which  the
electron dynamics in the interaction space of the virca-
tor is described by a particle-in-cell (PIC) method [4,
29, 30] and the self-consistent electromagnetic ﬁeld is
determined  by  numerically  integrating  Maxwell’s
equations  in  two  dimensions  by  the  ﬁnite  difference
method.

We will consider the dynamics of an electron beam
in  the  actual  complicated  geometry  of  a  vircator  by
using  a  time-dependent  2.5-dimensional  model  based
on  solving  a  self-consistent  set  of  Vlasov–Maxwell
equations  [29,  32].  Note  that  such  models  are  now
being increasingly used in analyzing the physical pro-
cess in various microwave electronic devices [33].

In  a  strong  magnetic  ﬁeld  in  which  the  electron

The  oscillation  spectrum  has  a  pronounced,  predomi-
nating peak at a frequency of f ≈ 2.5(ω

At  weaker  guiding  magnetic  ﬁelds,  the  generation
process is more complicated: the oscillation spectrum
has additional frequency harmonics and a higher noisy
pedestal at a level from –30 to –20 dB (see Fig. 1b, cal-
culated for B = 20 kG). At weak ﬁelds B, the spectrum
has  not  only  high-frequency  (HF)  harmonics  at  3–6
GHz  but  also  low-frequency  (LF)  components  at  fre-
quencies f < 500 MHz (see Fig. 1c, calculated for B = 6
kG). In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, the oscillation
power spectrum in the frequency range 3.5–6 GHz is
continuous,  with  an  even  higher  noisy  pedestal  at  a
level of –10 dB (see Fig. 1d). The degree to which the
spectrum  is  irregular,  N  = Pmax/Pmin  (where  Pmax  and
Pmin  are  the  maximum  and  minimum  powers  of  the
spectral  harmonics  in  the  working  frequency  range),
does not exceed 3–10 dB.

In studying two-dimensional effects in the dynamics
of an electron beam with a VC, it is important to ana-
lyze  the  inﬂuence  of  the  current  distribution  in  the
injected  beam  on  the  current  jtr  that  is  transmitted
through  the VC  and  reaches  the  collector  end  of  the
interaction space, on the current jr that is reﬂected from
the VC back toward the injection plane, and on the cur-

rent jw to the side wall that bounds the drift space in the
transverse direction. Figure 2 shows the dependence of
the time-averaged currents jtr,  jr, and jw on the strength
B of the focusing magnetic field at a low and at a high
beam current. The currents jtr, jr, and jw are normalized
to the current of the injected beam. In Fig. 2, we also
show the gyrofrequency ω
c of the beam electrons in the
focusing magnetic ﬁeld. From Fig. 2 we can see that, at
strong focusing magnetic ﬁelds (B > 10 kG), the cur-
rents jtr and jr depend weakly on the ﬁeld strength. As B
is increased, the current jtr grows insigniﬁcantly and the
current jr falls off accordingly. In this range of B values,
the two-dimensional electron dynamics in a ﬁnite mag-
netic  ﬁeld  does  not  change  the  current  distribution  in
the system. As in the case of an inﬁnitely strong mag-
netic  ﬁeld  (when  the  electron  dynamic  is  inherently
one-dimensional), the injected electron beam in the VC
region  is  dynamically  distributed  into  two  streams—
one that is reﬂected from the VC back toward the injec-
tion plane and one that is transmitted through the VC
and reaches the collector.

Note  also  that,  at  strong  focusing  magnetic  ﬁelds,
the transmitted current jtr is close in magnitude to the
limiting vacuum current in the interaction space. This
result agrees well with the known experimental and the-

oretical data (see, e.g., [39, 40]), according to which the
current  transmitted  through  the  VC  should  be  very
close to the limiting vacuum current. The dependence
of the transmitted current on the injected beam current
at the magnetic ﬁeld B = 60 kG is presented in Fig. 2c.
We can see that, at low injected currents, the transmit-
ted current is lower than the limiting one. As the beam
current  is  increased,  the  transmitted  current  rapidly
approaches the limiting vacuum value. The dependence
of  the  transmitted  current  on  the  injected  current
requires further theoretical analysis. From Fig. 2c we
can  see  that,  at  weak  focusing  magnetic  ﬁelds,  the
transmitted current is lower than the limiting vacuum
current because some of the beam electrons escape to
the  side  wall  that  bounds  the  drift  space  in  the  trans-
verse  direction.  As  the  focusing  magnetic  ﬁeld  is
increased, the fraction of beam electrons that escape to
the side wall decreases and, accordingly, the transmit-
ted current approaches its limiting vacuum value.

At weak focusing magnetic ﬁelds, the beam dynam-
ics is radically different. The beam current begins to be
absorbed by the side wall of the working chamber of the
vircator at magnetic ﬁelds as weak as B < 5–10 kG, and
the absorbed fraction of the beam current grows rapidly
as  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  decreased.  The  current  jw  is
maximum at B ~ 0–2 kG. At such magnetic ﬁelds, the
current escaping from the system through the injection
plane is very low. An analysis of the electron trajecto-
ries shows that the beam electrons absorbed at the side
wall are mostly those that have been reﬂected from the
VC. The magnetic ﬁeld Bw at which the beam electrons
begin to be absorbed by the side wall can be regarded
as  a  critical  ﬁeld  strength  at  which  two-dimensional
effects  begin  to  considerably  affect  the  space  charge
dynamics. It is in the magnetic ﬁeld range B < Bw that
the multifrequency chaotic signal from the vircator is
observed to be generated over a substantially broader
frequency band.

Hence, as the focusing magnetic ﬁeld is decreased
while  the  beam  current  is  held  ﬁxed,  the  frequency
spectrum  generated  in  a  system  with  a  VC  becomes
progressively more complicated: it changes from a sin-
gle-frequency spectrum, when the electron dynamics is
essentially  one-dimensional,  to  the  broadband  spec-
trum of multifrequency chaotic oscillations, when the
beam dynamics is inherently two-dimensional and the
electrons are observed to be absorbed at the side wall.

The general conclusion of this section is as follows.
As  the  guiding  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  decreased  (and,
accordingly, as the two-dimensional electron dynamics
exerts a progressively greater effect on the oscillations
generated in a system with a VC), the output radiation
spectrum becomes more complicated. In this context,
an important practical task is to examine how the efﬁ-
ciency of a VC-based system depends on the strength of
the guiding magnetic ﬁeld.

interaction space, and M is the total number of charged
particles that have escaped from the interaction space.
Figure  3  illustrates  how  interaction  efﬁciency  (8)
depends  on  the  strength  B  of  the  focusing  magnetic
ﬁeld for different ratios of the beam current to the lim-
iting vacuum current I0 (above which an unsteady VC
forms in the system). We can see that, for each value of
the  beam  current,  there  exists  an  optimum  magnetic
ﬁeld strength Bopt at which the interaction efﬁciency is
highest.  The  optimum  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  weak,  Bopt  (cid:2)
10 kG,  and  increases  with  the  beam  current.  For
instance, for I ≈ I0, we have Bopt ≈ 0, whereas, for I = 4I0,
the optimum magnetic ﬁeld is as strong as Bopt ≈ 9 kG.
For the beam parameters considered in this section, the
maximum vircator efﬁciency is about η ~ 0.06.

When  the  guiding  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  changed  with
respect  to  its  optimum  strength,  the  efﬁciency  of  the
interaction  of  a  beam  with  an  electromagnetic  ﬁeld
decreases  abruptly.  In  the  range  of  strong  magnetic
ﬁelds, B > 20 kG, the interaction efﬁciency varies only
slightly and does not exceed values of η ~ 0.01–0.02,
depending on the relative beam current I/I0.

The above theoretical formulas for the dependence
of the generation efﬁciency of a vircator on the strength
of the guiding magnetic ﬁeld agree well with the exper-
imental data known from the literature. Davis et al. [31]
revealed  experimentally  that  an  optimum  magnetic
ﬁeld (of comparatively low strength) at which the gen-
eration  power  in  a  VC-based  system  is  highest  does
indeed exist, but no physical explanation was offered.
Note that formula (7) for the efﬁciency of the inter-
action of a beam with a ﬁeld in a vircator accounts for
only the energy of the electrons that are injected into the
interaction  space  and  escape  from  it.  In  a  number  of

papers (see, e.g., [12, 22]), it was shown that, in some
of the operating modes of a vircator, the metastable par-
ticles  that  remain  in  the  interaction  space  for  a  long
time (much longer than the oscillation period in the sys-
tem) begin to play an important role in the dynamics of
the  VC.  In  this  case,  formula  (7)  should  be  supple-
mented with a term that takes into account the energy
of  the  charged  particles  that  remain  in  the  working
chamber. With formula (7) so reﬁned, we calculated the
interaction efﬁciency for the beam current I = 1.5I0. For
an optimum magnetic ﬁeld B, the reﬁned efﬁciency was
 = 0.068, whereas the efﬁciency cal-
calculated to be 
culated for the same magnetic ﬁeld but without allow-
ance for the metastable particles was found to be equal
to η = 0.063. In other words, when the metastable par-
ticles remaining in the working chamber are taken into
account, the interaction efﬁciency increases by a rela-
tive amount of about δ = |
 – η|/η ≈ 0.08. As the ﬁeld
η
B is increased, the value of δ decreases; for strong mag-
netic ﬁelds (B > 20 kG), the calculated value of the efﬁ-
ciency is independent of whether the metastable parti-
cles are taken into account or not.

η

Such  a  dependence  of  the  parameter  δ  on  the
strength of the focusing magnetic ﬁeld shows that the
number of metastable particles increases substantially
as the ﬁeld is reduced. On the other hand, the effects
associated with metastable particles do not appreciably
change  the  value  of  the  interaction  efﬁciency;  they
merely introduce corrections to the results of calcula-
tions based on formula (7) or (8). How the number of
metastable  particles  in  the  working  chamber  depends
on the magnetic ﬁeld strength will be discussed in more
detail in the next section.

Let us now consider the reasons for such a depen-
dence of the interaction efﬁciency on the strength of the
focusing  magnetic  ﬁeld.  To  do  this,  we  analyze  the

toward the VC (their velocity is positive, vz > 0) and the
electrons the are reﬂected from the VC back toward the
injection plane (their velocity is negative, vz < 0). The
ﬁrst group of beam electrons (namely, the electrons that
are injected into the interaction space) is decelerated by
the electric ﬁeld Ez of the potential barrier of the VC;
the velocity of these electrons decreases and they trans-
fer their energy to the HF ﬁeld. In contrast, the second
group  of  electrons  (namely,  the  reﬂected  electrons)
escapes from the VC region and is accelerated by the
same ﬁeld Ez, so the electrons take energy from the HF
ﬁeld.  In  this  case,  the  ﬁeld  Ez,  which  decelerates  the
injected  electrons  and  simultaneously  accelerates  the
reﬂected electrons (whose velocity is negative, vz < 0)
is a function of the radial position r and has a maximum
at a radius rb equal to the radius of the injected beam,
maxEz(r) = Ez(r = rb). For r > rb and r < rb, the electric
ﬁeld strength is a rapidly decreasing function. This is
demonstrated in Fig. 4, which shows a qualitative char-
acteristic  proﬁle  of  the  electric  ﬁeld  Ez  in  the  radial
direction  r  within  the  VC  region  in  the  interaction
space. The shape of the proﬁle Ez(r) is essentially the
same for a strong and a weak guiding magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 4 also qualitatively illustrates the character-
istic features of the electron dynamics in the VC region
at  a  strong  (top)  a  weak  (bottom)  focusing  magnetic
ﬁeld.  In  the  coordinate  plane  (r,  z),  the  black  heavy
arrows show typical electron trajectories of the injected
electron beam, which is decelerated by the electric ﬁeld
Ez.  The  gray  arrows  show  typical  trajectories  of  the
electrons  that  are  reﬂected  from  the VC  and,  accord-

ingly, are accelerated by the ﬁeld Ez. In a strong guiding
magnetic ﬁeld, the electron beam reﬂected from the VC
has the same radius as the injected electron beam. Con-
sequently,  the  reﬂected  electrons  are  affected  by  the
electric ﬁeld that has the same amplitude as that inﬂu-
encing the injected electrons. As such, the energy trans-
ferred from the injected beam electrons to the HF ﬁeld
during their deceleration is close to the energy acquired
by  the  reﬂected  electrons  in  their  acceleration.  The
result is that the interaction efﬁciency (and accordingly,
the radiation power) turns out to be very low, η ~ 0.01–
0.02.1 

In a weak magnetic ﬁeld, the situation is quite dif-
ferent. Since the reﬂected beam is focused only slightly,
it can return to the injection plane along a trajectory dif-
ferent from that of the injected beam. The lower sketch
in Fig. 4 qualitatively illustrates the characteristic tra-
jectories of the reﬂected electrons in a weak magnetic
ﬁeld B. It is clearly seen that, since the reﬂected elec-
trons  move  along  trajectories  other  than  those  of  the
injected electrons, they experience an accelerating ﬁeld
that  is  weaker  than  the  decelerating  electric  ﬁeld.
Therefore,  the  energy  the  accelerated  reﬂected  elec-
trons  take  from  the  HF  ﬁeld  is  lower  than  that  trans-
ferred  from  the  injected  electrons  to  the  ﬁeld.  As  a
result, as the focusing magnetic ﬁeld is decreased, the
interaction  efﬁciency  increases  and,  at  an  optimum
magnetic ﬁeld, becomes as high as η ~ 0.06.

Note that, at a ﬁxed energy of the injected electron
beam, the higher the injection current and, accordingly,
the greater the space charge, the stronger the defocus-
ing  effect  of  the  latter.  Consequently,  as  the  injection
current is increased, the optimum magnetic ﬁeld should
also be raised in order for the conditions for the interac-
tion of a beam with the ﬁeld to be as efﬁcient as possi-
ble (see Fig. 4).

Let us now consider the quantitative parameters of
the beam dynamics in the VC region. Figure 5 presents
radial proﬁles of the longitudinal electric ﬁeld, the elec-
tron beam space charge density, the space charge den-
sity of the electrons moving toward the VC region, and
the space charge density of the electrons reﬂected from
the VC.  The  proﬁles  were  obtained  from  simulations
carried out for both weak and strong guiding magnetic
ﬁelds  and  refer  to  different  cross  sections  of  the  drift
space in the region between the injection plane and the
VC.

An analysis of the proﬁles in different cross sections
z of the interaction space shows that, at a strong focus-
ing magnetic ﬁeld, the space charge density of the beam
electrons  reﬂected  from  the  VC  is  maximum  in  the
same region as that of the beam injected into the inter-

1 Note  that,  in  this  qualitative  analysis,  the  electrons  that  have
passed through the VC are ignored. Such electrons are also accel-
erated  and,  hence,  take  energy  from  the  HF  ﬁeld.  But  the  total
number  of  them  is  much  less  than  the  number  of  electrons
reﬂected from the VC (see Fig. 2) and they can be ignored in a
qualitative analysis.

have been reﬂected from the VC and escape from the

ence an accelerating electric ﬁeld of the same strength

reﬂected from the VC is maximum at a weaker longitu-
dinal electric ﬁeld. As a result, the energy the reﬂected
electrons take from the electromagnetic ﬁeld is lower
than that transferred from the injected beam to the ﬁeld
and,  accordingly,  the  interaction  efﬁciency  increases
substantially, from 0.01–0.02 to 0.06.

5.  INVESTIGATION  OF  THE  STRUCTURE 
FORMATION  PROCESSES  IN AN  REB

Here, we consider the physical processes whereby
the  chaotic  dynamics  in  an  electron  beam  with  a VC
becomes  more  complicated  as  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  is
decreased. It is known that one of the physical mecha-
nisms responsible for the complex beam dynamics in a
system  with  an  overcritical  current  is  associated  with
the formation and interaction of spatiotemporal struc-
tures in a beam with a VC. This is why it is very impor-
tant  to  study  the  dynamics  of  the  space  charge  of  an
electron beam with an overcritical current in the inter-
action  space  in  order  to  reveal  the  internal  structures
that govern the operating modes of a vircator system.
Investigation  of  the  structure  formation  processes
should  begin  with  the  singling  out  of  coherent  struc-
tures  that  indicate  the  presence  of  internal  motions
responsible for chaotization of the VC dynamics in the
system. In [22], it was proposed to single out the coher-
ent structures by a method based on the wavelet bico-
herence analysis of the spatiotemporal data. In this way,
coherent structures can be conveniently singled out by
using the Karunen–Loev (KL) orthogonal decomposi-
tion  of  the  spatiotemporal  data  [20].  The  problem  of
singling out the KL modes reduces to that of solving the
integral equation

is possible to choose a zero-mean set of spatiotemporal
distributions  of  any  physical  quantity  as  the  function
ξ(z, t). In our analysis, the function ξ(z, t) can be conve-
niently taken to be the beam current density jz(z, t). The
eigenvalue Λ
n is
proportional to the energy contained in this mode. The

In the situation in question, however, we deal with a
two-dimensional  electron  motion;  consequently,  it  is
convenient  to  single  out  “longitudinal”  and  “trans-
verse” structures in the beam separately. In the ﬁrst case
(the singling out of transverse structures, which charac-

In the case when longitudinal structures are singled out
(i.e., those that characterize the dynamics of the system
in  the  beam  propagation  direction),  the  kernel  of  the
equation has the form

,(
K z z'

)

=

1/T 1/R u z' r t

(13)

Here, u(z, r, t) is a zero-mean set of spatiotemporal data
(we used a set of values of the beam space charge den-
sity ρ(z, r, t) minus its mean value) and T is the time
interval over which the time averaging is performed. As
above,  the  energy  of  the  transverse  and  longitudinal
coherent  structures  is  determined  by  analyzing  the
eigenvalues corresponding to the KL modes in Eq. (9).
Figure 6 displays how the energy Wn (in percentage
terms) of ﬁve highest-energy transverse and longitudi-
nal coherent structures depends on the focusing mag-
netic ﬁeld strength (the gyrofrequency ω
c) for the beam
current I = 1.5I0. Note that, in all operating modes (from
modes with regular oscillations to those with a complex
chaotic  beam  dynamics),  the  number  n  of  coherent
structures whose energy exceeds 90% of the total oscil-
latory energy is n = 2–5.

At strong magnetic ﬁelds B, the energy of the oscil-
latory motion in the system is mostly concentrated in
two transverse and one longitudinal KL structures. As
the magnetic ﬁeld is decreased, new structures arise in
the system, with the result that the energy of the highest
energy structures decreases and the amount of energy in
the lowest modes with the numbers n = 2–5 grows. At a
weak  magnetic  ﬁeld  (B ~  0),  the  transverse  (radial)
dynamics of the system is dominated by the ﬁve lowest
modes, having nearly the same relative energy. This cir-
cumstance  provides  evidence  that  the  space  charge
dynamics  is  complicated  just  in  the  transverse  direc-
tion.  As  for  the  longitudinal  structures,  only  one  of
them,  namely,  the  main  structure  with  the  highest
energy W1, predominates even at a weak magnetic ﬁeld;
it is the structure that should be associated with the VC
dynamics.  This  result  agrees  well  with  the  results
obtained  in  [17]  in  analyzing  the  structure  formation
processes  in  an  electron  beam  with  a  VC  in  a  one-
dimensional model.

In  order  to  conﬁrm  the  relationship  between  the
complication  of  the  electron  beam  dynamics  and  the
dynamics of the structures, we calculated the distribu-
tions  Φ(τ)  of  charged  particles  over  their  residence
times in the interaction space. The results of these cal-
culations are illustrated in Fig. 7. From Fig. 7a we can
see  that,  for  a  strong  magnetic  ﬁeld,  the  distribution

function has one pronounced maximum (indicated by
the symbol TVC), which corresponds to the oscillation
period of the VC (at the fundamental frequency f = 1/T
in the power spectrum that was calculated for the same
values of the beam current and of the magnetic ﬁeld;
see  Fig.  1a).  We  can  conclude  that,  in  this  case,  the
beam dynamics is dominated by only one structure—
the VC,  so  a  vircator  system  operating  with  a  strong
focusing  magnetic  ﬁeld  generates  nearly  single-fre-
quency radiation. This conclusion is conﬁrmed by Fig.
8a, which shows conﬁgurational patterns of an electron
beam for the magnetic ﬁeld B = 40 kG. The points in the
patterns correspond to charged macroparticles used in
numerical  simulations.  From  the  conﬁgurational  pat-
tern in the (z, vz/c) coordinates in Fig. 8a, we can see
that the bulk of charged particles are reﬂected from the
same point x = x VC in the interaction space, i.e., from
the VC (shown by the vertical dashed line). The conﬁg-
urational  pattern  in  the  (z,  r)  coordinates  in  Fig.  8a

shows that the thickness of the wall of an electron beam
propagating  along  the  interaction  space  does  not
change.  Hence,  in  a  vircator  system  operating  with  a
strong guiding magnetic ﬁeld, only one electron struc-
ture (a VC) forms, which governs the dynamics of the
system in the longitudinal direction.

As the magnetic ﬁeld is decreased (see Figs. 7b, 7c),
the  distribution  function  Φ(τ)  becomes  more  compli-
cated  in  shape.  Now,  the  function  Φ(τ)  has  several
peaks, each corresponding to a different electron struc-

ture in the beam. An analysis of the conﬁgurational pat-
terns of an electron beam calculated for weak guiding
magnetic  ﬁelds  (see  Figs.  8b,  8c)  also  shows  that  the
electron dynamics in the VC region becomes far more
complicated.  First,  the  beam  becomes  substantially
wider in the transverse direction and, second, the zone
where the electrons are simultaneously reﬂected in the
interaction region also signiﬁcantly broadens. The lat-
ter  circumstance  indicates  that  the  electrons  are
reﬂected back toward the injection plane from several
different regions, i.e., that several VCs form in the sys-
tem. An analysis of the residence times of reﬂected par-
ticles shows that each of the peaks in the distribution
function  (see  Figs.  7b,  7c)  corresponds  to  a  different
characteristic reﬂection region, i.e., to “its own” VC. In
[17],  it  was  shown  that,  at  strong  focusing  magnetic

ﬁelds, the chaotization of the output radiation from the
vircator is due to the formation of several VCs in the
drift space. Each VC affects other VCs by the electrons
it reﬂects. As a consequence, several feedback circuits
form  in  the  system,  which  thus  complicate  the  space
charge dynamics of an electron beam with an overcrit-
ical  current. At  weak  magnetic  ﬁelds,  the  situation  is
analogous;  however,  in  this  case,  not  only  electron
structures (VCs) form in different cross sections along
the  interaction  space,  but  also  the  transverse  (radial)
dynamics of the space charge becomes rather compli-
cated. Hence, at weak guiding magnetic ﬁelds, the for-
mation and interaction of electron structures in a beam
with a VC substantially complicate the spectrum of the
output radiation from a vircator.

Note also that, as the magnetic ﬁeld is decreased, the
distribution function of charged particles over their res-
idence times in the interaction space acquires a maxi-
mum at long time scales (τ > 6 ns). This maximum is
produced by metastable particles that remain within the
VC region for a long time and that were discussed in
Section 4. A comparison between Fig. 7a, 7b, and 7c,
which  were  obtained  for  different  magnetic  ﬁeld
strengths B leads to the conclusion that the number of
metastable particles increases as the magnetic ﬁeld is
reduced  and  reaches  its  maximum  at  weak  focusing
magnetic  ﬁelds. This  conclusion  agrees  well  with  the
results of numerical simulations reported in Section 4.
At the end of this section, we can draw the following
conclusion:  the  physical  mechanism  whereby  the
dynamics of an electron beam with a VC becomes more
complicated  with  increasing  beam  current  or  with
decreasing guiding magnetic ﬁeld is the formation and
interaction of spatiotemporal structures in a beam with
a VC. However, this mechanism manifests itself differ-
ently in different particular situations. For instance, as
the guiding magnetic ﬁeld is decreased, the transverse
beam  dynamics  (two-dimensional  effects)  plays  the
main role: the transverse electron structures in a beam
with an overcritical current are the ﬁrst to form. As the
beam current is increased at a strong focusing magnetic
ﬁeld, the transverse beam dynamics plays a lesser role:
it  manifests  itself  in  the  onset  of  transverse  space
charge oscillations.

6.  CONCLUSIONS

In  this  paper,  we  have  described  the  results  of
numerical studies of the complex oscillatory processes
occurring in an REB at different strengths of the guid-
ing magnetic ﬁeld.

We have shown that, as the strength of the guiding
magnetic  ﬁeld  is  decreased,  the  dynamics  of  an  REB
with a VC in a vircator system becomes more compli-
cated. Our investigations demonstrate that the physical
mechanism whereby the beam dynamics becomes more
complicated  with  increasing  beam  current  or  with
decreasing guiding magnetic ﬁeld is the same: the for-
mation and interaction of spatiotemporal structures in a
beam with a VC. For instance, as the guiding magnetic
ﬁeld is decreased, the transverse beam dynamics (two-
dimensional effects) plays the main role: the transverse
electron structures in a beam with an overcritical cur-
rent  are  the  ﬁrst  to  form.  As  the  beam  current  is
increased at a strong focusing magnetic ﬁeld, the trans-
verse beam dynamics plays a lesser role: it manifests
itself  merely  in  the  onset  of  transverse  space  charge
oscillations.

We have also shown that the efﬁciency of the inter-
action  of  the  beam  electrons  with  an  electromagnetic
ﬁeld  is  very  sensitive  to  the  strength  of  the  external
magnetic ﬁeld. In a vircator system, the efﬁciency with
which an electron beam interacts with an electromag-

netic ﬁeld is optimum at comparatively weak focusing
magnetic  ﬁelds  and  is  determined  by  the  inherently
two-dimensional  motion  of  the  beam  electrons  in  the
VC region.

Abstract 

It  is  well  known  that  the  third-order  Lorentz-Dirac  equation  admits  ‘runaway’  solutions  wherein 

the energy of the particle grows without limit, even when there is no external force. These solutions can be 

denied  simply  on  physical  grounds,  and  on  the  basis  of  careful  analysis  of  the  correspondence  between 

classical  and  quantum  theory.  Nonetheless,  one  would  prefer  an  equation  that  did  not  admit  unphysical 

behavior at the outset. Such an equation - an integro-differential version of the Lorentz-Dirac equation – is 

currently available either in 1 dimension only, or in 3 dimensions only in the non-relativistic limit.  

It is shown herein how the Lorentz-Dirac equation may be integrated without approximation, and is 

thereby  converted  to  a  second-order  integro-differential  equation  in  3D  satisfying  the  above  requirement. 

I.E.,  as  a  result,  no  additional  constraints  on  the  solutions  are  required  because  runaway  solutions  are 

intrinsically absent. The derivation is placed within the historical context established by standard works on 

classical electrodynamics by Rohrlich, and by Jackson.  

Introduction 

The  Lorentz-Dirac  equation  (LDE)  describes  the  motion  of  a  classical  charged  particle  subject  to 

both an external force and self-interaction due to radiation. An undesirable characteristic is the prediction 

of an exponential (runaway) acceleration in the absence of an applied force. The source of the trouble may 

be traced to the third order derivative with respect to time. Since one would prefer a second order equation 

anyhow, a natural approach is to convert the original LDE into a second order equation by integrating over 

time.  At  the  same  time,  one  might  take  the  opportunity  to  eliminate  the  runaway  solution  by  a  suitable 

choice for the constant of integration. 

This is the method cited by Jackson [1], as it applies to a non-relativistic (and thereby linearized) 

version of the LDE. It is successful in that runaway solutions are absent. The same approach was employed 

by  Rohrlich  [2]  to  the  relativistic  LDE,  but  without  success;  his  resulting  equation  still  permits  runaway 

solutions. The attempt failed because he was unable to combine the acceleration and radiation parts (times 

an integrating factor) as a total differential in proper time. 

Jackson  and  Rohrlich  are  referred  to  herein  because  they  are  standard  texts  on  classical  theory. 

However, for an earlier review of the subject that is both lucid and thorough, the reader is referred to Erber 

[3]. The first appearance of the non-relativistic integro-differential form of the LDE is due to Haag [4], (and 

subsequently - in English - Plass [5]). 

It  has  been  shown  that  the  non-relativistic  integro-differential  form  of the LDE is the finite-point 

limit  of  a  finite-size  (non-relativistic)  model  of  the  electron  [6,  7,  8].  Since  the  latter  is  free  of  runaway 

solutions, this may be regarded as evidence in favor of the validity of the integro-differential form, over the 

original  LDE.  Also,  (very  importantly),  Sharp  [9]  has  shown  that  the  non-relativistic  integro-differential 

LDE  corresponds  to  the  quantum  theory  of  a  non-relativistic  charge  coupled  to  the  quantized 

electromagnetic  field  (neither  of  which,  therefore,  display  runaway  solutions).  Both  these  results  point  to 

the  need  for  a  relativistic  generalization  of  the  existing  non-relativistic  integro-differential  version  of  the 

LDE.

Barut [10] has proposed a method to eliminate both the runaway and pre-acceleration behavior of 

the LDE by making the Abraham vector disappear when the external field disappears. However, as pointed 

out  by  Blanco [11],  such  an  equation  is  essentially  quite  different  from  the  original  LDE.  Jimenez  and 

Hirsch  [12]  suggest  that  the  non-relativistic  LDE  be  supplemented  by  an  external,  stochastic, 

electromagnetic field, in the spirit of Stochastic Electrodynamics (see for instance [13])). This, they argue, 

has  the  effect  of  eliminating  the  undesirable  runaway  behavior  without  modification  of  the  LDE  (to  an 

integro-differential form). Their program, though promising, potentially suffers from an externally-induced 

runaway problem unless the stochastic field is band-limited (which would be similar to supposing a finite-

sized charge).

LDE is easily linearized [2]. With the substitution

(f = 0),  w  may increase without limit, since

 is a solution. This causes  dx dτ and γ to increase

without limit, giving rise to the interpretation that the particle has accelerated to the speed of light and has 

acquired  an  infinite  kinetic  energy.  The  reason  for  the  presence  of  such  solutions  may  be  traced  to  the 

intrinsically non-conservative nature of the equation of motion. It was conceived to account for losses due to 

radiation, but turns out to admit gains, presumably by the same mechanism. 

The non-relativistic integro-differential equation 

When the velocities are small compared to c, γ ≈ 1, dτ ≈ dt, and Eq. (1) becomes 

(This  non-relativistic  form  of  the  LDE  is  also  called  the  Abraham-Lorentz  equation.)  It  suffers  from  the 

same  runaway  solution  as  Eq. (2)  -  the  relativistic  one-dimensional  result  written  in  hyperbolic  co-

ordinates. The traditional remedy [1] is to replace Eq. (3) with the integro-differential equation

It is readily verified upon substitution that the x that solve this equation are a subset of those that solve 

Eq. (3). It is also clear that, provided f vanishes in the remote future, the acceleration also vanishes in the 

remote  future.  Not  only  does  this  prescription  eliminate  the  runaway  solution,  but  it  also  restores  the 

boundary  condition  requirements  to  those  of  a  second  order  differential  equation,  e.g.:  the  position  and 

velocity  are  given  at  some  time.  This  time  need  not  be  when  the  force  is  zero (i.e. the remote past or the 

remote  future);  it  may  be  any  time.  Though  the  runaway  behavior  is  tamed,  it  is  at  the  expense  of  an 

acausal connection between the applied force and the resulting acceleration. Specifically, it is seen from Eq. 

(4) that the acceleration depends on future forces (exhibits pre-acceleration). However, the temporal range, 

τ0, of that dependency, is such that pre-acceleration is too small to be observed on classical time scales. 

Rohrlich’s relativistic integro-differential equation 

It is carefully argued by Rohrlich [2] that runaway solutions must be denied by imposing a suitable 

constraint,  i.e.,  a  boundary  condition  on  the  acceleration.  In  this  paper,  we  will  be  content  with  the 

condition

since we require an acceptable prediction of future behavior based on some ‘initial’ condition, given at some 

nominal  but  finite  time.  With  the  aim  of  integrating  the  constraint  into  the  equation  of  motion,  Rohrlich 

investigates a formal integration of Eq. (1),

where Aµ is a 4-vector constant of integration. He sets Aµ = 0, and considers the new equation as a possible 

replacement for Eq. (1). However, as he points out, setting Aµ to zero guarantees only that

which, clearly, is weaker than the requirement that the acceleration vanish, Eq. (5). Therefore we conclude 

that Eq. (6) with Aµ = 0 is unsatisfactory, since a supplemental constraint must still be imposed to filter out 

the unphysical behavior. 

An integrating factor for the Lorentz-Dirac equation 

A  fully  relativistic  integro-differential  form  of  the  Lorentz-Dirac  equation  that  does  not  admit 

runaway  solutions  (and  therefore  does  not  require  supplemental  constraints)  is  possible  if  a  suitable

will  permit  -  via  the  integration  of  Eq.  (7)  –  the  imposition  of  boundary  conditions  Eq. (5)  on  the 

acceleration. For this integrating factor to exist, by carrying out the differentiation in Eq. (7) and comparing 

with Eq. (1) left multiplied by S, it must be true that 

where none of the elements of S can depend on the acceleration a. A substitution into Eq. (8) of

There  are  only  three  independent  equations  in  Eq.  (1)  because  the  product  of  both  sides  with  the  four-

velocity is identically zero. As a consequence, for any

and  so  cannot  be  a  candidate  for  the  integrating  factor.  It  follows  that  R  cannot  have  a  unique  solution, 

since any candidate solution  R

R does not behave like a tensor under boosts, and is therefore not a Lorentz tensor. However, it does behave 

like a tensor under spatial rotations and space and time translations, and is therefore a Euclidean tensor. 

Nonetheless,  the  Lorentz  invariance  of  the  Lorentz-Dirac  equation  is  preserved.  This  can  be  seen  more 

readily if Eq. (13) is written as

 be a true 4-

be confirmed using Eqs. (11) and (14).

vanished - is zero. With a(τc) = 0, Eq. (16) becomes

which may be recognized as a relativistic version of the non-relativistic form, Eq. (4). It is easily seen that, 

having isolated the second derivative on the left hand side, the acceleration is guaranteed to vanish in the 

remote future if the force also vanishes then. Therefore, the solution is evidently free of runaways. Further, 

it  is  evident  that  solutions  of  this  equation  are  a  subset  of  the  solutions  of  the  original  Lorentz-Dirac 

equation,  Eq.  (1).  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  integro-differential  equation  Eq.  (18)  is  the 

physically correct equation of motion for a classical charged particle; it retains the properties of the original 

Lorentz-Dirac equation without the unphysical behavior. 

Since it is not immediately evident from Eq. (18), we here confirm that, as required, the acceleration 

is orthogonal to the velocity. Taking the 4-vector product of Eq. (18) with the velocity gives

Ordinary-time series expansion in ττττ0

Summary 

A  physically  acceptable  relativistic  equation  of  motion  for  a  classical  charged  particle  in  3  spatial 

dimensions  has  been  derived  that  has  the  properties  desired  of  the  original  Lorentz-Dirac  equation,  but 

without  the  unphysical  behavior.  The  exclusion  of  runaway  solutions  has  been  achieved  by  finding  an 

integrating  factor  for  the  original  Lorentz-Dirac  equation  so  that  the  acceleration  can  be  written  as  an 

integral operator on the force.

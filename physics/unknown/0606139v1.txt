Abstract 

The  question  of  how  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  compares  with  Hartree-Fock 

(HF) for the computation of  momentum-space properties is addressed in relation to systems 

for which (near) exact Kohn-Sham (KS) and HF one-electron matrices are known. This makes 

it possible to objectively compare HF and exact KS and hence to assess the potential of DFT 

for momentum space studies. The systems considered are the Moshinsky atom, the Hooke’s 

atom  and  light  two-electron  ions,  for  which  expressions  for  correlated  density-matrices  or 

momentum  densities  have  been  derived  in  closed-form.  The  results  obtained  show  that  it  is 

necessary to make a distinction between true and approximate DFT. 

Keywords: Momentum space, one-electron reduced density-matrix, two-electron atoms, DFT, HF.

Introduction 

1.1 Momentum-space experiments 

Compton  scattering  and  positron  annihilation  provide  information  complementary  to 

X-ray  or  neutron  diffraction,  making  it  possible  to  investigate  momentum-space  electron 

properties of a variety of systems. In particular, X-ray Compton scattering experiments allows 

for probing the ground-state electronic structure of materials. A Compton scattered radiation 

undergoes  a  Doppler  broadening  due  to  the  motion  of  electrons  in  the  target  material.  The 

broadened signal, i.e. proportional to the directional Compton profile, is closely related to the 

electron momentum density n(p) in the scatter and further depends on the scattering vector. 

Under impulse approximation, the directional profile 

)u(cid:1)qJ
(

 writes as [1,2]:

(cid:1)

( ) (

) pup
(cid:2)

(1) 

where q stands for the momentum variable and u points along the scattering vector.  

The  nature  of  momentum  electron  distributions  makes  this  technique  particularly 

sensitive to the slowest electrons, whereby bonding in condensed matter or molecules can be 

probed.  Thus,  Compton  experiments  provide  a  critical  test  for  the  quantum-mechanical 

description of such systems, allowing for quantitative comparisons with theoretical models.  

To  this  aim,  momentum  distributions  may  be  computed  from  various  wavefunction-

based models, including sophisticated schemes, e.g. configuration interaction (CI) or the like, 

or  more  tractably  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  calculations.  In  addition,  there  is  an  obvious  need  for 

computing momentum distributions from density functional theory (DFT) methods. However, 

as  outlined  by  Thakkar  [3],  forming  momentum  densities  from  Kohn-Sham  (KS)  orbitals 

remains an unsolved though early investigated problem. This point is discussed now.

1.3 Dilemma  

Basically,  there  is  a  need  for  computing  momentum  densities  directly  from  a  DFT 

calculation, with sufficient confidence in the accuracy for systematic quantitative comparison 

with  experiments.  However,  computing  the  momentum  density  directly  from  a  KS-1RDM 

(hereafter 

( )pKSn

),  is  questionable  in  the  extent  that 

  reflects  the  associated  KS 

( )pKSn

determinant corresponding to the fictious non-interacting system involved in this theory [5]. 

The resulting 

( )pKSn

 does hence not reflect the true wavefunction of the system. Thus, even if 

 

4 

exact  exchange-correlation  energy  were  available  (hence  giving  exact  energies),  the 

subsequent 

( )pKSn

  would  not  be  consistent  with  the  exact  DFT  kinetic  energy  as  part  of  it 

resides  outside  the  KS  determinant  [5].  In  contrast,  a  momentum  density  computed  from  a 

1RDM derived from a model wavefunction unambiguously reflects said wavefunction. This is 

in particular true at HF level, so that HF if sometimes seen as a more suitable theory for P-

space studies. 

Incidentally,  we  keep  in  mind  that  it  is  not  the  purpose  of  DFT  to  be  accurate  in  P-

space (this is not required in this theory). 

Yet,  the  scheme  proposed  by  Lam  and  Platzman  [6]  is  known  to  include  correlation 

corrections  to  momentum  densities  within  DFT.  In  the  context  of  the  local  density 

approximation  (LDA),  these  authors  have  proposed  a  practical  scheme,  in  which  the 

correction to the momentum density is computed from the difference between the interacting 

and  non-interacting  momentum  densities,  respectively  nI(p)  and  nNI(p),  taken  as  local 

functionals of the density r(R) of the system considered, that is

(10) 

This  approach,  isotropic  by  construction,  has  been  used  extensively,  mostly  for  metals  and 

semiconductors, which is natural in the context of the LDA. One may for instance refer to ref. 

[7]  for  discussion  and  comparison  of  the  above  scheme  with  an  alternative  including 

anisotropic  corrections.  The  Lam-Platzman  scheme  has  further  been  applied  to  atomic 

systems, bringing KS results close to HF ones [6,8], though numerical difficulties may occur 

due to long atomic density tails.  

In practice, corrections to KS momentum densities or Compton profiles are however 

often bypassed. The meaning of the resulting quantities is therefore questionable, as outlined 

in ref. [9]. In addition, the quality of the results strongly depends on the functionals used. It 

follows  that  it  is  unclear  whether  a  KS  approach  is  better  than  HF  for  P-space  or  not.  For 

 

5 

example,  it  was  concluded  that  KS  and  HF  approaches  were  comparable,  either  assessing 

approximate Dyson orbitals for the calculation of electron-momentum-spectroscopy scattering 

cross sections [10] or Compton profiles of water and  mixed  water-neon clusters [11].  Other 

studies have claimed superiority of HF for P-space studies of ice [12]. 

The  systematic  investigation  by  Thakkar  [3]  of  a  set  of  319  singlet  state  molecules 

helped  in  drawing  more  general  conclusions.  In  this  work,  the  calculation  of  P-space 

properties  from  KS  matrices  turned  on  average  worse  than  HF,  at  least  when  using  popular 

DFT approaches such as B3LYP within cc-PVTZ basis-set.  

It  would  be  unfair  to  extend  such  conclusions  to  any  DFT  approach,  due  to  the 

diversity  of  DFT  methods  (the  DFT  “zoology”).  Indeed,  aside  the  most  popular  DFT 

approaches, one may contemplate using functionals suitable for P-space studies. In this spirit, 

an  investigation  of  Zope  [13]  has  shown  that  a  self-interaction  corrected  LDA  formalism 

substantially improves atomic Compton profiles with respect to generalized gradient corrected 

(GGA)  approaches.  We  note  here  that  implementing  self-interaction  corrections  brings  the 

resulting  KS-1RDM  closer  to  HF-1RDM  as  the  latter  theory  also  excludes  self-interactions 

[5], which may explain the obtained improvement [14]. 

Further, in a different spirit, Harbola and co-workers [15] proposed a scheme valid for 

arbitrary  external  potentials  to  compute  P-space  properties,  based  on  a  variant  [16]  of  the 

Levy’s  constrained  search  approach  [17]  and  using  accurate  R-space  electron  densities. 

Application  to  atomic  systems  He,  Be  and  Ne  has  led  to  results  slightly  better  than  HF  on 

average when compared with more accurate theories. 

The DFT momentum moments of He, Be and Ne obtained from the methods used by 

Zope, Harbola and co-workers [13,15] are tabulated in table 1, compared with their HF [18] 

and  correlated  wavefunction  counterparts  [19,20,21].  As  can  be  seen  in  this  table,  the 

momentum  moments  of  refs.  [13,15]  may  improve  over  HF  values,  especially  at  high 

 

6 

momenta  (considering  correlated  wavefunction  methods  as  a  reference).  Thus,  it  seems  that 

there is a room for at least reaching HF-like accuracy when computing Compton profiles from 

KS orbitals, even if corrections are bypassed.  

In this respect, one may point out that though there is no need for the KS-1RDM to be 

closer than HF to the exact one, it is a priori not excluded that a KS determinant leads to a 

more accurate momentum density. Indeed, the HF wavefunction matches a hamiltonian which 

decomposes as the sum of one-electron operators, that is, not the true hamiltonian. Hence, HF 

and KS are just two different paradigms involving determinants.  

Now,  though  the  HF  theory  minimizes  the  determinantal  energy,  nothing  prevents  a 

different  determinant  (which  by  definition  gives  a  non-minimal  energy)  to  lead  to  a  higher 

kinetic  energy,  as  expected  from  the  virial  theorem  for  Coulomb  systems.  Therefore,  said 

different determinant may possibly leads to a more accurate momentum density, especially at 

high momenta (this is what happens in table 1, when using the approaches of refs. [13,15]).  

Moreover, since the KS scheme allows in principle to reach the exact R-space density, 

in contrast with HF, one may decently hope recovering more accurate P-space properties from 

the KS determinant only, even if no correction is contemplated.  

Therefore,  the  natural  first  step  to  assess  the  potential  of  DFT  versus  HF  for 

momentum-space studies would be to compare exact HF, exact KS and (near) exact results, at 

least for those systems making it is possible.  

To this aim, we investigate here a variety of two-fermion systems, for which exact KS 

orbitals  can  be  formulated  [22].  More  specifically,  P-space  properties  of  the  so-called 

Moshinsky atom [4,23,24], the Hooke’s atom [22] and light two-electron systems (H-, He) are 

compared  under  various  approximations  in  the  next  section  (sect.  II).  Considerations  on  the 

1RDM and auto correlation functions follow (section III) in view of a tentative conclusion.

Near  exact,  HF  and  KS  momentum  densities  of  some  two-

fermion systems 

We  can  take  advantage  of  dealing  with  two-particle  systems  to  define  the  unique

[9,16,22]  (adding  a  phase  to 

(cid:9) rKSj

(cid:8)

  would  lead  to  higher  kinetic  energies  [16]).  Thus, 

starting  from  an  accurate  (possibly  exact)  density 

( )rr ,  we  can  calculate  the  Fourier 

transform 

KSc  of 

KSj  and then the KS momentum density 

KSn

, except that the 

square of HF orbital is not proportional to the exact charge density but rather slightly deviates 

from it (typically in relative error of a few percents).  

The above expressions reflect the fact that a determinantal 1RDM can be written as a 

finite sum of orbital products, e.g. only one in the present case. In contrast, the exact 1RDM is 

known to involve an infinite sum of terms, reflecting that r and r’ variables are not separable

any  density  derived  from  the  1RDMs  above  will  differ  from  each  other  by  a  simple  scale 

factor in this case. Still, since a „ b (unless l = 0), the exponent in 1r  is not proportional to

;  the  exact

1r   can  thus  not  be  rewritten  as  a  single  orbital  product,  in  contrast  with 

HF(cid:1)1r   and 

KS(cid:1)1r .  Rather,  it  may  be  expanded  as  an  infinite  sum  of  orbital  products,  as  said 

above;  this  can  for  example  be  seen  by  expanding  the  term 

1

(cid:4)

e

  and  rearranging  the 

expanded terms as products of single variable orbitals.  

The  resulting  exact,  HF  and  KS  radial  momentum  densities  are  compared  in  fig.  1, 

considering the case k = 1/4, l = 1/12, where it appears that 

HFn

than 

KSn

 in this case.  

The  HF  and  KS  kinetic  energies  are  0.612372  and  0.549038  a.u.,  that  is,  in  error  of 

+3.5% and -7.2%, respectively, with respect to the exact kinetic energy (0.591506 a.u.). Thus, 

while the virial theorem implies the kinetic energy of a harmonic system in its ground state to 

 

9 

be minimal, the KS kinetic energy obtained is less than the exact one, illustrating that part of 

the exact kinetic energy resides outside the KS determinant. 

2.2 Hooke’s atom

confluent hypergeometric function. Such an expansion of n(p) converges rather slowly, e.g. as 

a result of the non-separability of the r and r’ variables in the 1RDM (see table 2).  

The  HF  momentum  density  was  obtained  by  expanding  the  HF  orbital  over  the 

harmonic-oscillator eigenfunctions, following ref. [26]. A similar expansion has been used for 

approximating  the  KS  orbital,  except  that  the  coefficients  of  the  expansion  were  afterwards 

fitted to the exact orbital

, allowing momentum densities to be obtained in 

closed form. Using the converged value T = 0.664418 a.u, the difference of kinetic energies 

with  respect  to  HF  and  KS  values  were  found  to  be  0.031884  and  0.028864  (numerical 

integration), respectively. Thus, a small part of the quantum-chemistry-like correlation kinetic 

energy  is  picked-up  by  KS  orbitals  in  that  case.  Accordingly,  nKS(p)  is  found  to  be  slightly 

closer than nHF(p) to the expanded n(p) of eq. (13), as can be seen from the radial differences 

plotted in fig. 2. In contrast with the Moshinsky’s atom, both nKS(p) and nHF(p) appear here to 

overestimate the number of momentum electrons at low momenta, consistently with the fact 

that kinetic energy is slightly underestimated in both cases. Additional comments are made in 

the next sections.

2.3 Case of light two-electron ions 

Amongst two-electron ions, the case of the anion H- is of special interest, due to the 

competition between inter electronic repulsion and attractive electron-nucleus potential. The 

HF theory does for instance predict it unstable, in contrast with accurate methods. Therefore, 

One may for instance contemplate using the following trial ground-state wavefunction

As can be seen from eq. (15), the obtained 1RDM shows explicit dependence between r and 

r’  variables,  via  the  scalar  product,  which  indirectly  results  from  two-particle  angular 

correlation, eqs. (3), (4) and (14). 

The  correlated  distributions  have  been  computed  for  H-  from  the  variationally 

optimized  wavefunction  of  eq.  (14),  allowing  93%  of  the  exact  correlation  energy  to  be 

 

12

recovered  and  leading  to  a  correlation  Compton  profile  in  very  good  agreement  with  the 

benchmark result of ref. [19], see ref. [27] for details.  

Again,  the  KS  momentum  distribution  has  been  computed  from  the  orbital

 in eq. (15). 

The correlated, HF and KS radial momentum densities of H- are compared in fig. 3. It 

is  striking  that  nKS(p)  is  closer  to  n(p)  than  nHF(p)  in  that  case.  The  numerically  computed 

difference  of  kinetic  energies  is  0.00791  a.u.  (KS  –  HF,  numerical  integration)  vs.  0.03815 

a.u. (Correlated – HF), revealing a lack of momentum transfer in both cases. Yet, a small part 

of the correlation kinetic energy is recovered from the KS orbital, as in the Hooke’s atom. 

The same observation holds for He (not shown here, see ref. [9]). The wavefunction of 

eq.  (14)  turns  however  substantially  less  accurate  in  this  case,  compared  with  H-,  due  to  an 

insufficient angular expansion of 

. Yet, the KS momentum density obtained yields 

mnf

(

momentum  moments  in  close  agreement  with  the  results  of  ref.  [15].  The  momentum 

moments of H- and He atomic systems are reported in table 3 together with those of Hooke’s 

atom obtained as described above. 

In line with the literature, the above results show that an exact KS matrix may lead to 

quite  accurate  P-space  properties  for  2-particles  systems.  In  the  case  of  the  pure  harmonic 

system (Moshinsky atom), HF gives a better momentum density. When electrons interact via 

the coulomb potential (Hooke’s atom, H-, He), the exact KS momentum density is just slightly 

more accurate than HF.  

However, the problem turns very different when the exact density is unknown, that is, 

when  approximate  functionals  are  needed  to  calculate  the  KS  orbitals.  As  an  example  (not 

reported  in  figures),  we  have  calculated  CISD,  HF  and  KS  densities  for  H-  and  He  within 

Aug-cc-pV5Z basis-set. For the DFT calculation, use was made of two classical packages of 

functionals,  namely  (i)  the  Slater  exchange  with  coefficient  2/3  [28]  and  the  Perdew  local 

 

13

correlation functional [29] (abbreviated as SPL) and (ii) the BPW91, that is, the Becke’s 88 

exchange  functional  [30]  and  Perdew/Wang’s  1991  correlation  functional  [31].  While  all 

computed KS charge and momentum densities substantially improve the HF ones in the case 

of  H-,  the  KS  charge  and  momentum  densities  obtained  for  He  reveals  instead  clearly  less 

accurate (with either SPL or BPW91 scheme). 

Thus,  a  distinction  should  be  made  between  exact  DFT  and  approximate  DFT.  As 

illustrated  in  the  above  examples,  using  exact  KS  orbitals  slightly  improves  the  HF 

computational  scheme  for  coulombic  systems.  In  contrast,  approximate  DFT  may  lead  to 

results worse than HF’s, hence recommending being cautious when directly interpreting KS 

orbitals in momentum space, in agreement with the conclusions drawn in refs. [3,13] (see also 

table 1).

Comparison of correlated, KS and HF spinless 1RDMs 

3.1 Case of 2-electron system 

Consider  now  a  general  2-electron  system  with  an  antisymmetric  spin  function,  the 

exact ground-state space wavefunction of which can formally be written as 

(

where  j  is  the  single  HF  orbital  involved,  assumed  real  and  positive,  and  g  correlates 

electrons  so  as  to  recover  the  exact  wavefunction  (g  includes  a  normalization  factor).  In 

particular, the correlation factor g(r1,r2) redistributes electron 1 about electron 2 along the r12 

axis  and  one  can  expect  it  to  be  less  than  1  for  small  r12  separation,  so  as  to  decrease  the 

probability of finding electrons close to each other. From this wavefunction, an expression for 

(17)

the exact 1RDM is

where  the  average  denotes  integration  over  r2,  weighted  by j2(r2).  Notice  that  the  above 

average “correlates” r1 and r1’ indirectly through r2. The HF-1RDM is simply

One can thus expect

 to be negative or zero for all s values. Since both

Now,  as  regards  the  difference  between  exact  and  HF  kinetic  energy,  a  distinction 

should  be  made  between  Coulomb  and  harmonic  systems,  for  which  the  virial  theorem  acts 

differently.  

In the case of Coulomb systems, the exact kinetic energy must be greater than the HF 

one, according to the virial theorem. Thus, one expects the difference 

)pn
(

- 

nHF

(

)p

 to be 

positive at large p. The same holds for 

)pn
(

- 

nKS

(

)p

, due to eq. (21). Here the respective 

behaviors of 

)pn
(

- 

nHF

(

)p

 and 

)pn
(

- 

nKS

(

)p

 are much the same. 

In contrast, for harmonic systems, the exact kinetic energy must be less than the HF 

one, owing to the virial theorem. Consistently, the difference 

)pn
(

- 

nHF

(

)p

 is likely to be 

negative at large p. However, 

)pn
(

- 

nKS

(

)p

 is expected to be positive at large p, due to eq. 

(21).  Thus, the  respective  behaviors  of 

)pn
(

- 

nHF

(

)p

  and 

)pn
(

- 

nKS

(

)p

  are  opposite  in 

this case. 

These remarks consistently reflect in the various trends observed from figures 1 to 3. 

Next,  at  large  r1  and  r1’  values  (that  is,  larger  than  a  characteristic  size  of j2(r2)), 

g(r1,r2) should become rather insensitive to fluctuations of r2 , so that one may approximate it 

by g(r1,0). Thus, one has

Hence, the KS matrix improves over HF at large distances. Meanwhile, the KS matrix 

tends to the exact charge density as r1 - r1’ goes to zero. Thus, the exact KS matrix has exact 

asymptotics, in contrast with the HF matrix.

28

Sin

( )q

 was picked-up from the six-dimensional term dR ds appearing in eq. (6); here 

reduced  by  symmetry  to  the  three  dimensions  spanned  by  R,  s  and  q  (that  is,  the  angle 

between R and s, which was set to q = p/4 in fig. 4). This representation makes it possible to 

appreciate  the  long-range  values  of  r~D ,  which  substantially  impact  the  computation  of  the 

momentum density  nD .  

As  expected  from  the  above  discussion,  the  difference

  is 

negative everywhere; it has a small spatial extension and a simple nodal structure compared

3.2 N-electron atomic systems 

N-electron  atomic  systems  are  shortly  discussed  here  for  the  sake  of  completeness. 

Some of the properties discussed above can straightforwardly be generalized to a N-electron 

system.

In  particular,  the  exact  KS  matrix  tends  advantageously  to  the  exact  density  as

. The exact KS matrix should thus be 

more  accurate  than  the  HF  matrix  at  very  small  s  values,  by  construction.  However,  after 

projection in the s subspace (after integration over R = (r + r’)/2), said advantage is at least 

partially  lost  since  both  BKS(s)  and  BHF(s)  are  normalized  and  have  the  same  limit  BKS(0)  = 

BHF(0) = B(0) = N.  

The extent of this possible improvement can be measured through the kinetic energy 

T. Indeed, since the convexity of the (spherically averaged) auto correlation function B(s) near 

s = 0 is proportional to the average kinetic energy, e.g. 

( )
sB

»ﬁ

0

s

-

32

, the better the 

latter, the better the auto correlation function at small s (and somehow the momentum density 

at large momenta, see eq. (6)).  

How exactly the charge density affects the momentum density at high momenta can be 

seen from the formula of Benesch and Smith [32], which have shown that an atomic charge 

density  satisfying  Kato’s  cusp  conditions  should  correspond  to  a  momentum  density 

asymptotically decaying as

.  

Accordingly, a momentum density obtained from a determinant giving the exact density (for 

instance  a  KS  determinant)  should  be  more  accurate  at  large  momenta.  However,  the 

improvement of KS over HF reflects only the superiority of the exact charge density over the 

HF density in this case. Accordingly, the key point in this case is therefore the charge density 

recovered from KS orbitals, as regards coulombic systems. 

Next,  as  regards  now  large  r1,  r1’  values,  determinantal  1RDMs  are  sometimes 

assumed to tend to (subjected to the limitations outlined in ref. [33]):

Hence, provided that eq. (22) applies, one has the limits:

, 

which again favors the exact KS matrix. 

Should  however  the  KS  matrix  have  an  exact  asymptotic  at  large  r1,  r1’,  it  is  not 

certain that the exact KS momentum density be more accurate than HF at small momenta, as 

seen  for  He,  in  table  1  (see  the  values  obtained  from  ref.  [15],  considering  that  exact  KS 

orbitals are obtained in ref. [15]).  

To  summarize,  the  structure  of  exact  KS  and  exact  HF  density  matrices  should  look 

much  the  same  as  they  derive  each  from  a  single  determinant  resulting  in  similar  charge 

densities. Thus, whether direct KS momentum densities of coulombic systems improve over 

HF depends on the quality of the R-space density recovered from KS orbitals, as reflects in 

the results listed in table 1. Another factor will be discussed in the concluding remarks. 

3.2 Simple corrections to N-electron atomic systems 

Finally,  as  outlined  above,  a  major  inconsistency  of  direct  KS  momentum  densities 

arises due to the fact that said densities do not reflect the true DFT kinetic energy, as part of it 

resides outside the KS determinant. In this respect, let us remark that nKS(p) may be corrected 

in a very simple manner so as to be consistent with the exact DFT kinetic energies, e.g. under 

scaling

where k  is  chosen  so  as  to  render  the  exact  or  any  guess  to  the  exact  DFT  kinetic  energy. 

Notice that amongst the cases studied above, the true n(p) might be obtained by scaling nKS(p) 

in the case of the Moshinsky atom only. 

Though no scheme exists in practice to extract the correlation part of the DFT kinetic 

energy, the latter can in many cases be inferred. A brute force method is to assume the DFT 

energy  obtained  for  some  system  at  equilibrium  to  be  the  exact  one,  whereby  the  kinetic 

energy follows directly from the virial theorem. Another way is to compute it from suitable 

functionals, see for example refs. [34,35] and more generally ref. [5].  

Then, once the exact or any guess to the exact DFT kinetic energy is known, the above 

scale factors can be computed so as to recover said kinetic energy from nKS(p). For example, 

considering the momentum  moments obtained from ref. [15] and taking k = 0.9937, 0.9975 

and 0.9987 respectively for He, Be  and Ne allows the exact kinetic energy to be recovered. 

Applying  the  above  scaling  further  reduces  the  mean  absolute  relative  error  on  the  reported 

momentum  moments  by  a  factor  two  on  average,  that  is,  reduces  it  from  0.8%  to  0.4%.  In 

comparison, the HF theory leads to an average error of 1.1% for the same systems.  

4. 

Conclusion 

The question of how DFT compares with HF for the computation of momentum-space 

properties was addressed in relation to systems for which (near) exact, exact KS and HF one-

electron matrices are known. In particular, we considered the Moshinsky atom, the Hooke’s 

atom  and  light  two-electron  ions,  for  which  expressions  for  correlated  density-matrices  or 

momentum  densities  have  been  derived  in  closed-form.  It  appears  that  using  exact  or  near 

exact  KS  orbitals  slightly  improves  over  HF  when  particles  (electrons)  interact  via  the 

Coulomb potential (Hooke’s atom, light two-electron ions). This is not true in the case of the 

Moshinsky atom, where particles repel each other via the Hooke’s law.  

 

20

Such  improvements,  if  any,  reflect  the  quality  of  the  one-electron  matrix  itself  and 

merely result from the fact the exact KS orbitals render an exact R-space density. Though said 

improvements are somehow artificial, they show that direct KS momentum densities may be 

more accurate than HF’s, even without corrections applied.  

As regards now "approximate" DFT and reverting merely to previous studies: whether 

direct KS momentum densities outperform HF strongly depends on the choice of functionals. 

However, for the purpose of computing momentum densities or related distributions in a DFT 

context,  said  functionals  should  be  carefully  chosen,  as  previously  suggested  [13,  15].  In 

particular,  it  seems  necessary  to  rethink  how  to  implement  the  specific  treatment  of 

correlation (possibly better to skip it, in view of table 1), since the structure of the KS-1RDM 

does not reflect it.  

This is illustrated in the following example. If correlation is specifically incorporated 

via some functionnals, care should be taken to suitably correct the KS-1RDM, as illustrated in 

ref. [35]. Indeed, consider for example a Colle-Salvetti’s like embodiment of correlation [36], 

i.e. starting from the following trial correlated wave function

A direct calculation of the 1RDM (applying eq. (2 - 4)) from the above wavefunction 

shows that it develops as

Thus, the 1RDM must therefore be somehow affected by correlation, contrasting in spirit with 

[36], where it is assumed that

. 

Thus, including correlation within a SCF calculation based on the 2RDM only while 

ignoring  effects  on  the  1RDM,  amounts  to  create  some  discrepancies  between  the  fictious 

system  represented  by  the  KS-1RDM  and  the  true  1RDM.  Therefore,  one  understands  that 

inclusion of correlation within a KS-DFT may adversely affect the KS-1RDM, as regards its 

direct conversion to a momentum density, as outlined in ref. [13].

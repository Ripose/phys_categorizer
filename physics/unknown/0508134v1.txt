Abstract 
The Doppler Effect associated with the reflection on a moving mirror is reduced to two Doppler 
Effect experiments involving the incoming incident ray and the outgoing reflected ray or vice-
versa.  The  dependence  of  the  corresponding  Doppler  factors  on  the  incidence  angle  on  the 
stationary mirror. 
 
 
 
 
The reflection of a plane-polarized light wave reflected from a uniformly moving mirror 
is  associated  with  two  Doppler  Effect  experiments.  Figure  1  shows  a  vertical  plane  mirror,  an 
incident and a reflected ray as detected from the mirror’s rest frame K’(X’O’Y’). The incidence 
and  the  reflection  take  place  at  the  origin  O’(0.0)  at  a  zero  time  t’=0  generating  the  event 
that  is  characterized  by  the  same  space-time  coordinates  in  all  inertial 
reference frames in relative motion. The mirror and its rest frame move with constant velocity V 
relative to the K(XOY) reference frame in the positive direction of the common OX(O’X’) axes. 
The corresponding axes of the two frames are parallel to each other. At the origin of time in the 
two frames (t=t’=0) the origins O and O’ are located at the same point in space. 
 
 
 

The  first  Doppler  Effect  experiment  involves  the  incident  ray,  observers

  due  to  the  aberration  of  light  effect.1  We  sketch  it  in 
as  measured  from  K.  It  differs  from 
Figure 2 and we derive the corresponding Doppler shift formula following a strategy proposed 
by Peres2 which reveals the limits of its applicability and the fact that we can derive it without 
using the Lorentz-Einstein transformations.

possible ways to obtain more insight. In the first case we can express r as a function of i but that 
solution does not offer more insight. In the second case we can express i and r as a function of 
the angle 
 that characterizes the reflection in the mirror’s rest frame via the aberration of light

transformations we can consider that our derivation is free of them, stressing the part played by 
clocks.  Involving  only  changes  in  the  readings  of  the  clocks  of  the  same  reference  frame,  the 
experiment that leads to (14) does not require clock synchronization at all.

Abstract 
 
Although not confirmed experimentally, it is generally accepted via theoretical arguments 
that black holes should radiate. In the present paper, the repulsive force generated by the 
exchange of photons between identical black holes is calculated by classical means. This 
force is independent of the size (mass) of the black holes; independent of the gravitational 
constant; and defines an effective charge q = 0.81×10−19 C = 0.51 e. This result is either 
hinting  at  a  connection  between  general  relativity  and  the  charge  of  fundamental 
particles, or is purely fortuitous.

Introduction 
 
Fundamental  particles  define  a  fundamental  unit  of  charge,  e  =  1.602×10−19  C.  The 
absolute  charges  of  the  leptons,  in  units  of  e,  are  0  and  1  with  an  average  of  ½.  The 
absolute charges of the quarks, in units of e, are 1/3 and 2/3, also with an average value 
of ½. There are no accepted theoretical reasons for the known charges of the fundamental 
particles. In the present paper, the repulsive force generated by the classical exchange of 
photons between two identical black holes is determined. This force is independent of the 
mass of the identical black holes and the strength of gravity, and defines a unit of charge 
close to 0.5 e.  
 
It has been known for more than 30 years that quantum mechanical effects should cause 
black holes to radiate as a black body with temperature [1-3]

where  Mo  is  a  solar  mass.  The  life  span  of  large  black  holes  formed  by  the  collapse  of 
stars is much longer than the life of the present universe (~1017 s). However, the life span 
of  small  black  holes  with  masses  less  than  ~106  kg  should  be  less  than  ~1  s  assuming 
only photon emission, and much shorter if the emission of other particles is included. 
 
The luminosity of black holes 
 
The luminosity of photons from a charge-less non-rotating black hole is given by

where σ  is  the  Stefan-Boltzmann  constant.  Consider  a  black  hole  with  temperature  T, 
placed in a heat oven at the same temperature. Using Eq. (3), and assuming the black hole 
emits and absorbs radiation at each wavelength, λ, at the same rate, one can show that the 
black-hole  photon  absorption  cross  section, σc,  is  independent  of  photon  energy  and  is 
2.  This  creates  a  paradox,  because  this  value  differs  from  the  value  of 
equal  to  πrs
2  obtained  using  classical  general  relativity,  where  the  photon  wavelengths 
σc=6.75×πrs
are  assumed  to  be  very  small  compared  to  the  size  of  black  holes.  If  the  capture  cross 
section defined by Eq. (3) is assumed to be valid for photons with λ much larger than the 
classical capture radius, rc=2.598×rs, and the classical value is assumed correct when λ is 
much smaller than rc, then σc is dependent on the photon energy and, therefore, Hawking 
radiation  would  not  be  exactly  thermal.  The  wavelength  of  Hawking  radiation  can  be 
expressed as

(4)

where the photon energy ε is in units of κT. The wavelengths of the emitted photons do 
not become less than the classical capture radius until ε is larger than ~30. Therefore, any 
deviation  of  Hawking  radiation  from  thermal  may  only  be  confined  to  the  high-energy 
tail  of  the  emission  spectrum.  However,  it  has  been  claimed  that  Hawking  radiation  is 
exactly  thermal  [3].  If  the  emission  of  Hawking  radiation  is  exactly  thermal  then  the 
capture cross section must be equal for all energy photons and thus must be equal to the 
2. This would cause Eq. (3) to underestimate the luminosity of 
classical value of 6.75×πrs
Hawking radiation by a factor of 6.75 (see Appendices A and B). It is interesting to note 
that once the temperature and capture cross section are defined, then the evaporation of 
mass-less particles from a black hole can be determined by simple classical methods. The 
black-hole  luminosity  obtained  by  the  classical  means  outlined  in  Appendices  A  and  B 
differs from Hawking radiation by a factor of 6.75 and must be due to subtle effects, not 
understood  by  the  present  author,  and  thus  not  included  in  the  classical  calculations 
presented here.  
 
The force between black holes associated with particle exchange 
 
We shall now calculate the repulsive force generated by the exchange of photons between 
identical  black  holes,  h1  and  h2.  The  force  generated  by  the  Hawking  radiation  that  is 
emitted from h1 and absorbed by h2 is given by

2 is the photon black-hole 
where L is the luminosity of each of the black holes, σc = πrc
capture  cross  section,  rc  is  the  capture  radius,  and  d  is  the  distance  between  the  black 
holes. It can be shown that if classical general-relativity photon paths are assumed, then 
an  attractive  force  is  generated  by  the  photons  emitted  from  one  black  hole  and 
gravitationally  scattered  to  infinity  by  the  other.  However,  here  we  are  confining 
ourselves to the force generated by photons that are exchanged between the black holes, 
i.e.  only  the  photons  emitted  by  one  black  hole  and  absorbed  by  the  other.  This  is  the 
same  as  the  force  generated  by  the  photons,  assuming  that  all  emission  to  infinity  is 
artificially turned off. The total force generated by photons going both from h1 to h2, and 
h2 to h1 is twice the force given in Eq. (5). The luminosity term varies with the inverse 
square  of  the  assumed  black  hole  mass,  while  the  capture  cross  section  varies  with  the 
square  of  this  mass,  and  therefore  the  force  is  independent  of  the  assumed  mass  of  the 
identical black holes. For the same reason, the force is also independent of the magnitude 
of the gravitational constant, G.  This is an interesting property of this force, and means 
that, although the existence of gravity is needed to generate it, its strength is independent 
of  the  strength  of  gravity.  The  force  generated  by  the  exchange  of  photons  between 
identical  black  holes  can  be  expressed  in  the  form  of  electrostatic  repulsion  between 
identical charges,

This effective charge is q = 0.81×10−19 C = 0.51 e.  For the classical exchange of photons 
plus three classes of mass-less neutrinos, the effective charge is the result given by Eq. 
(9) multiplied by the square-root of 1+21/8 (see the result for the emission of mass-less 
fermions  in  Appendix  B).  This  corresponds  to  an  effective  charge  of  0.97  e.    If  the 
luminosity  given  in  Eq.  (3)  is  assumed,  then  the  calculated  effective  charge  drops  by  a 
factor  of  6.75.    These  values  of  an  effective  charge  near  the  known  charges  of 
fundamental particles are either an interesting or a highly fortuitous result. The repulsive 
force  calculated  here,  associated  with  the  classical  exchange  of  particles  between 
identical black holes with all particle emission to infinity artificially turned off, might be 
viewed  as  a  classical  analog  of  the  exchange  of  virtual  particles  between  identical 
fundamental particles. 
 
The  repulsive  force  associated  with  the  exchange  of  classical  photons  between  two 
identical black holes is independent of their  masses  and  therefore,  below  a  given  mass, 
this repulsive force will be larger than the force of gravity. Assuming the effective charge 
given in Eq. (9), this transition point is at a mass of

which is 9.4×10−10 kg. A black hole with this mass has an event horizon circumference 
close to  half  the  Planck length and a temperature close to the Planck temperature. This 
mass  transition  point  is  near  to  another  possibly  interesting  mass  scale.  Consider  the 
energy contained in the electric field of a point particle with charge e outside a radius R 
and the energy of a charge-less non-rotating black hole with radius R′. The radius when 
these two energies are equal defines a mass

which  is  9.3×10−10  kg.  It  is  unclear  if  the  results  presented  here  are  hinting  at  a 
connection  between  general  relativity  and  a  fundamental  unit  of  charge,  or  are  purely 
fortuitous.  Assuming  the  former,  the  possibility  that  the  forces  between  fundamental 
particles  are  caused  by  the  exchange  of  virtual  particles,  between  quantum  black  holes, 
should be pursued.

This means that the luminosity at infinity of a shell at radius rsh can be determined using 
σT4 times an area, with the area and temperature of the shell as observed at infinity, but 
not by using the temperature at infinity and the real radius of the shell. If the mass M is a 
black hole and the shell is inside the photon sphere, then the capture radius is defined by 
the impact parameter where a photon falls into a circular orbit on the photon sphere at a 
radius of 3rs/2. This corresponds to the black-hole capture radius of

assume  that  the  shell  at  the  photon  sphere  is  in  equilibrium  with  the  black  hole  and  at 
equilibrium  with  a  shell  at  infinite  radius  at  temperature  T∞  .  The  photon  sphere  is  a 
unique  location.  All  photon  emission  from  the  photon  sphere,  in  an  outward  direction, 
escapes to infinity, while all photons emitted in an inward direction will be captured by 
the  black  hole.  The  luminosity  from  the  black  hole  must,  therefore,  be  equal  to  the 
luminosity of the inner surface of the shell at the photon sphere. The luminosity from the 
inner surface of the shell, at the photon sphere, must equal the luminosity from the outer 
surface of this shell. This luminosity must be equal to the rate at which photons emitted 
from  the  shell  at  infinity  are  absorbed  by  the  shell  at  the  photon  sphere.  For  photons 
emitted  from  the  shell  at  infinity,  the  capture  cross  section  of  the  shell  at  the  photon 
2 (see (A6)), and thus the rate of energy absorption from the shell 
sphere is σps=6.75×πrs
at infinity onto the shell at the photon sphere is equal to

Via  the  above-discussed  arguments,  this  is  the  luminosity  of  the  black  hole,  and  is  the 
same  result  as  given  by  (A8).  This  is  not  surprising,  since  it  is  the  same  argument  but 
presented in a slightly different way. The factor of 2 in front of the σps term in (A9) is 
there  because,  given  the  chosen  location  of  the  black  hole  in  the  middle  of  the  shell  at 
infinity, all photons emitted from the shell at infinity and absorbed by the photon sphere 
must  be  normal  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  outer  shell  and  the  angular  distribution  of 
black-body  radiation  from  a  flat  surface  is  2⋅cos(θ)  dΩ  where  θ  is  the  angle  of  the 
photons  to  the  vector  normal  to  the  surface.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  result  in  (A9)  is 
independent of the chosen location of the black hole inside the outer shell. 
 
Appendix B. The classical evaporation of mass-less particles from a black hole 
 
The  rate  at  which  photon  energy  is  evaporated  from  a  hot  system  can  be  estimated  by 
several classical means of varying complexity, once the temperature of the system T and 
the  capture  cross  section σc  are  defined.  One  of  these  methods  is  to  use  the  theory  of 
particle evaporation from a hot nucleus developed by Weisskopf [4]. Consider a photon 
with energy ε and a black hole in a box with volume V. The mean probability per unit 
time for the photon to be captured is

states of helicity). The result given by (B2) corresponds to spontaneous emission because 
the  Weisskopf-box  only  includes  the  absorber  and  a  single  photon,  and  therefore  no 
photon-photon interactions are being considered. The result (B2) is therefore the photon 
emission  rate  assuming  the  presence  of  no  other  photons,  and  thus  corresponds  to  the 
spontaneous emission rate. The well known result for N(ε)dε  is

If rc is assumed to be the classical photon black-hole capture radius, 2.598×rs, then (B7) 
is the same result as (A8). Notice that to obtain the black body result exactly, the capture

This is a suppression of the spontaneous emission caused by Pauli blocking. If a fermion 
is near an excited state (a region about to emit), it suppresses the emission from that state

the emission of mass-less fermions is therefore given by

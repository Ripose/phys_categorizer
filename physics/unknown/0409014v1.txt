ABSTRACT 

The  formula  for  the  frequency  shift  of  a  plane-polarized  light  beam  reflected  from  a 

uniformly  moving  mirror  is  derived  in  the  case  of  an  oblique  incidence  by  using  the 

constant light speed postulate and the basic principles of wave optics.

A  plane-polarized  light  wave  reflected  from  a  uniformly  moving  mirror  will 

suffer a frequency change [1]. This special case of the Doppler effect was predicted and 

described in the framework of the special theory of relativity [2]. The standard Lorentz-

transformation  procedure  was  employed  to  show  that  the  value  of  this  frequency  shift 

depends on the angle of incidence of the wave and the velocity of the moving mirror. The 

formula for this Doppler shift also can be obtained directly from the constant light speed 

postulate  and  the  basic  principles  of  wave  optics  [3,  4].  However,  only  the  case  of  a 

normal  incidence  of  the  light  beam  was  considered.  The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to 

investigate  a  more  general  case,  that  is,  when  the  light  is  at  oblique  incidence  on  a 

uniformly moving mirror. 

Figure 1 shows a plane-polarized light beam incident on a vertical plane mirror. 

The mirror is moving at a constant velocity v to the right. We denote by α the angle of

incidence, and by β the angle of reflection of the light. We let A and B be the points of 

two successive wavefronts of the incident light beam a distance 

0λ=AB

 apart, where λ0 

equals the wavelength of the incident light. The wavefront at point B will be reflected by 
the mirror at time t0. On the other hand, the wavefront at A will have to travel the path 

AA

  before  being  reflected  by  the  mirror.  The  reflection  will  occur  off  the 

point A′ at time t, when the mirror is located at a distance v(t − t0) to the right from its 

position at time t0. For the same amount of time (t − t0) required for the wavefront at A to 

cover  the  path  AA ′ ,  the  wavefront  reflected  at  B  will  traverse  the  path

. 

Here, we have taken into account that the speed of the reflected wavefront will equal c, 

which is a consequence of the constant light speed postulate [5]. 

Observe  from  Fig.  1  that  the  paths  of  the  reflected  wavefronts  will  not  coincide 

due to the shift of the wavefronts caused by the motion of the mirror [5]. Also observe 

that  the  distance

BA ′

  is  the  shortest  (orthogonal)  distance  between  the  planes  of  the 

reflected wavefronts located at A′ and B′, and it equals the wavelength λ of the reflected 

light. From Fig. 1 we have

described in this paper is also applicable when the moving mirror is inclined at an angle

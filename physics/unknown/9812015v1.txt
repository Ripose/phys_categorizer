Abstract

An  analog  integrated  circuit  has  been  designed,  in  a
BiCMOS 0.8 micron technology, for the  feasability  study  of
the  signal  processing  of  the  AMS  RICH  photomultiplier
tubes  [1].  This  low  power,  three  channel  gated  integrator
includes its own gate generator and no external analog delay
is required. It processes PMT pulses over a dynamic range of
100. An external RC network allows it to work with  various
PMT gains. It provides a logic output  that  indicates  whether
the associated analog output has to be considered. This gated
integrator  is  used  with  a  compact  DSP  based  acquisition
system  in  a  132  channel  RICH  prototype.  The  charge
calibration of each channel of the RICH  is  carried  out  using
the  light  of  a  LED.  The  pedestal  measurement  is  performed
on  activation  of  a  dedicated  input.  The  noise  contribution
study  of  the  input  RC  network  and  of  the  amplifier's  is
presented.

I.  INTRODUCTION

Although  the  RICH  for  the  AMS  project  is  not  today
completely  defined,  it  is  reasonable  to  think  that  it  will
include  between  3000  and  10000  PMTs.  This  large  number
of detector cells and the low power consumption required by
the  spacial  constraints  lead  to  the  integration  of  the  analog
processing  part  of  the  PMT  signals.  The  simulation  results
[2]  show  that  the  number  of  photons  detected  by  each  PMT
can  reach  50  for  heavy  ions  beyond  oxygen  in  a  1x1  cm2
pixel.  Thus  the  electronic  dynamic  range  must  be  from  1  to
about 100. At least two methods can deliver  information on
the  number  of  photons  detected  by  a  PMT.  The  first  one
based on the time over threshold measurement, after  a  pulse
stretching,  had  been  proposed  for  the  AMS  RICH  [3].  The
main  drawback  of  this  method  is  that  a  small  offset  on  the
voltage comparator  input  produces  a  large  error  on  the  final
measurement.  The  offset  has  to  be  carefully  adjusted  and
controlled.  As  the  number  of  channels  is  quite  large,  this
adjustment can become onerous. The other method which we
retained is the PMT pulse charge integration. This self gated
integrator  includes  its  own  gate  generator  and  no  analog
delay  is  required.  An  external  RC  network  performs  the
stretching  of  the  PMT  pulse  and  minimizes 
the  non
integrated  part  of  the  input  signal.  The  error  introduced  by
this  processing  method  depends  mainly  on  the  comparator
speed.  The  worst  case  is  reached  for  the  single  photon
detection  but  even  for  this  case  the  error  is  negligible.  The
block  diagram  of  one  channel  of  the  integrated  circuit  is
given  in  Figure  1.  Some  circuits  performing  a  charge  to
voltage  conversion  have  already  been  designed,  but  they
require an external  gate  signal  and  their  power  consumption
is not compatible with the AMS constraints [4].

When  a  pulse  occurs  at  the  output  of  a  PMT  (figure  2),
the  voltage  comparator  triggers  on  the  monostable  that
enables the charge to voltage converter to integrate the input
charge during a period fixed by the monostable. The dynamic
range  of  the  integrated  charge  is  from  0.2  pC  for  the  single
photoelectron to 20 pC. If the STROBE signal occurs during
the  monostable  pulse,  the  output  of  the  charge  to  voltage
converter  is  transferred  to  the  sample  and  hold  circuit.  This
coincidence  also  sets  a  RS  flipflop  which  indicates  that  the
analog  output  has  to  be  stored  after  digitalization.  The
switches shown in Figure 1 are built with two complementary
MOS transistors to reduce the ON resistance and the injected
charges. The sample and  hold  circuit  stores  the  result  of  the
integration  until  it  is  converted  by  an  external  ADC.  The
converter (AD9220 a 12-bit, 10 MSPS, 250mW ADC) uses a
pipelined architecture and processes 32 analog channels. It is
located  on  the  same  printed  board  as  the  ASICs.  The
STROBE  signal  provided  by  the  RICH  trigger  enables  the
conversion of each analog channel and the storage of the data
depends on the state of the logical output [5].

II.  VOLTAGE COMPARATOR

The  comparator  must  be  of  high  speed  and  high  gain  in
order  to  enable  the  integrator  with  minimum  delay  to
minimize the non integrated part of the stretched PMT pulse.

Figure 3 : Comparator schematics

A passive network performs the shaping of the PMT pulse
(Figure 1). The pulse amplitude depends mainly on the value
of  the  capacitor.  This  capacitance  of  about  15  pF  stands  for
the  10  cm  coaxial  cable  and  the  printed  circuit  board
capacitance. The comparator must have a dynamical range of
100  and  the  pulse  amplitude,  limited  by  the  negative  power
supply, must be lower than -3V. The single photon amplitude
has  to  be  set  at  a  value  of  -30mV  to  meet  these  conditions.
The PMT gain can be directly deduced from the expression :

The threshold is set at -10 mV which  corresponds  to  one
third of the single photon mean amplitude. The inverting and
non  inverting  inputs  (Figure  3)  are  accessible  allowing  the
integrator to be enabled by an anode or a dynode pulse. This
provides  the  possibility  to  integrate  larger  pulses  without
enabling the comparator above the power supply. The typical
delay  is  3.5  ns  and  the  time  walk  less  than  4  ns  over  the
whole dynamical range (Figure 4). The time walk is a critical
point for the linearity in small signals.

The  gated  integrator,  or  charge  to  voltage  converter,  is
built using a charge preamplifier structure. In the absence of
an enable signal from the monostable, the MOS switch is on,
so  the  loop  gain  is  about  –1.  When  a  pulse  occurs,  the

allows the adjustment  of  the  integrator  gain  to  various  PMT
gains.  The  two  gain  stage  structure  provides  an  open  loop

To avoid a leakage current due to the amplifier offset and
due also to the comparator biasing input current.

III.  MONOSTABLE

The  monostable  provides  a  pulse  with  a  fixed  duration
from  the  output  of  the  comparator  (Figure  7).  This  signal
directly controls the integration duration. The leading edge of
the  comparator  output  is  differentiated  by  the  capacitor  C1
and  used  to  charge  the  capacitor  C2  through  the  MOS
transistor  M1.  Then  this  capacitor  is  discharged  under  a

the delay of the charge to voltage converter the leading edge

is  directly  driven  by 

IV.  SAMPLE AND HOLD

The  sample  and  hold  circuit  stores  the  voltage  value  of
the  integrator  until  this  value  is  transfered  to  the  ADC.  The
amplifier  of    the  sample  and  hold  circuit  has  a  MOS
transistor input in  order  to  reduce  the  leakage  current  of  the
hold capacitor. The storing time required for the sample and
hold  circuit  is  determined  by  the  speed  of  the  ADC.  With  a
3pF  hold  capacitor,  a  storing  time  larger  than  100  m s  is
achieved  without  significant  voltage  loss  at  the  output.  The
ADC  is  multiplexed  with  32  analog  channels.  Its  pipelined
architecture  leads  to  convert  each  channel  and  the  digital
outputs of the integrator indicate which analog output has to
be stored after digitalization.

of the RICH (132 PMT channels) on which the whole system
is going to be validated.

Abstract 

Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results of sustained acceleration of electron-positron (e+e-) 

plasmas  by  comoving  electromagnetic  (EM)  pulses  are  presented.      When  a  thin  slab  of 

overdense  e+e-  plasma  is  irradiated  with  linear-polarized  ultra-intense  short  laser  pulses  from 

both  sides,  the  pulses  are  transmitted  when  the  plasma  is  compressed  to  thinner  than  ~  2 

relativistic skin depths.  A fraction of the plasma is then captured and efficiently accelerated by 

self-induced JxB forces.  For 1µm laser and1021Wcm-2 intensity, the maximum energy exceeds 

GeV in a picosecond.

      Recent  advances  in  ultra-intense  short-pulse  lasers  (ULs)  [1,2]  revolutionize  particle 

acceleration  via  intense  electromagnetic  (EM)  fields  [3].    Most  proposed  laser  acceleration 

schemes  (e.g.  laser  wakefield  accelerator  (LWFA),  plasma  wakefield  accelerator  (PWFA)  [4], 

free-wave  accelerator  (FWA)  [5])  require  propagating  lasers  in  an  underdense  plasma 

(ωpe=(4πne2/m)1/2<ωo=2πc/λ,  λ=laser  wavelength,  n=electron  density,  m=electron  mass).      In 

such  schemes  the  energy  gain/distance  [4]  and  particle  beam  intensity  are  constrained  by  the 

underdense requirement.  Here we report particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation results of a radically 

different  concept:  comoving  acceleration  of  overdense  (ωpe>ωo)  plasmas  using  colliding  UL 

pulses.  This colliding laser pulses accelerator (CLPA) has properties, such as higher acceleration 

gradient and particle beam intensity, that are complementary to underdense schemes.  

When  an  intense  EM  pulse  with  Ωe  (=eBo/mc=aoωo,  ao=normalized  vector  potential)>ωpe 

initially imbedded in an overdense plasma tries to escape, it induces a skin current J that inhibits 

the  EM  field  from  leaving.    The  induced  J  x  B  (ponderomotive)  force  then  accelerates  the 

surface plasma to follow the EM pulse.  As the EM pulse “pulls” the surface plasma, it is slowed 

by plasma loading (group velocity < c), allowing the fastest particles to “comove” with the EM 

pulse.  Since slower particles eventually fall behind, the plasma loading decreases and the EM 

pulse accelerates over time.  A dwindling number of fast particles gets accelerated indefinitely 

by the comoving EM force, reaching maximum Lorentz factors γmax>ao

2/2 (ponderomotive limit 

[6]) >>(Ωe/ωpe)2.  This phenomenon, called the diamagnetic relativistic pulse accelerator (DRPA) 

[7],  is  a  nonlinear  relativistic  phenomenon,  with  no  analog  in  the  weak  field  (Ωe/ωpe<1),  low 

density (ωo>ωpe) regime or test particle limit.  

But DRPA is difficult to achieve in the laboratory, since vacuum EM waves cannot penetrate 

an overdense plasma beyond the relativistic skin depth [8].  Fig.1 shows the PIC simulation of a 

single UL irradiating an overdense e+e- plasma.  All upstream plasma is snowplowed by the UL 

 

2 

light pressure, and the asymptotic Lorentz factor stays below γmax~45.  The relativistic snowplow 

compresses the density, so the plasma stays overdense and ahead of the EM pulse, preventing the 

UL from passing through.  Even when the initial slab thickness is less than the relativistic skin 

depth,  we  find  that  ponderomotive  snowplowing  supersedes  wave  transmission,  and  the  EM 

pulse fails to overtake the plasma (Fig.1).  Hence the DRPA initial condition cannot be achieved 

using a single UL pulse. Using PIC simulations with the 2.5D (2D-space, 3 momenta) ZOHAR 

code [9], here we report that sustained comoving acceleration similar to DRPA can be achieved 

by  irradiating  a  thin  slab  of  overdense  e+e-  plasma  with  UL  pulses  from  both  sides.    The 

opposing UL pulses first compress the overdense plasma to a total thickness < 2 relativistic skin 

depths  [8]  while  keeping  the  central  plasma  in  place.    At  that  point  the  UL  pulses  “tunnel” 

through  the  overdense  plasma  (ωpe  >  <γ>1/2ωo,  <γ>=mean  Lorentz  factor  of  the  compressed 

plasma).  The subsequent acceleration via comoving JxB forces resembles DRPA [7]. 

Fig.2 shows the evolution of two linearly polarized half-cycle plane EM pulses with parallel 

B, irradiating a thin e+e- slab from opposite sides (thickness=λ/2, initial density no=15ncr(critical 

density)).    Cases  with  nonparallel  B  are  more  complex  and  will  be  reported  separately.    The 

incident  pulses  initially  snowplow  the  plasma  inward  as  in  Fig.1  (Fig.2a).  Only  ~10%  of  the 

incident  amplitudes  is  reflected  during  the  compression  as  the  laser  reflection  fronts  move 

inward relativistically [10].  When the skin currents from both sides merge (Fig.2b), the two UL 

pulses  interpenetrate  and  tunnel  through  the  plasma,  despite  ωpe > <γ>1/2ωo.    Such  overdense 

transmission  of  EM  pulses  occurs  only  because  the  plasma  thickness  is  <  2  relativistic  skin 

depths and the central plasma is kept in place by the opposing light pressure.  As the transmitted 

UL pulses reemerge from the plasma, they induce new drift currents J at the trailing edge of the 

pulses (Fig.2c), with signs opposite to the initial currents (Fig.2b), so that the J x B forces pull 

the  plasma  outward  and  load  the  EM  pulses.    This  plasma  loading  plays  a  crucial  role  in 

 

3 

sustaining the comoving acceleration: a larger fraction of plasma is picked up and accelerated for 

higher  initial  densities  (cf.Fig.4a  below).  As  slower  particles  eventually  fall  behind  the  UL 

pulses, the UL plasma loading decreases with time. This leads to continuous acceleration of both 

the UL pulses and the fastest particles.  The growth of px vs. x (Fig.2d) of CLPA resembles that 

of DRPA [7] at late times.  

Fig.3  shows  the  results  of  irradiating  an  overdense  e+e-  slab  using  Gaussian  pulse  trains 

(λ=1µm,  pulse  length  τ=85fs,  Ipeak=1021Wcm-2).  Here  the  compressed  plasma  slab  cleanly 

separates  into  left  and  right-moving  pulses  only  after  the  peaks  of  the  two  wave  trains  have 

passed each other.  Fig.3b shows that γmax grows as a power-law in time (γmax~t0.8), reaching 2200 

(1.1GeV) in 1.3ps, far exceeding the nominal ponderomotive limit ao

2/2 (=360; this limits does 

not apply because the instantaneous ao increases with time due to pulse stretching, Fig.3c). We 

can derive this γmax growth rate from the Lorentz equation: dγmax(t)/dt~eE(t)mc where E(t) is the 

UL electric field comoving with the fastest particles. From the output we confirm that E(t)~t-0.2 

due  to  energy  transfer  to  the  particles  (Fig.3c  shows  decay  of  the  B  profile).    The  asymptotic 

particle spectrum also forms a power-law with slope  ~ –1 (Fig.3d).  Such power-law spectrum is 

distinct  from  the  usual  exponential  spectrum  produced  by  ponderomotive  stochastic  heating 

[11,12]. A power-law is formed since there is no other preferred energy scale below γmax, and the 

particles develop random phases over time with respect to the EM field profile.  In practice, γmax 

is limited by the diameter D of the laser focal spot, since particles drift transversely out of the 

laser  beam  after  t~D/c.  Dimensionally,  the  maximum  energy  of  any  comoving  acceleration  is 

thus <eEoD=6GeV(I/1021Wcm-2)1/2(D/100µm). We find no evidence of any transverse instability, 

which  is  suppressed  by  relativistic  effects  plus  strong  transverse  E,  B  fields  that  oppose 

momentum isotropization.

Fig.4 compares results of different laser and plasma parameters.  Fig4a shows that both 

spectral  hardness  and  γmax  increase  with  intensity,  while  particle  pickup  increases  with  plasma 

density. In Fig4b we show variation with pulse length τ.  At first γmax increases but the power-law 

slope stays constant as we increase τ.  But for long pulses, γmax ~constant while the slope hardens 

with  increasing  τ.      Fig.4c  compares  the  energy  coupling  efficiency  for  sample  intensities  and 

densities. We find that EM energy coupling to particles increases with intensity and with density, 

reaching a maximum of 45% among the runs completed so far.  After saturation the particle and 

EM  energies  oscillate  (curves  D–G)  because,  while  the  fastest  particles  continue  to  accelerate, 

the  slower  tail  particles  transfer  energy  back  to  EM  waves  at  late  times.    Fig.4d  compares  the 

energy-angle distributions for sample intensities and densities.  The highest energy particles are 

narrowly  beamed.    We  have  scratched  only  the  tip  of  the  vast  CLPA  parameter  space.    A  full 

exploration is underway but will require many years of systematic studies. 

An  experimental  demonstration  of  the  CLPA  will  require  a  dense  and  intense  e+e-  source. 

Cowan  et  al  [13]  demonstrated  that  such  an  e+e-  source  can  be  achieved  using  a  PW  laser 

striking  a  gold  foil.    Theoretical  works  [14]  suggest  that  e+e-  densities  >1022cm-3  may  be 

achievable with sufficient laser fluence.  Such a dense e+e- jet can be slit-collimated to produce a 

< micron thin e+e- slab, followed by 2-sided irradiation with opposing UL pulses. For example, 

UL  pulses  with  τ=80fs,  peak  intensity=1021Wcm-2  and  spot  diameter  D=15µm  require  1.8PW 

peak  power  and  70J,  within  the  range  of  UL’s  currently  under  construction.    Fig.3bd  (black 

curves)  suggest  that  pairs  can  be  accelerated  to  a  power-law  with  Emax>100MeV,  easily 

distinguishable  from  an  exponential  spectrum  with  kT~16MeV  produced  by  ponderomotive 

heating [12].  Note that if one pulse arrives first, it simply pushes the plasma until the opposing 

pulse hits.  The subsequent evolution is similar to the simultaneous arrival cases reported above.

We  have  also  studied  the  effects  of  finite  laser  spot  size.    Preliminary  results  suggest  that  for 

sufficiently uniform core intensity, our plane wave results remain valid in the core.

ABSTRACT: The focus of the study presented in this paper is to provide reliable criteria that can be used to 
estimate the degree of compatibility between the French limestone tuffeau and mortar. It is suggested through 
this study to use the same parent material (i.e., tuffeau) as mortar. The mortar used in this study is composed 
of non-hydraulic (hydrated) lime or hydraulic lime and aggregates obtained from fragments and powder of the 
tuffeau stone. Water transfer properties and mechanical behaviour of the mortars are evaluated and compared 
with the original stone Tuffeau. Based on these studies, some key guidelines are provided such that a mortar 
that is compatible with properties of Tuffeau and can be prepared and used as construction material of monu-
ments and maintenance purposes. 
 

1  INTRODUCTION  

Sedimentary  rocks  such  as  limestones  have  been 
commonly  used  in  the  construction  of  several  his-
torically  important  monuments  and  structures  for 
many centuries in various parts of the world. These 
structures are standing examples of our cultural heri-
tage and civilization. For this reason, such structures 
should be preserved and well maintained for our fu-
ture generations. However, due to the action of wa-
ter  and  the  influence  of  environment  and  pollution, 
these  structures  gradually  deteriorate  over  a  period 
of  time.  Several  millions  of  dollars  are  annually 
spent for the maintenance and repair works of these 
valuable  structures  in  various  parts  of  the  world. 
There  are  various  construction  methods  that  have 
been  developed  based  on  experience  to  repair  these 
structures. Investigations in this direction has shown 
suitable  mortars  can  be  suggested  for  repair  works 
by better understanding the mechanical, physical and 
chemical  properties  of  the  mortars  in  addition  to  a 
rigorous evaluation process of their performance un-
der  varying  environmental  conditions.  Analysis  of 
numerous  cases  of  degradation  of  the  architectural 
monuments  in  Loire  Valley  (France)  show  that  the 
damages often find their origin to the type of mortar 
that is used in the construction. From the second half 
of  the  20th  century,  restoration  of  several  historical 
monuments  was  undertaken  mainly  using  cement 
mortars  as  joints  between  stones.  Several  damages 

were attributed due to the use of cement mortar par-
ticularly  when  used  with  limestones  (Rautureau 
2001).  Studies  have  shown  chemical  characteristics 
of  cement  (essentially  its  alkaline  salts  content)  are 
incompatible  with  limestone.  Furthermore,  cement 
mortars  are  hard,  stiff  and  have  a  high  adhesion 
force  which  partly  contributes  towards  the  increase 
in  the  brittleness  property  of  stones.  In  addition,  an 
impermeable mortar favors the accumulation of wa-
ter in the stone and constitutes a zone that increases 
dissolution and recrystallization (Fig. 1).  
Lime based mortars are more commonly used since 
ancient  times  in  the  construction  (Egyptians,  Chi-
nese, Phoeniciens) (Furlan & Bisseger 1975; Biscon-
tin et al. 2002, Fassina et al. 2002). Conventionally, 
two  types  of  lime  are  used  as  mortars  (i)  non-
hydraulic  lime  (also  called  hydrated  lime)  made 
from relatively pure limestones which mainly harden 
due  to  carbonation  and  (ii)  natural  hydraulic  lime 
made  from  limestone  with  reactive  silica  and  alu-
minium impurities which harden and set in the pres-
ence of water.  
This paper presents the behaviour of lime and exam-
ines  their  compatibility  with  the  tuffeau,  which  is  a 
typical porous limestone which is available plentiful 
in the Loire Valley (France). The prepared mortar is 
composed with non-hydraulic or hydraulic limes and 
aggregates (powder) obtained from the stone tuffeau. 
Mortars  prepared  using  the  same  material  (i.e.,  tuf-
feau) will have similar physico-chemical and hydro-

mechanical properties and compatible with those of 
the tuffeau stone. Mechanical behavioural properties 
(strength properties in compression and tension) and 
hydraulic  property  (mainly  capillary  imbibition) 
were  evaluated  for  mortar  samples  composed  with 
different proportions of lime.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
2.1  Mineralogical  and  textural  characterisation  of 

the building stone 

The  Tuffeau  stone  used  in  the  study  is  a  porous 
sedimentary  white  limestone  (Table  1).  The  princi-
pal minerals present in it are calcite (CaCO3) and sil-
ica  (SiO2)  in  the  form  of  opal  cristobalite-tridymite 
and  quartz.  The  other  minerals  present  in  the  stone 
are micas, clays and detritic minerals such as TiO2. 
The texture of stones forms complex porous network 
(Beck  et  al.,  2003).  The  arrangement  of  larger  and 
smaller  grains  within  the  stones  contributes  to 
macropores  and  micropores  within  the  stone  struc-
ture.

2.2 Mortar components characterisation 
 
The mortar is composed of Tuffeau limestone pow-
der and lime. The powder of Tuffeau is obtained by 
crushing  of  the  stone  in  a  grinder-mixture  followed 
by  sifting  to  achieve  a  fine  powder  by  passing 
through  a  sieve  of  315  µm  diameter.  The  hydraulic 
and  non-hydraulic  lime  powders  that  are  used  are 
light and have low densities. Figure 2 shows the par-
ticle  size  distributions  obtained  from  laser  granu-
lometry of Tuffeau powder of the two limes used in 
this study. From this figure it can be seen that Tuf-
feau  particles  are  fine  and  well  graded.  Hydraulic 
lime particles are very close to that of Tuffeau. Non-
hydraulic  lime  particles  are  less  than  50  µm  in  size 
and are smaller than Tuffeau particles. However, the 
dimensions of all particles that are used in the prepa-
ration  of  the  mortar  are  relatively  small  with  sizes 
ranging between 1 to 100 µm.

2.3 Mortar preparation 
 
The  test  specimens  of  mortar  consisted  of  only  two 
components: powder of Tuffeau and lime (hydraulic 
and  non-hydraulic  lime).  The  effect  of  varying  the 
concentration  of  lime  (i.e.  5  –  50%)  in  the  mortar 
paste  was  studied.  Water  content  of  the  mortar 
pastes was set at 50% so that the mortar paste would 
have  a  good  workable  consistency  no  matter  what 
the  concentration  of  lime.  Two  different  types  of 
samples  were  prepared.  In  the  first  set,  prepared 
samples are 80 mm in height and 40 mm in diame-
ter. They were compacted in a cylindrical cast of 40 
mm  in  diameter  under  a  specific  load  in  order  to 
achieve desired dry bulk density at 1.2 g/cm3 (close 
to that of the stone) and allowed to set for two days. 
The specimens were then remoulded and placed in a 
hermitic chamber at a relative humidity of 100% and 
constant  temperature  of  20°C  for  25  more  days  in 
order to avoid desaturation phenomena. And finally, 
they were dried in an oven at 105°C for a period of 

24  hours.  For  this  reason,  the  specimens  were  al-
lowed to harden for 28 days before being tested. 
In  the  second  series  (used  only  for  the  adhesion 
tests)  a  mortar  of  10  mm  of  thickness  is  placed  on 
cylindrical  stone  sample  (diameter:  40  mm  and 
height: 35 mm) without compaction. During setting, 
the  mixture  of  stone/mortar  is  placed  in  a  bag  and 
sealed  for  a  period  of  7  days  in  order  to  prevent 
evaporation. Then, samples are unpacked and kept in 
a  desiccator  (at  76%  relative  humidity  and  20°C 
temperature) for a period of 21 days before testing. 
 

 

2.4 Mechanical tests 
 
A number of mechanical tests (Beck & Al-Mukhtar, 
2006)  were  carried  out  (Fig.  3)  on  cylindrical  sam-
ples  of  mortar  which  include:  compressive  strength 
(Standard  AFNOR  P94-420)  and  tensile  strength 
called  also  as  cylinder  splitting  test  (Standard  AF-
NOR  P94-422).  In  addition  adhesion  test  (Standard 
AFNOR  NF  EN  1015-12)  was  conducted  on  the 
mortar  paste  placed  on  cylindrical  stone  sample 
without  compaction.  An  increasing  force  is  applied 
at  a  loading  rate  of  0.05  mm/min  for  compressive 
and tensile tests. The samples were loaded at a rate 
of  0.5  MPa/min  using  an  Instron  4485  press  to  de-
termine  the  rupture  in  the  tested  samples  (adhesive 
test). 
The  volumetric  deformation  behaviour  of  the  sam-
ples  was  also  determined.  The  reduction  in  volume 
of initial saturated samples when subjected to a rela-
tive humidity of 32% (humidity induced by using a 
saturated  salt  solution  in  a  desiccator’s)  was  deter-
mined.  These  tests  are  referred  as  “preliminary 
shrinkage tests” in a later section in the paper. This 
terminology was used as authors feel that more test-
ing is required in this direction.

hesive tests respectively  

 

  

 

 

2.5 Water absorption-imbibition test  
 
In  this  test  (standard  AFNOR  B10-613),  previously 
dried  cylindrical  samples  are  placed  in  a  hermetic 
tank  at  the  bottom  of  which  distilled  water  level  is 

maintained  constant  during  entire  period  of  the  test 
(Fig. 4). The mass of wet samples and the height of 
the  capillary  front  are  measured  at  increasing  inter-
vals  of  times.  The  imbibition  coefficients  A  and  B 
correspond  to  the  slopes  of  the  curves  of  mass  up-
take  and  rise  of  the  capillary  front  according  to  the 
square root of elapsed time.

4. RESULTS 
 
4.1 Compressibility of the mortar 
 
One dimensional compression tests (oedometer tests 
–  Fig.  5)  were  performed  on  mortar  pastes  (lateral 
deformation  are  prevented  during  the  test)  to  deter-
mine  its  compressibility  behaviour  under  drained 
conditions. The mortar paste was prepared using the 
different concentrations of lime at a solid/liquid ratio 
of  1:1.  The  duration  of  this  test  is  about  2-3  hours 
which is much lower than the initial setting time of 
the tested paste (> 10 hours). The sample pastes are 
placed  in  65  mm  diameter  oedometer  specimen 
rings.  The  axial  stress  is  applied  and  is  maintained 
until axial strain stabilizes. At the end of the loading, 
the height of sample is measured and dry bulk den-
sity  and  porosity  are  determined  from  the  initial 
properties of the test specimen.  
Results are presented in terms of void ratio (e) ver-
sus axial applied stresses (Fig. 5). The results dem-
onstrate  that  the  void  ratio  reduces  as  the  axial 
stresses are increased. During unloading, the void ra-
tio increases but does not go back to its initial value. 
The hysteretic behaviour demonstrates that the mate-
rial is not elastic but elasto-plastic and each action of 
loading  affects  the  structure  of  the  mortar  perma-
nently. The compression index, Cc is defined as the 
changes  in  void  ratio  (∆e)  per  logarithmic  cycle  of 
axial vertical stress (σv):

∆−
(log v

Results indicate (table 2) that the hydraulic and non-
hydraulic lime based mortar compression index val-
ues  are  similar  for  all  tested  proportions  of  lime  in 
the  mortar.  In  other  words,  the  effect  of  different 
percentages  of  lime  is  negligible  on  the  compressi-
bility  behaviour  of  the  mortar.  Such  behaviour  can 
be  explained  by  the  difference  in  the  particle  size 
distribution of the two limes and Tuffeau grain pow-
ders. 

In  order  to  ensure  a  similar  hydraulic  behaviour 
between mortar and tuffeau stone, samples are com-
pacted  to  dry  bulk  density  close  to  that  of  tuffeau 
(i.e. 1.2 g/cm3). Table 3 presents the porosity of past 
mortar  samples  compacted  at  this  density.  Porosity 
values are determined from void ratio values as:

The mechanical behaviour of mortar specimens was 
examined by comparing tests results of compressive 
strength,  tensile  strength  and  adhesive  strength.  For 
tuffeau  stone  at  the  dry  state,  the  compressive 
strength  is  12  MPa  and  the  tensile  strength  is  1.5 
MPa.  Compressive  strength  results  as  presented  in 
Figure  6  increases  with  the  lime  concentration. 
Meanwhile, mortar samples prepared with hydraulic 
lime  have  higher  mechanical  strength  than  mortars 
prepared  with  non-hydraulic  lime.  Tensile  strength 
results as presented in Figure 7. Mortars are weaker 
in  tension  than  in  compression:  tensile  strength  is 
less  than  one  tenth  of  compressive  strength.  How-
ever, the rate of increase of strength in compressive 
strength is much higher in comparison to the tensile 
strength. The reaction of hydraulic lime with tuffeau 
powder is quicker than that non-hydraulic lime. The 
non-hydraulic  lime  based  mortar  set  is  realized  by 
pozzolanic  reation  with  stone  aggregates  (clayey 
minerals)  and  also  by  carbonisation  reaction  with 
CO2  from  air.  This  reaction  is  very  slow  and  may 
need  several  months  to  achieve  an  equivalent 
strength to that of hydraulic lime. 
For  the  adhesive  strength,  results  obtained  after  28 
days  of  curing  (Table  4)  shows  that  adhesive 
strength  increases  as  lime  percentage  increases. 
These  values  can  be  considered  as  acceptable  for 
lime based mortar (Bromblet, 2000). 
Figure 8 shows preliminary test results of shrinkage 
tests.  The  test  results  suggest  volumetric  deforma-
tion  variations  stabilise  practically  within  2  weeks 
for all tested mortars. The volumetric variations de-
termined  were  less  than  10  %  in  samples  prepared 
with  hydraulic  and  non-hydraulic  lime.  Changes  in 
the  behaviour  due  to  the  continuous  reaction  be-
tween  lime  and  aggregates  (tuffeau  powder)  oc-
curred  without  changes  in  water  content  after  2 
weeks of curing.  
These  tests  have  been  carried  out  on  few  samples 
and  so  more  samples  must  be  tested  to  identify  the 
exact  difference  in  the  behaviour  between  the  two 
tested  limes.  Furthermore,  based  on  the  mechanical 
behaviour  results,  lime  mortars  must  have  a  lime 
concentration of at least 20% to be effective, but it is 
important to note that mechanical parameters will be 
improved with time (Lanas and Alvarez, 2003).

Water  transfer  tests  by  capillary  absorption  meas-
urements  were  performed  on  each  of  the  test  sam-
ples  before  mechanical  strength  tests  were  deter-
mined.  Figure  9  shows  imbibition  coefficient  of 
mass uptake (A) and capillary ascent (B) for differ-
ent tested mortars. For tuffeau stone imbibition coef-
ficient  are:  A=0.36  (g/cm2/min1/2)  and  B=0.96 
(cm/min1/2). The main observations are: 
- imbibition  coefficients  for  mortars  prepared  with 
low lime concentrations are close to that of Tuffeau, 
- little  difference  between  hydraulic  and  non-
hydraulic lime mortars mainly for lime ≥ 15%. 
Irrespective of the lime contents, the total porosity of 
different  prepared  mortars  was  found  to  be  higher 
than the total porosity of tuffeau stone.  The differ-
ence  in  the  imbibition  results  can  mainly  be  attrib-
uted to the pore size distribution. This behaviour in-
dicates  clearly 
that  capillary  water  absorption 
properties in a porous material are directly related to 
the  pore  network  characteristics:  pore  sizes  and 
shapes.  In  addition,  the  following  observations  can 
be  summarized  based  on  comparing  imbibition  test 
results to mechanical test results: 
-  to  approach  the  mechanical  strength  of  tuffeau, 

mortars must have high lime content ≥ 20% 

-  to  approach  the  hydraulic  behaviour  (imbibition, 
characteristics of Tuffeau), mortars must have low 
lime content ≤ 20%. 

The  contradictory  behaviour  observed  in  this  study 
can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  measurement  are 
carried out only after 28 days. It is well known that 
the  reaction  between  lime  and  clayey  minerals  oc-
curs  over  a  long  period  of  time.  For  this  reason,  it 
can be stated with certain degree of confidence that 
the mechanical strength will be improved with time.  
The  research  studies  summarized  in  this  paper  sug-
gest  that  lime  percentage  about  20%  can  be  suffi-
cient and compatible to tuffeau stone.

5. CONCLUSION 
 
The durability characteristics both in construction or 
restoration  of  monuments  are  dependent  on  the  use 
of proper mortar. Results obtained and several stud-
ies  reported  in  the  literature  (Al-Saad  &  Abdel-
Halim 2001; Degryse et al. 2002; Binda et al. 2003; 
Henriques 2005) suggest that the following parame-
ters  must  be  considered  in  a  mortar-stone  compati-
bility  study:  chemical,  mechanical  and  hydraulic 
properties.  It  is  more  practical  to  propose  a  lime 
based  mortar  with  aggregates  originated  from  the 
limestone in order to have an excellent compatibility 
with the chemical properties. The study suggests that 
mortar  seems  to  have  similar  mechanical  strength 
properties  and  is  found  to  be  compatible  to  that  of 
tuffeau  stone  mainly  if  lime-aggregate  reaction  is 
taken  into  consideration  over  a  longer  period  of 
time. The hydraulic properties need to be further in-
vestigated more mainly with respect to permeability 
and diffusion variations. However, imbibition results 
indicate  mortars  using  low  percentages  of  lime  (≤ 
20%) are compatible with tuffeau.  
Moreover, this study demonstrates clearly that there 
is no difference in the behaviour of the mortar com-
posed of hydraulic or non-hydraulic lime. However, 
these tests have been carried out on few samples and 
so more samples must be tested to for better under-
standing of differences in the behaviour between the 
two tested limes. Microscopic observation and mer-
cury porosimetry investigation studies are necessary 
for  different  samples  of  mortar  in  order  to  follow 
and to compare the microstructure and the pore size 
distribution changes with lime type and proportion.  
Furthermore,  aging  tests  including  thermo-hydro-
mechanical  cycles  under  real  environmental  condi-
tions are necessary to evaluate the performance (de-
terioration and durability) of the proposed mortar in 
order  to  confirm  the  compatibility  of  the  conceived 
mortar  (based  on  hydraulic  or  non-hydraulic)  with 
the tuffeau.

Abstract 
Metamaterials—artificially  structured  materials  with  tailored  electromagnetic  response—can  be 
designed to have properties difficult to achieve with existing materials.  Here we present a structured 
metamaterial,  based  on  conducting  split  ring  resonators  (SRRs),  which  has  an  effective  index-of-
refraction with a constant spatial gradient.  We experimentally confirm the gradient by measuring the 
deflection of a microwave beam by a planar slab of the composite metamaterial over a broad range of 
frequencies.  The gradient index metamaterial represents an alternative approach to the development of 
gradient index lenses and similar optics that may be advantageous, especially at higher frequencies. In 
particular, the gradient index material we propose may be suited for terahertz applications, where the 
magnetic resonant response of SRRs has recently been demonstrated.

There  have  now  been  several  demonstrations  in  which 
previously 
electromagnetic  material 
unobserved or otherwise difficult to achieve in conventional 
materials—has  been  obtained 
in  artificially  structured 
materials [1-4].  These recent demonstrations have shown the 
to  as 
potential  of  artificial  materials,  often  referred 
metamaterials,  to  significantly  extend  the  range  of  material 
properties, enabling the potential for new physical and optical 
behavior, as well as unique electromagnetic devices. 

An  example  of  unusual  metamaterial  response  can  be 
found  in  negative  index  metamaterials,  which  possess 
simultaneously negative permittivity (ε) and permittivity (µ) 
over  a  finite  frequency  band.    The  fundamental  nature  of 
negative refraction, hypothesized in 1968 by V. G. Veselago 
[5], has revealed the key role that metamaterials can play in 
materials physics, as negative index is a material property not 
available in existing materials. 

The negative index metamaterials thus far demonstrated 
have  been  formed  from  periodic  arrays  of  conducting 
elements,  the  size  and  spacing  of  which  are  much  less  than 
the  wavelengths  of  interest.    The  shape  of  the  repeated 
conducting element determines the electromagnetic response 
of  the  collective,  which  can  be  approximated  as  having  an 
electric  [6]  or  a  magnetic  [7,  8]  resonance.    Application  of 
effective medium theory to the overall periodically patterned 
composite  allows  a  description  in  terms  of  bulk  isotropic  or 
anisotropic ε and µ. 

The  split  ring  resonator  (SRR),  shown  in  the  insets  to 
Fig. 1, has become commonplace as the repeated element in 
metamaterials that exhibit magnetic properties. A single SRR 
responds to electromagnetic fields in a manner analogous to a 
magnetic  “atom,”  exhibiting  a  resonant  magnetic  dipolar 
response.    A  medium  composed  of  periodically  positioned 
SRRs  can  be  approximately  characterized  by  the  following 
frequency dependent permeability µ:

SRR medium also exhibits an effective permittivity, ε, which 
has  been  shown  to  also  be  dispersive  as  a  function  of

frequency  [9].  However,  this  frequency  dependent  behavior 
is  minor  at  frequencies  far  away  from  the  resonance,  and 
approaches a constant in the limit of small cell size; thus, we 
approximate  here 
the  permittivity  as  a  constant  over 
frequency.  In addition, the orientation of the SRR relative to 
the  field  polarization  used  implies  that  the  electric  and 
magnetic responses are decoupled [10, 11]. 

In  the  recent  work  to  date,  metamaterials  have  been 
constructed  from  repeated  unit  cells  containing  identical 
elements,  such  that  the  resulting  medium  can  be  considered 
homogeneous in the sense that the averaged electromagnetic 
response  does  not  vary  over  the  structure.    However, 
metamaterials  whose  averaged  electromagnetic  properties 
vary  as  a  function  of  position  can  also  be  fabricated.    Such 
spatially dispersive materials are of interest, for example, as 
they  can  be  utilized  in  a  variety  of  applications,  including 
lensing  and  filtering.  Here  we  present  a  metamaterial  based 
on  SRRs,  in  which  a  pattern  of  spatial  dispersion  can  be 
introduced  by  a  slight  change  in  the  properties  of  each 
successive  element  along  a  direction  perpendicular  to  the 
direction  of  propagation.    We  thus  form  a  constant  gradient 
index along this axis of the metamaterial, which we confirm 
by beam deflection experiments. 
While  an  SRR  medium 

to  have  a 
predominantly magnetic response, this is not of direct interest 
here; rather, we are concerned with the refractive index n(ω)

with µ(ω) given by Eq. 1 and ε(ω) approximated as constant.  
This  form  of  the  dispersion,  ω=ck/n(ω),  can  be  compared 
with  that  obtained  from  a  numerical  solution  of  Maxwell’s 
equations  for  a  single  unit  cell.    To  obtain  the  dispersion 
diagram numerically, we compute the eigenfrequencies for a 
single  unit  cell  (Fig.  1,  inset),  applying  periodic  boundary 
conditions  with  zero  phase  advance 
in  directions 
perpendicular  to  the  propagation  direction,  and  periodic 
boundary  conditions  with  various  phase  advances  in  the 
propagation direction.    The simulations  are  performed  using 
HFSS  (Ansoft),  a  finite-element  based  electromagnetic 
solver.    The  resulting  dispersion  diagram,  shown  as  the 
frequency  versus  the  phase  advance  φ  across  a  unit  cell

Specifically,  there  are  two  branches  of  propagating  modes 
separated by a frequency band gap.  The lower branch starts 
at  zero  frequency  and  ends  at  ωr  with  a  phase  advance  of 
frequency

The  resonant  frequency  of  an  SRR,  ωr,  depends  rather 
sensitively on the geometrical parameters and local dielectric 
environment  for  the  SRR  [7].    Since  µ(ω)  depends  strongly 
on  ωr  (Eq.  1),  we  see  that  relatively  small  changes  to  the 
basic  repeated  unit  cell  can  result  in  substantial  changes  to 
the  permeability  of  the  composite,  especially  near  the 

resonance.  The change in index

frequencies  (ω<<ωr)  the  index  changes  linearly  with  small

Assuming  ∆ωr/ωr<<1  and  ignoring  higher  order  terms,  we 
see  that,  for  the  model  system  described  by  Eq.  1,  the 
gradient  increases  as  the  square  of  the  frequency  for  ω<<ωr 
and  decreases  as  the  inverse  of  the  square  of  the  frequency 
for ω>>ωr.    

There  are  a  variety  of  modifications  to  the  SRR  or  its 
environment  that  can  be  used  to  introduce  a  variation  in ωr.  
The method we apply here is to adjust the depth of cut of the 
dielectric  substrate  material  surrounding  the  SRR.    This 
method  is  compatible  with  our  sample  fabrication,  in  which 
SRRs  are  patterned  on  copper  clad  circuit  boards  using  a 
numerically  controlled  micromilling  machine.    The  removal 
of dielectric material from the region near the SRR (ε~3.8 for 
FR4  circuit  board)  changes  the  local  dielectric  environment 
of the SRR, effecting a change in the resonance frequency.   

In  Fig.  1  we  present  several  dispersion  curves 
corresponding  to  SRR  composites  for  various  depths  of 
substrate  material  around  the  SRR.    The  depth  of  substrate 
differs by 6 µm between successive dispersion curves.  Fig. 1 
and 
shows 
monotonically  with  increasing  depth  of  cut,  up  to  36  µ  in 
depth.    Further  simulations,  as  well  as  the  experimental 
results shown later, show the approximate linearity is valid to 
240 µm.

shifts 

Because  the  SRR  exhibits  a  resonant  frequency  ωr  that 
increases linearly as a function of the substrate cut depth, it is 
a convenient element from which to design a gradient index 
metamaterial.    In  particular,  if  we  form  a  metamaterial 
comprising a linear array of SRRs in which the substrate cut 
depth advances linearly as a function of cell number, ωr will 
then also advance linearly as a function of cell number; that 
is,  ωr  becomes  linearly  proportional  to  distance.    Using  this 
relationship  in  Eqs.  2  and  3,  we  see  that  the  gradient  of  the 
index  will  thus  be  approximately  constant  as  a  function  of 
distance, at least for frequencies far enough away from ωr.   

A constant gradient metamaterial can be experimentally 
confirmed by observing the deflection of a beam incident on 
a  planar  metamaterial  slab  whose  index  varies  linearly  (in  a 
direction  perpendicular  to  incident  radiation).    To  calculate 
this deflection, we consider two normally incident but offset 
rays  entering  a  gradient  index  planar  slab  of  thickness  t,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  2.    The  rays  will  acquire  different  phase 
advances as they propagate through the slab.  Assuming the 
two  rays  enter  at  locations  x  and  x+∆x  along  the  slab  face,

which  shows  that  for  a  material  with  a  constant  spatial 
gradient  in  index,  the  beam  is  uniformly  deflected.    Here, 
δ(x)  is  the  depth  of  cut  as  a  function  of  distance  along  the 
slab.  This simplified analysis applies strictly to thin samples, 
as the phase fronts will otherwise not be uniform within the 
material.    Note  that  Φ(x)  is  the  phase  shift  across  a  slab  of 
arbitrary  thickness.    If  the  slab  is  one  unit  cell  in  thickness, 
then  for  the  SRR  cell  the  phase  shift  will  be  φ  as  defined 
earlier. 

In  order

index 
metamaterial,  the  above  analysis  suggests  that  we  form  a 
linear  array  of  SRRs,  in  which  the  substrate  depth  is  a 
linearly  increasing  function  of  cell  number  in  the  direction 
perpendicular to the propagation.  The resulting array should 
then  deflect  an  incident  beam  by  an  angle  that  can  be 
predicted by the dispersion diagrams in Fig. 1.  To estimate 
this  angle  of  deflection,  we  can  take  the  difference  between 
any  two  of  the  curves  in  Fig.  1  to  find  the  gradient  of  the 
phase  shift  per  unit  cell.    The  phase  shift  per  unit  cell  is 
equivalent to the beam deflection that will be produced by a 
gradient  index  metamaterial  slab  one  unit  cell  thick  in  the 
propagation direction.  The resulting plot of deflection angle 
as  a  function  of  frequency,  obtained  from  the  dispersion 
curves in Fig. 1, is shown in Fig. 3. 

 

The curves in Fig. 3 are useful for calculating deflection 
angles  only  for  frequencies  where  the  gradient  is  constant, 
which  can  be  determined,  for  example,  by  analyzing  the 
differences  between  several  of  the  dispersion  curves  of  Fig. 
1.  Furthermore, near the resonant frequency on the low side, 
the  absorption  resonance  leads  to  a  region  of  anomalous 
dispersion  where  the  simulation  results  (which  do  not  take 
into  account 
  An  additional 
complicating factor is that the analyzed structure is periodic, 
so that higher order bands exist at frequencies greater than ωr 
that are not described by Eq. 1.  Nevertheless, Fig. 3 provides 
an indication that at frequencies above the band gap, per unit 
cell phase shifts of one degree or more should be obtainable 
from  an  SRR  slab, one  unit cell  in  thickness,  in which  each 
successive cell has an additional 6 µm of substrate dielectric 
removed relative to the previous cell.

To fabricate the gradient index metamaterial samples, we

metamaterials  are  composed  of  roughly  forty  strips  spaced 
one unit cell apart, each strip having the substrate milled to a 
different depth.  The resonance frequency of each SRR strip 
is  measured  in  an  angular  resolved  microwave  spectrometer 
(ARMS) described previously [13].  The measured resonance 
frequencies of each strip versus the depth of cut are plotted in 
Fig.  4,  where  the  linearity  of  the  fabrication  process  is 
confirmed.    The  nominal  difference  in  substrate  thickness 
between  subsequent  milling  passes  was  6  µm.    Note  that  at 
two  depths  there  are  breaks  from  the  linearity;  these 
deviations  from  linearity  coincide  with  tool  bit  changes  on 
the  milling  machine,  indicating  some  lack of reproducibility 
in  repositioning  the  mill  at  the  nominal  zero  cut  depth 
position.    The  resulting  linearity,  however,  proved  to  be 
sufficient for the deflection experiment.

The  composite  gradient  index  samples  are  measured  in 
the ARMS apparatus.  To confirm the gradient in the sample, 
a  microwave beam is directed normally onto the face of the 
sample (as in Fig. 2), and the power detected as a function of 
angle at a radius 40 cm away.  As in previous measurements 
on  metamaterial  samples,  the  experiment  is  carried  out  in  a 
planar waveguide—an effectively two-dimensional geometry 
in  which  the  electric  field  is  polarized  between  two 
conducting (aluminum) plates [13]. 
 

The  curves  correspond  to  the  gradient  determined  from  Fig. 
3,  while  the  open  and  black  circles  are  measured  points.    A 
frequency  translation  was  applied  to  the  dispersion  curve  to 
make  the  calculated  band  gap  coincident  with  the  band  gap 
measured  in  the  actual  structure;  no  other  fitting  or 
adjustments  were  performed.    The  excellent  agreement 
shown  in  Fig.  6  attests  to  the  precision  of  the  fabrication 
process, as illustrated in Fig. 4.  The agreement also provides 
important  evidence  that  even  a  single  unit  cell  can  be 
described as having a well-defined refractive index, since the 
interpretation of this effect depends on a refractive index that 
varies controllably from cell-to-cell within the structure.

In  Fig.  5,  we  present  a  map  of  the  transmitted  power 
versus  angle  of  detection,  as  a  function  of  the  frequency  of 
the incident microwave beam.  Two samples are compared in 
the figure: Fig. 5a shows a control sample consisting of a five 
cell  deep  SRR  metamaterial,  where  each  SRR  strip  is 
identical  (no  gradient). 
  The  plot  in  Fig.  5a  shows 
transmission at frequencies corresponding to pass bands, and 
a frequency region of attenuation corresponding to where the 
permeability is negative.  As can be seen from the figure, the

microwave  beam  exits 
centered about zero degrees. 

In Fig. 5b, we present the results of a measurement on an 
eight  cell  thick  (in  propagation  direction)  gradient  index 
sample, formed by combining the three and five cell samples 
together.    The  angular  deviation  is  evident  in  the  figure, 
especially at the high frequency side of the gap region, where 
a  characteristic  tail  can  be  seen  in  agreement  with  that 
predicted in Fig. 3.  The qualitative aspects of the curve are 
in  agreement  with  the  theory  and  simulations  above,  except 
that  there  is  weaker  evidence  of  deflection  on  the  low-
frequency side of the gap.  This lack of symmetry, however, 
is  expected,  as  the  lower  frequency  side  corresponds  to  the 
resonance, where the absorption (neglected in the dispersion 
diagrams) is strongest.   

A  detailed  comparison  of  the  measured  and  calculated 
angle  of  deflection  versus  frequency  is  shown  in  Fig.  6  for 
the  four  and  eight  cell  thick  gradient  index  metamaterials.

introduced that has the effect of uniformly deflecting a beam

work  with  the  SRR  system,  as  the  properties  of  SRRs  are 
now well established.  In particular, the resonance frequency

Frequency (GHz)

Fig.  6.  Measured  angle  of  deflection  (black  circles)  of  a 
gradient  index  SRR  slab,  eight  unit  cells  in  thickness.    The 
gray  curves  are  taken  from  those  shown  in  Fig.  3,  but  have 
been  translated  in  frequency  so  that  the  calculated  and  the 
measured band gap regions overlap. 
 
 

the  gradient 

An  evident  application  of 

index 
metamaterial  is  in  gradient  index  lenses.    A  parabolic  (as 
opposed  to  linear)  distribution  of  index  in  the  slab  along  an 
axis  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  wave  propagation 
results  in  a  structure  that  focuses  radiation  rather  than 
deflecting it [14]. Common examples of such gradient index 
lenses include radial gradient index rod lenses, used at optical 
frequencies,  and  Luneberg 
lenses,  used  at  microwave 
frequencies.    Gradient  index  rod  lenses  use  optical  glass 
materials  that  are  ion  doped  via  thermal  diffusion.    This 
process can produce only modest variations of the refractive 
index, (less than 0.2), and is limited to fairly small diameter 
than  1  cm)  [15].  Luneberg  spherical  or 
rods,  (less 
hemispherical  lenses,  which  require  the  fairly  wide  index 
range  of  n=1  to  n=2,  can  be  implemented  as  stepped  index 
devices  with no  particular  size  limitation  [14].  Both  devices 
employ gradients in the dielectric permittivity only, and thus 
have limited impedance matching to the surrounding media.  
Gradient  index  metamaterials  may  provide  a  useful 
alternative  approach  to  the  development  of  optics.    The 
advantages of both traditional and planar lenses formed from 
for  example,  have  been 
artificially  patterned  media,

Abstract 

 
Following  our  recent  theoretical  development  of  the  concept  of  nano-inductors,  nano-capacitors 
and nano-resistors at optical frequencies and the possibility of synthesizing more complex nano-
scale circuits, here we theoretically investigate in detail the problem of optical nano-transmission-
lines (NTL) that can be envisioned by properly joining together arrays of these basic nano-scale 
circuit  elements.  We  show  how,  in  the  limit  in  which  these  basic  circuit  elements  are  closely 
packed together, the NTLs can be regarded as stacks of plasmonic and non-plasmonic planar slabs, 
which may be designed to effectively exhibit the properties of planar metamaterials with forward 
(right-handed)  or  backward  (left-handed)  operation.  With  the  proper  design,  negative  refraction 
and  left-handed  propagation  are  shown  to  be  possible  in  these  planar  plasmonic  guided-wave 
structures, providing possibilities for sub-wavelength focusing and imaging in planar optics, and 
laterally-confined waveguiding at IR and visible frequencies. The effective material parameters for 
such  NTLs  are  derived,  and  the  connection  and  analogy  between  these  optical  NTLs  and  the 
double-negative  and  double-positive  metamaterials  are  also  explored.  Physical  insights  and 
justification for the results are also presented. 
 

Introduction 
 
Left-handed  metamaterials  (also  known  as  double-negative  (DNG)  media,  in  which  the 
real  parts  of  permittivity  and  permeability  are  both  negative  in  a  given  range  of 
frequencies)  and  single-negative  (SNG)  materials  (with  the  real  part  of  the  permittivity 
negative  (ε-negative,  ENG)  or  of  the  permeability  negative  (µ-negative,  MNG))  offer 
exciting electromagnetic wave propagation properties, with potential applications in the 
design of various devices and components (see e.g., [1]-[7]). The resonance phenomenon 
present at the interface between  a DNG  material  and a  conventional  material (which in 
analogy with the previous terminology we name “double positive”, DPS), and/or between 
ENG  and  MNG  media  [1],  may  be  manifested  in several interesting ways, e.g., in sub-
wavelength focusing and ‘perfect’ lensing [2]. In our recent work, we have also shown 
how the suitable pairing of DNG and DPS materials may overcome the diffraction limit 
in different configurations such as in closed and open waveguides and cavities [4]-[6], or 
in  scattering  and  radiation  from  electrically  small  objects  [7]-[8],  to  name  a  few.  The 
realization  of  DNG  metamaterials,  although  achieved  by  several  groups  (see  e.g.,  [9]), 
requires technological efforts and challenges at the present time. At optical frequencies, 
moreover, the possibility of inducing a negative effective permeability in a bulk material 
is even more challenging [10] and different alternatives have been proposed in the recent 
literature for constructing left-handed metamaterials in the optical regime [11]-[16]. This 
is  why  in  some  of  our  previous  work  (e.g.,  [1],  [4]-[7]),  we  have  investigated  single-
negative  (SNG)  media,  such  as  ENG  plasmonic  material  (e.g.,  noble  metals  at  infrared 
(IR)  and  optical  frequencies,  or  ENG  artificially  engineered  metamaterials  at  lower

frequencies),  some  of  whose  properties  are  somewhat  similar  to  those  of  DNG  media. 
Also  the  technique  we  have  proposed  to  realize  an  effective  µ-negative  material  in  the 
optical regime relies on properly exploited plasmonic resonances  of ENG nanoparticles 
[16].  Moreover,  open  ENG  planar  layers  or  cylinders  supporting  guided  surface  modes 
may  overcome  the  diffraction  limit  in  their  operation  [6],  [17]-[18],  i.e.,  the  more  the 
waveguide’s lateral transverse cross section is reduced, the more the fundamental mode 
remains  concentrated  around  the  waveguide,  implying  in  principle  the  existence  of  a 
/ 2λ  limit, which may hint to the 
mode with lateral cross section below the conventional 
possibility of miniaturization of optical interconnects. 
We have also recently shown theoretically that nano-scale circuit elements such as nano-
inductors and nano-capacitors at optical frequencies can be conceptualized using properly 
designed  plasmonic  (ENG)  and  DPS  nano-particles  small  compared  with  the  operating 
wavelength  [19].  Since  their  dimensions  are  assumed  to  be  electrically  small,  for  the 
spatial distribution of the fields in their vicinities their interaction with light may indeed 
be  treated  as  “quasi-static”  and  it  may  be  interpreted  as  “lumped  circuit  elements”  at 
these  frequencies.  The  role  of  the  conduction  current  in  a  conventional  circuit  is  here 
replaced by the displacement current circulating around and inside the nano-particles. In 
that  work,  we  have  also  speculated  the  possibility  of  designing  more  complex  optical 
nano-scale  circuits  by  combining  together  these  basic  elements  in  series  and  parallel 
configurations. We are currently investigating those issues. 
Our  proposed  use  of  plasmonic  and  non-plasmonic  nanoparticles  as  nano-scale  circuit 
elements naturally leads to the possibility of synthesizing a nano transmission line (NTL) 
at  the  optical  frequencies  when  one  considers  combining  together  the  basic  nano-
inductors  and  nano-capacitors  proposed  in  [19],  as  we  have  anticipated  in  a  recent 
conference  presentation  [20].  As  we  will  show  in  the  following,  this  may  also  provide 
interesting possibilities for the realization of one- and two-dimensional planar negative-
refraction  metamaterials  at optical frequencies. In the present work we will  first briefly 
review  the  concept  of  nano-scale  optical  circuit  elements  in  order  to  introduce  the 
possibility  of  synthesizing  a  right-handed  or  left-handed  NTL  by  placing  in  close 
proximity  DPS  and  plasmonic  nano-particles.  Then,  we  will  show  how  in  the  limit  in 
which these elements are closely packed together, the NTL geometry may evolve into the 
planar open waveguide we have recently analyzed [6]. The analysis of this structure will 
be  presented,  showing  how  the  supported  modes  may  be  either  forward-wave  or 
backward-wave modes, and therefore how these planar layers may synthesize an effective 
right-handed (RH) or left-handed (LH) 2-D planar metamaterial at optical frequencies. It 
is possible therefore to predict negative refraction at the interface between such RH and 
LH 2-D NTL and consequently sub-wavelength focusing due to such negative refraction. 
Extending  this  concept,  we  also  foresee  the  possibility  of  synthesizing  SNG  materials 
with  the  desired  properties  in  similar  geometries,  thus  potentially  obtaining  other 
anomalous properties of the wave interaction with these materials.  The SNG version of 
these structures is currently under study and will be reported in a future publication

and  the  impedance  is  easily  defined  and  measured  as  the  proportionality  constant.  For

,  with  ε  being  the  local  electric  permittivity  and 

lossless  “reactive”  elements  this  quantity  is  purely  imaginary  and  provides  the 
information for the phase advance or delay of the voltage with respect to the current for 
the  inductive  or  capacitive  reactance.  Of  course,  lossy  and  absorbing  passive  elements 
have a positive real part for the impedance, taking into account the dissipated power. At 
optical frequencies, however, “usual” lumped inductors and capacitors are not available, 
since  the  conductivity  of  materials  (particularly  metals)  is  modified  in  these  frequency 
regimes.  In  [19],  however,  we  have  theoretically  proposed  how  a  single  nano-particle, 
small  compared  to  the  operating  wavelength,  may  behave  as  an  equivalent  “lumped” 
circuit  element,  as  seen  from  outside,  provided  we  consider  the  electric  displacement 
0E   the  local 
current  density  (
electric field) as the circulating current in this nano-element and in the space surrounding 
it. In the quasi-static limit, in fact, the “average” voltage across the element and the total 
displacement current induced all over the space satisfy Kirchhoff’s laws and the effective 
impedance of a spherical nano-particle of radius  a  may be defined as [19]: 
 
 
 
Similar  formulas  may  be  derived  for  more  complex  shapes  for  the  nano-particles.  In 
particular, a DPS nano-particle corresponds to a nano-capacitor, since its permittivity is 
positive,  whereas  a  plasmonic  nano-particle  acts  as  a  nano-inductor  as  observed  from 
outside,  due  to  its  negative  permittivity.  We  also  speculated  that  two  closely  packed 
nano-particles,  by  the  same  token,  may  be  regarded  as  in  parallel  (having  the  same 
voltage  applied)  or  in  series  (having  the  same  current)  configuration,  depending  on  the 
orientation  and  polarization  of  the  exciting  field.  It  may  be  straightforward  then  to 
suggest more complex circuits when a system of nano-particles is properly arranged [19]. 
The  circuit  model  of  a  “right-handed  (RH)”  transmission-line  is  well  known  in  the 
electrical  engineering  community,  and  as  depicted  in  Fig.  1  (top  row,  left  column), 
consists  of  the  cascade  of  distributed  series  inductors  and  shunt  capacitors.  This 
schematic  circuit  supports  a  transverse  electromagnetic  (TEM)  wave  with  RH  (i.e., 
forward-wave)  propagation  and  it  represents  a  useful  circuit  model  for  commonly  used 
guiding  structures  at  microwave  and  lower  frequencies  (e.g.,  coaxial  cables  and 
striplines). Interchanging the role of inductors and capacitors, one may synthesize a left-
handed (LH) transmission-line, as depicted in Fig. 1 (top row, right column). This circuit 
supports LH (backward-wave) propagation and this model has been exploited by several 
groups  to  synthesize  2-D  planar  non-resonant  LH  metamaterials  at  microwave 
frequencies [21]-[22] with backward-wave propagation to verify negative refraction and 
sub-wavelength focusing at these frequencies. In the figure (first row) are also depicted 
arrows to show how voltages (V ) and currents ( I ) along the line are defined. Can one 
have  a  similar  structure  at  the  IR  and  optical  frequencies?    If  one  can  consider  nano-
inductors  and  nano-capacitors,  an  analogous  nano-transmission  line  (NTL)  can  be 
synthesized at these frequencies, as we envision here.  
Following the circuit analogy described above, it may be possible to arrange properly the 
nano-particles acting as nano-inductors and nano-capacitors in order to synthesize a NTL 
at  optical  frequencies,  as  sketched  in  Fig.  1  (middle  row).  In  the  figure,  darker  spheres 
represent  DPS  nano-particles  acting  as  nano-capacitors,  whereas  the  lighter  ENG 
particles play the role of nano-inductors. Also in this case an analogous representation for 
voltages  and  currents  is  suggested,  even  though  here  they  symbolize  different,  but 
related,  physical  quantities.  In  the  limit  in  which  such  elements  are  closely  packed 
together, such configurations may eventually resemble stacks of planar layers of DPS and 
plasmonic materials (bottom row in Fig. 1), which correspond to the geometry we have

studied  in  [6]  to  show  the  anomalies  in  the  surface-wave  propagation  when  DNG 
materials are involved. Motivated by these analogies, in the next sections we discuss the 
modal distribution of a stack of planar layers of ENG and DPS materials, showing how it 
is indeed possible to synthesize positive-index and negative-index sub-diffraction optical 
NTL  by  using  such  plasmonic  open  planar  waveguides,  and  how  such  2-D  positive-
index/negative-index  structures  may  be  employed  in  a  similar  way  as  their  double-
positive (DPS) and double-negative (DNG) metamaterial counterparts in order to achieve 
negative  refraction  and  sub-wavelength  focusing.  This  may  open  doors  to  interesting 
potential in imaging, lensing and waveguiding applications at optical and infrared, as well 
as microwave, frequencies. 
 

2-D Planar Nano Transmission Lines 

 
The structures in the last row of Fig. 1 may be envisioned as coaxial cylindrical rods or 
stacked  planar  slabs  of  DPS  and  ENG  materials,  giving  rise  to  1-D  or  2-D  NTL, 
respectively. In the following, we analyze in detail the planar slab configuration, which 
may  be  utilized  to  synthesize  right-handed  (RH)  and  left-handed  (LH)  2-D  NTL,  in 
analogy  with  what  has  been  obtained  at  microwave  frequencies  by  lumped  circuit 
elements  for  construction  of  2-D  planar  metamaterials  [21]-[22].  It  is  also  important  to 
note  that  a  similar  configuration,  although  obtained  following  a  different  train  of 
thoughts, has been envisioned by Shvets in [15] as a first step for constructing a photonic 
band-gap  material  with  negative-refractive  properties  in  optics.  We  will  see  later, 
however, how its operation is different in several aspects from what we present here. 
The geometry we refer to is depicted in Fig. 2 and for simplicity it consists of a planar 
inε ω  and thickness  d  sandwiched between two half-spaces with

in  the  x-z  plane  and  the  materials  considered  are  non-magnetic  i.e.,  their  permeabilities

are in general dependent on frequency.  
Consider first the guided modes of this structure propagating along the  x  direction with a 
i xe β . Due to the symmetry of the structure, the guided modes may be categorized 
factor 
into  even  and  odd  modes  with  respect  to  the  transverse  variation  along  the  y   axis  and 
into  TE  and  TM  modes  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  propagation.  In  this  case, 
therefore, all quantities are independent of  z  variable.

The TE mode equations may be easily obtained by duality. 
When the permittivity of one of the two materials has negative real part (e.g., plasmonic

properties.  First  of  all,  the  fundamental  TM  mode  does  not  have  in  principle  a  cut-off 
thickness: while decreasing the core thickness  d  to sub-wavelength dimensions, still Eq.  
(3)  admits  a  real  solution  for  β  in  the  limit  of  no  losses.  As  was  shown  in  [6]  for  the 
DNG  slab  and  also  similarly  to  the  cylindrical  case  [17]-[18],  the  wave  number  β 
increases  as  d   decreases,  causing  concentration  of  the  guided  field  distribution around 
  (as  can  be  implied  from  Eq.  (2)  when  the  slab  thickness 
the  two  interfaces 
reduces.  (Of  course,  a  physical/practical  limit  may  still  hold,  since  such  a  slow  mode, 
concentrated in an electrically small cross section, would be highly sensitive to the ohmic 
losses  present  in  any  realistic  material.)  Neglecting  material  losses  for  the  moment  and

exciting this mode, an observer would see part of the power taken from the source in one 
of  the  two  regions  flowing  back  to  the  source  in  the  other  region,  with  no  transverse 
exchange  of  power  between  the  two  fluxes  in  the  steady-state  scenario.  However,  as 
discussed in [6], [23] for the case of closed waveguides partially filled with SNG or DNG 
materials  with  similar  properties,  this  does  not  present  any  problem  for  causality,  since 
this  anomalous  feature  is  explained  and  justified  by  considering  the  reflection  of  the 
mode at any discontinuity in a realistic finite structure (The reader is referred to [6], [23] 
for a more detailed explanation of the phenomenon). 
For positive  β when we get 
netP >  the corresponding mode is a forward mode, since 
its phase velocity is parallel with the net-power flow (and thus with its group velocity); if 
netP < ,  we  are  dealing  with  a  backward  mode,  with  anti-parallel  phase  and 
instead 
group  velocities.  The  special  case  of 
0
  and  zero  group  velocity, 
netP = ,  i.e., 
would correspond to an anomalous resonating mode with non-zero phase velocity, similar 
to what we have already found in [5]-[6], [23]. As we will show later, however, this case

conducting wires running along

odd configuration would behave in a dual way, as evident from Eq. (6). This is consistent 
with  what  discussed  by  Shvets  in  [15]  for  the  plasmonic-air-plasmonic  waveguide 
supporting an odd backward mode. 
Fig. 4 shows the field distribution, for a RH (i.e., positive-index) (on the left) and a LH 
(i.e., negative-index) (on the right) NTL, designed to have the same thickness for the core

slab,  which  is 
important  when  we  want  to  cascade  and  match  an  RH  with  an  LH  NTL,  as  we  will 
discuss  in  the  next  section.)  The  RH  NTL  is  formed  with  an  ENG  cladding  with

We  emphasize  again  how  the  field  distributions  may  somehow  “resemble”  those  of  a 
standard  TL,  with  “currents”  concentrated  in  the  region  near  the  two  interfaces.  Note, 
however, how the “currents” are now distributed in the space, and by decreasing the core 
thickness  d  the effective region they occupy becomes proportionally narrower (the fact 
that  β  and  d   are  inversely  proportional  as  in  Eq.  (4)  ensures  that  a  scaling  in  the 
structure  corresponds  to  an  anomalous  scaling  in  the  transverse  field  distribution). 
Consistent  with  our  circuit  analogy,  these  “currents”  may  now  be  represented  by  the 
integral of the displacement current 
 around the two interfaces. They are indeed 
x
oppositely  oriented  for  the  two  interfaces,  as  it  is  the  case  in  a  standard  TL.  (We  note, 
however, that in this case each of the two currents actually consists of two opposite fluxes 
running around each of the two interfaces, similar to what we have already discussed for 
the  power  flow.)  Applying  Ampere’s  law,  the  integral  sum  of  these  distributed 
displacement currents around each interface has the value:

(Note that this current has the unit of A/m, since this is a current per unit length of the 
structure in the z direction.) The phase velocity of the modes is much slower than that of 
a plane wave in free space, since 
 in these sub-wavelength structures. As

the  core  slab  thickness  decreases,  this  velocity  is  also  reduced  and  the  fields  become 
more concentrated around the interfaces. 
In  order  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  dispersion  in  these 
waveguides, we should take into account the frequency dependence of the ENG material 
permittivity. We use here the Drude model (including realistic losses) for silver in the IR 
and visible bands (e.g., [25]), which has a good agreement with experimentally-derived 
permittivity for silver from 30 to 900 THz (spanning the IR and visible frequencies), in 
order  to  evaluate  the  variation  of  β  with  the  frequency 
  in  a  realistic

the power is in fact reactive in this limit, and the Q factor for this resonance is very high. 
This is also seen in the plots of Fig. 5, since a vertical slope for the curve indicates a zero 
group velocity, and indeed Eq. (6) yields 
ε= − . (In the plot here, due

is not a real asymptote. However, since here the losses are moderate, the situation is very 
similar to the ideal lossless limit as soon as we move away from the resonance peak.) 
As  the  frequency  is  increased  further,  we  enter  Fig.  5b,  where  backward  operation  is 
achieved.  In  this  regime,  the  SiO2-Ag-SiO2  waveguide  operates  in  its  left-handed  (i.e., 
backward)  even  mode,  as  predicted  in  Fig.  1b,  whereas  the  dual  geometry  has  its 
backward operation with an odd mode (which corresponds to the case analyzed in [15]).

start to interact around 

SiOω ε μ  (the light-line indicated in Fig. 5b).  The even mode 
will no longer be guided inside the ENG core and may lose its guiding properties. This is 
noticeable in Fig. 5b for the LH NTL, where the slope of the solid line around 880 THz 
has  a  drastic  change.  At  this  frequency,  the  forward  mode  begins  to  interfere  with  the 
backward  mode  we  are  interested,  and  this  produces  an  effect  in  the  dispersion  of  the 
backward mode, which is no longer properly guiding the energy, as confirmed in the next 
Fig. 6b by a sudden increase in its damping factor. Note that around 920 THz, the mode 
also starts to leak out energy, since the dispersion line crosses the light line, resulting in 
the increase of the damping factor in Fig. 6b. 
In  Fig.  6,  the  corresponding  imaginary  part  of  β,  representing  the  damping  factor  for 
these  modes,  which  is  due  to  the  material  losses  in  the  plasmonic  material,  is  reported. 
We point out that in this figure the sign of  Imβ is positive for the forward modes and 
negative  for  the  backward  modes,  since  in  Fig.  5  we  always  considered  solutions  with 
positive  Reβ in the  x+  direction (and therefore for the backward case, one should have 
a power flow in the opposite direction (i.e.,  x−  direction), implying that in the presence 
of loss the power flux decays in  x−  direction, thus “grows” in the  x+ , hence the sign of 
Imβ). Considering that we have utilized realistic values for material losses and that the 
cross  section  of  the  guided  beam  is  very  small  (the  core  thickness  is  just  14  nm),  this 
example  shows  that  highly  confined  guided  modes  can  propagate  along  this  structure 
without  diffraction  for  some  noticeable  distance  both  in  the  even  and  odd  mode  of 
operation. It is interesting to note that the losses increase near the asymptote

which  is  the  resonant  region,  consistent  with  the  fact  that  in  this  region  the  fields  are 
more concentrated (with relatively high values) in a small region near the two interfaces 
and  therefore  they  are  more  sensitive  to  material  losses.  We  do  not  discuss  further  the 
transition into the high-attenuation region beyond 880 THz in the plots for the even mode 
of operation, since for the purpose of the present paper, the interest is mainly focused on 
the  region  of  relatively  low-damping  factors  in  which  NTL  modes  are  present  and  the 
circuit analogy may be straightforwardly applied. 
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  NTL  circuit  analogy,  which  has  been  used  here  for  the 
dominant  even  mode  in  these  structures,  can  also  be  extended  to  the  odd  mode  of

operation.  Such  odd  modes  have  been  utilized  by  Shvets  in  [15]  for  the  ENG-air-ENG 
configuration. In this case the field distribution does not resemble that of a TL with two 
oppositely directed (antiparallel) wire currents, but instead it looks like that of two nano-
wires  with  similarly  directed  parallel)  currents  I ,  which  may  again  be  defined  in  the 
same manner of Eq. (7). The two modes of operation and the model to describe them are 
therefore very different, as will be shown in more details in the next section. 
As a final remark in this section, it should be pointed out that a chain of plasmonic nano-
particles  (similar  to  a  single  array  of  nanoparticles  we  show  in  middle  row  of  Fig.  1) 
when  excited  with  an  electric  field  parallel  to  the  chain  may,  under  proper  conditions, 
support  a  confined  guided  mode,  as  has  been  shown  by  several  groups  [26]-[31].  This 
guided mode has properties similar to the odd mode in the structure shown in Fig. 2. In 
the  circuit  analogy,  each  plasmonic  nano-particle  would  correspond  to  a  lumped  nano-
inductor,  and  the  vacuum  gaps  between  and  around  them  correspond  to  the  nano-
capacitors.  Such  a  cascade  of  inductors  and  capacitors  is  capable  of  guiding  and 
transmitting the wave energy. An analytical model for such propagation along chains of 
plasmonic  and  non-plasmonic  particles  has  been  recently  derived,  and  in  the  limit  of 
closely  packed  particles  corresponds  to  the  predictions  of  the  present  analysis.  In 
particular, when the exciting electric field is parallel to the chain axis, the guided mode is 
consistent  with  the  odd  mode,  as  mentioned  above,  whereas  when  the  electric  field  is 
orthogonal to the chain axis for a single chain or for parallel chains shown in Fig. 1 (top 
row), the structure deals with the even mode propagation. These issues are not discussed 
here and some of them will be reported in a future publication. 
 

Nano-Transmission Lines as 2-D “Flatland” Nano-optics 

 
The  geometry  studied  in  the  previous  section  allows  the  design  of  NTLs  capable  of 
guiding  the  energy  in  a  structure  with  sub-wavelength  lateral  cross  section,  which, 
depending on the proper design and desired operation, may be RH or LH. (This may also 
be achieved by the 1-D cylindrical rods, as found in [17]-[18]) However, as we describe 
below, the structure analyzed in the previous section may also suggest further interesting 
and  exciting  possibilities,  particularly  for  a  2-D  optics  in  the  plane  of  propagation  of 
these anomalous modes.  
In the  x
z−  plane of Fig. 2, these guided modes, in fact, are free to propagate with any 
angle with respect to the  x  axis. Varying the geometrical parameters of such a waveguide 
along the  y  direction affects directly its propagation properties and in particular its phase 
velocity  and  its  forward  or  backward  operation,  i.e.,  its  effective  index  of  refraction  in 
z−  plane of propagation any change 
this plane. In other words, for an observer in the  x
or  modulation  of  the  geometry  in  the  y   direction  results  in  a  change  in  the  effective 
refractive index of the planar metamaterial. This is analogous to the concepts suggested 
in  [32],  where  the  terminology  “flatland  optics”  is  used,  but  this  relies  on  a  totally 
different  phenomenon,  for  which  effective  DPS  or  DNG  planar  metamaterials  with  a 
desired effective refractive index may be synthesized at optical frequencies, by suitably 
modifying the geometry of the waveguide along the  y  axis. This may lead to interesting 
possibilities  for  constructing  and  exploiting  materials  with  anomalous  electromagnetic 
properties at infrared and optical frequencies, as we describe in the following. It is worth 
underlining  an  important  property  of  these  planar  metamaterials:    unlike  the  other 
common  ways  of  constructing  left-handed  metamaterials  with  resonant  inclusions,  here 
these effective 2-D planar metamaterials do not  rely on a resonant phenomenon, similar 
to  their  microwave  counterparts    synthesized  with  printed  microstrip  lines  and  lumped 
circuit elements [21]-[22]. This allows the low-loss conditions in their operation, which 

 

-10- 

Accepted for publication in JOSA B Focus Issue on Metamaterials, to appear in

provides  the  better  possibility  for  demonstrating  some  of  the  unconventional  loss-
sensitive features of such 2-D metamaterials in the IR and visible frequency domains. 
In  order  to  better  describe  some  of  the  interesting  features  of  these  2-D  “flatland” 
structures,  a  proper  “metric”  may  be  defined  to  link  the  geometrical  properties  of  the 
waveguide in the  y  direction to its 2-D effective propagation properties in the plane of 
observation ( x
z−  plane). For an even backward guided mode propagating along the  x  
direction, in the previous section we have already derived the expression (Eq. (7)) for the 
effective current  I  (per unit length in z) circulating in opposite directions along the two 
interfaces of such NTL with even mode of operation. By the same token, in analogy with 
the expression of the current and consistent with the definition of voltage in a classic TL, 
we  may  define  the  effective  voltage  V   (per  unit  length)  at  any  section  of  such 
transmission line as the value of the normal electric field in the  xz  plane:

In  a  standard  TL,  the  supported  mode  is  a  TEM  one,  and  therefore  the  effective 
permittivity  and  permeability  of  the  propagation  are  those  of  the  material  between  the 
two  lines  carrying  opposite  currents.  In  the  NTL  case  here,  however,  the  propagating 
even mode is TE, and the mode is distributed in an inhomogeneous region. The effective 
inε  which may 
permittivity remains the same as that of the material inside the line (i.e., 
be  positive  or  negative),  since  for  this  mode  the  only  available  component  of  magnetic 
field is orthogonal to the propagation direction, but the effective permeability is affected 
xE   parallel  to  the  propagation 
by  the  presence  of  the  component  of  the  electric  field 
vector.    As  a  result,  even  though  all  the  materials  involved here  are  non-magnetic  with 
effμ  may attain a negative value, hence the 2-D structure 
permeability 
may behave as a LH structure. From (9) or (10), the dispersion relation for the modes can 
be expressed as:

This confirms again how for a propagating mode (when

effμ <   and  therefore  a 
negative  effective  refractive  index  for  such  a  planar  metamaterial.  This  is  clearly 
consistent with what was derived in the previous section for the even mode of operation. 
This analysis, however, allows a relatively easy design of such metamaterial structures, 
once the effective required parameters are determined.  
Continuing with this analogy, we may also define the equivalent characteristic impedance 
)
of  this  NTL,  as 
,  which  represents  the  ratio  between  the 
equivalent voltage and current at the input port of a matched or infinitely long NTL. It is 
2 / 2
interesting  to  note  that  the  quantity 
,  which  indicates  the  power  flow  into  a 
standard  TL, here  represents  the  density  of  power  flowing  in  the  x

We note that this power density in the NTL  does not however relate directly to the net 
power being carried by this structure and actually being available to a user, since there is 
an  oppositely  directed  power  flow  in  the  cladding  region.  In  a  standard  TL,  the 
characteristic  impedance  provides  information  about  its  matching  properties,  i.e.,  two 
cascaded TL with similar characteristic impedances show a zero reflection coefficient at

their  junction.  Here,  however, 
impedance of the mode and it is not necessarily the same locally point by point along the

exhibit  certain  reflection,  if  not  properly  designed.  Clearly,  a  necessary  condition  for  a 
good  matching  between  two  NTL  is  that  their  modes  are  similarly  distributed  in  the 
cZ  are similar, but also the transverse 
transverse plane, which is achieved when not only 
thickness of each NTL is comparable. This is why in the design of the structures of Fig. 4

For  the  odd  mode  of  operation,  the  analysis  should  be  conducted  differently,  since  the 
two-wire  geometry  does  not  allow  a  similar  effective  analogy  between  voltages  and 
currents along the line. In this case, the parallel currents tend to distribute more widely in 
the  space  surrounding  the  structure,  and  as  a  result  a  valid  definition  of  the  effective 
parameters requires an integration over the space, which may be given following Shvets

effε   and 

Also  this  definition  satisfies  (11)  for  the  odd  modes  and  is  consistent  with  the  right-
handed or left-handed properties of these modes as derived in the previous section. (This 
definition however may not be applied to the even operation.) 
For the waveguides of Fig. 4, the effective parameters in the two cases are summarized in 
Table 1. 
From  this  table,  we  can  see  that  these  structures  have  high  values  for  effective 
permeability,  which  is  not  typically  achievable  when  metamaterials  are  designed  with 
resonant  inclusions.  Here,  however,  these  values  may  be  achieved  without  any  active 
resonance required, and their effective value is high, due to the slow modes they support. 
Note how the characteristic impedances of the two modes are similar, together with the 
thicknesses of the two waveguides, implying that a low reflection is expected when the 
two  lines  are  cascaded  (this  is  also  confirmed  by  the  very  similar  field  distribution 
obtained in Fig. 4).  In Fig. 7, we show the effective parameters for the NTLs considered 
in Fig. 5 and 6 made of silver and glass with material losses considered. We note the low 
values  of  the  imaginary  parts  of 
effμ ,  showing  how  a  negative  real  part  of 
permeability  with  reasonably  low  losses  may  be  achieved  with  this  configuration. 
Furthermore, in Fig. 7b  one can see the abrupt change in the effective permeability when 
the backward mode begins noticing the presence of a higher-order mode, as discussed in 
the previous section. 
It  is  interesting  to  point  out  that  the  magnitude  of  the  effective  permeability  in  such  a 
planar metamaterial is increased when we get close to the resonance of the structure (i.e., 
for 
),  consistent  with  the  example  of  Table  1  and  the  results  in  Fig.  7.  This 
implies that ohmic losses in the materials eventually limit the maximum magnitude that 
the effective permeability (positive or negative) can reach, since getting too close to such 
a  resonance  may  correspond  to  high  damping  factors  and  consequently  high  imaginary 
parts for the effective parameters. 
z−  plane the structure of Fig. 2 may 
Once it is clear that for a “flatland” observer in the  x
behave as a DPS or DNG planar metamaterial, we have several possibilities for showing 
their anomalous wave interaction. The first example may be the one of cascading a DPS 
material, i.e, a RH NTL as designed in the previous section, with a DNG one, i.e., a LH 
NTL,  in  order  to  verify  the  negative  refraction  phenomenon  at  this  interface.  We  have 
briefly reported this possibility in [20], utilizing the NTL whose modal field distributions 
are depicted in Fig. 4 and with geometrical and effective parameters summarized in Table 
1. As already noticed, we expect a good matching between the two NTL, owing to their 
similar characteristic impedances and thickness  d  of the core slab.  
In Fig. 8a, we see the top view of the phase distribution of the electric field on the  x
z−  
plane, around the interface between the two NTLs presented in Fig. 4, the left with the 
RH  operation,  and  the  the  right  with  the  LH  operation.  An  impinging  guided  mode, 
0x = ). 
coming from the left, is carrying power obliquely with respect to the interface (at 
The angle of incidence in this example is selected to be  43° . A mode-matching technique 
has been applied, considering the higher-order TM even modes, the radiation modes and 
the  TE  odd  modes  supported  by  this  geometry,  which,  at  the  oblique  incidence,  may 
couple to the TM even modes under consideration. As clearly seen from this figure, such 
a mode experiences negative refraction and (almost) total transmission into the LH nano-
layer on the right (the reflection coefficient at the interface is around 0.05). In Fig. 8b, a 
snapshot in time of the electric field distribution is also shown, which clearly shows the 
strong  transmission  with  negative  refraction  at  this  interface.  It  is  interesting  to  note  in 
the figure the relatively short guided wavelength of this mode due to the slowness of this 
mode  in  this  structure.  We  reiterate  that  this  phenomenon,  analogous  to  what  has  been

obtained  at  microwave  frequencies  with  planar  2-D  TL  loaded  with  lumped  circuit 
elements [9, 10], has been obtained here, by using plasmonic isotropic ENG metamaterial 
layers,  with  no  need  for  materials  with  negative  permeability,  and  potentially  at 
frequencies  (e.g.,  IR  and  visible  regimes)  where  standard  lumped  circuit  elements  may 
not be easily feasible.  
In  Fig.  9,  a  plot  of  the  transmission  coefficient  at  the  same  interface,  as  a  function  of 
zβ   is  the  transverse  component  of  β  (transverse  with 
/zβ ω εμ   is  shown,  where 
zβ   for  which  a  very  high 
respect  to  the  interface  at 
transmission is possible at this interface is much higher than 
0ω εμ ; however, we must 
remember  that  for  our  design  the  value  of  β  for  the  guided  modes  in  the  two  lines  is 

0x = ).  Here  the  values  of

already much higher than 
. Nevertheless, the plot 
of  transmission  coefficient  shows  the  realistic  possibility  of  sub-wavelength  focusing 
LHβ , and the corresponding wave 
with this setup, since when 
becomes  evanescent  in  the  x   direction, the  “growing  exponential”  phenomenon  [1]-[2] 
may  be  achieved  in  these  NTLs,  as  evident  form  the  growth  of  the  transmission 
coefficient in this evanescent region in Fig. 9. 
The potential applications of this structure may span from sub-wavelength focusing and 
near-field imaging to diffraction-less guided transport of signal. In order to numerically 
verify the possibility of sub-wavelength focusing in this planar set-up, in our theoretical 
study we place a source at a given distance from such an interface, expecting to obtain a 
focusing on the other side of the interface, with a resolution much higher than that in free 
space,  mainly  due  to  the  negative  refraction  of  the  propagating  modes  (which  already 
spam a range of spatial frequencies much higher than that in vacuum, as already noticed 
from Fig. 8), and also due to the growing-exponential phenomenon previously predicted, 
which may allow, in principle a higher-than-conventional resolution, similar to what was 
discussed  in  [2].    In  Fig.  10,  a  localized  current  (i.e.,  a  very  small  source  in  the 
observation plane) has been placed at the location  (
 and the phase 
distribution and a snapshot in time of the instantaneous electric field amplitude has been 
shown  in  the  figure.  An  image  of  the  source  is  reconstructed  on  the  other  side  of  the 
interface, and the focusing properties of such an interface are clearly seen, as predicted. 
Again, the resolution is much higher than the one achievable in free-space optics. 
 in the RH NTL 
In Fig. 11, we compare the source distribution at the point 
  for  different  cases:  (a)  when  the  half-space 
with  the  image  distribution  at 
0x >  is filled with the LH NTL (corresponding to the solid line), as in the case of Fig. 
10;  (b)  when  the  entire  space  is  filled  with  the  RH  NTL  (and  therefore  there  is  no 
focusing); (c) when everything would be in vacuum; (d) when we have just the RH NTL 
with an ideal optical lens to focus the source plane into the image plane; and finally (e) 
when  we  have  the  same  lens  but  in  free  space.  As  you  can  see  the  RH-LH  interface 
restores the source plane into the image plane with a very good resolution, which is much 
higher than that in the free-space. As mentioned earlier, this is mainly due to the negative 
refraction and focusing of the propagating modes.   
These RH and LH NTLs can be extended to more complex geometries such as the one in 
Fig. 12, which is indeed the planar plasmonic version of Pendry’s lens [2], consisting of 
an  LH  NTL  segment  sandwiched  between  two  RH  NTLs.  This  can  provide  a  planar 
imaging system in the “flatland” optics of the x-z plane with a resolution higher than the 
conventional values. Other interesting possibilities to envision include structures such as 
small segments of paired RH-LH NTLs in the 2-D planar structures with high scattering

Conclusions 

 
Motivated by our development of nano-scale circuit elements at the optical frequencies, 
here  we  have  suggested  the  concept  of  optical  nano-transmission  lines  and  we  have 
shown  how  to  synthesize  such  NTLs  by  stacking  planar  slabs  of  plasmonic  and  non-
plasmonic materials, which can, under proper designs, exhibit the properties of forward 
(right-handed) or backward (left-handed) wave propagation.  Negative refraction and left-
handed propagation can be manifested in such structures without any need for materials 
with  negative  permeability.    The  guided  wave  propagation  in  these  NTLs  have  been 
studied  in  detail,  effective  material  parameters  for  the  guided  modes  in  such  structures 
have  been  derived,  and  some  of  the  potential  applications  such  as  sub-wavelength 
focusing and imaging in these planar optics have also been analyzed.

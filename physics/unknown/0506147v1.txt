Abstract 

Mixed traffic flow consisting of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) 

and manually driven vehicles is analyzed using car-following simulations.  Unlike 

simulations that show suppression of jams due to increased string stability, simulations of 

merging from an on-ramp onto a freeway have not thus far demonstrated a substantial 

positive impact of ACC. In this paper cooperative merging is proposed to increase 

throughput and increase distance traveled in a fixed time (reduce travel times).  In such a 

system an ACC vehicle senses not only the preceding vehicle in the same lane but also 

the vehicle immediately in front in the opposite lane.  Prior to reaching the merge region, 

the ACC vehicle adjusts its velocity to ensure that a safe gap for merging is obtained.  If 

on-ramp demand is moderate, partial implementation of cooperative merging where only 

main line ACC vehicles react to an on-ramp vehicle is effective.  Significant 

improvement in throughput (18%) and increases up to 3 km in distance traveled in 500 s 

are found for 50% ACC mixed flow relative to the flow of all manual vehicles.  For large 

demand, full implementation is required to reduce congestion.

Effect of adaptive cruise control systems on mixed traffic flow

1. Introduction  

Adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems are now available on some luxury cars and might 

be used on a significant fraction of all vehicles in the future.  ACC adjusts vehicle speed 

according to the range and rate of change of range to the preceding vehicle to maintain a 

safe distance.  Throttle control and, in some designs, mild braking can be employed 

above a cutoff speed to achieve the desired range and velocity.  Future generations of 

ACC could take complete control of the longitudinal motion. For recent discussions of 

ACC, see Bareket et al. (2003) as well as VanderWerf et al. (2002). 

Several papers (based on simulations) assessing the impact of the increasing proportion 

of ACC vehicles have appeared. In addition to improving driver comfort and safety, 

system-wide benefits for freeway traffic have been suggested. Kukuchi et al. (2003) as 

well as Kerner (2003) found that ACC vehicles tend to promote stability of traffic flow.  

Davis (2004b), like Kerner (2003), showed that ACC can suppress wide moving jams by 

increasing string stability.  Treiber and Helbing (2001) reported that if 20% of vehicles 

were equipped with ACC, nearly all congestion could be eliminated on a German 

autobahn.  Bose and Ioannou (2003) showed that the flow-density curve for mixed traffic 

should fall between the curves for manual and ACC vehicles.  Ioannou and Stefanovic 

(2005) also analyzed mixed traffic, considering the effects of unwanted cut-ins (See, for 

example, Sultan et al., 2002.)  due to larger gaps in front of ACC vehicles.  They 

demonstrated that the smoothness of ACC vehicle response attenuates the perturbation 

due to a cut-in.  Overall, Ioannou and Stefanovic (2005) concluded that there were 

environmental benefits due to reduced exhaust emissions. 

Not all the effects of ACC on traffic were found to be favorable.  In addition to the cut-in 

problem, Kerner (2003) found that ACC vehicles might induce congestion at bottlenecks.  

Only marginal improvements in travel times were found by Bose and Ioannou (2003) and

by Davis (2004b) in on-ramp simulations.  Since congestion often occurs at bottlenecks 

caused by merging vehicles, the ability of ACC to alleviate congestion can therefore be 

questioned.  The purpose of the present work is to show how the introduction of simple 

cooperative merging between ACC vehicles and other vehicles reduces travel delays and 

increases flow.  No attempt is made to describe how the extra capability could be 

implemented in hardware or software.  Only the benefits of such a capability are 

examined. 

This paper is organized as follows.  The dynamics of both ACC and manual vehicles is 

described in Sec. 2.  Merging at on-ramps and simulations for mixed traffic without 

cooperative merging are discussed in Sec. 3.  The formalism for cooperative merging is 

given in Sec. 4.  Simulations with cooperative merging are reported in Sec. 5.  

Conclusions are stated in Sec. 6. 

2. Vehicle dynamics 

2.1. Adaptive cruise control vehicles 

The dynamics of ACC vehicles for the simulation model is described in this section.  For 

the nth vehicle in a lane, the equation of motion is

2.2. Manual vehicles 
 
In addition to the mechanical time constant τ, human drivers do not respond immediately 

and therefore exhibit a delay time td (typically about 0.75 s), which is included in the 

model.  The equation of motion for manual vehicles is given by a generalized Optimal

The constants in Eq. (10) are given by C1 = 0.086/m, C2 = 0.913, hc = 25 m, and V0 = 

16.8 m/s (Sugiyama, 1996).  

The generalized Optimal Velocity Model, which is a refinement of the modified Optimal 

Velocity Model of Davis (2004a), was chosen for these simulations because the 

dynamical equation of motion, Eq. (8), is similar in form to that for ACC vehicles, Eq. 

(1).  Also, it is one of the few models that is consistent with the requirements of the three-

phase model of Kerner (2002).  In particular, there exist equilibrium states of motion that 

occupy a two-dimensional region of the flow-density phase space.  The original Optimal 

Velocity Model of Bando et al. (1995) does not have this property because the 

equilibrium solutions strictly fall on a curve(cid:151)the fundament diagram.  The original 

model also exhibits unphysical oscillations, especially when a delay time due human

reaction time is included, and has a tendency to have collisions.  The modifications of 

Davis (2003) correct these problems. 

The mechanical constraints, given by Eqs. (5) and (6), are also imposed as well as the 

condition Eq. (6) must be satisfied when

3. Merging at on-ramps  

3.1. Rules for merging 

In this section, merging of vehicles from an on-ramp (lane 2) into the freeway (lane 1) is 

described.  The same rules for merging are applied to both manual and ACC vehicles. 

The region for vehicles to merge into lane 1 is of length dmerge.  See Fig. 1. If at time t the 

vehicle labeled n in lane 2 is selected at random to merge and

where nf (nb) is the vehicle in lane 1 directly in front of (behind) n. See Fig. 2. Every 

0.05 s on average all vehicles are considered for possible merging. The factor Sf is taken 

to be 0.7 because this value was found to produce reasonable merging rates that did not 

interrupt mainline flow substantially.

3.2. Initial Conditions 

, 

 

 

 

The lead vehicle on lane 1 starts at x = 0 at time t = 0 and subsequently moves at the 
speed limit, xo(t) = vLimit t.  The other vehicles have the initial condition vn(0) = Vinitial , 

which is the same for all vehicles and is generally close to the speed limit.  The initial 

positions are given by occupying a fraction p1 of the sites X(k) generated according to 

)(
kX

(
kX

−−
)1

kh

   

(21) 

where X(0) = 0 and hk is the kth headway selected at random from a distribution P(h) of 

headways.  If all sites are occupied (p1 = 1) then xn(0) = X(n), n = 1, 2(cid:133)    

For P(h) a power-law distribution is a reasonable approximation for the headways 

observed in freely flowing traffic (Knospe et al., 2002).  It can be generated by repeatedly

where rk is a random number 0 < rk < 1 and h0 is the smallest headway.  It is determined 
by the initial velocity Vinitial according to h0  =  HOV(Vinitial).  The average headway is

 (24) 

 
A typical value of the power is (cid:181) = 3.  No headways smaller than h0 are allowed in the 

initial positions. 

The  initial  positions  of  vehicles  in  lane  2  are  generated  in  a  similar  manner.    Sites  are 
occupied with probability p2 and the leading site is offset by Xoffset to more negative x, i.e., 
X(0) = - Xoffset. 

During the initial time interval 0 < t < td all vehicles in each lane advance according to 
xn(t) = xn(0) + Vinitial t.  From then on, the vehicles move according to the equations of 

motion Eqs. (1) and (8).  Typically simulations involve 600 vehicles and times of 500 s. 

3.3 Simulation Results 

The first simulation is for mixed flow with 50% ACC vehicles randomly dispersed 

among manually driven vehicles on both lanes.  The length of the merge region is dmerge = 

300 m. The mechanical time constant is τ = 0.75 s and the delay time due driver reaction 

is td = 0.75 s.  The headway time for ACC vehicles is taken to be hd = 1.4 s (VandeerWerf 
et al., 2002). The initial conditions are determined by letting h0 = 50 m (corresponding to 
Vinitial =  31.6886 m/s), n = 3, p1 = 1, p2 = 0.3, and Xoffset = 1000 m.  The speed limit is 

vLimit = 32 m/s. 

In Fig. 3, the velocity of vehicles passing x = -dmerge is shown as a function time 

(diamonds).  The lower curve pertains to vehicles on lane 1 and the upper curve to on-

ramp vehicles.  For comparison, the velocities in lane 1 when all vehicles are manual are 

shown (squares).  With 50% ACC vehicles the transition to congested flow occurs later 

but the velocities are lower. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Fig. 4, the velocity of vehicles in lane 1 is shown as a function of position at t = 500 s 

for mixed flow (diamonds) and for the flow when all vehicles are manually driven 

(squares). The spatial extent of the congested region is less in mixed flow than for all 

manual flow.  This somewhat offsets the lower velocities so that the distance traveled in 

500 s (Fig. 5) is larger for mixed flow for the vehicles originally on lane 1 (car number 1 

(cid:150) 400) and about the same for those originating on the on-ramp (car number 401 (cid:150) 600).  

For mixed (manual) flow, cars 1 to 164 (157) have passed the on-ramp and are freely 

flowing.  The lengthening congested region causes the downward slope of this portion of 

curves.  The difference in distance traveled by all vehicles is shown in Fig. 6.  The 

biggest difference is about 1 km. Distance traveled in a certain time is a more natural 

output of these simulations than travel time for a certain distance and serves as a 

surrogate.   

4. Cooperative merging 

Since the mere introduction of ACC vehicles does not appear to reduce congestion 

significantly near an on-ramp, it is suggested that an addition interaction with an on-ramp 

vehicle attempting to merge be added.  In this section, the way a suitably equipped ACC 

vehicle can adjust its position to the preceding vehicle in the opposite lane as they 

approach the merge region is formulated.  The objective of cooperative merging is to 

create a large enough gap so that a merging vehicle can change lanes without slowing 

down appreciably.  Let z0 be a point upstream of the merge region. See Fig. 1. Consider 

an ACC vehicle in lane 1 with label n. Then for z0< xn(t) <-dmerge let

This ensures there is a suitable gap on the main line behind the merging vehicle. If xB(t)> 

xn-1(t) [n-1 is the preceding vehicle in lane 1] then set α = 0, so that the main line vehicle 

does not come too close to the preceding vehicle in the same lane.

 then it is replaced by the speed limit in simulations. 

Occasionally simulations revealed a lock-up phenomenon where an on-ramp vehicle 

becomes stalled at the downstream end of the merge region and a mainline ACC vehicle 

stops just behind it.  In this case, cooperative merging is overridden by setting α = 0 in 

the simulations when the ACC vehicle reaches a small velocity (1-5 m/s) and the lock-up 

is prevented.

5. Simulations with cooperative merging 

The effects of cooperative merging are analyzed in this section.  Initially, we consider 

simulations where only ACC vehicles in lane 1 interact with on-ramp vehicles.  The 

parameters for the ACC vehicles are hd = 1.4 s and hd1 = 1.7 s.  The latter is made larger 

to provide a suitable gap for merging vehicles.  The point at which cooperation begins is 

z0 = -1000 m.  The initial conditions and all other parameters are the same as for Figs. 3-

6.  In Table I, the number of merges in 500 s (M), the number of vehicles to pass x = 25 

(Q3) [This is just beyond the downstream end of the merge region.], and the difference 

=

are given.  If there is no congestion on lane 1, Q = 198.

Surprisingly the number of merges M remains the same for 0 to 100% ACC vehicles.  

The increase in the total number of vehicles passing the end of the merge region is 39 

(18% increase) for 50% ACC compared to all manual vehicles.  Only an insignificant 

further increase is possible with additional ACC vehicles.  The values of Q indicate little 

or no mainline congestion for 50% ACC.  Confirmation of this is shown in Fig. 8.  The 

distance traveled is almost the same for all vehicles for the 50% ACC case.  For the last 

vehicles to emerge from the merge region, the difference between 50% ACC and all 

manual is about 3 km. Even with just 30% ACC (not shown), there is a substantial 

difference (as much as 2 km) in the distance traveled relative to all manual vehicles. The 

cause of the difference is the extensive region of congested flow when there are no ACC 

vehicles as shown in Fig. 9.  Only a small region of decreased speed near the on-ramp 

occurs with 50% of the vehicles equipped with ACC. 

 

 

 

 

 

10

The results shown thus far in this section pertain to ACC vehicles in lane 1 that adjust 

their headway due interaction with on-ramp vehicles.  When on-ramp demand is large it 

is advantageous to include interactions between ACC vehicles in lane 2 (on-ramp) with 

vehicles on lane 1.  The additional interaction is characterized by

Setting p2 = 0.5 (compared to 0.3 previously) gives on-ramp demand high enough that 

50% ACC vehicles can not suppress the formation of congestion.   The velocities of 

vehicles that pass the entrance to the merge region at x = -dmerge are shown in Fig. 10 for 

all manual (diamonds) and 50% ACC vehicles (squares).  Only the ACC vehicles on lane 

1 have interaction with the on-ramp vehicles.  In each case, congestion sets in at about 

100 s and the velocities drop to 5 m/s or less. 

If the additional interaction between on-ramp ACC vehicles and vehicles on lane 1 is 

implemented, the situation improves somewhat as shown in Fig. 11.  In this figure the 

velocity of each vehicle is plotted against its position at t = 500 s.  The full 

implementation of cooperative merging (ACC vehicles in both lanes interacting with 

vehicles in the opposite lane) reduces the region of congestion on lane 1.  However, the 

region of reduced velocity on lane 2 is longer.  Yet the throughput is larger for full 

implementation, 233 compared to 224 vehicles in 500 s.  The number of merges is almost 

the same, 95 and 93 respectively.  The net effect, as measured by the distance traveled by 

all vehicles, is positive as demonstrated in Fig. 12.  For full cooperation, the total distance 
(sum of the individual distances) is dtotal = 8.97 x 106 m; for partial cooperation, dtotal =

8.76 x 106 m; and for all manual vehicles, dtotal = 8.56 x 106 m.  If all vehicles could 
move freely at the speed limit, the distance would be dtotal = 9.60 x 106 m. 

6. Conclusions 

The present work addresses the impact of vehicles with adaptive cruise control on traffic 

flow with a random mixture of ACC and manually driven vehicles.  Previous studies 

generally showed that stability against the formation of jams could be improved by the 

addition of ACC vehicles.  For example, Davis (2004b) showed that 20% ACC could 

prevent a transition to the wide moving jam phase. [If one includes limitations on 

acceleration and deceleration, it takes about 30% ACC to accomplish the same effect.]  

However, the impact of ACC vehicles on congestion near on-ramps is just as important.  

In this case, the published literature is not so sanguine. 

The simulations (without cooperative merging) reported in present work also showed 

only modest improvements in throughput with as many as 50% ACC vehicles.  The 

additional distance traveled by vehicles that passed the on-ramp in the first 500 s was less 

than one km. For vehicles merging from the on-ramp, the distance traveled was a few 

hundred meters less for some vehicles compared to an all-manual scenario, although the 

total distance traveled by all vehicles was greater. 

To make the introduction of ACC vehicles more effective, the implementation of 

cooperative merging was suggested.  No attempt was made to discuss how such an 

improved functionality could actually be implemented; only the potential improvement in 

traffic flow was demonstrated if such a system were feasible.  The first simulations were 

done for partial cooperative merging where only ACC vehicles on the main line interact 

with (sense) on-ramp vehicles (of both types) and adjust their speed.  The flow incoming 

on the main line was 198 in 500 s (equivalent to1426 vehicles/h) on a single-lane 

highway and the on-ramp demand was 64 in 500 s (equivalent to 461 vehicles/h).  With 

50% ACC, congestion was essentially eliminated and travel distances were almost at 

free-flow levels.  The throughput improved by 18% compared to simulations with all 

manually driven vehicles.  With just 30% ACC, the throughput improved by 13%. 

 

 

 

 

12

 

 

 

If the on-ramp demand were significantly larger, partial cooperative merging was found 

to be ineffective and full implementation was required to reduce congestion.  For on-

ramp demand of 106 vehicles in 500 s (equivalent to 763 vehicles/h), the throughput with 

50% ACC was improved approximately 4% when ACC vehicles on both lanes (main line 

and on-ramp) interacted with vehicles in the opposite lane.  The total distance traveled 

during the first 500 s by the 600 vehicles (of which 233 passed the on-ramp) in the 

simulation improved by nearly 5%.  Thus ACC vehicles were able to reduce the amount 

of congestion, but even with full cooperative merging did not eliminate it.  However, the 

total demand of (main line and on-ramp) is nearly equal to the 2200 vehicles/h capacity 

of an all-ACC system with hd = 1.4 s and a speed limit of 32 m/s.  So, it is not surprising 

that only modest improvements were possible.  

The main conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the introduction of cooperative 

merging, if it could be made feasible, would enable ACC vehicles in mixed traffic to 

significantly impact flow.  Although the improvements might not be as striking as the 

effects of increased string stability on jamming, they are nonetheless significant and 

should be considered further.

Negative Refractive Index in Artificial Metamaterials 

Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester, Manchester, M13 

We  discuss  optical  constants  in  artificial  metamaterials  showing  negative 

magnetic  permeability  and  electric  permittivity.  Using  effective  field  theory,  we 

calculate  effective  permeability  of  nanofabricated  media  composed  of  pairs  of 

identical gold nano-pillars with magnetic response in the visible spectrum.

The refractive index of an optical medium, n, can be found from the relation 

2n εµ=

, where ε is medium’s electric permittivity and µ is magnetic permeability [1]. 

There are two branches of the square root producing n of different signs, but only one 

of these branches is actually permitted by causality [2]. It was conventionally assumed 

that this branch coincides with the principal square root  n

εµ=

 [1, 3]. However, in 

1968  Veselago  [4]  suggested  that  there  are  materials  in  which  the  causal  refractive 

index may be given by another branch of the root  n

εµ= −

. These materials, referred 

to as left-handed (LHM) or negative index materials, possess unique electromagnetic 

properties  and  promise  novel  optical  devices,  including  a  perfect  lens  [4-6].  The 

interest in LHM moved from theory to practice and attracted a great deal of attention 

after the first experimental realization of LHM by Smith et al. [7], which was based 

on artificial metallic structures proposed by Pendry et al. [8,9]. Recently, the working 

frequency of negative index materials has been extended to visible [10] and infrared 

light [11]. 

theory.  

The choice of the causal branch of the refractive index becomes  therefore of 

practical  importance  and  has  been  addressed  in  [12],  where  a  rather  complicated 

procedure for the branch choice has been suggested, see also review [6]. The aims of 

this letter is to suggest a unique and simple analytical expression that gives refractive 

index of any optical medium and apply it to calculate optical constants of the recent 

nanomaterials with magnetic response in visible spectrum [10] within effective field 

We  start  with  a  passive  optical  medium.  The  choice  of  the  sign  of  the 

refractive index of a passive medium is based on the fact that a travelling wave should 

decay  in  the  direction  of  its  propagation.  Since  the  propagation  of  a  plane 

electromagnetic wave in linear electrodynamics is described by the exponential factor

)

  [1],  where  ω  is  the  light  angular  frequency,  x  is  the  axis  of

ω
c

propagation,  and  c  is  the  speed  of  light,  causality  requires  that  n''  should  be 

nonnegative  for  any  passive  medium:  n''≥0.  This  condition  uniquely  determines  the 

sign of the square root and hence the sign of the real part of the refractive index n'. It 

is  easy  to  see  that  the  principal  square  root  n

εµ=

  does  not  always  satisfy  this 

condition. To be specific, let us consider an optical medium in which electromagnetic 

response is produced by an array of “molecules”. The electric response of the medium 

is  generated  by  an  “electric”  resonant  mode  of  a  “molecule”  contributing  to  the 

permittivity of a dilute LHM as [1]

  and  eqs.  (1),  (2). 

(We  have  chosen  visible-light  LHM  with  well-separated  “electric”  and  “magnetic” 

resonances:  mλ =0.5µm, 

mλ∆ =0.04µm,  Fm=0.22  and 

eλ =1µm, 

eλ∆ =0.1µm,  Fe=10.) 

One  can  see  that  the  principal  branch  does  not  adequately  describe  the  spectral 

behaviour of the refractive index as it yields the negative sign of the imaginary part n'' 

4 

in  the  spectral  range  of  0.3-0.6µm  (and  hence  wrong  positive  n')  which  contradicts 

causality (see the discussion above).  

We suggest that the causal refractive index of a passive optical medium can be 

found using a simple and unique analytical expression:

where  |z|  and  arg(z)  are  the  modulus  and  the  argument  of  a  complex  number  z,  and 

 is the principal square root taken from the real non-negative number  εµ . Indeed, 

a passive optical material is characterised by a loss of energy, which implies that ε''≥0 

and µ''≥0  [13]  and  therefore  arg(ε)≤π,  arg(µ)≤π.  Expression  (3)  then  always  gives 

arg(n)≤π and hence n''≥0, which is exactly the condition imposed by causality. (It is 

easy  to  check  that  the  causal  refractive  index  (3)  is  indeed  a  square  root  from  the 

product  of  ε  and  µ  as 

).  Figure  1(b)  shows  the  spectral

1(a).  It  is  clear  that  the  causal  refractive  index  correctly  describes  the  spectral 

dependence  of  n  in  the  whole  spectral  range  including  the  region  0.3-0.6µm  with 

negative  n'.  To  a  certain  extent,  the  expression  (3)  is  trivial  and  is  a  direct 

consequence of the fact that n'' should be positive for any passive medium. However, 

to the best of our knowledge, this simple formula is not mentioned in LHM literature, 

see  review  [6],  (often,  as  was  suggested  by  the  Referee,  the  researchers  use  an 

expression 

n

=

(Im(

))

 that corrects the sign of the refraction index).  

 

Situation  is  more  complicated  for  an  active  optical  medium  (or  a  “gain 

medium”). In this case, the expression (3) gives the correct refractive index only for 

some active LHM media. Indeed, let us consider an active LHM medium with a gain 

5 

ε= − −

1 0.1i

  and 

µ= − −

1 0.1i

,  which  corresponds  to  a  negative  refractive  index 

n <   and  an  “amplification”  n''<0.  The  casual  refractive  index  (3)  yields

,  hence  giving  the  correct  negative  index

amplification (n''<0) for such LHM. Unfortunately, the expression (3) is not universal 

as  it  fails  to  reproduce  the  casual  refractive  index  for  some  other  LHM,  say  with 

ε= − −

1 0.1i

 and 

1µ= − . (We note in parenthesis that the “conventional” expression

  obviously  fails  for  any  LHM  medium  with  gain.  For 

example,  for  the  refractive  index  of  LHM  with

  and

  it 

would give

Fortunately,  it  is  possible  to  generalise the  equation  (3).  We  suggest  that  the 

refractive index of any optical medium (passive or active) can be found using another 

simple and unique analytical expression:

(here

  is  the  principal  branch  of  the  square  root).  It  is  easy  to  check  that  the 

expression  (4)  coincides  with  the  casual  refractive  index  (3)  for  any  passive  optical 

medium. At the same time, the expression (4) provides a negative 

'n  and a negative 

absorption 

''n  for any active LHM (for any combination of ε and  µ that would lead 

to a negative refractive index in the absence of an amplification, e.g., for 

ε= − −

1 0.1i

 

and 

1µ= −  the expression (4) gives 

n

). 

It  is  clear  that  the  refractive  index  (3),  (4)  has  to  be  used  in  electromagnetic 

solvers, which routinely employ the principal square root in their modules. (We note 

in parenthesis that the principal square root and the causal square root can be equally 

used  to  find  the  optical  impedance 

Z

=

ε µ

  as  -π≤arg(ε/µ)≤π  for  any  passive 

medium.)  The  choice  of  n  obviously  has  a  dramatic  effect  on  the  effective  optical 

6 

constants  obtained  within  effective  medium  theory,  where  the  interaction  between 

LHM  “molecules”  is  not  weak  and  affects  the  resonant  properties  of  individual 

“molecules”  (e.g.,  changes  the  resonant  wavelengths, λe,m,  half-widths,  ∆λe,m,  etc.). 

We illustrate this by calculating the effective permeability for a dense LHM made of 

the  same  “molecules”  as  for  Fig.  1.  According  to  effective  medium  theory,  the 

effective  field  acting  on  a  “molecule”  in  a  dense  material  is  given  by  the  Lorentz-

Lorenz expression [1] (in the limit s<<a<<λ, where s is the size of the “molecule”, a 

is  the  average  distance  between  “molecules”  and λ  is  light  wavelength).  Also,  the 

effective resonant parameters of the “molecules” (effective 

e mλ  and 

eff
,

e mλ∆

eff
,

) in a dense 

LHM become functions of effective εeff and µeff. In a first approximation we assume 

that the shift of the resonant wavelengths induced by the neighbouring “molecules” is 

proportional to neff: 

eff
δλ =
e m
,

q n
,
e m eff

, where 

,e mq

 are small constants (

q
e m
,

eff
λ<<
e m

). This 

approximation  is  supported  by  Refs.  [14,  15],  where  the  resonant  wavelengths  of 

metallic  “molecules”  are  shown  to  be  proportional  to  the  refractive  index  of  the 

environment.  To  find  the  effective  permeability  we  therefore  solve  the  pair  of  self-

consistent Lorentz-Lorenz (Clausius-Mossotti) equation [1]

respectively, 

(

,e mq =4.5nm). It is clear that Figs. 2(a) and (b) give completely different dependences 

7 

for  µeff  near  the  resonance.  The  effective  permeability  obtained  with  the  principal 

branch of the refractive index is strongly asymmetric and shows abrupt changes at the 

resonance peak position. This can be anticipated as the principal branch gives n of the 

wrong  sign  near  the  magnetic  resonance  for  LHM  of  the  discussed  parameters  (see 

Fig. 1(a)). At the same time, the correct µeff calculated with the causal branch is fairly 

symmetric  and  can  be  satisfactorily  described  by  a  standard  dispersion  relation  (2) 

albeit with different λm and ∆λm.  

Finally,  we  apply  the  causal  effective  medium  theory  to  practice.  We  have 

recently  fabricated  artificial  nanomaterials  formed  by  regular  arrays  of  “nano-

molecules”  produced  by  pairs  of  electromagnetically  coupled  identical  gold  nano-

pillars with plasmon resonances in the visible part of the spectrum [10]. Figure 3(a) 

shows  an  electron  micrograph  of  one  of  our  samples.  The  prepared  structures  were 

regular  arrays  of  Au  pillars  fabricated  by  high-resolution  electron-beam  lithography 

on  a  glass  substrate  and  grouped  in  tightly  spaced  pairs.  Geometry  of  an  individual 

pillar  was  chosen  to  achieve  plasmon  resonances  at  red-light  wavelengths.  The  gap 

between  two  pillars  in  “nano-molecules”  of  Fig.  3(a)  is  about  20nm.  At  such 

separation,  electromagnetic  interaction  between  neighbouring  pillars  within  a  pair  is 

essential  and  plasmon  resonance  observed  for  an  individual  pillar  splits  into  two 

resonances  for  a  pillar  pair.  These  resonances  are  referred  to  as  symmetric  and 

antisymmetric,  similar  to  the  case  of  any  classical  or  quantum  system  with  two 

interacting parts. For the symmetric resonance, electrons in neighbouring pillars move 

in  phase  and  generate  an  overall  dipole  contribution  to  permittivity  ε,  similar  to 

isolated or non-interacting pillars. In the antisymmetric mode, however, the electrons 

move in anti-phase so that the oscillating dipoles cancel each other, leaving only the 

8 

overall magnetic response contributing to µ and quadrupole response contributing to 

non-diagonal, non-local ε. 

Figures  3(b)  and  (c)  show  the  current  distributions  for  the  symmetric  and 

antisymmetric  z-modes,  respectively,  calculated  with  the  electromagnetic  module  of 

Femlab  software  for  the  actual  experimental  geometry.  The  symmetric  z-mode  is 

characterised by non-zero dipole moment directed along the z-axis. The overall dipole 

moment  of  the  antisymmetric  z-mode  is  zero  and  the  circulating  currents  in  the  x-z 

plane  produce  the  magnetic  moment  along  the  y-axis.  There  exist  three  main 

symmetric  and  three  antisymmetric  resonant  modes  in  an  interacting  pair  with 

currents flowing along the x-, y- and z-axes. Excitation of these modes depends on the 

symmetry  of  the  pillar  pair  and  the  conditions  of  light  incidence.  In  our  case,  an 

efficient  coupling  of  the  “magnetic”  resonant  mode  to  incident  light  is  ensured  by 

non-cylindrical geometry of pillars which was intentionally introduced in the design 

through a choice of microfabrication procedures (double-layer resist). 

Figures 3(d) and (e) show typical reflection spectra measured on the sample of 

Fig.  3(a)  under  conditions  of  normal  light  incidence  for  TM  light  (with  the  electric 

field vector along the x-axis) and TE light (with the electric field vector along the y-

axis),  respectively.  The  reflection  spectra  were  collected  by  a  conventional 

spectrometer from an area of 100×100 µm2. There are two distinct resonance peaks in 

the  TM  spectrum  indicated  by  arrows  and  only  one  peak  in  the  TE  spectrum.  The 

symmetry  analysis  and  the  numerical  solution  of  Maxwell  equations  for  the 

experimental geometry with Femlab software [10] (the results are shown in the insets 

of  Fig.  3(d)  and  (e)  for  the  resonant  wavelengths)  proves  that  the  weaker  resonance 

peak  (observed  at  green  wavelengths)  corresponds  to  the  antisymmetric  z-mode  and 

9 

the stronger peaks of Fig. 3(d) and (e) (observed at red wavelengths) correspond to the 

symmetric x- and y-modes of plasmonic resonances, respectively.  

It turned out that the reflection spectra shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e) are described 

extremely well by the Fresnel coefficients of a thin film placed on a glass substrate [1] 

with film’s ε and µ given by eqs. (1), (2); see details in Ref. [10]. (Optical thickness 

of the film, which enters the Fresnel coefficients [1], was calculated using the causal 

refractive  index  n).  Indeed,  the  calculated  Fresnel  reflections  (squares)  of  Fig.  3(d) 

and (e) show an excellent agreement with the experimental data (solid curves). Such 

behaviour is not surprising for a dilute LHM where the interaction between pillar pairs 

is weak and dispersion of an individual “molecule” shapes the spectral dependence of 

ε  and  µ.  However,  it  apparently  contradicts  calculations  performed  with  standard 

electromagnetic solvers for denser LHM that show abrupt changes of µ and ε near the 

resonances [16]. The causal effective mean theory resolves this contradiction. Figure 

4 presents the magnetic permeability and refractive index obtained within the causal 

effective  field  theory  for  the  nanofabricated  material  of  Fig.  3.  In  these  calculations 

we expressed the effective Lorentz-Lorenz field as a sum over the 2D periodic array 

[17] and simultaneously solved self-consistent equations analogous to eq. (5) for ε and 

µ  (with  demagnetization/depolarization  factors  corresponding  to  the  2D  array).  The 

solid  line  of  Fig.  4  shows  the  calculated  permeability  for  the  experimental  array  of 

Fig. 3, the long-dashed line gives µ for the array with a double density of pillar pairs 

and  the  short-dashed  line  presents  µ  for  the  array  with  a  twice-smaller  density  of 

pairs. It is clear that the dispersion of µ in all 3 cases is described well by standard 

dispersion relations (1)-(2), which explains the success of the Fresnel coefficients in 

modelling the reflection spectra from the fabricated 2D arrays. 

10 

In  conclusion,  we  suggested  a  simple  analytic  expression  for  the  refractive 

index  of  any  (active  or  passive)  optical  medium  and  utilised  it  to  calculate  the 

magnetic  permeability  of  the  periodic  2D  arrays  of  double  pillars  within  effective 

field theory. Our results suggest that the visible-light magnetic permeability of dense 

2D  arrays  of  plasmonic  “nanomolecules”  can  be  described  by  standard  (effective) 

dispersion relations.

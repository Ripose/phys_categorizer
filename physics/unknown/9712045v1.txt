Abstract

A complete mathematical framework for coalgebraic formulation of supergeom-
etry and its inﬁnite-dimensional extension is proposed. Within this approach a
supermanifold is deﬁned as a graded coalgebra endowed with a smooth structure.
The category of such coalgebras is constructed and analysed. It is shown that it
contains as its full subcategories both the category of smooth Fr´echet manifolds and
the category of ﬁnite-dimensional Berezin-Leites-Kostant supermanifolds.

1 Introduction

There are basically two diﬀerent approaches to supergeometry: the algebraic approach
introduced by Berezin and Leites [1] and further developed by Kostant [2] and Leites
[3], cf.[4, 5, 6, 7], and the geometrical approach proposed by Rogers [8] and DeWitt [9],
cf.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The theoretical framework incorporating both approaches was ﬁrst
proposed by Rothstein in the form of axiomatic deﬁnition of a supermanifold [15] and
further analysed and improved by Bruzzo at al [16]. The Berezin-Leites-Kostant (BLK)
theory provides the simplest realisation of this axiomatic deﬁnition perfectly suﬃcient
to derive all nontrivial results of ﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry including theories of:
Lie supergroups [2], complex supermanifolds [17, 18, 19], supersymplectic supermanifolds
[20, 21], or moduli of super Riemann surfaces [22, 23, 25, 24].

All these results supported by methods of algebraic and analytic geometry along with
conceptual simplicity of the BLK approach (it does not contain any spurious Grassman
algebra of constants) make it a perfect mathematical language for all physical applica-
tions in which a ﬁnite-dimensional geometry is involved. In supersymmetric classical and
quantum ﬁeld theories however one has to deal with inﬁnite-dimensional superspaces of
supergeometric structures. A typical problem one encounters in this type of applications
is to analyse the global structure of supermoduli intuitively constructed as a quotient of
an inﬁnite-dimensional supermanifold of ﬁeld conﬁgurations by an inﬁnite-dimensional
supergroup of gauge transformations. This construction well known for ”bosonic” models

1

was never made rigorous in the super case. The only method available is based on ﬁnite-
dimensional techniques of deformation theory [22, 25, 24]. Although it usually provides
quite a lot of information about global geometry of the supermoduli, analysing induced
structures seems to require constructing the quotient. The lack of rigorous and eﬃcient
methods of inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry is also responsible for the informal heuris-
tic way one treats anticommuting classical ﬁelds in physical models. As a consequence
the understanding of global geometry of supermanifolds of ﬁeld conﬁgurations as well as
actions of gauge supergroups on these supermanifolds is in sharp contrast with sophis-
ticated methods of standard global functional analysis [26, 27] and detailed knowledge
about similar problems in ”bosonic” models.

The aim of the present paper is to construct an inﬁnite-dimensional extension of the
BLK supergeometry. Before discussing a possible solution to this problem, let us brieﬂy
consider what kind of examples of inﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds one should expect
in physical models. In the standard smooth geometry the most important and interesting
class of objects studied via methods of functional non-linear analysis are manifolds of
In
maps with possibly additional properties like that carried by sections of bundles.
particular manifolds of various geometrical structures belong to this class which is actually
essential for all physical and most of mathematical applications of inﬁnite-dimensional
geometry [26, 27]. One can expect that also in supergeometry, supermanifolds of maps
are fundamental for a geometric formulation of supersymmetric models. For an excellent
heuristic discussion of the notion of map between supermanifolds in the context of physical
applications we refer to the paper by Nelson [28]. A special case of maps from the
supermanifold S1,1 to a manifold was also analysed by Lott [29, 30]. The main point is that
supergeometry requires a notion of map essentially wider than the notion of morphism.
This is in contrast to the standard smooth geometry where both notions coincide.

In the BLK category morphisms are deﬁned as even ZZ2-graded algebra morphisms.
For instance for any pair A, B of supermanifolds all BLK morphisms from A to B form
an ordinary (not graded) inﬁnite-dimensional manifold Mor(A, B). One would rather
expect a supermanifold of maps Map(A, B) with Mor(A, B) playing the role of its un-
derlying manifold. In particular one would like to interpret the ZZ2-graded space of real
valued superfunctions on a ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifold A as a model space of a lin-
ear inﬁnite-dimensional supermanifold of maps from A to IR. Certainly morphisms from
A to IR form only the even part of this superspace.

The fact that morphisms are not enough to capture the intuitive notion of ”odd” maps
one needs in physical application is sometimes referred to as the main shortcoming of the
BLK theory (see for example the discussion in [31]). In its simplest form the argument
says that coeﬃcients of a superfunction are ordinary real-valued functions which do not
anticommute and therefore cannot provide a working model for anticommuting classical
ﬁelds one needs in physics.

This apparent drawback can be simply overcome by regarding anticommuting classical
ﬁelds as odd coordinates on an inﬁnite-dimensional supermanifold of ﬁelds conﬁgurations
[32]. Within the BLK approach the odd variables {θα}n
α=1 can be seen as a basis in the
odd part of a ZZ2-graded model space IRm,n = IRm ⊕ IRn. As such they are genuine
”commuting” objects of standard linear algebra. The ”anticommuting” nature shows up
when elements of the dual basis {θα}n
α=1 are interpreted as generators of the exterior
IRn′ over IRn′. Following this line of thinking one can regard classical fermion
algebra
ﬁelds as elements of the ordinary linear space F1 of sections of an appropriate bundle, with

F1 being the odd part of an inﬁnite-dimensional ZZ2-graded model space F = F0 ⊕ F1.
F ′
Elements of F1 anticommute as arguments of functionals from the exterior algebra

and play essentially the same role as θ-variables in the ﬁnite-dimensional case.

It should be stressed that a reasonable extension of an ordinary manifold Mor(A, B)
to supermanifold Map(A, B) requires a global construction. Indeed according to the basic
idea of the BKL approach one can think of ”odd maps” as odd coordinates of an inﬁnite
dimensional supermanifolds of maps Map(A, B) rather then elements of some set. This
means in particular that also the notion of composition cannot be deﬁned point by point
but rather as a morphism of supermanifolds

V

◦ : Map(A, B) × Map(B, C) −→ Map(A, C)

where × stands for the direct product in the category of inﬁnite-dimensional superman-
ifolds. The obvious requirement for composition ◦ is that its underlying map coincides
with the standard composition of morphisms of ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds.

Another problem of constructing an inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry is to choose
an appropriate class of model spaces. Since the composition of morphisms in the BLK
category involves diﬀerentiation of their coeﬃcient functions with respect to even coordi-
nates, smoothness is the minimal possible requirement for morphisms and functions. In
consequence supermanifolds of supergeometrical structures which are expected to be most
interesting objects of inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry should be modelled on Fr´echet
spaces.

The ﬁrst systematic formulation of inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry was given by
Molotkov [33]. In his approach Banach supermanifolds are deﬁned as functors from the
IRn (n = 1, 2, ...) to the
category of ﬁnite-dimensional real Grassman superalgebras
category of smooth Banach manifolds

The idea to regard supermanifolds as point functors was ﬁrst introduced by Schwarz
in his attempt to reconcile the standard sheaf formulation of BLK ﬁnite-dimensional ge-
ometry with the intuitive informal language used by physicists [34]. The equivalence of
Schwarz’s approach with the BLK theory was shown by Voronov in [35]. Molotkov’s
formulation can be seen as a proper generalisation of the Schwarz description to inﬁnite-
dimensions (i.e. the BLK category of ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds is a full subcate-
gory of the category of smooth Banach supermanifolds).

For any two supermanifolds A, B (not necessarily ﬁnite-dimensional) the supermani-

fold of maps can be deﬁned by the functor

Map(A, B) :

IRn −→ Mor(Pn × A, B)

The formalism also allows for a construction of a composition with the required properties
and applies as well to smooth supermanifolds modelled on locally convex or tame Fr´echet
superspaces. In principle Molotkov’s formulation satisﬁes all requirements a mathemati-
cally rigorous inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry should satisfy. It has been in fact implic-
itly used in several papers when a rigorous treatment of elements of inﬁnite-dimensional

3

supergeometry was unavoidable [22, 25, 29, 30]. However, technical and conceptual dif-
ﬁculties of this approach make its wider application in physics highly problematic. Ac-
cording to the basic idea of the functorial approach an object A in the category is fully
described by morphisms Mor(Pn, A) from a suﬃciently large family {Pn}n∈I of other ob-
jects. Such description is in sharp contrast with the intuitive physical understanding of
space or superspace. Also technicalities involved are in contrast with relatively simple
heuristic formalism used by physicists.

Another approach to inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry aimed to avoid the functo-
rial deﬁnition of supermanifolds was developed by Schmitt [36, 37]. The basic idea is
to deﬁne an inﬁnite-dimensional supermanifold as a ringed space. Although not func-
torial, this approach is technically even more complicated. The main reason is that in
the inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry the language and methods of algebraic geometry
are essentially less eﬃcient and less powerful than in the ﬁnite-dimensional case. In the
standard BLK approach one has a very simple algebraic description of morphisms be-
tween supermanifolds, either as morphisms of sheaves of graded algebras or as morphisms
of graded algebras of functions. Also vector ﬁelds on a supermanifold can be described
in a purely algebraic way as graded derivations of the graded algebra of superfunctions.
Proceeding to inﬁnite-dimensional geometry one can still consider sheaves of smooth func-
tionals but the simple algebraic descriptions of morphisms and vector ﬁelds are no longer
available. Additional conditions involving topology as well as diﬀerential calculus on the
inﬁnite-dimensional model spaces are required in both cases. In fact technical diﬃculties
involved were overcome only in the case of real-analytic and complex-analytic superman-
ifolds [36, 37] which essentially restricts possible physical applications of the theory. It
is also not clear how to construct supermanifolds of maps and composition within this
approach.

The formalisms of both approaches seem to be technically too diﬃcult when com-
pared with relatively simple heuristic rules used by physicists even in most complicated
geometrical supersymmetric models. This suggests that there might be a simpler the-
ory incorporating all desired features of the hitherto formulations but better suited for
constructing and analysing examples arising in physical applications.

The aim of the present paper is to construct an alternative coalgebraic formulation of
inﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry which allows to avoid at least some of the technicalities
of the functorial and the sheaf descriptions. The idea of such approach was ﬁrst proposed
in the excellent paper by Batchelor [38] where a candidate for the dual coalgebra of the
supermanifold of maps between ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds was constructed and
analysed.

For any associative algebra with unit (A, m, u) let us denote by A◦ the largest subspace
of the full algebraic dual A′ such that m′(A◦) ⊂ A◦ ⊗ A◦, where m′ : A′ → (A ⊗ A)′ is
the map dual to the multiplication m : A ⊗ A → A. A◦ with comultiplication given by
m′ and counit given by u′ is called the dual coalgebra of A. In the case of the algebra
C ∞(M) of smooth functions on a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold M, C ∞(M)◦ is called the
dual coalgebra of M and consists of all ﬁnite linear combinations of Dirac delta functions
and their partial derivatives.
In the context of ﬁnite-dimensional supergeometry dual
(ZZ2-graded) coalgebras were ﬁrst analysed and extensively used by Kostant in his theory
of Lie supergroups [2].

The idea of Batchelor’s approach is to consider the dual algebra of a supermanifold as
a fundamental object. The crucial notion introduced in [38] is that of mapping coalgebra

4

P (A, B) deﬁned for any two ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds A, B in terms of universal
coalgebra measuring the algebra of superfuncions on B to the algebra of superfunctions
on A. Although the full structure theorem for P (A, B) has not been proven, the mapping
coalgebra has many expected properties of the dual coalgebra of the supermanifolds of
maps Map(A, B). In particular the space of group-like elements of P (A, B) coincides with
Mor(A, B). Moreover there exists a simple deﬁnition of composition which leads to the
expected Hopf algebra structure in the case of superdiﬀeomorphisms. Batchelor’s con-
struction can be also extended to coalgebras corresponding to supermanifolds of sections.
In the original paper [38] only the algebraic structure of mapping coalgebra has been
analysed. This is certainly not enough to deﬁne supermanifold in terms of its dual coal-
gebra. A pure coalgebra structure has to be supplemented by analytic data encoding a
smooth structure on a supermanifold. This additional data is also necessary to select
those coalgebra morphisms which correspond to smooth morphisms of supermanifolds.
Extra conditions in the deﬁnition of morphisms may seem to be a shortcoming of the
coalgebraic approach in comparison to the algebraic one where smooth morphisms can be
deﬁned in a purely algebraic way. Let us however recall that the simple algebraic deﬁni-
tion does not work in the case of inﬁnite-dimensional model spaces. Moreover the detailed
discussion of morphisms within Schmitt’s sheaf formulation of inﬁnite-dimensional super-
geometry shows that the coalgebraic structure is essential for an appropriate deﬁnition
of smoothness or analyticity [36]. On the other hand (as we shall see in the following)
the extra conditions one has to impose on coalgebraic maps are essentially identical to
the diﬀerentiability condition one imposes on maps of sets in the traditional deﬁnition of
smooth morphisms between manifolds.

In the present paper we propose an intrinsic way to handle the additional analytic data
necessary to describe smooth structures. The main result is the construction of the cate-
gory of smooth coalgebras which contains as its full subcategories both the BLK category
of ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds and the category of smooth Fr´echet manifolds. This
provides a complete theoretical framework of the coalgebraic formulation of supergeome-
try. Although Batchelor’s results [38] were our main motivation, we leave the construction
of smooth structure on the mapping coalgebra P (A, B) for future publications. This in-
volves in particular a construction of smooth atlas on the manifold Mor(A, B), which goes
far beyond the scope of this paper.

It should be stressed that the coalgebraic description of supermanifolds has its ad-
vantages even in the ﬁnite dimensions. First of all the general structure of the theory is
similar to that of the standard smooth geometry: supermanifolds are deﬁned as sets with
extra structure and morphisms as maps of sets (with arrows in the ”right” direction) pre-
serving these structures. Secondly the direct p roduct in the category is just the algebraic
tensor product of coalgebras which makes many of the standard geometric constructions
much simpler and more intuitive than in the sheaf or the functorial approaches. Finally
the coalgebraic techniques proved to be very useful in Kostant’s theory of Lie supergroups
[2]. In fact this theory gets much simpler when smooth coalgebra morphisms are deﬁned
in the intrinsic coalgebraic language without referring to the algebraic formulation.

The content of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains preliminary material nec-
essary for further constructions. In Subsect.2.1 the basic facts about symmetric tensor
algebra S(X) of ZZ2-graded vector space X = X0 ⊕ X1 are presented. In particular Hopf
algebra structure on S(X) is described and a less known universal property of S(X) with

5

respect to its coalgebraic structure is proven. This property is crucial for our description
of smooth coalgebraic maps. In Subsections 2.2 and 2.3 we recall some properties of the
model category fm of Fr´echet manifolds and the model category sm of BLK supermani-
folds, respectively. In Subsection 2.4 the category of BLK ﬁnite-dimensional supermani-
folds is brieﬂy presented. This well known material is included for notational purposes as
well as for providing some motivation for further constructions.

In Section 3 model category sc of smooth coalgebras is deﬁned. In Subsection 3.1. we
introduce open coalgebras as objects of the model category. In Subsection 3.2. we present
a crucial (for all coalgebraic formulation) notion of smooth coalgebra morphism and prove
that it satisﬁes all the required properties. In particular the component description of
morphisms is introduced and the formula for the composition is derived. In Subsection
3.3 the construction of model category sc is completed and the direct product in sc is
analysed. Finally in Subsection 3.4 we prove that the model category fm of Fr´echet
manifolds can be identiﬁed with the full subcategory sc0 of even open coalgebras, and the
model category sm of BLK supermanifolds can be identiﬁed with the full subcategory
sc< of ﬁnite-dimensional open coalgebras. This shows that sc is an appropriate extension
of fm and sm. In Subsection 3.5. the notion of superfunction on an open coalgebra is
introduced and analysed.

In Section 4 we describe construction and main properties of the category SC of

of objects from the model category sc glued together by by a collection of compatible
morphisms from sc. Smooth morphisms of smooth coalgebras are deﬁned along standard
lines by requiring that their local expressions are morphisms from sc. The notion of
superfunction on a smooth coalgebra is deﬁned and the functor from the category of
smooth coalgebras SC to the category of sheaves of ZZ2-graded algebras is constructed.

In Subsection 4.2.
4.3. we prove that the full subcategory SC0 of even smooth coalgebras is isomorphic
with the category of Fr´echet manifolds. In Subsection 4.4. the corresponding result for

supermanifolds is derived.

the direct product in the category SC is analysed.

Appendix contains deﬁnitions and basic facts about ZZ2-graded spaces (A.1), algebras
(A.2), coalgebras (A.3), and bialgebras (A.4). Also some elementary material on dual
coalgebras of ﬁnite-dimensional supermanifolds is brieﬂy presented (A.5).

2 Preliminaries

2.1 Symmetric algebra of graded vector space

Deﬁnition 2.1.1 Let X = X0 ⊕ X1 be a ZZ2-graded space. A symmetric algebra of X is
a pair (S(X), θ) where S(X) is a ZZ2-graded commutative algebra and θ : X → S(X) a
morphism of ZZ2-graded spaces such that the following universal property is satisﬁed.

For every ZZ2-graded commutative algebra A and every morphism F0 : X → A of ZZ2-
graded spaces there exists a unique ZZ2-graded algebra morphism F : S(X) → A making
the diagram

commute.

The uniqueness of S(X) is a standard consequence of the universal property. The existence
can be shown by explicit construction of S(X) as the quotient algebra

Π : T (X) −→ T (X)/I(X) ≡ S(X)

,

where (T (X), θT : X → T (X)) is the tensor algebra of X and I(X) is the ideal generated
by elements

a ⊗ b − (−1)|a||b|b ⊗ a ,

where a, b ∈ X0 ∪ X1, and |.| denotes the parity of an element. The ideal I(X) is
homogeneous with respect to the canonical ZZ2⊕ZZ+ bigrading on T (X) and S(X) acquires
the structure of bigraded commutative algebra

where Sk(X) = Sk
generated by elements of degree 2 , one has the identiﬁcations

0 (X) ⊕ Sk

1 (X) is the k-th symmetric tensor power of X. Since I(X) is

S(X) =

k ≥ 0
L
i = 0, 1

S0(X) = T 0(X) = IR ,
S1(X) = T 1(X) = X ,

and the canonical map θ = Π ◦ θT : X −→ S(X) is injective.

The algebra S(X) is generated by the set {1} ∪ X0 ∪ X1 i.e. every element ω ∈ S(X)

can be represented as a ﬁnite sum of monomials of homogeneous elements of X and 1.

Proposition 2.1.1 Let X, Y be ZZ2-graded spaces and θX : X → S(X) , θY : Y → S(Y )
the canonical inclusions into the corresponding symmetric algebras. Then the universal
extension

κ : S(X ⊕ Y ) −→ S(X) ⊗ S(Y )

of the map

κ0 : X ⊕ Y ∋ (a, b) −→ θXa ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ θY b ∈ S(X) ⊗ S(Y )

is an isomorphism of bigraded algebras.

Remark 2.1.1 By Prop.2.1.1 for each ZZ2-graded space X = X0⊕X1 there is the canonical
isomorphism of bigraded algebras

κ : S(X0 ⊕ X1) −→ S(X0) ⊗

(X1)

,

where S(X0) is the usual symmetric algebra with its canonical ZZ+-grading and the trivial
ZZ2-grading ( S(X0)1 = {o}), and
(Y1) is the usual exterior algebra of the vector space
Y1 with its canonical ZZ2 ⊕ ZZ+ bigrading.

Proposition 2.1.2 Let X be a ZZ2-graded space and S(X) its symmetric algebra.
Let ∆ : S(X) → S(X) ⊗ S(X) be the universal extention of the map

d : X ∋ a −→ a ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ a ∈ S(X) ⊗ S(X)

,

and ε : S(X) → IR the universal extention of the map 0 : X ∋ a −→ 0 ∈ IR.
Then (S(X), ∆, ε) is a commutative cocommutative ZZ2-graded bialgebra.

Remark 2.1.2 We shall introduce some notational conventions which will be used in
various contexts in the following.

A k-partition of the index set {1, ..., n} is deﬁned as a sequence P = {P1, . . . , Pk} of
(possibly empty) disjoint subset of the index set such that {1, . . . , n} = P1 ∪ . . . ∪ Pk. A
k-partition is nonempty if Pi 6= ∅ for all i = 1, ..., k. Note that a nonempty n-partition of
the index set {1, ..., n} is a permutation of {1, ..., n}.

Let X = {ai}n

i=1 be a sequence of nonvanishing homogeneous elements of a graded

space X. For every nonempty subset P of the index set {1, ..., n} we deﬁne

aP = ap1 · . . . · apl ∈ Sl(X)

where {p1, . . . , pl} = P and p1 ≤ . . . ≤ pl. We denote the number of elements of P by
|P |. If P is empty we set aP = 1 and |P | = 0.

For every k-partition P = {P1, . . . , Pk} of the index set {1, . . . , n} we deﬁne the

number σ(X , P) = ±1 uniquely determined by the relation

a1 · . . . · ak = σ(X , P)aP1 · . . . · aPk

.

Proposition 2.1.3 Let (S(X), ∆, ε) be the coalgebra of Prop.2.1.2, and X = {ai}n
a sequence of nonvanishing homogeneous elements of a graded space X. Then:

i=1 be

1. ∆(1) = 1 ⊗ 1, and ε(1) = 1.

gebraic structure of Prop.2.1.2 is a strictly bigraded cocommutative coalgebra.

The coalgebraic structure of S(X) introduced in Prop.2.1.2 is universal in the following
sense

Theorem 2.1.1 Let S(X) be the symmetric algebra of a ZZ2-graded vector space X.
There exists a unique extension of the bigraded commutative algebra structure on S(X)
to a strictly bigraded commutative cocommutative Hopf algebra structure on S(X).

Remark 2.1.4 The antipode s : S(X) → S(X) is given by the universal extension of the
map

− : X ∋ a −→ −a ∈ S(X)op

,

where S(X)op is the bigraded space S(X) with the ”opposite” algebra structure given
by Mop(a ⊗ b) = (−1)|a||b|M(b ⊗ a), uop = u. One can easily show that for arbitrary
homogeneous elements a1, ..., an ∈ X, s(a1 · . . . · an) = (−1)nan · . . . · a1.
Deﬁnition 2.1.2 Let (C, ∆, ε) be a ZZ2-graded coalgebra, (A, M, u) a ZZ2-graded algebra,
and Hom(C, A) the space of linear maps from C to A. For any f, g ∈ Hom(C, A) we deﬁne

f ∗ g ≡ M ◦ (f ⊗ g) ◦ ∆ .

By deﬁnition f ∗ g ∈ Hom(C, A) and |f ∗ g| = |f | + |g| (with respect to the standard ZZ2-
grading in Hom(C, A)). One easily veriﬁes that Hom(C, A) with the multiplication ∗ and
the identity 1∗ ≡ u ◦ ε is a ZZ2-graded algebra. The multiplication ∗ is called convolution.

The next theorem describes the universal property of S(X) with respect to its coalgebra
structure. This result is essential for our description of smooth coalgebra morphisms given
in the subsequent section.

Theorem 2.1.2 Let S(X) be the symmetric algebra of a ZZ2-graded space X and πP :
S(X) → S1(X) = X the projection with respect to the ZZ+-grading in S(X). Let C be
a pointed irreducible ZZ2-graded cocommutative coalgebra and C+ the kernel of the counit
εC in C. Denote by ρ+ : C+ → C the inclusion and by π+ : C → C+ the projection with
respect to the direct sum decomposition C = IR{p} ⊕ C+, where p is the unique group-like
element of C. Then:

1. For every morphism Φ+ : C+ → X of ZZ2-graded spaces there exists a unique mor-

phism Φ : C → S(X) of ZZ2-graded coalgebras such that the diagram

Note that in the purely even case X = X0 ⊕ {0}, S(X) with respect to its ZZ+-graded
coalgebra structure is isomorphic with the universal pointed irreducible cocommutative
coalgebra considered in [40]. Part 1) of the theorem above is a ZZ2-graded version of

formula for the universal extension has been derived in [36]. The proof given here is a
generalization of Schmitt’s method.

2.2 Model Category of Fr´echet manifolds

Let U ⊂ X, V ∈ Y be open subsets of the Fr´echet spaces X and Y , respectively, and
ψ : U → V a map.

Deﬁnition 2.2.1 The derivative of ψ : U → V at a point u ∈ U in the direction x ∈ X
is deﬁned by

D1ψ(u; x) = lim
ǫ→0

ψ(u + ǫx) − ψ(u)
ǫ

.

whenever the corresponding limit exists. One says that ψ is continuously diﬀerentiable or
C 1 on U if the limit exists for all u ∈ U and x ∈ X and if the map

is jointly continuous (as a map on a subset of the product).

D1ψ : U × X −→ Y

Deﬁnition 2.2.2 The higher order derivatives (k ≥ 2) are inductively deﬁned by

Dkψ(u; x1, ..., xk) = lim
ǫ→0

Dk−1ψ(u + ǫxk; x1, ..., xk−1) − Dk−1ψ(u; x1, ..., xk−1)
ǫ

,

whenever the corresponding limit exists.

One says ψ is C k if Dkψ(u; x1, ..., xk) exists for all u ∈ U and x1, ..., xk ∈ X and is

jointly continuous as a map

Dkψ : U × X × ... × X

−→ Y .

A map ψ is smooth (C ∞) if it is C k for all k > 0.

|

}

k

{z

If ψ is C k than Dkψ(u; x1, ..., xk) is totally symmetric and linear separately in x1, ..., xk
[Hamilton]. It can be therefore extended in the second variable to the map

Dkψ : U × Sk(X) ∋ (u; x1 · . . . · xk) −→ Dkψ(u; x1, ..., xk) ∈ Y ,

where Sk(X) is the k-th symmetric tensor power of X. In the following the same symbol
Dkψ will be used for the derivatives and for their extensions deﬁned above.

Using the chain rule and the Leibnitz rule for the ﬁrst derivative [27] as well as an induction
on k one gets

Proposition 2.2.1 Let U, V, W be open subsets of Fr´echet space X, Y, Z, respectively,
and φ : U → V, ψ : V → W , C k maps. Then the composition ψ ◦ φ is a C k map and for
all 1 ≤ l ≤ k, u ∈ U, and x1, . . . , xk ∈ X one has

Dl(ψ ◦ φ)(u; x1, . . . , xl) =

where the sum runs over all ordered nonempty i-partitions of the index set {1, ..., l}.

12

Proposition 2.2.2 For all C k functions f, g : U → IR, 1 ≤ l ≤ k and x1, . . . , xl ∈ X
one has

Dl(f · g)(u; x1, . . . , xk) =

D|P1|f (u; xP1) · D|P2|g(u; xP2)

,

(5)

X{P1,P2}

where the sum runs over all ordered 2-partitions of the index set {1, . . . , l} and the con-
vention D0f (u; x∅) ≡ f (u) is used.

Deﬁnition 2.2.3 The objects of the model category fm of smooth Fr´echet manifolds are
open subsets U ⊂ X where X runs over the category of Fr´echet spaces.

For any two objects U, V ∈ Ofm the space of morphisms Mfm(U, V ) consists of all
smooth maps ψ : U → V . The composition of morphisms is deﬁned as the composition of
maps. An isomorphism in the category fm is called a diﬀeomorphism.

We denote by fm< the subcategory of fm consisting of all open subsets of ﬁnite-dimensional
Fr´echet spaces and all fm-morphism between them.

U = (U, C∞(.)) be the sheaf of smooth functions on U. A smooth map ψ : U → V

Let C∞
induces a morphism of sheaves of commutative algebras

ψ = (ψ, ψ∗

. ) : C∞

U −→ C∞
V

where for each open V ′ ⊂ V the algebra map ψ∗

V ′ is given by

V ′ : C∞(V ′) ∋ f −→ f ◦ ψ ∈ C∞(ψ−1(V ′))
ψ∗

.

A morphism F = (F 0, F.) : C∞
of this form. However for the ﬁnite-dimensional Fr´echet spaces one has
Proposition 2.2.3 Let U ∈ IRm, V ∈ IRm′

be open subsets.

U → C∞

V of sheaves of commutative algebras is not in general

1. For any morphism of sheaves of algebras

F 0 : U → V is smooth and F = F 0.

F = (F 0, F.) : C∞

U −→ C∞
V

,

2. For any algebra morphism A : C∞(V ) → C∞(U) there exists a unique smooth map

ψ : U → V such that ψ∗

U = A.

It follows that for U, V ∈ Ofm< one has the 1-1 correspondence

Mfm(U, V ) = Mfm<(U, V ) ∋ ψ −→ ψ∗

V ∈ Alg(C∞(V ), C∞(U))

.

This simple algebraic description of morphisms either as morphisms of sheaves of alge-
bras or as morphisms of algebras of function is not longer valid for inﬁnite dimensional
Fr´echet spaces. In this case the space of morphisms of sheaves of algebras is essentially
bigger than the space of smooth maps of open sets. In order to characterize the sheaf
morphisms corresponding to smooth maps one needs some additional not algebraical con-
ditions. This makes the idea of ringed spaces in inﬁnite-dimensional geometry rather
awkward and diﬃcult to deal with [36, 37]. This is also the main diﬃculty in devel-
oping a working inﬁnite-dimensional extension of the Berezin-Leites-Kostant theory of
supermanifolds which was originally developed as a theory of ringed spaces [1, 2].

2.3 Model category of BLK supermanifolds

Deﬁnition 2.3.1 The objects of the model category sm of supermanifolds are sheaves of
ZZ 2-graded algebras

Sm,n

(IRn)′)

,

where m, n are arbitrary nonnegative integers and U runs over all open sets of IRm.

For any two objects Sm,n

U , Sm′,n′
)
consists of all morphisms of sheaves of ZZ 2-graded algebras. The composition of morphisms
is deﬁned as the composition of morphisms of sheaves. An isomorphism in sm is called a
superdiﬀeomorphism.

U , Sm′,n′

V

V

V

(IRn)′ in the deﬁnition above denotes the space dual to IRn. An object Sm,n
∈ Osm
is called a superdomain of the superspace IRm ⊕ IRn. For each open subset U ′ of the
(IRn)′ are
underlying set U the elements of the ZZ 2-graded algebra Sm,n(U ′) = C∞(U ′) ⊗
superfunctions on U ′. According to the ZZ 2-grading

U

V

Sm,n(U) = Sm,n(U)0 ⊕ Sm,n(U)1

,

each superfunctions can be uniquely represented as the sum f = f0 + f1 of the even f0
and the odd f1 parts. A superfunction f is called even (odd) if f1 = 0 (f0 = 0).

For each sm-morphism F = (F 0, F.) : Sm,n

the map F 0 : U → V is called
the underlying part of F . In our notation F. denotes the family of ZZ2-graded algebra
morphisms FV ′ : Sm′,n′
(F 0−1(V ′), where V ′ runs over all open subsets of V .
As a ”super” counterpart of Prop.2.2.3 one has [Berezin, Leites, Schmitt]

(V ′) → Sm,n

U → Sm′,n′

V

V

Proposition 2.3.1 Let Sm,n

U , Sm′,n′

V

be superdomains.

1. For any sm-morphism F = (F 0, F.) : Sm,n

U → Sm′,n′

V

the underlying map F 0 : U → V

is smooth.

2. For any morphism A : Sm′,n′

(V ) → Sm,n(U) of ZZ 2-graded algebras there exists a

unique sm-morphism F = (F 0, F.) : Sm,n

U → Sm′,n′

V

such that A = FV .

Remark 2.3.1 It follows from Prop.2.2.3 and Prop.2.3.1 that the covariant functor

Osm ∋ Sm,n

−→ U ∈ Ofm<
Msm ∋ F = (F 0, F.) −→ F 0 ∈ Mfm<

U

has the right inverse

U = Sm,0
Ofm< ∋ U −→ C∞
Mfm< ∋ ψ −→ ψ = (ψ, ψ∗

U ∈ Osm

. ) ∈ Msm .

(6)

The image of the functor above coincides with the subcategory sm0 of sm consisting of all
objects of the form Sm,0
and all sm-morphisms between them. It follows that the model
category of ﬁnite dimensional manifolds fm< can be regarded as the full subcategory sm0
of the model category of BLK supermanifolds.

U

Let {uµ}m

U .

Deﬁnition 2.3.3 Let f ∈ Sm,n(U) and a =
the superfunction f in the direction a is deﬁned by

aIxI ∈ IRm ⊕IRn. The ﬁrst derivative of

D1f (u, θ; a) =

aI∂I f (u, θ)

For a1, ..., ak ∈ IRm⊕IRn the higher order directional derivatives are given by

Dkf (u, θ; a1, ..., ak) =

1 ...aIk
aI1

k ∂I1...∂Ikf (u, θ)

.

The k-th order diﬀerentiations (k ≥ 1) are deﬁned as the underlying parts of the k-th
order directional derivatives:

Dkf (u; a1, ..., ak) =

1 ...aIk
aI1

k (∂I1...∂Ikf )0 (u)

.

f

The higher directional derivatives and diﬀerentiations are totally antisymmetric in the
variables a1, ..., ak and therefore can be uniquely extended (in the second variable) to
linear functions on the k-th graded symmetric tensor power Sk(IRm ⊕ IRn) of the ZZ2-
graded space IRm ⊕IRn. With this interpretation one can use the notation of Rem.2.1.2
for arguments of multilinear functions.

Using the graded Leibnitz rule for ﬁrst derivatives and induction on k one gets the fol-
lowing multiple Leibnitz rule for superfunctions.

Proposition 2.3.2 Let f, g ∈ Sm,n(U) be superfunctions and X = {ai}k
homogeneous elements of the graded space IRm ⊕ IRn. Then

i=1 a sequence of

Dk(f · g)(u,θ; a1, . . . , ak) =

σ(X , P)(−1)|f ||aP2 |D|P1|f (u, θ; aP1) · D|P2|g(u, θ; aP2)

where the sum runs over all 2-partitions of the index set {1, . . . , k}, and the notation of
Rem.2.1.2 as well as the convention D0f (u, θ; x∅) ≡ f (u, θ) are used.

The standard coordinate system on Sm,n
generates the subalgebra of superfunctions with
polynomial coeﬃcients. With the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets
this is a dense subalgebra of Sm,n(U). The following proposition [3, 5, 6, 7] says that the
standard coordinates behave as algebraic generators with respect to ZZ 2-graded algebra
morphisms. This property is essential for the coordinate description of morphisms in sm.

Let us note that the exterior components of the composition depend on the inﬁnitesimal
components G+
k of G and therefore involve partial derivatives in even directions of the
exterior components G∧
k . This property of composition of sm-morphisms is responsible
for most of the peculiar features of supergeometry. In particular this is the reason for
which smooth structures and Fr´echet spaces are indispensable.

2.4 BLK supermanifolds

Deﬁnition 2.4.1 A supermanifold modelled on the superspace IRm⊕IRn is a sheaf AM =
(M, A( . )) of ZZ2-graded algebras on a Hausdorﬀ topological space M such that for each
p ∈ M there exist an open neighbourhood U of p, and an isomorphism of sheaves of
ZZ2-graded algebras

F = (F 0, F.) : AU −→ Sm,n
Φ0(U )

,

where AU = (U, A( . )) is the restriction of AM to U, and Sm,n
Φ0(U) is an open subset of IRm and Sm,n

Φ0(U ) = (Φ0(U), C∞( . ) ⊗

(IRn)′).

Φ0(U ) is a superdomain i.e.

Deﬁnition 2.4.2 The objects of the category SM are supermanifolds modelled on super-
spaces IRm⊕IRn where m, n ≥ 0.

For any two objects AM , BN ∈ OSM the space of morphisms MSM consists of all mor-
phisms of sheaves of ZZ2-graded algebras. The composition of SM-morphisms is deﬁned
as the composition of morphisms of sheaves.

Let AM be a supermanifold. The collection {(Uα, Fα)}α∈I of isomorphisms of sheaves of
ZZ2-graded algebras

Fα = (F 0

α, Fα.) : AUα −→ Sm,n

α(Uα)

,

such that {Uα}α∈I is an open cover of M is called an (m, n)-atlas on AM .

Let {(Uα, Fα)}α∈I be an atlas on a supermanifold AM . Then by Rem.2.3.1 the collec-
tion {F 0
α}α∈I is a smooth atlas on M. By the same token diﬀerent atlases on AM lead to
compatible atlases and M acquires a unique smooth structure. M with this structure is
called the underlying manifold of AM .

One has the following global version of Prop.2.3.1 [3, 5, 6, 7].

Proposition 2.4.1 Let AM , BN be supermanifolds.

1. For any SM-morphism F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN the underlying map F 0 : M → N

is smooth.

2. For any morphism A : B(N) → A(M) of ZZ 2-graded algebras there exists a unique

SM-morphism F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN such that A = FN .

Let F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN be a morphism of supermanifolds and {(Vγ, Gγ)}γ∈J an
atlas on BN . Then there exsists an atlas {(Uα, Fα)}α∈I on AM , such that for all α ∈ I
there exists (a non necessarily unique) α′ ∈ J for which F 0(Uα) ⊂ Vα′. The family of
sm-morphisms {Fαα′}α∈I deﬁned for each α ∈ I by

is called a representation of the morphism F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN in the atlas
{(Vγ, Ψγ)}γ∈J on BN .

Fαα′ = Gα′ ◦ F ◦ F −1

Proposition 2.4.2 Let {(Uα, Fα)}α∈I be an (m, n)-atlas on a supermanifold AM , and
{(Vγ, Gγ)}γ∈J an (m′, n′)-atlas on a supermanifold BN . Let {Fαα′}α∈I be a family of maps
such that:

1. for all α ∈ I, Fαα′ : Sm,n
F 0

α(Uα) → S(m′,n′)

G0

α′ (Vα′ ) is a sm-morphism;

2. for all α, β ∈ I such that Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅ one has

Fαβ′ = Gβ′ ◦ G−1

α′ ◦ Fαα′ ◦ Fα ◦ F −1
β

.

Then there exists a unique smooth morphism F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN of supermanifolds
such that {Fαα′}α∈I is a representation of F in the atlas {(Vγ, Gγ)}γ∈J .

Deﬁnition 2.4.3 Let {Uα, ϕα}α∈I be an admissible atlas on a smooth manifold M of
dimension m. Let {Fαβ}α∈I be a collection of maps such that,

1. for all α ∈ I, β ∈ I(α) ≡ {β ∈ I : Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅}

Fαβ = (F 0, Fαβ .) : Sm,n

ϕα(Uα∩Uβ) −→ Sm,n

ϕβ (Uα∩Uβ)

is an isomorphism of superdomains such that F 0

αβ = ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1

3. for all α, β, γ ∈ I such that Uα ∩ Uβ ∩ Uγ 6= ∅, Fβγ ◦ Fαβ = Fαγ on Sm,n

ϕα(Uα∩Uβ∩Uγ).

A collection {Fαβ}α∈I with the properties stated above is called an (m, n)-cocycle of tran-
sition sm-morphisms over the atlas {Uα, ϕα}α∈I on M.

Two cocycles {F ′
compatible if there exists a third one {Fαβ}α∈I such that

Proposition 2.4.3 Let {Fαβ}α∈I be an (m, n)-cocycle of transition sm-morphisms on
M. Then there exists a unique supermanifold AM with the underlying manifold M and

Compatible (m, n)-cocycles of transition sm-morphisms on M lead by the construction

The supermanifold AM and the (m, n)-atlas {(Uα, Fα)}α∈I of the proposition above are
said to be generated by the (m, n)-cocycle {Fαβ}α∈I.

3.1 Objects

Let X be a vector space. The group-like Hopf algebra G(X) of X is the free vector space

and with the Hopf algebra structure given by

MG(x ⊗ y) = x + y
uG(1) = o

∆G(x) = x ⊗ x
εG(x) = 1
sG(x) = −x

for all x, y ∈ X ( +, o, − stand for the addition, the zero vector, and the inverse in the
vector space X). One can easily verify that G(X) is a pointed bigraded commutative
cocommutative Hopf algebra. The direct sum decomposition into irreducible components
takes the form

x ∈ X IRx ,
L
where IRx is a 1-dimensional subcoalgebra generated by the group-like element x ∈ X ⊂
G(X). For every subset U ⊂ X the free vector space IRU is a bigraded subcoalgebra of
IRX,

G(X) =

IRU with the induced bigraded coalgebra structure is called the group-like coalgebra of U.

IRU =

x ∈ U IRx ⊂ IRX .
L

Deﬁnition 3.1.1 Let X = X0 ⊕ X1 be a graded space. The tensor product

DX = G(X0) ⊗ S(X)

of the group-like Hopf algebra G(X0) of X0 and the symmetric algebra S(X) of X is called
the Hopf algebra of the graded space X.

The Hopf algebra structure on DX is given by

MH ((u ⊗ α) ⊗ (w ⊗ β)) = (u + w) ⊗ α · β ,

uH(1) = o ⊗ 1 ,

∆H(u ⊗ α) =

(u ⊗ α(1)) ⊗ (u ⊗ α(2))

,

εH(u ⊗ α) = εG ⊗ ε(u ⊗ α) = ε(α)
sH(u ⊗ α) = sG ⊗ s(u ⊗ α) = (−u) ⊗ s(α)

,

,

for all u, w ∈ X0; α, β ∈ S(X), where ε is given by Prop.2.1.2, and s by Rem.2.1.4. By
deﬁnition of G(X0) and Th.2.1.1, DX is a pointed bigraded commutative cocommutative

X(α)

21

Hopf algebra. Since G(X0) is generated by group-like elements and S(X) is pointed
irreducible one has the following decomposition into irreducible components

DX =

DX u

,

u ∈ X0
L

where DX u = IRu ⊗ S(X) ∼= S(X) for all u ∈ X0.

The subcoalgebra DX o is a strictly bigraded Hopf subalgebra of DX. It acts on DX by
∼= S(X) one

the left and right multiplication. In particular using the identiﬁcation DX o
gets the right action of S(X) on DX,

R : DX ⊗ S(X) ∋ (u ⊗ α) ⊗ β −→ (u ⊗ α) · β = u ⊗ α · β ∈ DX .

By construction each irreducible component is stable with respect to R and for every
u ∈ X0 the map

Ru : S(X) ∋ α −→ (u ⊗ 1) · α ∈ DX u

is an isomorphism of bigraded coalgebras. For the sake of simplicity we will write u for
the group like element u ⊗ 1 ∈ DX. With this convention X0 ⊂ DX and u ⊗ α = u · α for
all u ⊗ α ∈ DX.

Deﬁnition 3.1.2 Let DX be the Hopf algebra of a graded space X = X0 ⊕ X1, and U a
subset of X0. The subcoalgebra DX(U) ⊂ DX

DX(U) =

u ∈ U DX u
L

,

is called the subcoalgebra over U.

In the case of a graded Fr´echet space i.e. a topological direct sum X = X0 ⊕ X1 of
Fr´echet spaces, the subcoalgebra DX(U) over an open subset U ⊂ X0 will be called an open
subcoalgebra of DX.

By deﬁnition, for any U ⊂ X0 the subcoalgebra DX(U) over U is the tensor product of
bigraded coalgebras DX(U) = G(U) ⊗ S(X). As the direct sum of irreducible components
of DX it is stable uder the S(X) right action.

3.2 Morphisms

Let X, Y be graded spaces and DX(U), DY (V ) subcoalgebras over U ⊂ X0 and V ⊂ Y0,
respectively. Let Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) be a morphism of graded coalgebras. Φ sends
group-like elements into group-like elements and irreducible components into irreducible
ones. It follows that Φ is uniquely determined by the map

U × S(X) ∋ u ⊗ α −→ Φ(u ⊗ α) ∈ V × S(Y )

,

(13)

where the cartesian products U × S(X), V × S(Y ) are identiﬁed with the subsets of
DX(U), DY (V ) by the inclusions

U × S(X) ∋ (u, α) −→ u ⊗ α = u · α ∈ DX(U)
U × S(Y ) ∋ (v, β) −→ v ⊗ β = v · β ∈ DY (V )

,
.

22

Note that the map (13) can be regarded as the family {Φu}u∈U of ZZ2-graded coalgebra
morphisms

Φu : DX u ∋ u · α −→ Φ(u · α) ∈ DX Φ(u)

.

Since each irreducible component of DY (V ) is isomorphic to the bigraded coalgebra S(Y )
the universal property of the symmetric Hopf algebra can be used for a more detailed
description of Φ. In order to study various properties of graded coalgebra morphisms it
is covenient to introduce the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 3.2.1 Let X, Y be ZZ2-graded spaces and DX(U), DY (V ) subcoalgebras over
U ⊂ X0 and V ⊂ Y0, respectively. Denote by π : V × S(Y ) → S(Y ), resp. πY :
S(Y ) → Y the canonical projections on the second factor, resp. on S1(Y ) = Y . Let
Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) be a morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgberas. The maps

Φ0 : U ∋ u −→ Φ(u) ∈ V ,
Φ+ : U × S(X)+ ∋ (u, β) −→ πY ◦ π(Φ(u · β)) ∈ Y ,
(X1)+ ∋ (u, γ) −→ πY ◦ π(Φ(u · γ)) ∈ Y ,
Φ∧ : U ×

are called the underlying, the inﬁnitesimal, and the exterior parts of Φ, respectively.

V

For every k ≥ 1, the restrictions

∋ (u, ξ1, . . . , ξk) −→ πY ◦ π(Φ(u · ξ1 · . . . · ξk)) ∈ Y

are called the k-th inﬁnitesimal and the k-th exterior components of Φ, respectively.

|

}

For all k > 1 the inﬁnitesimal and the exterior components of a ZZ2-graded coalgebra
morphism are totally symmetric and even. By the universal property of the symmetric
tensor product the inﬁnitesimal Φ+
k and the exterior Φ∧
k components uniquely extend to
k(X), respectively, which are linear and even in the second
maps on U × Sk(X) and U ×
variable. For the sake of simplicity the same symbols will be used for the components and
for their extensions above. Note that the inﬁnitesimal Φ+, and the exterior Φ∧ parts of
Φ are uniquely determined by their components, {Φ+

k }k≥1, respectively.

k }k≥1, and {Φ∧

V

The following proposition is a consequence of the universal property of the symmetric
algebra with respect to the coalgebra morphisms (Th.2.1.2). It asserts that a morphism
Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) of ZZ2-graded coalgebras is uniquely determined by its underlying
and inﬁnitesimal parts.

Proposition 3.2.1 Let X, Y be ZZ2-graded spaces and DX(U), DY (V ) subcoalgebras over
U ⊂ X0 and V ⊂ Y0, respectively. Let φ+ : U × S(X)+ → Y be a morphism of ZZ2-graded
spaces in the second variable, and φ : U → V an arbitrary map.

Then there exists a unique morphism Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) of ZZ2-graded coalgebras

such that Φ0 = φ, and Φ+ = φ+.

Φ(u, α) = φ(u) · ∗ exp φ+

It follows that a ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphism Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) is uniquely de-
termined by the underlying map Φ0 and the inﬁnitesimal components {Φ+
k }k≥1. In the
following deﬁnition we introduce the notion of smooth coalgebra morphism by imposing
some additional requirements on the maps Φ0, {Φ+

k }k≥1.

Deﬁnition 3.2.2 Let X, Y be ZZ2-graded Fr´echet spaces and DX(U), DY (V ) open sub-
coalgebras of DX and DY , respectively.

A morphism Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) of ZZ2-graded coalgebras is said to be smooth if the

following conditions are satisﬁed.

1. The underlying part Φ0 : U → V is a continuous map and for all x ∈ X0, u ∈ U,

the directional derivative D1Φ0(u; x) exists.

2. For every k ≥ 1, the k-th inﬁnitesimal component

is jointly continuous with respect to the cartesian product topology on U × X ×k and
the directional derivatives D1Φ+
k (u, a1, . . . , ak; x) with respect to the ﬁrst variable
exist for all x ∈ X0, u ∈ U, ai ∈ X.

3. For every u ∈ U, x ∈ X0, ai ∈ X the following relations hold

D1Φ0(u; x) = Φ+
k (u, a1, . . . , ak; x) = Φ+

(16)

Proposition 3.2.2 Let Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) be a smooth morphism of ZZ2-graded coal-
gebras and {xj}l

j=1 an arbitrary sequence of elements of X0.

1. The underlying part Φ0 : U → V of Φ is a smooth map and for every u ∈ U the l-th

order partial derivatives satisfy the relation

DlΦ0(u; x1, . . . , xl) = Φ+

l (u, x1, . . . , xl)

.

(17)

24

2. For every k ≥ 1 the k-th exterior component Φ∧

k of Φ is a smooth map. For evry
u ∈ U, ξi ∈ X1 the l-th order partial derivatives with respect to the ﬁrst variable are
given by the formula

DlΦ∧(u, ξ1, . . . , ξk; x1, . . . , xl) = Φ+

k+l(u, ξ1, . . . , ξk, x1, . . . , xl)

.

(18)

3. For every k ≥ 1 the k-th inﬁnitesimal component Φ+

k of Φ is a smooth map. For

evry u ∈ U, ai ∈ X the l-th order partial derivatives satisfy the relation

DlΦ+

k (u, a1, . . . , ak; x1, . . . , xl) = Φ+

k+l(u, a1, . . . , ak, x1, . . . , xl)

.

(19)

Proof. 1. By condition 1) of Def.3.2.2 the directional derivative D1Φ0(u; x) exists for all
u ∈ U and x ∈ X0. By condition 3) one gets the relation (17) for l = 1. Since by 2) the
ﬁrst component of Φ+ is jointly continuous on U × X so is D1Φ0 on U × X0, hence Φ0 is
C 1. The C l smoothness and the relation (17) for arbitrary l follow from induction on l.
k is C 1 separately
in the ﬁrst variable and the relation (18) holds for l = 1. But Φ∧
k is linear in the second
variable and by the condition 2) of Def.3.2.2, jointly continuous. It follows [27] that Φ∧
k is
jointly C 1. The induction on l yields the C l-smoothness and the relation (18) for arbitrary
xi ∈ X0 and for all l.

2. Let us ﬁx k ≥ 1. Repeating the reasoning above one gets that Φ∧

3. It is a straightforward consequence of 1. and 2..

✷

Let DX(U), DY (V ) be open subcoalgebras. For k ≥ 1 and X1 6= {o} we introduce the
space C ∧

k (DX(U), DY (V )) of all smooth maps

φk : U × X1 × . . . × X1

−→ Y ,

{z
which are k-linear, totally symmetric, and even in the second variable. Note that in the
deﬁnition above X1 is regarded as a purely odd graded Fr´echet space {o} ⊕ X1. Thus
the maps φk are totally antisymmetric in the usual sense. Let C ∧
0 (DX(U), DY (V )) ≡
C ∞(U, V ) be the space of all smooth maps from the open subset U ⊂ X0 to V ⊂ Y0 and

C ∧(DX(U), DY (V )) ≡

C ∧

k (DX(U), DY (V ))

.

For X1 = {o} we put C ∧(DX(U), DY (V )) ≡ C ∞(U, V ).
As a consequence of Propositions 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 one gets the following characterization
of the space Mor(DX(U), DY (V )) of all smooth morphisms Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) of open
subcoalgebras

Theorem 3.2.1 The map

is bijective.

Mor(DX(U), DY (V )) ∋ Φ −→ (Φ0, Φ∧

2 , . . .) ∈ C ∧(DX(U), DY (V ))

In order to complete the construction of the model category we shall show that the
composition of smooth coalgebra morphisms is smooth. For this purpose we start with the
description of the compositon of ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphisms in terms of components.

3.3 Direct product

The considerations of last two subsections leads to the following deﬁnition of the model
category.

Deﬁnition 3.3.1 The objects of the model category sc of smooth graded coalgebras are
open subcoalgebras DX(U) where X runs over the category of graded Fr´echet spaces and
U over all open subsets of the even part X0 of a graded Fr´echet space X.

27

For any two objects DX(U), DY (V ) ∈ Osc the space of morphisms Msc(DX(U), DY (V ))

consists of all smooth coalgebra morphisms Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ).

The composition of morphisms in sc is deﬁned as a composition of coalgebra maps.
An isomorphism in the category sc is called a diﬀeomorphism of open subcoalgebras.

We shall show that in the model category deﬁned above the direct product exists. We start
with the corresponding result for the category of ZZ2-graded cocommutative coalgebras
[40].

Theorem 3.3.1 Let (C, ∆C, εC), (D, ∆D, εD) be ZZ2-graded cocommutative coalgebras.
Deﬁne the maps

πC : C ⊗ D ∋ c ⊗ d −→ εD(d) · c ∈ C ,
πD : C ⊗ D ∋ c ⊗ d −→ εC(c) · d ∈ D .

Then πC, πD are ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphisms and for every ZZ2-graded cocommutative
coalgebra (E, ∆E, εD) and morphisms of ZZ2-graded coalgebras ΦC : E → C, and ΦD : E →
D, there exists a unique morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras Φ : E → C ⊗ D making the
diagram

commute. The ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphism Φ is given by Φ = (ΦC ⊗ ΦD) ◦ ∆E.

(22)

Deﬁnition 3.3.2 Let DX(U), DY (V ) ∈ Osc. The tensor product DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ) ∈ Osc
is deﬁned as follows:
1) With respect to the coalgebra structure DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ) is the tensor product of graded
cocommutative coalgebras.
2) With respect to the topological structure DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ) is identiﬁed with an open
subcoalgebra of DX⊕Y by the canonical isomorphism

DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ) −→ DX⊕Y (U × V )

where the direct sum topology on X ⊕ Y = (X0 ⊕ Y0) ⊕ (X1 ⊕ Y1) is assumed.

Calculating inﬁnitesimal components and checking the conditions of Def.3.2.2 by explicit
calculation of directional derivatives one gets

Proposition 3.3.1

1. Let Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ), Φ′ : DX′(U ′) → DY ′(V ′) be smooth morphisms of open

subcoalgebras. Then the tensor product of ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphisms

Φ ⊗ Φ′ : DX(U) ⊗ DX′(U ′) ∋ m ⊗ m′ → Φ(m) ⊗ Φ′(m′) ∈ DY (V ) ⊗ DY ′(V ′)

is smooth.

28

2. Let εU , εV be counits of open subcoalgebras DX(U), and DY (V ), respectively. Then

the maps

PU ≡ I ⊗ εV : DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ) −→ DX(U)
PV ≡ εU ⊗ I : DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ) −→ DY (V )

,

are smooth morphisms of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

3. The comultiplication ∆ : DX(U) → DX(U) ⊗DX (U) of an open subcoalgebra DX(U)

is a smooth morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

Remark 3.3.1 The underlying parts and the exterior components of smooth ZZ2-graded
coalgebra morphisms of the proposition above are given by

Theorem 3.3.2 (DX(U) ⊗ DY (V ), PU , PV ) is the direct product in the model category of
smooth ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

Proof. By Prop.3.3.1 PU , PV are sc-morphisms. By Th.3.3.1 for any pair of smooth
morphisms of ZZ2-graded coalgebras ΦU : DZ(W ) → DX(U), and ΦV : DZ(W ) → DY (V ),
the map Φ = ΦU ⊗ ΦV ◦ ∆W is the unique ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphism for which the

3.4 Subcategories sc0 and sc<
In this subsection we shall show that the model category fm of Fr´echet manifolds and
the model category sm of BLK supermanifolds are both full subcategories of the model
category sc of smooth coalgebras. This justiﬁes introduction of sc as an extension of fm
and sm.

We deﬁne the category sc0 of even open coalgebras as the full subcategory of sc consisting
of all objects of the form DX0⊕{o}(U) and all sc-morphisms between them. Similarly, the
category sc< of ﬁnite-dimensional open coalgebras is deﬁned as the full subcategory of
sc consisting of all objects of the form DIRm⊕IRn(U) with arbitrary m, n ≥ 0, and all
sc-morphisms between them. For notational convenience we shall introduce simpliﬁed
symbols D(U) ≡ DX0⊕{o}(U) and Dm,n(U) ≡ DIRm⊕IRn(U) for objects of sc0 and sc<,
respectively. Note that by deﬁnition, for all D(U), D(V ) ∈ Osc0 and Dm,n(U), Dm′,n′(V ) ∈
Osc< one has

Msc0(D(U), D(V )) = Msc(D(U), D(V ))
Msc<(Dm,n(U), Dm′,n′(V )) = Msc(Dm,n(U), Dm′,n′(V ))

,

.

By Th.3.3.2 both sc0 and sc< inherit the direct product from sc.

As a consequence of Th.3.2.1 and Th.3.2.2 one has

Proposition 3.4.1 The correspondence

Osc0 ∋ D(U) −→ U ∈ Ofm ,

(23)

Msc0(D(U), D(V )) ∋ Φ −→ Φ0 ∈ Mfm(U, V )

is an equivalence of categories.

It follows that the model category fm of Fr´echet manifolds can be identiﬁed with the full
subcategory sc0 of the category sc of open coalgebras.

Remark 3.4.1 The inverse to the correspondence (23) is given by

Ofm ∋ U −→ D(U) ∈ Osc0

,

Mfm(U, V ) ∋ φ −→ φ∗ ∈ Msc0(D(U), D(V ))

where φ∗ is a unique smooth morphism of coalgebras such that (φ∗)0 = φ. Using formula
(1) of Prop.2.1.3 for comultiplication in S(X) and formulae (14) of Prop.3.2.1 and (17)
of Prop.3.2.2 one gets for u ∈ U, x1, . . . , xk ∈ X,

φ∗(u · x1 · . . . · xk) =

(24)

where the sum runs over all nonempty i-partitions of the index set {1, . . . , k}.

30

Let us now compare D(U) to the dual coalgebra (see Appendix A.5 ) C∞(U)◦ of the
algebra C∞(U) of smooth real-valued functions on an open subset U of a Fr´echet spaceX.
For this purpose we introduce the pairing

h . , . iU : D(U) × C∞(U) −→ IR

deﬁned, for all u ∈ U, x1, . . . , xk ∈ X, and f ∈ C∞(U) by

hu, f iU ≡ f (u)
hu · x1 · . . . · xk, f iU ≡ Dkf (u; x1, . . . , xk)

,

.

(25)

Proposition 3.4.2 Let U be an open subset of a Fr´echet space X, (D(U), ∆U , εU ) the
even open coalgebra, and C∞(U) the algebra of smooth functions on U.

1. For all f, g ∈ C∞(U), ω ∈ D(U),

hω, f · giU =

hω(1), f iU hω(2), giU ,

X(ω)

hω, 1iU = εU (ω)

,

where ∆U ω =

ω(1) ⊗ ω(2).

(ω)
P

2. Let φ : U → V be a smooth map of open subsets of Fr´echet spaces. Then

for all ω ∈ D(U), f ∈ C∞(V ).

hφ∗ω, f iV = hω, f ◦ φiU ,

The ﬁrst part follows from the mutiple Leibnitz rule (Prop.2.2.2) and the explicit for-
mula for the comultiplication in S(X) (Prop.2.1.3). The second part is a straightforward
consequence of the multiple chain rule (Prop.2.2.1) and formula (24) for φ∗.

Proposition 3.4.3 With the notation of Prop.3.4.2 the map

D(U) ∋ α −→ hα, . i ∈ C∞(U)◦

(26)

is an injective morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

Proof. By Prop.3.4.2 and Prop.2.5.3 for all ω ∈ D(U), hω, . iU ∈ C∞(U)◦. By Deﬁni-
tion 2.5.1 of dual coalgebra and Prop.3.4.2 (26) is a morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.
Using the Hahn-Banach theorem for Fr´echet spaces one can show that the pairing (25) is
✷
nonsingular which implies the injectivity of the map (26).

Remark 3.4.2 The image of the map (26) is a subcoalgebra of C∞(U)◦ consisting of
all ﬁnite linear combinations of evaluations of directional derivatives of arbitrary order.
This subcoalgebra will be called the coalgebra of Dirac distributions on U. For inﬁnite-
dimensional Fr´echet spaces this is a proper subcoalgebra of C∞(U)◦.

We shall proceed to the model category of BLK supermanifolds. Let F = (F 0, F.) :

Th.3.2.1 there exists a unique smooth ZZ2-graded coalgebra map with the underlying part
F 0 and with the exterior components {F ∧

k }n
be another sm-morphism. Then by the above
construction one has a smooth ZZ2-graded coalgebra map G∗ : Dm′,n′(V ) → Dm′′,n′′(W ).
Comparing formula (12) for the exterior components of composition of sm-morphisms
(Rem.2.3.2) with the corresponding one (21) for the composition of smooth ZZ2-graded
coalgebra morphisms (Th.3.2.2) one gets (G ◦ F )∗ = G∗ ◦ F∗.

a pairing deﬁned by

Dkf (u; a1, . . . , ak)

for all u ∈ U, a1, . . . , ak ∈ IRm⊕IRn, and f ∈ Sm,n(U).

As a consequence of the multiple Leibnitz rule (Prop.2.3.3) and the multiple chain
rule (Prop.2.3.5) for superfunctions one has the following sm-counterpart of Prop.3.4.2.

Proposition 3.4.5 Let Sm,n(U) be the ZZ2-graded algebra of superfunctions of a super-
domain Sm,n

U , and (Dm,n(U), ∆U , εU ) the open coalgebra Dm,n(U) = HU (IRm⊕IRn).

1. For all f, g ∈ Sm,n(U)0 ∪ Sm,n(U)1, ω ∈ Dm,n(U),

hω, f · giU =

(−1)|f ||ω(2)|hω(1), f iU hω(2), giU ,

is an isomorphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

Dm,n(U) ∋ ω −→ hω, . i ∈ Sm,n(U)◦

(29)

Proof. Since the pairing (28) is nonsingular the map (29) is injective. By Prop.3.4.5 it
is a morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras. In particular it preserves the coradical ﬁltration

Dm,n(U)u =

Dm,n(U)(k)

S
of the irreducible components Dm,n(U)u, u ∈ U. Hence, for all u ∈ U, k ≥ 0 one has the
injective maps

By Prop.A.5.6 Sm,n(U)◦(k)

u = (Sm,n(U)/I k+1

dim(Dm,n(U)(k)

u ) = dim(Sm,n(U)◦(k)

It follows that the maps (30) are surjective for all k ≥ 0, and u ∈ U, and so is the map
✷
(29).

Remark 3.4.3 By Prop.3.4.6 the open coalgebra Dm,n(U) can be identiﬁed with the dual
coalgebra of the algebra of superfunctions Sm,n(U). The coalgebra of Dirac distributions
on the superdomain Sm,n
is deﬁned as coalgebra of all ﬁnite linear combinations of
evaluations of diﬀerentiations of superfunctions. This coalgebra coincides with the dual
coalgebra Sm,n(U)◦ [2].

3.5 Superfunctions

Prop.3.4.1 and Prop.3.4.3 of the previous subsection provide characterization of even open
coalgebras as objects dual to algebras of smooth functions on open subsets of Fr´echet
spaces. Similarly by Prop.3.4.4 and Prop.3.4.6 ﬁnite-dimensional open coalgebras are
dual coalgebras to alegbras of superfunctions on superdomains. Using this duality smooth
functions in both cases can be regarded as linear functionals on corresponding coalgebras.
This leads to the following deﬁnition of superfunction in general case.

Deﬁnition 3.5.1 Let DX(U) be an open coalgebra. A linear functional f ∈ DX(U)′ is
called a superfunction on DX(U) if the following conditions are satisﬁed.

1. For each k ≥ 0 the function

fk : U × X × ... × X

∋ (u, a1, ..., ak) −→ hf, u · a1 · ... · aki ∈ IR

k

{z

|

}

is jointly continuous with respect to the Cartesian product topology on U × X ×k.

2. For each k ≥ 0 and for all x ∈ X0, u ∈ U, and a1, ..., ak ∈ X the partial derivative

Dxhf, u · a1 · ... · aki = lim
ǫ→0

hf, (u + ǫx) · a1 · ... · aki − hf, u · a1 · ... · aki
ǫ

exists.

3. For each k ≥ 0 and for all x ∈ X0, u ∈ U, and a1, ..., ak ∈ X

Dxhf, u · a1 · ... · aki = hf, u · a1 · ... · ak · xi

.

33

Remark 3.5.1 Let DX(U)′ be the full algebraic dual of an open coalgebra DX(U). Let
us consider the inclusion of ZZ2-graded spaces

i : DX(U)′ ⊗ DX(U)′ −→ (DX(U) ⊗ DX(U))′

,

deﬁned for each f, g ∈ DX(U)′

0 ∪ DX(U)′

1, and α, β ∈ DX(U)0 ∪ DX(U)1 by

hi(f ⊗ g), α ⊗ βi = (−1)|g||α|hf, αihg, βi

.

DX(U)′ has the structure of ZZ2-graded commutative algebra with multiplication

M : DX(U)′ ⊗ DX(U)′

i−→ (DX(U) ⊗ DX(U))′ ∆′

−→ DX(U)′

,

and unit u : IR ε′

−→ DX(U)′.

The explicit formula for the product f · g reads

hf · g, u · a1 · ... · aki =

σ(X , P)(−1)|g||aP1|hf, u · aP1ihg, u · aP2i

,

(31)

XP={P1,P2}

where u ∈ U, a1, ..., ak ∈ X, the sum runs over all 2-partitions of the index set {1, ..., k},
and the notation of Rem.2.1.2 is used. The unit 11 = u(1) is given by

h11, ui = 1 ,

h11, u · a1 · ... · aki = 0 ,

for all u ∈ U, a1, ..., ak ∈ X.

Diﬀerentiating the formulae above with respect to the variable u and checking the condi-
tions of Def.3.5.1 one gets

Proposition 3.5.1 The subspace DX(U)∧ ⊂ DX(U)′ consisting of all superfunctions on
an open coalgebra DX(U) is a ZZ2-graded subalgebra of DX(U)′.

Deﬁnition 3.5.2 Let f be a superfunction on an open coalgebra DX(U). The map

f 0 : U ∋ u −→ hf, ui ∈ IR

is called the underlying part of the superfunction f . For each k ≥ 1 the k-th exterior
component f ∧

k of the superfunction f is deﬁned as a map

f ∧
k : U × X1 × ... × X1

∋ (u, ξ1, ..., ξk) −→ hf, u · ξ1 · ... · ξki ∈ IR .

k

{z

|

}

It follows from Def.3.5.1 that the underlying part and the exterior components of a su-
perfunction f on an open coalgebra DX(U) are smooth functions on U and U × X ×k
1 ,
respectively. For all u ∈ U; x1, ..., xk ∈ X0; ξ1, ..., ξl ∈ X1 one has

hf, u · ξ1 · ... · ξl · xk · ... · x1i = Dx1...Dxkhf, u · ξ1 · ... · ξli

where Dx denotes the partial derivative with respect to u-variable in the direction x ∈ X0.
This implies that the superfunction is uniquely determined by f 0, and {f ∧

k }k≥1.

34

Let DX(U) be an open coalgebra and

R : DX(U) × S(X) ∋ (ω, u · α) −→ u · α · ω ∈ DX(U)

the right action of the Hopf algebra S(X) on DX(U) introduced in Subsect.3.1. For each
ω ∈ S(X) one has a linear map R′

ω : DX(U)′ → DX(U)′ given by

hR′

ωf, u · αi = hf, Rω(u · α)i = hf, u · α · ωi

,

for all u ∈ U, α ∈ S(X). One can easily check that if f ∈ DX(U)′ is a superfunction so
is R′

ωf .

Deﬁnition 3.5.3 Let f be a superfunction on an open coalgebra DX(U). For each ω ∈
S(X) the superfunction Dωf = R′

ωf is called the derivative of f in the direction ω.

The following proposition says that the notions of superfunction on open coalgebra (Def.3.5.1)
and its derivative (Def.3.5.3) are generalizations of the corresponding notions both in the
smooth Fr´echet geometry and in the ﬁnite-dimensional BLK supergeometry.

Proposition 3.5.2

C∞(U) ∋ f −→ f = h . , f iU ∈ DX(U)∧

is an isomorphism of ZZ2-graded algebras. Moreover, for all u ∈ U, x1, ..., xk ∈ X
one has

Dx1...xkf (u) = Dkf(u; x1, ..., xk)

.

2. Let X = IRm ⊕IRn be a ﬁnite-dimensional ZZ2-graded Fr´echet space. Let U be an

open subset of IRm and

h . , . iU : Dm,n(U) × Sm,n(U) −→ IR .

the pairing of Prop.3.4.5. Then the map

Sm,n(U) ∋ f −→ f = h . , f iU ∈ DX(U)∧

is an isomorphism of ZZ2-graded algebras. Moreover, for all u ∈ U, a1, ..., ak ∈
IRm⊕IRn one has

Da1·...·akf(u, θ) = Dkf (u, θ; a1, ..., ak)

.

Remark 3.5.2 Let Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) be a smooth morphism of open coalgebras.
Then the dual map Φ′ : DY (V )′ → DX(U)′ is a morphism of ZZ2-graded algebras. Let f
be a superfunction on DY (V ). For all u ∈ U, a1, ..., ak ∈ X one has

where the sum runs over all nonempty partitions of the index set {1, ..., k}. Following the
proof of Th.3.2.2 one can show that the functional Φ′f is a superfunction on DX(U). It
follows that Φ′ deﬁnes a morphism of ZZ2-graded algebras

Φ∗ : DY (V )∧ ∋ f −→ Φ′f ∈ DX(U)∧ .

The superfunction Φ∗f = Φ′f is called the pull-back of the superfunction f .

Diﬀerentiating formulae (31) and (32) according to Def.3.5.3 one gets the multiple Leibnitz
and the chain rules for superfunctions

Proposition 3.5.3 Let DX(U)∧, DY (V )∧ be algebras of superfunctions on open coalge-
bras DX(U), and DY (V ), respectively, Let Φ : DX(U) → DY (V ) be a smooth morphisms

the restriction map

as dual to the inclusion DX(U ′′) ⊂ DX(U ′). The assignment for each open subset U ′ ⊂ U

a sheaf D∧

Deﬁnition 4.1.1 Let M be a pointed ZZ2-graded cocommutative coalgebra and X = X0 ⊕
X1 a ZZ2-graded Fr´echet space. An X-atlas on M is a collection {(Uα, Φα)}α∈I of charts
(Uα, Φα) satisfying the following conditions;

1. The collection {Uα}α∈I is a covering of the set M of group-like elements of M

2. For each α ∈ I, let M(Uα) be a subcoalgebra of M given by

M =

α ∈ I Uα .
S

M(Uα) =

Mp

,

p ∈ Uα
L

where Mp denotes the irreducible components of M containing p ∈ Uα.

Each Φα is an isomorphisms of ZZ2-graded coalgebras

Φα : M(Uα) −→ DX(Φ0(Uα))

,

where DX(Φ0(Uα)) is an open subcoalgebra of DX.

3. For any α, β ∈ I such that Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅, Φ0

α(Uα ∩ Uβ) is an open subset of X0, and

Φα ◦ Φ−1
β

: DX(Φ0

β(Uα ∩ Uβ)) −→ DX(Φ0

α(Uα ∩ Uβ))

is a diﬀeomorphism of open subcoalgebras of DX.

Let {(Uα, Φα)}α∈I be an X-atlas of M. For each α ∈ I the underlying part of Φα

Φ0

α : Uα −→ X0

is a bijective map onto an open subset of X0, and the compositions

Φ0

α ◦ (Φ0

β)−1 : Φ0

β(Uα) −→ Φ0

α(Uα)

are homeomorphisms. As in the standard theory of manifolds [41] one easily shows that
there exists a unique topology TM on M such that all Uα are open and all Φ0
α are home-
omorphisms onto open subsets of X0.

37

Deﬁnition 4.1.2 Two X-atlases {(Uα, Φα)}α∈I , {(Uβ, Φβ)}β∈J on M are compatible if
the union of them {(Uγ, Φγ)}γ∈I∪J is an X-atlas on M.

One easily veriﬁes that compatible X-atlases on M determine the same topology TM on
M. Since the smoothness of a graded coalgebra morphism in sc is a local property one
also has:

Proposition 4.1.1 The relation of compatibility of X-atlases is an equivalence relation.

Deﬁnition 4.1.3 Let M be a pointed ZZ2-graded cocommutative coalgebra and X a ZZ2-
graded Fr´echet space. An equivalence class of compatible X-atlases on M is called an X-
smooth structure on M. A coalgebra M with an X-smooth structure inducing a Hausdorﬀ
topology TM on M is called a smooth coalgebra modelled on the ZZ2-graded Fr´echet space
X, or simply an X-smooth coalgebra.

Note that by Prop.4.1.1 an X-atlas on M uniquely deﬁnes a smooth structure on M.

Deﬁnition 4.1.4 Let M be an X-smooth coalgebra. An X-atlas on M is said to be
admissible if it deﬁnes an original X-smooth structure on M. A chart (Uα, Φα) on M is
called admissible if it belongs to an admissible atlas on M.

Remark.4.1.1 Let {(Uα, Φα)}α∈I be an admissible X-atlas on a smooth coalgebra M.
By Prop.3.2.2 and Th.3.2.2, {(Uα, Φ0
α)}α∈I is a smooth X0-atlas on M. By the same token
compatible atlases on M induce compatible smooth atlases on M. The space M of group-
like elements of M with the smooth structure determined by the atlas {(Uα, Φ0
α)}α∈I is
called the underlying manifold of M.

Deﬁnition 4.1.5 Let M, N be smooth coalgebras. A morphism Φ : M → N of ZZ2-
graded coalgebras is said to be smooth if for each p ∈ M there exist admissible charts
(Uα, Φα) on M and (Vγ, Ψγ) on N such that p ∈ Uα, Φ0(Uα) ⊂ Vγ, and the map

Ψγ ◦ Φ ◦ Φ−1

α : DX(Uα) −→ DX(Vγ)

is a smooth morphism of open subcoalgebras.

As a simple consequence of Th.3.2.2 one gets

Proposition 4.1.2 The composition of smooth morphisms of smooth coalgebras is smooth.

Deﬁnition 4.1.6 The objects of the category SC of smooth coalgebras are X-smooth
coalgebras, where X runs over the category of graded Fr´echet spaces.

For any two objects M, N ∈ OSC the space of morphisms MSC(M, N ) consists of

all smooth morphisms of graded coalgebras.

The composition of morphisms in SC is deﬁned as a composition of graded coalgebra

morphisms.

An isomorphism in the category SC is called a diﬀeomorphism of smooth coalgebras.

38

Remark 4.1.2. In order to simplify further considerations we assume that objects and
morphisms of the category SC are deﬁned up to diﬀeomorphisms of smooth coalgebras
with underlying parts being identitical maps in FM.

Remark 4.1.3. Let M, N be smooth coalgebras, and Φ : M → N a morphism of
ZZ2-graded coalgebras. The restriction of Φ to the set M of group-like elements of M,
Φ0 : M → N is called the underlying part of the morphism Φ. For composition of two
ZZ2-graded coalgebra morphisms one has (Ψ ◦ Φ)0 = Ψ0 ◦ Φ0. By Rem.4.1.1 if (Uα, Φα),
(Vγ, Ψγ) are admissible charts on M and N , then (Uα, Φ0
γ) are admissible charts
on M and N, and the map

α), (Vγ, Ψ0

Ψ0

γ ◦ Φ0 ◦ Φ0−1

α

: Φ0

α(Uα) −→ Ψ0

γ(Vγ)

is smooth by Prop.3.2.2. It follows that the underlying map of a smooth morphism of
graded coalgebras is a smooth map of Fr´echet manifolds.

Deﬁnition 4.1.7 Let X = X0 ⊕ X1 be a ZZ2-graded Fr´echet space, and {Uα, ϕα}α∈I an
admissible atlas on a smooth manifold M modelled on the Fr´echet space X0. Let {Ψαβ}α∈I
be a collection of maps such that,

1. for all α ∈ I, β ∈ I(α) ≡ {β ∈ I : Uα ∩ Uβ 6= ∅}

Ψαβ : DX(ϕα(Uα ∩ Uβ)) −→ DX(ϕβ(Uα ∩ Uβ))

is an isomorphism of smooth open coalgebras such that Ψ0

αβ = ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1
α ;

2. for all α ∈ I, Ψαα = idIRϕα(Uα)⊗S(X);

3. for all α, β, γ ∈ I such that Uα ∩ Uβ ∩ Uγ 6= ∅,

Ψβγ ◦ Ψαβ = Ψαγ

on DX(ϕα(Uα ∩ Uβ ∩ Uγ)).

A collection {Ψαβ}α∈I with the properties above is called an X-cocycle of transition sc-
morphisms over the atlas {Uα, ϕα}α∈I on M.

One has the following ”reconstruction theorem” which is very useful in constructing new
smooth coalgebras,

Proposition 4.1.3 Let {Ψαβ}α∈I be an X-cocycle of transition sc-morphisms on M.
Then there exists a unique smooth coalgebra M with the underlying manifold M and with
the admissible X-atlas {(Uα, Ψα)}α∈I such that

Ψαβ = Ψβ ◦ Ψ−1

α |DX (Ψ0

α(Uα∩Uβ))

,

(35)

for all α ∈ I, β ∈ I(α).

39

The smooth coalgebra M and the X-atlas {(Uα, Ψα)}α∈I of the proposition above are
said to be generated by the X-cocycle {Ψαβ}α∈I .

Proof. Let {Ψαβ}α∈I be an X-cocycle related to a smooth atlas {Uα, ϕα}α∈I on M.
For p ∈ M, consider the space of pairs (α, m)p, where α ∈ I is such that p ∈ Uα and
m ∈ DXϕα(p) = IR{ϕα(p)} ⊗ S(X). Two such pairs are equivalent

(α, m)p ∼ (α′, m′)p

if m′ = Ψαα′(m). Using the cocycle properties (Def.4.1.7) one easily shows this is an
equivalence relation. Let Mp denote the space of equivalence classes of this relation and
let [(α, m)p]∼ denote the equivalence class of (α, m)p. Since Ψαα′ are ZZ2-graded coalgebra
morphisms Mp acquires the structure of irreducible pointed ZZ2-graded cocomutative
coalgebra:

∆[(α, m)p]∼ ≡

[(α, m(1))p]∼ ⊗ [(α, m(2))p]∼ ,

ε([(α, m)p]∼) ≡ εϕα(Uα)(m)

.

X(m)

Let M be the direct sum of irreducible ZZ2-graded coalgebras

For each α ∈ I we deﬁne

M ≡

p ∈ M Mp
L

.

Ψα : M(Uα) ∋ [(α, m)u]∼ −→ m ∈ IRϕα(Uα) ⊗ S(X)

.

Using the cocycle properties (Def.4.1.7) one veriﬁes that the collection {(Uα, Ψα)}α∈I is
an X-atlas on M with the required transition sc-morphisms. By Prop.4.1.1 it deﬁnes a
unique X-smooth structure on M.

Suppose that there exists another smooth coalgebra M′ over M with an admissible
α)}α∈I satisfying the condition (35). Then the map deﬁned for each p ∈ M

α, Ψ′

X-atlas {(U ′
by

M′

p ∋ m −→ Ψ−1

α ◦ Ψ′

α ∈ Mp

extends by linearity to the diﬀeomorphism of smooth coalgebras over the identity map.
✷
Hence M′ = M by Rem.4.1.2.

Two cocycles {Ψ′
compatible if there exists a third one {Ψαβ}α∈I such that

α′β′}α′∈I, {Ψ′′

α′′β′′}α′′∈I ′′ of transition sc-morphisms on M are said to be

α′}α′∈I ′ ∪ {ϕ′′

{ϕ′
α′β′}α′∈I ′ ∪ {Ψ′′

α′′}α′′∈I ′′ ⊂ {ϕα}α∈I
α′′β′′}α′′∈I ′′ ⊂ {Ψαβ}α∈I

,

,

{Ψ′

as sets of maps. Using the construction of Prop.4.1.3 for all three cocycles of the deﬁnition
above and comparing the resulting smooth coalgebras one gets

Proposition 4.1.4 Compatible X-cocycles of transition sc-morphisms on M generate
the same X-smooth coalgebra M and compatible X-atlases on M.

40

Deﬁnition 4.1.8 Let M be an X-smooth coalgebra. A linear functional f on M is called
a superfunction if for each p ∈ M there exists an admissible chart (Uα, Φα) such that
p ∈ Uα, and the functional (Φ−1
α(Uα)).

α )′f is a superfunction on the open coalgebra DX(Φ0

Proposition 4.1.5 Let M′ be the full algebraic dual of M endowed with the ZZ2-graded
algebra structure dual to the ZZ2-graded coalgebra structure on M.

The subspace M∧ ⊂ M′ consisting of all superfunctions on an X-smooth coalgebra

M is a ZZ2-graded subalgebra of M′.

Let {(Uα, Φα)}α∈I be an admissible X-atlas on a smooth coalgebra M and let U be an
open (with respect to the induced topology TM ) subset of M. Then the collection

is an X-atlas on the subcoalgebra

(U ∩ Uα, Φα|M(U )∩M(Uα))

L

Compatible X-atlases on M induce compatible X-atlases on M(U). The subcoalgebra
M(U) ⊂ M with the smooth structure deﬁned by the induced atlas (36) is called an open
subcoalgebra of M.

Assigning to each open substet U ⊂ M the ZZ2-graded algebra M(U)∧ of super-
functions on M(U) and introducing the restriction maps as duals to the inclusions
M = (M, M( . )∧).
M(U ′) ⊂ M(U), (U ′ ⊂ U) one gets a sheaf of ZZ2-graded algebras M∧
M∧

M is called the sheaf of superfunctions on M.
Let Φ : M → N be a morphism of smooth coalgebras. By Rem.3.5.2 for each
superfunction g ∈ N ∧, the functional Φ′g is a superfunction on M. Φ∗g = Φ′g is called
the pull-back of g. For each open subset V ⊂ N we deﬁne Φ∗
V : N (V )∧ → M(U)∧ as a
map dual to

ΦV : M(Φ0−1(V )) ∋ µ −→ Φ(µ) ∈ N (V )

.

The collection of maps {Φ∗
(Φ0, Φ∗

M → N ∧

. ) : M∧

. } deﬁnes a morphism of sheaves of ZZ2-graded algebras Φ∗ =

N . One has the following global version of Prop.3.5.4

Proposition 4.1.6 The correspondence

M = (M, M( . )∧)
M −→ M∧
Φ −→ Φ∗ = (Φ0, Φ∗
. )

,

,

is a covariant functor from the category SC of smooth coalgebras to the category of sheaves
of ZZ2-graded algebras.

4.2 Direct product

Let M, N be smooth coalgebras modelled on graded Fr´echet spaces X, and Y , respec-
tively. One can introduce an (X ⊕ Y )-smooth structure on M ⊗ N as follows. Let
{(Uα, Φα)}α∈I be an admissible X-atlas on M, and {(Vβ, Ψβ)}β∈J an admissible Y -atlas
on N . Consider the collection

{(Uα × Vβ, Φα ⊗ Ψβ)}(α,β)∈I×J

.

(37)

41

One obviously has

and the ZZ2-graded coalgebra isomorphisms

S

M × N =

(α, β) ∈ I × J Uα × Vβ

,

DX⊕Y (Φ0

α × Ψ0

α × Ψ0

β(Uα × Vβ)) = DX(Φ0
DX⊕Y (Φ0
β((Uα × Vβ) ∩ (Uα′ × Vβ′))) = DX(Φ0

α(Uα)) ⊗ DY (Ψ0
β(Vβ))
α(Uα ∩ Uα′)) ⊗ DY (Ψ0

,

β(Vβ ∩ Vβ′))

.

By Def.3.3.1 the r.h.s of the equations above can be regarded as tensor products in the
model category while the l.h.s as open subcoalgebras of DX⊕Y . Then the ZZ2-graded
coalgebra morphisms

(Φα ⊗ Ψβ) ◦ (Φα′ ⊗ Ψβ′)−1 = (Φα ◦ Φ−1

α′ ) ⊗ (Φβ ◦ Φ−1
β′ )

are smooth by Prop.3.3.1. It follows that the collection (37) deﬁnes an (X ⊕ Y )-atlas
on M ⊗ N . One can easily verify that compatible atlases on M and N lead by the
construction above to compatible atlases on M ⊗ N , hence the following deﬁnition:

Deﬁnition 4.2.1 The tensor product of two smooth coalgebras M, N ∈ OSC modelled
on the ZZ2-graded Fr´echet spaces X, Y , respectively, is the tensor product of ZZ2-graded
cocommutative coalgebras M ⊗ N endowed with the (X ⊕ Y )-smooth structure determined
by the atlas (37).

As a consequence of Prop.3.3.1 one gets

Proposition 4.2.1

1. Let Φ : M → N , Φ′ : M′ → N ′ be morphisms of smooth coalgebras. Then the

tensor product of graded coalgebra morphisms

Φ ⊗ Φ′ : M ⊗ M′ ∋ m ⊗ m′ −→ Φ(m) ⊗ Φ′(m′) ∈ N ⊗ N ′

is a morphism of smooth coalgebras.

2. Let M ⊗ N be the tensor product of smooth coalgebras. Let εM , εN be counits in the

coalgebras M, N , respectively. Then the maps

PM : M ⊗ N ∋ m ⊗ n −→ εN (n) · m ∈ M ,
PN : M ⊗ N ∋ m ⊗ n −→ εM (m) · n ∈ N ,

are morphisms of smooth coalgebras.

3. The comultiplication ∆ : M → M ⊗ M in a smooth coalgebra M is a morphism of

smooth coalgebras.

Remark 4.2.1 Let us observe that the X ⊕ Y -atlas (37) induces the smooth atlas

(Uα × Vβ, Φ0

α × Ψ0
β)

n

(α,β)∈I×J

o

42

on M × N. It follows that the underlying manifold of M ⊗ N is the cartesian product
M × N of Fr´echet manifolds. The underlying parts of smooth coalgebra morphisms from
Prop.4.2.1 are given by

(Φ ⊗ Φ′)0 : M × M ′ ∋ (u, u′) −→ (Φ0(u), Φ′0(u′)) ∈ N × N ′

,

P 0
M : M × N ∋ (u, v) −→ u ∈ M ,
P 0
N : M × N ∋ (u, v) −→ v ∈ N ,
∆0 : M ∋ u −→ (u, u) ∈ M × M .

By Th.3.3.1 and Prop.4.2.1 one gets

Theorem 4.2.1 (M ⊗ N , PM , PN ) is the direct product in the category of smooth coal-
gebras, i.e. for every smooth coalgebra E and smooth coalgebra morphisms ΦM : E → M,
ΦN : E → N there exists a unique morphism of smooth coalgebras Φ : E → M ⊗ N

Remark 4.2.2 The unique morphism Φ in the theorem above is given by the composition

and its underlying part by

Φ = (ΦM ⊗ ΦN ) ◦ ∆E ,

Φ0 : E ∈ u −→ (Φ0

M (u), Φ0

N (u)) ∈ M × N .

4.3 Subcategory of smooth Fr´echet manifolds

Let us denote by OFM and MFM the collections of objects and morphisms of the category
FM of smooth Fr´echet manifolds. In this subsection we shall show that the category FM
is equivalent to the category SC0 of even smooth coalgebras. SC0 is deﬁned as the full
subcategory of SC consisting of all smooth coalgebras modelled on purely even graded
Fr´echet spaces X = X ⊕ {o}. By deﬁnition for all M, N ∈ SC0

MSC0(M, N ) ≡ MSC(M, N )

.

Note that by Th.4.2.1 SC0 inherits the direct product from SC.

Gathering together Remarks 4.1.1, 4.1.3, 4.2.1, and 4.2.2 one gets

43

Proposition 4.3.1 The correspondence

OSC ∋ M −→ M ∈ OFM ,
MSC(M, N ) ∋ Φ −→ Φ0 ∈ MFM(M, N)

is a covariant functor respecting the direct product.

Let {(Uα, ϕα)}α∈I be an admissible atlas on a Fr´echet manifold M modelled on a Fr´echet
space X. By Rem.3.4.1 the family {Φαβ}α∈I of sc-morphisms deﬁned by

Ψαβ = (ϕβ ◦ ϕ−1

α )∗|IRΨ0

α(Uα∩Uβ)⊗S(X)

, β ∈ I(α)

,

(38)

is an (X ⊕ {o})-cocycle of transition sc-morphisms over the atlas {(Uα, ϕα)}α∈I on M. By
the same token cocycles constructed from compatible smooth atlases on M by formula
(38), are compatible. Thus, by Prop.4.1.3 and Prop.4.1.4, the following deﬁnition is not
ambiguous

Deﬁnition 4.3.1 The (X ⊕ {o})-smooth coalgebra D(M) generated by the cocycle (38)
is called the smooth coalgebra of the Fr´echet manifold M.

For each admissible atlas {(Uα, ϕα)}α∈I on M, the (X ⊕ {o})-atlas on D(M) generated
by the cocycle (38) will be denoted by {(Uα, ϕα∗)}α∈I. Applying this construction to the
maximal atlas on M we deﬁne for each admissible chart (U, ϕ) on M the corresponding
admissible chart (U, ϕ∗) on D(M). One easily veriﬁes that the deﬁnition of (U, ϕ∗) is
independent of the choice of admissible atlas containing (U, ϕ).

Proposition 4.3.2 Let M ∈ OSC0. Then M is the smooth coalgebra of its underlying
manifold M, i.e. M = D(M).

Proof. Let {(Uα, Φα)}α∈I be an admissible (X ⊕ {o})-atlas on M. Then by Rem.4.1.1
the atlas {(Uα, Φ0
α)}α∈I is an admissible smooth atlas on the underlying manifold M. For
all α, β ∈ I(α), Φα ◦ Φ−1
β are morphisms of the model category sc0 and by Rem.3.4.1
−1)∗. Then by the construction of D(M) the map deﬁned for each
Φα ◦ Φ−1
p ∈ M by

β = (Φ0

α ◦ Φ0
β

Mp ∋ µ −→ (Φ0

α∗)−1 ◦ Φα(µ) ∈ D(M)p

extends by linearity to a diﬀeomorphism of smooth coalgebras over the identity map.
✷
Hence M = D(M) by Rem.4.1.2.

Let φ : M → N be a smooth map of Fr´echet manifolds. Then for each p ∈ M there are
admissible charts (Uα, ϕα) at p ∈ M and (Vβ, ψβ) at φ(p) ∈ N such that the composition

ψβ ◦ φ ◦ ϕ−1

α : ϕα(Uα) −→ ψβ(Vβ)

is a smooth map between open subsets of Fr´echet spaces (morphism in fm).

For all µ ∈ D(M)p we deﬁne

φ∗p(µ) ≡ ψ−1

β∗ ◦ (ψβ ◦ φ ◦ ϕ−1
By Rem.3.4.1 the deﬁnition above is independent of the choice of admissible charts at
p ∈ M and φ(p) ∈ N. Extending the formula (39) by linearity in p one gets the smooth
morphism of graded coalgebras

α )∗ ◦ ϕα∗(µ)

(39)

.

with underlying part (φ∗)0 = φ.

φ∗ : D(M) −→ D(N)

,

44

Proposition 4.3.3 Let M, N ∈ OSC0. For all smooth morphisms of graded coalgebras
Φ : M → N , Φ = (Φ0)∗.

Proof. By Def.4.1.5 for each p ∈ M there exist admissible charts (Uα, Φα) on M, and
(Vγ, Ψγ) on N , such that p ∈ Uα, Φ0(Uα) ⊂ Vγ and the composition Ψγ ◦ Φ ◦ (Φα)−1 is an
sc0-morphism. Then by Rem.3.4.1

Ψγ ◦ Φ ◦ (Φα)−1 = (Ψ0

γ ◦ Φ0 ◦ (Φ0

α)−1)∗

.

By Prop.4.3.2 one can assume Φα = Φ0

α∗ and Ψγ = Ψ0

γ∗. Hence for all p ∈ M, µ ∈ D(M)p

Φ(µ) = (Ψ0

γ∗)−1 ◦ (Ψ0

γ ◦ Φ0 ◦ (Φ0

α)−1)∗ ◦ Φ0

α∗(µ)

,

and Φ = (Φ0)∗.

✷

Prop.4.3.1, Prop.4.3.2, and Prop.4.3.3 imply the following global counterpart of Prop.3.4.1
and Rem.3.4.1.

Theorem 4.3.1 The correspondence

OFM ∋ M −→ D(M) ∈ OSC0

,

OFM(M, N) ∋ φ −→ φ∗ ∈ MSC0(D(M), D(N))

is an equivalence of categories FM and SC0. Moreover it is the right inverse to the
functor of Prop.4.3.1.

The result above means that the category of smooth Fr´echet manifolds can be regarded
as a full subcategory of the category of smooth coalgebras. This partly justiﬁes our
construction of SC as a ZZ2-graded extension of FM.

Remark.4.3.1 Composing the functors from Prop.4.3.1 and Th.4.3.1 one gets the covari-
ant functor respecting the direct product

OSC ∋ M −→ M −→

Remark 4.3.2 We shall brieﬂy discuss the geometric interpretation of the smooth coal-
gebra of a Fr´echet manifold M. By deﬁnition, D(M) is the direct sum of its irreducible
components

p ∈ M D(M)p
L
With respect to the graded coalgebra structure each irreducible component D(M)p is
isomorphic with S(X ⊕ {o}). For each p ∈ M let

D(M) =

.

D(M)p =

k ≥ 0 D(M)(k)
S

p

be the coardical ﬁltration of D(M)p.

The smooth structure on D(M) is related to the smooth structures of the k-th order

co-jet vector bundles over M in the following way. For k ≥ 0 we deﬁne the subset

and the projection

T (k)(M) ≡

p ∈ M D(M)(k)
S

p x ⊂ D(M)

,

π(k) : T (k)(M) ⊃ D(M)(k)

p ∋ µ −→ p ∈ M .

Let {(Uα, ϕα)}α∈I be an admissible atlas on M and {(Uα, ϕα∗)}α∈I the corresponding
(X ⊕ {o})-atlas on D(M). For each k ≥ 0, the collection

where

(Uα, τ (k)

,

(40)

is a trivializing covering of π(k) : T (k)(M) → M (we are using the terminology of [41]).
One easily veriﬁes that compatible atlases on D(M) yield compatible trivializing coverings
and that π(k) : T (k)(M) → M acquires the structure of a smooth vector bundle over M
with standard ﬁbre S(k)(X).

In the case of a ﬁnite-dimensional Fr´echet space X ≈ IRn the bundle π(k) : T (k)(M) →
M constructed above is called the k-th order co-jet bundle over M and is dual to the
bundle of k-th order jets on M.

In the case of an inﬁnite-dimensional Fr´echet space X, for k ≥ 2 the standard ﬁbre
S(k)(X) is not complete with respect to the direct sum and the projective tensor product
topologies on

S(k)(X) =

Si(X)

,

k

i = 0
L
and Si(X), respectively. Since the transition maps of the trivializing covering (40) are
continuous with respect to this topology, the bundle π(k) : T (k)(M) → M admits a unique
extension to a bundle with a complete standard ﬁbre. Let us stress that in the present
coalgebraic approach this completion will not be used.

Remark 4.3.3 The construction discussed in the previous remark applies also to the
subset of all primitive elements of the coalgebra D(M). Let Tp(M) be the space of all
primitive, with respect to p ∈ M, elements of D(M). For each p ∈ M one has the
invariant decomposition

D(M)(1)

p = IR ⊕ Tp(M)

.

with the projection π : T (M) → M given by π(Tp(M)) = p. In this case the smooth
structure on D(M) induces the canonical smooth structure of the tangent bundle of M.

T (M) ≡

,

Let M be a smooth Fr´echet manifold, (D(M), ∆M , εM ) the smooth coalgebra of M, and
(C ∞(M), M, u) the algebra of smooth functions on M. For each p ∈ M let us consider
the pairing

given by

h . , . ip : D(M)p × C ∞(M) −→ IR ,

hµp, f ip ≡ hϕα∗(µp), f ◦ ϕ−1

α iϕα(Uα)

,

where (Uα, ϕα) is an admissible chart on M at p. One easily veriﬁes that the deﬁnition
above is independent of the choice of an admissible chart at p. Extending formula (41)
by linearity in the ﬁrst variable one gets the pairing

(41)

(42)

h . , . iM : D(M) × C ∞(M) −→ IR .

Using Rem.3.4.1 and Prop.3.4.2 one gets

Proposition 4.3.4 Let D(M) be the smooth coalgebra of a Fr´echet manifold M and
C ∞(M) the algebra of smooth functions on M.

1. For all f, g ∈ C ∞(M), µ ∈ D(M)

hµ, f · giM =

hµ(1), f iM hµ(2), giM ,

X(µ)

hµ, 1iM = εM (µ)

where ∆M µ =

µ(1) ⊗ µ(2).

2. Let φ : M → N be a smooth map of Fr´echet manifolds. Then

hφ∗µ, f iN = hµ, f ◦ φiM ,

for all µ ∈ D(M), f ∈ C ∞(N).

As in the case of open even coalgebras one can show that the pairing (42) is nonsingular.
Then the proposition above implies the following

Theorem 4.3.2 The map

D(M) ∋ µ −→ hµ, . i ∈ C ∞(M)◦

is an injective morphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

4.4 Subcategory of supermanifolds

We deﬁne the category SC< as a subcategory of SC consisting of all smooth coalgebras
modelled on ﬁnite-dimensional ZZ2-graded Fr´echet spaces and all SC-morphisms between
them. By deﬁnition SC< is a full subcategory of SC i.e. for all M, N ∈ OSC<

MSC<(M, N ) = MSC(M, N )

.

By Th.4.2.1 SC< inherits the direct product from SC. In this subsection we shall con-
struct an equivalence of the category of BLK supermanifolds SM introduced in Subsect.2.4
with the category of ﬁnite-dimensional smooth coalgebras SC<.

Let AM be a supermanifold. For each (m, n)-atlas {(Uα, Fα)}α∈I on AM the family of
maps {Fαβ}α∈I given for all α ∈ I, β ∈ I(α) by

Fαβ = Fβ ◦ F −1
α

: Sn,m
F 0

α(Uα∩Uβ) −→ Sn,m

F 0

β (Uα∩Uβ)

.

(43)

is an (m, n)-cocycle of sm-transition maps over the smooth atlas {(Uα, F 0
α)}α∈I on the
underlying manifold M. Applying the functor of Prop.3.4.4 to the cocycle (43) one gets
(IRm⊕IRn)-cocycle of sc-transition maps

Fαβ∗ = (Fβ ◦ F −1

α )∗ : Dm,n(F 0

α(Uα ∩ Uβ)) −→ Dm,n(F 0

β (Uα ∩ Uβ))

,

(44)

over the same smooth atlas on M. By Prop.4.1.3 the cocycle (44) generates a unique
smooth coalgebra D(AM ) and the admissible (IRm⊕IRn)-atlas {(Uα, Fα∗)}α∈I on D(AM ).
One easily veriﬁes that diﬀerent (m, n)-atlases on AM lead by the above construction
to compatible (IRm ⊕IRn)-atlases on the same smooth coalgebra D(AM ). Applying the
construction to the maximal (m, n)-atlas on AM , we deﬁne for each chart (U, F ) on AM
the corresponding admissible chart (U, F∗) on D(AM ).

Deﬁnition 4.4.1 The smooth coalgebra D(AM ) generated by the cocycle (44) is called
the smooth coalgebra of the supermanifold AM .

Reversing the construction above and using the reconstruction theorem for supermanifolds
(Prop.2.3.3) one can show that the correspondence

OSM ∋ AM −→ D(AM ) ∈ OSC<

is bijective. Moreover for each admissible chart (U, Φ) on D(AM ) there exists a chart
(U, F ) on AM such that Φ = F∗.

Let F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN be a morphism of supermanifolds. Then for each p ∈ M
there are charts (Uα, Fα) on AM and (Vγ, Gγ) on BN such that p ∈ Uα, F 0(Uα) ⊂ Vγ, and
the composition

Gγ ◦ F ◦ F −1

α : Sm,n(F 0

α(Uα)) −→ Sm,n(G0

γ(Vγ))

is a morphism in the model category sm.

p ∈ M. For all µ ∈ D(AM )p we deﬁne

Let D(AM )p be the irreducible component of D(AM ) containing the group-like element

F∗p(µ) ≡ G−1

γ∗ ◦ (Gγ ◦ F ◦ F −1

α )∗ ◦ Fα∗(µ)

.

(45)

48

By Prop.3.4.4 the deﬁnition above is independent of the choice of admissible charts at
p ∈ M and Φ0(p) ∈ N. Extending formula (45) by linearity in p one gets the smooth
morphism of graded coalgebras

F∗ : D(AM ) −→ D(BN )

,

with the underlying part (F∗)0 = F 0. As a consequence of Prop.3.4.4 one gets

Theorem 4.4.1 The correspondence

OSM ∋ AM −→ D(AM ) ∈ OSC< ,
OSM(AM , BN ) ∋ F −→ F∗ ∈ MSC<(D(AM ), D(BN ))

(46)

is an equivalence of categories SM and SC<.

It follows that the category of BLK supermanifolds can be identiﬁed with the full sub-
category of the category of ﬁnite-dimensional smooth coalgebras. Since by Th.4.3.1 the
category of Fr´echet manifolds can be identiﬁed with subcategory of even smooth coalge-
bras, SC provides a correct extension of both categories.

Remark 4.4.1 As in the case of category FM of Fr´echet manifolds (Rem.4.3.2, Rem.4.3.3)
the smooth coalgebra of a supermanifold admits the geometrical interpretation in terms
of co-jet vector superbundles [38]. Since the constructions of these bundles requires some
techniques of algebraic geometry [39] not used in the present paper, we refer to the original
paper [38] for the discussion of this point.

Let (D(AM ), ∆M , εM ) be the smooth coalgebra of a supermanifold AM , and (A(M), M, u)
the algebra of superfunctions on AM . For each p ∈ M the pairing

h . , . ip : D(AM )p × A(M) −→ IR ,

is deﬁned by

hµ, f ip ≡ hFα∗(µ), (F −1

α )Uα(f|Uα)iF 0

α(Uα)

,

where (Uα, Fα) is a chart on AM at p. By Prop.3.4.4 the deﬁnition above is independent
of the choice of a chart at p. Extending formula (47) by linearity one gets the pairing

h . , . iM : D(AM ) × A(M) −→ IR .

As a consequence of Prop.3.4.4 and Prop.3.4.5 one has

Proposition 4.4.1 Let D(AM ) be the smooth coalgebra of a supermanifold AM .

1. For all f, g ∈ A(M)0 ∪ A(M)1, µ ∈ D(AM )

(47)

(48)

hµ, f · giM =

(−1)|f |·|µ(2)|hµ(1), f iM hµ(2), giM ,

X(µ)

hµ, 1iM = εM (µ)

,

where ∆M µ =

µ(1) ⊗ µ(2).

2. Let F = (F 0, F.) : AM → BN be a morphism of supermanifolds. Then

for all µ ∈ D(AM ), f ∈ B(N).

hF∗µ, f iN = hµ, FN f iM ,

Using Prop.A.5.6 and the above proposition one obtains the following global version of
Prop.3.4.6 [2, 38]

Theorem 4.4.2 The map

D(AM ) ∋ ω −→ hω, . iM ∈ A(M)◦

is an isomorphism of ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

Each superfunction f on a supermanifold AM can be identiﬁed via the pairing (48) with
a superfunction h . , f iM on D(AM ). Assuming this identiﬁcation one has

Proposition 4.4.2 The functor of Prop.4.1.6 restricted to the subcategory SC< of ﬁnite-
dimensional smooth coalgebras

OSC< ∋ M −→ M∧
MSC< ∋ Φ −→ Φ∗ = (Φ0, Φ∗

M = (M, M( . )∧) ∈ OSM ,
. ) ∈ MSM ,

is an equivalence of categories and the inverse to the functor of Th.4.4.1.

Appendix

A.1 Graded spaces

A ZZ2-graded space is a vector space V with distinguished subspaces V0, V1 such that V
is the direct sum V0 ⊕ V1 of V0 and V1. V0, V1 are called the even and the odd part of V ,
respectively. Similarly, an element v ∈ V is called even if v ∈ V0 and odd if v ∈ V1. Any
element v ∈ V has a unique representation as a sum v = v0 + v1 of its even v0 ∈ V0 and
odd v1 ∈ V1 components. An element v ∈ V0 ∩ V1 is called homogeneous. If v ∈ Vi, v 6= 0
the parity |v| of a homogeneous element v is deﬁned by |v| = i ∈ ZZ2.

Let V, W be ZZ2-graded spaces. The space Hom(V, W ) of all linear maps from V to W
gets the natural grading

Hom(V, W ) = Hom(V, W )0 ⊕ Hom(V, W )1

,

where f ∈ Hom(V, W )i if f (Vj) ⊂ Wi+j. A morphism of ZZ2-graded spaces is an even
linear map (i.e. an element of Hom(V, W )0).

A graded subspace W ⊂ V of a ZZ2-graded space V is a vector subspace of V with the
ZZ2-grading given by W = (W ∩ V0) ⊕ (W ∩ V1).

The direct sum V ⊕ W of ZZ2-graded spaces V, W is the direct sum V ⊕ W of vector spaces
V, W with the ZZ2-grading

(V ⊕ W )0 = V0 ⊕ W0

,

(V ⊕ W )1 = V1 ⊕ W1

.

The tensor product V ⊗ W of ZZ2-graded spaces V, W is the tensor product V ⊗ W of
vector spaces with the ZZ2-grading

(V ⊗ W )k =

Vi ⊗ Wj

i+j = k
L
Let V, W be ZZ2-graded spaces. The twisting morphism T : V ⊗W → W ⊗V is a morphisms
of graded spaces deﬁned by

T (v ⊗ w) = (−1)|v||w|w ⊗ v

for all v ∈ V0 ∩ V1, w ∈ W0 ∩ W1.

∆c =

A ZZ2-graded coalgebra C is irreducible if any of two non-zero ZZ2-graded subcoalgebras
have non-zero intersection. A maximal irreducible ZZ2-graded subcoalgebra of C is called
an irreducible component of C. A ZZ2-graded coalgebra is simple if it has no non-zero
proper ZZ2-graded subcoalgebras. A ZZ2-graded coalgebra is pointed if all simple ZZ2-
graded subcoalgebras are 1-dimensional.

The structure theorem for cocomutative coalgebras [40] is also valid in the ZZ2-graded
case [2, 38].

53

Theorem A.3.1 Any cocomutative ZZ2-graded coalgebra is a direct sum of its irreducible
components.

An element g of a ZZ2-graded coalgebra is called group-like if ∆g = g⊗g. We denote the set
of all group-like elements of a ZZ2-graded coalgebra C by G(C). For all g ∈ G(C), IRg ⊂ C0
is a 1-dimensional simple ZZ2-graded subcoalgebra of C. When a ZZ2-graded cocomutative
coalgebra is pointed, each irreducible component Cg of C is uniquely determined by a
unique group-like element g contained in Cg. Then the direct sum decomposition takes
the form

C =

Cg

.

g ∈ G(C)
L

In the case of a pointed irreducible coalgebra C some further structure information is
encoded in so called coradical ﬁltration [40]. We shall brieﬂy describe the ZZ2-graded
version of this construction and theorem [2, 38].

Let g be a group-like element of a ZZ2-graded coalgebra C. An element p ∈ C is called
primitive with respect to g if

∆p = p ⊗ g + g ⊗ p .

We denote the set of all elements p ∈ C primitive with respect to g by Pg(C). Note that
Pg(C) ⊂ Cg, where Cg is the irreducible component containing g. By Prop.A.3.1

C(1)
g = IRg ⊕ Pg(C)

.

In particular Pg(C) is a ZZ2-graded subspace of C. In case of a pointed irreducible ZZ2-
graded coalgebra C we denote by P (C) the space of all primitive elements with respect to
a unique group-like element in C.

Proposition A.3.2 Let C, D be ZZ2-graded cocommutative coalgebras and Φ, Ψ morphisms
of ZZ2-graded coalgebras D → C. Suppose C is pointed irreducible, then f = g if and only
if Im(Φ − Ψ) ∩ P (C) = {o}.

A bigraded coalgebra C is called strictly bigraded if C0 = IR and C1 coincides with the space
P (C) of all primitive elements of C.

Note that the condition C0 = IR implies that a strictly bigraded coalgebra is pointed
irreducible. The relation between the ZZ+-grading and the coradical ﬁltration in strictly
bigraded coalgebras is given by the following

Deﬁnition A.4.1 A system (B, µ, u, ∆, ε) where B is a ZZ2-graded space and µ, u, ∆, ε
are morphisms of ZZ2-graded spaces

µ : B ⊗ B −→ B
u : IR −→ B

∆ : B −→ B ⊗ B
ε : B −→ IR

is called a ZZ2-graded bialgebra if

1. (B, µ, u) is a ZZ2-graded algebra.

2. (B, ∆, ε) is a ZZ2-graded coalgebra.

3. ∆ and ε are morphisms of ZZ2-graded algebras.

Note that condition 3. can be replaced by requirement that µ and u are morphisms of
ZZ2-graded coalgebras.

Deﬁnition A.4.2 A bigraded bialgebra is a ZZ2-graded bialgebra which is both a bigraded
algebra and bigraded coalgebra with respect to the same ZZ+-grading.

A bigraded bialgebra is called cocommutative, pointed, irreducible, strictly bigraded, if it
is so with respect to its coalgebra structure.

Deﬁnition A.4.3 A ZZ2-graded bialgebra H is called a ZZ2-graded Hopf algebra if there

A.5 Dual coalgebras

Let (A, M, u) be an algebra over IR with multiplication M : A ⊗ A → A and unit
u : IR → A. We denote by A◦ the subspace of the full algebraic dual A′ consisting of all
elements α ∈ A′ such that kerα contains a coﬁnite ideal of A.

Proposition A.5.1 Let A, B be ZZ2-graded algebras and F : A → B a morphism of
ZZ2-graded algebras. Then:

1. A◦ is a linear subspace of A′.

2. Let F ′ : B′ → A′ be dual to F : A → B. Then F ′(B◦) ⊂ A◦.

3. A◦ ⊗ B◦ = (A ⊗ B)◦.

A◦ ⊗ A◦.

4. Let M ′ : A → (A ⊗ A)′ be the dual to the multiplication in A. Then M ′(A◦) ⊂

Proposition A.5.2 Let (A, M, u) be a ZZ2-graded algebra over IR. Then the maps

∆ ≡ M ′
ε ≡ u′

|A◦ : A◦ −→ A◦ ⊗ A◦
|A◦ : A◦ −→ IR ,

,

deﬁne on A◦ a structure of ZZ2-graded coalgebra. If A is ZZ2-graded commutative then A◦
is ZZ2-graded cocommutative.

Deﬁnition A.5.1 The coalgebra (A◦, ∆, ε) of Prop.A.5.2 is called the dual coalgebra of
(A, M, u).

The following property of (A◦, ∆, ε) may serve as independent deﬁnition of dual coalgebra.

Proposition A.5.3 A◦ is the maximal coalgebra in A′ i.e. if for α ∈ A′, M ′(α) ∈ A′ ⊗A′
then α ∈ A◦.

The dual coalgebras of ZZ2-graded algebras of superfunctions on BLK supermanifolds have
been analysed in [2, 38]. Here we brieﬂy present structure results used in the main text.

Proposition A.5.4 Let A(M) be the ZZ2-graded algebra of superfunctions on a super-
manifold AM . Then

1. A(M)◦ is a pointed ZZ2-graded cocomutative coalgebra.

2. Each group-like element of A(M)◦ is of the form

δp = hp, . i : A(M) ∋ f −→ f 0(p) ∈ IR ,

for some p ∈ M.

By the structure theorem for pointed ZZ2-graded cocomutative coalgebras (Th.A.3.1), one
has

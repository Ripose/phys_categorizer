1. Deriving the relativistic velocity addition law without using the 

 
Abstract. We consider a scenario that involves a machine gun, the bullets it fires and a 
moving target, considered from the rest frame of the machine gun and from the rest frame 
of  the  target  respectively.  Involving  the  special  relativity  via  its  two  postulates  and  the 
time dilation formula we derive the relativistic velocity addition law showing that it leads 
to the Lorentz transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same event. 
 
 
 
Lorentz transformations 
 
Many derivations of the relativistic addition law of parallel velocities 
 
without use of the Lorentz Transformations (LT) are known.1,2,3,4,5  Some of 
them  are  based  on  thought  experiments  that  require  knowledge  of  the  time 
dilation and the length contraction effects1,4,5. Other derivations involve the 
Doppler Effect in the optic domain considered from three inertial reference 
frames  in  relative  motion.6  A  few  derivations  simply  involve  only  the 
principle of constancy of the light velocity2. Such derivations are interesting 
for the teaching of special relativity theory since the relativistic addition of 
velocities leads directly to the LT.7 
 
The  derivation  we  propose  is  based  on  a  machine  gun  -  target 
analogy8  of  the  acoustic  Doppler  Effect,  considered  from  the  rest  frame  of 
the  machine  gun  and  from  the  rest  frame  of  the  target.  This  derivation 
involves special relativity via the formula that accounts for the time dilation 
effect which in turn is a direct consequence of the two relativistic postulates 
as it is best shown by the thought experiment that involves two light clocks 
in relative motion.9 
The scenario we follow involves a stationary machine gun (MG) located at 
the origin O of its rest frame I(XOY) and a target T located at x=x’=0 when 
t=t’=0 and moving with constant velocity V in the positive direction of the 
OX axis9. The machine gun fires successive bullets at constant time intervals 
∆ = −   measured  as  a  difference  between  the  readings  of  a  clock 
0C  
located  in  front  of  the  MG,  which  by  definition  represents  a  proper  time 
interval. The bullets move with constant velocity U in the positive direction

Let I’(X’O’Y’) be the rest frame of the target. There the machine gun 
 
moves with velocity V in the negative direction of the axes O’X’, whereas 
the bullets move with velocity U’ in the positive direction. We equate in this 
case the distance traveled by the machine gun in the time interval ∆te and the

In this case ∆ et′  represents a time interval measured as a difference between

Eliminating  et  and  rt′  between (4) and (8) we obtain that the velocities of the 
same bullet relative to I and respectively to I’ are related by

velocities. 
 
Consider  the  moving  bullet  from  the  stationary  reference  frame  I  of 
the  machine  gun.  After  a  given  time  of  motion  the  bullet  hits  a  target  and 
generates  the  event  E(x=Ut,y=0,t=x/U)  whereas,  when  detected  from  I’  it 
generates  the  event  E’(x’=U’t’,y’=0,t’=x’/U’).  The  motion  of  the  bullet  is 
described in I by 
 
 
x Ut=
and in I’ by 
 
 
 
respecting  the  initial  conditions  (t=t’=0,  x=x’=0).  The  scenario  we  follow 
ensures  the  fact  that  the  two  events  take  place  at  the  same  point  in  space 
when  the  clocks  C(x=Ut,y=0)  and  C’(x’=U’t’,y’=0)  located  at  that  point 
read t and respectively t’ or, as relativists would say, they represent the same 
event.

where f(V) represents an unknown function of the relative velocity but not 
of the space-time coordinates of the events involved. This guess is based on 
the logical evidence that the transformation equations (14) and (15) should 
be linear, in order to transform the uniform motion of the bullet in one of the 
reference frames into a uniform motion in the second frame. We obtain the 
algebraic  structure  of  f(V)  by  imposing  the  condition  that  for  U’=0  (15) 
accounts for the time dilation i.e. 

Thus  we  have  derived  the  Lorentz  transformations  for  the  space  time 
coordinates  of  an  event  generated  by  the  same  bullet  as  detected  from  two 
inertial reference frames in relative motion taking place at the same point in 
space when the synchronized clocks of the two frames located at that point 
read  t  and  t’  respectively.  Under  such  conditions  relativists  say  that  the 
Lorentz transformation relates the space-time coordinates of the same event. 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
 
A  simple  and  transparent  scenario  considered  from  two  inertial 
reference frames in relative motion and special relativity involved via its two 
postulates and time dilation leads to the relativistic addition law of parallel 
velocities  which  leads  at  its  turn  in  a  transparent  way  to  the  Lorentz 
transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same event. We found  
a  direct  and  simple  inference  way  that  starts  with  the  two  relativistic

relativistic velocity addition  law  to  finally  reveal  another  deduction  for  the 
Lorenz transformations.

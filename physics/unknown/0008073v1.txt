CCT, A CODE TO AUTOMATE THE DESIGN OF COUPLED CAVITIES *

P. D. Smith, General Atomics, Los Alamos, NM 87544, USA

Abstract

The CCT (Coupled Cavity Tuning) code automates the
RF  calculations  and  sizing  of  RF  cavities  for  the  CCL
(Coupled Cavity Linac) structures of APT.  It is planned
to extend the code to the CCDTL (Coupled Cavity Drift
Tube  Linac).    The  CCT  code  controls  the  CCLFISH
code, a member of the Poisson Superfish series of codes
[1].    CCLFISH  performs  RF  calculations  and  tunes  the
geometry of individual cavities, including an accelerating
cavity  (AC)  and  a  coupling  cavity  (CC).    CCT  also
relates  the  AC  and  CC  by  means  of  equations  that
describe  the  coupling  slot  between  cavities.    These
equations  account  for  the  direct  coupling,  the  next
nearest  neighbor  coupling  between  adjacent  AC’s,  and
the frequency shifts in the AC and CC caused by the slot.
Given  design  objectives  of  a  coupling  coefficient  k,  the
pi/2  mode  frequency,  and  the  net  frequency  of  the  CC,
the CCT code iterates to solve for the geometry of the AC
and  CC  and  the  separation  distance  between  them  (this
controls  the  slot  size),  satisfying  the  design  objectives.
The  resulting  geometry  is  used  to  automate  CAD
drawing preparation.  The code can also be used in “as-
designed” mode to calculate the frequencies and coupling
of a specified configuration.  An overview of the code is
presented.

calculations  and  slot  coupling  calculations,  as  will  be
explained in more detail in section 2.4.

The  design  was  formerly  done  by  manually  iterating
between  CCLFISH  runs  and  slot  calculations,  using  a
spread sheet to control the process.  If each segment were
designed  this  way,  up  to  6  weeks  per  segment  and  40
man years for the complete accelerator could be required.
Fortunately,  one  can  simplify  this  by  designing  fewer
segments, tuning the cavities and the slot insertion with
the  aid  of  cold  models,  and  interpolating  the  tuned
geometry between segments, as is now standard practice.
With  the  CCT  code,  a  lower  cost  approach  can  be
used.  Now, each design calculation can be performed in
minutes rather than weeks, so it is possible to tune each
segment  analytically. 
interpolating  the
geometry, the approach is to interpolate empirical factors
used in the coupling calculations.  The empirical factors
may  be  estimated  fairly  accurately  with  fewer,  simpler
cold  models  and  the  use  of  3-D  RF  calculations  to
supplement the experiments [2].

  Instead  of 

Regardless  of  the  strategy  to  be  employed  for  cold
models  and  interpolation,  the  CCT  code  has  enabled  a
significant reduction in effort per design calculation, and
it  has  permitted  us  to  perform  many  more  design
calculations  than  would  otherwise  be  possible,  to
investigate different design approaches and tuning.

1  REASONS FOR DEVELOPMENT

2  DESCRIPTION OF THE CCT CODE

The development of CCT was undertaken to speed up
the  design  and  tuning  of  coupled  cavities  in  the  Low
Energy  Linac  of  APT.    The  Low  Energy  Linac,  which
accelerates  a  cw  beam  of  protons  to  212  MeV,  is
subdivided  into  341  segments,  each  of  which  has  a
unique cavity design (AC, CC, and slot).

The design objective is to specify the frequencies of the
AC and CC and the coupling constant k and to solve for
the  cavity  geometry  that  achieves  this.    Each  AC  has  a
specified length and gap (defined by the Parmila code).
The  AC  diameter  is  tuned  using  CCLFISH.    Each  CC
has a specified length and diameter.  The CC post gap is
tuned using CCLFISH.  The geometry of the slot between
each AC-CC pair is a function of the unknown AC and
CC  dimensions  and  the  separation  distance  between
cavities.  The slot geometry influences both the coupling
coefficient k and the net frequencies of the AC and CC.
Therefore,  to  obtain  a  consistent  design  solution,  it  is
tuning

The  half  cavities  are  nominally 

symmetrical,
representing 
structure.
Asymmetry can be introduced by an option to specify the
frequency shift of the “opposite” coupling slot manually.
In  the  accelerator,  the  cavity  plates  (Fig. 1)  are
assembled  with  adjacent  AC’s  back-to-back,  creating  a
CC between them.  The AC’s communicate magnetically
through their common CC, giving rise to “next-nearest-
neighbor coupling”  between  them.    This  causes  the p /2
mode  frequency  to  be  lower  than  the  average  AC
frequency  (see  Eq.  2).    Adjacent  coupling  cavities,
however,  are  rotated  180(cid:176)   apart,  so  the  next-nearest-
neighbor coupling between two CC’s is negligible.

The RF model used by CCLFISH (which is called by
CCT)  is  axisymmetric,  i.e.,  the  slot  is  absent.    The
frequency  shift  and  coupling  effects  of  the  slot  are
calculated  separately  by  CCT.    To  do  this,  CCT  must
first calculate the geometry of the slot (length, width, and
chamfer  thickness)  from  the  dimensions  of  the  cavities
and their center-to-center distance.  Although the actual
slot  is  a  three-dimensional  surface  intersection,  the  key
slot  dimensions  (length  and  width)    can  be  calculated
exactly  using 
  The
chamfer  thickness  of  the  slot  is  calculated  by  an
approximation  that  is  corrected  with  the  aid  of  a  3-D
CAD model.

The slot geometry calculations are too complicated to
present  here  in  detail  –  several  combinations  of  surface
intersections are possible.  Fig. 2 illustrates the geometry
of the slot width calculation  for one case.

2.2  Accounting for Frequency Shifts

and frequency shifts.

absence of a coupling slot,  SFf

2. A finite mesh correction term,

2.3  Slot Coupling Equations

The effects of the coupling slot are based on theoretical
approaches presented by Gao [3] (for the frequency shifts
and  the  direct  coupling,  k)  and  Greninger  [4]  (for  the
next nearest neighbor coupling,  kk).  These, in turn, are
based on the Slater perturbation theory.  The theoretical
equations  are  adjusted  by  empirical  “A”  factors  to
account  for  the  fact  that  the  perturbation  theory  is  not
exact.  Following is a summary of the equations used.

2.4  Solution Logic

The logic used to obtain a consistent, coupled solution

for both the AC and the CC is as follows:

1. Specify values for the cavity dimensions, including

those that will later be adjusted by CCLFISH.

2. Assume values of the frequency shifts caused by the

slots and the next-nearest-neighbor coupling.

3. Starting  with  the  design  objective 

p /2  mode
frequency  and  CC  net  frequency,  work  backward
through  Eqs.  (1)  and  (2)  to  calculate  the  shifted
CCLFISH target frequencies,  SFf

4. Run  CCLFISH  to  tune  the  AC  and  CC  to  meet
these shifted target frequencies.  This modifies the
cavity diameters or gaps.

5. Assume  a  center-to-center  distance  between  the

.

tuned cavities.

6. Given the geometries of the tuned cavities and the
assumed  center-to-center  distance,  calculate  the
geometry of the knife edge slot.

Agreement  between  design  and  experiment  has  been
good,  although  the  perturbation  theory  has  limitations.
Improved accuracy is expected when we use 3-D analysis
to refine estimates of the “A” factors.

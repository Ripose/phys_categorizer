          Dependencies of levitation position of positively charged fine-particles on plasma parameters are 

investigated. The charges on the particles become positive in a cross-field sheath between magnetized 

double plasmas with different potentials separated vertically by horizontal magnetic field, because ion 

current  flowing  from  a  lower  high-potential  plasma  surpasses  electron  current  coming  across  the 

magnetic field from an upper low-potential plasma. From measurement of the resonance frequency of 

the particles driven by external oscillating electric field, the charge on particle is estimated to be of the 
order of 102. Variation of particle levitation positions can be explained by the change of the charges. 
   

   

I. Introduction   

        Dusty  plasma  containing  fine  particles  of  micron  size  introduced  into  weakly  ionized  plasmas 

reveal various characteristic phenomena concerned with a strongly coupled state of dusty plasmas [1]. 

Formations  of  Coulomb  crystals,  dynamic  motion  of  Coulomb  fluid,  and  various  wave  phenomena 

have been reported. By employing a completely dc-discharge plasma, it becomes possible to control the 

behavior  of  fine  particles  more  systematically  [2].  The  effects  of  vertical  magnetic  field  on  the 

fine-particle  behaviors  were  also  investigated  and  a  rotational  motion  of  fine-particle  cloud  has  been 

observed  [3].  Recently,  in  order  to  eliminate  the  effect  of  the  gravity  acting  on  the  particles, 

microgravity  experiments  have  been  proposed,  and  characteristic  features  of  fine  particle  behaviors 

have been discovered [4,5]. Under the microgravity condition using a parabolic flight experiment we 

have observed formations of fine-particle cloud with a spherical void inside and spherical fine-particle 

cloud with no void inside, respectively [6].   

        Although  almost  all  previous-experiments  are  concerned  with  negatively  charged  fine  particles, 

we have reported the formation and levitation of positively charged fine particles by using irradiation of 

slow positive beam ions to the particles [7]. The positive ions with large ionization potential subtract 

electrons  from  the  neutral  particles  to  create  positively  charged  particles,  and  as  a  result  the  positive 

beam ions turn to neutral. 

2. Experimental apparatus and method 

        Figure  1  shows  a  schematic  of  the  experimental  apparatus.  Double  plasmas  (upper  and  lower 

plasmas)  are  produced  independently  along  the  horizontal  magnetic  field  by  dc  discharges  with 

different  anode  potentials  and  separated  in  the  vertical  direction  by  a  cross-field  sheath.  The 

cathode-anode distance in both plasmas is 4 cm. The anode potential of the upper plasma is grounded, 

while  dc  bias  voltage  VA  can  be  applied  to  the  anode  of  the  lower  plasma.  When  VA  >  0,  we  can 
produce  electric  field  directed  upward  in  the  cross-field  sheath  region.  In  order  to  avoid  a  mixing  of

both  plasmas,  the  strength  of  the  horizontal  magnetic  field  is  kept  in  the  range  B  =  0.9  –  1.4  kG. 

Therefore, we can fix the upper plasma potential almost grounded even when positive VA = 10 - 60 V is 
applied to the anode of the lower plasma. Details are described in [7].

3. Experimental results and discussions 

       

        Dependency  of  floating  potential  profile 

VF  in  vertical  position  z  on  the  discharge 
current  of  the  upper  plasma  IDU  is  shown  in 
Fig.  2,  where  vertical  coordinate  z  is  counted 

from the lower edge of the side wall. Here, the 

cross-field sheath region is 0 < z < L = 10 mm. 

Typically, B = 1 kG, VA = 30 V and PAr = 20 
Pa. In the lower plasma for z < 0 the floating 

       

potential  VF  become  positive  and  almost 
uniform in region of –10 mm < z < 0. On the 

other hand, in the upper plasma for z > 10 mm 

the  potential  VF  becomes  negative  and  is 
almost  fixed  at  ∼  -8  V.  The  potential  varies 

monotonically  in  vertical  direction  and  the 

 

 

 

 

 

electric  field  directed  upward  is  formed.  In 

this  potential  configuration  particle  cloud  is 

trapped  and  levitated  above  the  levitation 

electrode 

to  form  Coulomb  crystal  with 

spacing  of  ∼  0.3  mm.  Here,  the  plasma 

densities  in  the  upper  and  lower  plasmas  are 
4.2 × 107 /cm3 and 1.4 × 108 /cm3, respectively. 
The  average  electron  temperature  in  both 

plasmas is ~2.6 eV. 

        We  measured  the  variation  of  particle 

positions  above  the  levitation  electrode  as  a 

function  of  the  discharge  current  IDU  of  the 
upper  plasma.  The  position  of  the  particles  is 

shifted  downward  with  an  increase  in  the 

discharge current IDU. The following charging 
model  can  explain  this  behavior.  Since  the 

     
      
     

collision mean free path λC (≈ 0.4 mm) of ions 
with  neutral  atoms  is  much  shorter  than  the

cross-field  sheath  width  L  (=  10  mm),  the  ions  have  to  suffer  many  collisions  during  their  motion 

across the sheath. Therefore, energy distribution function fi(W) of ions impinging on the fine particles is 
2, 
not a monochromatic, but has an energy spread of the order of WC/e ≈ (λC /L)VA. Here, W = (1/2)miui
mi is the ion mass, and ui is the ion velocity. That is, the ions with energy eφd < W can overcome the 
particle  potential  φd.  But,  the  ions  with  energy  0  <  W  <  eφd  are  reflected  by  the  positive  particle

potential φd. Since the particles are levitated in the sheath, the condition Ii = Ie for the ion and electron 
currents flowing into the particles has to be satisfied in the steady state. Therefore, when the electron 

current Ie coming across the magnetic field from the upper plasma is increased by the increase in the 
discharge current, φd has to be decreased consequently to enhance Ii to make it equal to the increase in 
Ie.  Then,  the  charge  Qd  on  the  particles  decreases,  which  shifts  the  particles  downward  direction  for 
getting a stronger electric field E to satisfy the force balance equation QdE ≈ mdg = constant. Here, g 
and md are gravity constant and mass of the particle, respectively. 
          In  order  to  evaluate  the  charge  on  the  fine  particles  we  applied  small  amplitude  voltage  at 

frequency ω to the levitation electrode biased at VL [8]. By changing the frequency ω we measure the 
amplitude of the particles oscillating in vertical direction. The charge can be measured by the resonance 

frequency and the profile of external electric field. The equation of motion of a particle in the sheath is

        This means that the charge can be estimated 

from  the  resonance  frequency  ω0  and  the  first 
derivative of the electric field dE(z0)/dz which can 
be  obtained  from  Fig.  2.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2  the 

floating  potential  distribution  in  the  sheath  is 

almost independent of the discharge current IDU of 
the upper plasma. 

        Figure 3 shows the amplitude of the particle 

 

oscillation as a function of ω. It is shown that the 

    (b) 

particles  resonate  around  21  Hz.  Dependence  of 

the  resonance  frequency  ω0  on  the  discharge 
current  IDU  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(a).  It  is  found  that 
the  resonance  frequency  ω0  increases  with  a 
decrease in IDU. Figure 4(b) shows the variation of 
charge Q/e as a function of IDU. We find that Q/e 
decreases with an increase in IDU. In the previous 
report [7] we have shown that the decrease in the 

discharge  current  of  the  upper  plasma  results  in 

the downward shift of the particle position. Since 

the electric field in the down side region becomes 

larger,  the  charge  should  be  decreased  to  balance 

    

with the gravity. These results are consistent with 

the  result  in  Fig.  4(b).  Therefore,  the  levitation 

model  of  the  positive  charged  particle  described 

here  is  quite  appropriate.  Finally,  we  should  note 

 

 

that the  diameter of the particles  used  here  is  1.5

µm and the charge Q/e is estimated to be 220 – 170. This amount of charges is also consistent with the 
charges of 103 –104 for the negatively charged fine particles of 10 µm in diameter in the conventional 
plasmas [2]. 

4. Conclusions 

      We have established a confinement of positively charged particles levitated in the cross-field sheath 

between magnetized double plasmas. Application of double plasmas and horizontal magnetic field is a 

key technique for producing upward directed electric field decreasing in the vertical position. We have 

also  measured  the  positive  charges  on  the  particles  by  applying  oscillating  potential  to  the  levitation 
electrode. From the resonance frequency the charge Q/e, estimated to be of the order of 102, decreases 
with an increase in the discharge current of the upper plasma. This dependency is consistent with the

particle behavior in vertical direction. The shift of the particle positions can be explained by the change 

of the charge, caused by the change of the electron flux absorbed by the particles.

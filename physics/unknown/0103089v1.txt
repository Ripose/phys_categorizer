Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU  Concept)  opens  new  wide  possibilities  for  the  effective  description  of 
Elementar  Objects  of  Matter  (EOM)  hierarchy,  in  particular,  of  particles,  resonances  mass  spectrum  of 
subatomic (and HEP) physics. 

The  special  attention  to  analysis  and  precise  description  of  wide  and  important  set  -  transitive  states 

(resonances) of EOM is payed. 

 Its are obtained sufficiently precise representations for mass values, cross relations between masses of 
wide  set  objects  of  particle  physics  -  metastable  resonances  -  (fast  moving)  transitive  states  -  in  terms  of 
representations of Wave Universe Concept (WU Concept).  

Wide  set  of  observed  in  experiments  effects  and  connected  with  its  resonances  (including  -  Darmstadt 
effect, ABC effect,etc.) may be effectively interpreted in WU Concept and described with use of mass formula 
- as manifestation of rapidly moving, physically distinguished transitive states (resonances). 
 
DISCRETENESS, COMMENSURABILITY,  
QUANTIZATION of WAVE DYNAMIC SYSTEMS (WDS) 
 

According to ideas of Wave Universe Concept (WU Concept) [Chechelnitsky, 1980-1998], (any) arbitrary 
real    objects  of    micro  (atoms,  particles)  and  megaworld  (astronomical  systems)  represent  principally  -  the 
wave dynamic systems (WDS). 

In that case the following assertion is valid. 
Proposition 
#  Internal  structure,  geometry,  dynamics,  physics  of  WDS  are  essentially  connected  with    observated 

effects of discreteness, commensurability, quantization of its dynamical parameters. 

# That, first of all, relates to discreteness, commensurability, quantization of two sets conjugated   values 

(parameters) 

*  Sectorial velocities (circulations) L=LN
*  Keplerian (orbital) velocities v=vN

#  Nature  "prefers"  to  manifest  (it's  activity)  at  some  dynamically,  physically  distinguished    (with  most 
probability observed) values of dynamical parameters, - first of all, at elite (dominant) values of (sectiorial and 
keplerian) velocities. 

These special states are the most simple, easily detectable ones - even at preliminary heuristic analysis of 
discreteness  and  commansurability.  By  its  -  usually  and  first  of  all  -  having  physical    intuition    researchers  
"come  across"  in their search investigations.

Motion  of  transitive  state  (resonance)  may  naturally  arise  in  framework  of  following  simple  intuitive 

consideration.

Notion of transitive may be extended at more wide class of objects. 
Let some  ("complex") state (resonance) disintegrates into a few moving (stationary) states. 
Using  conservation  laws  (of  energy,  etc.)  it  may  be  restored,  reconstructed  the  initial    "complex"

For this initial state it may be saved  "transitive" term (transitive state, resonance), taking into account the 

way of it's  reconstruction - by scuttering, moving decay products, with essential regarding for its velocities. 
 
Transitive States (Resonances). Mass Formulae 

Using  the  standard  representations  of  (relativistic)  kinematics  it  is  not  difficult  to  receive  the

Decay Processes. 
Resonance "Reconstruction".  Binary Decay 

The  simplest  situation  -  resonance  decay  into  two  identifical  with  equal  m0  masses  and      equal  P=mv  - 
momenta  (impulses)  (m-mass,  v-vellocity)  -  gives  a  possibility  to  obtain  the  simplest  representation  for  the 
mass of disintegreting resonance 

 = M#(1+b 2
)
Of  course,  similar  representation  is  justify  when  taking  into  account  all  circumstances  of  decay,  that

In collaiders experiments where collision of identical particles takes places, evidently, it may  be expected 
the  appearance  of  transitive  states  (resonances)  in  the  indicated  above  sense  (as  generating  by  collading, 
moving particles).  

And then, as in the case of reconstruction by moving components in mass formula, it may be used as M#

Megaworld and Microworld (Quasars and Particles).  

Proposition. 
The  spectrum  of  physically  distinguished  elite  velocities  vN

and  quantum  numbers  N  of  arbitrary  wave 
dynamic systems (WDS) has the some universal peculiarity. It is practically identical - universal (invariant) for 
all known observed systems of Universe (of megaworld and microworld ). 

[s] 

In particular, velocities spectrum of experimentally well investigated Solar and satellite systems practically 
coincides for observed planetary and satellite - dominant orbits, corresponding to some (dominant) values of 
quantum numbers NDom. Thus it may be expected, that spectrum of elite (dominant - planetary) velosities of 
the Solar system (well identificated by observations) may be effectivelly used as quite representive - internal 
(endogenic) - spectrum of physically distinguiched, well observed - elite (dominant) velocities, for example, of 
far  astronomical  systems  of  Universe  [Chechelnitsky,  1986,  1997]  and  of  wave  dynamic  systems  (WDS)  - 
elementary objects of subatomic physics.

We once more repit in the compact form the important conclusion which was obtained in the monograph

#  Detectable  in  experiments  and  observations  velocities  of  real  systems  of  Universe  -  from  objects  of

THEORY, OBSERVATIONS, EXPERIMENTS 
 

Two problems will lie in field of our attention below. 
# If are known, fixed in observations and experiments any facts, that prove argue a reality of existence of 

theory effects of velocities discreteness, commensurability, quantization? 

# How much effective, in frame of theory (WU Concept), is the description of mass spectrum  of transitive 

resonances objects, that are close connected with consequant decay to rapidly moving components? 
 
Phenomenon of Velocities Discreteness 

Effects of velocities discreteness in experiments of subatomic phisics, apparently, appeared long ago, but, 

indeed, conceptually its were not "observed" till now. 
This is the situation, which is typical for science. 
Results  of  experiments,  at  first,  must  be  comrehended  in  frame  of  any  theoretical  representations,  of 

arbitrary conceptual expectations in order to that facts, properly, will be taken into consideration. 

Otherwise its remain unnoticed and sink in array of suppress by its volume information. 
It  is  very  important,  that  only  on  the  base  of  some  expectation  any  successful  experiments  may  be 

constructed. 

This theme is interesting by itself and we hope, may be, to return to it afterwards (later or subsequently). 
Let us point out (indicate) only several facts and investigations of last time. 

 
Observations in Space 
Quantizations of Velocities and Redshifts of Astronomical Systems 

Information  about  existence  of  distinguished  velocities  spectrum  most  brightly,  evidently,  (as  that  often 
occur in the history of science) for a long time enters from area of study of megasystem - beside from close - 
Solar  system  [Chechelnitsky,  1980-1998],  but  from  distant  -  galaxies,  quasars  [Burbidge,  1967,  1968;  Tifft 
and Cocke, 1984; Arp et al, 1990; Chechelnitsky, 1997]. 

In  fact,  namely  in  the  world  of  astronomical  systems,  frequantly,  important  phenomena  in      particular   

descriptive, unmuddy form are fixed. 

The question is about observations of preferable velocities of not only celestial bodies, but also of plasma, 
that  is  high  speed  particles  flows  inside  astronomical  systems.  The  last  is  evident  from  the  fact,  that  the 

Chechelnitsky A.M.   Motion, Universality of Velocities, Masses in Wave Universe. 
                                    Transitive States (Resonances) – Mass Spectrum.                                                     6 

 

discreteness  phenomena  are  connected  with  velocities,  that  essentially  exceed  all  conceivable  admissible 
limits of velocities of large celestial bodies. 

By  such  high  (subluminal)  velocitites  only  motions  of  plasma,  highenergetic  particles  may  be 

So, even only on the base of similar facts and its comrehend in the frame of WU Concept we can regard, 
that real objects, components of its decay "prefer" to move with some physical distinguished - elite (dominant) 
velocities [Chechelnitsky, 1997]. 

characterized. 

 

Particles and Quasars 

It  is  interesting  to  point  that  above  mentioned  representation  z=v2/c2  describes  (in  megaworld)  the 

redshifts of quasars and galaxies [Chechelnitsky, 1997]. 
It may be shown - this is not accidental coincidence. 

 
Experiments on the Earth 

But,  it  is  clear,  of  course,  that  it  is  interesting  to  detect  the  effects  of  velocities  discreteness, 
commensurability, quantization not so far - in Space, but - in immediate nearness, at a short distance - at the 
Earth, in physical laboratories. 

Already  now,  even  without  of  specially  oriented,  purposeful  experiments  it  may  be  suggested,  that  in 
physical experiments effects were fixed, which may be interpreted as phenomena of velocities discreteness, 
commensurability. 

Undoubtedly, this topic deserves of the special investigation in history of science (physics). 

 
Effects of Discreteness, Commensurability in Decay Reactions 
"Well forgotten" old. Radioactive decay. 

Still  the  pioneers  -  investigators  of  radioactivity  remarked  a  set  of  interesting  peculiarities,  by  which  the 

radioactive decay was characterized, in particular, it was remarked [Dorfman, 1979]: 

"It  was  shown,  that  all  a

  -  particles,  thrown  by  one  radioactive  radiation,  have  identical  run  length  and 

identical for this radiative velocity [Reserford, 1905] ".   

In particular, Reserford [Reserford, 1972, p.77] remarked: "We see, that issuing velocity of a -particles of 
9
9
  and  2.25(cid:215) 10
differ  radioactive  matters  lay  in  enough  narrow  interval,  between  1.59(cid:215) 10
  cm/s".  (P.75):  "All 
9

initial issuing velocities of products of radioactive elements lay between  1.59(cid:215) 10
 and 2.25(cid:215) 10

the maximal issuing velocity is only in 1.44 times larger than the minimal velocity."  

This Reseford observation finds an interesting comment in this discussed approach of WU Concept. 
The observating  limits of velocities correspond  to the dominant values in Shell G

There are many another important results of interesting. 
Such  brilliant  experiments  passed  as  unremarked  by  theory,  proved  to  be  out  of  mainstream  of 

fundamental  representations of standard science. 

Evidently, generally  accepted  representations  possess  by special selection. 
We  discovered  for  ourselves  the  results  of  such  buried  experiments,  becouse  looked  for  namely  these

"Unremarked" New 

Let us  point results only one experiment conducted in Dubna [Avdeychikov, Nikitin, 1987,1988]: 
"...In  range  of  low  kinematic  energy  of  the  Ef  -  fragment  the  endow  of  source  with  limit  velocity  b
dominates, in range of high energy - with b
2=0.08 c, where c - the light velocity. The pointed values b
are characteristic for all z - fragments and energies of a beam."  

1=0.02c

This observations of experimentators are extraordinary and a'priori - far not evident. 
Really,  why  the  whole  set  of  fragments,  that  essentially  differ  by  charges  and  energies,    must  have  the 

same velocities of issuing? 

From the formed standard ("probable") representations such conclusion does not follow. 
But  in  frame  of  (WU  Concept)  representations  about  universality  of  velocities  spectrum  -  of  its 
discreteness,    commensurability,  quantization,  presence  of  physically  distinguished  states  -  such  effect  is 
quite expected. 

Moreover,  it  is  really  correct  from  the  point  of  view  of  theory,  because  of  the  observated  velocities 

correspond to the theoretically calculated values

It is interesting point, that information about the same velocity  v £  0.02 c, generating the e+ e- resonances, 

is mentioned in [Koinig, 1993]. 

Another information [Pokotilovsky, 1993]:  
"...Data testify that mass center of probable decaying e+e- system move in center-of- mass of collision ions 

with little velocity, not exceeding 0.03 - 0.05 c." 
 
Latent Possibilities of RPP (Review of Particle Physics)  

Meanwhile, wide possibilities and  reason (cause) for reflections and investigations the most  known 

compendium of experimental data of Particle Physics (RPP) allows, especially when  in  it the data 
concerning to momenta (impulses) of decay modes of particles were ublished. 

Lying at a surface and detecting at purposeful search, the effect of P - momenta (impulses) discreteness 
and  commensurability  (together  with  masses  discreteness)  naturally  leads  to  discovery  of  v  -  velocities 
discreteness, commensurability. 
 
Investigations of Gareev's Group 

Recently,  to  the  indicated  by  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  universal  effects  of  (sectorial  and    Keplerian)  
velocities discreteness,  commensurability (in micro - and megaworld)  Gareev pays special attention [Gareev 
et  al,  1996].  Possessing  by  developed  physical  intuition  and  conducting  wide    work  with  using  of  RPP 
experimental data,  Gareev  and  his  co-workers made convinced in validity of expectations of WU Concept 
for objects of subatomic world too. 

Indeed,  in  a  wide  array  of  particles  decays  the  effect  of  velocities  discreteness,  commensurability  is 

observed, exists, brightly manifests. 

Information (in RPP) about experimentally observed P mass momenta (impulses) and connected with its v 
velocities opens the possibilities to calculate the potentially virtual masses spectrum of resonances by semi - 
empirical way. 

Correlation of computations and experimentally known data is impressionable. 
In  any  case,  such  coinciding  is  a  challenge  to  the  standard  theory  and  a  stimulus  for  further purposeful 

investigations. 

 

What is further? 

(of particles decays)? 

But the heuristic analysis exhausts itself even as the following questions arize: 
# From where these physically distinguished velocities? 
# What must we do without RPP by the hand - i.e. without information about empirical values of velocities 

# Why these velocities, but not another? 
# If exist for its (velocities) any theoretical representations? 
Answers to these questions the Wave Universe Concept gives, in particular, by the Proposition (Theorem) 
about Universality of (physically preferable) elite (dominant) velocities spectrum - for real systems of Universe 
(micro - and megaworld). 
 
Integer Commensurability 

Simplest integer commensurability of observed in experiments (in RPP) velocities

is  entirely  evident  in  frame  of  WU  Concept  and  directly  follows  from  the  principal  representation  for  elite

At the Begining of Way 

If the history experience learns to something, then it is relevant  to note,  that with the comprehension (by 
a  wide  circle  of  physicists  -  professionals)  of  real  existence  of  velocities  discreteness,  commensurability, 
quantization effects, the subatomic physics fixes itself at the  stage, which corresponds (roughly) to the time 
of Roy and Ovenden publication [Roy and Ovenden, 1954], concerning world of megasystems.

DISCUSSION 
 

Estimating the situation, which fully formed in connection with known early interpretation of masses, it is 

inevitably come to conclusion, that the theory is situated at the very origin of way. It is fully possible, that 
discussed above approach will be stimulate more effective advance on that way.  

So two directions represent as actual 
# Investigations of conformities of elite velocities universality in Universe - in micro - and megaworld, 
# Investigations  of  fundamental conformities of resonances and  dynamical spectrum origin. 
With respect to resonances spectrum even available by this time new data permit to suggest the following. 
*  Detectable in experiments states (resonances) are not phantoms, fancies, 
*  To its real physics and wave dynamics correspond, 
*  Its place, status, role in order of another, more known states may be comprehended in frame  of  WU 

Concept. 

Wide  set  of  observed  in  experiments  effects  and  connected  with  its  resonances  (including  -  Darmstadt 
effect  [see  review  Pokotilovsky,  1993],  ABC  effect  [see  review  Codina,  Plouin,  1994],  effects  discussed  by 
Gareev [see review Gareev, Kazacha, 1996; Gareev et al., 1997]) can effectively interpreted in WU Concept 
and  described  with  use  of  mass  formula  -  as  manifestation  of  rapidly  moving,  physically  distinguished 
transitive states (resonances). 

Purposeful  experiments,  stimulated  by  theory,  can  brighten  up  many  important  details  of  Universality  of 
elite velocities in the Universe (including - in microworld), and also can  broaden the spectrum of observed 
resonances. 

There are the serious bases to regard, that results of such experiments will be foreseeing  and  succesful. 

The Wave Universe Concept gives such bases.

Abstract

We find that we cannot assign arbitrarily the equation of state in the hypertoroidal

Universe. Instead, we derive it from the equations of General Relativity. We find that the

cosmic fluid consists of two parts. The first one is our usual matter, which retains a

constant density as the Universe expands, and does not vary as U^(-3), where U is the

scale factor. The second one is a novel unknown constituent, whose density varies as U^

(-6) In this way, on the one hand the Universe remains in a steady state concerning its

material content, and on the other hand the "unknown constituent", resulting from the

equations, could be identified perhaps with dark matter.

1. Introduction

Usually in Relativity, in order to determine a metric, one finds six of the components

of the metric tensor, three components of the four-velocity and the density of matter from

the   ten   Einstein   equations,   assuming   a   suitable   form   for   the   energy-momentum

tensor.Then  he  imposes a   suitable,  but  arbitrary,  equation  of  state and  he finds  the

pressure besides the density of matter [3].

However, one can do what we did in our original paper [1]. We have alltogether 10

Einstein equations. We have also available four degrees of gauge freedom, since the

coordinates  can  be  subjected  to  four   arbitrary  transformations.  Concerning  thus   the

metric, since we determined 8 unknown functions, we were left with two degrees of

2

gauge freedom, since we used the other two in order to arbitrarily asign values to the two

remaining metric components, in particular to set g01 = 0 = g23.

On the other hand, by means of the identity uiui = 1, we were initially left with three

unknowns, for example the spatial components, and finally with only one unknown, say

u1, after utilizing the remaining two degrees of gauge freedom to set u2 = 0 = u3. Thus we

had 8 + 1 = 9 unknowns, and we were left only with one unknown on the whole, the

density ε, or rather the combination p-ε, which we could also find (which we did). Then

we had to impose a suitable, but arbitrary, equation of state to find the pressure p. But,

instead of finding u1 and take p ad hoc, what we did was to take also u1 = 0 (since we

used   comoving   coordinates),   so   that   we   had   to  derive  p,   or   rather   p+ε   (another

combination of ε & p). Evidently wrongly we imposed an equation of state in that paper.

Thus p+ε 1 f had to be found from the {22} Einstein equation in particular, since all

k
;k =
the other Einstein equations had been used. Then we would have in particular that Ti

k
;k  = 0 is  not  identically
0 would be identically satisfied. It turns out however that Ti

satisfied. Instead, as we saw in [1] the {22} Einstein equation is identically satisfied.

k
;k  = 0 results from the Einstein equations, right from this
Thus, since the equation Ti

equation we have to find f, that is to determine the eqation of statte. This is what we will

do in the present paper.

With the values of the various symbols given in the Appendix, we can find uk

ui;0  entering (9). The results are omitted here, but it is straightforward to be found.

Taking from the Appendix the symbols Ai

In other words we have on hands the four-gradient of f in terms of f. Thus, we obtain

(21)

which gives the desired function f. The φi's are given by (18) in terms of the  Bi's.

We have for the Bi's to zeroth order in the ω's

Substituting the φi's from (23) in (21), we find upon integration the final result

Here we have to make a remark. Namely, another constant, say D, has to enter (25).

In fact, if we do the substitutions p ﬁ

 p+D & ε ﬁ

 ε+D, we will still have p-ε given by (2).

But now we have to add a term 2D to the right hand side of (3). We can then solve for f

as we did, and add 2D to the final result. This amounts to adding the term D to both p &

ε given by (25), namely

with α a suitable constant, so that we get for the constant part of (26) the equation of

(32)

Then for α = 3 we obtain the case of dust, for α = 6 we obtain the case of radiation (and

for α = 0 the case of "dark energy"). For the variable part of (26) we have to invent a

new  constituent  of  the  cosmic  fluid  (it   could  be  the  dark  matter  perhaps) with  the

state

4. Discussion

The fact that ε (and p) consists of two terms, one varying as U^(-6) and the other

constant, suggests that the cosmic fluid has two constituents. One of them is certainly the

usual matter (plus usual forms of energy). We cannot specify exactly what the other is.

But, this unknown constituent must certainly exist, and is awaiting its observational

discovery, since it is predicted by the equations (of General Relativity).

However, the problem is which one of the above mentioned two terms corresponds

to (luminous) matter and which to the unknown constituent. We would be tempted to

correspond U^(-6) to matter and the constant term to the unknown constituent. In fact,

people attribute the constant term (with ε = 0) to the so-called "dark energy". But we

cannot accept that U^(-6) corresponds to matter. If this term corresponded to matter we

would expect the exponent to be -3 in the best case. However, in order to explain the

Ryle effect it is necessary to take the (luminous) matter density constant (steady state), as

we did in [2]. And, since the Ryle effect has to be taken as an unambiguous empirical

fact, we are obliged to do so. Thus, it is the unknown constituent which varies as U^(-6).

We have to observe also that f depends on r besides t as well, as we can easily see if

we consider our equations in full generality with no approximations, since r appears in

g00 and g03.

Another remark has to be made concerning the conservation of the total mass inside

V(r). As we saw in the preceding section it is not constant. Actually, neither the total

mass, nor the total "unknown constituent" remains constant. But this is not forbidden,

since  we   know   that   the   vanishing  of   the   covariant   four-divergence  of   the   energy-

called  pseudotensor  of the gravitational field, which means that the conservation law

mentioned applies to the whole system of matter (both [luminous] matter [+radiation]

and the unknown constituent) plus gravitational field [3].

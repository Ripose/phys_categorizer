Abstract

We  show  that  physics  of  multi-GEM  structures  is  rather  complex,  regarding  the  number  of
phenomena  affecting  detector  performance.  The  high-pressure  operation  in  noble  gases  and  the  ion
feedback are considered in more detail. It is proposed that the dominant avalanche mechanism in He
and Ne, at high pressures, is the associative ionization.  Ion feedback effects related to the dependence
on gas, pressure and gain and to possible avalanche extension outside the GEM holes are discussed.

Keywords: Gas Electron Multipliers; noble gases; high pressures; associative ionization; ion feedback.

1.  Introduction

In  recent  years  a  considerable  progress  has
been  made  in  Gas  Electron  Multiplier  (GEM)
[1] detectors, motivated by the growing interest
in  their  potential  applications.  The  advanced
features  of  GEM-based  detectors  are  high
counting rate, excellent spatial resolution, good
imaging capability, operation in magnetic field,
large sensitive area, flexible geometry and low
cost [2].

A unique property of GEMs, as compared to
other micro-pattern detectors, is their capability
to  operate  in  cascade,  i.e.  in  a  multi-GEM
structure.  The  advantages  of  multi-GEM
detectors  comprise:  effective  photon  [3,4]  and

ion  feedback  suppression  [5-7];  high  gains,
reaching  107    [3,4,8];  high  gain  (above  105)
operation in pure noble gases [3] including that
at  high  pressures  [9,10];  discharge  prevention
in  intense  particle  beams  [11];  optical  readout
directly on CCD-based sensors [12]; good time
resolution,  down  to  1  ns  for  single  electron
counting mode [4]; operation in a sealed mode
[6];  reduced  ageing  rate  [6,13],  operation  with
CsI-coated GEMs [14], etc.

The  remarkable  properties  of  multi-GEM
structures  are  very  attractive  for  the  numerous
applications: tracking detectors for high energy

In 

Such a broad variety of applications is based
on  various  physical  effects  taking  place  in
multi-GEM  structures. 
this  paper  we
describe  some  of  them  and  in  particular  the
high-pressure  operation  in  noble  gases,  which
has  a  fundamental  meaning  from  the  point  of
view  of  electron  avalanching  in  dense  noble
gases.  The  effects  of 
ion  feedback  and
avalanche  extension  from  the  GEM  hole  are
also discussed.

2. Physics of multi-GEM structures

A  typical  multi-GEM  detector  consists  of  a
cathode, a cascade of 3-4 GEM elements and a
printed-circuit-board  (PCB)  anode  mounted
inside the gas volume. The  GEM  is  made  of  a
50 m m thick Kapton foil, copper clad from both
sides and perforated by a matrix of micro-holes.
The hole pitch is 140 m m; the hole diameter is
typically  70‚ 80  m m  on  the  copper  side  and
40‚ 60  m m  on  the  Kapton  side.  The  drift  gap
(between the cathode and the 1st GEM), transfer
gaps  (between  the  GEMs)  and  induction  gap
(between  the  last  GEM  and  the  anode)  are
typically 3, 1‚ 2 and 1‚ 2 mm, correspondingly.
The  GEM  electrodes  are  biased  through  a
resistive high-voltage divider.

The physics of multi-GEM structures is rather
complex,  regarding  the  number  of  phenomena
affecting the detector performance. A particular
large  number  of  effects  is  observed  in  multi-
GEM  photomultipliers  operated  with  pure
noble  gases 
schematically
[3,23].  Fig.1 
illustrates  some  processes  that  might  occur  in
such a detector :

ion feedback from a GEM to the preceding
GEMs and to the photocathode, resulting in
the after-pulses and gain limitations due to
ion-induced electron emission [3,23];
ion feedback to the bottom GEM electrode,
resulting in charging-up of kapton surfaces
at  high  anode  currents  and  leading  to  gain
instabilities [3,23];
avalanche  confinement  in  the  GEM  holes,
resulting  in  the  avalanche  saturation  at
relatively moderate gains [3,23];
avalanche extension outside the GEM holes
at high gains, resulting in the limitation on
the minimum inter-GEM distance [3,23].
Other  interesting  physical  effects  relevant  to
the  multi-GEM  structure  performance  are  the
discharge  propagation  [11],  GEM  electron
transparency  [5,24],  high-pressure  operation  in
traditional  [25]  and  pure  noble  gas  mixtures
[9,10],  low-pressure  operation  [26],  ageing
[6,13],  electric  field  pattern  computation  [5],
etc. Some of these topics are considered in the
following sections.

3. High-pressure operation in noble gases

In 

High-pressure operation of GEM detectors in
pure  noble  gases  is  relevant  in  the  field  of
double-phase  cryogenic  particle  detectors  [27]
for  solar  neutrino  and  dark  matter  search
the  primary
such  detectors 
[17,18]. 
ionization  produced  in  liquid  He,  Ne  or  Xe  is
extracted into the gas phase where it is detected
using the GEM multiplier. Since the gas density
is  a  reciprocal  function  of  temperature,  at  a
given  pressure,  the  gas  detector  operation  at
cryogenic temperatures at atmospheric pressure
is  equivalent  to  that  at  high  pressures  at  room
temperature.  In  addition,  the  high-pressure
operation in pure He is attractive for He3-based
neutron detectors [22], X-ray imaging detectors
[28],  high-pressure
with  solid  convertors

The  experimental  results  on  the  triple-GEM
detector  operation  in  compressed  noble  gases
were  obtained  in  [9,10]:  Fig.2  shows  the

[25],  are  presented 

In  Fig.3 

shows 

In  contrast  to  molecular  gases,  the  discharge
voltages  in  practically  all  noble  gases  stop
increasing  when  exceeding  3  atm.  We  relate
this  to  a  specific  nature  of  the  discharge
mechanism  in  noble  gases:  the  discharges  are
presumably  generated  by  ion-induced  electron
emission due to the ion feedback from the  last
to preceding GEMs [3]. This is because the ion-
induced  electron  emission 
is  considerably
enhanced  in  noble  gases  compared  to  other
gases  [33].  On  the  other  hand,  the  operation
voltages  in  Ar,  Kr  and  Xe  increase  with
pressure,  reflecting  the  E/p  dependence  of  the
ionization  coefficient.  Therefore  the  maximum
gain  in  these  gases  drops  rapidly  for  pressures
exceeding 3 atm.

The operation in light noble gases is different
from that of heavy noble gases: their operation
voltages  grow  very  slowly  or  even  decrease
with pressure [9,10]. This may explain the large
gain  values  obtained  in  He  and  Ne  at  high
pressures, reaching 105, despite of the fact that
their  operation  voltages  are  by  a  factor  of  2-3
lower than those in Ar, Kr and Xe.

One can see that in He and Ne the ionization

that a new avalanche mechanism arises at high

in atomic collisions due to the association of an
atom with an excited atom into a molecular ion:

.  In  He,  this  reaction
goes  via  short-lived  excited  atomic  states,  the
lowest  energy  levels  of  which  are  3P  and  3D.
The  reaction  cross-section  is  rather  large,  of
about  10-15- 10-16  cm2.  Also, 
the  energy
threshold  for  the  molecular  ion  appearance  is
lower  than  that  of  the  atomic  ion,  by  about  1
eV, in all noble gases.

e

The hypothesis that the associative ionization
is responsible for the discrepancy in ionization
coefficients observed in He at pressures  below
1 atm, as well as for the E/p scaling violation in
a /p, was introduced in [35]. It is interesting that
according  to  theoretical  calculations  [37]  the
avalanche  development  in  liquid  He,  at  low
electric  fields,  would  also  be  defined  by  the
associative  ionization.  In  addition,  we  show
below  that  the  contribution  of  the  associative
ionization  might  provide  the  required  pressure
dependence.

4.  A  model  for  avalanche  development  in

noble gases

Let  us  consider  a  simplified  model  for  the
avalanche development including the following
basic processes [36]: impact ionization, atomic
excitation,  associative 
ionization  and  de-
excitation  due  to  photon  emission,  with  the

One can see that the agreement between high
and low pressure data in He and Ne is achieved
only  if  to  take  into  account  the  associative
ionization  contribution.  This  contribution  is
about  2/3  in  He  and  ½  in  Ne  at  atmospheric
pressure; it fully dominates at higher pressures,
but becomes negligible at pressures lower than
0.2  atm,  i.e.  just  in  the  region  where  the

presented  in  the  literature,  were  measured.  In
Ar,  Kr  and  Xe  the  associative  ionization  is
negligible at all pressures.

presented  elsewhere  [7].  Since  the  mechanism
of  ion  feedback  suppression  in  multi-GEM
structures  is  not  fully  understood,  we  consider
here  only  those  effects  that  might  have  some
apparent explanations: the influence of the gas
and pressure and the possible connection to the
effect  of  the  avalanche  extension  from  the
GEM holes.

Fig.6  shows  the  ion  feedback  fraction  (the
ratio  of  the  cathode-to-anode  currents)  as  a
function  of  the  gain  of  a  triple-GEM  detector,
in He at 1, 5 and 10 atm and in Ar/CF4 at 1 atm
[7].  Most  of  the  data  were  obtained  when  the
voltage  across  the  drift  gap  was  equal  to  that
applied  across  each  GEM,  i.e.  when  the  drift
field  was  proportional  to  electric  field  inside
the  GEM  hole.  One  data  set,  in  Ar/CF4,  is
obtained  at  a  constant  drift  field:  ED=0.5
kV/cm.

The  results  might  seem  to  be  surprising.
Indeed,  the  difference  in  operation  voltages
between  He  and  Ar/CF4  is  of  a  factor  of  2-2.5
and  the  difference  in  E/p  values  reaches  a
factor of 10 (see Figs.2,3).  Despite of this, the
ion  feedback  is  practically  independent  of  the
gas, pressures and E/p, for a given gain (fig.6).
The  conclusion  might  be  that  the  electron  and
ion  diffusion,  which  is  generally  a  function  of
the  pressure,  gas  and  reduced  electric  field,
does  not  affect  the  ion  feedback.  That  means

considerably enhanced. We suppose that this is
connected  to  the  effect  of  the  avalanche
extension  outside  the  GEM  holes  [3],  which
has  a  threshold  dependence  on  gain  [23].
Indeed, if it would be the case, the positive ions
produced  outside  the  hole  would  have  more
chances  to  be  terminated  at  the  bottom  GEM
electrode rather than to go through  the  hole.  It
is interesting that the critical gain, at which the
supposed avalanche extension takes place here,
is of the same order as that estimated earlier in
Ar  from  the  pulse-shape  analysis  [23]:  4· 104.
This  speaks 
the  avalanche
in  favour  of 
extension hypothesis.

6. Conclusions

The physics of multi-GEM structures is rather
complex; the performance of such structures is
characterized  by  a  large  number  of  physical
effects.  A  few  of  them,  namely  the  high-
pressure operation in noble gases, ion feedback
and  avalanche  extension,  were  considered  in
this work.

in 

In  order  to  describe  the  unusual  pressure
dependence of avalanche characteristics in light
noble gases, He and Ne, it is proposed that the
avalanche  mechanism 
these  gases,  at
pressures  exceeding  1  atm,  is  due  to  the
associative  ionization.  On  the  other  hand,  the
data in Ar, Kr and Xe are described well by the
electron  impact  ionization  mechanism.  The
question  why  such  a  difference  exists  between
light  and  noble  gases  should  be  addressed  to
more

elaborated 
consequence  of 
the  proposed  avalanche
mechanism  is  that  the  operation  voltages  in
multi-GEM  detectors  are  much  lower  than
expected,  allowing  for  high  gain  operation  in
dense  He  and  Ne.  This  property  is  very
attractive  for  numerous  applications  in  high
energy  physics,  astroparticle  detection,  nuclear
physics and medical imaging.

The  detailed  mechanism  of  ion  feedback
suppression in multi-GEM structures is not yet

well  understood.  In  particular,  the  inverse
power  dependence  of  ion  feedback  fraction  on
gain,  observed 
in  experiment,  should  be
explained  in  the  future.  The  independence  of
the  pressure  and  the  gas  may  indicate  that  the
ion feedback is governed mainly by geometrical
factors  inside  the  GEM  hole,  such  as  the  hole
diameter  and  shape,  the  electric  field  pattern
and  the  avalanche  shape.  In  particular,  the
change  of  the  avalanche  shape  due  to  its
possible extension outside the GEM hole might

Further  studies  of  these  and  other  effects  in
multi-GEM  structures,  e.g.  operation  in  noble
gases  at  cryogenic  temperatures,  in  a  gas  and
liquid  phase,  light  emission  in  an  avalanche,
double-phase detectors, etc., are in course.

Fig.2  Maximum  gain  of  a  triple-GEM  detector  as  a
function of pressure in He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe [9,10].

 
Fig.4  Comparison  of  ionization  coefficients  at  high  (a H  ,
points) and low (a L , curves) pressures, in He, Ne and Ar.
The  a H  values  were  obtained  using  the  triple-GEM
detector gain at appropriate electric field inside the  GEM
hole,  EGEM  .  The  a L  values  were  compiled  from  the
literature.

Fig.3  Maximum  operation  voltage  that  can  be  applied
across each GEM in a triple-GEM detector as a function of
pressure,  in  He,  Ne,  Ar,  Kr  and  Xe  [9,10].  The  data
obtained  in  Ar/CO2  and  CH4  in  a  single-GEM  detector
[25] are presented for comparison.

 
Fig.5  Fit  of  the  quantity  a H  /p/(1+Cp)  obtained  from  the
experimental data at high pressures (points) to the reduced
ionization coefficients at low pressures,  a L /p, taken from
the  literature  (curves).  The  fitting  parameter  C  describes
the  contribution  of  the  associative  ionization  in  He,  Ne
and Ar.

Fig.6 Ion feedback fraction as a function of the gain  of  a
triple-GEM  detector,  in  He  at  1,  5  and  10  atm  and  in
Ar/CF4 at 1 atm [7]. Two data sets are shown: with a drift
field  proportional  to  electric  field  inside  the  GEM  hole
(D VD=D VGEM)  and  with  a  constant  drift  field  (ED=0.5
kV/cm).

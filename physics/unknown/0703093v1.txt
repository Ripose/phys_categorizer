Abstract 

High temperature impact melt breccias from the Rochechouart (France) meteorite crater 

record  a  magnetization  component  with  antipodal,  normal  and  reverse  polarities.  The 

corresponding paleomagnetic pole for this component lies between the 220 Ma and 210 

Ma reference poles on the Eurasian apparent polar wander path, consistent with the 214±8 

Ma 40Ar/39Ar age of the crater. Late Triassic tectonic reconstructions of the Eurasian and 

North American plates place this pole within 95% confidence limits of the paleomagnetic 

pole  from  the  Manicouagan  (Canada)  meteorite  impact  crater,  which  is  dated  at  214±1 

Ma.  Together,  these  observations  reinforce  the  hypothesis  of  a  Late  Triassic,  multiple 

meteorite impact event on Earth. 

1. Introduction 

The  speed  and  energy  associated  with  meteorite  impacts  make  them  exceptional 

events  on  Earth.  Although  their  potential  to  wipe  out  large  populations  of  species  is 

widely reported, details surrounding the cratering process are more ambiguous. One hotly 

debated  topic  surrounds  five  Late  Triassic,  terrestrial  craters  whose  age  distribution  led 

Spray  et  al.  [1998]  to  propose  that  they  formed  due  to  the  fragmentation  of  a  single

meteorite, like that observed on Jupiter in 1994 [Orton et al., 1995]. Evidence supporting 

the  Spray  et  al.  [1998]  hypothesis  for  a  fragmented,  or  Shoemaker-Levy  9-type,  impact 

relied  mostly  on  radiometric  dating  of  the  Manicouagan  (Canada)  and  Rochechouart 

(France)  craters  at  214±1  Ma  (U-Pb  [Hodych  and  Dunning,  1992])  and  214±8  Ma 

(40Ar/39Ar [Kelley and Spray, 1997]), respectively. Late Triassic ages for the other three 

craters were loosely constrained by biostratigraphy. Controversy arose when Kent [1998] 

pointed  out  that  the  Manicouagan  melt  rocks  recorded  only  normal  magnetic  polarities 

[Larochelle  and  Currie,  1967;  Robertson,  1967],  while  those  of  Rochechouart  had  only 

reverse polarities [Pohl and Soffel, 1971]. The polarity differences thus put into question 

whether  the  two  craters  were  truly  coeval,  as  Kent  [1998]  reasoned  that  at  least  a  few 

thousand  years,  the  time  needed  for  the  Earth’s  field  to  reverse,  separated  the  two 

impacts. Spray [1998] countered that differences in thermal mass between the two craters, 

owing to the much larger size of Manicouagan (100 km in diameter with a >230 m-thick 

melt sheet) than Rochechouart (25 km in diameter with a 12 m-thick impact melt breccia), 

would lead to different cooling rates, thus offsetting the time when the magnetic minerals 

in the rocks at the two craters cooled through their Curie points. Thus, the impact could 

have  occurred  during  a  reversed  magnetic  polarity  that  was  recorded  by  the  relatively 

fast-cooling  suevites  at  Rochechouart;  by  the  time  the  rocks  cooled  below  ~600°C  at 

Manicouagan, the Earth’s field was in a normal polarity state. 

In order to further test the Late Triassic, multiple impact event hypothesis, we re-

investigated the paleomagnetism of the Rochechouart crater (Fig. 1a). We filled gaps in 

the  previous  study  of  Pohl  and  Soffel  [1971]  by  sampling  basement  rocks  and  impact 

breccias  (suevites)  having  experienced  the  highest  degrees  of  melting.  We  find  that  the 

Rochechouart suevites record dual magnetic polarities and that the virtual paleomagnetic

poles (VGPs) from Rochechouart are indistinguishable with those from Manicouagan in a 

Late Triassic reference frame.  

2. Paleomagnetic results 

We  sampled  52  cores  at  12  sites  using  a  gas-powered  drill.  The  cores  were 

oriented  with  magnetic  and  sun  compasses,  the  latter  to  correct  for  local  declination 

anomalies.  Four  sites  were  drilled  in  impact  melt  breccias,  while  eight  sites  come  from 

basement  rocks  of  variable  lithologies  lying  within  a  radius  of  16  km  from  the  crater’s 

estimated  center  at  45.825°N,  0.785°E,  which  lies  near  the  town  of  Rochechouart 

[Lambert,  1977a  and  1977b]  (Fig.  1a;  Table  1).  Samples  cut  from  the  cores  underwent 

stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetization up to 150 mT or thermal demagnetization 

up to 700°C with an average of 14 demagnetization steps. Magnetization components and 

mean directions were determined using principal component analysis [Kirschvink, 1980] 

and Fisher [1953] statistics, respectively. 

After  the  first  few  demagnetization  steps,  the  impact  breccias  with  the  highest 

degrees of melting, or so-called Babaudus-type suevites from sites 6 and 8, reveal stable 

demagnetization  trajectories  that  decay  univectorially  toward  the  origin  on  orthogonal 

demagnetization  plots  (Figs.  1b  to  1d).  AF  demagnetization  removes  only  ~50%  of  the 

original remanence with total unblocking occurring at temperatures of 680°C, indicative 

of  hematite  as  the  carrier  of  the  magnetic  remanence.  Thermomagnetic  experiments  on 

the  same  rocks  reveal  a  Hopkinson  peak  and  an  inflection  at  580°C,  signaling  the 

additional  presence  of  single  domain  magnetite.  All  samples  from  Site  8  have  reversed 

polarity  magnetizations  (Fig.  1b),  whereas  those  from  Site  6  possess  normal  polarity 

magnetization directions (Fig. 1c). These normal polarity samples have demagnetization 

characteristics  identical  to  samples  with  reverse  polarities,  and  we  find  no  evidence 

 

3

(antipodal  magnetization  components  in  a  single  sample,  etc.)  to  support  a  self-reversal 

mechanism  to  explain  the  polarity  differences.  Thermal  demagnetization  of  two  of  the 

five samples from the Babaudus-type suevites at Site 7, located ca. 50 m from Site 6, have 

a  component  with  easterly  declinations  and  shallow  inclinations  that  decays  linearly 

toward  the  origin.  Three  samples  subjected  to  AF  demagnetization  have  two  magnetic 

components:  one  resembling  the  two  others  from  Site  7  at  fields  below  22  mT,  and 

another isolated above 22 mT, with the same normal polarity direction observed in Site 6 

(Fig. 1d). One difference between sites 6 and 7 is that the natural remanent magnetization 

(NRM)/bulk susceptibility is twice as low for the former (171±43 Am-1X-1, N=5) than for 

the  latter  (379±48  Am-1X-1,  N=4).  These  values,  combined  with  the  fact  that  AF 

demagnetization  more  efficiently  removes  isothermal  remanent  magnetizations  [Coe  et 

al.,  2004],  suggest  that  Site  7  was  struck  by  lightning.  Thus,  we  combined  the  high 

coercivity component of the three samples from Site 7 with those from Site 6 to calculate 

an overall mean direction (Table 1). 

Impact breccias at the Montoume quarry (Site 5) contain decameter-size clasts of 

basement material (gneiss), so we drilled six samples in the melted matrix and six in the 

clasts  in  order  to  apply  a  conglomerate  test.  The  demagnetization  characteristics  and 

magnetic  mineralogies  of  the  matrix  and  clasts  are  similar  to  one  another  and  resemble 

those of the Babaudus-type suevites (Figs. 1e and 1f). Magnetization directions from the 

matrix  and  clasts  from  Montoume  are  indistinguishable  at  95%  confidence  limits 

(negative  conglomerate  test  [McFadden  and  Lowes,  1981]),  suggesting  that  the  clasts 

were heated above the hematite Curie temperature (680°C). 

The magnetization directions of the melt rocks are well clustered both within sites 

and  among  the  various  sites  (Fig.  2a),  with  the  normal  and  reversed  polarity  directions 

 

4

being  statistically  antipodal  within  95%  confidence  limits  (Class  B  [McFadden  and 

McElhinny,  1990]).  We  interpret  these  directions  as  recording  a  magnetic  field  reversal 

during  cooling  (e.g.,  a  primary,  thermal  remanent  magnetization).  However,  Lambert 

[1974 and 1977b] mapped the Rochechouart impact melt sheet as covering an area of 80 

km² with a medium thickness of 12 m. He estimated that the original thickness was 100 m 

over 280 km², which corresponds to a characteristic cooling time of ~400 years [Onorato 

et al., 1978]. Although this seems too rapid to have recorded a field reversal (reversals are 

thought  to  last  at  least  a  few  thousand  years,  e.g.,  Quidelleur  et  al.  [2003];  Clement 

[2004]), the thickness and cooling time are likely underestimated. 

The  basement  rocks  display  diverse  demagnetization  behavior.  At 

the 

Champagnac quarry (Sites 1 and 2), granodiorite, leucogranite and pseudotachylite were 

drilled  in  two  places  separated  by  a  few  hundred  meters.  The  basement  rocks  at 

Champagnac lie ~10 m below the impact breccias and contain ample evidence of shock, 

including the presence of planar deformation features [Kraut and French, 1971; Lambert, 

1974 and 1977b; Reimold et al., 1984; Bishoff and Oskierski, 1987]. Demagnetization of 

one  sample  yielded  highly  erratic  directions.  After  removing  a  recent  field  direction, 

magnetization  directions  of  the  sole  pseudotachylite  sample  are  noisy  but  mostly  north 

and  upward  directed  above  10  mT.  Except  for  the  pseudotachylite  sample  and  the  one 

incoherent  sample,  the  rest  display  relatively  coherent  magnetization  directions  with 

southwest-oriented  declinations  and  shallow-upward  inclinations  that  are  unblocked  by 

350°C  (Fig.  1g).  The  directions  isolated  from  sites  1  and  2  are  comparable,  so  we 

combined  them  when  calculating  a  site-mean  direction  (Table  1,  Fig.  2a).  A  rock 

magnetic  investigation  of  the  Site  1&2  samples  identifies  a  magnetic  mineral 

characteristic of magnetite with a Hopkinson peak and a Curie temperature around 570°C, 

 

5

yet no evidence for a phase with a Curie temperature around 350°C, such as pyrrhotite. 

Moreover, hysteresis loops measured at 200°C before and after heating to 400°C [Henry 

et al., 2005] are identical, confirming the absence of a magnetic phase with a Curie point 

between 200°C and 400°C. Our preferred explanation is that the Champagnac basement 

was heated to 350°C during impact, which remagnetized the magnetite grains capable of 

acquiring remanences up to 350°C. This would explain why nearly all of the remanence 

unblocks  in  a  very  narrow  temperature  range  around  350°C,  despite  the  absence  of  a 

magnetic  mineral  with  this  characteristic  Curie  point.  If  true,  this  would  constrain  the 

maximum  temperature  experienced  by  these  basement  rocks.  Although  the  Site  1&2 

mean direction has shallower inclinations than the Babaudus-type suevites, they lie close 

to the direction isolated in other suevite types as will be discussed below. 

Gneiss,  schist  and  microgranite  samples  from  the  Champonger  quarry  (Site  3) 

vary  markedly  from  sample  to  sample.  Some  have  erratic  directions  from  one 

demagnetization  step  to  the  next.  Others  yield  more  coherent  magnetization  directions 

that  fall  near  the  expected  axial  dipole  field  direction  (inclination  =  64°),  which  lies 

within  a  few  degrees  of  the  present-day  Earth’s  field  direction.  A  few  have  noisy 

remanences  that  are  often  southwest  and  up  directed  but  without  linear  trajectories  that 

can be interpreted with confidence. Serpentinites from the Merlis quarry (Site 4) possess 

stable magnetizations, carried mostly by Fe-pure magnetite (Curie temperature of 580°C), 

with  well-grouped  magnetization  directions  (Figs.  1h  and  2a,  Table  1).  Gneiss  sampled 

near Fonceverane (Site 9), located a few 100 meters from the Site 8 suevites, has unstable 

magnetizations.  Thermal  and  AF  demagnetization  of  the  granite  collected  along  road 

D160  (Site  10)  isolate  north  and  down  magnetization  directions  similar  to  the  present 

Earth’s magnetic field direction, which we interpret as a recent remagnetization. Granite 

 

6

from  the  Chabanais  quarry  (Site  11)  has  very  stable  magnetizations  carried  mainly  by 

magnetite  whose  directions  are  reasonably  well  clustered  (Figs.  1i  and  2a,  Table  1). 

Finally, granite sampled along Highway N141 (Site 12), northeast of the crater, possesses 

unstable magnetizations with weak intensities (<5x10-5 A/m). 

3. Interpretation and Discussion 

 

For the impact breccias at Rochechouart, the overall mean direction based on 25 

samples (20 cores) is declination (D)= 36.0°, inclination (I)= 43.0°, the best estimate of 

the precision parameter (k)= 107.3, and the radius that the mean direction lies within 95% 

confidence (α95)= 2.8°. The overall mean, based on the three site-mean directions (sites 5, 

6&7 and 8), is D= 35.6°, I= 42.7° (k= 806.9, α95= 4.3°), whose pole lies at latitude (λ)= 

54.6°N, longitude (φ)= 114.9°E (A95= 5.2°). The previous paleomagnetic study  by Pohl 

and Soffel [1971] at Rochechouart calculated a mean direction based on 130 samples (33 

cores)  of  D=  46.4°,  I=  34.8°  (k=  310,  α95=  4°),  which  is  different  at  95%  confidence 

limits  from  the  direction  we  obtained.  Figure  2b  shows  the  virtual  geomagnetic  poles 

(VGPs) of their sites and ours, where it appears that the VGPs lie along a swath, with the 

sites  comprising  Babaudus-type  suevites  lying  close  to  the  Late  Triassic  paleomagnetic 

poles from the Eurasian apparent polar wander path (APWP). 

What can account for the differences between the impact breccia VGPs? Sampling 

techniques were virtually the same in both studies, and although Pohl and Soffel [1971] 

applied a blanket correction of -6° to account for the local declination anomaly, which is 

perhaps a few degrees too westerly for the late 1960s at Rochechouart [Alexandrescu et 

al.,  1999],  subtracting  a  few  degrees  cannot  account  for  the  discrepancy  between  their 

study  and  ours.  The  overall  mean  of  Pohl  and  Soffel  [1971]  was  based  only  on  NRM 

 

7

directions  and  not  on  principal  component  analyses  derived 

from  stepwise 

demagnetization.  However,  Pohl  and  Soffel  [1971]  performed  magnetic  viscosity  tests 

and  they  compared  the  mean  direction  based  on  blanket  AF  demagnetization  with  the 

NRM directions, finding no compelling reason to reject the NRM directions. We confirm 

their analysis in that the mean direction based on the NRMs from our study (D= 35.4°, I= 

43.9°, N= 22, k= 46.7, α95= 4.6°, excluding Site 7) is virtually identical to the one based 

on principal component analysis. 

So  either  a  systematic  bias  exists  between  the  two  laboratories  or  another 

explanation  must  be  sought.  One  possibility  could  lie  in  secular  variation.  Indeed,  three 

types  of  impact  breccias,  or  so-called  suevites,  have  been  identified  at  Rochechouart 

based on their degrees of melting, going from Chassenon to Montoume to Babaudus types 

with increasing degrees of melting, respectively [Lambert, 1974 and 1977b; Chèvremont 

et al., 1996]. Pohl and Soffel [1971] primarily sampled the Chassenon to Montoume type 

suevites, while we collected Montoume and Babaudus types. If the degree of melting is 

related  to  cooling  time,  then  it  is  possible  that  the  Rochechouart  VGPs  track  secular 

variation  of  the  Late  Triassic  geomagnetic  field.  The  suevites  that  cooled  the  slowest 

would  probably  average secular variation, which would explain why the Babaudus type 

suevites  recorded  a  reversal.  It  would  also  explain  why  they  lie  closest  to  the  poles 

defining the Eurasian apparent polar wander path (APWP), which is thought to represent 

the time-averaged field. Of note is that the VGPs of sites 5 to 8 lie between the 210 and 

220 Ma reference poles (Figure 2b), which coincides well with the 40Ar/39Ar age of 214±8 

Ma for the impact [Kelley and Spray, 1997]. Moreover, if one corrected the 212 Ma St. 

Audrie’s Bay (United Kingdom) Late Triassic pole for inclination shallowing [Kent and 

 

8

Tauxe, 2005], the corrected pole lies within 95% confidence limits of our Rochechouart 

pole. Thus, we think the differences between the virtual paleomagnetic poles of Pohl and 

Soffel  [1971]  and  our  own  is  that  the  former  recorded  instantaneous  fields  whereas  the 

latter are representative of a time-averaged field. 

Magnetic data from the basement rocks may shed light on the thermal effects of 

the  impact  at  Rochechouart.  That  all  sites  yielding  stable  magnetic  remanences  have 

reversed  polarities  could  suggest  that  they  were  thermally  remagnetized  during  the 

impact. Alternatively, because the basement rocks have radiometric ages ranging from ca. 

360 to 240 Ma [Lambert, 1974; Reimold and Oskierski, 1987a and 1987b; Chèvremont et 

al., 1996], some lie within the Kiaman reversed polarity superchron that lasted from ~315 

to  260  Ma  [Opdyke  and  Channell,  1996].  Figure  2b  shows  a  polar  projection  of  the 

Rochechouart VGPs from all lithologies. VGPs of Sites 1&2 and 11 lie on the far side of 

the VGP swath defined by the suevites and, as discussed above, the closest VGP to the 

suevites  (Site  1&2)  is  particularly  noteworthy  because  it  comes  from  the  Champagnac 

quarry  where  pseudotachylites  and  planar  deformation  features  in  quartz  have  been 

described  [Kraut  and  French,  1971;  Lambert,  1974  and  1977b;  Reimold  et  al.,  1984; 

Bishoff  and  Oskierski,  1987].  Here,  there  is  evidence  that  these  rocks  were  heated  to 

350°C  (Fig.  1g).  Using  a  similar  logic,  one  could  suggest  that  the  granites  from  the 

Chabanais  quarry  (Site  11)  were  heated  above  magnetite  Curie  temperatures.  However, 

assuming that the Chabanais granite has not been tilted, its magnetic remanence is likely 

primary (pre-impact) because the paleolatitude coincides with that expected from the ca. 

260 Ma Eurasian APWP [Van der Voo, 1993; Torsvik et al., 2001], thus potentially being 

Kiaman  in  age.  Further,  there  is  no  evidence  for  shock  in  the  Chabanais  granite,  which 

lies ~9 km from the crater’s center, like there is at the Champagnac quarry, which lies ~6 

 

9

km  from  the  crater’s  center  and  has  suevites  directly  covering  the  basement  rocks. 

Finally, the serpentinite pole from the Merlis quarry (Site 4) lies near the 240 Ma pole on 

the Eurasian APWP [Van der Voo, 1993; Torsvik et al., 2001], far from the population of 

suevites. Magnetic remanences from this site (>10 km from the crater’s center) are most 

likely pre-impact. 

A  final  point  to  address  is  whether  tilting  during  post-impact  rebound  of  the 

Rochechouart  crater  reoriented  the  magnetic  directions  of  the  suevites  and  basement 

rocks. Observations of most complex craters show that pre-impact rocks dip away from 

the  crater’s  center  with  strikes  that  are  tangential  to  the  radius  [Grieve  and  Pilkington, 

1996;  Mazur  et  al.,  2000;  Grieve  and  Therriault,  2004].  Under  this  scenario,  localities 

with  southwest  and  up  directions  lying  south  of  the  crater  that  are  subsequently  tilted 

should have lower than average inclinations, while those to the north should have higher 

than  average  inclinations.  This  is  not  observed  in  the  data  (Table  1),  which  leads  us  to 

conclude that the magnetite remanences in the suevites were not significantly reoriented 

by post-impact rebound. The region has been tectonically quiescent since the impact. 

The  discovery  of  normal  polarities  in  the  Rochechouart  suevites  leads  us  to  re-

examine the multiple impact hypothesis of Spray et al. [1998]. If the suevites sampled in 

this study indeed averaged secular variation and have not been reoriented since cooling, 

we  can  then  compare  the  overall  mean  pole  from  Rochechouart  with  that  from 

Manicouagan  in  a  Late  Triassic  reference  frame.  Two  independent  studies  reported 

paleomagnetic data from Manicouagan. Larochelle and Currie [1967] published five site-

mean  VGPs  from  44  cores  based  on  a  blanket  demagnetization  step  at  20  mT  while 

Robertson  [1967]  published  six  site-mean  VGPs  from  33  cores  based  on  a  blanket 

demagnetization  step  at  35  mT.  We  averaged  the  11  site-means  to  calculate  an  overall 

 

10

mean  pole  of  λ=  58.9°N,  φ=  90.3°E  (A95=  5.8°)  for  the  Manicouagan  crater.  Figure  3a 

shows a paleogeographic reconstruction of Eurasia and North America at 210 Ma using 

the  parameters  from  Van  der  Voo  [1993]  and  Besse  and  Courtillot  [2002].  In  this 

reference frame, the Rochechouart and Manicouagan poles are indistinguishable at 95% 

confidence  limits.  Figure  3b  shows  an  Euler  rotation  at  210  Ma  of  Eurasia  relative  to  a 

fixed  North  America  following  Torsvik  et  al.  [2001].  In  this  reference  frame,  the 

Rochechouart  and  Manicouagan  poles  are  again  indistinguishable  at  95%  confidence 

limits.  This  finding,  together  with  the  dual  magnetic  polarities  now  recognized  at 

Rochechouart, puts the bulk of the evidence in favor of the Spray et al. [1998] hypothesis 

for a coeval Late Triassic impact event on Earth.

rocks. 

Abbreviations/notations  are:  Gran.,  granodiorite; 

leuco., 

leucogranite;  pseudo., 

pseudotachylite; n, number of samples considered in the site mean direction; N, number 

of  samples  demagnetized;  C,  number  of  cores  sampled;  Dec  -  Inc,  declination  - 

inclination  of  the  site-mean  direction;  k,  the  best  estimate  of  the  precision  parameter, 
which is a measure of the dispersion of a population of directions; α95, the radius that the 

mean direction lies within 95% confidence; Plat - Plong, latitude - longitude of the virtual 

geomagnetic pole (VGP) in °N and °E; dp - dm, the minor and major axes of the ellipsoid 

containing  the  mean  direction  within  95%  confidence  limits;  Slat  -  Slong,  latitude  - 

longitude of the sampling site in °N and °E. 

Figure  1.  a)  Simplified  geologic  map  of  the  Rochechouart  crater,  France;  the  dashed 

circle represents the approximate limit of the crater [after Chèvremont et al., 1996]. b-i) 

Zijderveld  diagrams  and  normalized  moments  of  typical  impact  melt  breccias  and 

basement rocks from the Rochechouart meteorite crater. 

 
Figure  2.  a)  Stereonet  plot  of  the  individual  sample  and  site-mean  (stars  with  α95 

confidence  ellipses)  directions.  The  grey  star  represents  the  international  geomagnetic 

reference  field  and  the  grey  diamond  represents  the  present-day  geocentric  axial  dipole 

direction at Rochechouart. b) Polar projection of the site-mean virtual geomagnetic poles 

(VGPs) from Rochechouart (locality represented by dark star with R) and Manicouagan 

(locality represented by grey star with M and VGP by a grey plus; data from Larochelle 

16

and  Currie  [1967]  and  Robertson  [1967]).  All  VGPs  are  projected  in  the  northern 

hemisphere. In light grey is the Eurasian apparent polar wander path (APWP) from Van 

der Voo [1993] and Besse and Courtillot [2002], in dark grey is the Eurasian APWP from 

Torsvik  et  al.  [2001]—numbers  next  to  the  poles  are  time-window  ages  in  millions  of 

years. The four VGPs in light grey are from Pohl and Soffel [1971]. The melting degree 

of  the  suevites  increases  from  the  Chassenon-type  (square),  to  the  Montoume-type 

(triangle) and finally to the Babaudus-type (circle) [Lambert, 1974; 1977b; Chèvremont et 

al.,  1996].  The  trajectory  of  these  VGPs  possibly  record  geomagnetic  secular  variation 

~214 million years ago during progressive cooling of the impact melt breccias. 

Figure 3. a) Paleogeographic reconstruction at 210 Ma using the parameters from Besse 

and Courtillot [2002] and Van der Voo [1993]. The Eurasian APWP is in light grey and 

the North American APWP is in dark grey— numbers next to the poles are time-window 

ages in millions of years. The overall mean pole from Rochechouart (data from this study; 

locality represented by dark star with R) and Manicouagan (locality represented by grey 

star  with  M)  are  indistinguishable  at  95%  confidence  limits  (Manicouagan  data  from 

Larochelle and Currie [1967] and Robertson [1967]). b) Paleogeographic reconstruction 

at 210 Ma in a North American-fixed reference frame using the parameters from Torsvik 

et al. [2001]. In grey is the combined North American and European APWP [Torsvik et 

al., 2001].

Abstract
—A nonrelativistic electron beam with a virtual cathode situated in the diode gap with a decelerating
ﬁeld is experimentally and theoretically studied. A 1D model of the electron beam in the presence of a decel-
erating  ﬁeld  is  constructed.  Nonlinear  nonstationary  processes  in  this  system  are  investigated  by  means  of
numerical analysis of the model. The processes are described and interpreted with regard to formation and inter-
action of structures in the electron ﬂow. The theoretical results are qualitatively conﬁrmed by the experimental
data showing that the system under study can be considered as a promising controlled source of chaotic oscil-
lations in the microwave range.

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of the complicated nonlinear dynamics
and physical processes in high-intensity electron beams
with a virtual cathode (VC) is an extremely important
and topical problem. The signiﬁcance of this problem
has  been  indicated  in  a  substantial  number  of  related
works (see, for example, [1–10]). This study is impor-
tant  for  the  fundamental  investigation  processes  gov-
erning  formation  of  the  chaotic  dynamics  and  struc-
tures in the beam–plasma systems [5, 6, 8, 9, 11–13],
for the applied analysis related to the development and
optimization  of  the VC-based  high-power  microwave
oscillators (vircators) [4, 5, 8, 14], for acceleration of
charged particles with an oscillating VC [15, 16], and
for creation of the sources of broadband noiselike radi-
ation with different power levels [10, 17].

Note that the experimental study and realization of
the VC-based oscillators is a very complicated problem
involving application of high-intensity relativistic elec-
tron beams with currents higher than the limiting vac-
uum  current  (supercritical  current)  [18].  In  this  case,
one cannot perform a detailed study of the characteris-
tics of generation of vircator systems and physical pro-
cesses in the electron beam with a VC. One of the pos-
sible  methods  for  easing  the  experimental  conditions
for generation of microwave oscillations with the help
of a VC involves application of systems with an addi-
tional deceleration of electrons in which a nonstation-
ary oscillating VC is formed owing to a strong deceler-

1
ation of the beam [10, 17, 21].
 Such a system can be
characterized by formation of a VC and generation of a
chaotic broadband signal at low currents and densities
of the electron beam. Hence, it is of interest to perform
an in-depth experimental study of physical processes in
a  nonrelativistic  beam  with  a  VC  via  conventional
approaches of the physical experimentation of vacuum
nonrelativistic microwave electronics [22].

In  this  case,  it  is  expedient  to  study  nonstationary
nonlinear processes in a nonrelativistic electron beam
with  a  VC  formed  in  the  presence  of  a  decelerating
ﬁeld. A plane diode gap transmitting an electron ﬂux in
the case when a decelerating voltage is applied to the
second  (output)  grid  can  be  considered  as  the  base
model. Such a model of the plane diode gap is one of
the base models that are widely used for the theoretical
and  numerical  analysis  of  processes  in  the  ﬂows  of
charged particles with a VC formed in the equipotential
space (in the absence of an additional deceleration) [9,
13, 23–25].

The purpose of this study is to numerically investi-
gate  nonstationary  nonlinear  processes,  including  the
dynamic  chaos  and  the  formation  and  interaction  of
coherent  structures  in  a  nonrelativistic  electron  beam
with a VC in the plane diode gap with a decelerating

ﬁeld, on the basis of the method of large particles. The
theoretical results on the chaotic VC oscillations in the
presence of a decelerating ﬁeld are veriﬁed on a spe-
cially designed prototype in which a nonstationary VC
is formed in a nonrelativistic electron beam in the diode
gap with a decelerating potential. Note that, in the case
of deceleration of an electron ﬂux, such systems with a
VC can serve as the sources of a noiselike broadband
medium-power chaotic microwave signal [10]. There-
fore, the theoretical and experimental analysis of such
systems is of great practical importance.

1.  MODEL AND  SCHEME
FOR  THE  NUMERICAL  SIMULATION

To study the electron ﬂux with a VC formed in the
presence of a decelerating ﬁeld, we consider a model of
a  plane  diode  gap  in  which  a  nonrelativistic  electron
beam  is  injected  through  the  ﬁrst  (input)  grid.  The
decelerating ﬁeld is generated owing to the presence of
a decelerating voltage at the second (output) grid of the
diode gap.

In the absence of deceleration, the electron ﬂow is
completely  transmitted  by  the  diode  gap  (stationary
transmission of the beam in the absence of a VC). How-
ever,  a  nonstationary  oscillating  VC  may  emerge  in
such a system in the presence of a decelerating ﬁeld in
a certain range of the potential of the second grid. The
VC  oscillations  can  be  used  for  generation  of  micro-
wave  radiation.  In  contrast  to  conventional  vircators,
which employ the relativistic beams and whose pulse
power ranges from several tens to several hundreds of
megawatts [13], these oscillations are characterized by
a signiﬁcantly lower power. (In [17], the integral con-
tinuous-wave power of the oscillations in a nonrelativ-
istic beam with a VC formed in the presence of a decel-
erating  ﬁeld  is  a  few  watts  for  the  centimeter  wave
range.)

Consider the scheme for the numerical simulation of
nonlinear  nonstationary  processes  in  a  nonrelativistic
electron ﬂux that is used in this study. We assume the
1D motion of the electron beam. In the case of planar
conﬁguration of the diode gap, the electron ﬂux repre-
sents a set of large particles (charged sheets) injected at
equal  time  intervals  with  a  constant  velocity  into  the

The main parameters of the numerical scheme (such

n0 of particles per cell in the unperturbed state) are Nm =
800 and n0 = 24. These values correspond to a number
of particles in the calculation space in the unperturbed
state of N = 19 200. The parameters of the numerical
scheme are chosen so as to reach the desired accuracy
and ensure adequacy of the results for the analysis of
complicated  nonlinear  processes,  including  the  deter-
ministic  chaos  in  the  electron–plasma  system  under
study [26, 27]. The equations are solved with the use of
the  step-over  scheme  [26]  with  the  second  order  of
accuracy. The Poisson equations are integrated via the
error-vector propagation method [28].

2. NONLINEAR VIRTUAL-CATHODE DYNAMICS 
DURING A VARIATION
IN  THE  CONTROL  PARAMETERS

Consider the results of numerical simulation of the
nonlinear dynamics for an electron ﬂux with a VC in
the presence of a decelerating ﬁeld.

Figure 1 demonstrates characteristic regimes of the
electron-ﬂux oscillations in the diode gap in the plane
of such parameters as Pierce parameter α and the decel-
erating potential difference between the grids, ∆ϕ. Fig-
ure  2  shows  power  spectra  P( f )  and  phase  portraits
(plotted  by  means  of  the  delay  method  [29])  for  the
oscillations of the center of mass, xcm(t), of the electron
beam in the diode gap for the Pierce parameter α = 0.9
and various decelerating potential differences ∆ϕ. The
center-of-mass  coordinate  is  determined  as  xcm  =

particle  and  N  is  the  total  number  of  particles  in  the
interaction  space.  The  center-of-mass  oscillations  are
chosen  as  a  parameter  characterizing  the  behavior  of
the  system  in  accordance  with  [11].  Note  that  this
choice is valid because, in the case of formation of a
VC,  the  maximum  space  charge  of  the  beam  corre-
sponds to the VC region and the center-of-mass oscilla-
tions sufﬁciently accurately describe the features of the
VC dynamics.

beam are absent. Line 1 in the map of the regimes cor-
responds to the critical values of the control parameters
(Pierce  parameter  α  and  potential  difference  ∆ϕ
cr).
Above these values, the system exhibits instability and
a  nonstationary  VC  that  oscillates  in  time  and  space
emerges  in  the  beam.  In  the  absence  of  deceleration
(∆ϕ = 0), the critical value of the Pierce parameter cor-
responding to formation of a nonstationary VC is α
cr =
4/3 [13]. This critical value is indicated with arrow on
the  abscissa  axis  in  Fig.  1. When  potential  difference
∆ϕ that leads to deceleration of electrons increases, the
boundary  of  the  region  in  which  a  nonstationary VC
emerges shifts toward smaller values of Pierce parame-
ter α. Thus, an increase in the decelerating potential at
the  second  grid  of  the  diode  leads  to  generation  of
microwave  oscillations  with  the  help  of  a  VC  at  the
beam currents that are lower than the currents ﬂowing
in a system without deceleration.

Line 2 in Fig. 1 corresponds to the values of control
parameters at which oscillations in the system are sup-
pressed and a stationary VC (from which all the elec-
trons injected into the diode gap are reﬂected) emerges
in the beam. This regime (Fig. 1, region S) is observed
at a relatively strong deceleration and can be described
analytically in the framework of the stationary theory of
an electron ﬂux with the supercritical current (see, for
example, [30]).

In the region between lines 1 and 2, as the deceler-
ating  potential  increases,  the  system  sequentially
exhibits oscillation regimes Pn and C in the beam with
a VC. Regimes Pn are regular VC oscillations that differ
from each other by the phase portrait and the spectral

structure. In particular, for low decelerating potentials
at the second grid, the system exhibits oscillations P1
and P2. Figures 2a and 2b show the corresponding char-
acteristics  of  the  center-of-mass  oscillations  for  these

regimes with low deceleration of the electron beam. It
is  seen  that,  in  this  case,  the  power  spectra  represent
discrete  sets  of  frequencies  against  a  relatively  low
noise pedestal. Note that the spectra corresponding to

P

regimes P1 and P2 substantially differ from each other.
In  regime  P1  (Fig.  2b),  the  fundamental  frequency  is
shifted  toward  lower  frequencies  than  in  regime  P2
(Fig. 2a). Note two low-frequency spectral components
against a noise pedestal in regime P1. The phase por-
traits of these regimes differ by the shape and height of
the noise pedestal.

Then,  as  the  decelerating  potential  of  the  second
grid  increases,  the  oscillations  become  more  compli-
cated  and  the  system  exhibits  chaotic  oscillations
(Fig. 1, regime C). Figure 2c shows the characteristics
of  chaotic  VC  oscillations.  Note  the  continuous  and
irregular character of the power spectrum of these oscil-
lations. The phase portrait corresponds to the regime of
a developed chaos and represents a chaotic attractor.

At  a  relatively  strong  deceleration  (∆ϕ  >  0.6),  the
system  once  again  exhibits  regular  VC  oscillations
(Fig. 1, region P3 in the vicinity of line 2). Figure 2d
shows the characteristics of regular oscillations corre-
sponding  to  a  relatively  strong  decelerating  potential
difference  between  the  grids  of  the  diode  gap  (∆ϕ  =
0.60). It is seen that, in comparison with regimes P1 and
P2,  regime  P3  corresponds  to  the  absence  of  a  noise
pedestal  in  the  spectrum  and  to  a  strongly  changed
shape of the phase portrait.

In the study of the beam with a nonstationary VC, it
is important to analyze the power of the observed VC
oscillations. In this regard, we consider variations in the
power of the VC oscillations as a function of the decel-
erating potential difference. In the model under study,
the  power  is  calculated  as  a  difference  of  the  kinetic
energies  of  electrons  that  enter  the  interaction  space
and the electrons that escape from the diode gap.

Figure 3 demonstrates the dependence of the oscil-
lation  power  in  the  beam  with  a VC  on  decelerating
potential  difference  ∆ϕ.  The  halftone  zone  with  the
regions corresponding to different oscillation regimes
(Fig.  1)  corresponds  to  the VC  generation  zone.  It  is
seen  that,  at  a  low  deceleration,  the  power  linearly
increases in the regime of regular oscillations. Then, as
parameter ∆ϕ increases, the power reaches a maximum
in the chaotic regime and monotonically decreases until
the moment when the VC steady state is established in
the system.

Thus, it is seen that an increase in the decelerating
potential at the control parameter α > 0.75 ﬁrst gives
rise  to  regular  VC  oscillations.  The  VC  oscillation
power  increases  linearly.  Then,  as  the  decelerating
potential difference increases, the oscillations become
more  complicated,  their  spectral  structure  and  phase
portrait  vary  (Fig.  2b),  and  the  chaotic  oscillations
emerge (Fig. 2c). With a further increase in the deceler-
ating  potential,  the  VC  oscillations  are  regularized:
ﬁrst, they become periodic (Fig. 2d); then, the oscilla-
tions are suppressed and a stationary VC is established
in the beam. In the chaotic regime, the power generated

in the system reaches the maximum level (Fig. 3) and,
then, decreases until the moment corresponding to for-
mation of a stationary VC. Obviously, the cause of the
steady state in a beam with a VC is a strong decelerating
ﬁeld that presses the VC toward the injection plane. In
this case, the electron ﬂux is reﬂected completely in the
region of the stationary VC and leaves the interaction
space through the ﬁrst grid.

3.  SELECTION  OF  COHERENT  STRUCTURES 
AND  PHYSICAL  PROCESSES
IN  THE  SYSTEM  UNDER  STUDY

Let  us  consider  physical  processes  in  an  electron
beam with a VC. For this purpose, we employ a conven-
tional  method  for  the  analysis  of  the  complicated
dynamics of distributed systems: the method of orthog-
onal  decomposition  of  spatiotemporal  data  with  the
Karhunen–Loéve (KL) expansion [31, 32]. This expan-
sion is helpful during the analysis of the structure for-
mation  and  complicated  dynamics  in  various  distrib-
uted  systems  and  in  the  problems  of  hydrodynamics,
plasma  physics,  and  microwave  electronics.  The  KL
method makes it possible to interpret the complicated
dynamics of a system with regard to the existence and
interaction of space–time structures [9, 12].

The application of this method in the analysis of the
complicated behavior of the VC in a beam of charged
particles enables one to select space–time structures in
the electron ﬂux that have characteristic spatial distri-
butions and time scales in the electron beam (electron
bunches)  whose  interaction  can  explain  features  of  a
beam with a VC [9, 12, 13].

the  space–time  distribution  of  any  physical  quantity

to reduce quantity ξ(x, t) to the zero mean value.

In this study, function ξ(x, t) represents the space–
time distribution of space-charge density ρ(x, t) of the
electron ﬂux in the diode gap.

Using the orthogonal decomposition of distribution
ρ(x,  t),  we  consider  oscillation-energy  distribution
Wi(∆ϕ) over the KL modes. Figure 4 demonstrates the
dependence of energy Wi of the ﬁrst seven KL modes
on  decelerating  potential  ∆ϕ  at  the  control  parameter
α =  0.9.  These  dependences  have  three  characteristic
regions: two regions where the mode energy is varied
relatively smoothly and one region (halftone region C)
with stepwise variations in the energy level. Below, we
refer to the oscillations that correspond to these regions
as the oscillations of the ﬁrst and second type, respec-
tively.

The  fact  that  the VC  oscillation  energy  is  concen-
trated in a few of the ﬁrst modes is a characteristic fea-
ture of the processes occurring in a beam with a VC.
Note that up to 60% of the energy is concentrated in the
highest mode (the left-hand region in the ﬁgure). The
energies  of  the  remaining  modes  decrease  sharply.  In
particular, the energies of the second and third modes
are W2 ≈ 16% and W3 ≈ 6%, respectively, etc.

For  the  decelerating  potential  range  ∆ϕ  (cid:1)  0.41–
0.46, we observe a modiﬁcation of the inner structure of
the electron ﬂux that lies in a stepwise energy redistri-
bution between the highest and lowest KL modes. As
the  ﬂux  deceleration  is  varied,  the  energy  of  the  ﬁrst
mode jumps from 60 to 20%, while the energy of the
lower  modes  increases.  Figure  5  demonstrates  the
dependence of mode energy Wi on mode number i for
oscillations of the ﬁrst (curve 1) and second (curve 2)
types. It is seen that the energy of the highest mode is
redistributed to the modes of lower orders. Note that the
number of structures with a relatively large energy (Wi
> 5%), which are important for the oscillation process,
increases also. The region of the oscillations of the sec-
ond type that corresponds to the energy redistribution
between the highest and lowest harmonics completely
coincides with the halftone beak in Fig. 1.

The  third  characteristic  region  (on  the  right-hand
side in Fig. 4) corresponds to the parameters of the cha-
otic (∆ϕ = 0.46–0.58) and periodic (∆ϕ = 0.580–0.725)
oscillations.  In  this  case,  the  energy  distribution  over
modes does not exhibit substantial variations in various
oscillation regimes.

and second type, respectively). Shades of gray show the charge density: white corresponds to the lowest density and dark gray and
black correspond to the highest density (a VC formed in the interaction space).

To interpret the physical processes that accompany
changes in the VC oscillation regimes with variations in
the decelerating potential, we consider variations in the
behavior  of  space-charge  density  ρ(x,  t)  in  space  and
time for the oscillations of the ﬁrst and second types.
Figure 6 demonstrates the corresponding distributions.
Shades  of  gray  indicate  the  space-charge  density  at
each point at a given moment. Figures 6a and 6b show
the  distributions  for  the  decelerating  potentials  ∆ϕ  =
0.37 and 0.43, respectively, that correspond to the oscil-
lations of the ﬁrst and second types. It is seen that the
spatial  distributions  have  different  space–time  struc-
tures in two different regimes characterized by signiﬁ-
cantly different energy distributions over modes. In the
ﬁrst case, the electron bunches are localized in a certain
spatial region in the vicinity of the point x = 0.4. In the

course of time, the charge is periodically delivered to
the  ﬁrst  accelerating  grid  with  characteristic  time  τ
(Fig. 6a). In the case shown in Fig. 6b, the VC performs
periodic  spatial  oscillations  around  the  point  x  ≈  0.4
with a relatively large amplitude rather than remaining
localized  in  a  relatively  small  area  of  the  interaction
space. Characteristic time τ
c of the VC oscillations is
approximately twice as long as τ (Fig. 6a).

The dynamics of the electron bunches in the VC area
can be easily traced with the aid of the corresponding
space–time diagrams of the electron ﬂux (Fig. 7). Fig-
ures 7a and 7b show these diagrams with the trajecto-
ries of the charged particles for the regimes shown in
Fig. 6. As the beam moves from the ﬁrst grid (x = 0) to
the second grid (x = 1) in the presence of a decelerating
potential, the charge is accumulated between the grids

in  the  diode  gap.  Thus,  the  potential  of  the  intergrid
space decreases. A VC is formed at the moment when
the potential of a certain area becomes equal to zero.
When  charges  are  accumulated  in  the  VC  area,  the
potential  barrier  becomes  higher,  a  minor  drift  of  the
electron bunch takes place, and the charge is dropped
toward the ﬁrst grid with a positive potential relative to
the VC. Thus, the potential barrier becomes lower and
the electrons can cross the gap between the grids. This
process  is  periodically  repeated  with  a  certain  repeti-
tion rate. In the region corresponding to oscillations of
the second type, the process is qualitatively different. In
this case, the VC periodically oscillates in space around
some  mean  value.  The  repetition  rate  of  the  process
decreases by a factor of approximately 2.

To study physical processes in a beam with a VC, we
need such characteristic of the beam as the velocity dis-
tribution of charged particles. Figure 8 shows velocity
distributions  for  the  regimes  of  the  ﬁrst  and  second
types. This  distribution  was  determined  in  the  spatial

plane  with  the  coordinate  x  =  0.3.  The  coordinate  at
which we measure the electron velocity distribution is
such  that  the  corresponding  spatial  plane  is  located
between the ﬁrst grid and the region of VC oscillations
and does not belong to the latter. It is seen that different
velocity distributions of the electron ﬂux correspond to
oscillations of the ﬁrst and second type. In the case of
oscillations of the second type, the velocity distribution
is  substantially  wider. A  possible  reason  for  this  cir-
cumstance  is  that  a  relatively  large  amplitude  of  the
spatial VC oscillations in the second regime leads to a
signiﬁcant  enhancement  of  the  effect  of  the  potential
barrier on the velocity of the electron beam in the vicin-
ity of the ﬁrst grid. This phenomenon results in a sub-
stantial velocity modulation of the electron ﬂux in the
vicinity  of  the  ﬁrst  grid.  Let  us  discuss  this  effect  in
more detail.

A forced modulation of the electron ﬂux in the oscil-
lation regime of the ﬁrst type makes it possible to dem-
onstrate the strength of the effect of VC oscillations on

the electron-ﬂux velocity in the vicinity of the ﬁrst grid
for  the  oscillation  regime  of  the  second  type.  Let  the
electron-ﬂux modulation in the vicinity of the ﬁrst grid
be represented as

v = v0(1 + msin(2πfct)),

(10)

where  v0  is  the  unperturbed  velocity  of  the  electron
ﬂux, m is the modulation depth, and fc = 1/τ
c is the fre-
quency  that  corresponds  to  the  VC  oscillation  fre-
quency  in  the  oscillation  regime  of  the  second  type
(Fig. 7b).

Figure  8c  shows  the  velocity  distribution  for  the
oscillations of the ﬁrst type in the presence of additional
forced modulation (10). It is seen that, in the case of a
periodic modulation, the velocity distribution broadens
and  becomes  approximately  twice  as  broad  as  the
velocity distribution plotted for the same decelerating
potential in the absence of modulation (Fig. 8a).

To corroborate the data obtained, we calculated the
dependence of the KL-mode energy on the modulation
depth  of  the  electron-ﬂux  velocity  (Fig.  9).  It  is  seen
that  an  increase  in  the  modulation  depth  causes  a
decrease in the energy of the ﬁrst mode and an increase
in the energies of lower modes. The same behavior of
the mode energies is observed in the case of oscillations
of the second type (Fig. 4).

Thus, on the basis of the electron velocity distribu-
tions  and  the  dependence  of  the  mode  energy  on  the
modulation depth, we draw the conclusion that the elec-
tron-ﬂux velocity is strongly modulated in the vicinity
of the ﬁrst grid in the case of oscillations of the second
type. This modulation is not observed for oscillations of
the ﬁrst type. The VC oscillations become more com-
plicated,  and  the  number  of  signiﬁcant  KL  modes
increases with an increase in the modulation depth.

4. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF THE PROCESSES 
IN A  BEAM WITH A VIRTUAL  CATHODE
IN THE PRESENCE OF A DECELERATING FIELD

To corroborate the results of numerical simulation
of the nonlinear dynamics of an electron beam with a
VC in the presence of a decelerating ﬁeld, we experi-
mentally studied oscillations in a beam with a VC. In
the  experiments,  we  used  a  prototype  of  the  diode
scheme  similar  to  the  scheme  used  in  the  numerical
simulation.  In  the  experimental  setup,  the  electron
beam generated by an electron-optical system (EOS) is
injected into a diode that consists of two grid electrodes
with  a  decelerating  ﬁeld  (Fig.  10a).  The  decelerating
ﬁeld is generated owing to negative potential V of the
output (second) grid relative to the input (ﬁrst) grid.

A hot cathode that works in the space-charge-lim-
ited  mode  serves  as  a  source  of  electrons.  The  EOS
forms  an  axially  symmetric  converging  cylindrical
electron  beam.  In  the  experiments,  the  accelerating
voltage of the electron beam is 1.5 kV. The beam cur-
rent  at  the  EOS  exit  (100  mA)  is  determined  by  the
cathode  heating.  The  electron-velocity  spread  at  the
EOS exit is relatively low (no greater than 0.2% in rel-
ative  units),  so  that  the  electron  beam  is  assumed  a
monovelocity beam.

The electron beam from the EOS exit arrives at the
grid (diode) gap. Potential V0 of the ﬁrst grid is equal to
anode potential Va (accelerating voltage), whereas the
potential of the second grid Vd = V0 – ∆Vd ranges from
Vd /V0 = 1 (∆Vd = 0, in the absence of deceleration) to
Vd/V0 = 0 (∆Vd = V0, in the case of the complete decel-
eration of the electron ﬂux). Quantity ∆Vd is the poten-

tial  difference  between  the  grids  that  generates  the
static decelerating ﬁeld in the diode gap.

When  decelerating  potential  difference  ∆Vd
between  the  grids  of  the  diode  gap  increases,  we
observe formation of a VC in the electron ﬂux. The VC
oscillations  in  time  and  space  modulate  the  electron
beam, so that electrons are partially reﬂected from the
VC toward the input grid. Thus, chaotic VC oscillations
emerge  in  the  system.  The  shape  and  power  of  these
oscillations  substantially  depend  on  potential  differ-
ence ∆Vd between the grids of the diode gap.

To analyze the noiselike oscillations in the electron
beam,  we  employ  a  broadband  fragment  of  a  helical
slow-wave structure (FHSWS) loaded with an absorb-
ing insert and an energy output as well as a fragment of
a wideband coaxial line loaded with a capacitance (HF
probe) that can be translated along three perpendicular
axes  [22].  The  coaxial  probe  is  supplemented  with  a
decelerating grid for the spectral analysis of the longi-
tudinal velocities of charged particles. In the diode gap,
the  velocity-  and  density-modulated  electron  beam
excites  the  FHSWS,  whose  signal  is  studied  with  an
SCh-60  spectrum  analyzer.  This  technique  makes  it
possible to determine the spectral power density of the
noise  of  oscillations  generated  by  an  electron  beam
with a VC.

The experiments were performed on an assembled
vacuum  setup  (Fig.  10b)  under  continuous  evacuation
with a minimum residual gas pressure of 10–7–10–6 Torr.
As  was  mentioned,  the  oscillations  in  the  system
under study are determined by the presence of a VC in
the intergrid space with a decelerating ﬁeld. The exper-

iments  have  shown  that,  at  a  relatively  low  value  of
decelerating  potential  difference  ∆Vd/V0,  the  oscilla-
tions  are  not  observed  in  the  electron  beam.  When
deceleration  of  the  beam  electrons  increases  (∆Vd/V0
increases),  a VC  is  formed  in  the  system  at  a  certain
critical  level  of  the  potential  difference,  [∆Vd /V0]cr.
Electrons are partially reﬂected from the VC toward the
ﬁrst grid of the diode. At low deceleration, the VC oscil-
lations are nearly regular and the spectrum of the gen-
erated radiation is discrete. Wideband noiselike oscilla-
tions are generated in the system when deceleration of
electrons is increased. At a relatively high deceleration,
generation vanishes again.

Figure  11  demonstrates  the  power  spectra  of  the
microwave oscillations that were measured experimen-
tally at various decelerating potentials. It is seen that an
increase in deceleration leads to a gradual complication
of  the  power  spectrum. As  the  decelerating  potential
increases,  the  system  exhibits  various  regimes.  First,
we observe single-frequency oscillations that are char-
acterized  by  a  relatively  narrow  spectrum  (Fig.  11a).
Then,  as  this  parameter  increases,  the  oscillations
become  multifrequency  and  the  spectrum  becomes
more complicated but remains discrete at low decelera-
tion  levels  (Figs.  11b,  11c).  The  VC  oscillation  fre-
quency increases. When deceleration further increases
(while ∆Vd/V0 increases), the oscillations become cha-
otic at certain potentials of the second grid. The spec-
trum  becomes  continuous  in  a  relatively  wide  fre-
quency range. This scenario of the development of cha-
otic  oscillations  is  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the
theoretical analysis of the processes in the diode gap in
the presence of a decelerating ﬁeld.

Figure 12a shows the dependence of the normalized
integral  oscillation  power  on  potential  difference
∆Vd/V0  between  the  grids  at  the  electron  velocity
spread ∆v/v0
 ~ 0.2%. It is seen that, at low decelera-
tion, integral power PΣ of the oscillations in the beam
with a VC is relatively small. When ∆Vd /V0 increases,
the power increases and reaches its maximum value at
a certain optimal decelerating potential. Then, the inte-
gral  oscillation  power  decreases.  The  experimental
dependence is in qualitative agreement with the theo-
retical dependence (Fig. 3). In addition, Fig. 12a shows
quantity K (the electron-beam transmission efﬁciency),
determined as the ratio of output current Iout of the sec-
ond  grid  to  beam  current  I0  of  the  electron  gun:  K  =
Iout/I0.  It  is  seen  that  an  increase  in  the  decelerating
potential leads to a monotonic decrease in K (in contrast
to  integral  oscillation  power  PΣ).  This  circumstance
means that an increase in decelerating potential differ-
ence ∆Vd causes an increase in the number of electrons
reﬂected from the VC or in the diode gap behind the VC
toward  the  input  grid.  At  a  certain  (relatively  high)
potential difference ∆Vd between the grids, we observe
almost total reﬂection of electrons from the VC, so that
the electron-beam transmission becomes close to zero

the  decelerating  potential  in  which  the  oscillations  in
the beam with a VC are absent (region S), the region of
regular VC  oscillations  (region  P),  and  the  region  of
chaotic wideband generation (region C). It is seen that
the  system  demonstrates  a  transition  from  the  steady
state to chaotic oscillations through the region of aperi-
odic dynamics. Note that an increase in the decelerating
potential results in complication of chaotic oscillations
(broadening of the generated frequency band and regu-
larization of the power spectrum).

Thus,  the  experimental  data  qualitatively  conﬁrm
the results obtained during numerical simulation of the
nonlinear dynamics of an electron ﬂux with a VC. The
processes  occurring  in  the  beam  after  formation  and
interaction  of  electron  structures  observed  in  the
numerical simulation need to be studied additionally in
experiments.

CONCLUSIONS

The  nonlinear  nonstationary  processes  in  an  elec-
tron beam with a VC in the diode gap with a decelerat-
ing potential have been studied theoretically and exper-

imentally.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  system
exhibits  versatile  dynamics  (from  single-frequency
oscillations to developed wideband chaotic VC oscilla-
tions) under variations in the control parameters (pri-
marily, the decelerating potential). The regions that cor-
respond  to  various  regimes  of  VC  oscillations  have
been  plotted  on  the  map  of  parameters  (decelerating
potential ∆ϕ and Pierce parameter α). Using the Kar-
hunen–Loéve  expansion  (orthogonal  decomposition),
we have selected various types of the VC behavior in
the  presence  of  a  decelerating  ﬁeld  and  have  demon-
strated  that  these  types  are  characterized  by  different
types  of  space–time  dynamics  in  the  electron  beam
with a VC. The analysis of the physical processes has
shown  that  variations  in  the VC  dynamics  are  deter-
mined by an increase in the electron-velocity modula-
tion at the VC oscillation frequency in the vicinity of
the input grid.

A distinctive feature of the system under study is the
possibility of effectively controlling oscillation regimes
in the system with the help of a variation in decelerating
potential difference ∆ϕ in the diode gap. Note the pos-
sibility for tuning of the system from the regime of reg-
ular oscillations with a narrow spectrum to the regime
of chaotic oscillations with a wideband generation and
a uniform spectrum.

The experimental study of a prototype of this phys-
ical system shows that the proposed numerical model
yields  a  sufﬁciently  accurate  qualitative  (and,  partly,
quantitative) interpretation of the features of a real sys-
tem  with  a  VC  in  the  diode  gap  with  a  decelerating
potential.

Abstract 
 
We study the performance of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in gaseous He, Ne and Ne+H2 at temperatures in 
the range of 2.6-293 K. In He, at temperatures between 62 and 293 K, the triple-GEM structures often operate at 
rather high gains, exceeding 1000. There is an indication that this high gain is achieved by Penning effect in the 
gas  impurities  released  by  outgassing.  At  lower  temperatures  the  gain-voltage  characteristics  are  significantly 
modified probably due to the freeze-out of impurities. In particular, the double-GEM and single-GEM structures 
can operate down to 2.6 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas density of about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities 
the maximum gain drops further. In Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures. The gain drop in 
Ne at low temperatures can be reestablished in Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very high gains, exceeding 104, have 
been obtained in these mixtures at 50-60 K, at a density of 9.2 g/l corresponding to that of saturated Ne vapor near 
27 K. The results obtained are relevant in the fields of two-phase He and Ne detectors for solar neutrino detection 
and electron avalanching at low temperatures.

1.  Introduction 

The  studies  of  Gas  Electron  Multipliers 
(GEMs)  [1]  at  cryogenic  temperatures  have 
been  motivated  by  a  growing  interest  in  the 
development of cryogenic detectors operated in 
an  electron-avalanching  mode.  Such  detectors,

termed  “cryogenic  avalanche  detectors”  [2], 
may find applications in cryogenic experiments 
where the primary ionization signal is weak: in 
solar  neutrino  detection  [3],  dark  matter 
searches  [4],  coherent  neutrino  scattering  [5] 
and Positron Emission Tomography [6].  

The  unique  property  of  GEM  structures  is 
that  they  can  operate  in  noble  gases  at  high

demonstrated  that  the  triple-GEM  [2,9]  and 
single-GEM  [10]  structures  can  successfully 
operate  in  gaseous  He,  Ar  and  Kr  and  in  two-
phase Kr in the range of 120-300 K.  

[12],  namely 

The  interest  in  GEM  performance  at  low 
temperatures,  below  the  liquid  nitrogen  point 
(78 K), has been  triggered by the so-called “e-
bubble  chamber”  project  for  solar  neutrino 
detection  [3,11].  In  this  project,  the  proposed 
two-phase  detector  should  operate  in  those 
liquids  that  could  provide  the  formation  of 
electron  bubbles 
in  neon, 
hydrogen  or  helium.  The  corresponding 
operation  temperatures  would  be  below  27,  20 
or  4.2  K.  Furthermore,  the  detector  should  be 
able  to  amplify  the  ionization  signal  produced 
in the liquid using a gas multiplier, for instance 
the  GEM,  operated  in  a  saturated  vapor  above 
the  liquid phase. The latter is a real challenge. 
For example, the saturated He vapor density at 
4.2 K (16 g/l) corresponds to the gas density at 
room  temperature  at  a  pressure  of  101  atm.  
Very little is known about electron avalanching 
at low temperatures and at such a high density 
[13].  

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  only  three 
groups  have  experimental  results  relevant  to 
this subject: those of the  GEM performance in 
He  at  cryogenic  temperatures  [2,9,10],  the 
proportional  counter  operation  in  He  near  4  K 
[14,15] and the cryogenic glow discharge in He 
[16].

In  this  paper,  the  performance  of  GEM 
structures  in  gaseous  He,  Ne  and  Ne+H2  are 
studied  for  the  first  time  at  low  temperatures, 
down  to  2.6  K,  aiming  at  their  potential 
applications  in  the  e-bubble  chamber  and  at 
investigations  of  electron  avalanching  at  low 
temperatures. Gain characteristics, pulse shapes 
and interpretation of the results are presented.  

 
2. Experimental procedure 

A  detailed  description  of  the  experimental 
setup  will  be  presented  elsewhere  [19].  The 
setup  was  developed  at  Nevis  Laboratories 
(Columbia  University) 
and  Brookhaven 
National Laboratory. Fig. 1 shows the principal 
features  of  the  setup  relevant  to  the  present 
study.  Three  GEM  foils  and  a  photocathode 
were  mounted  in  a  test  vessel  of  a  volume  of 
1.6  l,  termed  the  “tracking  chamber”,  which 
was  placed  inside  the  cryostat.  The  chamber 
was  connected  to  a  tube  which  was  in  direct 
contact with a reservoir filled with a cryogenic 
liquid.  In  the  range  of  78-290  K  the  reservoir 
was filled with liquid nitrogen, and below 78 K 
with  liquid  helium.    The  chamber  was  filled 
with  appropriate  gases,  He,  Ne  or  H2,  taken 
directly  from  the  bottles,  with  quoted  purities 
of 99.999%.

The  photocathode  was  composed  of  a 
semitransparent gold film deposited on a quartz 
substrate.  The  chamber  and  the  cryostat  had 
UV windows at the bottom, to transmit the light 
to  the  photocathode  from  a  high-powered  Xe 
flash  lamp,  placed  underneath.  The  lamp  was 
pulsed  once  per  second  using  a  generator, 
which  also  served  as  a  trigger  for  the  signal 
readout.  The  width  of  the  light  pulse  was 
approximately 2 m s.  

The  GEMs  were  produced  by  the  CERN 
workshop and had the following parameters: 50 
m m  thick  kapton,  70  and  55  m m  hole  diameter 
on  the  metal  and  kapton  center  respectively, 
140 m m hole pitch and 28· 28 mm2 active area. 
The  GEM  foils  were  mounted  on  G10  frames. 
The distances between the first GEM (GEM1 in 
Fig.  1)  and  the  photocathode,  and  between  the 
GEMs, were 10 mm and 2 mm, respectively.  

The  GEM  electrodes  were  biased  through  a 
resistive high-voltage divider placed outside the 
cryostat  and  including  three  identical  circuits 
connected  in  parallel  (Fig.2).  The  divider  was 
slightly  modified  compared  to that  of Ref.  [9], 
to  provide better protection against discharges. 
Each  GEM  electrode  was  connected  to  the 
divider  using  high-voltage  feedthroughs  and  3 
m  long  wires.  All  resistors  in  the  divider  were 
equal,  providing  an  equal  voltage  drop  across 
the GEMs and the gaps between them. 

The  GEM  multiplier  could  operate  in  a 
single-,  double-  or  triple-GEM  configuration, 
denoted 
as  1GEM,  2GEM  or  3GEM 
respectively, in accordance with terminology of 
Ref.  [7].  Accordingly,  the  avalanche  (anode)

3. GEM operation in He 

Fig.3  shows  gain-voltage  characteristics  of 
the triple-GEM in He in the range of 39-293 K. 
Most  data  were  obtained  at  a  gas  density  of 
about  0.5  g/l,  corresponding  to  a pressure of 3 
atm  at  room  temperature.  The  data  at  293  K 
were  obtained  at  room  temperature  when  the 
cryostat  reservoir  was  empty.  The  data  in  the 
range of 78-240 and below 40 K were obtained 
during  the  cooling-down  procedure,  when  the 
reservoir  was  filled  with  liquid  nitrogen  and 
liquid  helium  respectively.    The  data  at  62  K

increase  of  the  voltage  and  by  a  dramatic 
decrease  of  the  maximum  gain.  At  39  K  the 
maximum  gain  dropped  considerably,  below 
10. Here the maximum gain was limited by the 
onset  of  a  sustained  discharge.  We  found  that

ion 
elements is responsible for this behavior in the 
triple-GEM at low temperatures. 

In contrast, the double-GEM and single-GEM 
were able to operate at low temperatures in an 
avalanche  mode  (see  Figs.3-5).    Fig.4  shows 
gain-voltage  characteristics  of  the  single-GEM 
and  double-GEM  at  4.2  K  in  comparison  with 
those  at  78  K.  At  lower  temperatures  the 
operation  voltages  increase  and  the  curve 
slopes  decrease,  indicating  a  change  in  the 
avalanche  mechanism  when  going  from  liquid 
nitrogen  to  liquid  helium  temperatures.  On  the 
other hand, no difference in gain characteristics 
was  observed  below  20  K.  This  is  seen  in 
particular in Fig. 5 when comparing the data at 
4.4 and 2.6 K.  

A  typical  avalanche  signal  from  the  double-
GEM  in  He  at  4.2  K  is  shown  in  Fig.  6.    One 
can  see  that  the  pulse  width  of  the  avalanche 
(primary)  signal  is  practically  identical  to  that 
of  the  calibration  signal.  That  means  that  the 
avalanche  signal  in  He  at  low  temperatures  is 
faster  than  the  shaping  time  of  the  amplifier 
(1.5  m s).  The  avalanche  signal  is  slightly 
delayed  with  respect  to  the  calibration  signal, 
by  1.3  m s.  This  presumably  corresponds  to  the 
electron  drift  time  from  the  first  to  second 
GEM.  

At higher gains the primary signal starts to be 
accompanied  by  a  secondary  signal,  with  a 
width  of  a  few  tens  of  microseconds  at  4.2  K 
(Fig.  6,  bottom).  It  is  interesting  that  at  lower

temperatures, namely at 2.6 K, the width of the 
secondary  signal  increases  by  two  orders  of 
magnitude,  up  to  a  few  milliseconds  (Fig.  7, 
top,  middle).    The  origin  of  the  secondary 
signals is unclear.  It is possibly related to long-
lived metastable atoms created in an avalanche. 
In  principle  they  might  be  responsible  for 
ionization processes at such a large time-scale.  
At  4.2  K  and  at  a  density  of  0.55  g/l,  the 
maximum gains of the single-GEM and double-
and  60

in  Fig.  8.  The  maximum  density  reached  was 
1.6  g/l,  at  2.6  K.  This  density  corresponds  to 
that of saturated He vapor at 2.3 K. One can see 
that 
the  gain  curve  slope  decreases  with 
increasing  density.  In  addition,  the  maximum 
gain  at  1.6  g/l  falls  to  a  rather  small  value,  of 
about  5  for  the  double-GEM.  Such  a  strong

densities,  above  1  g/l.  This  means  that  GEM 
structures can hardly operate in saturated vapor 
in  the  two-phase  mode  at  4.2  K,  with  a 
reasonable gain. On the contrary, low densities, 
below  about  0.5  g/l,  may  provide  good  GEM 
performance  at  high  gains.  For  example,  the 
density  value  of  0.6  g/l,  at  which  the  double-
GEM has a gain of several tens, corresponds to 
the density of saturated He vapor at 1.9 K. The 
saturated  vapor  density  could  also  be  reduced 
further,  by  an  order  of  magnitude,  if  the 
temperature is lowered down to 1.3 K. At such 
a  low  density  one  might  expect  a  significant 
increase of the GEM gain.

with  earlier  observation  [9],  despite  the  fact 
that  the  kapton resistivity is extremely large at 
these  temperatures.  In  particular,  gain-voltage 
characteristics do not deviate from exponential 
behavior.  

In  addition,  no fatigue effects  were observed 
between the cooling-warming runs which were 
done  during  the  present  study.    Some  GEM 
elements  were  changed  between  the  runs  and 
some  were  left.  The  results  nevertheless  were 
reproducible.    These  observations  demonstrate 
that  the  GEM  structures  can  operate  down  to 
liquid helium temperatures.   

 
4. GEM operation in Ne

Fig.9 (top, open points) shows a gain-voltage 
characteristic of the  triple-GEM in Ne at room 
temperature, 
a  density  of  4.2  g/l 
to  a  pressure  of  5  atm. 
corresponding 
According  to  previous  results  [18],  the  GEM 
operation at this density is efficient in terms of 
the  maximum  gain.  Indeed,  the  maximum gain 
in  Fig.  9  exceeds  1000.  However,  below  room 
temperature, namely at 160 and 78 K, we found 
that  the  operation  voltages  increased  and  that 
the  triple-GEM  was  unable  to  operate  in 
amplification mode due to the discharge onset. 
This behavior resembles that observed in He at 
temperatures below 40 K.   

Fortunately,  neon  has  an  advantage  over 
helium:  it  can  form  Penning  mixtures  with 
hydrogen  at  low  temperatures.  Indeed,  the 
boiling point of hydrogen is below that of neon. 
It is known that Ne and H2 constitute a Penning 
pair where the energy of the metastable state of 
neon  (Nem)  exceeds  the  ionization  energy  of 
hydrogen,

mixture  Ne+H2,  which  should  be  effective 
down to 20 K. 

Fig.  9  shows  gain-voltage  characteristics  of 
the  single-GEM,  double-GEM  and  triple-GEM 
at 55-57 K in the Penning mixtures Ne+0.2%H2 
and Ne+0.1%H2. The gas densities were 4.1 g/l 
and  9.2  g/l  respectively.  Note  that  the  latter 
density  value  is  close  to  that  required  for 
operation  in  the  two-phase  mode  near  27  K. 
The  measurements  were  done  during 
the 
warming-up procedure, after liquid helium was 
removed from the reservoir. 

One can see that rather high gains, exceeding 
104,  are  obtained 
these  mixtures:  no 
in 
discharges  were  observed  at  these  gains.  We 
believe  that  such  a  successful  performance  of 
Ne+H2  mixtures  will  be  preserved  at  lower 
temperatures, down to 27 K. 

High  gain  operation  of  the  triple-GEM  in 
Ne+0.1%H2  is  further  illustrated  in  Fig.  10, 
showing  a  typical  avalanche  signal.  One  can 
see that the avalanche signal is slower than that 
in  He at low  temperatures (Fig.  6). It is wider, 
by approximately 2 m s, and delayed, by 5.1 m s, 
with respect to the calibration signal. The delay 
is determined by the electron drift time between 
the  GEMs  and  by  the  avalanche  development 
time  within  the  GEM  holes.  The  latter  will  be 
discussed in detail in the following section. 

 
5. Discussion 

We 

tried 

to  understand  the  temperature 
dependence  of  the  gain-voltage  characteristics 
observed  in  He  and  Ne  by  analyzing  their 
ionization  coefficients.  They  were  estimated 
using an approach described in Ref. [18]. Each 
GEM  hole  is  approximated  by  a  parallel-plate 
counter with an electric field taken equal to that 
calculated  in  the  center  of  the  hole  [21].  The 
ionization coefficient a  is related to the single-
GEM gain M as follows:

On the other hand, the ionization coefficients

In  Ref.  [18]  the  enhancement  of  ionization

The  interpretation  was  based  on  the  observed 
pressure dependence of ionization coefficients. 
Namely, 
the  contribution  of  associative 
ionization  should  increase  with  gas  density  in 
proportion to the density. At low temperatures, 
the  associative  ionization  contribution  should 
decrease,  in  proportion  to  or  faster  than  T1/2 
[15]. 

We  suppose  that  in  the  present  study  an 
alternative  mechanism  for  this  enhancement, 
namely  the  Penning  ionization  of  impurities,

might  play  a  decisive  role.  Indeed,  there  is  a 
correlation  between 
the 
operation voltage and the cooling medium used 
in the cryostat reservoir (Fig. 3). The transition 
from  293  to  238  K  is  provided  by  liquid 
nitrogen and from 78 to 39 K by liquid helium 
filling. Accordingly, the tube in Fig.1 may work 
trap  removing  CO2  and  H2O 
as  a  cold 
impurities  at  liquid  nitrogen  filling  and  Ar,  O2 
and  N2  impurities  at  liquid  helium  filling.  The 
correlation might be explained by the presence 
of  these  impurities  in  He  or  Ne  which  might 
induce the Penning effect. Their removal would 
result in an increase in the operation voltage. In 
this  sense,  only  the  measurements  at  low 
temperatures,  below  40  K,  would  be  in  really 
pure He.  

Fig.  12  shows  a  comparison  of  ionization 
coefficients  in  Ne  at  room  temperature  and  in 
Ne+H2 at low temperatures estimated from our 
data,  with  those  at  room  temperature  and  low 
density taken from literature [23]. Similar to the 
He  case,  the  ionization  coefficients  in  Ne 
deduced from our measurements are enhanced. 
The enhancement is higher in Penning mixtures 
Ne+(0.1-0.2)%H2. 

Long-lived  metastable  states  play  a  crucial 
role  in  the  Penning  mechanism.  Evidence  for 
their presence in an avalanche was obtained by 
analyzing  the  time  properties  of  the  signals.  
Indeed,  it  was  observed  that  the  avalanche 
signals from the triple-GEM in He at 62 K and 
in  Ne  at  room  temperature  are  substantially 
delayed  with  respect  to  the  calibration  signal.  
The delay is of the order of 10 m s.  This is seen 
from  Fig.  13,  which  should  be  compared  to 
calibration  signal  in  Fig.  6.    The  delay  is  too 
large to be explained by the electron drift time 
between  the  GEMs,  and  thus  can  be  induced 
only by the avalanche development time.   

It is interesting that the delay is a logarithmic 
function  of  the  gain,  as  is  clearly  seen  in  Fig. 
this

dependence. Let t be the life-time of an excited 
atom before ionization collision. The avalanche 
time  in  a  single  GEM  is  approximately  equal

Thus,  the  line  slope  in  Fig.  14  provides  an 
estimation  of  the  life-time  of  an  excited  atom: 
t  = 2.4 m s.  

It is  apparent that only  metastable atoms can 
live  such  a  long  time.  Concerning  the  Penning 
mechanism,  estimations  showed  that  the  N2 
impurity  concentration  corresponding  to  this 
life-time  would  be  about  5· 10-5.  Another 
conclusion 
contribution  of 
associative  ionization  at  temperatures  near  78 
K  is  ruled  out  (at  least  in  the  present  studies), 
since the associative ionization is a fast process 
going through the resonance atomic states with 
a typical decay time below 10-7 s [24,25].

In Ref. [16] this process was considered as the 
principle  mechanism  of  the  glow  discharge  at 
temperatures  near  and  below  78  K.  Two  facts 
support  this  mechanism.  First,  it  goes  through 
metastable  atoms,  which  we  know  exist  in  the 
avalanche.  Second,  its  contribution  at  low 
temperatures  should  decrease  [25].  It  is  not

temperature.  At 

We  have  studied  the  GEM  performance  in 
gaseous  He,  Ne 
low 
temperatures, in the range of 2.6-293 K. In the 
range  of  62-293  K  in  He,  the  triple-GEM 
structures  can  operate  at  rather  high  gains, 
exceeding  1000.  In  the  range  of 62-238 K, the 
gain-voltage  characteristics  are  independent  of 
the 
temperatures 
however  they  are  significantly  modified:  the 
operation  voltages  increase  and  the  maximum 
gains  decrease.  In  particular,  the  double-GEM 
and single-GEM structures can operate down to 
2.6  K  at  gains  reaching  only  several  tens,  at  a 
gas density of about 0.5 g/l. At higher densities 
the maximum gain drops even more. In Ne, the 
maximum  gain  also  drops  at  cryogenic 
temperatures. 

lower 

In  Ne,  the  problem  of  the  gain  drop  at  low 
temperatures  has  been  solved  using  Penning 
mixtures  Ne+(0.1-0.2)%H2.    Very  high  gains, 
exceeding 104, were obtained in these mixtures 
at 50-60 K, at densities corresponding to that of 
saturated Ne vapor at 27 K. 

At  temperatures  below  20  K,  the  ionization 
coefficients in dense He are in accordance with 
those  measured  at  room  temperature  and  low 
densities.  This  supports  the  statement  that  the 
principal  avalanche  mechanism  in  He  at  low 
temperatures is electron impact ionization. 

On the other hand, the avalanche mechanism 
in He and Ne near and above 78 K is not fully 
understood. Most probably it is due to Penning 
impurities,  although  another 
ionization  of 
Penning  process,  due  to  collisions  between 
metastable atoms, is not excluded.

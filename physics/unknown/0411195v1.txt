Abstract 
 
The golden mean, Φ, has been applied in diverse situations in art, architecture and music, 
and although some have claimed that it represents a basic aesthetic proportion, others 
have argued that it is only one of a large number of such ratios. We review its early 
history, especially its relationship to the Mount Meru of Pingala. We examine the 
succession divisions of 3, 7, and 22 in Indian music and suggest that it was derived from 
a multiplicative sequence arising from a variant of Mount Meru. We also speculate on the 
neurophysiological basis behind the sense that the golden mean is a pleasant proportion.  
 
 
   
 
 
Introduction 
  
Two and a half years ago, in 2002, the celebrated Philippine composer Jose Maceda 
organized a Symposium on “A Search in Asia for a New Theory of Music” in Manila. 
His objective was to explore Asian mathematical sources that may be helpful in 
providing a direction to world music everywhere. The papers at the Symposium have 
since appeared as a book (Buenconsejo, 2003). At this meeting, Maceda had many 
conversations with me regarding what he put as the “aesthetics of Asian court musics 
which seek permanence with little change.” I told Maceda that I considered the dhvani-
theory of suggestion particularly insightful, since it made the audience central to the 
process of illumination of the essential sentiment behind the artistic creation (e.g. Ingalls 
et al, 1990). According to this view the permanence being sought is the “universal” that 
can only be approached and never quite reached by the diverse paths that represent 
different cultural experiences. 
 
Maceda appreciated the fact that physiological geometry plays in perception and 
aesthetics, but he was emphatic that there was a cultural component to it and that there 
could be no unique canon of beauty in art. I take this thought as the starting point of my 
discussion of the golden proportion (Φ = 1.618..), which is defined by Φ = 1/(Φ – 1), 
which some theorists have claimed is fundamental to aesthetics. The conception of it as a 
pleasing shape arose in the late 1800's and there are no written texts that support such 
usage in the ancient world. Indeed, many non-Western cultures either do not speak of a 
unique ideal or consider other ratios as ideal, such as √2 of the Islamic architecture.

Adolf Zeising (1854) appears to have been the first to propose the romantic notion that in 
the golden ratio “is contained the fundamental principle of all formation striving to 
beauty and totality in the realm of nature and in the field of the pictorial arts.” Two 
prominent 20th century architects, Ernst Neufert and Le Corbusier, used this ratio 
deliberately in their designs. More recently, many industrial designs (such as the 
dimensions of the ubiquitous credit card) have been based on it. Avant-garde musicians 
such as Debussy, Bartok, and Xenakis have composed melodic lines where the intervals 
are according to this ratio. Salvador Dali used this proportion in some canvases. 
Cartwright et al (2002) argue its importance in music. 
 
But such usage does not make it an aesthetic law, and Mario Livio (2002a) debunks this 
pretension effectively, showing that the research on which this claim has been made is 
ambiguous at best. I agree with Livio’s warning that “literature is bursting with false 
claims and misconceptions about the appearance of the Golden Ratio in the arts (e.g. in 
the works of Giotto, Seurat, Mondrian). The history of art has nevertheless shown that 
artists who have produced works of truly lasting value are precisely those who have 
departed from any formal canon for aesthetics. In spite of the Golden Ratio's truly 
amazing mathematical properties, and its propensity to pop up where least expected in 
natural phenomena, I believe that we should abandon its application as some sort of 
universal standard for ‘beauty,’ either in the human face or in the arts.” (Livio, 2002b) 
 
In this note I first present the background to the golden mean and its relationship to the 
Mount Meru (Meru-Prastāra) of Pingala (c. 200 BC but perhaps 450 BC if the many 
textual notices about him being the younger brother of the great grammarian Panini are 
right) and its subsequent exposition by other mathematicians. The term “golden section” 
(goldene Schnitt) seems to first have been used by Martin Ohm in the 1835 edition of the 
textbook Die Reine Elementar-Mathematik. The first known use of this term in English is 
in James Sulley's 1875 article on aesthetics in the 9th edition of the Encyclopedia 
Britannica.  
 
Next, I present multiplicative variants of Mount Meru and the Fibonacci sequence that 
may explain why the octave of Indian music has 22 micronotes (śruti), a question that 
interested Jose Maceda. I also discuss other sequences related to the Mount Meru, 
including those that were described by the musicologist and musical scale theorist Ervin 
Wilson. I conclude by a discussion of the question of aesthetic universals that was raised 
by Jose Maceda.  
 
 
Historical Background 
 
As historical background, one must go to Pingala's Chandahśāstra 8.32-33 (see, for 
example, Weber, 1863; Singh, 1936; Singh, 1985; Nooten, 1993), in which while 
classifying poetic meters of long and short syllables, Pingala presents the Mount Meru 
(Meru-Prastāra, ‘steps of Mount Meru’, but Meru-Khanda, ‘portion of Mount Meru’ by 
Bhāskara II in his Līlāvatī written in 1150), which is also known as the Pascal’s triangle

(Figure 1). The shallow diagonals of the Mount Meru sum to the Fibonacci series, whose 
limiting ratio is the golden mean (Figure 2). Pingala’s cryptic rules were explained by 
later commentators such as Kedāra (7th century) and Halāyudha (10th century).

The Fibonacci numbers are described by several Indian mathematicians in the centuries 
following Pingala as being produced by the rule F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1).  Virahānka (7th 
century) explicitly gives the numbers as  3, 5, 8, 13, 21. Further explanation regarding the 
numbers was presented by Gopāla (c. 1135) and the polymath Hemachandra Sūrī (1089-
1172). If we assume that long syllables take twice as long to say as short ones, 
Hemachandra was dealing with the problem: “If each line takes the same amount, what 
combination of short (S) and long (L) syllables can it have?”  The general answer is that a 

3

line that take n time units can be formed in F(n) ways. This was explicitly stated by 
Hemachandra in about 1150 AD. 
 
In Europe, Fibonacci published his Liber Abaci in 1202 with these numbers; the book 
was meant to introduce the Indian number system and its mathematics which he had 
learnt in North Africa from Arab teachers while a young man growing up there. 
Fibonacci speaks of his education in North Africa thus: “My father, who had been 
appointed by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan 
merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, 
and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and 
receive instruction in the school of accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the 
art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very 
soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.” 
 
It has been suggested that the name Gopala-Hemachandra numbers be used for the 
general sequence: 
 

 a, b, a+b, a+2b, 2a+3b, 3a+5b, … 

 
for any pair a, b, which for the case a=1, b=1 represents the Fibonacci numbers. This 
would then include the Lucas series for which a=2 and b=1. It would also include other 
series such as the one for which a=1 and b=21, which generates the numbers: 
 
 

1, 21, 22, 43, 65, 108, …. 

Narayana Pandita’s Ganita Kaumudi (1356) studies additive sequences where each term 
is the sum of the last  q  terms.  He poses the problem thus:  “A cow gives birth to a calf 
every year.  The calves become young and they begin giving birth to calves when they 
are three years old.  Tell me, O learned man, the number of progeny produced during 
twenty years by one cow.” (See Singh, 1936; and Singh, 1985 for details) 

The Mount Meru was also known in other countries. The Chinese call it “Yang Hui's 
triangle” after Yang Hui (c. 1238-1298), and the Italians as “Tartaglia's Triangle,” after 
the Italian algebraist Tartaglia, born Niccolo Fontana (1499-1557), who live a century 
before Pascal. In Western European mathematical literature it is called Pascal's triangle 
after the Traité du triangle arithmétique (1655) by Blaise Pascal, in which several results 
then known about the triangle were used to solve problems in probability theory. 
Interesting historical anecdotes regarding the combinatoric aspects of these numbers is 
given in Section 7.2.1.7 of the classic The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth 
(2004). 
 
Here we use the name Mount Meru since it has also had fairly wide currency in the 
English literature (see, e.g. McClain, 1976), and because it was used by Ervin Wilson 
whose work will be discussed here. Wilson describes recurrence sequences that he calls 
Meru 1 through 9.

A Multiplicative Mount Meru and a Multiplicative Sequence of Notes 
 
The problem of why Indian musicologists speak of a sequence of 3, 7, and 22 notes has 
been of long-standing interest (see, e.g., Clough et al, 1993; Kak, 2003). Although 
Clough et al (1993) present it as the problem of the passage from a chromatic universe of 
22 divisions to a “diatonic” set of seven degrees, there is no textual evidence in support 
of a prior conception of 22 micronotes. For example, Bharata Muni’s Nātya Śāstra 
speaks both of the 7 and the 22 divisions. 
 
We propose that a combinatoric consideration may have been behind the choice. Given 
that the study of poetic meters was an important part of education at that time, it is likely 
that variants of Mount Meru were examined. An interesting variant on the standard 
Mount Meru is a Multiplicative Meru where each descendent number is a product of the 
numbers above it plus one, with the further condition that when the multiplicands are 
both 0, the product remains 0. One can see in Figure 3 that all other numbers are 0s, and 
therefore the product at the edges is (0 × 1 + 1 = 1).

                  1   3   3   1             
 
                1   4   10  4   1           
 
              1   5   41   41  5   1         
 
            1   6  206 1682 206  6   1   
 
 

Figure 3: A Multiplicative Mount Meru     

An interesting sequence emerging from a similar multiplicative logic is M(n+1)= M(n) × 
M(n-1) + 1, which gives us: 

  

 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 22, 155, 3411, 528706, …. 

 
We propose that the occurrence of the numbers 3, 7, and 22, in this series is not a 
coincidence and the above construction was behind the identification of the 22 microntes 
in the Indian theory of music. The original number is taken to be 3 basic notes, that 

 

5

become the standard 7 notes and the 22 micronotes (śruti). Although there is no way to 
confirm that this was indeed the case, it appears to be plausible. 
 
 
 
 
General Recurrence Sequences 
 
In general, we can write the sequence using the linear recurrence relation: 
 

F(n) = ∑K

i=1 a(i)  F(n-i)

xK – a(1) xK-1 – a(2)xK-2-… a(K) =  0 

 
where a(i) values represent suitable constants. The General Ratio, in this case, will be the 
solution to the algebraic equation: 
 
 
 
It is obvious that any number of Ratios can be obtained by a proper choice of K and a(i)s.  
 
Less radical variants of Mount Meru and that of Fibonacci sequences may also be 
conceived. For example, Wilson’s variations of Fibonacci sequences (Wilson 1993, 
2001), are obtained by using different slopes of Mount Meru by combining two earlier 
terms in the sequence. They were named by him as Meru 1 through Meru 9. 
 
Wilson’s Meru 1 through Meru 9 
 

1.  Meru 1:  An = An-1  + An-2  with limiting ratio 1.618033.. (golden mean) 
2.  Meru 2: Bn = Bn-1 + Bn-3  with limiting ratio 1.465571.. 
3.  Meru 3: Cn = Cn-2  + Cn-3  with limiting ratio 1.324717.. 
4.  Meru 4: Dn = Dn-1 + Dn-4  with limiting ratio 1.380277.. 
5.  Meru 5: En = En-3  + En-4  with limiting ratio 1.220744.. 
6.  Meru 6: Fn = Fn-1  + Fn-5  with limiting ratio the same as Meru 3. 
7.  Meru 7: Gn = Gn-2  + Gn-5  with limiting ratio 1.236505.. 
8.  Meru 8: Hn = Hn-3  + Hn-5  with limiting ratio 1.193859.. 
9.  Meru 9:  In = In-4  + In-5   with limiting  ratio 1.167303.. 

 
The explicit use of these exotic sequences to create musical scales has been presented by 
the composer Warren Burt (2002). He has presented what he calls Wilson Installations, 
which are a set of three live solo electronic music performances “that deal with the 
notions of extended tuning systems, the relation of tuning to timbre and spatiality of 
sound, and the concentration of attention for extended time periods.” 
 
One may also generalize the Mount Meru structure. In Figure 4 we show a triplicate 
Mount Meru, for which one of the characteristic sequences would be F(n+1) = F(n) + 
F(n-1) + F(n-2, that is, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44, 81, …

Structural Considerations 
 
If a golden rectangle is drawn and a square is removed, the remaining rectangle is also a 
golden rectangle (Figure 5a). Continuing this process and drawing circular arcs, the curve 
formed approximates the logarithmic spiral, which is a form found in nature (Figure 5b).  
These numbers are encountered in many plants in the arrangement of leaves around their 
stems, as well as in pine cones, seed head packing, and flower petals for optimality 
conditions. 
 
Since physical reasons underlie this occurrence of the golden mean in nature, it is 
tempting to look at the structural basis of why it is a pleasing proportion cognitively, 
although we must remember it is not the only one.  
 
 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

  Figure 5: The Fibonacci sequence in (a) two dimensions and (b) as a spiral 
 
 
If the stimulation inside the brain corresponding to an input spreads through a spiral 
function, then the pleasantness of the golden mean would be clear. On the other hand, 
neurophysiological structures are not quite two-dimensional, and therefore, there would 
be a component of the spiral that would go into the third dimension, providing a 
departure from the “normative” golden mean to many other similar numbers, such as 
Meru 2 through 9 of Wilson, or other more general numbers. The fact that inanimate, 

 

7

x3 = x + 1 

living and cognitive systems show similar behaviour is a consequence of pervasive 
recursionism (Kak, 2004). 
 
 
Concluding Remarks 
 
This note has reviewed some variants of Fibonacci sequences that are of interest to 
musicologists. The Fibonacci sequence corresponds to a spreading function that is two-
dimensional:  
 
 
x2 = x + 1 
 
 
that is, with the next step as the square of the previous one (Figure 4a). By analogy, in a 
purely three-dimensional spreading function, the operative formula should be: 
 
  
 
which corresponds to the recurrence relation of Meru 3. This may be written, 
alternatively, as the solution of the balanced-looking equation Ψ = 1/[(Ψ – 1) (Ψ + 1)]. 
Since the neurophysiological cognitive structures do not have a symmetry across all the 
three dimensions (there is also variation across individuals),  proportions intermediate to 
the golden mean and Meru 3 (1.324717…) would also be aesthetically pleasing, 
especially in traditions which are contemplative, as in Asia.  
 
Coming back to the question of aesthetic universals that Maceda posed, I agree with him 
that it is most likely that they do not exist. It is cultural authority and tradition that creates 
them, although they may be shaped by “universals” associated with our cognitive 
systems.

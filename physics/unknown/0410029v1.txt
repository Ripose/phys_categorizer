Abstract:  This  letter  presents  a  comparison  of  exact  probability  density  function  with  the 

Gaussian  noise  approximation  in  optically  pre-amplified  DPSK  receivers  with  optical 

Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  demodulation  (MZI)  and  balanced  detection,  including  the 

impact  of  phase  noise.  It  is  found  that  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  significantly 

over-estimates ASE-ASE beat noise in DPSK receivers with balanced detection particularly 

when phase noise is negligible, compared to IM/DD receivers, ASE- amplified spontaneous 

emission. However, the Gaussian noise approximation is still applicable for DPSK receivers 

with balanced detection and the measured 3-dB advantage is predicted by the Gaussian noise 

distribution. 

Indexing  Terms:  Optical  fiber  communication,  optical  receiver,  optical  modulation,

I. Introduction 

Differential  phase  shift  keying  (DPSK)  with  optical  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  (MZI) 

demodulation  and  balanced  detection  has  gained  much  attention  since  several  advantages 

over  intensity  modulation  and  direct  detection  (IM/DD)  have  been  discovered  [1-5]. 

Particularly, the requirement of optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) is reduced by 3 dB, or 

the  transmission  distance  is  doubled  [1-5]  for  the  same  system  performance  by  using 

DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  (DPSK/MZI-BD),  compared  to  DPSK/MZI 

receivers  with  single-port  detection  (DPSK/MZI-SD)  or  IM/DD  (DPSK/MZI-SD  is 

equivalent to IM/DD if both optically pre-amplified). There has been much discussion on how 

to  explain  the  3-dB  advantage  origin  theoretically [6-9].  One  origin  is  attributed  to  the  fact 

that the Gaussian noise approximation is not adequate for DPSK/MZI-BD [6-8] and the other 

is given by the fact that the calculation method of bit error ratio (BER) is different from the 

conventional method [9]. In optically pre-amplified DPSK/MZI receivers, there mainly exist 

two  noise  contributions:  amplified  spontaneous  emission  (ASE)  noise,  which  is  added  into 

the signal linearly (linearly additive ASE noise); and phase noise, which  mainly consists of 

two parts: one part induced by ASE orthogonal component (linear phase noise), and the other 

part  induced  by  nonlinear  Kerr  interaction  between  ASE  noise  and  signal  (nonlinear  phase 

noise) [10-12]. If only considering the linearly additive ASE noise, i.e. signal-ASE beat noise 

and  ASE-ASE  beat  noise,  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  cannot  predict  the  3-dB 

advantage [6-9] by using the definition of

x   are  the  Gaussian  probability  density  functions  (pdf’s)  of  bits  “1”  and  “0”,  and 

thI   is the optimal decision threshold. In [6-8], the 3-dB advantage was predicted by using the 

exact  pdf’s  based  on  the  above  BER.  However,  we  will  show  that  the  3-dB  advantage 

predicted in [6-8] is not the measured 3-dB in [2-5]. It was shown that the noise statistics of 

differential  phase  noise  (or  phase  noise  difference)  is  well  approximated  by  the  Gaussian 

distribution [11-12]. If the effects of linearly additive ASE noise and differential phase noise 

both are taken into account, it was reported that inner tails of the pdf’s of bits “1” and “0” are 

moved  up  due  to  the  phase  noise,  and  the  3-dB  advantage  finally  is  vanished  if  the  phase

noise is increased to some extent [13].   

 

 

 

 

 

It  was  well  established  that  the  linearly  additive  ASE  noise  statistic  (i.e.  signal-ASE  beat 

noise  and  ASE-ASE  beat  noise)  follows  the  Chi-square  distribution  in  IM/DD  [14-15]. 

However,  because  the  signal-ASE  beat  noise  is  usually  dominating  and  has  the  Gaussian 

distribution,  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  has  been  widely  used  and  provides  a  fairly 

good  estimation  of  BER  [14-16].  The  only  difference  of  between  DPSK/MZI  and  IM/DD 

receivers is that an optical MZI is inserted before optical photodiodes, and the optical MZI is 

a  special  optical  filter.  Hence,  the  signal  detection  and  ASE  processing  in  DPSK/MZI 

receivers  are  almost  the  same  as  in  IM/DD  receivers.  We  could  expect  that  there  is  no  big 

difference  in  noise  statistics  between  DPSK/MZI  and  IM/DD  receivers  except  that 

DPSK/MZI  receivers  are  not  immune  to  phase  noise.  In  this  letter,  the  exact  pdf’s  of  noise 

statistics  in  DPSK/MZI-BD  are  investigated  including  the  impact  of  phase  noise.  The 

applicability of the Gaussian noise approximation for DPSK/MZI-BD is discussed. 

II. Theory 

DPSK/MZI-BD  consists  of  the  following  components  in  series;  an  optical  pre-amplifier,  an 

optical filter, an ideal optical MZI demodulator, balanced photodiodes and an electrical filter. 

For the ideal DPSK i.e. with no phase error, when bit “1” is received the signal completely 

presents at the constructive port, and only ASE noise will appear at the destructive port; and 

vice versa for bit “0””. For DPSK-BD with phase error, the currents for bits “1” and “0” are 

given approximately by

Compared to IM/DD, one difference is that there is an additional term in (6), i.e. ASE-ASE 

beat  noise  from  the  destructive  port  for  bit”1”  and  constructive  port  for  bit  “0”.  Fig.1(a) 

depicts  the  exact  pdf’s  (solid)  calculated  by  (4).  The  Gaussian  approximation  with  the

  is also displayed for comparison (dashed). 

It  is  shown  that  the  exact  pdf’s  are  not  symmetrical  to  the  current  mean;  and  the  Gaussian 

approximation over-estimates the inner tails of the pdf’s and thus BER accordingly. However, 

if the signal-ASE beat noise is only considered in (6) i.e. ignoring the last two terms in (6), 

the  pdf’s  given  by  (4)  become  the  Gaussian  distribution  [14-15],  the  same  as  bit  “1”  in 

IM/DD.  Thus,  the  asymmetry  of  the  exact  pdf’s  is  totally  attributed  to  the  ASE-ASE  beat 

noise.  Therefore,  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  only  over-estimates  the  ASE-ASE  beat 

noise  in  DPSK/MZI-BD,  similar  to  IM/DD.  The  following  parameters  have  been  used  in 

Fig.1(a); bit rate of 43 Gb/s, optical pre-amplifier with gain of 35 dB and noise figure of 5 dB, 

optical  noise  bandwidth  of 

oB =100  GHz;  electrical  bandwidth  of 

eB =33  GHz,  R=1,  and 

optical signal power of -30 dBm. The noise figure of 5 dB is used for enhancing ASE-ASE 

beat noise.   

Now  we  consider  the  case  of  phase  noise  included.  Fig.1(b)  shows  the  exact  pdf’s  (solid) 

calculated  by  (5)  for  the  case  of  ∆Φ   having  a  standard  deviation  of  0.25  radians.  The 

calculated  pdf’s  are  in  good  agreement  in  shape  with  the  measured  [13].  For  comparison,

shown  in  Fig.1(b)  (dashed).  For  this  case,  the  over-estimation  of  inner  tails  of  the  pdf’s  is 

significantly  reduced  by  the  Gaussian  approximation.  In  (1)  if  only  considering  the  phase 

noise, we have

Comparison of (7) and (8) has shown that the balanced detection has the same performance 

as  the  single-port  detection  if  the  phase  noise  is  only  considered,  which  proves  the 

observation  in  [13],  of  which  the  3-dB  advantage  is  vanished  when  the  phase  noise  is 

increased to some extent. 

IV. Discussion of Gaussian noise approximation 

For the case of no phase noise, the Gaussian noise approximation is the worst case, the largest 

over-estimation of the inner pdf tails induced. Therefore, DPSK/MZI-BD for the case of no 

phase noise is only discussed here. In order to understand the impact of the Gaussian noise 

approximation, we calculate the cumulative probability (CP) by two methods.

Fig.2 shows that the ~3-dB advantage or improvement is predicted based on the exact pdf’s 

by  comparing  DPSK/MZI-BD  with  IM/DD,  rather 

than  ~1  dB  by  the  Gaussian 

approximation. Since the exact pdf’s of bits “1” and “0” become Gaussian if the ASE-ASE 

beat noise is ignored (see (6)), the CP for both DPSK/MZI-BD and IM/DD become the same 

(details also  in  [9])  (CP  almost  overlapped  with  the  dashed  curve  in  Fig.2). Therefore,  the 

~3-dB advantage in Fig.2 is attributed to the ASE-ASE beat noise. We have verified that the 

advantage  is  still  kept  ~3  dB  for 

oB   of  down  to 

o bB T ≈

0.7

  (without  considering  signal

distortion  by  filtering)  and  is  decreased  with  the  increase  of 

oB .  This  is  in  excellent 

agreement with in [6-8] (In [6-8], the ~3-dB advantage is quickly vanished with the increase 

of 

B B .  This  suggests  that  the  ~3-dB  advantage  is  induced  by  ASE-ASE  beat  noise 

o

e

because the  signal-ASE beat noise is independent of 

oB ). Because  the ~3-dB advantage  in 

Fig.2 is due to ASE-ASE beat noise, this ~3-dB advantage cannot be used for doubling the 

transmission  distance  or  reducing  the  OSNR  requirement  of  3-dB.  In  other  words,  the 

performance of DPSK/MZI-BD and IM/DD ultimately becomes identical if CP by method #1 

is BER. On the other hand, the measured advantage is typically in the range of 3-4 dB [1-5], 

and  thus  the  measured  is  beyond  the  predicted.  The  measured  3-dB  advantage  is  also 

interpreted  by  signal  constellation  [1].  In  Fig.3,  we  plot  the  signal  constellations  for  the 

single-port  and  balanced  detections.  The  distance  of  bits  “1”  and  “0”  electric  fields  in 

DPSK/MZI-SD is assumed  x , and then the distance is 

2x   in DPSK/MZI-BD. Thus, the 

inherent 3-dB advantage in intensity is obtained by use of DPSK/MZI-BD. In other words, 

the  3-dB  advantage  or  improvement  is  directly  induced  by  the  signal  itself. Physically,  the 

inherent 3-dB advantage can be explained as follows. In DPSK/MZI-SD or IM/DD (bit “0” 

always has zero decision current), if the decision current of bit “1” becomes zero due to some 

reasons, bits “1” and “0” are not distinguishable and thus errors occur; on the contrary, bits 

“1”  and  “0”  are  still  distinguishable  in  DPSK/MZI-BD  because  bits  “0”  has  non-zero 

decision  current.  Therefore,  the  ~3-dB  advantage  shown  in  Fig.2  is  not  measured  3-dB  in 

[1-5]. It is worth to emphasize that the ~3-dB advantage in Fig.2 from the partial cancellation 

of  ASE-ASE  beat  noise  between  the  two  ports  is  only  obtained  theoretically  by  ideally 

balanced detection.

Applicability…. 

ASE-ASE  beat  noise  for  our  setting).  Thus,  DPSK/MZI-BD  ultimately  outperforms 

DPSK/MZI-SD  or  IM/DD  by  exact  3  dB.  Because  this  3-dB  advantage  is  not  due  to 

ASE-ASE beat noise and from the signal itself, the convergence of method #2 with the signal 

constellation  is  obtained.  Therefore,  the  calculated  CP  by  method  #2  is  BER  for 

DPSK/MZI-BD, and the physical explanation of BER by method #2 will be given elsewhere.   

V. Conclusions 

We  have  compared 

the  exact  pdf’s  of  noise  statistics 

in  optically  pre-amplified 

DPSK/MZI-BD  including  phase  noise  with  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation.  It  is  shown 

that  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  only  induces  a  larger  over-estimation  of  ASE-ASE 

beat noise in DPSK/MZI-BD than in IM/DD. The partial cancellation of ASE-ASE beat noise 

by  ideally  balanced  detection  can  induce  ~3-dB  improvement  of  receiver  sensitivity, 

predicted with the exact pdf’s, rather than ~1 dB with the Gaussian approximation. However, 

we  have  found  that  this  ~3-dB  improvement  is  not  experimentally  measured  3-dB.  The 

measured  3-dB  advantage  is  predicted  by  the  Gaussian  approximation  if  the  correct  BER 

calculation is used (i.e. method #2). Consequently, the Gaussian noise approximation is still 

applicable  for  DPSK/MZI-BD  as  in  IM/DD.  Besides,  we  have  shown  that  DPSK/MZI-BD 

has  the  same  upper  limit  of  phase  noise  as  DPSK/MZI-SD.  Thus,  it  is  confirmed  that  the 

3-dB advantage will be vanished if the phase noise is increased to the upper limit.

ABSTRACT:  We present  the  results  of over 90 tight-binding molecular-dynamics simulations

of collisions between three- and five-atom silicon clusters, at  a system  temperature  of  2000K.

Much the most likely  products  are found to  be two  ‘magic’ four-atom clusters.  We show  that

previous studies, which focused on the equilibrium binding energies of clusters of different sizes,

are of limited relevance,  and  introduce  a  new  effective  binding  energy  which  incorporates  the

highly  anharmonic  dynamics  of  the  clusters.    The  inclusion  of  dynamics  enhances  the  magic

nature of both Si4 and Si6 and destroys that of Si7.

In recent years  much work  has been done on developing the  understanding  of  the  structure  of

atomic clusters and their transition  to  the  structure  of  a  bulk  solid  with  increasing  size.    For

silicon in particular, the existence of magic number clusters, consisting of 4, 6 and 10 atoms,  has

been the  subject  of  much  study  using  both  ab  initio  and  tight-binding  (TB)  methods  [1,2,3].

These  magic  numbers  correspond  to  especially  abundant  cluster  sizes  arising  during  the

production process, where laser evaporation of a solid silicon surface produces  a plasma which

is then swept away in a stream of inert gas.  As  this  plasma cools, the  clusters undergo a series

of collisions as the system attains  dynamic equilibrium.  It  is found [4] that  the  magic numbers

indicated by the mass spectrum of the clusters so produced are independent of the  details of the

method  of  production,  depending  only  on  the  fact  that  the  clusters  have  reached  dynamic

equilibrium.

1

Previous work [1,2,3,5] has attempted  to  explain the  existence of these  magic numbers through

the  study  of  the  equilibrium  structures  of  the  clusters.  However,  during  their  formation  the

clusters are at  a high temperature  and are consequently  exploring geometrical configurations far

from the potential-energy minimum.  The relevance of the  minimum energy is therefore unclear.

The aim of this work is to simulate a large number of collisions, analyzing the results  in terms  of

the dynamics of the reactants, intermediate clusters and products,  rather than  simply  the  statics

of cluster equilibrium.

Use  of  a  tight-binding  (TB)  scheme  makes  such  simulations  computationally  feasible  whilst

incorporating the quantum-mechanical description of the sp directional bonding in silicon that  is

essential for reproducing the  correct cluster structures.   The  TB  scheme used here was  devised

by Goodwin et al. [6] to give a good representation of a large database of the  volume-dependent

total energy of solid silicon in various structures, ensuring accuracy over a wide range of bonding

configurations.    The  energy  and  forces  obtained  from  the  TB  model  were  used  in  a  classical

molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation [7] of the atomic motion.

Since all previous  work  has  concentrated  on  the  equilibrium  structures  of  the  Si  clusters,  we

address these first.  Hence, we used our TB MD, to perform simulated annealing for clusters of 2

to 8 atoms in order to identify their minimum-energy structures.  All of the  structures  identified

in this way were found to agree with previous results using this scheme [6] except for the case of

Si5.    For  this  cluster  we  find  a  rather  asymmetric,  face-capped  planar  rhombus  form  for  the

minimum energy structure,  in agreement with  the  results  of Laasonen and  Nieminen  [5].    It  is

significant that  the  search  for  the  equilibrium  configuration  of  Si8  was  quite  difficult,  it  being

2

found necessary to reduce the time step  to  one twentieth  of the  2.42 ·

 10-4 ps  used during the

cooling of all of the  other  clusters.  This  indicates  that  the  Si8  minimum  energy  structure  is  a

narrow and rather inaccessible valley in the potential energy surface of the cluster.

Although  the  TB  scheme  used  here  achieves  better  agreement  with  ab  initio  results  for  the

equilibrium structures  of the  clusters than  other  TB  schemes [1,2]  (typically  bond  lengths  are

within  10%  of  ab  initio  values),  the  associated  binding  energies  per  atom  were  consistently

overestimated by (1.03 –

 0.07) eV.  This may be due in part  to  the  fact that  Goodwin et al. [6]

fitted the scheme to the results of an ab initio density-functional-theory  calculation in the  local-

density approximation (LDA), since calculations of this type overestimate the  cohesive energies

of bulk silicon and molecules.  However, as the  overbinding is virtually independent  of  cluster

size (and thus of the different types of bonding present in the different structures),  it  is unlikely

to have had a significant effect on the simulated dynamics and the outcomes of the  collisions.  It

should be noted that these errors are of the  same order of magnitude as would be obtained from

an ab initio LDA calculation.

The results  of the  simulated annealing indicated that  the  equilibrium structure  of the  Si4 cluster

was considerably more stable than either the  3 or 5 atom forms.  By  simulating the  collision of

Si3 with Si5, we aim to  investigate the  effects, if any,  of this  property  of Si4 on the  outcome of

the cluster-cluster collision process.  The collisions were carried out for impact parameters, b, of

0 to 5.82 Å with an initial system temperature of approximately 2000K and were followed for a

time corresponding to 7.26 ps. Although locating the minimum energy structure of Si8 required a

much reduced time step, its highly localized nature means that  it  will not  significantly affect the

dynamics during the collisions simulated here [8].  It  is therefore acceptable to  use the  standard

3

time step of  4.84 ·

 10-4 ps.   Prior to  a collision, the  clusters were separately  heated to  2000K

and assigned appropriate centre-of-mass velocities.  In order that  the  results  may  be considered

as an average over the  many  possible  relative orientations of  the  colliding  clusters,  we  rotated

each cluster through three random angles about its internal axes before every collision.

A  summary of the  results  of all of  the  collisions  simulated  is  given  in  Table  I.    For  all  cases

where the clusters came into contact a reaction resulted, such as the  transfer of a single atom to

produce Si4 + Si4.  Although twelve simulations were performed for each impact  parameter, the

clusters failed to make contact on three occasions in simulations with  the  largest value of b and

thus did not react.  The eight reactions that produced Si3 + Si5 all involved significant rebonding.

The  results  in Table  I  clearly  show  the  dominance  of  the  Si4  +  Si4  reaction  product  in  these

collisions, with this configuration being the result in almost 70% of the  reactive collisions.  20%

of the  reactions produced a single Si8 cluster that  did not  fragment,  making  this  the  next  most

abundant product.  It is interesting to note that the loss of a single atom by the  highly mobile Si8

cluster formed during the collisions was never observed.

We  emphasize  the  irrelevance  of  the  equilibrium  potential  energy  values  of  the  clusters  in

determining the outcomes of these collision reactions.  As  an alternative, we have calculated the

effective  binding  energies  (EBEs)  of  the  clusters  under  the  conditions  simulated  here.    The

effective binding energy was defined to be - 1  times the  minimum value of potential  energy that

would  exist  if  the  potential-energy  surface  for  the  actual  mean  potential  energy  and  kinetic

energy  were  harmonic  about  its  minimum  (see  Figure  1).    Since,  for  a  harmonic  oscillator,

, (where

from the  total  kinetic  energy  by  using  the  equipartition  theorem,  this  assumption  enables  an

where N is the number of atoms in the cluster.  All of the time averaged values except that for Si7

were obtained from the  results  of actual collision runs.   Since Si7 was  never  produced  in  these

collisions,  its  effective  binding  energy  was  obtained  by  heating  an  example  to  approximately

4000K (typical of the temperature attained by Si8 during a reaction) and then  letting it  evolve in

isolation.  Since a cluster’s temperature  determines the  extent to  which  it  explores  what  is,  in

reality, an anharmonic potential  energy surface, the  appropriate  EBE to  characterize its  motion

will also be a function of temperature.  Therefore, because the temperature of the reacting Si3 and

Si5 clusters tended to  differ from the  temperatures  of such clusters produced during a reaction,

two values for the EBEs of these clusters have been calculated.

The resulting EBEs differed significantly from the corresponding equilibrium values in a number

of ways.   For  instance, the  EBEs of both  Si7 and Si8 are considerably less than  the  equilibrium

values,  demonstrating  the  inaccessibility  of  their  equilibrium  structures  in  the  dynamics

simulated here.  In contrast,  for Si4, the  effective binding energy is greater than  the  equilibrium

binding energy, indicating a flattening, rather than  a steepening, of the  potential-energy  surface

near its minimum.

The energy changes associated with different reaction outcomes may be estimated by subtracting

the binding energies of the reacting Si3 and Si5 clusters from those of the products.  The estimates

obtained with both the equilibrium and effective values for the cluster binding energies predict Si8

to be the most favourable product, followed by Si4 + Si4.  However, the difference between these

two products is much less  in the  EBE estimate (1.3 eV compared with  the  equilibrium value of

3.9 eV).  In  general,  the  estimates  produced  using  the  EBE’s  give  predictions  in  much  closer

agreement  with  both  the  results  of  our  simulations  and  those  of  experiment  [4]  than  do  the

corresponding  equilibrium  estimates.    First,  use  of  the  effective  values  reduces  the  predicted

increase in binding energy associated with the production of Si + Si7 from 1.7 eV (the equilibrium

estimate) to - 0.9 eV.  This indicates that it is not  an energetically-favourable outcome; hence its

absence from Table I.  Second, they  also give the  correct ordering of the  remaining products  in

that  Si3 +  Si5  is  predicted  to  be  marginally  (0.1  eV)  more  favourable  than  Si2  +  Si6,  in  direct

contrast to the equilibrium values which predict that Si2 +  Si6 is the  more favourable of the  two

by 0.7 eV.  The fact that a product of Si8 is not as common as suggested by  this  simple estimate

is due to  the  fact  that  the  single  cluster  cannot  accommodate  all  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the

reaction.  Hence, it  becomes simply   a matter  of time  as  the  cluster  explores  its  configuration

space before it will fragment.

Another  way  of comparing the  equilibrium  and  effective  binding  energies  is  to  plot  them  per

atom as a function of cluster size (Fig. 2).  The additional stability of the points at N=4 and N=6,

in  comparison  to  what  would  be  expected  from  a  linear  combination  of  neighbouring  values,

indicates the magic status of Si4 and Si6.  In contrast, the corresponding curve for the  equilibrium

values has no local maximum at  N=6, predicting  instead  that  Si7  is  magic.    These  features  are

emphasized in the  plot  of cluster fragmentation energy (defined as the  binding energy of an N-

atom cluster less that of the  N- 1-atom cluster) also shown  in Figure 2.  The  peaks  at  N=4 and

N=6 in the curve obtained with the effective values show the enhanced stability of these  clusters

6

under the dynamic conditions simulated here.  The  absence of a peak  for the  Si7 cluster reflects

the removal of its magic nature.

As  a typical  example of the  type  of the  behaviour observed during  the  collision  processes  we

shall briefly discuss a particular collision with  an impact  parameter  of  5.82  Å.    The  variation

with time of the system  potential  energy and mean coordination number during this  collision is

shown in Figure 3.  (The  definition of coordination for the  latter  quantity  included a linear cut-

off, chosen to  maintain  a  nearest-neighbour  character  and  thus  a  coordination  number  of  4  in

diamond-structure bulk silicon.)  The time of first contact of the clusters is indicated by an arrow

in the figure and corresponds to the sharp drop in PE as the  clusters begin to  mix.  It  should be

noted however, that the new Si8 cluster never attains its minimum energy of - 37.2  eV during the

mixing phase,  again emphasising the  fact that  its  equilibrium  structure  is  not  significant  under

these conditions. At t=3.8 ps, the mean coordination number drops  briefly to  its  initial value as

the Si8 almost fragments into Si3 + Si5.  However, the  clusters recombine before finally splitting

(indicated by second arrow) as Si4 +  Si4 at  approximately  4.8 ps.   The  final potential  energy of

the system is considerably lower (by roughly 1.4 eV) than that of the reactants.

In conclusion, we have simulated over ninety  collisions of Si3 with  Si5 at  a system  temperature

of approximately 2000K.  Over 70% of the reactive collisions resulted in the production of Si4 +

Si4, whereas Si + Si7 was never produced.  The equilibrium binding energies and associated magic

numbers have been shown to be unsatisfactory in describing the  behaviour of the  clusters under

these  dynamic conditions.  We have introduced the  concept  of an effective binding energy that

incorporates the highly anharmonic dynamics of the  clusters.  The  magic numbers predicted by

these  effective binding energies are  in  agreement  with  both  the  results  of  our  simulations  and

7

experiment.  In particular,  Si4 and Si6 are both  shown  to  be magic whilst  the  prediction of the

equilibrium values that Si7 is magic is shown to be incorrect.  The energy changes predicted using

the  effective  binding  energies  also  account  (with  the  exception  of  Si8  which  is  unable  to

accommodate all of the energy of the  collision) for the  relative abundances of reaction products

observed in the simulations.

‘magic’.  The lower plot of the fragmentation energy, BE(N)- BE(N- 1), emphasizes the magic
status of the 4- and 6-atom clusters when the effective binding energies incorporating dynamic

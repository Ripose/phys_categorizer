1.  Introduction 

Einstein  s  hypothesis  of  photons  has  followed  the  Planck’s  quantum 

hypothesis. This hypothesis tells that the electromagnetic field is composed 

of particles-photons-with the energy-momentum fourvector 

Light  quantum  hypothesis  concerns  the  energy  of  a  monochromatic

(1.1) 

plane wave as well as the existence of a relativistic scalar   h. 

M.  Abraham  [1]  was  first  to  derive  for  the  special  case  of  circularly 

polarized  monochromatic  plane  wave  the  ratio  between  the  spin  angular 

momentum and the time average of the total energy of the plane wave in the 

classical description of electromagnetic waves. 

This  ratio  indicates  the  existence  of  a  scalar  constant  having  the 

dimension of angular momentum. One could infer that this ratio would be in 

full accordance with light quantum hypothesis if the scalar constant equals 

1/2π times

. h

F. Rohrlich [2] finds in accord with [1] that in certain special cases of plane 

waves the aforesaid ratio is given by

(1.3) 

 
where a, b,δ, k , ω are parameters of the plane wave. In connection with this 

formula Rohrlich says: “The classical result (4-188) can be combined with 

Max Planck s light quantum hypothesis of the year 1900. If  

ω= ηW

 where 

η is 1/2π times Planck’s constant  h, then right and left circularly polarized 

light  must  have  a  spin  angular  momentum  of   

∑ = h     and   

k

k−h , 

respectively.  The  quantum  field  theoretical  description  of  electromagnetic 

waves confirms this conclusion”.  

In  [1]  and  [2]  no  scalar  constant  of  the  free  electromagnetic  field  has 

been  determined  and  consequently  these  considerations  gave  a  partial 

insight  into  photon  from  the  view-point  of  classical  electromagnetic  field 

In  the  article  [3]  the  scalar  constant  of  the  free  electromagnetic  field 

and  its  consequences  have  been  analyzed.  In  this  article  we  show  that  the 

whole  concept  of  the  photon  is  potentially  present  in  the  conceptual 

framework of the classical electromagnetic field theory.

Since 

the

propagating in the direction defined by the unit vector  n   satisfy the relation  

                                                    

the  decomposition  (2.5-2.8)  can  be  in  Coulomb  gauge  defined  more 

specifically  in  terms  of  the  three-vectors

Due  to  (2.10-2.13)  the  components  of  the  electromagnetic  energy-

Since  the  quantity  θ  is  a  relativistic  scalar  this  result  is  essentially 

equal  to  the  Einstein's  hypothesis.  Therefore,  the  photon-like  particles  are 

possible  physical  objects  already  in  the  classical  electromagnetic  field 

theory. 

The  vectors 

1A ,

2A , n   form  right-hand  oriented  set  of  orthogonal 

vectors  with  right-circular  polarization  (as  seen  in  the  direction  of 

propagation). The state of spin is +1.

5.  Conclusion 

This  simple  analysis  shows  that  photon-like  particles  are  not  strange 

within  the  conceptual  framework  of  the  classical  electromagnetic  field 

theory.  Circular  polarized  waves  lead  to  photons.  Thus,  light  quantum 

hypothesis is not necessary.

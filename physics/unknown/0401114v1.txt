Abstract 

In the present study, a prototypical reaction in biochemistry involving a well-known bio-

molecule  called  imidazole  (C3H4N2)  and  its  known  affinity  towards  transition  metals 

(such as Co, Ni, Cu, Fe, etc.) has been used to illustrate and exemplify the use of ballistic 

conductors as probes for molecular reactions at the quantum level. Atomic point contacts 

of  transition  metal  Co  were  made  using  electro-deposition,  followed  by  their  reaction 

with imidazole in an aqueous solution. As the imidazole molecules covalently bond with 

the Co atoms, the quantized conductance of the nanocontact decreases, thus providing a 

quantum  probe  for  studying  molecular  reactions.  During  the  course  of  the  reaction, 

different  conductance  channels  within  the  nanocontact  become  unavailable  due  to 

covalent bonding of Co with imidazole, thereby also providing a means of studying the 

number of channels contributing to the total conductance in the nanocontact itself.

Classical  or  diffusive  electron  transport  is  characteristics  of  metallic  conductors  having 

physical dimensions that are large in comparison to the mean free path of the electrons. 

As the size of the conductor becomes comparable to or smaller than the mean free path, 

the transport enters the ballistic regime. In contrasts to the zigzag motion of the electrons 

in a diffusive conductor, ballistic transport is characterized by bullet-like motion through 

the  conductor  devoid  of  any  scattering  events.  Sharvin  has  derived  the  resistance  of  a 

ballistic conductor using the semi-classical approach;1 see also Ref. [2] for an equivalent 

treatment by Wexler who used a model analogous to effusion of gases across a pinhole 

first  studied  by  Knudsen.3  In  metals,  when  the  ballistic  conductor  is  made  of  a  single 

atom  or  at  most  a  few  atoms,  its  size  becomes  comparable  to  the  Fermi  wavelength 

(typically 

≤

0.5  nm  in  metals).  Such  an  atomic  point  contact  may  be  viewed  as  a 

‘waveguide’ for the electrons and the classical picture of electron transport is replaced by 

Landauer’s  seminal  concept  of  conduction  as  a  transmission  probability  for  the 

propagating  electron  waves  across  the  waveguide.

4  The  transverse  confinement  of  the 

electron  wave  functions  quantizes  the  energy  levels  within  such  a  nanocontact  to  form 

bands  or  ‘channels’,  with  each  channel  contributing  to  conductance  in  discrete  units  of

respectively. Values of  T  intermediate between 0 and 1 reflect a partially open channel,

which  among  other  factors  also  depend  on  the  geometry  of  the  nanocontact.6  Ideally, 

when the channels are fully open, the conductance changes in a stepwise fashion during 

the  growth  of  the  nanocontact,  with  step  height  equal  to  1

.  However,  in  case  of 

oG

ferromagnetic materials, the spin degeneracy can be lifted (by making the nanocontacts in 

the  presence  of  an  applied  magnetic  field),  in  which  case  the  stepwise  change  in 

conductance occurs in units of

Previously, the above described principles of ballistic conductance have been used for the 

detection of different molecules in a solution (a chemical sensor) and towards the goal of 

making  molecular  electronics.9-10  In  the  present  study,  ballistic  conductors  are  used  as 

probes for molecular synthesis at the quantum level, whereby the change in conductance 

due to the formation of a transition metal-complex on the surface of a ballistic conductor 

is studied. Specifically, a widespread reaction in biochemistry involves the reaction of a 

bio-molecule called imidazole (C3H4N2) with a transition metal (TM) such as Co, Ni, Fe, 

Cu,  etc.  to  form  transition  a  metal  complex  TM(C3H4N2).  Imidazole  is  an  important 

heterocyclic bio-molecule and is also part of an amino acid called Histadine.11 Imidazole 

often plays a key role in site activity of proteins and enzymes. Due to its affinity to form 

transition metals complex, it is also widely used to displace peptides bound to a column 

of transition metal ligands.12-13 In the present study, the stepwise (or quantized) change in 

conductance  of  a  Co  nanoconductor  was  studied  during  the  course  of  its  reaction  with 

imidazole molecules to form the metal complex Co(C3H4N2); other transition metals react 

similarly with imidazole.

The  Co  nanocontacts  were  electro-deposited  between  microfabricated  Co  electrodes 

made by standard photolithographic processing on oxidized silicon wafers. As shown in 

Fig.  1(a),  the  electrodes  had  a  gap  of  50-300  nm,  and  were  2-3  µm  thick.  This  was 

followed  by  room  temperature  electro-deposition  of  Co  between  the  electrodes  using  a 

cobalt  sulfamate  solution  (solution  pH  was  3.3).  The  deposition  voltage  was  typically 

between 0.7 to 1 V. 

Control  Over  Contact  Size:  Recently  Boussaad  and  Tao  have  described  a  simple  and 

elegant self-terminating electro-deposition technique to make nanocontact and nano-gaps 

of  controlled  dimensions.16  Their  technique  allows  stable  atomic  contacts  to  be  made 

repeatedly.  This  method  has  been  previously  used  by  the  authors  to  make  Ni  and  Co 

nanocontacts,8,17  and  was  used  to  make  the  nanocontacts  in  the  present  study.  The 

experimental layout of the self-terminating electrochemical method is shown in Fig. 1(b), 

which shows an external resistor 

 connected in series with the electrochemical cell; 

extR

extR

 is set to a value that is less than the quantum resistance 

1

 of 12900 Ω, and was 

oG

typically 6500 to 12900 Ω in the present study. In Fig. 1(b), let the resistance between the 

anode  and  the  cathode  be 

,  (the  typical  cell  resistance  was  several  MΩ).  Therefore 

cellR

the  voltage  across  the  gap  between  the  anode  and  the  cathode  is  given  by

. As soon as the contact forms 

between  the  two  electrodes,  the  applied  voltage  across  the  electrodes  drops  and  gets 

established  across  the  external  resistor 

.  As  a  result  the  growth  of  the  nanocontact 

extR

slows considerably at which point the electro-deposition is stopped.

Figure 2 shows the conductance plots for five different nanocontacts, stabilized at values 

ranging from  1

oG

 to 

oG5

, made by using the above-described self-terminating method. 

In  Fig.  2,  the  stabilization  of  nanocontacts  at  different  conductance  plateaus  reflects  a 

change in the number of channels contributing to the total conductance, which, in turn, is 

a function of the contact diameter. As the nanocontact diameter decreases, the separation 

between  different  energy  bands  (or  channels)  increases  due  to  an  increase  in  the 

transverse  confinement  of  the  wave  functions  of  the  propagating  electron  waves.  This 

causes some of the channels to rise above the Fermi level, thereby becoming unavailable 

for conductance. In the limit of a single atom contact, only one channel may lie below the 

Fermi  level,  for  a  total  conductance  of  just  1

.  Figure  2  also  shows  that  the  Co 

nanocontacts not only exhibit integral values of 

 but also non-integral values of 1

and 

oG6.2

. A non-integral value of conductance reflects transmission probability

and 1, and this will be discussed later. The inset in Fig, 2 shows the conductance plot for 

a  Co  nanocontact  deposited  in  the  presence  of  an  applied  magnetic  field  (1800  Oe). 

Growth  of  a  nanocontact  in  the  presence  of  an  applied  magnetic  field  lifts  the  spin 

degeneracy  of  the  ferromagnetic  Co,  resulting  in  step-wise  change  in  conductance  in

Following  the  formation  of  a  stable  Co  nanocontact,  the  electrolyte  was  gradually 

replaced  by  de-ionized  ultra-filtered  (D.I.U.F.)  water  by  repeated  purging  of  the 

electrolytic  cell  with  D.I.U.F.  water.  This  was  followed  by  the  dissolution  of  a  small 

amount  of  imidazole  crystals  (in  µM/liter  quantities)  in  water.  The  dissolved  imidazole 

gradually  reacts  with  Co  atoms  within  the  nanocontact  as  well  as  the  Co  atoms  on  the 

surface  of  the  electrodes  to  form  the  metal  complex  Co(C3H4N2).  The  corresponding 

change in the nanocontact conductance as a function of time is shown in Fig. 3. The Co 

nanocontact in Fig. 3 had a stable conductance of 

oG6.2

 and was highly stable for over 

an hour prior to the start of the chemical reaction (a portion of the recorded conductance 

plot for this sample is shown in Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows that following the dissolution of 

the  imidazole  molecule  in  water,  the  conductance  decreases  in  four  stages,  marked  G

1 

through G4. Remarkably, each stage is characterized by an equal decrease in conductance 

of  roughly 

2

oG3

.  During  the  first  and  the  third  stage  (G1  and  G3),  the  decrease  in 

conductance is gradual, while the second and the fourth stage (G2 and G4) is marked by 

an abrupt decrease in conductance. The gradual decrease in the conductance (stages 1 and 

3) reflects covalent bonding of the imidazole molecules with the Co atoms in the vicinity 

of the nanocontact, as shown schematically in Fig. 3. Covalent bonding of the Co atoms 

with the imidazole molecules (imidazole molecules indicated by ‘Y’ in the schematic in 

Fig. 3) effectively reduces the cone angle at the nanocontact, and thus the transmission 

probability,6 as shown in the schematic in Fig. 3. The gradual change in conductance in 

stages 1 and 3 in Fig. 3 is thus indicative of contribution to the total conductance from Co 

atoms  that  are  adjacent  to  the  nanocontact.  Eventually,  by  probability,  an  imidazole 

molecule reacts with Co atom within the nanocontact. This localization of the electrons in 

Susan Z. Hua and Harsh D. Chopra

the nanocontact due to covalent bonding with the imidazole molecules is reflected by an 

abrupt lifting of the energy band above the Fermi level and a corresponding decrease in 

the  total  conductance.  Ultimately,  when  the  reactant  imidazole  molecule  blocks  all  the 

channels within the nanocontact, the conductance drops to zero.  

Finally,  the  occurrence  of  non-integral  contribution  to  the  total  conductance  from 

different channels has been previously shown (both experimentally and theoretically) in 

complex  metals  involving  p  and  d  electrons  (where  the  hybridization  of  the  s  electrons 

with  p  or  d  electrons  results  in  the  formation  of  a  large  number  of  channels).18-19  For 

example,  hybridization  of  the  s  and  p  electrons  in  aluminum  results  in  three  channels 

contributing 

1

oG3

 per channel.16 Present results show that in case of Co (where s and d 

electrons are present), more than one channels may contribute to the total conductance as 

seen from multiple steps in Fig. 3. Therefore, the present method also provides a means 

of studying the channels contributing to the overall conductance in a given metal system.

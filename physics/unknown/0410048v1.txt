Abstract.  Local Alfvén wave (LAW) resonances are excited in tokamak plasmas by an externally driven 
electromagnetic field, with low frequency ωA =cAk|| <<ωci, where cA is the Alfvén velocity. Recently, wave 
driven density fluctuations at the LAW resonance m=± 1, N=±2 with few kW power deposition and 4 MHz 
frequency were detected in TCABR (Bt =1.1T, q0 =1.1, n0=1.4-2.0⋅1019 m-3) using a fixed frequency (32.4GHz) 
O-mode reflectometer. Here, we show that combination of small power deposition in LAW resonances, swept 
by plasma density variation or scanned with generator frequencies, in combination with detection of the density 
fluctuations in the LAW resonances by reflectometry can serve as diagnostic tool for identification of the 
effective ion mass number Aef and q-profile in tokamaks. The idea is based on the simultaneous detection of the 
position of m=± 1 local AW resonances, which are excited by M/N=±1/±2 antenna modes, and m=0 generated 
by poloidal mode coupling effect in tokamaks. According to LAW dispersion, the m=0 resonance depends only 
on the effective ion mass number and does not depend on the q-profile. Then, using these data we can define q-
value at the position of m=± 1 L AW resonances. Using TAE coils with even toroidal modes (N=2, 4,..) and 
AW generator in the frequency band 0.6-1 MHz, an application of this method to Joint European Torus 
(Bt=2.3T, q0 =1-1.3, n0=5-7⋅1019 m-3) is demonstrated. 

 

The idea of strong resonant absorption of RF fields, which are excited at the local Alfvén 

wave (LAW) resonance in magnetically confined inhomogeneous plasmas, was based on a 

series of the theoretical works carried out at 70-80th (for example, [1-3]). LAW resonance 

excitation is defined by mode conversion of an externally driven RF field below the ion-

cyclotron frequency, ωci , into the kinetic or electrostatic Alfvén wave (shear AW) at the 

Alfvén resonance layer where the resonance density can be defined by the equation,

where m and N are toroidal and poloidal wave numbers, Bt is the toroidal magnetic field, q is

is the Alfvén velocity, Aef=(Ai ni+ Az nz) /ne 

is effective mass number, and ωci is the ion cyclotron resonance frequency. The continuous 

spectrum (1) of the LAW resonances is known as the Alfvén wave continuum. In the standard 

quasi cylindrical model for wave excitation in tokamak plasmas, the oscillating RF field is 

represented as a sum of helical harmonics exp[i(mθ+Νφ -ω t)]. These fields are excited in the 

plasma by an antenna current sheet, Jθ,φ (r,θ,φ,t)  = ΣM Jθ,φ (Μ,Ν) δ(r-b) exp[i(Mθ+Νφ -ω t)].  

The antenna spectra of Jθ,φ (Μ,Ν)  driven in tokamaks are very wide both for the toroidal and 

poloidal wave numbers; however, a few harmonics can satisfy the local AW resonance 

conditions (1). Due to toroidal effects, the poloidal wave numbers m in the plasma may be 

different from M that are excited by the antenna. Moreover, AW can also be excited in a 

plasma column as global Alfvén waves (GAW) [1-2], with wave fields corresponding to the 

discrete eigenfunctions of the proper boundary value problem. Toroidicity induced Alfven 

eigenmodes (TAE) as global waves can be excited at the position of bifurcation of the LAW 

resonances for different m and N numbers. The close position of GAW (∆ωGW <<ωth ) to the 

AW continuum minimum ωth, and its easy identification with magnetic probes together with 

the set of TAE resonances calculated from eq.(1) were explored as a diagnostic tool (named 

Magneto-Hydro-Dynamic diagnostics) for definition of the effective ion mass number Aef and 

q-profiles in a series of  tokamak experiments (for example, [4-6]). However, the strong 

dependence of ∆ωGW on toroidal wave number and current and density profile produced 

substantial difficulties in the interpretation of the experimental data. 

Recently,  using  a  fixed  frequency  (32.4GHz)  O-mode  reflectometer,  wave  driven 

density fluctuations at the local Alfvén wave (LAW) resonance m=± 1, N=2, with frequency  

f  =  4  MHz  and  relatively  small  power  deposition  of  30  kW,  were  detected  in  the  Tokamak 

Chauffage Alfvén Brésilien (TCABR) [7]. Here, based upon results of calculations carried out 

with the ALTOK code [8], we propose to use this effect in JET.  

 Plasma Model of TCABR and JET The calculations with ALTOK code have been carried 

out  assuming  circular,  in  TCABR,  and  D-shape  cross-section  (κ=1.43, δ=0.25)  in  JET.  To 

obtain good accuracy, 473x99 mesh points are used in the code calculations. Here, we analyze 
the  AW  absorption  in  TCABR  shot  No10668  [7,9]  (minor  radius  a=0.18m,  major  radius 

R0=0.615m, toroidal magnetic field B = 1.15T, Ip =78-80 kA, with safety factor in the center 
q(0)  =1-1.1,  line  averaged  plasma  density  n  =1.2-1.5×1019  m-3,  central  electron  and  ion 

temperatures  Te0=450  eV  and  Te0=150eV).  The  TCABR  antenna  module  has  two  groups  of 

RF  current  carrying  straps,  which  are  positioned  in  two  toroidal  cross-sections  separated 

toroidally by an angle about 22o, creating mainly the spectrum of the poloidal M=  ±1, ±2 and 

toroidal  N=±1,  ±2,  ±3…  modes.  Their  local  AW  resonances  are  strongly  separated  by 

choosing 4 MHz generator frequency. In JET calculations, we use shot #62209 as a reference; 

minor radius a=1.05m, major radius R0=2.85 m, toroidal magnetic field B = 2.3T, and for the 

following  basic  plasma  parameters:  current  Ip  =  2.4  MA  (safety  factor  q(0)  =1.2),  central 
plasma  density  n  =6×1019  m-3  (gas  deuterium),  central  electron  and  ion  temperatures  are  is 

4000 and 2500 eV, respectively. The generator frequency has been swept in the band f=0.6-

1.0 MHz. The antenna module is proposed to have two groups of RF current carrying straps. 

These groups are situated at two opposite toroidal positions creating mainly the spectrum of 

the poloidal M= 0, ±1,±2 and toroidal N=±2, ±4 modes. The plasma profiles used in the code 

calculations are quasi parabolic temperature profile T=T0(1-Ψ 0,9), density profile of TCABR 
n=n0(1-Ψ  0,7), rather flat profile of JET n=n0(1-Ψ  0,4), and current profile is j=j0(1-Ψ  0.9)  1.2, 

where Ψ  is the normalized poloidal magnetic flux.  

Identification  of  Local  AW  Resonance 

with  Reflectometry 

The 

density 

fluctuation  rise  in  the  LAW  position  can 

be  detected  by  a  reflectometer.  In  the 

simple  case,  the  amplitude  of  the  density 

fluctuations  is  proportional  to  the  parallel 

component  of  the  electric  field  and  to  the 

square root of the absorbed power density,

For 0.2kW/m3 of power density at the resonance surface rA=0.65(R-R0) (or about of 1kW of 
absorbed  power),  we  obtain  δn/ne≈1.10-4,  which  is  of  the  level  that  can  be  detected  by  a 

modern reflectometer. The sensitivity of the system may be improved with locked frequency 

detection  at  the  AW  frequency.  In  Fig.1,  we  show  the  time  traces  (70-100  ms)  of  the  loop 

voltage, line averaged density, toroidal current, and respective amplitude of 4MHz oscillating

diminishing  later  in  comparison  with  a  pure  ohmic  discharge  #  10669.  The  central  electron 

temperature is not increased during RF pulse, as indicated by the ECE signal.  In Fig.1c, we 

can observe the maxima of the amplitude of 4 MHz oscillating microwave phase that should 

be  interpreted  as  local  AW  resonances  for  m/N=  -1/-2  (Aef=1.17)  in  the  initial  stage  and 

superposition with m/N= -1/3 (Aef=1.1) in the final stage of the RF discharge # 10668.

The respective absorption profiles for 800

3b,c. The absorption in Fig.3c is produced 

in  the  GAW  resonance  of  the  m/N=-1/-2 

mode.  There  is  good  correlation  of  the 

local  AW  resonance  position  of  the  N=2

first

i.e., 

smaller  than  4cm  and  therefore 

offering  good  possibility  for

Conclusion.  

A  combination  of  sweeping 

AW  excitation  system  with  the 

ECE 

radiometry 

and 

the 

sweeping  of  the  reflectometer 

frequency  can  be  a  very 

powerful  diagnostic 

tool 

to 

localize 

the  AW 

power 

deposition, and to find effective mass number Aef and q-profiles in JET experiments.

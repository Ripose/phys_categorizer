The Effect of an Under-Dense Plasma Density Gradient on the Backstreaming

Ion Mechanism

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, California  94550 USA

George J. Caporaso

Abstract

The  space  charge  limited  emission  of  ions  from  a
target in the focus of  an intense relativistic electron beam
is  studied analytically for the  case  of  a  spatially  varying
target density profile.    In  particular,  the  emission  in  the
presence of  an  under-dense  plasma  shelf  in  contact  with
the  solid density target dramatically differs  from  the  case
of  an abrupt solid-vacuum boundary.   It  is  found  that  an
under-dense gradient scale length  several times  that  of  the
beam radius at  the  focus reduces the  emission  by  at  least
an  order  of  magnitude  over  that  to  be  expected  from  a
solid-vacuum boundary.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-resolution 

the
production  of  a  small  (» 1  mm  diameter)  spot  on  the
surface  of  a  Bremsstrahlung  converter 
target  by  a
relativistic  electron  beam  of  at  least  several  kiloamperes
[1].  A  mechanism  that  might  possibly  disrupt  the  focal
spot was proposed by D.  Welch [2].    Bombardment of  the
target by  a  high  power  electron  beam  would  lead  to  the
rapid formation of a surface plasma.    A  large axial electric
field  would  appear  at  the  surface  due  to 
the  charge
redistribution on the target arising from cancellation of  the
beam's radial electric field.    This  axial  field  would  expel
the ions  into  the  beam.    These backstreaming ions  would
acquire energies on  the  order of  the  space charge depressed
potential  of  the  beam  and  would  propagate  upstream  at
very high  speeds where they  would act as  an  electrostatic
focusing  lens.    The  focusing  due  to  these  moving  ions
would cause the  electron  beam  to  pinch  upstream  of  the
target and then rapidly diverge.  The result would be a spot
size that  would  rapidly  increase  in  time  at  the  converter
target.

In the case of  multiple  pulses  striking  the  same target
the  situation  might  be  modified  by  the  presence  of  a
plasma left  over from the  previous  pulses.    The  leading
edge of this plasma could be very tenuous.  

We  consider  the  effects  of  the  leading  edge  of  the
plasma, which is of lower density than  the  beam.    In  this
region the  plasma electrons will  be expelled and a  “bare”
ion  column  will  be  present.    We  assume  that  the  axial
electric field is low enough that we can neglect the motion
of these background ions.  We treat emission of ions  from
the  “critical surface” where  the  beam  density  is  equal  to
the  ion  density and impose  the  space-charge limited  flow
condition.

An  analytic  model  is  presented  for  a  "beer  can"
tube

geometry  in  which  a  close  fitting  conducting 
surrounds the beam right up to the target.

The  under-dense  plasma  is  modeled  as  having  an

exponentially varying density.

A  model of  backstreaming ion  emission  from a  sharp
boundary was given previously [3].  That  reference derived
an analytic solution for the emission of ions from a  planar
target for the same geometry and discussed the  subsequent
disruption  of  the  electron  beam  focal  spot.    This  paper
considers  the  more  general  case  of  a  target  that  has  a
tenuous plasma in the  vicinity  of  the  target.    The general
solution  is  found as  a function of  the  scale length  of  the
under-dense plasma density gradient.   In  the  limit  that  the
scale length  approaches zero the  solution  of  reference  [3]
is recovered.*

Because the  source of  the  electric  field  responsible  for
the  axial flow  of  ions  results  from  the  rapid  variation  in
radial  electric  field  due  to  the  neutralizing  effects  of  the
target,  it  is  of  interest  to  consider  the  effects  of  a
neutralizing background that varies from zero density up  to
the density of the beam.  By spreading out  the  region over
which the  radial electric field is  neutralized  it  is  expected
that the axial electric field and hence the  ion  emission  will
be reduced.

2 TARGET GEOMETRY AND MODEL

Consider the geometry shown in figure 1.    An  electron
beam  that  just  fits  inside  a  cylindrical  conducting  tube
impinges  normally  on  a  conducting  plane  (target).  We
assume that  the  beam  and  tube  have  radius  a  and  extend
infinitely in  the  z-direction.   We take the  target to  have a
diffuse  boundary  with  an  exponentially  varying  density.
We  consider  the  case  of  steady-state  space-charge-limited
emission of ions.

* The value of the neutralization fraction given in equation
[20] of reference [3] is in error.

We will  assume  that  the  target  surface  is  sufficiently
rich  in  ions  that  the  flow  will  be  space-charge-limited.
The  steady-state  emission  is  determined  by  Poisson's
equation for the electrostatic potential (in c.g.s. units)

Here  f(z)  represents  the  neutralization  fraction  of  the
beam’s space charge (r b) due to  a  static  ion  background.
i represents the charge density of the backstreaming ions.
The ion  velocity  can  be  found  from  the  conservation  of
energy (since the target and tube are grounded)

The  parameter  l  is  normalized  gradient  scale  length.
We would expect  to  recover  previous  results  for  a  sharp
boundary as l
0.  With  these  definitions  the  differential
equation for the dimensionless potential becomes

Let us seek solutions which have the following form:

The asymptotic fractional neutralization of the beam due to
the backstreaming ions is then just

The differential equation [11] can be solved numerically
and reveals that  the  potential  changes  very  abruptly  from
zero  at  the  target  surface  to  the  space  charge  depressed
potential  of  the  beam  (as  reduced  by  the  backstreaming
ions)  over  a  distance  of  the  order  of  the  beam  radius.
When there is an under-dense plasma gradient the  potential
changes more slowly and rises to a higher value indicating
less neutralization due to backstreaming ions.

The solution  of  Equation  [11]  is  shown  in  Figure  2.
Note that  the  potential  changes rapidly over a  distance  of
order the beam radius when no plasma is present.

dense plasma scale length is  L  then  the  true neutralization

3  Discussion

Figure  3b.  shows  that  the  neutralization  fraction  is
decreased by an order of magnitude when the scale length is
equal  to  a  beam  diameter.    For  typical  parameters  of
interest for  radiography  the  plasma  blow-off  speed  is  on

the  order  of  at  least  several  mm/µsec.    Thus,  the  scale
length  will  be  on  the  order  of  the  beam  diameter  after
several  hundred  nanoseconds.    This  time  is  sufficiently
short  that  even  though  a  plasma  exists  when  a  second
beam  pulse  hits  the  target  there  may  be  no  significant
backstreaming ion emission.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We  have  provided  a  solution  to  the  problem  of  the
space charge limited flow of  ions  from the  critical surface
of  a  target  in  the  presence  of  an  exponentially  varying
under-dense ion background.  Modest density scale lengths
are shown  to  substantially  reduce  the  axial  electric  field
and hence  the  emission  of  backstreaming  ions  from  the
target.    This  result  indicates  that  the  backstreaming  ion
mechanism may not  be a serious threat to  multiple  pulse
trains that hit a Bremsstrahlung target.

Group  delay  for  a  reflected  light  pulse  from  a  weakly  absorbing  dielectric  slab  is 

theoretically  investigated,  and  large  negative  group  delay  is  found  for  weak  absorption 

near a resonance of the slab (

transmitted  pulses  will  be  saturated  with  the  increase  of  the  absorption.    ©  2006  Optical

The  control  of  pulse  propagation  in  different  kinds  of  media  has  received  extensively 

attentions for several decades. 1-4 It is now well established that the group delay (also known as 

the  phase  time)  of  the  reflected  and  transmitted  pulses  can  be  manipulated  from  subluminal 

(slow) to superluminal (fast) propagation by controlling the dispersive properties of a medium. 

Most literatures have been focused on the transmitted pulse from a medium (including the bulk 

materials  3-4 and the photonic layer structures  1-2). Recently, superluminal reflected pulses were

also  theoretically  studied  in  different  circumstances:  such  as  the  unstable  regime  of  optical 

phase-conjugating  mirror,5  low-finesse  Fabry-Perot  cavities  (with  silver  mirrors)  containing 

absorbing atoms, 6 a dielectric slab system doped with absorptive two-level or three-level atoms,7 

asymmetric  photonic  band  gaps,  8  active  fiber  Bragg  gratings,  9  single  quantum  wells  10  and 

asymmetric single quantum barriers. 11 In experiments, Vetter et al.  12 verified the existence of 

the negative phase time for scattering at quantum wells from a microwave analogy experiment. 

Longhi  et  al.  13,  14  have  also  observed  superluminal  reflected  pulse  from  a  double-Lorentzian 

fiber  Bragg  grating.  Recently,  Gevorgyan  15  found  the  anomalies  of  radiation  absorption  and 

superluminal propagation of light in an isotropic layer. Li 16 noticed that the reflected wave from 

a  lossless  dielectric  slab  undergoes  a  phase  discontinuity  (a  sudden  phase  change  of π)  at 

resonant transmission, and he pointed out that the discontinuity of the reflected phase with null 

reflection  has  no  practical  meaning.  In  the  view  of  continuity,  we  expect  that  there  is  a  large 

finite slope of the change of phase with a nonzero, albeit small, reflection if the dielectric slab is 

weakly absorbing.  In this Letter, we report that the negative group delay, which can be large, for 

the  reflected  pulse  near  resonances  from  the  weakly  absorbing  dielectric  slab.  The  negative 

group delay indicates that the superluminal pulse reflection can be observed when a light pulse is 

reflected  from  the  weakly  absorbing  dielectric  slab.  We  also  theoretically  demonstrate  the 

saturation  effect  of  both  the  reflected  and  transmitted  group  delays  with  the  increase  of  the 

absorption.  

Consider a light pulse normally incident on the weakly absorbing dielectric slab (extended 

from

be evaluated with the help of the transfer matrix method 17, 19

We assume that the incident pulse is a Gaussian pulse. In the limit of the very narrow spectrum, 

∆
cωω<<

 (where  ω∆  is the spectral width of the incident pulse, and 

cω  is the carrier frequency, 

i. e., both the reflected and transmitted pulses suffer nominal distortion), the group delays for the 

reflected and transmitted pulse are defined by 6, 20, 21

case,  we  can  find  that  1τ  is  always  equal  to  zero  from  Eq.  (7),  so  the  reflected  group  delay  is 

equal to the transmitted group delay. This has been noticed in many other situations 1, 20, 22. From 

Eqs.(5-7), we can obtain

.  However,  for  the  reflected  group  delay,  it  has  no  physical 

meaning at resonances 

kd =

πm

, owing to the zero reflection [see Fig. 2(b)] and the undefined 

phases [see the sudden phase changes on the dotted curve of 

rφ  in  Fig. 2(c)]. There is a large 

finite slope of the change of phase with a nonzero, albeit small, reflection if the slab is weakly 

absorbing (with complex ε). This large finite slope will lead to the large advancement of 

rτ  for 

the reflected pulse. Actually, in Eq. (6) the first term tτ  is always positive even for the absorptive 

dielectric  slab.  It  is  the  second  term 

1τ  that  leads  the  reflected  group  delay  to  be  negative. 

Especially,  at  resonances  of 

Re(

πm

,  1τ  can  be  simplified  to 

τ −=

clear that  1τ  can be greatly negative for

Figure  2  shows  the  typical  group  delay  of  a  reflected  pulse  from  the  slab  with  thickness 

6=d

mµ  and 

0.3=rε

, where 

0=iε

 (dotted), 0.01 (solid), 0.02 (dash-dotted), 0.05 (dashed) in 

Fig 2a, with the reflection coefficient 

| r  and the relative phases 

|

rφ  in Fig. 2b and 2c. It is seen 

that  the  reflected  group  delay 

rτ  becomes  large  negative  near  the  resonant  frequencies  of  the 

slab with the fixed thickness. For the lossless slab (

0=iε

), we have 

| r =0 and an abrupt phase 

|

jump at the resonance. This effect is similar to that of lateral shift occurring in a lossless slab.16, 

19  For  the  absorbing  slabs,  the  phase  change  at  resonances  becomes  continuous  with  a  large 

negative  slope,  which  leads  to  the  large  negative  group  delay  near  resonances  with  a  nonzero 

reflection. From Fig. 2b, it is found that at resonances the value of  r  decreases as 

iε  decreases, 

while  the  negative  group  delay  of  the  reflected  pulse  becomes  larger  and  larger  (due  to  the 

steeper  phase  change  with  respect  to  angular  frequency ω),  see  Fig.  2a.  We  believe  this  giant 

negative group delay can be observed experimentally. The negative group delay for the reflected 

 5

 

pulse  could  also  occur  in  the  case  of  the  inclined  incidence,  where  the  resonant  condition 

becomes 

Re(

dk z

=)

πm

 with 

zk  being  the  z  component  of  the  wave  vector  in  the  absorbing 

dielectric slab. This effect is very similar to that in asymmetric single quantum barrier,11 and is 

also analogy to the lateral shift of a light beam reflecting from an absorptive slab. 19 

In  Fig.  3(a)  we  plot  the  dependence  of  the  group  delays  on  the  slab  thickness  for  the 

reflected  and  transmitted  pulses  from  a  slab  with 

0.3=rε

 and 

02.0=iε

 at  the  frequency 

2/
=πωc

9.129

THz. It is clear that, owing to the absorption of the medium, the group delay of 

the  reflected  pulse  is  not  equal  to  that  of  the  transmitted  pulses,  and  the  group  delay  of  the 

reflected  pulse  becomes  large  negative  when  the  thickness  d  approaches  the  resonance,  while 

the group delay of the transmitted pulse is still positive. In Fig. 3(b) we plot the dependence of 

the reflected and transmitted group delays on the absorptive parameter 

iε  with 

6=d

mµ  (very 

close to the resonance of 

9=m

), and other parameters are the same as in Fig. 3(a). It can be seen 

that near resonance the reflected group delay becomes a very large negative when the absorption 

is sufficiently weak. For example, for 

04.0=iε

 we have 

15.0−≈rτ

ps, while for 

.0=iε

013

 the 

reflected  group  delay  becomes  much  more  negative, 

53.0−≈rτ

ps.  Both  the  reflected  and 

transmitted group delay will be saturated with the increasing of the absorption. Similar saturation 

effects in 

| r  and 

|

| t

|

 as the increase of 

iε  are also clear in Fig, 3. This is due to that an increase 

of the absorption leads to an increase in the effective barrier thickness, resulting in the saturation 

effect of the reflected and transmitted group delays as in the Hartman effect.23  

We have theoretically shown the negative reflected group delay of a light pulse reflected 

from the weakly absorbing dielectric slab near the resonance 

Re

(
kd =

) πm

. The amount of the 

negative  group  delay  of  the  reflected  pulse  becomes  very  large  when  the  absorption  of  the 

 6

 

dielectric slab is sufficiently weak; at the same time, the intensity of the reflected pulse becomes 

weaker. We also demonstrate the saturation effects of both the reflected and transmitted group 

delays with the absorbing parameter.

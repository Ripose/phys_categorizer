Abstract

The photodetachement of H-  in a quantum well is investigated based on closed orbit
theory. It is found the distances between the ion and the two hard walls modulate the
cross section of photodetachment. For the hard walls perpendicular the polarization of
photons,  the  detachment  spectrum  displays  a  staircase  structure.  The  pattern  of
staircase is modulated by the ratio of distances from the ion to the two walls while the
distance controls step interval of the staircase structure.

The  interaction  between  atoms[1],  ions[2]  and  molecules[3]  with  metal  and
dielectric surfaces  has  attracted considerable  interest  in recent  years. The  interaction
between the atomic and metallic electronic clouds can lead to a variety of phenomena,
such  as  charge  transfer  and  associated  orbital  hybridization  processes.  Aside  from
their basic scientific relevance, studies of atom(molecule)-surface interaction become
increasingly  important  in  conjunction  with  technological  applications  such  as  the
development of ion sources, control of ion-wall interactions in fusion plasma, surface
chemistry  and  analysis,  secondary-ion  mass  spectroscopy,  reactive  ion  etching,  and
semiconductor miniaturization via thin-film deposition[4,5].

On the other hand, the photo-induced electronic  excitation of atoms and  ions on
metal  surfaces  interact  with  the  surface  states  and  its  dynamical  evolution  reveals
important  imformation  on  the  surface  and  its  adsorbates[6,7].  Rencently,  we
-H with  and  without  an  electric  field  near  an
investigated  the  photodetachment  of
elastic  wall  based  on  the  semiclassical  closed  orbit  theory  and  “exact”  quantum
approach[8,9,10].  It  has  been  found  that  the  cross  section  of  near  an  elastic  wall
shows an irregular staircase structure with sharp edge of each step. The same system
without the external electric field shows a sinusoidal modulation in the cross section.
In present work, we put a negative ion of hydrgen in a quantum well consisting of two
hard walls and investigate its photo-induced properties by closed orbit theory[11,12].
We  find  that  its  photodetachment  cross  section    show  a  similar  staircase  curve  but
with a complicated structure which is related the ratio of distances from the ion to the
two walls. Such interesting structure can be attributed to the interference between two
beams of photodetached electronic waves in opposite directions.

We  consider  the  following  system:  In  the  cylindrical  coordinates  (

,

,z

),  a

hydrogen negative ion

-H   sits at the origin and a z-polarized laser is applied for the

photodetachment. The ion is in a quantum wall where two hard wall locate at

1z   (up

wall)  and

(down  wall)  respectively(we  take  positive

1z   and

2z ).  Thus  the

2z-

photodetached electrons move freely in (

)

,

  plane and are bounced back and forth

by  the  two  walls  in z-direction.  In  all the  classical trajectories  of  the  photodetached
electron  emanating  out  the  origin,  those  bounced  back  by  the  walls  to  the  starting
point are called closed orbits. The system of closed orbits is similar to the case of the
gradient electric field[13]. Clearly, all the closed orbits lay in z-axis, and the following
are fundamental: ( All other closed orbits consist of these fundamental orbits and their
repetitions). (i) The electron goes up along the +z direction, reaches its maximum and
then bounced back  by the up wall and return to the origin.  We call this orbit the up
orbit. (ii) The electron goes down in –z direction and hits the down wall and bounces
back  and  finally  return  to  the  origin.  We  call  this  orbit  the  down  orbit.  (iii)  The
electron  completes  the  up  orbit  first  and  then  passing  through  the  origin,  and
continues to complete the down orbit. (iv) The electron completes the down orbit first

and then up orbit. This orbit is similar to the one of (iii) but in reverse order.
 
To classify the system of closed orbits, indices j and n are used to label the orbits,
where j=1,2,3,4  and n=0,1,2,3….  Here  n=0  means  the  orbit  is  fundamental  closed
orbit( j=1,2,3 and 4 for the fundamental closed orbits above, respectively). When n>0,
orbit(j,  n)  has  two  parts, the beginning  part  and the  later  part.  The beginning  part  is
always  the jth  fundamental  closed  orbit.  The  later  part  consists  of  n  repetitions  of
periodic orbits j=3 or  4.  For the  case  of  j=1,  it’s n  repetitions of j=3,  and  for j=2,  it
corresponds  to n  repetitions  of j=4.  For  periodic  orbit j=3 or j=4,  it  repeats  itself n

times. The returning time

jT   of the fundamental closed orbits are

propagates outward in all directions. The electron moves in a straight line at constant
speed before it hits the hard walls.   We propagate the electron wave semiclassically.
The  semiclassical  wave  is  finally  reflected  by  the  elastic  walls.  Thus,  some  of  the
wave  returns  to  the  vicinity  of  the  core  and  interfere  with  the  outgoing  wave  to
produce the  spectral pattern of the  photodetachment[11,12].  In this physical picture,

The outgoing Green’s  function is denoted  by (cid:214)G + .  The  dipole  operator D is equal to

the projection of the electron coordinate onto the direction of polarization of the laser
field.  Eq.(7)  has  the  following  physical  meaning:  the  initial  state  is  modified  by the
dipole  operator  related  with  the  incident  laser  field  to  become  the  source  wave
function;  the  Green’s  function  propagates  these  waves  outward  to  become  the
outgoing  waves;  and  finally  the  waves  overlap  with  the  source  wave  to  give  the
absorption spectrum.
 
The  outgoing  wave  can  be  divided  into  two  parts.  The  first  part  never  goes  far
from  the  core  and  it  is  called  the  direct  wave.  The  second  part  is  known  as  the
returning wave that propagates outward into the external region first, then is reflected
by the elastic walls, and finally returns to the vicinity of the core to interfere with the
outgoing wave. Accordingly, the cross section has two parts,

Only the waves associated with the closed orbits return to the vicinity of the core and
interfere  with  the  steadily-producing  outgoing  spherical  waves  and  therefore
contribute the cross section. The returning waves near the core must  be cylindrically
symmetric
and  thus  can  be  approximated  by  incoming  Bessel  functions.  And  the
returning wave function related with closed orbit (j,n) must match the Bessel function

The  photodetachment  cross  section  can  be  calculated  for  different  values  of the
distances  between the  ion and the two  elastic walls and different  ratio  of them. The
results are shown from Fig. 1 to 3. We can see that the detachment spectrum displays
a staircase structure. This structure results from the superposition of the contribution
from the  four  fundamental closed  orbits  and  their  repetitions.  In  Fig.1,  we  keep  the

distance to the down wall

2z   fixed at  200 a. u. and change 1z , the distance to the up

wall.  When the distance

1z   is very large, the present system should recover the case

when only one hard  wall exists. Taking

6000

  a.  u., the calculated cross section

z =

1

is  shown  in  Fig.  1(a).  The  spectrum  is  almost  the  same  as  a  superposition  of  a
background and a sinusoidal oscillation except some very small steps appeared in the

oscillation.  When

0z ﬁ

,  then T2, T3,  and T4  tend  to  infinity,  so  there  are  no

contributions  from  these  closed  orbits,  the  only  closed  orbit  makes  the  sinusoidal
spectral  oscillation.  When  the  closer  we  move  the  wall  to  the  ion,  the  more
contribution from the orbits bounces back by the up wall. We can see the elastic wall
change the cross section from the smooth oscillation to  a staircase curve. If the wall
approaches the ion further, we can see the interval of step of the staircase goes wider
in Fig. 1(b) and (c).

In Fig.2, we show how the ratio of the two distance to walls influence the pattern
of the staircase. When the ratio  is a rational number, we have a periodic structure as

interfere  constructively  and  make  a  regular  pattern.  While  they  are  mismatched,  a
irregular staircase pattern appears.

We explore this interesting feature further by fixing the ration but change the two
distances  to the walls simultaneously.  The result  is shown  in Fig.  3.  In Fig.  3(a)  and

(b), the ratio is fixed to 2 but

2z   goes from 200 a.u. to 400 a.u. We can see that the

two pattern are similar but with different interval of step of staircase. Fig. 3(c) and (d)
show  the  case of the  irrational ratio.  We  can  see  the  obvious  similarity  between the
two irregular patterns but no perodity.

In  summary,  the  photodetachment  cross  section  of

-H   in  a  quantum  well  has
been  investigated  in  the  framework  of  closed  orbit  theory  and  an  analytical  cross
section  has  been  obtained  as  the  summation  of  all closed  orbits.  We  found  that  the
photodetachment  spectrum shows staircase structure because of the constraint  of the
quantum  well  to  the  photodetached  electrons,  contrasting  with  the  regular  smooth
oscillating  curve  when  only  an  elastic  wall  exists.  The  new  feature  in  the  present
system  is  that  the  ratio  modulates  the  pattern  of  the  staircase  while  the  distances
determine the step interval of staircase.

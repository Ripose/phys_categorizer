Macroquantum effects in condensed matter

Prof. A.M. Ilyanok

Abstract
Quantum relativistic probability description of continuous world is re-examined. The new
conception  of  physical  world  is  offered.  It  is  based  on  deterministic  description  of  elementary
particles, on conception

The  standard  probability  quantum  relativistic  picture  of  world  is  reviewed.  The  new
picture  of  world  is  proposed.  It  is  based  on  deterministic  approach  to  elementary  particles,
discrete  model  of  space  determined  by  segmentation  of  particles  and  their  fields  and  also  by
introduction of 9 Lorentz groups of transformations between systems of reference.

It  is  supposed  that  elementary  particles  are  segmented  in  space  and  change  their  form

dependent on phase and structural state of substance.

This  approach  allow  to  use  linear  differential  second  order  equations  to  describe

interactions. Maxwell equations are the partial case of them.

This  approach  allow  to  eliminate  basic  paradoxes  of  quantum  field  theory  and  quantum

mechanics and gives a new interpretation of well known experiments.

To confirm the theory proposed basic parameters of macroquantum effects in condensed
medium  including  cosmic  objects  are  calculated.  Particularly,  parameters  of  high  temperature
superconductors being stable till temperature 93,50C are calculated. It is supposed that electrons
in atomic hydrogen at  60000C at the Sun can occur in superconducting state.

In  20th  century  classical  mechanics  had  not  being  able  to  describe  a  number  of
experimental  effects  found  with  elementary  particles.  So  modification  of  classical  mechanics  by
attributing  wave  properties  to  particles  taking  simultaneously  in  account  their  relativistic
properties  became  evident  close  under  speed  of  light  had  been  occurred.  The  space  properly  in
which  particle  movements  take  place  was  considered  as  Euclidean  continuous  three-dimensional
linear space or as four-dimensional Minkowski space. For cosmic objects it is considered as non-
linear  four-dimensional  pseudo-Riemanian  space  proposed  by  Einstein.  But  such  quantum
relativistic  concept  of  continuous  world  formed  in  the  beginning  of  the  century  did  not  consider
macroscopic quantum effects moreover in space.

Two  most  important  discoveries  of  20th  century,  macroquantum  effects  in  condensed
matter,  was  not  inscribed  in  the  concept  of  world  being  formed  in  such  a  way.  They  are
superconductivity (G. Kamerling-Onness, 1911) and superfluidity of liquid helium (P.L.  Kapitsa,
1938).  But  theoretical  description  of  these  effects  had  become  exclusively  complicated.  Thus,
theory  of  superfluidity  created  by  L.  Landau  in  1941  for  liquid  4HeII  gives  the  result  for
theoretical  calculation  of  critical  speed  of  superfluid  phase  in  100  (!)  times  lower  than  the
experimental one. It took place because Landau theory did not take into account quantum effects
and, therefore, the Planck constant [1].

In theory of superconductivity coupled electrons, so called,  Kooper  pairs,  are  interacting
between  each  other  instantaneously  (there  are  no  retarding  quantities  in  equations)  [2].  It  is
obvious  that  such  assumptions  lead  to  paradoxes  and  violation  of  energy  conservation  law
because exchange forces tend to the infinity and this fact is of no sense.

In  result,  one  should  use  empirical  coefficients  to  fit  to  the  experiment  the  theories  of
superconductivity and superfluidity. This fact lead to low value of them for creation new materials
and  devises  based  on  macroquantum  effects.  A  large  number  of  efforts  to  improve  the  theories
using existing formulation of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory did not give positive
results. It is because that quantum mechanics and quantum field theory use mathematical models

not able to be realized physically. They are based on the concept of “probability wave” by which a
particle is distributed in the space. And at low speed of its movement the probability to find it will
be  essential  in  volume  exceeding  the  volume  of  the  Earth.  It  is  of  no  sense.  Besides  this  the
process  of  emission  or  absorption  of  a  particle  is  changed  by  formal  mathematical  birth-
annihilation operators [3,4]. These  simplified  models  non-adequate  to  the  physical  reality  do  not
enable  to  describe  many  effects  in  micro  and  macro  world.  Essentially,  they  have  become  as
obstacle in developing physics in 20th century.

Physics  always  develop  in  alternative  ways.  But  in  the  20th  century  the  new  effective
mechanism  of  stimulation  of  research  by  Nobel  price  awarding  was  formed.  It  was  the  most
successful  for  experimental  physics.  But  in  theoretical  physics  it  was  lead  to  suppression  of
alternative approaches to the conception of world and only quantum relativistic approach was put
in dogma. In result, the religious approach had been formed in the science.

,  where 

We  stand  on  the  point  of  view  that  in  every  substance  and  even  phase  state  of  the
substance  there  is  special  speed  limit  of  interactions  penetrating.  So  we  suppose  to  consider  all
motions  within  the  media  to  be  covariant  under  the  Lorentz  boost  transformations  specific  to  it
,  n  =  0,  – 1,  – 2,  – 3,  – 4,  where  b   is  a  factor
with  factor 
connected  with  the  properties  of  medium  and  its  phase  state,  a is  fine  structure  constant,  c   is
usual  vacuum  speed  of  light.  The  speed  limits 
nc form  the  series  of  critical  speeds  of  substance
movement. . When n = 0 one obtains usual Lorentz transformation applied only to the movement
of elementary particles in vacuum. When  n = 1 one  obtains  the  speed  limit  of  electrons  in  metal
and  also  the  speed  limit  of  movement  of  substance  in  empty  space.  Exceeding  the  speed 
ca
condensed matter becomes unstable and decays what was found in accelerators of the micro drops
of deuterium and from data of observation of movement of cosmic objects in galaxies [5]. When
23 c=b
n = 2  and 
  coincides  with  average  orbit  speed  of  Mercury.  Besides  this  condition  n = 2
gives for 
2c the  critical  speed  of  electrons  in  low-temperature  superconductors.  Condition  n = 3
yields the critical speed of electrons connected with phonons in low-temperature superconductors.
When  n = 4  the  critical  speed  of  superfluid  vortexes  in  liquid  Helium  is  achieved.  Condition
n = - 1  leads  to  the  speed  of  internuclear  interactions  along  crystal  planes  in  the  Moessbauer
effect. Value  n = - 2  gives  the  minimum  speed  of  gravitational  waves  in  the  Sun  system.  When
n = - 3 one obtains the speed of gravitational interactions within the core of the Galaxy. If  n = -
 4
the speed limit of any gravitational interactions is achieved. For other values of  n  we  did  not  find
appropriate physical phenomena. From such point of view elementary particles can not exceed the
speed of light as it was stated in special theory of relativity. But if one considers the whole set of
possible  Lorentz  groups  it  is  possible  to  describe  transferring  information  with  the  speed  much
more than the speed of light  if n  =  –1, –2, –3, –4.

The second serious problem in physics is the problem what is the dimension of space and
what  is  the  space  structure  of  fields.  To  consider  the  problem  usually  the  many  dimensional
approach  is  wide  use.  Let  us  follow  not  very  common  way  of  decreasing  of  a  number  of
dimensions.  In  this  way  two-dimensional  deterministic  objects,  vortex  rings,  making  their  any
possible space combinations, can represent the three-dimensional world. In this way the concepts
aN knots.
of atom and electron can be formulated  in words of the theory of knots as a locking of 
Let us remind that a knot is a smooth insertion of union of finite number of non-crossing circles in
three-dimensional  space  R3.  All  possible  combinations  of  vortex  rings  in  the  space  give  us  a
feeling of thre-dimensionality of the world.

Turning  to  the  history  of  physics  one  can  find  that  these  ideas  are  not  discovered  at  the
first time. In mathematics, E.  Cartan introduced  fibre bundles of the space connected with world
time.  The  geometry  of  every  spatial  cross-section  was  absolutely  flat  [6].  Earlier,  in  1867  lord
Kelvin  supposed  atoms  as  knotted  vortex  tubes  of  the  ether  like  electromagnetic  vortex  tubes  of
Maxwell. This idea had been developing by his followers and it the following arguments were put
onto the base of it [7]:

•  Stability.  Stability  of  substance  might  be  explained  by  the  stability  of  knots  (the  stability  of

their topological type).

•  Diversity  of  chemical  elements.  It  might  be  explained  by  the  diversity  of  non-equivalent

knots.

tubes

•  Spectra.  Spectral  lines  of  atoms  might  be  explained  as  oscillations  of  correspondent  vortex

•  Transmutation.  In  up-to-date  words  it  is  an  opportunity  for  elements  to  transmute  one  into
other under high energies of interaction might be connected with re-combining of knots using
cuts of knots.

Developing  such  deterministic  approach  to  the  micro  world  one  can  interpret  the  well

known experiments from the new point of view.
Let us suppose that some constant 

aN should be integer number the closest value of which

one may find from the measurement of fine splitting in spectrum of atomic Hydrogen:

 thin thread  -

Analysis  of  energy  spectra  of  stable  movement  of  microparticles    and  new  laws  of
quantisation of energies and orbits of cosmic objects [5],  the supposition that the space is discrete
not only in micro world but in the macro world follows.  Evidently, the single way to explain that
the space is discrete is to close the one-dimensional space  -
 round two-dimensional
space -
 the plane. In result the thin ring is appeared.
Let  us  suppose  the  electron  at  the  minimum  of  its  energy  as  the  thin  uniformly  charged
ring with the charge  e  rotating round its axis with the speed 
c2a . Cross-section of interaction of
such electrons is minimized. Such state of the electron one can observe in vacuum when it moves
with  the  speed  relative  to  the  laboratory  reference  system  less  than 
c2a and in  superconductors
[8]. Diameter of the  such  electron  may  be  find  from  the  experiment  when  tunneling  the  electron
through vacuum gap takes place. It if found experimentally that the tunnel effect disappears when
the distance between electrodes is about 8 nm [9]. This exclusively important  experimental fact is
constantly  ignored.  Let  us  assume  that  the  radius  of  such  ring  electron  is  connected  with  world
constants [8]:

.

When the speed of electron becomes more than 

c2a , the ring electron will transform into
the new the single stable state in the medium with self-interaction [10]. It will roll up in uniformly
charged  shallow  tore  of  smaller  size  rotating  round  its  axis  with  the  speed  c .  In  this  state  the
electron will be three-dimensional object as it is shown on the fig. 1.

The size of the tore is such that closed geodesic line on it will roll strictly  861 times round
the surface of the tore. The large radius of the tore is equal to 
.  This  value  is
found  experimentally  from  the  Compton  scattering  of  gamma-quanta  on  electrons.  The  lowest
radius of the tore will be equal to  (

size totally coincides with the classical electron radius.

It  is  found  experimentally  that  scattering  of  electrons  on  each  other  or  the  scattering
phonons  on  electrons  in  three-dimensional  space  is  happening  just  at  such  distances.  The  model
proposed enables us to avoid three basic paradoxes of classical electron. In the classical model all
mass of the electron is concentrated in electromagnetic field and the speed of the charge created
its own electromagnetic field is equal to 137.036 c . Besides this, eigen-proper angular momentum
of the electron, the spin, can not be equal to –
h /2 in principal.  In the model presented the internal
charge is moving along the tore surface with the speed  c but  the electromagnetic mass will be of
1/137,036  part  of  its  total  mass  me,  and  the  spin  of  electron  is  describing  by  the  eigen-proper
angular  momentum  of  the  movement  of  the  hollow  tore  whet  it  rotates  round  its  axis  and  equal
h /2.  This  fact  automatically  eliminates  the  existing  discrepancies  in  the  model  of  classical
electron. While moving in an empty space the spin of electron is rotating along or opposite to the
direction of the movement and its electromagnetic field rotates along or opposite to the direction
of movement of the electron.

0ra ,  but  its  speed  is  decreasing  till 

The  electron  can  change  its  form  when  transition  of  it  from  vacuum  to  the  substance  is
happened.  Under  transition  of  the  electron  from  the  vacuum  to  substance  it  can  change  its  form.
The  most  simple  variant  when  the  electron  is  coupling  with  the  proton  forming  the  Hydrogen
atom.  We consider this formation as proton gets into potential hole of tore-type electron. In this
case  the  large  tore  radius  becomes  equal  to 
ca .  These
parameters  coincide  with  the  model  of  Bohr  atom.  And  basic  parameters  of  the  electron  are
. This concept of atom
change only on the amount of binding energy of it with proton 
allows totally to avoid the basic paradox of movement of a charge particle round a nucleus when a
classical charged particle must emit radiation while running round and, therefore, to drop down to
nucleus  in  very  short  time.  In  the  model  proposed  above  an  electron  is  not  affected  by  orbital
accelerations,  so  it  can  not  emit  electromagnetic  waves.  Moreover,  optical  spectra  are  easily
described by discrete change of size and speed of the shell of the tore simulating an electron. Fine
splitting  if  spectral  lines  are  connected  with  segmentation  of  an  electron  and  superfine  one
corresponds  to  vibration  modes  of  the  shell  of  the  electron  tore  coursed  by  the  nucleus.  In
classical  quantum  field  theory  these  effects  are  ascribed  to  an  interaction  of  an  electron  with  so
called  “physical  vacuum”.  In  the  model  proposed  it  is  not  necessary  to  use  a  new  theory  of  the
ether. If an electron is in condensed substance its spin characteristics can be changed because of

changing  the  moment  of  inertia  because  of  changing  of  its  matter  distribution  along  the  cross-
section of the tore. Mass of a free electron is distributed along the shell. If the speed of rotation of
ca ,  that  is  always  takes  place  in  condensed  matter,  so  the  electron
the shell is less or equal to 
mass is uniformly distributed along the cross-section of the tore. In this case its moment of inertia
is  changed  and  its  spin  will  be  equal  to 
.  Such  ‘fractional’  spin  electrons  have  in

paramagnetic materials.

Let us now consider the spatial structure of the external fields of an electron. Considering
an electron as a tore let us cross it 861 times by transversal plane along its large diameter like lists
of a book opened on 360(cid:176) . So fields of rings or discs appeared by this section form its electrostatic
field. Closed lines in their planes represent magnetic field of the electron like co-central circles on
each  plane  of  the  ring  or  disc.  The  configuration  of  the  field  of  an  electron  is  presented  on  the

layers. Interaction between an electron and external electromagnetic field is because of transversal
layers.  Taking  into  account  such  character  of  interaction  and  ‘fractional’  spin  one  may  calculate
anomalous magnetic moment of an electron what gives

To calculate anomalous magnetic moment of the electron in quantum electrodynamics some
mathematical  trick,  renormalisation,  is  used.  It  does  not  give  mathematical  self-consistent  of
quantum electrodynamics. In our case the theory is self-consistent.

Let us now consider how interaction of particles takes place in the model proposed. Let us
suppose that a proton like an electron also forms the discrete fields. The model of a proton is much
complicated. It will be described in further publications. Binding in atoms electron and proton also
form discrete fields round themselves.

If two charges interact between each other by a field so this field is an object of matter and,
therefore,  should  possess  some  elasticity.  Namely  the  field  not  the  vacuum  is  considered  as  an
elastic medium round the particle. Equations of movement of an elastic medium can be described
by well known equations for deviations of compression and shift [4]:

where  u  is vector of deviation of the field,  F  is the vector of a force external to the medium,  ct  is
the transversal wave speed and cl  is the longitudinal wave speed for elastic medium. Maxwell and
Newton equations are derived from this equation as partial cases. This equation, essentially, unites
classical mechanics and electrodynamics.

Interaction  between  particles  is  realised  by  waves  linked  with  an  elastic  medium  and

moving along planes crossing a tore.

For  instance,  according  to  our  model  boundary  conditions  for  equation  (4)  applying  to
coupling electrons are defined by the form of the field like cross-section of a tore when electrons
are at the opposite parts of such disc.

The  theory  of  elasticity  gives  that  internal  strengthes  coursed  by  the  external  forses  act  in
  and  for  bending  like  1/R3  [4].  This  dependence  of  force  on
compression-stretching  like  1/R2
distance provides description between charges and magnetic dipoles. In other words,  Coulomb’s
and  Ampere’s  laws  follow  from  the  model  naturally.  In  our  model  interaction  is  realised  by
longitudinal waves in matter but not by photons exchanging.

From  the  equation  (4)  is  followed  that  the  longitudinal  speed  is  always  more  than
transversal one, at least, in 21/2 times. If two interacting particles move relative each other with the
 so longitudinal wave speed will be much more than the  speed of  light if one take

into account the relation 
.  This  condition  was  firstly  formulated  by  de  Broile  in  his
dissertation. But he can not explain the mechanism of ‘up-to-light’ interactions. Later on his result
was  constantly  ignored.  Let  us  note  that  there  was  no  experimental  confirmation  that  speeds  of
interaction of slowly moving particles are equal to the speed of light. All interactions, as usual, are
carried out at relativistic speeds.

It is automatically follows from the equation (4) that the transversal wave can not penetrate
with the speed more than the speed of light that it was noted by Maxwell in his basic work. So no
particle  which  is  a  transversal  wave  itself,  and,  particularly,  condensed  matter  cannot  move  with
speeds  exceeding  the  speed  of  light.  Interaction  between  particles  by  longitudinal  waves  can
penetrate  by  speeds  much  exceeding  the  speed  of  light  what  can  be  used  for  transmission  of
information in the Galaxy scale. The problem of physical interpretation of longitudinal waves was
met yet by Maxwell while he derived his equations. Later on these waves were omitted as having
no physical sense.

On the base of the model proposed the most complicated effects were calculated. They are,
first of all, points of phase transition of types I and II. The most important conclusions connected
with phase transitions of the type II as macroquantum effects are given without deriving in table1.
Our  model  of  electron  and  its  movement  in  condensed  media  all  deficiencies  of  existing
models  of  superfluidity  and  superconductivity  are  eliminated  automatically.  In  theory  of
superconductivity  the  retarding  quantities  connected  with  transversal  and  longitudinal  wave
speeds are introduced  (3).  Limiting  parameters  calculated  according  to  the  model  proposed  have
high  coincidence  with  experimental  data  for  high  temperature  superconductivity  without
correcting coefficients. At that, our expressions include only the world constants and coefficients
connected with the geometry of fields, boundary conditions and character of motion.

To  verify  the  reliability  of  the  model  macroquantum  effects  at  phase  transitions  in  the
processes of the stars and Solar system generation were considered [5]. Preliminary analysis allow
to  state  that  there  is  a  phenomenon  of  high  temperature  superfluidity  in  atomic  hydrogen  at
temperatures like 6000

C.

aN = 861  is  transversal  quantum  number;  a is  fine  structure  constant  or  longitudinal  quantum

number; e  is elementary charge;  h
mass of  4He atom;  Mi  is  the  ion  mass  in  the  crystal  lattice; 
mass of proton; k is the Boltzman constant ;

is the Planck constant ;  c  is the speed of light; Ì  is  the

em is  the  mass  of  electron; 

pm   is  the

 is so called heavy mass of the electron.

The  table  shows  that  laws  in  macro  and  micro  world  are  the  same.  One  able  to  measure
macroquantum effects very precisely because it is possible to use “three-dimensional” devises.  In
micro  world  “three-dimensional”  devises  reflect  two-dimensional  objects  on  thre-dimensional
world.  Because  of  segmentation  of  elementary  particles  the  uncertainty  like  Heisenberg  one  is
occurred.  Probability  description  of  elementary  particles  followed  from  this  principle  can  be,
therefore, overcome.

Analysis of data in table 1 gives that the picture of the world proposed also to describe the
most complicated physical effects and to eliminate basic paradoxes appeared in the physics of the
20th  century.  There  is  no  necessity  to  base  on  complex  philosophical  and  mathematical  concepts
from  which  one  can  not  obtain  a  mathematical  approach  appropriate  to  calculate  experimental
data.  Our  model  yields  to  one  of  the  basic  criteria  of  the  theory:  it  has  a  limit  coincided  with
previous theories tested on the experiment.

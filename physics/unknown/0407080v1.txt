Abstract:  We  comment  of  the  widespread  belief  among  some  undergraduate  students  that  the 
amplitude of any harmonic oscillator in the presence of any type of friction, decays exponentially 
in  time.  To dispel  that  notion,  we  compare  the  amplitude  decay  for  a  harmonic  oscillator  in  the 
presence of (i) viscous friction and (ii) dry friction. It is shown that, in the first case, the amplitude 
decays exponentially with time while in the second case, it decays linearly with time.

1.  Introduction 
The problem of oscillatory motion is, without any doubt, one of the main topics in physics, from elementary up to 
advanced courses. An understanding of this motion is also relevant in many areas outside physics, including 
chemistry,  biology,  engineering,  medical  research  and  economics,  to  name  a  few.  In  physics,  students  encounter 
oscillatory behavior in classical mechanics, electricity, optics and later, in quantum mechanics. 
 
When considering adding some `realistic' features to a simple harmonic oscillator, such as damping effects, it is a 
common practice in  many textbooks, to consider only the case of an oscillator in the presence of a viscous force, 
where the resistive force is  (cid:22)-
v, where  (cid:22) is the viscous coefficient and v is the velocity of the oscillator. As shown 
in many textbooks1, this leads to an exponential decrease of the oscillator's amplitude with time. One important case 
which is  not  normally treated in standard textbooks is the  oscillator  in the presence of  sliding (dry)  friction, even 
though this type of friction is present in all aspects of our life. Because of this, some students are led to believe that, 
in  the  absence  of  driving  forces,    the  motion  of  a  harmonic  oscillator  in  the  presence  of  any  friction,  will  decay 
exponentially in time. 
 
Here  we  try  to  dispell  that  notion  by  comparing  the  amplitude  decay  for  a  harmonic  oscillator  in  the  presence  of 
viscous friction and dry friction. 
 
2.   Viscous friction 
A simple example of this is an object like a pendulum, or a block attached to a spring, that oscillates in the presence 
of a drag force provided, for instance, by the surrounding air. At low speeds, the resistive force has the form  (cid:22)-
v, 
where (cid:22)  is the viscous coefficient and is v the velocity of the oscillator. In one dimension, Newton's equation reads:

 After replacing in Eq.(1), we obtain an equation for l :

and  the  oscillator  amplitude  is  then  exponentially  damped  with  time.  In  particular,  this  means  that  the  maximum 
amplitude  points  x n where  the  velocity  is  zero,  will  also  decay  exponentially  in  time  or  cycle  number  n.    Let  us 
show explicitly how  x n  depends on n: From (3), the oscillator's velocity  v(t) = dx(t)/dt is found to be

From (5) it is clear that the envelope of the oscillatory motion decays exponentially with the half-cycle number n. 
This is readily apparent in the envelope of the oscillatory motion depicted in Fig.1.  
 
 
3.    Sliding (dry) friction 
This  motion  has  been  analyzed  by  several  authors  with  varying  degrees  of  sophistication2,3,4,5.  We  will  restrict 
ourselves here to a very elementary treatment, which can be followed by a student with little or no calculus.  The 
most common example of this motion is that of a block resting on a rough table and attached to a horizontal spring. 
Let us assume equal values for the static and kinetic coefficients of friction. Newton's equation in this case reads: 

 

 

m

where  m
 is the coefficient of dry friction, and sgn(x) is defined to be +1 for x > 0, -1 for x < 0 and zero for x=0. 
Thus, the frictional force is constant in magnitude but acts in the opposite direction to the velocity. Suppose  we start 
0k A must  be 
from  rest  with  an  initial  amplitude 
greater  that  the  magnitude  of  the  static  friction,  m g

The block will swing back, provided 

. If this is so, at the end of the cycle, 

Eventually however, the oscillator's maximum amplitude will decrease below  

cA , and the spring will not be strong 

enough to overcome the dry friction and subsequently, all motion will stop. 
 
As Eq.(11) clearly shows, the decay of the maximum amplitude of the oscillator is linear with the half-cycle number 
(or time), and is vividly illustrated in Fig.1. This stands in marked contrast with the previous case of the oscillator 
subjected to viscous friction.

Now, as to the question of  why most Physics textbooks do not consider dry friction and focus on viscous friction 
only when dealing with a damped harmonic oscillator, it probably has to do with the rather awkward  form of the 
dry friction term:  -sgn(dx/dt) m g
, which is not amenable to a simple closed-form solution, as in the viscous 
case.

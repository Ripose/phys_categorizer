Ellipticity of boundary value problems is caracterized in terms of the Calderon projector. The
presence of topological obstructions for the chiral Dirac operator under local boundary conditions
in even dimension is discussed. Functional determinants for Dirac operators on manifolds with
boundary are considered.

The functional determinant for a Dirac operator on a bidimensional disk, in the presence of an
Abelian gauge ﬁeld and subject to global boundary conditions of the type introduced by Atiyah-
Patodi-Singer, is evaluated. The relationship with the index theorem is also commented.

INTRODUCTION

The wide application of functional determinants in Quantum and Statistical Physics is by now a well known fact.
In order to evaluate one-loop eﬀects, one faces to the necessity of deﬁning a regularized determinant for elliptic
diﬀerential operators, among which the Dirac ﬁrst order one plays a central role. An interesting related problem is
the modiﬁcation of physical quantities due to the presence of boundaries. The study of boundary eﬀects has lately
received much attention, both in mathematics and physics, since it is of importance in many diﬀerent situations [1–9],
like index theorems for manifolds with boundary, eﬀective models for strong interactions, quantum cosmology and
application of QFT to statistical systems, among others (see [10] for a recent review).

In previous work [11,12], we studied elliptic Dirac boundary problems in the case of local boundary conditions.
In particular, we developed for this case a scheme for evaluating determinants from the knowledge of the associated
Green’s function, based on Seeley’s theory of complex powers [13].

Another type of boundary conditions extensively studied in the literature are global ones, of the type introduced by
Atiyah, Patodi and Singer (APS) [14] in connection with the index theorem for manifolds with boundaries (see [15,10]
for a review.) Other motivation for considering these global (or spectral) conditions is the presence of topological
obstructions for the chiral Dirac operator under local boundary conditions (although this restriction no longer holds
when considering the whole Dirac operator [11].)

ELLIPTIC BOUNDARY PROBLEMS AND REGULARIZED DETERMINANTS

An operator D is elliptic at x if σω(D)(x, ξ) is invertible ∀ ξ 6= 0.
If D is elliptic in a compact region Ω then, for |ξ| > 0,

|σω(D)(x, ξ)| ≥ constant. |ξ|ω > 0,

∀ x ∈ Ω,

since both sides are homogeneous of degree ω, and aα(x) ∈ C∞.

For example, in R2, the operator D = −i(∂1 + i∂2) is elliptic, since ξ1 + iξ2 = 0 ⇒ ξ = 0. The Laplacian,

∇ = (∂1)2 + (∂2)2 is also elliptic.

Given f (x) ∈ S(Rν ), the Schwartz space, and its Fourier transform ˆf (ξ), the action of D on f can be expressed as

A pseudodiﬀerential operator whose symbol decreases faster than any power of ξ is called inﬁnitely smoothing.
Two pseudodiﬀerential operators are said to be equivalent if they diﬀer by an inﬁnitely smoothing operator. This
equivalence allows for the introduction of asymptotic expansions of symbols.

The Calder´on projector and Elliptic boundary problems

We will be concerned with boundary value problems associated to ﬁrst order elliptic operators

D : C∞(M, E) → C∞(M, F ),

where M is a bounded closed domain in Rν with smooth boundary ∂M , and E and F are k-dimensional complex
vector bundles over M.

In general, such diﬀerential operators have a closed range of ﬁnite codimension, but an inﬁnite-dimensional space

of solutions,

Ker(D) = {ϕ(x)/Dϕ(x) = 0, x ∈ M } .

Hence, to get a well deﬁned problem, we have to restrict the class of admissible sections. The natural way of doing this
is by imposing boundary conditions which exclude almost all solutions of the operator, leaving only a ﬁnite-dimensional
kernel.

In a collar neighborhood of ∂M in M, we will take coordinates ¯x = (x, t), with t the inward normal coordinate
and x local coordinates for ∂M (that is, t > 0 for points in M \ ∂M and t = 0 on ∂M ), and conjugate variables
¯ξ = (ξ, τ ).

One of the most suitable tools for studying boundary problems is the Calder´on projector Q [16]. For the case we

are interested in, D of order 1 as in (8), Q is a (not necessarily orthogonal) projection

Q : L2(∂M, E/∂M ) → {T ϕ /ϕ ∈ Ker(D)},

(10)

being T : C∞(M, E) → C∞(∂M, E/∂M ) the trace map.

As shown in [16], Q is a zero-th order pseudo diﬀerential operator, and its principal symbol q(x; ξ), depends only

on the principal symbol of D, σ1(D).

for
Given any fundamental solution K(¯x, ¯y) of D, the projector Q can be constructed in the following way:
f ∈ C∞(∂M, E/∂M ), one gets ϕ ∈ Ker(D) by means of a Green formula involving K(¯x, ¯y), and takes the limit
of ϕ for ¯x → ∂M .

Although Q is not uniquely deﬁned, since one can take any fundamental solution K of D to construct it, the image

of Q and its principal symbol q(x; ξ) are independent of the choice of K [16].

We ﬁnd it enlightening to compute the principal symbol of the Calder´on projector for the Dirac operator

where {Aµ, µ = 0, ..., ν − 1} is the gauge ﬁeld. In the present case, k is the dimension of the Dirac spinors in Rν,
k = 2[ν/2].

Let K(¯x, ¯y) be a fundamental solution of the Dirac operator D(A) in a neighborhood of the region M⊂ Rν, i.e.

According to Calder´on [16], elliptic boundary conditions can be deﬁned in terms of q(x; ξ), the principal symbol of

the projector Q.
Deﬁnition 1:
Let us assume that the rank of q(x; ξ) is a constant r (as is always the case for ν ≥ 3 [16]).
A zero-th order pseudo diﬀerential operator

B : [L2(∂M, E/∂M )] → [L2(∂M, G)],

with G an r dimensional complex vector bundle over ∂M, gives rise to an elliptic boundary condition for a ﬁrst order
operator D if,

∀ξ : |ξ| ≥ 1,

rank(b(x; ξ) q(x; ξ)) = rank(q(x; ξ)) = r,

where b(x; ξ) coincides with the principal symbol of B for |ξ| ≥ 1.

In this case we say that

is an elliptic boundary problem, and denote by DB the closure of D acting on the sections ϕ ∈ C∞(M, E) satisfying
B(T ϕ) = 0.



An elliptic boundary problem as (25) has a solution ϕ ∈ H 1(M, E) for any (χ, f ) in a subspace of L2(M, E) ×
H 1/2(∂M, G) of ﬁnite codimension. Moreover, this solution is unique up to a ﬁnite dimensional kernel [16]. In other
words, the operator

(D, BT ) : H 1(M, E) → L2(M, E) × H 1/2(∂M, G)

is Fredholm.

For ν = 2, Deﬁnition 1 not always applies. For instance, for the two dimensional chiral Euclidean Dirac operator

acting on sections with positive chirality and taking values in the subspace of sections with negative one, it is easy to
see from (22) that

Then, the rank of q(x; ξ) is not constant. In fact,

However, for the (full) two dimensional Euclidean Dirac operator

q(x; ξ) = H(ξ).

rank q(x; ξ) =

Local boundary conditions

we get from (20) that rank q(x; ξ) = 2/2 = 1 ∀ξ 6= 0, and so Deﬁnition 1 does apply.

When B is a local operator, Deﬁnition 1 yields the classical local elliptic boundary conditions, also called Lopatinsky-

Shapiro conditions (see for instance [18]) .

For Euclidean Dirac operators on Rν, E/∂M = ∂M × Ck, and local boundary conditions arise when the action of
2 × k matrix of functions deﬁned on ∂M.

B is given by the multiplication by a k

Owing to topological obstructions, chiral Dirac operators in even dimensions do not admit local elliptic boundary
conditions (see for example [19]). For instance, in four dimensions, by choosing the γ-matrices at x = (x1, x2, x3) ∈ ∂M
as

So qch(x; ξ) is a hermitian idempotent 2×2 matrix with rank = 1. If one had a local boundary condition with principal
symbol b(x) = (β1(x), β2(x)), according to Deﬁnition 1, it should be rank(b(x) qch(x; ξ)) = 1, ∀ξ 6= 0. However, it is
easy to see that for

Global boundary conditions

A type of non-local boundary conditions to be consider is related to the ones deﬁned and analyzed by M. Atiyah,
V. Patodi and I. Singer in [14] for a wide class of ﬁrst order Dirac-like operators, including the Euclidean chiral case.
Near ∂M such operators can be written as

where ρ : E → F is an isometric bundle isomorphism, and

̺ (∂t + A),

A : L2(∂M, E/∂M ) → L2(∂M, E/∂M )

is self adjoint. The operator PAP S deﬁning the boundary condition is the orthogonal projection onto the closed
subspace of L2(∂M, E/∂M ) spanned by the eigenfunctions of A associated to non negative eigenvalues,

PAP S =

φλ(φλ, ·), where Aφλ = λφλ.

Xλ≥0

The projector PAP S is a zero-th order pseudo diﬀerential operator and its principal symbol coincides with the one of
the corresponding Calder´on projector [20].

The problem (25)

Dϕ = χ in M




PAP ST ϕ = f at ∂M

with B = PAP S has a solution ϕ ∈ H 1(M, E) for any (χ, f ) with χ in a ﬁnite codimensional subspace of L2(M, E) and
f in the intersection of H 1/2(∂M, E/∂M ) with the image of PAP S. The solution is unique up to a ﬁnite dimensional
kernel. Note that, since the codimension of PAP S [L2(∂M, E/∂M )] is not ﬁnite, the operator



(D, PAP ST ) : H 1(M, E) → L2(M, E) × H 1/2(∂M, E/∂M )

is not Fredholm.

It is to be stressed that, even though PAP S has the same principal symbol as Q, their actions are, roughly speaking,
opposite. In fact, the Calder´on proyector is related to the problem of the inner extension of section over the boundary
to global solutions on the manifold. On the other hand, the action of PAP S is related to the outer extension problem, in
the sense that the solutions of DPAP S admit a square-integrable prolongation on the non-compact elongation obtained
from M by attaching a semi-inﬁnite cylinder (−∞, 0] × ∂M to the boundary.

Deﬁnition 1 for elliptic boundary conditions does not encompass Atiyah, Patodi and Singer (APS) conditions since
PAP S takes values in L2(∂M, E/∂M ) instead of L2(∂M, G), with G an r dimensional vector bundle (r = rank q(x; ξ)),
as required in that deﬁnition. However, it is possible to deﬁne elliptic boundary problems according to Deﬁnition 1
by using conditions `a la APS. For instance, the following self-adjoint boundary problem for the two-dimensional full
Euclidean Dirac operator is elliptic:

(cid:18)

ϕ1
ϕ2 (cid:19)

(cid:18)
In fact, as mentioned above, the principal symbol of PAP S is equal to the principal symbol of the Calder´on projector

associated to D. So, from (28) we get

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

By taking adjoints we obtain

σ0(PAP S)(x, ξ) = H(ξ).

6

Then, the principal symbol of B = (PAP S, σ(I − PAP S) σ∗) is

σ0(̺ (I − PAP S) ̺∗) = H(−ξ).

b(x; ξ) = (H(ξ), H(−ξ))

and satisﬁes

rank(b(x; ξ) q(x; ξ)) = rank(q(x; ξ))

∀ξ 6= 0.

Functional determinants

For the case of local boundary conditions (as in the boundaryless case), the estimates of Seeley [13] allow one to
B, as an integral operator with continuous kernel Jz(x, t; y, s) (and, consequently,

express the complex powers of DB, Dz
of trace class) for Re(z) < −ν.

As a function of z,

can be extended to a meromorphic function in the whole complex plane C [21], with only simple poles at z = j −ν, j =
0, 1, 2, ... and vanishing residues for z = 0, 1, 2, ...

So, in this case, a regularized determinant of DB can then be deﬁned as

ζ(DB )(−z) ≡ T r(Dz

B)

Det (DB) = exp[−

T r (Dz

B)]|z=0.

d
dz

This determinant can also be expressed in terms of the Green’s function of the elliptic boundary value problem, as in
[11,12].

But, as far as we know, the construction of complex powers for elliptic boundary problems with global boundary

conditions is still under study [22]. So, for the global case, one can not use the previous deﬁnition.

In the following we present the complete evaluation of the determinant of the Dirac operator on a disk, in the
presence of an axially symmetric Abelian ﬂux and under spectral boundary conditions, in terms of the corresponding
Green’s function.

DIRAC OPERATOR ON A DISK WITH GLOBAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

We will evaluate the determinant of the operator D = i 6∂+ 6A acting on functions deﬁned on a two dimensional

disk of radius R, under APS boundary conditions.

We consider an Abelian gauge ﬁeld in the Lorentz gauge, Aµ = ǫµν ∂νφ (ǫ01 = −ǫ10 = 1), with φ a smooth bounded

function φ = φ(r); then

The ﬂux through the disk is

Notice that the operator so deﬁned, which we call (D)κ, turns out to be self adjoint.

Our aim is to compute the quotient of the determinants of the operators (D)κ and (i 6 ∂)κ=0. Since the global

boundary condition in Eq. (55) is not a continuous function of the ﬂux Φ, we will proceed in two steps:

In the ﬁrst step, where there is no change of boundary conditions, we can grow the gauge ﬁeld by varying α from 0
to 1 in

(D)κ → (i 6 ∂)κ → (i 6 ∂)κ=0.

Dα = i 6 ∂ + α 6A = e−αγ5φ(r) i 6 ∂ e−αγ5φ(r),

thus going smoothly from the free to the full Dirac operator. The explicit knowledge of the Green’s function will allow
us to perform the calculation of this step, where we will use a gauge invariant point splitting regularization of the
α-derivative of the determinant. The second step will be achieved by using a ζ-function regularization, after explicitly
computing the spectra.

There is an additional complication, since these global boundary conditions give rise to the presence of |k + 1|

linearly independent zero modes. For k > 0, these normalized eigenvectors are given by

where X = x0 + ix1 = reiθ, and the normalization factors are

For k < 1 we get similar expressions, with the opposite chirality. Notice that, for k = −1 (in particular, when Φ = 0),
there is no zero mode.

For simplicity, in the following we will consider only the case k ≥ −1. The kernel of the orthogonal projector on

Ker(Dα)κ, Pα is given by

As usual, the kernel of the operator inside the trace is singular at the diagonal, so we must introduce a regularization.
We will employ a point-splitting one where, following Schwinger [24], we will introduce a phase factor in order to
preserve gauge invariance. We thus get,

Notice that when there are no zero modes (k + 1 = 0) only the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. survives.

In the following, we will obtain the second quotient of determinants in Eq. (64) by computing explicitly the spectra

of the free Dirac operators and using a ζ-function regularization.

For n ≥ k + 1 the corresponding eigenvalues are λ = ±jn,l/R ( jn,l is the l-th zero of Jn(z)). Analogously, for n ≤ k,
λ = ±jn+1,l/R. Notice that j−n,l = jn,l, and that, for n = k +1 the eigenvalues appear twice, once for an eigenfunction
with vanishing upper component at the boundary, and once for another one with vanishing lower component.

For ℜ(s) large enough, we can construct the ζ-function of ( 6i∂ + P0)κ as [23]

The ﬁrst term, |k + 1|, is just the multiplicity of the 0-eigenvalue of (i 6 ∂)κ. It is also interesting to note that the
double sum in the r.h.s. (which is independent of k) corresponds to the ζ-function of the Laplacian on a disk with
Dirichlet (local) boundary conditions, thus being analytic at s = 0 [21].
It is easy to verify that the analytic extension of the second sum,

is regular at s = 0. Then ζ(i6∂+P0)κ(s) is regular at the origin. This is interesting since, as far us we know, the
regularity of the ζ-function at the origin for non local boundary conditions has not been established in general [22].

In the framework of this regularization, we thus get

where N+(−) is the number of positive(negative) chirality zero modes.

It can be veriﬁed that our strategy leads to the correct result for this index. By following the same procedure that
lead to Eq. (80), we can compute the quotient of determinants in the l.h.s of (82). In fact, taking into account that
the inverse of the transformed operator is given by

G(ǫ)

α (x, y) = (1 − Pα) Gα(x, y) (1 − Pα) + eγ5ǫ Pα eγ5ǫ,

the only diﬀerence appears in the ﬁrst term of the r.h.s. of (75), where a factor e±2ǫs arises. Thus, after performing
the ǫ-derivative

[26]. The second one is the boundary contribution of APS, shifted by 1/2. This correction, due to the presence of the
factor ̺ in (51), has already been obtained in [27] with slightly diﬀerent spectral boundary conditions.

CONCLUSIONS

We have achieved the complete evaluation of the determinant of the Dirac operator on a disk, in the presence of

an axially symmetric ﬂux, under global boundary conditions of the type intoduced by Atiyah, Patodi and Singer.

To this end, we have proceeded in two steps: In the ﬁrst place, we have grown the gauge ﬁeld while keeping the
boundary condition ﬁxed. This calculation was possible thanks to the exact knowledge of the zero modes and the
Green’s function (in the complement of the null space.) Here, a gauge invariant point splitting regularization was
employed.

In the second step, we have explicitly obtained the eigenvalues of (i 6 ∂ +P0)κ. We have shown that the corresponding
ζ-function is regular at the origin and we have evaluated the quotient of the free Dirac operators for two diﬀerent
global boundary conditions.

We have veriﬁed that our complete result is in agreement with the APS index theorem.

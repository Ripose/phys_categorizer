ABSTRACT  We  investigate  the  problem  of  polymer  translocation  through  a 

nanopore  in  the  absence  of  an  external  driving  force.  To  this  end,  we  use  the 

two-dimensional  (2D)  fluctuating  bond  model  with  single-segment  Monte  Carlo 

moves. To overcome the entropic barrier without artificial restrictions, we consider a 

polymer which is initially placed in the middle of the pore, and study the escape time 

τ  required  for  the  polymer  to  completely  exit  the  pore  on  either  end.  We  find 

numerically  that τ  scales  with  the  chain  length  N  as τ  ∼Ν 1+2ν,  where  ν  is  the  Flory 

exponent. This is the same scaling as predicted for the translocation time of a polymer 

which  passes  through  the  nanopore  in  one  direction  only.  We  examine  the  interplay 

between the pore length L and the radius of gyration Rg. For L<<Rg, we numerically 

verify  that  asymptotically  τ  ∼Ν 1+2ν.   For  L>>Rg,  we  find  τ ∼Ν.  In  addition,  we 

numerically  find  the  scaling  function  describing  crossover  between  short  and  long 

pores. We also show that τ  has a minimum as a function of L for longer chains when 

the  radius  of  gyration  along  the  pore  direction,  R(cid:38) ≈L.  Finally,  we  demonstrate  that 

the  stiffness  of  the  polymer  does  not  change  the  scaling  behavior  of  translocation 

dynamics for single-segment dynamics.

I. Introduction 

The  translocation  of  biopolymers  through  nanometer-scale  pores  is  one  of  the 

most crucial processes in biology, such as DNA and RNA translocation across nuclear 

pores, protein transport through membrane channels, and virus injection.1-3 Moreover, 

translocation  processes  might  eventually  prove  useful  in  various  technological 

applications,  such  as  rapid  DNA  sequencing,4-5  gene  therapy  and  controlled  drug 

delivery,  etc.6  In  addition  to  its  biological  relevance,  the  translocation  dynamics  is 

also  a  challenging  topic  in  polymer  physics.  Accordingly,  the  polymer  translocation 

has attracted a considerable number of experimental,7-14 theoretical15-28 and numerical 

studies.29-36

The translocation of a polymer through a nanopore faces a large entropic barrier 

due to the loss of a great number of available configurations. In order to overcome the 

barrier  and  to  speed  up  the  translocation,  an  external  field  or  interaction  is  often 

introduced.  The  possible  driving  mechanisms  include  an  external  electric  field,  a 

chemical  potential  difference,  or  selective  adsorption  on  one  side  of  the  membrane. 

For  example,  in  1996,  Kasianowicz  et  al.7  reported  that  an  electric  field  can  drive 

single-stranded DNA and RNA molecules through the α-hemolysin channel of inside 

diameter 2 nm and that the passage of each molecule is signaled by the blockade in 

the channel current. 

Inspired  by  the  experiments,7  a  number  of  recent  theories15-28  have  been 

developed  for  the  dynamics  of  polymer  translocation.  Even  without  an  external 

2

driving force, polymer translocation remains a challenging problem. To this end, Park 

and  Sung16  and  Muthukumar19  considered  equilibrium  entropy  of  the  polymer  as  a 

function  of  the  position  of  the  polymer  through  the  nanopore.  The  geometric 

restriction leads to an entropic barrier. Standard Kramer analysis of diffusion through 

this entropic barrier yields a scaling prediction of the translocation time 

τ ∼

tran N

2

for 

long chains. However, as Chuang et al.

23 noted, this quadratic scaling behavior is at 

best  only  marginal  for  phantom  polymers  and  cannot  be  correct  for  a  self-avoiding 

polymer. The reason is that the equilibration time 

τ ∼

and

+

  for  a  self-avoiding  polymer,  where  ν  is  the  Flory  exponent 

(ν = 3/4 and  3/5  in  2D  and  3D,  respectively).  Thus  the  exponent  for 

equilτ   is  larger 

than  two  for  self-avoiding  polymers,  implying  that  the  translocation  time  is  shorter 

than the equilibration time of a long chain, thus rendering the concept of equilibrium 

entropy  and  the  ensuing  entropic  barrier  inappropriate  for  the  study  of  translocation 

dynamics. Chuang et al.23 performed numerical simulations with Rouse dynamics for 

a  2D  lattice  model  to  study  the  translocation  for  both  phantom  and  self-avoiding 

polymers.  They  decoupled  the  translocation  dynamics  from  the  diffusion  dynamics 

outside the pore by imposing the artificial restriction that the first monomer, which is 

initially  placed  in  the  pore,  is  never  allowed  to  cross  back  out  of  the  pore,  see 

Fig.1(a).23  We  will  refer  to  the  translocation  time  obtained  this  way  as 

tranτ .Their 

results  show  that  for  large  N,  translocation  time 

tranτ   scales  approximately  in  the 

same manner as equilibration time, but with a larger prefactor. 

In  the  present  work  we  consider  a  polymer  which  is  initially  placed 

 

3

symmetrically  in  the  middle  of  the  pore,  as  in  Fig.1(b).  In  this  case,  without  any 

external driving force or restriction, the polymer escapes from the hole either to the 

left or the right side of the pore in an average time defined as the escape time τ.37 It is 

clear  that 

tranτ   and  τ  are  different.  Namely,  the  translocation  time 

tranτ   includes 

events  where  the  middle  segment  reaches  the  center  of  the  pore  but  then  the  first 

segment returns to the entrance of the pore and the whole translocation process begins 

all  over  again.  Numerically,  τ  can  be  sampled  much  more  efficiently  than 

tranτ , 

leading  to  a  more  accurate  determination  of  the  scaling  behavior.  We  will  show 

numerically that τ ∼Ν 1+2ν, in the same manner as found previously for 

tranτ . Recently, 

Wolterrink  et  al28  have  studied  the  translocation  dynamics  scaling  for  a  3D  lattice 

model  of  a  polymer.  They  have  also  found  that τ  scales  as τ  ∼Ν 1+2ν ,  in  agreement 

with the present work. 

In this study, we investigate the translocation dynamics in a 2D lattice model by 

focusing on τ. In particular, we investigate the effect of varying the pore length on the 

polymer translocation. The dependence of the translocation dynamics on the stiffness 

of  the  polymer  is  also  considered.  The  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  In  Sec.  II  we 

introduce the fluctuating bond model. In Sec. III using our approach we examine the 

polymer  translocation  through  short  and  long  pores.  We  obtain  very  accurate 

estimates  for  the  scaling  exponents  as  a  function  of  N  and  find  the  scaling  function 

describing crossover between short and long pores. Our results are summarized in Sec. 

II. The Fluctuating Bond Model

The  fluctuating  bond  (FB)  model38  combined  with  single-segment  Monte  Carlo 

(MC)  moves  has  been  shown  to  provide  an  efficient  way  to  study  many  static  and 

dynamic  properties  of  polymers.  Here  we  use  the  2D  lattice  FB  model  for  MC 

simulations of a self-avoiding polymer, where each segment excludes four nearest and 

next nearest neighbor sites on a square lattice. The bond lengths bl are allowed to vary 

in  the  range  2

prevents  bonds  from  crossing  each  other.  The  stiffness  of  the  chain  is  controlled

is  the  energy 

difference  between  the  new  and  old  states.  As  to  an  elementary  MC  move,  we 

randomly select a monomer and attempt to move it onto an adjacent lattice site (in a 

randomly  selected  direction). 

If 

the  new  position  does  not  violate 

the 

excluded-volume  or  maximal  bond-length  restrictions,  the  move  is  accepted  or 

rejected according to Metropolis criterion. N elementary moves define one MC time 

step. 

III. Results and Discussion 

1. Polymer translocation through a short nanopore 

In this section, we present the results for the escape time τ for a lattice model of 

polymers.  For  the  same  model,  we  also  studied  the  translocation  time 

tranτ   defined 

 

5

by Chuang et al  23 using the restriction that the first polymer cannot back out of the 

pore. We used the same pore size for both cases (length of L = 3 and width of w = 2 

lattice units). Numerical studies were done for a number of different chain lengths N, 

with several thousand runs for each case. 

In Fig. 2(a) we show the average translocation time 

tranτ   and τ as a function of 

the polymer length N for the case with J = 0. The log-log plot of Fig. 2(a) is shown in 

Fig. 2(b). When N > 16, the results vs. N follows scaling to a good degree of accuracy. 

We  find  that

result is very close to the expected value of 1 + 2ν = 2.5, and in agreement with the 

3D numerical values obtained in Ref. 28.   

  We have also examined τ for a relatively stiff polymer, by setting

J k T   = 5.39 In

Fig.  3  we  show  τ  as  a  function  of  N.  We  find  that

,  which 

confirms that the stiffness of the polymer does not affect the scaling behavior of τ for 

single-segment dynamics. 

2. Polymer translocation through a long pore 

 

Next, we consider the influence of the pore length L on τ. In the simulations, the 

width  of  the  pore  is  chosen  as  W=7.  For  a  successful  passage  through  the  pore  of 

length L, the mass center of the polymer moves a distance of L/2 + Rg, so the time it 

takes can be estimated to be

seen. In Fig. 4(b) we show data for a very long pore with L = 800, which confirms the 

linear scaling behavior.

Using the data in Fig. 4, we plot the scaling function f(x) in Figs. 5(a) and (b). From 

Fig. 5a, we find that f(x) ~ const. for L>>Rg, and in Fig. 5(b) we show the other limit 

on  a  log-log  scale,  confirming  the  predicted  x-2  behavior.  We  note  that  recently, 

Slonkina el al.22 theoretically examined the polymer translocation through a long pore. 

Following  the  approach  of  Sung  and  Park16  and  Muthukumar19,  for  L>Rg 

τ

  in the large L limit.   

A particularly interesting question concerns the influence of the pore length to the 

actual  translocation  dynamics  with  fixed  N.  This  problem  has  been  theoretically 

addressed  by  Muthukumar20  who  investigated  the  free  energy  barrier  and  average 

translocation  time  for  the  movement  of  a  single  Gaussian  chain  from  one  sphere  to 

another larger sphere through pores of different lengths. In Ref. 20, it was found that 

τtran(L) has a minimum for an “optimal” value of L0, where translocation is fastest and 

 

7

a threshold value Lc. This result was explained to be due to interplay between polymer 

entropy and pore-polymer interaction energy. In the first regime where L < Lc , τtran(L) 

first  decreases  and  then  increase  with  L,  the  entopic  barrier  mechanism  dominates 

polymer  translocation.  In  the  other  regime  L  >  Lc  ,  τtran(L)  increases  with  L,  and 

polymer translocation is controlled by the pore-polymer interaction. The existence of 

Lc thus corresponds to an apparent cancellation between the gain in translocation rate 

arising from the entropic part and the loss in the rate associated with the pore-polymer 

interaction. 

In  Fig.6  we  show  our  numerical  data  for  a  fixed  chain  of  length  N  =  51.  Most 

strikingly, our result shows that the two regimes for the dependence of τ on the pore 

length are present here without any explicit pore-polymer interaction potential. Thus, 

the  existence  of  an  optimal  pore  length  is  a  generic  phenomenon  in  polymer 

translocation.  We  find  that  the  “optimal”  value  of  L0  ,  corresponds  to  the  radius  of 

gyration  of  the  polymer  along  the  pore  direction,  R(cid:38) .  The  escape  of  the  polymer 

consists of two steps. In the first step with average duration τ1, one end of the polymer 

reaches an edge of the pore. During the second step of average duration τ2, the other 

end of the polymer reaches this edge of the pore. For L > L0, τ1=τ1 (L) increases with 

L because the polymer has to move a longer distance for increasing L, and τ2=τ2(N) 

depends on the chain length N, but is almost independent of the pore length. Thus the 

total time, τ = τ1(L) + τ2(N), increases with L. For L < L0, τ goes down with increasing 

L. Further support for the existence of an optimal pore length comes from the results 

of Slonkina el al.22 for an ideal polymer where a minimum translocation time occurs 

 

8

at L0 = Na. Our simulation results show that L0 ≈  R(cid:38) , but for narrow enough pore  R(cid:38)  

≈ Na. 

Conclusion 

 

In this paper, the polymer translocation through a nanopore in the absence of an 

external  driving  force  is  examined  both  theoretically  and  numerically.  To  overcome 

the  entropic  barrier,  we  consider  the  translocation  dynamics  of  a  polymer  that  is 

initially placed in the middle of the pore in a symmetric position, instead of using a 

restriction  that  the  first  monomer  is  never  allowed  to  crossing  back  out  of  the  pore. 

Our  numerical  results  show  that  accurate  estimates  for  the  scaling  exponents  of  the 

escape time as a function of N are obtained. Our theory predicts that the length of the 

pore plays a very important role in polymer translocation dynamics. For L<<Rg, the 

escape  time  τ  with  polymer  length  N  satisfies  τ∼Ν1+2ν,  while  for  L>>Rg,  τ∼Ν  is 

observed. We also numerically find the scaling function describing crossover between 

short  and  long  pores  and  show  that τ  has  a  minimum  as  a  function  of  L  for  longer 

chains. In addition, our numerical results show that the stiffness of a polymer does not 

change the scaling behavior of translocation dynamics.

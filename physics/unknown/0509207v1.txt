Sommerfeld introduced the fine-structure constant (α) into physics, while he was taking into 

account the relativistic effects in the theory of the hydrogen atom. Ever since, it has puzzled 

many scientists like Eddington, Dirac, Feynman and others. Here the mysterious fine-

structure constant, α (= λC,H/λdB = 1/137.036 = 2.627/360) is interpreted based on the 

finding that it is close to φ2/360 (= 2.618/360 = 1/137.508), where λC,H, the Compton 

wavelength for hydrogen is a distance equivalent to an arc length on the circumference λdB 

(= 2πaB) of a circle with the Bohr radius (aB) and φ is the Golden ratio, which was recently 

shown to divide the Bohr radius (aB) into two Golden sections at the point of electrical 

neutrality. From the data for the electron (e-) and proton (p+) g-factors, it is found that 

(360/φ2) - α-1 = 2/φ3 = (gp - ge)/(gp + ge), where 360/φ2 = λdB/(λC,H - λC,H,i), λC,H,i = φ2πrµ,H 

and rµ,H is the sum of the intrinsic radii of e- and p+ evaluated from the g-factors and that 

α − φ2/360 = 0.009/360 = λC,H,i/λdB = (1- γ)/γ, the factor for the advance of perihilion in 

Sommerfeld’s theory of the hydrogen atom, where γ is the relativity factor. 

    This world year of physics, WYP 2005, is also concerned with the mystery of the fine-

structure constant (α) which puzzled Feynman [1]: “ ...  is it related to pi or perhaps to the 

base of natural logarithms? Nobody knows. It's one of the greatest damn mysteries of 

physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the

"hand of God" wrote that number, ..." , see Gilson [2a]. α and its relation to the g-factors are 

recently rousing considerable interest [2 - 5]. The constancy (or not) of α defined as 

2πe2/κhc, where e, κ, h and c are respectively, the charge, electric permittivity of free space, 

Planck’s constant and the speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum, is being debated 

mostly in terms of these parameters. The present relation between α and the magnetic 

moment anomalies expressed as a long series of terms [6] is too complicated to 

comprehend. This work investigates α from a different point of view, on observing that it is 

close to φ2/360 (= 1/137.508), where φ is the Golden ratio [7], also called the Divine ratio 

(Feynman thought of π or e!), which was recently found [8,9] to play an important role in 

atomic physics. 

    φ is a mathematical constant which operates in a wide variety of geometrical workings in 

the Universe ranging from mollusks in the sea to the spiral galaxies in the cosmos [7]. 

Geometrically, when the segments a and b of a line of length d are such that (a + b)/a = a/b, 

the ratio a/b = (1 + 51/2)/2 = φ = 1.618033989... , and a (= d/φ) and b (= d/φ2) are called the 

Golden sections. Nature works through the remarkable and unique property of φ that the 

power series, ..., 1/φ2, 1/φ, 1, φ, φ2, φ3, …, is at the same time also a Fibonacci series (0, 1, 1, 

2, 3, 5, 8, etc.), where any Fibonacci number is related to its neighbors as follows: e.g., 3 = 

1 + 2 = 5 – 2.  Thus, φ = (1/φ) + 1 = φ2 – 1. Also, note that φ2/π = 0.833346 ~ (5/6). 

    In the case of a hydrogen atom, which consists of an electron (e-) and a proton (p+) (with 

magnetic moments µe and µp respectively) separated by the Bohr radius aB, it was shown 

recently [8] that the ground state energy (EH) is given by the difference, 

 

EH = (1/2)(e2/κaB) = (1/2)(e2/κ)[(1/aB,p) - (1/aB,e)] = eIH = hνH  

1/aB = (1/aB,p) - (1/aB,e); aB = aB,e + aB,p; (aB,e/aB,p)2 - (aB,e/aB,p) = 1

where IH is the ionization potential of hydrogen, Ie = -e/(κaB,e) and Ip = e/(κaB,p) are the 

component potentials of (e-) and (p+) respectively, νH = c/λH is the frequency of light that 

ionizes hydrogen and λH is the corresponding wavelength. From Eqs. (1b,c), one obtains the 

Golden quadratic equation Eq. (1d) whose positive root is aB,e/aB,p = φ. This shows that aB is 

divided at the point of electrical neutrality Pel into the two Golden sections, aB,e = aB/φ and 

aB,p = aB/φ2 = aB,e - aB/φ3. 

    The above interpretation in terms of the Golden ratio was extended to other atoms and 

further, it was shown [8] that for any two atoms of the same kind, the covalent bond distance 

is the sum of its Golden sections, the larger one being the anionic and the smaller one, the 

cationic radius of the atom. This enabled assignment of ionic radii for atoms, and many 

bond lengths were shown to be additive. E.g., the crystal ionic distances of alkali halides 

could be quantitatively reproduced by adding the respective ionic radii.  

    Since the de Broglie wavelength, λdB (= 2πaB) is equal to the circumference of the circle 

with the radius aB, it is also the sum of the circumferences of two Golden circles, λdB,e = 

2πaB,e = (2πaB)/φ and λdB,p = 2πaB,p = (2πaB)/φ2 with the radii aB,e and aB,p. These are also 

equal to the Golden arc lengths corresponding to the Golden angles, (2π/φ) and (2π/φ2) 

radians or 3600/φ (= 222.492o) and 3600/φ2 (= 137.508o) respectively. Note: 2π radians (= 

2πr/r) are divided into 360 degrees where both the radian and the degree are dimensionless.) 

    α (= 2πe2/κhc = 1/137.036 = 2.627/360) is the ratio of wavelengths, 

 

α = λC,H/λdB = λdB/(λH/2)  

                                                      

(2) 

where λC,H = λC,e + λC,p, the sum of the Compton wavelength shifts for the electron and 

proton, corresponds to an arc length, subtended by a central angle of 360/137.036 = 

2.6270 (= φ2 + 0.009), of the circumference λdB of the circle. Since α = λC,H/λdB = rC,H/aB, it 

 

is the ratio of rC,H (= λC,H/2π), the Compton radius, which is related to the magnetic 

moments and aB, which is associated with the electrical charges of e- and p+. rC,H is given by,  

 

 

 

  

µB + µN = (e/2µH,red)hbar = (ec/2)rC,H                                        

hbar = h/2π = cmerC,e = cmprC,p = cµH,red rC,H                                                                   

µB/rC,e = µN/rC,p = (µB + µN)/rC,H = ec/2                                                                          

(3c)   

                           

where µB = (ec/2)rC,e = (e/2me)hbar is the Bohr magneton and µN = (ec/2)rC,p = (e/2mp)hbar is 

the nuclear magneton, rC,H = rC,e + rC,p, me and mp are the rest masses of the electron and 

proton, respectively, and µH,red = memp/(me + mp) is the reduced mass of hydrogen. Eq. (3c) 

shows that the magnetic pole strength is ec/2.  

    The g-factor (ge/2) for the electron is defined as the ratio µe/µB, and is given by, 

µe = (ge/2)µB = (1 + ae)µB = µB + µe,intr = (ec/2)Rµ,e 

ge/2 = Rµ,e/rC,e = (c/hbar)meRµ,e = Iµ,e/I                                            

where µe,intr = aeµB = (ec/2)rµ,e can be considered as the intrinsic magnetic moment of the 

electron, rµ,e is the intrinsic radius, ae = rµ,e/rC,e, is the electron magnetic moment anomaly 

[6b] and Rµ,e = rC,e + rµ,e. Eq. (4b) shows that ge/2 is the ratio of the moments Iµ,e = meRµ,e 

(due to the magnetic moment) and I = hbar/c.  

    Similarly, µN and µp are related by gp/2 as shown,  

µp = (gp/2)µN = (1 + ap)µN = µN + µp,intr = (ec/2)Rµ,p 

gp/2 = Rµ,p/rC,p = (c/hbar)mpRµ,p = Iµ,p/I

where µp,intr = apµN = (ec/2)rµ,p is the intrinsic magnetic moment of the proton, rµ,p is the 

intrinsic radius, ap = rµ,p/rC,p is the proton magnetic moment anomaly and Rµ,p = rC,p + rµ,p. 

Eq. (5b) shows that gp/2 is proportional to the moment, Iµ,p = mpRµ,p.  

   On dividing aB into the sections aµ,e and aµ,p at a point, Pµ [8,9] such that the moments of 

inertia (due to the magnetic moments), Iµ,eaµ,e = Iµ,paµ,p, one obtains,  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Iµ,e/Iµ,p = meRµ,e/mpRµ,p = meµe/mpµp = aµ,p/aµ,e = ge/gp = 0.3585 

                             (6a) 

(aµ,e - aµ,p)/aB = (gp – ge)/(ge + gp) = 2/φ3 =  2(aB,e - aB,p)/aB = 360/φ2 - α-1                             

(6b) 

In Eq. (6b), use of the data from [6c] for the g-factors gives (gp – ge)/(ge + gp) = 0.472 = 2/φ3 

and therefore, ge/gp = (φ3 – 2)/(φ3 + 2); see also [9].  

    From Eqs. (2) and (4) - (6), one finds that 360/φ2 stands for the ratio,  

360/φ2 = λdB/(λC,H - λC,H,i)                                

   (7)         

where, λC,H,i = φ2πrµ,H and rµ,H = rµ,e + rµ,p. The distances, λC,H, (λC,H - λC,H,i) and λC,H,i 

correspond to small arc lengths on the circle of circumference λdB, subtended by central 

angles of 2.6270, 2.6180 (= φ2) and 0.0090 (= 2.627 - 2.618) respectively. 

    On noting that 0.0090 = 360(1 - γ)/γ = 0.009(6)0, the advance of the perihelion in 

Sommerfeld’s theory [10] of the hydrogen atom, where γ = (1- α2)1/2 = 0.99997(3) is the 

relativity factor when the angular momentum p = hbar, one obtains the following relations, 

λC,H,i/λdB = α − φ2/360 = (1 - γ)/γ and γ = λdB/(λdB + λC,H,i) = 0.99997(5)                        

(8a,b) 

Thus the Golden ratio provides a quantitative link between the various known quantities in

atomic physics.

Figure 1. The Golden ratio, point of electrical neutrality (Pel) and magnetic center (Pµ)  of 

the hydrogen atom.  

    AB = aΒ (= 5.29465x10-11m, from the data in [6c]), the Bohr radius, is the distance 

between the electron (e-) with magnetic moments µe at A and proton (p+) with magnetic 

moments µp at B, and O is the center of AB. The (auxiliary) right-angled triangle ABC is 

constructed for locating the point of electrical neutrality, Pel, such that BC = BO = aB/2 = 

CD. This makes, AC = √5aB/2 and AD = aB/φ, where φ = 1.618034. Pel is then marked on 

AB so that APel = AD = aB/φ = aB,e and BPel = aB,p = aB/φ2.  

    EA = APel = aB/φ = 0.618aB and BG = BPel = aB/φ2 = 0.382aB. F is the center of EG (= 

2aB) and 2FO = 2OPel = FPel = (aB,e - aB,p) = aB/φ3 = 0.236aB, The circumference of the 

circle EHGJE with F as the center = 2πaB = λdB, the de Broglie wavelength. The Golden 

angles HFJ = 360/φ2 (= 137.5080) and 360/φ (= 222.4920). The Golden arcs HGJ = (2π/φ2)aB 

= λdB,p and HEJ = (2π/φ)aB = λdB,e. Note that a common tangent to these two circles from a 

point beyond G (not shown in Fig. 1), will be inclined to AB at an angle sin-1(aB,e - aB,p)/aB = 

sin-1(1/φ3). 

    Pµ, the magnetic center, is located such that (ge/gp) = aµ,p/aµ,e, 2PelPµ = FPel = aB/φ3, APµ = 

aµ,e = aB/2 + (aB/φ3) = (φ3 + 2)/2φ3 = 0.736aB, BPµ = (ge/gp)aµ,e = aµ,p = aB/2 – (aB/φ3) = (φ3 - 

2)/2φ3 = 0.264aB and (aµ,e - aµ,p)/aB = 2/φ3 = 360/φ2 - α-1. Note: The chord HJ intersects AB 

at I close to Pµ and BI = 0.255aB. 

    The sum of the Compton wavelengths of (e-) and (p+), λC,H (= αλdB), (λC,H - λC,H,i) [= 

(φ2/360)λdB] and λC,H,i {= φ2πrµ,H = (α − φ2/360)λdB = [(1 - γ)/γ]λdB, where rµ,H is the sum of 

the intrinsic radii of (e-) and (p+) and γ is the relativity factor,} correspond to arc lengths, on 

the circle EHGJE of circumference λdB, which subtend at the center F, the angles, 2.627o, 

2.618o (= φ2) and 0.009o respectively.

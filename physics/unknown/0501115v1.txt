Abstract:  

We show that diffraction of electromagnetic radiation (in particular of a visible light) can 

disappear  in  propagation  through  materials  with  periodically  in  space  modulated 

refraction  index,  i.e.  photonic  crystals. In this way the light beams of arbitrary  width can 

propagate  without  diffractive  broadening  and,  equivalently,  arbitrary  light  patterns  can 

propagate without diffractive “smearing”.

Photonic crystals, i.e. the materials with refraction index periodically modulated in space 

on a wavelength scale [1], are well known to  modify the properties of light propagation. 

Photonic  crystals  can  introduce  photonic  band-gaps  in  radiation  spectra,  i.e.  they  can 

serve as light conductors or insulators [2]. P hotonic crystals can modify the dispersion of 

the  light,  i.e.  they  can  significantly  reduce  its  group  velocity  [3]. We  show  in  the  letter 

that  photonic  crystals  can  also  modify  the  diffraction  of  the  light in that  the diffraction 

can vanish in propagation through particularly prepared photonic crystals. 

Diffractive  broadening  of  light  beams  (and  of  wave  envelopes  in  general)  is  a 

fundamental phenomenon limiting the performance of many linear and nonlinear optical 

devices.  Geometrical  interpretation  of  light-  (and  in  general  of  wave-)  diffraction  is  as 

follows:  light  beams  of  arbitrary  shape  can  be  Fourier  decomposed  into  plane  waves, 

which  in  propagation  acquire  phase  shifts  depending  on  their  propagation  angles.  This 

dephasing of the plane wave components results in a diffractive broadening of the light 

beam.  Fig.1.a  illustrates  normal  diffraction  in  propagation  through  homogeneous 

material,  where  the  longitudinal  component  of  the  wave  vector  depends  trivially  on  the 

propagation angle:

or  positive  diffraction  means  that  the  surfaces  of  the  constant  frequency  are  concave  in 

the wave- vector domain

, as illustrated in Fig.1.a.  

It is known, that diffraction can become negative for materials with refractive index 

modulated  in  a  direction  perpendicular  to  the  propagation  direction.  The  negative  

diffraction,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.1.b,  geometrically  means  that  the  surfaces  of  constant 

frequency are convex in wave- vector domain. The negative diffraction was predicted for 

the waves of electromagnetic radiation [4], for acoustic waves [5], and for  matter  waves 

[6].  The  change  of  sign  of  the  diffraction  is  extremely  interesting  for  propagation  in 

nonlinear  materials,  as  resulting  in  a  change  between  nonlinear  self- focusing  and 

defocusing.    

We  show  in  this  letter  that  in  propagation  through  materials  with  refractive  index 

periodically modulated  in two or three spatial dimensions (in two- or three-dimensional 

photonic  crystals)  diffraction  can  vanish 

to  zero  for  particular  frequencies  of

electromagnetic  radiation,  and  for  particular  propagation  angles.  The  expected 

phenomenon is illustrated in Fig.1.c, where the zero diffraction is supposed to occur in a 

particular  point  in  the  wave-vector  domain  where  the  curvature  of  the  surfaces  of 

constant  frequency  becomes  exactly  zero.  Zero  diffraction  physically  means  that  light 

beams of arbitrary  width can propagate without diffractive broadening and, equivalently, 

that arbitrary light structures can propagate without diffractive “smearing”.   

Nondifractive  light  propagation  can  be  expected  in  differently  fabricated  photonic 

crystals with different symmetries of the lattices, and with different shapes of inclusions 

of enhanced (or reduced) refraction index. In this letter we restrict to a simplest case of a 

harmonic photonic crystal  – a material with sinusoidal  modulation of refraction index in 

two-  and  three-  dimensional  space.  Such  harmonic  photonic  crystal  could  be  produced 

e.g.  holographically,  i.e.  by  light  interference  on  a  photorefractive  material  [7]. 

Interference  of  two  (or  four-)  pairs  of  laser  beams  could  result  in  two-  (or  three-) 

dimensional  dynamical  photonic  crystals  as  illustrated  in  Fig.2.  In  the  present  letter  we 

concentrate  on  a  two-dimensional  case,  however  simulations  show  that  the  phenomena 

persist in case of three-dimensions.   

We consider a superposition of two periodic lamellae- like refraction index gratings :

wavelength  of  the  probe  beam  [8].  This  legitimates  paraxial  approximation  for  the 

description of propagation of the probe beams:

. First we perform an analytical study of the propagation of the plane 

waves,  by  expanding  the  electromagnetic  field  into  a  set  of  spatially  harmonic  (Bloch) 

modes. Then we prove the nondifractive propagation by a direct numerical integration of 

wave equation (1).  

The technique of our harmonic expansion is analogous to expansion in finite set of 

Bloch  modes,  as  e.g.  described  in  [9].  We  include  5  most  relevant  harmonics  in  the 

expansion (respectively 9 modes for three-dimensional case):

The transversal dispersion relation (the dependence of the longitudinal component 

IIk   on  the  transverse  component  k ^

  of  the  wave-vector)  can  be  calculated  from  (3), 

however  the expression  is  too  complicated  for  analytical  interpretation.  The  numerical 

plots  of  transverse  dispersion  relation  are  given  in  Fig.3.  In  the  absence  of  refractive 

index modulation 

0=m

 the formal solution of (3) consist of a set of parabolas (dashed 

curves in Fig.3.a) shifted by the vectors of photonic crystal lattice 

2,1q  one with respect 

to  another.  These  parabolas  represent  the  transverse  dispersion  curves  for  uncoupled 

harmonic components of the expansion (1). We note that in nonparaxial description of the 

light propagation these parabolas would be substituted by  circles. The modulation of the 

refractive index 

0„m

 lifts the degeneracy at the crossing points and gives rise to band -

gaps in spatial wave- number domain (Fig.3.a). We focus however in this letter not in the 

appearance of the band- gaps, but rather on appearance of platoes of transverse dispersion 

curves,  indicating  the  vanishing  of  diffraction.  Numerical  solution  of  (3)  yields  that  the 

curvature  of  the  spatial  dispersion  curve  become  exactly  zero  at  some  set  of  points  in

geometry of photonic crystal given by vectors

Fig.3.b.  Among  the  five  dispersion  branches,  the  upper  one  can  become  nondifractive,

normalized

the photonic crystal. Fig.4 shows the zero diffraction regimes in the space of normalized 

parameters

. The purely nondifractive regime can be obtained on a curve, i.e. on 

the  area  of  a  measure  one  in  the  two-dimensional parameter space.  The  strength  of  the 

effect,  which  is  proportional  to  the  size  of  the  nondifractive  area  in  the  spatial  wave -

number domain, depends strongly on the location along the zero diffraction line, as insets 

of Fig.4 indicate.  

An analytical form of the zero diffraction curve is in general complicated. A simple 

asymptotical  expression  can  be,  however,  found  in  a  limit  of  weak  refractive  index 

modulation 

1<<f

,  when  only  three  harmonics  of  the  harmonic  expansion  (2)  are 

relevant: the homogeneous one, and those with 

 (three upper parabolas in Fig.3.a).

matching with the numerically calculated curve in Fig.4 in the limit 

1<<f

.  

We  checked  the  above  predicted  phenomenon  of  nondifractive  propagation  by 

direct  numerical  integration  of  the  equation  for  the  light  wave  propagation  (1)  for  two- 

and  three-dimensional  modulation  of  refractive  index.  The  results  for  two-dimensional 

case  are  shown  in  Fig.5.  The  integration  results  in  a  evidence  of  the  suppression  of  the 

diffractive  spreading  of  a  narrow  probe  beam:  whereas  in  the  absence  of  spatial 

modulation of the refractive index the light beam is diffractively broadening (Fig.5.a), in 

the  presence  of  refraction  index  grating  of  particular  parameters   the  spreading  was 

strongly suppressed (Fig.5.b). The used set of parameters (f,Q||)=(0.28, 0.57) lies close to 

analytically calculated  zero dispersion curve  of Fig.4, and are chosen in  order to obtain a 

diffraction minimum for the Gaussian envelope [10]. The magnified part of nondifractive 

propagation plot (Fig.5.e) indicates that the nondifractively propagating beam is in fact an 

envelope  of  the  spatially  modulated  nondifractive  propagation  mode.  We  note  that  our 

calculations  in  three-dimensional  case  result  in  essentially  the  same  nondifractive 

behavior as in two-dimensional cases shown in Fig.5.   

As  diffraction  (the  curvature  of  the  dispersion  curve)  becomes  exactly  zero  on  a 

curve  in  wave-number  domain  then,  strictly  speaking,  nondifractive  propagation  has  a 

sense for infinitely broad beams only. Spatial Fourier spectrum of beams of finite width 

occupies an extended area in a wave-vector space (indicated area in Fig.1.c), where the 

dephasing of spatial Fourier components, being not strictly zero, remains negligibly small

  because  of  symmetry,  then  the  fourth  order  derivative  (fourth  order

Concluding,  we  predict  the  nondifractive  broadening  of  electromagnetic  radiation 

in  propagation  through  photonic  crystals.  We  calculate  the  parameters  of  photonic 

crystal,  and  we  evaluate  the  limits  of  nondifractive  propagation.  The  limits  of 

nondifractive  propagation  depend  on  the  higher  order  (predominantly  fourth  order-) 

diffraction, i.e. depend on the position on the zero diffraction curve in parameter space.

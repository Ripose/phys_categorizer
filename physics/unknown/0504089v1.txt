Abstract

The concept (cid:147)Classical Electromagnetism(cid:148) in the title of the paper here refers to a
theory  built  on  three  foundations:  relativity  principles,  the  original  Maxwell(cid:146)s
equations  and  the  mathematics  of  exterior  calculus.  In  this  theory  of  electro-
magnetism the general laws are expressed  as geometric (coordinate-free) relations
between quantities on a four-dimensional spacetime manifold. Based on these laws,
and exterior calculus on metric spaces, we derive fields and relations that describe
electromagnetism  from  the  inside  perspective  of  Lorentz  observers,  inside  the
Minkowski  spacetime  (the  ordinary  flat  spacetime).  It  is  shown  how  fields  and
relations  defined  on  the  spacetime  are  sliced  into  three-dimensional  fields  and
relations on time slices, and that Lorentz observers perceive these as time-dependent
fields  and  relations  on  a  single  three-dimensional  Euclidean  space.  In  exterior
calculus (on metric spaces) each field is associated to four field variants from which
one  can  choose  how  a  field  is  to  appear.  Using this  feature,  we  derive alternative
equation systems describing electromagnetism  from the  inside perspective. In  one
system,  A, all  field quantities are  form fields. In another  system, C, the  fields are
represented as vector and scalar fields. But in contrast to the traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s
equations with div and curl operators, there is here no need for pseudo-vectors and
pseudo-scalars. Some theorems of a pseudo-free vector analysis, adapted to the C-
system, are derived. The paper concludes with a section where we analyse properties
of the electromagnetic field and its laws with respect to mirror transformations.

1. INTRODUCTION

The concept (cid:147)Classical Electromagnetism(cid:148) in the title of the paper refers to a theory built on three foundations:
relativity principles, the original Maxwell(cid:146)s equations and the mathematics of exterior calculus. 
According to the relativity principle of general covariance, the fundamental descriptions of the physical world are
in the form of geometric (coordinate-free) relations between quantities on a general four-dimensional spacetime
arena. This is the outside perspective (or (cid:147)bird perspective(cid:148)) on physics, because the physical reality can be said
to  be  viewed,  by  an  imaginary  observer,  from  outside  of  space  and  time.  Mathematically,  spacetime  is
characterized as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold and the physical quantities as tensors and tensor fields defined on
the manifold.
Differential geometry is a mathematical theory for the study of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds (metric spaces) and
its tensors. Exterior calculus is a theory for completely antisymmetric tensors, and because - as will also be shown
in the paper - all (basic) electromagnetic quantities can be described by completely antisymmetric tensor fields,
exterior calculus is ideal to use in order to mathematically describe electromagnetism. However, it is not quite
enough  to  only  use  exterior  calculus  because  the  metric  concept  is  missing  in  that  theory.  Therefore  the
mathematical theory used in the paper is exterior calculus applied on metric spaces, i.e. spaces which have a metric
tensor defined on them. The Appendix gives a summary of exterior calculus concepts, notations and relations that
are used in the paper. References for the content of Appendix have been [7] and [8] in the reference list, which
also refers to some papers, and two books, dealing with electromagnetic theory in differential-form formalism.
The outside perspective gives a complete overview of electromagnetism for all kinds of spacetimes. From this
perspective  the  laws  are  geometric  (coordinate-free)  relations  between  field  quantities  on  a  general  four-
dimensional spacetime manifold. Electromagnetic fields defined on spacetime will be denoted by the letter F, and
its source fields by J. (Later on we will also include a source field 
, representing magnetic charges and currents.)
A field, of some kind, is a quantity that is defined in all points of a space, and as is shown further on, both F and
J have an own set of four field variants from which one can choose how the fields are to appear. The laws can be
obtained  by  expressing  (selected  parts  of)  Maxwell(cid:146)s  original  equations  in  geometric  form  on  the  spacetime
manifold.  The  general  laws  are  thus  a  generalization  of  Maxwell(cid:146)s  original  equations  into  four-dimensional
spacetime, brought about by relativity principles and the mathematics of exterior calculus. 
Based on these laws, and by using exterior calculus, we derive fields and relations that describe electromagnetism
from the inside perspective of Lorentz observers, situated inside the Minkowski spacetime (i.e. the ordinary flat
{
spacetime). Basic to the derivation is a slicing of the spacetime manifold M, into a continuous set, 
, of three-

Instead of a single spacetime manifold on which the electromagnetic field F and its source field J are defined, we
have a set of three-dimensional spaces on which one must find three-dimensional fields that can represent the four-

two sets denoted

identical metrical properties. Therefore, as will be shown, all fields can be (cid:147)mathematically transferred(cid:148) to a single
Euclidean space by a straightforward procedure. Considered in this way, the four-dimensional fields F and J have
been decomposed into four sequences of three-dimensional fields on one Euclidean space.

According to the standard view, this (cid:147)journey(cid:148) is perceived by the observers as a passage of the time 
three-dimensional  Euclidean  space,  and  where  things  change  with  this  time.  Thus,  from  the  observers  inside
perspective, the sliced parts of the electromagnetic field on the different slices, are described as two time-varying
, on one three-dimensional Euclidean space. In a corresponding way, the source field J is described
fields, 
as the time-varying fields 
 on the same space. These four time-dependent fields correspond to just
mentioned (cid:147)mathematically transferred(cid:148) sequences. 
j
Up to now the field quantities F, J, 
 have not been assigned a field type. An important aspect in
the paper is that to each of these six quantities there are four field variants from which one can choose how the
fields are to appear. The fields of  exterior calculus  are p-form fields  and p-vector fields, i.e. completely  anti-
symmetric tensor fields of type (0/p) and (p/0), respectively. The rank p can take on the integer values 0 up to n,
where n is the dimension of the space on which the field is defined. 0-vector fields and 0-form fields are the same
as scalar fields and 1-vector fields the same as vector fields. Due to the antisymmetry, the number of independent
components for a p-form or p-vector is equal to 
. It follows from this formula that p-vectors, p-
forms, (n-p)-forms and (n-p)-vectors have the same number of independent components, and therefore one can
find four one-to-one mappings between these variants of field. The mappings are of two kinds: index raising and
index  lowering  transformations  and  two  sorts  of  dual  transformations,  and  they  are  defined  from  the  metric,
including the volume measure, of the manifold (see Appendix). Index raising and index lowering operators map
p-forms into p-vectors and vice versa. Dual operators map p-forms into (n-p)-vectors and p-vectors into (n-p)-
forms.
Consequently,  each  field  is  associated  to  a  set  of  four  field  variants.  For  example,  the  four-dimensional
electromagnetic field F can appear as a 2-form field 
 (where the star is a label and
not  an  operator),  as  a  2-vector  field 
.  (These  fields  have  six  independent
and  as  another  2-vector  field 
components.) A tilde over a letter denotes a p-form of some rank, and a bar over a letter indicates a p-vector. Thus
with these conventions, which are one standard, one can not tell the rank of the p-form or p-vector. On three-
dimensional spaces we will use the convention that 2-forms are indicated by double tilde signs and 2-vectors by
ω
double bar signs. A single tilde therefore indicates a 1-form, apart from the volume-form 
 (which is a 3-form),
. As an example of field variants on the three-
and a single bar means a vector (1-vector), apart from the 3-vector

It can be pointed out here that we consider tensors as linear operators which operate on vectors and 1-forms. For

Fields  represented  as  1-forms  and  2-forms  in  the  A-system,  correspond  to  Maxwell(cid:146)s  two  types  of  vector
quantities, (cid:147)intensity vectors(cid:148) and (cid:147)flux vectors(cid:148). Here the two variants of field, the 1-form field and the 2-form
field,  follow  automatically  in  the  derivation  of  the  A-system.  An  explanation  to  the  connections  between
Maxwell(cid:146)s two types of vector and the 1-form and 2-form is given in section 3B.
Because we have four options to represent a field, the A-system can be transformed - with the aid of index raising
or index lowering operators and two variants of dual operators - into other systems where the fields are represented

but  in  the  C-system  there  is  no  need  for  introducing  the  concepts  pseudo-vector  and  pseudo-scalar  as  in  the
traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s equations. The reason pseudo-quantities must be used is an insufficient definition of the curl
operator (and also of the cross product). When the curl operator operates on a vector field the result is a pseudo-
vector field, which can have different coordinate transformation properties than a vector field. This is in contrast

d transforms the 1-form field into a 2-form field and 
 transforms the 2-form field into a vector field. Some
theorems of a pseudo-free vector analysis, adapted to the C-system, are derived in section 3C. The operators of
this vector analysis are composed of exterior calculus operators, and the metric tensor, and correspond to the
operators div, curl, cross product and scalar product of the traditional vector analysis.
The C-system is derived from the general four-dimensional electromagnetic laws, it has no pseudo-quantities and
it is a part of a unified theory of classical electromagnetism, schematically described by Figure 1. Therefore it is
a more basic and rigorous system compared to the traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s equations with div and curl operators.

2. OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE ON CLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETISM

Seen from the outside perspective a particle(cid:146)s (cid:147)journey(cid:148) through spacetime is described by its world line. This line
can be characterized by a continuous set of spacetime points (events), denoted P(τ), where the parameter τ is the

A classical electromagnetic field may be described as an (cid:147)agent(cid:148) which operates (acts) on electrically charged
particles, characterized by their charge Q, rest mass

vectors and 1-forms. For example, a (0/2)-tensor 
 can operate on two vector arguments resulting in real
numbers. If it operates on a single vector, one (cid:147)slot(cid:148) is left open, which means that the result of A operating on a
vector is a (0/1)-tensor, i.e. a 1-form. It is then plausible that the action of an electromagnetic field on a charged
particle can be described by the relation

denoted 
respectively, and two kinds of dual operators, both denoted by a star, see Appendix for
definitions.  Figure  2  shows  the  different  variants  of  field,  and  the  transformations  between  these,  for  an

These  relations  are  recognized  as  (one  of  several  variants  of)  Maxwell(cid:146)s  equations.  For  example,  the  last six
equations, with the current equal to zero, are identical to the relations used by A. Einstein in his paper of 1905,
(cid:147)On the Electrodynamics of moving Bodies(cid:147), where the quantities X, Y, Z are described as the components of the
electric force vector and L, M, N as the components of the magnetic force vector. If a source field is included then

density vector. But none of these vectors are relevant when characterizing electromagnetism from the outside
perspective. In the next section we derive some equation systems describing the laws of electromagnetism from
the inside perspective, and in one of the systems the laws are relations between three-dimensional vector fields
and scalar fields.
According to the principle of general covariance, in the most general and fundamental description of the physical
world  the  laws  are  geometric  (coordinate-free)  relations  between  quantities  defined  on  a  four-dimensional
spacetime. In this section we started from two such coordinate-free relations, 
, where fields
and operators are defined on a general four-dimensional spacetime. It was shown that for a Minkowski spacetime
with Lorentz coordinates, these relations lead to eight connections between four-dimensional field components,
and that the connections are (a variant of) Maxwell(cid:146)s original equations. Hence, using the principle of general
covariance, it follows that 
 are the general laws of classical electromagnetism. If we apply
a dual operation on both sides of these relations, and use relation (71) in Appendix, we can also express the laws as

3. INSIDE PERSPECTIVES ON CLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETISM

Mathematically, a Minkowski spacetime is defined as a metric manifold (metric space) in which it is possible to

Cartesian coordinates x, y, z. Therefore the coordinate vector basis 
 forms a four-
dimensional vector basis, and the dual basis 
 a four-dimensional 1-form basis. The notations
∂ ∂x⁄
 can consequently mean three-dimensional vector and 1-form fields defined on
the ordinary Euclidean space, or four-dimensional fields defined on the Minkowski spacetime. 
The parallel transported coordinate grids span three-dimensional subspaces, called time slices, denoted

We  note  that  this  way  of  slicing  spacetime  is  connected  to  Lorentz  observers  whose  world  lines  are  the 
-
coordinate lines. Other Lorentz observers (in constant relative motion) follow other straight world lines which can
be  used to  define  alternative  time-coordinate  lines,  and  other  sets  of  time  slices, 
  by
Lorentz transformations. (It is also possible to slice the Minkowski spacetime into curved slices which are related
to accelerating observers. But in this paper such cases are not considered.)

But in a similar way as the four-dimensional electromagnetic field can appear as different field variants, the three-
dimensional E- and H-field have four field variants from which one can choose in order to represent the fields. On
three-dimensional spaces, 1-forms, 2-forms, vectors and 2-vectors have three independent components. An E-
field  or  a  H-field  therefore  appears  as  a  1-form  field,  a  2-form  field,  a  vector  field  or  a  2-vector  field.  The

which was earlier derived, these four relations describe the laws of classical electromagnetism from the inside
perspective of a Lorentz observer inside the Minkowski spacetime.
In  Maxwell(cid:146)s  (cid:147)A  Treatise  on  Electricity  and  Magnetism(cid:147),  he  uses  the  concepts  (cid:147)intensity  vectors(cid:148)  and  (cid:147)flux
vectors(cid:148) for electrical quantities that he considers are natural to define with reference to line segments and area
segments respectively. He also points out that there are cases where a quantity can be defined with reference to
line segments as well as with reference to area segments. In the equation system (31) 1-form fields correspond to
intensity vectors and 2-form fields to flux vectors. Here these types of field follow automatically in the derivation
of the equation system. Because a 1-form is an operator with one (cid:147)slot(cid:148) for a vector argument, and the vector can

 and 

be considered as a directed line segment, we can say the 1-form is defined from its responses to directed line
segments. A 2-form is an operator on two vector arguments, and because the two vectors can form a parallelogram
area, see Figure 6A, a 2-form can be said to be defined from its responses to directed area segments. 
A typical flux quantity according to Maxwell is the current density, and fully in line with this the current density
 be two small vectors (where
in (31) appears as a 2-form

If we apply (35) to the first relation in (31), we get the result that the current flux plus the time derivative of the
E-field  flux  through  a  surface,  is  equal  to  the  line  integral  of  the  H-field  along  the  boundary  to  that  surface.
Applying (36) to the second relation in (31) gives the result that the E-field flux out through a closed surface is
equal to the charge inside the surface multiplied by the velocity of light.
Of  course  there  are  a  lot  more  to  describe  about  the  equation  system  (31)  and  about  electromagnetism  in
differential-form notation, than what is done here. See the reference list which gives some examples of references
dealing with electromagnetism in differential-form notation.

different variants for the E- and H-field. Also the current density field has the same set of field variants, while the
charge density can appear as a 3-form, a 3-vector or a scalar (which is the same as a 0-form and 0-vector). Because
a 3-form on a three-dimensional space has one independent component, the charge density field represented as a

 is the volume-form. As follows

See Figure 1 which gives an overview of the different equation systems that have been derived. The operator 
operates on vector fields, resulting in scalar fields, and the operator 
 operates on vector fields, resulting in
other vector fields. Therefore the E- and H-field of the C-system are vector fields of the same sort, which is quite
natural because there are only one sort of vector fields in exterior calculus. The reason for pointing this out is that
in the traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s equations, with div and curl operators, the electric field and the magnetic field are
described by vectors of different sorts. The electric field vector is a (cid:147)true(cid:148) vector whereas the magnetic field vector
is a (cid:147)pseudo(cid:148) vector. One also has to use true scalar fields and pseudo-scalar fields. The need for introducing these
pseudo concepts, depends on an insufficient definition of the curl operator. If the curl operator operates on a vector
field the result is a pseudo-vector field. Such fields do not transform in the same way as true vector fields for basis
transformations  containing  a  change  in  the  handedness  of  the  basis  system.  In  the  next  section,  on  mirror
transformations and mirror symmetry, these questions are touched on somewhat further.

This corresponds to the traditional theorem that a curl operation followed by a div operation is equal to zero. 
A commonly used operation in traditional vector theory is the cross product between vectors or pseudo-vectors.
If the cross product operates on two vectors the result is a pseudo-vector. If it operates on a vector and a pseudo-
vector the result is a vector. We now define a corresponding operation between two vectors, denoted 
, with
no pseudo-quantities involved (and thus adapted to the C-system):

With the aid of (44), (42) and the C-system in (39) a Poynting relation for the C-system can be obtained.
Hence, a set of theorems can be derived using the operator definitions in (40) and (43). These theorems form a
, and the scalar product, that corresponds to the traditional vector
vector analysis with the operators 
analysis with div, curl, cross product and scalar product, but is pseudo-free and adapted to the C-system. 
The C-system is derived from the general four-dimensional electromagnetic laws, it has no pseudo-quantities, and
it is a part of a unified theory of classical electromagnetism, schematically described by Figure 1. Therefore it is
a more basic and rigorous system compared to the traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s equations with div and curl operators.

transformations. The analyse will include four-dimensional fields and laws on the Minkowski spacetime, but we

The relations for other p-forms and p-vectors are clear from the rules above. The definitions are also, essentially,
valid for fields on the Minkowski spacetime. We just have to add a time coordinate and change the Latin indices
into Greek indices. 
If a field and its mirror field are equal, i.e. 
 where K denotes an arbitrary type of field, then the field
is mirror symmetric with respect to the mirror plane. Such a field is an eigenfield of the mirror operator, with
eigenvalue  +1,  and is said  to have  parity +1. If we  have 
,  the field has  parity -1 and  is an  anti-
symmetric field.
With  the  aid  of  the  definitions  above  for  the  mirror  operator,  the  definitions  in  Appendix  for  the  exterior
derivative, the dual operators and the index raising operator, the following commutation relations can be shown
to apply:

Because

From the outside perspective the electromagnetic field is represented either as the 2-form

4. SUMMARY
This paper has dealt with a theory of classical electromagnetism built on relativity principles, Maxwell(cid:146)s original
equations and the mathematics of exterior calculus. It is a theory that encompasses both the outside and inside
perspectives on electromagnetism. 
The outside perspective gives a complete overview of electromagnetism for all kinds of spacetimes. From this
perspective the laws are geometric (coordinate-free) relations on a general four-dimensional spacetime. The laws
are  obtained  by  applying  the  principle  of  general  covariance  and  exterior  calculus  on  Maxwell(cid:146)s  original
equations. In section 2 the outside perspective was briefly described. 
In section 3, which is the central part of the paper, the perspective was narrowed into the perspective of non-
accelerating observers inside the ordinary flat spacetime. Based on the general laws, exterior calculus and a slicing
of the Minkowski spacetime, we derived fields and equation systems that describe electromagnetism from the
perspective of Lorentz observers, inside the Minkowski spacetime. In the primary equation system, A, all fields
in the relations are time-dependent form fields. For example, the current density field is represented as a 2-form
jx0
.  If  it  operates  on  two  small  vectors,  the  current  flux  through  the  parallelogram  formed  by  the  vectors  is
obtained. Using  the operator  notion of  2-forms and 1-forms  the connections to Maxwell(cid:146)s (cid:147)flux vectors(cid:148)  and
(cid:147)intensity vectors(cid:148) was explained. 
Since a field of exterior calculus (on metric spaces) is associated to four field variants, the equation system A can
be transformed into other systems, where the fields are represented in alternative ways. In the C-system the fields
appear as vector and scalar fields. But there is no need of introducing the concepts pseudo-vector and pseudo-
scalar as in the traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s equations with div and curl operators. The C-system is derived from the
general  laws  and  is  a  part of  a  unified  theory  of  electromagnetism  encompassing  both  the  outside and  inside
perspectives. Because of this it is a more basic and rigorous system than the traditional Maxwell(cid:146)s equations. The
curl and div operators in the traditional equations correspond to the derived operators

The paper was concluded with a section on mirror transformations and mirror symmetry. The analysis was built
on a set of commutation relations between the mirror operator and exterior calculus operators, including the index
raising operator. Using these relations and a definition of a mirror symmetric electromagnetic field we derived
some relations describing mirror properties of different field quantities.

6. APPENDIX. Some exterior calculus concepts, relations and notations

This section gives a summary description of exterior calculus concepts, relations and notations that are used in the
paper. References have been [7] and [8] in the reference list. Many of the concepts described are not specific for
exterior  calculus  but  belong  to  the  wider  theory  of  differential  geometry.  Some  such  concepts  are  spaces,
coordinates,  vectors  and  1-forms.  We also  describe  the  metric  concept  which is  a  pure  differential  geometric
concept and does not belong to exterior calculus.
Manifolds, spaces and coordinates. Apart from this section, the manifolds of interest in the paper either represent
the ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space or four-dimensional spacetime, but here we consider manifolds
with  arbitrary  dimensions.  Without  using  a  very  strict  mathematical  definition,  we  describe  a  manifold  as  a
collection of points (objects) where each point, P, can be mapped to a real n-tuple 
 in a
one-to-one manner. n is the dimension of the manifold, and the numbers in the n-tuple are the coordinates of P in
the coordinate system which defines the mapping between points and n-tuples. (In general it is not possible to
cover the whole manifold with one coordinate system and also fulfil the criteria of a one-to-one mapping.) Most
often  the  dependence  of  P  is  dropped  and  the  coordinates  are  denoted 
,  where  i  =  1,  2,  .  .  .  .  . n.  In  four-
dimensional spacetime we use the standard convention that coordinates have Greek indices which run from 0 to
3, and where index 0 denotes the time coordinate. But in this Appendix (with two exceptions) we use Latin indices
ranging from 1 to n. 
If the manifold satisfies a (cid:147)smoothness(cid:148) criteria we have a differentiable manifold, which according to reference
[8] is the mathematically precise substitute for the word space. All the manifolds considered in this paper are such
manifolds,  and  therefore  we  will  use  manifold,  differentiable  manifold  and  space  as  synonymous  concepts.
Furthermore,  all  the  spaces  (manifolds)  considered  in  the  paper  have  a  metric  tensor  defined  on  them.
Differentiable manifolds with a metric tensor are called pseudo-Riemannian manifolds or, equivalently, metric
spaces.
Vectors and vector fields. We assume the curve 
f be a function that is defined on the manifold. Along the curve we then have a function

thus consider tensors as linear operators which operate on vectors and 1-forms, resulting in real numbers. A bar

The  antisymmetry  means  that  the  value  of  the  tensor,  when  operating  on  the  arguments,  changes  sign  on
interchange of any two arguments. A 1-vector is the same as a vector and 0-vectors and 0-forms the same as
scalars. A p-form field or p-vector field is a rule for determining a p-form or p-vector at each point of the manifold
(space)  on  which  the  tensors  are  defined. (But  often  we  will  use  the  designation  p-form,  p-vector  and  tensor
instead of p-form field, p-vector field and tensor field.) The different types of tensors do not belong to the manifold

Index  and  summation  conventions.  Components  of  (p/0)-tensors  have  the  indices  written  as  superscript,  and
components of (0/p)-tensors have subscripted indices. Members of vector basis are labelled with subscripts, and
those of 1-form basis with superscript. When an expression contains a repeated index, once as subscript and once
as superscript, a summation over the index is understood. By using these conventions, the fields in (56) and (57)
are expressed as:

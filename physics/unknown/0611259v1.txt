1.   INTRODUCTION  

length  and 

Open-cell  porous  materials  are  widely  used  as  acoustic 
absorbent media in the transport industry. In order to have a 
prior  knowledge  of  their  acoustic  behaviour,  different 
models have been developed [1-4]. Among all these models, 
the Johnson-Champoux-Allard [2, 4] is widely used because 
of  it  simplicity  and  accuracy.  This  model  uses  five 
parameters 
resistivity, 
(open  porosity,  static  airflow 
thermal 
tortuosity,  viscous  characteristic 
characteristic length) which describe the internal structure of 
porous  materials  at 
the  macroscopic  scale.  Different 
methods have been developed in order to characterize those 
parameters.  Some  of  them  are  based  on  the  physical  and 
mathematical  definition  of  the  parameters.  However,  these 
methods,  qualified  as  direct  methods,  require  dedicated 
equipments. The second approach is based on the acoustical 
model  from  which  analytical  expressions  linking  the 
material parameters to acoustical measurements are derived. 
The methods using this approach are qualified as analytical 
inversion  or  indirect  methods.  Finally,  the  last  approach  is 
based  on  an  optimisation  problem  where  the  material 
parameters  are  adjusted  in  the  acoustic  model  to  reproduce 
acoustical  measurements.  The  methods  of  this  group  are 
qualified as inverse methods.  
 
In this paper, three samples of metal foam are characterized 
using direct, indirect and inverse methods.  The objective is 
to  highlight  that  the  methods  may  yield  large  variability  in 
the found parameters.  A discussion is given to explain the 
observed variability and the limitations of the methods. 
 
2.  CHARACTERIZATION METHODS 

Direct measurement of the open porosity is performed using 
the Archimedes principle following the in-air missing mass 
method  [5].  This  method  gives  a  direct  measured  value  of 
open  porosity  through  measurement  of  sample  weight  in 
vacuum  and  in  air,  and  predicts  the  measurement  error.  In 
this study, because of the lack of material, the three samples 
will  be  put  together  (as  one  sample)  to  satisfied  the 
minimum  material  volume  required  by  the  method.    The 
direct method used to measure the static airflow resistivity is 
based on the method proposed by Stinson & Daigle [6]. 

The indirect method (IM) used in this work is based on the 
technique developed by Panneton & Olny [7,8].  Assuming 
dynamic density, dynamic bulk modulus, and open porosity 

known,  analytical  solutions  are  used  to  determine  the 
static  airflow  resistivity,  tortuosity,  viscous  characteristic 
dimension  (VCD),  and  thermal  characteristic  dimension 
(TCD) of the material.   
 
The  inverse  method  is  based  on  an  optimization  problem 
where  unknown  parameters  are  adjusted  to  fit  measured 
acoustic  data  (ex.:  sound  absorption  coefficient)  [9].  This 
method  is  first  applied  to  find  the  tortuosity  and  the  two 
characteristic  lengths  by  assuming  porosity  and  static 
resistivity  known  from  direct  measurements.    Second,  the 
algorithm  is  applied  to  find  simultaneously  the  five 
parameters assuming that none of the parameters are known. 
The  acoustical  measurements  required  for  the  indirect  and 
inverse  methods  were  obtained  using  an  impedance  tube 
following ASTM E 1050 and ISO 10534-2 standards. 
 
3.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The  dimensions  of  the  samples  are  summarized  in  table  1. 
Direct measured porosity is 0.89±0.03. Using this value, the 
four  other  parameters  obtained  from  indirect  method  are 
summarized in table 2. In general, the parameters values are 
in  good  agreement  from  one  sample  to  another  and  the 
deviation from mean values are acceptable. The deviation of 
tortuosity  and  characteristics  length  may  appear  a  little  bit 
high,  but  since  these  parameters  are  difficult  to  measure 
with  an  accurate  precision,  these  deviations are  acceptable. 
Table  3  shows  that  the  method  yields  stable  results  inside 
the  accepted  values  of  porosity,  and  finally,  the  static 
airflow resistivity given by this method fits well with those 
measured  directly  (table  4).  Using  the  directly  measured 
porosity  and  mean  value  of  airflow  resistivity,  the  three-
parameter 
results 
summarized in table 5. As the indirect method, the results fit 
quite  well  from  one  sample  to  another  and  this  method 
yields  stable  results  inside  the  accepted  values  of  porosity 
(table  6)  and  airflow  resistivity  (table  7),  but  seems  to 
depend on frequencies range (table 8). In term of behaviour, 
the  five-parameter  inverse  method  (5-PIM)  yields  similar 
results as the three-parameter method (see tables 9 and  10). 
 
Table 11 presents a comparison of the results obtained from 
the  different  methods.  We  observe  a  significant  difference 
between the porosity value giving by the direct and inverse 
methods.  Moreover,  the  airflow  resistivity  obtained  by 
inverse  method  seems  to  be  over  estimated.    Finally,  the 

inverse  method 

(3-PIM)  yields 

results  of  the  3-PIM  and  IM  compare  well;  however  they 
diverge slightly from those giving by the 5-PIM. As 3-PIM 
and  5-PIM  rely  only  on  acoustical  measurements,  their 
accuracy  exclusively  depends  on 
their  quality  and 
reproducibility. Usually because of experimental conditions 
(room temperature, sample fixing, etc), those measurements 
present  a  small  deviations.    The  5-PIM  may  be  strongly 
vulnerable  to  those  deviations  and  this  may  explain  its 
variability. The two other methods (3-PIM and IM) are also 
affected  by  acoustical  measurement  deviations  (this  may 
explain their small variability), but less strongly than the 5-
PIM  since  they  use  some  known  parameters.  Furthermore, 
because both indirect and inverse methods rely on acoustical 
measurements, they are less accurate than the direct method. 
Finally,  since  both  are  based  on  the  Johnson-Champoux-
Allard model which supposes a motionless frame, they may 
yield wrong parameters when this condition is not satisfied. 
These  results  support  the  need  of:  1)  developing  non-
acoustical  and  direct  methods  (mainly  for  tortuosity  and 
characteristic  lengths),  or  2)  developing  more  accurate 
measurements  in  impedance  tube  for  inverse  and  indirect 
characterization purposes.

Development of the Concept 

A  comprehensive  description  of  stochastic  cooling  has  been  given  in  the  classic 
paper  of  Mohl,  Petrucci,  Thorndahl,  and  van  der  Meer.1    This  paper  has  served  as  the 
basic reference for stochastic cooling, and contains all of the important results, except for 
a  detailed  theory  of  bunched  beam  cooling.    A  fundamentally  different  theoretical 
approach  that  yields  essentially  the  same  results  has  been  given  by  Bisognano.2    Other 
early  work  includes  Derbenev  and  Kheifets,3  Hereward,4  Katayama,5  Palmer,6  and 
Sacherer.7  A number of authors have summarized the field from various points of view 
including Caspers,8,9 Mohl,10 and Marriner.11   

Stochastic Cooling Concepts 

The  general  idea  of  stochastic  cooling  is  to  sample  a  particle’s  motion  with  a 
pickup  and  to  correct  the  motion  with  a  kicker.    Stochastic  cooling  is  similar  to  other 
beam  feedback  systems  used  on  accelerators,  except  that  the  stochastic  cooling  system 
works  on  individual  (incoherent)  particle  amplitudes,  not  the  (coherent)  motion  of  the 
beam as a whole.  No stochastic cooling system is able to resolve individual particles in a 
single sample, but after a sufficiently long time (the cooling time) each particle develops 
its own dissipation (damping) force in a sea of much larger signals from the sum of all 
the other particles.  The key point is that every particle has a slightly different frequency 
of motion, and the force generated by all the other particles has a random phase and thus 
averages  to  zero.    The  net  result  is  that  cooling  of  each  particle  can  be  described  by  a 
damping force, which is created by the particle and is linear in the system feedback gain, 
and the heating force, which is created by all the other particles and averages to zero to 
first  order  in  the  feedback  gain  but  causes  particle  diffusion  proportional  to  the  gain 
squared.    A  more  detailed,  pedagogical  explanation  of  the  principles  can  be  found  in 
Marriner and McGinnis12 or Mohl.13

Transverse Cooling 

Transverse cooling is achieved by sensing the particle displacements in the pickup 
and  applying  a  correcting  signal  at  the  kicker.    Normally,  the  pickup  and  kicker  are 
placed ninety degrees apart in betatron phase so that a position displacement at the pickup 
will become an angular displacement at the kicker.  A simplified schematic of the process 
is shown in Figure 1.

Filters can be, and have been, used in transverse systems to cool beams.  The filter 
stores  the  beam  signal  and  corrections  are  made  in  subsequent  turns  with  the  correct 
phase.  The phase response of the filter can be used to compensate for a pickup to kicker 
phase advance that differs from 90º.  One implementation used for the FNAL Debuncher 
had  notches  at  multiples  of  half  the  revolution  frequency  and  eliminated  the  revolution 
harmonic  signal  (from  incomplete  common  mode  rejection)  and  half  the  thermal  noise.  
In this case, the betatron sideband phase was unaffected because the filter phase shift was 
zero at the Schottky sidebands (the fractional tune was near ¼). 

Momentum Cooling 

There are two basic types of momentum cooling.  One technique was suggested 
by Robert Palmer and is often referred to as Palmer cooling.  This technique relies on the 
correlation between position and momentum in regions of high dispersion.  A difference 
pickup  makes  a  zero  in  the  gain  function  at  some  momentum  where  the  beam 
accumulates.  The kicker is usually placed in a zero dispersion region, and equally kicks 
beam particles of all momenta.  Since beam particles exhibit a long-term response only to 
excitations at their individual revolution frequencies, there is no disadvantage to having 
the kicker in zero dispersion. 

Another  technique,  known  as  filter  cooling,14  relies  on  the  correlation  between 
revolution frequency and momentum.  In this technique a pickup that is equally sensitive 
to  all  beam  particles  is  used,  but  a  zero  in  the  electronic  gain  is  necessary  at  each 
Schottky  band.    The  zeros  are  produced  with  a  notch  filter  that  has  a  period  precisely 
equal to the target revolution frequency.  The system is built so that the real part of the 
gain changes sign around the notch frequency, as is required for cooling. 

Palmer cooling is advantageous because it avoids the extra phase shifts of notch 
filters,  an  important  advantage  when  the  Schottky  bands  are  wide.    Filter  cooling  is 
advantageous in low noise situations because it notches the thermal noise as well as the 
Schottky  signal.    Palmer  systems  are  generally  more  stable,  a  critical  factor  for  high 
dynamic range stacking systems. 

Another  technique,  which  is  sometimes  called  transit  time  cooling,  is  a  special 
case  of  filter  cooling.    It  is  based  on  using  the  “bad  mixing”  or  transit  time  effect  to 
change  the  sign  of  the  real  part  of  the  gain  function  around  the  particle  revolution 
frequency.    Under  normal  conditions,  the  transit  time  effect  changes  the  sign  of  the 
imaginary part of the gain.  However, if a 90° phase shift is inserted—by differentiation 
of  the  gain  function,  for  example—a  cooling  effect  may  be  obtained.    Transit  time 
cooling, however, does not provide any advantage compared to Palmer or filter cooling 
except possibly for easier implementation.  

Stochastic Cooling Implementations 

The first practical cooling system was demonstrated at the ISR.15,16  Early R&D 
work was done in storage rings dedicated to that purpose:  ICE17 at CERN and the 200 
MeV electron cooling ring (ECR) at FNAL.18,19  The R&D proved the stochastic cooling 
technique  –  particularly  the  critical  demonstration  of  simultaneous  stochastic  beam 
cooling in all three planes – and enabled the confident construction of the CERN AA20,21 
and  later  the  two-ring  Fermilab  antiproton  source  including  the  Debuncher22  and  the 
Accumulator23 Rings.  The ACOL ring was later added to the CERN antiproton source24 
and  the  Fermilab  Debuncher  cooling  system  bandwidth  was  increased.25    Other  early 
experimental cooling systems included TARN26 and NAP-M.27  

Low  energy  antiproton  systems  were  developed  for  the  ISR28  and  the  dedicated 
storage  ring  LEAR.29,30,31    The  ISR  antiproton  program  was  continued  at  the  Fermilab 
Accumulator.  The Antiproton Decelerator32 (AD) was later built at CERN as a low-cost 
successor  to  LEAR.    More  recently  there  has  been  an  interest  in  applying  stochastic 
cooling  techniques  to  the  proton  and  heavy  ion  beams  in  the  medium  energy  region  at 
COSY33,34 and ESR.35,36 

A  summary  of  the  major  stochastic  cooling  systems  is  shown  in  Table  1.    In 
general, one sees applications to improve source brightness and accumulate particles and 
also  to  improve  the  rate  of  beam  interaction  with  a  target.    Many  of  the  systems  have 
been modified several times in a way that is difficult to capture in a simple table.  The 
references should be consulted for the details. 

Bunched Beam Cooling 

The theory of bunched beam cooling was developed in a comprehensive way by 
Bisognano  and  Chattopadhyay.37,38    Bunched  beam  cooling  has  been  successfully 
demonstrated in the Fermilab Accumulator.39  More Recently, cooling of a beam captured 

in a barrier bucket has been demonstrated at the Recycler Ring at Fermilab.40  However, 
attempts to extend the technique to high-energy colliding beams at the CERN Sp pS41 and 
the  Fermilab  Tevatron42  have  not  proven  successful.    A  summary  of  the  problems 
associated with bunched beam cooling has been given by Caspers and Mohl.43  As these 
authors noted, a major problem is that bunched beams tend to show unexpectedly large 
coherence  at  microwave  frequencies.    This  coherence  appears  to  be  a  collective  self-
bunching of the beam.  A serious effort is underway to develop the technique at RHIC44,45 
where coherent effects seem to be less severe.

The rate of cooling depends on the cooling system bandwidth.  The bandwidth is 
limited by its highest frequency:  the highest frequency utilized to date is 8 GHz.  Aside 
from technological issues, a complicating factor is that the beam pipe aperture tends to be 
comparable  to  the  wavelength  at  high  frequencies,  implying  that  the  pickup  and  kicker 
structures  as  well  as  the  beam  pipe  itself  support  many  electromagnetic  modes.    It 
appears to be fairly easy to absorb energy traveling in the beam pipe: an early example 
was reported by Barry.46 The pickup and kicker design problem has not been fully solved 
although  there  has  been  a  lot  of  work  on  differing  approaches.    The  most  promising 
application for very high frequency systems, namely high-energy accelerators where the 
beam  size  is  small,  has  been  stalled  because  these  applications  involve  the  problematic 
cooling of bunched beams. 

There  has  been  significant  interest  in  developing  stochastic  cooling  at  optical 
frequencies to obtain a bandwidth of perhaps 10,000 GHz.47  However, a practical system 
has not yet been demonstrated. 

Power Sources & Limitations 

Stochastic  cooling  systems  require  broadband  power  amplifiers  at  power  levels 
ranging from Watts to 1000’s of Watts.  Solid state amplifiers have been used routinely 
for  frequencies  below  1  GHz.    The  CERN  ACOL  project  developed  high  power  solid 
state  amplifiers48  specifically  for  the  3  stochastic  cooling  bands  in  the  1  to  3  GHz 
frequency  range.    Traveling  wave  tubes49  (TWT’s)  have  been  used  for  high  power 
applications in the 1 to 8 GHz band, most extensively at FNAL. 

The performance of some stochastic cooling systems is limited by the total power 
available, not by the system bandwidth.  This situation has been analyzed by Goldberg, et 
al.,50 who suggest that higher pickup sensitivity can be more important in these cases than 
an increase in bandwidth. 

Pickup Technologies 

A wide variety of pickup designs have been used in stochastic cooling systems.  A 
general  description  of  pickup  and  kicker  principles  has  been  given  by  Goldberg  and 
Lambertson.51    Realistic  designs  have  generally  been  optimized  for  varying  beam 
energies,  beam  apertures,  and  other  local  considerations.    However,  pickups  can  be 
divided into two general categories. 

Phased arrays 

Phased  arrays  consist  of  many  individual  pickups  of  relatively  low  impedance.  
The  outputs  of  a  series  (up  to  100’s)  of  pickups  are  added  to  achieve  the  desired 
sensitivity.    The  mostly  widely  used  structure  is  a  stripline  (also  known  as  a  “loop”) 
pickup.  These pickups are generally constructed from a plate placed parallel to the beam 
and  the  vacuum  chamber  with  connections  at  the  upstream  and  downstream  end  of  the 
plate.    Originally  made  from  sheet  metal,52,53  they  can  also  be  made  on  printed  circuit 
boards,54,55,56  which  offer  the  advantage  of  more  economical  construction.    One 
advantage of using a large array of pickups is that it is relatively easy to adapt the array to 
a varying beam velocity. 

Traveling wave structures 

In a traveling wave, the beam induces a wave that travels at the beam velocity and 
grows  as  the  wave  and  the  beam  travel  the  length  of  the  structure.    Maintaining 
synchronism  between  the  beam  and  the  traveling  wave  results  in  a  tradeoff  between 
bandwidth and sensitivity in these devices.  The signals from traveling wave pickups can 
be added, but often a single unit has enough sensitivity.  Relatively tight constraints on 
synchronism make it difficult to adapt this type of pickup to varying beam velocities. 

Faltin57 developed a slotted transmission line that was used at the ISR and later at 
the  CERN  AA;  McGinnis58  developed  a  somewhat  similar  device  but  based  on  slotted 
waveguide.  Lower velocity pickups using a helical structure were developed for TARN59 
and the FNAL electron cooling ring, where a traveling wave transverse pickup was also 
used. 

Sensitivity calculations 

Calculating the response of pickup and kicker structures from first principles has 
been  a  daunting  task  for  all  but  the  simplest  of  structures.    However,  recent  work  has 
made  significant  progress  towards  reliable  numerical  design  calculations  for  practical 
pickup arrays.60,61,62  It should be noted that the traveling wave structures (references 57 
and 58) are accurately described by semi-analytic models that has been verified by direct 
measurement. 

Cryogenics 

Stochastic  cooling  pickups  are  typically  back-terminated  with  the  characteristic 
system impedance in order to achieve a high bandwidth.  The terminating resistors are a 
source of noise proportional to the resistor temperature (Johnson noise).  This noise can 
be  dramatically  reduced  by  cooling  the  resistors  to  cryogenic  temperatures.    The 
amplifier noise is also generally reduced by cooling.63  Another benefit of cryogenically 
cooling pickups and amplifiers is that the resistance of copper conductors is reduced by 
cooling.    Signal  loss  (though  generally  not  large  even  at  room  temperature),  can  be 
reduced significantly in cryogenically cooled systems. 

Other pickup sensitivity considerations 

The  ability  to  combine  and  split  microwave  signals  without  loss  of  power  is  an 
important  consideration in stochastic cooling systems.  Large phased arrays of pickups, 
especially,  require  an  efficient  power  combiner.64    Since  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  is 
critical  in  many  systems,  some  pickups  have  been  built  with  an  adjustable  gap  that 
decreases in size as the beam cools.65 

Filter Technology 

There have been a number of technical realizations of notch filters suitable for use 
in stochastic cooling.  The realization of stochastic cooling filters is demanding since the 
uniformity of spacing must be high and the notches must be deep. A key element of all 
notch  filters  is  an  element  that  has  a  precise,  frequency  independent  delay  and  a  low 
attenuation.    A  variety  of  circuits  are  possible,  varying  in  technical  complexity  and 
response.66    Many  filters  have  used  low  loss  transmission  lines  as  the  basic  element.  
More  recent  variants  include  the  use  of  novel  delay  elements  in  analog  circuits:  
superconducting  transmission  lines,67  bulk  acoustic  wave  devices,68  and  optical 
fibers.69,70  The optical fiber is implemented by modulating the intensity of a laser with 
the microwave signal, transmitting the signal over an optical fiber, and demodulating the 
light  received.      In  addition  to  analog  techniques,  advances  in  digital  signal  processing 
have  made  it  relatively  easy  to  realize  arbitrarily  complicated  but  very  precise  filters,71 
particularly for the lower frequencies used in stochastic cooling systems. 

Gain 

The gain of a stochastic cooling system is characterized by the real and imaginary 
parts of the beam transfer function (open loop gain) as a function of frequency.  At the 
design  stage  the  gain  is  usually  modeled  as  constant  over  a  given  frequency  band  and 
zero outside this band, although such a gain function cannot be realized in practice.  More 
realistic  gain  functions  have  been  studied  theoretically  by  van  der  Meer.72    In  practice, 
however, cooling systems are built with a target bandwidth and, after the system response 

has  been  measured,  modified  by  the  addition  of  an  equalizer  to  maximize  the  cooling 
rate.73 

System Measurements 

The most important tool for understanding system performance is the open loop 
gain or beam transfer function (BTF) measurement.  The BTF measurement yields a full 
characterization  of  a  linear  system.    The  measurement  is  made  by  breaking  the 
connection between the pickup and kicker at any convenient point.  A network analyzer 
is used to excite the kicker side of the broken connection, while the response is measured 
on  the  pickup  side.    The  response  of  the  beam  can  be  accurately  predicted  by  the 
knowledge  of  a  few  beam  and  lattice  parameters  (beam  energy  and  spread,  transition 
energy,  and  tune)  and  the  response  of  the  system  (complex  gain  as  a  function  of 
frequency)  can  therefore  be  readily  determined.    In  practice,  it  is  unnecessary  to 
determine the beam response:  it is enough to know that the peak responses in different 
Schottky  bands  have  the  same  phase  and  an  amplitude  response  that  is  inversely 
proportional  to  frequency.    Generally,  the  desired  response  is  one  that  is  flat  in  both 
amplitude and phase.  

An example of a BTF measurement from the FNAL Accumulator transverse core 
cooling  system  is  shown  in  Figure  2abcd.    Figure  2ab  shows  the  amplitude  and  phase 
response at a single harmonic (h=4305).  The plots show a characteristic peaking at the 
two betatron sidebands (n±Q) and a rapid change of phase of 180º in the vicinity of the 
resonance.    The  data  (dots)  is  compared  to  the  theoretical  calculations  of  the  beam 
response assuming that the cooling system gain is constant over this Schottky band.  The 
predictions shown are a numerical integration of the Schottky spectrum measured using a 
resonant 79 MHz pickup and a gaussian fit to the same data.  Except for the noisy nature 
of  the  numerical  integration,  the  curves  are  virtually  indistinguishable.    The  wide  band 
response is shown in Figure 2cd.  To make this measurement, the peaks on the betatron 
sidebands are sampled every few Schottky bands, and the response is interpreted in terms 
of the desirability of the stochastic cooling electronic gain function.  One notices that the 
amplitude response is fairly flat over the range of 1600 to 4000 MHz, quite good for this 
nominally 2-4 GHz cooling system.  Figure 2d plots the difference between the measured 
phase and the desired phase of 180º.  The phase is likewise quite flat over this region, but 
the  phase  is  slightly  too  high.    Lengthening  the  system  delay  by  about  10  psec  will  fix 
this problem.  The difference between upper and lower sideband phase is equal to twice 
the error in phase advance.  This error is zero for the measurement shown in Figure 2d. 

Conclusion 

Stochastic  cooling  is  a  mature  subject  that  has  been  successfully  applied  to  the 
problem of creating intense particle sources (most spectacularly for antiprotons) and for 
reducing  beam  size,  especially  in  the  energy  regime  where  electron  cooling  has 
traditionally  been  judged  to  be  impractical  or  at  least  more  difficult.    One  outstanding 
question  is  whether  increases  beyond  the  maximum  achieved  frequency  of  8  GHz  are 
possible  and,  in  particular,  whether  cooling  at  optical  frequencies  will  be  practical.    In 
addition,  the  application  of  stochastic  cooling  to  bunched  beams  in  a  colliding  beam 
accelerator has proved so far to be elusive.  Work on practical techniques has been steady 
especially  in  the  area  of  pickup  and  filter  technology.    Advances  in  microwave 

technology  and  the  application  of  digital  techniques  to  rf  systems  have  also  influenced 
system design. 

New applications of stochastic cooling for ions and modest energy proton beams 
have more recently appeared at COSY and ESR.  It will be interesting to see how these 
and  other  possible  future  applications  utilize  stochastic  cooling  given  potentially 
competing techniques such as higher energy electron cooling.

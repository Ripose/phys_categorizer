Abstract 
 
There  are  several  applications  and  fundamental  research  areas  which  require  the 
detection  of  VUV  light  at  cryogenic  temperatures.  For  these  applications  we  have 
developed  and  successfully  tested  special  designs  of  gaseous  detectors  with  solid 
photocathodes  able  to  operate  at  low  temperatures:  sealed  gaseous  detectors  with 
MgF2 windows and windowless detectors. We have experimentally demonstrated, that 
both  primary  and  secondary  (due  to  the  avalanche  multiplication  inside  liquids) 
scintillation lights could be recorded by photosensitive gaseous detectors. The results 
of  this  work  may  allow  one  to  significantly  improve  the  operation  of  some  noble 
liquid gas TPCs.

I. Introduction 
  
Cryogenic  liquid  gas  TPCs  are  promising  detectors  for  several  applications  and 
fundamental researches. Relevant examples could be the ICARUS experiment [1], the 
nTOF experiment [2], WIMP search LXe/Ar detectors [3], noble liquid gas PETs [4], 
studies  of  cryogenic  plasmas  [5]  and    studies  of  quantum  phenomena  in  liquid  and 
solid  He  [5].  Nowadays,  PMs  are  mostly  used  for  the  detection  of  the  primary 
scintillation light from noble gas liquids (a “start” signal for the TPC). In preliminary 
studies  we  have  shown  that  the  costly  PMs  could  be  replaced  by  gaseous  detectors 
with solid photocathodes placed far away from the volume with noble gas liquids and 
operating  at  room  temperature  [6].  Recently,  we  have  developed  and  successfully 
tested  several  exclusive  designs  of  gaseous  detectors  which  are  able  to  operate  at 
cryogenic temperatures. Their main advantages are their low cost, the large sensitive 
area and their ability to operate in magnetic fields, which is quite necessary for some 
studies.  In  contrast  to  the  previously  used  gaseous  detectors,  the  new  ones  could  be 
placed much closer to the liquids or if necessary, be even immersed into the liquids. 
The aim of this report is to review these new but yet unpublished results. 

 
II. Experimental set up 
 
Two  experimental  set  ups  were  used  in  this  work:  one  oriented  for  work  with 
cooled  gases  and  the  other  one  for  measurements  in  vacuum,  gases  and  tests  with 
noble gas liquids. 

The  firsts  experimental  set  up  is  schematically  presented  in  Fig.1.  It  basically 
consists of a cryostat, inside of which a test vessel was installed. The cryostat could 
be cooled in a controllable way down to 80K. The test vessel was comprised of a gas 
scintillation  chamber  filled  with  noble  gases  (Ar,  Xe  or  Kr)  and  contained  a 
radioactive  source    (241Am,  55Fe  or  90Sr)  inside,  a  gaseous  detector  with  solid 
photocathode  attached  to  the  scintillation  chamber  and  the  PM  (EMI  9426  with  a 
MgF2 window) monitoring the primary scintillation light produced by the radioactive 
sources.  

Two types of photosensitive defectors were constructed, manufactured and tested: 
1) sealed detectors with MgF2 windows and 2) windowless detectors able to operate 
in cooled noble gases (see [7,8] for more details).  In the case of the sealed detectors, 
most  of  the  measurements  were  done  with  a single  wire counter   (a diameter of the 
anode  wire  was  50  µm)  shown  in    Fig.2.  Inside  the  cylindrical  cathode  (35  mm  in 
diameter)  was  a  removable  disc  (30  mm  in  diameter)  coated  with  a  photosensitive 
layer. If necessary, this disc could be independently cooled (see [7] for more details).  
Photosensitive  layers  were  deposited  either  on  the  surface  of  the  disc  (reflective 
photocathode)  or  on  the  MgF2  widow  (semitransparent  photocathode).  Most  of  the 
tests  were  done  with  reflective  CsI,  Sm,  TMAE  and  TMAE+neopentane  (NP) 
photocathodes.  The  procedure  of  deposition  of  these  layers  on  the  cathode’s  disc  is 
described in [7]. Typically, the thickness of the semitransparent CsI layer was 20 nm 
and  the  reflective  one  –  400nm.  The  thicknesses  of  the  other  photosensitive  layers 
was, depending on the conditions, between 0.5 and 2 µm. Sealed detectors were filled, 
depending  on  the  operation’s  temperature,  either  with  a  mixture  of  Ar+10%  CH4  or 
He +(5-10)% H2  at  pressures  of  1atm.  For  the  estimation of the number of detected 
scintillation  photons  Nph,  a  55Fe  source  was  often  used  which  produces  a  known 
number  of  primary  electrons  (see  [6]  for  more  details).  For  the  independent 
measurements of the photocahode’s quantum efficiency (QE) at room temperature a 
calibrated gaseous detector CFM- 3 was used [9]. 

Some measurements were done with Hamamatsu capillary plate (CPs) -see Fig 3. 
The  conventional  CPs  were  made  of  lead  glass  and  had  a  resistivity  between  the 
electrodes  of  >  1010  Ω.  We  also  tested    H2  treated  CPs  which  had  the  resistivity 
between the electrodes of 10-100 MΩ. Both types of CPs had a diameter of 25mm, 
thickness of 0.8 mm and the hole’s diameter of 100 µm  In tests described below the  
CPs were not coated with any photosensitive layer.  

Windowless detectors tested were either a cascade of hole-type detectors (GEM or 
capillary plates[10])  with their (see Fig. 4) or a parallel mesh detector combined with 
a reflective CsI photocathode (Fig.5). The hole-type detector operated in an avalanche 
multiplication mode in the same gas and pressure as the scintillation chamber. In the 
case of GEM its cathode facing the Am source coated with a 0.4 µm thick CsI layer. 
As  was  shown  earlier  [6],  in  this  mode  of  operation  the  QE  is  low  compared  to  the 
detectors with windows. However, the sensitive area of these detectors could be rather 
large and thus the “overall” sensitivity could be reasonably high. This is why it was 
still interesting to investigate windowless detectors at low temperature.  In the case of 
the  mesh  detector,  we  tried  to  explore,  not  the  charge,  but  a  multistep  light 
multiplication. The detector works as follows. Photons from the primary scintillation 
create  n0  primary  electrons  from  the  CsI  cathode.  These  electrons  drift  to  the  space 
between  the  two  meshes  and  produce  n0Aph  secondary  scintillation  photons.  These 
photons in turn create a well separated bunch of secondary electrons in time from the 
cathode, n1= n0Aph ΩQ (where Ω is the solid angle, Q-the photocathode QE) and so 
on  (see  [7,8]).  As  a  result  of  two/three  generations  in  these  processes,  the  charge 
signal  becomes  large  enough  to  be  detected.  This  approach  has  several  important 
advantages over other known methods and we consider it as the most promising one 
for this application. 

The other set up was a chamber which could be immersed to the bath cooled with 
LN2 or other liquids. And if necessary be filled with noble gas liquids as described in 
[7,  11]  –see  Fig.6.  It  allows  several  independent  studies  to  be  made,  for  example: 
operation  of  hole-type  structures  placed  above  the  liquid’s  level,  the  avalanche 
multiplication  inside  the  liquids,  detection  of  the  primary  and  the  secondary 
scintillation  lights  by  a  PM  or  by  a  gaseous  detector  with  solid  photocathodes.  In 
addition,  it  was  possible  to  measure  the  QE  of  these  photocathodes  both  in  the 
vacuum  and  in  a  gas  at  some  temperature  intervals,  including  those,  which 
corresponded to LXe or LAr. For this, a pulsed (a few ns) H2 or a continues Hg lamp 
was  used  with  a  system  of  UV  filters.  The  absolute  intensity  of  the  light  beam  was 
measured with calibrated Hamamatsu vacuum photodiodes and the calibrated SFM-3 
counter  (see  above  and  Fig.7).  Some  measurements  were  also  done  in  the  visible 
region of spectrum.  

 
III. Results 
III-1.Resulst Obtained with the First Set Up 
A) Detectors with windows 
 
The absolute values of the photocathode’s QE were estimated from measurements 
made    at  room  temperature  by  three  methods:  1)  from  the  measurements  of  the 
amplitude of the signal produced by the scintillation light  [6,7] (at very low QE the  
counting  rate  produced  by  single  photoelectrons  was  used  instead  of  the  signal 
amplitude), 2) with respect to the known QE of the SFM-3 counter (see Fig.7 and 3) 
with respect to the known QE of  (ethylferrocene) EF[12] and TMAE vapours (using 
the scintillation light from the noble gases). In the latest case the detector was filled 
with  TMAE  or  EF  [12]  and  the  amplitude  of  the  signal  produced  by  alpha’s 
scintillation was measured with respect to the  55Fe signal. Some measurements were 
done  with  the  pulsed  H2  lamp.  The  results  are  presented  in  Table-1  Note  that  CH4 
mixture  absorbs  the  Ar  scintillation  light  and  thus  a  special  calibration  was  used  to 
correct on this absorption [7] 

At  low  temperatures  we  indirectly  monitored  the  QE  by  measuring  only  the 
scintillation signal produced by the 241Am. During cooling all valves were closed, so 
the gas density was constant.  Fig. 8 shows the signal amplitude vs. temperature for 
the  CsI,  TMAE,  Sm,  and  NP+TMAE  reflective  photocathodes  (in  VUV  and  visible 
regions  of  spectra).  In  these  measurements  special  care  was  done  to  minimize  the 
temperature  gradient  inside  the  detector  which  may  cause  some  undesirable  gain 
variations.  At  temperatures  of  T>120K  the  detector  was  filled  with  Ar+CH4  gas 
mixture. In this gas the detector operated stably at gains of 104-105. At T<120K the 
gas  mixture  was  He+H2.  Our  measurements  show  that  in  this  mixture  due  to  the 

strong  back  diffusion  effect  [13]  the  “practical”  QE  drops,  depending  on  the  gas 
density, by a factor of 5-10 (compared to the Ar+CH4 mixture) and this in turn caused 
a  drop  in  the  signal  amplitude  to  take  place.  This  effect  is  clearly  seen  from  Fig.  8. 
The  other  problem  associated  with  the  He+H2  mixture  was  a  rather  narrow 
proportional region at an elevated gas density, for example at P=1atm and at T=80K: 
the  detector  could  at  gains  of  only  200-500  easily  transit  to  the  streamer  mode  of 
operation. Obviously this was due to the large diameter of the anode wire (see [14] for 
more details).Also note that for the stable operation at T<100K, the inner part of the 
detector and the gas should be very clean, otherwise the impurities could condensate 
on  the  photocathode’s  surfaces  and  created  some  charging  up  effects.  This  also 
concerns the CsI photocathode: it should not be exposed to air and should also be well 
outgased; otherwise some charging up effect is possible. 

The other interesting observation was that in VUV even pure metals (for example, 
Sm  or  Cu)  may  have  high  QE,  however  in  UV  and  visible  region  their  QE  drop 
quickly with temperature. The high QE of metals in the VUV region of spectra allows 
us  to  use  CPs  for  detection  of  the  scintillation  light  without  any  coating  by 
photosensitive layers. These test reveal that conventional CPs could be used without 
any serious problems up to  200 K and H2 treated up to 150K. 

 
 
B)  Windowless detectors 
 
  As  in  the  previous  case,  alpha  particles  were  used  for  QE  monitoring.  With 
windowless  detectors  by  changing  the  polarity  we  were  able  to  measure  either  the 
signal  produced  by  the  scintillation  light  or  the  charge  signal  produced  by  alpha 
particles  in  the  gas.  At  high  gains  55Fe  was  also  used  for  signal’s  calibration.  We 
discovered  that  GEMs  can  work  in  pure  noble  gases  at  T>120  K  (see  also  [15]). 
However,  at  lower  temperatures  a  strong  charging  up  effect  was  observed.  We  also 
discovered  that  at  room  temperature  much  higher  gains  than  with  GEMs    were 
achieved with capillary plates (CPs) operating in pure noble gases. For example gains  
up  to  104 were easily achieved with single CPs as shown in Fig.9  (see  [7]  for  more 
details).  This  is  why  we  mostly  concentrated  on  studies  of  CPs  operations  at  low 
temperatures.  However,  even  the  H2  treated  CPs  exhibited  charging  up  problems 
below 120K.  The other problem, common both for GEMs and CPs, was that the QE 
was  low  compared  to  the  detectors  with  windows  [6].  This  can  also  be  clearly  seen 
from  Fig.  8  in  which  the  plotted  signal  produced  by  the  241Am  scintillation  light  is 
seen.  

By almost a factor of 5 times higher the QE was obtained with the mesh detector–
see  Fig.8  and  [7]  for  more  details.  The  other advantage  of  this  detector  was  that  no 
charging  effect  was  observed  at  any  temperature.  However,  more  studies  still  are 
needed to prove the practical significance of this method. 

 
 
 
 
III.-2 Results with the Second Set Up 
 
As  was  mentioned  above,  the  second  set  up  (see  Fig.6)  allows  one  to  carry  out 
various studies including measurements with noble gas liquids. For example recently, 
photosensitive  gaseous  detectors  were  successfully  used  in  the  detection  of  both  the 
primary  and  the  secondary  (due  to  the  avalanche  multiplication  inside  the  noble 
liquids) scintillation lights [7,8]see Fig 6. This work was in the stream of other efforts 
described in recent papers [11]. In this report however we will present only the results 
of  the  QE  measurements  in  vacuum  and  in  the  gas  at  very  low  temperature  (up  to 
LN2) and mention some studies of the detector’s operation in an avalanche mode. The 
description  of  other  results  can  be  found  in  [7].  In  Table  2  the  results  of  the  QE 
measurements  are  presented  for  a  single  wire  detector  installed  inside  the  test 
chamber. The drop of the QE at 89K in He+H2 gas was, as mentioned above, due to 

the back diffusion. Note that this detector could operate stable at high gains and at any 
temperature, the only bothersome effect was the transition to the streamer’s mode of 
operation  at  temperatures  of  T>100K.  In  contrast,  brief  tests  with  the  hole  type 
detectors  revealed  some  instability  below  150K,  probably  due  to  the  charging  up 
effect or some contacts problems. For example, in a recent attempt to operate GEMs 
placed few cm above LAr surface were not successful.  More studies are necessary to 
clarify the reasons for the detectors failure. .  

 
III.-3.  Estimation of the QE of detectors operating at low temperatures 
 
From  the  data  presented  in  Fig.  8  and  Tables  1,2,    and  using  the  results  of  the 
sensitivity  calibrations,  one  can  estimate  the  QE  of  our  detectors  (see  [7]  for  more 
details).  Results  are  presented  in  Fig  10.  One  can  see  that  the  highest  QE  was 
achieved  with  the  sealed  single  wire  counter.  The  parallel  mesh  detector  or  GEMs 
coated  with  the  CsI  layer  offer  lower  efficiency,  however  they  can  operate  without 
window which could be attractive in some applications. Thus photosensitive gaseous 
detectors could operate at low temperature with a high enough QE. 

 
  
IV. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
We have demonstrated that gaseous detectors with solid photocathode can operate 

stable, depending on designs, up to 150-80K.  

The  best  results  (the  highest  QE,  the  highest  gains  and  good  stability)  were 

obtained with sealed gaseous detectors operating under very clean conditions. 

This  confirmed  our  earlier  results  obtained  with  solid  photocathodes  operating 
inside liquid and solid noble gases [16]. It is especially important that they have the 
ability to operate in magnetic fields. As was described in other papers, one can also 
explore avalanche multiplication inside noble liquids. All these results may allow one 
to  significantly  improve  the  operation  and  sensitivity  of  the  TPCs  and  reduce  their 
cost. Some designed proposed on the basis of these studies are described in [7].

Abstract

I introduce a reality structure on the Heisenberg double of Funq(SL(N, C)) for
q phase, which for N = 2 can be interpreted as the quantum phase space of the
particle on the q-deformed mass-hyperboloid. This construction is closely related
to the q-deformation of the symmetric top. Finally, I conjecture that the above
real form describes zero modes of certain non-compact WZNZ-models.

Introduction

Monodromy matrices representing the braid group [1], appearing in the WZNZ-model,
suggested that hidden quantum groups exist in these theories. Various approaches
were used in an attempt to elucidate the origin of these hidden quantum groups.
In [2, 3, 4, 5] using a Minkowski space-time lattice regularization, it was shown by
explicit construction that the monodromies of the chiral components of the WZNW-
model with Lie group G and the local ﬁeld satisfy the commutation relations of the
q-deformed cotangent bundle T∗Gq.

However an apparent contradiction existed [3, 5], since the deformation parameter
in the WZNW-model must be root of unity q = exp(iπ/k + h), where k is the level of
the aﬃne-Lie algebra and h is the dual Coxeter number, and this is incompatible with
the compact form of the quantum group.

A solution to this problem was proposed in [6]. The main idea is to drop the strong
requirement that the reality structure be compatible with quantum group comultipi-
cation and only impose this requirement in the classical limit. Then a reality structure
can be introduced, but not on the quantum group itself, but rather on the quantum
cotangent bundle.

However once the requirement of the compatibility of the reality structure with
the comultiplication is dropped, one can introduce more than one reality structure. In
this paper I will introduce one such reality structure inspired by a particular type of
non-compact WZNW-model. See for example [7] for a list of various circumstances
under which this non-compact form occurs and also [8] where the non-compact form
of appears as the Euclidean section of the model. These WZNW-models have the
important property that the local ﬁeld has the chiral decomposition g = hh† where h
is the chiral ﬁeld valued in G. Thus g is a Hermitian positive deﬁned matrix of unit
determinant. I will show that

is compatible with the algebra T∗Gq and extend the above anti-involution to the whole
algebra. I emphasize that the reality structure introduced here is similar to the one dis-
cussed in [6] and is not related to the standard non-compact reality structure appearing
in quantum groups for q phase, and which is compatible with comultiplication.

For simplicity here I will not apply the reality structure directly in the WZNW-
model, leaving this for a forthcoming paper, and instead I will just use it for the toy

g† = g

1

model of [5, 6], which essentially contains all the relevant degrees of freedom. These
degrees of freedom are described by the same algebra as in the compact case but with
a diﬀerent reality structure.

In Section 2, I give a short review of the quantum algebra T∗Gq. I discuss the com-
mutation relations for operators generating both left and right translations, since both
forms are necessary to deﬁne or to check the involutions presented in the next sections.
Section 3 brieﬂy covers the reality structure of [6]. In section 4, I present the main re-
sult of the paper, a reality structure corresponding to a generalized mass-hyperboloid
conﬁguration space and its associated q-deformed phase space. In Section 5, I con-
sider the simple quantum mechanical system of [6] and show its compatibility with
the ∗-structure introduced in the previous section. In the last Section I present some
evidence for the relevance of this reality structure to the non-compact WZNW-model.

2 Review of the Algebra on T∗Gq

In this section I present a brief review of the deﬁning relations of the q-deformed
cotangent bundle [5] also known as the Heisenberg double or as the smash product [9,
10]. The main purpose of this section is to ﬁx the notation. I will follow closely the
presentation in [6] where a more detailed exposition can be found.

Let G be the Lie group SL(N, C), and sometimes for simplicity I will take G =
SL(N, 2). Most of the content of the paper can be easily extended to arbitrary classical
groups. Now consider the quantum R+ matrix associated to the Lie group G. This is a
matrix depending on a parameter q and acting in the tensor product of two fundamental
representations. For example the R+ of SL(2, C) is the following 4 × 4 matrix

where λ = q − q−1. It is convenient to also use the R− matrix deﬁned as

R− = P R−1

+ P

(1)

where P is the permutation operator in the tensor space of the two fundamental rep-
resentations

R+ = q−1/2 


q 0 0 0




P (a ⊗ b) = b ⊗ a.

Next I will deﬁne the quantum algebra T∗Gq, the quantum deformation of the cotan-
gent bundle. Let g and Ω± be matrices acting in the fundamental representation of G.
The Ω± matrices are upper and lower triangular matrices. In addition the diagonal
elements of Ω+ equal those of Ω−1
− . T∗Gq is the algebra generated by g and Ω± and
satisfying the following set of relations divided for convenience into three groups

R±g1g2 = g2g1R±

R±Ω1
R±Ω1
R+Ω1
R−Ω1

−.

(3)

(4)

All the above relations are operator matrices acting in the tensor product of two
fundamentals, and the superscript indicates on which factor the respective matrix
acts. The R matrices without any superscript act in both spaces. One can show that
the quantum determinant of the matrices g and Ω± is central and can be set equal to
one

detq(g) = detq(Ω±) = 1.

For the SL(N, C) groups these are all the relations, while for the other classical groups
additional relations, for example orthogonality relations, have to be imposed. Noto also
that, unlike (2)(3), the relation (4) is not homogeneous in R± thus the normalization
of R± is important.

The above relations are not independent. For example the R− relations can be

obtained from the R+ relations using (1) and

X 2 = P X 1P.

(5)

The subalgebra generated by the matrix elements of g with relations (2) is in fact
a Hopf algebra denoted Funq(G) and represents a deformation of the Hopf algebra
of function on the G Lie group [11]. Also, the subalgebra generated by Ω± with

3

relations (3) is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra called the quantum universal enveloping
algebra [12, 13, 11], and is denoted Uq(g) where the g in the brackets is the Lie algebra
of the Lie group G. For example the coproduct of Funq(G) on the matrix elements of
g is given by

where the dot means multiplication in matrix space. Similarly the coproduct in Uq(g)
on the matrix elements Ω± reads

△(g) = g ˙⊗g,

△(Ω±) = Ω± ˙⊗Ω±.

On the other hand T∗Gq is not a Hopf algebra. We emphasize this, since there is
a related algebra, the Drinfeld double, which has the same generators but diﬀerent
mixed relations and is a Hopf algebra.

The mixed relations (4) describe how to combine the above subalgebras into the
larger algebra T∗Gq. They appear as commutation relations in [5, 9, 10] but in an
abstract form as the pairing of dual Hopf algebras they were already present in [11].

One can relate the Ω± with the more traditional Drinfeld-Jimbo generators. For

example for the SL(2, C) group we can write the matrix elements of Ω± as [11]

Ω+ =

 

q−H/2
0

q−1/2λX+
qH/2

!

, Ω− =

qH/2

0

 

−q1/2λX− q−H/2 !

.

(8)

Usinq the R+ matrix above it can be shown by direct computations that the generators
H, X± satisfy the Jimbo-Drinfeld relations [12, 13]

[H, X±] = ±2X±,

[X+, X−] =

qH − q−H
q − q−1

deﬁning the universal enveloping algebra Uq(sl(2, C)). Similar relations also exist for
higher rank groups [11] and can be thought of as connecting the Cartan-Weyl and
Chevalley bases.

It is also convenient to combine Ω± into a single matrix [14]

In terms of these generators all the relations (3) and (4) collapse to

Ω = Ω+Ω−1
− .

Ω1R−1

− Ω2R− = R−1
R−g1Ω2 = Ω2R+g1.

+ Ω2R+Ω1

(7)

(9)

(10)

(11)

These forms of the commutation relations are especially useful when we deal with the
commutation relations only, but the coproduct of Ω cannot in general be given in an
explicit form.

The commutation relations (2)(11) are exactly those satiﬁed by the local ﬁeld and

the monodromy of the left (or right) chiral component of the aﬃne current [2, 3, 4].

Following [6] we also introduce an equivalent description of the quantum algebra

using operators generating right translations. First let

and then introduce a triangular decomposition of Σ into Σ±

similar to the decomposition of Ω into Ω±. One can check that the matrix elements of
Ω and Σ commute. To make the picture more symmetric also introduce a new matrix
h by

Now we can use either pair (g, Ω) or (h, Σ) to describe the algebraT∗Gq.

The deﬁning relations satisﬁed by h and Σ are [6]

In this case the R±

If we require a reality structure for g compatible with the Hopf algebra structure i.e.

△ ◦ ∗ = (∗ ⊗ ∗) ◦ △

and use (15) we obtain a non-compact quantum group. For example if G = SL(N, C)
we obtain Funq(SL(N, R)).

However sometimes in the same application we are interested in the compact form
of the group. This apparent contradiction can be resolved [6] by dropping the above
requirement for a Hopf ∗-structure. Instead one deﬁnes an anti-involution on the larger
algebra T∗Gq

Ω†
± = Ω∓
g† = h.

It is straightforward [6] to check the compatibility of this anti-involution with the
quantum algebra (2)(3)(4)(14). Note that (16) does not deﬁne a Hopf ∗-structure on
Uq(g), and (17) does not close on Funq(G) since the deﬁnition of h includes generators
of Uq(g). In the classical limit (17) reduces to g† = g−1 and (16) becomes compatible
with the coproduct. This is due to the fact that the coproduct is cocommutative
atq = 1.

4 Real Form for the q-Deformed Hyperboloid

This section contains the main result of the paper, an anti-involution on the deformed
cotangent bundle when q is a phase. Like the anti-involution of the previous section,
it does not originate from a Hopf ∗-structure on one of the Hopf subalgebras. The
deﬁning relations of the anti-involution are

Alternatively the second relation can be written as

It is quite obvious that (18) is not compatible with the coproduct, i.e. g should not
be considered a “group element”. I will not give a complete proof of the consistency

g† = g

Ω† = Σ = g−1Ωg.

of the anti-involution with the algebra relations (2)(3)(4). Instead I will just give a
sample computation leaving the rest for the interested reader.

Applying the involution on the R+ relation (2) and using (15) we have

Moving the R− matrices to the other side and using (1) we obtain

(g2)†(g1)†R− = R−(g1)†(g2)†.

R+(g1)†(g2)† = (g2)†(g1)†R+,

thus it is consistent with the algebra relations (2) to impose g† = g.

As another example, take the hermitian conjugate of the following relation

R+Ω1

+Ω2

+ = Ω2

+Ω1

+R+.

(21)

Using (19) we obtain

(Σ2

−)−1(Σ1

−)−1R− = R−(Σ1

−)−1(Σ2

−)−1

which can be rewritten after multiplication by some inverse matrices as

This is just one of the equations in (14).

Similarly applying the above involution on the ﬁrst relation in (4) we obtain

R−Σ2

This is equivalent using (1) and (5) to

Furthermore using (14) to commute the Σ matrices we have

Σ2

−(h1)−1 = Ω1

and since Ω and Σ commute with each other we ﬁnally obtain

h1Σ2

− = Σ2

−R+h1

which is again one of the relations in (14). All the other relations can be checked in a
similar fashion.

Finally I will explain the terminology used in the title of this section. Consider ﬁrst
for simplicity the SL(2, C) case. In the undeformed case a 2 × 2 hermitian matrix of
unit determinant deﬁnes the unit mass hyperboloid in Minkowski space. For simplicity
I will only consider one connected component of the manifold, for example the future
mass hyperboloid. For a general group G this can be achieved by restricting to positive

quantum determinant.

5 Quantum Mechanics on the q-Deformed Hyperboloid

In [5] Alekseev and Faddeev showed that the T∗Gq quantum algebra is a q-deformation
of the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle of the Lie group G. In [6] they
considered the following simple Lagrangian written in ﬁrst order formalism

Here G is considered without specifying its real form. The Lagrangian has a chiral
symmetry G × G

g → ugv−1, ω → uωv−1, u, v ∈ G.

The second order form of the Lagrangian has the form of a non-linear sigma model in
(0, 1) dimensions

(22)

(23)

The equations of motion

can be integrated to give the time evolution

L = Tr(ω ˙gg−1 −

ω2).

L =

Tr( ˙gg−1 ˙gg−1).

˙g = ωg,

˙ω = 0

ω(t) = ω(0)

g(t) = exp(ωt) g(0).

8

The real form corresponding to the compact group discussed in [6] is

g† = g−1, ω† = −ω.

(24)

For G = SL(2, C), g becomes unitary and the Lagrangian (22) describes the classical
dynamics of the symmetric top. Equivalently, it describes the motion on a constant
curvature S3. This can be seen using the chiral symmetry (5) of the Lagrangian, which
under the conditions (24) is restricted to the SU (2) × SU (2) ∼ SO(4) subgroup, or by
direct computation of the metric in the kinetic term of (23).

Instead, we consider the following reality structure

g† = g, ω† = g−1ωg

(25)

which, following from the discussion at the end of the previous, section deﬁnes the
phase space of a particle moving on the mass-hyperboloid. The reality structure (25)
requires u† = v−1 thus restricting the chiral symmetry of the Lagrangian to one in-
dependent SL(2, C) subgroup which is simply the Lorentz group that leaves the mass
hyperboloid invariant. The metric on the hyperboloid is just the induced metric from
Minkowski space, and again this can be obtained by direct computation or using the
above invariance under the Lorentz group.

One can check that the equations of motion preserve both reality structures (24)
and (25). What we learn from this simple example is that one can ﬁnd rather diﬀerent
physical systems that will have the same Poisson brackets and thus quantum algebras
if their respective Lagrangians have the same form, diﬀering only through their reality
structures.

In [6] a q-deformation of the above system was introduced. The model has a
discrete time dynamics, with the time labelled by an integer n. The following evolution
equations

Ω(n) = Ω(0)
g(n) = Ωng(0)

(26)

were shown in [6] to preserve the quantum algebra (2)(3)(4) and in addition, the reality
structure discussed in Section 3.

I will now show that they also preserve the reality structure introduced in Section 4.

Assuming that for n = 0 the reality structure is given by (18) and (20)

g†(0) = g(0), Ω†(0) = g−1(0) Ω(0) g(0)

9

for arbitrary n we have

Similarly we have for Ω(n)

g†(n) = g†(0)(Ω†(0))n = g(0)(g−1(0)Ω())g(0))n = Ωn(0)g(0) = g(n).

Ω†(n) = Ω†(0) = g−1(0)Ω(0)g(0) = g−1(n)Ω(0)g(n) = g−1(n)Ω(n)g(n).

Thus the equations of motion (26) and the reality structure of the previous Section
deﬁne the q-deformation of the dynamics of a particle on the unit mass hyperboloid.

6 Concluding Remarks

I conclude by brieﬂy applying the reality structure to the lattice regularized WZNW-
model and checking its compatibility with periodic boundary conditions. Using the
notation in [2] let the lattice have N points, and denote the local ﬁelds by gi, i =
1 . . . N . For periodic boundary conditions we identify i and i + N . Let ML and MR
be the monodromies of the left and right aﬃne currents. The algebra satisﬁed by
(g, ML, MR) is exactly the algebra of T∗Gq for the generators (g, Ω, Σ). Here I used
the remark of the previous Section that the compact and non-compact WZNW-models
have the same algebra since their respective Lagrangians coincide. The monodromies
can be used to relate the ﬁelds g0 and gN

gN = MLg0M −1
R

If we require g†
have

0 = g0, M †

L = MR, which is just the reality structure of Section 4, we

R )†g0M †

g†
N = (M −1

L = M −1
In the last step I used the lattice periodicity. Thus we see that the reality structure
is compatible with periodic boundary conditions. A more detailed investigation of the
implications of this reality structure for the WZNW-model will be presented in an
upcoming paper.

L g0MR = g−N = gN .

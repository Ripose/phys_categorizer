Abstract 

It is important to have experimental methods to estimate the maximum beam intensity for 

the  Fermilab  Booster  as  objective  input  into  long  term  program  commitments.  An 

important  existing  limit  is  set  by  the  available  rf  power.  This  limit  is  difficult  to  set  a 

priori, because the real longitudinal impedance is not well known. The synchrotron phase 

at  transition  crossing  was  measured  using  both  the  mountain  range  plot  and  the  direct 

phase measurement of the RF accelerating voltage relative to the beam, and results were 
consistent.  They were applied to predict 6·1012 maximum Booster beam intensity with 

present running conditions. 

1  Introduction 

A  synchrotron  phase  detector  has  been  implemented  in  the  Fermilab  Booster  directly 

measuring the relative phase between the beam and the RF voltage in the RF cavities.  It 

is a useful tool in numerous situations, such as in estimating the maximum beam intensity 

that  can  be  achieved  in  Booster  under  the  present  running  conditions,  including  the  RF 

power, the efficiency of the LLRF system, etc.   

2  Instrumentation 

There are two RF input signals to the phase detector.  One is the pickup from the resistive 

wall monitor in the straight section long 18 of the Booster ring.  The signal to noise ratio 

from  the  beam  current  pickup  is  improved  by  connecting  it  through  a  bandpass  filter 

because  the  6  GHz  bandwidth  of  the  resistive  wall  monitor  passes  much  other

information besides the phase of the rf fundamental component.  The other input signal to 

the phase detector is the vector sum of two downstream gap pickups, from station 7 of the 

group  A and station 8 of the group  B.   It is necessary to have the summed input signal 

from  both  cavity  groups  because  the  two  groups  can  be  run  with  arbitrary  but  opposite 

offsets  from  the  synchronous  phase  to  control  the  effective  rf  amplitude  acting  on  the 

beam. Cable lengths of the two input signals to the phase detector were carefully matched 

since  Booster  RF  frequency  changes  from  37.8  MHz  at  injection  to  53.4  MHz  at 

extraction.  Afterwards, the final adjustment of the two cable lengths was made using a 

criterion  of  zero  degree  synchrotron  phase  at  injection.    The  phase  detector  delivers  a 

signal  of  9  degree  per  volt.    A  more  complete  technical  description  of  the  full  phase 

detector system is being prepared (X. Yang and R. Padilla, work in progress). From the 

output of the phase detector, one can obtain the relative phase between the beam signal 

and the effective RF voltage at the gap of RF cavities. 

3  Initial Application 

The  Booster  beam  intensity  has  been  continually  pushed  to  its  limit  in  the  last  several 

years.    A  serious  limiting  factor  has  been  the  accelerating  voltage  available  from  the 

present  RF  system  at  the  time  of  transition  crossing.    Due  to  the  transition-crossing 

properties of a synchrotron, a bunch in Booster gets shorter as it approaches transition.  It 

reaches  its  maximum  peak  current  since  the  bunch  length  reaches  its  minimum  near 

transition.  The beam loses energy to the real part of the ring impedance, and the amount 

of the energy loss (deceleration) is closely related to the peak beam current.  With greater 

beam intensity, the amount of the energy loss per particle at transition crossing due to the 

peak-current increment gets larger.  The feedback system tries to correct this situation by 

driving the synchrotron phase toward 90 degrees to get more accelerating voltage.  Until 

the  synchrotron  phase  reaches  90  degrees  the  synchronous  particle  at  least  continues  to 

receive  the  proper  acceleration.    However,  the  stable  region  of  phase  space  around  the 

synchronous particle (the bucket) shrinks as the synchronous phase increases. Any further 

increment  of  the  beam  intensity  introduces  an  excessive  reduction  of  the  gap  voltage, 

which can no longer be  compensated by the change of the synchrotron phase.  Beam is 

lost  because  of  insufficient  accelerating  voltage.    The  process  of  the  particle  loss  may

continue until an equilibrium is reached.  This can be understood as follows: during the 

fast ramp of a Booster cycle, the particles without correct acceleration will have different 

momentums with respect to the synchronous particle, such that their orbits are different 

from  that  of  the  synchronous  particles.    If  the  difference  between  the  off-momentum 

particles  and  the  synchronous  particle  is  large  enough  to  reach  the  dynamic  aperture, 

these particles are lost.  With more and more particles lost, the beam induced voltage will 

get smaller until an equilibrium is reached in which any remaining particles get the right 

acceleration.  This  problem  is  most  severe  at  transition  because  the  largest  energy  loss 

arises from the highest peak beam current in a Booster cycle, and average power demand 

is  near  its  maximum  because  the  ramp  rate  is  also  close  to  its  maximum.    A  90-degree 

synchrotron phase signifies that peak beam current has reached its limit. 

4  Experimental Results 

We used two different experimental approaches for the synchrotron phase measurement.  

One is to extract the synchrotron phase from a so-called mountain range plot (see Fig. 1) 

using  the  signal  from  the  resistive  wall  monitor.    The  mountain  range  plot  was  used  to 

record the process of the transition jump.  The phase of the RF waveform changes from j 

to 180(cid:176)-j during the transition crossing.  Thus the phase jump is calculated from Eq. 1. 

Dj = (180(cid:176) - j) - j = 180(cid:176) - 2 j                                                                                     (1) 

The mountain range plot was triggered 80 ms before transition, with 1 trace per 8 turns for 

40  traces.    The  time  covered  by  the  mountain  range  plot  was  more  than  600  ms.    We 

obtained  the  amount  of  the  phase  jump  by  measuring  the  jump  (Dt)  in  time  of  the  RF 

wave relative to one of the Booster bunches at the transition crossing and simultaneously 

recorded the period (T) of the RF wave.  We can calculate the phase jump of the RF wave 

relative to the beam during the transition cross using Eq. 2.  

Dj = (Dt/T) · 360(cid:176)                                                                                                            (2) 

Substituting from Eq. 2 into Eq. 1, we obtain the synchrotron phase right before and after 

transition.  Here, we assume the phase jump is symmetric about 90 degrees, meaning that 

the synchrotron phase changes from j to 180-j.  However, this assumption is not exact 

in practice, as we will see later from the synchrotron phase measurement using the phase 

detector.  From  Fig.  (1),  the  synchrotron  phase  near  the  transition  approaches  90(cid:176)  more

closely as the beam intensity goes higher.  Assuming the per-particle energy loss per turn 

is  linearly  proportional  to  the  intensity  of  the  beam,  we  can  estimate  the  maximum 

intensity that can be obtained in Booster when the RF power at the transition limits beam 
intensity. The result obtained from the data plotted in Fig. 2 is 6·1012 protons per cycle.  

The  other  approach  to  determining  the  synchronous  phase  is  the  direct  measurement 

using the synchrotron phase detector. The results are shown in Fig. 3. 

5  Conclusion 

We  can  experimentally  observe  the  relationship  between  the  synchrotron  phase  and  the 

beam intensity using the synchrotron phase detector.  From this relationship we estimate 

the highest beam intensity that can be achieved in the Booster.  Furthermore, we can use 

the synchrotron phase detector as one of the experimental tools to optimize the Booster 

running  conditions  by  controlling  the  synchrotron  phase  after  the  transition  crossing 

while  keeping  the  beam  intensity  as  high  as  possible.    We  can  minimize  beam  loading 

and energy loss by reducing the peak current. One may try to make the feedback system 

faster  and  more  efficient,  etc.  The  effect  of  any  such  changes  will  be  manifest  in  the 

synchrotron phase measurement.

Fig. 1 The mountain range plot was triggered 80  ms before the transition, and the same 

Booster  bunch  was  plotted  at  one  trace  per  8  Booster  turns.    The  same  time  scale  (2 

ns/div) for Fig. 1(a)-(f).  During the plot time, the RF period is about 19.1 ns.  The trigger 

for the mountain range plot was the LLRF driving signal of Booster RF cavities.  In each

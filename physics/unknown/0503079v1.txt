Abstract 

In addition to contributing to the accelerated expansion of the Universe, little black 
holes  (LBH)  can  exhibit  strong  interactions  with  large-scale  manifestations  in 
interacting  with  each  other,  and  with  large  macroscopic  bodies  such  as  stars, 
neutron  stars,  and  planets.    A  range  of  proposals  are  reviewed  in  which  both  free 
and  bound    LBH  are  considered  to  be  either  a  small  component  or  the  dominant 
constituent of dark matter/dark energy.  Although previously dismissed, an LBH is 
a potential candidate in accounting for the 1908 devastation of Tungus Siberia, since 
important  LBH  interactions  were  overlooked.    LBH  passing  through  neutron  star 
pulsars are capable of causing a sudden change in frequency which may not be fully 
accounted  for  by  other  theories.    Rapid  energy  input    due  to  the  passage  of  LBH 
through  the  earth,  sun,  and  neutron  stars  is  examined  to  determine  if  they  could 
initiate tremors and quakes in such bodies.  A case is made that in encounters with 
the  earth(cid:146)s  atmosphere,  cosmic  LBH  can  manifest  themselves  as  the  core  energy 
source  of  ball  lightning  (BL).    Relating  the  LBH  incidence  rate  on  earth  to  BL 
occurrence  has  the  potential  of  shedding  light  on  the  distribution  of  LBH  in  the 
universe, and their velocities relative to the earth.  Most BL features can be explained 
by  a  testable  LBH  model.   Analyses are presented to support this model. The total 
number of degrees of freedom of a d-dimensional body in n-space is  derived so that 
equipartition  of  energy  may  be  applied  in  the  early  universe  and  related  to  LBH.  
Blackbody and Hawking radiation are generalized to n-space.  The entropy of LBH 
and  of  the  universe  are  examined.  Novel  black  hole  entropy  equations  are  obtained, 
which  may  shed  light  on  the  enigma  of  why  the  primordial  universe  appears  to  have  so 
extremely  little  entropy.    The  largest  possible  attractive  force,  repulsive  force,  and 
luminosity in nature are considered in the context of LBH.  A question is raised as to 
whether  the  Planck  scale  is  truly  fundamental.    The  gravitational  fine  structure 
constant is re-examined.

1  Introduction 
The  discovery  of  the  accelerated  expansion  of  the  universe  was  totally 
 
unanticipated.  It calls long-standing cosmological theories into question.  It introduces 
new enigmas related to dark matter/dark energy; and may shed light on an old enigma 
that  some  stars  appear  to  be  older  than  the  previously  accepted  age  of  the  universe.  
The  implication  is  that  the  universe  is  older,  bigger,  and  less  dense  than  previously 
thought by a number of accepted measurements.  The new discoveries radically change 
our concept of what drives the macrocosm, and initiate a fundamentally new quest for 
the laws that govern the universe on a large scale. 
 
Our    universe  is  so  full of surprises  that  caution should always be the byword.  
An  old  saying  has  it  that  cosmologists  proceed  undaunted  in  being  almost  always 
certain,  but  rarely  right.  This  has  been  the  case  with  regards  to  the  character  of  the 
expansion of the universe.  It has long been taken for granted that the expansion of the 
universe is either at a constant rate, or decelerating due to  the gravitational attraction 
of  all  the  mass  in  it.    So  it  came  as  quite  a  surprise  in  1998  when  two  independent 
international groups of astrophysicists at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (Perlmutter 
et al.,1998) in the U.S., and Mount Strombo and Siding Spring Observatories (Riess et al., 
1998)  in  Australia,  using  type  Ia  supernovae  to  gauge  distances,  discovered  that  the 
universe  is  accelerating  in  its  expansion.    One  viable  competing  explanation  is  that  
accelerated  expansion  of  the universe  is due to  radiation from  little black holes (LBH) 
propelling them outward and gravitationally towing ordinary matter with them.  Little

black  holes  may  be  the  dark  matter/dark  energy  representing  95%  of  the  mass  of  the 
universe (Rabinowitz, 1998, 1999 a,b, 2001a,b,c, 2003).   
 
2  Radiation in n-Space  
 
 
Understanding  the  distinction  between  Hawking  radiation  and  Gravitational 
Tunneling  Radiation  from  black  holes  is  key  to  being  able  to  comprehend  and 
discriminate  between  various  views  of  black  holes  as  dark  matter  candidates.    Since 
Hawking  radiation  is  presented  as  blackbody  radiation  from  a  black  hole,  ordinary 
blackbody radiation is a good starting point.  Because so much of Modern Cosmology 
involves  the  possibility  of  higher  dimensional  space,  let  us  develop  equations  in  n-
space which can easily be reduced to their 3-space counterparts.

 It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  dimensionality  of  macroscopic  space  can  be 
determined by measuring the exponent of the blackbody radiation law.  If energetically 
stable  atoms  (e.g.  bound  by  additional  short-range  forces)  could  exist  in  (n  >  3)-space 
(cf.  Sec.  18),  eq.  (2.3)  says  that  for  high  T,  the  collective  blackbody  radiation  of  these 
atoms  emits  considerably  higher  power  than  in  3-space,  and  for low  T the opposite is 
true.

The  Hawking  radiated  power,  PSH ,  follows  from  the  Stefan-Boltzmann 

 
blackbody radiation power/area law σT4  for black holes.   For Hawking (1974, 1975):

where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.    R H
 is the Schwarzchild radius, 
often also called the horizon of the black hole.  To avoid the realm of quantum gravity, 
Hawking requires the black hole mass M >  MPlanck . 
 
Since  Hawking  radiation  was  developed  as  blackbody  radiation  from  a  black 
hole,  using  eq.  (2.3),  RHn  and  Tn  from  (Rabinowitz,  2001a,  b),  the  Hawking  power

Although ordinary blackbody radiation is dramatically large in 4-space and higher e.g. 
  ∝ T11
in 10-space, the mass dependency of Hawking radiation causes it to decrease for 
dimensions higher than 3 for LBH.  

2.3  Compact dimensions attenuate Hawking radiation 
 
 
Another  approach assumes the correctness of the Hawking model, but analyzes 
the  effects  of  additional  compact  dimensions  on  the  attenuation  of  this  radiation.  
Argyres  et  al  (1998)  conclude  that  the  properties  of  LBH  are  greatly  altered  and  LBH 
radiation is considerably attenuated from that of Hawking(cid:146)s prediction.  Their LBH are 
trapped by branes so essentially only gravitons can get through the brane (which may 
be  thought  of  as  an  abbreviation  for  vibrating  membrane).    For  them,  not  only  is  the 
radiation  rate  as  much  as  a  factor  of  1038  lower  than  given  by  Hawking,  but  it  also 
differs by being almost entirely gravitons. 
 
2.4  Gravitational tunneling radiation (GTR) 
 
Gravitational  tunneling  radiation  (GTR)  may  be  emitted  from  black  holes  in  a 
 
process differing from that of Hawking radiation, PSH , which has been undetected for 
over three decades.  Belinski (1995), a noted authority in the field of general relativity, 
unequivocally concludes (cid:147)the effect [Hawking radiation] does not exist.(cid:148) GTR is offered 
as  an  alternative  to  PSH.  In  the  gravitational  tunneling  model  (Rabinowitz,1999  a,b),  
beamed exhaust radiation  tunnels out from a LBH with radiated power, PR , due to the 
field of a second body, which lowers the LBH gravitational potential energy barrier and 
gives the barrier a finite width.  Particles can escape by tunneling (as in field emission).

This is similar to electric field emission of electrons from a metal by the application of 
an external field.   
 
Although  PR  is  of  a  different  physical  origin  than  Hawking  radiation,  we  shall 
 
∝ ΓPSH ,  where  Γ  is  the 
see  that  it  is  analytically  of  the  same  form,  since  PR
transmission  probability  approximately  equal  to  the WKBJ  (Wentzel-Kramers-Brilloin-
Jefferies,  also  called  WKB)  tunneling  probability    e-2∆γ 
for  LBH.    The  tunneling  power 
radiated from a LBH for r >> RH is:

where M in kg is the mass of the LBH.  No correction for gravitational red shift needs to 
be  made  since  the  particles  tunnel  through  the  barrier  without  change  in  energy.  The 
tunneling probability e-2∆γ 
is usually << 1 and depends on parameters such as the width 
of the barrier, M, and the mass of the second body (Rabinowitz,1999 a,b) .   
Hawking  invoked  blackbody  radiation  in  the  derivation  of  eq.  (2.4).  But  it  was 
 
not  invoked  in  the  GTR  derivation  of  eq.  (2.6).    Although  PR    and  PSH  represent  
different physical processes and appear quite disparate, the differences in the equations 
almost  disappear  if  we  substitute  into  eq.  (2.4)  the  value  obtained  for  the  Stefan-
Boltzmann constant σ by integrating the Planck distribution over all frequencies:

GTR is beamed between a black hole and a second body, and is attenuated by the

Two LBH may get quite close for maximum GTR.  In this limit,  e

−2∆γ → 1, and  
there is a similarity between GTR  and what  is expected from  Hawking’s model.  GTR 
produces  a  repulsive  recoil  force  between  two  bodies  due  to  the  beamed  emission 
between them.  Since the tidal forces of two LBH add together to give more radiation at 
their interface in his model, this also produces a repulsive force.

As  a  black  hole  becomes  more  and  more  charged,  the  Hawking  radiation 
 
decreases  until  in  the  limit  of  maximum  charge  containment  there  is  none.    Balbinot 
(1986)  demonstrated  that  highly  charged    black  holes  do  not  Hawking  radiate.    He 
determined  that  (cid:147)For  an  extreme  Reissner-Nordstrom  [highly  charged]  black  hole  ... 
there is no Hawking evaporation.(cid:148)  There is no mention of this in Chavda and Chavda 
(2002) whose atomic black hole model will be discussed in Sec. 3.  They did not address 
the  question  of  the  accelerated  expansion  of  the  universe.  Nor  do  they  consider 
moderately  charged  black holes which could form electrostatically  and gravitationally 
bound  atoms.    Chavda  and  Chavda  (2002)  realized  that  the  universe  can  be  better 
understood  without  Hawking  radiation.    However  it  appears  that  they  used  an 
incorrect  method  to  dispense  with  it.    Though  charged  black  holes  have  not  been 
candidates for dark matter, charged black hole atoms, neutralized by orbiting charges, 
have been considered by Rabinowitz (1999 a).   

2.6  Gravitational radiation 
          An advanced quadrupole suspension design (Robertson, 2002) for the U.S. Laser 
Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory  (LIGO) has recently been described to 
measure  gravitational  radiation  from  distant  sources.    Preparation  is  also  being  made 
by other teams around the world.  In addition to LIGO, there is VIRGO (France/Italy); 
GEO-600 (Britain/ Germany); TAMA (Japan); and ACIAGA (Australia).  The detectors 
are  laser  interferometers  with  a  beam  splitter  and  mirrors  suspended  on  wires.    The 
predicted gravitational wave displaces the mirrors and shifts the relative optical phase 
in two perpendicular paths.  This causes a shift in the interference pattern at the beam 
splitter.    It  is  expected  that  by  2010,  the  devices  will  be  sensitive  enough  to  detect 
gravitational waves up to 102 Megaparsecs ( 3.26 x 108 lightyear = 3.1 x 1024 m) away.  
A  perplexity  arose  because  the  detector  noise  does  not  satisfy  the  usual  assumptions 
that it be stationary and Gaussian (Allen et al, 1999) 
This  perplexity  may  be  due  to  radiation  from  gravitationally  bound  atoms 
 
(GBA).  As  shown  in  (Rabinowitz,  2001a,b,  2003),  quantized  gravitational  radiation  is 
possible  from  GBA.  The possibility  was  presented  that a  signal  from such potentially 
nearby  sources  can  compete  or  interfere  with  distant  sources  such  as  neutron  stars, 
binary  pulsars,  and  coalescing  black  holes.    Signals  from  such  distant  sources  are 
expected to have frequencies in the range from 10 Hz to 104 Hz (Davies, 1992). It was 
shown  that  gravitational  radiation  from  orbital  de-excitation  of  an  ordinary  mass 
orbiting a LBH  would have a detectable frequency ~ 103 Hz [2].  A mass  m ~ 10-27 kg 
orbiting a LBH of mass M ~ 10 kg, would emit a frequency ~ 103 Hz. in going from the  j 
= 3  state to the j = 1 ground state. 
 
3  Different Views of Black Holes as Dark Matter Candidates 
 
Discovery of the nature of dark matter/dark energy will help to define what the 
 
universe is made of.  It will reveal the invisible particles carrying the gravitational glue 
that holds the universe, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies together, and determines the 

-6- 

 

 

curvature of space.  We should not arbitrarily rule out the possibility that dark matter 
can  occasionally  display  itself  on  earth;  and  we  shall  explore  what  form  its 
manifestation  may  take.  Let  us  briefly  look  at  various  views  of  black  holes  as  dark 
matter candidates to give us a broad perspective.   
 
3.1 Large black holes: 1014 kg ≤ MBH ≤ 1036 kg   
 
 
A 1984 review article (Blumenthal et al and references therein) presents the then 
and presently prevailing view of black holes as constituents of dark matter.  The article 
considers only rather massive black holes as a possible component of dark matter:  "A 
third cold DM [dark matter] candidate is black holes of mass 10-16 Msun ≤ MBH ≤ 106 
Msun,  the  lower  limit implied  by  the non-observation  of  γ rays from black hole decay 
by Hawking radiation...."  Msun = 2 x 1030 kg implies that for them 1014 kg ≤ MBH ≤ 
1036 kg.   
 
3.2 Medium black holes: 1012 kg ≤ MBH ≤ 1030 kg  
 
 
Trofimenko (1990) discussed the possibility that black holes up to the mass of the 
sun,  Msun,  are  involved  in  a  multitude  of  geophysical  and  astrophysical  phenomena 
such as in stars, pulsars, and planets.   Although he did not explicitly consider them as 
candidates  for  dark  matter,  for  him  they  are  "universal  centres  of  all  cosmic  objects."  
That  implicitly  makes  them  dark  matter  candidates  .    He  was  not  concerned  with  the 
ramifications of LBH radiation, nor the time for LBH to devour their hosts.  His lower 
mass limit of 1012 kg comes from the failure to detect Hawking radiation, and expected 
smallest primordial mass survival.   
 
3.3  Primordial black holes: MBH ~ 1013 kg  
 
Alfonso-Faus  (1993)  proposed  "primordial  black  holes,  massive  particles  about 
 
1040 times the proton mass" [1040(10-27 kg) = 1013 kg] as his dark matter candidate.  He 
goes  on  to  say  that  they  do  not  radiate  by  Hawking  radiation,  but  did  not  then 
comment  on  how  they  radiate.    Later  Alfonso-Faus  (1999)  asserts  a  radiation 
wavelength of 108 cm from black holes that is the geometric mean between the radius of 
such a primordial black hole (10-12 cm) and the radius of the universe (1028 cm).  With 
such a long wavelength, he concludes that they radiate, "about 1040 times lower " than 
in the Hawking model and hence "they would still be around....." 
 
3.4.  Primordial black holes in higher dimensional space:  1029 kg ≤ MBH ≤ 1034 kg  
 

-7- 

 

  

 

  

 

 

Argyres  et  al  (1998)  examine  primordial  black  holes  (PBH)  in  higher  compact 
 
dimensions.    They  conclude  that  for  6  extra  compact  dimensions  (9-space),  0.1  solar 
mass  PBH  are  dark  matter  candidates,  but  that  this  increases  to  ~104  solar  masses  if 
there are only 2 or 3 extra dimensions (5 to 6-space).  So for them 1029 kg ≤ MBH ≤ 1034 
kg.  Smaller PBH might be expected to abound, since for them PBH radiation is almost 
entirely  gravitons.    In  standard  Hawking  radiation  from  LBH,  >  MeV  photons  would 
dissociate  big  bang  nucleosynthesis  products,  devastating  the  presently  propitious 
predictions of light element abundances.  They conclude, "The lightest black holes that 
can  be  present  with  any  significant  number  density  in  our  universe  today  are  thus 
formed immediately after the epoch of inflationary reheating."      
 
3.5  GTR radiating primordial little black holes: 10-7 kg ≤ MLBH ≤ 1019 kg  
 
Starting in 1998, this author proposed that black holes radiate by  gravitational 
 
tunneling  radiation (GTR) resulting in a most compelling case for primordial LBH as  
the  main  constituent  of  dark  matter  of  the  universe  (Rabinowitz,  1998  a,b,  1999, 
2001a,b,  2003).    These  were  the  smallest  masses  (10-7  kg  to  1019 kg) considered until 
2002.   Since GTR is greatly attenuated compared with Hawking radiation, cf. Section 
6.4,  this has strong implications down to the smallest masses of LBH, whether the LBH 
are  free  or  are  gravitationally  bound  atoms.    For  Hawking  (1974,  1975),  the  smallest 
LBH that can survive to the present is M ~ 1012 kg .   
 
The  GTR  model  is  only  briefly  covered  in  this  review  section,  since  its 
implications are further examined elsewhere in this Chapter.  Let us look here at one of 
the  predictions  of  GTR.      The  evaporation  rate  for  a  black  hole  of  mass  M  is 

d Mc2(

Hawking’s  result  (1974, 1975) of 1012 kg  is  obtained   by setting  e
 = 1 in eq. (3.3).   
≤ 1, an entire range of black hole masses much smaller than 1012 kg may 
Since  0 ≤ e
have  survived  from  the  beginning  of  the  universe  to  the  present  than  permitted  by 
Hawking’s theory.   

  For example, if the average tunneling probability e

~ 10-45, then Msmall ~ 
 
10-3 kg.  For Muniv  ~ 1053 kg, Vuniv  ~ 1079 m3 (radius of 14 x109 light-year  ≈ 1.4 x 1026 
m), the average density of such LBH would be  1 LBH per 1023m3 .  The velocity of our 
local group of galaxies with respect to the microwave background (cosmic rest frame),  
6.2  x  105  m/sec    (Turner  and  Tyson,  1999),    is  a  reasonable  velocity  for  LBH    with 
respect  to   the   earth.   This   may   make  it   possible   to   detect  their  incident  flux   
~ (10-23/m3)(6.2 x 105 m/sec) ~ 10-17/m2sec on the earth (Rabinowitz, 2001 a,b), about 
which we will go into more detail in this Chapter. 
 
3.6 Non-radiating holeum :  10-24 kg  ≤ MBH ≤  10-12 kg 
 
 
By  analogy  with  the  neutron,  Chavda  and  Chavda  (2002)  introduced  a  novel 
proposal  that  gravitationally  bound  black  holes  will  not  Hawking  radiate.  Free 
neutrons  are  unstable,  but  bound  neutrons  are  stable  in  most  nuclei.    Their  model  is 
briefly reviewed in this section, and will be further analyzed in detail in Secs, 16 and 17, 
as  it  dispenses  with  Hawking  radiation  in  a  novel  way.    It  appears  from  my  analysis 
that  stable  holeum  cannot  exist  in  3-space,  or  in  any  higher  dimensions.    Therefore 
whether or not such  an object  might Hawking radiate is a moot point.  They consider 
the range 10-24 kg  ≤ MBH ≤  10-12 kg.   
 
The analogy between holeum and a bound neutron may not apply.  A neutron in 
free  space  decays  with  a  half-life  of  about  10.6  minutes.    The  neutron  spontaneously 
decays  into  a  proton,  an  electron,  and  an  antineutrino.    This  is  energetically  possible 
because  the  neutron’s  rest  mass  is  greater  than  that  of  the  decay  products.    This 
difference in rest mass manifests itself in an energy release of 1.25 x 10-13 J (0.782 MeV).  
The  situation  in  a  nucleus  is  complicated  by  many  factors  such  as  Fermi  levels  of  the 
neutrons and the protons, etc. Neutrons do decay in nuclei that are beta emitters despite 
their   relatively  large binding energy which is typically 1 to 1.4 x 10-12 J (6 to 8 MeV).  
Other  than  the  interesting  neutron  analogy,    they  give  no  compelling  reasons  for  the 
absence of Hawking radiation in black hole GBA. 
 
Most of the orbital radii are in the strong field region 2 RH < r < 10 RH, requiring 
general  relativity  corrections.    Therefore  in  the  absence  of  r  >  10RH,  their  use  of 
Newtonian gravity is questionable.  There is an error by a factor of 102 too high in the 
orbital radius given by their eq. (45).  
In  considering  little  black  hole  masses MLBH <  MPlanck~ 10-8 kg ,  their analysis 
 
exceeds  another  domain  of  validity  which  requires  a  theory  of  quantum  gravity.  For 
larger masses and larger radii than they use, it would be easy to agree with their choice 

-9- 

 

     

 

 

of  quantized  Newtonian  Gravity.    Except  for  the  0  angular  momentum  state  (which 
does not exist semi-classically), essentially the same results are obtained semi-classically 
as are gotten quantum mechanically for hydrogen.  It is generally agreed that for MLBH 
> MPlanck one may describe LBH  with semi-classical physics,  and  quantum  gravity  is  
needed for  MBH ≤ 10-8 kg, since this is below the Planck scale where a little black hole 
has RH ≤ 10-35 m.   
Neglect of special relativity is a further problem, since in some cases the orbital 
 
velocity in holeum  v ≈ c.  It is relevant to note that non-relativistic quantum mechanics 
and  even  the  semi-classical  Bohr-Sommerfeld  equation  give  accurate  energy levels for 
hydrogen  despite  being  non-relativistic.    This  is  because  the  serendipitously  near-
canceling  effects of both relativity and spin are neglected.  One effect is the relativistic 
increase of the electron’s mass as its velocity increases near the proton.  The other effect 
is the interaction of the electron’s intrinsic magnetic moment with the Coulomb field of 
the proton.  Since a neutral LBH has no magnetic moment, there are no canceling effects 
and one may expect a much less reliable result from a treatment which ignores special 
relativity, such as theirs.   
 
4  Degrees of Freedom and Equipartition of Kinetic Energy in n-Space 
 
The  equipartition  of  kinetic  energy  is  an  important  principle  that  enters  into 
 
many  analyses  related  to  the  Universe,  as  well  as  those  in  this  Chapter.    With  the 
possibility of higher dimensional space it would be useful to have a generalization of it 
to any dimension n.  Since I could not find it in the literature, here is my generalization  
 
4.1  Degrees of freedom in n-space 
 
 
 
 
 
for d ≤ n.  Once n coordinates establish the center of mass, there are (n - 1) coordinates 
left to determine a second reference point on the body, leaving (n - 2) for the third point, 
..., and finally (n - d) coordinates for the (d + 1)th reference point.  
 
 
 

 
The total number of degrees of freedom Dn of a d-dimensional body in n-space is 

Since the RHS of eq. (4.1) has (d + 1) terms: 

= n + (n − 1) + (n − 2)+...+(n − d) ,

4.2  Generalization of equipartition of kinetic energy to n-space 
 
 
In  3-space,  D3  varies  from  3  for  d  =  0  (point-like  object)  to  6  for  d  =  2  (planar 
object like an ellipse) or d = 3 (object like a spheroid).  Choosing n = 10 in reference to 10 
-space string theory,  eq. (4.2) shows that D10  varies from 10 for d =  0, to 55 for  
d = 9 or 10 i.e. a 9 or 10-dimensional object.   
 
Because  the  kinetic  energy  is  a  quadratic  function  of  velocity  in  n-space,  there 
will  be  on  the  average  (1/2)kT  of  kinetic  energy  per  degree  of  freedom  Dn.    Let  us 
consider two cases:   
 
i.e. d = 3;   
 
dimensions in the space-time manifold of (n+1) dimensions.

                       = 3 kT for n = 3 . [(3/2)kT for a point-like body, depending on scale.] 
For n = 10, a 10-dimensional body has    KE  = (55/2)kT ≈ 28 kT.   
Thus in terms of equipartition of energy, at a given temperature T, there can be 
 
significantly  higher  kinetic  energy  than  expected  in  higher  dimensions.    Chavda  and 
Chavda  (2002)  are  interested  in  the  early  universe  when  the  temperature  T  >>  Tb  ≡  
mc2/k,  where  m  is  each  black  hole  mass  which  makes  up  holeum.    In  3-space,  the 
average kinetic energy is between 3/2 and 3 mc2 depending on the scale of interaction 
as  to  whether  the  black  holes  should  be  considered  point-like  or  3-dimensional  in 
collisions,  and  a  large  percentage  of  holium  collisions  may  result  in  dissociation.    If 
extra  dimensions  are  unfurled  in  the  early  universe,    from  eqs.  (4.4)  and  (4.5),  in  10-
space,  holeum  (if  also  bound  by  short  range  forces)  would  clearly  be  dissociated  in 

-11- 

 

 

collisions, since the average kinetic energy would be as high as 5 to 28 mc2.   Additional 
problems with their model will be presented later in this Chapter. 

5  Little Black Holes and Ball Lightning 
 
 
Prior to the awareness that LBH radiate appreciably, their presence on earth was 
considered  highly  unlikely,  as  it  was  expected  that  LBH  would  devour  the  earth  in 
times ~ million years.  But with Hawking radiation evaporation of LBH, their lifetime < 
~ year would be much less than the time it would take to ingest the earth.  However, 
LBH  would  be  unlikely  on  earth  with  Hawking  radiation,    because  this  devastating 
radiation  in  all  directions  has  not  been  observed.    The  view  of  radiation  from  LBH 
presented  by  the  Rabinowitz  model  (1999  a,  b)  obviates  both  of  the  above  problems 
since  this  radiation  is  beamed  and  considerably  less  than  Hawking(cid:146)s  (1974,  1975).    In 
the Rabinowitz model, when LBH get so small that there would be appreciable rocket-
like exhaust radiation, the radially outward radiation reaction force propels them away 
from the earth like a rocket ship.   
 
Ball  lightning  is  widely  accepted,  but  still  unexplained.    A  testable  LBH  model 
for  BL  is  presented  which  explains  most  of  the  known  features  of  BL.    In  this  model, 
LBH  produce  visible  light  in  interacting  with  the  atmosphere.    The  BL  core  energy 
source is gravitationally stored energy which is emitted as beamed radiation by means 
of gravitational field emission.   
 
Most of the results in Secs. 6 - 9 are derived independently of the model of black 
hole radiation.   Near the LBH, exhaust radiation can augment ionization and excitation, 
but  this  complication  will  not  be  introduced  at  this  time.    Although  a  number  of 
mechanisms are at work, orbital trapping with subsequent polarization and ionization 
by the LBH gravitational and electrostatic tidal force is the major direct LBH ionization 
mechanism.  LBH with mass < ~ 10-3 kg and radius <~ 10-30 m are found to be the most 
likely candidates to manifest themselves as ball lightning (BL).  

6  LBH Gravitational and Electrostatic Tidal Force  

6.1  Gravitationally enhanced ionization cross-section 
 
 
The  intense  attractive  converging  gravitational  and/or  electrostatic  field  of  a 
charged  LBH  causes  more  atmospheric  molecules  to  be  polarized  and  ionized  than 
given  by  only  kinetic  considerations.    Let  us  first  examine the gravitational case.  The 
gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m in the field of a LBH is

primarily  with  atoms  of  the  disassociated  molecule  since  the  binding  energy  of  the 
molecules << the ionization potential, and they will be torn apart well before getting in

close enough for ionization.  When the atomic collision frequency is low compared with 
the  ionization  rate  due  to  tidal  interaction  with  the  gravitational  field  of the LBH, the 
ionization radius ri can be increased.  This results in an enhanced ionization volume, i.e. 
an enhanced ionization cross-section σ
 
To  a  first  approximation,  this  problem  will  be  treated  as  a  simple  central  force 
problem  in  which  angular  momentum  is  conserved.    Implications  of  (1)  atomic 
scattering,  (2)  ionization  and  scattering  by  the  LBH  exhaust,  and  (3)  tidal  force 
interactions will be neglected for now.  These make orbital motion non-reentrant about 
the  LBH  as  indicated  by  the  Runge  vector  (or  Runge-Lenz  vector,  quantum 
mechanically).    Scattering  is  negligible  as  an  LBH  enters  the  low  density  atmosphere 
from outer space and starts to produce ions around it, and as we shall see even at high 
density, when  the mean free path λ > the enhanced interaction radius as calculated in 
this section.  The interaction analysis here applies to both the sphere of ionization and to 
the sphere of polarization.  So the symbol rip will represent either the ionization radius 
or the larger polarization radius depending on which case is to be considered.  
 
by introducing an effective potential energy 

We can make the problem one-dimensional involving only the radial dimension,

a function of both the density of the gas and the mass M of the LBH, since for small rE ,  
the mean free path > rE  even above atmospheric pressure.

Vi is the ionization potential (15.5 eV for nitrogen), and n is the number density of air 
atoms.    For  the  LBH  mass  range  of  interest  ~10-3  kg,  eq.  (7.4)  yields  >  ~  Watts  of 
radiated  power  in  agreement  with  observation.    Photons  with  15.5  eV  energy  have  a 
frequency  higher  than  visible  photons  of  a  few  eV  with  wavelengths  between  4000  ¯ 
and 8000 ¯.  However, energy degradation and other radiation mechanisms can result 
in visible light.  There is comparable thermal and de-excitation radiation.

Combining  eqs.  (8.1)  and  (8.2)  gives  the  required  radiated  power  for  levitation  in  the 
earth’s gravitational field as a LBH approaches the earth: 
= Mgc . 
 
 For a 10-7 kg LBH  to levitate only PR ~ 300 W is needed for levitation; and for a 3 x10-4 
kg  ( 1/3 gm) LBH  to levitate, PR ~ 106 W.  
In  one  model,  emission  is  mainly  by  the  six  kinds  of  neutrinos  (Thorne  et  al., 
 
1986)  and  in  another  almost  entirely  by  gravitons  (Argyres  et  al.,  1998).    The  emitted 
power    PR,  necessary  to  produce  levitation,  as  well  as  the  necessary  masses  and 
separations  of  the  LBH  and  host  body  needed  to  produce  this  exhaust  power  are 
independent  of the nature of  the emitted particles.  At  a distance  of  many  earth radii, 
the radiation is narrowly beamed toward the earth(cid:146)s center.  As a LBH gets close to the

where  ρ
LBH is the mass density of LBH at a distance far from the earth, typical of the 
average mass density of LBH throughout the universe.  Afar is the cross-sectional area 
of a curvilinear flux tube of LBH far  from the earth, AE is the cross-sectional area of the 
tube  where  it  ends  at  the  earth,  and  Vt  is  the  volume  of  the  curvilinear  flux  tube 
(cylinder).    Since the LBH were created during the big bang, at a large distance from  
the  earth  they  should  be  in  the  cosmic  rest  frame.    The  velocity  of  our  local  group  of 
galaxies  with  respect  to  the  microwave  background  (cosmic  rest  frame),  vLBH  ~  6.2  x 
105 m/sec (Turner and Tyson, 1999), is a reasonable velocity for LBH with respect to the 
earth.  Interestingly, as shown in Sec. 11, this is also the escape velocity from our sun. 
 
Because vLBH is high and LBH radiate little until they are near other masses, Sc 
can be neglected with negligible decay of large black holes into LBH in the volume  Vt.  
Similarly,  Sd  may  be  expected  to  be  small  until  LBH  are  in  the  vicinity  of  the  earth 
where  most  of  their  evaporation,  before  they  are  repelled  away,  is  in  a  volume of the

At  large  velocities,  LBH  that  do  not  slow  down  appreciably  due  to  their  large 
 
mass or angle of approach, either do not produce sufficient ionization to be seen or do 
not spend  sufficient time  in the atmosphere to be observed.  In the Rabinowitz model 
(1999a, b, c), those LBH that reach the earth(cid:146)s atmosphere and are small enough to have 
sufficient radiation reaction force to slow them down to the  range of 10-2  to  102 m/sec, 
with a typical value  vBL ~ 1 m/sec, manifest themselves as BL.  So eq. (9.4) implies that 
the  ball  lightning  current  in  the  atmosphere  ≈  the  LBH  current  far  away,  i.e.

The distribution of LBH masses is not known.  Assuming that LBH comprise all of the 
dark matter, i. e. 95 % of the mass of the universe (Rabinowitz, 1990 b) of which there is

incidence rate of BL is roughly in the range   
 
Even  if  p  were  100%,  10-11  km-2  sec-1  would  be  well  below  the  noise  level  of  existing 
devices such as at large facilities for neutrino detection. This rate is in  accord with the 
estimates for ball lightning incidence of Barry and Singer (1988) of 3 x 10-11 km-2 sec-1, 
and of Smirnov (1993) of 6.4 x 10-8 km-2 sec-1  to 10-6 km-2 sec-1.  This is well below the 
incidence rate of ordinary lightning (Turman, 1977).

10  Meeting Ball Lightning /Earth Lights Criteria  
 
If  greatly  decreased  radiation  permits  little  black  holes  to  be  prevalent 
 
throughout  the  universe,  then  it  is  reasonable  to  surmise  that  they  are  also  present  in 
the region of the earth.   If they are present on earth, then one may ask how they might 
manifest  themselves.      If  their  presence  can  help  to  explain  a  long-known,  well-
established phenomenon that has no other explanation, then they are viable candidates 
for  experimental investigations to test the validity of  this hypothesis.   It appears that 
ball lightning/earth lights represent an admirable testing ground.     
A  subtle  variety  of  ball  lightning  are  atmospheric  luminous  phenomena 
 
occurring in  locations such  as Hessdalen,  Norway  and elsewhere in  the world.  These 
are  sometimes  called  "earth  lights"  (Devereaux,  1989),  to  make  a  refined  distinction 

-18- 

 

 

between them and ball lightning, as they appear to be more dynamic and unrelated to 
thunderstorm  activity  though  otherwise  they  are  very  similar.  At  Hessdalen  large 
numbers  of  researchers  have  observed  earth  lights  moving  parallel  to  the  earth.    This 
may  just  be  a  manifestation  of  little  black  holes  where  the  LBH  have  approached 
somewhat  horizontally  or  there  is  a  large  component  of  horizontal  velocity  due  to  a 
component of horizontal radiation reaction force because of the presence of mountains. 
 
 The  Hessdalen  sightings  were  visual,  photographic,  and  had  strong  radar 
signals (Strand, 1984).  Such observations are compatible with a charged levitating black 
hole.    The  luminosity  and  radar  signals  may  be  accounted  for  by  the  atmospheric 
ionization  created  by  a  charged  little  black  hole  and  dragged  along  by  electrostatic 
attraction to the hole.  Lifetime measurements of the (ball lightning-like) earth lights at 
Hessdalen  are  among  the  most  reliable  as  these  were  directly  measured  by  numerous 
well-prepared observers both optically and with radar .    
The following criteria are presented as a guide for assessing  ball lightning/earth 
 
light models in general, and the little black hole model in particular.  The first five are 
derived from Uman (1968), and the rest are inferred from different sources (Fryberger, 
1994, and Singer, 1971).   

 

1)  Constant size, brightness, and shape for extended times  
 
The  large  amount  of  gravitationally  stored  energy  in  little  black  holes  and 
resulting kinetic energy accounts for the somewhat constant size, shape, and brightness 
of  ball lightning; and its particular shape is a function of the motion of the little black 
hole  as  it  drags  along  ionized  air.    Ball  lightning  has  stable  spherical,  pear-shaped, 
prolate and oblate ellipsoidal, cylindrical, and disk shapes (Singer, 1971).   
Models  that  depend  on  thermally  stored  energy  do  not  have  stability  due  to 
 
cooling with time.  For example, as given by eq. (3.1) a <~ 1/3 gm little black hole  can 
have a lifetime ~ 1 year  near the earth.  As it evaporates to a much smaller mass, with a 
concomitant  increase  in  radiation  reaction  force,  it  will  shoot  up  into  space  and  thus 
extend  its  lifetime.    Its  luminosity  can  vanish  when  its  trapped  charge  becomes 
neutralized,  by  going  into  the  ground  or  other  opaque  structures,  or  when  the  black 
hole  itself  becomes  disrupted, as possibly  when  the electrostatic repulsive  force of the 
ingested charge ♠ the gravitational force that holds it together.   
 
There are a number of models that fit this criterion.   Finkelstein and Rubinstein 
(1964)  proposed  that  ball  lightning  is  a  luminous  region  of  air  of  nonlinear  high 
electrical conductivity  carrying  a  high current density.  They showed that their model 
can  yield  ball-like  solutions.    A  similar  theory  was  presented  by  Uman  and  Helstrom 
(1966). Winterberg (1978) proposed an electrostatic theory of  ball lightning.   

 

2)   Untethered high mobility 
 
The lightness of a little black hole (<~ 1/3 gm) in which the  ball lightning mass 
mainly  resides,  gives  it  high  mobility.    A  small  horizontal  component  of  the  exhaust 
force accounts for its horizontal mobility.  A charged black hole will also experience an 
attractive  force  towards  its  image  charge  in  a  conductor,  and  either  a  repulsive  or 
attractive force with a charged dielectric, depending on the relative sign of the charges.  

-19- 

 

 

Untethered    mobility  vitiates  against  electrical    discharge  models  of    ball  lightning 
which  require  attachment  to  good  (e.g.,  metal)  or  poor  conductors  (e.g.,  earth,  wood) 
such as for St. Elmo(cid:146)s fire -- but attachment in either case.    

3)  Generally doesn’t rise 
 
The  ball lightning ionized air is electrostatically bound to the charge trapped in 
the little black hole and so is forced to follow its trajectory rather than simply rise.  Since 
heated  air  expands  and  rises,  this  is  another  criterion  against  thermal  source    ball 
lightning.    Occasionally,  ball  lightning  ascends  faster  than  possible  for  heated  air.  
Masses << 1/3 gm could rapidly ascend and vanish from the atmosphere.  The majority 
of ball lightning observations are of a slow descent.  

4)  Can enter open or closed structures 
The radius of a 3 x 10-4 kg (1/3 gm ) little black hole is RH= 2GM/c2 = 5 x 10-31 
 
m.      Uncharged  little  black  holes  have  mean  free  paths  through  matter  >>  106  km  as 
shown  in  Sec.  13.2,  and  the  mean  free  path  of  charged  black  holes  >  >  meters.    Little 
black  holes  thus  can  easily  penetrate  through  any  material.    Ohtsuki  and  Ofuruton 
(1991) have created plasma fireballs formed by microwave interference in air containing 
ethane and/or methane. These fireballs evidently can penetrate dielectric materials, but 
not  metals.    They  may  have  difficulty  meeting  the  requirement  of  low  optical  power.  
Smirnov (1990) and others have presented strong arguments that ball lightning cannot 
be a plasmoid.  This criterion militates against most models that require external energy 
sources.   

5)  Can exist within closed conducting metal structures  
 
Since little black holes have a more than adequate supply of stored energy they 
can easily exist inside any closed highly conducting structure.  However, this criterion 
dictates  against  models  that  depend  on  electrical  currents,  microwaves,  or  other 
electromagnetic radiation that is shielded out by a conductor.  Microwave models such 
as that of Kapitza (1968), Ohtsuki and Ofuruton (1991) and others would be ruled out in 
this case. 

6)  Levitation 
 
The  little  black  hole’s  downwardly  directed  radiation  accounts  for    steady 
levitation.    It  is  hard  for  other  models  to  account  for  steady  levitation  while  moving 
horizontally for long distances without rising.   

7)  Low power in the visible spectrum  
In the example calculations of Sec. 8,  although a little black hole may emit 300 W 
 
to  106  W  of  total  power  outside  the  visible  spectrum,  it  may  only  produce  ~  10  W  of 
optical  power  by  ionization  of  the  surrounding  air.    The  bulk  of    ball  lightning 
observations (Singer, 1971) suggest that the observed intensities of light and heat are < 
~  10  W  .    This  criterion  rules  out  all  those  models  for  which  the  total  visible  radiated 
power  would  be  far  too  great  for  the  appropriate  color  temperature  of  the    ball 
lightning.    

-20- 

 

 

8)  Rarity of sightings 
 
Almost  everyone  has  seen  lightning,  but  few  people  have  seen  ball  lightning.  
Since little black holes are quite rare, this explains the rarity of sightings.  Many models 
are not in accord with this criterion.  With galactic concentration of the 95%  black hole 
dark matter, ~ 103 little black holes may be expected to be present in steady state in the 
region of  the  earth of volume 1012  km3 (256 cubic  billion  miles) with ~ 1/109 km3 (~1 
per cubic billion miles).     

9)  Relatively larger activity near volcanoes 
 
Relatively  larger  activity  of    ball  lightning  near  volcanoes  has  been  reported.   
Given Trofimenko’s proposal (1990) that LBH are the main source of heat for volcanoes, 
it  follows  that  little  black  hole  caused  ball  lightning  should  be  more  prevalent  there.  
Other models don’t explain this.  

10)  Extinguishes quietly usually  
 
 Ball lightning from little black holes usually extinguishes its luminosity quietly 
when  it  enters  opaque  materials  like  the  ground  or  structures,  slows  down 
considerably, comes to rest, or becomes neutralized.   

11)  Extinguishes explosively occasionally 
   
Ball lightning sometimes releases energy explosively (Singer, 1971).   Little black 
holes  occasionally  extinguish  explosively  as  their  mass  approaches  10-8  kg,  or  when 
otherwise disrupted.  In 1846, lightning accompanied by fire-balls that (cid:147)descended and 
exploded  with  terrific  force(cid:148)  demolished  the  stone  steeple  of  St.  George’s  church  in 
Leicester.   

12)  Related radioactivity 
 
In examining the remains of the steeple apex mentioned in point 11), Mills (1971) 
looked  for,  but  detected  no  radioactivity.    He  considered  that  radioactivity  may  have 
been  undetectable  because  of  the  125  years  time  lapse,  but  may  have  been  detectable 
(cid:147)within  days  of  a  ball  lightning  strike.(cid:148)    Mills  was  testing  the  Altschuler  et  al  (1970) 
model  that  ball  lightning  arises  from  a  concentration  of  short-lived  radioisotopes 
produced  by  lightning.    There  can  be  a  low-level  of  γ-rays,  positrons,  and  other 
radioactivity associated with  ball lightning (Singer, 1993).    
 
Ashby  and  Whitehead (1971) tested the hypothesis that ball lightning  is caused 
by  antimatter  meteorites.    They  made  radiation  measurements  over  the  period  of  one 
year  near  thunderstorms  and  tornadoes  to  check  whether  the  annihilation  of  minute 
fragments  of  meteoric  antimatter  in  the  upper  atmosphere  could  be  the  cause  of  ball 
lightning.      Though  radioactivity  was  detected,  they  seem  to have disproved both the 
Altschuler  et  al  hypothesis  and  their  own  model.    Little  black  holes  can  account  for 
radioactivity,  whereas  most  other  models  cannot.    See  point  15)  below  regarding  the 
recent finding of  γ-radiation for long periods following lightning strikes. 

13)  Typical absence of associated deleterious effects 

-21- 

 

 

Because  of  the  low  interaction  cross  section  of  the  emitted  radiation  and  beam 
 
spreading,  the  total  emitted  GTR  power  from  a  little  black  hole  has  low  local  power 
deposition  and low  power density near the earth, dissipating over a large volume.  As 
analyzed in Secs. 11 -13, most interactions in my GTR model of LBH radiation are not 
detrimental.   

14)  Occasional high localized energy deposition 
Some  ball  lightning  incidents  require  MJ  of  energy  to  account  for  molten 
 
materials and the reported boiling away of a bathtub full of water  (Singer, 1971).  The 
high energy content >> MJ of little black holes can account for this when a little black 
hole is disrupted by an end of life burst. 
 
Dmitriev  et  al  (1981)  report  an  extremely  high,  well  documented,  localized 
energy  deposition  associated  with  an  explosion  observed  by  eye-witnesses  including 
one of the authors:  "The  ball lightning was observed at 11:20 PM on August 23, 1978, in 
Khabarovsk, near Khazian Street, during a heavy rainfall.  A suden whistle was heard 
similar  to  that  produced  by  a  jet  engine.    It  became  as  bright  as  day.    Then,  over  the 
building of the cinema "Zarya" appeared a ball lightning, ~1.5 m in diameter, having an 
intense  orange  color.....  blazing  briefly  on  the  surface  of  the  ground  ....  A  strong 
explosion was heard.... The probability that the observed phenomena had been caused 
by ordinary linear lightning can be practically excluded."   It was estimated that ~ 1.1 x 
109 J was released by the ball lightning in forming molten slag of 440 kg of ground and 
boiling 175 kg of water.   
 

15) Larger Activity Associated With Thunderstorms and Lightning 
 
Thunderstorm  activity  may  be  involved  in  the  charging  of  little  black  holes, 
and/or  the  high  fields  associated  with  thunder  clouds  (Cobine,  1958)  may  attract 
charged little black holes.  During lightning,  runaway high energy charged particles  in 
the  high  energy  tail  of  the  Maxwellian  distribution  have  more  of  a  chance  of  being 
ingested by the black hole due to their shorter de Broglie wavelengths. The potential of 
charged  clouds  may  get  as  high  as  109  V  (Rabinowitz,  1987).    A  startling  recent  
discovery that γ-ray showers lasting from minutes to hours have been detected starting 
in the microseconds aftermath  of  some lightning flashes is reported by Krieger (2004).   
No conventional explanation has been found.  To date, little black holes are as viable an 
explanation to account for this as any other.   

11  Feasible Little Black Hole Geophysical and Astrophysical Processes 

11.1  Overview 
 
 
Many  geophysical  and  astrophysical  processes  are  not  yet  well  understood.  
There would be profound implications if it could be established that LBH are the dark 
matter  of  the  universe,  and  on  rare  occasion  initiate  tremors  and  trigger  quakes.    A 
testable  LBH  model  of    sporadic  tremors  and  quakes  is  explored  to  determine  under 
what conditions LBH may be relevant to geophysical and astrophysical processes.   

-22- 

 

 

Although the  extraordinary  weakness  of  gravity makes  it by far the weakest of 
 
the interactions, viewing little black holes (LBH) as a class of elementary particles puts 
them in a league with hadrons as strongly interacting particles.  They interact strongly 
both  in  the  subatomic  and  macroscopic  realms.  The  weakness  of  gravity  is  illustrated  
by  the  ratio  of  the  gravitational  force    to  the  electric  force  of  2.4  x  10-43  between  two 
electrons (mass 9.1 x 10-31 kg) and 8.0 x 10-37 between two protons (mass 1.7 x 10-27 kg).  
However two little black holes (LBH) each the size of a nucleon (RH ~ 10-15 m) have as 
much mass as a mountain (1012 kg ≈  109 ton), completely turning this ratio around to ~

LBH can be characterized by a few variables such as mass, angular momentum, 
and  electric  charge  just  as  is  done  with  ordinary  elementary  particles.    Nathan  Rosen

In the numerical examples which follow, M ~ 1012 kg is used for illustrating the 
 
passage  of  a  LBH  through  the  earth,  sun,  and  neutron  stars.    For  levitating  in  the 
atmosphere, M <~ 10-3 kg, and as M decreases the LBH is repelled away from the earth, 
long  before  producing  destructive  radiation.    In  my  model  the  LBH  radiation  is  a 
function  of  the  mass  of  the  LBH,  as  well  as  both  the  distance  and  mass  of  the  second 
body  from  the  LBH;  and  is  greatly  attenuated  relative  to  Hawking(cid:146)s.    For  Hawking it 
depends only on the LBH mass and would be 5.70 x 109 W  for M = 1012 kg.  For M = 10-
3  kg,  his  would  be  5.70  x  1039  W  ,  which  is  so  exceedingly  high  that  it  could  cause 
devastation.

A  very  close  encounter  of  two  LBH  would  be  required,  and  as  we  shall  see,  this  is 
highly  unlikely  due  to  the  beamed  radiation  between  them  that  produces  a  repulsive 
force  as shown in Sec. 11.3.2.   
 

Another  argument  that  favors  PR  is  that  the  radiation  is  due  to  a  tunneling 
process  and  not  an  information-voiding  Planckian  black  body  radiation  distribution 
(Rabinowitz,  2003).    Thus  PR    can  carry  information  related  to  the  formation  of  a  BH, 
and  avoid  the  information  paradox  associated  with  Hawking  radiation.    Also  the 
reduced radiation of PR  allows LBH to be candidates for the dark matter, i.e. 95% of the 
missing  mass  of  the  universe.    For  Hawking  that many  LBH  would  make  toast of the 
universe. That is why he concludes that his LBH can(cid:146)t be more than one-millionth of the 
mass of the universe.  Belinski (1995), a noted authority in the field of general relativity, 
unequivocally  concludes  (cid:147)the  effect  [Hawking  radiation]  does  not  exist.(cid:148)    Many 
significant consequences can result from a change in the model of black hole radiation.

This  is  a  universal  attractive  force  that  acts  between  two  identical  black  holes  of  any

with any other force such as electrical, nuclear, etc.  Using the largest force FA, an even

larger  power  P = F A
However, the idea here is to obtain the largest power and the largest forces in a physical 
context  rather  than  just  from  a  dimensionally  proper  combination  of  fundamental 
constants.   
 
The expression (11.5) is only approximate since in my view the close proximity of 
two  BH  distorts  the  horizons  on  the  adjoining  sides  of  the  BH.    In  addition,  the 
Einsteinian  effective  potential  of  a  BH  is  ~  four  times  stronger  than  the  Newtonian 
potential near the BH, although the two are approximately equal for B > 10, i.e. for r > 
10 RH (Rabinowitz, 1999c).  Furthermore, eq. (11.5) neglects the radiative repulsive force 
due to the tunneling radiation between BH, which is discussed next.

Let  us  find  the  LBH  mass  for  which  the  repulsive  and  attractive    forces  are 

The  average  tunneling  mass  is  related  to  the  BH  mass  through  the  BH  temperature: 
m ≈ kT / c 2 ∝ 1/ M  (Rabinowitz,  1999  a).    So  it  is  not  necessary  to  know  in  detail

For B2 Γ →  ~ 1, eq. (10.9) yields M ∅ ~ MPlanck, since Γ
  →    ~ 1 by eq. (11.8).  
Thus F = 1043 N may also be the largest possible repulsive force in nature between two 
masses. (Rabinowitz, 2001 c)  
In  the  very  low  probability  configurational  limit  of  Γ   ~  1  [high  tunneling 
 
probability],  the  form  of  PR  looks  like  the  Hawking  radiated  power  PSH,  with  an 
important  distinction.    PSH  is  omnidirectional  and  does  not  yield  repulsion  in  the 
standard  Hawking  model,  whereas  PR is  beamed between the two  bodies  resulting in 
repulsion.    Two  LBH  must  get  quite  close  for  maximum  tunneling  radiation.    In  this 
configurational limit, there is a similarity between the tunneling model and what may 
be  expected  from  the  Hawking  model  (1974,1975),  in  that  the  tidal  forces  of  two  LBH 
would add together to give more radiation at their interface in Hawking(cid:146)s model.  This 
should  also  produce  a  repulsive  force,  though  somewhat  smaller  than  from  PR , since 
there is also radiation in all directions.

One  should  use  quantum  gravity  for  such  calculations,  but  it  hasn(cid:146)t  yet  been 
 
formulated  despite  decades  of  dedicated  work  on  this  difficult subject.   There may be 
concern regarding the use of semi-classical physics at the Planck scale of ~10-35 m with 
energy ~ 1019 GeV.  However as measured at large distances, the gravitational red shift 
(Rabinowitz, 2003) substantially reduces the impact of high energies near LBH .   
 
11.4  LBH flux in the atmosphere 
 
 
For LBH coming to the earth from an extremely large distance in essentially free 
fall from the edge of the universe (RU ~ 1.4 x 1026 m), by the conservation of energy  we 
can calculate vbh their impact velocity at the earth assuming only free fall:

where  Me=  6.0  x  1026  kg  and  Re=  6.4  x  106  m  are  the  earth(cid:146)s  mass  and  radius.    If  the 
initial  LBH  velocity  vLBH  =  0,  the  impact  velocity  is    vbh  ~  104  m/sec.    This  is  the 
rationale  and  LBH  velocity  used  by  others  in  the  past.    Note  that  by  symmetry  of  eq. 
(11.10), the impact velocity equals the escape velocity. 
However,  a  substantially  larger  velocity  should  be  used.    Since  the  LBH  were 
  
created during  the big bang,  at a large distance from  the earth they should be in the 
cosmic  rest  frame.    The  velocity  of  our  local  group  of  galaxies  with  respect  to  the 
microwave  background,  i.e.  with  respect  to  the  cosmic  rest  frame  (Turner  and  Tyson, 
1999)  is  a  reasonable  velocity  vLBH  ~  6.2  x  105  m/sec  for  the  LBH  with  respect  to  the 
earth at RU.  Thus vbh ♠ vLBH
.  It is interesting that the free fall velocity from rest at RU  
to  the  sun  is  6.2 x 105 m/sec  ≈  vLBH,  where Msun =  2.0 x 1030  kg  and  Rsun =  7.0 x 
108 m are used in eq. (11.10).  For  a  neutron  star using Mn = Msun= 2.0 x 1030 kg, and 
Rn=  104  m,  eq.  (11.10)  gives  vbh  ♠  1.6  x  108  m/sec  ♠  0.5  c,  which  is  close  to  where 
relativistic effects become important.  This should not be surprising as a neutron star is 
close to being a BH, where vbh would be c, the speed of light. 
 
Massive  LBH  have  reduced  GTR  and  at  large  velocities  do  not  slow  down 
appreciably  due  to  their  large  mass  or  angle  of  approach,    and  go  right  through  the 
earth.  (This  interaction  is  covered  in  Sec.  11.4.)    As  will  be  shown,  the  LBH  incidence 
rate matches the estimated BL rate well, but may be too low to account for much quake 
activity unless the heavier LBH are in re-entrant orbits.  
 
In  the  Rabinowitz  model  (1999  a,  b,  c),  those  LBH  that  reach  the  earth(cid:146)s 
atmosphere  and  are  small  enough  to  have  sufficient  radiation  reaction  force  to  slow 
them down to the  range of 10-2  to  102 m/sec with a typical value  vBL ~ 1 m/sec, can 
manifest themselves as BL.  In most cases h/τ << vBL.  So Eq. (9.4) in Sec. 9 implies that 

-27- 

 

 

 

 

 

the ball lightning current in the atmosphere ≈ the LBH current far away.  We can thus 
give a range for the BL flux density as given by eq. (9.5) in Sec. 9:

The distribution of LBH masses is not known.  Assuming that LBH comprise all

roughly in the range:

11.5  Incidence rate of LBH through the Earth 
 
Assuming that 10% of the more massive LBH have an average mass   M LBH  ~ 1012 
 
kg, there are ~ 1040 LBH/ 1079 m3 = 10-39 LBH/m3, and with (Afar/AE) ~ 106 eqs. (9.5) 
and (9.6) imply that the flux of these LBH  through  the earth is ~ 10-27/m2-sec.   Such  
LBH are  too   massive  to    produce   enough  exhaust  radiation  to  linger  in    the 
atmosphere,  and  so  go  right  through  the  earth.    The  earth(cid:146)s  diameter  is  1.3  x  107  m 
which implies that the incidence rate of 1012 kg LBH is ~ (10-13/sec) ~ 1 LBH /105 year.  
This could be augmented if the heavier LBH are in re-entrant orbits.    

11.6  Incidence rate of LBH through the sun   
 
With  an  average  mass    M LBH   ~  1012  kg  for  10%  of  the  more  massive  LBH, 
 
gravitational  focussing  may  increase  their flux  ~  105 times greater than  through  the  
earth  to   ~ 10-22/m2-sec. The sun(cid:146)s diameter is 1.4 x 109 m,  implying an incidence rate 
of ~ 10-9/sec ~ 1 LBH /10 year through the sun, neglecting LBH re-entrant orbits.    

 

 

11.7 Incidence rate of LBH through neutron stars 

With a gravitational  enhancement ~ 1010 with respect to the earth, the flux is ~

Depending  on  the  magnitude  of  the  different  variables,  it  is  possible  to  exceed  the

how much of the energy is partitioned into a shock wave.  This would depend on the 
nature of the part of the earth traversed (e.g. rock, liquid, etc.) and on the magnitude of 
the energy loss and power input per atom.  Thus energy is partitioned differently into

12.2 Gravitationally enhanced ionization parameter 
The  intense  gravitational  field  of  a  LBH  causes  more  atoms  to  be  ionized  than 
 
given  by  only  kinetic  considerations  since  atoms  will  be  gravitationally  captured  in 
orbit around the LBH with the ultimate fate of being ionized even if they do not fall into 
the BH.  This clearly occurs for free particles in the atmosphere, and may also occur if 
matter is temporarily vaporized along the path of a LBH going through the earth.  As 
shown by eq. (6.1) of Sec. 6, the gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m  in 
the field of a LBH is 
V = − GMm

where  p  is  the  permanent  dipole  moment,  and  α

12.3  Minimum impact parameter 
 
 
The  minimum  impact  parameter  is  determined  by  quantum  mechanics  since 
quantum effects smear out the particle and reduce the probability of its ingestion in the 
LBH.  Though different approaches agree that this occurs when the particle is absorbed 
by the LBH, they give substantially different values.  Fortunately this does not make a 

-30- 

 

 

big difference in the LBH energy loss per unit length nor in the total power dissipated 
per  LBH  as  given  by  eqs.  (12.4)  and  (12.5)  since  these  have  a  weak  logarithmic 
dependence ln bmax / b min

). 

(

 

 

 
From  one  point  of  view  a  target  particle  cannot  be  absorbed  in  a  black  hole 
unless its Compton wavelength ≤ the LBH Schwarzchild (horizon) radius RH; and that 
it has a very low probability of being absorbed unless its de Broglie wavelength ≤ RH.  
Thus  bmin ~ λ = h

where the relative velocity between the approximately stationary particle and the LBH 
is  the  velocity  vbh  of  the  LBH.    Equation  (12.9)  would  apply  provided  that  λ  is  the 
shortest length scale in the LBH rest frame.   

Another criterion for absorption applies only to very small LBH.  It is that λ does 
 
not change appreciably in a length scale comparable to itself.  Interestingly, this implies 
that vbh ~ 2GMm/h < c.    Thus for m ~ atomic mass, only  LBH with M < 1012 kg (RH 
=10-15 m) can absorb atoms.  This criterion would not apply for much larger BH.  If this 
criterion  is  correct,  then  even  if  the  classical  orbital  radius  of  the  particle  were  small 
enough to allow it, the particle Compton wavelength for absorption would need to be 
less  than  the  LBH  radius  for  all  BH.    We  can  essentially  set  bmin  =    Compton 
wavelength:

Equation (12.1) indicates that such orbits execute simple harmonic motion with constant

m/sec, r = 5.0 x 108 m >> Re = 6.4 x 106 m.  So an internal orbit inside the earth is not 
possible unless the LBH velocity is greatly reduced.  
2)    For  the  sun  with  an  average  density  of  ρ  =  1.4  x  103  kg/m3,  and  vbh  =  8.7  x  105 
m/sec, r = 1.2 x 109 m > Rs = 7 x 108 m.  So an internal orbit near the limb of the sun 
would almost be possible.    
3)  For a neutron star with an average density of ρ = 4.8 x 1017 kg/m3, and vbh = 1.6 x 
108  m/sec,  r  =  1.4  x  104  m  >  Rn  =    104  m.    So  an  internal  orbit  near  the  limb  of  the 
neutron star would almost be possible.   
 
As  we  shall  see  in  the  next  sections,  velocity  degradation  of  LBH  is  difficult  to 
achieve by ordinary collisional-like interactions because dE/dx is relatively small.  It is 
also  difficult  to  reduce  the  LBH  velocity  by  particle  absorption,  since  LBH  particle 
absorption is a very low probability event, and when it does occur for particle mass m 
<< M, there is hardly any decrease in vbh.   

13.2  LBH interaction in going through the earth   
 
From eqs.  (12.6) and (12.7), with an ionization potential ♠ 15 eV = 2.4 x 10-18 J, 
 
and a LBH velocity of 6.2 x 105 m/sec, 1012 kg LBH have an upper limit bmax= rE ~ 5 x 
♠ bioniz,  then bmax~  10-8  m  as  given  by  eqs.  (12.8)  and  (12.6).    The

or  (12.10),  or    (12.11).    Because  of  the  logarithmic  dependence  it  does  not  make  much 
difference which of these bmax or  bmin is used.   Thus by eq. (12.4)  dE/dx ~ 10-2 J/m in 
going  through  the  earth.    The  overall  density  of  the  earth  is  5.5  x  103  kg/m3  (5.5 
gm/cm3).  The mantle density (first 50 miles in from the surface) is 2.7 gm/cm3.

Equation  (13.4)  implies  that    E = Eoe
.    So  the  range  is  that  path  length  when  the 
LBH  energy  has  fallen  to  1/e  of  its  initial  value,  Eo.  Neglecting  black  hole  decay,  the 
range would be 3 x 1025 m through solid earth of density 5.5 x 103 kg/m3, which is 21% 
of  the  radius  of  the  universe  (RU  ~  1.4  x  1026  m).    To  put  this  into  perspective,  if  the 
earth had a  radius RE ~ 6 x 108 m (100 times larger than its actual radius), then  a LBH 
with vbh = 6. 2 x 105 m/sec in circular orbit just inside this larger earth would make ~ 
1016 revolutions in 1500 billion years i.e. ~100 times longer than the present age of the 
universe.  So orbits that are re-entrant into the core of the earth (as well as the sun and 
neutron stars), could easily persist for almost endless cycles.

From eq. (10.2), the maximum power dissipated in the sun is P ~ 105 W/LBH.  Even at 
this high density the LBH range would be 5 x 1025 m neglecting black hole decay, which 
is  38  %  of  the  radius  of  the  universe.    If  the  sun(cid:146)s  radius  were  1.2  x  109  m  (almost  a 
factor of 2 larger than the actual radius Rs = 7 x 108 m), then a LBH with vbh = 6.2 x 105 
m/sec could be in a circular orbit just inside such a larger sun.  It would make ~ 1016 
revolutions in 2000 billion years i.e. ~130 times longer than the present 13.7  billion-year 
age of the universe.      
 
A  startling  conjecture  was  made  by  Hawking  (1971)  to  account  for  the  missing 
solar neutrino flux (Kim et al, 1993) that a black hole has fallen into the center of the sun 
and  is  gobbling  up  neutrinos.    If  such  a  black  hole  did  not  first  evaporate  away  by 
Hawking radiation, it would eventually cause the sun to collapse.

where we will take the neutron star mass Mn ~ solar mass = 2 x 1030 kg, with a radius

This is 102 MeV which is quite large even compared with nuclear binding energies of 6 -

this view, a LBH can displace a neutron by gravitational interaction as it goes through a 
neutron star. 
 
From  another  point  of  view,  we  may  think  of  the  interaction  of  a  LBH  with  
neutrons as analogous to the interaction of a LBH in ionizing an atom.  A free neutron 
decays into a proton + electron + antineutrino with a half-life of 10.6 minutes.  We may 
think of the ionization potential of a neutron as < ~ mnc2 - mpc2 , the energy difference 
between the neutron and the proton.  Thus ∆En~ 939.56 MeV - 938.27 MeV = 1.29 MeV.  
In this scenario, eq.(12.6) yields bmax ~ 10-12 m.   
)~10, and 
 
eq. (12.4) yields dE/dx ~ 104 J/m for a LBH of M ~ 1012 kg, and a neutron star density 
of  5  x  1014  kg/m3.    The  total  energy  lost  is    104  J/m  (~104  m  )  ~  108  J  per  LBH.    The 
power dissipated is 1.6 x 108 m/sec (104 J/m) ~ 1012 W. 
From  eq.  (13.4),  neglecting  black  hole  decay,  the  range  would  be  ~  1024  m 
 
through  a  neutron  star,  which  is  1%  of  the  radius  of  the  universe.    For  an  orbit  just 
inside  a  neutron star  with Rn ≈ 1.4 x 104 m, a LBH with vbh = 1.6 x 108 m/sec would 
make ~ 1019 revolutions in 0.25 billion year i.e. 1.6 % of the present age of the universe.

14  Devastation of Tungus, Siberia  
 
The devastation of the Tungus region of central Siberia on June 30, 1908, remains 
 
a  mystery  to  this  day,  despite  the  fact  that  there  were  large  numbers  of  eyewitnesses 
and we know precisely when and where this gigantic explosion took place.  A brilliant 
ball  of  fire  crossed  the  sky  and  exploded  in  the  atmosphere  with  a  blast  equivalent  ~ 
1015  to  1017  J  (~30  million  tons  of  TNT)  (Krinov,  1966).    More  cataclysmic  than  a 
hydrogen bomb, the force flattened trees causing them to point radially outward within 
a 40-mile diameter circle; and hurled creatures like horses to the ground more than 400 
miles from Tungus in the area of Kansk.   
 
One  of  the  many  speculations  that  have  been  considered  over  the  years  is  that 
this  destruction  of  an  area  of  more  than  1200  square  miles  was  caused  by  a  ~1017  kg 
LBH of atomic radius 10-10 m (Jackson and Ryan, 1973).  Hawking (1971) proposed that 
the  Tungus  event  resulted  from  the  passage  of  a  small  black  hole  through  the  earth.   

-34- 

 

 

Burns  et  al.  (1976)    conclude  that  "1028  to  1030  erg  [1021  to  1023  J]  of  seismic  energy 
would have been deposited in the Earth... ".  This is not only tremendously greater than 
actually  recorded,  but  greater  than  some  of  the  largest  earthquakes  (~  1017  J)  ever 
recorded.    One  of  the  biggest,  the  1960  Chilean  earthquake,  released  >  ~  4  x  1017  J, 
which is large compared with the average annual seismic energy release of 5 x 1017 J/yr 
= 1.5 x 1010 W (Stacey, 1992).   Burns et al concluded that the Tungus catastrophe could 
not  have  been  caused  by  an  LBH.    Although  Greenstein  and  Burns  (1984)  included 
additional  energy  release  due  to  Hawking radiation  in a later paper (in  Fig.  1 of their 
paper  in  which  the  bion  scale  appears  to  be low) not  related to the Tungus event, this 
was not included in their papers on Tungus.  These papers did not consider that LBH 
might  be  the  missing  mass  of  the  universe,  which  is  a  distinct  possibility  in  the  GTR 
model of LBH radiation as discussed in this Chapter.  
Although the conclusion of Burns et al (1976) may well be correct, one may get 
 
much smaller numbers for the total energy released by an LBH going through the earth 
in Siberia.  From eq. (13.2)  the energy release for the example 1012 kg LBH at 6.2 x 105 
m/sec  in  this  paper  is  only  105  J  with  a  correspondingly  larger  quadratic  effect  for 
larger M LBH.  This large disparity results from the scaling of the energy input, where 
neglecting  the  logarithmic  dependence,  Et  ∝ (M/vbh)2.    They  assigned  the  impact 
velocity vbh ~ 104 m/sec to their 1017 kg LBH.  Jackson and Ryan (1973) used a similarly 
low vbh for their 1017 to 1019 kg LBH in concluding that, (cid:147)total energy in the blast wave 
would be 1022 to 1024 erg  [1015 to 1017 J].(cid:148)  
 As  to  the  large  energy  release  in  the  atmosphere  there  are  other  possibilities 
 
besides  the  impulse  energy  transfer  considered.    These  include  a  charged  LBH,  and 
(even  without  Hawking  radiation)  the  explosive  disruption  of  the  rotational  energy 
outside  an  LBH  because  conservation  of  angular  momentum  prevents  outside  matter 
from falling into the LBH.   
 
Accordingly this intriguing question may not have been decided so conclusively 
as yet.  An LBH may still be ingesting part of Siberia since LBH take millions of years to 
consume objects that are considerably more voluminous than themselves.  However it 
is  more  likely  that  if  it  were  an  LBH,  the  LBH  went  through  the  earth  and  exited.  
Neglecting re-entrant orbits, it is unlikely that a heavy LBH > 1012 kg will come again 
before more than 105 years as indicated by my calculations in Sec. 9 combined with Sec. 
11.4.   So  humankind may not have to worry about such a horrific natural occurrence 
happening for a long time. 

15  Change in Angular Momentum Due to LBH Interaction 

The total vector sum of the angular momentum of an incident LBH, Lbh  plus the 
spin angular momentum S of the target body is conserved because there is no external

15.2  Neutron Star Pulsars 
Neutron  star  pulsars  emit  pulsed  radiation  that  range  from  x-ray  to  radio 
 
frequencies  (Davies,1992).    The  detection  of  polarization  of  the  radiation,  and  of  the 
rotation  of  the  plane  of  polarization  within  a  pulse  was  an  indication  that  a  strong 
magnetic  field  plays  an  important  role  in  the  pulses  as  the neutron star  rotates, much 
like  a  lighthouse  beacon  produces  a  pulse  of  light  in  a  given  direction.    The  general 
tendency of pulsars to slow down, as well as the cyclotron radiation signature of x-ray 
pulsars has been explained in terms of huge magnetic fields ~ 106 to 109 Tesla (1010 to 
1013 G).  It is theorized that when a  star  like the  sun  collapses  rapidly  with  an initial 
magnetic field of 10-2 T, the field gets compressed due to  high conductivity followed by 
a  state  of  extremely    high    temperature    superconductivity,    which    leads    to 
] ~ 10-2 T [(109m)2/(104m)2] ~108 Tesla. 
 

Bfinal
(15.3) 
For a 1012 kg LBH going through a neutron star, with d ~ 0.5 Rn~ 0.5 x 104 m, r ~ 
 
Rn,  by  eq.  (15.2)  ∆Sn  =  -∆Lbh  ~  104  kg-m2/sec.    This  is  a  relatively  small  change  in 
angular  momentum of the neutron  star that  could be  much larger  for a  more massive 
LBH since ∆Sn = -∆Lbh
∝ M2.  Two things may be of interest.  One is that this impulse is 
imparted in a relatively short time ~ Rn/vbh ~ 104 m/1.6 x 108 m/sec ~ 10-4 sec.  This is 
short  compared  with  the  1  to >10  msec period of pulsars.  The second is  that this can 
lead to an increase in the pulsar frequency about half of the time, since roughly half the 
time  the  spin  will  increase  and  half  the  time  the  spin  will  decrease.  The  frequency 
increase  may  be  significant  as  next  discussed,  but  leaves  open  the  question  of 
observation of a decrease. 
 
However  occasionally  there  is  a  sudden  increase  in  frequency,  called  a  starquake, 
followed  by  another  moderate  slowdown  of  the  frequency.    This  process  is  recurrent.  

Dissipative  mechanisms  lead  to  a  gradual  slowdown  of  all  radio  pulsars.

The slowdown time period for most pulsars is 103 to 107 years.   It is thought that the 
abrupt  frequency  increase  is  related  to  a  breakup  of  the  surface  crust  leading  to  a 
decrease  in moment of inertia (Shapiro and Teukolsky, 1983).  However it is  not clear 
that  such  a  rearrangement  including  achievement  of  a  new  equilibrium  position  can 
occur  rapidly  enough,  and  it  cannot  account  for  the  precipitous  frequency  increases 
observed in the Vela pulsar because they occur too frequently (Davies, 1992).   
The latter is also a problem for my LBH spin-up mechanism unless the LBH are 
 
in  re-entrant  orbits  which  go  in  and  out  of  the  neutron  star.    In  a  mechanism  that  is 
similar  in  spirit  to  this,  Stephen  Hawking  (1971)  suggested  that  a  1014  kg  LBH  at  the 
center  of  a  neutron  star  (cid:147)would  produce  a  slight  shrinking  of  the  surface  and  might 
possibly  be  the  cause  of  the  recently  observed  pulsarquakes.(cid:148)  For  his  mechanism  it  is 
also not clear that this process could produce a sufficiently rapid (for most pulsars) and 
frequent (such as Vela) decrease in the pulsar moment of inertia.  Also both  the Shapiro 
and  Teukolsky,  and  Hawking  deformation  mechanisms  should  lead  to  power 
dissipation  of  the  superconducting  currents  that  maintain  the  high  magnetic  field 
(Rabinowitz, 1970, 1971).   

15.3  Earth and Sun 
 
 
Such effects do not appear so clearly on the earth and on the sun because changes 
in  the  rotational  frequency  are  not  as  precisely  and  dramatically  observed.    For  the 
earth a 1012 kg LBH produces ∆Se = -∆Lbh ~ 105 kg-m2/sec.  by  eq.(15.2); and  for the  
sun    ∆Ss  =  -∆Lbh  ~  1010  kg-m2/sec.    Both  are  small  compared  with  the  spin  angular 
momenta of the earth and sun.  With a spin period of 1 day, the earth has Se= 7.2 x 1033 
kg-m2/sec.  For the sun(cid:146)s spin period of 24.7 day, the sun has SS= 1.2 x 1042 kg-m2/sec.  

15.4  Discussion of LBH interactions 
 
 

The  enormous  force  between  BH  at  close  distances  as  scaled  by  RH  is 
surprisingly matched by a comparably large repulsive radiative force as shown in Secs. 
11.3.1  and  11.3.2.    Whether  massive  compact  objects  (herein  called  LBH)  are  indeed 
black holes or Yilmaz (1958, 1982) gray holes should leave much of the analysis of this 
paper unchanged, but would shatter the Hawking model (1974, 1975) which requires a 
black  hole  horizon.    The  Rabinowitz  model  of  LBH  radiation  in  avoiding  the 
unreasonably  high radiation of Hawking, permits LBH to be considered as candidates 
for dark matter in the universe, and ball lightning on earth.   The incidence rate of low 
mass LBH agrees well with the incidence rate of ball lightning.   
 
Sections 12 and 13 have demonstrated that heavy LBH are unlikely initiators of 
seismic  activity  in  the  earth  in  terms  of  frequency  of  occurrence,  unless  there  is  a 
concentration mechanism such as re-entrant orbits.  In terms of magnitude, it would be 
possible for very heavy LBH to contribute to seismic activity in the earth and in neutron 
stars  directly  or  by  triggering  metastable  sites.  Section  15  indicated  that  LBH  are 

-37- 

 

 

capable of  causing abrupt pulsar frequency changes.  A LBH of mass M ~ 1012 kg was 
used in these example calculations.  Since the energy deposition scales roughly as M2, a 
heavier  LBH  can  have  a  correspondingly  bigger  quadratic  effect.    Although  it  is 
unlikely  that  a  LBH  was  responsible  for  the  catastrophic  1908  event  in  the  Tungus 
region of Siberia, analysis in this paper indicates that past conclusions ruling out a LBH 
may  not  be  on  as  firm  a  basis  as  formerly  thought  because  important  input  was 
overlooked.   
 
16  Viable Black Hole Atoms  
 
16.1  Black holes are ideal for making gravitationally bound atoms  
 
 
Ordinary gravitational orbits, such as planetary orbits, are in the high quantum 
number, continuum classical limit.  In considering gravitationally bound atoms (GBA), 
black holes are ideal candidates for the observation of quantization effects (Rabinowitz, 
1990,  2001  a,b),  since  for  small  orbits  very  high  density  matter  is  necessary.  
Furthermore, "A little black hole can trap charge internally and/or externally.  It could 
easily trap  ~ 10  positive or negative charges externally and form a neutral  or charged 
super-heavy atom-like structure (Rabinowitz. 1999a)."  Moderately charged black holes 
could  form  electrostatically  and  gravitationally  bound  atoms.  For  the  present  let  us 
consider  only  gravitational  binding  where  the  black  hole  mass  M  >>  m,  the  orbiting 
mass.    To  avoid  complications  related  to  quantum  gravity,  m  can  be considered to be 
made of ordinary matter such as a nucleon or group of bound nucleons.  We will also 
avoid the complication of the interaction of the orbiting body with GTR from the black 
hole. 
 
Newtonian gravity is generally valid for r > 10 RH since the difference between 
Einstein(cid:146)s general relativity and Newtonian  gravitation gets small in this region. (The 
black hole horizon or Schwarzschild,  radius is RH = 2GM/c2, where M is the mass of a 
black hole and c is the speed of light.)   This approximation should be classically valid 
for all scales since the

.  Thus it is necessary that  V  be smaller 

than 1/20 of the rest energy of the orbiting body of mass m.  
 
16.2  Black hole atoms in the realm of Newtonian gravity 
 
  We will operate in the realm of Newtonian gravity and thus require the orbital 
 
radius    r    >    10  RH.      From  (Rabinowitz,  2003)  eq.  (4.5)  for  3-space  i.e.  n  =  3,    with 
principal quantum number j =1, and M >> m:

where  D C  is the reduced Compton wavelength of the orbiting particle.  So r ≥ 10 RH is

Now let us determine a relationship between M and m that satisfies r ≥  10 RH.

(16.5) 

For M = m, r is a factor of 2 larger from eq. (16.2), and eqs. (16.4) and (16.5) would yield 
M ≤ MPlanck / 10 .  This  is  why  it  would  be  impossible  to  also  avoid  the  realm  of 
quantum  gravity  if  the  two  masses  are  equal  as  is  primarily  done  in  Chavda  and 
Chavda (2002).    
 
We can now determine the ground state orbital velocity v in general for any M 
and  m  that  satisfy  r  ≥    10  RH.      By  substituting  eq.  (16.5)  into  eq.  (4.6)  for  v  from 
(Rabinowitz, 2003) for  n = 3,  with  j =1 and M >> m:

A large range of M >> m can satisfy these equations.  For a numerical example,  
 
let m = mproton = 1.67 x 10-27 kg.  Equation (16.5) implies that M = 6.36 x 1010 kg, with 
RH= 9.43 x 10-17m.  Equation (16.7) gives a binding energy E = 3.76 x 1012 J = 23.5 MeV, 
with v = 6.72 x 107  m/sec. We want the binding energy E >> kT, so T must be << 2.72 x 
1011K.    Since  this  is  much  less  than  the  unification  temperature  Tunif  ~  1029  K,  such 
atoms would not be stable in the very early universe.  However if they were formed at 
later  times,  they  could  be  stable  over  most  of  the  age  of  the  universe,  assuming 
negligible Hawking radiation  (Rabinowitz, 1999 a and 2001 a, b).  
 
16. 3  Gravitational fine structure or coupling constant 
 
 
Just as the coupling in an ordinary electrostatic atom can be characterized by the 
electromagnetic  fine  structure  constant,  α,  we  can  also  characterize  the  coupling  in  a 
gravitational  atom  by  a  gravitational  fine  structure  constant,  αG.    However  the 
designation of what αG should be, is not nearly as clear as the designation of α. The fine 
structure  constant,  α,  is  a  dimensionless  coupling  constant  that  characterizes  the 
relatively  weak  electromagnetic  interaction.    The  measure  of  the  strength  of  the 
interaction between any two particles is given in general by the dimensionless ratio: 
 
[mutual force acting on the particles]x [square of the distance between them] . 
 
 
This measure is called the (cid:147)coupling constant(cid:148) for the particles concerned.   
 
and +e spaced distance r apart is   
F = − e2

observed a gravitational atom -- much less one with two proton masses orbiting around 
each other.

A  lesson  from  this  is  that  even  though  the  gravitational  force  (or  coupling)  is 
 
thought of as being the weakest force, it can be the strongest of them all since it does not 
saturate.  It depends on how much mass is involved.  
 
17  Holeum Instability 
 
Chavda  and  Chavda  (2002,  p.  2928)  propose  that  black  holes  and  holeum  are 
created,  "When  the  temperature  of  the  big  bang  universe  is  much  greater  than  Tb  = 
mc2/kB,  where  m  is  the  mass  of  a  black  hole  and  kB  [  k  here]  is  the  Boltzmann 
constant...."  Let us examine whether the binding energy is great enough to hold holeum 
together  in  this  high  temperature  regime.    The  binding  energy  between  the masses m 
and m is given by j = 1 in (Rabinowitz, 2003) eq.(4.8) for 3-space, n = 3. In order for the 
binding energy given by eq. (4.8) to be large enough to hold the holeum atom together 
for high energy collisions in this regime, it is necessary that

Equation (17.2) says that masses >> the Planck mass are needed for holeum to be 
stable  in  this  high  temperature  regime.    This  is  incompatible  with  their  position  (p. 
2932) that they are dealing with black holes less than the Planck mass, "In this paper, we 
consider  black  holes  in  the  mass  range  103  GeV/c2  to  1015  GeV/c2."    This  limits  the 
black  hole masses  from  10-24  kg to 10-12  kg,  compromising the stability of holeum by 
tens of orders of magnitude.  Both  for  stability and to circumvent the need for a theory 
of  quantum  gravity,  masses  ≥  2  x  10-8  kg  =  mPlanck  are  required.    But  this  brings  in 
problems of too small an orbital radius as shown next.

(17.4) 

For a stable orbit, f =  2 , as determined by eq. (17.2).  This implies that r = RH/4 . This 
is inconsistent with their use of Newtonian gravity (NG) which requires r > 2 RH just to 
avoid  collision  between  the  orbiting  black  holes.    In  NG,  for  equal  black  hole  masses, 
each LBH orbits at a radius r/2 about the center of mass of the atom.  For r > 10RH, NG 
requires  f    <    1/101/4  =    0.56,  but  then  the  masses  are  each  0.56  MPlanck  ,  requiring 
quantum  gravity.    For  some  cases  they  have  2RH  <  2  r  <  10RH  ,  which  is  still  not 
adequate. 
Higher dimensional atoms will not alleviate this conundrum for the mass or the 
 
radius, as shown in (Rabinowitz, 2003).  The way out of this problem is shown in Sec. 16 
to  have  the  mass  M  be  a  little  black  hole  which  is  massive,  yet  with  RH  <<  r,  and  an 
ordinary  orbiting  mass  m  <<  MLBH.    Note  that  higher  dimensional  bodies  in  n-space 
could be stable if they are like nucleons bound by short-range fields such as the Yukawa 
potential.    The  finding  that  orbiting  bodies  in  atoms  or  planets  cannot  be  bound  for 
higher  than  3-space  applies  only  to  long-range  fields  like  the  gravitational  and 
electrostatic  fields.    For  the  sake  of  completeness,  we  next  examine  some  of  the 
limitations imposed by higher dimensional space.  

18 Limitations Imposed by Higher Dimensional Space 

18.1  Introduction 
 

-42- 

 

 

 

 

 

Higher  dimensions  clearly  give  more degrees of freedom, but they also impose 
 
unexpected  limitations  and  restrictions.  Some  theories  conjecture  that  accelerated 
expansion  of  the  universe  and  dark  energy  can  be  understood  in  terms  of  higher 
dimensional  space.    This  author  has  earlier  shown  that  angular  momentum  cannot  be 
quantized in the usual manner (radius adjusting itself so that an an integral number of 
wavelengths  can  be  accommodated  in  an  orbit)  in  4-space  because  the  radius  cancels 
out  of  the  dynamic  equations  (Rabinowitz,  2003).  This  leads  to    novel  opportunities 
such  as  the  quantization  of  mass.      Now  a  distinct  derivation  will  be  presented  that 
stable gravitational or electrostatic orbits are not possible for spatial dimensions n ≥ 4.  
Atoms  and  planets  cannot  be  bound  in  higher  dimensions.    String  theory  may  be 
impacted  since  the  unfurled  higher  dimensions  of  string  theory  will  not  permit  the 
existence  of  stable  atoms.    String  theory  with  compacted  dimensions    may  even  be 
incompatible  with  accelerated  expansion  of  the  universe.    The  search  for  deviations 
from  1/r2  of  the gravitational force  at  sub-millimeter distances  may  also  be  impacted.   
Nevertheless,  I  do  not  view  string  theory  as  an  exercise  in  metaphysics.    Finkelstein 
(1997) said that compacted dimensions (cid:147)could have physical meaning... .(cid:148)  I agree with 
this,  and  think  that  taking  string  theory  seriously  also  involves  questioning    it 
strenuously,  as  well  as  considering  the  limitations  imposed  by  higher  dimensional 
space. 
 
A  reasonable  question  to  ask  of  any  compacted  higher  dimensional  theory  is: 
 
What  would  the  universe  be  like  if  the  compacted  dimensions  unfurl  to  macroscopic 
dimensions?  This paper attempts to answer this question by a novel demonstration that 
gravitational  and  electrostatic  orbits  are  not  stable  for  spatial  dimensions  n  ≥  4.    It  is 
thus  shown  that  in  higher  dimensional  space  atoms  cannot  exist  and  that  planetary 
motion  is not  possible.    For  convenience some previously derived results will be used 
(Rabinowitz, 1990 and 2003).   

18.2  No energetically bound circular orbits for n > 3 in n-space   
 
 
We will first examine circular orbits for n ≥ 3, and then build from these results 
to  reach  the  same  conclusion  for  general  orbits.    Gravitational  and  electrostatic  long-
range attractive forces can be expressed in n-space  n = 3, 4, 5, ...

attractive  force,  both  classically  and  quantum  mechanically,  as  quantization  will  not 
change the sign of the co-factor    K n / r n
.   For a bound orbit in 3-space, E3 must be 
negative, i.e. < 0.  It is a little more complicated in higher dimensions to determine if an 
orbit is bound.  Let’s look at this next.

18. 3 Non-circular orbits in higher dimensions  
 
In  higher  dimensional  space  central  force  trajectories  are  generally  neither 
 
circular,  nor  elliptical, as  the  orbits become non-closed curves.  The derivation in this 
paper  is  general,  and  differs  from  the  approach  taken  long  ago  by  Ehrenfest  (1917, 
1920),  notwithstanding  some  similarities.    We  next  show  that  for  n  ≥  4,  circular orbits 
must be at the peak of the effective potential energy curve V’ (cf. Fig. 1) and hence are 
unstable.  The general case can be put in the form of a one-dimensional radial problem 
in terms of the effective potential energy of the system,  
+ L2 / 2mrn

where  Vn(r)  is  the  potential  energy  of  the  system,  and  L  is  the  conserved  angular 
momentum.

Let’s  first  look  at    En  non-relativistically  by  means  of  the  uncertainty  principle

We can conclude from eq. (18.14) that for n ≥ 4, and r small enough to make En < 0, the 
orbiting body would spiral in to r = 0 both quantum mechanically and classically since 
then  the  negative  potential  energy  term  dominates  in  eq.  (18.14).      For  large  kinetic 
energies, this needs to be checked relativistically, which will be done next.   
Let us look at En by means of the uncertainty principle with   r ~ ∆x , and 
 
the relativistic energy equation :

eq. (18.15) indicates that for n ≥ 4 and r small enough to make En < 0, the orbiting body 
would  spiral  in  to  r  =  0  both  quantum  mechanically  and  classically  since  then  the 
negative potential energy term dominates in eq. (18.15). 
 
Therefore  quantum  mechanically  for  n  ≥  4,  orbits  of  any  configuration  are  not 
’ (rm ).    However,  since  they 
bound.  Classical  orbits  can  exist  in  the  region  0 < En
would be subject to quantum tunneling as depicted in Fig. 1, classical orbits would only 
be metastable.  For n ≥ 4 and r small enough to make En < 0, the orbiting body would 
spiral in toward the center of force at r = 0 both quantum mechanically and classically 
since then the negative potential energy term dominates in eqs. (18.14) and (18.15).

18.4  Discussion 
 
 
A  framework  combining  hierarchy  theory  (Dirac,  1937  and  1938)  and  string 
theory was proposed by postulating the existence of 2 or more compact dimensions in 
addition  to  the  standard  3 spatial dimensions that we commonly experience (Argyres, 
1998).  In  this  view,  gravity  is  strong  on  a  scale  with  higher-dimensional  compacted 
space,  and  only  manifests  itself  as  being  weak  on  a  macroscopic  3-dimensional  scale. 

-46- 

 

   

 

One prediction (Arkani-Hamed, 1998) is that if  there are only 2 compacted dimensions 
of  compacted  radius  rc  ~  10-2  cm,  it  should  be  possible  to  detect  a  deviation  of  the 
Newtonian 1/r2  force law at this scale. It has been shown in this paper that for rc ~ 10-8 
cm,  common  electrostatically  bound  atoms  would  not  be  stable,  so  a  deviation  of  the 
Newtonian 1/r2  force law may not occur above this scale.  To say that the electrostatic 
force is stuck on the brane and makes atoms stable seems only definitional. 
Most  variations  of  string  theory  only  modify  gravity  at  short  distances.    Since 
 
they leave gravity unchanged on a large scale, they do not even address the question of 
cosmic  expansion.    Standard  string  theory  may  even  be  discrepant  with  respect  to 
accelerated cosmic expansion.  Why are 6 to 7 of the dimensions tightly curled and our 
three unfurled?  Is extra energy needed to stabilize the tautly wound dimensions?  Or 
are  they  like  abstract  deBroglie  waves  wound  around  atomic  orbits,  that  seem  not  to 
care whether they follow a line, a circle, an ellipse, etc.   
 
It has been shown that neither gravitational nor electrostatic quantized  orbits are 
stable  for  spatial  dimensions  n  ≥  4  no  matter  how  strong  the  attractive  force.  Even 
’ (rm ),  they  would  only  be 
though  classical  orbits  can  exist  in  the  region  0 < En
metastable as they would be subject to tunneling through the effective potential energy 
barrier which has a finite width.

19  Black Holes and Entropy of the Universe 

 

 

19.1  Bekenstein entropy     
 
 
In 3-dimensional space Bekenstein (1972 , 1974) found that the entropy of a black 
∝ kAc3 / Gh . It is ironic that the prime critic of Bekenstein’s 1972 conception  
hole is  Sbh
was Stephen Hawking (1975 ),  who  embraced  the  concept three years later and found 
the constant of proportionality to be 1/4 so that

where A is its surface area, M is the mass of the black hole, MPl

statistical  mechanical  entropy  of  a  system  containing  Ns  distinct  states.  It  is  not  clear 
= k ln Ns . 
what distinct  black hole states are being counted by Ns in the expression   Sbh
A further problem is that since entropy and temperature are statistical quantities dealing 
with  many  bodies,  what  does  it  mean  to  speak  of  them  with  respect  to  a  black  hole 
viewed  as  a  single  body,  which  is  all  that  the  Schwarzschild  solution  deals  with.    But 
these oversights seem not to have been a deterrent.   The 4π  in eq. (19.1) seems out of 

≡ ch / G

-47- 

 

 

 

place  and  aesthetically  incongruous  with  the  statistical  entropy  k ln Ns ,  so  that  it  is 
tempting to leave it out, and I haven’t always resisted this temptation in the past.   
 
It  follows  from  Bekenstein’s  formulation  that  the  entropy  of  black  holes  is 
tremendously  greater  than  the  entropy  of  ordinary  bodies  of  the  same  mass.    For 
example,  our sun of mass 2 x 1030 kg (~ 1057 nucleons) and radius ~ 109 m (~106 miles) 
has entropy    S ≈ 1057 k ≈ 1035 J / K , whereas a black hole of the same mass has entropy 
≈ 1076k ≈ 10 53 J/ K , 1018 times higher with a radius of only ~ 103 m (~1 mile).  If the 
  Sbh
universe  were  95%  full  of  such  black  holes,  there  would  be  1023  of  them  with  a  total 
entropy of 1099 k ≈1076 J/K.  This represents an excess entropy of 1041 times that of our 
universe  if  it  were  filled  with  stars  like  our  sun.    Thus  there  is  a  colossally  higher 
entropic probability that the big bang produced black holes dominantly over ordinary 
matter.  This is a possible partial solution to the conundrum of why the early universe 
appears to have so little entropy, because most of its entropy is hidden in black holes.   
It appears likely that a large percentage of the mass of the universe is composed of little 
black holes according to my model since they do not evaporate away nearly as fast by 
gravitational  tunneling  radiation  (GTR)  as  by  Hawking  radiation.    Interference  with 
nucleosynthesis  is  not  an  issue  for  GTR,  as  it  would  be  for  Hawking  radiation  which 
would  dissociate  big  bang  nucleosynthesis  products,  ruining  the  presently  agreeable 
predictions  of  light  element  abundances.    One  may  well  expect  LBH  to  be  a  major 
constituent  of  the  remnants  of  the  big  bang,  but  can(cid:146)t  be  according  to  Hawking 
radiation, since they would have evaporated away long ago.  
 
The  precise  entropy  increase  over  that  presently  inferred  depends  on  the 
distribution of LBH masses and that of ordinary matter.  The LBH entropy is sensitive 
to the mass distribution as it depends on M2 per LBH.  For example if we consider that 
95% of the universe was initially composed of 1020 kg LBH with radius of only 10-7 m, 
there  would  be  ~  1033  such  LBH,  each  with  entropy  of  1033  J/K  (1056  k)  with  a  total 
entropy of 1066 J/K (1089 k).  This is still impressively high.  

19.2  Entropy of the universe 
 
 
Generalizing  Bekenstein(cid:146)s  equation  by  using  the  n-space  black  hole  horizon 
radius RHn as given by eq. (29) in (Rabinowitz, 2001 b),  the entropy of a black hole in n-
space is

If Gn were known, it would be possible to determine n, the dimensionality that would 
maximize the entropy of the universe treated as if it were a black hole.   
Penrose (1987) insightfully raised a crucial question, that in my opinion has not 
 
been answered to this day.  He pointed out that because the big bang model requires an 
extremely  small  initial  phase  space  volume,  the  initial  entropy  of  the  universe  is 
exceedingly small.  This presents a critical problem for inflation theory which has been 
so widely  accepted in spite of  also  employing speeds greatly in access  of  the speed of 
light.  Measurements of cosmic microwave background density fluctuations are not all 
in support of inflation.  The conundrum of why the early universe appears to have so 
little  entropy  may  only  in  part  have  a  solution  in  that  LBH  would  give  it  a  larger 
entropy.  Their  strongly  repulsive  radiation  because  of  their  primordial  proximity 
would cause rapidly accelerated expansion.  
Black  hole  (cid:147)no-hair(cid:148)  theorems  state  that  black  holes  can  be  completely 
 
characterized by a few variables such as mass, angular momentum, electric charge, and 
magnetic  charge  (monopoles).  [10]    But  is  this  true  at  all  scales?    Perhaps  the  minute 
dimpling  of  a  black  hole(cid:146)s  surface  on  the  scale  of  the  Planck  area  by  gravitational 
perturbations  due  to  external  matter  of  the  rest  of  the  universe  can  contribute 
significantly  to  a  black hole(cid:146)s entropy.  For completeness, if the universe  were a black 
hole, one should also take into consideration the entropy inside it as well as the entropy 
associated  with  its  horizon  area.  In  3-dimensions  for  a  total  mass  M  composed  of  N 
smaller black hole masses, the internal entropy

decreases substantially as N gets large.   
 
19. 3  Contrasting views of black hole entropy 
 
 
Since  there  is  not  the  least  experimental  confirmation  of  what  the  entropy  of  a 
black  hole  is,  it  is  only  fair  to  look  at  some  alternate  views.    Some  argue  that 
Bekenstein’s  expression  must  be  incorrect  since  it  is  not  an  extensive  quantity 
proportional  to  the  sum  of  individual  entropies  as  is  ordinary  entropy.    Dunning-
Davies (2003)  criticizes the accepted black hole entropy with conviction, "...  the entropy 
being an extensive quantity [∝ M], which the accepted black hole entropy expression (1) 

-49- 

 

 

Winterberg (1994) derives an expression similar to that of Bekenstein, except that 

most certainly isn(cid:146)t."  Such an assertion should not be dismissed out of hand, and it will 
be considered in Sec. 20.   
 
for him the black hole entropy is proportional to the (3/4) power of the area instead of 
being proportional to the area of the black hole.  Thus for a solar mass black hole 
instead of an entropy of  1076 k, Winterberg’s entropy would be 

Sbh ~ 1076(

)3/4

k = 10 57k .   

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

(19.5) 

 
For a body with an ensemble of N particles, the statistical mechanical entropy S ≈ Nk 
(within a logarithmic factor).  So eq. (19.5) is approximately equal to the statistical 
mechanical entropy for the sun ,  which has ~ 1057 baryons.   
 
 
Perhaps the view most in opposition to orthodox black hole entropy is that of 
H(cid:252)seyin Yilmaz (1958, 1982), for whom there is none.  Jacob Bekenstein (1972 , 1974) 
conceived of black hole entropy in response to the conundrum posed to him by John 
Wheeler:  What happens to entropy that is put inside a black hole?  Does the entropy of the 
universe go down?  For Yilmaz this is a non-sequitur since in his modification of 
Einstein’s general relativity, there are no black holes --  at best there are only very dense 
grey holes.   

20  In Search of Novel Black Hole Entropy 

20. 1  A rough but simple heuristic derivation of black hole entropy 
 
Black hole entropy should be compatible with thermodynamic entropy.  So our 
 
starting  point  will  be  the  standard  thermodynamic  definition  of  entropy  and  my 
approach will be heuristic rather than rigorous at this time: 

≡ dQ
∫
T

Sbh
  

≤ Mc2

T .   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(20.1) 

 
It  is  clear  that  prior  to  the  acceptance  of  black  hole  radiation,  eq.  (20.1)  would  be  in 
trouble  since  a "truly  black" black  hole must have T = 0, or it would radiate.  Thus its 
entropy would be infinite for any finite mass, with the strange possibility that only an 
infinite  mass  black  hole  might  have  a  finite  entropy.    Bardeen,  Carter,  and  Hawking 
(1973)  considered  their  effective  black  hole  temperature  as  not  real.    For  the  real 
temperature, they averred (cid:147)the effective temperature of a black hole is zero ... because 
the time dilation factor [red shift] tends to zero on the horizon.(cid:148) Particles that originate 
at  or  outside  the    horizon  of  an  isolated  black  hole  must  lose  energy  in  escaping  the  
gravitational  potential  of  the  black  hole.      Temperature  could  be  inferred  for  an  LBH 
from  the  energy  distribution  of  emitted  particles.    In  GTR  there  is  relatively  little  red 
shift, as the particles tunnel through the barrier with undiminished energy.  What little

Planck area, also dubbed the Wheeler area by Jacob Bekenstein (1972, 1974) in honor of 
John Archibald Wheeler.  Since as Bekenstein’s thesis advisor, Wheeler encouraged him 
in  the  derivation  of  the  black  hole  entropy  equation,  which  was  a  brilliant  theoretical 
accomplishment.   Bekenstein made  statistical arguments [in the last form of eq. (20.3)] 
that the factor was   (ln2)/ 8π = 0.0276, rather than the 1/4 obtained by Hawking (1975),  
which  increased  the  entropy  by  an  order  of  magnitude  without  experimental 
consequence.

of  the  black  hole  size,  much  like    T → 0   gives    Sbh
Perhaps another way of intuiting this, is that a particle of mass M can only be confined 
= h/ mc ≤ RH .    Or  equivalently, 
within  RH    if  its  reduced  Compton  wavelength   
→ 0 , an infinite number of such particles could be contained 
MPl
in any size black hole.  If this is not completely satisfying, this may motivate the reader 
for a better answer.  Or better yet, a better expression for   Sbh .   
It  may  also  be  troubling  that  according  to  conventional  wisdom,  it  would  be 
 
easier  for  a  black  hole  to  swallow  a  very  large  and  hugely  massive  object  with 
>> RH .    It  would  take  a  long 
Dc
time for the black hole to ingest the large massive object, and the uncertainty principle 
may prevent a very low mass particle from ever being devoured.  The latter does seem 
anti-intuitive, but so do many things in the quantum realm.  
As discussed in Sec. 19.2, one criticism  of eq. (20.3) is that it is not an extensive 
 
quantity.  That  is,  when  one  puts  two  black  holes  together  to  form  one  black hole, the 
total entropy of the new combined system is not the sum of the two separate entropies. 
It would be if Sbh were proportional to M and hence RH, rather than M2 or (RH)2.  Nor 
do I think it should be extensive, as one would expect the entropy to increase in such an 
irreversible  process  as  the  coalescence  of  two  black  holes  (Bekenstein  1972)  .    What  is

surprising,  is  that  my  heuristic  derivation  started  from  the  standard  thermodynamic 
definition  of  entropy,  which  is  extensive,  and  yet  the  final  result  is  not  extensive  
because of the inverse relation between temperature and mass in black holes.   

20.2  Extensive black hole Entropy 
 
 
There are a lot of ways that one could write Sbh  to give the Bekenstein black hole 
entropy  in  the  limit  of  large  M,  and  to  be  approximately  extensive  for  small  M.    An 
example of one of the simplest is:

Though such an expression may not be consistent with current theoretical thinking, it is 
perfectly compatible with experiments -- of which there are none.  

20.3   Surface dimpling contribution to black hole entropy 
 
Another  possible  criticism  of  the  entropy  equation  is  that  it  does  not  take  into 
 
consideration  dimpling  of  the  black  hole  surface,  like  an  orange  skin  around  the 
horizon.    In  simple  Newtonian  terms,  one  may  think  of  the  black  hole  surface  as  an 
equipotential surface.  Viewed this way, one would expect the surface to be rough due 
to  the  presence  of  matter  throughout  the  universe,  notwithstanding  Wheeler’s  maxim 
that black holes have no hair (Rabinowitz 1999 b).  The question is whether this dimpling 
makes a negligible or appreciable contribution to the area of the black hole, and hence 
to  its  entropy.    The  Planck  area  is  a  very  small  scale,  so  one  might  not  expect  much 
contribution  from dimpling, but it is better to make at least a rough calculation rather 
than none at all. 

20.3.1  Planck size entropy dimples 
 
  
One  tempting  possibility  that  seems  to  follow  from  Bekenstein  black  hole 
entropy is that space is quantized, with the smallest length being the Planck length, lp , 
or  the  smallest  area  being  the  Planck  area.    If  we  take  this  point  of  view,  then  the 
dimples that may  contribute to black hole entropy can at the smallest be of radius  lp/2.  
Then the maximum number of Planck dimples (spheres) would be

be quite fundamental, it may not be all that fundamental.  So much of what is going on 
in modern physics, such as String theory and Loop Quantum Gravity, is centered 
around the Planck scale.  Yet there appears to be no convincing argument that it is more 
fundamental than other comparably small or smaller scales.  Of course if the 
normalization factor remained 
would be independent of Dc as given by eq. (20.7).    
= Dcu ,  eq.  (20.9)  would  give  a  really  big  entropy!    Such  a 
 
    Dc
enormously large entropy for the early universe would go a long way to answering the 
Penrose  (1987)  incisive  observation  that  the  entropy  of  the  nascent  universe  is 
unexplainably  too    low.    It  also  addresses  his  very  important  insight  from  another 
perspective,  in  saying  that  the  entropy  of  the  universe  has  not  increased  that  much, 
because  it was  already much higher than expected. However, It would be open to the

criticism  that  it  is  unfairly  big  because  the  number  of  dimples  exceeds  the  number  of 
particles in the universe.   
 
So in the interest of fairness, let us consider an average dimple producing mass, 
Md .  Then the maximum number of dimples is limited to the ratio Mu/Md. With this 
limitation,  eq. (20.9) becomes

Though smaller, this is still a formidably large entropy.  It would be smaller if a mass

All the above Newtonian type calculations would need to be done in the context 
of  general  relativity.    But  that would  be  gilding  the lily.   The purpose  of  these simple 
alternative  entropy  expressions  is  not  to  present  them  as  being  rigorous,  or  as  a 
challenge  to  Bekenstein  entropy,    which  has  been  solidly  defended  with  theory  and 
good  thought  experiments.    However,  they  have  a  certain  degree  of  unavoidable 
circularity  to  them  since  they  need  to  be  self-consistent  within  a  given  framework.  
These  expressions  are  presented  to  show  that  as  long  as  there  is  no  experimental 
evidence, many options are possible.  Even doing them using general relativity may not 
be the last word.  General relativity becomes highly non-linear in the region of a black 
hole, and even Einstein was concerned about general relativity solutions in this context.  
 
21  General Discussion 
 
 
The  momentum  transfer  of  beamed  GTR  can  either  be  the  main  mechanism  or 
just  contribute  to  the  accelerated  expansion  of  the  universe.    As  the  universe  gets  old 
and the LBH radiate away to nothing,  GTR predicts that the accelerated expansion of 
the  universe  will  slow  down,  and  eventually  the  acceleration  will  cease.    This  is  in 
contrast to the incessant exponential accelerated expansion of the universe that may be 
obtained  from  a  positive  cosmological  constant,  Λ,  of  Einstein’s  general  relativity.  A 
positive  Λ  predicts  that  the  universe  will  endlessly  expand  quicker  and  quicker  to  a 
bleak future.  In this bleak future, in ~ 1011 years, this unbridled expansion would result 
in a universe in which only ~ 102 galaxies  not far from the earth would be visible to us.  
The  further  ones  would  experience  a  relativistic  red  shift  that  would  move  their  light 
from the visible into frequencies too low to be seen.    
 
Most  approaches  to  the  accelerated  expansion  of  the  universe  have  been  to 
invoke  the  cosmological  constant  of  EGR  or  modify  EGR.  Many  modify  our 
conventional concepts of space-time.  This amounts to modifying gravity.  My approach 
may be the only one that does not modify gravity. Which one is correct?  I’d like to say 
that mine is,  but  it  is too soon to tell. The more things a given theory can explain, the 

-54- 

 

 

better.  Mine explains many  things.   Some  approaches  do little  more than address the 
accelerated expansion without tying into other things. Sometimes things are so tightly 
bound that if one things falls the whole unravels.  Fortunately that is not the case here, 
if the correlations are not borne out, my main idea of Gravitational Tunneling Radiation 
still  holds.    If  the  many  correlations  are  borne  out,  then  it  makes  GTR  very  likely.  
However, ultimately GTR needs to be experimentally judged on its own.   
 
The  accelerated  expansion of the universe notwithstanding,  the  laws  governing  
gravity  are  mature,  are  closely  confirmed  by  experiment,  and  appear  to  be  well 
understood.  On the other hand, the thermodynamics and in particular the entropy of 
general gravitational systems leaves much to be desired.  Their ability to self-organize 
seems  to  be  at  odds  with  the  second  law  of  thermodynamics  in  that  the  apparent 
entropy of the system decreases.  Perhaps if we look closely enough, or properly modify 
the entropic concept, the overall entropy will be found to increase.  Our view of entropy 
may  have  to  be  as  pliable  as  our  view  of  the  conservation  of  energy.    There  are  also 
those who argue that the principle that entropy can only increase cannot be applied to 
the  entire  universe.    For  them  such  an  extension  is  an  unwarranted  extrapolation 
founded on neither fact based on experience, nor on indisputable principle. 
Though  black  holes  are  far  from  being  well  understood,  the  general  orthodox 
 
view is  that  black hole entropy is  on a  firm  and well understood basis.  Nevertheless,  
we should be vigilant, lest we become too complacent to challenge common consensus. 
Black  hole  entropy  does  not  represent  a  quantum  limitation  to  entropy,  but  rather  a 
quantum extension of the entropy concept.  Part of this Chapter has probed some of the 
implications  of  black  hole  entropy  in  3-space  and  higher  dimensions,  its  malleability, 
and  the  entropy  of  the  universe  in  n-space.    Black  hole  entropy  may  prove  to  be  as 
malleable  as  the  conservation  of  energy  has  in  the  past  so  that  whenever  a  violation 
threatened, a new kind of energy was legitimately found to save it.   
 
Beamed  black  hole  radiation  in  GTR  is  key  to  my  model  for  accelerated 
expansion of the universe.  The history of black hole radiation is not unlike the history 
of  many  other  important  developments  in  science.    Though  Hawking  is  generally 
credited  with  the  monumental  concept  that  black  holes  can  radiate,  the  credit  should 
really go to Yakov Zel(cid:146)dovich.  Zel(cid:146)dovich (1971) proposed the first model of radiation 
from  a  black  hole,  (cid:147)The  rotating  body  [black  hole]  produces  spontaneous  pair 
production [and] in the case when the body can absorb one of the particles, ... the other 
(anti)particle  goes  off  to  infinity  and  carries  away  energy  and  angular  momentum.(cid:148)  
This is quite similar to the model proposed  by Hawking  (1974) for radiation from non-
rotating  black  holes.    This  relevant  prior  work  by  Zel(cid:146)dovich  was  not  referenced  by 
Hawking in his original papers (1974, 1975), though he did reference some other work 
by Zel(cid:146)dovich.  Neither Hawking nor Zel(cid:146)dovich radiation has been detected, nor could 
either  contribute  to  accelerated  expansion  of  the  universe  because  they  would  be 
isotropic. 
 
22  Conclusion 
 

-55- 

 

 

Dark matter/dark energy is one of the deepest and darkest enigmas of modern 
 
science.  The discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe raises the question: 
What is causing this universal speedup?  And nobody knows what or why?  Theorists 
were  quick  to  coin  the  term  "dark  energy"  in  concert  with  the  already  existing 
conundrum of "dark matter."  The two have been  considered  as separate entities where 
dark energy is the cause of the accelerated expansion of the universe; and dark matter is 
the glue  that holds  the  universe,  or at least galaxies together.   In my model, both are 
essentially the same, or due to the same source i.e. little black holes (LBH).  As 95% of 
the  mass  of  the  universe,  LBH  essentially  hold  the  universe  together  gravitationally, 
and their directed radiation causes its accelerated expansion.  My model is the only one 
in which matter-in-the-universe contributes to it’s accelerated expansion.  All the others 
are rather insensitive to the constituents of the universe. The conventional view is that 4 
-  5  %  is  ordinary  matter,  23  -  25  %  is  dark  matter,  and  about    70  -  73  %  is  exotic 
unknown dark energy unrelated to matter.  
 
Gravitational tunneling radiation of LBH can account for the expansion speedup 
of  the  universe.    Since  the  LBH  are  so  small,  they  are  essentially  smoothed  over  in 
attempts  to  detect  them,  and  so  seem  to  lack  discreteness  (graininess  or  clumpiness), 
giving  the  appearance  of  being  pure  energy.    Einstein(cid:146)s  cosmological  constant  and 
inflation have been considered as explanations. However  a big  cosmological   constant 
makes  the  vacuum  enormously  more  massive  than  is  consistent  with  observation  or 
quantum theory.   Directed radiation from LBH is a possible explanation that does not 
have  these  problems.    For  the  totality  of  LBH  (95  %  of  the  mass  of  the  universe)  this 
radiation is effective in accelerating LBH and the universe outward (Rabinowitz, 2002) -
- yet is considerably less than Hawking radiation that would fry the universe.  In turn 
the  LBH  drag  ordinary  matter  along  with  them  -- such  as  luminous  galaxies  and  the 
stars in them by which we gauge the accelerated expansion.  In our epoch, this radiation 
eventually  escapes    into  the  immense  voids  created  by  the  expansion  of  the  universe, 
and redshifts into invisibility.    
 
The  catastrophic  ruin  of  an  area  of  more  than  1200  square  miles  in  Tungus 
Siberia  on  June  30,  1908    is  not  understood  to  this  day,      The  hypothesis  that  it  was 
caused by a heavy little black hole was prematurely laid to rest by the use of an impact 
velocity  that  was  likely  two  orders  of  magnitude  too  small.  The  disastrous    energy 
discharge  scales  inversely  as  the  square  of  the  impact  velocity.    Thus  they  incorrectly 
concluded  that  several  orders  of  magnitude  too  much  energy  (1015  to  1017  J)  would 
have been released, implying that it could not possibly have been done by a black hole.  
So an LBH may still be slowly gobbling up part of Siberia.  However, my analysis lets 
us end on the more optimistic note that even if it were an LBH, it is much more likely 
that the LBH exited through the earth, and that such devastation by an LBH is not likely 
to happen again for over 100,000 years.

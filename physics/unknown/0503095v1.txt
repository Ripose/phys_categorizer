Abstract. 
 
    Now that an English translation of Schwarzschild’s original work exists, that work 
has become accessible to more people. Here his original solution to the Einstein field 
equations  is  examined  and  it  is  noted  that  it  does  not  contain  the  mathematical 
singularity  normally  associated  with  the  existence  of  a  black  hole.  Einstein’s  own 
views  on  this  subject  are  considered  also  and  it  is  seen  that,  at  the  very  least,  grave 
questions exist over the possible existence of these somewhat esoteric stellar objects. 
 

Introduction. 
 
      In many of the standard textbooks on the General Theory of Relativity [1], time is 
devoted  to  discussing  Schwarzschild’s  solution  of  the  Einstein  field  equations. 
Normally, this solution is stated as being either

where  the  universal  constant  of  gravitation,  G,  and  the  speed  of  light,  c,  have  both 
been  put  equal  to  unity.  Here  r,  q ,  and  f   appear  to  be  taken  to  be  normal  polar  co-
ordinates. 
 
     In the above expressions, a mathematical singularity is seen to occur when r = 0, as 
might be expected for polar co-ordinates. However, due to the form of the coefficient 
of  dr2  ,  it  follows  that  a  second  mathematical  singularity  occurs  when,  in  (1),  rc2  = 
2Gm or, in (2), r = 2m. The first singularity is regularly dismissed as being merely a 
property of polar co-ordinates and, therefore, of no physical significance. The second 
singularity, however, tends  to  have  a  physical interpretation attributed to it - namely 
that it is said to indicate the existence of a black hole. Somewhat ironically, as will be 
seen later, this is referred to as a Schwarzschild black hole. If this interpretation were 
valid, it would imply that, for an object of mass m and radius r to be a black hole, it 
would need to satisfy the inequality 
                                       m/r  ‡
Incidentally,  it  has  always  seemed  fascinating  to  realise  that  this  expression  for  the 
ratio of mass to radius is the same as that derived, using purely Newtonian mechanics, 
by  Michell  in  1784  for  a  material  body  having  an  escape  speed  equal  to,  or  greater 
than, the speed of light [2]. 
 
      As  stated  above,  many  modern  texts  quote  one  of  equations  (1)  or  (2)  as  the 
Schwarzschild  solution  of  the  Einstein  field  equations,  but  is  this  so?  Recently,  an 
English translation of Schwarzschild’s article of 1916 [3], has appeared and this has 
made  the  original  work  accessible  to  many  more  people.  For  this  the  scientific 
community  owes  the  translators,  S.  Antoci  and  A.  Loinger,  a  tremendous  debt  of 
gratitude. It also enables the above question to be raised by more people. 
 
The Schwarzschild Solution.   
 
     An  excellent  discussion  of  the  Schwarzschild  solution  and  its  derivation  is 
provided in chapter eighteen of the little book on the General Theory of Relativity by 
Dirac [4]. Here it is presented in the form (2) above and r, q , and f  are quite clearly 
stated  to  be  the  usual  polar  co-ordinates.  It  is  pointed  out  that  the  case  being 
considered  is  that  of  a  static,  spherically  symmetric  field  produced  by  a  spherically 
symmetric body at rest. After the completion of the derivation, it is noted that the said 
solution holds only outside the surface of the body producing the field, where there is 
no matter and, hence, it holds fairly accurately outside the surface of a star.

      The following chapter is then devoted to the topic of black holes. It is noted that 
the Schwarzschild solution (2) becomes singular when r = 2m and so it might appear 
that that value for r indicated a minimum radius for a body of mass m but it is claimed 
that a closer investigation reveals that this is not so. In the discussion which follows, 
the continuation of the Schwarzschild solution for values of r < 2m is investigated. To 
achieve  this,  it  is  found  necessary  to  use  a  non-static  system  of  co-ordinates  so  that 
components  of  the  metric  tensor  may  vary  with  the  time  co-ordinate.  This  is 
accomplished by retaining q  and f  as co-ordinates but, instead of t and r, using t and r  
defined by 
                                         t  =  t  +  f(r)  and   r   =  t  + g(r),                                   (4) 
where the functions f and g are at the disposal of the investigator. 
 
   It transpires that, for the region r < 2m, the Schwarzschild solution is found to adopt 
the form

. From the actual derivation, it follows that the critical value r = 
where 
2m corresponds to r   - t  =  4m/3 and there is no singularity at this point in this metric. 
 
      From  this  point  onwards,  Dirac’s  argument  becomes  extremely  interesting.  He 
notes that the metric given by (5) satisfies Einstein’s equations for empty space in the 
region  r  >  2m  because  it  may  be  transformed  into  the  Schwarzschild  solution  by  a 
simple  change  of  co-ordinates.  By  analytic  continuation,  it  is  seen  to  satisfy  the 
equations  for  r  £
  2m  also,  because  there  is  now  no  singularity  at  r  =  2m.  The 
singularity now appears, via equations (4), in the connection between old and new co-
ordinates. Dirac then comments that, once the new co-ordinate system is established, 
the old one may be ignored and then the singularity appears no longer. 
  
      He  comments  further  that  the  region  of  space  for  which  r  >  2m  may  not 
communicate with that for which r < 2m. Also, any signal, even a light signal, would 
take  an  infinite  time  to  cross  the  boundary  at  r  =  2m.  Thus,  there  can  be  no  direct 
observational knowledge of the region for which r < 2m. If this argument were true, 
surely the region for which r < 2m would lie outside our universe; would not really be 
a part of it? Dirac calls the region for which r < 2m a black hole but is this an object in 
our  physical  three-dimensional  space  or  one  in  an  abstract,  four-dimensional, 
mathematical space-time? 
 
    Finally,  Dirac  asks  whether  such  a  region  exists  and  notes  that  the  only  definite 
statement  which  may  be  made  is  that  the  Einstein  equations  allow  it.  This  is  a 
question which will be considered further shortly but suffice it to say at this juncture 
that  Einstein  himself  did  not  accept  that  it  existed  physically  [5].  It  is  noted  that  a 
massive stellar object may collapse to an extremely small radius where the forces of 
gravity might become so strong that no known physical forces could withstand them 
and  prevent  further  collapse.  Such  a  situation  would  herald  the  collapse  to  a  black 
hole but, as measured by our clocks, the final state would be achieved only after an 
infinite time. This argument would appear to stem from the ideas of Oppenheimer and 
Snyder  [6].  They  predicted  that,  when  all  sources  of  thermonuclear  energy  were

exhausted,  a  large  enough  star  would  collapse  and  the  contraction  would  continue 
indefinitely  unless  the  star  was  able  to  reduce  its  mass  sufficiently  by  some  means. 
They also made the point that the total time for such a collapse would be finite for an 
observer  co-moving  with  the  stellar  matter,  although  it  would  appear  to  take  an 
infinite time for a distant observer. This was taken to indicate that the star tended to 
‘close  itself  off  from  any  communication  with  a  distant  observer’;  only  its 
gravitational  field  persisting.  Accepting  this  argument  as  valid  for  the  moment,  it 
might be asked, if such an object existed, would it ever be detectable by an external 
observer?  On  the  other  hand,  if  its  gravitational  field  persists,  and  presumably  the 
effects  of  that  gravitational  field  on  the  surroundings,  then,  in  a  sense,  the  star  is 
retaining some contact, albeit indirect, with a distant observer. 
      Also, for very many years, it has been noted that the transformation 

t  =  t  +  u  +  log(r - 2m) 
applied  to  the  Schwarzschild  solution  in  the  form  (2)  would  remove  the  offending 
singularity.  This  was  taken  to  indicate  that  the  singularity  was  mathematical,  not 
physical.  This  conclusion  agrees  with  that  of  Einstein  himself  who,  in  an  article  of 
1939 [5], concluded that the result of the investigation contained in that paper was a 
‘clear  understanding  as  to  why  the  “Schwarzschild  singularities”  do  not  exist  in 
physical  reality’.  He  went  on  to  point  out  that,  his  investigation  dealt  only  with 
clusters whose particles moved along circular paths but he felt it not unreasonable to 
feel  that  more  general  cases  would  have  analogous  results.  He  then  stated  quite 
categorically that ‘the “Schwarzschild singularity” does not appear for the reason that 
matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily’. This seems a very definite rejection of the 
notion of black holes by the very man often heralded as their father. If the general tone 
of his book is an indication of his view, then it seems to be the case that Dirac agreed 
with this interpretation also. This point concerning a possible physical interpretation 
of  a  mathematical  singularity  has  been  raised  previously  by  Loinger  [7],  who  has 
published a number of articles on arXiv in which the non-existence of black holes has 
been claimed. However, what of Schwarzschild himself; it’s his solution of Einstein’s 
equations which is really at the heart of this matter? 
 
Schwarzschild’s Original Solution. 
 
      As noted earlier, the translation of Schwarzschild’s paper of 1916 [3] into English 
has  made  his  work  accessible  to  many  more  people.  In  his  article,  everything  is 
written  initially  in  terms  of  variables  denoted  by  x1,  x2,  x3,  x4 and the point is made 
that the field equations ‘have the fundamental property that they preserve their form 
under  the  substitution  of  other  arbitrary  variables  as  long  as  the  determinant  of  the 
substitution  equals  one’.  The  first  three  of  the  above  co-ordinates  are  then  taken  to 
stand  for  rectangular  co-ordinates,  and  the  fourth  is  taken  to  be  time.  If  these  are 
denoted by x, y, z, and t the most general acceptable line element is then stated, but it 
is noted immediately that, when one goes over to polar co-ordinates according to the 
usual  rules,  the  determinant  of  the  transformation  is  not  one.  Hence,  the  field 
equations  would  not  remain  unaltered.  Schwarzschild  then  employs  the  trick  of 
putting

where r, q , f  are the normal polar co-ordinates. These new variables are then polar co-
ordinates  but  with  a  determinant  of  the  transformation  equal  to  one.  Schwarzschild 
then proceeds to derive his solution and presents it in the form

where 
     Hence, Schwarzschild’s actual solution does contain a singularity when R = a , but 
R is not the polar co-ordinate. It is clearly seen from above that, when R = a , r = 0; 
that is, the singularity actually occurs at the origin of polar co-ordinates, as is usual. 
Therefore, according to Schwarzschild’s own writing there is simply no singularity at 
r  =  2m,  to  use  the  modern  notation,  and  so  the  argument  for  general  relativity 
predicting the existence of black holes cannot be justified by reference to the so-called 
Schwarzschild  solution  and  it  seems  not  a  little  ironic  that  non-rotating,  uncharged 
black holes should be called Schwarzschild black holes. 
 
Conclusions. 
  
    These days, claims for the identification of black holes appear fairly regularly in the 
scientific literature. Quite often, the supposed existence of black holes - even that of 
so-called  massive  black  holes  -  is  invoked  to  explain  some  otherwise  puzzling 
phenomenon. However, so far, on no occasion has the postulated object satisfied the 
requirement mentioned earlier that, for a black hole, the ratio of the body’s mass to its 
radius  -  or  more  specifically  in  general  relativistic  language,  the  radius  of  its  event 
horizon - must be subject to the restriction

[8]. Now it emerges that the mathematical singularity at the centre of the discussion 
simply  did  not  appear  in  Schwarzschild’s    original  solution  of  Einstein’s  equations. 
Obviously  mathematics  was  used  by  Schwarzschild  to  find  this  solution,  but  it  was 
used  meticulously.  It  was  noted  carefully that, if a transformation of coordinates for 
which  the  determinant  of  the  transformation  does  not  equal  unity,  is  used,  then  the 
field  equations  themselves  would  not  remain  in  an  unaltered  form.  Hence, 
Schwarzschild  adopted  a  transformation  for which the value of the said determinant 
was one and went on to derive an exact, - not approximate, - solution to the equations. 
Also, Einstein himself proved that the singularity appearing in the popular form of the 
Schwarzschild  solution  has  no  physical  significance.  In  all  that  Schwarzschild  and 
Einstein did on this topic, the mathematics was a tool to help them achieve what they 
wanted.  At  no  point  was  physical  reality  modified  to  fit  a  mathematical  conclusion. 
This  is  the  way  things  should  be  and  provides  an  object  lesson  to  many;  -  the 
mathematics is a tool and, as such, must be subservient to the physics. 
 
    Where then does that leave the modern notion of a black hole? Considerations such 
as  those  above,  undoubtedly  raise  major  questions  about  the  basis  of  much  modern 
work.  The  idea  of  a  body  being  so  dense  that  it’s  escape  speed  is  greater  than  the 
speed of light remains not unreasonable though but, if the speed of light is a variable 
quantity - proportional, for example, to the square root of the background temperature, 
as suggested by Thornhill [9], Moffatt [10] and, more recently, Albrecht and Magueijo 
[11] - many new and interesting questions arise.

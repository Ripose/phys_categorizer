1. INTRODUCTION
The problem of forced  convection along an isothermal  moving   plate is a classical 
problem  of  fluid  mechanics  that  has  been  solved  for  the  first  time  in  1961  by 
Sakiadis (1961). It appears that the first work concerning mixed  convection along a 
moving  plate  is  that  of  Moutsoglou  and  Chen  (1980).  Thereafter,  many  solutions 
have been obtained for different aspects of this class of boundary layer problems.  In 
the previous  works the fluid properties have been assumed constant. Ali  (2006) in a 
recent paper treated, for the first time, the mixed  convection problem with variable 
viscosity.  He  used  the  local  similarity  method  to  solve  this  problem  but  there  are 
doubts  about  the  validity  of  his  results.  For  that  reason  we  resolved  the  above 
problem  with the direct numerical solution of the boundary layer equations without 
any transformation.     
    

2. THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL
Consider  the flow along a  vertical flat  plate  with u and v denoting respectively the 
velocity  components  in  the  x  and  y  direction,  where  x  is  the  coordinate  along  the 
plate and y is the coordinate perpendicular to x.  For steady, two-dimensional flow 
the boundary layer equations including variable viscosity  and buoyancy forces are

where  T  is  the  fluid  temperature,    μ    is  the  dynamic  viscosity,  α  is  the  thermal 
diffusivity,  and  ρa is the ambient fluid density. 
The following boundary conditions have been applied:

at   y = 0       u=Uw, v=0, T=Tw                                                                                 (4)           
as  y →        u =0 ,T = Ta                                                          (5)

where Tw  is the plate  temperature,  Ta   is the ambient fluid temperature and Uw is the 
constant velocity of the moving plate. 
    The viscosity is assumed to be an inverse linear function of temperature  given by 
the following equation  (Ali 2006)

                                                                                                    (6)

where   μa is the ambient fluid dynamic viscosity and γ is a thermal property of the 
fluid.  
    The equations (1)-(3) represent a two-dimensional parabolic flow. Such a flow has 
a  predominant velocity in  the  streamwise coordinate  (unidirectional flow) which in 
our case is the direction along the plate. The equations were solved directly, without 
any  transformation,  using  the  finite  difference    method  of  Patankar  (1980).      The 
solution  procedure  starts  with  a  known  distribution  of  velocity  and  temperature    at 
the  plate  edge  (x=0)  and  marches  along  the  plate.  At  the  leading  edge    the 
temperature was taken uniform and equal to ambient one and the velocity was also 
uniform  with  a  very  small  value.  At  each  downstream  position  the  discretized 
equations  (2)  and  (3)  are  solved  using  the  tridiagonal  matrix  algorithm  (TDMA).  
The  cross-stream  velocities  v  were  obtained  from  the  continuity  equation.  The 
forward step size Δx was 0.001 mm and we used a nonuniform lateral grid with 500 
points  where  Δy  increases along y.  In the numerical solution of the boundary layer 
problems  the  calculation  domain  must  always  be  at  least  equal  or  wider  than  the 
boundary  layer  thickness.  However,  it  is  known  that  the  boundary  layer  thickness 
increases with x.  Therefore, it would be desirable to have a grid which conforms to 
the actual shape of the boundary layer. For that reason  an expanding grid has been 
used  in the present  work.  The results  are   grid independent. The  parabolic solution 
procedure  is  a  well known  solution  method and    has  been  used  extensively    in  the 
literature.  It appeared for the first time in 1970 (Patankar and Spalding , 1970)   and  
has  been included  in classical fluid  mechanics  textbooks (see page  275  in      White, 
1991).  Anderson et  al.  (1984)  mention 7  numerical  methods for the  solution of  the 
boundary layer equations (page 364) and among them is the “well known Patankar–
Spalding method”. The method is fully implicit and  can be applied to both similar 

and nonsimilar problems.   The dynamic viscosity μ and the  Prandtl number, which 
is  a  function  of  viscosity,  have    been  considered  variable  during  the  solution 
procedure.  A  detailed  description  of  the  solution  procedure,  with  variable 
thermophysical properties,  may be found in Pantokratoras (2002).                          

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The  local  Nusselt  number  and  the  local  Reynolds  number  have    been  defined  as 
follows by Ali (2006)

It  should be  mentioned  here  that  when θr  →  the  fluid viscosity becomes  equal  to 
ambient  viscosity.  In  equations  (13)  and  (14)  the  prime  represents  differentiation 
with respect to similarity variable η  defined as (Ali, 2006)

Ali  (2006)  solved  equations  (13)  and  (14)    using  the  fourth  order  Runge-Kutta 
method. Locally similarity solutions were obtained for increasing values of λ at each 
constant  θr.  At  each  new  θr  the  procedure  starts  from  a  known  solution  which 
corresponds  to  pure  forced  convection  (λ=0).    The  Prandtl  number  included  in  the  
transformed  energy  equation  (15)  was  assumed  constant  and  equal  to  ambient  
Prandtl number

However, the Prandtl number is a function of viscosity and as viscosity varies across 
the  boundary layer, the Prandtl number varies, too.

    In table 1  the skin friction coefficient  CfRex
0.5    are given for ambient Prandtl number 0.72. In this table the results by Ali (2006)  

have been also included for comparison. The results by Ali have been taken from his 
figures  4  and  8.  It   was  difficult  to  extract values    for  θr  near 0  and  1  and  for  that 
reason we took values for -10 θr -1.0 and  1.5θr  10. In the last column of the  
table  the Prandtl  numbers at the plate (Prw) are included.

0.5   and  the  Nusselt 
From  table  1  it  is  seen  that  the  skin  friction  coefficient  CfRex
–0.5   calculated by  the present method are in very good agreement 
number  NuxRex
with  those  calculated by  Ali  (2006)  and  Moutsoglou  and  Chen  (1980)  for  the  case 
λ=0 (pure forced convection) and constant viscosity. Except that the above quantities 
calculated by the present method are in very good agreement with those calculated by 
Moutsoglou and Chen (1980) for the cases λ=1, 5   (mixed convection) and constant 
viscosity. Our  results compare    also  very  well  with  those  of  Chen  (2000)  for  λ=10 
and constant viscosity. In addition our method has been used recently successfully  to 
two similar problems (Pantokratoras, 2004, 2005). The Nusselt numbers given by Ali 

0.5

(2006) are in good agreement with our results for all cases of the buoyancy parameter 
λ.      For  the  skin  friction  coefficient  CfRex
things  are  different.  For  λ=0  there  is 
very good agreement but for λ=1 large differences appear. The divergence exist also 
0.5  values are always 
for  higher values of λ  at a smaller rate.  It is seen that our CfRex
lower  than  those  of  Ali  (2006)  and  this  is  in  accordance  with  the  velocity  profiles 
included in figures 1 and 2 where we see that  the velocity  profiles calculated by the 
present method  lay lower than those of Ali. It is advocated here that the results of the 
skin friction coefficient given by Ali (2006) for λ1  are wrong. The error  is caused 
probably  by  the  local  similarity  method  that  has  been  used  for  the  solution  of  the 
equations.  Minkowycz and Sparrow (1974) mention that an unorthodox version of 
the  local  similarity  method  yields  results  of  uncertain  accuracy.  It  should  be  noted 
here  that  Ali  (2006)  tested  the  accuracy  of  his  method  comparing  the  results  only
with  those  of  the  pure  forced  convection  case  (λ=0).  If  the  comparison  had  been 
extended to existing results for the mixed convection problem with constant viscosity 
(Moutsoglou and Chen, 1980, Chen, 2000) the error would appear.

1 INTRODUCTION 
An old idea of colliding of the electron beam from linac 
with  a  beam  stored  in  a  ring  [1]  is  widely  discussed 
during the last decade with two purposes: 

 

• 

• 

to achive the TeV energy scale in lepton-hadron and 
photon-hadron collisions (see review articles [2] and 
references therein), 
luminosity  particle  factories, 
to  construct  high 
namely  ,  B-factory  [3],  φ-factory,  [4,5]  c−τ-factory 
[6] etc.  

 
Concerning the first direction, TESLA⊗HERA based ep, 
γp,  eA  and  γA  colliders  are  included  in  TESLA  project 
[7]. And, Linac⊗LHC based ep, γp, eA, FELγA colliders 
[8] can be considered as the next step. On the other hand, 
linac-ring  type  B-factory  has  lost  its  attractiveness  with 
KEK-B  [9]  and  PEP-B  [10]  colliders  coming  into 
operation. 
    In  this  paper,  we  show  that  linac-ring  type  particle 
factories still are the matter of interest considering charm 
and  tau  options.  In  section  2,  we  present  general 
investigation of beam dynamics aspects of linac-ring type 
colliders.  Proposed  parameters  of  linac-ring  type  charm 
and  tau  factories  are  discussed  in  section  3.1  and  3.2, 

 

respectively.  In 
concluding remarks.  

the  final  section,  we  give  some 

2 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
From  the  point  of  view  of  particle  physics,  there  are 
two  most  important  collider  parameters:  center  of  mass 
energy  and  luminosity.  For  ultra-relativistic  colliding 
beams, center of mass energy is given by 

s =

.                            (1) 
In our case, E1 is the energy of electrons accelerated in the 
linac and E2 is the energy of positrons stored in the ring. 
For charm factories, it is important to have

   Another  restrictive  condition  which  limits  number  of 
particles  in  a  positron  bunch  is  microwave  instability.  
The  microwave  instability  for    |Z /n|  ~1  Ω    consistent 
with  SSRF,  limits  the  number  of  positrons  per  bunch  to 
∼
  for  tau 
factory. The transverse mode coupling instability limits of 
the  positrons  bunch  population  is  higher  than  the 
microwave  instability  limit.  Therefore  it  can  be  ignored. 
Scaled  from  SSRF  proposal  bunch  lengthening  due  to 
potential  well  distortion  is  less  than  10%.  As  a  result, 
number  of  positrons  per  bunch  in  our  parameter  sets  are 
below of limits of these instabilities.

   One can see that linac-ring type τ-factory will produce 
7104 ⋅≈
 pair per working year, which exceeds by 
one order the statistics obtained at LEP and CLEO up to 
now. 
   Until this point, we have assumed that lower limit on β∗ 
in  both  parameter  sets  is  given  by  the  positron  beam 
bunch  length  (Hourglass  effect).  This  limitation  can  be 
relaxed by applying a (cid:147)dynamic (cid:148) focusing scheme, where 
the positron beam waist travels with the e- bunch during 
collision [15]. This scheme requires a pair of pulsed RF-
quadropoles  to  be  installed  on  both  side  of  interaction 
region. In this way, the limitation on β∗ becomes equal to 
electron bunch length. This corresponds to upgrade of the 
luminosities on Table I by factor 4.5.

We have shown that linac-ring type machines will give an 
3310
cm-2s-1, which essentially 
opportunity to achieve 
exceeds  the  luminosity  values  of  existing  and  proposed 
standard  (ring-ring  type)  charm  and  tau  factories.  This 
leads  to  an  obvious  advantage  in  search  for  rare  decays. 
Another  important  feature  of  linac-ring  type  charm 
factory  is  the  asymmetric  kinematics.  This  will  be 
important in investigation of oscillations and CP-violation 
in strange and charm sector of the SM.

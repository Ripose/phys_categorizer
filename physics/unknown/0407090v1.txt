Abstract 

  The induced atomic movement at melting has to overcome on a viscous drag resistance.  It is 

suggested that the latent heat of fusion supplies the required energy for this physical process.  The 

introduced viscosity model allows calculating the latent heat from the viscosity, the molar volume, 

the melting temperature, and the atomic mass and diameter.  The correlation between these 

parameters and the latent heat was calculated for monoatomic melts formed from body and face 

centered cubic structure.  The correlation coefficients are 0.97 and 0.99. 

 

1. Introduction 

  Besides the enormous importance of the liquid-solid phase transformation there 

is still no satisfactory theory able to describe this physical process.  One of the 

missing key elements is the understanding of the latent heat of fusion 

]L[
f

.  The 

latent heat of fusion is the energy which has to be supplied to the system in order to 

complete the phase transformation.  This energy is absorbed at constant 

temperature when the solid transforms to liquid.  Since the temperature remains 

constant the corresponding entropy change is the difference between the entropy 

[S] of the two phases.

where  mT is the melting temperature in Kelvin.  The melting or solidification of a 

crystalline solid is always a first order transition and heat absorbed or released at 

the melting temperature (Fig. 1a).  There is only one exception to this general rule 

[1;2] the transition of solid helium to liquid helium II (Fig. 1b).  Not every solid 

liquid phase transformation requires latent heat for their transition [3;4].  Non-

crystalline solids or glasses do not have a well defined melting temperature and 

latent heat is not required for the completion of their phase transformation (Fig. 1c).  

The questions, what is the physical process behind the latent heat and how the 

different transformation of crystalline, non-crystalline solids, and helium can be 

explained, will be considered in details. 

 

 

2. Proposed model 

Investigating the fundamental characteristics of the solid and liquid phases, one of 

the most striking differences between them is the atomic position stability.  In 

solids the atomic positions are well defined while in liquids the position stability is 

lost.  The induced atomic movement at melting most likely will generate viscous 

resistance.  It is suggested that the energy of the latent heat of fusion is utilized to 

overcome on this viscous resistance.  This physical explanation of the latent heat is 

consistent with the zero viscosity of helium II and with the glass transformation.  If 

the latent heat supplies the energy for the viscous drag then liquid with zero 

viscosity should not require latent heat for its phase transformation.  The transition 

between solid and liquid helium II requires no energy (Fig. 1b). 

When non-crystalline solids solidify the atomic movements are not sized but 

reduced.  This continuous reduction of the atomic movements should spread the 

released energy through the whole temperature range of the phase transformation.  

The lack of definite melting point and latent heat for non-crystalline solids (Fig. 1c) 

is consistent with the proposed physical explanation. 

The thermal velocity of the atoms in liquid is

  Equation 10 has been tested using experimental data of liquids formed from the 

same crystal structure.  The physical properties of the 17 elements, used for the 

investigation, are listed in Table 1.  The variables correlate well with the latent heat 

of fusion as predicted by equation 10 (Fig. 2a-d).  The calculated correlation 

coefficients between all the variables and the latent heat are 0.97 and 0.99 for 

liquids formed from body centered cubic (bcc) and from face centered cubic (fcc) 

structure respectively.

  The average values are 1.93 (28), 1.29 (54), and 1.57 (18) for liquids formed 

from bcc, fcc, and hexagonal closed packing structure respectively.  The errors are 

equivalent with the standard deviations.  The calculated 1-2 coupled atoms for the 

different melts seem to be reasonable. 

  

4. Conclusions 

 

It has been proposed that the energy of the latent heat of fusion is required to 

overcome on the viscous drag resistance introduced at melting.  Assuming that the 

atoms are moving with their thermal velocity in the liquid the viscous resistance 

working against this movement was calculated for melts formed from highly 

symmetrical packing arrangements.  The calculated energies correlate well to the 

experimentally determined latent heat values.

Abstract: In this paper, we study topological patterns of urban street networks using a largest sample 
(the largest so far to the best of our knowledge) of 40 U.S. cities and a few more from elsewhere of 
different  sizes.  It  is  found  that  all  the  topologies  of  urban  street  networks  based  on  street-street 
intersection demonstrate a small world structure, and a scale-free property for both street length and 
connectivity  degree.  That is,  about  80%  streets  of  any  network have  length or degrees  less  than  the 
average value of the network, while 20% streets have length or degrees greater than the average. Out 
of the 20%, there are less than 1% streets which can form a backbone of the street network. Based on 
the  finding,  we  conjecture  that  20%  streets  account  for  80%  traffic  flows,  and  less  than  1%  streets 
constitute a cognitive map of an urban street network. We illustrate further some peculiarities about 
the scale-free property.

1. Introduction 
In the last decade, topological analysis has been widely adopted to uncover patterns or structures from various 
real world systems including information, social, technology and biological. This new wave of interest revival is 
mainly triggered by the discovery of small world and scale free networks [1, 2] and the increasingly availability 
of the various real world network datasets like the Internet and World Wide Web. The emergence of geographic 
information systems (GIS) has generated an increasing amount of geospatial data about urban street networks. 
An urban street network is often perceived as a primal graph whose vertices represent street segments and edges 
represent  segment  intersections  (or  junctions).  This  network  is  a  traditional  representation  for  transportation 
modeling [3], but it is not good one for uncovering structures or patterns. Such a network on the surface has a 
pretty simple structure. To uncover a structure or pattern from the network representation is like to perceive an 
image in terms of pixels rather than things or objects, i.e., the street segments to a network are the pixels to an 
image. To perceive a street network, we need to merge individual segments into meaningful streets, just as we 
merge individual pixels as meaningful objects.   
 
Two different approaches for merging individual street segments into meaningful streets have been adopted in 
the literature. The first is based on the same street name to merge individual street segments, and this is the so 
called named streets approach [4]. The second relies on a good continuation to merge adjacent street segments 
together  to  form  meaningful  streets.  The  streets  are  also  called  strokes  [5]  based  on  perceptual  grouping,  a 
fundamental concept of Gestalt psychology [6], which has wide applications in human and computer vision for 
pattern  recognition  [7].  Based  on  the  streets,  a  dual  graph  can  be  formed  by  taking  the  streets  as  vertices  and 
street intersections as edges of the graph for topological analysis. However, the two approaches have their pros 
and cons. The first approach must rely on very accurate information about street names for the merging process, 
a semantic approach in essence. Unfortunately, even most comprehensive databases cannot guarantee that every 
street  segment  has  a  valid  name,  not  to  say  incorrect  names  are  attached  to  wrong  street  segments.  This 
incomplete or inaccurate nature of database is a big impediment to adopt the approach. In this respect, the second 
approach shows a complementary advantage, since valid names are not necessary for the merging process.   
 
In  this paper, we  adopt  the  second  approach  to  form  streets  and  then  check  street-street  intersection  to  form a 
topology of an urban street networks for analysis. We apply the topological analysis to a very large sample of 
U.S.  cities  as  well  as  a  few  more  from  elsewhere  in  order  to  illustrate  both  universality  and  peculiarity  about 
topological  patterns  of  urban  street  networks.  In  this  connection,  primary  studies  have  been  done  by  some 
researchers.  For  instance,  based  on  the  named  street  approach,  Jiang  [8]  re-examined  scale-free  property  of 
degree distribution, and confirmed a power law distribution that revised their initial conclusion [4]. Both [9] and 
[10]  have  studied  some  city  samples,  and  pointed  out  a  general  tendency  of  power  law  distributions,  but  no 
particular  form  which  power  law  distribution  might  take.  Criticisms  have  been  around  the  studied  samples  in 
drawing  a  reliable  conclusion  because  of  using  the  one-square  mile  areas  [11].  The  street  networks  from  the 

 

1

studied samples seem incomplete. For example, the city Los Angeles contains only 240 streets, but it has 57752 
streets according to our sample (see Table 1 late in this paper). Carvalho and Penn [12] have also illustrated the 
power law distributions of open space linear segments derived from a very big city sample. The similar scaling 
property has also been found for nationwide road networks [13]. This paper is intended to have in-depth study on 
the street-street intersection topology based on a largest city sample extracted from the Topologically Integrated 
Geographic  Encoding  and  Referencing  (TIGER)  database  developed  by  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau.  We  will 
illustrate  an  emergent  pattern  in  terms  of  street-street  intersection  topology.  That  is,  about  80%  streets  of  any 
network have a length or degrees less than the average of the network, while 20% streets have length or degrees 
greater than the average. Out of the 20%, there are less than 1% streets which can form a backbone of the street 
network. We will demonstrate how this illustrated topological pattern is universal for different cities, even for 
different  parts  of  a  city  (with  a  reasonable  size).  Apart  from  the  universality,  we  will  also  illustrate  some 
peculiarity  on  the  scaling  property,  e.g.,  some  street-street  intersection  topologies  have  two  (or  even  more) 
exponents. 
 
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section two, we introduce briefly the TIGER database, a 
reliable  database  for  topological  analysis,  and  describe  in  detail  how  the  datasets  of  urban  street  networks  are 
pre-processed  for  extracting  street-street  intersection  topologies.  In  section  three,  we  compute  and  analyze 
topological  measures  for  the  large  city  sample,  and  illustrate  some  universal  and  peculiar  patterns  about 
topologies  of  urban  street  networks.  Finally  in  section  four,  we  point  out  that  the  findings  have  far  reaching 
implications towards the understanding of cognitive maps and self-organizing cities.   
 
 
2. Main data source and data processing based on perceptual grouping 
The main data source used in the study is the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing 
(TIGER) database, developed by the U.S. Census Bureau in the 1970s of last century. It is mainly based on the 
theories  of  topology  and  graph  theory  for  encoding  the  location  of  geographic  objects  such  as  streets,  rivers, 
railroads  and  other  features  and  their  relationships.  The  topological  structure  of  the  TIGER  ensures  no 
duplication of these geographic features or areas, thus a very economic data organization. Urban street networks 
are  stored  as  the format  of Digital  Line  Graphs,  which  is  topologically  structured.  The  networks database  is  a 
well maintained and updated, so it is a reliable database for the kind of topological analysis. Taking Los Angeles 
for example, it contains 93 isolated street segments out of 225346 total street segments, less than 0.04%. On the 
other  hand,  it  contains  7699  segments  (over  3%)  that  have  no  appropriate  street  names.  These  segments  with 
missing names appear to be with road junctions, thus deleting them would significantly distort the topological 
patterns.  For  this  reason,  we  believe  that  the  stroke-based  approach  tend  to  be  more  robust  model  for  the 
analysis.   
 
We  selected  40  cities  (or  urban  areas  in  more  general)  ranked  between  the  first  and  160th  according  to 
population. The 40 cities were deliberately chosen from the database for the study. We first choose top 10 cities, 
and second 10 cities between 91st and 100th, and then another ten in the middle of top 100, ranging from 56th to 
65th. After extensive study and exploration, another 10 smaller cities were chosen from range 151-160. Therefore 
the city sample represents a diverse set in terms of both size and their geographic locations. The dataset can be 
downloaded  from  the  U.S.  Census  Bureau  website  [14].  For  convenience,  we  downloaded  it  from  the  ESRI 
ArcData site [15], which has a friendly interface. The main advantage of using the data is that we can take an 
entire urban street network rather than a partial one for analysis. To ensure street networks that are truly in an 
urban area, we used urban area boundary data layer of 2000 to crop the street networks. The two layers (i.e., line 
features – roads, and urban areas 2000) are overlapped to crop the street networks within individual urban areas. 
This  guarantees  that  the  datasets  are  truly  urban  street  networks.  The  cropped  urban  street  networks  have 
naturally  evolved  boundaries,  and  some  of  them  have  very  funny  animal-like  shapes  (see  Figure  1  for  an 
example). To this point, the reader may have understood that the street networks are not necessary to be within 
cities but within urban areas.   
 
The  cropped  urban  street  networks  were  then  pre-processed  in  order  to  form  individual  streets  based  on  the 
gestalt  principle  of  good  continuation.  Good  continuation  refers  to  an  innate  tendency  to  perceive  a  line 
continuing  its  established  direction.  By  checking  deflection  angle  from  one  segment  to  another,  it  will  help 
determine  whether  or  not  two  adjacent  line  segments  are  perceived  as  a  street.  A  perfect  continuation  implies 
that the deflection angle between one street segment and its adjacent one is zero. However, the condition can be 
relaxed dramatically. We choose degree 70 as a threshold for determining continuity in the study. This is based 
on  our  observation  that  this  degree  threshold  is  likely  to  detect  ring  roads  or  semi-ring  roads  which  are  often 
appeared  in  cities.  The  grouping  process  takes  an  ordinary  street  segments-based  shape  file  as  input,  and 
generates a shape file that is streets-based. The process can be described as follows. For every street segment, we 

 

2

trace its connected segments, and concatenate the segment and an adjacent one with the smallest deflection angle. 
Note this process should be done at both ends of every street segment.   
 
Next  we  want  to  make  sure  that  all  streets  are  interconnected,  and  no  isolated  streets  in  other  words.  For  the 
purpose, we select one street as a root, and adopt the well-known Breadth-First Search algorithm [16] to explore 
all those streets that directly or indirectly connected to the root street. Clearly those that are not connected either 
directly or indirectly to the root street are the isolated ones, which should be deleted. It should be noted that the 
percentage of isolated streets tend to be very small portion as mentioned above.

3. Topological Analysis 
After the above grouping and cleaning process, all isolated street or streets are deleted for the following process. 
We  compare  every  street  to  every  other  street,  to  see  if  they  are  intersected,  in  order  to  form  a  topology,  or 
connected graph. In general, a graph (G) consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) 
(where 
the number of nodes is n) and a finite set of edges (or links) E, which is a subset of the Cartesian product 
VV × . The connected graph can be represented as a matrix R(G), whose element rij is 1 if intersected, and 0 if 
non-intersected. Formally it is represented as follows:

, and that all diagonal elements of 

R(G) are equal to zero. From a computational point of view, for each street we compare only those street within 
a same envelop, a rectangular area that covers a street.   
 
Before illustrate in detail the result of topological analysis, let’s first briefly introduce three topological measures, 
namely  degree,  path  length  and  clustering  coefficient.  For  a  vertex,  its  degree  is  the  number  of  other  vertices 
directly connected to it. The average of degree of all individual nodes is that of the graph. Formally it is defined

Path  length  of  a  graph  is  to  measure  how  compact  a  graph  is.  For  a  graph  with  5  vertices,  if  every  vertex  is 
connected to every other, then it is very compact, thus a smallest path length. On the other hand, the 5 vertices 
are connected a sort of chain, then it is organized in a very loose way, thus a largest path length. Formally path 
length is defined as

Clustering  coefficient  is  to  measure  the  clustering  level  of  a  graph.  It  can  be  seen  from  how  clustered  each 
individual vertex is, which can be defined as a ratio of actual edges to possible edges. The average of clustering 
coefficient of individual vertices is that of their graph, i.e.,

We first compute the measures for the topologies of the 40 urban street networks, and the result is presented in 
Table 1. We found that the topologies show a small world structure, with path length pretty close to that of their 
random counterparts. This result is significantly deviated from what has been illustrated by previous studies [9, 
10], where path length tend to be far greater than their random counterparts. The reason we suspect is due to the 
facts  that  the  two  studies  used  one-square  mile  area  or  part  of  a  city  in  their  city  samples,  and  their  street 
networks  are  derived  from  scanned  binary  images  [17].  We  further  examined  the  distributions  of  degree  and 
~)(
xp
found they all exhibit power law distributions, i.e., 
. Figure 2 demonstrates log-log plots, whose 
x-axis and y-axis represent the logarithms of degree and cumulative probability. We can remark that most of the 
log-log curves are pretty close to a straight line with an exponent around 2.0, thus a clear indication of power 
laws. The exponent for each log-log curves is computed according to a formula suggested by [18].

The power law distributions indicate that most streets have a very low degree, while a few have an extremely 
high degree. Because degree and path length are significantly correlated, i.e., lengthy streets tend to have more 
other  streets  intersected,  the  power  law  is  applicable  to  street  length  as  well.  This  scaling  property  for  both 
degree and street length can be illustrated even in a rather detailed way shown in Figure 3. In words, this pattern 
states that about 80% streets of any network have length or degrees less than the average of the network, while 
20% streets have length or degrees greater than the average. Out of the 20%, there are less than 1% streets which 
can form a backbone of the street network (Figure 4). In other words, all the streets are put around the average 
degree into two groups: those well connected (20%, with less than 1% are extremely well connected), and those 
less connected (80%). Interestingly the pattern seems universal to all the cities.

The above topological pattern appears to be universal and this has been reconfirmed by other 6 cities (Table 2). 
Among the cities, Duffield is the smallest U.S. city or town, and the pattern appears to be applicable to it as well. 
To further verify the above pattern, we select parts of a city with different sizes (Figure 5) for the topological 
analysis. To our surprise, the selected parts of an urban street network still demonstrate the universal pattern. We 
should remark that when the number of streets selected less than a couple of hundreds, the pattern may disappear. 
This  is  not surprising,  since  the  selected  streets  are  too  small  to  be  representative,  and  the kind  of  topological 
analysis is for large networks with hundreds or thousands of vertices in essence.

Having illustrated the universality, now let’s tend to peculiarity in terms of topological patterns. Taking example 
of New York, Manhattan’s grid-like structure is certainly different from its neighboring areas. This can be seen 
clearly  from  the  power  law  distributions  of  different  districts.  It  must  be  stressed  that  the  log-log  curve  for 
Manhattan is not a straight line overall, and it is deviated from other curves. This is the peculiarity that we intend 
to illustrate. The reader may have also noticed that the power law exponent has two different values for cities 
including Philadelphia, Laredo and San Francisco in the above tables. We use the example of San Francisco to 
illustrate the fact. For San Francisco, it contains in total 2717 streets. Among them, 96.6% streets have a degree 
less  than  33,  while  the  rest  of  streets  have  a  degree  greater  than  33.  Those  streets  having  a  degree  follow  the 
power  distribution  with  exponent  1.7,  while  those  streets  having  a  degree  greater  than  33  follow  the  power 
distribution with exponent 3.4. This is clearly illustrated in Figure 6.

The bipartite power law distributions imply that all the streets can be put into two parts, and each part follows a 
power  law  distribution  with  an  exponent.  The  reason  underlying  the  double  exponents  is  still  unclear,  but  we 
suspect  it  is  due  to  grid-like  street  networks  as  both  Manhattan  and  San  Francisco  have  very  similar  grid-like 
patterns. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper has  studied  street-street  intersection  topology using  a  largest data  sample  of  urban  street  networks. 
We  have  illustrated  that  the  topologies  of  urban  street  networks  are  far  from  random,  but  small  worlds  with 
scale-free property. The scale-free property can be further described in details as follows. About 80% streets of 
any network have length or degrees less than the average value of the network, while 20% streets have length or 
degrees greater than the average. Out of the 20%, there are less than 1% streets which can form a backbone of 
the street network. Thus, all the streets are put around the average degree into two (or three) imbalanced groups. 
Urban street networks on the surface have a pretty simple structure, but underneath or at the cognitive level is a 
consistent  recurrence  of  this  unbalanced  pattern.  This  scaling  pattern  provides  for  the  first  time  quantitative 
evidence as to why an image of the city [19] can be formed in our minds from the perspective of streets, i.e., the 
vital few tend to be landmarks in human cognitive maps.   
 
This inbuilt imbalance leads us to conjecture that 20% well connected streets account for 80% traffic flows, and 
less  than  1%  extremely  well  connected  streets  constitute  a  cognitive  map  of  an  urban  street  network.  If  the 
conjecture does hold true, we do not need to invest equally to all streets, but the 20% to get a maximum reward – 
least effort in Zipf’s term [20]. What “invisible hand” creates urban street networks which all follow the power 
law  distributions  seems  still  unclear  to  us,  but  the  illustrated  pattern  sheds  substantial  lights  on  the  notion  of 
self-organizing  cities  [21,  22].  We  tend  to  believe  that  the  universal  power  law  is  a  patent  signature  of 
self-organizing cities. In other words, cities are developed much in the same way as living organs like embryos.

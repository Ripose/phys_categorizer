Abstract 
 
In  this  contribution,  the  structural  modifications  of  the  material  and  the  degradation  of 
devices  is  modelled  and  compared  with  experimental  data  for  more  resistivities, 
temperatures,  crystal  orientations  and  oxygen  concentrations,  considering  the  existence 
of  the  new  primary  fourfold  coordinated  defect,  besides  the  vacancy  and  the  interstitial. 
Some  estimations  of  the  behaviour  of  detectors  in  concrete  environments  at  the  next 
generations  of  high  energy  physics  experiments  as  LHC,  SLHC,  VLHC,  or  ULHC  are 
done.

Bulk displacement damage in silicon produces effects at the device level and limits their long 

time utilisation in detector systems. So, the modelling of the damage produced by the radiation 

fields in silicon and in silicon detectors, and the prediction of the time behaviour of detectors in 

different  hostile  environments,  represents  a  useful  tool  which  will  permit  taking  the  best 

decisions for obtaining radiation harder materials. 

In  the  present  contribution,  starting  from  the  interaction  of  the  incoming  particle  with  the 

lattice [1], with the formation of primary defects, where the existence and characteristics of new 

SiFFCD defect is considered [2, 3], the kinetics of defects is treated in the frame of a model based

on the theory of diffusion limited reactions, developed previously by the authors [4]. The effects 

on device parameters are investigated.  

The  time  dependence  of  the  degradation  of  different  silicon  materials  which  differ  by 

resistivity, crystal orientation, oxygen concentration and temperature of irradiation and operation 

after  proton  irradiation  is  obtained  and  presented  in  Figures  1  and  2.  The  predictions  of  the 

model  are  compared  with  experimental  available  data  [5,  6],  regarding  the  modifications 

produced: increase of leakage current and change of effective carrier concentration.

The anisotropy of the effective threshold energy in silicon at irradiation after different crystal 

directions is clearly observed in FZ materials and is ambiguous in DOFZ and this behaviour is 

tentatively attributed to the deformation of lattice due to the increase of oxygen concentration. 

The theoretical predictions of threshold energies in silicon are controversial – see the review in 

Ref. [7], in conditions of lack of systematic experimental studies.

The model reproduces well or reasonably well the time behaviour of detectors with different 

resistivities and oxygen contents between 20  0C and -20  0C after proton irradiation at fluences 

The long time behaviour of silicon detectors in some ultra high energy radiation environments 

is predicted. Scenarios for the next SLHC, VLHC, ULHC colliders are considered in agreement 

with the hypothesis mentioned in Ref. [8].

An interesting model prediction is that the leakage current scales with the rate of generation 

of primary defects and is roughly independent on particle spectra and material technology (FZ 

or DOFZ), and the rate of increase of the current is about 5x10-12 Asec/pair/year at 20  0C and 

8x10-13 Asec/pair/year at 0 0C – see Figure 3.  

In Figure 4, the time variation of Neff at 0 0C suggests that DOFZ silicon is radiation harder in 

respect to FZ.

In  the  hypothesis  considered,  the  model  is  able  to  explain  and  predict  the  main 

characteristics of the degradation of detectors starting from microscopic phenomena.

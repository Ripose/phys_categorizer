In  this  paper  we  derive  an  equation  of  state  for  liquid  cesium  based  on  a  suggested 

potential function in accord to the characteristics large attraction and soft repulsion at 

the  asymptotes  of  interaction  potentials.  By  considering  the  interaction  of  nearest 

adjacent atoms in dense fluid, the equation of state predicts that the isotherm 

2V)1Z( −

 

is linear function of 

/1( ρ

)

, where 

Z

 is the compression factor, 

V

is the molar volume, 

and 

ρ

  is  the  molar  density.  The  linear  parameters  are  identified  as  interaction 

coefficients related to attraction and repulsion, and are used to evaluate the molecular 

parameters  with  interesting  implications.  The  isotherm  is  intended  to  resolve  the 

particular thermodynamic properties of alkali metals, which have been known for their 

unusual  change  of  the  nature  of  intermolecular  force  as  the  characteristic  metal-

nonmetal transition range is approached. When applied to liquid cesium, the isotherms 

persist  linear  over  the  whole  liquid  range  including  the  metal  non-metals  transition 

range  and  at  the  critical  temperature  perfectly.  The  isotherm  is  equivalent  to  a  virial 

(like)  EOS  for  which  the  linear  parameters  of  the  isotherm  form  the  corresponding 

second  and  third  virial  coefficients.  The  new  potential  function  turns  out  to  be  an 

effective  potential  that  includes  not  only  a  pair  interaction  but  also  many-body 

interactions and therefore it is not always comparable with pair potential.

1.  Introduction 

The  electronic  structure  of  liquid  metals  at  low  temperatures  can  be  well  approximated  by  the 

structure  of  the  solid  metals,  and  the  interaction  between  atoms  and  thus  the  thermodynamic 

properties  of  metals  are  obtainable  by  the  same  cohesion  mechanism  of  the  solid  metals.  The 

structure  of  a  solid  metal  is  usually  considered  as  a  collection  of  ions  fixed  at  the  solid  matrix 

imposed  by  the  solid  structure,  and  the  valance  electrons  delocalized  over  the  whole  lattice 

having  little  correlations  with  core  electrons.  At  ordinary  liquid  density  near  triple  point,  the 

effective  interaction  potential  of  alkali  metals  can  be  obtained  by  pseudopotential  perturbation 

theory  based  on  nearly  free  electron  model.  This  effective  procedure  considers  the  nuclei 

completely shielded by core electrons and partially by delocalized valence electrons. Near critical 

point,  however,  the  cohesion  mechanism  of  these  metals  will  be  suppressed  by  a  (partial) 

localization of electrons and the metallic character is gradually changed to a nonmetallic kind. In 

the gas phase, on the other hand, the metal vapor is composed of mainly neutral atoms plus ions 

and  molecules  comprising  clusters  of  different  size.  The  interaction  between  these  atom  and 

clusters can be modeled to a great deal by Lennard-Jones potential function. But, near the critical 

point especially in the metal-nonmetal transition region, there is no reliable theoretical method to 

derive  effective  potential  function  for  liquids  accurately.  Indeed,  the  effective  pair  potential 

function  for  liquid  at  high  densities  near  the  triple  point,  obtained  from  nearly  free  electron 

model, can reproduce the thermodynamic properties quite well, though, it gives less satisfactory 

results  in  the  expanded  liquid  metals  at  low  densities  (near  critical  point).  Under  such 

circumstance the accuracy of thermodynamic properties of liquid metals, predicted by theoretical 

studies, depends on the accuracy of pair potential function describing the interatomic interaction 

of these metals.  

 

The  electronic  structure  effectively  determines  the  interatomic  interaction  and  material 

structure as well, and therefore a unified understanding of the structure, the thermodynamics, and 

electronic properties of metal fluids, emanates a considerable scientific challenge. A great deal of 

effort  has  been  devoted  to  alkali  metals  to  study  the  marked  change  in  the  nature  of  forces,  as 
liquid metals are expanded.1,2,3 Close to critical temperature, the change in the nature of forces in 

liquid alkali is characterized by a sharp decrease in electrical conductivity. Structure factors and 

pair  correlation  functions  based  neutron  scattering  data  show  that  the  coordination  numbers  of 
these  metals  drop  linearly  with  temperature,2  and  accordingly,  the  nearest  adjacent  distance 

 

1

increases  steadily.  These  marked  properties  make  the  theoretical  studies  ambiguous  and  a 

meaningful  application of  pair potential for dense fluids need a pronounced justification. There 

has  been  an  open  field  to  describe  interaction  potentials  of  metals  by  conventional  models  and 

considering multipolar interactions, which are expressed as multipole expansion series to describe 
the attractive branch of the interaction potential as accurate as possible.4  

In  a  series  of  works,  the  Linear  Regularity  Isotherm  (LIR),5  which  originally  devised  for 
 
normal  fluids,  has  been  applied  to  the  alkali  metals.6,7  LIR  is  based  on  the  cell  theory  and 

considers  only  the  nearest  adjacent  interaction.  In  the  final  form  it  formulates  isotherms  of 

2V)1Z( −

, which are linear function of 

, where 

PZ
=

ρ

RT

 is the compression factor, 

V

is the 

2ρ

molar volume,  ρ  is the molar density, 

P

 is the pressure, and 

RT

 has its usual meaning. LIR is 

applied  well  to  the  most  Lennard-Jones  fluids  which  their  interaction  potential  can  be  modeled 

rather  accurately  by  the  (12-6)  powers  of  inverse  intermolecular  distance.  This  is  because  the 

nature  of  forces  of  Lennard-Jones  fluids  are  described  well  according  to  a  definite  dispersive 

interaction  mechanism.  However,  in  the  application  of  LIR  to  alkali  metals  liquids,  isotherms 

deviate  from  the  linear  behavior  as  the  critical  temperature  is  approached.  Of  course,  the 
6 suffers from 

application of LIR to alkali metals, as explored for the first time for liquid cesium,

metal-nonmetal transition as a consequence of the diversion of interatomic forces in the critical 

temperature  region.  A  conclusive  remark  was  that  the  assumption  of  the  nearest  adjacent 
interaction in the derivation of the LIR is break down.6,7 These observations have been attributed 

basically  to  onset  of  the  localization  and  partial  correlation  of  valence  electrons  as  the  critical 

temperature  is  approached,  which  lead  to  formation  of  metal-atoms  together  with  poly-atom 
clusters.7 Based on this objection, liquid alkali metals has been treated statistical mechanically as 
an  ensemble  of  mixture  of  metal-atoms  and  poly-atom  clusters,7  and  shown  that  LIR  leads  to 

isotherm 

2V)1Z( −

which is a quadratic function in 

. Although the composite specification of 

2ρ

the  mixture  was  not  specified  but,  by  this  modeling,  the  deviations  of  isotherms  from  a  linear 

behavior  (in  the  transition  region) have been attributed to the fractionation of the  atomic liquid 

metal system into molecular clusters. 

Following the explanation of the cause of transition, the linear exp-6 isotherm8,9 has derived 

by applying the exp-6 interaction potential function to model the long-range and the short-range 

interactions in the liquid alkali metals more realistically. Accordingly, isotherms of 

2V)1Z( −

 has

that adjusts asymptotes of both repulsion and attraction branches of the exp-6 potential function. 

By  application  of  exp-6  isotherm  to  liquid  cesium,  the  linear  feature  persists  well  beyond  the 

onset  of  the  metal-nonmetal  transition  region  at  which  the  transition  is  admitted.  [The  metal-

nonmetal  transition  has  been  identified  at  1450  K  by  LIR,  and  consistently  at

attributed to its well-estimation of the attraction potential energy,8 which is increased as a result 

of  increase  in  the  number  of  polarized  metal-atoms  (forming  clusters)  as  the  liquid  metal  is 

expanded. In fact, the large polarizablity of a metal-atom, in the low-density liquid, is due to the 

increase in correlation of the single valence electron with core electrons of the respective ion.   

The equilibrium interatomic distance  mr

 appears as a parameter in exp-6 isotherm. This plus 

the  fact  that  mr

  is  a  function  of  temperature  limits  the  applicability  of  the  exp-6  isotherm  for 

practical and theoretical purposes. 

In  this  paper,  we  explore  further  the  idea  that  the  cause  of  deviation  of  (LIR)  isotherms  in 

expanded  liquid  alkali  metals  in  the  transition  region  is  due  to  the  under-estimation  of  extra 

attractive  potential  due  to  development  of  polarized  metal-atoms  in  addition  to  ploy-atom 

clusters.  According  to  neutron  scattering  data  and  application  of  an  inversion  method  for 

interaction  potential  energy  in  liquid  cesium,  we  present  a  two-parameter  pair  (type)  potential 

function.  It is furnished to account suitably for the repulsion characteristics of alkali metals with 

soft electron clouds and the attraction characteristics of systems with appreciable coulombic long-

range  attraction.  The  equation  of  state,  derived  accordingly,  is  presented  as  a  linear  isotherm, 

which on rearrangement would be identical to a virial equation of state up to third virial, where 

the linear parameters of the isotherm are the interaction (virial) coefficients. The isotherm by this 

modeling  is  applied  to  liquid  cesium  for  which  PVT  data  are  available  over  the  whole  liquid 

range. The temperature dependence of parameters of the pair potential parameters are examined 

and its physical significant in relation to liquid structure will be presented.

For  a  large  number  of  atomic  and  molecular  fluids,  Lennard-Jones  (12-6)  potential  function 

accounts  for  the  pairwise  interaction  approximation  between  the  fluid  molecules  undergoing 

dispersive  interaction  as  the  major  interaction.  The  interest  in  Lennard-Jones  is  also  due  to  its 

simple  form,  which  facilitates  simple  integration  and  differentiation  desired  for  derivation  of 

analytical form of thermodynamic functions. However, in some typical dense fluid Lennard-Jones 

loss its application because it introduces unrealistic hard repulsion. Many fluids also interact with 

an  appreciable  coulombic  feature  so  much  the  long-range  dispersive  interaction  potential  is 

under-estimated if treated by only a simple sixth power of inverse of interatomic distance.  

 

In  spite  of  the  progress  in  understanding  of  the  electronic  properties  of  expanded  alkali 

metals,  essentially  not  very  much  is  known  on  the  strong  thermodynamic  state  dependence  of 

their  effective  interatomic  interaction  especially  the  change  in  these  interaction  as  the  metal-
nonmetal  transition  is  approached.10  The  recent  neutron  scattering  experiments  for  cesium  as  a 

function of temperature and pressure, however, directed to investigate the more detailed density 
dependence  of  the  effective  interaction  potentials  of  expanded  alkali  metals.10  This  requests  a 
theory  that  further  relates  the  structure  factor  to  the  interaction  potential.10,11  Results  of  the 

undertaken neutron scattering as a function of pressure have shown a change in the position of the 

first  peak  of  the  pair  correlation  function,  denoting  a  slight  change  in  the  mean  interatomic 

distance.  The  analysis  of  data  in  general  has  shown  that  at  high  densities  an  alkali  metal  atom 

interacts  with  a  repulsive  soft-core  at  small  interatomic  distances  and  with  a  weak  attraction  at 

intermediate interatomic distance. At larger atomic separation the potential function oscillates and 

takes

pair potential of liquid cesium for a wide range of density has been derived from the experimental 

4

structure  factors  using  the  inverse  method.11  The  derived  pair  potential  function  at  low 

temperatures  oscillates  at  large  interatomic  distances  but,  as  temperature  is  increased,  the 
oscillations  are  dumped  out.11  Also  as  the  temperature  is  increased  the  long-range  interaction 

would  be  characterized  by  a  more  attraction.    The  repulsive  side  of  this  potential  has  been 

analyzed  in  terms  of  an  inverse  power-law

approximation,  for  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  both  attraction  and  repulsion  potential  over  the 

whole  liquid  range  corresponding  to  the  intermediate  interatomic  distances.  This  is  of  major 

concern  in  this  work  to  investigation  the  detail  of  a  potential  function  suitable  for  liquid  alkali 

metals  (in  particular  liquid  cesium)  in  the  whole  liquid  range,  particularly  in  the  range  that  a 

liquid metal turns to the corresponding nonmetal.

3.  Linear Isotherm 

From  the  discussions  in  the  preceding  section,  we  believed  that  the  potential  function  Eq.  (3) 

could  suitably  describes  the  interaction  potential  between  pair  of  cesium  metal  atoms  in  dense 

liquid.  Thus,  we  apply  it  to  evaluate  the  interaction  potential  energy  of  atoms  in  the  liquid 

assuming  that  liquid  obey  the  following  model.  Close  to  freezing  temperature,  the  liquid  alkali 

metals have a body center cubic structure, closely similar to their corresponding solids structure. 

Therefore,  any  cesium  atom  has  8  nearest  adjacent  atoms,  and  by  assuming  the  pairwise 

additivity of the interaction potential the molecular parameters in Eq. (1) or (3) would be different 

from  the  molecular  parameters  of  an  isolated  pair.  In  this  model,  we  assume  the  complete 

pairwise  additivity  of  the  interaction  potential  between  any  atom  at  the  center  and  its  nearest 

adjacent atoms. Therefore, the total potential energy U of N-atom liquid is calculated as

Furthermore, we assume that any atom interact with its nearest adjacent atoms in pairs, like a pair

–  excluding  all  identical  interatomic

ε   is  binding  energy  of  atoms  1  and  2  in  the 

ensemble of N-2 other atoms, knowing that the most effective interaction are due to the nearest 

adjacent  atoms.  In  this  way,  insertion  of  Eq.  (3)  into  Eq.  (5)  for  liquid  metals  may  yield  ε   as 

binding  energy  of  an  atom  effectively  interacting  with  atoms  on  its  nearest  adjacent  shell  (and 

next shells as well). This concept of biding energy is well justified when the experimental PVT 

data is used to evaluate the molecular potential parameters. 

If  Eq.  (5)  can  be  evaluated  definitely,  e.g.,  using  an  accurate

4.  Results and Discussion  

4. A. Potential function and isotherm 

The approach of our model, which relates the 

electronic properties to thermodynamic properties, is the asymptotes of the interaction potential at 

short  and  long  ranges  determined  from  the  neutron  scattering  of  alkali  metals  plus  the 

corresponding theoretical calculations based on integral equation of state, in particular for liquid 
cesium.10,11  Most  theoretical  investigations  for  thermodynamic  properties  of  alkali  metals  are 

based  on  the  low-density  vapor,  which  dominantly  consist  of  isolated  atoms  with  bounded 

valance electrons (as well as small fractions of clusters with partially localized valence electrons). 

However, at high densities the valence electrons are dominantly delocalized and a giant molecule 
is  encountered.15  Treatment  of  the  later  is  complicated  but  the  nearly  free  electron  model  is 
applicable  quite  well.  In  this  regard,  the  well-established  pseudopotential  concept,16  which  has 

been devised to study solids, is applied well to study the liquid alkali metals over wide ranges of 

temperatures  and  densities.  A  number  of  investigations  have  shown  a  high  sensitivity  of  pair 
potential to the details of pseudopotential model.17 At the same time many atomic properties such 

as phonon spectra and elastic constants, which are usually calculated to estimate the accuracy of 
model, are less sensitive to the pseudopotential model used.17 Alkali metals are most popular in 

pseudopotential  theory,  and  the  method  appropriately  reproduces,  for  instant,  experimental 

structure factors of the metals calculated in the Percus-Yevick (PY) approximation. For the heavy 

alkali metals (e.g. Rb and Cs) at the thermodynamic states 

cT7.0T <

the pseudopotential method 

still work well but marked deviations are noticed at 

cT7.0T >

. These are not due to the failure of 

the PY approximation but because the pair potential becomes inappropriate at such low density.

17 

At high temperature lager deviations from experimental structure factor is noticed in the case of 

heavier  metals  like  liquid  Cs.  Although  these  methods  are  interesting  by  their  first  principle 

strength, their typical failure leave room for further studies of thermodynamic properties by the 

theories that uses semiempirical potential function.  

The  density  dependence  of  liquid-metal  potential  function  has  been  theoretically  concerned. 
.7,8,11,12  Complications  are  raised  when  one  is  concerned  with  calculations  of  state  properties  of 

liquid  metals  by  using  molecular  properties,  because  the  pairwise  additivity  is  simply  applied 

rather  accurately  only  to  the  respective  low-density  vapor  for  which  the  nature  of  molecular 

 

8

interaction remain constant as temperature is changed. The fact that the liquid alkali metals do not 

obey  the  law  of  corresponding  states  might  be  attributed  to  the  divers  changes  in  the  nature  of 

molecular  interaction  as  their  thermodynamic  states  are  changed.  Thus,  the  periodicity  of  the 

potential function at large r due to periodicity of lattice, regarded in the pseudopotential,  is  not 

valid at high temperature as it does at low temperatures. This observation is consistent with the 

potentials (at low and high T’s) derived by inversion of structure factors in reference 11.   

 

By the application of Eq. (3) [called 

)36( −

 potential function hereafter] and employment of 

thermodynamic  equation  of  state,  it  is  predicted  that  the  isotherms

conclude  the  thermodynamic  properties  of  liquid  cesium  because  the  high  density  limits,  i.e.,

oscillatory  part  in  the  potential  function  at  long  range,  which  has  been  concluded  from  the 
structure  factor  in  the  low  temperature  range.10,11  It  worth  noting  that  the  oscillation  is  the 

characteristic  of  the  potential  periodicity  of  the  liquid  lattice  and  is  furnished  by  the 

pseudopotential  model.  In  Fig.  3,

noticeable. We believe that the characteristic attraction of

for the persistent of the linear behavior of isotherms especially in the metal-nonmetal transition

  the  ratio

  for  liquid  cesium  is  within

  (i.e.,  one  order  of 

magnitude)  indicating  that  a  fair  balance  between  interatomic  attraction  and  repulsion  is 

responsible for smooth variation of potential well-depth  ε  with temperature  [see Fig. (4)]. It is 

noteworthy  to  mention  that 

ε

  does  not  depend  on  the  structure  and  the  density  as  can  be 

predicted  by  Eq.  (11).  However, 

σ

  depends  on  both  structure  of  the  unit  cell  (e.g.,  K)  and  the 

interaction coefficients  B  and 

C

. As the temperature is increased, we do not know precisely how 

does  the  structure  of  liquid  may  differ  from  low  temperature  body-center-cubic  structure,  and 

thus we have kept K constant over the whole liquid range. Not very surprisingly, as the attraction 

coefficient 

B

 is decreased 

 is increased in accord to Eq. (11). Except a small wiggling around 

1600 K, the variation of 

 with temperature is linear; a plot of which is shown in Fig. 5. This 

observation  is  in  accord  with  the  neutron  scattering  data  of  liquid  cesium  form  which  the  pair 
correlation function and thus the interatomic distance can be determined.2

 is determined to be 1589.5 K, for which the 
contribution  of  both  singlet  and  triplet  type  interactions  are  included.21  In  the  range

k/ε

  smoothly  decreases  with  temperature  and  almost  levels  off  from

on. This is a characteristic temperature, which we will refer to latter.   

Now  according  to  our  model,  taking  into  account  only  the  interaction  of  a  central  cesium 

atom with 8 nearest adjacent atoms, the value of  ε

 at the freezing temperature is estimated to

,  which  is  higher  by  about  7.6%  with  respect  to  spectroscopic  data.

21  The 

calculation  of  ε   by  our  method  depends  much  on  the  potential  model  used  to  establish  the 

relation  for  which  the  experimental  liquid  PVT  data  have  been  the  input  data.  This  method  for 

estimation of molecular parameters is simple and less costly than other methods, which somewhat 

depend of complicated experimental set up. 

The   

)36( −

  potential  is  an  effective  potential  that  includes  not  only  a  pair  interaction  but 

also many-body interactions and therefore it is not always comparable with a pair potential. 

4. D. Analogue potential functions  The  metal-nonmetal  transition  is  particularly  of 

interest  in  this  work.  To  show  the  range  of  linear  behavior  of  Eq.  (9),

  are  plotted  versus 

temperature in Fig. 6. It is seen that over the whole liquid range

in the transition range. Additionally, to see the effects of slopes of attraction and repulsion of a 

potential function on the linear behavior of the isotherms,

 are also plotted as a function n in 

Fig. 6, and as a function m in Fig. 7. For comparison, in both figures

According  to  choices  of  m  and  n,  Eq.  (12)  is  used  to  produce  Figs.  6  and  7  for  liquid  cesium. 

Notice that for m=6 and n=3, Eqs. (9) and (12) are identical except for the sign of the slope and 

do not have effects on the conclusions we are seeking for. Examination of Figs. 6 and 7 reveals 

that, with 

)36( −

potential function, linear isotherms persist over the whole liquid range including 

metal-nonmetal  transition  range,  which  onsets  at  the  temperature  1350  K,  and  at  the

deviates  from  the  linear  behavior  more  than

isotherm  over  the  whole  liquid  range.  In 

general,  in  the  transition  range  and  at  the  critical  temperature  larger  deviations  are  seen.  In  all 

case  the  deviations  from  linear  behavior  onset  at  a  higher  temperature  than  that  of

isotherm  (for  which  onsets  at  1350  K).  Thus  a  simple  conclusion  is  that  the  harder  the 

 

 

 

12

potential function the larger the deviations from linear behavior in the transition region. The same 

is true for any potential that includes less attraction than 

)36( −

potential function. 

 
One of the most striking results of the measurement of liquid-vapor coexistence curve of Rb 
and Cs,22  was the demonstration of marked departure from law of rectilinear diameter.23,24 It has 

been proposed that the reason resides in the polarization term predicted by Blazej and March in 
the effective pair potential u(r).25 It leads to an attractive (oscillatory) asymptotic contribution to 
u(r) proportional to (

oscillation  in  the  potential  function  at  long  range  does  not  introduce  detectable  effects  on  the 

linearity  of  the  (6-3)  isotherm  in  expanded  liquid  cesium,  (ii)  any  potential  function  which 

introduce  less  attraction  than  (

)3r1

  at  long  range,  results  in  an  isotherm  which  deviates  from 

linear behavior in the expanded liquid cesium. Hence, for seek of theoretical investigations, the 

dumping factor

 becomes invalid at high T (see figures 6 and 7).   

4.  E.  Role  of  linear  parameters    The  slope  of  the 

)36( −

isotherm  B  is  related  to  the 

attractive part of the 

)36( −

potential function and thus, B is expected to conform to the second 

virial coefficient 

 as the intercept A of the original LIR does in the case of normal fluids.

2B

The plot of B versus temperature for liquid cesium is shown in Fig. 8. No reliable experimental 

2B

 values are available for comparison. However, we have previously reported

metals

for which a simple relation is manipulated between equilibrium constant of the diatom formation

 calculated by integration using pair potential functions 

for singlet and triplet of atomic-collision states, corrected for the quantum effects up to the first 
28 are also shown in Fig. 8. By the plots in Fig. 8 we meant to imply an 

order quantum correction,

 

13

interesting observation that at high temperatures the slope  B  is in the same order of magnitude as

  calculated  by  the  two  methods  mentioned  above.  At  the  critical  point,  where  the  average 

coordination  number  in  liquid  cesium  is  known  to  be  almost  2,  they  compare  well.  The  recent 

molecular  dynamic  studies  of  liquid  cesium  for  the  pair  potential  has  came  up  to  a  similar 
29 The result of this studies have been used to calculate the bulk modulus, which the 

conclusion.

reciprocal  isothermal  compressibility.  As  the  temperature  increases,  the  theoretical  (computer 

simulation)  bulk  modulus  becomes  more  agreeable  with  the  experimental  one,  and  at  Tc  the 

differences become less that the experimental error. This has been attributed to the contribution of 

the electron gas which diminishes as the metallic character is replace by non-metallic one in the 

expanded liquid metal. Thus, as 

 is approached electron gas make no appreciable contribution 

cT

to compressibility indicating localization of valence electrons and formation of small molecular 

clusters.  

The property of the slope B can be studied further by rearrangement of the 

)36( −

isotherm, 

which leads to the following virial (like) equation of state: 

 

B1Z

2C
ρ+ρ+=

. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(13) 

In  Eqs.  (9)  and  (13),  terms  B  and  C  are  used  to  imply  that  second  and  third  virial  (like) 

coefficients,  respectively,  may  be  traced  from  attraction  and  repulsion  of  the 

)36( −

potential 

function. On the contrary (12-6) isotherm (e.g., the original LIR) on rearrangement will produce a 

virial equation of state up to fifth virial coefficient with the second and forth virial coefficients 

missing.  To  the  authors  knowledge’s,  this  is  the  characteristic  that  is  observed  (i)  using  the 

procedure  followed  plus 

)36( −

potential  function  only,  and  (ii)  is  obtained  regardless  of  fluid 

under  investigation,  recalling  however  this  particularly  might  be  applicable  only  to  those  fluid 

systems obeying the model presented in this work. The further generalizations of these results are 

under investigation. 

 

The  Eq.  (13)  can  be  analyzed  numerically  for  the  contribution  of  attraction  and  repulsion 

interactions. Contributions of these two interaction terms are shown in Table II. Here two points 

are noticeable. The first is that, in all cases the attraction term and the repulsion term is not only 

in the same order of magnitude but also very close to each other. The second, if for the time being 

we  treat  the  equation  (13)  as  a  truncated  series,  it  is  seen  that  at  low  temperature  the  series  is 

likely  to  diverge,  while  likely  it  converges  at  high  temperatures.  Either  convergence  or 

 

14

divergence is slow. The second feature above is nicely predicted by theory and is attributed to the 
characteristics  of  the  (6-3)  potential.  The  potential  function  with  the  term  (
integral 

  cause  that  the 

)3r1

 

∫

(
ru)T,r(gr 2
∂∂

)dr

  

changes slowly with r. The integral diverges slightly only at low T where 

)T,r(g

 corresponds to 

a  highly  structured  fluid,  and  converges  slowly  at  high  temperature  where 

)T,r(g

  has  the 

characteristics  of  an  expanding  fluid.  These  are  consistent  with  the  numerical  data  in  Table  II. 

Hence prediction of accurate thermodynamic properties seems to be logical because the Eq. (13) 

gives the whole contributions (without a reminder, which is the specification of a truncated (real) 

virial series). 

 

The  perfect  linearity  of  the  isotherm  in  the whole liquid range permits extrapolation of the 

equation  of  state  to  the  region  of  density  where  the  experimental  difficulties  do  not  allow 

measurements.  This  plus  the  fact  that  the  slope  B  and  the  intercept  C  are  linear  functions  of 

T1

[see  Figs.  9(a)  and  9(b)]  indicate  the  advantages  of  the  isotherm  derived  using 

)36( −

potential function. 

5. Conclusions 

In  this  work,  the  two-parameter 

6( −

)3

potential  function  has  introduced  for  compressed  liquid 

cesium  and  according  to  that,  the  exact  thermodynamic  equation  of  state  has  been  solved. 

6( −

)3

potential function accounts appropriately for the large attraction at long range and a soft 

repulsion at the short range. The equation of state, introduced as linear isotherm, persist the linear 

behavior in dense region, where typically liquid cesium has a solid like matrix structure, and in 

the low density (expanded liquid), where it changes  gradually  from  metal  character  into  a  non-

metal kind. It persists linear even at the critical temperature, where rarely an equation of state acts 

analytically. The attraction of 

6( −

)3

potential is overwhelmingly large such that it seems to be a 

(lump)  sum  for  ion-ion  interaction  in  high  density  liquid  plus  all  sort  of  long  range  multipolar 

interactions present in the expanded liquid cesium. By this approach, the potential periodicity of 

the  lattice  at  large  r  can  be  included,  though  it  leaves  no  detectable  effect  on  the  calculated 

15

 

 

 

thermodynamic  properties.  The  molecular  parameters  of  the  potential  function 

mr

  and 

ε have 

calculated  from  the  PVT  data  of  liquid  state.  The  value  of 

  depends  explicitly  on  the  linear 

mr

parameters 

C ,B

 (e.g., interaction parameters), and the structure of unit cell K. It increases quite 

steadily with temperature. The model of this work has treated 

ε as the binding energy of the pair 

of atoms 1 and 2 in the ensemble of N-2 other atoms of the liquid and accordingly found as an 

explicit  function  of 

C ,B

,  and  temperature.  At  the  freezing  temperature  of  cesium,  the

isotherm reproduces

 of the experimental value.

The 

6( −

potential  function  is  a  reliably  applicable  in  the  range  of  freezing  to  critical 

temperature.  The  existence  of  a  definite  temperature  dependence  of  (6-3)  potential  function, 

which is due to an appreciable decrease in the density with increasing temperature, could serve as 

an additional criterion for the model constructed. This work is also a check of our pervious work

investigations, which are undertaken, in order to conclude its physical insight and its impact on 

the thermodynamics of liquid alkali metals.

Abstract

A qualitative understanding of the greenhouse effect has long been available

through models based on globally- and time-averaged quantities.  We examine

here a simple 864-cell climatological model that emphasizes vertical radiative

energy transport within each cell.  It reproduces yearly average temperatures

obtained earlier from one of these global models and predicts a locally distributed

non-radiative flux when observed temperatures are employed as input data.

Vertical and lateral transport of latent heat do not appear explicitly in this model.

They are apparently handled well by one non-radiative flux variable, SNR, which

shows a strong latitude dependence.  Only the Sahara desert and Saudi Arabian

regions appear to be complex.  For those interested in climatology and

construction of climate models, our model provides constraints upon specifying

averaged non-radiative energy transport. The model is a useful stepping-stone for

learning about radiative energy transfer into and out of Earth’s atmosphere and for

representing the results of more sophisticated models.

I.  INTRODUCTION

The recent gradual increase in Earth’s average temperature [1] has

generated interest in both public and scientific circles.  The purpose of this paper

is to construct a very simple model capable of representing results similar to those

found by more sophisticated calculations while allowing physicists not in the field

to focus on understanding the basic energetics in climatology.  Introductory

atmosphere and climatology texts such as Goody and Walker [2] and Hartmann

[3] and the more advanced work of Peixoto and Oort [4] detail the basic physics:

the actual problems encountered in constructing climate models are summarized

in Trenberth [5]. We concentrate solely on certain aspects of the energy transfer at

a basic level; more sophisticated treatments do exist [6–9].  Moreover, this paper

deals exclusively with a representation of observational material that can be

useful because it imposes constraints on assumptions used in the treatment of

transverse transport of latent energy in more detailed climate models.

Despite the complexities of the real atmosphere, the global annual average

temperature of 288 K (ref. [3], p. 2) may be estimated with remarkably few

modifications of the classic homogeneous black-body model of Earth [3,10–13].

The present paper extends our earlier model [11], in which the ground and

atmosphere, for the entire Earth, were represented by two radiating heat reservoirs

that could exchange energy.  Both could radiate into space and both received

energy from the Sun.  Energy balance was achieved by introducing one non-

radiative flux SNR (see Sec. II,  below).

In this paper, instead of treating the entire earth as a single entity, we

replace its surface (and atmosphere) by a covering set of non-interacting cells.  In

– 3 –

each cell, vertical energy balance, with the addition of one non-radiative source, is

specified by the procedure of [11].  The 864-cell division is that used in a detailed

professional climate model [14].  For each cell we used observed mean values of

surface reflectivity, mean cloudiness, and insolation appropriate to the latitude

and time of year.

There are two approaches. With a simple assumption for the form of SNR,

one finds a reasonable representation of the observed surface temperature [15].

This is a simplification of the extensive parameterization used by, e. g., Budyko

[7] for representing cloud cover, evaporation rates, release of latent energy, etc.

Alternatively if one uses the observed surface temperatures one finds a close

dependence of SNR on latitude and time of year.  The term SNR includes general

transverse transfer of energy from equatorial cells to polar region cells.

II. THE BASIC MODEL EQUATIONS

We first briefly review the two-layer model which makes use of the fact

that the incoming solar radiation (at ~500 nm) and the outgoing terrestrial

radiation (at ~ 10 µm) occupy distinct spectral regions.  We refer to these as

“solar” and “IR,” respectively (for details of the spectral distributions see [11],

Fig. 2, and [4], Figs. 6.1, 6.2).  The atmosphere layer (a heat reservoir), at

temperature TA, has a solar reflectivity and absorptivity rA and a, respectively, and

an IR absorptivity ε.  The symbols a and ε are used here in place of f and g in the

original paper but all other notation is preserved. The surface layer (also a heat

reservoir), at temperature TE, has a solar reflectivity rS and is assumed to absorb

– 4 –

all incident IR.  The solar radiation has a flux S0 = 342 Wm–2 when averaged over

time and over the surface of the earth.  When the solar radiation hits the upper

layer, a fraction rA is reflected and the fraction that enters the layer is (1–rA).  Of

this, a(1–rA) is absorbed.  In this first pass the surface therefore receives

(1–rA)(1–a), of which rS is reflected, leaving (1–rA)(1–a)(1–rS) as the total fraction

of original incident solar flux to be absorbed at the surface. Following this logic, a

diagram can be constructed showing all the fractions of absorbed and reflected

radiation including the term SNR for non-radiative upward energy transfer (Fig. 1)
for each cell.  When multiple reflections are included, a factor kM = (1– rA rS)–1

appears in terms involving reflections between the surface and atmosphere.  The

non-radiative flux SNR, which served as an arbitrary model parameter in the global

calculation, will be seen to play a much greater role in the current work;  it shows

that horizontal transport of energy is effective.

The energy balance equations for the upper and surface layer take the form

on the right hand sides and net outgoing IR flux on the left.  Here SA and SE are

defined as the ideal Stefan-Boltzmann fluxes SA = σTA

Global and time averages of all the parameters are inserted and equations (1) are

easily solved for SA and SE, from which temperatures TA and TE are then obtained.

This original model was used to investigate broadly the effect of non-solar-related

energy sources at the surface.

III.  DETAILS OF THE CELLULAR MODEL

A.  Rationale and design

The model is now extended by averaging surface features and insolation

for individual cells.  We choose the grid scheme used by Hansen et al. [14] in

which the earth’s surface is divided into 864 cells of dimension 8º x 10º (latitude

by longitude). For each of the 864 cells, the land fraction and the annually

averaged parameters for observed total cloud cover fraction, calculated incoming

annual average solar radiation, and land and sea reflectivities are stored. We then

assume that Equations (1) are satisfied within each cell independently of other

cells [16].   The land fraction fland(n) is taken directly from Hansen et al. [14].  It is

shown by contours in Fig. 2, which establishes the scale and resolution of

subsequent maps.  The 18-year average annual cloud fraction coverage was taken

from data collected by satellites from 1983 to 2001 under the International

Satellite Cloud Climatology Project [17].  Similarly, surface reflectivities (rS)

were estimated by using the ISCCP surface reflectivities in coordination with

Table 4.2 in Hartmann [3].  Hartmann specifies albedo ranges and typical values

– 6 –

for distinct land types.  Table I shows the land types, albedo ranges, and typical

albedo values.  The estimates of rS are shown in Table II.  All parameters are

determined at the center of the cell and the values applied to the entire area of the

cell. The energy balance equations are then solved at each location.  When results

are compared to global values, the local values are weighted by fractional cell

area and summed.  Our model does not take into account changes in atmospheric

components, the parameters’ temperature dependence [13], or any geothermal

variations.

B. Basic astronomy

The value of a parameter g that depends on the choice of cell will be

written g(n), where unless otherwise specified, n is an arbitrarily assigned cell

number.  To calculate the incoming solar radiative flux to a cell, we use

astronomical definitions and notations to track the sun’s position relative to a

cell’s midpoint throughout the year. The incident radiation is the solar radiation at
the distance to the earth, 1368 Wm–2 multiplied by the sine of H(n), where H(n) is

the angle of the sun from the horizon of the surface area in cell n,

where β is the latitude, δ is the sun’s declination angle, t´ is the time elapsed since

the vernal equinox, and t is the hour angle.  During the average over 24-hour

– 7 –

periods, the angle t is limited by sunrise and sunset conditions, i. e., there is no

contribution when sin H is negative.  The annual average of S0 as a function of

latitude computed from Eq. (3) is plotted in Fig. 3, along with the observed SE and

TE.  Eq. (3) is adequate for the purposes of our average annual model.  For more

precise work, monthly averages would require a slight correction of at most ±3%

resulting from Earth’s orbital eccentricity.  The annual average solar irradiance
ranges from a minimum of 176 Wm–2 at the poles to 416 Wm–2 at the equator,
with a global annual average of 342 Wm–2.

C.  Other cell parameters

Since the solar reflectivities and the absorptivities of the cloud layer vary

from cell to cell, the solar parameters A and B, Eqs. (2a,b), also become cell-

dependent.  There are three relevant cell-varying parameters, the solar

reflectivities and the absorptivity of the cloud layer.  The surface reflectivity rS(n)

of cell n is taken from sea and land reflectances (see Table I) weighted by the

corresponding surface type fractions,

This formula was used only in high latitude regions (|lat| ≥60 degrees).

where the clear air albedo (rclear) can be assumed as 0.15 (Ref. [3], page 75). The

cell value of the planetary albedo αP(n) is the fraction of original unabsorbed

incident solar radiation that leaves the system.  On our model (see [11], eq. B3) it

There then are two whole-planet parameters left to specify, rcloud and acloud. To

estimate then, we impose a set of reasonable planetary albedo values (ref. [3], Fig.

2.9a, page 33) as a constraint upon Eq. (7).  Values of rcloud and acloud were varied

at intervals of 0.01 until we had the greatest number matches with the known

αP(n).  With this bare minimum of free parameters, a match to observed values

occurred in 711 of the 864 cells.  Most of the remaining cells, having more than

15% difference from the Hartmann values, are near the poles.  The result is rcloud

= 0.27 and acloud = 0.06, in reasonable agreement with the parameters found in

[11].  These produce not only a good localized match but also give the commonly

accepted global planetary albedo of 0.30 when averaged.  Once adopted, these

values of rcloud and acloud are not changed in the course of the calculations.

– 9 –

The cellular IR absorptivity ε(n), which is also the cellular IR emissivity,

is taken to have the same form as the solar absorptivity, Eq. (8).  Parameters used

were εcloud = 1 and εclear = 0.90.

IV.  APPLICATION OF THE MODEL

It is important to realize that SNR really consists of three terms:  a true

vertical transport of non-radiative energy, a contribution from heat flowing in

from neighboring cells, and accumulation of systematic errors.  One should not

conclude that we have neglected lateral transport of energy into each cell because

it does not appear as another term in the equations.  Actually a portion of the

lateral heat flows will be effectively redirected into a vertical heat flux; the

quantity SNR will include this contribution.  Consider, for example, a horizontal

wind, carrying water vapor from one cell to the next.  When the vapor precipitates

in the form of rain, it releases latent energy.  That energy release contributes to

the vertical energy balance in the (receptor) cell.  This energy enters

“horizontally” into the cell.  Similarly, in some nearby cell, some vertical energy

flux went into evaporation, and that cell suffers an energy loss if the water vapor

is transported out of the cell.  Since our cells are large, we do not expect the

horizontal energy transport to cover more than one or two cells, for local

disturbances.  Consequently there may be a correlation between a loss of SNR in

one cell and a gain in SNR in a nearby cell.  The annual latitude dependence of

SNR, which will be discussed in Sec. V, may well be made up of such transport

contributions.  Finally, the radiative transfer in the model used is greatly

– 10 –

simplified and it would not be surprising for systematic errors to be introduced

because of it; all systematic errors end up in the SNR term.  Another systematic

error may arise from our assumption that the theory continues to work at latitudes

having long periods of low solar irradiance, when cloud cover may vary

significantly between polar winter and summer periods.

A(n) and B(n) are given by equations identical to (2a,b) in which certain

parameters are made cell dependent, as discussed above.

There is a class of models in which SNR is assumed, given as a function of

other atmospheric parameters.  In this case, we refer to these applications of the

model as “TE-predictive.”  For example, we allowed the annual average value of

SNR(n) to depend on land and sea fraction and took it to be proportional to the

solar input, as follows:

(11)

From the solution of each pair of Eqs. (10a,b) for SE(n), TE(n) was calculated on

the basis of the assumed SNR(n).  The numerical coefficients in Eq. (11) were

chosen by an extensive search of parameter space to produce the observed global

average temperatures (TE = 288 K, TA = 250 K).  This flux has a global average of

– 11 –

42.3 Wm–2, an improvement on the one-dimensional model [11] in that the latter

had been unable to accommodate any non-zero average SNR without

compromising other assumed input parameters.  We emphasize that the only

completely arbitrary parameters in the fit were the two numerical coefficients in

Eq. (11).  We consider this remarkable; it endorses the general reasonableness of

the elementary two-temperature model for individual cells.  The form of Eq. (11)

also suggests a global asymmetry in the distribution of SNR.  We return to this

later.

The preliminary cell results are shown in Fig. 4a and are compared with

measured values (satellite data [17]), Fig. 4b.  These diagrams show how a set of

calculated locally-determined temperatures (Fig. 4a) having the correct global

average may disagree significantly from observed local values (Fig. 4b) having

the same global average.  While this is not the least bit surprising, a comparison

of the two parts of Fig. 4 provides a qualitative evaluation of the errors that occur

in the making of simple models. Comparison of the two panels shows the

calculated temperatures are ~5–10 K too high in equatorial regions and ~5–10 K

too low in the temperate zones.  Considering the simplicity of the model, the

agreement is quite good, but the values of the two needed parameters are far from

being uniquely determined.

B.  Predicting SNR(n)

The linear equations (1a,b or 10a,b) lend themselves equally to computing

any two of the quantities SNR , SA, and SE, given the third one and S0 as an input.

– 12 –

Therefore, we may take TE(n) as known input parameters from ISCCP satellite

data [17] and S0(n) from Eq. (3), and use the balance equations to calculate SA(n)

and SNR(n).  This “SNR-predictive” mode of calculation is accomplished most

easily by combining the two flux equations (10a,b),

(13)

The results for the annual average of SNR(n), calculated from the observed surface

temperature TE(n), are shown in Figure 5a.  SNR(n) and SA(n) have global averages
of 64 and 236 Wm–2 (the latter corresponding to TA = 254 K), respectively.  In the

earlier non-cellular model [11], the highest value of SNR that could be obtained
without unreasonable parameters was 40 Wm–2, and in the above TE-predictive
mode it was 42.3 Wm–2, so the SNR-predictive mode result 64 Wm–2 represents a

further improvement.  The generally quoted global average of SNR is 102–105
Wm–2 [19,20].  SNR(n) appears to be most negative at the higher latitudes and

most positive near the equator.  A negative value of SNR(n) corresponds to non-

radiative energy transfer from the atmospheric layer to the surface layer or a

lateral flow into the cell, as discussed earlier.

A distinctive feature of our results is the prominent drop of SNR in the

regions of the Sahara and Saudi Arabia, Figs. 5a and 5b, at matrix elements

(20–25, 14–16).  Its cause is a confluence of strong effects on the two terms in Eq.

(12):  relatively high surface reflectivity and low cloud cover, which reduce the

– 13 –

first term, and relatively high temperature, which increases the absolute value of

the (negative) second term.  A similar but milder dip appears in the eastern region

of Australia.  Aside from these anomalies, the residuals are generally small (see

below).

C.  The zonal average of SNR

“Zonal” averages are made over cells lying within zones having the same

latitude.  Following convention [21], we denote zonal averages by angular

brackets 〈...〉. If the area of cell n = (p,q) is A(p,q), where p is the latitude cell

index and q is the longitude cell index, we have , for example,

measured in degrees, at the center of the cell and we will write, again for example,

.  The zonal averages SNR(β) are shown explicitly in Figure 6,

where a very regular latitude dependence emerges clearly.  Indeed, SNR(β) can be

(16)

with ∆ = 5 degrees.  In Figure 6 the residuals between SNR(β) and its fit are also

shown.  When the zonal average is removed from the cellular results shown in

– 14 –

Fig. 5a, the residuals shown in Fig. 5b are obtained.  The zonally averaged

residuals are also shown in Fig. 6.

Both the general smoothness and the relatively small size of the residuals,

on the order of 5–10% of the solar input, establish the fact that Eq. (16) is not

simply an average but a useful average.  It probably represents both latitude

gradient in the amount of vertical latent heat transport (more evaporation and

condensation in equatorial regions) and horizontal transport of energy from

equatorial to polar regions.

It is not surprising that SNR(β) has an asymmetry between the northern and

southern hemispheres.  In retrospect we see that the ad hoc form, Eq. (11), used in

the TE-predictive calculation, was biased toward the southern hemisphere where

the sea fraction is dominant.  Figure 7 shows the 18-year average surface

reflectivity in months 1 and 7 [17], giving further insight into the peculiarities of

SNR.  The reflectivities are slightly higher in the northern temperate zone than in

the southern.  In the polar regions, the times of greater solar irradiance may not

occur when the surface reflectance is at its average value.  Indeed, the polar

regions are generally rather anomalous.  We have not concerned ourselves too

much with them because the model, generally limited to dealing with annual

averages, lacks the ability to describe accurately the effect of Arctic and Antarctic

nights in which S0(n) = 0.  There is some seasonal variation in the cloud cover

data and this may be responsible for the fact that the interesting term –10sin6|β|

does not hold in the polar regions.  One is tempted to speculate on the origin of

the sinusoidal term:  the insolation does not have a pure cosβ  dependence

– 15 –

because of the inclination of Earth’s axis to the plane of its orbit; and Hadley cells

[22] may play a role in it.

The existence of extensive databases provides the student an opportunity

to explore many other effects through the medium of this theory.  As an example,

we have used data from ISCCP [17] consisting of averages of the measured

parameters over an 18-year period at each month.  For each month, the average

SNR(β,t) was calculated and compared to SNR(β) by looking at the difference

between the two.  This difference also appears to follow a trend that is most clear

in the region between latitudes –60° and +60°.  For this region the difference is

approximately linear and oscillates about β = 0° with a period of one year.  The

difference itself can be fitted well to

Now, we have shown that the annual average SNR follows Eq. (16), and

the difference between monthly and annual values follow Eq. (17), so the monthly

SNR can be written as

in the specified region –60° ≤ β ≤ +60°.  For the month of January, the values of

SNR calculated directly from the data are compared to those given by Eq. (18) in

Figure 8.  The fitting is very close to the calculated values in the region –30° ≤ β
≤ +45°.  The discrepancies of up to 50 Wm–2 outside this region are most likely

due to the hemispheric asymmetry of SNR.  This asymmetry was ignored in Eq.

(17) which is antisymmetric about β = 0° and uses a perfectly sinusoidal

– 16 –

maximum value for β = ±60°.  The calculations from data, however, show that
during the southern summer, SNR(–60°,t) increases to close to 400 Wm–2, but in
the northern summer SNR(+60°,t) does not even reach 300 Wm–2.  Also, at any

month, the value of SNR (60°,t) does not equal SNR(–60°,t), as in Eq. (17), leading

to an over- or under-estimation of SNR from Eq. (18).

Finally, in Figure 9 we compare averages of SNR over two months in

succession (February and March 1995).  The 18-year average for the respective

months has been subtracted and the polar regions have been omitted from the

diagram because average monthly variations in reflectivities and cloud cover may
be large.  Deviations of the order of 50 Wm–2 show the presence of large-scale

persistent non-radiative “weather systems,” each of which is composed of about

20 independent cells.  These graphs show how the expected horizontal transport

of energy in the east-west direction is effected.  These systems produce deviations

in SNR much larger than those shown in Fig 5b and therefore are real.  Only when

averages are taken over the 18-year database do the smooth results given by Eqs.

(17) and (18) and Figs. 6 and 8 result, with the evidence of the east-west transport

being averaged out.  These graphs are important in that they show horizontal east-

west transport of energy can be included in our model, providing small enough

time intervals are used.

V.  SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

The two-level global model of paper I has been applied locally, that is,

each cell in a grid has been assumed to have an annual average temperature and

– 17 –

the fluxes have been determined by the cell’s own parameters and average

insolation.  The observed local planetary albedo is used as a control on the

modeled surface and atmospheric reflectivities.  In the model’s more successful

(SNR -predictive) implementation the set of surface temperatures is used as input;

the nonradiative flux from the surface SNR and the ideal atmospheric radiative flux

SA are the principal outputs.  The globally averaged SNR is predicted to be about

64% of its usually quoted global value of 102–105 Wm–2, an improvement over

TE-predictive models using assumed non-radiative fluxes, where values of only

0–40% were possible.

The value of the globally averaged atmospheric radiative flux SA is 236

Wm–2, adequate to maintain overall radiative balance with an effective

atmospheric radiative temperature of TA = 254K) (recall that the emissivity is

taken as 0.89, as in paper I).  A drawback of our one-temperature atmosphere is

that it is constrained to predict that the downward IR flux is identical to the

upward flux.  In the real atmosphere, a temperature gradient exists and the lower

layers most effective in radiating downward are at a higher temperature.  The

downward flux should thus be greater than εSA , as is observed [19].  We are

developing a three-temperature version of our model, to be the subject of paper III

in the series, using a radiative transfer model for the atmospheric structure;

according to preliminary estimates an appropriately larger value of SNR will be

obtained that will balance the extra downward IR.

Having noted a correlation between SNR(n) and latitude, we examined its

zonal average.  There resulted a clear asymmetry between the northern and

southern hemispheres, illustrating the effect of asymmetry of the hemispheric land

– 18 –

masses and the differences in reflectivity parameters resulting from the nature of

the Arctic and Antarctica.  Fittings of other data sets to develop formulae for

individual components of SNR are discussed by Budyko [7].

We emphasize the accessibility of both the data and our model

representations to students interested in applying the elementary aspects of

climatology to real data.  As suggestions for future workers:  (1)  It would be

interesting to use data bases averaged over different periods of time to see if long-

term differences in the form of Eqs. (17) and (18) result.  (2) A study of the form,

structure and persistence of these large scale monthly “weather patterns” during

an El Niño cycle should be informative.

APPENDIX A.  SPHERICAL ASTRONOMY FUNDAMENTALS

The altitude H of the sun can be found by applying the law of cosines [23]

to the observer's spherical triangle ∆ZNS where Z is the observer's zenith, N is the

north celestial pole, and S is the sun.  Then arc ZS is 90° – H;  arc NZ is 90° – β,

where β is the latitude, and arc NS is 90° – δ, where δ is the declination of the

sun, available from a table look-up in (e.g.)[24].

The angle ∠SNZ is called the Sun’s hour angle H; instead of being

measured in degrees it is measured in time units from 12:00 noon (1 hour = 15°).

It is negative (positive) when the Sun is in the eastern (western) half of the sky.

These quantities are related by the spherical law of cosines,

sin

,

(A1)

At sunrise, H = 0; the equation determines the time at sunrise t = –t0.  At sunset,

again H = 0 and t = +t0.  The length of day is then 2t0.

The declination of the sun can also be approximated.  The sun moves

along a great circle, called the ecliptic, which is inclined at an angle i = 23.44° to

the celestial equator.  At the vernal equinox (~March 21) the sun is at a point V,

one of the two intersections of the celestial equator and the ecliptic, and is moving

from negative to positive declination.  Let the point P be on the celestial equator,

with arc NSP = 90°.  Consider the spherical triangle VSP.  The angle ∠SVP = ι

and the angle ∠SPV = 90°.  The arc VS is approximately Ωt´ where Ω = 360°/1yr

and t´ is the time elapsed since the vernal equinox.  From the spherical law of

sines for VSP one has:

δ =

Since the Sun moves slightly faster (slower) on the ecliptic than average

when we are at perihelion, January (aphelion, July), this is only an approximate

relation.

Table II. Corrected values for land and sea reflectivities in the high latitudes (see

text). A negative latitude corresponds to the southern hemisphere. For –76° to

–89° rland is set at 0.6 because of the year-round Antarctic ice. The latitude –68°

reflectivity is set slightly lower than Antarctica as a result of a lack of permanent

ice.  In latitudes 68° to the north pole , r gradually increases, taking seasonal snow

and ice into account. rsea at 60° and –60° is set at 0.3 to avoid a sharp jump from

water set at 0.1 in the mid-latitudes to the higher polar values for ice and snow

cover. These values are rough estimates for partial and seasonal snow and ice

cover. Fresh snow can have an albedo up to 0.9, old, melting snow up to 0.65, and

sea ice without snow cover up to 0.4 ( see [3], table 4.2, p. 88).  Values not shown

(- - -) are longitude-dependent and are taken directly from satellite data in detail.

18. The ISCCP data for rS was not used in regions above ± 52° latitude,

because the data sometimes are greater than unity as a result of glaring and

the angle of the satellite to the northern and southern polar regions.  This

being inconsistent with our definition of a reflection coefficient, the

surface reflectivities in these regions were estimated from the Hartmann

[3] table 4.2.

Figure captions

1. Movement of radiative and non-radiative energy in the two layer

schematic.  Horizontal arrows indicate deposition in the layer.  Lighter

arrows represent radiation that is either reflected, or passed through a layer

unabsorbed. Multiple reflections of solar radiation are accounted for by
the factor kM in Eqs. (1a) and (1b) in the text.  The factors αp, A, and B are
the overall fractions of S0 that are reflected, absorbed by the upper payer,
and absorbed by the lower layer, respectively.  Other symbols as defined

in the text.

2. Global land fraction plotted with contours at 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75.  This map

may be used as a template in the study of Figs. 4, 5, and 7.  It also gives a

good indication of the resolution afforded by our 864-cell calculations.

Horizontal axis:  ticks correspond to centers of 10° cells located (centered)

at longitudes –180°(1), –170°(2), ..., 0°(19), ..., +170°(36).  Vertical axis:

ticks correspond to centers of 8°cells at latitudes –84°(2), –76°(3), ...,

–4°(12), +4°(13), ..., +84°(23).  The bottom and top rows correspond to

centers of 2° cells at –89°(1) and +89°(24), respectively.

3. Average annual insolation (light solid curve and right-hand scale),

outward infrared flux from the surface (dashed curve, right-hand scale),

and surface temperature (heavy curve, left-hand scale) as a function of

latitude.  The latter two are latitude averages based on satellite temperature

data [17].

4.

(a) Computed “TE-predictive mode” surface temperatures (in K) using a
direct cellular extension of the elementary model of reference [11], as
described in the text.  The average non-radiative flux is 40 Wm–2 and the
average surface temperature is 288 K.  (b) Observed surface temperatures,

defined as those obtained by satellite [17], with an average of 288 K.  See
the caption of Fig. 2 for the key to the axes.  In both of these plots, most of

– 30 –

the regional variation in surface temperature comes from the latitudinal

variation of insolation and from the geographic variation of albedo.

5.

(a)  Computed “SNR-predictive mode” non-radiative flux SNR(n), in Wm–2,
using the cellular model but with surface temperatures as input.  (b)
δSNR(n), the residue after subtracting the annual average value of SNR(n) as
a function of latitude (see Eq. 17).  The region of large residuals

corresponds to the Sahara desert region. See the caption of Fig. 2 for the

key to the axes.

6. Distribution of SNR by latitude.  Squares represent the “experimental”

values based on our model, and diamonds are the numerical fit, Eq. (16).

Triangles are the residuals.

7. Comparison of surface reflectivities in the months of January (a) and July

(b).  The asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres seen

in many climatological studies can be appreciated from the variability in

the north polar region and the near-invariance in the south polar region.

See the caption of Fig. 2 for the key to the axes.

8. A sample determination of nonradiative flux SNR for the month of January

(18-year average).  Diamonds: values determined from our model

calculation.  Squares: value determined from the fitting function, Eq. (18).
The fit is meant to be valid for latitudes satisfying –60° ≤ β ≤ +60°.

9.

(a)  The monthly values of SNR for February 1995 minus the 18-year
average value of SNR for February, for the temperate zones.  Large
deviations, ~50 Wm–2, in large-scale “weather” patterns are seen.  (b)
Similar to (a), for March 1995.  Comparing with February, it can be seen

that some non-radiative “weather cells” (indicated by shading) persist for

at least a month and some (indicated by stippling) are more ephemeral.

The largest features cover 10 to 20 cells, each computed independently.

Abstract. Evolutionally conserved quantity that specifies folding nuclei is pursued by a 
case  study  for  a  small  protein  (PDB  code:  1ten).  First  it  is  demonstrated  that  the 

sequences of amino acids at folding nuclei are not conserved. Then 3D (3-dimensional) 

information  of  the  structure  is  considered  and  it  is  found  that  a  3D  hydrophobicity 

profile  is  essential  to  specify  the  folding  nuclei  and  evolutionally  conserved.  This 

profile  is  maintained  by  the  interaction,  including  entropic  effect,  among  amino  acids 
realized in the native state structure. Experimentally observed  φ-value is correlated to 
this 3D hydrophobicity profile after taking into account the effect of the contact distance 

in amino-acid sequence.

1.    Introduction 

 
In the process of protein folding the dynamics is heterogeneous and folding nuclei play 
a  crucial  role.  Such  folding  nuclei  are  identified,  for  example,  byφ-value  analysis  in 
protein  engineering  experiments  [1].  Recently  it  has  been  intensively  discussed  [2] 

whether the sequence of amino acids at the folding nucleus is evolutionally conserved. 

The conclusion seems to be negative [3]; the sequence is not evolutionally conserved. 

Then we try to find an evolutionally conserved quantity specifying folding nuclei in this 

paper.   

    As  a  case  study  we  focus  our  attention  to  a  small  protein  (PDB  code:  1ten)  whose 

folding nuclei are exhaustively studied [4]. First we check that the amino-acid sequence 

at the folding nucleus is not evolutionally conserved. Thus folding nuclei are not easily 

decided  from  1D  (1-dimensional)  information  of  the  sequence.  Then  we  consider  3D 

(3-dimensional) information of the structure and find that a 3D-hydrophobicity profile 

to  specify 

is  essential 

(HP) 
the  folding  nuclei  and  evolutionally  conserved. 
Experimentally observed  φ-value is not directly correlated to this 3D-HP, since the  φ
-value is affected by the contact distance in amino-acid sequence. We can analyze the 
φ-value  taking  this  effect  of  the  contact  distance  into  account.  Consequently  we  see 
that the folding nuclei are specified by the 3D-HP and this profile is maintained by the 

interaction among amino acids realized in the native state structure.   

2.    Non-Conservation of Sequence   
 

After  recent  intensive  discussions  it  has  been  concluded  that  the  sequence  of  amino 

acids  at  the  folding  nucleus  is  not  evolutionally  conserved  [5]  on  the  basis  of  the 

evaluation of the entropy. We also check the non-conservation for our case of 1ten.

Figure 1. Correlation between the entropy S(l) and the  φ-value  φ(l). The entropy for the l-th residue, 

S(l), is calculated as S(l) = -  ∑i pi(l) log pi(l) using the ensemble of 48 proteins resembling 1ten, obtained 

by HSSP in May 2005. Here pi(l) is the probability for finding an amino acid belonging to the i-th group 
in the l-th residue. The 6 groups are defined in the main text. The  φ-value at the l-th residue,  φ(l), is 

taken from the experiment [4]. The data points for folding nuclei are circled.   

    We  calculate  the  entropy  of  the  amino-acid  sequence  by  using  6-group  scheme  [6] 

where  20  kinds  of  amino  acids  are  classified  into  6  groups  by  their  physico-chemical 

properties; {ALA , VAL , LEU , ILE , MET , CYS}, {PHE , TRP , TYR , HIS }, {SER , 

THR  ,  ASN  ,  GLN  },  {KYS  ,  ARG},  {ASP  ,  GLU}  and  {GLY  ,  PRO}.  In  this 

calculation amino acids in the same group are not distinguished so that the tendency for 

evolutional conservation is favored.   

    Hereafter we focus our attention to 6 folding nuclei [4], (the amino acid; the residue 

number  in  this  paper,  the  residue  number  in  PDB):  (ILE;  20,  821),  (TYR;  36,  837), 

(ILE;  48,  849),  (LEU;  50,  851),  (ILE;  59,  860)  and  (VAL;  70,  871),  on  secondary 
structures. Our mini-protein, 1ten, consists of 7  β-sheets.     
    In Figure 1 the correlation between the entropy and the  φ-value for 1ten is shown. It 
is seen that the sequence at the folding nucleus is not conserved.     

 

3.    Conservation of Hydrophobicity Profile   
 

In  the  previous  section  we  have  shown  that  the  amino-acid  sequence  at  the  folding 

nucleus is not conserved. Then we seek an evolutionally conserved quantity specifying 

folding  nuclei,  if  it  exists.  Since  folding  nuclei  are  not  easily  decided  from  1D 

information of the sequence, we consider 3D information of the structure.   

A similar situation has been encountered in the study of the helix-turn-helix motif and 

it  has  been  shown  that  3D  keynote  [7],  which  consists  of  pairs  of  amino  acids,  can 

characterize  the  structure  of  the  motif.  The  pairs  are  expected  to  have  some 

correspondence to the folding nuclei. Thus we try to make the 3D keynote for 1ten. The 

pair  is  identified  by  the  number  of  interactions  between  two  amino  acids.  The 

interaction is assigned to each pairs of atoms, excluding hydrogen, if the diameter of the 
pair is smaller than 6 Å. In Figure 2 the number of interactions belonging to the amino 
acid is shown as a function of the sequence. The correlation between the number and the 
φ-value  is  subtle  so  that  the  3D  keynote  does  not  work  for  specifying  the  folding 
nuclei.

Figure 2. The number of interactions belonging to the amino acid, which is basic for the 3D key note, as a 

function of the sequence. The interaction is assigned to each pairs of atoms, excluding hydrogen, if the 
diameter  of  the  pair  is  smaller  than  6  Å.  The  protein  1ten  consists  of  7  β-sheets  represented  as  the 

horizontal segments (upper) [4], while in PDB assignment 8 segments (lower) exist.   

 

    In the case of protein folding in general the formation of hydrophobic core plays an 

essential role. However, this entropic effect is not taken into account in the analysis of 

3D  keynote.  Thus  we  introduce  a  3D  hydrophobicity  in  order  to  examine  the 

hydrophobic effect. The 3D hydrophobicity for an amino acid is defined as the sum of 
the  values  of  hydrophobicity  [8]  of  amino  acids  within  12  Å  from  it.  This  3D 
hydrophobicity  reflects  the  structure  of  the  native  state.  The  structure  is  decided  by 

interactions, including entropic effect, among amino acids. Here the folding nuclei are 

related  to  the  formation  of  hydrophobic  core.  In  Figure  3  the  3D-HP  is  shown  as  a 
function of the sequence. The 3D hydrophobicity and the  φ-value is correlated so that 
the  3D  hydrophobicity  can  specify  the  folding  nuclei.  The  correlation  is  further 
discussed in the next section.

Figure 3. The 3D hydrophobicity profile as a function of amino-acid sequence. The 3D hydrophobicity 
for an amino acid is defined as the sum of the values of hydrophobicity of amino acids within 12 Å from it 

in the native state structure. The distance between amino acids is determined by that for Cβ's. In the case 

of GLY the position of Cα is employed exceptionally. 

 

    In order to see the evolutional property of the 3D-HP we plot several profiles with the 

highest  Z-scores  in  HSSP  compared  with  1ten  in  Figure  4.  From  this  plot  it  can  be 

concluded  that  the  3D-HP  is  evolutionally  conserved.  In  Figure  5  the  correlation 

between  the  degree  of  conservation  and  the  compactness  determined  by  the  distances 

among folding nuclei is shown. From this correlation it can be said that the structure in 

the native state is maintained by the 3D-HP. Here we have employed the compactness of 

the folding nuclei. On the other hand, it is hard to find key correlation shown in Figure 5 

by the analysis of the whole structures of proteins, since the fragile loops are arranged to 

support the compactness but lead to the deviation of the structure.

analysis, since it has many gapped regions in sequence alignment. 

   

In this section we have found that the 3D-HP is essential to specify the structure in 

the native state and evolutionally conserved. This 3D-HP is a mean-field description of 

interactions, including entropic effect, among amino acids.

Figure  5.  The  correlation  between  the  degree  of  conservation  and  the  compactness.  The  degree  of 

conservation  is  the  mean  of  the  deviation  squared  of  the  3D  hydrophobicity  subtracted  the  mean  3D 

hydrophobicity over the whole sequence, for each protein. The compactness is the sum of the distances 

among 6 folding nuclei. The folding nuclei for 3 proteins, 1qr4A, 1fnhA and 2mfn, are assumed to be the 

same as 1ten in residue number. The compactness for 1ten is 130.94. 

 
4.    φ-value and Contact Distance   
 

In  the  previous  section  we  have  shown  that  the  3DHP  is  evolutionally  conserved. 
However, the correlation between the 3DHP and theφ-value at the folding nuclei is not 
so good. We see a tendency that the largerφ-values are observed at the middle part of 
the  amino-acid  chain:  (the  residue  number;  theφ-value,  the  3D  hydrophobicity):  (20; 
0.38, 23.77), (36; 0.56, 18.27), (48; 0.67, 14.92), (50; 0.42, 12.66), (59; 0.62, 16.71) and 

(70; 0.54, 27.37).  Thus  we  consider  the  effect  of  the  contact  distance.  In  Figure  6  the 
correlation  between  the  ratio,  the  φ-value  versus  the  3D  hydrophobicity,  and  the 
contact distance is shown. This correlation reflects the fact that the fast processes of the 

folding  correspond  to  the  formation  of  native  contacts  at  short  distance  in  1D 

amino-acid sequence and the slow processes at long distance.

Contact Distance (sum)

 

Figure  6.  The  correlation  between  the  ratio,  the  φ-value  /  the  3D  hydrophobicity,  and  the  sum  of  the 

contact distance for folding nuclei. The contact distance is the difference in residue numbers between two 

amino  acids  contacting  in  the  native  state  structure.  The  condition  for  contacts  is  the  same  as  that 

employed in Figure 3. A similar residue-wise contact order has been discussed in another context [9].

QD

 

Figure  7.  The  correlation  between  the  ratio,  the  φ-value  /  the  3D  hydrophobicity,  and  the  number  of 
native pairs QD for folding nuclei. A native pair is a pair of two amino acids which are within 12 Å in the 
native state structure and whose distance in residue number is larger than 12. The distance between amino 

acids is determined by that for Cα's. Original QD has been discussed in a review [10].   

 

 

The same analysis can be done using the number of native pairs, QD, instead of the 
contact distance. In Figure 7 the correlation between the ratio, the  φ-value versus the 
3D hydrophobicity and QD is shown. This correlation is weaker than that in Figure 6. 
Such  a  result  supports  the  importance  of  the  contact  distance,  since  QD  lacks  the 
information of the distance in 1D amino-acid sequence.         

5.  Conclusion and Discussions   

 
In conclusion we have shown that the 3DHP is evolutionally conserved and specifies the 
folding  nuclei.  The  3DHP  correlates  with  experimentally  measured  φ-value  after 
correcting  the  effect  of  the  contact  distance.  Since  the  3DHP  is  a  physico-chemical 

property  averaged over the 3D structure of the native state, the information of the 1D 

amino-acid  sequence  is  rather  unimportant.  This  fact  can  be  an  explanation  of  the 

experimental evidence that the 3D structure is evolutionally more conserved than the 1D 

sequence, since the same 3DHP can be realized by plural different 1D sequences.

Figure 9. The 3D hydrophobicity profile with the directional weight as a function of amino-acid sequence. 

The 3D hydrophobicity for an amino acid in this case is defined in a similar manner as in Figure 3 but in 

the calculation of the sum the directional weight is multiplied where the weight is +1 for the amino acids 

whose side chain is in the inside of 1ten and –1 for outside.   

In our study it is clarified that the mean value of a physico-chemical property, the 

 

 

3DHP,  is  optimized  and  evolutionally  conserved.  Figures  8  and  9  also  support  the 

significance  of  the  mean  value.  In  Figures  8  and  9  it  is  demonstrated  that  the  zigzag 
pattern  in  hydrophobicity  along  the  amino-acid  sequence,  which  leads  to  β-sheet 
structure,  becomes  more  evident  in  the  mean  value  than  in  the  original  value  of  the 

amino  acid.  Thus  the  property  of  the  amino  acid  itself  is  rather  unimportant  but  the 

mean value realized in the native state structure after interacting with the other amino 

acids and surrounding water molecules.

Figure 10. The degree of distortion of the side chain, the inner product, in the native state structure as a 

function of amino acid sequence. The inner product is calculated for two normalized vectors, one for the 

direction of the side chain determined by Cβ  in AMBER and the other in the native state structure.   

 

 

In Figure 10 we show the difference in the directions of the side chain between the 

amino acid in the native state and that in the isolated state. It is found that the difference 

is rather small at the folding nuclei. On the other hand, in order to form tightly packed 
hydrophobic core, the side chains of amino acids involved into the core at later stage, 
inevitably deformed.   
    In  our  study  we  have  focused  our  attention  to  the  folding  nuclei  on  secondary 

structures  in  consistent  with  the  S-value  analysis  [11].  Here  we  have  assumed  a 

hierarchical  picture  of  the  folding  where  the  weak  residual  interactions  determine  the 

3D  structure  among  secondary  structures  and  the  stronger  interactions,  for  example 
hydrogen  bonding,  lead  to  secondary  structures  before  the  process  of  3D  structure 

formation.   

    In  this  paper  we  have  done  a  case  study  for  1ten,  since  it  is  simple  and  thoroughly 

studied mini-protein. In future the same analysis done in this paper should be applied to 

other proteins and our scenario should be tested for wide class of proteins.

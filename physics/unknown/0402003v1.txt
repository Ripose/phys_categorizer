ABSTRACT 

1  
Investigating the polarity time scales for the last 118 My a Bernoulli process with p= 2

overriding with a Gaussian noise have been detected for the R-N magnetic reversals.  The 

Bernoulli trials are separated by 282 ky.  The frequency of the Bernoulli process correlates to 

planetary cycles and consistent with an impact triggered global cooling mechanism.  The 

detected pattern allows calculating the probability of an upcoming R-N reversal between any 

time intervals. 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 

It has been proposed that the two kinds of magnetic reversals, normal to reverse (N-R), and 

reverse to normal (R-N) might be triggered by different mechanisms1.  Global cooling could 

result an R-N reversal while the tidal affect and/or global warming could lead to an N-R reversal.  

If the two different kinds of magnetic reversals are triggered by different mechanisms then by 

looking for a pattern in the sequences of the reversals would more accurately be detected by 

focusing analysis on those reversals, which are triggered by a common mechanism.  In the 

present study the periodicity of the R-N reversals will be investigated because these reversals are 

triggered by the same single mechanism. 

Previous studies assumed that the mechanism responsible for the triggering of the magnetic 

reversal is the same in both cases.  These studies were looking for sequences in the time series of 

the earth’s magnetic field reversals by investigating the elapsed time between two consecutive 

reversals (see, e.g. Refs 2-3).  The time sequence elapsed between the same polarity reversals has 

never been investigated. 

 

II.  DATA ANALYZIS

is the time before present of the  thi

 R-N magnetic reversal.  The number of 

data for longer time periods (

−∆

)NR(t

>1.6 My.) is very few.  These long periods were omitted 

because the available data is insufficient for statistical analysis.  The frequency distribution of 

NRt −∆

 reveals five relatively distinct groups (Figure 1).  If one assumes a Gaussian distribution 

for each of the groups, then these distributions overlap and the analyses are significantly more 

complicated.  However, since the means of the various groups lay several standard deviations 

away from each other, a more tractable way to model the groups is to determine a point between 

them such that the probability of a point being miscategorized is minimized.  To make this 

precise, consider 

1G  and 

2G data set for two consecutive groups which have (mean, standard 

deviation) (

1 σ,µ

) and (

2 ,µ σ ) respectively, and

is minimized, where  X  is a variable equal to 

NRt −∆

, 

1p  is a probability calculated from a Gaussian density function with parameters of 

1 σ,µ

1

, 

and 

2p  is a probability calculated from a Gaussian density function with parameters of  

2 ,µ σ .  

2

At first the groups were separated by visual inspection and parameters (

i σ,µ

i

) were calculated 

for each group (

iG ).  Using the calculated group parameters the minimum points 

)1i(is
+−

between 

each consecutive group were determined.  If this minimum point coincided with the initial 

assumption then the group separation was accepted.  If the minimum point did not coincide with 

the initial separation then the above procedure was repeated using the new minimum point for 

the separation.  Calculations were repeated as long as all the calculated

)1i(is
+−

 coincided with the 

initial separation point.  The calculated parameters of the separated groups are given in Figure 1.  

The means of the overlapping Gaussian distributions are 

σ86.3

 apart, therefore, the overlapping 

data on each side of the distribution is less than 1.5 percent.  This small percentage of 

overlapping does not have significant affect on the statistical parameters.  Additionally, the cut 

off parts for groups 2, 3, and 4 are close to symmetrical further reducing the overlapping affect.  

Analyzing the calculated statistical parameters, the mean values and standard deviations of 

these separated groups it was found that the mean values are integer multiples of the smallest 

mean, revealing a periodic pattern.  If we let the normalize mean of a group denote the mean of 

that group divided by its group number (e.g. group 5’s normalized mean is 0.28376 My), then we 

find that the normalized means range from 0.280 to 0.287 My.  The weighted average of the 

means is 0.28214 My, the corresponding standard deviation is 0.073 My  

The frequency distribution of the reversal time shows that the R-N reversal is more likely to 

have a shorter term than a longer one.  Calculating the relative frequency that a reversal falls into 

a group it was find that the frequency for the first group with mean of 0.28 My is 0.5.  The 

frequency of the second group (mean 0.56 My) is 0.21, while the frequency for the third group 

(mean 0.85 My) is 0.12 etc. (Figure 1).  This is just a Bernoulli process with p= 2

1  overriding 

with a Gaussian noise.  This means that for every ~0.28 My, elapsed since the previous R-N 

reversal, there is approximately 50% chance that the earth’s magnetic field would make a shift 

from a reversed to a normal orientation (Figure 2). 

III. CORRELATION WITH ASTRONOMICAL CYCLES 

The identified Bernoulli process has been stable at least for the length of the analyzed data 

set, which is about 100 My.  With this time length only astronomical cycles are known to remain 

stable.  Astronomical events; therefore, should play major role in the triggering of R-N reversals.  

This conclusion is consistent with the identified the presence of the planetary cycles in the 
strength and the inclination of the earth magnetic field for the past 2.25 My5. 

Geological observations indicates that the last two R-N reversals coincided with global 
cooling and major impacts. 6;7  The global climate oscillation is generated by the Milankovitch 
cycles8.  The bit frequency of these cycles is consistent with the frequency of the Bernoulli trials.  

Impacts could be triggered by planetary perturbations.  The beat frequency of the giant planets 
(93,418.3 y.) 9 is a harmonic of the Bernoulli trials.  The p= 2

1  probability of the Bernoulli 

process could be explained as positive and negative interferences between the Milankovitch and 

planetary cycles. 

 

 

 

 

IV. PROBABILITY OF AN R-N REVERSAL 

The detected pattern and the statistical parameters allow one to predict the probability of the 

next R-N reversal between any time intervals.  The probability of a Bernoulli trial is.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

 

 

In this study the time sequence elapsed between two consecutive R-N reversals has been 

1  
analyzed for the last 118 My.  The pattern consistent with a Bernoulli process with p= 2

overriding with a Gaussian noise.  The time sequence between the Bernoulli trials is 282 ky.  

This frequency correlates to planetary cycles and consistent with an impact triggered global 

cooling reversal mechanism.  The detected Bernoulli process allows one to calculate the 

probability of an upcoming R-N reversal between any given time interval.

In  the  above  paper  the  author  treats  the  boundary  layer  flow    along  a 
vertical isothermal plate  of an electrically conducting fluid. The plate lies 
in a vertical free stream of  constant velocity u∞, constant temperature  T∞
and  constant  mass  concentration  C∞.  The  plate  moves  vertically  with  a 
velocity  which  is  a  linear  function  of  distance  x  (uw=cx). A  transverse 
magnetic  field  with  constant  strength  B0   is  imposed  on  the  flow.  The 
boundary layer  equations are integrated  numerically.  However,  there  is a 
fundamental error  in this paper and the presented results do not have any 
practical value. This argument is explained below: 
The momentum equation used by the author is

as y →   u = u∞, T = T∞ ,  C=C∞                                                                                               (3)                                                                                                   

Let  us  apply  the  momentum  equation  at  large  y.  At  large  distances  from 
the  plate  the  fluid  temperature  is  equal  to  ambient  temperature  and  the 
buoyancy term gβ(T-T∞) in momentum equation is zero. At large distances 
from  the  plate  the  mass  concentration    is  also  equal  to  ambient 
concentration  and the buoyancy term gβ*(C-C∞) is also zero.  Taking into 
account  that,  at  large  distances  from  the  plate,  velocity  is  everywhere 
constant  and  equal  to  u∞  the  velocity  gradient  ∂u/∂y    is  also  zero.  The 
same  happens  with  the  diffusion  term  ν∂2u/∂y2.  This  means  that  the 
momentum equation takes the following form at large y

                                                                                       (4)

Taking into account that the electric conductivity, density and the strength 
of  the  magnetic  field  are  nonzero  quantities  the  free  stream  velocity 
gradient  is  nonzero  and  the  free  stream velocity  should  change  along  x. 
However this finding  is in contradiction with the assumption made in the 
paper  that  the  free  stream  velocity  is  constant.  Taking  into  account  the 
above argument it is clear that the results presented  by Ghaly (2002)  are 
inaccurate.

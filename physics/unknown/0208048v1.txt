The  “elastic  capacitor”  (EC)  model  was  first  introduced  in  studies  of  lipid  bilayers  (the  major  components  of 

biological membranes).  This electro-elastic model accounts for the compression of a membrane under applied voltage 

V  and  allows  one  to  obtain  information  about  the  membrane’s  elastic  properties  from  the  measurements  of  its 

capacitance.  Later  on,  ECs  were  used  to  analyze  the  electrical  breakdown  of  biological  membranes.   This  effect  is 

used  nowadays  in  various  medical  applications,  such  as  targeted  drug  delivery.  The  EC  model  was  also  helpful  in 

studies of  “microscopic capacitors” – electric double layers in various electrified interfaces (of which the electrode/ 

electrolyte interface is the most common example). This comparatively simple model, the analysis of which requires 

only  high-school  physics,  has  a  close  relationship  to  some  real-life  problems  in  physics,  chemistry  and  biology. 

We  will  be  examining  a  version  of  an  EC  model,  which  is  a  parallel-plate  capacitor  with  an  elastically  suspended 

upper plate   and a lower plate, which is fixed and grounded (Fig. 1).  The separation between the uncharged plates is 

h0, the area of each plate is A, and the effective “spring constant” is KA (K is the spring constant per unit area). As it is 
usually assumed, the distance h between the plates is much smaller than A1/2 and the fringe effects can be neglected.  

Building up charge on the plates causes the spring to stretch, until the attractive electric force and its opposing elastic 

force  become  equal,  and  an  equilibrium  position  is  established.    The  mathematical  development  that  follows  will 

describe  the  equilibrium  position  of  the  plates  and  the  electrical  parameters  of  the  EC,  and  will  deal  with  possible 

instabilities  in  the EC. The relationships that result from this seemingly simple electro-mechanical system are quite 

interesting,  and  afford  one  an  opportunity  to  better  understand  the  underlying  physical  processes.    I hope that both 

teachers and students will find this discussion instructive and challenging.

Statement of the Problem

To study the electric properties of an isolated EC, the charge 

Q

 on the upper plate is incremented by small portions 

 
∆ Q

.  Every time a 

Q∆

 is added, the new value of charge stays fixed (this is what we mean by isolated) while h and 

V  assume  new  equilibrium  values  corresponding  to  the  new  value  of 

Q .  Now,  students  may  be  challenged  by 

following questions:

the  gap  from  further  contraction?                                                                                                                                        

Suggestion: try casting the problem in dimensionless units, such as 

z

h=

. 

The energy of the isolated elastic capacitor (per unit area) consists of elastic and electrostatic contributions.  

where 

σ =

/Q A

 is the charge density and εis the dielectric constant in the gap of EC Orienting the x-axis 

as the upward normal to the grounded plate, we find the resultant force (per unit area) acting on the top plate,

where the first term is the elastic force caused by the stretched spring, and the second term is the opposite force due to 

the electrostatic attraction of the plates. Note that the weight of the plate does not appear in Eqs. (1) and (2) because it 

is fixed and compensated by the elastic force. The potential difference between the plates is

At  small  charges  (

)  EC  behaves  similarly  to  a  regular  (fixed)  capacitor  (described  in  Fig.  2  by  v

potential is practically a linear function of the charge. However, as s grows,

Students  can  verify  these  “critical”  values    either  numerically  (using  Eq.  7)  ,  or  by  finding  the  maximum  from  the 

differential condition

 becomes the descending function of charge. In other words, an 

s

,

increase of electric charge on the plates is accompanied by a decrease of the potential drop across the capacitor  1  

This  unusual  feature  becomes  even  more  remarkable  when  described  in  terms  of  (dimensionless)  differential 

capacitance 2 per unit area, 

dC

 where 

s∆ s is a small variation of charge density and 

v∆

 is a corresponding 

                                                 
1    To  better  understand  this  unusual  behavior,  a  kinematical  analogy  may  be  useful.  As  you  know,  an  automobile 
moving with constant velocity v covers a distance L= v t in time t. Suppose that you  drive  a "super car" that can run 
as fast as you wish, and your final goal is to cover a maximum distance. However, in order to make your life more 
difficult,  a restriction is imposed. The higher the velocity you chose, the shorter becomes the time you are allowed to 
move. In fact, the time is explicitly described as a descending function of v: t = t0 (1 - 0.5 v2), where t0 is a given 
constants.  Try  to  find  the  optimal  velocity  v=vmax  by  drawing  the  function  L=  v  t(v)  and  finding  at  what  v=vmax  it 
reaches maximum. You will discover that vmax=  1/3
. After this problem is solved, note that it exactly relates to the 
z(s):  the  reduction  of  time  depending  on  v  is  analogous  to  the 
EC  problem  through  the  substitution  v
→
contraction of the capacitor gap depending on charge. 
2 When the properties of a capacitor depend on its charge (or Voltage), the differential capacitance becomes a far more 
appropriate tool than the regular (integral) capacitance, 
  (total charge by total Voltage). In a sense, using 
C
v )  velocity  to  describe  an 
/dv ds 

instead  of  v/s  is  similar  to  using  the  instantaneous  (v)  rather  than  the  average  (

.  As 

s   approaches 

crs , 

dC → ∞

  .  Note,  that  in  a  fixed  capacitor  C  

d

becomes infinite only in the limit

z →

0

. In contrary, in an elastic capacitor at the point 

s

s=
cr

 where 

dC    becomes 

infinite, gap width 

z

is finite (

z =

2 / 3

). The most intriguing consequence of our equations, however, is that  C

d s  
( )

becomes negative for  s

s>
cr

.   

This  unusual  feature  also  appears  in  studies  of  various  elaborate  models  of  the  “microscopic  capacitors”  (electrical 

double layers). As in ECs, it is generally caused by some sort of electro-compression, although the role of a spring is 

usually played by a combination of molecular, electrostatic and “entopic” forces [1]. The discussion of these effects 

and reality behind them might be a topic for a student’s physics project.  

Suggestions for further study 
 

 

 

 

 1.  We did not answer the question about the influence of a stop inserted in the gap of the EC.  This question might be 

offered for independent study.  

2.  Our  analysis  was  based  on  the  equilibrium  condition 

f = .  It  is  always  a  good  idea  to  verify  if  a  discovered 

0

equilibrium is stable.  This is equivalent to the requirement that the upper plate resides in a minimum of the energy 

curve  W z , not in a maximum. If the contrary were true, then all our previous results including the anomalies of  C    

( )

d

would  become  invalid.  The  students  can  be  asked  to  depict  the  dependencies 

ECw for  at  least  three  characteristic 

values  of  charge, 

s

s

=

s
cr

  and 

s

s>
cr

  corresponding  respectively  to  the  regions  with 

dC

>

0,

C

d =

∞

  and 

dC <

0

. They will find that each curve has a single minimum, which means that the equilibrium is stable. 

3.  The EC model that we used does not cover one very important feature of membranes or double layers. In reality, 

their “plates” are not rigid. For example, a membrane’s flexibility allows a lateral variation of 

h

 and a corresponding 

local  variation  of  charge  density 

σ

  (needed  to  maintain  the  “conductive  plates”  as  equipotentials).  How  can  such 

flexibility alter our results? Once again, the EC can be helpful in answering this question [1].  

The simplest example, is to use two identical ECs connected in parallel. It turns out that in a range of charges where 

the  capacitance  of  a  “rigid  plate”  EC  would  become  negative,  the  “flexible  plate”  EC  (modeled  by  two  ECs  in 

parallel)   loses its stability. Such instabilities and “phase transitions” in membranes and charged interfaces are well 

known, very important and widely studied. 

4.  The  charge-controlled  conditions  discussed  in  this  chapter  are  very  rare  in  the  studies  of  real  microscopic 

capacitors, such as electrical double layers and membranes. It is much more practical to connect the electrodes of a 

measuring cell to a potential source (battery) so that voltage  V (not the charge) is under control.  The students could 

                                                                                                                                                                
accelerated  motion.  Obviously,  instantaneous  (“differential”)  characteristics  provide  much  more  complete  and 
 one would 
unambiguous information about the system than its averaged properties. For instance, knowing that

be challenged to study the EC’s properties in such an “extended” system. Particularly, they can be asked to analyze 

how the EC’s stability depends on V .  These questions are discussed below. See also Ref. [2], the problem 25-62.

2. The Elastic Capacitor under Potential Control 

We now consider the EC connected to a battery, when the potential difference V is controlled. In such an  “extended” 

system,  charge  can  be  exchanged  between  the  EC  and  the  battery.  Using  equations  (2)  and  (3),  the  electric  force.

force  is  attractive.  The  energy  of  charging  an  EC  connected  to  the  battery  is  W

properties of the extended system, we use the dimensionless units of Eq. 4. The last two equations in (5) should be 

replaced respectively by the equations and 

f

. It is worth noting that the equilibrium distance derived 

from the condition 

f =

0 

can still be represented using Eq. 6. Only now, instead of being an independent variable, the 

equilibrium  charge  density,  s,  must  be  expressed  through  v  using  Eq.  7: 

s

.  They  can  be  found 

graphically  as  the  s-coordinates  of  the  intersection  points  between  a  horizontal 

v

  and  the  curve 

( ) 
v s

described by Eq. 7. Fig 2 shows that there are two distinct regions of potential:                                                                         

(a)  for  any 

v <

  there  are  two  equilibrium  solutions  (e.g.,  points  a  and  b  shown  for  v  =  v3  );                

 

 

 

(b)  for  v

crv>

  no  such  intersections  exist,  and  the  expanded  system  does  not  have  any  equilibrium  state.  

The  critical  potential,  v

cr,  separates  these  two  regions.  Now  it  is  appropriate  to  ask  which  of  the  two  equilibrium 

solutions, sa or sb, should be chosen.  In other words, which one corresponds to a stable equilibrium?  To answer this 

question we can study the profiles wexpand(z) for different values of v, keeping in mind that the equilibrium values of z 
are related to the equilibrium values of s through Eq. 7 (z=1-s2/2).  Several such profiles are shown in Fig, 3. On curve 

1 (v=0), there is a distinct minimum at z=1. As the potential increases, the minimum shifts towards a smaller z. This 

minimum, shown as za on curve 3, corresponds to sa, the smaller of two equilibrium charge densities shown in Fig. 2. 

The maximum of the N-shaped profile, zb, corresponds to sb of Fig. 2.  This finding actually answers our question: the 

equilibrium  corresponding  to  the  solution  s=  sb  (Fig.  2)  is  unstable.    In  other  words,  the  range  of  charges  that 

corresponds to the equilibrium of the expanded system is s < scr. In this range of charge C is positive.   

Therefore we should conclude that the differential capacitance under V -control is strictly positive. This result, which 

we  obtained  specifically  for  the  EC  model,  is  in  fact  universal  and  applicable  to  all  sorts  of  capacitors,  both 

macroscopic and microscopic. 

At critical potential (curve 4) the equilibrium disappears. Larger voltage leads to the collapse of the elastic capacitor.  

This phenomenon is closely related to the breakdown of the biological and artificial membranes. 

Let us now estimate a breakdown voltage for a typical lipid membrane. The equilibrium thickness of the lipid bilayer 
(the  basic  component  of  the  membranes)  is  h0  ~2.5  nm,  its  effective  elastic  constant  K~10-11  N/nm,  and  dielectric 

constant

This  value  correctly  represents  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the  membrane  breakdown  voltage,  although  the 

experimental values are typically 2-3 times lower. To explain those differences would require a much more elaborate 

model of the membrane which is beyond the scope of this paper [1]. 

 Finally,  it  should  be  noticed  that  the  electric  breakdown  described  above    is  similar,  but  not  identical  to  a 

phenomenon  widely  know  as  “dielectric  breakdown”  [2],  where  a  material  loses  its  insulating  properties  when  a 
sufficiently strong electric field (exceeding the “dielectric strength” of the material) is applied 3.

3 It is interesting to notice that some microscopic capacitors can hold electric fields far exceeding the typical 
“dielectric strength” values for insulators.  For example, the charge density in contacts of metal electrodes with 
electrolytes (liquid or solid) can reach 10-20 µC/cm2, which corresponds to electric field strength F~109 V/m existing 
at microscopic distances (~1 nm) near the interface. Note that the highest dielectric strengths of macroscopic materials 
can hardly reach 1/10 of this value.

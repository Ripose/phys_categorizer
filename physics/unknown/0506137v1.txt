Abstract 

This paper investigates the dynamics of stocks in the S&P500 index for the last 30 
years. Using a stochastic geometry technique, we investigate the evolution of the market 
space and define a new measure for that purpose, which is a robust index of the dynamics 
of the market structure and provides information on the intensity and the sectoral impact 
of the crises. With this measure, we analyze the effects of  some extreme  phenomena on 
the  geometry  of  the  market.  Nine  crashes  between  1987  and  2001  are  compared  by 
looking  at  the  way  they  modify  the  shape  of  the  manifold  that  describes  the  S&P500 
market space. These crises are identified as (a) structural, (b) general and (c) local. 

Keywords:  financial  markets,  stochastic  geometry,  complexity,  market  spaces,  market 
structures.

1 Introduction 
 
In  a  previous  contribution  [1]  we  developed  a  method  for  the  reconstruction  of  an 
economic  space.  By  using  a  metric  related  to  returns  correlation  and  a  stochastic 
geometry  technique,  we  proved  that  economic  spaces  are  low-dimensional  entities  and 
that this low-dimensionality is caused by the small proportion of systematic information 
present in correlations among stocks. Using our reconstruction method we found that part 
of  the  correlation  contribution  is  virtually  indistinguishable  from  random  data.  We  also 
found  that  a  topological  index,  the  coefficient  of  clustering,  captures  maximal 
information  on  market  synchronization,  displaying  a  completely  different  behavior 
depending on the occurrence of bubbles or crashes. However, synchronization just relates 
to distance.  

In the present paper, we investigated the hypothesis that market spaces uniformly 
contract  during  crashes  along  their  effective  dimensions  and  concluded  that,  otherwise, 
some crashes may act differently on specific directions, causing interesting changes in the 
shape of the market space. In order to capture that distortion effect, the evolution of the 
market space is verified as it is reconstructed under a moving window over an interval of 
16  days.  A  structure  index  is  then  used  to  compute  the  lack  of  uniformity  among  the 

 

 

 

2 

market effective dimensions. As a consequence, we are able to characterize the structures 
that  emerge  in  relevant  historical  periods  and  to  identify  the  economic  sectors  that  are 
associated to important changes in the leading directions of the evolving market space. 

It  is  empirically  observed  that  both  during  expansion  and  normal  periods  the 
market  tends  toward  randomness  whereas  in  the  disturbed  periods  its  structure  is 
reinforced, not only in the topological sense (as revealed by the clustering measures) but 
also in the geometrical sense, considering distortions of form. From this observation we 
propose  a  new  measure  of  the  dynamics  of  the  market  structure,  which  captures  that 
distortion effect in the shape of the market space. 

Some  other  authors  also  discussed  the  existence  of  a  dynamic  pattern  during 
market's crashes ([2],[3] and [4]) or have tried to identify economic sectors as clusters of 
assets with a similar economic dynamics ([5] and [6]). In reference [5], Gopikrishnan et 
al.  used  techniques  that  are  related  to  the  metric  we  use,  although  with  a  different 
perspective.  Diagonalizing  the  correlation  matrix,  they  have  tried  to  identify  particular 
eigenvectors  with  the  traditional  industrial  sectors.  In  our  analysis  the  effective 
dimensions of a market space may not correspond to economic sectors. We argue that the 
lack  of  uniformity  among  the  effective  dimensions  reveals  the  existence  of  a  dynamic 
pattern (which we empirically verify that correspond to crashes). To evaluate the impact 
of  those  extreme  phenomena  in  different  economic  sectors  (and  the  sectoral  dynamics 
among different crashes), we compute the index of market structure for different market 
spaces, each of them comprising stocks that belong to a specific economic sector. 

In sections 2 and 3 the method is explained in detail and it is applied to a set of 
companies that are or have been in the S&P500 index. In section 4 we discuss the results 
obtained  for  specific  sectors  and  the  role  of  those  sectors  in  some  important  market 
crashes. Finally, a summary and conclusions are presented. 

 

2 Method 
 
The idea is simply stated in the following terms: 

1)  Pick a representative set of N stocks and their historical data of returns over some 

2)  Using  an  appropriate  metric,  compute  the  matrix  of  distances  between  the  N 

time interval.  

stocks.  

3)  From  the  matrix  of  distances  compute  the  coordinates  for  the  N  stocks  in  an 

Euclidean space of dimension D ≤ N-1. 

4)  Apply the standard analysis of reduction of the coordinates to the center of mass 

and compute the eigenvectors of the inertial tensor. 

5)  Apply the same technique to random data with the same mean and variance.  
6)  Compare  the  eigenvalues  in  (4)  with  those  in  (5)  and  identify  the  directions  for 
which the eigenvalues are significantly different as being the market characteristic 
dimensions. 

7)  From  the  eigenvalues  of  order  smaller  than  the  number  of  characteristic 
dimensions, compute the difference between eigenvalues in (4) with those in (5). 
The  normalized  sum  of  those  differences  is  the  index  S,  which  measures  the 
evolution of the distortion effect in the shape of the market space.

 (2) 
 

For  both  random  and  actual  data,  the  sorted  eigenvalues,  from  large  to  small,  decrease 
with their order. In the random case, the amount of decrease is linear in the order number, 
proving that the directions are being extracted from a spherical configuration. The display 
of a uniform and smooth decrease in the values of the sorted eigenvalues is characteristic 
of random cases and is also experimentally observed when the market space is built from 
historical data corresponding to a period of business as usual. 

Considering for the lack of uniformity among the market effective dimensions we 
are able to characterize the extent to which crashes act differently on specific directions, 
causing changes in the shape of the market space. Looking for relevant distortions in the 
shape of the S&P500 market space through the last 30 years, we found that amongst the 
highest values of the index are those computed in some important dates, as 19th October 
1987, 11th September 2001 and 27th October 1997.  

In  addition  to  the  geometrical  analysis  of  the  whole  S&P500  market  space,  our 
measure  is  applied  to  sets  of  stocks  that  belong  to  specific  economic  sectors.  Results 
show  that  some  crashes  act  differently  on  specific  sectors  and  that  the  deviation  from 
random  behavior  may  be  limited  to  a  few  days  after  the  day  of  the  crash  and  also  to  a 
small  number  of  sector-oriented  groups  of  stocks.  Accordingly  to  these  characteristics, 
crises are identified as (a) structural, (b) general and (c) local.

Given  that  set  of  distances  between  points,  the  question  now  is  reduced  to  an 
embedding problem: one asks what is the smallest manifold that contains the set. If the

proportion of systematic information present in correlations between stocks is small, then 
the  corresponding  manifold  will  be  a  low-dimensional  entity.  The  following  stochastic 
geometry technique was used for this purpose.

is  diagonalized  to  obtain  the  set  of  normalized  eigenvectors  {

i e,λ }.  The  eigenvectors 

i

ie define  the  characteristic  directions  of  the  set  of  stocks.  The  characteristic  directions 
correspond  to  the  eigenvalues  ( iλ)  that  are  clearly  different  from  those  obtained  from 
random  data.  They  define  a  reduced  subspace  of  dimension  d,  which  carries  the 
systematic information related to the market correlated structure [1]. 
 

3.2 Index of the market structure 
 
Since the largest d eigenvalues define the effective dimensionality of the economic space, 
we compute S as:

where  λt(1),  λt(2), ...,  λt(d)  are  the  largest  d  eigenvalues  of  the  market  space  and  λ'(1), 
λ'(2), ... λ'(d) are the largest d eigenvalues obtained from random data over the same time 
window and with the same mean and variance. 

Vilela  Mendes  proposed  in  [8]  an  index  that  quantifies  the  effect  of  some 
structure-generating mechanisms in dynamical models, based on the fact that a structure 
in  a  collective  system  acquires  a  characteristic  length  larger  than  that  of  the  individual 
components  of  the  system.  We  develop  this  strategy  for  the  definition  of  our  structure 
index S: as the dynamics of systems develop a structure-generating mechanism, the index 
S measures the normalized difference between the characteristic length of those structures 

 

 

5 

and  the  characteristic  length  of  the  individual  components  of  the  system.  This  is  a 
geometrical approach to define and to measure emergence. 

In  portfolio  optimization  models,  when  the  systematic  and  unsystematic 
contributions  to  the  portfolio  risk  are  distinguished,  the  former  is  associated  to  the 
correlation between stocks (collective structure) and the later to the individual variances 
of each stock [1]. Consequently, when S is applied to the market space, the eigenvalues 
obtained  in  the  random  case  (λ'(i))  may  be  taken  as  reference  values  that  represent  the 
characteristic  length  with  which  each  leading  direction  contributes  to  the  shape  of  a 
market  whose  components  were  correlated  at  random.  These  eigenvalues  correspond  to 
the  characteristic  length  of  the  individual  (isolated)  components  of  the  market.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  eigenvalues  obtained  from  actual  data  λt(i)  represent  the  characteristic 
length of each structure emerging from the dynamics of the market, that is, associated to 
each leading directions of the market space.  
 
4 Results and Discussion 
 
Results were computed in relation to actual daily returns data as well as to random data 
with the same mean and variance.  
 
4.1 The S&P500 effective dimensions 
 
The first set of actual data consists in 249 stocks present in S&P500 from July 1973 to 
March 2003, considering all the surviving firms for the whole period. Part of the ordered 
eigenvalue  distributions  obtained  from  actual  data  and  from  random  data  is  shown  in

The plots in Fig.1 represent the largest 25 eigenvalues obtained for the first set of 
actual  data.  The  largest  25  eigenvalues  are  compared  to  the  largest  25  eigenvalues 
obtained  from  random  data.  Given  the  decrease  obtained  from  the  7th  eigenvalue,  we 
conclude  that  the  market  structure  is  essentially  confined  to  a  6-dimensional  subspace. 
This proves that this subspace captures the structure of the deterministic correlations that 
are driving the market and that the remainder of the market space may be considered, for 
the current purpose, as being generated by random fluctuations.  

To  test  the  robustness  of  this  conclusion,  we  have  divided  the  data  in  two 
chronologically  successive  batches  (the  first  consisting  in  daily  data  from  July  1973  to 
March 1988, while the second batch includes data from March 1988 to March 2003) and 
performed  the  same  operations.  In  spite  of  the  changes  in  the  market  through  time,  in 
both cases the behavior of the eigenvalues distribution is very much the same. Apart from 
statistical  fluctuations,  the  reconstructed  spaces  exhibit  a  reasonable  degree  of  stability, 
confirming that the number of characteristic dimensions of the S&P500 market space is 
six. 

Considering this result, our analysis of the S&P500 market shape is based on 6-
dimensional subspaces. The question now is to assess the extent to which the occurrence 
of extreme phenomena modifies the shape of this subspace and the pattern of behavior of 
firms and sectors. 
 
4.2 The dynamics of crashes 
 
As  extreme  phenomena  are  dated  events  and  as  we  look  for  their  consequences  in  the 
distributions  of  the  6  leading  directions,  the  geometry  of  the  historical  data  is  defined 
considering short periods. In this sense, instead of the large time intervals that defined the 
reconstruction  of  the  S&P500  space  as  in  [1],  we  adopted  a  16-days  window  as  the 
chosen time interval and computed the index of structure with the time window centered 
at  several  different  dates.  The  plots  in  Figure  2  show  some  of  these  dates,  namely  the 
crashes of 19th October 1987, the Black Monday, 11th September 2001 and 27th October 
1997,  the  Second  Black  Monday.  The  second  plot  in  this  figure  shows  an  unimportant 
date:  May  6,  1997,  as  suggested  in  reference  [9],  was  a  typical  normal  day  in  the  US 
stock market.  

The plots in figure 2 show λ(i) (with i=1,…,6) obtained from the S&P500 market 
space at four different dates. It is obvious that the values of S obtained for the first and 
the  second  Black  Mondays  and  for  11th  September  2001  are  high,  as  there  is  a  great 
difference  in  the  decrease  of  the  first  6  eigenvalues  computed  from  actual  and  random 
data.  On  the  contrary,  when  the  same  calculation  is  performed  around  a  typical  normal 
date, the results show that, comparing actual data with random data, there is a quite small 
difference  in  the  decrease  of  the  first  6  eigenvalues,  which  is  still  another  piece  of 
evidence for the robustness of our method. The geometrical changes in the shape of the 
market  space  describe  the  structural  evolution  of  the  characteristic  dimensions.  As 
previously  indicated,  the  normal  periods  qualitatively  tend  to  randomness  while  the 
disturbed periods will tend away from randomness.

A  less  detailed  but  more  extensive  result  is  presented  in  Fig.3,  where  the  plot 
shows the daily values of S for the 30 years period. We used a time moving window of 16 
days  on  a  market  space  including  the  249  stocks,  i.e.  all  firms  surviving  through  the 
whole period. The eight highest values of S are marked on the plot.   

The highest peaks are identified and correspond to the following crashes: 

 

1.  October 1987 
2.  October 1989 
3.  October 1997 
4.  October 1998 

5.  April 1999

The  ranking  of  the  crashes  according  to  the  measure  of  S  and  its  explanation  is  as 
follows: 
 

1.  October 1987: Black Monday. 
2.  December 2000-Jan.2001: Argentinean Financial crisis (Argentina and Turkey

Figure 3: the evolution of the index S, measuring the evolution of the S&P500 structure 

It  is  quite  obvious  from  Fig  3  that  we  have  two  periods  of  crises,  clustering  in 
1987-1989  and  in  1997-2001:  the  nature  of  these  periods  is  discussed  below.  It  should 
also be considered that some of the events in the list refer to crises in emergent market 
countries, with considerable effects on the dynamics of the world economy; others refer 
to  the  effect  of  different  factors.    Indeed,  the  nature  of  the  triggering  factors  widely 
varies. The 1987 crash is well researched and corresponds to a major malfunctioning of 
the financial system. As Wright points out [10], the Dow Jones suffered a major loss of 
22,61%  the  19th  October  1987,  whereas  the  losses  were  12,82%  the  28th  October  1929 
and 11,73% the 29th. Considering the 55 days around the trough, the cumulated loss was 
of 39,6% in 1929 and of 36,1% in 1987.  

Having identified the events corresponding to the eight highest values (peaks) of S 
in  the  last  30  years  (Fig.3),  we  reconsidered  our  data  investigating  the  periods  around 
each peak. Besides providing a more accurate view of the evolution, it allows for a better 
measurement  since  at  each  window  we  consider  a  larger  number  of  companies  in  the

the US stock market.

Considering shorter spans of time, we could include larger sets of stocks for each 
period;  consequently,  all  the  entrant  firms  at  each  period  can  be  taken  into  our  picture. 
This procedure highlighted the importance of another crash, which was previously hidden 
by our selection of the thirty years’ survivors. In fact, when the window used for scanning 
through our data is 40 days, the highest peaks (SMax= max{St}  ti ≤ t ≤ ti+40 ) organize in 
the following order (Table 1):

Unsurprisingly, the highest peak corresponds to the Black Monday, being not only 
the larger one but also the long-lasting crisis. The most interesting change in the ranking 
of crashes concerns the appearance of the NASDAQ collapse in April 2000, which was 
hidden  by  the  fact  that some  emerging  firms  in  the  nineties  were  not considered  in  our 
previous data set since they did not exist for the whole (30 years) period. Yet, when they 
are considered, the real picture of a turbulent market appears very clearly: it was in the 
Information Technology and Telecommunication sector that most speculation and stock 
activity  concentrated  in  the  late  nineties,  during  the  Internet  bubble,  and  the  NASDAQ 
crash  marks  its  end.  This  crash  proves  the  dimension  of  this  speculative  process.  The 
NASDAQ  attained  its  highest  peak  by  early  March  2000,  and  then  its  all-time  highest 
loss by April (35% of loss in relation to the peak the previous month). 

The different crises are compared in the next figures (Figs.5 and 6). They classify 
in three groups: (a) a structural crisis, (b) general crises, and (c) local crises. Local crises 
are  shorter  and  less  intense  (6  to  9  in  our  ranking),  general  crises  are  longer  and  more 
intense (2 to 5 in our ranking), whereas a structural crisis (1 in our ranking) is deeper and 
more prolonged. According to the values obtained by SMax, local crises attain maxima of 
around 6, general crises from 7 to 15, and the structural crisis more than 30 (Fig.4). 

A  second  criterion  for  the  distinction  among  these  types  of  crises  is  the  rate  of 
decay  of  the  values  of  SMax.  For  the  cases  of  local  crises,  these  values  decrease  rather 
quickly  after  the  peak  (plus  the  16-days  moving  window),  proving  that  the  structure-
generating behavior is short living after the days of the crash.

Figure 6: General crises 
 

A third characteristic distinguishing between local and general crises is presented 
in  the  next  section,  where  sectoral  dynamics  is  taken  into  account.  Local  crises  tend  to 
concentrate in some specific sectors; in contrast, general crises tend to exhibit a pattern of 
perturbation in all sectors (as Fig. 9 shows). 
 
4.3 Compared sectoral dynamics 
 
When,  instead  of  the  whole  set  of  stocks,  we  consider  sub-sets  including  the  stocks  of 
firms belonging to the same economic sector 1 and compute the index of market structure 
for each of these sub-sets, evidence for some interesting properties emerges.  

In a previous paper and using several topological indexes [1], we verified that in 
periods  of  expansion,  sector-oriented  sub-sets  are  characterized  by  a  smaller  average 
distance  between  stocks.  The  average  behavior  of  companies  belonging  to  the  same 
economic sector is more synchronous than the behavior of the overall market taken as a 
whole: in the  jungle of the crisis, tribes of firms act together.  Now we  analyze sectoral 
dynamics  by  considering  the  consequences  of  crashes  on  the  leading  directions  of  nine 
sector-oriented  market  spaces,  being  each  of  them  restricted  to  stocks  in  one  of  the 
following  sectors:  Energy,  Materials,  Industry,  Consumer  Discretionary,  Consumer 
Staples, Health Care, Financials, Information Technology and Utilities.

(GICS®), available at  http://www.standardandpoors.com/, referenced in June, 2005.

In  Figs.7  to  9,  the  histograms  show  the  value  of  SMax  obtained  from  those  nine 
different market spaces, all of them built on the same time period, which is indicated in 
the  title  of  the  plots.  The  results  show  the  remarkable  impact  of  the  Asian  crisis  in  the 
Financial sector and the strong effect of the attack to the Twin Towers on the Materials 
and Industrial sectors. 

Again,  there  is  an  obvious  difference  between  what  we  classify  as  local  and  as 
general  crises.  A  third  characteristic  distinguishing  between  local  and  general  crises  is 
obvious  from  the  graphs.  Local  crises  tend  to  concentrate  in  some  specific  sectors 
(financial  companies  for  the  Asian  Crash,  industrial,  materials  and  financial  companies 
for  the  case  of  the  reaction  to  the  11th  September).  In  contrast,  general  crises  tend  to 
exhibit a pattern of perturbation in all sectors (as Fig. 9 shows).

The plot in Fig.9 shows the extraordinarily unique character of the 1987 Black Monday: 
this is the only case of a crash provoking a similar dynamics in all major sectors, whereas 
in all other crises the dynamics and time pattern of the main sectors is clearly divergent.

Finally, we compare the sectoral dynamics among different crashes, taking the examples 
of Materials and Financials. Because in the Black Monday crisis the index S reaches very 
high values in all sectors, this crisis was intentionally excluded from the plots in Fig.10.

Table 2: description of the sectors dominating each crash 

 
From  the  above  results,  one  notices  that  the  Financials  sector  is  the  sector  that  most 
frequently  appears  as  a  leading  sector.  Its  appearance  as  the  leading  sector  of  both  the 
Argentinean and the Asian crises is in accordance with the appropriate expectations, since 
each  of  these  crises  corresponds  to  a  major  malfunctioning  of  the  financial  system. 
Another  encouraging  result  refers  to  the  Information  Technology  leadership  at  the 
NASDAQ crisis, settling the end of the Internet Bubble of the second half of the nineties. 
Back  to  the  geometrical  tale  of  our  index,  a  3  dimensional  look  at  the  market 
space that evolves from October 1989 to September 2001 and comprises on average 80 
Financial stocks (the lower plot in Fig.10), would reveal a manifold that: (i) starts from a 
elliptical  form  (in  1989),  (ii)  acquires  prominences  in  a  particular  direction  at  the  1997 
Asian  Crash,  and  (iii)  turns  back  to  a  close-to-spherical  form  until  the  Argentinean 
Financial  crisis  in  December  2000.  After  a  partial  shape  recovery,  a  new  relevant 
distortion will arrive in September, 2001.  

A  smoother  dynamics  characterizes  the  market  space  built  from  stocks  in  the 
Materials  sector  along  the  same  time  period  (1989  to  2001).  Accordingly  to  the  results 
presented  above  (the  upper  plot  in  Fig.10),  the  only  relevant  shape  distortion  of  that 
market space is the one taking place in 11th September, 2001; when the structure index S 
reaches a value three times higher than the highest value obtained so far for the Materials 
market space. 
 
4 Conclusions 
 
A  stochastic  geometry  technique  proved  to  be  useful  for  the  purpose  of  describing  and 
interpreting  the  evolution  and  changes  in  the  dynamics  of  a  market.  Furthermore,  the 
index S, as defined in this paper, allowed for a useful taxonomy of the nine major stock 
market  crises  occurring  in  the  last  thirty  years.  Three  types  of  crises  were  considered: 
local,  general  and  structural  crises.  We  classified  these  crashes  according  to  the 
maximum  values  of  S,  but  three  other  operative  criteria  were  useful  to  describe  these 
differences: (1) the decay time of the effects of the crash is reduced in the case of local 
crises; (2) general crises concentrate on several sectors; (3) the structural crisis involves 
all  sectors  under  a  similar  time  pattern.  The  measure  of  SMax  proved  to  be  useful  and 
capable  of  discriminating  among  the  distinct  processes  at  work  in  the  stock  market.

As  the  index  S  captures  the  lack  of  uniformity  among  the  market  effective 
 
dimensions,  we  are  able  to  characterize  the  extent  to  which  crashes  act  differently  on 
specific  directions,  causing  changes  in  the  shape  of  the  market  space.  Looking  for 
relevant distortions in the shape of the S&P500 market space through the last 30 years, 
we  identified  the  events  corresponding  to  crises  in  emergent  market  countries,  with 
considerable effects on the dynamics of the world economy. Others events that were also 
identified refer to the effect of different factors, showing that, the nature of the triggering 
factors widely varies. 
The  identification  of  the  characteristics  of  each  crisis  allows  for  their 
 
differentiation.  Local  crises  were  imposed  either  by  disarrangements  of  national  stock 
markets from emerging economies (Russia, Asia) and global players (Japan) or by purely 
exogenous factors (the 11th September attack). The crash provoked by exogenous factors  
is less consequential and is rapidly superseded. Instead, general crises followed another 
pattern: they are deeper, longer and involve a large number of sectors. The Argentinean 
crises  (December  2000-January  2001)  and  the  following  NASDAQ  crisis  (April  2000) 
and the US recession (April 2001) initiated or followed the end of the Internet Bubble of 
the second half of the nineties.  

Finally,  the  Black  Monday  (1987)  was  the  deeper  and  the  longest  of  all  the 
crashes  as  well  as  the  more  general,  since  it  involved  all  economic  sectors.  The  data 
suggest  that  another  structural  crisis  may  be  at  work  in  the  clustering  of  six  crashes 
between April 1997 and September 2001.

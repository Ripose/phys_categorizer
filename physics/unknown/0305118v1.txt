Abstract. 

An expression is derived for the free energy of nonideal atomic plasma, which 
corresponds to exact asymptotic expansions. The analytical dependence of correction 
for  the  interaction  of  free  charges  on  the  partition  function  of  atom  is  found.  It  is 
demonstrated  that  the  consistent  inclusion  of  the  contribution  by  excited  atomic 
states  to  the  thermodynamic  functions  of  nonideal  atomic  plasma  brings  about  a 
significant  modification  of  the  conventionally  employed  equation  of  state  and 
equation of ionization equilibrium. 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 

We  will  treat  an  atomic  hydrogen-like  plasma  consisting  of  Ne electrons,  Ni 
ions, and  Na atoms and located in a volume  V at a temperature  T. Assuming that the 
gas of atoms is ideal, and the free charges weakly interact with one another, the free 
energy F of the system being treated has the form:

k
aS   is the internal partition function 
wavelength of a particle of the sort  k  (k=e,i,a); 
of  atom,  and  e  -  is  the  base  of  natural  logarithm.  The  last  term  in  Eq.  (1)  is  the 
correction to the free energy of an ideal-gas mixture, caused by the interaction of free 
electrons  and  ions  with  one  another.  This  correction may be conveniently expressed 
in  terms  of  the  appropriate  quantity  FD   related  to  temperature  and  unit  charge. 
Equation  (1)  describes  a  system  of  charges  in  a  fairly  wide  range  of  pressures  and 
temperatures,  from  an  ideal  gas  of atoms to a fully ionized weakly nonideal plasma. 
This equation serves a basis for the so-called "chemical model" of plasma [1] within 
which  most  of  concrete  calculations  by  the  equations  of  state  and  composition  of 
plasma  are  performed  and  which  allows  a generalization to a composite plasma [2]. 
Note,  however,  that  no  unified  generally  accepted  method  exists  for  the  notation  of 
free  energy  for  a  nonideal  atomic  plasma  [3].  This  indeterminacy  is  due  to  the  fact 
that  different  expressions  are  used  in  the  literature for the finite convergent partition

aS ,  as  well  as  different  expressions  for  the  correction  for  the 
function  of  atom 
interaction of free charges  FD . Therefore, one can speak of the presence of a double 
indeterminacy  for  the  free  energy  of  atomic  plasma  of  the  form  of  Eq.  (1).  This 
indeterminacy  results  in  numerous  versions  of  the  "chemical  model"  [4]  which 
produce  substantially  different  results  in  the  calculation  of  equations  of  state  and 
composition  of  plasma. Comparison with the results of experiments performed for a 
plasma  of  inert  gases  and  vapors  of  alkali  metals  [5]  only  proves  the  existence  of  a 
problem in this case. A surprisingly good agreement with experiment is demonstrated 
by  the  ideal-gas  approximation  ( FD =0)  even  under  conditions  of  a  marked 
Coulomb  nonideality  [6].  Neither  is  it  possible,  within  some  single  version  of  the 
"chemical  model"  (1)  to  describe  the  experimental  data  using  both  the  thermal  and 
caloric equations of state [7]. 

The  same  range  of  states  of  atomic  plasma,  i.e.,  from  atomic  gas  to  fully 
ionized  weakly  nonideal  plasma,  allows  the  description  within  the  "physical  model". 
The  main  results  from  the  use  of  this  latter  model  were  obtained  in  [8-10]. In this 
case,  treatment  is  performed  in  the  grand  canonical  ensemble  by  the  methods  of 
quantum  statistics.  For  the  grand  thermodynamic  potential 
  and  total 
concentration  of  nuclei  n,  expansions  with  respect 
to  degrees  of  activity 
  and  (gk  è  mk  –  denote the statistical weight and chemical potential 
z

of  particles  of  the  sort  k,  respectively)  were  obtained  up  to  terms  of  the  order  of

an accuracy of up to terms of the order of z2, and do not contain quantum corrections 
of  the  order  of  lec.  These  simplifications,  while  placing  no  restrictions  on  the 
generality  of  our  inferences,  make  it  possible  to  appreciably  simplify  subsequent 
computations.  At  high  temperatures,  equation  of  state  (2),  (3)  describes  the  fully 
ionized  plasma  (bP=2n),  and,  at  lower  temperatures,  the  atomic  gas  (bP=n). The 
distinguishing feature of relations (2) and (3) is the fact that their use does not require 
the solution of the problem (that is traditional for the "chemical model") of the choice 
of  the  atomic  partition  function.  This  is  quite  natural,  because,  in  deriving  Eqs.  (2) 
and  (3),  we  consistently  treated  the  contribution  made  to  thermodynamics  by  the 
states of both discrete and continuous spectra of different sign with regard for their 
screening.  Therefore,  in  contrast  to  Eq.  (1),  relations  (2)  and  (3)  do  not  exhibit 
indeterminacy. 

We demonstrate the existence of a class of models in which the free energy of 
atomic  weakly  nonideal  plasma  given  by  Eq.  (1)  exactly  corresponds  to  the 
asymptotic expansions given by Eqs. (2) and (3). This reduces the problem of double 
indeterminacy  of  the  "chemical  model"  to  the  choice  of  only  the  atomic  partition 
function.  We  will  follow  Volokitin  and  Kalitkin  [11]  and  conventionally  divide  the 
methods  of  calculation  of  the  atomic  partition  function  used  in  the  literature  into 
three  groups,  namely,  the  calculation  by  formula  (4),  the  application  of  the  nearest 
neighbor approximation (NNA) (classed with this may be the use of the concepts of 
critical  microfield  [12],  confluence  of  lines,  etc.),  and  the  calculation  of  the  atomic 
partition  function  with  regard  for  all  states  for  which  the  binding  energy  of  electron 
exceeds in magnitude the Debye energy of charge in the plasma. In accordance with 
the  inferences  of  Volokitin  and  Kalitkin  [11]  that  it  is  the  second  approach  (i.e., 
NNA)  that  best  corresponds  to  the  actually  observed  radiation  spectra  of  atomic 
plasma,  we  can  derive  a  unique  (in  a  sense)  and  quite  valid  expression  for  the  free 
energy of nonideal atomic plasma. 
 

1.  TRANSITION  FROM  THE  "CHEMICAL"  TO  "PHYSICAL"  MODEL. 
We  will  use  expression  (1)  for  the  free  energy  of  nonideal  atomic  plasma  in  the 
general form and make a transition from the small to grand canonical ensemble. The 
expression  relating  the  free  energy  F and the grand thermodynamic potential  W has 
the form:

In  deriving  Eqs.  (6)  -  (8),  it  was  assumed  that  the  correction  FD   was  a

function  of  only  the  dimensionless  plasma  parameter 
. 
This  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  the  Coulomb  potential  has  no  characteristic  spatial 
scale.

We  will  further  assume  for  simplicity  that  the  atomic  partition  function 
symmetrically  depends  on  the  concentrations of free electrons and ions, because all

methods of restriction of the atomic partition function on the free energy and on all

When  used  in  expression  (1)  with  the  appropriate  atomic  partition  functions, 
relations  (31)  -  (33)  define  the  sought  class  of  expressions  for  the  free  energy  of 
nonideal atomic plasma that correspond to exact asymptotic expansions (2) and (3). 
The  first  term  of  the  correction  for  NNA  (32)  fully  corresponds  to  that  previously 
obtained  in  [13].  The  Planck--Larkin  partition  function  gives  a  conventional  Debye 
correction to the free energy according to Eq. (31). However, as was demonstrated in 
[11], the number of levels realized in this case does not correspond to the number of 
experimentally  observed  spectral  lines.  In  addition,  the  populations  of  levels, 
especially of highly excited ones, are not Boltzmann populations. In our opinion, the 
most preferable option of partition function corresponds to the NNA: in this case, the

correction  to  the  free energy remains proportional to the plasma parameter  G , but 
with  a  different  numerical  coefficient.  The  physical  reasons  for  this  result  will  be 
discussed  below.  The  third  option  of  partition  function  turns  out  to  be  completely 
  limit  changes 
inadequate,  because  the  correction  to  the  free  energy  in  the 
sign, which implies the predominance of repulsion in the interaction of free charges.

AND  ANALYSIS  OF  THE  RESULTS. In order to derive the equation of state and 
decrease  in  the  ionization  potential,  one  must  find  an  analytical  expression  for  the 
term in Eqs. (10) and (16) that contains the partition function derivative,

The  resultant  relations  (41)  and  (42)  demonstrate  that  the  consistent  inclusion 
of  excited  states  in  determining  the  free  energy  of  nonideal  atomic  plasma  and  the 
equations  of  state  and  ionization  equilibrium  leads  to  results  which  significantly 
differ  from  conventional  results  (see  the  factor  with  the  plasma  parameter).  So,  the 
linear  term  of  the  correction  to  the  pressure  became  significantly  (by  a  factor  of 
almost  25)  less  than  the  Debye  correction.  The  decrease  in  the  ionization  potential 
behaves  similarly.  Figures  1--3  illustrate  the  behavior  of  corrections  to  the  free 
energy,  pressure,  and  decrease  in  the  ionization  potential  depending  on  G  for three 
options of the "chemical model" treated by us, which differ from one another by the 
choice  of  partition  function.  The  NNA  option,  which  apparently  must  be  preferred, 
demonstrates  a  significant  weakening  of  the  nonideality  effects  in  the  case  of 
consistent  inclusion  of  the  contribution  by  excited  states.  The  first  terms  of 
expansions  in  Eqs.  (41)  and  (42)  were  obtained  previously  within  a  different 
approach [13]. 

The  first  Debye  correction  to  the  thermodynamic  functions  of  a  fully  ionized 

plasma is virial by its nature,

and the range of its validity is quite narrow. It turns out that, rather than being caused 
by  the  attraction  of  free  charges,  as it was traditionally assumed, the decrease in the 
ideal-gas  pressure  described  by  this  correction  is  due  to  the  formation  of  highly 
excited, essentially classical, atoms; naturally, this is a result of attraction as well. In 
Eq. (43),  n  is  the  total  concentration  of  charges.  A  perfectly  analogous  situation  is 
observed in the case of atomic gas which allows the formation of bound states, i.e., 
molecules. In this case, the use of correction calculated in terms of the second virial 
coefficient  is  likewise  characterized by a very narrow range of validity and describes 
the  pressure  decrease  due  to  both  the  attraction  of  atoms  and  the  formation  of

molecules.  It  is  apparent  that  the  extrapolation  of  virial  corrections  in  systems  in 
which  two-particle  bound  states  are  formed  will  never  be  capable  of  describing  the 
pressure decrease by a factor of exactly two upon transition of atomic gas into purely 
molecular one. 

For  atomic-molecular  systems,  this  problem  was  solved  by  Hill  [14]  who 
demonstrated  that,  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  interaction  of  free  atoms  not 
bound into molecules, one must extract from the total virial coefficient its part which 
corresponds  to  the  bound  states,  with  the  bound  states  proper  being  taken  into 
account  in  the  form  of  a  separate  component.  The  remaining  part  of  the  virial 
coefficient corresponds to the interaction of free atoms. 

It proved difficult to directly apply this approach to plasma, because all virial 
coefficients  in  Coulomb  systems  diverge.  The  derivation  of  the  convergent  result 
given by Eqs. (2) and (3), which actually implies the calculation of the second group 
coefficient for the plasma, involves the compensation of contributions by the discrete 
and  continuous  spectra  in  a  system  of  like  charges.  It  was  as  a  result  of  this 
compensation  that  the  Planck--Larkin  partition  function  appeared  in  the  final 
expressions,  this  partition  function  corresponding  to  the  convergent  part  of  the 
second  group  coefficient  proportional  to  the  square  of  concentration.  Note  that  the 
Planck--Larkin  partition  function  bears  no  relation  to  the  actual  atomic  partition 
function.  We  have  in  fact  extracted  the  contribution  by  highly  excited  bound  states 
from the virial expansion for a hydrogen plasma. 

Consider a hypothetical case of the presence in the plasma of only the excited 
*
aDS  in Eq. (26). In this case, Eq. (15) of 
an  corresponding to the second term

Structure  (48)  makes  it  possible  to  trace  the  role  of  excited  states  in  plasma. 
The formation of bound excited states due to the factor K shows up in three ways. In 
addition to the apparent decrease in the number of charges (the factor 1  - K) and the 
emergence  of  the  second  term  associated  with  the  contribution  by  the  ideal  gas  of 
excited atoms, the Debye correction decreases (the term  K/2 in the second factor of 
the  first  term).  The  latter  occurrence  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  calculation  of  the 
Debye  correction  involves  a  partial  inclusion  of  the  part  of  the  phase  space  of  the 
electron-ion  pair  that  corresponds  to  negative  energies  of  relative  motion,  i.e.,  to 
excited atomic states. 

ﬁG

Therefore,  the  range  of  validity  of  expression  (43)  may  be  significantly 
extended  by  way  of  preliminary  introduction  of  the  representation  of  excited  atoms 
even  for  a  formally  fully  ionized  plasma,  because  excited  atoms  represent  neutral 
particles.  It  was  the  inclusion  of  this  factor  that  resulted  in  a  decrease  in  the 
conventional Debye corrections. The contribution by excited atoms turns out to be of 
the  same  order  as  the  contribution  by  Debye  correlations.  Therefore,  we  reach  an 
unexpected conclusion that a plasma exhibiting a marked nonideality is always partly 
ionized even at high temperatures. The treatment of a fully ionized plasma is possible 
  limit.  When  the  Planck  -  Larkin  partition  function  is  used  in 
only  in  the 
aDS , contribution 
calculations, the highly excited bound states corresponding to the 
relate  to  the  charged  component  of  atomic  plasma,  i.e.,  the  kinetic  and  internal 
energies of these states relate to the charged subsystem. Generally speaking, one can 
calculate the equation of state the way it is shown above. It is obvious, however, that 
the  thus  calculated  composition  of  atomic  plasma  will  be  characterized  by 
overestimated  concentrations  of  free  charges.  In  addition,  a  nonphysical  loss  of 
stability will arise  in this case in the equations of state and ionization equilibrium due 
to  a  significant  overestimation  of  the  energy  of  free  charge  interaction  with  plasma. 
In  our  opinion,  this  fact  calls  for  a  certain  refinement  of  predictions  concerning  the

CONCLUSION 

We have derived a class of expressions for the free energy of nonideal atomic 
plasma  ("chemical  model"),  which  agree  with  asymptotic  expansions.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that, for the physically most valid option (NNA), the corrections to the 
thermodynamic  functions  do  not  correspond  to  the  Debye  approximation.  The 
contribution  by  highly  excited  atomic  states  to  the  thermodynamics  of  nonideal 
atomic  plasma  was  analyzed.  Analytical  expressions  have  been  derived  for 
corrections  to  the  equations  of  state  and  ionization  equilibrium,  which  are 
characterized by a wider range of validity compared to conventional expressions.

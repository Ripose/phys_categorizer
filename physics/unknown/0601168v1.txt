Abstract 

 

 

In the paper two car collinear collisions are discussed using Newton's law of mechanics, 

conservation  of  energy  and  linear  constitutive law  connecting  impact  force  and  crush. 

Two  ways  of  calculating  the  mutual  restitution  coefficient  are  given:  one  already 

discussed by other authors that does not include the car's stiffness and a new one based 

on car stiffness. A numerical example of an actual test is provided. 

1. Introduction 

For the modeling of the collinear car collision two methods are usually used. The first is 

the  so-called  impulse-momentum  method  based  on  classical  Poisson  impact  theory, 

which replaces the forces with the impulses ([3], [9]). The second method treats a car as 

a  deformable  body;  so  the  constitutive  law  connecting  contact  force  with  crush  is 

necessary.  For  the  compression  phase  of  impact  the  linear  model  of  force  is  usually 

adopted and the models differ in the way the restitution phase of collision is treated ([5], 

[11], [12], [14]). 

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  extend  the  linear  force  model  discussed  in  [1]  to  the 

collinear  impact  of  two  cars.  In  the  quoted  article  it  is  proposed  that  a  car  is 

characterized  by  its  mass,  stiffness  and  limit  velocity  for  permanent  crush.  The  latter 

properties can be established by a fixed barrier crush test. Also, the proposed restitution 

model  is  simple:  rebound  velocity  is  constant.  The  question  arises  as  to  how  these

characteristics  can  be  incorporated  into  the  two  car  collision  model  since  it  is  well 

known that the mutual coefficient of restitution is the characteristic of impact; i.e., it is a 

two car system and not the property of an individual car ([2], [14]).   

To  answer  the  above  question,  first  the  well-known  theory  of  central  impact  is 

specialized for collinear car collisions. The kinetic energy losses are then discussed and 

the restitution coefficient is related to them. The third section of the paper discusses two 

models  for  calculating  the  mutual  restitution  coefficient  based  on  individual  car 

characteristics.  The  last  section  is  devoted  to  a  description  of  the  use  of  the  present 

theory in accident reconstruction practice. The section ends with a numerical example.  

2. Two car collinear collision 

Consider a collinear impact between two cars where collinear impact refers to rear-end 

and  head-on  collisions.  Before  impact  the  cars  have  velocities 

1v   and 

2v   respectively 

and after impact they have velocities  1u  and 

2u  (Figure 1).

follows 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the collision phase the movement of cars is governed by Newton's 2nd and 3rd laws 

(Figure 2). On the basis of these laws equations of motion of the cars can be written as

where 

1m  and 

2m  are the masses of the cars and F is contact force.

Following  Poisson's  hypothesis  ([13]),  the  impact  is  divided  into  two  phases: 

compression and restitution. In the compression phase the contact force F raises and the 

cars are deformed. The compression phase terminates when the relative velocity of cars 

vanishes;  i.e.,  when  cars  have  equal  velocity  (Figure  1).    The  compression  phase  (1) 

thus integrates the changes from initial velocities to common velocity u. This leads to 

the following system of equations

In the restitution phase the elastic part of internal energy is released.  Equations (1) are 

integrated from u to the end velocities, which gives two equations for three unknowns

system  (5)  for  an  unknown's  post-impact  velocity  and  restitution  impulse  the 

constitutive  equation  is  needed.  According  to  the  Poisson  hypothesis  the  restitution 

impulse is proportional to compression impulse  

P eP=
r
c

 

(6) 

where  e  is  the  restitution  coefficient.    Because  contact  force  is  non-negative,  so  are 

compression and restitution impulse.  From (6) this implies that 

0e ≥ . 

Note.  Instead  of  (6),  one  can  use  Newton's  kinematical  definition  of  restitution 

coefficient

which is in the case of centric impact without friction equivalent to Poisson’s definition. 

However in the case of non-centric impact with friction Newton's model could lead to 
overall energy increase  ([10]).

velocities if pre-impact velocities are known, masses of cars are known and, in addition, 

the restitution coefficient is known.  

3. Energy consideration 

At car impact the kinetic energy is dissipated. Applying the principle of conservation of 

energy one obtains, after compression, 

where 

mEΔ

 is maximal kinetic energy lost (or maximal energy absorbed by crush).  By 

using (3) one has

Similarly,  by  applying  the  principle  of  conservation  of  energy  to  the  overall  impact 

one finds the well known formula for total kinetic energy lost (see for example [9])

relating the mutual coefficient of restitution e with the restitution coefficients obtained 

for individual cars in the fixed barrier test.  

4. The mutual coefficient of restitution 

Let 

1Tv  be a barrier test velocity of a first car and 

2Tv  a barrier test velocity of a second 

car.  Let these velocities be such that the maximal kinetic energy lost can be written as

The mutual restitution coefficient is therefore from (13), (14) and (15), by using (10),

where 

01v  and 

02v  are limited impact velocities where all the crush is recoverable ([1]). 

The task is now to determine appropriate test velocities of cars which satisfy (14). 

Let 

1Tv  be the barrier test velocity (or barrier equivalent velocity [6]) of the first car for 

the same crush as in a two car impact and 

2Tv  the barrier test velocity for the same crush 

for the second car. Then the test velocities for the same crush must satisfy relations ([1],

(25) 

This  equation  for  the  calculation  of  e  has  (to  the  author’s  knowledge)  not  yet  been 

published.  Knowing  the  mass  and  stiffness  of  the  cars  and 

vΔ   one  can  calculate  test 

velocities  from  (24),  restitution  of  individual  cars  from  (17),  the  mutual  restitution 

coefficient from (25) and post-impact velocities from (8). 

4. 2 Model B. 

This  model  does  not  include  cars’  stiffness  and  it's  based  on  (10)  and  (14)  only. 

Equating (10) and  (14) results in the equation  

for two unknowns. To solve it one could set

Note  that  in  calculation  of  restitution  coefficients  (17)  the  absolute  values  of  test 

velocities  should  be  used.  Substituting  (29)  into  (16)  gives  the  mutual  restitution

This  formula  was  derived  by  different  arguments  of  Howard  et  al  ([7])  and  is  also 

quoted by Watts et al ([15]).  

4.3 Compartment of the models 

Comparing  (24)  and  (25)  one  finds  that  test  velocities  of  both  models  are  the  same  if 

stiffness  is  proportional  to  the  mass;  i.e., 

k
1

k m=
0
1

  and 

k

2

k m=
0
2

  where 

0k   is  a 

constant. 

While the test velocities of the models differ, the mutual restitution coefficient differs 

only in the case when just one car is crushed permanently, since 

(cid:131)   when 

Tv

1

v≤

01

  and   

Tv

2

v≤

02

  then  both 

e

e=

(cid:131)  when 

Tv

1

v>

01

 and  

Tv

2

v>

02

 then substituting (17) and appropriate test velocities 

into  (25) or (30), and taking (10) into account, yields 

1e =  and

11

Note that (31) can not be used directly for calculating the mutual restitution coefficient 

in  advance  since  the  classification  of  impact--fully  elastic,  fully  plastic  or  mixed--

depends on test velocities.   

At last the question arises as to which model is more physically justified. While Model 

A has a sound physical base connecting test velocities with crushes, Model B requires 

some  additional  analysis.  It  turns  out  that  it  can  be  interpreted  as  follows.  The 

compression  impulse  (4),  can  be  written  by  using  (23)1  as   

cP m v

= Δ .  Using  (2)  one 

could  define  test  velocities  of  individual  cars  as  velocities  resulting  at  the  end  of  the 

compression  phase  in  a  fixed  barrier  test  as  the  same  impulse  as  in  an  actual  two  car 

collision; i.e.,  

 

P m v m v

Δ =

(32) 

From this equation, test velocities given already by (29) result. Now by (6) restitution 

impulse 

is 

P eP e m v

so 

by

and

one  must 

have

Δ =

.  But  this  can  be  fulfilled  only  in  the  special  case  when 

e

e=

, and consequently, by (30), when 

e

e= . This consequence raises a doubt about 

1

Model B’s adequacy for general use. 

4.4  Examples 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  above  formulas  were  implemented  into the  spreadsheet  program  (Table  1).As  the 

example, a full scale test (test no. 7) reported by Cipriani et al ([4]) was executed.  In 

this test the bullet car made impact with the rear of the target car at a velocity of 5 m/s 

or 18 km/h. The mass of the cars and their stiffness was taken from the report; however, 

the limit speed was taken to be 4 km/h for both cars ([1]). The result of the calculation is 

shown  in  Table  2.  The  calculated  velocity  difference  for  the  target  car  is  14.8  km/h, 

which differs from that measured (3.9 m/s or 14.0 km/h) by about 5%. The calculated 

velocity  change  for  the  bullet  car  is  11.3  km/h  and  the  measured  one  was  2.9  m/s  or 

10.4 km/h. The discrepancy is thus about 7%. If one takes the limit speed to be 3 km/h, 

1/21/2006 
 
 

12

then  the  calculated  value  of  velocity  change  for  the  bullet  car  is  13.6  km/h,  differing 

from  that  measured  by  about  2%,  and  the  calculated  value  of  velocity  change  for  the 

target car is 10.4, which actually matches the measured value.

5. Accident Reconstruction 

In a real car accident the problem is not to determine post-impact velocities but usually 

the  opposite;  i.e.,  to  calculate  the  pre-impact  velocities.  For  determining  pre-impact 

velocities,  however,  the  post-impact  velocities  determined  from  skid-marks  should  be 

known. If only the permanent crushes of cars are known then only the velocity changes 

for  individual  cars  in  an  accident  can  be  calculated.    If  the  characteristics  of  cars  are 

known--i.e.,  mass,  stiffness  and  limit  velocity--then  the  problem  is  solved  as  follows. 

Let 

1rδ  be residual crush of the first vehicle. The maximal crush, then, is ([1])

The  above  formulas  were  programmed  into  a  spreadsheet  program  (Table  2).  As  the 

example, the car to car test described by Kerkhoff et al ([8]) is considered. In this test 

the test car (bullet) struck the rear of the stationary car (target) at a speed of 40.6 mph or 

65  km/h.  The  actual  measured  vΔ   was  22.6  mph  or  36.2  km/h.  As  can  be  seen  from 

Table 2, the calculated value 

1vΔ  for the bullet car is 36.1 km/h; i.e., the discrepancy 

between  actual  and  calculated  value  is  0.2%  and  the  calculated  impact  velocity  64.14 

km/h differs from the actual by 1.3 %. Note that the deformation of the stationary car 

was not reported, so (34) is used for calculation of its maximal dynamic crush. The limit 

speed for both cars was taken to be 4 km/h ([1]). The discrepancy of calculated values 

in  the  previous  case  is  so  minimal  because  the  actual  low  impact  velocity  tests  were 

used for determination of stiffness. If one used for the calculation the default values of 

CRASH  stiffness  and  appropriate  calculated  limit  velocity  for  class  1  cars  the 

discrepancy would increase (Table 4). Thus, in this case the calculated velocity change 

of the bullet car is 38.5 km/h, which differs from the actual change by about 6% and the 

calculated   vΔ  is 52.2 km/h, differing by about 20%.

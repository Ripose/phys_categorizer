We determine the volcano climate sensitivity λ and response time τ for the 

Mount Pinatubo eruption. This is achieved using observational measurements of 

the temperature anomalies of the lower troposphere and the aerosol optical 

density (AOD) in combination with a radiative forcing proxy for AOD.  Using 
standard linear response theory we find λ = 0.18 ± 0.04 K/(W/m2), which implies 

a negative feedback of  −1.0 ± 0.4.  The intrinsic response time is τ = 5.8±1.0 

months.  Both results are contrary to the conventional paradigm that includes long 

response times and positive feedback.  In addition, we analyze the outgoing 

longwave radiation during the Pinatubo eruption and find that its time dependence 

follows the forcing much more closely than the temperature, and even has an 

amplitude equal to that of the AOD proxy.  This finding is independent of the 

response time and feedback results.

1. Introduction 

scenario are:   

climate system;  

One of the primary objectives of climatology is to determine how the 

various forcings affect the climate of Earth. The essential elements of the climate 

1)  A forcing ∆F [solar, CO2, CH4, ENSO, volcanoes, etc.] disturbs the 

2)  The temperature T of the earth changes by ∆T with a response time τ;  

3)  The magnitude of the response is determined by a sensitivity λ ; 

4)  The forcing ∆F may have an associated feedback process resulting in a 

gain g which is a factor in λ.  The gain g can be greater than or less than unity, 

depending on the sign of the feedback. 

The Pinatubo volcano climate event (June 15, 1991) dominated all other 

forcings during the time of its occurrence. As Hansen et al. (1992) said:  this 

dramatic climate event had the potential to “…[exceed] the accumulated forcing 

due to all anthropogenic greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere since the 

industrial revolution began”… and should “provide an acid test for global climate 

models.”  The temperature of the earth decreased by 0.5 C and the outgoing long 
wave flux decreased by 2.5 W/m2. We present a new analysis with no adjustable 

parameters based upon observational data and one theoretical result (volcano 
forcing) that yields the values of the climate parameter λ = 0.18 ± 0.06 K/(W/m2).  

This implies negative feedback of  −1.6  (+0.7, −1.6), and an intrinsic response 

time τ = 5.8±1.0 months.  These values are quite different from those that have 

been assumed or found by previous investigators.  We suggest that the reason is 

that they assumed, either explicitly or implicitly [see, e. g., Lindzen and

Giannitsis, 1998], that climate relaxation times are long compared to the relevant 

volcano time scales, an assumption that we do not make and which can be seen to 

be inconsistent with the observed climate response.   

The forcing ∆F(t) is defined in terms of an equivalent change in net 

 
irradiance (in W/m2) referred to the top of the atmosphere [Shine et al., 1995].  

This forcing causes a change in the mean temperature of Earth.  It is assumed that 

this formalism applies to ∆F(t) and ∆T(t) as global averages.  Climate models 

concentrate on predicting a sensitivity parameter λ that connects these quantities,  

∆T (t) = λ∆F(t) , 

(1) 

for very slow variations in forcing (“steady state”) [Shine et al., 1995].  When the 

system is not in steady state there is a response time τ  introducing a delay 

between ∆F(t) and ∆T(t).  Energy balance models incorporating such a response 

time have been used for many years [e. g., North et al., 1981], with the dynamics 

expressed in the form 

Douglass et al. (2004a) [6] have shown the connection of Eq. (2) to a two-level 

atmosphere model in the case of solar forcing and in the presence of explicit (but 

unspecified) feedback f.  The result can be expressed as 

τ

+ ∆T = λ∆F .

where λ0 is an intrinsic (no-feedback) sensitivity and the gain and feedback are 

related by

in the usual way [Peixoto and Oort, 1992, pp. 26-29].  In work in progress we 

show that feedbacks associated with short-term atmospheric phenomena are 

essentially decoupled from surface-to-deep-ocean processes, and that the effect of 

the latter can be regarded as an effective small correction to the feedback. 

2.  Data 

have shown that 

We consider three data sets that clearly show the Pinatubo influence.  

Aerosol optical density (AOD).   The AOD index (dimensionless) is 

generally accepted as the proxy for volcano climate forcing.  Hansen et al. [2002] 

∆F = A ⋅ AOD , 

(5) 
 
where A = −21 W/m2.  This value of A is the latest estimate by the Hansen group.  
There are several prior estimates that have been as high as −30 W/m2.  We 
arbitrarily assign an uncertainty of ± 0.4 W/m2.  The most recent determination of 

AOD is by Ammann et al. (2003). 

 

Temperature anomalies.  We use the global monthly satellite Microwave 

Sounding Unit lower troposphere temperature (TLT) anomaly data set [Christy et 

al., 2000] that begins in 1979.  Douglass et al. [2002, 2004b] have used TLT to 

determine the solar sensitivity in a multiple regression analysis using solar 

irradiance, El Niño, and AOD as predictor variables.  That analysis produced the 

relation 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

– 5 – 
 

∆(TLT) = k ⋅ ∆(AOD) , 

 

(6) 

with k = −2.9 ± 0.2 K/AOD and a delay of 8 months.  In addition a modified TLT 

data set was produced with El Niño and solar effects removed.  We designate this 

as TLTm.  Our reported analysis will be based on TLTm with occasional 

comparisons to analysis based on TLT. 

 

Long wave radiation (LW).  The outgoing long wave (LW) radiation data 

are from Minnis [1994].  The LW fluxes were determined from irradiance 

measurements from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment and are referenced to 

monthly means from 1985 through 1989.  It is noted that the measurements are 

confined to those made between latitudes 40° N and 40° S, comprising 77% of 

Earth’s surface.  We assume that the radiation outside of this band will not 

seriously change the average flux values reported. 

Figure 1(a) shows plots of TLT, TLTm, LW and AOD for the period 1979 

to 2003.  The LW data cover only 1985 through May 1993, the duration of those 

measurements.  Figure 1(b) shows an expanded plot from 1991 to 1994 

emphasizing the period of the Pinatubo volcanic event. 

3.  Analysis 

The Pinatubo eruption produced aerosols that reflected solar radiation 

away from Earth, causing a general change in the energy balance.  These events 

were quantified in the aerosol optical density (AOD) and longwave emission 

(LW) data sets, respectively.  Since ∆T clearly lags ∆F, it is reasonable to apply 

the straightforward linear response theory represented by Eq. (2).  We use the 

– 6 –

is 

  

time dependence of AOD to obtain a solution of this equation, assuming with 

Hansen that ∆F is proportional to AOD: 

∆F = − Aq(t) , 

where q(t) is a function that closely fits the AOD data, 

  q(t) = 0.439(t / tV )exp(−t / tV )

.    

The time t is in years measured from 1991.42 and tV is the time that AOD reaches 

its maximum, in our case 0.63 yr = 7.6 mo.  The function q(t) is compared with 

AOD in Figure 2. 

The exact analytic solution of Eq. (2) with the forcing given by Eqs. (7,8)

where λA and τ  will be determined by fitting to the ∆T data set TLTm.  By least-

squares analysis we obtain a best fit with τ = 0.47 yr and λA = 3.72.  The fit is 

shown in Figure 3.  The few points near t = 0 and many at t > 6tV lie far outside 

the predicted value.  When we omit these points we find no change in the values 

of τ and λA.  Fitting to TLT, we find τ = 0.50 yr and λA = 1.97.  Using the value 

of A determined by Hansen et al. [2002], we obtain values of the sensitivity λ as 

derived from the two data sets: λ = 0.18 (TLTm) and 0.094 (TLT).   These 

incorporate the “direct” value of A and are shown in the first column of Table 2.  

The close agreement of the relaxation times provides a measure of the accuracy of 

our dynamical fit.   

– 7 – 
 

 

We have also found the solution of Eq. (2) numerically from the AOD 

data itself.  In the critical region of 0-3 years, the two methods agree with each 

other closely, having an rms difference of 1.2% of the peak value.   

We now consider the LW emission data.  It is generally expected to follow 

the temperature, but we find it to be quite anomalous in the present case.  The 

three data sets, AOD, temperature, and LW emission, are analyzed by the delayed 

correlation method described by Douglass et al. [2004a, 2004b].  We demonstrate 

the method using the TLT and LW data sets:   

(1)  LW changes from a background level to a large value and returns. 

(2)  TLT does the same but is delayed by a time td. 

(3)  A plot of TLT against LW will show a “Lissajous loop” whose area is 

roughly proportional to the time delay.  This area would be exactly proportional in 

the case of sinusoidal functions.  For the case of the volcano data sets, the peaks 

are of different half-widths and there is only a “quarter cycle” of a sinusoid.  As a 

result only the values near the peaks contribute to a loop.  

(4)  By varying the time lag of one of the variables, LW, one can find the 

time lag that minimizes the area of the loop.  This value of lag determines td and 

also, of interest to us, a linear relation with proportionality constant s between 

TLT and LW.  In practice, the linear fit is done by least squares with the slope and 
the R2 correlation statistic being determined simultaneously.  Figure 4(a) shows 

TLT vs. LW, Figure 4(b) shows TLT vs. AOD, and Figure 4(c) shows LW vs. 

AOD.  The resulting linear relationships are expressed as 

∆(TLT) = s ⋅ ∆(LW) , 

(10) 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

– 8 – 
 

∆(TLT) = k ⋅ ∆(AOD) , 

∆(LW) = ′A ⋅ ∆(AOD) . 

 

(11) 

(12) 

The values of s, k, and A´ and the associated delays are listed in Table 1.  

Remarkably, the determined delay between LW and AOD is observed to be 0 and 

that between LW and TLT is long (6 months), exactly the opposite of what one 

expects.  It is tempting to consider LW as an alternative proxy for the forcing.  

The delays between TLT/TLTm and LW or AOD are thus expected to be the 

same. However, there are four different estimates (Table 1).  The average and 

standard deviation are expressed as td = 6.8±1.5 months. 

The value of A´ as determined by regression, Eq. (12), is as remarkable as 

 
the zero delay between LW and AOD.  Its value is −21 W/m2, identical to the 

theoretical AOD-forcing proxy value A.  When Eqs. (10), (11), and (12) are 

compared, we see that A´  = s/k.   This can be called an indirect value of A, written 

Aind.  From the slopes of Table 1, we find that Aind has the value −16.2 and −17.5, 

in appropriate units, when evaluated from TLTm and TLT, respectively.  These 

values, being close to the directly determined value of A´, reinforce the idea that 

LW may be a proxy for the forcing.  We call Aind = s/k the “indirect” value of A´. 

When these results are combined with the two different values of λA 

determined above, there are four comparable values of the climate sensitivity to 

consider, as shown in Table 2.  The consolidated result is 

λ= (λA)data fit / Aregression = 0.15 ± 0.06  K/(W/m2 )
  

. 

(13) 

– 9 – 
 

 

The numbers refer to the mean and standard deviation of the four values in Table 

2, the latter of which is a measure of the systematic error.  The value λ = 0.18 
K/(W/m2) derived from the TLTm and direct constant A will be taken as the 

preferred result of this research.  Finally, our  estimate of the uncertainty in A (see 
sec. 2) results in λ = 0.18 ± 0.04 K/(W/m2). 

4.  Results and discussion 

Gain and feedback.  The conventional value of sensitivity for global 

average quantities with radiative forcing and no feedback is the Stefan-Boltzmann 
value λSB = 0.30 K/(W/m2) [Kiehl, 1992].  One of the present authors has recently 

shown [Knox, 2004] that the surface-to-atmosphere non-radiative flux makes a 

correction to the Stefan-Boltzmann result: 

λ0 =

1
1 − γ

λSB , 

where γ is proportional to the non-radiative flux and has a typical value 0.16.  The 

non-radiative correction is not a feedback effect, so λ0 is still properly described 

as the no-feedback sensitivity, and its value is 20% higher than λSB, or 0.36 
C/(W/m2).   

The gain and feedback of the climate system can now be estimated, using 

Eqs. (3,4).  We have 

  g = λ/ λ0 = (0.18 ± 0.04) / 0.36 = 0.5 ± 0.1

. 

Associated with this gain is a negative feedback,  

f = −1.0 ± 0.4 . 

(14) 

(15) 

(16) 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

– 10 – 
 

 

If the gain and feedback are evaluated without the non-radiative correction, a 

similar result is obtained, g = 0.6 ± 0.1, with the feedback again always negative. 

Mechanisms. This work raises the question of the origin of a response time 

as short as several months.  This is just the characteristic time it takes for 

atmospheric disturbance to propagate over the earth.  We conclude that the 

climate event that begins in the atmosphere remains in the atmosphere and that 

there is negligible coupling to the deep ocean.  In addition, we conclude that there 

is no “climate left in the pipeline,” as discussed below. 

 

Since our analysis yields a gain less than unity, a second issue raised is the 

origin of the required negative feedback.  Negative feedback processes have been 

proposed involving cirrus clouds [Lindzen et al., 2001]; and Sassen [1992] reports 

that cirrus clouds were produced during the Mt. Pinatubo event.  The Lindzen et 

al. process involving clouds yields a negative feedback factor of  f = –1.1, which 

is well within the error estimate of the feedback found by us. 

Why has no one come to these conclusions before?  From the 

observations, with no analysis at all, one can estimate  

  ∆T ∆F = ∆T (−21⋅ AOD) = ~ (−0.7) / (−21 × 0.162) = 0.2 ~ λ 

(17) 

and one also sees that the peak of ∆T occurred about 7 months after the peak in 

AOD. This is surprisingly close to the values that our detailed analysis yields.  We 

suggest that this solution was rejected because of a widely held belief in a 

paradigm that assumes that the intrinsic response time is much greater than the 

volcano event time, mathematically, that τ >> tV.  This paradigm also 

includes/induces a belief that positive feedback processes are present.  How can 

 
 

 

 

– 11 – 
 

 

the observation be explained within this paradigm?  In the limit τ >> tV  one sees 

that the solution Eq. (9) becomes  

⎯ →⎯⎯   − 0.439λA ⋅

. 

(18) 

This result has two relevant features.  The first exponential term dominates when t  

> tV, so the tail of the response drops very slowly, with a characteristic time τ, if τ 

is large.   This “memory effect” has often been called climate in the pipeline.  

This is not supported by the Pinatubo data.  Secondly, the factor tV/τ acts as a 

dynamical factor and reduces the peak value.  Now, the above “back of the 

envelope” calculation becomes 

  ∆T ∆F ~ λ⋅ (tV τ) . 

(19) 

(The final factor is there because in this calculation “∆T” refers to the peak 

amplitude, which now contains an effective, smaller λA as seen in Eq. 19.)   So if 

one were to believe that τ ~ 3 to 10 tV, then one would estimate λ ~ 0.5 to 2 and 

infer g > 1 and positive feedback.  Thus one “explains” the observations within 

the paradigm, but on the basis of a solution of the equations that does not take 

account of the forcing shape.  Note that the proportionality between λ and τ 

implied by Eq. (19) is guaranteed only in the limit τ >> tV.  It is not a feature of 

the exact solution, Eq. (9).   

 

In summary, we have shown that Hansen’s hope that the dramatic  

Pinatubo climate event would provide an “acid test” of climate models has been 

achieved, although with an unexpected result.  The effect of the volcano is to 

– 12 – 
 

 

reveal a short atmospheric response time, of the order of several months, leaving 

no climate in the pipeline, and a negative feedback to its forcing.

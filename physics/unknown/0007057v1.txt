ABSTRACT 

 

It is shown by the means of Time-Space Model of Wave Propagation the 

underlying phenomena of the alternating current’s origin in famous Faraday’s experiment. 

 

Keywords: Electromagnetism, Wave Equation

The Time-Space Model of Wave Propagation is applied to the description of 

fluctuation phenomena both in physics and in economics [1, 2, 3]. 

In this paper the Model is applied to the Faraday’s experiment of rotating a 

rectangular conducting loop in a magnetic field [4]. 

Magnetic field represents the energy’s level in the Model terminology. We choose 

two points on the opposite sides of a loop (see Fig. 1) and calculate the induced values of 

energy’s disturbances.

Some other values are also shown on Fig. 1 as side  h  of the loop, distance  l  from 

loop’s center to the “reference plane”, which is perpendicular to the energy’s level 

gradient changes, and an angular speed ω of loop’s rotation. 

Then the distances from 

1x  and 

2x  to the reference plane are

I also assume that the energy’s level at the reference plane is equal everywhere 

 and is distinct from the energy’s level at rest

Therefore we can calculate the energy’s levels in points 

1x  and 

2x  using [1],

where 

0>µ  is some constant. 

 

Thus the energy’s disturbances at points 

1x  and 

2x  are

We can find the difference between the values of energy’s disturbances in points 

1x  and 

2x  respectively,

Changing in time difference between values of the energy’s disturbances causes 

the energy’s disturbance propagation, which is manifested in the form of alternating 

current in the loop.

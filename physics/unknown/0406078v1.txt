Abstract: 
One of the numerous results of the Theory of General Relativity is the appearance of Gravimag-
netism, described already by Thirring and Lense in 1918 [THI 18]. Its understanding normally re-
mains reserved to specialists. 
This article presents a simple classical analogy to bring the description of Gravimagnetism within 
the reach of beginners. The article describes a classical model calculation on the level of under-
graduate students and mentions the situation of the modern experiment. 
 
 
Structure of the article: 
(1.)  Qualitative description of the basics 
(2.)  An analogy between gravitation and electricity 
(3.)   The example of a gyrator in the gravimagnetic field of the earth 
(4.)   References of literature 
 
 
Part 1.:  Qualitative description of the basics 
Regarding  electromagnetic  interaction,  it  is  well  known,  that  it  contains  a  static  an  a  dynamic 
part. The electrostatic component is described by electrical charge according to Coulomb’s law. 
The  electrodynamic  (=electromagnetic)  component  is  described  by  the  use  of  moving  charge 
following Biot- Savart’s law. [ABE 71/81]. We also know the Lorentz- force and Ampere’s law. 
 
The  difference  between  electrostatic  and  electromagnetic  forces  is  merely  a  transformation  of 
coordinates.  This  means,  if  an  electrical  test-  charge  is  moving  exactly  synchronously  with  an 
other  field-  producing  charge,  the  test-  charge  will  only  notice  an  electrostatic  field  but  no 
magnetic one. If the test- charge will move relatively to the field- producing charge, it will remark 
additionally an electromagnetic field and force. 
 
Because the transformation of coordinates is of central importance in electrodynamics same as in 
gravitation,  the  idea  might  arise,  that  the  ambivalence  of  static  and  dynamic  forces  can  be 
transferred from electricity to gravitation. As we will see in the following pages, this is really the 
case. The analogy is illustrated in table 1. On the following pages we will see, that this analogy is 
reaching far enough to describe gravimagnetism.

                  and gravitation 
 
The  calculations  according  to  Coulomb,  Biot-  Savart  and  Newton  are  generally  known  and 
experimentally verified so perfect, that it is even standard for every technician. With Gravimag-
netism,  known  as  Thirring-  Lense-  Effect,  knowledge  behaves  totally  different.  This  effect  is 
known mainly by specialsts and is normally calculated with the means of the theory of General 
Relativity (see for instance [GOE 96] or [SCH 02]). A further problem is also, that this effect can 
hardly be detected, because its forces are extremely small. 
 
Indeed the experimental verification of Gravimagnetism is not acchieved until today. Worldwide 
there  is  nowadays  only  one  experiment  with  a  serious  hope  to  give  results  within  foreseeable 
future. This experiment is known under the name of "Gravity- Probe- B  Experiment" [GPB 04]. 
In order to suppress the influence of gravitostatic forces, it has to be performed in a satellite, and 
it  uses  gyroscopes  with  a  measuring  accuracy  8  orders  of  magnitude  (!)  higher  than  the  best 
gyroscopes in navigation satellites (see [DIT 99]). 
 
An  other  experiment  by  the  European  Space-  Agency  (ESA)  [HYP  00]  is  only  in  the  phase  of 
planning up to now. On the long run, it promisses higher accuracy than the mechanical Gravity- 
Probe-  B  Experiment,  because  it  is  based  on  atomic  beam  interferometry.  But  it  will  still  need 
several years of preparation. 
 
Having  the immense efforts and expenses in mind, which science devotes to the verification of 
Gravimagnetism, we understand two aspects: On the one hand the effect is of very fundamental 
importance for the basic understanding of theory, on the other hand we see, that the experimental 
verification is very difficult. 
 
In order to bring a generally comprehensible explanation of the Thirring- Lense- Effect, we can 
follow  table  1  and  transfer  the  formulas  of  electromagnetism  into  analogous  formulas  of 
gravitomagnetism. This is what we want to do now.

Except for the factors of proportionality (and the fact that the names “mass” and “charge” sound 
different), the formulas of electrostatics and gravitostatics look absolutely identical. So we decide 
to transfer this identity also to the dynamic formulas, as following.

emanates from the charge. We see it in equation 3b.

The only thing still to be done is the determination of the factor of proportionality  (cid:1)  in equ.6. 
Our analogy is also sufficient to do this, as displayed in table 3. The only assumption we need is, 
that the speed of propagation is the same for electromagnetic waves and for gravitational waves – 
namely the speed of light “c”. 
As known, this speed of propagation is equal to the product of the static and the magnetic factors 
of proportionality, as given in equation 7c.

),  we 

anticipate, why the gravimagnetic forces are so small. This can be demonstrated with an example 
as following. 
 
 
Part 3.:  The example of a gyrator in the gravimagnetic field of the earth 
Electromagnetic  forces  can  for  instance  be  measured  between  conductor  loops  with  electrical 
currents. Analogously, gravimagnetic forces  might be detected between  rotating gyroscopes – if 
the measurement is accurate enough. (This is exactly, what the Gravity- Probe- B Experiment is 
trying.) 
In order to maximize the measurable effect, it is sensible to maximize the mass of this gyroscope, 
which produces the gravimagnetic field. The largest available gyroscope for mankind is the earth 
with  its  rotation  (mass 
,  duration  of  one  period  of  rotation  T=86164  sec. 
relatively  to  the  stars).  Consequently  we  decide  to  use  this  earth-  gyroscope  as  source  of  the 
gravimagnetic field for our example and we devide our example into the following two steps: 
 
     - Determination of the gravimagnetic field of the earth 
     - Prediction of the reaction of a test- gyroscope onto the gravimagnetic field of the earth

(3.a) Determination of the gravimagnetic field of the earth 
Therefore we have to solve a threedimensional integral with vectorial integrand. The complicity 
of the integrand makes it necessary to solve the integral numerically by iteration. Thus we have to 
subdivide  the  earth  into  finite  elements  (numbered  with  the  index  “i”)  and  then  follow  the 
equations 5 and 8.

For  each  element  (mass  element 
  is  determined  from 
equation  8  to  be  summed  up  according  to  equation  5  over  the  threedimensional  volume  of  the 
earth.       Please see the following four remarks in connection with this work. 
 
(i.) 

The density of the earth is taken from the so called “Preliminary Reference Earth Model” 
from  geology  and  geophysics  [BUL  85].  The  value  of  the  density  as  a  function  of  the 
distance from the center of the earth is plotted in figure 2.

(ii.) 

 

 

From the calculation can be learned, that the gravimagnetic fieldstrength does not depend 
on the geographical longitude of the position at which the field is calculated. This could 
be expected because of the rotational symmetry of the earth’s movement around the axis 
connecting  the  northpole  and  the  southpole.  By  the  way,  in  this  article  the  degree  of 
latitude  is  used  according  to  the  nomenclature  of  spherical  coordinates  in  mathematics, 
which differs from the nomenclature of geograpghy. (Here we have the northpole at θ=0°, 

6

the equator at θ=90° and the southpole at θ=180°,  see also figure 3). Please keep this in 
mind when later regarding figure 5. 

 

 

    
 
(iii.)  For our calculation it is sufficient to determine the 

(cid:1)
(cid:1)K

vector for one arbitrary moment of 
time,  because  this  vector  is  fixed  rigidely  to  the  sphere  of  the  earth.  The  total 
gravimagnetic  field  of  the  earth  (

This  result  brings  us  into  the  condition  to  calculate  the  example  of  a  gyroscope  within  the 
gravimagnetic field of the earth. 
 
(3.b) The example of a test- gyroscope in the gravimagnetic field of the earth 
In  the  same  way  as  the  electromagnetic  field  of  the  earth  can  be  verified  with  a  compass,  the 
gravimagnetic  field  should  be  verifiable  with  a  gyroscope  –  presuming  the  accuracy  of  the 
measurement is high enough. 
Same as the magnet in a compass can be arbitrarily chosen, the dimensions of the gyroscope can 
be  arbitrarily  chosen  in a way to optimize the technical conditions for a measurement. Here we 
want to chose a gyroscope with a shape optimized for the easiness of comprehensibility and cal-
culation - this is cylindersymmetric flywheel. We chose dimension with easy figures:   
 
 
             
                
 
For our exercise, this is optimum geometry, because it is easy to follow. For the sake of easiness, 
also the position and the orientation of the flywheel shall be especially chosen. The easiest way is 

Radius of the flywheel = 1 m 
Mass of the flywheel = 1000 kg (one metric ton) 
Time for one rotation = 1 millisec. (per each period)

a  flywheel  located  directly  on  the  equator,  because  the  gravimagnetic  field  there  is  exactly  in 
negative y-direction. The orientation of the flywheel’s axis (its angular momentum) is most easy 
(cid:1)
if  parallel  to  the  vector  r
  (this  is  parallel  to  the  x-axis).  All  these  conditions  of  maximum 
easiness lead us to an assembly as shown in figure 6.

For  all  parts  of  the  gyroscope,  the  gravimagnetic  forces  are  orientated  perpendicular  to  C
  (see 
equations 7a and 7b) in analogy with the Lorentz- force. This means, all forces lie within the xz-
plane.  Because  of  this,  all  forces  can  be  summed  up  rather  easy  to  find  out  into  which  type  of 
precession they bring the flywheel. This consideration can be done as following: 
(cid:1)
Because of the cross product of the vectors  v

points of the flywheel (α=90°) they reach zero. This means:

Furthermore the effect of this force (this is the tilting moment onto the gyroscopes axis) decreases 
with the distance of the mass element from the axis. This is simply an effect of the length of the 
mechanical  lever  with  regard  to  each  element  of  the  flywheel.  This  length  of  the  lever  is  the 
flywheel’s  radius  multipied  with  sin(α).  From  there  we  recieve  again  a  factor  of  sin(α),  which 
brings us to equation 13.

This is the calculated frequency of the Thirring- Lense- rotation in our example. 
 
From these figures we now understand how difficult it is to measure such small forces and such 
 
low frequency of precession of such a large gyroscope. The angular frequence of 
can be expressed in milli-angular-seconds per year (=marcsec/yr) to get more handy figures: 278 
marcsec/yr. 
 
In  a  real  experiment,  precondition  for  the  measurement  is  of  course  a  special  bearing  of  the 
gyroscope  in  a way,  that earth brings no (or as little as possible) other forces but gravimagnetic 
forces  onto  the  gyroscope.  For  instance  it  is  necessary  to  avoid  Coriolis-  forces  that  might 
overcome gravimagnetic forces easily by several orders of magnitude. In this aspect, it is useful to 
perform  the  measurement  within  a  satellite,  but  unfortunately  the  frequency  of  the  Thirring- 
(cid:1) ) decreases with the distance from the center of the earth by a third potential 
Lense- Rotation (
law. This means  that the height of the flight of the satellite even decreases the frequency of the 
precession remarkably. Furthermore the path of the real satellite in the Gravity- Probe- B- experi-
ment is not along the equator, but it is a polar trajectory, going along the north- and south- pole, 
which additionally decreases the frequency of presession 
For  the  Gravity-  Probe-  B-  experiment,  the  gyroscope  is  a  sphere  (by  the  way  it  is  the  most 
precise  sphere  manking  ever  produced),  but  not  a  flywheel  as  in  our  example.  From  all  these

details, we expect that the predicted frequence

than  in  our  simple  example.  It  is  only  42  marcsec/yr.  The  final  result  of  the  experiment  can  be 
awaited with eagerness.

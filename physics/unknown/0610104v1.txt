Electronic databases, from phone to emails logs (1, 2, 3, 4), currently provide 
detailed records of human communication patterns, offering novel avenues to 
map  and  explore  the  structure  of  social  and  communication  networks.  Here 
we  examine  the  communication  patterns  of  millions  of  mobile  phone  users, 
allowing  us  to  simultaneously  study  the  local  and  the  global  structure  of  a 
society-wide  communication  network.  We  observe  a  coupling  between 
interaction 
the 
the  network’s 
counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of 
the strong ties, but fall apart following a phase transition if the weak ties are 
removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, 
resulting  in  dynamic  trapping  of  information  in  communities,  and  find  that 
when  it  comes  to  information  diffusion,  weak  and  strong  ties  are  both 
simultaneously ineffective.

Uncovering  the  structure  and  function  of  communication  networks  has  always  been 

constrained by the practical difficulty of mapping out interactions among a large number of 

individuals. Indeed, most of our current understanding of communication and social networks 

(5) is based on questionnaire data, reaching typically a few dozen individuals and relying on 

the individual’s opinion to reveal the nature and the strength of the ties. The fact that currently 

an  increasing  fraction  of  human  interactions  are  recorded  from  email  (1,  2,  3)  to  phone 

records  (4),  offers  unprecedented  opportunities  to  uncover  and  explore  the  large  scale 

characteristics  of  communication  and  social  networks.  Here  we  take  a  first  step  in  this 

direction by exploiting the widespread use of mobile phones to construct a map of a society-

wide  communication  network,  capturing  the  mobile  interaction  patterns  of  millions  of 

individuals.  The  dataset  allows  us  to  explore  the  relationship  between  the  topology  of  the 

network  and  the  tie  strengths  between  individuals,  information  that  was  inaccessible  at  the 

societal  level  before.  We  demonstrate  a  local  coupling  between  tie  strengths  and  network 

topology,  and  show  that  this  coupling  has  important  consequences  for  the  network’s  global 

stability if ties are removed, as well as for the spread of news and ideas within the network.  

A  significant  portion  of  a  country’s  communication  network  was  reconstructed  from  18 

weeks  of  all  mobile  phone  call  records  among  approximately  20%  of  the  country’s  entire 

population,  90%  of  whose  inhabitants  had  a  mobile  phone  subscription  (see  Supporting 

Information).  While  a  single  call  between  two  individuals  during  18  weeks  may  not  carry 

much information, reciprocal calls of long duration between two users serves as a signature of 

some work, family, leisure or service based relationship. Therefore, in order to translate the 

phone log data into a network representation that captures the characteristics of the underlying 

communication  network,  we  connect  two  users  with  an  undirected  link  if  there  has  been  at 

least one reciprocated pair of phone calls between them—i.e., A called B, and B called A—

and define the strength,

w =

AB w

BA

, of a tie as the aggregated duration of calls between users 

A  and  B.  This  procedure  eliminates  a  large  number  of  one-way  calls,  most  of  which 

correspond  to  single  events,  suggesting  that  they  typically  reach  individuals  that  the  caller 

does not know personally. The resulting mobile call graph (MCG) (

4) contains

nodes and

 links, the vast majority (84.1%) of these nodes belonging to a single 

connected  cluster  (giant  component,  GC).  Given  the  very  large  number  of  users  and 

communication  events  in  the  database,  we  find  that  the  statistical  characteristics  of  the 

 

2

network  and  the  GC  are  largely  saturated,  observing  little  difference  between  a  two-  or  a 

three-month  long  sample.  Note  that  the  MCG  captures  only  a  subset  of  all  interactions 

between  individuals,  a  detailed  mapping  of  which  would  require  face-to-face,  email  and 

landline  communications  as  well.  Yet,  while  mobile  phone  data  capture  just  a  slice  of 

communication  among  people,  research  on  media  multiplexity  suggests  that  the  use  of  one 

medium for communication between two people implies communication via other means as 

well (6). Furthermore, in the absence of directory listings, the mobile phone data is skewed 

towards  trusted  interactions  (that  is,  people  tend  to  share  their  mobile  numbers  only  with 

individuals  they  trust).  Therefore,  the  MCG  can  be  used  as  a  proxy  of  the  communication 

network  between  the  users.  It  is  of  sufficient  detail  to  allow  us  to  address  the  large  scale 

features  of 

the  underlying  human  communication  network,  and 

the  major 

trends 

characterizing it. 

The MCG has a skewed degree distribution with a fat tail (Fig. 1A), indicating that while 

most users communicate with only a few individuals, a small minority talk with dozens (4, 7). 

If the tail is approximated by a power law, the exponent γk = 8.4 is significantly higher than 

the value observed for land lines (γ = 2.1 for the in-degree distribution, see Ref. 8). For such a 

rapidly  decaying  degree  distribution  the  hubs  are  few,  and  therefore  many  properties  of 

traditional  scale-free  networks,  from  anomalous  diffusion  (9)  to  error  tolerance  (10)  are 

absent. This is probably rooted in the fact that institutional phone numbers, corresponding to 

the vast majority of large hubs in the case of land lines, are absent, and in contrast with email, 

where a single email can be sent to many recipients, resulting in well-connected hubs (1), a 

mobile phone conversation typically represents a one-to-one communication. The tie strength 

distribution is broad (Fig. 1B), however, decaying with an exponent γw = 1.9, so that while the 

majority of ties correspond to a few minutes of air time, a small fraction of users spend hours 

chatting  with  each  other.  This  is  rather  unexpected,  given  that  fat  tailed  tie  strength 

distributions  have  been  observed  mainly  in  networks  characterized  by  global  transport 

processes,  such  as  the  number  of  passengers  carried  by  the  airline  transportation  network 

(11), the reaction fluxes in metabolic networks (12) or packet transfer on the Internet (13), in 

which  case  the  individual  fluxes  are  determined  by  the  global  network  topology.  An 

important feature of such global flow processes is local conservation: all passengers arriving 

to  an  airport  need  to  be  transported  away;  each  molecule  created  by  a  reaction  needs  to  be 

consumed by some other reaction; or each packet arriving to a router needs to be sent to other 

 

3

routers. While the main purpose of the phone is information transfer between two individuals, 

such local conservation that constrains or drives the tie strengths are largely absent, making 

any relationship between the topology of the MCG and local tie strengths less than obvious. 

Complex networks often organize themselves according to a global efficiency principle, 

meaning that the tie strengths are optimized to maximize the overall flow in the network (13, 

14). In this case the weight of a link should correlate with its betweenness centrality, which is 

proportional to the number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes passing through it (13, 

15,  16,  17).  Another  possiblility  is  that  the  strength  of  a  particular  tie  depends  only  on  the 

nature  of  the  relationship  between  two  individuals,  and  is  thus  independent  of  the  network 

surrounding  the  tie  (dyadic  hypothesis).  Finally,  the  much  studied  strength  of  weak  ties 

hypothesis (18,  19,  20) states that the strength of a tie between A and B increases with the 

overlap  of  their  friendship  circles,  resulting  in  the  importance  of  weak  ties  in  connecting 

communities. This leads to high betweenness centrality for weak links, which can be seen as 

the mirror image of the global efficiency principle. 

In Fig. 2A we show the network in the vicinity of a randomly selected individual, where 

the  link  color  corresponds  to  the  strength  of  each  tie.  It  appears  from  this  figure  that  the 

network  consists  of  small  local  clusters,  typically  grouped  around  a  high  degree  individual. 

Consistent with the strength of weak ties hypothesis, the majority of the strong ties are found 

within the clusters, indicating that users spend most of their on-air time talking to members of 

their immediate circle of friends. In contrast, most links connecting different communities are 

visibly  weaker  than  the  links  within  the  communities.  As  a  point  of  comparison,  when  we 

randomly permute the link strengths among the connected user pairs (Fig. 2B), in what would 

be consistent with the dyadic hypothesis, we observe dramatically more weak ties within the 

communities  and  more  strong  ties  connecting  distinct  communities.  Finally,  even  more 

divergent with the observed data (Fig. 2A), we illustrate what the world would be like if, as 

predicted by the global efficiency principle and betweenness centrality, inter-community ties 

(“bridges”) were strong and intra-community ties (“local roads”) weak (Fig. 2C).  In order to 

quantify the differences observed in Fig. 2 we measure the relative topological overlap of the 

neighborhood  of  two  users

(Fig. 1C).  The  dyadic  hypothesis  implies  the  absence  of  a  relationship  between  the  local 

network topology and weights, and, indeed, we find that permuting randomly the tie strengths 

between the links results in  O

 (Fig. 1D). We find, however, that

, indicating that on average the links with the highest betweenness centrality 

ijb

 

have the smallest overlap. In contrast, for the real communication network 

O  increases as 

w

a  function  of  the  percentage  of  links  with  weights  smaller  than  w,  demonstrating  that  the 

stronger the tie between two users, the more their friends overlap, a correlation that is valid 

for    approximately  95%  of  the  links  (Fig. 2D).  This  result  is  broadly  consistent  with  the 

strength of weak ties hypothesis, offering its first societal-level confirmation. It suggests that 

tie strength is, in part, driven by the network structure in the tie’s immediate vicinity.  This is 

in contrast with a purely dyadic view, according to which the tie strength is determined only 

by the characteristics of the individuals it connects, or the global view, which asserts that tie 

strength is driven by the whole network topology.  

 

To  understand  the  systemic  or  global  implications  of  this  local  relationship  between 

tie strength and network structure, we explore the network’s ability to withstand the removal 

of either strong or weak ties. To evaluate the impact of removing ties, we measure the relative 

size of the giant component

( f

)

, providing the fraction of nodes that can all reach each 

RGC

other through connected paths as a function of the fraction of removed links,

f

. We find that 

removing  in  rank  order  the  weakest  (or  smallest  overlap)  (Fig.  3,  A  and  B)  to  strongest 

(greatest overlap) ties leads to the network’s sudden disintegration at 

8.0=wf

 (

6.0=Of

). 

In contrast, removing first the strongest (or highest overlap) (Fig. 3, A and B) ties will shrink 

the network, but will not precipitously break it apart. The precise point at which the network 

disintegrates  can  be  determined  by  monitoring

the removal of the weak ties, but there is no phase transition when the strong ties are removed 

first.  

Taken together, these results document a fundamental difference between the global role 

of the strong and weak ties in social networks: the removal of the weak ties leads to a sudden, 

phase transition driven collapse of the whole network. In contrast, the removal of the strong 

ties  results  only  in  the  network’s  gradual  shrinking,  but  not  its  collapse.  This  is  somewhat 

unexpected, since in most technological and biological networks the strong ties are believed 

to play a more important structural role than the weak ties, and in such systems the removal of 

the  strong  ties  leads  to  the  network’s  collapse  (10,  24,  25).  This  counterintuitive  finding 

underlies the distinct role weak and strong ties play in a social network: given that the strong 

ties are predominantly within the communities, their removal will only locally disintegrate a 

community but not affect the network’s overall integrity. In contrast, the removal of the weak 

links will delete the bridges that connect different communities, leading to a phase transition 

driven network collapse.  

The  purpose  of  the  mobile  phone  is  information  transfer  between  two  individuals.  Yet, 

given that the individuals are embedded in a social network, mobile phones allow news and 

rumors  to  diffuse  beyond  the  dyad,  occasionally  reaching  a  large  number  of  individuals,  a 

much studied diffusion problem in both sociology (26) and network science (7). Yet, most of 

our  current  knowledge  about  information  diffusion  is  based  on  analyses  of  unweighted 

networks,  where  all  tie  strengths  are  considered  equal  (26).  To  see  if  the  observed  local 

relationship  between  the  network  topology  and  tie  strength  affects  global  information 

diffusion, at time zero we infect a randomly selected individual with some novel information. 

We assume that at each time step each infected individual v

 can pass the information to its 
i

contact  v

  with  effective  probability
j

P =

,  where  the  parameter  x  controls  the  overall 

spreading  rate  (see  Supplementary  Information).  Therefore,  the  more  time  two  individuals 

spend on the phone, the higher the chance that they will pass on the monitored information. 

As  a  control,  we  consider  spreading  on  the  same  network,  but  replace  all  tie  strengths  with 

their average value

w , resulting in a constant transmission probability for all links. 

 

6

 As  Fig. 4A  shows  (the  real  diffusion  simulation),  we  find  that  information  transfer  is 

significantly faster on the network for which all weights are equal, the difference rooted in a 

dynamic  trapping  of  information  in  communities.  Such  trapping  is  clearly  visible  if  we 

monitor  the  number  of  infected  individuals  in  the  early  stages  of  the  diffusion  process 

(Fig. 4B).  Indeed,  we  observe  rapid  diffusion  within  a  single  community,  corresponding  to 

fast  increases  in  the  number  of  infected  users,  followed  by  plateaus,  corresponding  to  time 

intervals  during  which  no  new  nodes  are  infected  before  the  news  escapes  the  community. 

When we replace all link weights with an average value w  (the control diffusion simulation) 

the  bridges  between  communities  are  strengthened,  and  the  spreading  becomes  a 

predominantly global process, rapidly reaching all nodes through a hierarchy of hubs (24). 

The  dramatic  difference  between  the  real  and  the  control  spreading  process  raises  an 

important question: where do individuals get their information? We find that the distribution 

of the tie strengths through which each individual was first infected (Fig. 4C) has a prominent 

peak  at  w  ∼  102  seconds,  indicating  that  in  the  vast  majority  of  cases  an  individual  learns 

about the news through ties of intermediate strength. The distribution changes dramatically in 

the  control  case,  however,  when  all  tie  strength  are  taken  to  be  equal  during  the  spreading 

process.  In  this  case  the  majority  of  infections  take  place  along  the  ties  that  are  otherwise 

weak  (Fig.  4D).    Therefore,  in contrast  with  the  celebrated  role  of  weak  ties  in  information 

access (

, 
18 20

), we find that both weak and strong ties have a relatively insignificant role as 

conduits  for  information  (“the  weakness  of  weak  and  strong  ties”

):  the  former  because  the 

small amount of on-air time offers little chance of information transfer, and the latter because 

they are mostly confined within communities, with little access to new information.  

To  illustrate  the  difference  between  the  real  and  the  control  simulation,  we  show  the 

spread of information in a small neighborhood (Fig. 4, E and F). First, the overall direction of 

information flow is systematically different in the two cases, as indicated by the large shaded 

arrows.  In  the  control  runs  the  information  mainly  follows  the  shortest  paths.  When  the 

weights are taken into account, however, information flows along a strong tie backbone, and 

large  regions  of  the  network,  connected  to  the  rest  of  the  network  via  weak  ties,  are  only 

rarely  infected.  For  example,  the  lower  half  of  the  network  is  rarely  infected  in  the  real 

simulation but always infected in the control run. Therefore, the diffusion mechanism in the 

network  is  drastically  altered  when  we  neglect  the  tie  strengths,  responsible  for  the 

differences between the curves seen in Fig. 4A and 4B.

While the study of communication and social networks has a long history, examining the 

relationship  between  tie  strengths  and  topology  in  society-spanning  networks  has  generally 

been impossible. In  this  paper,  taking  advantage of society-wide data  collection capabilities 

offered  by  mobile  phone  logs,  we  show  that  tie  strengths  correlate  with  the  local  network 

structure around the tie, and both the dyadic hypothesis and the global efficiency principle are 

unable to account for the empirical observations.  

It has been long known that many networks show resilience to random node removal, but 

are fragile to the removal of the hubs (10,  27,  28,  29). In terms of the links, one would also 

expect that the strong ties play a more important role in maintaining the network’s integrity 

than the weak ones. Our analyses document the opposite effect in communication networks: 

the  removal  of  the  weak  ties  results  in  a  phase  transition  like  network  collapse,  while  the 

removal  of  strong  ties  has  little  impact  on  the  network’s  overall  integrity.  Furthermore,  we 

find that the observed coupling between the network structure and tie strengths significantly 

slows  information  flow,  trapping  it  in  communities,  explaining  why  successful  searches  in 

social  networks  are  conducted  primarily  through  intermediate  to  weak  strength  ties  while 

avoiding  the  hubs  (3).  Therefore,  to  enhance  the  spreading  of  information,  one  needs  to 

intentionally  force  it  through  the  weak  links  or,  alternatively,  adopt  an  active  information 

search procedure. 

Taken  together,  weak  ties  appear  to  be  crucial  for  maintaining  the  network’s  structural 

integrity, but strong ties play an important role in maintaining local communities. Both weak 

and  strong  ties  are  ineffective,  however,  when  it  comes  to  information  transfer,  given  that 

most  news  in  the  real  simulations  reaches  an  individual  for  the  fist  time  via  ties  of 

intermediate strength. 

The  observed  coupling  between  tie  strengths  and  local  topology  has  significant 

implications for our ability to model processes taking place in social networks. Indeed, many 

current network models either assign the same strength to all ties, or assume that tie strengths 

are  determined  by  the  network’s  global  characteristics,  such  as  betweenness  centrality.  In 

addition, some of the most widely used algorithms used to identify communities and groups 

in  complex  networks  use  either  betweenness  centrality  (16),  or  are  based  on  topological 

measures  (30).  Our  finding  that  link  weights  and  betweenness  centrality  are  negatively 

correlated  in  mobile  communication  networks,  together  with  the  insights  provided  by  the 

visually apparent community structure (Fig. 2), offer new opportunities to design  clustering 

 

8

algorithms  that  are  tailored  to  communication  networks,  and  force  us  to  reevaluate  many 

results that were obtained on unweighted graphs. Putting the structural and functional pieces 

together,  we  conjecture  that  communication  networks  are  better  suited  to  local  information 

processing  than  global  information  transfer,  a  result  that  has  the  makings  of  a  paradox. 

Indeed,  the  underlying  reason  for  characterizing  communication  networks  with  global 

network concepts, such as path length and betweenness centrality, is rooted in the expectation 

of communication networks to transmit information globally.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 
 
Preparing the data 
The data used in this study was obtained from a mobile phone operator, from now on referred 
to as the “operator”. We focus exclusively on voice calls, filtering out all other services, such 
as voice mail, data calls, text messages, chat, and operator calls. For the purpose of retaining 
customer  anonymity,  each  subscription  is  identified  by  a  surrogate  key  such  that  it  is  not 
possible  to  recover  the  actual  phone  numbers  from  it.  Since  there  is  no  other  information 
available for identifying or locating customers, this guarantees that their privacy is respected. 
We  have  filtered  out  calls  that  involve  other  operators,  incoming  or  outgoing,  keeping  only 
those transactions in which the calling and receiving subscription is governed by the operator. 
This  filtering  is  needed  to  eliminate  the  bias  between  the  operator  and  other  mobile  service 
providers as we have a full access to the customers of the operator, but only partial access to 
the activity of other providers. 

A  small  fraction  of  the  subscriptions  appears  to  be  used  for  business  or  business-like 
purposes, which appear as users with a very large number of calls never returned. To ensure 
that we are dealing with genuine social interactions, we require links to represent reciprocal 
calls within the investigated time period, so that A needs to call B and vice versa for a link to 
be placed between them. This restriction eliminates telemarketing calls and wrong numbers. It 
is  possible  that  this  induces  some  false  negatives,  i.e.  some  links  corresponding  to  genuine 
social interaction may go undetected. However, since the monitored time window is relatively 
long,  over  one  third  of  a  year,  there  is  plenty  of  time  to  reciprocate  the  calls,  limiting  the 
number of false negatives. 

Two quantities  could be used as tie strengths: the total number and the total duration of 
calls  placed  within  the  period.  As  expected,  these  two  variables  are  statistically  dependent, 
giving  rise  to  Pearson’s  linear  correlation  coefficient  of  0.70.  We  have  chosen  to  use  call 
,  since  they  implicate  the  temporal  and  financial 
durations  as  weights  (or  tie  strengths)  w
ij

commitment  (billing  is  based  on  call  duration)  to  the  relationship.  In  addition,  since  call 
durations  are  measured  in  seconds,  they  can  be  considered  a  continuous  weight  variable, 
whereas the number of calls suffers from strong discretization.  

Given the way we have constructed the network, an interaction, or link, corresponds to a 
social  association  between  two  individuals  and  it  is  by  nature  bi-directional.  It  would  be 
possible  to  retain  directions  in  the  network  using  directed  links  and  thus  have  asymmetric 
weights,  i.e.  w
,  which  would  carry  information  about  the  distribution  of  calls  between 
ij

≠w
ji

any two connected individuals. Yet, given that there is no a priori reason to assume that the 
individual responsible for initiating the call should interact more strongly (after all, both have 
exactly the same call duration), we have neglected the directed nature of the links. 

We allowed for the possibility that there are some very short calls which, when mapped to 
links, could affect the overall topology of the network. To see this, we filtered out links with 
total call duration less than 10 seconds per link over the examined period of 18 weeks. After 
this we filtered out nodes with strengths less than 60 seconds per node over the period, such 
that if a node is filtered out, the links connected to it are also removed. These extremely short

calls  do  not  in  general  represent  true  phone  numbers,  but  rather  mobile  phone  and  service 
updates.  Indeed,  a  common  way  of  obtaining  a  new  handset  is  by  signing  up  for  a  new 
service,  and  after  its  activation the users switch back to the  old  number.  We  call  a  network 
without the reciprocity requirement a non-mutual network, i.e. a one-directional call between 
A and B is sufficient for them to be linked together. In contrast, a network in which the calls 
are  required  to  be  reciprocal  is  called  a  mutual  network.  The  results  of  these  filterings  are 
shown in Table 1. It turns out that imposing the reciprocity condition does eliminate some of 
the  outliers,  which  can  be  best  seen  in  the  degree  distribution  plots  (Fig.  S1).  However, 
filtering seems to have little effect on any of the studied distributions. Consequently, in this 
study we used a mutual network constructed from unfiltered data.

Weak ties conjecture 
A direct conjecture of the weak ties hypothesis is that communities are locally connected by 
single  weak  ties  (1).  Granovetter  justifies  this  conjecture  by  framing  the  hypothesis  more 
precisely  in  order  to  derive  its  implications  for  larger  networks:  “The  triad  which  is  most 
unlikely  to  occur,  under  the  hypothesis  stated  above,  is  that  in  which  A  and  B  are  strongly 
linked, A has a strong tie to some friend C, but the tie between C and B is absent.” Assuming 
that this structure never happens, he arrives at the conjecture.  

We can obtain the conjecture also using slightly different reasoning. Assume that there is a 
single  tie  A-B,  known  as  a  local  bridge,  connecting  two  communities  and  assume  that  it  is 
strong. Based on the weak ties hypothesis, we expect the neighborhoods of A and B (which 
we assume exist) to overlap. But this means that there is another local bridge, a path of length 
2,  connecting  the  nodes  and,  thus,  the  two  communities.  This  contradicts  our  assumption 
about there being just one strong local bridge and, therefore, the bridge must be a weak tie.

Sampling 
The mobile phone call records, from which the network is constructed, were obtained from a 
major  mobile  operator  with  a  market  share  of  approximately  20%  in  the  target  country. 
Although  the  dataset  covers  some  seven  million  users,  it  is  nervertheless  a  sample  of  the 
underlying phone call network that consists of all mobile users in the country. In this section 
we  investigate  the  possible  bias  of  having  a finite  sample  of  the  underlying  network  on  the 
result  shown  in  Fig.  1D,  i.e.,  the  increase  of  overlap 
  as  a  function  of  (cumulative)  tie 
strength.  We  use  the  term  sample  MCG  to  denote  the  network  studied  in  this  paper  and  population 
MCG to denote the entire mobile phone communication network.

Let

denote  the  20%  market  share  of  the  operator  in  the  target  country.  We 
assume that the nodes are all identical and that the probability of a node being governed by 
the operator is independent of the probability of its neighbour being governed by the operator. 
Given  these  assumptions,  we  can  interpret 
p as  the  probability  of  a  randomly  chosen  node 
being governed by the operator and, consequently, its being included in the sample. If we use

Consequently,  it  is  safe  to  assume  that  the  behaviour  of 

    is  unaffected  by  the  finite 
sample. Had we access to the records of all mobile phone users in the country and not just those of a

Since the decreasing trend for top 5% of weights concerns some 325 000 links, it cannot 
possibly be attributed to insufficient statistics. The links in this region correspond to pairs of 
users  who  devote  more  than  three  hours  to  each  other  over  the  investigated  period.  Our 
measurements  indicate,  however,  that  they  have  a  common  property:  These  individuals

Determining the nature and the position of the phase transition point 
The transitions observed in Fig. 3 suggest two important questions: How does the position of 
 depend on the size of the system?  Are the transitions genuine phase

In  many  large  random  systems  studied  by  statistical  mechanics,  from  gases  to  magnetic 
materials, the system is considered infinite in the number of its constituent elements. Different 
quantities of interest can be expressed in terms of the correlation (connectivity) length ξ of the 
|-ν,  where  ν  is  the 
system,  which  in  the  vicinity  of  a  phase  transition  diverges  like  ξ∼|p-p

critical exponent for correlation length. However, in a finite system, the correlation length is 
limited  by  the  system  size,  and  the  divergence  becomes  rounded.  Consequently,  other 
quantities related to the correlation length also show a rounded signature of the divergence, 
but never actually diverge due to finite N (4), as demonstrated for path length in Fig. S5. In

the finiteness of the system (5). We use two different sampling techniques to produce systems 
of different size N. In the first approach, we choose randomly one node in the initial network 
as a source node v
 and extract a radius l neighborhood of this node, including all nodes, and 
s
). The 

links between them, which are at most a distance l from  v
s
size  of  the  sample  depends  exponentially  on  the  extraction  depth  l,  so  that  increasing  the 
value  of  l  enables  us  to  extract  larger  samples,  although  the  realized  sample  size  N  will 
 due to the non-homogeneous topology of the network. We call 
depend on the starting node v

 (less than l links from v
s

such  a  sample  an  extract.  In  the  second  approach,  we  generate  a  sample  of  the  original 
network  by  mimicking  the  process  responsible  for  generating  the  network.  Consider  the 
original network to represent the true underlying social network of which we see only a part, 
since  phone  calls  are  just  one  form  of  social  interaction.  We  then  assign  an  occupation 
probability p to each node in the network, corresponding to the probability that this node is 
governed  by  the  home  operator  and,  thus,  belongs  to  our  sample.  This  means  that  the 
probability  for  a  given  node  to  belong  to  the  sample,  i.e.  to  be  occupied,  is  an  independent 
random  trial  and  does  not  depend  on  whether  its  neighbors  are  occupied.  In  this  sampling 
scheme  varying  the  node  occupation  probability  p  results  in  different  sample  sizes,  just  as 
varying  extraction  depth  l  does  in  the  extract  sampling  scheme.  The  original  network 
corresponds to p=1, whereas if p<1 the network is likely to become fragmented, in which case 
we take the largest connected component (LCC) as our sample. A sample obtained using this 
second method is called a resample.

Fortunately,  Eq. 3  is  valid  for  every  reasonable  definition  of  a  percolation  threshold  for 
finite  large  systems,  and  it  is  only  the  proportionality  constant  that  is  different  for  different 
definitions of the onset of percolation (5). It turns out that in this case the most reliable results 
are  obtained  by  manually  determining  the  transition  point

intercept of the fit. In some cases the coefficient of the second order term is close to zero, so 
that  the  fit  effectively  is  linear.  In  most  cases,  however,  the  fit  is  clearly  curved,  indicating 
that the exponent x is different from -1. Theoretically, the inclusion of the second order term 
can  be  justified  as  a  correction  to  the  leading  scaling  behavior.  The  correction  vanishes  as

The results for ascending thresholding are not quite as clear. The coincidence intervals of 
extracts  and  resamples  for  weight  and  overlap  thresholding  are  [0.89,0.92]  and  [0.93,0.97], 
respectively.  In  the  latter  case  of  ascending  overlap  thresholding,

ascending  weight-driven  thresholding 
  is  not  included  within  two  standard

when  interpreting  the  results  for  ascending  thresholding.  First,  the  behavior  of  the  order 
  as  a  function  of  the  control  parameter  f  is  noisier  for  ascending  than

Overall, the network’s response to removing weak links is qualitatively different from the

times for the simulation. The reason for this is the highly skewed weight distribution P(w), so 
that normalizing with the globally maximum weight, which can be seen as an outlier, results 
in very low transmission probabilities for most links, requiring a large number of trials before 
any  macroscopic  spreading  takes  place.  This  problem  is  amplified  by  the  fact  that  the 
simulations, both for empirical and random network, should be carried out for an ensemble.  

We  can  circumvent  this  problem  by  lowering  the  value  of  x,  which  speeds  up  the 
simulations without affecting the qualitative behavior of the system and, thus, it can be seen 
  for  the 
as  a  rescaling  of  the  time  axis  (Fig. 4,  A  and  B).  This  introduces  a  cut-off

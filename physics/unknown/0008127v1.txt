Abstract

Spurious  oscillations  in  klystrons  due  to  returning
electrons  from  the  collector  into  the  drift  tube  were
observed  and  studied  at  KEK.  Simulations  of  returning
electrons  using  EGS4  Monte  Carlo  method  have  been
performed. And the oscillation conditions are described in
this paper.

1    INTRODUCTION

A  high-power  324MHz  klystron  (3MW  output  power,
650m s  pulse  width,  and  110kV  beam  voltage)  is  being
developed  at  KEK  as  a  microwave  source  for  the  200
MeV Linac of the KEK/JEARI Joint Project for the high-
intensity  proton  accelerator  facility.  However  during
high-voltage  processing  of  the  klystron  tube  #1,  strong
spurious  oscillations  were  observed  when  there  was  no
input  power.  These  oscillations  were  caused  by  the
returning electrons from the collector into the drift tube of
the  klytron. As  the  returning  electrons  modulated  by  the
gap voltage of the output cavity will induce a gap voltage
in  the  input  cavity,  an  input  cavity  voltage  is  possibly
regenerated  by  the  returning  electrons  to  cause  the
oscillations.

In order to examine the conditions of these oscillations,
a  simulation  of  returning  electrons  was  conducted  using
EGS4[1]. The coefficients and energy distributions of the
returning  electrons  were  investigated  at  a  range  of  beam
voltages and with a variety of collector shapes, in order to
examine the oscillation conditions thoroughly.

2    OSCILLATION    PHENOMENA    AND

OSCILLATION    SOURCE

    During  the  high-voltage  processing  of  the  324MHz
klystron  tube  #1,  unexpected  oscillations  were  observed
from both the output and input cavities when there was no
driving input power. These oscillations occurred when the
beam  voltage  was  either  63~71kV  or  larger  than  90kV,
and had a frequency close to 324MHz.

When  a  magnetic  field  was  applied  at  the  collector
region  to  deflect  the  electron  beam,  the  oscillations

indicates 

that 

the  source  of 

stopped.  This 
these
oscillations  was  the  collector  region.  However,  as  there
was  no  resonance  of  frequency  close  to  324MHz
corresponding  to  the  dimensions  of  the  collector,  the
oscillations  were  assumed  to  be  the  result  of  returning
electrons.

The collector size was accordingly changed to evaluate
its  effect  on  the  returning  electrons.  A  collector  with  a
larger  radius  and  longer  in  length  was  used  in  the  tube
#1A,  where  the  results  of  the  experiment  indicated  that
the  oscillations  disappeared  for  the  low  beam  voltage
region  and  started  from  95kV.  When  the  length  of  the
collector was increased further in the tube #2, again there
were no oscillations at the low beam voltage region, and
these did not occur until the beam voltage level was even
higher.  The  shapes  of  the  collectors  are  shown  in  Fig.1
and  the  oscillation  regions  for  the  three  tubes  are
summarized in table 1.

3.1    Oscillation Mechanism

    In  the  klystron,  after  the  electrons  of  the  main  beam
bombard  the  surface  of  the  collector,  back-scattered
electrons  are  produced  due  to  an  inelastic  process  with
atomic  electrons,  and  some  of  these  back-scattered
electrons  return  into  the  drift  tube  of  the  klystron.  As
these  returning  electrons  are  modulated  by  the  gap
voltage of the output cavity(Vo), they induce an rf voltage
in the input cavity(Vf). In this way, the returning electrons
and  the  main  beam  of  the  klystron  form  a  feedback
loop(Fig.2)  and 
spurious
oscillations .

to  cause

cavity voltage modulating the main beam. b

3.2    Simulations of Returning Electrons

trajectories  for 

    The  EGS4(Electron  Gamma  Shower)  Monte  Carlo
method  was  applied  to  the  simulation  of  back-scattered
and  returning  electrons  in  a  klystron  collector  with  an
external  magnetic  field[2].  The 
the
incident  electron  beam  were  calculated  initially  with
space-charge  forces,  relativistic  effects,  self-field  and
external  magnetic  fields.  The  cathode  radius  was  4.5cm
and  the  magnetic  field  on  the  cathode  surface  was
130Gauss. The beam radius was 3.5cm at the entrance of
collectors and the focusing magnetic field on the Z axis in
the  collector  region  is shown  in  Fig.3. The  conditions  at
the start of the EGS4 Monte Carlo simulation were based
on  the  above  calculations  for  the  incident  electron
positions,  and 
their  velocities  and  energies  when
bombarding  the  surface  of  the  collector.  The  trajectories
of the incident electron beam, and the back-scattered and
returning electrons are shown in Fig.4 for tubes #1, #1A,
and #2.

Calculations of the coefficients and distributions of the

Z-component of  the  energy(Ez)  normalized  by  the  beam
voltage(Eo)  for  the  returning  electrons  reveled  that  the
coefficients and the peaks of the energy distributions for
Ez/Eo  were  also  identical  under  different  beam  voltages
for a given collector.

  Simulations  of  the  returning  electrons  were  carried
out  with  a  variety  of  collector  shapes. When  the  size  of
the  collector  was  enlarged,  the  amount  of  returning
electrons  decreased.  The  returning  coefficients  were
0.68%, 0.17%, and 0.14% for the collectors of tubes #1,
#1A,  and  #2,  respectively.  The  energy  distributions  for
Ez/Eo are shown in Fig.5. The shapes of the distributions
differ slightly between the different collectors.

3.3    Oscillation Conditions

Returning  electrons  modulated  by  the  output  cavity
voltage will induce an rf voltage in the input cavity. If the
phase of this induced voltage is the same as the phase of
the voltage modulating the main beam, and the amplitude
is  larger  than  the  latter,  then  an  input  cavity  voltage  is
regenerated  by  the  returning  electrons,  and  spurious
oscillations will occur.

In other words, the oscillation conditions are:

respectively.

 can be calculated from the rf current of the returning
electrons. As the returning electron current is very small,
and the onset of the spurious oscillations is in the small-
signal-linear  region,  it  is  possible  to  apply  the  ballistic
theory. As the contribution from the output cavity voltage
is larger than the others, we just consider the output and
input cavities.

It is necessary to modify the formula for the rf current
in the ballistic  theory for  the returning  electrons,  to  take
into  consideration  the  energy  distributions,  h (x),  of  the
returning electrons, which is a polynomial function fitted
to  the  distribution  shape  for  each  of  the  collectors,  as
shown in Fig.5.

voltages  of  65kV,  70kV,  and  75kV.  We  can  see  that,
between 65 and 70kV, some frequency components exist
that satisfy the oscillation conditions, |A(w )	b

The  oscillation  regions  of  tube  #1  obtained  from  the
calculations  were  64~70kV  and  larger  than  79kV.  For
tubes  #1A  and  #2,  the  calculation  indicate  that  the
oscillation regions of beam voltage larger than 100kV and
105kV, respectively, due to decreases in the current for the
returning electron. These calculations are close to values
obtained for the oscillation regions in the experiments.

4    CONCLUSION

A  Mechanism  to  produce  returning  electrons  in  a
collector  was  successfully  simulated  using  EGS4.  A
simple  analysis  was  conducted,  which  took  into  account
the returning electrons, and was in close agreement with
the  experiment  results.  Although  reversing  electrons  are
sometimes  produced  at  the  output  cavity  and  cause
instabilities, those were not analyzed in the present paper,
which  focused  on  the  oscillations  due  to  returning
electrons from the collector.

ABSTRACT

A precise meaning is given to the notion of continuous iteration of
a mapping. Usual discrete iterations are extended into a dynamical
flow which is a homotopy of them all. The continuous iterate
reveals that a dynamic map is formed by independent component
modes evolving without interference with each other.

1.  Introduction

There  are  two  main  approaches  to  describe  the  evolution  of  a

dynamical  system.1  The  first  has  its  roots  in  classical  mechanics  –  the

solutions  of  the  dynamical  differential  equations  provide  the  continuous

motion of the representative point in phase space.2 The  second takes a quite

different point of view: it models evolution by the successive iterations of  a

well-chosen map, so that the state is known after  each step, as if  the "time"

parameter of the system were only defined at discrete  values.3  It  is possible

to go from the first kind of description to the  second through  the snapshots

leading to a Poincaré map. Our  aim here  is to  present  the first  steps into  a

converse  procedure,  going  from  a  discrete  to  a  continuous  description

while  preserving  the  idea  of  iteration.  This  is  possible  if  we  are  able  to

"interpolate"  between the discrete  values in  such  a  way  that  the  notion  of

iteration keeps its meaning in the intervals.

Iteration  is a particular  case  of  function  composition:  given  a  basic

map f(x) = f<1>(x) , its  first  iterate  is f<2>(x)  =  [f  o  f](x)  =  f  [f(x)], its n-th
iterate  is    f<n>(x)  =  f  [f<n-1>(x)]  =  f<n-1>[f(x)],  etc.  The  question  is
whether or not,  given the set of  functions f<n>(x),  an interpolation  f<t>(x)

with  real  values  of  t  can  be  found  which  represents  the  one-parameter

continuous  group  (or  semigroup)  describing  the  dynamical  flow  of  the
system. In order to do it, f<t> should satisfy the conditions

f<t>[f<t'>(x)] = f<t'>[f<t>(x)] = f<t+t'>(x);

 f<0>(x) = Id(x) = x.

(1.1)

(1.2)

We shall find in  what follows a map interpolation  f<t>(x)  with  these

properties.  It  is a well-known  fact  that  Taylor  series  f(x),  g(x)  satisfying

4

the conditions f(0)  =  0,  g(0)  =  0  and  with  nonvanishing  coefficients  of  x

are invertible and  constitute a group  by  composition.4  The  neutral  element

is the identity function e(x) = Id(x) =  x    and two functions f,  g  are  inverse

to each other if it is true that f [g(x)] = g [f(x)] = Id(x) = x. In this case, g =
f<-1> and f = g<-1> (we are taking the  liberty  of  using the word  "function"

even  for  purely  formal  series  and  multi-valued  maps).  The  clue  to  the

question  lies  in  the  formalism  of  Bell  polynomials,  which  attributes  to

every such a function f a matrix  B[f], whose inverse  represents  the inverse

function  and  such  that  the  matrix  product  represents  the  composition

operation. In other words, these matrices provide a linear representation  of

the  group  formed  by  the  functions  with  the  operation  of  composition.

Composition  is  thus  represented  by  matrix  product  and,  consequently,

iterations  are 

represented  by  matrix  powers.  Furthermore, 

the

representation  is faithful,  and  the  function  f  is  completely  determined  by

B[f].  Now,  in  the  matrix  group  there  does  exist  a  clear  interpolation  of

discrete  powers  by  real  powers  and the inverse  way,  going  from  matrices

to functions, yields a map interpolation with the desired properties.

Section 2  is a short  presentation  of  Bell  polynomials,  with  only  the

minimum information necessary to our present objective. It is shown how a

matrix B[f] can be found which represents each formal series f, and that the

composition f o g  of  two functions is represented  by  the (right-)product  of

the respective matrices: B[f o g] = B[g]B[f]. The identity matrix corresponds
to the identity function,  B[Id] =  I,  the matrix  B[f<n>] corresponding  to  the
n-th iterate f<n> is the n-th power Bn[f] and the Lagrange  inverse  f<-1> to  a

series f  is  represented  by  the  respective  inverse  matrix,  B[f<-1>]  =  B-1[f].
The  necessity of  finding  Bt[f] for  non-integer  "t"  leads  to  the  problem  of

5

defining  functions  of  matrices,  succinctly  discussed  in  section  3.  Given  a

matrix  B,  there  exists  a  very  convenient  basis  of  projectors  in  terms  of

which any function  of  B is defined in  a simple way.  A method is given to

obtain the members of this basis in a closed form, in terms of powers  of  B.
The  procedure  is  applied  to  Bell  matrices  in  section  4  to  obtain  Bt  [f]  =
B[f<t>] for any value of t, from which the function f<t>(x) can be extracted

and shown to satisfy conditions (1.1-2).  It  turns  out  that,  though it  is quite

natural  to  call  "time"  the  continuous  label  t,  this  "time"  is  related  to  a

certain class of flows, amongst all those leading to a specific Poincaré  map.

There is an extra bonus: the matrix decomposition in terms  of  projectors  is

reflected  in  a decomposition of  the original  map,  and of  its  iterate,  into  a

sum  in  terms  of  certain  "elementary  functions",  each  one  with  an

independent and well-defined time evolution.

2.  Bell  matrices

Given a formal series with vanishing constant term,

 g(x) = (cid:229)

 g j
j!    xj ,

j=1

 (2.1)

coefficients gi, defined by

n

k!  { d

  [g(t)]k)}t=0 .

(2.2)

Their  properties  are  in  general  obtained  from  their  appearance  in  the

multinomial theorem, which reads

  Bnk (g1, g2, . . . , gn-k+1).  (2.3)

Depending on the situation, one or another of the notations

Bnk[g] = Bnk(g1, g2, . . . , gn-k+1) = Bnk{gj} , 

 (2.4)

is more  convenient. The  symbol {gj}  represents  the Taylor  coefficient list

of g, with gj a typical  member.  Some properties  coming immediately from

the multinomial theorem are the following:

Bn1 [g] = gn ;
Bnn [g] = (g1)n ; 
Bnk [cg(t)] = ck Bnk [g(t)] ; 
Bnk [g(ct)] = cn Bnk [g(t)]  ,

where c is a constant. Given two formal Taylor series

Series like  (2.1)  constitute  a  group  under  the  composition  operation  (f  o

g)(x) = f [g(x)]. The identity series "e" such that  e(x) = Id(x)  =  x  plays the

role  of  the  neutral  element  and  each  series  g  possesses  an  inverse  g<-1>,

satisfying g<-1>  o  g  =  g  o  g<-1>  =  e  and  given  by  the  Lagrange  inversion

formula. The simplest example of a  Bell matrix  and its inverse  is given by

the well-known case of  the Stirling  numbers:  matrices  formed  by  the first

and second kind  Stirling  numbers  are  inverse  to  each  other,  because  they

correspond to functions inverse to each other. In effect, consider the series

whose inverse is

A generating function for the Stirling numbers of the first kind sk

It follows from (2.3) that

The  polynomials  Bnk[g]  are  the  entries  of  a  (lower-)triangular

matrix  B[g], with  n  as row  index and k  as the column  index.  From  (2.5),

the function coefficients constitute the first  column,  so that actually B[g] is

an overcomplete  representative  of  g.  From  (2.6),  the  eigenvalues  of  B[g]

are  (g1)j. Triangular  matrices  form  a group,  of  which  the  set  of  matrices

(Bnk) constitutes a subgroup.  Hereby  comes  the  most  fascinating  property

of  Bell  polynomials:  the  matrices  B[g]  =  (Bnk[g]),  with  the  operation  of

matrix product, provide a representation of the series composition group:

B [g] B [f] = B [f o g] .

 (2.20)

It is  in  reality  an anti-representation  because of  the inverse  order,  but  this
does not represent any problem. This property comes  easily by  using twice
(2.3), as

which is just (2.20). Associativity can be easily checked, and it  is trivial  to
see that the "identity" series e(x) = x  has the representative Bnk[e] =  d
that  B[e]  =  I.  Series  g(t)  with  g1 =  0  can  be  attributed  a  matrix,  but  a

nk, so

singular  one  and,  consequently,  outside  the  group.  Summing  up,  infinite

Bell matrices  constitute a  linear  representation  of  the  group  of  invertible

formal  series.  If  we consider  only  the first  N rows  and columns, what we

have  is  an  approximation,  but  it  is  important  to  notice  that  the  group

properties hold at each order N. The general aspect of a Bell  matrix  can be

illustrated by the case N = 5:

B[g] =

The result (2.19) is the best example of the general property  

B[f] B[f<-1>] = I  . 

 (2.23)

It is evident that, given the series f, its inverse series can be obtained from

B[f<-1>] = B-1[f] 

 (2.24)

by simple matrix inversion. The inversion properties  of  Bell matrices  have

been  used  in  the  study  of  cluster  expansions  for  real  gases.6  Because
B[g<n>] = Bn[g], Bell matrices convert function iteration into matrix power

and provide a linearization of the process of iteration.

Suppose  now  that  we  are  able  to  obtain  the  matrix  Bt,  with  t  an
arbitrary  real  number.  The  continuous  iteration  of  g(x)  will  then  be  that
function g<t> such that B[g<t>] = Bt [g]. By (2.5), its Taylor coefficients are

preliminary incursion into the subject of matrix functions.

3.  Matrix  functions

Suppose a function  F(l )  is given which can be expanded as a power
  -  l o|  <  r .

 -  l o)k  inside  the  convergence  circle  |l

 ck(l

series F(l )  = S

k=0

Then the function F(B), whose argument  is now a given N· N matrix  B,  is
ck(B - l o)k and has a sense whenever the eigenvalues

defined by F(B) = S

k=0

of B lie within  the convergence circle.  Given the eigenvalues x1, x2, .  .  .  ,
xN, the set of eigenprojectors {Zj[B] = |xj><xj|} constitutes a basis in which

B is written

N

B = (cid:229)

j=1

  xj Zj[B] , 

     F(B) = (cid:229)

 F(xj) Zj[B] .

N

j=1

and the function F(B), defined as above, can also be written7 as the matrix

Thus,  for  example,  eB  =  S N

j=1exj  Zj  and  B
{Zj[B]}  depends  on  B,  but  is  the  same  for  every  function  F.  The    Zj's,
besides being projectors (that is, idempotents, Z2

j =  Zj),  can be normalized

Zj[B].  The  basis

so that tr (Zj) = 1 for each j and are then orthonormal by the trace, tr(ZiZj)

j=1F(xj)Zj
and tr[BkZj] =  (xj)k. If  B is a normal  matrix  diagonalized by  a  matrix  U,

UBU-1 =  Bdiagonal, then the entries  of  Zk are  given by  (Zk)rs =  U-1

A set of  N powers  of  B is enough  to  fix  the  projector  basis.  Using

for  F(B) in (3.2) the power functions B0 = I, B1, B2, . . . ,  BN-1, we have I

the  Cayley-Hamilton  theorem,8  by  which  B  satisfies  its  own  secular

j=1Zj; B = S N
N-1Zj. For k ‡

equation

D (x) = det [x I - B] = (x-x1)(x-x2)(x-x3) . . . (x-xN)  = 0.

D (B)  =  0  will  give BN in  terms  of  lower  powers  of  B,  so  that  the  higher

powers of B can be computed from the lower powers.

Inversion  of  the above expressions for  the powers  of  B  in  terms  of

the Zj's leads to a closed form for each Zj,

Zj[B] = 

(B - x1)(B - x2). . .(B - xj-1)(B - xj+1)...(B - xN-1)(B - xN )
(xj - x1)(xj - x2) ... (xj - xj-1)(xj - xj+1) ... (xj - xN - 1)(xj - xN )

The function F(B) is consequently given by

F(B) = S

 (3.4)

Thus,  in  order  to  obtain F(B),  it  is  necessary  to  find  the  eigenvalues  of  B

and the detailed form of  its first  (N-1)  powers.  Though  for  N not  too  large

the Zj[B]'s  can  be  directly  computed,  we  shall  give  closed  expressions  for

them.  These  expressions 

involve  some  symmetric  functions  of 

the

eingenvalues.

Let  us  examine  the  spectrum  {xk}  of  B  in  some  more  detail.  The

eigenvalues  xk  will  be  called  "letters"  and  indicated  collectively  by  the

12

"alphabet" x  =  {x1, x2, x3, .  .  .  ,  xN}.  A monomial  is  a  "word".  It  will  be

convenient to consider both the alphabet x  and its "reciprocal",  the alphabet

x* = {x*1, x*2, x*3, . . . , x*N} where each x*j = -1/xj. Notice that taking  the

reciprocal is  an involution,  x**  =  x.  A symmetric  function  in  the variables

x1,  x2,  x3,  .  .  .  ,  xN  is  any  polynomial  P(x1,  x2,  x3,  .  .  .  ,  xN)  which  is

invariant under all the permutations  of  the xk's.  Only one kind  of  them will
be needed here,  the “j-th  elementary  symmetric  functions”,   s

j =  sum of  all

words with j distinct letters:

s 0[x] = 1 (by convention)
1[x] = x1+ x2 + x3 + . . . + xN ;  
2[x] = x1x2+ x1x3 + ... + x1xN  + ... + x2x3 + x2x4  + ... + ... + xN-1xN;

 . . .

N[x] = x1x2x3  . . .  xN-1xN .

matrices,  it  will  be convenient to  use instead  the  basis  {B,  B2,  .  .  .,  BN}.

This  is due to  the fact that we shall  prefer  to  start  from  the  matrix  B[g],

corresponding  to  g,  and  not  from  the  matrix  I,  corresponding  to  the

identity  function.  The  mappings  of  interest,  like  the  logistic  map  for
example,  have  a  general  "˙ "  aspect  and  cannot  be  obtained  continuously
from  the identity map: the  identity  map  has  Brower9  degree  1,  while  the

dynamical maps have degree 0.  The  Cayley-Hamilton theorem  implies S N

The  projectors  are  now  clearly  in  the  basis  {B,  B2,  .  .  .,  BN}.  Actually,

each Zi is now just that given in  the basis {I,  B,  B2, .  .  .,  BN-1} multiplied

by (B/xi): instead of (3.3),

Zj[B] = 

(B - x1)(B - x2). . .(B - xj-1) B (B - xj+1)...(B - xN-1)(B - xN )
(x j - x1)(xj - x2) ... (xj - xj-1) xj (x j - xj+1) ... (xj - xN - 1)(xj - xN )  .

Bell matrices are not normal, that is, they do not commute  with  their

transposes.  Normality  is  the  condition  for  diagonalizability.  This  means

that  Bell  matrices  cannot  be  put  into  diagonal  form  by  a  similarity

transformation. As it happens, this will not be a difficulty because we know

their eigenvalues. That functions of matrices  are  completely determined  by

their  spectra  is justified  on  much  more  general  grounds.  Matrix  algebras

are very particular  kinds of  von Neumann algebras  and it  is a very  strong

result  of  the still more  general  theory  of  Banach  algebras11  that  functions

on  such  spaces,  as  long  as  they  can  be  defined,  are  fixed  by  the  spectra.

Another  point  worth  mentioning  is  that  the  infinite  Bell  matrices  which

constitute the true, complete representation of the group of invertible series
  of  N· N  matrices,  to  a  hyperfinite  von
will  belong,  as limits for  N  ﬁ 

Neumann  algebra.  Our  considerations  here  are  purely  formal  from  the

mathematical point  of  view,  as  we  are  only  discussing  formal  series.  We

are  not  concerned  with  the  topological  intricacies  involved  in  the

convergence problems, though they surely  deserve  a detailed study.  By the

way, the infinite algebra  generated  by  Bell matrices  would provide  a good

guide in the study of function algebras with the composition operation.

4.  The  continuous  iterate

We are now in condition to find, given a function g, the matrix Bt [g]
and  its  corresponding  function,  the  continuous  iterate  g<t>(x).  As  many

things  –  the  B[g]  spectrum  for  example  –  will  depend  only  on  the  first-

¥
17

order  Taylor  coefficient,  we shall put  g1  =  a.  By  (2.6),  the  letters  in  the

eigenvalue-alphabet of B[g] will be simple powers of a and the alphabet a =

(a1, a2,...., aN) will have the reciprocal a* = (-a-1, -a-2,...., -a-N). The  matrix

 has entries (L

ik) = (aik) and the projectors

As they have not  the form  (2.22),  they cannot be the Bell matrices  of  any

function. They inherit, however, a  good property  of  the Bell matrices:  for

each  N,  the  projectors  Zj

(N)  contain,  in  their  higher  rows,  the  projectors

Zj

(k) for all k <  N.  The  upper-left  2· 2 submatrices of  the Zk

(3)'s above are

just Zk

(2).

We can take  the  first-column  entries  of  the  matrix  (4.1)  as  Taylor

coefficients defining the functions

To each projector Zi corresponds such  an "elementary  function"  Ri

relationship  reflecting  in  part  that  between  the  series  and  their  Bell

matrices. Taking the summation of  all Ri

It is  tempting to  conjecture  that the elementary  functions Ri play,  in

function  space  and  with  the  operation  of  composition,  the  role  of

projectors.  In  fact,  this  is  not  so.  Their  properties  mirror  only  partially

those  of  the  projectors  Zi.  If  we  calculate  Ri  [Rj(x)]  using  (4.4)  and  the
multinomial theorem,  we find  Ri [Rj(x)] =  Ri(xj/j!). The  composition gives
rise to a   change in  the variable.  Thus,  the functions Ri fail  even to  satisfy

the defining idempotent property: in general, Ri o Ri 

 Ri.

We can introduce e  = ln a and rewrite (4.13) as

x(t) = g<t>(xo) = (cid:229)

  eke t Rk(xo) ,

(4.22)

k‡ 1

a  decomposition  of  g<t>(x)  into  a  sum  of  modes,  each  one  evolving

independently according to

xk(t) = eke txk(0) = eke t Rk(xo). 

(4.23)

The  imaginary  "frequency"  ke   plays  the  role  of  a  “modular  Lyapunov

exponent” of the k-th  mode.  We have thus a "multi-hamiltonian"  flow  x(t)

with  one  hamiltonian  for  each  projector  component:  equations  (4.16,17)

„
22

show Rk

(N) as a representation of the one-dimensional group  engendered  by

the k-th dynamical flow

          Rk[g<t>(x)] = eke t Rk[g<0>(x)] .

(4.24)

The  function  g<t>(x)  is  actually  a  Lagrange  interpolation  in  the
convenient variable (g1)t  =  at, which coincides with  the discrete  iterates  at
each  integer  value  of  t  and  keeps  the  meaning  of  a  continuum  iterate  in

between. It is a homotopy of all the usual discrete  iterations.  As announced

in Section 3, we have used the basis {B, B2, B3, . . . , BN}, instead of  {I,  B,

B2, .  .  .  ,  BN-1}, because in  the latter  the  matrix  “I”  would  correspond  to

the  identity  function  Id(x)  =  x,  which  does  not  belong  to  the  same

homotopy class.

The  variable  t  has  been  given  the  sense  of  a  "time".  If  it  is  really
time, g<n>(x) will give the n-th point of a Poincaré map. Now,  there  are  in

principle  (infinitely)  many  dynamical  flows  corresponding  to  a  given
Poincaré map. The  function  g<t>(x)  as given above would correspond  to  a

class  of  them,  that  of  the  flows  with  equal  intervals  of  time  between

successive  points  on  the  Poincaré  section.  To  consider  other  cases,  we

recall  that  any  strictly  monotonous  function  of  a  first-given  "time"  is

another "time".

We  cannot  resist  exhibiting  a  last  “thing  of  beauty”.  By  the  very

manner  it  has  been  obtained,  the  expression  (4.12)  for  the  continuum

iterate is equivalent to the highly mnemonic determinantal equation

23

g<1>(x) a
a2 ... ... aN
g<2>(x) a2 a4 ... ... a2N
g<3>(x) a3 a6 ... ... a3N

g<t>(x) at a2t ... ... aNt

... ...

. . .

. . .

  = 0.

(4.25)

Expansion  along  the  first  column  or  the  last  row  and  comparison  with
(4.11)  and  (4.13)  will  give  determinant  expressions  for  C(N)

k(t)  and

(N)(x).

5.  Concluding  remarks

In  the  passage  from  functions  to  Bell  matrices,  composition  is

translated into matrix product and iteration into matrix powers. Continuous

powers  of  matrices  have  a  sound  meaning,  which  is  translated  back  into

continuous  iteration  and  makes  of  it  also  a  sound  concept,  respecting

properties  (1.1-2).  The  usual  discrete  iterations  are  thus  extended  into  a

continuous  flow.  The  term-by-term  factorization  of  the  x-  and  t-

dependencies of g<t>(x) reveals itself as a decomposition into  independently

evolving modes, one for each projector of the corresponding Bell matrix.

Once  it  is  established  that  iteration  can  have  a  continuous  meaning

and is, furthermore, a homotopy, new possibilities are  made open to  study,

such as the use of  the conservation  of  degrees  like Brower’s  and  Morse’s.

It is our contention that, with the continuum version of iterations, it  will  be

possible  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  detailed  unfolding  of

bifurcations and of the general relationship between the differential  and the

mapping approaches  to chaotic dynamics.

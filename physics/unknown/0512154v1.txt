ABSTRACT 

An overview of the tomographic interpretation method in engineering geophysics is presented, considering the 
two  approaches  of  the  deterministic  tomography  inversion,  developed  for  rock  elasticity  analysis,  and  the 
probability tomography imaging developed in the domain of potential fields methods. The theoretical basis of 
both approaches is shortly outlined before showing a laboratory and a field application. 
 
 
 

 

 
 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

 
Geophysical prospecting is widely applied to help resolve 
many  problems  in  civil  and  environmental  engineering. 
The probability of a successful application at a given site 
rapidly increases if different methods are used, basing the 
selection on the principles of complementarity and cohe-
rency of information. Such a strategy is mainly advisable 
in delicate environments, where absolutely non-intrusive 
geophysics is the only possibility for target identification, 
prior to direct exploration works [1]. 

The interpretation of geophysical datasets to elaborate 
accurate images of the investigated structures has always 
been a difficult task, due to the mathematical difficulties 
and heavy calculations involved in modeling approaches. 
Favourably, the newest hardware and software generation 
has raised to such a high level of sophistication to allow, 
at last, a routine application of the complex imaging tools 
so far developed. 

In the following sections an outline of the tomography 
imaging  in  engineering  geophysics  is  reported,  focussed 
on  the  two  approaches  of  the  deterministic  tomography 
(DT),  developed  in  rock  elasticity,  and  the  probabilistic 
tomography (PT), proposed for potential field methods. 
 
 
DETERMINISTIC TOMOGRAPHY INVERSION 

 
The DT  inversion in  seismic prospecting  was  developed 
to derive a detailed geometrical model of the elastic wave 
velocity pattern in a medium, starting from the measured 
wave travel times from sources to receivers [2] (fig.1). 

The relationship relying the wave travel time ti to the 
unknown slowness function s(x,y,z) for a ray along the i-
th path li of a set of M paths, is given by Fermat integral

By defining the delay time as the difference between 
the measured travel time and the travel time in an a priori 
assigned reference  uniform  medium  and subdividing the 
medium into N elementary cells, with the application of a 
perturbation technique it is possible to deduce from eq.1 
a system of linear equations in matrix form as 

 
δt=R⋅δs, 
 

 

 

 

 

  (2) 

where δt is a column matrix, whose element δti (i=1,..,M) 
is  the  delay  time  along  the  i-th  path,  R  is  a  rectangular 
sparse matrix, whose element rij (i=1,..,M; j=1,..,N) is the 
path length of the i-th ray in the j-th cell, and δs is a line 
matrix,  whose  element δsj  (j=1,..,N)  is  the  slowness  de-
parture  from  the  reference  model  in  the  j-th  elementary 
cell.

If  the  space  of  the  experimental  data  has  dimensions 
much  greater  than  those  of  the  space  of  the  unknowns 
(M»N), the system (2) becomes overdetermined. A least-
squares procedure can thus be applied, by minimizing the 
Euclidean  norm  ║R·δs−δt║.  The  solution  for  the  vector 
δs is then given as 

 

 
δs=(RTR)−1RTδt=A−1RTδt. 
 
In solving eq.3 one may encounter serious difficulties, 
essentially related to  the  presence of  small  values  in  the 
matrix to invert. Thus, it is preferable to constrain matrix 
A by introducing a damping factor β and use as solution 
for δs the equation 

  (3) 

 

 
δs=(A−βI)−1RTδt, 
 

 

where I is the identity matrix. 

  (4) 

To increase the resolution power of the DT method an 
iterative procedure can be applied, consisting in using the 
slowness model drawn from an inversion as the reference 
model  for  a  new  inversion.  Iterations  will  be  stopped  as 
soon as the mean departure between the slowness values 
got from the k-th and (k-1)-th iterations is in modulus not 
greater than a pre-fixed discrepancy factor ∆, i.e.

PROBABILISTIC TOMOGRAPHY IMAGING  

 
The purpose of the PT procedure is to retrieve an image 
of  the spatial distribution of  the  occurrence  probabilities 
of the sources of the observed anomalies [3,4]. 

Consider a reference coordinate system with the (x,y)-
plane at sea level and the z-axis positive upwards, and a 
survey surface S with uneven topography (see fig.2). Let 
A(r) be the anomaly value at a station located at r≡(x,y,z), 
with r∈S, and assume that it can be discretized as a sum 
of partial effects due to Q elementary sources, viz.

The q-th elementary source, located at rq≡(xq,yq,zq), is 
given a strength aq and its effect at the station at r≡(x,y,z) 
is analytically described by the kernel s(r-rq).

The SEOP function meets the condition −1≤η(rq)≤+1, 
and is interpreted as a measure of the probability, which a 
source  element  with  strength  aq  placed  at  rq  obtains  as 
responsible of the whole observed anomaly field A(r). 

The PT procedure for a dataset collected on a non-flat 
topography  S  consists  in  a  scanning  procedure  based  on 
the knowledge of the s(r-rq) function that is called space 
domain scanner. It is a function depending on the method 
used  for sensing  the  earth  and  is generally well defined, 
since it represents the physical behaviour of the field due 
to a source element (e.g. resistivity element [5], electrical 
current filament [6], gravitational mass [7], etc.). 

In practice, as the true source distribution responsible 
of an observed anomaly field A(r) is unknown, a positive 
source element of unitary strength can be used to scan the 
exploration  volume (the  tomospace)  to  search where  the 
sources are most probably located. For any tern xq,yq,zq in 
the tomospace, the integral (10) gives the probability that 
a positive (η>0) or negative source (η<0) located in that 
point is responsible for the A(r) field detected on surface. 
By scanning the tomospace along a sequence of slices, a 
3D  image  reconstruction  of  the  sources  distribution  can 
be finally drawn in a probabilistic sense.

matrix (vp=1.6 km/s). The measurements were done using

digital oscilloscope. 

The block was ideally subdivided in 64 equal cells of 
volume (4×4×6) cm3. The measuring procedure consisted 
each time in fixing the pair of transmitter and receiver at 
the centre of the vertical facelets of area (4×6) cm2, lying 
along the opposite faces of the block, and moving one or 
both transducers at the constant step of 4 cm, as shown in 
fig.3. In order to improve resolution, the transmitter and 
receiver roles were interchanged, thus obtaining a total of 
M=256 ray paths

inversion. Results of the iterated DT algorithm. 

The  results  obtained  from  the  application  of  the  DT 
algorithm are shown in the 2D map of fig.4. A damping 
factor β=0.1 and a discrepancy factor ∆=1 were assumed. 
A clear conformity appears between the irregular form of 
the piece of marble and its reconstructed physical image. 
This  picture,  jointly  with  the  reasonable  estimate  of  the 
velocity profile, demonstrates how high is the resolution 
this DT technique can reach, at least in laboratory.

near and over waste disposal sites. It helps mapping both 
the  vertical  and  horizontal  distribution  of  contamination

caused  by  increase  of  solutes  in  groundwater  relative  to 
background levels, which is reflected in some increase of 
the electrical conductivity of the water bearing rock [8]. 

Dipole-dipole profiling is the most adopted technique, 
as it provides high vertical and lateral sensitivity. The so 
called pseudo-section representation allows a preliminary 
inspection to be made in terms of apparent resistivity. 

Figs.5 and 6 refer to a field case performed on a waste 
disposal site, consisting of a waterproofed basin dug out 
in a sandy-clayey layer down to 17 m of depth b.g.l.. The 
basin was wholly filled with wastes and leaks of pollutant 
were suspected across tears in the impermeable sheets of 
5 mm of thickness.

central part of the section shows, instead, very low values 
of about 1 Ωm along the whole depth scale with presence 
of small nuclei enclosing even lower values. 

Fig.6 shows the results of the PT algorithm applied to 
the pseudo-section of fig.5. The most remarkable feature 
is the presence of the lowest negative values of the SEOP 
function at the left-hand border of the central part of the 
section. In particular, the largest negative SEOP nucleus, 
located between 40 and 70 m along the horizontal profile, 
appears to propagate well beyond the impermeable sheet. 
The conclusion is thus that the pollutant solutes may have 
overstepped the barrier, though limited to a short distance 
thanks to the low permeability nature of the sandy-clayey 
hosting deposit. 

CONCLUSION 

 
An overview of the tomographic interpretation method in 
engineering geophysics has been given. Two approaches 
have been outlined, namely the deterministic tomography 
(DT)  inversion,  developed  for  acoustic  velocity  analysis 
in  rocks,  and  the  probability  tomography  (PT)  imaging 
developed for electrical resistivity analysis in the subsoil. 
The  theoretical  principles  of  both  approaches  have  been 
briefly reported and two case-studies have been analysed 
in order to demonstrate the highest resolution power that 
tomography provides in geophysics.

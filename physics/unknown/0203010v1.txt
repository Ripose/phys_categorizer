ABSTRACT

The  basic  theory  underlying  the  realization  of  simple  multiple-band
non-homogeneous  dielectric  resonators,  whose  spectral  response  is  the
overlap  of  single-resonator  frequency  bands,  is  developed  exploiting  a
general  approach  discussed  in  the  previous  companion  paper.  The  limit
frequencies  of  the  proposed  devices,  given  only  by  the  dielectric
properties  of  the  involved  materials,  can  differ  in  principle  by  several
decades. Experimental confirmations have been obtained on a composite
structure  built  up  with  teflon  and  polyethylene;  as  predicted  by  the
theory, the overall band includes frequencies which range about from 20
GHz  to  more  than  400  GHz,  when  high  frequency  resonances  are
selectively  excited.  The  localization  of  the  higher  frequency  radiation

1.   Introduction

Whispering  gallery  dielectric  resonators  (WGDRs)  form  a  class  of
rotationally invariant resonant structures, typically characterized by high
values of the azimuthal index  n; they exhibit then a multiplicity of sharp
resonances  and  can  be  considered  wideband  resonators  since  their
frequency  band  is  in  general  much  greater  than  the  free  spectral  range.
WGDR  appears  as  a  natural  candidate  for  the  realization  of  an  ultra-
wideband resonant structure, in addition to the broad field of applications
that these simple resonators have been applied to [1-7].

The  limit  properties  of  planar  homogeneous  WGDRs  have  been
discussed  in  the  companion  paper  [8],  with  particular  regard  to  their
frequency  response;  although  very  wide  in  principle,  the  obtainable
frequency  band  is  severely  limited  by  the  presence  of  transverse  modes,
that  in  a  homogeneous  structure  behave  as  the  fundamental  ones.  The
selective excitation of a specific family of mode is then quite difficult, so
uppw ,  see  Ref.
that  the  effective  frequency  band  (ranging  from 
[8]) is limited at least by a factor 3 in terms of decades in comparison to
the  ideal  frequency  band  (ranging  from 
maxw ),  calculated  for
fundamental  modes  only.  Moreover,  the  realization  of  a  homogeneous
ultra-wideband  WGDR  is  limited  by  practical  reasons,  owing  to  the
difficulty  to  find  a  dielectric  material  transparent  over  the  whole  ideal
band.  A  solution 
limitations  of  a
homogeneous  WGDR  is  obtained  coupling  different  WGDRs,  taking
advantage  from  their  open  structure,  in  which  no  metallic  shields  are
necessary.  The  inhomogeneity  in  the  dielectric  properties  of  the
composite  structure  induces  a  differentiation  in  the  properties  of  their
resonance  modes,  that  can  be  in  turn  selectively  excited.  As  a
consequence,  the  spectral  response  of  a  composite  WGDR  results  the
overlap  of  the  spectral  responses  of  the  employed  components.  In  order
to  limit  the  irradiation  losses,  a  geometry  preserving  the  cylindrical
symmetry is preferable; by this way the scattering of radiation due to the
inhomogeneity  along  the  azimuthal  direction  is  avoided.  A  simple
composite  structure  that  meets  these  requirements  is  represented  by  the
already  studied  stacked  configuration  [9,  10].  The  analysis  of  the
working  principles  of  basic  stacked  configurations  together  with  a
preliminary  experimental  characterization  represent  the  main  aim  of  this
paper.

the  ideal  limits  proper  of  the  involved  dielectric  materials.  The  partially
coupled configuration represents the starting point for the analysis of the
fully  coupled  WGDR,  studied  in  Sect.  4.  In  subsection  4a  it  is
demonstrated  that  this  configuration  can  reach  the  high  frequency  ideal
limit  only  by  a  selective  excitation  of  resonances;  possible  selection
mechanisms among modes are then discussed in subsection 4b. In Sect. 5
a fully coupled WGDR built up with teflon and polyethylene is designed
and  experimentally  characterized;  the  results  obtained  in  the  low
frequency  region  are  discussed  in  subsection  5a,  while  the  results
concerning  the  high  frequency  region  are  discussed  in  subsection  5b.
Finally, possible applications are suggested in Sect. 6, together with some
concluding remarks.

2.   Generalities

the 

spatial  behavior  of 

the  polarization  and 

The  basic  information  about  the  resonance  modes  of  a  WGDR
concerns 
their
electromagnetic fields. The modes are typically collected in two different
families,  whose  elements  are  labeled  as  WGEn,m,l  and  WGHn,m,l;  the
WGE  family  includes  quasi-transverse  electric  modes,  while  the  WGH
family  includes  quasi-transverse  magnetic  modes.  The  modal  indices
have the following meaning:  n, the azimuthal index, gives the number of
wavelengths  in  a  whole  turn  around  the  resonator;  m,  the  radial  index,
gives  the  number  of  nodes  of  the  energy  flux  along  the  radius  of  the
resonator, and l, the axial index, gives the number of nodes of the energy
flux  along  the  axis  of  the  resonator.  The  same  nomenclature  holds  for
resonators  obtained  from  the  stacked  composition  of  different  planar
WGDRs,  whose  simpler  implementations  are  reported  in  Fig.  1.  In
particular,  Fig.  1a  depicts  a  “partially  coupled”  stacked  WGDR,  while
Fig.  1b  depicts  a  “fully  coupled”  stacked  WGDR.  In  the  following,  the

The analysis of the composite WGDR will be focused on the behavior
of transverse axial modes (l „
 0,  m = 0); high frequency resonances with
m  „
  0  can  be  suppressed  making  a  central  hole  in  the  inner  disc  [11],
while  low  frequency  radial  modes  can  be  suppressed  with  a  suitable
choice of the geometry [8].

3.   Partially coupled multiple-band WGDR

Let us first consider the arrangement of Fig. 1a, where the outer discs
are  not  in  contact  with  the  central  one.  With  a  suitable  choice  of  the
thickness of the different regions, the central disc can be decoupled from
the lateral ones in a proper high frequency band, while it can be strongly
coupled  in  a  proper  low  frequency  band.  With  these  assumptions,  the
central  region  behaves  as  an  isolated  resonator  and  the  ideal  limit  wmax,
fixed by its dielectric losses, can be reached. If the high frequency band
is  assumed  centered  around  wHF ( £ wmax),  the  thickness  of  this  region
will  results  of  the  order  of  the  wavelength  in  the  medium  l HF=l(wHF)
[8].  Analogously,  the  inner  resonator  can  be  decoupled  from  the  outer
discs  if  the  gap  between  the  central  region  and  the  lateral  ones  is  of  the
order of l HF or greater.

On the other side, the whole structure behaves as a single resonator in
the frequency band around  wLF, provided that:  a) its total thickness is of
the order of  l LF=l(wLF), and  b)  the  dielectric  inhomogeneity  introduces
weak  perturbations  in  the  modes  of  a  resonator  having  identical  overall
latter
dimensions  and  homogeneous  dielectric  constant  e2.  This 
requirement,  equivalent  to  l LF >>lHF,  holds  when  l LF >10 lHF,  as
verified  by  the  theoretical  approach  discussed  in  [10].  The  spectral
response  of  this  composite  resonator  can  be  then  given  by  the  overlap

between  the  frequency  band  of  the  inner  resonator  and  the  frequency
band  of  the  whole  (homogeneous)  structure,  the  minimum  separation
between these bands being given by the previous inequality.

The  materials  which  form  the  different  parts  of  a  partially  coupled
resonator  can  be  chosen  without  any  constraint  on  their  dielectric
properties (provided that the consistence condition  wmax>wmin is satisfied
in each region). When the employed dielectric constants are different, the
considerations  made  in  [8]  hold  in  a  generalized  form.  The  limit
frequencies  for  fundamental  modes  are  obtained,  analogously  to  the
procedure of Sect. 3 in Ref  [8], from the equations

4.   Fully coupled multiple-band WGDR

The  structure  shown  in  Fig.  1a  can  be  modified  into  a  fully  coupled
WGDR,  represented  in  Fig  1b;  the  working  principles  of  the  latter
configuration are more complicated in comparison to those of a partially
coupled  WGDR,  since  the  different  parts  are  now  coupled  even  in  the
high frequency region.

4a.  Working principles
A  qualitative  but  physically  transparent  explanation  of  the  working
principles  of  fully  coupled  resonators  can  be  obtained  in  terms  of  the
geometrical  optics  representation,  that  applies  to  WGDRs  under  general
  the  modes  that  are  not  confined  in  the
conditions  [12].  When 
inner  region  propagate  in  the  outer  discs  with  lower  axial  propagation
constant, analogously to the plane waves refraction [10]. In general, some
of  these  modes  will  be  confined  by  the  outer  plane  surfaces  of  the
structure,  while  the  remaining  ones  will  be  axially  irradiated.  As  a
consequence,  modes  with  lower  axial  indices  (i.e.  with  lower  axial
propagation  constants)  can  be  confined  in  the  inner  disc,  modes  with
intermediate  axial  indices  are  distributed  in  the  whole  structure,  while
modes with higher axial indices are axially irradiated. If on the contrary
e£e
,  the  total  reflection  cannot  occur  in  the  inner  region  and  all
1
modes are distributed over the whole structure.

theoretical  approach  discussed 

The  previous  considerations  can  be  formalized  in  the  framework  of
the 
in  [10],  by  which  resonance
frequencies  and  fields  distribution  for  each  resonance  mode  can  be
calculated. As an illustrative example, calculations have been performed
around 240 GHz on a structure formed by a central disc 1 mm thick and
16 mm in diameter, having e1=4.5, placed between two equal discs 5 mm
thick and having  e2=2.  The  resonances  lying  inside  a  free  spectral  range
of  the  fundamental  modes  are  compared  with  those  of  a  homogeneous
resonator  with  identical  overall  dimensions  and  e =2.  For  sake  of
simplicity  only  modes  of  the  form  WGHn,0,l  were  investigated;  similar
results  hold  for  the  WGE  family.  The  behavior  of  the  modes  can  be
conveniently  discussed  in  terms  of  their  tangential  phase  velocity  vj(r),
here calculated in correspondence of the rim of the resonator, where the
excitation is typically localized; it results that [12]

phase  velocity  proper  of  the  outer  discs.  Finally,  starting  from  l=3  the
modes  are  distributed  on  the  whole  structure,  so  their  phase  velocity  is

transition  between  modes  confined  in  the  inner  disc  and  modes
distributed on the whole structure can be regulated varying the thickness
of  the  inner  region;  in  particular,  for  a  suitably  thin  inner  disc  only  the
mode with  l=0  is  confined.  Similar  results  hold  for  modes  with  index
m„ 0.

As  a  conclusion,  in  the  fully  coupled  WGDR  the  presence  of
transverse  modes  is  intrinsic  of  the  structure,  so  that  the  achievement  of
the  maximum  working  frequency  necessarily  requires  a  selective
excitation  of  modes  confined  in  the  inner  region.  Under  this  condition,
the  behavior  of  a  fully  coupled  WGDR  simply  reduces  to  that  of  a
partially coupled WGDR.

The  following  subsection  is  devoted  to  the  analysis  of  the  e.m.

excitation of non-homogeneous WGDRs.

4b.  Selective excitation of modes
The  coupling  of  e.m.  radiation  from  a  guiding  structure  to  a  WGDR
can  be  analyzed  in  general  way  by  means  of  the  coupled  mode  theory
[13,  14].  In  this  approach  the  fraction  of  power  transferred  to  the
resonator  is  given  by  the  product  of  two  factors:  an  overlap  integral
involving the mode propagating in the guiding structure and the mode of
the  WGDR,  both  normalized,  and  a  gaussian  function  of  the  difference
between  the  longitudinal  propagation  constant 
wgb   in  the  guiding
structure  and  the  transverse  propagation  constant  in  the  resonator  [15,
16].  The  selective  excitation  of  resonances  can  then  be  based  on  two
parameters, namely their spatial extension and their propagation constant.
Modes  confined  in  the  inner  region  are  favored  if  the  transverse
extension of the mode propagating in the guiding structure is not greater
than  the  thickness  of  the  inner  region;  indeed  in  this  case  the  overlap
integral for modes distributed over the whole structure decreases with the
ratio  between  the  thickness  of  the  inner  region  and  the  total  thickness,
wgb  must be equal to
respectively. Analogously, the propagation constant

When only resonance modes confined in the inner region are excited,
the  fully  coupled  multiple-band  WGDR  behaves  as  a  partially  coupled
one, so that Eqs. 1-3 apply. Analogously, in this condition the analysis of
the related merit factors can be developed following the subsection 4a.

5.   Preliminary experimental results

As a practical rule, when a multiple-band WGDR is designed, first the
frequencies of interest must be fixed; the materials forming their different
parts can then be chosen with suitable dielectric properties, so the relative
maximum  and  minimum  allowed  radius  follows  from  Eqs.  1  and  2.  The
radius  r  of  the  structure  can  be  finally  chosen  among  the  common
allowed values.

As  preliminary  experimental  verification,  a  fully  coupled  composite
teflon  was
resonator  made  with  high  density  polyethylene  and 
investigated  in  the  bands  around  20  GHz  and  400  GHz,  using  a

essentially flat over all the whole frequency range of interest  [19].  From
measurements  of  merit  factors  of  polyethylene  WGDRs,  it  follows  that
tan d  is better than 6*10-4  around  20  GHz  and  of  the  order  of  3*10-4
around  400  GHz.  For  teflon, 
  can  be  safely  assumed  in  the
considered  frequency  range  [20];  its  loss  angle  at  20  GHz  has  been
measured  and  results  about  equal  to  that  of  polyethylene,  while  in  the
high  frequency  region  it  is  about  three  times  greater.  A  multiple-band
WGDR  having  outer  discs  of  teflon  and  a  central  ring  of  polyethylene
can  be  then  realized.  The  radius  of  this  resonator,  according  to  the
discussion  at  the  beginning  of  this  section,  was  chosen  equal  to  30  mm.
The thickness t of the different parts, chosen in order to sustain few axial
modes in the related frequency band, can be evaluated from the condition

Since  the  high  frequency  modes  distributed  over  the  whole  structure
are  expected  to  be  hardly  excited,  owing  to  the  joint  effect  of  a  lower
overlap  integral  and  a  lower  merit  factor,  the  upper  working  frequency

around 400 GHz modes with axial indices  l=0,1  and  with  radial  indices

5a.  Low frequency characterization
The  low  frequency  characterization  of  the  investigated  resonator  was
made  in  the  frequency  range  18-28  GHz.  A  fused  quartz  cylindrical  rod
was  used  as  exciting  waveguide  in  the  so-called  reaction  configuration,
the excitation of the WGDR being obtained by means of the evanescent
field  that  surrounds  the  waveguide  [12].  A  schematic  view  of  the
experimental setup is reported in Fig. 4.

Fig.  5  shows  the  absorption  spectrum  of  the  fundamental  WGEn,0,0
modes  of  the  resonator.  Similar  results  were  obtained  for  WGHn,0,0
modes.  The  Q  of  the  observed  resonances  rapidly  decreases  with  the
frequency, owing to the irradiation losses, being its value around  minn
 of
the order of 50. As expected, also the coupling efficiency decreases with
the frequency [17]. The critical coupling in Fig. 5 is reached between the
resonances  labeled  6  and  7,  so  the  amplitude  of  the  next  peaks  in  the
absorption  curve  decreases.  For  frequencies  approaching  the  lower  limit
of the considered interval the resonances become unresolved, confirming
the estimation of the lower limit frequency of the investigated resonator.

The  irradiation  losses  of  planar  homogeneous  structures  can  be
quantified using the characteristic equation of a cylindrical waveguide in
the  limit  of  negligible  axial  propagation  constant,  consistently  with  the
approximation made in Sect. 3 of Ref.  [8].  In  this limit the characteristic
equation splits in two different equations (one for WGE modes, the other
for  WGH  modes),  containing  the  frequency  and  the  parameters  of  the
resonator; 
the  resonance
frequency and the relative merit factor. Fig. 6 reports the calculated and

calculated  at  the  critical  coupling,  and  the  stars  the  measured  values.
Interpolation lines are also reported.

To take into account the effect of the coupling on the merit factor, for
simplicity  all  resonances  have  been  considered  critically  coupled;  more
accurate  calculations  can  be  done  following  the  modeling  described  in
Ref.  [21].  The  analysis  of  several  other  configurations  (with  different
dielectric constant), confirms that the expected Q value near  nmin is of the
order  of  some  tens;  in  addition,  the  Q  increase  exponentially  with  the
frequency and the rate of increase strongly increases with eint.

Fig. 7 High-frequency absorption spectra of WGH mode. Identical arrows

represent a tentative assignment of modes belonging to the same family.

The experimental setup, optimized to work till to 450 GHz, is similar
to  that  sketched  in  Fig.  4,  the  only  significant  difference  being  the
reduced diameter of the exciting waveguide, now of the order of 0.5 mm.
The investigated frequency interval ranges from about 355 GHz to about
405 GHz.

Fig. 7 reports the absorption spectra of WGH  modes obtained around
357  GHz  and  around  403  GHz,  over  intervals  greater  than  the  free
spectral  range;  similar  results  were  obtained  for  WGE  modes.  Several
families of resonances are excited; identical arrows in Fig. 7 represent a
tentative assignment of modes belonging to the same family. The relative
merit  factor  is  of  the  order  of  3000,  as  expected  from  the  loss  angle  of
polyethylene  at  these  frequencies.  The  resulting  free  spectral  range  is
about the same for the different families. Around 403 GHz the spectrum
of  the  composite  resonator,  although  more  dense  than  that  obtained
around 355 GHz, is still resolved, since only some of the allowed modes
are effectively excited.

A  full  confirmation  of  the  proposed  theoretical  model  was  obtained
investigating  the confinement of  the  e.m.  field  in the inner polyethylene
ring.  To  this  purpose  an  additional  receiving  antenna  characterized  by  a
sharp  tip  [12]  was  moved  parallelly  to  the  axis  of  the  resonator  (z

GHz is reported in Fig. 8.

356.5 GHz resonance, measured near the rim.

The  occurrence  of  a  main  peak  centered  around  the  inner  region
(delimited  by  dashed  lines  in  Fig.  8)  confirms  that  the  small  difference
between  the  dielectric  constant  of  polyethylene  and  that  one  of  teflon
confines the high frequency mode with  l=0. The secondary peaks in Fig.
8 represent transverse modes of the whole structure not correlated to the
main one, as verified by changing the position of the exciting waveguide.
Indeed, while the main peak disappears for excitation outside the central
region,  the  secondary  ones  are  always  present.  The  presence  of  these
peaks  also  explain  the  asymmetry  observed  in  the  field  profile  of  the
main mode.

6.   Conclusions and possible applications

The  realization  of  an  ultra-wideband  resonator  is  an  appealing  and
very promising challenge. In this paper it is proposed and experimentally
characterized  a  very  simple  composite  WGDR  whose  effective  band
includes frequencies differing at least by a factor 20. The obtained results
substantiate  the  theory,  developed  here  and  in  the  companion  paper,
which  foresees  working  frequencies  only  limited  by  the  dielectric
properties  of  the  employed  materials;  with  a  suitable  choice  of  these

15
G. Annino et al.

materials, the allowed frequencies can differ by several decades, also for
slight  inhomogeneity  in  the  dielectric  properties  of  the  composite
structure.

The  peculiar  characteristics  of  the  proposed  devices  make  accessible
novel  experimental  methodologies.  A  sample  placed  inside  the  inner
region  of  a  composite  WGDR  can  be  simultaneously  submitted  to  e.m.
fields  having  very  different  frequencies;  the  study  of  double  resonance
phenomena  or  multi-photon  transitions  is  then  allowed  with  all  the
advantages  of  an  open  structure  resonator  and  without  its  usual  band
limitations.  The  characterization  of  the  excited  states  of  a  sample
represents, for instance, a natural application of multiple-band WGDRs.

A  novel  attention  should  be  also  paid  to  the  media  characterized  by
non-linear  electrodynamic  properties  (see,  for  instance,  Ref.  [22])  that,
used  in  conjunction  with  the  proposed  devices,  could  lead  to  the
realization of versatile tunable sources. On the other side, the generation
of  high  order  harmonics  in  a  non-linear  medium  experiencing  a  single
low  frequency  radiation  can  be  optimized  employing  a  composite
resonator  as  a  high  order  filter.  The  non-linear  behavior  is  also
characteristic of a multiple-band WGDR whose inner region includes an
active  medium  for  the  high  frequency  radiation,  as  obtained  when  the
inner  disc  is  a  quantum  cascade  laser  [3];  the  whole  composite  WGDR
can be designed to operate itself as a lower frequency laser excited by an
‘intracavity optical pumping’.

Finally, the concept of a dielectric resonator showing a multiple-band
spectral  response  can  be  generalized  increasing  the  number  of  nested
regions.

Abstract 

The LIGO Control and Data system (CDS) features a 
tightly  coupled  and  highly  integrated  control  and  data 
acquisition  system.  Control  of  the  interferometers 
requires many Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) 
control  loops  closed  both  locally  and  across  the  4-
kilometer  interferometer  arm  lengths.  In  addition  to 
providing  the  closed  loop  control,  the  control  systems 
front  end  processors  act  as  Data  Collection  Units 
(DCU)  for  the  data  acquisition  system.  Data  collected 
by  these  front  ends  and  the  data  acquisition  system 
must be collected and time stamped to an accuracy of 1 
microsecond  and  made  available  to  on-line  analysis 
tools such as the Global Diagnostics System (GDS)[1]. 
Data  is  also  sent  to  the  LIGO  Data  Analysis  System 
(LDAS)[2] for long-term storage and off-line analysis. 
Data 
rates  exceed  5  Mbytes  per  second  per 
interferometer  continuous.  Connection  between  the 
various  front  end  processors  and  the  data  acquisition 
system is achieved using fiber optic reflective memory 
networks.  Both  controls  and  data  acquisition  systems 
use VME hardware and VxWorksﬁ operating systems. 
This paper will present an overview of the LIGO CDS 
and discuss key aspects of its design. 

1 INTRODUCTION 
  The  LIGO  interferometers  located  in  Hanford, 
Washington  and  Livingston,  Louisiana  are  Michelson 
laser  interferometers  enhanced  by  multiple  coupled 
optical resonators. These coupled optical resonators are 
4-kilometer  long  Fabry-Perot  cavities  placed  in  each 
arm  of  the  interferometer.    The  mirrors  that  form  the 
cavities  are  suspended  from  a  single  loop  of  wire 
mounted  inside  suspension  cages  that  are  mounted  on 
seismically  isolated  optical  platforms within the LIGO 
vacuum system.   
  The  Control  and  Data  System  (CDS)  for  these 
interferometers must provide many features. Among the 
requirements are: 

•  Provide  for  monitoring  and  control  of  the 
vacuum  systems  in  which  the  interferometers 
reside.   

•  Provide  for  continuous  data  acquisition  at 

rates to 5Mbyte/sec per interferometer. 

•  Provide  for 

interferometer  diagnostics 

to 
monitor  interferometer  systems  and  measure 
interferometer performance. 

•  Provide  for  local  damping  of  all  suspended 

optics. 

•  Provide for pitch and yaw (alignment) control 

of all suspended optics.

number  of  half-wavelengths  of  the  laser  light 
(λ  =  1.06µm)  with  high  accuracy,  ranging 
from nm to less than 0.1pm. 

•  Provide  the  integration  mechanisms  to  bring 
the  system  from  a  group  of  individually 
damped mirrors to a locked interferometer [4] 
with a strain sensitivity of 10-21/√Hz.

The  interferometer  itself  consists  of  a  pre-stabilized 
laser  (PSL),  a  mode  cleaner  with  seven  suspended 
optics,  and  five  large  core  optics.    The  core  optics 
consist  of  a  recycling  mirror,  beam  splitter,  two  input 
test masses and two end test masses. 

The  LIGO  laser  is  designed  as  a  Non-Planar  Ring 
Oscillator  (NPRO)  in  a  Master  Oscillator  Power

At  the  output  of  the  PSL,  a  mode  cleaner,  mode 
matching  telescopes  and  steering  mirrors  are  provided 
to  direct  the  beam  into  the  interferometer.  For  these 
optics,  as  well  as  the  core  optics,  CDS  provides  for 
local damping, alignment and length control. 

2.2 Building Blocks 

In general, the CDS front end controls are based on 
VME  systems.  To  the  extent  possible,  Commercial, 
Off-The-Shelf  (COTS)  VME  modules  are  employed. 
Custom  VME  module  designs  are  primarily  limited  to 
timing  system  interfaces.  A  basic  block  diagram  of  a 
typical  VME  subsystem  is  shown  in  the  following 
figure.

applications 

communication 

 
Processors in the VME systems are of two types: 1) 
Motorola  MVME162,  for  slow  (<10Hz)  control  and 
operator 
2) 
PentiumIII  processors,  for  real-time  Digital  Signal 
Processing (DSP) applications (to 16KHz). In the case 
of  the  high  bandwidth  servo  applications,  both  an 
MVME-162  and  DSP  will  reside  in  the  same  VME 
crate. The MVME-162 performs the task of interfacing 
information  between  operator  stations,  via  the  CDS 
ATM  network,  and  the  DSP,  via  the  VME  backplane. 
The DSP only connects to the CDS ATM network for 
purposes of downloading software. 

VME  I/O  modules  are  comprised  primarily  of 
Analog to Digital Converters (ADC), Digital to Analog 
Converters  (DAC)  and  binary  input/output  modules. 
All  ADC  and  DAC  are  simultaneous  sampling  16  bit 
devices, with eight individual ADC and DAC per VME 
module.  

 

Timing  clocks  for  controls  and  data  acquisition  are 
derived  from  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS).  A 
commercial GPS receiver was developed for LIGO that 
provides a 222Hz clock output, phase locked to the GPS 
1Hz  clock.  LIGO  custom  timing  boards  to  clock  and 
synchronize  all  of  the  LIGO  control  systems  and  data 
acquisition system distribute the 1Hz and 222Hz clocks. 
For interfacing to the various interferometer sensors 
and actuators, a large number of custom modules were 
developed in 6U Eurocard format for installation in 19(cid:148) 
rack  mount  Eurocard  chassis.    Types  of  modules 
designed 
include  whitening/dewhitening 
I&Q 
filters, 
demodulators.    Several  closed  loop  controls  are  also 
performed  in  analog  circuitry  or  analog  circuitry 
combined  with  digital  controls.  Examples  include  the 
pre-stabilized laser and mode cleaner controls.

and 

For communications between the various processors 
involved in control and data acquisition, three networks 
are provided: 
•  CDS  Asynchronous  Transfer  Mode 

(ATM) 
network. This network consists of an ATM switch 
with  direct  connection  to  operator  stations  and 
servers and uplinks to Ethernet switches at various 
locations  for  connection  to  the  VME  processors. 
This  network  is  used  for  downloading  code  to 
VME  processors  and  communicating  information 
between  operator 
the  VME 
stations 
processors. 

and 

•  Data  Acquisition  Network.  This  network  is  based 
on 1Gbit/sec reflected memory, with up to 4Mbyte 
of memory per node.  

•  Control  Reflected  Memory  (RFM)  network.  This 
network  is  based  on  240Mbit/sec,  64Mbyte  per 
node,  reflected  memory.  This  network  is  used  for 
real-time communication between DSPs. The RFM 
interface  modules  directly  connect  to  the  DSP  as 
PCI Mezzanine Cards (PMC). 

Backend  computers  and  servers  are  typically  Sun 
Microsystems  workstations  and  servers.  These  are 
employed  as  operator  stations,  system  servers,  file 
servers, and for interferometer diagnostic data analysis.   
is  based  on 
operational  requirements.  For  all  real-time  DSP 
applications,  code  is  developed  in  C  and  runs  on  the 
vxWorksﬁ operating system on VME based PentiumIII 
processors.   

Software  development 

for  CDS 

For  general  network  communications  and  slow 
controls, 
the  Experimental  Physics  and  Industrial 
Control  System  (EPICS),  first  developed  at  Los 
Alamos  National  Laboratory,  is  used.    The  primary 
features  of  EPICS  used  in the LIGO CDS are channel 
access,  used  to  communicate  information  between 
operators  and  the  VME  processors,  the  graphical  user 

interface 
displays, and the back up and restore tools. 

features, 

for  development  of  operator 

For IFO diagnostic analysis and data display, code is 
developed in C++ for a ROOT based system originally 
developed at CERN. 

2.2 Vacuum Controls 

The  vacuum  chambers,  vacuum  tubes,  vacuum 
pumping and all associated sensors and actuators were 
designed,  built  and 
installed  under  contract  by 
commercial  vendors.  LIGO  provided  the  control  and 
monitoring  systems.    This  system  was  designed  as  a 
stand-alone system, with three 19(cid:148) racks of equipment 
in  the  corner  station  and  one  in  each  mid  and  end 
station.    The  controls  are  VME  based,  using  MVME-
162 processor boards running EPICS software.  

Actual  monitoring  and  control  is  provided  by 
software  written  using  the  EPICS  State  Notation 
Language (SNL) feature.  For each type of device to be 
controlled and/or monitored, a generic EPICS database 
and SNL program was developed and tested, much like 
a C++ object.  A PERL script was then used to generate 
the  unique  instances  required  by  each  VME  processor 
in the system.  A second script generates a startup file 
based  on  the  contents  of  this  directory.  The  file  is 
loaded by the VME processor on power up or reset.   

2.3 Laser  Controls 

The  commercial  laser  system  is  refined  in  both 
amplitude  and 
frequency  stability  by  dedicated 
feedback  controls.  The  entire  system  is  referred  to  as 
the  Pre-Stabilized  Laser  (PSL).  An  overview  of  the 
PSL is shown in the following figure.

The  amplitude  stabilization  servo  was  implemented 
to  provide  up  to  80  dB  of  suppression  of  amplitude 

 

jitter  inherent  to  the  laser  output.  Both  the  frequency 
and  amplitude  stabilization  are  fully  controllable 
through  remote  user  interfaces.  Additional  amplitude 
stabilization  and  isolation  of  the  fundamental  optical 
mode is provided by the pre-modecleaner servo, which 
functions  analogously  to  a  tracking  band-pass  optical 
filter.  

2.4 Interferometer Controls 

The interferometer controls that provide for the local 
damping  of  optics  (Digital  Suspension  Controls 
(DSC))[4], Alignment Sensing and Control (ASC) and 
interferometer  Length  Sensing  and  Control  (LSC)  are 
provided  by  MIMO  digital  servo  controllers.  All  of 
these  control  subsystems  share  common  design 
features.

Each of these digital control systems (DCS) consists 
of  a  VME  crate  with  two  CPUs,  one  DSP  and  one 
MVME-162  processor  running  EPICS  (EP).    The 
EPICS  CPU  has  a  database  for  communicating 
to/from  operators,  with  SNL  code 
information 
providing 
the  EPICS 
database  records  and  the  DSP.    Essentially,  this  SNL 
code  reads/writes  local  memory  mapped  to  the  VME 
backplane. The DSP updates this memory at 16Hz. The 
DSP  closed  loop  control  code  runs  at  either  16384Hz 
or  2048Hz,  dependent  on 
the  servo  bandwidth 
requirements.  

communications  between 

While  the  software  for  each  DCS  requires  some 
custom  software  particular  to  the  application,  a  fairly 
standard pattern for control is consistent in all units and 
code  libraries  have  been  written  for  these  standard 
features.  The standard software design is shown in the 
following figure.

Servo Filter Bank 

 
As  required,  each  input  sensor  signal  is  provided 
with  a  gain  and  phase  shift  block,  settable  by  the 
operator. Some controllers require switchable hardware 
whitening  filters.    As  these  are  switched  in  and  out, 
software  filters  must  also  be  switched  to  compensate 
for the hardware and maintain loop stability.  

The input signals are then passed to an input matrix.  
The matrix parameters can be set by operators, or, as in 
the  case  of  the  LSC,  this  matrix  can  be  automatically 
adjusted based on input parameters.  

The  actual  servo  calculation  filter  banks  follow  the 
input matrix.  These filter banks contain as many as ten 
  An  output  matrix  and  dewhitening 
filters  each. 
compensation  filters  follow  the  filter  bank.  In  some 
cases, the output matrix is actually a matrix of filters. 

All of the digital filters in these systems are based on 
second  order  section  (SOS)  IIR  filters.  A  filter  bank 
consists of: 
•  A primary input, with gain and offset adjusts. 
•  An  auxiliary  input  for  insertion  of  excitation 

signals from the GDS. 

•  Up to 10 filter sections, each of which may be up 

to an 8th order filter. 
•  An output inverter stage. 
•  An output enable/disable. 

Initially,  the  filter  coefficients  were  evolved  from 
modeling  of  system  requirements  and  then  placed  in 
code  header files.  As is typical, during interferometer 
commissioning it was found that the theoretical models 
and real world did not exactly match and the changing 
of  filter  coefficients  became  common.    Therefore,  the 
systems  have  evolved  to  writing  the  filter  coefficients 
to separate files, which are user modifiable, and can be 
uploaded  to  the  DCS.  This  is  done  in  such  a way that 
filters can be changed (cid:147)on the fly(cid:148), i.e. no task restart or 
CPU reboot is required. 

While  the  DSC,  ASC  and  LSC  are  individual 
subsystems of CDS, they must communicate with each 
other in real-time. Certain sensors are connected to one 
subsystem, but are also required by another subsystem 
and control outputs of the ASC and LSC must be fed to 
the  DSC  for  actual  output  to  the  optics.  The  sensors 
and  control  actuators  may  be  up  to  4-kilometers  away 
from  the  DSP  performing  the  servo  control  functions. 
To  facilitate  these  communications,  the  CDS  RFM 
control  network  is  used.  Each  interferometer  control 

 

three  of 

these  networks:  one 

system  has 
for 
communication  within  the  corner  station  and  one  for 
communication with each end station. The use of three 
networks  was  required  to  minimize  and  balance  the 
servo loop phase delay, as the speed to light to the end 
stations adds 13(cid:181)sec.  

3 DATA ACQUISITION  
The  LIGO  Data  Acquisition  System  (DAQS) 

provides several key functions:   
•  DAQS  must  acquire  data  from  digital  controllers 
and various analog signals from LIGO sensors and 
record  this  data  to  disk  for  consumption  by  the 
LIGO LDAS system for analysis.  

•  DAQS must broadcast acquired data to LIGO GDS 
computers for interferometer performance analysis 
and reduced data set writing.  

•  DAQS  provides  the  network  connections  between 
the  GDS  Arbitrary  Waveform  Generator  (AWG) 
and the digital controllers. 

•  DAQS  provides  for  data  transmission  to  operator 
stations and graphical tools to display the data. 
  An  outline  of  the  LIGO  DAQS  is  shown  in  the 
following figure.

    Input  to  the  DAQS  can  be  either  as  direct  analog 
input  signals,  via  the  Analog  Data  Collection  Units 
(ADCU)  or  as  digital  signals  from  the  various  LIGO 
digital servo controllers. These units are interconnected 
to  each  other  and  the  DAQ  controller  via  a  1Gbit/sec 
Reflected Memory (RFM) network.  Each processor on 
the network is assigned a defined block for transferring 
its  data  and  communicating  control  and  status 
information with the DAQS controller.   

  ADCUs  are  VME  crates  with  a  processor,  RFM 
network module, timing system connections, and up to 
five Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) modules. The 
ADC modules used in the system contain 32 individual, 
24-bit  sigma  delta  ADC  with  programmable  gains. 
Signals are connected to the ADCU via an anti-aliasing 
chassis,  which  contains  plug  in  filters  appropriate  for 
the  data  acquisition  rate  of  a  particular  channel.  
Acquisition  rates  are  selectable  from  256Hz  up  to 
16384Hz for each channel in steps of 2n.  

the  Arbitrary  Waveform  Generator 

The DAQS RFM network also provides a connection 
for 
(AWG), 
provided  as  part  of  GDS.    The  AWG  uses  the  DAQS 
RFM to inject excitation signals into defined points of 
the  digital  servo  controllers  or  can  directly  produce 
analog outputs via its own Digital to Analog Converters 
(DAC).  
  All  EPICS  channels  are  available  to  be  collected  by 
the  system  at  rates  to  16Hz.    As  part  of  the  DAQ 
controller VME crate, a second CPU, the EPICS Data 
Collection  Unit  (EDCU),  collects  requested  EPICS 
channels  and  stores  them  in  local  memory.    This 
memory is then read across the VME backplane by the 
DAQ controller for insertion into the main DAQS data 
stream.

The  primary  function  of  the  FrameBuilder  is  to 
format  the  data  into  LIGO  standard  data frame format 
and then store that data to disk.  The frame format is a 
standard adopted by the gravitational wave community 
for  the  sharing  of  data.    A  frame  contains  descriptor 
 

 

information on all of the data contained within a frame 
and  data  for  all  channels  acquired  in  a  given  time 
period.    At  present,  LIGO  is  producing  frames  that 
contain  16  seconds  of  data.  Data  written  to  disk  are 
kept  on  line  for  up  to  three  weeks  before  being 
archived by the LDAS. 

In addition to these frames, which contain all data in 
raw  format,  the  FrameBuilder  also  produces  what  are 
called  trend  frames.    These  are  files  that  contain 
statistical  information  about  the  data  channels,  at  one 
second, 1 minute and 1 hour intervals.  

For  delivery  of  data  to  operator  workstations,  the 
FrameBuilder  also  provides  a  Network  Data  Server 
(NDS).  The NDS provides data on request via a CDS 
defined  lightweight  protocol.    NDS  is  used  by  the 
DAQS data display software and GDS tools to retrieve 
information  from  the  DAQS.    Data  is  made  available 
near  real-time,  at  16Hz  update  rates,  or  from  LIGO 
data frames or trend files on disk. 

to 

The  FrameBroadcaster  produces  one  second  data 
frames.  However,  rather  than  storing  the  data  to  disk, 
this unit broadcasts data in frame format over a gigabit 
Ethernet.  This  information  is  then  received  by  several 
GDS  interferometer  diagnostic  computers,  which  use 
aspects  of 
the  data 
interferometer performance.  The data broadcast is also 
received  by  the  Reduced  Data  Set  (RDS)  writer.  This 
unit  records  subsets  of  data  and  also has the ability to 
store test point data, which is not recorded by the main 
FrameBuilder.  The  RDS  is  typically  used  to  record 
short  stretches  (hours)  of  data  for  off-line  analysis  in 
support of interferometer commissioning.

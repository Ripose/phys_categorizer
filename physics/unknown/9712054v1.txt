ABSTRACT

Motivated by the study of heterotic string compactiﬁcations on elliptically ﬁbered
Calabi-Yau manifolds, we present a procedure for testing semistability and identifying
the decomposition type of degree zero holomorphic vector bundles over a nonsingular
elliptic curve. The algorithm requires explicit knowledge of a basis of sections of an
associated ‘twisted bundle’.

1 Introduction

In the study of a certain class of heterotic string compactiﬁcations one encounters the
following:

Problem: Given a smooth elliptic curve E and a degree zero holomorphic vector
bundle V over E, ﬁnd a practical algorithm to determine whether V is semistable. In
this case, ﬁnd a maximal decomposition of V in indecomposable subbundles.

This question appeared in [1] in the course of an investigation of the relation between

(0, 2) heterotic string compactiﬁcations and F -theory.

Since the most accessible bundle data are usually its global holomorphic sections, we
will be interested in solving this problem by ﬁnding a characterization of semistability
and of the decomposition type in terms of properties of a basis of sections of a certain
bundle associated to V . Our main result is Theorem 2.2 in section 2.3.

Physical motivation: A (0, 2) heterotic compactiﬁcation is characterized by a
Calabi-Yau manifold Z and a stable holomorphic vector bundle V over Z [2]. If one
is interested in models having a potential F -theory dual [3, 4, 5], one takes Z to be
In this case, for a certain component of the
elliptically ﬁbered and with a section.
moduli space, there exists an alternate description of stable vector bundles over Z
in terms of pairs (Σ, L) where Σ is the spectral cover of V and L is a line bundle
over Σ [5, 6, 7]. Such data are easier to manipulate then the abstract bundle data.
On the other hand, there exists an accessible class of (0, 2) compactiﬁcations, namely
those realized via (0, 2) linear sigma models [8, 9, 10, 11]. In this case, V is presented
as the sheaf cohomology of a monad deﬁned over Z, while Z itself is realized as a
complete intersection in a toric variety [12]. This leads to the problem, studied in [1],
of translating between these alternative presentations of V in the (0, 2) linear case.
The main condition for V to admit a spectral cover description is that its restriction
V |E to the generic elliptic ﬁbre E of Z be semistable. In order to carry out the task
of [1], one needed a method to test this condition for a given bundle V . This proves
essential in organizing the wealth of models that can be built. An important point,
which was tangentially mentioned in [1], is that the above condition often fails to
hold, even for (0, 2) models which seem to be physically well-deﬁned. One also ﬁnds a
signiﬁcant number of models for which the condition is satisﬁed but V |E does not fully
decompose as a direct sum of line bundles. Discriminating between such cases can be
achieved by the methods of the present paper. On the other hand, the method of [1]
was justiﬁed only for the case when V |E is semistable and fully decomposable. Here
we remedy this by providing a systematic discussion of the general situation.

Mathematical context: The main results we need date back to a classical paper
of Atiyah [13] 1 . Fix a nonsingular elliptic curve E with a distinguished point p. Let
E(r, 0) be the set of (holomorphic equivalence classes of) indecomposable holomorphic
vector bundles of rank r and degree zero over E. Any element V ∈ E(r, 0) is of the
form V = L ⊗ Fr with L ∈ Pic0(E) a degree zero line bundle uniquely determined by

1Background material can be found for example in [14].

V and satisfying Lr = detV . Here Fr is the unique element of E(r, 0) with h0 6= 0.
One has h0(Fr) = 1. The bundles Fr can be deﬁned inductively by F1 := OE and by
the fact that Fr is the unique nontrivial extension :

0 −→ Fr−1 −→ Fr −→ OE −→ 0

of Fr−1 by OE. The Riemann-Roch theorem gives h1(Fr) = h0(Fr) = 1. It is known
that Fr is semistable for all r.

For any holomorphic vector bundle of degree zero and rank r over E, consider a

maximal decomposition as a direct sum of holomorphic subbundles:

If V is semistable, then we necessarily have degVj ≤ 0 for all j = 1..k and since
0 = degV = Pj=1..k degVj, it follows that degVj = 0 for all j. If rj := rankVj, we thus
have Vj ∈ E(rj, 0) and Vj = Lj ⊗ Frj , with Lj ∈ Pic0(E). Thus :

V = ⊕j=1..kVj

V = ⊕j=1..kLj ⊗ Frj

Note that Pj=1..k rj = r.

Conversely, if such a decomposition of V exists, then, since all terms are semistable
and of slope 0, a standard result (see [15, p17,Cor. 7]) assures us that V is semistable
and of degree zero. The idea of our approach will be to use (3) in order to simulta-
neously check semistability and determine the maximal decomposition, thus avoiding
the diﬃcult problem of testing semistability independently.

The sequence of pairs (rj, Lj)(j = 1..k) will be called the decomposition type (or
splitting type) of V . By using the distinguished point p ∈ E to write Lj ≈ O(qj − p)
for some qj ∈ E, we can identify this data with the sequence of pairs (rj, qj), modulo
the choice of p. Obviously the splitting type determines V up to isomorphism.

Part of this information is encoded by what we will call the spectral divisor ΣV of

V , deﬁned by :

ΣV := r1q1 + ... + rkqk ∈ Div(E)

Note that some of the points qj may coincide. If q1 = ... = qj1 := Q1 , ... , qj1+...+jl−1+1 =
.. = qj1+...+jl := Ql (with j1 + ... + jl = k), then ΣV = ρ1Q1 + ... + ρlQl where

In particular, ΣV cannot discriminate between direct factors of the type O(Q1)⊗(Fr1 ⊕

2Since the only stable bundles of slope zero over an elliptic curve are the degree zero line bundles, any
Jordan-Holder (JH) ﬁltration of V is by subbundles of consecutive dimension. The (isomorphism class of)
the associated graded bundle gr(V ) is independent of the choice of the JH ﬁltration. If V decomposes as
above, the natural JH ﬁltrations of Fri induce a JH ﬁltration of V in the obvious way. The associated graded
bundle is gr(V ) = O(Q1 − p)⊕ρ1 ⊕ ... ⊕ O(Ql − p)⊕ρl . Therefore, Σ depends only on gr(V ), i.e. only on the
S-equivalence class of V .

3

ΣV depends only on the S-equivalence class of V . Two degree zero semistable vector
bundles having the same spectral divisor need not have the same splitting type.

The explicit computation of ΣV was the main task of [1]. In that paper, a solution
of this problem was presented only for the ‘fully split’ case (this is rigorously formulated
in Section 3). A by-product of the study we undertake here is a simple generalization
of the method of [1] for determining the spectral divisor (see Corrolary 2.1 in section
2.3).

We will often consider the ‘twisted’ bundle V ′ := V ⊗ O(p), which has degree r and

slope 1. If V is semistable, one has the following

Lemma 1.1 Let V be a degree zero semistable vector bundle over E. Then h0(V ′) =
rankV and h1(V ′) = 0.

Proof: By (3), we have h0(V ′) = Pj=1..k h0(O(qj) ⊗ Frj ). Since O(qj) ⊗ Frj
is
indecomposable and of positive degree, a result of [13] shows that h0(O(qj) ⊗ Frj ) =
degO(qj) ⊗ Frj = rj and the Riemann-Roch theorem gives h1(O(qj) ⊗ Frj ) = 0. This
implies the conclusion. 2

As input data for the resolution of our problem we will assume explicit knowledge
of a basis of sections of V ′. This is typically easily computed, at least if V is presented
as the sheaf cohomology of a monad. 3

The plan of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we study semistability and the
decomposition type for a degree zero holomorphic vector bundle V over E. We formu-
late necessary and suﬃcient conditions on a basis of sections of V ′ in order for V to
be semistable; this will also indicate its decomposition type. In particular, we obtain
a simple receipt for the spectral divisor. We also consider the spectral divisor in the
monad case and propose a ‘moduli problem’.

In section 3 we consider the fully decomposable (‘fully split’) case. We present a
criterion for identifying fully decomposable and semistable vector bundles of degree zero
over E, together with an algorithmic implementation. This is the main case considered
in [1]. The novelty here is that the algorithm we give tests semistability of V (and at the
same time determines its spectral divisor and its decomposition type, thus describing
V completely in the language of [13]); in [1], the focus was on computing ΣV and V was
assumed to be semistable and fully decomposable in order to simplify the presentation.
We also explain how one can analyze V by starting from more general twists. This is
necessary in practice in cases when one cannot easily compute the sections of bundles
over E twisted by O(p). 4. With the physics oriented reader in mind, the discussion

3 Indeed, in that case one can consider the O(p)-twisted monad. The long exact cohomology sequence of

the twisted monad will collapse due to the fact that h1(V ′) = 0. This is one of the nice properties of V ′.

4In the set-up of [1], one is interested in smooth elliptic curves realized as complete intersections in a
toric variety P. In this case, one can easily compute the sections of V ⊗ LE, for restrictions LE of reﬂexive
sheaves L over P. If O(p) is not such a restriction then the sections of V ⊗ O(p) are not easily accessible.
For example, if E is realized as a cubic in P2
restricts to a degree three
line bundle O(p1 + p2 + p3) over E, and one can apply the methods of section 3 to the twisted bundle
V ′ := V ⊗ O(p1 + p2 + p3).

of section 3 is carried out by a direct approach and can be read independently of the
rest of the paper; it is intended as a technical companion of [1].

Notation and terminology: If s is a regular section of a holomorphic vector
bundle, then (s) denotes the zero divisor (divisor of zeroes) of s. Div(E) is the free
abelian group of divisors on E. If D ∈ Div(E), D = Pj=1..k njpj, with nj ∈ Z, pj ∈ E,
then suppD denotes the set {pj|j = 1..k}. All vector bundles and their morphisms are
holomorphic. For any vector space A, Grk(A) denotes the grassmanian of k-dimensional
subspaces of A. If S ∈ A is a subset, then < S > denotes the linear span of S. For
any holomorphic bundle R over E, Grk(R) denotes the set of rank k holomorphic
subbundles of R. ∼ denotes linear equivalence of divisors and Pic(E) the Picard group
of E. If r is an integer, then Picr(E) is the set of isomorphism classes of degree r line
bundles over E; it is only a subset of Pic(E), except for r = 0, when it is a subgroup.
We say that a ﬁltration 0 = K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Kr = U of an r-dimenisonal vector space
U is nondegenerate if Ki−1 6= Ki for all i = 1..r. Then Ki have consecutive dimensions.
For a holomorphic bundle V , we denote by µ(V ) := degV /rankV its slope (nomalized
degree).

Intuitive idea The starting point for our analysis is the fact that the twisted
bundles F ′
r are given recursively as nontrivial extensions of O(p) by itself. By Lemma
1.1, the associated cohomology sequences collapse and this provides a very good handle
on the behaviour of F ′
In terms of the local behaviour of sections, the diﬀerence
r.
between F ′
r and the completely trivial extension O(p)⊕r is manifest only at the point
p.
In both cases, the bundles admit a basis of r sections whose values are linearly
independent at each point of E except p. At this point, the behaviour in the two cases
is dramatically diﬀerent. While in the completely decomposable case the values of all
sections vanish simultaneously at p along linearly independent ‘directions’, in the case
of F ′
r only one of them vanishes, while the others have linearly independent values.
In the latter case, however, the ‘direction’ of the ﬁrst section approaches the space
spanned by the values of the others as we approach p on E, and at the point p it lies in
that space. The behaviour of the sections of V ′ can be obtained essentially by a ‘linear
superposition’ from the behaviour of its indecomposable factors. Most of what follows
consists in developing enough technology in order to make these ideas precise. This
being understood, the physics-oriented reader may at ﬁrst consider only the ﬁrst part
of subsection 2.1, the statements of Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in section 2 and of Theorem
3.1 in section 3 and the associated algorithm.

2 General analysis

Let V be a degree zero holomorphic vector bundle over a smooth elliptic curve E. Fix
a point p ∈ E and deﬁne V ′ := V ⊗ O(p).

We present a criterion for deciding whether V is semistable and, in this case, for
determining its splitting type. This criterion requires explicit knowledge of a basis of
holomorphic sections of V ′.

5

The plan of this section is as follows. In subsection 1 we discuss a notion of order
of incidence of a holomorphic section on a subbundle. Since this discussion does not
require assuming degV = 0, we will present it for a general holomorphic vector bundle
over E. In subsection 2 we use these concepts to describe the sections of the bundles
F ′
r. In subsection 3 we give our characterization of degree zero semistable bundles.

Incidence order of holomorphic sections on subbun-

2.1
dles

In this subsection let W be a rank r holomorphic vector bundle over E and let T be a
rank r0 holomorphic subbundle of W .

Any nonzero regular section of W deﬁnes a unique line subbundle Ls of W in the
following way (see [13]). For each t ∈ supp(s), choose a local holomorphic coordinate z
on E centered at t. Let νt be the degree of vanishing of s at t. Then ∃ lime→p z−νts(e) :=
ˆs(t), where ˆs(t) ∈ Wt − {0}. We deﬁne (Ls)e :=< s(e) >, for all e ∈ E − supp(s) and
:=< ˆs(t) > for all t ∈ supp(s). Note that changing the local holomorphic
(Ls)t
coordinate z to another local holomorphic coordinate z′ centered at t will change ˆs(t)
to ˆs′(t) = lime→p(z(e)/z′(e))νt ˆs(t). Thus, the vector ˆs(t) is deﬁned up to multiplication
by a nonzero complex number. In particular, (Ls)t is well-deﬁned. By using the local
triviality of W or by the argument given in [13], one can convince oneself that Ls is
a holomorphic subbundle of W . Note that Lλs = Ls, ∀λ ∈ C ∗, so that we have a
well-deﬁned map PH 0(W ) −→ Gr1(W ) from the projectivisation of H 0(W ) to the set
of holomorphic line subbundles of W .

Since s is a holomorphic section of Ls, it follows that Ls is holomorphically equiv-
alent to O(s), where O(s) is the line bundle on E associated to the divisor (s) =
Pt∈supp(s) νtt. In particular, we have degLs = deg(s) = Pt∈supp(s) νt = Pe∈E degs(e),
where we deﬁne degs(e) to be νe, if e ∈ supp(s) and 0 otherwise.

For each e ∈ E, we have a natural linear map φe : H 0(W ) −→ We given by
φe(s) := s(e), ∀s ∈ H 0(W ) (the evaluation map at e). We denote its image and kernel
by Re := φe(H 0(W )) ⊂ We, Ke := kerφe ⊂ H 0(W ) and we deﬁne re(W ) := dimCRe,
de(W ) := dimCKe. We have re(W ) + de(W ) = h0(W ) at any point e ∈ E.

Deﬁne a subspace Ne of We by Ne :=< {ˆs(e)|s ∈ Ke} >⊂ We (if s = 0, we deﬁne
ˆs(e) to be zero). It is easy to see that changing the linear coordinate z does not aﬀect
Ne. Note that Ne = Ps∈Ke (Ls)e. In general, the subspaces Ne, Re of We may intersect
and their sum need not generate We. Deﬁne Z(W ) := {t ∈ E|Kt 6= 0}.

If W is semistable then we must have degs = degLs ≤ µ(W ). Since s is regular, we
also have degs ≥ 0 . Then degs ∈ {0, .., [µ(W )]}, where [ ] denotes the integer part. In
particular, we have degs(e) ≤ µ(W ) for all e ∈ E.

Proposition 2.1 Suppose that W is semistable and of slope 1 . Let e ∈ E and ﬁx
a local coordinate z around e on E. Then the map s ∈ Ke → ˆs ∈ Ne is a C-linear
isomorphism. In particular, we have dimCNe = de.

6

Proof: By the above, we see that any s ∈ Ke − {0} must have a simple zero at
If s1, s2 ∈ Ke and α1, α2 ∈ C, let s := α1s1 + α2s2. Then ∃ lime′→e z−1s(e′) =
e.
α1ˆs1(e) + α2ˆs2(e). If α1ˆs1(e) + α2ˆs2(e) = 0, then s must be zero (otherwise s would
have degree > 1 at e). In this case ˆs(e) = 0 by deﬁnition. If α1ˆs1(e) + α2ˆs2(e) 6= 0,
then ˆs(e) = α1ˆs1(e) + α2ˆs2(e).

Thus in both cases we have ˆs(e) = α1ˆs1(e) + α2ˆs2(e), which shows linearity.
If
s ∈ Ke, then by deﬁnition ˆs(e) is zero only if s = 0. This shows injectivity. Surjectivity
is obvious. 2

What follows is a generalization of the previous classical discussion.

Deﬁnition 2.1 Let s ∈ H 0(W ) be a holomorphic section of W . Consider the holo-
morphic section s of the quotient bundle W/T , naturally induced by s. We say that s
is incident of order (degree) d on T at a point e ∈ E if s has a zero of order (exactly)
d at e. In this case, we write degT s(e) := d and we call it the incidence order(degree)
of s on T at e.

Note that we have s(e) ∈ Te iﬀ degT s(e) > 0. Intuitively, degT s(e) characterizes

‘how fast’ s(e′) ∈ We′ approaches the subspace Te′ of We′ as e′ approaches e on E.

If s ∈ H 0(T ) ⊂ H 0(W ), then s is identically zero, so the degree of incidence of s
on T is not deﬁned for such s at any point of E. If s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ), then s is
a nonzero section of W/T and the associated divisor (s) is a ﬁnite set of points of E.
Therefore, the set ZT (s) := {e ∈ E|degT s(e) > 0} = {e ∈ E|s(e) ∈ T } = supp(s) is
ﬁnite for all sections s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ). In particular, degT s(e) is well deﬁned in
this case at all points e ∈ E. Thus, for all s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ), we can deﬁne the total
degree of s along T by degT s := Pe∈Zs(T ) degT s(e) = degs.

For T = 0 (the null subbundle of W ) we have s = s so deg0s(e) = degs(e) and the

above deﬁnition reduces to the usual one.

Proposition 2.2 Let M be a holomorphic subbundle of T and s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ).
Let q ∈ E an arbitrary point. Let σ be the section of W/M induced by s via the
p
→ W/M . Then degT s(q) = degT /M σ(q)
canonical projection W

Proof: Oviously T /M is a subbundle of W/M and σ ∈ H 0(W/M ) − H 0(T /M ). s
and σ induce the same section s of W/T via the canonical projections W → W/T and
W/M → (W/M )/(T /M ) ≈ W/T . Therefore: degT /M σ(q) = degs(q) = degT s(q). 2

We have the following :

Proposition 2.3 Suppose that W is semistable of normalized degree µ(W ) and that
T has normalized degree µ(T ) = µ(W ). Then we have degT s ≤ µ(W ) for all s ∈
H 0(W ) − H 0(T ).

Proof: Indeed, T is in this case obviously semistable (since W is semistable) and thus
W/T is semistable of normalized degree µ(W/T ) = µ(W ) (see, for example Proposition

7

8 on page 18 of [15]). Then s must have have total degree at most equal to µ(W/T ) =
µ(W ) in order for Ls ≈ O(s) not to destabilize W/T . Then use degT s = degs. 2

For W semistable and µ(T ) = µ(W ) = 1, this shows that a section s ∈ H 0(W ) −
H 0(T ) either does not intersect T or intersects it at exactly one point, the incidence
degree of s at that point being exactly one.

We now give an alternative description of the incidence degree, which is more

practical from a computational point of view.

Proposition 2.4 Let s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ) and q ∈ E. Consider a local holomorphic
frame (s1...sr0) of T around q. Then

degs(q) = degs ∧ s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr0(q)

Proof: Let U be an open neighborhood of q such that the exact sequence

0 −→ T |U

−→ W |U

−→ (W/T )|U −→ 0

splits in the holomorphic category. Let u : (W/T )|u −→ W |U be a holomorphic
injection such that W |U = j(T |U ) ⊕ u((W/T )|U ). We identify T with j(T ) via j and
(W/T )|U with u((W/T )|U ) via u. We can assume that U is small enough so that all
3 bundles involved are trivial above U . Let s1...sr0 be a local holomorphic frame of
T above U and sr0+1...sr a frame of (W/T )|U ≡ u((W/T )|U ). Then s1...sr is a local
frame of W above U .

Write s(e) = Pi=1..r fi(e)si(e) with fi ∈ OU . Then

The statement degT s(q) = d is equivalent to ∃ lime→q z−ds(e) 6= 0, which is equiv-
alent to ∃ lime→q z−df (e) 6= 0, where f := (fr0+1...fr) ∈ ⊕i=r0+1...rOU . This in turn is
equivalent to ∃ lime→q z−ds(e) ∧ s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ sr0(e) 6= 0. 2

Now let s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ) and q ∈ E. The associated section s ∈ H 0(W/T )
deﬁnes a line subbundle Ls ⊂ W/T as above. In particular, at the point q we have
a 1-dimensional subspace (Ls)q of the ﬁbre (W/T )q = Wq/Tq. We deﬁne Ws(q) to
be the (r0 + 1)-dimensional subspace of Wq which induces (Ls)q, i.e. the preimage
pq−→ Wq/Tq. For e ∈ E − ZT (s) we obviously
of (Ls)q via the natural surjection Wq
have Ws(q) =< s(e) > ⊕Te. The following gives an analogue of this decomposition for
points q ∈ ZT (s):

Proposition 2.5 Let s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ) and q ∈ E. Let z be any local holomorphic
coordinate on E, centered at q.

8

The following are equivalent :
(a) degT s(q) = d
(b) There exist local holomorphic sections ˜s of W around q and s0 of T around q

such that :

(b1) s(e) = zd˜s(e) + s0(e) for all e suﬃciently close to q
(b2) ˜s(q) ∈ Wq − Tq
In this case, we have Ws(q) =< ˜s(q) > ⊕Tq.

Proof: Assume (a) holds and consider a neighborhood U of q such that the sequence
7 splits. Since degs(q) = d, we can choose U small enough so that there exists a
holomorphic section σ of W/T above U such that s(e) = zdσ(e), ∀e ∈ U and σ(q) 6= 0.
Then there exists a holomorphic section ˜s := u◦σ of W |U , such that ˜s = p(˜s) = σ. Thus
p(s − zd˜s) = 0, so that s(e) − zd˜s(e) ∈ Te, ∀e ∈ U . Since s(e) − zd˜s(e) is holomorphic,
this gives a holomorphic section s0 of T |U such that s = zd˜s + s0 and (b1) holds.
Moreover, σ(q) 6= 0 implies ˜s(q) ∈ Wq − Tq and thus (b2) holds. Since s(e) = zdσ(e),
we have ˆs(q) = σ(q) so that σ(q) ∈ (Ls)q. Thus ˜s(q) ∈ p−1
q ((Ls)q) = Ws(q) and
Ws(q) =< ˜s(q) > ⊕Tq.

The converse implication is trivial in view of the previous proposition. 2
Note that ˜s, s0 cannot, in general, be extended beyond a neighborhood of q. Also
note that ˜s(q) is only determined modulo Tq and modulo a constant multiplicative
factor (from the choice of the local holomorphic coordinate z around q).

Deﬁnition 2.2 Let s ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(T ). Deﬁne Ws,T = ⊔e∈EWs(e). Then Ws,T has
a natural structure of holomorphic vector bundle over E and s ∈ H 0(Ws,T ) while T is
a holomorphic subbundle of Ws,T .

Proof: A holomorphic trivialization of Ws,T is obtained as follows. For U an open set
such that U ∩ ZT (s) = Φ, choose a local frame s1..sr0 of T over U and trivialize Ws,T
over U by using the local frame s1...sr0, s. For U such that U ∩ ZT (s) = q ( a single
point), by choosing U small enough and picking a local holomorphic coordinate z on
E, one one can write s(e) = zd˜s(e) + s0(e) as before, where d = degT (s) and ˜s does
not meet T over U . Then ˜s is a local holomorphic section of W above U and one can
trivialize Ws,T over U by using s1...sr0, ˜s, where s1...sr0 is a local holomorphic frame
of T above U . The holomorphic compatibility of the various local trivializations is
immediate. 2

Intuitively, the ﬁbre Ws,T (q) =< ˜s(q) > ⊕Tq for q ∈ ZT (s) is the correct ‘limit’ of
the ﬁbres Ws,T (e) =< s(e) > ⊕Te as e → q. The section s determines a line subbundle
Ls of W and we have Ws,T = Ls ⊕ T . For T = 0 (the null subbundle of W ), we
obviously have Ws,0 = Ls. This is a generalization of the construction of Ls.

Now suppose that the set Z(W ) is ﬁnite 5. In this case, if s1...sk ∈ H 0(W ) are
C-linearly independent sections of W , then they are also C-linearly independent at
the generic point of E (i.e. s1(e)...sk(e) are linearly independent in We for a generic

e ∈ E); then we can deﬁne inductively Ws1...sk := Wsk,Ws1...sk−1
, with Ws1 := Ls1.
Indeed, one can easily see that s2 ∈ H 0(W ) − H 0(Ws1) and (by induction) sj ∈
H 0(W ) − H 0(Ws1...sj−1), ∀j = 2..k, due to the generic linear independence of s1..sk.
Ws1...sk is a rank k vector bundle and s1..sk are sections of Ws1..sk which are linearly
independent at the generic point. Intuitivley, Ws1...sk is the subbundle of W ‘spanned’
by s1..sk.

If (σ1...σk)t = A(s1...sk)t, with A ∈ GL(k, C) a constant nondegenerate matrix,
then it is easy to see that Wσ1..σk = Ws1...sk. Indeed, s1...sk are sections of Wσ1..σk
(since σ1...σk are) so that Wσ1...σk,e = Ws1..sk,e for all e with s1(e)...sk(e) linearly
independent. For q ∈ E such that s1(q)...sk(q) are linearly dependent, one can consider
vectors ˜σ1(q), .., ˜σk(q), determined by local sections σj of Wσ1...σj and σ0j of Wσ1...σj−1
σj (q)
˜σj(e) + σ0j(e) for e close to q and σj(q) ∈
via the conditions: σj(e) = z
Wσ1..σj,q−Wσ1...σj−1,q. Note that ˜σ1(q), .., ˜σk(q) are linearly independent. These vectors
obviously belong to Ws1...sk(q) since for e 6= q they are related to σ1...σk (and thus to
s1...sk) by linear combinations of these vectors and since subbundles of W are closed
in the total space of W .

degWσ1...σj−1

Thus Wσ1...σk(q) =< ˜σ1(q), .., ˜σk(q) >⊂ Ws1..sk(q) and they must coincide since they
have the same dimension. Therefore, Ws1...sk depends only on the subspace < s1...sk >
of H 0(W ). Thus, if Z(W ) is ﬁnite then we have a natural map :

ψk : Grk(H 0(W )) → Grk(W ).

(10)

An alternative way to understand this is as follows (cf.

[13]). If Z(W ) is ﬁnite,
then given a k-dimensional subspace K of H 0(W ), φe(K) deﬁnes a rational section f of
Grk(W ), where Grk(W ) is the bundle obtained by taking the grassmannian Grk(We)
of We as the ﬁbre above each e ∈ E. Singularities of this section may appear only
at a point e where φe(K) fails to be k-dimensonal, i.e. at the points e1..es of E
where the values of a system s1..sk of sections of W giving a basis of K fail to be
linearly independent. Loosely speaking, one may worry that at such points there is no
‘completion’ of the set {φe(K)|e ∈ E − {e1..es}} which makes it into the total space
of a holomorphic vector bundle. This does not happen for the following reason. With
the natural structure, Grk(W ) is a complete variety and a classical result implies that
f must be regular. Thus f determines a subbundle of W , which clearly coincides with
Ws1...sk.

Again assuming Z(W ) to be ﬁnite, suppose that we are given a ﬁltration K : 0 :=
K0 ⊂ K1 ⊂ ... ⊂ Kk−1 ⊂ Kk of a subspace Kk of H 0(W ), such that dimCKj = j,
∀j = 0..r. Associated to K via ψ there is a ﬁltration W(K) : 0 := W0 ⊂ W1 ⊂ ... ⊂
Wk−1 ⊂ Wk by holomorphic subbundles with rankWj = j, ∀j = 0..r. If sj ∈ Kj − Kj−1
for all j = 1..k, then it is obvious that the integers δK
j (t) := degs1 ∧ ... ∧ sj(t) (t ∈
Z(W ), j = 1..r) depend only on K. It is also easy to see – by using Proposition 2.5 –
that degWj−1sj(t) = δK

j−1(t), where we let δK

0 (t) be equal to 0.

Being an exact sequence of vector spaces, this must split. Therefore, there must exist

Suppose that ˆs1(p), ˆs2(p) are linearly dependent. Then we can write ˆs1(p) = αˆs2(p)
with α ∈ C∗. The section s := s1 − αs2 is then nonzero (since s1, s2 are C-linearly
independent) and we obviously have degs(p) ≥ 2, which contradicts semistability of
F ′

r. Thus, it must be the case that ˆs1(q), ˆs2(q) are linearly independent.

Now suppose there exists e0 ∈ E − {p} such that s1(e0) and s2(e0) are linearly
dependent. Write s1(e0) = βs2(e0), with β ∈ C∗. Then the section s′ = s1 − βs2
vanishes both at e0 and at p and so degs′(p) ≥ 2, again contradicting semistability of
F ′

r. It follows that s1(e), s2(e) are linearly independent for all e ∈ E − {p}.

From these two facts we immediately see that the subbundle sum L1 + L2 is direct.
Since (si) = p, we also have Li ≈ O(p); thus we have a holomorphic subbundle L1 ⊕

11

L2 = O(p) ⊕ O(p) of F ′
r. Twisting by O(−p), this gives a trivial subbundle of rank two
I2 ⊂ Fr. Since h0(I2) = 2, this would imply h0(Fr) ≥ 2, a contradiction. This ﬁnishes
the proof of the ﬁrst statement.

Now let e ∈ E − {p}. To show that Ke = 0, we proceed by induction on r, using

the sequence (14).

For r = 1 the statement is obvious. Suppose the statement holds for r − 1, but
fails for r. Then there exists a nonzero section s of F ′
r such that s(e) = 0. We cannot
have s ∈ H 0(imj) since that would imply degs ≥ 2 (as e 6= p), which contradicts
semistability of F ′
r−1. Since s(e) = 0, we
have s(e) = 0, so that Ke(F ′
r−1) 6= 0. This is impossible by the induction hypothesis.

Consider the commutative group structure (E, ⊕) on E with zero element p.
If
q1, q2 ∈ E, then q1 ⊕ q2 is deﬁned to be the unique point q of E such that (q1) + (q2) ∼
(q) + (p), i.e. O(q1 + q2) ≈ O(q + p). Thus (q1 ⊕ q2) ∼ (q1) + (q2) − (p). Then
(q1 ⊕ ... ⊕ qr) ∼ (q1) + ... + (qr) − (r − 1)p.

q ∈ E → O(q − p) ∈ Pic0(E) is a group isomorphism from (E, ⊕) to Pic0(E), which
maps T (p)
(E) to the subgroup Ur := {L ∈ Pic0(E)|Lr ≈ OE} ⊂ Pic0(E) of roots of

r shows that
s1(e)...sr−2(e), sr(e) are linearly independent for all e ∈ E, while s1(e)...sr−2(e), sr−1(e),
sr(e) are linearly independent for e 6= p. Thus s1(e)...sr−2(e), sr(e) determine a triv-
ial subbundle Ir−1 of F ′
r and sr−1(e) belongs to this subbundle iﬀ e = p (where
sr−1(p) = 0). It follows that the induced section sr−1 of the line bundle L := F ′
r/Ir−1
vanishes only at p. Since degF ′
r = r, we have degL = r so that deg(sr−1) = r.
Therefore (sr−1) = rp and L ≈ O(rp). This gives an exact sequence :

If A′ is an extension of O(rp) by Ir−1, then detA′ ≈ O(rp). If A′ is indecomposable

(q is uniquely determined by A). Then A′ ≈ O(q) ⊗ Fr, so that detA′ ≈ O(rq). Thus
we must have O(rq) ≈ O(rp) i.e. q ∈ T (p)

Note that s2...sr generate a trivial subbundle Ir−1 of F ′

r (since they are everywhere
linearly independent), while the section s1 is incident on Ir−1 at p in order r. This is
in agreement with the previous proposition. The precise manner of incidence of s1 on
Ir−1 is controlled by condition (b3).

Note that (c31) acts as an inductive deﬁnition of the ﬁltration K. For j = 1,
(c31) gives K1 = kerφp = Kp(V ′). The map ψ1 : Gr1(H 0(V ′)) → Gr1(V ′) gives
the subbundle W1 = ψ1(K1). Then (c32) for j = 2 deﬁnes K2, the map ψ2 gives
W2 = ψ2(K2) and so on. In particular, K is naturally associated to F ′

that sr(e) ∈ (F ′
r−1)p). Since je
is injective for all e ∈ E, and since σ1...σr−1 satisfy (b1), we see that s1(e)...sr(e) are
linearly independent for all e ∈ E −{p}, so that s1...sr satisfy (b1). By (b2) for σ1...σr−1

αr−1sr−1(p). Then s := sr − α2s2 − .. − αr−1sr−1 is a regular section of F ′
r which
vanishes at p. Since sr is linearly independent of s1...sr−1, it is clear that s is linearly
independent of s1...sr−1. In particular, s is linearly independent of s1. This implies
that we have two linearly independent sections s1, s of F ′
r, both vanishing at p. Since
this is impossible by virtue of Proposition 2.6, it follows that s2(p)...sr(p) are linearly
independent and (b2) holds.

r. Since (b3) holds for F ′

Since p∗(sr) = σr has a simple zero at p, it follows that sr vanishes in order 1 along
the subbundle j∗(F ′
r−1 by the induction hypothesis,
we also know that sj vanishes in order 1 along the subbundle Wj of F ′
r−1, where
Wj = Ws1...sj , for all j = 1..r − 1.
In particular, we have sj(e) = z˜sj(p) + s0j(e),
with s0j ∈ H 0(Wj−1) for all j = 1..r − 1, and all e suﬃciently close to p. This implies
that s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ sr−1(e) = zr−1˜s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ ˜sr−1(e) so that ˜s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ ˜sr−1(e) 6= 0
for e near p. This shows that ˜s1, ..., ˜sr−1 give a local holomorphic frame of F ′
r−1 in a
vicinity of p. Then by Proposition 6, we must have deg˜s1 ∧ ... ∧ ˜sr−1 ∧ sr(p) = 1, so
that degs1 ∧ ... ∧ sr(p) = r. Thus (b3) holds for F ′

r. Thus (a) implies (b).

Show that (b) implies (c)
Assume (b) holds. Then (c1) and (c2) are obvious. We can construct a ﬁltration:

K : 0 := K0 ⊂ K1 :=< s1 >⊂ K2 :=< s1, s2 >⊂ ... ⊂ Kr := H 0(V ′)

(26)

of H 0(V ′), and an associated ﬁltration :

W : 0 := W0 ⊂ W1 ⊂ W2 ⊂ ... ⊂ Wr := V ′

(27)

of V ′, as explained in the previous subsection. Let us analyze the situation at the point
p.

Claim: For each j = 1..r, we have degWj−1sj(p) = 1 and s2(p)...sj(p) is a C-basis

of (Wj−1)p.

We prove the claim by induction on j. For j = 1 we have Wj−1 = W0 = 0 and, by
(b3), we have degW0s1(p) = degs1(p) = 1. The second part of the claim is trivial in
this case.

Now let j ∈ {2...r} and assume that the claim is true for all j′ < j. Fix a local

coordinate z on E, centered at p. By Proposition 2.5, we can write :

sk(e) = z˜sk(e) + s0k(e), ∀k = 1..j − 1

(28)

for all e suﬃciently close to p, where ˜sk(p) ∈ V ′
p − (Wk−1)p and s0k is a local section
of Wk−1. Then s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ sj−1(e) = zj−1˜s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ ˜sj−1(e) for e close to p. By (b3),
we have ˜s1(p) ∧ ... ∧ ˜sj−1(p) 6= 0 and by continuity ˜s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ ˜sj−1(e) 6= 0 for e close
to p. Thus ˜s1...˜sj−1 is a local holomorphic frame of Wj−1 around p. We obtain :

s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ sj(e) = zj−1˜s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ ˜sj−1(e) ∧ sj(e)

(for e close to p), which together with (b3) gives :

(29)

(30)

deg˜s1 ∧ ... ∧ ˜sj−1 ∧ sj(p) = 1

15

Since ˜s1...˜sj−1 is a local holomorphic frame of Wj−1 around p, this shows, by Proposi-
tion 6, that degWj−1sj(p) = 1.

Since ˜s1(p)∧...∧˜sj−1(p)∧sj(p) = 0 by (30), it follows that sj(p) ∈< ˜s1(p)...˜sj−1(p) >
= (Wj−1)p. By the induction hypothesis, s2(p)...sj−1(p) is a basis of (Wj−2)p ⊂
(Wj−1)p, so that s2(p)....sj−1(p) ∈ (Wj−1)p. Thus, the vectors s2(p)....sj (p) all be-
long to the j-dimensional vector space (Wj−1)p. Since they are linearly independent
by (b2), they must form a basis of this subspace. This ﬁnishes the proof of the claim.
j−1(p) = degWj−1sj(p), the ﬁrst part of the claim implies (c32). The

j (p) − δK

Since δK

second part of the claim is easily seen to imply (c31). Thus (b) implies (c).

Show that (c) implies (a)
Again proceed by induction on r. For r = 1 the statement is immediate.
Now let r > 1 and suppose that (c) ⇒ (a) holds for r − 1. Also assume that
V ′ satisﬁes (c). Since K is nondegenerate, we have dimCKj = j for all j = 1..r.
In particular, K1 is a line bundle. By (c31) and (c31) we have K1 ≈ O(p). Deﬁne

It is now possible to analyze the freedom in the choice of ˜sj and deﬁne a notion
of canonical bases of H 0(F ′
r) by imposing further conditions on s1..sr. This leads
to a concrete description of the endomorphisms of F ′
r via their induced action on
H 0(F ′
r), which can then be used to analyze the endomorphisms of a general degree
zero semistable bundle by using the results of the next subsection. Since this is not
directly related to the main focus of the present paper, we will not proceed down that
path.

2.3 The main theorem

The results of the previous subsection immediately lead to:

Theorem 2.2 Let V be a degree zero holomorphic vector bundle of rank r over E and
V ′ = V ⊗O(p). Let φe be the evaluation map of V ′ and S := Z(V ′) := {t ∈ E|Kt(V ′) 6=
0}. The following are equivalent :

(a) V is semistable
(b0) h0(V ′) = r
(b1) The set S is ﬁnite. Let dt := dimCKt(V ′) for all t ∈ S.
(b3) There exists a direct sum decomposition :

(c2) The set S is ﬁnite. Let dt = dimCKt(V ′), ∀t ∈ S
(c3) There exists a basis (s(i)

the properties :

(c31) deg(Λi=1..dt,t′∈Ss(i)
(c32) (s(i)
(c33) deg(s(i)
In this case, we have:

t,j)(t) = j, ∀t ∈ S, ∀i = 1..dt, ∀j = 1..rt,i

The proof should be rather obvious by now.

rt,i(t) are isomorphic to O(t) ⊗ Frt,i, while W (i)

Instead of writing down all of its
details, let us try to make the statement of the theorem look less formidable. Clearly
the bundles W (i)
j (t) ≈ O(t) ⊗ Fj give
their canonical ﬁltrations. dt is the number of diﬀerent indecomposable bundles which
multiply O(t) in the decomposition of V ′. These bundles are just W (i)
rt,i(t), and have
ranks rt,i (of which some may coincide). Conditions (b32) and (b33) or, equivalently,
conditions (c32) and (c33) are needed to assure that W (i)
rt,i(t) ≈ Frt,i. Conditions

We immediately obtain 7:

Corrolary 2.1 Let V be a degree zero semistable holomorphic vector bundle over E
and V ′ = V ⊗ O(p). Let s1...sr be a C-basis of H 0(V ′). Then the spectral divisor of V
is given by :

ΣV = (s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr)

(41)

Proof: Since (s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr) is independent of the choice of the basis of sections s1...sr,
we can choose s1..sr to have the properties listed in (c) of Theorem 2.2. Then the
conclusion is obvious. 2

This shows that the spectral divisor can be computed by an obvious adaptation of
the methods of [1] even in the general case. However, the divisor (s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr) alone
cannot give us enough information to test semistability and/or determine the splitting
type.

Starting from the above theorem, it is relatively straightforward to develop an
algorithm for testing semistability of V and determining its splitting type by doing a
series of simple manipulations on an arbitrary basis of H 0(V ′). Instead of presenting
the algorithm in its full generality (which requires introducing a slightly tedious amount
of notation), we will show explicitly how this can be implemented in the simpler case
when one is interested in identifying degree zero fully decomposable semistable bundles.
This is explained in section 3 below.

2.4 The spectral divisor in the monad case and a ‘moduli
problem’

In this subsection we consider the case when V is given by the cohomology of a monad:

0 −→ ⊕j=1..sOE

−→ ⊕a=1..mO(Da)

−→ O(D0) −→ 0

f

g

(42)

Here Da, D0 are some divisors on E. We deﬁne the twisted bundles and exact sequences
as before. We denote all twisted objects by a prime. As usual, we twist by O(p) with
p an arbitrary point on E.p is ﬁxed throughout the following discussion. We have
m = r + s + 1 where r := rankV .

Write (42) as the pair of exact sequences :

0 −→ kerg ֒→ ⊕a=1..mO(Da)

−→ O(D0) −→ 0

(43)

g

7This result can also be obtained without making use of Theorem 2.2

19

0 −→ ⊕j=1..sOE

−→ kerg

−→ V −→0

f

p

By taking degrees we obtain :

degV = X

degDa − degD0 = deg(kerg)

a=1..m

(44)

(45)

We have:

Proposition 2.8 The following are equivalent :

(a) V is semistable and of degree zero
(b) kerg is semistable and of degree zero

Proof:
Assume that (a) holds. Then the sequence (44) shows that kerg is an extension of
⊕j=1..sOE by V . As both these bundles are semistable and of slope zero, a standard
result of Seshadri (see. for example, [15]) immediately entails (b).

Assume (b) holds. Then (44) shows that V = cokerf and since ⊕j=1..sOE and kerg
are both semistable and of slope zero we can use another result of Seshadri to obtain
(a). 2

This proposition reduces the study of semistabilty of V to that of kerg. In particular,
we see that semistability of V depends only on the properties of the map g and on the
bundles ⊕a=1..mO(Da) and O(D0).

For the following we assume that ⊕a=1..mdegDa = degD0 := d. with d ≥ 0. We let

da := degDa. Then (45) assures us that degV = degkerg = 0.

Now suppose that V is semistable .
Then by Proposition 2.8 kerg is also semistable . Then Lemma 1.1 assures us that
H 1(kerg′) = 0. Noting that H 1(O(p)) also vanishes by the Riemann-Roch theorem,
it follows that by twisting the two exact sequences above and taking cohomology we
obtain two short exact sequences :

0 −→ H 0(kerg′) ֒→ ⊕a=1..mH 0(O(D′

a))

g∗
−→ H 0(O(D′

0)) −→ 0

0 −→ ⊕j=1..sH 0(O(p))

f∗
−→ H 0(kerg′)

p∗
−→ H 0(V ′)−→0

a := Da + p, D′

where D′
0 := D0 + p and we denoted f ⊗ id, g ⊗ id by the same letters
for simplicity. The collapse of the cohomology sequence associated to (43) is a direct
consequence of the semistability of kerg.

Since d + 1 is positive, the Riemann-Roch theorem tells us that h0(O(D′

0)) =
deg(D′
0) = degD0 + 1 = d + 1. Since kerg is semistable and of degree zero, Lemma 1.1
gives h0(kerg′) = rank(kerg) = r + s = m − 1; then (46) gives h0(⊕a=1..mO(D′
a)) = m +
d. This last fact is not a consequence of Riemann-Roch unless da are all nonnegative.

Proposition 2.9 Let Σkerg and ΣV be the spectral divisors of kerg, respectively V .
Then Σkerg = ΣV + sp.

(46)

(47)

20

Proof: Since (47) is an exact sequence of vector spaces, it must split. We can thus

choose a basis v1...vr+s of kerg′ with the properties :

(1)v1 = f∗(w1)...vs = f∗(ws), where w1...ws is a basis of A := ⊕j=1..sH 0(O(p))
(2)p∗(vs+1) := u1...p∗(vs+r) := ur is a basis of H 0(V ′)
The canonical isomorphism det(kerg′) ≈ det(A) ⊗ det(V ′) maps the section v1 ∧ .. ∧
vr+s ∈ H 0(det(kerg′)) into the the section (w1 ∧ ... ∧ ws) ⊗ (u1 ∧ ... ∧ ur) ∈ H 0(detA) ⊗
H 0(detV ′) ⊂ H 0(detA ⊗ detV ′). Thus:

Σkerg = (v1∧...∧vr+s) = (w1∧...∧ws⊗u1∧...∧ur) = (w1∧...∧ws)+(u1∧...∧ur) = sp+ΣV
(48)

where in the ﬁrst and last line we used the corrolary to Theorem 2.2. 2

The relation between Σkerg and the bundle B := ⊕a=1..mO(D′

a) is more complicated.
The reason is that there is no simple connection between the local behaviour of the
sections of kerg and the sections of B8. To extract more information about kerg, one
has to undertake a more detailed study based on the properties of the map g.
In
particular, one would like to ﬁnd necessary and suﬃcient conditions on g such that
kerg is semistable and describe the associated moduli space of g. Although we will not
attempt this here, let us formulate the geometric set-up of the problem.

Theorem 2.2 reduces the semistability condition for kerg to conditions on the sub-
space W := H 0(kerg′) of U := H 0(B). We have dimCU = m + d and semistability
requires that dimCW = m−1. Let He := kerφB

Suppose for simplicity that all Da are eﬀective and that Card{a ∈ {1..m}|da = 0} =

for all e ∈ E, we have ker(φB

while for all a with da = 0 (i.e. Da = 0, O(D′
) = 1
for e 6= p and codimC(kerφO(D′
a)
) = 0. Thus codimCHe = m for all e 6= p while
codimCHp = m − ν.

Note that dimC W + dimCHe = dimCU − 1 for e 6= p while dimCW + dimCHp =
dimCU + ν − 1. For given divisors Da and a given map g, W ∩ He will have ﬁxed
dimension D for almost all points e ∈ E. The points where the dimension of this
intersection increases correspond to the points of the set Z(kerg′).

If ν > 1, it follows that dimCW ∩ Hp ≥ ν − 1. On the other hand, we cannot deduce

any simple lower bound on dimCW ∩ He for e 6= p.

Geometrically, we are given a map H : E → Sbsp(U ), H(e) := He, ∀e ∈ E from E
to the set of subspaces of the m + d-dimensional C-vector space U . The precise form
of this map is completely ﬁxed by the bundle B. As e varies in E, He describes a
complicated trajectory in Sbsp(U ). Generically on E, He has codimension m, except
at the point e = p where it has codimension m − ν.

8This happens because typically we have da > 0 for some a. Then O(D′

a) is quasi-ample (the evaluation

map is surjective everywhere), which to complications.

21

Giving a semistable subbundle of B of the form kerg requires giving the m − 1
dimensional subspace W of U , with the property that it is complementary to He for
a generic e ∈ E and satisfying the other conditions in Theorem 2.2. The precise
position of W inside U is controlled by the map g.
It is not hard to see that the
remaining conditions in the theorem can be expressed in terms of ‘incidence relations’
constraining the ‘speeed of incidence’ of W on He as e → ti; this is similar to the
discussion of Section 2.

The set-up above allows us to reduce the problem of determining the maps g giving
a semistable kerg to a problem in linear algebra and analysis. In particular, it is ideal
for extracting information about ‘moduli’. The ‘trajectory’ of He is, however, rather
complicated in general and the problem may be quite diﬃcult in practice. It would be
interesting to investigate this further.

3 The fully split case

3.1 Twist by O(p)

Let (E, p) be an elliptic curve with a marked point and V a holomorphic bundle of
degree zero and rank r on E. Let V ′ := V ⊗ O(p).

We say that V is fully split if there exists a decomposition V = ⊕j=1..rLj of V into

a direct sum of line bundles Lj.

We present an algorithm for determining whether a given degree zero holomorphic
vector bundle V is semistable and fully split. The algorithm requires explicit knowledge
of H 0(V ′) and allows for the determination of the line bundles Lj up to holomorphic
equivalence.

Theorem 3.1 Let V be a degree zero holomorphic vector bundle of rank r over E. Let
Re := Re(V ′), re := dimCRe, Ke := Ke(V ′) and de := dimCKe for any e ∈ E.

The following statements are equivalent :
(a) V is semistable and fully split
(b) V ′ satisﬁes all of the following conditions :
(b0) h0(V ′) = r
(b1) The set S := Z(V ′) = {t ∈ E|rt < r} is ﬁnite
(b2) For all t ∈ S, all holomorphic sections of V ′ belonging to Kt − 0 have degree

1 at t

(b3) For each t ∈ S we have V ′
(b4) We have H 0(V ′) = ⊕t∈SKt
(c) V ′ satisﬁes (b0),(b1), (b4) and the condition that there exits a basis (s1..sr) of

t = Rt ⊕ Nt

H 0(V ′) such that :

(b23) degs1 ∧ s2 ∧ ... ∧ sr(t) = dt, ∀t ∈ S
Moreover, in this case we have V ≈ ⊕t∈SO(t − p)⊕dt .

22

Note that if (b23) holds for a basis of H 0(V ′) then it will hold for any other basis.
Proof:
Show that (a) implies (b):
Assume (a) holds and write V = ⊕i=1..rLi with Li ∈ Pic0(E). Then Li ≈ O(qi − p)

(qi ∈ E) and V ′ = ⊕i=1..rL′

i, with L′
We know that (b0) holds by Lemma 1.1. Let si ∈ H 0(L′

i = Li ⊗ O(p) ≈ O(qi).

i) − {0}. Then s1...sr is
a C-basis of H 0(V ′). We obviously have S = ∪i=1..r{qi}, so (b1) holds. Since V ′ is
semistable of slope 1 we see that (b2) also holds (cf. the remark before Proposition
2.1).

Now suppose there are two distinct points t1, t2 ∈ S such that Kt1 ∩ Kt2 6= {0}. Let
s ∈ Kt1 ∩ Kt2. Then s(t1) = s(t2) = 0 and, since s is regular, we must have degLs ≥ 2,
which contradicts semistability of V ′. Thus the sum Pt∈S Kt is direct. On the other
hand, any s ∈ H 0(V ′) is a linear combination s = Pi=1..r αisi (αi ∈ C). Since si ∈ Kqi,
we have s ∈ Pt∈S Kt. Thus (b4) holds.

To show (b3), note that L′
we clearly have Rt = ⊕i;qi6=t(L′

Show that (b) implies (a):
Let dt := dimCKt (t ∈ S). By (b4), we can choose a C-basis (s(t)

j (t) 6= 0, ∀j = 1..dt and s(t)
(t)(t′ ∈ S − {t}, j = 1..dt′ ) and ˆs(t)

j )t∈S,j=1..dt of
j )j=1..dt is a C -basis of Kt for each t ∈ S. By (b4) and (b2), each
i has exactly one zero on E, namely at t, and this zero is simple (the unicity
have

H 0(V ′) such that (s(t)
section s(t)
of this zero easily follows from (b4)). Therefore the line bundles L(t)

have V ′
)t, ∀t ∈ S. On the other hand, for all e ∈ E − S we have
dimCRe = r. Since (s(t)
j (e))t∈S,j=1..dt obviously generate Re and since (b4) implies that
Card{s(t)
j(e))t∈S,j=1..dt is a C-basis
e = ⊕t∈S,i=1..dt(L(t)
of V ′
i )e, for e ∈ E − S.
Therefore, V ′ = ⊕t∈S,j=1..dtL(t)
j . Since each component of this sum has slope 1, it
follows that V ′ is semistable and of slope 1, while V = V ′ ⊗ O(−p) is semistable and
of degree zero. We also have V ′ ≈ ⊕t∈SO(t)dt and V ≈ ⊕t∈SO(t − p)dt.

j |t ∈ S, j = 1..dt} = r, it must be the case that (st

j (t)(j = 1..dt) form a basis of V ′

t = ⊕t′∈S,j=1..dt′ (L(t′)

j

Show that (b) and (c) are equivalent
For this, assume that (b0), (b1) and (b4) hold. Then we show that (b2) and (b3)

together are equivalent to (b23).

Remember that degs1 ∧ ... ∧ sr(e) does not depend on the choice of the C-basis of
H 0(V ′). Enumerating S = {t1..tk} we can assume that (si)d1+...+dj−1+1≤i≤d1+...+dj is
a C-basis of Ktj for all j = 1..k. Since the argument is similar for each j, let us focus
on t1 := t. Then s1...sdt is a basis of Kt and for i = 1..dt we have si(e) = zσi(e) for all

23

e close to t, where σi are local holomorphic sections of V ′ around t.

Claim 1: If (b0), (b1) and (b4) hold then sdt+1(t)...sr(t) is a basis of Rt.
Indeed, since s1(t) = ...sdt (t) = 0, we clearly have that sdt+1(t)...sr(t) generate Rt.
If αdt+1sdt+1(t) + ... + αrsr(t) = 0 is zero a linear combination, then the section s :=
αdt+1sdt+1 +...+αrsr of V ′ vanishes at t so that it belongs to Kt. Since our basis s1...sr
is ‘adapted’ to the decomposition (b4), s then gives an element of Kt ∩ (Pt′∈S−{t} Kt′),
which must be zero since the sum in (b4) is direct. Since sdt+1...sr are C-linearly
independent, this implies that αdt+1 = .. = αr = 0. Thus sdt+1(t)...sr(t) are linearly
independent and the claim is proven.

Claim 2: If (b0), (b1) and (b4) hold then the following are equivalent:
(α) (b2) holds at t
(β) σ1(t)...σdt (t) are linearly independent
In this case, σ1(t)...σdt (t) form a basis of Nt.
To prove this, ﬁrst assume that (b2) holds at t. Consider a zero linear combination
If the section s := α1s1(t) + ... + αdt sdt would be
α1σ1(t) + ... + αdtσdt (t) = 0.
nonzero, then it would have vanishing degree at least 2 at t. This would contradict
(b2). Therefore, we must have s = 0 and α1 = ..αdt = 0. This proves that (α) implies
(β).

Now assume that (β) holds and consider a section s ∈ Kt −{0}. Then s = α1s1(t)+
... + αdt sdt for some αi ∈ C so that s(e) = z(α1σ1(e) + ... + αdt σdt(e)) for e close to
t. Since s is not the zero section, at least one αi is nonzero and (β) implies that
α1σ1(t) + ... + αdt σdt(t) is nonzero. Thus s has degree 1 at t and (α) holds.

Assume that the equivalent conditions (α), (β) hold and show that σ1(t)...σdt (t)
If s ∈ Kt − {0},
generate Nt. We have Nt :=< A >, where A := {ˆs(t)|s ∈ Kt}.
the above arguments show that ˆs(t) belongs to < σ1(t)...σdt (t) >, and this is also
trivially true for s = 0 (since ˆs(t) = 0 by deﬁnition in this case). Therefore we have
A ⊂< σ1(t)...σdt (t) > and σ1(t)...σdt (t) generate Nt. This ﬁnishes the proof of Claim
2.

Now return to the proof of the theorem. Since s1(e) ∧ ... ∧ sr(e) = z(σ1(e) ∧ ... ∧
σdt(e) ∧ sdt+1(e) ∧ ... ∧ sr(e)) for e close to t, (b23) is equivelent to the statement
that σ1(t)...σdt (t), sdt+1(t)...sr(t) is a basis of V ′. By Claim 1, linear independence of
sdt+1(t)...sr(t) is automatic and < sdt+1(t)...sr(t) >= Rt. By Claim 2, linear inde-
pendence of σ1(t)...σdt (t) is equivalent to (b2) and in this case < σ1(t)...σdt (t) >= Nt.
Then < σ1(t)...σdt (t), sdt+1(t)...sr(t) >= V ′

t is equivalent to (b3). 2

Let us explain how one can test (b4). Suppose that (b0), (b1) hold and let s1...sr be
an arbitrary C-basis of H 0(V ′). For each t ∈ S, consider the dt -dimensional subspace
Pt of Cr of linear relations among s1(t)...sr(t):

Pt := {a := (a1...ar) ∈ Cr|a1s1(t) + .. + arsr(t) = 0}
Choose vectors a(t,j) ∈ Cr (t ∈ S, j = 1..dt) such that, for each t ∈ S (a(t,j))j=1..dt
is a basis of Pt. Let ζ (t,j) := Pi=1..r a(t,j)
si ∈ H 0(V ′). Then (ζ (t,j))j=1..dt is a basis of
Kt for all t ∈ S. In particular, we have dt = dimCPt. Clearly (b4) is equivalent to the

Chosing an enumeration S = {ti|i = 1..k} of S, we can form a matrix A ∈
M at(d, r, C), whose lines are given by the vectors (a(ti,j))i=1..k,j=1..dt. Then (b4) is
equivalent to the conditions d = r and detA 6= 0. Therefore, we obtain the following

condition:

Algorithm :

Suppose V is a rank r and degree zero holomorphic vector bundle over E. Let

p ∈ E arbitrary and deﬁne V ′ := V ⊗ O(p).

Step 1:
Obtain a basis (s1...sn) of H 0(V ′).

Step 2:
If n 6= r then V is not semistable. Otherwise, continue with Step 3.

Step 3:
Let δ := s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr ∈ H 0(ΛrV ′). If δ = 0 then V is not semistable (this follows
from the main theorem in section 2). Otherwise, the set S := supp(δ) is ﬁnite. In this
case, enumerate S = {t1..tk} and continue with Step 4.

Step 4 :
For each t ∈ S, determine dt = dimCKt
each of the following conditions is satisﬁed:

9. Then V ′ is semistable and fully split iﬀ

(a) Pt∈S dt = r
(b) degs1 ∧ ... ∧ sr(t) = dt for all t ∈ S
(c) The matrix A is nonsingular
In this case, we have V ′ ≈ ⊕t∈SO(t)⊕dt . In particular, the spectral divisor of V is

given by :

ΣV = X
t∈S

dt t = (s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr)

(50)

Note that suppΣV = S.

3.2 More general twists

Let V be a fully split semistable vector bundle of degree zero over E. Then V =
⊕j=1..rLj with Lj ∈ Pic0(E).

9 In general we can determine dt as dt = dimCPt. In the monad case, V ′ has a natural embedding into a
direct sum of line bundles and dt can be determined directly by considering the rank of a matrix of sections
as in [1]

Let D = p1 + ...+ ph be an eﬀective divisor on E, where p1...ph are mutually distinct
points on E. We use p1 as a base point of E. Then we can write Lj ≈ O(qj − p1) with
qj ∈ E. Deﬁne:

V ′ := V ⊗ O(D) = ⊕j=1..rL′
j

(51)

where L′

j := Lj ⊗ O(D) ≈ O(qj + p2 + ... + ph).

Since degL′

j = h, we have h0(L′

j) = h and h0(V ′) = rh. The Riemann-Roch
theorem gives h1(V ′) = 0. The spectral divisor of V is ΣV = Pj=1..r qj. Let S :=
suppΣV . For each q ∈ S, let Sq = {j ∈ {1..r}|qj = q} and dq := CardSq. Then
L′

j ≈ O(q + p2 + .. + ph) for all j ∈ Sq.

Lemma 3.1 Let q ∈ E be arbitrary. The set :

Gq(D) := {s ∈ H 0(O(q + p2 + ... + ph))|s(pj) = 0, ∀j = 2..h}

(52)

is a one-dimensional subspace of the C-vector space H 0(O(q + p2 + ...+ ph)). Moreover,
for any s ∈ Sq(D) − {0} we have :

Proof: Obviously the zero section belongs to Gq(D). Now let s ∈ Gq(D) − {0}.

Since s(p2) = ... = s(ph) = 0, we have :

(s) = q + p2 + p3 + ... + ph

(s) = Ds + p2 + ... + ph

with Ds an eﬀective divisor. Since s ∈ H 0(O(q + p2 + ... + ph)), we have deg(s) =
deg(q + p2 + ... + ph) = h. But deg(s) = degDs + (h − 1) by (54). Thus degDs=1.
Since Ds is eﬀective this implies Ds = q′ for some q′ ∈ E. On the other hand,
s ∈ H 0(O(q + p2 + ... + ph)) implies (s) ∼ q + p2 + ... + ph, where ∼ denotes linear
equivalence. Together with (54), this gives q′ ∼ q. If q′ 6= q, this would imply E ≈ P1
by a classical theorem. Thus we must have q′ = q and (s) = q + p2 + ... + ph for all
(s) ∈ Gq(D) − {0}. By a standard argument this implies that any s′ ∈ Gq(D) − {0} is
of the form s′ = λs with λ ∈ C∗ a constant. Thus Gq(D) is a one dimensional C-vector
space. 2
Let :

Gj := {s ∈ H 0(L′

j)|s(p2) = ... = s(ph) = 0} ≈ Gqj (D)

(j = 1..r). By Lemma 3.1, Gj are one-dimensional subspaces of H 0(V ′). Deﬁne :

G := {s ∈ H 0(V ′)|s(p2) = ... = s(ph) = 0} ⊂ H 0(V ′)

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

and:

(for all q ∈ S).

G(q) = ⊕j∈Sq Gj ⊂ G

26

Proposition 3.1 We have :

G = ⊕j=1..rGj = ⊕q∈SG(q)

(58)

In particular, G is an r-dimensional subspace of the rh dimensional C-vector space
H 0(V ′). Moreover, for any s ∈ G − {0} we have the alternative :

Either
(a) (s) = q + p2 + ... + ph for some q ∈ S
or
(b) (s) = p2 + ... + ph

If (a) holds then s ∈ G(q) for some q ∈ S, while if (b) holds then s ∈ G − ∪q∈SG(q).

Here the equalities are between divisors and not between divisor classes. That is,
the equality in (a) and (b) is to be taken at face value and not in the sense of linear
equivalence.
Proof:
Since V ′ = ⊕j=1..rL′
Now let s ∈ G − {0}. By Proposition 2.3, we have:

j, the statement G = ⊕j=1..rGj is obvious.

deg(s) ≤ µ(V ′) = h

Since (s) is eﬀective and p2...pr ∈ supp(s), there are only two possibilities :

(a) (s) = q + p2 + ... + ph for some q ∈ E (note that q may belong to the set

{p2...ph}), and in this case deg(s) = h

(b) (s) = p2 + ... + ph, and in this case deg(s) = h − 1.

Using G = ⊕j=1..rGj, we can write:

where sj ∈ Gj. From sj ∈ Gj ⊂ H 0(L′
Since (60) is a direct sum, we have :

j), we obtain (sj) = qj+p2+...+ph unless sj = 0.

s = ⊕j=1..rsj

(sj) ≥ (s) unless sj = 0

(59)

(60)

(61)

for all j = 1..r 10. Indeed, s can have a zero of order m at e ∈ E iﬀ each sj has a zero
of order at least m at e.

In case (a), (61) shows that (sj) = (s) for all j = 1..r with sj diﬀerent from zero.

This set is nonvoid iﬀ q ∈ S and in this case we obtain s = Pj∈Sq sj ∈ G(q).

In case (b), we cannot have s ∈ G(q) for any q, since obviously this would imply

(s) ≥ q + p2 + ... + ph, a contradiction. 2

Deﬁnition 3.1 A C-basis σ1...σr of G is called canonical if degσj = h, for each
j = 1..r.

10This means that deg(sj)(e) ≥ deg(s)(e) for all e ∈ E.

27

By the previous proposition, a basis of G is canonical iﬀ it is adapted to the grad-
j )j=1..dq bases of G(q).

uation (58) of G, i.e. iﬀ it is of the form (σq

j )q∈S,j=1..dq with (σq

Corrolary 3.1 Let s1...sr be an arbitrary basis of G. Then the spectral divisor of V
is given by :

ΣV = (s1 ∧ .... ∧ sr) − r(p2 + ... + pd)

(62)

Proof: Indeed, if σ1...σr is a canonical basis of G then we have (s1 ∧ ... ∧ sr) = (σ1 ∧
... ∧ σr) = Pj=1..r qj + r(p2 + ... + pr) = ΣV + r(p2 + ... + pr). 2

This reduces the problem of determining the spectral divisor of V to ﬁnding a basis
of G. In the monad case, that can be easily accomplished by an obvious modiﬁcation
of the methods of [1].

It is now straightforward to formulate an analogue of Theorem 3.1, in which H 0(V ′)
is replaced by G, whose proof is almost identical. Since this brings no new concepts to
bear, we will not insist.

There is a also a relatively straightforward generalization of the above to the non-
fully-split case. A detailed statement would be rather lengthy and will not be given
here.

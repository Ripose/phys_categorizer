Abstract 

     Özdoğan  (Int.  J.  Quantum  Chem.,  92  (2003)  419)  published  formulas  for  evaluating  the 

multielectron  multicenter  molecular 

integrals  over  Slater-type  orbitals  (STOs).  It 

is 

demonstrated that the formulas presented in this work are not original and they can easily be 

derived  by  means  of  a  simple  algebra  from  the  relationship  of  our  published  papers

I. Introduction 

     It is well known that the variational method for improving the Hartree-Fock (HF) solution 

in which the interelectronic coordinates are explicitly included in the wave functions was first 

introduced  by  Hylleraas  [1,2].  The  solutions  obtained  by  the  Hylleraas  method  converge  to 

the exact solution of Schrödinger equation with any desired degree of accuracy if a sufficient 

number of terms are included. However, it is difficult to evaluate the multicenter integrals that 

arise  in  Hylleraas  theory.  The  Hylleraas  method  developed  first  by  James  and  Coolidge  [3] 

has been used for determining the ground state energy of the 

 molecule [4,5] and still valid 

2H

for two-, three- and four-electron atomic and molecular systems [6-15]. In Refs. [16] and [17], 

we  established  the  general  formulae  for  the  multicenter-multielectron  integrals  over  integer 

and  noninteger 

n

  STOs  (ISTOs  and  NISTOs)  with  an  arbitrary  s-electron  operator

exponential  type  orbitals,  respectively.  These  integrals  arise  in  the  solution  of  multielectron 

atomic and molecular problems when a Hylleraas approximation in the Hartree-Fock theory is 

employed. 

   In a recent paper in this journal, Özdoğan [18] published the formulas for the evaluating of 

multielectron  multicenter  integrals  over  NISTOs.  In  this  Comment  we  demonstrate  that  the 

results published by this author in multielectron multicenter integrals are not original and can 

be derived from the formulas published in our papers [16, 19-22]. It should be noted that the 

work of Özdoğan [18] is on the use of formulas presented in Refs.[23-16], which are obtained 

from  our  papers  by  changing  the  summation  indices  or  application  of  a  simple  algebra  (see 

   The published in Ref.[18] formulas in multielectron multicenter molecular integrals can be 

obtained from our papers [16,19-22] basic formulas of which are presented in the following

4. Application to one-electron molecular integrals over NISTOs  

    4.1. Two-center overlap integrals 

In order to derive the expression for evaluation of overlap integrals over NISTOs in terms of 

overlap integrals with ISTOs we should use the expansion formulas (1). Then, we get Eq.(17) 

of  Ref.[18].  The  analytic  formulae  for  two-center  overlap  integrals  of  NISTOs  and  ISTOs 

have been published in our papers (see  e.g.,  Ref.[21]).  The  published  by  Özdoğan  formulas 

for  two-center  overlap  integrals  are  obtained  from  our  results  by  changing  the  summation 

indices (see Comment [28]). 

    4.2 Two-center nuclear attraction integrals 

(
,A BU

)

 

Eq.(20)  of  Ref.[18]  for  integrals 

  is  obtained  with  the  help  of  one-center  expansion 

(
,A BU

)

formula  (1)  of  this  Comment.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  two-center  nuclear  attraction 

integrals 

(

)AU  and 

(

)BU are reduced to the two-center overlap integrals (see Comment [29]). 

    4.2 Three-center nuclear attraction integrals 

Eq.(22) of Ref.[18] for three-center nuclear attraction integrals is also obtained by taking into 

account the one-center expansion formula (1). It should be noted that the three-center nuclear 

attraction integrals over NISTOs and ISTOs have been published by us in Ref.[22]. 

5. Application to two-electron molecular integrals over NISTOs 

Eqs.(23)-(31)  of  published  by  Özdoğan  paper  [18]  can  be  easily  derived  from  formulas  (6) 

and (8) of this Comment for the special case of two-electron operator 

F

. The results 

( )2

=

1
r

for  the  evaluation  of  multicenter  two-electron  integrals  with  ISTOs  and  NISTOs  have  been 

given in Ref.[16]. 

    As  can  be  seen  from  the  formulas  given  in  this  Comment  and  in  Ref.[18],  all  of  the 

formulas  published  by  Özdoğan  for  the  evaluation  of  multielectron  multicenter  molecular  

integrals over NISTOs and ISTOs are available in our papers or they can easily be derived by 

means of a simple algebra. It should be noted that the formulas presented in [23-27] for the 

calculation  of  two-center  overlap  and  nuclear  attraction  integrals  over  STOs  in  nonlined-up 

and  lined-up  coordinate  systems  can  also  be  derived,  as  shown  in  Comments  [28-30],  from 

the use of established in our papers formulas.

F.A. Hovsepian (Moscow) 

 
 

1. Introduction 

            This paper discusses an ordinary homogeneous differential equation of the second order with 

constant real-valued coefficients. It is one of the three equations describing the motion of a celestial 

body of natural origin in the Euclidean space. The y(t) solution of this equation has to satisfy additional 

conditions which are very significant in the author’s opinion and which, so far, have escaped attention 

of the researchers.  

            The first of the conditions stems from the analytical research results of numerous scientists and 

many years of astronomic observations confirming the stability of the celestial body motion. Since 

stable motion in nature is rotational, normally consideration is given to a bounded second-order 

equation with the coefficient of the first derivative y(t) equal to zero. This paper discusses only an 

asymptotically stable solution of the y(t) equation which is needed from the theoretical point of view as 

well, since in what follows the solution is Fourier’s expansion. 

            The second condition is based on the fact that nature does not know of such notions as left or 

right, up or down. Consequently, y(t) for t ≥ 0 is reflected with respect to t ≤ 0, i.e. an even function is 

obtained  v(τ)  →  0  for  τ  →  ±  ∞,  and  the  continuous  differentiability  of  function  v  (τ)  for  τ  =  0  is 

maintained via two starting conditions that the researcher has at his disposal. Consequently, function v 

(τ) is a solution of two second order equations which differ one from the other by the first derivative 

sign.  

            It is well known that Fourier’s transform of v(τ) is 

V(ω) = 

v(τ)exp(−iωτ)dτ.

In the case considered V(ω) has several very important properties. First, V(ω) due to the even v(τ) is 

a real valued function. Second, function V(ω) = V(−ω) ≥ 0 for all ω, i.e. this function is the probability 

density of a random value. Hence, the expansion of the function  

v(τ) = 2 ∫

∞

V(ω)cosωτ dω 

has  an  important  physical  meaning  which  can  be  ascribed  to  it  based  on  the  known  Khinchine’s 

theorem  [1]:  v(τ)  −  is  an  autocorrelation  function  of  a  continuous  stationary  random  process  ξ(t). 

Consequently,  the  argument  τ  of  this  function  is  a  time  interval  between  sections  of  this  process  at 

arbitrary times t1 and t2: 

τ = t1 – t2.

Note that in a conventional solution y(t), t = 0  is a point, however, in the solution v(τ) for τ = 0 we 

have current time t, which lasts from minus to plus infinity. This is one of the two significant results of 

this paper and the proof is given in theorem 1. 

        Theorem 2 has an auxiliary role and is needed for the future research. It proves that the function 

v(τ) can be twice differentiated under the integral with respect to τ as a parameter. Substituting v(τ) in 

the second order equation for τ ≥ 0 and having differentiated twice this function under the integral we 

obtain an identity with several remarkable properties.  

            The first property of the identity implies that a change in the scale of the integration variable, 

i.e. a substitution  

results in a change of the scale for τ so that the product stays unchanged:  

This is proved in theorem 3.  

            The  second  property  of  this  identity  consists  in  the  fact  that  a  change  in  the  sign  of  the 

frequency ω changes the sign of τ. Consequently, in 

ω =

when expanding limits of integration with respect to ω from −∞ to ∞  the function sinωτ «behaves» as 

an even function, and this makes the integrand odd. This property can be utilized after obtaining 

through the use of Dirac’s δ−functions of the following solution  

vm(τ) = 

 [δ1(Ω − ω) + δ2(Ω + ω)]  V(

mdv ( )

 ≡ 0, 

which is proved in Theorem 4. This condition «by-passes» the first derivative coefficient in the second 

order equation and we obtain an equation which looks like the one describing oscillations. From the 

interval (−∞, ∞) through the use of vm(τ) oscillations of all frequencies except for are ω = 0 are 

identified and, as a result, we have the following situation. On the one hand, the function vm(τ) is 

oscillation cosΩτ, in which possible values of the random value Ω are discrete and equal to ±ω, i.e. an 

oscillating body behaves as a particle. On the other hand, however, the random value Ω can be treated 

 

 

2

as continuous since all its possible values are frequencies from the probability density spectrum V(ω) 

(ω ≠ 0), i.e. an oscillating body behaves as a wave.  

This corresponds to the corpuscular-wave dualism for radiation introduced in physics by Louis de 

Broglie. Based on this the present author identifies the oscillations as white light. The result presents 

            1. It has not been known in physics the nature of light generation. We have an answer to this 

dual interest: 

question now.  

            2. The absolute time t has been assumed to be an argument in harmonic oscillations which 

represent light. The present result refutes this assumption. An argument here is the time interval τ 

between sections of a stationary random process ξ(t), which changes radically the idea of the Universe 

composition and the processes taking place in it. Light is the correlation function of the process ξ(t), on 

the one hand, and manifestation of Euclidean and stationary Universe, on the other hand. 

            If the Universe were stationary, it could not have had processes like spreading out of galaxies, 

observed  by  astronomers.  In  paragraph  3,  among  other  things,  this  issue  is  also  discussed  using  the 

example of an equation with a parameter which can assume various values, thus offering a possibility 

to compare various differential equations.  

            The author’s results of [2, 3] are heavily used in the article.

differential equation with constant real-valued coefficients of the second order  with initial conditions

            Then the function v(τ), which consists of y(t) for t ≥ 0 and y(t) evenly extended to t < 0 is a 

correlation function of a continuous stationary process.  

            Proof. The solution y(t) of the second order differential equation is determined by pair of roots 

ρ1 and ρ2 considered below. 

i.e.  

            1. Let the solution y(t) be determined by a pair of complex-conjugated numbers ρ1,2 = − χ ± iλ, 

which, taking into account the initial conditions, can be rewritten as  

y1(t) = (Аcosλt + Bsinλt)exp(−χt),

Consider y1(t) for t ≥ 0 and substitute t for  − s, rewriting it as follows 

                                               y 1*(s) = y 1(−s). 

Obtain an even function  

The Fourier transform V1(iω) of the function v1(t) is equal to  

v1(t) = y 1*(t) for t ≤ 0,       v1(t) = y 1(t) for t ≥ 0. 

V1(iω) = 

v1(t)exp(−iωt)dt =

Since we agreed that y 1*(−s) = y 1(s), then the integrals in V1(iω) differ only in the sign ω, hence, their 

sum is a real-valued function which permits rewriting the Fouruir transform of the function v1(t) as

y3(t) = Aexp(−χt) + Btexp(−χt), 

.             y3(t) = exp(−χt) + χtexp(−χt). 

In this case too one can obtain an even function v3(t) following the above rule. The bilateral Fourier

            The substitution resulted in the following changes:  

            −  in  the  function  V1(ω)  prior  to  the  substitution  we  had  parameters    λ  and  χ,  after  the 

substitution we have in the function

χ1 = αχ,   λ1 = αλ; 

            −  a  characteristic  equation  corresponding  to  the  differential  equation  (2.2)    prior  to  the 

substitution was  

                                               η2 + aη + b = 0, 

while, after the substitution it became 

                                               η2 + αaη + α2b = 0. 

Consequently, the variable substitution resulted in changed values of coefficients a and b in the equation 
(2.2)  and  they  are  now  equal  to  αa  and  α2b.  These  changes  are  not  possible  since  coefficients  in  a 

differential equation are specified. Therefore the argument τ in v1(τ) should also change so that in (2.2) 

the coefficients remain unchanged. Hence, taking into account the notation in

 In this statement the problem is known in the theory of motion stability as the problem of absolute 

stability. Since ϕ(y) is arbitrary, we will treat cases when ϕ(y) = 0 and ϕ(y) = ky, which present a 

special interest, since correlation functions according to theorem 1 can be obtained only for a linear 

equation

            Note, that theoretical results are in no way linked to this equation, however, its use facilitates 

considerably further explanation, as becomes obvious from what follows.  

            According to Newton, motion in the Universe is described by three equations of the second 

order, while (3.2)  is an equation of the sixth order, i.e. using the roots (3.2) one can always obtain the 

three equations required.  

            Any equation which describes motion of material bodies, also in the Universe, is nonlinear, for 

the Universe, this equation should also be asymptotically stable which is confirmed by many years of 

astronomic observations. Hence, the author assumes that this motion can be described qualitatively as 

(3.1), and it is required to obtain the value of the maximal k, when this linear equation (3.2) is 

asymptotically stable, since only then correlation functions according to theorem 1 can be obtained. 

We will come back to the discussion of this issue in what follows, for now we note that for k = 0 we 

obtain an equation for the case when there are no material bodies. In this case in a three-dimensional 

space any of the second-order equations should be the same since not a single Cartesian coordinate has 

any advantages a priori. In equation (3.2) this condition is satisfied.  

            Consider a case when ϕ(y) = 0 in (3.1) or, which is the same, k = 0 in (3.2):

Roots in this equation are complex-conjugated, let us denote their parameters as χ ± iλ (for 

convenience of reading all designations are identical to the ones used in theorem 1). Along with the 

solution

            Function v1(τ) by  virtue of theorem 1 is an auto-correlation function of a stationary random

The solution vm(τ1) is in fact a monochromatic oscillation cosΩτ1, in which Ω is a random variable of a 

new type: 

            a) according to the probability theory Ω is a discrete random value, since possible values of Ω = 

± ω, where all frequencies in pairs from the spectrum 

1V (

)ω , except for ω = 0;  

            b) possible values of Ω  are all frequency values from the spectrum of the probability density 

1V (

)ω , i.e. Ω  is a continuous random value. 

The solution (3.8) represents harmonic oscillations of any frequencies which can be treated as waves, 

when Ω  is a continuous value. However, they can be also treated as particles, when Ω is a discrete 

value. Note that we discussed the equation (3.2) for k = 0, i.e. equation of motion in the absence of 

material bodies in the Universe. Today  it is known that harmonic oscillations characterized by 

 

13

corpuscular-wave dualism are called light. Besides, photons indeed do not have mass at rest. This leads 

to a statement that (3.5), (3.8) and (3.9) are the equation, the solution and the property of white light 

accordingly. 

            It has to be noted that we also have here substantial differences with what is known in physics: 

          a) harmonic oscillations which we identify as light are a correlation function of a stationary 

random process ξ(t); 

             b) an argument in these oscillations is  

τ = t2 − t1 

a time interval between sections ξ(t) at arbitrary times t1 и t2 . Since light and electromagnemtic wave 

are of the same nature, we can state almost surely  that an argument in Maxwell’s equations should also 

be τ, i.e. electromagnetic wave equations and light equations are equations of the electromagnetic field 

with the same argument τ. In its turn electromagnetic field is a feature of stationary and Euclidean 

Universe. 

            To obtain correlation functions using roots of equation (3.2) for any k ≠ 0, we must obtain the 

maximal value of k, when the real-valued part of the roots is negative which is necessary for obtaining 

this function according to theorem 1. This problem can be solved using the Nyquist criterion, and to do 

that (3.2) is to be treated as a system with input ky and output −y, i.e.

The characteristic W(iω) starts on a positive real-valued semi-axis of the complex plane W and runs six 

quadrants sequentially. According to Nyquist  the roots in (3.2) have negative real-valued parts for k ∈ 

[0, ∞), since the frequency characteristic does not cross the negative real-valued axis.

            Since we discuss equation (3.2) in the parameter space, then k is treated as «distance» of the 

 

            There is no analytical method to obtain the roots of equation (3.2) for an arbitrary k ≠ 0. Hence 

they were obtained by modeling. For an arbitrary k roots in (3.2) are complex-conjugated. When k →

Consequently, out of two pairs of roots the real-valued part tends to zero, and the imaginary part tends

which can be obtained using the frequency characteristic (it is a frequency at which W(iω) crosses the 

origin of coordinates). The modeling results facilitate a lot the exercise since correlation functions are 

to be obtained for only one type of roots in accordance with the theorem 1 

            Consider equation (3.2) and find out up to what value of k correlation functions can be obtained 

according to theorem 1. The correlation function is a positive definited function [5]. Consequently, the 

trivial solution of the equation (3.2) must be the positive definited function too.  It imposes for  the 

roots of the equation (3.2)  more stringent conditions than just  negative real part. Without going into 

the details we only  note that the correlation function can be obtained for k ∈ [0, kcr], when the 

complex plane W can be divided by a straight line into two parts so that the whole of W(iω) lies strictly 

to the right of this line, and the abscissa −

 of the limit line is minimally  separated from the origin 

1

15

of the coordinates [3]. This straight line and the value of kcr are shown in Fig. 2. This implies that for 

an arbitrary k we have a light equation up  k = kcr.  

            Boundary of asymptotic motion stability, according to the nonlinear equation obviously cannot 

be more than kcr. It can be proved that within a galaxy the stability boundary of the nonlinear equation 

(3.1) coincides with the light equation boundary in the linear equation.  

            Parameters of complex-conjugated roots of equation (3.2) when k changes to k = kcr are not 

known to us analytically, however, white light equations with their solution and the features of that 

solution are going to be similar to that of (3.5), (3.8) and (3.9), obtained for k = 0. Moreover, the light 

equation we will derive from the equations describing the motion of the Solar system, and the Earth is 

part of the System. 

            Experiments by  Mickelson – Morley in 1887 can be treated as the experimental confirmation 

of the fact that light is ether which fills the space, hence it is not possible to detect the motion of the 

Earth through ether with the help of light.  

            Correlation functions obtained for various values of k in (3.2) will behave similar to the 

function v1(τ) in (3.7).  This implies that the argument τ will “narrow down” or “expand” with the help 

of an arbitrary α. Variation of τ in the function v1(τ) results in a similar change of the argument t in the 

function y1(t). In an ordinary differential equation (3.3) no transformation of (3.7) is done, since, first, 

this leads to a change of an independent argument t: if t does not depend on us, then we should not try 

change it. Second, and this is not acceptable either, (3.7) changes coefficients of this equation, 

determined by the Newton’s laws. However, it is one thing when (3.7) is done artificially, but it is quite 

different when such transformation is a result of the integration variable substitution. Let us consider 

this problem when the complex-conjugated root in the equation loses its real-valued part (χ = 0). This 

situation can be obtained from theorem 3, when in the function

   χ1 = αχ, λ1 = αλ, 

χ1 → 0. One can easily see that the numerator will be zero. The denominator, however, will also be 

zero since for an arbitrary α there is always a frequency when λ1 = αλ = ±ω1. Consequently, finding 

the value of an indeterminate of the type 

, we obtain δ−functions which are easy to integrate. As a 

0
0

result, we obtain an above family of equations (3.5) with the only difference being that for χ1 ≠ 0 the 

first derivative coefficient was by-passed due to (3.9), and now the coefficient will just be equal to 

zero. Let us write down this family of equations in a general form (not following the example of (3.5), 

since the case when χ1 = 0 is not possible), i.e.

where µ is a constant value which is a function of masses M and m, while

and there are no masses of any moving bodies. Consequently, I. Newton, having developed the 

differential calculus ascribed to an arbitrary coefficient α2b a specific value, based on the observations 

by Kepler. This implies that the Newton’s law of universal gravitation is only a model describing the 

motion of material bodies in a stationary environment. Note that a priority frame of reference for 

Newton’s equations in a stationary environment can be any system of coordinates established 

anywhere. Here is what an eminent physicist C.Lanczos [6] wrote about it: «What is after all, a “frame 

of reference” ? Coould it be more than a man-made artifice, an axilliary  tool we have manufactured in 

orger to describe the physical universe? Why should we not have the right to relate our measurements 

to any arbitrary frame of axes we may choose? These axes do not belong to the objective world order. 

We set up our axes as a kind of scaffold in order to walk on it and be able to reach any part of the 

building. Yet we must be aware of the fact that this scaffold is not part of building. It can be put up and 

pulled down without altering the building in the least. But in Newton’s physics the pecular thing 

happened that an absolute frame was designated (not entirely, since a stricly uniformmmm moution 

relative to it was tolerand) as the only correct frame to which our measurements should be related». 

Stationary environment can be compared to an ocean when it is completely calm. This does not mean, 

however, that there is no motion in a ocean. On the contrary, an ocean at any moment in time will 

always have waves of all frequencies. In the ocean we can establish an arbitrary system of coordinates 

described by Newton when introducing the notion of absolute space. This system of coordinates does 

not have anything to do with the stationary environment. It is just a convenient frame of reference for 

our calculations. We can easily dispose of them since they are not part of our ocean. This has become 

possible due to discovery of a new and important physical property of the solution of Newton’s 

equations, it offers an absolutely novel angle from which to view the processes taking place in the 

Universe.  

                  A stationary random process ξ(t) in our case can be presented as harmonic oscillations 

with ω ∈ (0, ∞), and random values  α  and  β  described as follows: 

σ(t) =  α cosωt +  β sinωt,

Function σ(t), similar to its correlation function K(τ) =  b cosωτ,  is a solution of equation (3.5), since 

the change of the sign of the frequency ω also changes the sign of time t, hence, similar to (3.9),

            Consider now the notion of absolute time introduced by Newton. This is what he wrote about it: 

«Absolute, True and Mathematical Time, of itself and from its nature flows equably without regard to 

any thing external, and by another name is called Duration...». Let us prove, that t does not have this 

property and to do so we will write equality (2.5) from theorem 3 as follows 

 ωτ = 

= ω1τ1 = C1,                                         (3.11) 

ω
1 ατ
1
α

where C1 depends on numeric values of ω and τ, and this C1 can be specified in advance since ω and τ 

are arbitrary. Since t1 and t2 are arbitrary in  

τ = t2 –  t1 

changes in τ in (3.11) with the use of α lead to similar changes of t1 and  t2 , i.e. 

                                             ατ = α(t1 –  t2) = αt1 –  αt2, 

and, consequently, to «expansion» or «narrowing down» of time t. Hence, it immediately follows that t 

does not have the property of being independent which Newton ascribed to it. 

            The Universe, however, has not only our Galaxy but other galaxies too, and all of them co-exist 

in the same space. Consider a case when the light from a galaxy arrives at our Galaxy, and, 

consequently, to the Solar system. It is assumed that motion of any galaxy is described by an equation 

of type (3.2), however, with different constant values T1 and T, hence, different galaxies have different 

values of kcr.  Let us denote: for our Galaxy kcr = kG, for any other galaxy kcr = kg and consider the 

equation of motion of our Galaxy (3.2) for k = kcr = kG. Let us obtain a second-order equation

passed”, and the coefficient b must be multiple to α2, i.e.. we can consider a second-order equation

this is why they are marked with asterisk. For the same reason the corresponding solutions are also 

marked with asterisk. For this identity we can write a second-order identity, however, with an arbitrary

Since kg can take any value let us assume that kg < kG. This value of kg can be “reduced” to kG using 

the parameter α:

As already mentioned above with respect to roots of equation (3.2), the rise of k results in the lowering 

of the parameter χ, which in the limit tends to zero with the parameter k tending to infinity. Hence, to 

“reduce” kg   to kG (for learning we must compare) we need in accordance with theorem 3 take α < 1 

for kg < kG. After the “reduction” the solutions of the original and the “reduced” equations in a general 

case obviously differ, due to scale changes that roots and arguments have to undergo. However, since 

both equations are equations of light and the systems of rotation described by these equations are in the 

same space, then light from a galaxy gets into the Galaxy, and hence, to the Solar system too. If α < 1, 

then the process of “reduction” leads to lower frequency and color shift towards the red in the Doppler 

spectrum. This may lead to an erroneous conclusion that Universe accelerates, and the lower kg, the 

faster, since in that case there is more reddening. In a case when kg > kG, to the contrary, the process of 

“reduction” leads to a greater frequency and the Doppler shift towards the blue. This can be 

erroneously interpreted as a galaxy rushing towards us, and the larger kg the faster.

Summary 

REFERENCES 

            The above results show that the language of the Universe physics differs from that of the 

physics of the Earth. The latter is based on non stationary processes, while the physics of the Universe 

relies on stationary processes. Hence, the study of the Universe has to be approached differently from 

the way it is done.

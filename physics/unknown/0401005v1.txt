Abstract

We summarise and discuss some of our previous results,(7-10) which show
that Bohr’s theory of the one-electron atom(13, 14) may be derived from the
theory underpinning Quantum ElectroDynamics (QED)(18) or vice versa,
and that General Relativity(19) may also be derived from QED theory in
the classical limit, if we use Newtonian mechanics(21, 24) in the right frame
and self-similar tesseral hierarchies.(4-6, 17) We circumvent Newton’s
arguments(24) against Descartes’ vortex theory(16) to show that the inverse
square law for a force(24) combined with the equation of circular
motion(24) and Bohr’s quantisation of angular momentum(13, 14) may be
derived from the vortex theory(16, 24) and Special Relativity.(19) We remark

on the electro-weak interaction, the number of dimensions needed, and
their connection with tesseral hierarchies.(4-6, 8, 10, 17)

2. The four-vector spinor

We have shown that the particle version of QED theory applied to

electromagnetism, comprising the Dirac equation(18) and Maxwell’s
equations(12) for the photon, can be reproduced with the spinor behaving
like a four-vector.(7) We shall call Maxwell’s equations collectively, in

the form of an equation for the potential, the radiation equation.

The Dirac equation in the form required for demonstrating this

behaviour is(7)

we take M as the energy-momentum four-vector, FF must behave like a

four-vector as well for Special Relativity to be observed, withftraversing

3. Bohr’s equations and electromagnetic particles

This leads to the question: “Can QED theory be applied in the

classical case?” We tried Bohr’s semi-classical theory of the one-electron
atom(13, 14) in part 1 of Bell et al.,(8) which we will call part 1. Bohr

defined his model using two equations for the charged particle. These

were,

(i)

the particle obeys Newton’s equation of circular motion (24) in the

frame of the source of attraction,

(ii)

the angular momentum of the particle, again in the frame of the

source, must be an integer multiple of

.2ph

We used a version of Bohr’s theory (14) in which the particle’s mass was

allowed to vary in conformity with Special Relativity. Bohr’s equations

are then

in the frame of the source, where Ze is the charge on the source, R is the

distance between the particle and the source, the Bohr radius,

ev is the

We introduced the Circular transformation,(8) which turned linear

motion into circular motion and an inverse-distance potential into a

constant one. This cylindrical symmetry was reached by pinching lines

parallel to the x-axis into radii meeting at the origin, while lines parallel

to the y-axis became the corresponding circles. After performing the

Circular transformation, the Dirac equation, (2.A), was solved to give

the arc and 0A is the potential in the frame of the source. Using a Lorentz

transformation from the frame of the particle in the space formed by the

Circular transformation, we showed that the motion satisfied Bohr’s first

equation, (3.A). Bohr’s second equation followed from the requirement

that FF be single-valued for spatial co-ordinates. This only held in general

if FF behaved like a four-vector.

We proved the inverse in part 2 of Bell et al.,(8) which we will call

part 2. Using Bohr’s equations, we found a set of solutions of the Dirac

and radiation equations describing miniature Bohr atoms at each point in

spacetime. Each atom was composed of a small part of the wave function

of the particle and the charge density of the source. The relation between

the variables at a point, was

where A is the potential. The complete solution for particular boundary

conditions could be found by solving the Dirac and radiation equations.

4. Bohr’s equations and tachyons

Bohr’s equations, (3.A), only give the principal energy levels.

Sommerfeld supplied the missing fine structure by admitting elliptical
orbits.(25) This model gives the same energy levels as Dirac obtained by
solving the Dirac equation,(18) although each gives different labels for

them. A circular projection may be obtained from an ellipse, and we
chose to use circles.(9) We considered a circular orbit split into two
circular components occupying orthogonal planes in spacetime.(9, 10) The

circumference of each component could be thought of as the orbit of a

Bohr atom in its own right. The first atom was formed from the original

particle and a source in the previous way. The circular temporal co-

ordinate formed the orbit of a second, notional, atom, whose matching

temporal co-ordinate was the orbit of the original atom. Both the Dirac

and radiation equations are invariant when transformed to a frame in

which a particle becomes a tachyon, as in the second atom, and this

continues to be true when FF transform like a four-vector. We added the

contributions made to the energy by the original atom and the copy in the
frame of the source,(9)

where rn is the equivalent of qn for the copy. We show in section 8 that we

may derive the inverse square law for the force from Bohr’s second
equation alone, which we obtained for the copy.(10) The original and the

copy could be combined into a structure showing spatial spherical
symmetry, with a new, third, temporal co-ordinate.(9) With this temporal

co-ordinate, equation (4.A) described the spectrum we see,

We extended our previous derivation of QED theory in part 2 to include
the copy, showing that this too leads to QED theory.(9)

5. Bohr’s equations from a metric

We examined whether General Relativity could be expressed in this

language.(10) We described the circular motion of a particle in a curved

represents Newton’s law of gravity. (24)qis the angle swept out in the

rational. Then, from equations (5.B),

6. Hierarchical Bohr’s equations and gravity

We showed that the interaction(22) inside the thin gravitational shell

predicted by General Relativity(19) could also be described by Bohr’s
equations in a flat moving space and that the angle swept out was .q (10)

We ascribed the interaction in the last section to the outside of the shell

where it could be seen as a tachyonic transformation of the internal one.

Since both can be described using a moving space, the outside could also

be seen as the inside of a another shell with the same centre. Iterating, we

may imagine the second shell surrounded by a third and so on and the

inside containing another shell, which contained another shell and so on,

like an infinite series of Russian dolls. Our results could be tabulated so

that part of the infinite series reads:

The second column gave the mass of the source and particle. The fourth

gave the velocity of rotation and the fifth showed the relations between

the quantum numbers of shell. Not all shells could be quantised

simultaneously. Bohr’s equations applied inside and outside each shell,

and the physics could therefore be described using the Dirac and radiation

equations in the space between two shells. The method of iteration, in

which the wave accompanying the particle for one level became the

position vector of the particle in the next, could be usefully described by a
tiling or tesseral hierarchy,(4-6, 17) which we discuss further in section 8.

We showed that the tesseral hierarchies applied in the quantum
electromagnetic case,(10) as follows.

We may assemble a metric for a curved space that is

Bohr’s equations, (3.A), for the interaction between a particle and this

source, then follow from Bohr’s equations, (5.C), and the second of

equations (5.B) with

,sm gv and gh replaced by ,se

ev and h, respectively. We

use the same procedure for quantisation as we used for gravity,(10) except

that we suppose em acquires a factor

on moving to the frame of

the source, while h is already defined in this frame. The Circular

transformation could be derived by assuming that the circumference of

circles centred on the origin suffered a contraction proportional to their
radii.(8) If, in addition, the temporal co-ordinate suffers a similar dilation,

we may suppose that both are caused by movement. The temporal, s, and

a spatial, r, co-ordinate swapped each time we stepped up or down the
table,(10) and we suppose that electromagnetism and gravity apply to an

odd and an even shell, respectively. The appropriate Lorentz factor

which is the metric predicted by General Relativity for the exterior of a

spherical source of gravitation. We suppose that we are in space 2 for

gravity. Other ways of performing this calculation are given by Bell and
Diaz.(10) To return to General Relativity, we must imagine that the thin
shell studied by Kuchar(22) and using canonical quantisation, by, for
example, Berezin,(11) must be double, a single thin shell surrounded by

another thin shell with the same centre. We reproduce their findings, in

the limit as the two shells approach each other, excepting that for them

the double shell expands or contracts, while here it spins. The temporal

circumference of the shell and a radial co-ordinate may be interchanged,

since this is another example of a transformation to a frame in which the

particle becomes a tachyon.

7. General Relativity in the general case

Our account so far(7-10) has not included the full generality of
Einstein’s equation, (19) but only those instances where the energy-

momentum-stress tensor may be represented by an energy-momentum

Sarah Bell

12

24th November 2003

Quantising general relativity using QED theory – overview

four-vector. However, this did not limit the domain of the quantum theory
to these instances.(10) When Einstein created General Relativity, he chose

classical behaviour for the tensor on the grounds that insufficient was

known about the actual interaction between particles, so he said in 1922
and afterwards.(19) In the case of quantum theory in the first twenty or so
years of the 20th century he was clearly correct since quantum

electrodynamics had not yet arrived. However, formulae giving statistical

explanations for some classical laws, for example, the idea that pressure

might be due to the impact of many particles, had already been found by
Boltzmann and others during the 19th century.(15) Here electromagnetic

forces are enlarged upon to explain, for example, the kinetic theory of

gases. If we borrow this statistical theory, we may account for other more

general instances of the tensor as being the collective behaviour of

individual particles, each described by an energy-momentum four-vector.

In this way the behaviour of electromagnetism and gravity may be made

parallel. We have the same quantum theory for individual particles and

the same generalisations for collections.

For example, the condition that the tensor is formed from a

collection of four-vectors can be written(10)

km must then be chosen so that the kf are positive. This might

require km to be negative, but this is permitted.(10) No new principles are

involved in extending from a two-dimensional to a four-dimensional

moving space and other approaches are also possible.

8. History, physics and philosophy

Finally, since this is a conference on physical interpretations, we lay

to rest the enmity between those ancient adversaries, Newton and
Descartes. In book 2, propositions 52, 53 and the succeeding scholium,(24)

Newton models fluid flow round a central spherical rotating body, given

surroundings with spherical symmetry. Newton then discusses Descartes’
vortex theory,(16) objecting that the vortex in such a fluid has a period

proportional to the square of the distance from the centre of the sphere,

while for gravity in the limit of increasingly rarefied air the period for a

circular orbit is proportional to the distance to the power three halves.

Further, he extends his argument to elliptical flow and objects that a fluid

would flow faster at the aphelion of an ellipse than at the perihelion in

circumstances which occur in our solar system. We have overcome the

latter objection here by finding a sections through of  spacetime in which

the ellipse becomes a circle, while the conflict described in the former

vanishes if we assume both of Bohr’s equations, (5.C). The fluid obeys

Bohr’s second equation, while the rarefied air obeys Bohr's first, both in

the frame of the source. We note that the satellites of larger bodies in the
solar system do obey both equations approximately.(26)

Indeed, it is possible to derive both of equations (5.C) from a single

proposition about a fluid on the assumption that the circular motion of a

particle behaves in the way we described, splitting into two everywhere

orthogonal circular components, with one circumference temporal and the
other spatial.(8-10) We assume Newton’s equation for the vortex in the

frame of the particle,

rv =p2

k

where r is the radius, v the velocity of the particle and fluid and k is

constant. We call this the vortex equation. We split the circumference

into two circular components in two orthogonal planes in spacetime,

we obtain Bohr’s equations, (3.A) and (5.C). If we introduce curvature,

the vortex described in the first of equations (8.A) can be specified using

the co-ordinates for a single plane, leaving the second plane, described by

the second equation, free for a spatial attraction governed by the

geometrical properties of rays and the kinematical laws of circular
motion(21, 24) in a flat two or three-dimensional space.(8, 9) We assumed a

two-dimensional space, retrieving the third dimension from the radius of
the vortex in the first equation,(7-10) but we could have insisted on a

separate dimension instead, as in the de Sitter Universe, a five-

dimensional sphere with spacetime as the surface.

Returning to the assumptions made throughout previously,(7-10) we

conjecture that we may introduce a second index into the Dirac and

radiation equations to describe the behaviour of 1k and 2k in a second copy

of spacetime, each with four dimensions. We might hope for a link with

the electro-weak theory in that case, since, if we associate 1k with the

temporal component and gravity,

2k may have three components, inviting

comparison. This implies the unification of h and gh  for each of the

spaces between the shells in the original spacetime. If we wish to

represent the scaling Bohr orbits as well, within a single theory, we may

use tiles of different levels in a duplex tesseral hierarchy in four
dimensions like the Hyper-cube or Hyper-HoR hierarchy.(3) The patterned
tiles(23) may be addressed and changed using the arithmetic.(3, 8, 9) We

conjecture that, instead, we might succeed in relating only

electromagnetism and gravity using a single tesseral hierarchy by

considering series of scaling Bohr orbits and scaling sets of series.

Newton also discusses the vortex of a fluid with cylindrical

symmetry in, book 2, proposition 51.(24) Here he finds that the velocity of

rotation is constant so that the period is proportional to the distance from

the axis of symmetry. We have already determined in part 1 that in

moving from the space formed by the Circular transformation back to the

original, we should multiply distances measured along the rotating
circumference by the length of the radius. We showed in Bell and Diaz(10)

and in section 6 here that this could be seen as equivalent to removing a

Lorentz contraction. This meant that we should also remove a Lorentz

dilation from temporal components like the period in going from
Newtonian mechanics to invariance under Special Relativity.(21, 24) This

does not keep the velocity of rotation constant. If, however, the same

factor could be applied to both the spatial and temporal components, it

would. Work in progress shows that such a change can be induced if we
 rather than the Minkowski signature,

use a Euclidean signature,

 for spacetime. Appearances can still be saved, since the Dirac

and radiation equations remain invariant. Then Newton’s model of a

cylindrical vortex would fit the cylindrical model used in part 1 and

discussed in section 3 here.

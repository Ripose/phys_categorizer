Abstract 

Since the beginning of the 20th century, the correlation in the 11-year solar cycle between the 

sunspot  number  and  geomagnetic  aa-index  has  been  decreasing,  while  the  lag  between  the 

two has been increasing. We show how this can be used as a proxy for the Sun’s meridional 

circulation, and investigate the long-term changes in the meridional circulation and their role 

for solar activity and terrestrial climate.

Introduction 

It has long been known that solar activity is the source of geomagnetic disturbances (See e.g. 

Cliver  (1994)  for  a  review),  so  geomagnetic  activity  is  often  viewed  as  a  proxy  for  solar 

activity.  For  quantifying  the  long-term  variations  in  geomagnetic  activity,  aa-index  is 

commonly  used  because  this  is  the  index  with  the  longest  available  record  –  since  1868 

(Mayaud, 1972).  

Geomagnetic  activity  as  measured  by  aa-index  has  been  steadily  increasing  since  the 
beginning of the 20th century. Clilverd et al. (1998) studied all possible causes of this long-

term increase and concluded that it could only be due to the variations in the interplanetary 

space and thus in the Sun. Lockhood et al. (1999), based on this increase in aa, speculated that 

the magnetic flux leaving the Sun has increased by a factor of 1.4 since 1964, and by a factor 

of  2.3  since  1901.  Given  the  serious  implications  for  the  Sun’s  role  in  global  climate,  the

above conclusion gave rise to severe controversy, until Cliver and Ling (2002) confirmed that 

this increase in the solar magnetic flux is real. 

On the other hand, the correlation between aa-index and sunspot number in the 11-year solar 
cycle has been decreasing since the beginning of the 20th century, while the lag between the 

two has been increasing (Kishcha et al, 1999). Moreover, the long-term correlation between 

aa-index  and  sunspot  number  was  actually  good  only  until  a  few  decades  ago,  after  which 

solar activity remained more or less constant while geomagnetic activity continued increasing 

(Georgieva et al., 2005).  The evolution of the correlation between solar activity and global 

terrestrial temperature is very much the same: until a few decades ago the global temperature 

closely followed the variations in sunspot numbers, while in the last decades sunspot numbers 

remained almost constant while the temperature continued increasing. This gives arguments 

in  favour  of  the  anthropogenic  influences  on  climate  in  the  last  decades  (e.g.  Solanki  and 

Fligge, 1998). However, the similarity of the long-term changes in the correlations between 

sunspot  number  and  terrestrial  temperature,  and  between  sunspot  number  and  aa-index 

implies that they may have a common origin (Georgieva and Kirov, 2006). 

Geomagnetic  disturbances  can  be  caused  by  agents  originating  from  two  different  types  of 

solar  sources:  open  solar  flux  regions,  such  as  coronal  holes  from  which  high  speed  solar 

wind  causing  recurrent  geomagnetic  activity  on  the  declining  and  minimum  phase  of  the 

sunspot  cycle  originates,  and  closed  solar  field  regions  –  sources  of  coronal  mass  ejections 

causing sporadic geomagnetic activity most common around sunspot maximum (Richardson 

et al., 2001). 

Coronal holes are related to the Sun’s large-scale poloidal field, while coronal mass ejections 

are  related  to  the  Sun’s  toroidal  field.  The  cyclic  transformation  of  the  poloidal  field  into 

toroidal field and of this toroidal field into a new poloidal field with the opposite polarity – 

the  solar  dynamo,  is  the  basis  of  solar  activity.  There  are  many  excellent  reviews  on  solar 

dynamo  theory  (see  for  example  http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/  Articles/),  so  we  will 

not go into details of this theory, and will only present some simple explanation. 

In sunspot minimum the Sun’s magnetic field resembles the field of a bar magnet, with field 

lines going out of one pole and entering the other pole. In the regions around the two poles the 

magnetic field lines are open – stretching out into the interplanetary space. These regions are 

the polar coronal holes from which high speed solar wind originates and this high speed solar 

wind, when it hits the Earth’s magnetosphere, gives rise to geomagnetic disturbances. As the 

 

2

coronal  holes  are  long-lived  structures,  the  Earth  encounters  these  high  speed  streams  each 

time when the coronal hole rotates into a position facing the Earth – that is, once every solar 

rotation.  Therefore,  geomagnetic  disturbances  caused  by  high  speed  solar  wind  are 

“recurrent” – reoccurring regularly every 27 days, the period of solar rotation.  

As the solar cycle progresses, the solar differential rotation (higher angular velocities at the 

equator that at the poles) stretches the “poloidal” (meridional) field in azimuthal (East-West) 

direction at the base of the solar convection zone (at about 0.7 R(cid:128)) giving rise to the toroidal 
component  of  the  field  –  a  process  generally  known  as  “Ω–effect”  (Parker,  1955).  The 

buoyant  magnetic  field  tubes  rise  up,  piercing  the  surface  at  two  spots  (sunspots)  with 

opposite magnetic polarities. Because of the toroidal component of the field, the bipolar pair 

of spots is tilted with respect to the meridional plane with the leading (in the direction of solar 

rotation)  spot  at  lower  heliolatitude  than  the  trailing  spot.  In  each  solar  hemisphere,  the 

leading  spot  has  the  polarity  of  the  respective  pole,  and  the  trailing  spot  has  the  opposite 

polarity. 

While this part of the dynamo -  the transformation of the poloidal field into toroidal field - is 

clear, the physical mechanism responsible for the regeneration of the poloidal component of 

the solar magnetic field from the toroidal component (the so called α–effect) has not yet been 

identified with confidence (Charbonneau, 2005). Different classes of mechanisms have been 

proposed. Recently the most promising seems to be the one based on the idea first proposed 

by  Babkock  (1961)  and  mathematically  developed  by  Leighton  (1969):  late  in  the  sunspot 

cycle, the leading spots diffuse across the equator where their flux is canceled by the opposite 

polarity flux of the leading spots in the other hemisphere (Dikpati and Charbonneau, 1999). 

The flux of the trailing spots and of the remaining sunspot pairs is carried toward the poles 

where it accumulates to form the poloidal field of the next solar cycle. As a part of the leading 

spots flux has been canceled, there is an excess of the trailing spots flux, so the new poloidal 

field is with polarity opposite to the one in the preceding cycle.  

This mechanism requires a meridional circulation with a surface flow toward the poles where 

the poloidal flux accumulates, sinks to the base of the solar convective zone, and is carried by 

the  counterflow  there  back  to  low  latitudes  where  it  is  transformed  into  a  toroidal  flux  and 

emerges  as  the  sunspots  of  the  nest  solar  cycle.  The  near-surface  poleward  flux  has  been 

confirmed observationally (Hathaway et  al., 1999, and the references therein; Javaraiah and 

Ulrich, 2006). The deep counterflow has not been yet observed, but can be estimated by the 

 

3

equatorward  drift  of  the  sunspot  occurrence  latitudes  (Hathaway  et  al.,  2003),  though  some 

studies  question  whether  this  is  really  an  evidence  of  a  material  meridional  flow  (Schüssler 

and  Schmitt,  2004).  There  are  some  indications  for  long-term  variations  in  both  the  surface 

and the deep meridional circulation (Hathaway et al., 1999; Javaraiah and Ulrich, 2006), but 

they  are  not  known  for  sure.  Such  long-term  variations  would  be  very  important  for 

understanding the long-term variations in solar and geomagnetic activity. 

Sunspots  are  the  surface  manifestation  of  the  toroidal  magnetic  flux  system  residing  in  the 

solar interior, and thus they provide a long-term record of its variations. Direct measurements 

of  the  poloidal  field  are  available  only  since  1971  (Wang  et  al.,  2000).  As  a  proxy  for  the 

poloidal  field,  the  aa-index  can  be  used.  According  to  (Feynman,  1982),  aa  can  be  divided 

into  two  components,  equally  strong  but  out  of  phase  with  each  other:  one  due  to  solar 

toroidal  field  (aaT)  and  another  due  to  solar  poloidal  field  (aaP).  aaT  is  proportional  to  the 

sunspot  number,    and  aaP  is  simply  what  is  left  of  aa  after  accounting  for  the  contribution 

from the toroidal field (see also Ruzmaikin and Feynman, 2001). 

Echer et al. (2004) suggested that the cause of the decrease in the correlation between sunspot 

number and aa-index may be related to this aa-index dual peak structure. The second aa peak 

related to the high-speed streams seems to have increased relative to the first one related to 

sunspot (coronal mass ejections) activity, the probable cause being that open solar magnetic 

field  structures  (coronal  holes)  have  increased  their  activity  relative  to  the  closed  (sunspot-

related) solar magnetic field structures, which implies different long-term variations in the last 

130  years  of  the  solar  open  and  closed  magnetic  field.  However,  the  variations  in  the  solar 

open and closed flux on such time scales are not known. 

It is the purpose of this study, based on solar and geomagnetic data, to investigate the long-

term variations in the solar meridional circulation, its role for the long-term changes in solar 

and geomagnetic activity, and the long-term variations of their correlation. 

2  Surface meridional circulation 

In 

this 

study  we 

use 

the  monthly 

aa-index 

(ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/ 

GEOMAGNETIC_DATA/AASTAR/)  and 

the  monthly  sunspot  number  values  from 

ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SUNSPOT_NUMBERS/.    Both  data  series  are 

 

 

4

smoothed by 12-month running mean, with a weight of 0.5 for the first and last point, and 1 

for the rest of the points. 

Fig.1  presents  the  smoothed  monthly  values  of  aa-index  (solid  line)  and  sunspot  number 

(broken line) for the period 1868-2005. In the beginning of the period the peak in aa-index is 

at or around sunspot maximum, and later on it begins exhibiting multiple maxima, with the 

principal one occurring on the declining branch of the sunspot cycle. We denote the time in 

months between sunspot maximum and the highest aa maximum on the declining phase of the 

sunspot cycle as “delay-1”. The period between this aa-index maximum and the next sunspot 

maximum is denoted as “delay+1”. 

Delay-1  and  the  amplitude  of  the  sunspot  maximum  are  highly  correlated  (R=0.96  with 
p<1.10-5) when the sunspot maximum is lagged by one cycle. In Fig.2a, the maximum sunspot 

number in each of the 11 consecutive sunspot cycles after 1868 is compared to delay-1 - the 

time  in  months  between  the  maximum  sunspot  number  and  the  following  highest  aa-index 

maximum on the sunspot declining phase of the previous cycle (both 3-point running means). 

The dates along X-axis correspond to the date of the maximum sunspot number, while delay-

1 is shifted forward by one cycle. Interpreting the Babcock-Leighton dynamo mechanism, the 

delay between the sunspot number maximum and the subsequent maximum in the solar polar 

poloidal field should be the time it takes the surface meridional flow to carry the flux from 

low latitudes to the poles after the sunspot maximum. The magnitude of the poloidal field thus 

formed  depends  on  the  speed  of  the  surface  meridional  circulation.  A  slower  circulation 

allows more leading-polarity flux to diffuse across the equator and to cancel with the opposite 

leading-polarity  flux  of  the  other  hemisphere,  thus  leaving  more  trailing-polarity  flux  to  be 

carried to the poles from where it will be transported by the deep meridional circulation back 

to  the  active  latitude  belt  to  emerge  as  the  sunspots  of  the  following  cycle  (Wang,  2004). 

Fig.2b  demonstrates  this  dependence  of  the  high  latitude  poloidal  field  on  the  speed  of  the 

surface meridional circulation: the correlation between delay-1 and the magnitude of the peak 

aa-index as a proxy for the high latitude poloidal field is positive with R=0.65 with p=0.03. 

That is, a slower meridional circulation (bigger delay) leads to a stronger poloidal field and 

hence  to  a  higher  aa-index  maximum.  Further,  a  stronger  poloidal  field  will  be  transformed 

into a stronger toroidal field of the following sunspot cycle. This is the basis of the methods 

for  predicting  the  strength  of  the  following  cycle  from  the  geomagnetic  activity  in  the 

preceding  sunspot  minimum  (Hathaway  et  al.,  1999,  and  the  references  therein).  From  the 

 

5

above  results  it  follows  that  another  possible  predictor  of  the  amplitude  of  the  following 

sunspot  maximum  can  be  the  time  from  the  preceding  sunspot  maximum  to  the  aa-index 

maximum.  As  seen  from  Fig.2a,  cycle  24  can  be  expected  to  be  an  average  cycle  with  the 

number  of  sunspots  in  the  maximum  between  120  and  130,  in  contrast  to  predictions  for  a 

very low (Svalgaard et al., 2005) or a very high maximum (Hathaway and Wilson, 2006). 

From  delay-1  we  can  derive  a  rough  estimation  of  the  speed  of  the  surface  meridional 

circulation. Assuming that the distance traversed by the flow between sunspot maximum and 
aa maximum is from the latitude of sunspot maximum (15o) to the pole, the average speed of 

the  meridional  circulation  in  the  last  sunspot  cycle  was  about  10  m/s.  This  speed  has 

substantial  long-term  variations:  from  above  20  m/s  during  the  low-amplitude  cycles  in  the 
end of the 19th century, to 6 m/s in the secular sunspot maximum cycles. These figures are in 

quite  good  agreement  with  the  results  of  both  feature  tracking  and  direct  Doppler 

measurements  (e.g.  Hathaway,  1996  and  the  references  therein).  It  should  be  noted  that 

sunspot  observations  produce  systematically  lower  values.  See  Javaraiah  and  Ulrich  (2006) 

for a discussion. 

 

 

3     Deep meridional circulation  

Fig.3  presents  the  relation  between  the  magnitude  of  the  sunspot  maximum  and  the  time 

between  this  sunspot  maximum  and  the  preceding  aa-index  maximum  (“delay+1”).  The 

correlation is negative with R=-0.87 with p=0.001. This time is the time for the high latitude 

poloidal flux to sink to the base of the convective zone, to be carried equatorward by the deep 

meridional circulation and to emerge in the active latitude belt as a toroidal field. Fig.3 shows 

that a higher sunspot maximum appears after faster deep meridional circulation (smaller delay 

between  this  sunspot  maximum  and  the  preceding  maximum  in  aa-index).  This  result  is  in 

agreement with the strong positive correlation found by Hathaway et al. (2003) between the 

drift rate of the sunspots toward the equator as a measure of the speed of the meridional flow 

and  the  amplitude  of  the  cycle.  We  however  do  not  find  a  stronger  correlation  with  the 

amplitude  of  the  following  cycle,  or  of  cycle  N+2  (Hathaway  et  al.,  2004).  This  is  not 

necessarily a contradiction because the speed estimated from the sunspots drift rate pertains to 

the  sunspot  maximum  period,  while  we  use  for  an  estimation  of  the  speed  of  the  deep 

meridional  circulation  the  time  from  shortly  before  the  previous  sunspot  minimum  to  the 

current sunspot maximum. 

6

It is difficult to estimate the speed of this deep circulation, because delay+1 includes not only 

the  transport  from  the  deep  polar  region  to  the  deep  active  latitudes  but  also  the  vertical 

transport  –  sinking  to  the  base  of  the  solar  convective  zone  at  0.7  R  at  high  latitudes  and 

emerging  from  0.7  R  to  the  surface  at  low  latitudes.  Besides,  as  shown  by  Hathaway  et  al. 

(2003), the speed depends on the latitude, decreasing toward the equator. The average speed 

over all this path varies between 3 m/s for strong cycles and 6 m/s for weak cycles which is 

consistent with the estimates for speed about 1 m/s at sunspot maximum latitudes. 

4   Long-term variations  

So far we have been studying the relation of the surface and deep meridional circulation to the 

amplitude of the sunspot cycle. An important feature that is also obvious in Figs.2 and 3, is 

that the velocity of the meridional circulation exhibits century-scale changes. To extend the 

data record back by two more cycles, we use ak-index of geomagnetic activity, analogous to 

aa-index but derived from only one observatory (Helsinki) and highly correlated to aa-index 

in the period when the two overlap (Nevanlinna and Kataja, 1993). The mean annual values 

of ak are available online at (http://www.ava.fmi.fi/MAGN/K-index/ak-aa_index).  

We  define  delay-1  and  delay+1  d  in  the  same  way  as  in  Section  2,  but  expressed  in  years 

between  the  sunspot  maximum  and  the  following  ak-maximum  years,  and  between  the 

sunspot  maximum  and  the  preceding  aa  maximum  years,  respectively.  Figs.4a  and  4b 

demonstrate the long-term variations in delay-1 and delay+1, as proxies for the speed of the 

surface and the deep meridional circulation, respectively, and the maximum sunspot number 

in the solar cycle. Note that the scales of delay-1 and delay+1 are reversed in order to reflect 

the relative changes in velocities rather than times. Again, delay1 is shifted forward by one 

cycle  to  match  the  sunspot  cycle  whose  amplitude  it  determines.  It  is  clearly  seen  that  the 

century-scale variations in the sunspot activity are caused by century-scale variations in the 

solar  meridional  circulation,  with  stronger  cycles  resulting  from  slower  surface  circulation 

and faster deep circulation. 

5     Relative variations of the solar poloidal and toroidal fields 

Feynman (1982) plotted the annual aa-index as a function of the annual sunspot numbers for 

the period 1869-1975 and found that all data points lie above a line – that is, for each level of 

7

 

 

 

solar activity there is some minimum value of geomagnetic activity. This is illustrated in Fig.5 

for  the  period  1844-2005  using  ak-index  as  an  extension  of  aa-index.  The  equation  of  this 

minimum  line  indicates  what  part  of  the  geomagnetic  activity  is  caused  by  sunspot-related 

solar activity or, in other words, by activity related to the solar toroidal field. The solid line 

denoted  by  “F”  in  Fig.5  is  the  one  derived  by  Feynman  (1982)  giving  this  geomagnetic 

activity related to the solar toroidal field: 

aaT(F) = 0.12 * R + 5.38, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

where R stands for the sunspot number. The geomagnetic activity related to the solar poloidal 

field is the residual activity when the sunspot cycle component is removed: 

aaP = aa - aaT  

Later  Ruzmaikin  and  Feynman  (2001),  based  on  data  from  1868  to  2000,  found  another 

relation between aaT and R (the dashed line labeled “RF” in Fig.5): 

Hathaway  and  Wilson  (2006)  used  data  from  1868  to  2005  and  their  fit  (“HW”,  the  dotted 

aaT(RF) = 0.07 * R + 5.17 

 

line in Fig.5) is 

aaT(HW) = 0.097 * R + 10.9   

aaT(GK) = 0.106 * R + 7.02

(4) 

Our fit based on data from 1844 to 2005 is shown by the dash-dotted line denoted “GK”: 

We,  as  in  (Hathaway  and  Wilson,  2006),  have  derived  the  minimum  line  by  finding  the 

minimum aa value in 20 bins in sunspot number (0-10, 10-20, … 190-200), and then finding 

the least square fit through these points.  

As seen from Fig.5, the values of the coefficients in the minimum line depend on the interval 

studied, and these lead to different values of aaT and aaP. All fits except (2) yield much higher 

aaT than aaP which is not realistic (Feynman, 1982), and we attribute it to the derivation of the 

minimum  line.  To  make  the  amplitudes  of  aaT  and  aaP  comparable,  we  calculate  their 

standardized  values  which  give  coinciding  aaT’s  and  very  close  aaP’s from the different fits 

To evaluate the long-term variations in the solar poloidal and toroidal fields, we calculate the 

“climatic norms” - averages over 3 full decades with a step of 10 years (in this case, 1846-

(Fig.6).  

 

8

1875,  1856-1885,  …  1976-2005).  This  type  of  averaging  was  originally  devised  for 

quantifying  climate  change  -  hence  the  name  “climatic  norms”  (Guttman,  1989),  but  has 

proven convenient in many types of long-term processes.  

Fig.6  presents  the  long-term  evolution  of  the  geomagnetic  activity  related  to  solar  poloidal 

field  from  the  different  fits  (the  legend  is  the  same  as  in  Fig.5)  compared  to  the  long-term 

evolution of the geomagnetic activity related to the solar toroidal field (the heavy solid line in 

Fig.6).  It can be seen that before 1890, the solar toroidal field provided the main contribution 

to the geomagnetic activity. After that, the importance of the poloidal field for geomagnetic 

activity  increased  relative  to  the  toroidal  field,  with  the  exception  of  only  three  decades 
around  the  20th century secular solar maximum. In Fig.7a and Fig.7b we compare the long-

term variations of global surface air temperature to the variations in aaT and aaP, respectively. 

The  relation  between  aaT  and  T  is  very  similar  to  the  relation  between  aaT  and  aaP.  Two 
features  are  noteworthy:  the  increased  aaT  in  the  end  of  the  19th  century  and  in  the  interval 

1950-1970  which,  as  in  the  case  with  aaP,  didn’t  lead  to  increased  temperature,  and  the 

decreasing  aaT  after  1970  which,  as  in  the  case  with  aaP,  doesn’t  lead  to  decreasing 

temperature.  On  the  other  hand,  the  long-term  variations  in  global  temperature  are  highly 
correlated (R=0.93 with p<1.10-4) to the long-term variations in the solar poloidal field. Cliver 

et al. (1998) noted that aa-index is a better indicator for the Sun’s role in climate change than 

sunspot  numbers,  and  hypothesized  that  the  increasing  terrestrial  temperature  related  to 

increasing aa-index baseline, can be caused by either a long-term solar irradiance variation, or 

by  a  variation  in  the  solar  wind.  Figs.7a  and  7b  imply  that  more  probable  is  the  latter 

possibility:  solar  irradiance,  like  sunspot  number, is related to the solar poloidal flux, while 

the solar wind is related to the solar poloidal flux.  

An  important  question  is  what  could  be  the  reason  for  the  changing  relative  impact  of  the 

solar toroidal and poloidal fields to geomagnetic activity and to climate. As the solar activity 

consists of transferring the poloidal field into toroidal field which is then transferred back into 

poloidal  field  and  so  on,  we  can  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  ratio  between  the  solar 

poloidal and toroidal field actually changes. What does change is the influence of these fields 

on the Earth. A promising hypothesis for the century-scale change in their relative impact is a 

possible  century-scale  variation  in  the  tilt  angle  of  the  solar  dipole  relative  to  the  solar 

rotational axis. An increased tilt means that the Earth encounters two high speed streams from 

 

9

coronal holes per solar rotation and higher geomagnetic activity (Georgieva and Kirov, 2006). 

However, this question requires additional study and is beyond the scope of the present paper.

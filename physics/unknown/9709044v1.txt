Z3

n-graded Poincar´e superalgebras

Bertrand Le Roy

september 12th, 1997

Abstract

Using colored superanalysis and ε-Lie superalgebras, we build the min-

imal Poincar´e superalgebra in the case of the Z3

n grading. We then build

a representation of this algebra, and the corresponding Poincar´e super-

group.

Introduction

This work is based on generalized Grassmann algebras, which are graded by

an arbitrary abelian group and obey generalized commutation relations. These

relations are based on a commutation factor ε that is a function of the degrees

of the elements it applies to:

ab = ε(da, db)ba

where da and db are the degrees of a and b, which are elements of the grading

group. This commutation factor obeys several very restricting rules.

It is well known that the study of common generalized graded objects, such

as Lie algebras, Grassmann algebras, superspaces, etc., although it has been

widely conducted[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], can be reduced to that of the corresponding

superobjects (Z2-graded), through a change of the commutation factor[3, 8].

But this only means that any theorem that is true for superobjects is also

true for the generalized, arbitrarily graded objects, which is a good thing. We

claim that the commutation factor has physical relevance in itself, and thus that

the generalized objects can describe objects whose properties are diﬀerent from

those of the analogous superobjects. The commutation properties of operators

describing particles are at the origin of some of their most important features,

that is, their bosonic or fermionic statistics. The objects that we will describe

here have some properties of ordinary bosons and fermions, but with additional

features that could be useful in the modelization of quark ﬁelds.

2 Z3

n-graded Grassmann algebra

Among the abelian groups that could be chosen to grade a generalized Grass-

mann algebra, Z3

n groups seem to be very particular in being the only groups to

induce a Grassmann algebra that is maximally symmetric and includes fermionic,

bosonic, and other types of variables[9]. No abelian group composed of more

than three cyclic groups is able to produce a Grassmann algebra that puts them

on an equal footing, and any group composed of less than three cyclic groups

gives an ordinary Grassmann algebra.

We label the three grading groups with the letters r, g and b (for red, green

and blue) for reasons that will become clearer in the sequel. The commutation

factor for the generalized Grassmann algebra is then

ε(x, y) = (

1)xryr+xgyg +xbybqxryg −yrxg+xgyb−yg xb+xbyr−ybxr

−

where the degrees x and y are expressed by three integers representing their

components on the three groups:

x = (xr, xg, xb) and y = (yr, yg, yb)

and q is an nth root of unity.

and ε-commutative algebra.

The generalized Grassmann algebra is deﬁned as a Z3

n-graded, associative

Its generators could be limited to elements of degree 1 in only one of the

three colors, but we choose to include generators of degree (

1,

1,

±

±

±

1), which

3

are fermionic (anticommuting) generators, as can be seen in the commutation

rules below, as well as generators of degree

1 in one of the three colors. We

−

summarize the degrees of the generators in the table below:

Some commutation rules, entirely deﬁned by the commutation factor, are

ηbηa,

¯η ˙a ¯η˙b =

¯η˙b ¯η ˙a,

ηa ¯η˙b =

¯η˙bηa

−

which are the commutation relations of ordinary fermionic variables; other in-

teresting commutation rules include:

θAr θAg = qθAg θAr ,

θAg θAb = qθAbθAg ,

θAb θAr = qθAr θAb

¯θ ¯A¯r

¯θ ¯A¯g = q ¯θ ¯A¯g

¯θ ¯A¯b

= q ¯θ ¯A¯b

¯θ ¯A¯g ,

¯θ ¯A¯b

¯θ ¯A¯r = q ¯θ ¯A¯r

¯θ ¯A¯b

In a sector of a given color, the generators anticommute:

Thus, the colored generators are nilpotent of rank two: θ2

Ar = θ2

Ag = θ2

Ab =

A¯r = θ2

A¯g = θ2
A¯b

generators:

θAr θBr =

θBr θAr

−

θAr ηa =

ηaθAr

−

The most signiﬁcant new feature of this algebra is that it includes a purely

fermionic and bosonic subalgebra, that is an ordinary Grassmann subalgebra,

that contains very particular combinations of the colored generators, especially

if q is not a root of unity, that is, if the grading group is Z3:

The fermionic (anticommuting) elements are:

•

•

– The ηa and ¯η ˙a

tinct colors.

– The products θAr θAg θAb and ¯θ ¯A¯r

¯θ ¯A¯g

¯θ ¯A¯b

of three generators of dis-

– The products of a bosonic element (see below) and a fermionic ele-

ment, or an odd number of the above.

The bosonic elements (commuting with all other elements) are:

– The products θAr

¯θ ¯A¯r , θAg

¯θ ¯A¯g and θAb

¯θ ¯A¯b

of a generator and another

of opposite color.

– The products of an even number of fermionic elements

– The products of bosonic elements.

This list is exhaustive, and one can note that the only possible combinations

of colored variables remind strongly of the observable combinations of quarks

in QCD. This property will have its analogue in the irreducible representations

of the Poincar´e superalgebra. It is well known that a reasonable ﬁeld theory in

a four dimensional minkowskian space-time cannot feature observable particles

5

whose creation and annihilation operators do not obey ordinary commutation

and anticommutation rules[10]. Thus, in a ﬁeld theory based on the objects that

we introduce here, the “colored” particles would be unobservable individually,

but the above combinations into fermions and bosons could be observable. This

could provide an algebraic model for the conﬁnement of quarks. We will develop

this idea further in the next article.

3 Z3

n-graded superspace

The Z3

n-graded superspaces are deﬁned as a set Q and an associated family

of bijections that are homogeneous in degree, the coordinate maps, from Q

to the generalized Grassmann algebra[8].

In the case of ordinary Z2-graded

superspaces, there were only two degrees, and the question of the representation

of all degrees by the coordinates was irrelevant. Here, there can or can not be

coordinates of any possible degree.

One can deﬁne continuity, diﬀerentiation, analytic functions on these super-

spaces, and the usual theorems generalize very well[8]. For example,

∂
∂xi

∂
∂xj

= ε(dxi, dxj )

∂
∂xj

∂
∂xi

where xi and xj are two coordinates, and dxi and dxj are their degrees. The

Leibniz rule generalizes as

∂
∂xi

∂f
∂xi

(f g) =

g + ε(dxi, df )f

∂g
∂xi

if f is a function of homogeneous degree df .

4 Z3

n-graded Poincar´e superalgebras

To generate a Z3

n-graded Poincar´e superalgebra, we will add to the ordinary

Poincar´e algebra a collection of generators of arbitrary degrees to form an ε-Lie

superalgebra[3]. The generalized supercommutator will be noted here as follows

[A, B]c = AB

ε(dA, dB)BA

−

We will focus on the smallest of these algebras that include the usual minimal

Poincar´e superalgebra.

If we add to the Poincar´e algebra the odd generators of a usual Poincar´e

superalgebra, we have to give them a suitable degree in our generalized grading

group. Obviously, the possible degrees are

1 in each color, like in the Grass-

±

mann algebra. The supercommutators of two supertranslations must fall into

the even part of the algebra, that is the Poincar´e algebra. Thus, the non-zero

supercommutation relations of the Poincar´e superalgebra must be reﬂected here

by colored supercommutation relations between generators of opposite degrees

(so that the result is of degree 0). Therefore, the two component and four com-

ponent formulations of Poincar´e superalgebras won’t generalize equivalently.

4.1 Generalized two component formulation

First, we’ll generalize the two component formulation by adding 2 generators

Q1, Q2 of degree 1 in each color (that we’ll call “white” generators) and 2 gener-

ators ¯Q ˙1, ¯Q ˙2 of degree

−

1 in each color (that we’ll call “antiwhite” generators).

7

These generators will give the odd part of the ordinary Poincar´e superalgebra.

Similarly, we’ll add two generators and two “antigenerators” in each color. Fi-

nally, we will not assume anything `a priori on the commutation relations that

don’t give a zero degree result, but we’ll try to keep the algebra as small as

possible. In summary, we have the following generators:

Q1, Q2

¯Q ˙1, ¯Q ˙2 Q1r , Q2r

¯Q ˙1¯r

, ¯Q ˙2¯r

Q1g , Q2g

¯Q ˙1¯g

, ¯Q ˙2¯g

As in the case of Lie superalgebras, the elements of any sector of the alge-

bra of a given degree must form the basis for a representation of the Poincar´e

algebra. We’ll choose our generators here so that the representation for positive

(resp. negative) degree sectors are the left (resp. right) handed irreducible two

component representations of the Lorentz algebra. The translations are trivially

represented. In other words, if α > β, and if d is any degree among (1, 1, 1),

1), r = (1, 0, 0), ¯r = (

1, 0, 0), g, ¯g, b, ¯b, we have, the σ being Pauli

And of course,

[Pµ, Qid]c = [Pµ, ¯Qjd

(2)

If we want the white and anti-white generators to behave like the supertrans-

lations, the commutator of two white —or two antiwhite— generators must be

equal to zero. Similarly, we’ll suppose that the commutator of two generators of

the same color is equal to zero, which will keep the size of the algebra minimal.

Let us ﬁrst compute the commutation relations of two generators of opposite

degrees. The result must be an element of the Poincar´e algebra. The generalized

Jacobi identity[3] and the commutation relations (2) give

[Pµ, [Qid, ¯Qj−d]c]c = 0

Thus, [Qid, ¯Qj−d]c must decompose along the translations Pµ. Another applica-

tion of the Jacobi identity with the rotations, and of the relations (1) give the

coeﬃcients of this decomposition:

[Qid, ¯Qj−d]c = κd

(σµ)idj−d P µ

Xµ=1

In supersymmetry, κd is usually ﬁxed to the value 2, but for the moment, we’ll

allow for diﬀerent values of this parameter for each degree d

(1, 1, 1), r, g, b

.

∈ {

}

It is clear from these relations that the zero degree, the white and the anti-

white generated sectors form a subalgebra that is really a Poincar´e superalgebra

(the colored commutator reduces in these sectors to the supercommutator).

9

We still have to compute the commutation relations of two generators of

diﬀerent and non-opposite degrees. We can reduce the dimension of these bi-

colored sectors as low as 4 while maintaining the Jacobi identities true, by

supposing that each of them is generated by four generators Rαd , where d

is any bicolor degree among r + g, g + b, b + r, b + ¯r, r + ¯g, g + ¯b and

their opposites, and that the following commutation relations hold true:

4.2 Generalized four component formulation

In the generalization of this formulation, we use four generators in each color,

anticolor, as well as in white and antiwhite. The notations are basically the

same as in the two component section, except that the indices run from 1 to 4

instead of from 1 to 2. We choose these generators so that the representation of

the Poincar´e algebra in the colored sectors is a spinorial representation where

the Mαβ are represented by

where the tilda is the transposition operation and the γα are Dirac matrices.

The translations are trivially represented.

Like in the case of the two component formulation, we also introduce sets

of four generators Rαd in the bicolor sectors. The Jacobi identity, and the

5 Representations of the Z3

n-graded Poincar´e su-

peralgebras

The above study of the minimal generalized Poincar´e superalgebra has led us to

algebras where only 21 degrees are present: 0, 1, ¯1, r, g, b, ¯r, ¯g, ¯b, r + g, g + b,

b + r, ¯r + ¯g, ¯g + ¯b, ¯b + ¯r, ¯r + g, ¯g + b, ¯b + r, r + ¯g, g + ¯b, b + ¯r. We have to ﬁnd a

block structure for the representation that reproduces the grading rules. In this

section, we consider only the representation of the four-component Z3

n-graded

Poincar´e superalgebra.

The diagonal blocks must represent transformations of degree 0, that is the

Poincar´e transformations. At least one of these block representations must be

faithful. On the other hand, the commutator of a generator of any color and a

generator of opposite color gives a linear combination of translations. Thus, any

block line or column corresponding to a faithful representation of the Poincar´e

algebra must contain blocks of all colors 1, r, g, b and their opposites. The

smallest structure meeting all requirements is 24

Thus, all elements of a left orthochronous coset of the Poincar´e supergroup

with homogeneous orthochronous Lorentz transformations formed from a given

element [1

X

Ξ

|

|

|

Ω] of the Poincar´e supergroup have the same translational

parts speciﬁed by X, Ξ et Ω. The coset is thus entirely deﬁned by X, Ξ and Ω.

In other words, the action of the transformation [Λ

T

U] on the coset de-

ζ

|

|

|

ﬁned by X, Ξ and Ω results in the coset deﬁned by ΛX + T + τ , Γspin(Λ)Ξ + ζ

and ΛΩ + U + ρ.

Thus, we deﬁne the action of the generalized Poincar´e supergroup on a point

of the superspace deﬁned by the coordinates X, Ξ and Ω as its action on the

coset deﬁned by the same coordinates. The dimensions of the superspace are

given by:

D = (40, 41, 4¯1, 4r, 4g, 4b, 4¯r, 4¯g, 4¯b,

4r+g, 4g+b, 4b+r, 4¯r+¯g, 4¯g+¯b, 4¯b+¯r, 4¯r+g, 4¯g+b, 4¯b+r, 4r+¯g, 4g+¯b, 4b+¯r)

An element [Λ

T

ζ

U] of the Poincar´e supergroup transforms the point

|
(X, Ξ, Ω) into the point (X′, Ξ′, Ω′), where

|

|

X′ = ΛX + T + τ

Ξ′ = Γspin(Λ)Ξ + ζ

Ω′ = ΛΩ + U + ρ

We’ll also note (X′, Ξ′, Ω′) = [Λ

T

U](X, Ξ, Ω).

ζ

|

|

|

Of course, the consecutive action of two transformations on a point is equiv-

alent to the action of the product of the transformations.

This rule includes the following particular cases. If we apply a homogeneous

25

Lorentz transformation [Λ

If we apply a translation [1

Ω′ = ΛΩ

X′ = X + T

Ξ′ = Ξ

Ω′ = Ω

X′ = X

Ξ′ = Ξ

Ω′ = Ω + U

26

If we apply a colored supertranslation [1

Ω′ = Ω + ρ

Finally, if we apply [1

We’ll call scalar superﬁeld an analytic operator-valued function Φs(X, Ξ, Ω)

on the superspace.

The transformation operators P ([Λ

We have constructed here a generalized Poincar´e superalgebra and the corre-

sponding supergroup based on the larger grading group Z3

n, as well as its ac-

tion on the corresponding superspace. Even though these constructions can be

brought back to ordinary superstructures through a change of the commutation

27

factor, some properties appear clearly only with the original commutation fac-

tor, which has some relevance in itself. This will be shown in more details in the

next article, where we will describe the particle contents of the theory (especially

their spin and statistics) through the study of the irreducible representations of

the Poincar´e superalgebra that has been developed here.

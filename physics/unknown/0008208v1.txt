Abstract

For  many  next-generation  high 

intensity  proton
accelerator  applications  including  the  Spallation  Neutron
Source  (SNS),  superconducting  (SC)  RF  provides  the
technology  of  choice  for  the  linac.  In  designing  the
superconducting  cavity,  several  features,  such  as  peak
fields,  inter-cell  coupling,  mechanical  stiffness,  field
flatness,  external  Q,  manufacturability,  shunt  impedance,
higher  order  mode  (HOM),  etc.,  should  be  considered
together. A systematic approach to determine the optimum
cavity  shape  by  exploring  the  entire  geometric  space  of
the  cavity  has  been  found.  The  most  efficient  use  of  RF
energy can be accomplished by adjusting the cell shape. A
small  region  in  parameter  space  satisfying  all  reasonable
design criteria has been found. With this design procedure,
choosing  the  optimum  shape  is  simplified.  In  this  paper,
the whole design procedure of this optimisation scheme is
explained and applied to the SNS cavity design.

1  INTRODUCTION

In many recently initiated or proposed projects for high
intensity  proton  acceleration,  SCRF  technology  has  been
selected  for  the  main  part  of  the  linac,  which  uses
elliptical  shape  SC  cavities.  SNS  will  be  the  first  high
intensity  proton  accelerator  with  a  SC  linac.  The  basic
parameters of the SNS SC linac are shown in Table 1.

   In  designing  the  cavity,  RF  and  mechanical  properties
are  considered  together,  especially  for  the  cavity  whose
beta is less than one. The general design bases and issues
for  the  SNS  cavity  are  summarized  in  terms  of  cavity
parameters.

For the inner cell design;
•  Minimise the peak surface fields
•  Provide a reasonable mechanical stiffness
•  Maximize the R/Q
•  Achieve a reasonable inter-cell coupling coefficient
For the end cell and full cavity design;
•  Obtain a good field flatness

•  Obtain  a  lower  (or  same)  surface  fields  at  end  cells

than (or with) those of inner cell

•  Achieve a reasonable external Q, Qex

All  the  issues  listed  above  are  directly  linked  to  the
shape,  and  the  effects  of  shape  on  these  issues  are
different.  In  some  aspects,  the  effects  compete,  and
optimization  among  tradeoffs  becomes  necessary.  A
systematic  scheme  is  introduced  here  for  choosing  the
optimum cavity shape.

2  INNER-CELL DESIGN

Figure  1  shows  the  geometric  parameters  of  the
elliptical  cell.  Adjusting  four  of  these  five  parameters
(Req, α, Rc, a/b, Ri) determines a cell shape that satisfies
required beta and frequency. Usually the equator radius is
used  for  tuning,  since  its  effect  on  the  resonance
frequencies  is  large  and  its  influence  on  the  other  cavity
parameters is negligible.

Figure 1: Geometric parameters of the cell.

In order to understand the influences of cell parameters
on the cavity performance, the entire geometric space was
explored. The following procedures were established from
this  understanding.  Peak  fields  (Ep  &  Bp),  inter-cell
coupling coefficient (k), R/Q, and Lorentz force detuning
coefficient  (K)  are  used  as  cavity  parameters.  The  first
step is to determine relations between the dome radius and
the  iris  ellipse  aspect  ratio  at  fixed  iris  radius  and  slope
angle.  At  any  dome  radius,  the  surface  electric  field
profile can be changed by adjusting a/b. In this adjustment
variations  of  other  cavity  parameters  are  negligible.
Figures 2  (a)  and  (b)  are  comparisons  of  surface  electric
fields  for  given  a  peak  surface  electric  field  and
accelerating field, respectively. The line 2 in Figure 2 (a)
has higher accelerating field than the others. The line 2 in
Figure 2 (b) has lower peak electric field than the others.
The field profile of line 2 provides the efficient use of RF
energy.

Figure  2:  Surface  electric  fields  of  cells  with  different
values of a/b; (a) at same peak surface electric field, (b) at
same acceleration gradient.

The best values of a/b are automatically determined by
fixing  the  other  geometric  cell  parameters.  In  this
procedure, a/b’s are found as a function of Rc’s at given
Ri and α. Slope angles above 6 degree are required for the
rinsing process. Due to its small cell length, only a small
angle  region  from  6  to  8  degrees  leads  to  a  good  cell
performance  for  the  medium  beta  case.  Finally  the  cell
geometry  can  be  defined  with  the  remaining  two  cell
parameters, Ri and Rc, at fixed slope angle.

Figure  3:  “Efficient-set”  lines  of  cell  geometry  for  SNS
b=0.61 cavity at the slope angle of 7 degree.

Figure 3 is an example of SNS medium beta (β=0.61)
inner  cell  at  the  slope  angle  of  7  degrees.  SUPERFISH
was  used  for  the  analysis  [1].  These  lines  all  satisfy  the
condition  of  a  flat  field  around  the  iris.  In  Figure  4,
relative values of cavity parameters are plotted for the cell
geometry  on  the  solid  line  in  Figure  3.  The  cell  with
efficient-set  having  Rc=30  mm  is  used  as  normalisation
reference.  The  Lorentz  force  detuning  coefficient  K  is
calculated  with  fixed  boundary  condition  and  stiffener
location of 70 mm from the cavity axis. This coefficient is
sensitive to the shape of the iris ellipse, especially in low
beta case. Similar graphs can be done for other Ri values
to cover all the geometric parameter space.

An  optimum  cell  shape  that  satisfies  all  the  design
criteria  can  be  found  by  combining  the  results  from
different Ri’s.

Figure 5 is an example of SNS medium beta  cavity  at
the slope angle of 7 degree. The SNS design criteria are;
Ep=27.5 MV/m, Bp<60 mT, k>1.5 %, K<3 Hz/(MV/m)2,
and Eo>11.9 MV/m for the reference geometry.

represented by dome radius, Rc.

The Eo value used here pertains to the inner-cell only.
All the design criteria are marked with bold lines in Figure
5. There is a small region where all the design criteria are
satisfied.  Selecting  the  final  cell  geometry  is  a  matter  of
the  strategy.  SNS  chose  the  cell  geometry  for  the  high
accelerating gradient within the design criteria.

 The results of inner cell design for the high beta cavity
show  similar  behaviours  except  a  few  aspects.  The
Lorentz  force  detuning  is  not  sensitive  to  cell  shape,  so
this is not an issue in the high beta cavity. The slope angle
can be chosen from  6  to  12  degrees,  for  specified  cavity
parameters.  The  larger  slope  angle  is  better  for  end  cell
tuning.

 3  END CELL DESIGN

 End-cells should be tuned separately due to the attached
beam pipes. Changing the shape of end-cells must lead to
a  reasonable  axial  electrical  field  flatness  below  ~2  %.
Peak surface fields must be equal or lower than inner cells
value.  Many  different  end-cell  shapes  can  satisfy  these
criteria. The Figure 6 shows the axial electric field profile
for different acceptable cavity geometries.

 Each  end-cell  designs  necessitate  a  different  approach
because one is connected to the power coupler. A coaxial
type power coupler will be used in SNS.

Required  Qex’s  are  7.3×105  and  7.0×105  for  medium
and high beta cavities, respectively. A computer study of
Qex has been done following a scheme introduced in [2].
Four-parameter  space  has  been  explored  (Figure  7).  The
geometry of the power coupler is not used as a parameter
in the study.

The inner conductor tip position has a strong effect on
the coupling between the cavity and the power coupler. As
shown  in  Figure  8,  about  25  mm  displacement  results  in
one order variation on the Qex value.

Figure  8:  Variations  of  Qex’s  as  a  function  of  ITP  for
three different cavities. Same GOC and 7 cm of LPC are
used for each calculation.

Since keeping the same iris radius as the inner cell leads
to  a  high  Qex  value,  enlarging  the  beam  pipe  size  can
provide a solution. This option is efficient below a certain
diameter. Figure 9 shows that over 62 mm, increasing the
beam pipe size has a weak influence on the high beta case.
The points marked with triangle are not on the line. This
results  from  the  change  in  field  profile  after  end  cell

tuning.  These  points  still  satisfy  all  requirements,  that
means the Qex can be also controlled by changing end cell
shape only.

The  effect  of  LPC  is  also  examined  from  8.5  cm  to  7
cm,  the  lowest  possible  distance.  The  Qex  decreases
linearly by a factor of three.

Many  end  cell  shapes  could  satisfy  the  requirements.
The  final  decision  will  depend  on  the  amount  of
engineering margin.

4  HIGHER ORDER MODE (HOM)

HOM  analysis  for  the  reference  geometry  has  been
done.  Many  trapped  modes  are  found  even  in  reference
geometry.  Beam  dynamics  issues  related  with  HOM  are
under  study  and  the  intermediate  results  suggest  that  the
cumulative beam break-up is not an issue in SNS  [3].  In
order to investigate the effects of mechanical imperfection
of the cavity on the trapped modes, Monte-Carlo analysis
is in progress.

 5  SUMMARY

The  cavity  performance  is  visualised  in  the  geometric

parameter space by the systematic scheme introduced.

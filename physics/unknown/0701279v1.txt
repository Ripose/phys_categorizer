Abstract
We investigate  the  fully developed flow between two parallel plates and 
the  film  flow  over  a  plate  in  an  electrically  conducting  fluid  under  the 
action  of  a  parallel  Lorentz  force.  Exact  analytical  solutions  are  derived 
for  velocity,  flow  rate  and  wall  shear  stress  at  the  plates.  The  velocity 
results are presented in figures. All these flows are new and are presented 
for the first time in the literature.

INTRODUCTION
    In  1961  Gailitis  and  Lielausis  introduced  the  idea  of  using  a  Lorentz 
force  to  control  the  flow  of  an  electrically  conducting  fluid  over  a  flat 
plate. This is achieved by applying an external electromagnetic field (see 
figure  1)  by  a  stripwise  arrangement  of  flush  mounted  electrodes  and 
permanent magnets of alternating polarity and magnetization. The Lorentz 
force, which acts parallel to the plate, can either assist or oppose  the flow.  
This  idea  was    later abandoned  and only  recently attracted  new  attention 
(Henoch  and  Stace, 1995,  Crawford and  Karniadakis, 1997,  Berger et al. 
2000).  In addition, in  last years much investigation on flow control using 
the Lorentz force is being conducted at the Rossendorf Institute and at  the 
Institute for Aerospace Engineering  in Dresden, Germany (Posdziech and 
Grundmann, 2001, Weier and Gerbeth, 2004, Weier, 2005, Mutschke et al. 
2006, Albrecht and Grundmann, 2006).
    Although 
  in  many  flow 
configurations,  some simple  flows  under  the  influence  of  this  force  have 
not  been  investigated  until  now.  In  the  present  paper  we  will  investigate 
the classical flow between two parallel, infinite plates and the problem of 
a film flowing over a plate.           

the  Lorentz  force  has  been  applied 

THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL 

Consider  the flow between two horizontal, infinite, parallel plates  with u
and  v  denoting  respectively  the  velocity  components  in  the  x  and  y
direction, where x is the coordinate along the plates and y is the coordinate 
perpendicular to x. It is assumed that an electromagnetic field exists at the 
lower  plate  and  therefore  a  Lorentz  force,  parallel  to  the  plates, 
is 
produced.  The  fluid  is  forced  to  move  due  to  the  action  of  the  Lorentz 
force.    For  steady,  two-dimensional  flow  the  boundary  layer  equations 
with  constant  fluid  properties  are  (Tsinober  and  Shtern,  1967,  Weier, 
2005)

where p is the pressure, ν is the fluid  kinematic  viscosity,   j0 (A/m2)  is 
the  applied  current  density  in  the  electrodes,  M0
(Tesla)  is  the 
magnetization  of  the  permanent  magnets,  a is  the  width  of  magnets  and 
electrodes  and  ρ  is  the  fluid  density.  The  last  term  in  the  momentum 
equation is the Lorentz force which  decreases exponentially with  y and is 
independent  of  the  flow.  For  fully  developed  conditions  the  flow  is 
parallel, the transverse velocity is zero, and  the flow is described only by 
the following  momentum equation

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
  

1. The classical Couette flow with Lorentz force

The first viscous fluid flow treated in the classical book by White (2006) 
is the steady flow between a fixed and a moving plate (Couette flow) and 
this happens in almost all Fluid Mechanics books because this flow is the 
simplest in Fluid Mechanics (Liggett, 1994, page 156, Kleinstreuer, 1997, 
page  121,  Panton,  2005,  page  132).  This  flow  is  called  Couette  flow  in 
honour  of  the  French  M.  Couette  (1890)  who  performed  experiments  on 
the flow between a fixed and moving concentric cylinder. The  boundary 
conditions  for this case are:

at y = 0:    u = 0                                                                                          (4)
as y=h:    u =u2                                                                                                                                          (5)                     

where  h  is  the  distance  between  the  plates  and  u2  is  the  velocity  of  the 
upper plate. 
    Here  we  will  investigate  this  flow  under  the  action  of  a  Lorentz  force 
produced  at  the  lower  plate.  The  momentum  equation  (3),  without  the 
pressure  gradient,    with  boundary  conditions  (4)-(5)  has  the  following 
exact analytical solution

The first term on the right is due to the motion of the upper plate (classical

Couette flow) and the second term due to the action of the Lorentz force.

where  μ  is  the  fluid  dynamic  viscosity.  The  Lorentz  number  is 
dimensionless  and  expresses  the  balance  between  the  electromagnetic 
forces  to  viscous  forces.  This  number  is  used  in  the  analysis  of  the 
boundary layer flow over a flat plate situated in a free stream and there as 
characteristic velocity is used the free stream velocity (Weier, 2005). We 
see that this number appears also in the Couette  flow with characteristic 
velocity  that  of  the  moving  plate.  The  dimensionless  velocity  given  by 
equation  (6)  depends  both  on  Lorentz  number  Z  and  the  ratio  h/a.  The 
above  combination  of  the      classical  Couette  flow  with  Lorentz  forces  is 
presented  here  for  the  first  time  in  the  literature  and  may  be  called 
Couette-Pantokratoras  flow.
    The dimensionless flow rate M between the plates is 

and is obtained by integrating the velocity function. Thus we have

In figure 2 some velocity profiles are presented for different values of the 
Lorentz number and h/a=1.  The profile 1 corresponds to zero  shear stress 
at  the  lower  plate  and  this  happens  when    Z=-0.4577064.  The  profile  3
corresponds to zero  shear stress at the upper  plate and this happens when  
Z=1.2179889. The profile 2 corresponds to Couette flow.
    When the lower  plate, where the electromagnetic  field is produced,   is 
moving  and  the  upper  plate  is  motionless  the  velocity  is  given  by  the 
following equation

Z=0.4577064. The profile 2 corresponds to Couette flow.

2. The classical Poiseuille flow with   Lorentz forces

Another  kind  of  flow  between  parallel  plates  is  the    Poiseuille  flow 
(Poiseuille, 1840)  which  is caused by a constant pressure gradient along 
the  plates  while  the  plates  are  motionless.  This  flow  is  also  included  in   
Fluid Mechanics books (Liggett, 1994, page 157,  Panton, 2005, page 125, 
White, 2006, page 106).  The boundary conditions are 

at y = 0:    u = 0                                                                                        (20)
as y=h:    u =0                                                                                                                                         (21)                     

The analytical solution of equation (3) with boundary conditions (20)-(21) 
is

The  first  term  on  the  right  is  due  to  the  pressure  gradient  (classical 
Poiseuille  flow)    and  the  second  term  due  to  the  action  of  the  Lorentz 
force. In the above equation there are two characteristic velocities, the first 
one  due  to  pressure  gradient  and  the  second  due  to  Lorentz  forces  as 
follows

In figure 4 we present some velocity profiles for h/a=1 and different Pap
values.  The profile 1 corresponds to zero  shear stress at the lower plate 
and this happens when  Pap=-2.1848066. The profile 3 corresponds to zero  
shear  stress  at  the  upper    plate  and  this  happens  when    Pap=-0.8210255. 
The profile 4 corresponds to zero pressure gradient. The profiles 1, 2 and 
3 are S-shaped and each of them has an inflection point. 

3. Flow between parallel plates due to  Lorentz force only

If both  plates  are motionless and  the  pressure  gradient  is zero  we have  a 
flow  caused  by  the  Lorentz  force  only.  From  equation  (22)  we  get  the 
velocity of this flow by putting the pressure gradient  zero. Thus we have

In  figure  5  velocity  profiles  are  shown  for  different  values  of  h/a.    This 
flow  has  some  special  characteristics.  When  h/a →∞  the  maximum 
dimensionless  velocity    tends  to  1  and  the  velocity  profile  tends  to 
compose  from  two    straight  lines,  one  of  them  horizontal  and  the  other 
with  inclination  equal  to  45  degrees.    When  h/a →0  the    dimensionless 
velocity  tends  to  0  and  the  velocity  profile  tends  to  become    symmetric 
with  its  maximum  at  the  centerline  between  the  plates.  We  see  also  that 
the velocity maximum moves to the centerline as  h/a decreases. 

4. Film flow due to   Lorentz forces 

Another  kind  of  simple  parallel  flow  is  that  of  a    film  falling  down  an 
inclined  wall  due  to  gravity  and    due  to  the  action  of    a  constant  shear 
stress  on  the  free  surface  (Bird  et  al.  2002,  page  45,  Panton,  2005,  page 
135). Here we will treat the motion of a film due to Lorentz force ignoring 
gravity and retaining the action of the surface shear stress. The  boundary 
conditions  for this case are:

at y = 0:    u = 0                                                                                        (40)

In figure 6 velocity profiles are shown for different values of Paf number 
and  h/a=1.    The  curve  1  corresponds  to  zero  wall  shear  stress  and  this 
happens when Paf=-3.0058321 while curve 2 corresponds to zero surface 
shear  stress  (Paf=0),  that  is,  the  flow  is  produced  by  the  Lorentz  force 
only. 

5. Film flow due to   Lorentz force only 

If the shear stress at the surface is zero we have a film  flow caused by the 
Lorentz force only.  From equation (45) we get the velocity of this flow by 
putting Paf=0. Thus we have

In  figure  7  velocity  profiles  are  shown  for  different  values  of  h/a.  All 
velocity  profiles  have  zero  gradient  at  the  surface  and  meet  the  surface 
vertically.      When  h/a →∞  the  maximum  dimensionless  velocity,  which

lies  on  the  free  surface,      tends  to  1  and  the  velocity  profile  tends  to 
compose  from  two    straight  lines,  one  of  them  horizontal  and  the  other  
vertical.  When h/a →0 the  dimensionless velocity tends to 0.

CONCLUSIONS

In  this  paper  some  new  kinds  of  parallel  flows  have  been  presented  and 
analyzed for electrically conducting fluids. Exact analytical solutions have 
been  given  for  velocity,  flow  rate  and  wall  shear  stresses.  The  author 
believes that the results of the present work  will  enrich the list with the 
existing  exact solutions  of the Navier-Stokes equations  and  may help the 
investigation of flow of electrically conducting fluids like water and liquid 
metals.

Broadband noise on supercontinuum spectra generated in microstructure fiber is shown to 

lead to amplitude fluctuations as large as 50% for certain input laser pulse parameters. 

We study this noise using both experimental measurements and numerical simulations 

with a generalized stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation, finding good quantitative 

agreement over a range of input pulse energies and chirp values.  This noise is shown to 

arise from nonlinear amplification of two quantum noise inputs: the input pulse shot 

noise and the spontaneous Raman scattering down the fiber.

The generation of broadband supercontinuum spectra from the injection of femtosecond 

pulses into microstructure or tapered fibers has now been achieved by several groups[1, 

2].  The supercontinuum is a remarkable light source, exhibiting both spatial and phase 

coherence,  while  simultaneously  spanning  the  entire  visible  spectrum  with  brightness 

exceeding that of a light bulb by at least 5 orders of magnitude.  These unique properties 

should  make  the  supercontinuum  an  ideal  tool  for  important  applications  including 

optical coherence  tomography [3] and spectroscopy [4, 5].  Indeed, it has already led a 

revolution  in  frequency  metrology,  allowing  the  creation  of  optical  atomic  clocks  with 

stability that exceeds the performance of the world’s best microwave-based atomic clocks 

[6,  7].    However,  a  significant  broadband  amplitude  noise  on  the  supercontinuum  has 

been observed to limit its stability, interfering with optical clocks [8, 9] and rendering the 

supercontinuum  too  noisy  for  many  applications.    This  noise  extends  well  beyond  the 

frequency  roll-off  of  any  laser  technical  noise  [10],  and,  depending  on  the  input  pulse 

parameters,  can  lead  to  50  %  temporal  intensity  fluctuations.    While  in  some  cases, 

empirical  steps  have  been  taken  to  reduce  this  noise,  it  is  clear  that  a  more  complete 

understanding  of  its  physical  origin  and  scaling  properties  is  essential  if  the 

supercontinuum is to be exploited to its full potential. 

In  this  Letter,  we  show  that  the  origin  of  this  broadband  noise  is  the  nonlinear 

amplification  of  quantum  fluctuations,  both  in  the  input  laser  light  and  in  the  Raman 

scattering  process  within  the  fiber.    While  this  noise  cannot  be  eliminated  due  to  its 

fundamental  origins,  we  identify  methods  of  reducing  its  amplification  through  a 

Corwin et al.

judicious  choice  of  input  pulse  parameters.    As  well  as  their  relevance  to  frequency 

metrology experiments, these results also represent a significant advance in the modeling 

of  supercontinuum  generation,  as  we  present  the  first  quantitative  comparison  between 

the measured noise on the supercontinuum and that predicted from stochastic numerical 

simulations.   

 

Supercontinuum  generation  in  bulk  media,  and  in  more  conventional  optical 

fibers, has been successfully described by the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation 

(NLSE)  [11].  Recently,  the  generalized  NLSE  has  proven  similarly  successful  in 

describing  supercontinuum  generated  in  microstructure  fiber  [12-15].  However,  the 

NLSE is insufficient to describe the broadband amplitude noise; a stochastic NLSE [16]  

must be employed.  Here, we have performed a quantitative study of the supercontinuum 

noise by using a stochastic NLSE model which rigorously includes quantum-limited shot 

noise  on  the  injected  input  field  as  well  as  spontaneous  Raman  fluctuations  via  a 

stochastic Langevin source term [16].  Surprisingly, these small noise seeds are amplified 

into very large intensity fluctuations due to the inherent nonlinear processes involved in 

the supercontinuum generation.  This noise amplification is closely related to earlier work 

on continuum generation in more conventional optical fibers, where a similar increase in 

amplitude noise was observed.  This noise was attributed to modulation instability (MI) 

on  the  pulse  envelope  induced  by  amplified  spontaneous  emission  (ASE)  from  the 

amplified input laser pulse [17, 18].

The overall noise  spectrum  of  the supercontinuum from the microstructure fiber 

will  be  comprised  of  both  broadband  amplitude  noise  and  a  low-frequency  component 

resulting  from  the  laser  technical  noise.    Experimental  and  numerical  studies  show  the 

supercontinuum  spectral  and  coherence  properties  to  depend  sensitively  on  initial  input 

conditions [15, 19, 20],  indicating that any technical noise on the laser will also result in 

large  amplitude  fluctuations  across  the  supercontinuum.    This  low-frequency  technical 

noise,  which  arises  from  laser  power  fluctuations  or  beam  pointing  stability,  can  be 

mitigated by the proper choice of experimental parameters, for example a quieter pump 

laser.  In contrast, the broadband noise resulting from the input shot noise is fundamental 

to the supercontinuum generation process since the input shot noise and the spontaneous 

Raman scattering are quantum noise sources. 

 

Figure  1  shows 

the  experimental  setup. 

  An  Ar+ 

laser-pumped  femtosecond 

titanium:sapphire laser provides pulses with a typical bandwidth of ~45 nm full width at 

half  maximum  (FWHM)  centered  at  810  nm  at  a  100  MHz  repetition  rate.    A  double-

passed  fused-silica  prism  pair  introduces  a  linear  chirp  on  the  laser  pulses,  and 

interferometric  autocorrelation  measurements  are  used  to  infer  both  the  input-pulse 

duration  and  chirp  magnitude  (in  fs2),  assuming  a  sech2  pulse  intensity  envelope.    The 

chirped  pulses  with  typical  energies  of  0.9  nJ  are  injected  into  a  15  cm  long 

microstructure fiber with zero group-velocity-dispersion at 770 nm [1], and the output is 

characterized using an optical spectrum analyzer and an apparatus dedicated to measuring 

the  relative  intensity  noise  (RIN).    Here,  the  supercontinuum  is  attenuated  to  prevent 

detector  saturation,  spectrally  filtered  by  a  monochromator  with  8  nm  bandwidth,  and 

Corwin et al.

directed to either an infrared or visible detector.  The resulting electrical signal is fed into 

an electrical spectrum analyzer, where the RF noise power above the detector noise floor 

is measured.  The RIN in dBc/Hz is obtained from this noise power, divided by the RF 

electrical bandwidth and the total detected power, and is measured at 10 nm increments 

across the supercontinuum.  To avoid contributions from laser technical noise, the noise 

power  is  measured  at  Fourier  frequencies  of  3  MHz  and  above,  where  the 

titanium:sapphire laser is approximately shot-noise limited [10]. 

The experimentally measured spectral width and the noise are shown in Fig. 2 as the solid 

lines.  As  noted  by  other  groups,  we  see  complicated  spectral  structure  on  the 

supercontinuum  [12-15,  19].    The  RIN  measurements  also  reveal  for  the  first  time  the 

dramatic and complicated wavelength-dependent structure of the supercontinuum noise, 

where fluctuations as high as 20 dB are common.    Under a wide variety of input pulse 

conditions,  the  resulting  supercontinua  exhibit  a  consistent  dip  in  the  RIN  at  the  input 

laser wavelengths (λL~810 nm) and also across the Raman soliton on the infrared side of 

the  spectrum  (λR~1300  nm).    Otherwise,  there  is  no  universal  correlation  between  the 

RIN and the optical spectrum.  Figure 3 shows the experimental dependence of RIN on 

Fourier  frequency  for  representative  wavelengths  of  a  typical  data  set.    While  the  RIN 

varies  greatly  with  wavelength,  it  is  clearly  white  noise,  i.e.  independent  of  Fourier 

 

 

The numerical simulations which model these measurements are based on the generalized 

frequency [21].

Here  E(z,t)  is  the  complex  pulse  envelope  in  a  co-moving  frame,  the  βk’s  describe  the 

fiber  dispersion  [1]  and  the  nonlinear  coefficient  γ  =  100  W-1 km-1  at  810 nm.    The 

response  function  R(t)  =  (1-fR)δ(t)  +  fR  hR(t)  includes  both  instantaneous  and  delayed 

Raman contributions with the fractional Raman contribution fR = 0.18.  For hR, we used 

the  measured  Raman  response  of  silica.  Spontaneous  Raman  noise  appears  as  the 

multiplicative  stochastic  variable  ΓR,  which  has  frequency  domain  correlations

the  thermal  Bose  distribution  nth(Ω)  =  [exp(ħΩ/kBT)-1]-1  and  U  is  the  Heaviside  step 

function.    The  input  pulse  initial  conditions  are  those  of  the  experimentally  measured 

pulse duration and chirp, with the addition of quantum-limited shot noise.  We stress that 

the  magnitude  of  the  quantum  noise  terms  on  the  input  pulse  and  due  to  spontaneous 

Raman  scattering  have  no  adjustable  parameters.    The  RIN  is  obtained  from  the 

simulations by Fourier analysis of numerically generated supercontinuum obtained over 

an ensemble of typically 128 simulations with different initial random noise, assuming a 

100 MHz repetition rate as in the experiment.   

 

The  dashed  lines  of  Fig.  2  show  numerical  results  for  one  set  of  simulations.    Good 

qualitative  agreement  is  observed  between  the  experimental  and  simulated  spectra  and 

RIN. The size of the fluctuations in RIN with wavelength, the average level of the RIN, 

and most features are reproduced in the simulations.  In particular, the decrease in RIN 

Corwin et al.

around the input laser and Raman soliton wavelengths (λL and λS, respectively) appears 

both in the experiment and theory.   

 

 

The supercontinuum spectrum and noise level depend strongly on the input parameters of 

the laser pulse and many sets of data similar to those presented in Fig. 2 were taken under 

a  variety  of  input  conditions.    The  RIN  always  exhibits  the  complicated  wavelength 

dependence shown in Fig. 2, but it is inconvenient to compare many such curves directly.  

Therefore, in subsequent figures only the median RIN value is given, calculated across all 

wavelengths  for  which  there  is  sufficient  optical  power.    The  resulting  median  RIN 

indicates the overall RIN of the data set, but it should be remembered that the deviations 

from  this  median  value  with  wavelength  are  substantial.    In  fact,  the  statistics  of  these 

deviations  are  roughly  consistent  with  Gaussian  optical  intensity  fluctuations  with  unit 

fractional  standard  deviation.    Because  of  averaging  effects,  both  the  experimentally 

measured  and  simulated  RIN  depend  on  the  spectral  bandwidth  of  the  monochromator.  

For  both,  in  these  results  the  spectral  bandwidth  was  8  nm.    Reducing  the  spectral 

bandwidth to 1 nm increases the median RIN by ~ 3dB.   

Both the spectral width and the RIN increase with input pulse energy, as shown in Fig. 4 

for  a  moderately  chirped  input  pulse.  The  values  measured  experimentally  (triangles, 

solid  line)  are  reproduced  well  in  the  simulation  results  (circles,  dashed  line).  

Significantly, the spectral width increases with injected pulse energy at the expense of a 

corresponding increase in the noise.  In fact, the linear increase in the RIN (in dBc/Hz) 

translates  to  an  exponential  increase  in  the  associated  fractional  intensity  fluctuations 

Corwin et al. 

Page 8

with  injected  energy.    Indeed,  at  the  largest  spectral  width  of  ~600  nm,  the  relatively 

small RIN of -100 dBc/Hz corresponds to pulse-to-pulse fluctuations of ~7 %.   

 

Although the results  above appear to suggest that the broadest supercontinuum spectral 

widths are necessarily associated with the largest RIN, additional experiments show that 

precise  control  of  the  input  pulse  chirp  permits  the  generation  of  octave-spanning 

supercontinua with near detection shot-noise limited RIN.  Figure 5 shows experimental 

measurements  (triangles)  and  numerical  simulations  (circles)  of  the  supercontinuum 

spectral width and the median RIN as a function of input chirp over the range –500fs2 to 

+600 fs2[22].  As expected, large supercontinuum spectral widths are observed with the 

shortest (near transform-limited) input pulses, because shorter pulse duration at constant 

pulse energy implies higher peak power and thus enhanced nonlinear spectral broadening.  

In  contrast,  the  median  RIN,  which  depends  strongly  and  asymmetrically  on  the  pulse 

chirp, is smallest  at the shortest pulse  durations.  At large negative chirps of ~-400 fs2, 

corresponding  to  pulse  widths  of  ~60  fs,  the  RIN  values  can  reach  –83  dBc/Hz, 

corresponding to 50 % fluctuations in the pulse-to-pulse amplitude. However, for pulses 

that are near transform-limited or with a small positive chirp (<+200 fs2), RIN values are 

only  -130  dBc/Hz,  which  is  just  above  the  detection  shot-noise  limit  for  our  apparatus.  

Again,  the  measured  dependence  of  RIN  on  chirp  agrees  well  with  the  results  of  the 

simulation.    Some  scatter  is  observed  in  the  data,  especially  for  large  positive  and 

negative values of chirp.  This is attributed in part to uncertainty in the pulse chirp and 

energy.    These  data  are  taken  with  a  laser  spectral  width  of  45  nm;  data  taken  at  input 

spectral widths of 27 nm and 55 nm show similar dependencies.   

Corwin et al.

While  the  noise  above  results  from  both  input  noise  seeds,  simulations  show  that  the 

input  shot  noise  is  the  dominant  noise  seed,  and  that  Raman  scattering  plays  only  a 

relatively  minor  role.    When  only  Raman  scattering  noise  is  included  numerically,  the 

RIN is reduced by 20 dB; when only shot noise is included, the RIN is reduced by only 3 

dB.  It is surprising that for an input shot noise of –172 dBc/Hz, the noise at the output 

can be as large as –80 dBc/Hz, corresponding to a nonlinear amplification of ~90 dB.  In 

fact,  there  is  a  strong  link  between  this  nonlinear  amplification  and  the  initial  spectral 

broadening, as shown in Fig. 6, where the simulated evolution of the spectral width and 

RIN  is  plotted  as  a  function  of  propagation  distance.    The  majority  of  the  spectral 

broadening occurs in the first ~1 cm of propagation, which is also the distance scale on 

which the input shot noise is most strongly amplified.  The strong dependence of the final 

RIN on the pulse chirp observed in Fig. 5 can also be understood in the context of Fig. 6.  

For short transform-limited pulses or pulses with a small positive chirp, which undergo 

initial  compression,  the  spectral  broadening  is  more  rapid  than  for  pulses  with  a  large 

negative chirp.  The more rapidly the spectrum broadens, the more rapidly the pulse will 

spread  temporally  through  fiber  dispersion,  leading  to  a  reduced  overall  noise 

amplification (akin to modulation instability gain), and therefore a reduced overall RIN.   

In  conclusion,  we  have  experimentally  characterized 

the  broadband  noise  on 

supercontinua  in  microstructure  fiber.    Numerical  simulations  using  the  stochastic 

generalized  NLSE  show  that  this  broadband  noise  results  from  the  very  basic  noise 

processes of amplified input shot noise and Raman scattering.  Thus, the supercontinuum 

Corwin et al. 

Page 10

output  can  exhibit  excess  noise  approaching  50  %  amplitude  fluctuations  that  arise 

directly from the shot noise on the input laser pulse.  While the noise grows exponentially 

with input power, it is at a minimum for the shortest input pulse duration, which is the 

same  condition  that  yields  the  widest  spectrum. 

  These  conditions  bring  the 

supercontinuum closer to the ideal realization of a broadband, phase-coherent source.

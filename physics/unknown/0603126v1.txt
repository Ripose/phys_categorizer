Surrogate analysis of volatility series from long -range correlated noise 

Radhakrishnan Nagarajan 

 
Abstract: 
 
Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [1] of the volatility series has been found to be  useful in 

dentifying possible  nonlinear/multifractal  dynamic s in  the  empirical  sample  [2-4].  Long-range 

volatile  correlation  can  be  an  outcome  of  static  as  well  as  dynamical  nonlinearity.  In  order  to 

argue in favor of dynamical nonlinearity, surrogate testing is used in conjunction with volatility 

analysis [2-4]. In this brief communication, surrogate testing of volatility series  from long-range 

correlated  noise  and  their  static,  invertible  nonlinear  transforms  is  investigated.  Long-range 

correlated  monofractal  noise  is  generated  using  FARIMA  (0,  d,  0)  with  Gaussian  and  non-

Gaussian  innovations.  We  show  significant  deviation  in  the  scaling  behavior  between  the 

empirical sample and the surrogate counterpart at large time-scales in the case of FARIMA (0, d, 

0)  with  non-Gaussian  innovations  whereas  no  such  discrepancy  was  observed  in  the  case  of 

Gaussian  innovations.  The  results  encourage  cautious  interpretation  of  surrogate  testing  in  the 

presence of non-Gaussian innovations.

1. Introduction 

2 

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) [1] has been wide ly used to determine the scaling behavior 

of  synthetic  and  natural  processes.  Subsequently,  several  extensions  of  the  DFA  have  been 

proposed [2-6]. More importantly,  long-range correlation in the magnitude series (volatility) has 

been used to  be  an  indicator of  nonlinear/multifractal  dynamics  in  the  empirical  sample  [2-4]. 

However, long-range volatile correlations can also be an outcome of a static nonlinear transforms 

of  monofractal  noise  and  may  not  necessarily  guarantee  existence  of  dynamical  nonlinearit y. 

Such  static  nonlinearities  are  trivial  and  can  be  attributed  to  the  transfer  function  of  a 

measurement device that maps underlying dynamics onto the given empirical sample. In order to 

make  a  finer  classification  on  the  nature  of  nonlinearity  giving  rise  to  long-range  volatile 

correlation,  surrogate  testing  is  often  used  in  conjunction  with  traditional  volatility  analysis. 

Rejecting the null hypothesis has been used to argue in favor of dynamical nonlinearity in the 

given  empirical  sample.  Long-range  correlation  is  indicative  of  non-markovian  dynamics  and 

there has been recent interest in modeling such a behavior using FARIMA (fractional integrated 

moving  average)  models  [7-9].  In  this  letter  we  investigate  volatility  series  generated  from 

FARIMA models with Gaussian,  non-Gaussian  innovations and their static invertible nonlinear 

transforms.  We  show  that  volatility  analysis  in conjunction with  surrogate  algorithms,  namely: 

Phase-randomized  (FT)  [10],  amplitude  adjusted  Fourier  transform  (AAFT)  [10]  and  iterated 

amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (IAAFT) [11] can be useful in identifying the nature of the 

process for empirical samples generated from FARIMA (0, d, 0) with Gaussian innovations and 

their static,  invertible  nonlinear  transforms. However, their  limitations  are  clearly  drawn  in  the 

presence of non-Gaussian innovations. This is reflected by significant discrepancy in the scaling 

of  the  volatility  series  between  the  empirical  samples  and  their  surrogate  realizations  at 

considerably large time scale s in the case of non-Gaussian innovations. The present study is also 

in  conjunction  with  our  investigation  on  the  impact  of  non-Gaussian  innovations  on  surrogate 

testing [12].

1.1 FARIMA (Fractional Integrated Moving Average) models 

Classical modeling of stationary linear process relies on Wold decomposition theorem [13]. This 

in turn has given rise to the family of models termed as ARMA consisting of a deterministic auto-

regressive  part  (AR)  in  conjunction  with  non-deterministic  moving-average  part  (MA).  An

markovian in nature and can be useful in modeling short-term correlations. However, there have 

been several instances where the given empirical sample exhibits non-markovian  or  long-range 

correlated behavior. These models are termed as stationary fractional ARIMA or FARIMA (p, d, 

q) models. FARIMA (0, d, 0) is a special case of FARIMA (p, d, q) whose behavior is solely 

governed by the parameter d. The expression for FARIMA (0, d, 0) [7-9], (proposition 2.2 [8])

. In order to minimize possible crossovers 

in  the  plot  of  the  fluctuation  function  versus  time  scale  that  can  be  an  outcome  of  short-range 

correlation we restrict the present study to FARIMA (0, d, 0) with (d < 0). 

In the following sections we shall use the following abbreviations 

AWGN  (additive  white  Gaussian  noise):  FARIMA  (0,  d,  0),  with  innovations  sampled  from 

Gaussian distributed i.i.d process, normalized to zero-mean unit variance. 

NAWGN (nonlinear transform of AWGN): AWGN passed through a static, invertible , nonlinear 

filter

AWNGN  (additive  white  non-Gaussian  noise):  FARIMA  (0,  d,  0),  with  innovations  sampled 

from square of Gaussian distributed i.i.d process, normalized to zero-mean unit variance.

It  is  important  to  note  that  AWGN  is  normally  distributed  whereas  NAWGN,  AWNGN, 

NAWNGN are non-normally distributed. The parameter d was fixed as (d = 0.3) corresponding to 

long  range  correlated  noise  with  Hurt  exponent  (a

  =  0.8).  The  asymptotic  expansion  (2)  was 

truncated to the first (M = 300) terms after initial experimentation. The number of data points was 

chosen  sufficiently  long  (t  =  1…105) after discarding the initial transients in order to minimize 

finite sample size effects. Following [4-6], volatility series of the above processes was generated 

as absolute value of their increments given by the expression

1.2 Surrogate Testing 

5 

In  experimental  studies,  one  often  has  a  single  realization  of  the  process.  Under  implicit 

stationary conditions it is reasonable to assume the given sample, also known as empirical sample 

to  be  representative  of  the  underlying  dynamics.  In  the  present  study,  we  consider  empirical 

samples  generated  from  AWGN,  AWNGN,  NAWGN  and  NAWNGN  as  described  above. 

Surrogate testing is used widely to make statistical inference of the process generating the given 

empirical sample. Three essentia l ingredients of surrogate analysis include (a) null hypothesis (b) 

discriminant measure (c) algorithm to generate surrogate addressing that specific null hypothesis. 

In the present study, scaling exponent  of the volatility series  estimated using DFA  is used as the 

discriminant  measure.  Three  popular  surrogate  algorithms,  namely  phase-randomized surrogate 

(FT)  [10],  amplitude  adjusted  Fourier  transform  (AAFT)  [10]  and  iterated  amplitude  adjusted 

Fourier transform (IAAFT)  are considered  [11].  Phase  randomized  surrogate  is  well  suited  for 

empirical samples generated by linear processes with Gaussian innovations, thus well suited for 

the analysis of processes such as AWGN. AAFT and IAAFT are well-suited  for  non-normally 

distributed  empirical  samples  such  as  those  of  NAWGN  and  AWNGN.  Recent  studies  have 

pointed out the superiority of IAAFT compared to FT and AAFT [11]. The details of the above 

surrogate algorithms can be found elsewhere [10, 11]. 

 

2. Results 

The distribution of AWGN, NAWGN, AWNGN and NAWNGN is shown in Figs. 1a, 1b, 1c, and 

1d respectively. The scaling exponent of AWGN and AWNGN was (a

 ~ 0.8 in time scales s = 25 

to s = 212) for the parameter (d = 0.3) and immune to the choice of the innovations as expected, 

Fig.  1d.  Estimating  the  scaling  exponent  of  the  empirical  samples  prior  to  analysis  of  their 

volatility series was done in order to make sure the finite sample size approximation (M = 300) of 

the asymptotic expansion (2) did not have a significant effect on the expected scaling behavior (a

 

~ 0.8) corresponding to (d = 0.3).  

6 

FT,  AAFT  and  IAAFT  surrogate  algorithms  by  their  very  nature  retain  the  power-spectrum of 

AWGN, NAWGN, AWNGN and NAWNGN, thus immune to the nature of innovations. This in 

turn implies the DFA scaling exponent of AWGN, NAWGN, AWNGN and  NAWNGN will be 

similar to those surrogate counterparts. Therefore, we restrict the following discussion  solely to 

the  scaling  of  the  volatility  series  of  AWGN,  NAWGN,  AWNGN and  NAWNGN  and  their 

surrogates.  The  power  spectrum  of  the  empirical  samples  generated  by  volatility  transform  of 

AWGN,  NAWGN,  AWNGN and  NAWNGN  and  those  of  their corresponding FT, AAFT and 

IAAFT surrogate realizations is shown in Figs. 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d respectively. The corresponding 

plot of the fluctuation function versus time scale is shown in Figs. 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d respectively.  

 

 

 

Volatility series of AWGN and those of their FT, AAFT and IAAFT surrogates exhibited similar 

spectral decay, Fig 2a.  The volatility scaling exponent of AWGN is (0.5) conforming to earlier 

reports.  The  spectral  similarity  of  the  volatility  series  between  the  AWGN  and  their  surrogate 

realizations is reflected by the similarity in the fluctuation function. Thus the null hypothesis that 

the  given  data  is  generated  by  linearly  correlated  process  cannot  be  rejected  in  the  case  of 

AWGN.  While  the  spectral  decay  of  the  volatility  series  of  NAWGN  showed  a  marginal 

deviation from  those  of  their  FT  surrogate  counterpart,  they  failed  to  show  any  significant 

difference from their AAFT and IAAFT counterpart, Fig. 2b. This can be attributed to the fact 

that  AAFT  and  IAAFT  surrogates  by  their  very  construction  retain  the  static  invertible 

nonlinearity  unlike  those  of  FT  surrogates.  From  the  above  analysis,  the  null  that  the  given 

process is generated by static invertible nonlinear transform of linearly correlated process cannot 

be rejected for NAWGN. The results in the spectral domain are also reflected by the plot of the 

fluctuation function as a function of time scale , Fig. 3b.  Spectral decay of the volatility series of 

7 

AWNGN  failed  to  exhibit  significant  difference  from  those  of  their  FT  surrogate  counterpart, 

whereas  they  exhibited  a  marked  difference  from  their  AAFT  and  IAAFT  counterpart  with 

dominant  low-frequency  signatures  in  the  surrogates,  Fig.  2c.  The  correspond  plot  of  the 

fluctuation function versus time scale exhibited similar qualitative behavior, Fig. 3c. These results 

are  contrary  to  the  usual  norm,  as  the  null  hypotheses  addressed  by  the  AAFT  and  IAAFT 

surrogates encapsulate those addressed by FT surrogates. Alternately, a significant discrepancy 

between  the  empirical  sample  and  their  IAAFT  (or  AAFT)  surrogate  implies  a  significant 

discrepancy  between  the  empirical  sample  and  their  FT  surrogate.  The  anomaly  in  the  present 

context,  can  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  FT  surrogates  retains  the  power  spectrum,  hence  the 

scaling  exponent  of  the  given  empirical  sample  and  implicitly  renders  Gaussian  structure  on  it 

and volatility scaling of linear process with Gaussian innovations is uncorrelated [2-4]. The fact 

that FT surrogate is immune to the distribution of the empirical sample also discourages its use in 

non-Gaussian settings such as AWNGN. Spectral decay of the NAWNGN and its corresponding 

surrogate  realizations  is  shown  in  Fig.  2d.  The  corresponding  plot  of  the  fluctuation  function 

versus  time  scale  is  shown  in  Fig.  3d.    While  the  surrogate  analysis  can  give  rise  to  spurious 

conclusion  in  the  case  of  AWNGN,  its  volatility  scaling  exponent  is  uncorrelated  (0.5)  which 

according  to  earlier  reports  [4-6]  might  indicate  that  the  given  process  is  monofractal  noise. 

However, the situation in the case of NAWNGN is more complex, where the volatility scaling 

exponent  of  the  empirical  sample   (>  0.5),  i.e.  long-range  correlated  indicative  of  possible 

nonlinear/multifractal  structure.  The  volatility  scaling  of  the  corresponding  FT,  AAFT  and 

IAAFT surrogate counterparts show a considerable deviation across a wide range of time scales 

compared to that of the empirical sample. Thus FT, AAFT and IAAFT reject the null and argue in 

favor of dynamical nonlinearity.  

 

 

Thus  from  the  above  case  studies  it  can  be  noted  that  volatility  analysis  in  conjunction  with 

surrogate testing can give rise to false-positive identification of dynamical nonlinearity in the case 

8 

of FARIMA (0, d, 0) with non-Gaussian innovations. Also, long-range volatile correlation due to 

static nonlinear transform can be accommodated by surrogate analysis in the case of FARIMA (0, 

d, 0) with Gaussian innovations, however, such an approach might not be adequate in the case of 

FARIMA (0, d, 0) with non-Gaussian innovations. 

 

 

3. Discussion 

Long-range volatility scaling has been found to be an indicator of nonlinear/multifractal dynamics 

in  the  given  data.  However,  long-range  volatile  correlation  can  also  be  an  outcome  of  trivial 

nonlinearity  such  as  those  of  the  measurement  function  with  no  relevance  to  the  dynamics.  In 

order to make a finer distinction between dynamical and measurement nonlinearities, volatility 

analysis is used in conjunction with surrogate testing. In the present study, surrogate testing of 

volatility  series  generated  from  FARIMA   (0,  d,  0)  processes  with  normal  and  lognormal 

innovations  and  static,  invertible  nonlinear  transforms  were  considered.  We  found  that  the (Ft, 

AAFT and IAAFT) surrogate algorithms were useful in statistical inference of FARIMA (0, d, 0) 

with  normal  innovations  (AWGN)  and  their  static,  invertible  nonlinear  transforms  (NAWGN). 

However,  volatility  scaling  of  FARIMA  (0,  d,  0)  (AWNGN)  showed  significant  discrepancies 

from  those  of  their  AAFT  and  IAAFT  counterparts.  While  volatile  correlation  of  AWNGN 

exhibited uncorrelated behavior across all time scales, those of their AAFT and IAAFT surrogates 

of AWNGN exhibited considerable correlations across large time scales. Interestingly, volatility 

scaling of AWNGN failed to exhibit any significant change from their FT surrogate counterparts. 

This is anomalous since the null addressed by AAFT and IAAFT encapsulate those addressed by 

FT. However, in the present context the anomaly can be attributed to the fact that FT surrogates 

implicitly  render  the  distribution  of  AWNGN  normal.  Volatility  scaling  of  the  surrogates  (FT, 

AAFT and IAAFT) showed significant deviation from those of the empirical sample generated 

from NAWNGN. While volatility analysis in conjunction with surrogate  testing (FT, AAFT and 

IAAFT) can be useful in statistical inference of FARIMA (0, d, 0) with Gaussian innovations and 

9 

their  static,  invertible  nonlinear  transforms,  their  choice  in  the  presence  of  non-Gaussian 

innovations  is  limited.  As  a  significant  difference  in  the  volatility  scaling  between  the  given 

empirical sample and their surrogate counterpart can be solely due to non-Gaussianity with no 

regards to dynamical or even measurement nonlinearity.

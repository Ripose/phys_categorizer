Xiao Jianhua 

Natural Science Foundation Research Group, Shanghai Jiaotong University 

Abstract: The vorticity plays an important role in aerodynamics and rotational flow. Usually, they are studied with 

modified  Navier-Stokes  equation.  This  research  will  deduce  the  motion  equation  of  vorticity  from  Navier-Stokes 

equation. To this propose, the velocity gradient field is decomposed as the stack of non-rotation field and pure-rotation 

field. By introducing the Chen’s S+R decomposition, the rotational flow is redefined. For elastic fluid, the research 

shows that for Newton fluid, the local average rotation always produces an additional pressure on the rotation plane. 

This item is deterministic rather than stochastic (as Reynolds stress) or adjustable. For non-elastic fluid, such as air, the 

research shows that the rotation will produce an additional stress along the rotation axis direction, that is on the normal 

direction of rotation plane. This result can be used to explain the lift force connected with vortex. The main purpose of 

this research is to supply a solvable mathematical model for the calculation of vorticity and pressure when suitable 

boundary condition is adapted. Based on this understanding, some way to control the movement of vortices may be 

produced. 

1. Introduction 

Keywords: vortices, rotation field, velocity field, Navier-Stokes equation, rational mechanics 

The Navier-Stokes equations are widely used in fluid mechanics as basic equations. Its effectiveness for simple 

fluid motion is evident. In fact, Navier-Stokes equation has been unqualifiedly used as the unique foundation of whole 

fluid dynamics. But, recently, enquiry about its reasonability and solvability has been proposed by many researchers 

[1-2]. Some even goes to claim  that the turbulence cannot be solved by the Navier-Stokes equation [3]. Then, as a 

natural consequence, we want to answer the enquiry about its solvability. 

Firstly, the introduction of motion equation is purely based the analogy of solid continuum. As this equation is 

“artificially” enforced on the motion of fluid, the pressure in Navier-Stokes equation has lost its intrinsic meaning as 

“static pressure” and become an adjustable “parameter” in the calculation of fluid mechanics. These phenomena are 

common practice in the fluid field calculation [4-6]. 

Secondly, the definition of vortex, based on the Stokes’s S+R decomposition [7], cannot well describe the local 

rotation and global rotation of fluid, when the average local rotation is the main role. However, for small average local 

rotation,  it  is a good  approximation [7]. Hence, one can only  say  that  the vortex  is  ill-defined.  The  ill-definition of 

vortex is the main cause which misleads many researchers on rotational flows. 

As  the  consequence  of  above  mentioned  problems,  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  is  ill-used  in  fluid  mechanics. 

Based  on  this  research,  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  is  correct  in  form.  The  research  shows  that,  by  discarding  the 

misunderstanding and extending the Stokes’s S+R decomposition to Chen’s S+R decomposition [7], the Navier-Stokes 

equation can be used for complicated flow and for turbulence. The results may help to rebuild our confidence about the 

Navier-Stokes equation for complicated flow and turbulence in fluid mechanics 

This paper, firstly, reformulates the Navier-Stokes equation by Chen’s S+R decomposition and, hence, reinterprets 

its intrinsic meaning. Then, the paper goes to define the “vortex”, based on the Chen’s S+R decomposition. By this way, 

the Navier-Stokes equation is decomposed into two kinds of motion equations. One is for non-rotation flow which is 

the same as the traditional form used in practice, another is for rotational flow which gives the motion equation for the 

“vortex” defined in the paper. For comparing, the intrinsic meaning of incompressible fluid is discussed, which is only 

meaningful for elastic flow.

So, from equations (5) and (11), there are two kinds of fluid rotation motion. For the first form, i.e. equation (5), 

when 

0=i

jS

  the velocity of fluid has no amplitude variation but has direction variation, which is expresses by local 

rotation. For the second form, i.e. equation (11), when 

0

the velocity of fluid not only has a pure local rotation 

~

but also has an amplitude incremental

As  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  is  linear  in  form,  any  fluid  motion  can  be  decomposed  as  the  stack  of  a 

non-rotational flow and a pure rotational flow. For the non-rotational has been well studied, this paper will put focus on 

the pure rotational flow. 

3. Rotational Flow with Chen’s Decomposition Form-One 

For the fluid motion, expressed by equation (5), there are two typical cases. 

(1). Non-rotation flow, defined by

This  shows  that  for  pure  infinitesimal  local  rotation  the  conventional  Navier-Stokes  equation  still  is  a  good

It shows that for a pure local rotation flow, the traditional strain rate 

i
js   is determined by the local rotation axe 

direction and local average rotation angle  Θ . It is completely determined by three parameters. From this point to see, a 

pure local rotation flow should not be described by the vortex defined by the curl of velocity field. The more suitable 

definition of pure rotation should be equation (21) or 

0=i

jS

.   

Notes that for plane rotation, if the rotation axe is along the 

3x   direction, the equation (21) becomes:

That is to say that a pure plane local rotation will cause rotation plane symmetric velocity gradient. In this case, if one 

uses traditional strain rate definition to calculate stress, he will report that there is an additional plane pressure. As we 

know that such an additional plane pressure does not exist for pure local rotation flow, one may find that symmetric 

strain rate should be defined by 

i

jS   rather than 

i
js . 

 

To see the 

0=i

  indeed defines the pure rotation motion, let write down the velocity field variation in full 

form:

(24) 

It shows that the velocity field is a pure rotation field. In this sense, it can be called as elastic rotation. 

 

So, the pure rotation of fluid should be defined by 

i

jR   for its rotation axe direction instead of the definition of 

vortex and by  Θ   for its magnitude instead of vortices. For the pure rotation flow, the 

i
jL   has only two independent 

parameters. So, if the mean flow velocity 
the pure static pressure 

0p   is viewed as the intrinsic parameter of fluid. That is: 

iU is given, equations (19) and (23) form a closed motion equation, where

It  is  the  tensor  form  of  angular  momentum  conservation  equation,  corresponds  to  the  usual  Euler’s  momentum

non-linear equation, some unstable solution may exist. So, this equation can be used to predict turbulent flow. To make 

this problem clear, the incompressible flow is considered below.

Hence, the incompressible flow is defined by:

It shows that not only the

Based on this research, the incompressible flow can be divided into the addition of a pure rotation and a volume 

contraction caused by local average rotation. Hence, the traditional definition of impressible flow is not correct when 

the local average rotation angle is bigger enough. 

For incompressible Newton fluid, the reformulated Navier-Stokes equation is:

Hence,  for  traditional  incompressible  flow,  the  equations  (26)  and  (33)  form  closed-form  equations.  Therefore, 

traditional  incompressible  flow  is  solvable mathematically.  The striking  feature of equations (26)  and (33)  is  that  it 

shows  the  parameter  λ  has  effects  on  traditional  incompressible  flow  when  the  local  rotation  angular  Θ   is  big 

enough. This conclusion has been well discovered by experiments.

That is to say that a pure plane local rotation will not cause rotation plane symmetric velocity gradient. In contrast, it 

cause the velocity increase along the rotational axis direction. For air flow, it expresses the hurricane. For water flow, it 

expresses the water burst along the normal of rotation plane. In fact, it is this mechanism which supplies the lift force 

needed for air-plane flying.   

 

To see the velocity variation for

It shows that the velocity field is increased by a factor 

/1

θcos

. Physically, it shows that the kinetic energy increase of 

fluid is achieved by such a form of rotation. For air-plane flying, the high the speed of flying is the bigger the lift force 

is [in fact the static lift stress is

So, if the mean flow velocity 

iU is given, equations (34) and (37) form a closed motion equation, where the pure

It  is  the  tensor  form  of  angular  momentum  conservation  equation,  corresponds  to  the  usual  Euler’s  momentum 

equation.  In  conventional  fluid  mechanics,  it  corresponds  to  the  vorticity  transport  equation.  In  form,  it  is  a  highly 

non-linear equation, some unstable solution may exist. So, this equation can be used to predict turbulent flow.   

If one takes the

The lift is just the Kutta-Joukouski theorem[9] in air-plane co-moving coordinator system.   

Based above discussion, it is reasonable to see that the equation (40) can be used to study aerodynamics.   

6. Further Discussion 

The  research  presented  here  is  focused  on  the  rotational  flow  described  by  Navier-Stokes  equation.  By 

introducing the Chen’s S+R decomposition, the rotational flow is redefined. For elastic fluid, the Chen’s decomposition 

form-one  should  be  used.  In  this  case,  the  research  shows  that  for  Newton  fluid,  the  local  average  rotation  always 

produces an additional pressure on the rotation plane. This item is deterministic rather than stochastic (as Reynolds 

stress) or adjustable. For non-elastic fluid, such as air, the Chen’s decomposition form-two should be used. For this case,

the research shows that the rotation will produce an additional stress along the rotation axis direction, that is on the 

normal direction of rotation plane. This result can be used to explain the lift force connected with vortex. The research 

shows  that  the  vortices  of  fluid  have  two  intrinsic  different  forms,  which  corresponds  to  the  two  possible  forms  of 

Chen’s decomposition of velocity gradient. This is very important to understand the many controversial results in fluid 

mechanics. For the transition condition from one-form to two-form or its reserve will not be discussed in this paper, as 

these problems should be related with the feature of fluid. The main purpose of this research is to supply a solvable 

mathematical model for the calculation of vorticity and pressure when suitable boundary condition is adapted.

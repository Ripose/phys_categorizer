ABSTRACT 
One  of  the  best  methods  in  inertial  confinement  fusion  (ICF)  is  the  concept  of  central  spark  ignition,  consisting  of  two 
distinct regions named as hot and cold regions and formed by hydro-dynamical implosion of fuel micro-sphere central spark 
ignition method in inertial fusion and fuel pellet design condition in fusion power plant has been investigated and fuel gain 
for  isochoric  model  in  this  method  is  calculated.  We  have  shown  the  effects  of  different  physical  parameters  of  inertial 
fusion on fuel gain and optimized limit for fuel density and fuel pellet radius (Hf = rRf ) has been calculated. 
 
       Key words: central spark ignition, isochoric model, fuel gain, fuel pellet radius 
 
 
 
 
      1. Introduction 
    The essential condition for functioning a nuclear power plant that compression and ignition in it is 
done by laser beam is [1]: 
     eHe fe eel Gp > 1                             
 
where eHe is the transformation coefficient for deposited thermonuclear energy caused by nuclear fusion 
reaction to electrical energy,fe is the energy ratio of the exiting beam to the electric energy entering to 
the laser system, eel  is the transformation coefficient of entering electric energy to the electric energy 
getting  to  laser(or  entering  gian  coefficient  of  the  system),  and  Gp  is  the  energy  multiplication 
coefficient in pellet (or pellet gain). For the minimum value of eq.(1) the values of eHe=0.4 , fe=0.25 , 
eel=0.05 and Gp=200 can be considered. 
 For calculation of energy multiplication coefficient the following equation can be used [2]: 
 
 
     Gp = elf Gf                                   
where elf represents the beam energy fraction used for fuel compression inside the pellet and Gf is fuel 
gain. A value for elf  is 0.05[2]. In this article, fuel gain will be calculated and the effects of different 
physical parameters on it will be considered. 
 
2. Description and circumstance of calculations 
      The isomole fuel of deuterium-tritium fuses and thermonuclear energy is released: 
 
     
 
where  the  energies  of    alpha  particle  and  neutron  particles  are  3.5  and  14.1  MeV  respectively.  We 
suppose all these energies to be deposited in fusion reactor core. If we consider neutron energy leakage 
from  nuclear  fusion  environment,  an  outstanding  loss  in  fuel  gain  is  created  that  it  is  investigated  in 
appendix. The fuel Pellets with initial fuel masses 1,3,5,7,10mg are considered and supposed to have 
two central region with radius Rs and non-central region with radius Rf (Rs<<Rf). In isochoric model

which  fuel  density  in  two  central  and  non-central  regions  are  equal,  at  first  by  a  laser  beam,  we 
compress  symmetrically  the  fuel  inside  the  pellet  and  then  by  a  laser  beam  with  higher  intensity, 
ignition in central region is created. Then the heat caused by this ignition enters the cold fuel around 
the central region and embraces the entire pellet. Therefore fuel gain of this system can be written as 
proportion of the deposited thermonuclear energy to the energy used for fuel compression and ignition:

where, Ef , Ec and Es are deposited thermonuclear energy, the energy used for fuel compression and the 
energy which causes the initial ignition respectively. In next section, these values will be calculated . 
 
 2-a. Calculation of thermonuclear energy 
     If qdt is the deposited energy from mass unite of reaction (3), fb is fuel fraction of used fuel inside 
pellet and Mf is total fuel mass inside pellet, then Ef can be calculated by: 
    Ef = qdt fb Mf                                                 
For calculation of fb, we have [3]:

where r , Mi , Ti , K, <sv>dt  and Cs are fuel density , average ion mass , ion temperature , Boltzmann’s

values of Mf from top  10,7,5,3,1 mgr 

 

 

 
    As Fig.1 shows, with increasing Mf and Hf, deposited thermonuclear energy increases and the best 
case  is  the  condition  that  in  a  pellet  with  a  constant  radius,  more  initial  mass  from  fuel  is  placed, 
because in this condition fuel density and consequently Hf increase. Fig.2 shows that in constant value 
of initial fuel mass, increasing of Hf value causes that Ef value to be increased and Fig.3 shows that in 
constant  Hf  value,  increasing  of  Mf  causes  Ef  to  be  increased.  In  summary  it  can  be  yielded  that  the 
bigger fuel pellets with more fuel mass leads to the more created thermonuclear energy. 

 2-b. Calculation of cold fuel compression energy 

                       (11) 

       The energy required for the compression of cold fuel, that its density is h time’s more than liquid 
hydrogen density, can be calculated by [2]:  
     Ec= 0.12 a h2/3 Mf    ,   a > 1                            
Where  in  this  equation,  a  is  called  isentrope  parameter  and  shows  the  deviation  from  fuel  complete 
degeneracy  [4].  In  this  article,  we  have  done  our  calculations  for  a=1,2,3,4  and  with  the  change  of 
variables as follows, we obtain convenient form for Ec : 
      Hf = H0 h2/3                                                           
2 Mf /4p)1/3                                             
      H0 = (3r0
Substitution of equations (12) and (13) in equation (11) yields: 
      Ec(MJ) = 0.12 a Mf Hf / (3 r0
                            (14 ) 
The dependency of Ec on isentrope parameter in above equation is clear and in Fig.4 we have shown 
that with increasing isentrope parameter, the energy needed for fuel compression increases. Also, Fig.5 
shows  that  in  constant  values  of  initial  fuel  mass  and  h  =  1500,  increasing  of  isentrope  parameter 
causes Ec  value to be increased. In summary it can be yielded that if we want the bigger fuel pellet or 
the more compressed fuel, the more compressing energy ( Ec ) will be needed.

2.c. Calculation of ignition energy  

       With introducing the ratio of fuel mass in hot central region to total fuel mass in the pellet with fs, 
we can write:  

      fs = (

)3

If Mi is average ion mass and Ts is ignition temperature in central region, for ignition energy we have 
[2]: 
      Es= 3 fs Ts (Mf / Mi)                    
For example, for Ts=20KeV and Hs=0.3gr/cm2, Es can be calculated with the following relation: 
      Es(MJ) = 64.8 Mf / Hf
 
The dependency of Es on fuel mass and Hf in above equation is clear and in fig.6 we have shown that in 
constant ignition temperature ( Ts = 20 KeV ) and fuel mass ( Mf ) ,increasing of Hf value causes Es 
value  to be increased. In summary it can be yielded that for bigger fuel pellet or the more fuel mass in 
pellet we  will need the more spark energy.

       Generally Gf is yielded from the following equation and figures 7, 8 and 9 show the circumstance 
of Gf variations for these parameters. Fig. 5 shows the fuel gain, Gf variations in Hf and Mf parameters. 
As we have shown in Fig. 7 for a constant value of Hf, more fuel mass inside the pellet yields higher 
fuel gain.

3.Results 
         Generally in mentioned central spark ignition method, we want the pellet design and the related 
parameters with that to be the way which fuel gain is higher in value. Therefore according to equation 
(4),  Ef  must  have  the  maximum  value  and  consequently  according  to  equation  (10),  the  value  of  Hf  

(cid:1)

5 

have  to  increase.  Also  the  denominator  of  equation  (4)  must  be  the  minimum  value  and  therefore 
according to equation (14) and (17), a maximum limit for Hf exists. This value that for it either Ef has 
higher value or Ec+Es has the least value, is the desired limit for design of pellet and fuel density inside 
it, which figures 6 and 7 show it clearly in different physical conditions. Therefore according to these 
diagrams, the best value for Hf is yielded too. Gain diagrams show that for increasing Hf value from0.3 
gr/cm2 to 1 gr/cm2 ,the value of fuel gain increases and this increase is independent on fuel mass and 
isentrope parameter. For increasing of Hf from 1 gr/cm2, fuel gain increases as for more fuel mass and 
less isentrope parameter, fuel gain has a bigger value. This condition continues to Hf = 3 gr/cm2 and 
after that fuel gain decreases. Consequently the value of H  f equal to 3 gr/cm2 is optimized value for 
pellet design.  
Appendix 
  We know that the 14.1 MeV neutrons from d-t nuclear fusion can release this energy in fusion  fuel 
region,  due  to  elastic  collisions.  But  otherwise  due  to  neutrality  of  neutrons,  they  will  have  leakage 
from the pellet region. The value of neutrons leakage energy in an isomolar d-t fuel is calculated by the 
following equation [5]:

where e,d,m,r and R are average neutron energy decreases in one collision, average  elastic scattering 
cross section, average ion mass, density and fuel pellet radius respectively. Fig. 10 shows the variations 
of deposited neutron energy versus time with different Hf values.

Time for different values of Hf [5] 

 
 
Fig.10  shows  that  the  results  for  an  equimolar  DT  sphere  at  a  density  of  104g/cm3  .It  indicates  that 
confinement parameter rR values greater than about 5 is necessary. For example,  rR =5, 30% of the 
energy is deposited before the neutron leave the medium, or in another case with  rR greater than 20, 
neutron energy deposition function is similar. The reason why energy deposition does not approach its 
full value (14.1 MeV) is that some energy is lost by the d(n,2n)p reaction which absorbs about 2.5MeV. 
The  deposition  time  scale  is  relatively  small,  typically  about  0.2  Pico  seconds  at  this  density.  For 

(cid:1)

comparison, the capsule burn time scale will be larger than former at least an order of magnitude, so 
that  neutron  energy  deposition  is  effectively  instantaneous.The  neutron  energy  decrease  in  each 
collision is [6]:

collision,  neutron  energy  after  collision  and  mass  number  of  the  material  in  which  neutron  enters  it 
respectively. With substitution of known values and without considering the equation d(n,2n)p we will 
have : 
     E = E0 exp[-0.64698n]                                            
   (21)  
Regarding to Fig.11, it’s implied that neutron with initial energy of 14.1 MeV will need exactly seven 
collision for depositing all of its energy in an infinite, homogeneous and equimolar d-t fusion region.

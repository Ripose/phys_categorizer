This article describes a laboratory or demonstration technique employing the bass guitar 
and  a  Vernier  LabPro  (or  a  PC  soundcard)  for  teaching  wave  physics  and  introducing 
Fourier  analysis.    The  Fourier  transform  of  an  open  string  provides  a  demonstration  of 
oscillatory  modes  out  to  the  20th  harmonic  consistent  with  expectations  containing  a 
fundamental  frequency  and  harmonics.    The  playing  of  “harmonics”  (suppressing 
resonant  modes  by  lightly  touching  the  string  to  enforce  nodes  at  desired  locations) 
demonstrates  oscillations  made  up  (mostly)  of  individual  modes.    Students  see  that  the 
complete  set  of  Fourier  components  (fundamental  and  harmonics)  present  on  the  open 
string  can  be  explicitly  connected  with  individual  resonant  frequencies  as  described  in 
typical  textbook  discussions  of  natural  frequencies  of  waves  on  a  string.    The  use  of  a 
bass  guitar  rather  than  the  six  string  electric  guitar  allows  higher  harmonics  to  be 
individually excited, and it is also easier for students to play the harmonics themselves.

Introduction

The Physics of standing waves on a string are described in many introductory textbooks.   

The wavelength, λ1, of the fundamental mode of oscillation is twice the string length, and 

in  general, the  nth  mode of  oscillation  has  a  wavelength  λn=  λ1/n,  where n  is  a  positive 

integer.    This  produces  resonant  modes  with  frequencies  fn=  nf1,  where  f1  is  the 

fundamental oscillation frequency.

A visualization  of some resonant modes is  shown in  Fig. 1.   In  general, many resonant 

modes of oscillation are present in a vibrating string, and the resulting sound depends on 

the  relative  amplitudes  and  phases  of  the  resonant  modes.    The  bass  guitar  provides  an 

example of waves on a string, and the resulting frequencies can be sampled simply with a 

microphone using either a Vernier LabPro and microphone and accompanying software, 

or  a  standard  PC  soundcard,  microphone,  and  Audacity1  software.    Either  approach 

allows for viewing of the Fourier transform of the sampled sound waveform representing 

the  frequency  spectrum  of  the  sound  that  is  produced  from  whatever  oscillatory  modes 

are  present  on  the  string.    Therefore,  the  resulting  frequency  spectrum  can  be  used  to 

determine the presence of resonance modes on the string.  This technique can be used to 

determine  the  frequency  of  resonant  modes  to  within  2  Hz  using  a  sampling  time  of  1 

second.

Resonant Modes in an Open String

Playing the open A string results in the sound waveform and frequency spectrum shown 

in Fig. 2. The fundamental frequency is 55 Hz, and the first 20 harmonics are seen in the 

spectrum.  When presenting this as a laboratory or a demonstration, it is helpful to have 

students predict the position of each successive peak before zooming in on the graph and

verifying the expected frequency of the peak.  One can also gear the demonstration to 

audiences less adept at math by tuning the A string a bit flat to 50 Hz so that the 

harmonic frequencies can be computed quickly by the audience.

Many introductory students are exercising faith in the instructor’s expertise when making 

the connection that each peak in the frequency spectrum corresponds to a mode of 

oscillation such as pictured in Fig. 1.  Playing “harmonics” on the bass guitar string by 

lightly touching the string at a given point to force a node at that point can be used to 

build a firmer association between the resonance mode shapes in Fig. 1 and the spectrum 

peaks in Fig. 2.

For example, lightly touching the string at its midpoint, L/2 (just above the 12th fret) 

forces the string to have zero displacement at that point (a node).  This removes all the 

odd harmonics from the spectrum and produces a spectrum with only even harmonics as 

shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3: Frequency spectrum of open string with forced node at L/2 (12th fret) 

showing even modes of oscillation.

This process of forcing a node at the point L/n can be repeated for n=3, 4, 5 to suppress 

all the harmonics except multiples of n.  Fig. 4 shows that forcing a node at L/3 (just 

above the 7th fret) suppresses all the harmonics except multiples of 3.  Likewise, forcing a 

node at L/4 (just above the 5th fret) leaves only multiples of 4, and forcing a node at L/5

(just above the 4th fret) leaves only multiples of 5.  The correlation between the physical 

location of the node and the resulting spectra aids students in making the connections 

between the frequency spectrum and standing wave descriptions like Fig. 1.

Fig. 4: Frequency spectra comparison of varying locations of forced nodes.  

The process of forcing nodes at L/n can be repeated for n=6 through n=15 to demonstrate 

the nth harmonic in each case.  Finding the correct location requires more careful 

measurement since the nodes are no longer located at frets.  Successfully exciting single 

modes also requires progressively greater coordination between the plucking hand and 

the hand forcing the node.  Fig. 5 shows that harmonics 6-15 can be excited relatively 

independently of other harmonics, although there is some energy in unintended modes, 

and the low-frequency background grows, particularly in the 14th and 15th modes.

Conclusion

The bass guitar is an excellent instrument for teaching wave physics and introducing 

Fourier analysis.  When teaching this lab, we usually invite students to bring other 

musical instruments.  This stimulates discussions of how various aspects of timbre, 

acoustics, and electronic effects pedals can be understood via Fourier analysis, as well as 

how electronic synthesizers produce a variety of realistic musical instrument sounds.  A 

recorder or flute allows demonstration of standing waves in pipes.  Having students speak 

or sing into the microphone demonstrates the basis of voice spectrogram identification.  

Most students agree that the musical instrument experiments make for the most exciting 

laboratories of the term.

The bass guitar is also an excellent vehicle for demonstrating important ideas for 

resonance energy transfer in photosynthesis and other phenomena.  When one plays an E 

note on any one of the three higher strings, the lowest string left open (also an E note) 

begins to vibrate also with an amplitude that is easy to detect.  In response to this 

demonstration, a student asked whether this effect is similar to a demonstration by his 

music teacher by pushing down a piano pedal and causing strings to vibrate by singing 

musical notes without touching the keys.  The light turns on.

Abstract 
 
There exists an enormous interest for the study of very high energy domain in particle physics, both theoretically and 
experimentally, in the aim to construct a general theory of the fundamental constituents of matter and of their 
interactions. 
Until now, semiconductor detectors have widely been used in modern high energy physics experiments. They are 
elements of the high resolution vertex and tracking system, as well as of calorimeters.  
The main motivation of this work is to discuss how to prepare some possible detectors – only silicon option being 
considered, for the new era of HEP challenges because the bulk displacement damage in the detector, consequence 
of irradiation, produces effects at the device level that limit their long time utilisation, increasing the leakage current 
and the depletion voltage, eventually up to breakdown, and thus affecting the lifetime of detector systems. 
In this paper, physical phenomena that conduce to the degradation of the detector are discussed and effects are 
analysed at the device level (leakage current and effective carrier concentration) in the radiation environments 
expected in the next generation of hadron colliders after LHC, at the next lepton and gamma-gamma colliders, as 
well as in astroparticle experiments, in conditions of long time continuum irradiations, for different technological 
options. The predicted results permit a better decision to obtain devices with harder parameters to radiation.

1. New Physics Directions and Experimental Facilities 

 
In the last fifty years physics has made striking advances in describing the intimate structure of matter 
and the forces that determine the architecture of the universe. The simple structure of elementary 
constituents and forces forms the theoretical framework called the "Standard Model", which has been 
able to predict with very good accuracy the values of many quantities that have been measured by 
experiments at modern accelerators. But this theory is incomplete because: gravity is not included, it 
requires as input a large number of parameters, some aspects, as for example electroweak symmetry 
breaking, the striking asymmetry between the massless photon and the massive W and Z, the difference 
by many orders of magnitude between the masses of fundamental constituents or the number of flavour 
families are not yet completely understood. 
 
Experimental research in order to clarify these understood fundamental aspects is performed in the main 
areas: accelerator based particle physics, high energy astrophysics, astroparticle experiments and the 
study of the cosmology of the early universe. To obtain relevant answers to this quest higher energies are 
necessary, but this is not restricted to the highest energies, because at least observable traces of this new 

1

physics can be accessible also at low energy scales. So, new collider projects and studies of astroparticle 
physics represent two complementary links to the same scope. 
 
Discussions on the search for new physics at the future collider facilities are presented in references [1] 
and [2]; a review of this thematic at the interface between particle and astroparticle physics was done by 
Pinfold [3]. 
 
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be operational from 2007. But the physics results expected 
from this facility will not be able to clarify all the unknowns of the Standard Model. So, despite the 
technological difficulty, significant upgrades of the accelerator in energy and luminosity are already considered 
as Super-LHC and Very-LHC respectively. SLHC will represent an upgrade of the LHC collider while VLHC 
will be a new planned facility. The upgrade path will be defined by the results from the initial years of LHC 
operation, and now only possible scenarios can be done up to 240 TeV, the final energy of the project.  
The Ultimate Large Hadron Collider (ULHC) [4] is imagined as accelerating protons at energies above 107 TeV 
in a ring with a circumference L≈4×104 km around Earth and such a facility would permit to explore the 
“intermediate” energy scale, between the electroweek scale (1 TeV) and the scale of grand unification (around 
1014 TeV). 
 
Lepton colliders in the TeV scale would seem to be the tool of precision measurement of the new physics 
in this energy range. Requirements from physics are discussed in [5]. Unfortunately the performance of a 
multi - TeV e+e- collider is severely limited by breamstrahlung and (for circular machine) by synchrotron 
radiation. Two solutions are possible to minimise these effects: to build electron linear colliders [6], [7] 
or muon colliders [8]. Both alternatives are considered in present paper.  
 
The International Linear Collider (ILC) should be the next large scale project operating after LHC and 
with distinct physics goal. In the first stage a centre of mass energy of 500 GeV will be available, 
upgradable to about 1 TeV. The luminosity will be around 1034 cm-2s-1, corresponding to 
 200÷500 fb-1/year. The concrete realisation depends on the physics needs. At the present time different 
variants are discussed.  
 
e−γ  colliders with real photons on the base of a linear e+/-e- collider 
The idea of high energy 
is not new. In linear colliders each bunch is used only once. It makes possible to convert electrons to high 
energy photons and to obtain  
and luminosity as in the primary interaction processes. In these colliders, photon energy will be in the 
range from 100 GeV to several TeV, the number of high energy photons must be about 1010 per bunch 
with a transverse size at the interaction point (IP) close to 10-5÷10-7 cm. Detailed analysis of this subject 
has been performed by Telnov [9] and Serbo [10]. 
 
In the last period arguments in favour of lepton-hadron (as eLHC) and photon-hadron colliders in the 
same TeV energy scale are discussed. A review of this proposal and of its advantages for crucial 
clarification of the dynamics of strong interaction could be found, for example, in Ref. [11] and in the 
references cited therein. These possible facilities are not considered here. 
 
The main parameters of the future accelerator colliders, relevant for the present investigation, are 
presented in Table 1. For LHC upgrade, details could be found in references [12]] and [13]. .In Table 1, 
some characteristics of the background radiation in the interaction cavity where detectors work are also 
included. Details will be discussed in the next paragraph.

[6]

Another possibility to obtain information about the interactions of ultra high energy particles, complementary to 
colliders, is the exploitation of astroparticles or cosmic rays (CR). This supposes experiments with cosmic 
beams and terrestrial detectors, or complete experiments in space. We concentrate only to investigate effects to 
detectors in space. Galactic cosmic rays originating far outside our solar system are the most typical cosmic 
rays. They are the origin of the inner radiation belt, with their flux modulated by solar activity or as solar 
energetic particles. Protons are the most abundant charged particles in space. The CR proton spectrum, in the 
kinetic energy range up to hundred GeV, in the neighbourhood of Earth, as have been measured by the Alpha 
Magnetic Spectrometer during space shuttle flight STS-91 [17] for example, and their spectra was simulated by 
DESIRE Collaboration [18]. Extreme high energy CR particles, produced by different mechanisms, are not 
considered because their flux is irrelevant to produce any effect of degradation in detectors. It must be 
mentioned that the domain of energy between 105÷108 TeV of the ultra high energy-CR, interpreted as the onset 
of extragalactic proton dominance in the data [19] is closed by the expected energy of protons at ULHC 
collider. 

 
In this work, the expected behaviour of detectors - only silicon option being considered, for this new era of HEP 
challenges, is discussed. Due to the existence, long time, of intense radiation fields in the environments where 
detectors work, bulk displacement damage in silicon is produced, and consequently effects appear at the device 
level that limit their long time utilisation, increasing the leakage current and the depletion voltage sometimes up 
to breakdown, and thus affecting the lifetime of detector systems.

2. Radiation Background for Detectors 

 
The overall detector performance in high energy experiments is dependent on the background particle 
rates in various detector components. The knowledge of mutual effects of the radiation environment 
produced by the accelerator and experiments represents one of the key issues in the development of 
detectors.  
Despite different colliding particle types and machine parameters, there are many common features of 
the radiation background in detectors at these accelerators. 
Particles originating from the interaction point and collision remnants are most often the major source of 
background in detectors at the hadron or lepton colliders. Beam loss in the vicinity of the interaction 
point is the second source of background. 
 
In silicon detectors, radiation damage is essentially correlated with the flux of particles and their energies 
in background, because they contribute to the rate of generation of primary defects in the material. Also, 
high instantaneous particle fluxes complicate track reconstruction and cause increased trigger rates and 
affect detector occupancy. The existence long time of high radiation levels will produce radio activation 
of detector components as well as radiation environment in the experimental hall and in its surroundings. 
 
In the LHC case, inside the tracker cavity, hadrons represent about 54% of all produced particles, and the 
pions are the most abundant, around 64% of all hadrons [20]. In the present work, the simulated charged 
hadron spectra at different positions inside the tracking cavity, for the concrete CMS future experiment, 
are used, from Reference [21]. The position (r=20 cm, z=0÷60 cm) which corresponds to the maximum 
in flux is considered. This particular choice does not affect the main conclusions, because similar 
radiation fields are predicted also by the ATLAS Collaboration. For LHC upgrade (SLHC and VLHC), 
the following hypotheses were considered: increase in luminosity and increase in the energy of the beam 
that, in agreement with Gianotti’s evaluations [13], conduces to higher values of the mean energy of the 
spectra. For this case, we supplementary supposed that the shape of differential energetic spectra of pions 
and protons remains unmodified, and is only shifted to higher energy. The same scenario is considered 
also for the ULHC case. 
 
At lepton colliders, the background arises from beam – beam effects, synchrotron radiation and muons. 
As we pointed out before, to create a γγ or a  eγ  collider, their parameters must be comparable to those 
in e+e- colliders. The main sources of background at photon colliders are hadrons, e+e-pairs and photons. 
Hadrons are produced in 
 processes. With a cross section of about 500 nb, for a typical 
luminosity of 1034 cm-2s-1 in an electron linear collider, the background rate is 0.5 events/bunch crossing. 
Electrons/positrons are produced as pairs or as low energy electrons after multiple Compton scattering 
(disrupted beams). If these low energy electrons can be removed from the IP, thus, the level of e+ and e- 
in the vertex detector is approximately the same as for e+e- collider [9], eventually with an additional 
contribution due the particles reflected by mirrors. The photons come from Compton scattering, 
beamstrahlung or from halo of X rays. 
 
For concrete estimation, following Telnov’s and Serbo’s conclusions we consider that at the electron 
linear collider and photon collider the luminosity is the same as at LHC, but the hadronic background 
rate is up to 5 orders of magnitude lower. We also suppose that the spectra are similar. 
 
The case of cosmic rays is different. If one considers that silicon detectors will be exposed directly in 
space, thus, in essence their degradation is produced by primary cosmic protons and supplemented by 
different contributions from other particles; if the detectors will be placed in a cavity, the contribution 
from background must also be considered.

3. Interactions of Particles in the Detector and the Kinetics of Defects 

The nuclear interaction between the incident particle and the lattice nuclei of the detector produces bulk 
defects. After this interaction process, the recoil nucleus or nuclei are displaced from lattice positions 
into interstitials, in their initial positions remaining vacancies. Then, the primary knock-on nucleus, if its 
energy is large enough, could produce the displacement of a new nucleus, and the process continues as 
long as the energy of the colliding nucleus is higher than the threshold for atomic displacements. The 
physical quantity characterising the process is the concentration of primary defects produced per unit of 
fluence of the incident particles (CPD(E)). 
The primary recoil is either a nucleus of the medium (produced in an elastic or quasielastic interaction 
process), or a nucleus with a lower mass and charge numbers - after inelastic interactions. As a 
consequence, for each medium a whole family of curves, L(ER), function of incident energy, i.e. energy 
spent into non-ionising processes versus recoil energy, could be obtained. These are the Lindhard curves 
and are used in the evaluation of the damage produced in materials. The concentration of the primary 
radiation induced defects per unit of particle fluence could be calculated using the explicit formula:

as could be seen in Figure 1. In this region, the values of CPD are nearly equal for different hadrons.  
 
In the case of μ+μ- collider, the mean values of energies of electrons correspond to their asymptotic 
region in CPD. Also, in accord with Geer’s simulations [16], at 5 cm from vertex there will be 1.69×10-7 
photons, 8.4 ×10-11 electrons, 1.6×10-9 neutrons, per act of muon - muon interaction, and 4.4×10-10 (γ) 
and 1.5×10-9 (n) in the tracker, at 50 cm. Other contributions are irrelevant. 
 
In the last years, the CR proton spectrum, in the neighbourhood of Earth, has been measured by the AMS 
experiment during the space shuttle flight STS-91 and published in Ref. [17]. In reference [18], Ersmark 
and co-workers presented the belt proton spectra at 51.60 and at 330, 380 and 430 km, simulated with 
GEANT4, for the International Space Station orbit in free space as well as the effects due the presence of 
the station. The spectra of secondary particles entering the Columbus cabin have also been simulated and 
were considered in the present analysis. Primary cosmic ray protons have energies in the range between 
some MeV up to 105 GeV. 
 
In Table 2, we present the calculated values for the rate of generation of primary defects in silicon, in the 
radiation fields corresponding to different future facilities.

CPD is not proportional to the modifications of material parameters after irradiation, due to the subsequent 
interactions of vacancies and interstitials and with other defects and impurities (only phosphorus, carbon and 
oxygen are considered as pre-existents) in the silicon lattice.  
The formation and time evolution of complex defects, associations of primary defects or of primary defects and 
impurities are studied in accord with the model developed in successive steps by the authors; see for example 
[22] and previous results cited therein. 
The primary point defects considered here are silicon self interstitials and vacancies: “classic” vacancies and 
fourfold coordinated vacancy defects - SiFFCD. This new defect has been predicted by Goedecker and co-workers 
[23] and its characteristics were indirectly determined by Lazanu and Lazanu [24].

The rate G is a sum of contributions from thermal generation and irradiation. The phenomena occurring in the 
material after primary defect production are considered in the frame of the theory of diffusion limited reactions. 
The complete list of reactions considered is also presented in Ref. [24]. 
The model predicts absolute values for microscopic quantities – concentrations of defects which could be 
used to evaluate device degradation, without free parameters. 
 
Until now, systematic experimental studies to put in evidence detector degradation were realised by 
exposing these devices in radiation fields at different irradiation facilities by step by step 
irradiations/relaxations, up to fixed fluences. In fact, these experimental setups differ from realistic 
conditions where detectors are exposed for long times to continuous irradiation fields. These 
experimental results were utilised as a useful tools to test the validity of the theoretical model developed 
by the authors and to understand the mechanisms of damage and the results were presented in Reference 
[25]. In spite of the simplicity of the model, a remarkable agreement was obtained between model 
calculations and experimental data for leakage current and effective carrier concentration, considering 
different materials (FZ and DOFZ silicon), with resistivities in the range 1÷15 kΩcm, and irradiated with 
protons, pions, neutrons and electrons . In the case of CZ silicon technology the model is able to 
reproduce the situations corresponding to low fluences (beginning of irradiation), but supplementary 
processes must be considered, most probable associated with the presence of oxygen in the material.

The leakage current of silicon detectors scales with the rate of generation of primary defects, and is 
roughly independent on particle spectra as could be seen from the examination of Figures 2b and 3b. 
 
In Figures 4 and 5, the time evolution of effective carrier concentrations after irradiation, calculated in 
the same hypotheses and environments, is presented. For both materials, for rates of generation of defects 
below 105 pairs/cm3/sec (corresponding to cosmic fields and ILC), the inversion does not occur, and for 
DOFZ material the modification of Neff is irrelevant.  
The predicted results suggest that the DOFZ Si is radiation harder only in conditions of weaker radiation 
fields (as cosmic and ILC ones) and the behaviour of DOFZ silicon detectors is satisfactory in the first 
months of operation at μ+μ- and LHC and its upgrades. For longer time of irradiation at these last 
facilities, it is not possible to make a choice between FZ and DOFZ materials. So, DOFZ technology is 
more useful for low rates of primary defects and/or relatively short times of exploitation.

5. Conclusions and Summary 

 
The main features of microscopic and macroscopic degradation of detectors, after lepton and hadron 
irradiations, produced in silicon grown by FZ and DOFZ technologies could be reproduced in the frame 
of the present model. The pre-existence of phosphorus, oxygen and carbon impurities, the generation of 
primary defects: self-interstitial, classical and fourfold coordinated vacancy - SiFFCD thermally and in 
irradiation processes, as well as their kinetics are major physical aspects that must be considered. 
 
The effects of the radiation in silicon are dependent on the rate of generation of primary defects, but they 
are neither clearly correlated with the concentration of oxygen in silicon – except the case of low rates or 
short time of irradiation, nor with the resistivity of the starting material in the range 1 ÷ 15 KΩcm. The 
identity of the primary particle which initiated the bulk processes is lost after the primary interaction.  
 
For continuous irradiation, the obtained results suggest that the differences between DOFZ and FZ 
silicon could be observed only in the first months of operation, where DOFZ silicon seems radiation 
harder. For long times of irradiation and / or high fluences, it is not possible to make a choice from FZ 
and DOFZ materials. DOFZ technology is more useful for low rates of primary defect generation and in 
conditions of relatively short times of exploitation. 
 
The calculated degradation of the leakage current of silicon detectors scales with the rate of primary 
defect generation. 
 
In agreement with model predictions, the contribution of primary defects is important and must be 
considered. 
 
These processes have temperature dependence and the decrease of the temperature is strongly required in 
order to diminish these macroscopic effects.

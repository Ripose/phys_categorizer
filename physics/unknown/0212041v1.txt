1.   ABSTRACT 

 
At  SYRTE  in  Paris  two  Cs  fountains  and  a  87Rb  one  have 
been already demonstrated. [Refs 1, 2]. This paper illustrates 
the  construction  of  a  87Rb  and  Cs  dual  fountain  realized 
within the same structure to work simultaneously. Up to now 
only  the  Cs  part  is  under  operation  but  Rb  part,  already 
completed,  will  be  soon  operational.  The  experiment  has 
been  projected  to  improve  present  fountain  standards  and  to 
perform  a  more  precise  laboratory  test,  at  10-16  level,  on  a 
possible time variation of fine structure constant α as recent 
cosmological evidences strongly motivates [Ref. 3]. 
 
Keywords:  RbCs  fountain  standard,  laser  cooling,  α  time 
variation. 
 

2.  DUAL  FOUNTAIN  AND  TIME  VARIATION 
OF THE FINE STRUCTURE CONSTANT 
 

In Prestage theoretical framework [Ref. 4] experiments have 
been already performed to measure an eventual time variation 
of fine structure constant α. Previous measurements using Cs 
and Rb LPTF fountains have shown no α variation at 7x10-15 
per  year  level.  Dual  fountain  project  had  been  developed  to 
take advantages of the same experimental structure to reach a 
more  accurate  evaluation.  As  C-field  and  black-body 
temperature  are  the  same,  their  fluctuations  are  strongly 
correlated.  Their  contribution  to  the  uncertainty  of  the 
comparison  is  then  rejected  at 
  56%  and  79%  level 
respectively  [Ref.  9].  Finally,  advantages  will  come  from  a 
simpler  synchronisation  of  the  fountains  sequences  which 
will result in a better rejection of the interrogation oscillator 
noise  and  synchronous  perturbations.  These  are  the  main 
reasons that make possible an evaluation of α variation at the 
10-16/year level.   

 
 
3.  EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 

The  dual  fountain  has  a  (1,1,1)  configuration.  Two 
optical  benches,  one  for  Rb  and  one  for  Cs,  provide  all  the 
radiations  required.  They  are  completely  separated  and 
independent each other and from the fountain structure. The 
benches    are    coupled  to  the vacuum  chamber  by  polarizing 
fibres through prealigned collimators. Dichroic plates will be 
used to mix 780 and 852 nm laser beams at the input of the  
collimators. 
In  the  same  trapping  region  Rb  and  Cs  molasses  are  loaded 
by  two  atomic  beams,  pre-cooled  by  a  chirping  laser 
technique.  Also  the  chirped  laser  benches  are  independent 
and coupled by fibres to the structure. 
Cs  optical  bench  is  composed  of  a  master  and  a  repumper  
both  SDL  cavity  extended  diode  laser  locked  by  using 
saturated  absorption  technique.  Optical  power  amplification 

 
 

 

 

is done by injection locking of two slave SDL diodes by the 
master. 
Detection radiation is provided by the repumper itself and by 
an  indipendent  low  noise  SDL  extended  cavity  diode  laser 
locked  by  using  an  FM  spectroscopy  technique  and  a  fast 
servo system. The detection power is servo controlled by an  
acousto-optic modulator. So far, contribution to the frequency 
instability from laser sources is σy(τ) = 9x10-16τ-1/2 [Ref. 8]. 
We collect up to 109 Cs atoms and detect up to 107 atoms by 
0.3 s loading time. Atomic beam flux is about 1012 atoms/s at 
temperature of the oven of  383 K. 
Ramsey  fringes  are  shown  in  figure  1:  launching  height    is 
region,  with  a 
typically  0.865  m  above 
corresponding 0.53 s between the two microwave interactions 
producing  0.94  Hz  FWHM  Ramsey  fringes.  A  really  good  
S/N ratio of 3000 was measured with π/4 pulses technique. 
The Rb optical bench is quite similar to the Cs one, except for 
the slave laser, which is a MOPA amplifier.

Two systems insure temperature control of the micro-
wave  interaction  region.  First,  an  aluminium  envelope 
wounded  with  twisted  Arcap  heating  wire,  separated  by  a    
µ-metal  shield  from  the  drift  tube  can  work  continuously 
without  perturbing  atoms.  It  maintains  the  temperature  at 
about  299  K.  The  second  system  ensures  the  fine  cavity 
tuning temperature of 299.12 K.  It consists of Arcap twisted 
wire wounded directly on vacuum drift tube to minimize the 
time  constant  of  thermal  exchanges.  So  far,  this  system  is 
pulsed, switched on only during trapping time by a 100 kHz 
AC to avoid any perturbation for the atoms. 
Temperature  is  monitored  by  three  100  ohms  platinum 
sensors  at  different  heights  of  the  tube  and  a  servo  loop  is 
going  to  be  put  under  operation  to  perform  a  0.1  K  control. 
Up  to  now,  a  1-2  K  fluctuation  is  insured,  leading  to  an

fountain can not reject. 
 
 

accuracy contribution of the black-body radiation shift of 2.5-
5x10-16. 

Magnetic  field  homogeneity  and  control  is  provided 
by  four  compensation  coils,  orthogonal  to  the  tube  and 
distributed along its height. In usual operation we generate a 
field of about 200 nT with 0.1 nT inhomogeneity as shown in 
figure 3. This homogeneity gives a contribution of 3x10-16 to 
accuracy budget. 
Another  control  consists  of  four  coils  also  distributed  along 
the tube height which provide a field of 400 nT in the cooling 
region. This field is servo controlled. The magnetic sensor is 
housed  at  the  height  of  the  trapping  region.  Extra  coils  are 
installed along the atoms path in order to avoid non adiabatic 
spatial variations of the magnetic field

Cs and Rb interrogation cavities are realized from the 
same  monolithic  copper  block  to  have  exactly  the  same 
temperature and then reject thermal fluctuation in comparison 
between  Rb  and  Cs  hyperfine  frequency.  They  sustain  the 
TE011 mode and they are both symmetrically fed through two 
iris  by  lateral  rectangular  cavities.  These  latter  are  both 
coupled to coaxial cable by an antenna. The TE011 loaded Q 
factor  is  about  7000  in  both  cavities,  while  the  degenerated 
TM111  is  strongly  coupled  by  a  piece  of  coaxial  guide  (anti 
resonant  with TE011)  that  prolongs  each cavity, to  detune its 
resonant  frequency  of  about  100  MHz  and  to  reduce  its  Q 
factor  less  than  1000.  To  minimize  microwave  leakage  a 
brazing  and indium o-rings are provided.  
The tuning of the cavities is done by fine polishing.  We have 
measured that at the temperature of 299.12 K the two cavities 
are  resonant  at  their  respective  atomic  frequencies  with  a 
detuning of less than than 10 kHz. This is quite important in 

 

 
Figure 5. Phase noise power density of Cs synthesis chain. 
 
 

The synthesis chain scheme is showed in figure 4.  Its 
phase  noise  spectral  density  at  9.192  GHz  (figure  5)  is 
described between 1 Hz and 30 kHz by the relation  

Sφ (f) = 2.1x10-8f-1 + 3.9x10-11   rad2Hz-1 

That  leads  to  a  contribution  to  stability  in  term  of  Allan 
deviation of  σy(τ) = 2.5x10-14τ-1/2 . 
As  local  oscillator  we  have  used  either  a  BVA  quartz  or  a 
Sapphire  Cryogenic  Oscillator  (SCO)  both 
H-Maser.  The  SCO  has  been  realized  at  University  of 
Western Australia [Ref. 6,7]. Now its performances has been 
improved  by  some  changes  in  its  cryogenic  structure  and 
power servo-loop. A stability of 3x10-15 up to 1000 s is now 
available,  then  a  thermal  derive  starts  of  about  10-13/day.  In 
figure  7  we  show  the  Allan  deviation  measured  using  the 
SCO free running as local oscillator of the fountain operating 
in  Cs  mode  only,  before  and  after  improvements.    An 
unprecedent  σy(τ)  =  3.6x10-14τ-1/2  up  to  20  s  was  obtained, 
while after changes we had measured a σy(τ) = 5x10-14τ-1/2 up 
to 1000 s. The worst result at 1 s is due to an excess noise of 
the fountain during the second run of measurements. We are 
investigating  about  it.  Up  to  know  this  stability  seems  to  be 
limited by the fountain itself.  In figure 6 is shown the Allan 
deviations measured with BVA and SCO locked on H-Maser

as  local  oscillators.  In  the  first  case  the  stability  of  the 
fountain  is  limited  by  the  BVA  at  σy(τ)  =  1.1x10-13τ-1/2  .  In 
the second case  the  H-Maser limits the fountain stability in 
short and medium term at σy(τ) = 6.6x10-14τ-1/2 . 
All  of  this  measures  were  obtained  detecting  about  107  Cs 
atoms using a time-cycle of 1.3 s and a FWHM for the central 
Ramsey fringe of 0.94 Hz.  

So far, the preliminary evaluation for Cs shows no particular 
problems  on  fountain  structure,  in  magnetic  field,  thermal 
gradient,  microwave  part.  If  we  consider  the  same  situation, 
for Rb we obtain an expected accuracy of 6x10-16. 
87Rb  part  of  the  dual  fountain  is  now  in  progress:  the 
apparatus  is  almost  completed  and  we  are  going  to  put  it 
under  operation.  A  straightforward  precise  evaluation  of 
accuracy both for Cs and Rb will be performed, together with 
a new measure of the two hyperfine frequencies ratio. From 
the Cs preliminary evaluation we can expect for Rb a better 
accuracy  than  in  the  previous  Rb  fountain  where  the  10-15 
level  was  reached  and  in  which  the  strongest  limitation  was 
due to microwave leakage [Ref 2].

the  accuracy  will  be  performed  soon. 

4.  CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
 
In figure 8 it is shown the preliminary accuracy budget 
of  dual  fountain  when  operated  Cs.  The  preliminary 
evaluation gives an accuracy of 1.2x10-15, a better evaluation 
of 
these 
measurements  the  fountain  was  run  with  about  106  atoms 
detected and Allan deviation of  σy(τ) = 1.4x10-13τ-1/2.  
Collisional shift uncertainty  has been evaluated at 30% level: 
this is conservative and work is in progress to reach a stable 
10% level. It seems to be hard but not impossible to get a few 
percent  level  in  order  to  attend  10-16  accuracy  region.  Also 
black  body  shift  uncertainty  is  conservative  waiting  for 
implementation  of  servo  loop  to  get  0.1  K  fluctuation.  This 
will improve to about 3x10-17  contribution to accuracy.    
First  comparison  with  Pharao  Cs  fountain  at  SYRTE  shows 
good agreement at 1σ level (σ=1.5x10-15) but more measures  
have to be taken.

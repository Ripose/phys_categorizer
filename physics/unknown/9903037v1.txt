Does God Play Dice with Universe: The Hydrogen Atomic model of

Bohr and de Broglie

1. Introduction.

In the last years some scientists think “how good is Niels Bohr’s atomic model?” [1].
My paper is restricted only to the above mentioned subject and does not pretend to make
any review of theory of “Hidden variable” and other phenomena. I quote only these papers
which I think are useful for understanding my work.

A. Einstein wrote: “Some notions, which have proved useful for the classification of
things,  have  gained  such  an  authority  among  us  that  we  often  forget  about  their  earthly
origin  and  take  them  for  unalterable  facts.  They  are  categorised  as  “mental  principles”,
“given a priori”. It is because of such delusions that the road of scientific progress often
remains impassable for a long period of time. Therefore, it is all but futile if we exercise a
little  in  analysing  the  freely  used  notions  and  identifying  the  circumstances  which
determine their validity; of how each one of them was derived from the experimental facts.
Thus  we  will  shake  their  excessively  high  authority.  These  concepts  will  be  rejected  if
they  fail  to  properly  legitimate  themselves,  corrected  if  their  adequacy  to  the  given
circumstances is too uncertain, or replaced by others if a new system, which we would for
some reasons prefer, is to be set up.” (Annalen der Physik, 51 (1916), p. 639-642.  A free
translation from German).

We hope to remind that all quantum laws were initially derived from the results of
experiments with statistical ensembles of quantum systems. Subsequently these laws were
applied to solitary quantum systems which are the elementary constituents of the statistical
ensemble.  This  is  easy  and  trivial.  Easy  because  it  is  not  necessary  to  search  for  other
properties of the solitary object and trivial because this transition does not  contradict  the
laws  which  govern  an  ensemble  of  identical  objects  (quantum  systems,  QS).  For  a
statistical ensemble of quantum systems the introduction of probabilities and the statistical
interpretation  of  results  are  inevitable,  but  it  is  not  sure  that  a  solitary  quantum  system

must  be  governed  by  the  same  principles.  To  be  more  specific,  I  can  explain  the  above
assertions with the help of an example:

The  law  of  radioactive  decay,  N=N0exp(-t/t ),  was  at  first  observed  experimentally
and after that derived from statistical considerations. N is the number of nuclei which have
not decayed for the time t; N0 is the number of nuclei at the initial moment of time (t=0)
and  t   is  the  mean  life  time  of  all  nuclei.  This  law  can  not  be  affected  by  any  external
interactions and is an universal one - it concerns all decays of any excited states of nuclei,
atoms, molecules and so on. It is very easy to transfer this law from a statistical ensemble
to one solitary object by introducing the probability (W) that this object does not decay for
a time (t): W=N/N0= exp(-t/t ). But this probability is a trivial application of a law which
concerns only a statistical ensemble of quantum objects. This probability is not a proof that
a solitary object does not have another cause for decay. If such a cause exists, it will be a
“hidden  variable”.  However  someone  insist  that  hidden  variables  in  quantum  physics  do
not exist..

Many  of  the  authors  think  that  the  theory  of  Bohr  about  the  hydrogen  atom  is  not
adequate  to  reality.  Bohr  himself  thinks  (and  writes)  that,  though  his  model  of  hydrogen
describes some properties of this atom very well, it can not be accepted as realistic... Now
it is considered to be almost a shame to think about this model as corresponding to reality.
Some textbooks for students discuss this model of Bohr, but only as a curious example of
an inadequate model which can lead to some true results [2]...

[3]...For  example, 

In  this  paper  I  hope  to  show  that  this  understanding  has  no  foundations.  It  stems
from  some  mystic  assumption  about  quantum  physics 
the
complementarity  principle  postulated  by  Niels  Bohr  [4]  in  1927,  assumes  that  the  wave-
particle  "duality"  is  a  property  of  a  single  quantum  system  and  therefore  its  two
complementary  aspects  cannot  be  observed  simultaneously;  in  some  experiments
(interference, diffraction) wave properties are manifested, some other experiments provide
evidence  for  the  corpuscular  properties  of  quantum  objects  (impulse,  energy).  It  is
impossible to observe the two phenomena simultaneously and, moreover, they cannot exist
simultaneously ...

In the paper [5] it was shown that in the case of waves on the surface of a liquid the
floating classical particles which pass through only one of the two opened slits are guided
by the interfering surface waves in the same directions (angle q ) as predicted by quantum
(q )‰ 2=0  are  not  allowed.)  This  is  an  indirect
laws  (‰
confirmation of de Broglie's ideas that wave and particle exist simultaneously and that this
coexistence is real [6]. Most of the scientists think that the field of de Broglie is not real
and  they  accept  the  statistical  interpretation  of  Born  [7]. One  of  the  most  often  stressed

(q )‰ 2=max;  and  the  directions ‰

disadvantages  of  the  model  of  Bohr  is  the  impossibility  to  determine  (calculate)  the
probabilities of transition (intensities) of the emitted hydrogen lines...

2. Return to the real unitary field-particle of de Broglie and to Bohr's model of

hydrogen atom.

I ask myself why the assumption that a wave-particle can not exist simultaneously is
more real than de Broglie's assumption that they always exist simultaneously [6]?. I hope
that  the  results  of  this  work  will  show  that  there  is  nothing  more  realistic  than  the
simultaneous existence of de Broglie's field and Bohr's atom ... and that (for one atom) no
statistical interpretation is necessary. De Broglie's waves in the hydrogen atoms are such
that in the stationary state the mass of the electron (m), its velocity vn , and average radius
rn are related with the principal quantum number (n= 1,2,3....) according to:

and the field-particle (electron) is in a potential well which guides the electron only
in  orbit  n,  in  which  case  the  electron  does  not  emit  photons.  The  length  of  de  Broglie's
wave l

n exactly satisfies the condition:

De  Broglie's  unitary  "wave-particle"  is  in  a  stationary  ("steady")  state  which  does
never  change.  The  "wave-particle"  electron  is  bound  together  with  the  "wave-particle"
proton by electromagnetic forces and de Broglie’ wave. They interfere and remain in their
potential well (position) forever, like classical particles on the surface of a liquid [5]. The
field of de Broglie is so real and this reality is so strong that the electromagnetic forces can
not destroy this interference and the field-particle (electron) can not emit a photon-soliton
[8,9].  In  order  to  explain  the  decay  of  a  stationary  state  it  is  necessary  to  assume  some
infinitely small "external perturbation" which would disturb the exact equalities (1) and (2)
and (after some time of destructive interference) permit the transition to lower states. Only
the ground state (2p
1; n=1) can not be disturbed by an "infinitely small perturbation"
because the field-particle can not be destroyed (n can not be smaller than 1). In this case
only if the perturbation energy is sufficiently great, the electron can make a transition from
the ground to the upper levels (absorption only, [10]).

Excited  by  some  energy,  the  electron  can  randomly  occur  at  any  distance  (rni)

interference leads (after some time) to a transition to lower states. We can imagine that the
"wave-particle"  electron  self-interferes  as  long  as  the  minima  of  the  wave  coincide  with
the  maxima  of  the  precedent  waves  (this  means  that  the  amplitude  (D)  of  the  interfering
0= ).  In  this  moment  a  transition  occurs  and  energy  is

When  the  energy  of  excitation  is  exact  (rni=rn),  a  true  stationary  state  would  be
established  and  without  external  perturbation  this  state  could  not  be  changed.  So,  it  is
evident  that  the  wave-particle  electron  can  be  excited  so,  as  to  occur  at  all  possible
distances r from the proton (except r<r0; ground state).

3. Own life time of a single hydrogen atom.

In  Fig.1  a  schematic  wave-particle  in  some  excited  state  of  the  hydrogen  atom  is
shown. The particle-wave electron moves from left to right (for example, n=2). In Fig.1 a)
the  velocity  of  the  electron  vn  is  such  that  l
n  and  rn  correspond  exactly  to  Bohr's
conditions:

Such a wave-particle electron returns from the left always with the same phase and
reiterates its motion for an infinitely long time. If the velocity of the electron (v) is slightly
different, the new l

 will also be slightly different (compared with l

Such a particle-wave electron  would  arrive  from  the  left  (Fig.  1  b))  with  a  slightly
different phase. With time this difference increases and we can calculate the moment when
the sum of two amplitudes becomes zero (for the first time). In this moment the electron is
2=0) and
not more in the potential well of the wave (like classical particles, [5], when ‰
is allowed to change its position. This moment will be the time of life of this excited atom.
The sum of the two amplitudes of de Broglie' field (D) can be written (like with classical
particles, [5]):

Thus, the  life  time of each  single  excited hydrogen atom depends on the small energy
difference (D E) and the principal quantum number (n):

Part of the results are shown in the Fig.2 (for ! =6.59x10-16 eV.s and R=13.595 eV).
These  curves  are  different  for  different  excited  states  (n).  They  could  be  compared  with
the normalized "own lifetimes" of nuclei (t / t

 and D E /G

)  [11].

4. The natural width and mean life time of an ensemble of excited hydrogen

atoms

Similar to the results in [11], we established that the "own life time" (t) of one single

excited atom (in state (n)) depends exactly on the energy difference (D E ) (17).

This time cannot be measured experimentally (except in the case shown in [11] for
resonant  Mossbauer  transitions  in  nuclei).  Experiments  with  hydrogen  measure  only  the
mean life time of an ensemble of excited atoms.

Further  we  attempt  to  find  the  statistical  natural  width  of  the  levels  (G

n)  and  mean
life  times  (t
n )  (for  different  excited  states)  of  an  ensemble  of  hydrogen  atoms  and
compare  these  life  times  with  reference  data.  Let  us  assume  that  N0  [cm-3]  atoms  (thin

n) of level (n) it is easy to derive the mean life time of all excited atoms

Thus, for calculation of the full mean life time of an excited hydrogen level (n), only
Rydberg's  constant  (R)  and  Planck's  constant  (! )  are  needed.  The  corresponding  decay
constant (the spontaneous coefficient of Einstein) is An=1/t

5. Comparison with reference data.

In  the  numerous  reference  tables  on  hydrogen  I  found,  to  my  great  surprise,  quite
different  values  for  t
n   (especially  for  high  excited  states).  In  Table  1  below  I  quote  the
data  from  [12]  (1966)  and  [13]  (1986)  and  compare  them  with  my  calculations  (formula
31, 1997).

So, the result from the present calculations is in excellent agreement with reference
data [13] (for n=2). It is necessary to stress that my calculations fit better to the values in
[13]. The differences between the values in [12] and [13] are greater than the differences
between my calculations and the data in [13]. So, the Bohr’s model (complemented with de

Broglie’ ideas) continue to describe hydrogen properties (mean life time, natural width of
the levels) as exactly as Bohr’s hydrogen model describes the frequency of radiation.

6. Differences between the data.

As it is known, the experimental accuracy for frequency measurement is very great
in  comparison  with  accuracy  of  time  measurements.  Here  I  will  attempt  to  explain  the
great  differences  between  reference  data  (for  n>3).  Experimental  results  are  very  good
only  for  the  first  excited  states...  I  think  that  the  differences  between  reference  data  (for
n>3) are due both to experimental difficulties and (mainly) to the wrong application of the
relation between Einstein's coefficients, which is explained in [10,14].

The  obtained  in  this  paper  mean  lifetimes  of  excited  levels  of  the  simplest  atom  -
hydrogen - are in surprising agreement with the known data for n=2. At the same time, the
differences  between  the  reference  values  for  n>2,  shows  that  all  reference  data  for
transition  probabilities  in  hydrogen  must  be  critically  examined  and  adjusted  accurately
according these results.

7. Mossbauer experiments in the energy and time domain

It is clear that the different regions of the level’s Lorentzian population must decay
at  exact  (and  different)  moments  of  time  (t),  and  the  emitted  photons  must  have  the
energies  of  these  regions,  i.e.  E1,  E2,  E3  (Fig.  5,  a).  It  is  very  difficult  to  verify  this  fact
experimentally (for hydrogen) because of two insurmountable difficulties:a) the absence of
detectors with such high time and energy resolution and b) the natural line of the hydrogen
atom  cannot  be  observed  experimentally  (the  actually  emitted  line  is  many  times  wider
than the natural level width, G
n). Natural lines of emission can be observed experimentally
only  with  nuclei  which  have  Mossbauer  transitions  (between  the  ground  and  the  first
excited  state).  As  it  is  known,  Mossbauer  experiments  in  transmission  geometry  are
normally  performed  with  a  very  thin  Mossbauer  source  (in  order  to  obtain  a  natural
Lorentzian  line).  The  emitted  photons  pass  through  a  resonant  absorber  (with  arbitrary
thickness) and the transmitted quanta are registered by a detector. A specific example of an
experiment  with  the  natural  width  of  the  emitted  Mossbauer  line  is  shown  in  Fig.5,a)
(curve 1). The relative velocity between source and absorber (v, in units G ) changes only
the resonant (nuclear) absorption and cannot change the atomic absorption. Thus, curve 1
corresponds  to  the  case  when  resonant  absorption  does  not  exist  (v>>G ),  and  curve  2
corresponds  to  the  case  when  the  maxima  of  emission  coincide  with  the  maxima  of
absorption (v=0). As it must be (for a very thick absorber), the recoilless gamma-quanta in
the central region (E3) are almost completely absorbed (point I=0.1). At the wings of this
line  absorption  can  be  neglected  (curve  1  coincides  with  curve  2  (E1)).  The  areas  S1
(below  curve  1)  and  S2  (below  curve  2)  of  regions  (E1,  E2,  E3)  are  proportional  to  the
numbers of the photons emitted in these regions. Thus, in the two cases (v>>G
 and v=0)
the ratio of the areas (in regions E1) is: S2E1/S1E1=1, whereas in regions (E2) this ratio is
S2E2/S1E2<1. In the central regions (E3) only those gamma quanta which are emitted with
recoil  (1-f)  pass  through  the  very  thick  absorber  (the  region  below  I=0.1).  Recoilless
quanta (f) are completely absorbed and this ratio is: S2E3/S1E3=(1-f)/1.

With  the  same  experimental  setup,  but  using  time-coincidence  techniques,  Time
Domain  Mossbauer  Experiments  (TDME)  [15]  can  be  performed  (Fig.  5,b).  The  start
signal  is  triggered  by  the  preceding  transition,  which  is  the  moment  of  formation  of  the
first  excited  state  and  the  stop  signal  is  the  moment  of  detection  of  recoilless  or  recoil
quanta  which  have  passed  through  the  absorber.  Thus,  the  time  between  the  two  signals
could  be  interpreted  as  the  "own  lifetime"  of  the  first  excited  Mossbauer  level.  This
assertion is valid only in some specific cases where the time dispersion in the absorber can
be neglected.

Time  domain  Mossbauer  experiments  qualitatively  confirm  the  concept  of  “own
lifetimes” [11] of nuclei. At different times of coincidence (t), the widths of regions (E1,
E2, E3) will be different, provided that the time resolution of the detector (D
t) is constant
[11].

At the moment t=0–

t the ratio of the numbers of coincidences for the two cases is
equal  to  1,  which  corresponds  to  the  ratio  (S2E1/S1E1).  At  time  t>3t
t  the  ratio  of  the
numbers  of  coincidences  is:  (1-f),  corresponding  to  (S2E3/S1E3).  These  specific  time
domain experiments were repeated many times after Lynch [15]. In Fig. 5,b) the solid line
corresponds to the theory in [15], and the dotted line corresponds to my calculations [11].

experiments  show  that  first  decay  the  nuclei  in  regions  E1  (t=0–
t)),  and  the  nuclei  of
regions  E3  decay  long  after  those  in  regions  E1.  These  experiments  show  that  for
Mossbauer  transitions  the  own  lifetime  of  the  nucleus  depends  on  the  energy  difference
D E=Er-E (like for the hydrogen atom). The energy spectrum (Fig. 5 a) was confirmed in
the excellent experimental work of Mandjukov et al. (with the help of resonance detector,
[17]).

I  think  that  these  experimental  results  (comparison  between  time  and  energy
domains)  cannot  be  explained  with  other  phenomena  except  the  “own  lifetime”.  This
conclusion is inevitable, unless one resorts to some mystic assumptions (for example that
recoilless (f) and recoil (1-f) nuclei decay at different moments after the excitation).

8. Some inevitable conclusions.

The  main  result  of  this  work  (and  works  [11])  is  that  the  first  excited  states  of  a
quantum system decay after some exactly predictable time (t) according to (17). Decay is
not an accidental event as it is believed by the majority of scientists (except Einstein who
wrote  that  a  weakness  of  the  theory  of  radiation  is  that  the  time  of  occurrence  of  an
elementary  process  is  left  to  "chance"  [16]). The  mean  life  time  (t
n )  is  a  characteristic
only of a statistical ensemble of excited atoms.

I  understand  that  now  it  is  very  difficult  to  accept  the  concept  of  solitary  quantum
systems (SQS). In present days the majority of scientists believe that quantum physics is a
fully completed science. We know all about quantum physics, and what we know are all
properties  of  nature.  So,  we  could  not  hope  to  achieve  a  better  understanding  of  nature
because there are no hidden  variables.  Nature  is  governed  by  probabilities,  uncertainties,
duality, and so on...

A referee of “Bulgarian Journal of Physics” wrote the shortest negative reference on
my  paper  about  the  solitary  hydrogen  atom  (this  paper,  1997):  “This  paper  cannot  be
published in the Journal because the author writes that an excited state decays at an exactly
predictable moment of time”. This shortest reference was sufficient for the editorial board
to reject the paper... The Editor (my friend, M. M.) tells me the same expression ...

And  yet  another  example:  The  Editor  of  Physics  Letters  A  wrote  (more  than  the
first): “...Despite my considerable  efforts  I  have  been  unable  to  elicit  any  referee  reports
on your article and at this stage I do not think I am going to receive any reviews. In the
circumstances  I  believe  it  would  be  in  your  interests  if  you  submitted  your  article  to
another journal. I appreciate this is not a very satisfactory outcome but wish you luck  in
publishing your work elsewhere”. (The paper was written in 1997!).

This  situation  resembles  a  journey  through  the  jungle  to  a  city  to  which  there  are
numerous excellent roads. If someone of the travellers decides to cross straight through the
jungle, his fellows will try to stop him with the words: “You do not have to do this. All
roads lead to our city. It is dangerous and stupid to force your way through the forest and
the shrubs when you may take any of the beaten tracks…” However, they will never know
if amidst the jungle there exist other smaller towns or villages which may some day grow
into large beautiful cities…

This  article  is  a  step  aside  from  the  beaten  tracks.  Such  steps  may  prove  to  be
illusory or wrong, and none of them are the first ones in the corresponding directions. The
first steps were made by other people (mentioned in the paper). While some of the tracks
may  eventually  lead  nowhere  and  never  become  useful  roads,  all  roads  are  made  by
numerous travellers, each of them stepping slightly aside from his predecessor. Only when
the first one to pass is followed by many others, it is possible to open a new road. And, to
be sure, each road links places which are useful to people. As one Bulgarian poet (Penyo
Penev) wrote: “All roads lead to the men”.

If  the  first  traveller  does  not  find  something  useful,  if  he  fails  to  explain  its
advantages, or if there is no one to understand him, the first steps remain lonely for a long
time.  But,  of  course,  where  useful  steps  have  been  made,  sooner  or  later  there  will  be  a
road! Such is human nature, and one can feel pity for all those who suffer from the deeply
rooted illusion that only beaten tracks can lead us to something important.

I  hope  that  some  of  the  results  presented  in  this  article  may  shake  the  exaggerated
authority  of  the  existing  concepts  not  only  in  quantum  physics,  but  also  in  classical
physics. I am convinced that a great many of the delusions in quantum physics originate
from our wrong notions about nature, established as irrefutable truths in classical physics
already at the time of Newton and Galilee. The very separation of science into “classical”
and “quantum” speaks in support of this. There is only one physics, just like there is only
one  Nature.  We  simply  study  the  nature  of  things  (the  jungle)  still  deeper  and  deeper…
and in more details. A Spanish proverb tells: “Traveller, roads do not exist by themselves.
They are made by travelling.”

This  work  is  a  part  of  my  unpublished  book  entitled:  “Physics  of  Solitary
Quantum  Systems  -  From  Dice  to  Chronometers”.  It  is  shown  in  the  book  that  God
does  not  play  dice  with  solitary  quantum  systems  like  hydrogen,  nucleus,  photon.  God
does not play dice with Universe ... I  am  happy  that  now  (in  the  last  years  before  2000)
there exists the possibility for publishing such papers without a referee with deeply rooted
illusions ...

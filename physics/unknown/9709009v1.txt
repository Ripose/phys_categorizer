Abstract

A family of solvable self-dual Lie algebras is presented. There exist a few methods
for the construction of non-reductive self-dual Lie algebras: an orthogonal direct
product, a double-extension of an Abelian algebra, and a Wigner contraction. It is
shown that the presented algebras cannot be obtained by these methods.

Introduction

A self-dual Lie algebra A is a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra that admits an invariant
metric, i.e., a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form (·, ·) that is invariant under the
adjoint action of the corresponding group:

(gx1g−1, gx2g−1) = (x1, x2),

∀xi ∈ A,

for any g in the group, or equivalently,

([y, x1], x2) = −(x1, [y, x2]),

∀xi ∈ A,

(1)

(2)

for any y ∈ A (other common names for such algebras are “orthogonal” and “symmetric-
self-dual”).

Self-dual Lie algebras are important in physics. In string theory, one needs a (highest
weight) representation of the Virasoro algebra [1]. An important source of such repre-
sentations is the aﬃne Sugawara construction [2], starting from a Kac-Moody algebra
[3]. Self-dual Lie algebras are precisely the Lie algebras that are needed for such a con-
struction [4, 5]. From the point of view of two-dimensional conformal quantum ﬁeld
theories, a self-dual Lie algebra is the mathematical structure needed for the construction
of Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten (WZNW) models [6].

The best known families of self-dual algebras are the semi-simple algebras [where the
(essentially unique) invariant metric is the Killing form] and the Abelian algebras (for
which every metric is trivially invariant). However, these are not the only ones. Any
self-dual Lie algebra can be constructed, using semi-simple and Abelian algebras, by a
sequence of construction steps, each of which is either an orthogonal direct sum (i.e.,
a direct sum equipped with the natural direct sum metric) or a procedure called double
extension [7] (see also [5]). Self-dual algebras that are not orthogonal direct sums are called
indecomposable and those that are also non-reductive and are not double extensions of
an Abelian algebra will be called deeper (following [5]), since their construction involves
more then one step of double-extension. Another method to obtain self-dual algebras is
through a Wigner contraction [8], as described in [9]. A self dual algebra obtained by this
method is always a double extension of an Abelian algebra and therefore is not a deeper
algebra.

In this paper we present a new (as far as we know) inﬁnite family of indecomposable,
non-reductive (in fact, solvable), self-dual algebras {A3m}. We show that these algebras
(except the ﬁrst two) are deeper algebras, in the sense deﬁned above. Among the known
self dual algebras, deeper algebras are rare (in fact, we do not know any other examples).
The reason for this may be the absence of a practical method to construct such algebras
(as will be explained in section IV). Therefore the family presented here may provide
a valuable test-ground in the study of the properties and structure of general self-dual
algebras and the physical models based on them [10].

The algebra

An ≡ sp{Ti}0≤i≤n

is deﬁned by the Lie bracket

where ˆi ≡ i mod 3 is chosen to be in {−1, 0, 1}. When ˆn = 0, the metric

[Ti, Tj] =

(i − j)Ti+j
0

d

(

i + j ≤ n,
otherwise,

(Ti, Tj) = δi+j−n + bδiδj

is an invariant metric on An (for arbitrary b).

In section II we deﬁne the algebras An and prove that (for ˆn = 0) these are indeed
self-dual Lie algebras. In section III we ﬁnd all the ideals of An. This result is used in
section V, where we check which of these algebras is a double extension of an Abelian
algebra or a result of a Wigner contraction. Before that, in section IV, we describe these
two methods brieﬂy, emphasizing the gap that the algebras presented here may help to
reduce. Finally, in section VI, we comment about possible generalizations.

II The Algebra An

Consider a vector space, equipped with the basis {Ti}i∈ZZ and the following “Lie bracket”:

[Ti, Tj] =

(i − j)Ti+j,

where ˆi ≡ i mod 3 is chosen to be in {−1, 0, 1}. The map i → ˆi is almost a ring homo-
morphism ZZ → ZZ: it preserves multiplication,

d

and almost preserves addition:

(ij) = ˆiˆj,

d

(i + j) =

(ˆi + ˆj)

,

(−i) = −ˆi,

d

d

d
(i − j) = 0 ⇐⇒ ˆi = ˆj

(but note that ˆ1 + ˆ1 6=
following. Particularly useful will be the property

d

d

(1 + 1) [11]). These are the properties that will be used in the

ˆi = ˆj ⇐⇒

(i + k) =

(j + k),

which follows from (8).

d

The bracket is manifestly anti-symmetric so to obtain a Lie algebra, there remains to

verify the Jacobi identity. Since

[[Ti, Tj], Tk] = ˆcijkTi+j+k

cijk ≡ (i − j)(i + j − k),

the Jacobi identity takes the form

This identity holds without the ‘hats’, therefore, by (7),

ˆcijk + ˆcjki + ˆckij = 0.

ˆcijk + ˆcjki + ˆckij = 0 mod 3,

ˆcijk = ˆcjki = ˆckij = ±1.

so (11) can be false only when

ˆcijk = 1 is equivalent to

(i − j) =

(i + j − k) = ±1 and, therefore, also to

d
d
i = j ± 1 mod 3

,

k = −j mod 3,

and this cannot hold simultaneously for all the tree cyclic permutations of {ijk}. Replac-
ing i ↔ j, one obtains the same result for ˆcijk = −1. Therefore, the Jacobi identity holds
and the above algebra is indeed a Lie algebra (over the integers).

Let us consider the subalgebra

A∞ ≡ sp{Ti}i≥0.

An ≡ sp{Ti}0≤i≤n

Dividing by the ideal sp{Ti}i>n (for some positive integer n), one obtains the ﬁnite-
dimensional Lie algebra

with the Lie bracket

[Ti, Tj] =

(i − j)Ti+j
0

d

(

i + j ≤ n,
otherwise.

From now on we restrict our attention to such an algebra. It is a solvable algebra, T0 being
the only non-nilpotent generator and it possesses a ZZ-grading: deg(Ti) = i (inherited from
the original inﬁnite-dimensional algebra).

We would like to ﬁnd an invariant metric (·, ·) on An. Using (3), the invariance

condition

takes the form

([Tk, Ti], Tj) + (Ti, [Tk, Tj]) = 0

(here Ti ≡ 0 for i > 0) and, in particular, for k = 0:

d

d

(k − i)(Tk+i, Tj) +

(k − j)(Tk+j, Ti) = 0

d
which, by eqs. (7,8), is equivalent to

d

(i + j)(Ti, Tj) = 0.

This means that two out of each three “reversed” (right-up-to-left-down) diagonals vanish.
Let us look for a metric with only one non-vanishing diagonal. To obtain a non-degenerate
form, this must be the central diagonal and according to (17), this is possible only for
ˆn = 0. We, therefore, concentrate on this case and consider a metric of the form

(Ti, Tj) = ωjδi+j,n

,

ωn−j = ωj 6= 0.

For such a metric the invariance condition (15) takes the form

(k − i)ωj +

(k − j)ωi = 0,

∀i + j + k = n

and using ˆn = 0, one obtains

d

d

First we take ˆj = 0, which gives

d

d

(2i + j)ωj +

(2j + i)ωi = 0.

and this implies (since ˆ2 6= 0)

ˆi(ωi + ˆ2ωj) = 0,

ωi =

ωi = −ˆ2ω0 ˆi 6= 0,
ˆi = 0.
ωi = ω0

(i + j)ω0 = 0,

(21)

(22)

(23)

which is satisﬁed, since ˆ3 = 0. Also, since −ˆ2 = 1, we have ωi = ω0, ∀i. To summarize,
we proved the following.
Lemma:

d

A (non-degenerate) invariant metric on An with only one (reversed) diagonal
exists iﬀ ˆn = 0 and it is proportional to

(Ti, Tj) = δi+j−n.

(24)

Note that one can add to the metric a multiple of the Killing form, obtaining

(Ti, Tj) = δi+j−n + bδiδj

(25)

(with b arbitrary). The appearance of the second term can also be seen as a result of the
(automorphic) change of basis

T0 → T0 + 1

III The Ideals in An

In this section we continue to analyze the algebra An, looking for all its ideals and con-
cluding that, for ˆn = 0, the only ideals are of the form

Am,n ≡ sp{Ti}n

i=m.

This will be important later, when we will check if these algebras are double extensions of
Abelian algebras. The grading on An (deg(Ti) = i) will play a central role in the following
and will be called “charge”. The adjoint action of Ti increases the charge by i. Note that
there are only positive charges, so that the adjoint action cannot decrease the charge.
This proves that Am,n (for any m) is indeed an ideal.

Let J be an ideal in An. We choose a basis for J such that each element has a
diﬀerent minimal charge (this can be easily accomplished) and, therefore, can be labeled
by it. We, therefore, have (after an appropriate normalization)

J = sp{Sα},

Sα − Tα ∈ Aα+1,n.

Isolating in J the maximal ideal of the form Am,n, we obtain

J = sp{Sα}α∈A

Am,n

, m − 1 6∈ A.

M

Observe that this implies that for any element in J that is not in Am,n, its minimal charge
is in A.

The choice A = ∅ (the empty set) corresponds to the “trivial” solution J = Am,n. In
the following we look for other solutions, i.e., with A 6= ∅. This also implies max(A) <
m − 1. We are going to explore the restrictions on the Sα’s implied by the claim that J
is an ideal in An. Since Am,n is an ideal by itself, the only restrictions come from

[Ti, Sα] ∈ J

∀α ∈ A ,

i = 0, . . . , n.

(28)

J contains all terms with charge of at least m, therefore, restrictions will arise only in
terms in the commutator with smaller charge. For i ≥ m − α there are no such terms. As
the charge i decreases, there will be more non-trivial terms, therefore, we will start from
the higher charges.

For i = m − α − 1 we have (in the following, “≃” means “equality up to an element

of Am,n”):

[Tm−α−1, Sα] ≃ [Tm−α−1, Tα] =

(m − 2α − 1)Tm−1

(here and in other similar cases the hat should be applied to the whole expression between
d
parentheses). Tm−1 6∈ J (otherwise Am−1,n ⊂ J ), therefore,

Using eqs. (7,8), this is equivalent to

d

(m − 2α − 1) = 0.

ˆα = −

(2α) = −

(m − 1),

d

5

d

(26)

(27)

(29)

(30)

(31)

and since this is true for all α ∈ A, we also have

ˆα1 = ˆα2,

∀α1, α2 ∈ A.

(32)

Next, for i = m − α − 2 we have [using eqs. (31) and (7)]

[Tm−α−2, Sα] ≃ [Tm−α−2, Tα + sα+1

α Tα+1] = −Tm−2 + sα+1

α Tm−1.

(33)

This implies that m − 2 is a minimal charge of an element of J , therefore, m − 2 ∈ A.
Substituting α = m − 2 in (33), we obtain

[T0, Sm−2] ≃ −Tm−2 + sm−1

m−2Tm−1 ≃ −Sm−2 + 2sm−1

m−2Tm−1,

and this implies sm−1

m−2 = 0, so with no loss of generality, we can choose

Finally, for i = m − α − 3 and m − 2 > α ∈ A, we have

Sm−2 = Tm−2.

(34)

(35)

[Tm−α−3, Sα] ≃ [Tm−α−3, Tα + sα+1

α Tα+1 + sα+2

α Tα+2] = Tm−3 + sα+2

α Tm−1,

(36)

and as before this should imply that m − 3 ∈ A (being the minimal charge of an element
of J ). However, according to eq. (32), this is impossible since m − 2 ∈ A. Therefore, A
contains no elements other then m − 2 and J is of the form

J = sp{Tm−2} ⊕ Am,n.

(37)

A straightforward check [or use of eq. (31)] shows that this is indeed an ideal iﬀ ˆm = 0.
Is this ideal really non-trivial? It turns out that, for ˆn 6= 1 (including the case of
main interest to us: ˆn = 0), it is not! To see this, consider the (non-singular) linear map
deﬁned by Ti 7→ T ′
i ≡ −Ti+ˆi (note that for ˆn = 1 this is not well deﬁned). Since ˆm = 0,
this map transforms J to Am−1,n

[T ′

(i + j) = ˆi + ˆj], therefore,
[the second equality follows from the fact that for
this map is an automorphism of Lie algebras, which means that J = sp{Tm−2} ⊕ Am,n is
automorphic to Am−1,n.

IV Construction Methods of Self-Dual Lie Algebras

Our next goal is to show how the self-dual algebras described above (i.e., with ˆn = 0) ﬁt
into the general family of self-dual algebras, and to clarify their signiﬁcance. As noted in
the introduction, it has been proved [7] that any self-dual Lie algebra can be constructed,
using semi-simple and Abelian algebras, by a sequence of construction steps, each of which

6

is either an orthogonal direct sum (i.e., a direct sum equipped with the natural direct sum
metric) or a procedure called double extension [7]. This result seems, at ﬁrst sight, to make
all self-dual algebras available to us, but practically, this is not so, as we now explain.

The double extension of a self-dual Lie algebra A by another Lie algebra B (not neces-
sarily self-dual) can be seen as a two-step process (we will give here only the information
that will be needed later; more details can be found, for example, in [10]). The ﬁrst step
is to combine A and B to a semi-direct sum

S = B ⊂+A

(39)

(i.e., S is a direct sum of the vector spaces B and A, B is a subalgebra, and A is an ideal)
in such a way that the metric in A will be invariant also under the action of B. The
second step is the extension of S by an Abelian algebra B∗ with dim B∗ = dim B. The
resulting algebra D has a Lie product of the following general form:

A
A

[·, ·] B
B
B
A A A + B∗
B∗ B∗

0

B∗
B∗
0
0

(40)

For the ﬁrst step one needs, in addition to the algebras A and B, a representation of B as
derivations in A. Moreover, it was shown in [5] that if B acts through inner derivations
(i.e., the action of each y ∈ B coincides with the adjoint action of an element ˆy ∈ A:
y : x → [ˆy, x]), the resulting algebra D is decomposable (i.e., expressible as an orthogonal
direct sum). This means that for the construction of an indecomposable double extension,
one needs knowledge about the outer (non-inner) derivations in A, and such information
is not available in general. Therefore a discovery of unknown (indecomposable) self-dual
algebras is indeed signiﬁcant.

Another method for constructing new self-dual Lie algebras is by performing a Wigner
contraction [8] (this was proposed, in the context of string theory, in [9]). The initial data
for this construction consists of a self-dual Lie algebra S 0 and a subalgebra B0 of S 0
such that the restriction of the metric on S 0 to B0 is non-degenerate. Unlike in double
extensions, the initial data needed here is very simple and generally available (for example,
one can take S 0 and B0 to be simple), therefore, the method can be easily used to ﬁnd
many new non-trivial self-dual algebras.
It turns out, however [5], that the resulting
algebra is always a double extension of an Abelian algebra. Actually, when A (in the
process of double extension) is Abelian, the problem of the initial data described above
does not exist [12] and one can indeed construct large families of double extensions of
such algebras. Therefore the non-trivial task is to ﬁnd (indecomposable, self-dual) deeper
algebras (as they were called in [5]): algebras that their construction out of simple and
one-dimensional algebras involves more than one double extension [13]. In the next section
we show that almost all the algebras deﬁned in section II are such algebras.

7

V An as a Deeper algebra

In the previous section we described the following inclusion relations among the indecom-
posable self-dual algebras:

{ Indecomposable, Self-Dual Algebras }
∪
{ (Single) Double-Extensions of Abelian Algebras }
∪
{ Algebras obtainable by a Wigner contraction }.

The results of this section will imply that these are strict inclusions, i.e., all the three sets
are distinct. Explicitly we will show here that among the algebras An with ˆn = 0 (which
were shown in section II to be self-dual), A3 can be obtained by a Wigner contraction, A6 is
a double extension of an Abelian algebra but cannot be obtained by a Wigner contraction,
and the rest are deeper algebras, i.e. they are not double extensions of Abelian algebras
and, therefore, in particular, they cannot be obtained by a Wigner contraction.

First, from the list of the ideals found in section III we observe that An is indeed
indecomposable [14]. Next, we try to identify in An the structure of a double extension
of an Abelian algebra. The Lie product in an algebra D with such a structure is of the
form

[·, ·] B A B∗
B A B∗
B
A A B∗
0
B∗ B∗
0
0

In this table we recognize two properties of D:

1. D is a semi-direct sum of B and the ideal J = A + B∗: D = B ⊂+J ;

2. [J , J ] ⊂ B∗, therefore, dim[J , J ] ≤ dim B∗ = dim B.

Consider the ﬁrst property. The candidates for the ideal J were found in the previous
It was shown that J = Am,n (possibly after an automorphic change of basis
section.
{Ti}). Following the same approach, we choose a basis {Ri}m−1
for B such that i is the
i=0
minimal charge of Ri.
[Tm−1, Tm−2] = T2m−3 and 2m − 3 < n (since dimAn ≥ 2dimB),
therefore, [Rm−1, Rm−2] 6= 0 and its minimal charge is 2m − 3. B is closed under the Lie
bracket and B ∩ J = {0}, therefore, [Rm−1, Rm−2] 6∈ J , which implies that 2m − 3 < m.
This leaves us with m = 1 or 2 [15].

As for the second property, we have

One can easily verify that

dim[J , J ] ≤ dim B = m.

[Am,n, Am,n] = A2m+1,n,

8

(41)

(42)

(43)

therefore, eq. (42) implies n ≤ 3m. On the other hand, n + 1 ≥ 2m (since dim An ≥
2 dim B). Recalling that ˆn = 0, We obtain three possibilities:

(m, n) = (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 6),

(44)

and a direct check conﬁrms that each of them indeed corresponds to a double extension
of an Abelian algebra A (in the second possibility A is zero-dimensional). Observe that
there is more than one way to represent an algebra as a double extension. Moreover, A6
can be obtained both by extending an Abelian algebra (with m = 2) and by extending a
non-Abelian algebra (with m = 1), so the number of double extensions leading to a given
Lie algebra is not unique [16].

Turning to the search of the structure of a Wigner contraction, the only candidates
are those enumerated in (44). A3 is the Heisenberg algebra, and it is indeed a Wigner
contraction of so(2, 1) ⊕ so(2) [which leads to the ﬁrst possibility in (44)]. The other
candidate is A6, which corresponds to the last possibility in (44). To examine this case,
we use the further requirement that in a Wigner contraction, B must be self-dual [17].
For m = 2, B is the two-dimensional, non-Abelian Lie algebra,

[R0, R1] = R1.

This algebra is not self-dual, therefore, even if A6 can be obtained by a Wigner contraction,
this procedure will not lead to an invariant metric on A6.

VI Generalizations of the algebras An

We conclude with some comments about possible generalizations of the algebras deﬁned
in section II, obtained by using the deﬁning relations (5) with a diﬀerent choice of the map
“ ˆ ”. If one takes “ ˆ ” to be some homomorphism from ZZ to some commutative ring IF
with unity, (6-8) hold, as well as (11) and one obtains a Lie algebra over IF . For example,
one can take IF = ZZp (p a positive integer) with “ ˆ ” being the natural homomorphism
[18]. Another example is obtained by taking IF = ZZ and “ ˆ ” the identity map, the
result being the Virasoro algebra (with zero central charge). A diﬀerent approach would
be to keep IF = ZZ and to look for a map “ ˆ ” (not necessarily a homomorphism) with
the required properties. A natural candidate would be ˆi = i mod p (p a positive integer).
Taking p = 2 and ˆ : ZZ → {0, 1}, an analysis similar to the p = 3 case leads to the choice
(i, j, k) = (1, 0, 0), for which the right-hand side of (11) does not vanish (ˆcijk = ˆckij = 1,
ˆcjki = 0). There seems to be no other choice of p and range of the map “ ˆ ” such that the
multiplication is preserved.

In the previous sections we referred to the speciﬁc choice ˆi = i mod 3 ∈ {−1, 0, 1}, but
actually section II can be easily extended to a general commutative ring IF with unity
that has no zero-divisors and a general map “ ˆ ” satisfying properties (6-8) and the Jacobi
identity (11). The result is that the statement of the lemma is true whenever ˆ3 = 0, while
for ˆ3 6= 0 (and, in particular, for ˆi = i) there is no invariant metric with only one diagonal
[for ˆ2 = 0, (21) fails while for ˆ2, ˆ3 6= 0, (23) fails]. In most of section III the only additional

9

assumption used is ˆ3 = 0. Only the automorphism described at the end of the section
assumes the explicit form of “ ˆ ”.

We would like to thank A. Reznikov and J. Bernstein for helpful discussions.

[12] For Abelian A, any (non-trivial) linear map in A is obviously an outer derivation,
and to construct a double extension one only needs to worry about the invariance of
the metric (the second step of the construction is completely determined by the ﬁrst
one and poses no further diﬃculties).

[13] One might also consider a double extension of a reductive algebra A, i.e., an orthog-
onal direct sum of Abelian and semi-simple algebras. However, as shown in [5], the
semi-simple factor of A factorizes also in the result D (because a semi-simple algebra
does not have outer derivations), therefore, the result in this case is decomposable.

[14] This means [7] that they should be expressible as double extensions by the one-

dimensional algebra, and this structure can be indeed easily identiﬁed with:

B = sp{T0}

,

B∗ = sp{Tn}

, A = A1,n/B∗.

[15] The value m = 0 is also a possibility, but it is not interesting. It corresponds to
dim B = 0. As a double extension it means not to do anything – remaining with
the (Abelian) algebra A one started with. As a Wigner contraction it means that,
starting with some self-dual Lie algebra S 0, all we did is to set its Lie bracket to
0, so that we end up with the Abelian Lie algebra of the same dimension, which is
trivially self-dual. In the present context, this corresponds to the one-dimensional
algebra: D = A0.

[16] The notion of “depth” of a self-dual Lie algebra, suggested in [5], is still well de-
ﬁned, if one allows only extensions by either a simple- or a one-dimensional algebra.
Alternatively, the depth can be deﬁned as the minimal number of double extensions.

[17] More precisely, in a Wigner contraction (unlike double extension), the metric is not
involved at all in the construction of the algebra itself. However, the metric of the
initial algebra S0 is the source of the metric of the resulting algebra, and it turns
out (see, for example, the presentation in [10]) that if we want the ﬁnal metric to be
non-degenerate, B must be self-dual.

[18] This example, however, is irrelevant for string-theoretical models, since there one

needs an algebra over IR and for this IF must be some sub-ring of IR.

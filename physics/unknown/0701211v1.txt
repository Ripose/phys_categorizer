Fresnel  zone  plates  are  diffractive  elements  that  are  essential  to  form  images  in  many  scientific  and 
technological  areas,  especially  where  refractive  optics  is  not  available  [1-4].  One  of  the  main 
shortcomings  of  Fresnel  zone  plates,  which  limit  their  utility  with  broadband  sources,  is  their  high 
chromatic  aberration.  Recently  presented,  Fractal  Zone  Plates  (FZPs)  [5]  are  diffractive  lenses 
characterized  by  an  extended  focal  depth  with  a  fractal  structure.  This  behaviour  predicts  an  improved 
performance of FZPs as image forming devices with an extended depth of field and a reduced chromatic 
aberration. Here we report the achievement of the first polychromatic images obtained with a FZP that 
confirm these predictions. We show that the polychromatic modulation transfer function (MTF) of a FZP 
affected by defocus is about two times better than one corresponding to a Fresnel zone plate. This result 
opens the possibility to improve imaging techniques that use conventional Fresnel zone plates over a wide 
range of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from x-rays to THz. 

Since their introduction in 2003, FZPs have deserved the attention of several research groups working on 
diffractive optics [6-8], because it has been assumed that they can improve the performance of classical 
Fresnel  zone  plates  in  certain  applications  where  multiple  foci  are  needed.  FZPs  also  inspired  the 
invention  of  novel  photonic  structures  such  as  spiral  fractal  zone  plates  [8],  fractal  axicons  [9],  fractal 
conical  lenses  [10],  and  fractal  photon  sieves  [11].  In  spite  of  their  potential  applications  as  imaging 
elements, up to the present only the focusing properties of FZPs were considered in the literature. Here 
we  examine  the  incoherent  imaging  characteristics  of  these  elements  using  polychromatic  light  in  the 
visible range. The performance of FZPs is compared with conventional Fresnel zone plates of the same 
focal  distances.  We  discovered  that  the  FZP  provides  an  extended  depth  of  field  and  a  reduction  of 
chromatic  aberration.  This  finding  is  confirmed  objectively  using  the  modulation  transfer  function  as  a 
merit function.  

FZPs  can  be built using the same methods and technologies used for conventional Fresnel zone plates. 
Thus, we begin by tracing a parallelism in the design process between these two elements. As it is well 
known,  a  Fresnel  zone  plate  consists  of  alternately  transparent  and  opaque  zones  whose  radii  are 
proportional  to  the  square  root  of  the  natural  numbers.  Thus,  it  can  be  generated  starting  from  a  1-D 
compact-supported periodic function q((cid:57)) [see for example the binary function in Fig. 1(a)] followed by a 
change of coordinates (cid:57)=(r/a)2 , and then by rotating the transformed function around one of its extremes. 
The resulting radially symmetric 2-D structure is a Fresnel zone plate having a radial coordinate r and an 
outermost ring of external radius a [see Fig. 1(b)]. In a similar way a FZP can be constructed by replacing 
the periodic function q((cid:57)) by a function f((cid:57)) with fractal profile. In Fig 1 (c) we have represented the 1-D 
binary function associated to a member of the triadic Cantor set developed up to the third stage, S=3 [5]. 
The corresponding FZP is shown in Fig 1 (d). It is worth to mention that in the most general case any 1-D 
fractal can be employed to construct a FZP.  

A comparison between Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(c) shows that the minimum distance between the zones of the 
fractal binary function f((cid:57)) coincides with half period of the periodic function q((cid:57)). This distance defines 
the width of the outermost zones in the zone plates, (cid:39)r, and thus limits their ultimate spatial resolution. 
However,  as the focal length of a Fresnel zone plate is inversely proportional to the wavelength, when 
using  wideband  illumination,  its  longitudinal  chromatic  aberration  [see  Fig.  2(a)]  severely  limits  its 
imaging performance. We will see that FZPs can partially overcome this limitation.

where p(r) is the 2-D circularly symmetric pupil function that describes the zone plate in canonical polar 
coordinates. In Fig. 2 we represented the axial irradiances provided by a Fresnel and a fractal zone plates 
of the same focal length computed for three different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. As can be seen, 
the  principal  lobes  of  the  different  foci  provided  by  a  FZP  coincide  in  the  axial  position  with  those 
obtained  with  a  conventional  Fresnel  zone  plate,  but  the  FZP  produce  a  sequence  of  subsidiary  foci 
around  each  major  focus  following  the  fractal  structure  of  the  FZP  itself.  In  general,  the  position,  the 
intensity and the 3-D shape of the focal spot depend on the fractal level and on the lacunarity [12] of the 
encoded fractal function f((cid:57)). In all cases these subsidiary foci of the FZP provide an extended depth of 
focus for each wavelength that partially overlap with the other ones creating an overall extended depth of 
focus which is less sensitive to the chromatic aberration. 

We  have  experimentally  tested  the  imaging  capabilities  of  FZPs  under  white  light  illumination  and 
compared their performance against a conventional Fresnel zone plate of the same main focal distance. In 
our experiment we used a Fresnel zone plate with 81 zones and the equivalent FZP constructed using a 
triadic Cantor set developed up to stage S=4 [i.e. doubling the number of zones of the FZP in Fig.1(d)]. 
The diffractive lenses were printed and then photographically reduced onto 35mm slides resulting with a 
. In the 
radius a=2.52 mm and focal distance
experimental setup, a conventional object-lens-image plane arrangement, the test object consisted of a set 
of binary letters from an optotype-like chart, was illuminated using a polychromatic light source (Fiber 
optic illuminator, with a 150 W EKE 3220 K halogen lamp). The images were obtained directly onto the 
CMOS detector of a Cannon EOS 350D digital camera with 6.4 (cid:80)m square pixel size. In the experiment, 
the distance L between the object and the image plane was fixed to 575 mm and, to obtain the out of focus 
images,  the  distance  d from  the  object  plane  to  the  zone  plates  was  varied.  Accordingly,  the  defocus 
coefficient that affected the image at the output plane can be expressed as:

The results are summarized in Fig. 3. Due to the different transmittances of both kind of lenses the range 
of  intensities  of  the  photographs  in  this  figure  were normalized to the peak intensity, but no additional 
post-processing was performed. Defocused images obtained with the FZP show clear improvements when 
compared to those with Fresnel zone plate. The improvement is particularly noticeable with respect to the
chromatic  blur  which  is  considerable  lower  in  the  images  obtained  with  FZP,  even  at  the  focal  plane 
(however at this plane FZP provides a slightly poor resolution). As a result of the less sensitivity of FZP 
to the chromatic aberration the depth of field achieved with this plate is larger than the one obtained with 
Fresnel zone plate. In order to confirm the result of a subjective comparison, we compute the MTF values 
for the two lenses in the three experimental conditions. This computational modeling, shown in Fig. 4, 
accounts  for  the  wideband  illumination  (wavelengths  between  488  and  647  nm)  employed  in  the 
experiment. The polychromatic MTFs were computed as the superposition of three monochromatic MTF 
(using the same wavelengths as in Fig. 2) weighted by the spectral content of the illumination source and 
the spectral response of the detector. The results are plotted in Fig. 4. We found that the MTFs for the 
defocused planes is about 2 times better for FZP. Concretely, for the range of frequencies represented in 
Fig. 4 the ratio between the FZP and Fresnel zone plate MTFs has the following mean values: 2.41 for 
d=345  mm  (defocused  plane  away  from  the  lens);  0.46  at  the  focal  plane;  and  1.73  for  d=440  mm 
(defocused  plane  toward  the  lens).  The  improved  performance  of  FZPs  for  defocused  planes  is 
particularly evident at medium-high frequencies. 

We believe that the improved imaging capabilities (i.e. an increased in the depth of field and a reduction 
in the chromatic aberration), shown in Fig. 3 and supported by Fig. 4, that FZP offer in polychromatic 
imaging could be profited across a broad range of applications where conventional Fresnel zone plates are 
currently  applied  such  as  X-ray  microscopy  (where  narrow-band  sources  are  hardly  available);  THz 
imaging  and  tomography  (to  project  line  spots  onto  the  object  efficiently  [13]),  astronomy  [14]  and 
ophthalmology (in the form of intraocular or contact lenses). Moreover, because of the fact that FZP can 
be  produced  using  the  same  techniques  to  those  for  making  Fresnel  zone  plates  all  the  improvements

already reported for them, such as increasing the resolution by the overlay nanofabrication technique [15] 
or  by  the  use  of  composite  zones  [16];  are  still  valid  for  FZP  fabrication.  Interestingly,  in  FZP  design 
there is an additional parameter, the lacunarity of the fractal function, that adds versatility to the design 
process because it can modify the number of foci and their relative amplitude [12].

designing Fractal and Fresnel zone plates. It consists in 3 steps. (a) Fresnel zone plate starts from a binary 
1-D  compact  supported  function  q((cid:57))  .  After  the  change  of  variables (cid:57)=(r/a)2  .  The  resulting  function, 
which  is  periodic  in  the  new  coordinate,  is  rotated  around  the  origin.  The  result  is  the  zone  plate 
represented in b. (c) The originating function for the FZP is a fractal binary 1-D function f((cid:57)). In this case 
it  is  a  triadic  Cantor  set  for  stage  3  (see  Ref.  5  for  details).  (d)  The  change  of  variables  and  rotation 
performed to obtain b now results in a FZP.

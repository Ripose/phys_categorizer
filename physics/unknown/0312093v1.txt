is  presented 

We  consider  inverse  problems  related  to
velocity  reconstruction  in  electrically  conducting
fluids  from  externally  measured  magnetic  fields.
The  underlying 
the
framework  of  the  integral  equation  approach  to
homogeneous  dynamos  in  finite  domains,  which
can  be  cast  into  a  linear  inverse  problem  in  case
that the magnetic Reynolds number of the flow is
not too large. Some mathematical problems of the
inversion, including the uniqueness problem in the
sphere  and  a  paradigmatic  isospectrality  problem
for  mean-field  dynamos,  are  touched  upon.  For
practical  purposes,  the  inversion  is  carried  out
with  the  help  of  Tikhonov  regularization  using  a
quadratic  functional  of  the  velocity  as  penalty
function.  For  the  first  time,  we  present  results  of
an  experiment  in  which  the  three-dimensional
velocity field of a propeller driven flow in a liquid
metal  is  reconstructed  by  a  contactless  inductive
measuring technique.

INTRODUCTION

The determination of flow velocities in opaque
fluids is a notorious problem in various industrial
applications  as,  e.g.,  metallurgy  and  crystal
growth. One important example is the continuous
casting of steel for which one would like to have a
rough picture of the actual flow pattern in order to
react in case of irregularities. Another example is
the  Czochralski  crystal  growth  technique  for
Silicon  monocrystals  for  which  some  monitoring
of  the  flow  structure  would  be  highly  desirable.
Needless  to  say  that  the  usual  optical  flow
techniques,  as  Laser  Doppler

cases.  Actually,  there  are  a  few  measurement

or 

However,  for  hot  and/or  chemically  aggressive
materials it would be most desirable to avoid any
contact with the melt.

This  wish  also  applies  to  a  particular  sort  of
liquid  sodium  experiments  which  have  been
carried  out  since  1999  in  order  to  investigate  the
homogeneous  dynamo  effect  which  is  at  the  root
of  planetary,  stellar,  and  galactic  magnetism  [2].
A  contactless  method  to  infer  the  sodium  flow
velocity  from  the  externally  measured  magnetic
fields would be of high value for the study of the
saturated regime of those dynamos.

With  view  on  these  possible  applications,  the
paper  is  intended  to  facilitate  the  use  of  a
contactless  inductive  method  for  the  velocity
determination  in  electrically  conducting  melts,
based on external magnetic field measurements. A
clear  shortcoming  of  the  method,  in  comparison

this  point  might  be
outweighed  by  the  fact  that  the  method  enables

in the order of one second. This feature makes the
method  attractive  for  a  number  of  technological
and research applications.

The  structure  of  the  paper  is  as  follows:  We
start with the  theoretical  set-up  in  the  form  of  an
integral  equation  system  for  the  magnetic  field
and the electric potential that both are influenced
(or even self-excited) by the velocity field. Then,
the general form will be simplified for the case of
small  magnetic  Reynolds  numbers.  The  inverse

externally  measured  magnetic  fields  will  be
formulated.

Two  short  excursions  will  be  put  in,  the  first
one  dealing  with  the  uniqueness  problem  for  the
general  velocity  reconstruction,  the  second  one
sketching an inverse spectral dynamo problem for
a helical turbulence parameter.

Then we will switch over from pure theory to
a  laboratory  experiment.  Actually,  this  is  a  non-
trivial  step  since  the  reliable  determination  of
rather  small  induced  magnetic  fields  on  the
background  of  large  applied  magnetic  fields
presents  a  serious  problem  for  the  measurement
technique,  at  least,  if  one  needs  simultaneously
magnetic  field  data  at  some  dozens  of  sites  at  an
affordable  prize.  In  concrete,  we  present  first
results  of  an  experiment  with  a  propeller  driven
flow  in  a  liquid  metallic  alloy  that  is  exposed
subsequently  to  two  different  external  magnetic
fields.  For  both  applied  magnetic  fields,  the
induced  magnetic  fields  are  measured  at  49  sites
outside the fluid. From these two sets of data, the
velocity  field  is  derived  by  inversion.  Although
the reconstructed velocity structure is only rough,
it  reflects  the  essential  characteristics  of  the  flow
quite realistically.

The  paper  closes  with  some  conclusions  and

some ideas for future work.

BASIC THEORY

moving  with  the  velocity  u ,  comes  under  the
influence  of  an  imposed  steady  magnetic  field

For  some  applications  it  is  useful  to  switch
over from the differential equation formulation to
the  integral  equation  formulation,  which  starts
also  from  Eq.  (2)  and  utilizes  Biot-Savart’s  law
for the magnetic field and Green’s theorem for the
electric  potential  [3,4].  In  the  following,  we  will
only need the version for the steady case, in which
the electric field can be expressed by the gradient

In  Eq.  (4)  we  see  that  the  induced  magnetic

(5)  are  valid  for  arbitrary  values  of  Rm .  For
small  Rm ,  however,  the  induced  magnetic  field
b  under the volume integrals on the r.h.s. of Eqs.
(4)  and  (5)  can  be  neglected  and  the  total  B can
be replaced by 0B .

In [6] we had shown that the velocity structure
of the flow can be reconstructed from the external
measurement of an appropriate  component  of  the
induced magnetic field (e.g., the radial component
for  a  spherically  shaped  fluid  volume)  and  the
induced  electric  potential  at  the  fluid  boundary.
There  remains  a  non-uniqueness  concerning  the
radial  distribution  of  the  flow  [7]  what  can  be
made  plausible  by  representing  the  fluid  velocity
by  two  scalars  living  in  the  whole  fluid  volume
(e.g.,  the  toroidal  and  poloidal  parts).  Then  it  is
clear  that  two  quantities  measured  on  a  two-
dimensional covering of the fluid give not enough
information  for  the  reconstruction  of  the  two
desired 3D-quantities.

In  [8]  we  had  developed  a  general  method  to
avoid  the  electric  potential  measurement  at  the
fluid  boundary.  The  main  idea  is  to  apply  the
external  magnetic  field  in  two  different,  e.g.
orthogonal,  directions  and 
to  measure  both
corresponding  sets  of  induced  magnetic  fields.
The  main  obstacle  for  the  application  of  this
method  comes  from  the  electric  potential  term  at
the  surface,  the  measurement  of  which  we  would
like to circumvent. For the very special case of a
spherical fluid volume, it can easily be seen, from
multiplying Eq. (4) with the radial unit vector, that
the  radial  component  of  b   is  unaffected  by  f .
For  other  than  spherical  fluids,  however,  there  is
always  an  influence  of  the  surface  term  on  b .
How can the influence of f  be taken into account
without measuring it?

In the following we sketch the solution of this
puzzle.  Assume  all  measured  induced  magnetic
field  components  be  collected  into  an  NB -
dimensional  vector  with  the  entries 
ib .  Assume
further  a  certain  discretization  of  the  electric
potential  at  the  surface,  denoted  by  an  NP -
dimensional  vector  with  the  entries 
mf .  The
velocity  in  the  domain  D   is  discretized  as  an
ku .

UNIQUENESS CONSIDERATIONS

Having established, in Eq. (9), a linear relation
between 
the
the  desired  velocity  field  and 
measured magnetic fields, we can try to solve the
inverse  problem.  The  above  mentioned  non-
uniqueness  with  regard  to  the  depth  dependence
of  the  velocity  can  only  be  resolved  by  using
applied magnetic fields with varying frequency.

Even  then  the  problem  arises  whether  the
depth  dependence  of  the  velocity  field  can  be
recovered  uniquely  from  a  large  enough  set  of
frequency  dependent  data.  In  a  first  attempt  to
solve 
this  problem  we  have  considered  a
simplified  dynamo  problem  in  which  the  large-

i.e.,  the  mean  squared  residual  in  dependence  on

between the fit of the model to the measured data

radial  dependence  of  a   from  a  given  set  of
eigenvalues  of  a  matrix  eigenvalue  equation  for
the  defining  scalars  of  the  magnetic  field.  This
inverse  spectral  problem  has  been  tackled  both
numerically  [9]  and  analytically  [10].  Still,  the
results  are  not  completely  conclusive,  but  it  is
clear that the use of data with varying frequencies
could mitigate the non-uniqueness of the inversion
with  respect  to  the  depth  dependence  of  the
velocity. A nice byproduct of the numerical work,
which  uses  an  evolution  strategy,  was 
the

Figure  1  shows  the  experimental  set-up.  We
use  4.4  liters  of  the  eutectic  alloy  Ga67In20.5Sn12.5

and electrical conductivity at  20°C  are  6.36 · 103

is  produced  by  a  motor  driven  propeller  with  a
diameter  of  6  cm  inside  a  polypropylene  vessel
with  18.0  cm  diameter.  The  height  of  the  liquid
metal is 17.2 cm, giving an aspect ratio close to 1.
The  propeller  can  rotate  in  both  directions,
resulting either in upward or downward pumping.

first, the propeller itself has a preferred direction.
At  second,  it  is  positioned  approximately  at  one

upward  pumping  they  remove  the  downstream
swirl thus leaving the entire flow rather swirl-free.
Hence,  the  downward  pumping  produces,  in
addition  to  the  main  poloidal  roll,  a  considerable
toroidal  motion,  too.  For  the  upward  pumping,
this toroidal motion is, to a large extend, inhibited
by  the  guiding  blades.  It  was  one  of  the  tasks  of
the experiment to discriminate between those flow
structures.

and that we neglect this term.

Figures  6  and  7  show  the  results  of  the
inversion.  In  Fig.  6,  we  see  clearly  the  upward
flow in the center of the vessel and the downward
flow at the rim, but nearly no rotation of the flow.
In Fig. 7 we see the downward flow together with
a  clear  rotation  of  the  flow.  This  absence  and
presence of the swirl is an important feature which
can evidently be discriminated by our method.

It is worth to note that not only the structure of
the flow, but also the range of the velocity scale is
correctly reproduced by the inversion.

We  have  restricted  our  inversion  to 
the
determination  of  the  velocity  at  only  45  points.
Considering  only  two  components  at  every  point
as  independent  (the  third  can  be  fixed  by  the
divergence-free  constraint)  we  end  up  with  90
degrees  of  freedom  which  are  to  be  determined
from  2 · 49=96  measured  data.  Having  more
information than wanted quantities, we could get a
reasonable result even without regularization. This
is seen by the fact that in Fig. 5 the Tikhonov‘s L-
curves  are  stuck  at  the  r.h.s.  without  decreasing
down  to  a  zero  mean  squared  residual.  This
decrease  would  happen  for  a  larger  number  of
wanted velocity degrees of freedom.

Fig.  5:  Tikhonov’s  L-curve  for  the  two  different
pumping  directions.  Top:  upward  pumping.
Below:  downward  pumping.  The  arrow  points  at
the bended knee where the curve has the strongest
curvature.  At  this  point  we  get  a  reasonable
estimate  of  the  velocity.  The  rms  of  these
velocities is approximately 0.5 m/s for the upward
pumping and 0.4 m/s for the downward pumping.

and 

Even  at  the  present  level  of  data  acquisition,
without  imposing  magnetic  fields  with  varying
frequencies,  there  is  room  for  improvements  of
the  inversion  scheme.  For  example,  one  could
represent  from  the  very  beginning  the  velocity
components  by  a  finite  number  of  smooth
functions

coefficients  in  the  inversion.  At  least,  this  would
significantly  improve  the  appearances  of  the
resulting  velocity  field,  if  compared  to  the  rough
point-wise  vector  representation  used  in  this
paper.  However,  even  with  apparently  smooth
velocity  fields  one  should  not  forget  that  the
number  of  reliable  degrees  of  freedom  cannot  be
larger than the number of the measured degrees of
freedom.

Conclusions and Prospects

for 

those 

Flow  measurement  based  on  induced  electric
potentials  has  a  long  tradition  and  a  lot  of
practical  applications  [13].  The  change  from
induced  electric  potentials  to  induced  magnetic
fields  allows  a  completely  contactless  measuring
technique 
flows  whose  magnetic
Reynolds  number  is  not  too  small.  In  a  liquid
metal  experiment,  we  have  put  into  practice  the
theory  of  3D  velocity 
from
externally measured magnetic fields that had been
developed  by  us  during  the  last  years.  The
challenges  for  the  future  lay  with  improving  the
depth resolution of the method by using magnetic
fields  with  variable  frequency  on  one  hand,  and
with  the  extension  of  the  method  to  inverse
dynamo  problems  with  larger  magnetic  Reynolds
numbers, on the other hand.

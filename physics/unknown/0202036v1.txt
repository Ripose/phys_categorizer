operated  at  constant  voltage  supply  are  presented  in  this  article.  It  is  shown  that  the 

detector's performance is stable, and its spatial resolution D x b

The  discovery  of  the  phenomenon  of  controllable  drift  and  multiplication  of 

electrons in porous dielectrics under the influence of external electric field [1-5] allowed 

us to create a new class of radiation detectors – porous detectors (PD). Porous emission 

detectors  had  been  designed  first,  in  which  the  primary-particle-induced  secondary 

electrons after their multiplication within the same emitter escaped into vacuum and were 

detected. The secondary emission factor of porous emitter was 250 in case of passage of 

minimum  ionizing  particles  [6],  and  several  tousands  in  case  of  a -particle,  when  its 

energy loss was ~2-3 MeV [7, 8-11]. For more details see Lorikyan's review [12].  

Porous detectors are representing a new radiation detection technology. The rise 

time and pulse width in such detectors is less than 1 ns and 2 ns, and the time and spatial 

resolution is 60 ps and 250 m m, respectively [13, 14]. These detectors are operated in a 

vacuum  of  b

  10-2  Torr,  have  little  quantity  of  matter  (5· 10-4  g/cm2),  and  are  highly 

efficient  at detecting charged particles and  soft X-rays.  Such properties  allow PD to be 

used in accelerator experiments, time-of-flight measurements, for detection of soft X-rays 

in space, and X-ray imaging in medicine.  

The  PDs work as follows:  the ionization  electrons (d -electrons) produced  in the 

walls  of  pores  by  the  incident  ionizing  radiation  are  accelerated  in  the  pores  by  the 

applied electric field. These electrons produce secondary emission electrons in the walls 

of other pores, which are in their turn accelerated in the pores, emitting new secondary 

electrons.  This  process  occurs  with  all  generations  of  secondary  electrons  and  an 

avalanche  multiplication of electrons  is taking place in the porous  medium  with  a high 

gain factor.

Although  there  is  currently  no  qualitative  theory  of  electrons  drift  and 

multiplication in porous media, one can conjecture that high s

 is due to the fact, that the 

electron affinity of the pore material drops down to negative values, as a result of which 

the  electrons  are  easily  escaping  from  bottom  of  conduction  band  into  vacuum.  Also, 

electrons are escaping from regions deeper behind the surface of pore walls. So, the share 

of  electrons  produced  by  initial  particles  and  secondary  electrons  taking  part  in  the 

process of electron drift and multiplication becomes larger.  

 

In earlier studies of multiwire porous detectors (MPD) [12-14, 15-18, 19-21] we 

observed  that  the  radiation  detection  efficiency  was  rapidly  decreasing  with  time.  To 

ensure  stable  performance  of  detectors,  we had  to operate  them  in  the  mode  of  pulsed 

voltage supply [22] – narrow (2-5 ms) working voltage pulses alternating with wide (18-

15  ms)  depolarizing  voltage  pulses.  Analysis  of  the  foregoing  results  shows  that 

polarization effects are arising due to the impurities that are present in the porous material 

[23].  

 

The present study was conducted for MPD with CsI of 99,98 % purity. MPD was 

assembled under as clean technological conditions as possible. 

The schematic view of MPD is shown in Fig.1. 

Anode wires 1 with diameter 25 m m are stretched across the surface of fiberglass 

laminate  frame  2.  Porous  CsI  layer  6  is  first  deposited  on  aluminum  cathode  4  of 

thickness  65  m m,  then  the  frame  with  anode  wires  on  it  and  frame  5  with  the  cathode 

fastened on it are strained against each other. Frame 3 is for setting the detector’s gap.  

 

3

The MPD being used had a gap of 0,5 mm and a sensitive area of 22,0· 22,0 mm2. 

The  anode  wires  were  spaced  at  0,25  mm.  The  thickness  of  deposited  CsI  layer  was 

0,75mm, i.e. the anode wires were buried in the porous layer.  

Porous  CsI  was  prepared  by  means  of  thermal  deposition  in  an  Ar  atmosphere 

[40]. The CsI layer had a density of 34 ·

 10-2 g/cm3. The measurements were taken under 

(7-9)· 10-3  Torr  vacuum.  The  X-rays  incident  through  the  cathode  had 5,9  KeV energy 

and 63 s-1 intensity, while a -particles getting in from the side of anode wires had 5 MeV 

energy and 48 s-1 intensity. In all cases, the errors are taken to be statistical and are not 

indicated. The pulse registration threshold was 35 mV.  

For estimation of coordinate resolution, the MPD's anode wires were grouped into 

two groups. The first group included odd-numbered anode wires, and the second group 

included the even-numbered anode wires. Anode wires in each group were connected to 

the  inputs  of  fast  current  aplifiers  having  a  conversion  ratio  of  30  mV/m A.  After 

amplification, the signals from the first group, N(I), and second group, N(II), were shaped 

and counted.  Signals  from  shaped pulses  were  also  counted.  Ncc  indicate  that  the same 

particle was detected by both groups, i.e., by two neighboring anodes. It is obvious that 

the ratio of Ncc to the total number of detected particles is determined by the coordinate 

resolution of MPD.  

The  studies have shown  that when  the  voltage to  MPD  was applied in less than 

some  time  T  after  deposition  of  the  CsI  layer,  both  anode  groups  were  registering  all 

particles simultaneously, which means that the same particle had been registered by two 

neighboring  anode  wires  simultaneously,  i.e.  MPD’s  spatial  resolution  was  worse  than 

the  spacing  between  the  anode  wires,  and  the  registration  efficiency  h   was  decreasing

with  time.  But  when  the  MPD  was  turned on  in  time  T  after  deposition  of  the porous 

layer, one could see a completely different picture: the MPD had a good spatial resolution 

and  its  performance  was  stable  in  time.  The  investigations  have  shown  that  for  MPD 

having porous CsI with r  »  0,4%, T is 7 hours and for r  »  0,7% T = 5 hours.  

Fig.2 shows the dependence of  the  number of  a -particles registered by  the  first 

group Na (I) (crosses), second group Na (II) (points), both groups Ncc (triangles) and only 

one  group Na (I)  -  Ncc/2  (squares)  of  anode  wires  on  voltage,  which  was  observed  in 5 

hours after MPD was assembled. The curve with triangles represents the number of cases 

when the same a -particle is registered by two groups of anode wires (Ncc).  

One can see, that all the curves are forming a plateau, and, within the errors, each 

group  of  anode  wires  has  counted  the  same  number  of  a -particles,  and  the  number  of 

coincidence pulses Ncc is very small compared with the number of a -particles registered 

by both groups of anode wires (»

 3%), i.e. the spatial resolution of MPD is less than the 

spacing between the anode wires, i.e. better than –

 125 m m. Deterioration of coordinate 

resolution due to the parallax effect was < 60 m m on the average. In this case, the total 

number of registered particles Na =N(I)+N(II)–Ncc. 

 

Fig. 3 shows the time-stability of Na (I) (crosses), Na (II) (points), Ncc (triangles), 

and the number of  a -particles detected by  only  one group  of anode  wires Nx(I) - Ncc/2 

(squares)  measured  at  U=1538  V,  right  after  measuring  the  dependence  presented  in 

Fig.2. It is obvious, that the time-stability of MPD is high. Later on, the same MPD was 

operated 6 days, for 15 hours a day, being turned off for the remaining 9 hours of the day. 

Analogous  data  were  obtained.  The  detection  efficiency  sometimes  dropped  by  about 

10%,  which  was  easily  recovered  by  adjustment  of  the  voltage.  Similar  results  were 

 

5

obtained with  the anode  wires spaced at 125 m m,  i.e.  the MPD’s spatial resolution  was 

better than –

 60 m m.  

 

The  results  of  15-hour  time-stability  measurements  carried  out on  the  sixth day 

are presented in Fig.4. The symbols used are the same as in all Figures. In the beginning 

of  the  measurements  U=1400  V,  but  in  three hours  of  operation  the  voltage  was set  at 

1438  V.  This  Figure  shows  that  on  the  first  day  of  measurements  h   and  Ncc  remained 

unchanged within the errors.  

Upon finishing the measurements, the detector was disassembled. Examination of 

MPD revealed no changes in the CsI layer, which means, that the MPD could have been 

still operable.  

Analogous measurements were conducted with X-rays. 

Fig.5 shows the results of the measurement of the dependence of the number of 

X-quanta  registered  by  the  first  group  Nx(I),  (crosses),  second  Nx(II),  (points),  both 

groups Ncc  (triangles)  and  by  only  one  group  Nx(I)  -  Ncc/2  (squares) of  anode  wires  on 

voltage.  Measurements  were  conducted  in  5  hours  after  deposition  of  CsI  layer.  The 

results of the same kind of measurements conducted on the third day are shown in Fig.6 

(no  measurements  on  the  second  day).  No  curves  for  Ncc  are  presented  for  this  case, 

because Ncc  is small,  comprising 0,7% of Nx  = Nx(I)+Nx(II) - Ncc.  Note, that Ncc  is  in  a 

strong  dependence  on  the  quality  of  MPD  assembly  and  CsI  deposition. The  results  of 

time-stability  measurements  carried  out  for  14  days  are  presented  in  Fig.7,  where  the 

number of days is laid off along the X-axis, and the average number of Nx per day is laid 

off along the Y-axis. On the second, fourth and ninth days the MPD was off. The values 

of U on the given day are shown on the plot. As is seen in Fig.7, the X-ray registration

efficiency  decreased  by  about  30  %  on  the  third  day  of  measurements  then  remained 

constant at this level within the errors. The slight increase of h

 after the tenth day is more 

likely due to incorrect adjustment of voltage U.  Ncc did not practically change over the 

whole period of the measurements.

Abstract

The  main  linacs  of  the  Next  Linear  Collider  (NLC)  will
contain  several 
thousand  X-band  RDDS  (Rounded
Damped  Detuned  Structures).    The  transverse  wakefield
in  the  structures  is  reduced  by  detuning  the  modal
frequencies  such  that  they  destructively  interfere  and  by
four damping manifolds per structure which provide weak
damping. Errors in  the  fabrication  of  the  individual  cells
and  in  the  alignment  of  the  cells  will  reduce  the
cancellation  of  the  modes.    Here,  we  calculate  the
tolerances  on 
the  synchronous
frequencies of the cells and the cell-to-cell alignment.

2. MACHINING ERRORS AND

EMITTANCE DILUTION

Small  dimensional  errors,  generated  when  fabricating
the irises and cavities of an accelerator structure, give rise
to errors in the synchronous frequencies [1]. Presently, it
is  possible  to  machine  the  cells  to  an  accuracy  of  better
than  1  m m  [2,3],  however,  when  fabricating  several
thousand such structures, looser tolerances may reduce the
fabrication costs.

The linacs consist of roughly 5000, nominally identical,
structures,  each  of  which  contains  206  slightly  different
cells.  The  nomenclature  that  we  adopt  is  an  error  type
which is repeated in every cell of a structure but differs in
every  structure  is  referred  to  as:  a  systematic-random
error.    Whereas,  an  error  that  is  repeated  in  every
structure,  but  varies  from  cell-to-cell,  we  refer  to  as  a
random-systematic  error.    We  also  consider  random-
random  and  systematic-systematic  (potentially  the  most
damaging)  error  types  making  a  total  of  4  error  types.
The random errors we consider have an RMS deviation of
3MHz about the mean dipole frequency of the cells.   In
fabricating  RDDS1,  the  RMS  error  in  the  synchronous
frequency  prior  to  bonding  the  cells  was  0.5MHz  [2,3]
and thus simulation of larger errors is pursued with a goal
of  understanding  how  much  the  cell-to-cell  fabrication
tolerances can be relaxed.
    Cell-to-cell  frequency  errors  within  an 
individual
structure reduce the effect of the detuning cause a larger
wakefield.      Although  BBU  is  a  complicated  effect,  an
indicator  for  the  onset  of  BBU  is  provided  by  the

1.  INTRODUCTION

In  order  to  answer  fundamental  questions  posed  by
particle physics a high-energy e+-e- linear collider is being
designed at SLAC and KEK with an initial center-of-mass
energy of 500 GeV and the possibility of a later upgrades
to 1.0 TeV or 1.5 TeV.  The heart of the collider consists
of two linear accelerators constructed from approximately
10,000 X-band accelerating structures.  These linacs will
accelerate  a  multi-bunch  particle  beam  from  8GeV  to
500GeV.  Each accelerating structure consists of 206 cells
(two  of  which  are  shown  in  Fig.  1)  which  are  bonded
together.        A  displacement  of  the  beam  in  the  structure
gives  rise  to  a  transverse  deflecting  force,  or  wakefield.
There  are  two  effects  that  are  of  concern:  first,  the
transverse  wakefield  can  cause  a  multi-bunch  beam
breakup instability (BBU) which would make the collider

wakefield  at  a  particular  bunch  which  is  formed  by
summing  all  wakefields  left  behind  by  earlier  bunches
which  is  denoted  as  the  “sum  wakefield”  [4].  BBU  will
likely arise when the RMS of the sum wake is the order of
1  V/pC/mm/m  or  larger.    When  not  in  the  BBU  regime,
the  sum  wakefield  also  provides  an  accurate  method  of
calculating the multi-bunch emittance dilution and will be
used in the following section.

phase space at the end  of  the  linac  corresponding  to  this
random-systematic error is plotted in Fig. 4(b).

The results of relaxing the tolerance are documented in
[6] and it is found that even for the very relaxed case of a
5MHz error in the synchronous frequencies BBU does not
occur and little emittance growth arises provided this cell-
to-cell error is not repeatable over all structures.

An example of the sum wakefield for  a  structure  with
3MHz RMS errors in the cell synchronous frequencies is
plotted  in  Fig.  2  versus  a  change  in  the  bunch  spacing.
Changing the bunch spacing is equivalent to changing all
the 
systematically.  The
wakefield with the random errors is an order of magnitude
larger  than  in  a  perfect  structure  and  if  these  cell  errors
are reproduced in every structure it would be expected to
cause significant BBU.

This is confirmed by particle tracking simulations using
the code LIAR [5] in which the all structures are assumed
to be perfectly aligned and the beam is initially offset by
1m m.      When  all  structures  have  identical  random  errors
 is of
(this is the case of random-systematic errors) and Ss
the  order  of  unity,  the  beam  clearly  undergoes  BBU  as
illustrated  in  Fig.  3  and  the  emittance  grows  by  roughly
250%. This is supported by looking at the phase space at
the end of the linac which which is plotted in Fig. 4 (a). In
contrast, if the cell errors in every structure are different,
the  random-random  case,  BBU  does  not  occur  and  the
emittance growth is negligible as is also seen in Fig. 3.

systematic  error  in  the  synchronous  frequencies  of  the
cells and this is investigated by varying the spacing of the
bunches  in  the  train  of  particles.    The  case  of  a
systematic-systematic  error,  corresponding  to  an  error  in
all  of  the  cell  frequencies  that  is  repeated  in  all  of  the
structures,  is  studied  by  choosing  a  particular  bunch
spacing that results in a peak in the sum wakefield. Such
an error also leads to BBU.   However, imposing a small
random  error  (3MHz  was  utilised)  from  structure-to-
structure prevents the resonant growth from occurring; the

3. TOLERANCES IMPOSED ON

STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT

Next, assuming that BBU is not an issue, let us consider
the effect of misalignments of the cells and the structures
on the multi-bunch beam emittance.  In order to estimate
the  growth  of  the  projected  emittance  De   of  a  train  of
bunches caused by misaligned structure cells we uses the
following formula for the expectation value of De [5]

4. CONCLUSIONS

from  structure-to-structure  and  hence  BBU 

We  have  discussed  four  distributions  of  frequency
errors.    BBU  will  arise  in  the  NLC  from  cell  frequency
errors  of  many  MHz  which  are  repeated  in  every
structure.    However,  in  practise  it  is  expected  that
fabrication  errors  will  occur  randomly  from  cell-to-cell
is
and 
unlikely  to  occur.    Furthermore,  to  meet  a  prescribed
multi-bunch  emittance  growth  of  10%,  the  cells  in  the
present RRDS structure design structure must  be  aligned
to  better  than  6m m  and  the  average  alignment  of  the
structure  must  be  better  than  40m m.    Of  course,  the
average alignment tolerance is dominated by single bunch
tolerances and must be closer to 10m m[8].

Figure  5:  Percentage  emittance  growth  down  the  linac
calculated  with  the  tracking  code  LIAR  for  complete
structures  which  are  individually  offset  in  a  random
manner.  The RMS offset of the structures is 40m m.

In  order  to  verify  Eq.  (3.1),  we  tracked  a  multi-bunch
beam through the complete linac (approx 11km) using the
computer  code  LIAR  [4]  for  RDDS1  with  the  following
linac  parameters:  beam  final  energy  -  Ef=500  GeV,
number of structures in the linac – Ns = 4720, and number
of particles in the bunch – N =1.1 x1010. The multi-bunch
emittance  growth  which  arises  with  structures  rigidly
misaligned is shown in Fig. 5.  It is evident that structures
randomly  misaligned  with  an  RMS  value  of  40m m  gives
rise to an overall emittance growth of 10% which  grows
linearly along the linac as predicted by Eq. (3.1).

The result of many simulations in which each structure
is  divided  up  into  groups  of  cells  and  each  individual
group  is  moved  randomly  transverse  to  the  axis  of  the
linac is illustrated in Fig. 6.  It is seen that the analytical
formula  based  on  the  sum  wakefield  (line)  generally

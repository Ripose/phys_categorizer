A silicon field emitter neutraliser is under development at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Thin layers of insulating materials as coatings for the gated field emitter array structure are described, which are postulated to reduce power consumption and reduce overheating. The power consumption and lifetime of aluminium nitride and amorphous hydrogenated diamond-like carbon coatings have been tested by current-voltage and endurance tests. Diamond-like carbon coatings were promising, performing better in endurance tests than uncoated samples, but further work is required to characterise the coating’s physical properties and its effects on field emission. The thermal conductivity of the coating material appeared to have little effect on the sample lifetimes. Aluminium nitride had reduced power consumption compared to diamond-like carbon coated and uncoated samples. A thin (~5 nm) layer was optimal, meeting European Space Agency specifications for the neutraliser engineering model.   Keywords  Fundamental physics, field emission, electric propulsion, ion propulsion  1 Introduction  Tests of fundamental physics in space use the ultra-quiet environment of a free falling spacecraft. A satellite in free fall experiences only differential gravitational forces; the spacecraft is also remote from sources of gravitational disturbance such as large moving masses. However non-gravitational disturbances, like drag from the residual atmosphere in low Earth orbit, or solar radiation pressure during heliospheric missions, can still influence measurements at the highest precision. In order to achieve the pico-gravity environment required for fundamental physics missions a disturbance compensation system is used, often described as drag free control. In drag free systems micro-propulsion thrusters, providing thrust in the µ−mN range, are used to control the satellite’s station keeping. In the European context, the preferred micro thrusters are field effect electric propulsion devices or FEEPs. FEEPs use field emission to extract ions from a liquid metal, such as caesium or indium,                                                 1 Presently at Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, Surrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7XH, UK  2which are then ejected at high velocity (e.g. Tajmar et al, 2004). The ion emission causes the spacecraft to quickly become charged to very high potentials which reduces thrust efficiency, eventually to zero, and may result in damage to spacecraft systems by the return ion flux (Aplin and Tarakanov, 2004).   To return the spacecraft to charge neutrality an electron source, a neutraliser, is necessary. For the Lisa Pathfinder mission, a single neutraliser serving a cluster of 4 FEEP thrusters maximises system power usage and reduces complexity. The neutraliser must provide an electron current at least equal to the maximum current from four FEEP thrusters; for LISA Pathfinder this is 6mA. The neutraliser power allocation for LISA Pathfinder is 0.2W/mA, which dictates the use of a cold emission mechanism such as field emission as the electron source, implying a maximum voltage of 200V at 6mA. The combination of these requirements, and an additional specification to keep the neutraliser mass below 100g, effectively restricts the production technology to micro-fabrication. This resulted in the choice of gated silicon tip field emitter technology for the neutraliser system, due to its high current density per unit mass and low power operation (Aplin et al, 2004). This paper discusses the development of one aspect of the neutraliser system, the use of a coating to protect the neutraliser structure and improve performance. In the next section, the special requirements for using field emitters as part of fundamental physics missions in space will be briefly described. Section 3 summarises the field emitter fabrication and test apparatus used in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) test programme. In Section 4, the basis for using coatings to improve field emitter performance is introduced, and the RAL tests on coated field emitter arrays discussed in Section 5.  2 Design and operating conditions for field emitters for use in space  Much previous research into field emitters has focused on developing them for commercial applications such as flat screen displays. Whilst field emitters can generally perform well in the laboratory, some special considerations are needed when developing a device intended for use in the harsher environment of space. Fundamental physics missions will require the micro-propulsion system to be in almost continuous operation for the duration of the scientific data collection period. For LISA Pathfinder this is many months and thus a lifetime of at least 6000 hours must be demonstrated, as discussed by Aplin et al (2004) and Kent et al (2004). Secondly, the neutraliser must be able to withstand operation at the exterior of a spacecraft, including the possibility of low fluxes of neutral metal atoms produced by charge exchange processes from the thruster. The emission of electrons also generates ions in the region between the tip and gate, which may bombard the silicon tips. In higher-pressure environments such as low earth orbit there are also relatively high concentrations of atomic oxygen, which could attack the neutraliser structure. This paper focuses on the use of a thin coating of insulating material to protect the silicon tip electron emitters. Coating silicon tips was initially suggested to overcome the perceived shortcomings of silicon, particularly mechanical fragility and low thermal conductivity, leading to the possibility of overheating. Attempts have been made to improve the robustness of the Si emitter tips by coating them with materials such as diamond like carbon (DLC), an artificially-produced form of amorphous carbon with a varying sp2/sp3 bond ratio (e.g. Xu et al, 2001) or aluminium nitride (AlN) (Zhirnov et al, 1997).    33 Overview of field emitter fabrication and test programme   The silicon field emitter arrays are fabricated in-house at the RAL Central Microstructures Facility (CMF), using techniques described by Wang et al (2004) and Huq et al (2001). The complete neutraliser will utilise 66 2 x 7mm die, each containing 20 arrays, with each array holding 765 tips emitting ~7nA each, to make the total current 6mA. In the test programme described in this paper, individual chips were prepared, each containing 20 arrays on a 2 x 7mm die mounted on a dual in line package. The operating principle that if a voltage is applied to the chromium gate, which is electrically insulated from the grounded tip structure, the small dimensions and sharp point of the tip result in very high electric fields at the tip apex, where electrons are emitted by quantum tunnelling (e.g. Brodie and Spindt, 1992). A scanning electron microscope photograph of a typical field emitter array is shown in Figure 1. The physics of field emission is described by the Fowler-Nordheim equation, and from it an exponential relationship can be derived between the voltage applied to the field emitters V, and the emitted current I (e.g. Brodie and Spindt, 1992). It can also be shown that if ln(I/V2) is plotted against 1/V then a linear relationship can be expected if field emission is occurring. Plotting the current-voltage response of field emitter arrays is a good test for field emission, and the current emitted at a particular voltage also indicates the power consumption of the device. The laboratory test set up, described in detail in Aplin et al (2004), was therefore devised principally to conduct current-voltage tests of field emitter samples. In space the electrons are attracted to the positive ions emitted from the thruster, but in the laboratory test scenario a Faraday cup held at 300V is used to attract the electrons; the current to it was monitored using a Keithley 487 picoammeter/voltage source. The current emitted by the silicon tips and losses to the gate were measured using two more Keithley 487 instruments. Computer-controlled procedures were used to automatically increase and decrease the gate voltage and write the voltages and currents measured to a text file. One important aspect of field emitter behaviour is the need to “condition” arrays once they have been exposed to the ambient laboratory environment. This is the need to repeat I-V curve measurements until the results no longer show hysteresis effects, related to removal of surface impurities from the field emitter structure. The RAL field emitter conditioning procedure is described by Collingwood (2004).  The same apparatus was used to measure the lifetime of samples running at a constant tip emission current, achieved by adjusting the gate voltage in software. Each array on the test chip needs to emit 5µA for the completed neutraliser to produce the 6mA needed to equal the ion beam current. Predefined criteria based on the mission specifications were chosen to define “failure”: if the voltage required > 200V, or  > 20% of the emitted current was lost to the gate electrode (Aplin et al, 2004). The nominal operating current for the arrays was defined as 6 µA, to allow for a 20% loss to the gate.   4 Coating field emitter arrays  The theoretical basis for improving silicon field emitter performance by adding coatings of wide band gap materials (WBGM) on field emitter tips was presented by Zhirnov et al (1997). If a field emitter tip is coated with a dielectric layer of a WBGM such as CaF2, AlN or DLC, the electric field penetrates into and through the layer and  4is concentrated at the conductive tip beneath the dielectric. Electrons are assumed to either quantum tunnel from the semiconductor into the conduction band of the WBGM, where they are transported through the conduction band to the surface, or they tunnel into localised states in the WBGM and then move between these states to the surface. WBGM with negative electron affinity (NEA) surfaces, such as AlN and DLC, are often preferred for coatings, as the conduction band at the surface of such a WBGM may be pinned below the vacuum level, allowing the electrons to escape directly into a vacuum. Coating with NEA materials may therefore enhance emission, by reducing the effective work function.  There are additional, simple reasons why adding a coating to silicon field emitter arrays may be particularly beneficial in space applications. The coating can act as a protective layer against adsorption and ion bombardment. Adding a layer of material with a different thermal conductivity to silicon may also protect the tip against failure by melting. The enhanced performance expected from coated tips is also a strong motivation for using a coating in space, when efficiency and minimising power consumption are important. Experimental evidence exists in the literature that both AlN and DLC coatings can improve the performance of silicon field emitter arrays. For example, Zhirnov et al (1997) reported that coating a silicon tip with AlN reduced the operating voltage by 33% and increased the current output. Jung et al (2000) also found that a DLC coating decreased the effective work function and reduced the operating voltage of the field emitter array. At RAL both AlN and DLC coatings have been evaluated, and Figure 2 shows the basic tip structure and the coating layer. AlN coatings were applied in-house at the CMF at the end of the tip fabrication process, using magnetron sputtering to deposit a layer of aluminium nitride over the whole array structure. This process is described in more detail in Wang et al (2004). DLC coatings were applied at the Manufacturing and Engineering Systems Department, Brunel University, again at the end of the fabrication procedure, using plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (PACVD) (e.g. Christiansen et al, 1996). The PACVD technique produces a hydrogenated DLC layer using a radio frequency plasma in a mixture of hydrogen and acetylene (C2H2) (Pierson, 1993; Franks, personal communication, 2004). Unlike diamond and graphite, the physical structure, composition and properties of DLC are highly dependent on the sp2/sp3 bond ratio and the fraction of hydrogen present, which are in turn affected by the details of the processing technique. This can be an advantage as the fabrication technique can be tailored to achieve the desired properties (Pierson, 1993). However, the small quantity of samples used in this study did not justify the application of solid-state analysis techniques required to characterise them in detail.   5 Testing coated arrays  The availability of in-house AlN coating technology meant that it was possible to coat more field emitter test chips, and carry out more detailed tests on AlN than DLC coated samples. For the AlN coating, a calibration procedure was defined where blank silicon die were coated, and the thickness measured with the Nanometrics 210, Film Thickness System (Nanospec) which uses a refractive index technique to determine the thickness of a thin layer in its “Thin Nitride on Silicon” programme. This permitted control of the AlN thickness deposited on the field emitter arrays. The DLC coating thickness was estimated in the same way, as a unique programme was not available on the Nanospec.  5Standard tests, carried out on both AlN and DLC coated samples, were: 1. current-voltage curves: used to determine emission current, and projected power consumption, discussed in section 5.1 2. endurance tests: running the samples at constant current until they failed pre-defined performance criteria, as was described in Section 3. The effects of different coatings on sample lifetime are described in section 5.2. The effect of different thicknesses of AlN coating was also investigated by building up the thickness of the layer slowly on one sample and carrying out performance tests at each stage, with the results presented in section 5.4.   5.1 Current-voltage tests  29 AlN coated test arrays were subjected to current-voltage tests, compared to 6 DLC coated arrays. The DLC coated arrays required considerably higher initiation threshold voltages, typically ~150V, than arrays coated with a similar thickness of AlN and uncoated arrays, which usually began to field emit at ~100V and 90V respectively. The typical I-V characteristics of an AlN coated array and a DLC coated array of similar thickness are compared with the I-V characteristics of an uncoated array in Figure 4a. The DLC coated arrays generally operated at significantly higher voltages than the uncoated and AlN coated arrays, which is inconsistent with predictions that DLC coatings could improve emission efficiency (Xu et al, 2001). From the I-V curves, the average voltage required for a conditioned array to emit the nominal current of 6 µA (defined in section 2) was found to be 81 ± 2V for the AlN coated arrays and 93 ± 3V for the DLC coated arrays. Figure 4b shows I-V test results for similar thickness coatings of AlN and DLC. The magnitude of leakage to the gate electrode does not appear to be affected by the coating type, but the emitted current is higher for the AlN coated sample, indicating it is the more power-efficient coating.  5.2 Endurance tests  Lifetimes of up to 6000 hours have already been demonstrated for AlN coated arrays (Aplin et al, 2004; Kent et al, 2004), indicating that AlN coated field emitter arrays can meet the ESA specification for the LISA Pathfinder satellite. This section therefore focuses on the typical characteristics of endurance tests on DLC coated arrays, compared to uncoated arrays. Figure 5 shows the results from a typical endurance test of two DLC coated arrays wired together. The sample was run at a constant emission current of 12 µA (Figure 5c), and failed when the gate current (Figure 5b) exceeded the limit of 20% of the tip current after ~40 hours. Figure 6 shows an endurance test run on an uncoated sample that suffered an abrupt failure, probably related to overheating (Aplin et al, 2004) after 23 hours.   There are differences between the uncoated and DLC coated samples. Firstly, the DLC current recorded at the collector (Faraday cup, Figure 5a), is noisier at the start of the test than the uncoated trace. Collingwood (2004) has suggested that the noise is caused by surface impurities due to inadequate conditioning, which are subsequently removed by heating during the endurance test. The RAL conditioning procedure was initially developed for uncoated tips, and appears to be adequate for AlN coated tips. This suggests that both uncoated and AlN coated tips may have similar surface properties, which are not the same as the DLC coated tips, though detailed surface analysis techniques would be required to check this. Secondly, as was  6indicated in section 5.2, the operating voltage of the DLC coated tips (Figure 5d) is higher than the uncoated tips (Figure 6d) and a greater voltage variation is required to hold the tips at constant current compared to the uncoated sample. Again, this may be related to inadequate conditioning at the start of the test. After 10 hours however, the gate voltage variability is still greater than for the uncoated tips, possibly suggesting the surface properties of the DLC tips vary more rapidly than the uncoated tips.  Some of the differences between Figure 5 and Figure 6 are likely to be related to the mechanism ultimately causing array failure, rather than coating effects. Using the failure classifications in Aplin et al (2004), the DLC coated array (Figure 5) failed gradually, and the uncoated array (Figure 6) failed abruptly. Assuming the increased variability in emitted current in the first ten hours for the DLC coated sample is due to inadequate conditioning, the emitted current (Figure 5c) shows an initially similar level of variability, ±16%, compared to the uncoated tips (Figure 6c). During the test, the variability of the DLC coated tip emission drops, which is associated with a decreasing number of tips emitting (e.g. Shaw and Itoh, 2001). This is almost certainly a symptom of the gradual deterioration of the array, as is the trend in gate voltage in Figure 5d. More endurance tests on different coated arrays would be required to determine how the coating influences failure type, as the array failure statistics from the relatively small number of samples discussed for this paper were inconclusive.  5.3 Thermal effects  As mentioned in Section 4, the use of a layer of material of different thermal conductivity on silicon field emitter arrays may increase their lifetime. The proposed mechanism is that a coating of increased thermal conductivity can conduct heat away from the tip apex and make it less likely to melt at high current densities. The thermal conductivity of 2-4Ωm n-type Si has been estimated, corresponding to 1-3 x 1015 atoms/cc of phosphorous dopant. The thermal conductivities of Si, AlN and DLC are shown in Table 1. The table also indicates the number of samples suspected to have failed by overheating during endurance tests (described in Section 3 and in Aplin et al, (2004)). The number of thermal failures does not appear to correlate with the thermal conductivity. DLC has the highest thermal conductivity, but had the highest fraction of assumed thermal failures. AlN had the lowest number of thermal failures, yet actually has a lower thermal conductivity than silicon. Possible explanations for this are that the thermal conductivity of DLC is lower than the estimated value, or that the failure mechanism classifications are inadequate. However, thermal models of silicon field emitter tips, (Aplin et al, 2004), run for a wide range of silicon thermal conductivities, indicated that an AlN layer had minimal effect on predicted tip temperatures, despite its low thermal conductivity. It is probable that the small volumes of coating used have little effect on the tip temperatures, and the number of abrupt failures is related to the intrinsic variability between different samples tested.  5.4 Effect of changing AlN coating thickness  Two uncoated central wafer dies, 275 and 276, were characterised electrically by I-V tests and with an optical microscope. These tests indicated that the samples were similar in geometry and electrical performance. In an experiment to determine the optimum thickness of AlN, both dies were then sequentially coated with several layers of AlN. The range of AlN thickness investigated was ~5-20nm, estimated from  7a calibration test on a blank silicon wafer. 275 was initially coated with ~5nm AlN, and 276 with ~10nm, followed by subsequent ~5nm layers to compare the effect of increasing the coating thickness. I-V tests were carried out on both die between each coating stage. Figure 7 shows the effect of adding successive layers of AlN to one sample, 275 (the second sample, 276 responded similarly). It is clear the presence of a thin (4.15nm) layer improves the performance of the sample by reducing the operating voltage and increasing the emission current. The absolute magnitude of the leakage current to the gate is the same as, or less than for the uncoated sample. The effective neutralisation current, i.e. the current leaving the array structure = (emission current - gate current) is therefore higher for 4.15nm coated than uncoated tips. Thicker coatings perform less well than the uncoated sample: both the emission current decreases, and the operating voltage increases as the thickness increases. The fraction of current returning to the gate electrode is high for the thickest (13.75nm) AlN coating and some resistive leakage current has developed which is apparent at low voltages, before field emission starts. The origin of this low voltage leakage current is unclear. Results from both samples are summarised in Table 2.  6 Conclusions  AlN and DLC-coated samples of silicon field emitter arrays have been compared, and AlN is preferred, on the basis of the samples tested. DLC coated samples had higher power consumption, running at voltages typically 30% higher than a similar thickness of AlN coating. Endurance tests showed that DLC coated samples lasted on average longer than uncoated samples but less long than AlN coated samples. In endurance tests, DLC had more variable emission characteristics than other samples. One possible explanation is that DLC coated samples are rougher than AlN and uncoated samples, and the surface properties are therefore more dynamic as current emission shifts position to wherever the local electric field is highest. According to Pierson (1993) however, application of a DLC coating often makes a sample smoother than it was originally. Further investigation is required to physically characterise the DLC samples tested in this paper. DLC coatings appear promising, but optimisation experiments similar to those carried out on AlN coated samples in Section 5.4 are required as well as extensive analyses to characterise the physical properties of the layer, such as accurate thickness determination.  It has been suggested that coatings of higher thermal conductivity than silicon, such as DLC can reduce the incidence of tip melting. Results presented in this paper are inconsistent with this, as AlN coated tips, which have a lower thermal conductivity than silicon, survived for longer than both uncoated and DLC coated tips, with lower rates of thermal failure. Thermal modelling studies indicated that a thin AlN coating had minimal effect on field emitter temperatures, and it is possible that the coatings used are simply too thin to have any appreciable thermal effect. Surface effects may also play a role, but high-technology microscopy would be required to examine silicon tips and their coatings in detail. Results of both current-voltage (Section 5.1) and endurance tests (Section 5.2; also see Aplin et al (2004) and Kent et al (2004)) on AlN coated silicon field emitter arrays showed that an AlN coating could meet the ESA power and reliability criteria for a neutraliser for fundamental physics missions. Experiments layering samples, selected for their consistent response and similarity to each other, with increasing thicknesses of AlN were described in Section 5.4. They indicated that a thin coating is  8optimal and enhances emission by reducing operating voltage and increasing current output, presumably by reducing the effective workfunction of the sample as discussed in Section 4. However thicker layers of AlN were less desirable, increasing operating voltage, and appearing to show some resistive leakage at voltages lower than the levels required for field emission. The AlN coating thickness for the FEEP neutraliser engineering model has been chosen based on the results of these experiments.

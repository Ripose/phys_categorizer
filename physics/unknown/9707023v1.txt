Abstract

We consider the nonstandard constrained KP (ncKP) hierarchy which is
obtained from the multi-constraint KP hierarchy by gauge transformation.
The second Hamiltonian structure of the ncKP hierarchy can be simpliﬁed
by factorizing the Lax operator into multiplication form, thus the generalized
Miura transformation is obtained. We also discuss the free ﬁeld realization of
the associated W-algebra.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, there are several intensive studies on the relationships between
conformal ﬁeld theory and integrable system which include, in particular, exploration of the
role played by the classical W -algebras in integrable systems [1]. It’s Adler map (see, for
example, [2]) from which the W -algebras can be constructed as Poisson bracket algebras.
A typical example is the Wn algebra constructed from the second Gelfand-Dickey (GD)
structure of the n-th Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) hierarchy [3,4]. Amazingly, by factorization
of the KdV-Lax operator, the second Hamiltonian structure is transformed into a much
simpler one in an appropriate space of the modiﬁed variables. Thus the factorization not only
provides a Miura transformation which maps the n-th KdV hierarchy to the corresponding
modiﬁed hierarchies, but also gives a free ﬁeld realization of the Wn algebra. This is what we
called the Kupershmidt-Wilson (KW) theorem [5,6]. The generalization of the KW theorem
to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy and its reductions have been discussed [7–13].
In general, the above scheme is encoded in the particular form of the Lax operator and its
associated Poisson structure. Therefore, the number of integrable hierarchies where the KW
theorem works is quite limited.

Recently, Q P Liu [14] conjectured that the above scheme also works for the constrained
modiﬁed KP (cmKP) hierarchy [15], which is a kind of reduction of the KP hierarchy.
The proof has been given in two recent papers [16,17] based on the observation [18] that
the second Hamiltonian structure of the cmKP hierarchy can be mapped into the sum of
the second and the third GD brackets. Therefore one can factorize the Lax operator of
the cmKP hierarchy into linear terms.
In this paper, we generalize the previous results
[16,17] to the nonstandard constrained KP (ncKP) hierarchy [15], which is obtained from
the gauge transformation of the multi-constraint KP hierarchy [15]. We ﬁnd that the second
Poisson structure of the ncKP hierarchy can be simpliﬁed by factorizing the nonstandard
Lax operator into multiplication form containing inverse linear terms.

This paper is organized as follows: In Sec.II we consider the multi-constraint KP hierar-
chy. Using the 2-constraint KP hierarchy as an example, we calculate its Poisson brackets
from its second Hamiltonian structure and discuss its associated conformal algebra. Then
in Sec. III we perform a gauge transformation to obtained the nonstandard cKP hierarchy
and the corresponding Poisson brackets. We ﬁnd that after mapping the nonstandard Lax
operator to a 1-constraint KP Lax operator, the Poisson structure becomes the sum of the
second and the third GD brackets deﬁned by the 1-constraint KP Lax operator. We also
show that the conformal algebra associated with the nonstandard Lax operator is encoded
in the conformal algebra of the 1-constraint KP Lax operator. In Sec. IV we simplify this
Poisson structure by factorizing the Lax operator into multiplication form and thus obtain
the generalized Miura transformation. Conclusions and discussions are presented in Sec. V.

II. MULTI-CONSTRAINT KP HIERARCHY

The multi-constraint KP hierarchy is the ordinary KP hierarchy restricted to pseudo-

diﬀerential operator of the form

2

L(N,M ) = ∂N + u2∂N −2 + · · · + uN +

φi∂−1ψi.

M

Xi=1

The evolution of the system is given by

∂kL(N,M ) = [(Lk/N
∂kφi = ((Lk/N

(N,M ))+, L(N,M )],
(N,M ))+φi)0,

∂kψi = −((Lk/N

(N,M ))∗

+ψi)0

where φi and ψi are eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions, respectively. (Notations:(A)±
denote the diﬀerential part and the integral part of the pseudo-diﬀerential operator A re-
spectively, (A)0 denotes the zeroth order term, and * stands for the conjugate operation:
(AB)∗ = B∗A∗, ∂∗ = −∂, f (x)∗ = f (x)).

The second Hamiltonian structure associated with L(N,M ) is given by the second GD

bracket as follow

where the last term in (2.4) is just the Dirac constraint imposed by u1 = 0 on L(N,M ).
In the following, we will discuss the simplest example (N = 1, M = 2) in detail.
The 2-constraint KP hierarchy with order one is deﬁned by

L(1,2) = ∂ + φ1∂−1ψ1 + φ2∂−1ψ2

From (2.4) the basic second Poisson brackets are given by

{φi, φj} = −(φi∂−1φj + φj∂−1φi),
{ψi, ψj} = −(ψi∂−1ψj + ψj∂−1ψi),
{φi, ψj} = (δijL(1,2) + φi∂−1ψj),

which is obviously nonlocal. The algebraic structure of the Poisson brackets is transparent
if we set t ≡ φ1ψ1 + φ2ψ2, then

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

Hence φi and ψi are spin-1 ﬁelds with respect to the Virasoro generator t, and (2.7) form
a nonlocal extension of the Virasoro algebra by four spin-1 ﬁelds. We would like to remark
that the algebra (2.7) can be generalized to the multi-constraint case (N = 1, M > 2) by
setting t =

M
i=1 φiψi .

{t, t} = 2t∂ + t′,
{φi, t} = φi∂ + φ′

III. NONSTANDARD CKP HIERARCHY

The nonstandard Lax operator is obtained by performing a gauge transformation on

L(1,2) as follow

where

K(1,2) = φ−1

1 L(1,2)φ1,

= ∂ + v1 + ∂−1v2 + q∂−1r

v1 = φ′
q = φ−1

1/φ1,
1 φ2,

v2 = φ1ψ1,
r = φ1ψ2.

The transformed Lax operator K(1,2) satisﬁes the hierarchy equations

∂nK(1,2) = [(K n
∂nq = ((K n
∂nv2 = −((K n

(1,2))≥1, K(1,2)],
(1,2))≥1q)0,

∂nr = −((K n

and the transformed second Hamiltonian structure now becomes [15]

where the basic Poisson brackets can be easily written as

{v1, v1} = 2∂,
{v1, v2} = ∂2 + ∂v1 + ∂q∂−1r,
{v1, q} = −q′∂−1,
{v1, r} = −r,
{v2, v2} = ∂v2 + v2∂ + v2q∂−1r + r∂−1qv2,
{v2, q} = −∂q + v1q − v2q∂−1 − r∂−1q2,
{v2, r} = ∂r − v1r + r∂−1qr − r∂−1v2,
{q, q} = −2q∂−1q + ∂−1q2 + q2∂−1,
{q, r} = ∂ + v1 + 2q∂−1r + ∂−1v2 − ∂−1qr,
{r, r} = −2r∂−1r.

These Poisson brackets are nonlocal as well. To simpliﬁed the above Poisson brackets, we
may consider the operator

where

L(2,1) = ∂K(1,2)

= ∂2 + u1∂ + u2 + φ∂−1ψ

u1 = v1,
φ = q′,

u2 = v2 + v′
ψ = r.

1 + qr,

Using (3.7) we can calculate the Poisson brackets for {u1, u2, φ, ψ} which now become simpler

etc. Note that these brackets are not the same as the ones constructed from the second GD
brackets for the 1-constraint KP hierarchy where the corresponding brackets are given by
[15]

{u1, u1} = 2∂,
{u1, u2} = −∂2 + ∂u1,
{u1, φ} = φ,
{u1, ψ} = −ψ,
{φ, φ} = −2φ∂−1φ

{u1, u1} = −2∂,
{u1, u2} = ∂2 − ∂u1,
{u1, φ} = −φ,
{u1, ψ} = ψ,
{φ, φ} = −φ∂−1φ.

etc. In fact, it can be shown [see Appendix] that (3.11) obey the following Poisson structure

{F, G} =

where

L(2,1))+ + [L(2,1),

(3.14)

Besides the second GD structure, the last term in (3.14) is called the third GD structure
which is compatible with the second one [3]. Thus the Hamiltonian structure associated
with L(2,1) is the sum of the second and the third GD structures.

Before ending this section, let us discuss the algebraic structure associated with the
ncKP hierarchy. Based on the dimension consideration, we can deﬁne a Virasoro generator
t ≡ v2 + v′

1/2 + qr. Then from (3.7), we have

{v1, t} = v1∂ + v′
1,
∂3 + 2t∂ + t′,

{t, t} =

{q, t} =

q∂ + q′ −

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.15)

We see that v1 and r are spin-1 and spin-3/2 ﬁelds, respectively and q is not a spin ﬁeld due
2 ∂−1q∂2 ”. However, if we take a derivative to the third bracket
to the anomalus term “− 1
in (3.15), then q′ becomes a spin-3/2 ﬁeld, i.e.

This motivate us to covariantize the Lax operator L(2,1) rather than the operator K(1,2).
Form (3.11), L(2,1) can be covariantized by setting the Virasoro generator t ≡ u2 − 1/2u′
1,
and

{q′, t} =

q′∂ + q′′.

Therefore, the conformal algebra associated with K(1,2) is encoded in the conformal algebra
of L(2,1) .

IV. THE GENERALIZED MIURA TRANSFORMATION

In this section, we will show that the Poisson structure (3.14) has a very interesting prop-
erty under factorization of the operator L(2,1) into multiplication form. Since the operator
of the form L(2,1) has multi-boson representations, we can factorize L(2,1) into the following
form

L(2,1) = (∂ − a1)(∂ − a2)(∂ − a3)(∂ − b1)−1

(4.1)

where the variables {u1, u2, φ, ψ} and {a1, a2, a3, b1} are related by

u1 = b1 − (a1 + a2 + a3),
u2 = u1b1 + 2b′

which is called the Miura transformation. Now let us ﬁrst consider the second GD bracket
under the factorization (4.1). Thanks to the generalized KW theorem [10–13], the second
GD bracket can be simpliﬁed as

(3.16)

(3.17)

(4.2)

(4.3)

{ai, aj}GD
{b1, b1}GD
{ai, b1}GD

2 = −δij∂,
2 = ∂,
2 = 0,

Hence the remaining tasks are to study the third GD structure. In the previous paper [16],
we have shown that the third structure has also a very nice property under factorization of
the Lax operator containing inverse linear terms (4.1). It turns out that [16]

{F, G}GD

)′

which leads to

{ai, aj}GD

3 = {ai, b1}GD

3 = {b1, b1}GD

3 = ∂.

Combining (4.3) with (4.5) we obtain

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

Therefore, the Lax operator K(1,2) (and hence L(1,2)) has a simple and local realization of
their Poisson structures.

{ai, aj} = (1 − δij)∂,
{b1, b1} = 2∂,
{ai, b1} = ∂.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that the second Hamiltonian structure of the ncKP hierarchy has a very

simple realization. In terms of {a1, a2, a3, b1} the Lax operator K(1,2) can be factorized as

K(1,2) = ∂−1(∂ − a1)(∂ − a2)(∂ − a3)(∂ − b1)−1

(5.1)

and the second Poisson structure (3.7) is mapped to a much simpler form (4.6). In general,
we should consider the multi-constraint KP hierarchy with the Lax operator of the form
(2.1). After performing the gauge transformation K(N,M ) = φ−1
1 L(N,M )φ1, the Lax operator
L(N,M ) is transformed to

K(N,M ) = ∂N + v1∂N −1 + · · · + vN + ∂−1vN +1 +

qi∂−1ri

(5.2)

M −1

Xi=1

which satisﬁes the nonstandard hierarchy equations (3.5) and has the Hamiltonian structure
(3.6). Moreover we can follow the strategy in Appendix to prove without diﬃculty that the
Hamiltonian structure associated with the operator L(N +1,M −1) ≡ ∂K(N,M ) is just the sum
of the second and third GD structure (3.14). Thus by applying the previous results [16], the
Lax operator of the ncKP hierarchy can be factorized as

K(N,M ) = ∂−1(∂ − a1) · · · (∂ − an)(∂ − b1)−1 · · · (∂ − bm)−1

(5.3)

and the simpliﬁed Poisson brackets turn out to be

7

{ai, aj} = (1 − δij)∂,
{bi, bj} = (1 + δij)∂,
{ai, bj} = ∂.

Finally we would like to remark that the Poisson bracket matrix (5.4) is symmetric and
nonsingular, thus it is not diﬃcult to diagonalize the matrix to obtain the free ﬁeld rep-
resentation which would be useful to quantize the W-algebra associated with the ncKP
hierarchy. The details of these discussions will be presented in a forthcoming paper [19].

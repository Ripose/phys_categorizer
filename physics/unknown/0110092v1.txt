Abstract Based on a fundamental symmetry between space, time, mass and charge, a series 
of  group  structures  of  physical  interest  is  generated,  ranging  from  C2  to  E8.  The  most 
significant result of this analysis is a version of the Dirac equation combining quaternions 
and  multivariate  4-vectors,  which 
intrinsically 
supersymmetric, and which automatically leads to a symmetry breaking, with the creation of 
specific particle structures and a mass-generating mechanism. 
 
 
1 Introduction 
 

is  already  second  quantized  and 

Physics  appears  to  be  an  attempt  at  deriving  something  from  nothing.  There  is  no 
evidence  to  suppose  that  what  we  describe  as  ‘reality’,  either  in  the  concrete  sense  of 
something directly perceived, or in the sense of an ontological concept beyond immediate 
perception, has any defining characteristic. In fact it would appear that ‘reality’ or ‘nature’ 
goes out of its way to avoid being characterized. Physicists have learned to deal with this by 
default, effectively by a natural selection of the only method which works. This is to insert a 
probe  into  nature,  observe  how  the  response  denies  validity  to  the  probe,  and  then 
incorporate both probe and response under the guise of ‘symmetry’.1 

Inserting  a  probe  is  the  process  we  define  as  ‘measurement’  or  observation. 
Measurability depends on discreteness. The simplest discrete thing is a point. So we start 
with  the  creation  of  a  point  or  point  ‘particle’.  A  single  particle  has  to  have  inherent 
symmetries.  The  most  fundamental  belong  to  the  four  parameters  space,  time,  mass  and 
charge (if we take charge in its most general sense as the source of strong and weak, as well 
as electromagnetic interactions). Space and time are the only true ways of approaching the 
concept of variation in nature, while mass and charge provide the conserved sources of the 
four known interactions: gravity; electromagnetism; and the strong and weak nuclear forces. 
It  has  never  been  demonstrated  that  anything  in  physics  is  more  fundamental  than  these

concepts, and it has never been demonstrated that we can construct physics on any other 
basis. We will now show that these fundamental concepts are not independently defined but 
have  fundamental  symmetries  which  connect  them,  linked  with  three  distinct  properties. 
Parameters  may  be  conserved  or  nonconserved;  orderable  or  nonorderable;  countable  or 
noncountable. Each parameter takes on one of each of these properties or its symmetric (and 
absolute) opposite, and the four parameters, taken together on the basis of these properties, 
form  a  group.  The symmetry constrains each  parameter  to have one property in common 
with each other, and two which are entirely opposite.2-6 It will be necessary to our argument 
to give a detailed discussion of the different aspects of this symmetry. 
 
2 Conserved or nonconserved 
 

The conservation laws are the most fundamental in physics, and they are the source of 
its  universality.  The  most  fundamental  principles  of  physics  are  essentially  equivalent to 
statements that some quantities are absolutely conserved while others are allowed to vary 
without  restriction;  and  all  such  conservation  principles  are  derived  ultimately  from  the 
conservation  properties  of  mass  and  charge.  Fundamental  physics  assumes  that  the 
conservation of electric charge is true in all conceivable circumstances, and such properties 
of fundamental particles as lepton and baryon conservation suggests that the same principle 
applies also to the sources of the strong and weak interactions. Mass (in the sense of mass-
energy, or the source of the gravitational force) is also absolutely conserved; and all these 
conservation laws are local, applying to the amount of each quantity at a given place in a 
given time. Classically, we give each element of mass or charge an identity which it retains 
throughout  all  interactions,  subject  only,  in  the  case  of  charge,  to  its  annihilation  by  an 
element  with  the  opposite  sign;  and,  although  the  identity  of  individual  particles  is  not 
maintained in quantum mechanics, we still retain the requirement of local conservation. 

Since  mass  and  charge  are  alike  in  their  absolute  conservation,  space  and  time  are 
constrained  to  be  opposite  in  their  absolute  nonconservation.  This  manifests  itself  in  a 
number of ways. The nonidentity of the elements of space and time is manifested in their 
property of translation symmetry. So each element of space and time is exactly like every 
other, and physical equations must be structured to incorporate this. Two very significant 
physical principles follow from this via Noether’s theorem, the mathematical result which 
states that, for every global transformation preserving the Lagrangian density, there exists a 
conserved quantity. Thus, the translation symmetry of time requires, and is identical with, 
the conservation of energy, while the translation symmetry of space requires, and is identical 
with, the conservation of linear momentum. Space, as a three-dimensional quantity, also has 
rotation symmetry, or nonidentity of spatial direction, which Noether’s theorem equates to 
the conservation of angular momentum. 

By analogy, to show the exact oppositeness of the conserved quantities, we may apply a 
concept of translation asymmetry to both mass and charge, as another expression of local 

 

2 

conservation.  Each  element  of  mass  and  charge  is  untranslatable  to  any  other.  Such 
conserved  quantities  can,  of  course,  only  be  defined  with  respect  to  changes  in  the 
nonconserved  quantities,  and what we define as interactions can often be thought of as a 
statement of all those possible changes in the nonconserved quantities which will maintain 
the  value  of  the  conserved  ones.  We  look  at  what  remains  invariant  (conserved)  under 
certain  groups  of  transformations  (nonconserved).  The  aspects  of  identical  particle 
wavefunctions which are truly interchangeable in quantum mechanics are the nonconserved 
space and time coordinates rather than the conserved charges. 

The conserved quantities, of course, include composite ones such as energy, momentum 
and  angular  momentum,  as  well  as  the  more  elementary  ones,  mass  and  charge,  but  the 
conservation  of  the  composite  ones  depends  directly  on  the  conservation  of  the  more 
elementary  ones,  and  each  of  the  composite  conservation  laws  relates also  to one  of the 
aspects of the nonconservation of space or time. The behaviour of all physical systems is 
then  described  entirely  in  terms  of  a  combination  of  conservation  and  nonconservation 
principles, the nonconservation of space and time usually requiring them to be expressed by 
differentials. 

Gauge  invariance,  as  used  in  both  classical  and  quantum  physics,  is  the  classic 
expression of how a system remains conservative under arbitrary changes in the coordinates 
which do not produce changes in the values of conserved quantities such as charge, energy, 
momentum  and  angular  momentum;  and  quantum  mechanics  is  simply  the  ultimate 
expression  of  the  arbitrariness  of  spatial  and  temporal  coordinates,  which  are  subject  to 
absolute  and  arbitrary  change.  Significantly,  the  Yang-Mills  principle  used  in  particle 
physics  requires  nonconservation,  in  the  form  of  arbitrary  phase  changes,  to  be  local  in 
exactly the same way as conservation. 

 

3 Orderable or nonorderable 
 

Although Minkowski, in 1908, in mathematically uniting space and time coordinates in 
what we now call a 4-vector, proclaimed that: ‘From now on, space by itself, and time by 
itself,  are  destined  to  sink  into  shadows,  and  only  a  kind  of  union  of  both  to  retain  an 
independent  existence’,7  the  very  structure  of  the  4-vector  proves  that  the  two  concepts 
retain significant physical differences. Thus, while Pythagorean addition produces positive 
values for the squares of the three spatial dimensions, the squared value of time becomes 
negative in the Minkowski 4-vector. In other words, time is represented by an imaginary or 
nonorderable number. Only its square has an orderable value; the time coordinate itself does 
not. This imaginary representation is often claimed as merely ‘convenient’, but there is no 
obvious reason why it should be convenient to do such a non-physical thing. However, when 
we  also  realize  that  an  imaginary  representation  for  time  also  makes  uniform  velocity 
imaginary,  while acceleration  remains real, we can see that there might be other physical 
reasons for using it.

The parallel representation of mass and charge is also instructive. Force terms require 
squared masses and charges, which we can imagine as being combined in the same way as 
the  squared  space  and  time  terms  in  Pythagorean  addition.  However,  there  remains  the 
unexplained fact that forces between like masses are attractive, whereas forces between like 
(electric) charges are repulsive; that is, the forces between like masses and like charges, and 
hence the squared values of those masses and charges, have opposite signs. If, however, we 
choose  to  represent  charges  by imaginary numbers and  masses by  real ones,  we  create  a 
symmetrical representation for the Newton and Coulomb force laws: 

 

 

F = – 

F = –

4πεor2  

 

 

 

In addition, the other two charged-based forces, the strong and weak interactions, are 
like the electric force in being repulsive for like particles, and so the source terms for these 
forces are also presumably defined by other imaginary numbers. The natural mathematical 
description for this arrangement is the quaternion system, discovered in 1843, in which i, j 
and k, the three square roots of –1, are related by the formulae: 

          

 

      i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = –1 . 

With mass taking up the role of the real part, the charge-mass quaternion becomes the 
exact symmetrical opposite of the space-time 4-vector, with three imaginary parts and one 
real one (an ordinary real number), as opposed to three real parts and one imaginary. The 
quaternions,  which  break  the rule of commutativity, also have extra significance in being 
unique. No other extension of ordinary complex algebra to incorporate multiple imaginary 
dimensions is possible, unless we are also prepared to break associativity, and, even then, 
the 8-part octonions or Cayley numbers, which break associativity, are the only remaining 
division algebra after the real and complex numbers and quaternions. In other words, if we 
wish  to  have  an  associative  division  algebra,  which  includes  nonorderable  (imaginary) 
multidimensional  quantities,  then  we  are  restricted  precisely  to  a  3-dimensional  system. 
Hamilton,  who  first  discovered  the  quaternions  after  finding  that  a  system  with  two 
imaginary parts was impossible, felt that he had discovered in them the explanation for the 
3-dimensionality  space,  with  time  taking  up  the  fourth  or  real  part.  According  to  our 
analysis, quaternions are more conveniently applied to the three imaginary components of 
charge, with mass taking up the real part. However, space and time then become a three real- 
and  one imaginary-part system by symmetry. The three components of charge (say, ie, js, 
kw) can, in this way, be considered as the ‘dimensions’ of a single charge parameter, with 
their squared values used in the calculation of forces added, in the same way as the three 
parts of space, by Pythagorean addition:

An important consequence of making this symmetry exact is that the vector property of 
space  must  be  extended  to  incorporate  a  quaternionic-like  ‘full’  product  between  two 
vectors, combining the scalar product with i times the vector product. The extra vector terms 
in  this  product  are  responsible  for  the  otherwise  ‘mysterious’  spin  property  in  quantum 
mechanics. 

Though  charge,  like  space,  is  multidimensional,  charge  dimensions  will  show 
differences  to  spatial  dimensions,  since  charge  is  a  conserved  quantity,  unlike  space.  In 
particular, we can expect conservation in dimension as well as in quantity. Charge should 
exhibit a rotation asymmetry, in which the sources of the electromagnetic, weak and strong 
interactions are separately conserved, and incapable of interconversion. (This does not affect 
the Weinberg-Salam unification of electromagnetic and weak forces, which is a statement of 
the identity of effect in the two interactions, under ideal conditions, not of identity of the 
sources; the three quaternion operators i, j and k are different sources, though identical in 
effect.)  Baryon and  lepton  conservation  are obvious  consequences, since  baryons are the 
only particles with strong, as well as weak, components, and leptons are the only particles 
with  weak,  but  no  strong,  components.  The  proton,  also,  which  has  a  strong  charge 
measured by its baryon number, will not be able to decay to products like the positron and 
neutral pion, which have none. 

Various further benefits also result from the nonorderable nature of imaginary numbers. 
One  is  that mass,  which  is  real  in  itself  as well as  in its  squared  value, has  two physical 
manifestations: inertia, which is the property of the linear term, and gravitation, which is the 
property of the squared value. We can detect a single mass through the property of inertia, 
independent of its interaction with other masses, whereas a charge is only detectable in the 
presence  of  another  charge.  Another  benefit  is  that  real  numbers,  by  their  property  of 
orderability, allow positive (or negative) solutions to be privileged in algebraic equations; 
imaginary  numbers,  as  nonorderable  quantities,  do  not.  Hence,  every  complex  (or 
quaternion)  equation  which  has  a  positive  solution  also  has  an  algebraically 
indistinguishable negative solution (the complex or quaternion conjugate). Thus, though we 
can  use the real  nature  of mass to  privilege the positive value in algebraic equations, we 
cannot choose a positive solution for charge without allowing the equal possibility of the 
negative  one.  The  consequence  of  this  is  the  existence  of  antiparticles,  for  even  those 
particles,  such  as  the  neutron  and  neutrino,  which  have  no  electric  charge  still  have 
antiparticles because they have strong and / or weak charges whose signs may be reversed.

4 Countable or noncountable 
 

It  is  important  that  we  recognize  that  only  space  is  ever  measured.  All  observable 
objects  define  a  space,  and so  any object can be used,  in principle, for measuring space, 
without setting up any special conditions. This is not true of time. It is often claimed that 
clocks are devices used for measuring time, but measurement implies repetition and time, as 
an  irreversible  parameter,  cannot  be  repeated.  In  fact  all  clocks use  some concept  of the 
repetition of a spatial interval, and require very special conditions and assumptions to make 
even this possible. 

The  ancient  paradoxes  of  Zeno  of  Elea  are  directly  concerned  with  the  differences 
between space and time. One famous example is the race between Achilles and the Tortoise, 
where Achilles can never catch up if he gives the Tortoise a start, no matter how much faster 
he is. Another is the Dichotomy Paradox, in which an object moving over any distance can 
never get started because it must cover half the distance before it covers the whole, and a 
quarter of the distance before it covers half, and so on; thus, an infinite number of operations 
are required for the object to move any distance in a finite amount of time. 

The problems  arise, as numerous philosophers have realized, from the idea that time 
must  be infinitely  divisible, like space. However, it is much more likely that time, unlike 
space, is an absolute continuum, without measurable instants; that is, it is truly analogue, 
and  the  mental  category  of  absolute  continuity  exists  precisely  because  of  this.  This  is 
apparently what, for example, Henri Bergson believed, but he also believed, as we do not, 
that  time  is  ‘fundamentally  irreducible  to  mathematical  terms’.8  This  seems  to  be  untrue 
because a mathematics involving absolute continuity would appear to be possible in terms of 
Cantor’s definition of the real numbers. The numbers representing time are noncountable, 
but they can be represented in mathematical terms. 

However, absolute continuity is not compatible with indefinite divisibility, such as we 
perceive  in  space,  in  either  mathematical  or philosophical terms.  The  very divisibility  of 
space is what denies it absolute continuity; the elastic nature of the divisibility comes from 
the entirely different property of nonconservation. Space, as a countable or noncontinuous 
quantity,  will  certainly  have  units,  but,  because  it  is  also  a  nonconserved  quantity, these 
units  will  not  be  fixed;  and  the  whole  process  of  measurement  through  space  depends 
crucially on these two properties. 

The countability of space requires it to be discontinuous in both quantity and direction, 
to be  reversible  and capable  of changes in orientation; without these properties, practical 
measurement  would  be  impossible.  The  irreversibility  of  time,  however,  is  precisely  the 
same  property  as  its  noncountability  or  absolute  continuity.  Reversal  cannot  be 
accomplished without discontinuity, nor can changes in orientation. So it is clear that time, if 
it  is  to  be  absolutely  continuous,  cannot  have  multiple  dimensions.  The  so-called 
‘reversibility paradox’ has time reversible in mathematical sign, according to nearly all the 
laws of physics, but not reversible in physical consequences. This, however, is a result of 

 

6 

using  imaginary  numbers  to  characterize  time.  Imaginary  numbers  are  not  privileged 
according to sign, and so must allow equal validity to positive and negative mathematical 
solutions,  but  the  property  of  continuity  or  noncountability  ensures  that  the  physical 
apprehension of time will be in a single direction. 

The noncountability of time is also responsible for the fact that time, in the definition of 
velocity and acceleration, the basic quantities used in dynamics, is the independent variable, 
whereas space is the dependent variable. We have no control over the variation of time, as 
we have of space, and so its variation is necessarily independent. 

For symmetry, we require one other parameter to be continuous, or noncountable, like 
time; this is mass (or mass-energy, the source of gravitational interactions). This is present at 
every point in space in the form of the filled vacuum or Higgs field, and its signature is the 
unipolarity of the parameter or the absence of negative mass, just as the signature of time’s 
continuity is its irreversibility. It is also, as we will see, the source of nonlocality in quantum 
mechanics. The unipolarity of mass is the reason why we have a CPT, rather than an MCPT, 
theorem, C standing for charge conjugation, P for space reflection and T for time reversal, 
all of which have two mathematical sign options. 

This means that the remaining parameter, charge, must be discontinuous or countable, 
like space. Charge is, of course, observed in discrete units, which, unlike those of space, are 
fixed, because charge is also a conserved quantity. It is also, like space, multidimensional. 
Multidimensionality,  as we have seen,  cannot be a property of continuous quantities, but 
there are also direct arguments for suggesting that it must be an essential property of discrete 
ones. In principle, we cannot demonstrate discreteness in a one-dimensional system. A line, 
for  example,  which  is often used as  an  illustration of  one-dimensionality, can, in fact, be 
constructed only within a system which is at least two-dimensional. Truly one-dimensional 
space  would  produce  only  a  point with no  extension. We couldn’t  use it to  demonstrate 
discreteness, and certainly not the variable discreteness characteristic of space. 

It  seems  to  be  multidimensionality  as  such,  rather  than  any  particular  degree  of 
multidimensionality  which  is  responsible  for  creating  the  additional level of discreteness 
required by the introduction of algebraic numbers, and even of transcendental numbers such 
as  π;  two  independent  dimensions  are  all  that  we  require  to  create  the  required  level  of 
incommensurability at the rational number level. So it would seem that the introduction of a 
third  dimension  requires  no  qualitatively  new  type  of  number.  Also,  although  only  the 
rational numbers are needed to define the measurement process using a single dimension, 
the nonconserved nature of space means that the units can be redefined any way we like and 
so we may well need some version of constructed reals to link all possible systems of units, 
and to express this degree of freedom. 

Dimensionality,  as  such,  may  be  defined  as  the  use  of  Pythagorean  addition,  or  the 
addition of the squared values of numbers, as a separate process from ordinary addition. In 
this sense, all the parameters are dimensional, and dimensionality may be considered as an 
ultimate result of the dualities evident in the fundamental group symmetry, such as the co-

 

7 

existence of symmetrical real and imaginary quantities. The process of squaring becomes 
related  to  the  process  of  doubling,  and  the  process  of  square-rooting  becomes related to 
division by the factor 2, which is itself related to the creation of the mathematical concepts 
of – 1 + 1 = 0 and 1 + 1 = 2. The creation of the original discrete or point-like ‘probe’ and its 
symmetrical negation can be considered as a process of generating something from nothing 
which  is  necessarily  dual  in  its  outcome.  We  create  something,  but  the  totality  of  the 
something and its symmetrical opposite reduces it to nothing. In fact, to generate something 
from  nothing,  our  point-particle  probes  have  to  become  nilpotents,  which  are  nonreal in 
themselves, and which square to zero in their only real manifestation. 

The  dimensionality  of  charges  and  masses  has  an  important  physical  manifestation. 
Charge and mass elements, unlike those of space and time, are individual and conserved, 
and so the process of ‘squaring’ becomes a universal ‘interaction’ between each individual 
element and  each  other, which is  intrinsically nonlocal,  and which manifests itself in the 
classical concept of force and in the quantum mechanical wavefunction. At the same time, 
our  use  of  the  in-built  4-vector  connection  between  space  and  time  will  ensure  that  the 
transfer of energy between discrete particles of matter remains time-delayed by the constant 
relating space and time units in their mathematical combination. 

The physical difference between space and time has significant consequences when we 
combine them dimensionally in the Minkowski 4-vector. We are obliged to either make time 
space-like (or discrete) or to make space time-like (or continuous), and so we automatically 
generate  dualistic  theories.  Classic  examples  of  choosing  the  discrete  option  are  particle 
theories, special relativity and Heisenberg’s quantum mechanics, while the corresponding 
results of the continuous options are wave theories, Lorentzian relativity and Schrödinger’s 
wave  mechanics.9-11  In  the  Heisenberg theory,  mass  and time effectively become discrete 
quantities,  while  Schrödinger  makes  space  and  charge  continuous  in  the  wavefunction. 
These options are only true of the mathematical structure, for the process of measurement 
respectively restores continuous mass via the uncertainty principle and the virtual vacuum, 
and discrete space and charge via the collapse of the wavefunction. 

The  fundamental  distinction  between  the  physical  status  of  space  and  time  has 
consequences for mathematics as well as for physics. From the beginning, there were two 
processes  of  differentiation:  a  discrete  one,  modelled  on  variation  in  space,  using 
infinitesimals;  and  a  continuous  one,  modelled  on  variation  in  time,  defined  by  a  limit 
process. Mathematically, neither option is any more valid than the other, for differentiation 
is a property linked to nonconservation, and not concerned, in principle, with the difference 
between absolute continuity and indefinite divisibility. However, in physical terms, there are 
differences, for example in the solutions of Zeno’s paradoxes, which require the continuous 
concept of a limiting process to achieve a valid result. 

In  more  recent  times,  it  has  become  apparent  that  the  Cantorian  definition  of  an 
absolutely  continuous  set  of  real  numbers  cannot  be  applied  to  space,  which  is  not 
continuous  but  infinitely  divisible.  It  would  seem  that,  to  describe  space,  we  must                      

 

8 

use Skolem’s ‘non-standard’ arithmetic of 1934, with its denumerable model of the reals, 
and  the  non-Archimedean  geometry,  which  relates  this  to  space,  in  addition  to  the  non-
standard analysis of Abraham Robinson, which treats infinitesimals as though they had the 
properties of real numbers. These versions of non-standard mathematics are a reflection of 
the discrete nature of space while ‘standard’ results (based on limiting processes) rely on the 
continuity  of  time.  Both  methods  give  valid  proofs  for  purely  mathematical  theorems, 
because both are valid in a purely mathematical sense, and the validity of the non-standard 
methods is established by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, which states that any consistent 
finite, formal theory has a denumerable model, with the elements of its domain in a one-to-
one correspondence with the positive integers. It would seem that available mathematical 
options arise simultaneously with the available physical options, and ultimately stem from 
physical symmetries. Continuity and discontinuity, finiteness and infinity, and so on, would 
not exist as mathematical categories unless they were also physical categories. 

A further significant aspect of nonstandard analysis is that it has been a key ingredient 
in developing topos theory, which provides a view of space as arising from some kind of 
mathematical  structure  and  possibly  including  dynamism,  the  points  of  the  space  being 
infinitesimal (but smeared) and nilpotent, or square roots of zero. Topos theory offers very 
attractive possibilities for formalizing some of the points made here. Space, in the present 
theory, arises from the process of counting or measurement; dimensionality is a necessary 
consequence of discreteness (or smearing); dynamism, with time, mass and charge emerging 
automatically  from  the  symmetry,  is  in  this  sense  in-built;  and,  as  we  will  see  later,  the 
nilpotent wavefunction which we will construct for the pointlike charges could be related to 
the  nilpotents  needed  to  construct  the  points  in  space,  especially  as  the  nilpotent 
wavefunction creates an infinite series of further nilpotents in the continuous vacuum. 

 

5 Object group structure 
 

From  the  previous  sections,  it  would  appear  that  the  four  basic  parameters  are 
distributed between three sets of opposing paired categories: real / imaginary (alternatively, 
orderable 
/  noncountable 
(alternatively,  discrete  /  continuous,  divisible  /  indivisible).  Each  parameter  is  paired  off 
with a different partner in each of the categories, according to the following scheme: 

/  nonorderable),  conserved 

/  nonconserved,  countable

Where properties match, they are identical, and where they oppose, they are in exact 
opposition.  Each  pair  forms  an  abstract  group,  and  therefore  defines  the  symmetry  of  a 
physical object. The pairs (orderable / nonorderable) and (conserved / nonconserved) each 
form C2 groups of order 2:

The real / imaginary pair, however, forms a C4 group (1, i, –1, –i) of order 4. The total group 
structure is then C4 × C2 × C2 (or C4 × D2), of order 16. 

The 4-component structure does not, however, describe the complete symmetry of an 
object.  Since  we  have  three  categories,  each  with  two  values,  there  is  a  total  of  eight 
parameters. In addition to the above four, there exist four dual parameters, given by

It has been suggested, previously, that these are the effective representations of space, time, 
mass and charge as used in the non-quantum-field version of the Dirac theory.4-6 The ‘dual 
group’ to space, time, mass and charge will, of course, have many manifestations, of which 
the  Dirac  representation  is  just  one.  Such  representations,  will  involve  mathematical 
reversals of physical properties. However, it seems likely that any representation other than 
the canonical one (that is, the original group) will always be reduced to the canonical one 
under  the  process  of  measurement,  as  we  have  seen  happens  with  the  Heisenberg  and 
Schrödinger formulations of quantum mechanics.  

The  dual  parameters  must  possess  the  same  C4  ×  D2  structure,  thus  the  total  group 
symmetry  must  be  of  order  32.  Additionally,  these  dual  structures  must  mutually 
anticommute. Since the dual of C4 is itself, the complete group structure must be C4 × Q4, 
where  Q4  is  the  quaternion  group  (of  order  8).  This  structure is simply  the  complexified 
quaternions. The total group structure may therefore be represented by a quaternion vector 
pair, where we have the following assignments:

Real scalar 

Imaginary scalar 

Real 3-vector 

 

 

 

mass 

time 

space 

 

 

 

Imaginary quaternion 

charge 

 

 
We  see  then  that  the  symmetry  structure  of  an  object  requires  not  only  a  3-dimensional 
space, but also a 3-component charge. Futhermore, it is clear that mass and charge possesss 
the same general structure as space and time, coupled together to form a unified concept of 
‘mass-charge’. 
 
6 Object symmetry and the Standard Model 
 

Taken together, the complex quaternions above do not form a general group. It is clear, 
in  fact,  that  general  object  symmetry  cannot  form  a  group,  as the  existence of  nilpotents 
(such  as  these  describe)  is  central  to  quantum  duality.  However,  one  is  led  to  ask  if  the 
complex quaternion algebra is the product of some larger symmetry group, which appears in 
its current form via spontaneous symmetry breaking. There are a number of ways in which a 
supersymmetry can be created. Perhaps the simplest is to represent the state of an object as a 
vector-like term, as in 

O => 1 + i + j + k + i + iI + iJ +iK 

In this form, the state of an object resembles a broken octonion. The dimensionality in 
this representation presupposes the concept of rotation, and the rotational symmetry of an 
octonion is the exceptional Lie group G2. The above vector is then an octonion with one 
orientation  (in  this case  i) constrained so  as  not  to transform  into  other  coordinates.  The 
symmetry group of such a constrained octonion is SU(3). Within this constrained symmetry, 
there exist two other obvious subgroups: the quaternion vector, with symmetry SU(2), and 
the complex ‘vector’, with symmetry U(1). It is clear then that object symmetry has the form 
SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1), which can be generated from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of 
the octonion symmetry G2.  

It is clear the inherent symmetry of an abstract object, with no a priori internal structure 
is required to have the internal structure of the standard model. The standard model therefore 
arises from the basic properties of space, time, mass and charge.

7 Symmetry hierarchy 
 

Although  we  have  demonstrated  the  foundational  approach  is  sufficiently  general  to 
encompass  the  standard  model,  we  have  not  yet  presented  a  complete  picture  of  object 
symmetry.  The foundational  properties of space, time, mass, and charge mandate a direct 
connection to the full set of division algebras (real, complex, quaternion, octonion), as seen 
above. As a result, the foundational approach is closely related to a hierarchy of symmetry 
structures derived from these algebras. The most famous of these hierarchies is known as the 
Freudenthal-Tits Magic Square, which is a 4 × 4 array of groups, associated with the Jordan 
algebras of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices. The result is derived from the groups G × G, and is 
given by

It is clear from this table that products of the octonion algebra, together with the octonion 
symmetry  G2, form the set of exceptional Lie algebras which are of such great interest in 
higher dimensional models such as string theory. 

We have shown, then, a fundamental connection between the foundational symmetries 
of  space,  time,  mass,  and  charge,  and  the  ‘higher’  symmetries  of  models  such  as  string 
theory and the standard model. Clearly, there exists enough freedom to express these models 
in a foundational context. Furthermore, one can argue that the foundational approach is more 
powerful, as it requires the above symmetries as a consequence, rather than imposing them a 
priori. 
 

8 The D2 ‘canonical’ representation 
 

The group representation that we choose for the fundamental parameters will depend on 
what we are actually looking at; purely ‘qualitative’ conceptions of a parameter’s nature put 
into symbolic form will produce different representations to those derived using the internal 
algebras  generated  by  the  parameters  themselves.  In  a  purely  symbolic  sense,  we  may 
represent the properties of space (real, nonconserved, countable) by, say, a, b, c, with the

opposing properties (imaginary, conserved, noncountable) represented by –a, –b, –c. The 
arrangement now becomes:

Mathematically, the scheme encompasses a group of order 4, in which any parameter 
can  be  the  identity  element and  each  is its  own  inverse. With  multiplication  rules  of the 
form: 
 
 
 
 
and similarly for b and c, we can establish a group multiplication table of the form: 
 
 
* 

a * a = –a * –a = a 
a * –a = –a * a = –a 
a * b = a * –b = 0

This is the characteristic multiplication table of the Klein-4 or D2 group, with space as 
the  identity  element  and  each  element  its  own  inverse.  However,  there  is  no  reason  to 
privilege space with respect to the other parameters, since the symbols a and –a, b and –b, c 
and  –c  are  arbitrarily  selected,  and  any  of  the  other  three  parameters  may  be  made  the 
identity  by  defining  its  properties  as  a,  b,  c.  For  example,  if  mass  is  made  the  identity 
element, then the group properties may be represented by:

The dual group may be represented symbolically by: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this case the multiplication rule is: 
 
 
 
 
 
and the group multiplication table becomes: 
 

a * a = –a * –a = –a 
a * –a = –a * a = a 
a * b = a * –b = 0

Here,  mass*  becomes the identity  element,  though, again this arbitrary, and changing the 
signs of both b and c, for example, would make space* the identity element. 

That D2 is more fundamental than C2 may seem at first a surprising result, as C2 is the 
simplest possible group, a direct description of the ‘something from nothing’-type duality 
with  which  we  began.  However,  physics  is  ultimately structured on  the need to  define  a 
concept of measurement (the ‘probe’) and a single fundamental C2 would not allow this. By 
definition,  a  perfect  C2  symmetry  would  simply  create  an unrecognizable ‘response’ to  a 
measurement  probe;  and,  while  a  perfect  C2  would  be  meaningless,  an  ‘imperfect’  C2 
(allowing oppositeness in only a limited number of characteristics) would be incomplete. 
The  simplest  perfect  symmetry  (in  the  physical  sense)  based  on  the  C2  principle,  which 
allows recognition of the response, is then D2. 
 
9 Conservation laws and fundamental symmetries 
 

Assuming  that  the  D2  group  containing  space,  time,  mass  and  charge  is  the  only 
available physical information at the fundamental level, it is possible to provide derivations 
of the equations of classical mechanics and electromagnetic theory.4-6 The already existing 
numerical relations between space and time units, and mass and charge units, extend also by 
group  symmetry  to  relations  between  the  units  of  every  fundamental  quantity  and  every 
other, and their inverses. This is the origin of G, h and c as fundamental constants. Quantum 
mechanics follows when we define a new conserved operator and apply total variation of 
space and time. At the same time, the continuity of mass-energy defines a new meaning for 
the  field  equations  of  general  relativity,  directly  incorporating  inertial  effects  while 
preserving  the  classical  structure  of  gravity.12-16  However,  completely  new  mathematical 
results can also be generated by even more direct uses of the symmetries.  These results are 
extensions  of  the  application  of  Noether’s  theorem  to  the  conservation  laws  of  energy, 
momentum  and  angular  momentum.  In  fact,  Noether’s  theorem  itself,  linking  conserved 
quantities  with  transformations, is really  an  expression  of  the fact that every fundamental 
conserved quantity must be symmetrical to a fundamental nonconserved quantity. 

 

15 

In one application of Noether’s theorem, as we have seen, we link the conservation of 
energy  (or  mass,  in  our  terms)  to  the  translation  symmetry  of  time.  In  effect,  the 
nonconservation  of  time  is  responsible  for  the  conservation  of  mass,  a  result  which  is 
evident  in  our  original  symmetry  group.  By  extending  the  analogy,  we  can  link  the 
conservation of the quantity of charge with the nonconservation, or translation symmetry of 
space,  and,  hence,  the  conservation  of  linear  momentum.4-6  We  can, therefore,  propose  a 
theorem in which the conservation of linear momentum is responsible for the conservation 
of the quantity of charge – of any type. We can also link the conservation of type of charge 
to  the  rotation  symmetry  of  space,  or  the  conservation  of  angular  momentum,  as  in  the 
following scheme:

In fact, physical theorems already exist which show these principles to be true in special 
cases. The conservation of electric charge within a system was shown by Fritz London, in 
1927, to be identical to invariance under transformations of the electrostatic potential by a 
constant representing changes of phase, with the phase changes being of the kind involved in 
the conservation of linear momentum. In a conservative system, electrostatic potential varies 
only with the spatial coordinates, and so the London principle implies that the quantity of 
electric  charge  is  conserved  because  the  spatial  coordinates  are  not. This is, therefore,  a 
special case of the first predicted relation. 

In  the  second  case,  we  have  the  relation  between  spin  and  statistics  observed  in 
fundamental  particles.  Fermions  have  half-integral  spin  angular  momentum,  while  for 
bosons  this  quantity  becomes  integral;  fermions  also  have  weak  units  of  charge,  while 
bosons have none. The presence of a particular type of charge thus appears to determines the 
angular momentum state of the particle, so conservation of this type of charge in a particle is 
linked with the conservation of its angular momentum state. We will subsequently show that 
the  general theorem is fundamental  to the understanding  of particle  structures and  to the 
symmetry-breaking between the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions.

10 A hierarchy of dualities 
 

We can, as we have seen, construct a D2 group for space, time, mass and charge on the 
basis of assigning algebraic symbols to properties without concerning ourselves about the 
actual mathematics associated with the four parameters. However, as soon as one assigns 
such mathematics, the group relationship changes. The resulting structures form a hierarchy 
of  dualities,  analagous  to  the  hierarchy  of  dualities  that  we  can  use  to  create  the  natural 
numbers  in  binary  form.  The  hierarchy  stems  from  the  fact  that  any  mathematical 
representation of a symmetry will necessarily be an imperfect or ‘broken’ symmetry, like the 
definition of a ‘system’ in the context of Newton’s third law of motion, and will necessarily 
lead to a doubling process, tending to a more ‘perfect’ symmetry. 

The doubling can be seen as a realization of the fact that everything has to have a dual 
or C2 partner to make something from nothing, and the mathematics within the parameter 
structures has to be constructed so that the doubling process is actually possible. The real / 
imaginary distinction and 3-dimensionality are ways in which doubling can occur, but they 
act in subtly different ways. Both ideas are associated with the squaring process, which is a 
kind of doubling, just as square rooting is a kind of halving. This means that squaring via C2 
is as natural a way of producing ‘something from nothing’-type duality as adding. 

We  can  explain  the  duality  hierarchy  in  terms  of  a  ‘Fundamental  Theorem  of 
Symmetry’: For every symmetry, there must exist a corresponding asymmetry. As such, a 
simple duality can always be represented as C2. If we define science as the measurement of a 
system to determine results, there will be three basic duals. The System Dual corresponds to 
conservation / nonconservation. A system consists of an object within an environment. The 
object and the environment are therefore dual. Mass and charge, here, are object properties, 
space  and  time  are  environment  properties.  The  Measurement  Dual  corresponds  to 
countability / noncountability (discreteness / continuity). For any system, counting is either 
possible, or it is not. Thus ‘measurable’ and ‘nonmeasurable’ (countable and noncountable) 
are dual. Space and charge are countable, time and mass are not. The Observation Dual does 
not correspond directly to the real / imaginary distinction, but it creates it indirectly in the 
form of the duality between the ‘canonical’ D2 group and its own dual, and it is central to the 
idea of ‘probe’ and ‘response’. Any measurement consists of the observer and the observed. 
Thus observer / observed are dual.  

Though these three dualities must exist within any scientific model, they also generate 
further  dualities.  The  System  /  Observation  also  forms  a  duality,  since  it  creates  two 
possibilities:  the  object  is  the  observer  and  the  environment  is  the  observed,  or  the 
environment  is  the  observer  and  the  object  is  the  observed.  It  is  this  duality  which  is 
expressed when we reverse the physically incorrect assumptions of either the Schrödinger or 
the Heisenberg mathematical systems in the process of measurement. 

The System / Observation Dual corresponds directly to the real / imaginary distinction 
since  it  is  a  two-fold  dual.  That  is,  there  are  four  quantities  (object-observer,  object-

 

17 

observed,  environment-observer,  environment-observed),  and  they  must  have  an  internal 
duality. This is why the real / imaginary distinction becomes C4 = (1, –1, i, –i), where (1, –1) 
and  (i,  –i)  have  a  dual  symmetry.  This  last  duality  is  also  what  generates  the  classical  / 
quantum symmetry, and can explain why the i shows up in quantum mechanics. We can also 
say that the real / imaginary distinction is what doubles the original group to include the dual 
group.  So  the  creation  of  a  dual  group  is  the  same  thing,  in  effect,  as  making  the  real  / 
imaginary distinction explicit. We can further suppose that any of the C2 dualities in space, 
time, mass and charge will produce the factor 2, which occurs in many aspects of physics as 
a direct mathematical expression of the fundamental nature of duality, and that one duality 
can be translated into another. The C2 ‘something from nothing’ doubling is then extended 
to higher orders automatically, because of its own ‘self-dynamism’. 

The  important  aspect  for  the  space,  time,  mass,  charge  model  is  that  there  is  an 
asymmetry in the formulation. In this sense, even the fundamental parameter group of space, 
time,  mass  and  charge  is  a  mathematically  (though  not  physically)  broken  symmetry, 
because the full C2 × C2 × C2 (which includes the dual group) is not needed for physics at 
any given time, but only half of it. The System, Observation, and System-Observation duals, 
also, form a closed set. The Measurement duality is not part of this set, rather it is a kind of 
truth ‘external’ to the system. This means the four duals do not form a group, but require a 
set of order 32 which is not a group, but which has the complex numbers as a subgroup. 
Thus, the result is the complexified quaternions. The higher doublings then occur through 
the recognition of this structure as a larger group structure, and lead, through the application 
of the rotation symmetries implicit in the multidimensional parameters, to the creation of the 
Lie algebras. 

 

11 Dimensionality 
 

We have seen that, bringing in the real / imaginary distinction doubles the order of the 
group; introducing 3-dimensionality doubles it again. The doubling effect is natural, due to 
the basic concept of duality, and the 3-dimensionality is itself related to the real / imaginary 
distinction, but the process of creating multidimensionality by doubling is very subtle. The 
only way for a group to have some form of ‘dimensionality’ is for it to be non-abelian or 
non-commutative in some form. It is not possible for a non-abelian group to be the product 
of  abelian  groups.  Therefore,  one  cannot  simply  ‘generate’  dimensionality  out  of  the 
‘doubling’  effect,  alone.  The  smallest  dimensional  finite  group  is  the  quaternion  group, 
which is of dimension 3 (not 4, since ‘time’ is commutative). This appears at order 8. Of the 
5 finite groups of order 8, C8, C2 × C4, C2 × C2 × C2, D4, and Q, all are abelian except for Q. 
So, somehow there must be an argument requiring Q, or at some higher order, a non-abelian 
group of which Q is a subgroup. 

3-dimensionality is a source  of the factor  2 in many aspects of physics. Dynamically 
and  quantum  mechanically,  the  factor  2  is  associated  with  vector  terms.  Dynamically  it 

 

18 

comes  from  action  and  reaction,  or  the  virial  theorem  (as  a  direct  product  of  3-
dimensionality); quantum mechanically, it comes from the noncommutativity of the vector 
terms  in  the  spin  angular  momentum. In  general, the  factor 2 in  physics comes from the 
division between discreteness – the source of multidimensionality – and continuity. In the 
group  structures  it  is  also  associated  with  the  division  between  real  and  complex 
representations. The complex version of Dirac algebra (as will be described in section 13) 
has 32 terms, as opposed to the ‘real’ version with 16. It must be relevant, therefore, that it is 
the imaginary version of vector algebra (in the quaternion) which requires 3-dimensionality 
or 3+1-dimensionality. 

In principle, the ‘rule of doubling’ means that the multidimensionality of quaternions 
has to be of such an order as would create the same number of elements as we would get by 
doubling, even though they will not be the same elements. That is, considerations of duality 
mean  that  we  need  a  doubling  of  elements,  but  some  other  fundamental  consideration 
requires that the perfection of the originally abelian symmetry is violated, and the doubling 
occurs  in  a  ‘broken’ way. Duality  itself  creates the spatial 3-dimensionality, and  the  3+1 
dimensionality  of,  say,  space  plus  time,  mass  and  charge  (or  space,  time  and  mass  plus 
charge) becomes the double 3+1 dimensionality of space plus time and mass plus charge 
when we double the grouping by including the dual group. But this is a requirement, not a 
prescription. 

In  the  space,  time,  mass,  charge  set,  3-dimensionality  becomes  a  necessary  result, 
through symmetry, of extending the real / imaginary distinction from time to charge. Charge, 
being  discrete,  is  necessarily  multidimensional,  and,  being  also  imaginary,  requires  a 
description in the form of a multidimensional imaginary algebra. What seemingly happens is 
that  the  group  duality  consideration,  requiring  a  multiplication  of  elements  such  that the 
number of elements increases from 4 to 8, but allowing only 2 of the elements to acquire the 
property that would make this possible, requires 3-dimensionality, and this 3-dimensionality 
is expressed by what we happen to call quaternions, of order 8, which are noncommutative 
because of the rotation property. The real / imaginary division itself then requires a further 
multiplication  of  elements  from  8  to  16,  creating,  in  the  process,  the  parallel  3-
dimensionality of the real vector parameter, space. 

One method of producing the quaternion group mathematically would be to start with 
the three dualities, of conservation / nonconservation, countability / noncountability, real / 
imaginary,  and  treat  them  initially  as  simple  C2  symmetries,  with  two categories,  exactly 
opposite. These product to C2 × C2 × C2, of order 8. But then, if we take the real / imaginary 
duality, although only contributing an order 2, as, mathematically, of the form C4, we could, 
by symmetry, take each of the dualities to be of the same form. In other words, the group of 
order 8 would have 3 unique C4 subgroups. Q has three C4 subgroups as its only subgroups. 
Thus, the order 8 group would be Q, automatically introducing dimensionality of order 3. 

Like  the  direct  doubling  due  to  the  real  /  imaginary  distinction  (which  creates 
mathematics of ordered pairs), it would seem that the dimensional doubling is related to the 

 

19 

introduction of imaginary numbers. Both are a product of the Pythagorean squaring process, 
which  is  simultaneously  an  expression  of  dimensionality  and  of  the  group  relationships 
between the fundamental parameters, in addition to being the actual mechanism by which 
the  group  doubling  process  becomes  related  to  the  mathematical  factor  2.  In the  case of 
multidimensional  quantities  this  factor  is  derived  by  making  dimensional  multiplication 
noncommutative,  and  only  3-dimensional  quantities  may  accomplish  this  in  a  way  that 
preserves  symmetrical  closure.  In  addition,  symmetry  considerations  determine  that  only 
two  parameters  may  become  multidimensional,  and  so  only  two  have  this  property  of 
noncommutativity. 

is  certainly 

the  origin  of 

From a purely physical point of view, the central origin of dimension can be taken as 
the particle / wave duality, which comes directly from the discrete / continuous division, for 
this 
the  division  between  multidimensionality  and 
unidimensionality.  Only  discrete  quantities  can  have  more  than  one  dimension,  and 
discreteness requires more than one dimension; while continuous quantities must necessarily 
be  unidimensional.  Particles  express  discreteness,  though  they  have  no  dimension  (or 
extension) themselves; waves express continuity, but, as the opposite of particles, must, in a 
sense, have dimension. Effectively, particles mark the discreteness of space, by being the 
divisions or zero points of it, and so, in this sense, are not discrete at all. Once again, this is 
similar to the Heisenberg-Schrödinger distinction. Each incorporates its opposite to be able 
to define itself. There is a dual aspect to everything. 
 
12 A broken octonion 
 

We  can  consider  the  original  group,  space,  time,  mass  and  charge  and  dual  group, 
space*,  time*,  mass*,  charge*,  as  the  ‘commutative’  and  ‘noncommutative’  ways  of 
producing  the  abstract  D2  structure,  and  we  can  combine  the  two  into  a  larger  group 
structure  C2  ×  D2  of  order  8.  For  example,  the  identity  element,  say  mass,  could  be 
represented by the scalar part of a quaternion (1) and the other three terms by the imaginary 
operators i, j, k, while mass*, charge*, space*, time* are represented by –1, –i, –j, –k. So,

If  the  3-dimensionality of  charge  and space is directly involved, the overall structure 
requires a quaternion (±1, ±is, ±je, ±kw) and a quaternion-like 4-vector (±i, ±ix, ±jy, ±kz) (a 
double quaternion in total) within another overall quaternion-type arrangement. This can be 
accomplished using an octonion, with sixteen members (±1m, ±is, ±je, ±kw, ±et, ±fx, ±gy, 
±hz) (see below). Although this is no longer a group, it combines two conjugate groups of 
order  8:  M,  C(3),  S(3),  T  and  M*,  C(3)*,  S(3)*,  T*,  and  can  be  represented  in  a  group 
structure  through  the  use  of  left-product  or  right-product  octonions.  In  addition,  the 
nonassociativity of the dimensional terms in this octonion extension seems to be lost within 
terms which effectively cancel each other out, and are of no physical significance.

If  we  take  charge  as the identity element, and  represent it by a scalar, the remaining 
structure  for  time,  space  and  mass  (and,  implicitly,  the  energy,  momentum  and  mass 
operators) becomes that of the Dirac algebra, and SU(5) or U(5) (as described later). Such 
representations do not determine the properties of the group members, space, time, mass and 
charge.  They  exist  because  the  group  has  four  components,  and  can,  therefore,  be 
represented  by  a  4-component  structure  like  a  quaternion,  in  which  the  link  between 
elements is made by a binary operation (squaring); but the link between a group with four 
components and a 4-dimensional space-time or mass-charge may be in itself significant. In 
addition, the D2 group is the group of rotations of the rectangle (identity and rotations about 
three spatial axes). This could be another way of linking the double 3+1 symmetry of the 
units of space, time, mass and charge with the structure of the group. 
 
13 The Dirac algebra 
 

Only two members of the original group, say space and time, are needed to define the 
structure.  We  can  create  quantum  mechanics  with  a  third,  say  mass  or  charge.  A broken 
octonion symmetry creates for us the algebra we will need for quantum mechanics. Here, the 
8-unit octonion splits into a 4-vector part, representing space and time, with real vector units 
i,  j,  k  and  imaginary  scalar  i;  and  a  quaternion  part,  representing  charge  and  mass,  with 
imaginary  vector  units  i,  j,  k  and  real  scalar  1.  The  quaternions  follow  the  usual 
multiplication rules: 
                                                 i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1 
                                                      ij = −ji = k 
                                                      jk = −kj = i 
                                                      ki = −ik = j , 
 
while,  to  make  the  two  algebras  completely  symmetrical,  the  real  vector  units  follow 
multivariate multiplication rules, identical to those for Pauli matrices, and parallel to those 
for quaternion algebra: 

22 

                                                       i2 = j2 = k2 = 1 
                                                       ij = −ji = ik 
                                                       jk = −kj = ii 
                                                       ki = −ik = ij . 
 
In effect, this requires a ‘full product’ for two vectors a and b of the form 
 
                                                  ab = a.b + i a × b . 
 

Recombining the two algebras using the eight base units, i, j, k, i, i, j, k, 1, we define a 
new  algebra  with  32  parts,  which  is  isomorphic  to  the  Dirac  algebra,  defined  by  the  5 
γ matrices,17-25 and we can make correlations of the form: 

 

   γo = −ii 
   γ1 = ik 
   γ2 = jk 
   γ3 = kk 
   γ5 = ij  

    or 
 
 
 
 

   γo = ik 
   γ1 = ii 
   γ2 = ji 
   γ3 = ki 
   γ5 = ij . 

 
The  complete  algebra  incorporates:  1  real  scalar,  1  imaginary  scalar,  3  real  vectors,  3 
imaginary vectors, 3 quaternions, 3 imaginary quaternions, 9 real vector quaternions and 9 
imaginary vector quaternions. The full 32 parts can be derived as follows: 
 
 
 
 

γo = ik, γ1 = ii, γ2 = ij, γ3 = ik, γ5 = ij, 

1 

γoγ1 = iji, γoγ2 = ijj, γoγ3 = ijk, γoγ5 = i, γ1γ2 = −ik, 
γ1γ3 = ij, γ1γ5 = iki, γ2γ3 = −ii, γ2γ5 = ikj, γ3γ5 = ikk, 

γoγ1γ2 = kk, γoγ1γ3 = −kj, γoγ1γ5 = i, γoγ2γ3 = ki,γoγ2γ5 = j, 
γoγ3γ5 = k, γ1γ2γ3 = −ii, γ1γ2γ5 = jk, γ1γ3γ5 = −jj, γ2γ3γ5 = ji, 

γoγ1γ2γ3 = j, γoγ1γ2γ5 = −iik, γoγ1γ3γ5 = iij, γoγ2γ3γ3 = −iii, γ1γ2γ3γ5 = k, 

γoγ1γ2γ3γ5 = −i. 

  
The 32 parts become a group of order 64 when + and – values of the terms are taken into 
account. Terms of the opposite sign are produced by reversing the order of multiplication.

We factorize and attach the exponential term e-i(Et -  p.r) (which expresses the required total 
variation in space and time), so that 
 
                             (± kE ± ii p + ij m) (± kE ± ii p + ij m) e-i(Et - p.r) = 0 ,

equation itself). With the m term fixed as positive, the equation defines four solutions, which 
represent the four possible combinations of ± E (particle / antiparticle) and ± p or σ.p (spin 
up  /  down).  These  four  (=  2D/2)  solutions  are  demanded  by  the  use  of  a  quaternion 
representation and a 4-D space-time, and are most conveniently represented using a column 
(or row) vector, as in the standard representation of the Dirac spinor. Superpositions of two 
states will then require a scalar product between the four terms representing each state.

The wavefunctions are nilpotents or square roots of zero, and the four terms of the form 
(± kE ± ii p + ij m) are anticommuting pentads, with five elements, including three for the 
vector  term  ii  p.  The  nilpotent  aspect  is  particularly  significant,  as  we  have  seen,  in  the 
context  of  topos  theory,  and  in  the  general  context  of  deriving  something  from  nothing. 
Without the anticommuting pentad arrangement, involving a complexified vector-quaternion 
algebra, this would be impossible. 

The nilpotent wavefunctions have the advantage of automatically introducing second 
quantization, because both the differential operator and the wavefunction are quantized to 
the same degree. Second quantization is a reflection of the duality in the underlying group 

 

24 

structure.  (It  also  reflects  the  fact  that  the  nilpotent  wavefunction  incorporates  both 
‘Heisenberg’ and ‘Schrödinger’ elements, in the respective terms (± kE ± ii p + ij m) and     
e-i(Et - p.r).) Pauli exclusion is an immediate consequence of the formulation, as the product of 
two identical fermion  wavefunctions is  necessarily zero. For  the  same reason, nilpotency 
automatically  leads  to  nonlocal  correlation  between  all  fermion  states  (because  all  must 
‘know’ immediately that none is identical to any other), at the same time as it requires time-
delayed local interactions between particle states by being the square root of a relativistic 
energy conservation equation. 

The scalar product of two identical states, in the nilpotent formulation, is necessarily 
zero. If, however, we reverse the signs of either kE or ii p or both in one of the two states, 
we will immediately produce a nonzero scalar product, such as a multiple of E2 + p2 − m2, or 
−E2  +  p2 −  m2, when we sum up over the four solutions representing the states. A vector 
boson (spin = 1) has fermion and antifermion components with the same sign of p, but the 
opposite sign of E. So its wavefunction incorporates a scalar product of the form: 
 

 
whose sum is a nonzero scalar, 4 (E2 + p2 + m2) = 8 E2, before normalization. A scalar boson 
(spin = 0), however, has components with p terms of opposite signs. Hence its wavefunction 
incorporates a scalar product of the form: 
 

(kE + ii p + ij m) (−kE + ii p + ij m) ; 
(kE − ii p + ij m) (−kE − ii p + ij m) ; 
(−kE + ii p + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) ; 
(−kE − ii p + ij m) (kE − ii p + ij m) . 

(kE + ii p + ij m) (−kE − ii p + ij m) ; 
(kE − ii p + ij m) (−kE + ii p + ij m) ; 
(−kE + ii p + ij m) (kE − ii p + ij m) ; 
(−kE − ii p + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) , 
 

(kE + ii p + ij m) (kE − ii p + ij m) ; 
(kE − ii p + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) ; 
(−kE + ii p + ij m) (−kE −  ii p + ij m) ; 
(−kE − ii p + ij m) (−kE + ii p + ij m) , 

which  is,  again,  a  scalar,  4  (E2  −  p2  +  m2)  =  8  m2,  before  normalization,  while  a  Bose-
Einstein condensate wavefunction incorporates a scalar product which is the sum of: 
 

 
which  is  the  scalar  4  (−E2  −  p2  +  m2)  =  −8  p2,  before  normalization.  In  the  case  of 
correlations between wavefunctions of noninteracting fermions, say, (kE1 + ii p1 + ij m1), 

 

25 

(kE2  +  ii  p2  +  ij  m2),  etc,  we  clearly  obtain  a  bosonic  state  for  an  even  number  of 
wavefunctions, and a fermionic state for an odd number. 

The nilpotent operators are also creation and annihilation operators and equivalent to 
the quantum field integrals acting on the vacuum state. The Q generator for supersymmetry, 
converting bosons to fermions, is simply the term (kE + iip + ijm), while Q† = (–kE + iip + 
ijm) converts bosons to antifermions, or fermions to bosons, assuming, of course, that the 
full operators are four-term bra or ket vectors, with the E and p values going through the 
usual  cycle  of  +  and  –  values.  The  nilpotent  formulation  shows  clearly  the  relationship 
between spin and statistics between the particle types. The fermion wavefunction is a single 
nilpotent,  a  square-root  of  the  zero  squared-energy  term.  The  spin  ½  term  comes 
immediately from the square-rooting operation. The boson wavefunction, on the other hand, 
is  a  nonzero  scalar  product  of  two  nilpotents,  and  combines  two  spin  ½  terms  into  an 
integral multiple. The square-rooting introduces the noncommutativity of the wavefunction 
and Pauli exclusion at the same time as it introduces the factor ½ into the spin. In fact, it 
uses the same mathematical procedure. 

Square-rooting the energy equation also introduces discreteness (the fermion, with rest 
mass)  with  a  continuous  variation  (the  kinetic  energy).  The  factor  2  which  appears  so 
frequently in fundamental physics can nearly always be expressed in terms of a transition 
between discreteness and continuity, and is, in this sense, a direct expression of the duality 
of the group  structure.10  The  other  dualities  (real  /  imaginary,  conserved / nonconserved) 
have the same effect – complexification, for example, introduces discreteness in the creation 
of the Dirac  pentad. The  factor 2  is  also  an expression of dimensionality, as can be seen 
from the fact that it arises in the square rooting of the energy-squared term. It is significant 
that  complex  and  quaternionic  factors  only  appear  in  the  linear  form,  and  never  in  the 
squared form used in Pythagorean-type addition. 

The fact that p is a 3-component quantity means that it is possible to have a fermion-
like  3-component  nilpotent  wavefunction  representing  a  single  quantum  mechanical 
(baryon)  system;  such  possibilities  also  derive  directly  from  the  pentad  algebra.  Baryon 
wavefunctions  constructed  from  nilpotents  use  the  three-dimensional  properties  of  the  p 
operator,  by  representing  the  six degrees  of freedom for the spin as  ±  p1, ±  p2, ±  p3, and 
assuming that each one of these represents a phase of the interaction between the three quark 
components. Then an expression of the form 

 

                            (kE ± ii p1 + ij m) (kE ± ii p2 + ij m) (kE ± ii p3+ ij m) , 
 
by  successively  taking  p  through  each  of  the  phases,  incorporates  all  six  terms  in  the 
antisymmetric colour singlet of SU(3): 
 
                              ψ ~ (BGR – BRG + GRB – GBR + RBG – RGB) .

A vacuum operator may also be constructed from nilpotents in the form of a diagonal 
matrix, premultiplied by a 4-component row state vector or postmultiplied by a 4-component 
column state vector, representing a fermion state. In the first case, we write: 
 
              ( (−kE − iip + ijm)  (−kE + iip + ijm) (kE − iip + ijm) (kE + iip + ijm)) ×

assuming  the  appropriate  normalisation  constants.  When  applied  to  a  row  vector,  the 
vacuum  operator  is  always  k  ×  matrix  form  of  state  vector  for  the  fermion.  The  order  is 
reversed when applied to a column vector. 

For a single fermion interacting with the vacuum, we can imagine an infinite series of 
terms of the form (kE + iip + ijm), (kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm), (kE + ikp + ijm) (–kE 
+ iip + ijm)( kE + iip + ijm), (kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm)( kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + 
ijm), etc., allowing a cancellation of the boson and fermion loops of opposite sign in a kind 
of natural supersymmetry without  additional  particles.  To convert bosons to fermions we 
multiply by (kE + iip + ijm). To convert bosons to antifermions, or fermions to bosons, we 
multiply by (–kE + iip + ijm). In addition, (kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm) (kE + iip + 
ijm)( –kE + iip + ijm) ... is the same as (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) 
k (kE + iip + ijm) ... , which expresses the repeated action of the fermion state (kE + iip + 
ijm) on the vacuum state k (kE + iip + ijm). The nilpotent representation of point fermions, 
creating  an  infinite  series  of  further  nilpotents  in  the  continuous  vacuum,  suggests  a 
connection with topos theory, as we have previously stated. In this connection, it may be of 
significance that the relativistic time-space-proper time combination can also be considered 
as a Dirac nilpotent (kt + iir + ijτ). (It may be thought of as a 3-D ‘time’ comparable to the 
3-D ‘mass’ represented by (kE + iip + ijm), and opposed to the 1-D ‘charge’ and ‘space’ 
created by the single well-defined direction for quantized angular momentum.)  

The  nilpotent  wavefunctions  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  why  scalar  bosons 
cannot  be  massless  and  why  Goldstone  bosons  are  unphysical.  They  allow  an  easy 
calculation  of  the  fine  structure  terms  for  the  hydrogen  atom,  of  the  strong  interaction 
potential (including both the linear potential and the Coulomb term), of the parity states for 
mesons and baryons, and of propagators for the electromagnetic and other interactions. C, P 
and T transformations may be performed by a simple operation of the respective quaternion 
units j, i, k, which shows their connections. The quantum field integrals acting on vacuum 

 

27 

are immediately reduced to single nilpotent operators.18-26 The fermion propagator may be 
defined without the infrared divergences, while the self-energy of the electron necessarily 
results in a finite sum.26 

 

15 The creation of the Dirac state 

 
The Dirac state arises from the fact that the four fundamental parameters, time, space, 
mass, charge are characterized by the respective algebraic units i, i, j, k, 1, i, j, k. However, 
the fundamental units of the algebra which this entails are created from an anticommuting 
pentad, with specific rules concerning the two 3-dimensional arrangements, i, j, k, i, j, k, 
which are subunits of the general algebra. In reducing the 8 pure units to 5 composite ones, 
we are constrained by the algebra to map one of them onto the other three parameters. So, 
we  may  choose  to map charge onto space,  time  and mass,  with  each  of the three  charge 
terms w, s, e, each taking one of the parameters. The composite algebra which emerges is of 
the form ki, ii, ij, ii, j, and is isomorphic to the Dirac algebra, though, in creating the Dirac 
pentads, we have multiplied by an extra i for operational convenience. Diagrammatically, 
we can represent the process as follows:

Physically, by putting quantized charge components onto time, space and mass units, 
we introduce quantization to the composite terms, and, since the charges are also conserved 
quantities, we create a quantum state with fixed E, p, m. The concept of ‘rest mass’ emerges 
only in this act of ‘quantization’. At the same time, the three charges, by being associated 
with quantities with different mathematical properties (pseudoscalar, vector and real scalar), 

 

28 

also  take  on  physical  characteristics  associated  with  these  quantities,  thus  breaking  the 
symmetry  between  them.  The  symmetry  between  the  weak,  strong  and  electromagnetic 
interactions is thus broken in the creation of the Dirac state. 27-30 

It is important to stress that the application of quaternion operators in the expression 
(ikE  +  ip  +  jm)  or  (kE  +  iip  +  ijm)  does not  in itself create the Dirac  state,  as  the  same 
algebraic expression could be used in a purely mathematical factorization of the classical 
special relativistic energy-momentum expression. It is the equating of these operators to the 
three fundamental charge units, with their properties of quantization and conservation, that 
creates the Dirac state by restructuring the meaning of the terms to which they are applied as 
quantized  and  conserved  ones.  This  process,  as  we  shall  see,  implies  the  direct  relation 
between  conservation  of  charge  and  conservation  of  angular  momentum  which  we  have 
predicted must exist purely on the grounds of symmetry. 

The Dirac pentad is the largest possible anti-commuting set, and there are exactly six 
such sets in the algebra.31 One can always map the gamma algebra to a double-quaternion 
algebra  by  defining  a  triad  of  anti-commuting  numbers  (there  are  60  such  sets)  as  a 
quaternion set, then calculating the conjugate triad (another quaternion set) which commutes 
with  the  original  triad  (there  are  30  such  triad  pairs).  Such  a  pair  is  then  the  double-
quaternion (or quaternion  / vector) set, which gives the 3 quaternion, 3 vector, 9 product 
algebra. It can be shown that, no matter how such as triad pair is chosen, every pentad must 
contain two members of one triad, while the remaining three terms are the product of the 
third member of the triad with each member of the conjugate triad. 

The  symmetry  breaking  occurs  when  the  conjugate  triads  are  chosen.  In  the  general 
algebra, one is never required to define any triads as privileged, therefore the algebra has 5-
dimensional global symmetry. However, once a triad is chosen, the conjugate triad is also 
uniquely  defined.  It  is  this  choice  which  breaks  the  global  symmetry,  and  allows  one  to 
define the SU(3). 
 
16 SU(3) 
 

The SU(3) symmetry for the strong interaction arises from the vector nature of the term 
p  in  the  nilpotent  wavefunction.  The  baryon-type  state  vector,  with  three  components 
splitting the three independent components of p, is the only nonzero alternative to the usual 
fermion nilpotent. The SU(3) symmetry then becomes a straightforward expression of gauge 
invariance  or  the  perfect  symmetry  between  all  the  possible  phases.  The  conventional 
expression for this symmetry requires a covariant derivative of the form:

The physical interpretation of this representation is that the three quark ‘colours’ in the 
baryon are as inseparable as the three dimensions of space and that they stem from exactly 
the  same  origin.  All  ‘phases’  of  the  strong  interaction  are  present  at  the  same  time,  and 
equally  probable,  and,  if  we  arbitrarily  isolate  one  phase,  the  carrier  of  the  ‘colour’ 
component of the interaction (igs λα Aα / 2), or the strong charge (s), will be ‘transferred’, at 
a constant rate, to create the next phase at the same time as the spin (in the p term); and the 
current effecting the ‘transfer’ will be carried by the gluons or generators of the strong field. 
The  ‘transfer’  of  strong  charge  or  ‘colour’  field,  which  we  describe  as  the  ‘strong 
interaction’, is an expression of the innate gauge invariance of the SU(3) representation of 
the  three-part  baryon  wavefunction,  and  simultaneously  of  the  conservation  of  the 
directional aspect of angular momentum. The interaction, which derives entirely from the 
nilpotent structure of the baryon wavefunction, will necessarily be nonlocal, and the constant 
rate  of  momentum  or  angular momentum ‘transfer’,  will produce a force which does not 
depend on the physical separation of the components. Mathematically, this requires a linear 
potential for the strong force, with an additional Coulomb component needed for spherical 
symmetry.24 
 
17 SU(2)L × U(1) 
 

The conservation properties of the weak and electromagnetic charges appear also to be 
determined by  those of  the angular  momentum operator,  and, in the case of a quark-type 
arrangement, might be expected to operate the same system of ‘privileging’ one charge in 
three  during  the  complete  phase  cycle  (with  only  one  component  of  angular momentum 
well-defined).  The weak  and electric  charges,  however, are not directly attached to the p 
operator, like the strong charge, and so their ‘privileged’ phases will not necessarily coincide 
with that of the strong charge or with each other. One of these charges (w) is attached to E 
and the other (e) to m, and it is the combination of these which affects p. For this reason we 
tend to think of the electric and weak forces as being in some way combined. But these two 
charges  are  governed  by  quite  separate  symmetries.  The  charge  represented  by  the 
quaternion label k (which we call w) produces two sign options for iE, because the algebra 
demands  complexification  of  E,  and  there  are  necessarily  two  mathematical  solutions. 
Physically, only positive energy exists, because mass-energy is required by the fundamental 
group symmetry to be a continuum; but the status of the quaternion labels as square roots of 
–1 permits charge conjugation or reversal of the signs of the quaternion labels. So the –ikE 
states  are  interpreted  as  antifermion  or  charge-conjugated  states;  and  the  mass-energy 
continuum becomes a filled k or weak vacuum for the ground state of the universe, in which 
such states would not exist. 

The filled vacuum is specifically a weak vacuum. It manifests itself through a violation 
of charge conjugation symmetry for the weak interaction, with consequent violation of either 
time reversal symmetry or parity. Effectively, this means that, though the weak interaction 

 

31 

can tell the difference between particle and antiparticle, it cannot distinguish between + and 
– signs of weak charge. Where s charges are present, the signs of the w and s charges are 
linked, though, ideally, they should be independent. A degree of freedom has been removed; 
and both quarks and free fermions become mixed states, containing +w, and suppressed –w, 
states,  and  involving  respective  violations  of  parity  and  time  reversal  symmetry.  The 
removal,  here,  of  a  degree  of  freedom  from  the  charges  ±  w  ±  s  ±  e  coincides  with  the 
acquisition  of  a  degree  of  freedom  by  E  ±  p;  in  each  case  the  sign  of  the  k  operator 
determines  that  the  Dirac  state  has  the  four  solutions  which  result  from  its  quaternionic 
structure and its 4-D space-time producing the unique 2D/2 × 2D/2 matrix representation of the 
Clifford algebra, and, in each case, it requires a filled vacuum relating to the k term.32 

A violation of parity or time reversal symmetry, consequent upon a violation of charge 
conjugation, means that only one state of σ.p exists for the pure w interaction for fermions, 
Because (according to the Dirac equation) σ = –1, this is the state of negative helicity or left-
handedness. The creation of the alternative states of positive helicity or right-handedness, 
which are required by the existence of –p in our formalism, then demands the introduction 
of mass. In the nilpotent version of the Dirac state, this is associated with the j quaternion 
label, which defines what we call the electric charge. The presence of m thus simultaneously 
mixes E and p terms, right-handed and left-handed components, and the effects of e and w 
charges. 

The existence of separate conservation laws for w, s, and e charges means that each type 
of  charge  must  be  independent  of  the  other.  The  characteristic  SU(2)L  ‘isospin’  pattern 
associated with the weak interaction is an expression of the independence of the weak force 
from  the  presence  or  absence  of  electric  charges.  (The  electromagnetic  U(1)  term  is,  of 
course, purely a required phase.) The weak interaction must be both uniquely left-handed for 
fermion  states  and  indifferent  to  the  presence  or  absence  of  the  electric  charge,  which 
introduces the right-handed element. The SU(2) produces a quantum number, t3, such that 
(t3)2 = (½)2 in half the total number of possible states, that is, in the left-handed ones. For 
free fermions, the quantum number for the electric force becomes the presence or absence of 
the electric charge (in the same way as it is the presence or absence of mass). That is, we 
take  0  and  –1  as  the  quantum  numbers  (Q)  (equivalent  to  the  charges  0  and  –e)  for  the 
absence  and  presence of  electric charge (and mass), the  –  sign  being purely historical  in 
origin, and the + sign being reserved for antistates; and so Q2 = 1 in half the total number of 
possible  states (including the right-handed  ones).  The key  electroweak  mixing parameter 
then becomes sin2θW = Σ (t3)2 / Σ Q2 = 0.25. 

The weak interaction also has to be indifferent to the presence or absence of the strong 
charge, that is, to the directional state of the angular momentum operator, and so the same 
mixing proportion must exist also for quark states, and separately for each ‘colour’, so that 
none is preferred. Applying this specifically to quarks, we have the same weak isospin states 
for one lepton-like ‘colour’ (that is –1 and 0, or –e and 0), but we also find that the only 
corresponding  isospin  states  for  the  other  colours  that  retain  both  the  accepted  value  of 

 

32 

sin2θW and the variation of only one ‘privileged’ quark phase ‘instantaneously’ in three, are 
1  and  0  (or  e  and  0).  In  effect,  we  take  the  variation  0  0  –e  against  either  an  empty 
background or ‘vacuum’ (0 0 0) or a full background (e e e), so that the two states of weak 
isospin in the three colours become: 
 
 
 
 

0 
–e  . 

e 
0 

e 
0 

With  the  pattern  of  SU(3)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)  established  from  first  principles  for  the 
strong, weak and electric interactions between fermions, we can, of course, use the already-
established  formalisms  relating  to  these  symmetries  to  derive  Lagrangians,  generators, 
covariant derivatives, and so on, and can extend the reasoning applied to the wavefunctions 
for SU(3) to those used for SU(2)L × U(1). Our immediate concern, here, however, will be to 
derive charge structures for the fundamental particles.27-30,33-5 
 
18 The charge structures of quarks and leptons 

 
Fermions (or quarks and leptons) are states characterized by the presence of the weak 
charge, and the number and structure of all possible fermion states is determined absolutely 
by  the  enumeration  of  all  particle  states  which  are  indistinguishable  from  each  other  in 
terms  of  the  weak  interaction.  The  weak  interaction  cannot  tell,  in  principle,  whether  a 
strong interaction is also operating, and so particles with strong charges (quarks) ought to be 
indistinguishable by this interaction from particles without strong charges (leptons). In the 
case of quarks, it cannot tell the difference between a filled ‘electromagnetic vacuum’ (weak 
isospin  up  state)  and  an  empty  one  (weak  isospin  down  state).  The  weak  interaction,  in 
addition, is also indifferent to the sign of the weak charge, and responds (via the vacuum) 
only to the status of fermion or antifermion; this produces mixing between the respective 
fermion generations, defined with +w, with –w and P violation, and with –w and T violation. 
From these sets of equally probable states (excluding energy considerations), we define all 
the possible distinctions between fermion / antifermion; quark / lepton; isospin up / isospin 
down;  and  the  three  quark-lepton  generations.  The  distinctions  are  made  in terms  of the 
other charges (s and e), and of mass. 

A  representation  of  this  process  can  be  made  in  terms  of  conservation  of  angular 
momentum, which we have already associated with the conservation of each of the charges. 
If we take σ.p^ (or – σ.p^, using the historically-established sign conventions for charges) as 
equivalent  in  unit  charge  terms  to  an  expression  in  which  p^  becomes  the  unit  vector 
components p^1, p^2, p^3, in successive phases of the strong interaction, and apply this to the 
strong  charge  quaternion  operator  i,  the  units  of  strong  charge  will  become  0i  or  1i, 
depending on the supposed instantaneous direction of the angular momentum vector. Only 
one  component  of a baryon will  have this unit at  any instant. In reality, of course, gauge 

 

33 

invariance ensures that all possible phases exist at once, so spin becomes a property of the 
entire system and not of the component quarks. 

The  same  angular  momentum  term  (σ.p^)  carries  the  information  concerning  the 
conservation of the other two charge terms, and, in effect, the three charges are separately 
conserved  because  they  represent  three  different  aspects  of  the  angular  momentum 
conservation process. In the case of the weak and electric charges, the random unit vector 
components p^1, p^2, p^3, are associated respectively with the sign, and the magnitude of the 
angular momentum state, through the connections of p with E and p with m. We can, in fact, 
generalise the procedure by applying σ.p^1, σ.p^2, σ.p^3 to the quaternion operators (k and j) 
specifying w and e, but with the sequence of unit vectors determined separately in each case. 
It is then the various alignments between the sequences of unit vectors or phases applied to 
s, w and e which determine the nature of the fermion state produced. 

For example, if we align the unit vectors applied to w and e, we are effectively aligning 
the E and m phases with each other, and so necessarily with the p phase, which means that 
the system has a single phase and so cannot be baryonic. The p phase is defined with E and 
m, and there is no strong charge. We have thus defined a free fermion or lepton. In a baryon 
system, with strong charges present, the vectors assigned to the weak and electric charges, 
and hence to E and m, will not be aligned, and, consequently, the p phase is not fixed with 
respect to them. 

To  complete  the  representation  of  all  possible  fermions,  we  need  to  incorporate  the 
effect  of  weak  isospin and  the  parity-  and time-reversal-violation  of the  second and third 
generations.  Reversal  of  isospin  is  accomplished  by  replacing  a  term  such  as  –  jp^1  with        
–  j(p^1  –  1),  the  j1  representing  the  filled  ‘electric  vacuum’  state.  Charge  conjugation 
violation may be represented by the non-algebraic symbols zP and zT, depending on whether 
it is accompanied by P or T violation. In using these symbols, we are merely saying that we 
are treating the –w of the second and third generator as though it were positive in the same 
way as the w of the first generation. We can now express quark structures in the following 
form:

Here,  –j  represents  electric charge  (conventionally negative), i strong, k weak. a, b, c are 
each randomly 1, 2, 3, except that b ≠ c. Both – zPk and – zTk become equivalent to k, for the 
purposes of the weak interaction. For the corresponding leptons, the components are all in 
phase (p^a), and there is no directional component:

Both antiquarks and antileptons simply replace –σ with σ. 
 
19 Quarks and leptons 
 

From these formulae, the 0 and 1 charge structures of the fundamental fermions may be 
expressed in terms of a set of three ‘quark’ tables, A-C, with an extra table L for the left-
handed leptons and antileptons:

Applying  these  to  the  known  fermions,  A-C  would  appear  to represent  the coloured 
quark system,  with s  pictured as being ‘exchanged’ between the three states (although in 
reality, of course, all the states exist simultaneously), in the same way as the operator p in 
the  nilpotent baryon wavefunction. In  relation to these tables, we can look on symmetry-
breaking, in general, as a consequence of the setting up of the algebraic model for charges. 
When  we map  time, space and mass onto the charges w-s-e, to create the anticommuting 
Dirac pentad, only one charge (s) has the full range of vector options. ‘Fixing’ one of the 
others (say e) for s to vary against, gives us only 2 remaining options for w, unit on the same 
colour as e or unit on a different one. Putting both w and e on the same colour denies the 
necessary  three  degrees  of  freedom  in  the  direction  of  angular  momentum,  so  this  is 
forbidden in a quark system. In principle, there are also two other quark tables (D-E), but, 
with the application of the exclusion rules defined above, these both reduce to the lepton 
table L. The reduction from A-E to A-C plus L can be thought of as similar to a reduction 
from the full Dirac pentad to a 4-vector or quaternion representation.

An important aspect of this model is the fact that the charges (e, s, w) are irrotational, 
but  the  quaternion labels  (j, i, k) are not, and this has been used in previous work as the 
primary  derivation  of  the  tables.  Even  here,  E  appears  to  be  excluded  automatically  by 
requiring  all  three  quaternions  to  be  attached  to  specified  charges,  thus  losing  the  three 
required  degrees  of  rotational  freedom,  and,  at  the same time,  necessarily violating Pauli 
exclusion. Significantly, also, though the separate and random variation of p^a, p^b, and p^c, in 
a  quark-based  system  suggests  27  possible  variations  in  charge  structure,  the  number  of 
different outcomes is reduced by repetitions, and is five, as in the anticommuting pentads of 
the  Dirac  algebra.  Effectively,  we  ‘privilege’  one  of  p^a,  p^b,  p^c,  by  allowing  it  complete 
variation  with  respect  to  the  others;  p^b  is  the  one  selected,  and  it  corresponds  to  the 
‘privileging’ of p as a vector term with full variation in the Dirac anticommuting pentad. 

 
 

38 

In  its  most  compact  form,  the  entire  set  of  charge  structures  for  fermions  and 

antifermions may be derived from a single expression: 
 
                               σz.(i p^a (δbc – 1) + j (p^b – 1δ0m) + k p^c (−1)δ1g g) 
 
Here,  σz  is  the  spin pseudovector component  defined in  the z  direction;  and the units of 
quantized angular momentum, p^a, p^b, p^c are selected randomly and independently from the 
three  orthogonal  components  p^x,  p^y,  p^z.  Each  of  the  other  operators  creates  one  of  the 
fundamental divisions in fermionic structure – fermion / antifermion; quark / lepton (colour); 
weak  up  isospin  /  weak  down  isospin;  and  the  three  generations  –  which  are  identified, 
respectively,  by  the  weak,  strong,  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  interactions.  σz  = –1 
defines left-handed states; σz = 1 defines right-handed. Assuming a filled weak vacuum, left-
handed states become predominantly fermionic, while right-handed states are antifermionic 
‘holes’ in the vacuum. b = c produces leptons; b ≠ c produces quarks. Taking into account 
all three directions at once, when b ≠ c, we define baryons composed of three quarks (and 
mesons  composed  of  quark  and  antiquark),  in  which  each  of  a,  b,  c  cycle  through  the 
directions x, y, z. 

m is an electromagnetic mass unit, which selects the state of weak isospin. It becomes 1 
when  the mass is  present and  0 it is when absent. The unit condition can be taken as an 
empty electromagnetic vacuum; the zero condition a filled one. g represents a conjugation of 
weak  charge  units,  with  g  =  –1  meaning  maximal  conjugation.  If  conjugation  fails 
maximally, then g = 1. g can also be taken as a composite term, containing a parity element 
(P) and a time-reversal element (T), providing two ways for the conjugated PT to remain at 
the unconjugated value (1). g = –1 produces the generation u, d, νe, e; g = 1, with P violated, 
produces c, s, νµ, µ; g = 1, with T violated, produces t, b, ντ, τ. 

The charge conjugation from –w  to  w, in  the second and  third  generations,  which  is 
represented in the tables by zP or zT, is brought about by the filled weak vacuum needed to 
avoid negative energy states. The two weak isospin states are associated with this idea, the 1 
in  (p^b  –  1δ0m)  being  a  ‘filled’  state,  with  its  absence  an  unfilled  state,  and  the  weak 
interaction  acts by annihilating and  creating  e, either  filling  the  vacuum  or emptying it –
which is why, unlike the strong interaction, it always involves the equivalent of particle + 
antiparticle = particle + antiparticle, and involves a massive intermediate boson. We thus 
create two possible vacuum states to allow variation of the sign of electric charge by weak 
isospin, and this variation is linked to the filling of the vacuum which occurs in the weak 
interaction. The weak and electric interactions are linked by this filled vacuum in the SU(2)L 
× U(1) model, as they are in our description of weak isospin, and we can regard these as 
alternative  formalisms  for  representing  the  same  physical  truth.  It  is  significant  that  the 
Higgs mechanism for generating masses of intermediate weak bosons and fermions requires 
the same Higgs vacuum field both for SU(2)L and for U(1).

20 Conservation of type of charge and conservation of angular momentum 

 
In generating the particle charge structures, we have established the connection between 
the conservation of the type of charge and the conservation of angular momentum, which 
emerges  from  the  fundamental  symmetry  of  space,  time,  mass  and  charge.  Each  type  of 
charge  (strong,  weak  and  electromagnetic)  is  related  to  a  separate  aspect  of  angular 
momentum  conservation  (direction,  orientation  (sign),  and  magnitude).  The  angular 
momentum  operator  in  the  nilpotent  is  also  vital  to  the  meaning  of  quantum  mechanics 
itself,  as  it  effectively  defines  the  classical  /  quantum  transition.  Real  physical  processes 
involve discrete energy transfer between discrete charged or massive particles. In quantum 
mechanical  terms,  discrete  energy  transfer  involves  collapse  of  the  wavefunction.  This 
collapse may be  considered as a change which breaks the direct connection between the 
conservation  laws  of  type  of  charge  and  angular  momentum.  Where  the  connection  is 
maintained in a coherent way, even on a large scale, we have quantum mechanics. Where it 
is  not, we  have  decoherence through the vector addition of the noncoherent individual p 
components, and, therefore, energy transfer. (If the p terms remain aligned, there is no need 
to alter E.) The same also applies for a change of charge structure or rest mass state. The 
level of decoherence is measured by the increase in entropy (or the number of noncoherent 
states), and any process involving an interaction between two fermions will involve some 
measure of it. In practical terms, making a classical measurement means the application of 
fields  of  sufficient  size  to  make  the  whole  system  decohere  and  reduce  any  quantum 
mechanical variation in spatial coordinates during a given time interval to the level of the 
uncertainty principle. 

 

21 The lepton-like quark model 
 

It  seems  evident,  from  the  algebraic  representation,  that  the  most  appropriate 
mathematical model to represent quarks is an extension of the integrally-charged coloured 
quark  model,  originally  proposed  by Han and  Nambu  in  1965, and  operating to  produce 
observed  fractional  charges  in  much  the  same  way  as  the  parallel  phenomenon  of  the 
fractional  quantum  Hall  effect  in  condensed  matter  physics.36  In  a  fully  gauge  invariant 
theory of the strong interaction, with quark colours intrinsically inseparable, the underlying 
charges could easily be integral while always being perceived as fractional in effect at any 
energy.  With  perfect  gauge  invariance  between  the  coloured  phases,  and  hence  perfect 
infrared slavery (as our model requires), there will be no transition regime between implicit 
and explicit colour, and no finite energy range at which integral charges or colour properties 
will  emerge.  Observed  charges,  measured  by  quantum  electrodynamics,  will  be  exactly 
fractional at all energies. 

The  advantages  of  this  version  of  quark  structure  are  that  it  is  already  lepton-like, 
allowing for an easier unification of the two types of fermion; that it makes sin2θW = 0.25 for 

 

40 

both  leptons  and  quarks  (which  is  close  to  the  observed value); that  it predicts  an  exact 
Grand  Unification  of  all  four  forces  at  the  Planck  mass;  that  it  avoids  difficulties  of  the 
definition of a charge unit if both 2/3 and 1/3 are fundamental units; and that it produces two 
values  for  weak  hypercharge,  as  required,  when  the  Higgs  mechanism  is  applied  to  the 
creation of quark masses, and they are also the correct values (±1).30,35,37 A model based on 
real  fractional  charges does none of  these,  and it  fails also to  explain how a fermion can 
‘know’ whether it is a quark or a lepton by any means other than the strong interaction. 

The model also explains easily how mass is generated when an element of partial right-
handedness  is  introduced  into  an  intrinsically  left-handed  system.  In  principle,  anything 
which alters the signs of the terms in the expression (i p^a (δbc – 1) + j (p^b – 1δ0m) + k p^c 
(−1)δ1g  g),  or  reduces  any  of  these  terms  to  zero,  is  a  mass  generator,  because  it  is 
equivalent to introducing the opposite sign of σz or a partially right-handed state. Thus mass 
can  be  produced separately by  weak isospin,  by  quark confinement,  and by weak  charge 
conjugation violation. Various calculations have been made, using these mechanisms, of the 
masses of baryons and mesons, quarks and leptons. 2,4,27-8,30 

Using the tables A-C and L, we can explain many facts related to particle physics, and 
also  make  some  new  predictions.  For  example,  if  we  derive  baryon  and  meson  charge 
structures from those of the component quarks and antiquarks, we find that all baryons have 
a  weak  charge structure of  w, while  all  mesons have a weak  charge  structure  0, with the 
exception of states like the K mesons, and the other meson states combining a fermion and 
antifermion of two different generations. For these states, we find alternative weak charge 
structures of 0 or ± (1 + z)w, where z may be zP or zT. (Mesons combining the second and 
third generations will have structure combining zP and zT.) The alternatives depend on the 
particular  colour-anticolour  combination,  and  particular quark  representation, we choose. 
Clearly, 0 and ± (1 + z)w have to be indistinguishable in weak terms, but we have already 
broken a symmetry (either P or T) in creating z, which means that we are also obliged to 
break  another  to  maintain  overall  CPT  invariance.  In  the  case  of  a  bosonic  state,  charge 
conjugation must be preserved, so we are obliged to break CP (or T) as well as P, or CT (or 
P) as well as T. Our prediction is that such an additional violation will be found in all states 
of this kind.2,4 It has already been observed in Ko andKo mixed states, and is now known to 
occur  in  Ko  andKo,  taken  separately,  as  well  as  being  extended  to  incorporate  mesons 
combining first and third generation components. However, it should also be observable in 
−
K
, and in the equivalent states in other generations. It should also be observed in the 
weak  decays  of  Bose-Einstein condensates,  which  again involve a (1 + z)w, weak charge 
structure. 

+
 and K

Some other predictions may be made of a more quantitative nature. For example, from 
sin2θW  = 0.25 at  the  energy  of the Z0  boson (which theory suggests will measure slightly 
lower  if  it  involves  the  emergence  of  the  boson  itself),  we  derive  sin2θW  =  1  at  Grand 
Unification, and a Grand Unification energy equivalent to the Planck mass. This leads to a 
testable  prediction  for  1/α  at  118  at  14  TeV,  with  appropriate  variation  up  to  that 

 

41 

value.28,34,36 (This is measurably lower than the prediction of 125 at 14 TeV from minimal 
SU(5).) There are grounds (though much more tentative) for suggesting that the mass of the 
Higgs boson is of order 182 GeV or 2MZ, which suggests that the most favoured decay will 
be  via  2Z0  or  the  four  lepton  route.28,30,32-4  A  separate  prediction  of  an  accelerating 
cosmological redshift, with a deceleration parameter –1, follows from the gravitation-inertia 
interpretation of general relativity.12-13,23 
 
22 Grand unification 
 

The idea that the 5-fold Dirac algebra is responsible for the symmetry breaking which 
leads  to  the  SU(3)  ×  SU(2)L  ×  U(1)  splitting  in  the  interactions  between  fundamental 
particles, suggests that  Grand  Unification may  involve  the  SU(5)  group,  or even U(5).  In 
principle, we derive five representations of the electric, strong and weak charge states (A-E), 
which map onto the charge units (e, s, w), and the five quantities (m, p, E) involved in the 
Dirac  equation.20-1,28-30,37  The  24  SU(5)  generators  can  be  represented  in  terms  of  any  of 
these units, for example:

With  an  additional  25th  generator,  linking  all  the  colourless  and  charge-free  bosons 
along the diagonal, the group would become U(5). This generator, if it existed, would couple 
to all matter in proportion to the amount, and, as a colour singlet, would be ubiquitous. This 
is  a  precise  description  of  the  force  of  gravity,  and,  since  we  have  shown  that  Grand 
Unification of the electromagnetic, strong and weak forces occurs at the Planck mass, the 
energy  usually  taken  as  characteristic  of  quantum  gravity,  then  it  is  highly  probable  that 
U(5)  group  is  the  true  Grand  Unification  group,  and  that  it  also  incorporates  a  gravity 
generator – though most probably a spin 1 generator for the inertial reaction, rather than a 
spin 2, or other hypothetical, generator for gravity itself. 

The Planck mass is also the likely candidate for the cut-off energy which ensures the 
finite summation of fermion self-energies required by the nilpotent formulation. Through the 
need for a filled vacuum and the continuous nature of mass-energy, gravity is, we believe, 
the instantaneous carrier of the wavefunction correlations involved in nonlocality, and the 
Planck mass is the quantum of the inertial interactions, which we have elsewhere found to be 
the  result  of  the  effect  of  gravity  on  the  time-delayed  nature  of  nongravitational 
interactions.13-16 These in turn produce the inertial masses associated with charged particles, 
by a coupling to the Higgs field which fills the vacuum state.26 

A  U(5)  Grand  Unification  would  have  the  advantage  of  making  all  the  generators 
become pure phases, and identical in form, at the Grand Unification energy. The most likely 
possibility  (especially  if  it  concerns  the  inertial  reaction)  is  that  the  Grand  Unification 
energy would become a kind of ‘event horizon’, or unattainable limit, at which sin2θW would 
equal  1,  and  separate  conservation laws for charges  would  have  no  meaning. In  fact, the 
necessity  for  separate  conservation  would  prohibit  its  attainment,  as  it  already  prohibits 
direct proton decay. (The X and Y generators do not, we believe, imply direct proton decay, 
as they are linked to the particle + antiparticle mechanism of the ordinary weak interaction.) 
The five component terms of the Dirac pentad (E-p-m) are discrete, having become so 
in the process of superimposing the charges w, s, e on the original group parameters time, 
space  and  mass.  The  discreteness  may  be  thought  of,  in  some  sense,  as  being  due  to 
complexification. A nilpotent Dirac pentad is necessarily complex, and complexity is also 
necessary to fermions because the complex term ikE (occupying the same position in the 
formalism  as  w)  is  intrinsic  to  their  definition.  Complexity  creates  a  discontinuous  U(5) 
because in the E-p-m pentad we have a real quantized mass and an imaginary quantized E. 
The  group  is  also  U(5)  because  the  gravity  operator  (‘mass’)  has  been  automatically 
included in the process of ‘compactification’, or reduction of the eight original units (1, i, j, 
k,  i,  i,  j,  k)  to  the  five  composite  Dirac  terms  (ik,  ii,  ij,  ik,  j).  Complex  i  introduces 
discreteness  in  the  square-rooting  process  which  produces iE, and  this links up with the 
fermion / boson distinction.

23 The Dirac algebra operators and SU(5) generators 
 

Essentially, there are nine elements of the Dirac algebra which contain a vector and a 
quaternion  term  (and  another  nine  if  it  is  made  complex).  However,  the  32-part  algebra 
requires only five primitives, only three of which are vector quaternions. In principle, the 
system inevitably privileges one set of three out of the nine – only one quaternion is allowed 
to have a vector in the primitive set (leading to the behaviour of p and s). Where the system 
is complex, there seems also to be a requirement for some of the primitive terms to have a 
coefficient  of  imaginary  i  and  others  to  have  a  real  coefficient.  We  can  draw  up  the 
following multiplication table for the components of the algebra: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ik 
 
– iji 
– ijj 
– ijk

– ii

By comparison with the tables for the SU(5) generators, ii, ij, ik represents the strong 
charge in its three-colour form, j the electric charge, and ik the weak charge. The terms ± ii, 
± ij, ± ik represent the colour non-singlet gluons; ± ii the weak generators W+ and W–; and ± 
ki, ± kj, ± kk and ± iji, ± ijj, ± ijk the generators X and Y of the Grand Unified theory. All 
possible parts of the Dirac algebra are represented as either source terms or generators, if we 
take  no  account  of  the  complex  factor  i.  (It  is  notable  that  terms  appear  as  sources  or 
generators only with this factor or without it – there is no duplication, and the total number 
of possible outcomes remains 16.) The five zero-charge generators along the diagonal, the 
two colourless gluons, Z0, γ, and the gravity operator may be assumed completely mixed at 
Grand Unification in an overall U(5) structure. 

This is what happens if we assume the charge accommodation produces a complete one-
to-one correspondence with the Dirac algebra. If we now choose to construct a system for 
charge accommodation based on a double quaternion algebra (i.e. replacing the vector set i, 
j, k with a second, independent, quaternion set, using the same symbols), and, leaving out 
the i term entirely, we obtain the following:

This is closer to the charge accommodation algebra, which is based on a quaternion-

vector system. If we use a quaternion-vector system, as such, we obtain:

This has the advantage of making all the diagonal terms identical, as we would require. 
Also, all the pure vector terms become complex, while the pure quaternion terms and the 
vector quaternion terms are not, which creates a greater degree of uniformity in the algebra. 
In  this  case,  ii,  ij,  ik  represents  the  strong  charge  in  its  three-colour  form,  j  the  electric 
charge, and k the weak charge. The terms ± ii, ± ij, ± ik represent the colour non-singlet 
gluons;  ±  i  the  weak  generators  W+  and  W–;  and  ±  ki,  ± kj,  ± kk  and ±  ji, ±  jj, ± jk  the 
generators X and Y of the Grand Unified theory. It is significant now that the strong charge is 
represented by a quaternion i, which is ‘privileged’, by taking on the vector operators i, j, k, 
but that the same quaternion, without the vector operators, represents the weak interacting 
generators,  W+  and  W–;  while  the  colour  non-singlet  gluons  are  represented  by  complex 
pseudovectors,  exactly  as  they  are  when  represented  as  carried  by  the  spin  angular 
momentum. 

Another possibility is to use a vector quaternion algebra which is close to the charge-

accommodation form:

The  s-p  connection  provides  a  dynamical  model  of  quarks  using  integral  charges 
because, in all these case, the vector element in the mapping is preserved, irrespective of the 
sign.  This  is  what  makes  it  possible  to  write  down  a  baryon  wavefunction  in  terms  of  a 
‘rotating’ p.

The remaining 20 rows and columns are the products of the four pentads (ki, kj, kk, ij, 
i); ( iii, iij, iik, ik, j); ( iji, ijj, ijk, ii, k); ( iki, ikj, ikk, ij, i). The full group has 64 elements, 
constructed from the positive and negative versions of the 32 algebra units. For convenience, 
the multiplications of the negative elements are not shown, but the multiplications of two 
negative  elements  will  generate  the  same  products  as  the multiplications  of two  positive 
elements, while the multiplications of positive with negative elements, in either order, will 
generate the same products as two positive elements, if subsequently multiplied by –1. From 
the table it is clear that the 32-part algebra may be constructed from 1, i, and six independent 
Dirac  pentads,  which  double  to  twelve  with  the  signs  reversed. Within  each  pentad,  it is 
possible to observe the eight SU(3) generators and the four generators for SU(2)L × U(1), as 
outlined in the earlier part of this section. 

In  the  table,  the  ‘canonical’  pentad  (ii,  ij,  ik,  ik,  j),  obtained  by  priveleging  the  i 
quaternion operator, representing strong charge, is followed by two further pentads, obtained 
by  cycling  the  quaternion  operators  and  successively  privileging  j  and  k,  the  operators 
representing the electromagnetic and weak charges. This demonstrates that the SU(5) / U(5) 

47 

arrangement of the ‘quark’ tables A-E represents three interlocking SU(3) systems for the 
three interactions, of which only one may be privileged as the physical carrier of the vector 
aspect of angular momentum conservation. The existence of three further pentads, in which 
complex  quaternion  operators  replace  vectors,  and  vectors  replace  quaternions,  is  a 
consequence of the fact that our original creation of the Dirac algebra privileged the vectors 
by allowing them to retain their perfect symmetry at the expense of the quaternion operators. 
Mathematically,  however,  it  would  have  been  just  as  valid  to  privilege  the  quaternion 
operators at the expense of the vectors. 

As a further example of pentad structure, it may be that the 5-fold symmetry of Penrose 
tiling can be related to the Dirac algebra, as it derives from combinations of two types of 4-
sided figures: darts and kites. Each of these is an equilateral triangle, with one of the sides 
having a kink, either inwards or outwards, to produce the fourth vertex. In principle, this is 
based on 2 types of 3+1, and there may be a connection with quaternions and 4-vectors. The 
combination tends to produce figures with 5 or a multiple of 5 vertices on the outside. It is 
possible that there is a connection between this and the eight parts of space, time, mass and 
charge  becoming  the  five  of  Dirac  energy-momentum-mass.  The  7-D  mapping  with  7 
possible  neighbourhoods  for  the  tiling  patterns  may  relate  to  the  imaginary  part  of  an 
octonion-type structure. It may also be relevant that Penrose tiling is fractal, as is the infinite 
series of pentad vacuum ‘images’ produced by a fermion. 
 
24 Superspace and higher symmetries 
 

We have seen that the whole set of groups relevant to the foundations of physics comes 
from the fundamental concept of duality, which is effectively the same thing as applying a 
C2  symmetry  to  the  idea  of  physical  measurement,  and  which  has  direct  expression  in 
physical equations through the numerical factor 2. The symmetry group of the parameters 
develops from three C2 symmetries, and extends to higher symmetries on application of the 
specific mathematical forms applicable to these dualities. Successive applications of the real 
/  imaginary  and  discrete  /  continuous  (or  unidimensional  /  multidimensional)  divisions 
between the parameters space, time, mass and charge leads to a fundamental group of order 
64  (the  Dirac  algebra)  applicable  to  the  symmetry  of  an  object.  At  the  same  time,  the 
application  of  the  conserved  /  nonconserved  properties  also  produces  the  concept  of 
rotational  symmetry,  which,  applied  to  the  multidimensionality  which  derives  from  the 
discrete / continuous division, introduces a related set of Lie algebras, specified by a finite 
number of generators rather than elements, including the subgroups of G2, which relate to 
the Standard Model. It may be that we can continue to find meaning by doubling beyond this 
stage, and using the Freudenthal-Tits Magic Square. It is even possible that the doubling is 
open-ended, like that in Newton’s third law, or the ‘supersymmetric’ creation in the vacuum 
of  infinite  numbers  of  fermionic  and  bosonic states. It may even be  their  actual  physical 
representation. 

 

48 

Using  the  Magic  Square,  which  includes  the  5  unique  order  8  abstract  groups,  or 
exceptional Lie groups, generated by the octonions, we may extend our analysis to groups 
such  as  E6  and  E8, which have particularly  interesting characteristics for physical theory. 
8  or  3  ×  3 Hermitian octonionic matrix representations of the complexified E6, for 
The  M3
instance (or E6 × U(1), with U(1) representing the phase term), which Gürsey et al have seen 
as  a  possible  grand  unification  group  uniting quarks and  leptons,38-40  have 27  degrees  of 
freedom,  which  is  comparable  with  the  27  possible  particle  tables  of  the  form  A-E. The 
group E8, on the other hand, with 256 generators, 8 of which are ‘timelike’, which may be 
needed  to  complete  the  set  of  octonion-related  symmetries,  has  connections  with 
supersymmetry  and  string  theories,  and  so  it  is  particularly  interesting that  it  is a natural 
product of the hierarchies created by space, time, mass and charge. The real 8 × 8 matrices 
of E8 could possibly be isomorphic to the complex 4 × 4 matrices of the Dirac group. 

In supersymmetry theories, the vacuum has zero energy if the symmetry is unbroken; in 
the  present  case  the  symmetry-breaking  is  due  to  the  Dirac  /  Higgs  mechanism,  which 
privileges +E states over –E. It is probably very significant that the superspace needed for 
supersymmetry postulates four antisymmetric coordinates as superpartners of space-time – 
these look very like the mass and three charges of the present theory. The eight coordinates 
together  provide  a  superspace,  which  is  like  the  nilpotent  Dirac  algebra  or  double 
quaternions.  Perhaps  significantly,  E-p-m  (or  t-r-τ)  and  w-s-e  together  provide  a  10-
dimensional possibility, the eleventh dimension of string theory being introduced to embed 
the 10-D required in an observable structure, like the 2-D needed to draw a line in space. 

The  present  model  does  not  need  explanation  in  terms  of  string  theory,  but  it  may 
explain how such theories are generated, and perhaps produce new results at higher levels. 
The  most  popular  group  representation  for  the  superstrings  which  are  generalizations  of 
supersymmetry is  E8  × E8. In  this representation one  E8  forms  the  SU(3)  × SU(2)  × U(1) 
symmetry, while the other E8 set is assumed to be gravitational terms. We can speculate on 
the possibility of deriving all four forces from one set, with the other being a mirror set, thus 
connecting  the  real  /  virtual particle symmetry  outlined  in this  paper to  the  formalism  of 
string theory. Perhaps one set may represent space (3), time, mass, charge (3), combined as 
in t-r-τ, and quantized via the charge input, and the other set Dirac momentum (3), Dirac 
energy, Dirac rest mass, and Dirac angular momentum (3). The second set contains all the 
conserved  quantities  related  to  mass,  which  may  be  connected  to  the  association  of  the 
second  E8  with  gravity  –  conservation  of  charge  and  angular  momentum  rotational  / 
irrotational  properties  are  certainly related,  as we have seen,  in the same way as those of 
space are related to momentum, and those of energy to time. Mass, also, is split between the 
two sets, the source being in one, and the ‘field’ being in the other, and this would seem to 
be in agreement with the spirit of supersymmetry.

25 Conclusion 
 

The  structure  of  fundamental  physics  appears  to  be  based  on  a  system  of  dualities 
seemingly  designed  to  allow  us  to  obtain  ‘something  from  nothing’.  Nature,  as a whole, 
remains  uncharacterized  and  uncharacterizable  when  we  define  it  in  terms  of  the 
symmetrical  fundamental  parameter  group  space,  time,  mass  and  charge.  The  dualities 
within this set generate a full range of group structures, including both finite groups and the 
Lie  groups  defining  their  transformations,  from  the  simplest  finite  group  C2  up  to  the 
exceptional Lie group E8 involved in superstring theories. Incorporated within these group 
structures is a remarkably powerful version of the Dirac algebra, with a suggestive nilpotent 
structure, which, in turn, requires a broken symmetry between the four known interactions, 
and a mechanism for deriving fundamental particle structures and particle masses.

Abstract.  We  first  define  the  functions  which  ensure  the  transformation  of 
momentum and energy of a tardyon, the transformation of the wave vector 
and  the  frequency  of  the  associated  wave.  Having  done  this,  we  show  that 
they  ensure  the  relativistic  invariance  of  the  quotient  between  momentum 
and wave vector and between energy and frequency if the product between 
particle velocity u and phase velocity w is a relativistic invariant (uw=c2), a 
condition  which  is  a  natural  combination  of  special  relativity  theory  and 
quantum mechanics. 
Jorgensen1  starts  his  paper  entitled  “Relativity  and  quantum”  by 
 
stating  that  beams  of  entities,  such  as  electrons,  may  produce  diffraction 
patterns. These patterns may be interpreted in terms of particles and waves. 
One  obvious  question  concerning  this  phenomenon  is  what  is  the 
functional  relation  between  the  momentum  of  the  entity  and  its 
momentum? While this relation is well known, it is of interest to look  for 
another way to arrive at this function by using special relativity theory and 
the  fundamental  observation  that  the  mathematical  form  of  a  law  of  nature 
cannot contain any parameters relating to more than one reference frame. 
The purpose of our paper is to analyze the properties involved in the 
 
transformation of the space-time coordinates of the same event, of the mass 
(energy) and momentum of the same tardyon and of the  frequency and the 
wave  vector  of  a  wave  propagating  at  subluminal  velocities;  this    last 
enables us to introduce the concept of phase velocity. 
 
 
reference frame I along a direction that  makes an angle θ with the positive 
direction  of  the  OX  axis.  After  a  given  time  of  propagation  t  the  electron 
  generating  the

Equation (7) suggests considering that

where  F(V)  represents  an  unknown  function  which  depends  only  on  the 
relative  velocity  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  involved.  We  obtain  this 
function  by  imposing  u=0  in  (9).  Under  such  conditions,  observers  from  I 
measure  the  rest  mass  of  the  electron  as  m0,  whereas  observers  from  I’ 
measure its inertial mass m given by

Experiment2  and  special  relativity  combined  with  conservation  laws  of 
momentum  and  energy3  leads  to  the  following  relationship  between  rest 
mass and inertial mass of the same electron

momentum and the inertial mass of the photon is the invariant c.

results obtained by  this author and extending them to  the case of the wave 
vector, we have the following transformation equations

have the same limit for w=c equal to

Planck’s  constant,  respectively.  Because  universal  constants  are  relativistic 
invariants,  we  expect  that  the  combinations  of  physical  quantities  P/k  and 
E/
  should  have  the  same  magnitude  in  all  inertial  reference  frames  in 
relative  motion.  As  we  can  see,  De  Broglie’s  equations  (20)  and  (21) 
combine a physical quantity which characterizes the particle property (P,E) 
and  a  physical  quantity  that  characterizes  the  wave  property  (k,

into account the results obtained above, we can present (20) and (21) as

Analyzing  the  properties  of  the  functions  involved  in  the  transformation

also for  
 
 
Moller3  derives  condition  (24)  by  imposing  the  condition  that  the  particle 
moves and the wave propagates along the same direction. A combination of 
quantum mechanics and special relativity leads to the same result and goes

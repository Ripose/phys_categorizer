This paper aims at demonstrating that: 1/ Assuming the equality of the two-way transit time 
of light in vacuo, along the two perpendicular arms of Michelson’s interferometers (modern 
versions of Michelson’s experiment), and the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light in 
the  Earth  frame,  two  facts  supported  today  by  strong  experimental  arguments,  length 
contraction (in Lorentz and FitzGerald’s approach) should no longer be regarded as an ad 
hoc hypothesis, it appears necessary and can be easily deduced. 2/ It is greatly the merit of 
Builder and Prokhovnik to have demonstrated that, assuming length contraction, the two-
way transit time of light along a rod is the same in any direction of space. We agree with 
these authors up to this point, but, contrary to what is often believed, their approach failed 
to reconcile aether theory with the invariance of the apparent (measured) two-way speed of 
light.  Yet,  as  we  shall  show,  due  to  the  systematic  measurement  distortions  entailed  by 
length  contraction  and  clock  retardation  assumed  by  aether  theory,  the  two-way  speed  of 
light,  although  anisotropic  and  dependent  on  the  absolute  speed  of  the  frame  where  it  is 
measured, is always found equal to C. The reasons of this paradoxical but important result 
will be developed here. They confirm Lorentz-Fitzgerald’s contraction and lend support of 
the existence of a preferred aether frame. 

 

 

     I.     Introduction.  

Since the early days of relativity theory, Lorentz-FitzGerald’s contraction has been the focus of a 

debate which is still lively today, and divides physicists in opposite camps. 

Some  reegard  length  contraction  (L.C)  as  a  naïve  opinion,  for  example  Wesley  1,  Phipps  2, 
Cornille 3,  Galeczki 4.  Some  others  consider  it  as  a  fundamental  process  which  explains  a  lot  of 
experimental  facts.  Among  them  Bell 5,  Selleri 6,  Builder,  Prokhovnik 7,  Dishington 8,  Mansouri  and 
Sexl 9

, Wilhelm 10a. 

Length contraction has been proposed by Lorentz  11 and FitzGerald  12 in order to explain the null 
result of Michelson’s experiment. (In fact the result was not completely null, but much smaller than 
the  result  expected.  We  know  today  that  a  completely  null  result  can  only  be  observed  in  vacuum 
experiments) 

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  conception  shared  by  Lorentz  and  FitzGerald  and  by  the  above 
mentioned authors about L.C is completely different from the L.C of special relativity. It is the same 
for  all  observers.  It  is  not  observer  dependent.  Nevertheless,  since  the  standard  used  to  measure  the 
length of a moving body is contracted in the same ratio as the body itself, the contraction cannot be 
demonstrated  by  an  observer  attached  to  the  moving  frame.  Therefore,  L.C  was  never  directly 
observed  and  only  an  indirect  measurement  could  be  envisaged.  This  was  the  objective  of  different 
renowned physicists who tried to observe the physical modifications entailed by motion: variation of 
the refractive index of a refringent solid (Rayleigh 13 and Brace 14), influence of the aether wind on a

charged condenser the plates of which make a certain angle with the direction of translation (Trouton 
and  Noble  15),  experiments  of  Trouton  and  Rankine  16  and  of  Chase  17  and  Tomashek 18  on  the 
electrical resistance of moving objects, and finally of Wood Tomlison and Essex 19 on the frequency of 
the longitudinal vibration of a rod. 

Yet the experiments all proved negative. 
In  order  to  justify  the  lack  of  experimental  evidence,  Lorentz  was  compelled  to  postulate  the 
variation  of  mass  with  speed  (see  ref  20,  p  99  and  105).  But,  in  ref  21,  we  demonstrated  that  if  we 
assume  the  existence  of  a  privileged  aether  frame,  the  space-time  transformations  derived  from  the 
Lorentz  postulates,  are  reducible  to  the  Galilean  transformations  after  correction  of  the  systematic 
measurement  distortions  due 
length  contraction,  clock  retardation  and  arbitrary  clock 
synchronization  (i,e  Einstein-Poincaré  procedure  or  slow  clock  transport).  Therefore,  at  first  sight, 
these transformations do not seem compatible with the law of variation of mass with speed. (Indeed in 
order to demonstrate this law, we generally make use of Einstein’s relativity principle which supposes 
the  conservation  of  the  total  relativistic  momentum  in  any  inertial  frame,  and  does  not  assume  the 
Galilean transformations). 

to 

Thus, the other Lorentz assumptions seemed incompatible with one of them 

which is an 
important  experimental  law.  For  this  reason  they  appeared  questionable  to  us  in  some  earlier 
publications (ref 22,23). 

γ0mm =

Yet, since that time, we have become aware that if we assume the existence of a preferred aether 
frame and of the aether drift associated with it, real frames are never perfectly inertial and therefore 
not equivalent for the description of the physical laws (see ref 24). As a result, the objections opposed 
to  Lorentz’s  justification  can  be  overcome24.  In  fact  in  aether  theory,  the  formula 
has  not 

γ0mm =

exactly the same meaning as in relativity:

is not the rest mass in any inertial frame, it is the rest 

Note  that  another  argument  seemed,  at  first  sight,  to  go  against  Lorentz-Fitzgerald’s  contraction: 
the compressibility of matter is limited, and length contraction seems difficult to justify at very high 
speeds. For example at 0.9999C the ratio 

would be reduced to 1.4%. 

0LL

But we can answer that the law has been proposed following an experiment performed at low speed 

(Michelson’s experiment). It would not exactly adopt the same form at very high speeds. 

Today  we  have  come  to  realize  that  strong  arguments  exist  in  support  of  Lorentz-Fitzgerald’s 
contraction (L.C.). One of these arguments is that L.C enables to explain (in all directions of space and 
not only in two perpendicular directions) the isotropy of the apparent (measured) two way speed of 
light. L C sets up the aether assumption on solid bases which enables it to be confronted with special 
relativity. 

II.     Lorentz-FitzGerald’s contraction explains the null result observed in     

vacuum Michelson’s experiments. 

We  know  today  that,  even  if  we  use  two  clocks  to  make  the  measurement,  the  usual 
synchronization  procedures  (Einstein-Poincaré  procedure  or  slow  clock  transport)  only  enable 
measurement of the two way speed of light 7,26. As we shall show, the aether theory maintains that the 
value C is found when the two-way speed of light is measured with contracted meter sticks and clocks 
slowed down by motion.  

According  to  Anderson,  Vetharaniam  and  Stedman 27,  all  the  recent  experiments  purporting  to 
illuminate  the  isotropy  of  the  one  way  speed  of  light  were  based  on  erroneous  ideas  (because  they 
considered that the slow clock transport procedure allows exact synchronization). 

On the contrary, a number of arguments are put forward today in favour of the anisotropy of the 
one-way speed of light, when no distortion alter the measurement. Although its direct estimate comes 
up against major difficulties, several authors applied themselves to evaluate it from the measurement 
of  the  terrestrial  aether  velocity,  based  on  the  fact  that  light  signals  propagate  isotropically  in  the 
aether frame. (Note that the orbital velocity of the Earth is of the order of 30Km/sec. Therefore, as a 
first  approximation  the  absolute  speed  of  the  Earth  can  be  identified  with  the solar System absolute 
velocity which, as we will see, is estimated at about 370 Km/sec) 

 

 

 2

A  first  evaluation  of  the  solar  system  absolute  velocity  was  already  made  in  1968  by  De 
Vaucouleurs  and  Peters,  who  measured  the  anisotropy  of  the  red  shift  relative  to  many  distant 
galaxies. The experiment was made again by Rubin in 1976. 

A  more  reliable  estimate  was  obtained  by  measuring  the  anisotropy  of  the  2.7°  K  microwave 
background  radiation,  uniformly  distributed  throughout  the  Universe.  "An  observer  moving  with 
velocity  v  relative  to  the  microwave  background  can  detect  a  larger  microwave  flux  in  the  forward 
direction  (+v)  and  a  smaller  microwave  flux  in  the  rearward  direction  (-v).  He  can  observe  a  violet 
shift in the forward direction (+v) and a red shift in the rearward direction (-v) (Wilhelm)". 

From  this  data,  the  absolute  velocity  of  the  solar  system  could  be  measured  ((Conklin  (1969), 
Henry (1971), Smoot et al (1977), Gorenstein and Smoot (1981), Partridge (1988)). Let us also quote 
the  method  of  measurement  based  on  the  determination  of  the  muon  flux  anisotropy  (Monstein  and 
Wesley (1996)). An assessment of all these experiments is given by Wilhelm 10a and Wesley 10b. 

Another  verification  of  the  absolute  speed  of  the  Earth  frame  was  made  by  Roland  De  Witte  in 
1991.  To  this  end,  5  Mhz  radio  frequency  signals  were  sent  in  two  opposite  directions  through  two 
buried co-axial cables linking two caesium beam clocks separated by 1.5 km. Changes in propagation 
times were observed and were recorded over 178 days. De Witte interpreted the results as evidence of 
absolute motion. (Unpublished, cited by Cahill). 

28

More recently (april 2003), Cahill and Kitto reinterpreted the Michelson and Morley experiment. 
They asserted that Michelson interferometers operating in gas mode are capable of revealing absolute 
motion
.They analysed the old results from gas-mode Michelson interferometers experiments which 
always showed small but significant effects. The authors asserted that after correcting for the air, the 
Miller experiment gives an absolute speed of the Earth frame of v=335

± 57 Km/sec. 

Marinov  29  also  attested  having  measured  the  absolute  velocity  of  the  solar  system  by  means  of 
different  devices  (coupled  mirrors  experiment,  toothed  wheels  experiment).  The  experiments  are 
described in detail in the book of Wesley 1, , and are quoted by Wilhelm 10a.  

According to Wesley1,10b,30 the Marinov (1974, 1977a, 1980b) coupled mirrors experiment is one of 
the most brilliant and ingenious experiment of all time. It measures the very small quantity v/C where 
v  is  the  absolute  velocity  of  the  observer  by  using  very  clever  stratagems.  The  coupled  mirrors 
experiment enabled the author to assert that the absolute velocity of the solar system is of the order of 
320

±
This result was in agreement with most of the observations and experiments described above which 
lend support to the existence of a fundamental inertial frame, whose absolute speed is zero, but whose 
relative speed with respect to the Earth frame is of the order of 350 km/sec. 

20 Km/sec. 

- Consider now a Michelson interferometer whose longitudinal arm is aligned along the x0-axis of a 
coordinate  system  S0  (0,  x0,  y0,  z0)  attached  to  the  Cosmic  Substratum.  The  device  is  at  rest  in  the 
Earth frame which for our purpose is assumed to move along the x0-axis at speed v during the time of 
the experiment. 

It is easy to verify that, in reply to the statement that the speed of light is C - v in the + x0 direction, 

and C + v in the opposite direction, the arm will be contracted in the ratio:

Now, in the arm perpendicular to the direction of motion, there is no length contraction.  
The  speed  of  light  is  C  exclusively  in  the  aether  frame.  The  signal  starts  from  a  point  P  in  this 
frame  towards  a  point  O at the extremity of the arm and then comes back towards point P’. During 
that time, the interferometer has covered the path vt2 (see figure1).

In  vacuum  experiments  the  displacement  of  the  fringes  when  we  change  the  orientation  of  the 
interferometer is hardly perceptible. Neglecting this fringe shift* which is really too small to explain 
the existence of an aether drift of the order of 300 km/sec, we can write

Therefore, if we take the anisotropy of the one way speed of light into account, length contraction 
must no longer be considered as an ad hoc hypothesis. On the contrary, it must be seen as a necessary 
cause of the Michelson result. 

Now, on account of clock retardation, the apparent (measured) two-way transit time of light will be 

(from (3)): 

     

2 0l  
C

In  aether  theory,  length  contraction  is  a  real  process  valid  for  all  observers.  It  is  not  observer 
dependent.  Since  the  length  of  the  longitudinal  arm  is  determined  with  a  standard  contracted  in  the 
same  ratio  as  the  arm,  it  is  found  equal  to
and  not  to l ,  so  that  the  apparent (measured) two way 
speed  of  light  along  the  x
0-axis  will  be  found  equal  to  C.  (It  is  in  fact  different  from  its  real  value, 
which according to formula (2) is 

(
2 Cv1C −

)2

0l

.  

NB  -  In  the  absence  of  length  contraction,  the  apparent  two-way  speed  of  light  would  not  have 

been found equal to C, in contradiction with the experiment. 

                                                 
* Note that, the modern versions of Michelson’s experiment in vacuo greatly confirm the equality of the two-way transit time 
of light along the two arms of the interferometer. The measurements made by Joos (1930), Jaseja et al (1964), Brillet and 
Hall have verified this result which was almost perfect for Brillet and Hall. For a review of the topic consult H.C Hayden, 
Phys essays 4, 36, (1991).

III.   Lorentz-FitzGerald’s contraction explains the apparent speed of light 

invariance. 

- But this is not all. We will now demonstrate that L.C explains the independence of the apparent 

two way speed of light from any direction of space and from the speed v. 

The  demonstration  is  based  on  Builder  and  Prokhovnik’s 7  studies  whose  importance  is 
indisputable but, as we will see, some of the conclusions of Prokhovnik were questionable and could 
not enable us to demonstrate that this apparent velocity is C in any direction of space. 

Consider the two frames S0 and S discussed in the previous paragraph, and suppose that a rod AB 

making an angle  with the x

θ

0, x-axis, is at rest with respect to frame S (see figure 2).

                                      The rod AB is at rest with respect to frame S 
 
At the two ends of the rod, let us place two mirrors facing one another by their reflecting surface, 
which is perpendicular to the axis of the rod AB=l
. At the initial instant, the two frames S0 and S are 
coincident. At this very instant a light signal starts from the common origin and travels along the rod 
towards point B. After reflection the signal returns to point A. 

We  do  not  suppose  a  priori  that 

is  the  length  of  the  rod  when  it  is  at  rest  in  the 
0). We remark that the path of the light signal along the rod is related to the speed C1 by 

(where

We remark that:         C cos α - v = C1 cos  θ  
The three speeds, C, C1 and v being proportional to the three lengths AB’, AB and AA’ with the 

 

same coefficient of proportionality, we have 

                                  C2 = (C1 cos  θ  + v)² + C1
Therefore:                   C1

 with this expression in (5) we obtain, as expected:

     Note 

We conclude that length contraction along the x0, x-axis is a necessary condition so that the two-

way transit time of light along a rod is independent of the orientation of the rod. 
     - But this is not all. The same conditions combined with clock retardation, enable us to demonstrate 
that the apparent (measured) two way speed of light is C in any direction of space. 

Clock  retardation  is  an  experimental  fact.  Let  us  designate  the  apparent  two  way  transit  time  of 

light along the rod in frame S as 2ε. We will have (from (6)):

Now, the length of the rod, measured with a contracted meter stick, is always found equal to

, so 
that  the  two-way  speed  of  light  is  (erroneously)  found  to  be  C  in  any  direction  of  space  and 
26 this is also the case for the apparent one-way speed 
independently of the speed v. (As we have seen
of  light  measured  with  the  help  of  clocks  synchronized  by  means  of  the  Einstein-Poincaré 
synchronization procedure or by slow clock transport). This result is highly meaningful and is a direct 
consequence of the facts deduced from the Michelson and Morley experiment and the experiments and 
astronomical observations lending support to the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light.

In  our  demonstration,  although  we  are  indebted  to  Prokhovnik,  we  differ  with  his  conclusions  7;

Nevertheless, in his book "The logic of special relativity" 7 chapter " The logic of absolute motion",

measured with clocks attached to the moving frame, (see formula 5.2.4 of ref 22-1, French edition). 

This cannot be true for the reason indicated above. 
(Note that in our notation the moving frame is designated as S, while in Prokhovnik’s notation, S 
designates  the  aether  frame  and  A  the  moving  frame.  We  will  continue  the  demonstration  with  our 
own notation). 

In addition, if Prokhovnik’s approach were true, the apparent two-way speed of light in frame S 
would  not  be  C.  Indeed,  since  the  standard  used  for  the  measurement  is  also  contracted,  observer  S 
would find 

 for the length of the rod.

Therefore, the apparent (measured) two way speed of light in frame S would have been:

     Note 

The hypothesis of the aether dragged by the Earth has been generally rejected because it seemed in 
contradiction with the theory of aberration. But, as demonstrated by Beckmann 31, Mitsopoulos 32 and 
Makarov 33, this is not the case. 

But  the  theory  of  the  dragged  aether  is  contradicted  by  the  experiment  of  Lodge 34,  who 
demonstrated that the speed of light is not modified in the neighbourhood of a rotating wheel and by 
all the experiments lending support to the anisotropy of the one way speed of

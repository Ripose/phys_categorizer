Abstract— A new ampliﬁer-shaper-discriminator (ASD) chip
was designed and manufactured for the Micro Pixel Chamber
((cid:0) -PIC). The design of this ASD IC is based on the ASD IC (TGC-
ASD) for the Thin Gap Chamber in the LHC Atlas Experiment.
The decay time constant of the preampliﬁer is 5-times longer than
that of the TGC-ASD, and some other modiﬁcations have been
made in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the (cid:0) -PIC.
The ASD IC uses SONY Analog Master Slice bipolar technology.
The IC contains 4 channels in a QFP48 package. The decay time
constant of the preampliﬁer is 80 ns and its gain is approximately
0.8 V/pC. The output from the preampliﬁer is received by a shaper
(main-ampliﬁer) with a gain of 7. A baseline restoration circuit is
incorporated in the main-ampliﬁer, and the current used for the
baseline restoration is 5-times smaller than that of the TGC-ASD.
The threshold voltage for the discriminator section is common to
the 4 channels and their digital output level is LVDS-compatible.
The ASD IC also has an analog output of the preampliﬁer. The
equivalent noise charge at the input capacitance of 50 pF is around
2000 electrons. The power dissipation with LVDS outputs (100 (cid:1)
load) is 57 mW/ch. Using this ASD, the analog output voltage
from the signal of the (cid:0) -PIC is about 2-times higher than the
case of using the TGC-ASD. As a consequence, the MIPs tracking
performance of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with the
(cid:0) -PIC was improved. The performance of the ASD IC and an
improved tracking performance of the TPC are reported.

I. INTRODUCTION

T he Micro Pixel Chamber ((cid:2) -PIC)[1][2], which is a micro-

pattern gaseous detector based on double-sided printed
circuit board (PCB) technology, has been developed for X-
ray, gamma-ray and charged particle imagings. In the (cid:2) -PIC,
anode and cathode strips are formed orthogonally on both
sides of a polyimide substrate with a pitch of 400 (cid:2) m, as
shown in Fig. 1. This micro-structure makes it possible to
track particles more precisely than by using conventional wire
chambers. Furthermore, the (cid:2) -PIC has a pixel-type structure
and a thick substrate, therefore a stable operation is realized
at a higher gain than that of the MSGCs[3]. Using the (cid:2) -PIC
with a 10 (cid:3) 10 cm
detection area[4], clear two dimensional X-
ray images were obtained[5][6]. Using the (cid:2) -PIC, the micro

0801, Japan.

Time Projection Chamber ((cid:2) -TPC) was also made for particle
tracking[7], and low-energy proton tracks were clearly detected
in an Ar-C(cid:4) H(cid:5) gas mixture at 1 atm[8][9]. Intermediate gas
multipliers, such as GEM[10] or a capillary plate[11], are
not needed for detecting high dE/dx particles. This simple
structure is a great advantage of the (cid:2) -TPC. Presently the
remaining problem of the (cid:2) -TPC is low efﬁciency for low dE/dx
particles or Minimum Ionizing Particles (MIPs). A narrow
spacing of the electrodes realizes ﬁne particle tracking, but it
produced fewer electrons per electrode than that of ordinary
wire chambers. In micro-pattern detectors, it is not an easy
task to raise the gas gain, because the electric ﬁeld is very
intensive around a narrow space between the electrodes. A
detailed study of the electrode structure[12][13] and a technique
of manufacturing the electrodes accurately, as designed, are
necessary for improving the gas gain. Therefore, to increase
the gain, optimizing the ampliﬁer of the chamber is much
easier than changing the electrode structure. At ﬁrst, we used
the TGC-ASD[14] in which the decay time constant of the
preampliﬁer was 16 ns, for a readout of the (cid:2) -PIC. However,
this decay time constant was too short to collect all pulse
charges from the (cid:2) -PIC. Therefore, one way to improve the
efﬁciency of (cid:2) -PIC for MIPs is to develop an ampliﬁer that has
a sufﬁcient decay time constant of the preampliﬁer to collect all
charges from the (cid:2) -PIC. Based on a simulation, when we use a
preampliﬁer with a 80 ns integtration constant for readout of the
(cid:2) -PIC, the signal from the (cid:2) -PIC is 2-times higher than in the
case of using the preampliﬁer with a 16 ns decay time constant.
Therefore, we have developed an ASD IC that includes the
preampliﬁer with an 80 ns decay time constant ((cid:2) PIC-ASD).

II. CIRCUIT DESIGN

A. Technology

Because of the thin spacing of the electrodes, the detector
capacitance of the (cid:2) -PIC is relatively large. The measured
capacitance of the (cid:2) -PIC is about 1.5 (cid:3) 10 (cid:7)
pF per pixel,
38 pF per 10 cm length strip. For the (cid:2) -PIC with an area
, low-noise ampliﬁer is needed. Therefore,
of over 30 (cid:3) 30 cm
transistors with a large g (cid:9)
are preferred[15]. Hence, we chose
to base the ampliﬁers on bipolar transistors. A chip has been
developed at SONY corporation, using their bipolar ’Analog
Master Slice Process’. This semi-custom process provides pre-
fabricated NPN and PNP transistors, resistors and capacitors, so
that a designer has to design using these elements that are pre-
determined beforehand for the silicon wafer. The base structure
that we used contains 850 NPN transistors, 384 PNP transistors,
1738 resistors and 42 capacitors, totaling approximately 1000
usable elements. The standard transistor has f (cid:10) = 3.2 GHz.
The low-noise transistor has f (cid:10) = 950 MHz and base-spread
. There are also PNP type transistors,
resistance r(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:13) =17.5 (cid:15)
of which the standard one has f (cid:10) = 300 MHz. The capacitors
are of 2 pF and 20 pF value, totaling 408 pF (Metal Insulator
Semiconductor: MIS capacitor). The resistors are of either 8 k(cid:15)
or 2.5 k(cid:15)
are used in combination.

and 129 (cid:15)

in a common-base conﬁguration, which is usually employed in
preampliﬁers for chambers. The collector current of the head
transistor is set high (0.4 mA) so as to achieve a large g (cid:9)
, which
has an advantage to achieve lower noise at a larger detector
capacitance. The decay time constant of the preampliﬁer is set
at to 80 ns. The gain of the preampliﬁer stage is approximately
0.8 V/pC. An emitter follower output of this stage is provided
for monitoring. The second stage consists of the main-ampliﬁer
with a baseline restorer and differential outputs. A gain of the
main-ampliﬁer is about 7. Depending on the output differential
signal level seen by the switch control section, the switch
connects to the “A” side or “B” side of Fig. 2. When the
switch is connected to the “A” side, the capacitance C(cid:17) will
be charged from the current source by an amount of “i”. When
the switch is connected to the “B” side, the capacitor will be
discharged by an amount “i”, resulting in stabilized DC output
levels, or baseline restoration. The current of “i” is restricted
to being 5-times smaller than that of the TGC-ASD, because a
large current reduces the pulse height fed to the comparator.
Following the main-ampliﬁer, there is an offset setting that
transforms the main-ampliﬁer output
the
inputs to the comparator, where the offset voltage is controlled
by a DC voltage (V(cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:19) ) supplied from outside of the chip. A
comparator circuit is shown in Fig. 4. Its outputs conform to
the Low Voltage Differential Signalling Standard (LVDS), to
minimize power and to assure drivability and immunity against
a noise. By design, this circuit can be used for both anode and
cathode strips signals by setting an appropriate threshold level.
Table I gives a summary of this chip’s characteristics.

B. Circuit Diagram

A block diagram of the ASD chip is shown in Fig. 2, with
schematics given in Figs. 3 and 4. The circuit is based on
the TGC-ASD with some modiﬁcations for the (cid:2) -PIC. The
ﬁrst stage is a common-emitter cascode charge ampliﬁer. The
input stage of the preampliﬁer is implemented with the low-
noise NPN transistor with an r(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:16)(cid:13) of 17.5 (cid:15)
. The relatively
large capacitance (higher than 10 pF between the collector and
substrate) of the transistor disfavors the use of the transistor

D. IC Layout

4 channels of ASDs were fabricated on a 3.1 mm (cid:3)

3.1
mm die, as shown in Fig. 7. The threshold voltage is common
to 4 channels. In the layout work of the IC, we paid much
attention to reduce the interference between the analog and
digital signals and crosstalk among the channels. Both the
ground and power patterns and I/O pads for the analog parts are
separated from those for the digital parts. This chip is housed
in a QFP48 package. The pins of the package were assigned
while keeping right-left symmetry. For protection from static
charge, diodes are attached between all of the I/O pad and the
most positive/negative voltage except those for the ground and
DC powers.

The dynamic range and the gain of the preampliﬁer observed
at the buffered direct output depend on the external load, and
are less than the internal one. The rise time of the preampliﬁer
output is 8 ns. The threshold level can be controlled between
-0.1 to 0.1 pC for impulse inputs. The circuit can successfully
accept signals of 1MHz or higher frequency. Fig. 6 shows
the calculated equivalent-noise-charge (ENC) as a function of
the detector capacitance. At 50 pF input capacitance, ENC is
around 2000 electrons r.m.s..

analog output of the preampliﬁer is shown in Fig. 9, for the
case when the open-emitter is pulled up to 3 V by 510 (cid:15)
and loaded to 1 k(cid:15)
. The negative-positive symmetry of the
linearity was improved from that of the TGC-ASD. The ENC
was measured as a function of the input capacitance, as shown
in Fig. 10. We calculated the ENC using design parameters
of the preampliﬁer and measured impulse response of the
evaluation system. The calculation reproduces the measured
data with an r(cid:11)(cid:29)(cid:11)
and an h(cid:30) (cid:31) of 90. The ENC was
reduced from the TGC-ASD, because of a longer decay time
constant of the preampliﬁer. The crosstalk among channels was
less than 0.5% when analog outputs were left open. If the open-
load, the
emitter buffer for the analog output drove a 50 (cid:15)
crosstalk became 3-times larger. Those performances are of
pre-production samples (240 pieces). Since the design of the
ASD is simple, this ASD can be used not only for the (cid:2) -PIC,
but also for general gas-chambers. Good radiation hardness is
also expected[16]. Therefore, for requests to use for various
gas-chambers in different experiments, mass-production (24 k
pieces) of this ASD was started in September, 2003.

B. Improvement of the (cid:2) -TPC performance

We measured signals from the 10 (cid:3) 10 cm

(cid:2) -PIC using this
ASDs. All analog outputs from anode strips were summed.
All measurements were performed under the condition of Ar-
C(cid:4) H(cid:5) (8:2) gas at 1 atm pressure. When the detector was
irradiated with 5.9 keV X-rays from an %&% Fe source, the pulse
height of the analog outputs was 2-times higher than that of the
TGC-ASD, as shown in Fig. 11. The energy spectra of %&% Fe
source taken by the ﬂash ADC (FADC) are shown in Fig. 12.
The energy resolutions (FWHM) with 10 (cid:3) 10 cm
area of the
(cid:2) -PIC were 30.4% ((cid:2) PIC-ASD) and 43.5% (TGC-ASD). Fig.
13 shows an example of three-dimensional tracks of cosmic-
ray muons. The efﬁciency for cosmic-ray muons using (cid:2) PIC-
ASD was about 20% with a gas gain of (cid:21) 3000. This is a
much higher efﬁciency than in the case of using the TGC-ASD.

this detector, we need to detect ﬁne tracks of the keV-MeV
electrons. Using the (cid:2) PIC-ASD, the efﬁciency of the electron
track was also improved. Fig. 14 shows the track of a keV-MeV
Compton-scattered electron taken by the (cid:2) -TPC. The efﬁciency
for low dE/dx particles or MIPs will be almost 100% when the
new (cid:2) -PIC[6] is operated stably. The results of efﬁciency tests
will be reported in detail in another paper.

IV. SUMMARY

We have developed a new Ampliﬁer-Shaper-Discriminator
IC for the Micro Pixel Chamber. The technology involved the
SONY semi-custom Analog Mater Slice bipolar process, and 1

preampliﬁer is 80 ns. Four channel analog outputs and digital
outputs are equipped. The produced pre-production samples
(240 pieces) performed to the speciﬁcations. Using this ASD,
the tracking performance of (cid:2) -TPC for MIPs was improved.
The mass production of the chips was started in September,
2003.

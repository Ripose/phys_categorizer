Test Facility in the FFTB/LCLS

Abstract 
The  parameters  for  a  30  GeV  test  beam  are  outlined  for  use  with  an  undulator  in  the 

FFTB tunnel where the LCLS will eventually be housed. It is proposed to use the SLAC 

linac  and  damping  rings  in  their  present  mode  of  operation  for  PEP  II  injection,  where 

30 GeV beams are also delivered at 10 Hz to the FFTB. High peak currents are obtained 

with  the  addition  of  a  second  bunch  compressor  in  the  linac.  In  order  to  minimize  the 

synchrotron radiation induced emittance growth in the bunch compressor it is necessary 

to  locate  the  new  bunch  compressor  at  the  low-energy  end  of  the  linac,  just  after  the 

damping  rings.  The  bunch  compressor  is  a  duplicate  of  the  LCLS  chicane-style  bunch 

compressor. This test beam would provide an exciting possibility to test LCLS undulator 

sections  and  provide  a  unique  high-brightness  source  of  incoherent  X-rays  and  begin 

developing  the  LCLS  experimental  station.  The  facility  will  also  act  as  a  much  needed 

accelerator  test  bed  for  the  production,  diagnostics  and  tuning  of  very  short  bunches  in 

preparation for the LCLS after the photo injector is commissioned.

1  Introduction 
There  are  two  factors  that  motivate  building  this  test  facility  with  the  existing  30  GeV 

beams  in  the  SLAC  linac.  One  is  a  desire  from  the  user  community  to  develop  high-

brightness sources of X-rays as soon as possible. The LCLS promises to deliver coherent 

X-rays in the 1.5 to 15 Angstrom range with a brightness that is 10 orders of magnitude 

higher than existing undulator insertion devices. An undulator using the 30 GeV beam at 

the  end  of  the  linac  would  provide  only  incoherent  X-rays  in  this  range,  but  their 

brightness would still be several orders of magnitude above existing sources. This makes 

the proposed facility a stepping stone towards developing experiments for the LCLS. Not 

only  would  the  experiments  act  as  prototypes  for  experiments  with  the  much  brighter 
LCLS beams, but they would also be built up within the future LCLS user facility area. 

The  prototyping  and  testing  of  LCLS  accelerator  technology  is  the  second  principal 

motivating factor for the early development of this intermediate-brightness X-ray source. 

In parallel with the present development of the photo injector for the LCLS it is possible 

to  use  the  existing  SLAC  linac  beam  from  the  damping  ring  to  produce,  diagnose  and 

tune  very  short  bunches.  The  preservation  of  the  emittance  during  bunch  manipulation 

and  acceleration  in  the  SLAC  linac  is  a  key  milestone  to  be  demonstrated  for  the 

successful operation of the LCLS. 

The beam from the SLAC damping rings falls short of the final LCLS requirements, but 

the small  vertical  emittance from the  damping  rings,  which  is comparable to  the  LCLS 

transverse  emittance  requirements,  is  an  ideal  diagnostic  for  investigating  accelerator 

issues.    The  present  Ring-To-Linac,  RTL,  compressor  is  not  sufficient  to  produce  the 

kilo-ampere peak currents desirable in an X-ray undulator, so a second bunch compressor 
must be installed in the linac. 
 
Using the SLAC linac for LCLS accelerator development has the following advantages: 

•  The bunch compressor has identical beam line and rf parameters as the LCLS 

design and is installed in the same linac housing as the LCLS. 

•  Bunch compression and emittance growth measurements would be performed 
with the same accelerating structures and hence wakefields as the LCLS 
•  The  complete  operation  of  the  linac  bunch  compressor  system  would  be 
tested, including the controls and instrumentation for reproducible tuning.

•  Phase stability and pulse-to-pulse jitter of the LCLS linac would also be tested 
in  this  facility.  An  advance  start  could  be  made  on  the  precision  phase 

measurement and stabilization R&D needed for the LCLS. 

Finally, the promotion of research into the production and tuning of very short bunches 

fits  in  well  with  our  laboratory’s  broader  program  and  goals.  The  shorter  bunches 

delivered to the end of the linac could be immediately used to advantage in the advanced 

accelerator  research  experiments  into  plasma  wakefield  acceleration  (E150).  The 

production,  diagnostics  and  tuning  of  short  bunches  is  directly  applicable  to  the  Next 

Linear  Collider  development  where  the  same  issues  of  tuning  and  stability  are  also 

worthy of study. 

2  Accelerator Layout 
The basis of this proposal is to use the existing SLAC linac in a configuration as close as 

possible  to  the  present  setup  for  PEP  II  injection,  as  shown  in  figure  1.  The  North 

Damping Ring provides 10 Hz electrons for PEP II injection and positron production on 
separate 1/60th of a second duration store cycles. The PEP II injection bunch is extracted 
from the linac at the 9.5 GeV point in sector 10 where it is deflected into the NIT bypass 

line  by  a  30  Hz  pulsed  magnet.  The  scavenger  bunch  for  positron  production  is 

accelerated up to sector 19 to approximately 30 GeV. In sector 4 a pulsed magnet deflects 

positrons at 3.5 GeV into the SIT bypass line. The damping rings operate at 30 Hz so a 
3rd  FFTB  beam  pulse  is  also  available  for  acceleration  to  the  end  of  the  linac.  Beyond 
sector  19  the  beam  coasts  through  non-energized  sectors  to  sector  30.  Sector  30  is 

powered for energy feedback control of the beam. It is proposed to use this beam pulse 

with  an  undulator  installed  in  the  FFTB  tunnel  to  produce  X-rays  for  synchrotron  light 

users. 
 
The damping ring complex uses a bunch compressor in the ring-to-linac (RTL) beam line 
to  compress  the  6  mm  bunch  from  the  damping  ring  to  approximately  1.3  mm  at  the 
entrance to sector 2 of the linac. A second bunch compression stage is therefore required 
to reach the higher peak currents that are of interest to X-ray production.  
 
In an earlier note [Emma, Krejcik] we described the parameters for a chicane style bunch 
compressor to be installed in sector 24. The basis of this earlier proposal was to build one 

of the LCLS bunch compressors at the location  prescribed  for future operation with the

Figure 1 Schematic of the SLAC linac showing the second stage bunch compression in sector 4 proposed for 
producing short bunches in an undulator located in the FFTB tunnel 

LCLS  RF  photo-injector.  A  4.5  GeV  test  beam  was  to  be  delivered  from  the  damping 

rings to sector 24 (by acceleration to 9.5 GeV and subsequent deceleration to 4.5 GeV) in 

order to test the bunch compressor using the small vertical emittance from the damping 

ring  as  a  probe.  This  scenario  is  not  suitable  for  use  with  the  higher  energy  beams 

proposed  here  for  X-ray  production  at  30  GeV.  In  order  to  minimize  emittance  growth 

due  to  synchrotron  radiation  the  bunch  compression  must  be  done  at  low  energy. 

Alternatively, at high energy a very large radius of curvature bend must be employed. An 

example would be the SLC arcs, but this is a different technology and takes the beam out 

of  the  LCLS  experimental  area.  A  separate  proposal  by  Emma  and  Frisch  (SLAC  Pub 

8308) describes such a scheme. 

In  order  to  make  use  of  the  beam  with  an  undulator  in  the  LCLS  experimental  area 

beyond the FFTB tunnel it will be necessary to compress the beam at the low energy end 

of  the  linac.  Several  locations  can  be  considered  that  are  suitable  for  a  chicane  style 
bunch compressor. One possibility is in sector 2 where the 1.19 GeV damping ring beam 
is  injected  into  the  linac.  The  ASSET  chicane  and  an  instrumentation  section  are  also 
located in sector 2. The new bunch compressor chicane has to be downstream of at least 
one girder of accelerating sections (i.e. one klystron) that would be appropriately phased 
to introduce a suitable correlated energy spread. 
 
Another possibility is in sector 4 at the positron  extraction chicane. At this location the 
beam  is  close  in  energy  to  the  design  energy  of  4.5  GeV  for  the  LCLS  2nd  bunch 
compressor, so that an installation here could be considered a working prototype for the 

LCLS.  The  specific  correlated  energy  spread  required  at  the  entrance  to  the  bunch

compressor  chicane  can  easily  be  achieved  with  the  phase  of  the  klystrons  in  sectors  2 

through  4.  It  might  be  tempting  to  consider  modifying  the  existing  positron  extraction 
line  with  the  addition  of  dc  chicane  bends  to  introduce  the  R56  term  into  the  electron 
transport  line.  However,  there  may  be  some  conflict  of  interest  in  the  choice  of  bend 

plane for the compressor and the positron extraction. 

For  this  exercise  it  will  be  assumed  that  the  new  bunch  compressor  chicane  will  be 

located at  4.5  GeV in  sector  4 beyond the positron extraction bend. The parameters  for 
the  2nd  LCLS  bunch  compressor  system,  designed  by  Paul  Emma,  can  therefore  be 
adopted for this study.  

With  the  addition  of  the  chicane  in  sector  4  some  thought  can  be  given  to  whether  the 

normal  operation  of  the  PEP  II  injection  bunch  and  the  scavenger  bunch  would  be 

interfered  with.  In  the  unlikely  event  that  the  shorter  bunches  are  disruptive  to  PEP  II 

injection  or  positron  production  then  pulsed  phase  shifters  can  be  used  in  sectors  2 

through  4  to  remove  the  correlated  energy  spread  in  only  those  bunches  at  sector  4. 

Without the correlated energy spread the chicane has no compressive effect. 

3  Electron Beam Parameters 
In table 1 the parameters at each of the LCLS bunch compressors are compared with the 

sector 4 parameters.  

In  addition  to  compressing  the  beam  it  is  desirable  to  preserve  as  much  of  the  low 

damping  ring  transverse  emittance  through  to  the  end  of  the  linac.  The  relatively  long 

bunch  length  of  the  4.5  GeV  beam  at  the  entrance  to  sector  4  compared  to  BC2  in  the 

LCLS  means  that  a  larger  correlated  energy  spread  of  2.3%  is  required.  Such  a  large 
energy spread is potentially damaging to emittance growth, but since the beam is further 
accelerated  to  30  GeV  the  relative  energy  spread  becomes  less  and  the  effect  on 
emittance growth diminishes. This can be further verified with particle tracking.  

Further compression of the damping ring beam beyond the second stage in sector 4 has 
little benefit because of the larger longitudinal emittance relative to the parameters of the 
RF photo injector proposed for LCLS.

3.1  Longitudinal tracking 

Longitudinal  tracking  studies  of  the  existing  linac  configuration  with  the  RTL 

compressor are compared with the modified linac in which a chicane compressor is added 

in sector 4. The LITRACK program (MATLAB version written by Paul Emma, based on 

Karl Bane's program) is used to track 50,000 particles from the exit of the damping rings 

to the end of the linac. A gaussian distribution with a 6mm rms bunch length is assumed 

at  the  exit  of  the  damping  rings,  although  we  know  from  experience  that  at  higher 

currents the bunch does not remain gaussian in the damping rings and this effect can be 

included  later.  The  longitudinal  wakefield  loading  on  the  bunch  is  computed  in  the 
program from Karl Bane's point charge wake function for the SLAC linac structure. 
 
In the case of the present linac configuration the RF amplitude of the compressor is set 
for  the  fully  compressed  state  to  give  the  shortest  low-charge  bunch  at  the  end  of  the 
linac. The linac is phased for on-crest acceleration to 30 GeV at sector 20 and then coasts 
to  sector  30,  to  simulate  the  present  mode  of  FFTB  operation.  The  longitudinal 
distribution and energy spread are show in figure 2 for the bunch at sector 30.

Figure 2: Sector 30 bunch length and energy distribution for a 1 nC bunch fully-compressed in the RTL, 
accelerated to 30 GeV in sector 20 and allowed to coast to the end of the linac 

For  operation  with  the  additional  bunch  compressor  in  sector  4  the  bunch  is  slightly 

over-compressed in the RTL (38 MV compressor RF amplitude compared to 34 MV for 

fully-compressed).  The  correlated  energy  spread  of  the  over-compressed  bunch  helps 
compensate  the  wakefield-induced  energy  spread  in  the  linac.  Sectors  2  through  4  are 
phased off crest as indicated in table 2 to induce the correct phase-energy correlation for 
the given R56 of the chicane in sector 4. Sectors 5 through 20  are phased to accelerate 
the beam on crest to 30 GeV. The remaining sectors 21 through 30 are idle so that only 

the  wakefields  effects  the  beam  as  it  coasts  to  the  end  of  the  linac.  The  longitudinal 

distribution and energy spread are show in figure 3 for the bunch at sector 30. 

As  the  charge  in  the  bunch  is  increased  the  wakefields  in  the  linac  cause  an  increasing 

amount  of  correlated  energy  spread  in  the  bunch  by  the  time  it  reaches  the  end  of  the 

linac. This is illustrated in figure 4 where the bunch length, peak current and energy

4  Components 

4.1  Magnet chicane 

The design of the first chicane of the second bunch compressor in the LCLS calls for four 
1.5 m long dipoles to provide the momentum compaction (R56) term. The overall length 
of the chicane system is 13.2 m with a displacement from the accelerator axis of 0.28 m, 

as shown in figure 2. Four of the 10’ SLAC accelerating sections need to be removed to

accommodate the chicane magnets. The LCLS design proposes that the inner two dipole 
be made movable so that the strength of the chicane can be varied to control the R56. 
 

It would be preferable to orient the dipoles to deflect the beam vertically so that in-plane 

emittance  growth  phenomena  could  be  studied  more  carefully  using  the  small  vertical 

emittance from the damping rings. This might be, in general, desirable for the LCLS to 

avoid blocking the tunnel access with horizontal bends. It is further foreseen to make the 
chicane deflection angle adjustable to control the value of R56. 
 

The  cost  of  the  bunch  compressor  section  can  be  significantly  reduced  by  re-using 

components from the SLC. Several magnets in the SLC have suitable parameters for use 

in the LCLS and have been listed in a separate note (P. Krejcik, 7/30/99). 

4.2  Diagnostics 

An instrumentation section would be incorporated into the compressor section. It would 

comprise: 
•  Transverse emittance measuring wire scanners. A minimum of 3 need to be arranged 

with optimal betatron phase advance. 

•  Energy spread measurement using a single wire scanner located in the high dispersion 

region of the chicane. 

•  Orbit control with precision BPMS to correct the dispersion in the bunch compressor. 
These  BPMS  dictate  that  a  small-diameter,  moveable  beam  pipe  be  used  in  the

The instrumentation section is as much necessary for tuning the bunch compressor as it is 

for  accelerator  physics  experiments  to  study  emittance  growth  phenomena  associated 

with producing short bunches. Of equal importance is the exercise of operating the bunch 

compressor in the environment of the LCLS and solving the problems of phase stability 

in the linac RF system. 

As  has  been  detailed  before,  the  majority  of  these  components  are  available  for 

reclamation from the SLC. There is a considerable cost benefit to this approach, as well 

as  the  advantage  of  using  components  that  are  already  integrated  into  the  SLAC 

accelerator control system. 

5  Properties of the Undulator Radiation 
The  radiation  wavelength,  the  average  brightness  and  the  peak  brightness  of  the 

incoherent  radiation  in  the  LCLS  reference  design  can  be  compared  to  the  following 

cases: 

Operation over a wider range of energies up to 50 GeV 
Operation with the larger emittance and bunch length using the damping ring beam 
Operation with a much shorter test section of the LCLS undulator 

5.1  Wavelength 

The wavelength of the incoherent radiation, λr, depends only on the undulator magnetic 
parameter, K, the undulator wavelength, λu, and the beam energy, as given by

Figure 6: Wavelength of the spontaneous radiation as a function of the electron beam energy 

The  wavelength  is  independent  of  the  emittance  or  bunch  length.  Figure  5  shows  the 

quadratic decrease in wavelength attainable as the energy is raised above the 15 GeV 

LCLS design energy. 

5.2  Brightness 

The brightness of the radiation depends both on the undulator and beam properties. The 
noncoherent radiation brightness decreases quadratically with the larger emittance of the 
damping  ring  electron  beam.  There  is  also  a  decrease  in  brightness  from  using  fewer 
undulator periods, for example, if shorter test sections of undulator were to be used. The 
brightness  does  increase  with  the  higher  energies  achievable  with  the  longer  linac.  The 
average brightness is a function of:

In figure 7 the average brightness is shown as a function of energy for an electron beam 

with the LCLS design parameters compared to the parameters for the damping ring-linac 

beam.  The  damping  rings  can  provide  either  round  beams  with  equal  emittances  0f  15 

mm mrad, or flat beams with vertical and horizontal emittances of 2x30 mm mrad. The 

flat beams produce a brighter beam since the brightness shown in figure 4 depends on the 

product of the transverse emittances. The case for a shorter, test undulator is also shown.

The peak brightness as a function of energy is shown in figure 8 for the LCLS case and 

the damping ring-linac beam. 

The  loss  in  brightness  associated  with  the  larger  emittance  of  the  damping  ring  can  be 

partly compensated by employing a higher charge per bunch. Although the damping rings 
have been demonstrated to easily operate with the 5 nC per bunch listed in table 1, there 

will be a trade off in the linac emittance growth. More extensive simulation of the present 

linac would be required to find the optimum charge density above which linac wakefields 

would cause unacceptable emittance growth. 

6  Future Options 
The  30  GeV  energy  operation  at  10  Hz  is  described  here  because  it  coincides  with  the 

current operating regime for the linac in its PEP II injection mode. Higher energies, up to 

50  GeV  are  also  available  in  the  linac  at  the  cost  of  powering  more  of  the  linac 

accelerating sections. The additional acceleration in sectors 20 through 30 has no effect 

on the PEP II injection. The FFTB beam lines are able to transport 50 GeV beams, giving 

the possibility of even shorter wavelength X-ray production in the LCLS. If the demand 

for higher average brightness becomes an issue for the experimentalist then the repetition 

rate  of  the  facility  can  be  raised  from  10  Hz  to  120  Hz,  where  the  only  major  concern 

would be the additional cost for electrical operating power. 
 
The  capability  to  make  shorter  wavelength  incoherent  radiation  may  well  remain  a 
significant  part  of  the  LCLS  experimental  capability,  in  which  case  the  sector-4  bunch 
compressor installation would be a permanent feature of the LCLS construction. 
 
A  further  improvement  in  peak  brightness  could  be  achieved  by  exploiting  the  present 
low repetition rate of the damping rings and operating them at lower energy. With 30 Hz 

operation at 750 MeV versus the present 1.19 GeV we can expect a factor 4 improvement 

in transverse emittances as well as shorter bunch lengths (see, Proceedings of DR2000).

Looking further ahead it is conceivable that a second rf photo-injector would eventually 

be built near the beginning of the linac to provide high-brightness, high-energy beams to 

produce  coherent  radiation  at  the  shorter  wavelengths.  The  sector-4  bunch  compressor 

would be an integral part of this upgrade. 

7  Conclusion 
The addition of a second bunch compressor to  the SLAC  linac  at the  4.5  GeV  location 
gives a capability of delivering bunches as short as 100 µm with peak currents possibly as 
high as several kilo Amperes. The mode of operation where 30 GeV beams are delivered 

LCLS/FFTB  is  fully  compatible  with  the  present  PEP  II    injection  and  entails  no 
additional operating costs for the linac. The FFTB beam line handles beams up to 50 GeV 

so there is also an option for even shorter wavelength X-ray undulator radiation using the 

full complement of linac klystrons. 

Such  a  facility  provides  an  intermediate  source  of  Xray  radiation  with  a  brightness 

between that of present facilities and the proposed LCLS project. This would provide the 

laboratory  with  an  opportunity  to  develop  techniques  in  handling  and  diagnosing  high-

power  X-ray  beams.  Tests  for  future  LCLS  experiments,  such  as  laser  pump  probe 

measurements, could be performed with the high-brightness spontaneous radiation from 

this facility. 

The experience gained in the production and tuning of short bunch electron beams is also 

an invaluable intermediate step towards the LCLS. The compressor components would be 

exact  prototypes  for  the  LCLS  and  would  be  operating  with  the  same  linac  and  in  the 

same  RF  environment.  The  machine  physics  associated  with  operating  the  linac  with 
short bunches is sufficiently new and challenging to be of interest to the NLC and other 
future accelerator studies at SLAC.

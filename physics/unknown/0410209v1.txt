Abstract.  A  case  of  moving  one-dimensional  electromagnetic  (EM)  solitons  formed  in  a 
relativistic  interaction  of  a  linearly  polarized  laser  light  with  underdense  cold  plasma  is 
investigated.  The  relativistic  Lorentz  force  in  an  intense  laser  light  pushes  electrons  into 
longitudinal  motion  generating  coupled  longitudal-transverse  wave  modes.  In  a  weakly 
relativistic  approximation  these  modes  are  well  described  by  a  dynamical  equation  of  the 
generalized  nonlinear  Schrödinger  type,  with  two  additional  nonlocal  terms  [1].  An  original 
analytical  solution  for  a  moving  EM  soliton  case  is  here  calculated  in  an  implicit  form.  The 
soliton  motion  down-shifts  the  soliton  eigen-frequency  while  decreases  its  amplitude.  An 
influence of the soliton velocity on stability properties is analytically predicted.  

INTRODUCTION 

Relativistic electromagnetic (EM) solitons in laser driven plasmas were analytically 
predicted and found by PIC (particle-in-cell) simulations [2]-[8]. It has been estimated 
that,  for  ultra-short  laser  pulses,  up  to  40%  of  the  laser  energy  can  be  trapped  by 
relativistic solitons, creating a significant channel for laser beam energy conversion. 

Relativistic EM solitons are localized structures self-trapped by a locally modified 
plasma refractive index via relativistic electron mass increase and an electron density 
drop  due  to  the  ponderomotive  force  of  an  intense  laser  light  [2]-[4].  A  train  of 
relativistic EM solitons is typically found to form behind the intense laser pulse front.  
In  this  paper,  we  treat  a  case  of  a  linearly  polarized  laser  light.  In  laser-plasma 
interactions,  relativistic  Lorentz  force  sets  electrons  into  motion,  generating  coupled 
longitudinal-transverse  wave  modes.  These  modes  in  the  framework  of  a  weakly 
relativistic  cold plasma approximation in one-dimension, can be well described by a 
single dynamical equation of the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger type [1], with two 
extra  nonlocal  terms.  A  new  analytical  solution  for  the  moving  EM  soliton  case  is 
calculated in the implicit form and the soliton motion effect on its self-frequency and 
amplitude  is  outlined.  Moreover,  the  influence  of  the  soliton  velocity  on  the  EM 
solition stability is discussed. These results are compared with the one for a standing 
(non-moving)  relativistic  EM  soliton  case,  obtained  by  some  of  these  authors  [1]. 
Finally,  numerical  simulations  of  the  model  dynamical  equation  were  performed  in 
order to check the good agreement with our analytical results. 

DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS 

We  consider  a  long  intense  laser  pulse  propagating  through  a  cold  collisionless 
plasma  and  start  with  the  fully  nonlinear  relativistic  one-dimensional  model  for  the 
EM wave equation, the continuity equation and the electron momentum equation, for a 
cold plasma with fixed ions. These equations, in the Coulomb gauge,  read:

Equation  (4)  has  a  form of a generalized nonlinear Schrödinger (GNLS) equation 
with  two  extra  nonlocal  (derivate)  nonlinear  terms.  We  can  readily  derive  two

Actually, the expression (8) for a moving EM soliton, predicts a two-parameter family 
of existing solutions of eq.(4). To illustrate, with the Photon number-P as the constant 
parameter,  in  figure  1,  we  plot  stationary  solutions  as  a  function  of  the  soliton 
amplitude-r 0 (l)  and its velocity- v. For P- photon energy conserved, it appears that 
with an increasing velocity the maximum amplitude decreases while the soliton profile 
broadens; up to a point when the EM  localization criteria  is lost. These results could 
be directly applicable, e.g., for a case of a  slow adiabatic acceleration of isolated EM 
solitons in a non-uniform electron plasma.

SOLITON STABILITY 

In order to check the stability of the moving soliton, we use the renown Vakhitov-
Kolokolov stability criterion [9,1]. According to this criterion, solitons are stable (with 
respect to longitudinal perturbations) if:

When the soliton velocity is equal to zero above result (11) agrees with the standing 

soliton solution, obtained earlier in [1]. According to the condition (10), moving EM 
solitons  turn  out  to  be  stable  in  the  region 
  (fig.  3).  We  conclude  that  small 
amplitude linearly polarized moving solitons within the weakly relativistic model are 
stable.

SIMULATION  RESULTS 

In order to check our analytical results and our prediction concerning the moving 
soliton  dynamics  and  the  influence  of  the  velocity  on  soliton  stability,  we  have 
performed direct numerical simulation of the nonlinear model equation (4). We have 
used  a  numerical  algorithm  based  on  the  split-step  Fourier  method10,  which  was 
originally developed for the NLS equation.  

Numerical  results  prove  that  the  initially  launched  moving  solitons  (8)  with  the 
soliton  parameters  inside  the  stability  region  remain  stable.  The  evolution  of  the 
initially launched soliton with amplitude A0=0.4 and photon number P=1.8 inside the 
stability region, for different soliton velocities is shown in Fig.4. The influence of the 
soliton  velocity  on  its  dynamics  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.  Comparing  the  evolution  of  the 
initially launched standing soliton (v=0) with amplitude A0=1.63 outside the stability 
) (a), and the evolution of the moving soliton with the same  l  but with 
region (
the velocity v=0.7 (b), we can see that soliton velocity acts as a stabilizing factor on its 
dynamics. As an illustration of an unstable behavior, a moving soliton with parameters 
(λ, v) outside the stability region is shown in Fig. 5(c).

CONCLUSIONS 

•  Analytical  solutions  for  moving  linearly  polarized  EM  solitons,  described  by 
the weakly relativistic GNLS model equation, are found for the first time. 
•  For an isolated EM soliton case (P= const.), a soliton velocity increase results 
in a reduction of the maximum amplitude and broadening of the soliton profile.  
•  Weakly  relativistic  moving  EM  solitons  are  stable;  with  the  stability  region 
shifting toward larger amplitudes in comparison to the standing soliton case. 
•  Simulations of the model GNLS equation have confirmed analytical results.

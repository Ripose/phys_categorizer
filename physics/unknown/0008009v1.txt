Abstract

A  beam-energy-spread monitor  is  under development in
order to  control and stabilize  the  energy  spread  of  high-
current  single-bunch  electron  beams  for  producing  a
sufficient number of positrons. The author has proposed a
new monitor  using  multi-stripline  electrodes  in  order  to
reinforce  this  purpose.  This  report  describes  the  basic
design of the monitor based on a numerical analysis.   The
analysis  result  shows  that  the  resolution  of  an  energy-
spread measurement is  expected to  be less  than  0.3%  for
nominal operation conditions.

1  INTRODUCTION

The KEK B-Factory (KEKB) project[1] is progressing in
order  to  test  CP  violation  in  the  decay  of  B  mesons.
KEKB 
is  an  asymmetric  electron-positron  collider
comprising  3.5-GeV positron  and  8-GeV  electron  rings.
The  KEKB  injector  linac[2]  was  upgraded  in  order  to
inject  single-bunch  positron  and  electron  beams  directly
into the  KEKB rings.    The beam charges are designed to
be 0.64  nC/bunch  and  1.3  nC/bunch  with  a  maximum
repetition  rate  of  50  Hz  for  the  positron  and  electron
beams, respectively. High-current primary electron beams
(~10  nC/bunch)  are  required  in  order  to  generate  a
sufficient  number  of  positrons.  Since  the  KEKB  is  a
factory  machine,  a  well-controlled  operation  of 
the
injector linac is  required for minimizing  the  tuning  time
and  maximizing  stable  operation.  Stable  control  of  the
beam positions and energies at  several sectors throughout
the  beam-position  and  energy  feedback  systems[3]  are
essential in daily operation; however, the energy spread of
the primay electron beams is often enlarged due to a long-
term  phase  drift  of  high-power  and  booster  klystrons.
Thus,  beam diagnostic and monitoring  tools  are  required
to cure the beam energy spread; furthermore those are also
expected  to  control  the  longitudinal  wakefields  of  the
high-current  primary  electron  beams  pulse-by-pulse,
especially at  the  180-degree  arc  of  the  injector  linac.  A
beam-energy-spread monitor (BESM) with  multi-stripline
electrodes is  one of  the  very useful monitoring  tools  for
satisfying such requirements. The monitor has been newly
designed  based  on  a  numerical  analysis  involving  a
multipole  analysis  of  the  electromagnetic  field  generated
by charged beams. The BESM  detects the  spread of  beam
sizes at large dispersion secions by detecting any variation
of  the  electromagnetic  field  distribution  induced  in  the
monitor  with  the  multi-stripline  electrodes;thus,  the

following  method can be applied to  not  only  measuring
the  energy  spread,  but  also  to  measuring  the  transverse
spatial structure of the beam.

The  electromagnetic  field  generated  by  relativistic
charged beams inside a conducting duct is  almost  boosted
in the transverse direction to the beam axis due to  Lorentz
contraction. This phenomenon shows that if the  wall  loss
of 
the
electromagnetic coupling  of  the  inner surface of  the  duct
to  the  beams  can  be  well  treated  as  a  two-dimentional
electrostatic  potential  problem.  Thus,  any  derivation  of
the image charges induced on the duct is simply  attributed
to  the  electrostatic  potential  problem  on  the  transverse
plane.  For  a  conducting  round  duct,  the  image  charges
induced  by  a  line  charge  can  be  solved  as  a  boundary
problem in  which the  electrostatic  potential  is  equal  on
the  duct[4]. The formula for the  image charge density (j)

where  the  higher  orders  are  neglected;  the  first  to  third
expanded  terms  correspond  to  the  monopole,  dipole,

related to the quadrupole moment at the  least order. Thus,
a beam-size measurement can be performed  to  detect  the

3  NUMERICAL METHOD

A numerical analysis was carried out  based on  a charge-
simulation  method[5]  in  order  to  calculate  the  voltages
induced on the electrodes dependent on  the  beam position
and sizes.  Here, only  a brief overview of  this  method  is
given  (see  ref.6  in  detail).  The  method  is  based  on  the
boundary element method for analyzing a two-dimentional
electrostatic  potential  problem.  In  this  method  some
boundary elements and imaginary charges are introduced in
order to  analyze  an  electrostatic-field  system  (see  fig.2).
All  of  the  conductor  surfaces  in  the  system  are  divided
into  many  domains,  which  are  called  “boundary
elements”; imaginary charges are also arranged near to  the
boundary  elements 
in  a  one-to-one  manner.  The
electrostatic potential  of  each conductor can be calculated
so  as  to  satisfy  the  boundary  conditions  of  the  system,
that  is,  so  as  that  the  calculated  equipotential  surfaces
correspond to  the  conductor surfaces  by  using  the  linear
superposition  of  the  electrostatic field  contributed  by  all
of the real (beam) and imaginary charges. The goodness of
the  numerical analysis  was investigated by  analyzing the
convergency of  the  electrostatic  potentials  calculated  for
each electrode in various segmentation numbers, while the
transverse charge distribution  obeyed a Gaussian function
with  a total  horizontal (vertical) width of  6s
y),  which
was  also  segmented  by  using  finite  number  of  line
charges with infinite length. The parameter e /d   was tuned
so  as 
to  produce  good  symmetrical  and  constant
electrostatic  potentials  on  the  electrode  surfaces.  The
calculation convergency was deduced to be better than 1%.
The obtained parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The  quadrupole  moment  is  dependent  upon  both  of  the
beam positions  and  the  sizes  from  the  above  formulas;
however,  the  position  dependence  can  be  corrected  by
using the dipole moments. It is  also  approximately given
by using the n-pickup amplitudes (Vi [i=1-n]),

Normalization  by  summing 
needs to  cancel out  the  beam charge variation due to  the
beam jitter  and the  sensitivity  dependence of  the  pickups
due to  the  angular  width  of  the  electrodes.  It  is  noticed
that  the  absolute  beam  sizes  can  not  be  independently

The number of  the  electrodes was decided by  analyzing
the convergency of s
2  using  eq. (7),  while  the  total
angular  width  (2/3· 2p )  of  the  electrodes  was  constant.
Figure  3  shows  that  good  convergency  was  obtained  at
eight  electrodes.  The  angular  width  should  be  carefully
designed from a point  of  view in  terms  of  the  signal-to-
noise  ratio  and  the  coupling  strength  between 
the
electrodes[7] under the  condition that  the  outer radius  (b)
and the  electrode length  (L) are fixed by  replacing of  the
present  beam-position  monitor  installed  in  the  arc.  An
electrode with an angular width of  15  degree satisfies  the
above requirement and, furthermore, it is almost free from
a  direct  strike  on 
the  electrode  surface  of  which
synchrotron radiations are generated at  the  entrance of  the
arc. The total  angular width is  1/3· 2p ,  viewed from  the
beam.  For  this  angular  width,  the  minimum  detectable
beam charge is  estimated to  be ~0.6  nC/bunch,  analyzed
based on  the  data of  the  present  beam-position  detection
system[8]. The inner raidus (a) should be determined so  as
to comprise a 50-W
-transmission line. Table  2  shows  the
design  paramters  of  the  BESM.  Based  on  the  design
parameters, Fig. 4 shows that using the design  parameters
the  variation  of  the  quadrupole  moment  to  the  energy
spread  (s
E/E)  expected  at  the  180-degree  arc,  where  the
horizontal  dispersion  is  h
x=7.2  mm/%  and  the  beam
energy is 1.7 GeV, with  various vertical beam sizes.  The
beam-position dependence was neglected  in  this  analysis
for the sake of simplicity.  Assuming  that  the  noise  level
of the pickup amplitudes is expected to be less than 0.5%,
which  determines  the  minimum  detectable  charge,  the
detection error of the energy spread is expected to be about
0.3%.

5  CONCLUSIONS

A  new beam-energy-spread monitor  with  eight-stripline
electrodes  was  designed  on  the  basis  of  the  multipole
anaysis  for  charged  beams.  Eight  electrodes  with  each
angular width of 15 degree are required to detect the precise
quadrupole  moment  for  a  beam  charge  greater  than  0.6
nC/bunch.  The  rms  resolution  of  the  energy-spread
measurement  is  expected  to  be  0.3%  for  nominal
operation  conditions.  This  is  small  enough  to  stably
transport high-current primary electron beams at  the  180-
degree arc in the injector linac.

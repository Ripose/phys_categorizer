The  principle  of  Le  Chatelier  is  one  of  the  best-known  fundamentals  of  chemical  equilibrium. 
Being  originally  set  up  by  its  author  qualitatively  [1],  it  defines  the  direction  where  to  the 
chemical system will move to accommodate a thermodynamic mismatch, resulted from changes 
of the system conditions: the stressed equilibrium system makes a dodge to another equilibrium 
state,  where  the  stress  is  minimal.  This  is  the  simplest  known  example  of  self-organization  in 
Nature.  Le  Chatelier  principle  is  an  extension  of  the  Gauss’  principle  of  least  constraints  [2,3] 
into chemical processes.  
Since the time when the principle was initially worded, it is common to say that Le Chatelier ‘s 
principle is easier to illustrate than to state [4]. Well-known examples, used to explain how the 
principle  works,  are  related  to  temperature  or  pressure  changes.  H.  Le  Chatelier  [5]  and  R. 
Etienne [6] tried to move the principle towards the use of numbers, by offering simultaneously a 
moderation theorem for mole fractions in the form of an inequality. At about the same time, T. De 
Donder  developed  moderation  theorems  for  thermodynamic  affinity  and  basic  thermodynamic 
parameters of state [7]. According to I. Prigogine and R. Defay [8], the moderation theorem for 
affinity  δA(dξ/dt)p,T>0  was  the  most  general  and  correct  thermodynamic  formulation  of  Le 
Chatelier’s principle. Indeed, it takes into account both key factors – thermodynamic affinity A as 
a general force and the reaction extent ξ, depending on the change. 
Unfortunately,  those  efforts  didn’t  turn  Le  Chatelier  principle  into  a  quantitative  tool;  likewise 
with Gauss’ principle, it is still being employed exclusively for verbal explanations. Formulation 
of  Le  Chatelier’s  principle  in  a  form  of  precise  dependencies  will  be  certainly  of  great  help  in 
chemical equilibrium analysis.  
We will use the term “Le Chatelier’s response” (or its abbreviation – LCR) to define the chemical 
system  action  elicited  by  an  internal  or  external  impact,  the  impact  that  creates  constraints  and 
forces the system to leave the existing equilibrium state for another one. Also, it makes sense to 
distinguish  between  disappearing,  or  “soluble”  (soft)  constraints,  and  persisting,  or  “insoluble” 
(harsh)  constraints,  that  are  put  on  the  chemical  system.  The  soluble  constraints  result  in 
temporary  stresses;  they  disappear  traceless  as  soon  as  reaction  attains  new  equilibrium  state. 
That  may  correspond,  e.g.  to  a  one-time  change  in  temperature,  pressure  or  mole  fractions.  In 
isolated  system,  such  a  kind  of  changes  in  many  cases  may  merely  mean  a  system  switch  to  a 
different  section  of  the  reacting  space,  defined  by  new  chemical  variables  and  relevant 
thermodynamic parameters.  
The insoluble constraints do not disappear with the system adjustment to new equilibrium until 
the shifting force is ceased by an external hand. Insoluble constraints lead to minimal, but non-
zero residual stresses at new equilibrium state. For instance, that kind of constraints occurs when 
the  activity  coefficients  are  changed;  or  in  a  system  with  two  or  more  competing  conjugated 
chemical  reactions.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  problem  of  soluble  constraints  is  applicable  to 
chemical reaction regardless the reacting system where it runs, even if nowhere (like in more than 
a  century  long  tradition  of  classical  chemical  thermodynamics),  while  treatment  of  insoluble 
constraints strictly demands system approach.  
The LCR  mostly falls into a shift-force relationship. Our previous experience  revealed a nearly 
universal shape of this dependence regardless the  origin of thermodynamic force – usually it is 
relatively steep ascending curve with saturation (Fig.1, curve 1 on the left picture and dispersed 
points on the right picture; the right part is from [9]; all cases correspond to insoluble constraints).

To apprehend a soluble constraint, we have chosen the pyrolysis of methane in the temperature 
range  of  273.15  to  1573.15  K  at  p=0.1MPa,  resulting  in  its  decay  and  release  of  hydrogen  and 
soot.  Using  the  HSC  Chemistry,  we  found  equilibrium  compositions  of  the  system.  Taking  a 
certain  temperature  as  conditional  base  and  by  this  means  introducing  the  conditional  base 
equilibrium state, we considered equilibrium at different temperatures as states, shifted from the

base, and then have calculated the values of the shifting forces and appropriate shifts. The results 
are  presented  in  Table  1  with  the  following  notations:  η − thermodynamic  equivalent  of 
transformation of reaction C+H2=CH4 (in this case - the equilibrium amount of CH4); ∆ξ (or just 
∆) − reaction extent (equals to unity at the base equilibrium); δξ (or just δ) − reaction shift from 
thermodynamic  equilibrium  (equals  to  zero  at  the  base).  The  negative  value  of  ∆G/∆ξ is  the 
thermodynamic  affinity,  in  this  case  a  driving  thermodynamic  force  between  two  equilibrium

states. In this example the base temperature was 973.15K. The system at any other temperature 
was  considered  perturbed  with  regard  to  the  base  and  subject  to  LCR  commensurate  with  the 
extent of deviation from the base. Two values in Table 1 were calculated by formulas (see [10]): 
∆ = η/0.193,  where  0.193  is  the  base  η value,  δ = 1−∆. In  our  definition,  ∆ indicates  system 
proximity to thermodynamic equilibrium, in this case to the base, taking its highest value of unity 
at that point. This data is turned into a graph in Fig.1, left, curve 2. To move the starting point of 
the  curve  to  zero,  the  reference  frame  was  shifted  towards  negative  values  of  ∆G  by  16.280 
kJ/mol. All LCR graphs in Fig.1 apparently are similar. 
An attempt to find analytical relations between the shift and the shifting force was done in [10] 
with regards to an open chemical system under insoluble constraints and with only one chemical 
reaction allowed to run. To account for possible complexity in the shift-force formula, we define 
for LCR the term ρj as a function of the reaction shift from thermodynamic equilibrium, δj   
(1)                                                 
and corresponding LCR-force equation as  
(2) 
 ρj = − (1/α) Fj ,   
 
where  the  perturbing  force  Fj  has  the  dimension  of  energy  gradient  at  a  dimensionless  reaction 
extent;   ρj  is  dimensionless;  α has  the  same  dimension  as  the  force.  Following  the  derivation 
procedure from [10], we will receive at constant p and T a new equation for the reduced by RT 
change of Gibbs’ free energy of the system at chemical equilibrium under constraint as  
         ln[Πj (ηj,0)/Πj (ηj,δj)] − τjϕ(δj) = 0, 
 
(3)                                                         
where δj=1−∆j and ∆j is reaction extent, Πj(ηj,δj) is a regular mole fractions product in chemical 
equilibrium. Quite obviously at δj=0 we have the equilibrium constant Keq=Πj(ηj,0), and τjϕ(δj) is 
a non-classical term, defining the constraint. The factor τj is the chaotic temperature, the ratio of 
the product of coefficient α by corresponding Onsager coefficient (see [10] for details) and RT. 
The τj is a parameter, identical to the growth factor in the theory of bio-populations [11]; behavior 
of the open chemical system strongly depends on that value. Chemical equilibrium, described by 
equation  (3)  corresponds  to  a  certain  shifting  force;  it  can  be  found  dividing  any  term  of  this 
equation by the reaction extent ∆j.  
To find ϕ ( δj), we write the response down as a sum of various powers of the reaction shift 
n,  
(4) 
 
where δj<=1, and the series power n may or may not start with zero and may or may not tend to 
infinity. The powers of δj in formula (4) may have different, but so far unknown weights νj; we 
will equate them to unity. With this remark, contents of the n-series define the value of the second 
term as follows:  

        ρj = Σνjδj

n  − sum  starts  with  n=1  and  its  upper  limit  is  restricted  to  relatively  small  n 

if  n = {0, …, → ∞) we have ρj =1/∆j, and ϕ(δj) = 1; 
if  n = {1, …, →∞) we have ρj =δj/∆j, and ϕ( δj) = δj; 
if    the  δj

n);  

When the stressed system shifts to new equilibrium state, in case of soluble constraints the second 
term of equation (3) vanishes due to δj=0, otherwise taking the minimal possible value. The case 
of ϕ(δj) =1 doesn’t satisfy any of the equations, and should be eliminated from consideration. The 
last  of  the  above  listed  cases  leads  to  the  logistic  equation  for  Gibbs’  free  energy  change  in  an 
open system as

                   ln[Πj(ηj,0)/Πj(ηj,δj)] − τjδj(1− δj) =0.

Graphical solutions to equation (5), known as bifurcation diagrams, depict evolution of chemical 
equilibrium, driven sequentially through the areas of true and open equilibrium up to bifurcations 
and chaos when τj increases [10].  
We do not know any reported occurrence of bifurcations (or anything worse) when the perturbed 
chemical system under soluble constraints gains new equilibrium state. So, the best option for the 
soluble constraints is 
                              ln[Πj(ηj,0)/Πj(ηj,δj)] − τjδj =0.  
(6) 
Taking  into  account  that  one  cannot  find  the  τj  value  from  the  experiment  (including  direct 
computer  simulation  experiment),  we  have  compared  appropriate  curves  for  both  shapes  of  the 
second  term,  obtained  by  computer  experiment,  and  data  for  a  soluble  constraint  on  the 
C+H2=CH4  reaction  from  Table  1  (Fig.2).  We  would  like  to  focus  the  reader’s  attention  on  2 
features of the curves in Fig.2. First, solution curves to both equations (5) and (6) very well match 
each other prior to bifurcation point. Second, the curve 3 for a soluble constraint actually follows 
the same pattern, and its fit in two previous curves is just a matter of scaling. A direct proof of

The  delay  area  on  the  abscissa,  corresponding  to  the  area  of  thermodynamic  equilibrium 
converges into point when the curves in Fig.3 are transformed into shift-force coordinates. 
Our observation prompts us to assume that equation (6) may well describe what happens to the 
chemical system under a soluble constraint. It looks as if the more complicated expression for ρj 
gives simpler results and vise versa. Consideration of possible internal degrees of freedom of the 
chemical  system  may  provide  some  kind  of  an  explanation  for  this  result.  Indeed,  bifurcations 
occur at the point where the thermodynamic branch gets unstable; in a common language, this is a 
point  where  the  external  impact  against  the  system,  which  forces  it  to  decrease  the  reaction

To conclude, one should mention that in many applications logistic equations are used to create a 
rough picture of a system behavior with bifurcations and to allow for verbal explanations. In our 
previous  works  (see  [10])  we  set  as  an  objective  to  create  the  system  domain  of  states  using 
logistic  equations  to  analyze  chemical  systems  with  more  possible  precision.  Numerical 
presentation  of  Le  Chatelier’s  principle  was  a  key  idea  to  success  in  the  thermodynamics  of 
chemical systems, unifying the equilibrium and non-equilibrium branches on a unique basis in the 
treatment of chemical equilibrium.

Abstract

The  network approach  plays a  distinguished role  in contemporary  science

of complex systems/phenomena. Such an approach has been introduced into seismology

in  a  recent  work  [S. Abe  and  N.  Suzuki,  Europhys.  Lett.  65,  581  (2004)].  Here,  we

discuss the dynamical property of the earthquake network constructed in California and

report the discovery that the values of the clustering coefficient remain stationary before

main shocks, suddenly jump up at the main shocks, and then slowly decay following a

power  law  to  become  stationary  again.  Thus,  the  network  approach  is  found  to

characterize main shocks in a peculiar manner.

Looking at seismic data from the physics viewpoint, it may be of interest to recognize

that it is essentially a field-theoretical system. It consists of the series of a set of values

of  occurrence  time,  hypocenter,  and  magnitude  of  each  earthquake.  In  other  words,

seismic moment (its logarithm  being magnitude) as a field strength  is defined on each

discrete spacetime point. However, unlike ordinary field dynamics in physics, both the

field  strength  and  spacetime  points  are  inherently  random.  In  spite  of  such  apparent

complicatedness,  known  empirical  laws  are  rather  simple.  There  are  in  fact  two

celebrated classical examples. One is the Gutenberg-Richter law [1] for the relationship

between  frequency  and  seismic  moment.  The  other  is  the  Omori  law  [2]  for  the

temporal  decay  of  frequency  of  aftershocks.  Both  of  them  are  power  laws,  indicating

complexity/criticality of seismicity.

Instantaneous  release  of  huge  energy  by  a  main  shock  can  be  thought  of  as  a

“quenching” process. The disorder of a complex landscape  of the stress  distribution at

faults in the relevant area is then reorganized by it. Accordingly, a swarm of aftershocks

may  follow. This process constitutes nonstationary  parts  of a  seismic time series,  and,

due to the power-law nature of the Omori law, “relaxation” to a stationary state is very

slow. In a recent work [3], it has been found that there are striking similarities between

the aftershock phenomenon and glassy dynamics, including aging and scaling.

In  the  previous  works  [4,5],  we  have  studied  the  spatio-temporal  complexity  of

seismicity  and  found  that  both  the  spatial  distance  and  time  interval  between  two

successive  earthquakes  obey  specific  but  remarkably  simple  statistical  laws.  Those

results  indicate  that  successive  events  are  indivisibly  correlated,  no  matter  how  large

2

their spatial separation is. In fact, there is an investigation [6], which points out that an

earthquake can be triggered by a foregoing one, which is more than 1000 km away. This

implies that the seismic correlation length may be enormously large, exhibiting a strong

similarity to phase transition and critical phenomena. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to

put spatial windows in analysis of seismicity, in general.

To characterize complexity of event-event correlation in seismicity, we have recently

proposed  the  network approach  [7-10],  in which  seismic data  is  mapped  to a  growing

random graph. This graph, termed the earthquake network, is constructed as follows. A

geographical region under consideration is divided into a lot of small cubic cells. A cell

is  regarded  as  a  vertex  of  a  network  if  earthquakes  with  any  values  of  magnitude

occurred  therein.  Two  successive  events  define  an  edge  between  two  vertices.  If  they

occur in the same cell, a loop is attached to that vertex. The edges efficiently represent

event-event  correlation  mentioned  above.  The  network  thus  constructed  represents

dynamical  information  of  seismicity  in  a  peculiar  manner.  (Another  procedure  of

constructing  an  earthquake  network,  which  is  more  complicated  than  the  present  one

introducing  seven  parameters  including  the  spatial  distance,  time  interval,  magnitude,

and  so  on,  is  considered  for  example  in  Ref.  [11].)  Several  comments  on  this

construction  are  in  order.  Firstly,  it  contains  a  single  parameter,  the  cell  size,  which

determines  a  scale  of  coarse  graining.  Once  the  cell  size  is  fixed,  the  earthquake

network  is  unambiguously  defined.  Since  there  are  no  a  priori  operational  rules  to

determine the cell size, it is of importance to examine the dependence of the property of

earthquake  network  on  it.  Secondly,  the  earthquake  network  is  a  directed  graph  in  its

3

nature. Directedness does not bring any difficulties to statistical analysis of connectivity

(degree,  the  number  of  edges  attached  to  the  vertex  under  consideration)  since,  by

construction, in-degree  and  out-degree  [12]  are  identical  for  each vertex with possible

exceptions for  the first and the last ones in the analysis: that is, the in-degree and out-

degree  do  not  have  to  be  distinguished  each  other  in  the  analysis  of  connectivity.

However,  directedness  becomes  essential  when  the  path  length  (i.e.,  the  number  of

edges  between a  pair  of connected  vertices)  and  the  period  (meaning  after how  many

subsequent  earthquakes the  event  returns  to the  initial  vertex)  are  considered.  Finally,

directedness  has  to  be  ignored  and  the  path  length  should  be  defined  as  the  smallest

value  among  the  possible  numbers  of  edges connecting  the  pair  of vertices,  when  the

small-world nature  of the  earthquake  network  is  investigated. There,  loops  have  to be

removed  and  multiple  edges  be  replaced  by  single  edges.  That  is,  a  full  directed

earthquake  network is  reduced  to a corresponding  simple  undirected  graph (see  Fig.  1

for the schematic description).

The  earthquake  network  and  its  reduced  simple  graph  constructed  in  this  way  are

found to be scale-free  [7] and  of the  small world [8], exhibit  hierarchical organization

and assortative mixing [9], and possess the power-law period distributions [10]. A main

reason  why  the  earthquake  network  is  heterogeneous  is  due  to  the  empirical  fact  that

aftershocks associated with a main shock tend to return to the locus of the main shock,

geographically,  and  therefore  the  vertices  of  main  shocks  play  roles  of  hubs  of  the

network.

The network approach has been used to examine self-organized-criticality models in

4

the literature [13] if they can reproduce these notable features.

Here,  we  report  a  successful  application  of  the  dynamical  network  approach  to

seismicity.  We  find  through  careful  analysis  that  the  clustering  coefficient  exhibits  a

salient dynamical  behavior: it is stationary  before a main shock, jumps up at  the main

shock, and then slowly decays as a power law to become stationary again. We ascertain

this  behavior  for  some  main  shocks  occurred  in  1990’s  in  California.  Thus,  the

dynamical network approach characterizes a main shock in a peculiar manner.

There  are  several  known  quantities  that  can  structurally  characterize  a  complex

network.  Among  them,  in  particular,  we  here  consider  the  clustering  coefficient

introduced in Ref. [14]. This quantity is defined for a simple graph, in which there are

no loops and multiple edges contained. A simple graph is conveniently described by the

adjacency matrix [15],  A

a i j

) ( i

N

 with N being the number of vertices

contained in the graph).  a ii

= 0, and  a i j

= 1 0( ) if the ith and jth vertices are connected

(unconnected) by an edge. The clustering coefficient, C, is then given by

and  k i the value of connectivity (i.e., the degree) of the ith vertex. This quantity has the

following  meaning.  Suppose  that  the  ith  vertex  has  k i  neighboring  vertices. At  most,

i(
k ki

− 1

) /

2   edges  can  exist  between  them.  c i   is  the  ratio  of  the  actual  number  of

edges of the ith vertex and its neighbors to this maximum value. Thus, it quantifies the

degree  of  adjacency  between two  vertices  neighboring  the  ith  vertex.  C  is  its  average

over  the  whole  graph.  In  the  earthquake  network,  c i   quantifies  how  strongly  two

aftershocks associated with a main shock (as the ith vertex) are correlated.

Now, we address the question as to how the clustering coefficient changes in time as

the  earthquake  network  dynamically  evolves.  For  this  purpose,  we  have  studied  the

catalog  of  earthquakes  in  California,  which  is  available  at  URL  http://www.

data.scec.org/.  In  particular,  we  have  focused  our  attention  to  three  major  shocks

occurred in 1990’s: (a) the Joshua Tree Earthquake (M6.1) at 04:50:23.20 on April 23,

1992, 33˚57.60'N  latitude,  116˚19.02'W  longitude,  12.33  km  in depth, (b)  the  Landers

Earthquake (M7.3) at 11:57:34.13 on  June 28, 1992, 34˚12.00'N  latitude, 116˚26.22'W

longitude, 0.97 km in depth, and (c) the Hector Mine Earthquake (M7.1) at 09:46:44.13

on October 16, 1999, 34˚35.64'N latitude, 116˚16.26'W longitude, 0.02 km in depth. We

have taken the intervals of the seismic time series containing these events, divided the

intervals into many segments, and constructed the earthquake network of each segment.

Then, we have calculated the value of the clustering coefficient of each network. In this

way, dynamical evolution of clustering has been explored.

In Fig. 2, we present the results on evolution of the clustering coefficient in the case

6

when  the  length  of  the  segments  is  fixed  to  be  240  hours  long.  Here,  the  cell  size

  is  examined.  A  remarkable  behavior  can  be  appreciated:  the

clustering coefficient stays stationary before the main shocks, suddenly jumps up at the

moments of the main shocks, and then gradually decays.

To clarify the property of the slow decay in more detail, we present Fig. 3, in which

shorter-time analysis with 24 hours is performed by examining two different cell sizes,

“cumulative” clustering coefficient,

where  α and  M 0  are positive constants, and their values are given in Table I.

In  conclusion,  we  have  found  that  the  clustering  coefficient  of  the  evolving

earthquake network remains stationary  before a  main shock, suddenly jumps up  at the

main  shock,  and  then  slowly  decays  to  become  stationary  again  following  the  power-

law  relaxation.  In  this  way,  the  clustering  coefficient  is  shown  to  successfully

7

characterize main shocks. We would like to emphasize that the power-law decay after a

main shock described in Eq. (5) might remind one of the Omori law, but actually they

are not directly related to each other. This is because, in the definition of the clustering

coefficient, loops are removed and multiple edges are replaced by single edges, that is, a

number of aftershocks are excluded in the analysis.

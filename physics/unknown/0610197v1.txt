Abstract:-  There  is  some  inconclusive  evidence  that  measurement  devices  sensitive  to  local 
gravitation exhibit anomalous behaviour during solar eclipses. We investigate if these findings 
can  be  incorporated  into  the  standard  general  relativistic  model  of  gravitation.  The  General 
Theory of Relativity (GTR) describes gravitation as the response of an object to local spacetime 
curvature. Gravitational waves travelling at the speed of light are then a necessary mechanism to 
maintain  the  required  consistency  between  local  curvature  and  distant  gravitating  mass. 
Gravitational waves will certainly be  subject to refraction by  bodies such as the moon and we 
explore if such an effect can result in an error in the apparent position of the sources and thereby 
give rise to the characteristic pattern of response associated with the eclipse anomaly. It is found 
there  are  phenomenological  similarities,  but  only  if  gravitational  waves  are  considered  not 
merely to respond to spacetime curvature but are also significantly affected by the presence of 
mass, perhaps in a manner analogous to electromagnetic waves propagating through matter. 

 
 
I Introduction 
 
There is a growing body of evidence supporting the view that changes in gravitational force 
occur on the surface of the Earth during a solar eclipse of a nature that deviates significantly 
from that expected merely through the superposition of the gravitational influences of the Sun 
and the Moon at alignment. The anomalous effect is apparently only detectable using certain 
types of instrument operating under unspecified but presumably fortuitous circumstances and 
may depend on unknown factors, including the elevation and azimuth of the solar eclipse and 
the  angular  positions  of  the  Earth  and  the  Moon  in  their  mildly  eccentric  orbits.  There  is  a 
frustrating problem of repeatability associated with the effect and an evident dependence on 
dynamic  measurement,  giving  rise  to  the  suspicion  of  underlying  narrow  resonance  effects. 
The data currently available is reviewed by Duif 1 who concludes ‘there exists strong data that 
cannot be easily explained away’. There are however reasonable proposals which attempt to 
explain  the  data  by  the  action  of  atmospheric  and  seismic  disturbances  that  accompany  an 
eclipse2  and  it  may  well  be  that  the  problem  can  be  resolved  through  this  approach. 
Nevertheless,  in  this  paper  we  investigate  whether  there  is  any  possible  explanation  for the 
effect in the context of the standard General Relativistic model of gravitation.  
 
Generally speaking, there is a characteristic pattern to the data (Fig. 1) with an initial change 
in  gravitational  acceleration  before  first  contact  and  the  opposite  effect  following  full 
occultation (although attention should also be given to the related  gravimeter measurements 
of  Yang  and  Wang  3  which  are  discrepant  in  a  quite  different  way).  The  peak  magnitude 
corresponds  to  a  change  of  acceleration  in  the  general  range  1-10  x  10-8  ms-2,  though  the 
direction is uncertain. One should note that, if real, the anomaly cannot be the result of a tidal 
residual, as the implied change in the total gravitational force acting on the Earth is then huge 
and would have a colossal effect on the orbital trajectory (with accompanied changes to the 
Earth-Moon system that would be readily apparent from laser ranging). The condition that the 
effect  cannot  be  tidal  in  origin  severely  constrains  the  form  of  any  theory  that  may  be 
presented to resolve the apparent anomaly. 

 

Figure 1 A recurring pattern emerging in the examples of anomalous data cited by Duif 1 and taken from 
that paper. This specific example is the smoothed change in the azimuth angle of a paraconical pendulum 
over  the  duration  of  the  occultation  in  the  Allias  experiment  where  the  effect  was  first  discovered.  First 
contact  was  at  11:20  h,  maximum  at  12:40  h,  and  last contact  at  13:55  h.  Note  the  20-minute  deviation 
from anti-symmetry about the maximum that may support conventional explanations based on atmospheric 
effects, though most models predict a phase lag rather than the phase lead seen here.  
 

 
Certainly  one  proposal  to  explain  the  effect  (while  remaining  completely  compatible  with 
GTR) is to postulate that local spacetime curvature moves out of step with distant gravitating 
mass  because  intervening  matter  interferes  with  the  mechanism  by  which  local  spacetime 
curvature is updated. This mechanism is believed to be the propagation of gravitational waves 
at the speed of light, and although these have not been conclusively detected, we can certainly 
argue for the existence of gravitational waves from the mathematical formulation of GTR and 
by  analogy  with  the  electromagnetic  force:  The  guiding  waves  of  the  electromagnetic  force 
are undoubtedly influenced by both spacetime curvature and matter and it is unsurprising to 
see the apparent position of an object altered by a mirror or lens. We also expect interference 
effects  with optical systems when there is  more than one path from source to observer (and 
the  coherence  length  is  not  exceeded).  Could  gravitational  waves  be  similarly  affected  by 
matter? From the variability of reported gravitational effects during solar eclipses, and strange 
oscillatory  behaviour  uncorrelated  with  the  periodicity  of  any  plausible  large-scale  physical 
influence4,  it  is  almost  mandatory  that  the  anomalous  gravitational  effects  reported,  if 
representative of a real effect, should have their  origin  in an interference phenomenon. It is 
therefore natural to investigate whether the propagation of gravitational disturbances is more 
affected  by  matter  than  is  indicated  by  the  low  coupling  constant  apparent  from  GTR.    An 
interference process certainly explains the most puzzling aspect of the gravitational anomaly 
–  why  the  motion  of  the  Earth  along  its  orbital  path  is  unaffected.  If  the  characteristic 
wavelength of the pattern is much smaller than the size of the Earth (but large enough to be 
discriminated  by  laboratory  experiments),  the  interference  process  will  be  smeared  out  and 
the Earth will simply respond to the averaged effect.  
 
However, one should not give the impression that the physical process by with gravitational 
influences  propagates is completely understood, and indeed  some  confusion even surrounds 
the physical nature of the electromagnetic force. The mathematical descriptions of gravitation 
and  electromagnetism  do  not  offer  any  genuine  clarification,  but  do  identify  significant 
differences between the two forces; differences that make the development of models merely 
from  analogy  quite  unsafe.  It  is  therefore  worth  digressing  to  see  if  we  can  gain  some 
understanding  what  is  meant  by  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  waves.  Immediately 
excluded from the discussion is any type of hypothetical wave that does not emerge naturally 
from  the  formalism  of  GTR,  like  for  example  the  guiding  waves  introduced  by  some  to 

explain a curious pattern in the spacing of planets  empirically described by the Titius-Bode 
law5.  
 
II Electromagnetic and Gravitational Waves 

A body does not act instantaneously on another over distance; instead the influence is subject 
to a propagation delay proportional to the speed of the mediating quanta – this is considered 
to  be  the  speed  of  light  for  all  forces  (because  of  the  common  propagation  medium, 
spacetime).  Whilst  the  delay  could  be  predicted  to  cause  significant  retardation  effects,  in 
most situations retardation can be ignored. The reason for this with the electromagnetic force 
is  that  observers  appear  to  extrapolate  from  the  retarded  position  of  a  source  towards  the 
instantaneous  position  using  the  latest  source  velocity  information  available  and  respond 
accordingly, whilst masses subject to the gravitational force extrapolate both the velocity and 
acceleration  of  the  source6.  Consequently,  charged  particles  must  be  accelerated  and 
gravitational  systems  must  be  subject  to  a  change  in  acceleration  before  the  apparent  and 
instantaneous  positions  differ  and  retardation  discrepancies  arise.  In  all  other  situations, 
systems  can  be  analysed  in  a  simple  way  based  on  instantaneous  rather  than  time-retarded 
coordinate positions.  
 
The  extrapolation  procedure  is  interesting,  but  not  particularly  mysterious.  Extrapolation  is 
really a mathematical effect that arises naturally when the equations describing the force are 
solved  under  the  constraint  of  appropriate  boundary  conditions.  Of  course  the  extrapolation 
does not involve  any calculation from the retarded to instantaneous positions  on the part of 
the observer; the observer merely responds to the local source of influence in whose dynamics 
the  extrapolation  is  embedded.  Problems  only  arise  when  we  try  to  associate  a  physical 
mechanism  with  the  process;  the  mathematical  description  tells  what  happens,  not  how  it 
happens, and it has proved impossible to construct a model that agrees in every respect with 
observation. For example, it is common in the context of the electromagnetic force to adopt 
the metaphor of field lines tied to the source that move with the same velocity as the source. 
When the source is accelerated, the field lines ‘catch up’ with the new velocity by means of a 
signal moving outwards at the speed of light as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Note  that  the  diagram  might  at  a  glance  appear  a  little  misleading  –  it  looks  as  though  the 
amplitude  of  the  transverse  wave  increases  as  the  disturbance  moves  outwards,  but  there  is 
actually  an  inverse  distance  dependence  when  the  drop  in  field  line  density  with  radial 
distance is taken into account. There is a close similarity between this field line picture and 

 

the  mathematical  wave  description  emerging  from  Maxwell’s  equations,  and  all  observed 
wave  behaviour,  including  self-interference  (as  in,  for  example,  the  classic  twin  slit 
experiment), is fully described.  
 
But in spite of the many successes, the model does not completely match observational data. 
The  propagating  wave  cannot  truly  represent  the  movement  of  radiant  energy  in  the  direct 
way  implied  by  classical  electromagnetism  –  the  electromagnetic  effect  is  quantized,  and 
energy is actually liberated as discrete quanta. In this context the amplitude of the wave at any 
point should be interpreted as an indication of the probability of a photon being observed (or 
absorbed) at that position. The question then is whether the wave is real or merely a summary 
description  of  how  a  large  ensemble  of  photons  will  distribute?  This  question  is  still 
unanswered and possibly unanswerable. In fact when one looks at the process in more detail 
the situation becomes much more complicated as there is more to electromagnetism than the 
mere  transfer  of  energy.  An  electromagnetic  disturbance  has  the  secondary  purpose  of 
updating the field at all points, and it does so in an apparently non-quantized way and without 
drawing  energy  from  the  wave.  This  is  evident  from  the  examination  of  a  rudimentary 
example such as a stationary electron subject to the minimum acceleration and surrounded by 
observers  with  an  ability  to  measure  the  local  field  strength.  Only  some  observers  will 
measure  the  limited  number  of  synchrotron  photons  radiated  by  the  gently  accelerated 
charged source, but the field distribution will be updated everywhere and the change will be 
verified by all observers. Energy transfer certainly represents some sort of direct transaction 
between an accelerated charged source and observer, but, in contrast, electromagnetic waves 
stripped of the association with energy transfer are a necessary mechanism to update the field 
(the  electromagnetic  4-potential, A). Consider the situation in Fig. 3 (analogous to the solar 
eclipse  situation  that  is  the  subject  of  the  paper).  No  charge  is  accelerated,  yet  the  force 
changes. This is easy to understand in terms of the propagation of a field disturbance.

magnetic force from the instantaneous or retarded position of the proton as the barrier moves past? 

latter  role  would  appear 

 
It  is  evident  that  the  energy  transfer  action  of  the  electromagnetic  disturbance  appears 
separable  from  the  other  function  of  updating  the  field,  though  one  should  rightly  be 
uncomfortable with incompatible mechanisms for two aspects of what is essentially the same 
process.  The 
to  be  completely  described  by  classical 
electromagnetism and not require quantization. This is really not the case; the electromagnetic 
force is also completely and effectively described by quantum electrodynamics (QED), which 
shows  the  nett  interaction  to  be  the  sum  of  many  contributing  terms.  Quantization  is  then 
recovered  by  identifying  these  terms  with  the  exchange  of  virtual  photons  that  are 
individually unobservable and violate the expected energy-momentum relation 7. The idea of 
a ‘field update’ is then understood to be a faulty concept arising merely because we choose to 
incorrectly  impose  a  field  interpretation  –  in  reality,  the  halo  of  virtual  photons  alters  with 
circumstance.  Thus,  in  the  situation  of  Fig.  3,  the  force  alters  because  the  barrier  interferes 
with the flow of virtual photons. Separating this aspect of the operation of the electromagnetic 

field from energy transfer ultimately fails to allow the quantum character of all interactions to 
be bypassed by the notion of a field update process. Complete quantization clears many of the 
conceptual problems running under the surface of the field description given at the beginning 
of  this  section,  but  the  relationship  between  the  wave/field  and  quantum  descriptions  still 
remains puzzling, as does the nature of virtual quanta. 
 
Following this rather elaborate detour into electromagnetism, it is now possible to turn back 
to gravitation and understand that a similar signalling mechanism should exist to sustain the 
spacetime curvature at points distant from gravitating sources. Although the quantum nature 
of the gravitational force is not yet understood, the field update mechanism is of necessity the 
movement  of  virtual  quanta  (regardless  of  any  fundamental  differences  between  the 
electromagnetic and gravitational effects). These virtual quanta are impossible to characterise 
in the absence of a viable theory of quantum gravity, but they propagate even with no source 
acceleration and it is possible that information may be gained by investigating wave effects. 
 
III Refraction by the Moon 
 
In  this  section,  we  wish  to  consider  the  possibility  that  signals  (particles)  that  of  necessity 
propagate through spacetime to ensure the measured gravitational effect far from the Sun is 
consistent with the extrapolated accelerated position from the viewpoint of  the observer  are 
affected  by  their  passage  through  the  Moon.  Specifically,  we  are  looking  for  a  refraction 
effect. The properties of these signals are completely unknown and the only assumption that 
can sensibly be made is that propagation proceeds at the speed of light appropriate to the local 
metric.  
 
We  will test if an effect analogous  to optical refraction occurs because  of delays within the 
medium.  We  may  define  a  refractive  index  n  as  the  ratio  of  the  speed  of  the  wave 
phenomenon in the refracting medium (the Moon) to the speed in free space. By undertaking 
a  numerical  analysis,  the  index  of  refraction  that  might  cause  changes  in  gravity  of  the 
character  reported  will  be  determined.  The  characteristic  value  will  then  be  related  to 
plausible refractive mechanisms in the context of GTR. A ray diagram showing refraction is 
shown in Fig. 4. The superposition of a direct and refracted signal is postulated to result in an 
alteration in the strength of the gravitational force at the position of the observer.  

Figure 4  The diagram (not to scale) shows the bending of what can be loosely described as gravitational 
waves by the Moon during a solar eclipse. The Moon is moving from right to left relative to the Earth-Sun 
system.  There  are  two  paths,  the  direct  and  refracted  paths  with  the  expectation  of  interference  at  the 
observation point.  

 

 
 
The analysis is  generally complex, but because of the large distance between the Moon and 
the  Sun  and  the  huge  difference  in  radii,  it  is  permissible  to  make  some  simplifying 
approximations. Taking the origin of the coordinate system as the position of the observer, the 
situation is represented in more detail in Fig. 5. 
 
 

 
 

 

Figure 5  The angular size of the refracted image is Dx. The leftmost ‘ray’ originates from the left edge of 
the sun and the other from the right edge. The direction of the arrows is for convenience of representation 
and is contrary to the direction of signal movement. It is assumed that the moon is perfectly spherical and 
of constant refractive index. It is further assumed that the eclipse occurs at the highest point in the sky. 

 
The objective is to determine the angular width of a refracted image of the sun at the origin 
(as seen by an observer on the Earth conducting gravitational experiments) as it varies with 
angle q. The simulation program will be run with q  ranging from -5 to +5 times the angular 
width  of  the  Moon  in  order  to  cover  the  entire  scale  over  which  experimenters  report 
anomalous data, and a function Dx(q, n) will be numerically derived. It is not possible even to 
speculate how this signal might be combined with that following a direct path and no attempt 
will be made to do so. We will merely consider how the horizontal and vertical projections of 
the refracted image  alter with angle. The angular widths  of the Sun and Moon are variable, 
but  precision  is  not  important  to  the  analysis  and  a  mean  value  of  0.009  radians  will  be 
adopted.  
 
Let  rS  be  the  mean  distance  from  the  surface  of  the  Earth  (E)  to  the  Sun  (S),  h  the 
perpendicular distance from the  Moon  to the  vector ES , dMS the distance from the  Moon to 
the Sun, and rS the radius of the Sun. Because rS >> h over the range of q under investigation, 
the angles x1¢ and x2¢ (see Fig. 5) can be treated as constants:

The  range  -0.0045  £ q    £  +0.0045  defines  the  region  between  1st  and  4th  contact  when  the 
direct route to the sun is progressively obscured 
 
For the purpose of analysis, the refracted ‘image’ of the Sun is represented as a vector where 
Iˆ  points in the direction of the centre of the image and 
| I  is the angular width of the image.  
Fig. 6 shows a projection of the vector I onto the horizontal axis of an observer viewing an 
eclipse at the highest point in the sky. Note that first contact occurs at 0.009 radians and last 
contact at –0.009 radians. There is a  clear phenomenological resemblance to the underlying 
pattern  presented  in  Duif’s  review1,  and  a  value  for  n  of  1.005–0.002  seems  most 
representative.  Of  course,  the  eclipse  is  rarely  seen  in  at  the  highest  point  in the  sky  and  it 
might seem that a correction for the true horizontal of the observer is also required. In fact, a 
rotation of less than one degree would completely destroy the pattern appearing in this simple 
modelling. 
 
IV Calculating the Refractive Index 
 
It does no harm at this stage to emphasise the extreme arbitrariness of the analysis. Yes, it is 
possible  to  get  curves  of  the  right  shape  and  the  desired  variability,  but  it  is  impossible  to 
make any genuine prediction that can be tested against the operation of a specific instrument 
for  a  particular  eclipse.  This  is  because  the  effect  of  the  disruption  of  signals  that  convey 
information  about  distant  gravitating  sources  on  the  local  measurable  gravitational  effect  is 
completely unknown. Before even examining this complex issue, it is prudent to consider the 
plausibility of a refractive index as large as seems to be required. Note that the value of the 
refractive  index  is  largely  unaffected  by  the  details  of  any  theory  proposed  and  is

Sun  represented as a vector of magnitude Dx(q, n) – see text. The shape of the curves for a range of values 
of refractive index from 1.003 to 1.008 is shown. The horizontal grid is marked in steps equivalent to half 
the angular width of the Moon.  
 

Of  course,  like  photons,  gravitational  waves  will  be  slowed  and  deflected  by  curved 
spacetime as they follow a geodesic  path. The apparent reduction in  propagation speed in a 
gravitational well with respect to  an inertial observer outside the well defines the refractive 
index. The change in speed can be illustrated by reference to Fig. 7.

a photon follows a geodesic path, the apparent speed of light measured by an external observer will be less

. If we make the assumption that  the potential at the surface of the 

Moon is constant through the interior (though it actually decreases), then the refractive index 
is  the  ratio  of  the  speed  of  light  in  free  space  and  within  the  interior  of  the  Moon.  For  the 
purpose  of  the  calculation  of  the  transverse  speed  equation  should  be  used  (because 
movement is along an equipotential path). Taking the radius and mass of the Moon as 1.74 x 
106 m and 7.36 x 1022 kg respectively, the refractive index is greater than one by an amount 
3.13 x 10-11, a factor of 108 smaller than is required for significant refraction effects.  
 
Of course, we have just described a generalised gravitational lensing effect and it may be that 
the action of the individual particles cannot be ignored and may have a more significant effect 
on  the  update  signal  as  it  progresses  through  the  moon  (close  encountering  perhaps  1016 
particles).  This  is  easy  to  check.  Assume  the  Moon  approximates  to  a  body  comprising 
closely  packed  spheres  of  radius  R  (=10-10  m)  each  containing  one  nucleon  at  the  centre.  A 
photon  or  gravitational  wave  will  be  delayed  in  passing  through  the  sphere  by  an  amount 
equal to the integrated delay along the geodesic path. Let the closest distance be r. The total 
delay is simply the Shapiro delay and is equal to 8

For the nucleon mass and typical packing radius, the mean fractional delay is of the order  
10-44,  which  translates  into  a  refractive  index  deviation  from  unity  of  the  same  order; 
completely negligible. 
 
Thus there is no mechanism to explain how a body such as the Moon could impose the level 
of  refraction required,  assuming  the  gravitational  update  signals  are  light-like  following  the 
curvature of spacetime and are unaffected by matter. The hypothesis that gravitational update 
signal refraction by the Moon is the cause of the eclipse anomalies cannot be sustained. There 
is simply no mechanism in GTR for an effect of the correct strength. 
 
V Discussion 
 
The basis of this paper is that the update mechanism is a vaguely grey area where anomalous 
effects could possibly lurk. However we have been guided to the view that the gravitational 
force  arises  from  the  exchange  of  virtual  quanta,  and  the  update  process  for  gravitation, 
though the details are unknown, is severely constrained by a need to correspond to the energy 
transfer process, gravitational radiation. Gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter, 

travel  at the  speed of light and move  along  geodesics. The update  signals  must do likewise 
because  the  update  and  transfer  processes  are  expected  to  operate  together  when  there  is 
change  in acceleration. In a  sense, radiation and update  are two facets of the  same process, 
dynamic and static. If this is correct, there can be no connection between apparent anomalous 
gravitational  effects  during  eclipses  and  GTR.  One  must  therefore  conclude  that  the 
anomalous  eclipse  effects  that  have  been  reported  are  associated  with  the  terrestrial  and 
atmospheric  disturbances  accompanying  eclipses,  particularly  so  as  the  paths  of  artificial 
satellites (particularly GPS) do not seem to be affected when the Earth frequently occults the 
Sun and Moon.  
 
However,  there  exists  a  troubling  paradox:  If  the  gravitational  update  waves  or  quanta 
propagate like photons (the fundamental assumption) then signals cannot escape a black hole, 
with  obvious  problems.  Moreover,  what  does  happen  to  virtual  quanta  that  are  internally 
constrained in this way – does pressure increase give rise to energy jets and mass ejection? If 
black holes do exist, the tidy description of the gravitational interaction (that was constructed 
by analogy with the electromagnetic force†) must be incorrect: The gravitational quantization 
mechanism  then  has  to  be  different  to  what  has  been  suggested.  If  the  alternative  process 
(whatever this may be) should predict a level of interaction with matter to a level comparable 
with the eclipse effects, one would also anticipate a multitude of anomalous observational and 
measurement effects associated with rotating bodies such as the Earth and the Sun.  
 
Not least because the role of the gravitational update mechanism of GTR has failed to shed 
any  light  on  the  problem,  it  is  important  to  really  identify  the  source  of  the  solar  eclipse 
pendulum  effects.  And  because  of  the  Saros  cycle  –  the  location  pattern  of  solar  eclipses 
repeats every fifty-four years and one month – the opportunity exists in July 2008 to repeat in 
every detail the Allias experiment that first revealed the effect.

† It is correct to give the static force a quantum interpretation? If we think of the static analogue to the twin slit experiment where 
the source is a stationary charge, will an observer measuring the electric force along a plane on the other side of the slits record 
interference effects? In terms of field theory, of course not - there are no waves, the situation is static so there can be no wave 
effects. However, if the force is really mediated by virtual photons, we would expect these to propagate and self-interfere with a 
measurable deviation from the prediction of classical field theory. An experiment could technically prove the existence of virtual 
quanta.

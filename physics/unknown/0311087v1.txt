Variations in the flux of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) at Earth during the last 4.6 

billion years are constructed from information about the Star Formation Rate (SFR) in 

the Milky Way and the evolution of solar activity. The variations of GCR show a 

remarkable resemblance to changes in Earth’s climate during the period considered, 

suggesting that Earths climate is closely linked to the evolution of our Milky Way. 

The link could be significant in the solution of the “faint sun climate paradox”.

Quite surprisingly, new results involving solar induced variations in atmospheric 

ionization by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) suggest that they are important in climate 

change1. It has been shown that low-level clouds seem to be responding to solar cycle 

variations in GCR and so influence the energy budget of the Earth2 3 4. Related, but on 

much longer timescales, new work has shown a remarkable correlation between 

variations in the source of GCR caused by the solar systems passage through the 

spiral arms of our Milky Way, and variations in Earth’s climate during the last 500 

million years5, 6.  This paper takes this idea one step further by reconstructing 

variations in the GCR flux on even longer timescales ranging from 400 million years 

to 4.6 billion years, by considering variations in the galactic source of GCR and the

evolution of solar activity. It is shown, that even on long timescales Earth’s climate 

varies with the reconstructed GCR flux. If the relation is real, it suggests that the 

whole history of the Milky Way influences the evolution of climate. In addition such a 

relation could be a significant contribution in the solution of the paradox of the young 

faint sun, i.e. the contrast of a weak young sun and warm early Earth. 

The paper is organized as follows: First the solar modulation of GCR at 1 AU is 

estimated. Then the variations of the GCR-source are estimated based on the star 

formation rate (SFR) in the Milky Way. Finally, the GCR flux at 1 AU modulated 

both by solar effects and changes in GCR source is constructed for the history of the 

solar system and is compared with the Earth’s climate history.  

 

GCR are energetic particles (GeV, mainly protons) that are accelerated in shock fronts 

of supernova (SN) explosions. Before GCR can reach the Earth they must penetrate 

the Heliosphere, the region of space dominated by the outflow of magnetized solar 

wind from the Sun and extends far beyond all the planets out to a distance of about 

100 - 150 AU. The solar wind is carrying the Sun’s magnetic field and is so capable 

of modulating the charged flux of GCR in the solar system. Solar modulation of 

cosmic rays reaching the Earth (1 AU) is described by a transport differential equation 

first posed by Parker7. Neglecting drifts, and only considering high-energy (GeV) 

cosmic rays, one obtains the widely used force-field approximation8, which 

corresponds to charged particles in a potential

GCR

of our Sun is gained from extensive studies of solar proxies with ages from 100 Myr 

to 10 Gyr10. The Sun young was rotating at a rate at least 10 times faster than today. 

As a consequence, the Sun had a vigorous magnetic activity with coronal X-ray and 

EUV emissions up to thousand times stronger than today.  In addition the sun had a 

denser solar wind10,11. These variations could be included in the force-field

as variations in the solar wind velocity, the diffusion 

constant, and the size of the heliosphere. However, for simplicity the focus will be on 

variations in the heliospheric radius.  Reasons are: 1) The derived force-field 

potentials based on  R will in itself cover a large range that in principle could contain 

uncertainty in all of its parameters. 2) There are no clear observational evidence for 

systematic variations V or in 

0κ  caused by the solar cycle (se e.g. Jokipii in10).

Stars that end their life in SN (type SN II and SN Ib) explosions have large masses 

(initial mass 10 times larger that our sun) and relative short life times (5-100 million 

years) 12. Variations in the SFR also reflect the birth rate of such massive stars, and 

with their short lifetimes, also the rate of SN explosions. As SN’s are the source of 

GCR’s, the GCR- source can be described as proportional to SFR. Other types of SN 

explosions are not relevant since their rate explosion rate is much lower12. Figure 3, 

adapted from Rocha-Pinto et al.13, shows the temporal SFR history of the Milky Way 

in time steps of 0.4 Gyr (solid curve), or as interpreted here, the history of GCR 

intensity variations

 in the interstellar media. It is important to note that the 

nGCR

( )t

variations in GCR due to spiral arm crossings are on a shorter time scale ~0.140 Gyr 

than the 0.4 Gyr time step used here. Therefore the GCR shown in figure 3 represent 

an average Milky Way interstellar GCR flux over the entire orbit of the solar system 

around the Galactic center (one revolution for the solar system last about 0.24 Gyr). 

The data in the figure has been normalized to the average SFR (or GCR flux) over the 

last 15 Gyr. The dashed line is obtained by disregarding outliers beyond 2σ shown as 

a dotted line13. This indicates first of all that the general features of the SFR or GCR 

history are robust. There is however another reason to exclude the outliers. They 

represent, in the case of the most resent bins, very close stars that have not had time to 

disperse in the galactic disk. By excluding these outliers a better global SFR signal for 

the most resent bins is expected.  

Finally, 

0Φ

(tΦ

) and 

nGCR

( )t

 can be combined in 

 to give an estimate of the 

)tTj
(
,

modulation of GCR due to both solar evolution and varying interstellar GCR flux. 

The result for 10 GeV GCR particles is shown in figure 4 (top panel) and is the main 

result in this paper. There are a few general features that should be noted in this 

figure. (1) In the beginning of the solar systems history the solar magnetic activity 

was so high that it very effectively screened out or severely damped the flux of GCR. 

(2) The GCR flux increases towards a local maximum around 2.2 Gyr before present. 

(3) Thereafter follows a local minimum around 1.5 Gyr before present, and finally (4), 

a maximum in GCR during the last 1 Gyr. These features are fairly robust, and do not 

depend on which form of force-field potential that is used, or the exact energy of the 

GCR particles. Comparing figure 3 and the top panel of figure 4 it is seen that the 

variations in the intensity 

 of in the early solar system are not very important 

nGCR

( )t

due to the strong damping of GCR by the active young Sun.  

The lower panel of figure 4 contains two attempts to reconstruct Earths climate during 

the history of the solar system. The solid curve shows the relative variation in sea 

level, and the dashed curve is the relative variations in atmospheric CO2 

concentrations14. The curves are a schematic way of indicating variations in climate. 

They are based on a vast amount of irregularly distributes data15,16. The extremes 

indicate either a Greenhouse climate (Warm) or an Icehouse (Cold), corresponding to 

high sealevel/CO2 level or low sealevel/CO2 level respectively.  The gray areas are 

known periods with glacial periods, i.e. cold periods15,16. It is remarkable that no 

glaciations are found prior to 2.7 Gyr, and no glaciations are found between 2.2 Gyr 

and 1.0 Gyr. Comparing the two panels in figure 4 one sees a remarkable agreement 

in the variations in GCR and Earth’s climate. It has been suggested that low cloud 

cover increases with GCR intensity, leading to a cooling, and vice versa2-4. Shaviv 

also noticed that some features of the SFR variation resembled features of climate6.  

 

 

Although there is a general agreement between the GCR flux and climate, it is not 

suggested that GCR is the only influence of importance. None the less, it might be of 

significance.  According to the standard model of stellar evolution the young Sun was 

fainter by about 30% compared to present the days value. As a consequence 

(assuming present day atmospheric composition) the surface temperature would be 

below waters freezing point prior to 2 Gyr before present17. However, biological and 

geological records dating back as far as 3.8 Gyr indicate a warm climate with liquid 

water and sediments showing a biological activity that is much higher than what 

would be expected if the Earth were frozen.  There are other indications of a much 

warmer early climate that present, for example high ocean temperatures ~40 0C in the 

period 2.6-3.5 Gyr before present18. The contrast of a weak young sun and a warm 

young Earth is usually called “the Faint Sun Paradox”, and has been the subject of 

many studies. Even for the planet Mars there are indications of a warm past with 

liquid oceans ~ 3.8 Gyr before present19. One attempt to resolve this paradox is by 

assuming a stronger greenhouse effect than the present one. However, it is not 

obvious that a strong greenhouse effect is the solution20. Another possibility could be 

a brighter young sun, i.e. a deviation from the standard model of solar evolution. A 

consequence of having higher mass loses in the beginning is that the initial mass of 

the sun was significant higher leading to a brighter young sun21.  There are however 

constraints from helioseismology on how massive the young sun could have been20, 

secondly indirect observations of mass loses of solar like stars seems to indicate mass 

losses for the sun insufficient to explain the faint sun paradox for Mars and only 

marginally for Earth22.    

GCR influence on climate can therefore be an important part in resolving the Faint 

Sun Paradox for both Earth and Mars, for instance through low cloud cover 

modulation mentioned above. The exact size of the influence can’t be estimated at 

present. GCR variation caused spiral arm crossings and associated variations in ocean 

temperatures discussed by Shaviv and Veizer23, indicate variations of the order ~ 5 0C, 

and since GCR modulation by the young sun is even stronger, variations could be of 

the order ~10 0C. However, one should note that solar modulation changes the 

spectral composition of GCR at 1 AU, while SFR (or spiral arm crossings) retains the 

spectrum. 

A basic microphysical mechanism responsible for a link between GCR and climate 

has not been identified. There have been several suggestions involving clouds24, but at 

the moments it is unclear. If one mechanism is active over most of history of the Earth 

it operates even though the atmospheric compositions has been changing. The 

observed correlation between GCR ionization and atmospheric properties, ranging 

from years to billion of years, warrants a thorough investigation.   

In any case it is a fascinating thought that the history of the whole galaxy has 

influences the evolution of climate and life on Earth, and will continue so in the 

future.

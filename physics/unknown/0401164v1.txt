Abstract 

 
 
This report provides a brief review of a recently developed new framework for the fundamental 
physics,  designated  as  Quantum  Field  Mechanics  and  including  causally  complete  and  intrinsically 
unified  theory  of  explicitly  emerging  elementary  particles,  their  inherent  properties,  quantum  and 
relativistic  behaviour,  interactions  and  their  results.  The  essential  progress  with  respect  to  the 
conventional  theory  is  attained  due  to  the  unreduced,  nonperturbative  analysis  of  arbitrary  interaction 
process  revealing  the  qualitatively  new  phenomenon  of  dynamic  multivaluedness  of  interaction  results 
and  their  dynamically  entangled  internal  structure,  which  gives  rise  to  the  universally defined dynamic 
complexity and is absent in the conventional, always perturbative and dynamically single-valued models 
corresponding  to  the  zero  value  of  unreduced  complexity  (including  the  substitutes  used  for 
“complexity”,  “chaoticity”,  “self-organisation”,  etc.).  It  is  shown  how  the  observed  world  structure, 
starting  from  elementary  particles  and  their  interactions,  dynamically  emerges  from  the  unreduced 
interaction  between  two  initially  homogeneous,  physically  real  protofields.  In  that  way  one  avoids 
arbitrary imposition of abstract entities and improvable postulates or “principles”, let alone “mysteries”, 
of the conventional theory, which now obtain their unified, consistent and realistic explanation in terms 
of  the  unreduced  dynamic  complexity.  We  complete  the  theoretical  description  of  the  fundamental 
world structure emergence and properties by an outline of the ensuing experimental implications of the 
quantum field mechanics and the resulting causally substantiated change of the basic research strategy.

1. Introduction 

 
 
Despite  the  recognised  physical  and  mathematical  incompleteness  and  split  of  the  canonical 
fundamental  knowledge  (see  e.  g.  [1-12]),  its  scholar,  “mainstream”  development  continues  in  the 
direction of purely technical variations of existing abstract models of reality that never solve the existing 
problems and confirm thus the famous “end-of-science” thesis [13]. In this way modern “exact” science 
persists in the tradition and impasses of the so-called “new physics” that has appeared a hundred years 
ago  as  an  “operational”,  purely  quantitative  arrangement  of  qualitatively  new  experimental  facts,  but 
since then has failed to increase or even reproduce the internal consistency and realism of the previous, 
“classical”  form  of  science,  in  spite  of  hard  enough  efforts  in  that  direction.  After  a  spectacular 
“revolutionary”  period  at  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  “new”  fundamental  physics  has 
itself been transformed into the next, quite conventional standard which, however, not only accepts, but 
actually  welcomes  a  growing  variety  of  inexplicable,  but  postulated  “mysteries”,  “paradoxes”  and 
accumulating  “insoluble”  problems,  contrary  to  the  previous  kind  of  “well-established”  science  and  in 
suspicious accord with the features of quite different, much more esoteric forms of knowledge, such as 
mystical cabala or “experimentally confirmed” astrology. This painful rupture between visible practical 
effectiveness  and  theoretical  incompleteness  of  modern  fundamental  science  inevitably  gives  rise  to 
variously  oriented  attempts  to  find  the  “definite”  problem  solution  within  a  much  less  contradictory 
system of knowledge (see e. g. refs. [14,15] and this volume). Despite a number of new deceptions and 
unavoidable difficulties of a search for qualitative novelty, such kind of work can be justified also by a 
quickly  growing  number  of  practical  difficulties  in  the  conventional  science  applications  to  more 
complicated  systems  or  deeper  levels  of  reality,  which  show  that  the  famous  “unreasonable 
effectiveness” of the standard paradigm [16] is quickly transformed into unjustified extension of the first 
successes in new physics application to the simplest, elementary systems and interaction processes [17-
21].  One  could  cite  well-known  cases  of  high-temperature  superconductivity  and  other  many-body 
quantum problems with irreducibly strong interactions and “complex” behaviour, among so many other 
particular problems growing in diversity and definitely escaping the “unreasonable effectiveness” magic 
of the standard, “mathematically guessed” theory. This combination of actually observed features shows 
that if the very essence of the scientific method is to be preserved, including the unreduced consistency 
and genuine “exactitude” (objectivity) of results, then it can be attained only within a qualitatively new 
concept,  or  “paradigm”,  which  may  contain  only  the  proven  minimum  of  accepted  “natural” 
assumptions and rigorously derive (rather than guess and impose) its main results, always remaining in 
close, inseparable entanglement with reality and  the system of all its observed, interrelated properties. 
 
In  this  paper  we  propose  a  brief  review  of  such  a  qualitatively  new  concept,  possessing  the 
above  consistency  properties,  and  its  application  to  the  simplest  physical  systems,  starting  from 
elementary particles and products of their interaction. The general concept, embracing also the causally 
complete,  i.  e.  physically  and  mathematically  consistent,  understanding  of  structure  and  behaviour  of 

3 

higher-level systems, is based upon the new, reality-based and universally applicable physical quantity of 
dynamic  complexity,  rigorously  derived  by  the  unreduced,  universally  nonperturbative  analysis  of  an 
arbitrary interaction process [21,22], while its particular manifestations at the lowest complexity levels, 
known  as  “quantum”  behaviour,  are  designated  as  quantum  field  mechanics,  including  the  direct, 
causally  complete  derivation  of  the  elementary  entities  (space,  time,  particles  and  fields)  and  their 
observed  properties,  such  as  space  discreteness,  time  irreversibility  and  “flow”,  particle  mass,  charge, 
spin,  fundamental  interaction  forces,  quantum  measurement,  quantum  chaos,  classicality  emerging 
dynamically in a closed elementary system, and all the specific features of “quantum weirdness” (duality, 
indeterminacy, uncertainty, entanglement, complementarity), now demystified and naturally unified with 
the  dynamically  emerging  “relativistic”  effects  [17-27].  In  that  way  we  show  that  all  the  conventional 
“quantum  mysteries”  and  “relativistic  effects”  (actually  postulated  in  the  standard  theory)  naturally 
emerge  as  unavoidable,  totally  consistent  and  realistic,  but  nontrivial,  properties  of  dynamically 
multivalued, or complex, behaviour obtained, in its turn, just by the truly exact, unreduced analysis of 
the  underlying  interaction  processes  and  therefore  appearing  also  in  any  system  behaviour,  within  the 
causally  derived  and  intrinsically  unified  diversity  of  respective  forms.  Note  that  the  main  results  of 
quantum  field  mechanics  can  be  considered  as  the  direct  complex-dynamical  extension  of  the  original 
“double solution” concept of Louis de Broglie [28-32] almost totally excluded from the scholar science 
framework,  but  now  appearing  to  be  the  most  exact,  “almost  complete”  version  of  unreduced 
complexity at the lowest levels of world dynamics.1 
 
The attained causal completeness of the unreduced theory culminates in the explicit, dynamically 
derived  unification  of  the  causally  extended  versions  of  all  the known (correct) laws and principles of 
fundamental  science  within  a  single  unified  law  of  conservation,  or  symmetry,  of  complexity  [21,22] 
which  remains  always  exact  (i.  e.  is  never  “broken”)  and  intrinsically  creative  (describes  explicit 
emergence of new entities), properly reflects the unified harmony of natural phenomena, and definitely 
eliminates  the  intrinsic  separation,  incompleteness  and  skewness  of  the  conventional  science  laws. 
Moreover,  we  rigorously  show  that  the  whole  picture  of  the  conventional  science,  including  both  the 
postulated  fundamental  “mysteries”  and  recently  advanced  unitary  versions  of  the  “science  of 
complexity”,  corresponds  actually  to  a  heavily  limited,  effectively  one-dimensional  (or  even  zero-
dimensional)  projection  of the unreduced, dynamically multivalued (complex) world dynamics, which 
logically  closes  the  theory  by  explaining  consistently  both  the  relative  success  of  canonical  science 
applications to the simplest systems (i. e. the “unreasonable effectiveness”) and its persisting failure to 
complete  the  picture  and  understand  more  complicated  system  behaviour.  We  obtain  thus  the  direct, 
dynamically  multivalued  extension  of  the  conventional,  dynamically  single-valued,  or  unitary,  theory, 
which  is  an  expected  natural  way  of  the  theory  development,  correlating  with  the  attained  causally 
complete  solution  of  the  accumulated  fundamental  and  practical  problems,  now  shown  to  be  indeed 
fundamentally  insoluble  within  the  artificially  limited  framework  of  the  conventional,  unitary  science 
doctrine. 
 
The basic framework and conclusions of the extended theory are considered in section 2, while 
various  experimental  manifestations  of  the  obtained  results  are  summarised  in  section  3,  with  the 
ensuing  suggestion  of  the  necessary,  practically  important  changes  in  the  direction  of  future  research 
and particular applications. 

                                                
1The  mentioned  unreduced  version  of  the  double  solution  should  be  clearly  distinguished  from  its  reduced,  schematic 
version  first  proposed  by  Louis  de  Broglie  himself  under  the  name  of  “pilot-wave  interpretation”,  then  reintroduced  by 
Bohm  [33],  further  developed  by  his  followers  [4,34,35],  and  now  often  presented  as  the  unique  version  of  “causal  de 
Broglie-Bohm approach” (see refs. [18,23,24] for more details).

2. Unified dynamic emergence of elementary particles, 
their intrinsic properties, quantum and relativistic behaviour 
in the unreduced interaction process 

 
 
Any  real  system  structure  and  existence  is  determined  by  interaction  between  its  components. 
The  simplest,  least  structured  initial  configuration  of  a  system  is  represented  by  two  effectively 
homogeneous  and  infinite  fields  attracted  to  each  other.  Guided  by  the  strict  version  of  Occam's 
principle  of  parsimony,  we  should  therefore  accept  such  interaction  configuration  as  the  basis  of  our 
world construction, provided that we can demonstrate the explicit emergence of all its main structures 
and  verified  laws  (patterns  of  behaviour) from that interaction process. Any “postulated” addition can 
be  accepted  only  as  a  proven,  necessary  minimum  for  the  observed  properties  emergence,  and  in  this 
sense  one  avoids  the  ambiguity  of  arbitrary,  subjectively  “convenient”  postulates  of  the  conventional, 
“positivistic”  science  that  only  fix  the  facts,  but  explain  nothing  at  all.  The  well-specified  realism  and 
consistency of the assumed system configuration is supported by the well-established universality of two 
and  only  two  distributed  interactions,  the  electromagnetic  (e/m)  and  gravitational  ones,  which  means 
that  one  of  the  protofields  in  the  above  world  construction  will  eventually  be  responsible for e/m and 
another one for gravitational interactions (see the end of this section). It means also that our interacting 
protofields are physically real fields, even though one can directly observe within this world only their 
various perturbations emerging from interaction and forming the world structure. Being physically real 
entities, the protofields have their own internal structure (though inaccessible to direct observation) and 
the related mechanical properties, including finite compressibility. 
 
In the course of interaction the e/m protofield degrees of freedom, q, are mixed, or “entangled”, 
with  those  of  the  gravitational  protofield,  x ,  into  a  generally  “nonseparable”  combination, 
, 
called  the  system  state-function  and  describing  the  emerging  world  structures  (in reality it measures a 
magnitude of the emerging e/m protofield perturbations, whereas the more inert, “viscous” gravitational 
medium  is  always  “hidden”  behind  them  and  shows  itself  only  through  indirect  effects,  such  as 
interaction  between  the emerging entities, as it is described below). The state-function 
 obeys 
the  dynamic  equation  for  the  protofield  interaction  that  will  be  called  here  the  existence  equation. 
According to our rule of maximal self-consistency (or minimal assumptions), one has no right to use any 
particular “model” or postulated dynamical “principle” for that equation, and therefore it is accepted in 
the form that fixes only the fact of protofield interaction as such:

  is  an  arbitrary  (though  eventually  attractive  and  binding)  interaction  potential  between  the

generalised Hamiltonian). Being understood in the largest possible sense, the expression of eq. (1) can 
correspond, up to minor details, to practically any particular “model” and actually reflects only the fact 
of protofield interaction as such. Its “Hamiltonian” form is also confirmed self-consistently by the results 
of interaction analysis [21,22]. 
Let  us  note  from  the  beginning  the  intrinsically  “cosmological”  character  of  the  theory 
 
formulation,  where  the  demand  of  explicit  dynamical  emergence  of  any  entity  together  with  its 
properties  (expressed  by  “laws”)  ensures  that  our  derivation  follows  the  main  lines  of  real  world 
structure  emergence  and  evolution.  In  particular,  there  is  no  inserted  “space”,  “time”,  or  any  other

actually observable entities and properties in eq. (1): they will be obtained from its unreduced solution. 
On  the  other  hand,  one  does  need  to  have  the  primordial  interaction  behind  the  emerging  world 
structure, in its minimal, but correspondingly irreducible version, as opposed to the contradictory idea 
of  “emergence  from  nothing”  of  the  finally  postulated  structures,  underlying  the  growing  modern 
“difficulties”  of  the  conventional  cosmology  and  related  to  the  general  unitary  science  delusion  of 
“development without change” (see ref. [22] and discussions below).

form of the same existence equation, eq. (1), that does not involve any additional assumption or result 
of interaction development. Such expression of the system configuration in terms of dynamical “eigen-
modes”  (or  “elements”)  of  a  “free”  component  should  always  be  possible,  including  the  case  of  the 
formally “nonlinear” protofields, since we suppose that the internal dynamics of the latter is known, or 
“integrable”,  at  least  within  the  range  of  participating  scales  (and  does  not  involve  itself  any  actually 
observable structure emergence). 
)
 from eqs. (4b) with the help of the standard Green function technique 
 
[36,37] and inserting the result into eq. (4a), we reformulate the problem in terms of effective existence 
equation formally involving only gravitational degrees of freedom (x ):

The  obtained  problem  expression  and  formal  “solution”,  eqs.  (7)-(11),  are  known  under  the 
name  of  optical,  or  effective,  potential  method  [36]  that  is  practically  applied,  however,  in  a 
perturbatively  reduced  version,  where  the  “nonintegrable”  self-consistent  links  in  the  EP  and  solution 
expressions  to  the  unknown  eigenvalues  and  eigenfunctions  are  eliminated  by  one  or  another 
approximation transforming the “effective” problem solution into a “closed”, integrable form. We show 
that  such  reduction  actually  “kills”  the  qualitatively  specific  properties  of  the  unreduced  solution  that 
give  rise  to  the  universal  source  of  dynamic  randomness,  entanglement  between  the  interaction 
components  and  related  dynamical  squeeze  (or  “reduction”)  and  extension  cycles,  leading  to  the 
universally  defined  dynamic  complexity  of  the  unreduced  interaction  process  and  the  unified,  causally 
complete understanding of elementary particles and all their “quantum” and “relativistic” properties. 
 
The  most  important  property  of  the  unreduced  solution  revealed  by  its  “effective”  expression, 
eqs.  (7)-(11),  is  called  dynamic  multivaluedness,  or  redundance,  and provides the universal origin of 
dynamic  randomness  appearing  as  irreducible  “quantum  indeterminacy”  at  the  level  of  elementary 
particle  dynamics. It emerges precisely due to the unreduced EP dependence on the eigenvalues to be 
found,  h ,  expressing  the  essential,  dynamically  emerging  problem  nonlinearity  which  is  not  explicitly

where  the  factor  of 
gN -fold redundance of the ordinary complete sets of 
of 

+   is  due  to  the  EP  dependence  on h , eq. (8b), and one obtains the 
gN N  eigen-solutions plus a separate, reduced set 
gN   eigen-solutions  that  forms  a  specific  “intermediate”  state  of  the  system  specified  below.  The 
detailed  study,  including  “geometric”  analysis  of  eqs.  (7)-(8),  confirms  universality  of  the  dynamic 
multivaluedness phenomenon and physical reality of all the redundant partial solutions which are called 
system  realisations  because  each  of  them  is  “locally”  complete  and  describes  exhaustively  a  possible 
system configuration [21-27,37]. 
 
All system realisations are equally real and have “equal rights” to appear as a result of interaction 
development. But since each realisation is complete as such, the system can take them only one by one, 
i.  e.  realisations  are  mutually  incompatible  and  cannot  be  “superimposed”,  “coexist”,  or  appear 
simultaneously.2  Therefore  the  system  is  “forced”  (by  the  driving  interaction  alone)  to  take  and 
permanently change its realisations in a dynamically random order, where randomness itself, and thus 
also chaos, obtains its universal, intrinsic origin and definition as the above dynamic multivaluedness of 
(any)  unreduced  interaction  process.  We can present this result in the form of the genuine (i. e. really 
complete and therefore probabilistic) general solution of a problem expressing the observed property, 
,  as  a  causally  probabilistic  sum  of  the  corresponding  densities, 
generalised  density

rigorously  and  universally  derived  now  as

its complete form, further levels of chaotically changing realisations obtained by application of the same 
EP  method  to  the  system  of  auxiliary  equations,  eqs.  (9),  and  constituting  hierarchically  organised 
branches  of  the  extended,  dynamically  probabilistic  fractal  [21,22]  that  represents  the  unreduced, 
complex-dynamical result of interaction development and the emerging system structure.

Since in many cases the elementary realisations are not individually resolved in actual measurements and, 
being inhomogeneously distributed, appear in dense groups, or dynamic “tendencies”, containing various 
numbers of them, the probabilities of appearance of such compound realisations are causally/dynamically 

                                                
2This  is an essential difference of our results from the conventional, dynamically single-valued imitations of complexity, 
where  different  “attractors”,  or  “unstable  orbits”,  or  other  empirically  (or  numerically)  guessed  “states”  coexist  in  an 
abstract “space” made up by continuously developing trajectories of the system with a fixed, postulated configuration.

However, the dynamically probabilistic sum of eq. (13) and the associated causally deduced probability 
values,  eqs.  (14),  preserve  their  meaning  also  for  single,  isolated  events  emerging  in  the  real  time  of 
observation (and thus together with the causally specified time itself, see below). 
The second fundamental property of the unreduced interaction result, the autonomous dynamic 
 
entanglement of the interacting system components (two protofields in our case) within each realisation 
is specified in the obtained solution, eq. (10), by the weighted sum of dynamically determined products 
of  functions  of  the  interacting  degrees  of  freedom,  q  and  x   (this  structure  is  reproduced  at  further 
developing  levels  of  the  dynamically  probabilistic  fractal  [21,22]).  The  general  interaction  result,  eq. 
(13),  emerges  thus  as  the  dynamically  multivalued  entanglement  between  the  system  components, 
where the entanglement as such determines the physical, tangible quality, or “texture”, of the really new, 
emerging  entities  represented  by  system  realisations,  and  similar  to  the  above  property  of 
multivaluedness-chaoticity, this process of new quality formation by the (fractal) dynamic entanglement 
is fundamentally absent in the unitary projection of the conventional theory. 
The  process  of  realisation  formation  and  change  can  be  better  understood  if  we  specify  the 
 
expressions  for  the  state-function  (density)  and  EP  for an arbitrary, r-th realisation, by substituting its 
particular eigenvalues and eigenfunctions found from the effective existence equation, eq. (7), for their 
general symbols in the above general expressions, eqs. (10)-(11) and (8):

It is not difficult to see [21-27] that because of the resonant nonlinear involvement of eigenvalues in the 
denominators of unreduced state-function and EP expressions, eqs. (16), (17), each state function and 
  that  can  be 
EP  realisation  becomes  concentrated  around  certain  its  “preferred”  eigenvalue 
interpreted  thus  as  the  centre  of  an  emerging  elementary  particle  and  space  structure  (physical  space 
,  for 
“point”),  or  its  dynamically  emerging  “coordinate”,  while  the  difference  of  such  values, 
consecutively taken, “neighbouring” realisations forms the elementary space distance (or length).3 It is 
important  that  due  to  the  self-consistent  dynamical  relation  between  the  state-function  and  EP 
structures, eqs. (16), (17), they concentrate around the same emerging space point, mutually amplifying 
each other, i. e. the system taking each realisation autonomously “digs up the potential well for itself” 
and simultaneously falls into it, without any inhomogeneity being artificially introduced into the uniform 
initial  configuration.  This  essential  dynamic  instability  of  the  unreduced  protofield  interaction  with 
respect  to  “spontaneous”  dynamical  squeeze,  or  collapse,  or  reduction  around  randomly  chosen 
realisation  centre  is  closely  related  to  the  above  dynamic  multivaluedness  and  (fractal)  entanglement, 
where  the  former  gives  causal  (purely  dynamic)  randomness  and  the  latter    drives  the  collapse  and 
provides it with the self-amplifying, hyper-nonlinear, “catastrophic” character. 
Due to the finite compressibility of the collapsing protofields, the local reduction process around 
 
the current realisation centre will stop at the moment of maximum possible squeeze. But the protofield 
interaction  persists  independently  around  the  point  of  maximum squeeze (also due to the dynamically 
fractal interaction structure), and therefore at this moment, when the dynamical self-amplification force 
of  the  collapse  has  vanished,  the  same  intrinsic  instability  that  gave  rise  to  reduction by self-amplified 
entanglement will cause the reverse, also self-amplifying disentanglement and extension process, leading 
to a quasi-homogeneous system state close to the initial configuration of noninteracting protofields that 
will naturally be followed by another collapse to the next, also randomly chosen reduction centre, and so 
on. This is the detailed, dynamically inevitable mechanism of realisation change within a generic process 
of unreduced interaction [21-27]. One obtains thus the infinite series of cycles of protofield reduction-
extension to randomly chosen successive reduction centres that form the dynamical space structure. We 
designate  this  spatially  chaotic,  essentially  nonlinear  pulsation  in  the a priori homogeneous system of 
interacting  protofields  as  quantum  beat  process  and  argue  that  it  constitutes  the  complex-dynamical 
internal structure, and the very essence, of any massive elementary particle, exemplified by the electron 
as the simplest species. 
 
Note  the  role  of  the  above  transient,  extended  state  of  quasi-free  components  during  system 
transition  between  two  successive,  localised  realisations:  it  constitutes  the  specific,  “intermediate”  (or 
“main”)  realisation, which has appeared in the above analysis of the unreduced solution (in relation to 
eq.  (12)),  enters  explicitly  that  solution  [20-25],  and  forms  the  unified  dynamical  “link”  and 
probabilistically  structured  (chaotically  changing)  “distribution  ground”  for all other, regular, localised 
realisations.  As  confirmed  below,  this  intermediate  realisation  forms  the  physically  real,  causally 
complete  version  of  the  famous  quantum-mechanical  wavefunction  possessing  all  the  necessary 
properties, “inexplicable” in the unitary theory, and universally extendible to any higher complexity level 
(see  also  refs.  [20-25]).  In  particular,  the wave-particle duality is dynamically obtained in the form of 
permanent  change  between  the  squeezed,  or  “corpuscular”,  and  extended,  or  “undular”,  states  of  the 
quantum  beat  process  within  any  (massive)  elementary  particle  that  can  therefore  be called also field-
particle  (this  dynamic  alternation  of  the  two  kinds  of  state  is  naturally  reproduced  in  quantum 
                                                
3Note  also  the  mathematical  “cutting”  role  of  the  “overlap  integrals”  in  the  numerators  of  eqs.  (16),  (17)  and  the 
, in the form of highly localised, 
convenient choice of the eigenfunctions of the initial expansion basis in eq. (3),

interaction  processes  of  elementary  field-particles,  see  below).4  As  we  have  seen,  the  intrinsically 
probabilistic nature of the wavefunction, remaining its most “mysterious” property in all unitary theory 
versions  (especially  in  combination  with  its  quite  real  “material”  manifestations,  such  as  diffraction), 
becomes also inevitable, dynamical consequence of the unreduced, dynamically multivalued interaction, 
where  the  canonical  Born's  probability  rule,  used  for  practical  determination  of  regular  realisation 
probabilities, follows directly from the dynamical “matching conditions” between the wavefunction and 
its  dynamically  squeezed  product,  eq.  (16)  [20-25].  The  wavefunction  represents  natural  dynamical 
averaging between regular realisations performed, in agreement with the expectation value expression of 
eq.  (15),  within  the  “intermediate”  realisation  by  the  unreduced  system  dynamics  itself.  Note  that 
actually it is only that, “averaged”, or “main”, system realisation which remains within its conventional, 
dynamically  single-valued  (unitary)  description,  while  its  intrinsic  dynamical  links  to  permanently 
appearing  and  disappearing  “regular”  (localised)  realisations,  as  well  as  those  realisations  themselves, 
are arbitrarily thrown off (and then formally reinserted, in the form of “corpuscular properties” to ensure 
“agreement  with  experiment”,  but  at  the  expense  of  postulated  “quantum  mysteries”,  “relativistic 
paradoxes”, irreducible separation from reality and inevitable ruptures within the theory). 
The elementary realisation change (reduction-extension) cycle constitutes the causally specified 
 
and  universally  applicable  essence  of  physical  event,  where  the  rigorously  derived  qualitative  system 
transformation, in the form of internal, highly nonuniform (nonlinear) reconstruction, plays the crucial 
role  and  shows  why  events,  and  with  them  physical  time  concept,  cannot  be  consistently  introduced 
within  the  conventional,  dynamically  single-valued  projection  of  reality.  Since  we  have  explicitly 
obtained  the  well-specified  sequence  of  essentially  nonlinear  events  of  unceasing,  qualitative,  and 
spatially  chaotic  change,  we  obtain  also  the  consistent  entity  of  real  physical  time  measured  by 
intensity  (appearing  as  frequency)  of  realisation  change  process  and  possessing  the  inherent, 
dynamically  derived  property  of  irreversibility  with  its  two  aspects  of  (1)  unceasing flow (realisation 
change)  and  (2)  intrinsic  unpredictability  (randomness)  of  each  next  step  (i.  e.  time  flow  direction 
towards growing total randomness naturally identified with growing dynamic entropy). 
 
In  that  way  we  have  derived  the  minimum  necessary  basis  for  the  consistent  introduction  of 
unreduced  dynamic  complexity,  C,  which  can  now  be  universally  defined  [21,22,26]  as  a  growing 
function  of  the  number  of  system  realisations,  N´
,  or  rate  of  their  change,  equal  to  zero  for  the

  (this  definition  remains  valid  only  if  the  unreduced,  dynamically  multivalued 
n
structure  of  a  system  or  interaction  process  is  explicitly obtained with all its internal dynamical links). 
The above explicitly derived spatial structure and temporal change are main universal manifestations of 
the unreduced dynamic complexity and give rise to any other observed feature of world structure and 
 and 
dynamics: a consecutive realisation change “produces” the physically real space element 
,  where  n   is  the  frequency  (expressing  intensity)  of  realisation  change 
time  increment 
process  and  c  is  the  velocity  of  perturbation  propagation  in  system.  Since  the  simplest  independent 
combination of space and time is given by action, A, we obtain the extended interpretation of action as

4The  realistic,  complex-dynamical  mechanism  of  quantum  duality  is  naturally  extended  to  the  causally  complete 
interpretation of the more general concept of conventional “complementarity” introduced by Niels Bohr and known for its 
particular obscurity, even with respect to other “quantum mysteries”. Namely, the extended complementarity refers to the 
intrinsically  complementary  character  of  the  unreduced,  multivalued  interaction  dynamics  which,  contrary  to  its 
dynamically  single-valued  projection,  dynamically  unites  such  contradictory  properties  as  locality  (“structures”)  and 
nonlocality  (“transitions”),  continuity  and  discreteness  (quantization  into  realisations),  regularity  (configuration  of  each 
realisation)  and  randomness  (realisation  emergence  and  sequence),  entanglement  (mixture)  and  disentanglement 
(separation), quanticity and classicality (see refs. [17-27] for more details).

each  realisation  change  cycle  is  described  by  an  action  increment 
,  where  the 
coefficients, E and p, are identified as energy and momentum. 
 
Since  in  the  case  of  quantum  beat  dynamics  one  deals  with  the  elementary,  most  fundamental 
world structure emergence, it is impossible to observe and measure the continuous, detailed course of 
the  process.  Observed  effects  and  measurements  start  from  the  whole  realisation  change  (reduction-
extension) cycle of quantum beat, providing the basis and realistic explanation for quantization (see also 
below), only formally introduced in the conventional theory. It becomes clear also that at those lowest,

“quantum” complexity levels the elementary action-complexity increment 
constant, and one obtains the causally complete explanation of both the fixed, finite value of h (effective 
indivisibility of the quantum beat cycle) and its universality for a very wide range of elementary entities 
and phenomena (first level of interaction between the same two protofields) [19], which is also taken for

the  autonomous  complex-dynamical  mechanism  of  quantum  beat  and  giving  rise  to  the  most 
fundamental  level  of  the  world  time  [22].  In  agreement  with  the  above  complexity  definition,  system 
energy thus defined represents a (differential) measure of dynamic complexity (whose integral measure 
is given by action  A ). 
It is not difficult to see also that the spatially chaotic distribution of the consecutive dynamical 
 
reduction centres of the quantum beat process within the elementary field-particle provides it with the 
universally  defined  property  of  mass  remaining  ambiguous  within  any  unitary  theory.  Indeed,  the 
quantum beat process can be considered as chaotic wandering of the squeezed, corpuscular state of the 
field-particle,  also  called  virtual  soliton  [22-25],  within  its  wavefunction,  which  possesses  the  basic 
property  of  inertia  in  the  form  of  resistance  to  change  of this chaotic motion, already existing within 
any (massive) particle, in agreement with the heuristic concept of “hidden thermodynamics” of a single 
0E ,  possesses, 
particle  introduced  by  Louis  de  Broglie  [32].  Therefore  the  field-particle  rest  energy, 
together  with  the  underlying  quantum  beat  process,  the  intrinsic  property  of  inertia  and  should  be

proportional to the rest mass,

dynamic origin of de Broglie's “periodic phenomenon” attached to a particle-“mobile” (quantum beat), 
which includes a localised entity (our virtual soliton), and of the intrinsic link between them, eq. (19). 
Now, if the field-particle is set in motion, its energy-complexity grows over the minimum of rest 
 
energy corresponding to the homogeneous distribution of realisation probabilities (see eq. (14a)), while 
its action-complexity acquires a coordinate dependence characterising an inhomogeneous distribution of 
realisation  probabilities  within  the  globally  moving  quantum  beat  process,  so  that  eq.  (18)  for  the

by  eq.  (22)  is  none  other  than  the  de  Broglie  wave  of  the  particle  with  the  wavelength 
,  now 
understood thus as the main result of the complex-dynamical (multivalued and probabilistic) structure 
formation process, at this complexity sublevel [18-25]. This structure emerges as the averaged, regular 
part  of  the  globally  moving  quantum  beat,  described  by  the  second  summand  in  the  particle  energy 
partition  of  eq.  (20),  whereas  the  first  summand  accounts  for  the  totally  irregular  (homogeneous  in 
average) virtual soliton wandering “around” that average tendency. At the same time, every single jump 
of the virtual soliton preserves its dynamically probabilistic character, so that the whole content of the 
total  energy  possesses  the  property  of  inertia,  which  provides  the  causal  explanation  and  intrinsic 
unification of the respective “relativistic” and quantum properties. 
 
Since the two tendencies in the quantum beat dynamics of a globally moving particle, the regular 
global displacement of the wave field and the irreducible random wandering of the virtual soliton around 
it,  form  the  single  complex-dynamical  (multivalued)  process,  another  dynamic  relation,  properly 
reflecting that essential link, should be added to the structure formation expression of eqs. (20)-(23). If 
we  introduce  the  velocity  of  light  c  as  the  velocity  of  physical  perturbation  propagation  through  the 
e/m protofield coupled to the gravitational protofield (as opposed to the postulated formal limitation of

relativistic  relation  between  energy  and  mass,  specifying  our  previous  assumption  in  eq.  (19)  and 
derived  from  the  underlying  complex,  multivalued  and  dynamically quantized, interaction dynamics. It 
provides the necessary completion for the original “phase accord” conjecture of Louis de Broglie [28], 
and we obtain the final expression for the de Broglie wavelength by combining eqs. (22) and (24):

A still larger implication of the causally derived dispersion relation of eq. (24) is that it provides, 
 
after  (discrete  or  continuous)  differentiation  with  respect  to  time,  the  rigorous  substantiation  for 
relativistic  version  of  Newton's  laws  of  “classical”  dynamics,  revealing  the  irreducible  role  of  the 
underlying  complex-dynamical  (multivalued)  structure  emergence  processes  and  including  causally 
complete  understanding  of  the  major  entities  of  space,  time,  energy,  mass,  and  momentum  as  various 
forms  and  measures  of  dynamic  complexity.  Due  to  universality of the above interaction development 
analysis, we can see that those laws and the underlying dispersion relation, eq. (24), remain valid at any 
complexity level, provided we have a uniform enough regime of interaction development, situated well 
outside of another complexity level emergence (such as relativistic particle transformations). 
 
Inserting  the  dispersion  relation  of  eq.  (24)  into  the  energy  partition  of  eq.  (20)  and  using  the 
universal  energy  definition  of  eq.  (21),  one  gets  the  basic  expression  of  time  relativity  revealing  its 
genuine, complex-dynamical origin:

We see that the causally defined time goes more slowly “within” a moving entity (T
physically  real  time  is  explicitly  produced  by  the  same  unceasing,  spatially  chaotic  realisation  change 
process  that  gives  rise to the global motion itself. A part of the quantum beat energy that goes to the 
global motion maintenance is deduced from the irregular component of dynamics just accounting for the 
“internal”  time of the moving system. In order to get the standard expression of time retardation with 
0t ,  we  use  an  additional  relation  between  the  motion

These relations express a physically transparent law of “conservation of the total number (frequency) of

The physical reality of de Broglie wave, obtained now as a result of dynamically multivalued structure 
formation  process  in  the system of two interacting protofields, is confirmed by the “ordinary” relation 
= v ,  which  comprises  a  nontrivial,  essentially 
ln
between  its  wavelength,  frequency,  and  velocity, 
nonlinear  and  causally  random,  internal  structure  of  the  dual,  undular  and  corpuscular,  protofield 
structures permanently transformed into one another and therefore preserving their “phase accord” [28-
=  
32].  It  is  not  difficult  to  see  from  eq.  (29)  [24,25]  that  the  quantities 
= - v
  represent  the  dynamically  obtained  realisation  probabilities  for,  respectively,  the  global 
1
(regular) and totally random tendencies in the moving field-particle dynamics, in full agreement with the 
general  definition  of  eq.  (14b),  which  confirms  once  more  the  intrinsic  unity  of  “quantum”  and 
“relativistic” manifestations of the unreduced interaction complexity. 
, 
 
is  known  as  system  Lagrangian.  The  energy  partition  of  eq.  (29)  provides  thus  the  causally  derived 
expression for the Lagrangian, together with its physical meaning of the purely random, “thermal” part 
of multivalued (chaotic) system dynamics taken with the opposite, negative sign:

The  latter  interpretation  leads to the causally derived, realistic extension of the canonical “principle of

postulates that principle and mechanistically “guessed” formal expression for the Lagrangian and action 
(see  e.  g.  [38,39]),  silently  adding  these  and  other  assumptions,  essentially  used  in  the  theory,  to  the 
explicitly announced “principle of relativity”. The obtained negative sign of the Lagrangian is a universal 
property  expressing  the  causally  derived  “arrow  of  time”  and  its  orientation  to  the  growing  dynamic

entropy  and  correspondingly  decreasing  dynamical  information,  just represented by action-complexity, 
so that their sum, the total system complexity, remains unchanged [21,22]. 
The  dynamically  multivalued  description  of  elementary  particle  dynamics  within  the  quantum 
 
field mechanics should be completed by explicit dynamic equation for the undular, wavefunctional state 
of the field-particle, causally introduced above (whereas the action-complexity and its derivatives refer 
mainly  to  the  corpuscular  state  of  virtual  soliton).  This  wave  equation  is  obtained  with  the  help  of 
causal  quantization  procedure  [19,20,22,24,25]  that  summarises  the  quantum  beat  dynamics  through 
the fact that it returns to effectively the same state of wavefunction (intermediate realisation) after each 
reduction-extension  cycle.  It  corresponds  to conservation of the total system complexity expressed by 
the  product  of  the  action-complexity  of  the  corpuscular state, A, and that of the wavefunction, Y , so

since the characteristic value of A in each cycle is equal to a fixed portion of h, such as 
. The 
latter quantity is then additionally multiplied by the imaginary unit, i, which does not change the physical 
sense of quantization and accounts for the difference between wave and corpuscular states in the wave

The causally substantiated version of the differential, “Dirac” quantization rules is then obtained by using 
the above definitions of momentum, eq. (22), and energy, eq. (21):

 is the rest-frame “circular” frequency of the quantum beat (which accounts 
where 
actually for the spin vorticity twist [22-25], see also below). More elaborated forms of wave equation, 
taking into account particle interactions, can be obtained within the same causal quantization procedure 
[22],  endowing  the  formally  identical  canonical  versions  with  the  realistic,  complex-dynamical 
substantiation.  In  the  nonrelativistic  limit  they  are  reduced  to  the  Schrödinger  equation,  but  provided

It  is  not  difficult  to  show  [22]  that  for  binding  potentials  eq.  (35)  can  be  satisfied  only  for  discrete 
,  marked  by  integer  numbers  of  the  same  action-complexity  quantum,  h,  that 
configurations  of 
describes one quantum-beat cycle, or “system realisation change”, which explains the famous quantum-
mechanical  “energy-level  discreteness”  by 
the  universal  complex-dynamical  discreteness  (or 
quantization)  of  the  underlying  interaction  process.  This  means  also  that  the  famous  quantum-
mechanical “linear superposition” of eigenfunctions and respective eigenvalue probabilities, including the 
particular case of “quantum entanglement” for a many-body system, reflects multivalued dynamics of the 
underlying interaction, where the system performs an unceasing series of reduction-extension cycles (or 
“quantum  jumps”)  between  the  corresponding  eigen-states  (see  eqs.  (13),  (15)-(17))  with  the 
dynamically  predetermined  probabilities  (eqs.  (14)).  The  quasi-linearity  of  wavefunction  behaviour 
(with  the  exception  of  its  probabilistic  interpretation)  is  due  to  the  transiently  weak,  perturbative 
interaction  character  only  within  that  particular,  intermediate  system  realisation  that  constitutes  the 
physical basis for the wavefunction (see above), whereas the measured eigenvalue emergence from the 
intermediate  realisation,  hidden  within  the  “inexplicable”  conventional  postulates,  is  due  to  the 
essentially nonlinear and physically real creation of the respective regular realisations. 
Any  “intrinsic”  property  of  the  elementary  field-particle  can  be  consistently  explained  within 
 
realistic,  but  irreducibly  complex,  essentially  nonlinear  quantum-beat  dynamics.  Thus,  the  property  of 
spin  results  from  “shear  instability”  of  the  squeezed  protofield  dynamics,  which  leads  to  the  highly 
nonlinear  vorticity  emergence,  similar  to  a  weakly  nonlinear  case  of  a  liquid  escaping  through a small 
hole from a basin under the influence of gravity [22] (and similar to water twist, the actual direction of 
spin  vorticity  may  be  due  to  a  weak  twist,  or  “CP”,  asymmetry  of  the  driving  protofield  interaction). 
The same rest energy of a particle, eq. (18), can then be presented, for example for a spin-1/2 particle 
s = ℏ
 is the spin angular momentum for each phase 
like electron, as 
of  reduction  or  extension of the quantum beat dynamics. The particle magnetic moment and magnetic 
field also originate naturally from the same quantum beat vorticity in the extension phase [22]. 
 
The  property  of  electric  charge  expresses  the  (long-range)  interaction  between  individual 
quantum  beat processes through the common e/m medium. In view of the well-known proportionality 
relation  between  the  squared  elementary  charge,  e,  and  Planck's  constant  ℏ, 
  (where 
a »
 is the famous fine structure constant), it becomes clear that e expresses the same dynamically 
discrete structure of protofield interaction complexity as h (corresponding to one cycle of the quantum 
beat),  but  now  with  respect  to  phase-sensitive  e/m  interactions  between  different  quantum  beat 
processes. Universal quantization of electric charge in units of e acquires thus a dynamic, causal origin,

of  existing  kinds  of  charge,  explained  by  the  universal  complex-dynamical  phase  synchronisation  of 
individual quantum beat processes up to the opposite phase (the quantum beat processes with opposite 
phases  just  appear  as unlike, “opposite” charges, dynamically attracted to each other) [22]. In accord 
with  the  above  physically  real  origin  of time, the same quantum beat synchronisation accounts for the

 is the Compton wavelength of the elementary field-particle with the rest mass m0 and 
electric  charge  e  (actually  represented  by  the  electron  or  positron).  The  electron  rest  energy  can  be 
considered thus as a sum of 
 e/m interactions between two elementary charges at a distance 
.  But  since  multivalued  quantum  beat  dynamics  consists  of  virtual  soliton  jumps  between  its

realisations  (reduction  centres),  we  can  consistently  interpret  the  above  relation  by  deducing  that

number  of  possible  reduction  centre  positions  for  the  electron  or,  equivalently,  the  number  of  the 
constituent  virtual  photons  in  the  extended  phase.  We  obtain  thus  the  new,  intrinsic  and  complex-
dynamical  meaning  for  both  Compton  length  and  fine  structure  constant.  It  implies,  in  particular, that 
the fine structure constant,

In that way one obtains the realistic interpretation of Planck's constant as the “volume” of EP 
 
realisation well for the protofield interaction, i. e. the product of the EP well depth and width, for any 
kind  of  elementary  particle  (emerging  by  the  complex-dynamical  interaction  development  described 
above),  which  explains  the  very  large  universality  of  h  and  the  origin  of  different  particle  species  as 
various  complex-dynamical  realisations  of  protofield  interaction  with  different  EP  depths  and  widths, 
but permanent product of the two [19]. While the electron emerges as a massive field-particle with the 
  and  smallest  a ,  m0,  and  e2),  the  heaviest,  “strongly” 
widest  and  most  shallow  EP  well  (largest  N ´
  ∼ ) and its biggest 
N a
,
interacting particles will correspond to the most narrow EP widths (effective 
depths (maximum measured m0 and “self-interaction” values). Two higher “generations” of elementary 
particles  emerge  as  “excited”,  and therefore more chaotic (less stable), protofield EP realisations with 
increased  amplitude  (and  correspondingly  decreased  widths),  where  the  phenomenon  of  dynamic 
multivaluedness  explains  the  very  fact  of  multiple  generations  existence,  remaining  otherwise 
“mysterious”  in  the  unitary  theory  framework,  as  well  as  the  origin  and  basic  features  of  the  particle 
spectrum in general (see also ref. [40] for possible further elaboration of the detailed particle properties 
in a realistic framework inspired by quantum field mechanics). Since (extended) action represents, as we 
have  seen,  the  universal  measure  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity,  it  is  clear  why  the  magnitude  of 
protofield  interaction  is  fixed,  in  the  most  universal  sense,  as an action constant: the latter determines 
actually  the  quantity  of  “latent”,  “potential”  complexity,  or  “dynamic  information”,  or  “protofield 
separation work”, that must be “invested” into the protofield system (in the form of mutually attracting 
protofield  separation)  in  order  that  it  can  produce  the  observed  world  structure  and  properties,  in 
agreement with the universal symmetry (conservation) of  complexity [21,22]. 
 
The  origin,  number,  and  properties  of  the  fundamental  interaction  forces  between  individual 
elementary particles are also causally and naturally derived within the quantum field mechanics, together 
with  their  intrinsic,  dynamic  unification.  Two  most  universal,  long-range  forces,  the  e/m  and 
gravitational  interactions  emerge  as  inevitable  interactions  between  individual  quantum  beat  processes 
transmitted  through,  respectively,  the  common  e/m  and  gravitational  protofields  starting  from 
deformations  that  arise  around  every  quantum  beat  pulsation. The detailed e/m interaction mechanism 
involves  causally  extended,  realistic  exchange of real  “virtual” (transient) photons between different 
quantum  beats,  where  photons  are  obtained  as  practically  massless  (but  probably  very  slightly 
dissipative),  dynamically  quantized,  and  shallow-EP  excitations  of  the  e/m  protofield  stabilised  by  its 
interaction  (weak  enough  for  this  case)  with  the  gravitational  protofield.  The  absence  of  gravitational 
analogue of e/m repulsion shows that the gravitational protofield is qualitatively different, by its physical 
nature,  from  the  e/m  protofield  and  resembles  rather  a  very  dense  and  “viscous”  medium,  where  all 
“waves” transmitting interactions quickly decay as such, together with their phases that remain essential 
for the case of highly “elastic” e/m protofield (it is easy to see that such kind of difference between the 
“materials”  of  the  two  protofields  should  exist  in  any  case for the efficient structure formation during 
their interaction, which devaluates all the resource-consuming efforts of the conventional science around 
long-range  gravitational  wave  detection  and  conventional  quantization  of  gravity).  The  general, 
averaged “tension” is, however, always transmitted through the gravitational medium, giving rise to the 
universal  gravitation.  Two  other,  short-range  interaction  types,  the  “strong”  and  “weak”  interactions 
are conveniently explained as short-range interaction forces between the discrete structure elements of 
the gravitational and e/m protofields, respectively. This leads us immediately to the conclusion about the 
physical origin of the gravitational medium that appears to be a sort of “quark matter”, or “condensate”,

thus  providing  the  natural,  physical  unification  between  gravity  and  “strong”  interaction  as  between 
long-  and  short-range  interactions  in  the  same  medium,  analogous  to  the  known  “electro-weak” 
unification,  which  is  only  formally  established  in  the  conventional  theory,  but  now  can  be  causally 
understood  as  physically  unified  long-  and  short-range  interactions  within  the  e/m  protofield.  The 
number  of  fundamental  forces  types  (four),  their  origin  and  properties  appear  thus  exactly  as  they 
should  be for the interaction between two physically real protofields, where the forces can be (quasi-) 
symmetrically  grouped  into  two  couples  by  two  principles,  according  to  either  their  “protofield  of 
origin”, or range of transmission (universality of perception). Moreover, all the four forces are naturally 
and dynamically unified from the beginning within the quantum beat process (actually in its realisation 
for  “strongly”  interacting  particles),  where  the  direct,  complete  unification  is  attained  in  the  phase  of 
maximum  dynamical  squeeze  (for  the  heaviest  particles).  One  can  compare  this  physically  transparent 
and totally consistent kind of unification (suggesting, of course, further elaboration of details) with the 
purely formal and inevitably failing “unification” efforts in the conventional, unitary theory. 
 
It  is  clear  from  the  above  picture  that  each  emerging  interaction  between  quantum  beat 
processes has a dynamically discrete, naturally quantized origin, which is especially important, however, 
for the case of gravity that escapes any quantization attempts in the conventional theory. Moreover, it 
becomes clear why the geometric “model” and approach of the conventional general relativity cannot be 
efficient in the consistent description of the intrinsically chaotic (multivalued) quantum beat dynamics, 
representing  the  universal,  physically  real  mechanism  of  any  “quantization”,  while  the  purely  formal 
mixture  between  quantized,  tangible  space  and  irreversibly  flowing,  immaterial  time,  attempted  in  the 
standard  relativity  framework,  leads  to  deep  contradictions  on  any  scale.  By  contrast,  the  intrinsically 
quantized  gravity  of  the  quantum  field  mechanics  naturally  leads  to  the  main  observed  effects  of 
“relativistic”  gravitation  on  a  macroscopic  scale,  which  do  not  originate  in  the  abstract,  formally 
imposed postulates and “principles”, but causally emerge from the same unreduced, complex dynamics 
of  interaction  between  the  two  protofields  that  gives  particles  themselves  and  their  causally  explained 
“quantum  weirdness”  and  effects  of  “special”  relativity,  thus  providing  the  intrinsically  unified  (and 
essentially complex-dynamical) framework for the whole fundamental physics, helplessly missing in the 
standard, unitary theories [22,24,25]. Thus, the major effect of time retardation in the gravitational field 
is  causally  derived in our approach as the quantum beat frequency dependence on the local tension of 
the  gravitational  protofield  created  by  other  field-particles  and  expressed  as  the  gravitational  field 
“potential”:

Another  important  result  related  to  causal  gravity  is  “renormalisation”  of  the  conventional 
Planckian  units  and  solution  of  the  “hierarchy”  problem  in  the  elementary  particle  spectrum  [22,25], 
among  many  other  modifications  involved  with  those  units.  The  problem  arises  from  the  fact  that  the 
unitary  theory  always  replaces  the  absent  real,  dynamic  origin  of  phenomena  by  formal,  mechanistic 
plays  with  parameters  and  thus,  in  particular, confuses the ordinary gravitational constant, used in the 
“dimensional”  derivation  of  the  standard  Planckian  units  and  accounting  for  indirect  gravitational

interaction  between  different  particles,  with  the  parameters  of  the  underlying  direct  protofield 
interaction,  intrinsic  to  each  particle.  Since  the  direct  protofield  interaction  within  a  particle  is  much 
stronger  than  usual,  indirect  gravitational  interaction  between  particles,  the  ordinary  gravitational 
constant  in  the  Planckian  units  definition  should  be  replaced  by  a  much  higher  value (1033-1034 times 
higher),  which  leads  just  to  the  “right”  values  of  the  Planckian  units,  where  the  Planckian  mass  value 
coincides (by order of magnitude) with that of the heaviest known particles (~ 100 GeV), and the time 
and length units give the respective observed values [22,25]. This result, obtained without contradictory 
introduction of unobservable entities, such as “invisible dimensions”, reveals the true, physical meaning 
of  the  (new)  Planckian  units:  they  describe  the  respective  parameters  of  the  “extreme”,  highest-
magnitude  EP,  quantum  beat,  and  elementary  particle  realisation  for  the  given  protofield  interaction 
(fixed h value, see above). 
 
This intrinsic causality continues for all the more involved structures which unevenly emerge as 
“levels”  of  complexity-entropy,  progressively  growing  in  the  interacting  protofield  system  at  the 
expense  of  its  equally  decreasing  complexity-action,  or  “dynamic  information”  [17-27].  Thus,  the 
classical, permanently localised type of behaviour emerges as the next (higher) complexity level of an 
elementary  bound,  closed  system,  such  as  atom,  largely  due  to  the  dynamic  randomness  within  each 
constituent  quantum  beat  process  (several  bound  virtual  solitons  cannot  perform  an  extended  bound 
walk  with  a  non-negligible  probability  just  because  of  the  independent  chaoticity  of  the  individual 
quantum  beats).  This  is  the  simplest  manifestation  of  the  general  limiting  regime  of  “multivalued  self-
organisation”,  which  complements  the  opposite  case  of  “uniform  chaos”  (exemplified  by  the  isolated 
quantum beat process) and where, contrary to the conventional self-organisation, the true chaos persists 
and increases, but also becomes “confined” within a “regular” external shape [21,22]. 
In  a  similar  way,  the  unreduced,  dynamically  multivalued  analysis  of  nonbinding  interactions 
 
leads  to  the  causally  complete  theory  of  true  quantum  chaos  [21,22,26]  and  quantum  measurement 
[22,27]  (both  of  them  involving  genuine  randomness  of  the  same  fundamental  origin),  which  extends 
essentially  the  corresponding  conventional  theory  results,  suffering  just  from  the  absence  of  intrinsic 
source of randomness and dynamic entanglement in their unitary basis. Note also the causal solution of 
the famous quantum entanglement “mystery” of the standard theory through the dynamic, interaction-
driven entanglement (see discussions after eqs. (15) and (35)) and the ensuing clarification of the related 
quantum many-body problems [20-22]. 
 

3. Practical consequences and experimental confirmation 
of the quantum field mechanics 

 
Having  described,  in  the  previous  section,  the  fundamental  theoretical  framework  and  the 
 
ensuing  structure  of  reality,  we  can  now  present  a  summary  of  results  with  more  immediate  practical 
importance (many of them are mentioned above) and also those that provide experimental support for 
the  theory,  especially  vs  the  conventional  framework.  Practical  implications  of  the  quantum  field 
mechanics are described also in refs. [17-27,37] (see, in particular, section 3 in ref. [19]). 
 
(1)  The  first  “practical”  implication  to  be  noted  is  still  closer  to  the  unified  consistency  of  the 
quantum  field  mechanics  (see  the  end  of  the  previous  section),  which  is  actually  inseparable  from  the 
totality  of  observable  phenomena.  It  is  important  to  emphasize  the  difference  with  respect  to 
“experimental  verification”  criterion  of  the conventional theory, which prefers to emphasize separated 
points  of  purely  quantitative  agreement,  often  obtained  by  mechanistic  adjustment  of  the  desired 
number of “free” parameters and artificial, abstract entities, while at the same time it accepts, and often 

 

21 

tries to mask, its para-scientifically high and always growing number of strong qualitative contradictions 
and  deviations  from  reality,  which  are often even “postulated” in the form of allegedly “unavoidable”, 
and  actually  desirable,  “mysteries”.  The  causally  complete  analysis  of  the  universal  science  of 
complexity  shows  why  this  evident  intellectual  fraud  is  inevitable  just  within  the  “new”  fundamental 
physics that tries to realise the basically impossible unification of the explicit, strong manifestations of 
the  unreduced  complexity  (dynamic  multivaluedness  and  entanglement),  which  just  constitute  the  true 
essence  of  the  “new  physics”  phenomena,  with  the  dynamically  single-valued,  zero-complexity 
framework  of  its  unitary  theoretical  “paradigm”  (see  also  section  1).  By  contrast,  the  unreduced, 
complex-dynamical  description  of  reality  suggests  another,  causally  complete  kind  of  agreement  with 
the  observed  world  properties,  in  the  form  of  a  consistent  system  of  correlations,  including  explicit 
derivation  of  the  existing  real  entities  and  their  unreduced  properties,  where  qualitative  aspects  play 
even greater role, than separate cases of quantitative coincidence, since the former cannot be adjusted 
by a play with parameters (while the number of introduced entities should always remain at its provable 
minimum). 
 
Among most important general correlations obtained within the quantum field mechanics we can 
mention  the  number  of  space  dimensions  (three)  that  emerge  dynamically  from  the  same  number  of 
interaction entities (two protofields and interaction itself) due to the universal complexity conservation 
law (which can be causally justified and is supported by the totality of existing observations [22]). The 
unceasing and spatially chaotic time progress, naturally dualistic field-particles with universally defined 
mass, energy, electric charge, spin, unified quantum and relativistic properties without “mysteries”, the 
number and properties of dynamically unified interaction forces between particles, the intrinsic classical 
behaviour, true quantum chaos and dynamically probabilistic quantum measurement continue the list of 
explicitly  obtained  entities  and  unified  correlations  within  the  quantum  field  mechanics  (section  2), 
which minimises the probability of artificially “arranged” coincidence. 
(2)  Causally  substantiated  renormalisation  of  Planckian  units  and  explanation  of  the  observed 
 
particle  spectrum  (see  the  end  of  the  previous  section  and  refs.  [22,25]).  The  important  practical 
consequence here should be the essential change of accelerator research strategy and purposes, as well 
as  serious  modification  of  all  particle  and  quantum  physics  aspects  where  Planckian  units  play  an 
important  role.  The  same  refers  to  the  predicted  absence of the notorious Higgs particles, used in the 
conventional  theory  as  a  simplified  unitary  substitute  for  the  missing  concept  of  mass  (where  a 
characteristic  trick  of  the  mechanistic  knowledge  is  performed  in  the  form  of  substitution  of  an 
artificially  invented,  abstract  and  special  entity  for  the  tangibly  present,  universal  property,  in 
contradiction with Occam’s principle of parsimony and elementary consistency demand). Since we have 
explicitly obtained the intrinsic, complex-dynamical property of mass, the resource-consuming search of 
the conventional science for fictitious particles becomes definitely obsolete, while showing increasingly 
its practical uselessness already within the conventional research. The same actually refers to many other 
unitary  theory  substitutes  for  the  missing  fundamental  properties  (such  as those appearing in imitative 
unification  schemes  of  supersymmetry  and  string  theory),  which  substantiates  and  specifies  the 
inevitable, qualitative change of the whole research strategy in high-energy physics. 
(3)  Causal  classicality  emergence  and  macroscopic  quantum  effects.  Our  purely  dynamic 
 
mechanism  of  emergence  of  the  classical,  permanently  localised  type  of  behaviour  in  an  elementary 
closed  system,  in  the  form  of  a  new  level  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity  [17-25]  (see  the  end  of 
section  2),  is  confirmed  by,  and  practically  important  for,  both  transitions  from  quantum  to  classical 
behaviour and occasional “revival” of “quantum”, undular behaviour in large enough, normally classical 
systems  put  under  special  conditions.  The  detailed,  causally  complete  understanding  of  inevitable 

 

22 

transition from quantum to classical behaviour already on the smallest scales (atoms) is important for 
applications  like  nanotechnology  and  quantum  computation  that  involve  complicated  and  “entangled” 
enough  structure  of  the  system  and  its dynamics [21,22], so that “quantum measurement” and related 
classicality  emergence  cannot  be  separated  any  more  from  the  proper  “quantum”  dynamics  and 
especially expressed by contradictory and “inexplicable” postulates (as it was still possible for simplest 
systems,  though at the expense of the essential loss in consistency). Rejection of the realistic, causally 
complete  understanding  by  the  unitary  theory,  dominating  in  those  applications,  produces  a  huge 
misleading  effect  [21].  The  “reverse”  transition  to  quantum  behaviour  in  big  enough,  many-body 
systems  is  also  rich  in  practically  important  applications  and  needs  the unreduced problem solution of 
the  quantum  field  mechanics,  without  which  the  “clash”  of inconsistent unitary imitations reveals only 
ever deepening impasse of the conventional theory. In particular, the popular interpretation of classical 
behaviour  in terms of external “decoherence” enters in fundamental contradiction with abundance and 
diversity of the observed “quantum revival” effects that find, on the contrary, their natural explanation 
within the intrinsic, dynamical classicality version of the quantum field mechanics [17-25] (here again, 
the unitary theory tries to reduce the intrinsic property to an external entity influence). 
(4)  Realistic  “quantum”  machines  and  causally  substantiated  nanotechnology.  These  quickly 
 
growing and extremely versatile applications include the previous item, but actually provide, due to the 
irreducible involvement of complicated interaction configurations, the unified, many-sided verification of 
the whole micro-physics theory and “paradigm”. The necessity for change of the latter in favour of the 
unreduced  description  of  quantum  field  mechanics  (universal  science  of  complexity)  becomes  thus 
especially evident (see especially ref. [21] for details). We can mention the consistent theory of quantum 
(and  classical)  chaos [21,22,25] and quantum measurement [22,26] as examples of essential particular 
constituents of the emerging unified description, also inevitably absent in the unitary theory framework. 
(5)  Quantum  many-body  problems  with  irreducibly  “strong”  interaction.  Again  in  intersection 
 
with the above items, this group of applications derives from the “canonical” physical studies, but where 
the  particular  many-body  systems  of  interest  do  not  allow  any  more  for  the  use  of  usual  perturbative 
approaches and necessitate the unreduced, real interaction analysis, just provided by the quantum field 
mechanics (at the lowest levels of unreduced complexity). Indeed, it is easy to see [21] that the arbitrary 
many-body  problem  can  be  expressed  by  the  same  system  of  equations,  eqs.  (4),  as  the  protofield 
interaction  problem  considered  here  (which should be expected physically). Characteristic applications 
of  interest  include  more  complicated  solid-state  systems  with  “strong”  interaction  and  “correlated 
electrons” (high-temperature superconductivity, quantum Hall effect, etc.), quantum atomic condensates 
and  other  “macroscopic  quantum  effects”,  and  causally  complete  understanding  of  nuclear  dynamics 
(including true quantum chaos and nuclear stability estimate [19]). It appears, without any surprise, that 
such “difficult” cases of the “old” many-body problem can be successfully analysed only with the help of 
its  unreduced,  truly  non-perturbative  general  solution  for  the  arbitrary  interaction  case,  which  is 
uniquely  provided  by  the  unreduced  EP  method  (section  2)  and  contains  strong  qualitative  novelties 
with respect to any imitation of the fundamentally perturbative, unitary theory. 
(6)  Causally  complete  description  of  intrinsically  creative  cosmological  evolution.  Since  the 
 
conventional,  unitary  theory  does  not  possess  the  property  of  creativity  in  principle  (cannot  explicitly 
describe  the  autonomous,  intrinsic  structure  emergence  process),  its  application  to  cases  with  explicit 
structure emergence and related manifestations of unreduced complexity, like cosmology, produces the 
maximum number of mistakes and confusions. Due to the “intrinsically cosmological” character of the 
quantum  field  mechanics  (see  the  beginning  of  section  2),  it  “automatically”  provides  the  explicitly 
emerging structures, in their unreduced, realistic version, and thus naturally resolves, or even does not 

 

23 

contain, many “difficult”, old and new, problems of the unitary cosmology, such as the problem of the 
observed  universe  flatness,  or  that  of  the  “wavefunction  of  the  universe”  (classical  structure 
emergence), or the problem of time, or various problems of “quantum cosmology” (including “quantum 
gravity”),  etc.  The  essentially  modified,  complex-dynamical  basis  of  “relativistic”  behaviour  [17-25], 
briefly outlined in section 2, is naturally involved with the intrinsically creative, dynamical framework of 
the new cosmology, as opposed to the “geometric” and abstract approach of the corresponding unitary 
imitations, which do not accept any explicit structure formation in principle. The finally emerging “new” 
problems  of  dark  mass  and  dark  energy,  which  scandalously  seem  to  defy  the  very  conservation  of 
energy  and  matter,  only  summarise  the  dominating  deficiency (“darkness”) of the unitary, dynamically 
single-valued  models  used  to  simulate  the  dynamically  multivalued  reality:  the  “missing”  entities  just 
correspond  to  the  majority  of  real-system  realisations  artificially  excluded  from  its  unitary  “models” 
within  the  conventional  cosmology.  The  related  fundamental  thesis  of  the  universe  appearance  “from 
nothing” of the conventional cosmology is equally overthrown by the unreduced interaction description, 
revealing the internal complexity transformation from dynamic information to entropy as the basic form 
of the universal symmetry (conservation) of complexity, underlying any real system creation, evolution 
and  dynamics  [21,22].  The  exact  (never  broken)  symmetry  of  complexity  is  the  basis  of  the  essential, 
causally  specified  world  progress,  from  two  coupled  homogeneous  protofields  to  the  fine-structured, 
conscious universe, while nothingness can produce only darkness, in science and in the real world. 
(7)  And  finally,  one  should  say  several  words  about  “direct”  theory  verification  by  “special” 
 
experiments, in the spirit of the conventional dogmata. The problem with the quantum world case is that 
one deals here with the lowest, intrinsically coarse-grained (or “quantum”) levels of the complex world 
dynamics,  which  necessarily  implies  balancing  at the border of quantitative resolution and ambiguous, 
never-ending  “interpretations”  of  technically  sophisticated  experiments  and  their  faint  results  (as 
opposed  to  clear  and  unified  qualitative  manifestations  of  unreduced  complexity,  emphasised  by  the 
quantum  field  mechanics).  While  the  problems  with  interpretation  of  “fine”  quantum  experiments  are 
well-known  and  do  not  seem  to  decrease  in  the  conventional  science  framework,  we  can  still  try  to 
complete  our  picture  with  discussion  of  some  experimental  possibilities  of  that  kind.  Because  of  the 
fundamental, dynamically obtained quantization of the unreduced interaction process, it is impossible to 
“catch”  the  basic  quantum  beat  dynamics  in  any  its  “intermediate”  stage  or  continuous  development. 
However,  one  can  think  about  some  indirect,  but  special  enough,  effects  of  this  dynamics  related,  in 
particular,  to  characteristic,  internal  resonances  occurring  at  certain  parameter  values.  Thus,  equality

charged particles in crystals should have a variety of observable, well-specified manifestations (see ref. 
[37]  for  details).  All  these  possibilities  do  seem  to  provide  a  potential  for  indirect,  but  convincing 
experimental  confirmation  of  the  quantum  field mechanics picture, essentially exceeding the ambiguity 
of  usual  “interpretational”  experiments  and  also  promising  novel  practical  applications,  involving  new 
ways of particle/energy transformation and structure analysis. A more direct observation of the virtual 
soliton wandering (or “diffusion”) within its wave is not impossible either, but can be more problematic 
in its technical realisation. 
In summary, the presented practical implications of the quantum field mechanics, items (1)-(7), 
 
seem to induce enough motivation for further development of the theory and related experiment. A real 
obstacle  for  further  progress  comes  rather  from  the  subjective  rigidity  of  the  conventional,  unitary 
science framework that does not want even to notice any true novelty, despite the evident devaluation 
of  its  own  methods  and  results.  The  successful  completion  of  the  present  project  will  hopefully 
contribute  to  positive  shift  towards  the  unreduced  creativity  in  both spirit and content of fundamental 
physics.

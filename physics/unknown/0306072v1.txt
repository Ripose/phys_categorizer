Abstract.  The  physical  mechanism  of  nuclear  reactions  at  low  energies  caused  by 
spatial  extension  of  electron  is  considered.  Nuclear  reactions  of  this  type  represent  intra-
electronic processes, more precisely, the processes occurring inside the area of basic localization 
of electron. Distinctive characteristics of these processes are defined by interaction of the own 
field  produced  by  electrically  charged  matter  of  electron  with  free  nuclei.  Heavy  nucleus, 
appearing  inside  the  area  of  basic  localization  of  electron,  is  inevitably  deformed  because  of 
interaction  of  protons  with  the adjoining layers of electronic cloud, which may cause nuclear 
fission. If there occur “inside” electron two or greater number of light nuclei, an attractive force 
appears  between  the  nuclei  which  may  result  in  the  fusion  of  nuclei.  The  intra-electronic 
mechanism of nuclear reactions is of a universal character. For its realization it is necessary to 
have merely a sufficiently intensive stream of free electrons, i.e. heavy electric current, and as 
long  as  sufficiently  great  number  of  free  nuclei.  This  mechanism  may  operate  only  at  small 
energies of translational motion of the centers of mass of nuclei and electron. Because of the 
existence of simple mechanism of nuclear reactions at low energies, nuclear reactor turns out to 
be  an  atomic  delayed-action  bomb  which  may  blow  up  by  virtue  of  casual  reasons,  as  it  has 
taken  place,  apparently,  in  Chernobyl.  The  use  of  cold  nuclear  reactions  for  production  of 
energy  will  provide  mankind  with  cheap,  practically  inexhaustible,  and  non-polluting  energy 
sources.  

1.  Introduction 

Tell me what the electron is, and I shall 
explain to you everything else.

Nuclear  reactions  at  low  energies,  occurring  in  physical  and  biological  systems,  and,  in 
particular, the cold fusion (CF) of nuclei, attract ever increasing attention (see review articles [1,2]). 
This  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  research  on  CF  (in  what  follows,  by  cold  fusion  we  shall 
understand any nuclear reactions at low energies) opens up the way to the solution of the problem 
which was set more than 50 years ago in the field of controlled thermonuclear reactions (CTR) and 
which  has  not  been  solved  -  to  provide  mankind  with  cheap  fuel.  An  important  point  is  that  CF 
allows to create not only cheap, but also non-polluting energy sources, as nuclear reactions at low 
energies  are  not  accompanied  by  radiations  dangerous  to  health  (γ -radiations,  streams  of  fast 
neutrons and other particles). Note that the energetic problem facing mankind is presently of special 
interest in connection with the fact that, according to expert evaluations, the oil-and-gas resources in 
the  world  will  suffice  only  for  some  decades.  For  this  reason  the  study  of  CF  is  among  the  most 
important problems of physics. 

It  is  necessary  to  note  that,  relying  on  the  standard  theory  of  nuclear  reactions  describing 
nuclear  processes  in  vacuum,  experts  in  the  field  of  nuclear  physics,  engaged  in  CTR,  reject  the 

 

2 

very  possibility  of  existence  of  nuclear  fusion  at  low  energies.    Two  basic  objections  are  raised 
against CF: 

1.  at  low  energies  the  penetrability  of  Coulomb  barrier  around  nuclei  is  so  small  that  the 

probability of nuclear fusion is practically equal to zero; 

2.  distinction between the atomic and nuclear energy scales is so great that the energy, which 
might be evolved as a result of nuclear fusion, could not be transferred directly to atomic 
lattice; therefore the energy above should be emitted in the form of streams of  γ -quanta, 
fast  neutrons  and  other  particles.  However,  such  streams  of  sufficient  intensity  have  not 
been  registered. 

The answer to the first objection against existence of CF is that at the heart of CF are nuclear 
processes  occurring  in  environment,  and  the  basic  role  is  played  here,  apparently,  by  collective 
effects caused by interaction of nuclei with particles of environment in which the nuclear reaction 
takes place. The laws governing the behaviour of interacting nuclei in vacuum are inapplicable to 
the  description  of  CF  of  nuclei  [3].  Nuclear  reactions  occurring  at  low  energies  submit  to 
completely different laws which can be established only provided that collective effects mentioned 
above are taken into account. For this reason the standard theory of nuclear reactions in vacuum can 
by no means  refute the existence of CF. 

As  to  the  impossibility  of transferring the energy between levels of various scales,  we can 
give an example of the phenomenon of sonoluminescence (luminescence of a liquid when a sound 
wave causing cavitation passes through it) [4], in which the energy transfer from an acoustic wave 
to electromagnetic field occurs with appreciable probability in spite of the fact that the distinction 
between energies of acoustic phonons and quanta of light reaches 11 orders.  

As early as 10 years ago J. Schwinger, the Nobel winner and the known expert in the field of 
the  theory  of  elementary  particles  and  quantum  electrodynamics,  asserted  that  it  is  impossible  to 
deny the reality of CF phenomenon [3,4]. Since then the CF phenomenon for nuclei was repeated 
hundreds times in laboratories all over the world, tens of patents on the ways of energy generation 
on  the  basis  of  CF  were  registered  and  enormous  number  of  experimental  works  were  published, 
which not only confirm the existence of effect, but also contain its detailed analysis.  

 The most convincing evidence for the existence of nuclear reactions at low energies seems 
to  give  the  mass-spectrometric  research  of  reaction  products  [5]  as  well  as  research  on  biological 
systems [6]. Detailed study of electric explosion of foil made of especially pure materials in water, 
described  in  [5],  suggests  that  at  electric  discharges  transformation  of  chemical  elements  occurs. 
Study of optical spectrum of plasma arising at discharge and of the mass-spectrometric analysis of   
sediments,  which  remained  after  the  discharge,  shows  that  there  appears  in  plasma  a  significant 
number  of  chemical  elements  which  were  not  present  in  the  initial  material  of  explosive  foil  and 
electrodes and also that the isotope structure of the foil material changes appreciably. The change of 
experimental conditions, for example, of energy contribution in foil, its mass and dimensions results 
only in redistribution of intensity of plasma spectral lines, i.e. in the change of statistical weight of 
chemical elements in plasma, but the composition of chemical elements remains unchanged and it 
essentially  depends  on  the material  of foil.  As  is seen from  the results received, nuclear reactions 
taking place at electric discharge are not accompanied by the occurrence of a stream of neutrons and 
γ -radiation and proceed at low energies of atomic nuclei.  

The research mentioned above as well as many others, carried out by different researchers 
in different laboratories, allow to draw a conclusion that existence of nuclear reactions at low 
energies is reliably established. 

The  development  of  research  on  CF  is  hampered  by  the  absence  of  theory  of  the 
phenomenon.  As  is  noted  by  Schwinger  [3,4],  the  situation  in  CF  closely  parallels  that  in  high-
temperature  superconductivity:  reality  of  the  last,  as  a  result  of  careful  experimental  research,  is 
completely established, though theory of the phenomenon is absent till now. 

In [5], to account for the transformation of chemical elements, the hypothesis is put forward 
that at the electric explosion of foil  in the plasma channel are formed magnetic monopoles which 

 

3 

may overcome the Coulomb barrier even at insignificant kinetic energy due to the great magnitude 
of their magnetic charge. The monopole, appearing not far from a nucleus, causes its polarization: 
those nucleons of the nucleus, which are situated more close to the monopole, experience stronger 
influence of the last, than the nucleons situated on the opposite side of the nucleus. As a result, a 
deformation of the nucleus arises (the nucleus is lengthened), which may result in nuclear fission. 

 Obvious drawback of this mechanism of nuclear reactions is that magnetic monopoles have 

yet to be found out in nature.  

Numerous attempts to construct a consistent theory of CF (see reviews [1,2]) have not been 
crowned  with  success.  As  it  was  noted  above,    for  the  CF  to  be  described,  the  account  of  the 
collective  effects  may  be  important  caused  by  interaction  of  nuclei  with  environment,  in  which   
nuclear reaction takes place. But does it suffice to take into account these effects in order that the 
theory  of  the  phenomenon  be  constructed?  The  analysis  of  the  experiments  on  transformation  of 
chemical elements at low energies and on the CF of nuclei suggests that the phenomenon discussed 
does not fall within the domains of exotic ones: it seems to occur in nature constantly, at every step, 
in both physical  and biological systems.  Therefore,  it is natural to expect that nuclear reactions at 
low energies should have a simple physical explanation.  

However such explanation, which is not beyond the scope of existing representations, is yet 
to be found. Doesn’t it mean that we are facing here the situation similar to that which has arisen in 
physics at the end of the 19th century and which has been figuratively described in the words: on 
the  light  sky  of  physics  there  are  only  two  small  dark  clouds  –  the  radiation  of  absolutely  black 
body and the Michelson experiments? Remind that in order for these clouds to be removed, it has 
taken the revision of physical notions about electromagnetic field as well as about space and time.  

As is noted in [8], there is a simple physical mechanism of nuclear transformations at low 
energies  whose  existence  follows  from  the  quantum  theory of electron as an open  self-organizing 
system [9]. If two or the greater number of light nuclei appear inside free electron, more precisely, 
inside the area of basic localization of the particle, because of interaction of nuclei with electrically 
charged  matter  of  electronic  cloud,  a  force  of  attraction  appears  between  the  nuclei  which  may 
result in fusion of nucleus. This means that cold nuclear reaction represents an intra-electronic 
process whose character is defined by physical properties of the own field produced  by electrically 
charged  matter  of  electron.  The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  more  detailed  consideration  of  the  
mechanism above stemming from the spatial extension of electron. 

In  section  2  physical  ideas  are  formulated  and  basic  results  are  schematically  presented  of 
quantum theory of electron as an open self-organizing system. The theory outlined is necessary to 
elucidate the origin of the mechanism resulting in the occurrence of nuclear reactions of fusion and 
fission  at  low  energies.  The  essence  of  the  approach  developed  consists  in  that  the  own  field 
created  by  electron  is  treated  as  a  congenital,  integral  physical  property  of  electron, 
intrinsically inherent in the particle by the very nature of things and for this reason the own 
field  and  self-action  are  included  in  the  definition  of  the  particle  at  the  initial  stage  of 
formulating  the  theory.  As  is  seen  from  the  results  received,  electron  represents  a  quantum 
(elementary excitation) of the field of electrically charged matter. It is a soliton, whose physical and  
geometrical properties are described by the non-linear and non-local dynamical equation similar to 
the known Dirac equation.  

In  section  3  the  application  of  quantum  model  of  self-organizing  electron  to  nuclear 
reactions at low energies is considered. It is noted that because of the presence of simple physical 
mechanism of nuclear reactions at low energies, which is of a universal character, nuclear reactors 
represent, in effect,  nuclear delayed-action bombs which from time to time may blow up by virtue 
of the casual reasons.  Hence, though nuclear stations may provide mankind with energy, however 
atomic  engineering  is  a  very  dangerous  way  of  energy  production.  The  only  acceptable  way  of 
solving the energetic problem consists in the use of nuclear reactions at low energies.

2.  Quantum model of electron as an open self-organizing system 

The basis for the standard formulation of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is the hypothesis  
that electron is a structureless point particle which does not experience self-action. This assumption 
results in serious difficulties – the divergences of mass and charge of electron and the impossibility 
to explain stability of the particle (see, for example, [10-12]).  

The  difficulties  mentioned  above  are  very  serious.  According  to  Dirac,  the  difficulties  of 
QED “in view of their fundamental character can be eliminated only by radical change of the 
foundations  of  the  theory,  probably,  radical  to  the  same  extent  as  transition  from  the  Bohr 
orbits  theory  to  modern  quantum  mechanics”  ([13],  p.  403).  “Correct  conclusion”,  Dirac 
emphasizes, “is that  the basic equations are incorrect. They should be changed in such a way that 
divergences do not appear at all”.  

The main reason of occurrence of difficulties is the assumption that electron is a point-like 
particle.  Therefore,  abandonment  of  this  hypothesis  is  inevitable.  As  an  analysis  of  the  problem 
shows,  the  key  to  constructing  a  consistent  quantum  theory  of  electromagnetism  lies  in  taking 
account  of  the  Coulomb  self-action  of  electron,  i.e.  the  back  action  of  the  own  field  created  by 
charged particle in environmental space upon the same particle.  In the special case that the particle 
is at rest in an inertial reference frame, own field of the particle turns into static Coulomb field.

One  of  the  boldest  ideas  concerning  the  problem  of  electron  was  put  forward  by 
E.Schrödinger  who  suggested  the  historically  first  physical  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics.

According  to  Schrödinger’s  hypothesis,  the  quantity 
function  of  electron,  respectively)  is  the  density  of  spatial  distribution  of  electron’s  charge  and, 
consequently, the linear sizes of electron are the same as those of atom [14,15]. However, they 
did  not  succeed  in  substantiating  the  interpretation  and,  for  this  reason,  it  was  rejected  by  the 
majority of physicists [16]. 
 
An important step to correct understanding of the physical nature of electron was made by 
A.  Barut  and  his  collaborators  [16-18]  who  formulated  and  developed  quantum  theory  of 
electromagnetic  processes  on  the  basis  of  self-energy  picture  (the  Self-Field  QED).  Using 
expression for the total own energy of electron, they managed to calculate the Lamb shift and other 
radiative corrections and to show that radiative phenomena may be described in terms of the action 
function,  without  using  the  second  quantization  method.  As  is  pointed  out  by  Barut  [17],  “the 
correct  quantum  equation  of  motion  for  radiating  electron  is  not  the  Dirac  or  the  Schrödinger 
equation for bare electron, but an equation containing an additional non-linear self-energy term”. 

 Let us outline schematically the results of the formulation of quantum electrodynamics in 

New lines of approach to the problem of electron are offered in [9, 19-24]. The formulation 
of electrodynamics is considered which represents a synthesis of standard quantum electrodynamics 
and  ideas  of  the  theory  of  self-organization  [25].  The  physical  mechanism  of  self-organization  of 
electron consists in self-action. Taking into account the self-action means that electron is treated as 
a feedback system.  
 
which electron is an open self-organizing system.    
 How  can  the  self-action  of  electron  be  described?  It  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  the 
 
electric  charge  density  of  electron  should  be  described  by  a  continuous  function  of  coordinates 
which assumes everywhere finite values and owing to this the own energy of the particle should be 
finite.  One  of  the  hints  as  to  how  to  describe  the  self-action  of  electron  and,  hence,  to  remove 
divergence  of  self-energy  can  be  obtained  from  Maxwell’s  equations  for  electromagnetic  field.

It  follows  from  the  last  equalities  that  the  Coulomb  field 
||E   is  not  an  independent  degree  of 
freedom of electromagnetic field:  it is created by charged particle and cannot exist in its absence. 
Hence,  the  Coulomb  field  should  be  included  in  the  definition  of  the  particle.  This  idea  can  be 
realized  on  the  basis  of  the  action  principle  by  including  the  self-action  of  electron  in  the 
Lagrangian function already in the zero-order approximation. 

Obviously,  when  deriving  the  equation  of  motion  for  self-acting  electron  from  the  action

An  analysis  shows,  however,  that  equation  (6)  has  no  solutions  satisfying  necessary  physical 
requirements.  From  the  physical  point  of  view,  this  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Coulomb  forces  of 
repulsion acting inside electron  tend to tear the particle to pieces. Formally, this is explained by the 
fact that potential energy  U  (7) represents a potential hump rather than the potential well. For this 
reason equation (6) cannot have solutions describing stable states of electron.

Thus,  the  negative  result  is  received:  we  have  tried  to  take  into  account  self-action  of 
electron in a natural way by supplementing the Lagrangian function with the self-energy term, but 
we came to an equation that has no reasonable physical solutions at all. This result seems to mean 
that the standard theoretical scheme reaches here the limits of its applicability and so, remaining in 
its framework, it is impossible to solve the problem of electron and elucidate the physical nature of 
electromagnetic interaction.  

Essentially  new  point  which  is  introduced  in  [9]  into  quantum  mechanics  consists  in  the 
replacement  of  the  model  of  isolated  system  described  by  harmonic  oscillator  with  the  model  of 
open system. Let us advance the arguments indicating the inevitability of using the model of open 
system as a basis of the description of interaction between microparticles [26]. 

Note,  first  of  all,  that  quantum  particle  theory  based  on  the  use  of  the  models  of  isolated 
system is, strictly speaking, physically meaningless. Really, any observation conducted on a system 
represents  a  process  of  interaction  of  the  system  with  the  means  of  observation.  But  in  case  of 

 

6 

microparticles (quantum particles) this interaction is not weak and consequently it is inadmissible to 
neglect it, i.e. microparticles should be necessarily considered as essentially non-isolated systems. 
 
Starting  point  of  the  standard  formulation  of  quantum  mechanics  is  the  physical  idea  that 
interaction  between  physical  fields  can  be  reduced  to  collision  of  the  particles  corresponding  to 
these  fields,  the  particles  before  and  after  collision  being  considered  as  free  ones.  According  to 
these  representations,  quantum  mechanics  is  based  on  the  notions  of  “bare”,  non-interacting 
particles, with the interaction between them being considered as an additional factor which can only 
insignificantly alter the physical properties of non-interacting particles. However, such an approach 
to  interaction  between  physical  fields  is  obviously  of  an  idealized  character  because  particles 
constantly  interact  “with  vacuum  as  with  some  kind  of  physical  medium  in  which  the  particles 
move” [27]. Interaction of particles with vacuum fluctuations is not small and it cannot be removed.  
It is well also to bear in mind that the necessary intermediary at studying micro-objects are 
the means of observations (the devices) with the classical field corresponding to them which should 
be  taken  into  account  in  consistent  quantum  theory  [28].  Inclusion  in  theoretical  scheme  of 
arbitrarily weak classical external field results in occurrence of non-zero width  Γ  of energy levels 
of “dressed” particles. The basic impossibility to isolate a real particle from vacuum fluctuations of 
the field and from the classical sources connected to the means of observation is indicative, thus, of 
necessity to take into account the non-zero width of energy levels of real particles [26].  

the 

The  use  of 

interaction  of 
the  harmonic  oscillator  model,  when  describing 
electromagnetic radiation with substance, seems to be the main source of serious difficulties of the 
standard  formulation  of  quantum  theory,  as  such  an  approach  means  apparent  neglect  of  those 
physical  processes  which,  proceeding  constantly,  are  responsible  for  inseparable  coupling  of  real   
physical  system  to  surrounding  medium.  Introducing  artificial  notion  about  switching  on  and 
switching  out  of  interaction  of  oscillator  with  radiation  field,  we  are  able  to  calculate  within  the 
framework  of  existing  theory  the  width  of  energy  levels  of  oscillator,  but  we  cannot  assert  with 
certainty that such an approach results in correct description of interaction. 
 
From the reasoning given above it is seen that it is the models with energy levels of non-zero 
width that should form the basis for the description of interaction of radiation with substance. It is 
necessary to formulate such a quantum theory which would take into account the energy levels of 
non-zero width  Γ . The case in point is that one should introduce an infinitesimal damping  Γ  into 
the  initial  set  of  equations  describing  interaction  of  charged  particles  with  electromagnetic  field. 
Such an approach means the violation in infinitesimal of homogeneity of physical system relative to 
translations  in  time.  Necessity  of violating  the homogeneity  of  time follows from that fact that in 
)  the  states  of  the  system  of  interacting  fields  have  degeneracy  of 
the  usual  approach  (with 
infinitely  large  multiplicity  in  relation  to  time  translations.  According  to  the  fundamental 
Bogoliubov's concept of quasi-averages [29], when describing the behaviour of degenerate systems, 
one  should  include  into  Hamiltonian  an  infinitesimal  term  removing  degeneracy.  In  the  theory 
presented  here  degeneracy of  states of  quantized  fields  relative translations  in time is removed by 
introducing  the  infinitesimal  damping  Γ   into  Lagrangian.  Thereby  the  degeneracy  under  study  is 
removed  already  in  the  initial,  zero-order  approximation,  which  is  of  fundamental  importance  for 
the approach based on perturbation theory. 
 
Formulation of the physical idea that quantum friction arises at the very elementary level - at 
the level of one particle is given in monograph [26]. Impossibility to isolate real particle from the 
surrounding  world  is  that  property  which  should be taken into  account already in the  one-particle 
theory  (for  each  kind  of  particles),  even  before  switching  on  the  interaction  with  other  particles.    
) is attractive owing to the fact that from the very 
Model of the particle as an open system (
beginning the degeneracy of states relative to time translations is absent in it, the degeneracy, which 
is removed in standard approach by taking into account the interaction of particle with vacuum field 
fluctuations and classical fields. The basis for the developed formulation is the fundamental concept 
of  quasi-averages  supplemented  with  the  requirement  that  the  equations  of  motion  of  the  particle 
 follow from the action principle. It should be emphasized that the non-zero damping  Γ

is introduced into electrodynamics with the aim to establish the structure of the Lagrangian function 
which  takes  into  account  the  property  of  openness  of  physical  system.  After  establishing  the 
structure, the limiting transition 
 
In our opinion, the development of quantum theory will be inevitably connected with the use 
of  models  of  open  system,  as  such  models  reflect  more  completely  the  physical  essence  of 
interrelations in the real world. It is necessary, thus, to define more exactly the concept of openness 
of physical system, which, on the one hand, would describe real system accurately enough and, on 
the other, would be simple enough to describe the particular physical processes. 
 
As open  system has  the richer physical contents in comparison with isolated system, some 
essentially  new  mathematical  ideas  are  needed  for  its  description.  First  of  all,  it  is  necessary  to 
increase the number of independent dynamical variables describing the particle as open system. In 
papers [9,19-24],  as a basis for the description of self-acting electron, the simplest model of open 
system  is  used  which  can  be  described  by  the  Morse-Feshbach-Bateman  Lagrangian  function 
[30,31]  and  which  was  successfully  used  for  the  description  of  dispersive  media  (the  review  of 
articles, in which applications of the model of open system to electrodynamics of dispersive media 
are  considered,  is  given  in  monograph  [26]).  In  this  model  the  number  of  dynamical  variables  is 
doubled  as  compared  with  the  isolated  system,  namely,  to  each  dynamical  variable  of  “bare” 
~Ψ .  These

Note that electromagnetic field, as well as electron field,  should be considered on the basis 
of  the  model  of  open  system.  In  the  simplest  variant  of  the  theory,  each  dynamical  variable  of  
electromagnetic field should be split into two independent components, one of which describes an 
electromagnetic wave, and the other – the environment, in which the wave is propagated and with 
which  it  interacts.  Such  an  approach  is  stated  in  [9].  For  simplicity,  in  the  above  are  given  the 
formulas  relating  to  the  case  that  electromagnetic  field  is  described  in  the  usual  way,  without 
doubling the dynamical variables. 
 Equation  (16)  describes  one  self-acting  particle  interacting  with  vortex  electromagnetic 
 
field.  Generalization  of  this  equation  to  the  set  of  arbitrary  number  n   of  self-acting  electrically 
charged particles interacting with each other is given in [9]. 

Equation (16) coincides in its appearance with the usual Dirac equation for charged particle 
in  an  external  field  described  by  4-potential  A .  However,  in  reality,  it  differs  essentially  from 
Dirac’s equation. The distinction consists in that equation (16) is non-linear and non-local, with 
the  non-locality  being  of  both  spatial  and  time  character.  Potential  (
⊥A ) 
components  of  the  4-potential,  entering  equation  (16),  differ  from  each  other  by  their  physical 
nature: the former describes the Coulomb field and is expressed quadratically in terms of the wave 
function  components  of  electron,  and  the  latter  describes  transverse  electromagnetic waves  and is 
expressed in terms of vortex electromagnetic field.  As  a  detailed  analysis  shows,  solutions  to  the 
basic  dynamical  equation  describe  the  clots  of  self-acting  electrically  charged  matter,  localized  in 
space, i.e. the particle is a soliton.  

||A )  and  vortex  (

The  internal  energy  spectrum  of  electron  is  discrete  with  an  indefinitely  large  number  of 
kE  ( k  is the set of quantum numbers) there correspond 
levels, and to each value of internal energy 
certain  linear  dimensions  and  geometrical  form  of  the  region  of  localization  of  electron’s  charge.  
Dimensions  and  the  number  of  extrema  of  wave  function  increase  with  increasing  the  value  of 
kE .  The distribution of electric charge of atomic electron in the ground state consists of the 
energy 
range of basic localization with the linear dimensions of the order of Bohr radius 
 
)
and of the tail stretching up to infinity. It is essential that because of non-linearity of the dynamical 
equation  of  electron,  wave  function  does  not  obey  the  superposition  principle.  By  virtue  of  this, 
electron  acquires  the  properties  of  absolutely  rigid  body:  the  perturbation acting  on electron at an 
 at any 
instant of time   t  in the range of basic localization becomes known at the next instant  
distance from the particle.

According  to  [9,19],  the  atom  represents  a  system  of  nuclear  and  electronic  solitons 
interacting  with  each  other,  the  internal  energy  spectrum  of  the  hydrogen  atom,  due  to 
electromagnetic  interaction,  being  of  a  zoned  character.  The  occurrence  of  zoned  structure  of 
energy  spectrum  of  hydrogen  atom  is  explained  as  follows.  Free  nucleus,  because  of  existence  of 
Coulomb  self-action,  has  a  discrete  internal  energy  spectrum.  As  the  interaction  of  nucleus  with 
electron  is  small  in  comparison  with  the  energy  of  Coulomb  self-action  of  the  nucleus,  it  can  be 
taken  into  account  by  perturbation  theory.  From  here  it  follows  at  once  that  each  energy  level  of 
free nucleus is split in a zone. There are indefinitely many zones (Balmer’s replicas) and in each of 
them  there  are  indefinitely  many  energy  levels.  The  lowest  zone  coincides  with  the  usual  Balmer 
spectrum.

Physical mechanism of nuclear reactions at low energies  

 

 The  quantum  theory  presented  above  schematically  of  electron  as  an  open self-organizing 
system  is  indicative  of  the  existence  of  the  following  mechanism  of  nuclear  reactions  at  low 
energies [8].  

If  there  occur  in  the  region  of  basic  localization of free electron, whose linear sizes in the 
ground state of the particle are several times as large as those for hydrogen atom (see Fig. 1), two or 
the greater number of nuclei, each of them attracts on itself the adjoining areas of electronic cloud,  
resulting in compression of the electronic cloud as a whole. As a result, there appears automatically  
an attraction of the nuclei, which proved to be “inside” electron, on each other (see Fig. 2).

Calculation shows that the Coulomb barrier around nuclei is deformed, its height decreases 
and the probability of penetration through the barrier accordingly increases due to tunnel transition. 
Under  certain  conditions  this  process  may  result  in  fusion  of  nuclei.  Obviously,  the  process  in 
question can occur only at small energies of translational motion of the centers of mass of electron 
and nuclei: nuclei should be “inside” electron long enough for them to have time to come nearer to 
each  other  as  a  result  of  electron-nuclear  interaction.  This  mechanism  of  nuclear  fusion  is  of  a 
universal  character.  In  order  for  it  to  be  realized,  it  is  necessary  to  have  only  a  stream  of  free 
electrons  intensive  enough,  i.e.  heavy  electric current, and as long as sufficiently great number of 
free nuclei.  

If  heavy  nuclei appear  “inside”  free  electron, owing  to their interaction with the  electronic 
cloud there occurs polarization of nuclei. Because the own field of electron interacts with protons 
more  strongly  than  with  neutrons,  nuclei  are  deformed  (become  extended),  and  this  process  may 
result in the decomposition of nuclei to fragments (in nuclear fission). 

As is noted in [7], the official version of the reasons for Chernobyl accident contains serious 
contradictions, a number of facts concerning the accident has no convincing explanations, and this 
circumstance forces to search for the true reasons for the happening, since “not having understood 
the  mechanism  of  the  one  tragedy,  we  sooner  or  later  shall  become  witnesses  of  the  other”.  The 
authors  hypothesize  that  the  reason  of  the  accident  was  penetration  into  the  nuclear  reactor  of 
magnetic  monopoles,  which  have  caused  the  decay  of  nuclei  238U,  and  this  has  resulted  in 
production  of  delayed  neutrons,  growth  of  power  output  of  the  reactor  and  explosion.  As  an 
argument in favour of the assumption, the fact is presented that nuclei 238U are disintegrated under 
the action of “strange” radiation appearing at explosion of foil.  

In  the  opinion  of  the  authors  of  [5,7],  “strange”  radiation  is  created  by  those  magnetic 
monopoles  which  form  bound  states  with  nuclei  of  atoms.  These  compound  particles  give  the 
abnormally wide tracks similar to those of a creeping caterpillar, and also the tracks of complicated 
shape  reminiscent  of  spirals  and  gratings.  Character  of  tracks  changes  when  imposing  magnetic 
field,  which,  as  the  authors  believe,  is  an  argument  in  favour  of  the  assumption  above.  There are 

 

12 

also some special tracks very similar to scratches and ink spots. “Strange” radiation is of spherical 
form,  it  resembles  a  ball  lightning,  and  its  duration  is  more  than  ten  times  as  great  as  that  of  the 
current pulse arising at electric discharge. With the course of time the luminous sphere (the ball-like 
plasma formation) is dividing into many small “balls”.  

It is our opinion that “strange” radiation is caused by free electrons in excited state arising in 
the area of electric discharge. According to [9, 19], linear sizes of the region of basic localization of 
such electrons can make many tens of sizes of atom. The heavy nucleus, for example, the nucleus 
238U, appearing inside the electronic cloud, is inevitably deformed because of interaction of protons 
with  adjoining  layers  in  the  distribution  of  electric  charge  of  electron,  and  this  deformation  can 
cause  nuclear  fission.  If  two  or  the  greater  number  of  light  nuclei  appear  “inside”  electron,  then 
attractive forces arise between nuclei which may result in fusion reaction. When electric discharge 
is  strong  enough,  the  areas  of  basic  localization  of  some  electrons  can  overlap,  and  if  a  nucleus 
lands  in  the  area  of  overlap,  because  of  Coulomb  attraction  of  nucleus  on  the  adjoining  layers  of 
electronic clouds, a bound state may be formed, of two electrons and the nucleus, characterized by 
the relative stability and significant spatial extension.  

Obviously, if the concentration of free electrons is great enough, there may be formed some 
relatively stable bunch of plasma consisting of great number of free electrons and nuclei, which in 
virtue of chaotic movement of nuclei and because of the absence of preferred directions should have 
approximately  spherical  form.  Note  that  to  “strange”  radiation  can  contribute  atomic  electrons, 
belonging to additional energy zones of atom (Balmer’s replicas associated with nuclear self-action, 
see Section 2). 

As  is  seen  from  the  above,  to  account  for  the  reasons  for  Chernobyl  accident,  there  is  no 
need  to  involve  magnetic  monopoles.  The  scenario of  development of events during the accident, 
described in [7], seems to be quite plausible if only to understand by initiators of nuclear fission not 
hypothetical monopoles but free electrons, whose powerful pulse might arise as a result of electric 
discharge in the region of turbo-generators.  

The existence of simple physical mechanism of nuclear reactions at low energies, indicated 
in this paper, implies that nuclear reactors are, in effect, nuclear delayed-action bombs which will 
blow  up  from  time  to  time.  Explosion  of  nuclear  reactor  may  take  place  because  of  casual  short 
circuit at an electric subcircuit, owing to which there appears an intensive stream of free electrons. 
This stream, having got for any reasons in nuclear reactor, may initiate explosion of the reactor. It 
follows  from  here  that  though  nuclear  stations  may  provide  mankind  with  cheep  energy,  atomic 
energetics  represents  a  very  dangerous  way  of  producing  energy  (as  well  as  the  energetics  using 
controlled  thermonuclear  fusion).  The  only  acceptable  way  of  resolving  the  energetic  problem 
consists in the use of nuclear reactions at low energies. 

According  to  the  results  obtained,  nuclear  reactions  at  low  temperatures  occur  “inside” 
electron under the action of own field of particle. Hence, to elucidate physical mechanism of CF, it 
is  necessary  to  study  in  detail  intra-electronic  processes  and  physical  properties  of  own  fields  of 
particles.  Note  that  the  own  field,  by  its  physical  properties,  essentially  differs  from  the  field  of 
electromagnetic  waves:  this  is  the  field  of  standing  waves  of  matter,  it  is  of  purely  classical 
character and may not be reduced to the set of photons. The own field of charged particle plays in 
nature  a  special  role,  consisting  in  that  it  transforms  environmental  space  into  the  physical 
environment (physical vacuum) with the properties of absolutely rigid body [32]. 

As it was repeatedly noted in the literature [1,2], experiments on CF are badly reproduced, 
and  this  fact  gives  rise  to  doubt  the  very  existence  of  the  phenomenon.  Bad  reproducibility  of 
results seems to be explained by the fact that CF depends upon great number of parameters: upon 
electric current density, concentration of free nucleus, concentration of impurities and dislocations 
in samples, sizes of samples etc. In order to obtain reproducibility of results, it is necessary that all 
these  parameters,  describing  the  environment  in  which  nuclear  reactions  occur,  be  the  same  in 
various experiments, but to achieve this is a difficult task.  
 

 

13 

In conclusion we shall dwell upon the problem of linear dimensions of electron, which is of 
 
special interest in connection with the mechanism of nuclear reactions indicated here. The inference 
that the dimensions of electron in the ground state of atom are of the order of Bohr radius, i.e. of the 
order  of  atomic  dimensions,  following  from  dimension  considerations  [9,19]  and  confirmed  by 
quantum model of electron, seems completely unexpected. At first sight, it is in conflict with both 
the theory of quarks and experimental data on scattering of electrons. According to quark models, 
the radius of electron corresponding to its quark structure makes up the quantity of the order of 10-22 
m  [33].  It  is  necessary  to  emphasize,  however,  that  the  above  mentioned  magnitude  of  linear 
dimensions of electron refers to the internal structure induced by Coulomb field. The last is long-
distance  and  consequently  the  linear  dimensions  of  internal  structures  produced  by  it  (i.e.  spatial 
inhomogeneities  in  the  distribution  of  electric  charge  in  various  quantum  states)  should 
considerably  exceed  the  dimensions  of  quark  structures  connected  with  electron.  There  seems  to 
exist a hierarchy of internal structures of particle produced by Coulomb forces, nuclear forces, inter-
quark interactions etc. characterized by the smaller and smaller linear sizes. 

As to the experiments on scattering of high energy electrons, according to which the internal 
structure  of  electron  is  not  manifested  up  to  distances  of  the  order  of  10-16    ÷   10-17  m,  two 
arguments, at least, can be adduced in favour of that there is no contradiction here with experiment. 
Firstly,  in  experiments  on  scattering,  investigators  were  trying  to  register  the  details  of  internal 
structure  of  electron  within  intervals  much  smaller  than  Bohr  radius,  which  is  why  it  is  not 
surprising that results of experiments proved to be negative: at high energies electrons behave like 
point  particles,  their  internal  structure  has  no  time  to  be  manifested.  Secondly,  the  results  of 
experiments were analyzed from the point of view of standard representations about electron, which 
refer to a point particle, but are obviously inapplicable to real, self-acting electron. According to the 
predictions  of  quantum  theory  of  electron  as  an  open  self-organizing  system,  real  electron  is  a 
special object - soliton, i.e. such a cloud of electrically charged substance which, when interacting 
with  other  particles,  tends  to  keep  its  sizes  and  geometrical  form.  At  present  there  is  as  yet  no 
scattering theory of this kind of particles and for this reason it is impossible to predict with certainty 
how can the internal structure of electron be manifested in experiments on scattering.

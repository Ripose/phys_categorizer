ABSTRACT

      The  conceptual  design  of  a  Variable-Phase  Asynchronous  Cyclotron  (VPAC)  is  describe,  which
provides  longitudinal  bunch  compression  of  accelerated  proton  or  ion  beams,  and  thus,  permits  high
current acceleration at higher accelerator efficiency, where the possible beam losses are minimized and
the  accelerator's  mechanical  tolerances  are  relaxed.    Beam  control  is  assured  by  the  ability  to
independently  set  and  vary  the  acceleration  phase  and  rf  voltage  amplitude,  the  inter-cavity  harmonic
number and the transverse focusing strength, which considerably overcome the space charge effects in
each sector and turn of the proposed cyclotron.  The new accelerator concept is especially suitable to
accelerate intense proton beams up to 800 MeV in energy and average beam current in the 100-mA
class.    All  accelerator  elements  are  based  on  currently  available  and  feasible  technologies.    To
demonstrate feasibility of design, the detailed calculations and modeling of a 10-turn VPAC prototype
for the production of 25.6 MeV, 100 mA proton beam are presented and the key features of the new
accelerator concept are discussed.

      The  Variable-Phase  Asynchronous  Cyclotron  (VPAC)  is  similar  to  the  operation  of  a  rf  linear
accelerator wrapped into a spiral, in which the equilibrium phase of acceleration  je ,  the  acceleration
voltage amplitude in consecutive cavities  U n  and the beam path length between cavities  S n , can vary
individually,  independent  from  each  other.    These  conditions  physically  cannot  be  created  in  classical
ring Isochronous Cyclotrons (IC) [1] or conventional Separate Orbit Cyclotrons (SOC) [2,3,4].  This
is  because  in  such  cyclotrons,  common  sector  cavities  span  the  radial  extent  of  turns,  with  multi-turn
channel  gaps,  in  which  je ,  U n  and  S n   must  be  kept  fixed  to  satisfy  the  isochronism  condition.
However, variable mode operations in  je ,  U n and  S n  can be created in a modification of the separate
orbit  Asynchronous  Cyclotron  (AC)  concept  [5,6],  namely,  in  the  VPAC  approach,  which  is  now
presented and elaborated.  Here, the term asynchronous is used to mean the non-isochronous operation
in cyclotron geometry.
   The  concept  of  AC  is  best  described  as  a  modification  of  the  operating  parameters  of  a  SOC,
having the same external structure, as seen in Figure 1.  If both, the turn radius  Rn  and the acceleration
voltage frequency  f  in a SOC are selected to be large, such that  q , the inter-cavity harmonic number,
is a large integer at injection:

                                            q

where  N c   is  the  number  of  cavities  in  a  cyclotron  stage  and  bnc  is the speed of particles, then  q
would decrease continually in the course of  acceleration, as the speed of particles increased from turn
to turn.
   Instead of the synchronous condition for all orbits in an  isochronous  cyclotron,  which  requires  the
b  to be a constant integer (constant rotation period for

all turns), in an AC, the inter-cavity harmonic number  q
 is also required to be an integer, but
may change in discrete steps in the acceleration process.  The reduced harmonic number  q   needs  to
remain  at  a  specific  constant  value  only  between  consecutive  acceleration  gaps.    In  an  asynchronous
cyclotron, hopping over discrete integer values of  q significantly changes the bunch revolution frequency
in each turn, which is accomplished by appropriately designing and changing the magnetic path length in
each sector.  Thus, by necessity, the asynchronous cyclotron concept can be applied only in separate-
orbit cyclotrons.
      As  initially  discussed  [5,6],  the  asynchronous  cyclotron  concept  included  the  following  first  four
features.
   First, this scheme permits to limit the growth of orbit separations between the injection radius  Rinj  and
the radius at extraction  Rext , while allowing the average radius  Rave  of the cyclotron to be sufficiently
large.
      Second,  the  turn-to-turn  separation  for  all  orbits  can  now  be  designed  to  have  a  nearly  equal  and
suitably  large  value,  to  provide  for  the  use  of  a  large  radial  aperture  vacuum  chamber,  for  the
acceleration of high current beams at small losses.
   Third, in a large  Rave   AC, sector magnets have much reduced field strengths, removing the necessity
to use superconducting magnets.

2

   Fourth, the length of straight sections between sector magnets is increased, to contain much stronger
transverse focusing elements.
   In this paper additional innovations are made to increase the utility and advantage of asynchronous
cyclotrons,  for  which  the  new  accelerator  concept  is  named  the  Variable-Phase  Asynchronous
Cyclotron—VPAC, according to the following next five features.
   Fifth, the bunch acceleration equilibrium phase  je   can  be  varied  over  a  wide  range,  individually  in
each sector, by also modifying the beam path length between adjacent cavities  S n .
      Sixth,  the  acceleration  voltage  amplitude  U n   in  each  sector  can  be  varied  independently,  by
mechanical [2] and electrical means introduced in cavity channels, which will be described in a separate
publication.
   Seventh, consequently, longitudinal bunch compression can now be programmed in each sector, by
suitably selecting  je  and  U n  values.  This feature increases the acceleration efficiency, reduces beam
losses due to increasing longitudinal bunch size as it occurs in isochronous cyclotrons.
      Eighth,  the  ability  to  independently  vary  the  transverse  focusing  strength  in  all  sectors  and  turns
D Q   and  avoids  the
compensates  the  space  charge  dependent,  betatron  oscillation  tune  shift, 
resonances.
   Ninth, the ability to independently vary and set the basic parameters of  je ,  U n ,  D Q ,  relaxes  the
required mechanical tolerances in all sectors of the cyclotron.
   The principle of operation of such an accelerator consists of the following (see also Figure 1).
   We note that in injected beams and those from strongly focused magnetic lines, usually particles at the
head of a bunch come with higher energy than particles at the center; and those at the tail of the bunch
have the lower energy.
   As this type of injected beam enters the cyclotron, at the first acceleration gap of the first cavity, the
equilibrium phase je1  for the acceleration of bunches is selected with the help of the rf generator setting.
Also, the acceleration voltage amplitude U 1 is set, based on the beam parameters, the follow-on beam
path length  S1,  the  momentum  compaction  factor  and  the  other  features  in  the  first  sector  of  the
cyclotron’s first turn.
   The selection of  je1
 and  U 1  is  made  such  that  upon  exiting  from  the  first  cavity,  the  particle
distribution in bunches would be reversed—particles with higher energy would now appear in the tail of
bunches instead of being initially at the head.  The strength of this reversal must be such that the fast
particles in the tail, just prior to entering the second cavity after a path length  S1, would catch up with or
overtake the slow particles in the head of the bunches.  This produces the desired longitudinal bunch
compression at the second sector.  Similar procedures are used in successive sectors and turns.
   We also note that all sectors are essentially non-isochronous (asynchronous) transport lines, in which
phase-space rotation of the longitudinal emittance ellipse is occurring [7].  The value of the equilibrium
phase  in  subsequent  acceleration  gaps,  on  the  average,  will  be  increased  gradually,  approaching  the
wave crest at 0 degree, except for the small phase decreases to compensate for the expansion of the
bunches.  The above makes it possible to effectively increase the acceleration efficiency and accordingly
to reduce the number of beam turns.
   Bunch processes take place in six-dimensional phase space, under the validity of  Liouville’s theorem,
and beam parametric changes can be estimated as solutions of Vlasov’s equation [7].  As a result of the
forced variation of the bunch length, it is now possible to have a reduction of the longitudinal emittance,
coupled  with  increasing  the  transverse  emittances,  while  the  six-dimensional  phase  space  density  is
preserved.    The  resulting  increase  in  the  horizontal  emittance  will  be  more  than  the  increase  in  the

3

vertical  emittance,  as  will  be  shown  in  the  detailed  numerical  calculations  and  modeling  of  the  25.6-
MeV prototype accelerator.
   The above considerations indicate that for such an accelerator it will also be necessary to have large
turn-to-turn separations, typically in the range of 24 – 34 cm, to accommodate for the acceleration of
100-mA class beams.  The vacuum chamber of the separated orbits would have a vertical aperture of 5
– 7 cm and a horizontal aperture of 10 – 14 cm, provided that a small-emittance modern injector, such
as the radio frequency  quadrupole (RFQ) linac [8] is used.  Modern computer-code calculations with
ability  to  handle  the  bunch  space  charge  in  three  dimensions,  such  as  the  Los  Alamos  National
Laboratory’s  Trace-3D  Beam  Dynamics  Program  [9]  is  employed  in  this  paper,  to  demonstrate
feasibility of this accelerator’s conceptual design approaches.
   At lower energies of protons or ions rapid changes in  b  take  place,  to  be  able  to  manipulate  the
hopping of inter-cavity harmonic number  q  over integer values.  Since it is also desirable to maintain the
accelerator  radius  of  a  cyclotron  stage  at  a  reasonable  value,  it  appears  from  Equation  (1)  that  the
VPAC accelerator scheme can be applied for proton energies of up to 800  MeV, for the acceleration
of 100-mA class beams, in a few successive stages.  All accelerator elements are based on currently
available and feasible technologies.  Similarly, this concept can act as a powerful injector, in the size
given  in  the  prototype’s  numerical  example,  to  inject  into  other  types  of  higher  energy  proton  or  ion
accelerators.

CONDITIONS FOR BUNCH COMPRESSION IN THE VPAC

   The creation of bunch compression in this accelerator scheme is inherently made possible by (a) the
available independent setting of the rf acceleration equilibrium phase  je , in each acceleration gap, and
(b)  the  available  independent  setting  of  the  acceleration  voltage  amplitude  U n ,  in  any  n-th  sector
acceleration channel.    In this case, the continuous differential equation for synchrotron oscillations does
not  apply.    Consequently,  at  start  up,  je   in  each  cavity  gap  is  determined  by  the  following
considerations.
   Upon exiting an  rf acceleration gap, the energy gain of an extreme particle  a at the head of a bunch
D E a , the energy gain of an extreme particle  b at the tail of a bunch  D Eb ,  and  the  energy  gain  of  the
equilibrium particle in a bunch  D E e  are obtained by

value if the acceleration gap is increased in proportion to the speed of the accelerated beam, which in
turn  increases  the  amplitude  of  the  acceleration  voltage  U n ,  for  the  same  electric  field  in  the  sector
cavities, to achieve a specified energy gain.
   If  E e  is the energy of the synchronous particle as the bunch enters a cavity gap and  D E s  is the half
width of the energy spread in the bunch, then upon exiting the cavity, the energy of the extreme particles

such that the phase of off-center particles always remains on the rising side and below the crest of the rf
wave, to maintain a Gaussian bunch distribution.

bunch compression with a corresponding decrease in the value of  t f  is described.
      The  last  case  is  possible  only  when  a  head-to-tail  particle  reversal  configuration  is  obtained.    In
addition to the independent setting of  je  and U n  in each sector, use of the particle head-to-tail reversal
configuration is the third condition to support the axial compression of bunches in this accelerator.
   In Equation (8), a negative sign for  t f   signifies  the  over-compression  of  bunches,  after  which,  a
normal distribution of particles is restored with the higher energy particles appearing at the head.
   If  conditions  are  found  by  the  proper  selection  of  je   to  always  support  the  reverse-particle
distribution, t f  will continually decrease.  From Equation (9) it is evident, to obtain large and negative
values of  D t , it is also necessary to have large sector path lengths  S n  and large negative differences in
the reciprocals of  b.  These are the fourth and fifth conditions to achieve axial bunch compression in
this accelerator.

   The values of beam injection energy  E inj , the transverse and longitudinal  emittances at injection, the
initial  bunch  duration  ts i, ,  the  injection  radius  Rinj ,  the  number  of  acceleration  cavities  N c ,  the
maximum amplitude of acceleration voltage  U n , and the  rf frequency  f ,  are  normally  chosen  on  the
basis of available and feasible technologies.  Having selected these parameters beforehand, and based
on the simultaneous solution of Equations (3) – (9), the required value of the acceleration equilibrium
phase  je   is  determined,  such  that  bunch  compression  in  a  given  sector  is  achieved.    The  analytical
solution  of  these  coupled  equations  is  sufficiently  cumbersome  to  reproduce  here.    A  computer-code
calculation  provides  the  optimized  values  of  the  above  parameters,  which  are  then  inserted  into  the
Trace-3D [9] computations for the modeling of each sector.
   In this accelerator concept, the following is the control algorithm for the steering of bunches from one
sector to the next.  As a function of the injected beam’s measured energy spread  D E s i, , the duration of
bunches  t f
i, ,  the  design  value  of  the  beam  path  length  in  the  first  sector  S1,  and  the  selected  rf
acceleration voltage in the first resonator U 1, the rf phase is set at the generator.  This is done such that
an equilibrium phase  je   is  produced  on  the  rising  side  of  the  acceleration  voltage,  which  after  the
passage of a bunch in the first rf gap, will cause at once the inversion of particles.
   That inversion should be of sufficient strength to reduce the duration of bunches  t f 1  to a small value,
at  the  end  of  the  beam  path  in  the  first  sector.    Thus,  there  are  two  cases  to  consider;  one,  which
conserves  the  inverted  distribution  and  the  other,  which  induces  inversion  and  over-compression  and
then restores back to the normal distribution of particles in a bunch.
   In the first case, when it is necessary to obtain a monoenergetic beam, the equilibrium phase in the last
resonator channel is set, such that the acceleration takes place on the falling side of the  rf field.  In this
case  D E s  in Equation (6) takes on a negative sign, setting  E
.  This condition is desirable when
the beam is just being extracted from the accelerator.  In the second case, instead, the rising side of the
rf  voltage  is  used  to  obtain  bunches  of  small  duration.    For  the  most  desired  case  of  preserving  the
inverted  distribution  of  particles,  it  is  necessary  to  work  only  on  the  rising  side  of  the  rf  acceleration
field.
   The path length of particles in sectors is set by the parameters of the bending magnetic system, which
essentially must change from sector to sector, to provide the desired values of both  q  and je .  To have
the possibility of precise tuning and to relax the maintenance of mechanical tolerances of the accelerator
components  and  their  alignment,  different  correction  elements  will  be  placed  in  the  straight  section  of
each sector.  This is in addition to the quadrupole lenses for the strong transverse focusing of the beam
and a number of beam-monitoring elements.  In particular, wiggler type chicane magnets will be installed
in the straight sections to adjust the path length of particles at the required values.  Finally, it is estimated
that  by  having  large  turn-to-turn  separation  and  the  other  features  of  the  VPAC,  the  mechanical
tolerances of accelerator elements and their alignment are relatively relaxed by an order of magnitude
and need be only in the order of 10-3.
      The  important  relaxation  of  tolerances  in  this  accelerator  concept  is  one  of  its  main  advantages,  in
comparison to other similar accelerator structures, such as the isochronous separate orbit cyclotrons [2
–  4].    In  the  latter,  the  necessity  of  strictly  maintaining  the  isochronism  of  particle  motion  reduces  to
having tight tolerances, which in practice are difficult to implement.  Other important advantages are due
to  the  features  of  longitudinal  bunch  compression  and  strong  transverse  focusing.    These  make  it
possible  to  accelerate  bunches  at  an  equilibrium  phase  close  to  the  wave  crest  at  0  degree,  which  in
turn, increases the efficiency of acceleration, decreases the number of turns, decreases the beam losses,
and increases the number of accelerated particles in bunches.

      Basically,  this  accelerator  concept’s  deficiency  is  the  uniqueness  or  unprecedented  nature  of  the
sector bending magnetic system.  This complicates the standardization of their manufacture and tuning.
However,  some  technical  innovations  already  made,  facilitate  the  solution  of  these  problems.    This
concerns the fabrication of magnet yokes from iron sheets with the ability of mechanically changing the
magnetic lengths and the remote control of the magnetic alignment in each sector and turn.  Also, the
variety of magnetic path lengths required in the sectors of each turn can be accommodated by the use of
several short standard dipole modules of a few types, which are appropriately arranged.  The individual
supply  and  control  of  the  sector  bending  magnets  and  the  quadrupole  focusing  lenses  using  modern
electronics and computers is straightforward to implement.
   The strong beam transverse focusing elements in the straight section of each sector are of the type
normally found in strong focusing synchrotrons.  In particular, the separate function periodic magnetic
structure  can  be  of  the  FODO  type.    In  this  accelerator  concept  the  main  difference  will  be  the
possibility of having a slowly varying betatron oscillation frequency, in going from one focusing period to
another.  This will compensate the frequency shift of the betatron oscillations, due to space charge and
other effects.

RESULTS OF NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS AND MODELING

      Numerical  calculations  and  modeling  based  on  the  Trace-3D  [9]  and  other  computer  codes  are
performed for a prototype VPAC accelerator.  This is done to show the feasibility of conceptual design
approaches  and  to  identify  the  accelerator’s  main  components,  employing  the  available  and  feasible
technologies.  A 100 mA average current proton beam from a 2.0-MeV RFQ  linac is injected into the
designed accelerator structure, in which four rf acceleration cavities operate at 50 MHz.  The operating
frequency  of  the  RFQ  injector  could  be  higher  (i.e.  350  MHz),  for  which  a  bunch  manipulation  rf
scheme is used to convert the frequency of the injected bunch train to 50 MHz, which will be described
in  a  separate  publication.    For  the  injected  beam,  a  longitudinal  emittance  of  1.0p   degree-MeV  is
assumed and a high transverse emittance of 25.0p  mm-mrad is taken.
      The  drawing  in  Figure  1  shows  the  first  three  turns  beam  orbits  of  the  asynchronous  prototype
cyclotron,  in  which  a  proton  beam  is  accelerated  from  2  MeV  to  25.6  MeV  in  10  turns.    The
accelerator has Nc = 4 cavities, each with 10 beam channels, and 8 sectors per turn (a total of n = 80
sectors and 40 independently tuned inter-cavity sections).  Beams are injected at a radius of  Rinj  = 2.5
m and extracted at  Rext  = 5.5 m, where the turn-to-turn separation is in the range of 0.24 – 0.34 m.
   The prototype accelerator’s conceptual design is also based on the use of modern room- temperature
rf acceleration cavities similar to those developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute [10] and elsewhere [10],
for operation in the range of 40 – 50 MHz.  These would have a length of 6.0-m, height of 3.0 m and
width of 0.3 m and sustain a peak voltage of 1.1 MV.  The radial extent of the useful beam channel for
the 10 turns would be 4.0 m long.
   Key parameters of the Variable-Phase AC prototype accelerator are given in Table 1.  Similarly, the
geometrical layout of the acceleration gaps, the sector bending magnets and quadrupole focusing lenses
and drift sections are shown in Figures 3 – 4, only for the first and tenth turns.  However, all 10 turns
were calculated and modeled.  In these Figures, Trace-3D numerical calculation results are shown for
the  key  beam  dynamical  parameters,  including  changes  in  the  transverse-longitudinal  emittances,  the
beam envelopes, the bunch length and the actual size of the beam in three dimensions.
   Comparing the beam envelopes in Figures 3 – 4, it is seen that the accelerated beam is well confined,
within the design’s tolerable limits.  A beam vacuum vessel of 7 cm in height and 14 cm in width for the

7

/

ext

separated  turns  can  easily  be  accommodated  inside  these  magnets,  and  within  the  turn-to-turn
separation of 24 – 34 cm.  This ensures that beam losses will be minimal and within the requirement of
less than 0.1 nA/m.
   The additional advantage of having axial bunch compression in VPAC accelerators is best seen by
comparing the energy spread of the accelerated beam at the end of the first turn and at extraction, in
Figures 3 and 4.  While at the end of the first turn, the energy spread of the beam is 2.75% HWHM,
this is reduced to  D E Es
  =  0.30%  HWHM  at  the  end  of  the  tenth  turn,  when  the  beam  will  be
extracted.
   The variation of important parameters in the course of acceleration from 2.0 to 25.6 MeV is shown in
Figures 2 and 5 – 10.  Figure 2 displays the designed variation of the inter-cavity harmonic number  q ,
over  the  40  sections  in  the  course  of  acceleration  in  the  prototype  VPAC.      Figure  5  shows  the
corresponding  changes  in  the  equilibrium  phase  of  bunches  je .    Figure  6  gives  the  settings  of  the
acceleration voltage amplitude U n .  Figure 7 is the settings of the inter-sector path length  S n .  Figure 8
gives the settings of the sector magnetic path length  Lm .  Figure 9 displays the corresponding settings of
the sector magnetic dipole field strength  Hm .  Figure 10  gives the energy of the equilibrium particle in a
bunch  E e .
   In this accelerator concept, sector magnets have low field strengths, in the range of 0.39 – 0.72 T.
As  the  length  of  the  sector  bending  magnets  varies  from  0.34  m  to  1.0  m  over  the  ten  turns,  smaller
dipole magnetic modules of a few types will be used to assemble sector magnets of different lengths, for
each turn.  The use of small modular optimized magnets will also permit to standardize the fabrication of
all sector magnets, reducing cost and fabrication time. The remaining free straight-section lengths, after
the placement of acceleration cavities and the bending magnets, will be in excess of 2.0 m per sector.
This  is  more  than  sufficient  for  the  placement  of  eight  strong  focusing  quadrupole  lenses  and  beam
diagnostic detectors, and to ensure the 100% extraction of the beam in the last turn.

CONCLUSION

      We  have  shown  that  the  VPAC  accelerator  concept  combines  the  most  desirable  features  of  the
highest-current-producing proton  rf  linear  accelerators  and  the  compact,  efficient  cyclotrons.    The
feasibility  of  the  conceptual  design  approach  has  been  demonstrated  by  the  use  of  three-dimensional
space-charge  numerical  calculations  and  modeling.    The  presented  prototype  25.6-MeV,  100-mA
proton VPAC accelerator has several applications, in stand-alone mode, or as a high-current injector to
other types of proton or ion accelerators, or in extended mode to produce intense proton beams of up
to 800 MeV.  Based on this feasibility study, the next step will be to conduct the detailed design and
construction of the prototype VPAC, as a proof-of-concept demonstration and to advance the several
important applications of this accelerator.

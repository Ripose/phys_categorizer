ABSTRACT 

We  present  the  development  of  a  LabVIEW  multimedia  module  for  introductory  Quantum 

Physics  courses  and  our  experience  in  the  use  of  this  application  as  an  educational  tool  in  learning 

methodologies.  The  program  solves  the  Time  Dependent  Schrödinger  Equation  for  arbitrary 

potentials.  We  describe  the  numerical  method  used  for  solving  this  equation,  as  well  as  some 

mathematical tools employed to reduce the calculation time and to obtain more accurate results. As an 

illustration,  we  present  the  evolution  of  a  wave  packet  for  three  different  potentials:  the  repulsive 

barrier  potential,  the  repulsive  step  potential,  and  the  harmonic  oscillator.  This  application  has  been 

successfully integrated in the learning strategies of the course Quantum Physics for Engineering at the 

Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. 

Keywords: Finite Difference Method, LabVIEW, Schrödinger Equation, Digital Simulation.

1. Introduction. 

Recently Information and Communication Technologies (there after ICTs) have changed the 

conception of the teaching process both in the classroom and in the theoretical teaching approaches. 

Traditional  content-oriented  teaching  approaches  are  being  replaced  by  student-oriented  ones.  In 

agreement  with  the  principles  of  constructivism,  ICTs  benefit  from  permanent  interactivity  [1]. 

Particularly, learning strategies based on digital simulations have demonstrated to provide additional 

advantages  [2,3].  However,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  pedagogical  effectiveness  is  related  to  the 

complete integration of the simulation in the overall instruction plan [4,5]. 

 

The  introduction  of  ICTs  for  teaching  permits  to  present  the  contents  of  the  course  from 

different  points  of  view.  For  example,  computer  simulations  allow  the  development  of  virtual 

experiments in which the students can decide in situ the correct values to obtain and visualize certain 

physical phenomena [6]. In our opinion, this learning strategy is much better for students both in terms 

of  understanding  and  visualizing  than  just  passively  attending  lectures,  because  it  permits  a  closer 

interaction between the students and the contents of the course. 

This learning methodology has been applied in the course Quantum Physics for Engineering at 

the Polytechnic University of Valencia (PUV), Spain, where it was incorporated to the study program 

of the Higher Technical School of Industrial Engineering in 2002. The instruction plan of this course 

includes a wide variety of learning tools, with the purpose of making the learning process easier for 

the  students,  e.g.,  solving  practical  problems  in  the  classroom  with  the  help  of  the  teacher,  playing 

educational  videos  about  physical  phenomena  and  using  digital  simulation  programs,  like  the  one 

reported  here.  All  these  tools  serve  as  complement  to  the  traditional  lectures  where  the  teacher 

explains the theoretical contents of the course with help of the text-book [7].  

 

As  part  of  our  teaching  activities  we  have  developed  interactive  digital  simulation  programs 

that  illustrate  physical  concepts  as  a  complement  to  the  theoretical  explanations.  In  this  paper  we 

present a LabVIEW multimedia application for introductory Quantum Physics courses. LabVIEW is a 

graphical  programming  environment  using  icons  quite  unlike  the  text-based  programming  with 

conventional  languages  such  as  C  or  FORTRAN.  We  can  find  in  the  literature  examples  of 

pedagogical  LabVIEW  applications  for  Physics  and  Engineering  [8,9].  Our  LabVIEW  stand-alone 

executable program solves the Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE) by a finite difference 

technique. Implicit Crank Nicolson scheme is normally employed to solve this equation because of its 

unconditional  stability.  LabVIEW  provides  interesting features  to  develop  Graphical  User  Interfaces 

(GUI) characterized by their friendly appearance so that they are easy to use as well as very attractive 

for the user. With this program we are able to simulate the dynamics of a particle under the effect of 

different potentials. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we revise the solution for the TDSE as well as 

the numerical techniques employed to obtain the solution. In Section 3 we discuss the implementation 

of the finite difference scheme in LabVIEW and present some numerical results of the dynamics of a

wave  packet  at  different  potentials.  We  describe  some  tools  that  reduce  calculation  time.  Finally, 

Section 4 summarizes our main results. 

2. Numerical Formulation. 

The problem to solve corresponds to the one-dimensional dynamics of a quantum particle at a 

given  potential.  Particle  movement  is  described  by  the  Time  Dependent  Schrödinger  Equation  [7] 

given by

where  Ψ(x,t)  is  the  wave  function  of  a  particle  at  position  x  at  time  t,  and  m  is  the  particle  mass. 

dx

 is the probability of locating the particle between the positions x0 and x1 at time t. The 

solution  of  equation  (1)  provides  the  time  evolution  of  the  wavefunction  under  the  influence  of  the 

potential defined by the function V(x). To solve this differential equation we need an initial value for 

the function so as to permit the analysis of its time evolution. Thus, we will be dealing with a problem 

of initial values. The initial gaussian wavefunction takes the usual form

The implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme used to solve Eq. (3) consists of the discretization of the 

continuous spatial and temporal domain where the wavefunction, Ψ(x',t'), is defined. We choose both 

spatial  and  temporal  steps  of  discretization  ∆x’  and  ∆t’  so  that  the  discrete  variables  become  x’j  = 
x’0+j∆x’ and t’n = t’0+n∆t’, where  j and n are integers. The approximation to the solution at time step 
n = Ψ (xj,tn) and the potential at this position is V’j= V’(xj). The finite 
t’n and at spatial step x’j is Ψj

difference operators that approximate the derivatives appearing in the TDSE are

This scheme yields a linear system of equations for each time step with as many equations as 

spatial  steps  to  solve  the  problem.  We  must  solve 

n

jΨ   for  each  value  of  j  and  n.  The  values  of  the 

function at each extreme  of the spatial domain are  given by boundary conditions. Usually the wave 

function  is  zero  at  the  boundary  of  the  spatial  domain  when  the  solution  does  not  arrive  at  the 

boundary  and  the  proper  dynamics  of  the  particle  at  the  particular  potential  can  be  studied  [10].  In 

order to solve the linear system of equations given by Eq. (10), it can be writen in matrix notation as

In  (11)  we  know  the  wavefunction  at  the  time  step  n, 

n

jΨ ,  and  the  solution  of  this  linear 

system  of  equations  provides  the  wavefunction  at  the  next  time  step, 

.  The  Crank  Nicolson 

1+Ψ n

j

scheme is chosen because it is unconditionally stable regardless of the step size used to discretize the 

equation. The finite difference method will be stable although it may not be exact if a big step size is 

chosen. Besides, the square of the absolute value of the function must remain constant throughout the 

calculation process, which is a very important characteristic of the problem we are dealing with.

The initial condition for the wave packet is calculated in a subroutine which is called from the 

main program. This routine is used to generate the initial values of the wave packet for each value of 

the spatial variable. So it is called as many times as spatial steps for a given time step.  

3. Presentation of results. 

We  have  chosen  LabVIEW  in  order  to  implement  the  previous  formulation  for  the  teaching 

purpose.  LabVIEW  is  an  object-oriented  language  for  virtual  instruments  programming.  ICTs  allow 

now  to  simulate  laboratory  tools  by  using  a  personal  computer  so  that  we  don’t  have  to  buy  the 

expensive instruments used in a laboratory for signal analysis, for example. This kind of programs that 

simulate the behaviour of complex devices are called virtual instruments and LabVIEW is one of the 

languages allowing virtual instrument programming. 

Due to its flexibility and capability for doing calculations in an easy manner, LabVIEW is a 

useful programming language to obtain very friendly graphical interfaces, as the one presented here. 

Additionally,  LabVIEW  RunTime  Engine  makes  it  possible  to  obtain  a  stand-alone  application  that 

can be installed in any personal computer which has this module installed. In this way there is no need 

to install the complete LabVIEW environment. It also permits the programmer to choose the controls, 

i.e., the controls are those variables that the user can change from the Control Panel. The indicators 

display  the  user  the  results  of  the  calculations  of  our  program;  they  can  be  distinguished  from  the 

controls because indicators can not be modified by the user. All these reasons justify the selection of 

LabVIEW as a very interesting simulation tool of physical phenomena.  

With  respect  its  programming  language,  an  object-oriented  language  is  much  closer  to 

intuition than any other language. For example, in Fig. 1 we show the code that represents the kernel 

of the finite difference calculation. The upper diagram represents the calculation of the right hand side 

of equation (9). This term correspond to independent vector b in the linear system of equations given 

by  Ax=b.  Observe  that  the  coefficient  matrix  is  tridiagonal.  Then,  we  proceed  to  calculate  the  LU 

decomposition of matrix A to solve the system of equations in a more effective way by forward and 

backward substitution of the two underlying triangular systems of equations given by Ly=b and Ux=y. 

This  is  represented  in  the  lower  diagram  of  figure  1.  The  calculation  makes  the  resolution  of  the 

system of equations (11) much quicker. 

 

The Front Panel of the application is shown in Fig. 2. The user has to determine the properties 

of  the  wave packet  at  t  = 0,  the  characteristics  of  the  potential  to  simulate  and  the  size  of  the  steps 

used to discretize the equation in both variables (temporal and spatial). The wavefunction at t = 0 is a 

gaussian wave packet scaled to one. The initial position of the packet, its central momentum and its 

standard deviation, must be defined by the user. Different values have to be defined for each potential.  

For example,  the user must define the frequency of the harmonic oscillator potential or the position 

and height of the energy barrier when simulating the barrier potential. For the characterization of the 

finite difference method, the user has to define the size of the steps used to discretize the equation are 

required as well as the number of intervals necessary to discetize the two-dimensional domain. It is 

 

 

 

 

5

important to remember that the selection of this parameter i.e., (step size) will determine the accuracy 

of our numerical approximation to the solution. 

 

The  tool  presented  here  has  been  applied  in  the  course  to  study  the  interaction  of  a  wave 

packet  with  arbitrary  potentials.  First,  the  students  can  see  how  the  bound  states  of  each  potential 

evolve with no changes in their shape because they are solutions to the Time Independent Schrodinger 

Equation. The students can also study other additional aspects of the dynamics of a quantum particle 

relative  to  particle  interaction  with  different  potentials.  The  program  permits  to  save  the  data  into  a 

text file in which we can store the evolution of the position and momentum expectation values, as well 

as  the  transmission  and  reflection  coefficients.  Figs.  3,  4,  and  5,  present  the  results  obtained  for 

different potentials. 

•  Repulsive  Barrier  Potential.  As  an  illustration  in  Fig.  3  we  present  three  different  frames 

taken  from  the  simulation  of  the  dynamics  of  a  particle  that  collides  against  a  repulsive 

barrier. We can see the transmission of the wave packet through the barrier. 

•  Repulsive  Step  Potential.  Fig.  4  shows  the  simulation  corresponding  to  a  particle  colliding 

against a repulsive step potential. We can see that the wavefunction is likely to stay inside the 

repulsive  potential  temporarily.  In  fact,  this  phenomenon  should  not  get  confused  with  the 

transmission of the particle, which in fact, does not occur at this potential. 

•  Harmonic  Oscillator.  Fig.  5  shows  the  evolution  of  a  wave  packet  under  the  effect  of  a 

quadratic harmonic oscillator. The wave packet experiences a periodic movement where the 

period depends on the frequency of the harmonic oscillator. 

 

4. Conclusions. 

In  this  paper  we  have  presented  a  new  pedagogical  tool  to  complement  the  teaching  of 

Quantum  Physics  in  the  studies  of  Engineering.  It  is  a  simulation  program  based  on  LabVIEW. 

Students can use the program at any moment of their instruction and as many times as required. The 

use  of  this  tool  in  the  Lab  sessions  helps  to  improve  the  student’s  understanding  of  quantum 

phenomena. From our point of view, this simulation program has two principal advantages over more 

traditional teaching materials: a) the users are able to study the influence of the different variables of 

the  problem  without  having  to  solve  the  entire  problem  every  time,  and  b)  the  visualization  of  the 

process  helps  to  understand  the  quantum  phenomena.  With  respect  to  the  learning  strategies,  the 

program  allows  the  use  of  different  integrated  techniques  that  help  to  reach  a  greater  variety  of 

students. Furthermore, this simulation program exports calculation data so that the students can write a 

short report describing the simulations they have performed explaining the results obtained.

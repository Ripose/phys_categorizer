Abstract
   Theory and computations are provided for building of optimal (minimum weight) solid space towers 
(mast)  up  to  one  hundred  kilometers  in  height.  These  towers  can  be  used  for  tourism;  scientific 
observation  of  space,  observation  of  the  Earth’s  surface,  weather  and  upper  atmosphere experiment, 
and for radio, television, and communication transmissions. These towers can also be used to launch 
spaceships and Earth satellites.
   These  macroprojects  are  not  expensive.  They  require  strong  hard  material  (steel).  Towers  can  be 
built  using  present  technology.    Towers  can  be  used  (for  tourism,  communication,  etc.)  during  the 
construction  process  and  provide  self-financing  for  further  construction.  The  tower  design  does  not 
require human work at high altitudes; the tower is separated into sections; all construction can be done 
at the Earth’s surface.
   The  transport  system  for  a  tower  consists  of  a  small  engine  (used  only  for  friction  compensation) 
located at the Earth’s surface. 
   Problems  involving  security,  control,  repair,  and  stability  of  the  proposed  towers  are  addressed  in 
other cited publications. 
Key words: Space tower, optimal space mast, space tourism, space communication, space launch, space observation

1. Introduction
  1.1. Brief History. The idea of building a tower high above the Earth into the heavens is very old [1]. 
The writings of Moses, in chapter 11 of his book Genesis refers to an early civilization that tried to 
build a tower to heaven out of brick and tar. This construction was called the Tower of Babel, and was 
reported to be located in Babylon in ancient Mesopotamia. Later in chapter 28, Jacob had a dream 
about a staircase or ladder built to heaven. This construction was called Jacob’s Ladder. More 
contemporary writings on the subject date back to K.E. Tsiolkovski in his manuscript “Speculation 
about Earth and Sky and on Vesta,” published in 1895 [2]. This idea inspired Sir Arthur Clarke  to 
write his novel, The Fountains of Paradise [3], about  a space tower (elevator) located on a 
fictionalized Sri Lanka, which brought the concept to the attention of the entire 20th Century world.  
  Today, the world’s tallest construction is a television transmitting tower (mast) near Fargo, North 
Dakota, USA. It stands 629 m high and was built in 1963 for KTHI-TV. The CNN Tower in Toronto, 
Ontario, Canada is the world’s tallest building. It is 553 m in height, was completed in1975, and has 
the world’s highest observation deck at 447 m. The tower structure is concrete up to the observation 
deck level. Above is a steel structure supporting radio, television, and communication antennas. The 
total weight of the tower is 3,000,000 metric tons.
 The Ostankin Tower in Moscow is 540 m in height and has an observation desk at 370 m. The world’s 
tallest office building is the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malasia. The twin towers are 452 m in 
height. They are 10 m taller than the Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The Skyscrapers (Taipei, 
Taiwan, 2004) has height of 509 m, the Eiffel Tower (Paris, 1887-1889) has 300 m, Empire State 
Building (USA, New York, 1930-1931) has 381 m + TV mast of 61 m. Under construction a building 
of 1001 m (Kuwait City, Kuwait) and 1430 m Supported Structure in Gulf of Mexico.  
  Current materials make it possible even today to construct towers many kilometers in height. 
However, conventional towers are very expensive, costing billions of dollars. When considering how 
high a tower can be built, it is important to remember that it can be built to any height if the base is 

2

large enough. Theoretically, you could build a tower to geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) out of 
bubble gum, but the base would likely cover half the surface of the Earth. 
  The proposed optimal masts (towers) are cheaper in lots of hundreds. They can be built on the Earth’s 
surface and their height can be increased as necessary. Their base is not large. The main innovations in 
this project are the application of optimal structures (minimum weight), hydrogen for filling tube
structures at high altitude and a solution of a stability problem for tall (thin) solid columns, and 
utilization of new materials [4]-[7].
  The tower applications. The high towers (3-100 km) have numerous applications for government 
and commercial purposes:
 Entertainment and Observation platform.
 Entertainment and Observation desk for tourists. Tourists could see over a huge area, including the 

darkness of space and the curvature of the Earth’s horizon. 

 Drop tower: tourists could experience several minutes of free-fall time. The drop tower could 

 A permanent observatory on a tall tower would be competitive with airborne and orbital platforms 

provide a facility for experiments.

for Earth and space observations.

 Communication boost: A tower tens of kilometers in height near metropolitan areas could provide 

much higher signal strength than orbital satellites.

 Solar power receivers: Receivers located on tall towers for future space solar power systems would 

permit use of higher frequency, wireless, power transmission systems (e.g. lasers).

 Low Earth Orbit (LEO) communication satellite replacement: Approximately six to ten 100-km-

tall towers could provide the coverage of a LEO satellite constellation with higher power, 
permanence, and easy upgrade capabilities.

 Other new revolutionary methods of access to space are described in [8]-[15].

 2. Description of Innovation and Problem
   2.1. Tower structure. The simplest tourist tower includes (fig.1): Solid mast, top observation desk, 
elevator, expansions, and control stability. The tower is separated into sections by horizontal and 
vertical rods (fig.2) and contains control devices.

  2.2. Filling gas. The compressed gas should fill the tube tower rods that provide the structure's
weight. Author suggests filling the towers with a light gas, for example, hydrogen. 
   The average temperature of the atmosphere in the interval from 0 to 100 km is about 240oK. 
   2.3. The observation radius versus altitude is presented in [8], figs.4-5 [Eq. (23)].  
   2.4. Tower material.  The tower parameters very depend on the strength of material, specifically the 
relation of the safety press stress  to specific density .  Pressure limit is approximately three times 
more then tensile stress for most conventional materials. 
The properties of the some current materials are presented in Table 1.

Current industry widely produces artificial fibers having tensile stress = 500 - 620 kg/mm2 and 
density  = 1800 kg/m3. Their tensile ratio is K =10 -7 /= 0.28 - 0.34. There are whisker (in industry) 
and nanotubes (in scientific laboratory) having tensile K = 1 - 2 (whisker) and K = 5 - 11 (nanotubes). 
Theory predicts fiber, whisker and nanotubes having K ten times greater [5]-[7]. These materials can 
be used for light guy-lines.
  The tower parameters have been computed for pressure K = 0.05 - 0.3. Recommend value for guy-
lines is K = 0.1. 
   2.5. Tower safety. For safety of people (passenger cabin) parachutes can be used.

   2.6. Tower stability. Stability is provided by expansions (tensile elements). The verticality of the 
tower (mast) can be checked by laser beam and GPS sensors monitoring beam location (fig.2). If a 
section deviates from vertical control cables, control devices automatically restore the tower position. 
   2.7.  Tower construction. The tower building will not have conventional construction problems 
such as lifting building material to high altitude. The tower (mast) is not heavy. New sections are put 
under the tower, the new section is lifted, and the entire tower is lifted. It is estimated the building may 
be constructed in 4 -12 months. A small tower (up to 3 km) can be located in city.  
   2.8. Tower cost. The tower does not require high-cost building materials. The tower will be a tens
times cheaper than conventional reinforced concrete towers 400 - 600 m tall.

  The computations for tower height H = 100 km and for tower H = 37,000 km (geosynchronous orbit) 
are presented in fig. 3 - 7.

Fig. 6. Relative tower mass for tower height H=37,000 km (geosynchronous orbit) versus pressure 
stress coefficient K = 0.2 - 0.4.

Fig. 7. Relative tower mass for tower height H=37,000 km (geosynchronous orbit) versus pressure 
stress coefficient K = 0.2 - 1.

  The figs. 3 - 4 show the optimal steel tower (mast) having the height 100 km, safety pressure stress K 
= 0.02  (158 kg/mm2) must have the bottom cross-section area approximately in 100 times more then 
top cross-section area and weight is 135 times more then top load (fig. 4). For example, if full top load 
equals 100 tons (30 tons support extension cable + 70 tons useful load), the total weight of main 
columns 100 km tower-mast (without extension cable) will be 13,500 tons   . It is less that a weight of 
current sky-scrapers (compare with 3,000,000 tons of Toronto tower having the 553 m height). In 
reality if the safety stress coefficient K = 0.015, the relative cross-section area and weight will 
sometimes be more but it is a possibility of current building technology.
  The figs. 5 - 7 show the building of the geosynchronous tower-mast (include the optimal tower-mast)
is very difficult. For K = 0.3 (it is over the top limit margin of safety for quartz, corundum) the tower 
mass is ten millions of times more than load (fig. 6), the extensions must be made from nanotubes and 
they weakly help. The problems of stability and flexibility then appear. The situation is strongly 

7
improved if tower-mast built from diamonds (relative tower mass decreases up 100, fig.7). But it is not 
known when we will receive the cheap artificial diamond in unlimited amount and can create from it
building units.
   2. Using the compressive rods [9]. The rod compressed by gas can keep more compressive force 
because internal gas makes a tensile stress in a rod material. That longitudinal stress cannot be more 
then a half safety tensile stress of road material because the compressed gas creates also a tensile radial 
rod force (stress) which is two times more than longitudinal tensile stress. As the result the rod material 
has a complex stress (compression in a longitudinal direction and a tensile in the radial direction). 
Assume these stress is independent. The gas has a weight which must be added to total steel weight. 
The author used the following equations for computation of the gas compressive rods

For steel and duralumin from Table 1, the internal gas increases K in 35 - 45%. 

  Unfortunately, the gas support depends on temperature (see Eq. (3)). That means the mast can loss 
this support at night. Moreover, the construction will contain the thousands of rods and some of them 
may be not enough leakproof or lose the gas during of a design lifetime. I think it is a danger to use the 
gas pressure rods in space tower.  

Conclusion
 The inexpensive steel tower-mast of the height up 100 - 200 km (and more) can be built without big 
problems at the present time. They can be useful for communication (TV, radio, telephone), for 
radiolocation (defense), for space launch, for tourism (include space tourism), for scientists
(astronomy), for solar energy, and for many other applications. The offered optimal design allows 
finding of the minimum of a tower-mast weight which can be reached in this space building.
The other designs of space towers are in [8]-[15].

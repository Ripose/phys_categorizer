ABSTRACT 

We report a remarkable universality in the patterns of violence arising in three high-

profile  ongoing  wars,  and  in  global  terrorism.  Our  results  suggest  that  these  quite 

different  conflict  arenas  currently  feature  a  common  type  of  enemy,  i.e.  the  various 

insurgent  forces  are  beginning  to  operate  in  a  similar  way  regardless  of  their 

underlying ideologies, motivations and the terrain in which they operate. We provide 

a  microscopic  theory  to  explain  our  main  observations.  This  theory  treats  the 

insurgent  force  as  a  generic,  self-organizing  system  which  is  dynamically  evolving 

through the continual coalescence and fragmentation of its constituent groups.

 The recent terrorist attacks in London, Madrid and New York (i.e. ‘9/11’), killed 

many people in a very short space of time. At the other extreme, the world currently hosts 

several longer-term ‘local’ conflicts within specific countries, in which there is a steady 

stream of new casualties every day. Examples include the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, 

and the longer-term guerrilla war in Colombia which is taking place against a back-drop of 

drug-trafficking and Mafia activity. The origins, motivations, locations and durations of 

these various conflicts are very different -- hence one would expect the details of their 

respective dynamical evolution to also be very different.  

Here we report the remarkable finding that identical patterns of violence are currently 

emerging within these different international arenas. Not only have the wars in Iraq and 

Colombia evolved to yield a same power-law behavior, but this behavior is currently of the 

same quantitative form as the war in Afghanistan and global terrorism in non-G7 countries. 

Our findings suggest that the dynamical evolution of these various examples of modern 

conflict has less to do with geography, ideology, ethnicity or religion and much more to do 

with the day-to-day mechanics of human insurgency; the respective insurgent forces are 

effectively becoming identical in terms of how they operate. Our findings are backed up by 

extensive statistical tests on carefully prepared datasets, as discussed in the Appendices. We 

also provide a microscopic mathematical model which describes how such a ‘common 

enemy’ might be operating. The model represents the insurgent force as an evolving 

population of attack units whose destructive potential varies over time. Not only is the 

model’s power-law behavior in excellent agreement with the data from Iraq, Colombia and 

non-G7 terrorism, it is also consistent with data obtained from the recent war in 

Afghanistan. These findings suggest that modern insurgent wars tend to be driven by the 

same underlying mechanism: the continual coalescence and fragmentation of attack units.

Power-law distributions are known to arise in a large number of physical, biological, 

economic and social systems1.  In the present context, a power-law distribution means that 

the probability that an event will occur with

p x( ) = Cx−α over a 

reasonably wide range of

α positive coefficients.  This in turn implies that a 

 will be a straight line with a negative slope of 

1−α .i  Previous studies have shown that the distribution obtained from ‘old’ 
magnitude 
wars, 1816-1980, exhibits a power-law with α= 1.80 9( )1-4.ii  However each data-point in 

these studies represents the total casualty figure for one particular war.  By contrast, our 

analysis looks at the pattern of casualties arising within a given war. Casualty numbers in 

global terrorist events, from 1968 to the present, are also known to obey power laws where 
in this case each data point is a terrorist attack5: α= 2.5 1( ) for non-G7 countries while 
α= 1.71 3( ) for G7 countries5.  We find that both Iraq and Colombia exhibit power-law 

behavior and that their power-law coefficients are currently close to 2.5, which is exactly 

the value characterizing non-G7 terrorism.  We also find power-law behavior for 

Afghanistan with a coefficient near 2.5.

As well as observing power-law behavior for the time-aggregated data shown in 

Figure 1, we also find power-law behavior over smaller time-windows. We can follow the 

time-evolution of the power-law coefficient α by sliding this time-window through the 

data-series. Figure 2 shows the resulting α values as a function of time, in addition to the 

corresponding 95% confidence bands.  Remarkably, these alpha values have recently

become very close to 2.5 which also happens to be the value for global terrorism in non-G7 

countries and the war in Afghanistan (see below). The implication is that these wars and 

global non-G7 terrorism are showing very similar underlying behavior.

Figure 2 The variation through time of the power-law coefficient α for Iraq and 
Colombia, shown respectively as blue and green lines with square symbols 
together with their corresponding 95% confidence bands.  For Iraq and Colombia 
the time-windows are 400 and 800 days respectively, with each time-window 
sliding forward one month at a time.  The straight lines are fits through these 
points, and suggest a current value of α≈ 2.5 for both wars. The values for G7 and 
non-G7 terrorism are also shown5.  

But why should a seemingly universal value of 2.5 emerge for Iraq, Colombia and 

non-G7 global terrorism? Standard physical mechanisms for generating power laws make 

little sense in the context of Colombia or Iraq1.  One might initially guess that casualties 

 

5

would arise in rough proportion to the population sizes of the places where insurgent 

groups attack: given that city populations may follow a power law1, it is conceivable that 

this would also produce power laws for the severity of attacks.  However, we have tested 

this hypothesis against our Colombia data and it is resoundingly rejected.   

Figure 3 shows a model of modern ‘generic’ insurgent warfare which we have 

developed. Full details are given in the Appendices. Our model proposes that the insurgent 

force operates as a dynamically evolving population of fairly self-contained units, which 

we call 'attack units'. Each attack unit has a particular 'attack strength' characterizing the 

number of casualties which typically arise in an event involving this attack unit. As time 

evolves, these attack units either join forces with other attack units (i.e. coalescence) or 

break up (i.e. fragmentation). Eventually this on-going process of coalescence and 

fragmentation reaches a dynamical steady-state which is solvable analytically, yielding a 

power-law with coefficient 

5.2=α

 (see Appendices). The combination of these empirical 

and analytical findings suggests that similar distributions of attack units are emerging in 

Colombia, Iraq and in non-G7 global terrorism, with each attack unit in an ongoing state of 

coalescence and fragmentation. Furthermore, our model offers the following interpretation 

for the evolution of α  observed in Figure 2: The Iraq war began as a conventional 

confrontation between large armies, but continuous pressure applied to the Iraqis by 

coalition forces has fragmented the insurgency into a structure in which smaller attack 

units, characteristic of non-G7 global terrorism, now predominate.  In Colombia, on the 

other hand, the guerrillas in the early 1990’s had even less ability than global terrorists to 

coalesce into high-impact units but have gradually been acquiring comparable capabilities.  

 

6

Figure 3   Our analytically-solvable model describing modern insurgent warfare. The 
insurgent force comprises attack units, each of which has a particular attack strength. As 
indicated by the dark shadows, this attack strength represents the number of casualties 
which the attack unit would typically inflict in a conflict event. The total attack strength is 
being continually re-distributed through coalescence and fragmentation of the attack units. 
 
 

These empirical and analytical findings lead us to speculate that power-law patterns 

will emerge within any modern asymmetric war which is being fought by loosely-organized 

insurgent groups.  Such generic behavior can be explained using theoretical models which 

describe group formation, rather than having to invoke case-specific issues such as politics 

or geography.  Although future wars will provide the ultimate test of such a claim, Figure 4 

provides some further supporting evidence.  In particular, the casualty figures from the 

recent Afghanistan war follow a power-law with α very close to 2.5.  Additional 

supporting cases will be presented elsewhere.  

 

  

7

Finally, we note that we have obtained access to preliminary databases from a range 

of other insurgent-like wars in recent history. Since we have not been able to subject their 

event entries to the same rigorous scrutiny as those for Iraq, Colombia and Afghanistan, 

any estimates of power-laws from them would be subject to very large error-bars. However, 

it is interesting to note that if we carry out the same exercise as in this paper, and treat the 

resulting estimates at face value, then the average value of α obtained across a broad 

platform of such wars –including Casamance (Senegal), Indonesia, Israel and Northern 

Ireland – is between 2.4 and 2.5.  A detailed discussion of these other conflicts will be 

given elsewhere after we have been able to cross-check the accuracy of the respective 

databases.

PART 1:    Details of the model mentioned in the paper 

Here we provide details of our model of modern insurgent warfare, which we 

introduced in the main paper. Our goal is to provide a plausible model to explain (i) why 

power-law behavior is observed in the Colombia, Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and in non-

G7 global terrorism, and (ii) why the power-law coefficients for the Colombia and Iraq 

wars should both be currently around the value of 2.5, observed in non-G7 terrorism and 

Afghanistan.  

Our model bears some similarity to a model of herding by Cont and Bouchaudiii, and 

is a direct adaptation of the Eguiluz-Zimmerman model of herding in financial marketsiv. 

The analytical derivation which we present, is an adaptation of earlier formalism laid out by 

D’Hulst and Rodgersv, and also draws heavily on the material in the book Financial Market 

Complexity by Neil F. Johnson, Paul Jefferies and Pak Ming Hui (Oxford University Press, 

2003). One of us (NFJ) is extremely grateful to Pak Ming Hui for detailed correspondence 

about the Eguiluz-Zimmerman model of financial markets, the associated formalism, and 

its extensions – and also for discussions involving the present model.  

As suggested by Figure 3 in the paper, our model is based on the plausible notion that 

the total attack capability of a modern insurgent force is being continually re-distributed. 

Based on our intuition about such ‘new’ wars, we consider the insurgent force to be made

up of attack units, with each one having a certain attack strength (see below for a detailed 

discussion). It is reasonable to expect that the total attack strength for the entire insurgent 

force would change fairly slowly over time.  At any particular instant, this total attack 

strength is distributed (i.e. partitioned) among the various attack units -- moreover the 

composition of these attack units, and hence their relative attack strengths, will evolve in 

time as a result of an on-going process of coalescence (i.e. combination of attack units) and 

fragmentation (i.e. breaking up of attack units). Such a process of coalescence and 

fragmentation is realistic for an insurgent force in a guerilla-like war, and will be driven by 

a combination of planned decisions and opportunistic actions by both the insurgent force 

and the incumbent force. For example, separate attack units might coalesce prior to an 

attack, or an individual attack unit might fragment in response to a crackdown by the 

incumbent force. Here we will model this process of coalescence and fragmentation as a 

stochastic process.  

Each attack unit carries a specific label 

K,
 respectively. By attack unit we have in mind a group of people, weapons, 

 and has an attack strength denoted

explosives, machines, or even information, which organizes itself to act as a single unit. In 

the case of people, this means that they are probably connected by location (e.g. they are 

physically together) or connected by some communication system. In the case of a piece of 

equipment, this means that it is readily available for use by members of a particular group. 

The simplest scenario is to just consider people, and in particular a group of insurgents 

which are in such frequent contact that they are able to act as a single group. However, we 

emphasize that an attack unit may also consist of a combination of people and objects – for 

example, explosives plus a few people, such as in the case of suicide bombers. Such an 

attack unit, while only containing a few people, could have a high attack strength. In 

addition, information could also be a valuable part of an attack unit. For example, a lone 

 

13

suicide bomber who knows when a certain place will be densely populated (e.g. a military 

canteen at lunchtimes) and who knows how to get into such a place unnoticed, will also 

represent an attack unit with a high attack strength.  We define the attack strength,

si

, of a 

given attack unit  i, as the average number of people who are typically injured or killed as 

the result of an event involving attack unit  i. In other words, a typical event (e.g. attack or 

clash) involving group   will lead to the injury or death of 

i

 people. This definition covers 

si

both the case of one-sided attacks by attack unit  i (since in this case, all casualties are due 

to the presence of attack unit i) and it also covers two-sided clashes (since presumably there 

would have been no clash, and hence no casualties, if unit  i had not been present). 

We take the sum of the attack strengths over all the attack units (i.e. the total attack 

strength of the insurgent force) to be equal to N . From the definition of attack strength, it 

follows that  N  represents the maximum number of people which would be injured or killed 

in an event, on average, if the entire insurgent force were to act together as a single attack 

unit. Mathematically, 

. For any significant insurgent force, one would 

∑ N=
si
i, j,k,K
  

expect

N >> 1, however the power-law results that we will derive do not depend on any 

particular choice of N . In particular, the power-law result derived in this section concerning 

the average number  ns of attack units having a given attack strength , is invariant under a 

s

global magnification of scale (as are all power-laws).  

Hence our model becomes, in mathematical terms, one in which the total attack 

strength  N  is being continually re-distributed among attack groups as a result of an 

ongoing process of coalescence and fragmentation. As a further clarification of our 

terminology, we will now discuss the two limiting cases which, for convenience, we 

classify as the ‘complete coalescence’ and ‘complete fragmentation’ limits: 

 

14

• 

‘Complete coalescence’ limit: Suppose the conflict is such that all the attack 

units join together or coalesce into a single large attack unit. This would 

correspond to amassing all the available combatants and weaponry in a single 

place – very much like the armies of the past would amass their entire force 

on the field of battle. Hence there is one large attack unit, which we label as   
i

and which has an attack strength

N . All other attack units disappear. 

Hence si → N . This complete coalescence limit has the minimum possible 

number of attack units (i.e. one) but the maximum possible attack strength (i.e. 

N ) in that attack unit. 

• 

‘Complete fragmentation’ limit: Suppose the conflict is such that all the attack 

units fragment into ever smaller attack units. Eventually all attack units will 

have attack strength equal to one. Hence 

si → 1

 for all

i

,2,1 K=

,

N

. This 

would correspond to all combatants operating essentially individually. This 

complete fragmentation limit has the maximum possible number of attack 

units (i.e.  N ) but the minimum possible attack strength per attack unit (i.e. 

one). 

 In practice, of course, one would expect the situation to lie between these two limits 

of complete coalescence and complete fragmentation. In particular, it seems reasonable to 

expect that the attack units and their respective attack strengths will evolve in time within a 

given war. Indeed, one can envisage that the attack units will occasionally either break up 

into smaller groups (i.e. smaller attack units) or join together to form larger ones. The 

reasons are plentiful why this should occur: for example, the opposing forces (e.g. the 

Colombian Armed Forces and National Police in Colombia or Coalition Forces in Iraq or 

Afghanistan) may be applying pressure in terms of searching for hidden insurgent groups. 

 

15

Hence these insurgent groups (i.e. attack units) might either decide, or be forced, to break 

up in order to move more quickly, or in order to lose themselves in the towns or 

countryside.  

Hence attack units with different attack strengths will continually mutate via 

coalescence and fragmentation yielding a ‘soup’ of attack units with a range of attack 

strengths. At any one moment in time, this ‘soup’ corresponds mathematically to 

partitioning the total  N  units of attack strength which the insurgent army possesses. The 

analysis which we now present suggests that the current states of the guerilla/insurgency 

wars in Colombia, Iraq and Afghanistan all correspond to the steady-state limit of such an 

on-going coalescence-fragmentation process. It also suggests that such a process might also 

underpin the acts of terrorism in non-G7 countries, and that such terrorism is characteristic 

of some longer-term ‘global war’.  

Against the backdrop of on-going fragmentation and coalescence of attack units, we 

suppose that each attack unit has a given probability 

p

 of being involved in an event in a 

given time-interval, regardless of its attack strength. For example, p could represent the 

probability that an arbitrarily chosen attack unit comes across an undefended target – or 

vice versa, the probability that an arbitrarily chosen attack unit finds itself under attack. In 

these instances, p should be relatively insensitive to the actual attack strength of the attack 

unit involved: given this condition, the results which we shall derive for the distribution of 

attack strengths can also be used to describe the distribution of events having a given 

severity. When obtaining our results, we shall assume that the war has been underway for a 

long time and hence some kind of steady-state has been reached. This latter assumption is 

plausible for the conflicts in Colombia, Iraq and Afghanistan, and also for non-G7 

terrorism. Given these considerations, it follows that if there are on average 

ns attack units 

 

16

of a given attack strength , then the number of events involving an attack unit of attack 

s

strength 

s

 will be proportional to

ns. We assume, quite realistically, that only one insurgent 

attack group participates in a given event. For example, attacks in which 10 people are 

killed are due to an attack by a unit of attack strength 10 as opposed to simultaneous attacks 

by a unit of strength 6 and a unit of strength 4 (i.e. 6+4=10). Hence the number of events in 

which 

s

 people were killed and/or injured, is just proportional to n

s. In other words, the 

histogram, and hence power-law, that we will derive for the dependence of  ns on , will 

s

also describe the number of events with 

s

 casualties versus . Indeed, if we consider that an 

s

event will typically have duration of T, and that there will only be a few such events in a 

given interval T, then these results should also appear similar to the distribution describing 

the number of intervals of duration T in which there were 

s

 casualties, versus . This is 

s

indeed what we have found in our analysis of the empirical data.  

Given the above discussion, our task of analyzing and deducing the average number 

of events with 

s

 casualties versus 

s

 over a given period of time becomes equivalent to the 

task of analyzing and deducing the average number  n

s of attack units of a given attack 

strength 

s

 in that same period of time. This is what we will now calculate. We will start by 

considering a reasonable mechanism for the coalescence and fragmentation of attack 

groups, before then finally deducing analytically the corresponding power-law behavior 

and obtaining a power-law coefficient equal to 2.5. 

Consider an arbitrary attack unit   with attack strength . At any one instant in time, 

i

si

labeled , we assume that this attack unit will do any one of three things: 

t

a)  fragment (i.e. break up) into 

 attack units of attack strength equal to 1. This 

s
i

feature aims to mimic an insurgent group which decides, either voluntarily or 

 

17

involuntarily, to split itself up (e.g. in order to reduce the chance of being 

captured and/or to mislead the enemy).  

b)  coalesce (i.e. combine) with another attack unit  j of attack strength 

s j

, hence 

forming a single attack unit of attack strength 

si + s j. This feature mimics two 

insurgent groups finding each other by chance (e.g. in the Colombian jungle) 

or deciding via radio communication to meet up and join forces.  

c)  remain unchanged. This feature mimics an insurgent group which has no 

reason to split itself up, nor does it have a reason to coalesce with another 

attack unit. 

To implement this process for each possible attack unit and at every timestep, we proceed 

as follows.  At each timestep, we choose an attack unit   at random but with a probability 

i

which is proportional to its attack strength . With a probability

ν, this attack unit  i with 

si

attack strength 

  fragments into 

 attack units with attack strength 1. A justification for 

si

si

choosing attack unit   with a probability which is proportional to its attack strength is as 

i

follows: attack units with higher attack strength are likely to be bigger and hence will either 

run across the enemy more and/or be more actively sought by the enemy. By contrast, with 

a probability 

1−ν(

) , the chosen attack unit  i instead coalesces with another attack unit  j  

which is chosen at random, but again with a probability which is proportional to its attack 

strength . The two attack units of attack strengths 

s j

si

 and 

sj

 then combine to form a bigger 

attack unit of attack strength 

si + s j

. The justification for choosing attack unit 

j  for 

coalescence with a probability which is proportional to its attack strength is as follows: it is 

presumably risky to combine attack units, since it must involve at least one message 

passing between the two units in order to coordinate their actions. Hence it becomes 

increasingly less worthwhile to combine attack units as the attack units get smaller.

This model is thus characterized by a single parameterν. The connectivity among the 

attack units is driven by the dynamics of the model. For very small ν (i.e. much less than 

1), the attack units steadily coalesce. This leads to the formation of large attack units. In the 

other limit of ν→ 1, the system consists of many attack units with attack strength close to 

1. A value of ν= 0.01 corresponds to about one fragmentation in every 100 iterations. In 

what follows, we assume that ν is small since the process of fragmentation should not be 

very frequent for any insurgent force which is managing to sustain an ongoing war. Indeed 

if such fragmentation were very frequent, then this would imply that the insurgents were 

being so pressured by the incumbent force that they had to fragment at nearly every 

timestep. Hence that particular war should not last very long. It turns out that infrequent 

fragmentations are sufficient to yield a steady-state process, and will also yield the power-

law behavior which we observe for Colombia and Iraq.  

A typical result obtained from numerical simulations of this model, for the 

distribution of  ns versus attack strength 

s

 in the long-time limit (i.e. steady-state), is shown 

below in terms of 

ns n1 :

Figure S1:  Log-log plot of the number of attack units with attack strength s, versus 

attack strength s. Here  N = 10,000 andν= 0.01. The results are obtained from a 

numerical simulation of the model. The initial conditions of this numerical 

simulation are such that all attack units have size 1 -- however, changing this initial 

condition does not change the main results which emerge in the steady state. As 

time evolves, the attack units undergo coalescence and fragmentation as 

described in the text. In the long-time limit, the system reaches a steady-state with 

power-law dependence as shown in the figure and with an associated power-law 

 

 

20

coefficient of 2.5 (i.e. 5/2). The deviation from power-law behavior at large s is 

simply due to the finite value of N: since there can be no attack unit with attack 

strength greater than N, the finite size of N distorts the power-law as s approaches 

N. 

 

We now provide an analytic derivation of the observed power-law behavior, and 

specifically the power-law coefficient 2.5, in the steady-state (i.e. long-time) limit. 

One can write a dynamical equation for the evolution of the model at different levels 

of approximation. For example, one could start with a microscopic description of the 

system by noting that at any moment in time, the entire insurgent army can be described by 

a partition 

{
l1,l2,K,lN
  

}
 of the total attack strength 

N  into  N  attack units. Here  ls is the 

number of attack units of attack strength . For example 

s

{
0,0,K,1
 

} corresponds to the 

'complete coalescence' limit discussed earlier, in which all the attack strength is 

concentrated in one big attack unit. By contrast, 

} corresponds to the 'complete 

{
N,0,K,0
 

fragmentation' limit in which all the attack units have attack strength of 1 (i.e. there are  N  

attack units of attack strength 1). Clearly, the total amount of attack strength is 

.  All that happens is that the way in which this total attack strength N 

conserved

∑   =  N
ili

N

i=1

is partitioned will change in time.  

In principle, the dynamics could be described by the time-evolution of the probability 

function

]
: in particular, taking the continuous-time limit would yield an 

equation for 

dt  in terms of transitions between partitions. For example, the

convenient to work with the average number  ns  of attack units of attack strength , which 

 leads to a transition from the partition

The terms on the right-hand side of Equation (0.1) represent all the ways in which  ns can 

change. The first term represents a decrease in  ns  due to the fragmentation of an attack unit 

of attack strength : this happens only if an attack unit of attack strength 

s

s

 is chosen and if 

fragmentation then follows. The former occurs with probability 

s ns N  (see earlier 

discussion) and the latter with probabilityν. The second term represents an increase in  ns  

as a result of the merging of an attack unit of attack strength 

s'

 with an attack unit of attack 

strength

)
(
s − s'

. The third term describes the decrease in 

ns  due to the merging of an attack 

unit of attack strength 

s

 with any other attack unit. For the 

s = 1 case described by Equation 

(0.2), the chosen attack unit remains isolated; thus Equation (0.2) does not have a 

contribution like the first term of Equation (0.1). The first term which appears in Equation 

(0.2) reflects the increase in the number of attack units of attack strength equal to 1, due to 

fragmentation of an attack unit. Similarly to Equation (0.1), the last term of Equation (0.2) 

describes the merging of an attack unit with attack strength 1, with an attack unit of any 

other attack strength. Equations (0.1) and (0.2) are so-called ‘master equations’ describing 

 

 

22

the dynamics within the model. Note that for simplicity, we are only considering 

fragmentation into attack units of attack strength 1. However this could be generalized – 

indeed, we will look at more general fragmentations in future publications. 

In the long-time steady state limit, Equations (0.1) and (0.2) yield:

Equations of this type are most conveniently treated using the general technique of 

‘generating functions’. As the name suggests, these are functions which can be used to 

generate a range of useful quantities. Consider

∑

s' = 0

s ns =

G(s) 0[ ]

where  y = e −ω  is a parameter. Note that  s ns N  is the probability of finding an attack unit 

of attack strength . If G y  is known, 
s

s ns is then formally given by  

[ ]

where G(s) y[ ] is the  -th derivative of G y
s

[ ]with respect to  y . G(s) y[ ] can be decomposed 

G y[ ]= n1 y +

∑ y s' ≡ n1 y + g y[ ]

s' = 2

where the function 

 governs the attack-units’ attack-strength distribution 

ns  for

s ≥ 2

. 

g y[ ]

The next task is to obtain an equation for

g y[ ]. This can be done in two ways. One could 

either write down the terms in 

 explicitly and then make use of Equation (0.3), or

The resulting equation is:

Equation (0.17). We follow these mathematical steps (which were derived in the M.Phil.

s−5 2 

which shows that at large s, there will be an exponential cut-off. This makes sense since the 

coalescence process for attack units with very large attack strength will always be 

hampered by the fact th

at the total insurgent attack strength N is itself finite -- indeed, such 

a cut-off at large s is also observed in the empirical war data. For sufficiently small values 

ofν, the dominant dependence on  s over a wide range of intermediate s-values will be 

ns ~ s− 5 2

hence ns ~ s−2.5 

(0.

20) 

This analysis therefore shows analytically that the distribution of attack strengths should 

follow a power-law with exponent 

α= 2.5 (i.e. 5/2) over a fairly wide range of values of s. 

As discussed earlier, we assume that any particular attack unit could be involved in an 

event in a given time interval, with a probability p which is independent of its attack size. 

Hence these power-law results which we have derived for the distribution of attack 

strengths, will also apply to the distribution of attacks of severity x. (Recall that the attack 

strength s is a measure of the number of casualties in a typical event, and that the severi

ty x 

of an event is measured as the number of casualties). In other words, the same power-law 

 

 

 

 

 

26

exponent α= 2.5 derived in Equation (0.20), will also apply to the distribution of at

tacks 

having severity x.  

 

Hence our model predicts that any guerrilla-like war which is characterized by 

an ongoing process of coalescence and fragmentation of attack units, and hence an 

ongoing re-

distribut

ion of the total attack strength, will have the following properties:  

(i) 

The distribution of events w

ith severity x will follow a power-law. This finding is 

consisten

t wi

th the behavior observed for the aggregated data in the Iraq, Afghanistan 

and Colombia w rs (see Figure 1 of the paper). 

a

(ii) The pow

er-law

 distribution will, in the steady-state (i.e. long-time) limit, have an 

exponent

α= 2.5. This is precisely the value which the on-going wars in Colombia and 

Iraq seem to have reached in recent months (see Figure 2 of the paper) and that 

Afghanistan exhibits for the whole sample period (see Figure 4 of the paper). 

 

We will now attempt to go one step further by providing a generalization of the 

above 

model in order to offer an explanation for the temporal evolution of the power-law
 

coefficient 

α which was observed in Figure 2. For technical reasons related to the 

mathematics of the generating-function approach which we employ, the analytic results 

which we will obtain for the power-law coefficient α will be more approximate than in the 

 
earlier case. However, we have performed numerical simulations to check that these

analytic results are still in fact reliable -- furthermore, these analytic results will end

 up 

offering important insights into the temporal behavior of 

α which is observed in Figure 2.  

 

27

Our generalized model is as follows. Exactly as before, at each timestep an attack 

unit 

is randomly picked to be a candidate for the fragmentation-coalescence process. Also as 

before, the probability of being picked is proportional to its attack strength. We retain this 

feature of having the probability of being picked as being proportional to the attack 

strength, since it makes sense to us -- for example, the larger an attack unit, the more likely 

it will be that it is discovered by opposing forces (and hence may need to decide whether to 

fragment) or that it itself comes across another attack unit and therefore may need to decide 

whether to coalesce. In short, it makes sense to us that, on a daily basis, the larger the attack 

unit is in terms of its attack strength then the more likely it is that it will become a 

candidate for fragmentation or coalescence. In other words, it seems reasonable to us that 

the larger the attack strength, the more likely it is that one of the attack unit's constituent 

parts will become faced with a situation which could lead to fragmentation or coalescence. 

We now move on to the details of the fragmentation-coalescence process, since this is 

where the generalization will occur. Suppose a particular attack unit   has been picked at a 

i

particular timestep, and that it has an attack strength  si. As before, it is then selected for 

fragmentation with a probability

n
ν, and for coalesce ce with a probability

1−ν. However 

unlike the earlier version, it does not necessarily undergo either (hence our use of the word 

'selected'). Instead, the rules are as follows. Suppose it gets selected for fragmentation: it 

will now fragment with a probability  f si[ ] which depends on si. Suppose instead that it 

gets selected for coalescence: as before, a second attack unit  j is then picked randomly 

with a probability which is proportional to its attack strength s j. However unlike the earlie
r 

version, these two attack units will no

w coalesce with a probability  [ ] f s j[ ] which 

f si

depends on  si and s j. Hence even if a given attack unit is selected for fragmentation or 

coalescence, neither process is now guaranteed to occur.  

 

28

The upshot of this generalization is that there are now effectively three probabilist

ic 

processes at each timestep:  

(1) an

 initial random picking (biased according to attack strength) in order to select an 

attack unit as a candidate for

 the fragmentation-coalescence process;  

(2) a coin-toss (biased according to the value of ν) in order to decide whether this 

particular attack unit is being selected for fragmentation or for coalescence. In terms of the 

mechanics of a war, ν is the probability that this a tack unit is confronted with a situation 

t

which might lead to fragmentation, while 1

−ν is the probability that this attack unit is 

confronted with a situation which might lead to coalescence;  

(3) another coin-toss (biased according to 

f si[ ]

 for fragmentation, and  f si[ ]f sj[ ] for 

coalescence) to decide whether the attack unit actually goes through w

ith the fragm

entation 

or coalescence process for which it has bee

n se

lected. Note that the basi

c version 

of the
 

model, which we studied in detail above, corresponds to the simple case with 
f s[ ]= 1 for all values of  s  and s .

s' = N  and hence Equation (0.29) reduces to

 the result in Equation

equivalently ns ~ s− 2.5−δ(

(

now has a highly non-trivial dependence on s, numerical simulations show that it is 

reasonably accurate.   

We can therefore can see that by decreasing δ from  0.7 → 0 (i.e. by increasing 

the relative fragmentation/coalescence rates of

 larger a

tta

ck units) w

e span the entire 

spectrum of power-law exponents observed in the Iraq w  (see Figure 2) from the 

ar

initial value of 1.8, up to the current value

 of approximately 2.5. This effect of 

decreasing 

δ from 

0.7 → 0

 corresponds in our model to a relative increase in the 

tendency for larger a tack units to fragment at each timestep. In other words, 

t

decreasing 

δ mimics the effect of decreasing the relative robustness or ‘lifetime’ of 

larger attack units. A somewhat similar argument applies to Colombia using negative 

 

 

 

 

31

values forδ: by increasing δ from about  −0.5 → 0  we span the spectrum of power-la

w 

exponents observed in the Colombia war (see Figure 2) from the initial value of near 

3, down to the current value of approxim

ately 2.5.

 This effect of increasing 

δ 

corresponds in our model to a relative decrease in the tendency for larger attack units

 

a
to fragment at each timestep. As suggested above, for technical reasons this  r

gument 

is slightly less satisfactory than for the case of Iraq -- this is because f s[ ] will now need 

to have a non-monotonic functional form since it must still normalize to 1 over all s. 

 

Going further, we note that the above theoretical results are consisten  with, and to 

t

some extent explain

, the various pow

er-law exponents found for: 

(1) Conventional wars. T

he corresponding power-law exponent 1.8 referred to in the paper 

for conventional wars, can now be interpreted through our generalized model (with 

δ≈ 0.7) 

as a tendency toward building larger, robust attack units with a fixed attack strength as in a 

conventional army -- as opposed to attack units with rapidly fluctuating attack streng

 
ths as

a result of frequent fragmentation and coalescence processes. There is also a tendency to 

form a distribution of attack units with a wider spectrum of attack strengths – this is again 

consistent with the composition of ‘conventional’ armies. 

(2) Terrorism in G7 countries. The corresponding power-law exponent 1.7 for G7 terrorism 

can now be interpreted through our generalized model (with 

δ≈ 0.8) as an even stronger 

tendency for robust units (e.g. terrorist cells) to form. There is also an increased tendency to 

form larger units – or equivalently, to operate as part of a large organization. 

(3) Terrorism in non-G7 countries. The corresponding power-law exponent 2.5 for non-G7 

terrorism can now be interpreted through our model (with

δ= 0) as a tendency toward more 

 

32

transient attack units than for G7 terrorism, with attack strengths which are continually 

evolving dynamically as a result of an on-going fragmentation and coalescence process. 

Unlike a conventional army, there will be a tendency to form smaller attack units rather 

than larger ones. 

in such terms: 

As suggested above, the evolution of the wars in Colombia and Iraq can also be discussed 

War in Colombia. At the beginning of the 1990’s, the power-law exponent was very high. 

Then over the following 15 years, it gradually lowered and has hovered near 2.5 from 1999 

onwards. Using our model, the interpretation is that the war at the beginning of the 1990’s 

was such that the guerrillas favored having small attack units. This is possibly because they 

lacked communications infrastructure, and/or did not feel any safety in larger numbers. The
 

decrease toward the value 2.5, suggests that this has changed – probably because of 

increased infrastructure and communications, enabling attack units with a wide range of 

attack strengths to build up. 

War in Iraq. At the beginning of the war in 2003, the power-law exponent was quite low 

and was essentially the same value as conventional wars. This is consistent with the war 

being fought by a conventional Iraqi army against the Coalition forces. There is then a 

break in this value after a few months (i.e. the conventional war ended) and following thi

s, 

the power-law exponent gradually rose towards 2.5. This suggests that the insurgents ha

ve 

been increasingly favoring more temporary attack units, with an increasingly rapid 

fragmentation-coalescence process. This finding could be interpreted as being a result of 

increased success by the Coalition Forces in terms of forcing the insurgents to fragm

ent. On 

 

 

33

the other hand, it also means that the Iraq War has now moved to a value ofα, and hence 

character, which is consistent with generic non-G7 terrorism and it may therefore be hard to 

make further progress against them. 

  

 

 

Finally we comment in more detail on the generality of the model. As noted by 

D'Hulst and Rodgers (see preprint cond-mat/9908481 at xxx.lanl.gov) the power-law 

exponent of 2.5 in this model seems to survive under a range of different generalization

s. In 

particular, if the number of attack units which can coalesce at a given timestep is any 

number m, as opposed to simply m=2 as in the present version, the power-law exponent 

remains unchanged at exactly 2.5. D'Hulst and Rodgers suggest that allowing for a var

iable 

m, or a different process of fragmentation -- such as allowing some agents to remain 

connected after a fragmentation process -- will also preserve the value of the power-law 

exponent around 2.5. We have investigated such robustness further, with the help of B

en 

Burnett and Alex Dixon at University of Oxford, Department of Physics. Their findings, 

which are both analytic and numerical, confirm this general result of the robustness of the

 

value 2.5. Indeed, we have even extended the model to account for several co-existing 

insurgent groups, and also for having one particular insurgent group have a 'home 

advantage' in clashes. A power-law still emerges, and it still seems to have an exponent α 

in the range 1.5 to 3.5. Hence one could say that despite the inherent uncertainty co

ncerning 

the precise microscopic rules which describe a particular conflict, the value of the 2.5 for 

the power-law exponent will represent a good a priori expected value. Even though the 

form of the high-s cutoff may depend on the details of the particular conflict, we can 

conclude that the presence of a power-law with an exponent 

α of roughly 2.5 over a 

reasonably wide of range of s values is indicative of something generic in the mechan

ics of 

the conflict. In particular, it suggests that the way in which m itarily inferior insurgen

il

t 

34

armies mount attacks against incumbent forces, is generic. This in turn suggests that any 

group of humans would end up waging war in the same way, if they were to be found 

fighting in such an asymmetric situation and without any dominant central coordination. 

 

In light of the above discussion and findings, we are confident that the value of 2.5 

which is seen to be the current value in Iraq and Colombia, and is also very similar to other 

modern wars such as Afghanistan, is indeed a meaningful and significant value, and that the

 

underlying common mechanism is indeed one of coalescence and fragmentation by the 

insurgent army.

PART 2: Data and methods

Data: For Colombia, we are able to work with the very broad measure of all conflict-

related killings plus injuries taken from the CERAC Colombia Conflict Database (CCCD).  

The CCCD builds on primary source compilations of violent events by Colombian human 

rights NGO’s and from local and national press reports.  We distil from this foundation all 

the clear conflict events, i.e., those that have a military effect and reflect the actions of a 

group participating in the armed conflict.  For each event we record the participating 

groups, the type of event (massacre, bombing, clash, etc.), the location, the methods used 

and the number of killings and injuries of people in various categories (guerrillas, civilians, 

etc.).  This data set covers the years 1988-2004 and includes 20,227 events.  More 

information is available at http://www.cerac.org.co/ .  Since the materials found on this 

website give very detailed descriptions of CCCD, we will not reproduce such details here. 

 

For Iraq we work with the CERAC Integrated Iraq Dataset (CIID).  The CIID builds 

on the event description from three datasets that monitor violence in Iraq: Iraq Body Count 

(http://www.iraqbodycount.net/), iCasualties (http://iCasualties.org/oif/) and ITERATE 

(http://www.cba.ua.edu/~wenders/).  All three sources contain event data on the Iraq war 

from its beginning on March 20, 2003.  The first two are continually updated whereas 

ITERATE is updated on an annual basis so at present only extends through the end of 2004.  

As we discuss below, ITERATE has a very small impact on CIID so the fact that it stops 

early does not affect the work of this paper.   

The Iraq Body Count Project (IBC) monitors the reporting of more than 30 

respected online news sources, recording only events covered by at least two of them.  For 

each event IBC logs the date, time, location, target, weapon, estimates of the minimum and 

 

 

36

maximum number of civilian deaths and the sources of the information.vii  IBC attaches the 

most confidence to their figures on the minimum number of killings in each event so the 

figures in the paper are based on these minimum numbers.  However, figure S8 (below) 

shows that Figure 1 changes very little if we substitute the maximum number of killings for 

the minimum number of killings.  The concept of civilian is broad, including, for example, 

policemen.  The list of events, posted online, covers the full range of war activity, including 

suicide bombings, roadside bombings, US air strikes, car bombs, artillery strikes and 

individual assassinations.   

 

The IBC data has two principle drawbacks which need to be addressed in order for 

the reader to have confidence in our results.  First, some lines in the IBC spreadsheet 

contain entries that are not proper events.  The most important entries of this form are based 

on reports from morgues around Iraq.  For example, entry x355a lists 26 deaths between 

May 1, 2003 and May 31, 2003 described as “Violent deaths recorded at the provincial 

morgue of Karbala”.  The following hypothetical calculation illustrates how IBC handles 

these entries.  The Karbala morgue actually reports a higher figure, say 39 violent deaths 

for May of 2003.  However, IBC already has two events in Karbala for May of 2003, a car 

bomb killing 4 and a suicide bombing killing 5.  It is likely that these 9 deaths are included 

among the 39 violent deaths recorded by the Karbala morgue so IBC subtracts them off, 

leaving 30.  In addition, the murder rate in Karbala before the war was 4 per months so we 

might expect that 4 out of the remaining violent deaths would have happened even without 

the war.  IBC subtracts off these 4 leaving the figure of 26 which is the one they enter into 

the database.  This procedure is reasonable on its own terms, however deeply problematic 

for our purposes in this paper for two reasons.  First, most of the deaths in entries of this 

                                                 

vii IBC also records injuries but does not post this information on its open website. 

 

37

form are likely to have occurred as single homicides since larger conflict events would be 

likely to have their own entry.  Clearly we would not wish to treat 26 individual homicides 

as one event in which 26 people were killed.  Second, most of the killings in events of this 

form are more tied to crime than to the conflict directly and we prefer to focus on a narrow 

definition of conflict killing.  For these reasons we delete from the IBC database entries of 

this nature.  We provide a list of events we deleted from IBC in Part 4 of the Appendices. 

 

The second drawback of IBC is that it measures only civilian deaths, albeit with a 

wide concept of civilian.  Therefore, to get of fuller picture of the conflict we have added in 

events from iCasualties in which coalition military personnel and contractors are killed in 

conflict events (but not in accidents).  This is a highly reliable source as the military 

services keep solid records on the fate of their own personnel.  Finally, as a check for 

coverage of IBC and iCausualties we also integrated events from ITERATE, which is a 

global terrorism database that records terrorism events of international significance.   

 

This integration required careful matching of events between the three sources to 

avoid double counting.  The following Venn diagrams give the results of this matching 

work, with event counts and numbers of killings accounted for by these events in 

parentheses below.  They show that most of the deaths in CIID come from IBC alone but 

that iCasualties does make a significant contribution.  The overlap between IBC and 

iCasualties is small, since they are measuring different things.  However, there is some 

overlap because sometimes both military personnel and civilians are killed in a single 

incident.  The impact of adding ITERATE into CIID is negligible, indicating that IBC and 

iCasualties give very full coverage of the Iraq war.

03/20/03 – 10/23/05 and 5/1/03 – 10/23/05.  Overlaps indicate that the same event is 

reported in multiple sources.  The diagram gives the number of events with various 

degrees of overlap and (in parentheses) the minimum estimate of the number of 

killings accounted for by these events. 

 

The Iraq war breaks naturally into two phases.  In the first phase, roughly from 

March 20, 2003 to April 30, 2003 the conflict had the character of a conventional war, 

marked by heavy aerial bombardments and a big push across Iraq by coalition land forces.  

From May 1, 2003 the war took on an “irregular” or “insurgent” character.  Accordingly, in 

figure 1 we used just the 3,333 events from May 1, 2003 until October 23, 2005 to ensure 

maximum comparability to the Colombian data.  However, figure S3 (below) shows that 

we get similar results if we use the combined data from both phases.  Figure 2, showing the 

evolution of both conflicts, uses all the Iraq data beginning from March 20, 2003 to 

October 23, 2005.  

We note that the largest level of killings in events shown in Figure 1, according to 

the CIID database, occurred in Baghdad in 8/31/05 (965 killed) and in Fallujah where there 

 

 

39

were two multi-day sieges: the first between 11/8/04 - 11/30/04 (581 killed) and the second 

between 4/5/04 and 4/30/04 (572 killed) which we have necessarily had to treat as single 

events. It turns out that even if we choose to exclude these three events, there is only a 

small impact on the parameter estimation in Figure 1, raising

minx

 from 7 to 8 and 

α from 

2.31 to 2.42. Hence we are confident that our results are not distorted by the method chosen 

to characterize these particular large events. We also note that the Colombia curve is less 

noisy at high  x  because that war has more events in this region. 

 

The CERAC Integrated Afghanistan Database (CIAD) is constructed very similarly 

to CIID.  Two of the basic sources, iCasualties and ITERATE, are the same as in CIID, and 

provide 126 and 29 events respectively to CIAD.  The only difference is that IBC is 

replaced by data on Afghanistan provided by Marc Herold 

(http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mwherold/).  This project provided the original model for IBC 

and so has a very similar nature.  Herold monitors a large number of English language 

sources on the conflict in Afghanistan and provides a list of events with minimum and 

maximum killings on his web site.  (Figure S9 shows that our results are robust to whether 

we use minimum killings or maximum killings.)  The data comes in two separate files, the 

Afghanistan Daily Count database (ADC) with 763 events and the Day by Day Chronicle 

(DBDC) with 608 events.  ADC covers killings of Afghan civilians attributed to coalition 

forces during the period October 7, 2001 to June 3, 2003.  DBDC covers May 31, 2003 to 

July 31, 2004 and covers both civilian and military casualties, although this expansion has 

only a small impact on CIAD which already integrates information from iCasualties.  CIAD 

holds a total of 1430 registries between October 7, 2001 and July 31, 2004.

proceeds as follows. Generate a new dataset where each point is a random draw from the 

empirical distribution of the (observed) data given

. This draw contains a number of 

minx

data points exactly equal to the number of points in the original estimated power law.  

Repeat this process to create 2500 such datasets. Keeping 

 fixed we then estimate the 

minx

                                                 

viii For all three cases in this paper we used 

50=K

. 

 

42

α parameter for each dataset by maximum likelihood estimation as defined in equation 

(0.31) and thus we obtain the distribution of the 2500 “bootstrapped” alphas.  The limits of 

the 95% confidence interval are given by the percentiles 2.5 and 97.5 of this distribution, 

respectively.  

 

An alternative method for calculating confidence intervals on our αestimates uses 

the well-known property of asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimators.  

We prefer the bootstrap approach because it can display the stochastic properties of the 

maximum likelihood estimator well, even in small samples when there can be significant 

departures from normality.  We find no difference in the two approaches for our large 

Colombia dataset but the two approaches do differ for Iraq and Afghanistan.  

 

Next we test the null hypothesis that the data follows the power-law estimated 

according to the above procedure.  First, we randomly draw 2000 samples, each generated 

from the theoretical power-law distribution given by the estimated αand 

minx

and each with 

the same number of data points as in the observed data for

x ≥

minx

.  We compute the KS 

statistic, comparing these samples to the theoretical distribution to obtain the distribution of 

the KS test statistic, conditional on the true data generation process being a power law with 

the estimated 

αand 

minx

.  From this we calculate the probability that a power law with this 

estimated 

αand 

minx

 would generate a KS statistic bigger than the one we found in Step 4 

of the above procedure on the real data.  For all three conflicts, these p values always come 

out far above any standard critical level. 

To further test the reliability of our result, we use the same Monte Carlo procedure 

just described above to compare our data against the lognormal distribution. This is a 

natural comparator, as the lognormal shares some features of the power law distribution: 

they both exhibit fat tails; they are both defined only for positive values; and most 

 

 

43

importantly, the lognormal distribution could possibly resemble a straight line for some 

ranges of 

1X . Again, we use the KS goodness-of-fit statistic to perform a test of rejection 

of the null of lognormality; in this case the test is calculated over all casualty levels, above 

and below

minx

, to see whether the whole sample follows a lognormal distribution. Results 

of these tests with the associated p-values are presented in Table T2 and suggest that we 

cannot reject with any reasonable degree of confidence the hypothesis that our data does 

not follow a lognormal distribution. In other words we can be confident that the data 

follows a power-law distribution, and does not follow a lognormal one. 

For Figure 2, we calculated theα’s for a sequence of sliding time windows for both 

Iraq and Colombia.  This work follows the time evolution of the power-law coefficient α 

through monthly estimation, using fixed-width time windows within each conflict to 

determine the sample-defined path of the estimatedα.  For Colombia each window was 

800 days long, and we slid it forward one month at a time.  For Iraq we used 400 day time-

windows which we also slid forward one month at a time.  Events in the Colombia conflict 

are roughly half as frequent as in Iraq, so we took advantage of the long run of Colombia 

data and built longer time-windows for Colombia than we did for Iraq.  Figure 2 also 

displays symmetric confidence bands at 95%.ix As a further check, we then repeated the 

calculation of α for several different sizes of the time-windows and for the overlap interval 

which slides it forward in time. None of these modifications affected our main results or 

conclusions. Figure S6 show results with a 2,500 day time-window sliding every 60 months 

for Colombia, and a 365 day time-window displaced every 8 months for Iraq. Figure S7 

                                                 

ix For these confidence intervals, we used the asymptotic normality of the ML estimator rather than 

bootstrapping.  The latter approach makes extreme computational demands, given the number of confidence 

intervals to compute. 

 

44

shows a moving time window of two years displaced every year for Colombia, and a 250 

day interval displaced every 150 days for Iraq. As can be seen, our results are essentially 

unchanged by these variations.  Furthermore, our results (whose details are available from 

the authors upon request) are statistically robust to the exclusion of high leverage points 

and extreme value observations. 

It is instructive to compare our discrete maximum likelihood (DML) estimator to 

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and continuous maximum likelihood (CML) estimators (see 

Ref. [1] for a discussion regarding the different types of estimators).  Table T1 shows the 

results of numerical Monte Carlo simulations using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for 

different sample sizes and varying 

 for a theoretical power-law distribution with a fixed

x Simulations were performed with random samples of 100, 500, 1,000 and 5,000 and with 4,000 replications. 

xi The MSE represents the expected squared distance of the estimator from the population value; i.e., as the 

MSE is the sum of the squared bias and the variance of the estimator it is a weighted summary of the bias and 

its efficiency, see Wooldridge, Jeffrey M., 2003, Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 2 ed.,

Table T1 Mean Square Error and Bias of the three feasible estimators for the 

estimation of the αpower-law parameter for varying levels of 

minx

values and 

sample sizes in Monte Carlo simulations with 4,000 replications. 

Furthermore, Table T1 also shows the bias of each one of the possible estimators to 

use.  We find that the DML estimator has the lowest (upward) bias, that this bias falls 

rapidly with larger sample sizes and does not depend on the 

 value. On the other hand, 

minx

the CML estimator has the largest (upward) bias of all, although for high 

minx

 values this 

bias becomes rather small. The bias of the CML estimator does not fall as the sample size 

grows. Finally, we find that the OLS estimator has a (downward) bias which does not 

depends on the sample size or the 

values.  Figure S4 shows the distributions of the 

minx

three estimators for a Monte Carlo simulation with a sample size of 500 and an 

x

min =

5

Table T2 Here we use a variety of measures of the impact of violent events to 

show that our results vary little depending on the choice of violence variables.  For 

Colombia we try killings (K), injuries (I) and, as in the paper, killings plus K and I.  

For Iraq and Afghanistan we use minimum killings, Kmin , as in the paper, and also 

maximum killings, Kmax.  Our α parameter estimate is the maximum likelihood 

estimator for a discrete power law. For further discussion, see PART 2 of these 

Appendices.

Figure S5 This is the same as Figure 1 but with the whole Iraq war beginning 

20/03/03 rather than 01/05/03.  The results are very similar but Iraq now has a 

lower

 (4) and a slightly lower alpha (2.12 vs. 2.31).

Figure S6 This gives the variation through time of the power-law coefficient α for 

each war, using much longer time-windows than those used in Figure 2 of the 

paper.  For Colombia we use three 2,500 day intervals displaced by 60 months.  

For Iraq there are three 365 day intervals displaced every 8 months.  Despite this 

change in size of the windows and how they slide across time, both curves do 

seem to be heading toward 2.5 as in Figure 2 of the paper. For further discussion, 

see PART 2 of these Appendices.

Figure S7 This gives the variation through time of the power-law coefficient α for

displaced every 6 months for Iraq.  Again, they both seem to be moving toward 2.5,

  describing events

 for the minimum possible value and maximum possible value of 

each event in the Afghanistan dataset.  The main features of the results, such as 

the slopes, are similar for the two measures. Most importantly, as noted in Table 

T2, we find that (a) we cannot reject a power-law in either case, and (b) we can 

reject lognormality in both cases. For further discussions, see PART 2 of these 

Appendices. 

 

Finally we comment on an important advantage of focusing on the value of α in 

order to characterize wars, as we have done in this paper. This advantage concerns possible 

over- or under-reporting of war casualties. In particular, it can be shown that α is 

 

53

insensitive to systematic over-reporting or under-reporting of casualties. This is because 

any systematic multiplication of the raw numbers by some constant factor has no effect on 

the α value (i.e. slope) which emerges from the log-log plot for a power-law. Such 

systematic multiplication just rescales the intercept, leaving the slope unchanged.

PART 5: An explanation of how the results in this document represent an 
extensive test, check and confirmation of the findings reported earlier in 
preprint physics/0506213, which is available at: 

http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/physics/0506213

This document supercedes preprint physics/0506213 in that it contains: 

(1) analysis of additional datasets for other conflicts -- in particular, results for 
Afghanistan are now included explicitly as an additional figure in the paper, 

(2) exhaustive statistical testing in order to check the validity of our empirical findings, 
(3) analysis of various extensions of the theoretical model in order to check its general 

validity, 

(4) thorough checking and revision of the datasets for Iraq and Colombia. 

The details are as follows: 

First, we have improved the Iraq data substantially in several important aspects: we created 

a new integrated Iraq dataset using multiple sources while avoiding double counting by 

matching events across sources; we have eliminated non-conflict events (criminal 

homicides) and composite events that are aggregates of many sub-events; we have added 

events on coalition casualties in Iraq.  These improvements deepen considerably the 

compatibility between our Iraq data and our Colombia data.  Second, we have improved our 

statistical approach significantly. In the Appendices, we present all of our algorithms, tests 

and statistical significance levels.  Interestingly, this switch to more novel and appropriate 

estimation techniques has not changed our results in any significant way.  Third, we have 

carried out numerous checks of the robustness of our empirical results and have considered 

many extensions of the mathematical model.  Fourth, as in the case of Iraq, we built a new 

integrated dataset for Afghanistan and successfully obtained a similar power law with an 

alpha parameter near 2.5 as predicted by our baseline model.   

 

 

 

61

Since our original submission, we have received comments on the following aspects of our 

work, to which we now respond: 

1) Iraq Body Count (IBC) data. Most of the entries in this database are discrete events.  But 

many of them are aggregations of events over stretches of time, sometimes over several 

weeks.  These entries largely break down into two different types.   

a)  There are estimates of the number of criminal homicides for a particular month in a 

particular location.  For each time and place IBC takes the number of violent deaths 

reported by a local morgue and subtracts the average number of pre-war monthly 

homicides and the number of violent deaths in discrete conflict events included in 

the IBC database for that time and place. The idea (which we confirmed via direct 

correspondence with IBC) is that the remainder consists of homicides not picked up 

by IBC as conflict events and which can be considered “excess deaths” linked to the 

invasion of Iraq.  In other words, these are viewed as part of a wave of criminal 

homicides unleashed by the coalition invasion.   

For two key reasons, we have purged all of these entries from the version of the 

dataset we work with in this paper.  First, these should be overwhelmingly criminal 

homicides, not part of the conflict per se.  In particular, such events are not included 

in the CERAC Colombia Conflict database so should not be part of the Iraq 

database for this paper.  Second, it is likely that most of the underlying events 

contributing to the IBC “morgue event” entries are single homicides, or perhaps two 

or three people killed in a single event.  Since our paper is specifically investigating 

62

 

 

 

the size distribution of violent events it is a distortion to add these up into single big 

events. 

b)  There are other entries that do reflect true conflict activity that are reported as 

aggregates of underlying events, due to the inability to monitor them on a blow-by-

blow basis.  Most of these are during the first six weeks of the war, March 20, 2003 

to April 30, 2003, when there was a huge aerial bombing campaign.  There are two 

other big composites covering two separate sieges of Falluja in April of 2004 and 

November of 2004.  These entries are measuring true conflict activity so we want 

them in our database in principle.  However, we must be cautious about the impact 

they can have on our power law estimation.  The discussion in the Appendices now 

treats these issues extensively.  Here are the main relevant points. 

i)  In the paper itself we exclude the first six weeks of the war since during this 

period the war had more of a conventional than a guerrilla character.  So the 

comparison with Colombia is more appropriate after May 1, 2003 than before.  

This decision has the consequence of purging almost all the remaining IBC 

entries that are aggregates of multiple underlying events.   

Nevertheless, in the robustness section of the supplementary materials we 

recalculate all are results using the full run of data from March 20, 2003.  Our 

results are robust to this extension with the estimated αcoming out a bit 

smaller. 

63

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ii)  The results in the paper do include the two Falluja entries.  However, in the 

Appendices we show that we can remove then with little impact on our results.   

 

In this exercise of checking the robustness of our findings, we also decided to 

remove a third big event in which many people were killed during a stampede. 

We have shown that this event can safely be eliminated without significantly 

changing our results. 

In addition, we have introduced further improvements to our Iraq data.  The IBC data 

measure only civilian casualties while the CERAC Colombia data covers both 

combatants and civilians.  To improve their comparability we used data posted on a 

web site, called iCasualties, to integrate coalition military casualties and contractor 

personnel casualties into our Iraq data.  This required major manual work to ensure that 

we had no double counting of events.  In the course of this work we also discovered a 

terrorism database, called ITERATE, with a list of Iraq events.  So we integrated all 

three of these.  We provide details of on our new dataset in the Appendices.  We believe 

that the Iraq and Colombia data is now highly compatible.   

 

Taking a devil’s advocate position, one might raise the possibility that the result that the 

value of the power-law exponent is approximately 2.5, is a coincidence.  Although we 

obviously cannot wait for a re-run of the Iraq or Colombia wars in order to check this, 

we have addressed this particular concern by building a new dataset for the recent 

64

conflict in Afghanistan.  This war is believed to have had a similar insurgent character 

to the Iraq and Colombia wars, and the data is comparable to our Iraq and Colombia 

data (see Appendices for a complete discussion of the database).  

Remarkably, we do indeed obtain a power law for Afghanistan with an αof almost 

exactly 2.5 (see Figure 4 in the paper).  In fact, we have now collected data for another 

four modern conflicts: Indonesia (separatist conflict), Israel-Palestine, Casamance (in 

Senegal) and Northern Ireland.  These all follow power laws with alphas ranging 

between 1.99 and 3.18, and hence produce an average of around 2.5. Indeed, it is again 

exactly 2.5 in the case of Indonesia.   

In order to investigate further the idea that modern guerilla-like wars are somewhat 

different from older and/or more conventional wars, we have obtained and analyzed 

data on three old wars: the civil wars of the US, Spain and Russia. We found no 

statistical evidence allowing us to distinguish their casualty distribution from another 

right-skewed, fat-tailed distribution such as a log-normal.  We also have analyzed data 

for the Rwandan genocide and for communal conflict in Indonesia and again we cannot 

discriminate between different distributions. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude 

from this extended study that the power-law behavior with an exponent of around 2.5 is 

indeed a rather reliable property of modern guerilla-like wars, and does not seem to 

extend well to other conflict settings.  

 

 

 

 

65

Correspondence with the terrorism data is not exact since this is terrorism data rather 

than conflict data as used for our Colombia, Iraq and Afghanistan work.  Nevertheless, 

the event is the basic unit of analysis for all four datasets.  We think that the fact that 

terrorism events do not correspond exactly to conflict events adds to the interest of our 

work since these two different processes turn out to yield very similar size distributions 

of violent events. 

2)  Fitting power laws 

All our results are now based on a maximum likelihood estimator that takes into 

account the discreteness of our data.  In fact, we did Monte Carlo simulations to 

compare the properties of this Discrete Maximum Likelihood (DML), with the standard 

maximum likelihood estimator for continuous data and the OLS estimator. As expected, 

the DML estimator turns out to be the best of the ones studied and thus is the one we 

employ in this new paper.  It yields both a lower Mean Square Error and lower bias than 

the other two estimators.  The small upward bias of the DML falls rapidly with sample 

size and it does not depend on

, the minimum value for which the power law holds. 

minx

Details on the DML and the other two estimators are provided in the Appendices. A 

very encouraging result of this exercise is that even after switching to this estimator, our 

main findings remain unchanged.  In particular the trends reported in the first version of 

the paper, also turn out to be valid under this change in estimators.    

66

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

We have also implemented tests for two important hypotheses: first, that the 

distribution of our data follows a power-law; and second, the hypothesis that it follows 

a lognormal distribution. We report the statistical significance of these tests.  In all three 

cases (Afghanistan, Colombia and Iraq) we found strong statistical evidence to reject 

the hypothesis of lognormality but cannot reject the hypothesis of power-law behavior.  

In addition, we estimate confidence intervals around our point estimates, both for the 

estimates with the pooled data (Figure 1) and for the picture with the rolling time 

windows (Figure 2).  We have carried out various statistical robustness checks on these, 

complete with confidence intervals and statistical significance (see the Appendices).  

3)  Mathematical Model 

We have carried out extensive analytical and numerical analysis of various 

generalizations of the model, including extensions to account for multiple armies. We 

have concluded that the basic result of a steady-state behavior with a power-law near 

2.5, is a remarkably robust one. Indeed, it seems to be somewhat of a universal result 

for coalescence-fragmentation models in which the connectivity between agents is not 

restricted by geometry (i.e. so-called high-dimensional models) and for a wide class of 

underlying mechanisms regarding the coalescence-fragmentation process. We are 

therefore confident about our claims of generality, and regard the result we show as 

more than just some kind of coincidence. In other words, we truly believe that the fact 

67

received: 

 

 

 

that the current trend of these guerilla-like wars is to have an exponent around 2.5, is 

because the current underlying mechanism driving these wars is that of coalescence-

In addition, we supply the following responses to specific criticisms that we have 

a)  “If an attack unit can be a person, an object or a piece of information, then some 

attack units can be composed completely of objects or information. But clearly, 

these units pose no threat to anyone without a person to use them in a real attack." 

Certainly people will typically be contained in an attack unit (or at least one person) 

in order for it to be able to attack. Having said this, an attack unit could one day be a 

person plus a timed explosive device -- then the next day, the person leaves the 

device by itself (i.e. this attack unit of person-plus-device fragments to give one unit 

of one person and one unit of a device). The device then detonates itself after say 12 

hours. So in the moment of attack, the device has no people in its attack unit. 

Indeed, in Figure 3, the dark shapes are not meant to represent insurgent fighters 

themselves, but rather are the potential casualties in an attack by that attack unit. 

More generally, we stress that our aim is not to model all the precise details of such 

a conflict. Instead, the mathematical model is designed to deal with average 

quantities in very general way. In short, it is meant to be a 'minimal model'. Indeed, 

this is actually a positive aspect of the model, since without needing to specify the 

 

68

detailed contents of the insurgent force, we have obtained good agreement with the 

observed data merely by invoking a continual process of fragmentation-coalescence. 

Hence we have managed to identify this process of fragmentation-coalescence as a 

possible universal driving feature of modern insurgent warfare. 

b)  “Not every unit with strength S can be decomposed into S units of strength one. For 

example, a hand gun's strength is not decomposable. Indeed, only if the basic unit of 

attack is a person do the proposed mechanics of fragmenting and coalescing make 

any sense. Thus, an attack unit's strength is proportional to the number of people in 

it, which is only the case if all guerillas have the same information and weapons, 

and are basically interchangeable." 

We agree that a handgun's strength may not be decomposable, although of course 

the bullets would be. (One bullet can only kill one person, and a handgun without 

bullets has no attack strength). In addition, explosives are again decomposable into 

smaller units. Having said this, we again stress that we cannot model all the details 

of such a conflict. Instead, the mathematical model is designed to deal with average 

quantities in a 'minimal model' way. Future work will look at the possibility of 

resupplying the insurgent army, or this army having a fixed initial attack strength 

which degrades with time. However for the present model, we assume that the total 

attack strength is maintained around a value N on average, or at least that it changes 

slowly in time on the scale of the fragmentation-coalescence process. Either of these 

assumptions will be sufficient for the mathematical results of the model to hold.

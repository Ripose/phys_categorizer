In order to measure the radial displacements of facets on surface of a growing spherical 

Cu2-

δSe crystal with sub-nanometer resolution, we have investigated the reliability and 

accuracy  of  standard  method  of  Fourier  analysis  of  fringes  obtained  applying  digital 

laser interferometry method. Guided by the realistic experimental parameters (density 

and orientation of fringes), starting from 2-dimensional model interferograms and using 

unconventional custom designed Gaussian filtering window and unwrapping procedure 

of the retrieved phase, we have demonstrated that for considerable portion of parameter 

space  the  non-negligible  inherent  phase  retrieval  error  is  present  solely  due  to  non-

integer number of fringes within the digitally recorded image (using CCD camera). Our 

results  indicate  the  range  of  experimentally  adjustable  parameters  for  which  the 

generated error is acceptably small. We also introduce a modification of the (last part) 

of the usual phase retrieval algorithm which significantly reduces the error in the case 

of small fringe density.

Introduction 

Investigations  by  Ohachi's  group1,2,3  and  our  investigations4,5,6  of  superionic 

conductors,  copper  and  silver  chalcogenides,  materials  with  high  diffusivity  of  Cu  and  Ag 

atoms, enabled their promotion as new members of rather small group of materials that form 

equilibrium  crystal  shape  (ECS),  being  the  only  ones  that,  besides  4He  form  ECS  of 

macroscopic size (spherical faceted crystals of several mm in diameter). The size is crucial 

for investigating the non-equilibrium processes, i.e. shape kinetics during crystal growth as a 

function of the supersaturation forces driving the growth. Apart from thermodynamic reasons 

(approaching the limit of infinite size crystal), the size is specially important in the case of 

crystals  growing  at  high  temperatures  at  which  the  STM  and  AFM  techniques  are  not 

applicable.  Using  two-beam  optical  interferometry  (at  growth  velocities  from  0.01  nm/s  to 

few tens of nm/s, with declared resolution well below 10 nm) and by monitoring pressure of 

the liquid as a level gauge (0.05 to 50 

m/s) for investigating growth of 4He crystals at 2-250 

μ

mK, new facet growth modes were detected7 the mechanism of which is not quite understood. 

On the other hand, our preliminary studies show that copper selenide ECS crystals at around 

800  K  exhibit  similar  facet  growth  modes.  For 

their  modeling 

the 

temperature 

complementarity  of  4He  and  superionic  conductors  crystals  seems  to  be  of  essential 

importance.  

Our goal is to measure as precisely as possible the values of geometrical parameters 

of  flat  (facets)  and curved parts of  growing  crystal  surface necessary  for  characterizing the 

growth  kinetics  of  our  spherical  apparently  equilibrium  single  crystals  in  order  to  better 

understand the observed modes of growth, in particular the vertical and lateral facet growth. 

Using  the  flat  and  probably  atomically  smooth  well  developed  facets  on  the  surface  of 

growing  spherical  crystal  as  highly  reflecting  objects,  we  apply  digital  laser  interferometry

method  with  refined8  Fourier  transform  method  of  fringe  pattern  analysis  to  measure  the 

displacements of facet perpendicular to the facet plane with sub-nanometer resolution. 

In order to test the reliability and accuracy of the standard procedure of phase retrieval 

from the interference fringe pattern7,8,9,10 by using the usual fringe Fourier analysis method, 

we  have  started11  by  testing  the  method  itself  applying  it  to  an  artificial,  idealized  fringe 

pattern in simple case where the 2-dimensional (2D) fringe pattern can be reduced to its 1-

dimensional (1D) projection (where the x axis is set to be perpendicular to the interferometric 

fringes). The method used as described in work of Kostianovski et al.9 revealed the error in 

retrieved phase compared to the initially imposed phase in the model pattern. This inherent 

error was shown to originate from the non-integer number of fringes in the image field, and 

its dependence on spatial carrier frequency, initial phase setting and the deviation of number 

of fringes from integer value was investigated. We suggested a modification of (the last part 

of)  the  usual  algorithm  (applied  after  removal  of  carrier  frequency  from  the  fringe  pattern 

Fourier  spectrum  and  filtering  it  with  an  appropriately  designed  form  of  Gaussian  filtering 

window) in order to reduce this error. The adapted algorithm was shown to have reduced the 

retrieved  phase  error  more  than  threefold,  specially  for  low  wave  vector  values  or  small 

number of interferometric fringes within the observed image field. 

Since  under  the  usual  experimental  conditions  it  is  extremely  rare  that  the  fringe 

pattern  is  obtained  which  can  be  treated  within  the  1D  formalism  already  presented,  we 

outline  here  the  modifications  necessary  for  treatment  of  more  realistic  general  2D  case, 

showing the appropriate changes in design of the Gaussian filtering window and giving the 

explicit  formulas  for  application  in  the  real-life  experimental  situation  which  are  shown  to 

reduce  the  inherent  phase  determination  errors.  Their  dependence  on  the  parameters  of 

experimentally obtained interferometric fringe patterns is clearly demonstrated.

Fringe-pattern Fourier analysis 

Interferometric Images 

During  the  crystal  growth  experiment  as  a  rule  we  acquire  a  large  number  of  2D 

fringe  patterns  using  a  CCD camera. It takes  pictures  (frames)  at regular time  intervals  (25 

frames  per  second)  of  the  part  of  growing  crystal  surface,  including  the  facet  with 

interference  fringes,  having  generally  elliptical  shape  (since  the  incident  beam  does  not 

coincide with the normal to the facet). The background noise is automatically reduced by two 

orders  of  magnitude  applying  an  original  algorithm8,  the  elliptical  area  with  fringe  pattern 

corresponding to the facet is detected and a square part of 64 x 64 pixels in size containing 

the interference fringes is taken from the facet area for further analysis. These interferograms 

(fringe patterns) are then used for extraction of the phase field value equivalent to changes in 

height of the corresponding facet area upon which the object interference beam is reflected.  

A  fringe  pattern  is,  as described earlier11  a  set  of  straight parallel  fringes  with  their 

(cid:0)
intensity  field  ( )ri

(cid:0)
  within  2D  image  modulated  along  wave  vector  Q

,  the  magnitude  and 

direction  of  which  are  determined  by  the  experimental  setup  (adjustable  position  of  the 

reference mirror of the interferometer):

We  again  have  three  separate  terms,  corresponding  to  the  first  negative  maximum,  central

(cid:0)
QD

(

. For a non-integer number of fringes (

Fourier Spectrum Shift and Removal of Carrier Frequency 

Following  the  usual  procedure,  in  order  to  retrieve  the  phase  of  the  interference 

signal, we now shift the Fourier spectrum in such a way that one of the side maxima is moved 

to the position 

, thus removing the carrier frequency.

As we are dealing with discrete signal in the first place (intensities of pixels), the shift 

(cid:0)
of  the  spectrum  can  be  done  exclusively  by  an  integer  number  Qk

Filtering using the 2-dimensional Gaussian Window  

In order to extract the phase information from the spectrum, the standard procedure is 

to  isolate  the  shifted  former  first  positive  maximum  from  the  rest  of  the  spectrum.  This  is 

done  by  filtering  of  the  Fourier  spectrum    by  a  narrow  rectangular  window  centered  at the 

origin  (

)  and  apodized  by  a  suitable  Gaussian  function,  as  suggested  before7,9,11.  The 

(cid:0)
0=k

custom  designed  filtering  function  is  centered  at  the  origin  of  reciprocal  space,  again 

including  the  concept  of  the  adjustable  width  depending  on  separation  (positions)  of  first-

order maxima relative to the origin and the edges of the Fourier space11. Its role is to reduce 

the intensity of the former central maximum (now shifted to 

) as well as the former first 

negative  maximum  (now  shifted  to 

).  It  is  also,  in  analogy  with  the  1D  case  used  to

remove the intensity jumps formerly located at the Nyquist frequencies (the edges of the field

contribution in the spectrum coming from the former first negative maximum as well, which 

was completely neglected in previous work9. 

Following the standard  recipe, just  like in the  1D case11, the next step  would  be the

Results and discussion 

As discussed for the case in which the phase field was reduced to 1D representation11, 

the  main  disadvantage  of  the  method  is  the  x-y  resolution  problem  originating  from  the 

artificial retrieved phase field modulation introduced inevitably from the incomplete shift (by 

the integer valued vector) of the first positive maximum of the Fourier spectrum towards the 

origin,  thus  being  left 

  off  center.  In  order  to  determine  the  retrieved  phase  error  as 

(cid:0)
QD

compared with the initially introduced phase, we are once again forced to do the averaging 

over the entire retrieved phase field.  

11

 

 

In  the  real  experimental  data  the  non-integer 

  changes  from  one  image  to  the 

(cid:0)
QD

next8, so that its influences on the retrieved phase field modulation do not cancel out when 

calculating  the  changes  in  the  phase  field  between  consecutive  images.  Therefore,  it  is  not 

possible  to  obtain  the  reconstruction  of  fine  details  of  the  growing  crystal  facet  –  the  only 

reliable  information  one  can  get  is  about  the  change  of  position  of  the  growing  facet 

calculated from averaged phase field over the entire N x M (typically 64 x 64 pixels) selected 

fringe  pattern  area.  Taking  these  regions  from  different  parts  of  the  facet  image  can  give 

some local information about the surface profile changes, the x-y resolution being given by 

the  size  of  the  crystal  surface  corresponding  to  the  selected  region  (depending  on  the 

magnification of the experimental setup).  

Before  averaging,  because  of  these  same  artificial  modulations,  the  appropriate  2D 

unwrapping  must  be  applied.  Fortunately, 

the  simple  methods  found  in  standard 

mathematical  software  prove  to  be  quite  appropriate  (but  should  be  applied  with  care,  

consecutively  first  to  columns,  then  to  rows  of  the  matrix),  except  in  few  rare  occasions 

where the previous application of an "initial preparatory" unwrapping following the algorithm 

by Abbas12 helps to remove some problematic phase jumps. 

The  difference  of  thus  retrieved  phase  (by  evaluating  Eq.  (12),  averaged  over  the 
(cid:0)
phase field, taking the maximum possible non-integer part of the spatial carrier frequency  Q

 

(

  and 

5.0=y

)) and the  initially  given phase 

φ   (in  Eq.  (1)) is equal to  the one

5.0=ab

), as it 

α

should  be.  The dependence  of the error  magnitude on initially set phase and on  the  integer 

(cid:0)
part of the spatial carrier frequency  Qk

 for these parameters shows maximum value for the 

input  phase 

φ   =  ±0.155,  being  equivalent  to  10  nm  frontal  displacement  ( zΔ

which  is  completely  analogous  to  the  previously  given11  expression  for  the  1D  case.  This 

introduces some more computational effort as compared to standard (less accurate expression 

(12)), but the improvement is obvious from the Fig. 3, where the phase values obtained from 

this  expressions  are  shown  with  smaller  grey  circles.  The  error  is  still  existing,  and  is 

 

14

dependent  on  non-integer  carrier  frequency  (no  error  for

significantly  reduced.  It  can  be  further  suppressed  by  increasing  the  value  of  α  in  the 

Gaussian  window  definition  (taking  care  that  it  still  makes  sense,  concerning  the  noise 

present  in  realistic  experiments  –  the  removal  of  noise  from  original  data8  is  an  obligatory 

prerequisite for high quality measurements). 

In  analogy  with  Fig.  2,  the  dependence  of  the  retrieved  phase  error  using  this 

corrected  expression  given  by  Eq.  (19)  on  integer  part  components  of  the  spatial  carrier 

frequency 

Qk  and 

Qk  is shown in Fig. 4 (again for the worst possible case of 

x

y

φ  = 0.155, and 

in

for the maximum values 

5.0=x

QD

 and 

5.0=y

QD

). 

In  order  to  emphasize  the  significance  of  the  improved  (corrected)  expression  for 

phase  retrieval  and  to  demonstrate  its  meaning  in  real  experimental  situations,  we  show  in 

Fig. 5. two cross-sections of combined Figs. 2. and 4. In the upper part we show the behavior 

of retrieved phase error in the case of interferometric fringes exactly parallel to the image x-

axis  (

0=y

Qk

),  while  in  the  lower  part  we  show  the  error  in  the  case  of  fringes  running 

diagonally over the image field (

). The error of the retrieved phase (averaged over the 

k =

x
Q

k

y
Q

whole  field)  is  shown  in  nanometers  –  it  is  in  fact  the  error  in  determination  of  the 

displacement of the growing facet in the direction perpendicular to its plane (for 

 = 632.8 nm 

λ

for  He-Ne  laser,  the  angle  between  the  incident  and  the  reflected  beam  of  00).  Diamonds 

show  the  error  obtained  using  the  standard  Eq.  (12),  and  squares  the  corrected  value 

according to Eq. (19). The size of the errors is clearly suppressed several times by using the 

corrected  expression,  specially  for  the  small  density  of  fringes  within  the  image  field.  The 

error itself is obviously smaller for fringes running diagonally, and is almost negligible in any 

case for not too small and not too big density of fringes. (The insets show the enlarged view 

of the interval of 

Qk  values between 6 and 26, where the error is smaller than ±0.35 nm for 

x

 

15

horizontal fringes, and another order of magnitude smaller for diagonal fringes, 

k =

x
Q

k

y
Q

. In 

our case, growth of a single atom layer on the (111) facet of Cu2-xSe is equal to displacement 

of 0.35 nm.) As these parameters (number and orientation of fringes) can be adjusted by fine 

tuning  the  elements  of  the  experimental  setup,  these  conclusions  can  be  considered  as 

guidelines for performing more reliable and accurate measurements. 

Conclusions 

Striving  to  measure  as  precisely  as  possible  the  values  of  radial  displacements  of 

facets  on  the  surface  of  growing  spherical  single  crystals  of  Cu2-

δSe  using  digital  laser 

interferometry  method,  we  have  undertaken  to  test  the  reliability  and  accuracy  of  standard 

Fourier  analysis  procedure  for  phase  retrieval  from  interference  fringe  patterns.  Building 

upon  our  previous  work  on  idealized  fringe  pattern  which  can  be  reduced  to  its  1D 

projection11,  we  extended  our  study  to  more  realistic,  quite  general  2D  case  of  digitally 

recorded  interferograms,  investigating  wide  range  of  experimentally  adjustable  parameters 

(fringe density and orientation) on a model interferogram. We demonstrated the existence of 

inherent  errors  in  the  retrieved  phase  due  exclusively  to  the  non-integer  number  of 

interferometric  fringes  within  the  observed  digitally  sampled  image  obtained  from  a  CCD 

camera. Within the framework of the usual procedure (Fourier fringe analysis) for retrieving 

the  phase  value,  we  introduced  fully  adjustable  custom  designed  2D  Gaussian  filtering 

window.  The  appropriate  2D  unwrapping  of  the  retrieved  phase  field  is  applied  as 

consecutive multiple-stage unwrapping algorithm. The obtained phase field must be averaged 

over  the entire selected  interferogram area. Comparing  the  retrieved  phase  with the  initially 

set  one,  we  showed  the  dependence of  the  retrieved  phase  errors  on  the  input  phase  value, 

fringe  density and  orientation (for  generally  non-integer  2D spatial  carrier frequencies).  We 

 

 

16

presented  a  modified  expression  to  replace  the  one  usually  used  for  phase  retrieval,  which 

results  in  significant  reduction  of  the  error  amplitude,  particularly  for  small  fringe  density 

values. Our results show that there is a range of experimentally selectable parameters within 

which the retrieved phase error, expressed as corresponding observed facet displacement, is 

smaller than ±0.35 nm in the case of interferometric fringes running parallel to x-axis of the 

interferogram, and even smaller than ±0.035 nm in the case of diagonally oriented fringes.

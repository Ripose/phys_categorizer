Abstract 
This paper is devoted to show the advantages of  introducing a geometric viewpoint and a non extensive 
formulation in the description of apparently unrelated phenomena: combustion and earthquakes. Here, it 
is shown how the introduction of  a fragmentation analysis based on that formulation  leads to find a 
common point for description of these phenomena 
 

I. - Introduction. 
Fragmentation is present in a plethora of natural phenomena, generally accompanying industrial, 
geological or other processes.  
Fragmentation is responsible for the distribution of fragment sizes that appear on rocks, soils, asteroids 
and many other objects. Besides, its importance in biological and technological processes in evident. 
This is the reason for the interest of many researchers to find fragment size distribution functions (fsdf) 
able to fit with the distributions observed in nature. 
Due to the enormous difficulties involved in the task of modeling fragmentation and fracture with the 
laws of mechanics, the search for a formulation in this way has been an insurmountable task. 
Nevertheless, some theoretical and experimental researches have been carried out by alternative ways. 
Two of them can be named as "fractal formulations" (ff) [1] and "maximum entropy methods" (MEM) 
[2], demonstrating with their results that the methods of fractal geometry and of probability theory, 
together with the introduction of a new way of looking to this phenomenon, give very good and 
promising results. 
Some statistical distributions have been proposed to fit the fsdf in a wide variety of fragmentation 
phenomena. Among them, it is worth to mention: 
a)  Weibull distribution. The cumulative number of fragments of characteristic size smaller than r can 

be fitted with:

where α and σare constants.

circumstances, be described as:

This distribution is of particular importance since it expresses the lack of any characteristic scale 

 
. 
in the distribution, i.e., the smaller the fragments, the more abundant are they. The distribution has no 
local maximum or mean value. This has been reported in the distribution of moon craters, ice fields, 
islands (Korčak´s law) and many other. This is precisely the distribution that has been obtained with 
fractal models (See [1]). Besides. Pareto is a common behavior of a whole family of distribution 
functions known as "Levy distributions" whose role in physics is becoming fundamental and  
 merit by itself a separate paper, since this family accomplishes the property that the behavior of a part ( 
In distribution, of course) is similar to that of the whole. This is a  fractal property! Enough to say that 
many of the distribution functions used to describe fragments have Pareto as asymptotic limit. 
In this article we present the theoretical and experimental results of our group in the study of fsdf in a 
variety of situations. Section I is devoted to the field of combustion and section II presents an attempt to 
apply this study in the field of earthquakes. 
 
 
 

II. Fragments and combustion 
Though combustion engineers have been addict to Rossin Ramler distributions for the description of 
spray drops, experiments performed by our group demonstrated that the fsdf in the case of drop breaking  
Follows a power law. In figure 1 the experimental setup is shown

Fig. 1. Experimental setup for the fragmentation of drops: 
1-transparent sheet to collect fragments, 2- oil drop. 3,4 capillaries. 

The goal of the experiment was to measure fsdf of drops suffering of microexplosions, i.e., an explosive 
process produced in the combustion chamber when the fuel drops are emulsioned with water. Water-fuel 
emulsions have been used to improve the efficiency of combustion since microexplosions lead to a 
secondary atomization and to a larger area of interaction between fuel and oxygen during combustion. As 
we said, the fsdf was tested to be power law, especially when the applied pressure was high. But for 
lower pressures, the distribution resulted to be well fitted with a lognormal distribution. In this case a 
Rossin-Ramler distribution can also be used. The transition from lognormal to Pareto (For details, see 
[3,4]) coincides with the results reported in [5,6]. 
Indeed, in [5] an experiment is reported where long thin glass rods are dropped from different heights. 
The resulting fragments were collected ands, as the falling height increased, the fsdf transitioned from a 
lognormal type distribution to a Pareto. Some kind of  “phase transition” was observed. The same 
situation was presented in [6] where the same experiment was performed but with falling mercury drops. 
There, a representation of fragmentation in the form of a Bethe lattice percolation process was proposed 
which reveals a transition from a lognormal type to a Pareto distribution in the fsdf, but the model is out 
of the scope of this paper. We refer the reader to [6].    
It is worth to say that in the case of Pareto distribution of fuel drops, the results of the combustion are 
x →  in Eq. 4, the 
strongly dependent of the critical exponent in Eq. 4. In [3] it was shown that when 
quantity of unburned matter decreases rapidly, to behave as a “perfect” combustion, with zero waste of 
fuel. As it was shown in [1], this corresponds to a completely self-similar distribution of drops, i.e., 
complete self-similarity irrespective of the scale changes made to observe the drops.  
Other groups (See [2,7]) have attempted to derive the fsdf from the maximum entropy principle subject 
to some constraints which mainly came from physical considerations about the fragmentation 
phenomena> The resulting fragment distribution function describes the distribution of sizes of the 
fragments in a regime in which scaling is not present. 
As scaling invariably occurs when the energy of the fragmentation is high, this suggests that the analysis 
is only applicable to low energies. However, the maximum entropy principle is universal and has an 
almost unlimited range of application. Consequently we would expect to be able to use it to describe the 
transition to scaling as the energy of the fragmentation grows. 
The expression for the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy  S  in its Shannon form is

ip  is the probability of finding the system in the microscopic state  i ,  k is Boltzmann’s constant, 

 
where 
and W is the total number of microstates. 
This has been shown to be restricted to  the domain of validity of Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics. This 
statistics describes Nature when the effective microscopic interactions and the microscopic memory are 
short ranged [8]. The process of violent fractioning, like  that of  droplet microexplosions in combustion 
chambers, blasting and shock fragmentation with high energies, etc, leads to the existence of long-range 
interactions between all parts of the object being fragmented. 
Fractioning is a paradigm of non extensivity, since the fractioning object can be considered as a 
collection of parts which, after division, have an entropy larger than that of their union, i.e., if we denote 
by 

iA  the parts or fragments in which the object has been divided, its entropy  S  obeys

necessary to use non- extensive statistics, instead of the BG statistics. This kind of theory has already 
been proposed by Tsallis [9], who postulated a generalized form of entropy, given by

i.e., the normalization condition. The other condition we impose is mass conservation. But as the system 
is finite, this condition will lead to a very sharp decay in the asymptotic behavior of the dsdf for large 
sizes of the fragments. Consequently, we will impose a more general condition, like the “q-conservation” 
of the mass, in the form:

which is  the well-known Rossin-Ramler distribution. 
 
Then, with this formulation the behavior of fragments in the process of  breaking is reproduced. Thus we 
confirm that BG statistics cannot be applied to all fragmentation regimes and Tsallis  entropy can be used 
to describe the transition to scaling. In this respect, the parameter , which determines the “degree of non 
extensivity”  of the statistics, ca be related  to  an effective temperature of breakage. 

II. –Fragments and earthquakes 
The  Gutenberg-Richter  law  has  motivated  a  mass  of  research.  This  is  due  to  the  importance  of  the 
knowledge  of  the  energy  distribution  of  earthquakes and its  physical and practical  implications.  Some 
famous  models  like  those  of  Burridge  and  Knopoff  [10]  or  Olami  et  al  [11]  have  focused  in  the 
mechanical  phenomenology  of  earthquakes  through  simples  images  which  capture  essentials  of  the 
nature and genesis of a seism: the relative displacement of tectonic plates or the relative motion of the 
hanging wall and footwall on a fault and also the existence of a threshold for a catastrophic release of 
energy in the system. The irregular geometry of the profiles of the tectonic plates and fault planes was 
highlighted, for example, in De Rubeis et al [12] using a geometric viewpoint to deduce the power law 
dependence  of  earthquake  energy  distribution  with  good  results.  The  importance  of  a  geometric 
viewpoint  for  this  phenomenon  has  been  also  highlighted  in  Herrmann  et  al  [13],  where  an  idealized 
representation of the fragmented core of a fault (gouge) was presented. Today it is widely accepted that 
most  earthquakes  are  originated  by  relative  motion  of  fault  planes,  whereas  the  images  to  model  this 
energy release are diverse. The standard earthquake picture usually assigns the cause of an earthquake to 
some kind of rupture or some stick-slip mechanism in which the friction properties of the fault play the 
determinant  role.  A  review  of  these  viewpoints  and  some  generated  paradoxes  can  be  found  in  [14].  
Herrmann et al (1990) idealized the gouge to be a medium formed by circular disk-shaped pieces filling 
the  space  between  two  planes  acting  like  bearings.  Here,  we  present  a  more  realistic  approximation, 
considering  that  the  surfaces  of  the  tectonic  plates  are  irregular  and  the  space  between  them  contains 
fragments of very diverse shape.  
          
 
The  abundance  of  models  that  manifest  the  catastrophic  mechanical  nature  of  earthquakes  is  expected 
since the mechanism of earthquake triggering, although not well known, reveals itself as a catastrophic 

one. The irregularity of the profiles of the tectonic plates and fault planes has been pointed out as a main 
cause of earthquakes and in  [12] the Gutenberg-Richter law for large earthquakes was obtained on the 
basis of assuming a Brownian shape of the profiles and the hypothesis that energy release is proportional 
to the overlap interval between profiles. In other models [13]  the material between the fault planes is 
considered. Nevertheless, the irregularities of the fault planes can be combined with the distribution of 
fragments between them to develop a mechanism of triggering earthquakes, which can be essentially the 
same as in [13] owing to the irregular shape of the profiles and fragments. 
 
Let us start from the situation illustrated in the figure 2: two irregular profiles (no predetermined shape is 
assumed)  are  able  to  slip  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Stress  in  the  structure  accumulates  until  one  of  the 
asperities is broken. Then, the slip occurs. In the other hand, we can considerer the phenomena in a small 
scale, that is, we are showing now the details of the gouge that can produce small earthquakes (figure 3). 
The motion can be hindered not only by the overlapping of two irregularities of the profiles, but also by 
the eventual relative position of several fragments as illustrated in the figure between the points “a” and 
“b”. Stress in the resulting structure accumulates until a displacement of one of the asperities or even its 
breakage  in  the  point  of  contact  with  the  gouge  fragment  leads  to  a  relative  displacement  of  the  fault 
planes  of  the  order  of  the  size  of  the  hindering  fragment  “r”.  Then,  the  eventual  release  of  stress, 
whatever be the cause, leads to such a displacement with the subsequent liberation of energy. We assume 
this energy “ε” to be proportional to “r”, so that the size distribution of the fragments in the gouge can 
reflect the energy distribution of earthquakes generated by this mechanism.

Fig3. – Profiles interacting through fragments 

 
 
 
 
As already pointed out, the size distribution function of fragments between the fault planes should reflect 
the energy distribution function of the earthquakes. We can assume that the constant interaction and local 
breakage of the fault planes produce the fragments. The process of fault slip can be considered to occur 
in a homogeneous fashion in all the deep of the fault so that in any plane transverse to the depth of the 
fault the situation is the same. To deduce the size distribution function of the fragments we consider a 
two-dimensional frame as the one illustrated in figure 2 or 3. Then, our problem is to find the distribution 
of fragments by area.  
As  fractioning  is  a  paradigm  of  non-extensivity,  it  may  be  necessary  to  use  non-extensive  statistics 
instead of the Boltzmann-Gibbs one to describe the size distribution function of the fragments. As in the 
previous section, we will apply the maximum entropy principle for the Tsallis entropy.  
The Tsallis entropy for our problem has the form:

(16) 

 
 
where  p(σ)  is  the  probability  of  finding  a  fragment  of  relative  surface  σ  referred  to  a  characteristic 
surface of the system, and q is a real number. k is Boltzmann’s constant. It is easy to see that this entropy 
reduces  to  the  Boltzmann’s  one  when  q →  1.  The  sum  by  all  states  in  the  entropy  is  here  expressed 
through  the  integration  in  all  sizes  of  the  fragments  up  to  the  largest  surface  Σ  of  the  collection  of 
fragments.  As  we  already  know,  the  Tsallis  formulation  involves  the  introduction  of  at  least  two 
constraints. The first one is the normalization of p(σ):  

 

 
and the other is the “ad hoc” condition about the q-mean value, which in our case can be expressed as:

This condition reduces to the definition of the mean value when q → 1. More information concerning the 
constraints that can be imposed in the formulation can be seen in [8]. As we already said, fracture is a 

paradigm of such long-range interaction phenomenon, then the problem is to find the extremum of 

 

subject to the conditions given by formulas 15 and 16. To simplify we will assume <<σ>>q = 1 (we will 
see that this has no effect in the final result). We define the lagrangian function  Γ to be:

If we now introduce the proportionality of the released relative energy ε with the linear dimension r of

which seems justified. A similar treatment can be performed with Boltzmann’s entropy.

Test for small earthquakes 
 
The Andalusian Institute of Geophysics and Seismic Disaster Prevention compiled the earthquake 
catalogue used in this study. The earthquakes were observed by the Andalusian Seismic Network of the 
Andalusian Institute of Geophysics and Seismic Disaster Prevention that consists of more than 20 
observational stations [15]. The analyzed area is the rectangular region between 35º and 38º North 
Latitude and between 0º and 5º West Longitude, hereinafter called the South of the Iberian Peninsula 
region. The epicenters of the earthquakes of the South of the Iberian Peninsula region are registered in a 
catalogue of more than 20000 events. Error of the hypocenters’ location in the x, y and z directions are 
more or less ±1 km, ±1 km and ±2 km, respectively . The seismicity during the period from 1985 to 2000 
may be considered normal, i.e., without major seismic events. The Gutenberg-Richter relation is satisfied 

in this data set, for earthquakes with magnitude greater than 2.5. The data is assumed to be free of 
observational bias and abnormal seismicity. Boltzmann’s fit and Gutenberg-Richter's fit are in figure 4 
and Tsallis's fit is in figure5. The assumptions applied to the Boltzmann formulation does not work for 
earthquakes of large magnitude. The frequency of event occurrence is a log-linear function for the range 
of magnitude between 2.5 and 5; this is the Gutenberg-Richter law and, as we expected, works correctly 
for moderate seismicity in the region. Finally, Tsallis's fit reflect that our assumptions for the gouge 
earthquakes are correct because the curve fits very well for seismicity ranging from 0 to 2.5 magnitude 
and also for higher magnitude Tsallis expression gives a good fitting for all the magnitude values. The 
obtained q value has a value equal to 1,645 with a correlation factor equal to 0,998.

Test for large earthquakes 
 
Lomnitz  and  Lomnitz    have  proposed  a  stochastic  model  of  strain  accumulation  and  release  at  plate 
boundaries  [16]  .  The  model  leads  to  a  generalized  Gutenberg-Richter  relation  in  terms  of  G(m)  the 
cumulative excedence of a magnitude m. The relation tends to the original Gutenberg-Richter relation in 
the  low  magnitude  range  and  at  high  magnitudes  it  provides  estimates  of  the  probability  occurrence 
which  are  significantly  more  realistic  than  the  Gutenberg-Richter  law.  They  have  obtained  excellent 
agreement with the data of the Chinese earthquake catalogue covering a time period of 2753 years. This 
catalogue contains the earthquakes for a threshold magnitude m = 6.0; it is the longest published catalog 
of historical earthquakes in any region. Lomnitz and Lomnitz (1979) excedence define like:

As we can observe, in this case q = 1,688 and the correlation factor is 0.994.

Results for a whole catalogue 
 
Two  different  catalogues  are  used  in  this  section.  First,  a  large  catalogue  from  the  United  States 
Geological Survey. The catalogue includes all the earthquakes in the California area, that is, all the San 
Andreas  fault  systems;  the  temporal  period  is  from  1990  to  actuality.  More  than  500000  earthquakes 
were  processed  and  the  results  are  in  FIGURE  7.  As  we  can  see,  Tsallis  formulation  can  fit  all  the 
earthquakes in the catalogue. The value of q is 1,676 and the correlation factor is 0.999. The second large 
catalogue is from the Geographic National Institute (Spain) and it has all the seismic data in the Iberian 
Peninsula (Spain). More than 10000 earthquakes are collected between 1970 to actuality. The results are 
shown  in  the  FIGURE  8.  Tsallis  formulation  can  fit  also  this  data;  the  results  are  q  =  1,663  and  the 
correlation factor 0,999.

Conclusions 
Fragments and fragmentation processes are present in  an enormous amount of  natural processes, and 
frequently this aspect does not receive adequate attention. With the reviewed examples we try to 
highlight two main aspects to take into account in the science of complex phenomena: One is that 
frequently a simple geometrical viewpoint is able to clarify problems that are intractable by other 
methods. So, fractal geometry and the theory of Levy distributions are called to play an important role in 

the physics of complex phenomena.  The second aspect is the importance of a generalization of many 
concepts originated in the statistical physics of equilibrium systems, better to say the "orthodox" 
statistical physics; This generalization is a promising way to get a formulation of many problems that, up 
to now, have been poorly studied due to the inadequacy of current methods. In this paper, with the results  
shown in fragmentation and earthquakes, Tsallis entropy showed to be a promising tool to start in this 
way

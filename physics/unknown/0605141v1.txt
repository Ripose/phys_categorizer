A stable optical resonator has been built using a 30 μm-wide, metal-coated microcantilever 

as  one  mirror.  The  second  mirror  was  a  12.7  mm-diameter  concave  dielectric  mirror.  By 

positioning  the  two  mirrors  75  mm  apart  in  a  near-hemispherical  configuration,  a  Fabry-Perot 

cavity with a finesse equal to 55 was achieved. The finesse was limited by the optical loss in the 

cantilever’s metal coating; diffraction losses from  the  small  mirror  were  negligible.  The  cavity 

achieved passive laser cooling of the cantilever’s Brownian motion.

The coupling of micromechanical structures to light via radiation pressure has been a topic of 

considerable  interest  in  recent  years.  Much  of  this  interest  has  been  driven  by  the  goal  of 

observing and exploiting quantum aspects of either the radiation pressure or the micromechanical 
structures themselves. Applications to quantum-limited detectors,1,2 the generation of squeezed3 
and entangled4 light, and macroscopic quantum phenomena5 have been proposed. Many of these 

goals require a high-finesse optical cavity in which one mirror is mounted on a micromechanical 

structure  such  as  a  cantilever.  Realizing  such  a  cavity  is  challenging  because  the  cantilever 

mirror  should  be  quite  small  (~10’s  of  μm)  and  this  small  size  may  lead  to  diffraction  losses 

which will degrade the optical cavity’s finesse. 

Here we describe the construction and characterization of a Fabry-Perot cavity in which one 

mirror  is  formed  by  a  commercial  atomic  force  microscope  cantilever.  The  second  mirror  is 

concave and forms a stable optical resonator with the cantilever. This is in contrast to previous 

experiments  which  have  either  used  two  planar  mirrors  (leading  to  an  unstable  cavity  and  low 
finesse)6,7 or substantially larger (mm-scale) cantilevers.1,8  

The  two  mirrors  are  arranged  in  a  near-hemispherical  geometry  in  order  to  support  cavity 

modes with the smallest possible waist at the cantilever. We mode-match a stable cw laser to this 

cavity and predominantly excite a single transverse and longitudinal mode, which we measure to 

have a finesse F = 55. This value is consistent with the independently measured reflectivites of 

the  two  mirrors  forming  the  cavity,  indicating  that  diffraction  loss  from  the  small  cantilever 

mirror does not limit F. In addition, we find that the nonadiabatic response of the cantilever to 

the  light  in  the  cavity  leads  to  passive  laser  cooling  of  the  cantilever’s  Brownian  motion  by 

roughly a factor of six. 

The cavity is shown schematically in Fig. 1. It is formed by a microcantilever and a concave 

dielectric mirror. The cantilever is a commercial AFM cantilever (Olympus AC240TM), 240 μm 

long, 30 μm wide, and 2.7 μm thick. The cantilever is made of Si. The surface of the cantilever 

facing the input coupler is coated with Al, while the opposite surface is coated with Pt. It has a 

measured resonance frequency in its lowest flexural mode of ν0 = 67,110 Hz, and is specified to 

have a spring constant k = 2 N/m. We measured the reflectivity of the cantilever at λ = 532 nm to 

be R2 = 0.83 ± 0.05.

The  dielectric  mirror  (which  serves  as  the  cavity  input  coupler)  is  a  12.7  mm-diameter 

concave mirror (CVI PR1-532-99-0537-0.075cc). Its radius of curvature is specified to be r = 75 

mm.  We  measured  its  reflectivity  at  λ  =  532  nm  to  be  R1  =  0.995.  Thus  the  cavity  is 

Throughout this paper we use a coordinate system {x, y, z} whose origin {0,0,0} is defined to 

be the center of curvature of the input coupler. The directions of the x, y, and z axes are shown in 

undercoupled.  

Fig. 1. 

The dielectric mirror is mounted in a tilt stage (ThorLabs KM05) and affixed to one end of 

an Invar spacer. The cantilever is mounted on a second tilt stage which in turn is mounted on a 

piezoelectric stick-slip x-y-z translation stage (AttoCube ANP100 series). This translation stage 

provides  several  mm  of  travel  and  sub-micron  positioning  accuracy  in  all  three  axes.  The 

translation  stage  is  mounted  to  the  end  of  the  Invar  spacer  opposite  the  dielectric  mirror.  The 

spacer is mounted inside a 150 mm-diameter vacuum chamber which provides optical access to 

both ends of the cavity via antireflection-coated windows. 

The cavity is illuminated by λ = 532 nm light from a doubled cw Nd:YAG laser (Innolight 

Prometheus). The collimated laser beam is expanded to a 1/e2 diameter of ωin = 13.5 mm, and 

mode matched to the cavity by a 50 mm diameter, 175 mm focal length lens positioned in front 

of the vacuum chamber. 

Since  the  cantilever  mirror  is  approximately  planar  all  the  cavity  modes  have  waists  at  the 

cantilever.  In  order  to  minimize  the  diameter  of  the  cavity  mode  waists,  we  position  the 

cantilever very close to {0,0,0} (i.e., near-hemispherical geometry). Thus the cavity length L = r 

=  75  mm.  This  is  achieved  by  first  aligning  the  mode-matching  lens  so  that  the  beam  waist  is 

roughly  at  {0,0,0}.  Using  the  piezo  translation  stage  the  cantilever  is  adjusted  in  the  x-y  plane 

until it partially obscures the beam (as monitored via light transmitted through the cavity). Then 

the z position of the cantilever is adjusted until it approaches {0,0,0}. We determine the optimal 

alignment by scanning the cantilever position through a few free cavity spectral ranges (using the 

z-piezo of the AttoCube) and monitoring the reflected signal.  

Figures 2(a)-2(c) show the reflected signal Pr as a function of the displacement δz when the 

cantilever is in different positions along the z axis. At positive displacements along z (i.e., toward 
the input coupler from {0,0,0}), the cavity satisfies 0 < (1 – L/r) < 1 and so is nominally stable9 

(although the diffraction losses may still be large). This is illustrated by the data in Fig. 2(a). As 

 3

the cantilever is moved closer to {0,0,0} the finesse increases and the transverse mode spacing 

decreases.  The  increasing  finesse  presumably  results  from  the  fact  that  the  diffraction  losses 

decrease as the spot size at the cantilever decreases. The decrease of the transverse mode spacing 

is expected for a cavity as the mirror positions approach a hemispherical geometry, and when the 
hemispherical  geometry  is  reached,  the  transverse  modes  should  become  degenerate.10  Figure 

2(b)  shows  a  trace  of  the  cavity  reflection  in  which  the  transverse  modes  are  approximately 

degenerate. We interpret this as a sign that the cantilever is very close to {0,0,0}, and hence that 

the cavity is roughly hemispherical. 

When  the  cantilever  is  translated  beyond  {0,0,0}  (i.e.,  to  negative  z),  the  finesse  drops 

rapidly (Fig. 2(c)). This is because  0 < (1 – L/r) < 1 is no longer satisfied and the cavity is not 

stable. 

When the cantilever is positioned at the optimum z but displaced in the x-y plane the finesse 

also drops. Figure 2(d) shows Pr(z) for the cantilever displaced by approximately 35 μm along its 

narrowest  dimension  (i.e.,  to  {0,  35  μm,  0}).  Although  this  displacement  implies  that  a  large 

fraction  of  the  input  laser  beam  does  not  intersect  the  cantilever,  the  finesse  still  remains 

relatively  high  (~10),  due  to  the  fact  that  the  cavity  modes  readjust  themselves  to  minimize 

Figure 3 shows a finer scan of the cantilever position around {0,0,0}. Fitting the data to the 

diffraction loses.

gives  a  value  for  the  finesse  F  =  55.  This  is  roughly  consistent  with π/(1  -  (R1R2)½),  the  value 

expected in the absence of diffraction losses.  

 

Although  many  of  the  long-term  goals  for  these  devices  involve  quantum  effects, 

micromechanical  optical  cavities  like  the  ones  described  here  can  also  exhibit  interesting 

classical  effects.  One  example  is  optical  control  of  the  cantilever’s  Brownian  motion.  Optical 

control of the Brownian motion is achieved when the optical force on the cantilever has a phase 

lag  relative  to  the  cantilever  motion.  A  positive  phase  lag  decreases  the  cantilever’s  damping 
while a negative phase lag increases it. As discussed extensively elsewhere,11,7 this change in the 

damping corresponds to a change in the effective temperature of the cantilever.

 Figure  4  shows  the  power  spectral  density  of  the  cantilever’s  undriven,  Brownian  motion. 

This  data  is  acquired  using  633  nm  light  from  a  HeNe  laser.  Since  the  dielectric  mirror’s 

reflectivity at 633 nm is only 0.27, the 633 nm light sees a low-finesse (and overcoupled) cavity. 

The lower finesse for this laser helps to ensure that it does not perturb the cantilever motion. In 

addition, only 0.18 mW of 633 nm light is incident on the cavity.   

The data indicated by square points were taken with the 532 nm laser shuttered. Fitting this 

data to the expected form for a damped harmonic oscillator gives a value of the quality factor Q 

= 1925. 

The data indicated by circular points were taken with 4.53 mW of 532 nm light incident on 

the cavity and slightly red-detuned from the cavity resonance. In this data the cantilever Q drops 

to 370. The area under these curves is proportional to 

, the  mean-squared amplitude of the 

2x

cantilever’s Brownian motion. With the 532 nm laser on, 

 is decreased by a factor of ~6.15. 

2x

This implies a reduction of the cantilever’s effective temperature by the same amount, i.e., from 

300 K to ~50 K. 

The  phase  shift  responsible  for  this  cooling    can  have  a  variety  of  origins.  The  two  most 

relevant here  are the  cavity ringdown time τopt=  2LF/πc (which sets the phase lag between the 

radiation pressure and the cantilever motion) and the cantilever’s thermalization time constant τT 

(which  depends  upon  the  thermal  conductivity  and  heat  capacity  of  the  cantilever  and  sets  the 

phase lag due to photothermal forces on the cantilever). From our measurement of F we find τopt 
= 7.5 ns, roughly 2 x 104 times longer than in Ref. 7. However, simple estimates of the radiation 

pressure-induced cooling show that this value of τopt should lead to cooling of only ~15%. The 

fact  that  we  observe  a  factor  of  six  decrease  in  the  cantilever  temperature  suggests  that  the 

majority of this cooling arises from photothermal effects, as in Ref. 7.

Thompson.

Fig.  1:  Scale  drawing  of  the  cavity.  The  cantilever  chip  is  visible  at  the  right-hand  side  of  the 

drawing;  the  cantilever  itself  is  not  visible  at  this  scale.  Also  shown  is  the  orientation  of  the 

coordinate system used in the text. The coordinate system’s origin is at the center of curvature of 

the input coupler. The force of gravity points along the negative y direction. 

Fig.  2:  Reflected  intensity  as  a  function  of  cantilever  displacement  for  four  different  cavity 

geometries.  In  a)  the  cantilever  is  positioned  at  approximately  {0,  0,  400  μm},  i.e.,  400  μm 

towards the input coupler from the input coupler’s center of curvature (the coordinate system is 

given  Fig.  1).  The  cavity  is  nominally  stable,  but  diffraction  losses  appear  to  limit  the  finesse. 

Multiple  transverse  modes  are  visible  within  each  free  spectral  range.  In  b)  the  cantilever  is 

approximately  at  {0,  0,  0},  i.e.,  the  hemispherical  configuration.  Here  the  finesse  is  at  its 

maximum and the transverse modes visible in a) have become degenerate. In c) the cantilever is 

at {0, 0, −500 μm}.  This  renders  the  cavity  unstable  and  leads  to  a  low  finesse.  In  d)  the 

cantilever is approximately at {0, 35 μm, 0}. Here the input beam only partially overlaps with 

the cantilever. 

Fig.  3:  A  more  detailed  scan  of  the  cavity  reflection  peak.  Here  the  cantilever  is  positioned  at 

approximately {0,0,0}, i.e., in the hemispherical geometry. The solid line is a fit to the formula 

given in the text, and corresponds to a finesse F  = 55.

displacement, is plotted with the 532 nm cooling laser off (squares) and on (circles). The solid 

lines are fits to the expected form for a damped harmonic oscillator. With the cooling laser off, 

the fit gives Q = 1925. With the cooling laser on, Q = 370.

Abstract 

Paper examines the validity and soundness of the standard 
equation derived to find the amount of energy stored inside 
an elastic material when it is stretched. The paper also tried 
to include the parameters that where neglected while 
deriving the so-called ‘standard equation’ and thus by trying 
to solve the anomalies associated with it.   

 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Let us begin the paper with a thought experiment.  
 
Consider the wire of length l and area of cross section A is fixed vertically at one end and 
at the other end we hang a substance of mass m.  Due to gravitational force it will exert a 
force of mg downward. This further produces some extension in the wire. Consequently 
the weight will also fall down (or rather go down) by an equal distance to that of the 
change in length. Here we are making an assumption that the elongation x (see the figure) 
is so small so that the change in g,  Δg → 0 and thus g will remain constant (this is done 
for simplicity even other wise also we can do the same – even when one resorts to get 
shelter here he could get for the half of energy but only a meager portion as detailed 
below).  
 
The energy stored in the elastic material, as per the classical equation [1], is  
 
E = ½ x Stretching force x extension                                                      (1)

The equation (1) and (2) shows an unbalance the classical standard equation fails to 
include the half of the energy. Thus it cannot answer what happened to the remaining half 
the energy. 
 
 

2. Analysis 
 
In the classical derivation the change in area has been neglected. Let us include that also 
in our purview:  
 
Case No.1 
 
In the case consider the classical way in which we derived the equation [1] where we 
have neglected the change in area (also considered an ideal situation where there is no 
dissipation of energy and also the Young’s Modulus Y will remain as a constant during 
extension as well during compression – this is followed in the second case also) and 
considered only the change in length and thus we got the equation for the energy stored 
as (1) 
 
Case No.2 
 
Consider a similar case with area, i.e., here the change in length is not taken into account 
(or can be simply stated as neglected – when combined together no parameter will be 
neglected) as it has been already been referred and found. [1] 
 
Here as we are considering the ideal case, the total volume is remaining constant, the 
same condition we applied to find the value of Poisson’s ratio (σ), hence the maximum 
value, of a material under ideal conditions. So here the vale of σ will always be that in the 
ideal case, i.e., equal to 0.5 [2, 3] 
 
Let us represent the force acting downward as 
  F mg=
And that acting in the lateral direction as F’  
It is indispensable to find an expression for F’ in terms of F 
 
For that reflect on this case - We have the stand relation for the longitudinal elongation 
[4, 5] as 

                                                                                                  (4) 

                                                                                             (5) 

, where Y is the Young’s modulus, F is the force acting longitudinally, 
cross section, L is the initial length and l is the change in length. 
And for the lateral compression (as it is not acting normally is all directions) we have

3. Conclusion  
 
The equation for the energy stored in an elastic material during elongation is given by  
W F l
Thus in total, when both the cases are considered we will get the total energy stored 
( F l× ) and there by we could answer any question concerning the law of conservation of 
energy.

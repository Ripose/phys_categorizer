Abstract 
 
In this contribution, we argue that the main discrepancies between model calculations and experimental data 
for macroscopic detector characteristics (leakage current and concentration of effective carriers) after lepton 
and hadron irradiation could be solved naturally considering that the primary defects are self-interstitials, 
classical vacancies and the new predicted fourfold coordinated silicon pseudo-vacancy defect, and that the 
primary defects have significant contributions to change the macroscopic characteristics of detectors. This 
new defect is supposed to be introduced uniformly in the bulk during irradiation, has deep energy level(s) in 
the gap and it is stable in time. If the kinetics of defects is considered, it is possible to obtain a good 
agreement between model calculation and experimental data, and the characteristics of the SiFFCD defect: 
(energy level in the band gap and cross section for minority carrier capture) are indirectly determined. These 
predictions need experimental confirmation. If these hypotheses are correct, thus, in conditions of continuous 
long time irradiation, as e.g. the next LHC collider and its upgrades in energy and luminosity, S-LHC and V-
LHC respectively, or in the usage of these detectors in space experiments, these contributions will represent 
a major problem and must be considered. Implications for the behaviour of silicon detectors, produced from 
different materials, are also considered.

1. Introduction 
 
Particle physics makes its greatest advances with experiments at the highest energies. The way to advance 
to a higher energy regime is through hadron colliders, or non-accelerator experiments, as space astroparticle 
missions and terrestrial experiments with cosmic particles. In the near future, the Large Hadron Collider 
(LHC) will be operational, and beyond that, its upgrades: the Super-LHC (SLHC) and the hypothetical Very 
Large Hadron Collider (VLHC), or Linear Collider. AMS for example will represent a new astroparticle 
physics experiment. 
 
Silicon detectors will be used extensively in the next generation of experiments in high energy physics, 
where they will be exposed to high fast hadron and lepton fluences, as well as in the more hostile 
environments expected in machine upgrade. In the development of detectors, different materials are 
currently used: the standard Float Zone silicon of n or p type, oxygenated FZ, Czochralski silicon n-type, and 
recently magnetic Czochralski or epitaxial layer technology. 
 
When an incident particle is slowed down in silicon, it produces different types of damage. They depend on 
the competition between the cross sections of the corresponding processes, e.g. energy transfer to atomic 
electrons (ionisation) and energy transfer to translation motion of the atom as a whole. While ionisation is the 
basis of particle detection and is reversible, displacement effects produce defects in the lattice, determining 
changes in the material and device characteristics.  

Thus, the principal obstacle to long-time operation arises from bulk displacement damage in silicon, which 
produces primary point defects, and which during annealing processes interact between them or with 
impurities and produce new defects, which increase the leakage current in the detector, decrease the 
satisfactory Signal/Noise ratio, and increase the effective carrier concentration (and thus the depletion 
voltage), which ultimately increase the operational voltage of the device beyond the breakdown voltage. 
These effects must be considered in the design of semiconductor detectors for high energy physics. 
 
In the analysis of the behaviour of silicon detectors after irradiation, the use of a model of defect kinetics and 
the SRH statistics conduces to a good or reasonable agreement between theoretical calculations and 
experimental data for the production and time evolution of the leakage current and effective carrier 
concentration after lepton and gamma irradiation, and discrepancies up to 2 orders of magnitude after 
hadron irradiation, and this in conditions where a reasonable agreement is obtained between experimental 
and calculated concentrations of complex defects. Similar discrepancies have been obtained by different 
groups [1, 2] and some explanations are searched, in fact all associated with the possible existence of 
defects E70, E170, P6 di-interstitials, V2 as clusterised defects [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], contrary with the gamma or 
leptons case where MacEvoy and co-workers claimed that the behaviour of silicon detectors could be 
explained mainly with the contribution of the V2O defect and with the consideration of the inter-defect charge 
exchange mechanism. 
 
In this paper, we argue that the main problems, related to the discrepancies between model calculations and 
experimental data for macroscopic detector characteristics (leakage current and concentration of effective 
carriers) after lepton and hadron irradiation could be solved naturally in the following hypotheses: 

- Primary defects are self-interstitials, classical vacancies and fourfold coordinated silicon pseudo-
vacancy defects, SiFFCD. We supposed that the SiFFCD primary defect is produced simultaneously with the 
usual vacancy with a concentration that must be determined, is uniformly introduced in the bulk during 
irradiation, has deep energy level(s) in the gap and is stable in time. 

- Primary defects have contributions to the change of macroscopic characteristics of detector 

(leakage current and concentration of effective defects). 

- The kinetics of defects is supposed and it is modelled. 
- The detector is a totally depleted p-n junction and the leakage current could be estimated in 

 
agreement with the Schokley – Read – Hall (SRH) statistics. 
 
Starting from available experimental data (for lepton and hadron irradiation) for time dependence of the 
macroscopic parameters of detector, in the hypotheses of the theoretical model developed previously by the 
authors [7] for the kinetics of defects, it is possible to obtain a good agreement of model calculation with 
experimental data, and thus the characteristics of the new SiFFCD defect could be indirectly predicted: its 
energy level in the band gap and its cross section for  minority carrier capture. These predictions need 
experimental confirmation.

If these hypotheses are correct, thus, in conditions of continuous long time irradiation, as e.g. LHC and its 
upgrades in energy and luminosity, S-LHC and V-LHC respectively, or in the usage of this detectors in space 
missions, these contributions will represent a major problem and must be considered. Implications for the 
behaviour of silicon detectors, supposed produced by different materials are also considered.  
 
 
2. Macroscopic characteristics of silicon detectors 
 
The dark current of a reverse biased p - n junction is composed of the following terms: the generation 
current, due to carrier generation on the midgap energy levels inside the depleted region, the drift current, 
due to the drift of minority carriers and surface and perimetral currents, dependent on the environmental 
conditions of the surface and the perimeter of the diode. 
The increase of the leakage current during and after irradiation is due to the generation of electron-hole pairs 
on the energy levels of defects produced, and could be evaluated in the frame of the simplified Shockley-
Read-Hall model [8], [9].In this model each defect is considered with one or more levels in the bandgap, 
uncoupled, and thus the current is simply the sum of defects contributions. The defects which have an 
important contribution to the leakage current are those with energy levels in the vicinity of the mid-gap, and 
with high cross sections for carrier capture.  
Supposing the detector a totally depleted p - n junction, the increase of the volume density of the leakage 
current, j, could be approximately written in agreement with SRH model as:

The calculation of the equilibrium concentrations for a uniform material, in the dilute concentration 
approximation, is discussed by Fahey, Griffin and Plummer [10]. Silicon detectors are basically totally 
depleted p-n junctions, and in the field region, the occupancy of the energy levels is determined by the 
balance of trapping and emission of charge carriers [11]. 
 
The absolute value of the difference between ionised donors and acceptors in the space charge region of the

3.1. Aspects associated with primary defects in silicon 

 
The stability of crystalline silicon comes from the fact that each silicon atom can accommodate its four 
valence electrons in four covalent bonds with its four neighbours. The production of primary defects or the 
existence of impurities or defects destroys the fourfold coordination. 
 
It has been established that the structural characteristics of the “classical” vacancy are: the bond length in 
the bulk is 2.35Å and the bond angle – 109°. The formation energy is 3.01 eV (p-type silicon), 3.17 eV 
(intrinsic), 3.14 eV (n-type).

For interstitials, different structural configurations are possible: a) the hexagonal configuration, a sixfold 
coordinated defect with bonds of length 2.36 Å, joining it to six neighbours which are fivefold coordinated; b) 
the tetrahedral interstitial is fourfold coordinated; has bonds of length 2.44 Å joining it to its four neighbours, 
which are therefore five coordinated; c) the split - <110> configuration: two atoms forming the defect are 
fourfold coordinated, and two of the surrounding atoms are fivefold coordinated. d) the 'caged' interstitial 
contains two normal bonds, of length of 2.32 Å, five longer bonds in the range 2.55π2.82 Å and three 
unbounded neighbours at 3.10π3.35 Å. The calculations [12], [13], [14] found that the tetrahedral interstitial 
and caged interstitial are metastable. For interstitials, the lowest formation energies in eV are 2.80 (for p-type 
material), 2.98 (for n-type) and 3.31 in the intrinsic case respectively. 
It has been established that in silicon the vacancy takes on five different charge states in the band gap: V2+, 
V+, V0, V-, and V2- and the self-interstitial could exists in four charge states after some authors [15]: I-, I0, I+ 
and I2+, or in five states, after other authors [16, 17]. 
 
The experimental examination of primary point defects buried in the bulk is difficult and for various defects 
this is usually indirect. In a series of theoretical studies [18] and correlated EPR and DLTS experiments of 
Watkins and co-workers [19], it became possible to solve some problems associated with the electrical level 
structure of the vacancy. The charge states V2+, V+, V0 form the so-called negative U system, caused when 
the energy gain of a Jahn-Teller distortion is larger than the repulsive energy of the electrons, case in which 
the (0/+) level is inverted in respect to (+/++) level, which are the striking consequence of the fact that the V+ 
charge state is metastable. 
 
Recently, Lukjanitsa [15] identified experimentally all the energy levels assigned to vacancies and 
interstitials. In the following two tables we present a review of the present knowledge on energy levels in the 
band gap for isolated vacancies and interstitials, as experimental data and model calculation together with 
the corresponding charge states.

Recently, using state of the art plane wave density functional theory, Goedecker and co-workers [22] 
predicted the existence of a new type of primary defect: SiFFCD (Fourfolded Coordinated silicon Defect) that is 
a pseudo-vacancy. It is obtained by moving atoms from the initial positions, but this displacement does not 
break the bonds with the neighbours. The bound lengths are between 2.25π2.47 Å and angles vary in the 
97π116° range. So, the bound length and angle do not deviate significantly from their bulk values. The 
formation energy is 2.45 eV (for p-type silicon), 2.42 eV (intrinsic), 2.39 eV (n-type), lower than the energy of 
formation of both vacancies and interstitials. For this defect, it was predicted that it has energy levels in the 
band gap and most probably it is very stable. 
 
 

3.2. Complex defects and their kinetics. Basic model hypothesis and concrete 

mechanisms 
 
The model of kinetics of defects used in the present work has been developed previously, by the authors [7]. 
It describes the formation and evolution of defects in silicon during and after irradiation.  

In the first step of the model, the incident particle interacts with the semiconductor material. The peculiarities 
of the interaction mechanisms are explicitly considered for each particle and kinetic energy.  

In the second step, the recoil nuclei resulting from these interactions lose their energy in the semiconductor 
lattice. Their energy partition between displacements and ionisation is considered in agreement with 
Lindhard's theory [23], [24]. The kinetic energy dependence of the concentration of primary defects on unit 
particle fluence (CPD) is thus calculated for each incident particle, and it is used in the evaluation of the 
generation rate of defects during irradiation.  
 
The third step is devoted to the study of formation and time evolution of complex defects, associations of 
primary defects or of primary defects and impurities. The primary point defects considered here are 
vacancies (as “classical” vacancies and fourfold coordinated vacancy defect: SiFFCD) and silicon self 
interstitials. 
 

Related to the SiFFCD defect we supposed that this defect is produced simultaneously with the classical 
vacancy with a concentration that must be determined, it is uniformly introduced in the bulk during irradiation, 
has deep energy level(s) in the gap, and is stable in time. In these hypotheses, the reaction of production of 
primary defects is:

The primary defects are created at a rate G , as a sum of contributions from thermal generation and 
irradiation; the rate of defect production due to irradiation being calculated as:

The energy dependence of the CPD produced by different incident particles could be found, e.g. in Figure 1

Applying the theory for diffusion-limited reactions, the formation of defects could be described by the reaction 
scheme indicated in the Table 3. The activation energies of the considered processes are also specified:

In the values used for the activation energies, the contribution of a Coulomb potential between ionised 
defects is considered. A detailed discussion about these interactions is done by Fahey and co-workers [10]. 
 
The time evolution of defect concentrations for primary and complex defects produced in silicon is solutions 
of the associated system of simultaneous differential equations. We solved this system numerically.  
 
The results of the modelling must reproduce experimental results both at the microscopic (concentration of 
the defects) and macroscopic level (leakage current and effective concentration of charge carriers).  
The fraction of the vacancies that forms the SiFFCD –defect, the corresponding energy level in the band gap 
and the cross sections for carrier capture will represents the parameters of the model. In these conditions, 
the characteristics of the new defect are indirectly found. 
 
 
 
4. Results, discussions and predictions 

4.1 Numerical results at microscopic level 

 
For concrete calculations, the experimental data for the time evolution of the concentration for VP, VO and 
interstitial C defects after electron irradiation from Song’s paper [26] have been used. The concentrations of 
defects have been calculated numerically, as solutions of the system of differential equations associated with 
the reaction scheme. The reaction constants have been evaluated using data from the literature, and in the 
case these were not available, adjusted in such a way that they could reproduce the time evolution of defect 
concentrations measured experimentally. The values of the activation energies of the processes considered 
are those from Table 3. 
 
In Figure 1, the data for the time evolution of the concentrations of VO, VP and Ci after electron irradiation 
[26] are represented on the same graph with model calculations.

4.2 Numerical results for macroscopic characteristics 

 
 
We also calculated the modifications induced by irradiation in the leakage current and effective carrier 
concentration of silicon detectors, and compared them with available experimental data: the time 
dependence of the leakage current after electron [27], proton [28], positive and negative pion [29] irradiation; 
time dependence of the carrier concentration in the space charge region of the detector after proton [28, 30], 
pion [29] and neutron [31] irradiation. 
 
For the defects with relevant contributions to macroscopic modifications of detectors characteristics, the 
energy levels in the band gap and the cross-sections for minority carriers used in the concrete calculations 
are indicated in Table 4.

continuous lines represent the calculated values, including the contributions of primary defects to defect 
kinetics, with optimised values for the SiFFCD defect. The shadow band represents the interval of values for 
one standard deviation around the average contribution of the SiFFCD defect over all particles.

A special attention must be accorded to the behaviour of Czochralski silicon. It is now well established that 
the heat treatment of Cz-grown oxygen-rich silicon in the 350-500 0C temperature range generates 
microdefects which act as shallow double donor centres, called thermal donors. Several studies, see for 
example the review [35], showed that thermal donors have ionisation energies of about 70 and 150 meV, so 
that they are all ionised, and contribute to the effective carrier concentration. In accord with figure 45 from 
the up cited review paper, the donor generation rate as a function of annealing temperature is of the order 
1014 cm-3h-1, depending by the initial interstitial oxygen concentration. No inversion phenomena is observed 
experimentally for Cz silicon irradiated with pions and protons up to 1015 part/cm2 [36], and no inversion is

found by calculation, in the frame of the model presented here, for the same material, in the specified 
conditions of irradiation. A very good agreement with experimental data is obtained, suggesting the 
robustness of model predictions. 
 
From this analysis, we obtained that the SiFFCD defect is produced with a concentration of about 10% from all 
vacancies per act of interaction, the defect has an energy level in the band gap between  Ec – (0.46 ÷ 0.48) 
eV, a capture cross section between (5·÷10)×10-15 cm2 and a ratio σp/ σn = 1 ÷ 5.  
Thus, considering the contributions of these primary defects to silicon degradation the old discrepancies 
between data and model calculations are for the first time solved. These theoretically results must be 
confirmed experimentally. Probably, also some delayed mechanisms to formation of complex defects that not 
considered in the model must exist and their contributions became observable long time after irradiation, as 
the long time evolutions of macroscopic characteristics modifications suggest. Also, a relatively lower 
accuracy of the calculated results for π+ and π- cases can be caused due to fact that the differences between 
two particles in the calculation of the CPD is not considered. 
 
 
5. Summary 
 
In this paper, considering the contributions of primary defects as: “classical” vacancy, SiFFCD and self-
interstitials to silicon degradation, the old discrepancies between data and model calculations for the leakage 
current and the effective concentration of charge carriers in the space charge region of detectors exposed to 
high fluences of particles, are for the first time disappeared. The new SiFFCD defect is produced with a 
concentration of about 10% from all vacancies per act of interaction, and has an energy level in the band gap 
between  Ec – (0.46 ÷ 0.48) eV.  
The very good agreement between calculations and experimental data suggests the robustness of model 
predictions. The contribution of the primary defects to the damage of detectors after irradiation will represent 
a major problem and must be considered in conditions of continuous long time irradiation, as is expected in 
the high energy physics experiments, at new accelerator facilities or in space.

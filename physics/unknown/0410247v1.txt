Abstract 

Systematic,  long  term  measurements,  starting  in  1963,  of  90Sr  activity 

concentrations  in  sea  water  have  been  performed  at  four  locations  (cities  of  Rovinj, 

Rijeka, Split and Dubrovnik) along the Croatian coast of the Adriatic sea. In addition, 
fallout  samples  were  collected  in  the  city  of  Zadar.  90Sr  activity  concentrations  are  in 

good correlation with the fallout activity, the coefficient of correlation being 0.72. After 
the  nuclear  moratorium  on  atmospheric  nuclear  bomb  tests  in  1960s,  90Sr  activity 
concentrations  in  sea  water  exponentially  dropped  from  14.8 ± 2.4  Bq m-3  in  1963  to 
2.0 ± 0.3 Bq m-3 in 2003. In the same period, the total annual  90Sr land surface deposit 
in Zadar fell by three orders of magnitude, from 713.3 Bq m-2 in 1963 to 0.4 Bq m-2 in 

2003. Using strontium sea water and fallout data, a mathematical model was developed 
to describe the rate of change of   90Sr activity concentrations in the Adriatic sea water 

and estimate its mean residence time in the Adriatic. By fitting the experimental data to 
a theoretically predicted curve, the mean residence time of 90Sr in the Adriatic sea water 

was estimated to be approximately 3.4 ± 0.4 years, standard deviation being calculated 
by Monte Carlo simulations. As in physical oceanography 90Sr can be used as effective  

radioactive  tracer  of  water  mass  transport,  this  value  also  reflects  the  upper  limit  for 

turnover time of the Adriatic sea water. The turnover time of 3.4 years for the Adriatic 

sea water is in reasonable agreement with the value which was estimated, by studying 

water flows through the Strait of Otranto, to be on the order of 1 year.

1. Introduction 

1.1. Position, topography and characteristics of the Adriatic sea 

The  Adriatic  sea,  extending  to  45o  47'  N,  is  the  northernmost  part  of  the 

Mediterranean sea, belonging to the eastern Mediterranean basin. It is located between 

Italy and the Balkan Peninsula. As shown on Fig. 1, it is landlocked on the north, east 

and  west,  and  is  linked  with  the  Mediterranean  through  the  Strait  of  Otranto  to  the 

south. 

Figure 1 about here 

The  Adriatic  is  a  rectangularly  shaped  basin,  oriented  in  an  NW-SE  direction 

with  a  length  of  about  800  km  and  a  width  varying  from  102  to  355  km,  the  average 

being about 250 km. Northern half of the Adriatic can be divided into two sub-basins: 

a) 

A  northernmost  shallow  basin  with  the  bottom  sloping  gently  to  the  south  and 

reaching at most 100 m, then dropping quickly to 200 m just south of Ancona 

b) 

Three pits located along the transversal line of the Italian city of Pescara, one of 

and 

which is known as the Jabuka Pit. 

Southern  half  of  the  Adriatic  consists  of  a  basin,  called  the  South  Adriatic  Pit 

which  is  separated  from  the  middle  basin  by  the  170  m  deep  Palagruza  Sill.  It  is 

characterized by approximately circular isobaths, with a maximum depth of about 1200 

m in the center.  

The bottom rises toward the Strait of Otranto past the southern basin, with the 

strait having a maximum depth of 780 m, and average depth of  325 m, and a width of 

about 75 km. Bottom depth of the Adriatic sea is shown on Fig. 2. 

Figure 2 about here 

The  western  coast  of  the  Adriatic  sea  is  regular,  with  isobaths  running  parallel  to  the 

shoreline  and  depth  increasing  uniformly  seawards.  The  more  rugged  eastern  coast  is 

composed of many islands and headlands rising abruptly from the deep coastal water.

Physical  characteristics  of  the  Adriatic  sea  (Leksikografski  institut,  1979)  are 

summarized in Table 1. 

Table 1 About here 

1.2. Hydrology and meteorology 

Geomorphological  characteristics  of  the  Adriatic  sea  (elongated  shape,  almost 

land  locked  position  between  the  mountains  situated  on  Balkan  and  Italian  Peninsulas 

and  relatively  shallow  waters,  especially  in  northern  part)  play  important  part  in 

controlling the dynamics of its waters. Due to its landlocked position, the Adriatic sea is 

subject to highly variable atmospheric forcing. As a result, the oceanographic properties 

of the Adriatic sea, like circulation and distribution of its water masses strongly depend 

on the characteristics of air-sea fluxes (Cushman-Roisin, 2001).  

The long-term average runoff rate along the Adriatic coast is 5500 - 5700 m3 s-1, 
 
the Po river carrying alone 28% of the total runoff, i.e., 1540 - 1600 m3 s-1. (Cushman-

Roisin  et  al.,  2001;  Sekulic  and  Vertacnik,  1996;  Raicich  1996.)  It  can  easily  be 

calculated that on annual scale, total runoff corresponds to annual addition of about 1.3 

m  thick  water  layer  over  the  whole  basin,  which  is  approximately  0.5 %  of  the  total 

Adriatic sea volume. 

The water exchange pattern between the Adriatic and the greater Mediterranean 

through the Strait of Otranto, suggests an inflow along the eastern and outflow along the 

western  coast.  The  outflowing  portion  of  the  water  exchange  though  the  strait  area, 

consists of a surface Adriatic water and cold outflowing vein of the dense water formed 

in the Adriatic. The inflowing water from the Mediterranean origin is more saline and 

warmer.  Surface currents are responsible for the transports of an important part of the 

marine  pollutants  and  for  the  freshwater  dispersion.  The  circulation  regime  varies 

seasonally and inter annually in response to changes in the heating and wind regimes. 

Seasonally,  the  winter  circulation  is  characterized  by  a  prevalence  of  warmer 

Mediterranean  inflow  reinforced  by  southerly  winds.  In  summer,  there  is  a  slightly 

stronger outflow of fresher and warmer Adriatic water (Cushman-Roisin, 2001).

Mainly  during  the  winter,  the  Adriatic  Sea  region  is  under  a  continuous 

influence of passing mid-latitude meteorological perturbations and of the wind systems 

associated  with  them.  The  two  main  wind  systems  are  the  Bora  and  the  Scirocco, 

although Adriatic seawater  circulation is also influenced by the local wind Maestral, the 

northwesterly wind typical of the summer season in the Adriatic. The Bora is a dry and 

cold wind blowing in an offshore direction from the eastern coast. The Scirocco blows 

from the southeast (i.e. along the longitudinal axis of the basin) bringing rather humid 

and  relatively  warm  air  into  the  region.  In  particular,  the  Bora  produces  appreciable 

buoyancy fluxes through evaporative and sensible heat loss, induces both wind-driven 

and thermohaline circulation, and, what is most important, is responsible for deep water 

formation  processes  (Leksikografski  institut,  1979;  Cushman-Roisin,  2001).  Namely, 

the Adriatic Sea being exposed to very low winter temperatures and violent episodes of 

the Bora wind, has been identified as one of the regions of the world oceans where deep 

water  formation  processes  take  place.  Meteorological  conditions  favourable  to  dense 

water  formation  cause  rapid  mixing  of  surface  waters  with  deeper  water  layers.  This 

dense water, called Adriatic Deep Water (ADW) spreads through the Strait of Otranto, 

being an important component of the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water (EMDW) and 

contributing to their ventilation (Ovchinnikov et al., 1985). 

1.3 Radioactivity in the marine environment 

Radionuclides are of interest to marine scientists for two primary reasons: a) as 

potential contaminants of the ocean biosphere and b) as radioactive tracers for studies of 

water masses, sediment movements and various other parameters. The dominant route 

for  the  introduction  of  artificial  radionuclides  into  the  environment,  until  the  nuclear 

accident in Chernobyl on 26 April 1986, has been the radioactive fallout resulting from 

the  atmospheric  nuclear  weapon  tests.  Atmospheric  nuclear  explosions  have  been 

conducted  since  1945  and  were  specially  intensive  in  1960s,  i.e.,  before  a  nuclear 

moratorium  became  effective.  However,  similar,  but  smaller  tests  were  performed  by 

the  Chinese  and  French  also  in  the  1970s  and  afterwards.  Therefore,  activity 

concentrations  of  fission  products  in  most  of  the  environmental  samples  could  be 
expected to be in good correlation with fallout activity (i.e., surface deposit in Bqm-2). 
Among the man-made, i.e., anthropogenic radionuclides present in global fallout, 137Cs 

4

and 90Sr have been regarded as the fission products of a major potential hazard to living 

beings  due  to  the  unique  combination  of  their  relatively  long  half-lives,  and  their 

chemical  and  metabolic  properties  resembling  those  of  the  potassium  and  calcium 

respectively.  

The  addition  of  artificial  radioactive  material  to  the  marine  environment 

inevitably results not only in increased radiation exposure to a marine biota, but also to 

some  added  radiation  exposure  to  people  who  use  the  sea  and  its  products. 

Consequently,  concern  for  safety  and  radiation  protection  has  worldwide  stimulated 

much  basic  research  dealing  with  radioactivity  in  the  marine  environment.  Such 

investigations  take  significant  part  in  an  extended  and  still  ongoing  monitoring 

programme  of  radioactive  contamination  of  human  environment  in  Croatia  as  well 

(Popovic, 1963 - 1978; Bauman et al., 1979 - 1992; Kovac et al., 1993 - 1998; Marovic 

et al., 1999 - 2002). 

1.4 Tracer studies in the Adriatic Sea 

The investigations of radionuclides in the marine environment include studies of 

man-made  ones  (fallout  radionuclides  as  well  as  radionuclides  released  from  various 

nuclear  facilities)  that  are  already  present  in  water,  or  by  releasing  specific 

radionuclides  into  the  water  in  tracer  experiments.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  the 

purpose  of  a  tracer  experiments  can  be  used  also  some  non-radioactive  elements  or 

substances.  In  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  Roether  et  al.  have  been  conducting 

measurements of transient tracers (such as CFCs, helium and tritium) for more than last 

two decades (Roether and Schlitzer, 1991; Roether et al., 1994.) Initially they have been 

used  to  study  deep  water  formation  rates  in  the  Adriatic  and  to  identify  the  spreading 

pathways to the Mediterranean as well as to study their representation in models. At the 

end  of  the  1980s  the  thermohaline  circulation  of  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  changed 

abruptly causing the Aegean sea to replace the Adriatic sea as a much stronger source of 

deep  water  formation.  This  major  event  has  been  named  Eastern  Mediterranean 

Transient (EMT) and was attributed to important meteorological anomalies in the region 

as well as to changes in circulation patterns. The subsequent tracer surveys have been 

very valuable in documenting the ongoing-changes. Although the initial perturbation of 

the  thermohaline  circulation  was  rather  short-lived,  the  effects  are  apparently 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5

long-lasting on time scales of decades. Water mass variability induced by the EMT was 

originally largest in the deep water but is now present in all water masses. Most recent 

tracer data from 2002 demonstrate that at present the strongest changes are to be found 

in the intermediate waters. 

Regarding  the  long-term  behaviour  of  fallout  radionuclides  in  the  Eastern 

Mediterranean,  Franic  and  Bauman  studied  radioactive  contamination  of  the  Adriatic 
sea by  90Sr and  137Cs. Papucci et al. and Delfanti et al. analysed existing and new data 
on  137Cs  distribution  in  the  Eastern  Mediterranean  (Papucci  and  Delfanti,  1999; 

Delfanti, 2003). In recent study Sanchez-Cabeza et al. (2002) performed long-term box 
modelling  of  137Cs  in  the  Mediterranean  sea.  The  main  sources  of  the  137Cs  to  the 

Mediterranean  area  are  fallout  from  past  nuclear  weapon  testing  and  the  Chernobyl 
accident in 1986. From 1963 to 1986, the  137Cs activity concentrations in surface water 

had  regularly  decreased,  reflecting  the  decrease  of  the  atmospheric  input  and  vertical 
transport  processes.  The  137Cs  vertical  profiles  were  characterised  by  decreasing 

concentrations from surface to bottom. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the only vertical 

profiles  before  the  EMT  were  obtained  by  Fukai  et  al.  in  mid  seventies  (Fukai  et  al, 
1980). 137Cs  surface concentrations ranged  between 4.2 and 5.5 Bq m-3 over the entire 

basin  (Fukai  et  al.,  1980)  including  the  Adriatic  sea  (Franic  and  Bauman,  1993).  The 

profiles  showed  subsurface  maxima  in  the  upper  400   m  and  an  exponential  decrease 
towards the bottom. It is reasonable to assume that the spatial distribution of 137Cs  was 

similar  to  that  of  a  tritium  in  1978  (Roether  and  Schlitzer,  1991.),  which  showed 

concentrations  below  1500  m  decreasing  from  the  Western  Ionian  Sea  towards  the 

Levantine  basin.  These  distributions  reflected 

the  circulation 

in 

the  Eastern 

Mediterranean,  with  tracer-rich  dense  waters  of  Adriatic  origin  flowing  first  into  the 

bottom of the Western Ionian Sea and then spreading eastward. In 1986 the fallout from 
the Chernobyl accident produced a sharp increase in 137Cs  concentration at the surface 

of the Eastern and Northern Mediterranean basins. However, the pre-Chernobyl levels 

were reached again in 1990.  

In 1995, the vertical profiles of 137Cs at the two sides of  Crete showed that the 
 
new deep water of Aegean origin was marked by relatively high concentrations of  137Cs 
ranging from 2 to 2.5 Bq m-3 (Papucci and Delfanti, 1999). The vertical profiles in the 
Ionian and Levantine Seas showed surface concentrations around 3 Bq m-3. However, in 

 

 

 

 

6

the  bottom  layer,  they  significantly  differed  from  the  old  profiles.  In  the  Ionian  Sea, 
minimum concentrations (1-1.5 Bq m-3) were found in the depth interval 750-1500 m, 
followed  by  an  increase  up  to  2.5  Bq  m-3  from  2000  m  to  the  bottom.  These  results 

indicate that the deep layer was still characterised by the presence of EMDW, and the 
increase  in  137Cs    concentration  was  due  to  its  continuous  transport  from  surface  to 

bottom through convection processes in the Adriatic Sea. 

It should be noted that the long-term data on  90Sr activity concentrations in sea 

waters  worldwide  are  very  scarce  or  non  existent,  which  can  mainly  be  attributed  to 

long and tedious sample preparation and complex measurement procedure. In addition, 
due to  relatively constant 137Cs:90Sr activity ratios in environmental samples prior to the 

Chernobyl  accident,  generally  ranging  between  values  1  and  3,  for  pure    monitoring 
purposes it was straightforward to calculate  90Sr activity concentrations from the  137Cs 

obtained by gammaspectrometric measurements. Since both of these nuclides have inert 

gaseous precursors in their fission chains and similar radiological half-lives, substantial 

fractionation  from  the  time  of  their  creation  by  atmospheric  nuclear  weapon  tests  is 

considered  unlikely.  The  expected  value  of  this  ratio  in  global  fallout,  for  the 

pre-Chernobyl period, computed by Harley et al. (1965), based upon measured fission 

product yields was about 1.45. Thus, all of the fallout entering the sea was assumed to 
carry  approximately  this  ratio  of  137Cs  to  90Sr.  In  the  Adriatic  sea,  the  mean  value  of 
137Cs to  90Sr ratio in the period 1978 - 1985 was relatively constant, being 1.52 ± 0.40 

(Franic and Bauman, 1993), which is in reasonable agreement with the values 1.5 - 1.6 

determined  for  other  seas  (Volchok  et  al.,  1971;  Kupferman  et  al.,  1979).  As  the 

consequence  of  the  nuclear  accident  at  Chernobyl,  this  ratio  has  been  notably  altered. 

Namely, since refractory components of the Chernobyl debris were deposited closer to 

the  accident  location  than  the  more  volatile  constituents,  due  to  the  volatile  nature  of 
cesium and the refractory nature of strontium the 137Cs:90Sr activity ratio in the Adriatic 
region  significantly  increased.  Also,  137Cs  deposition  patterns  around  Europe  were 
extremely  nonuniform  (EC,  2001).  Consequently,  although  data  on  137Cs  activity 

concentrations in the sea waters worldwide are available, after the Chernobyl accident it 
was not possible from these data to estimate 90Sr activities. 

 
In this paper are presented the results of long-term systematic measurements of 
90Sr activity concentrations in the Adriatic sea water and fallout, which were then used 

 

 

 

 

7

to  estimate  its    mean  residence  time  in  the  Adriatic  sea  water,  reflecting  also  the 
turnover time of sea water in Adriatic itself. Namely, in physical oceanography 90Sr can 

be used as radioactive tracer to study water mass transport, due to apparent constancy of 
stable strontium in the sea at relatively high concentrations of about 8 mg L-1. However 
as the levels of 90Sr activity concentrations in the sea water decreased, studies involving 

that  radionuclide  became  much  scarcer  since  they  involve    long,  tedious  and  costly 

radiochemical procedures. 

1.5.  Literature  data  on  water  exchange  between  the  Adriatic  and  the  Ionian  seas  and 

turnover time of the Adriatic sea water 

The water exchange through the Strait of Otranto between the Adriatic and the 

Ionian  sea  has  been  the  subject  of  a  series  of  experimental  investigations  and  more 

recently  also  of  some  numerical  studies,  which  is  extensively  presented  in  Cushman-

Roisin  et  al.  (2001).  From  the  data  on  water  fluxes  through  strait  can  be  easily 

calculated  the  turnover  time  of  the  Adriatic  sea  water  by  calculating  the  annual  water 

mass flowing through the strait and dividing it by the total volume of the Adriatic sea. 

Earlier results on the volume transport of sea water through the Strait of Otranto 

that had been obtained from very limited and sporadic current measurement, lead to the 

estimate  of  turnover  time  of  approximately  5  years  (Leksikografski  institut,  1979). 

However, as the measured values of volume transport of sea water on certain spots had 
been in range of 2 × 103 to 5 x 105 m3 s-1 (Leksikografski institut, 1979), that called for 

further  investigations.  Estimates  by  Zore-Armanda  and  Pucher-Petrovic  (1976)  gave 
flux  of  4.05 × 105  m3 s-1,  leading  to  the  turnover  time  of  2.7  years.  It  should  be  noted 

that  this  flux  has  been  estimated  for  wintertime.  Mosetti  (1983)  computed  water 
transport  through  strait  and  obtained  values  ranging  from    3 × 105  to  1 × 106  m3 s-1, 

which corresponds to  the respective turnover times of 3.7 and 1.1 years, with the best 
estimate  around  4 × 105  m3 s-1,  which  corresponds  to  the  turnover  time  of  2.8  years. 
Summer  flux  that  has  been  estimated  by  Orlic  et  al.  (1992)  to  be  2.52 × 105  m3 s-1, 

corresponds to the turnover time of 4.4 years. 

The flux estimates obtained from the direct current measurements data, and by 

numerical  integration  from  the  vertical  distribution  of  the  mean  seasonal  inflowing 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8

current  component  at  the  Otranto  transect  lead  to  annual  mean  volume  transport  of 
1.09 × 103  to  5 x 106  m3 s-1,  i.e.  to  turnover  time  of  1.0  years.  This  values  seem  more 

consistent with ADW formation rates as well as ADW outflow rates (Cushman-Roisin 

et al., 2001). 

 
In  recent  study  Sanchez-Cabeza  et  al.  (2002)  performed    long-term  box 
modelling  of  137Cs  in  the  Mediterranean  sea.  The  prediction  values  of  their  numerical 
code, validated against literature data on 137Cs activity concentrations in the sea waters, 

were  quite  satisfactory  in  keeping  with  observations.  The  generic  value  for  a  total 
outflow from the Adriatic sea to the Ionian sea in that model was 3.8 × 105 m3 s-1, which 

leads to the turnover time of the Adriatic sea water of 2.9 years. 

It should be noted that all above values for the water transport through the strait 

appear to be rather  small, leading to overestimation of turnover time, considering that 
estimates of the average annual rate of Adriatic deep water formation are about 3 × 105 
m3 s-1  (Roether  and  Schlitzer,  1991;  Lascaratos  1993)  and  that  ADW  makes  only  one 

part of the total volume of the Adriatic waters exchanged through the Strait of Otranto. 

 
Vetrano  et  al.  (1999)  estimated  the  annual  mean  volume  transport  during  year 
1995 to be (1.11 ± 0.44) × 106 m3 s-1. This has been done by numerical integration from 

the  vertical  distribution  of  the  mean  inflowing  current  component  at  Otranto  transect. 

Therefore this results seem to be the most consistent with ADW formation rates. These 

water fluxes corresponds to the Adriatic sea water turnover time of 0.7 to 1.7 years. 

In conclusion, literature data for Adriatic sea water turnover time range from 0.7 

to 5 years, although recent estimates obtained from direct current measurements in the 

Strait of Otranto are on the order of 1 year. 

2. Material and methods 

2.1. Sampling and radioactivity measurements 

90Sr has been analysed in the sea water samples and fallout in the Adriatic since 

1963.  Sea-water  samples,  150  -  200  L  each,  were  collected  twice  a  year  (in  May  and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9

October, if feasible) 3 km from the shore, at a depth of 0.5 m, at four sampling locations 

of the Adriatic Sea: towns of Rovinj and Rijeka in North Adriatic, town of Split in Mid-

Adriatic  and  town  of  Dubrovnik  in  South  Adriatic.  Reference  methods  for  collecting 

procedure and handling of the sea water samples were taken from International Atomic 

Energy Agency reference book (IAEA, 1970). Fallout samples were collected monthly 

in the town of Zadar (Mid-Adriatic). The funnels which were used for fallout collection 
had a 1 m2 area. Precipitation height was measured by Hellman pluviometer. Sampling 

sites and their coordinates are given in Fig. 1. 

For  the  determination  of  strontium  in  fallout  and  sea  water  were  used 

radiochemical methods (U. S. Department of Energy, 1957 - 1997; Bauman, 1974). 

The  radioactivity  of  90Sr  was  determined  by  beta-counting  its  decay  product, 
 
90Y,  in  a  low-background,  anti-coincidence,  shielded  Geiger-Müller  counter.  Counting 
time depended on 90Sr activity concentration in samples, but was never less than 60,000 

s, typically being 80,000 s. 

 Quality  assurance  and  intercalibration  of  radioactivity  measurements  were 

performed  through  participation  in  the  IAEA  and  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) 

international quality control programmes. 

 
It should be noted that the sampling locations were chosen not for the purpose of 
this  investigation,  i.e.  studies  of    90Sr  mean  residence  time  in  the  Adriatic  and  water 

mass  transport,  but  as  a  part  of  an  extended  monitoring  programme  of  radioactive 

contamination of Croatian environment. 

 
2.2. 90Sr activity concentrations in sea water and fallout 

Measured  90Sr  activity  concentrations  in  the  Adriatic  sea  were  found  to  be 

approximately  equal  on  all  observed  locations,  not  differing  from  the  rest  of  the 

Mediterranean  sea  (Franic  and  Bauman,  1993).  It  was  estimated  that  approximately 

85%  of  all  man-made  radioactive  contamination  in  the  Mediterranean  comes  from 
fallout (UNEP, 1991). Consequently, in the Adriatic, 90Sr activity concentrations are in 

good  correlation  with  the  fallout  activity,  the  coefficient  of  correlation  being  0.72 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10

(Franic and Bauman, 1993). 

As indicated on Figure 4, an exponential decline of  90Sr activity concentrations 
 
in sea water followed the nuclear moratorium in 1960s.  90Sr activity concentrations in 
the  Adriatic  sea  water  dropped  from  14.8 ± 2.4  Bq m-3  in  1963  to  2.0 ± 0.3  Bq m-3  in 

2003. Over the entire study period of 41 years, the maximum and minimum activities, 
17.5  and  0.9  Bq m-3,  were  detected  in  Split  in  1963  and  in  Dubrovnik  in  1983.  In  the 

same  period,  the  total  annual  land  surface  deposit  in  Zadar  fell  by  three  orders  of 
magnitude, from 713.3 Bq m-2 in 1963 to 0.4 Bq m-2 in 2003. The integrated delivery of 
90Sr  through  atmospheric  fallout  for  the  period  1963  -  2003  was  2.91 kBq m-2.  If  this 
value  is  considered  with  respect  to  the  Adriatic  sea  surface  area  of  1.386 x 1011 m2 
(Leksikografski  institut,  1979)  an  estimate  of  4.04 × 1014  Bq  is  obtained  as  the  total 
fallout delivery of  90Sr into the Adriatic sea for that period. 

 
It  should  be  noted  that  the  Chernobyl  accident  did  not  cause  any  significant 
increase  of    90Sr  activity  concentration  in  sea  water,  as  well  as  in  most  of  the 

environmental  samples  in  Croatia,  the  exception  being  water  samples  from  cisterns 

collecting rainwater from roofs etc. (Franic et al., 1999). Unlike the atmospheric testing 

of nuclear weapons, the radionuclides that originated from the Chernobyl accident were 

not  released  directly  to  the  upper  atmosphere.  As  the  result  of  a  release  mechanism 

(prolonged  burning  of  a  graphite  moderator  from  a  damaged  nuclear  reactor)  and 

prevailing  meteorological  conditions  at  that  time,  the  less  volatile  components  of 
Chernobyl  debris  (e.g.,  90Sr)  were  deposited  closer  to  the  accident  location  than  the 
more  volatile  constituents  (e.g.,  137Cs)  (Aarkrog,  1988).  Thus,  90Sr  was  only  in  minor 

quantities subjected to global dispersion processes as it was deposited to the surface of 

Earth  within  a  period  of  few  weeks  after  the  accident.  In  addition,  changing 

meteorological  conditions  with  winds  blowing  from  different  directions  at  various 

altitudes  and  prolonged  release  from  a  damaged  reactor  resulted  in  very  complex 

dispersion  patterns  over  Europe.  Consequently,  the  Adriatic  region,  except  from  the 

very  northern  and  very  southern  part,  was  initially  unaffected  by  the  plumes  of 

contaminated  air  (UNSCEAR,  1988;  UNEP,  1991).  Also,  the  late  spring  and  early 

summer of 1986 in Croatia were rather dry, leading to relatively low direct radioactive 

contamination, which was especially true for the Adriatic region (Bauman et al., 1979-
1992).  Therefore,  the  average  90Sr  activity  concentration  in  the  Adriatic  sea  water  in 
1986  was  2.1 ± 1.5  Bq m-3.  The  minor  increase  was  detected  only  in  the  sea-water 

 

 

11

sample  collected  in  Dubrovnik  in  May  1986,  with  90Sr  activity  concentration  of 
4.7 ± 0.4  Bq m-3.  However,  that  sampling  coincided  with  a  heavy  rain  in  Dubrovnik 
region.  For  comparison,  the  90Sr  activity  concentrations  reported  for  the  Black  and 
Aegean seas in 1987 were significantly greater, 17.0 - 77.7 Bq m-3 and 3.7 - 13.3 Bq m-3 

respectively (Polikarpov et al., 1991). 

 
2.3. Model of the 90Sr circulation in the Adriatic sea 

To establish a simple mathematical model of the  90Sr circulation in the Adriatic 

sea water, the whole Adriatic was considered to be a single, well-mixed water reservoir, 

although it is probably not entirely true for the deep waters from the pits. However, the 
volume of these waters is small compared to the volume of the entire Adriatic. The 90Sr 

coming  into  the  Adriatic  sea  by  fallout  and  runoff  due  to  the  rapid  mixing  of  surface 

waters  with  the  intermediate  water  layer,  together  with  the  surface  waters,  sinks  to 

deeper  water  layers  and  eventually,  due  to  the  general  circulation  pattern,  leaves  the 
Adriatic. Also, the assumption was made that the levels of  90Sr activity concentrations 

in Adriatic and Ionian sea waters were approximately the same. 

Then, the rate of change of 90Sr activity concentrations in the Adriatic sea can be 

described by the simple mathematical model: 

dAAS(t) / dt = - keff AAS(t) + I(t) 

(1) 

where: 
AAS(t)  is the total, time-dependant 90Sr activity (Bq) in the Adriatic sea calculated from 

measured 90Sr activity concentrations in the sea water, 
the observed (effective) mean residence time of 90Sr (y) in a reservoir and 
the total annual 90Sr input to the Adriatic sea (Bq y-1). 

1/keff 

I(t) 

However,  the  observed  constant  which  describes  the  rate  of  decreasing  of  90Sr 
 
activity concentration in the sea water has to be corrected for the 90Sr radioactive decay. 

Therefore: 

keff  = - kS  +  λ 

(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12

is the decay constant for 90Sr, i.e., 0.0238 y-1 (ICRP, 1988) and 
the mean residence time of 90Sr in the Adriatic sea (y). 
The total, time-dependant  90Sr activity in the Adriatic sea can be calculated by 

multiplying the observed activity concentration data in the sea water by the volume of 

where: 

λ 

1/kS 

the reservoir: 

AAS(t) = AASo(t) VAS 

(3) 

where: 
AAS(t)  is the total, time-dependant 90Sr activity (Bq) in the Adriatic sea, 
AASo(t) observed (measured) time-dependant 90Sr activity concentrations (Bq m-3) in the 

Adriatic sea for respective years and 
the volume of the Adriatic sea (3.5 × 1013 m3). 

VAS 

The input of  90Sr to the Adriatic sea consists of three main components: fallout, 

runoff and influx of water into Adriatic through the Strait of Otranto. Input by fallout 
was  estimated  by  multiplying  the  observed  fallout  data  (Bqm-2)  by  the  area  of  the 
Adriatic  sea  (1.386 × 1011 m2).  The  assumption  was  made  that  fallout  data  obtained 

from  the  measurements  in  the  city  of  Zadar  are  fair  representations  for  the  whole 
Adriatic area, which might not be necessarily true. The time dependent 90Sr input I(t) in 

the Adriatic sea by fallout can therefore be modelled as: 

If (t) = If (0) exp (- kf t)  =  S Df (0) exp (- kf t) 

(4) 

where: 

If(0) 

kf 

S 

Df(0) 

is the initial input of 90Sr in the Adriatic sea by fallout (Bq), 
a constant describing the rate of annual decrease of   90Sr activity concentration 
in fallout (y-1), 
the area of the Adriatic sea (1.386 × 1011 m2) and 
the initial 90Sr annual surface deposit by fallout per unit area (Bq m-2). 

 
By fitting the fallout experimental data for the 1963 - 2003 period (Fig. 3), for kf 
is  obtained  0.388  y -1  and  for  initial  value,  i.e.,  D(0),  was  obtained  112.6  TBq,  which 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13

corresponds to the surface deposit of 812 Bq m-2 for the year 1963. 

Figure 3 about here 

As can be seen from the Fig. 3, the rate of decrease of 90Sr activity concentration 

in  fallout  in  1960s  is  very  fast,  slowing  ever  since.  From  the  exponential  curve,  the 
mean residence time of 90Sr in fallout, 1/kf, was calculated to be about 3 years. 

 
To estimate runoff contribution to the input, it is reasonably to assume that the 
90Sr  activity  concentrations  in  runoff  depend  upon  activity  concentrations  in  fallout, 

since  correlation  has  been  found  between  fallout  and  sea  water  activities,  as  well  as 

between fallout and activities of fresh water (Franic and Bauman, 1993; Bauman et al., 

1979 - 1992). The long-term average runoff rate along the Adriatic coast is 5500 - 5700 
m3 s-1 (Cushman-Roisin et al., 2001), the biggest contributor of fresh water being the Po 
river, with annual mean runoff of about 1,700 m3 s-1. In addition, a land runoff, which is 
not collected into rivers, was estimated to be 1100 m3 s-1 (Cushman-Roisin et al., 2001). 
The  total  runoff  of  6800  m3 s-1  adds  annually  about  215  km3  of  fresh  water  to  the 
Adriatic. Assuming the 90Sr activity concentrations in runoff to be similar to those in sea 
water, runoff would on annual basis add less than 3% to the  90Sr input to the Adriatic 
sea. Consequently, the initial value for  90Sr input by fallout into the Adriatic, adjusted 

for runoff, is 116 Tbq. 

Finally,  the  amount  of  90Sr  entering  the  Adriatic  sea  by  influx  of  sea  water 
 
through the Strait of Otranto is proportional to the 90Sr activity concentrations (Bq m-3) 

in the Ionian sea and the volume of water entering the Adriatic. Assuming that the mean 
residence time of  90Sr in the Adriatic sea also reflects the turnover time of the Adriatic 
sea water, the annual activity of  90Sr entering the Adriatic through  the Strait of Otranto 

would be proportional to the volume of sea water passing  through  the Strait of Otranto 

into the Adriatic, which is equal to the volume of the Adriatic sea divided by the mean 

residence time, i.e. VAS / TM = VAS × kS. In the Adriatic sea this activity exponentially 
decreases  with  the  constant  keff  described  by  the  equation  (2).  Therefore,  90Sr  activity 

entering the Adriatic through Strait of Otranto can be described by equation: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14

IIS (t)  = VAS kS AISo (0) exp (- keff t) 

(5) 

where: 

IIS (t) 

AISo 

is the annual input of  90Sr to the Adriatic sea from Ionian sea (Bq) and 
the initial observed activity concentration of  90Sr in the Ionian sea (Bq m-3). 

After  combining  equation  (1)  with  (2),  (3),  (4)  and  (5)  and  solving  for  AAS(t) 

with initial conditions If(0) = I(year 1963) and AASo(0) = AASo(year 1963), the following 

solution is obtained: 

AAS (t)  = If (0) / (kS + λ - kf) { exp (- kf t) - exp [-(kS  + λ) t] } + 
 
+ VAS [AASo (0) +  AISo (0) kS t]  exp [- (kS  + λ) t] 

(6) 
 

 

 
Equation  (6)  is  then  fitted  to  the  90Sr  activity  data  in  the  Adriatic  sea  water  obtained 
from the equation (3). As  90Sr data for the Ionian sea are unavailable, it was assumed 
that the initial  90Sr activity concentration in the Ionian sea was approximately equal to 

its activity concentration in the Adriatic. 

3. Results and discussion 

 
3.1. The mean residence time of 90Sr in the sea water 

 
By  fitting  the  experimental  data  to  a  theoretically  predicted  curve  (6),  the 
unknown  parameter  kS  was  calculated  to  be  0.307  y-1.  Although  the  model  (6)  is 

simplified representation of the real situation, the fit is reasonably good, the coefficient 

of correlation between experimental and predicted data being 0.74. However, as shown 

on Fig. 4, the model under represents the real data on the far end (i.e. from early 1980s) 

since by that time the activity concentrations both in fallout and sea water became very 

low, essentially reaching equilibrium. 

Figure 4 about here 

The mean residence time of  90Sr in the Adriatic, being the reciprocal value of kS

was estimated to be approximately TM = 3.3 years. As   90Sr is an effective radioactive 

tracer of water mass transport, this value also reflects the turnover time of the Adriatic 

sea  water.  However,  this  value  could  be  regarded  as  an  upper  limit  averaged  over  the 

period of 40 years. 

 
The  value  of  3.3  years  is  approximately  4  times  smaller  compared  to  the 
observed residence time of  90Sr in the Adriatic sea, which was calculated, by fitting the 
observed  90Sr activity concentrations in sea water to exponential curve, to be 12.4 years 

(Franic and Bauman 1993). 

3.2. Error estimation and sensitivity analysis 

In order to obtain the standard deviation of  TM, Monte Carlo simulations were 

performed. To be on a conservative side, as well as to simplify calculations, the uniform 
distribution  has  been  assumed  over  the  A ± s  value  of  90Sr  sea  water  activity 

concentrations for respective years, although normal would be more realistic. For each 

year the random value was generated over the interval [A - s, A + s] and then from such 

set of data was estimated the 1/kS value by fitting to the equation (6). The process has 

been  repeated  100  times  and  100  values  for  1/kS  were  obtained.  The  mean  value  and 

standard deviation for TM = 1/kS were calculated to be 3.3 ± 0.4 years. 

In  order  to  estimate  which  parameter  from  the  equation  (6)  mostly  affects  the 

final result, was performed sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis involves perturbing 

each  parameter    of  model  by  a  small  amount,  while  leaving  all  other  parameters  at 

nominal (preselected) values and quantifying the relative effect on the model prediction. 

Usually  it  is  performed  by  increasing  or  decreasing  each  parameter  over  its  entire 

expected range by a fixed percentage of the nominal value. In the case of model (6) the 

parameters  that  affect  the  final  result  are  strontium  input  into  the  sea  water  by  fallout 
and  runoff,  input  from  the  Ionian  sea  (which  itself  depends  upon  90Sr  activity 
concentration  in  Ionian  sea  and  water  flux  through  the  Strait  of  Otranto)  and  90Sr 

activity concentrations in the Adriatic sea.  As previously noted, the sampling locations 
for the long-term investigations of  90Sr in the Adriatic were not chosen for the purpose 
to  estimate  of  the  total  content  of    90Sr  in  the  Adriatic  sea  needed  for  studying  mean 
residence time of  90Sr and water mass transport, but as a part of an extended monitoring 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16

programme of radioactive contamination of Croatian environment. In addition, 90Sr data 

for  the  Ionian  sea  are  unavailable.  The  range  over  which  were  varied  each  of  critical 

parameters in the model, i.e., AAS, AIS and If, was arbitrarily chosen to be ±25% around 

the nominal value. 

 

 
Increasing  the  90Sr  input  by  fallout  25%,  equation  (6)  yields  for  the  mean 
 
residence time of 90Sr in sea water value of 3.0 years. On the other side, by decreasing 

fallout input 25%, the mean residence time of 3.6 years is obtained. Implementation of 
similar procedure for the input of 90Sr through the water mass transport form the Ionian 

sea,  yields  the  values  of  2.9  and  3.7  years  for  a  volume  increase  of  25%  and  volume 
decrease of 25% respectively. Finally, increase and decrease of  90Sr total activity in the 

Adriatic sea lead to respective turnover times of  3.5 and 2.9 years. 

On Fig. 5 is shown how the mean residence time of 90Sr in the sea water depends 

upon variation of those three parameters over their default values. 

Figure 5 about here 

As  seen  from  fig.  5,  ± 25%  uncertainty  in  estimation  of  the  Adriatic  sea  water 
 
activity causes approximately -10% and +10% change in 90Sr mean residence time. This 

uncertainty  arises  from  the  fact  that  only  four  sampling  locations  were  used  for 
estimation  of  the    90Sr  activity    for  the  total  volume  of  the  Adriatic  sea.  On  the  other 
hand, the larger input of  90Sr either by fallout or by water influx from Ionian sea leads 

to smaller value for  mean residence time. 

 

As  a  consequence  of  direct  proportionality  between  strontium  input  into  the 

Adriatic sea and its mean residence time in the sea water, it can be argued that 3.3 is the 

upper  limit  of  the  Adriatic  sea  water  turnover  time.  Namely,  resuspension  from  the 
sediments could affect 90Sr activity concentrations, acting as additional input, especially 

in the northern, relatively shallow part of Adriatic. 

 
The  upper  limit  of  3.3 ± 0.4  years  of  the  Adriatic  sea  water  turnover  time, 
estimated from long term observations of  90Sr as radiotracer, is in reasonable agreement 

with the overall literature data discussed in section 1.5.

4. Conclusions 

Over  the  period  of  41  years,    90Sr  activity  concentrations  in  the  Adriatic  sea 
 
water dropped from 14.8 ± 2.4 Bq m-3 in 1963 to 2.0 ± 0.3 Bq m-3 in 2003. In the same 

period,  the  total  annual  land  surface  deposit  in  Adriatic  fell  by  three  orders  of 
magnitude, from 713.3 Bq m-2 to 0.4 Bq m-2. The Chernobyl accident did not cause any 
significant increase of in  90Sr activity concentration in sea water, as well as in most of 

the environmental samples in Croatia. 

Using  relatively  simple  mathematical  model  describing  the  rate  of  change  of   
 
90Sr activity concentrations in the Adriatic sea water, the mean residence time of   90Sr  

in  the  sea  water  was  estimated  to  be  3.3 ± 0.4  years.  However,  turnover  time  of  3.3 

years could be regarded as an upper limit averaged over the period of 40 years. As this 

value reflects the turnover time of the Adriatic sea water, for the spontaneous cleanup of 

well-mixed pollutant in Adriatic, theoretically it would take up to 3.3 years. 

This value is comparable to the literature data for the values of the Adriatic sea 

water  turnover  that  range  from  0.7  -  5  years,  obtained  by  studying  water  flows  of  the 

Adriatic sea water through the Strait of Otranto. 

As  the  90Sr  activity  concentrations  in  fallout  and  sea  water  are  approaching 

background  values,  further  improvements  in  any  model  that  would  use  radiostrontium 

as a radioactive tracer are not very realistic.

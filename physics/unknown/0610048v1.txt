While  the  invention  of  holography  by  Dennis  Gabor1,2  truly  constitutes  an 

ingenious  concept,  it  has  ever  since  been  troubled  by  the  so  called  twin  image 

problem limiting the information that can be obtained from a holographic record. 

Due  to  symmetry  reasons  there  are  always  two  images  appearing  in  the 

reconstruction process. Thus, the reconstructed object is obscured by its unwanted 

out  of  focus  twin  image.  Especially  for  emission  electron  as  well  as  for  x-  and 

gamma-ray3,4  holography,  where  the  source-object  distances  are  small,  the 

reconstructed images of atoms are very close to their twin images from which they 

can  hardly  be  distinguished.  In  some  particular  instances  only,  experimental 

efforts  could  remove  the  twin  images5,6,7.  More  recently,  numerical  methods  to 

diminish the effect of the twin image have been proposed but are limited to purely 

absorbing objects8,9,10,11,12 failing to account for phase shifts caused by the object. 

Here  we  show  a  universal  method  to  reconstruct  a  hologram  completely  free  of 

twin  images  disturbance  while  no  assumptions  about  the  object  need  to  be 

imposed.  Both,  amplitude  and  true  phase  distributions  are  retrieved  without 

distortion.

The basic setup for holography is depicted in Figure 1 together with the positions of the 

object and its twin image when an in-line hologram is reconstructed. In the object plane, 

the  twin  appears  as  an  out  of  focus  image  while  in  the  twin  image  plane  the  object 

appears  out  of  focus.  The  two  images  are  mirror-symmetric  with  respect  to  the  point 

source. In holography with visible light, the object and its twin image can be separated 

by  using  parallel  beams  and  subtracting  a  second  hologram  from  the  reconstructed 

image1,5,  by  employing  a  beam  splitter6  or  introducing  additional  lenses  into  the 

recording  and  reconstructing  scheme7.  However,  lenses  are  not  available  for  x-ray  or 

gamma-ray holography. In electron emission holography, the close proximity of source 

and sample also makes it impossible to employ lenses or a beam-splitter between them. 

In  other  schemes,  like  holography  with  low  energy  electrons  lenses  are  to  be  avoided 

due  to  their  inherent  aberrations.  Moreover,  in-line  holography  exhibits  high  phase 

sensitivity and is therefore, for coherent low energy electrons13 and even for high energy 

electrons14,  for  which  DNA  molecules  represent  extremely  weak  phase  objects,  the 

method of choice. 

The most widely employed approach to address the twin image problem is to record a 

set  of  holograms  at  different  wavelengths15,16.  However,  this  method  only  suppresses 

but  not  eliminates  the  twin  image  and  is  experimentally  difficult  to  implement  in 

particular  when  it  comes  to  record  fragile  biological  molecules  subject  to  radiation 

damage. So far numerical methods to diminish the effect of the twin image have been 

restricted to holograms of purely absorbing objects8,9,10,11,12, a coarse approximation of 

physical  reality.  In  this  letter  we  show  how  the  twin  image  can  be  eliminated  by 

numerical  reconstruction  of  a  hologram  without  imposing  any  restrictions  on  or 

assumptions about the object to be imaged.

A reference wave Aexp(ikr) where A is a complex constant and r is the radius vector to 

some  point  in  space,  propagates  from  a  point  source  towards  a  distant  screen 

illuminating it with the intensity 

A

=

B

, where rs describes a point on 

the screen, thus providing a coherent background B. If an object is placed into the beam, 

the  hologram  is  formed  at  the  screen.  It  is  brought  about  by  interference  between  the 

wave scattered by the object and the un-scattered wave. The transmission function in the 

object plane can be written as (1+t(r0)), where 1 corresponds to the transmittance in the 

absence of the object, t(r0) is a complex function describing the presence of the object 

and  r0  describes  a  point  of  the  object.  Part  of  the  beam  passes  the  object  un-scattered 

forming  the  reference  wave,  Aexp(ikr0).  The  part  of  the  beam  scattered  by  the  object 

gives rise to the object wave, Aexp(ikr0)t(r0). The total field at the screen is the sum of 

the reference and object wave A(R0(rs)+O0(rs)), where R0=exp(ikrs), and AO0(rs) is the 

object  wave  distribution  on  the  screen,  which  is  calculated  by  solving  the  Kirchhoff-

Helmholtz

 which we call the normalized hologram. It is 

2

worth noting that this normalized hologram is independent of 

2A . This is an important 

experimental  aspect  since 

2A would  vary  with  changes  in  the  point  source  intensity, 

camera  sensitivity,  image  intensity-scale  defined  by  the  image  format,  etc.  The 

4 

following  routine  is  applied  to  such  normalized  holograms  making  it  independent  of 

details of the data acquisition.  

 

The  final  goal  of  our  method  is  to  reconstruct  the  distribution  of  the  complex  sum 

(R0(rs)+O0(rs)).  This  is  achieved  by  an  iterative  procedure18,19,20  which  basically  boils 

down to the field propagation back and forth between the screen- and the object-plane, 

until all artefacts due to the twin image are gone. It includes the following steps:

, and the 

phase Ω(rs) is initially set to krs - the phase of the known reference wave R0=exp(ikrs) – 

and it evolves towards its true value during iteration. 

(ii)  Back  propagation  to  the  object  plane  is  simulated  using  the  Helmholtz-Kirchhoff 

formula17. 

(iii)  The  reconstructed  complex  field  distribution  multiplied  with  the  conjugated 

incident  wave  exp(-ikr0)  gives  the  complex  transmission  function  in  the  object  plane 

(

1

(
0rt+

) ).  The  extracted  complex  transmission  function  describes  the  object’s 

absorption  and  phase  shift  by  the  relation:

(

r

)

=

1(

−

a

(

r

))

exp(

−

(

))

,  where 

a(r0) defines the absorbing properties of the object and ϕ(r0) the phase shift introduced 

by  the  object  with  respect  to  the  incident  wave.  Thus,  due  to  the  presence  of  the 

reference wave, the correct absorption a(r0) and phase properties ϕ(r0) of the object can 

be extracted. The following constraint can be applied: a(r0)≥0, which refers to nothing 

else but the basic physical notion of energy conservation requiring that absorption may 

5 

not lead to an increased amplitude following a scattering process.  This in turn implies 

that  whenever  negative  values  of  a(r0)  emerge,  they  are  the  result  of  the  interference 

between  the  twin  image-  and  the  reference-wave,    and  are  subsequently  replaced  by 

zeros  while  the  phase  values  remain  unchanged.  Purely  based  on  this  basic  physical 

notion  of  positive  absorption  values,  we  obtain  a  constraint  to  derive  a  re-combined 

absorption  and  phase  distribution  for  the  object  leading  to  the  new  transmission 

function: 

1

('

r

)

=

1(

))

exp(

−

ϕi
(

r

))

.                               

(iv)  Next,  we  let  the  reference  wave  Aexp(ikr),  originating  from  the  point  source, 

propagate17 forward. Once it has passed the object with the new transmission function 

(

1

0rt+
('

) ) we arrive at the new complex sum 

(

R

('
0

r +
s O
)

('
0

r
s

))

  in  the  screen  plane. 

We then acquire the altered phase value from this new sum and use it as the input phase 

value for the next iteration starting at step (i). We would like to point out that the first 

iteration  already  reconstructs  the  complex  object  with  the  same  quality  as  the 

conventional hologram reconstruction routines. Further iterations eventually lead to the 

elimination of the twin term. There are no limitation on the object surrounding, object’s 

size or on the object properties being weak absorbing or weak/strong phase shifting. The 

object  and  its  surrounding  can  be  anything:  for  instance,  an  extended  biological 

molecule  which  is  identified  only  by  a  weak  phase  shift  of  the  incident  beam,  or  an 

arrangement of heavy atoms acting as point-like absorbing centres. 

 

We  now  test  the  routine,  first  with  a  simulated  hologram,  then  by  using  experimental 

holograms. A hologram of an extended object with a maximum absorption a(r0) of 80% 

of  an  incident  beam  and  a  maximum  phase  shift ϕ(r0)  of  3  radians  was  simulated  by 

6 

using the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff formula17 and reconstructed with our method described 

above.  The  results  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  The  object’s  absorption  and  phase 

distributions  obtained  by  conventional  hologram  reconstruction  routine  are  shown  in 

Figure 2b, and those obtained after the first iteration in Figure 2c. Both reconstructions 

are  similar  and  suffer  from  the  superimposed  out  of  focus  twin  image.  While  the 

reconstructed  absorption  distributions  are  almost  identical,  the  phase  distribution 

obtained by the conventional reconstruction is initially better since it shows a maximum 

phase shift of 2.5 radian (see Figure 2b). Nevertheless, it does not reach the correct pre-

defined  maximum  phase  shift  of  3  radian.  Each  further  iteration  step  causes  the  twin 

image  to  fade  away  in  the  reconstructed  absorption  distribution  while  the  phase 

distribution approaches  its  true  values.  After  the  1-st  iteration  step  the  maximal  phase 

shift amounts only 0.2 radian (see Figure 2c). However, already after the 10-th iteration 

(see  Figure  2d)  the  phase  distribution  appears  almost  free  from  the  disturbing  twin 

image  and  the  phase  values  are  recovering.  The  absorption  and  phase  distributions, 

retrieved after the 50-th iteration, shown in Figure 2e, demonstrate that the effect of the 

twin  image  has  been  completely  removed  and  the  phase  has  finally  reached  its  pre-

defined value of 3 radians. This demonstrates that the twin image removal is more than 

just getting rid of an artefact of holography; it is also a way to arrive at the true phase 

values. 

 

To  apply  our  method  to  experimental  holograms,  green  laser  light  of  532  nm 

wavelength  (Changchun  New  Industries  Optoelectronics  diode  laser)  is  focused  by 

means of a microscope objective (Newport M60, NA=0.85). At the focal point a pinhole 

of 20 µm in diameter optimises the beam to form a coherent point source. As an object a 

7 

tungsten  tip  is  then  placed  into  the  divergent  beam  and  controlled  by  a  xyz-movable 

stage.  The  distance  between  the  point  source  and  the  tip  is  adjusted  to  approximately 

0.81  mm.  A  screen  is  placed  at  about  1  m  from  the  point  source  and  the  hologram 

captured  by  a  CCD  camera  (Hamamatsu  C4742-95).  The  recorded  and  normalized 

hologram and its reconstructions are shown in Figure 3. The result after 500 iterations 

shows  that  residues  due  to  the  twin  image  in  the  reconstructed  absorption  and  phase 

distributions are gone. 

With this, a novel method to finally solve the twin image problem is established and can 

now  be  applied  without  limitations  to  wavelength  or  wave  front  shapes  (planar,  or 

spherical),  for  imaging  objects  of  arbitrary  size,  exhibiting  absorbing  and/or  phase 

shifting  properties.  From  a  single  holographic  record,  twin-image  free  true  absorption 

and phase distributions are iteratively retrieved.

Fock representations of non-centrally
extended super-diﬀeomorphism
algebras

Abstract

A class of Fock representations of non-central extensions of the
super-diﬀeomorphism algebra in (N +1|M ) dimensions is constructed,
by superization of the paper [physics/9705040]. The representations
act on trajectories in (N |M )-dimensional superspace, the extra di-
mension being the parameter along the trajectory. The restrictions
to various subalgebras are considered. In particular, the centrally ex-
tended superconformal algebra is obtained by restriction to the contact
superalgebra K(1|1). This shows that one of the basic assumptions
in superstring theory (the distinguished nature of the superconformal
algebra) is incorrect.

1 Introduction

The diﬀeomorphism group (and its algebra dif f (N +1)) in N +1-dimensional
space-time plays a crucial role in classical physics; suﬃce it to say, that local
diﬀerential geometry and general relativity may be phrased in the language
of dif f (N +1) modules and intertwiners. However, quantum ﬁeld theory

1

is only invariant under the Poincar´e group, because until recently it was
not known how to build projective dif f (N +1) Fock modules. The problem
is that normal ordering of tensor densities gives rise to inﬁnities; also, no
central extension exists when N > 0. Recall that a module is projective
if it admits a group action up to a phase; on the Lie algebra level, this
corresponds to a representation of an abelian extension of dif f (N +1). If
the phase is local, the resulting extension must transform non-trivially under
the diﬀeomorphism algebra, i.e. it is non-central. Only if the phase is globally
constant, the extension is equivalent to a central one.

The ﬁrst example of a projective Fock representation of dif f (N +1) was
found by Eswara-Rao and Moody [6]. Analogous representations of current
algebras were previously discovered by the same group [5][7][14]. Subse-
quently the present author uncovered the geometrical meaning of their con-
struction, and greatly generalized it [11]. It turns out that the algebra acts
on trajectories in space, the extra time dimension being the parameter along
the trajectory. The word is trajectory, not string, because we deal with one-
dimensional objects in space-time. It is remarkable that although space and
time are treated in a completely diﬀerent fashion, a proper dif f (N +1) re-
alization on trajectories is obtained. Because the realization is non-linear,
normal ordering gives rise to a non-central extension of dif f (N +1); the ex-
tension does distinguish between space and time. Dzhumadildaev [4] has
classiﬁed extensions of dif f (N +1) by irreducible modules (i.e. tensor densi-
ties), but only some of the extensions that I found are covered by his theorem.
The point is that it is not suﬃcient to consider irreducible modules; inter-
esting extensions also arise when we consider reducible but indecomposable
modules. One example is provided by the modules deﬁned by the relations
(3.36) and (3.37) below.

The super-diﬀeomorphism algebra dif f (N +1|M) is the algebra of ﬁrst-
order diﬀerential operators in (N +1|M)-dimensional super space-time (alter-
native names: algebra of super vector ﬁelds vect(N +1|M), generalized Witt
algebra W (N +1|M)). The classical representations of this algebra and its
various subalgebras have been worked out in several papers [3][9][10][12][13].
For information about its bosonic counterpart, see e.g.
[8][17]. Some su-
peralgebras possess a central extension [1][2][15][16]; for a classiﬁcation see
[9].

The purpose of the present paper is to superize the construction in [11]. It
turns out that dif f (N +1|M) has the same type of projective Fock represen-

2

tations as dif f (N +1); superization simply amounts to a judiscious insertion
of minus signs. After some preliminaries in section 2, the main theorem is
given in section 3. We prove that there is a classical realization on trajec-
tories in theorem 3.1, and then normal order to describe the extension in
theorem 3.4. Section 4 is devoted to subalgebras of dif f (N +1|M). Clearly,
for every subalgebra h ∈ dif f (N +1|M), we obtain by restriction a Fock rep-
resentation of an extension of h. In general this extension is non-central, but
under special circumstances it may reduce to a central extension (or even no
extension at all). In this way the centrally extended super-conformal algebra
is obtained. This means that the common belief that there is an excep-
tional algebraic structure underlying string theory is simply wrong. Section
5 contains a brief statement of the corresponding representations for gauge
superalgebras, i.e. the higher-dimensional analog of the Kac-Moody super-
algebra.

2 Preliminaries

Consider a superalgebra g with basis J a, where deg J a ≡ deg a = 0 if a
is even (bosonic) and deg a = 1 if a is odd (fermionic). Let the symbol
(−)a = (−1)deg a. These symbols satisfy an algebra modulo 2: a2 = a,
2a = 0. A superalgebra satisﬁes the condition of graded skewness,

[J a, J b] = −(−)ab[J b, J a],

(2.1)

and the super-Jacobi identity,

(−)ac[J a, [J b, J c]] + (−)ba[J b, [J c, J a]] + (−)bc[J c, [J a, J a]] = 0.

(2.2)

In terms of structure constants, the brackets are

[J a, J b] = if ab

(2.8)

Consider (N +1|M)-dimensional super space-time with coordinates xµ
and partial derivatives ∂µ = ∂/∂xµ, where greek indices µ, ν = 0, 1, .., N, N +
1, ..N + M, deg xµ = deg ∂µ = deg µ. The coordinate t ≡ x0 is called
time. Further, we use latin indices i, j = 1, .., N, N + 1, ..N + M for (N|M)-
dimensional superspace, excluding the time label 0. Let the ﬁrst N +1 coor-
dinates be bosonic (including time), and let the remaining M coordinates be
fermionic. Thus, deg µ = 0, µ = 0, 1, .., N and deg µ = 1, µ = N +1, .., N +M.
Let (−)µ = (−1)deg µ. The notation is consistent because time is bosonic:

4

(−)0 = 1. To this super space-time we associate a super-Heisenberg algebra
with generators qµ and pν, satisfying

[pν, qµ] = δµ
ν ,

[qµ, qν] = [pµ, pν] = 0.

(2.9)

Note that the brackets are graded: [qµ, pν] = (−)µν[pν, qµ].

There are two independent central charges k1 and k2, because gl(N +1|M) ∼=
sl(N +1|M) ⊕ gl(1).

The special subalgebra sl(N +1|M) consists of operators satisfying T µ
µ ≡
0. The fundamental representations are as in (2.11), except that κ = 0. The
sl(N +1|M) has only one independent central extension,
Kac-Moody algebra
and the brackets are as in (2.12) with k1 = −(N + 1 − M)k2.

\

The super-diﬀeomorphism algebra dif f (N +1|M) is the algebra of ﬁrst-
order diﬀerential operators (i.e. vector ﬁelds) in (N +1|M)-dimensional super
space-time. Locally, such a vector ﬁeld takes the form ξ = ξµ(x)∂µ. The
brackets read

[ξ, η] = ξµ∂µην∂ν − (−)ξηην∂νξµ∂µ = −(−)ξη[η, ξ]

(2.13)

The divergence of a vector ﬁeld is is

dif f (N +1|M) has generators Lξ and brackets

div ξ = (−)ξµ+µ∂µξµ.

[Lξ, Lη] = L[ξ,η].

(2.14)

(2.15)

The classical representations are tensor densities, corresponding to the fol-
lowing expression for Lξ.

Lξ = ξµ(q)pµ + (−)(ξ+µ)ν+µ∂νξµ(q)T ν
µ ,

(2.16)

where the T µ
that (2.15) is satisﬁed. The representations inherited from (2.11) are

ν satisfy gl(N +1|M) (2.10). One shows by direct calculation

[Lξ, Φν(x)] = −ξµ(x)∂µΦν(x) + (−)(ξ+ν)µ+ν ∂µξν(x)Φµ(x),
[Lξ, Φν(x)] = −ξµ(x)∂µΦν(x) − (−)ξν+µ+ν∂νξµ(x)Φµ(x),
[Lξ, Φ(x)] = −ξµ∂µΦ(x) − κdiv ξ(x)Φ(x),

(2.17)

respectively. We sometimes need a alternative version of (2.17), acting on
Ψν = (−)νΦν and Ψν = (−)νΦν.

[Lξ, Ψν(x)] = −ξµ(x)∂µΨν(x) + (−)(ξ+ν+µ)µ∂µξν(x)Ψµ(x),
[Lξ, Ψν(x)] = −ξµ(x)∂µΨν(x) − (−)ξν∂νξµ(x)Ψµ(x).

(2.18)

The actions on a general tensor densities can be obtained by tensoring, if we
keep the extra signs in mind. Thus, if Φ(x) and Ψ(x) are two ﬁelds (with
indices suppressed),

[Lξ, Φ(x) ⊗ Ψ(x)] = [Lξ, Φ(x)] ⊗ Ψ(x) + (−)ξΦΦ(x) ⊗ [Lξ, Ψ(x)]

(2.19)

Explicitly, the transformation law for a tensor ﬁeld, with all upper indices
placed in front of the lower ones, reads

[Lξ, Φσ1...σp

τ1...τq(x)] = −ξµ(x)∂µΦσ1...σp

contraction of higher tensors is deﬁned analogously, but care has to be taken
with signs for non-adjascent indices. A tensor is graded symmetric in two
adjascent upper indices if Φνµ(x) = (−)µνΦµν(x) and graded skewsymmetric
if Φνµ(x) = −(−)µν Φµν(x). For any set of smearing functions f τ1...τq

3 Realization on trajectories

A trajectory in (N|M)-dimensional superspace is simply a vector-valued
function of time, qi(t), which satisﬁes the graded Heisenberg algebra together
with its canonically conjugate momentum pj(t).

[pj(s), qi(t)] = δi

jδ(s − t),

[qi(s), qj(t)] = [pi(s), pj(t)] = 0.

(3.1)

By diﬀerentiating with respect to t, we obtain the useful relation

[pj(s), ˙qi(t)] = −δi
j

˙δ(s − t).

The trajectories may formally be extended to super space-time, by deﬁn-

ing time components q0(t) and p0(t) as

q0(t) = t,

p0(t) = − ˙qi(t)pi(t).

Clearly, deg q0 = deg p0 = 0. The oscillators qµ(t) = (q0(t), qi(t)) and pν(t) =
(p0(t), pj(t)) satisfy the following algebra.

(3.2)

(3.3)

[pν(s), qµ(t)] = (δµ

ν ˙qµ(s))δ(s − t),

[pµ(s), pν(t)] =

µpν(s) + δ0
δ0

νpµ(t)

˙δ(s − t).

(3.4)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

Note that p0(t) satisfy dif f (1) (2.7), and that ˙q0(t) = 1, ¨q0(t) = ˙qµ(t)pµ(t) =
0. Eq. (3.4) is formally the same as in the bosonic case. The only place where
the super nature of these relations enter is that the brackets are graded, e.g.

[qµ(t), pν(s)] = (−)µν[pν(s), qµ(t)].

(3.5)

It follows that

[pµ(s), f (q(t))] = (∂µf (q(t)) − δ0
µ

˙f (q(t)))δ(s − t).

(3.6)

R

We assume that super space-time is periodic in the temporal direction. This
dt ˙f(t) = 0 for every (operator-valued) function; in particular,
means that
dt ˙θ(t) =
dθ1 = 0 can be interpreted as a
if θ is a fermionic coordinate,
property of the Berezin integral. Moreover, every function can be expanded
in a Fourier series. The algebra (3.4) has a natural Fock module, which is
obtained from the universal envelopping algebra by introducing a vacuum
which is annihilated by all negative frequency modes.

Then the following expression provides a realization of dif f (N +1|M).

τ1...τq(t) a primary trajectory ﬁeld of type P(λ, ω; κ, p, q). The

[Lξ, qν(t)] = ξν(q(t)) − ξ0(q(t)) ˙qν(t).

(3.9)

Its time derivative is a primary trajectory ﬁeld of type P(1, 0; 0, 1, 0). From

[Lξ, ˙qν(t)] = (−)µ(µ+ξ+ν)∂µξν(q(t)) ˙qµ(t)− ˙ξ0(q(t)) ˙qν(t)−ξ0(q(t))¨qν(t), (3.10)

it follows that (−)ν ˙qν(t) transforms as in (3.8).

To understand the meaning of theorem 3.1, consider its restriction to the

spatial subalgebra generated by time-independent vector ﬁelds.

Lξ =

Z

dt ξi(~q(t))pi(t) + (−)(ξ+i)j+i∂jξi(~q(t))T j

i (t)

(3.11)

This is recognized as the action of inﬁnitesimal diﬀeomorphisms on extended
objects in superspace. There is no need here to limit ourselves to one-
dimensional objects; t could very well have several components. From the
algebraic point of view, this action is highly reducible; in fact, for every value
of t we have an independent tensor density (2.16), and thus (3.11) describes
a continuous direct sum of tensor densities.

However, for one-dimensional extended objects two miracles occur. First,
we can extend the action to (N +1|M)-dimensional super space-time by
means of (3.7). Now t must be one-dimensional because the time deriva-
tive appears, both in p0(t) = − ˙qi(t)pi(t) and in the right-hand side of (2.7).
This realization is no longer obviously reducible, although it still is reducible

9

in a more subtle manner. For a trajectory ﬁeld of type P(1, ω; κ, p, q) and
smearing functions f τ1...τq

σ1...σp(x), deﬁne

φ(f ) =

Z

dt f τ1...τq

σ1...σp(q(t))φσ1...σp

τ1...τq(t).

(3.12)

It can be shown that φ(f ) transforms in the same fashion as Φ(f ) (2.21),
provided that Φ(x) has the weight κ−1. This phenomenon, which was called
correspondance in [11], implies that this type of trajectory ﬁeld contains a
tensor ﬁeld subrealization.

The second miracle is that one-dimensional objects admit normal order-
ing, which gives rise to a superalgebra extension. We now proceed to calculate
it. Split the delta function into positive and negative energy parts.

The result now follows by means of lemma 3.3. As a consistency check we
note that the extension satisﬁes ext(η, ξ) = −(−)ξηext(ξ, η). 2

The superalgebra described in this theorem is not a Lie superalgebra,
because the right-hand side is not linear in qµ(t). Rather, it is a graded
associative algebra, and the bracket must be interpreted as the graded com-
mutator. However, it is easy to rewrite the extension in linear form, by
introducing a suﬃcient number of new generators. We then obtain an ab-
stract Lie superalgebra extension of dif f (N +1|M).

Let h = hµ1..µn(x)dxµ1 ◦ .. ◦ dxµn be a graded symmetric n-tensor and let

g = gµ(x)dxµ be a one-tensor. Deﬁne the operators

of the minus signs. Deﬁne kernels Sν1..νn

4 Subalgebras

A projective representation of dif f (N +1|M) yields by restriction a projec-
tive representation of its subalgebras, i.e. superalgebras whose generators
admit a realization as ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators on super space-time.
Such algebras are described in [3][9]. The bosonic case is classical, and can
be found e.g. in [8].

4.1 Temporal subalgebra dif f (1)

The temporal subalgebra is generated by space-independent vector ﬁelds ξ =
ξ0(t)∂0. Eq. (3.21) becomes

Lξ =

dt ξ0(t)(−: ˙qi(t)pi(t) : + L(t)) + ˙ξ0(t)T 0

where

L′(t) ≡ −: ˙qi(t)pi(t) : + L(t) − ˙T 0

generates a Virasoro algebra. The extension (3.23) is

c + 2(N − M)

Hence the temporal subalgebra is a Virasoro algebra with central charge
cT emp = c + 2(N − M) + 12(k1 + k2).

4.2

Spatial subalgebra dif f (N |M)

The spatial subalgebra is generated by time-independent vector ﬁelds ξ =
ξi(~x)∂i. The arrow denotes a vector with spatial components only; ~x0 = 0.
Using that ξ0 = ∂0ξi = 0, we ﬁnd

Lξ =

Special superdiﬀeomorphism algebra sdif f (N +1|M)

It can be shown that the divergence (2.14) of a vector ﬁeld satisﬁes

div ([ξ, η]) = ξµ∂µ div η − (−)ξηην∂ν div ξ.

(4.6)

The special (or divergence-free) algebra sdif f (N +1|M) is generated by vec-
tor ﬁelds with vanishing divergence. In theorems 3.1 and 3.4, the matrices
T µ
ν (t) ∈ sl(N +1|M), and hence k1 = (N − M + 1)k2 in (2.12). The extension

4.4 Hamiltonian algebras H(N +1|M) and H(N |M)

The Hamiltionian algebra H(N +1|M) preserves the constant graded skew-
symmetric matrix ωστ , satisfying

ωτ σ = −(−)στ ωστ

(4.8)

Actually, it is suﬃcient if ωστ (x) is a closed two-form, but we do not need
this generalization here, because it is always possible to choose Darboux
coordinates locally. However, it would be necessary for global considerations.
Deﬁne the inverse matrix ωµν by

ωµρωρν = (−)µδµ
ν ,

(−)ρωνρωρµ = δµ
ν

(4.9)

19

In general, a two-form transforms as

[Lξ, ωστ (x)] = −ξµ∂µωστ (x) − (−)ξσ+σ+µ∂σξµωµτ (x)

−(−)ξτ +τ +µ+σ(µ+τ )∂τ ξµωσµ(x).

(4.10)

The matrix ωστ can be regarded as a constant two-form, provided ξ is a
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld of the form

ξ = Hf ≡ (−)f µ+ν∂µf (x)ωµν∂ν,

(4.11)

for f an arbitary function. Such vector ﬁelds generate the Hamiltonian alge-
bra H(N +1|M) ⊂ dif f (N +1|M). It is easy to verify that (4.11) and (4.10)
imply that [Lξ, ωστ (x)] = 0, and that

[Hf , Hg] = H{f,g}P.b.,
{f, g}P.b. = (−)f µ+ν ∂µf ωµν∂νg.

(4.12)

{·, ·}P.b. is called the Poisson bracket. It satisﬁes the axioms of a Lie super-
algebra, acting as a derivation of the associative product.

{g, f }P.b. = (−)f g{f, g}P.b.
{f, gh}P.b. = {f, g}P.b. h + (−)f gg{f, h}P.b.
(−)f h{f, {g, h}P.b.}P.b. + (−)f g{g, {h, f }P.b.}P.b.

+(−)gh{h, {f, g}P.b.}P.b. = 0.

(4.13)

Conventionally, one sets ωµν = 0 if deg µ + deg ν = 1. However, it is only
necessary to demand that ωµν be a Grassmann (anti-commuting) number in
this case. It appears that by choosing ωµν purely Grassmann, the Leitesian
algebra [12], [9], i.e. the odd analogue of the Hamiltonian algebra, is obtained.

Inserting (4.11) into (3.21) yields the following realization

L(Hf ) =

dt (−)f µ+ν: ∂µf (q(t))ωµνpν(t) :

(4.14)

Z
+(−)f µ∂µf (q(t))ωµ0L(t) + (−)f (µ+ρ)+νρ∂ρ∂µf (q(t))ωµνT ρ

ν (t).

We have deg Hf = deg f and H µ

f = (−)f σ+µ∂σf ωσµ. Moreover,

div (Hf ) = (−)f ν+ν+f µ+ν∂ν∂µf ωµν = 0.

(4.15)

20

The generators in (4.14) satisfy an extended Hamiltonian algebra,

[L(Hf ), L(Hg)] = L(H{f,g}P.b.) + ext(f, g),

(4.16)

where the extension is obtained by specialization of (3.23).

The dimensions in the Hamiltonian algebra appear in pairs: a coordinate
and its conjugate momentum. Since time is a distinguished dimension, it
is natural to consider matrices satisfying ω0ν = 0, and time-independent
functions. This leads to considerable simpliﬁcations.

4.5 Contact algebra K(N +1|M)

Denote the Euler operator E = xi∂i and ∆ = 2 − E. Clearly, deg ∆ =
deg E = deg ∂0 = 0. The contact algebra K(N +1|M) is

[Kf , Kg] = K{f,g}K.b.,

(4.22)

(4.17)

(4.18)
(4.19)

(4.20)

where

{f, g}K.b. = ∆(f (x))∂0g(x) − ∂0f (x)∆(g(x)) − {f, g}P.b.,

(4.23)

and the Poisson bracket is given by (4.18). {·, ·}K.b. is called the contact
bracket. It satisﬁes the axioms of a Lie superalgebra, but it is not a derivation
of the associative product, due to an extra term.

{g, f }K.b. = (−)f g{f, g}K.b.
{f, gh}K.b. = {f, g}K.b. h + (−)f gg{f, h}K.b. + 2∂0f gh
(−)f h{f, {g, h}K.b.}K.b. + (−)f g{g, {h, f }K.b.}K.b.

+(−)gh{h, {f, g}K.b.}K.b. = 0.

(4.24)

To verify that (4.23) deﬁnes a Lie algebra, the following formulas are useful.

∂0∆ = ∆∂0

∆{f, g}P.b. = {∆f, g}P.b. + {f, ∆g}P.b.
∆(f g) = ∆(f )g + f ∆(g) − 2f g

(4.25)

K(N +1|M) is realized by contact vector ﬁelds

Kf = ∆(f (x))∂0 − Hf + ∂0f (x)E

(4.26)

which is veriﬁed by direct computation. The components are

K 0
K i

f (x) = ∆(f (x))
f (x) = −H i

f (x) + ∂0f (x)xi,

(4.27)

where

H i

f (x) = (−)f k+i∂kf (x)ωki.
The realization on trajectories is now obtained by substituting (4.27) into
(3.21), and making the replacements ∂0 7→ p0(t) = − ˙qi(t)pi(t), E 7→ qi(t)pi(t).
We ﬁnd

(4.28)

L(Kf ) =

where f (t) = f (q(t)), H i
f (q(t)). The extension can be computed
from (4.27) and (3.23), but the calculations are tedious and the result is not
very illuminating.

f (t) = H i

Actually, there are two diﬀerent notions of time in our representation
of the contact algebra: one is treated specially in (3.21) and the other in
(4.23). Although it is natural to identify these two times, as we have done
above, this is not necessary. A more general representation of extended
K(N +1|M) is obtained as follows. Introduce ﬁxed constant vectors zµ and
zµ with components only in the bosonic directions, satisfying

The case above is recovered when zµ = δ0

zµzµ = 1,

zµωµν = 0.
µ, zµ = δµ

0 . Then

E = xµ∂µ − zµxµzν∂ν,

∆ = 2 − E

(4.30)

{f, g}K.b. = ∆(f (x))zµ∂µg(x) − zµ∂µf (x)∆(g(x)) − {f, g}P.b.

Kf = ∆(f (x))zµ∂µ − Hf + zµ∂µf (x)E,

(4.31)

where the Poisson bracket is given by (4.12) and Hf by (4.11). The action
in Fock space is given by

L(Kf ) =

where f (t) ≡ f (q(t)).

Superconformal algebra

As is known [9], the superconformal algebra is a central extension of the
contact algebra K(1|1). Denote t = x0 and θ = x1, deg t = 0, deg θ = 1. A
Fourier basis for functions in (1|1) dimensions is given by

ℓm =

eimt,

gm = θeimt.

(4.33)

Let ω11 = i be the only non-zero component of the matrix ωµν. The Poisson
brackets are

{θ, θ}P.b. = i,

{t, t}P.b. = {t, θ}P.b. = 0.

(4.34)

With ∆ = 2−θ∂θ, we have ∆(ℓm) = 2ℓm, ∆(gm) = gm. The functions ℓm and
gm generate a centerless superconformal algebra under the contact bracket
(4.23).

The corresponding contact vector ﬁelds are

{ℓm, ℓn}K.b. = (n − m)ℓm+n

{ℓm, gn}K.b. = (n −

The central charge of (4.41) is 12a = −11 + 9k1 + 3k2 + c. Hence we have
constructed a representation of the superconformal algebra for each V ir ⋉
gl(1|1) module.
It is possible to make the projection θm = 0, Um = δm
in (4.39), because this choice makes these operators central. A motivation
comes from the Berezin integral:

dt ˙θ(t)θ(t) ≈

dθθ = 1.

4.7 M = 2 superconformal algebra

The superconformal algebra with two supersymmetries is a central extension
of the contact algebra K(1|2). The coordinates are t = x0, θ = x1, ¯θ = x2,
deg t = 0, deg θ = deg ¯θ = 1. A Fourier basis for functions in (1|2) dimensions
is given by

ℓm =

eimt,

1
2i
gm = θeimt,

tm = iθ ¯θeimt
¯gm = ¯θeimt.

(4.43)

Let ω12 = i be the only non-zero component of the matrix ωµν. The Poisson
brackets are

{θ, ¯θ}P.b. = i,
{θ, θ}P.b. = {¯θ, ¯θ}P.b. = {t, t}P.b. = {t, θ}P.b. = {t, ¯θ}P.b. = 0. (4.44)

26

Moreover, ∆ = 2 − θ∂θ − ¯θ∂¯θ and
∆(ℓm) = 2ℓm,
∆(gm) = gm,

∆(tm) = 0
∆(¯gm) = ¯gm.

(4.45)

The functions ℓm, gm, ¯gm and tm generate a centerless M = 2 superconformal
algebra under the contact bracket (4.23).

{ℓm, ℓn}K.b. = (n − m)ℓm+n
{ℓm, tn}K.b. = ntm+n

{tm, ¯gn}K.b. = −¯gm,

The corresponding contact vector ﬁelds are

K(ℓm) = eimt(−i∂t +
K(gm) = eimt(θ∂t − i∂¯θ + imθ ¯θ∂¯θ)
K(¯gm) = eimt(¯θ∂t − i∂θ − imθ ¯θ∂θ)
K(tm) = eimt(θ∂θ − ¯θ∂¯θ).

(4.46)

(4.47)

Substitution of these vector ﬁelds into (3.21) yields a Fock representation
of an extension of K(1|2). The extension is readily found from (3.23). We
have not explicitly calculated it, since the calculation is quite tedious and the
result is not very illuminating. However, by analogy with the M = 1 case, we
expect that the resulting non-central extension has a subalgebra isomorphic
to the standard centrally extended M = 2 superconformal algebra.

where ξY = ξµ(x)∂µY (x).

6 Discussion

To conclude, I have discovered a class of non-central extensions of the super-
diﬀeomorphism and super-gauge algebras in any number of bosonic and
fermionic dimensions, and constructed Fock representations thereof. To my
knowledge this is the ﬁrst time non-central extensions of Lie superalgebras
have been described.

The superconformal algebra was believed to be an exceptional algebraic
structure, because it is one of the few superalgebras admitting a central ex-
tension (an exhaustive list is given in [9]). However, the interesting property,
both mathematically and physically, is that an algebra has projective Fock

28

representations, not that the resulting extension necessarily be central. In
subsection 4.6 I proved that the superconformal algebra is not exceptional at
all, but rather a quite ordinary (and indeed one of the simplest) subalgebras
of the non-centrally extended super-diﬀeomorphism algebra.

This result has some bearing on string theory. Since there is no com-
pelling experimental evidence in favour of string theory, the only motivation
has been that it represents an exceptional mathematical structure. However,
the present paper shows that there is nothing special about the underlying
algebraic structure, the superconformal algebra, and hence I ﬁnd it diﬃcult
to believe that string theory should be relevant to physics. Stated diﬀerently:
the superconformal algebra is merely a subalgebra of the non-centrally ex-
tended super-diﬀeomorphism algebra in the lowest possible dimension.
It
seems unlikely that Nature should prefer such a trivial symmetry at her
most fundamental level.

Another motivation for string theory is that it may provide a consistent
theory of quantum gravity. Fortunately, dif f (N +1) can achieve the same
goal, in the following sense. Its Fock modules are projectively generally co-
variant (the gravity property), they are Fock spaces with energy bounded
from below (the quantum property), and all matrix elements of normal or-
dered operators are manifestly ﬁnite (the consistency property). Moreover, I
showed in [11] that trajectory analogs of the Einstein and geodesic equations
are well deﬁned, thus making the connection to Einsteinian gravity closer.

Finally, there is also a philosophical motivation for studying space-time
diﬀeomorphisms. Namely, from a passive point of view, a diﬀeomorphism is
simply a coordinate transformation. Because every physical object must be
invariantly deﬁned, rather than being an artifact of the choice of coordinate
system, it must transform consistently under arbitrary space-time diﬀeomor-
phisms, i.e. as a representation. This also contains information about the
dynamics, since the Hamiltonian is itself a space-time diﬀeomorphism; it is
the generator of rigid time translations. Thus, the dif f (N +1) representation
theory amounts to a classiﬁcation of all physical objects. A list of unitary
irreps is urgently needed.

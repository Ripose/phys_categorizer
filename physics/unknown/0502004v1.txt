Abstract 

 
The concept of nonradiative dielectric resonator is generalized in order to include axially 
open  configurations  having  rotational  invariance.  The  resulting  additional  nonradiative 
conditions are established for the different resonance modes on the basis of their azimuthal 
modal  index.  An  approximate  chart  of  the  allowed  dielectric  and  geometrical  parameters 
for  the  TE011  mode  is  given.  A  practical  realization  of  the  proposed  device  based  on 
commercial  fused  quartz  tubes  is  demonstrated  at  millimeter  wavelengths,  together  with 
simple  excitation  and  tuning  mechanisms.  The  observed  resonances  are  characterized  in 
their  basic  parameters,  as  well  as  in  the  field  distribution  by  means  of  a  finite  element 
method. The predictions of the theoretical analysis are well confirmed, both in the general 
behaviour  and  in  the  expected  quality  factors.  The  resulting  device,  in  which  the  sample 
holder  acts  itself  as  single-mode  resonating  element,  combines  an  extreme  ease  of 
realization  with  state-of-the-art  performances.  The  general  benefits  of  the  proposed  open 
single-mode resonators are finally discussed.

1. Introduction 

 
The search for efficient millimeter-wave components as waveguides, directional couplers, 
mirrors,  gratings,  non-reciprocal  elements  (circulators,  faraday  rotators)  and  resonators 
have been stimulated by the recent development of versatile solid-state sources. Among the 
above  components,  the  resonators  play  a  fundamental  role  in  each  spectroscopic 
application, due to the increase of the electromagnetic energy density on the sample and to 
an effective decoupling of the field distribution from the employed propagation circuit. At 
millimeter  wavelengths  the  commonly  employed  resonant  devices  can  be  divided  in 
overmoded  resonators,  like  Fabry-Perot  cavities  [1,  2]  and  whispering  gallery  mode 
dielectric resonators [3], and single-mode ones, as the well-known TE011 cylindrical cavity 
[4]. The single-mode resonators are accredited of higher power-to-field conversion factors, 
due  to  their  minimal  active  volume.  In  turn  they  should  guarantee  the  highest  absolute 
sensitivity  in  any  application  where  the  intensity  of  the  electric  or  magnetic  field  on  the 
sample is the key parameter. Specific efforts have been then devoted to the development of 
efficient  millimeter-wave  single-mode  resonators  [5-7].  The  most  problematic  issues  to 
face  in  this  case  are  given  by  the  size  of  the  resonator,  which  is  of  the  order  of  the 
employed  wavelength,  and  by  the  excitation  configuration.  The  commonly  proposed 
solutions, typically borrowed from the microwave technology, are indeed rather difficult to 
be realized when the wavelength approaches to the millimeter. As an example, the typical 
size of the coupling hole of a TE011 cavity working at 100 GHz is of about 0.8 mm. The 
corresponding thickness of the cavity wall around this hole must be typically less than 0.05 
mm  [5].  The  common  requirement  of  sample  manipulation  inside  the  cavity  or  of  its 
additional irradiation can complicate further on the design and the realization of the cavity, 
leading  to  performances  severely  reduced  in  comparison  to  the  ideal  ones.  An  important 
application  where  the  above  aspects  are  of  particular  relevance  is  given  by  Electron 
Paramagnetic  Resonance  (EPR)  spectroscopy,  which  often  requires  the  rotation  of  the 
sample  and  the  use  of  open  cavities,  in  order  to  allow  a  proper  static  magnetic  field 
modulation  as  well  as  radiofrequency  or  optical  excitation  [6,  8,  9].  A  relevant  EPR 
research  activity  is  in  particular  addressed  towards  high  magnetic  fields,  where  the 
working  wavelengths  approach  and  cross  the  submillimeter  borderline  [1,  9-12].  For  a 
proper development of millimeter and submillimeter wave single-mode resonators a novel 
approach  seems  then  mandatory.  A  recent  proposal  of  single-mode  dielectric  resonators 
specifically  designed  for  millimeter-wave  applications  is  reported  in  Refs.  [13,  14].  The 
room  temperature  state-of-the-art  conversion  efficiency  has  been  obtained  in  a  simple 
structure by using a partially open NonRadiative (NR) configuration. The same principle 
has been extended to metallic resonators, allowing the realization of a widely open TE011 
cavity [15]. In this reference the possibility of open resonators which combine the benefits 
of both metallic cavities and dielectric resonators was anticipated. The present paper is a 
further step along this research line, in which the concept of NR resonator is generalized in 
order to include axially open configurations. In particular, the analysis will focus on single-
mode  resonances  in  arbitrarily  long  dielectric  tubes  partially  shielded  by  conducting 
mirrors. In these structures the active region of the resonator can be given by a section of 
the  sample  holder  itself.  The  final  aim  of  the  paper  is  the  demonstration  of  open  single-
mode  resonators  having  a  peculiar  ease  of  realization  combined  to  state-of-the-art 
performances at millimeter wavelengths. The proposed solutions will be analyzed having 
in  mind  possible  applications  to  millimeter-wave  EPR  spectroscopy.  Accordingly,  the 
performances  of  the  resonators  will  be  evaluated  in  terms  of  their  magnetic  field 
conversion factor.  

The  plan  of  the  paper  is  the  following.  Sect.  2  will  discuss  the  physical  background 
underlying the realization of a proper axially open NR resonator. The global NR conditions 

 

2

will be established; the related chart of allowed dielectric and geometrical parameters will 
be given for the TE011 mode. In Sect. 3 a practical realization of the proposed device, based 
on a commercial fused quartz tube, will be investigated at millimeter wavelengths. Possible 
tuning  mechanisms  will  be  demonstrated  as  well.  The  expected  field  distributions, 
calculated by using a finite element numerical method, will be presented in Sect. 4. Finally, 
Sect. 5 will be dedicated to the analysis of the experimental and computational results, and 
of their implications. 

 

2. General aspects 

 
The peculiarity of a NR device is given by its partially open structure, where a region of 
allowed propagation is surrounded by a (partially open) region of forbidden propagation. A 
simple  application  of  this  principle  is  given  by  the  NR  dielectric  resonator  [13],  which 
indeed arose as a logical development of the firstly proposed NR waveguide [16, 17]. Figs. 
1a  and  1b  show  a  cylindrical  version  of  NR  resonator,  in  which  a  small  central  hole  is 
included in order to contain the sample. Here the metallic shielding is given by two plane 
and parallel mirrors, whose distance is indicated with l. When the diameter of the dielectric 
disc is of the order of l, the working condition of the resonator can be written as

where 
0λ  is the wavelength in vacuum corresponding to the resonance frequency and  ε 
the permittivity of the dielectric region. Under the above conditions the central region can 
contain a resonance mode. The surrounding propagation can be only due to the cutoff-less 
TEM mode, being the parallel-plates TE and TM modes below their cutoff. Any resonance 
mode  having  negligible  projection  on  the  TEM  mode  is  thus  expected  unaffected  by 
irradiation  losses,  provided  that  the  extension  of  the  mirrors  is  wide  enough.  This 
conclusion  was  experimentally  verified  on  the  HE111,  TE011  and  TM011  modes  of 
cylindrical NR dielectric resonators in Refs. [13, 14]. The presence of nonradiating modes 
can  be  argued  for  more  general  configurations  on  the  basis  of  rigorous  symmetry 
considerations.  Indeed,  transverse-electric  modes  with  azimuthal  invariance,  hereafter 
referred  to  as  TE0  modes,  are  compatible  with  any  configuration  having  rotational 
symmetry, as discussed in [15]. The TE0 modes don’t share any field component with the 
parallel-plates  TEM  mode  (characterized  only  by  axial  electric  field  and  azimuthal 
magnetic field), so at least a nonradiating mode family is expected for any configuration 
fulfilling  the  above  symmetry  property.  A  simple  excitation  configuration  of  these 
resonators  can  be  obtained  exploiting  their  nonradiative  character,  as  discussed  in  Ref. 
[13].  A  radiation  incident  on  the  NR  structure  is  indeed  totally  reflected  when  its 
polarization is parallel to the conducting mirrors, provided that the employed wavelength 
satisfies  the  NR  condition.  Only  an  evanescent  field  can  extend  inside  the  mirrors;  this 
field can transfer energy to the resonator when overlapped with the field of the resonance 
mode.  Once  the  working  frequency  and  the  distance  between  the  mirrors  are  fixed,  the 
basic  parameter  that  imposes  the  level  of  coupling  is  given  by  the  distance  between  the 
incoming radiation and the dielectric region. This parameter can be changed for instance 
by  moving  the  NR  device  orthogonally  to  the  incoming  radiation,  as  indicated  by  the 
dashed line of Fig. 1a [13, 14].  

The basic NR configuration reported in Figs. 1a and 1b can be modified as shown in Fig. 
1c, in which the central dielectric disc is replaced by a nominally infinite dielectric tube. 
The  rotational  invariance  ensures  the  confinement  of  the  TE011  mode  along  the  planar 
aperture,  according  to  the  above  NR  analysis.  A  planar  confinement  is  expected  for  the 
HE111 and TM011 modes as well, being the general conditions of symmetry unchanged. The 
new structure can behave as a proper resonator when the propagation along the dielectric 

 

3

tube  is  prevented.  The  analysis  of  this  propagation  can  be  based  again  on  general 
considerations, in which the symmetry of the structure plays a central role. The resonator 
can be considered as composed by a central dielectric region in contact with two metallic 
waveguides partially filled with a dielectric tube. Following the arguing developed for the 
NR  configuration,  a  resonance  mode  remains  confined  in  the  central  region  when  its 
projection  on  the  modes  propagating  along  the  partially  filled  metallic  waveguides 
vanishes.  The  modes  propagating  along  these  waveguides  can  be  identified  by  a  pair  of 
indices (n,m), namely an azimuthal index n and a radial index m, due to the axial symmetry 
of the structure. The symmetry ensures again that only modes having the same azimuthal 
index  can  couple  to  each  other  [18].  As  a  consequence,  the  analysis  of  the  confinement 
properties will involve only resonant modes of the central region and propagating modes in 
the adjacent waveguides having the same index n. In the following the different number of 
modal indices will discriminate between resonant modes and propagating modes.

The most important mode of any NR structure is given, as discussed above, by the TE011 
mode.  The  azimuthally  invariant  counterpart  of  the  metallic  waveguide,  assumed  here 
homogeneously filled with a dielectric material, is given by the TE0m family [4, 19]. The 
TE011  mode  doesn’t  share  indeed  any  field  component  with  the  other  family  of  modes 
having vanishing azimuthal index, namely the TM0m family. The cutoff frequencies of the

In order to verify the compatibility of this constraint with Eq. (1), we can go back to the 
basic  structure  of  Fig.  1b.  The  meaning  of  Eq.  (2)  can  be  first  investigated  on  this  test 
configuration. The differences with a true axially open resonator will be discussed later on. 
In  order  to  model  a  realistic  NR  resonator,  the  mirrors  will  be  assumed  made  of 
aluminium, whose resistivity is equal to 2.8 µΩcm. The loss factor  tanδ of the dielectric 
; its permittivity will be varied from 2 to 11. The 
region will be assumed equal to 
resonance  frequency  of  the  TE011  mode  will  be  fixed  to  91.11  GHz.  The  reason  of  these 
somehow  arbitrary  choices  will  be  cleared  up  in  the  experimental  section.  The  dielectric 
disc  will  be  assumed  without  central  hole  for  sake  of  simplicity.  By  using  the  above 
parameters, the resonance frequency, the field distribution and the merit factor Q0 of any 
mode of the resonator of Fig. 1b can be calculated following the approach of Ref. [13]. In

pair (l, r2) imposed by resonance frequency and dielectric permittivity. The curves obtained

which the lowest cutoff frequency of the metallic waveguides is lower than the resonance 
frequency of the TE011 mode. The transformation from the geometry of Fig. 1b to that Fig. 
1c  is  expected  to  leave  this  mode  confined  in  the  resonator  for  any  point  of  the  allowed 
region of Fig. 2, at least under the (unphysical) assumption that this transformation doesn’t 
modify its resonance frequency.

In  a  realistic  case  the  validity  of  the  above  results  can  be  evaluated  by  analyzing  the 
resonance  frequency  variation  induced  by  the  axial  holes.  A  possible  approach  to  this 
problem is based on a perturbative analysis, which gives the frequency variation due to a 
small  deformation  of  the  metallic  boundary  of  the  resonator.  In  particular,  the  first  order 

variation of the resonance frequency can be written as

[18], where ∆V is the inward variation of the conducting boundary of the resonator, V is its 
full  volume,  and  H0  and  E0  the  unperturbed  magnetic  and  electric  field.  The  brackets 
represent a time average. A reduction of the volume of the resonator leads to an increase of 
the resonance frequency when the magnetic energy in the removed volume is predominant. 
In our case this result can be applied to any intermediate configuration between the initial 
one,  represented  by  Fig.  1b,  and  the  final  one,  given  by  Fig.  1c.  The  final  result  will  be 
obviously  independent  from  the  intermediate  states,  which  can  be  chosen  in  the  most 
convenient way. We will assume intermediate configurations having cylindrical symmetry, 
in which the dielectric tube finishes with flat end surfaces; the profile of the mirrors will 
follow  the  shape  of  the  tube.  The  corresponding  resonance  mode,  initially  given  by  the 
TE011  mode,  remains  of  TE0  nature,  thank  to  the  symmetry  of  the  structure.  As  a 
consequence it is characterized by a maximum of magnetic field and a minimum of electric 
field on the metallic surfaces. For any small elongation of the dielectric tube the resonance 
frequency  decreases,  independently  of  the  starting  configuration.  This  allows  concluding 
that the above transformation gives a net reduction of the resonance frequency of the TE011 
mode.  This  decrease  reinforces  the  axial  NR  condition,  since  reinforces  the  condition 
.  As  a  consequence,  the  allowed  region  shown  in  Fig.  2  is  stable  with

respect to the transformation of a basic NR structure to the axially open one of Fig. 1c. It 
follows  that  Fig.  2  can  be  legitimately  assumed  as  an  approximate  chart  of  allowed

geometrical and dielectric parameters for the TE011 mode. This chart suggests a wide range 
of  proper  working  resonance  conditions  for  axially  open  resonators.  Wider  allowed 
conditions are expected from a more detailed analysis.  

The  same  inductive  demonstration  could  be  in  principle  developed  for  the  other 
resonance modes. However, the situation is here complicated by the simultaneous presence 
of electric and magnetic fields on the metallic boundary of the resonator. Being the other 
modes  by  far  less  important  than  the  TE011  one,  we  will  limit  now  to  generic 
considerations, postponing further comments after the experimental results. In the case of 
the  TM011  mode,  the  lowest  cutoff  frequency  for  the  TM0  counterpart  propagating  along 

the circular waveguide is given by

 is now stronger than that 
root of the Bessel function 
found for the TE011 mode. Moreover, simulations and measurements reported in Refs. [13, 
14]  show  higher  resonance  frequencies  for  the  TM011  mode  than  for  the  TE011  one. 
Accordingly, a substantially reduced region of proper resonant conditions is here expected.  
In  the  case  of  the  HE111  mode,  the  lowest  cutoff  frequency  must  be  chosen  among  that 
ones of both the TE1m and TM1m waveguide modes, due to its hybrid nature. The condition

The above considerations can be generalized to the case of dielectric tubes having finite 
length. The thickness of the mirrors will be still assumed much greater than the extension 
of the evanescent field. Different cases can be considered. If the axial extension of the tube 
is much beyond the extension of the evanescent field, its length is obviously irrelevant for 
the resonance mode. If the tube finishes in the region of the evanescent field, a weak effect 
is expected on the resonance frequencies. On the other hand, the axial confinement of the 
radiation  should  be  reinforced,  due  to  the  increased  cutoff  frequencies  of  the  empty 
metallic waveguide. Finally, when the length of the tube is reduced until it finishes inside 
the mirrors, an abrupt increase of the resonance frequency is expected due to the reduced 
optical thickness of the resonator. 

Having predicted the existence of proper resonant modes in axially open NR structures, 
the  next  step  concerns  a  possible  excitation  scheme.  In  this  respect,  the  basic  similarity 
between the conventional NR resonators and the axially open one here proposed suggests a 
direct  use  of  the  reflection  configuration  employed  in  [13].  A  further  issue  concerns  the 
tuning of the resonance frequency. Two simple approaches can be here envisaged. The first 
one consists in a reduction of the height of the dielectric tube in the active region of the 
resonator,  as  discussed  above.  The  second  one  is  based  on  the  variation  of  the  distance 
between the mirrors. 

The next sections will be devoted to the confirmation of the above considerations. In the 
interpretation of the obtained results the help of the basic NR configuration of Fig. 1b will 
be freely invoked.

The  material  chosen  for  the  dielectric  tube  was  high-purity,  ultra-low  OH-  contents 
Suprasil®  fused  quartz,  commercially  available  from  Polymicro  Technologies,  LLC 
(Arizona, USA). This choice is first motivated by the relatively high permittivity of fused

expected indeed lower than 10-3 at millimeter wavelengths [21]. 
The  resonance  frequency  of  the  TE011  mode  will  be  fixed  again  at  91  GHz.  The 
approximate  size  of  the  dielectric  region  can  be  defined  with  the  help  of  Fig.  2.  In 
particular,  inside  the  allowed  area  the  highest  conversion  factor  is  expected  for  a

The planar mirrors were realized by means of two rectangular aluminium plates, each 6 
mm thick. A series of 1.7 mm holes were drilled in both plates at corresponding positions. 
Subsequent holes were positioned at increasing distances from the boundary of the plates 
in  order  to  allow  different  coupling  ranges.  The  chosen  diameter  allows  a  comfortable 
insertion of the dielectric tube. The relatively wide tolerance with respect to the diameter 
of the tube appears appropriate in view of low temperature applications, since it takes into 
account  the  different  thermal  expansion  of  fused  quartz  and  aluminium.  Moreover,  the 
capability  of  the  resonator  to  allow  a  significant  degree  of  mechanical  tolerance  is  a 
fundamental  prerequisite  for  higher  frequency  applications.  The  thickness  of  the 
aluminium plates was prudentially assumed quite high, since the evanescent decay of the 
radiation along the holes can extend in principle over long distances. 

In the first measurements the distance  l  between the mirrors was fixed to 1.65 ± 0.1 mm. 
A suitable distance between the dielectric tube and the boundary of the mirror was given 
by 1.6 ± 0.1 mm. The final structure of the employed device is reported in Fig. 3.

effects of the axial holes.  

The  structure  of  Fig.  3  was  investigated  in  a  frequency  interval  ranging  from  50  to  92 
GHz. The coupling of the resonator to the incoming radiation was optimized on the TE011 
mode.  A  normalization  procedure  allowed  the  extraction  of  the  true  spectrum  from  the 
signal  background.  The  reflected  signal  was  first  acquired  in  the  proper  coupling 
conditions; the resonator was then completely decoupled from the incoming radiation. The 
reference  signal  obtained  in  this  latter  condition  is  finally  employed  to  extract  the  true 
spectrum  of  the  resonator.  Two  different  techniques  were  employed  to  decouple

orthogonally  to  the  incoming  radiation,  as  suggested  in  Sect.  2.  The  normalized  curve 
obtained  in  this  way  is  shown  in  the  upper  part  of  Fig.  4.  The  second  option  for  the 
acquisition of the signal background is simply to remove the dielectric tube. The result of 
this latter procedure is shown in the lower part of Fig. 4.

The spectra obtained with the above procedures show some discrepancy. A comparison 
between them allows however a clear identification of the actual resonances with respect to 
the  artefacts  introduced  by  the  normalization  procedure  [22].  All  further  normalizations 
will be done removing the resonator. Two resonance modes can be identified in the curves 
of Fig. 4. The first one, which is supposed to be the HE111 mode, is centered at 56.58 GHz

and coupled for 6.1 dB. The corresponding unloaded merit factor is given by 
The axial holes induce here a strong reduction of the resonance frequency with respect to 
the  corresponding  configuration  without  holes.  As  a  consequence  a  substantial 
rearrangement of the field distribution is expected. The second resonance, assigned to the 
TE011 mode, is centered at 86.22 GHz and coupled for 36 dB. The unloaded merit factor is 
=1060.  The  moderate  resonance  frequency  reduction  indicates  here  a 
given  by 
limited distortion of the electromagnetic field.

In  order  to  verify  the  tuning  procedures  proposed  in  the  previous  section,  the  axial

FIG. 5. Normalized spectrum obtained displacing the dielectric tube, as shown in the inset. 

The  resulting  spectrum  is  given  by  the  curve  of  Fig.  5.  The  lower  frequency  resonance 
disappears, or at least appears as a quite broad line. The TE011 mode is on the other hand 
still visible, and centered at 86.92 GHz; the tuning of its resonance frequency was about 
+0.7  GHz.  The  coupling  of  the  resonance  is  given  by  22  dB  and  the  related  merit  factor 
=806. The reduction of this factor can be ascribed to the misalignment of the tube 
0,TEQ
with respect to the axis of the structure. The loss of the axial symmetry generates indeed a 
mixing among different resonance modes, which open in turn channels for electromagnetic 
leakage. A similar reason could explain the disappearance of the HE111 mode.

In  order  to  test  the  second  tuning  mechanism,  the  distance  between  the  mirrors  was 
reduced  to  1.25 ± 0.1  mm.  The  resonance  frequencies  of  the  corresponding  NR

resonator.  A  lower  distance  l   leads  indeed  to  higher  cutoff  frequencies  for  the  parallel-
plates  TE  and  TM  modes,  which  increase  the  decay  of  the  evanescent  field  outside  the 
dielectric region. A proper distance between the tube and the boundary of the mirror was 
given by 1.1 ± 0.1 mm. The spectrum of the resonator obtained in this condition is reported 
in Fig. 6.

The previous results give indirect information on the field distribution of both modes. In 
the case of the HE111 resonance, the tuning due to the above variation of l is much lower 
than that induced by the transformation of the structure from a basic NR to an axially open 
one. This suggests that the rearrangement of the electromagnetic field due to the holes is 
much higher. The field should then extend much more along the axial holes than outside 
the  dielectric  region.  In  the  case  of  the  TE011  mode  the  displacements  of  the  resonance 
frequency are comparable; the field should then extend comparably in the axial holes and 
outside the dielectric region.  

For  ease  of  comparison,  the  three  TE011  modes  observed  in  the  investigated 

configurations are reported in Fig. 7, together with their fit.

In none of the previous measurements there was evidence of the TM011 mode, at least in 

the frequency range of analysis.  

4. Numerical modelling 

 
Additional  information  on  the  observed  resonances  can  be  obtained  with  the  aid  of 
computational methods, which can give field distribution, resonance frequency and quality 
factor for realistic configurations. We will focus in particular on the resonances of Fig. 6, 
namely  for  the  case  of  distance  between  mirrors  equal  to  1.25 ± 0.1  mm.  The  employed 
software  is  the  finite  element  method  FEMLAB  3.0a  (COMSOL,  Sweden).  A  basic 
parameter of this numerical approach is represented by the number of elementary regions 
(mesh elements) in the volume of analysis. Better accuracies are in general obtained for an 
increasing number of mesh elements. Being this number limited by practical reasons, it is 
important  to  reduce  as  much  as  possible  the  volume  of  analysis.  This  can  be  done  by 
exploiting the symmetry of the problem and the properties of the modes of interest. In our 
case, these modes are given by the HE111, the TE011 and the TM011. The planar symmetry 
of the problem can be employed to reduce the modelling to the upper half of the resonator. 
For the above modes the plane of symmetry can be replaced by a magnetic wall [18]. The 
rotational invariance can be exploited to limit the analysis to a sector of the full structure. 
In  particular,  a  quarter  of  the  resonator  can  be  used  for  all  the  above  modes,  provided  a 
proper  combination  of  electric  and  magnetic  walls  is  used  for  the  radial  planes  [23,  24]. 
The  resulting  geometry  of  analysis  is  reported  in  Fig.  8.  Here  the  region  of  modelling 
represents an octant of the actual structure. The shaded area indicates the dielectric region.

the dielectric region.  

 
 
Some  approximations  were  introduced  for  sake  of  simplicity.  The  diameter  of  the 
dielectric tube was assumed equal to that of the holes, namely 1.7 mm. All corners were 
considered perfectly sharp. The height of the metallic mirrors was finally fixed to 5 mm, 
instead to 6 mm as in the experimental case. A perfect electric wall was put initially at the 
end of the axial holes. These assumptions are consistent with the qualitative nature of this 
computational analysis.  

The imposition of boundary conditions suitable for the HE111 mode gave a first resonance 
at  54.54  GHz,  whose  field  distribution  is  reported  in  Fig.  9.  This  solution  is  then 
compatible  with  the  low  frequency  resonance  experimentally  observed,  and  already 
indicated as HE111 mode. The electromagnetic field penetrates in a substantial way inside 
the  axial  holes,  in  agreement  with  the  analysis  of  the  previous  section.  The  discrepancy 
with  the  measured  frequency  is  most  probably  due  to  the  simplification  operated  in  the 
modelling.  On  the  contrary,  the  obtained  field  distribution  is  not  influenced  by  the 
assumption of holes having finite height. The increase of this height from 5 to 6 mm leaves 
the calculated resonance frequency stable within 10-3.

The  use  of  boundary  conditions  compatible  with  the  TE011  mode  gives  a  resonance  at 
91.78 GHz, whose field distribution is reported in Fig. 10. The substantial agreement with 
the experimental result confirms the assignment of this resonance.

In this case the field distribution is essentially limited to the dielectric volume between the 
conducting mirrors, as suggested in the previous section. The active region of the resonator 
is then quite small, and similar to that of the corresponding NR configuration without axial 
holes.  The  length  of  the  dielectric  region  and  the  thickness  of  the  mirrors  are  now  much 
less critical parameters.  

A  similar  analysis  was  developed  for  the  TM011  resonance  by  imposing  the  proper 
boundary  conditions.  The  modelling  showed  in  this  case  that,  when  the  profile  of  the 
resonator  is  modified  from  the  basic  configuration  to  the  axially  open  one,  the  mode 
follows the boundary inside the holes. As a consequence, for the geometry under analysis 
the TM011 resonance cannot be confined in a bounded region.  

The above results can be generalized by using a Perfect Matched Layer (PML), which is 
a non-physical medium able to absorb almost perfectly the incident radiation [25]. A PML 
can be used to simulate the behaviour of an open structure in finite modelling volumes. In 
our case possible leakages of radiation can be monitored including proper PML regions far 
from the expected active volume of the resonator. The results of this analysis confirm that 
the HE111 and the TE011  modes  do  not  irradiate appreciably, while the TM011 is distorted 
and absorbed by the PMLs. 

5. Discussion and conclusions 

 
The  obtained  results  confirm  the  basic  predictions  formulated  in  Sect.  2.  The  first  two 
resonance  modes  of  an  axially  open  resonator  were  observed,  namely  the  hybrid  HE111 
mode  and  the  transverse-electric  TE011  mode.  For  the  former  resonance  the  experimental 
and computational results indicate a relevant extension of the fields along the axial holes. 
This behaviour is expected peculiar of the HE111 mode, due to the low cutoff frequency of 
the  corresponding  waveguide  TE11  mode.  The  HE111  mode  is  then  very  sensitive  to  the 
diameter of the holes and to the thickness of the mirrors. The extension of the mode inside 
the  holes  can  be  limited  reducing  the  length  of  the  dielectric  tube,  as  confirmed  by  the 
numerical modelling.  

The  TE011  mode  can  be  well  confined  in  the  dielectric  region  between  the  metallic 
mirrors.  This  reduced  extension  gives  an  additional  justification  to  the  chart  of  Fig.  2, 
obtained  under  the  assumption  that  the  axial  holes  introduce  a  weak  perturbation.  The 
minimum overall size of the resonator can be reduced in this case up to few wavelengths 
without  appreciable  effects  on  the  confinement  of  the  field.  The  TE011  mode  is  then  an 
ideal candidate for the realization of single-mode resonators having high conversion factor. 
The  performances  of  the  TE011  resonance  here  observed  can  be  evaluated  by  resorting 
again to the NR configuration without holes. The height of the disc can be adjusted until 
the measured resonance frequency is achieved. The value of l corresponding to 91.11 GHz 
is given by 
 mm. The merit factor of this resonance can be first obtained taking 
into account the aluminium conductivity only. The value obtained in this way is given by 
  can  be  then  reproduced  introducing  in  the 
metQ
modelling a proper dielectric absorption. The loss factor of the Suprasil® tube follows as 
by-product of this procedure. It results 
 around 90 GHz, in agreement with 
=
the value given at millimeter wavelengths [21]. Having reproduced the experimental merit 
factor, the conversion factor can be calculated from the field distribution. The so obtained 
  G/W1/2,  represents  a  reasonable  estimation  of  the  conversion 
value,  given  by 
factor  of  the  employed  resonator.  The  above  procedure  is  basically  equivalent  to  assume 
that  the  active  volume  of  the  actual  configuration  is  the  same  of  that  of  the  model

configuration.  This  approximation  is  supported  by  the  TE011  field  distribution  shown  in 
Fig. 10. The obtained merit factor and conversion factor can be compared with those of an 
ideal  TE011  cavity  realized  with  aluminium.  In  this  case  it  results 
  and 
G/W1/2.  Similar  values  have  been  experimentally  demonstrated  in  Ref.  [5].

Although  the  quality  factor  here  obtained  is  substantially  lower  than  that  of  the  ideal 
metallic cavity, the conversion factor is expected of the same order or better [26]. This is 
due to the reduced active volume of a dielectric resonator, which in turn leads to enhanced 
energy  densities.  The  typical  volume  of  a  single-mode  dielectric  resonator,  given  by

Despite the extreme ease of realization and the relatively wide mechanical tolerances, the 
above  demonstrated  resonator  shows  state-of-the-art  performances  at  millimeter 
wavelengths.  These  performances  are  mainly  limited  by  the  absorption  of  fused  quartz. 
Better  results  are  expected  at  lower  temperature,  where  this  absorption  decreases 
considerably. The use of better conductors as copper or silver should give an appreciable 
quality factor improvement as well. The employment of commercial dielectric tubes is one 
of  the  specific  benefits  of  the  proposed  configuration.  Being  these  tubes  available  on 
customer  specifications  down  to  an  external  diameter  of  150 ± 6  µm  (minimum  internal 
diameter 2 ± 1 µm), the realization of higher frequencies single-mode resonators with well-
defined  properties  can  be  easily  accomplished.  The  identification  between  resonator  and 
sample-holder  opens  new  possibilities.  Among  them,  the  simple  and  inexpensive 
replacement of the resonator and the rotation of the sample without need of ad hoc designs. 
The  possibility  to  characterize  different  samples  inserted  along  the  sample  holder  can  be 
accounted for as well. In the specific case of EPR spectroscopy also the use of Suprasil® 
seems strategic, since this material is proven free from appreciable paramagnetic impurities 
also in high-sensitivity instrumentations [7]. The proposed resonator shows finally all the 
benefits  of  a  typical  NR  configuration,  as  the  widely  open  structure  and  the  presence  of 
few non-degenerate resonance modes. 

In  conclusion,  a  single-mode  resonator  based  on  a  low-loss  dielectric  tube  has  been 
predicted  and  demonstrated  following  the  concept  of  axially  open  NR  configuration. 
Simple excitation and tuning mechanisms have been demonstrated as well. State-of-the-art 
performances  have  been  obtained  at  millimeter  wavelengths.  The  proposed  open 
configuration  can  be  easily  generalized  following  the  basic  conditions  governing  the 

behaviour of these rotationally invariant devices, namely

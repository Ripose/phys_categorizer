Abstract 

    Ternary  oxide 

forsterite  Mg2SiO4  single-crystalline  nanobelts  have  been 

synthesized  at  high  yields  via  SiO2  assistant-oxide  through  a  VS  process.  The  PL 

properties  of  the  forsterite  Mg2SiO4 nanobelts were observed. The emission peak at 

625  nm  is  attributed  to  the  4T1  →  6A1  transition  of  the  trace  Mn2+  ions.  The  other 

emission peak at 400nm may be due to the defects.

1 Introduction 

    Nano-scaled  materials  are  widely  recognized  as  the  key  materials  in  nano- 

fabrication. They play decisive roles in nano-technology due to their nanometer-sized 

geometry and unique properties.1-4 The fundamental characteristics of the nanostructure 

materials  arise  from  the  interplay  of  the  electronic  structure  and  the  geormotry.5  In 

order to elucidate the role of the interplay, it is necessary at first to prepare nano-scaled 

materials  of  any  desired  size  and  geometry.6-9  Aside  from  nanotubes,4  various  of 

nanowires  (nanorods)  have  been  fabricated  by  using  different  methods  such  as  laser 

ablation,9 templating,10 arc discharge,11 vapor-phase transport,12 and solution method.13 

Much attention has been paid to synthesize binary oxide nanobelts such as ZnO, CdO, 

Ga2O3  and  SnO2  by  simple  vapor-phase  deposition  from  oxide  sources.14    However, 

the synthesis of ternary oxide nanobelts have not been reported previously.   

      Ternary  oxide  forsterite  (fo-magnesium  orthosilicate,  Mg2SiO4),  the  magnesium 

end  member  of  the  olivine  group  of  minerals,  consists  of  SiO4  tetrahedral  linked  by 

magnesium  actions  in  octahedral  coordination.  It  is  of  well-known  scientific  and 

technological  interest  because  its  physical  and  chemical  properties  in  the  primordial 

solar  nebulae  are  believed  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  fractionation  of  elements 

prior to planet formation.15 - 16 In addition, forsterite is a major component of the earth’s 

upper  mantle  and  is  thus  of  considerable  importance  in  controlling  its  seismic 

properties,  rheological  behavior  and  thermal  structure.17  Moreover,  with  discovery  of 

the  near-infrared  lazing  properties  of  chromium-doped  signal  crystals,  there  has 

recently  been  renewed  interest  in  forsterite  in  materials  science.18-19  Conventionally, 

forsterite  can  be  synthesized  by  solid-state  reactions  between  MgO  and  SiO2  at 

elevated  temperatures  (1100-1400  OC).20, 21  However,  this  requires  high  temperatures, 

thus several sol-gel based routes have been used to synthesize forsterite powders, often 

 

2

with trace enstatite.22-24 In this communication, we have successfully synthesized single 

crystalline  forsterite  nanobelts  by  chemical  vapor  deposition  from  Mg  powders  and 

SiO2  nanoparticles.  The  very 

interesting 

thing 

is 

that  we  have  observed 

photoluminescence emission from these Mg2SiO4 nanobelts. 

2 Experiment Section   

  2. 1 Example preparation 

A  mixture  of  Mg  powders  (99.99%,  <0.5  µm)  and  SiO2  nanoparticle  powders 

(about 80 nm) was placed on a ceramic boat. This boat was put into a ceramic tube 

(25 mm inner diameter) that was inserted in a horizontal electronic resistance furnace. 

Then the furnace was rapidly heated up to1100 OC, and kept at this temperature for 60 

min  with  constant  flow  of  argon  gas  at  a  flow  rate  of  200  sccm  (standard  cubic 

centimeters/minute). After the system had cooled down to room temperature, a large 

piece  of  white,  wool-like  product  was  collected  from  the  inner  wall  of  the  ceramic 

boat at the downstream end. 

2.2 Characterization and PL, EPR Measurements 

      The  products  were  characterized  by  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  (PW  1710 

instrument with Cu Ka radiation, operated at 40 keV and 40 mA), scanning electron 

microscopy  (SEM)  (JEOL  JSM  6300F),  high-resolution  transmission  electron 

microscopy  (HRTEM)  (JEOL  2010,  operated  at  200  kV),  Energy–dispersive  X-ray 

fluorescence  (EDX)  (EDAX,  DX-4)  attached  to  the  JEOL  2010.  For  SEM 

observations, the product was pasted on the Al substrate by carbon conducting paste. 

Specimens for TEM and HRTEM investigation were briefly ultra-sonicated in ethanol, 

and then a drop of suspension was placed  on  a  holey  copper  grid  with  carbon  film. 

The  electron  paramagnetic  resonance  (EPR)  spectrum  was  carried  out  by  using  a 

Bruker  ER-200D  electron  paramagnetic  resonance  device  with  10  dB  (20  mw)  at 

 

3

room  temperature.  Photoluminescence  spectra  were  obtained  using  a  Hitachi 

850-fluorescence spectrophotometer with Xe lamp at room temperature. 

3 Result and Discussion 

      The phase purity of the as-synthesized products was examined by XRD. All of the 

reflection of the XRD pattern in Fig.1 can be indexed to a pure orthorhombic phase 

[space group: Pbnm (62)] of forsterite Mg2SiO4 with lattice constants of a = 4.755 Å, 

b = 10.198 Å and c = 5.979 Å (JCPDS 84-1402). 

      The  morphology,  structure  and  composition  of  the  as-synthesized  products  have 

been  characterized  using  SEM,  HRTEM  and  EDS.  Typical  SEM  images  of  the 

products are shown in Fig.2. A low-magnification SEM (Fig.2a) shows some straight 

and  twisted  wire-like  nanostructures  with  several  to  hundreds  micrometers  long.  A 

representative high-magnification SEM image (Fig. 2b) of two belts reveals that each 

nanobelt has a uniform width about several hundreds nanometers and thickness about 

tens  nanometers  along  its  entire  length,  displaying  the  shape  characteristics  of  the 

belts. The typical width of the nanobelts are in the range of 100-500 nm, the thickness 

and width-to-thickness ratios of the Mg2SiO4 nanobelts are in the range of 10-30 nm 

and ~10-50, respectively, as determined from several tens of nanobelts. 

        Fig. 3a and b show the Mg2SiO4 nanobelts were synthesized at 1100 OC for 30 

and  60  min,  respectively.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  geometrical  shape  of  the 

as-synthesized  nanostructures  is  a  belt  that  is  distinct  in  cross-section  from  the 

previously reported nanotubes4 and nanowires.9- 13 Each nanobelt has a uniform width 

and thickness along its entire length, and no nanoparticles were observed at the tips of 

the nanobelts. A ripple-like contrast observed in TEM images is due to strain from the 

bending of the belt. In addition, it is clearly that the nanobelt (about 150 nm in width) 

shown in Fig. 3a is smaller than that (about 500 nm in width) shown in Fig.3b. This 

 

4

result demonstrates that if the reaction time is shorter, the dimensions of the forsterite 

nanobelts will be smaller. The SAED pattern and HRTEM image (Fig.3c) reveal that 

the  forsterite  nanobelts  are  structurally  uniform  and  single  crystalline.  The  SAED 

pattern  (Fig.3c,  inset)  recorded  perpendicular  to  the  nanobelt  long  axis  could  be 

indexed for the [010] zone axis of single crystalline forsterite Mg2SiO4 and suggests 

that  the  nanobelt  growth  along  the  <101>  direction.  Fig.3c  also  shows  a 

lattice–resolution HRTEM of the nanobelt with 0.476 nm and 0.598 nm lattice fringes 

in agreement with the d values of the (100) and (001) planes of the forsterite crystal. 

The  surfaces  of  the  nanobelts  are  clean,  atomically  sharp  and  without  any  sheathed 

amorphous  phase.  In  addition,  the  HRTEM  image  and  SAED  pattern  show  that  the 

flat  plane  of  the  nanobelts  is  {010}  surface.  This  non-dipolar  termination  of  {010} 

surface,  which  is  a  closed-packed  plane  with  a  small  surface  area  (28.6 Ǻ2  per  unit 

cell), with small relaxed surface energy of 1.28 J m2, is the major cleavage plane of 

forsterite  and  the  most  stable surface under dry conditions,20 which is introduced to 

minimize  the  surface  area  possibly  for  reducing  the  total  surface  energy.  Therefore, 

these  forsterite  nanobelts  with  flat  plane  {010}  are  more  stable  than  with  other  flat 

planes.  EDX  analysis  (Fig.3d)  of  this  nanobelt  reveals  that  the  compositions  of  the 

nanobelt  are  Mg  28.4  at%,  and  Si  14.2  at%  and  O  57.4  at%  similar  to  that  of  bulk 

Mg2SiO4 (Mg: Si:O=2:1:4). 

      Fig.  4  shows  the  PL  spectrum  of  the  forsterite  nanobelts.  The  peak  shape  is 

distinctive in having two pronounced sub- peaks. The spectrum is disconvoluted into 

ultraviolet peak 1 at 3.1 eV (about 400 nm) and red peak 2 at 2.0 eV (about 627 nm) 

by  best  fitting  with  Gassian  functions.  As  we  know  that  bulk  forsterite  cannot  emit 

light at room temperature. However, the present measurement (Fig. 4) shows a strong 

and broad PL emission spectrum from the forsterite nanobelts.   

 

5

      What  are  the  origins  of  these  PL  peaks?  Fig.  5  shows  the  EPR  spectrum  of  the 

as-synthesized  products  measured  at  room  temperature.  The  well  resolved  6-fold 

structure  (marked  A)  is  consistent  with  Mn2+  (nuclear  spin  I=5/2  with  100% 

abundance),  and  it  matches  well  with  that  reported  in  references25-27.  This  result 

confirms  that  trace  Mn2+  ions  exist  in  our  products,  which  possibly  come  from  the 

impurity  Mn  in  the  Mg  powders  or  from  the  ceramic  tube  or  boat.  However,  these 

Mn2+ ions didn’t detected by the EDS. The reason may be that the content of Mn2+ 

ions is too little to be detected due to the limitation sensitivities of EDS. From Fig. 4, 

the  EPR  parameters  for  the  Mn2+  center  are  obtained  as  g  =  2.001  and  hyperfine 

constant A = 86.6 Gauss similar to that for the Mn2+ in Mn-doped MgO.28 However, 

the structure (marked B) in Fig. 4, which can not be indexed to Mn2+ ions, indicates 

that some other defects may exist in the forsterite nanobelts. It has been reported that 

there existed two broad bands centered at 740 and 460 nm, which attributed to the 4A2 

→4T2  and  4A2  →  4T1  absorptive  transitions  in  Cr3+-doped  forsterite.18  This  result 

indicates  that  impurity-doped  forsterite  may  yield  new  bands.  Therefore,  the  trace 

Mn2+ ions may generate new energy levels in our product. Recently, many work have 

been  reported  on  the  PL  properties  of  Mn2+-  doped  nanoparticles,  resulting  that  the 

emission band at about 600 nm is mainly due to the 6A1 ← 4T1 transition of Mn2+.25-27 

In  our  case,  the  peak  at  625  nm  may  be  attributed  to  this  transition.  As  for  the  red 

shift, it may be due to the dimension confinement (the band energy is often blue shift 

from  larger  size  to  smaller  size  nanomaterials).  The  average  dimensions  of  the 

forsterite nanobelts (30 nm in thick, 300 nm in width and 100 µm in length) are lager 

than the diameters of the Mn:ZnS or Mn:CdS nanoparticles (several nm). 25-27   

      The  emission  at  400  nm  may  be  related  to  the  defect  centers,  which  were 

confirmed  by 

the  EPR 

structure  B. 

In  our  case,  during 

the 

rapid 

 

6

evaporation–oxidation  process  of  forsterite  nanobelts,  oxygen  vacancies  or  other 

defects, such as Mg-Si partial disorder, local charge unbalance29, 30 would be formed 

because  of  partially  incomplete  oxidation  or  other  effects.  In  addition,  the  forsterite 

nanobelts  with  high  aspect  ratio  and  peculiar  morphologies  should  also  favor  the 

existence  of  oxygen  vacancies  or  other  defects  on  the  surface.  These  defects  will 

represent new energy levels in the band gap and possibly respond for the emission. 31, 

32 From Fig. 4, it can be seen that the emission intensities of the peak at 625 nm is 

larger than that of the peak at 400 nm. This result indicates the number of Mn2+ ions 

is larger than that of defects.   

      As for the growth mechanism of the forsterite nanobelts, we find that there are no 

spherical  droplets,  which  are  known  to  be  good  evidence  for  vapor-liquid-solid 

(VLS)9 growth mechanism, at the tips of these Mg2SiO4 nanobelts. This observation 

quantitatively suggests that the nanobelts do not grow by VLS mechanism proposed 

for nanowires grown by a catalytic technique.9 It is likely that the Mg2SiO4 nanobelts 

follow a growth mechanism similar to the vapor-solid (VS) mechanism for the binary 

oxide  nanobelts.14  To  understand  the  growth  of  these  Mg2SiO4  nanobelts,  the 

following reactions should be taken into account.   

        Mg(g)+SiO2(s)----MgO(s)+SiO (g)                            (1) 

        2Mg(g)+4SiO(g)----- Mg2SiO4 (s)+3Si (s,l)              (2) 

        Si(s,l)+SiO2(s)----2SiO(g)                                          (3) 

        2MgO(s)+SiO2(s)---- Mg2SiO4(s)                              (4) 

The melting and boiling points of Mg are 651 and 1107  OC, that of Si are 1410 and 

2355  OC,  that  of  MgO  are  2800  and  3600  OC,  and  SiO2  are  1610  and  2950  OC 

respectively.  The  melting  point  of  Mg2SiO4  is  1890  OC.  SiO  is  vapor  phase  at  the 

temperature above 930 OC.33 In addition SiO vapor can be formed due to the existence 

 

7

of an eutectic in the Si-SiO2 system.34 Therefore, at 1100 OC temperature used in our 

experiment, gas species SiO(g) and Mg(g) can be continuously originated. SiO(g) is 

produced  by  reactions:  (Eq.1)  between  gaseous  Mg  and  SiO2  nanoparticles  or  can 

appear  as  a  product  of  reaction  (Eq.3)  between  the  yield  Si  and  SiO2  nanoparticles. 

Then Mg2SiO4 can be produced by reaction (Eq.2) between Mg(g) and SiO(g). There 

have been reported that Mg2SiO4 can be formed by solid reaction    (Eq. 4) between 

MgO and SiO2 at 850  or 1100  OC.20, 21 Therefore the solid reaction (Eq.4) will also 

take place. But the reaction (Eq.2) will be preferred due to the gaseous nature of this 

process. During the reaction progress, a little yellow smoke was continuously flowing 

out from the downstream end of the ceramic tube. This smoke was detected as SiO 

gas. The leftover of the reaction mixture was SiO2 and some Mg2SiO4 without MgO, 

because SiO2 was excess in the source materials. We have found that if the reaction 

time  is  longer,  more  Mg(g),  SiO(g)  and  MgO(s)  are  generated  resulting  in  forming 

thicker Mg2SiO4 nanobelts. So thinner Mg2SiO4 nanobelts can be obtained through a 

shorter reaction time.   

4 Conclusion 

        In  summary,  ternary  oxide  forsterite  Mg2SiO4  nanobelts  with  uniform  width, 

thickness,  and  length  have  been  synthesized  at  high  yields  via  SiO2  assistant-oxide 

through  a  VS  process.  The  PL  properties  of  the  forsterite  Mg2SiO4  nanobelts  were 

observed. The emission peak at 625 nm is attributed to the 4T1 → 6A1transition of the 

trace Mn2+ ions. The other emission peak at 400nm may be due to the defects in the 

nanobelt. With a well-defined geometry and perfect crystal structure, the nanobelts are 

likely to be a model materials family for a systematic understanding in the electronical, 

thermal,  optical  and  ionic  transport  processes  as  well  as  mechanical  behavior  1D 

nanostructures with the absence of dislocations. This will be an exciting new field for 

 

8

nanomaterials.   

      The synthesis route of forsterite Mg2SiO4 nanobelts, SiO2 assistant-oxide process 

will offer great opportunity for the scale up preparation of other metal oxide MxOy or 

ternary oxide MySiOx1D nanostructure materials (M is the element who will be oxided 

by  SiO2),  such  as  Al2O3  nanowires  and  nanobelts,  SnO2  nanobelts,  SiOx 

nanostructures.

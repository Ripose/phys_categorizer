Abstract— This paper reports on a current R&D activity for
the sensor part of the CMS pixel detector. Devices featuring
several design and technology options have been irradiated up
to a proton ﬂuence1 of
at the CERN PS.
Afterwards they have been bump bonded to unirradiated readout
chips. The chip allows a non zero suppressed full analogue
readout and therefore a good characterization of the sensors
in terms of noise and charge collection properties. The samples
have been tested using high energy pions in the H2 beam line of
the CERN SPS in June and September 2003. The results of this
test beam are presented and the differences between the sensor
options are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The CMS experiment, currently under construction at the
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (Geneva, Switzer-
land), will contain a hybrid pixel detector for tracking and
vertexing. It will consist in its ﬁnal conﬁguration of three
barrel layers and two end disks at each side. The barrels will be
53 cm long and placed at radii of 4.3 cm and 7.2 cm while the
third layer at 11.0 cm will be added later to provide a 3 layer
system at high luminosity. The end disks are located at a mean
distance to the interaction point of 32.5 cm and 46.5 cm. The
whole system will provide three high resolution space points
up to a pseudorapidity2 of (cid:29)
(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:29)! #"%$&" . A total area of about
in the barrels will be covered by about 800 modules

In order to achieve the best vertex position measurement
the spatial resolution of the sensor should be as good in the

magnetic ﬁeld is used to distribute the signal over several
channels. Hence the detectors are not tilted in the barrel layers.
The resolution along the

in the region with low pseudorapidity and by charge sharing
if the tracks hit the sensors under an angle where the typical
cluster size can exceed values of 6 or 7. The best resolution
will be reached at the point where the charge is distributed
over about two pixels. In the disks where the charge carrier

This paper reports on the development of the sensor part of
the system. A general overview on the CMS pixel project is
given in ref. [1]. Because of the harsh radiation environment
at the LHC the technical realization of the pixel detector is
extremely challenging. All components of the pixel detector
are speciﬁed to remain operational up to a particle ﬂuence of
at least Y

)b+ .

This implies that the pixel sensors have to deliver a suf-
ﬁciently high signal until
the end of their life time. The
ﬁnal readout chips feature built-in data sparciﬁcation with a
threshold set to 2000-3000 electrons in order to suppress noise
m m, a minimum ionizing
hits. With a sensor thickness of "(cid:13)(X9
particle creates about 22 000 electron-hole pairs (most proba-
ble value). However, with increasing irradiation this charge
cannot be fully collected due to trapping and incomplete
depletion. As both effects can be reduced by increasing the
sensor bias, the choice of the sensor concept must allow the
application of elevated bias voltages without causing electrical
breakdown. For the CMS pixel detector a maximum value
of 500-600 V is foreseen. In addition to the radiation-induced
effects there might be regions in the sensor with lower charge
collection efﬁciency which have to be minimized by design
optimization.

The irradiation induced effects in silicon are well known
and can be divided into surface and bulk damage. The oxide
charge increases until its saturation value of some 7
reached after some kGy. The concentration of interface traps
also increases. Both effects inﬂuence the electric ﬁelds close to
the surface and have to be considered when designing a sensor
for radiative environments. The leakage current increases in
proportion to the hadron ﬂuence. When the hadron ﬂuence
the space charge in the
exceeds about
depletion zone converts from positive (n-type) to negative
(p-type) before increasing proportionally to the ﬂuence. The
change of the effective doping concentration shows a com-
plex annealing behavior with exponential dependence on the
sensor’s temperature. In order to prevent reverse annealing,
irradiated sensors must be kept cold.

II. SENSOR CONCEPTS UNDER STUDY

After the irradiation-induced space charge inversion of the
substrate and the subsequent increase of the full depletion
voltage, sensors might have to be operated partially depleted.
Therefore an “n-in-n” concept has been chosen. In addition
double-sided processing of these devices allows for the im-
plementation of guard rings on the p-side of the sensor only,
keeping all sensor edges at ground potential. The design of the
guard rings has been optimized in the past [2]. The breakdown
voltage exceeds by far the required value of about 600 V.

In order to readout the ohmic n-side of the sensor inter-
pixel isolation has to be provided. Here p-stops are considered
as well as the p-spray technique. The pixel-layout of the
two design options investigated for this study are shown in
ﬁg. 1. In order to test the segmented devices on wafer with
current-voltage (IV) measurements and to keep accidentally
unconnected pixel cells close to ground potential, high resistive
electrical connections between the pixels have been imple-
mented. In the case of p-stops this was realized by openings
in the p-stop implants. The ﬁxed positive oxide charge builds
up a electron accumulation that forms a ”resistive network” to
which all pixels are connected via the openings (see ﬁg. 2).
The properties of such “resistors” have been studied in detail in
refs. [2] and [3]. According to previous investigations [3], [4]
the most promising geometries feature small distances between

2

the n (cid:0) -implants and quite large p-stop openings. Both are
realized in the design under study shown in ﬁg.1a.

In addition we investigated prototypes featuring the moder-
ated p-spray isolation technique. Here the isolating p-implant
is performed without a photo-lithographic mask and therefore
no structuring is possible. However punch-through biasing can
be implemented. Its behavior is much less dependent on outer
conditions like backside bias and radiation effects than the
resistors formed by electron accumulation. The layout (see
m m between the
ﬁg. 1b) is characterized by small gaps of "
n (cid:0) -implants and by a minimized biasing structure using small
“bias dots” [5].

A batch of prototype pixel sensors containing devices with
the pixel geometry described above was produced in 2001.
Following the recommendation of the ROSE collaboration
[6], oxygen enriched silicon was used to improve the post
irradiation behavior.

In order to match the dimensions of the readout chip used
" square
for sensor studies miniature sensors containing "-"
pixels with a pitch of 7
+ have been used. Although
these dimensions differ slightly from the cell size used in CMS
we are conﬁdent that the basic charge collection properties
presented in this paper are not effected by the change of the
),+ . Other properties, as for example
cell size to 7
the spatial resolution, have to be measured with the original
conﬁguration.

III. TEST PROCEDURE
Several miniature sensors of the two designs were bump
bonded to readout chips of the type PSI30/AC303 described
in detail in ref. [7]. This chip allows one to force a sequential
readout of all 704 pixel cells without zero suppression. All
comparators are switched off by masking the pixels or setting
the thresholds to very high values. The sampling time at the
shaper is deﬁned by an external hold signal. The shaping
times of the preampliﬁer and the shaper were adjusted to
prevent saturation of the preampliﬁer and shaper up to signals
corresponding to about 1.5 minimal ionizing particles (m.i.p.).
In the test beam setup a pin-diode was used to provide the
external hold signal and to trigger the readout.

Some of the sensors were irradiated at the CERN PS in
May 2003 after bump deposition but before being attached
to the readout chips. The irradiation was performed at room
temperature without bias. The ﬂuences applied were 3, 8, and
+ . In order to avoid reverse annealing the
sensors were stored at (cid:3)
C after irradiation and warmed
up to room temperature only for transport and bump bonding.
For the irradiated sensors a special bump bonding procedure
without heat application was used. The total time at room
temperature was below 48 h and therefore all devices were
still in the state of beneﬁcial annealing at the measuring time.
Prior to bump bonding all sensors were characterized with
IV-measurements.

The bump bonded samples were tested at the CERN-SPS
"-"-9 GeV pions. The pixel device

3PSI30 DMILL pixel readout chip was designed 1997 at Paul Scherrer Insti-
tut, Villigen, Switzerland, and translated 1998 to the Honeywell RICMOS IV
process at 1. Physikalisches Institut of the RWTH Aachen, Germany.

A. Inter-pixel resistance

IV. RESULTS

While p-spray isolated devices naturally feature high inter-
pixel isolation the inter-pixel resistance of the p-stop devices
depends very much on the geometry of the openings in the
p-stop rings and on the gap width.

Figure 3 shows the inter-pixel resistance of different pixel
designs as a function of the sensor bias. An array of 9
9 pixels
was grounded while the potential of the center pixel was set
to (cid:2)
7 V. The current ﬂowing into this pixel was measured in
dependence of the back side voltage. In order to illustrate the
effect of the p-stop openings in the p-stop design (ﬁg. 1a),
an identical design with closed p-stops, a different p-stop
geometry, and the p-spray design (ﬁg. 1b) are also shown.

As the depletion starts from the back side (“n-in-n”), part
of the current ﬂows through the bulk before full depletion is
reached and the corresponding inter-pixel resistance is low.
With progressing depletion this channel is pinched off and
the resistance in the fully isolated devices increases rapidly
by several orders of magnitude. In the devices featuring
p-stop openings a residual current ﬂows over the electron
accumulation layer. However, with the backside bias being
increased further this electron channel also starts to be pinched
off. This is visible in ﬁg. 3 for the curve labeled “p-stop (Var)”
at bias above 200 V.

The design called “p-stop” shows no pinch off up to 300 V.
Its inter-pixel resistance at backside voltage of 150 V is only
. This results in wide signal spreading along the
about 7
resistive channels. The test beam data with the unirradiated

inter-pixel resistance reaches a value of (cid:1)

over several pixels.

For irradiated sensors the resistance of the electron accu-
), more or

mulation layer is much higher (in the order of GW
less independent on the designs [2], [3].

B. Characteristics and Noise

The current vs. voltage characteristic is a very sensitive tool
used in detecting possible problems in a sensor. Especially
after irradiation an early current increase is an indication for
electrical breakdown. Early breakdown accompanied by noise
increase was previously observed in irradiated p-stop isolated
devices [3], [10] and is considered to be their major drawback.
To improve the breakdown behavior of the p-stop devices,
the implantation dose of the p-stop implant has systematically
been reduced from the typically used 7
cm ce+ down to the
p-spray level of (cid:1)
+ cm ce+ . The IV-characteristics of theses
devices after a proton irradiation of (cid:18)(cid:20)(cid:19)
are plotted in ﬁg. 4 together with two p-spray devices. It is
seen that the current and the slope of the curve decreases with
decreasing p-stop dose. The sensors with a p-stop dose of
+ cm ce+ show an IV-characteristic similar to the one of

the p-spray sensors.

In total six sensors of the two designs have been bump
bonded to readout chips. Since a full non zero-suppressed
readout is possible, the noise of each pixel can be easily
determined. In ﬁg. 5 the bias dependence of the average pixel
noise is shown for two sensors of each type unirradiated and
irradiated to (
)b+ . 12 ADC-counts correspond to a
noise of about 400 electrons. However this number represents
only an approximate estimation as an exact calibration was
not yet performed.

For the irradiated sensors no distinct bias dependence of the
noise is observed. The noise of the irradiated p-spray sensors is
about 1 ADC count higher than the noise of the p-stop senors.

Fig. 5. Bias dependence of the noise on four bump bonded pixel sensors.
The central value indicates the mean and the error bar the sigma of a Gaussian
ﬁt to the noise distribution of all connected pixels in each sensor.

(not plotted in ﬁg. 5) shows a noise of 17.4 ADC counts at
600 V, which is still tolerable.

The noise of the unirradiated p-stop sensor at 300 V is quite
high (14.4 ADC counts) and decreases with increasing bias
to 11.8 ADC counts at 500 V. This is because the inter-pixel
resistance increases and the coupling between pixels becomes
weaker.

The error bars in ﬁg. 5 represent the sigma of a Gaussian ﬁt
to noise distribution in each sensor and therefore the variation
of the noise with the sensor. We observe no localized regions
of high noise.

From the absence of noisy regions and from the shape of
the IV-curves we conclude that electrical breakdown in p-
stop isolated silicon detectors can be avoided by reducing the
implantation dose to about 7

cm ce+ .

C. Charge Collection Properties

The high energy pion beam of the CERN SPS (150-
225 GeV) together with a high precision beam telescope [8]
m m-level.
allows for detailed study of the pixel sensor on a 7
Of particular interest is the study of the charge collection
efﬁciency as a function of the particle impact point in order
to locate “blind” spots within the pixel cell.

Figure 6 shows the mean total cluster charge deposited by
perpendicular tracks as function of the pion impact position.
The area shown represents one square pixel cell with a pitch
m m. The cluster signal was obtained by summing the
of 7
signals of the (cid:1)
(cid:1) pixels around the impact point (pixel
threshold: 20 ADC counts, cluster threshold: 50 ADC counts).
The average amplitude of the cluster signals are listed in
table I. In addition values are given for the signal amplitude
in the pixel center and regions with reduced charge collection.
The cluster size was determined by counting the number
of pixels above threshold in the direct neighborhood of the
impact point. Its average value as a function of the applied
pixel threshold is plotted in ﬁg. 7. The average cluster size for
a threshold of 60 ADC counts is listed in table I.

To calculate the signal over noise ratio, only the signal in
the “hit pixel”, the pixel pointed to by the beam telescope,
is taken into account. It is obtained by histogramming the

also listed in table I. Values are also given for tracks passing
the the pixel center. The signal to noise ratio was calculated
by dividing the average signal in the hit pixel by its noise. A
more detailed discussion of the signal to noise ratio including
its bias dependence is given in ref. [9].

1) Unirradiated p-spray sensors: For unirradiated p-spray
sensors a very homogeneous average cluster signal of about
800 ADC counts is observed. At the position of the bias dot
it drops to less than half of this value. As this critical area
represents only 2–3 % of the total surface the average collected
signal is only weakly affected.

On average about 89 % of the charge is collected by the
hit pixel. For tracks in the pixel center this number increases
to 96 %. Consequently,
the average cluster size is below
1.3 pixels. The large fraction of the cluster signal being
collected by one pixel leads to a high signal over noise ratio
of 65.

2) Irradiated p-spray sensors: After irradiation with a
ﬂuence of (cid:18)
the value of the total
collected cluster charge is reduced by about 25 %. Furthermore
an additional area of reduced charge collection appears at
the metal line connecting the bias dots. The collected cluster
charge of particles hitting this region is almost 40 % smaller
than those hitting the pixel center. As there is no direct contact
between this metal line and the silicon below, this behavior
(also reported in ref. [11]) was a priori unexpected and not
yet fully understood. It seems plausible that the charge loss
is caused by capacitive coupling. Before irradiation the metal
line is shielded by the conductive p-spray layer. However after
irradiation the p-spray layer behaves like a (bad) insulator and
a charge drifting below this layer can induce an electrical

signal on the bias line above. Since the total affected area
is under 10 %, the signal averaged over the whole pixel cell
is about 7 % smaller than the signal collected in the central
pixel region.

The charge sharing between pixels is not effected by the
irradiation. Still 89 % of the cluster charge is collected by one
pixel and the average cluster size decreases only a little. As
the signal height decreases and the noise slightly increases,
the signal over noise ratio of this irradiated sensor decreases
to 41.

’%Z_[e\(cid:15)]_^-‘3a

For the p-spray sensor irradiated to (cid:18)

)b+ ,
the general behavior remains unchanged. However, due to the
reduced cluster signal and the increased noise, the signal over
noise ratio is further reduced. A more detailed discussion of
the charge collection dependence on the particle ﬂuence and
the bias voltage is presented in ref. [9].

3) Unirradiated p-stop sensors: The highest average cluster
signals were observed in the center of an unirradiated p-stop
sensor, 905 ADC counts, which is about 12 % larger than the
maximum in the p-spray devices. However, one has to take
into account the use of 300 V bias voltage in order to reduce
the charge spread due to the resistive connections between

pixels. Even at such a high bias voltage the average cluster
size, using a pixel threshold of 60 ADC counts, is above 3,
much higher than in the other investigated sensors. Even if a
pixel is hit centrally it carries only 63 % of the total cluster
signal (in average it is only 50 %). Close to the pixel border
the cluster signal decreases by about 15 % compared to the
central region. As the hit pixel carries only a small fraction of
the total cluster signal, the signal to noise ratio is only 29.

4) Irradiated p-stop sensors: Due to the irradiation induced
increase of the inter-pixel resistance the average cluster size
of the irradiated p-stop sensors decreases to values below 1.5.
At the same time the fraction of the cluster signal collected
by the hit pixel increases to 85 %, the same level as in the p-
spray sensors. While the average cluster charge in the sensor
irradiated to (cid:18)
),+ decreases by about 20 %
compared to the unirradiated sensor, the charge collected by
the hit pixel stays about unchanged. When the pixel is hit in
its center, the charged collected by the hit pixel even increases.
The concentration of signal charge on one pixel leads to an
increase of the signal over noise ratio to 41, exactly the same
value as the p-spray sensor irradiated to the same ﬂuence.

’(cid:20)ZD[(cid:18)\(cid:15)]_^-‘3a

The cluster charge for tracks close to the pixel border
decreases to half of the value for tracks in the center. The
reason for this signiﬁcant charge loss is not fully understood
but the following explanation seems possible: The electron
accumulation layer between the p-stops adjusts to the same
potential as the pixel implants due to the openings in the p-
stops. For this reason the layer also collects signal charge.
For the unirradiated sensor the surface mobility in the electron
accumulation layer is high enough to allow a quick transfer of
the collected charge to the next readout n (cid:0) -implant. Therefore
the average cluster size in the unirradiated sensor is very high.
After irradiation the mobility of free charge carriers close to
the surface is strongly reduced and the number of surface traps
increases. The charge drift to the next readout n (cid:0) -implant is
slower and a signiﬁcant fraction of the signal collected in
the accumulation layer might not reach it in time. Hence the
cluster size in the irradiated p-stop sensor is much smaller.

collection behavior discussed in the previous sections into
efﬁciency measures, realistic thresholds have been required. If
the pixel pointed to by the beam telescope or a direct neighbor
was above the threshold, the track was counted as detected.
A cluster threshold was not applied. Regions of defect bump
bonding or noisy pixels were excluded from this analysis.

The choice of the threshold values is somewhat arbitrary
as the amplitude of the signal output was not yet properly
calibrated. As the noise of all sensors is between 11 and
13 ADC counts, a threshold of 60 ADC counts, about ﬁve times
the noise, was chosen to estimate the efﬁciency numbers. This
value corresponds roughly to a signal charge between 2000 and
2200 electrons. The probability for detecting a particle with a
pixel threshold of 60 ADC channels is given in table I. In all
cases it is above 98 %.

Z_[

\(cid:15)]_^-‘(cid:13)a

1) p-spray sensors: The inefﬁciency as a function of the
threshold is plotted in ﬁg. 8 for both designs under study,
and for proton ﬂuences of 0 and (
+ . Here a
difference between the designs is visible. In the unirradiated p-
spray design the charge loss due to the bias dot is small enough
not to cause an inefﬁciency if the pixel threshold is below
100 ADC counts. For higher thresholds the lost tracks start
to concentrate around this area. In the case of the irradiated
p-spray sensor the probability for loosing a track hitting the
bias dot is higher due to the lower total charge. Already at low
threshold the total inefﬁciency is about 1 %. With increasing
threshold the inefﬁciency rises as well. Tracks hitting the
region below the metal line of the bias grid start to contribute,
starting from the corner of the pixel and growing along the
pixel edge below the metalization. When the threshold exceeds
130 ADC channels, a small accumulation of lost tracks can be
found also in the corners opposite to the metal line. As the
total problematic area is quite small, the slope of the increase
is limited and the inefﬁciency does not exceed 4 % even at
high threshold (e.g. 160 ADC counts).

2) p-stop sensors: For the p-stop designs the situation
looks different. As the charge loss in the pixel edge region
is less drastic, the efﬁciency at low threshold is also above
99.5 % also for the irradiated sensor. However, as the less
efﬁcient region at the pixel edge covers a signiﬁcant fraction
of the area, the inefﬁciency increases rapidly with increasing
threshold. The lost tracks accumulate at the pixel corners. With
increasing threshold the regions of lower efﬁciency grow along
the pixel edges.

Although the irradiated p-stop sensor reach a better efﬁ-
ciency at a threshold of 60 ADC counts, it has to be stressed
that the high slope of the inefﬁciency displays a potential
risk. A small threshold variation can lead to a non-tolerable
inefﬁciency above 5 %. The p-stop sensor irradiated to (

+ has also been measured at a bias voltage of
600 V. The higher bias increases the collected charge and the
detection efﬁciency, although not signiﬁcantly.

The situation in the test beam with perpendicular tracks
without magnetic ﬁeld is well suited for characerizing the
charge collection properties of the sensors with high precision.
In the ﬁnal experiment, however, the signal charge will always
be spread over a certain area due to the track inclination and
the Lorentz drift. Therefore the effect of small regions with
reduced charge collection will be suppressed.

V. CONCLUSIONS

]_^(cid:13)‘(cid:13)a

Silicon pixel sensors of “n-in-n” type featuring p-spray and
p-stop isolation have been irradiated to proton ﬂuences up
to 7-$
+ . All sensors show IV-curves with a
breakdown voltage well above 600 V without localized noisy
regions. In the case of p-stop sensors this was achieved by
reducing the p-stop implantation dose to about 7

cm ce+ .

The charge collection studies were performed with bump
bonded samples in a high energy pion beam. The total charge
collected after the highest ﬂuence applied was about 60 % of
the value obtained with unirradiated sensors independent of
the sensor design. The main results for the different sensor
type are the following.
p-spray sensors

(cid:0) The p-spray devices showed a very homogeneous charge

collection also in the inter-pixel regions.

(cid:0) The bias dots represent an area with strongly reduced
charge collection, leading to a loss of particle detection
efﬁciency of about 1 % after an irradiation ﬂuence of (

(cid:0) For irradiated sensors the metal line of the bias grid

additionally reduces the charge collection.

(cid:0) The particle detection efﬁciency after this ﬂuence still
exceeds 98 % and is only moderately dependent on the
pixel threshold.

p-stop sensors

In the unirradiated sensor the signal is spread over many
pixels.

(cid:0) After irradiation this spread is strongly reduced.

of a central hit.

(cid:0) The particle detection efﬁciency is above 99 % at low
threshold but drops drastically for
thresholds higher
than about 110 ADC counts for the unirradiated sensor
and 65 ADC counts for the sensor irradiated to (

The steep increase of lost tracks seems to be the major
drawback of the p-stop sensors and has to be further inves-
tigated. A possible improvement of the charge collection in
the inter-pixel region might be possible, if the pattern of the
resistive inter-pixel connections is changed. Every pixel should
not be coupled resistively to an overall network as indicated
in ﬁg. 3, but only to its direct neighbors. In this case also the
large spread of the signal charge in the unirradiated sensor
will be reduced. Such devices were already built and will be
investigated in the near future.

Abstract 

There  are  several  potential  advantages  for  a  collider 
operation  with  a 
lattice  with  negative  momentum 
compaction  factor  (alfa,  αc).  Since  the  lattice  of  the 
Frascati  e+e-  Φ-factory  DAΦNE  is  flexible  enough  to 
provide  collider  operation  even  with  alfa  <  0,  we  have 
exploited this possibility for an experimental study of the 
beam  dynamics.  The  negative  momentum  compaction 
lattices  have  been  successfully  implemented  and  stable 
1 A  currents  have  been  stored  in  both  electron  and 
positron  rings  without  any  problem  for  RF  cavities  and 
feedback  systems  operation.  First  collisions  have  been 
tested  at  low  currents.  In  this  paper  we  describe  the 
experimental results and compare them with expectations 
and numerical simulations. Present limitations to DAΦNE 
operation  with  alfa  <  0  and  ways  to  overcome  them  are 
also discussed. 

INTRODUCTION 

The e+e- collider DAΦNE, the 1.02 GeV c.m. Frascati 
Φ-factory  [1],  has  reached  a  peak  luminosity  of  about 
1.5x1032cm-2s-1  and  a  daily  integrated  luminosity  of 
10 pb-1  [2].  At  present  the  DAΦNE  Team  is  discussing 
several  scenarios  for  future  upgrades  [3]  and  different 
ideas aimed at increasing the luminosity are being studied 
theoretically and tested experimentally. One of such ideas 
which does not require additional costs since it relies only 
on  the  flexibility  of  the  lattice  is  to  realize  an  optical 
structure with a negative momentum compaction factor. 

There  are  several  potential  advantages  for  beam 
dynamics and luminosity performance of a collider with a 
negative momentum compaction factor: 

•  The bunch length is shorter since the wake potential 
is  focusing.  A  shorter  bunch  is  preferable  for  both 
peak  luminosity  and  beam-beam  lifetime  improve-
ment since the transverse beta functions at the inter-
action point (IP) can be reduced proportionally to the 
bunch length. Moreover, the Piwinski angle becomes 
lower  in  collisions  with  a  crossing  angle,  as  in  the 
case of DAΦNE. 

•  Qualitative  considerations  confirmed  by  numerical 
simulations  have  shown  that  a  lattice  with  negative 
momentum  compaction  can  make  the  longitudinal 
beam-beam effects less harmful [4], improving beam 
lifetime  and  decreasing  transverse  beam  size  blow 
up. Moreover, αc < 0 avoids coherent and incoherent 
instabilities arising when the longitudinal beam-beam 
kick gets comparable with the RF voltage [5]. 

•  It  has  been  shown  that  for  certain  vacuum  chamber 
coupling 
instability 
threshold  can  be  higher  with  negative  alfa  [6].  This, 
however,  has  not  been  confirmed  in  few  dedicated 

the  microwave 

impedances 

experiments [7, 8, and 9] and must be checked for the 
DAΦNE impedance. 

•  The  single  bunch  head-tail  instability  with  negative 
momentum  compaction  takes  place  with  positive 
chromaticity. This means that one can operate a stor-
age  ring  with  a  ‘natural’  negative  chromaticity 
without correcting sextupoles. 

Thus,  a  dedicated  machine  experiment  aimed  at 
studying DAΦNE performance with αc < 0 was scheduled 
and then performed with the following principal goals: 

•  to  check  the  reliability  of  the  lattice  model  by 
varying the momentum compaction in a wide range, 
•  to  prove  bunch  shortening  with  the  wake  fields  in 

DAΦNE and to study the microwave instability, 

•  to study RF cavities and feedbacks performance and 
to investigate the high current multibunch dynamics, 
•  to perform beam-beam collisions with negative alfa. 
This  paper  describes  the  obtained  results  and  analyzes 
the  experimental  data  comparing  them  with  expectations 
and numerical simulations. Present limitations to DAΦNE 
operation  with  negative  momentum  compaction  and 
possible ways to overcome them are also discussed.  

LATTICE MODIFICATION 
DAΦNE  is  a  double  ring  collider  sharing  two  interac-
tion regions; each ring consists of a long external arc and 
a short internal one based on a quasi-achromatic cell built 
using a bending-wiggler- bending sequence. The presence 
of the wiggler in the region of maximum dispersion dou-
bles the radiation emitted in the dipoles reducing damping 
times. Moreover the optics flexibility (all quadrupoles are 
independently  powered)  makes  it  possible  to  tune  the 
beam  emittance  by  varying  the  dispersion  in  the  wiggler 
at constant field.

αc=-0.019 (solid lines: modeling; dots: measurements). 

The  behaviour  of  the  dispersion  function  in  the  arcs 
determines  also  the  value  of  the  momentum  compaction 
factor  αc.  In  the  nominal  working  conditions  αc  =  0.02-
0.024,  but  this  parameter  can  be  easily  moved  toward 
negative  values  by  making  the  dispersion  function

arcs along the beam direction. The dispersion adjustments 
should preserve the transverse betatron functions and the 
relative  betatron  phase  advances  in  the  two  interaction 
regions and minimize their variation along the rings. This 
requires  a  general  reconfiguration  of  the  currents  in  all 
quadrupoles.  During  a  short  period  devoted  to  machine 
studies  two  different  value  of  αc  have  been  investigated: 
αc = -.02  (in  both  rings)  and  αc =  -.036  (only  in  the 
electron  ring).  After  applying  the  new  optics  with 
lattice 
negative  momentum  compaction  and  slight 
optimization  the  ring  has  been  completely  characterized 
by  measuring  betatron  functions,  first  and  second  order 
dispersion, chromaticity with  and without sextupoles and 
the  synchrotron  frequency  before  starting  systematic 
bunch  length  measurements.  The  optics  implementation 
and measurements required less than one day per ring. In 
both rings the experimental data are in a good agreement 
with  the  optics  model  both  for  the  linear  and  non-linear 
parts  [10].  As  an  example,  the  transverse  betatron 
functions and the dispersion measured in the positron ring 
are compared with the computed ones in Fig. 1. 

BEAM DYNAMICS 
Many  beam  dynamics  experiments,  including  bunch 
length  measurements,  study  of  high  current  multibunch 
operation and first beam-beam collisions, were performed 
with αc=-0.019 in  the positron ring  and αc=-0.021  in the 
electron one. The absolute values of the negative αc were 
chosen to be as close as possible to the positive one in the 
normal collider operating conditions. 

Bunch Shortening 

Impedances  and  wake  fields  are  well  known  for  both 
the  positron  [11]  and  the  electron  [12]  ring.  Numerical 
simulations  based  on  the  wake  fields  reproduce  well 
bunch length, charge distribution inside the bunch and the 
microwave  instability  threshold with positive momentum 
compaction. These wakes have been also used to simulate 
bunch  shortening  with  negative  alfa  [13].  According  to 
the  predictions  the  bunch  length  should  be  shorter  by 
50÷70% than in nominal operating conditions.  

In  order  to  confirm  these  predictions  the  bunch  length 
in  both  rings  has  been  measured  by  means  of  a  streak 
camera.  The  measurement  set  up  is  discussed  else-
where [14].  The  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  2  comparing 
bunch  length  for  positive  and  negative  αc.  It  can  be 
observed  that  the  bunch  is  substantially  shorter  with 
αc < 0, it shortens up to the microwave threshold and then 
starts  growing.  As  predicted  by  simulations,  for  the 
positron  ring  the  microwave  instability  threshold  is  only 
slightly lower than with the positive alfa: it is shifted from 
9÷10 mA  down  to  7  mA.  No  instability  sidebands  have 
been observed up to 16 mA/bunch which is higher than in 
the  present  working  conditions.  No  intensity  loss  due  to 
the  head-tail  instability  has  been  detected  for  positron 
bunch  currents  as  high  as  40 mA  with  high  negative 
chromaticities.

positron (left) and electron (right) rings (squares: positive 
alfa; circles: negative alfa). 

In the electron ring the bunch length is also shorter with 
the  negative  momentum  compaction,  but  the  microwave 
instability  threshold  is  significantly  lower  than  in  the 
positron  ring.  This  is  explained  by  the  larger  coupling 
impedance of the electron ring (by about a factor 2) [12]. 

Multibunch Operation 

The  RF  cavity  operation  with  negative  momentum 

compaction factor required only: 

•  change of the  RF phase by about 170 degree (1.3 ns 
in  time  units)  with  respect  to  the  injection  complex, 
since  the  synchronous  phase  in  this  case  is  on  the 
positive slope of the RF voltage; 

•  re-adjustment of the tuning loop to get a certain posi-
tive detuning of the accelerating mode frequency, i.e. 
to  provide  some  Robinson  damping  already  at  low 
current. 

High current operation in both rings has been tested by 
injecting 100 consecutive bunches (out of a maximum of 
120). No particular problem has been detected in manag-
ing  the  multibunch  dynamics.  Surprisingly,  feedbacks 
were not necessary  to store 400 mA in  the electron ring. 
In  order  to  obtain  about  1  A  of  stable  currents  in  both 
electron and positron beams the following procedures and 
set ups of the feedback systems have been applied: 

•  Longitudinal  feedback:  ‘standard’  FIR  filter  (broad-
band, ‘low gain’), front-end and back-end retiming in 
both rings. 

•  Vertical  feedback:  only  back-end  and  front-end 

retiming in both rings. 

•  Horizontal 

feedback:  back-end 

front-end 
retiming  only  in  the  positron  ring;  no  horizontal 
motion in the electron ring till about 1A. 

and 

The maximum storable currents at the level of 1 A were 
limited  by  injection  saturation.  Further  current  increase 
would  require  careful  adjustment  of  injection  closed 
bumps and dynamic aperture optimization. 

First Beam-Beam Collisions 

Optimization of beam-beam collisions has been carried 
out  at  low  beam  currents  (less  than  100  mA/beam)  by 
measuring  the  luminosity  as  a  function  of  calibrated 
vertical and horizontal bumps at the interaction point (IP). 
The  average  geometric  rms  beam  sizes  (Σx,y)  at  IP, 
extracted from these measurements, have been minimized 
by  adjusting  collider  parameters  such  as  tunes,  coupling, 

11,21,41,61,822,22,405101520I [mA]![cm]0,511,522,533,50510152025alfa < 0alfa > 0I [mA]![cm]beams overlap etc. After tuning we managed to reduce the 
vertical  capital  sigma  Σy  down  to  8.2  µm  and  the 
horizontal  one  to  1  mm.  These  Σx,y  are  comparable  with 
the  best  values  obtained  in  DAΦNE  with  positive 
momentum compaction. 

to  a  specific 

By  increasing  the  beam  currents  in  collision  the  best 
obtained  luminosity  was  2.5x1031cm-2s-1  while  colliding 
300  mA  electrons  against  300  mA  positrons.  This  result 
luminosity  of  2.5x1028 
corresponds 
cm-2s-1mA-2  defined  as  the  single  bunch  luminosity 
divided  by  the  product  of  colliding  bunch  currents.  One 
can  compare  this  number  with  the  typical  specific 
luminosity  in  high  current  collisions  in  DAΦNE  with 
αc > 0  which  ranges  between  1  and  1.5  in  units  of  1028 
cm-2s-1mA-2. However, such comparison is not conclusive 
since so far with αc<0 we did not collide as high currents 
as they are in routine DAΦNE operation with αc > 0. 

LIMITATIONS AND CURES 
The principal  limitation that forced us to  suspend high 
current  beam-beam  collisions  was  a  very  fast  growth  of 
the  electron  vertical  beam  size  above  a  threshold  of  3-4 
the 
mA  per  bunch.  A  strong  correlation  between 
longitudinal  microwave  instability  and  the  vertical  size 
blow  up  has  been  found.  As  can  be  seen  in  Fig.3,  the 
single  bunch  longitudinal  instability  threshold  at  about  3 
mA (a) corresponds to a vertical size blow up threshold at 
300 mA (b) for an electron beam of 90 bunches. 

 
Figure 3:  a)  Bunch length as a function of bunch current 
(solid  line:  simulations;  dots:  measurements);  b)  Vertical 
beam  size  as  a  function  of  beam  current  (90  bunches) 
without (blue) and after tune optimization. 

Such a correlation is not typical only for operation with 
αc<0,  but  it  has  been  also  detected  and  studied  for  the 
DAΦNE  routine  lattice  with  αc>0  [15].  However,  since 
the  microwave  threshold  is  lower  for  negative  alfa,  the 
effect  is  much  more  pronounced.  It  is  particularly  strong 
for the electron ring which has a higher impedance.  

The  only  way  to  overcome  this  limitation  is  to  move 
the  microwave  threshold  beyond  the  nominal  bunch 
current.  

Two ways are being followed to increase the threshold. 
First, during the current DAΦNE shutdown 2 m long ion 
clearing electrodes in the wiggler sections, which account 

 

for  almost  half  of  the  electron  ring  impedance  budget, 
will  be  removed.  Second,  according  to  the  Boussard 
criterion  [16],  the  threshold  increases  rapidly  with  the 
absolute value of the momentum compaction(Ith scales as 
3/2).  Exploiting  this  property,  one  day  before  the 
αc
shutdown a lattice with αc = -0.036 has been implemented 
(instead  of  –0.021)  with  encouraging  results  [17]:  the 
threshold  has  been  shifted  from  3  up  to  7÷8  mA/bunch 
while  the  bunch  length  at  the  nominal  bunch  current 
remained  by  50%  shorter  than  in  the  operational  lattice 
with  αc  >  0.  We  plan  to  resume  studies  of  the  negative 
momentum  compaction  beam  dynamics  after  the  shut 
down. 

SUMMARY 
•  The DAΦNE optics model has proved to be reliable in 
providing  collider  operation  with 
the  momentum 
compaction  factors  in  the  range  from  +0.034  [10]  to 
-0.036. 

•  With  negative  alfa  bunches  in  both  rings  shorten  as 
predicted by numerical simulations. It has been possible 
to  store  high  bunch  currents  with  large  negative 
chromaticities. 

•  No  hard  limit  has  been  seen  in  multibunch  operation. 
About  1  A  stable  currents  have  been  stored  in  both 
rings. 

•  At  beam  currents  up  to  300  mA/beam  a  good  specific 
luminosity has been obtained in beam-beam collisions. 
•  Higher  current  collisions  have  been  prevented  by  fast 
growth  of  the  electron  beam  vertical  size  with  current 
(single  beam  effect).  We  hope  to  overcome  this 
limitation  by  reducing  the  coupling  impedance  in  the 
electron ring and/or applying an optics with higher |αc|.

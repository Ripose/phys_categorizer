Abstract. Detecting H-antiH oscillations is intimately connected with the existence of natural antiH. We 

detect natural H-antiH oscillations, generated by a classical spin-free Coulomb quantum gap, which we 

calculate analytically without any parameter. Oscillation times are much smaller than those predicted with the 

Standard Model. These unprecedented results also remove the so-called problem with matter-antimatter 

asymmetry in the Universe.

Introduction 

According to recent results on the hydrogen-antihydrogen 4 particle system [1], our interest in the 

charge-conjugated Hamiltonians for charge-symmetrical HH and charge-anti-symmetrical HH systems 

H± = H0 ±∆H  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

led to a detailed study of long range behavior and of the role of anti-symmetry in few body systems 

[2]. This exercise, never done before [1], gives interesting results for physics and chemistry. We now 

report on an absolute proof, taken from [2], that H-H oscillations occur in nature. If a reversible H 

↔ H transition is (theoretically) allowed, baryon B and lepton L numbers are not conserved and the 

problem is shifted towards the conservation (non-conservation, breaking…) of B-L symmetry. This 

is why the detection of H-H oscillations is so important [3,4]. 

Radiation appears whenever a quantum system switches states, i.e. when it goes from state A with 

energy EA to state B with energy EB. Quantum theory relies on the simple but important relation 

hν= EA-EB=∆EA,B 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

where ∆EA,B is the quantum gap responsible for resonance hν. The sign of gap (2) seems irrelevant but 

for the physics of a system it is not: the energies of states A and B are important, including their sign 

with respect to a reference value like H0 in (1). For 4-fermion system bond H2, discrete Coulomb 

states HH and HH appearing in (1) have different energies (symmetries) [1]. Their energy difference, 

a classical Coulomb gap δ, should lead to emission/absorption of radiation, if and only if it is a quantum 

gap like (2). The well depth of a bond can be understood quantitatively with an asymptote much larger 

than the natural atomic threshold [1]. At longer range near atomic dissociation limit H0, oscillator 

behavior is distorted [1]. For this longer range close to the critical distance, the Heitler-London 

perturbation for state HH can, arbitrarily [1], be denoted as

+∆H = –e2/rAb–e2/rBa+e2/rab+ e2/rAB   

 

 

 

 

whereas the charge-conjugated mutually exclusive perturbation for state HH is then [1] 
-∆H = -(–e2/rAb–e2/rBa+e2/rab+ e2/rAB) = +e2/rAb+e2/rBa-e2/rab- e2/rAB 

With a 4 unit-charge model for H2, relations (3) may be exact, but solving them is a problem [1]. At 

long range, the simplest ordered 4-particle configuration possible is of parallel dipole type ↑……↑ for 

charge-symmetrical state HH and of anti-parallel dipole type ↑……↓ for charge-anti-symmetrical state HH 

(in the arrow, the point indicates the unit charge –1, the base +1). For this biaxial model1 to remain 

dynamic, the leptons must rotate in intra-atomic planes, separated by large rAB but perpendicular to 

this axis. Without polarization, an electrostatic description of (3) is possible, if the lepton phase 

difference is incorporated. This difference is zero in a cis model2 but can affect the potential (see 

below). In this report, we skip these effects as well as many others, dealt with in extenso in [2].  

With notation R=rAB, with the Bohr radius r for intra-atomic potentials r=rAa=rBb and knowing that 

at long range rab=rAB=R in this cis form, inter-atomic perturbations (3) simplify to 

+∆H = –2e2/√(R2 + r2) +2e2/R = +2(e2/R)[1-(1+(r/R)2)-½] 

-∆H = +2e2/√(R2 + r2) –2e2/R = -2(e2/R)[1-(1+(r/R)2)-½] 

Scaling with hartree3 e2/r and using scaled variable m=r/R gives relations of type N±(m) or 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

N+(m) = +2m[1 – (1+m2)-½] 
N-(m) = -2m[1 – (1+m2)-½] 

 

 

 

 

which should lead to the character (attractive or repulsive) of perturbations (3)-(5) in the cis model.  

This conceptually simple cis model is of plausible Bohr type [2], which makes its treatment parameter 

free and analytical. Errors for dipole-dipole interactions (5) will be comparable with those of Bohr theory. 

The difference between the charge-conjugated quantum states (5), Coulomb gap δ, will act as a quantum 

gap in the sense of (2), if it leads to radiation for allowed transitions (oscillations hν) between the states. 

The analytical form of the gap, solely due to charge-anti-symmetry, is generated by classical first principles only 

–Coulomb’s law- for the 4-fermion or 4 unit-charge system. In its analytical form 

δ(m) = N-(m)  - N+(m)= -4m[1 – (1+m2)-½] ~1/nα =hν/(e2/r) 

(6) 

this Coulomb gap will be tested below with the observed long range behavior, assessable with the 

band spectrum of 4-fermion system H2 [5]. This will finally show if H-H oscillations hν between 

states HH and HH, obeying Coulomb gap (6), occur in nature. Gap (6) is peculiar in that it is spin-

free: it is a pure Coulomb gap, due to the ambiguity of the spin- and charge-symmetries [1]. 

Using the available PEC (potential energy curve) of molecule H2 [5], observed level energies U(R) are 
scaled with the hartree3. The numerical relation of type u(m) is 

 

u (m) = [U(R) – U(∞)]/(e2/r) ~1/nα =hν/(e2/r)

1 This is the cis configuration used in [1] with 2 linear magnets kept in a parallel/anti-parallel alignment when brought together. 
2 These cis and trans notations for structures are common in stereochemistry [2] 
3 Scaling hν with the hartree gives hν/(e2/r)= 1/nα, where α is the fine structure constant and n de Broglie’s n=2πr/λ.

and is sufficiently accurate to allow the direct confrontation with (6) for the long range behavior of 

two neutral interacting species hydrogen. To extract data restricted to this long-range behavior for 

the reasons above and in [1] (see for instance the left side of its Fig. 4b), we select level energies for 

the 11 upper outer turning points in the PEC, close to natural threshold H0, the atomic dissociation 
limit. These 11 points at the attractive branch of the PEC are all between 17000 and 38000 cm-1 [5]. 

Their average of about 30000 cm-1 (1015 Hz) gives average oscillation times of 10-15 sec  (femtosec).  

It is important to realize that all equations above are analytical and absolutely parameter free. If the exact Bohr 

radius r is used (the measure for hartree 2R∞ in Rydberg, equivalent to absolute r=0,5291 Å), our 

calculations get ab initio status, despite the analytical simplicity of (6) and despite the simplicity of the 

geometrical model (dipole-dipole interactions, obeying the classical Coulomb law). 

Results and discussion 

- Character of charge-symmetrical and charge-anti-symmetrical perturbations (3): attractive or repulsive  

Results for states (5) in a cis mode are in Fig. 1. With the Coulomb classification (+ is repulsive, - is 

attractive), N+ (5a) or perturbation (3a) for charge-symmetrical cis HH is indeed repulsive as shown in [1] 

using different arguments (but see [2]). Mutually exclusive N- (5b) or conjugated perturbation (3b) for 

charge-anti-symmetrical cis HH is always attractive. This confirms our analysis in [1]. 

Despite the absolute neutrality constraint for neutral 4 unit-charge systems, it is nevertheless possible 

to generate a Coulomb operator like in (1) to distinguish between 2 different absolutely neutral states, one being 

internally charge-symmetric, the other internally charge-anti-symmetric. Because of Coulomb’s law, this result 

in (1) is absolute and exact. However, for 2 unit-charge systems, this generic possibility is excluded, since 

+- ≡ -+ for the same charge separation. With only 2 fermions and Coulomb’s law in Bohr atom 

theory, antisymmetry can never provoke Coulomb splitting like it does in (1), as argued in [1]. 

The character of HH and HH is reversed in the trans mode, with a maximum lepton phase difference 
of 180° or π rad. Here, Coulomb repulsion +e2/rab between the charge-symmetrical leptons, is attenuated 
[1]: for trans, rab=√(R2+4r2), whereas rab=R for cis. For charge-anti-symmetrical states, the extension 
is straightforward. The complete analysis shows that the absolute values of the potentials are always 

larger in cis than in trans, since biaxial trans is asymmetric but not anti-symmetric (full details are in [2]).  

- Detection of natural H-H oscillations in the stable hydrogen molecule 

An algebraic sign for both (6) and (7) gives the position of predicted (6) and observed (7) levels 

relative to natural threshold H0. For (7) this means that the threshold is fixed at u(m) = 0 and that all 

11 levels considered are at the negative (attractive) side of this threshold.

The results for long range behavior in molecule hydrogen are in Fig. 2, where δ(m) (6) is plotted versus u(m) 

(7). A line fit

(8) 

has a goodness of fit R2 = 0,995. This absolute ab initio result is completely in line with quantum theory (2) 

for Coulomb gap (6). To the best of my knowledge, (8) is an unprecedented new result, which throws 

a completely new light on the mechanism responsible for chemical bonding, especially in prototype 

molecule H2, completely in line with our earlier results [1]. 

In fact, observed long-range behavior (8) needs an even distribution of the 4 elementary particles as 4 

= 2+2 [1]. This Atoms in Molecules (AIM) approach is gradually replaced with an odd distribution 4 

=3+1, an Ions in Molecules (IIM) approach at closer range due to the Kratzer-potential, as argued 

earlier [1,6]. The transition between 2+2 and 3+1 configurations at intermediate baryon separation 

leads to a smooth inflection point in the attractive branch of the PEC, not in its repulsive branch [1]. 

But unexpected result (8) also shows that the long-range forces behind all molecular band spectra are 

atom-antiatom oscillations generated by classical Coulomb quantum gap (6), deriving solely from charge-anti-

symmetry [1]. These oscillations obey3 de Broglie’s standing wave equation (7), conform (2) and are 

confined to the region of femtochemistry (see below). These and many other consequences of anti-

symmetry for chemistry are in [2]. Here, we suffice by remarking that 

(i) 

the energy of the lowest level in Fig. 2 is 17420 cm-1. This shows that the validity of our 

simple model, intended solely for long-range behavior, is even better in reality as it applies to 

about half the well depth (38000 cm-1) and that 

(ii) 

 the intercept in (8) shows that, at very large rAB (1/rAB ≈ 0), the 4-fermion system is not yet 

completely ordered as in the discrete cis model we used throughout at all the larger rAB-values 

(due, in the first place, to disordering of the cis arrangement by thermal agitation [2]).  

Ab initio result (8) is at least as remarkable and unprecedented for physics as it is for chemistry, since 

we detect a direct signature for non-annihilation of neutral matter H and neutral antimatter H, the same 

unconventional viewpoint as in [1]. This fits in evidence for complex annihilation patterns of heavier 

particle pairs [8], in clear contrast with the simple annihilation process for the electron-positron pair.  

First, we not only prove that natural H-H oscillations really occur (8) but also that their oscillation 

times in a natural 4-fermion conglomerate are of order 10-15 sec, exactly the femtochemistry region 

where longer range chemical interactions, under study here, take place [9]. This contrasts with SM estimates 

for H-H oscillations of 1020 sec [3,4]. The ratio of SM H-H oscillation times and those occurring in 

nature, as proved by (8), is an incredibly large number 1020/10-15=1035! This can never be due to a 

small error in one or more of the many parameters in the Standard Model [10,11]. We suspect that 

the larger part of this enormous divergence stems from the fact that natural H-H oscillations are 

embedded within a natural and stable 4-fermion system H2=HH, a possibility never considered 

previously [1]. Moreover, it is known for long that difficulties with 4-fermion theories were, amongst 

G. Van Hooydonk, H-H oscillations... first version July 01 2005

others, at the origin of the SM [12]. But the ab initio status of important parameter free result (8) for 4-

fermion systems can never be overlooked. If H is really an ultimate test for the Standard Model as 

claimed frequently, the SM has certainly not withstood the absolute test with the detected natural H-H 

oscillations reported here. If confirmed, result (8) seems to be the first one, which directly flaws the 

highly praised but over-parameterized Standard Model [10-11]. 

Second, with respect to matter-antimatter asymmetry [13], we proved earlier that matter (H) is 

different from antimatter (H) [1,14]. Since our bold and unprecedented thesis [1,6] that molecule H2 

= HH is not only confirmed but even proved with (8), the amounts of matter (H) and antimatter (H) 

must be exactly equal on purely classical stochiometric grounds. Since hydrogen is the most abundant species in 

the Universe, this great cosmological question [13] is answered, as argued in [1].  

Working with Hamiltonians without wave functions, which is working with classical physics [1], is 

remarkably effective for ab initio calculations on difficult quantum problems. Signature (8) is also 

surprising, in that it is obtained without spin and its symmetries [1]. 

 

 

Conclusion 

as possible [1]. 

The present absolute proof that natural H-H oscillations exist, combined with the results in [1], confirms 

that the dogmatic ban on natural H in theoretical physics and chemistry will have to be lifted as soon

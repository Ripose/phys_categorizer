The  relationships  among  various  parameters  describing  the  strength  of 
optical transitions in atoms and molecules are reviewed.  The application 
of  these  parameters  to  the  description  of  the  interaction  between  nearly 
monochromatic, directional light beams and atoms and molecules is given 
careful  attention.    Common  pitfalls  in  relating  these  parameters  are 
pointed  out.    This  is  a  revised  (February,  2002)  version  of  a  paper  that 
originally appeared in Am. J. Phys. 50, 982–986 (1982). 

 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Several  parameters  are  commonly  used  to  describe  the  strength  of  atomic  and 
molecular  optical  transitions.    The  Einstein  A and  B coefficients,  f  values  (also  called 
“oscillator  strengths”),  and  transition  dipole  moments  are  all  atomic  and  molecular 
parameters related to the “strength” of the transition.  In many practical situations, on the 
other  hand,  it  is  useful  to  define  an  absorption  coefficient  (or  for  lasers,  a  gain 
coefficient)  to  describe  the  absorption  (or  amplification)  of  a  beam  of  light  passing 
through a medium consisting of the atoms or molecules of interest. 
 
From  a  “kinetics”  point  of  view,  the  absorption  or  scattering  of  radiation  is 
described  as  a  reaction  or  scattering  process  and  the  probability  of  absorption  or 
scattering is given in terms of a cross section.  It is the purpose of this paper to review the 
relationships  among  these  descriptions  of  the  light-matter  interaction  and  to  point  out 
common pitfalls in using these relationships. 
An  examination  of  books1-7  dealing  with  light- matter  interaction  shows  a  wide 
 
variety  of  expressions  relating  these  parameters.    Differences  among  these  expressions 
involving  factors  of  2p,  eo,  etc.,  of  course,  can  be  traced  to  differing  units  used  in  the 
definitions of the parameters.   However, these differences are often exacerbated because 
many  different  (and  often  not  clearly  defined)  measures  of  light  “intensity”  are  used  in 
the definitions of the parameters. 
 
Further  difficulties  arise  when  these  parameters  are  applied  to  some  practical 
problems.    The  careful  reader  notes  that  the  relationships  among  these  parameters  are 
almost always derived under the assumption that the atom is interacting with an isotropic, 
unpolarized,  broad-band  (wide  frequency  range)  light  field.    This  careful  reader  is  then

wary  of  applying  these  parameters  to  describe  the  interaction  between  atoms  and 
directional, polarized, nearly monochromatic light beams. 
 
Although this paper contains no new results, I believe that a unified discussion of 
the relationships among these parameters will prove to be of value to students, teachers, 
and  researchers.    For  simplicity,  the  discussion  will  be  limited  to  isolated  atoms  (e.g., 
atoms  in  a  low-density  gas  or  in  an  atomic  beam)  and  to  an  isolated  electric  dipole 
transitio n  between  an  upper  level  labeled  2,  and  a  lower  level  labeled  1.    I  will  use  the 
word “atom” generically to mean the material system of interest.  The index of refraction 
of  the  surrounding  medium  is  assumed  to  be  unity.    SI  units  are  used  throughout  the 
paper. 
 
II. ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT AND ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION 
 

Let us begin the discussion by defining a phenomenological absorption coefficient 
)a w .    For  a  beam  of  light  propagating  in  the  x  direction,  the  absorption  coefficient  is 
defined by the expression 

(

where  i(w)  is  some  measure  of  the  power  in  the  light  beam  at  the  frequency  w.    (The 
power  is  actually  a  time-averaged  quantity,  averaged  over  several  optical  cycles.)    In 
most  practical  applications,  the  frequency  dependence  of  the  absorption  and  emission 
processes  is  important.    In  this  paper,  it  is  assumed  that  all  of  these  frequency 
dependencies can be expressed in terms of a line shape function g(w).  The normalization 
of g(w) is chosen so that 

+¥

 .  

(Having  the  lower  limit  of  the  normalization  integral  be  -
  greatly  simplifies  the 
normalization  calculation.    Negative  frequencies  have  no  special  physical  significance.)   
If  the  atoms  are  undergoing  collisions  (leading  to  collision  broadening  of  the  spectral 
line)  or  moving  about  (leading,  in  general,  to  Doppler  broadening),  then  g(w) describes 
the appropriate ensemble-average line shape. 
Note that  g(w)  has  the  dimensions  of  1/angular  frequency.    One  of  the  common 
 
pitfalls  lies  in  not  explicitly  recognizing  which  independent  variable  is  being  used  to 
describe the frequency or wavelength dependence.  In this paper, angular frequency will 
be used except where noted. 
We expect a
 
(w) to be proportional to the number  n1 of  atoms in level 1 (per unit 
volume)  that  the  beam  intercepts.    (We  assume  that  stimulated  emission  effects  are 
negligible.8)  The absorption cross section sa(w) is then defined by

The frequency- integrated parameters are of limited practical usefulness.  They can 
be  used  to  describe  the  absorption  and  scattering  of  a  beam  of  light  whose  frequency 
bandwidth  is  large  compared  to  the  width  of  g(w).    In  most  cases,  however,  we  are 
interested in the behavior of light beams whose bandwidth is on the order of, or less than, 
the width of g(w).  In those cases, we must use a
 
III. EINSTEIN COEFFICIENTS 
 
In  1917  Einstein  introduced  A  and  B  coefficients  to  describe  spontaneous 
 
emission and induced absorption and emission.  The Einstein  A coefficient is defined in 
sW  from an upper level 2 to a lower level 
terms of the total rate of spontaneous emission 
1 for a system of N2 atoms in the upper level:

where  w21  is  the  resonance  frequency  of  the  transition.    g1 and  g2  are  the  degeneracy 
factors  of  the  two  levels.9   As  usual,  h   is  Planck’s  constant  divided  by  2p and  c  is  the 
speed  of  light.    Note  that  the  Bs,  so  defined,  are  independent  of  the  details  of  the  line 
shape  g(w) because 
wr   is  assumed  to  be  spectrally  flat  over  the  region  in  which  g(w) 
varies significantly. 
It  is  important  to  recognize  that  a  different  relation  between  the  A  and  B 
 
coefficients is found if some other measure of the radiation energy density is used.  For 
fr   (energy  density  per  unit  frequency  interval),  then  since

To  illustrate  the  differences  that  occur  in  the  literature,  three  examples  of  the 
relationships of the Einstein A and B coefficients are quoted.  (The subscript notation has 
been standardized.)  From Herzberg (Ref. 5, p. 21), we find

One difference among the derivations of these relations is obvious:  Herzberg defines B 
in terms of radiation density per unit wavenumber interval while Yariv and Mihalas use 
radiation density per unit frequency interval.  That difference accounts for a factor of  c3 
(since 
)  between  Herzberg  and  Yariv.    The  remaining  factor  of  c  difference 
between  Herzberg  and  Yariv  arises  because  Herzberg  defines  B  in  terms  of  irradiance 
(power  per  unit  area  and  per  unit  wavenumber)  incident  on  the  atom,  while  Yariv  uses 
energy per unit volume and per unit frequency interval at the location of the atom.  The 
factor of c/4p difference between Mihalas and Yariv arises because Mihalas has extracted 
a factor of 4p in the definition of his  B in terms of “specific intensity” (power per area 
and per solid angle and per frequency interval). 
 
The lesson to be learned here is that before one can make use of the formulas for 
A  and  B  coefficients  from  a  particular  source,  one  must  carefully  determine  which 
measure  of  radiation  intensity  has  been  used.    In  fact,  in  the  references  cited  above  the 
same word “intensity” is used to signify three quite distinct physical quantities. 
 
IV.  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  THE  EINSTEIN  COEFFICIENTS  AND  THE 
ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION

Another pitfall lies in trying to apply the  B coefficients directly to the analysis of 
 
the behavior of nearly monochromatic, directed beams of light.  Since most texts provide 
an  inadequate  treatment  of  this  important  application,  the  problem  is  discussed  here  in 
some detail. 

To relate the  B coefficients to the absorption cross section (or alternatively, to the 
absorption  coefficient),  we  need  to  define  B  coefficients  for  monochromatic  and  for 
directed radiation.  The careful reader will have already noted that the B coefficients were 
defined  above  in  terms  of  a  broadband,  isotropic  radiation  field.    We  first  consider  the 
case of a monochromatic (but still isotropic) field and define the induced absorption rate 
due to radiation in the angular frequency range from w to w + dw to be

We now turn to the case of directional radiation.  In many practical situations, in 
 
particular  when  dealing  with  radiation  transfer  or  lasers,  it  is  useful  to  express  the 
transition  rates  in  terms  of  the  irradiance  (time-averaged  power  per  unit  area)  of  a 
directional beam of light.  Classical and quantum- mechanical  calculations  show that for 
electric dipole transitions the absorption and stimulated emission rates depend only on the 
square of the amplitude of the electric field at the location of the atom (and of course on 
the polarization and frequency spectrum of the light).  Hence, as long as the directional 
beam  produces  the  same  energy  density  (proportional  to  the  electric  field  amplitude 
squared) at the location of the atom as does the isotropic field, the transition rate will be 
the same (taking polarization into account). 
 
 
 , 
where eo, as usual, is the permittivity of free space. 
 
For a nearly monochromatic directional beam, the irradiance can be expressed in 
terms of an integral of r(w), the energy density in the angular frequency interval between 
w and w + dw:

Thus  the  following  expressions  relate  the  absorption  cross  section  to  the  Einstein  B 
coefficient: 

In arriving at Eq.  (26),  we  have  assumed  that  g(w)  is  sharply  peaked  at  w21,  and  hence 
that we may replace w by w21 when carrying out the integration over frequency. 
 
We now consider the absorption process from the point of view of photons.  Let 
R12 denote the number of absorption events per unit time and per photon of frequency  w.

For an electric dipole (“allowed”) transition for a stationary, isolated atom,  g(w21)A21 is 
often on the order of unity.  Hence, the line center absorption cross section is on the order 
21l .  We are led to picture the “collision” between a photon and an atom as a collision 
of 
21l , and an atom that is small 
between a fuzzy ball (the photon) of radius about equal to 
compared to 
 
For  other  multipole  transitions,  for  example,  for  magnetic  dipole  and  electric 
quadrupole transitions, the product g(w21)A21 may be much smaller than unity if the upper 
level  can  decay  via  electric  dipole  transitions  to  other  levels.    Hence,  the  cross  section 
will  be  correspondingly  smaller.    Obviously,  for  those  other  multipole  transitions,  the 
fuzzy ball picture of the photon is not appropriate11. 
 
V. OSCILLATOR STRENGTH (f VALUE) 
 
 
Oscillator  strengths  (f values) may be defined by comparing the emission rate or 
absorption  rate  of  the  atom  with  the  emission  or  absorption  rate  of  a  classical,  single-
electron  oscillator  (with  oscillation  frequency  w21).    We  define  an  emission  oscillator 
strength f21 by the relation2

Note that we have used subscripts on the oscillator strength  f21 to distinguish it from the 
transition frequency.  Here,  m is the mass of the electron.  The classical radiative decay 
rate  of  the  single-electron  oscillator  at  frequency  w21  is  given  by  gcl.    An  absorption 
oscillator strength f12 is then defined by

The  fs  have  been  defined  so  that  if  (a)  g2  =  3  (that  is,  the  angular  momentum 
quantum number J2 of the upper level is equal to unity), (b) g1 = 1 (that is, J1 = 0), and (c) 
the Einstein A coefficient is equal to the classical decay rate (A21 = gcl), then the resulting 
absorption f value f12 is equal to unity and f21 = –1/3.  Tables of gf values for many atomic 
transitions have been compiled.12-14  We may now relate the absorption oscillator strength 
to the A value:

VII. RABI FREQUENCY 
 
 
In many applications involving the interaction of laser radiation with atomic and 
molecular  systems,  coherent  effects  are  important.    For  example,  the  population 
difference  in  a  two- level  system  driven  by  a  beam  of  coherent  radiation  oscillates  in 
time16-18  with  an  angular  frequency  called  the  “Rabi  frequency.”    The  more  intense  the 
light  source,  the  more  rapidly  the  population  difference  oscillates.    The  Rabi  frequency 
for on-resonance excitation (when the frequency  w of exciting light equals the resonance 
frequency  w21)  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  electric  field  amplitude  of  the  linearly 
polarized 
the  following 
expression17,18: 
 

21
If the upper level and lower level are degenerate, there may be several Rabi frequencies, 
one for each value of 
.  In that case, the dynamical behavior of the system 
may be quite complicated.18 
 
authors  make  use  of  the  so-called  rotating-wave approximation, in which 
.  Terms with a time dependence

the equations of motion.  In terms of E, the Rabi frequency is 
 

Some  confusion  in  the  definition  of  the  Rabi  frequency  occurs  because  many

VIII. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE AND COMMENTS 
 
 
It is instructive to evaluate the parameters described above for a particular atomic 
transition.  We consider the calcium resonance transition at l21(air) = 422.7 nm (w21 = 4.5 
 1015 rad/s).  The upper level (4 1P) has a radiative lifetime of 4.5 ns.  The lower level is 
4 1S.  For our purposes, we may ignore the other possible decay routes, for example, from

4 1P to 3 1D.  For this transition,  A21 = 1/tspon = 2.2 x 108 s–1.  The degeneracy factors are 
g2 = 3 and g1 = 1.  We now evaluate the parameters to two digit precision:

 0.20.  The close agreement 
between  the  measured  value  and  the  value  calculated  neglecting  branching  to  the  3  1D 
level confirms the assumption of the smallness of that branching ratio. 
 
Note that the line center absorption cross section (as mentioned previously) turns 
out to be close to l 2 (l 2 = 1.8 x 107 Å2).  The transition dipole moment agrees with the 
expected  order-of- magnitude  estimate  of  an  electron  charge  times  a  typical  atomic 
distance. 
 
Finally,  we  calculate  the  electric  field  amplitude  (and  corresponding  irradiance), 
which  makes  the  Rabi  frequency  equal  to  the  natural  radiative  decay  rate.    It  can  be 
shown6  that  this  is  roughly  the  field  that  is  required  to  “saturate”  the  atomic  transition.   
Using the values given above we find E @ 103 V/m and I @
All of the results developed in this paper for atoms can be immediately applied to 
 
the individual rotational transitions of molecules if the appropriate degeneracy (statistical 
weight)  factors  are  used.21,22    The  definitions  of  transition  dipole  moment  and  line 
strength  used  here  are  the  same  as  those  recently  recommended  for  the  description  of 
diatomic molecular spectra.22

books  listed  in  Refs.  2-7  particularly  useful.    Their  treatments  of  these  parameters  are  typical  of  the 

discussions  found  in  other  books.    Reference  3  contains  a  reasonably  comprehensive  discussion  of  these 

parameters.    The  discussion  here  differs  from  that  in  Ref.  3  particularly  in  the  treatment  of  f values and 

dipole moments.  Reference 3 does not mention  “Rabi frequency.”

9Unfortunately, the symbol  g is used in the literature for both the line shape  g(w), and for the degeneracy 
factors. 
10As an aside, I point out that many authors use “intensity” to calculate the absorption rate.  Usually, but by 

no means universally, intensity turns out to be what is more properly called the “spectral radiance” of the 

light beam, i.e., the power per unit area and per unit angular frequency range and per unit solid angle.  The 

spectral radiance R(w) in the solid range dW is related to i(w) by the expression R(w)dW/4p = i (w).  Physics 
indicates  that  it  is   r(w)d w  not  R(w),  which  is  important  in  determining  the  transition  rates.    Spectral 

radiance  is  most  useful  in  radiation  transfer  problems  dealing  with  nearly isotropic environments such as 

stellar atmospheres. 
11 If the upper-level can decay only to the ground state by a higher-order multipole transition and if there is 

no significant collisional or Doppler broadening, then g(w21) A21 can be of order unit and the fuzzy photon 
picture still holds.  I thank P. Nachman for pointing out this possibility.

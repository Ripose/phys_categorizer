GAUGE-POTENTIAL APPROACH TO THE KINEMATICS OF A MOVING CAR

A kinematics of the motion of a car is reformulated in terms of the theory of gauge potentials. E(2)-gauge

structure originates in the no-slipping contact of the car with a road.

The physically most important ﬁeld where the mathematical theory of connections (↔ gauge potentials ↔
Yang-Mills potentials) is used with great success is undoubtedly the theory of elementary particles. Since,
however, the concepts involved are rather abstract and (especially for a newcomer in the ﬁeld) mixed with a
number of other (equally abstract) ones, one should appreciate to ﬁnd out that gauge potentials can be used
in ’much more mundane, but in return more readily visualized, context’ [1], too, viz. in the context of classical
mechanics [1],[3],[4],[5] or hydrodynamics [2]. A nice example of this sort is given in [1] (cf.also [3]). It was
shown there that the natural kinematical framework for computing the net rotation of a (deformable) body due
to a sequence of deformations is the non-Abelian gauge structure over the space of shapes of the body.

In this paper we show that (and rather in detail how) the kinematics of a motion of a car on a road can be
reformulated in terms of non-Abelian gauge potentials, too. The gauge group is E(2), the Euclidean group of
the translations and rotations of the 2-dimensional plane.

It should be noted that the diﬀerential geometric treatment of the car’s kinematics was given before in [6].
The new point here is the addition of the degree of freedom α (see Sec.2) which makes it possible then to treat
the problem in the language of connections.

Finally let us mention a technical simpliﬁcation made in computations. As is well known, the front (as well
as rear) wheels of a car do not rotate with the same angular velocity in general (the device called diﬀerential is
needed). When we speak about the angle α as being the angle measuring the orientation of the front wheel, the
average angle is understood in fact. Or, equivalently, we compute everything as if the car was a tricycle (then
α is the angle of the front wheel). The full account of the situation with two wheels can be done, of course, but
it does not bring anything conceptually new.

2. The conﬁguration space of a car as a principal E(2)-bundle

Let P be the conﬁguration space of a car. The coordinates (α, β, x, y, ϕ) are introduced according to the
Fig.1, Fig.2, with the following meaning : (x, y) are the Cartesian coordinates of the center of the front axle,
ϕ is the angle between the x1 axis and the tie rod (’if that is the name of the thing connecting the front and
rear axles’ [6]; it measures the direction in which the car is headed), α measures the orientation of the front
wheel with respect to the axle and β is the angle made by the front axle with the tie rod. Thus (x, y, ϕ) carry
the information about the position of the tie rod alone in the x1x2 - plane irrespective of the ’shape’ of the car
whereas (α, β) encode the car’s shape regardless of the position of the tie rod in the x1x2 - plane.

There is a natural action of the Euclidean group E(2) on P , consisting in ’rigid’ motions (rotations and
translations) of the car with no change of its shape, that is to say the motions of the tie rod keeping the shape
ﬁxed. This action RB : P → P (see Appendix A for more technical details) results in the additional structure
of the space P , viz. the structure of a principal ﬁber bundle with the group E(2). It is constructed as follows
: two conﬁgurations p, p′ ∈ P are declared to be equivalent if they diﬀer only by a rigid motion from E(2), i.e.
if there exists such (B, b) ∈ E(2) that the action of (B, b) on p results in p′, i.e. RBp = p′. We deﬁne then
M as the factor-space P/E(2), i.e. the points of M are by deﬁnition the equivalence classes in P . There is a
projection map

sending the conﬁguration p to its own equivalence class [p] ≡ π(p) = m, or in coordinates

π : P → M

π : (α, β, x, y, ϕ) 7→ (α, β)

Thus π extracts from the complete conﬁguration the information about the shape of the car and ’forgets’ the
position of the tie rod within the x1x2 - plane.

According to the terminology of [1],[2], P is the space of ’located shapes’ whereas M is the space of ’unlocated

shapes’.

If m ∈ M , the set π−1(m) ⊂ P (all those p ∈ P which project to the ﬁxed m ∈ M ) is called the ﬁber over
m and here it represents all conﬁgurations (≡ ’located shapes’) sharing the same (’unlocated’) shape. Any two
ﬁbers π−1(m), π−1(m′) are mutually diﬀeomorphic (equally looking) and their abstract model, the typical ﬁber,
is denoted by E (the space of the locations of the tie rod) in Appendix A and happens to be diﬀeomorphic to
the group E(2) itself.

Notice that the knowledge of the conﬁguration p ∈ P is equivalent (globally) to the knowledge of the ordered
pair (m, e) ∈ M × E. In other words our total space P of the bundle is (diﬀeomorphic to) the product M × E
of the base M and the typical ﬁber E

P = M × E

3

and the bundle projection π is realized as a projection π1 on the ﬁrst factor

π1 : M × E → M

(m, e) 7→ m

This means that our bundle is trivial (in general this is the case only locally).
The section of the bundle π : P → M (the ﬁxation of the gauge) is a map

obeying

σ : M → P

π ◦ σ = identity on M

(σ(m) is to be in the ﬁber over m). It helps to visualize the abstract shapes (elements of M ) localizing each of
them somewhere in the x1x2 - plane. The convenient (global) section is given in coordinates by

σ : (α, β) 7→ (α, β, 0, 0, 0)

(2.1)

It realizes all shapes by means of the conﬁgurations with the tie rod situated at the x1-axis to the left with
respect to the origin (Fig.3). Notice that the coordinates (x, y, ϕ) are closely related (adapted) to this very
section (in fact they are introduced just with respect to this section) : the section deﬁnes (for all m ∈ M ) the
ﬁducial point σ(m) in the ﬁber over m. This point is (by deﬁnition) labeled by the coordinates (α, β, 0, 0, 0).
Then a general point p in the same ﬁber (with the same shape) acquires the coordinates (α, β, x, y, ϕ) if the
element (B, b) ∈ E(2) with

is needed to obtain p from σ(m) via the group action.

The useful possibility is to interpret the section (2.1) as the point of view of the driver (the driver’s reference
system) : with respect to his axes x′
2 the tie rod is clearly always at the origin and directed forward
(x = y = ϕ = 0). Each other choice of a section (other gauge) corresponds to some diﬀerent observer, which
can, however, depend on the (unlocated) shape.

3. The no-slipping contact with a road as a connection on π : P → M

So far we have come to conclusion that the 5-dimensional conﬁguration space P of a car can be treated
naturally as a total space of a (trivial) principal E(2)-bundle π : P → M , P ≡ M × E. A motion of the car on
a road (x1x2-plane) is given by a curve γ(t) ≡ (m(t), e(t)) on P ≡ M × E. The essential point is, however, that
it is only the projection m(t) ≡ π ◦ γ(t) which is under direct control of a driver (α(t) - gas pedal, braces; β(t)

4

- steering wheel). The driver governs directly the ’motion’ in the space of shapes M (the base of the bundle)
whereas what is really his goal is the change of the position of the tie rod, or in other words to move along
the desired curve e(t) in the typical ﬁber E of the bundle. The necessary ’bridge’ between M and E is given
by a system of (anholonomic) diﬀerential constraints representing physically the condition of the no-slipping
contact of the wheels with the road. In such a way the driver’s activity represented as the curve m(t) on M is
transformed to the curve e(t) on E or, equivalently, γ(t) ≡ (m(t), e(t)) on P . As we will see, the procedure of the
reconstruction of the complete γ(t) on P from its projection m(t) on M is just the horizontal lift m 7→ mh ≡ γ,
where the structure necessary for it, viz. the connection in the principal bundle π : P → M (gauge structure
over M) enters the scene as a mathematical expression of the above mentioned no-slipping contact of the car
with the road, i.e. the constraints of contact can be interpreted in terms of the connection form on P .

In general a connection on a principal ﬁber bundle π : P → M with a group G is given [7] by a G-valued (G
being the Lie algebra of the group G) 1-form on P , a connection form. In our case it means the 3 × 3 matrix
of 1-forms on P decomposable with respect to the basis e0, e1, e2 of the Lie algebra e(2) of the group E(2) (see
Appendix B)

where ω0, ω1, ω2 are 1-forms on P . Thus the condition of the horizontality

ω = 0

i.e.

ω0 = ω1 = ω2 = 0

represents just 3 independent relations between the diﬀerentials dα, dβ, dx, dy, dϕ enabling one to express the
inﬁnitesimal changes δx, δy, δϕ of the coordinates of the rod in terms of the given changes δα, δβ of the coordi-
nates of the shape of the car.

Note : the equations ωa = 0 are not to be interpreted as 1-form identities on P but rather in the sense that
the forms are annihilated (give zero) by the velocity (≡ tangent) vectors to the real (≡ obeying the constraints
⇒ by deﬁnition horizontal) trajectories on P .

The computation of the explicit expression for the connection form is performed in Appendix C. The result

reads

4. Reconstruction of γ(t) on P from π(γ(t)) on M as a horizontal lift

The driver’s activity is represented by a curve m(t) ≡ π(γ(t)) on M (a sequence of shapes parametrized by
time). The contact of the wheels with the road results then in a motion in the total conﬁguration space P .
According to the meaning of the connection as an object encoding all constraints of the contact, the resulting
trajectory γ(t) on P is the horizontal lift of the curve m(t), i.e. the unique curve mh(t) on P enjoying the
following two properties :

5

(4.1)

(4.3)

(4.4)

i) π(mh(t)) = m(t) ↔ mh(t) is always exactly ’over’ m(t)
ii) ˙mh ≡ its tangent (velocity) vector - is always horizontal, i.e. it annihilates ωa, a = 0, 1, 2.
Let us express these conditions in coordinates. If

is given, then its horizontal lift is

m(t) ↔ (α(t), β(t))

mh(t) ↔ (α(t), β(t), x(t), y(t), ϕ(t)).

(the same α and β are there because of the condition i); x, y, ϕ are to be determined). Now

˙mh(t) = ˙α(t)∂α + ˙β(t)∂β + ˙x(t)∂x + ˙y(t)∂y + ˙ϕ(t)∂ϕ

< ωa, ˙mh(t) > = 0

a = 0, 1, 2

are the horizontal lifts of the coordinate basis vectors on M .

The 1-st order linear autonomous system of equations (4.1), the parallel transport equations, solves the
reconstruction problem : given α(t), β(t) for t ∈< ti, tf > (sequence of shapes) and (x(ti), y(ti), ϕ(ti) (the
initial position in the ﬁbre over m(ti), i.e. the initial position of the car on the road), it provides the remaining
information about the motion of the car, viz. the sequence of the positions of the tie rod corresponding to the
given sequence of shapes (an example - the motion with the ﬁxed steering wheel - is computed in Appendix D).
The parallely transported conﬁguration is then by deﬁnition the conﬁguration mh(tf ). (Recall that according
to the meaning of the connection here to follow the parallel transport rule is the same thing as to be compatible
with the constraints of the contact).

Note that the equations (4.1) are invariant (as is the case in general for the parallel transport equations)
with respect to reparametrization - the speed of the shape sequence is irrelevant, what matters is only the path
corresponding to m(t) rather then the curve m(t) itself. Surprisingly, this rather subtle technical fact seems to
be pretty well known intuitively to our wives when they prevent us to drive too quickly (’you win nothing by
it’).

5. Parking cycles as a clever use of the curvature Ω of the connection

To get out of an extremely tight parking spot [6] a pure translation of the tie rod perpendicular to the latter,

i.e. (inﬁnitesimally)

(x, y, ϕ) 7→ (x − ǫ sin ϕ, y + ǫ cos ϕ, ϕ)

(5.1)

(ǫ ≪ 1) is strongly desirable lest we come to contact with the neighbouring car (and even much worse with the
owner of the neighbouring car, then).

On the other hand according to the results of Sec.4. only the motions generated by some horizontal lift ˙mh

are possible (allowed by the constraints), i.e. (cf. (4.2) - (4.4))

(x, y, ϕ) 7→ (x + ǫcos(ϕ + β), y + ǫ sin(ϕ + β), ϕ +

sin β)

(5.2)

ǫ
l

6

(ǫ = ˙αRδt ≪ 1). In no special case (5.2) reduces to (5.1) : (5.2) consists of both translation and rotation except
for the case β = 0, when, however, the translation is just along the tie rod. Thus it seems that we are simply
unlucky and we have to wait until the car in front of us leaves.

This conclusion is, however, too hasty, since we have not used yet the basic parking algorithm known to
every driver, viz. a cycle in the space M . Let us study for a moment the result of an inﬁnitesimal cycle of the
following structure (see Fig.4) :
i) go forth (α 7→ α + ǫ)
ii) turn the steering wheel to the left (β 7→ β + ǫ)
iii) go (the same step) back (α + ǫ 7→ α)
iv) turn the steering wheel (the same angle) back to the right (β + ǫ 7→ β)
Clearly we ﬁnish at (exactly) the same point in M ; the complete conﬁguration p ≡ (m, e), however, changes :
p ≡ (m, e) 7→ (m, e′) ≡ p′, viz. up to the second order terms in ǫ the result is (see below)

(α, β, x, y, ϕ) 7→ (α, β, x − ǫ2R sin(ϕ + β), y + ǫ2R cos(ϕ + β), ϕ + ǫ2 R

Although this does not meet our requirements yet (rotation is present unless β = π

2 , the translation
is once more along the tie rod) there is still something interesting here which will turn out to be the essential clue
for the real solution of the parking problem. Namely, if one interprets (5.3) as a direct step from p to p′ (and not
as the eﬀective one ≡ the result of the cyclic motion described above), it is forbidden (it violates the constraints).
This particular step is even forbidden in a ’maximal way’ - it is purely vertical (projects to the same point in
M ; both p and p′ lie in the same ﬁbre). Thus the fact of vital importance is that a cycle composed exclusively
of allowed (≡ horizontal) steps can result in the (directly) forbidden motion (≡ non-vanishing vertical part).
This means that although we have come to the conclusion that (5.1) cannot be realized ’directly’ (as one step)
there is still a real hope to produce it eﬀectively - as a result of (maybe rather involved) cycle of allowed ’simple
steps’.

2 ; if β is π

The most convenient tool for studying the eﬀect of cycles is the language of vector ﬁelds (Appendix E). The
cycle i)-iv) above is just the inﬁnitesimal cycle generated by Hα, Hβ (on P ; its projection to M is generated by
∂α, ∂β and the corresponding loop closes exactly since they commute); then the resulting motion (5.3) follows
from the formula (see (E.1))

and the explicit computation of the needed commutator :

[Hα, Hβ] = R{sin(ϕ + β)∂x − cos(ϕ + β)∂y −

Since (5.3) is not enough, we can try the ’higher’ (iterated) commutators. There are two of them to be computed
and the results are :

[Hα, [Hα, Hβ]] =

(cos ϕ∂y − sin ϕ∂x)

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

[Hβ, [Hα, Hβ]] = Hα − ∂α ≡ ∂h

α − ∂α

Both of these results deserve some attention. First, note that the r.h.s of (5.6) just generates the wanted motion
(5.1) ! In more detail, the identity (see E.3)

χHβ
−ǫ ◦ χHα

ǫ2 = χ[Hα,[Hα,Hβ ]]
−ǫ4

tells us that the iterated cycle standing on the l.h.s. of (5.8) (try to draw a picture modifying appropriately
Fig.4 !) results in

(x, y, ϕ) 7→ (x + ǫ4 R2
l

sin ϕ, y − ǫ4 R2
l

cos ϕ, ϕ)

which is just the pure translation perpendicular to the tie rod. Note that this type of motion is very slow and
laborious : it is necessary to perform ten ’simple’ steps (of the order ǫ or ǫ2) to produce eﬀectively a single step
(which is of the order ǫ4) in the ’right’ direction.

The same treatment applied to (5.7) leads to the identity

Hβ

(5.10)

which shows that performing the (iterated) cycle standing on the l.h.s. of (5.10) the car moves just like if the
driver simply moved forth, but the front wheel did not rotate (no change of α at all : ideally slipping contact -
ice on the road).

As mentioned in Appendix E, the possibility of producing ’forbidden’ motions by means of the cycles composed
of ’allowed’ steps leans heavily on the fact that the curvature of the connection in question does not vanish (↔
the horizontal lifts of coordinate basis vectors do not commute). The (Lie algebra valued) curvature 2-form,
which happens [7] to be the measure of this non-commutation, can be computed easily explicitly (using the
formula E.8) here and the result reads

Ω ≡ hor dω = Ωaea = Ω0e0 + Ω1e1 + Ω2e2 =

6. Particle ﬁelds

The gauge potentials A ≡ σ∗ω (and the ﬁeld strengths F ≡ σ∗Ω) do not exhaust all the building blocks of
the gauge theory of elementary particles - there are also particle ﬁelds there : particles interact via gauge ﬁelds
(bosons).

and thus if

then

In our model of the kinematics of a car we used only the ’connection part of the theory’ yet. The question
arises whether there is an object here which is described mathematically by a particle ﬁeld and whether some
standard computation with it does make sense in this context.

If V is a vector space in which a representation ρ acts then [7] particle ﬁeld of type ρ is a V -valued function
on P which transforms according to the representation ρ with respect to the action of G on P ; in our model it
means

Here we give a simple example of such ψ. Let V = R2 and deﬁne the function ψ on P

Then ψ(p) just gives the components of the unit vector ~e ﬁxed on the car and directed along the tie rod (Fig.1).
According to Appendix A the action of E(2) has the explicit form

(α, β, x, y, ϕ) 7→ RB(α, β, x, y, ϕ) ≡

≡ (α, β, x cos Θ − y sin Θ + b1, x sin Θ + y cos Θ + b2, ϕ + Θ)

7. Conclusions and comments

9

In this paper we have presented in some detail a gauge-theoretic approach to the kinematics of a motion of
a car. It can serve as still another example of application of the ideas and techniques of the mathematics of
gauge ﬁelds and related structures within rather mundane context of the elementary (classical) mechanics (as
opposed to their standard occurrence in ’noble’ = ’fundamental’ physics).

The formal scheme is the same here like in [1] or [3] : there is a ’total’ conﬁguration space (P here ↔ the space
of located shapes in [1] ↔ X in [3]) which happens to carry the structure of the the total space of the principal
ﬁbre bundle. The group G acts there (E(2) here ↔ SO(3) in [1] ↔ SO(d) in [3]) and the space of orbits of
this action (M here ↔ the space of unlocated shapes in [1] ↔ ˜X in [3]), the base of the bundle, represents the
’directly controllable part’ of the total conﬁguration space. The connection in π : P → M provides the bridge
linking the motions in these two spaces.

The main diﬀerence lies in the physical origin of the connection in question : here (and also in [5]) it encodes
the constraints expressing the no-slipping (direct) contact of the car with the road whereas in [1],[3] and [4] it
results from the conservation laws (of the linear as well as the angular momentum) in ’nothing to push against’
situation, i.e. the constraints enter the problem dynamically.

Appendix A : The action of E(2) on E and on P

Let B ∈ SO(2), b ≡ (b1, b2) ∈ R2. Then one can deﬁne the transformation of the points χ ≡ (x1, x2) ∈ R2

by the couple (B, b) by

χ 7→ χB + b =: R(B,b)χ

(A1)

Geometrically it represents the rotation by Θ around the origin (if B =

) followed by the

translation by (b1, b2), i.e. the Euclidean transformation of χ by (B, b) ∈ E(2). The rule (A1) can be written
in purely matrix form (which is advantageous for manipulations with the gauge potentials) using the following
standard trick : let us associate the 3 × 3 matrix B and the row vector η with the couple (B, b) and the row
vector χ respectively according to

cos Θ sin Θ
− sin Θ cos Θ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

Then the matrix multiplication of η by B gives

B :=

B 0
b

1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

η := (χ, 1) ≡ (x1, x2, 1)

ηB = η′ = (χB + b, 1) ≡ (R(B,b)χ, 1)

(A2)

(A3)

i.e. the rule (A1) is reproduced from the matrix multiplication of the auxiliary quantities η and B.

The action given by (A1) or (A3) transforms the (x1, x2)-plane ’rigidly’, i.e. all distances are preserved
(RB ≡ R(B,b) is an isometry). It enables then to deﬁne the action ˆRB of E(2) on the space E of the locations
If the coordinates (x, y, ϕ) are introduced to E
of the tie rod, transforming simply both endpoints by RB.
according to the Fig.1, one obtains

(x, y, ϕ) 7→ (x cos Θ − y sin Θ + b1, x sin Θ + y cos Θ + b2, ϕ + Θ) ≡ ˆRB(x, y, ϕ)

(A.4)

Notice that the general position (x, y, ϕ) of the rod can be reached from the reference one (0, 0, 0) (the rod being
situated on the x1-axis left to the origin) by means of the unique ˆRB :

ˆRB(0, 0, 0) = (x, y, ϕ)

for B =

cos ϕ
− sin ϕ cos ϕ (cid:19)

sin ϕ

(cid:18)

, b = (x, y)

(A5)

or in coordinates

This means that the action ˆRB is transitive and free and thus E is the ’principal E(2)-space’. Note that (A5)
gives the diﬀeomorphism of E and the group E(2) itself , too.

Finally the action RB on P = M × E is given by

(m, e) 7→ (m, ˆRBe) =: RB(m, e)

(α, β, x, y, ϕ) 7→ RB(α, β, x, y, ϕ) ≡

≡ (α, β, x cos Θ − y sin Θ + b1, x sin Θ + y cos Θ + b2, ϕ + Θ)

Appendix B : The Lie algebra e(2) of the group E(2)

According to Appendix A the group E(2) can be realized by the matrices B =

, where B ∈ SO(2).

By deﬁnition, the Lie algebra e(2) consists then of all 3 × 3 matrices C such that 1 + ǫ C ≡ B(ǫ) ∈ E(2) when

the 2-nd order terms in ǫ are neglected. This leads to C =

Appendix C : A computation of the connection form ω

The form ω deﬁnes the horizontal directions (the relations between dα, dβ, dx, dy, and dϕ as a result of the
no-slipping contact of the wheels with the road) by the equations ωa = 0, a = 0, 1, 2. In particular at the
points of the section σ(M ) ⊂ P , corresponding to the ’standard’ position of a car (i.e.
for x = y = ϕ = 0;
cf.Sec.2) one has B = 1 = B−1 and

The equation ωB=1 = 0 by deﬁnition singles out the horizontal directions for x = y = ϕ = 0; it reads

On the other hand the no-slipping contact constraints for the standard position x = y = ϕ = 0 can be easily
if α 7→ α + δα (δα ≪ 1), then (x, y) ≡ (0, 0) 7→ (δαR cos β, δαR sin β) ≡ (δx, δy),
read out from the Fig.3 :
(−l, 0) 7→ (−l + δαR cos β, 0) ⇒ ϕ 7→ ϕ + δα R

l sin β; if β 7→ β + δβ (δβ ≪ 1), then (x, y, ϕ) 7→ (x, y, ϕ). Thus

A comparison with (C5) gives

Inserting this into (C1) leads ﬁnally to

Thus the diﬀerential constraints in general conﬁguration are (ωa = 0)

Note the absence of the diﬀerential dβ on the r.h.s. - it reﬂects the evident fact that turning the steering wheel
alone results in no motion of the tie rod.

Appendix D : Motion of the car with ﬁxed steering wheel

In the case of a ﬁxed steering wheel (β(t) = β0 = const) the parallel transport equations (4.1) read

y(α) = y0 + αR sin ϕ0

Thus, as expected, the front wheel draws a circle with the radius rc and the center (xc, yc).
If β0 = 0, the equations (D.1) give

which is a straight line in the direction of the tie rod.

Appendix E : Commutators, inﬁnitesimal cycles and the curvature

Let U, V be two vector ﬁelds on a manifold M, [U, V ] their commutator (Lie bracket) and χU

t and χ[U,V ]
is the map M → M sending each point x ∈ M a (parameter) distance t along the
t ). Then a computation shows that up to the second

s = χU

order terms in ǫ ≪ 1 the following important identity is valid :

(t+s) = χU

ǫ = χ[U,V ]
−ǫ2

or equivalently

χ[U,V ]
ǫ2

◦ χV

−ǫ ◦ χU

−ǫ ◦ χV

ǫ ◦ χU

ǫ = identity on M

From these formulae one deduces the standard interpretation of the commutator of two vector ﬁelds : the
inﬁnitesimal cycle generated by U and V (l.h.s. of (E.1)) does not end at the original point within the accuracy
ǫ2 (although it does within the accuracy ǫ) but rather one has to add one order smaller step along [U, V ] to

close the loop (l.h.s. of (E.2)).

Now if V is itself a commutator, V = [W, Z], the twofold use of (E.1) yields

−ǫ ◦ χW
χZ

−ǫ ◦ χZ

ǫ ◦ χW

ǫ ◦ χU

−ǫ2 ◦ χW

(E.3)

Thus the computation of ’simple’ ([U, V ]) and iterated ([U, [W, Z]]) commutators tells us what is the result of
a simple (4 steps) and iterated (4 steps, but two of them being themselves results of 4 steps, i.e. together 10
simple steps) cycles respectively (the higher iterated commutators can be treated in the same way).

All said until now is valid for any vector ﬁelds on any manifold. In the case when the vector ﬁelds in question
are horizontal lifts, the resulting commutator can be expressed in terms of the curvature of the connection.
For doing this we need ﬁrst the concept of the fundamental ﬁelds of the action RB. By deﬁnition the ﬁeld
ξC, C ≡ Caea ∈ e(2), generates the motion of any point p under the action of the one-parameter subgroup
B(λ) = eλC, i.e. for p(λ) := RB(λ)p

For the basis elements e0, e1, e2 ∈ e(2) we obtain explicitly

ξ0 ≡ ξe0 = −y∂x + x∂y + ∂ϕ

ξC(p) := ˙p(0)

ξ1 ≡ ξe1 = ∂x

ξ2 ≡ ξe2 = ∂y

and in general

ξC ≡ ξCaea = Caξea ≡ Caξa

These ﬁelds are purely vertical (directed along the ﬁber), since (by deﬁnition) the action is vertical (p and RBp
lie in the same ﬁber for all p, B). Now the relevant formula for the commutator of Hα and Hβ is

where the (e(2)-valued ) curvature 2-form Ω = Ωaea is given by

[Hα, Hβ] = ξ−Ω(Hα,Hβ ) = −Ωa(Hα, Hβ)ξa

Ωa = dωa +

bc ωb ∧ ωc
ca

bc being the structure constants; they are computed in Appendix B). The formula (E.7) shows that

(ca
i) [Hα, Hβ] is non-zero if and only if Ω is non-zero
ii) [Hα, Hβ] is purely vertical ⇒ the corresponding cycle generates ’forbidden’ motion.
The explicit form of Ω in our case is displayed in Sec.5 (see (5.11) , (5.12)).

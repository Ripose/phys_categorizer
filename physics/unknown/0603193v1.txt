In heavy traffic with congested roadway the maximum traffic flow (road capacity) also 

depends on length of cars (minimum clearances). This is deduced in a simple deriva-

tion suited for classroom demonstration as well as homework. The resulting equation 

demonstrates a new relation to an apparently unrelated area of physics, the maximum 

ship velocity (hull speed) and explains why traffic is sometimes faster on the slow 

(right) lane on a congested multi-lane road. 

Capacity of a road is determined by car velocity and distance between cars, besides 

other influences. Maximum capacity occurs at a specific speed, it usually is attained by 

self-regulating on a congested road. This equilibrium velocity can be derived using 

simplifying assumptions by derivation of an equation. 

In a congested roadway capacity q of the road is determined by velocity v and following 

distance s of cars; v and s depend on each other. Following distance s of cars is a fixed 
fraction of the way to stop the car, typically 50% to 100 % 1 2. For sake of simplicity this 

fraction is set here to 1 (100%) without affecting essentials of results. Then s becomes 

sum of breaking distance and distance driven during reaction time th,

It is assumed that maximum break acceleration is gravity g (friction coefficient (cid:181) times 
gravity, (cid:181) having a maximum of 1, stronger breaking would lock wheels3 4). Calculation 

of the fraction of road length consumed by the car L/N requires to add the cars length l

This neglects influences of slope and curvature of roads which practically often limit

This function q demonstrates following dependencies: 

a) At v and l constant q continuously decreases with t h 

b) At v and t h constant q continuously decreases with l  

c) At t h and l constant q has a maximum at vmax resulting in a qmax   

For example: 

At l=5m and t h = 1s vmax is 10 m/s = 36 km/h = 22mi/h and maximum traffic flow qmax is 
1700 cars/h/lane in agreement with observations 1 2 5.  
qmax occurring at vmax is usually attained by self-regulating on a congested road 2 3 4. 

qmax is determined by the derivative of function q (v):

Examples: car l = 5m vmax = 10 m/s = 36 km/h, Truck  l =15 m vmax = 17 m/s = 60 km/h 

In traffic on a congested road, the slow (right) lane usually has trucks with longer l re-

sulting in faster equilibrium speeds first, which will eventually even out by drivers 

choosing to change lanes. 

Result (1) most curiously demonstrates a new relation to an apparently unrelated area 

of physics, the maximum ship velocity vmahu (hull speed) of a ship displacing water and 

floating in deep water (deeper than ship length l) which is due to water wave Dispersion 

and resonance

This new relation to an apparently unrelated area of physics might show students phys-

ics can be of great simplicity.

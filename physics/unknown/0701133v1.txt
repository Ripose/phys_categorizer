We have developed the baseline design for the  straw  drift  tube  tracking detectors for high 
rate  environment  application.  The  low-mass  inner  straw  elements  and  the  technology  of  the 
multianode straws assembly was devised and checked. The prototype chamber was constructed and 
studied the granularity of similar chambers can be reduced to one cm2. 

 

1.Introduction 

 
  
Drift  chambers  on  the  basis  of  thin-walled  drift  tubes  (straw)  are  widely  used  as  track 
detectors especially in the high rate environment [1,2,3,4].  The transition radiation tracker of the 
ATLAS Inner Detector [2] is good example of the above applying the straw with the diameter of 
4mm  and  length  of  ~40cm  and  150cm  for  End-Cap  and  Barrel  detectors,  correspondingly.  The 
tracker of the spectrometer COMPASS uses the straw with the diameter of ~9.6mm for periphery of 
the chambers and 6mm diameter - for the central area, the sensitive length of the straw is to 325cm. 
Granularity of the central area of the COMPASS chambers is equal to ~192cm2 and ~76cm2 for the 
small  part  of  the  area  near  the  beam  hole  in  them.  Each  straw  is  read  out  from  one  end  and  the 

8 
occupancy in each tube below 2% at maximum beam rates for the intensities about 2·10

muons and 

7 
hadrons per 5.1 s spill for muon and hadron beams, respectively. The expected rate for 
up to 4·10
the  Barrel  TRT  straws  is  about  17  MHz  at  the  luminosity  L=1034cm-2c-1.  To  reduce  the  straw 
occupancy by 2 times, the Barrel straws consist of two electrically isolated anode parts [2, 5]. The 
read-out is performed independently from each part of the anode from two ends for each straw. 

In the set-up CBM GSI under construction the expected rate is about 140 kHz/cm2 for Au-
Au  collisions  at  25AGeV  with  the  reaction  rate  of  10MHz  [6].    To  provide  a  small  value  of  the 
occupancy for the track detectors of large area, their granularity should be several cm2. Using the 
straw chambers with the anode readout will result in strong growing of this value in case of long 
straws. For the case when the detector is set of small modules with the short straws there will be not 
only a low ratio of the sensitive area to the overall detector dimensions but also an increase of its 
average radiation thickness because of the external module frames. 

It has been earlier shown a principle opportunity of constructing straw with three electrically 
isolated parts of its anode and readout for the both straw ends from its end-plugs, and for the central 
anode  segment  -  through  the  straw  wall  [5].  Construction  of  the  big  length  straw  with  a  multi 
segmented anode providing independent readout from the electrically independent segments, allows 
one to obtain the necessary occupancy over all the area of the large-size detector by optimizing the 
segmented lengths.  

The  development  of  the  low-mass  readout  links  for  the  inner  anode  segments,  using  new 
technologies, should result in preserving a minimal value of the straw detector radiation thickness in 

comparison with well-known coordinate detectors.  Highly granulated coordinate straw detectors of 
large area having small radiation thickness and high radiation hardness, should be interesting for the 
CBM GSI,   upgraded of the LHC detectors and construction of detectors for ILC. 

Below  there  are  some  results  of  the  first  prototype  made  at  JINR  with  multi  segmented 

anodes for the straws 4mm in diameter.  

 
2. Concept of the straw with a multisegmented anode  
 
To construct two segmented anodes, a stand has been developed at JINR as well as methods 
  
of their manufacturing [7]. Two anode wires separated from each other by an isolated gap, are fused 
into a glass capillary tube 6 or 7mm length, 0.25mm in outer diameter and 0.1mm of inner diameter 
(Fig.1). The mass of the boronsilikate capillary tube is 0.094mg per 1mm of its length.

(5) are the gilded tungsten wires in 30µm of diameter

The bottom part of figure shows an opportunity to fuse the additional wire and anode wire together 
in the capillary tube, for the galvanic contact to this segment for the readout. 

A  concept  of  manufacturing  straws  having  a  segmented  anode  is  demonstrated  with  an 
example  of  the  straw  with  three  anode  segments  (Fig.2).  A  multi  segmented  anode  assembled 
beforehand, is put into the straw and fixed at the ends. The readout from the end anode segments is 
carried out from the straw end plugs. The information from the middle segment is read out over the 
contact wire going through the spacer supporting the capillary tube and the hole in the straw wall.  
To compare the signals going through the straw wall and its end plugs, the right anode segment is 
equipped with two readout outputs 3 and 4.

Fig.2 Straw 4mm in diameter contains three anode segments. From the left and middle segments the readout are from 
the output 1 and 2, correspondingly.  From the right segment the readout can be performed either from the output 3 or 4.  

 
 When  assembling  the  segmented  anodes  some  capillary  tubes  are  combined  with  the 
specialized  polycarbonate  spacers,  forming  "assembly  units"  (Fig.3),  without  preventing  the 
passage of the gas mixture along the straw. The anodes are installed into the straws under tension of 
70g,  the  contact  wires  cross  some  holes  in  the  spacers  and  are  taken  out  through  windows  of  the 
sizes  ~2x2mm  in  the  corresponding  places  of  the  straw  walls.  After  testing  over  all  the  readout 
channels, each window of the straws is gas tightly closed. High voltage can be applied to the straw 
anodes as well as onto the cathodes in dependence on the readout scheme from the straws.

Several analogous straws shown in Fig. 2, have been assembled and tested. Three anode segments 
of these straws had a length of ~ 185, 100 and 180mm. The straw under testing was blown through 
with gas mixture ArCO2 (70/30) and irradiated by the 55Fe source through the slit collimator placed 
perpendicularly to the straw anode. The width of the gamma quaint beam in the median straw plane 
was  ~  1mm.  High  voltage  was  given  to  the  corresponding  anode  segment.  The  current  amplifier 
with the input resistance of 300Ω and the sensitivity threshold of 750eV was connected directly to 
the segment output through the capacitor of 200pf. The test of straw durability to gas has shown the 
absence of gas leakages.  Fig.4 demonstrates the general layout of straw.

 Fig.5 shows values of the amplitudes being registered from the corresponding signal segments. The 
collimator was moved along the straw, for the right segment the signal amplitudes were measured in 
each  position  of  the  collimator  from  the  3  and  4  outputs  by  turns.  The  voltage  precision  on  the 
anode was better than 1V, the amplitude was measured with one and the same amplifier placed near 
the outputs 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Fig.2).

                                   Fig.6. Straw inefficiency on its length in the spacer unit length. 
 
A small slope of the dependence can be explained by the direction of the gas mixture flow. 

An  average  deviation  of  the  signal  amplitudes  D  defined  with  the  expression  D=2(Amax  - 
Amin)/(Ain  +  Aout),  is  not  more  than  3%.  Values  Amax,  Amin  -  maximal  and  minimal  signal 
amplitudes for the straw, and Ain and Aout are the signal amplitudes at the beginning and end of 
the straw along the direction of the gas mixture flow. Scanning of the spacer units length by using 
the collimated source, has shown that inefficient straw length is 7.2mm when using a capillary tube 
7mm  long  and  a  spacer  4.15mm  long  and  3.95mm  in  diameter.  The  radiation  thickness  of  these 
straw lengths is not more than 0.4%Xo for each. Fig.6 demonstrates inefficiency in the spacer unit 
area. 
            Checking  of  the  individual    straws  with  3  anode  sectors  have  shown  their  good  operation 
using  the  gas  mixture  of  ArCO2  in  the  range  of  the  gas    gain  till  105,  and  no  discharges  were 
observed between any elements placed under the anode-cathode potentials. 
 

3. Detector prototype 
 
 
       To  check  a  real  opportunity  of  manufacturing  the  straw  detectors  with  a  big  number  of  the 
anode  segments,  the  prototype  was  made  from  19straws  50cm  long  and  4mm  in  diameter.   The 
prototype  consists  of  2  straw  layers  and  neighbouring  straws  of  the  layer  were  glued  between 
themselves. Fig.7. shows the common view of the prototype.

Four segmented anodes were installed into 10straws of the top layer (Fig.7), from the nine straws of 
the second layer the five straws had usual one-segmented anodes and four straws contained three 
segmented anodes. The prototype with the 19 straws had totally 57 readout channels. Fig.8 shows 
the electrical scheme of the upper layer straws. The voltage onto the edge anode sectors of the both 
layers straws is given from the H/V bus via resistors 1MΩ to the crimping in the end-plugs anode 
wires,  signals  through  the  capacitors  are  transferred  to  the  connectors  1  and  4  placed  nearby. 
Signals from the middle segments are given to the connections 2 and 3 by using the contact wires of 
about  15cm  long.   Resistance  of  the  contact  points  between  the  anode  and  contact  wires  do  not 
influence the registered signals due to their small values (Fig.9).

Tests over the prototype over all the registration channels have shown good signal identity at 
identical parameters of high voltage, environment temperature and partial pressure of the gas                      
mixture (Fig.10).

         4. Conclusions 
 
         The fulfilled studies have shown an opportunity of assembling multi segmented anodes, their 
installation into the straw with the followed output of the contact wires through the straw walls, the 
preliminary  check  of  the  readout  channels  with  the  necessary  changing  of  the  working  wrong 
anodes and next gas tight closing the straws. The results are very promising and the study is needed 
to be continued.

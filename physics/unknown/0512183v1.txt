Abstract 
       We  describe  here  the  “Atomic  bremsstrahlung”  (AB)  –  emission  of  continuous  spectrum 
electromagnetic  radiation,  which  is  generated  in  collisions  of  particles  that  have  internal 
deformable  structure  that  includes  positively  and  negatively  charged  constituents.    The 
deformation of one of or both colliding partners induces multiple, mainly dipole, time-dependent 
electrical  moments  that  become  a  source  of  radiation.  The  history  of  AB  invention  is  presented 
and  it’s  unusual  in  comparison  to  ordinary  bremsstrahlung  (OB)  properties  are  discussed.  As 
examples, fast electron – atom, non-relativistic and relativistic collisions are considered. Attention 
is  given  to  ion  –  atom  and  atom  –  atom  collisions.  Specifics  of  “elastic”  and  “inelastic”  (i.e. 
radiation accompanied by destruction of collision partners) AB will be mentioned. Attention will 
be  given  to  possible  manifestation  of  AB  in  Nature  and  in  some  exotic  systems,  for  instance 
scattering of electrons upon muonic hydrogen. Some cooperative effects connected to AB will be 
considered. New classical schemes similar to AB will be presented.      
        
 
1. Introduction 
 
       According 
to  Electrodynamics,  both  classical  and  quantum,  continuous  spectrum 
pm moves  in  a 
electromagnetic  radiation  is  generated  when  a  particle  with  charge 
static external field (Akhiezer and Berestetsky, 1965; Heitler, 1954). A tiny atom or a molecule, a 
solid body or a macroscopic magnet, a star or a galaxy can form this static field. In all these cases 
the radiation created is called Bremsstrahlung (BrS). It is emitted by a charged projectile particle 
that  looses  its  kinetic  energy  (perhaps,  potential  also)  under  the  action  of  the  static  field  of  the 
target.  
       The properties of this BrS are well investigated, presented and discussed at length in almost 
all books on Electrodynamics (see e.g. Berestetskii, Lifshits, and Pitaevskii, 1974). Thus, it is well 
pm . These features, 
known that BrS intensity is proportional to 
particularly  the  latter  one,  very  often  serve  even  as  a  definition  of  BrS  as  radiation,  whose 
pm (see  e.g.  Landau  and  Lifshits,  1988).  There  are  tables  of 
intensity  depends  upon 
calculated  values  of  BrS  intensities  generated  in  electron-atom  collisions  (see  e.g.  Pratt  et  al., 
1977, 1981). This type of radiation we will call here Ordinary Bremsstrahlung, or OB. 
       However, it was suggested already almost forty years ago that there exist another mechanism 
of generating of the continuous spectrum electromagnetic radiation. For example, Amusia (1965) 
assumed that in collisions of two atoms giant common resonances can be excited that can decay 
by emitting not only one or several electrons but a single continuous spectrum photon as well. It 
was  demonstrated  by  Buimistrov  (1974)  that  in  electron  –  atom  collision  continuous  spectrum

radiation could be emitted not only by the incoming electron, but also by a target hydrogen atom, 
dipolar polarized by the incoming electron (Buimistrov and Trakhtenberg, 1975). The universality 
of  this  mechanism  that  was  called  Atomic  Bremsstrahlung  (AB)  or  Polarization  Radiation  (PR) 
was  demonstrated  and  emphasized  in  (Amusia  et  al.,  1976).  This  mechanism  was  employed  in 
discussing gas discharge phenomenon by Zon (1977) and resonance photoemission from solids by 
Wendin and Nuroch (1977)  
       As  a  retrospective,  it  is  hard  for  me  to  refrain  from  recollecting  that  the  publication  of  our 
paper  (Amusia  et  al.,  1976)  was  delayed  due  to  referee’s  (a  rather  well  known  physicist) 
“impossible!” comment for about one and a half years. Indeed, as any noticeable innovation, PR 
went through all usual stages, from almost “impossible” at the beginning to almost “self-evident” 
thirty years later. The name “”Atomic” Bremsstrahlung” was introduced in  (Amusia, 1982) as a 
response  to  Pratt’s  paper  (Pratt,  1981)  in  Comments  on  Atomic  and  Molecular  Physics  called 
“Electron  Bremsstrahlung”,  where  the  dynamic  response  of  the  target  atom  electrons  in  the 
process  of  emission of radiation was neglected  completely. The name  AB met a lot of criticism 
from those who emphasized that it is not a sort of Bremsstrahlung but a new mechanism of photon 
emission. This point of view led to the name “Polarization radiation” or PR that will be used in 
this paper along with AB.    
      PR was also independently and even a little bit earlier discovered in investigating collisions of 
almost  entirely  classical  objects,  namely  ions  in  plasma.  It  was  demonstrated  by  Gailitis  and 
Tzitovich (1974) that the main source of electromagnetic radiation in plasma are unbound semi-
classical  objects  “ion  +  neutralizing  electrons”,  which  become  polarized  in  collision  processes. 
Time-dependent  dipole  moment  is  induced  in  them  that  become  a  source  of  electromagnetic 
radiation. Qualitatively, Fig.1 illustrates the classical picture of AB (PR) radiation.

       It  depicts  a  ''classical  atom''  polarized  by  the  incoming  charge.  In  this  ''classical''  atom  the 
positive charge of an ion is surrounded by a number of ''classical'' electrons. Under the action of 
the projectile (that is assumed for definiteness to have the same charge as an electron) all target 
electrons are “pushed out'' as is seen in the Figure. So, a dipole (and other multipole) moment are 
induced. The dipole moment is directed along the axis, on which the ''nucleus'' and the projectile 
are located. Due to projectile motion, the induced dipole as well as higher multipole moments are 
rotating  in  space  and  changing  their  absolute  value.  As  a  result,  electromagnetic  radiation  is 
generated.   
       Instead of a charge without internal structure, the projectile can be also a ''classical'' atom or 
an ion.  In this case both, the target and the projectile can emit radiation. Those pictures present 
mechanisms  essential  in  plasmas.  Fig.  2  depicts  another  ''classical''  situation:  a  ''classical''  atom 
moves in an external, for definiteness, electrical, static field. Acting differently upon electrons and 
the nucleus, the external field induces dipole moment in the incoming atom.

Fig. 2. Classical “atom” in an external field 
        
       As is shown in the Fig. 2, the induced dipole moment changes its orientation (rotates in space) 
and  alters  its  magnitude,  thus  leading  to  photon  emission.  This  mechanism  could  be  of  interest 
also in connection to radiation of not totally stripped ions in storage rings or ion accelerators. In 
these cases the deformation of electron distribution of the ions under the action of the accelerator's 
static  field  induces  a  dipole  moment.  The  latter,  changing  in  time  its  direction  and  magnitude, 
becomes a source of radiation.  
       In  the  cases  presented  by  Fig.  1  and  Fig.  2  the  photon  energy  is  taken  from  the  projectile's 
kinetic energy, but the photon is emitted by the dipole moment induced in either the target (Fig. 1) 
or  in  the  projectile,  as  in  the  case  of  Fig.  2  or  when  an  atom  instead  of  a  simple  charge  is  a 
projectile in “atom-atom” collision in Fig. 1  
       This article is devoted to consideration of PR (or AB) process, applied not to ''classical'' but to 
real atoms and ions and thus described by quantum instead of classical mechanics. However, the 
classical pictures present qualitatively accurate description of the AB process. 
       As  to  the  atomic  collisions,  it  was  important  to  demonstrate  not  only  the  very  fact  of  AB 
existence, but also the possibility that AB at least at some frequencies ω of the emitted photons 
could be considerable or even dominate over OB. The opposite view was supported by the widely 
known  so-called  low  energy  theorem  formulated  by  Low  (1958),  according  to  which  the  BrS 
0→ω 1 can be presented as 
intensity I at emitted photon energy

However,  for 
intensity  of  AB,  IAB,  is  bigger  than  the  intensity  of  OB,  IOB,  as  it  was  demonstrated  in  by 
Buimistrov and Trakhtenberg (1975) and by Amusia et al. (1976). In fact, detailed investigations 
demonstrated that IAB could considerably overcome IOB. 
      Since the seventieth and then during eighties it appeared a lot of theoretical publications, the 
results  of  which  were  summarized  in  review  articles  and  books    [e.g.  (Amusia,  1986,  1990), 
(Amusia et al., 1992), (Korol’ and Solov’yov., 1997), (Korol et al., 2004)]. A number of specific 
features  of AB,  for example its complete independence of projectile mass were predicted.  So,  it 
seemed that the direct observation of AB is a simple matter. This proved to be not the case. During 
all  this  rather  long  period  only  one  experiment  directly  and  unambiguously  confirming  the 
existence  of  AB  was  performed  by  studying  the  radiation  emission  spectrum  in  collisions  of 
medium-energy  electrons  with  Xe  gas  target  (Verkhovtseva  et  al.,  1983).  C.  Quarles  after  a 
number of years of research, found noticeable contribution of PR to the total intensity of radiation 
by fast electrons going through gas targets (Portillo and Quarles, 2004).  
       From the very formulation of the AB mechanism its universal nature became evident. In other 
words, it became clear that AB leads to emission of radiation not only in electron – atom or ion – 
atom  collisions,  but  in  any  case  when  at  least  one  of  the  colliding  particles,  even  being  neutral, 
consists of electrical charges of different sign. As a result, time-dependent multiple moments are 
induced  leading  to  emission  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  Of  course,  AB  acts  in  molecular 
collisions  and  in  collisions  of  macroscopic  bodies  that  consist  of  atoms  or  ions  and  electrons. 
However,  this  mechanism  acts  also  when  microscopic  projectiles  like  neutron  or  neutrino 
participate in a collision process.  AB acts in their collisions with atom or nuclei. Moreover, since 
a  neutron  consists  of  at  least  three  quarks,  it  can  be  also  deformed  in  a  collision  with  another 
neutron, thus generating emission of electromagnetic radiation. More general, mechanisms similar 
to AB lead to creation of other particles, like e.g. neutral π- mesons, in nucleonic collisions.     
         
       2. Radiation in electron – atom scattering 
       In this Section we will investigate quantum-mechanically the most transparent and illustrative 
example  of  collisions,  in  which  Atomic  Bremsstrahlung  is  generated,  namely  the  electron-atom 
 can be presented as a sum of two contributions, having 
collisions. The total BrS amplitude

looses  its  dependence  upon  p,  leading  to  a  very  simple  and  transparent  expression  for  the  BrS 
amplitude 2/ (see Amusia, 1990)

       This result has a simple qualitative explanation. Since for 
one can neglect the electron-
nucleus binding, the atomic and the incoming electrons, as a system of free electrons cannot have 
a time-dependent dipole moment and therefore cannot radiate. What is left over is the radiation of 
the  incoming  electron  in  the  Coulomb  field  of  the  nucleus  (5).  Amusia,  Avdonina  et  al.  (1985) 
 
called “atomic striptease” the elimination of electron’s contribution to BrS at 
this effect was demonstrated for the first time by Buimistrov and Trakhtenberg (1977).  
       In  all  textbooks  BrS  of  an  electron  on  an  atom  is  described  as  OB  of  an  electron  in 
decelerating  in  the  screened  static  field  of  atom  (see  e.g.  Heitler,  1954).  The  inclusion  of  AB 
changes  this  result  not  only  quantitatively,  but  qualitatively,  since  the  ratio  of  OB  to  total  BrS 
amplitudes is given for a neutral atom by the following expression:

It is seen that if 
       For neutral atoms to generate OB the projectile must come inside the target atom, while AB is 
generated  by  dipole,  i.e.  long-range  interaction.  Since  AB  and  OB  are  created  at  long  and  short 
distances,  respectively,  their  contributions  to  the  total  BrS  add  to  each  other  almost  without

       In  the  relativistic  case  the  angular  distribution  of  OB  and  AB  are  qualitatively  different. 
Namely, the OB radiation is concentrated within a cone relative to the direction of the incoming 
. As to the AB radiation, its angular distribution

is similar to that of non-relativistic case, since the rotation of the dipole induced in the target atom 
by the projectile proceeds with non-relativistic velocities. This is a consequence of relatively weak 
projectile – target Coulomb interaction that is unable to “bind” the induced dipole to the projectile 
strong enough in order to force it to rotate relativistic. 
       
       4. Polarization Radiation in ion-atom collisions 
       Let  us  start  by  considering  the  case  when  radiation  is  generated  in  collisions  of  a  heavy 
charge,  e.g.  by  a  proton  instead  of  electron,  with  an  atom.  The  BrS  amplitude  in  this  case  is

 the AB 
       It is essential that while OB for heavy particles is suppressed by a factor 
contribution  is  the  same.  As  a  result,  e.g.  for  a  proton,  BrS  is  determined  entirely  by  the  AB 
I≥ω   AB  in  electron  –  atom  collisions  is  bigger  than  OB,  due  to  the 
mechanism.  Since  for 
polarization mechanism the BrS of a charge at such ω is almost independent on its mass.  
       Of course, we have assumed that in BrS process the target atom remains unaltered in the sense 
that its initial and final states remain the same. In fact, an electron or heavy charge scattering with 
an atom can be accompanied not only by radiation but also by target ionization and excitation. The 
ionized electrons can in their turn radiate, leading to so-called inelastic BrS, that differs from the 
considered  above  elastic  BrS,  in  which  the  only  result  of  projectile  –  target  scattering  is  the 
emission of a photon. It is understandable however that in the inelastic BrS each atomic electron 
pN  appears only as a 
contributes individually, so the number of essentially participating electrons 
pN   already  in  the 
. So, generally speaking, the ratio of elastic-to-inelastic AB spectrum is 

factor  in  the  inelastic  cross-section.  As  to  elastic  AB,  it  includes  the  factor 

  However,  at  low  frequencies  the  inelastic  BrS  spectrum

Low theorem 
       Of  special  interest  is  the  inelastic  process,  in  which  the  incoming  particle  collides  with  an 
excited target and the emitted in the process photon carries away the excitation energy leaving the 
target  in  its  ground  state.  The  cross-section  of  such  a  process  that  can  be  considered  as

Superelastic  (Landau  and  Lifshits,  1988)  is  non-zero,  in  fact  even  divergent  as 
projectile energy 
       Of special interest is the emission of radiation in the collision of two particles, both of which 
has  internal  structure,  e.g.  two  atoms.  Such  a  collision  is  a  rather  complicated  process  even 
without  photon  emission  since  it  is  accompanied  by  excitation  or  emission  of  one  or  several 
electrons.  Here  we  will  concentrate  on  photon  emission  process  that  proceeds  without  inelastic 
processes, such as excitation or ionization of the collision partners.  
       With some inessential for qualitative consideration restrictions the amplitude of BrS in atom – 
atom collisions can be presented (see in Amusia, 1990) in the following form

Here  Z1(2),  M1(2),  N1(2),  Q(1(2))  (q), 
are  the  nuclear  charge,  mass,  number  of  electrons, 
atomic form-factor and generalized polarizability of atoms 1 and 2, respectively. The expression 
(19) is a natural generalization of (2), with (4) taken into account. The upper line in (19) stands for 
OB while the second line represents the AB, namely the radiation of the first atom polarized by 
the distributed charge (
 of the second atom and the radiation of the latter polarized by 
the distributed charge  (
 
of the first atom. It is seen that for neutral atoms 
)2(1
the  total  radiation  is  AB.  The  formula  (18)  is  correct  at  high  collision  velocities  only.  With 
decrease  of  velocity  the  corresponding  qualitative  picture  of  AB  remains  valid,  however  the 
radiation intensity cannot be expressed via polarizability of the collision partners. Instead, a sort of 
a common polarizability has to enter the BrS amplitude expression.   
       According to (19), for identical colliding particles, “1”=”2”, the BrS amplitude is zero. This 
fact  has  a  simple  qualitative  explanation:  identical  charge  distributions  cannot  form  a  time-
dependent  dipole  moment  and  therefore  cannot  emit  dipole  radiation.  However,  in  collisions  of 
identical particles quadrupole radiation can be emitted. Its intensity for reasonably small ω is by a 
factor 
  smaller  than  the  normal  dipole  radiation.  It  will  be  demonstrated  in  Section 
10a that this fact plays a very important role in radiative cooling of volumes of gas. 
       The angular distribution of BrS generated in heavy particles collisions is, as it follows from its 
AB physical nature, the same as that of a rotating dipole, being proportional to 
, where 
θ is the angle between the projectile and emitted photon momenta. 
 
       5. Relativistic ion-atom collisions  
       Relativistic  ion-atom  or  atom-atom  collisions  are  much  more  complex  for  theoretical 
treatment than the non-relativistic ones. We will see, however, that it is worthwhile to overcome 
the  corresponding  difficulties,  since  the  emitted  in  collisions  radiation  has  a  number  of 
peculiarities  and  interesting  features.  The  complications  in  the  relativistic  collision  of  heavy 
particles have the same origin as in the case of electron – atom collision. These are consequences 
of relativistic expression for energy-momentum relation for each particle and of retardation in the 
interaction between moving charges. The interaction between a moving charge and a photon has 
to be also properly modified (see Berestetskii et al., 1974).  
       Qualitatively,  the  spectra  of  photons  emitted  in  collisions  of  fast  but  non-relativistic  and 
relativistic  structured  heavy  particles,  like  ions  or  atoms,  are  essentially  different  because  of 
Doppler effect and aberration that modify the frequency and the emission angle of a photon that 
originates from the object that moves relativistic.

       The  analytic  expressions  for  the  amplitude  became  considerably  more  complex  than  (19). 
Amusia et al. (1988) investigated the problem initially. It is more convenient to present it as a sum 
of  two  terms  representing  the  photon  emission  by  the  projectile,

respectively:

seen that even relatively small frequencies in the projectile frame can be increased by a factor up 
to γ. 
       The relative contribution of projectile and target radiation depends upon the collision velocity. 
Indeed, as is seen from (21), if the following inequality is fulfilled

then  the  projectile  radiation  dominates.  If  an  opposite  inequality  holds,  the  target  becomes  the 
main source of radiation.  
        As is seen from (21), the angular distribution of the target radiation is like that of a rotating 
dipole.  The  angular  distribution  for  the  projectile  radiation  in  relativistic  atom-atom  collisions 
depends upon ω. Being in general rather complex, it is simplified in two limiting cases of very

projectile  generates  radiation  just  as  a  charge.  This  is  understandable,  since  for 
projectile electrons can be treated as free charges radiating coherently in the field of the target. 
       According to (19), two identical particles do not radiate. The situation in relativistic collisions 
is essentially different: the radiation intensity is  non-zero, as it follows from (21). Qualitatively, 
the  complete  compensation  of  dipole  moments  induced  in  the  projectile  and  target  disappears 
because  in  e.g.  the  target  frame  the  projectile’s  induced  moment  is  shifted  in  size  and  direction 
relative to that of the target due to Doppler effect and angular aberration.  
Corresponding  expressions  can  be  obtained  from  (21).  We  will  present  them  for  the  case

       It was demonstrated in the previous sections that AB is totally determined by the generalized 
of  the  colliding  objects.  The  bigger  are  the  polarizabilities,  the  more 
polarizabilities 
important is the AB contribution. Relatively recently multiatomic objects were created that have 
extremely  big  polarizabilities  in  quite  broad  frequency  regions,  namely  metallic  clusters  and 
60C .  The  polarizability  of  metallic 
fullerenes,  the  most  well  known  of  which  is  the  molecule 
clusters can reach tens of thousands of atomic units, as compared to the atomic value of about unit 
60C   is  by  two  orders  of  magnitude  bigger

means a tremendous enhancement, having in mind that AB in the 
Xe is quite prominent and was observed clearly by Verkhovtseva et al. in 1983.  
       Presented  above  consideration  of  BrS  in  electron-cluster  or  electron-fullerene  collisions  is 
satisfactory for estimations only. Having in mind that polarizability of these targets is very big, the 
action upon the incoming and outgoing electrons of corresponding polarization potential may be 
essential.  Big  polarizability  can  affect  the  transverse  photon  propagation  leading  to  essential 
.  It  is 
contribution  of  these  photons  to  projectile  –  target  electron  interaction  even  at 
essential  to  note  that  in  electron  –  fullerenes  collisions  the  non-dipole  radiation  becomes 
considerably more important than in the atomic case, since the radiating objects are much bigger 
than atoms.

       Of  special  interest  is  the  BrS  of  clusters,  in  which  electrons  of  individual  atoms  are  not 
collectivized,  as  in  metallic  clusters  or  fullerenes.  We  believe,  that  in  this  case  AB  is  also 
enhanced, as compared to isolated atoms. Indeed, AB is generated at big distances, of the order of

60C   was  selected  as  the  best  known. 
       There  exists  a  whole  variety  of  fullerenes,  of  which 
Other fullerenes could be also a source of radiation. If fullerenes or clusters have a non-spherical 
form,  they  can  have  not  one,  but  two  Giant  resonances  and  AB  would  be  represented  by  two 
maxima, correspondingly.   
 
       7. Inelastic Polarization Radiation 
       An important specific feature of collisions with atoms and atom-like objects is their ability to 
be ionized or disintegrated, which leads to emission of secondary electrons. Moving in the field of 
residual  ions,  these  electrons  emit  OB.  So,  entirely,  the  total  radiation  created  in  the  considered 
collisions  is  a  sum  of  normal  OB,  AB  and  radiation  of  secondary  electrons  that  consist  of  what 
could be called secondary or inelastic OB and AB or OBin and ABin.  
       To  calculate  such  a  spectrum  is  a  challenge  indeed.  Amusia  et  al.,  1987  investigated  this 
problem for the first time. For high ω and 
 the inelastic BrS dominates parametrically 
/1≤
over inelastic one. Indeed, the summation over contribution of atomic electrons in elastic BrS is 
eN  being the 
performed in the amplitude, which is manifested in the fact that 
number of actively participating in AB electrons, enters the amplitude (2). As a result the elastic

, while AB contribution is much smaller, being of the order of  ω~
. 

This contribution is by a factor of N smaller than the first term in (8) that represent the elastic OB 
contribution.       
       The  situation  for  low  ω  becomes  considerably  different.  Elastic  and  inelastic  OB  are  both 
ω/1~
       Inelastic BrS could be of great importance in cluster-cluster or fullerenes-fullerene collisions, 
since these are objects that can be easily ionized or even entirely disintegrated. However since the 
number  of  collectivized  electrons  N  is  very  big  for  these  objects,  the  elastic  AB  dominates 
strongly over all the inelastic BrS.  
       Entirely,  it  was  demonstrated  that  elastic  AB  dominates  over  OB,  OBin  and  ABin  in  the 
following  ω  region, 
.  This  fact  is  essential  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  AB 
experimental detection: in this ω region all the BrS spectrum comes from the elastic AB.  
       Of interest is a specific example of inelastic BrS, in which the incoming electron collides with 
an exited atom. Corresponding BrS that is accompanied by the target’s de-excitation can be called 
super  elastic  BrS.  If  the  projectile  is  relativistic,  one  has  to  take  into  account  exchange  of  real 
instead of only virtual photons between the excited target and incoming particle. As a result, this

process becomes resonant and its amplitude can be presented as a product of photon emission by 
the excited target and Compton scattering on the projectile (Batkin and Almaliev, 1985).

collisions  one  can  use  (18)  putting  there 
Radiation in neutron - atom collisions requires, however, special consideration, which was carried 
out for the first time by Amusia et al., 1987 (see also Amusia et al., 1992). Let us at first neglect 
the only direct neutron-electron interaction, namely the magnetic one. Then the incoming neutron 
interacts  only  with  the  nucleus.  As  a  result  of  this  interaction  the  nucleus  is  experiencing  recoil 
and  became  shifted  off  its  previous  position  right  in  the  atomic  center.  This  shift  being  time-
dependent  induces  an  alternative  dipole  moment  in  the  surrounding  electron  shells  and  thus 
generates AB. The corresponding differential in ω cross section is given by

  for  a  given  nucleus  can  have 
narrow  powerful  so-called  Feshbach  resonances.  But  by  the  order  of  magnitude  in  the  non-
resonant area 
       It is reflected in (30) that the neutron-atom AB amplitude has two scales, namely the nuclear 
one  that  represents  the  neutron-nucleus  scattering  at  about 
  and  the  atomic  at 
cm810−
.  Obviously,  the  neutron  radiation  cross  section  is  much  smaller  than  that  of  a  proton, 
where AB is of the same order as in the electron-atom scattering. This smallness is seen from (30),

This  potential  describes  the  interaction  of  neutron’s  magnetic  moment  with  the  electric  E  and 
magnetic H atomic fields, respectively. The first term in (31) describes the Schwinger’s neutron 
scattering in the electric field of an atom, while the second represents the neutron scattering in the 
magnetic  field,  created  mainly  by  the  orbital  moments  of  atomic  electrons.  OB  of  neutron’s 
magnetic moment is negligible as compared to respective AB, since 
       Particularly  simple  is  the  neutron’s  magnetic  moment  contribution  for  very  slow  neutrons,

       9. Nucleon-nucleus collisions        
       When a nucleon collides with a nucleus, the latter becomes deformed and emits polarization 
radiation  (or  AB)  with  ω  of  the  order  of  nucleon  binding  energies  in  nucleus.  The  radiation  is 
strongly enhanced in the region of nuclear Giant resonance energies (see e.g. Amusia et al., 1992) 
similar to what happens in atomic collisions. The essential difference is however in the fact that 
the quadrupole radiation in nuclei are much more pronounced than in atoms.

protons and neutrons in a nucleus, 
existence of the effective charge in nucleus is a consequence of the fact that e.g. dipole excitation 
is only the movement of protons relative to neutrons while the movement of the nucleus center of 
gravity is recoil, not an excitation (see e.g. Bohr and Mottelson, 1973).    
       For  an  incoming  neutron,  the  first  term  in  (34)  disappears,  and  radiation  is  entirely  of 
polarization nature if 
       An incoming nucleon with an energy from several hundreds MeV to 1 GeV, interacts almost 
equally with a nuclear proton and neutron. Therefore the dipole excitation is suppressed and most 
essential  become  the  quadrupole  excitations.  Dipole  photons  are  coming  from  the  first  term  in 
(34),  while  quadrupole  from  the  second.  Because  of  important  contribution  of  the  quadrupole 
radiation the angular distribution is different from that in the electron-atom case (10), acquiring an

       10. Polarization radiation as a general phenomenon 
       In  the  previous  Sections  we  have  presented  what  can  be  considered  to  large  extent  as  the 
retrospective and current ideological status of the AB. Here in this Section we  
discuss  a  number  of  processes,  including  those  that  take  place  in  Nature,  where  AB  obviously 
persists  but  its  real  role  is  far  from  being  sufficiently  clear.  The  investigation  of  AB  under 
discussed below conditions presents a part of what I see as perspectives in this field.     

a.  Radiation in media and enhancement mechanisms 

       Above  in  this  paper  we  have  discussed  elementary  processes,  where  AB  is  created  in 
collisions of a single projectile with a single target. The proximity of several atoms in the target or 
electrons/atoms in the projectile can modify AB considerably. However, if the atomic density of 
the target is high enough, an incoming electron interacts with a number of atoms simultaneously, 
leading to serious modification of the media effective polarizability, which is illustrated by Fig. 3: 
  
                                                                                                           Projectile 

                                                                                                        Close-located polarized target  
                                                                                                        atoms 
 
                                                                                                      Electron cloud 
 
 
Fig. 3. Formation of a common induced dipole moment by a single projectile 
 
       If an incoming particle moves in amorphous media, the dipole momenta induced in different 
targets atom can effectively compensate each other, since on the average to each atom located at a 
given  distance  on  one  side  of  the  projectile  trajectory,  thus  totally  compensating  the  dipole 
 of 
momenta induced in each atom, as is illustrated in Fig. 4. It is seen that dipole moments 
four deformed atoms located symmetrically relative to the projectile can completely compensate 
each other:

Fig. 4. Suppression of induced dipole moments in a symmetric environment. 
        
       Random  distribution  of  target  atoms  guarantees  good  averaging  of  the  induced  dipole 
moment,  leading  for  long  enough  wavelengths  of  the  radiation  to  almost  zero  AB  values. 
However, if the target has a crystalline structure, there are directions and positions of trajectories 
inside  the  crystal,  following  which  the  AB  is  enhanced,  while  when  the  projectile  moves  along 
other  directions  AB  is  suppressed.  AB  for  crystal  or  amorphous  media  is  a  very  interesting 
subject, which is not yet investigated sufficiently well. 
       Essentially  different  becomes  the  situation, when  a  projectile  moves  parallel  to  surface  of  a 
crystalline body.  In this  case  AB is enhanced as  compared to that  for  an  isolated atom, if inter- 
atomic distance  gr  satisfies the relation 
.  
       If an atom moves parallel to a surface, the AB of the projectile as well as the target can be 
generated  due  to  action  of  the  projectile  upon  deformable  surface  potential  and  vice  versa.  Of 
interest  is  the  movement  of  a  relativistic  particle  near  a  ferromagnetic  or  anti-ferromagnetic 
surface. In the projectile coordinate frame the periodic magnetic field of the surface is transformed 
into periodic electrical potential that act opposite on the projectile nucleus and its electrons, thus 
inducing AB in the projectile. 
       If  a  surface  has  a  long-range  structure  with  periodicity  a  (e.g.  due  to  its  sound  long  wave 
oscillations), a relativistic projectile in it’s own coordinate frame due to Lorenz contraction feels a 
field with the period  γ/a
       b. Radiation in the processes of channeling  
       Channeling is a well-known process of radiation by a particle, in the first place a positron, that 
moves along one of the crystal axis. A good model of channeling is a potential tube, in which an 
incoming positron is moving under a small angle to the tube’s channel. Bouncing inside the tube, 
being repulsed from one side of the potential wall to another, the positron radiates. Since its speed 
is very close to that of light, the radiation is concentrated inside a very narrow cone near the axis, 
. The intensity of this directed radiation that can be considered in 
with an apex angle
principle  as  OB  is  very  high.  However  along  with  this  radiation,  AB  can  be  essential  in  this 
process. 
       Indeed, the wall of the channel is not structureless and rigid, but instead consists of atoms (or 
ions) of the crystal. When the positron approaches the atom of the wall, it became polarized and 
emits AB. As it was discussed in the previous subsection, it is possible that not a singe atom from 
the channels wall, but a group of them is polarized simultaneously. This enhances the AB of the 
wall.

       Till now we have investigated radiation caused by a single projectile: an electron, positron, 
atom or ion. However, in principle of interest is the situation, when the beam of projectiles is so 
dense that simultaneously not one but many electrons interact with a single target object: atom, 
fullerenes, cluster.  Schematic picture of this possibility is depicted in Fig. 5: 

                                                       Projectile dense beam

       The radiation in this case has to be proportional to the projectile density. It is evident that a 
sufficiently dense beam of same charge particles is hard to create due to their mutual Coulomb 
repulsion. This repulsion can be compensated by magnetic force, generated by the beam’s own 
current. Roughly speaking, the total number of electrons, participating simultaneously in AB 
generation

fullerenes.   
       d. Mechanical origin of radiation:  sound and shock waves, cracking 
       AB is generated always when positive or negative charges are moved in the collision process 
relative  to  each  other,  thus  dipolar  polarizing  the  target.  Until  now  we  have  discussed  only 
polarization  caused  by  incoming  electrons,  positrons  or  atoms.  However,  polarization  can  be 
caused by mechanical action as well. Indeed, if accelerated, an atom can become polarized since 
mechanical action can be different upon atomic nucleus and electrons. One should keep in mind 
that from the microscopic point of view mechanical motion (and action) of a body is a cooperative 
motion (action) of atoms that form the body. Therefore, it is natural that if this motion proceeds 
with  acceleration,  or,  better  to  say,  with  time-dependent  acceleration,  AB  is  generated. 
Propagation of ordinary sound serves as a first example of such a process. Being an oscillation of 
density of the media, a sound wave has to be accompanied by extra atomic collisions as compared 
to their number and intensity in the equilibrium state, thus generating AB. As it will be discussed 
in Section 12a, the AB spectrum generated in gas depends importantly on whether this gas consist 
of one sort of atoms or two and more: the radiation in the first case is at least by four orders of 
magnitude  less  intensive  than  in  the  second  case.  This  relation  has  to  be  valid  for  AB 
accompanying sound propagation.

       Shock waves that are formed in gases or plasma by fast moving objects are characterized by 
rapid variation of the gas density and pressure at the front of the shock wave. It means that a shock 
wave has to be a source of AB as well. 
       Creations  of  cracks  and  splitting  of  material  under  mechanical  tension  becomes  a  source  of 
radiation. It was demonstrated long ago that in the process of splitting of mica high-energy γ-rays 
are emitted with energies up to 3 MeV with a yield by about ten orders of magnitude higher than 
expected according to thermal equilibrium distribution (Perel’man and Khatiashvili, 1982).  
       When bodies are mechanically destroyed, on the sides of a crack oppositely charged layers are 
created. The relative motion of these layers generate radiation and can accelerate electrons that in 
their  turn  produce  BrS  in  general  and  AB  in  particular.  It  seems  that  investigation  of  radiation 
from e.g. different metal construction can help to detect the tensions inside the construction and 
serve  as  a  source  of  information  on  creation  of  cracks  in  material  at  early  stages  of  destruction 
processes.   
      e. Earth quakes  
       Powerful  radiation  during  earthquakes  was  registered  for  the  first  time  in  at  the  end  of  the 
seventies of the last century and since then it is studied as an important geophysical phenomenon. 
It  is  studied  also  with  the  aim  to  obtain  a  possibility  to  forecast  earthquakes.  Electromagnetic 
radiation  is  observed  during  all  the  seismic  dislocations,  in  particular,  during  foreshocks  and 
aftershocks  of  earthquakes.  Concentration  of  electrical  charges  on  the  banks  of  the  cracks  and 
consequent  recombination  of  these  charges  could  only  partially  explain  these  phenomena.  A 
theoretical approach to the generation of electromagnetic radiation that accompanies the process 
of mechanical destruction was proposed and applied to some simple systems relatively long ago 
by Khatiashvili and Perel’man (1989). It is worthwhile to note that formation and (or) oscillation 
of  dislocations  (see  Perel’man  and  Khatiashvili,  1982)  that  are  inevitably  accompanied  by  AB 
play an important role in the earthquake radiation. 
       Destruction of materials very often forms double layers that are oppositely charged. They are 
similar to electron-hole pairs created under the action of a projectile in atomic collisions. Relative 
movement  of  such  layers  generates  radiation.  In  rocks  they  the  double  layers  are  covered  with 
water jackets that affects generation of radiation. Note, that double layers in living cells transforms 
e.g. acoustic into electro - magnetic waves (see Perel’man and Khatiashvili, 1983).  
       f. Condensation of water and phase transitions 
       Formation  of  liquids  from  gases  and  solids  from  liquids  is  accompanied  by  considerable 
modification of their electronic structure. These processes are inevitably accompanied by inducing 
of multipole, mainly dipole moments and therefore by creation of AB. However, the real role of 
AB in these processes is unclear. Having in mind, however, the big scales of such processes as e.g. 
condensation in nature, the investigation of the AB role in such processes is not only interesting, 
but of great importance. Indeed, the amount of condensing water on the Earth is about 1020 g per 
year. The radiation of latent heat of steam condensation is thus very big and an essential part of it 
goes to radiation. 
       g. Radiation in the process of friction 
       Microscopically,  the  friction  of  two  bodies  in  contact  that  move  relative  to  each  other  is 
accompanied by mechanical motion of irregularities of contacting surfaces. The motion of these 
irregularities lead to their polarization and as a result generates AB. A simplified version of such 
process, which can serve as a model of it, is radiation of an “atom” that moves parallel to a regular 
potential structure that is depicted in Fig. 6:

Fig. 6 Radiation of a charge near a saw-like surface potential       
 
       The radiation can be generated due to motion of a charge parallel to a “saw”-shape periodic 
field that was called “Smith-Purcell” radiation and discovered about half a century ago by Smith 
and Purcell (1953)). However it is possible that potential "teethes" can be deformed, as is shown 
in the figure, and becomes a source of some kind of AB.  
       If  the  projectile  has  internal  structure,  it  can  be  dipolar  polarized  by  the  “saw”  potential 
depicted  in  Fig.  6  and  emit  AB.  It  seems  that  the  spectrum  of  it  has  to  have  a  resonance  at 
=ω
       h. Nuclear decay 
       Nuclear  decay  processes  are  also  accompanied  by  polarization  radiation.  Indeed,  in  a  decay 
process  a  nuclear  particle  moves  via  the  electron  shells  causing  their  deformation  and  as  a 
consequence AB emission.  
       To be concrete, let us start with  β- decay. Here one has several sources of radiation. At first, 
the electric charge of the nucleus is instantly altered due to transformation of e.g. one of nuclear 
neutrons into a proton: 
.  Instant variation of charge deforms or effectively polarizes 
the  electron  shells.  However  this  source  of  BrS  is  very  weak  since  the  decay  changes  the  field 
almost entirely spherically – symmetric, so that dipole excitations of the electrons are suppressed. 
However, instant change of the central field leads to so-called shake–off of atomic electrons that 
leave the atom relatively slow. BrS in general and AB in particular accompany this movement of 
electrons. The emission of a  β- electron leads to recoil of the nucleus.  That generates BrS in a 
way similar to that in neutron-atom collisions (see Section 7). The last source of  BrS is the  β-
electron itself that produces both OB and AB while moving from the nucleus through the electron 
shells.  
       The  −α decay as a source of radiation has some essential specific features as compared to the 
−β decay.  The  α-particle  is  by  five  orders  of  magnitude  heavier  than  the  β-electron.  So,  the 
recoil is considerably stronger, the instant change of the nuclear charge and corresponding shake-
off probability is bigger. Due to big mass the only radiation generated by the α-particle itself is 
AB.  
       Nuclear  fission  has  to  be  accompanied  by  separation  of  electrons  that  stick  to  the  fission 
products  and  become  released.  This  separation  generates  radiation,  a  part  of  which  can  be 
considered as AB. 
       It seems that investigating the  radiation from atomic electrons that  accompanies the nuclear 
decay and fission can give valuable information about the corresponding nuclear processes.

       Let  us  emphasize  that  in  this  subsection  we  have  discussed  the  radiation  that  comes  from 
deformation or polarization of electron shells of an atom (AB), the nucleus of which decays. Its 
typical ω is of the order of electron binding energies. However, radiation comes also from pure 
nuclear processes that have almost nothing to do with electron shells of the corresponding atom. 
The  nuclear  radiation  that  accompanies  nuclear  decay  or  fission  is  extensively  investigated  [see 
e.g. Tkalya, 1999, Maydanyuk and Olkhovsky, 2003.

i.  Laser ionization  
The action of an intense laser beam leads to multiple ionization of the illuminated atoms. For  
It  appeared  that  for  high  enough  intensities  multiple  ionization  of  atoms  have  relatively  high 
probabilities. This was explained as a result of inelastic scattering of one initially ionized electron 
by its parent atom (see Kuchiev, 1999 and references therein). Oscillating in the laser field, this 
electron acquires a big pondermotive energy 
ponE , 
Lω are the laser

LE  is much bigger than the ionization potential of the 
beam’s intensity and frequency. The energy

parent  atom  already  for  not  too  low 
L
).  Bouncing  in  the  laser  field,  this  electron  hits  the  parent  atom,  ionizing  it  or 
10
emitting  BrS  radiation.  This  process  repeats  times  and  again  since  the  electron  regains  the  lost 
energy  from  the  laser  beam.  From  the  point  of  view  of  this  paper  it  is  essential  that  in  each  of 
these collisions AB can contribute essentially to the total BrS intensity.  
        
11. “Exotic” processes  
       In  this  Section  we  will  discuss  generation  of  BrS  in  collisions  that  are  difficult  to  study 
experimentally  but  are  of  interest  to  clarify  the  role  and  features  of  AB,  or  PR.  We  will  also 
mention the possibility that other than photons particles can be created by a mechanism like AB.

       Of  prominent  theoretical  interest  is  such  an  exotic  process  as 
  scattering.  The 
distributed charge of  Ps  [see (4)] is equal to zero. Therefore all BrS in this collision comes from 
AB of  Ps  and from its excitation or disintegration. It is of interest to note that contrary to the fast

       Since the distributed charge of Ps is zero, the BrS generated in 
Ps + collisions is according 
to (19) determined by polarization of  Ps  caused by the distributed charge of the atom  A . As to

dominates (see Amusia and Soloviev, 1985; Amusia et al., 1992). 
       Another exotic object is the 
 scattering (see Amusia et al., 1992 and references therein). 
Since neutrino has no electric charge, OB can come only due to its magnetic moment. If not zero, 
it mast be however very small. So, neutrino radiates only due to the AB mechanism, by inducing 
dipole  moment  in  the  target  hydrogen  atom  because  eν and  pν interactions,  or  corresponding 
neutral currents, are different. The neutrino interactions are of short range and therefore, contrary 
 case, big exchange of momentum q are essential in AB generation. One has also to 
to the 
take  into  account  an  important  contribution  of 
  collision  with  spin-flip  of  the  atomic 
electron. It appeared that detection of AB resonant lines that come from excitation of the targets 
discrete levels could serve to determine the neutrino flux direction, when using polarized atomic 
hydrogen as a target. Note that at resonance frequencies the AB intensity is strongly enhanced, as 
compared  to  the  non-resonant  region.  This  enhancement  reaches  six  orders  of  magnitude  for 
incoming neutrino with the energy of 100 at. un.  
       Recent experimental production of anti-hydrogen atom,  H , gives another exotic object from 
the point of view of radiation generating. Of course, investigation of  H is of primarily interest as 
  collision  and  its 
fundamental  object  that  help  to  clarify  the  symmetries  in  Nature.  But 
are  of  interest  also  from  the  BrS  point  of  view.  For  fast  but  non-
comparison  with 
relativistic collisions dipole AB is not generated  in 
. Of 
course, OB for these heavy particles is negligible. It is interesting to note that for ultra-relativistic 
HH +
collisions the difference between 
       Basically the same mechanism as AB that compliments OB in forming the BrS spectrum can 
be  of  importance  in  producing  not  only  photons  but  also  other  Bose-particles,  both  with  and 
without rest mass. The simplest example is a phonon, i.e. a long-wave oscillations of the crystal 
structure of a solid body. The principal difference between photons and phonons is that a phonon 
can be created by a particle freely moving in the solid body, while a photon cannot be emitted by a 
freely moving particle. It means that OB for phonons, OBphon, is enhanced. However, ABphon also 
exists.  The  indirect,  via  a  mechanism,  similar  to  AB,  creation  of  excitons  is  also  possible.  At  a 
much  smaller  distance  and  much  higher  energy  scales  we  have  the  problem  of  π-meson 
production  in  nucleon-nucleus  scattering.  Here  along  with  direct  creation  of  π-mesons  by 
incoming  nucleon  a  process  similar  to  AB,  namely  π-mesons  production  via  virtual  nucleon-
vacancy excitations of the nucleus, must be taken into account.

       12. Some macroscopic manifestations 
       In this section we will discuss some macroscopic manifestations of polarization radiation. In 
several considered bellow examples it is essential that the target is really a multi-atomic object.

0T   in  boxes  with  outer  transparent  walls.  We

mechanism of cooling, apart of transferring the heat of gas to the walls (which for big volumes is 
not  important),  is  via  AB  emission.  However,  for  a  gas  that  consists  of  identical  atoms,  AB  is

constant.  After  opening  the  door  (see  Fig.  7b),  gases  A1  and  A2  mix  due  to  diffusion.  AB  then 
becomes intensified by a factor of 
 for pairs of different atoms thus dramatically increasing 
the rate of radiative cooling. Such an experiment would serve as an impressive manifestation of 
AB effectiveness. 
       b.   "Drug" currents of neutral particles 
       It is usually assumed that light pressure, which causes directed motion of heavy ions or atoms 
under  the  action  of  a  light  beam  is  on  the  microscopic  level  based  on  photon  elastic  back 
scattering.  However,  as  Amusia  and  Baltenkov  (1986)  have  demonstrated,  it  exist  another 
mechanism  of  light  pressure  that  is  efficient  for  heavy  atoms  or  ions  and  is  based  on  a  process 
reversed  to  AB,  namely  on  “Atomic”  or  polarization  absorption,  PA.  Schematically  this

       13. Qualitative schemes of some other alternative mechanisms 
       We will describe here some classical mechanisms of generating of electromagnetic radiation, 
in  which  turning  into  motion  or  deforming  of  the  target  by  a  projectile  creates  the  radiation.        
Fig. 9 depicts a dipole that is turned into rotation by an incoming charge. Note that the projectile 
can  also  emit  radiation  but  we  call  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  rotating  dipole,  e.g.  a  dipole 
molecule, can be a source of radiation.

Fig. 9. A dipole turned into rotation by a projectile 
 
This  mechanism  can  be  useful  in  modeling  the  radiation  of  dipolar  molecules  or  highly  excited 
atoms.  
     Fig. 10 depicts a more complex device, which consists of two dipoles. Without external action 
this  system  is  not  only  neutral,  but  also  has  no  dipole  moment.  But  an  incoming  charge  can 

25

  

deform  the  construction  inducing  a dipole  moment.  The  latter  will  change  in  magnitude  and 
direction as a function of the distance between the projectile and the target device. The space and 
time variation of the induced dipole moment of the target device led to emission of photons.

Fig. 11. A magnetic arrow, that rotates due to interaction with a moving magnet. 
       
        Of course, the mechanism Fig. 11 can be more complex and includes an option of the target 
magnet to be stretched under the action of the projectile. As a result the magnetic moment cannot 
only alter its direction but also the magnitude, thus in each case and in their combination leading 
to  emission  of  radiation.  Note  that  the  magnetic  arrow  and  static  magnet  can  be  arranged  using 
closed and electrical currents. 
       In all these examples the photon energy is taken from the projectile's kinetic energy, but the 
photon  is  emitted  by  the  dipole  moment  induced  in  the  target,  as  it  should  be  in  AB.  The 

26

  

microscopic  and  hence  quantum-mechanical  picture  of  the  devices  presented  in  Fig.  9-11  is  not 
yet developed.  
      In  principle,  some  other  schemes  to  produce  electromagnetic  radiation  could  be  suggested, 
namely those, in which the target would be not only deformed, but destructed. Such destruction 
would be inevitably accompanied by emission of radiation. 
 
       14. Conclusions 
       We  have  discussed  here  the  foundations  of  Atomic  Bremsstrahlung  (AB)  as  a  source  of 
mainly  continuous  spectrum  radiation  and  a  really  universal  phenomenon  that  is  essential  from 
nuclei  and  nucleons  (and  their  constituents)  to  atoms,  molecules,  clusters,  fullerenes  and 
macroscopic objects. We presented results of some calculations that show important and in some 
cases  decisive  role  played  by  AB.  We  discussed,  inevitably  briefly,  a  whole  variety  of  natural 
phenomena, where AB could be of importance. We presented non-trivial results for exotic objects 
that are far from being a possible direct object of experimental investigation but are of essential 
theoretical interest. We also discussed some new mechanisms, pure classical, where the target that 
is turned into motion in collision process, not the projectile, becomes a source of radiation. 
       Obviously, in this essay, which is not precisely what a review paper should be, far from all 
possibilities  are  discussed  or  even  mentioned.  At  the  beginning  of  the  research  in  this  field  and 
even  now,  while  thinking  about  AB,  I  imagine  collisions  of  different  objects,  from  quarks  to 
Galaxies,  where  not  only  photons  but  other  objects,  e.g.  gluons  and  gravitational  waves  are 
generated. Such fantasies are really inspiring and encouraging to see the World in its unity.  
       It  is  a  lot  to  be  done  in  this  domain.  What  bothers  however  is  that  in  spite  of  impressive 
activity  from  the  side  of  theory  there  are  quite  a  few  experimental  confirmations  of  AB  or  PB 
important  role.  The  experimental  verification  of  numerous  theoretical  predictions  in  this  field 
would be very important and encouraging for the theorists. It would also help a lot in establishing 
AB as a specific and different from OB mechanism of radiation.  I do hope that publication of a 
special  issue  of  the  Radiation  Physics  and  Chemistry  will  stimulate  the  research  activity  in  this 
domain.

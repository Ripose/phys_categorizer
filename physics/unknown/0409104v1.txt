INTRODUCTION 

Fluid  flows  play  the  key  roles  in  the  working  process  of  many  modern  engineering 
devices.  Designing  of  these  devices  for  the  required  operational  parameters  is  impossible 
without reliable prediction of characteristics of these flows. As many modern engineering 
devices are expensive and labor consuming in manufacturing, their physical modeling with 
experimental  determination  of  their  working  parameters  at  different  modes,  as  a  rule, 
requires  large  temporal  and  financial  expenses.  Besides,  due  to  restricted  possibilities  of 
modern experimental sensors and measuring instruments, experimental observations do not 
give  complete  information  about  the  investigated  phenomena.  Due  to  the  nature  of  fluid 
medium itself, fluid flows often occur in very complex way, with presence of transitional 
effects,  stagnation  zones  and  vortex  structures,  and  at  supersonic  velocities  –  also  with 
generation  of  compression  shock  waves.  The  situation  is  still  more  complex  when  heat 
transfer is present, when considering flow of a mixture of several substances, free surface 
flows,  flows  with  suspended  particles,  flows  with  cavitation,  boiling,  condensation, 
combustion, chemical reactions. 

All  these  factors  explain  the  growing  interest  for  the  software  tools  for  simulation  of 
fluid flows allowing for prediction of characteristics of these flows and working parameters 
of engineering devices at the stage of designing, before their manufacturing. The branch of 
science  dealing  with  simulation  of  fluid  flows  with  heat  and  mass  transfer  in  various 
engineering and natural objects is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 

As  the  computational  power  of  computers  grew  and,  at  the  same  time,  their  prices 
became  affordable  for  more  and  more  users,  since  the  70ies  of  XX  century,  rapid 
development  of  commercial  CFD  software  has  started.  Till  the  beginning  of  90ies,  this 
software  could  be  installed  only  at  powerful  computers  like  workstations.  In  90ies,  the 
cheap personal computers (PC) have become as powerful as those workstations, and CFD 
software packages designed for PC have appeared. 

(www-waterloo.ansys.com/cfx/),  Fluent 

Nowadays,  dozens  of  software  packages  intended  for  solution  of  fluid  flow  problems 
are  available.  A  lot  of  them  are  listed,  e.g.,  at  the  site  www.cfd-online.com.  Among  the 
CFD  software  most  recognized  worldwide  the  following  packages  should  be  mentioned: 
CFX 
(USA,  www.fluent.com),  STAR-CD 
(England,  www.cd-adapco.com,  www.adapco-online.com),  Numeca 
(Belgium, 
www.numeca.be),  etc.  The  packages  FlowER  (Ukraine,  www.flower3d.org)  and 
FlowVision (Russia, www.tesis.com.ru, www.flowvision.ru,  see  examples  of  computation 
also in [1]) are also worth to be mentioned. 

Initially,  computational  fluid  dynamics  was  developed  for  solution  of  problems  of 
aerospace  industry  –  simulation  of  processes  in  combustion  chambers  of  rocket  engines, 
simulation  of  physical-chemical  processes  in  the  flow  around  rocket  airframe  and 
supersonic aircrafts. Nowadays, field of application of CFD is essentially extended by civil 
engineering problems. 

According to information presented at those sites, we list some most important fields of 

 

1 

application  and  problems  solved  with  methods  of  CFD  using  the  commercial  software. 
Transport (by land, by sea, by air): prediction of resistance caused by upstream air or water 
flow, ventilation and fire safety of passenger compartments, simulation of fuel combustion 
in combustion chambers. Fluid machinery: prediction of performance curves and operation 
modes  of  pumps,  compressors  and  turbines  at  different  configuration  of  flow  passage, 
prediction  of  cavitation  phenomena.  Foundry:  simulation  of  the  founding  process. 
Construction:  prediction  of  wind  loads  on  buildings,  ventilation  and  fire  safety  of 
apartments. Power engineering: simulation of combustion flows in the burners and boilers 
of heat power plants. Ecology and natural disasters: simulation of distribution of pollution 
in water and air, simulation of expansion of fire in forests and towns. 

Methods of CFD assume computation of liquid and gas flows by numerical solution of 
Navier – Stokes and continuity equations (for turbulent flows – Reynolds equations) which 
describe the most general case of movement of fluid medium. The correspondent sequence 
of  actions,  from  creation  of  a  geometrical  model  and  specifying  boundary  conditions  to 
analysis of computation results, is described in the paper [2]. The present paper describes 
the additional model equations to be included into the set of model equations for simulation 
of fluid flows of multi-component and multi-phase media, compressible flows, flows with 
heat  transfer,  cavitation,  etc.  These  additional  model  equations  are  described  as  they  are 
implemented in the leading software tools. 

In  general,  tendency  of  development  of  the  leading  CFD  software  tools  is 
implementation of a set of mathematical models in each of them, allowing for simulation of 
all the physical phenomena that may occur in practice as full as possible. A user turns on 
the necessary model equations while setting a problem, in several mouse clicks, and then 
specifies relevant boundary conditions and other required data. In this paper, the examples 
of  problems  are  also  listed  that  can  be  solved  by  inclusion  of  correspondent  model 
equations. 

SIMULATION OF INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUID FLOWS 

1. Laminar flow. In the modern CFD software tools, the computation of liquid or gas 
flow  is  performed  by  numerical  solution  of  system  of  equations  that  describe  the  most 
general case of movement of fluid medium. These equations are of Navier – Stokes (1) and 
continuity (2):

For  these  equations,  a  brief  form  of  record  is  used  here.  The  summation  on  the  same 
indices is assumed, i, j = 1 … 3, x1, x2, x3 – coordinate axes, t – time. Full form of record for 
these  equations  in  curvilinear  coordinate  system  is  presented,  e.g.,  in  [3].  The  term  fi 
expresses the action of body forces. 

In  this  set  of  4  equations,  independent  parameters  being  sought  are  3  components  of 
velocity u1, u2, u3 and pressure p. Density ρ of liquid as well as gas under velocities below 
0.3 of Mach number is assumed to be constant. 

The boundary conditions are posed usually as follows. Zero velocities are set at all the 
solid walls. At the inlet section, the distribution of all the velocity components is specified. 
At the outlet section, first derivatives of velocity components (in the direction of flow) are 
assumed  to  be  zero.  The  pressure  is  present  in  the  equations  (1)  only  in  first  derivatives, 
thus,  the  user  needs  to  specify  pressure  only  at  any  arbitrarily  selected  node  of  the 
computational domain. 

2.  Turbulent  flow.  As  a  rule,  flows  in  engineering  are  turbulent.  Direct  modeling  of 
turbulent  flows  by  numerical  solving  of  Navier  –  Stokes  equations,  written  for  instant 
velocities,  is  still  extremely  difficult.  Besides,  as  a  rule,  of  interest  are  usually  time 
averaged  and not  instant  velocity  values.  Thus,  for  analysis  of  turbulent  flows,  instead  of 
Navier – Stokes equations (1), Reynolds equations (3) are used:

SIMULATION OF SINGLE-PHASE MULTI-COMPONENT FLOWS 

1. Flow of mixture of several incompressible media. When considering flow of mixture 
of two or several liquids (or gases – at small velocities of flow) with different densities, the 
density of mixture ρm becomes variable and depends on concentration. In order to calculate 
the concentration of some component of mixture in each cell of space, the system of model 
equations  is  supplemented  with  one  additional  differential  equation  in  partial  derivatives 
(DEPD) – equation of transfer of concentration C:

When n fluid components with densities ρ1, ρ2, …, ρn are mixed, in order to simulate the 
mixing  process,  the  system  of  model  equations  should  be  supplemented  with  n  equations 
(4), one own equation for each component. Imagine, for example, a vessel filled with fluid 
1, into which other fluids (2, 3, …, n) by several pipes are supplied, pumping the fluid 1 
away. At the initial moment, the concentration of fluid 1 in the vessel is 1, the concentration 
of other components is 0. In the pipes supplying the fluids to the vessel, on the contrary, the 
concentration of corresponding fluid is 1. As a result of computation, after each time step, 
the values of concentration C1, C2, …, Cn of each component in each cell of space will be 
obtained.

transfer, specific heat conductivity and heat capacity of the mixture are computed the same 
way. 

µm = C1 µ1 + C2 µ2 + … + Cn µn,

SIMULATION OF FLOWS WITH HEAT TRANSFER AND COMPRESSIBILITY 
1.  Variation  of  density  and  temperature  of  stationary  medium  under  forced 
compression.  Density  of  liquid,  except  for  some  special  cases  (e.g.,  hydroblow),  can  be 
considered  as  independent  on  pressure.  Density  of  gas  can  be  changed  by  forced 
compression in a closed volume. The equation that describes the dependence of temperature 
and density on pressure is known as the equation of state: 

p = ρ R T, 

 
 
 
where R = 287 joule / (kg K) – universal gas constant. 
The equation of state (8) is true for the perfect gas, i.e., when the interaction between 
molecules  occurs  by  elastic  collisions,  and  the  linear  size  of  molecule  is  small  in 
comparison  with  average  intermolecular  distance.  At  very  low  temperature  and/or  high 
pressure,  use  of  this  equation  can  cause  substantial  discrepancy  with  the  experimental 
observations  for  the  real  gas.  In  order  to  get  more  exact  results  in  this  case,  e.g.,  the 
equation of state suggested by Van der Waals may be used:

pc and Tc – pressure and temperature corresponding to the phase transition. 
2.  Simulation  of  flows  with  heat  transfer  in  case  of  incompressible  or  weakly 
compressible  fluid.  Temperature  of  fluid  can  change  due  to  heat  conductivity,  when  the 
fluid is in contact with a certain object (e.g., solid walls) which temperature differs from the 
temperature of fluid, or due to some processes inside fluid accompanied by heat generation. 
In flows of incompressible and weakly compressible fluid (at flow velocities below 0.3 
Mach  number),  density  of  fluid  depends  only  on  temperature,  and  influence  of  pressure 
differences on variations of density and temperature is negligible. From the computational 
point of view, in order to account for temperature variations, the system (1) – (2) should be 
supplemented with an additional DEPD – the energy equation:

When  considering  flow  or  incompressible  or  weakly  compressible  fluid,  having 
introduced the energy equation, we introduce in the system of equations a new independent 
unknown parameter, the temperature. Density of liquid (and gas – at low flow velocities) 
does not depend on pressure and depends only on temperature. 

The energy equation (10) allows for, e.g., simulation of heating of cold fluid flowing in 
a cavity with hot walls. Statement of problem requires specification of fluid temperature at 
the  initial  moment,  including  temperature  at  the  inlet  and  outlet  sections.  As  boundary 
conditions, temperature of cavity walls (if it is fixed during the considered process) or heat 
energy flux Qj through the walls (if heat energy flux is fixed) is specified. 

The  Eq.  (10),  written  for  time  averaged  values  in  order  to  simulate  turbulent  flows, 

looks as follows:

Such  form  of  presentation  for  equations  (2),  (3)  and  (12)  suits  for  simulation  of 
incompressible  fluid  flows.  For  compressible  fluid  flows,  density  is  also  subjected  to 
fluctuations,  and  with  the  Reynolds  time-averaging  procedure,  new  unknown  terms  are 
obtained. In order to avoid this, the Favre-averaging procedure is used, i.e., instantaneous 
values of variables are not only time-averaged, but also mass-averaged. This procedure and 
the obtained equations are described, e.g., in [4].

3.  Simulation  of  natural  convection  flows.  Even  in  a  vessel  with  initially  stationary 
fluid, the flow may occur due to uneven heating resulted in uneven density distribution. The 
examples  are  flows  in  oceans  and  atmosphere.  For  their  analysis,  gravity  force  should  be 
taken  into  account  in  Eq.  (1).  Natural  convection  flows  are  widely  encountered  also  in 
engineering,  in  particular,  in  chemical  industry.  Natural  convection  should  be  also 
accounted for in designing of heat and ventilation systems for apartments. 

4. Simulation of compressible fluid flows. In gas medium, temperature change can be 
caused  not  only  by  forced  heating  or  cooling,  but  also,  not  to  a  lesser  degree,  by  uneven 
distribution of density at high velocities. Density change can be caused not only by large 
temperature differences due to forced heating, but also by large pressure differences due to 
high  flow  velocities.  Density  of  gas  becomes  variable  though  space  at  velocity  about  0.3 
Mach  number  and  above.  For  simulation  of  so  high-speed  flows,  the  energy  equation 
should be written in the following form:

For  low-speed  flows,  this  equation  is  reduced  to  (10).  As  is  shown  in  the  paper  [4], 
order-of-magnitude  analysis  for  this  case  allows  for  discarding  terms  with  viscosity  and 
pressure.  However,  when  simulating  high-speed  flows  (above  0.3  Mach  number),  these 
terms play substantial role.

When considering flow of compressible medium (i.e., medium, which density depends 
essentially  on  pressure  differences),  having  introduced  the  energy  equation  (13),  we 
introduce two new unknown independent parameters – temperature and density. For closing 
the resulting system of equations, the equation of state (8) is used. This equation specifies 
relation between these parameters. 

In compressible fluid flows, pressure is contained in the system of equations not only in 
the  form  of  first  derivatives,  but  also  explicitly  –  in  the  equation  of  state  (8).  Therefore, 
statement  of  problem  requires  specification  of  distribution  of  pressure  (or  density)  at  the 
initial moment. 

The energy equation (13) allows for simulation of temperature variation caused not only 
by  forced  heating,  but  also  by  large  pressure  differences  occurring  at  high  velocities.  For 
example, in wind tunnels, creation of supersonic flow is accompanied by substantial drop of 
temperature of medium, and this effect can be simulated using this equation. 

As may be demonstrated, for compressible fluid flows, numerical behavior of system of 
model equations, with the Eq. (13) included, depends essentially on the Mach number M. 
Mach number is defined as ratio of average velocity of flow at some section to the acoustic 

 

5 

speed a for this medium. The acoustic speed (sound speed) is defined as follows: 

a

=

p
∂
ρ∂

. 

 

 

Acoustic  speed  is  the  speed  of  distribution  of  acoustic  waves  (compression  waves  of 
small amplitude) though the compressible medium. For ideal gas, this expression is reduced 
to the form 

 

p
ρ
where  γ  =  cp  /  cv  ,  i.e.,  the  ratio  of  specific  heat  capacities  at  constant  pressure  and 

a =

γ

, 

constant volume. 

If  flow  velocities  exceed  the  acoustic  speed  (M  >  1),  the  system  of  model  equations 
demonstrates hyperbolic behavior, thus not requiring to specify boundary conditions at the 
exit  of  computational  domain.  The  obtained  solutions  are  featured  with  so-called  shock 
waves  –  surfaces  of  jump  of  flow  parameters.  The  same  phenomenon  is  observed  in 
experiments.  Along  the  streamlines  crossing  the  shock  wave,  the  conservation  laws  for 
mass, momentum and energy are fulfilled. These laws are known as conditions of Rankine 
– Hugoniot and are formulated, e.g., in [5, 6]. 

5. Specifying dependencies of properties of medium on temperature. When simulating 
fluid  flows  with  heat  transfer,  as  source  data,  of  course,  laws  of  variation  of  physical 
properties  of  the  medium  (density,  viscosity, specific  heat  conductivity,  heat  capacity)  on 
the temperature should be specified. These properties may be specified in form of arrays. 
Thus, for computing properties at certain temperature, e.g., piecewise-linear approximation 
can be used. Then, for example, the density will be computed using the following formula: 
ρ
n
T
1
n
+
where T – temperature in a certain point of space, ρ(T) – corresponding density value, 
Tn, Tn+1 and ρn, ρn+1 – the nearest values of temperature, for which a user has specified the 
density, and corresponding values of density.

Viscosity,  specific  heat  conductivity  and  specific  heat  capacity  are  specified  and 
computed  the  same  way.  Density  of  gases  depends  not  only  on  temperature,  but  also  on 
pressure,  and  can  be  computed,  using  the  equation  of  state  (8).  In  modern  CFD  software 
tools,  the  database  of  most  widely  used  substances  (water,  air,  etc.)  is  already  available, 
where dependencies of their physical properties on temperature and pressure are stored. 

6. Simulation of heat transfer in solid medium. Conjugate heat transfer. The energy 
equation (10) can be used for simulation of heat transfer not only in fluids, but also in solid 
medium. As flow in this case is not available (i.e., u = 0), and full enthalpy is reduced to the 
form H = c T, where c is specific heat capacity of solid material, the energy equation (10) 
appears as follows:

(14) 

where ST – energy source inside solid body (if available). 
Equation  (14)  is  the  sole  equation  required  for  simulation  of  heat  transfer  in  solid 
medium. The only unknown variable in this equation is the temperature (i.e., distribution of 
temperature  inside  solid  body).  As  boundary  conditions  required  for  solution  of  this 
equation,  distribution  of  temperature  on  the  surface  of  computational  volume  that 
corresponds  to  the  solid  body  should  be  specified.  Instead  of  temperature,  heat  flux  Qj 
defined by Eq. (11) may be specified at a part of the surface. 

In engineering practice, necessity to solve problems of conjugate heat transfer is often 
encountered. Such problems imply conjugate computation of fluid flows and computation 
of  heat  transfer  in  a  solid  thick-walled  shell  encompassing  the  fluid.  In  such  cases,  fluid 
flows are simulated, e.g., by equations (1) – (2) and (10), and heat transfer in solid body is 
modeled  by  Eq.  (14).  At  the  interface  between  fluid  and  solid  phase,  the  condition  of 
equality  of  temperatures  and  heat  fluxes  from  the  fluid  and  solid  sides  are  stated.  An

example of heat transfer problem is computation of temperature field at the blades of a gas 
turbine, when those blades are forcedly cooled inside with cold fluid. Similar problem was 
solved, e.g., in [7]. 

 

 

 

SIMULATION OF MULTI-PHASE FLOWS 

1.  Introduction.  In  engineering  and  environment,  multi-phase  flows  of  very  different 
nature are met. They were reviewed, e.g., in [8]. We will distinguish the following types of 
multi-phase flows. First case – the considered volume is completely filled with a substance 
of one phase (e.g., liquid), and a substance of another phase in this volume is available only 
as discrete particles (of solid phase) or bubbles (of gaseous phase) which volume fraction is 
small  (below  10%  of  total  volume).  Second  case  –  the  considered  volume  is  partly  filled 
with liquid and partly with gas, and the substances of these two phases are immiscible and 
separated  one  from  another  with  free  surface.  Third  case,  the  most  complex  –  the 
substances of different phases can intermix (dissolve / deposit), and the volume fraction of 
the  substance of  second  phase  is  large  (above 10%  of  total  volume).  In  order  to  simulate 
multi-phase flows of these types, different approaches are used, which are described below. 
2.  Discrete  phase  model.  This  approach  is  used  for  simulation  of  two-phase  flows, 
when one of phases is presented in form of discrete particles, and volume fraction occupied 
by these particles is small (below 10% of total volume). Examples of such flows are water 
drops dispersed in airflow, air bubbles in liquid flow, solid particles in flow of air or water. 
The  substance  of  main  phase  is  supposed  to  be  continuous  medium,  and  its  flow  is 
simulated by Navier – Stokes (1) (or Reynolds (3)) and continuity equation. The substance 
presented in form of discrete particles does not form continuous medium; separate particles 
interact with flow of main phase and with each other discretely. In order to simulate motion 
of  particles  of  the  dispersed  phase,  Lagrangian  approach  is  used,  i.e.,  motion  of  each 
particle of the dispersed phase, under action of forces induced by flow of the main phase, is 
modeled individually. 

This model is appropriate for simulation of flows, for example, in spray dryers, cyclone 
separators,  fabric  filters,  at  erosion  of  valves,  at  fuel  injection  in  engines  (www.adapco-
online.com/adapco_online/uconf/nauc2002/mphase/index.html). The problems of such type 
often occur also in chemical industry, see, e.g., [9]. 

The  particles  of  dispersed  phase  are  assumed  for  simplicity  to  be  of  spherical  shape. 
Forces acting on a particle are caused by the difference in velocity between the particle and 
the fluid of main phase, and by displacement of the fluid by the particle. The equation of 
motion for such a particle was deduced in [10] and looks as follows:

Left-hand  side  of  Eq.  (15)  represents  sum  of  all  the  forces  acting  on  the  particle 
expressed  through  mass  and  acceleration  of  this  particle.  The  first  term  at  the  right-hand 
side  expresses  deceleration  of  the  particle  due  to  viscous  drag  against  the  fluid  flow, 
according  to  Stokes  law.  The  second  term  is  the  force  acting  on  the  particle  due  to  the 
pressure difference in the fluid around the particle caused by fluid acceleration. The third 
term is the force required for acceleration of virtual mass of fluid in the volume displaced 
by the particle. These two terms should be taken into account when density of fluid exceeds 
density of particles, e.g., when considering air bubbles in water flow. The forth term (Fe) is 
the  external  mass  force  that  acts  on  the  particle  directly,  e.g.,  gravity  force  or  force  of 
electric  field.  The  last  two  terms  are  centrifugal  force  and  Coriolis  force,  which  are 
available  only  when  considering  motion  in  a  relative  frame  of  reference.  Besides, 
sometimes  at  the  right-hand  side  of  (15)  some  additional  forces  should  be  taken  into 

 

7 

account (e.g., in flows with large temperature difference). 

The  Eq.  (15)  is  first-order  differential  equation  where  the  sole  unknown  value  is  the 
particle velocity vp, and the argument is time t. Fluid flow velocity vf in all cells of the space 
is assumed to be known. As source data, except for size and properties of the particle, its 
initial position is specified. It is indicated also, what will occur with the particle when it hits 
the  wall  or  another  particle.  For  performing  of  computation,  the  terms  containing  vp  are 
transferred  to  the  left-hand  side  of  Eq.  (15).  Particle  velocity  and  position  in  each 
subsequent  moment  is  determined  by  numerical  integration  of  all  the  other  terms  in  Eq. 
(15), with some time step ∆t. 

Coefficient of viscous drag Ccor at moderate Reynolds number, 0.01 < Rep < 260, can be 

computed, e.g., as follows

where Rep = ρf  | vf – vp | d / µ,   α = log Rep. 
In  modern  CFD  software  tools,  the  possibility  is  also  available,  to  simulate  heat  and 
mass exchange between dispersed particle and fluid flow, e.g., evaporation of a drop at low 
enough fluid pressure or high enough temperature. The algorithms implemented in Fluent, 
CFX,  STAR-CD,  allows  for  simulation  of  influence  on  the  fluid  flow  made  by  dispersed 
particles moving in this flow. As a first approximation, fluid density and viscosity, as well 
as some other parameters, are multiplied by (1 – αp), where αp is specific volume occupied 
by  discrete  particles.  Then,  at  each  further  time  step,  changes  in  mass,  momentum  and 
energy  of  discrete  particles  are  computed,  and  the  obtained  differences  are  added  to  the 
mass (2), momentum (1) and energy (10) conservation equations for fluid flow of the main 
phase,  in  form  of  source  terms.  Thus,  computation  of  fluid  flow  of  the  main  phase  and 
computation of motion of dispersed particles is performed jointly. 

If fluid flow of the main phase is turbulent, then trajectory of dispersed particles is not 
predetermined  and  depends  on  intensity  and  direction  of  turbulent  fluctuations.  An 
approach  for  simulation  of  impact  of  turbulent  fluctuations  of  fluid  flow  on  motion  of 
dispersed particles was suggested, in particular, in [11]. 

In  modern  CFD  software  tools,  several  boundary  conditions  are  implemented  that 
correspond  to  different  events  occurring  when  a  discrete  particle  hits  solid  wall.  The 
possible events are as follows: recoil due to elastic or inelastic impact, adhesion to the wall, 
creeping  along  the  wall  (in  dependence  on  physical  properties  and  angle  of  incidence), 
passing  through  the  wall  (if  the  wall  is  porous),  etc.  A  possibility  is  also  available,  to 
simulate  splitting  and  merging  of  water  drops  or  air  bubbles  when  they  hit  one  another, 
under certain conditions. 

3. Model of free surface flow. This approach allows for simulation of flow of two (or 
more) liquids or combination of liquid and gas that do not intermix and, being exposed to 
mass forces, form the clearly expressed interface, i.e., free surface. 

According  to  this  approach,  in  order  to  simulate  free  surface,  the  system  of  model 
equations is supplemented with the equation of transfer of the fill function F that expresses 
“concentration of liquid in gas” (when considering gas-liquid flow). This implies the name 
of  the  model  of  flow  –  VOF  model  (Volume  Of  Fluid,  i.e.,  volume  fraction  occupied  by 
fluid).

F equals 1 in the volume occupied by fluid and 0 in the volume occupied by gas. Only 
for cells crossed by the free surface, 0 < F < 1. Initial position of the free surface should be 
specified. The algorithm for numerical solution using this model is described in [12, 13]. 

Examples  of  problems  where  such  approach  is  appropriate:  filling  of  fuel  tanker, 
splashing or boiling in a vessel with free surface, simulation of flow around sea ships. In 
the paper [14], in particular, the CFD software tool FlowVision with VOF model was used 
for simulation of water flow around the car wheel driving in a puddle in the aquaplaning 
mode.

4. Multiphase mixture model. This approach allows for simulation of multi-phase flows 

when the substances of different phases can intermix and do not form the free surface. 

In order to simulate the flow of two or several phases, this model uses one continuity 
equation,  one  set  of  momentum  equations  and  one  energy  equation  that  are  written  with 
regard to mass-averaged velocity and density of the mixture. Thus, the continuity equation 
in this model looks as follows:

where ρm is density of the mixture (Eq. (5)), um is mass-averaged velocity, umj is velocity 
projection to the axis xj. On the index j, the summation is assumed. The term m represents 
mass transfer due to cavitation and/or other physical effects. By default, it equals zero. 

This  model  uses  the  conception  of  drift  velocities  to  take  into  account  that  motion  of 
different  phases  occurs  with  different  velocities.  This  allows  for  simulation,  e.g., 
deceleration of sand grains flying into a vessel filled with still fluid.

substance of k-phase relative to the mass-averaged velocity um. Eq. (18) defers from Eq. (1) 
by presence of the last term that simulates mutual slip of velocities.

where ρk is the density of substance of k-phase. From this equation, volume fraction Fk

5. Multi-phase Eulerian model. This model is the most general and the most complex 
among all the models of multi-phase flow. The substance of each phase is assumed to form 
continuous  medium.  Its  motion  is  simulated  with  own  system  of  Navier  –  Stokes 
(Reynolds) equations, continuity equation and energy equation. 

According  to  this  model,  the  equations  written  for  each  phase  are  solved  jointly.  An 
algorithm  for  computation  of  such  flows  was  suggested,  in  particular,  in  [15],  and 
implemented  in  CFX,  Fluent  and  STAR-CD  (see,  e.g.,  www.adapco-online.com).  This 
model  requires  the  most  of  computer  resources,  both  concerning  RAM  volume  and 
processor speed. 

This model is appropriate for simulation of flows, e.g., in 2-phase mixing vessel (gas-
liquid  mixer),  fluidized  bed,  settling  tank,  gas-lift  reactor,  liquid-liquid  extraction  column 
(see www.adapco-online.com/adapco_online/uconf/nauc2002/mphase/index.html). 

6. Additional recommendations for selection of a multi-phase flow model. In order to 
simulate  flows  where  the  substances  of  different  phases  intermix  and  do  not  form  the 
interface, in many cases both discrete phase model, mixture model and Eulerian model can 
be used. Additional criteria for selection of the most proper model are as follows [16]. 
- Mass density ratio β of the dispersed phase (d) to that of the carrier phase (c): 

 

F
d
F
c
where Fd and Fc are volume fractions, γ is ratio of densities of the dispersed and carrier 
phase, γ = ρd / ρc; this ratio can be above 1000 for solid particles in gas flow, about 1 for 
solid particles in liquid flow, and below 0.001 for gas particles in liquid flow. 

γβ =

(20) 

, 

When the ratio β is very low, the dispersed particles almost do not influence the carrier 
flow;  thus,  any  of  the  listed  models  can  be  used.  At  very  high  values  of  β,  the  dispersed 
particles  strongly  influence  the  carrier  flow,  and  only  the  multi-phase  Eulerian  model 
should be used for adequate simulation of such flows. At moderate values of β, in order to 

 

9 

select the proper model, it is necessary to calculate the Stokes number as follows. 

- Stokes number St: 

St =

, 

t
d
t

c

(21) 

where  td  is  characteristic  time  of  particle  motion,  td  =  (ρd  dd

2)  /  (18  µc),  dd  is  particle 
diameter, µc is viscosity of substance of the carrier phase, tc = Lc / Uc is characteristic time 
of carrier flow, Lc is characteristic length, Uc is characteristic velocity. 

At St << 1.0, dispersed particles almost do not deflect from the carrier streamlines; thus, 
any of multi-phase models can be used (as a rule, the mixture model, as the least resource 
consuming). At St > 1.0, trajectories of dispersed particles do not coincide with the carrier 
streamlines  at  all.  Thus,  the  mixture  model  is  inapplicable  here;  either  the  discrete  phase 
model or the Eulerian model should be used. 

7. Simulation of flows with cavitation. When, at constant temperature, the pressure of 
liquid decreases below the saturated vapor pressure, the liquid loses continuity, and bubbles 
filled with vapor are formed in it. Besides, the liquid can contain other dissolved gases, in 
form  of  micro-bubbles. When  the  pressure  decreases  further,  these bubbles  can  grow  and 
form extensive cavities. If the pressure increases, these bubbles and cavities will collapse, 
vanishing and disappearing in the liquid. This entire process is called cavitation. Cavitation 
is accompanied with very strong and abrupt jumps of density, pressure and temperature; the 
flow becomes very unstable. The phenomenon of cavitation was described in detail, e.g., in 
[17]. 

In the modern CFD software tools, different approaches for simulation of cavitation are 
used.  One  of  the  most  promising  approaches  was  suggested,  e.g.,  in  [18].  In  order  to 
simulate  cavitating  flows,  as  a  rule,  the  free  surface  model  or  the  mixture  model  is  used. 
The  Eulerian  model  is  hardly  expedient  to  use,  due  to  low  values  of  parameters  β  and  St 
(Eq. (20) and (21)) in such flows. 

It is assumed that the liquid, its vapor and other gases with specified physical properties 
may be present in the computational domain. In the model equations of the mixture model, 
some  terms  that  represent  heat  and  mass  transfer  due  to  cavitation  are  introduced.  These 
terms were suggested, in particular, in [18]. 

OTHER POSSIBILITIES OF SIMULATION OF FLUID FLOWS 

In  the  modern  CFD  software  tools,  a  number  of  other  possibilities  for  simulation  of 

fluid flows are implemented. Some of them are briefly described below. 

1.  Non-Newtonian  fluid  flows.  In  common  (Newtonian)  fluids,  shear  stress  τ  in  a 
certain  liquid  volume  obeys  the  Newtonian  law,  i.e.,  is  proportional  to  the  rate-of-
deformation tensor D for that volume, τ = µ D, where

, 

µ – dynamic viscosity coefficient that do not depend on D. 
In non-Newtonian fluids, to which belong, e.g., paraffin, wax, honey, tar, the viscosity 

coefficient µ depends on D. 

The dependence µ (D) should be specified as source data for computation of flows. By 
now,  a  number  of  approximate  laws  were  suggested  that  describe  this  dependence  for 
different non-Newtonian fluids. This topic is described with more details, e.g., in [19]. 

2.  Flows  through  porous  medium.  Flows  with  distributed  resistance.  In  some  cases, 
fluid  flows  are  hindered  by  a  host  of  small  solid  obstacles  that  influence  the  flows 
substantially but are too small in size to be modeled individually. Examples of such flows 
in  the  nature  are  air  motion  though  a  forest,  water  flow  in  a  river  stuffed  with  algae.  In 
engineering: liquid or gas flows though a porous filter element, gland, perforated plate or 
honeycomb. 

For simulation of such flows, as a rule, a host of small solid elements that obstacle the 
flow  are  replaced  by  the  entire  uniformly  distributed  resistance.  In  order  to  simulate  this 
resistance,  an  additional  source  term  Si  is  introduced  to  the  right-hand  side  of  the 
momentum equations (1):

matrixes  equal  zero.  Here  α  is  permeability;  C2  is  internal  resistance  coefficient.  Then  Si

At low velocities of flow, when the flow is laminar, only the first part of the term Si is 
essential.  When  neglecting  the  convection  acceleration  and  diffusion,  the  equation  of 
motion though the porous medium is reduced to Darcy’s Law:

At  high  velocities  of  flow,  on  the  contrary,  only  the  second  part  of  the  term  Si  is 
essential. The coefficient C2 may be understood as loss factor per unit of length in the flow 
direction. Thus, pressure drop may be presented as the function of dynamic head:

where γ is porosity of the medium, i.e., volume fraction occupied by the fluid medium. 
3.  Flows  with  radiating  heat  transfer.  As  it  is  known,  there  are  three  ways  of  heat 
transfer:  by  convection,  by  diffusion  and  by  radiation.  The  energy  equation  (10)  or  (13) 
allows  for  simulation  of  only  two  former  types  of  heat  transfer.  In  many  engineering 
problems,  radiating  heat  transfer  may  be  neglected.  However,  it  can  play  the  dominating 
role  when  very  high  temperature  differences  are  present.  Radiating  heat  flux  Qrad,  e.g., 
4), where Tmax and Tmin – 
between hot and cold walls, is expressed as Qrad = σ (Tmax
temperature of hot and cold walls, σ = 5.67 • 108 W / (m2 K4) – Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 
From  the  physical  point  of  view,  radiating  heat  transfer  is  the  flow  of  photons  of  certain 
frequency range. Like light beams, radiating heat is transferred along straight lines. 

4 – Tmin

Fluid flowing in the volume subjected to radiating heat transfer is heated from hot walls 
by  convection  and  diffusion.  Besides,  if  the  fluid  medium  is  not  completely  transparent, 
radiating  heat  is  transferred  to  the  flow  also  directly.  In  order  to  simulate  this  process,  a 
new  term  is  added  to  the  energy  equation  (10)  or  (13).  Appearance  of  this  term  is 
determined according to the assumed  model of radiating heat transfer. Review of modern 
models of radiating heat transfer is presented, e.g., in [20]. 

An example of problem that demonstrates the radiating heat transfer is included in the 
demo-version  of  CFD  software  tool  FlowVision,  which  can  be  freely  downloaded  at 
www.flowvision.ru. 

4.  Flow  with  chemical  reactions  and  combustion.  In  the  system  of  model  equations, 
the  equations  of  concentration  transfer  (4)  for  each  component  of  the  mixture,  and  the 
energy  equation  (10) or  (13) should  be  included.  Besides,  the  equations for  simulation  of 
chemical reaction or combustion process are introduced. For a number of typical reactions 
(in  particular,  methane-air  burning),  the  corresponding  models  are  already  developed  and 
implemented  in  modern  CFD  software  tools.  Besides,  these  software  tools  contain  some 
interface for user programming. Thus, experienced enough users can create an appropriate 
model for some specific reaction. 

Combustion flows usually feature with very strong turbulent fluctuations that influence 
essentially the flow pattern. In order to simulate this phenomenon, e.g., in FlowVision, k – ε 

 

11 

turbulence model is supplemented with a special equation for modeling of fluctuations. 

5. Prediction of acoustics. In a number of modern CFD software tools, a possibility for 
prediction of intensity and frequency characteristics of aerodynamically generated noise is 
implemented. As source data for such prediction, the results of computation of fluid flow 
with non-stationary Navier – Stokes (or Reynolds) equations are required. 

In order to predict acoustics properly, the flow should be computed using LES or DNS 
[2]  turbulence  model,  because  these  models  ensure  the  best  resolution  of  pressure 
fluctuations occurring in the flow. The matter is, these fluctuations are the main source of 
aerodynamically generated noise. 

CONCLUSION 

A  review  of  fluid  flow  models  implemented  in  the  leading  CFD  software  tools  is 
presented.  The  described  models  are  designed  for  simulation  of  multi-component  and 
multi-phase  flows,  compressible  flows,  flows  with  heat  transfer,  cavitation  and  other 
phenomena.  As  is  demonstrated  in  a  number  of  publications,  these  software  tools  (CFX, 
Fluent,  STAR-CD,  etc.)  allow  for  adequate  simulation  of  complex  physical  effects  of 
different nature, even for problems where performing of physical experiment is extremely 
difficult.

perturbatively the bounded operators that generate the quantum states, and

to deﬁne a non-Gaussian density operator.

The Duﬃng oscillator is a typical anharmonic oscillator whose classical aspect is rel-

atively well-understood [1].

It has been studied in many ﬁelds of physics from classical

mechanics to quantum mechanics, especially as a toy model for one-dimensional quantum

ﬁeld theory. In particular, more physical interests have been focused on the application of

various perturbation techniques both as a classical and as a quantum model [2].

In this paper we study the quantum Duﬃng oscillator, a time-independent quantum

anharmonic oscillator,

Even though one can ﬁnd in principle the exact quantum states by solving the time-

independent Schr¨odinger equation, the results of most of attempts are minimal.

In this Letters to Editor we shall propose a mean-ﬁeld approach to the quantum Duﬃng

oscillator, which has the following points diﬀerent from other approaches:

It takes into

account a physically meaningful frequency that is quite close to the exact classical one.

There appear no secular terms at least at the order of mλ for the coupling constant up

to a critical value. A kind of renormalization can be used at the order of (mλ)2. The

motivation for this approach is based on two observations: both the extremization of the

Dirac action and the quantum Liouville equation at the quadratic order with respect to the

vacuum state of a Fock space lead to the same mean-ﬁeld equation. We ﬁnd a complex

solution whose frequency is the same as the exact classical one at the order of mλ, construct

the operators on the Fock space that generate the exact quantum states perturbatively, and

deﬁne a non-Gaussian density operator.

A general Fock space is constructed by the basis (¯h = 1)

ˆa† = uˆp + v ˆq, ˆa = u∗ ˆp + v∗ ˆq

where (u∗v

uv∗) = i follows from the usual commutation relation

ˆa, ˆa†

equation

We expand the Hamiltonian operator in terms of the creation and annihilation operators

where ˆH2 and ˆH4 are quadratic and quartic in ˆa† and ˆa. Then, ˆa† and ˆa satisfy the approx-

It is remarkable that the mean ﬁeld equation takes already the same frequency at the order

of mλ as the exact classical frequency [1], which is diﬀerent from those in Refs. [2,4].

For a weak coupling constant we solve Eq. (7) order by order in mλ. The lowest order

equation is Eq. (9), which has already been solved. At the next order, we obtain

and all the derivatives act only on the coeﬃcient functions b3

where α = λ

4mΩ3 . All the eigenvalues of Eq. (18) are real constants up to the critical coupling

constant αc = λc
4mΩ3

≃

0.1365. For the coupling constant larger than λc, a secular term of an

exponential function begins to appear. This implies that for the strong coupling limit the

Fock space basis may not be suitable for constructing bounded operators such as ˆA† and ˆA

that generate the quantum states. On the other hand, for the weak coupling limit (α << 1),

numericals result show that ~b3

(c3

1e−i3αΩt, c3

2ei3αΩt, c3

3e−i3αΩt). For α = 0, the

result is exact with the eigevalues (

4Ω,

2Ω, 0, 2Ω). The freedom in choosing the norms

∼

−

of eigenvectors of Eq. (18) may be used to keep the same equation as Eq. (9), a kind of

renormalization, even at the order of (mλ)2. Thus, the operators, Eq. (13), are bounded

operators whose coeﬃcients are proportional to λ

mΩ2 .

Finally, we discuss on the density operator deﬁned as

ˆρ = e−Ω0 ˆA† ˆA.

(19)

The density operator, Eq. (19), satisﬁes manifestly the quantum Liouville equation (7) by its

construction at the order of mλ. It would be worthy to compare it with the Gaussian-type

density operator that was constructed for a time-dependent Duﬃng oscillator [5], because

the operators ˆA† and ˆA can also work for the time-dependent Duﬃng oscillator (in fact, the

complex solution (10) is an adiabatic one in this case) and, furthermore, Eq. (19) already

went beyond the quadratic order for the Gaussian-type.

The details of this approach and some problems such as the divergence structure of the

operators ˆA† and ˆA and the relation with the renormalization group approach [6,4] will be

addressed in a future publication [7].

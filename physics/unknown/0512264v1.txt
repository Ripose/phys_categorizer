The  optimal  scaling  problem  for  the  time  t(L×L)  between  two  successive  events  in  a  seismogenic  cell  of  size  L  is
considered. The quantity t(L×L) is defined for a random cell of a grid covering a seismic region G. We solve that problem
in terms of a multifractal characteristic of epicenters in G known as the tau-function or generalized fractal dimensions;
the  solution  depends  on  the  type  of  cell  randomization.  Our  theoretical  deductions  are  corroborated  by  California
seismicity with magnitude M ≥ 2. In other words, the population of waiting time distributions for L = 10-100 km provides
positive information on the multifractal nature of seismicity, which impedes the population to be converted into a unified
law  by  scaling.  This  study  is  a  follow-up  of  our  analysis  of  power/unified  laws  for  seismicity  (see  PAGEOPH  162
(2005), 1135 and GJI 162 (2005), 899).

1. Introduction

Bak  et  al.  (2002)  introduced  into  seismicity  statistics  the
notion of a unified scaling law as a generalization of the power
law. To clarify this term, let us consider a seismic zone G cove-
red  by  a  regular  grid  of  mesh  size  L.  Let ξ(L×L)  be  a  statistic
based  on  seismic  events  of  magnitude  M > mc  in  an  L×L  cell
during time ∆T. The statistic ξ generates a unified law, if there
is  a  normalizing  constant  aL  such  that  the  distribution  of  aL
ξ(L×L) when averaged over seismogenic cells is independent of
L, mc and ∆T. The type of the averaging has to be specified.

The  example  considered  by  Bak  et  al.  (2002)  is  concerned
with the time between successive events, t(L×L). The distributi-
tons were averaged in proportion to the number of events in the
L×L cell, and the normalizing constant aL had the form aL = λL,
where

Here, b is the b−value in the Gutenberg-Richter law, L0 is the
external scale, and df  was treated as a fractal dimension.

Corral (2003) proposed another example in which ξL  is  the
rate, λ(L×L), of M>mc events in an L×L cell. The distribution of
λ(L×L) /λL  over  seismogenic  cells  is  treated  as  a  unified  law.
The  general  approach  relates  an  L×L  cell  to  a  distribution
having  a  unit  jump  at  the  point  λ(L×L)>0,  these  distributions
being averaged with equal weights.

The  relation  between  the  normalizations  in  these  two

examples follows from the equality

   E t(L×L) = 1 /λ(L×L).

   (2)

Other  examples  can  be  found  in  Baiesi  and  Paczuski  (2004),
Lise et al. (2004), Davidsen et al (2005), Davidsen and Paczuski
(2005).  All  such  examples  are  of  great  interest  for  a  better
understanding  of  seismicity,  unless  they  are  corollaries  from
facts that are already known: the Gutenberg-Richter power law
for  energy,  the  Omori  attenuation  power  law  in  time,  and  the
fractality of events in space.

As  a  rule,  unified  laws  are  approximate  and  are  in  need  of
restrictions on L, mc and ∆T, since the theoretical result by Mol-
chan (2005) asserts that the statistic t(L×L) generates  a  unified
law  at  the scales L<L0 only  if  the  rate  of  M>mc  events  is  uni-
form on its support, i.e. df=0, 1 or 2. Real observable seismicity
is  organized  differently.  The  commonly  accepted  hypothesis
assumes it to be fractal, i.e., d to be non-integer. Researchers are
not  as  unanimous  concerning  the  assumption  that  the  spatial
distribution of events is a multifractal (see, e.g., pro: Geilikman
et al., 1990; Goltz, 1997; Sornette and Ouillon, 2005 and contra:
Eneva, 1996; Gonzato et al., 1998). The scepticism stems from
the difficulties inherent in estimating the singularity spectrum of

a multifractal and in the undoubted difference between a sophi-
sticated  abstract  notion  of  multifractality  and  observed  reality.
The  utmost  to  be  derived  from  observable  data  is  a  statement
like  this:  seismicity  looks  as  a  multifractal  in  a  range  of  scale
∆L.  We  have  inferred  this  for  M ≥2  California  events  in  the
range  ∆L=10−100  km;  a  similar  inference  for  M≥3  seems
questionable (Molchan and Kronrod, 2005).

Given  that  epicenters  are  multifractal,  the  choice  of  the
exponent  df    in  (1)  becomes  non  unique.  From  the  very
representation λ(L×L)∝ Ld it follows that, when L is small, the
parameter d plays the part of an indicator of singularity/smooth-
ness  for  seismicity  rate.  It  is  only  for  a  monofractal  that  the
indicator is unique. For this reason the property of multifracta-
lity and the existence of unified laws are largely incompatible.
However,  treating  the  laws  as  approximate  ones,  one  can  look
for  the  optimal  form  of  scaling  for  the  statistic  ξ(L×L)  that
aspires to be the unified law. This problem has been solved for
ξ =λ(L×L) by Molchan and Kronrod (2005). We use the multi-
fractal  formalism  to  find  theoretically  the  index  df    in  (1)  for
small L. It is a function of the weights involved in the contribu-
tions  of  different  L×L  cells.  (In  the  examples  cited  above,  the
weight of an L×L cell is proportional to λp(L×L) with p=1 and
p=0). The data observed in California (M >2 events) have corro-
borated the predicted values of df. Thereby we have obtained an
independent  confirmation  for  the  multifractality  of  M ≥2  epi-
centers.

Below we propose a general approach to the optimal spatial
scaling  of  t(L×L)  and λ(L×L)  based  on  the  multifractal  forma-
lism. In spite of relation (2) connecting them, the two problems
of  scaling  t(L×L)  and  λ(L×L)  are  different.  It  is  sufficient  to
remark  that  a  simple  averaging  of  λ(L×L)  and  E t(L×L)=
λ-1(L×L) over the cells responds to small values of λ differently.
In the generic situation therefore, the averages of λ(L×L) and of
t(L×L)  are  scaled  over  L  differently.  Similarly  to  the  case
ξ=λ(L×L),  we  are  going  to  corroborate  the  efficiency  of  the
multifractal  ideology  for  dealing  with  the  spatial  scaling  of
t(L×L).

The subsequent text is organized as follows: Section 2 pro-
vides the statement of the problem of scaling ξ (L×L); Section 3
contains basic information about multifractals; Section 4 gives a
theoretical  solution  as  to  the  choice  of  the  scaling  index  df  for
t(L×L) and λ(L×L); in Section 5 the prediction of df for t(L×L) is
checked  using  California  events  with  M ≥ 2.  Lastly,  Section  6
discusses the nature of the asymptotic distribution of t(L×L) for
small values.

2. Statement of the Problem

Suppose aL ξ(L×L) is a suitable normalization of the statistic
ξ(L×L)≥0 such that the averaged distributions of aL ξ(L×L) are
weakly dependent on the scale parameter L. If the unified law is
approximately  valid, 
the  averaged  distributions  of
aLξ(L×L),  FL,  are  close  to  one  another  for  different  L,  though
not exactly coincident. One asks how one is to choose aL or, as
in the case of t(L×L) and λ(L×L), how one is to choose d (1).

then 

It can be assumed theoretically that we have to deal with an
infinite  set of  distributions  {FL}  in  the  limit  L→0.  One  knows
(Feller, 1966) that, given any infinite sequence of distributions,
one can always select there a subsequence that would converge
to a non-decreasing function. The limit may be a constant, cor-
responding  to  a  distribution  that  is  concentrated  at 0  and ∞.  A
limit of this sort is of no interest whatever. For this reason the
normalizing constant aL or the scaling index df should be rejec-
ted, if any possible limit for the family {FL(x)} can be a cons-
tant only in 0<x<∞. Indices df  that do not possess the property
indicated will be called suitable.

Assuming the rate of events to be multifractal, we are faced
with  the  problem  of  describing  all  suitable  values  of  df.  If  the
index is a single one, one can expect FL, L → 0 to converge to a
non-trivial limit, hence expect FL to be close to one another for
small L.

The definition of a unified law involves the averaging ope-
ration which requires to be specified. We shall consider below
the  following  one-parameter  family  of  weights  for  L×L  cells
with λ(L×L) > 0:

   w (p)(L×L) = [λ(L×L) / λ(G)] p / RL (p)

   (3)

where  RL (p)  normalizes  the  weights  to  unity,  and  p  is  a  para-
meter, | p | < ∞.

(p) =ξ(L×L). Then the random variable ξL

The weights  {w(p)}  can  be  treated  as  a  probability  distribu-
tion  on  earthquake-generating  L×L  cells  that  cover  G.  Let  us

is identical with the distribution of ξ(L×L) in the cell having the
greatest rate λ(L×L).

Below  we  describe  suitable  values  of  df    for  the  family  of
weights  (3)  at  any  fixed  p≥0.  To  do  this,  we  shall  need  some
basic facts related to multifractals (see, e.g., Feder, 1988).

3. Multifractal Seismicity.

Let the measure λ(dg) be the rate of M >m events in an ele-
ment of area dg in region G. The measure λ(dg) is treated as a
multifractal, if its support stratifies into  a  set  of  fractal  subsets
Sα having Hausdorff dimensions f (α). In addition, the points in
Sα  possess  the  following  property:  for  any  point  g∈Sα  there
exists a sequence of L×L cells as L→0 such that

   log λ(L×L) = α log L (1+o(1)).
In other words, α describes a type of spatial concentration of
events  or  the  singularity  type  for  λ(dg).  The  pairs  (α, f (α))
form  the  multifractal  spectrum  of  the  measure.  Information  on
the spectrum can be gathered from the Renyi function

The  function  τ(q)  is  concave  (see  an  example  in  Fig.1)  and

concave and smooth, then the interval of values of

the  interval  of  possible  singularities  of  the  measure,  while  the

allows the spectrum of the measure to be described through the

content of multifractal formalism which has been justified for a
large  class  of  measures  interesting  for  applications  (see,  e.g.,
Pesin, 1997).

The  quantities  dq =τ  (q)/  (q−1)  are  known  as  generalized
 the
dimensions, in particular, d0  is the box dimension, d1=
information dimension, and d2=τ(2) the correlation dimension.
Since  τ (q)  is  a  concave  function,  dq  does  not  increase  with
increasing q. One has from τ (1)=0:

(1981), if λ(Sα)>0, then α=f (α), i.e., the type of singularity also
specifies  the  dimension  of  points  of  that  type.  All  solutions  of
α=f (α)  belong  to  the  interval  [

From  (4)  it  follows  that  in  the  scaling  relation λ(L×L)∝Ld  the

dimension  of  the  seismicity  support,  and  the  choice  of  it  may
depend on the problem under consideration, since a multifractal
is described by the spectrum of singularities.

4. Scaling of t  (L×L): A Theoretical Approach.

The scaling of the random variable t(L×L) proposed by Bak
et al. (2002) may be interpreted as follows. For stationary seis-
micity one has the relation E t(L×L)=1/λ(L×L). Consequently, it
is  sufficient  to  scale  the  rate  λ(L×L)  for  a  typical  L×L  cell.
Using  the  Gutenberg-Richter  law  and  the  fractality  of  seismi-
city, we arrive at the normalizing function (1). The notion of a
typical  cell  is  determined  by  the  choice  of  the  weights
{w(p)(L×L)};  p=1  in  the  Bak  case.  The  rate λ(L×L)  when  ave-
raged using the weights w(1)(L×L) is scaled with the index df =d2
(see  below),  which  is  the  choice  of  Bak  et  al.  (2002).  These
arguments  are  rather  crude  for  multifractal  seismicity.  We  are
going  to  show  that  the  scaling  of  the  means  of λ(L×L)  and  of
t(L×L)  are  different,  and  are  also  different  from  the  scaling  of
the distributions of these variables.

Since (6) holds in the range ∆L and τ(p), 0≤p≤3 is nonlinear,
we infer that the rate of M≥2 events in G looks as a multifractal
in the scale range 10–100 km (Molchan and Kronrod, 2005).

The variant with equal weights (p=0) is not considered because

5. Scaling of t(L×L): An Empirical Approach.

We used the ANSS (2004) catalog of M≥2 California events

within 100 km depth for the period 1984-2004. Two events
were counted as one, when the spatial and time distances
between the two did not exceed 1 km and 40 seconds, respec-
tively. The spatial region G can be seen in Fig. 2; its linear size
is L0 = areaG = 998.16 km, and the total number of events in
G is N =125144.

When  seen  on  the  log  scale,  one  usually  notes  a  flat  region  in
the p.d.f. of ηp,d, p=1 for small times (η<-6) and an exponential
part for large times (Bak et al., 2002). This is also borne out by
Fig. 3. The ordinary scale and different p are not popular when
deriving unified laws, although the differences in p.d.f. for dif-
ferent L and p are obvious. We recall that the weight of seismi-

city clusters increases with increasing p. For moderate values of
L  (L>40  km)  the  space-time  clusters  are  not  yet  destroyed  by
the L×L grid. As a result, the density of ηp,d for these L is bim-
odal  if  p=2  and  unimodal  if  p=1.  This  kind  of  behavior  is  not
affected by selecting d in the interval (0.5, 2). The left mode in
Fig. 3b (the case p=2) disappears, when the three most intensive
aftershock  zones  have  been  eliminated  (see  Fig.  1).  In  other
words, the log-log scale provides a simplified representation of
how waiting times are distributed.

We note (as being important for what follows) a correlation
between  empirical  distributions  of ηp,d  for  different  L.  Denote
by  ∆t(L)  the  waiting  time  after  an  event  A  in  an  L×L  cell,  and
suppose that cell to be embedded in L1×L1, L<L1. One has ∆t(L1)
≤∆t(L), because L1×L1 contains more events. For this reason the
quantities

which  define  the  boundaries  of  the  empirical  distribution  of
( p
,  must  decrease  with  increasing  L.  The  situation  changes
Lt
after  the  normalization  of  t(L×L),  because  the  factor  Ld
increases  with  L.  The  effect  of  normalization  can  be  better
understood by remarking that the minimum values of t(L×L) are
controlled by aftershocks, while the maximum ones by areas of
diffuse seismicity. For this reason the values of t-(L) are close to
one  another  for  L=10–100  km,  while  the  t+(L)  are  subject  to
greater scatter, being in the order t+(100),…, t+(10). As a result
of the normalization, the left boundary t-(L) will be displaced on
the log scale relative to t-(L=100) by the amount

The scatter will be the smaller, the smaller is d (cf. Figs. 3a and

site:  in  order  to surmount  the  large  scatter  in  t+(L)  the  relative
shift δ must be substantial, i.e., large d should be used (cf. Figs.
3a and 3b).

The  parameter  d  is  thus  an  important  one  in  statements
concerning  the universality  of  the  left/right  tails  in  the  waiting
time distribution (see Davidsen and Goltz, 2004; Corral, 2003).

6. The Distribution of t(L×L) for Small Values.

The  work  of  Bak  et  al.  (2002)  has  drawn  attention  to  the
question  of  how  the  distribution  of  waiting  time  behaves  for
small values of t (see, e.g.,  Corral (2003),  Davidsen  and  Goltz
(2004),  Molchan  (2005)).  The  question  has  proved  to  be
difficult and requires some discussion.

If  an  L×L  square  has  been  fixed,  then  for  a  wide  class  of
models the probability density of t(L×L) mimics the Omori law
for  small  t  (see  the  rigorous  result  by  Molchan  (2005)).  It  is
doubtful  whether  that  result  can  be  transferred  to  the  statistic
)1(
, since there will be two small parameters then, t and L, so
Lt
that  the  result  may  be  affected  by  the  order  of  the  limiting
processes. To corroborate this, let us consider the case where an
L×L cell is narrowed to become a point g. This narrowing of the
cell  diminishes  the  flow  of  events  around  g.  When  the  events
are not strongly correlated over time, the diminishing flow must
be nearly poissonian. Examples like this one can be found in the
book of Daley and Vere-Jones (2003). This intuitive considera-
tion is proved rigorously in the Appendix for the simplest model
which  involves  main  events,  aftershocks  and  the  Omori  law.
The chief inference consists in the relation
   P(t(L×L) λ(L×L)>t) ≅ exp (-t),  L<<1.

   (17)

Some  extra  requirements  are  to  be  imposed  in  order  to  make
(17) uniform over t. In that case we are in the situation conside-
red  in  the  example  of  Section  4.  When  (17)  holds  exactly,  we
have found the limiting distribution of the normalized

pointed out the conditions under which the p.d.f. of 
 has a
power-law  singularity  at  zero.  The  exponent  of  this  power
asymptotic  is  not  universal  (see  an  opposite  opinion  in
(Davidsen and Goltz, 2004)). The statistical difficulties inherent
in  the  analysis  of  small/large  deviations  and  the  potential
dependence of the answer on the order of the limiting processes
in t and L constitute the main sources of contradictory assertions
as to the tails of the distribution of

7. Discussion and Conclusion.

The  main  motive  of  this  study  is  to  try  to  understand  the
nontriviality  of  the  information  provided  by  the  new  scaling
laws  for  seismicity,in  particular  by  the  unified  law  for  waiting
time  t(L×L) of  an  event  in  an  L×L  cell  suggested  by  Bak  et  al
(2002).

The prerequisites of the law are nothing out of the ordinary,

including as they do the following:
  –  the  relation  E t(L×L)  = 1/λ(L×L)  which  holds  for  stationary
seismicity  and  the  scaling  λ(L×L) ∝ Ld  which  is  valid  for  a
monofractal;
  –  limit  theorems  for  classical  seismicity  models  that  incorpo-
rate main shocks, aftershocks and the Omori law; the theoretical
results  show  that  the  distribution  of  t(L×L)Ld  when  w(p)-
averaged  has  a  nontrivial  limit  as  L→0.  This  ensures  that  the
( p
)
  are  close  to  one  another  for
normalized  distributions  of 
Lt
small L;

( p
Lt
( p
)
Lt

  –  the  methods  employed  to  visualize  potentially  close
distributions, namely, (1) the use of a log-log representation for
the density in which attention focuses on the asymptotics of the
tails and (2) scaling of t(L×L) with a suitable parameter d. This
allows  shifting  the  distributions  on  the  log  scale  differently  so
that  one  of  the  tails  collapses,  thus  giving  an  illusion  of  being
independent of L.

Also, there are serious obstacles in the way of a unified law

for waiting time:
  –  the  law  when  understood  rigorously  does  not  exist  for
spatially heterogeneous seismicity (Molchan, 2005);
  –  the  multifractality  of  seismicity  is  incompatible  with  the
scaling of t(L×L) by using a single index of singularity d;
  – the law involves an averaging using weights proportional to
[λ(L×L)]p with p=1; the exceptional role of the parameter p=1 is
by no means clear;
  –  when  the  distribution  density  of  waiting  time  is  viewed  on
the  ordinary scale  (on  the  y-axis),  one  notices  the  influence  of
the scales below and above 40 km, as well as the role of clusters
of events. The latter circumstance is felt when passing from the
weights with p=1 to those with p=2.

The  hierarchical  Bak  method  of  analysis  of  waiting  time
leads to dismissal of aftershocks (Bak et al, 2002). This impor-
tant conclusion requires a different method of corroboration due
to the difficulties described.

It  is  more  productive  to  ask  about  the  optimal/admissible
spatial  scaling  of  waiting  time.  We  have  established  a  relation
between  that  problem  and  the  multifractal  characteristics  of
seismicity.  The  spatial  scaling  index  df  is  rigidly  related  to  the
type  of  averaging  over  the  cells  (see  (12)).  Empirical  analysis
corroborates the theoretical selection of df. This circumstance is
important, since the ideas of multifractality for seismicity have
not  yet  settled  down;  evaluation  of  the  leading  characteristic
τ(p) is stated for unjustifiably long ranges, both of the parameter
p and scale L, which is detrimental to the confidence one might
otherwise  have  placed  in  them.  A  constructive  use  of τ(p)  to
predict the scaling index of waiting times is an independent test
of multifractality and argues in its favor.

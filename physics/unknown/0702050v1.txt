Abstract:  We  suggest  a  way  to  manipulate  electromagnetic  wave  by  introducing  a  rotation 
mapping  of  coordinates  that  can  be  realized  by  a  specific  transformation  of  permittivity  and 
permeability  of  a  shell  surrounding  an  enclosed  domain.  Inside  the  enclosed  domain,  the 
information from outside will appear as if it comes from a different angle. Numerical simulations 
were performed to illustrate these properties.

Pendry et al. [1] have suggested an interesting idea of using the coordinate transformation 
approach to design a cloak of invisibility, enabled by mapping the coordinate transformation to 
electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability which are both spatially varying and anisotropic. 
The coordinate transformation squeezes space from a volume into a shell surrounding the 
concealment volume so that the electromagnetic field is excluded from the concealment volume 
without perturbing the exterior fields. D. Schurig et al. [2] verified this idea by calculating the 
material properties associated with the coordinate transformation and using the results to complete 
the ray tracing. A full-wave simulation of the circle cylinder cloaking structure with TE 
polarization was then performed [3] to see these phenomena more visually. A simpler model was 
experimentally realized later [4]. Recently an optical cloaking device with TM polarization was 
also proposed [5]. The transformation media concept is drawing much attention as it opens up new 
possibilities to control the electromagnetic fields [6-8]. Other devices such as the concentrators 
would be the potential applications of the transformation media as well [9]. 
In  this  paper  we  focus  on  one  kind  of  2D  transformation  media  which  we  would  call  “rotation 
coating (RC)”. We note that for the cloaking proposed by Pendry, the mapping is from a point to a 
circle;  while  for  the  concentrator,  the  mapping  is  from  a  circle  to  another  circle.  The  rotation 
coating  performs  a  rotation  of  wave  fronts  and  we  will  define  the  mapping  and  explore  the 
physical consequence of this kind of transformation media. We limit ourselves to 2D. 
We  start  from  the  basic  transformation  media  theory.  Suppose  that  the  Jacobian  transformation 
matrix between the transformed coordinate and the original coordinate is [7] [10]: 

The associated permittivity and permeability tensors of transformation media become:

Here,

As  an  illustration,  we  set 

  as  an  example.  Fig.  2a  shows  the  numerical  results  for  the

magnetic-field  distribution  and  electromagnetic  power-flow  lines.  We  see  that  the  plane  wave 

changes  its  direction  for

and  outside  the  rotation  coating  flows  in  opposite  directions.  It  is  interesting  that  we  find  some 
turbulence-like  pattern  in  the  coating  region.  Fig.  2b  shows  the  extreme  case  when  we  take 
a ﬁ
.  The  incoming  plane  wave  splits  into  two  set.  Inside  the  rotation  coating,  one  set  has 
initially  a  faster  phase  velocity  then  slow  down,  while  the  other  set  has  initially  a  slower  phase 

0

velocity then speed up. If we set 

0

q   to be very large, we will find each set of rays going around 

the origin for many times. In addition, we note that the rotation coating itself is undetectable to a 
far field observer.

, the scatter is rotated from the position in (a) for

/ 2p

 
Next, we put a scatterer in the inside domain and see what would be “seen” in the outside world. 
Firstly,  we  show  a  simple  scattering  problem,  with  no  coating.  A  small  object  (a  half  circular 
cylinder)  with  relative  permittivity  equals  to  5  was  placed  inside  and  the  scattering  pattern  was 

p

shown in Fig.3a. Secondly, the rotation coating with 

  was placed outside the object and 

/ 2p

/ 2p

2
we  rotate  the  scattering  object  around  the  origin  for
.  The  scattering  pattern  is  shown  in 
Fig.3b,  and  in  the  far  field,  the  pattern  is  identical  to  that  shown  in  Fig.3a.  It  means  when  you 
place an object in the form in Fig. 3b inside the rotation coating, an observer in the outside world 
/ 2p-
 
would see a rotated image, as the one in Fig. 3a. The image of the scatter inside is rotated 
from itself around the origin when observed from the outside. Similarly, the image of the scatter 
  from itself around the origin when observed from the inside. Observers 
outside is rotated 
inside  and  outside  the  rotation  coating  can  communicate  with  each  other,  but  the  information  is 
“rotated”. 
An experimental realization of the rotation coating requires building blocks that have anisotropic 
dielectric  functions.  Such  materials  can  in  principle  be  assembled  from  frequency  selective 
surfaces (FSS) [12]. The similar theory of this kind of rotation mapping could be extended to 3D.   
In conclusion, we have shown a new kind of transformation media which rotates the information 
for a fixed angle, so that observers inside/outside the rotation coating would see a rotated world 
with respect to each other.

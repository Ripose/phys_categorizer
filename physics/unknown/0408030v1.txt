We address the dynamics of higher-order solitons in optical lattices, and predict their 

self-splitting into the set of their single-soliton constituents. The splitting is induced 

by  the  potential  introduced  by  the  lattice,  together  with  the  imprinting  of  a  phase 

tilt  onto  the  initial  multisoliton  states.  The  phenomenon  allows  the  controllable 

generation of several coherent solitons linked via their Zakharov-Shabat eigenvalues. 

Application  of  the  scheme  to  the  generation  of  correlated  matter  waves  in  Bose-

Einstein condensates is discussed.

During the last decades the concept of soliton has penetrated almost all areas 

of  physics  including  hydrodynamics,  plasma  physics,  optics  [1],  and,  recently,  Bose-

Einstein condensates (BECs) in cold gases [2,3]. Solitons are formed when the linear 

effects that cause spreading of wave packets are balanced properly by nonlinearity. In 

the case of single solitons, such balance is remarkably robust, a property that makes 

them  suitable  for  the  transmission  and  manipulation  of,  e.g.,  light  and  matter.  In 

particular,  optical  solitons  have  been  thoroughly  studied  due  to  their  potential 

applications  in  telecommunications.  In  soliton-based  communication  systems  each 

soliton can be used as a bit of information, but methods to encode and to manipulate

information  in  higher-order,  or  multisoliton  bound  states  (BSs)  have  been  also 

proposed, e.g., for security enhanced information transmission [4]. In physical systems 

modeled  by  so-called  completely  integrable  evolution  equations,  such  multisoliton 

states are made of sets of several individual solitons, with different amplitudes, glued 

together with zero binding energy. The amplitudes of the solitons “hidden” inside the 

BS  are  given  by  the  corresponding  Zakharov-Shabat  (ZS)  eigenvalues  [1,4].  Because 

there  is  no  binding  energy  between  the  solitons  forming  the  BSs,  suitable 

perturbations can be used to split them into their constituents [5]. 

In  this  Letter  we  propose  to  use  weak  optical  lattices  to  induce  the  self-

splitting of BSs made of either optical or mater waves, and thereafter to control the 

velocities of the product single solitons. The optical lattices – periodic light patterns 

that act like multiple potential wells – has been demonstrated in nonlinear optics [6-

8]  and  in  BECs  [9].  They  can  be  also  used  for  particle  sorting  [10]  or  for  trapping 

arrays of neutral atoms [11]. Solitons in lattices have been studied extensively in the 

discrete,  or  tight-binding  limit,  in  nonlinear  optics  (see  [12])  and  are  starting  to  be 

investigated  in  BECs  [13,14].  An  important  feature  of  the  condensates  is  the 

possibility  to  continuously  tune  their  nonlinearity,  which  is  proportional  to  the 

scattering  length  a   that  characterizes  two-body  interactions,  by  using  Feschbach 

s

resonances [15]. With this technique the concept we put forward here can be tested in 

condensates. 

The generic equation describing the evolution of optical (matter) wave packets 

in  the  presence  of  Kerr  (mean  field  cubic)  nonlinearity  and  a  periodic  potential 

induced by a weak optical lattice is the nonlinear Schrödinger equation:

We  aim  at  the  possibility  of  extracting  and  controlling  the  dynamics  of  the 

single-soliton  constituents  of  the  N -soliton  bound  state  corresponding  to  the  initial

initial  shape  upon  propagation.  In  the  context  of  optical  solitons  different  types  of 

perturbations,  such  as  third-order  group-velocity  dispersion,  stimulated  Raman 

scattering,  two  photon  absorption,  cascading,  or  asymmetric  spectral  filtering,  are 

known  to  lead  to  the  splitting  of  the  BSs  into  the  constituent  solitons,  so  the  ZS 

eigenvalues can be extracted BS [5]. The method we put forward here, based on the 

 

3

use  of  an  optical  lattice,  is  extremely  robust  and  controllable.  We  show  that  the 

splitting can be controlled by acting on two external parameters, namely a phase tilt 

imposed on the BS and, more importantly, the lattice strength. 

In Fig. 1 we show a few representative examples of the typical decay of three-

soliton bound states induced by the periodic potential produced by the optical lattice. 

The plots have been obtained for the weak potential 

p =

0.05

. As shown in Fig. 1(a) 

and  1(b),  for  small  values  of 

p

  and  small  incident  angles  α   only  the  soliton  with 

in

highest  energy  is  trapped  inside  the  central  waveguide  created  by  the  lattice  sites, 

whereas  the  other  ones  move  across  the  periodic  potential  at  constant  angles.  We 

found that the trapping occurs only when the initial tilt is below a critical value. For 

single solitons, the value of the critical tilt can be estimated analytically, to find [6,8]

This estimate was found to agree very well with the numerical values (e.g., up to the 

4th digit for  χ

5=

, 

p =

0.05

). Importantly, for weak lattices the amplitudes 

kχ

 of 

the  output  solitons  arising  after  the  splitting  were  always  found  to  almost  coincide 

with  the  initial  values  hidden  inside  the  BS.  When  the  outgoing  solitons  propagate 

across the lattice, their amplitudes decrease slowly because of the soliton interaction 

and crossing of the corresponding periodic potential. Detailed estimates of such small 

radiation  are  given  in  Refs.  [6].  Physically,  the  splitting  is  caused  by  the  different 

phase-shifts acquired by the several solitons contained in the unperturbed BS through 

their  different  scattering  by  the  lattice  and,  more  importantly,  by  their  mutual 

nonlinear  interactions.  In  the  early  stages  of  the  evolution  (

ξ ∼

1)

,  the  tilted  three-

soliton BS starts a self-compression, followed by reshaping into a twin-peak structure. 

Asymmetrical energy tunnelling to the neighbouring lattice sites finally leads to the 

splitting and soliton escaping. Complex interactions between the solitons may lead to 

repulsion, hence solitons bounce back against the initial tilt, as visible in Fig. 1. 

 

Fig. 1 shows that the escape angles of the solitons can be effectively controlled 

by varying the tilt 

. To further explore this point we plotted in Fig. 2 the escape 

inα
  versus  the  initial  tilt 

angles 

kα

inα

  for  two-  and  three-soliton  BSs.  The  critical  tilt 

beyond  which  the  highest  energy  soliton  escapes  from  the  central  potential  well  is 

close to 0.4 for  N

=

2

 and 0.45 for  N

3=

. Large tilts make solitons moving closer to 

each other whereas small ones correspond to an ideal regime for soliton switching and

steering.  Importantly,  we  found  that  the  splitting  process  is  not  sensitive  against 

variations  in  the  lattice  strength  or  against  small  random  noise  present  in  the 

complex profile of the input BS (see Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)). This result claims for the 

remarkable  robustness  of  the  eigenvalue  control  process  afforded  by  the  lattice,  as 

well as for the feasibility of its experimental observation. 

Another important possibility opened by the lattice is tuning its strength, thus 

a new control parameter to the toolkit aimed at controlling the soliton splitting. This 

possibility is illustrated in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b), which show the splitting of BSs at 

fixed initial tilt by varying the lattice strength. As one can see from the plots, large 

variations  of  the  potential  depth  do  not  lead  to  qualitative  changes  in  the  splitting 

dynamics. Fig. 3(c) summarizes the point: The escape angles of the solitons generated 

through the splitting growth smoothly with the lattice strength. It is remarkable that 

trajectories of escaping solitons remain almost linear up to rather high values of the 

potential depth 

p ∼

0.3

. 

As it is clear from the previous discussion, on one hand the periodic potential 

induces the break-up of the BSs into its constituents. However, on the other hand it 

also  provides  a  potential  barrier  for  each  soliton.  Therefore,  when  such  a  potential 

barrier is high enough it might lead to trapping of the generated single solitons into a 

specific  channel  of  the  lattice,  thus  providing  a  method  to  harvest  the  product 

solitons  for  further  manipulation.  To  explore  this  phenomenon  quantitatively,  let  a 

soliton be trapped in the n -th lattice channel when the coordinate 

mη

maxima  satisfies  nT

.  In  Fig.  4  we  present  the 

m

outcome of an illustrative simulation for two different BS decay scenarios in the deep 

potential 

p ∼

1

. In this regime, the decay of BS and the subsequent propagation of 

the  produced  single  solitons  are  accompanied  by  the  generation  of  radiation.  The 

generated  solitons  might  be  trapped  in  different  lattice  channels  depending  on  the 

value  of  the  initial  tilt.  However,  in  this regime the process is highly inelastic, thus 

the  amplitudes  of  the  output  solitons  may  depart  considerably  from  the  values 

k

χ = −

  carried  by  the  input  BS.  As  in  the  case  of  small  potential  depth,  the 

k

soliton with the highest energy can no longer be trapped in the central channel when 

incident angle exceeds a threshold value. Naturally, large tilts lead to large radiative 

losses that affect drastically the soliton amplitudes and make the trapping impossible. 

Also, for deep enough potentials the annihilation or birth of new solitons might occur. 

Radiative losses grow dramatically when the tilt angle approaches the Bragg one, so 

resonances  with  spectral  bands  become  important  [6].  However  such  angles  fall  far 

 

5

above  those  considered  here.  A  detailed  description  of  the  Bragg  scattering  of 

wavepackets  in  periodic  potentials  in  linear  and  nonlinear  regimes  can  be  found  in 

Ref.  [17],  where  it  is  shown  that  scattering  occurs  in  accordance  with  the 

contributions  of  different  Bloch  states  into  the  spectrum  of  the  wavepacket.  The 

approach of Ref. [17] can potentially be applied to scattering of BSs since those can 

be viewed as nonlinear combination of several single solitons (wavepackets). 

A  central  motivation  of  this  paper  is  the  implementation  of  the  proposed 

scheme  in  one-dimensional  Bose-Einstein  condensates  hold  in  optical  lattices,  thus 

next  we  discuss  the  feasibility  of  the  method  with  currently  available  technology. 

Creation of a multi-soliton bound state can be achieved in the following way. First, a 

single  standing  bright  soliton  condensate  has  to  be  created  in  the  absence  of  the 

optical  lattice.  Such  soliton  corresponds  to  the  ground  state  of  the  system  for  a 

certain (negative) value of the scattering length. For instance, for a scattering length 

such  that  γ

= −

1/ 4

  the  profile  of  such  soliton  is  given  by 

Ψ =
( )
η

η
2 sech( )

.  By 

changing then the scattering length to 

γ = −

1

 with the aid of Feschbach resonances, 

( )ηΨ

  becomes  a  bound  state  of  two  solitons.  The  optical  lattice  is  then  grown  up 

adiabatically. Using a phase-imprinting technique [18], or by tilting the optical lattice 

in  the  gravitational  field,  one  can  imprint  onto  the  condensate  wave  function  the 

desired linear phase. All these steps are currently standard experimental techniques. 

Notice that the creation of higher-order solitons in BECs is discussed also in Ref [19]. 

To summarize, we have proposed a mechanism for the extraction and control 

of  the  multiple  single  solitons  carried  by  higher-amplitude  initial  conditions  in 

systems  modelled  by  the  nonlinear  Schrödinger  equations  with  external  linear 

periodic  potentials.  We  discussed  the  physical  implementation  of  the  technique  in 

optical  Kerr  media  and  in  Bose-Einstein  condensates  hold  in  optical  lattices.  For 

weak lattices, we showed that the lattice strength and a phase tilt imprinted to the 

initial  conditions  enable  extraction  of  all  the  ZS  eigenvalues  carried  by  the  input 

conditions.  Such  splitting  process  being  coherent,  it  leads  to  the  generation  of 

quantum correlated matter waves, a feature that might find applications in the area 

of macroscopic coherent atomic ensembles [20].

1. ABSTRACT 
 

A  photogrammetric  method  of  stress  analysis  has  been  developed  to  test  thin,  nonstandard 
windows designed for hydrogen absorbers, major components of a muon cooling channel.  The 
purpose of the absorber window tests is to demonstrate an understanding of the window behavior 
and strength as a function of applied pressure.  This is done by comparing the deformation of the 
window, measured via photogrammetry, to the deformation predicted by finite element analysis 
(FEA).    FEA  analyses  indicate  a  strong  sensitivity  of  strain  to  the  window  thickness.  
Photogrammetric methods were chosen to measure the thickness of the window, thus providing 
data that are more accurate to the FEA.  This, plus improvements made in hardware and testing 
procedures, resulted in a precision of 5 microns in all dimensions and substantial agreement with FEA 
predictions. 

 
 

2. INTRODUCTION 
 

Muon accelerators are being considered to extend the energy reach of high energy physics.  
Present approaches using hadron and electron colliders are reaching critical size and performance 
constraints.    Hadron  colliders  are  performance-constrained  in  that  complicated  many-particle 
collisions  with  a  rapidly  diminishing  fraction  (in  numbers  and  energy)  of  the  interactions  in 
point-like  new  particle-state-production  is  produced. 
  Lepton  colliders  produce  simple 
interactions,  and  this  magnifies  the  effective  energy  of  collisions  by  more  than  an  order  of 
magnitude  over  hadron  colliders.    Extension  of  e+e-  colliders  to  multi-Tev  energies  is 
constrained by 'beamstrahlung' (Appendix A) and synchrotron radiation effects, which increase 
.  Muons, however, have negligible radiation and 'beamstrahlung' [1].

 and that they are 

created through decay into a diffuse phase space.  The phase space can be reduced by ionization 
cooling,  and  the  lifetime  is  sufficient  for  storage  ring  collisions.    In  ionization  cooling,  muons 
lose  energy  through  ionization  interactions  while  passing  through  material  (referred  to  as 
absorber),  losing  both  longitudinal  and  transverse  momentum,  and  are  reaccelerated,  regaining 
only  longitudinal  momentum.    The  loss  of  transverse  momentum  reduces  particle  emittances, 
cooling the beam.  However, the random process of multiple scattering in the material increases 

the RMS of the beam divergence, adding a heating term, which must be controlled in the cooling 
design [1]. 

 
The  choice  of  absorber  material  is  driven  by  a  tradeoff  between  energy  loss  and  multiple 
2Z , 
scattering  in  the  material.    Energy  loss  depends  on  Z/A,  while  scattering  is  a  function  of 
indicating  the  best  choice  of  material  is  hydrogen.    Similarly,  the  container  for  the  hydrogen 
should be made from a low-Z material.  Beryllium would be optimal, but due to the toxic effects 
of beryllium, aluminum has been chosen.  The container is a cylindrical vessel axially symmetric 
with the beam.  The end-caps (referred to as windows) are designed to minimize thickness in the 
central region as dictated by the expected beam size (to minimize scattering) while maintaining 
strength.  Current neutrino factory designs aim at cooling the beam from ~3cm rms radius (~10 
cm full size) to ~1cm rms radius over the full cooling channel, and possibly by another factor of 
3 (to ~3mm rms or a bit less) for a collider scenario [1].   

 
Safety concerns associated with hydrogen make it necessary to understand the strength of the 
windows.    Historically  hydrogen  has  been  used  in  high  energy  physics  experiments,  but  the 
application  to  muon  cooling  presents  new  challenges.    The  energy  deposition  in  the  hydrogen 
absorber will be much greater and the volume much smaller than in hydrogen bubble chambers 
and other fixed targets.   

 
Therefore,  a  clear  understanding  of  the  window  behavior  and  strength  as  a  function  of 
applied pressure is required.  This has been demonstrated by comparing the deformation of the 
window  as  measured  via  photogrammetry  to  that  predicted  by  FEA.    Photogrammetry  is  a  3-
dimensional coordinate measuring technique that uses photographic images as the fundamental 
medium for metrology.    

  
Since  FEA  analyses  indicate  a  strong  sensitivity  of  strain  to  the  window  thickness, 
photogrammetric  methods  have  also  been  used  to  measure  the  thickness  of  the  window, 
providing more accurate input to the FEA.  These measurements have also been compared to the 
design, providing a method of quality control.

3. BRIEF HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY 
 

The  earliest  roots  of  photogrammetry  can  be  traced  to  Renaissance  painters,  particularly 
Leonardo da Vinci, who studied the principles involved in the geometric analysis of pictures in 
the  late  1400s.    The  next  significant  development  was  projective  geometry,  which  forms  the 
mathematical basis of photogrammetry.  Notables include Desargues, Pascal, and Lambert, from 
the  mid-1600s  to  mid-1700s.    The  actual  practice  of  photogrammetry  could  not  occur  until 
Daguerre's invention of photography in 1839.  A year after Daguerre's invention, using kites and 
balloons for taking aerial photographs, Colonel Aime Laussedat of the French Army directed the 
first  experiments  using  photogrammetry  for  topographic  mapping.  Laussedat  is  considered  the 
"father of photogrammetry".  The invention of the airplane in 1903 facilitated the emergence of 
modern  aerial  photogrammetry.    Advancements  in  instrumentation  and  techniques  continued 
through the last century [2,3].   

4. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN PHOTOGRAMMETRY 
 

Three pieces of equipment are required for photogrammetry: camera, targets, and software.  
Many  recent  developments  in  each  of  these  areas  were  used  to  develop  methods  of  photo-
grammetric stress analysis and quality control. 

4.1 Digital imaging 
  

Digital  photographs  have  replaced  emulsion-based  photographs  for  all  but  the  most  exotic 
applications.    Due  to  advances  in  digital  image  processing  software,  coded  targets,  and  auto-
correlation  methods,  a  large  number  of  photogrammetric  measurement  tasks  can  now  be  fully 
automated [4].  A camera and software system known as V-STARS (Video Stereo Triangulation 
and Resection Software), from Geodetic Services, Inc. (GSI) was used.  V-STARS uses a high-
resolution CCD camera to perform digital photogrammetry.  

4.2 Self-identifying objects 

 
The use of self-identifying coded targets and an artifact known as an Autobar automate the 
process  (Figure  1).    The  coded  targets  contain  seven  square  features  that  are  placed  in  a  two-
dimensional array, thereby providing a set of unique patterns that is recognized by the scanning 
software, along with a central circular feature that represents the target’s position.  The Autobar, 
shaped like a cross, has six features arranged in a three-dimensional pattern that is recognized by 
the scanning software.  The Autobar acts as a self-identifying reference frame indicator, so that 
the initial approximations of the object coordinates can be established.  In the final stages of the 
processing, this initial reference frame is generally transformed to a location that better suits the 
geometry of the object and its analysis.  The origin is transformed from the Autobar to the center 
of the window so that the window flange defines the XY plane and the convex side is in the +Z 
direction (Figure. 2)

4.3 Intelligent camera 
 
4.3.1 Hardware 

 
Hardware  development  has  come  in  the  form  of  the  "intelligent  camera".    The  intelligent 
camera  contains  an  integrated  computer  and  processes  the  image  immediately  after  it  is  taken, 
providing information about the image so that errors, such as poor exposure, insufficient number 
of coded targets or missing Autobar, disk full, and lens cap on, may be detected and diagnosed 
during  data  acquisition  [4].    The  camera  used  is  a  GSI  INCA  (INtelligent  CAmera)  with  an 
image  size  of  18.4x27.6mm,  2044x3072  pixels,  fixed  focal  length  of  17mm,  and  a 
°76  
field of view.  The lens focus is fixed such that the useful depth of field is 0.5m to 30m.

4.3.2 Hardware precision 

 

 

Measurement precision is a function of the resolution and quality of the camera, the size of 
the  object  being  measured,  the  number  of  photographs  taken,  the  geometric  layout  of  the 
pictures, and the correctness of the camera calibration.  According to GSI, the camera system and 
software  can  produce  a  centroid  determination  on  the  order  of  1/50  of  a  pixel  by  using  an 
intensity-weighted  analysis  of  the  target.    This  value  is  based  on  using  a  single  image  from  a 
handheld camera, using permanent targets rather than using a projector (see 4.5.1), with a target 
size of at least 3-pixels by 3-pixels.  By examining the details of the design, it is apparent that 
this is a reasonably conservative assessment of the system resolution.  As such, it leaves room for 
those  interested  in  extracting  measurements  that  are  more  precise  an  opportunity  to  do  so.  
Considering the 3072 pixel  (2044) width (height), which measures 27.6mm (18.4), a single pixel 
measures 9µm square.   

 

4

 
At first glance, 9µm would seem to be the lower limit of resolution, however, this is not the 
case.  The following example illustrates this point.  Each pixel has an 8-bit range of sensitivity to 
incident light, which gives an output range of 0 to 255.  If a beam of light fills the entire area of a 
single  pixel  with  sufficient  brightness  to  achieve  an  output  of  255,  but  without  entering  into 
saturation, and all adjacent pixels have an output of 0, the center of the beam can be said to be at 
the center of the pixel.  If the beam is translated such that one of the adjacent pixels has an output 
of 1 (the other seven adjacent pixels remaining at 0 output), the original pixel will have an output 
of  254.    The  translation  required  to  achieve  this  state  is  1/256  of  the  width  of  the  pixel  (9µm 
/256),  or  0.035µm.    This  value  can  be  considered  the  fundamental  positional  resolution  of  the 
CCD, at least when intensity weighting is used for position determination.  In practice, the value 
will be subject to ambient light conditions, and near saturation levels, which should be avoided.  
However,  filtering  techniques  and  exposure  settings,  along  with  ambient  light  control,  can  be 
used to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby recovering most of the theoretical resolution. 

4.3.3 Operational factors 

 
Actual targets are much larger than the minimum 3-pixel by 3-pixel size for several reasons, 
primary of which is to improve the centroid determination, but also to filter unwanted spurious 
pixels  which  may  have  been  illuminated  by  bright,  non-target  objects,  such  as  the  heads  of 
screws, circuit board pins, etc.  In addition to pixel count, shape of the pixel patch is an important 
filtering  criterion  in  order  to  reject  false  targets.    The  algorithm  that  GSI  uses  for  centroid 
determination,  as  stated  above,  is  based  upon  the  intensity  weighting  approach  but  is 
implemented with some additional, proprietary features. 

Without  detailing  the  simulation  process  used  to  validate  the  centroid  determination 
algorithm,  it  is  fair  to  say  that  the  centroid  of  a  larger  patch  of  pixels  is  likely  to  be  better 
determined  than  a  smaller  patch  of  pixels.    For  our  purposes,  a  target  pixel  count  of 
approximately  50  was  sought.    In  practice,  as  it  applies  to  this  effort,  pixel  count  usually 
exceeded 50 and approached 100 from the closer camera stations.  What the optimum size of a 
target  is,  as  it  relates  to  the  centroid  determination,  will  be  left  to  the  Monte  Carlo  experts.  
Certainly,  counts  above  100  pixels,  as  it  applies  to  this  system,  seem  to  offer  little  or  no 
advantage. 

 
The  functional  resolution  of  the  camera,  that  is  the  resolution  a  camera  may  achieve  as  a 
system, can be determined by creating a field of targets, fixing the camera with respect to that 
field, then taking repeated images of the targets.  The X-Y coordinates of the centroid of each 
target in the image plane should remain constant at the level of functional resolution.  As will be 
detailed later in this paper, this examination is complicated by the inclusion of the projector.

The following items contribute to the precision of a photogrammetric solution: 

•  Resolution of the camera  
•  Structural integrity of the camera (whether the CCD moves with respect to the focal 

point of the lens) 

•  Dimensional  uniformity  (does  the  camera  “grow”  detrimentally  in  response  to  the 

heat generated by the on-board computer, for example) 

•  Correctness of the camera calibration 
•  Other, more subtle, factors which may or may not be known 
•  Stability of the scene 
•  Geometry of the camera positions relative to the object  
•  Number of exposures 
•  Object-space size 

4.3.4 Measurement precision 

 
The  precision  of  a  piece  of  work,  that  is  the  precision  of  the  system  as  it  is  applied  to  the 
project  at  hand,  is  governed  first  by  the  requirements  of  the  end  user.    In  this  case,  with  a 
predicted maximum deflection of about 2mm, a precision of 10µm in the direction of deflection 
(+Z direction) would be sufficient, but with the objective of improving positional precision in the 
X-Y direction by refinement of method. 

 
An  examination  of  the  size  of  the  object,  the  available  geometrically  suitable  camera 
locations,  and  the  practical  working  distance  from  the  camera  to  the  object,  dictated  that  the 
distance from camera to the object would be in the range of 0.7m to 1.2m or, nominally 1.0m.  
Considering  the  17mm  lens  of  the  camera,  a  magnification  ratio  of  approximately  60,  ((1.0 
+0.017)/0.017)  is  realized.    Multiplying  this  value  by  the  fundamental  resolution  (0.035µm) 
yields a lower limit of working resolution of 2µm. 

4.4 Refinement of method 

 

Initial efforts indicated that surface deformation was being measured with a precision of 8 to 
15µm, which were determined from between 50–60 images (precision of the components of the 
target  position  are  determined  as  part  of  the  V-STARS  bundle  adjustment.)    While  the  results 
were at a nearly acceptable level, the transverse components were larger than expected, as high 
as  0.2mm,  and  quite  irregular.    While  examining  the  causes  of  this  issue,  a  number  of 
opportunities  were  discovered  that  would  allow  for  an  improvement  in  overall  precision.    The 
culprit in these early efforts was the mounting method for the projector on the optical bench.  

 
By careful refinement of the procedures used, along with some of the system components, a 
precision in the range of 3.5 to 5µm has been achieved.  This was done primarily by stabilizing 
the  components  of  the  system,  examining  the  medium  term  (several  hours)  stability  of  the 
camera and projector, and developing optimum geometry for the camera locations.

The  stability  test  was  done  by  taking  a  series  of  close  range  (0.5m)  images  of  the  target 
pattern  (about  5mm  diameter),  as  projected  onto  a  coated  aluminum  sheet,  over  a  period  of 
several hours in parts of two days, at ten-minute intervals.  The aluminum sheet was affixed to a 
granite table, as was the projector, while the camera was mounted on its standard tripod.  A cable 
release  was  used  to  isolate  the  camera  from  the  observer.    The  first  image  was  used  as  a 
reference, with each successive image being compared to it.   

 
Approximately 2,000 targets were analyzed for each image.  While a shift was noted between 
the  two  days  of  about  1.5µm  in  X  and  Y  in  the  image  plane,  the  internal  consistency  of  each 
several-hour session was in the range of 0.1-0.4µm in X and Y.  This procedure examines the 
effective stability of the camera and the projector as a single system.  As the numbers suggest, 
our stabilization effort was successful. 

As for geometry, the goal was to take as few images as possible during each pressure epoch.  
A  rule  of  thumb  offered  by  GSI  states  that  a  minimum  of  twelve  well  distributed  camera 
positions would be sufficient to ensure optimal results.  Since the most useful indicator of stress 
from a metrology point of view is displacement in the Z direction, a bias in the camera positions 
was  sought  in  order  to  enhance  the  parallactic  angle.    This  was  done  by  exaggerating  the  air-
base, the separation between camera stations in the X and Y directions. 

 

4.5.1 Projected targets 

 
One limiting factor that has affected the acceptance of photogrammetry in general is the need 
for  point-of-interest  targeting  [4].    If  the  object  is  fragile,  it  may  be  undesirable  to  touch  the 
object  to  apply  standard  retro-reflective  targets,  and  if  the  area  or  desired  density  of  target 
coverage is large, it may be very time consuming to adequately cover the area.  Hence, the focus 
of  recent  developments  has  been  to  eliminate  the  necessity  to  physically  target  the  measured 
object.    Since  the  absorber  window  is  very  thin  (~330um  at  the  center)  and  very  complete 
coverage of the area was desired, a non-contact targeting method was attractive.   

A  new,  non-contact  targeting  technique  that  employs  a  high-power  stroboscopic  projector, 
GSI's PRO-SPOT, to project a pattern of dots (targets) onto a surface, was selected (Figures 2 
and  3).    The  dots  are  of  high  contrast  and  quality,  mimicking  conventional  retro-reflective 
targets, but have no inherent thickness.  This feature is especially attractive when the technique is 
applied  to  measuring  the  window  dimensions  for  quality  control.    The  results  can  be  directly 
compared to design without any compensation for target thickness.  Although a thin layer of a 
flat-white  coating  was  required  to  achieve  high  contrast  on  the  reflective  aluminum  surface,  it 
was shown that the measured window dimensions were not affected.  In the testing of Window 4, 
an  effort  was  made  to  measure  the  thickness  of  the  material  by  measuring  both  faces  of  the 
window.  First, measurements were made with the standard coating procedure, followed then by 
a measurement set using an extremely light ‘dusting’ of the coating material.  The comparison of 
the  two  sets  of  measurements  yielded  a  difference  of  3.6µm  for  the  flange  thickness,  as 
determined  by  calculating  the  best-fit  planes  from  approximately  200  targets  on  each  surface.  

 

7

While  the  flange  measurements  where  successful,  the  thinner  coating  caused  contrast 
deficiencies on the spherical surface because of excessive surface reflection from the aluminum.  
This resulted in poor centroid determination and, consequently, poorer error estimates than the 
prior set.  An attempt was made to recoat the surface as in the first case, but poor technique and 
lack of patience caused excessive running of the coating material.  This resulted in an increase in 
apparent thickness of about 30µm.  While the deformation measurements are not sensitive to the 
coating  thickness,  it  is  clear  that  proper  technique  in  applying  the  coating  is  required  for 
thickness measurements. 

 

 

Figure 3 

 

The  principle  of  the  projection  system  is  much  like  an  ordinary  slide  projector.    A  strobed 
light source, triggered by the camera flash (Figure 4) illuminates a target slide.  This illuminated 
pattern passes through a series of lenses that magnify the slide and project it onto the object.  The 
actual  construction  of  the  projector  is  complicated  by  the  need  to  accurately  control  the  whole 
process.  By far, the greatest concern is the stability of the dot pattern.  Instability of the pattern 
is tantamount to moving the object during the measurement [4].  

 
As was mentioned above, there was evidence of projector instability during tests of Window 
1  and  Window  2.    If  the  projection  system  is  stable,  the  coordinates  of  the  targets  that  are 
orthogonal (in the X-Y plane) to the projector should remain constant throughout the test.  The 
instability  was  attributed  to  motion  of  the  projector  and  not  motion  of  the  windows,  by  noting 
that  only  the  coordinates  of  the  projected  targets  changed,  while  the  retro-reflective  targets 
attached to the windows remained constant.  Increased stability was achieved through the design 
of a more stable mount for the projector (Figure 5) and by operating the camera from a tripod 
with a remote trigger.

4.5.2 Target pattern 

 
The  target  pattern is  created  by an  array  of  holes  in  the  slide.    The  slide  provided  with  the 
projector was used for the tests of Window 1 and Window 2.  This slide has a rectangular array 
of 5600 dots, but only 200 of the dots were projected on the window surface at the desired dot 
size.  To sample a larger fraction of the window surface and to better suit the circular geometry 
of the window, a custom slide with a radial pattern was designed which increased coverage by an 
order of magnitude (Figure 6).  The holes in the slide are 0.2mm in diameter on 0.4mm centers.  
With a magnification of about 15, this resulted in 3mm-diameter targets on the window.   

 

 

   
Figure 6

 The  radial  pattern  proved  very  effective  in  tests  of  Window  3  and  Window  4,  providing 
more  data  near  the  center  of  the  window.    This  is  the  location  of  prime  interest  since  it  is  the 
thinnest, weakest region of the window. 
 
5. THE PHOTOGRAMMETRIC PROCESS 
 
5.1.1 Photogrammetric principles 
 

Photogrammetry uses the principle of parallax to determine the coordinates of the object of 
interest.    Parallax  is  the  apparent  shift  in  an  object's  position  when  viewed  alternately  from 
different  vantage  points.    Parallax  is  the  primary  basis  upon  which  our  eyes  gauge  distance 
within our surroundings.  Distance and parallax go hand in hand.  A more distant object has a 
smaller perceived parallax.  

5.1.2 Astronomic analogue 

 
Astronomers use parallax to determine stellar distances by measuring the apparent shift of a 
relatively nearby star against the background of identifiable, more distant stars due to the motion 
of  the  earth  around  the  sun  (Figure  7).    The  angular  distance  between  the  background  stars 
(which  exhibit  negligible  parallax)  provide  a  scale  to  measure  the  shift.    Half  the  baseline  is 
1AU.  This angle is twice the parallax angle, p, and forms a right triangle with the baseline and 
line  of  sight  to  the  star.    Using  the  small  angle  approximation  for  tangent,  the  distance  can  be 
calculated: d=1AU/p.  

 
Figure 7 

 

 

10

 

 

 

Similarly,  photogrammetric  measurements  are  initially  dimensionless.    Dimensions  are 
established by use of one or more scale artifacts, generally of Invar or carbon fiber construction 
(Figure 8). 

 

 
Figure 8 

 

 
Notice that the length of the baseline used in the stellar parallax measurement, the distance 
between the earth and sun, must be known from an independent measurement.  Historically, this 
was  measured  by  observing  the  parallax  of  planets.    The  modern  method  is  to  measure  the 
distance to Venus using radar techniques (Appendix B).   

 

Different  from  stellar  parallax  calculations  for  astronomy,  where  the  baseline  must  be 
determined  by  independent  means  (Figure  9),  in  convergent  terrestrial  photogrammetry  the 
solution  is  based  on  the  principle  of  ray-intersection.    In  this  type  of  photogrammetry,  the 
cameras  do  not  need  to  be,  and  are  generally  not,  located  at  predetermined  positions.    The 
photogrammetric  solution  is  accomplished  by  the  use  of  collinearity  equation  solution  [2],  [3], 
where  a  ray  is  a  line  that  connects  a  point  in  object  space  and  that  object's  image  in  the  CCD 
(image space).  In a perfectly calibrated camera, all rays for a single image pass through the focal 
point  of  the  camera.    If  several  of  the  objects  have  previously  established  coordinates,  the 
position of the focal point in object space (X, Y, Z) and the orientation of the image (roll, pitch, 
yaw, or Ω, φ, κ) can be determined.  This process is known as resection.  Once these parameters 
have been determined from images taken from several different camera locations, the positions 
of  the  unknown  targets  can  be  calculated  by  intersecting  rays  from  these  additional  targets 
(Figure.10).    This  process  is  known  as  triangulation.    The  process  is  repetitive,  in  that  as 
unknown  targets  become  known,  more  images  may  be  resected  and  more  targets  may  be 

 

11

triangulated.  Resection and triangulation are repeated until all the coordinates of all objects in all 
images have been determined.

5.2 System options – single camera vs. multiple camera  

 
As when performing stellar parallax measurements, the photographs do not need to be taken 
simultaneously.  In modern photogrammetry there are two general options for acquiring images: 
1)  multiple  cameras  set  at  various  positions  around  the  area  of  interest,  with  the  images  taken 
simultaneously;  or  2)  a  single  camera  which  is  moved  to  various  positions  around  the  area  of 
interest, with the images taken sequentially.  The choice is whether the volatility of the scene is 
so great that the scene is likely to change significantly in a short period, or whether the highest 
possible precision is required and the scene can be expected to be stable over a reasonably short 
period.  Two issues come into play: 1) camera calibration and 2) the number of rays available to 
make the coordinate calculation. 

 
In a multi-camera system, the calibration of each camera is based upon a previous analysis, 
usually  by  the  manufacturer,  which  may  have  been  done  under  different  conditions  than  those 
present during the subsequent measurement.  In a single-camera system, a process known as self-
calibration is part of the measurement solution.  Self-calibration is a computational process that 
refines the camera's calibration as required by ambient conditions, such as camera temperature.  
By taking many images with the camera in the normal orientation, as well as rolled around its 
principal  axis  (rotated  90  degrees),  sufficient  information  is  available  to  determine  deviations 
from the camera’s nominal calibration. 

 

12

The single-camera system was used, because the highest possible precision was required and 
the scene could be expected to remain stable for the time necessary to acquire twelve images.  Of 
these twelve images, two were taken with the camera rolled 90 degrees (Figure 11).  The time 
required to acquire the twelve images was typically between sixty and seventy seconds.

5.3 Photogrammetric data reduction 

 
Astronomers do not rely on only two snapshots of a star at the extreme ends of the Earth's 
orbit to determine its distance.  As many observations of a target star as possible are recorded.  
The angular shift is incredibly tiny, and it is easily lost in the noise.  Similar to the calibration 
required in photogrammetry, the data must be corrected for effects of earth's atmosphere and for 
imperfections in the telescope optics.  Astronomers want to be convinced that parallax, and only 
parallax, can explain the shift observed [5]. 

 
In  the  same  spirit,  more  than  two  images  are  used  in  photogrammetry.    Twelve-ray 
intersections are typical.  Since as few as two rays can determine a 3D coordinate, the position of 
the object is generally over-determined.  A least squares analysis, known as a bundle adjustment, 
is performed to determine the most probable coordinates for each object, the error estimates, the 
camera's  calibration,  and  estimates  of  precision  for  the  entire  process.    The  intersection  of  the 
twelve rays results in an ellipsoid of uncertainty.  The V-STARS Bundle summary reports the X, 
Y, Z components of this ellipsoid for each measured point (Figure 12).

6. STRESS ANALYSIS VIA PHOTOGRAMMETRY 
 

After  initially  testing  both  strain  gages  and  photogrammetry,  photogrammetry  became  the 
method  of  choice  to  measure  the  behavior  of  the  window  under  varying  amounts  of  stress. 
Photogrammetry was preferable to the more standard strain gages for measuring strain for two 
reasons: 1) Using non-contact targeting for photogrammetry, there is no danger that the tests will 
damage or alter the fragile windows; and 2) the coverage is much more complete. 

 

 

6.1 Initial test design (Window 1 and Window 2) 
 

The  first  two  windows  tested  were  instrumented  with  strain  gages  and  measured  via 
photogrammetry.    The  measured  quantity  in  each  test  is  different.    Strain  gages  measure  the 
tangential elongation of the material, ∆L/L, while photogrammetry measures the deflection in the 
Z direction (the targets are projected orthogonal to the window flange).  Unlike strain gages that 
are glued to the surface, the targets do not exhibit any motion in the X-Y direction in response to 
stress.  Therefore, it is not possible to directly compare the strain gage and photogrammetry data.   

 
However, FEA can simulate both strain and deflection as a function of stress.  If both types 
of measurements agree with the FEA, it may be concluded that both are viable means to measure 
window behavior. 

 

 
Several strain gages were applied along four radial lines separated by 90 degrees (Figure 13).  
Each gage was read out via a Wheatstone bridge with a temperature-compensating gage in the 
parallel leg. 

 
The tests were performed at room temperature with stress applied by pressurized water.     
 
The  point  of  yield  was  consistent  between  evidence  from  both  strain  gages  and  photo-

grammetry.

6.2 Data from new test setup (Window 3 and Window 4) 
 

Figure 13 

As mentioned above, the data from Window 1 and Window 2 inspired improvements in the 
setup  stability  and  photogrammetric  technique.    Hence,  the  bulk  of  the  data  discussed  in  this 
paper will be from Window 3 and Window 4. 

 
The pressure versus yield characteristic, for several radii (in the X-Y plane), can be seen in 
(Figure 14).  The data provide a clear picture of yield at lower pressures for smaller radii, where 
the window was much thinner, while no yield was  seen at larger radii, where the window was 
thicker.

6.3 Comparison to FEA 
 

The FEA includes prediction of the behavior of the window in the linear region to the point 
of  ultimate  yield.    The  deflection  from  zero  applied  pressure  of  the  windows  described  by  the 
coordinates derived from photogrammetry, may be compared to the deflection predicted by FEA 
for each test pressure.  Representative results for Window 3 plotted as “deflection (delta Z) vs. 
pressure”, for increasing radii as shown in (Figures 15a-15f).

Window 4 was tested at liquid nitrogen (LN) temperatures.  The dewar used did not permit 
photogrammetric measurements to be made.  Hence, photogrammetric measurements were made 
at room temperature up to 50psi (well below yield stress), to ensure that material characteristics 

 

18

were  not  changed  prior  to  the  LN  test.    These  measurements  were  compared  to  the  data  from 
Window  3.    The  agreement  between  Window  3  data  and  Window  4  data  (Figure  16a-16c) 
indicates  the  consistency  in  manufacturing  and  the  viability  of  using  photogrammetry  for 
material control for future production runs.  While measurement of the window shape (see 6.5) 
provides information about the geometric conformity to design, it would not reveal information 
about any flaws in the material.  Measuring the window's response to stress is required for this 
test.

6.4 Benefits of extensive area coverage 
 

The  very  extensive  area  coverage  provided  by  photogrammetry  permitted  observation  of  a 
harmonic  effect  (Figure.    17).    This  effect  is  under  investigation.    Several  explanations  for  the 
effect  have  been  offered,  such:  as  an  offset  target  pattern;  window  shape  eccentricity;  actual 
static  harmonic  oscillations  in  the  window;  and,  perhaps,  a  superposition  of  several  effects.  
These effects would not have been visible in the strain gage data.

6.5 Material control (compare to design) 

Photogrammetry  was  also  applied  in  comparing  the  window  dimensions  to  design.    This 
complements  the  initial  method  of  material  control  provided  by  measurements  made  with  a 
coordinate  measuring  machine  (CMM).    Photogrammetry  derives  data  from  ~1000  points  in 
parallel, while the CMM obtains data serially, limiting the practical number of measured points.  
Photogrammetry  is  also  attractive  because,  unlike  CMM,  it  is  a  non-contact  method  of 
measurement.  This will be even more important when examining a future window design that is 
planned to be even thinner.   

 

21

6.6 Initial test setup (Window 4) 

 
The shape of the Window 4 was measured via photogrammetry by imaging the window from 
both the concave and convex sides, tying both sets of measurements together in one coordinate 
system via common targets in the referencing fixture.  
 
6.7 Comparison to design 
 

 

 

 

The photogrammetric results for Window 4 indicated that there is a bit of eccentricity in the 
window's shape.  This is evident from two approaches to view the data (Figure 18), whisker plots 
and plots of the difference between measurement and design (Figure 19).   

 
The data indicated a central thickness of 330µm.  This value, thinner than indicated by the 
CMM, is consistent with a burst pressure lower than that predicted by the FEA, which used the 
CMM thickness of 348um.

7. SURFACE MODELING 
 

photogrammetric technique to material control. 
 
7.1 TIN - Triangular Irregular Network  
 

Surface  modeling  techniques  are  being  developed  to  enhance  the  application  of  the 

An initial attempt was made to use a TIN to model the surface.  A TIN is a series of triangles, 
similar  to  that  of  a  geodesic  dome,  made  from  the  nodal  points  on  a  surface  (Fig.20).    Each 
triangle,  or  planar  facet,  represents  a  bounded  region  that  approximates  the  surface.    By 
supplying  an  X-Y  pair  within  the  boundary  to  the  equation  of  the  plane,  a  value  of  Z  may  be 
determined.  Small errors occur when the chosen X-Y pair is away from any of the nodal points.  
With  a  triangle  measuring  approximately  6mm  on  a  side,  and  a  nominal  300mm  radius  of  the 

 

22

spherical  surface,  the  maximum  separation  between  the  plane  and  the  sphere  is  about  6µm, 
always  the  same  sign.    Errors  in  thickness  using  TIN  modeling  for  the  convex  and  concave 
surfaces could be as great as +/- 15µm.  Since the target pattern density was at the limit, the use 
of TIN modeling was abandoned. 

 

 

Figure 20 

 

 
7.2 Small-Patch Sphere Fit (SPSF) 
 

In an effort to better model the window surface, a technique known as SPSF was developed.  
Taking advantage of the nearly spherical shape of the window, even at maximum deformation, a 
solution  involving  the  best-fit  sphere  determination  for  a  small  number  of  adjacent  nodal 
points,(15 to 25), was suggested.  A small number of sample solutions have shown that this is a 
very promising approach, providing best-fit RMS values in the 2-3µm range, similar to that of 
the RMS values for the nodal points selected. 

8. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS 
 
8.1 New window design 
 

A new shape for the absorber window is being developed which seeks an even thinner central 
region.  The surface shape being proposed is called a torisphere, a surface comprised of an outer 
partial torus, transitioning into a spherical dome.  This shape should act much like a bellows, 
thereby allowing operation at higher pressures for a given thickness (Figure 21). 

 

23

 

 
8.2 Production inspection 
 

    

Figure 21 

 

Production  inspection  of  the  absorber  windows  will  be  required.    The  discussion  of  issues 
associated  with  this  activity  is  continuing. 
  The  most  likely  scenario  will  call  for 
photogrammetric  inspection  of  each  window  produced.    Whether  that  will  be  pressurized 
dynamic  testing,  conformance  to  design  shape  verification,  or  some  combination  of  both,  is 
currently being considered.  
 
9. CONCLUSIONS 
 

This effort has shown: 

•  Non-contact  projection  targeting  can  be  successfully  integrated  into  the  digital 
photogrammetry measurements process for objects  of  modest  (<  0.5m)  size,  with  a 
precision of 3-5µm  

•  Repetitive displacement measurements are a suitable substitute for traditional strain 
gages  in  determining  stress  and  represents  a  great  advantage  where  non-contact  is 
crucial 

•  The  process  is  suitable  for  both  static  measurement  of  shape  for  conformance  to 
design, as well as dynamic deformation measurements for functional performance of 
the absorber windows 

•  Because  of  coverage,  speed,  and  portability,  photogrammetry  is  particularly  well 

suited for production inspection 

 
10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
 

This work would not have been possible without the guidance of Mary Anne Cummings, the 
expert engineering and FEA of the window design by Ed Black and Wing Lau, and the careful 
design and construction of the room temperature and cryogenic pressurization systems by Sasha 
Dychkant.

Appendix A - 'Beamstrahlung' 
 

'Beamstrahlung'  is  synchrotron  radiation  emitted  by  a  particle  as  it  traverses  a  bunch  of 

particles traveling in the opposite direction due to the electromagnetic field of the bunch. 

Appendix B - Determination of the length of the astronomical unit 
 

A  radar  pulse  is  sent  in  the  direction  of  Venus,  and  the  time  between  its  transmission  and 
reception is measured.  Since time can be measured with great accuracy, the distance to Venus 
and  the  dimensions  of  its  orbit  can  be  established  within  a  kilometer.    Once  repeated 
measurements  of  the  distance  to  Venus  at  closest  approach  and  at  most  distant  separation  are 
acquired,  the  diameter  and  eccentricity  of  both  the  Earth's  and  Venus'  orbit  can  be  computed.  
The  mean  distance  from  the  Earth  to  the  Sun  can  then  be  calculated  as  the  mean  of  these  two 
distances.    A  check  on  the  Earth-Venus  distance  has  been  obtained  from  trajectories  of  space 
vehicles sent to Venus [6].

ABSTRACT 

Chirality is of primary importance in many areas of chemistry and such 

a  topic  has  been  extensively  investigated  since  its  discovery.  We  introduce  here  the 

description  of  central  chirality  for  tetrahedral  molecules  using  a  geometrical  approach 

based on complex numbers. According to this representation, it is possible to define, for 

a molecule having n chiral centres, an “index of chirality χ”. Consequently, a “chirality 

selection  rule”  has  been  derived  which  allows  to  characterize  a  molecule  as  achiral, 

enantiomer or diastereoisomer. 

 

KEY WORDS: central molecular chirality; complex numbers; chirality selection rule 

 

 
 
 

 

Molecular chirality has a central role in organic chemistry. Most of the molecules of interest to 

the organic chemist are chiral, so, in the course of the years, a great amount of experimental work 

has  been  devoted  to  the  selective  formation  of  molecules  with  a  given  chirality,  the  so  called 

asymmetric synthesis.1 

Chirality was defined by Lord Kelvin2 almost one century ago as follows: “I call any geometrical 

figure,  or  groups  of  points,  chiral,  and  say  it  has  chirality,  if  its  image  in  a  plane  mirror,  ideally 

realized,  cannot  be  brought  to  coincide  with  itself”.  The  corresponding  definition  of  an  achiral 

molecule can be expressed as: “if a structure and its mirror image are superimposable by rotation or 

any motion other than bond making and breaking, than they are identical”. Chiral molecules having 

central  chirality  contain  stereogenic  centres.3  Given  two  molecules  with  identical  chemical 

formulas, if they are not superimposable, they are called enantiomers. In general, the term chirality 

has a broader sense, for example, chirality can be due to a spatial isomerism resulting from the lack 

of  free  rotation  around  single  or  double  bonds  (which  means  that  the  molecule  has  a  chiral  axis) 

such  as  respectively  in  biphenyl4  and  in  allene5  derivatives,  rather  than  due  to  the  presence  of 

stereogenic centres (Fig. 1).

In this contribution, we refer to the term of chirality in the narrow sense of central chirality for 

the tetrahedral molecules which are the most common class of chiral molecules. When the molecule 

contains  more  than  one  chiral  centre,  a  further  definition  has  to  be  introduced.  In  this  case,  two 

molecules  with  identical  structural  formulas,  which  are  not  mirror  images  of  each  other  and  not 

superimposable, are termed diastereoisomers (Fig. 2).

Most properties of molecules are invariant to reflection (scalar properties), when examined in an 

achiral environment and enantiomers will be identical in many respects such as solubility, density, 

melting point, chromatographic retention times, spectroscopic behaviour. It is only with respect to 

properties  that  change  sign,  but  not  magnitude,  upon  reflection  (pseudoscalar  properties)  such  as 

optical rotation,6 optical rotatory dispersion (ORD),7 circular dichroism (CD),8 vibrational circular 

dichroism  (VCD)9 that enantiomers  differ. In  contrast, diastereoisomers exhibit different chemical 

and physical properties. It is evident that molecular chirality is fundamentally connected to spatial 

symmetry  operations10  and  has  the  features  of  a  geometrical  property.  Interestingly,  chirality  has 

been  recently  treated  as  a  continuous  phenomenon11  of  achiral  symmetry  breaking  and  this 

approach has brought to the description of molecules as “more or less chiral” just as doors are more 

or  less  open.  In  the  present  article,  on  the  basis  of  the  dichotomous  character  of  chirality,  we 

describe  this  topic  using  a  geometrical  approach  leading  us  to  enucleate  algebraic  structures12  of 

tetrahedral central chirality. 

THEORY AND DISCUSSION 

The spatial properties of achiral molecules, enantiomers and diastereoisomers can be considered 

under the same standard of a geometrical description and we wonder whether some features exist in 

order to describe such classes of molecules by the same parameters. 

Our  approach  is  based  on  complex  numbers  since  this  is  a  straightforward  way  to  represent  the 

“length” of the bond with respect to the stereogenic centre and the “angular position” with respect 

to the other bonds. In general, given a tetrahedral molecule with a stereogenic centre, we can always 

project it on a plane containing the stereogenic centre as in Fig. 3.

where 

jρ  is  the  “modulus”,  i.e.  the  projected  length  of  the  bond, 

jθ  is  the  “anomaly”,  i.e.  the 

position of the bond with respect to the x, y axes (and then with respect to the other bonds) having 

chosen  a  rotation  versus.  The  number

in  any  symmetry  plane.  If  the  molecule  has  n  stereogenic  centres,  we  can  define  n  planes  of 

projection  (one  for  each  centre).  Such  planes  can  be  parallel  among  them,  but  this  feature  is  not 

essential.  Now,  the  bonds  of  the  different  groups  bound  to  the  same  chiral  centre  and  the  bonds 

among the centres have to be taken into account. So if a molecule with one centre has four bonds, a 

molecule with two centres has seven bonds and so on. The general rule is

assuming,  as  standard,  simply  connected  tetrahedrons.  When  atoms  are  present,  which  act  as 

“spacers” between the tetrahedral chiral centres, the number of bonds changes from 3n+1 to 4n (as 

for  ex:  (1-sec-butoxy-butyl)-benzene),  but  the  following  considerations  for  consecutive  connected 

tetrahedrons remain valid. A molecule with n stereogenic centres is then given by the sum vector

where  k  is  the  “centre-index”  and  j  is  the  “bond-index”.  Again,  for  any  k,  a  projective  plane  of 

symmetry is defined. The couple of numbers

where k is the generic tetrahedron (i.e. the centre index). The case n=1 gives the simple tetrahedron. 

Having  in  mind  the  definition  of  chirality,  the  behaviour  of  the  molecule  under  rotation  and 

superimposition  has  to  be  studied  in  order  to  see  if  the  structure  and  its  mirror  image  are 

superimposable.  Chirality  emerges  when  two  molecules  with  identical  structural  formulas  are  not 

superimposable. Considering the geometrical representation reported in Fig. 3, a possible situation 

is  the  following:  let  us  take  into  account  a  rotation  of  180°  in  the  space  around  a  generic  axis  L 

passing  through  the  stereogenic  centre.  Such  an  axis  can coincide, for the sake of simplicity with 

one of the bonds. After the rotation two bonds result surimposable while the other two are inverted. 

The situation can be illustrated by the projection on the plane {x,y} as shown in Fig.4.

                       [6] 

In order to observe the reflection, the four groups must be of different nature (see Fig. 1). This 

simple  observation  shows  that  the  chirality  is  connected  with  an  inversion  of  two  bonds  in  the 

projective  symmetry  plane.  On  the  contrary,  if  after  the  rotation  and  superimposition  (Fig.  4), 

molecule  I  is  identical  to  molecule  II,  we  are  in  an  achiral  situation.  Such  a  treatment  can  be 

repeated  for  any  projective  symmetry  plane  which  can  be  defined  for  the  n  centres.  The  possible 

results are that the molecule is fully invariant after rotation(s) and superimposition with respect to 

its mirror image (achiral); the molecule is partially invariant after rotation(s) and superimposition, 

i.e.  some  tetrahedrons  are  superimposable  while  others  are  not  (diastereoisomers);  the  molecule 

presents an inversion for each stereogenic centre (enantiomers). The following rule can be derived: 

central chirality is assigned by the number χ given by the couple n, p that is

                                                              [7]

This  definition  of  chirality  is  related  to  the  structure  of  the  molecule  and  its  properties  under 

rotations and superimposition.

It is easy to see that the matrix [11] has a unitary part (upper part) and an anti-unitary part (lower 

part).  It  can  be  considered  a  composition  of  a  rotation  and  a reflection. If two of the components 

jΨ are  the  same  chemical  group,  i.e. 

3 Ψ=Ψ

,  it  follows  that 

ΜΜ ≡

and  we  have  an  achiral 

situation. However,  χˆ  can act on any couple of groups 

Ψ

and Ψ

 so that, in general, we can define 

an algebra of 

kχˆ  operators13 where k is an index which runs over the possible permutations.

where λ are the eigenvalues and  Iˆ  is the identity matrix. In our specific case, Eq. [12] reduces to

                                                           [13] 

The eigenvalues are 

1±=λ

, with 

1=λ  triply degenerate. The eigenvector equation for  χˆ  can be 

written as 

where ϕis an eigenvector. 

λϕϕ=χˆ

                                                                         [14] 

If 

1=λ , the action of  χˆ  on the (molecule) eigenvector ϕ gives the “same”vector (achirality); 

if 

1−=λ

, the action of  χˆ  on ϕ gives an inversion (chirality), i.e. the enantiomer. 

In order to study the chirality of a “chain of tetrahedrons”, the operator  χˆ  has to be applied on the 

molecule n times (one for each stereogenic centre). The molecule is completely achiral if after 

nˆχ , 

the  mirror  image  is  superimposable  (

).  The  molecule  is  an  enantiomer  if,  after 

0=p

nˆχ , 

p =  
n

inversions  are  observed,  while  a  diastereoisomer  is  obtained  if,  after 

nˆχ ,  p  <  n  inversions  are 

observed.  In  other  words,  the  central  chirality  of  a  molecule  can  be  expressed  with  respect to the 

base  of  the  eigenvectors  ϕ  (corresponding  to 

1=λ )  and  ϕ(corresponding  to 

1−=λ

).  Any 

molecule with n stereogenic centres is the linear combination of the eigenvectors  ϕand  ϕ, p is the 

number of times in which inversions of groups occur (i.e. p is the sum of eigenvalues 

1−=λ

), n is 

the number of application of  χˆ . In this sense, the couple 

χ

{≡

}
pn,

 assigns the central chirality of a 

given  molecule  and  it  is  a  selection  rule  which  describes  achiral  molecules,  enantiomers  and 

diastereoisomers. As an example, the chirality of the degenerate case meso-tartaric acid (Fig. 5), can 

be reduced to this rule. In this case, three groups of the two tetrahedrons are identical and the fourth 

group  is  the  other  stereogenic  carbon  centre.  As  it  can  be  seen  from  the  figure,  by  a 

superimposition, the molecule and its mirror image are the same (

0=p

). The structure is achiral.

CONCLUSIONS 

In  this  contribution,  we  outlined  a  description  of  central  molecular  chirality  of  tetrahedral 

molecules  by  a  geometrical  approach  based  on  complex  numbers.  It  is  essential  the  fact  that  the 

molecule is decomposable in tetrahedrons. An index of chirality χ has been defined as a function of 

n (number of stereogenic centres in the molecule) and p (number of permutations observed under 

rotations and superimposition to the mirror image). It is worth stressing again that this rule holds for 

simply connected chains of tetrahedrons, but it could be eventually generalized also for other forms 

of  chirality,  e.g.  axial  chirality.  In  the  above  discussion,  the  algebraic  structure  of  our  approach 

emerged. It is interesting to note that the operator  χˆ  acts in a way similar to the Dirac matrices.14

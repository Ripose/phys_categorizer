Climate change in California may require construction of a barrier separating the Pacific Ocean from 
San  Francisco  Bay  and  the  Sacramento  River-San  Joaquin  River  Delta  simply  because  Southern 
California is remarkably dependent on freshwater exported from the Delta.  We offer a new kind of salt 
barrier, a macroproject built of impermeable textile materials stretched across the Golden Gate beneath 
the famous bridge.  We anticipate it might eventually substitute for a recently proposed “San Francisco 
In-Stream Tidal Power Plant” harnessing a 1.7 m tide at the Bay’s entrance if future climate conditions 
Statewide is conducive.  First-glance physics underpin our macroproject. 

Abstract

1. Introduction

While  the  public  in  Europe  and  the  USA  apparently  have  adopted  a  common  outlook  of  technical 
resignation  towards  the  world’s  evident  post-Ice  Age  rising  ocean,  macroengineers  in  Dubai 
assiduously sculpt the seashore and create new inhabitable islands (Koolhaas, 2006; Marreiros, 2006).  
Indeed, by emplacement of a Strait  of Hormuz  Dam, Macro-engineering’s  foremost proponents  have 
formulated  a  workable  plan  to  isolate  the  Persian  Gulf  from  the  ocean  (Schuiling  et  al.,  2005)  and, 
thereby,  making  the  Persian  Gulf’s  water  level  controllable.    It  is  true  that  macroprojects  protecting 
major  European  cities  from  storm-surges—such  as  London  (Lavery  and  Donovan,  2005),  St. 
Petersburg  (Klevanny  and  Smirnova,  2002)  and  Venice  (Fletcher  and  Spencer,  2005)—have  been 
constructed  or  continue  to  be  considered.    The  in-place  infrastructures  of  The  Netherlands  are  well 
known (Smits et al., 2006)!  In Asia, a movable textile seawater barrier facility is proposed to shield 
Palk  Bay,  located  between  India  and  Sri  Lanka,  from  infrequent  tsunami  and  yearly  storm  surges 
(Cathcart, 2006).  To  “correct oceanographic  problems impairing  the  economic usefulness  of coastal 
land”, Richard B. Cathcart  and Alexander A. Bolonkin (2007) offered  a deliberate “terracing” of the 
Mediterranean Sea within its vast Basin by its enclosure with a textile barrier at the Strait of Gibraltar 
that  controllably  excludes  Mediterranean  Sea  evaporation  compensation  Atlantic  Ocean  seawater 
inflow.  Such comprehensive and geographically large-scale corrective macroproject concepts stem, in 
part,  from  stimulation  initiated  by  a  summarizing  technical  book  about  Macro-engineering’s 
burgeoning professionalism (Badescu et al., 2006).

2. Good cause for concern by coastal Americans

Before  Macro-engineering  and  macro-management  can  be  considered  in  the  context  of  California’s 
coast, a fundamental question must be asked: Is sea level rising along the USA’s coast?  After 1970, 
the  world’s  news  media  discovered  “global  warming”  and,  since  then,  many  prominent  Californian 
legislators  and  politicians,  such  as  Governor  Arnold  Schwarzenegger  during  2007,  as  well  as  other 
citizens are nowadays  convinced that anthropogenic  carbon  dioxide  and other  greenhouse gas global 
emissions are directly responsible for raising the Pacific Ocean’s level of impingement on the State’s 
coastline.    Still,  the  tandem  link  between  enhanced  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  global  sea 
level rise is  still  an unresolved matter of  geoscientific dispute (Larsen and  Clark, 2006).  As Earth’s 
most  recent  Ice  Age  wanes,  the  world’s  atmosphere  is  likely  to  warm,  some  glaciers  will  become 
smaller and the ocean impacting the USA’s coast will probably rise to an elevation noticeably above 
the present-day’s level.

3. East Coast: Metropolitan New York City sea level rise impacts

Storm-induced  seawater  surges,  caused  by  hurricanes  and  nor’easters,  have  in  the  past  impacted  the 
metropolitan  New  York  City  region.    Future local  sea  level  rise  is  expected  to  boost  the  destructive 
power of such storms to disrupt the function of vital urban infrastructure and to injure and kill people 
(Gornitz, 2002).  Consequently, the possibility of protecting the Metropolitan Region with storm-surge 
barriers  is  being  studied.    Closable  steel  and  concrete  storm-surge  barriers  erected  in  three  straits 
(between New York Bay and Lower New York Bay, Arthur Kill and near the Throngs Neck Bridge) 
could effectively, though  only temporarily, seal  off the  Metropolitan Region  from incoming Atlantic 
Ocean-generated storm-surges (Bowman et al., 2005). 

4. Gulf Coast: post-2005 New Orleans Region recovery

By  the  end  of  2007,  the  US  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  must  present  to  Congress  a  long-term, 
comprehensive  plan  for  hydraulic  macroprojects  that  will  offer  Gulf  Coast  residents  and  industry  a 
predictably  successful  future  defense  against  hurricane  storm-surge  damage  (Sparks,  2006).    A 
complex  integrated  system  of  walls,  barriers,  offshore  breakwaters,  barrier  island  beach  dune 
restoration, repaired or new levees, and massive mobile mechanical barrages that would  close across 
inlets  to  exclude  surging  hurricane-stirred  seawater  and  freshwater  is  being  considered.    Americans 
have modified the Gulf Region’s coast, either directly, by construction or dredging, or indirectly, as a 
consequence  of  profound  inland  landscape  changes  that  then  influence  future  sediment  supply, 
freshwater runoff, or the Gulf Region’s climate (Shallat, 2006).  

The commonest settlement/use practices that significantly alter the USA’s coast are the construction of 
coast-protection  infrastructures  such  as  jetties,  groins,  seawalls,  bulkheads,  revetments  and  the 
development  of  private  and  public  property  on  and  close  to  the  shoreline.    These  oceanographic 
infrastructures constitute “Hard Structure Armoring”.  The alternative is “Beach Nourishment”.  Beach 
nourishment  is  the  only  coastal  macro-management  technique  that  adds  sand  to  the  littoral  system 
nearest  the  seashore.    Generally  speaking,  “Hard  Structure  Armoring”  is  monetarily  the  costliest—
about 10% of initial installation cost annually—to maintain in a robust state of physical readiness.

5. West Coast: San Francisco Bay/Delta Region

Last  year,  the  U.S.  Geological  Survey  published  a  useful  geographical  and  historical  survey  of 
California’s coastal land gains and losses (Hapke et al, 2006).  The present-day post-Ice Age sea level 
rise at the entrance to the 890 square kilometer Bay of San Francisco is ~2.29 cm/decade.  Future sea 
level rise,  and  the subsequent elevated storm-surges  thereon,  may severely affect  San  Francisco Bay 
shoreline  cities,  the  levee-enclosed  low-lying  land  above  the  intertidal  flats  (Jaffee  and  Foxgrover, 
2006) and, very importantly, the adjacent Sacramento River/San Joaquin River Delta.  

Massive seawater intrusions into the largest bay on California’s coast, its wetlands, associated surface 
freshwater storage systems and  groundwater  aquifers are undesirable  prospective  degradations of the 
San  Francisco  Bay/Delta.    For  example,  it  is  imaginable  that  the  Harvey  O.  Banks  Pumping  station 
feeding the California Aqueduct and the Tracy Pumping Plant feeding the Delta-Mendota Canal would 
have  to  cease  operation,  at  least  temporarily.    Contamination  of  the  Delta’s  freshwater  with  a 
permanent  influx  of saltwater  would endanger  a  massive  public  freshwater  supply that  is pumped  to 
Southern California!  

“Projected  sea  level  rises  of  20-80  cm…during  the  twenty-first  century  can  only  be  expected  to 
compound  the  vulnerability  of  subsided  Delta  Islands  to  levee  failure…and  increase  upstream 
backwater flooding” (Cayan et al., 2006).  The Delta receives runoff from about 40% of California’s 
land  area  (163,000  square  kilometers)  and  about  50%  of  the  State’s  total  streamflow.    A  great 
earthquake  at  the  infamous  nearby  San  Andreas  Fault—more  powerful  than  the  7.1  Richter  scale 
“Loma  Prieta”  earthquake  of  17  October  1989—could  cause  many  kilometers  of  Delta  levees  to 
collapse.  Widespread Delta levee failure would divert river flow into many Delta polders—perhaps as 
much at 2.5 to 3.0 billion cubic meters (Mount and Twiss, 2005)—and, consequently, generate a strong 
flow of seawater from San Francisco Bay eastward into the unprotected Delta, suddenly contaminating 
the freshwater normally pumped to Southern California’s populace!  The volume of San Francisco Bay 
is ~6.165 billion cubic meters.  It has a mean depth of ~6 m.  

In  addition,  a  nearly  inevitable  increase  of  human  population  on  San  Francisco  Bay’s  periphery  is 
expected  to  require  desalination  plants  providing  a  reliable  future  supplemental  freshwater  supply 
(Yeung, 2005).  Social fabrics and vital infrastructure will be stressed and strained negatively (Gleick 
and  Maurer,  1980;  Hayhoe  et  al.,  2004).    Furthermore,  future  industrial  accidents  may  cause  the 
generation  of  an  infrastructure-devastating  tsunami  that  might  reach  inland  seaports  such  as 
Sacramento and Stockton, especially at high tide or during periods of storm-surge (Greenberg, 1993).  
Though computer models predict the 21st Century’s climate for California will be dryer than today, it is 
worth noting that, during January 1862, the “…outflow of fresh water into the bays of San Francisco 
and  into  the  Pacific  Ocean  through  the Golden  Gate  was  both  large  and  persistent.    Sea  level  at  the 
Golden  Gate  was  17  cm  above  normal….  For  nearly  two  weeks  fresh  water  flowed  continually 
seaward  through  the  Golden  Gate,  without  tidal  fluctuation.    Fresh  water  covered  the  surface  of 
the…[sub-embayments] for two to three  months”  (Engstrom, 1996).   Peterson et al (1985) estimated 
that  a  freshwater  inflow  of  ~120,000  m3/second  would  have  been  necessary  to  overcome  the  tides 
[tidal range: maximum 2.65 m, ~2.0 billion cubic meters moving at ~2.5 m/second every 6 hours]  at 
the Golden Gate during January 1862!  In other words, an identical flood flow rate today could fill San 
Francisco Bay entirely with freshwater in only 14.27 hours!  

What if California’s climate becomes wetter than today?  In that eventuality, more freshwater may be 
exported  to  Southern  California.    But  if,  as  predicted,  California  becomes  drier,  then  San  Francisco 
Bay  may need  to  be dammed at the Golden Gate  to  forestall saltwater intrusion  into  the  Delta.  The 
entrance to San Francisco Bay, the deepest in the bay (107 m), is an elongate seafloor depression with 
3

steep sidewalls of 100 to 170.  The ocean shoals immediately west of the Golden Gate to a depth of ~38 
m.    FIGURE  1,  below,  is  a  computer  simulation  of  the  seafloor  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Golden  Gate 
Bridge.    Farther  out  to  sea,  a  huge  arcuate  sandbar  is  present  which  is  a  relict  from  the  Ice  Age.  
Immediately  after  the  18  April  1906  earthquake,  a  tidal  anomaly  at  the  Presidio’s  tide-gauge  station 
was registered that indicated a 10 cm lowering of the sea level for a quarter of an hour followed by two 
to three tidal oscillations with maximum amplitude of only 5 cm (Geist and Zoback, 2002).

6. The Region’s planned, but unbuilt, Hard Structure Armoring 

Fig. 1.

Rivers  first  passed  seaward  through  the  Golden  Gate  approximately  500,000  years  ago  and  post-Ice 
Age  sea  level  first  rose  high  enough  to  flow  into  the  Bay  of  San  Francisco  about  15,000  years  ago 
(Dartnell  et  al.,  2006).    The  northern  reach  is  a  partially  mixed  sub-embayment  dominated  by 
seasonally varying freshwater inflows while the south reach is a tidally oscillating estuary.  The Bay of 
San Francisco is an ocean-river mixing zone with a seaward flow equal to the sum of the river inflows 
less  precipitation;  at  the  present  time  only  the  freshwater  inflow  can  be  subjected  to  macro-
management.  During droughts, freshwater inflows have been, effectively, nil; droughts have produced 
saltwater  intrusions  of  the  Sacramento  River-San  Joaquin  River  Delta.    Anti-saltwater  intrusion 
barriers  were  first  proposed  by  nascent  macroengineers  during  the  1920s  as  a  means  of  halting  the 
contamination of Delta farmland irrigation freshwater as well as that used by nearby industries.  

Since  about  1950—the  year  when  the  term  “coastal  engineering”  was  first  used  in  print  in  the 
Proceedings  of  the  First  Conference  on  Coastal  Engineering—most  of  San  Francisco  Bay  has 
shifted  from  being  depositional  to  erosional  as  sediment  supply  diminished  (when  dams  were  built 

4

inland) and existing currents and waves continued to remove sediment from the Region.  Essentially all 
of San Francisco Bay has an anthropogenic character (Chin et al, 2004).  Any future rise of the Pacific 
Ocean  will,  therefore,  impact  all  existing  and  planned  shoreline  infrastructures.    In  1990,  landscape 
architect  Steven  Garey  Abrahams  proposed  “Landscape  Mobilis”  which  would  consist  of  a  fleet  of 
waterborne  landscapes—gardens,  forests,  meadows,  crops,  vineyards  on  barges  towed  around  San 
Francisco Bay, visiting “receptacle parks” at strategic places along the shore (Raver, 1991).    

When  saltwater  intrusions  of  the  Delta  first  became  a  remarkable  macro-problem  for  commercial 
farming  and  industry  in  the  Delta  during  the  early  1900s,  macroengineers  of  the  time  proposed 
physical barriers to block the inland migration of salty water.  Many salt barrier plans were formulated, 
most of which involved the construction of low-level dams to separate freshwater upstream from the 
tidal seawater on the downstream  side.  Following the very low Delta outflow of 1923-1924, a 1929 
macroproject  plan  for  a  barrier built  at  the  Golden  Gate  was the  greatest  in  geographical  scope  ever 
promoted  by  reclamation  and  hydraulic  experts.    Offered  by  Walker  R.  Young,  and  had  it  been 
constructed, the dam would have become the longest “Hard Structure Armoring” of California’s coast 
ever conceived and, so far, discussed (Young, 1929)!     FIGURE 2, below illustrates Young’s concept.

Fig. 2.

It  would  have  been  unnecessary  to  fabricate  the  Golden  Gate  Bridge,  completed  in  1938,  if  W.R. 
Young’s 1927-29 enclosure work and super-highway had ever been constructed!

5

Walker Rollo Young (1885-1982), a 1908 University of Idaho graduate of engineering, became Chief 
Engineer  at  the  USA’s  Bureau  of  Reclamation  in  1945  after  serving,  from  1930,  as  Construction 
Engineer  at  Hoover  Dam.    Due  to  its  site,  W.R.  Young’s  “Golden  Gate  Dam  and  Highway”  would 
have made the small embayment west of his proposed saltwater barrier a collection place for material 
being moved by wave and current action in the littoral cells to the north and south of the entrance to an 
areally smaller, enclosed Bay of San Francisco (Barnard, 2005; d’Angremond and van Roode, 2004).  
Maintenance  dredging  would  have  become  necessary.    Basically,  his  “Golden  Gate  Dam  and 
Highway”  would  have  shortened  the  fetch  of  winds  driving  waves  into  San  Francisco  Bay—such 
winds are strongest during Summer and during Winter storms—and since San Francisco Bay was to be 
a  freshwater  lake—one  might  say,  a  “real-estate  lake”  (Rickert,  1971)—the  ecology  of  the  Region 
would duplicate that endured by the Region during January 1862! 

Subsequent to Young’s concept, from 1933 until is death, John Reber (1899-1960) campaigned for his 
plan  to  convert  ~85%  of  the  bay  into  a  freshwater  lake  by  closing  off  the  bay’s  northernmost  and 
southernmost  reaches  and  adding  housing  and  industrial  sites  to  the  artificial  shore.    Similar 
macroprojects, with different geographical and economical goals, were offered by Norman Sper, who 
suggested that the Hudson River between New York Harbor and the Harlem River be filled with rock 
and soil, thereby making Manhattan Island no longer an island (Albelli, 1934).  Imagine “Tetrahedral 
City” invented by R. Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) floating peacefully on Walker R. Young’s vision 
of Lake San Francisco (Fuller and Marks, 1973)!

7. Opportunity for future Golden Gate Textile Barrier (GGTB)

The  GGTB  is  worthy  of  investigation  at  this  time  because  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  is 
considering the installation of a tidal in-stream hydroelectric permeable “curtain” spanning the Golden 
Gate  near  the  present-day  bridge  connecting  San  Francisco  and  Marin  Counties  of  California.    Gulf 
Stream Energy, Inc. and Golden Gate Energy Company’s Joint Application for Preliminary Permit for 
the San Francisco Bay Tidal Energy Project under P-12585-000 was filed on 26 April 2005 with the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.C.   

On 10 June 2006 a thorough technical examination of such a system for submarine power generation—
that  is,  its  system  design,  potential  performance,  construction  and  operational  costs,  as  well  as  its 
economic  and  environmental  benefits  by  the  Electric  Power  Research  Institute  Inc.  (EPRI)  was 
publicly displayed (Previsic, 2006).  EPRI’s experts concluded that ~35 MW could be extracted from 
the tidal stream “…without any negative impact on the environment” at a facility running North-South 
along the 122.478360 West meridian from 37.81110 North (on the San Francisco side of the strait) to 
37.82650 North (on the Marin County side of the strait), a distance of ~1,380 m where the mean depth 
is  ~54  m.    Since  the  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco  has  an  estimated  average  electrical  power 
consumption  of  ~570  MW it  is,  therefore,  possible  that  approximately  6%  of  the  City  and  County’s 
electrical supply could be developed by an underwater tidal energy “permeable curtain”.  Obviously, 
this  nearly  $100  million  facility  will  not  dam  the  Golden  Gate  nor  will  it  impede  the  navigation  of 
vessels entering or leaving the Bay of San Francisco, California.  What it seems to indicate is (1) some 
influential people and organizations in San Francisco will tolerate an invisible hydropower plant at the 
Golden Gate and (2) future macroengineering improvements there might also be tolerated if the Pacific 
Ocean should rise and/or the runoff passing through the Sacramento River-San Joaquin River Delta is 
greatly  reduced  by  State-wide future  climate  change.    The  great  seafloor  pit  below  the  Golden  Gate 
Bridge may prove to be a boon since it can hold a great deal of sediment that may shift westwards from 
the central part of the Bay of San Francisco.  And, if a Golden Gate Textile Barrier is emplaced, sand 
6

naturally migrating in the shallow Pacific Ocean’s nearest littoral cell may improve the tsunami run-up 
on  the  facing  cliffed-coastline  that  is  present  north  and  south  of  the  entrance  to  San  Francisco  Bay.  
The GGTB would likely be equipped with penetrating ship locks, perhaps emulating the design offered 
by Martin Cullen in his U.S. Patent Application 20050163570 issued 28 July 2005.

8. Seawater/freshwater textile tension structure

The typical textile barrier—more accurately, a membrane—is shown in FIGURE 3, below.  FIGURE 3 
includes  the  textile  membrane  seawater/freshwater  barrier,  floats,  underwater  pump/electricity 
generation, and the support cable.  The hydropower dam can safely operate even when the water level 
on one side is as much at 10 m.

8.1. Theory and Computation

1. Relative concentration of salt in water.

When a river’s freshwater inflows to a closed estuary that passes the freshwater only in one direction 
(to  ocean),  the  salt  concentration  of  the  seawater  decreases.  New  relative  concentration  may  be 
computed by equation

                                                         
where Q is a relative inflow of a river freshwater.  Q = q/W where q is inflow of freshwater, m3; W is volume 
of like (golf), m3; t is time, sec.  Computation for this equation is illustrated below

9. Conclusions

A drastic change in the State of California’s climate—that is, a drying future period or a future wetter period 
compared to today’s alleged “normal”—may necessitate the construction of a Golden Gate Textile Barrier.  We 
have shown how this may be accomplished, but only in a preliminary Macro-engineering way.

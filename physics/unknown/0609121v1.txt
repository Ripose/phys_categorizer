Abstract 
 
We demonstrate rather interesting manifestations of co-existence of resonance features 
in characteristics of the photoionization of 3d-electrons in Xe@C60. It is shown that the 
reflection  of  photoelectrons  produced  by  the  3d  Xe  photoionization  affects  greatly 
2/53d
 levels and respective angular 
partial photoionization cross-sections of 
anisotropy  parameters,  both  dipole  and  non-dipole  adding  to  all  of  them  additional 
maximums  and  minimums.  The  calculations  are  performed  treating  the  3/2  and  5/2 
electrons as electrons of different kinds with their spins “up” and “down”. The effect of 
С60 shell is accounted for in the frame of the “orange” skin potential model.

1. Introduction 
 

2/33d

 and 

Recently, a great deal of attention was and still is concentrated on photoionization 
of endohedral atoms. It was demonstrated in a number of papers that the C60 shell adds 
prominent  resonance  structure.  Although  the  experimental  investigation  of  A@C60 
photoionization seems to be very difficult at this moment, it will be inevitably studied in 
the future. This justifies the current efforts of the theorists that are predicting rather non-
trivial effects waiting for verification. 

The  role  of  C60  in  A@C60  photoionization  is  manifold.  C60  act  as  a  spherical 
potential  resonator  that  reflects  the  photoelectron  wave  coming  from  A  atom,  thus 
leading  to  interference  and  so-called  confinement  resonances.  C60  at  some  frequencies 
acts  as  a  dynamical  screen  that  is  capable  to  suppress  or  enhance  the  incident 
electromagnetic radiation acting upon the doped atom A. The reflection and refraction 
of the photoelectron waves by the potential resonator is prominent up to 60 – 80 eV of 
the electron energy. Whereas the screening effects of the C60 shell are particularly strong 
for incident radiation frequency ω∗/ of about that of the C60 Giant resonance, i.e. 20 – 
22 eV, but is noticeable in a much broader region, from ionization threshold up to again 
60 – 80 eV. 

Of  special  interest  is  the  interference  between  atomic  and  C60  resonances.  An 
impressive example of it is the photoionization of 3d Xe@C60 where along with new so-
called intra-doublet resonance that is a result of strong action of 3d3/2 level upon 3d5/2 
one there is a strong action of the C60 potential upon the electron waves that are emitted 
from both, 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 levels, which leads to interference phenomenon. 

To consider the role of this interference upon all characteristics of the 3d Xe@C60 

photoionization is the aim of the present paper. 

                                                 
∗ / Atomic system of units is used in this paper

At  photon  energy  ω  above  the  3d  subshell  ionization  threshold 

dI 3   the  dynamic 
polarizability  of  C60  and  the  screening  effects  of  C60  shell  are  already  small  enough. 
Therefore,  incident  photons  freely  penetrate  inside  the  C60  cavity  and  interacts  with 
dI 3   the 
electrons  of  the  doped  Xe  atom.  On  the  other  hand,  even  50  –  60  eV  above 
photoelectrons  from  3d  Xe  interact  strongly  enough  with  C60  being  scattered  both 
elastically and inelastic by the fullerene shell.  

In this paper we will concentrate on elastic scattering as a more powerful effect that 
prominently modifies the cross section of 3d Xe while it is located inside of C60. But we 
will not discuss here the inelastic process – the exchange Auger decay of 3d3/2 vacancy – 
that proceeds by its transition into 3d5/2 with emission of an electron from

Exchange (RPAE) equations for atoms with semi-filled shells (so-called Spin Polarized 
RPAE or SP RPAE) are solved, as described in e.g. [2]. For semi-filled shell atoms the 
following relation gives the differential in angle photoionization cross-section by non-
polarized light, which is similar to that of closed shell atoms [3] (see also e.g. [4]):

The solid line presents the

The  amplitude  factor  (18)  is  defined  by  the  values  of  the  photoelectron  wave 
functions  with  the  “up”  and  “down”  spins  at  the  point  r  =  R.  Since  we  deal  with  the 
completely  filled  3d  Xe  subshell  the  role  of  the  spin  effects  in  behavior  of  the  wave 
function is small. Hence the continuum wave functions for the “up” and “down” spins at 
this point are almost equal. So, the amplitude factors 
 for the 3/2 and 5/2 levels are 
similar to each other. However, since the background cross-sections for the isolated Xe 
atom are significantly different, the interference of 3/2 and 5/2 intra-doublet resonances 
and  confinement  resonances  leads  to  essentially  different  cross-sections    for  Xe@C60 
compounds, which we see in Figs. 3 and 4.

Analyzing  the  Figures,  we  see  that  the  presence  of  the  C60  shell  enhances 
 electron action. In general, the 
 due to the 
prominently the maximum in 
respective non-dipole parameters for the 3/2 and 5/2 electrons are similar. Particularly 
strong  is  the  deviation  from  the  isolated  atom  values  close  to  thresholds.  Entirely,  we 
see  that  the  presence  of  the  C60  shell  leads  to  prominent  extra  additional  resonance 
structure in all the characteristics of the photoionization of Xe@C60

Abstract

We have proposed two new dynamic networks where two node are swapped each other, and showed that
the both networks behave as a small world like in the average path length but can not make any eﬀective
discussions on the clustering coeﬃcient because of the topological invariant properties of the networks. In
this article we introduce a new index, ”hamming coeﬃcient” or ”multiplicity”, that can act well for these
dynamic networks. The hamming coeﬃcient or multiplicity is shown essentially to behave as the clustering
coeﬃcient in the small world network proposed by Watts and Strogatz[4]. By evaluating the new index,
we uncover another properties of the two networks.

key words: Small world network, Scale free network, node swapping network, clustering coeﬃcient, haming

1 Introduction

In a social network, we may need to consider the possibility that people is transferred to another place. Then

the physical (direct) relations among them are often lost by the movement. In terms of a network theory,

this means that some nodes break the present connections with neighboring nodes, move and there build new

connections with nodes. For simplicity, we here consider only that two nodes exchange the place each other on

the network. Such exchange is assumed to be constantly carried out. Some properties such as the diameter,

the average path length, the propagation when one virus is placed on the network, have been studied by the

author[10] where it has been pointed out that the swapping networks look like a little small world property

but have rather intermedidate properties between the small world network (SW-NET) introduced by Watts

and Strogatz[4],[5] and regular lattices. In this article, we study the dynamic networks in more details.

The clustering coeﬃcient is used in usual network analyses. There are, however, two diﬃcult points

in estimating it in node swapping networks (NSN). First is that general dynamic networks such as swapping

networks has a time dependent clustering coeﬃcient, unlike ststic networks such as SW-NET or the preferencial

scale free model (SF-NET) introduced by Barabasi and Albert[1],[2],[3], where they are usually alalyzed after

networks are completed. Second is that the topology of the NSN is invariant under the swapping of nodes,

because swapped nodes inherit the all links connected with old nodes after swapping, and so the clustering

coeﬃcient is trivially constant. Thus we need to introduce a sort of new index corresponding to the clustering

coeﬃent.

In any dynamic networks, it would be crucial that some propagation process is considered. We

consider the situation that a test virus is randomly placed on a node on NSN. The virus propagates a next

one connected with the ﬁrst target node. We compare the similarity of the frendships of two nodes, the ﬁrst

node i and propagated node j, that is to say, estimate the hamming distance between the two nodes with

adjacent vectors, vi and vj that are the i−th row component and j−th row component of the adjacent matrix

corresponding to the network, respectively. The estimated quantity is related only to the simirality of two

connected nodes. The clustering coeﬃcient are related to the similarity of all nodes connected with a target

1

node. So the new index can interpreted to be a sort of the shortening of the clustering coeﬃcient. A virus

propagates from the target node to connected nodes one after another and we estimate the index every time the

virus infects some connected node. We consider the average hamming distance of them duaring propagation

till all nodes are infected. We compare the average hamming distance with the clustering coeﬃcient of SW-

NET. As result we turn out that they show the similar behaviours as the rewiring probability increases. So this

suggests that we can use this new index instead of the clustering coeﬃcient in dynamic networks. By evaluating

the new index, we can observe that the NSN certainly behaves as SW-NET in the average hamming distance,

unlike in an average path length. Thus we conclude that the NSN is not so small world like as SW-NET but

looks like SW-NET with respect to this new index corresponding to the usual clustering coeﬃcient.

This article is planed as follows. First section is devoted to the Introduction, and we give a brief review

of the swapping network togrther with the constructive deﬁnition that was given in the previous article[10].

In section 3 we give the deﬁnition of the new index, average hamming distance and multiplicity, and compare

it with the clustering coeﬃcient of the well known SW-NET. After that, we evaluate the indeces for NSN and

the preferential NSN [10] to study the properties of the network in more details in the section 4. In the last

section, 5, we give concluding remarks.

2 Node swapping netwark and average path length between nodes

In this section we introduce the NSN by presenting a constructive deﬁnition, and review some properties of

the network that have been discussen in [10].

2.1 Review of node swapping network (NSN)

As explained in the previous section, we consider that nodes swap each other on a regular network. This

network may be seemed to look like a small world network. However, it is necessarily not the case. By the

movement, the nodes and the edges accompanied with them are entirely cut, and the nodes are connected with

new edges each other at the new position. Notice that the network topology is apparently invariant under the

procedure. In small world networks the static properties are only pursured but the dynamic properties such

as NSN are rather important.

The algorithm for formulating the NSN is as follows;

1. Prepare a regular (typically one dimensional) network with a periodic boundary condition such as a ring.

2. Randomly choose two nodes on its network and swap them. This procedure is repeated Q times.

3. Evaluate correct quantities of the network.

4. 1∼3, which is one round, is repeated M times.

In such a way, the network is dynamically analyzed as edges are cut and pasetd to new nodes.

We analyze some properties of the network by doing computer simulations. First of all we discuss the

diameter D and the average distance L between any pairs of nodes of the NSN, which have been given in [10].

The diameter of usual random networks behaves as

log n
log<k> [6], where < k > is the average degree of
nodes and n is the size of network, that is, the number of nodes. We have conveniently introduced a handy

network in [10] with the same properties essentially as random networks, instead of usual random networks.

This new network has been called ”random graph with ﬁxed degree”, RNFD, where the degrees of all nodes

are contrived to be a constant number k.

2

Fig.1 shows the size n vs. D of the NSN constructed from degree k = 4 regular lattice and RNFD with

k = 4, respectively[10]. The points and curved lines in the ﬁgures show simulation data and its approximate

curves, respectively. This shows that n dependence of D in the NSN is exponential, while that in RAFD is

logarithmic such as random networks. Their essential properties are independent of Q in NSN or k in RNFD.
Since the behaviour is linear, D = n

2k , in one dimensional regural lattice with the periodic boundary condition,
it turns out that NSN is a network intermediate between regular lattices and random networks or SW-NET.

The existence of D also means that NSN is an overall connected network.

To clear the point we study average distance L between any pairs of nodes. (Notice that the behaviour of

L is not necessarily equal to that of D in dynamic networks, because the network in calculating the distances

from a target node to nearby nodes is not the same as that in calculating the distance from the target node

to faraway one. Thus L is the average over diﬀerent networks. D is the step number from a target one to

the most faraway node.) Fig.2 shows L-n curves of RNFD with k = 4 and NSN with Q = 10 and k = 4.

Essentially L’s have the same property as D. The reason will be that the number of steps needed for the

complete estimation of D is nearly equal to that of L. The properties are also independent of Q or k. Since a

regular lattice shows linear dependence in L-n relation such as D-n, the NSN is not only so small world and

but also so large world after all. Fig. 3 refers to theoretical L-n curves of SW-NET[7] and SF-NET[8],[9] that

are given by

L(n) =

log(4np)
8p
loge n
loge loge n

(

for 2np >> 1 and SW-NET,
for SF-NET,

(1)

and their numerically approximated curves. p is the rewiring probability in SW-NET, taken p = 0.05 in Fig.3.

In SF-NET, the logarithmic function phenomenologically ﬁts almost perfectly. Though it is also possible that

both of NSN and SF-NET can be approximated by exponential functions, they are very diﬀerent from each

other in the absolute value of the index. This property is essentially invariant under changing Q value. As

we increse Q = 1, 5, 10, ..., the index of the exponential decreses to s = 0.83, 0.62, 0.58, ... in NSN. As for

SF-NET s = 0.07, diﬀerent from those of NEN in order, and it seems not to be able to overcome the diﬀerence

(we should interpret that the excessively small s means that it is rather the logarithmic function).

Thus SF-NET and NSN are essentially thought to be diﬀerent networks in terms of the average path

length. In summary we conclude that the relation

RN F D ∼ SF − N ET < SW − N ET < N SN < Redular lattice

applys in L.

3 Hamming coeﬃcient and clustering coeﬃcient

The clustering coeﬃent and the degree distribution have no signiﬁcance in the NSN, because the network

topology in NSN is apparently invariant temporally so that they take the same values as those of the original

regular lattice. As for this, we may have to introduce a sort of new kind of index to investigate NSN in more

details.

The most eﬀective way would be to explore the propagation of a test virus on dinamic networks. We

adopt the idea, basically. Instead of exploring the similarities of friendship among all nodes connected with

a target node such as the clustering coeﬃcient, we estimate the similarity of friendship between a node i

connected with a target node j and the target node. We measure it by calculating the hamming distance

between adjacent vectors vi and vj where the adjacent vector vi(vj) is the i-th(j-th) row vector in the adjacent

matrix of the network. Then node i is chosen at random among the conected nodes with j, which reﬂects

the situation that a virus randomly infects some node connected with the target node j.

In place of the

usual clustering coeﬃcient, we evaluate the averaged hamming distance DH during the time all nodes will be

infected. Moreore exactly, we introduce the multiplicity M as

M = 1 −

, DH = vi • vj

(where • means the Boolean inner product)

in order to measure a similarity of two nodes, while the hamming distance itself means the diﬀerence of

friendship between two connected nodes. We take Dn = 2k as the normarization factor (The reason will be

given later).

Next we compare the multiplicity to the usual clustering coeﬃcient in well known networks such as the

SW-NET. In Fig. 4 the two indeces in the SW-NET with degree k = 12 and n = 500 are given. The fact that

both act in a similar way suggests that the multiplicity can play the same role as the clustering coeﬃcient.

Of course both indeces are originally deﬀerent ones and so it is not necessary that they take a same value or

behave in same way exactly. The multiplicity is only a substitute for the clustering coeﬃcient. However, it

can play an important role in dynamic networks sucu as NSN as discussed in the next section.

Here we have a little theoretical discussion on DH to speculate the value of Dn. In regular lattice, we

can analytically estimate DH ;

DH =

2i

where k = 2δ. This corresponds to the limit of p → 0 in SW-NET. The fact that DH = δ + 1 = 7 for δ = 6

agrees with Fig.5 where DH = 7.16.

On the other hand, in random lattice, we can estimate DH as an expectation value of the probability

that i-th element in an n bit string, whose component randomly takes 0 or 1, is diﬀerent from i-th one in

another random n bit string. So we obtain

DH = [1 − {(

)2 + (

)2}] × n = 4δ

where the inner parts of { } is the sum of two probabilities that both i-th elements are 0 and that they are 1

together. Lastly n is multiplied to take an average for n bits. Simply we can also evaluate it as the expectation

value of the probability that i-th elements of two random n-bits strings are diﬀerent each other;

DH = 2 × n ×

where n is multiplied to take the average for n bits as before and 2 is multiplied due to the permutaion

symmetry of two n-bit strings. More elaborate derivation will be given in Appendix. This happens at large

p for SW-NET and so DH = 23.8 in the present case with δ = 6 and n = 500, which agrees well with Fig.5

where DH = 22.7.

Anyway 4δ(n−δ)

4 Multiplicity of simple node swapping network and preﬀerencial

node swapping network

In this section, we estimate the multiplicities of NSN and their variation, which will be deﬁned in 4.2, to

analyse network properties in more details.

4.1 Hamming coeﬃcient of simple node swapping network

In this section we evaluate new index, the hamming distance, for NSN. For it, we need a little extension of the

index so that it adapts in dynamic networks. In dynamic networks, we deﬁne the incoming edges as the edges

that a target node i leaves, and the outgoing edges as those that the node h infected from the node i leaves.

When no swapping happens, the index can be obtained by calculating vi • vh. However, notice that when the

infected node h is swapped, outgoing edges are diﬀerent from those without swapping beacause of rewiring

eﬀect. When the infected node h is swapped, the outgoing edges are those that the infected node gets at the

new position. Then the hamming distance turns to the Boolean inner product betweem the target node i and

the node j that is swapped with the node h connected with i, that is vi • vj, ultimately. Thus we evaluate it

for NSN and the preferential NSN, which will be explained in the successive subsection.

4.2 Multiplicities of simple and preferrencial node swapping network

First of all we explain a variation of the NSN. There are a little similarity between the NSN and SF-NET

apparently as suggested before. We pursue this point still more. Scale free property usually appears from

both of the evolution and the preferential attachment. We apply the idea of the preferential attachment to

this dynamic NSN. We assume that the nodes which has been transferred once are also transferred with high

propability after that. At m round and q times, the probability pi(t) that a node i is chosen as a swapping

node is assumed that

where

pi(t) =

1+pi(t−1)N (t−1)
N (t−1)+2

when the node i was chosen as exchange node at time t − 1 ,
others,

(7)

N (t) = n + 2t,

t = mQ + q,

pi(0) =

for all i.

This reﬂects the fact that while active people often transfer, others trend to stay in one place. We call this type

of networks Preferential Node Swapping Network (PNSN). On the other hand, NSN introduced in the previous

subsection is called simple NSN when we need to distinguish them. The results of computer simulation of L

and D on PNSN are just similar to those of the NEN [10].

Fig. 6 shows the multiplicity of the simple NSN and PNSN with k = 4, n = 500 and Q = 5. More

simulations will prove that changing Q does not have any crucial eﬀects in the multiplicity. We can observe

that the behaviour of NSN is the almost same as that of simple NSN. So it seems that there is not preferential

eﬀect in NSN, even when swapping increases in a number of times, which corresponds to large p.

From Fig.4 and Fig.6 where the multiplicity showly drops oﬀ in the similar manner as SW-NET, we can

observe that the behaviour of (P)NSN looks like that of SW-NET in M . This means that NSN is deﬁnitely

diﬀerent from SF-NET.

5 Concluding Remarks

We introduced a new index for dynamic networks to analyze them, especially NSN or PSNS, in more details.

It has been shown that this index, multiplicity, can stand in for the usual clustering coeﬃcient in the SW-NET.

Using this fact, we analyse the simple NSN and the PNSN. These behaviours look like SW-NET in the point

of view of the new index, M . Considering the results of analyses of the diameters and the average path length

given in [10], we entirely obtain three main conclusions. One is that NSN is not so small world as SW-NET

and SF-NET, but a little more small world than regular lattice networks, and thus NSN is something between

regural networks and SW-NET. Second one is that (P)NSN shows similar behabiours as SW-NET in the

multiplicity. Third is that there is not any crucial preferential eﬀects in NSN.

They are summarized with other well-known networks in Table 1 where the multiplicity in exchange for

C is shown for (P)NSN. The properties of L and C of all networks that have already known currently [11]

are included in the Table 1 except for (P)NSN. For example, the properties of complete graphs are essentially

the same as those of SW-NET with respect to L and C, and so on. By contrast, (P)NSN are diﬀerent from

every one of them that have already known. Moreover as p → large, L increases and the M corresponding

to C decreases in (P)NSN. By taking large p, a network with large L and small M (C) may be constructed,

which has quire novel property. To study some dynamics of NSN with these properties will be next intersting

works[12].

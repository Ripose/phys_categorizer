Abstract:    The  Clausius  inequality  for  closed  systems  was    deduced  from    the  Riemann 
integration  of  closed  Carnot  cycle  loops  for  irreversible  transitions.  The  corresponding 
inequalities  for  the  recently  developed  open  system  Carnot  cycles      are  derived  here  and  their 
properties indicate that no  new nonequilibrium entropy results from them  as has  been proposed 
over  the  decades.  It  is  proven    that  a  sequence  of    points  along  a  non-equilibrium  state  space 
must have excess variables augmenting those for the equilibrium situation, thereby proving that 
the Principle of Local Equilibrium (PLE) used extensively to describe nonequilibrium systems is 
only  an  approximation.  To  demonstrate  the  breakdown  of  the  Principle,  verification  of  the 
theorem,  and  the  presence  of  new  phenomena,  an  ab  initio  steady  state  simulation  of  a  simple 
A↔   under  nonequilibrium  conditions  was  performed  and  the  results 
dimer  reaction 
compared to the equilibrium conditions to show the regime of breakdown of the Principle. The 
novel dimer reaction presented has  a   cyclical pathway found in many natural processes, such as 
laser  photochemistry.  It  is  suggested  that  such  reaction  pathways    can  exist  and  awaits 
experimental verification.  A new algorithm to conserve momentum and energy at the potential 
switches of the dimer  is applied effectively. New atomic and molecular flux flows not present 
under equilibrium conditions are shown to exist, where the net rate of reaction along the cell is 
not zero but small, unlike the zero rate   equilibrium requirement, leading to the flux presence. 
The equilibrium constant is also shifted from the value at thermodynamical equilibrium. Unless 
reinterpreted differently, it is shown that the so-called Curie symmetry principle, fundamental in 
deciding on  the feasibility of flux-force couplings in both theory and experiment in all physical 
theories,   cannot apply to such  experimental results. Hence, a far greater freedom in selecting 
appropriate  force-flux  couplings  is  indicated  than  would  be  the  case  if  the  Curie  principle,  as 
commonly interpreted   is adopted.

quantities measured at the system during system transitions. 
 
The  traditional  Clausius  Inequality    was  derived    using  some  of  the  following  well  founded 
Axioms, which will be adhered to here. 
 
Axiom 1.   (Kelvin-Clausius) It is impossible to construct an engine working in a cycle, which 
will produce no other effect than the transfer of heat from a cooler body to a hotter one. 
 
Axiom 2. (Riemann summation) The  Σ  variables vary continuously in the system transitions and 
are differentiable and  in particular the  m variables vary  continuously  even within a single open 
Carnot loop  j  which is an element in the Riemann sum, so that no finite instances of  measured 
mass injections/extractions can occur for any  j  loop. 
 
Axiom  3.  (First  Law  )  The    energy  functions  have  perfect  total  derivatives  i.e.  they  are    state 
functions. 
 
Axiom  4.  (Clausius  inequality  assumption)  Irreversible  pathways  traverse  a  pathway    along  a 
sequence of points  exactly that of  a reversible pathway where the  Σ  variables are concerned in 
an arbitrary circular, but yield different  diathermal heat absorption increments for each element j 
of  the  Riemann summation. 
 
Remark 1. If the above did not obtain, it would be impossible to form Riemann sums correlating 
a  reversible  and  irreversible  Carnot  cycle  about  an  infinitesimally  small  loop  to  deduce  the 
Clausius inequality.

It is noted that two types of Clausius inequalities are derived, where the heat term in Theorem 5 
is local. The above results contradicts Bhalekar’s proof [2 a]  that the inequality does not exist 
for open systems  and also to an extent the rebuttal [2 b] since no heat terms are discriminated 
here and no proven state functions were apparently derived.

S of  Theorem  2.  There 
have been attempts by a tradition set by Eu [3 a-j] and others [4 a-c]  over the last two decades to 
derive  a  new  entropy  form  based  on  heat  compensation  from  the  Clausius  inequality  with 
supposed applications  despite not having a proper characterization of the heat  terms used for the 
Clausius inequalities, and  of the entropy forms. Most irreversible systems are open in nature, but 
the theorem was derived initially using the traditional closed Clausius loop, and later with Gibbs’ 
thermodynamical assumptions. A proof  for closed systems  that these new entropy forms cannot 
obtain was provided recently [5],  and since the mathematical structure of both open and closed 
systems are the same as shown above, the results given in [5]  may be generalized for the 2  q

2.2 Considerations in principle of local equilibrium (PLE) 
This principle [p.23; 6 a: p.7; 6 b: p.7, 6 c] states that  a nonequilibirum  steady state system may 
be locally described  by variables that describe an equilibrium system, and that the heat transfer 
and  other  flux  terms  arise  from  the  gradients  in  the  equilibrium  variables  across  the  entire 
system.  Some  have  suggested  this  principle  to  be  very  strong  on  the  basis  of  a  restricted 
simulation  and  other    studies  of  particles  with  an  interparticle  potential  [7  a-c]  .    Theorem  7 
below  shows  that  there are  augmenting variables  to irreversible  systems    without  contradicting  
Axiom 4, which is used to derive the theorem. Implications are then discussed.  
 
Theorem  7.  ∃   an  infinite  number  of  irreversible  heat  pathways

of intersection is defined to belong to just one of either the molecular or atomic  potential curves 
and not both. Total energy is conserved since the curves cross, and uncertainties can only be due 
to the finite time step per cycle in the Verlet leap frog algorithm. The molecule interacts with its

resemblance  to  the  charge  neutralization  reaction 
  [Fig.6.60,  pp.375-376;    10] 
except  that  the  discussion  does  not  explicitly  mention  the  crossing  over  of  the  KI  and  K+I-  
potentials  at  short  distances  (high  energy),  although  there  is  reason  to  suppose  such  processes 
can occur, since the KI potential curve exists at small distances well before the crossover point. 
We  conjecture  that  the  reluctance  of  experts  may  be  due  in  part  to  the  influence  of  “time-
reversibility”  concepts  [9]  and  this  simulation  serves  to  both  predict  and    challenge 
experimentalists to verify the existence of such reaction mechanisms. The current molecule does 
not  violate  any  dynamical  or  thermodynamical    principle  and  hence  can  be  used  to  verify  the

This  new  algorithm  coupled  with  shorter  time  step  ensured  excellent  thermostatting  of  the 
system for equilibrium runs without having to thermostat each layer (64 in all) but only the ends 
of  the  cell  to  ensure  uniform  temperature  throughout  the  cell;  there  was  no  reason  to  use  this 
algorithm in the previous study [8] because a low temperature decay of the molecules only was

Figure 3.  Presence of  a bi-directional compensating flux observed at one edge of the cell. 
 
Fig. 3 shows  fluxes (very faintly observed in Case 1, but the effect is less than the uncertainty of 
error, and although the result is not random and is also systematic, it will not be presented since 
it may still be an artifact of the errors due to simulation) that are bidirectional and compensating 
, but which becomes acute near the molecular sources located 
starting at approximately 
).  Since  dimers  are  formed  (by  a  hypothetical 
at  the    high  temperature  reservoir    ( 50

catalyst)    if  they  are  within  the  range  of    molecular  internuclear  distances,  there  is  a  constant 
replenishment  of  the  monomer,  leading  to  a  positive  flux;  the  excess  production  leads  to  a

Curie principle as commonly understood [pp.36,194,218;  6  b] which states that “in (an isotropic 
system) there may not be coupling between scalar and vectorial quantities” leading to the setting 
to zero any cross-coupling coefficients between these terms [eq. 3.19,p.26;6 b] requires scrutiny. 
(Needless to mention perhaps, it is hard to imagine an isotropic system with long-range non-zero 
vectorial  quantities!).  In  some  treatises  [eq.47-48,  p.21;  6  c]  it  is  generally  stated  that  “the 
coupling between  any vectorial  and  scalar  process vanishes”  due  to the  principle, which  is  the 
basis in constructing equations that couple/decouple flow quantities for non-equilibrium systems, 
studies and simulations. In fact the methodology  is detailed, refined, entertaining no exceptions 
[p.5  eqs.14-21,p.33-55;  6  a]  when  setting  to  zero  these  cross-coefficients  between  vectors  and 
scalars.  
In  a  recent  mesoscopic  rendering  [7  b],  the  ambiguous  Gibbsian  equations  [1]  was  utilized  to 
model “far from equilibrium” situations, thereby presuming the validity of PLE in these regimes, 
in contrast to Theorem 7 and the simulation results. This tendency is affirmed in a related work 
by  the  remark:  “The  surprising  finding  is  that  we  shall  need  the  assumption  of  local 
electrochemical  equilibrium  in  the  reaction  coordinate  space”  [p.13471;  7  d].  Indeed,  the

thermodynamics”  specifically refers there  to the PLE adhering, linear theory described in [6 a]. 
 
3. Summary 
 
The above theorems on Clausius inequality and principle of correlation corroborated by NEMD 
shows that  ∆  variables must feature in any reasonable and logical far-from-equilibrium theory. 
The century of research which decoupled scalar fluxes and vectorial or tensorial forces due to the 
Curie  principle  must  be  revised  for  far-from-equilibrium  theories  where  the  PLE  is  no  longer 
valid. A novel hysteresis-loop reaction model awaiting experimental verification was employed 
for  the  NEMD  portion,  which  employed  a  new  switching  algorithm  with  energy-momentum 
conservation which can be used to model more conventional molecules.

Abstract

This  paper presents  the  physical  background  for 
particle extraction from IHEP accelerator using short bent
silicon  crystals,  analyses  the  results  of  the  studies,
considers  in  detail  the  regime  of  simultaneous work  of 
crystal  extraction  and  several  internal  targets.  It  is 
experimentally shown that the use of short crystals allows
intensity  of  ~1012
the  extraction  of  beams  with 
proton/cycle with efficiency of ~85%.

INTRODUCTION

Over  a  period  of  almost 

thirty  years,  several
laboratories  around  the  world  have  developed  a  new
method of  steering  high-energy  particle  beams,  based on
the  use  of  bent  crystals.  Employing  this  technique,  the
first extracted charged particle beams were obtained with
a moderate  intensity  of  up  to  107  particles  per  pulse  at 
extraction  efficiencies  of  10-4-10-3.  In 1989,  at  the  IHEP
U-70 accelerator, a proton beam with energies of 50 and
70 Gev was  extracted  into  one  of  the  existing  channels.
To direct  the extracted  beam into  this  channel,  it  was
necessary to bent a (111) silicon crystal 65*15*0.6 mm in
size  to  a  large  angle,  (cid:97)85  mrad. To  increase  the
extraction  efficiency,  one  has  to  employ  short 
crystals  bent  at  small  angle.  In  this  case,  as
calculations  for 
the  IHEP  accelerator  showed, 
crystals with a 1-2 mm length and bending angles of
1-2  mrad  can  provide  particle  extraction  with  an
efficiency  of  (cid:97)85%.  The  development  of  such  an
extraction  for  the  IHEP  accelerator was  started  in
1997 and mostly completed by the end of 2001.

EXTRACTION SCHEMES AT THE IHEP
PROTON ACCELERATOR
The moderate extraction efficiency in experiments
with  long  crystals  was  caused  by  the  fact  that 
particles  are  captured  into  the  channeling  regime 
mostly  during  the  first  passage  through  the  crystal.
Particles not captured into the channeling regime are
strongly  scattered  and  are  eventually  lost.  To  attain
efficient multipass  extraction,  when  particles  not 
captured  during  the  first  passage  can be  captured 
during  subsequent  passages,  short-length  crystals
with  small  bending  angles  are  required.  In  this
circumstance,  the  efficiency  of  particle  capture  into 
the  channeling  regime  can  be  estimated  from  the 

following  considerations:  as  a  rule,  a  regular 
structure of the crystal surface layer 10-30 (cid:80)m thick
is  disturbed  during  its  treatment.  Particles  passing 
through  this  layer  will  be  subject  to  multiple
Coulomb  scattering,  and  a  fraction  of  the  beam  is 
lost  as  a  result  of  nuclear  interactions.  At  the  next 
encounter  with  the  crystal,  this  time  in  its  regular 
region,  the  beam  at  the  entrance  face  will  have  the 
distribution  with  the  root-means-square  angle  given

The  proton extraction  efficiency  calculated  using 
formulas (2) and (3) is shown in Fig.1. These calculations 
carried  out  for  (110)  silicon crystals  of various  lengths,
deflecting  a  70-Gev  proton  beam  at  a  fixed  angle  of
2 mrad.

The results  of  direct  numerical  simulation  (closed
squares)  are also  shown  there.  The  difference  in  the
results for short crystal lengths is due to the fact that the
future of  the dechanneled particles  is  disregarded  in  the
calculations  using  formula  (3)  in  contrast  to  numerical
simulation.  However,  a  certain  fraction of  dechanneled
particles that passed through most of the crystal length in
the channeling mode can also be removed.

We  can  see  in  Fig.1  that  multipass  extraction  yields
threefold  extraction  efficiency  in  comparison with one-
pass extraction. In this case, short crystals (cid:97)1-2 mm long,
provide the highest efficiency ((cid:97)80%). As for restrictions
on crystal thickness, they are rather vague. As estimations
show,  crystals  0.3-0.6  mm  thick  can be  used  without  a 
significant influence on efficiency.

Since the crystal structure in the surface layer is, as a rule,

hich  should be  considered in  the development  of beam
extraction using  bent  crystals:  As  we  saw,  to  attain 
efficient extraction, the deflection angle (cid:300) of the particles
caused  by  the  crystal  should  be  small.  Therefore,  beam
extraction from the accelerator requires the installation of 
additional deflecting  magnets  at  the deflected  beam
trajectory.  The  relative  positions of  the  crystal  and  the

first  magnet should be  such  that  the  extracted  beam
arrives at the magnet operating aperture.

The  accelerated beam  can  be steered onto  the  crystal,
e.g., by controlled local distortion of the closed orbit (the
so-called  bump).  To  this  end,  in  the  simplest  case,  it  is 
required  that  two  magnetic  units of  the  accelerator  are
used, placed at a distance of half a wavelength of betatron
oscillations from  each  other. Using  additional  coils,  a
magnetic  field  perturbation (cid:507)B  is  induced  in  the  first
magnetic unit, which increases during beam guidance. As
a  rule,  the magnetic  unit  length  in  strong-focusing
accelerator  is much  shorter than the  wavelengths  of 
betatron oscillations, and the effect of the perturbing field
(cid:507)B  is  reduced  to  a  change  in  the  orbit  angle  at  the

It  follows from  Eq.(9)  that as  the  bump  increases,  its 

guidance angle to crystal proportionally
varies. As a result, an increasing mismatch arises between
the  angular position of  the  crystal  and  the beam
(seeFig.3),  which  eventually  decreases  the  extraction
efficiency

In  an  operating  accelerator,  these  conditions  are
difficult to meet, since the position where crystals would
be  installed  are  usually  occupied by  other system.  In  the
simplest  example,  the  mismatch  in  the  angle, when  the
beam is completely guided to the crystal, is given by

where xmax  is  half  the  beam  size.  In  order  that  the
extraction efficiency is unchanged during beam guidance,
(cid:39) (cid:99)(cid:3)x

max should not exceed the Lindhard angle.
As  the  accelerated  beam  is  deflected by  the  crystal  at 
small  angles  (1-2  mrad),  its  direct  extraction from  the 
accelerator is impossible due to the short straight sections. 
Therefore,  it  was  also  necessary  to  use  several  septum
magnets from the existing extraction system.

Three  single-type  stations  with  bent  crystals  Si19,  Si22
and  Si106, were  installed  in  various places  in  the 
accelerator (see  Fig.4).  The  subscript  means  the  straight
section  index or  the  index of a  magnet  in which  the
crystal is installed. Each station can provide proton beam
extraction  toward  an  existing  extraction channel  at  a
corresponding of bumps.

Fig.5)  is  successfully  carried out. Using another  station
Si22,  placed  at the  center of magnetic unit no.22, protons
were  extracted  through  the  septum magnets  SM24  and
SM26 (curve  3  in  Fig.5).  In  this  case,  the  beam  was 
guided  using another  two  pairs  of  magnetic  unit. When
operating  with  the  third  station Si106  installed  in  straight
section  no.106  (not  shown  in  Fig.5),  the beam  was  also
guided to the crystal using two pair of magnetic units: one
in  the  feedback  mode  and  another  in  the dc  mode.  The
beam  was  extracted  through  the  septum magnets  SM20,
22  and  26  and  the  septum  magnets  SM24  and  SM26.
Thus,  the  third  scheme,  in  the  case  of  faults  in  the  first 
two, can replace either of them.

Apart  from  these  station Si30,  Si84  and  Si86  were  also
placed  in  the  accelerator.  Crystalline  station  Si30  is 
intended  to remove  a  small  fraction of particles  (~107
protons)  extracted  toward beam  channel  no.8  and  to 
deflect  them  into  channel no.22 (the deflection  angle  is
~9 mrad).  Crystalline  stations  Si84  and  Si86  are  placed  in 
the  test  region  and  are  intended  to  test  crystals  before
their installation in the workstations Si19, Si22 and Si106, as 
well  as  to  carry  out  studies  into,  in particular  beam
collimation modes  using  bent  crystals.  Let  us  enlarge  on
the chosen schemes of accelerator beam extraction using
bent  crystals. Figure 5  shows  two of  these  extraction
schemes.  In  one  scheme,  crystalline  station  Si19,  which
has two crystals (one is a reserve), is installed in straight
section no.19. It provides independent movement of each
crystal  along  the  radius,  as  well  as  changing  its  angular
orientation with respect to the beam. The beam is guided
to  the  crystal  by  a  local distortion of  the orbit  using  two 
pairs of magnetic units. Particles guided to the crystal and
captured  into  the  channeling regime  are  deflected  by  the 
crystal  at  an  angle  of (cid:97)1.7-2.5  mrad  (depending on  the
crystal bending angle) and arrive at the aperture of septum
magnet  SM20,  avoiding  a  septum.  After  being  deflected
by  the  septum magnets  SM22  and  SM26 (curve 2  in
Fig.5), particles are removed from the accelerator vacuum
chamber  in  the  30th  straight  section.  This  scheme  is
attractive because simultaneous beam extraction using the
crystal  and  two  internal  targets  T24  and T27 (curve  1  in

during its simultaneous guidance onto the crystal in
straight section no.19 (Si) and internal target T24 and
T27, (2) the trajectory of beam extraction from crystal 
SS-19 (Si), and (3) the trajectory of beam extraction from
crystal Unit 22 (Si). 

Table 1 lists the values of the structural functions (cid:302) and 
(cid:533) of the U-70 accelerator for positions of the crystals and 
the first septum magnets, as well as the phase increments
between  them.  Table  1  also  lists  the  distances x2

circulating  beams  for  a  crystal  with  the bending  angle

mm at the entrance of the first septum magnets.

We  can  see  from  Table  1  that  the  beam  separation  is
sufficient to inject the extracted beam into the aperture of 
the  first  septum magnets.  Moreover, when  extracting  the
beam  according  to  schemes Si106-24-26  or  20-22-26,  as
well  as  Si22-24-26,  crystals  with  bending  angles  of

3. THE CRYSTAL TYPES USED.

To  implement  the  above-considered  schemes  of 
proton beam  extraction,  it  was  necessary  to  solve  the 
very complex problem of bending short silicon crystals 
at small angles. At the Institute of Nuclear Physics, an
O-shaped  crystal  was  developed, which  consisted  of
two U-shaped  crystals  joined  by legs  (Fig.6). This
technique  has  been  employed at  the  first  stage  of  our
experiments. In this design, the leg thickness is 1 mm.
The crystal working  region  (1)  5*5*0.6 mm3  (length
along  the  beam,  height,  and  thickness)  was  bent  at  a 
small region (2) using a special device.

Figure  6:  A  schematic  representation  of  the  O-crystal
(1)  working  region  and  (2)  compressing device
position.

A  further  increase  in  the  extraction  efficiency  is
required to eliminate leg material in the beam path. To 
this end, a new method for bending a crystal shaped in
the  form  of  a  narrow  strip (cid:97)2  mm in  length  along  the
beam  and  30-40  mm  in  height (S-crystal)  has  been
developed.  The  method  is based  on  the anisotropic
properties of lattices, (Fig.7).

Specifically,  such  strip-shaped  crystals,  (cid:97)2  mm  in
length  along  the  beam  and  subjected  to  special
chemical  polishing,  showed the  best  beam  extraction 
efficiency: (cid:97)85%. A  general  view  of  the  bending
device, with a strip-shaped crystal, is shown in Fig. 8.

To apply bent crystals as devises for beam extraction 
from  the  accelerator,  so-called  crystalline  deflector
stations,  and their  control system,  were  developed.
Currently, eight stations are installed at the accelerator.
A typical station has two independent mechanisms to
move  two  crystals  in  the  horizontal  plane.  The
precision  of  crystals  positioning  with  respect  to  the
equilibrium orbit is (cid:97)0.1 mm. The crystal is positioned
at  an  angle with  respect  to  the  beam  guided  to  the
crystal  using angular  displacement  mechanism  based
on  electric  step motors. The  angular  positioning
precision is (cid:97)13.5 µrad.

Crystalline stations themselves, after being mounted
in the accelerator, become a part of vacuum volume of 
the  accelerator.  Therefore,  their  structure  is  designed
for an operating vacuum of 10-7 Torr.

4. DIAGNOSTICS OF THE BEAM 
EXTRACTED BY A BENT CRYSTAL.

The controlled parameters of the extracted beam are 
its  intensity, measured within  109-1012  protons  per
spill, the extraction efficiency, the spill time structure;
the  beam  geometry,  at  most  interesting points  of  the
loss during
the 
extraction  path,  and 
extraction. The latter characteristic is not a direct beam
parameter,  however,  it  is  important  for  optimizing  the 
steering  conditions  and  also  in various  studies.  Figure
10  shows  the layout  of  the beam  diagnostic  devices
when operating with  the  crystals  installed in  straight
sections no.106 and 19 of the U-70 accelerator.

When operating with these crystals, beam extraction

this happens, 

The intensity during the beam spill time is multiply
measured.  This  allows  measurement  of  the  spill  time
structure  in  a  frequency band up  to 600  Hz. An
acceptable  measure  accuracy  of  the  total  intensity  of 
the  extracted beam  can  be  attained  only  after  SEC
calibration by a more  precise  instrument  in  the  same
beam.

(SEC30) 

The  secondary  emission  chamber 

is
intended to measure the intensity of the beam extracted
by  the  crystal.  To  measure  the  intensity  of  the
circulating beam  steered  onto  the  crystal,  and  to 
determine the extraction efficiency, a circulating beam
is  used. The  extracted  beam
transformer  (CBT) 
transformer  (EBT),  is  placed  near  the  SEC30  to
measure the beam intensity during fast extraction. It is
used to calibrate the SEC30.

The  extraction  efficiency  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of 
the extracted beam intensity, measured using the SEC, 
to  that  of  the  intensity  of the  beam  guided  to  the
crystal, measured using the CBT. The accuracy of the
latter is about 1%; thus, the accuracy of the extraction
efficiency calculation is defined only by the SEC error
and  does  not  exceed  4%  in  range of  109-1012  protons
per spill.

An  advantage of  the  SEC  is  its  linear  response  in  a 
wide  range  of  beam intensities,  as  well  as  its  high-
speed performance.  To  increase  the  sensitivity,  a 
combination of several emitters is used.

Several radiation monitors (RM) along the extraction
path  make  it possible  to  measure  the beam  losses  in
space  and  time  at  the  partitions  of  deflecting  magnets
or on vacuum chamber walls.

When optimizing  extraction  with  bent  crystals, 
losses  are  measured using  two  independent  systems
integrated  into  the  U-70  control  system.  Ionization
chambers  with  air  filling  are  used  in  these systems  as
sensors. One system continuously monitors losses over
the  entire  U-70  ring.  Another  an  independent  system 
has  sixteen  monitors  are  placed  in  the  extraction  path
and head  the regions of  the  transport  channels.  The
system provides multiple measurements of losses over
the extraction time with a resolution of 10 ms.

the  monitors are  equipped with drivers  and  can be

To make the proton beam guidance uniform, and to
measure  the  relative  intensity  of  the  proton  beam

spilled  onto crystals,  feedback  systems  based on
scintillation detectors were developed. They consist of
two  monitors  each,  installed  at  the  orbit  level  and 
placed 6-20 m from the crystals. 

The monitors include FEU-93 photomultipliers with
(p-  terphenyl)  scintillators. Their  radiation  resistance
means that they can be operated for two years without
appreciable  deterioration  of  their  parameters.  One
monitor is the feedback monitor (FM); the other is for
measuring relative intensity.

The  signal  from  the  relative  intensity  monitor  is 
proportional to a beam fraction, which initiates nuclear
reactions in the crystal material. The signal is lowest at
an  angular  crystal  position,  and  this  feature  is  used
when tuning the extraction conditions.

The  set  of  diagnostic  devices  considered  above,  is
not  complete. When  tuning  the  channeling conditions
and optimizing  the  extraction  channel,  both  a  TV 
system and scintillation detectors are used.

The  main  advantages  of  such  systems  are  simple
implementation,  a  high  threshold  sensitivity,  and  a

5. CONDITIONS OF PROTON BEAM
EXTRACTION WITH BENT CRYSTALS.
Proton  beam  extraction  was  studied  mostly  at
energies  of  70 and  50  GeV  using strip-shaped (111)
crystals  (S-type)  and  (110) O-crystals  (O-type).  The
crystal characteristics and the highest attained values of
the  extraction efficiency  are listed  in  Table  4.  During
the  experiment,  the  accelerated  beam  intensity  was
(0.5-5)*1012 protons per pulse.

When the crystal began to operate in the channeling
regime,  its  position was varied  over  angle.  Figure 12
shows the typical orientation curve for 70-GeV protons
extracted  according  to  scheme  106-24-26  using  an  S-
crystal no.1 (see Table 4). The operating position of the
crystal corresponds to the curve maximum.

The  extraction  efficiency  (the  ratio  of  the  extracted
beam intensity to that of the intensity fraction guided to
the  crystal)  was  determined  by  the  acquisition  of 
statistical  data  during  several  hundred  cycles.  The 
measured  and  calculated  (using  available  codes) 
extraction  efficiencies  in  relation  to  the  intensity
fraction guided  to  the  crystal  at  an  energy of  70 GeV
are shown in Fig.13, for extraction schemes 106-24-26
(Fig.13a) and 22-24-26 (Fig.13b).

increases.  This  is  caused by  the  guidance angle drift
in a  non-optimal  angular
(see  Sec.3)
orientation of the crystal with respect to the beam. The
calculated curve (dashed line) is 3-5% higher than the
experimental one,  which  indicates  their satisfactory
agreement.

For  extraction  according 

to  scheme  22-24-26 
(Fig.16b), a certain increase ((cid:97)4%) in the efficiency is 
observed  as  the beam  fraction  guided  to  the  crystal
increases,  This  can  be  explained by  assuming  that  the 
beam of unchanneled particles x partially arrives at the
septum  of  the  septum magnet  in  the  first moment,
hence,  a  certain  beam  fraction  is  lost.  As  the  beam
emittance  decreases  during  extraction,  these  loses  are
lowered and  the  efficiency  increases. A  simulation  of 
this  process  shoes  that  the  experimentally  observed
dependence agrees well with the calculated one when a
certain  fraction of  the unchanneled beam  is  incident
onto a septum edge 0.3 mm deep (dashed curve 2). If a

Fig. 14 Diagrams of (a) the intensity and (b) the efficiency of the 50 GeV proton beam extraction according to scheme
22-24-26.

Figure 14 illustrate reasonably stable operation of the
extraction  system  in  a  certain  time  interval  of 180
operation  cycles  of  the  accelerator.  The extraction
efficiency at an energy of 50 GeV reaches 80% and the
extracted beam intensity is 1012protons per pulse.

An  important  problem  when  applying crystals  in
accelerators  is  the  radiation  resistance.  The  critical 
particle  flux, which  the  crystal  can  withstand,  was 
experimentally  estimated  at  the  CERN  and  BNL  as
(cid:97)2*1020 protons per sm2. Our experience showed that a 
crystal with an efficiency of 80-85% reliably allows the
extraction  of  beams  with  an  intensity  of  up  to  1012
particles  per  pulse  and  a  duration  of  1-2  seconds per
pulse, over more than two runs for 1400 hours each. 

6. SIMULTANEOUS OPERATION OF PROTON
BEAM EXTRACTION USING A BENT
CRYSTAL AND TWO INTERNAL TARGETS.
Proton beam extraction using bent crystals allows the
simultaneous operation  of  several  internal  targets,
which  was  experimentally  confirmed  at  the  U-70
accelerator.  Implementation  of  this  mode  opens up
possibilities  for  the  simultaneous  operation  of  several
experimental  setups on the  entire  flattop of  the
accelerator  magnetic  cycle,  which  significantly  reduce
the  costs of experiments.  We  should note  that  the

classical  resonant  slow  extraction  is  not  compatible
with the simultaneous operation of internal targets.

To 

implement 

the  mode  where 

the  extraction
operation with crystal and the internal targets operation
are  performed  simultaneously,  an  extraction  scheme
with a crystalline station placed in straight section no.
19 (see  Fig.4, Section  I) was used.  The  proton  beam
was extracted using silicon crystals 5 mm long with a 
bending angle of from 1.7 to 2.3 mrad. Their efficiency
reached (cid:97)60%.  To guide  the  accelerated  beam  to  the

positioned, respectively, in the 24th and 27th magnetic
units  of  the  accelerator,  it  was  necessary  to  cause  a 
local  orbit  distortion  of  a  particular  shape (curve1  in
Fig.4; the extracted beam path is curve 2). The system 
of  local  orbit  distortion  included  three  pairs of
magnetic  units  from  the  U-70 accelerator.  The  beam 
guidance  to  the  crystal  and  internal  targets,  as  well  as 
the  maintenance  of  the regularity  of  the  process,  was 
provided by three beam feedback systems.

internal 

Implementing  the  extraction operation  using  a  bent
crystal simultaneously with internal targets required an 
increase  in  the  number  of  control  tools  for  the 
operation of extraction systems. One of the problems is
that  it  is  impossible  to  measure  partial  intensities
during the simultaneous  operation  of  several  users.
Furthermore, if the intensity consumed by the internal

target  is  estimated  using the  so-called  integrated
monitors,  whose  signal  is  defined  by the  nuclear
interaction  of  the proton beam  with  the  target’s
material, this technique is inapplicable to the crystal. If 
the beam is extracted by the crystal, this signal depends
not only on the spilled intensity, but also on the crystal 
orientation with respect  to  the  incident beam,  i.e.,  on
the extraction efficiency.

To  reliably  measure  the  crystal  operation  efficiency
under  such  conditions,  the minimum  set  of  monitored
parameters should be as follows:

(i)
(ii)

the circulating beam intensity before extraction;
the  total  consumed  intensity,  or  the  difference
between the accelerated intensity and the residue;
(iii) the  intensity  extracted by  the  crystal  in  the  head
region  the  transport  channel  and  in  the  30th
straight section;
the signal of all the integrated monitors;
the  photomultiplier  high  voltages  providing
operation of the beam feedback systems.

as  the  total  consumed  beam intensity,  on  the  beam
intensity extracted by the crystal are shown in Fig.15.

The  difference  between 

the  accelerated  and 
consumed  intensity  is  explained by  the  fact  that  it  is 
expedient  to have  a  certain  (up  to  20%)  reserve of
intensity to maintain long-term stable operation for the
users.  During this  experiment,  we  gradually  increased
the  beam  intensity  extracted  by  the  crystal.  We found
that  beam  intensity  consumed  by  the  internal  targets
was not  changed.  Thus,  the  overall  increase  in  the 
the  crystal 
consumed 
operation.  By  determining  the  ratio  of  the  extracted
intensity  increment  to  that  of  the  consumed  intensity
increment  from this  curve,  we  obtain  a  crystal
operation  efficiency,  in  this  experiment,  equal  to 
(cid:97)45%. In  this  case,  it  was  unchanged  as  the  extracted
intensity increased twofold.

The efficiency of using the extracted proton beam in 
the  experimental  setup,  in  many  respects,  depends  on
the stability of the beam position on the external target
and the beam size stability. As the experiment showed, 
in  the  case  under  consideration,  the  major  causes  of 
these parameters are changes in the current cycle of all 
the  systems maintaining  the  beam  guidance  to  the
crystal and internal targets, as well as the instability of
these  currents  from  cycle  to  cycle.  The  current
oscillogram in one of the guidance systems is shown in 
Fig. 16 (beam 2), as well as the intensity signal of the
beam  circulating  in  the  accelerator  (beam 1),  and  the
signal of the crystal feedback monitor (beam 3). 

The  main  operational  characteristics  for  physical

setups during the first three runs are listed in Table 5.

It  is  impossible  to  directly measure  the  crystal 
efficiency under  conditions of  simultaneous  operation
with  the  internal  targets. Therefore,  to  estimate  the
efficiency  under  these  circumstances,  one  should  use
information  from the  integrated  monitors  employed  in
the  beam  steering  onto  internal  targets.  By  changing
the  extracted  intensity  fraction  while  retaining  the
conditions of beam  guidance  to  the  targets, one  can
evaluate 
the  crystal’s  operation  efficiency.  An
illustration  to  this  is  the experimentally  measured
dependences of the accelerated beam intensity, as well

In these runs, the “Tagged Neutrino Facility” (TVF) 
positioned  in  channel  23 operated using  the beam
extracted by  crystal  (see  Fig.5).  To  make  this  system
operate, a high intensity of the extracted beam with the
longest duration  was  required. Such  requirements
could  not  be met  previously  unless  the  extraction
occurred using crystal. Table 5 shows that the average
beam  intensity  extracted  to  the  setup  increased  from
run to run. It is imported to the efficiency of the use of 
the accelerated beam more than doubled.

The TNF was used to study three-particle decays of 
K±  mesons:  K+ (cid:314)(cid:652)  +(cid:652)  0(cid:652)0,  K-(cid:314)(cid:652)  -(cid:652)o(cid:652)0.  Since  the 
K+  meson  yield  is  significantly  higher  than  the  K-
meson  yield, one  should  proportionally  increase or
decrease the  extracted  proton beam  intensity  when
changing the conditions. To provide such conditions, a 
technique  for  changing  the operating  voltage  of  the
feedback monitor responsible for beam guidance to the
crystal was used (see Fig.17). We can clearly see from
this  figure  that  there  is  good  agreement  between  the
change  in  the secondary  particle  intensity  (I23)  in  the
experimental setup and readings (S19) of the integrated
monitor  displaying  the  proton beam  flux onto  the
crystal.  In  this  case,  readings  (S24, S27) of  integrated
monitors used in the guidance to targets were virtually
unchanged.

The  proton  beam  extraction  scheme  using bent
crystals,  developed  and  implemented  at  the  U-70
accelerator, offers methods that can be used for further
modifications.  In particular,  in order  to  increase  the
number of  experiments  simultaneously  carried  out  at
the  U-70  accelerator, one more  crystalline  deflector 
station  with  a  crystal  bend  at  an  angle  of (cid:97)9  mrad
(corresponding  to  the  direction of  channel no.22)  was
mounted in straight section no.30.This crystal deflected
a  small  fraction  ((cid:97)107 protons  per  pulse)  of  the  beam,
already  extracted  toward  channel no.23,  to  another
experimental  setup positioned    in  channel no.22 (see
Fig.5).

experimental  setup. X  and Y  are  the  horizontal  and
vertical planes, respectively.

Due  to  such  conditions,  it  became  possible  to 
increase the number of simultaneously operating setups
on  the  flattop  of  the  magnetic  cycle  by up  to  five,
without taking into account the possibility of operating
two  more  internal  targets  in  “shadow”, without  feed
back.

In  the  long  term,  when  operating with  a  50 GeV
proton beam,  it  becomes possible  to  increase  the
duration of the flattop of the magnetic cycle by up to 4
s. For this purpose, the use of the developed extraction
schemes using bent crystals seems to be most adequate
and productive.

Since 1999, the use of bent crystals, to maintain the
high-energy physics program, became systematic in all
the runs of the U-70 accelerator.

7. TESTBED FOR STUDYNG CRYSTALS.
As it was mentioned earlier (see p.6 and fig.4) in the
test region the station Si84 and Si86 are placed to test
crystals and to carry out the experiments with crystals 
in beam collimation mode. This testbed was organised
near the beam loss localisation system of the

U-70 acceleratior.
The loss localization system of the U-70 accelerator
includes a system of local orbit distortion, the absorber
itself,  and  a  set of devices  for diagnosing  and
controlling  the  beam  parameters.  The  layout of  the
testbed is shown in Fig.20.

Figure 20: The layout of crystalline stations and beam
diagnostic  tools  near  the  absorber:  (1)  absorber, (2)
crystalline  stations, (3)  profilometer,  (4)  ionization
chambers, and magnetic units nos. 84-87,

The  system  of  local  orbit  distortion  allows  orbit
deformation in the region where the absorber is placed. 
The beam  displacement  velocity  is  controlled  by  the
front of  the bumps  and  is (cid:97)3  mm/ms.  The  absorber
position  and  the  shape of  local  orbit distortion  are 
shown in Fig.21. Here the bottom numerals correspond
to  the  indices  of  the  accelerator’s magnetic  units,  and 
the  vertical  scale  is  the  distance  from  the  equilibrium
orbit.

Figure 21: Schematic diagram of beam guidance to the
absorber: (1) the shape of the local orbit distortion and
(2) the beam absorber. 

Several  stations with  crystalline  deflectors  were 

installed in the 84th and 86th sections.
During  studies  with  crystal  deflectors  placed  in  the
84th and 86th sections it was also necessary to measure
such parameters  as  the beam  position,  size,  intensity,
and radiation  field  near  the absorber. To  this  end,  a 
complex  system  for  measuring  the  beam  parameters
was  developed.  To  measure  the  radiation  field of
secondary  particles,  eight  loss  monitors,  based  on
ionization chambers filled with air, were mounted near
the  absorber. These  chambers were  positioned  at  a
distance of (cid:97)600 mm from the vacuum chamber of the
accelerator. Moreover, a scintillation detector was used
to  control  the  beam  guidance  onto  the  absorber  and
crystal. Thus a testbed was created for a wide range of
studies  with  crystals  in the  entire  energy  range  of
accelerated protons from 1.5 to 70 GeV.

The  absorber positioned  near  the  circulating beam
results  in  the  fact  that  secondary  particles  escaping

from  it  land  on  the  accelerator  equipment.  Therefore,
the  absorber should  be  characterized by parameters
where  the  dumping  of  protons onto  it  does  not  cause
the  irradiation  of  magnetic units  above  an  acceptable 
value controlled by the number of protons reaching the
absorber  and absorbed  in it.  A  steel  absorber,  2.5  m 
long, installed at the U-70 decreases the total energy of 
the beam of dumped 70GeV protons by ten times.
Such  an  attenuation 
is  attained  at  a  sufficient
displacement  of  the proton beam  from  the  absorber
edge.  Since  particles  are  displaced by  several
micrometers  per  revolution during  the  elimination  of 
the  beam  halo, or  during  the  interception of  lost
protons  using  bumps,  nuclear interactions  of  protons
take  place  on the  absorber  edge.  In  this  circumstance,
particles  deflected  due  to  scattering  into  the  absorber
are  absorbed  quite  efficiently;  however,  particles
deflected  in  the  opposite  direction  are  not  absorbed.
When  operating under these  conditions,  the  energy
absorption efficiency is (cid:97)50% . As the beam deflection
from the  absorber  edge  increases,  the  efficiency  rises
and  reaches (cid:97)90%  in  the  case  of  delivery  at  20mm 
from  the  edge.  The  absorber  thickness  chosen  in  the
radial  direction  is  40  mm.  The  radial  and vertical
absorber  sizes  are  dictated  by  the  vacuum  chamber
aperture.
The crystal operation efficiency was determined using
profilometers. The quality  of  the  collimation  system’s
operation  was  estimated  using  ionization  chambers
placed near  the  collimator,  as    well  as    a system  for 
beam  loss  measurement  over  the  entire accelerator
perimeter. Efficient beam absorption in the   collimator
depends heavily on the depth of the beam dump at the
collimator  entrance  face.  Therefore,  beam location
using  a  crystal  requires optimization  of  parameters
such  as  the  bending  angle  and  the  coordinate  with 
respect  to  the collimator  boundary.  The  efficiency  of 
the crystal itself is undoubtedly a determining factor.

 The efficiency of the crystalline deflectors was
measured by calibrating the profilometers using kicker
magnet of the extraction system.  In this case, the entire
beam was kicked far beyond the absorber edge and the
total  profilometer  signal  corresponded  to  100%  of  the
beam intensity. If the beam is kicked by the crystal, the
ratio  of  the  total  signal  to  that  of  the  signal  obtained
using  the kicker  magnet  yields  the  magnitude  of  the
efficiency  of  the  crystal being studied.  In  the  case
under consideration, the determination of the accuracy
of  this  parameter  depends  on  the  accuracy  of  the
measured  signals.  An  analysis  of  the  measurement
carried out showed that this total error does not exceed
5%.
The  same  tested  was  used  in  experiments  at  a  beam
guidance velocity  of  ~0.7  mm/ms  to  a  crystal  with  a 
bending  angle  of  0.8  mrad  and  a  length of 1.7  mm
along  the  beam.  Figure 22 shows  the results  of  these
measurements,  i.e.,  the beam  density  distributions  in

and 

measurements that the efficiency reaches 85%; that is, 
the same value as during the beam extraction from the 
accelerator (see Sec.6). 

The dependences of changes in the signals measured
using  the  ionization  chamber, when  the  crystal  was 
displaced  in  misaligned  and aligned  states,  are  shown
in  Fig.23. We can  see  that putting  the  crystal  into  the
channeling mode results in a significant decrease in the
number  of  secondary  particles  detected  by 
the
chamber.  This  is  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  number  of 
nuclear interactions of protons with the crystal.

The  major factor  confirming  the  efficiency  of  the 
application of  crystalline  deflectors  to  collimate  the
beam  is  the  experimental  estimates  of  the  total
radiation  field  near  the  absorber.  To  this  end,  we
carried out  measurements  with  ionization  chambers
placed behind the absorber, as is shown in Fig.20. The
radiation  field  depends  on  the  ratio  of  the  fraction of
particles incident into the material depth to those on its 
edge. Figure 24  shows changes in the radiation fields
behind the absorber under various operating conditions

We  can  see  from  Fig.24  that  when  crystals  with  an
efficiency of ~60%  are  used,  the readings  from  the 
ionization  chambers  near  the  86th  unit  show  a
significant decrease in the radiation field in comparison
with  the beam  guidance  to  the  absorber  edge using
bumps. However,  fluxes  of  secondary  particles,
generated by  the  interaction of  protons  with  the
absorber, 
the
absorber but elsewhere as well. Irradiation of the U-70
accelerator  equipment  was  additionally  monitored by
taking  measurements  of  the  secondary particle  flux
using  the  loss  measurement  system. We  showed  that
when operating with an aligned crystal, these fluxes are
weaker  by  a  factor  of  1.6 than  when  the  beam  is
localized using bumps.  These  data  are  in  agreement
with  the  measurement  results  shown  in  Fig.24.  It  is 
clear that radiation fields in the accelerator will further
decrease as the crystal efficiency increases.

Arrangement of crystalline deflector stations near the
absorber  allowed  experiments  a  wide  energy  range.
The  results  of  IHEP  accelerator  experiments  on  the
determination  of  the  crystal  efficiency  at  various
proton  energies,  as  well  as  the  numerical  simulation
results,  are shown  in  Fig.25. A  crystal  1.8*27*0.5
mm3 in size, with a deflection angle of ~0.8 mrad, was
used in these experiments.

Figure  25  a  shows good  agreement  between  the
measured and calculated efficiency of the bent crystal. 
The  efficiency  degradation  as  the  proton  energy
decreases  is  mainly  explained by  increasing  the
rootmean-square  angle  of 
the multiple  Coulomb
scattering and decreasing the dechanneling length. The
dependence  obtained  also shows  that  the  use  of  the
same  crystal  allows beam  extraction  in  an acceptably
wide energy range of 40-70 GeV with an efficiency of
higher than 60%.

(solid  curve)  calculation  and 

We  also note  that  the  dependences  shown  in  Fig.25 
were  measured  using  crystals  with  parameters
optimized  to  attain  the  extraction  efficiency  for  the
70GeV particle beam. Therefore, if we extrapolate the 
calculated curve to energies above 70 GeV, it reaches a
maximum  at  70  GeV  and begins  to decay rapidly  due
to  an  increase  (proportional to  the  particle  energy)  in 
the critical radius of the crystal. 

CONCLUSIONS
The  studies  carried  out  at  the  IHEP  accelerator
showed  that  the use of short  silicon  crystals (cid:97)2  mm 
long  makes  it  possible  to  attain  a  high  efficiency  of 
beam extraction, (cid:97)85%.

The extraction using short bent crystals, developed at
the
IHEP  accelerator,  significantly  extends 
the 
capability  of  experiments
involving  high-energy
beams. This provides,  depending  on experimental
requirements, an  intensity  of  extracted  beams  in  the
range  of 106-1012 particles  per pulse,  thus  allowing
simultaneous operation  of  several  experimental  setups
to  collect  data  and  reducing  the  time  of  experiments.
This extraction is a good addition to the resonant slow 
extraction  existing  at  the  IHEP accelerator,  which 
intensities  of 5*1011-1013
provided  proton beam 
particles  per pulse.  More details  can  be  found  in  our
publications [1-28].

It  would be  expedient  to  make  this  extraction
competitive  with  the  resonant  slow  extraction;  i.e.,  to 
increase  the  intensity  of  extracted  beams  by  ten  times
(from 1012 to 1013 protons per pulse). It seems that this
problem  can  be  solved using more  heat-and  radiation-
resistant crystals instead of silicon ones, e.g., artificial 
diamond, whose parameters are higher by factors 3 and
6, respectively.

We  believe  that  the  high-efficiency  extraction  of 
short  bent  crystals, 
accelerated  particles  using 
developed  at  the  IHEP  accelerator,  will  stimulate
further  development  of  this method  at  other high-
energy accelerators.

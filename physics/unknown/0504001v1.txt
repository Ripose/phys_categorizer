Abstract.  This  paper  proposes  a  modification  to  Minority  Game  (MG)  by 

adding  some  agents  who  play  majority  game  into  MG.  So  it  is  referred  to  as  

Mix-game.  Through  simulations,  this  paper  finds  out  that  the  fluctuations  of 

local  volatilities  change  a  lot  by  adding  some  agents  who  play majority  game 

into MG, but the stylized features of MG don’t change obviously except agents 

with memory length 1 and2. This paper also uses mix-game to model Shanghai 

stock market and to do prediction about Shanghai index.

1.  Introduction 

Minority  game  (MG)  is  an  important  agent-based  financial  market  model 

proposed by D. Challet, and Y. C. Zhang [1]. Neil Johnson [2, 3] and coworkers 

extended MG by allowing a variable number of active traders at each timestep--- 

they called their modified game as the Grand Canonical Minority Game (GCMG). 

2      Chengling Gou 

The GCMG, and to a lesser extent the basic MG itself, can reproduce the stylized 

facts of financial markets, such as volatility clustering and fat-tail distributions.  

 

 

 

However, there are some weaknesses in MG and GCMG. First, the diversity of 

agents  is  limited,  since  agents  all  have  the  same  memory  and  time-horizon. 

Second, in real markets, some agents are tendency-followers, i.e. “noise traders” 

[4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9],  who  effectively  play  a  majority  game;  while  others  are 

“foundation traders”, who effectively play a minority game. 

In  order  to  create  an  agent-based  model  which  more  closely  mimics  a  real 

financial market, this paper modifies the MG model by dividing agents into two 

groups: each group has different memory and time-horizon. The most important 

modification is to make one group play the minority game and the other play the 

majority game. For this reason, I will refer to this system as a ‘mix-game’ model. 

This  paper  first  presents  the  simulation  results  of  mix-game,  and  then  gives 

examples of application of mix-game model. 

2.  Simulation Results and Discussions: 

In mix-game, there are two groups of agents; group1 plays the majority game, 

and the group2 plays the minority game. N is the total number of the agents and 

N1 is number of agents of group1. The system resource is R=N*L, where L<1 is 

the  proportion  of  the  system  resource. All  agents  compete  in  the  system  for  the 

limited resource R. T1 and T2 are the time horizon lengths of the two groups of 

Dynamic Behaviors of Mix-game Model and Its Applications      3 

agents, and m1 and m2 denote the memory lengths of the two groups of agents, 

respectively. 

 

 

Only  the  global  information  available  to  the  agents  is  a  common  bit-string 

“memory” of the m1 or m2 most recent competition outcomes. A strategy consists 

of a response, i.e., 0 or 1, to each possible bit string; hence there are 

m

122

or 

22

m

21

 

possible strategies for group 1 or group 2, respectively, which form full strategy 

spaces  (FSS).  At  the  beginning  of  the  game,  each  agent  is  assigned  s  strategies 

and keeps them unchangeable during the game. After each turn, agents assign one 

(virtual) point to a strategy which would have predicted the correct outcome. For 

agents  in  group  1,  they  will  reward  their  strategies  one  point  if  they  are  in  the 

majority; for agents in group 2, they will reward their strategies one point if they 

are in the minority. Agents collect the virtual points for their strategies over the 

time horizon T1 or T2, and agents use their strategy which has the highest virtual 

point in each turn. If there are two strategies which have the highest virtual point, 

agents use coin toss to decide which strategy to be used.   Excess demand is equal 

to the number of ones (buy) which agents choose minus the number of zeros (sell) 

which  agents  choose.  According  to  a  widely  accepted  assumption  that  excess 

demand  exerts  a  force  on  the  price  of  the  asset  and  the  change  of  price  is 

proportion to the excess demand in a financial market [11, 12], the time series of 

price of the asset can be calculated based on the time series of excess demand. 

All  simulations  are  performed  with  a  randomly  uniform  QDM,  which  means 

agents’ strategies are randomly distributed in the strategy space and they remain 

4      Chengling Gou 

unchanged  during  the  simulation.  Each  agent  has  two  strategies  (s=2).The 

simulation runs are 3000. The window length of local volatility is 5 and L is 0.5. 

2.1 The Effect of Mix-game on Local Volatilities

to Guide Eyes. 

 

To  see  the  effect  of  mix-game  on  local  volatilities,  simulations  are  done  with 

parameters m1= m2=6, T1=T2=60, N=101, 201, 301, 401 and N1/N~=0%, 10%, 

20%,  30%,  40%,  50%.  The  means  of  local  volatilities  decrease  while  N1/N 

increase  from  0  to  40%,  as  shown  in  the  left  half  of  Fig.1.  Some  of  local 

volatilities  eventually  drop  to  zero  when  N1/N>=50%.  The  similar  results  are 

obtained  with  m1=  m2=3,  T1=T2=12,  N=101,  201,  301,  401  and  N1/N~=0%, 

10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, as shown in the right half of Fig.1. This means the 

efficiency  of  a  system  can  be  improved  by  adding  some  agents  with  the  same 

parameters  (i.e.  m1=m2,  T1=T2.)  who  play  the  majority  game.  Kephart,  J.  O., 

Hogg,  T.  &  Huberman,  B.  A.  observed  the  similar  phenomena  in  distributed 

Dynamic Behaviors of Mix-game Model and Its Applications      5 

computing systems [10].

are Used to Guide Eyes. 

Fig. 2 shows the simulation results with parameters m1<m2, T1<T2 which are 

different  from  that  in  Fig1.  In  this  situation,  means  of  local  volatilities  do  not 

decrease  monotonously,  but  have  the  lowest  points,  which  is  located  about 

N1/N=20%. The left half figure shows the simulation results with parameters of 

m1=3,  m2=6,  T1=12,  T2=60,  and  the  right  half  figure  shows  the  simulation 

results  with  parameter  m1=3,  m2=6,  T1=50,  T2=60.  Comparing  the  two  half 

figures,  we  also  can  notice  that  the  means  of  local  volatilities  are  smaller  with 

larger  T1  and  T2.  Some  of  local  volatilities  eventually  drop  to  zero  when 

N1/N>=50%. 

 

 

Fig. 3 shows the simulation results with m1>m2 and T1>T2, where means of 

local  volatilities  some  times  decrease,  but  some  times  increase  while  N1/N 

increases from 0 to 0.4.

 Fig.4 Medians of Local Volatilities vs. Different Memory Length of Group1 
or Group 2 (m1 or m2). 

 
 

In  order  to  see  if  local  volatilities  increase  when  agents  with  larger  memory 

length  (m1>m2)  play  the  majority  game,  I  do  simulations  with  parameters  of 

T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72,  m1=1~6  and  m2=1~6.  The  simulation  results  are 

shown  in  Fig.4,  where  Vol.1  representing  median  of  local  volatilities  of  m2=6, 

T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72,  s=2  and  m1  varying  from  1  to  6,  and  Vol.2 

representing median of local volatilities of m1=6, T1=T2=12, N=201, N1=72, s=2 

and m2 varying from 1 to 6. From Fig.4, one can find that the medians of local 

Dynamic Behaviors of Mix-game Model and Its Applications      7 

volatilities  (Vol.1  and  Vol.2)  increase  while  the  memory  length  m1  or  m2 

decreases from 6 to 1 in both simulation situations. But the difference is that Vol.2 

is much larger than Vol.1 when m1 or m2 is smaller than 5. This shows that local 

volatilities do increase obviously when m1=6>m2, except m2=5 and the smaller 

m2, the greater changes of local volatilities. 

2.2 The Effect of Mix-game on Time Series

Fig.  5a  and  Fig.  5c  show  the  time  series  of  MG  with  different  parameters  as 

8      Chengling Gou 

indicated  in  figures.  Fig.  5b  and  Fig.5d  show  the  time  series  of  mix-game  with 

parameters  of  m1=m2,  T1=T2  and  N1/N=10%.  From  Fig.  5,  one  can  see  that 

some agents’ playing the majority game do not change the features of time series 

and local volatilities under the condition of m1=m2, T1=T2, but only reduce the 

fluctuation of systems as mentioned before.

From  Fig.  6,  one  can  observe  that  under  condition  of  m2=6  and  m1<m2,  the 

features  of  time  series  change  dramatically  if  some  agents  with  m1=1  or  m1=2 

play  the  majority  game.  But  the  features  of  time  series  nearly  don’t  change  if 

some agents with 6>m1>=3 play the majority game. 

From  Fig.  7,  one  can  note  that  under  condition  of  m1=6>m2,  the  features  of 

time series nearly don’t change if some agents with m1 play the majority game.

3.  Application of Mix-game Model 

From  the  former  two  sections,  one  can  find  out  that  mix-game  with  some 

parameters reproduces the stylized features of financial time series, but some fail 

to do so. Therefore, one need to choose parameters of m1, m2, T1, T2, N and N1 

by using mix-game to model financial markets. The following aspects need to be 

considered: 

•  First  make  sure  the  time  series  of  mix-game  can  reproduce  the  stylized 

facts  of  time  series  of  financial  markets  by  choosing  proper  parameters, 

and m1 and m2 must be larger than 2; 

•  Second pay attention to the fluctuation of local volatilities, and ensure that 

the median of local volatilities of mix-game is similar to that of the target 

Dynamic Behaviors of Mix-game Model and Its Applications      11 

time series; 

 

•  Third make sure the log-log plot of absolute returns look similar. 

Since the median value of local volatilities of Shanghai Index daily data from 

1992/01/02  to  2004/03/19  is  222,  two  combinations  of  parameters  of  mix-game 

have  the  similar  median  values  of  local  volatilities  according  to  Fig.4;  one 

combination  is  m1=3,  m2=6,  T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72,  the  other  is  m1=4, 

m2=6, T1=T2=12, N=201, N1=72.

Fig.8, Fig. 9 and Fig.10 show that mix-game with m1=3, T1=12, m2=6, T2=60, 

N1=72, N=201 can reproduce the similar stylized facts of Shanghai stock market. 

So  does  the  combination  of  parameters  of  m1=4,  m2=6,  T1=T2=12,  N=201, 

 

N1=72.

Using mix-game to predict Shanghai stock market, it is found that the hit rates 

are sensitive to parameters of the model and the initial states of agents’ strategies. 

First,  I  optimize  the  parameters  of  mix-game  by  using  random  initial  states  of 

agents’ strategies. I find that mix-game behaves well with seven configurations of 

parameters  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  their  specified  initial  states  of  agents’ 

strategies for Shanghai Index and the best hit rate is 61% so far.

In  mix-game,  some  local  volatilities  drop  to  zeros  if  N1/N>=50%.  If 

N1/N<50%,  means  of  local  volatilities  decrease  monotonously  with  increase  of 

N1/N if m1=m2; means of local volatilities decrease first and then increase with 

increase of N1/N if m1<m2; if m1>m2, means of local volatilities increase, and 

14      Chengling Gou 

the  smaller  m2  is,  the  larger  the  increase  of  means  of  local  volatilities  is.  If 

N1/N<50%,  agents’  playing  majority  game  nearly  do  not  change  the  stylized 

features of MG except m1=1 or 2 <m2=6. 

 

Mix-game can be a potentially good model for financial markets with specific 

parameters.  For  Shanghai  Index,  there  are  two  suitable  configurations  of 

parameters:  m1=3,  T1=12,  m2=6,  T2=12,  N1=72,  N=201  and  m1=4,  m2=6, 

T1=T2=12,  N=201,  N1=72  respectively.  For  any  other  financial  market, 

parameters need to be adjusted. And using mix-game to do prediction of financial 

market, high hit rate could be reached.

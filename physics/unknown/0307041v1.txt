ABSTRACT

Introducing  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  in
addition  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  we  assume  that  gravity-free  space  and  time  possess  the
Euclidean structures in the primed inertial coordinate system and the generalized Finslerian structures in
the usual inertial coordinate system. We combine these assumptions with two fundamental postulates, (i)
the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames of reference, to
derive  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  as  a  linear  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial
coordinate systems. Based on this, it is proposed that all laws of physics are locally Lorentz-invariant  in
the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  As  a  Lorentz-invariant  law  of  physics  must  be  locally  Lorentz-
invariant while a locally Lorentz-invariant law is not necessarily Lorentz-invariant, the change  from  the
requirement of Lorentz invariance to that of the local Lorentz invariance on laws of physics provides with
a larger acceptable scope to explore these laws. The localization of Lorentz transformation and its induced
local Lorentz invariance precisely meet the demands of Einstein’s theory of gravitation.

velocity of IFR2 to IFR1, u=(usus)1/2 and

g =1/(1-u2/c2)1/2 .

The  transformation  now  bears  his  name.  Here,  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  in  inertial  frame  of
reference is in Einstein’s definition which will be quoted below. Lorentz’s this discovery made theoretical
physics  situated:  Galilean-invariant  mechanics  and  Lorentz-invariant  (invariant  under  the  Lorentz
transformation)  electrodynamics  co-existed.  A  question  was  naturally  raised:  Of 
the  Galilean
transformation  and  the  Lorentz  transformation,  which  one  is  the  actual  transformation  between  the  two
usual inertial coordinate systems?

Believing in the principle of relativity and Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetic fields, in his
special theory of relativity, Einstein derived the Lorentz transformation as a linear transformation between
any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  proposed  that  all  laws  of  physics  in  nature  are  Lorentz-
invariant in the usual inertial coordinate system [2,3]. He also developed Lorentz-invariant mechanics for
a  particle  [2,3].  Since,  the  Lorentz  invariance  has  become  a  physical  principle:  In  the  usual  inertial
coordinate system, all physical laws keep their forms under the Lorentz transformation. This principle has
been very successful in exploring laws of physics in various, though not all, fields.

In this paper, we derive the localized Lorentz transformation as a linear transformation between
any two usual inertial coordinate systems and propose that all laws of physics are locally Lorentz-invariant
(invariant under the localized Lorentz transformation) in the usual inertial coordinate system. The paper
consists  of  seven  sections:  introduction,  justification  for  localizing  Lorentz  transformation,  derivation  of
Lorentz transformation, local structures of gravity-free space and time, localized Lorentz transformation,
relativistic velocity space, conclusion and discussion.

2. JUSTIFICATION FOR LOCALIZING LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION

everywhere and every time.

(3b)

Logically,  the  Lorentz  transformation  covers  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  and  the
localized  Lorentz  transformation  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  Lorentz  transformation.  So,  a  Lorentz-
invariant  law  must  be  locally  Lorentz-invariant  while  a  locally  Lorentz-invariant  law  is  not  necessarily
Lorentz-invariant.  It  is  weaker  to  demand  a  law  to  be  locally  Lorentz-invariant.  The  change  from  the
requirement of Lorentz invariance to that of the local Lorentz invariance on laws of physics provides with
a larger acceptable scope to explore these laws.

There  is  a  great  need  for  this  change.  The  continuous  efforts  to  construct  Lorentz-invariant
statistical mechanics and thermodynamics for many-particle systems began soon after Einstein’s work on
special relativity. But all these efforts have failed. So  far  we  have  not  had  a  Lorentz-invariant  statistical
mechanics  and  thermodynamics  for  many-particle  systems.  In  the  framework  of  special  relativity,  the
concepts of sized particles and rigid bodies (systems of particles) are not allowed. All particles are point-
like or string-like. We  are  not  entitled  to  have  a  Lorentz-invariant  mechanics  for  rigid  bodies.  We  have
Lorentz-invariant theories of fields and quantized fields but they, as well as string and superstring theories
[4], have suffered from the divergence problem. Phenomenological substituting several finite experimental
values  of  particle  masses  and  charge  for  their  infinities  in  theoretical  calculations,  physicists  developed
renormalization techniques to remove all divergence in some quantized fields. However, not all quantized
fields  are  renormalizable,  and  it  is  hard  to  accept  such  a  kind  of  renormalizability  as  a  basic  physical
principle.  Moreover,  as  Feynman  said:  “renormalization  of  a  quantity  gives  up  any  possibility  of
calculating  that  quantity”  [5],  the  renormalized  theory  of  quantized  fields  fails  to  explain  a  class  of
important phenomena, mass differences in the groups of neutron-proton, the p -mesons, the K-mesons, the
S -baryons and the X
-baryons. It is not futile to expect a locally Lorentz-invariant statistical mechanics and
thermodynamics for many-particle systems, a locally Lorentz-invariant mechanics  for  rigid  bodies  and  a
locally Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory with no divergence problem.

There is a hint for this change. According to Einstein’s theory of gravitation, the trajectory of an
object  under  gravitational  interaction  is  independent  of  the  mass  of  the  object,  so  the  presence  of
gravitational  forces  must  be  locally  equivalent  to  the  use  of  non-inertial  frame  of  reference.  This  is  the
equivalence  principle.  The  word  “locally”  means  a  sufficiently  small  region  in  space  and  time.  The
locality  of  the  equivalence  principle  lets  the  local  Lorentz  invariance,  not  Lorentz  invariance,  stand  in
Einstein’s theory of gravitation: In the presence of gravitational field, all non-gravitational laws of physics
are locally Lorentz-invariant in the freely falling coordinate system [6].

Experimental  facts  are  in  favor  of  this  change.  Experiments  directly  supporting  the  Lorentz
invariance can be divided into several groups relevant to: the constancy of the speed of light, the Einstein
time dilation, the Einstein velocity addition law, relativistic mass-velocity and mass-energy relations, and
relativistic Doppler effects. About the constancy of the speed of light, two research groups, of Turner and
Hill [7], and of Champeney et al [8], placed a Co57 source near the rim of a standard centrifuge with an
iron absorber near the axis of rotation. They used the Mossbauer effect to look for any velocity dependence
of  the  frequency  of  the  14.4  KeV  g -rays  as  seen  by  the  Fe57  in  the  absorber.  They  established  limits  of
D c/c<2x10-10  for  the  anisotropy  in  the  one-way  speed  of  light.  Riis  and  his  colleagues  [9]  compared  the
frequency  of  a  two-photon  transition  in  a  fast  atomic  beam  to  that  of  a  stationary  absorber  while  the
direction  of  the  fast  beam  is  rotated  relative  to  the  fixed  stars  and  found  the  upper  limit  D c/c<3.5x10-9
firstly  and  D c/c<2x10-11  later  for  the  anisotropy.  The  experiment  of  Krisher  et  al  [10]  was  made  using
highly stable hydrogen-maser frequency  standards  (clocks)  separated  by  over  21  km  and  connected  by  a
ultrastable fiber optics link. The limits yielded from the experimental data are respectively D c/c<2x10-7 for
linear dependency and D c/c<2x10-8 for quadratic dependency on the velocity of the Earth with respect to
the  cosmic  microwave  background. The  Einstein  time  dilation  was  verified  by  Bailey  et  al  [11]  to  an
accuracy of 1x10-3 and by Kaivola et al [12] to an accuracy of 4x10-5. More accurate result, 2.3X10-6, can
be found in the report made by R. W. McGowan et al [13]. The Einstein velocity addition law reads

Ref.[16] contains a complete discussion on their experimental facts and a long list of these experimental
facts. Relativistic Doppler effect is expressed in equation

  as  observed  in  a  moving
inertial frame of  reference  with  relative  velocity  yr,  y=(yryr)1/2,  where  f   is  an  angle  between  wave  vector
and velocity yr, g  is in Eq.(2). It is the transverse Doppler shift when f =p /2, which never exists in the pre-
relativistic  equation  of  Doppler  effect.  The  relativistic  Doppler  effect  is  in  accord  with  experiments
[12,13]. As the local Lorentz invariance involves the constancy of the speed of light, the Einstein velocity
addition law and the Einstein time dilation as well as Lorentz invariance, as the local Lorentz invariance
leads  to  the  same  equations  of  motion  for  a  particle  and  for  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave  as  Lorentz
invariance [17], as the localized Lorentz transformation can be extended to Lorentz transformation in the
case  of  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave  (see  below,  in  Section  5),  all  experiments  directly  supporting
Lorentz invariance also support the local Lorentz invariance. We do not have any experimental fact which
is within the Lorentz invariance but beyond the local Lorentz invariance.

3. DERIVATION OF LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION

Two fundamental postulates stated by Einstein in his derivation of Lorentz transformation are (i)
the  principle  of  relativity  and  (ii)  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light  in  all  inertial  frames  of  reference.
Conceptually,  the  principle  of  relativity  means  that  there  exists  a  class  of  equivalent  inertial  frames  of
reference, any one of which moves with a non-zero constant velocity relative to any other and any one of
which is supplied with motionless, rigid unit rods of equal length and motionless, synchronized clocks of
equal running rate. Einstein wrote: “in a given inertial frame of reference the coordinates mean the results
of  certain  measurements  with  rigid  (motionless)  rods,  a  clock  at  rest  relative  to  the  inertial  frame  of
reference defines a local time, and the local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized clocks
and taken together, give the time of this inertial frame of reference.” [18] As defined by Einstein, in each
inertial frame of reference, an observer can employ his motionless-rigid rods and motionless-synchronized
clocks in the so-called “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method to
measure space and time intervals. By using this “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock”
measurement method, the observer in each inertial frame of reference sets up his usual inertial coordinate
system,  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3.  Postulate  (ii)  asserts  that  the  measured  speed  of  light  is  the  same  constant  c  in
every such usual inertial coordinate system.

However, for  derivation  of  the  Lorentz  transformation,  another  assumption  is  necessary  besides
the two postulates. This other assumption concerns the Euclidean structure  of  gravity-free  space  and  the
homogeneity of gravity-free time in the usual inertial coordinate system,

rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,

everywhere  and  every  time.  Postulates  (i)  and  (ii)  and  the  assumption  Eqs.(5a-5b)  together  yield  the
Lorentz transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate systems. Indeed though this assumption
was not explicitly articulated, evidently having been considered self-evident, Einstein said in 1907: “Since
the  propagation  velocity  of  light  in  empty  space  is  c  with  respect  to  both  reference  systems,  the  two
2=0  must  be  equivalent.”  [3].  Leaving  aside  the
equations,  x1
question  whether  postulate  (i)  implies  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial
coordinate  systems  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  velocities  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems, we know that these two equivalent equations, the linearity of transformation and the reciprocity
of relative velocities exactly lead to Lorentz transformation.

Some  physicists  explicitly  articulated  the  assumption  Eqs.(5a-5b)  in  their  works  on  the  topic.
Pauli wrote: “This also implies the validity of Euclidean geometry and the homogeneous nature of space
and time.” [19]. Fock said: “The logical foundation of these methods is, in principle, the hypothesis that
Euclidean geometry is applicable to real physical space together with further assumptions, viz. that rigid
bodies exist and that light travels in straight lines.” [20].

Minkowski [21] showed that Lorentz transformation is just a rotation in this four-dimensional spacetime.
The Minkowskian structure is a four-dimensional version of the assumption Eqs.(5a-5b).

4. LOCAL STRUCTURES OF GRAVITY-FREE SPACE AND TIME

To derive the localized Lorentz transformation, we keep two postulates (i) and (ii) but renew the

(x1,x2,x3,t) and (x1+dx1,x2+dx2,x3+dx3,t+dt).

The  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method  is  not  all
that  each  inertial  frame  of  reference  has.  For  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  we  imagine  other
measurement  methods  that  are  different  from  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized
clock”  measurement  method.  By  taking  these  other  measurement  methods,  an  observer  in  each  inertial
frame  of  reference  can  set  up  other  inertial  coordinate  systems,  just  as  well  as  he  can  set  up  his  usual
inertial  coordinate  system  by  taking  the    “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”
measurement  method.  We  call  these  other  inertial  coordinate  systems  the  unusual  inertial  coordinate
systems. One of the unusual inertial coordinate systems is the primed inertial coordinate system, denoted
by {x’r, t’}, r=1,2,3.

We  do  believe  in  flatness  of  gravity-free  space  and  time.  We  further  assume  that  gravity-free

space and time have the Euclidean structures in the primed inertial coordinate system,

rsdx’rdx’s,   r,s=1,2,3, 

dX2=d
dT2=dt'2 ,
everywhere and every time.

      

 

The  non-Euclidean  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate
system  specified  by  two  metric  tensors  grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)  and  g(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)  are  of  the  so-called
generalized  Finsler  geometry  [22-26].  The  generalized  Finsler  geometry  is  a  generalization  of  Riemann
geometry. It can be endowed  with  the  Cartan  connection  [26].  When  and  only  when  y  approaches  zero,
metric tensors grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt) and g(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt) become the Euclidean.

5. THE LOCALIZED LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION

Two assumptions  Eqs.(6a-6g)  and  Eqs.(7a-7b)  and  two  postulates  (i)  and  (ii)  together  yield  the

localized Lorentz transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate systems.

Introducing y’s=dx’s/dt’, s=1,2,3, we have from Eqs.(6a-6g) and Eqs.(7a-7b),

between a Newtonian velocity yr and its corresponding primed velocity y’r. In Eq.(8b), as y goes to c, we

Primed speed c’ is actually a new version  of  the  speed  of  light,  the  speed  of  light  in  the  primed  inertial
coordinate  system.  On  the  invariant  Newtonian  speed  c  in  all  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  primed
speed c’ is invariant in all primed inertial coordinate systems.

Two  equivalent  equations  Eqs.(10a-10b),  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  two  {x’r

m,tm},  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  velocities
m,tm} lead to the localized Lorentz transformation, Eqs.(3a-3b), between two usual inertial

m,tm}, m=1,2.

In  general,  gravity-free  space  and  time  have  different  non-uniform  structures  in  two  different
usual inertial coordinate systems {xr
m,tm}, m=1,2. The localized Lorentz transformation between these two
usual inertial coordinate systems can not be extended to Lorentz transformation, in other words, we have
no longer the Lorentz transformation between them. In the case that gravity-free space and  time  possess
identical  uniform  structures  in  these  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  the  localized  Lorentz
transformation  between  them  can  be  extended  to  the  Lorentz  transformation.  A  plane  electromagnetic
wave in empty space (y=c) is of the case.

Let  us  look  at  some  direct  consequences  of  the  assumptions  Eqs.(6a-6g)  and  Eqs.(7a-7b).

velocity-coordinates  {yr}  and  the  primed  velocity-coordinates  {y’r},  r=1,2,3.  We  call  this  velocity  space
the relativistic velocity space. The relativistic velocity  space  is  characterized  by  a  finite  boundary  at  y=c
and  the  Einstein  velocity  addition  law  in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates  and  by  unboundedness  and  the
Galilean velocity addition law in the primed velocity-coordinates [17]. Eqs.(13a-13b) and Eq.(14b) imply

The  geometric  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  usual  and  the  primed  inertial
coordinate  systems  respectively  match  that  of  the  relativistic  velocity  space  in  the  usual  and  the  primed
velocity-coordinates. Generating two representations of the relativistic velocity space in the usual and the
primed velocity-coordinates, such matching enables us to get the relativistic generalization of Maxwell’s
velocity distribution [27-29].

falls off to zero as y goes to c.

The  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution  has  been  used  to  explain  the  observed  non-
Maxwellian  decay  mode  of  high-energy  tails  in  velocity  distributions  of  astrophysical  plasma  (planetary
magnetospheres,  solar  wind  and  other)  particles  [30].  The  deviation  of  the  decay  mode  of  these  high-
energy tails from Maxwellian has been observed for many years [31-34]. Experimental data were mostly,
if  not  all,  modeled  by  the  k  (kappa)  distribution.  As  experimental  data  seem  to  be  well  modeled  by  the
kappa distribution, as  the  kappa  distribution  contains  a  power-law  decay  when  y  goes  to  infinity,  it  was
concluded  that  the  decay  mode  of  high-energy  tails  in  velocity  distributions  of  astrophysical  plasma
particles is power-law like. This conclusion is rather misleading. The kappa distribution shapes

where q =[(2k -3)/k ]1/2(KBT/m)1/2, G
 is the gamma function and kappa is a parameter to be determined in
comparison  with  experimental  data  [33,34].  Different  values  of  kappa  correspond  to  different  kinds  of
velocity  distribution.  When  and  only  when  kappa  goes  to  infinity,  the  kappa  distribution  becomes  the
Maxwellian. The kappa distribution can not be a  good  modeling  distribution  for  experimental  data.  The
reasons  are:  For  any  value  of  kappa,  the  kappa  distribution  extends  as  far  as  y= ¥
,  while  experimental
data,  we  believe,  as  far  as  y=c;  Velocity  distribution  of  low-energy  particles,  as  observed,  can  be  well
described by the Maxwellian distribution, but the kappa distribution with any finite kappa value does not
reduce  to  the  Maxwellian  even  for  small  y;  The  values  of  kappa  in  fitting  experimental  data  vary  from

event to event [32]. The relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution predicts a new decay mode for those
high-energy tails: falling off to zero, as y goes to c, slower than any exponential decay, exp{-[2c/(c-y)]B},
and faster than any power-law decay, (c-y)n, where B and n are two positive numbers [30].

The relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution has been also used to calculate the nuclear fusion
reaction rate [35,36]. To create a nuclear fusion reaction, a proton or nucleus must penetrate the repulsive
Coulomb  barrier  and  be  close  to  another  proton  or  nucleus  so  that  the  strong  interaction  between  them
acts. The Coulomb barrier is in general much higher than thermal energy, so nuclear fusion reactions can
occur  only  among  few  high-energy  protons  and  nuclei.  If,  under  the  conditions  for  nuclear  fusion
reactions, interacting protons and nuclei reach their equilibrium distribution in the period of time that is
infinitesimal  compared  to  the  mean  lifetime  of  nuclear  fusion  reactions,  it  is  the  equilibrium  velocity
distribution  of  these  few  high-energy  protons  and  nuclei  that  participates  in  determining  the  rate  of
nuclear  fusion  reactions.  In  this  circumstance,  it  is  inappropriate  to  use  the  Maxwellian  velocity
distribution to calculate the nuclear fusion reaction rate [36]. We have to use the  relativistic  equilibrium
velocity distribution for the purpose. The calculation results indicate that the nuclear fusion reaction rate
based on the relativistic equilibrium distribution,  R,  has  a  reduction  factor  with  respect  to  that  based  on
the Maxwellian velocity distribution, RM,

where the reduction factor, tanhQ/Q, depends on temperature T, reduced mass m
 and atomic numbers z1
and z2 of the studied nuclear fusion reactions. In other words, the reduction factor varies with the kind of
neutrinos. Since 0<Q< ¥
, the reduction factor takes values between 0 and 1, 0<tanhQ/Q<1, that gives rise
to

0<R<RM. 

Eqs.(19a-19b) and (20) signify much in resolving the solar neutrino problem. The relativistic equilibrium
velocity distribution is a possible solution to the solar neutrino problem [36-39].

To  match  the  gravity-free  space  and  time  and  the  relativistic  velocity  space  in  their  geometric
structures is  important.  As  being  generalized  to  the  case  where  gravitational  field  presents,  it  leads  to  a
prediction  on  the  velocity  distribution  of  low-energy  particles  in  the  presence  of  spherically  symmetric
gravitational field, as a test of Einstein’s theory of gravitation [40].

7. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

(1)  Introducing  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  in
addition to the usual inertial coordinate system, we have assumed that gravity-free space and time possess
the Euclidean structures in the primed inertial coordinate system and the generalized Finslerian structures
in the usual inertial coordinate system.

(2) We have combined these two assumptions with two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle
of  relativity  and  (ii)  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light  in  all  inertial  frames  of  reference,  to  derive  the
localized  Lorentz  transformation  as  a  linear  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems. The theory founded by the two assumptions and the two postulates is called the modified special
relativity theory [17,27,41].

(3) It is based on the principle of relativity and the localized Lorentz transformation between any
two usual inertial coordinate systems to conclude that all laws of physics are locally Lorentz-invariant in
the usual inertial coordinate system.

(4) As the Lorentz transformation covers the localized Lorentz transformation and the localized
Lorentz  transformation  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  Lorentz  transformation,  a  Lorentz-invariant  law  of
physics must be locally Lorentz-invariant while a locally Lorentz-invariant law is not necessarily Lorentz-
invariant. The change from the requirement of Lorentz invariance to that of the local Lorentz invariance
on laws of physics provides with a larger acceptable scope to explore these laws.

(5) It is the “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method that
we  use  in  our  experiments.  All  our  experimental  data  are  collected  and  expressed  in  the  usual  inertial

coordinate system. To get locally Lorentz-invariant laws of physics in the usual inertial coordinate system,
we can take the physical principle of local Lorentz invariance: All physical laws  keep  their  forms  under
the  localized  Lorentz  transformation.  This  physical  principle  must  be  incorporated  into  the  generalized
Finslerian structures of gravity-free space and time in the usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  However,  we
have  an  alternative  physical  principle  for  getting  locally  Lorentz-invariant  laws  of  physics  in  the  usual
inertial coordinate system [17].

(6) According to our recent work  [17],  the  locally  Lorentz-invariant  mechanics  for  a  particle  is
the same as Lorentz-invariant one and the  locally  Lorentz-invariant  quantum  field  theory  is  divergence-
free.

meet the demands of Einstein’s theory of gravitation.

(8)  Our  assumptions  on  the  local  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  are  experimentally

In  this  paper,  we  did  not  define  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  from  the  measurement
point of view. We did not discuss the measurement contents involved  in  the  primed  velocity,  either.  We
prefer doing these somewhere else [42].

Euclidean  geometry  does  not  characterize  dynamic  electronic  orbitals 
satisfactorily  for  even  a  single  electron  in  a  hydrogen  atom  is  a  formidable 
mathematical task with Schrödinger’s equation. Here the author puts forward a 
new  spacetime  concept  that  regards  space  and  time  as  two  orthogonal, 
symmetric and complementary quantities. They are inherent physical quantities 
that cannot be divorced from physical objects themselves. In two-dimensional 
helium shell, space and time are instantiated by two interactive 1s electrons; in 
four-dimensional neon shell, space and time dimensions blend into four types 
of  curvilinear  vectors  represented  by  2s,  2px,  2py,  and  2pz  electronic  orbitals. 
The  description  of  electronic  orbitals  constitutes  an  explanation  of  canonical 
spacetime properties such as harmonic oscillation, electromagnetism, and wave 
propagation. Through differential and integral operations, the author formulates 
a  precise  wavefunction  for  every  electron  in  an  inert  neon  atom  where 
spacetime,  as  dimensional  graduated  by  ten  electrons,  is  continuous,  and 
trigonometric  function  is  the  mechanism  for  dimension  curling  up.  This  fresh 
spacetime view based on dimensional interpretation of complex functions is an 
extension of classical mechanics and is compatible with relativity and quantum 
physics. It brings sharp insight into the geometries of 2p-orbitals and has broad 
support from chemistry.   

 

 

 

1.  Introduction 

 
Since antiquity, humans have believed that they know about space and time because of 
their direct experience, but scientific conception of them turns out to be elusive. This is not 
because space and  time  are  so  complex  but  they  are  so  fundamental  that  there  is  not  any 
preceding rule for reference. Einstein set forth relativity based on Minkowski coordinates 
that couple three-dimensional space with one-dimensional time through events, but gained 
results  such  as  time  dilation  and  space  contraction  that  cannot  be  easily  explained  by 
traditional  Euclidean  space  and  Newtonian  time.  In  1919,  Kaluza  unified  Maxwell's 
electromagnetism and Einstein's general relativity and gravity by adding a fifth dimension 
[1]. He suggested that the fifth space dimension normally curls up and is hidden from direct 
visualization.  To  date,  the  detailed  mechanism  for  dimension  curling  up,  however,  has 
never  been  demonstrated  either  mathematically  or  physically.  Turning  our  focus  to 
microcosm,  quantum  mechanics  uses  statistical  probability  and  quantum  numbers  to 
describes  electrons.  This  uncertainty  approach  is  radically  different  from  that  of  classical 
mechanics. Moreover, relativity and quantum physics remain detached and must be unified. 
Since space and time are the most relevant and underlying physical quantities for relativity, 
classical and quantum mechanics, the lack of unification among the three fields prompts us 
to search for new space and time concepts on a more profound level than the homogeneous 
Euclidean  space  and  uniform  Newtonian  time.  This  paper  explores  the  basic  concept  of 
spacetime starting from two-dimensional helium shell and further proposes the mechanism 
for dimensions curling up in four-dimensional neon shell.

2. Two-dimensional spacetime 

 
In spite of the great progress made in relativity and quantum mechanics during the last 
century, our current conception of spacetime is still framed by three-dimensional Euclidean 
geometry  and  one-dimensional  Newtonian  time.  To  establish  a  more  fundamental 
spacetime concept other than that framework, we need to be cautious on any presumptions 
that we have inadvertently introduced. Space and time are the foundation and background 
of all sciences. Let’s discard every antecedent belief and premise except saying that space 
and  time  are  a  pair  of  the  most  fundamental  physical  quantities.  They  are  inherent 
properties that cannot be divorced from physical entity as if two sides of a coin cannot be 
divorced from the coin itself.   

To  expatiate  on  what  space  and  time  are  from  scratch,  we  notice  that  there  are  two 
electrons in an inert helium atom. We may associate space with one electron, and time with 
the other, or in a more general dynamic manner as will be introduced. Helium shell is such 
a conservative system that both electrons should best represent the two basic dimensions. It 
is by this approach that we explore the property of space and time through the description 
of electronic orbitals.

How to express various spacetime dimensions in two-dimensional helium shell? If we 
start with a dimensionless quantity, change it in the direction of reducing a time dimension 
and increasing a space dimension, and reverse the other way around to complete a cycle, 
then we get four types of dimensional quantities out of the possible one-dimensional space 
and one-dimensional time combinations as represented by (1,  ω,  v ,  r ) with SI units of 
(1, 1/s, m/s, m) respectively, using meter and second to denote space and time units. Thus, 
the significance of complex notations in eq. (9) may be interpreted as:

In  the  simplest  sense,  oscillation  of  electrons  is  similar  to  a  pendulum.  However,  if 
electrons were orbiting around the nucleus like planets around the sun kinematically, then 
they  would  emit  energy  due  to  their  high  frequency.  As  a  result,  the  system  would  be 
damped quickly. To overcome this, electrons must oscillate through changing states so that 
both electrons exchange energy, i.e., each electron receives the quantity emitted by another 
so that helium shell remains conservative. Here the electron is revolving in the sense that it 
changes physical state continuously and periodically as the state point, A, orbits around the 
origin O (Fig. 1). The circular track of  point  A  represents  the  pathway  of  electronic  state 
transformation rather a kinematic movement.   
Combining eqs. (12) and (13) yields 

which means that the changing rate of one electron in time is compensated by the varying 
rate of another in space. This equation is similar to Faraday’s law:

  as a magnetic field and

  as an electric field, then eq. (16) is another expression of 
Faraday’s  law.  This  indicates  that  electronic  oscillation  is  an  electromagnetic  action.

Furthermore,  if  we  treat 
current, then eq. (16) also indicates that a change in the density in region l is compensated 
by  a  net  change  in  flux  into  that  region.  This  agrees  with  quantum  mechanics  on 
probability.

As  electrons  are  oscillating  between  space and  time,  increasing  a  space  dimension  is 
accompanied by decreasing a time dimension, and vice versa. In other words, expansion of 
space is undergoing with release of time wrinkles whereas contraction of space results in 
condensation  of  time.  When  space  fully  unfolds,  it  loses  all  density  and  wraps  back 
according  to  its  cycle,  so  does  time.  Space  and  time  components  are  coupled  together  in 
such an intimate way that spacetime is a finite and yet unbounded continuum, which agrees 
with relativity. Here space is no more a three-dimensional volume, and time is no more a 
unidirectional flow. Two dimensions  refer  to  two  equally  and  complementarily  functional 
aspects of electrons, i.e. two modes in spacetime. Space still has X, Y, and Z orientations in 
Euclidean geometry, so does time. But it is more proper to adopt sine and cosine functions 
in  various  dimensions  (1,  ω,  v ,  r )  to  characterize  their  intricacy  than  to  use 
homogeneous X, Y, and Z coordinates with linear algebra. 

From the perspective of waves, if we regard each root, 

iΩ , as a waveform, then each 
electronic orbital is composed of two adjacent roots, and therefore covers two waveforms. 
Because every pair of adjacent roots are exactly one dimension apart, separated by either a 
time or a space dimension exactly, the two waveforms are orthogonal. An electronic wave 

 

4

propagates  from  one  waveform  to  another  following  eqs.  (12)  to  (15).  However,  a 
differential operation on a trigonometric function with respect to a time dimension, such as 
that  dictated  by  eq.  (12),  does  not  physically  happen  in  a  flash,  but  it  is  carried  out 
gradually and smoothly. When  αcos
  receives the differentiation order, the angle  α  is 
),  at  which  point  the  differential  operation 
then  rotating  gradually  up  to  (
completes. It goes without saying that the velocity of  α  rotation, or angular velocity  ω, 
determines  the  speed  of  the  differential  process  and  hence  the  period  of  electronic 
oscillating  cycle.  In  this  way,  we  have  explained  electronic  motion  by  calculus  and  the 
implementation of calculus by trigonometric functions. Mathematical expressions represent 
dynamic physical processes.

To  summarize,  this  section  started  from  mere  assumption  of  harmonic  oscillation  of 
two  electrons  in  helium  shell,  and  then  interpreted  complex  wavefunctions  in  terms  of 
possible  two  dimensional  spacetime  quantities.  Two  electrons  at  a  specific  moment 
constitute two basic dimensions, time and space, which are separated by π/2. For example, 
α  equals  0  while  the  other  electron

3.  Quaternity space   

 
We have initiated a new space and time concept in two-dimensional helium shell, but 
the  most  important  spacetime  is  of  four  dimensions.  The  best  way  to  delineate  a  four-
dimensional space is to give four geometric shapes corresponding to four space dimensions. 
To  this  end,  we  shall  examine  the  property  of  a  circle  and  a  spherical  layer  from  the 
standpoint of their centers.

correspondences  between  a  spherical  surface  and  two  flat  planes,  two  straight  lines,  and 
1P
two points. We shall identify the two points 
  as a one-dimensional geometric

Moreover, a solid sphere has one additional dimension in the radial direction compared 
with  a  spherical  surface,  so  it  contains  four  geometric  elements,  the  fourth  one  being  a 
radial vector that is orthogonal to the spherical surface. A spherical layer is an outer sphere 
minus  a  concentric  inner  sphere.  Thus,  two  radii,  two  planes,  two  lines,  and  two  points 
accurately  characterize  a  spherical  layer.  These  four  elements  constitute  four  orthogonal 
geometries. Here orthogonality means that quantities are not only mutually exclusive with 
π/2 radian angle interval but also of different space dimensions. 

As  we  study  a  spherical  layer,  the  outer  sphere  can  be  treated  as  an  unfolding  four-
dimensional  space  whereas  the  inner  sphere  is  a  zero-dimensional  point  encapsulating  all 
complexities within it. In Euclidean geometry, a point is assumed to be infinitesimal in size, 
but here we regard a point as possessing the size of the inner sphere, and lines and planes 
have  certain  thickness,  too.  The  outer  radius,  two  planes,  two  lines,  two  points,  and  the 
inner radius are four, three, two, one, and zero-dimensional elements, respectively, because 
they correspond to the highest dimension of an outer sphere, a spherical surface, a circle, 
two dislocated points, a concentric inner sphere, respectively (Fig 3).

If we start from a four-dimensional outer sphere 

, and reduce a dimension from it, 

0E

then we get a spherical surface 
. The immediate dimension that was reduced is a radial 
quantity. Such an action is like taking away 8000 from the number 8888 because a radial 
vector is a four-dimensional element. We express this process in a differential way (or in a 
quotient way) as:

It  is  interesting  to  find  that,  after  reducing  four  dimensions  sequentially,  a  sphere 
produces the same shape of different size. The four dimensions reduced are a radius, two 
planes,  two  lines,  and  two  points  in  sequence,  and  the  final  result  is  an  inner  sphere 
represented  by  a  smaller  radius.  An  outer  sphere  reducing  four  dimensions  sequentially 
results in a smaller sphere. Depending on the scope of concern, the inner sphere may serve 
as an outer sphere for further decomposition. Conversely, an outer sphere may serve as an 
inner  sphere  for  forming  an  even  larger  spherical  layer.  Thus  a  sphere  may  be  treated  as 
either a four-dimensional outer sphere or a zero-dimensional inner sphere. The differential 
operations from a larger sphere to another small sphere give scalability of the four elements, 
which can be repeatedly used for differentiating a large multiple-layered sphere.   

Four  space  elements  (radii,  planes,  lines,  points  in  Fig.  3)  that  we  defined  are  of 
various  spatial  significances.  This  is  somewhat  analogous  to  number  expression.  For 
example,  in  the  number  8888,  the  first  8  means  eight  thousand,  the  second  means  eight 
hundred, and so on and so forth, the four digits actually denote different magnitudes. In fact, 
it  is  such  a  kind  of  structural  grading  that  makes  it  feasible  to  express  a  large  number. 
Quaternity space follows the same logic. Four space elements form a ladder (i.e. four, three, 
two,  one,  and  zero)  in  terms  of  dimensional  magnitude,  which  is  contrary  to  Cartesian 
coordinates where dimensional properties of X, Y, and Z directions are assumed to be the 
same.  Due  to  their  scalability  and  grading,  quaternity  dimensions  make  it  feasible  to 
express spherical structures of multiple layers. Quaternity space means four distinct space 
dimensions  in  a  spherical  layer.  It  is  evident  that  the  atomic  space  such  as  neon  atom  is 
spherical  rather  than  linear.  So  it  is  our  intention  to  apply  this  new  space  concept  to 
electronic orbitals. 

 

4. Quaternity spacetime and rotation operation 

 
We  are  apt  to  take  it  for  granted  that  time  is  one-dimensional  and  space  is  three–
dimensional.  After  giving  up  this  presumption  and  treating  space  and  time  as 
complementary  and  symmetric  quantities,  we  get  four  kinds  of  space  and  time 
combinations  in  a  spherical  layer  (Tab.1).  The  outer  shell  of  a  neon  atom  is  a  spherical 

 

7

layer composed of eight electrons that can be expressed spatially by the octet: two spheres, 
two points, two lines, and two planes.   

The number of time dimension is  complementary  to  the  number  of  space  dimension. 
When the total dimensions are fixed for a given electron, the electron reducing a dimension 
in space inevitably increases a dimension in time accordingly, and vice versa. We define the 
medium of three-dimensional space with one-dimensional time as a vitor, meaning vitality; 
we  define  the  medium  of  two-dimensional  space  with  two-dimensional  time  as  a  metor, 
which connotes metamorphosis in the midway; and define the medium of one-dimensional 
space with three-dimensional time as a relator, which serves as a tendency reference. These 
three  quantities  are  all  curvilinear  vectors,  referring  to  different  space  and  time 
combinations.  We  use  a  scalar  to  refer  to  four-dimensional  space  with  zero-dimensional 
time of outer sphere or zero-dimensional space with four-dimensional time of inner sphere. 
We  may  associate  an  expanding  space  with  a  positive  scalar,  then  a  contracting  space  is 
associated with a negative scalar. Strictly speaking, a scalar in quaternity spacetime is also 
a  curvilinear  vector  because  it  is  dynamic  in  nature  and  has  an  expanding  or  contracting 
direction. Finally we define any of the four quantities, the scalar, the relator, the metor, and 
the vitor, as a quadrant.

Time and space are not necessarily symmetry in each quadrant, but when we consider 
four quadrants together, time and space are indeed symmetry. For example, the relator is in 
symmetry to the vitor with regard to space and time switch. The scalar of the inner sphere 
is in symmetry to the scalar of the outer sphere. And the metor, bearing two dimensions of 
space and two dimensions of time, is spacetime symmetry by itself.   

Within a spherical layer, each of the octet (the scalars, the vitors, the metors, and the 
relators)  contains  four  dimensions  of  space  or  time.  Space  and  time  dimensions  are 
complimentary so that the total number of dimensions in any quadrant remains four. For a 
specific  quadrant,  if  its  space  dimension  reduces,  then  its  time  dimension  must  increase 
accordingly,  and  vice  versa.  Space  and  time  components  are  interwoven  (Fig  4).  At  a 
specific moment in a dynamic spherical layer, a quartet of scalar, vitor, metor, and relator 
may experience space expansion with time rarefication while the other counterpart quartet 
may undergo space reduction with time condensation.

By  the  approach  of  analytic  geometry,  four  distinctive  quadrants  form  four  axes  of 
quaternity coordinates (Fig. 5) where every pair of adjacent axes are orthogonal and have a 
velocity interval. If the space dimension increases, then the time dimension should decrease 
in the meantime. If we denote the scalar axis  by  a  real  number,  then  the  other  three  axes 
have  spacetime  dimensions  of  v ,

Under quaternity spacetime, we shall consider the transformation of physical quantities 
between  space  and  time.  Given  a  fixed  number  of  dimensions  for  a  physical  entity, 
reducing  a  dimension  in  time  is  accompanied  by  increasing  a  dimension  in  space,  i.e.,  a 
differentiation upon a quadrant with respect to a time dimension must be accompanied by 
an  integral  operation  over  a  space  dimension,  and  vice  versa.  For  this  reason,  we  shall 
invent  rotation  operation  in  quaternity  spacetime  as  follows.  In  quaternity  coordinates,  a 
counterclockwise rotation of the home axis reduces a time dimension and increases a space 

dimension. If

  as  were  described  above,  and  dimension  t   has  the  same  implication.  For 
example,  if  the  current  home  axis  is  at  the  location  of  three-dimensional  time  with  one-

Furthermore,  as  was  demonstrated  in  eq.  (16),  electronic  transformation  follows 
rotation  operation.  It  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  5  that  rotating  the  home  axis  eight  times 
consecutively  brings  it  to  the  same  axis  position;  and  rotating  it  four  times  consecutively 
reaches the same axis but in the opposite direction. Since neon shell is an inert conservative

satisfy the following equations:

realize that both equations hold true no matter where its original home axis is. For example, 
if the home axis is at the four-dimensional time position, then the equations are for the time 
function 
.  Otherwise,  if  the  home  axis  is  at  the  three-dimensional  time  with  one-
dimensional space location, then the equations are for the spacetime function 
. Eq. (23)

which  is  called  quaternity  equation.  The  solution  to  it  will  give  wavefunctions  of  eight 
electrons in neon shell. Even though the eight electronic orbitals have four different kinds 
of space and time combinations, each of the scalars, the vitors, the metors, and the relators 
obeys eq. (24) individually and simultaneously. 

 

5. Electronic orbitals in neon shell 

 
Since electrons in neon shell occupy a spherical layer outside helium shell, in order to 
derive wavefunctions  for  2s2p  electrons,  we  build  an initial  function  upon  the  handler  of

quantities  are  at  the  same  quaternity  axis  but  in  the  opposite  directions,  which  are 
distinguished by a factor 

4v

. 

Physically, being in the opposite direction of  a  quaternity  axis  has  two  effects:  i)  the 
derivative  terms  in  eq.  (30)  are  positive  instead  of  negative  in  eq.  (26)  in  the  rotation 
operation pathway; and ii) rotation operation has  a  reverse  meaning,  i.e.,  reducing  a  time 
dimension  actually  means  reducing  a  space  dimension,  and  increasing  a  time  dimension 
means increasing a space dimension.   
i
,

            (32) 
 
This seemingly contradictory arithmetic can be understood in a simple way. For example, 
as  you  travel  towards  south,  after  passing  through  the  Antarctic  pole,  you  are  actually 
heading  towards  north  if  you  still  maintain  the  original  traveling  direction  of  “south”.

Similarly, wavefunctions exceeding the extremum of 
  begins to wrap back. In fact, we 
have seen in eqs. (14) and (15) that spacetime wrap back in the two-dimensional case, i.e., 
2Ω   actually  has  the  effect  of  increasing  a  time 
reducing  a  time  dimension  from 
dimension.  The  first  effect  is  really  a  corollary  to  the  second.  Because  in  the  opposite 

4v

direction  of  a  quaternity  axis,  the  derivative  with  respect  to  time  actually  means  the 
derivative  with  respect  to  space,  we  have  to  switch  the  minus  sign  in  the  former  into 
positive to satisfy the contrary tropisms of space and time dimensions. 

Wavefunctions  in  eqs.  (27)  and  (31)  form  four  pairs  of  electrons  with  opposite 
revolving directions, each pair being located at the same quaternity axis but in the opposite

From the standpoint of a specific electron, quaternity spacetime includes not only the 
current electron itself but also the other seven electrons in the past and future of the current 
electron, and the past and future states are interconnected forming the whole neon sphere. 
Eight electrons represent eight spacetime dimensions, which give dimensional graduations 
in spacetime, comprising spatial sphere of the history and future of a specific electron. The 
neon spacetime is a harmonic oscillation cycle featured by physical electrons. This cyclic 
spacetime worldview is more fundamental than linear Euclidean X, Y, and Z with infinitely 
long axes.

6. Dimension curling up mechanism 

 
This section is the most abstract and difficult part of the entire paper. As we derived 
  and 

wavefunctions  for  electrons  in  neon  shell,  we  simply  treated  1s  wavefunctions 
2Ω
  as  two  radian  angles  in  eq.  (25).  What  is  the  basis  for  this  usage?  And  what  is  the 
significance  of  trigonometric  functions?  First  of  all,  we  shall  clarify  the  relationship 
between  trigonometry  and  calculus.  The  relation  between  differential  operation  and 
trigonometric function can be expressed by

where 
α  angle from  α  to (π/2 +α), which of course results in the 
through the revolution of 
change  of  αcos
  in  the  end.  Thus,  we  may  express  a  differential 
operation in term of radian angle change. Since electronic motion is a dynamic process, we 
interpret  the  differential  operation  as  a  gradual  course.  Treating  α  as  a  continuously 
changing variable, we may omit the subordinate clause in eq. (34) and express a differential 
operation  by  a  trigonometric  function,  disregarding  whether  the  differential  process  is 
carried out completely or not. If it is completely done, then  α  increases the amount of π/2 
so  that  αcos
.  Traditionally,  we  associate  the  differentiation 
result of eq. (34) with the later term, and the initial condition with the former term. Since 
α  is  a  dynamic  variable,  the  difference  of  both  trigonometric  terms  is  a  matter  of  α

We  have  seen  in  eqs.  (27)  and  (31)  that  trigonometric  functions  may  express 
wavefunctions in more details than calculus formulae (26) and (30) in a spherical layer. We 
shall further explain this in situation connecting both 1s and 2s2p spherical layers. Looking 
at the left-hand side of eq. (34), we may interpret function  αcos
  as a  dynamic  fraction 
t
where the denominator is the magnitude of a full time dimension 
  and the numerator is 
.  The  partial  differentiation  notation  indicates  the  reduction

α  angle

process  of 
revolution  from  0  to  π/2.  Thus,  logically,  when  expressing  a  spacetime  component 
changing from a full dimension to vanishing, we may adopt cosine or sine operator upon a 
proper  radian  angle.  For  the  first  term  of  1s  wavefunction  in  helium  shell,  we  write  it  as 
. But how about the first term of 2s orbital in neon shell? We cannot use  α  any 
5C
more  because  it  is  a  radian  angle  measuring  the  internal  exchange  of  space  and  time 
components between two 1s electrons cyclically. To express a spacetime extension from 1s 
01Φ , representing the result of a 
to 2s, we write the first term of 2s electron as component 
0Ω   in  a  neon  atom, 
rotation  operation  from  1s  electron.  For  two-dimensional  quantity 
after performing rotation operation once, we have exhausted the time component contained 
within  it.  Therefore  further  differentiation  with  respect  to  time  must  be  performed  on  the 
0Ω   quantity  as  a 
whole  quantity  itself  and  expressed  as  cos
time radian in neon shell. By the same manner, we have

wavefunction  construction  confirmed  the  phenomena  of  dimensions  curling  up  and

defined quaternity spacetime in neon shell (Fig. 7).

7. Quaternity equation versus Schrödinger’s equation 
 

Quaternity  description  of  electronic  orbitals  is  not  only  self-consistent  but  also 
compatible  with  well-established  quantum  physics.  This  section  discusses  the  junction  of 
quaternity equations and Schrödinger’s equations and their divergence therefrom. We shall 
derive  a  common  heat  equation  from  both  two-dimensional  spacetime  concept  in  helium 
shell and Schrödinger’s one-orientational equation.   

On quaternity side, because space and time components are relative and symmetry in 
helium shell, the derivative of a wavefunction  Ω   with respect to time and  its  derivative 
with respect to space must be equal:

are converting between each other, the quantity of one electron is proportional to the rates

which  sees  three  dimensions  of  space  in  X,  Y,  and  Z  orientations.  By  using  Laplacian 

2∇

operator 
,  it  is  implied  that  electronic  orbitals  distribute  equally  in  X,  Y,  and  Z 
directions,  i.e.,  that  space  is  homogenous  and  isotropic.  Notwithstanding  this  impression, 
quantum mechanics traditionally handled Schrödinger’s equation by transforming Cartesian 
coordinates  into  spherical  polar  coordinates  pertinently  and  then  tried  to  derive  quantum 
information  under  the  constrains  that  the  equation  must  have  solutions  and  that  the 
solutions must be converged. Only via this transformation, it is successful in getting much 
useful information on electronic orbitals. 

In contrast, quaternity views the spaces represented by X, Y, and Z axes as possessing 
different levels of dimensions. As shown in Fig. 8, supposing that we are trying to locate a 
particular  seat  at  a  great  auditorium,  we  would  first  look  for  the  floor  number  as  was 
represented by Z direction, and then within the proper floor search the tier number as was 
represented by Y axis, and finally locate the X position in that tier. This simple logic is not 
beyond  our  everyday  living  experience,  but  mathematicians  so  far  have  not  caught  the 
significant difference between the three axes. Here, three-dimensional Z direction refers to 
the arrangement of all the floors, each of which contains multiple tiers; two-dimensional Y 
direction refers to the sequence of the tiers, each of which contains multiple seats; and one-
dimensional  X  direction  refers  to  the  order  of  seats.  The  wavefunctions  for  the  three 
orientations represent different meanings and constitute three orthogonal dimensions. The 
natural shifting of the dimensions from floor order, to tier order, to seat order in locating a 
particular  seat  at  the  auditorium  reflects  the  rule  of  quaternity  differentiation,  which  is 
always  operated  with  respect  to  the  most  immediate  dimension.  In  formulating  multi-
dimensional  wave  equations,  quaternity  climbs  up  to  higher  rank  of  derivatives  and  sees 

four  space  dimensions  in 
adopting Laplacian operator (also see eq. 24 and Fig. 4).

Since the second derivative contains the process of the first derivative, wave eq. (43) is 
actually  two-dimensional  in  helium  spacetime.  Moreover,  because  the  fourth  derivative 
term contains the operations of the third, second, and first derivatives, quaternity equation 
(24)  governs  electronic  oscillations  in  four  various  dimensions  indeed.  As  was 

 

 

17

demonstrated,  the  solution  to  this  wave  equation  gave  eight  electronic  wavefunctions  in 
neon shell. Electrons exist in various spacetime niches. In neon shell, eq. (24) means that 
performing  rotation  operations  on  an  electron  four  times  consecutively  returns  electronic 
state  to  the  same  quaternity  axis  but  in  the  opposite  direction;  and  performing  rotation 
operations eight times sequentially produces eight different electronic states that form 2s2p 
octet. 
 

8. Prediction and evidences of 2p-orbital geometries   

 
After describing the geometrical motion of 2s2p electrons, we have more confident to 
predict and retrodict the geometrical shapes of 2p-oribtals. Our description of 2px, 2py, and 
2pz-orbitals indicate that each orbital type is different geometrically. Assuming that electron 
cloud  distributes  in  X,  Y,  and  Z  orientations  equally  and  statically  cannot  explain  the 
orientation  of  2p-orbitals  in  carbon  atoms  that  form  methane,  ethylene,  and  ethyne 
molecules.  Hypothetical  orbital  hybridizations  are  traditionally  supplemented  for  those 
accounts.   

Quaternity  spacetime  describes  2p-orbitals  using  two  relators,  two  metors,  and  two 
vitors  that  have  different  geometric  shapes  in  spherical  polar  coordinates  ( ρ,  θ,  ϕ). 
Two  2s  orbitals  are  scalars  of  spherical  shape  defined  by  0< ρ<R  where  R  is  the  spatial 
radius of a neon shell. As shown in Fig. 9, a 2px is a relator of a linear vector in either pole 
constrained  by  0< ρ<R  and  (θ=0  or  π)  and  ϕ=π/2  in  spherical  polar  coordinates;  a 
2py  is  a  metor  of  a  planar  sector  bound  by  0< ρ<R  and  (0<θ<πor  π<θ<2π)  and 
ϕ=π/2;  and  a  2pz  is  a  vitor  of  hemispherical  shape  of  0< ρ<R  and  (0<ϕ<π/2  or 
π/2<ϕ<π).  There  are  various  geometrical  flexibilities  associated  with  each  orbital.  A 
free electron may also evolve dynamically from 2s to 2px, to 2py, to 2pz in sequence as was 
illustrated by eq. (33).   

 

Fig.  9  Profile  drawing  of  geometrical  shapes  of  2p-orbitals  in  three-dimensional 
Euclidean  where  2px  are  two  one-dimensional  vectors  (black);  2py  are  two  flat  sectors 
(gray); and 2pz are two hemispheres (white). 

 
The geometrical restrictions and dynamical flexibilities can explain molecule structure 
of  various  organic  molecules  without  recourse  to  orbital  hybridization.  For  example,  in  a 
methane molecule, carbon atom uses a 2s electron, a 2px electron, a 2py electron, and a 2pz 

 

 

18

electron to form σ-bonds with four hydrogen atoms. Because of the flexibility of electronic 
motion, each bond is restricted to a corner of a tetrahedron under electrical repulsions. But 
the  four  σ-bonds  are  all  different  due  to  different  natures  of  the  four  electrons.  This 
explains why four σ-bonds actually have unequal lengths at any moment.   

In an ethylene molecule, two carbon atoms form a stable 2px-2px σ-bond and a 2py-2py 
π-bond. Geometrically, the π-bond is the partial overlap of two 2py flat sectors in one atom 
with two 2py flat sectors in another atom (Fig. 10). It has less overlap than the σ-bond in 
the  middle  and  is  an  unsaturated  covalent  bond.  The  geometrical  orientation  of  2py 
electrons  to  accommodate  for  π-bond  and  the  geometrical  flexibility  of  2s  and  2pz  under 
electrical repulsion of the σ-bond and π-bond explain its planar molecular conformation. 

In  an  ethyne  molecule,  carbon  atoms  form  a  2px-2px σ-bond,  a  2py-2py π-bond,  and  a 
2pz-2pz π-bond. The  two  π-bonds  are  directional  oriented  and  are  of  different  energy,  one 
being  two  flat  sectors  partially  overlapping  two  flat  sectors,  the  other  being  two 
hemispheres  partially  overlapping  two  hemispheres  on  the  edges.  The  C-H  bonds  are 
oriented towards the opposite sides of the three bonds due to electrical repulsion, giving its 
linear  molecular  structure.  Thus  quaternity  description  of  electrons  in  a  carbon  atom 
naturally  accommodates  the  configuration  of  2p-orbitals  in  sp3,  sp2,  or  sp  hybridizations 
under special circumstances and shows great capacity in explaining the structure of various 
organic molecules. Orbital hybridization hypothesis is not needed in quaternity spacetime. 
The exact match of four quadrants with 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals is a basic evidence of 
quaternity spacetime.

(gray overlaps) in an ethylene molecule. 

 
In  addition,  the  asymmetrical  carbon  atom  (with  four  outer  electrons  of  2s,  2px,  2py, 
and  2pz  structures)  explains  well  with  regard  to  the  chirality  of  molecules  in 
stereochemistry.  A  chiral  molecule  is  a  molecule  that  is  non-superposable  on  its  mirror 
image. A pair of chiral enantiomers rotate the plane of polarization of plane-polarized light 
an equal amount, but in opposite directions. We believe that the spacetime differences of 2s, 
2px, 2py, and 2pz orbitals account for the light polarizations. Light bends due to spacetime 
curvatures  within  the  atomic  sphere.  This  phenomenon  was  observed  in  chiral  molecules 
only because chiral covalent bonds to an asymmetrical carbon atom prevent each of its four 
outer electrons from switching among 2s, 2px, 2py, and 2pz orientation states as it normally 
does  dynamically  (eq.  33)  so  that  the  molecule  bends  the  light  in  a  fixed  chirality.  The 
theory  of  quaternity  will  undoubtedly  provide  fresh  insight  into  the  configuration  of 
organic molecules and their reaction mechanisms as it penetrates into organic chemistry. 

9. Summary 

 
Quantum mechanics cannot describe in reasonable details on how electrons move 
within stable systems such as helium and neon atoms. We believe that this is not the 
problem  of  theory  construction,  but  the  limitation  of  its  undergirding  foundation  that 

 

19

we have taken it for granted. This foundation is Euclidean space (or Hilbert space) and 
Newtonian  time.  When  the  basement  of  space  and  time  concept  deviates  from  the 
reality, the entire establishment built upon it is flaw. However, since Euclidean space 
and Newtonian time are deeply ingrained in people’s mind and imagination and have 
dominated the knowledge base for thousands of years, changing them seems out of the 
question. This poses a daunting challenge for the introduction of quaternity spacetime.   
In  this  paper,  we  have  established  quaternity  spacetime  for  describing  electronic 
orbitals in a better precision than quantum mechanics. To specify, we explored space and 
time  concept  from  scratch  with  a  novel  mindset,  established  four  distinctive  space 
dimensions  in  a  spherical  layer  originally,  discovered  the  mechanism  for  dimensions 
curling  up  for  the  first  time,  examined  the  principle  of  rotation  operation  as  electronic 
transformation,  and  described  electronic  orbitals  with  four  curvilinear  quadrants  that 
oscillate simultaneously in four dimensions. Quaternity spacetime is a revolutionary idea in 
fundamental geometry and physics. 

Nevertheless,  quaternity  description  of  electrons  is  compatible  with  quantum  theory. 
Quaternity uses four pairs of curvilinear vectors for describing electronic states, which are 
in correspondence with four quantum numbers. The scalar defines a spherical layer, which 
corresponds to principal quantum number that accounts for energy level band; the vitor of 
conical  shape  corresponds  to  orbital  quantum  number  that  determines  the  magnitude  of 
orbital  angular  momentum;  the  metor  in  the  equatorial  plane  is  associated  with  magnetic 
quantum number; and the relator, having one space with three time dimensions, describes 
intrinsic  angular  momentum  perfectly.  These  conceptual  matches  constitute  an  additional 
interpretation  of  quantum  numbers.  This  alternative  spacetime  theory  has  been  fully 
expressed in a recent monograph [2].

Abstract 

We report the first results from an X-ray polarimeter with a micropattern gas proportional 
counter  using  an  amorphous  silicon  active  matrix  readout.    With  100%  polarized  X-rays  at  4.5 
keV,  we  obtain  a  modulation  factor  of  0.33  ±  0.03,  confirming  previous  reports  of  the  high 
polarization sensitivity of a finely segmented pixel proportional counter.  The detector described 
here has a geometry suitable for the focal plane of an astronomical X-ray telescope.  Amorphous 
silicon readout technology will enable additional extensions and improvements.

The  prospects  for  X-ray  polarimetry 
as a practical tool have been revolutionized by 
the  recent  introduction  of  an  instrument  with 
unprecedented sensitivity [1-3].  Based on the 
photoelectric  effect, 
type  of 
polarimeter  uses  a  finely  spaced,  gas  pixel 
detector to image the tracks of photoelectrons.  
Polarization 
is  obtained  by 
determining  the  angle  of  emission  of  the 
photoelectron,  which  is  correlated  with  the 
electric field vector of the X-ray.

The  primary  innovation  of  this  new 
polarimeter  is  the  introduction  of  a  pixel

photoelectron  tracks  can  be  imaged  and  the 
emission  angle  reconstructed  event-by-event.  
Combined  with  the  high  quantum  efficiency 
and  broad  bandpass  of  the  photoelectric 
effect,  this  non-dispersive  technique  gives 
dramatic  improvements  in  sensitivity  over 
polarimeters based on X-ray scattering [4]. 

Further  improvements  in  the  pixel

this  new  polarimetry

Photoelectron  track  images  were  recorded 
from  X-rays  of  energy  4.5,  5.9  and  20  keV.  
Polarization  measurements  were  made  with 
4.5 keV X-rays. 

The  detector,  shown  schematically  in 
Fig. 1, consisted of a double-GEM with 100-
 µm  hexagonal  pitch  and  a  TFT  pixel  anode 
with  100- µm  square  pitch.    The  active  area 
was  defined  by  the  double-GEM,  which  was 
12mm x 12mm.  Only a small fraction of the 
TFT array’s 512 x 512 pixels (about 25 cm2) 
was used.  No attempt was made to align the 
GEMs with each other or with the TFT array.

used  in  these  measurements.    The  sin2θcos2φ
distribution  of  photoelectron  emission 
for 
normally  incident  X-rays  is  projected  onto  the 
detector plane and observed as cos2φ.

detector  body  with  a  thin  polyimide  entrance 
window. 
  The  active  depth  was  3mm, 
determined  by  the  spacing  between  a  nickel 
mesh  drift  electrode  and  the  GEMs.    The 
spacing  between  GEMs  was  750  µm.    The 
spacing between the GEMs and the TFT array 
was  maintained  by  a  750  µm  thick  silicone 
gasket  that  also  acted  as  a  gas  seal.    The 
detector was operated as a flow counter using 
an  80%  neon,  20%  CO2  gas  mixture  at  an 
apparent  gain  of  about  104.    The  drift  field 
was 300 V/cm. 

The  GEMs  were  fabricated  by  UV 
laser  ablation  [9,10]  in  the  Laboratory  for 

2 

High  Energy  Astrophysics  at  NASA’s 
Goddard  Space  Flight  Center  (GSFC).  The 
GEMs  are  75  µm  thick  with  hole  diameters 
that  are  60  µm  at  the  electrodes,  constricting 
to 50 µm in the center of the substrate. 

The TFT pixel arrays were fabricated 
at  the  Palo  Alto  Research  Center  using  a 
process  scalable  to  large  areas  (~103  cm2).  
Each  pixel  contains  a  metal  anode  pad,  a 
storage  capacitor  of  about  0.4  pF  and  a  TFT 
switch.  The pixel design is described in more 
detail  elsewhere  [11,12].  The  source  of  the 
TFT  is  connected  to  the  anode  pad,  which  is 
isolated  from  the  rest  of  the  pixel  by  an 
insulation layer.  The anode pads cover about 
67%  of  the  surface  area.    The  TFT  gates  are 
connected  in  columns  and  the  drains  are 
connected in rows. 

With  the  TFT  switches  open,  charge 
from  the  GEMs  is  stored  on  the  anode  pads.  
To  read  out  the  array,  the  TFT  switches  are 
closed  column-by-column  by  activating  the 
gates lines, so that charge is transferred from a 
column  of  anode  pads  to  a  row  of  external 
amplifiers  [6].    Typical  operating  conditions 
turn on the TFT gate for 20–30 microseconds, 
which is nearly 10 times the RC time constant 
of  the  TFT  resistance  and  pixel  capacitance.  
The  signal  is  digitized  to  14  bits  using 
correlated  double  sampling.    Electronic  noise 
is  less  than  1000  electrons  (rms).    For  these 
measurements,  the  array  was  operated  in  a 
scanning mode at a frequency of 6 Hz. 

Fig.  2  shows  a  sample  of  tracks 
recorded  from  5.9  keV  X-rays.    The  non-
uniform  ionization  density  reveals  details

that large-area detectors of this type could be

At 4.5 keV, most of this fine structure 
is  obscured  by  the  diffusion  of  the  primary 
electrons  in  the  drift  volume  as  shown  in 
Figure 3.  Nevertheless, the track images have 
a discernable direction.   

Polarized  photons  were  produced  by 
reflecting  X-rays  at  90  degrees  off  a  silicon 
crystal.  The X-rays were produced by a tube 
with  a  titanium  anode  (Kα  =  4.5  keV).    Data 
were  collected  with  the  plane  of  X-ray 
polarization 
angles, 
separated by about 45 degrees, with respect to 
the detector.

The  polarized  data  were  analyzed  by 
reconstructing  the  emission  angle  of  each 
photoelectron.    Histograms  of  the  emission 
angles were then fit to the expected functional 
form: N(φ) = A + B cos2(φ - φ0), where φ0 is 
the  angle  of  the  plane  of  polarization  [13].  
The  sensitivity  to  polarization  is  defined  by 
the modulation: 

µ = (Nmax – Nmin)/(Nmax + Nmin) = B/(2A + B), 
where  Nmax  and  Nmin  are  the  maximum  and 
minimum of the function, respectively.   

The  photoelectron  emission  direction 
of  each  event  was  determined  by  calculating 
the  direction  of  the  major  axis  of  the  second 
moment  of  the  charge  distribution  about  its 
barycenter.  Only pixels above a threshold of

2000  electrons  were

calculation. 
refined  analysis, 
including only the charge near the interaction 
point [13], was not attempted.

shown, 

in  Fig.  4, 
demonstrate the polarization sensitivity of the 
detector.  The data fit the expected functional 
form  and  peak  around  the  independently 
measured polarization angle of the incident X-
rays.    All  three  data  sets  are  consistent  with 
the average modulation of 0.33 ± 0.03, which 
is  also  consistent  with  results  from  simulated 
data.  The fit parameters are given in Table 1.

would  allow 
stacking  of  multiple 
polarimeters  at  the  focus  of  an  X-ray  mirror, 
with each layer optimized for a higher energy 
than the one before.  In this way, the quantum 
efficiency  and  bandpass  of  the  instrument 
could be even further extended.

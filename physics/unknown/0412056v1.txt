Abstract 

This paper concerns the study of zirconium oxidation under irradiation with high energetic Xe 

ions.  The  irradiations  were  performed  on  the  IRRSUD  beam  line  at  GANIL  (Caen).  The 

oxygen partial pressure was fixed at 10-3 Pa and two temperature conditions were used, either 

480°C reached  by  Joule  effect heating or  280°C  due  to  Xe  energy  deposition.  Zirconia  was 

fully  characterized  by  Rutherford  Backscattering  Spectrometry,  Transmission  Electron 

Microscopy and Grazing Angle X-ray Diffraction. Apparent diffusion coefficients of oxygen 

in ZrO2 were determined from these experiments by using a model which takes into account a 

surface exchange between oxygen gas and the ZrO2 surface. These results are compared with 

thermal oxidation data.

I. INTRODUCTION  

This paper deals with the influence of heavy ion irradiation on the oxidation kinetics 

of zirconium. This study is performed in the framework of long-term storage of nuclear spent 

fuel.  In  France,  Zircaloy  is  used  as  cladding  material  in  Pressured  Water  Reactors.  During 

reactor operation, it is well established that the oxidation process occurs on both sides of the 

zircaloy tube. Whereas the outer side of the tube is oxidized in contact with water, the inner 

surface is oxidised in a dry atmosphere. Evermore the fuel cladding inner surface is submitted 

to neutrons, alpha, gamma and fission product irradiation. The characteristics of the so formed 

oxide  will  influence  the  long  term  behaviour  of  the  spent  fuel  assembly  in  case  of  direct 

storage without reprocessing. 

The  corrosion  behaviour  of  zirconium  alloys  as  cladding  materials  has  been  so  far 

discussed for many years. A number of review papers has been published on this subject1, 2. It 

has been established that thermal oxidation kinetics of zirconium and zircaloy at atmospheric 

pressure obeys a parabolic or cubic law preceding the linear one. In the pretransition step, the 

oxide film growth mechanism is the migration of oxygen through the corrosion film with the 

formation  of  a  new  oxide  at  the  metal-oxide  interface3.  This  mechanism  has  been  modelled 

and compared to experimental data4. Let us remind that the zirconia crystallographic structure 

presents  three  polymorphs  of  ZrO2.  At  atmospheric  pressure  zirconia  is  monoclinic  below 

1300 K. Around 1400 K, a phase transition occurs and the crystal takes a tetragonal structure. 

Near  2600  K  a  second  phase  transition  leads  to  the  cubic  structure.  In  the  500-1100  K 

temperature  range,  the  crystalline  structure  of  the  oxide,  formed  in  the  pretransition  state 

during  thermal  oxidation,  is  monoclinic  with  a  proportion  of  tetragonal  phase  stabilized  by 

local stress fields5, 6. Although irradiation effects with heavy ions in pure monoclinic or doped 

zirconia have drawn attention7, 8, 9, 10, up to our knowledge available data on radiation effects 

on zirconia formation are restricted to neutron11 and electron12 irradiations.

Using the reactor of the Institut Laue Langevin in Grenoble (ILL), we have recently 

observed an increase of the oxidation rate mainly induced by fission product irradiation13. The 

experiments  of  oxidation  under  irradiation  performed  with  the  high  neutron  flux  reactor  at 

ILL used the following conditions: a pressure in the H9 beam line of 5x10-3 Pa, a temperature 

of  480°C,  a  neutron  flux  of  5x1014  n  cm-3  s-1  and  the  fission  rate  was  about  1011  s-1.  The 

oxidation  rate  was  measured  by  fission  fragment  spectroscopy  on  line.  At  the  end  of  the 

experiment,  after  an  irradiation  time  of  122  hours,  it  was  shown  that  the  whole  Zr  foil  was 

completely oxidised corresponding to an oxide thickness of 3.1 µm and a stoichiometry close 

to ZrO2. The determination of this stoichiometry is given with an accuracy of approximately 

10%.  

As post-irradiation characterisation of the so formed oxide was not possible due to a 

very  high  radioactivity,  the  results  needed  to  be  confirmed  by  further  experiments.  For  that 

purpose,  we  have  chosen  to  study  the  zirconium  oxidation  kinetics  under  heavy  ion 

irradiation.  This  choice  was  supported  by  Hj.  Matzke  results  which  have  experimentally 

demonstrated  that  enhancement  of  self-diffusion  in  UO2  pellets  in  reactor  conditions  was 

mainly due to the defects and the morphologic changes induced by slowing down of fission 

products14,15. 

The  aim  of  the  present  paper  is  to  model  the  zirconium  oxidation  kinetics,  under 

fission product irradiation only, represented by 0.5 MeV/u xenon ions. The irradiations were 

performed on GANIL accelerator in Caen. The oxidation rate under irradiation is compared to 

thermal data obtained in the same pressure and temperature conditions in order to evaluate the 

damage role. The evolution of the crystallographic structure is also discussed.

II. RADIATION ENHANCED OXIDATION UNDER Xe IRRADIATION 

A. Experimental procedure 

 

i) Irradiation conditions 

The irradiations were performed on the IRRSUD beam line at GANIL accelerator. A 

129Xe beam was used at a kinetic energy of 64.5 MeV and at a flux of  2.6x1010 Xe cm-2 s-1. 

An  irradiation  cell  was  specifically  realized  for  the  experiments,  which  allows  to  control 

precisely pressure and temperature (figure 1a). As shown in figure 1b, the target is made of 6 

µm thick zirconium foils which are positioned on a copper support. A tantalum resistance can 

heat  the  target  by  Joule  effect  up  to  500°C.  To  maintain  the  resistance  electric  isolation,  a 

mica plate is inserted between copper and tantalum. The whole set is fixed on stainless steel 

on which is placed thermocouple. A variable power supply allows to control the intensity into 

the resistance, and to fix the target temperature. Two experimental conditions were used either 

by  heating  the  zirconium  foil  at  480°C  or  without  exterior  thermal  heating.  In  this  last 

condition, the ion energy deposition leads to a target temperature of 280°C. 

The  pressure  of  5x10-3  Pa  was  controlled  with  a  microleak  and  a  1.5  µm  thick  aluminum 

window was placed between the irradiation cell and the IRRSUD beam line in order to avoid 

any pressure degradation in the beam line. The Xe beam kinetic energy after crossing the Al 

window is 50 MeV which corresponds to a Xe range in Zr equal to 5.7 µm. 

The zirconium foils were irradiated during different times up to 47 hours which allows to vary 

the studied fluences between 0.25 and 4x1015 Xe cm-2.  

ii) X-ray Diffraction analysis 

Grazing  angle  X-ray  diffractometry  was  used  to  obtain  the  volumic  proportion  of 

monoclinic  and  tetragonal  zirconia  phases  induced  as  a  function  of  the  xenon  fluence. 

Measurements were performed at the Ecole Centrale of Lyon. The incident X-ray beam angle 

 

 

 

4

was 2° which allows the analysis of the first 600 nm. The volume fraction C of the tetragonal 

zirconia phase is obtained by measuring the intensity of the tetragonal (111) ray (31.5°) and of 

the monoclinic ( 1 11) ray (28.17°), according to 16,17:

where  It(111) is the (111) ray intensity and Im( 1 11) is the ( 1 11) ray intensity. 

B. Experimental results 

For  each  temperature  and  fluence,  the  oxide  layer  thickness  was  determined  using 

Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry using α particles between 2 and 6 MeV energies on 

the 4 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the IPNL. 

Figure 2 displays two typical RBS spectra obtained on a Zr sample irradiated at 480°C during 

5 and 13 hours. By fitting the experimental RBS spectra, we deduced first the stoichiometry 

of the formed oxide and the oxide thickness. We found a ZrO2 stoichiometry and 270 and 680 

nm  thickness  respectively  for  5  and  13  hours  irradiation  times.  Secondly,  this  technique 

allows  to  determine  the  oxygen  gain  G  for  each  irradiation  time  and  consequently,  the 

oxidation  kinetics  of  zirconium  for  both  temperatures.  Tables  1  and  2  summarize  all  the 

results obtained as a function of fluence on samples irradiated at 480 and 280°C.  

The image obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the sample irradiated at the 

highest fluence of 4.4x1015 Xe cm-2 (figure 3), clearly shows that the oxidation occurs only on 

the face regarding the beam and that the sample is completely dense and uniform even after 

the longest irradiation. This last observation seems to prove that the oxide layer remains in a 

pre-transition phase. 

In  order  to  characterize  the  different  zirconia  structures  formed  as  a  function  of  the 

irradiation  conditions,  a  grazing  angle  X-ray  diffraction  (GAXRD)  analysis  was  performed.

Whereas most authors have investigated phase transformation of zirconia under irradiation7-10, 

the  originality  of  this  work  is  to  study  the  irradiation  induced  effects  on  the  as-growing 

zirconia structural evolution. An illustration of obtained X-ray spectra is presented in figure 4. 

From  the  relation  (1),  the  relative  volumic  percentages  of  tetragonal  phase  have  been 

calculated for each fluence and temperature. They are reported in tables 1 and 2 and plotted in 

figure  5.  At  280°C,  only  the  tetragonal  phase  is  observed  whereas,  at  480°C,  a  mixture  of 

tetragonal  and  monoclinic  phases  is  found  (50%  of  each  already  for  the  1.2x1015  Xe  cm-2 

fluence).  

We  have  calculated,  from  the  plot  of  Ln  G    as  a  function  of  Ln  t,  that  the  time 

dependence of the oxidation kinetics law is in t0.88 and t0.75 respectively at 480 and 280°C. It 

shows  that  we  are  not  in  the  classical  case  of 

t dependence,  observed  in  case  of  thermal 

oxidation.  An  illustration  is  given  in  figure  6  which  represents  the  oxidation  kinetic  law  at 

480°C. As the oxidation kinetics is linear above an irradiation time of 10 hours, we deduced 

in first approximation oxidation rates equal to 1.9 and 2.1x1017 O at. cm-2 h-1 respectively at 

From these observations, a model will be developed further in this paper, which allows to fit 

280 and 480°C.  

the oxygen gain under irradiation. 

III. THERMAL OXIDATION STUDY 

In previous works13, 18, 19, we have studied thermal oxidation at reduced (PO2 = 10-3 Pa ) 

and atmospheric (PO2 = 2x104 Pa) pressures. The annealing conditions (time and temperature 

range)  were  chosen  in  order  to  study  the  pre-transition  oxidation  kinetics  for  which  the 

mechanism of oxide growth is known to be related to oxygen migration through the oxidation 

film. The sample weight gain measurements were performed by the thermogravimetry method 

and RBS. The details of the experimental procedure are given in references18, 19.

The  apparent  oxygen  diffusion  coefficients  D  were  deduced  from  the  measurements, 

assuming  that  the  oxide  growth  is  limited  by  a  pure  oxygen  diffusion  process  through  the 

existing oxide layer. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is thus:

where D0 is the pre-exponential factor, k is the Boltzmann constant (8.617x10-5 eV.K-1), T the 

temperature,  Ea  the  activation  energy  (eV.at-1).  The  D0  and  Ea  values  for  each  pressure  are 

obtained by the least square fitting of the Arrhenius plot. The results are summarized in table 

3.  In  addition,  the  sample  structure  was  studied  by  X  ray  diffractrometry.  This  technique 

showed  that,  in  the  350-480°C  temperature  range,  the  growing  zirconia  layer  consisted  in 

monoclinic (80 %) and tetragonal (20%) zirconia. 

Our  results  have  been  compared  with  data  from  the  literature20-27  (figure  7).  For  this 

comparison  we  have  selected  data  obtained  in  tetragonal  and  monoclinic  zirconia  at 

atmospheric  pressure.  Diffusion  coefficients  in  tetragonal  zirconia  have  been  measured  by 

using the tracer technique while in monoclinic zirconia, most data have been obtained from 

oxidation growth experiments. Figure 7 puts forward the following points: 

i) 

There  is  a  continuity  between  oxygen  thermal  diffusivity  in  tetragonal  (dashed 

lines) and monoclinic (full lines and dots) zirconia. 

ii) 

The  slopes  of  the  Arrhenius  plots  are  close  one  to  each  other,  whatever  the 

crystallographic structure. The deduced activation energies stand around 1.1 ± 0.3 

eV at-1. This value is interpreted as oxygen diffusion through oxygen vacancies in 

the ZrO2 lattice. 

iii) 

Concerning  our  data  obtained  at  two  oxygen  partial  pressures  different  of  seven 

orders of magnitude, the measured diffusion coefficients vary only by one order of

magnitude. From the two measurements at 450°C, we have deduced a dependency

IV. RADIATION ENHANCED OXIDATION STUDY 

Experimental results under irradiation differ from thermal results by two main points: 

(i) the non-

t  diffusion dependence, 

(ii) a surface oxygen concentration which is time dependant due to the irradiation process. 

Hence,  we  propose  to  consider  both  the  oxygen  radiation  enhanced  diffusion  D*  and  the 

reaction constant K (cm.s-1) at the surface. In this approach, the Fick’s second law resolution

The correct D* and h values are obtained by fitting the result of the model to the experimental 

kinetics using the MINUIT programme31. An illustration of such a simulation is presented in 

figure 8. The values of D* and K are given in table 4. 

K is a kinetics constant characteristic of a surface exchange between residual oxygen gas and 

the zirconia solid surface. We found K values of the order of 10-9 cm s-1 for 280 and 480°C. 

This  value  is  comparable  to  that  given  by  Kilo  et  al.32  and  Tannhauser  et  al.33  for  thermal 

isotopic  oxygen  exchange  at  the  zirconia  surface  in  the  500-700°C  temperature  range.  This 

last author even underlined the very low dependence of K with temperature. 

V. DISCUSSION 

The Arrhenius plots corresponding to oxygen diffusion both thermal and under irradiation are 

presented in figure 9 in the 280-480°C temperature range. As D*= Dirr + Dth

3, D* is very close 

to  Dirr  (see  table  4).  In  addition,  taking  into  account  the  errors,  around  50%,  deduced  from 

MINUIT  programme,  the  D*  values  are  similar  at  480  and  280°C.  It  puts  forward  that  the 

enhanced  oxidation  due  to  defects  created  by  the  Xe  ions  is  not  thermally  activated  in  this 

temperature range. 

Despite the predominance of the electronic stopping power, we make the hypothesis that the 

diffusion  process  under  irradiation  is  enhanced  by  the  displacement  cascades.  We  have 

estimated  the  oxygen  diffusion  coefficient  in  ZrO2,  Dirr,  generated  by  Xe  ions  as  usually 

considered by the Einstein relation34:

where R is the root-mean square displacement of an oxygen atom in the collision cascade, 

Γ is the jump rate proportional to the atomic displacement rate F in dpa s-1 (Γ=αF, where α 

corresponds to the number of atomic jumps per displacement). 

From SRIM calculation35, we deduced: R = 390 nm and F = 3x10-5 dpa s-1.  

The  Dirr  experimental  values  were  reproduced  by  using  equation  (6)  in  which  α  is  equal  to 

135  or  87  respectively  at  480°C  and  280°C.  These  rather  high  values  are  comparable  to 

Müller’s ones34 who conclude to a significant influence of the collision cascade. 

VI. CONCLUSION 

We  have  measured  the  zirconium  oxidation  rate  under  50  MeV  Xe  irradiation  in  order  to 

simulate the fission product energy slowing down in nuclear fuel claddings. These data have 

been  interpreted  by  using  a  model  developed  by  Crank30.  Thus  apparent  oxygen  diffusion 

coefficients enhanced by irradiation have been deduced as well as oxygen surface exchange 

constants. In the studied temperature range, the comparison between D* and thermal D values 

put forwards two important results: first, the oxygen diffusivity in ZrO2 under Xe irradiation 

is athermal, second, it is strongly enhanced by a factor 6x104 at 280°C.

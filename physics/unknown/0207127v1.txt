1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Experiments involving slow1 and fast2-7 light have motivated various theoretical in-
vestigations8,9  that  interpret  the  phenomena  arising  from  dispersion  and  dissipation  in 
optical systems.  Previously, we showed that the interpretation of these phenomena often 
referred to in the literature were intrinsically associated with incomplete energy account-
ing.9  Specifically, we showed that for a dissipative dielectric, 1) there is an unambiguous 
notion of the total energy of the medium-field system, and 2) this total energy can in no-
wise demonstrate “fast” dynamics, neither locally nor globally. 

This  otherwise  satisfying  result  is  tempered  by  the  realization  that  the  total  energy 
contains  a  component  which is “dynamically unrecoverable,” and should be viewed ei-
ther as a static component of a closed system, or as part of a continual loss from an open 
system.    In  a  closed  system  the  “dynamically  unrecoverable”  energy  is  like  a  trail  of 
bricks left behind a wagon; stationary pieces that are still part of the wagon-brick system.  
In the open system we think of the dropped bricks as having returned to the earth; once 
dropped they are no longer considered part of the wagon-brick system.  Either viewpoint 
cheapens  the  result  that  total  energy  transport  is  luminal;  one  might  suppose  that  lu-
minality  is  only  a  consequence  of  a  component  which  is  either  not  moving  at  all  or  is 
completely  lost  from  the  system’s  energy  accounting  and  whose  transport  properties 
should not be considered in the first place.  In this work we do not address the question of 
luminality  of the dynamically recoverable energy.  Instead, we consider the heretofore-
unsolved problem of unambiguously separating the recoverable from the unrecoverable 
energy in a general linear dielectric medium.

We use ideas from Landau and Lifshitz [LL]10 and Oughstun and Sherman [OS]11 by 
which the static component of energy is interpreted as the heat dissipated to the medium.  
[LL] explicitly make this interpretation, in the case of an arbitrary medium and arbitrary 
process, only in the limit of large time, while [OS] indicate that such a notion should exist 
at  any  time.    In  this  sense  [OS]  consider  a  notion  of  heat  production  that  is  manifestly 
dynamical.    [LL]  establish  a  dynamical  notion  of  internal  energy  (the  sum  of  heat  and 
free  energy;  the  total  energy),  but  they  quickly  restrict  to  the  non-dispersive  case,  and 
proceed  to  define  it  as  the  difference  between  (some  fixed  notion of)  the  medium-field 
energy  with  and  without  the  history  of  the  instigating  fields.    They  deem  this  type  of 
definition as being thermodynamically significant.  Of course, as they point out, the non-
dispersive case is also the (macroscopically) conservative case.  Consequently in the case 
they consider there can be no notion of heat dissipated, neither dynamically nor asymp-
totically.  Therefore the total energy is just the free energy.  Moreover [LL] continue by 
indicating  that  such  a  thermodynamically  significant  notion  of  (dynamical)  internal  en-
ergy probably cannot exist for a dissipative system.  From the open system viewpoint this 
postulate is valid.  Returning to the brick-wagon analogy, if one stops accounting for lost 
bricks, then the total amount of bricks in the brick wagon system is constantly changing; 
bricks are no longer conserved.  Consequently, with no notion of dynamical internal en-
ergy, they do not prescribe a meaningful notion of its components, free and heat energy. 

In  this  paper  we  define  the  dynamical  free  and  heat  energy  in  a  stationary,  causal, 
and purely dissipative medium (a simple medium).  We show how the definition 1) vindi-
cates  a  certain  component  of  the  viewpoint  of  [OS],  namely  that  there  is  a  meaningful 
notion of dynamical heat production, 2) creates a thermodynamically significant notion of 
total energy, generalizing the [LL] notion of internal energy, and 3) makes connections 
with intuitive properties for the simple Lorentz model and validates the interpretation of 
those properties.

where we have restricted to the scalar case, in order to simplify the following discussion. 
The first two terms in Eq. (1) give the electromagnetic field energy density, and the 
last term represents the energy density stored in the coupled medium-field system.  We 
refer  to  this  third  component  as  the  interaction  energy  and  denote  it  as  u
  (previ-
ously we called this the exchange energy

int.( )t

12).   

The change in the free energy in a reversible isothermal process is defined as the dif-
ference between the change in the internal energy and the change in the heat energy dur-
ing this process.  An immediate consequence of this definition is that this change in free 

REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE PROCESSES IN OPTICAL MEDIA

energy is equivalent to the work done on the system.  Since the process is reversible, this 
work done by some external agent on the system is equivalent to the work the system can 
do  on,  or  return  to,  the  agent.    We  generalize  this  idea  to  irreversible/dissipative/non-
equilibrium processes by defining the dynamical free energy in all cases to be the work 
the system can do on, or return to, an external agent.  This generalized notion of free en-
ergy thus defined reduces to the classical notion in the reversible case. 

It can be shown that the first two terms in Eq. (1) always constitute energy (density) 
that  the  medium-field  system  can  return  to  a  causal  agent.    Thus  these  first  two  terms 
always constitute a component of the dynamical free energy just defined.  Consequently 
our search for the total dynamical free energy can be restricted to a discussion of the third 
term,  the  interaction  energy 
.    Though  our  generalization  of  the  free  energy  is 
manifestly dynamical, in the following we will abbreviate and refer to this non-equilib-
rium object as, simply, the free energy.

[OS]  claim  that  u

  should  in  principle  be  decomposed  into  two  pieces,  one  of 
which  represents  energy  stored  in  the  medium  “reactively”  (their  term),  the  other  of 
which represents energy stored “latently” (our term).  The free energy is then the sum of 
the field energy term and the reactive energy term.  The heat energy corresponds to the 
latent term of the interaction energy.  We will define and then find the reactive and latent 
energy terms. 

Utilizing a theorem from our previous work,9 we first rewrite the interaction energy

  We note that by the work of [LL],  u

tion  (2)  generalizes  this  result  and  shows  that  a  passive dielectric also has the property 
that the energy of interaction never runs a deficit at any finite time:  u

to make an unambiguous, dynamical separation of this term into reactive and latent en-
ergy pieces.

A  physically  relevant  and  unambiguous  way  to  separate  the  interaction  energy  at 
each time t, for any field 
 and any susceptibility (of a simple dielectric), into “reac-
tive”  and  “latent”  pieces,  is  to reinterpret  “reactive,”  to  mean  reversible.  We  make  this 
notion  precise  by  extending  a  well-accepted  interpretation.    In  the  [LL]  interpretation

Thus,  from  the  computational  point  of view, the complement of this component of 
the  total  interaction  energy  is  more  fundamental.  For  the  time  being  we  will  call  this 
complement the irreversible energy:

example, the sequence (1, .5, .25, .125, .0625, … ) has infemum equal to zero though no minimum exists.  
The supremum and infemum, however, are the maximum and minimum, respectively, of a series if the 
maximum or minimum exist.

Because 

δ ω is analytic in the lower half plane, but is otherwise arbitrary, Eq. 
(10) is impossible unless the rest of the integrand is also analytic in the lower half plane.  
If the entire integrand is analytic and rapidly vanishing in the lower half plane, we can 
obtain the integral in Eq. (10) by extending the contour with an arbitrarily large half-cir-
cle in the lower half plane.  From Cauchy’s theorem, the integral over the whole contour 
will be zero.  Because the integrand is rapidly vanishing at infinity, the integral over the 
half-circle will go to zero as we extend the radius to infinity.  This ensures that, regard-
less of the form of an admissible variation, that the integral over the real axis (in Eq. (10)) 
is zero.  By defining a new quantity  ˆZ (

3. SOLUTION FOR A SINGLE LORENTZ OSCILLATOR 
 

In this section we utilize the definition for reversible and irreversible energy to find 
the reversal field, and consequently, the reversible and irreversible energies for a single 
species Lorentz oscillator.  While the quantities associated with free energy and heat have 
been  known  for  a  dissipative  Lorentz  oscillator  model  of  a  medium  since,  at  least,  the 
work  of  Loudon  in  1970,14  we  pursue  the  trivial  Lorentz  model  to  reinforce  Loudon’s 
interpretation for a well-known model of a medium.  However, we have found the intui-
tive method used by Loudon for the single Lorentz oscillator model cannot determine the 
free and heat energy in general.  That method involves determining the kinetic and po-

tential energies of the components of the system and calling the sum of those free energy, 
and ascribing all other forms to energy dissipation.  We have found, for the next simplest 
case  of  a  double  species  Lorentz  oscillator,  for  all  times 
  (except  infinity)  the  kinetic 
and potential energies are always greater than the reversible energy.  As will be examined 
15 in which we consider general (non-Lorentzian) me-
closely in an upcoming publication,
dia, the reason for this is the effective irreversibility of (microscopic) decoherence among 
system elements.

In contrast to the general method of solution, for a single Lorentz oscillator it is eas-

problem  to  find  the  reversal  field  (the  solution  to  Eq. (11) with associated constraints).  
Once factored, the theorem from complex analysis dictating that bounded entire functions 
are constants gives the solution.  The entire derivation will not be presented in this paper.

Equation  (20) defines a family, in  ε, of reversal fields for each time 

.  With the 
reversal field for each positive 
, there is an associated [LL] asymptotic heat.  The infe-
mum of these [LL] asymptotic heats, as ε goes to zero, is the irreversible energy at time 
ε approaches arbitrarily close to zero the [LL] asymptotic heat (for the past/quasi-
t
reversal concatenated field) approaches arbitrarily close to the infemum that defines the 
irreversible energy.  Figures 1(b) and 1(e) on the following page emphasize that reversal 
fields with smaller 
 yield [LL] asymptotic heats that approach closer to the irreversible 
ε
energy.  However, as 
 gets smaller, it takes longer to realize the [LL] asymptotic heat 
ε
for the past/quasi-reversal concatenated field.  Figures 1(c) and 1(f) show that the interac-
tion  energy  for  a  past/quasi-reversal  field  with  smaller 
  takes  longer  to  approach  its 
final asymptotic value.

Consequently, for ε arbitrarily close to zero, time must run arbitrarily close to infin-
ity  to  realize  the  evolved  heat.    This  means  that  when  actually  finding  the  irreversible

Equation (26) shows that the reversible energy for a single Lorentz oscillator is the 
sum of its kinetic and potential energy.  However, in general (i.e. for an arbitrary suscep-
tibility), the reversible energy is not equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energies 
of (microscopic) system elements, but is found, generically, to be less than that sum.  As 
mentioned previously, this is due to the effective irreversibility of decoherence among 
system elements.

We will now demonstrate that the definitions we have made for reversible and irre-
versible  (interaction)  energy  not  only  have  the  properties  their  names  suggest,  but  also 
always have the properties defining, classically, free energy and heat.  Of course we have 
defined the first of these quantities in such a way as to establish it as the supremum on the 
amount  of  work  the  medium  can  do  against  the  field  and,  so,  since  one  defines  (the 
change in) the free energy of a body thermodynamically as the work done on a body in a 
reversible isothermal process, the use of the term is justified from this semantic point of 
view.  Better, however, is the fact that one can show that from the classic definition of 
free energy, in an irreversible isothermal process, volume also being held constant, free 
energy always decreases.  The restrictions just stated amount to those that prohibit an in-
troduction of total energy into the system.  In the following, we will show that, after the 
instigating electric field has ceased subsidizing the reversible energy’s existence, i.e. after 
the electric field ceases to introduce energy into the medium-field system, this component 
of the total energy can never increase and, moreover, decreases almost always. 

The way that we will establish this result, however, is by showing first the easier fact 
that the irreversible energy never decreases and increases almost always regardless of the 
state  of  the  field 
.    In  this  way  we  establish  this  component  of  the  energy  as  re-
cording  the  irreversibility  of  the  process  defining  the  medium-field  interaction,  at  least 
from an energetic point of view.  This will be our justification for calling this component 
heat. 

E( )t

t

The  proof  that  the  irreversible  energy  cannot  decrease  requires  no  calculation,  and 
follows directly from the definition of the irreversible energy, namely that, at a specific 
time 
, it is the infemum of the interaction energy after this time: obviously if these dy-
namically calculated infima were to ever decrease after time  t , the original (now candi-
date) value for the infemum at time  t  would not have been an extrema after all. The only 
calculation-like  statement  that  needs  be  made  is  that  such  an  infemum  is  guaranteed  to 
exist. This is assured by Eq. (2) which shows that the total interaction energy is positive 
definite, i.e. it can never obtain a value smaller than zero—see the paragraph after Eq. (2) 
alluding  to  this  necessity.  Having  proved  this  fact  regarding  the  dynamics  of  the  irre-
versible energy, from now on we will call it the (dynamical) heat, and will denote it as

5. SUMMARY 
 

In this paper we have provided the essential definitions and concepts that allow for a 
general  solution  to  the  dynamical  separation  of  free  and  heat  energy first alluded to by 
[LL] in 1958, and later posed concretely by [OS] in 1994.  We have vindicated a certain 
component of the viewpoint of [OS]: there is a meaningful notion of dynamical heat pro-
duction.    We  have  shown,  contrary  to  the  viewpoint  of  [LL],  that  there  is  a  thermody-
namically significant notion of internal (or total) energy for dissipative systems, and we 
have extended [LL]’s well known definition regarding evolved, asymptotic heat to pose a 
definition for the dynamical free energy and heat.  This definition states that the amount 
of  free  energy  in  a  system  is  the  field  energy  plus  the  mechanical  energy.    In  turn,  the 
mechanical energy is defined as the supremum of all possible changes in the internal en-
ergy of the medium.  Consequently, heat is equivalent to the infemum of all possible fu-
ture  internal  energies.    We  have  applied  this  definition  to  the  single  Lorentz  oscillator 
model of a dielectric and have shown that it verifies the interpretation of Loudon involv-
ing an intuitive decomposition of dynamical free energy and heat.  Lastly, we have shown 
for an arbitrary simple dielectric, that the definitions posed for dynamical free energy and 
heat yield the properties that characterize them classically.  

In  forth-coming  works  we  will  present  the  development  of  dynamical  mechanical 
energy and heat for arbitrary simple dielectrics,13 demonstrate that mechanical energy is 
almost always less than the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the microscopic 
elements  comprising  the  system,15  and  discuss  the  application  of  these  concepts  to  su-
per/subluminal phenomenon.16

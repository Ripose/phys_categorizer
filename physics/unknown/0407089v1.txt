Abstract - The holographic imaging of rigid objects with diode lasers emitting in 

many wavelengths in a sillenite Bi12TiO20 photorefractive crystal is both theoretically and 

experimentally investigated. It is shown that, due to the multi-wavelength emission and the 

typically  large  free  spectral  range  of  this  light  source,  contour  fringes  appear  on  the 

holographic image corresponding to the surface relief, even in single-exposure recordings. 

The  influence  of  the  number  of  emitted  modes  on  the  fringe  width  is  analysed,  and  the 

possible applications of the contour fringes in the field of optical metrology are pointed out.

Holographic  recording  with  photorefractive  media  has  been  found  many 

applications  in  the  fields  of  fundamental  and  applied  research  [1].  Due  to  very  important 

characteristics, like reversible recording with unlimited number of recording-erasure cycles, 

high  image  resolution  and  high  storage  capability,  the  photorefractive  materials  are 

currently  of  great  interest  in  areas  like  information  storage  [2],  pattern  recognition  [3], 

phase conjugation [4], optical image processing [5] and optical metrology [6,7].  

Macroscopic parameters like response time, typical diffraction efficiency, response 

to  wavelength,  birefringence  and  optical  activity  distinguish  the  photorefractive  materials 

from each other. These parameters determine the choice of the most suitable material for a 

specific  application.  Among  the  photorefractive  crystals,  the  sillenite  crystals  (Bi12SiO20, 

Bi12TiO20  and  Bi12GeO20)  have  interesting  properties  which  make  them  very  useful  for 

image processing and for optical metrology, particularly for holographic interferometry [8]. 

Despite their typically lower diffraction efficiency, they have a much shorter response time, 

which is very desirable for the field of non-destructive testing. Moreover, the limitation of 

low diffraction efficiency can be overcome through the anisotropic diffraction properties of 

these crystals, allowing the cut-off of the transmitted wave and enabling the readout of the 

weak diffracted wave [9]. The Bi12TiO20 (BTO) crystals have the aditional advantage of a 

relatively low optical activity for the red light, which allows the highest possible diffraction 

efficiency for this wavelength range [10]. It is well-known that diode red lasers are among 

the  most  compact,  available  and  low-cost  commercial  lasers,  which  permits  the 

construction  of  robust,  efficient,  low-cost,  BTO-based  holographic  interferometers.  Many 

works studied the holographic recording with photorefractive materials (including also the 

amorphous  polymers)  by  diode  lasers  [11-13].  However,  the  recording  and  imaging  with 

red diode lasers and BTO crystals has not been extensively studied so far.  

This work reports, for the first time to the author’s knowledge, the appearance of  

stable  interference  fringes  on holographic images  of  rigid,  non-vibrating objects  in  single 

exposure recordings. A red (λ=670 nm) diode laser is employed as the light source and a 

BTO  crystal  is  the  holographic  medium.  In  order  to  describe  this  effect  a  theoretical 

analysis based on the holographic recording of multiple volume holograms by a  multimode 

laser  in  a  sillenite  crystal  was  developed.  By  this  analysis,  one  can  show  that  the  fringes 

which  cover  the  holographic  image  are  the  contour  fringes  of  the  studied  object  surface. 

The  depth  difference  between  two  neighbouring  fringes  is  determined  by  the  wavelength 

interval  between  two  adjacent  laser  modes,  which,  in  its  turn,  is  related  to  the  laser  free 

spectral range (FSR). It is shown that the contour fringes in single-exposure recordings are 

only observed when short-cavity, multimode lasers are employed. 

 

1 Theoretical analysis  

Consider  two  coherent,  monochromatic  waves  of  wavelength  λ  interfering  in  an  

optically active sillenite photorefractive crystal (PRC), as shown in figure 1. The resulting 

interference pattern is responsible for a spatial rearrangement of charge carriers inside the 

crystal  by  diffusion  or  drift.  The  resulting  charge  redistribution  leads  to  a  spatially  non-

uniform electric field which in its turn produces a refractive index grating of amplitude ∆nr 

via  the  electrooptic  effect.  In  the  readout  process,  the  reconstructed  object  wavefront  is 

proportional to the hologram diffraction efficiency. If the sillenite crystal is cut in a [110] 

transverse electro-optic configuration, the diffraction efficiency η can be written as [14,15]

where n0 is the crystal refractive index, r41 is the electro-optic coefficient, 2α is the angle 

between the interfering beams, ρ is the optical activity and L is the crystal thickness. The 

electric  field  amplitude  Esc  generated  by  the  redistributed  space  charges  in  the  crystal  is 

dependent  on  the  modulation  index  m  of  the  interference  pattern.  In  a  purely  diffusion 

recording regime, this relation is given by [14]

where  R  and  S  are  the  amplitude  of  the  reference  and  the  signal  (or  object)  beams 

respectively, I0 is the total incident light intensity, and ED is the diffusion electric field. The 

superscript * denotes  the  complex  conjugation  of  the  wave  amplitude.  It  is  convenient  to 

express m in its complex form since this parameter carries the phase information about the 

interfering beams.  

In this study the reference and the object beams are originated from a multimode 

laser. Considering the oscillation of N modes, those beams can be expressed as

Each  mode  (i.e.,  each  wavelength)  will  contribute  for  the  recording  of  its 

respective  hologram  and  therefore  the  resulting  grating  will  be  a  superposition  of  all 

holograms. Since different modes are not mutually coherent, the phase difference 

n φφ −

(n≠ m) is likely to vary randomly in time. Thus, the interference of different modes does not 

contribute to the holographic recording and therefore it does not affect the process of fringe 

formation  on  the  holographic  image.  It  is  only  responsible  for  a  background  light  which 

lowers  the  grating  amplitude  ∆nr  and  consequently  decreases  the  overall  diffraction 

efficiency of the resulting grating. Hence, it is convenient to express the electric field from 

equation (2) through the following  matrix product:

In  the  readout  by  self-diffraction,  the  readout  beam  is  the  reference  one.  Such 

beam  of  intensity  IR  is  diffracted  by  the  hologram,  producing  the  holographic

the  reconstructed  object  image.  A  change  in  the  value  of 

RΓ   leads  to  a  phase  shift  and 

consequently the fringes run over the object surface, as it can be seen from figure 2. The 

analysis  of  such  interference  pattern  allows  the  profilometry  of  the  three-dimensional 

surface. According to equation (7), while the phase

,  where  l  is  the

holographic  imaging  of  standard-size  objects  does  not  allow  the  identification  of  contour 

fringes, since the free-spectral range of such lasers is much smaller than that of short-length 

(l ≅ 1 mm, typically) diode lasers.  

Figures 3a, 3b and 3c show the intensity of the diffracted wave with respectively 2, 

5 and 8 oscillating modes for

figure  2.  For  N  =  2  the  intensity  has  the  expected  cos2-type  profile,  as  in  a  conventional 

two-wavelength, double-exposure process. Notice that, the higher is the number of modes 

N, the narrower is the bright fringe. In fact, the width 

SΓδ of the bright fringe, defined as 

twice the ΓS difference from the fringe peak to the first zero, can be easily obtained with the 

help of  equation (7) :

2.1  Holographic  recording  with  plane  waves  –  In  order  to  verify  the  relation 

between the optical path of the interfering beams and the diffracted wave intensity given by 

equation (6), the holographic recording with plane waves was carried out. The optical setup 

is  depicted  in  figure  4.  The  reference  and  the  signal  beams  (R  and  S  in  figure  4, 

respectively) interfere at the BTO crystal after passing through the polarizer P1. Using the 

anisotropic  diffraction  properties  of  the  sillenite  crystals  and  considering  their  optical 

activity, if the input wave polarization is selected to be parallel to the [001] axis half-way 

through the crystal, the transmitted and the diffracted beams are orthogonally polarized at 

the crystal output. Thus, the transmitted reference wave is blocked by the polarizer P2 and 

only the diffracted signal beam is collected by the photodetector PD. The optical path of the 

signal beam is varied through the displacement of the 90o-prism PR, which is mounted on a 

micrometer. The reflection of the beam by the prism PR does not change the superposition 

of  the  interfering  beams  at  the  BTO  crystal  as  the  prism  is  displaced  throughout  the 

experiment. 

Figure  5  shows  the  intensity  of  the  diffracted  signal  beam  as  a  function  of  the 

prism position 

SΓ , with the value ΓR = 0 set arbitrarily. The dotted curve is the measured 

diffracted wave intensity, while the solid curve is the fitting of the experimental data with 

the intensity given by equation (6), for N = 4 laser modes and 

 18.1≈∆k

rd/mm

. With the 

help of equation (10) one can determine the wavelength interval ∆λ between adjacent laser 

modes to be 

.0=∆λ

nm 082

 (for λ=670 nm), and the FSR to be ≈ 53.4 GHz. 

2.2  Holographic  imaging  -  The  holographic  setup  for  the  imaging  of  three-

dimensional surfaces is shown in figure 6. The object is imaged onto the BTO crystal by 

the  lens  L2,  while  the  reconstructed  object  wave  is  collected  by  the  lens  L3  to  build  the 

holographic object image at the CCD camera. By properly adjusting the polarizers P1 and 

P2  as  described  in  the  previous  section,  only  the  holographic  image  is  displayed  in  a 

computer monitor for further processing. The mirror M3 is attached to a micrometer which 

introduces a phase shift in the reference beam. 

The holographic image of a 50-mm long flat metallic bar, 30o-tilted with respect to 

the front face of the crystal (see figure 6), was recorded. Figure 7a shows the holographic 

image  of  the  bar  covered  with  the  expected  vertical  and  parallel  contour  fringes,  while 

figure 7b shows the interferogram intensity profile along the line A-B from figure 7a. The 

x-axis  is  shown  in  figure  6.  Notice  that  the  appearance  of  narrow  fringes  in  the  intensity 

profile from figure 7b is in agreement with the results obtained in section 2.1, which show 

the oscillation of  4 laser modes. 

By  a  simple  measurement  of  the  distance  between  bright  (or  dark)  fringes,  the 

depth  difference  ∆d  along  the  y-axis  (see  fig.  6)  between  any  pair  of  points  laying  on 

adjacent  fringes  along  the  line  A-B  (or  lines  parallel  to  it)  was  determined  to  be 

mm 6.2≈∆d

. Considering that both the beam inciding on the object surface and the beam 

scattered

it

directions 

one 

gets

. Again from equation (10) one gets 

nm 08.0≈∆λ

, which is in 

good agreement with the result for ∆λ obtained in the previous section.  

As  discussed  in  section  1,  by  phase-shifting  the  reference  beam  a  three-

dimensional scanning of the object can be carried out as the contour fringes run along its 

surface. This phase shift was accomplished by displacing the mirror M3 with a micrometer 

along the direction shown in figure 6. Figures 8a, 8b and 8c show the contour fringes on the 

holographic image of a 40-mm diameter, metallic cylinder, for 

0=ΓR

, 

k∆π  and 

k∆π2

, 

respectively. The position of mirror M3 for the value ΓR = 0 was set arbitrarily. The change 

in the fringe position as the phase 

2RkΓ∆

 is varied can be clearly observed. As expected, a 

repetition  of  the  interferogram  occurred  as  the  mirror  M3  was  displaced  by  multiple 

integers of ~ 2.6 mm.  

3  Conclusions:  This  work  reports  the  formation  of  interference  fringes  on  the 

holographic image from rigid surfaces with Bi12TiO20 crystals when multimode, large FSR 

diode lasers are used as the light source. The theoretical analysis describes the recording of 

multiple  volume  gratings  in  the  BTO  crystal  and  obtains  the  diffraction  efficiency  of  the 

resulting hologram. 

Two  relevant  characteristics  of  the  holographic  imaging  where  shown  both 

theoretically and experimentally: first, the diffraction efficiency can have values from zero 

up to a maximum, depending on the difference between the optical paths of the reference 

and the object beams, so that the holographic image of the three-dimensional object appears 

covered  of  contour  fringes  in  a  single-exposure  holographic  process;  besides,  the  bright 

fringe  width  inversely  depends  on  the  number  of  the  oscillating  laser  modes.  The 

combination  of  these  two  properties  does  allow  a  very  sharp,  simple  and both qualitative 

and quantitative evaluation of the relief of three-dimensional surfaces. The employ of laser 

emitting with more than two modes results in contour fringes which are narrower than that 

obtained  in  two-wavelength  methods.  Thus,  the  narrower  the  fringes,  the  higher  the 

profilometry resolution. By phase-shifting the reference beam it is then possible to obtain a 

complete and accurate 3-D scanning of the object surface. 

The results of this work establish also the criterium for the geometry of the optical 

setup  in  the  case  of  holographic  recording  with  both  reference  and  signal  plane  waves. 

Since  the  diffraction  efficiency  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  phase  difference  of  both 

waves,  and  since  this  dependence  becomes  more  critical  as  more  modes  oscillate,  the 

optical path of the interfering beams must be carefully adjusted.

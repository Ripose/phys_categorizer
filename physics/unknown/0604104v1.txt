Abstract 
 
Correctness of the model representing the fullerene shell C60 as a conducting sphere 
has been analyzed. The static and dynamical polarizabilities of the molecule C60 have 
been  calculated  on  the  basis  of  experimental  data  on  the  photoabsorption  cross- 
section  of  fullerene.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  real  C60  in  the  static  electric  field 
behaves  most  likely  as  a  set  of  separate  carbon  atoms  rather  than  as  a  conducting 
sphere and its static polarizability exceeds by more than two times that of conducting 
sphere.  
 

1.The  aim  of  this  Letter  is  to  demonstrate  that  by  studying  photoeffect  from 
mesoscopic  objects  one  can  conclude  to  which  extent  they  are  a  “conductor”  or 
“dielectric”.  These  terms  characterize  the  ability  of  the  object  to  conduct  electricity 
and  are  applicable,  strictly  speaking,  only  to  macroscopic  bodies.  Therefore,  it  is 
meaningless  to  speak  about  conductivity  of  electrons  that  belong  to  such  a 
microscopic object as a single, even a multi-electron, atom. However, for mesoscopic 
objects  that include many  atoms the feature of conductivity  can become  meaningful 
starting  from  a  given  number  of  constituent  atoms.  This  makes  meaningful  the 
question whether mesoscopic system behaves as a conductor, i.e. whether its electrons 
can move freely under the action of an external electric field. 

Since  it  is  impossible  to  make  a  mesoscopic  system  an  element  of  a  normal 
electric circuit, other features characteristic of a conductor must be used to answer a 
question whether this system behaves like a conductor or not. As such, we use a quite 
natural  definition  that  a  static  external  electric  field  cannot  penetrate  inside  a 
conductiong  body.  As  an  object  of  investigation  and  as  a  concrete  example  of  a 
mesoscopic system we choose in this Letter the fullerene C60 molecule. The effective

C60.  Then  the  ratio 
  will  be  calculated  to  find  out  whether 
(
ωω
)0(η  is zero. It proved to be that this ratio is 
 and thus C60, contrary to the 
conclusion  in  Ref.  [1],  is  strongly  non-metallic.  It  is  demonstrated  that  it  cannot 
screen, but only enhances the external field inside C60. 
 
2.  The  experimental  studies  of  fullerene  interaction  with  electromagnetic 
radiation are evidence of a high degree of collectivization of the 2s2 and 2p2 electrons 
of the  carbon atoms forming a fullerene. This manifest itself, first of all, in existing 
the Giant Resonance in the cross section of the C60 fullerene photoabsorption that was 
discovered  and then investigated in a number of experimental studies [2, 3]. Virtual 
excitation of these electrons significantly influences the radiative and Auger - decay

processes taking place in so-called endohedral atoms A@C60, i.e. in the atoms located 
inside  the  fullerene  cage  [4,  5].  Plasmon  excitations  in  an  ensemble  of  delocalized 
electrons of C60 also influence radically the processes of photoabsorption of confined 
atoms [6]. 

In Ref. [1] it was considered to which extent the external electromagnetic field 
could reach the confined atom in A@C60. The aim was to find out the possibilities of 
photoelectron spectroscopy to study the confined atoms and determine the frequency 
windows, at which these atoms can be effectively excited. To do this, the collective 
behavior of the C60-electrons was used as a ground to replace the real fullerene cage 
by a spherical metallic container, at the center of which the ionized atom is located. 
Let us analyze whether such a model description of C60 screening of an encapsulated 
A  atom  is  realistic  and  whether  the  fullerene  shell  really  resembles  a  hollow  metal 
sphere. 
 
It  was shown in Ref. [1] by the methods of classical  electrodynamics  and in 
Refs.  [5,  6]  within  the  framework  of  quantum-mechanical  consideration  that  the 
photoionization cross section of endohedral atoms with taking into account the dipole 
collective  excitations  of  C60  electrons  is  a  product  of  two  dynamical  factors:  the 
photoionization cross section of the free A atom and the function 
 depending on 
photon energy. This function has the following form

The function Eq. (1) is connected with the ratio of the electric fields

 is the dynamical dipole polarizability of C60 fullerene and R is its radius. 
Here 
The reason  for such factorization of the photoionization cross  section  of  endohedral 
atoms is that the radius of the fullerene shell 
 significantly exceeds the radii 
of electronic shells of the encapsulated atom*/.  
 
the  fullerene  center  and  outside  the  C60  shell  by  the  relation 
known  that  the  static  polarizability  of  a  conducting  sphere  is 
  [7]. 
Therefore, in the model of fullerene shell Ref. [1] the function Eq. (1) goes to zero for 
F
. This is a reflection of the fact that 
the limit of zero frequencies of radiation: 
the  static  electric  field 
  does  not  penetrate  inside  the  conducting  sphere 
(“Maxwell  cage”)  and  for  this  reason  has  no  effect  on  the  atom  being  inside. 
Consequently, within the model of conducting fullerene shell the encapsulated atom is 
not polarized by the external static electric field. According to Ref [1], 
 is small 
enough also in a relatively broad frequency region. 
Generally speaking, there are no grounds to consider that the polarizability of 
 
the empty fullerene C60 and that of the same molecule but containing inside an atom 
A are equal. Hence the assumption that the fullerene shell in the electric field behaves 
as  a  conducting  sphere  should  be  justified.  The  difference  of  the  real  static 
3R  defines the degree of metallicity of the fullerene shell 
polarizability 
and,  consequently,  the  difference  between  the  polarizability  of  the  C60  and  A@C60 
molecules.

The  dynamical  polarizability  of  C60,  as  shown  in  Ref.  [8],  can  be  calculated 
 
from  the  experimental  data  on  the  photoabsorbtion  of  this  molecule  [2,  3].  Such  an 
approach,  unlike  the  method  in  Ref.  [1],  allows  avoiding  a  number  of  the  arbitrary 
assumptions inevitable for calculation of dynamic dipole polarizability of the metallic 
sphere  by  the  methods  of  classical  electrodynamics.  An  important  circumstance  to 
apply method [8] is that the photoionization cross-section of the fullerene C60, 
(ωσ , 
is characterized by a Giant Resonance with frequency 
. The calculation 
shows  that  the  oscillator  strengths  corresponding  to  the  electron  transition  to  the 
continuum  are  so  that  the  electron  transitions  to  the  discrete  spectrum  can  be 
neglected. This allows calculating the real part of the dynamic dipole polarizability of 
fullerene  with  the  help  of  the  dispersion  relation  keeping  in  them  just  the  integral 
corresponding to the transitions of optical electron to the continuum:

This  limit  transition  can  be  used  to  control  the  correctness  of  the  numerical  results 
obtained  with  integrals  (2)  and  (3).  The  calculation  of  the  integral  (4)  with  the 
(ωσ  performed in Refs. [2, 3] shows that the total number of 
experimental data for 
effN   that  take  part  in  forming  of  the  Giant  Resonance  in  photoionization 
electrons 
. This value differs only by ~ 4% from the number

of collectivized 2s2 and 2p2 electrons of the 60 carbon atoms, each giving 4 electrons 
forming a system of 240 collectivized electrons.

polarizability  of  the  fullerene  shell 
  are  depicted  in  Fig.1.  The  experimental 
(ωαd
)
photoabsorption cross-section for C60 taken from [3] is presented in the inset of this 
figure.  As  seen  from  this  figure,  the  cross  section  is  small  at  threshold  (which  also 
means the low intensity of discrete excitations) and has the form of a huge maximum 
- Giant Resonance - well above the threshold.

high  degree  of  2s2  and  2p2  electron  collectivization  manifesting  itself  as  the  Giant 
Resonance in the photoionization cross section 
(ωσ , the fullerene shell in the static 
electric  field  behaves  most  likely  as  a  set  of  separate  carbon  atoms  rather  than  as  a 
conducting sphere. The static electric field at the center of C60 is not equal to zero, but 
one and a half times stronger than the external electric field, contrary to what follows 
from the “metal sphere” model developed in Ref. [1]. The polarizability of the empty 
fullerene cage is incapable, as shown above, totally screen the external electric field 
and differs considerably from the polarizability of endohedral system A@C60.

It  is  remarkable  that  the  function

Abstract:    Incompatibility between the principle of the constancy of the speed of light and the Lorentz 

contraction  in  the  global  positioning  system  (GPS)  is  discussed.  The  GPS  works  precisely  in  the 

earth-centered locally inertial (ECI) coordinate system on the condition that the speed of light c is assumed 

to be constant regardless of the inertial motion of the GPS satellites and the earth. The inertial system of 

the  earth  travels  not  only  in  the  solar  system  at  the  velocity  30  km/s  but  also  in  the  cosmic  microwave 

background (CMB) at the velocity 700 km/s. The deviation on the car navigation system by the Lorentz 

contraction of 700 km/s is maximally estimated as 54 m. However, such a large deviation is not observed: 

that is, the Lorentz contraction is not observed in the gravitational field of the earth. If there is a Lorentz 

contraction, the GPS cannot work so precisely. The GPS satellites are in the gravitational field of the earth, 

therefore the system should be interpreted by the theory of general relativity as well as special relativity.

Introduction 

Ashby [1] described that the principle of the constancy of the speed of light, c, finds application as the 

fundamental  concept  on  which  the  GPS  is  based.  The  global  positioning  system  (GPS)  works  in  the 

earth-centered locally inertial (ECI) coordinate system. The atomic clocks in the GPS satellites show the 

effect of the theory of special and general relativity. A car navigation system works very precisely. As far 

as  the  assumption  that  “the  speed  of  light,  c,  is  constant”  is  concerned,  there  is  no  effect  neither  of  the 

velocity, vE=700 km/s, in the CMB, nor of the 30 km/s in the solar system. The assumption that the speed 

of light, c, is constant is completely proved in the GPS experiments [1]. 

At  the  same  time,  the  GPS  experiments  also  show  that  there  is  no  Lorentz  contraction.  That  is,  the 

assumption that the speed of light c constant is incompatible with the Lorentz contraction. If the Lorentz 

contraction  is  calculated  using  the  velocity  vE=700  km/s,  the  deviation  of  the  car  navigation  system  is 

maximally  estimated  as  54  m.  There  is  no  such  large  deviation  experimentally  detected.  Thus  we  can 

conclude that we should interpret that there is no Lorentz contraction in the GPS.

As mentioned in the previous report [2], I did not know the reason why the earth-centered earth-fixed 

(ECEF)  frame  or  the  ECI  coordinate  system  works  well.  I  considered  that  it  may  be  caused  by  the 

Lense-Thirring effect, which is an effect that is produced when the gravitational field of the earth pulls an 

inertial  system.  Thirring  predicted  that  a  rotating  massive  body  would  pull  the  surrounding  space-time. 

This effect was predicted in the early stages of general relativity, and was checked in an experiment done 

in recent years [3]. It seems that the gravitational field of the earth pulls the surrounding inertial system by 

an  effect  similar  to  the  Lense-Thirring  effect.  This  similar  effect  is  not  a  rotation  but  rather  a  linear 

dragging  of the inertial  system.  However,  there  is no discussion  of  an  inertial  frame  dragging. Figure  1 

illustrates the concept of an earth-centered local gravitational system which moves with the permittivity ε 

and  permeability  µ.  At  this  stage,  I  consider  that  either  the  ECEF  frame  or  the  ECI  coordinate  system 

works  correctly  under  the  consideration  of  the  theory  of  general  relativity  which  contains  the 

Lense-Thirring effect. 

  In this report, interpretation of the Lorentz contraction in the GPS experiment is discussed: that is, in a 

moving gravitational system, there is no Lorentz contraction detected. 

2. Interpretation of the speed of light in the GPS experiment 

The  inertial  system  is  constructed  by  the  GPS  satellites  and  the  earth.  Figure  1  shows  that  the  GPS 

satellites and the earth drift in the CMB at the velocity 700 km/s. The distance between the GPS satellites 

and a car on earth is measured using the signals from the GPS satellites. Figure 2 shows a coded signal 

which contains the information of the satellite’s position on the orbit and the precise time of the atomic 

clock in the satellite. If the signals are detected by a car on earth, the distance between the satellite and the 

car is calculated as

. Using the four satellites the position of the car on earth is 

identified [1]: the position is calculated precisely using the constant value of the speed of light c. Therefore 

the speed of light c is concluded to be constant regardless of the motion of the inertial system.   

In the GPS, atomic clocks in the GPS satellites can be treated by the ECI coordinate frame: the atomic 

clocks work accurately in the ECI coordinate frame, using the theories of special and general relativity [1].   

Figure  1  also  shows  a  new  assumption  that  the  local  gravitational  field  drags  the  surrounding 

space-time  (light  blue part)  of the  earth. It  is  similar  to  the  acoustic  waves  in the  atmosphere as  will  be 

discussed in section 3. Figure 1 illustrates that the isotropic constancy of the speed of light is caused by 

the theory of general relativity: that is the gravitational field drags the space-time. (At this stage, I have not 

carried out any theoretical considerations.)   

  The  GPS  satellites  travel  in  the  gravitational  field  at  the  velocity  of  4  km/s.  The  GPS  satellites  are 

traveling as if they are in the absolute stationary frame. The effects of the theory of special relativity cause 

a  7.1  µs  time  delay  every  day.  This  indicates  that  the  GPS  satellites  do  not  drag  the  permittivity  ε  and 

permeability µ. There is the gravitational effect which causes a 45.7 µs time gain every day compared with 

an atomic clock on earth.

3. Analogy of electromagnetic and acoustic waves 

In Maxwell’s equation, the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave, c, is described as   

.                                                                                                                                          (1)

Where ε=εrε0, µ=µrµ0, ε0 is the permittivity and µ0 is the permeability of free space, and εr is the relative 

permittivity  and  µr  is  the  relative  permeability.  If  the  permittivity,  ε,  and  permeability,  µ,  in  the  local 

gravitational  field  of  the  earth  move  with  the  earth,  the  speed  of  light,  c,  is  constant  regardless  of  the 

motion of the inertial system of the GPS satellites and the earth. It is very similar to the acoustic waves in 

the atmosphere. The phase velocity of acoustic waves is described as 

,                                                                                                                                              (2) 

where  C  is  the  coefficient  of  stiffness  and  ρ is  the  density.  C  and  ρ move  with  the  earth  because  C  and 

ρ are characteristic of the atmosphere which moves with the earth. The sound source, for example a car 

horn, does not move with the atmosphere.   

There is an analogy between electromagnetic and acoustic waves in that the phase velocity is defined by 

the coefficients. Acoustic waves in the atmosphere travel at the sound velocity of 340 m/s independent of 

the motion of earth in the solar system. Electromagnetic waves in the gravitational field of the earth are 

similar to acoustic waves in the atmosphere.

GPS satellites are similar to a car horn on the moving car: that is, the air around the car does not move 

with the car. While this is a very simple and rough illustration, it is, however, intuitive. 

4. Deviation on the car navigation system by the Lorentz contraction

stationary  state.)  The  distance  between  the  GPS  satellite  and  the  car  is  around  20,000  km.  Thus  the 

deviation on the car navigation system by the Lorentz contraction is maximally estimated as,

In the solar system, where vE=30 km/s in equation (4), the deviation is only 100 mm. Table 2 shows the 

deviation on the car navigation system calculated from the Lorentz contraction. In the interferometer of L1 

band (1575.42 MHz, wavelength: 190 mm), relative accuracies of millimeters are reported [1]. This is the 

precise positioning analysis with carrier-phase measurements.   

If, assuming that the CMB is the absolute reference frame, there is no deviation on the car navigation 

system, we can conclude that there is no Lorentz contraction. If the gravitational field of the earth pulls an 

inertial  system,  the  ECI  coordinate  system  works.  As  discussed  previously,  it  is  similar  to  sound 

propagation in the atmosphere on earth. 

5. Discussion 

5.1 The constancy of the speed of light 

    This report starts from the simple question of why the speed of light, c, has isotropic constancy in the 

GPS. The earth moves in the universe, therefore the Lorentz contraction is expected. However, the GPS 

experiment  shows  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  the  Lorentz  contraction.  The  earth  seems  to  be  in  the 

absolute stationary state.

    To solve this problem, using the analogy of acoustic waves, gravitational fields of the earth moves with 

the permittivity, ε, and permeability, µ. The relative permittivity, εr, seems to move with the earth, however, 

I do not have any idea of the motion of the permittivity, ε0 , and permeability, µ0. According to the GPS 

experimental data, the illustration in Fig. 1 is acceptable. This assumption of motion of the permittivity, ε, 

and  permeability,  µ,  with  the  earth  makes  the  reference  time  of  the  earth  be  coincident  with  that  of  the 

absolute  stationary  state after  excluding the  gravitational  effect  of  the  earth. A  clock  in  the  gravitational 

field of the earth is not affected by the drift motion in the CMB. 

The Michelson-Morley experimental results are easily explained. This is because the gravitational local 

fields are equivalent to the absolute stationary state: that is, the two light paths of the Michelson-Morley 

experiment are completely equivalent. Thus the motion of the earth cannot be detected. The illustration in 

Fig 1 is intuitive.   

5.2 The frame dragging effect 

The ECI coordinate system appears to work only in the gravitational field but not in free space. In this 

report, the gravitational field is assumed to drag the space-time around the earth. The dragging of space 

indicates that the permittivity, ε, and permeability, µ, move with the gravitational field. The dragging of 

the  relative  permittivity,  εr,  and  permeability,  µ  r,  can  be  interpreted  using  the  analogy  of  the  acoustic 

waves in the atmosphere. This is because the relative permittivity, εr, and permeability, µ r, adhere to the 
atmosphere.       

At this stage, the frame dragging is discussed in rotating or accelerated motions: there is no discussion 

of an inertial frame dragging. Although I have no idea of the dragging of ε0 and µ0, however, the inertial 

frame dragging with the gravitational field is reasonable.   

The  dragging  of  time  indicates  that  the  reference  time  is  not  affected  by  the  velocity  vE:  that  is  the 

reference time does not need to consider the drift motion of the inertial frame. Only the gravitational field 

affects the reference time. That is time dilation by gravity. 

6. Conclusion 

The GPS, which constructs the local gravitational system, is considered in the absolute stationary state. 

The isotropic constancy of the speed of light, c, is sustained. There is no Lorentz contraction detected.   

The GPS precisely works in the ECI coordinate system. If only the theory of special relativity is applied 

to  the  interpretation  of  the  GPS  experiment,  the  deviation  on  the  car  navigation  system  by  the  Lorentz 

contraction of 700 km/s in the CMB is maximally estimated as 54 m. However, there is no such deviation. 

The  gravitational  field  drags  the  relative  permittivity,  εr,  and  permeability,  µr,  around  the  earth. 

Furthermore,  the  theory  of  general  relativity  should  be  taken  into  consideration.  The  GPS  should  be 

interpreted by the theory of general relativity as well as special relativity.

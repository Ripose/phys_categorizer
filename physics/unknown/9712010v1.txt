A remark on the movement of a point mass particle is given. If one associates to

the particle a sphere of radius equal to the related De Broglie length, the relativistic

action on the trajectory is proportional to the surface described by this sphere.

1. Introduction

In standard relativistic mechanics, the base space-time is considered to be the Minkowski

ﬂat space, i.e. a real 4-dimensional manifold endowed with the Lorentzian metric ηik

A common procedure to derive the general properties of the movement is the use of the

principle of least action. For a point particle of rest mass m0, the action S may be written1:

S = −m0c

(ηikdxidxk)1/2 ≡ −m0c

as being proportional to the length Lif of the world line of the point particle in the Minkowski

space between some initial i and ﬁnal f points; ds is the element of length of the world line,

c is the speed of light and v is the speed of the particle.

In string theories, the particle

becomes a 1-dimensional object. The simplest type of action is the Nambu-Goto one2:

S = T

˙X 2X ′2 − ( ˙X · X ′)2

which is proportional to the area Σif of the world sheet of the string embedded in the

Minkowski space; dΣ is the element of area of the world sheet and T is a constant of

proportionality introduced in order make the expression of the dimensions of action. No

more details are needed for the further understanding of the paper. If necessary, see2.

The conclusions of this part is that the dynamic properties of the movement of the

particles may be described by means of an action which is proportional to geometrical

objects attached to the Minkowski space-time description (the length for the point particle

and the area for the string). These concepts does not change in fact when passing from

classical to quantum mechanics.

2. Surface proportional action for a point particle

We shall study the movement of a point particle of mass m . In the wave quantum mechanics,

one may associate to this particle the De Broglie characteristic length ΛB

3:

ΛB =

h
2πp

=

h
2πmv

where h is the Planck action constant, p - the momentum, m - the mass and v the velocity

of the particle in some inertial frame (let’s say the laboratory frame).

From the quantum mechanical point of view, we may consider in a good approximation

that the particle is conﬁned in a spatial zone delimited by a sphere whose radius is just

the De Broglie length ΛB. In this approximation, we are allowed to introduce a sphere of

radius ΛB attached to the particle. If the particle moves onto the direction x, this sphere

determines an axis symmetric surface around the x axis in the laboratory frame. The area

of this surface between the positions xi and xf is, obviously:

Aif = 2π

ΛB · dx = 2π

By replacing dx = v · dt and taking into account the relativistic mass dependence on speed1,

where m0 is the rest mass of the particle and c - the speed of light.

On the other side, the relativistic action 1 for the same point mass particle is:

3. Conclusions

There are two general distinct methods to describe a particle: point particle or string.

The dynamics of a point particle is described by a world line length proportional action,

meanwhile the string action is proportional to the area of the world sheet. Starting from

basic quantum mechanical assumptions, we considered that a point particle is conﬁned in

the interior of a sphere of radius equal to the attached De Broglie wavelength. After simple

calculations, we proved that the area of the spatial surface described by this sphere attached

to the particle is proportional to the standard relativistic action. This toy model could

establish an intuitive argument for the progress of peace in the particles vs. strings war.

Abstract

The  picosecond  geminate  recombination  kinetics  for  hydrated  electrons  generated  by

200  nm  two  photon  absorption  (12.4  eV  total  energy)  has  been  measured  in  both  light  and

heavy water. The geminate kinetics are observed to be almost identical in both H2O and D2O.

Kinetic  analysis  based  upon  the  independent  reaction  time  approximation  indicates  that  the

average separation between the electron and its geminate partners in D2O is 13% narrower than

in  H2O  (2.1  nm  vs.  2.4  nm).  These  observations  suggest  that,  even  at  this  high  ionization

energy, autoionization of water competes with direct ionization.

1. Introduction.

Although  recombination  dynamics  of  photoelectrons  in  liquid  water  have  been

extensively  studied  (e.g.,  refs.  [1-8]),  many  questions  concerning  the  mechanism  of

generation, localization, and solvation of these electrons still remain unanswered. It is

presently accepted that the time profile of geminate recombination kinetics for hydrated

electrons generated by multiphoton laser ionization of liquid water, reaction (1),

depends on the total photoexcitation energy  Etot . [1-5] Two- or three-photon excitation of

water  at  lower  photon  energy  (so  that  Etot   <  9.2  eV)  produces  electrons  that  are,  on

average, just 0.9-1 nm away from their parent hole, [1-6] whereas at higher total photon

energy ( Etot  > 11 eV), the photoelectrons are ejected at least 2 nm away. [1,2,3,7,8] It is

believed that in this high-energy regime, the electrons might be ejected directly into the

conduction  band  of  the  solvent,  [1,3]  as  the  conduction  band  of  water  is  commonly

placed  between  9  and  10  eV  above  the  ground  state.  [9,10]  At  lower  energy,  the

photoionization involves concerted proton and electron transfers, [9-12] perhaps to pre-

existing traps. [13,14] In the intermediate regime, autoionization of water is thought to

compete with these two photoprocesses. [3]

In this work we present picosecond geminate recombination kinetics for electrons

in light and heavy water obtained using a total excitation energy of 12.4 eV, which is well

above the accepted band gap of liquid water. The 12.4 eV excitation energy was attained

via  two  photon  absorption  using  a  subpicoseond  6.2  eV  (200  nm)  light  source.  Under

these photoexcitation conditions, direct ionization of the solvent (by which we mean the

ejection of photoelectron directly into the conduction band of the liquid) has been thought

to  prevail.  [3]  Due  to  the  smaller  vibration  energy  of  accepting  O-D  modes  in  heavy

water, and, therefore, less efficient inelastic scattering of the extended-state (quasifree)

electron, it has been expected that the thermalization of the conduction band electrons in

D2O (generated by direct photoionization of the solvent) would be less efficient, and the

average thermalization path in D2O would be longer than in H2O. [3,15] Pulse radiolysis

2.

studies  have  shown  that  at  high  excitation  energy  the  distribution  of  thermalization

distances is broad (2-3 nm width in light water) and it is indeed ca. 30% broader for

heavy  water.  [15]  However,  this  result  does  not  indicate  under  what  conditions  it

becomes  possible  to  produce  such  electron  distributions  in  the  course  of  photo-

ionization. The required energy might be so high that more than one electron is generated

per excitation event (the average energy needed for water ionization in radiolytic spurs is

20-25  eV  [15]).  Still,  it  is  generally  believed  that  for  higher  excitation  energy,  the

electron distributions generated via photoionization of water would more closely follow

the electron distributions obtained via radiolysis. As shown below, for the case of 12.4

eV photoionization these expectations are not supported by our observations, indicating

that  even  higher  excitation  energies  are  needed  to  observe  the  same  results  as  those

obtained by pulse radiolysis. Whereas above-the-gap excitation of water produces broad

electron  distributions  that  are  similar  to  those  observed  in  radiolytic  spurs,  the

distribution is, actually, narrower for heavy water.

2. Experimental.

Deionized water with conductivity < 2 nS/cm was used in all experiments with

H2O.  An N2-saturated 1 L sample was circulated using a gear pump through a jet nozzle.

A 500 mL sample of heavy water (99 atom %, Aldrich) was used in all experiments with

D2O. No change in the kinetics was observed after continuous photolysis of this sample.

The details of the flow system are given elsewhere. [16]

The picosecond transient absorption (TA) measurements were carried out using a

1  kHz  Ti:sapphire  setup,  details  of  which  are  given  in  refs.  [16,17,18].  This  setup

provided 60 fs FWHM, 3 mJ light pulses centered at 800 nm. One part of the beam was

used  to  generate  probe  pulses  while  the  other  part  was  used  to  generate  the  200  nm
(fourth harmonic) pump pulses. Up to 20 µJ of the 200 nm light was produced in this way

(300-350 fs FWHM pulse). The pump and probe beams were perpendicularly polarized

and overlapped at the surface of a 90 µm thick high-speed water jet at 5

. No change of

o

the TA kinetics with the polarization of the probe light was observed. The pump power,

before  and  after  the  sample,  was  monitored  using  a  thermopile  power  meter.  The  TA
traces were obtained using a 1-5 µJ, 200 nm pump pulse focused, using a thin MgF2 lens,

3.

to  a  round  spot  of  300  µm  FWHM;  the  probe  beam  was  typically  50-60 µm FWHM.
Radial  profiles  of  these  beams  at  the  jet  surface  were  obtained  by  scanning  a  10  µm
pinhole across the beam. A typical TA signal ( ∆ODλ, where λ is the wavelength of the

probe light in nanometers) at the maximum was 10-to-60 mOD. The vertical bars in the

figures represent 95% confidence limits for each data point. 150-200 delay time points

acquired  on  a  quasi-logarithmic  grid  were  used  to  obtain  the  decay  kinetics  of  the

electron out to 500 ps.

3. Results.

Fig.  1(a)  shows  the  200  nm  pulse  energy  dependence  for  the  normalized  TA
( ) obtained at the delay time t=10 ps (this dependence is given on a double

signal  ∆OD t

logarithmic plot). At this delay time, the thermalization is complete [19] (in accord with

the  previous  observations  for  photoionization  at  lower  excitation  energies,  see  refs.

of this plot (solid line in Fig. 1(a)) is close to 1.84±0.07, indicating biphotonic ionization

of  water  by  the  200  nm  light.  At  high  power,  this  slope  decreases  to  1-1.5  due  to

nonuniform  absorbance  of  the  200  nm  light  by  the  sample.  [23]  When

recombination that occurs between two different ionization events) in the sample bulk

(compare traces (i) and (ii) in Fig. 1(b)). [22,23] These TA kinetics are power-dependent

and their time profiles are different from the profile of geminate recombination kinetics

obtained  in  the  low-power  regime.  In  the  latter  regime,  normalized  TA  kinetics  are

independent of the 200 nm pulse energy. Only the pump power independent kinetics are
−  produced in the experiment

considered in the rest of this paper. The concentration of  eaq

was on the order of 10-5 mol/dm3.

(for λ=0.8 µm) are shown in Fig. 2. Very similar kinetics for t>5 ps were observed at

shown in Fig. 2 suggests these two traces are identical within the confidence limits of our

measurement.  Note  that  the  origin  of  the  vertical  axis  corresponds  to  85%  survival

(where  X  =  H  or  D)  for  light  and  heavy  water  are  different  (Table  1),  different

recombination kinetics are expected to be observed in H2O and D2O for the same initial
distribution  P r( ).  Conversely,  identical  recombination  kinetics  imply  different  initial
distributions  P r( ). Fitting the kinetics by the IRT model equations (see refs. [1,2,24] and

σ

G =2.4 nm for H2O and σ

water is  narrower than in the light water. While the quality of these kinetic traces does

Sander  et  al.  [3]    suggested  that  the  switchover  from  positive  to  negative  α

  with

H D/

increasing  energy  (which  is  observed  between  9.5  and  10  eV)  reflects  a  competition

between the photoinduced electron transfer to a pre-existing trap (that prevails for  Etot  <

9.5 eV) and autoionization of water (that prevails for  Etot  > 9.5 eV). The latter is initiated

by a bound-to-bound transition to a short-lived excited state; this excited state promptly

dissociates yielding a conduction band electron. Sander et al. [3] predicted the second
change  of  the  sign  of  α

H D,  from  negative  to  positive,  when  Etot   >  11  eV  and  direct

ionization (which involves a bound-to-free transition) prevails.

At first glance, our 12.4 eV data lend support to the suggestions made by Sander
≈ 0 (in agreement with the predicted second switchover) and the widths

et al. [3]:  α

H D/

σ

G   compare  well  with  those  in  the  radiolytic  spurs  (suggesting  the  onset  of  direct

photoionization). On the other hand, even at this high excitation energy the distribution of

electrons  in  D2O  is  13%  narrower  than  in  H2O;  this  difference  is  comparable  to  15%

obtained by Sander et al. for 10 eV photoexcitation [3] (where autoionization is supposed

to prevail). The results presented here do no support the idea that the energy at which the

thermalization distance becomes greater in D2O than in H2O occurs at ca. 11 eV, in fact it

does  not  even  occur  at  12.4  eV.  The  turn  over  in  the  isotope  effect  is  believed  to  be

evidence for the conversion of the ionization mechanism from autoionization to primarily

direct ionization. Either direct ionization is not dominant at 12.4 eV or it does not result

in  a  longer  thermalization  path  for  D2O.  Both  of  these  possibilities  hint  at  a  complex

picture of water ionization at high excitation energy.

There  have  been  other  results  suggesting  such  a  complexity.  Synchrotron

radiation  studies  of  Brocklehurst  [25]  reveal  that  that  the  delayed  luminescence  from

recombination  of  geminate  ion  pairs  generated  by  vacuum  UV  photoexcitation  of  a

viscous hydrocarbon squalane continuously change between 10 and 25 eV, well above

6.

the  gap  energy  of  this  liquid  (8-9  eV).  The  observed  change  in  the  recombination

dynamics  indicates  continuous  broadening  of  the  electron  distribution  with  increasing

energy.  No  such  broadening  is  observed  for  UV  and  vacuum  UV  photoionization  of

aromatic solutes in liquid alkanes; the width of the distribution stabilizes at 3 eV above

the  ionization  threshold.  [25]  These  results  suggest  that  in  squalane,  direct  ionization

competes  with  some  other  photoionization  mechanism,  even  at  these  high  photon

energies. [12,25,26] The magnetic field effect data of Brocklehurst [25] and Jung and

coworkers [26] provide evidence for the existence of an ionization channel through which

the singlet correlation between the radical ions in the geminate pair is rapidly lost; spin-

orbit  interaction  in  the  excited  bound  state  of  the  solvent  (which  mediates  the

autoionization) has been suggested as such a channel. [25] This loss of spin correlation is

quite  notable  between  11  and  16  eV,  at  the  very  onset  of  the  direct  ionization.  [25]

Perhaps, the distinction between direct ionization and autoionization is not as clear-cut as

suggested by Sander et al.: [3] both photoprocess compete well above the postulated 11

eV threshold.

5. Conclusion.

The  geminate  recombination  kinetics  for  hydrated  electrons  generated  by

absorption of two 200 nm quanta (12.4 eV total energy) by light and heavy water are

similar. Kinetic analyses within the framework of the IRT model [24] suggest that the

initial distribution of distances between the electron and its geminate partners in D2O is

narrower than in H2O. Since the opposite trend is expected in the regime where direct

ionization  prevails,  it  appears  that  autoionization  of  water  still  competes  with  direct

ionization  at  this  high  excitation  energy.  The  latter  ionization  mechanism  has  been

thought to prevail when the total excitation energy is greater than 11 eV. [1,3,5,20] While

our  result  is  unexpected,  it  is  consistent  with  the  previous  observations  of  competing

ionization channels in the vacuum UV photoexcitation of molecular liquids. [25,26]

at 25 oC (observed at t=10 ps after the photoionization) as a function of the power of the

200  nm  pulse  (open  circles).  For  this  measurement,  the  pump  and  probe  beams  were

tightly  focussed.  Note  the  double  logarithmic  scale.  The  initial  slope  of  1.84±0.07  is

consistent  with  biphotonic  ionization  of  water  by  200  nm  light.  (b)  Normalized  TA

kinetics  at  the  extremes  of  the  dynamic  range  are  shown  in  (a).  The  traces  were

normalized at t=5 ps. Trace (i) (open squares) was obtained for the highest pump power;

trace (ii) (open circles) was obtained for the lowest pump power in (a). The solid lines are

guides to the eye. The vertical bars are 95% confidence limits. Note the logarithmic time

scale and non-zero origin of the vertical axis. The rapid decay on the subnanosecond time

scale is due to the cross-recombination in the water bulk.

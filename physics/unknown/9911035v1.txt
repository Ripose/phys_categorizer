Abstract

We present a theoretical study of strong laser-atom interactions, when the laser field

parameters are subjected to random processes. The atom is modelled by a two–level and

three–level systems, while the statistical fluctuations of the laser field are described by a

pre-Gaussian model. The interaction of the laser–target is treated nonperturbatively by

using the calculation method based on the hermitian Floquet theory. Our aim consists in

studying the kinetic of atomic relaxation induced by a laser noise. In the resonant case

and  electric  field  strengths  small  with  respect  to  the  atomic  unit  electric  strength,  the

present nonperturbative results are in agreement with those obtained within the rotating

wave approximation of Eberly et al. and Wodkiewicz et al., for an atom modelled by a

two–level  system.  We  discuss  some  examples  which  demonstrate  the  destruction  of

atomic  coherence  by  the  noise,  the  regime  of  relaxation  to  equilibrium  state  and  the

optical  analogue  of  motional  narrowing.  We  also  give  new  results  for  two–level  and

three–level systems, and for a strong laser field at exact resonance, in the case of phase,

amplitude  noises.  The  case  of  fluctuation  due  to  collisions  is  also  discussed.  Our

numerical results indicate that ionisation effects, in the presence of laser noise, can lead

to  important  modifications  of  the  populations  for  strong  laser–atom  interactions.  The

changes generated onto the ionisation rates by the noise are also investigated.

1. Introduction

It  is  actually  recognised  that  nearly  all  types  of  laser–atom  interactions  can  be

strongly affected by laser noise. In fact, real atoms experience a fluctuating environment

of many perturbing interactions and ideal lasers exist only in theoretical models, while

the  used  laser  sources  are  subjected  to  many  types  of  fluctuations  notably  in  phase,

amplitude and frequency. Stochastic variations of the Hamiltonian can be due not only

to the  field but  also to the jump–type transitions of the atom from one energy state to

another,  jumps  which  are  characteristic  of  condensed  phases  and  which  modulate  its

interaction  with  the  medium  [1].  Therefore,  we  cannot  realise,  without  taking  into

account  the  statistical  properties  of  the  laser  radiation,  an  exact  comparison  between

theoretical  predictions  and  experimental  results.  Incorporation  of  such  stochastic

properties  into  the  Liouville  equation  by  fully  microscopic  treatment  (relaxation  times

and bandwidths) [2]  give  modest  results,  so  we  use  a  theoretical  models  based  on  the

Markov  pre–Gaussian  processes  [2–5].  These  processes,  composed  of  N–independent

two–state jump processes (random telegraphs), form a non–Gaussian stochastic models,

also  called  Markov  chains.  Such  a  Markov  chain  offers  a  detailed  discussion  of  the

atomic  response.  Our  choice  of  the  Markov  chain  is  based  on  the  simplicity  of  this

model  and  the  remarkable  property  of  convergence  to  a  Gaussian  stochastic  process

when N ﬁ

. We derive the proper master equation for the density operator driven by

a noise described by two–state stochastic telegraph process. This fundamental equation

first  introduced  in  quantum  optic  by  Burshtein  [2–4],  contains  all  information

concerning  both  the  atomic  transitions  dynamic  and  the  stochastic  evolution  of  laser

field fluctuations.

Several works have reported on the action of random process on a two–level system

[1-4,6,7],  particularly  the  evolution  populations.  In  the  present  article  we  want  to

investigate  the  atomic  response  to  a  noise  laser,  i.e.,  to  describe  the  relaxation  of  the

atomic level populations r nn. It should be noted that the kinetic of the phase relaxation

contains  information  on  the  width  and  shape  of  the  spectral  lines  [1].  We  also  extend

our  study  to  a  three–level  system  and  we  provide  the  ionisation  influence  for  strong

3

laser–atom  interactions,  when  the  laser  field  parameters  are  subjected  to  random

process.

We  are  concerned  here  with  an  important  theme  of  contemporary  research,  namely

the  interplay  between  quantum  coherence  and  external  noise.  The  destruction  of

quantum coherence by noise is central to many fields of physics and is reflected in the

large number of papers recently published on this subject [8-12].

In  this  paper  we  are  interested  by  a  strong  laser  field  whose  frequency  is  resonant;

time  dependent  perturbation  theory  and  rotating  wave  approximation  (RWA)  [13]  are

therefore  not  adequate  to  resolve  the  interaction  process.  Indeed,  the  perturbation

method  is  justified  when  the  electric  field  strength  F0  remains  much  smaller  than  the
atomic  unit  of  field  strength,  namely  F0  <<  5.109  V  cm-1  and  when  the  laser  photon
energy  is  not  tuned  close  to  an  atomic  transition  energy.  The  second  limitation  is

resolved by the RWA, however there is the Bloch–Sierget shift [13] which deteriorates

the  efficiency  of  this  approximation,  especially  when  the  laser  intensity  increases.  We

explore  the  limits  of  validity  of  rotating  wave  approximation  for  multi-level  system

and/or for strong laser field. We have therefore developed a nonperturbative treatment

of 

the 

laser–atom 

interactions,  based  on 

the  Floquet 

theory  [14-18].  This

nonperturbative  method  allows 

to 

transform 

the 

time  dependent  Liouville  or

Schrödinger  equation  to  a  stationary  problem  of  eigenvalues.  This  problem  can  be

solved without restrictions on the  laser  parameters,  i.e.,  its  solution  requires  at  most  a

finite matrix diagonalization. It is another advantage of Floquet method in the context of

laser–atom interactions.

The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we present a detailed description of

the theoretical formalism, which is valid for the general case of multi-level atoms. By

considering the case of noise strong laser–atom interactions, for which detailed Floquet

calculations are feasible to obtain the density matrix elements, which are solutions of the

master  equation.  The  account  of  Floquet  theory  given  here  is  rather  brief,  since  the

theory  has  been  discussed  at  length  in  the  recent  literature  (see  e.  g.  refs.  [14–18]).

Numerical  results  concerning  the  model  of  two–level  and  three–level  systems  are

presented  and  discussed  in  section  3,  where  the  phase  and  amplitude  noises  are

described  by  random  telegraph  and  Markov  chain.  The  case  of  fluctuations  due  to

4

collisions is analysed. We also discuss the noise effect on the ionisation process. At the

end a summary of our results is given.

2. General formalism

We  consider  a  model  of  multi–level  atom  excited  by  a  classical  purely

monochromatic laser field described by an electric field linearly polarised,

F0 (t) = F0 cos(w

t + f (t)).

(1)

Here F0 is the electric field amplitude (possibly fluctuating in magnitude) and f (t) is the

instantaneous  phase  of  the  laser  (  fluctuating  around  the  zero  value  ).  The  laser

parameters  are  affected  by  a  stochastic  process  of  jumps.  We  represent  these

fluctuations  by  a  Markovian  Pre–Gaussian  models.  Thereafter,  we  denote  the  random

telegraph  and  the  Markov  chain  respectively  [3];  by  the  processes  [  x(t)  =  – a  ]  and

[ X(t) = {– Na, –(N-2)a, ..., (N-2)a, and Na}], with a is the amount of the jump assigned

to the stochastic signal and N the number of random telegraph signals [3].

In  order  to  incorporate  a  laser  phase  or  amplitude  noise  in  equations,  treating  the

laser–atom  interactions,  we  have  therefore  describe  the  system  states  considered  in

terms  of  the  density  matrix  elements.  The  time  dependent  behaviour  of  the  density

operator r

 is given by the Liouville equation [18]

(s and s’ = 1,2), corresponding to the telegraph signal amplitude (– a). T denote the dwell

time (i.e., the mean time between interruptions) for the telegraph.

The  main  difficulty  of  typical  problems  lies  in  the  correct  averaging  of  the  matrix

density  over  all  realisations  of  noise.  In  fact,  what  is  wanted  is 

,  that  is,  the

nn'

solution  to  the  equation  (6)  averaged  over  the  ensemble  of  jumps  of  the  implicit

telegraph  x(t).  To  obtain 

  one  proceeds  indirectly,  defining  a  marginal  average

average  value  of  r nn’(t)  under  the  condition  that  x(t)  is  fixed  at  the  value  s  at  time  t.

Combining the Chapman–Kolmogorov equation (9) for the probability density function

and the dynamic equation (6) for the statistical operator r (t), a master equation can be

derived for the so–called marginal averages r nn’,s (t) [2,3]. It reads

(expression  (13))  is  truncated  to  a  finite  Mmax  number  of  terms  which  permits  the

convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of G. In the absence of noise, the density

operator satisfies a 9· 9 matrix differential equation with constant coefficients ( case of

three–level  system  ). The master equation allows  stochastic  telegraph  type  noise  to  be

added at the sole expense to enlarge the matrix dimensionality from 9· 9 to 9ns· 9ns; ns

3. Results and discussion

By describing external sources of noise by Pre–Gaussian Markov chains composed of

N–independent jump processes, we treated two different sources of pre–Gaussian noise

(phase and amplitude) by using a simple general master equation soluble in finite terms.

Our  application  is  carried  out  in  two  cases.  In  first,  the  model  of  two–level  atom  on

resonance is considered and it results compared with those obtained by Eberly et al. and

Wodkiewicz et al. [2,3]. We also provide some results for atomic response, when RWA

approximation is not justified for strong laser fields. In second, the behaviour of three–

level atom response to laser noisy is investigated. We choose the inverse Rabi frequency

 as time unit, (where W

 = dnk.F0, with d nk is the dipole matrix element between levels

|næ  and |kæ ), in the aim to analyse the obtained results in terms of the noise strength .

In the absence of any noise source ( electric laser field is purely coherent) and if we

neglect the other relaxation rates ( spontaneous decay and ionisation rate), the behaviour

of the populations of two-level and three–level systems is illustrated in Figure 1., which

shows a superposition of several undamped oscillation modes ( Rabi oscillations). The

system remains indefinitely in this oscillatory state.

3. 1. Two–level atom in presence of random telegraph laser noise.

As  already  noted  by  several  authors  [2–4],  the  behaviour  of  a  two–level  atom  to

pre–Gaussian  noise  in  strong  laser–atom  interactions  depends  critically  on  a  special

telegraph  noise.  The  agreement  between  the  two  methods  (the  numerical  calculation

within the framework of  rotating  wave  approximation  and  the  present  nonperturbative

method  of  calculation  based  on  the  Floquet  theory)  is  good  at  resonant  excitation  and

when the electric field strength F0 remains much smaller  than  the  atomic  unit  of  field
strength 5. 109  V/cm. This  behaviour is illustrated in Figure 2.(A), where we  show  an

example  of  phase  random 

telegraph 

influence  on  atomic 

level  populations

corresponding to the phase jumps a = 0.4p

, the electric field strength F0 = 106 V/cm for
the phase switching rates (W T = 0.1, 1 and 10). Figure 2.(B) displays the atomic level

populations  resonantly  excited  by  random  telegraph  phase  noise,  corresponding  to  the

11

W
phase  jumps  a  =  0.4p

,  the  electric  field  strength  F0  =  5.  108  V/cm  and  from  phase

fluctuations for three different rates switching. The regime of weak damping is observed

for (W T = 10). The atomic populations exhibit a motional narrowing regime for small

Rabi frequency compared to the frequency noise (W T = 0.1), in this case, the telegraph

jumps are too fast that the atomic system can feel only the mean value of fluctuations.

For (W T = 1), we note a partial destruction of the atomic coherence by the phase noise

and the kinetic of relaxation is rapid (strong damping). The two populations converge to

a  steady-state  of  value  1/2,  in  indication  that  the  phase  jump  relaxation  is  purely

‘‘transverse’’[2]. It is interesting to note the presence of an irregular  behaviour  on  the

oscillations  of  the  two  populations  for  a  strong  laser  field;  in  fact,  we  observe  small

oscillations which come to superpose to the Rabi oscillations, their amplitude is  weak

and  disappears  when  the  electric  field  strength  F0  becomes  small  with  respect  to  the

atomic unit of field strength. These little oscillations represent the fast variable phases
–   i  (w +w nn’)t
e

  which  are  safely  neglected  by  the  authors  [2–4],  by  using  the  rotating

wave  approximation.  Figure  3  shows  an  example  of  amplitude  telegraph  influence  on

atomic level populations. Taking a = 0.1, three different amplitude switching rates (W T

= 0.1,1,100) and the electric field strength is F0 = 5. 108 V/cm. We remark a very weak
damping  at  (W T  =  0.1,1)  and  a  beats  phenomena  at  (W T  =  100).  In  order  to  lead  the

system to the relaxation process, we must use a large number of Rabi periods than in the

case of phase fluctuations. The main difference observed between the random telegraph

phase  and  amplitude  modulation  arises  from  the  choice  of  the  laser  stochastic

fluctuations.

frequency 

As  already  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  under  collision  effects,  the  transition
w 21  can  also  fluctuates  around  its  fixed  value  w 21.  The  simplest  model  of
such  interruption  collisions  [4,21]  assumes  that  the  atomic  transition  frequency  w 21
should  be  replaced  by  w 21  (t)  =  w 21  +  x(t).  Figure  4  displays  ,  the  influence  of  such

collisional noise on the atomic response, where we take the electric field strength F0 = 5.

108 V/cm, the jump parameter a = 0.1 and three different frequency switching rates (W T

= 1, 10 and 100). We remark damped quasiperiodic oscillations. The case of (W T = 10)

corresponds  to  strong  damping  without  any  convergence  to  a  steady  state.  While  the

relaxation to a equilibrium state of value 1/2 is clear for a switching rate (W T = 1). The

12

damping  becomes  weak  for  (W T  =  100)  and  two  independent  beats  phenomena  are

observed. The complicated time evolution of populations is a result of Rabi oscillations

interference.

3. 2. Two–level atom in presence of Markov chain laser noise.

We  generalise  the  case  of  random  telegraph  to  a  Markov  chain,  which  treats  the

phase and amplitude fluctuations of strong laser field interacting resonantly with a two

level  system.  Figure  5.  shows  the  atomic  response  for  a  Markov  chain  composed  of

three and seven phase telegraphs, with the phase jump parameter is a = 0.4p

, the electric

field strength is F0 = 108 V/cm and (W T = 1, 100, 1000). For (W T = 1), we remark that

the  phase  noise  entirely  eliminates  the  atomic  coherence.  The  Rabi  oscillations  have

been  completely  destroyed  and  the  relaxation  process  is  rapid,  while  for  the  cases

(W T  =  100  and  W T=1000)  the  coherence  effects  are  restored  even  though  the  field  is

fluctuating.  The  damping  strength  decreases  progressively  for  (W T  =  100)  and

(W T = 1000). Similar behaviour is also observed when we increase the number of phase

telegraphs  (seven  telegraphs),  but  the  damping  becomes  more  intense  and  we  clearly

observe the convergence to a Gaussian limit.

Figure  6.  shows  the  same  situation,  as  Figure.  5,  but  for  amplitude  noise  with  the

jump  parameter  a  =  0.1.  New  beats  phenomena  which  appear  at  large  switching  rates

(W T = 100, 1000). We remark that the degree of Gaussian character and the kinetic of

convergence to a stationary state increase with the number N of random telegraphs. This

behaviour justifies the pre–Gaussian property of Markov chains.

3. 3. Three–level system in presence of random telegraph laser noise.

Multilevel  systems  show  a  variety  of  interesting  optical  effects  with  laser  fields

[22-23].  It  would  be  interesting  to  study  how  the  incoherence  sources  affect  the

population  evolution  of  multilevel  atoms.  For  the  sake  of  numerical  simplicity  (the

Floquet matrix dimentionality largely increases from two-level to multi-level), we only

extend  our  application  to  a  three-level  atom  driven  by  stochastic  strong  laser  field  at

13

resonance.  Our  model  of  three-level  atom  is  a  ladder  system  which  contains  three

discrete bound states and a continuum. It may be considered as a generalisation of the

so-called  ‘‘extended  two–level’’  model  proposed  by  Yeh  and  Eberly  [24],  where  they

have assumed that the bound–continuum dipole moments are weakly energy dependent

so  that  it  is  well  justified  to  use  the  adiabatic  following  elimination  of  the  continuum

degrees of freedom [24]. In absence of ionisation, no loss out of the system occurs, but

damping is supplied by spontaneous decay and laser noisy within the three-level system,

so that  non zero populations are maintained in a  steady-state  for  large  times.  Figure  7

clearly illustrates this behaviour in the case of one phase telegraph, with a = 0.4p

, three

different  phase  switching  rates  (W T=  0.1,  1  and  10)  and  the  electric  field  strength  is

F0 = 5. 108 V/cm. The relaxation process is observed for (W T = 1) with strong damping.
The  cases  of  (W T  =  0.1)  and  (W T  =  10)  correspond  to  weak  damping.  The  three

populations r 11 (t), r 22 (t) and r 33 (t) converge to a stationary state of value 1/3.

Figure  8.  shows  the  case  of  atomic  response  for  amplitude  noise  with  a  =  0.1,

F0 = 5. 108 V/cm and (W T= 1, 10, 100). For (W T = 1) we have a weak damping and a

strong damping for (W T = 10), the populations r 11 (t) and r 33 (t) converge to a stationary

state  of  value  3/8,  while  r 22  (t)  converge  to  a  stationary  state  of  value  1/4  with  rapid

damping than for r 11 (t) and r 33 (t). Quantum beats appear for (W T = 100) between r 11

(t)  and  r 33  (t),  while  r 22  (t)  shows  beats  independently.  It  is  apparent  that  important

asymmetries  between  the  atomic  response  in  the  case  of  phase  and  amplitude

fluctuations should be expected. This difference is justified by the fact that in the case of

amplitude fluctuations, the jump parameter a, assigned to stochastic process, appear in

  a  ),  while  in  the  case  of  phase  noisy  ,  the  dependence

term  of  laser  intensity  F0.(1  –

occurs in term of (e

 i a

 ).

3.4 Ionisation effects on field–atom interactions in presence of laser noise.

Since we have considered a strong laser field, we would have a large ionisation for

all  atoms.  In  order  to  take  into  account  of  the  noise  laser  effects  on  the  atomic

populations  and  ionisation  process,  we  will  incorporate  the  responsible  term  of

14

–
ionisation [t

 EC = - Rnc d nn’ -1/2 (Rnc + Rn’c) (1 - d nn’), where Rnc is the relaxation rate

from the excited state |næ  to the continuum |cæ ] in the motion equations (2), (6), (11) and

(14).  Two  ionisation  probabilities  are  calculated  respectively  the  instantaneous

probability  P t

 where RI and we represent the effect of different laser noises on the

average  ionisation  probability  P

I m ( ) .  Same  behaviour  can  be  observed  for  the

t

ionisation rate RI. Figure 9(a) displays the time evolution of the two-probabilities PI(t)

and  P

I m ( ) in  absence  of  noise.  Figure  9(b)  illustrates  the  influence  of  one  amplitude

t

telegraph on the average ionisation probability  P

I m ( ) . The same parameters as Figure 6

t

are  used.  The  results  depend  on  the  fluctuations  time  scale  compared  to  the  other

characteristic time scales  of the problem. The minimum ionisation rate is obtained for

(W T = 10). Figure 9(c) shows a weak effect of phase noise on the ionisation probability

and minimum ionisation rate is obtained for (W T = 1).

Figure 10. shows the response of two–level (A column) and three–level (B column)

systems  in  the  case  of  laser  phase  noise  described  by  a  random  telegraph.  The  same

parameters are taken as Figure 2.(B column) and Figure 7. The novelty in this figure is

the  incorporation  of  ionisation  process,  which  is  represented  by  the  instantaneous

ionisation probability PI(t). A loss of population has been induced by ionisation, indeed,

we  remark  that  the  populations  oscillate  in  the  same  manner  that  in  absence  of

ionisation  effect,  but  there  is  a  progressive  decay  to  the  zero  probability,  while  the

ionisation  probability  PI  (t)  increases  in  time.  The  same  behaviour  is  observed  in  the

case of laser amplitude noise and for a Markov chain.

4. Conclusion

In  this  paper,  we  have  presented  a  general  stochastic  treatment  to  incoherence

properties induced by  laser  fluctuations (phase and amplitude) and by collision effects

(frequency).  Our  method  is  based  on  the  nonperturbative  Floquet  theory  with

pre-Gaussian  processes  and  collisional  approach  modelling  the  different  sources  of

noise. A detailed discussion of the noise effects on the atomic response has been given

by resolving a master equation. We have examined the behaviour of three–level systems

at ‘high’ laser intensities where both the two-state approximation and the rotating wave

approximation  fail.  Our  treatment  has  given  good  results.  In  fact,  we  have  not  only

reproduced the results of other authors [2,3] for two-level system, (when the ionisation

effects are  neglected) but  also,  we  have  established  new  interesting  results  concerning

the  little  oscillations  which  appear  on  the  populations  r nn.    Our  results  show  a

destruction of the atomic coherence by the noise and a relaxation regime to equilibrium

state. The damping rate or relaxation kinetic is related to the size order of fluctuations.

We  have  also  investigated  the  effect  of  noise  on  the  ionisation  rates.  On  the  basis  of

these  results,  obtained  for  two–level  and  three–level  systems,  the  Floquet  approach  is

then useful in the nonperturbative treatment of the interaction processes in presence of

external  sources  of  noise,  because  any  restriction  on  the  laser  parameters  is  imposed.

The nonperturbative method is very convenient for analysing the effects of laser noise

on multi–level and real atomic systems.

Abstract:    We  present  simulation  results  of  a  design  for  negative  index 
materials that uses magnetic resonators to provide negative permeability and 
metal film for negative permittivity. We also discuss the possibility of using 
semicontinuous  metal  films  to  achieve  better  manufacturability  and 
enhanced impedance matching.

1. Introduction 

The  refractive  index  is  a  key  parameter  describing  the  interaction  of  light  with  matter.  The 
real part of a refractive index is usually considered to be positive, which is in fact true for all 

naturally  existing  materials.  However,  a  refractive  index  with  a  negative  real  part  does  not 
violate  any  physical  laws;  indeed  such  materials  will  have  some  very  interesting  properties 
making them good candidates for a plethora of valuable applications. Since such materials do 
not  exist  in  nature  they  have  to  be  artificially  fabricated.  In  a  material  characterized  by  a

Negative index of refraction was demonstrated in optical frequencies using an array of paired 
nanorods [4], an array of elliptic voids in a multilayered structure [5] and a fishnet structure 
[6]. In this paper we present a simpler and intuitive 2D geometry which shows a pronounced 
negative refractive index.

2. Magnetic resonator based on a pair of metal nanostrips 

It  was  predicted  that  a  pair  of  metal  rods  separated  by  a  dielectric  can  give  rise  to  artificial 
permeability due to a localized plasmonic resonance [7-9]. In fact a pair of nanorods can have 
two kinds of resonance: a symmetric resonance, which results in an artificial permittivity and 
an  asymmetric  resonance,  which  gives  rise  to  an  artificial  permeability;  the  two  resonances 
make it possible to have a negative refractive index as was first predicted in [8]. In general, 
these  two  resonances  occur  at  different  wavelengths.  We  use  a  simplified  2D  version  of  a 
nanorod pair as a magnetic resonator. This structure consists of two nanostrips separated by a 
dielectric  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(a).  The  strips  are  infinite  in  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the 
plane of the page (y-direction). The sample consists of an array of nanostrip pairs distributed 
periodically along the x direction. The incoming field is oriented in TM polarization as shown 
in  Fig.  1(a).  Similar  to  the  nanorod  pair,  the  nanostrip  pair  has  two  different  principal 
resonances (the magnetic and electric resonance respectively). However, we are interested in 
using this structure exclusively as a magnetic resonator. The metal nanostrips are assumed to 
be  made  of  silver  because  of  its  low  losses.  The  dielectric  spacer  between  the  nanostrips  is 
taken to be alumina because the relatively large refractive index of alumina is of assistance to 
confining the field between the nanostrips. The space between adjacent pairs of nanostrips is 
filled with silica to provide mechanical support for further lamellar stacking of this structure. 

The  complex  transmission  and  reflection  coefficients  of  this  structure  were  calculated 
using a spatial harmonic analysis based code and verified with a commercial FEM solver. The 
permittivity of silver was taken from tabulated experimental values [10]. The transmission and 
reflection coefficients were then used to retrieve the effective refractive index and impedance 
for  the  nanostrip  composite  [11,  12].  Fig.  1(c)  and  (d)  show  the  effective  permeability  and 
permittivity  for  the  following  design  parameters,  t = 30 nm,  d = 40 nm,  w = 300 nm, 
p = 600 nm  (refer  Fig.  1(a)  for  the  key  to  the  symbols).  We  note  that  there  are  two  distinct 
resonances: a magnetic resonance around 1700 nm and an electric resonance around 900 nm. 
We  also  note  the  presence  of  an  electric  and  a  magnetic  anti-resonance  at  1700 nm  and 
900 nm, respectively. This is the result of the periodicity in the structure and has been studied 
extensively  [13].  Because  of  the  presence  of  the  anti-resonances  it  is  hard  to  overlap  the 
magnetic and electric resonances, since as the electric and magnetic resonances get closer to 
each other the anti-resonances increase in strength, nullifying the resonance for one of the two 
quantities (permittivity or permeability). 

The transmittance and reflectance characteristic is shown in Fig. 1(b). We can clearly see 
the  relations  between  the  Fig.  1(b)  and  Fig.  1(c,d).  The  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the 
permeability  around  1700 nm  show  good  correspondence  with  the  transmittance  and 
absorbance  as  expected.  On  the  other  hand  the  real  part  of  the  permittivity  around  900 nm

shows good correspondence with the transmittance, but there is no absorption corresponding 
to the electric resonance. There is an absorption band below 860 nm, but that corresponds to 
the  radiation  loss  since  the  structure  starts  diffracting  light  in  the  forward  direction  below 
860 nm. Hence the electric resonance does not result in any appreciable absorbance. 

3. NIM using a magnetic resonator and continuous metallic films 

In  the  previous  section  we  saw  that  a  pair  of  nanostrips  can  generate  a  strong  magnetic 
resonance resulting in a negative permeability. Now all we need for creating a negative index 
material  is  a  negative  permittivity.  This  is  easy  to  achieve  since  noble  metals  like  gold  and 
silver  have  negative  permittivity  at  optical  frequencies  below  the  plasma  frequency.  Hence 
just adding a metal film above and below the magnetic resonator as shown in Fig. 2(a) should 
be  sufficient  to  provide  a  negative  permittivity.  We  note  that  an  alternative  way  to  provide 
negative permittivity  is  to  use  continuous wires  [14].  In our  design  the  films  are  brought  in 
contact with the strips to avoid additional resonances due to the interaction between the strips 
and the films. Our simulations have shown that such additional resonances are detrimental to 
the  magnetic  properties  of  the  nanostrip  pair.  The  additional  layer  of  silica  on  the  top 
functions as a seal preventing the silver from being oxidized or sulfurized due to exposure to 
air. Intuitively, only one metal film should suffice since we can use a single thick film instead 
of  two  thin  films  to  provide  similar  permittivity.  There  are  two  reasons  for  using  two  films 
instead of one. Using two films ensures that the structure is symmetric and justifies the use of 
the retrieval formula to extract the effective optical parameters of the structure. The retrieval 
procedure  assumes  that  the  structure  is  symmetric.  Using  a  single  film  would  also  generate 
additional  resonances  due  to  the  interaction  between  the  isolated  strip  and  the  film.  This 
interaction is suppressed through the use of two films.

ts = 20 nm; (c) Effective permeability; (d) Effective permittivity. 

The dimensions of the nanostrips were taken from the previous section and simulated for 
6 nm, 10 nm and 20 nm silver films. The structure was coated with a 20 nm thick silica layer. 
The  effective  refractive  index,  permeability  and  permittivity  are  shown  in  Fig.  2.  Here  the 
refractive index goes negative for all cases, but the permeability goes negative only when the 
metal  film  is  6 nm  or  10 nm  thick.  Also  the  imaginary  part  of  the  refractive  index  is  much 
lower when the real part of the permeability is negative. The sample with 6 nm thick films has 
a  maximum  transmittance  of  27%  with  a  negative  real  part  of  the  refractive  index  at  a 
wavelength of  1520 nm.  The  refractive  index  at  this  wavelength  is −2.38+0.84i. However  it 
should be remembered that it is almost impossible to fabricate a 6 nm thick continuous silver 
film.  The  silver  film  would  be  essentially  semi-continuous  at  this  thickness.  Typically,  the 
film thickness should be at least 20 nm to ensure that the silver is continuous, but as it is clear 
from Fig. 2, the properties are significantly worse with a 20 nm thick film. For example the 
minimum of  Im( )n  is about 2.5 times as large for the 20 nm thick silver films as compared to 
the 6 nm thick films (Fig. 2(b)). This is a direct consequence of  Re( )

μ >  (Fig. 2(c)).

We also notice that the magnetic resonance is at shorter wavelengths for the thicker films. 
The  addition  of  the  metal  films  causes  the  currents  in  the  nanostrip  to  leak  into  the  metal 
films, especially towards the ends of the nanostrips. This reduces the effective width (w) of 
the nanostrips which results in a shorter resonance wavelength. This leakage of current also 
has the effect of diminishing the resonance in permeability. 

4. NIM using a magnetic resonator and semicontinuous metallic films 

So  far,  our  simulations  have  shown  that  combining  continuous  metal  film  with  nanostrip 
magnetic resonators could easily yield a negative index material. Unfortunately, that requires

unrealistically thin metal films. The problem arises because silver has a highly negative real 
part  for  it’s  permittivity  around  1.5 µm,  but  the  magnetic  resonator  can  not  provide  a 
comparable  value  of  negative  permeability.  This  results  in  a  huge  impedance  mismatch  and 
subsequent  large  reflection  which  degrades  the  magnetism  of  the  entire  structure.  Another 
way to look at the problem is to consider the electromagnetic shielding provided by the metal 
film.  A  thick  film  would  shield  the  incoming  field  more  efficiently,  thus  suppressing  the 
performance of the magnetic resonator. An obvious way to circumvent this problem is to use a 
thinner  metal  film,  except  the  minimum  thickness  is  limited  by  the  material  properties  and 
fabrication tolerances. 

Instead  of  bulk  metal,  the  film  can  be  formed  with  a  mixture  of  silica  and  metal 
(semicontinuous metal films, SMF). Such films can be fabricated using very basic techniques 
like  sub-monolayer  evaporation.  The  permittivity  of  a  SMF  can  be  well  described  by  the 
eε ) of a 
effective medium theory (EMT) [15]. According to EMT, the effective permittivity (
d-dimensional  metal-dielectric  composite  consisting  of  a  metal  with  permittivity 
mε and  a 
f−   is 
filling  fraction  of  f ,  and  a  dielectric  with  permittivity 
given by Eq. (1). This is a quadratic equation which has two solutions for 
eε . We select the 
solution that has a positive imaginary part ( Im(

The performance of EMT has been tested against exact solution using numerical methods 
[16] and it has been confirmed that EMT provides good agreement with the numerical method 

except for some minor differences. According to EMT, the permittivity of a SMF is much less 
negative as compared to bulk metal films. Hence we have a SMF that is thick enough to be 
fabricated easily while having a real part of the permittivity which can be matched with the 
permeability created by magnetic resonators. This is critical for impedance matching. 

For  example,  consider  a  structure  similar  to  that  of  Fig.  2,  simulated  in  the  previous 
section. This time, semicontinuous silver films are used instead of the continuous silver films. 
We  assume  the  SMF  to  have  a  metal  filling  fraction  of  65%.  The  physical  thickness  of  the 
SMF  is  20 nm,  which  is  quite  easy  to  achieve.  The  permittivity  of  the  SMF  was  calculated 
using two dimensional EMT. The results of the simulation are shown in Fig. 3. 

The  real  part  of  the  refractive  index  is  negative  between  1500 nm  and  1650 nm.  The 
transmittance spectrum has a maximum value of 27% at 1570 nm. The refractive index has a 
value  of  −1.85+0.93i  at  the  wavelength  of  maximum  transmittance.  We  note  that  the 
transmittance  is  better  than  the  case  with  10 nm  continuous  silver  film  although  the  SMF 
contains more metal than a 10 nm continuous silver film. 

5. Conclusions 

We  examined  the  magnetic  behavior  of  nanostrip  pair  arrays.  The  nanostrip  pair  array  was 
found  to  posses  a  strong  magnetic  resonance,  which  results  in  a  negative  permeability.  By 
changing the dimensions of the nanostrip, the region of negative permeability is easy to tune 
over a wide range of wavelengths. 

The nanostrip pair array can be modified without difficulty to exhibit a negative refractive 
index  by  fusing  metal  films  on  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  nanostrip  pair.  The  fusing  of  the 
films with the nanostrips is essential to avoid additional resonances due to the interaction of 
the nanostrips with the films. 

A  homogeneous  silver  film  provides  a  highly  negative  permittivity,  which  can  not  be 
matched with the permeability provided by the magnetic resonator. The resulting impedance 
mismatch  significantly  deteriorates  the  properties  of  the  complete  structure.  Hence  we  use 
semicontinuous  metal  films  (SMF)  to  take  this  problem  into  account.  The  use  of  SMFs 
provides an additional degree of freedom in optimizing the behavior of such metamaterials.  

Certainly, there are other ways to achieving the same goal, using for example an array of 
elliptical  voids  [5]  or  a  fishnet  geometry  [6].  The  fishnet  geometry  is  typically  fabricated 
using E-beam lithography, which severely limits the size of the sample. In contrast, a larger 
array of elliptical voids can be fabricated with interference lithography, though such a sample 
has  the  possible  disadvantage  of  variable  width  of  the  magnetic  resonators,  since  both  the 
shape and dimensions of the voids are limited by the resolution of the fabrication process. In 
our geometry a large array of magnetic resonators can be fabricated with a high fidelity using 
interference  lithography,  since  only  two  interfering  beams  are  required  for  fabricating  the 
magnetic substructure. The semicontinuous films can be deposited efficiently using a standard 
E-beam  or  thermal  evaporation.  Thus  our  strategy  allows  for  the  fabrication  of  larger 
structures through relatively inexpensive means. 

We  could  also  extend  the  idea  and  fabricate  the  nanostrips  using  semicontinuous  metal 
instead  of  bulk  metal.  This  will  provide  us  with  more  flexible  means  of  making 
manufacturable resonant metallic elements and adjusting their properties.

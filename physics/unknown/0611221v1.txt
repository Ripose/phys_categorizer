1.  Introduction 

In  the  reference  [1]  a  new  theory  of  cosmology  has  been  established  which  leads  to  the  following 
distinct properties of cosmos: the energy of matter field might originate from the gravitational field; the big 
bang might not have occurred; the fields of the dark energy and some parts of the dark matter would not be 
matter  fields  but  might  be  gravitational  fields.  These  distinct  properties  are  deduced  from  the  following 
premises: 1), the Lagrangian density of pure gravitational field is supposed to be

Some  people  doubt  that  Ref.[1]  contains  fundamental  mistakes  and  do  not  believe  the  above 
conclusions of Ref.[1]. The aim of this paper is to clear up this doubt. For this purpose we shall study firstly 
the  fundamental  properties  of  Lagrangian  density  for  a  gravitational  system  in  the  more  general  case  and 
then explain the rationality for the Lagrangian density of a pure gravitational field

At  the  same  time  we  shall  expound  the  correctness  of  the Lorentz  and  Levi-Civita’s  conservation  laws  and 
compare  the  virtues  and  the  defects  between  the  new  theory  of  cosmology  and  the  prevalent  big  bang 
cosmology. These studies might help clearing up the doubt about the premises of the new theory of cosmology 
and the conclusions of Ref.[1].

In the new theory of cosmology established at Ref.[1], the matter Lagrangian

  is also denoted by 

Eq.(6):

Eq.(9) and Eq.(10) have summarized the general character of the General Relativity and the gravitational theory 
used at Ref.[1], consequently these two theories must all have the general properties deduced from Eq.(9) and 
Eq.(10) which we shall talk about in the following.

Eqs.(25-28)  stem  from  the  symmetry  of  transformation  Eq.(11)  ,  the  conservation  laws  of  energy-
-momentum tensor density for a gravitational system can be derived from these identities; we shall discuss the 
derivation  in  the  following  section.  Eqs.(22-24)  stem  from  the  symmetry  of  transformation  Eq.(12)  ,  the 
conservation laws of spin density for a gravitational system [2] can be derived from these identities; since the 
conservation laws of spin density for a gravitational system require to study specially, we shall not discuss the 
problem in this paper.

spontaneously.  By  using  Boltzmann’s  relation  S=k  ln  N  ,  we  have  shown  that  this  view  is  incorrect  [1,10].  An 
important debate was evoked about the definitions of energy-momentum tensor density for gravitational field and 
the  related  conservation  laws  in  1917-1918  [9];  Einstein  is  on  the  one  side  of  that  debate,  his  opponents  are 
Levi-Civita and others. This debate had not reached unanimity, but because Einstein enjoyed great prestige among 
academic circles and many scholars followed him, therefore the definition Eq.(44) and the Einstein’s conservation 
laws have become the prevalent views now in the gravitational theory. The author hold that, as the Lorentz and 
Levi-Civita’s  conservation  laws  being  to  connect  intimately  with  the  Einstein’s  conservation  laws,  these  two 
conservation laws are all well worth to consider carefully. Which law is correct on physical side ? This question 
can answer only by experimental and observational tests. To affirm subjectively a law is not suitable. In the last 
few years the author have thoroughly studied Lorentz and Levi-Civita’s conservation laws and found that these 
conservation laws have abundant physical contents [1,10-13] which can be tested via experiments or observations. 
In these respects, the Lorentz and Levi-Civita’s conservation laws will undoubtedly be used as one of important 
theoretical foundations to establish a new cosmology.

This equation is just Eq.(1). 

It  is  evident  that  all  of  these  gravitational  field  equations  are  fully  rational  and  well  worth  a  more 
careful examination. Which gravitational field equations is correct ? This question can only be answered by 
experimental  and  observational  tests.  To  affirm  subjectively  a  gravitational  field  equations  is  not  suitable. 
Anyhow,  the  modified  Einstein’s  field  equations  i.e.  Eq.(1)  will  undoubtedly  be  used  as  one  of  important 
theoretical foundations to establish a new cosmology. 

4. Some comparisons between the standard big bang cosmology and the new cosmology established in 
Ref.[1]   

The detailed content of the new cosmology have been presented in Ref.[1], we shall not repeat to write 
it in this paper; we shall make only some comparisons between the standard big bang cosmology (SBBC) and 
the new cosmology (NC) established in Ref.[1]. 

The common or similar character of SBBC and NC are:   
1), The universe is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and isotropic [1] ( this assumption is called 

 

 

15

cosmological principle), so the universe has the Robertson-Walker metric [5]

2), The universe is expanding. 

3), These two cosmologies all could explain the microwave radiation background [1,5]; in SBBC it is 
believed that the microwave radiation background is just the left-over radiation from the big bang; in NB it is 
supposed  that  the  universe  might  have  taken  place  a  change  from  the  radiation-dominated  era  to  the 
matter-dominated era which is similar with SBBC, and it is considered that the microwave radiation background 
is just the left-over radiation from this change. 

The different character of SBBC and NC are: 

1), In SBBC it is believed that the universe has a beginning state called the big bang, but in NB it is 
believed  that  the  big  bang  might  never  have  occurred  since  NB  maintains  that  the  universe  is  without  a 

beginning and without an end and considers that the state

∞ might never have existed [1].   

→ρM

2), In NB there is the possibility that the energy of matter field might originate from the gravitational 
field [1], but SBBC does not study the origin of the matter field’s energy, it is assumed that the total energy of 
matter fields (including the inflation field) has existed since the big bang. 

3),  In  SBBC  the  observed  abundances  of  light  nuclei  in  the  universe  are  explained  as  the  result  of 

nucleon-synthesis taking place in the early universe at a temperature of about10   (
the observed abundances of light nuclei in the universe could be explained with the same reason as SBBC, but it 
also could be explained that the light nuclei in the universe are formed from hydrogen nuclei in the interiors of 
stars [1]. 

). In NB although

4), NB affirms that 

λ

  are two quantities to represent the pure gravitational field and 

µν

g

and µν
D

does  not  consider  them  as  the  quantities  to  represent  matter  field  in  essence, 

µν

λ

g

and µν
D

could  be 

interpreted as dark energy and a main part of dark matter respectively; but in SBBC although  gµν
interpreted as dark energy also, yet it is always considered to be a part of matter field; especially there is no 
quantity  Dµν  in SBBC, the dark matter is looked entirely as some kinds of material matter [1]. 

could be   

λ

From the above comparisons it is evident that the range of study for NB is greater than that for SBBC；
moreover, through studing NB several experimentst and observations to test whether SBBC or NB is correct are 
advanced.As  many  new  evidences  of  observations  [14, 15,  16]  have  brought  out  some  crucial  weaknesses  of 
SBBC. It is necessary to introduce new concepts and new theories, so I believe that to study NB is significant.

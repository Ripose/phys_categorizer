Abstract 

In  this  study  we  address  the  feasibility  and  main  properties  of  a  positron  emission 
tomograph  (PET)  based  on  RPCs.  The  concept,  making  use  of  the  converter-plate 
principle, takes advantage of the intrinsic layered structure of RPCs and its simple and 
economic  construction.  The  extremely  good  time  and  position  resolutions  of  RPCs 
also allow the TOF-PET imaging technique to be considered.  

Monte-Carlo  simulations,  supported  by  experimental  data,  are  presented  and  the 

main advantages and drawbacks for applications of potential interest are discussed.

1 – Introduction 

Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  is  a 
radiotracer  imaging  technique  in  which  tracer 
compounds 
labelled  with  positron  emitting 
radionuclides  are  injected  into  the  object  of 
study. These tracer compounds can then be used 
to track biomedical and physiological processes, 
with  applications 
the  early 
ranging 
detection of cancer to neurophysiology studies. 

from 

joining 

the  chord 

After  a  short  path  length  the  positron 
annihilates  with  an  electron  of  the  medium 
emitting simultaneously two almost anti-parallel 
511 keV  photons.  The  coincident  detection  of 
both  photons  identifies  the  occurrence  of  an 
annihilation  along 
the 
detection  points  and  the  accumulation  of  such 
data  allows  the  reconstruction  of  the  activity 
distribution in the tissues. 
If,  additionally, 

time 
difference (difference in flight time between the 
pair of photons) is measured (TOF-PET) with a 
t

the 
annihilation  along  the  chord  may  be  identified

In  any  foreseeable  system  the  localization 
accuracy  given  by  eq.(2)  is  much  coarser  than 
the  desired  image  granularity  (few  mm)  and 
therefore  the  image  reconstruction  procedure 
cannot  be  avoided.  However,  by  including  the 
TOF  information,  along  with  other  advantages 
[1],  one  gains  a  sensitivity  improvement  of  the 
order  of  L LD
,  where  L  is  the  typical  object 
length,  thus  reducing  the  number  of  events 
needed for the image reconstruction [2]. For this 
reason the investigation of TOF-PET systems is 
being actively pursued (e.g. [3], [4]). 

In order to compare a TOF-PET system with 
a  conventional  (non-TOF)  one  and  account  for 
the  above-mentioned 
in  sensitivity 
increase 
information,  one  may 
when  using  TOF 
introduce  an  intrinsic  sensitivity  merit  factor

However,  in  a  practical  PET  tomograph 
many  additional  factors  determine  the  overall 

system  sensitivity  in  terms  of  dose  given  to  the 
patient  for  an  exam  requiring  a  certain  image 
quality  (see  for  instance  [5],  [6]  and  references 
therein).  Examples  of  such  factors  would 
include:

detector;

For  most  of  these  performance  factors  there

The  RPC  TOF-PET  concept  is  based  on  the

advantage  of  the  naturally  layered  structure  of 
RPCs,  of  its  simple  and  economic  construction, 
excellent  time  resolution  (60 ps s
  even  for 
single  gaps  equipped  with  position-sensitive 
readout [8], [9]) and very good intrinsic position 
accuracy (50 m m online in digital readout mode 
[10]).

Figure 2 – Simulated  (GEANT4)  quantum  efficiency  as  a 
function  of  the  incident photon energy for a stack of counters 
(see  Figure 1).  For  a  large  number  of  plates  the  values  scale 
almost linearly with the energy above  ~ 100 keV. Only a small 
fraction  of  the  secondary  interactions  (from  counter-scattered 
photons) is visible. 

The  proposed 

system  would 

show  a 
sensitivity  handicap  by  a  factor  of  three  when 
compared with a standard crystal PET, all other 
variables  being  the  same.  However  for  some 
special  applications  (see  section  3.5)  there  are 
advantages  in  the  present  proposal  that  may 
easily outweigh this handicap. 

Using  photon  energy  distribution  data 
generated  by 
the  public  domain  SIMSET 
simulation  package  [13] it was determined that 
the  energy  sensitivity  feature  of  the  present 
approach  is  equivalent,  in  terms  of  rejection  of 
coincidences involving a scattered photon, to an 
energy discrimination threshold of 300 keV. 

3.2. Position resolution 

A  strong  point  of 

the  converter  plate 
approach  is  its  position  resolution  capability 
(e.g. [14]).  

In Figure 3 we show the GEANT4-simulated 
image  of  a  disc  phantom  in  water  imaged  by  a 
16-layer counter with a structure similar to that 
shown  in  Figure 1.  The  inner  radius  was  4 cm 
and the stack was 16 mm thick. All high-energy 
processes were simulated including the positron 
path range (using the b energy distribution from 
18F)  and  photon  non-colinearity.  The  FWHM 
RPC  position  resolution  was  assumed  to  be 
twice  the  width  of  the  gas  gap  (2·0.3=0.6 mm) 
for electrons ejected from the anode and 0.2 mm 
for  electrons  ejected  from  the  cathode.  The 
image  was  reconstructed  by 
the  standard 
algorithm  of 
filtered  backprojection.  The 
contrast of the resulting image was enhanced by 
subtraction of the low frequency background. 

Figure 1 – Counter  construction  assumed  in  the  GEANT4 
simulations presented below with a schematic indication of the 
most  relevant  physical  processes.  Each  layer  has  a  total 
thickness  of  1 mm  resulting  in  a  10 cm  thick  100-layer 
counter. 

Other  approaches  based  on  the  converter 
plate principle, although offering a much poorer 
time resolution, may be found in [11], [12].

Calculations  show  that  a  stack  of  very  thin 
lead  foils  obtains  the  best  results.  However,  for 
keeping the mechanical accuracy of the counter, 
the  foils  must  be  mounted  on  a  rigid  resistive 
electrode.  A  possible  material  may  be  lead-
loaded  acrilic  (LA  -  used  for  transparent  X-ray 
protections),  which  offers  its  best  performance 
at a convenient thickness of 0.5 to 1 mm.  

We  measured  a  quantum  efficiency  of 
0.0044  for  single  lead  foils  in  good  agreement 
with 
the  corresponding 
GEANT4 simulation yielded a value of 0.0042, 
validating GEANT4 for this application. 

([7],  [12]),  while 

Further  simulations suggest that a 140-layer 
counter  with  the  structure  shown  in  Figure 1 
should reach an efficiency per photon e TOF=22% 
(Figure 2), yielding a relative merit factor eq.(3)

Simulations  by  other  authors  [17]  suggest 
that  increasing  the  axial  FOV  of  a  standard 
crystal  PET  from  20  to  60 cm  would  improve 
the noise-equivalent count rate (NEC1 [18]) by a 
factor of five to eight. Such results are shown in 
Figure 4 along with our own simulations, based 
on the SIMSET package [13].  

Our  curves  correspond  to  a  80 liter  water 
cylinder  with  a  diameter  of  24 cm  and  1.8 m 
length.  The  simulation  is  meant  to  determine 
only  geometrical  effects  and  doesn't  include 
rate-dependent  effects  like  system  dead  time  or 
the  results  of 
random  coincidences,  while 
the  Zubal

phantom,  using 
larger  counting  rates  and 
modelling  rate-dependent  effects.  To  allow  a 
comparison between both results the curve from 
[17]  was  normalized  to  a  NEC  sensitivity  of 
10 kHz/(kBq/ml)  for  a  20  cm  FOV  (a common 
value  for  3D-PET:  e.g.[19])  and  our  curve  to 
3.3 kHz/(kBq/ml) 
eq.(4).  Two 
acceptance angles2 were considered.

4. – Conclusions 

We  assessed  several  key  features  of  an 
economic  and  positionally  accurate  RPC-based 
approach  to  the  TOF-PET  medical  imaging 
technique.  

Efficiency  up  to  22%  for  511 keV  photons 
may be achievable for a 140-layer counter along 
with an energy sensitivity equivalent in terms of 
scatter rejection to an energy cutoff at 300 keV.  
of 
300 ps FWHM  was  measured 
for  511 keV 
photons,  comparing  favourably  with  the  values 
achievable with segmented fast crystals.

The  simple  structure  of  RPC-type  detectors 
and  the  consequent  possibility  of  economic 
construction  in  large  areas  opens  the  way  to 
consider  also  whole-body  field-of-view  TOF-
PET  counters.  Simulations  suggest  that  such 
systems  may  reach  an  overall  sensitivity  one 
order  of  magnitude  larger  than  present  day 
crystal-based PET scanners. Such improvements 
may open new medical applications by lowering 
considerably  the  radiation  hazard  involved  in 
and 
whole-body 
simultaneously increase the patient throughput.

Abstract

The gamma radiation in samples of a variety of natural tiling rocks (granites) imported

in Cyprus for use in the building industry was measured, employing high-resolution

γ−ray spectroscopy. The rock samples were pulverized, sealed in 1 litre plastic

Marinelli beakers, and measured in the laboratory with a live-time between 10 and 14

hours each. From the measured γ−ray spectra, activity concentrations were determined

for 232Th (range from 1 to 906 Bq kg−1), 238U (from 1 to 588 Bq kg−1) and 40K (from 50

to 1606 Bq kg−1). Elemental concentrations mean values of (35.2 ± 8.4) ppm, (6.2 ± 1.8)

ppm and (4.0 ± 0.2) % were deduced, for thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively.

The total absorbed dose rates in air calculated from the concentrations of the three

radionuclides, 232Th and 238U series and 40K, ranged from 7 to 1209 nGy h−1 for full

1. Introduction

Gamma radiation from radionuclides which are characterized by half-lives comparable

to the age of the earth, such as 40K and the radionuclides from the 238U and 232Th series,

and their decay products, represents the main external source of irradiation to the human

body. The absorbed dose rate in air from cosmic radiation outdoors at sea level is about

30 nGy h−1 for the southern hemisphere (UNSCEAR 2000 Report). External exposures

outdoors arise from terrestrial radionuclides occurring at trace levels in all ground

formations. Therefore,

the natural environmental

radiation mainly depends on

geological and geographical conditions (Florou and Kritidis, 1992). Higher radiation

levels are associated with igneous rocks, such as granite, and lower levels with

sedimentary rocks. There are exceptions, however, as some shales and phosphate rocks

have relatively high content of radionuclides (UNSCEAR 2000 Report).

Granites are the most abundant plutonic rocks of mountain belts and continental shield

areas. They occur in great batholiths that may occupy thousands of square kilometres

and are usually closely associated with quartz monzonite, granodiorite, diorite, and

gabbro. They are extremely durable and scratch resistant;

their hardness lends

themselves for the stone to be mechanically polished to a high gloss finish. Their variety

of colour and unique heat and scratch resistant properties makes them ideal for use as

2

work-surface or as flooring or external and internal cladding. They mainly consist of

coarse grains of quartz, potassium feldspar and sodium feldspar. Other common

minerals that granites consist of, include mica and hornblende. Typical granites are

chemically composed by 75 % silica, 12 % aluminium, less than 5 % potassium oxide,

less than 5 % soda, as well as by lime, iron, magnesia, and titania in smaller quantities.

Originally, it was widely believed that granites were formed mainly from magmatic

differentiation of basaltic magma, evidence that was considered to indicate a

metamorphic origin. However, because of the large quantities of granites that occur in

nature, geologists believe now that most of the granites have been formed either by

melting, partial melting, or metamorphism of deeply buried shale and sandstone.

Granites, therefore, are the result of rapidly injected coalescing sheets of magma, each

of which cooled independent of the other sheets. Evidence of intrusion or great mobility

indicates an igneous origin that stems from melting of sediments, and consequently

granite dykes are clearly igneous (Snelling and Woodmorappe, 1998).

In this paper, the results from gamma radiation measurements in samples of a variety of

natural

tiling rocks imported in Cyprus and sold under the commercial name of

“granites” are presented. These results are of general interest since such rocks are

globally used as building and ornamental materials. The measurements have been

carried out in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Department of Physics, University

of Cyprus, using a high-resolution γ−ray spectroscopic system.

2. Experimental method

2.1 Gamma-ray detection system

A stand-alone high-resolution spectroscopic system is used for the measurement of the

energy spectrum of the emitted gamma rays in the energy range between 50 keV and

3

3000 keV. The system consists of a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (coaxial

cylinder of 55 mm in diameter and 73 mm in length) with an efficiency of 30 %, relative

to a 3″×3″ NaI(Tl) scintillator. During operation the detector is cooled down by liquid

nitrogen, and its warm-up sensor is coupled to the high-voltage detector bias supply,

which is equipped with a remote shutdown feature. The signal-processing electronics

includes a spectroscopy main amplifier which incorporates an efficient pile-up rejector,

and a Multi-Channel Buffer (MCB) which is a PC-based plug-in PCI card consisting of

an 8k Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC). An advanced Multi-Channel Analyser

(MCA) emulation software (MAESTRO-32) enables data acquisition, storage, display

and online analysis of the acquired gamma spectra.

The detector is surrounded by a graded-Z cylindrical shield consisting of lead, iron, and

aluminium with thickness of 5 cm, 1 cm, and 1 cm, respectively, which provides an

efficient suppression of the background gamma radiation present at the laboratory site.

The energy-dependent detection efficiency has been determined using a calibrated 152Eu

gamma reference source (standard Marinelli beaker with 85 mm bore diameter), which

has an active volume of 1000 ml and an average density of 1 g cm−3. The energy

resolution (FWHM) achieved in the measurements is 1.8 keV at the 1.33 MeV reference

transition of 60Co.

2.2 Sample preparation and counting

A total of 28 different kinds of “granites” of those imported in Cyprus have been

collected (Table 1). The measured samples were pulverized, sieved through 0.2 mm

mesh, sealed in standard 1000 ml Marinelli beakers, dry-weighed and stored for four

weeks before counting in order to allow the in-growth of uranium and thorium decay

products and achievement of equilibrium for 238U and 232Th with their respective

4

progeny (Myrick et al., 1983). However, significant non-equilibrium is uncommon in

rocks older than 106 years, and the 232Th series may be considered in equilibrium in

most geological environments (Chiozzi et al., 2002). Each sample was put into the

shielded HPGe detector and measured for a live-time between 10 and 14 hours (a

typical spectrum is shown in Fig. 1). Prior

to the samples measurement,

the

environmental gamma background at the laboratory site has been determined with an

empty Marinelli beaker under identical measurement conditions. It has been later

subtracted from the measured γ−ray spectra of each sample.

The offline analysis of each measured γ−ray spectrum has been carried out by a

dedicated software programme (GammaVision-32), which performs a simultaneous fit

to all the statistically significant photopeaks appearing in the spectrum. Menu-driven

reports were generated which included the centroid channel, energy, net area counts,

background counts, intensity and width of identified and unidentified peaks in the

spectrum, as well as peak and average activity in Bq kg−1 for each detected radionuclide.

The results of the reported activity concentrations obtained for each of the measured

samples, as well as average activity and standard deviation are summarised in Table 1.

It is noted here that no other radionuclide than naturally occurring were detected in the

measured samples.

2.3 Calculation of elemental concentrations

Calculations of count rates for each detected photopeak and radiological concentrations

(activity per mass unit) of detected radionuclides depend on the establishment of secular

equilibrium in the samples. Due to the much smaller lifetime of the daughter

radionuclides in the decay series of 232Th and 238U,

the 232Th concentration was

determined from the average concentrations of 212Pb and 228Ac in the samples, and that

5

of 238U was determined from the average concentrations of the 214Pb and 214Bi decay

products (Hamby and Tynybekov, 2000). Thus, an accurate radiological concentration

of 232Th and 238U was determined, whereas a true measurement of 40K concentration

was made. The specific activity (in Bq kg−1),

EiA , of a nuclide i and for a peak at energy

E, is given by:

A

where

EiN is the Net Peak Area of a peak at energy Ε,

Eε the detection efficiency at

energy Ε, t the counting live-time,

dγ the gamma ray yield per disintegration of the

specific nuclide for a transition at energy E, and Ms the mass in kg of the measured

sample. If there is more than one peak in the energy range of analysis, then the peak

activities are averaged and the result is the weighted average nuclide activity.

Radiological concentrations of 232Th, 238U and 40K were then converted into total

elemental concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively, according to

the following expression:

where FΕ is the fraction of element E in the sample, ΜΕ is the atomic mass (kg mol−1),

λE is the decay constant (s−1) of the parent radioisotope, ΝΑ is Avogadro’s number

(6.023×1023 atoms mol−1), fA,E is the fractional atomic abundance of 232Th, 238U or 40K

in nature, C is a constant (with a value of 100 or 1,000,000) that converts the ratio of

the element’s mass to soil mass into a percentage or ppm, and Αi is the measured

radiological concentration of 40K (n=1) or that of the selected daughter radionuclides in

the decay series of 232Th and 238U (n=2). Total elemental concentrations are reported in

6

units of parts per million (ppm) for thorium and uranium, and of percent (%) for

potassium.

2.4 Derivation of the absorbed dose rates and effective dose rates

If natural radioactive nuclides are uniformly distributed in the ground, dose rates at 1 m

above the ground surface are calculated by the following formula (Kohshi et al., 2001):

Dose rate (nGy h−1) = Radiological concentration (Bq kg−1)

×××× Conversion factor (nGy h−1 per Bq kg−1)

(3)

In order to calculate the exposure rates 1 m above ground level for distributed sources of

gamma emitters in soil, conversion factors (absorbed dose rate in air per unit activity

per unit of soil mass, nGy h−1 per Bq kg−1) were extensively calculated during the last

forty years by many researchers. In the present work,

the considered dose rate

conversion factors for the 232Th and 238U series, and for 40K, used in all dose rate

calculations are those determined by Saito et al. (1990) and used extensively for all

similar calculations in the UNSCEAR 1993 Report. It should be pointed out here that,

using this calculation, the dose rate for the 232Th and 238U series is the average of the

respective

radiological

concentrations multiplied

by

the

conversion

factors

corresponding to each series. The total dose rate for each of the measured samples is the

sum of the dose rates contributed by both series of 232Th and 238U, and by 40K.

The building materials act as sources of radiation and also as shields against outdoor

radiation (UNSCEAR 1993 Report). In massive houses made of different building

materials such as stone, bricks, concrete or granite, the factor that mainly affects the

indoor absorbed dose is the activity concentrations of natural radionuclides in those

materials, while radiation emitted by sources outdoors is efficiently absorbed by the

7

walls. Consequently, dose rates in air indoors will be elevated accordingly to the

concentrations of natural radionuclides used in construction materials. In order to

facilitate the calculation of dose rates in air from different combinations of the three

radionuclides in building materials and by applying the appropriate conversion factors,

an activity utilization index is constructed that is given by the following expression:





(4)

where CTh, CU and CK are actual values of the activities per unit mass (Bq kg−1) of 232Th,

238U, and 40K in the building materials considered;

Thf

,

Uf

and

Kf

are the fractional

contributions to the total dose rate in air from the standard or typical concentrations of

these radionuclides. In the NEA 1979 Report, typical activities per unit mass of 232Th,

238U, and 40K in building materials ATh, AU and AK are referred to be 50, 50 and 500

Bq kg−1, respectively. The activity utilization index is, finally, weighted for the mass

proportion of the building materials in a house by being multiplied by a factor wm that

represents the fractional usage of those materials in the dwelling with the characteristic

activity. For full utilization of a typical masonry (CTh = CU = 50 Bq kg−1 and CK = 500

Bq kg−1) the activity utilization index is unity by definition and is deemed to imply a

dose rate of 80 nGy h−1.

Finally, in order to estimate the annual effective doses, one has to take into account the

conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to effective dose and the indoor

occupancy factor. In the UNSCEAR recent reports (1988, 1993, 2000), the Committee

used 0.7 Sv Gy−1 for the conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to effective

dose received by adults, and 0.8 for the indoor occupancy factor, implying that 20 % of

8

time is spent outdoors, on average, around world. The effective dose rate indoors, in

units of mSv per year, is calculated by the following formula:

Effective dose rate (mSv y−−−−1) = Dose rate (nGy h−−−−1) ×××× 24 h ×××× 365.25 d

×××× 0.8 (occupancy factor) ×××× 0.7 Sv Gy−−−−1 (conversion coefficient) ×××× 10−−−−6

(5)

In Table 2, the results obtained for the activity utilization index and the total absorbed

dose rate in air for various fractional masses of the twenty-eight “granite” samples

considered in this paper, as well as the indoor effective dose assessment for a specific

fractional mass for each sample are displayed.

3. Results and discussion

Activity concentrations of 232Th ranged from 1 to 906 Bq kg−1, of 238U from 1 to 588

Bq kg−1 and of 40K from 50 to 1606 Bq kg−1. From the 28 samples measured in this

study, “Café Brown” appears to have the highest concentrations for all the elements

investigated, reaching levels of 906 Bq kg−1 for 232Th, 588 Bq kg−1 for 238U, and 1606

Bq kg−1 for 40K. “Rosso Balmoral” and “New Imperial” exhibit the second and third

highest concentration of 232Th reaching 490 Bq kg−1 and 273 Bq kg−1, respectively, and

of 238U reaching 162 Bq kg−1 and 285 Bq kg−1, respectively, while “Upatuba” appears to

have the second higher concentration of 40K reaching 1581 Bq kg−1. All measured

samples except of two, named “Astudo” and “Nero Africa”, have concentrations of

potassium above the value of 1000 Bq kg−1. In addition, 13 samples appear to have

concentration of 232Th higher than 100 Bq kg−1, while only 6 samples exhibit

concentration of 238U that surpass the above limit. “Nero Africa” demonstrates the

lowest concentrations for all the investigated elements, showing zero activity levels for

232Th and 238U, and levels of 50 Bq kg−1 for 40K. Analytical results for the activity

9

concentrations of 232Th, 238U and of 40K determined for each of the measured samples

are displayed in Table 1.

The calculated elemental concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium are plotted

in Fig. 2 for the twenty-eight samples. The highest elemental concentrations of thorium

are exhibited by the samples “Café Brown” and “Rosso Balmoral”, with values that

reach levels of 222 and 120 ppm, respectively. “Café Brown” and “New Imperial”

appear to have the highest concentrations of uranium reaching levels of 48 and 23 ppm,

respectively.

In addition, “Café Brown” and “Upatuba” present

the highest

concentrations of potassium reaching 5.3 and 5.2 %,

respectively. The lowest

concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium are exhibited by “Nero Africa” and

“Upatuba”, by “Nero Africa” and “Verte Brazil” and by “Nero Africa” and “ Astudo”,

respectively. As it seems, “Café Brown” and “Nero Africa” appear to have the highest

and the lowest elemental concentrations, respectively, for all the elements investigated.

For comparison, Chiozzi et al. (2002) have performed a series of investigations on

different rock types at

the Alps-Apennines transition, Italy, and found elemental

concentrations being in the range of 0.3−16.7 ppm, 0.3−5.6 ppm, and 0.14−5.14 %, for

thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively. In addition, potassium concentrations in

a wide variety of rock types are estimated to range from approximately 0.1 to 3.5 %

(Kohman and Saito, 1954).

To estimate the effect of using atypical materials such as granites or other natural tiling

rocks, it is necessary to determine the fractional utilization by mass for each of the

measured samples and identify the associated dose rate. The activity utilization index

estimated using the fractional contribution to the dose rate from the three radionuclides

for the 28 samples are displayed in Table 2. As the mass fractional utilization of each

radionuclide varies from sample to sample, the activity utilization index ranges from

10

0.09 for sample “Nero Africa” to 15.11 for sample “Café Brown”. It should be noted

that, twenty-two of the measured samples appear to have an activity utilization index

that ranges from 1.0 to 3.0, four of them surpass the above-mentioned range and only

two samples have values under that range ( ≤ 1.0).

The total absorbed dose rates calculated from the concentrations of the nuclides of the

232Th and 238U series, and of 40K, for full utilization of the measured tiling materials

range from 7 to 1209 nGy h−1, values that are decreased according to the fractional

utilization of the materials. In round terms and for full utilization, 23 of the samples

exhibit dose rates that range from 100 to 400 nGy h−1, two exhibit dose rates under the

typical limit of 100 nGy h−1 (“Nero Africa” with 7 nGy h−1 and “Astudo” with 43

nGy h−1) and only three of the samples exhibit values over the limit of 400 nGy h−1

(“Café Brown” with 1209 nGy h−1, “Rosso Balmoral” with 619 nGy h−1 and “New

Imperial” with 409 nGy h−1). A summary of this analysis is presented in Fig. 3, where

the frequency (in percent) of total absorbed dose rates for full utilization of the twenty-

eight measured samples is plotted.

The analytical results for the total absorbed dose rates in air for each of the measured

samples and for various fractional masses indicated are also given in Table 2. For

comparison, measurements in former Czechoslovakia, in houses with outside walls

containing uraniferous coal slag, gave values approaching 1,000 nGy h−1 (Thomas et al.,

1993), while measurements in a granite region of the United Kingdom, where some of

the houses are made of local stone, gave 100 nGy h−1 (Wrixon et al., 1988).

The relative contribution to total absorbed dose due to 232Th ranges from 1 % for sample

“Nero Africa” to 69 % for “Rosso Balmoral”, due to 238U ranges from 4 % for “Multi-

colour” to 30 % for “Café Brown” and due to 40K ranges from 7 % for “Café Brown” to

11

92 % for “Nero Africa”. The fractional contribution to total absorbed dose of the three

radionuclides, 232Th, 238U and 40K, is plotted in Fig. 4, for all the samples studied.

Finally, the annual effective doses indoors estimated, using a value of 0.7 Sv Gy−1 for

the conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to effective dose received by

adults, 0.8 for the indoor occupancy factor and 0.5 utilization of material, range from

0.02 mSv y−1 for sample “Nero Africa” to 2.97 mSv y−1 for “Café Brown”. It is clear

that, for full utilization of the materials, the associated effective dose rates would be by

a factor of two higher than those illustrated in Table 2 (wm = 0.5) and by a factor of two

lower for one quarter utilization of the samples. However,

the simple irradiation

geometry and rounded values considered do not allow this approach to be more than a

rough approximation.

4. Conclusions

Exploitation of high-resolution γ−ray spectroscopy provides a sensitive experimental

tool in studying natural radioactivity and determining elemental concentrations and dose

rates in various rock types. Most of the tiling rock samples studied in this work reveal

high values for the activity and elemental concentrations of thorium, uranium and

potassium, thus contributing to high absorbed dose rates in air. In general, the extracted

values are distinctly higher

than the corresponding population-weighted (world-

averaged) ones, and, in some cases (e.g. “Café Brown”, “Rosso Balmoral”, “New

Imperial” etc.), they lie outside the typical range variability of reported values from

world-wide areas due to terrestrial gamma radiation, given in the recent UNSCEAR

2000 Report.

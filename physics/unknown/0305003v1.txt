1 INTRODUCTION 

the 

The  HRIBF  [1]  has  been  successfully  conducting  a 
research program of nuclear structure physics [2], nuclear 
reaction  physics  [3],  and  nuclear  astrophysics  [4]  for 
several  years.    It  is  one  of  the  first-generation  Isotope 
Separation on Line (ISOL) RIB facilities.  At the HRIBF, 
the  target/ion  source  is  mounted  on  a  300-kV  rated 
  A  light-ion  beam  from  the  Oak  Ridge 
platform. 
Isochronous  Cyclotron  (ORIC)  bombards 
target 
producing  radioactive  nuclei  that  are  extracted  from  the 
ion  source  as  20-keV  singly  charged  positive  ions  and 
subsequently  accelerated  to  40  keV.    Negative  ions  are 
required for injection into the 25-MV tandem electrostatic 
accelerator.    Therefore,  after  first-stage  magnetic  mass 
separation,  the  40-keV  singly  charged  positive-ion  beam 
is  injected  into  a  recirculating  jet  cesium  vapor  charge-
exchange  cell.    The  energy  spread  of  the  resulting 
negative-ion  beam  is  several  tens  of  eV  for  an  injected 
positive  atomic  beam  and  several  hundreds  of  eV  for  an 
injected  positive  molecular  beam,  the  increase  being  due 
to  the  three-body  kinematics  of  molecular  breakup.    The 
negative-ion  beam  is  finally  accelerated  to  a  nominal 
energy  of  200  keV  and  sent  through  a  second  stage 
magnetic 
intrinsic  mass 
resolution  of  20,000  prior  to  injection  into  the  tandem 
accelerator. 
 

isobar  separator  with  an 

Unfortunately,  the  actual  mass  resolution  of  the  isobar 
separator  is  significantly  degraded  by  the  energy  spread 
due  to  positive  atomic  beams  and  essentially  eliminated 
by  the  energy  spread  due  to  positive  molecular  beams.  
This  is  a  serious  problem,  particularly  in  the  case  of  the 
high isobar contamination of RIBs that are produced from 
isobar 
fission  products. 

  Various  element  specific 

 

  
 

separation  techniques  are  available  [5],  but  magnetic 
isobar separation is applicable to a wide range of RIBs.  A 
multi-harmonic buncher and a 12-MHz RFQ is proposed 
here  to  supplement  the  existing  high  voltage  platform 
system.    Charge  exchange  would  be  performed  after 
isobar  separation  and  before  injection  into  the  RFQ, 
which, in turn, would inject into the tandem accelerator. 
 

A  negative-ion  beam  cooler  is  also  being  studied  at 
ORNL  to  reduce  both  the  longitudinal  and  transverse 
emittance of RIBs [6].  If successful, the cooler could be 
used with the 300-kV platform system when negative-ion 
sources are used and charge exchange is not required. 
           

2 LAYOUT OF INJECTION SYSTEM  

 

 

Fig.  1  shows  the  present  injection  system  for  the 
HRIBF.    Fig.  2  shows  the  proposed  injection  system  for 
the HRIBF consisting of a multi-harmonic buncher and a 
12 MHz RFQ.  In the new system, the RIB is transmitted 
to the isobar separator at 60 keV instead of 200 keV.  The 
charge-exchange cell has been moved downstream of the 
isobar  separator.    The  RFQ  is  mounted  on  a  ±100-kV 
platform  to  accelerate  ions  with  masses  from  10  to  150 
amu.  Due to severe space restrictions, both the diameter 
and  the  length  of  the  RFQ  are  limited  to  approximately 
one meter.  Consequently, there is no adiabatic bunching 
section,  which  would  result  in  an  RFQ  more  than  three 
meters  long.    A  multi-harmonic  buncher  that  is  designed 
to capture more than 80% of the injected DC beam can be 
located at ground potential within the available space.

of the bunched beams are less than the acceptance of the 
RFQ, this buncher design is satisfactory.

The  longitudinal  phase  space  for  a  20-amu  bunched 
beam and the longitudinal acceptance separatrix of the 12-
MHz RFQ are shown in Fig. 4.  The buncher can capture 
84%  of  the  DC  beam  for  injection  into  the  RFQ  in 
principle.  However, there is a 15% beam loss due to the 
buncher  grids  [8]  that  reduces  the  overall  efficiency  to 
approximately 70%.  This is less than that of an RFQ with 
an adiabatic bunching section, but still acceptable.

4 HEAVY ION RFQ 

A  12-MHz  heavy-ion  RFQ  with  overall  length  of  one 
meter  has  been  designed  using  the  code  PARMTEQ  [9].  
Fig.  5  shows  the  various  beam  profiles  at  the  exit  of  the 
RFQ with an injected 1-keV/amu 150-amu singly charged 
negative beam.  The normalized transverse acceptance of 
the  RFQ  is  0.6  π⋅mm⋅mrad.    The  maximum  required  RF 
input power is approximately 15 kW as with the Atlas 12 
MHz RFQ [10].  Because the RFQ has a narrow velocity 
acceptance, it must be mounted on a ±100-kV platform in 
order  to  accelerate  RIBs  from  10  to  150  amu.    The 
injection parameters for different ion masses are listed in 
Table 2. 
 

Various  existing  and  proposed  RFQs  utilize  split-
coaxial  [11,12],  ring-connected  [13],  split  ring  [14]  or 
four-rod  spiral  [15]  structures  to  achieve  low  resonate 
frequencies.  Since the proposed HRIBF RFQ has 94 cm 
electrodes, a split-coaxial structure would exceed the one-

In the RFQ injection system, the target/ion source is at 
60  kV,  and  the  first-stage  mass  separator  and  charge-
exchange  cell  are  now  at  ground  potential.    This  will 
enhance  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  proposed 
injection system.  Fig. 3 shows the beam envelopes from 
the image slit of the isobar separator to the entrance of the 
RFQ, calculated with the TRACE3D code [7].

3 MULTI-HARMONIC BUNCHER 

The  multi-harmonic  buncher  will  have  12,  24,  36,  and 
48  MHz  modes  with  relative  voltage  amplitudes  of  1.0, 
0.44,  0.23,  and  0.12,  respectively.    Since  the  beam  may 
have  several  hundred  eV  energy  spread  after  charge 
exchange,  the  buncher  should  be  as  close  as  possible  to 
the  RFQ  to  minimize  time  dispersion.    Mounting  the 
buncher  on  the  ±100-kV  platform  along  with  the  RFQ 
would  minimize  the  distance  between  the  two  at  the 
expense  of  requiring  more  RF  power  at  high  voltage.

spiral  structure  with  its  larger  end  capacitances  should 
reduce  the  tank  diameter  sufficiently.    Fig.  6  shows  the 
electrode structure of the RFQ.  Some design parameters 
for  the  HRIBF  RFQ  are  given  in  Table  3.    Further 
mechanical, thermal, and RF efficiency studies need to be 
conducted.

5 CONCLUSIONS 

 

 

A multi-harmonic buncher and 12-MHz heavy ion RFQ 
injection  system  can  allow  magnetic  isobar  separation 
prior to charge exchange of positive atomic and molecular 
RIBs at the HRIBF.  Isobar contamination of RIBs will be 
significantly reduced  with the proposed injection system.  
Operation  and  maintenance  of  the  target/ion  source  and 
other  devices  presently  mounted  on  the  300-kV  platform 
will be simplified.

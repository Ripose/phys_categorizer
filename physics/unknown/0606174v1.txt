Abstract 

Optical  plasmon-polariton  modes  confined 

in  both 

transverse 

dimensions  to  significantly  less  than  a  wavelength  are  exhibited  in 

open  waveguides  structured  as  sharp  metal  wedges.  The  analysis 

reveals  two  distinctive  modes  corresponding  to  a  localized  mode  on 

the  wedge  point  and  surface  mode  propagation  on  the  abruptly  bent 

interface.  These  predictions  are  accompanied  by  unique  field 

distributions  and  dispersion  and  offer  explanation  for  structural 

sensitivities previously reported in experiments and simulations.

1. Introduction 

Sub  wavelength  confinement  of  guided  waves  is  highly  advantageous  for 

downscaling  optical  components  to  the  nano-scale,  such  as  for  inter-chip 

optical  wiring  and  nano-systems  interconnects.  Here  for  the  first  time,  we 

present  a  complete  modal  analysis  of  a  metallic  waveguide  with  a  cross-

section  shaped  as  a  narrow  wedge,  exhibiting  modal  size  hundred  times 

smaller than the wavelength in each transverse dimension.   

Surface  Plasmon-Polariton  (SPP)  is  a  guided  wave  confined  in  1D  to  a 

sub-wavelength  cross-section, 

though 

infinite 

in 

the  other 

transverse 

dimension  [1].  Confinement  in  both  the  transverse  dimensions  is  achievable 

using  the  plasmonic  slow  waves  and  specific  topologies,  analogous  to 

“standard”  dielectric  waveguides  –  namely  metallic  nano-wires,  which  were 

discussed elsewhere [2]. However the surface guiding of SPP allows also for 

open  contour  topologies,  relaxing  the  waveguide  transversal  dimension 

constraint.  

While a metallic surface supports 1D confined SPP, a modification in the 

curvature  of  a  metallic  surface,  e.g.,  a  wedge  shaped  metallic  structure,  is 

expected to support Plasmon-Polariton confined in 2D. The enhanced field of 

the guided wave in the vicinity of the wedge tip may be employed to enhance 

nonlinear effects, or to be used as a highly sensitive sensor. Here we analyze 

the wedge waveguide in closed form to understand the role of parameters (e.g. 

wedge angle and dielectric constants), the dispersion relations and the modal 

confinement. 

Full  fledged  analytic  solutions  for  optical  modes  of  metallic  wedge 

waveguides  were  never  reported,  and  the  most  detailed  analysis  employed  a 

scalar wave-equation assuming electrostatic regime for sharp [3] and smooth 

[4]  topologies.  Although  simplifying  the  analysis,  this  eliminates  the  mere 

issue  of  the  full  vectorial  nature  of  the  hybrid  modes  and  their  structural 

dispersion  while  discarding  the  retardation  effects.  The  electrostatic  solution 

obtained in [3] is an asymptotical approximation to the one obtained here. 

Recently, 

localized  plasmons  propagating  on  metal  wedge  were 

demonstrated  using  FDTD  simulation  and  in  experiments  [5].  The  analysis 

presented here provides understanding of the structure of the modes and their 

parametric dependence,  among which offering an explanation for the critical 

wedge  angle  reported,  and  should  assist  in  enhanced  design  of  such  novel 

nano-waveguides. 

Worth  mentioning  is  a  related  complementary  problem  of  propagation 

along smooth channels carved in metal,  analyzed using  a modified moments 

method [6]. However, the basis set of the functions used there is not suitable 

for  sharp  wedge  configuration  and  thus  not  appropriate  for  the  problem  at 

hand.  Additionally,  resolving  the  field  profile  in  [6]  involves  a  tedious 

solution  of  a  set  of  integral  equations.  In  the  current  work  we  derive  closed 

form solutions for sharp-wedge cross-section metal waveguides,  exhibiting  a 

substantial field concentration near the wedge point and study the interesting 

dispersion  characteristics  of  the  guided  modes.  This  analysis  can  be  trivially 

enhanced  to  the  complementary  structures  of  v-grooves  in  metal,  recently 

studied via simulations and experimentally [7].   

2. Analysis of wedge plasmonic modes 

The  analysis  of  the  metal  wedge  waveguide  surrounded  by  a  dielectric  is 

performed in cylindrical coordinates system {r,θ,z} assuming indefinitely long 

wedge, both in the radial and axial directions, as shown in Fig. 1(a). Though 

actual wedges are finite, the plasmonic fields are located around the wedge tip, 

which validate this assumption.  

Since  plasmonic  modes  are  slow  waves,  they  exponentially  decay  into 

both air and metal, in the radial direction as well as azimuthally. Seeking for 

such characteristics, we examine the propagating modes which have negligible 

decay along the waveguide length. In cylindrical coordinate system the radial 

solutions  of  wave  equation  are  the  modified  Bessel  functions  of  the  second 

kind, denoted by K. Satisfying the boundary conditions at each interface point 

is impossible for a single Modified Bessel function for each medium, thus the 

solution is a series of K-functions. 

The order of the K-functions may be chosen as real or imaginary, i.e. set 

of  basis  function  of  the  form  ~Kv(qr)exp(ivθ)  or  ~Kiv(qr)exp(-vθ).  q  is  the 

radial momentum, and v denoted the K-function order. Taking the order to be 

imaginary is more suitable since it implies azimuthal hyperbolic dependence, 

rather  than  harmonic,  which  better  describes  the  azimuthal  decay  of  the 

plasmonic  solutions  away  from  the  interface.  Moreover,  the  {Kiv(qr)}v  is  a 

complete  set  (in  contrary  to  {Kv(qr)}v)  with  basis  functions  which  are 

consistent with the radiation condition and also being square integrable. 

Using  this  set  for  the  solution  at  each  media:  F(r,θ)=∑fv  Kiv(qr)exp(-vθ), 

the expansion coefficients, as a function of the order, fv, define the v-spectrum 

of  the  solution.  The  general  v-spectrum  is  continuous  on  the  indefinite 

interval,  [0,∞).  However  the  compactness  of  this  expansion  allows  for  a 

sufficient representation on a limited interval, [0,vmax]. As the order of a basis 

function is increased, the azimuthal decay is enhanced while the radial one is 

decreased.  The  confinement  of  the  plasmonic  fields  around  the  wedge  tip  is 

translated to effectively bounding the v-spectrum. This could be inferred also 

from  the  Kontorovich-Lebedev  transform  [8],  having  K-functions  with 

imaginary order as basis set.  

Truncating  the  v-spectrum  components  above  vmax  may  cause  errors 

mostly at the interfaces. Thus, constructing and testing the solution, according 

to  the  boundary  conditions,  on  the  interface  assures  of  the  solution  accuracy 

on the entire domain. 

3. Modal characteristics  

Applying the analysis described in the previous section, the symmetry permits 

for  two  sets  of  solutions:  odd  and  even  about  the  axis  of  symmetry  (θ=α). 

Solving the problem in terms of tangential field components (i.e. Ez and Hz), 

four independent boundary conditions apply for each r>0 on the interface θ=0:

Where  the  radial  momentum:  qD,M=(β2-k0

number, and ε is the relative dielectric constant. For Hz

o a,b,cosh are replaced 

by c,d,sinh in Eq. 2, v which denotes the K-function imaginary order, is real 

and continuous values. Since each of the basic field functions in both sides of 

the  interface  has  a  different  r-dependence,  the  boundary  conditions  for  all  r 

values dictate a superposition of wave solutions. This is a major complication 

absent in the electrostatic analysis, for which one assumes substantial β-values 

resulting with similar basis functions on both sides of interface (i.e. qM=qD).  

Approximating  the  v-spectrum  integral  as  N-sized  discrete  series, 

projecting the four boundary conditions onto the base function of the dielectric

Expressions for G and H functions are given at the Appendix. The solution of 

this  algebraic  equation  set  is  self-consistent  when  the  determinant  vanishes. 

This gives the exact dispersion relation of the guided modes and the field v-

spectrum, from which the field distribution is extracted using Eq. (2).  

 Typically  the  v-spectrum  peak  value  is  observed  around  v=0  and  v=3/α 

for  the  fields  in  the  dielectric  and  metal  respectively  and  the  spectrum  is 

vanishing  rapidly  with  v.  The  broadest  span  of  v-spectrum  is  required  for 

constructing  the  solution  on  interfaces,  due  to  the  enhanced  sensitivity  to 

higher  v–spectral  components,  which  reassures  the  solution  integrity  on  the 

entire domain.   

To elucidate the basic modal characteristics, the metal losses are neglected 

in  the  followings  in  respect  to  metal  dispersion,  as  is  commonly  done.  The 

complete calculation scheme supports fully the case of complex permittivity, 

namely complex εM and β. 

The  analysis  is  exemplified  for  a  36  degrees  gold  wedge  waveguide 

surrounded by  air. The  dispersion relations are  depicted in fig. 1(b), denoted 

by  two  bold  curves.  Both  dispersion  curves  are  reaching  asymptotically 

towards  the  single  surface  SPP  frequency  (ωSPP=(1+εD)-0.5)  as  β  tends  to 

infinity,  which  is  typical  for  plasmonic  waveguides.  The  single  surface  SPP 

dispersion  curve  is  superimposed  in  Fig.  1(b)  (dashed).  The  upper  branch 

(frequency-wise) exhibits negative group velocity, which vanishes for infinite 

β  values.  The  lower  dispersion  branch  is  divided  by  a  minimum  frequency 

point  (ωmin=0.69ωp)  into  negative  and  positive  group  velocity  intervals.  For 

each  frequency  above 

this  cutoff  frequency  (ωmin), 

in 

the 

interval 

(ωmin<ω<ωSPP), two propagation constants are simultaneously supported, with 

opposite  group  velocity  signs.  The  appearance  of  two  modes  at  the  same 

frequency  (for  the  same  symmetry)  emerges  also  in  other  plasmonic 

waveguides, under specific conditions, e.g. the metal slab [9].  

The  frequency  of  the  upper  branch  decreases  monotonically  with  β, 

accompanied  by  tighter  localization  around  the  wedge  point.  The  Ez  field 

component at pt. (I) is depicted in Fig. 2, and drops off symmetrically for all 

transverse  directions  –  into  the  metal  and  dielectric.  At  the  same  effective 

index  value, 

the 

lower  dispersion  branch  exhibits  different 

field 

characteristics,  as  demonstrated  at  Fig.  3.  Comparison  of  the  Ez  component 

reveals  that  a  main  lobe  is  still  localized  on  the  wedge  point  but  secondary 

lobes appear as well on the metal interfaces. Decreasing the modal frequency, 

the  number  of  side  lobes  as  well  as  the  respective  modal  cross  section 

increase.  The  distribution  of  the  pointing  vector  directed  along  z  (Sz)  at 

dispersion  points  I  and  II  are  depicted  in  Fig  4(a)  and  4(b),  accordingly.  It 

elucidates that although the power propagates predominantly in the dielectric, 

more  than  90%  of  the  mode's  intensity  and  power  (Sz)  are  guided  within  a 

cross section of 0.01% of free-space wavelength - well under the "diffraction 

limit".    In  Fig.  5  it  is  apparent  that  also  for  the  lower  branch  –  the  mode 

becomes more localized towards the wedge point as β is increased. 

The  distinct  characteristics  of  the  two  dispersion  branches  are  associated 

with  the  'dual  role'  that  the  wedge  plays.  The  one  dimensional  discontinuity 

formed  at  the  wedge  tip  serves  as  indefinitely  thin  plasmonic  waveguide 

"core". On the other hand, a metal wedge is comprised of two metal surfaces, 

each  serves  as  a  single  surface  SPP  mode  waveguide,  which  are  coupled  at 

their merging point. These two distinct modes of propagation supported by the 

wedge  configuration  are  manifested  by  the  two  dispersion  curves.  The 

propagation  associated  with  wedge  tip  1D  discontinuity  is  relegated  to  the 

upper  branch,  while  the  lower  curve  is  more  of  the  two  coupled  surface 

modes. 

  

 

Similarly  to  slab  modes,  the  field  associated  with  the  lower  curve 

(depicted  in  Fig.  3  for  pt.  II)  has  both  tangential  component  (Ez)  and 

component  normal  to  the  interface  (Eθ).  For  the  normal  component  the  two 

surface modes coupled at the tip are evident, being located on the interfaces. 

However,  the  dominant  component  (in  terms  of  maximal  field  amplitude)  is 

actually  Er,  which  is  the  transversal  parallel  component.  This  component, 

which  is  mainly  located  around  the  tip,  is  absent  for  slab  waveguide,  and 

emerges  from  the  hybrid  configuration.  Since  the  field  related  to  the  upper 

branch  is  mainly  guided  by  the  wedge  tip  (rather  than  the  wedge  faces)  its 

field components are exhibiting reduced azimuthal dependence, as illustrated 

in Fig. 2 for pt. I. 

This  narrative  elucidates  the  distinctive  shape  of  dispersion  curves.  For 

substantial values of β the significant structural details for the plasmon waves 

propagating at each point on an interface are the local neighborhood, resulting 

in  dispersion  curve  similar  to  that  of  a  single  surface  SPP.  However  SPPs 

localized on the two wedge facets are exceedingly coupled in the vicinity of 

the  wedge  point,  which  splits  the  dispersion  curve  according  to  the  mode 

symmetry.  For  Ez

e  the  dispersion  curve  is  pushed  to  lower  frequency  in 

respect to the single surface SPP curve. This symmetry, of even tangential E-

field,  is  related  to  the  odd  potential  mode  of  metal  slab  (equivalent  to  odd 

transversal H-field) [9]. For low β-values the localization notion is weakening, 

and  the  lower  branch  resembles  the  upper  one  for  extremely  low β-values. 

The  two  different  asymptotic  behaviors  of  the  lower  branch  results  in  the 

minimal frequency point on the dispersion curve at β=5k0.  

Comparing  with  the  electrostatic  analysis  [3],  the  upper  branch  could  be 

examined  for  high  values  of  β.  The  modal  frequency  of  the  electrostatic 

localized  mode  is  above  the  asymptotic  single  surface  SPP  frequency, 

decreasing  monotonically  with  β.  This  coincides  with  the  upper  dispersion 

branch  depicted  in  Fig  1(b),  related  to  the  mode  localized  on  the  1D 

discontinuity.  

Equipped  with  the  dispersion  characteristics,  sensitivity  to  structural 

parameters  can  be  studied.  As  the  dielectric  constant  surrounding  the  metal 

wedge increases, the dispersion curves are pulled down, as ωspp decreases. The 

cutoff  frequency  increases  with  the  wedge  angle,  as  the  lower  dispersion 

branch  diverges  less  from  the  single  surface  SPP  curve,  due  to  reduced 

coupling between the modes propagating near the wedge point. A cutoff angle 

is  expected  at  a  given  wavelength,  above  which  a  solution  does  not  exist.  A 

cutoff angle was observed in some specific FDTD simulations [5].  

4. Conclusion 

We  analyzed  in  detail  nano-scale  modes  propagating  on  a  metal  waveguide 

with a wedge cross-section. Two branches  are resolved, one is related to the 

wedge  point  localized  mode  (wire  like)  and  the  second  to  the  waves 

propagating on the interfaces crossing at the wedge point. This notion is used 

to  explain  the  curve  characteristics,  as  well  to  validate  with  previous 

asymptotic  studies  and  observations.  The  cross-section  of  the  modes  is  of  a 

substantial  sub-wavelength  dimension,  with  most  of  the  guided  power 

propagating  within  a  cross  section  with  each  dimension  ~  1%  of  the 

wavelength.

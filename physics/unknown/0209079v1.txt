Abstract 
 
Pyroelectric crystals are used to produce self-focused electron beams with energies greater than 170 keV. 
No  high  voltage  power  supply  or  electron  gun  is  needed.  The  system  works  by  simply  changing  the 
temperature of a crystal of LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 by about 100oC in dilute gas. Electron beam energy spectra 
as well as positive-ion-beam energy spectra and profiles are shown. A change in the crystal temperature of 
100oC will cause a spontaneous change in polarization. The change in polarization will be manifested by a 
change  in  charge  on  the  surface  of  the  crystal.  It  is  this  uncompensated  charge  that  produces  the  electric 
field,  which  accelerates  the  electrons,  or  the  positive  ions  and  gives  rise  to  the  plasma,  which  in  turn 
focuses  them.  The  source  of  the  accelerated  electrons  or  positive  ions  is  gas  molecules  ionized  near  the 
crystal  surface.  When  the  crystal  surface  is  negative  electrons  are  accelerated  away  from  it  and  positive 
ions are attracted to the surface.  These positive ions reduce the net negative charge on the surface thereby 
reducing  the  electric  field,  which  causes  the  electron  energy  to  decrease  over  time  even  though  the  focal 
properties remain unchanged.  When the surface is positive the reverse obtains and the positive ion beam 
energy  decreases  over  time  as  well.    We  will  present  video  clips,  photographic  and  electronic  data  that 
demonstrate many of the characteristics and applications of these electron beams. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
        Even  though  pyroelectric  crystals 
have  been  known  since  ancient  Greek 
times1,  surprising  new  effects  and 
practical  applications  are  constantly 
being  discovered  1-9. 
is  a 
electron 
literature 
voluminous 
emission 
crystals.  
Reference  10,  a  comprehensive  review 
article  and    (11-15)  are  representative 
but none of them suggests that energetic 
electron  beams  are  produced  by  such 
crystals.    Much  of  the  current  industrial 
use  of  these  crystals  is  in  infrared 
detection, sensitive temperature change  
 

 
 
detectors  and  photonics,  e.g., 
the 
detection  of  THz  radiation16  in  LiNbO3.  
For  these  reasons  few  studies  of  the 
behavior of these crystals in dilute gases 
have previously been done and so no one 
has 
the 
phenomena being reported on here.   
         The 
naturally 
occurring  pyroelectric  crystals  were 
kidney  stones  of lynx1.  All pyroelectric 
crystals  including  artificially  produced 
LiNbO3  and  LaTaO3  are  asymmetric 
crystals. 
  They  become  electrically 
charged on heating and cooling and give 
rise  to  electric  fields  at their surfaces of 
up  to  106  V/cm18.  The  opposite  side  of

  There 

known 

first 

by 

a  crystal  which  is  heated  from  its  +  z 
base  becomes  positively  charged  on 
heating  and  negatively  charged  on 
cooling.  This is due to the movement of 
Li+  and  Nb-  ions  relative  to  the oxygen 
lattice12.    If the crystal  is immersed in a 
dilute  gas  the  net  charge  on  the  crystal 
surface  at  any  time  will  depend  on  the 
gas  type  and  pressure  as  well  because 
when  the  surface  is  negative,  positive 
ions  from  the  gas  will  bombard  it  and 
when  the  surface  is  positive,  electrons 
from  the  ionized  gas  will  also  bombard 
it.  Crystal  x-ray  emission  occurs  on 
heating  and  target  x-ray  emission  on 
cooling when the -z base is exposed and 
light is produced both on heating and on 
cooling  in  the  plasma  adjacent  to  the 
crystal.  
         Chronologically,  JDB2  reported  on 
the production of characteristic x-rays by 
cesium  nitrate  crystals  in  1992.  Then  in 
1999  he  and  S.  Raboy  wrote  a 
comprehensive  paper3  describing  the  x-
ray emission  and  light production in the 
plasma    for  several  different    crystals 
and gases.  Also in 1999 Shafroth et. al. 
studied  the  time  dependence  of  x-ray 
emission4.    Further  they  studied  the 
effect  on  total  x-ray  yield  for  five 
different  gases  and  found  a  marked 
decrease  in  yield  for  O2  which  was  due 
to the production of ozone in the plasma.  
Also  in  1999  Shafroth  and  Brownridge 
reported  on 
the  use  of  pyroelectric 
crystals in the teaching of x-ray physics5. 
Then  in  2001  JDB  and  collaborators 
reported  on  the  production  of  energetic 
electrons  by  pyroelectric  crystals 
in 
dilute gases6.  They found that multiple, 
nearly 
energetic 
monoenergetic  electrons  were  produced 
on  cooling  these  crystals  when  the  -  z 
base  faced  the  detector.    Later  JDB  and 
others7  found  that  the  maximum  energy 
the  emitted  electrons  depended 
of 

(~100 

keV) 

somewhat  on  gas  type  but  strongly  on 
pressure.    Then  JDB  and  SMS  found8 
that  if  the  crystals  were  ground  to  a 
cylindrical  shape  that  focused  beams  of 
electrons  were  produced  as  the  crystal 
cooled  and  focused  beams  of  positive 
gas  ions  were  produced  as  the  crystal 
was heated.  Most recently, S. Bedair et. 
al.,  using  a  LabVIEW  program  have 
studied the effect of pressure on the time 
dependent  yield  of  crystal  x-rays  and 
target current9.

Focused Electron Beams  
 
       This report describes the production 
of  self-focusing  electron  beams  arising 
from near pyroelectric crystal surfaces in 
dilute  gases  after  the  crystal  has  been 
heated 
room 
temperature.  In one case a 5 mm diam x 
5  mm  cylindrical  LiNbO3  crystal  in  an 
atmosphere  of  <10  mtorr  of  dry  N2  was 
contained in a glass tube.

   The crystal was heated to about 115 0C 
and  then  allowed  to  cool  to  room 
temperature.    Heat  was  supplied  by 
passing  ~100 mA through a wire-wound 
60  ohm  resistor  which  was  epoxied  to 
the  crystal's  +  z  base.  After  cooling  to 
spatially-stable 
room 
electron  beams  were  produced.    They 
were  made  visible  by  placing  a  ZnS 
screen at the focal length (17 mm) of the 
crystal  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1(a),  which 
shows  a  photograph  of  the  ZnS  screen; 
the  cylindrical  crystal  and  the  60  ohm 
wire-wound  resistor  used  to  heat  the 
crystal.

pressure  on  the  beam.  Typical  results  at 
~0.5  mtorr  1(b),  ~3  mtorr  1(c)  and  ~8 
mtorr  1(d)  are  shown  in  Fig  1(b),  1(c), 
1(d)  respectively. 
the  pressure 
increased,  the  beam  spot  became  more 
diffuse  and  brighter.    At  ~8  mtorr  the 
beam  blew  up  and  its  intensity  dropped 
to zero.   The dynamical behavior of the 
electron  beam  with  pressure,  which  is 
illustrated  in  the  video  clip17  suggests  a 
gas-multiplication  effect.  The  focusing  
effect  may  be  due  to  plasma  focusing.  
All results reported on in this paper were 
repeated many times.

       Next  a  100  Î¼m  surface-barrier 
electron  detector  was  installed  in  place 
of the ZnS screen so that electron energy

dependent 
energy 
spectrum,  which  was  taken in "snapshot 
mode",  i.e.  over  an  interval  of    <60  s, 
typically,  exhibited  discrete  peaks  at

The electron beam energy (solid circles) is

 All  pulses  corresponding  to  electron

these  scans.    From  this  figure  it  can  be 
seen that the best focus is obtained 16.5 
mm crystal-to-slit distance. Fig. 6. shows 
electron beam scans taken 16 hours later.  
The focal length is still 16.5 mm. Fig. 7.

4  mm.    Also  shown  is  the  electron 
energy at each slit position.  The uniform

Time (minutes)

Fig. 8.  Electron beam energy as a function of 
time after the crystal has reached room 
temperature.  Note the nearly exponential decay 
of the beam energy. 
 
The  maximum  energy  electrons  (170 
keV)  were  produced  after  the  crystal 
temperature  had  dropped  to  ~30  0C.   
Independent proof that the electron beam 
energy was at least 80 keV (Au K edge) 
for  a  significant  time  was  confirmed  by 
irradiating  gold  and  observing  the  K  X-
rays2,3.      Gold  K  electrons  were  being 
ionized  thereby  producing  Au  K  X-rays 
as  long  as  the  incident  electron  energy 
was  greater  than  80  keV  i.e.  starting  as 
the  crystal  cools  from  160  0C  when  the 
increasing  electron  energy  reached  80 
keV  and  continuing  until  the  maximum 
energy  (170  keV)  is  reached  and  then 
until the electron energy falls to less than 
80  keV,  sometime  after  the  crystal  has 
reached room temperature. 
 
Phenomenological  Description 
These Processes 
 
       If  the  crystal  is  subjected  to  a  rapid 
temperature change the polarization will 
be manifested briefly by the presence of 
is 
an  electric  field  whose  strength 

of

surface 

charge 
at 

the  polarization  change 

the  surface  charge 
proportional 
density, which in turn is a function of the 
change  in  temperature  and  depends  on 
the ambient pressure.   When the crystal 
is in a reduced pressure environment and 
is  subjected  to  the  same  temperature 
change, 
is 
manifested  by  an  electric  field  that  lasts 
much longer; at a pressure of about 10-6 
torr,  it  takes  more than 30  hours  for the 
resulting 
be 
atm 
neutralized,  whereas 
neutralization is virtually instantaneous3.  
The  neutralization  of  the  electric  field 
produced  by  a  change  in  polarization  is 
due  to  bombardment  of  and  attachment 
to  the  surface  by  positive  ions.    To 
summarize,  as  long  as  the  net  surface 
charge  is  sufficiently  negative,  electrons 
are  accelerated  away  from  the  crystal  in 
a focused beam whose energy can be up 
to 170 keV after which the energy of the 
electrons  in  the  beam  decreases  nearly 
the

electrons  become  undetectable.  It

the  beam  becomes 
remarkable 
spatially  stable  once  the  crystal  has 
reached  room  temperature,  even  before 
in some cases.  
 
 
Positive Ion Beams 
 
that  singly  charged 
       We  believe 
positive  ion  beams  arising  from  the 
residual  gas  have  also  been  observed.  
For  practical  reasons  they  can  best  be 
studied  by  exposing  the  +  z  base  of  the 
crystal  and  taking  measurements  as  the 
crystal 
same 
phenomena can be observed on heating a 
crystal with its -z base exposed. Figure 9 
shows an energy spectrum obtained over 
a  period  of  35  s  with  a  crystal  of 
LiNbO3,  10  mm  x  4mm  dia  heated  to 
1700C after the crystal had

Fig. 10.  The N2+ ion beam count rate profile

the beam energy is unaffected by the slit being at

cooled  to  ~350C  .  Here  the  gas  was N2 
so  the  beam  was  presumably  N2+.    The 
main  component  of  the  beam  has  an 
energy  of  ~100  keV  but  there  are 
secondary  components  with  energies  of 
~34  and  ~62  keV,  which  we  don't 
understand. 
Figure  10  shows  the  N2+  ion 
 
beam  profile,  which  is  also  about  4mm 
when  the  crystal-to-slit  distance  is  23 

mm  (the  focal  length).    On  the  other 
hand the N2+ ion beam energy decreases 
by  about  5%  as  the  slit  passes  through 
the  focal  point  of  the  beam  as  indicated 
by the count rate increase.

conclusion 

Fig. 11.  Ion beam energies at different slit 
positions and at different crystal-to-slit distances.  
Note that the maximum ion beam energy 
decrease occurs at the crystal focal length, which 
is  23mm. 
 
Finally  Fig.  11  shows  results  of  a  study 
of  the  N2+  ion  beam  energy  vs  slit 
position for  three different crystal-to-slit 
distances.    In  this  case  the  pressure-
sensitive  energy-drop  at  23  mm  (the 
focal length) is nearly 10%.  
 
 
self-focused 
energetic (<170 keV) electron beams are 
produced by heating to 1600C cylindrical 
LiNbO3  crystals  with  the  -  z  base 
exposed  in  dilute  gases  at  2-8  mtorr  on 
cooling.    Conversely,  positive  gas-ion 
beams  are  produced  by  heating  LiNbO3 
crystals  when  the  +  z  base  is  exposed 
again on cooling.

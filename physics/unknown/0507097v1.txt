Abstract A method of measuring time intervals by a single observer proposed by Crowell3 
is extended to the more general case when the events separated by the time interval take place at 
two points characterized by the same y=y’ space coordinates. We show that time dilation and time 
contraction can take place or even an inversion in the time succession can be detected. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Weinstein1  shows  how  a  single  observer  could  measure  the  length  of  a  moving  rod  by 
 
simultaneously detecting the light signals that have left the two ends of the rod at different times. 
He considers only the case in which the observer is very close to the rod. Mathews2 presents the 
same problem in the general case and  stresses that because the light signals  arise from different 
distances  to  from  the  observer,  the  measured  length  of  the  rod  will  be  very  different  from  that 
given by the Lorentz contraction. He considers that the measurement procedure is associated with 
the Doppler Effect as well. We show that the involved observers are concerned with the Doppler 
Effect only in the case when the frequency and the light source-observer distance are very high. 
Crowell3 shows that this argument can be applied to the observation of a time interval by a 
 
single observer. He considers the same simple case as Weinstein1 did. The purpose of our paper is 
to generalize the approach proposed by Crowell3.
 

 
2. Photographing a time interval 
 
Consider the scenario presented in Figure 1. It involves a rod of proper length L0 at rest in 
the K’(X’O’Y’) reference frame, parallel to the O’X’ axis. The space coordinates of its edges are 
, using both Cartesian and polar 

 and 2’

 

coordinates. At a time t’=0, an observer 

(the photographer in K’) located at the origin O’ 

receives the light signal that has left edge 1’ at a time 

and the light signal that has left 

edge  2’  at  a  time

.  The  time 

  is  displayed  by  a  clock

,  whereas  a  clock 

displays  the  time

.  All  the  clocks  of  the  K’(X’O’Y’)  reference  frame  are 
synchronized  following  the  clock  synchronization  procedure  proposed  by  Einstein4.  The  events 
 and 
associated with the fact that the light signals have left the edges of the rod are 

respectively. From Figure 1 we obtain

in that case 

 the light signals originating from 1’ and 2’ respectively propagate along the 

line  that  joins  the  two  events.  As  involving  physical  quantities  measured  in  the  same  inertial 
reference frame, the derivation of (4) involves special relativity by the constancy of the velocity of 
light postulate.  
Consider the experiment described above from the K(XOY) reference frame. The axes of 
 
the two reference frames are parallel to each other, the OX(O’X’) axes are common and K’ moves 
with  constant  velocity  V  relative  to  K  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  overlapped  axes.  At  the 
origin of time in the two reference frames (t=t’=0) the origins of the two frames are located at the 
same point in space.

An inspection of (9) shows that the time interval measured in the K reference frame is the result of 
a “dilation” of the time interval T’ measured in the stationary reference frame K’ and of an extra 
term determined by the fact that the two events take place in K’ at different points in space. 
We can express (9) as a function of the angle  measured in K, given by6

All  other  cases  studied  above  have  nothing  in  common  with  the

3. Conclusions 
If the time dilation effect in its common use is the result of a comparison between a proper 
time  interval  measured  in  the  rest  frame  of  one  of  the  clocks  involved  and  a  non-proper  time 
interval  measured  in  a  reference  frame  relative  to  which  the  clock  moves,  the  time  dilation  and 
time  contraction  effects  revealed  above  are  the  result  of  the  two  relativistic  effects  mentioned 
above.  In  order  to  avoid  confusion  it  is  advisable,  when  we  speak  about  the  magnitude  of  a 
physical quantity, to mention the observer (observers) who measure it, the measuring devices used 
and when and where he (they) performs the measurement.

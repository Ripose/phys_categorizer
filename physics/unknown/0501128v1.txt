ABSTRACT Early surface measurements of atmospheric Potential Gradient were made in many European cities in 
the  nineteenth  century  (C19th).  The  data  was  usually  obtained  at  hourly  resolution,  and  good  accounts  of  the 
calibration  of  the  instruments  are  also  often  available.  The  PG  measurements  made  by  Chauveau  on  the  Eiffel 
Tower, soon after its completion in the 1890s, are particularly notable. Atmospheric electrical proxy techniques in 
combination  with  simple  boundary  layer  meteorology  are  used  to  determine  air  pollution  levels.  The  C19th  PG 
measurements  in  both  polluted  and  clean  Parisian  air  present  a  unique  resource  for  European  air  pollution  and 
atmospheric composition studies. 
 
INTRODUCTION 

Measurements of the Potential Gradient (PG) have been made over a long period, mostly at the surface and 
frequently in urban centres. Aerosol pollution reduces the electric conductivity of atmospheric air, and increases the 
PG. In air in which the PG variations are dominated by aerosol variations, the well-established relationship between 
PG and aerosol permits the PG to be used as a proxy from which the aerosol variations have been inferred [Harrison 
and Aplin, 2002] near London for 1862-1864. Historical atmospheric electrical data from Paris is considered here, 
from  which  smoke  pollution  in  the  C19th  is  estimated  using  a  similar  technique.  Reconstruction  of  past  urban 
pollution is one aspect of understanding changes in atmospheric composition arising from anthropogenic activity. 

Hourly observations were made in Paris in the C19th, both at the Bureau Central Meteorologique and, in 
1893 at the top of the Eiffel Tower (ET) [Chauveau, 1925]. The measurements of potential were made using a fibre 
electrometer, and are thoroughly described in Chauveau [1925]. The ET measurements were made in summer and 
autumn, and, as for the surface measurements, were presented as absolute values. 
 
DAILY VARIATIONS 

The diurnal variation in PG in clean oceanic air is has been established to follow a unitary variation, with a 
maximum at 19UT and a minimum at 03UT. This global atmospheric electrical diurnal variation was identified in 
data obtained on voyages of the geophysical research vessel, Carnegie, between 1915 and 1929, and a similar form 
has been found in clean air throughout the C20th. Hourly PG data from polluted cities shows a very different diurnal 
variation, frequently with an additional maximum in the morning. At Kew, two daily maxima were recorded through 
the period of measurements from 1898-1931 [Scrase, 1934]. A small change in the phase of the maxima after the 
introduction of summer time in 1915 [Scrase, 1934], established that the changes were of local origin. Direct smoke 
pollution  measurements  subsequently  begun  at  the  same  site  showed  a  diurnal  variation  with  a  similar  double 
maximum behaviour. Such variations are a typical signature of polluted air, as they show when sources of particles 
are usually at their greatest, either from vehicular sources, or, before the advent of motor traffic, domestic heating. 
The  close  similarity  between  PG  and  simultaneous  direct  smoke  measurements  at  Kew  permits  a  semi-empirical 
calibration [Harrison and Aplin, 2002]. 

Figure 1 shows the daily variation in PG measured by Chauveau in 1893. The surface measurements show a 
double maximum behaviour. At the top of the ET (324m high), the PG shows only a single maximum. (The PG at 
the top of the ET is much greater than the surface value, because the tower is an earthed structure.) The amplitude of 
the maximum to minimum variation is, however 43%, which is greater than the typical Carnegie variation, indicating 
that  the  diurnal  variation  results  from  a  combination  of  global  and  local  effects.  Local  perturbations  at  both  the 
measurement sites are very likely to be caused by smoke from pollution.

The ET electrical 
data  present  a  unique  set 
of  measurements 
from 
which  daily  variations  in 
C19th  Parisian 
smoke 
pollution  can  be  studied. 
An understanding of other local factors is, however, also required. During the day, the urban boundary layer (BL) 
varies in depth. The nocturnal BL is shallower than the height of the tower, and the growing daytime convective BL 
engulfs the tower as it grows [Dupont et al, 1999]. There are therefore two different regions of air from to which the 
summit  of  the  ET  is  exposed,  free  tropospheric  air  and  urban  BL  air.  Making  the  assumption  that  the  free 
tropospheric air is clean, the electrical variations can be expected to be dominated by global atmospheric electrical 
changes,  as  given  by  the  Carnegie  curve.  The  variations  found  at  other  times  result  from  the  additional  effect  of 
smoke pollution. A BL model is used to estimate the typical diurnal variation in BL height, compared with direct 
data obtained recently [Dupont et al, 1999]. Based on this model, the C19th ET measurements likely to have been 
obtained in free tropospheric and BL air are treated separately. 
 
BOUNDARY LAYER MODEL DESCRIPTION

Carson's [1973] parameterisation for growth of the daytime BL from convective turbulence has been used. 
This approach assumes that a stable temperature gradient γ arises from nocturnal cooling, and the BL begins to grow 
to a height H as soon as the sun rises. The height of the daytime BL is proportional to the total heating received by 
the BL Sg and is given by:

where ρ is the density of air, Cp the heat capacity of air at constant pressure, t time in seconds and A an empirical 
dimensionless  constant  (0.01).  The  total  heating  was  calculated  by  estimating  the  direct  solar  radiation  for  Paris 
(48.7ºN, 2.4ºE) using the method described in Aplin and Harrison [2002] for a typical equinoctal day length of 12 

hours. The rate of growth of the nocturnal BL dH/dt is given by Garratt [1994] as

values  of  the  von  Karman  constant κ=0.4,  friction  velocity  u*=0.1  ms-1,  and  the  length  scale  of  turbulence  L=2m 
were used to estimate a growth rate of 12 m hr-1. Modern measurements of the BL height made over four days in 
March [Dupont et al, 1999] were used to constrain the model estimates. Carson’s [1973] simple model assumes that 
the BL continues to grow until sunset, which is inconsistent with observations showing that the BL decayed from 
~1600UT. An empirical linear scaling for the transition into the nocturnal BL was determined from the rate of decay 
of the daytime BL observed by Dupont et al [1999]. This determines the BL height until 04UT, when the growth of 
the nocturnal BL exceeds the decaying convective BL.

During the 00-09UT period when the ET is in the free troposphere, it is assumed that the ET variations are 
from the clean air Carnegie variation. It is possible to use the relationship between the Carnegie variation and the ET 
PG  for  these  times  to  calibrate  the  ET  PG  to  standard  surface  oceanic  values.  The  Carnegie  values  used  are  the 
annual  values  [Israel,  1970]  and  not  seasonally  adjusted.  Minima  were  fitted  to  estimate  Parisian  local  time  as 
equivalent  to  UT+1,  as  it  is  today.  A  linear  regression  between  the  relative  variation  in  ET  PG  and  the  absolute 
Carnegie  PG  values  (C),  for  the  times  when  the  ET  is  in  the  free  troposphere,  was  used  to  estimate  the  ET  PG, 
corrected for the height of the grounded tower. The regression equation is

Figure 3 shows the PG at the top of the ET, calculated from (2). The ET PG shows an afternoon peak a few 
hours before the classical Carnegie maximum, but declines at the same rate as the Carnegie PG in the evening. The 
PG for the times when the top of the ET is in the free troposphere closely matches the Carnegie variation. A polluted 
atmosphere  is  expected  to  show  a  larger  PG  than  that  from  the  Carnegie  variation.  The  early  evening  ET  PG 
onwards is similar in shape to the Carnegie PG, but it is unclear whether the data from 1800 is dominated by local or 
global effects. However, the excess in ET PG compared to the Carnegie from 09-17UT, when the ET is within the 
polluted BL, is very likely to be due to smoke pollution.

The sensitivity of the PG to smoke was found at Kew in the early twentieth century by Harrison and Aplin 
[2002],  and  similar  combustion  product  sizes  are  assumed  for  nineteenth  century  Paris.  The  excess  of  the  ET  PG 
over  the  Carnegie  PG  was  used  to  find  the  smoke  pollution  levels  for  09-17UT.  Surface  electrical  measurements 
made  at  the  Bureau  Central  Meteorologique  were  calibrated  in  the  same  way,  using  the  morning  PG  maximum, 
which can only have arisen from local effects. 

On  this  basis,  the  morning  maximum  Paris  surface  pollution  is  37±10µgm-3,  much  lower  than  the  Kew 
value of 170±50µgm-3 calculated by Harrison and Aplin [2002]. The midday smoke concentration at the top of the 
ET  is  still  lower,  20±80  µgm-3.  The  errors  in  calculating  the  smoke  concentration  above  the  surface  are  greater 
because two regressions are used, firstly to calibrate the absolute value of PG, and secondly to calibrate smoke to 
PG, with cumulative errors. As air within the convective BL is usually well-mixed, the pollution at the top of the ET 
is comparable with that at the top of the BL from 09-17UT. On this assumption, it is also possible to infer a profile 
of pollution based on the BL height, from 09-17UT, Figure 4.

DISCUSSION 

75

100

The mean smoke 
pollution  in  1893  Paris  is 
substantially  lower  than 
for  Kew 
the 
(London) in 1863, and the  
Parisian 
not 
PG 
dominated  by  smoke  to 
the same extent. However 
the  C19th  Parisian  PG 
variation has a significant 
local  component,  both  at  the  surface  and  aloft.  This  work  also  illustrates  that  the  presence  of  a  unimodal  PG 
variation  is  a  necessary,  but  not  sufficient  criterion  from  which  to  conclude  that  measurements  are  globally 
representative.

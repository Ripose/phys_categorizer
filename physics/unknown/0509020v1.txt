Abstract 

As  a  model  of  market  price,  we  introduce  a  new  type  of  random  walk  in  a  moving 

potential  which  is  approximated  by  a  quadratic  function  with  its  center  given  by  the 

moving average of its own trace. The properties of resulting random walks are similar to 

those  of  ordinary  random  walks  for  large  time  scales;  however,  their  short  time 

properties are approximated by abnormal diffusion with non-trivial exponents. A new 

data  analysis  method  based  on  this  model  enables  us  to  observe  temporal  changes  of 

potential forces from high precision market data directly.

      In the late 18th century, Adam Smith applied the physics concept of force to market 

and  introduced  the  concept  of  forces  of  demand  and  supply  in  economics,  or  "the 

invisible hands1." This classical mechanics model of market has been the standard base 

of modern economics; however, it is less known that the price dynamics has never been 

confirmed scientifically by real market data.   

          About 100 years ago Bachelier introduced a random walk model of market price2 a 

little before the Einstein's famous paper on Brownian motion. It took nearly 70 years 

until  his  idea  underwent  a  revaluation  by  the  name  of  financial  technology.  In  the 

formulation  of  financial  technology  the  motion  of  market  price  is  assumed  to  be  a 

random  walk  without  any  market  force.  Although  financial  technology  is  now  widely 

used in practical financial world, scientific validation is insufficient and deviations from 

real market data are pointed out3,4.   

          Econophysics is a new frontier of science that is aimed to reconstruct economics by 

orthodox methodology of physics based on objective data analysis. Owing to the recent 

development of computer technology huge amount of detail market data are now stored 

and a lot of new empirical findings are established, such as power law distribution of 

price changes, long time volatility correlations and short time abnormal diffusions5,6,7.   

          In this paper we introduce a new market price model that is a random walk in a 

moving  and  deforming  potential  function.  The  center  of  the  potential  is  given  by  a 

 

2

moving average of the walker's traces. Based on this model we can observe the change of 

potential function directly from market time series. The market data we analyze here is 

the high-precision data in yen-dollar exchange market consisted of about 13 million bid 

prices in the period of 1995-2002. 

          The  first  step  of  our  analysis  is  to  introduce  the  optimal  moving  average  that 

makes it possible to separate an independent noise from the raw data. For given time 

series of Yen-Dollar rate data, {

}, the moving average is defined as   

( )p t

  for T  =  1  to  1000  ticks, 

where the bracket denotes the average over t, and time is measured by a pseudo-time 

called  the  “tick  time,”  that  is  the  count  of  transaction  numbers8.  In  general  the 

estimated  weights  {

}  for  the  Yen-Dollar  rates  are  roughly  approximated  by  an 

kw

exponential function 

kw ∝

k
 exp( 0. 3  )
−

, namely, the characteristic decay time is about 3 

ticks which corresponds to around 30 seconds in real time on average.   

          For the motion of this moving average we assume the existence of a kind of linear 

central  force  with  its  center  given  by  another  moving  average  which  we  call  as  “the 

 

3

super moving average.” This operation is defined by a simple moving average of past M 

ticks of the optimal moving average as follows:.

Fig.1 shows an example of plots of raw market data, the optimal moving average and 

the super moving average. The value of M    is typically from 8 to 64. 

          The next step is to estimate the potential force by plotting the time difference of 

optimal moving average, 

P t
(

+ −

P

( )

, versus the price difference between the optimal 

moving average and the super moving average at time t, 

P t
( )

−

P t
( )M

. If there is no force 

acting  on  the  market  as  anticipated  in  financial  technology,  the  plots  should  scatter 

around the horizontal axis. However, we can generally find non-trivial slope by this plot 

as typically shown in Fig.2 and the slope is proportional to the strength of the market 

force. In order to observe this force we use 2000 data points. 

          As  this  force  can  be  regarded  as  a  central  force,  we  can  calculate  the  potential 

function  by  integrating  the  force  along  the  horizontal  axis  in  the  preceding  figure. 

Fig.3(a) shows the examples of potential functions estimated for different values of M. 

The curvature or the strength of force is stronger for smaller M, and this M-dependence 

can be scaled by a factor 

1/(

1)M −

  and all curves collapse into one curve as shown in 

Fig.3(b).  Thus,  the  dynamics  of  the  optimal  moving  average  derived  from  the  data  is 

given by the following equation including the effect of random motion that scatters the

Here, 

( )F t

  is the residual term that is approximated by an independent random noise, 

and the coefficient 

( )b t

  is estimated from the data independent of the bin size M of the 

super moving average.   

          When 

( )b t

  is positive the potential force attracts the optimal market price to the 

super  moving  averaged  price,  so  the  diffusion  is  slower  than  the  case  of  no  potential 

force. This tendency is confirmed by a numerical simulation of Eq.(4) with a constant 

b-value  and  independent  random  noise 

.  Fig.4  (the  bottom  bold  line)  shows  the 

( )F t

time evolution of the mean deviation

  in log-log scale. For 

time  scale  shorter  than  100  ticks,  the  diffusion  can  be  characterized  by  a  fractional 

power law consistent with the results of abnormal diffusion studies

However,  for  long  time  scale  this  abnormal  diffusion  property  vanishes  and  the 

exponent of this random walk converges to that of a normal diffusion, 

0.5α=

, namely, 

we have the following relation,

where 

bσ   is a time constant determined for each b-value. 

          In the case of negative 

( )b t

  the potential force expels 

( )P t

  from 

( )MP t

, and the 

 

5

resulting diffusion is faster than the normal diffusion as shown in Fig.4 (the top bold 

line).  For  short  time  scale,  the  abnormal  diffusion  characteristics  can  also  be 

approximated  by  a  non-trivial  fractional  relation  Eq.(5),  and  its  long  time  property  is 

well approximated by a normal diffusion, Eq.(6). 

            The functional form of 

bσ   is estimated both numerically and analytically10 to be 

given by the following equation for the range,  2 b

− < <   (see Fig.5).

As the diffusion constant D is defined by 

  for large t, the b-dependence of D is 

tσ

given by the square of Eq.(7). It should be noted that Eq.(7) diverges at 

b = −

2

. This 

result  implies  that  in  the  case  where 

b ≤ −   the  potential  force  term  in  Eq.(4) 

2

dominates the random noise term 

  and we will have a monotonic dynamical price 

( )F t

change in large time scale independent of the magnitude of the noise term. 

          The above theoretical results, from Eq.(5) to Eq.(7), are valid only for fixed value of 

( )b t

,  however,  the  observed  value  of 

  fluctuates  in  various  time  scales.  Fig.6(a) 

( )b t

shows  an  example  of  Yen-Dollar  rate  fluctuation  and  Fig.6(b)  gives  corresponding 

fluctuation  of 

( )b t

.  It  is  confirmed  that  for  the  period  of  positive 

( )b t

  the  market 

fluctuation  is  actually  stable,  and  for  negative  value  of 

( )b t

the  market  fluctuates 

largely.   

          The observed autocorrelation function of 

  has the following long tail of power

As  the  fluctuation  of 

( )b t

  is  much  slower  than  that  of  market  rates,  the  abnormal 

diffusion  properties  for  short  time  scale  can  be  confirmed  from  the  data  as  shown  in 

Fig.7(a) and 7(b). 

          The  model  equation,  Eq.(4),  provides  an  excellent  numerical  simulation  tool  for 

markets. We compare direct observation of market data and a numerical simulation as 

for the distribution of exchange rate changes. In this simulation we apply the observed 

value  of  {

( )b t

}  and  numerically  created  independent  noise  for  {

( )F t

}.  As  shown  in 

Fig.(8) the power law in the distribution is well re-produced by this simulation. Other 

basic  properties  can  also  be  checked  in  a  similar  way

10.  From  these  results  we  can 

conclude that the time series of {

} contain the most important information about the 

( )b t

market. 

          In  this  paper  we  succeeded  in confirming  the  existence  of  market  forces  directly 

from the market time series by applying our new method named PUCK (Potentials of 

Unbalanced  Complex  Kinetics)  analysis.  There  are  two  reasons  why  this  type  of 

attempts of observing market forces had been defeated so far. One reason is the amount 

and  quality  of  data.  We  need  about  500  to  2000  data  points  to  estimate  one  value  of 

( )b t

  while its value changes even in a day from positive to negative. Namely, we need 

 

7

thousands of data points in a day, so the data interval must be shorter than a minute. 

This level of high frequency market data became available only in recent years.   

          The  other  reason  is  the  lack  of  mathematical  model.  As  we  demonstrated,  the 

underlying potential function is moving with its center given by the moving average of 

its own traces. Although there are huge amount of works on random walks in potential 

functions  in  the  study  of  Ulenbeck-Ornstein  process11,  there  was  no  mathematical 

model  in  which  the  potential  function  moves  according  to  its  own  traces.  In  actual 

markets  the  potential  function  is  considered  to  be  formed  by  the  mass-psychology  of 

dealers, so the position and strength of potential function should change in rather short 

time  scale  as  dealers  are  generally  believed  to  be  quite  sensitive  to  all  kinds  of 

information flows.   

          One  of  the  most  meaningful  results  in  this  paper  is  the  existence  of  repulsive 

forces found in the market. This type of force has never been predicted so far, however, 

we believe that such unstable potential force is the key concept for understanding the 

whole  behaviors  of  markets.  We  have  a  conjecture  that  the  breakdown  of  diffusive 

motion for 

b t ≤ −

( )

2

  is related deeply to extraordinary market motions such as crashes, 

bubbles  and  hyper-inflations.  This  direction  of  study  is  now  developed  by  our  group 

intensively. 

          The method developed in this paper can be applied to any time sequential data. 

 

8

We expect that potential functions can also be detected in apparently random data in 

various fields of science by applying the PUCK analysis.

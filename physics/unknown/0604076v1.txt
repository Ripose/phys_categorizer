Abstract :   We used the Transfer-Integral method to compute, with an uncertainty smaller 

than  5%,  the  six  fundamental  characteristic  exponents  of  two  dynamical  models  for  DNA 

thermal denaturation and investigate the validity of the scaling laws. Doubts concerning this 

point  arise  because  the  investigated  systems  (i)  have  a  divergent  internal  length,  (ii)  are 

described  by  a  divergent  order  parameter,  (iii)  are  of  dimension  1.  We  found  that  the 

assumption that the free energy can be described by a single homogeneous function is robust, 

despite the divergence of the order parameter, so that  Rushbrooke’s  and  Widom’s  identities 

are  valid  relations.  Josephson’s  identity  is  instead  not  satisfied.  This  is  probably  due  to  the 

divergence of the internal length, which invalidates the assumption that the correlation length 

is solely responsible for singular contributions to thermodynamic quantities. Fisher’s identity 

is  even  wronger.  We  showed  that  this  is  due  to  the 

1=d

  dimensionality  and  obtained  an 

alternative law, which is well satisfied at DNA thermal denaturation.

I - Introduction 

It  has  long  been  recognized  that  there  are  marked  similarities  between  the  phase 

transitions  of  very  different  systems  :  antiferromagnets,  liquids,  superconductors  and 

ferroelectrics, to quote some of them, indeed all display a rather simple behavior in the region 

close  to  the  critical  point.  A  partial  explanation  comes  from  Landau's  theory  [1]  and 

equivalent  ones,  like  Van  der  Waals'  equation  for  liquids,  Weiss'  molecular  field  theory  for 

ferromagnets, Ornstein-Zernike equations,  random phase approximations [2],  and  Ginzburg-

Landau's equations for superconductors [3]. By supposing that the transition can be described 

by a so-called order parameter [2] and that the free energy can be expanded in power series in 

this  parameter  and  the  temperature  gap 

Tc −   (where 

T

cT

  is  the  critical  temperature),  these 

theories predict that most quantities (like the specific heat, the order parameter, the isothermal 

susceptibility, the correlation length and the correlation functions) display power laws in the 

neighborhood of the phase transition. Experiments done on many systems confirm the power 

laws  predicted  by  Landau,  but  show  that  real  critical  exponents  differ  markedly  from  those 

predicted  by  the  theory  [4].  These  experiments  furthermore  suggest  that  the  various  critical 

exponents  are  not  independent  but  obey  instead  certain  constraints.  Phenomenological 

scenarii,  which  explain  these  observations,  were  proposed  by  Widom  [5,6],  Fisher  [7-9], 

Kadanoff  [4,10]  and  Domb  and  Hunter  [11].  Based  on  the  assumption  that  the  free  energy 

and/or the correlation length are homogeneous functions, these theories lead to the conclusion 

that all critical exponents can be expressed in terms of only two of them, thanks to so-called 

scaling laws. Later, a method known as the Renormalization Group theory, which is based on 

Wilson's  idea  that  the  critical  point  can  be  mapped  onto  a  fixed  point  of  a  suitably  chosen 

transformation of the system's Hamiltonian [12,13], has provided a conceptual framework for 

understanding scaling.

Yet, as far as we know, all the systems for which the validity of the scaling laws has 

been checked have two properties in common : (i) their phase transition is describable by a 

finite order parameter, and (ii) these systems do not dissociate at the critical temperature. The 

fact that the order parameter remains finite is essential for most theories, which assume that 

the free energy can be expanded in power series with respect to the order parameter and the 

temperature  gap 

Tc − .  Obviously,  this  assumption  no  longer  holds  when  the  order 

T

parameter diverges at the critical point. Another central assumption of scaling theories is that 

the  correlation  length  is  solely  responsible  for  singular  contributions  to  extensive 

thermodynamic quantities. While this is certainly a reasonable assumption for bound systems, 

this might not be the case for dissociating ones. Indeed, a system that dissociates at the critical 

temperature  possesses  at  least  one  physical  internal  length  which  increases  infinitely  at  the 

critical  point  and  might  therefore  contribute  significantly  to  extensive  thermodynamic 

quantities. 

 

Whether the scaling laws are valid or not for systems with divergent order parameter 

and/or internal length is therefore an  open question. The  purpose  of this paper  is to address 

this question through the calculation of the characteristic exponents of two realistic dynamical 

models for DNA denaturation. This phase transition, which takes place when DNA solutions 

are heated, corresponds to the separation of the two DNA strands, that is, to the dissociation 

of the entangled polymers. Moreover, if the external stress depends explicitly on the distance 

between  paired  bases,  then  the  corresponding  order  parameter  diverges  at  the  critical  point. 

DNA denaturation models are therefore particularly well suited to investigate the applicability 

of the scaling laws to such unusual systems. 

The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  The  two  dynamical  models  for 

DNA denaturation are briefly described in section II. The technique we used to compute the 

characteristic exponents is the Transfer-Integral (TI) method. The details of the calculations 

 

3 

are  sketched  in  section  III.  Finally,  the  applicability  of  the  scaling  laws  to  systems  with 

divergent order parameter and/or internal length is discussed in section IV on the basis of the 

critical exponents that were obtained for the two models.

-1,  K=0.06  eV  Å-2,  α=0.35  Å-1  and  ρ=1.  Thanks  to  the  non-linear  stacking  interaction 

(

0>ρ

),  this  model  displays  a  much  sharper  transition  at  denaturation  and  is  thus  in  better 

agreement with experiment than the older models on which it is based [18-20]. 

 

The  second  model  for  DNA  denaturation  was  proposed  by  ourselves  (JB)  [21,22]  to 

take  into  account  the  fact  that  stacking  interactions  are  necessarily  finite.  For  homogeneous

this  model  the  site-specific  stacking  enthalpies 

HΔ   deduced  from  thermodynamic 

calculations  [23],  to  reproduce  the  multi-step  denaturation  process  that  is  experimentally 

observed for inhomogeneous DNA sequences. 

III - Tranfer-integral (TI) calculations 

The transfer-integral (TI) method (see for example Ref. [24] for a general description 

and  Ref.  [25]  for  a  discussion  regarding  the  applicability  of  the  method  to  systems  with 

unbound on-site potentials) consists in finding the eigenvalues 

kλ  and eigenvectors

symmetric TI operator, which satisfy

Note,  that  the  derivative  in  the  expression  for

dm /

dh

  (see

section IV), were computed from finite differences rather than from the complex expressions 

in Appendix B of Ref. [24]. 

 

The  characteristic  exponents  were  estimated  by  drawing  log-log  plots  of  the  various 

quantities  in  Eq.  (III.3)  and  measuring  the  slopes  in  the  regions  where  power  laws  are 

satisfied. For obvious physical reasons, these regions do not extend far from the critical point. 

Unfortunately, numerical considerations also forbid the observation of these regions too close 

from the critical point. Indeed, an infinite range of y values would be needed to numerically 
converge  the  quantities  in  Eq.  (III.3)  at  the  critical  point.  Since  the  dimension  of  the  {

}ijM  

matrix  is  necessarily  finite,  numerical  results  can  be  accurate  only  up  to  a  certain  distance 

from it. Consequently, large grids of points extending to large values of y are mandatory for 

the  interval  on  which  power  laws  are  observed  to  be  broad  enough  to  allow  a  precise 

estimation of the characteristic exponents. This point is absolutely crucial. For example, some 

of the characteristic exponents for the DPB model have already been reported [16]. However, 

the  authors  note  that  several  quantities  “diverge  smoothly”  at  the  transition,  because  of 

“transients which mask the leading-order asymptotics”. As a consequence, they only provide 

rough estimates for the exponents, which sometimes differ by a factor 2 from exact values. In 

the  light  of  our  calculations,  it  appears  that  the  so-called  transients  actually  result  from  the 

numerical limitation mentioned above. In order to achieve better precision, we used grids of 

4200 

iu

 values regularly spaced between 

y

200−=

/

a

 and 

y

=

4000

 or, alternately, grids 

of the same length but with spacings which increase exponentially from

to 

/4=δ

 at 

y

a

 (both grids lead essentially to the same result). We estimate on 

i

the basis of all our trials, that we were able to compute the exponents (see Eq. (IV.1) below) 

with an uncertainty smaller than 5 %.

for  the  JB  model.  As  indicated  in  Sect.  III,  the  characteristic  exponents  were  estimated  by 

drawing log-log plots of the quantities in Eq. (IV.1) and measuring the slopes in the regions 

where power laws hold. For the sake of illustration, some plots for α, β, γ and ν are shown in 

Figs.  1  and  2.  Fig.  1  deals  with  the  DPB  model  with  external  constraint

8 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Fig. 2 deals with the JB model with the same external constraint. Measurement of the last two 

exponents  δ  and  η  were  performed  on  similar  plots,  but  with  field  (h)  or  wave-vector  (q) 

abscissa.  Note  that  we  used  two  different  external  constraints  for  each  model,  namely 

(

 and 

(

)

2
k

=

y

, which correspond to order parameters 

m =

 and 

m =

2y

, 

respectively. Exponents β, γ and δ depend on the choice of the external constraint, while α, ν 

and η do not. The two sets of characteristics exponents that were obtained for each model are 

summarized in Table I. 

 

At that point, two comments are in order. First, the characteristic exponent for specific 

heat, α, is significantly larger than 1 for both the DPB and the JB models. This confirms that 

both  models  predict  a  first-order  phase  transition  at  DNA  denaturation  temperature 

[16,21,26]. Moreover, the signs in Eq. (IV.1) were chosen such that that exponents are usually 

positive (although α and η are sometimes slightly negative). For the DPB and JB models, the 

order parameter m however diverges at the critical point, so that β and δ are strongly negative. 

B – Rushbrooke’s and Widom’s identities

The  first  two  scaling  laws,  known  as  Rushbrooke’s  and  Widom’s  identities,  can  be 

written in the form

          (IV.2)

free energy, 

f

, can be described by a single homogenous function in 

T

 and h, that is,

illustrated  in  Fig.  3,  which  shows  the  plots  of

          (IV.4) 

The fact that the points corresponding to different values of h all lie on the same line indicates 

that the homogeneity assumption is correctly satisfied. It therefore comes as no surprise that 

Rushbrooke’s  and  Widom’s  identities  are  also  satisfied  by  the  measured  exponents.  This  is 

clearly  seen  in  Table  2,  which  displays,  for  each  polynome 

γ+β+α 2

  and 

( −δβ−γ

)1

,  the 

value  predicted  by  the  corresponding  scaling  law  (column  2)  and  those  obtained  from  the 

measured  values  of  the  characteristic  exponents  (columns  3-6).  Table  2  also  provides 

qualitative uncertainties obtained by assuming that all exponents have additive 5% errors. It is 

seen  that  in  all  cases  the  values  predicted  by  Rushbrooke’s  and  Widom’s  identities  lie  well 

inside the uncertainty range. 

C – Josephson’s identity

 

 

 

 

 

Josephson inequality [27,28] states that  

10 

d

 ,    

          (IV.5) 

where  d  is  the  dimensionality  of  the  system  (here 

1=d

).  This  inequality  converts  to  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

d
2=ν+α

 , 

 

          (IV.6) 

equality known as Josephson’s identity 

if the generalized homogeneity assumption holds, that is, if (i) the only important length near 

the  critical  point  is  the  correlation  length  ξ,  and  (ii)  ξ  is  solely  responsible  for  all  singular 

contributions  to  thermodynamic  quantities.  Note  that  if  the  generalized  homogeneity 

assumption  is  satisfied,  then  the  homogeneity  assumption  of  Eq.  (IV.3)  is  also  satisfied,  so 

that Rushbrooke’s and Widom’s identities are true. 

 

Quite interestingly, examination of Table 2 shows that the computed exponents satisfy 

the inequality of Eq. (IV.5) but not Josephson’s identity. Indeed, the difference between the 

computed values of 

dν+α

 and that predicted by the scaling law (i.e. 2) is larger than three 

times the 5% uncertainty for both models. This indicates that, in contrast with many systems, 

the  generalized  homogeneity  assumption  does  not  hold  for  DNA  denaturation.  As  we 

anticipated  in  the  Introduction,  this  is  not  unexpected  for  systems  which  dissociate  at  the 

critical  point.  Indeed,  these  systems  possess  at  least  one  physical  internal  length  which 

increases infinitely at the critical temperature, so that it is no longer justified to assume that 

everything  is  a  function  only  of  the  ratio  of  a  typical  finite  microscopic  length  to  the 

correlation  length  ξ.  We  unsuccessfully  tried  to  figure  out,  on  the  basis  of  the  numerical 

values  reported  in  Tables  1,  what  quantity  could  replace  the  correlation  length  ξ  in  the 

generalized  homogeneity  assumption  (this  quantity  should  obviously  have  length  dimension 

and a characteristic exponent equal to 

α−2

).

Examination of Table 2 shows that this equality is very far from being satisfied by the models 

for DNA denaturation. The reason for these discrepancies is that Fisher’s identity is based on

         (IV.13) 

While  correct  for  the  Ginzburg-Landau  Hamiltonian  with 

2≥d

,  this  assumption  is  just 

wrong  for  a  system  with 

1=d

  and 

0≈η

  because,  for  these  values  of  d  and  η,  Eq.  (IV.9) 

diverges with increasing values of x. In the TI formalism,

V - Conclusion 

We  investigated  the  validity  of  the  scaling  rules  for  two  dynamical  models  of  DNA 

thermal denaturation. These models indeed display several characteristics, which shed doubts 

on this question : (i) the distance between paired bases, that is, the physical length in terms of 

which the Hamiltonian is expressed, diverges at the melting temperature, (ii) the expressions 

we  assumed  for  the  external  constraint  lead  to  order  parameters,  which  also  diverge  at  the 

critical temperature, (iii) the dimensionality is 

1=d

. Conclusions are : 

-  the  assumption  that  the  free  energy  can  be  described  by  a  single  homogeneous 

function  seems  to  be  rather  robust,  despite  the  divergence  of  the  order  parameter. 

Consequently, Rushbrooke’s and Widom’s identities are valid relations. 

- Josephson’s identity is instead not satisfied. We argued that this is probably due to 

the divergent internal length, which invalidates the assumption that the correlation length is 

solely responsible for singular contributions to thermodynamic quantities. 

- Fisher’s identity is still farther from being satisfied. We showed that this is due to the 

1=d

 dimensionality and obtained an alternative law, which is well satisfied at DNA thermal 

denaturation. 

Of course, one cannot derive general conclusions from a single study, and additional 

work is certainly needed to ascertain the robustness of the homogeneity assumption for free

energy and/or improve Josephson’s identity. This work still indicates that scaling laws must 

be handle with care when dealing with systems with unusual characteristics.

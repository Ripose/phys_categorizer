ABSTRACT.  Electron  temperature  fluctuation  studies  can  help  to  understand  the  nature  of  the  turbulent 
transport in tokamak plasmas. At Tore Supra, a 32-channel heterodyne ECE radiometer has been upgraded 
with two channels of 100 MHz bandwidth and tunable central frequencies allowing the  shift of the plasma 
sample  volume  in  the  radial  direction.  With  the  sufficiently  large  video  bandwidth  and  the  long  sampling 
time,  it  is  possible  to  reduce significantly  the  thermal  noise  and  to  identify  “true”  high frequency  compo-
nents up to 200 kHz from the cross-correlation between these channels.  First results of temperature fluctua-
tion measurements on Tore Supra are reported in this paper.

Studies  of  the  plasma  turbulence  aid  in  understanding  the  nature  of  the  transport 
properties in fusion. Two general types of fluctuations, electrostatic and magnetic, can be 
distinguished  in  tokamak  plasmas.  Magnetic  fluctuations  brake  the  nested  flux  surfaces 
and, therefore, enhance the plasma transport. Electrostatic fluctuations do not destroy the 
nested magnetic topology, however, the enhancement of transport is due to the 
× drifts 
from the fluctuating electric fields [1]. In order to establish a relation between the fluctua-
~
tions and transport, measurements of various fluctuating components, such as 
 
rB
, as well as knowledge of correlations between them, are needed.

Measurements  of  electron  temperature  fluctuations  ( eT

)  by  means  of  correlation 
Electron Cyclotron Emission (ECE) diagnostics are a relatively new subject in probing the 
nature  of  the  turbulent  transport  in  fusion  plasmas.  Results  obtained  at  TEXT-U  [2  -  4], 
W7-AS [5], RTP [6], TEXTOR [7, 8] and Alcator C-Mod [9] have yielded some interest-
ing information on microturbulence properties both of electrostatic and magnetic origins. 
However, no clear characteristics of the turbulent fluctuations in different operational re-
gimes  of  tokamak  plasmas  have  been  obtained  up  to  present  days.  These  measurements 
generally require long integration times. Therefore, they will find their best application in 
experiments in which long(several seconds) stationary plasmas are attained.

On Tore Supra tokamak (R0 = 2.40 m, a = 0.72 m, BT < 4 T, circular cross-section), 
a 32-channel heterodyne ECE radiometer has recently been upgraded to include two chan-
nels for temperature fluctuation measurements with a radial resolution of about 1 cm. Ex-
periments have been performed for about three weeks during the 2004 campaign. The ex-
perimental setup, as well as the first results, are presented in this paper.

radial integration filters the measured data. Therefore, using the raw signals is not impos-
sible but the interpretation is rather difficult. This might have been a limitation in the past 
as most of the analyses were done using the power spectrum [2]. 

However, the ‘instrumental’ noise

(IF)  stage  and/or  by  video  detectors  may  be  a  (non-linear)  function  of  the  input  signal, 
which makes the identification of the ‘real’ temperature fluctuations much more compli-
cated. Therefore, verification that the ‘instrumental’ noise does not dominate the true fluc-
tuation spectra is very important in correlation technique. 

In many correlation ECE experiments [2 - 7, 9], the following simplified analysis 
of  data  to  retrieve  the  information  on  temperature  fluctuations  has  been  used.  In  this 
 is assumed to be insignificant and/or 
analysis, the ‘instrumental’ noise component 
totally uncorrelated. ECE signal SECE(t) from the plasma sample volume can be written in

temperature fluctuations are correlated while the noise is uncorrelated, or even by autocor-
relation for a single ECE signal (if the video bandwidth 
of the ECE radiometer is much 
larger  than  the  spectral  width  of  temperature  fluctuations)  [5,  8].  The  scheme  in  which 
separate frequencies are coming from the same sample plasma volume to observe coherent 
temperature fluctuations and to decorrelate the thermal noise, is shown in Fig. 1(a). If two 
spatial volumes are different (non-overlapping), the cross-correlation analysis is possible 
if  fluctuations  propagate  in  the  plasma  (Fig.  1(b)).  The  phase  velocity 
  and  the  dis-
tance between volumes r determine the time delay

The cross-correlation method does not require ECE signals to be absolutely calibrated. In 
many cases, besides the rms estimation of the fluctuations amplitude, it is useful to calcu-
late the cross-spectral density spectrum for two discrete signals, which is the inverse Fou-

3. Diagnostic set-up 
 
The  Tore  Supra  heterodyne  radiometer  [12]  has  been  recently  upgraded  to  have 
 
1GHz spaced, 500 MHz bandwidth 32 measuring channels (Fig. 2). It is being used on the 
Tore  Supra  tokamak  to  measure  the  electron  cyclotron  emi si n  i  the  frequency  range

78-110 GHz for the first harmonic ordinary (O) mode

and not by the channels frequency spacing. The radiometer can act simultaneously in two 
modes: 

1.  slow  acquisition  mode  during  all  the  plasma  duration: 32 channels 1 ms sam-

pling without aliasing (bandwidth BV1 = 400 Hz); 

2.  fast  acquisition  mode  during  time  plasma  windows  triggered  by  plasma  phe-

nomenon: 32 channels 10 µs sampling without aliasing (bandwidth BV2 = 40 kHz).  

A  precise  absolute  spectral  calibration  is  performed  outside  the  tokamak  vacuum 
vessel  by  using  a  600°C  black  body  source.  Using    analytical  formulas,  post-pulse  data 
processing takes routinely into account the total magnetic field  and the Maxwellian rela-
tivistic radial shift to improve radial location estimate. These formulas are compatible with 
real time processing in order to use ECE data in feedback control loops.  
 
To perform measurements of the electron temperature fluctuations, one radiometer 
channel is split into two (Fig. 3). On each of these two channels, an (IF) YIG filter with 
bandwidth around 100 MHz is introduced. Its central frequency is remotely monitored by 
a driver (designed at the IPP Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany) between 6 and 18 GHz, 
allowing to shift the observation volume in the plasma radially. The IF filters, a Schottky 
diode detector and a video amplifier with 200 kHz bandwidth are placed inside the isola-
tion box. The acquisition is done without aliasing effects. 
 
It  is  important  to  mention  that  the  ripple  in  Tore  Supra  reaches  7%  at  the  edge 
leading to a mismatch between the iso-B lines, which determine the localization of the in-
vestigated volume, and the field lines to which turbulence is perpendicular (Fig. 4). Con-
sequently, for small distance between the two channels the same field line would cross the 
two volumes.

The beam waist wECE is equal to 5.4 cm and is taken to be the same for the two channels. 
The angle α is the difference between the curvature of the iso-B and the field lines. The 
angle of the field lines is negligible with respect to that of the iso-B lines and is thus ne-
glected leading to en expression of α of the form:

position.  This  leads  to  α  between  1.6  and  8.5  degrees,  respectively.  Consequently,  the 
contribution of turbulent fluctuations on the same flux surface to the two channels can be 
neglected for distances greater than 1.5 mm for measurements in the plasma centre and 8 
mm at r/a = 0.4.

4.1 Signal to noise ratio for the Tore Supra radiometer 
 
 
ECE radiation coming from the plasma is attenuated by the waveguides losses and 
millimetric attenuator for total A = 4 dB + 17 dB = 21 dB. The source temperature T seen 
by the radiometer can be defined as follows:

where A’ is about 100 (for 21 dB attenuation), and TN  is the equivalent radiometer tem-
perature noise.  

The  noise  equivalent  power  (NEP)  for  one  polarisation  direction  due  to  fluctua-

tions of the intensity of the thermal radiation equals to [13]:

where BIF,  Bv are IF (SSB) and video bandwidths, respectively. If one assumes TN  to be 
about 10 000 K (due to the mixer and the first IF amplifier; the Shottky detector noise is 
negligible in case of strong IF amplification), the minimum detectable temperature differ-

4.2 Statistical noise level 
 
 
In order to reduce the statistical error below the coherent temperature fluctuation 
amplitude, a long sampling time is required. According to [11], the difference of R12 (see 
  consist  of  white  (Gaussian)  noise  with  a  large  band-
Eq.  (6))  (in  case 
width B) can be written as:

where T is the total integration time. For the present correlation ECE diagnostic on Tore

,  as  can  be 
It  can  be  seen  that  the  statistical  error  depends  on 
found elsewhere in the literature [2, 5]. For example, to resolve the fluctuation amplitude 
of 0.2%, it is necessary to have M = 106 samples to get the error level of 0.1%. For the 
fluctuation  amplitude  of  0.1%, 
samples  are  required  for  the  same  error  level  of 
0.1%.  Error  estimation  (standard  deviation)  for  real  signal  sequences  is  shown  in  Fig.  5 
and deviates slightly from both scaling laws.

 and 

One  additional,  though  very  important,  note  has  to  be  mentioned.  The  sampling 
rate  of  the  diagnostic  is  1  MHz,  however,  the  video  bandwidth  is  limited  by  200  kHz. 
Therefore,  an  oversampling  effect  is  present  in  correlation  ECE  measurements  on  Tore 
Supra. Because of this, the high-frequency tail of the spectra (> 200 kHz) cannot be used 
to  analyse  the  spectral  characteristics  of  fluctuations.  Precautions  should  also  be  taken 
when looking to the cross-correlation functions at time lags smaller than 5x10-6 s. Resam-
pling the input ECE signals at 250 kHz (or smaller frequency) is desirable. 
 
5. First measurements 
 
 
Depending  on  current  in  the  poloidal  coils  and,  hence,  on  the  toroidal  magnetic 
field in the plasma centre, a few measuring scenarios are possible for the correlation ECE 
on Tore Supra. Figure 6 gives the radial region of observation by the correlation ECE as a

function  of  the  current  in  the  poloidal  coils:  Icoils  =  1100  A  corresponds  to  the  central  
toroidal field of about 3.4 T, and Icoils = 1300 A corresponds to BT = 4 T. The value of the 
Shafranov shift depends on heating regime and typically varies between 5 and 12 cm. 
 
5.1 Low-frequency MHD test studies by 32-channel (non-correlation) ECE radiometer 
 

In order to test the theoretical principles described in Section 2, determination of 
the  well  known  harmonic  component,  such  as  the  m/n  =  1/1  precursor  to  sawteeth,  has 
been  done  by  means  of  cross-correlation  between  two  channels  of  the  32-channel  ECE 
radiometer  (non-correlation  set-up).  Figure  7  shows  a  simple  example  of  the  power  
spectral  density  estimation  by  FFT  applied  directly to a typical sawtooth signal with the 
m/n  =  1/1  magnetohydrodynamic  (MHD)  precursor  activity.  Figure  8  shows  the  cross-
correlation  between  two  neighbouring  channels  of  the  present  32-channels  heterodyne 
ECE radiometer (sampling rate 83 kHz) for the same shot but for filtered signals, in order 
to get rid of the sawtooth rise.  

It can be seen that the shape of the signal can influence correlation functions and 
resulting  spectra.  If  the  amplitude  of  fluctuations  (and,  therefore,  correlation  between 
channels) is strong, like in the example shown in Figs. 7 and 8, the real structure in the 
plasma becomes visible even without smoothing the input signals. However, to uncover a 
presence  of  some  broadband  high-frequency  modes  that  may  exist  in  the  plasma  but 
hardly detectable because of the noise, filtering or smoothing of the input signals is desir-
able,  so  the  low-frequency  step-like  components  (such  as  sawteeth)  and  high-frequency 
noise contribution would not influence the tail of the spectra.

activity with the strong m = 1 precursor (a; selected signal is indicated by the black ar-

Typical cross-correlation functions for the whole time window in (a) are given in (b) and 
(c), and depict a strong influence of sawteeth. Black solid arrows in (c) indicate the propa-
gation of  the m = 1 precursor between two plasma sample volumes. Dashed arrow gives 
the time lag between two successive precursor oscillation of about 3.3× 10-4 s, from which 
the rotation frequency of about 3 kHz is deduced. 
 
5.2 Broadband mode identification by correlation ECE 
 

It is known [3, 14] that the gradient of the electron temperature is one of the energy 
source of the turbulent fluctuations. A radial scan at the HFS on Tore Supra has been per-
formed  between  r/a  =  (-0.6)  –  (-0.1)  for  the  central  magnetic  field  BT  =  3.3  T.  A  radial 
separation between two correlation ECE channels of about 1 cm has been chosen. An inte-
gration time of 2 s has been used. A qualitative comparison between cross-power spectral 
densities for two extreme cases, one inside the sawtooth inversion radius at r/a = (- 0.18), 
and one in the Te-gradient region at r/a = (- 0.43), has shown a noticeable difference in the 
frequency range of 20 – 150 kHz (see Fig. 9).  The origin of the “bump” for the CSD in 
the gradient region is not clear yet and may be either an effect of the Doppler shift due to 
the poloidal plasma rotation transposing spectral components to the higher frequencies, or

sawtooth-removed ECE signals. Black arrows on the CSDs give the precise rotation fre-

2kHz is absent in case of filtered ECE signals. 
 
a footprint of the broadband turbulent mode of electro-magnetic nature. The latter is more 
likely, because the “bump” feature has much weaker amplitude at |r/a| > 0.5, whilst one 
would expect the Doppler effect to persist with the higher amplitude with increased value 
of |r/a|. Similar observations have been done at the LFS, too.

From the cross-correlation functions in Fig. 9, it is seen that the broadband struc-
ture with the maximum at 1.9x10-5 s is superimposed on the low-frequency MHD compo-
nents with the bandwidth below 10 kHz. From Fig. 10, an estimation of the relative fluc-
tuation amplitude for a statistical trustable time (and frequency) interval can be made: for 
r/a = (- 0.43), 
is about 0.35% for the broadband structure. For the shot with r/a = (- 
0.18),  the  fluctuation  level  is  much  smaller  and  well  below  the  noise  level  (most  likely 
caused by the Schottky diode detector). Another example is shown in Fig. 10(c), in which 
correlation ECE monitors the plasma center, well inside the sawtooth inversion radius. It 
can be seen that, although the noise component is much weaker than for the shot shown in 
Fig. 9(d), the “real” fluctuations are significantly reduced in their amplitude, compared to 
the Te-gradient region, and estimated to be about 0.2% .

dial location: blue – in the Te-gradient region at the HFS, red – inside the sawtooth inver-
sion radius at the HFS. Plot (a)  shows the CSD for ECE signals have been detrended be-
fore FFT  calculations, in order to  prevent low-frequency  components    due  to  MHD  and 
high-frequency components due to the instrumental noise  to influence the level (offset) of 
the spectra; plot (b) is for the CSD out of high-pass filtered (< 20 kHz) ECE signals (to 
eliminate the low-frequency MHD effects totally). Cross-correlation function for the case 
of  r/a  =  -0.43  (c)  shows  a  presence  of  high-frequency  components  that  are  enhanced  in 
the amplitude, compared to the noise peak (black arrow) at zero time lag; for the case of 
r/a  =  -0.18  (d),  the  noise  component  is  dominant.  Green  horizontal  lines  in  (c)  and  (d) 
shows an offprint of the low-frequency mode of MHD origin with a bandwidth below 10 
kHz, on which high-frequency components are superimposed.  
 

From the phase shift of the broadband structure, the radial propagation velocity is 
found  to  be  about  500  m/s.  More  experiments  dedicated  to  study  broadband  high-
frequency modes are planned in upcoming campaigns on Tore Supra.

normalized ECE signals (1 MHz sampling rate) at r/a = -0.43 (a), and for the same sig-

interval: 5x10-5 s (and above) correspond to 20 kHz (and lower) in frequency field both in 
(a)  and  (b),  and  5x10-6  s  correspond  to  200  kHz  (limitation  by  the  video  detector  band-
width  in  (a)).  Noise  peak  at  zero  time  lag  (and,  therefore,  above  200  kHz)  is  shown  by  
black arrows. Plot (c) is for the case in which correlation ECE monitors plasma inside the 
inversion  radius,  near  the  plasma  center.  For  this  shot  (#33505),  the  noise  component 
(black arrow) is much smaller, compared to the shot presented in Fig. 9(d). 
 

6. Summary and future plans 
 
 
The  feasibility  of  electron  temperature  fluctuation  measurements  on  Tore  Supra 
has been investigated by means of radial correlation ECE diagnostic. Though the range of 
these measurements was limited by the toroidal magnetic field (and also by the restricted 
possibility to change the central frequency of the YIG filter), and only a few experiments 
were conducted so far, first observations of the broadband frequency structure have been 
done in the Te -gradient region, compared to the plasma core inside the sawtooth inversion 
radius. From the collected data, there is no possibility yet to derive the dispersion relation 
and to identify the origin of this structure. In upcoming experimental campaigns, the fol-
lowing studies by means of correlation ECE radiometer are proposed on Tore Supra: 

1.  to perform a detailed radial scan both on the LFS and the HFS to identify the radial 
extent,  correlation length and decorrelation time of the broadband mode and, thus, 
to derive its wavenumbers; 

2.  to  study  the  response  of  turbulence  amplitude  at  different  values  of  the  plasma 

density (e.g. at different collisionality); 

3.  to verify the results reported in [7] that turbulence is separated inside and outside 

the transport barrier, in particular with respect to the rational q surfaces; 

4.  to compare the temperature fluctuation measurements with the density fluctuation 
measurements to obtain a rather comprehensive picture of turbulence in the plasma 
core; 

In the year 2005, a further upgrade of the correlation ECE radiometer is planned. The 
future diagnostic will have several tuneable channel sets allowing detailed studies of  tem-
perature fluctuations over a wider radial range.

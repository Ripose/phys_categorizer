ABSTRACT 

We investigated the release angle that maximises the distance attained in a 
long soccer throw-in.  One male soccer player performed maximum-effort 
throws using release angles of between 10 and 60º, and the throws were 
analysed  using  2-D  video.    The  player’s  optimum  release  angle  was 
calculated  by  substituting  mathematical  expressions  for  the  measured 
relations between release speed, release height, and release angle into the 
equations  for  the  flight  of  a  spherical  projectile.    We  found  that  the 
musculoskeletal  structure  of  the  player’s  body  had  a  strong  influence  on 
the  optimum  release  angle.    When  using  low  release  angles  the  player 
released the ball with a greater release speed, and because the range of a 
projectile is strongly dependent on the release speed, this bias toward low 
release  angles  reduced  the  optimum  release  angle  to  about  30°.  
Calculations  showed  that  the  distance  of  a  throw  may  be  increased  by  a 
few metres by launching the ball with a fast backspin, but the ball must be 
launched at a slightly lower release angle.

INTRODUCTION 

The long throw-in is an important “set play” in soccer, particularly when 
used  as  an  attacking  manoeuvre  near  to  the  goal  mouth.    The  farther  a 
player can throw the ball the larger the area in which his/her team mates 
may receive the ball and the greater the scoring opportunities.  To produce 
a  long  throw  the  player  must  project  the  ball  at  high  speed  and  at  an 
appropriate angle with respect to the horizontal.  In laboratory studies of 
the throw-in, male players have recorded release speeds of 12–19 m/s and 
release angles of 22–40º (Messier and Brody, 1986; Kollath and Schwirtz, 
1988; Bray and Kerwin, 2004; Kerwin and Bray, 2004).  Release speed is 
the  primary  determinant  of  the  range  attained  by  a  projectile,  and  to 
achieve  the  greatest  possible  distance  a  soccer  player  should  release  the 
ball  with  the  greatest  possible  speed.    Identifying  the  optimum  release 
angle  for  a  long  throw-in  is  less  straightforward.    The  optimum  release

angle of a sports projectile is influenced by (1) the physical properties of 
the  projectile,  (2)  the  release  conditions,  and  (3)  the  anatomical  and 
musculoskeletal  constraints  of  the  player’s  body  (de  Mestre,  1990; 
Hubbard, 2000). 
 

Physical properties of the ball 

the  ball,  such  as 

The competition rules for soccer specify the allowable ranges of the most 
the  weight, 
important  physical  properties  of 
circumference, and sphericity (FIFA, 2004).  Although the effects of the 
physical  properties  of  the  ball  on  the  throw  distance  and  the  optimum 
release angle have not been investigated, the range of values allowed by 
the  rules  is  relatively  narrow.    We  therefore  expect  to  see  only  small 
changes  in  the  throw  distance  and  optimum  release  angle  arising  from 
changes  in  the  physical  properties  of  the  ball.    In  any  case,  the  physical 
properties are to a large extent fixed once the ball to be used in the match 
is  selected,  and  they  cannot  easily  be  manipulated  by  the  player  in  an 
effort to increase the distance of a throw.   
 

Release conditions 

In a soccer throw-in, the release conditions that affect the optimum release 
angle are the release speed, release height, and rate of spin.  The effects of 
release  speed  and  release  height  on  the  distance  and  optimum  release 
angle  for  a  moderately  aerodynamic  projectile  such  as  a  soccer  ball  are 
well  established  (de  Mestre,  1990).    For  a  ball  that  is  released  from  a 
typical release height of 2.3 m, the throw distance increases rapidly with 
increasing release speed and the throw distance is a maximum at a release 
angle  of  about  40º.    Changes  in  release  height  do  not  greatly  affect  the 
throw distance or the optimum release angle. 
 
The  spin  imparted  to  the  ball  during  the  release  can  have  a  strong 
influence on the throw distance and the optimum release angle.  In a high-
speed video study of throws by two male players, Bray and Kerwin (2004) 
observed  backspin  at  spin  rates  of  between  0.4  and  1.3  rev/s.    They 
presented  an  aerodynamic  model  that  accurately  predicts  the  flight 
trajectory  of  the  ball,  and  this  model  was  used  to  calculate  the  effect  of 
backspin  on  the  optimum  release  angle.    For  representative  values  of 
release speed (18 m/s) and release height (2.3 m), the calculated optimum 
release angle steadily decreased with increasing backspin, from about 40º 
for a ball released with zero spin, to about 35º for a backspin of 2 rev/s. 
 

Anatomical and musculoskeletal constraints 

Bray  and  Kerwin’s  calculated  optimum  release angles were substantially 
greater than the observed release angles for the two players in their study 
(26 ± 3º and 32 ± 4º).  We suspect that closer agreement would have been 
achieved  by  accounting  for 
the  anatomical  and  musculoskeletal 
constraints of the player’s body in the calculation of the optimum release 
angle.    Studies  of  other  sports  projectile  events  have  shown  that  an

athlete’s  release  speed  and  release  height  vary  with  changes  in  release 
angle,  and  that  the  relations  between  these  release  parameters  determine 
the  athlete’s  optimum  release  angle  (Red  and  Zogaib,  1977;  Linthorne, 
2001; Wakai and Linthorne, 2005; Linthorne et al., 2005).  For example, 
in  the  shot  put  the  musculoskeletal  structure  of  the  human  body  is  such 
that  the  athlete  can  produce  more  throwing  force  in  the  horizontal 
direction than in the vertical direction, and so the maximum release speed 
that  an  athlete  can  attain  decreases  with  increasing  release  angle 
(Linthorne, 2001).  Because the range of a projectile is strongly dependent 
on the release speed, even a small dependence of release speed on release 
angle is sufficient to change the optimum release angle by several degrees.  
In the shot put, the decrease in speed with increasing release angle reduces 
the optimum release angle to about 28–36º.  Also, a shot putter’s release 
height  increases  with  increasing  release  angle  because  of  changes  in  the 
athlete’s body position at the instant of release.  However, this relation has 
only a minor influence on the optimum release angle. 
 

This study 

The  purpose  of  the  present  study  was  to  determine  the  optimum  release 
angle in the long soccer throw-in.  A 2-D video analysis of a player was 
used to obtain mathematical expressions for the relations between release 
speed  and  release  angle,  and  between  release  height  and  release  angle.  
These  expressions  were  combined  with  the  equations  for  the  flight  of  a 
spherical  projectile,  and  the  optimum  release  angle  that  maximises  the 
distance of the throw was calculated.  Simple models of the soccer throw-
in  were  developed  to  explain  the  observed  relations  between  release 
speed, release height, and release angle. 
  We  found  that  the  player  produced  greater  release  speeds  at  lower 
release angles, and that this relation reduced the optimum release angle to 
about 30º.  Although the player’s release height increased with increasing 
release  angle  because  of  changes  in  his  body  position  at  the  instant  of 
release,  this  relation  had  only  a  small  influence  on  the  optimum  release 
angle.  The calculated optimum release angle was in good agreement with 
the  player’s  preferred  release  angle.    We  therefore  concluded  that  our 
method of calculating the optimum release angle, in which we account for 
the  anatomical  and  musculoskeletal  constraints  of  the  player’s  body  as 
well as the aerodynamic flight of the ball, produces an accurate prediction 
of a player’s optimum release angle. 
 
In our study the player launched the ball with as little spin as possible 
so as to reduce the confounding effects of spin on the determination of the 
optimum release angle.  Our calculated optimum projection angle of about 
30º therefore only applies to throws in which the player launches the ball 
with  no  spin.    However,  the  mechanics  of  a  spinning  projectile  is  well 
established, and our throw simulations showed that for realistic values of 
backspin the distance of the throw can be increased by up to a few metres 
with a slight reduction in the optimum release angle.

METHODS 

In  a  long  throw-in,  the  throw  distance  (or  horizontal  range)  R  is  the 
horizontal  distance  the  ball’s  centre  of  mass  travels  from  the  instant  of 
release  to  the  instant  of  landing  (Figure  1).    The  release  parameters  that 
determine the throw distance are the release speed v, the release angle θ, 
the relative release height h (the height difference between the release and 
the  landing),  and  the  spin  rate  of  the  ball  (ω).    To  calculate  a  player’s 
optimum  release  angle  we  require  the  mathematical  expressions  for  the 
relation  between  release  speed  and  release  angle,  v(θ),  and  between 
relative  release  height  and  relative  release  angle,  h(θ).    Intervention  is 
therefore required to obtain measurements of a player’s release speed and 
relative release height over a wide range of release angles, rather than just 
at the player’s preferred release angle.  The expressions for v(θ) and h(θ) 
may be obtained by fitting mathematical relations to plots of release speed 
and relative release height as a function of release angle.

Participant and throwing protocol 

One  collegiate  male  soccer  player  (age  21  years;  height  1.77  m)  was 
recruited  to  participate  in  the  study.    The  study  was  approved  by  the 
Human  Ethics  Committee  of  Brunel  University,  the  participant  was 
informed  of  the  protocol  and  procedures  prior  to  his  involvement,  and 
written consent to participate was obtained.  The throws were conducted 
in still air conditions in an outdoor stadium using a FIFA approved match 
ball  (Mitre  Ultimatch,  size  5).    All  throws  were  performed  from  a  flat 
synthetic surface and the landing area was level with the release surface.  
The participant wore athletic training clothes and sports shoes.  According 
to FIFA competition rules the player must be facing the field of play when

releasing the ball and have part of each foot either on the touchline or on 
the  ground  outside  the  touchline.    The  player  must  deliver  the  ball  from 
behind  and  over  the  head  with  both  hands.    In  this  study  the  participant 
was  instructed  to  use  a  self-selected  throwing  technique  that  complied 
with FIFA regulations. 
 
The  participant  was  instructed  to  perform  five  maximum-effort 
throws  at  his  preferred  release  angle,  and  then  twenty  maximum-effort 
throws at other release angles that ranged from “much higher” to “much 
lower”  than  his  preferred  release  angle.    The  order  of  the  other  release 
angles was altered to preclude any effect resulting from the order.  For all 
throws the participant was instructed to release the ball with as little spin 
as possible (i.e. ω ≈ 0 rev/s).  Depending on the intended angle of release, 
he elected to use a short run-up of 0–4 strides and a delivery stance with 
the  feet  from  0  to  0.8  m  apart.    A  unlimited  rest  interval  was  given 
between 
the  effects  of  fatigue  on  throwing 
performance.    The  throw  distance  was  measured  to  the  nearest  10  cm 
using a fibreglass tape measure.

Video analysis 

A Panasonic AG-455 S-VHS video camera operating at 50 Hz was used to 
record the movement of the ball and player at release.  The video camera 
was mounted on a rigid tripod at a height of 1.8 m, and placed at a right 
angle  to  the  throw  direction  about  25  m  away from the throw line.  The 
field  of  view  was  zoomed  to  allow  the  ball  to  be  in  the  field  of  view 
throughout the run-up and delivery and for at least 10 frames after release.  
The  movement  space  of  the  video  camera  was  calibrated  with  three 
vertical  calibration  poles  that  were  placed  along  the  midline  of  the 
throwing movement and about 3 m apart. 
An  Ariel  Performance  Analysis  System  was  used  to  manually 
 
digitise the motion of the ball in the video images.  The two-dimensional 
coordinates  of  the  centre  of  mass  of  the  ball  were  calculated  from  the 
digitised  data  using  the  direct  linear  transform  (DLT)  algorithm.  
Coordinate data were smoothed using a second-order Butterworth digital 
filter  with  a  cut-off  frequency  of  10  Hz,  and  the  velocity  of  the  ball’s 
centre  of  mass  was  calculated  by  direct  differentiation  of  the  filtered 
coordinate data.  The choice of cut-off frequency was based on a residual 
analysis (Winter, 1990) and a visual inspection of the power spectra of the 
coordinate  and  velocity  data.    The  instant  of  release  was  defined  as  the 
first  frame  in  which  the  ball  was  observed  to  break  contact  with  the 
player’s  hands.    The  release  speed  and  release  angle  of  the  ball  were 
calculated from the horizontal and vertical speed at the instant of release, 
and the release height was the vertical distance of the centre of mass of the 
ball relative to the ground. 
 
All digitising was performed by the same operator to maximise the 
consistency of the dependent variables.  In this study the greatest source 
of uncertainty in the measured values arose from the sampling frequency 
of  the  video  camera,  and  this  uncertainty  was  taken  as  one  half  the

difference between the value at the instant of release and the value at one 
frame before the instant of release.  The calculated uncertainties due to the 
video  sampling  rate  were  about  0.2  m/s  for  release  speed,  0.07  m  for 
release height, and 1.3º for release angle. 
 

Model of the flight of a soccer ball 

During its flight through the air a projectile may experience aerodynamic 
effects  that  arise  from  the  interaction  of  the  projectile  with  the 
surrounding air.  In the shot put these aerodynamic effects are negligible 
and  range  of  the  shot  may  be  calculated  using  the  equations  for  a 
projectile in free flight.  In the soccer throw-in, aerodynamic drag and lift 
can substantially affect the trajectory of the ball, and so a more complex 
aerodynamic model must be used to calculate the throw distance. 
 
The  magnitude  of  the  drag  force  on  a  soccer  ball  depends  on  the 
speed of the ball through the air, the cross-sectional area of the ball, and 
the  shape  and  surface  characteristics  of  the  ball.    The  shape  and  surface 
characteristics  are  accounted  for  by  a  scale  factor  called  the  drag 
coefficient, CD.  At speeds typical of the soccer throw-in, a soccer ball has 
a  drag  coefficient  of  about  CD  =  0.2  (Bray  and  Kerwin,  2004).    The 
trajectory of a soccer ball is also influenced by the rate and direction of its 
spin.    A  spinning  ball  creates  a  lift  force  through  the  Magnus  effect.  
When backspin is applied to the ball the lift force tends to be upwards and 
the horizontal range of the ball is increased, and when topspin is applied 
to the ball the lift force tends to be downwards and the horizontal range of 
the ball is decreased.  The magnitude of the lift force depends on the rate 
of  spin,  which  is  reflected  in  the  value  of  the  lift  coefficient,  CL.    For  a 
ball  that  is  projected  with  zero  spin  (as  in  the  present  study)  the  lift 
coefficient is about CL = 0. 
We  analysed  the  trajectory  of  the  soccer  ball  in  a  rectangular 
 
coordinate  system  where  the  positive  x-axis  is  in  the  forward  horizontal 
direction  and  the  positive  y-axis  is  vertically  upwards.    The  flight 
trajectory equations of the soccer ball are then (de Mestre, 1990; Bray and 
Kerwin, 2004)

where v is the speed of the ball relative to the air, and g is the acceleration 
due to gravity.  The constant k is given by k = ρS/(2m), where ρ is the air 
density (1.225 kg/m3 at sea level and 15ºC), S is the cross-sectional area of 
the ball (0.038 m2), and m is the mass of the ball (0.43 kg). 
 
If the initial conditions of the ball (i.e. release speed, release height, 
and release angle) are known, the trajectory of the ball may be computed

and  the  distance  of  the  throw  determined.    Because  the  release  speed, 
release  height,  and  release  angle  are  inter-related,  we  used  the  measured 
expressions  for  v(θ)  and  h(θ)  to  generate  the  initial  conditions  for  the 
flight trajectory equations.  The flight trajectory equations are non-linear 
and so must be computed using numerical methods.  In this study we used 
a 
technical  computing  software  package  (Mathematica;  Wolfram 
Research,  Champaign,  IL)  to  calculate  the  flight  trajectories.    The 
calculated  throw  distance  was  plotted  against  release  angle,  and  the 
optimum  release  angle  was  the  point  on  the  curve  at  which  the  throw 
distance was greatest. 
 

RESULTS 

The mean values of the throw distance, release speed, release height, and 
release  angle  for  the  throws  at  the  participant’s  preferred  release  angle 
were 17.0 ± 0.8 m, 13.4 ± 0.3 m/s, 2.23 ± 0.02 m and 32.1 ± 1.6° (mean ± 
s) respectively.  These values are similar to those reported in other studies 
of  the  soccer  throw-in  (Messier  and  Brody,  1986;  Kollath  and  Schwirtz, 
1988; Bray and Kerwin, 2004; Kerwin and Bray, 2004).  Figures 2 and 3 
show  the  release  height  and  release  speed  as  a  function  of  the  release 
angle.   
 

Release height 

A simple anthropometric model of the throw was developed and used to 
explain  the  observed  increase  in  release  height  with  increasing  release 
angle.  At the instant of ball release the player was standing almost upright 
with his arms straight and at an angle α to the horizontal (Figure 4).  The 
release height is then given by 

hrelease  =  hshoulder  +  larm sin α , 

(3) 

where  hshoulder  is  the  height  of  the  player’s  shoulders  when  standing 
upright, and larm is the length of the player’s outstretched arms.  The angle 
of  the  arms  to  the  horizontal  was  not  the  same  as  the  release  angle,  but 
there  was  a  strong  linear  relation  between  the  two  angles.    The  release 
height may therefore be expressed by 

hrelease  =  hshoulder  +  larm sin (Aθ  + αo) , 

(4) 

where  A  is  the  rate  of  increase  in  the  arm  angle  with  increasing  release 
angle, and αo is the arm angle for a horizontal release.  In this study we 
required  an  expression  for  the  relative  release  height,  rather  than  the 
release height.  The relative release height is given by

equal to the radius of the ball, and so we obtain

where rball is the radius of the ball (0.11 m). 
 
A curve of the form of equation (4) was fitted to the plot of release 
height  as  a  function  of  release  angle  (Figure  2)  by  selecting  values  of 
hshoulder, larm, A and αo using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (Press et 
al., 1988).  However, with four fitted parameters the uncertainties in some 
of the calculated values were about the same magnitude as the value of the 
parameter.    Better  results  were  obtained  with  just  three fitted parameters 
(hshoulder,  A  and  αo).    Video  measurements  showed  that  the  distance 
between  the  player’s  shoulders  and  the  ball  at  the  instant  of  release 
remained  approximately  constant  across  all  release  angles,  with  an 
average  value  of  larm  =  0.80  m.    A  curve  was  again  fitted  to  the  plot  of 
release  height  as  a  function  of  release  angle.    The  calculated  values  and 
standard errors of the fitted parameters were hshoulder = 1.58 ± 0.07 m, A = 
1.0  ±  0.3  and  αo  =  21  ±  5°,  and  the  fitted  curve  for  the  participant  is 
shown  in  Figure  2.    The  calculated  shoulder  height  is  in  approximate 
agreement with the player’s actual body dimensions (1.45 m).

height and release angle (Figure 2). 

Release speed 

The  release  action  in  the  soccer  throw-in  is  a  moderately  complex 
movement.    A  simple  model  of  the  release  was  devised  in  an  attempt  to 
explain  the  observed  decrease  in  release  speed  with  increasing  release 
angle  (Figure  3).    As  the  player  moves  the  ball  back  behind  his  head  in 
preparation for the thrust with the arms, there is a moment when the speed 
of  the  ball  is  close  to  zero.  The throw-in action was reduced to just the 
thrust phase, from the time the ball is stationary to the instant of release.  
During the thrust with the arms the player is assumed to apply a constant 
force  F  to  the  ball.    This  force  accelerates  the  ball  along  a  straight-line

path to produce a release angle θ.  We assume that the weight of the ball is 
negligible  in  comparison  to  the  force  exerted  by  the  player  on  the  ball.  
The release speed is then given by (Linthorne, 2001) 

v  =  

2 F l
m   , 

 

 

 

 

where l is the length of the acceleration path, and m is the mass of the ball. 
Unfortunately this model is too simplistic.  The model implies that 
 
the  release  speed  is  independent  of  release  angle,  but  our  measurements 
show that release speed decreases with increasing release angle (Figure 3).  
We  therefore  modified  the  model  by  assuming  that  the  musculoskeletal 
structure of the human body is such that a player can exert more force on 
the  ball  when  throwing  horizontally  than  when  throwing  vertically 
(Linthorne, 2001).  We also assume that the force exerted by the player on 
the ball decreases linearly with release angle.  That is, the force is given 
by 

F  =  Fo – aθ  , 

where Fo is the average force exerted on the ball for a horizontal release 
angle,  and  a  is  a  constant  that  characterizes  the  force  decrease  with 
increasing release angle.  The constant a is expected to be specific to the 
player.    It  should  depend  on  the  player’s  body  dimensions,  muscle 
strengths,  and  throwing  technique.    The  relation  between  release  speed 
and release angle is then given by 

v(θ)  =  

2 (Fo – aθ) l
m

 

  . 

A curve of the form of equation (9) was fitted to the plot of release 
 
speed as a function of release angle (Figure 3) by selecting values of Fo, l 
and  a  using  the  Levenberg-Marquardt  algorithm  (Press  et  al.,  1988).  
However,  with  three  fitted  parameters  the  uncertainties  in  the  calculated 
values  were  several  hundred  times  the  value  of  the  parameter.    Better 
results  were  obtained  with  just  two  fitted  parameters  (Fo  and  a).    Our 
video  measurements  showed  that  the  acceleration  path  length  remained 
approximately constant across all release angle, with an average value of l 
=  1.14  m.    A  curve  was  again  fitted  to  the  plot  of  release  speed  as  a 
function of release angle.  The calculated values and standard errors of the 
fitted parameters were Fo = 46 ± 2 N and a = 0.44 ± 0.04 N/degree, and 
the fitted curve for the participant is shown in Figure 3.  The average force 
exerted by the player on the ball is much less than the force the player can 
exert  in  an  isometric  contraction.    The  difference  between  static  and 
dynamic  force  production  is  a  well-known  phenomenon  owing  to  the 
force-velocity relation of contracting muscle. 
 
Although equation (9) gives a good fit to the experimental data and 
the  fitted  value  of  Fo  appears  to  have  some  correspondence  to  physical 
reality,  the  model  behind  the  equation  is  simplistic.    The  release  force

11 

generated by the player is probably not constant, as assumed in the model.  
The  force  generated  by  the  player  is  expected  to  change  throughout  the 
release  because  of  the  changing  lengths,  moment  arms,  and  contraction 
speeds of the player’s muscles (van den Tillaar and Ettema, 2004).  Also, 
we  have  no  experimental  evidence  that  the  average  force  exerted  by  the 
player is the same for all release angles.  Therefore, the practical value of 
the simple model used here should not be extended beyond the ability to 
provide a good fit to the release speed versus release angle data (Figure 3). 
 

Optimum release angle 

The  optimum  release  angle  for  the  participant  was  calculated  and 
compared  with  his  preferred  release  angle.    To  calculate  the  optimum 
release  angle  the  values  of  hshoulder,  A  and  αo  were  substituted  into 
equation (6) and the values of Fo and a were substituted into equation (9).  
The resulting expressions for h(θ) and v(θ) were then used to generate the 
initial conditions for the flight trajectory equations (equations 1 and 2) for 
a series of release angles between 0° and 90° in steps of 0.01°.  For each 
release  angle  the  flight  trajectory  was  calculated  and  the  throw  distance 
and flight time were recorded.  The calculated throw distance was plotted 
against release angle, and the optimum release angle was the point on the 
curve at which the throw distance was greatest. 
 
The  flight  trajectory  calculation  required  an  estimate  of  the  drag 
coefficient of the ball.  In this study we used the measured throw distances 
to  determine  the  drag  coefficient.    For  each  of  the  25  throws  by  the 
participant, the range of the throw was calculated by using the measured 
release speed, release height, and release angle as the initial conditions in 
the  flight  trajectory  model.    The  drag  coefficient  in  the  flight  trajectory 
model  was  adjusted  from  0.10  to  0.30  in  increments  of  0.01,  and  the 
calculated  throw  distances  for  each  of  the  25  throws  by  the  participant 
were  recorded.    Best  agreement  between  the  calculated  throw  distances 
and the measured throw distances was achieved with a drag coefficient of 
CD = 0.25, and this value was taken as the drag coefficient of the ball in 
the calculations of the optimum release angle. 
 
For  the  player  in  this  study,  the  calculated  optimum  release  angle 
(29.7°  ±  1.5°)  was  in  good  agreement  with  the  participant’s  preferred 
release  angle  (32.1  ±  0.8°).    The  calculated  optimum  release  angle  was 
insensitive to the value of the drag coefficient that was used in the flight 
trajectory  model.    A  drag  coefficient  of  CD  =  0.15  gave  an  optimum 
release  angle  of  30.1°  and  drag  coefficient  CD  =  0.35  gave  an  optimum 
release angle of 29.4°.  Therefore, we conclude that our method, in which 
the measured relations for v(θ) and h(θ) are combined with the equations 
that describe the flight trajectory of ball, produces an accurate calculation 
of a player’s optimum release angle. 
The combined effects of v(θ) and h(θ) on the optimum release angle 
 
are  illustrated  in  Figure  5.    For  a  non-aerodynamic  projectile  that  is 
released from ground level, the optimum release angle is 45°.  However, 
this optimum release angle is only appropriate if the athlete can produce

12 

the same release speed at all release angles.  The musculoskeletal structure 
of the human body is such that a soccer player is able to produce a greater 
release  speed  when  releasing  the  ball  a  low  release  angle.    Because  the 
range  of  a  projectile  is strongly dependent on the release speed, the bias 
towards  low  release  angles  reduces  the  optimum  release  angle  by  about 
10°.  Also, in a soccer throw-in the ball is released from about 2 m above 
the  landing,  and  this  release  height  increases  slightly  with  increasing 
release  angle  because  of  changes  in  the  player’s  body  position  at  the 
instant  of  release.    However,  the  player’s  height-angle  relation  has  a 
relatively  small  effect  on  the  optimum  release  angle;  it  reduces  the 
optimum  release  angle  by  only  about  4°.    A  soccer  ball  is  a  moderately 
aerodynamic  projectile  and  it  experiences  substantial  aerodynamic  drag 
during its flight through the air.  Although aerodynamic drag reduces the 
throw distance by a few metres, it reduces the optimum release angle by 
only about 2°.

Figure 5  Measured throw distance as a function of release angle.  Also 
shown is the calculated throw distance (solid line) and a polynomial fit to 
the throw distance data (dashed line).  The optimum release angle for this 
player is about 30°. 

 
 
An alternative method of identifying the optimum release angle for 
a player is to fit a regression curve directly to the measured throw distance 
versus  release  angle  data  (Figure  5).    A  second-degree  polynomial  was 
found to be the most appropriate fit as it produced the lowest coefficient 
of  variation  in  the  regression  equation  coefficients.    The  calculated 
optimum release angle obtained using this method was very close to that 
obtained  using  equations  (6)  and  (9).    However,  this  direct  method  of 
determining  the  optimum  release  angle  has  a  greater  uncertainty  in  the 
calculated value (28.7 ± 8.5°) and does not shed light on the factors that 
determine the player’s optimum release angle.

An  important  practical  result  from  our  study  is  that  projecting  the 
ball  at  the  optimum  release  angle  is  not  very important in a producing a 
long throw.  From Figure 5 we see that the throw distance is not sensitive 
to  release  angle,  and  so  relatively  large  errors  in  release  angle  can  be 
tolerated.    For  the  player  in  this  study  the  release  angle  needed  to  be 
within  about  7°  of  the  optimum  release  angle  for  the  throw  to  be  within 
0.5 m (3%) of the maximum achievable distance. 
 

DISCUSSION and IMPLICATIONS 

Limitations of the study 

The use of a 50 Hz video camera to measure the release variables was not 
a  significant  limitation  of  this  study.    The  variability  in  the  participant’s 
throws was greater than the measurement uncertainties introduced through 
the  sampling  rate  of  the  video  camera.  Therefore, using a video camera 
with  a  sampling  rate  of  100  or  200  Hz  would  not  have  substantially 
reduced the uncertainty in the mathematical expressions for v(θ) and h(θ), 
and  would  not  have  produced  a  more  accurate  estimate  of  the  optimum 
release angle. 
 
Although  several  simplifying  assumptions  were  introduced  to  the 
models that were used to determine v(θ) and h(θ), the conclusions of the 
study  are  not  affected  by  these  simplifications.    The  mathematical 
expressions used for v(θ) and h(θ) produced good fits to the experimental 
data  (Figures  2  and  3),  and  gave  an accurate calculation of the optimum 
release  angle.    As  an  alternative  to  the  models,  we  obtained  expressions 
for v(θ) and h(θ) by fitting polynomial equations to the release speed and 
release  height  data.    For  both  v(θ)  and  h(θ),  a  first-degree  polynomial 
produced  the  lowest  coefficient  of  variation  in  the  regression  equation 
coefficients.    The  calculated  optimum  release  angle  obtained  using  the 
polynomials was similar (29.3 ± 1.5°) to that obtained using equations (6) 
and (9). 
 

Flight time 

Launching the ball at the release angle that maximises the throw distance 
may not be the most appropriate strategy.  In the attacking long throw-in 
the player would like to maximise the element of surprise by passing the 
ball to his/her team mate in as short a time as possible.  At release angles 
near  to  the  optimum  release  angle  (30º)  the  flight  time  decreases  with 
decreasing release angle (Figure 6).  Therefore, if the player launches the 
ball  a  few  degrees  below  the  optimum  release  angle,  the  throw  distance 
will  be  essentially  the  same  but  the  flight  time  of  the  throw  will  be 
reduced.  For the player in this study the flight time decreases at a rate of 
about 0.025 s per 1° decrease in release angle.  If he throws the ball at 4° 
below  the  optimum  release  angle,  the  throw  distance  will  be  almost  the 
same  as  the  maximum  possible  distance  (99%)  but the flight time of the 
throw  will  be  reduced  by  about  0.1  s  (7%).    If  he  decides  to  sacrifice  a

little more distance (6%) by launching the ball at 10° below the optimum 
release  angle,  he  can  gain  a  time  advantage  of  about  0.3  s  (20%).    A 
reduction in flight time of 0.1–0.3 s might be the decisive factor in turning 
a long throw-in into a goal scoring opportunity.

Inter-individual differences 

In this study we investigated the optimum release angle in only one male 
player.    In  a  study  of  the  shot  put,  Linthorne  (2001)  found  that  the 
optimum release angle was unique to the athlete.  The five athletes in his 
study  had  optimum  release  angles  that  differed  by  6°  because  of  inter-
individual differences in the shape of the speed-angle curve.  We suspect 
that in the soccer throw-in the optimum release angle may also be unique 
to the player.  Inter-individual differences in body size, muscular strength 
and  elasticity,  and  throwing  technique  may  produce  differences  in  the 
shape  of  the  speed-angle  curve,  and  hence  result  in  different  optimum 
release angles. 
The two players in the study by Bray and Kerwin (2004) were more 
 
proficient in the long throw-in than the player in our study.  For the two 
players in Bray and Kerwin’s study, we estimated the shape of the speed-
angle  relation  that  would  produce  throw  distances  and  optimum  release 
angles equal to their observed values (28.9 m and 26º for Player A; 21.1 m 
and  32º  for  Player  B).    In  our  model  of  the  throw-in  (equation  9),  the 
throw  distance  is  mostly determined by the average force exerted by the 
player  on  the  ball  (Fo),  and  the  optimum  release  angle  is  mostly 
determined by the rate of force decrease with increasing release angle (a).  
The  greater  the  average  force  the  longer  the  throw  distance,  and  the 
greater the rate of force decrease the lower the optimum release angle.  In 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
N. P. LINTHORNE and D. J. EVERETT 

15 

comparison to the player in the present study, we calculate that Player A 
had a much greater throwing force (Fo = 125 N) and a greater rate of force 
decrease  (a  =  1.35  N/degree),  whereas  Player  B  had  a  slightly  greater 
throwing force (Fo = 62 N) and a similar rate of force decrease (a = 0.44 
N/degree). 
 
In the long soccer throw-in it is much more important for a player 
to attain a high release speed than to throw at the optimum release angle.  
The  range  of  a  moderately  aerodynamic  projectile  is  approximately 
proportional to the square of the release speed.  The implication is that to 
achieve  longer  throws  the  player  should  work  on  developing  muscular 
strength and on improving his/her throwing technique.  Improvements in 
strength  and/or  technique  are  expected  to  shift  the  speed-angle  relation 
(Figure 3) upwards, hence producing a greater maximum throw distance at 
a similar optimum release angle. 
 

Ball size and mass 

We  used  the  flight  trajectory  equations  (equations  1  and  2)  and  the 
measured v(θ) and h(θ) relations to investigate the effects of the physical 
properties  of  the  ball  on  the  maximum  throw  distance  and  the  optimum 
release angle.  FIFA (2004) competition rules state that the circumference 
of the ball must be between 68 and 70 cm, and the weight of the ball must 
be between 410 and 450 g.  A larger diameter ball experiences a greater 
aerodynamic  drag  during  its  flight  through  the  air,  and  so  the  maximum 
throw distance is shorter and the optimum release is lower than for a small 
ball.  For a heavy ball the relative effect of aerodynamic drag compared to 
that of gravity is less, and so the maximum throw distance and optimum 
release angle are greater than for a light ball.  However, the effects of the 
permitted  variations  in  the  circumference  and  mass  of  the  ball  are  very 
small.    The  differences  in  the  throw  distance  and  optimum  release  angle 
between the upper and lower limits of ball circumference are only 0.12 m 
and 0.05°, and the differences between the upper and lower limits of ball 
mass are only 0.19 m and 0.08°.  Although the preceding calculations are 
specific to the player in our study, we do not expect substantially different 
values  for  other  players.    The  calculated  effects  are  so  small  that  they 
would  be  difficult  to  verify  experimentally,  even  with  a  ball-launching 
machine.    We  conclude  that  variations  in  ball  mass  and  circumference 
have no practical implications in the long throw-in. 
 

Passes to head-height and chest-height 

In  this  study,  we  assumed  that  the  ball  lands  on  the  ground  and  that  the 
player  wishes  to  maximise  the  horizontal  distance  that  the  ball  travels 
from release to landing.  In practice, a player may sometimes wish to pass 
the ball to a player so that s/he receives the ball at chest-height or head-
height.  We repeated our calculations of the optimum release angle so that 
the ball was received by the player at a range of heights from ground level 
to  2.0  m  above  the  ground  (Figure  7).    Receiving  the  ball  above ground

16 

level reduces the throw distance and increases the optimum release angle.  
If  the  player  receives  the  ball  at  chest  height  (about  1.3  m),  the  throw 
distance is reduced by about 1.3 m (8%) and the optimum release angle is 
increased  by  about  2.3°.    For  a  pass  to  head-height  (about  1.8  m)  the 
throw distance is reduced by about 1.9 m (12%) and the optimum release 
angle is increased by about 3.4°.

Backspin 

In our study the player launched the ball with as little spin as possible so 
as  to  reduce  the  confounding  effects  of  spin  on  the  determination  of  the 
optimum release angle.  The calculated optimum projection angle for the 
player  of  about  30º  therefore  only  applies  to  throws  in  which  the  ball  is 
launched with no spin.  However, the influence of spin on the trajectory of 
a spherical projectile such as a soccer ball is well established, and so we 
performed  calculations  to  determine  the  effects  of  backspin  on  the 
player’s maximum throw distance and the optimum release angle. 
 
A ball that is launched with backspin produces a lift force that tends 
to  increase  the  distance  of  the  throw.    The  magnitude  of  the  lift  force 
depends  on  the  rate  of  spin  and  is  reflected  in  the  value  of  the  lift 
coefficient,  CL.    Video  analysis  of  the  flight  trajectories  of  a  soccer  ball 
indicate  that  the  lift  coefficient  increases  exponentially  with  increasing 
spin  rate,  from  CL  =  0  for  no  spin,  up  to  a  limiting  value  of  about  CL  = 
0.25.    Here,  we  assume  a  relation  given  by  CL  =  –0.25 e–0.5ω  +  0.25, 
where ω is the spin rate in revolutions per second (Carré et al., 2002; Bray 
and  Kerwin,  2004).    A  spinning  ball  also  has  a  slightly  greater  drag 
coefficient than a non-spinning ball.  For a spinning soccer ball the drag 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
N. P. LINTHORNE and D. J. EVERETT 

17 

coefficient  is  expected  to  increase  at  a  rate  of  about  0.01  per  1  rev/s 
increase in spin rate (Smits and Smith, 1994).   
 
The calculated effects of backspin on the player’s maximum throw 
distance  and  optimum  release  angle are shown in Figure 8.  Most of the 
effects are due to the increase in the lift coefficient.  The increase in lift 
coefficient tends to produce a longer throw and a lower optimum release 
angle, whereas the increase in drag coefficient tends to produce a shorter 
throw and a lower optimum release angle.  A spin of 3 rev/s is probably 
close to the maximum that a player can achieve in a throw-in.  If a player 
were  to  achieve  a  spin  rate  of  3  rev/s  the  throw  distance  would  be 
increased  by  about  1.2  m  (8%)  and  the optimum release angle would be 
lowered  by  about  3°.    In  our  calculations  the  throw  distance  reaches  a 
maximum at a spin rate of about 5 rev/s.  At higher spin rates the gain in 
distance due to the greater lift is outweighed by the loss in distance due to 
greater drag.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

This  study  showed  that  the  optimum  release  angle  in  the  long  soccer 
throw-in  is  considerably  less  than  45°.    The  release  speed  a  player  can 
generate  increases  at  lower  release  angles,  and  this  bias  reduces  the 
optimum  release  angle  to  about  30°.    The  height  difference  between 
release and landing has only a small effect on the optimum release angle.  
The optimum release angle is probably slightly different for each player, 
and  may  depend  on  the  player’s  body  size,  muscular  strength,  and 
throwing  technique.    To  produce  a  longer  throw  we recommend that the 
player  work  on  increasing  the  release  speed  by  developing  explosive

18 

strength in the muscles used in the throwing movement, and by improving 
his/her throwing technique. 
 
It is not essential to launch the ball at precisely the optimum release 
angle  as  deviations  of  several  degrees  do  not  substantially  reduce  the 
distance of the throw.  The distance  achieved in a long throw is greatest 
when  the  player  receives  the  ball  at  ground  level.    When  a  throw  is 
received  at  chest-height  or  head-height  the  throw  distance  is  a  little  less 
and the ball should be launched a few degrees higher. 
In  an  attacking  long  throw,  launching  the  ball  for  maximum 
 
distance  may  not  be  the  most  appropriate  strategy.    We  recommend  that 
the  player  should  deliberately  launch  the  ball  a  few  degrees  below  the 
optimum  release  angle.    This  will  reduce  the  flight  time  of  the  throw 
without substantially reducing the throw distance, and hence provide the 
attacking  team  with  a  greater  element  of  surprise.    We  also  recommend 
that  the  player  should  launch  the  ball  with  a  high  backspin.    This  will 
increase  the  distance  of  the  throw,  as  long  as  the  player’s  technique  for 
producing backspin does not reduce the release speed.  The player should 
reduce  the  release  angle  by  a  few  degrees  if  s/he  launches  the  ball  with 
substantial backspin.

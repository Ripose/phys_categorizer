I-Introduction 
 

The treatment of excitation and ionization of clusters in high velocity collisions is a 
difficult  task.  A  brief  survey  of  theoretical  approaches  developed  in  the  past  has  been 
published some years ago [2]. Since then, most of the theoretical studies have concerned 
stopping  power  calculations,  which  include  the  sum  of  excitation  and  ionization  (see  [3] 
and  references  therein).  In  the  present  model  developed  by  the  authors,  a  separate 
treatment  of  the  two  electronic  processes  is  made.    The  model,  referred  as  to  the  IAE 
model in the following, is based on a strong independent-atoms approximation [1]. In this 
paper,  we  try  to  estimate  quantitatively  the  consequences  of  this  “atomic  approach”  for 
predictions of integrated excitation and ionization cross sections (over final states, collision 
impact  parameter  and  cluster  orientation).  For  doing  so,  the  IAE  model  is  presented  in  a 
quantum  context  (&II)  and  associated  approximations  estimated  for  the  H2  molecule.  In 
&III,  confrontation  between  predictions  of  the  model  and  experimental  results  for 
excitation and single and multiple ionization of small ionic carbon clusters is presented. 
 
II-The independent atom and electron collisional model 
 

In this paragraph, we will formalize, give expressions and tentatively estimate the 
errors  associated  to  the  various  approximations  of  the  independent  atom  and  electron 
collisional model. For simplicity, we consider the case of a  collision  between a structure 
less ion projectile and a cluster and assume a linear ion trajectory. 
 
 1-Quantum formalism

rrΨ

nuclei). This equation is derived from the time independent Schrödinger equation in case 
the coupling  between the system under study (here the cluster) and the environment (the 
impinging ion) is small [4]. We have (atomic units are used):

We decide to describe the state of the system (cluster) in the space E which is 
the  tensorial  product  of  the  spaces  of  the  N  atomic  constituents,  which  is  always

ani(t) is the probability amplitude for the nth atom, initially in the state |i n >, to be in the

a first order perturbative treatment, a mixture of states having a single atom excited.

as in the case of the initial state, we consider approximate final wave functions for the 
cluster which are tensorial products of atomic wave functions. Then it is readily found, 
using  (5)  and  (6),  that  only  states  of  the  form  |E1,i2,…iN>,  |  i1,E2,  i3…iN>,….|  i1,i2,… 
EN>  may  be  reached  at  a  first  order  of  the  ion-cluster  interaction  potential.  Since  all 
these states are orthogonal, we have for the first order probability of finding the cluster 
in a state of excitation Ef after the collision:

is the usual first –order atomic  probability for promoting atom j in a state of excitation 
energy Ej [5],  a probability which depends on the impact parameter bj of incident ion 
with respect to atom j.  
 

We  deduce  from  what  precedes  that  multiple  electronic  excitation  of  a  cluster 
made of monoelectronic atoms cannot occur through a first order treatment. For double 
(triple…) excitation in this last case, a treatment to second (third…) order with respect 
to the perturbative potential must be done. 
 
β-second-order treatment 
 

The probability for double atom excitation of the cluster is derived in a second 
order treatment. For excitation of atoms i and j into states Ei and Ej respectively we find:

Equation  (10b)  is  then  valid  in  case  of  two  identical  atoms,  seen  at  the  same  impact

atoms  are  seen  at  different  impact  parameters  and  are  excited  in  the  same  final  state, 
there  is  a  compensation  between  the  two  terms  or  RHS  of  equation  (10a)  when

In the case of double electronic excitation (ionization) of a cluster, two routes are 
then generally possible : either by excitation (ejection) of two electrons from the same 
atom using equation (7) with the probability (8) being the product of individual electron 
probabilities within the independent electron approximation (we do not comment further 
this  well  documented  approximation  [6  and  references  therein]);  or,  by  excitation 
(ionization) of one electron on two different atoms, using equation (11). Within second 
order  treatment,  we  find  also  that  the  probability  of  exciting  atom  i  without  exciting 
(1)(Ej)).  We 
atom  j  has  the  form  of  equation  (11)  with  Patj
retrieve then, for single and double ionization, equations reported in previous references 
within the IAE model [1,7] ; the case of triple ionization is derived in a similar manner 
and includes first-order, second-order and triple-order contributions. 
 
2-Validity of the approximations  
 

(1)(Ej)  replaced  by  (1-  Patj

Whereas the independent electron approximation has been applied with success, 
even in outer shells of atoms [6], the most severe approximation of the IAE model is the 
assumption of independent atoms within the cluster. In particular, writing (3) in place of 
(2) for the initial cluster wave function has the following qualitative consequences: 
 
i) the electronic density, electronic binding energies are incorrect  
ii) neglect of the sharing of electrons between atoms, a typical « molecular » effect, will 
destroy  interference effects on excitation probabilities 
 
We will discuss these points with reference to the most simple case, single ionisation of 
an  hydrogen  molecule  by  impact  of  a  bare  ion,  presently  the  subject  of  great 
experimental and theoretical interests ([8] and references therein).  
 

Within  the  IAE  model,  H2  is  made  of  two  independent  H  atoms,  whose  states 
coincide  with  the  state  of  the  unique  electron  (electron  1  for  atom  1,  electron  2  for 
atom2).  We  express  the  probability  of  ionisation  of  H2  between  the  initial  state  Ψi-IAE 
(ground  state)  and  the  final  state  Ψf-IAE  (plane  wave  k   for  one  of  the  electron).  We 
have, according to what precedes: 
|Ψi-IAE>=|1s(1),1s(2)>  
|Ψf-IAE>= |k(1), 1s (2)> and |1s(1), k(2)>

that means,  and since the screening parameter tends to reduce the probability, a value 
close to what is obtained within the independent atom approximation (formula (13)).  
 
When  u  makes an angle θ≠0° with the incident beam, interference patterns are smaller 
[8].  In  the  end,  integrating  (19)  over  b   we  find  for  the  ionisation  cross  section  in  H2 
roughly  twice  the  ionization  cross  section  in  H,  as  observed  experimentally  at  high 
enough energy [13].

The  case  of  more  complex  systems  will  not  be  treated  at  all  and  will  be  the 
subject  of  future  work.  One  can  expect  that,  for  the  small  carbon  clusters  which  have 
been experimentally studied and whose comparison with the IAE model is given in the 
next  paragraph,  these  approximations  remain  reasonable.  In  carbon  clusters,  the 
electronic  wave  function  of  the  ground  state  has  often  been  developed  on  a  linear 
combination of atomic 2s and 2p orbitals only, either in the first studies of these cluster 
structure and relative stability [14] or in Tight Binding Molecular Dynamics simulations 
[15]. Also, the standard of precision is reduced when interested in integrated quantities 
(over  b ,  over  the  final  states  of  ionization  or  excitation,  over  the  orientation  of  the 
object) as seen before in the case of H2. 
 
III-Confrontation to experiment  
 

We compare predictions of the model to experiments performed with small ionic 
+ (n≤5) colliding with helium atoms at a constant impact velocity of 
carbon clusters Cn
2.6 atomic units (au). The experiments have been performed at the Tandem facility in 
Orsay  (France)  with  beams  of  accelerated  clusters.  All  details  about  the  experimental 
set-up and analysis method have been given in previous papers [1,16]. 
 
1-Ionization cross sections of small ionic carbon clusters 
 

Experimental cross sections are presented in figure 1 as a function of the cluster 
size n, together with predictions of the IAE model. As explained in [17], various lines 
corresponding  to  different  normalisations  of  the  theory  to  the  experimental  C+->He 
point are presented. The overall size dependence of the cross sections are relatively well 
reproduced by the model in all cases, in particular the large enhancement of the double 
ionization cross section when going from n=1 to n=2.  

 

2-Excitation cross sections of small ionic carbon clusters; energy deposit  
 

In  figure  2  results  concerning  electronic  excitation  of  Cn

+  in  the  same  systems 
are  presented:  experimental  cross  sections  refer  to  the  dissociative  part  of  the  cross 
section  whereas  the  IAE  model  is  done  for  the  total  excitation  cross  section.  As  for 
ionization,  classical  trajectory  Monte  Carlo  (CTMC)  calculations  were  performed  for 
excitation  of  the  C+  ion.  Contrary  to  ionization,  no  measurement  exists  yet  for  the 
excitation  of  C+  in  the  C+->He  collision  so  that  this  theoretical  calculation  was 
introduced  directly  into  the  model  in  order  to  predict  excitation  of  heavier  systems 
(solid  line).  Here  again,  a  reasonable  agreement  is  found.  In  order  to  interpret  the 
fragmentation  of  the  excited  clusters  ([1,18]  and  to  be  published),  a  calculation  of 
energy deposit has been performed within the IAE model, which is presented in figure 3 
+. Note that we calculate here, contrary to what is derived in stopping 
for the case of C5
power  calculations,  the  energy  due  to  electronic  excitation  only  (without  ionization). 
Interpretation  of  the  experimental  fragmentation  data  will  associate  this  energy 
distribution (to which 3eV of vibrational energy of the cluster in the entrance channel 
has to be added [16]) to predictions of a statistical fragmentation theory [19].

Abstract  

Tsallis [1] identified a set of numbers, the “q-triplet” ≡ {qstat,  qsen, qrel },  for a system 

described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. The deviation of the q’s from unity is a 

measure of the departure from thermodynamic equilibrium. We present observations of 

the q-triplets derived from two sets of daily averages of the magnetic field strength B 

observed by Voyager 1 in the solar wind near 40 A.U. during 1989 and near 85 A.U. 

during 2002, respectively. The results for 1989 do not differ significantly from those for 

2002. We find qstat = 1.75 ± 0.06, qsen = -0.6 ± 0.2, and qrel = 3.8 ± 0.3.

1. Introduction. 

Tsallis [1] discussed a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs (B-G) statistical mechanics, a 

nonextensive statistical mechanics, which has applications to many complex physical 

systems that are not in thermal equilibrium [2], [3] and [4]. A principal result [5] is the 

derivation of a probability distribution function (PDF), a “q-exponential function”  

expq[β x] ≡ [1 + (1 -  q) β x]1/(1 –  q), from a new entropy principle and two constraints. 

The entropic parameter q in the PDF describes the nonextensivity of the system. When  

q = 1, the PDF of Tsallis statistical mechanics reduces to the Boltzmann-Gibbs 

distribution. 

Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics has the following characteristics [1]. (1) The B-G 

PDF is an exponential function of energy describing a thermal equilibrium state 

characterized by the temperature T. (2) B-G statistics is related to exponential sensitivity 

to the initial conditions (strong chaos, described by an exponential growth characterized 

by one or more positive Lyapunov exponents). (3) B-G statistics is associated with the 

exponential relaxation of macroscopic quantities to thermal equilibrium (exponential 

decay with a relaxation time τ). Tsallis [1] suggested that, by analogy with B-G statistical 

mechanics, nonextensive statistical mechanics has the following characteristics. (1) The 

PDF is a q-exponential distribution describing a metastable or quasi-stationary state with 

the parameter q ≡ qstat. (2) Such a system is related to q-exponential sensitivity to the 

initial conditions (weak chaos, described by a q-exponential growth characterized by zero 

Lyapunov exponents and a growth parameter qsen.). (3) Tsallis statistics is associated with 

the q-exponential relaxation of macroscopic quantities to thermal equilibrium

(exponential decay with a relaxation parameter qrel). In general, the metastable state is 

characterized by a “q-triplet”, {qstat,  qsen, qrel } ≠ {1, 1, 1} where qstat > 1,  qsen < 1, and 

qrel > 1.  Ultimately, the system might relax to a state with {qstat,  qsen, qrel } = {1, 1, 1}, 

corresponding to the B-G thermal equilibrium state. To the best of our knowledge, 

observations of the q-triplet for a physical system have not yet been published.  

The atmosphere of the Sun beyond a few solar radii (the heliosphere) is fully ionized 

plasma expanding at supersonic speeds, carrying solar magnetic fields with it [6] and [7]. 

This “solar wind” is a driven nonlinear non-equilibrium system. The Sun injects matter, 

momentum, energy and magnetic fields into the heliosphere in a highly variable way. At 

the orbit of Earth (1 A.U.), the fluctuations in speed V and magnetic field strength B are 

large. As a result of nonlinear interactions, the fluctuations in B grow in size and 

amplitude with increasing distance from the Sun out to a distance of 5 – 30 A.U. [8].  

MHD simulations [9] and [10] show that between ≈40 A.U. and ≈90 A.U. (the “distant 

heliosphere”), the fluctuations can relax slowly, and the solar wind can be in a quasi-

stationary, metastable state.  

At 1 A.U., the fluctuations in B have a symmetric Tsallis distribution on scales from 1 

hour to 128 days [11]. These results indicate that nonextensive statistical mechanics is 

useful for describing the solar wind and states of the heliosphere. Fluctuations in V and B 

in the solar wind, often have fractal and multifractal scaling structure over a large range 

of scales in the region from 1 – 85 A.U. [12] and [8]. This type of scaling represents a 

hierarchical structure in phase space, in contrast to the uniformly occupied phase space of 

 

 

 

3

Boltzmann-Gibbs (B-G) statistical mechanics. The multifractal spectrum of the 

fluctuations in B observed near 85 A.U. during 2002 is very similar to that observed near 

40 A.U. during 1989 [12] and [13] suggesting the existence of a quasi-stationary, 

metastable state organized about a multifractal attractor in the phase space of the distant 

heliosphere, far from the driving source. 

The aim of this paper is to determine the q-triplet for the solar wind in the distant 

heliosphere and to compare the properties of this q-triplet with those expected for a quasi-

stationary metastable dynamical system described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. 

 

2. Analysis and results 

The Voyager 1 (V1) observations of daily averages of B for 1989 and 2002 made 

between 36.3 to 38.8 A.U. (≈40 A.U.) and between 83.4 to 86.9 A.U. (≈85 A.U.), 

respectively, are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively. Two features of these time 

series are of particular significance: the presence of large amplitude fluctuations in B on a 

wide range of scales, and the occurrence of many large abrupt jumps in B.  

The value of qstat is derived from a PDF. The large multiscale fluctuations in B can be 

described by the PDFs of dBn(ti) ≡ B(ti + τn) – B(ti) on scales τn = 2n days, where n = 0, 

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, i.e., scales from 1 to 128 days. The observed PDFs for the 1989 and 

2002 are shown by the symbols in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. The PDFs in each 

figure are displaced vertically relative to one another by a factor of 100 for clarity.  The 

solid curves are fits of the observed PDFs to the Tsallis q-exponential distribution,

Aq × expq[-βq (dBn)2] ≡  Aq ×  [1 - (1 - q) βq (dBn)2]1/(1 – q)                           (1) 

where q ≡ qstat  is the “entropic” or “nonextensivity” factor, -∞ < qstat ≤ 3 [5] and [11].   

The Tsallis q-exponential distribution fits all of the observed PDFs in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 

very well, on scales from 1 to 128 days, at heliospheric distances of 40 and 85 A.U., and 

during the years 1989 and 2002. This result supports the hypothesis that the distant 

heliosphere might be in a state described by the nonextensive statistical mechanics of 

Tsallis.  

The PDFs in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 range from kurtotic distributions at small scales (with large 

tails related to jumps in B) toward a B-G distribution at the largest scales (which would 

appear as a parabolic curve on the semilog plots in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3).  From a fit of the 

Tsallis distribution to the observations with τ = 1 day we obtain qstat = 1.72 ± 0.06 and 

qstat = 1.77 ± 0.06 for the 1989 and 2002 observations, respectively. The two values of 

qstat are the same within the uncertainties, but one cannot exclude the possibility of a 

small systematic change from ≈40 A.U. to ≈85 A.U. As a representative value we take 

qstat = 1.75 ± 0.06. 

The value of qsen can be derived from the multifractal spectrum f(α) obtained from B(t). 

The sensitivity to initial conditions of one-dimensional nonlinear maps is described by 

the q-exponential distribution with q = qsen (rather than the exponential distribution for 

strong chaos and mixing), which implies a power law sensitivity when qsen ≠ 1. The 

multifractal structure of the critical attractor is given by the multifractal spectrum f(α), 

 

 

 

 

5

whose end points αmin and αmax (where f(α) = 0) are the singularity strengths where the 

measure is most (least) concentrated, respectively.  A relation between qsen and 

multifractality in dissipative systems [14] is 

1/(1 - qsen) = 1/αmin – 1/αmax                                                    (2) 

The daily averages of B observed by V1 during 2002 (1989) have a multifractal structure 

in the range of scales from ≈2 to 16 days (≈2 to 32 days) [12, 13].  The measured values 

of (αi, fi) for 1989 and 2002 are reproduced in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), respectively. In 

order to determine αmin and αmax it is necessary to fit the observations with some function 

and extrapolate to f(α) = 0. The uncertainties in αmin and αmax determine the uncertainty 

in qsen, but these uncertainties are largely determined by the choice of the function f(α) 

used to fit the data. The theoretical form of f(α) is not known, although one expects it to 

be a concave function with a single maximum [15]. A quadratic function, shown by the 

curves in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b), provides a good fit to the observations, but the fit is not 

unique. A cubic fit also provides a good fit to both sets of the observations over the 

observed range of alpha, but extrapolation of the cubic gives an unphysical inflection 

point for α > 1. Two quadratic functions, one for α > 1 and another for α < 1, are also 

consistent with each of the data sets. Based on these and other fitting functions we 

estimate the following: 1) fmax= 1.02 ± 0.06 at α = 1.02 ± 0.02; 2) αmin = 0.70 ± 0.06 for 

the 1989 data and 0.76 ± 0.06 for the 2002 data; and 3) αmax = 1.4 ± 0.1 for the 1989 data 

and 1.4 ± 0.1 for the 2002 data. Thus, the observations of αmin and αmax for the 1989 data 

are the same as those for the 2002 data, within the uncertainties, consistent with a quasi-

stationary metastable state of the heliosphere between 40 and 85 A.U. The quadratic fit in 

Fig. 4(a) is broader than that in Fig. 4(b), but this difference is not significant within the 

 

6

uncertainties. From (2) one obtains qsen = -0.4 ± 0.2 for 1989, qsen = -0.7 ± 0.2 for 2002. 

We take as a representative value for the distant heliosphere qsen = -0.6 ± 0.2. 

The value of qrel can be determined from a scale-dependent correlation coefficient C(τ) 

defined as follows:  

C(τ)  ≡ <[B(ti + τ) - <B(ti)>] × [B(ti) - <B(ti)>)]>/<[(B(ti) - <B(ti)>]2>      (3) 

 

 

 

In general, one expects C(τ) to evolve with distance from the Sun and to be a function of 

the solar cycle. In classical B-G statistical processes this correlation coefficient tends to 

decrease exponentially with increasing τ, but for Tsallis statistics it should decay as a 

power law for some range of lags. In the latter case, log C(τ) = a + s log τ, where the 

slope s = 1/(1 - qrel), and qrel describes a relaxation process [16]. We find that C(τ) does 

decreases exponentially with increasing τ near the Sun, at 1 A.U.. However, at ≈40 A.U. 

(1989) and ≈85 A.U. (2002), C(τ) decreases as a power law with increasing τ over a 

certain range, as shown in Fig. 5(a) and Fig. 5(b), respectively. The solid lines in Fig. 5(a) 

and Fig. 5(b) show a power law decay on scales from 1 to 8 days, giving qrel = 4.1 and 3.5 

for 1989 and 2002, respectively. A straight line also provides relatively good fits to the 

data on scales from 1 to 16 days, giving qrel = 3.9 and 3.5 for 1989 and 2002, 

respectively. The uncertainties in qrel depend primarily on the range over which one fits 

the observations. As a representative value of qrel in the distant heliosphere we take qrel = 

3.8 ± 0.3.

3. Conclusions 

In summary, using in situ measurements in the distant heliosphere we calculated the q-

triplet of nonextensive statistical mechanics {qstat, qsen, qrel}. We estimate all three “q”s 

from the magnetic field strength observations made by V1 at ≈ 40 A.U. during 1989 and 

at ≈ 85 A.U. during 2002. The same results (within the uncertainties) were obtained for 

both sets of data, supporting the hypothesis that the distant heliosphere tends to be in a 

quasi-stationary metastable state. We found that qstat = 1.7 ± 0.06, qsen = -0.6 ± 0.2, and qrel 

= 3.8 ± 0.3.

Abstract 
Previous research indicates that after standard instruction students at all academic 
levels  often  construct  a  conceptual  framework  in  which  the  ideas  of  absolute 
simultaneity  and  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  co-exist.  This article describes the 
development  and  assessment  of  instructional  materials  intended  to  improve 
student  understanding  of  the  concept  of  time  in  special  relativity,  the  relativity  of 
simultaneity, and the role of observers in inertial reference frames.  Results from 
pretests and post-tests are presented to demonstrate the effect of the curriculum in 
helping students deepen their understanding of these topics.  Excerpts from taped 
interviews  and  classroom  interactions  help  illustrate  the  intense  cognitive  conflict 
that  students  encounter  as  they  are  led  to  confront  the  incompatibility  of  their 
deeply-held beliefs about simultaneity with the results of special relativity.

observed  that  students  often  fail  to  interpret 
properly  the  “time  of  an  event”  and  the 
notion of “reference frame.”  Many thus do 
not come to an understanding of these basic 
ideas, let alone the classic paradoxes that are 
typically  used 
in  special 
relativity. 
  Therefore,  we  focus  tutorial 
instruction  on  helping  students  develop  the

required  for  resolving  one  of  the  standard 
paradoxes:  the ‘train paradox.’10

In this article, we describe a set of two 
tutorials,  entitled  Events  and  reference 
frames and Simultaneity.  The first is in the 
context  of  a  single 
frame.  
Students  are  guided  to  develop  the  basic

measure  the  time  of  a  single  distant  event.   
This forms the basis for defining a reference 
frame  as  a  system  of  intelligent  observers.   
The  tutorial  then  helps  students  extend  the 
intuitive  notion  of  whether  or  not  two  local 
events  are  simultaneous  by  having  them 
develop  a  definition  of  simultaneity  for 
events that have a spatial separation.11,12  In 
the  second  tutorial,  students  examine  the 
consequence  of  the  invariance  of  the  speed 
of

paradox.    They  are  led  to  recognize  that 
resolution  of 
the 
relativity  of  simultaneity  as  a  means  of 
preserving causality.  This tutorial reinforces 
the  equivalence  of  observers  in  a  given 
frame  in  determining  the  time  order  of 
events.    The  tutorial  concludes  by  helping 
students  apply  the  relativity  of  simultaneity 
to  other  contexts.    Students  take  about  two 
hours to work through the pair of tutorials.

content  of  the  tutorials  does  not  differ 
significantly  from  what  is  typically  taught  in 
a course on special relativity.  The approach 
taken,  however,  is  to  help  students  go 
through  the  reasoning  required  to  develop  a 
functional  understanding  of  the  relativity  of 
simultaneity.   

The tutorials described in this paper use 
a  variety  of  instructional  strategies.  One of 
these can be loosely characterized as a series 
of  steps:    elicit,  confront,  and  resolve.13

that exposes a tendency to make a particular

conceptual  difficulties  with  causality  and 
how  instruction  was  modified  to  address 
them.    The  assessment  of  effectiveness  in 
Section  VI reports results from pretests and 
from post-tests administered after all tutorial

IV. LAYING THE GROUNDWORK 
FOR ADDRESSING STUDENT 
DIFFICULTIES WITH 
REFERENCE FRAMES 

In  the  previous  article,  we  illustrated 
that  student  difficulties  with  the  relativity  of 
simultaneity  can  often  be  traced  to  beliefs 
about  measurements  of 
the 
meaning  of  reference  frames.1    We  found 
that  students  at  all  levels  tend  to  treat  the 
time  of  an  event  as  the  time  at  which  a 
signal  from  the  event  is  received  by  an 

time  and 

observer.    Thus,  they  consider  a  reference 
frame  as  being  location  dependent.5    The 
persistence  of  these  beliefs  about  time  and 
reference  frames  suggests  a  need  for 
instruction  that  provides  students  with  a 
strong foundation upon which they can draw 
in  their  study  of  special  relativity.    This  is 
the  approach  taken  in  the  tutorial,  Events 
and  reference  frames,  which  focuses  on 
time,  reference  frames,  and  simultaneity  in 
Galilean relativity.  

A.  Guiding students in the determination 

of the time of an event 

two  procedures  by  which 

The Events and reference frames tutorial 
begins  by  guiding  students  to  formulate 
appropriate procedures for the measurement 
of the time of an event.  In the first exercise, 
an  observer  wishes  to  know  the  time  at 
which a beeper beeps but is constrained to a 
location far from the beeper.  The observer 
is  equipped  with  accurate meter sticks, and 
synchronized clocks, and has assistants who 
can  help.    The  tutorial  asks  students  to 
describe 
the 
observer can determine the time at which the 
beeper  beeps:    (i) using  knowledge  of  the 
speed  of  sound  in  air  and  (ii)  without 
knowing  or  measuring  the  speed  of  sound 
first.    In  this  way  students  articulate  for 
themselves  two  operational  definitions  for 
the  time  of  a  distant  event:    (i) an observer 
may  record  the  time  of  arrival  of  the  sound 
from  an  object,  measure  the distance to the 
object, and correct for the signal travel time, 
or (ii) an observer may place an assistant at 
the  object  and  have  the  assistant  mark  the 
time  at  which  it  makes  a  sound.    The 
exercise  builds  on  student  understanding  of 
the  finite  nature  of signal travel time which, 
as  we  observed  during  the  investigation 
discussed  in  the  previous  paper,  generally 
appears to be good. 

B.  Guiding students in the construction 

of a reference frame  

In  a  subsequent  exercise,  students 
generalize  their  measurement  procedure for 
the  time  of  an  event.    They  are  asked  to 
devise  an  arrangement  of  observers  and

time  of  an  arbitrary  event.    The  term 
reference frame is introduced to describe the 
system  of  observers.    The  term  “intelligent 
observer”  is  defined  as  an  observer  who 
takes into account signal travel time. 

C.  Guiding students in the definition of

After  students  have  constructed  the 
concept  of  a  “reference  frame,”  they  are 
asked to apply it.  The context is one that we 
have found can elicit the belief that the time

frame” is the order in which signals from the

Students  are  told  that  a  horn  is  pla ced 
between  an  observer  and  a  distant  beeper.   
The observer hears a honk and a beep at the 
same  instant.    Students  are  asked  two 
questions.  The first is to describe a method 
by which the observer can measure the time 
separation  between  the  emission  of  the two 
sounds 
in  his  reference  frame  without 
knowing  or  measuring  the  speed  of  sound 
first.    They  are  also  asked  whether,  in  the 
observer’s reference frame, the beeper beeps 
before, after, or at the same time as the horn 
honks.  Students use the idea of a reference 
frame  and  the  definition  of  the  time  of  an 
event  to  conclude  that,  in  order  for  the 
signals to reach the observer simultaneously, 
the  more  distant  event  must  have  occurred 
first.    The  pair  of  questions  helps  students

A.  Guiding students in applying the 
invariance of the speed of light 

After 

traditional 

instruction,  most 
students  can  state  that  the  speed  of  light is 
the  same  in  all  directions  in  all  reference 
frames.    We  have  found  during  instruction, 
however,  that  few  students  have  the  ability 
to  use  this  knowledge  to  analyze  relativistic 
scenarios. 

Single flash of light 

The  Simultaneity 

tutorial  begins  by 
helping  students  apply  the  invariance  of  the 
speed  of  light  to  a  simple  physical  situation:   
the  isotropic  propagation  of  the  wavefront 
from  a  single  flash  of  light  as  analyzed  in 
two reference frames.  Students are told that 
two  observers,  Alan  and  Beth,  move  past 
each  other  at  relativistic  relative  speed.  At 
the instant they pass, a spark occurs between 
them, emitting a flash of light.  Students are 
shown  a  cross-sectional diagram for Alan’s 
frame  representing  Alan,  Beth,  and  a 
spherical  wavefront  of  light  a  short  time 
after  the  spark  occurs.    They  are  asked  to 
identify

illustrate  the  fact  that  the  speed  of  light  is 
the same in all directions according to Alan.  
They  are  then  asked  to  sketch  a  diagram 
corresponding to a short time later in Alan’s 
frame.    Most  students  recognize  that  a 
spherical wavefront shows the speed of light 
to be the same in all directions and sketch a 
larger  sphere  to  represent  the  wavefront  at 
the  later  time.    (See  Fig. 1(a)  for  correct 
diagrams.) 
The students then sketch similar diagrams in 
Beth’s reference frame.  To do so, they need 
to  recognize  that  Beth  also  observes  the

Two flashes of light (train paradox) 

In  the  next  part  of  the  tutorial,  students 
begin to analyze a version of the classic train 
paradox, which involves two flashes of light.  
The paradox is summarized below. 
Description of train paradox 

Two  flashes  of  lightning  strike  the  ends 
of  a  train  that  is  moving  with  uniform 
velocity.    Both  occur  at  the  same  time 
according  to  an  observer  at  rest  on  the 
ground.    In  the  ground  frame,  the  observer 
notes  that  the  train  is  moving  toward  the 
origin  of  one  of  the  flashes.    The  observer 
therefore concludes that the wavefronts from

wavefront  hits  an  observer  at  the  center  of  the 
train  before,  after,  or  at  the  same  instant  as  the 
rear wavefront. 

the two flashes reach the center of the train 
at  different  times.    The  observer  then 
imagines the situation in the reference frame 
of  the  train,  in  which  the  train  is  stationary.   
Knowing  that  the  propagation  of  light  is 
isotropic  in  all  frames,  the  observer  reasons 
that  since  the  wavefronts  would  travel  the 
same  distance  from  the  ends  of  the  train  to 
the center, they would reach the center at the 
same  time.    Thus,  the  predictions  about  the 
order  in  which  the  wavefronts  reach  the 
center of the train seem to be different in the 
two frames. 

The  resolution  of  the  apparent  paradox 
is to conclude that the flashes of lightning at 
the ends of the train are not simultaneous in 
the  train  frame.    The  lightning  strike  at  the 
front  of  the  train  must  occur  first  and  the 
wavefronts  from  the  two  flashes  do  not 
reach the center of the train at the same time 
in either frame.  In this way, the relativity of

simultaneity  is  seen  to  be  a  consequence  of 
the invariance of the speed of light. 
Description of tutorial sequence on the train 
paradox 

The original version of the train paradox 
used  in  tutorial  differs  slightly  from  the  one 
described above.  Students are told that two 
sparks  occur  at  either  end  of  a  train  that 
moves  with  relativistic  speed  relative  to  the 
ground.  The sparks leave char marks on the 
ground and on the train.14  The ground-based 
observer,  Alan,  who  is  at  rest  midway 
between  the  marks  on  the  ground,  receives 
the wavefronts from the sparks at the same 
time.  (See Fig. 2(a).)  

Analysis in ground frame:  Students are 
asked  to  draw  a  dia gram  for  the  ground 
frame that shows the wavefront of light from 
each  spark  shortly  after  the  sparks  occur.   
They  are  guided  to  recognize  that  the 
wavefronts  from  both  sparks  are  spheres 
centered  on  the  char  marks  on  the  ground 
(since  the  propagation  of  light  is  isotropic) 
and that they are the same size in the ground 
frame  (since  they  reach  Alan  at  the  same 
time). 
  Students  are  then  told  that  an 
observer,  Beth,  is  standing  at  the  center  of 
the train.  They are asked whether, in Alan’s 
reference frame, Beth receives the wavefront 
from  the  front  spark  (wavefront  F)  before, 
after,  or  at  the  same  time  as  the  wavefront 
from  the  rear  spark  (wavefront  R).    Most 
students 
receives 
wavefront  F  before  wavefront  R  since  in 
Alan’s  frame  she  is  moving  toward  the 
center  of  the  front  wavefront.    A  correct 
diagram  for  the  situation  in  Alan’s  frame  is 
shown in Fig. 2(b). 

that  Beth 

recognize 

Analysis  in  train  frame:   The students 
are next asked to determine the order of the 
events in the train frame.  A correct answer 
involves  recognizing  that  in  the  train  frame, 
as  in  the  ground  frame,  Beth  receives 
wavefront  F  before  wavefront  R.    In  the 
train  frame,  the  train  is  at  rest  and  thus  the 
wavefronts  from  the  sparks  are  spheres 
centered on the char marks at the ends of the 
train.    Since  wavefront  F  reaches  Beth’s 
location  first  in  her  frame,  and  in  her  frame 

she  is  equidistant  from  the  event  locations, 
the front spark must occur first in her frame.

indicate 

We  had  not  anticipated  the  extent  to 
which  the  transition  from  the  ground  frame 
to  the  train  frame  would  be  challenging  for 
students.  Our observations of students in the 
classroom,  however, 
the 
transition  is  very  difficult for students when 
they are required to construct the resolution 
of  the  paradox  themselves.    Most  students 
answer  (correctly)  that,  in  Alan’s  reference 
frame,  the  wavefronts  from  the  two  sparks 
reach  Beth  at  different  times.    They  then 
answer (incorrectly) that, in Beth’s reference 
frame, the wavefronts reach her at the same 
time.    This  is  the  essence  of  the  paradox 
  However,  very  few 
discussed  above. 
students recognize an inconsistency in these 
two answers.  Most students simply move on 
to subsequent activities in the tutorial.  They 
do  not  see  the  logical  necessity  of  the 
relativity  of  simultaneity  and  thus  do  not 
confront  their  belief  that  simultaneity  is 
absolute. 

in  all 

The  answers  given  by  the  students 
indicate  a  failure  to  recognize  that  two 
events  that  occur  at  a  single  location  (e.g., 
the receptions of two flashes by Beth) must 
have  the  same  time  order  in  all  reference 
frames.  The preservation of the order of the 
receptions  of  the  wavefronts  in  the  two 
frames  is  implicit  in  the  resolution  of  the 
train paradox given above.  The requirement 
that the two flashes reach Beth in the same 
order 
is  a 
reference 
consequence  of  causality.    [If  the  time  (dt) 
between  two  events  is  sufficient  for  a  light 
signal  to  propagate  between  their  locations 
(dx), i.e., c2 > dx2/dt2 or ds2 = c2dt2 – dx2 > 0, 
then those events have a time-like separation 
and 
relationship.  
Therefore,  the  time  order  in  which  they 
occur must be the same in all frames.  If the 
time  order  could  be  reversed  or  made  zero 
then the ‘result’ could precede the ‘cause.’]

reception of the wavefronts by Beth have a 
time-like  separation  in  the  ground  frame 
they  occur  in  the  same  order  in  all  frames 
and cannot be simultaneous in any frame. 

We  decided  to  modify  the  tutorial  to 
help  students  recognize  the  ‘paradox’  in  the 
train paradox.  The approach we took was to 
shift  the  focus  from  the  time  order  of  two 
events (the reception of each wavefront) to 
whether or not a single event occurs.15  

1.  Eliciting difficulties with causality 

In the modified tutorial, students are told 
that Beth has a tape player that operates as 
follows.  When wavefront F reaches the tape 
player, it starts to play music at top volume.  
When  wavefront  R  reaches  it,  the  tape 
player is silenced.  If both wavefronts reach 
the  tape  player  at  the  same  instant,  it 
remains  silent.    Students  are  asked  whether 
the tape player plays (i) in Alan’s frame and 
(ii) in Beth’s frame.  The analysis in Alan’s 
frame  (described  above)  shows  that  Beth 
receives  wavefront  F  before  wavefront  R, 
and  thus  the  tape  player  plays.    Causality 
requires  that  the  tape  player  plays  in  the 
train frame as well.   

the

The  tape  player  exercise  leads  students 
to recognize that different answers about the 
order in which Beth receives the wavefronts 
in 
in  different 
answers  about  whether  or  not  a  particular 
event  occurs.    We  found  that  the  exercise 
with  the  tape  player  helps  students  confront 
the 
train  paradox.  
However,  most  students  still have difficulty 
in  resolving  the  situation  on  their  own.  
Some  specific  difficulties  elicited  by  the 
modified tutorial are discussed below.

plays in the ground frame but not in the train 
frame.  For most students, belief in absolute 
simultaneity  seems  to  be  sufficiently  strong 
that  they  fail  to  consider  the  relativity  of 
simultaneity in resolving the paradox.   

Subsequent  questions  in  the  tutorial  ask 
whether  Beth  will  hear  the  music  and 
whether  Beth  will  later  observe  the  tape  to 
have  advanced  from  its  starting  position.16

•  Tendency to treat different frames 
of  reference  as  corresponding  to 
different objective realities 

A  common  response  by  students  is  to 
invent  an  “alternative  reality”  in  an  attempt 
to  reconcile  conflicting  ideas.    The  students 
in  the  following  exchange  brought  in  poorly-
understood  ideas  from  quantum  mechanics 
to  support  the  erroneous  idea  that  the 
cassette tape player both plays and does not 
play.20  [“I” indicates the instructor.] 

S1:  Wait, so Alan hears it and Beth 
doesn’t?    That’s  one  awesome

telling  us  last  week.    That  in

In  a  course  for  high  school  teachers,  a 
student  and  the  instructor  came  up  with  a 
modified  scenario:    If,  in  Beth’s  frame,  she 
encounters the front wavefront first, then her 
hat flies out of the train and Alan picks it up 
and  wears 
  If  she  receives  both 
wavefronts at the same time, her hat remains 
on  her  head.    When  the  student  was  asked 
how  many  hats  would  be  present  during 
Alan’s  and  Beth’s  reunion,  he  replied

acquiescence of the student’s partner further 
confirmed  for  us  the  suspicion  that  students 
do  not  recognize  the  crucial  choice  to  be 
made:    allow  events  to  occur  in  one  frame 
and  not  in  another  (a  violation  of  causality) 
or  abandon  absolute  simultaneity.    They  act 
as  if  the  former  were  the  only  possible

The  failure  to  consider  the  possibility

prevalent  among  students  who  had  or  had

recognized  the  implications  of  the  relativity

In  working

described  above,  many  students  start  to

in  a  profound  way.    They  need  practice,

1.  Addressing the belief that every 
observer constitutes a different 
reference frame 

We have found that it is crucial to have 
students  reexamine  their  earlier  conclusions 
about  the  meaning  of  reference  frame  in 
their  new  understanding  of 
light  of 
simultaneity. 
  The  tutorial  describes  an 
additional  observer,  Becky,  at  rest  on  the 
rear  of  the  train  and  asks  whether,  in 
Becky’s  frame,  the  front  spark  occurs 
before, after, or at the same time as the rear 
spark.  Students recognize that even though 
Becky sees wavefront R first, wavefront F is 
created first in her frame as it is in Beth’s. 

2.  Applying the relativity of 

simultaneity in new contexts 

The ideas developed in the Simultaneity 
tutorial  are  counterintuitive.    The  tutorial 
helps students deepen their understanding by 
applying these concepts in a variety of other 
situations.

the  rods  have  different  lengths  in the frame 
of the other rod.  They are led to recognize 
that  the  two  events  corresponding  to  the

Below,  we  discuss  results  from 
questions 
that  have  been  administered 
before and after tutorial instruction to assess 
student  understanding  of  time,  reference 
frames,  and  simultaneity.22 
  On  each 
question,  student  performance  in  different 
courses  at  the  same  le vel  was  similar.  
Therefore,  in  the  following  discussion,  the 
results have been combined.  No student saw 
the  same  version  of  any  question  as  both  a 
pretest and post-test. 

 

A.  Assessing student understanding of 
reference frames:  Seismologist 
question 

As  discussed  previously,  students  often 
fail  to  treat  a  reference  frame  as  a  set  of 
observers  who  agree  on  the  time  order  of 
events.    One question that we have used in 
our  investigation  examines  whether  or  not 
students  distinguish  the  time  order  of  two 
distant  events  from  the  time  order  in  which 
an observer receives signals from the events.  
Many  versions  have  been  given.    They  are

1.  Description of the question 

In 

the  Seismologist  question, 

two 
volcanoes,  Mt. Rainier 
and  Mt. Hood, 
suddenly  erupt  and  a  seismologist  at  rest 
midway between them sees the eruptions at 
the  same  instant.    A  second  observer  (the 
“assistant”) is at rest relative to the ground at 
the base of Mt. Rainier.  Students are asked 
whether  Mt. Rainier  erupts  before,  after,  or 
at  the  same  instant  as  Mt. Hood  in  the 
reference frame of the assistant. 

To  answer  correctly,  students  must  be 
able  to  apply  the  definition  of  simultaneity 
and understand the role of a reference frame 
in  establishing  a  common  time  coordinate 
for observers at rest relative to one another.  
The  seismologist  is  equidistant  from  the 
mountains, so the signal travel times are the 
same  and  thus  occurred  at  the  same  time.   
Since  both  observers  are  in  the  same 
reference  frame,  they  obtain  the  same 
answer for the order of the eruptions. 

Two  volcanoes,  Mt.  Rainier  and  Mt.  Hood, 
are  300  km  apart  in  their  rest  frame.    Each 
erupts  suddenly  in  a  burst  of  light.    A 
seismologist  at  rest  in  a  laboratory  midway 
between  the  volcanoes  receives  the  light 
signals from the volcanoes at the same time.  
The  seismologist’s  assistant  is  at  rest  in  a 
lab at the base of Mt. Rainier.* 

Define  Event  1  to  be  “Mt.  Rainier erupts,” 
and Event 2 to be “Mt. Hood erupts.”

The  most  common  incorrect  answer  is 
that  the  events  are  not  simultaneous  for  the 
assistant.  This response is consistent with a 
belief  that  the  time  order  of  events  depends 
on  the  order  in  which  an  observer  receives 
signals  from  the  events.    In  effect,  the 
students  treat  observers  at  rest  relative  to

B.  Assessing student understanding of 

the relativity of simultaneity:  
Spacecraft question 

Some of the questions used to assess the 
effectiveness  of  the  tutorials  allow  us  to 

probe the extent to which students can apply 
the  relativity  of  simultaneity.    One  such 
question, entitled the  Spacecraft question, is 
discussed below. 

1.  Description of the question 

The  Spacecraft  question  involves  two 
volcanoes, Mt. Rainier and Mt. Hood, which 
to  an 
simultaneously  according 
erupt 
observer  at  rest  on  the  ground  midway 
between  them.    The  question  states  that  a 
spacecraft  is  flying  at  relativistic  velocity 
from  Mt. Rainier  to  Mt. Hood  and  is  over 
Mt. Rainier  at  the  instant  it  erupts.    The 
eruption  events  are  explicitly 
labeled 
Event 1  (Mt. Rainier  erupts)  and  Event  2 
(Mt. Hood  erupts).    Students  are  asked 
whether,  in  the  reference  frame  of  the 
spacecraft, Event 1 occurs before, after, or at 
the same time as Event 2. 

A  correct  answer  can  be  obtained 
through the use of qualitative or quantitative 
reasoning or from a spacetime diagram.  The 
following  is  an  example  of  a  qualitative 
argument that we accept as correct.  In the 
spacecraft  frame,  the  locations at which the 
eruptions  occur  are  stationary.    We  can 
imagine  these  as  the  centers  of  wavefronts 
of light from the eruptions.  According to an 
observer in the spacecraft, the ground-based 
observer is moving away from the center of

same time in the reference frame of a 
seismologist at rest in a laboratory midway 
between the volcanoes.  A fast spacecraft 
flying with constant speed v = 0.8c from 
Rainier toward Hood is directly over Mt. 
Rainier when it erupts.   

Let Event 1 be “Mt Rainier erupts,” and 
Event 2 be “Mt. Hood erupts.” 

In the reference frame of the spacecraft, does 
Event 1 occur before, after, or at the same 
time as Event 2?  Explain your reasoning.

center of the flash from Mt. Rainier.  Thus, 
in  the  spacecraft  frame,  the  ground-based 
observer is closer to the center of the signal 
from Mt. Rainier at the instant that observer 
receives  both  signals.    In  the  spacecraft 
frame therefore, Mt. Hood erupted first since 
its signal travels farther in order to reach the 
ground-based  observer  at  the  same  time  as 
the  signal  from  Mt.  Rainier.    A  correct 
answer  can  also  be  obtained  using  the

the first explosion occurs at the left end of

Is there a reference frame in which the two

1.  Description of the question 

In the  Explosions question, an explosion 
occurs at each end of a landing strip with a 
proper length of 3000 m.  In the frame of an 
engineer at rest on the strip, the explosion at 
the  right  end  occurs  a  time  dt  after  the 
explosion  on  the  left  end  (where  cdt  = 
1200 m).   Students are asked whether there 
is  a  frame  in  which  the  explosions  are 
simultaneous,  and  if  so,  to  determine  the 
velocity of that frame relative to the landing 
strip. 

A correct answer can be  found through 
use  of  the  Lorentz  transformations.    The 
spatial  separation  between  the  explosions 
(dx)  is  3000  m  and  the  time  separation  (dt) 
corresponds  to  1200  m.    Thus,  the  time 
duration between the explosions is zero in a 
frame  that  moves  from  left  to  right  with 
speed 0.4c.

VII. CONCLUSION 

The results of the investigation reported 
in  this  and  a  previous  article  indicate  that 
many students who study special relativity at 
the  undergraduate  to  graduate  levels  fail  to 
develop a functional understanding.  Even in 
advanced  courses,  students  often  do  not 
special 
recognize

topics,  we

difficulties with this material could be traced 
to  a  lack  of  understanding  of  more  basic, 
underlying concepts.27

In the two articles, we have shown how, 
through  research,  we  were  able  to  identify 
some conceptual hurdles that hinder students 
from  applying  basic  kinematical  concepts  to 
the  complex  situations  encountered 
in 
special relativity.  After standard instruction 
many  students  lack  operational  definitions 
for  such  fundamental  ideas  as  time  of  an 
event,  simultaneity,  and  reference  frame  – 
concepts  that  should  be  familiar  to  them 
from Galilean relativity.  We have illustrated 
how  the  results  from  research  guided  us  in 
designing  two  tutorials  (part  of  a  larger  set 
on  relativity)  that  help  students  develop  a 
sound  understanding  of  these  basic  ideas.  
Students  who  had  worked  through  these

special relativity. 

materials 

In  the  traditional  approach,  paradoxes 
are  often  used  as  elicitation  activities  or 
motivational  tools.    However,  a  strategy in 
which  the  instructor  elicits  and  exposes 
student beliefs to generate cognitive conflict 
and then resolves the paradox is inadequate.  
Our  experience  indicates  that  confrontation 
and  resolution  must  be  carried  out  by  the 
students,  not  by  the  instructor, if meaningful 
learning  is  to  take  place.    This  strategy  is 
especially  crucial  when  the  ideas  are  as 
strongly  counterintuitive  as 
special 
relativity.

important  to  separate,  as  Einstein  did  in  his 
1905  paper,  local  from  distant  simultaneity.  
(See  the  article  in  Ref. 5.)  Two distant events 
are  defined  to  be  simultaneous  if  their  time 
coordinates  in  a  specific  reference  frame  are 
identical. 
  This  definition  presupposes  a 
definition  for  the  time  coordinate  of  a  single 
event  in  a  reference  frame.    This  is  most 
naturally  defined  as  the  reading  on  a  clock 
located at the event’s position “at the instant at 
which the event occurs.”  The concept of local 
simultaneity  (the  identification  of  the  time  of 
the event in question with the time that a local 
clock  reads  “at  that  instant”)  is  assumed, 
therefore, to be a notion that does not require 
definition.

particular  clock  reading  for  an  event  as  the 
time  coordinate  of  the  event  throughout  a

consistent with those described in other texts.

19 The  conversation  took  place  in  a  course  for 
prospective high school science teachers.  S1 
and  S3  are  advanced  undergraduate  physics 
students; S2 is a first-year graduate student in 
physics.  The course used an adaptatio n of the 
tutorial  sequence  that  is  being  developed  for 
Physics  by 
laboratory-based 
curriculum 
the  preparation  of  K-12 
teachers.    (L.C.  McDermott  and  the  Physics

20  This  conversation  was  recorded  in  a  modern 
physics course in a California high school that 
served  as  a  pilot  site  for  the  Events  and 
reference frames and Simultaneity tutorials. 
21 The  interviews  are  discussed  in  Ref.  1.    In 
addition  to  serving  as  a  setting  for  probing 
student 
the 
interviews  often  helped  us  in  identifying 
contexts and lines of questioning that might be 
effective  as  instructional  strategies.    These 
were eventually incorporated in the Events and 
reference frames and Simultaneity tutorials.  
22 We have found each question to be useful in 
eliciting  specific  student  difficulties.    For  a 
detailed discussion about the development of 
the questions, see Ref. 1.

24  The  graduate  student  data  is  for  the  explicit 
version  of  the  Spacecraft  question,  which  is 
similar but not identical to the tutorial post-test 
(the  location-specific version).  See Ref.  1 for 
a  detailed  discussion  of  each  version  of  the 
Spacecraft question.

students  perform,  after  tutorial  instruction, as 
well  as  or  better  than  graduate  students 
without tutorial instruction, see  the last article 
in  Ref.  9.    See  also,  S. Vokos,  P.S.  Shaffer,

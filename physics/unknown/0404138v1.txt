Abstract.  A  Redfield-like  Liouville  equation  for  an  open  system  that  couples  to  one  or  more  leads  and  ex-
changes  particles  with  them  is  derived.  The  equation  is  presented  for  a  general  case.    A  case  study  of  time-
dependent transport through a single quantum level for varying electrostatic and chemical potentials in the leads 
is presented. For the case of varying electrostatic potentials the proposed equation yields, for the model study, 
the results of an exact solution. 

 

 

 

 

 

Introduction 

The  problem  of  transport  through  mesoscopic  or 
nano-devices  has  attracted  much  attention  lately  [1-15].  
Fundamentally, it is quite similar to the problem of an in-
teraction  of  a  system  with  a  bath  of  "other"  particles, 
whether  harmonic  or  not.  One  of  the  simplest  and  most 
general approaches for system-bath interactions is the Red-
field-Davies  approach  [16-17],  more  generally  known  as 
the  master-equation  technique  [10,13,18-24],  which  is 
suitable for particles which interact with weak baths.  The 
greatest strength of the Redfield-Davies approach is that it 
allows  the  solution  of  complicated  systems,  with  large 
baths.    

Transport,  however,  is  special.    Particle  transport 
inherently  is  associated  with  open  baths  (i.e.,  with  the 
transport  of  particles  from  one  bath  to  the  other).    In  this 
work  we  therefore  consider  the  equivalent  of  Redfield's 
equation  for  an  open  system  which  exchanges  particles 
with reservoirs: electronic transport through a nano-device 
(for an alternate, partial-trace-free approach, see Ref.[15]).   
We  derive  an equation for the one-particle density matrix 
which  has  an  added  source  term.  We  label  this  equation 
source-Redfield. 

The  source-Redfield  equation  is  suitable  both  for 
time-independent transport and for time-dependent studies; 
moreover, it can be extended to include other effects, such 
as  temperature,  pressure,  or  other  dissipative  mechanisms 
as  it  can  be  combined  with  the  original  Redfield-Davies 
theory  in  order  to  take  into  account  interaction  with  bos-
onic  “heat”  baths.    A  feature  which  is  not  used  here  but 
would  be  studied  in  further  work  is  the  extension  of  the 
method  to  deal  with  the  time-evolution  of  the  two-body 
density  matrix,  which  would  allow  the  studies  of  more 

complicated systems (where "system" is used generally to 
refer to the sub-system, i.e., the device between the leads).  
Obviously, the formalism is also valid for other cases, such 
as  the  interaction  of  a  small  adsorbate  with  a  single  lead 
(e.g., with a surface of a crystal or a metal). 

In Section II we derive the theory for a general case 
of  leads  with  varying  chemical  potentials  and/or  varying 
electrostatic  potentials  (i.e.,  varying  leads’  populations 
and/or  varying  leads’  energies).  Section III considers the 
kinetic limit of diagonal density matrix for the system, and 
compares, for the case of a system with a single quantum 
level, the results to that of a previous exact treatment. Dis-
cussion follows in Section IV. 

II. Derivation    

 

The  Hamiltonian  governing  the  total  system  (sys-
tem+leads)  is  a  combination  of  non-interacting  lead  and 
system Hamiltonians together with a coupling part,  ˆT  :

where  α is  an  index  over  the  leads.    Typically,  only  two 
leads would be used, denoted here as L and R, but the the-
ory is valid for any number of leads, including a single one 
for an adsorbate-surface study. The central meso- or nano-
system  can  be  a  single  molecule  or  a  more  complicated 
entity. 

The  Hamiltonian  of  the  system  is  the  sum  of  a  one-

body and two-body terms.

and the leads’ electrostatic potentials 
 (since only the 
energy difference matters, the electrostatic potential of the 
system  can  always  be  set  at  zero);  Α is  an  index  running 
over all the quantum states in all the reservoirs (i.e., leads); 
EΑ  is the energy of state  Α . The quantum numbers  Α  are 
not necessarily indices of plane-waves, and they could be, 
e.g.,  indices  of  Bloch  states  for  periodic  but  non-
homogenous leads.

Eq.(13)  relies  on  the  assumption  that  the  reservoirs 
are big enough to neglect the feedback action of the small 
system on them.  

Time  dependence  enters  the  problem  only  through 
the time variation of reservoirs.  This time variation can be  
physically produced, e.g.,  by coupling of the reservoirs to 
other,  bigger, external systems or bath fields.  In the pre-
sent  theoretical  model  the  reservoirs  vary in time through 
variation  of  phenomenological  parameters  describing  the 
reservoirs. Only one set of such parameters is usually used 
in  conductance  problems  -  electrostatic  potentials  in  the 
  in  the  for-
.  We  already  deal  with 
reservoirs, 
mulation.  However,  there  are  other  possibilities,  such  as 
pressure  change,  charging  the  reservoirs,  or  in  general  a 
change in the occupation numbers. Even though the reser-
voirs are not necessarily in chemical (and thermal) equilib-

rium,  for  brevity  we  refer  to  variation  of

In  deriving  Eq.(13),  the  two-operator  reservoirs’ 
quantum  averages  appear.  The  way  in  which  the  reser-
voirs’  quantum  averages  (defined  by  an  R  subscript)  are 
simplified can be seen in the following example:

However, relations (19) are correct only for “bare” opera-

account two-body interactions and interactions with reser-
voirs,  i.e.,  such  effects  as  level  mixing  and  phase  decay. 
The  correct  answer  can  be  obtained  by  substituting  the 
bare retarded and advanced Green functions of the system 
by dressed ones, i.e., by using the exact relations from the

Eqs.(16)-(17)  have  the  form  of  a  Liouville  von-
Neumann  equation  for  the  one-particle  density  matrix, 
with a complex Hamiltonian (due to the complexity of the 
Σ -terms  in  the  definition  of hρ and  hρ   in  Eqs.(17))  and 
an  additional  driving  (or  pumping)  source  term  D.  The 
complexity of the Hamiltonian results in attenuation of the 
one-particle  density  matrix  components  since  particles 
leave  the  system  to  the  reservoirs.  The  driving  term,  D, 
accounts for the absorption of particles from the reservoirs.

The Liouville equation with the source term combined 
with  the  equation  for  the  retarded  Green  function  (Eqs. 
(16)-(17) and (18)) is the main result of the paper. As soon 
as an approximate form of the dependence of the two-body 
self-energy  Ξ  on the one-particle density matrix  ρ  is cho-
sen,  i.e., 
,  the  equations  become  self-contained 
and can be propagated numerically.  It is interesting, how-
ever,  to  pursue  a  further  approximation  for  these  equa-
tions, in order to obtain an analytical expression. For that, 
we  first  ignore  two-body  interactions,  and  then  apply  the 
somewhat drastic kinetic assumption, i.e., assume that the 
coupling rate (defined later) is much smaller than the char-
acteristic energy difference within the system. This means 
that  the xE ’s  determine  the  largest  energy  scale  in  the 
problem and it is convenient to incorporate the phase evo-
lution associated with them into ρ by considering

the Keldysh diagrammatic approach. 

In  the  stationary  case,  the  electrostatic and chemical 
potentials  are  time-independent  and  one  obtains  the  usual 
result for a resonant-tunneling current: 

Our approach allows the reservoir populations to vary 
and  the  next  goal  it  to  compare  the  two  possible  ways  to 
view the reservoirs – as having varying electrostatic poten-
tials or varying chemical potentials.  But first consider the 
limit of slowly varying chemical or/and electrostatic poten-
tials  (slowly  with  respect  to  the  rate  Γ ).  The  func-

Interestingly, the difference between the two currents 
(due  to  varying  chemical  potentials  and  due  to  varying 
electrostatic  potentials  in  the  leads)  is  much  more  pro-
nounced  for  a  rectangular  pulse,  while  the  ac  response  is 
similar for both cases. Apparently, this is due to high fre-
quanecy  components  associated  with  instant  switching  on 
and off in the rectangular pulse. 

 

 

IV. Discussion and Conclusions 

In conclusion, we present a Redfield approach with a 
source  term  which  is  suitable  to  numerically  propagate 
transport  problem  under  different  bias  situation,  such  as 
time-dependent  electrostatic  bias,  time-dependent  charg-
ing, or in general time-dependent level energies and level 
populations in the leads.

The  resulting  equations  are  simple  to  propagate  even 
for  complicated  systems.  They  involve  a  two-time  kernel

ABSTRACT

The  response  kinetics  of  liquid  crystalline  phosphatidylcholine  bilayer  stacks  to  rapid,  IR-

laser  induced  temperature  jumps  has  been  studied  by  millisecond  time-resolved  x-ray

diffraction.  The  system  reacts  on  the  fast  temperature  change  by  a  discrete  bilayer

compression normal to its surface and a lateral bilayer expansion. Since water cannot diffuse

from the excess phase into the interbilayer water region within the 2 ms duration of the laser

pulse,  the  water  layer  has  to  follow  the  bilayer  expansion,  by  an  anomalous  thinning.

Structural  analysis  of  a  20  ms  diffraction  pattern  from  the  intermediate  phase  indicates  that

the  bilayer  thickness  remains  within  the  limits  of  isothermal  equilibrium  values.  Both,  the

intermediate structure and its relaxation into the original equilibrium La -phase, depend on the

visco-elastic properties of the bilayer/water system. We present an analysis of the relaxation

process  by  an  overdamped  one-dimensional  oscillation  model  revealing  the  concepts  of

Hooke's law for phospholipid bilayers on a supramolecular basis. The results yield a constant

bilayer repulsion and viscosity within Hooke's regime suggesting that the hydrocarbon chains

act as a buffer for the supplied thermal energy. The bilayer compression is a function of the

initial temperature and the temperature amplitude, but is independent of the chain length.

INTRODUCTION

Fluid  membranes  are  characterized  by  only  two  types  of  possible  elastic  deformations:

stretching and bending, as the shear modulus within a fluid membrane is zero (for review see

Lipowsky,  1995).  Experimental  methods  for  resolving  the  elastic  properties  of  liquid

crystalline  phospholipid  bilayers  include  a  mode  analysis  of  bending  fluctuations,  pipette

aspiration  or  electric  fields  induced  deformations  on  unilamellar  vesicles  (for  reviews  see,

Helfrich,  1995;  Evans,  1995).  For  multilamellar  vesicles  additional  forces  arise  from

interactions  between  opposing  bilayer  surfaces.  In  the  case  of  electrically  neutral

phospholipids the equilibrium structure is determined by attractive van  der Waals forces and

repulsive  hydration  and  steric  forces  (for  review  see  Parsegian  and  Rand,  1995).  The

experimental  techniques  for  exploring  the  interaction  potentials  are  the  surface  force

apparatus,  the  osmotic  stress  method,  atomic  force  microscopy  and  pipette  aspiration

(Parsegian  and  Rand,  1995).  However,  a  unifying  theoretical  description  of  the  liquid

crystalline layered structures is still lacking, and presently membrane biophysics relies on a

rather  empirical  exponential  model-function  of  the  repulsive  forces  (Parsegian and  Rand,

1995).

Since the elastic properties of phospholipid bilayers determine the equilibrium structure, the

bilayer  elasticity  appears  to  be  even  more  important  for  biological  non-equilibrium

"switching"  processes,  such  as  cell  fusion  or  pore  formation:  only  a  conservation  of  the

membrane  structure  will  preserve  the  vital  function  of  the  biological  membrane  in  cell

compartimentation  and  communication.  Rapid  pressure  and  temperature  jump  experiments

on phospholipid phase transitions (Pressl et al. 1997; Rapp and Goody, 1991) in combination

with time resolved x-ray diffraction (Gruner, 1987; Caffrey, 1989; Rapp, 1992; Cunningham

4

et  al.  1994)  have  revealed  that  the  fast  phase  transitions  proceed  without  any  detectable

disruption  of  the  multilamellar  stack  order  (Laggner  and  Kriechbaum  1991;  Rapp  et  al.,

1993;  Laggner  et  al.,  1999).  The  most  intriguing  observation  with  such  experiments  is  an

anomalous,  thin  lamellar  intermediate  structure,  induced  by  a  T-jump  through  the

pretransition  of  dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine  (Rappolt  M.,  G.  Pabst,  G.  Rapp,  M.

Kriechbaum, H. Amenitsch, C. Krenn, S. Bernstorff, and P. Laggner. New evidence for gel-

liquid  crystalline  phase  co-existence  in  the  ripple  phase  of  phosphatidylcholines.  Eur.

Biophys. J.  ,  submitted).  T-jumps  in  the  La -phase  region  have  revealed  a  similar,  non-

equilibrium  intermediate  structure  –  designated  as  La *  -  with  a  lifetime  in  the  sub-second

range (Laggner et al., 1999).

In  this  article  we  present  an  explanation  for  the  observed  phenomena  of  the  La -La *-La

transition  based  on  a  structural  calculation  of  the  intermediate  structure  through  a  recently

developed  x-ray  analysis  method  (Pabst,  G.,  M.  Rappolt,  H.  Amenitsch,  and  P.  Laggner.

Structural  information  from  multilamellar  liposomes  at  full  hydration:  X-ray  data  analysis

method.  Phys.  Rev.  E,  submitted.).  We  further  present  a  relaxation  model  which  gives

qualitative insight into mechanical membrane properties. The results demonstrate that the T-

jump  technique  provides  a  sensitive  way  to  determine  the  interacting  forces  between

opposing  bilayers  and  within  the  bilayer  itself,  i.e.,  between  the  lipid  molecules.  Thus,  the

method is an additional tool to gain valuable information on the physical interactions of fluid

membrane stacks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

I. Sample preparation

POPC  (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine),  DPPC  (1,2-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-

sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) 

and 

DSPC 

(1,2-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-

phosphocholine) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, > 99% purity) and

used  without  further  purification.  Multilamellar  liposomes  were  prepared  by  dispersing

weighted amounts of lipids (20 - 30% w/w) in pure water (Fluka, Neu Ulm, Germany: double

quartz distilled water, with a specific resistance 18 MW

 cm) and incubating the dispersions for

4  hours  at  least  10°C  above  the  main  transition  temperature  to  guarantee  full  hydration.

During this period the lipid dispersions were vigorously vortexed. To avoid radiation damage

the total exposure-time was kept as low as possible, i.e., each single experiment was carried

out with fresh sample but of the same stock. Random thin layer chromatography tests on silica

gel-plates 60 (Merck,  Darmstadt,  Germany)  resulted  normal.  The  solvent  used  was  chloro-

form/methanol/water (65/25/4).

II. Instrumentation and X-ray Diffraction

Diffraction  patterns  were  recorded  at  the  Austrian  Small  Angle  X-ray  Scattering  (SAXS)

beamline  at  ELETTRA  (Amenitsch  et  al.,  1998;  Bernstorff  et  al.,  1998),  using  a  one-

dimensional  position  sensitive  detector  (Gabriel,  1977)  which  covered  the  q-range  (q  =  4p

sinq /l ) of interest from about 0.03 Å-1 to 0.52 Å-1. The angular calibration of the detector was

determined  by  using  the  SAXS-diffraction  patterns  of  silver-behenate  (CH3(CH2)20COOAg:

d-spacing = 58.38 Å) (Huang et al., 1993). The lipid dispersions were kept in a thin-walled 1

6

mm diameter Mark capillary held in a steel cuvette, which provides good thermal contact to

the Peltier heating unit (Anton  Paar, Graz, Austria). T-jumps were generated by an erbium-

glass IR-laser (Kriechbaum et al., 1990; Rapp and Goody, 1991). The experimental setup is

schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The laser-pulse energy varied from 0.78 to 2.40 J resulting in

an average T-jump amplitude  D T of 5 to 16(cid:176) C (Tab. 1). The variation given for the T-jump

amplitude derives mainly from the difficulty to measure precisely the energy deposited onto

the sample, which depends on the accuracy of measurement of the laser-pulse energy (± 5%),

the estimation of the geometric properties given in the experimental set-up (10% error), and

the estimation of the absorption in the sample (10% error); however, the reproducibility of the

laser-pulse  energy  lies  within  2%.  A  time-resolved  experiment  (one  cycle)  consisted  of  a

series of 256 time-frames of pattern detection, with the laser (pulse-length 2 ms), triggered at

the beginning of the 11th frame. The maximum time resolution of the X-ray experiment, i.e.,

right after the laser shot, was set to 5 ms. The total exposure time of one cycle was 16 s. Each

experiment was repeated 3 times, i.e., every diffraction pattern was averaged over 3 cycles.

The  raw  data  of  the  time-resolved  experiments  were  normalized  for  the  integration  time  of

each time-frame, and the background (capillary with water) was subtracted.

III. Structure Calculations

The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  POPC  have  been  analyzed  in  terms  of  the  MCG  method

(Pabst,  G.,  M.  Rappolt,  H.  Amenitsch,  and  P.  Laggner.  Structural  information  from

multilamellar  liposomes  at  full  hydration:  X-ray  data  analysis  method.  Phys.  Rev.  E,

submitted.).  MCG  is  a  diffraction  model  that  combines  a  modified  Caillé  theory  structure

factor (Caillé, 1967; Zhang et al., 1994) with the form factor of a Gaussian representation of

7

the  electron  density  profile  such  that  it  accounts  for  both,  Bragg  diffraction  and  diffuse

scattering. The method is thus capable of retrieving structural information even if only a few

orders  of  diffraction  are  observed.  The  basic  concepts  of  the  model  are  summarized  as

follows.

fastest relaxation to equilibrium without any oscillation. For details on harmonic oscillators

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

I. Equilibrium Structure

We took static X-ray diffraction patterns of POPC liposomal dispersions in a range of 10°C to

70°C  within  the  La -phase  of  POPC  in  excess  of  water.  The  sample  was  held  at  each

temperature  for  5  minutes  before  the  measurement  was  started,  so  that  the  system  can  be

regarded as being in thermal equilibrium. Fig. 2 shows the changes in the d-spacing, bilayer

thickness,  and  water  layer  thickness,  as  the  temperature  is  increased.  The  lamellar  repeat

decreases as the temperature is raised up to 30°C down to a value of d = 63.6 ± 0.1 Å. Above

30°C, the bilayer-water system swells again and finally exhibits a larger lattice parameter at

10

-
70°C than at 10°C. The decomposition of the d-spacings into bilayer and interbilayer water

thickness  reveals  that  this  is  caused  by  an  uptake  of  water,  as  the  membrane  thickness

continuously decreases with increasing temperature, but the bilayer separates more and more,

such  that  the  sum  of  both  gives  the  observed  re-increase  in  d-spacing.  With  respect  to  the

results  which  will  be  presented  in  subsection  III,  we  draw  the  attention  to  the  membrane

thickness, which first decreases linearly with temperature, but shows an asymptotic behavior

above  50°C.  The  characteristics  of  the  La -phase  are  “molten”  hydrocarbon  chains  due  to  a

transition from a all-trans to a  trans-gauche state. An increase in temperature progressively

induces trans-to-gauche conformation changes – the minimal energy difference between trans

and gauche states is 500 cal mol-1 (Flory, 1969) –, but since the hydrocarbon tails are finite in

length,  only  a  limited  number  of  gauche  isomers  can  be  generated.  This  corresponds  to  a

saturation  effect  in  hydrocarbon  chain  melting  as  has  been  found  before,  e.g.,  for  DPPC

(Seelig and  Seelig,  1974)  that  causes  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  membrane  thickness,

which is also observed for POPC above 50°C (Fig. 2). The reduction of the bilayer thickness

has been first described by Luzzati and co-workers, and explained in terms of a rubber-like

model for the hydrocarbon chain elasticity (Luzzati, 1968). Concomitantly with the decrease

in thickness, the bilayer responds to the temperature increase by a lateral expansion, as each

single phospholipid molecule requires more space due to the increasing degrees of motional

freedom at higher temperatures (for review see  Cevc and Marsh 1987;  Hianik et al., 1998).

The linear thermal expansion coefficient a, defined as

D=

is given as a function of temperature in Fig. 3. The mean value of  a

  =  -2.2·10-3  K-1  below

50°C is close to the linear thermal expansion coefficient of –2.7·10-3 K-1 for K-soaps (Luzzati,

1968)  and  –2.5·10-3  K-1  for  DPPC  (Seelig  and  Seelig,  1974).  The  thermal  expansion

11

D
coefficient decreases linearly from 50°C to70°C to a value of  a = -0.5·10-3  K-1, indicating a

reduced bilayer elasticity. At first sight, this appears to be surprising as one would expect a

more  fluid  bilayer  at  higher  temperatures  with  increased  disorder.  However,  fluid  DPPC

bilayers have been found to have less order, but a ten times larger viscosity than soaps, e.g.,

sodium decanoate-decanol bilayers (Seelig and Seelig, 1974).

II. Intermediate Structure

Fig. 4 shows the kinematographic diffraction patterns of a typical jump/relaxation experiment.

The structure of the La -phase under equilibrium conditions at the given system temperature T0

is  the  starting  point  and  reference  for  the  T-jump  experiment  (Fig.  4).  With  the  laser  flash

(duration:  2  ms)  the  original  structure  converts  quasi  discontinuously,  i.e.,  within  the  time

resolution of the experiment*, into a lamellar phase, whose d-spacing is clearly thinner than

the corresponding lattice parameter under equilibrium conditions at T = T0 +  D T (Laggner et

al., 1999). The excited phase, denoted as La *, relaxes within the time scale of seconds back to

the  equilibrium  d-spacing.  The  FWHM  of  the  La *-phase  is  smaller  than  the  corresponding

values of the original La -phase.

In the following, the intermediate structure is to be compared with the equilibrium structure

obtained in the previous subsection. As a reference we choose the structure of POPC bilayers

at 20°C, with a d-spacing of 63.9 ± 0.1 Å, a bilayer thickness of 46.7 ± 0.3 Å, and a bilayer

                                                
* The diffraction pattern between the well defined La  and La *-phase is recorded during the

heating of the laser pulse. The broad diffuse peak of this pattern is due to the fast changes in

the lattice parameter and not to a less ordered phase.

12

separation of 17.2 ± 0.3 Å (Fig. 2). The laser voltage was set to 600 V, which corresponds to a

temperature jump of 10 ± 2°C (Tab. 1). In this particular experiment, the T-jump/relaxation

cycles  were  repeated  12  times,  and  the  single  diffraction  patterns  were  added  up  to  reduce

statistic  noise.  We  further  summed  up  the  first  four  5  ms-diffraction  patterns  after  the  laser

pulse, during which the d-spacing relaxes by approximately 0.3 Å only, again to improve the

statistics of the La * diffraction pattern. The structural analysis on La * has been performed by

applying the MCG model (Pabst, G., M. Rappolt, H. Amenitsch, and P. Laggner. Structural

information from multilamellar liposomes at full hydration: X-ray data analysis method. Phys.

Rev.  E,  submitted.),  yielding  62.1  ±  0.5  Å  for  the  lamellar  repeat  distance,  i.e.,  by  1.5  Å

thinner than the minimum repeat distance found under equilibrium conditions (Fig. 2), 45 ±

1.7  Å  for  the  bilayer  thickness,  and  a  water  layer  of  17.1  ±  1.7  Å  thickness.  The

corresponding bilayer thickness at 30°C under equilibrium conditions is 45.6 ± 0.3 Å, and the

value of dw is  18 ± 0.5 Å (Fig. 2). Within the limits of measurement error it can be assumed

that the bilayer shrinks proportionally to the heat deposited, according to

wherein  dB*  denotes  the  bilayer  thickness  of  La *.  We  can  further  calculate  the  change  in

(15)

where A and  A* are the respective areas per phospholipid molecule, which can be estimated

according  to  the  formalism  of  Nagle  and  co-workers  (Nagle  et  al.,  1996).  For  the  given

temperature of T0 = 20°C, we calculate a volume change of  DVW = -17 Å3. For comparison:

the volume of one water molecule is approx. 30 Å3.  Thus,  the  change  in  interbilayer  water

volume can be regarded as zero. However, we estimate the error to be larger than 50 Å3, since

the  employed  estimates  of  the  T-jump  amplitude  and  of  the  area  per  lipid  include

uncertainties, which strongly influence the result.

The  result  predicts  a  anomalous  thin  water  layer  of  the  intermediate  structure:  the

temperature-induced decrease in membrane thickness is accompanied by a lateral expansion

of the bilayer (Cevc and Marsh, 1987). As there is no water exchange with the excess aqueous

phase  directly  after  the  laser  shot  (DVW  =  0),  the  interbilayer  water  will  follow  the  lateral

bilayer  expansion  which  gives  the  observed  thin  layer.  The  transient  water  deficit  can  also

explain  the  observed  sharp  Bragg  peaks  of  the  La *-phase,  as  more  layers  can  contribute

coherently  to  Bragg  diffraction,  similarly  to  phosphatidylethanolamine  multilayers,  which

incorporate less than half the amount of water compared to phosphatidylcholine multilayers,

and which exhibit sharper Bragg peaks than phosphatidylcholines in the La -phase (McIntosh

and Simon, 1986).

III. Relaxation Kinetics

The relaxation kinetics of the IR-laser T-jump induced La -La * transitions have been analyzed

in terms of the relaxation model presented in the theory section (Eqs. 4, 9-12). Fig. 5a shows

the changes in the lattice parameter as a function of time for a 16°C T-jump from T0 = 20°C.

Time  equals  zero  at  the  first  frame  after  the  laser  shot.  The  individual  data  points  were

obtained by fitting the first order Bragg peak of each single diffraction pattern by a Lorentzian

function. The solid line in Fig. 5a gives the best fit of the d-spacing relaxation to the double

exponential decay model (Eq. 6) yielding a fast time of constant 0.45 ± 0.02 s and a slower

component of t = 3.0 ± 0.1 s. The lower part of Fig. 5a further illustrates the time course of

the maximum intensity and FWHM of the first order Bragg peak. The intermediate phase, at t

=  0,  has  a  thinner  FWHM  and  an  increased  peak  intensity  as  compared  to  the  original  La -

phase. Both, maximum intensity and FWHM, decay rapidly to values below the equilibrium

14

La   reference  values  and  start  to  recover  after  2  s.  Even  after  16  s,  when  the  d-spacing  has

retained  its  equilibrium  value,  the  peak  intensity  and  FWHM  indicate  that  the  relaxation

process is still going on. The total relaxation time is about 30 to 40 s. Fig. 5b depicts the first

and  the  second  derivative  of  the  d-spacing  relaxation,  i.e.,  the  relaxation  velocity  and  the

relaxation  acceleration,  for  the  first  5  seconds  of  the  relaxation  process.  The  relaxation  is

initially driven by a strong acceleration which diminishes after 2-3 seconds, whereupon the

relaxation proceeds with constant velocity.

We  shall  try  to  obtain  further  insight  from  energetic  aspects.  Fig.  6  depicts  the  interaction

potential  between  two  bilayer  surfaces.  For  neutral  phospholipids  the  interacting  forces  are

attractive van der Waals, repulsive hydration, and steric forces (Marra and Isrealachvili, 1985;

Lipowsky, 1995; Parsegian and Rand, 1995). The bilayer separation is given by the minimum

of  the  potential  curve.  At  higher  temperatures,  the  potential  well  is  shallower,  and  the

minimum moves to larger bilayer separations. Through the T-jump, the bilayer/water system

is  quasi  discontinuously  forced  into  the  intermediate  state  (Fig.  6  ˜),  sensing  the  strong

repulsive  part  of  the  interaction  potential  that  drives  the  water  layer  thickness  towards  the

equilibrium separation (Fig. 6 ¯). As the temperature of the systems does not remain at T0  +

D T,  but  slowly  decreases  to  T0,  the  interaction  potential  changes  continuously,  and  the

equilibrium separation moves again to smaller values. The bilayer separation has to follow the

changes via a series of potential wells.

So far, we have considered the bilayer/water system as a closed system that does not interact

with the excess water phase. In reality, also diffusion of bulk water through the phospholipid

bilayers  will  have  an  impact  on  the  relaxation  process.  Diffusion  proceeds  either  directly

through  the  membrane  or  through  local  membrane  defects,  i.e.,  several  times  faster,  and  is

15

driven by the hydration forces due to the water deficit. Thus, the rate of water transport into

the interbilayer space will affect the relaxation velocity by retarding (damping) the relaxation

process.

Since  the  temperature  of  the  heated  sample  volume  decreases  in  the  later  stages  of  the

experiment  by  heat  diffusion  into  the  unheated  sample  regions,  we  have  to  consider  two

processes, at the same time: a relaxation – due to the  anomalously  thin  water  layer  –  and  a

bilayer  swelling  –  due  to  the  decrease  in  temperature.  Both  processes  are  governed  by  the

elastic properties of the bilayer/water system. However, we expect the first process, i.e., the

structural relaxation, to be initially dominant over the temperature dependent bilayer swelling.

The rapid drop in intensity (Fig. 5a) and the relaxation acceleration (Fig. 5b) within the first

2-3  seconds  after  the  laser  pulse  can  be  therefore  interpreted  as  the  fingerprint  of  this

relaxation process. The constant relaxation velocity (Fig. 5b) is then attributed to the second –

swelling  –  process.  The  swelling  velocity  is  governed  by  the  interplay  of  temperature

dependent  molecular  rearrangements  within  the  phospholipid  bilayer  and  water  diffusion  in

and out of the water layers, as the system will generally face both non-equilibrium positions

on  the  interaction  potential  well  (Fig.  6),  attracting  and  repelling.  A  possible  relaxation

pathway of the bilayer separation is sketched in Fig. 6.

A further interesting aspect of T-jump experiments in the La -phase is the relaxation behavior

of  the  lattice  parameter  as  a  function  of  starting  temperature  (T0),  and  temperature  jump

amplitude  (D T),  respectively.  We  first  present  the  results  upon  varying  the  starting

temperature. The liposomal dispersion of POPC was equilibrated at temperatures between 10

and 70°C. At each temperature we performed a T-jump experiment with a jump amplitude of

D T = 10 ± 2°C. The relaxation kinetics of the d-spacings were analyzed in terms of the double

16

exponential  decay  model  (Eqs.  4,  9  –  12).  Fig.  7  shows  the  results  for  the  most  important

parameters, i.e., the change in repeat distance Dd, the square of oscillation frequency  w0

2 , the

damping factor  d, the zero velocity  v0 and the zero acceleration  a0.  As  T0  is  increased,  the

absolute value of Dd decreases linear up to a temperature of 50°C. This agrees well with the

findings under equilibrium conditions, where the membrane thickness also exhibited a linear

decrease  in  the  range  of  10°C  to  50°C  (Fig.  2).  For  the  present  purposes,  water  can  be

regarded  as  an  incompressible  medium,  and  therefore,  Dd  is  directly  related  to  the

compressibility of the phospholipid membrane stacks.

The  results  therefore  demonstrate  that  below  50°C,  the  transmitted  thermal  energy  can  be

directed  into  a  membrane  thinning.  Mechanically,  this  regime  corresponds  to  a  linear

relationship  between  applied  tension  and  deformation,  i.e.,  Hooke’s  law.  This  is  also

expressed  in  the  constancy  of  the  other  parameters  w0

2

  ,  d ,  v0  and  a0.  However,  these

parameters cannot be attributed to membrane properties only. Here, the bilayer/water system

has to be considered as an entity, since it is the interplay of repulsive and attractive forces of

bilayer/water  interactions  which  governs  the  relaxation  process  and  thus  influences  these

parameters. As described in the theory section, the square of the oscillation frequency  w0

2 is

directly related to the proportionality constant of the repelling forces, which are dominated by

hydration potentials (Fig. 6). The results depicted in Fig. 8 clearly show that, as long as the

linearity of  Hooke’s  law  is  given,  the  relaxation  proceeds  with  the  same  "spring  constant".

This  further  emphasizes  that  the  transmitted  energy  can  be  transformed  into  hydrocarbon

trans-gauche transitions within the regime of  Hooke’s law, so that the bilayer separation and

hence also the bilayer repulsion after the laser pulse is practically the same. In this sense, the

hydrocarbon chains act as a buffer for the thermal energy.

17

A similar behavior is found for the damping factor, which is related to the system inertia or

viscosity. As the viscosity of water can be neglected, the d parameter is a measure of viscosity

of the phospholipid bilayers. The viscosity also includes the permeability of the membrane for

water, since we concluded before, that water will diffuse from the excess phase into the water

layer of the membrane stacks. Above 50°C, the total change in d-spacing exhibits saturation,

no further compression of the bilayer/water system can be achieved with the supplied laser

energy. As found under equilibrium conditions, the bilayer is less elastic above 50°C due to

the  maximum  number  of  gauche  isomers  reached.  The  transmitted  energy  cannot  be

completely buffered by the bilayer, so that the reaction, i.e., membrane thinning, to the sudden

temperature increase is not strictly linear, resulting in a minimal constant  Dd above 50°C. The

excess of thermal energy results in a stronger repulsion of the membrane surfaces as observed

in the increase of w0

2

 , d , v0 and a0.

Fig. 8, depicts the changes in the relaxation parameters as a function of the temperature jump

amplitude. The sample was equilibrated at 40°C and the laser voltage was varied from 500 to

750 V in steps of 50 V, yielding the different T-jump amplitudes (Tab. 1). With increasing T-

jump  amplitude,  the  absolute  value  of  Dd  increases  linear.  The  square  of  the  oscillation

frequency and the damping factor show a statistic variation, but can be regarded as constant

within in the measurement error. On the other hand, both zero velocity and zero acceleration

show a strong statistic variation, but a tendency to increase with increasing T-jump amplitude.

At 40°C, the system is very close to the end of validity of  Hooke’s  law.  This  proximity  to

non-linearity  may  be  the  reason  for  the  strong  statistic  fluctuations  of  the  relaxation

parameters w0

2

 , d , v0 and a0. Nevertheless, the results clearly state that the discrete jump in

the repeat distance  Dd is a linear function of the transmitted laser energy and that the other

18

relaxation  parameters  are  independent  of  the  T-jump  amplitude,  as  long  as  the  linearity  of

Hooke’s law holds.

If T-jumps are sensible to the hydrocarbon chain elasticity, then one would expect different

results  for  phospholipids  with  different  chain  lengths.  Table  2  shows  the  fitted  relaxation

parameters for fluid DPPC, POPC and DSPC multilayers. The laser energy was adjusted to a

T-jump  amplitude  of  16°C.  The  results  reveal  that  the  discrete  change  in  d-spacing  Dd  is

within the measurement error for all three lipids equal to ~ 2.6 Å. Since this shrinkage can be

attributed to hydrocarbon chain melting, we conclude that an equal amount of energy deposit

causes  an  equal  amount  of  trans-gauche  transformations.  However,  the  other  parameters

exhibit  a  dependence  on  the  lipid  type.  Most  interestingly,  the  square  of  the  oscillation

frequency is highest for POPC, such that the increasing order with respect to  w0

2 is DPPC <

DSPC < POPC. This might be an effect of the unsaturated 18:1c9 chain of POPC, but as w0

2

is  related  to  the  repelling  forces,  the  reason  might  also  be  a  better  packing  of  the

phospholipids at lower temperatures (Tab. 2), because a more compact bilayer will provide a

better  surface  for  the  affecting  repulsive  forces.  Nevertheless,  the  damping  coefficient  d

increases with hydrocarbon chain length, which is reasonable as one would expect a higher

viscosity for thicker membranes. The zero velocity  v0 and zero acceleration  a0, respectively,

exhibit the same dependence on hydrocarbon chain length.

19

CONCLUSION

The reaction of the liquid-crystalline multilayer system to the T-jump proceeds via an excited

state.  This  intermediate  structure  La *  is  characterized  by  a  membrane  thickness  which

compares  to  its  equilibrium  value  at  T0 +  D T and an  anomalously  thin  water  layer,  as  the

result of a lateral expansion of the membrane and the impossibility of a sufficiently fast water

diffusion  from  the  excess  phase  into  the  water  layers  of  the  membrane  stacks.  Strong

repulsive hydration forces then initiate the relaxation process (Fig. 5), where the membrane

viscosity and its permeability for water controls the relaxation velocity. As the heat within the

sample volume dissipates into the surrounding unheated sample, the relaxation proceeds over

a series of potential wells and the finial state is equal to the original La -phase (Fig. 6). Fig. 9

shows a cartoon of the T-jump induced structural transformation; the POPC bilayer has been

generated by a molecular dynamics simulation (Heller et al., 1993). Since the only two types

of elastic deformations for fluid membranes are stretching and bending (Lipowsky, 1995), the

possible forms of the deformed intermediate liposomes are elongated vesicles or liposomes

with a rippled "harmonica-like" topology (left inset of Fig. 9).

In addition to a structural model for the La -La * transition, the T-jump/relaxation experiments

were  found  to  provide  a  qualitative,  fundamental  insight  into  the  elastic  properties  of  the

phospholipid bilayers. The elastic properties of model membranes have been discussed ever

since  Luzzati  and  co-workers  described  the  hydrocarbon  chain  properties  as  rubber-like

(Luzzati,  1968),  where  the  impact  of  the  elasto-mechanic  membrane  features  is  of  high

interest for membrane protein interactions (e.g.  Mouritsen  and  Bloom,  1984;  Nielsen  et  al.,

1998, Lundbæk and Andersen, 1999). The standard measurement techniques for mechanical

bilayer properties are pipette aspiration, the surface force apparatus, the osmotic stress method

20

and atomic force microscopy (Evans, 1995, Parsegian and Rand, 1995). However, the generic

interactions  of  stacks  of  fluctuating  membranes  are  still  missing  an  accepted  theoretical

formulation, i.e., the physical basis of the hydration forces is not yet understood. Here T-jump

experiments can give additional information, since they directly probe the membrane stacks

mechanic  characteristics  as  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  present  work  for  three  different

phospholipids  (Tab.  2).  So  far  the  concept  relies  on  a  qualitative  analysis  given  by  the

relaxation parameters  Dd,  w0 and  d.  Future  research  will  be  directed  towards  a  relaxation

theory  that  allows  for  a  quantitative  evaluation  of  membrane  properties.  As  physical

interaction prediction is of prime importance also for liposomal based rational drug design or

nano-materials,  the  T-jump/relaxation  method  shall  open  the  door  to  a  wider  field  of

applications.

FIGURE 1 Experimental set-up of a T-jump experiment at the SAXS-beamline (Elettra). The

IR-beam  of  a  Erbium  glass  laser  is  directed  via  a  prism  onto  the  sample  capillary  which  is

thermostated  by  a  Peltier  heating  unit.  The  high  flux  x-ray  beam  transverses  the  sample

normal to the IR-beam. The structural changes are recorded by a position sensitive detector

with a maximum time resolution of 5 ms.

FIGURE  2  The  equilibrium  structure  of  POPC  bilayers  in  the  La -phase  at  different

temperatures. The changes on d-spacing, membrane thickness and interbilayer water thickness

are depicted. The observed re-increase in lamellar repeat distance is due to a uptake of water

which  increases  the  bilayer  separation,  whereas  the  membrane  itself  gets  thinner  with

temperature and exhibits an asymptotic behavior above 50°C.

FIGURE  3  The  elastic  properties  of  POPC  bilayers  at  equilibrium.  The  linear  expansion

coefficient a

 exhibits a constant value up to 40°C, and reduces linear as the temperature is

increased further.

FIGURE 4 The La -La *-La  transition in a liposomal dispersion of POPC induced by a 16°C

temperature  jump.  The  series  of  time-sliced  diffraction  shows  the  time  course  of  the  first

order Bragg reflections. The laser is triggered at t = 0.

FIGURE 5 The relaxation kinetics of the La -La *-La  transition. (a) The temporal evolution of

the lamellar repeat distances, obtained by a Lorentzian fit to the first order Bragg peaks. The

straight line gives the best fit of the relaxation model Eq. 4 to the data points. The lower part

depicts  the  changes  in  the  Bragg  peak  intensity  (s)  and  FWHM  (m)  during  a  T-jump

relaxation experiment. (b) The relaxation velocity and the relaxation acceleration during the

first 5 seconds after the laser shot.

FIGURE  6  Illustration  of  the  interaction  potential  as  a  function  of  bilayer  separation  at

different  temperatures.  The  IR-laser  shoots  the  system  into  a  situation  (˜

)  far  away  from

equilibrium,  where  it  faces  the  repulsion  of  hydration  forces.  As  the  temperature  does  not

remain at T0 + D T, but decreases with time to T0 the equilibrium position (¯

) at the reached

temperature will in general not be reached.

FIGURE 7 The relaxation parameters of POPC liposomes as a function of initial temperature

T0. The T-jump amplitude was 16°C at each temperature.

FIGURE  8  The  relaxation  parameters  of  POPC  liposomes  as  a  function  of  the  T-jump

amplitude. The samples were equilibrated at T0 = 40°C before each T-jump experiment.

FIGURE 9 Cartoon of the T-jump induced structural chances on fluid bilayers (using PDB-

files by  Heller et al., 1993). An increase in temperature induces  trans-gauche  transitions  in

the  fatty  acid  tails  and  an  increase  in  lateral  area  per  each  single  phospholipid  molecule

(bottom right insert). This leads in the compound of the membrane to a compression normal

to the bilayer surface and a lateral bilayer expansion. Since water cannot diffuse fast enough

from the excess phase into the interbilayer water region the water layer thickness reduces to

an anomalous thin value. The bottom left insert depicts the possible intermediate forms of the

liposomes.

In the framework of the density functional theory a new electronegativity formulation via the 

Feynman-Kleinert  path  integral  formalism  in  the  markovian  limit  is  proposed.  The 

computation  of  the  electronic  density  follows,  in  terms  of  partition  function,  the  same 

procedure  of 

the  Levy’s  constrained-search  for 

the  wave  function.  The  obtained 

electronegativity scale seems to respect the main criteria largely used for its acceptability. 

Key words: electronegativity, Levy constrained search, Feynman-Kleinert path integral, semi-

classical Wigner expansion, Markovian approximation.

Introduction 

A powerful tool in quantum mechanical and statistical description of  many-body systems is 

given by the path-integral (PI) approach. This method, proposed by Feynman in his seminal 

article [1], provides an alternative formulation of the Schrödinger wave function formalism. 

The  PI  method  is  based  on  the  quantum  principle  of  superposition  that  allows  to  treat  the 

transition amplitude between two states by the sum of amplitudes along all the possible paths 

)(τx

  connecting  them  in  a  given  time 

τ

  [2].  Usually,  the  paths  are  parametrized  by  the  

imaginary time 

βhi

, being  h  the Planck’s constant divided by  2  and 

π

β

  the inverse of the 

thermal  energy.  When  the  closed  paths  are  considered,  i.e. 

)0(x

)βh(x=

,  the  PI  partition 

function  of  the  considered  system  in  its  ground  state  can  be  extracted  [3].  These  are  the 

general  features  that  make  the  PI  approach  a  complete  quantum  mechanical  scheme  able  to 

treat both time-dependent and equilibrium properties of a given system in the framework of 

the so-called Feynman-Kleinert formalism [4-8]. 

In  the  last  decade  the  PI  methods  have  been  the  subject  of  a  great  interest  due  to  their 

reliability in treating atoms [9], membranes [10], stochastic [11] and relativistic systems [12], 

electron-solvent  interaction  [13-17],  polymers  [8],  electron  transfer  in  transition  metal 

containing systems [18-25] and biological molecules [26-29].    

In  this  work  we  enlarge  the  fields  of  applicability  of  PI  methods  to  the  computation  of 

electronegativity in the framework of the density functional theory (DFT) [30-33]. It is well 

known that this concept is crucial in chemistry and has been rigorously defined by Parr et al. 

in  the  past  [34-38].  The  electronegativity,

χ

,  is  the  primary  information  of  an  electronic 

system  and  is  defined  as  the  ability  of  atoms  to  attract  electrons  to  themselves  in  order  to 

build up molecular systems [39, 40]. In DFT the electronegativity is identified as the negative 

of the chemical potential of a given system [37]. Combining our recently derived analytical 

expression  of  the  electronegativity  [41],  with  the  Feynman-Kleinert  PI  formulation  [5],  an 

 

- 2 - 

electronegativity  scale  for  almost  the  entire  periodic  system  is  here  given.  The  obtained 

results  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  previous  electronegativity  data  [35,  36,  42-45], 

encouraging the future use of the PI analytical techniques in the density functional context.

being E and N the total energy and number of electrons at constant external potential V. The 

above  so  called  absolute  electronegativity  recovers  the  chemical  Mulliken  electronegativity, 

Mχ

 [40], through out the identity [46]:

Nevertheless from equations 1 and 2 appears that to compute the Mulliken electronegativity 

the  total  energy  expression  is  required.  Within  the  wave-function  approach  of  electronic 

density, since the ground-state energy has to be found, the specific Levy constrained-search 

scheme is applied [47]. This procedure involves the minimization of the trial total energy in 

two  steps:  by  the  first  one  all  the  possible  wave  functions  are  included  into  the  classes  that 

give  the  same  density,  while  the  second  step  consists  in  a  overall  minimization  of  the 

densities. This scheme is of fundamental importance in DFT with the merit to transform the 

(unsolved) V-representability problem into the N-representability one [32]:

Recently,  [41],  employing  the  softness  kernel  version  of  DFT  [48],  it  was  introduced  an 

analytical expression of the Mulliken electronegativity by-passing the total energy expression. 

In atomic units it looks like (see Appendix):

The  first  two  quantities  depend  on  the  density  gradient  and  can  be  termed  as  chemical 

response indices, whereas CA , which is the simple convolution between the density and the 

external potential represents the chemical action index [41].   Moreover, the electronic density 

in equation 4 has to fit with the Levy’s algorithm, i.e. to be N-representable.          

The  electronegativity  expression  given  in  the  equation  4  represents  our  proposed  DFT 

electronegativity working formula.  

 

Path Integral Constrained-Search Algorithm  

The Mulliken electronegativity requires the knowledge of the electronic density under the 

external  potential  influence.  The  computation  of  the  electronic  density  can  be  carried  out 

using the following expressions:

Since  the  Feynman-Kleinert  PI  approach  is  based  on  the  optimization  of  the  variational 

condition [5]: 

                                                                   Z

the  partition  function  Z1,  related  to  the  approximate  potential  W1(x0),  has  to  be  as  close  as 

possible  to  the  effective  partition  function  Z  of  the  applied  external  potential  V(x0).  The 

condition  8  can  be  seen  as  the  counterpart  of  the  first  step  in  Levy’s  algorithm  in  terms  of 

partition  function:  among  the  possible  effective  partition  functions  is  chosen  that  one  that 

closely  approximates  the  potential W1(x0)  to  the  real  Hamiltonian  in  equation  7.    Following 

this variational procedure an optimal form is found for the potential W

the  Feynman-Kleinert  PI  method  provides  a  suitable  analytical  counterpart,  in  terms  of 

partition function, to the Levy’s formalism in terms of wave function.     

The  PI  procedure  will  be  applied  in  the  framework  of  the  so-called  Markovian 

approximation  [50]  (

0→β

)  which  will  cancels  the  low  temperature  quantum  fluctuations. 

This  limit  corresponds  also    to  the  ultra-short  correlation  of  the  involved  electrons  with  the 

applied  external  potential  due  to  the  time  dependence  of  the  quantum  statistical  quantity 

t∆∝βh

. This means that assuming the free motion of the electrons in absence of an external 

potential  (

0 ⇔=∆t

0=β

),  as  the  external  potential  is  applied  an  immediate  orbit 

t
stabilization  of  the  electronic  system  is  reached  ( ∆

→⇔→

β

0

).  In  other  words,  the 

escape (unstable) paths are precluded [52, 53]. Finally, this limit introduces also correlation 

effects  with 

the  medium.  Changing

From equations 6, 7, 9 and 13-15 appears that the Feynman-Kleinert PI constrained-search 

algorithm  in  the  markovian  limit  provides  an  efficient  recipe  to  compute  the  electronic 

densities using only the external potential dependence. 

Parr  and  Yang  have  shown  [32]  that  the  integral  formulation  of  the  Kohn-Sham  DFT  

arrives  to  the  electronic  density  expression  performing  Wigner  semi-classical  expansion 

combined with the short time approximation (in  parameter).  A similar relation arises from 

β

our  approach  in  which  effective  potential  is  approximated  through  the  equation  9.  All  the 

components around V(x) can be formally interpreted as the exchange-correlation PI  potential 

V PI

  with  the  medium.  Even  if  this  potential  can  be  expanded  in  higher  orders,  the 

truncation of the expansion to the second order [38] gives:

Computational Details 

In order to apply the proposed Mulliken electronegativity formula (see equation 4), the core 

potential, in which the valence electrons are moving should be known. This information can 

be obtained from the pseudopotential approach. In particular, in our work,  the Stuttgart/Bonn 

pseudo-potentials have been employed [55]. 

Since  the  electronic  density  depends  on  the 

β

  parameter,  in  the  PI  calculations  it  can  be 

fixed in such a manner that the electronic density fulfills the normalization condition 18. The 

computations  have  been  performed  in  the  markovian  limit, 

0→β

,  and  a  scale  factor  has 

been  introduced  for  the  electronegativity  and  the  chemical  action  in  order  to  have  similar 

results  (in  absolute  values).  In  this  way  the  relationship  between  the  chemical  action  and 

electronegativity recovers the previous one [56, 57]:

Results and Discussion 

Our results are reported in Table 1 for chemical action and in Table 2 for electronegativity 

together  with  some  previous  electronegativity  scales  obtained  theoretically  [35,  42,  43]  or 

from experimental ionisation potentials and electron affinities [36, 44].  

The proposed electronegativity scale follows the general rules for its acceptability [58]. The 

decreasing of 

χ

 along the group is respected (see, for instance, Ga<Al and Ge<Si) as well as 

its difference in going from light to heavy atoms of the same group. 

χ

 increases left to right 

across  rows  taking  into  account  that  for  some  heavy  elements  the  relativistic  effects,  which 

are  not  considered  in  the  computations,  can  affect  this  trend.  Correctly,  the  halogen  atoms 

have  the  highest  electronegativity  with  respect  to  their  left  row  neighbours.  Looking  to  the 

 

- 8 - 

transition  metal  atoms,  we  underline  that  the  obtained  electronegativities  fall  in  a  narrow 

range of values compared with those of the main group atoms.

The six considered metalloid elements (B, Si, Ge, As, Sb, Te), that separate the metals from 

the  non-metals,  have  electronegativity  values,  which  do  not  allow  overlaps  between  metals 

and non-metals. Furthermore, looking at the 

 metal values the requirement that they must 

χ

have electronegativities lower than silicon is satisfied (see for example Ga<Si, Al<Si, Ge<Si) 

following the so-called silicon rule [58]. Finally, we briefly discuss the values obtained for the 

N, O, F, Ne, Cl, Ar, Br, and Kr elements that present oxidation states lower than their valence 

electrons. The rule in this case states that χ  parallels the decreasing in valence electrons. The 

results follow this rule with the exception of the chlorine atom that has a 

χ

 value higher than 

the nearest noble gas atom Ar.  The electronegativity trend for these atoms results in the order 

Ne>F>O>Cl>N>Ar>Kr>Br.

It is worth to note that the PI treatment does not need the orbital type function but only the 

pseudo-potential  representing  the  field  in  which  the  electrons  move.  In  order  to  verify  the 

influence of the different orbital type we have redone the electronegativity computation for C, 

O and N atoms by using p-type orbitals and the sp, sp2 and sp3 hybridisation states. Results, 

reported in Table 3 and Figure 1, show how the actual electronegativity formulation preserves 

also  the  orbital  hierarchy  and  is  sensitive  to  the  hybrid  orbitals  as  well.  Finally,  analysing 

Table 3 and Fig.1 we underline that the electronegativity trend from a type of hybridisation to 

another is similar.

The  adopted  PI  procedure  supports  different  model  potentials.  With  the  aim  to  test  the 

reliability of the present algorithm for the Coulomb potentials the Bachelet-Hamann-Schülter 

pseudopotentials [59] for C, N and O atoms were adopted and their electronegativity values 

recalculated. The results, both for electronegativity and chemical action, are reported in Table 

4.

Conclusions 

In the framework of density functional theory, we propose the use of the Feynman-Kleinert 

path integral formalism in the markovian approximation to obtain an electronegativity scale. 

It  was  evidenced  how  this  method  corresponds  in  terms  of  partition  function  to  the  Levy’s 

 

- 13 - 

constrained-search  formalism  for  the  wave  function.  The  obtained  electronegativity  scale 

follows almost all the general criteria for its acceptability.

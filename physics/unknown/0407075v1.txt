Abstract 

Observations suggest that the earth’s surface has been warming relative to the 

troposphere for the last 25 years; this is not only difficult to explain but also contrary to 

the results of climate models. We provide new evidence that the disparity is real. 

Introducing an additional data set, R2 2-meter temperatures, a diagnostic variable related 

to tropospheric temperature profiles, we find trends derived from it to be in close 

agreement with satellite measurements of tropospheric temperature. This suggests that 

the disparity likely is a result of near-surface processes. We find that the disparity does 

not occur uniformly across the globe, but is primarily confined to tropical regions which 

are primarily oceanic. Since the ocean measurements are sea surface temperatures, we 

suggest that the disparity is probably associated with processes at the ocean-atmosphere 

interface.  Our study thus makes unlikely some of the explanations advanced to account 

for the disparity; it also demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between land, sea 

and air measurements. 

   

1. Introduction 

 

The question of the degree to which Earth’s surface temperature is increasing is a 

climate problem of great interest. The pattern and magnitude of current and /or future 

warming has both ecological and economic implications. However, the science is not 

settled on these issues, as many outstanding questions remain. For example, General 

Circulation Models (GCMs) predict that as a result of enhanced greenhouse gases and 

atmospheric aerosols, there should be a warming trend that is greater in the low-to-middle 

troposphere than over the earth’s surface [Chase et al., 2004].  However, temperature 

observations taken during the past 25 years do not verify this GCM result [Douglass et al.  

2004].. 

 

2

The globally averaged surface temperature (ST) trend over the last 25 years is 

0.171 K/decade [Jones et al., 2001], while the trend in the lower troposphere from 

observations made by satellites and radiosondes is significantly less, with exact values 

depending on both the choice of dataset and analysis methodology [e.g., Christy et al., 

2003, Lanzante et al., 2003]. This disparity was of sufficient concern for the National 

Research Council (NRC) to convene a panel of experts that studied the “[a]pparently 

conflicting surface and upper air temperature trends” and concluded, after considering 

various possible systematic errors, that “[a] substantial disparity remains”[National 

Research Council, 2000].  The implication of this conclusion is that the temperature of 

the surface and the temperature of the air above the surface are changing at different rates 

due to some unknown mechanism. 

 

A number of studies have suggested explanations for the disparity. Lindzen and 

Giannitsis [2002] have ascribed the disparity to a time delay in the warming of the oceans 

following the rapid temperature increase in the late 1970s.  Hegerl and Wallace [2002] 

have concluded that the disparity is not due to El Nino or cold-ocean-warm-land effects.  

Other authors [Santer et al., 2000] have suggested that the disparity is not real but due to 

the disturbing effects of El Niño and volcanic eruptions, a conclusion that has been 

critiqued by Michaels and Knappenberger [2000]. Still others argue that the disparity 

results from the methodology used to prepare the satellite data [Fu et al., 2004, Vinnikov 

and Grody, 2003]; however, only the results from Christy et al. [2000] have been 

independently confirmed by weather-balloon data [Christy et al., 2000, Christy et al., 

2003, Lanzante et al., 2003, Christy and Norris, 2004].

In this paper, we explore the geographic patterns of the difference between the 

trends in surface and lower-tropospheric temperatures. We rely not only on surface and 

satellite temperature measurements for this comparison, but additionally, we employ a set 

of data, not previously considered, which represents an attempt to reduce tropospheric 

observations to surface temperature values. Through this methodology, we hope to shed 

more light on the nature of this disparity.  

2. Data  

 

We incorporate three temperature datasets into this analysis: observations taken at 

the earth’s surface [Jones et al., 2001], observations of the lower atmosphere made from 

satellites [Christy et al., 2000], and calculated near-surface temperatures (R2-2m), a 

diagnostic variable derived from atmospheric temperature observations tied to 

weather balloons [Kanamitsu et al., 2002]. Each of these datasets contributes unique 

information to the understanding of the evolution of patterns of temperature at and near 

the earth’s surface. 

 

The "surface" temperature (ST) observations commonly utilized in research and 

the media are a combination of near-surface air temperatures for land coordinates and 

below-surface water temperatures for ocean coordinates. The data are monthly anomalies 

from the 1961-1990 mean temperature within 5º by 5º grid cells.The amount of available 

data varies with time and grid cell such that some locations have either no data, or spotty 

data coverage resulting in a total coverage, that is less than global in extent. 

4

The satellite data are observations taken by the microwave sounder units (MSU)  

[Christy et al., 2000]. In this study, we use the MSU data that is best representative of the 

lower troposphere. These data are monthly anomalies from the 1979-1998 mean values 

for 2.5º by 2.5º  grid cells with complete global data coverage.  

Our third dataset is the “2-meter” temperature product (R2-2m) from an update of 

the original National Centers for Environmental Prediction—National Center for 

Atmospheric Research (NCAR)  reanalysis [Kanamitsu et al., 2002; Kalnay et al., 1996]. 

The R2-2m temperature data are modelled primarily from a collection of atmospheric 

measurements from weather balloons and satellites  There is little influence from surface 

thermometers [Kistler et al., 2001; Kalnay et al., 2003], although other surface processes, 

such as snow cover, can contribute. The time-evolution of the R2-2m temperature 

variable is independent of the MSU-derived lower tropospheric temperatures. The 

globally complete R2 data begins in 1979 and continues through the near present. 

However, a change in the snow cover measuring system in late 1998 has resulted in break 

points in the 2-m temperature series in grid cells with seasonal snow cover (W. 

Ebisuzaki, personal communication, 2004).  

3. Methods 

Since we wish to examine the disparity in the temperature trends among these 

three datasets, we limit our analysis to a common observational time series. The starting 

point in our analysis will be 1979, which is the beginning year in both the R2-2m and 

MSU data. We truncate the analysis at December 1996 which avoids the snow cover 

issue in R2-2m. This also avoids the anomalously large 1997 El Nino event in the tropical 

 

 

 

5

Pacific which  Douglass and Clader [2002] showed can severely affect the trend-line.  

We will show later in this paper that it is likely that our conclusions would change little 

had we been able to use data though 2003. 

 

For the period 1979 through 1996, we perform a simple least-squares regression 

analysis through the monthly temperature anomalies for each grid cell in the R2-2m and 

MSU datasets (which contain no missing data). For the ST data, however, we must be 

concerned with missing data. We therefore first aggregate the monthly data into annual 

temperature anomalies requiring at least 9 months of valid data to produce a valid year, 

and then perform our trend analysis on those grid cells with at least 16 (out of 18) valid 

years. We then compare the trends across the three datasets grid cell by grid cell, in 

latitudinally averaged bands, and in global aggregate.  In our comparisons involving 

aggregated grid cells, we first mask out the trends in the gridcells of the globally 

complete R2 and MSU data in which there is not valid ST data so that all our 

comparisons are made to a common geographical area. 

4. Results  

4a. Maps of trend-lines for MSU, ST, and R2-2m.  

For each cell on the surface of the Earth we show the trend-line for the period 

1979-1996 for the MSU, ST, and R2-2m data (See Figures 1A, 1B, and 1C.). One of the 

most striking observations is that the values are geographically highly non-uniform due in 

part to the relatively short period examined and the magnitude of natural variations 

therein.. The greatest positive trends in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) reach values 

 

 

 

6

higher than the greatest positive trends in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), and the greatest 

positive trends are in the mid-latitudes bands. In the NH the highest trend-line values are 

localized in three areas: Region 1. Netherlands/Germany; Region 2. Manchuria/western 

Pacific and Region 3. Pacific ocean/western Alaska.  

There are no regions of large positive trends in the equatorial band, (nor at the 

poles for the MSU data) The polar views dramatically show symmetry about the poles. 

The MSU plots show an unmistakable 3-fold symmetry in the north-polar view and a 4-

fold symmetry in south-polar view.  While less clear, the same symmetry exists also in 

the R2-2m and in the ST maps.   

Averages computed from these plots are listed in Table 1.    

 

4b. Latitude dependence of the zonal average  

We compute the zonal averages of the MSU, ST and R2-2m trends for each 5º 

latitude band and present our results in Figure 2.  They all have maximum values close to 

each other in the band from 40°N to 50°N.  However, in the tropics, the MSU and R2-2m 

trends agree and are both negative, whereas the ST trend values are positive. This 

difference of ~ 0.2 K/decade at tropical latitudes has been noted before [e.g.  Gaffen et 

al., 2000; Singer (2001); Christy et al., 2001]. It is clear from this graph and the maps 

that the maximum near 45°N is real and that values are decreasing as one goes towards 

the pole—in contrast to what some climate models predict. There is also a relative 

maximum in the SH located at approximately 25°S to 30S°. In addition, we made similar 

plots of the data with either the land or the oceans masked out. We found that the 

 

 

 

 

7

maximum at about 45N was 50% higher for the ocean only data. This is consistent with 

the map showing  high positive trends over the Pacific extending from Region 2 to 

Region 3. 

 

 

4c. Northern mid-latitudes (35N to 60N) 
 

Fig. 3A shows latitude band averages (from 35°N to 60N) of the trend values vs. 

longitude. One sees that the variations in amplitude of all three data sets are of about the 

same magnitude and phase.  We note that the three ‘warming’ regions defined in Section 

4a are readily apparent and that Regions 2 and 3 are connected across the Pacific ocean. 

From the general agreement in amplitude and phase of these three data sets we infer that 

the methodologies of all are essentially correct and free from harmful errors.  

4d. Tropics (20S to 20N)  

Fig 3B shows a plot of trend lines vs. longitude, centered at the equator.  It is 

noted that MSU and R2-2m have nearly the same negative means (-0.06 K/decade) while 

ST is positive (0.09 K/decade) (see Table 1).  The difference in mean between ST and 

MSU/R2-2m is 0.15 and is the disparity noted by the NRC [National Research Council, 

2000] and others. 

4e.  Southern mid-latitude band (40S to 20S)  

The plots of the three data sets for the SH mid-latitude band are shown in figure 

3C. Here the 4-fold symmetry in all three data sets is very noticeable. The averages are: 

ST: 0.04 K/decade; MSU: 0.02 K/decade; R2-2m: -0.12 K/decade (see Table 1). These 

 

 

 

 

8

differences are smaller than the amplitudes of the 4-fold oscillation so statements about 

the differences are difficult.   

5.  Results and Discussion 

We have studied the temperature trend-lines given by the MSU, R2-2m and ST 

data for the period 1979 to 1996.  There is general agreement among the three (mostly) 

independent data sets for northern mid-latitudes. It also indicates that the differences we 

observe in the tropics are real—thus also validating and extending previous results for the 

tropics that the magnitude of the trend over the oceans is lower than the ST trend [Gaffen 

et al., 2000; Christy et al., 2001].  

 

To assess sensitivity to the length of record, we repeated our analysis of the 

latitude band average for regions only over the open oceans (regions free of seasonal 

snow cover issues) for 1979-2002. We found some small changes in the absolute trend 

values, but the pattern of relative trend differences remained similar thus supporting the 

robustness of our findings and indicates that our results are not adversely affected by  

truncating the datasets at 1996. 

 

Our results point to near-surface processes in the tropical regions as a leading 

cause in the observed disparity between surface and lower tropospheric temperature 

trends.  As most of the tropical region is dominated by ocean areas, it is possible that 

ocean/atmosphere interactions are a primary driver of the observed trend differences and 

that sea surface temperatures are not reliable indicators of the overlying near surface air 

temperatures.

It is interesting to note that the agreement  among the three datasets is greatest over the more 

industrialized northern extratropics,  indicating that local processes such as urbanization [Kalnay and Cai, 

2004] and industrialization [de Latt and Maurellis, 2004; Michaels et al., 2004] play only a relatively minor 

role in causing differential vertical temperature trends. This result does not suggest that these processes do 

not contribute to the observed warming trend, just that they do not contribute greatly to the temperature 

trend disparity.

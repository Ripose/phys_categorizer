Abstract

In  view  of  a  possible  evolution  of 

the  CERN
accelerator  complex  towards  higher  proton  intensities,  a
2.2  GeV  H-  linac  with  4  MW  beam  power  has  been
designed, for use in connection with an accumulator and
compressor  ring  as  proton  driver  of  a  muon-based
Neutrino Factory. The high-energy part of this linac can
use most of the RF equipment (superconducting  cavities
and  klystrons) 
its
decommissioning  at  the  end  of  2000.  Recent  results
concerning 
superconducting  cavities  are
presented, and the main characteristics of the linac design
are  described.  The  complete  linac-based  proton  driver
facility is outlined, and the impact on the linac design of
the  requirements  specific  to  a  Neutrino  Factory  is
underlined.

1. THE LEP-2 RF SYSTEM

The decommissioning of the CERN LEP e+ e– collider
at the end of 2000 will pave the way to the construction
of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but will also present
the  unprecedented  challenge  of  the  removal,  storage  or
disposal,  and  possible  recycling  of  the  huge  amount  of
valuable LEP equipment.

A  particularly  valuable 

the  352.2 MHz
superconducting RF system built for the Phase 2 of LEP,
consisting of 288 four-cell cavities (Figure 1) operating at
4.5 °K  and  powered  by  36  1.3 MW  CW  klystrons.  It
delivers a total accelerating voltage of about 3 GV to the
electron  beam.  Eight  more  klystrons  are  used  to  power
the  normal-conducting  RF  system  of  LEP,  for  a  total  of
44  klystrons  installed  in  the  machine.  Most  of  the
superconducting  cavities  (272)  were  produced  using  the
technique developed at CERN of sputtering a thin film of
niobium  onto  copper  [1].  The  cavities  were  initially
designed for a gradient of 6 MV/m, and during the 1999
run they achieved an average gradient of 7.5 MV/m, with
up  to  9 MV/m  in  some  cavities  [2].  In  the  basic  LEP
configuration, each klystron feeds 8 cavities via an array
of magic tees, equipped with circulators and loads. Four
cavities  are  grouped  in  a  cryostat.  The  cavities  and  the
cryostats  are  fully  equipped  with  slow  and  fast  tuners,
power  couplers  matched  for  a  beam  current  of  10  mA,
high-order-mode couplers, superinsulation and insulation
vacuum tanks.

2. A LINAC BASED ON LEP CAVITIES
Some  proposals  for  re-using  this  expensive  hardware
have been made, such as for a Free Electron Laser [3] or
to  build  the  ELFE  machine  on  the  CERN  site,  a
recirculating electron linac for nuclear physics [4].

An  early  proposal  already  opened  the  perspective  of
in  a  high  beam  power

using 
superconducting linac driving a hybrid reactor [5-7].

the  LEP  cavities 

The  main  limitation  for  using  these  cavities  in  proton
linacs comes from the fact that they are designed for b =1,
their transit time factor drastically decreasing for a proton
beam  at  low  beta.  Figure  2  shows  a  calculation  of  the
effective cavity gradient as function of energy that can be
reached by LEP cavities operating at a nominal gradient
of  7.5  MV/m.  While  in  principle  they  can  be  used  for
proton  acceleration  from  about  500  MeV,  they  become
efficient  and  economically  justified  only  from  about
1 GeV,  i.e.  in  an  energy  range  beyond  the  usual
requirements of high-power linacs for spallation sources,
transmutation or hybrid reactors.

The  present  plans  foresee  to  store  most  of  the  RF
material for possible future use. The cryogenic system of
LEP will be used for the LHC magnets.

Secondly,  strong  interest  has  been  recently  shown  by
the physics community for the high-intensity high-quality
neutrino  beams  that  can  be  provided  by  a  Neutrino
Factory based on a muon decay ring. CERN has recently
started a study on the technological challenges of such a
Neutrino  Factory,    that  resulted  in  the  CERN  Reference
Scenario of Figure 3 [10].

As will be seen in the following, applications of linacs
for  physics  research  at  energy  > 1  GeV  exist,  but  they
require  beam  powers  of  only  a  few  MW  and  a  well-
defined time structure of the beam. This imposes a pulsed
operation  mode  that  has  to  be  optimised  to  achieve  a
reasonable  mains-to-RF  efficiency.  High  duty  cycles  are
preferable  because  they  reduce  the  impact  of  the  static
cryogenic  losses,  and  long  pulses  minimise  the  relative
effect of the RF power lost during the relatively long (1-
2 ms)  pulse  rise  time,  when  all  the  power  is  reflected
from the couplers.

However,  the  LEP  cavities  are  well  suited  for  pulsed
operation  because  of  the  inherent  rigidity  of  the  copper
cavity  structure  and  of  the  relatively  low  gradient  that
make  them  less  sensitive  to  Lorentz  force  detuning  and
vibration  problems.  The  large  (241 mm)  aperture  is
particularly useful for machines sensitive to beam losses.

3  APPLICATIONS OF A 2 GEV LINAC
The first proposal to replace the present 50 MeV linac
and  the  1.4  GeV  Booster  in  the  CERN  proton  injector
chain  with  a  Superconducting  Proton  Linac  (SPL)  dates
from  1996  [8].  In  the  original  scheme  this  machine  was
intended to accelerate mainly protons, and although in the
following  studies  the  advantages  of  a  common  H–
operation for all the users became clear, the title of SPL
has  been  maintained.  A  first  feasibility  study  [9]
considered a 2 GeV H–  SPL equipped with LEP cavities
from  1 GeV  energy,  injecting  at  0.8  Hz  repetition  rate
into the Proton Synchrotron (PS) ring. This new injector
would  have  several  benefits  over  the  present  injection
scheme for the LHC:
- 

a  factor  3  increase  in  the  brightness  of  the  proton
beam  (density  in  transverse  phase  space)  delivered
by  the  PS  injector  complex,  due  to  the  lower  space
charge tune shift at injection, which is an advantage
for LHC;
the potential for improving the peak intensity in the
PS for experiments requiring a high proton flux;
the  reduction  of 
exchange injection and a chopped linac beam;
the  replacement  of  the  PS  injectors  by  modern  and
standard equipment.

However, such a machine would be fully justified only
when pulsed at a higher rate, and  the  original  feasibility
study aimed somehow arbitrarily for 5% duty cycle.

On  the  basis  of  this  preliminary  study,  some  user
communities have shown their interest in a high-intensity
facility  at  CERN.  Firstly  there  is  the  strong  demand  for
second  generation  radioactive  nuclear  beam  facilities  in
Europe.  The  SPL  could  easily  become  the  driver  of  a
facility  based  at  CERN  that  would  profit  from  the
experience gained at ISOLDE. The mean current required
is  about  100 m A,  preferably  distributed  in  many  low
intensity pulses and at a variable energy.

Figure 3: Possible layout of a Neutrino Factory

The  main  challenges  for  this  machine  come  from  the
need  for  high  neutrino  fluxes.  The  interest  for  physics
starts from some 1021 neutrinos/year, that can be obtained
with about 4 MW beam power from a driver accelerator
delivering  protons  on  a  target,  producing  pions  which
decay  into  muons.  After  cooling  and  acceleration,  the
muons are stored in a decay ring where they generate two
intense neutrino beams.

in 

the 

 Simulations  of  particle  production 

target
indicate  that  the  number  of  pions  is  approximately
proportional  to  beam  power  for  energies  ‡
  2  GeV.  This
suggests that a low-energy linac-based driver constitutes a
viable  alternative  to  conventional  high-energy,  fast-
cycling  synchrotrons.  The  HARP  experiment  at  CERN
[11]  is  intended  to  provide  experimental  data  on  pion
production  at  different  energies  and  from  different
targets, for a final confirmation of the low energy choice.
Muon  collection,  cooling  system  and  decay  ring
impose  a  well-defined  time  structure  for  the  beam  on
target.  This  requires  two  rings  after  the  linac,  an
Accumulator to produce a 3.3 m s burst of 140 bunches at
44  MHz  (the  frequency  of  the  muon  phase  rotation
section) and a Compressor to reduce the bunch length to
3  ns  [12].  The  rings  have  been  designed  to  fit  in  the
existing ISR tunnel. Space charge and beam stability are
their major design concerns. To reduce space charge tune
shift  at  injection  into  the  accumulator,  the  linac  bunch
length has to be stretched in the transfer line, from about
30 ps to 0.5 ns, by means of two bunch rotating cavities.

4  THE SPL H– LINAC DESIGN

4.1 Main Parameters

The parameters of this machine (Table 1) had to take
into  account  the  optimum  operating  conditions  of  the
superconducting  cavities  discussed  in  Section  2,  and
are  mainly  determined  by  the  needs  of  the  Neutrino
Factory,  by  far  the  most  demanding  user  in  terms  of
particle flux and time structure of the beam pulses.

The  mean  current  during  the  pulse  of  11  mA  has
been selected as a compromise between the number of
klystrons  needed  in  the  superconducting  section,  the
efficiency  of  the  feedback  loops,  the  number  of  turns
injected into the accumulator and the power efficiency
of the room temperature section. The input couplers of
the LEP cavities are already matched for this current.

The  linac  energy  of  2.2  GeV,  the  repetition  rate  of
75 Hz and the corresponding pulse length of 2.2 ms are
the  optimum  operating

conditions of the superconducting cavities and the need

 A  chopper  in  the  low  energy  section  is  used  to
minimise losses at injection in the accumulator and at
the  transfer  between  the  rings.  In  the  present  design,
42% of the beam is taken out at the chopper position,
leading  to  a  source  current  and  a  bunch  current  of
18 mA.  This  value  is  within  reach  of  present  H–
sources  and  is  well  below  the  limits  of  space-charge
dominated beam dynamics.

The layout of the linac is shown in Figure 4 and key

data are given in Table 2.

The  LEP  RF  frequency  of  352  MHz  has  been
maintained  for  the  whole  linac.  The  choice  of  this
frequency  for  the  low-beta  superconducting  cavities
that  have  to  be  built  for  the  SPL  allows  to  apply  the
sputtering fabrication technique to the cavity and to use
couplers and cut-off tubes recuperated from LEP units.
This  frequency  provides  the  additional  flexibility
that  klystron  or  tetrode  amplifiers  can  be  used  in  the
RF system. Klystrons can feed the high-power cavities

a  limited  number  of  cavities  connected  to  the  same

instead, feed the low-beta  superconducting  cavities,  thus
avoiding  the  potential  dangers  at  low  beam  energy  of  a
field stabilisation based on the vector sum of many cavity
signals.

Keeping  beam  losses  below  the  limit  for  hands-on
maintenance  (1  W/m)  has  been  a  design  issue  from  the
beginning. The main principles were a design of the linac
optics  without  excessive 
focusing
parameters, to avoid the formation of halo from mismatch
at  the  transitions,  a  particular  care  to  avoid  crossing
resonances, and finally, the preference for large apertures
in spite of some reductions in shunt impedance. Wherever
possible, losses will  be  concentrated  on  localised  dumps
by means of collimators.

4.2 Room Temperature Section

The  design  source  current,  18  mA,  is  well  within  the
range  of  existing  H–  sources,  while  the  required  pulse
length and duty cycle are more challenging as compared
to  existing  sources.  Reliability  is  also  an  important
concern. The study of an H– ECR source that could meet
the  SPL  parameters  has  been  started,  and  collaborations
are envisaged.

The fast chopper (2 ns rise time) at 2 MeV could be a
travelling-wave  stripline  structure  similar  to  the  LANL
design [13]. An analysis of the options for the 1 kV pulse
amplifier  indicates  that  a  combination  of  vacuum  tubes
driven by fast Mosfets could provide the required rise and
fall times [14]; this will be tested on a prototype.

The  DTL  starts  at  7  MeV,  and  is  composed  of  two
standard  Alvarez  tanks  up  to  an  energy  of  18  MeV,
followed  by  a  section  of  Side-Coupled  DTL  (SCDTL)
[15], 2-gap tanks connected by off-axis coupling cavities,
with  quadrupoles  placed  between  tanks.  The  352 MHz
structure going up to 120 MeV is made of 98 small tanks
grouped in 9 chains, each one powered by a klystron [16].

4.3 Superconducting Section

The  superconducting  part  of  the  linac  is  composed  of
four sections made of cavities designed for b
 of 0.52, 0.7,
0.8  and  1  respectively.  The  LEP-2  cavities  are  used  at
energies above 1 GeV. The cavities at b =0.52 and b =0.7
contain 4 cells, whilst the beta 0.8 cavities are made of 5
cells, to re-use the existing LEP cryostats.

The  main  parameters  of  the  superconducting  section
are summarised in Table 3. It has been assumed that the
LEP  cavities  will  operate  at  7.5  MV/m,  while  for  the
newly-built 
to
achieve  high  gradients  can  be  applied  and  a  design
gradient  of  9  MV/m  can  be  foreseen.  During  tests,  a
b =0.8 cavity has already reached gradients of  10  MV/m
[17]. The transition energies between sections are defined

b =0.8  cavities,  cleaning  procedures 

in  order  to  have  the  maximum  effective  accelerating
gradient and to minimise phase slippage.

The  cavities  at  b =0.7  and  b =0.8  can  be  built  of
niobium  sputtered  on  copper.  This  technique,  developed
at  CERN,  has  many  advantages  with  respect  to  bulk
Niobium for large productions:
a) 

the cost of the raw material is much lower, giving the
possibility  to  go  for  low  frequencies  where  the  iris
aperture is large,  relaxing  the  mechanical  tolerances
and reducing the probability of beam losses;

b)  Nb/Cu  cavities  can  be  operated  at  4.5 °K  with  Q-
factors  of  more  than  109,  simplifying  the  design  of
the cryostats and of the power coupler;
the excellent mechanical properties of copper ensure
a better thermal and mechanical stability.

c) 

A  development  programme  was  started  at  CERN  in
1996  to  investigate  the  feasibility  of  the  production  of
cavities in the b
 range 0.5–0.8. The main results are the
prototypes of a 5-cell b =0.8 cavity and of a 4-cell b =0.7
cavity (shown in Fig. 5), that  have  achieved  satisfactory
Q-values  at  high  gradient  (Fig.  6)  [18,19].  Attempts  to
sputter cavities at b <0.7 were not successful, thus the 42
cavities at b =0.52 have to be made of bulk niobium.

Figure 5: The prototype 4-cell b =0.7 cavity

Particular  attention  has  been  given  to  the  pulsed
operation of the superconducting cavities. Feedback loops
are foreseen  to  minimise  the effect  on  the  beam  of
cavity vibrations and of Lorentz forces. In the b =0.8 and
b =1  sections,  where  one  klystron  feeds  4  and  6  cavities
respectively,  the  compensation  has  to  be  made  on  the
vector sum. Simulations show that random oscillations of
the  cavity  frequency  of  up  to  40  Hz  amplitude  can  be
tolerated,  without  increasing  the  energy  spread  of  the
beam  outside  the  ±  10  MeV  corresponding  to  the
acceptance of the accumulator [20].

4.4  Layout on the CERN site

After considering some possible locations for the SPL
around the CERN Meyrin site, the option shown in Fig. 7
has  been  retained.  Placing  the  linac  and  the  parallel
klystron  gallery  in  an  area  immediately  outside  of  the
CERN fence on the Swiss side offers the advantages of an
economic  trench  excavation,  of  minimum  impact  on  the
environment  (the  site  is  presently  an  empty  field),  of  a
simple connection to the ISR tunnel and to the PS through
existing  tunnels,  and  of  an  easy  access  from  the  road
along the fence.

The  infrastructure  for  electricity,  water  cooling  and
cryogenics makes a maximum use of existing facilities on
the Meyrin site.

5  CONCLUSIONS

About 40% of the LEP-2 cavities, 57% of the cryostats
and all the klystrons plus other RF and HV equipment can
be  used  to  construct  a  2.2  GeV  H–  linear  accelerator  on
the  CERN  site  that  would  improve  the  beam  brightness

and  intensity  of  the  PS  ring,  provide  a  flexible  and
powerful beam source for a second generation radioactive
beam  facility  and  constitute  the  first  step  towards  a
powerful Neutrino Factory.

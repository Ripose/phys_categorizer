Abstract:  We  present  an  optical  interference  model  to  create  chiral 
microstructures (spirals) and its realization on photoresist using holographic 
lithography.  The model is based on the interference of six equally-spaced 
circumpolar  linear  polarized  side  beams  and  a  circular  polarized  central 
beam.  The pitch and separation of the spirals can be varied by changing the 
angle between the side beams and the central beam.  The realization of the 
model is carried out using the 325 nm line of a He-Cd laser and spirals of 
sub-micron size are fabricated on photoresist.

1. Introduction 

Microstructures  that  exhibit  photonic  bandgap  in  which  light  with  frequency  inside  the 
bandgap cannot propagate have posted many challenges to experimentalists, especially in the 
visible range [1, 2].  Despite progresses made in various techniques, like the self-assembly of 
micro-spheres [3], layer by layer micro-fabrication [4], and photo-lithography [5], it is still not 
easy  to  achieve  large  3D  complete  bandgap.  Recently,  it  was  pointed  out  by  Chutinan  and 
Noda  that  spiral,  which  breaks  the  chiral  symmetry  and  resembles  the  classical  diamond 
structure for photonic crystals (Lin et al. in Ref. [4]), can exhibit large 3D complete bandgaps 
[6].    Toader  and  John  later  also  took  this  approach  by  introducing  a  new  square  spiral 
photonic crystal [7].  Interestingly, Pendry showed recently that chiral structures can also lead 
to negative refraction [8].  With all the above findings, it is highly desirable to fabricate chiral 
(spiral) microstructures to confirm their predictions. 

Two  methods  developed  recently,  the  glancing  angle  deposition  (GLAD)  [9]  and  the 
multi-photon direct laser writing (DLW) [10], are well suited for fabricating chiral structures.  
In the GLAD method columnar structures are obtained by physical vapor deposition, in which 
vapor flux arrives at an oblique angle with respect to the normal of a 2D patterned substrate.  
The shadowing effects of the columns ensure the growth at chosen sites and by rotating the 
substrate  during  deposition  spirals  can  be  fabricated  [11].    The  DLW  method  utilizes  the 
multi-photon  absorption  and  pin-pointed  focusing  of  laser  light  using  high  magnification 
objective to write directly onto photoresist.  The frequency of the laser light is chosen below 
the single-photon polymerization threshold of the photoresist such that no polymerization can 
occur  at  off-focus  regions.    However  at  the  sharp  focal  point  the  intensity  of  the  laser  light 
may exceed the threshold for multi-photon absorption, leading to local polymerization of size 
as  small  as  120nm.    Thus  by  manipulating  the  substrate  with  respect  to  the  laser  light  with 
precision  movements  controlled  computer,  3D  pre-designed  patterns  can  be  written  directly 
onto the photoresist [10].  Micro-sized square spirals have been fabricated recently using the 
DLW method [12].  Despite the fact that large 3D bandgaps are obtained for spirals fabricated 
using  the  above  two  methods,  there  are  limitations  [11,  12].    In  the  GLAD  method  high 
quality and sub-micron size are still not easy to achieve while the DLW method is limited to 
small  sample  size,  ~tens  of  micrometers,  and  is  rather  time  consuming.    Furthermore,  the 
bandgaps are in the IR range only. 

  It  is  known  that  holographic  lithography  (HL),  a  method  combining  holography  and 
photo-induced  polymerization  techniques,  can  produce  uniform  periodic  as  well  as  quasi-
periodic large 3D structures on photoresist in the optical range [5,13].  The HL method is very 
flexible and is good for fabricating various microstructures.  We demonstrate in this paper the 
fabrication of chiral microstructures by exploiting the HL method to include circular polarized 
light  beam  as  compared  to  linear  polarized  beams  in  previous  HL  studies  [5].    Submicron 
spiral  structures  are  fabricated  on  photoresist  using  six  circumpolar  linear  polarized  side 
beams  and  one  circular  polarized  central  beam,  6+1  configuration,  from  a  UV  light  source.  
This method offers new opportunities for fabricating photon bandgap materials.

In this model, ϕ,

n, and δn are the control parameters after choosing the light source.  
For a fixed incident angle ϕ and equal beam intensity, ωn and δn are the only free parameters.  
While ωn is easily controlled by polarizer, δn is more involved.  It turns out that the phase of 
the central beam only shifts the pattern along z-axis thus does not need any adjustment.  For 
the six phases of the side beams, four of them can be arbitrarily set to zero because it is the 
difference of the phases that determines the final pattern, leaving only two phases as free.

Figure  2  shows  the  perspective  top  view  of  3D  intensity  contours  given  by Eq.  3 
using ϕ = 82.3o, En = 1 and δn = 0 for n = 0 - 6, ω0 = 45o, and ωn = 90o for n = 1 – 6 of well 
separated (a) left handed and (b) right handed spirals with aspect ratio ρ = 1.0 (l = x µm and a 
= x µm) .  Figures 2(c) and (d) show the corresponding side views of Figs. 2(a) and (b).  The 
chiral properties of the spirals are clearly shown.  The spirals will touch each other with the 
center hole also closed up for a low enough intensity cutoff.  Note that all the beams for Fig. 2 
are in phase.  It turns out that the quality of the spirals will be compromised when one of the 
size  beams  is  out  off  phase  with  the  other  beams.    Fortunately,  good  spirals  can  still  be 
obtained  for  phase  difference  as  large  as  60o  indicating  that  the  chance  of  getting  spiral 
structures is high.  This is confirmed by 200 realizations of random-phase simulations within 
which 32% of the trials still show good chiral appearance.  This ensures reasonable possibility 
of  getting  spirals  in  an  experiment  even  without  controlling  the  phases  of  the  beams.    Note 
that  triangular  “spirals”  with  the  no  central  hole,  in  contrast  to  the  6+1  system,  can  also  be 
obtained using a 3+1 configuration [14]. 

3. Experiment 

We  used  the  325  nm  line  of  a  He-Cd  laser  as  our  light  source.    The  seven  beams,  1.2  mm 
diameter, shown in Fig. 1 were obtained by splitting the laser beam using a grating.  The six 
side beams, placed symmetrically at 60o from neighboring beams around and making an angle 
37.7o  (corresponding  to  ϕ  =  21.2o  in  the  photoresist)  with  the  central  axis,  were  linearly 
polarized with directions ωn  = 90o for n = 1 – 6 by adjusting half-wave plates placed in the 
optical  paths.    The  central  beam,  placed  along  the  central  axis  as  shown  in  Fig.  1,  was 
converted  to  circular  polarized  using  a  ¼  wave  plate.    The  seven  beams  were  collimated  to 
interfere at the photoresist as shown in Fig. 1.  All seven beams were arranged to have roughly 
the  same  optical  path  without  optical  delays  for  simplicity.    In  principle,  the  phases  of  the 
beams  can  be  adjusted  by  adding  delay  optics  in  the  path  of  the  beams  to  get  the  required

values.  Neutral density filters were used to adjust the intensities of all the beams to about 80 
µW each. 

We  used  photoresist  SU8,  a  high  contrast  negative  resist  commonly  used  for  near  UV 
radiation, as the raw polymer resin.  SU8 resin was dissolved in γ-butyrolactone (1: 0.7 wt.) 
with 2% wt. of photoinitiator Irgacure 261 (from Ciba. Co.) to form the photoresist solution. 
The solution was spin coated on glass substrate to form ~15µm thick photoresist sample, after 
heated  to  ~90oC  for  about  an  hour  to  remove  any  solvent  left.    For  optimal  results,  the 
photoresist was exposed to the interference pattern for 3s.  A prism was placed on the top of 
the resin with matching fluid to lead away the interfering beams, preventing multi-reflections 
inside  the  resin  during  exposure.    This  arrangement  was  found  crucial  for  fabricating  good 
quality samples. 

After  the  exposure,  a  post  thermal  treatment  at  ~90oC  for  40  minutes  was  needed  to 
complete  the  polymerization  at  regions  where  the  dosage  from  the  interference  exceeded  a 
critical value. The under-exposed un-polymerized regions were then washed away by bathing 
the  sample  with  propyleneglycolmethylether  acetate  (>2  hours)  and  then  with  acetone  (~5 
minutes), leaving behind a copy of the interference pattern.

phase interference. 

 
Figures 3(a) and (b) show SEM images of columnar spirals fabricated on photoresist.  It 
was  found  that  the  photoresist  shrank  substantially  along  the  vertical  direction,  ~70%,  at 
regions  where  spirals  were  observed  while  normal  shrinkage  was  observed  at  non-spiral 
regions.  In contrast, there were un-noticeable changes on the xy-plane.  This may be due to 
the vertical stresses created in the spirals during the washing processes.  The aspect ratio of 
the spirals ρ  is about 1.4 (l ~ 0.9 µm and a ~ 0.65 µm), much less than ρ  = 4.7 (l = 2.9 µm 
and a = 0.62 µm) as given by the model.  Because of the non-uniformity of the laser beams, 
there  are regions  where  the phases do not  favor  the  formation  of spirals as  seen  at  the right 
hand side of Fig. 3(a) and in Fig. 3(c).  The spirals resemble the model well, similar to those 
shown  in  Fig.  1,  if  we  allow  for  a  shrinking  of  the  vertical  scale  of  the  model  by  70%.  
However, the spiral regions are unfortunately too small for any optical measurements to better 
characterize  the  chiral  property.    While  this  work  is  a  “proof-of-principle”  experiment  to 
demonstrate the creation of spiral structures using one-phonon interference, it is conceivable 
that  better  beam  quality  and  control  of  beam  phases  with  real  time  monitoring  of  the 
interference  pattern  can  give  larger  high  quality  samples  to  test  the  recently  predictions  of 
polarization gap in spiral structures [6-8, 15].

4. Conclusion 

We  have  fabricated  chiral  microstructures  by  holographic  lithography  using  a  six  linearly 
polarized  side  beams  and  one  circular  polarized  central  beam  setup.    Model  simulations  of 
both  right  and  left  handed  spiral  microstructures  can  be  obtained  for  a  wide  range  of 
parameters.  Realizations of the spiral microstructures are obtained on photoresist using a UV 
holographic  setup.    However,  the  samples  are  not  large  enough  for  optical  measurements.  
Better beam profiles and phase controls are need to make more uniform and larger samples to 
test the theoretical predictions.

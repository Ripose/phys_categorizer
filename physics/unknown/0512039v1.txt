Results of measurements of dependence 
supernovae  SNeIa carried out on the Hubble Space Telescope revealed failure 
of standard cosmological models for modern epoch of Universe evolution. In 
order to adjust the theoretical curve with experimental one in the frames of 
standard models it was necessary to change the Einstein equations. Selection of 
special value for cosmological  constant  L allowed to restore the harmony but in 
the frames of

density several times larger comparing with the average density of ordinary 
matter. According to the 
model negative pressure of dark energy 
caused accelerated expansion of the Universe. This induced the author to think 
more carefully about the bases of standard   cosmological models and propose 
another method for description of modern epoch of Universe in the frames of 
classic Einstein’s equations.

2.  BASIC PROPOSITIONS OF STANDARD MODELS 
 
            Let’s concentrate on the following basic propositions of standard cosmological models: 
            1. Space-time is homogeneous and isotropic. Its geometry is defined by quadratic form 
(Robertson 1933)

is described by stress-energy tensor of multicomponent perfect fluid filling the space with mass

3.  CRITICAL ANALISIS OF BASIC PROPOSITIONS OF STANDARD MODELS 
 
              States 2 and 3 are under doubt. State 2 replaces real matter distribution of the Universe 
by homogeneous multicomponent thermodynamic system. Such a replacement in cosmology is 
called matter “homogenization” (Weinberg 1972). State 3 for real matter distribution in Einstein 
equations is replaced by equations (2) for homogenized matter. These replacements need to be 
proved and can have a right to exist if they do not contradict observational data. 
             Einstein equations 
 
                                                 
 
are local and establish accurate equality between geometrical characteristic of space-time and 
energetic characteristic of gravitational field sources in  every point of space at every time. Here 
-T stress-energy tensor. Einstein and stress-
-g metric space-time tensor, 
-G Einstein tensor, 
energy tensors are defined on given metric tensor.    

                                                                      (9)

If we turn to the evolution of the Universe, then in the past we can conventionally 
distinguish several significantly different stages of evolution (Fig. 1). Probability of the Universe 
to be in stages C and B is quite high and follows from extrapolation into past of to known 
observational data: expansion of the Universe and non zero homogeneous isotropic CMB

radiation in the Universe at present time. Stage C 
is characterized by high temperature of 
gravitational field sources and high value of 
energy density, matter is the state of electrically 
neutral plasma. Due to the expansion of the 
Universe structure of the plasma changes with 
time from elemental particles of different types on                 
early stages of evolution C to electrons, neutrinos, 
hydrogen, helium, deuterium  atomic nucleus and 
other chemical elements on late stages.  Matter on 
that stage comprises the elements of future dark 
matter. As plasma and electromagnetic radiation 
were in thermodynamic equilibrium plasma 
should have homogeneous and isotropic mass and 
 from homogeneity. That is why it is possible to 
energy distribution with small deviation 
modulate right hand side of equations (9) by homogeneous equilibrium system in stage C.  Form 
(1) in this case is the one which reveals the symmetry – homogeneous and isotropy - of the left 
hand side of equations (9). Therefore, standard cosmological models adequately describe stage C 
in the evolution of the Universe.  
             Stage A radically differs from stage C. Distribution of gravitational filed sources is quite 
inhomogeneous in stage A. Here we have complicated system where defined enough and for sure 
possible to distinguish two thermodynamic phases and with under special conditions third phase1. 
Radiation phase stipulated mainly by CMB radiation occupies the most part of the Universe 
space. Relative value of local deviations from inhomogeneity is
             Stellar phase is an aggregate of stars and similar to them gravitationally tied local objects 
of the Universe. It is multiply connected and has quite precise bounds separating it from

galactic phase is

             Galaxies and galactic clusters are gravitationally tied local objects and have precise 
bounds. But the bounds of galactic phase do not coincide with the bounds of radiation phase. The 
bounds of radiation phase are surfaces of stellar phase and surfaces of ionized gas clouds inside 
galaxies. So separation of galactic phase is conventional and is due to convenience of analysis of 
space matter distribution. Exactly galactic phase constitute large-scale structure of the Universe 
                                                 
1Note that introduced here description of stages A and C of Universe evolution does not pretend to detail and 
accuracy of numbers. Matter distribution and its structure are simplified in the extent necessary and sufficient for 
drawing well-grounded conclusions about  correctness of application of Einstein equations in standard cosmological 
models  in the form (2a, b).

Second and third problems are connected with the first one.  Proof of equation (14) because of 
high degree of nonlinearity of function 
solved. To establish a connection between Einstein equations in the form of (9) or (12) and 
equations (2a, b) of standard models without proving equality (14) is not possible.

            Stage B of the evolution of the Universe is transitional. After recombination of negative 
and positive electric charges of plasma in stage C radiation phase separates from neutral matter, 
fluctuation of matter density increases and it structures. Description of dynamics of the matter in 
this stage demands kinetic methods and correspondingly transforms Einstein equations. 
Argumentation for applying standard models in stage B is even less with compared to stage A.  
 
 
 
4.  EVOLUTIONARY STAGE OF THE UNIVERSE 
 
           In the evolutionary stage A of the Universe we can distinguish quite definitely two forms 
of gravitationally tied objects comprising stellar and galactic phases with precise bounds. Denote

here   P - space-time event. 
            Equations (15a) and (15b) distinguish essentially from physical point of view. Mass 
density of matter in stellar phase exceeds value of mass density in galactic phase much more, and 
the last exceeds mass density of radiation phase.   That is why equations (15 а) define the role of 
gravitational field  in the intrinsic structure of stars, in motion of stars and another matter in the 
galaxies and motion of galaxies in galactic clusters relatively centre of inertia.   While 
homogeneous  radiation phase fills the whole space of the Universe. Let us affirm that qualitative 
and mostly quantitative characteristics of dynamics of the evolution of the Universe in stage A 
are defined by equations (15b). Centers of inertia of galactic clusters are at rest in the referenced 
frame co-moving by the radiation phase.   
 
 
 
5.   EINSTEIN EQUATIONS FOR RADIATION PHASE 
 
           Energy of radiation phase is continuously distributed in space and is not strictly 
homogeneous. There are two reasons of its inhomogeneity.  First reason – evolutionary. 
Fluctuations of energy density of plasma and electromagnetic field were  in stage C conserved by  
radiation phase after its separation from matter in stage B and transformed during expansion of 
the Universe. The other reason is the gravitational interaction of radiation phase with matter of 
galactic phase.   Inhomogeneous of radiation phase is not compatible with matter inhomogeneity 
in stellar and galactic phases in stage A because of equations (15с), sewing together gravitational

on the assumption that the observer and the object emitting light registered by the observer are at 
rest in the reference frame co-moving by  the radiation phase. Both the observer and object  
belong to the region mD , and light distributes in rD  region. Information about spectral lines shifts

           For comparison of theoretical function

 1. Baryonic and dark matter distribution in the modern epoch of the evolution of the 
Universe is not homogeneous. Therefore use of Einstein equations in the form traditionally used 
- can 
in standard cosmological models - since publication of Friedman’s papers (1922, 1924)   
not be acknowledged to be correct. Replacement of real matter and radiation distribution by 
“homogenized” matter – perfect fluid – in the right hand side of Einstein equations assumes 
corresponding averaging of left hand side.   Here is hidden the reason of impossibility to describe 
theoretically nonlinear dependence of function

the interval increases (measurements of photometric distances of more distant supernovae 
SNeIa)  we can expect new problems to appear.                               
 
           2. Standard models adequately describe evolutionary stage C of the Universe when real 
matter and radiation distribution under high temperature with high degree of precision are 
homogeneous equilibrium thermodynamic system. Alternative to standard models in stage A

including modern epoch is either transition from Einstein equations to averaged ones

by several order of magnitude the accuracy of modern measurements of dependence of   Ld on  z . 
It satisfactorily adjusts with the results of measurements (Riess et al. 1998; Garnavich et al.

Universe expansion in the modern epoch, evolutionary connection of stages A and C and formation of large-scale 
structure after separation of radiation phase from matter under temperature drop.

Necessity.  Equality  (A7b) follows from eq. (A8c). Equating now left hand sides of 
equations (A21b) and (A23b) to zero, according to eq. (A8f) and (A8h), and taking into account 
eq. (A8a), get

Taking into account lemma conditions (A7)  and equality (A20a) we can easily derive equalities 
(A8f, g, i) from eq. (A21)-(A24).

Note that space 

3R , according  (A8c), is homogeneous and isotropic.   Homogeneous 

component of radiation phase density energy   <
homogeneous   (A8i) kinematical functions correspond to it. That is why physical meaning of 
lemma is in the fact that conditions (A7) are sufficient and necessary for derivation of simple 
solution of equations (A5), which adjusts with isotropic and homogeneous component of its right 
hand side.

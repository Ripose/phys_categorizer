                Abstract      Recently, motivated by the pioneer works that reveal the small-world 

effect  and  scale-free  property  of  various  real-life  networks,  many  scientists  devote 

themselves into studying complex networks. One of the ultimate goals is to understand 

how the topological structures of networks affect the dynamics upon them. In this paper, 

we  give  a  brief  review  on  the  studies  of  epidemic  dynamics  on  complex  networks, 

including  the  description  of  classical  epidemic  models,  the  epidemic  spread  on 

small-world and scale-free networks, and network immunization. Finally, a prospect is 

addressed and some interesting problems are listed.

Many social, biological, and communication systems can be properly described as complex 

networks  with  nodes  representing  individuals  or  organizations  and  edges  mimicking  the 

interactions  among  them  [1-4].  For  example,  the  neural  system  can  be  considered  as  a  network 

consisted  of  neurons  connecting  through  neural  fiber  [5],  the  Internet  is  a  network  of  many 

autonomic computers connected by optic fiber or other communication media  [6]. The analogous 

examples are numerous: these include power grid networks [5], social networks [7-8], collaboration 

networks [9-10], traffic networks [11], and so on.   

In the past 200 years, the study of topological structures of the networks used to model the 

interconnection  systems  has  gone  through  three  stages.  For  over  a  century,  there  is  an  implicit 

assumption  that  the  interaction  patterns  among  the  individuals  can  be  embedded  onto  a  regular

structure  such  as  Euclidean  lattices,  hypercube  networks,  and  so  on  [12-13].  Since  late  1950s 

mathematicians  began  to  use  random  graphs  to  describe  the  interconnections,  this  is  the  second 

stage  [14-17].  In  the  past  few  years,  with  the  computerization  of  data  acquisition  process  and  the 

availability  of  high  computing  powers,  scientists  have  found  that  most  real-life  networks  are 

neither  completely  regular  nor  completely  random.  The  results  of  many  empirical  studies  and 

statistical analysis indicate that the networks in various fields have some common characteristics, 

the most important of which are called small-world effect [5, 18] and scale-free property [19-20].   

In a network, the distance between two nodes is defined as the number of edges along the 

shortest  path  connecting  them.  The  average  distance  L,  then,  is  defined  as  the  mean  distance 

between  two  nodes,  averaged  over  all  pairs  of  nodes.  The  number  of  the  edges  incident  from  a 

node x is called the degree of x, denoted by k(x). Obviously, through the k(x) edges, there are k(x) 

nodes that are correlated with x; these are called the neighbor-set of x, and denoted by A(x). The 

clustering coefficient C(x) of node x is the ratio between the number of edges among A(x) and the 

total  possible  number,  the  clustering  coefficient  C  of  the  whole  network  is  the  average  of  C(x) 

over all x. The regular networks have great clustering coefficient and long average distance, while 

the  random  networks  have  small  clustering  coefficient  and  short  average  distance.  In  the  year 

1998, Watts and Strogatz proposed a network model (WS networks), which can be constructed by 

starting with a regular network and randomly moving one endpoint of each edge with probability 

p  [5].  The  WS  networks  have  much  smaller  average  distance  than  regular  networks,  and  much 

greater  clustering  coefficient  than  random  networks.  The  recognition  of  small-world  effect 

involves the two factors mentioned above: a network is called a small-world network as long as it 

has  small  average distance and  great  clustering coefficient.  The previous empirical  studies  have 

demonstrated  that  most  real-life  networks  display  small-world  effect.  Another  important 

characteristic in real-life networks is the power-law degree distribution, that is p(k)～k-α, where k 

is the degree and p(k) is the probability density function for the degree distribution. α is called the 

power-law  exponent,  and  usually  between  2  and  3  in  real-life  networks.  This  power-law 

distribution falls off much more gradually than an exponential one, allowing for a few nodes of 

very  large  degree  to  exist.  Networks  with  power-law  degree  distribution  are  referred  to  as 

scale-free networks, although one may have scales present in other network properties.   

Most  of  the  previous  studies  on  epidemic  dynamics  are  based  on  regular  networks.  The 

corresponding conclusions now suffer the challenge of new statistical characters of networks. If 

the theoretical and empirical studies indicate the epidemic behavior on regular networks is almost 

the  same  as  on  small-world  and  scale-free  networks,  then  the  classical  conclusions  can  at  least 

provisionally  be  used  to  solve  practical  problems.  Hereinafter  we  will  show  that  the  epidemic 

dynamics are essentially different from those classical models. 

1.  Classical epidemic models 

In the classical theory of infectious diseases, the most extensively studies epidemic models 

are  the  susceptible-infected-removed  (SIR)  model  and  susceptible-infected-susceptible  (SIS) 

model [21-23]. In SIR model, the individuals are classified in three classes according to their states: 

susceptible  (will  not  infect  others  but  may  be  infected),  infected  (have  infectivity),  removed 

(recover  from  the  illness  and  have  immunity  thus  will  not  take  part  in  the  epidemic  process). 

Assume  that  a  susceptible  individual  will  be  infected  by  a  certain  infected  one  during  one  time 

step  with  probability  β,  and  the  recovering  rate  of  infected  ones  is  γ.  Then,  in  SIR  model,  the 

epidemic process can be described by the following equations:

d r

where  s,  i  and  r  denote  the  ratio  of  susceptible,  infected,  and  removed  individuals  to  the  whole 

population, respectively. However, in real epidemic spreading process, the susceptible individual 

will  be  infected  only  if  she  has  contacted  with  some  infected  ones.  Use  nodes  to  represent  the 

individuals, and link two individuals by an edge if they  may have some kind of contact. In this 

network, a susceptible node will be infected only if it has at least one infected neighbor. In this 

way, the classical epidemic models can be natural extended to the network epidemic models, and 

the Equs. (1) can be considered as a special case in which the corresponding network is a fully 

connected network. 

Grassberger  has  investigated  the  network  epidemic  behavior,  and  pointed  out  that  the 

network SIR model is equal to the bond-percolation problem [24] (see Grimmett’s book [25] for the 

details of percolation). This equipollence has recently been extended to a more general situation 

by  Sander  et al  [26].  Further  more,  if  β  and  γ in  Equs.  (1)  are  not constant  for all  the nodes,  but 

obey the distributions Pi(β) and Pr(γ), Newman proved that the network SIR model is equal to the 

bond-percolation with occupied rate [27]:

So,  if  the  network  structure  is  given,  and  the  method  to  determine  Pi(β)  and  Pr(γ)  from  the 

topology  is  known,  then  the  solution  of  corresponding  network  SIR  model  can  be  obtained  in 

principle.   

The SIR model is not suitable when the individuals cannot acquire immunity after recovering 

from  the  disease,  such  disease  as  influenza,  pulmonary  tuberculosis,  and  gonorrhea.  The  SIS 

model  is  often  used  for  these  cases,  which  is  very  similar  to  SIR  model.  The  only  difference 

between them is that in SIS model, the infected individuals will return to the susceptible state after 

recovering, while in SIR model, they will be removed. Hence in SIS model, corresponds to Equs. 

(1), we have:

Unfortunately, no accurate analytic solution is available like Equ. (2) for network SIS model.   

By  using  the  mean-field  theory,  Pastor-Satorras  and  Vespignani  obtained  an  approximate 

solution for network SIS model [28-30]. Denote pk the probability that a randomly picked node is of 

degree k, λ the probability that a susceptible individual will be infected by an infected one during 

one  time  step,  and 

( )λΘ   the  probability  that  any  give  edge  points  to  an  infected  node.  They 

obtained the famous equation:

2.  Epidemic spread in small-world networks 

Moore and Newman investigate the epidemics in Newman-Watts networks  [31-32], which are 

the small-world networks similar to WS networks. The difference is that in NW networks, only 

the  shortcuts  are  added  and  no  edges  are  rewired.  They  consider  the  SIR  process  as  a  site 

percolation. Denote  φ  the ratio of the number of shortcuts to Nk, where 2k is the average degree 

of the original one-dimensional lattice and N is the number of nodes; they yield the expression of 

the percolation threshold pc:

Further  more,  they  investigate the bond percolation in  NW  networks,  and prove that  when k=1, 

the  thresholds  of  site  and  bond  percolation  are  the  same.  By  using  the  method  of  generating 

functions, they yield the threshold for bond percolation in the case k=2:

They also obtain the exact solution of mixed (site & bond) percolation [33], which is now widely 

applied  in  the  studies  of  network  immunization.  The  spreading  behavior  of  SIR  model  in  high 

dimensional small-world networks is also reported by Newman, Jensen and Ziff [34].   

        Kuperman  and  Abramson  study  the  SIRS  model  on  WS  networks  [35],  that  is  to  say,  the 

immune  time  for  individuals  is  finite  thus  there  exists  a  transition  from  removed  state  to 

susceptible state. They find that even when the rewiring probability p is very small (p=0.01), the 

disease can exist permanently with very small infected ratio and almost no fluctuations, and when 

p  gets  larger  (p=0.9),  the  period  oscillations  of  the  number  of  infected  individuals  appear.  In 

addition,  the  phase  transition  from  non-synchronization  to  synchronization  phase  is  observed  as 

the  increase  of  p.  Based  on  Kuperman  and  Abramson’s  work,  Agiza  et  al  study  the  phase 

transitions  of  some  modified  SIRS  models,  and  find  that  the  epidemic  region  is  larger  for 

small-world networks than regular ones [36].   

Very  recently,  Xiong  investigates  a  modified  SIR  model  on  WS  networks,  in  which  the 

delitescence  is  introduced  [37].  Both  the  short-term  oscillations  and  long-term  saturation  are 

observed  for  different  form  and  parameters  of  the  distribution  function  for  the  length  of 

delitescence. The obtained results may provide insights into the characteristics of oscillations and 

a prognosis of a spreading process in closed system. Another interesting issue is the interplay of 

the  epidemic  dynamics  and  network  structures  [38],  which  may  become  a  rich  field  in  the  future 

studies on network epidemic dynamics.   

3.  Epidemic spread in scale-free networks 

In  SIS  models  with  local  connectivity  (Euclidean  lattices)  and  random  graphs,  the  most 

significant result is the general prediction of a nonzero epidemic threshold λc

 [22]. If the value of λ 

is  above  the  threshold,  λ>λc,  the  infection  spreads  and  becomes  persistent.  Below  it,  λ<λc,  the 

infection dies out exponentially fast. According to this classical conclusion above, since the ratio 

of  infected  individuals  is  positive  correlated  with  λ,  if  the  disease  exists  persistently,  it  must 

infected  large  amount  of  individuals.  However,  the  empirical  data  show  that  many  diseases  can 

persistently exist with just a tiny fraction of population being infected, such as computer virus and 

measles [39-40]. By using mean-field theory, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani obtained the epidemic 

threshold of SIS dynamics in general networks [28-30]: 

                                                           

                                                      (7)

threshold  in  scale-free  networks  provides  a  well  explanation  for  the  empirical  data  [39-40], 

exhibiting completely new scenarios of epidemic propagation.   

The Equ. (7) is only in point of non-assortative networks like BA networks [41]. Since many 

real-life  networks  show  assortative  or  disassortative  mixing,  it  is  valuable  to  study  how  the 

degree-degree correlation patterns (assortative, non- assortative, or disassortative) affect epidemic 

dynamics.  Boguna  and  Pastor-Satorras  yield  the  epidemic  threshold  of  SIS  model  in  assortative 

networks [42-43]: 

                                                                       

                                                              (8)

prove  that  if  <k

mΛ → ∞ ,  that  is  to  say,  the 

epidemic  threshold  is  absent  in  scale-free  networks  no  matter  what  degree-degree  correlation 

patterns  they  have.  The  similar  conclusion  of  SIR  model  in  assortative  networks  has  also  been 

reported [44]. 

respectively.   

May and Lloyd firstly point out that the finite size of scale-free networks will lead to positive 

epidemic threshold [45]. Soon, Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani yield the quantitative result [46]:

        The majority of studies are based on the low clustering scale-free networks, whose clustering 

coefficients  are  very  small  and  decrease  with  the  increasing  of  network  size  like  BA  networks. 

However,  the  demonstration  exhibits  that  most  real-life  networks  have  large  clustering 

coefficients mo matter how many nodes they have. Zhou, Yan and Wang compare the behaviors of 

susceptible-infected (SI) process on BA networks and high clustering scale-free networks [47]. The 

simulation results indicate that the large clustering coefficients may slow the spreading velocity, 

especially in the outbreaks. 

Barthélemy  et  al  report  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the  epidemic  spreading  behavior  in  the 

outbreaks for network SI model [48]. They find that in scale-free networks, the epidemic dynamics 

of SI model have an obviously hierarchical structure, the nodes of larger degree are preferentially 

infected,  and  then  the  nodes  with  lower  degree.  Yan  et  al  investigate  the  SI  process  in  Barrat- 

Barthélemy-Vespignani (BBV) networks  [49], the recently proposed weighed scale-free networks, 

in  which  the  edge  weights  denote  the  familiarity  between  to  individuals.  It  is  found  that  the 

spreading velocity reaches a peak quickly after outbreaks, and then decays in a power-low form. 

By numerical study, they also demonstrate that larger dispersion of weight of networks results in 

slower spreading [50]. 

4.  Network immunization 

An interesting and practical problem is whether the epidemic propagation can be effectively 

controlled  by  vaccination  aiming  at  part  of  the  population.  As  mentioned  in  section  one,  the 

network SIR model is equal to the bond percolation; and clearly, vaccination for individual can be 

considered as the site percolation. Hence the immunization problem on network SIR model equals 

to mixed percolation. Callway et al obtain an analytic solution for genetic mixed percolation by 

using mean-field theory [51]. The solution gives expression to the effect of vaccination at randomly 

chosen individuals. In practice, it is usually very hard to know the number of individuals who may 

contact with a certain infected one. Cohen et al design an efficient immunization strategy named 

“acquaintance  immunization”,  which  can  avoid  accounting  the  nodes’  degree  [52].  The  proposed 

strategy  contains  two  processes,  first  some  nodes  are  randomly  chosen,  and  then  their  random 

acquaintances are vaccinated. Since the nodes with larger degree have greater chance to be chosen 

than  those  small  degree  ones  [53],  the  acquaintance  immunization  performs  much  better  than 

random immunization especially in scale-free networks. Some immunization strategies similar to 

Cohen’s, such as “contact vaccination” [54] and “ring vaccination” [55-56], have already been widely 

applied in clinic. 

Pastor-Satorras  and  Vespignani  investigate  the  network  immunization  for  SIS  model  [57]. 

They propose the so-called “targeted immunization schemes”, which means to vaccinate the nodes 

with larger degree firstly. They prove that, the whole population must get vaccinated if one wants 

to effectively control the epidemic propagation by using random immunization strategy. While if 

the targeted immunization schemes are used, the critical immunization threshold will decay to:

Dezsö  and  Barabási  proposed  a  preferential  immunization  strategy,  where  the  probability  that  a 

certain  node  is  chosen  to  be  vaccinated  is  proportional  to  its  degree  [58].  Pastor-Satorras  and 

Vespignani yield the corresponding critical immunization threshold [57]:

Recently, Hayashi et al consider the linear growing scale-free networks, and find that if one 

wants  to  control  the  disease  spread,  he  must  restrain  the  population  from  increasing  [59].  This 

conclusion  is  significant  for  controlling  epizooties.  Dybiec  et  al  study  how  to  control  disease 

spread  on  networks  with  incomplete  knowledge,  and  design  an  effective  local  method,  whose 

performance is very sensitive to the ken [60].   

5.  Summary 

The studies of network epidemic dynamics are now in the ascendant. Many new discoveries, 

especially the role of network heterogeneity that can strongly enhance the infection’s incidence, 

provide us the completely new scenarios of epidemic propagation. Not only physicists bring the 

new object named “complex networks”, but also the new methodologies into epidemiology. As an 

end of this brief review, we list a few interesting problems below. 

The classical theory of infectious diseases does not care about the network topology. There 

are  still  many  problems  under  debating,  such  problems  as  whether  the  external  factors  or  the 

factors intrinsic to pathogen are more important in determining epidemic behavior, and why some 

dynamics  of  diseases  display  oscillation-like  behaviors  or  synchronization  [61-62].  We  wonder  if 

considering  the  role  of  network  topology  will  give  some  more  powerful  explanations  on  these 

problems. 

Most of the previous studies of immunization require the global information of networks that 

is usually unavailable. Therefore, to design immunization strategy using only local information is 

significant  in  practice.  In  addition,  all  the  previous  vaccination  algorithms  are  off-line;  will  the 

on-line algorithms work better? 

Up  to  now,  only  few  works  hold  the  spreading  velocity  in  high  regard.  However,  the 

spreading velocity is a very important measure especially in the outbreaks. The question is how 

the network structure affects the spreading velocity, and how to reduce it?   

Some  in-depth  analyses  of  structures  exhibit  many  new  sights  of  networks  like  the 

community  structures,  the  hierarchical  properties,  and  so  on.  Will  these  characters  affects  the 

epidemic behaviors?

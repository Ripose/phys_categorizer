ABSTRACT 

 

 

 

Unusual scattering effects from tiny spherical particles may be obtained when concentric shells are designed by 

pairing 

together  “complementary”  double-negative 

(DNG),  single-negative 

(SNG),  and/or  standard 

double-positive  (DPS)  materials.  By  embedding  these  highly  polarizable  scatterers  in  a  host  medium  one  can 

achieve  a  bulk  medium  with  interesting  effective  parameters.  Some  physical  insights  and  justifications  for  the 

anomalous  polarizability  of  these  concentric  spherical  nano-particles  and  the  effective  parameters  of  the  bulk 

composite medium are discussed.

INTRODUCTION 

Double Negative (DNG) materials [1], also known as “left-handed” or “negative-index” media [2], are receiving 

increasing  attention  in  the  scientific  community  in  recent  years,  due  to  the  exciting  properties  of  the  wave 

interaction  with  these  materials  [1]-[21].  These  features  are  consequences  of  the  negative  real  part  of  their 

permittivity  and  permeability,  which  may  be  obtained  by  properly  selecting  and  embedding  some  resonant 

inclusions in a host medium [3]. 

In our previous works, we have shown how ultracompact waveguides and resonators [4]-[6], anomalous wave 

tunneling  and  transparency  [7]-[8]  or  dramatic  enhancement  of  scattering  from  tiny  spheres  and  cylinders 

[8]-[10] may be achieved when these materials are paired with conventional media (which, by analogy, can be 

referred to as “double positive (DPS)” materials). We have also shown that similar effects may be obtained using 

materials with just one of the two parameters being negative. These include ε-negative (ENG)  media (such as 

plasmonic  media)  or  the  µ-negative  (MNG)  media,  which  possess,  respectively,  permittivity  and  permeability 

with a negative real part [5]-[10]. Again, when these two “conjugate” materials are judiciously paired together, 

the  wave  interaction  shows  anomalous  properties.  In  those  works,  in  particular,  we  have  discussed  how  these 

anomalies may be explained as the effects due to the interface resonance taking place at the junction of materials 

with oppositely-signed constitutive parameters [7]. 

In one of our previous works [9], moreover, we have mentioned that when two concentric spherical nanoshells 

(or  coaxial  cylindrical  nanoshells)  made  of  DPS-DNG  materials,  or  ENG-MNG,  or  even  ENG-DPS  or 

MNG-DPS materials, are suitably paired together, the overall scattering cross section of this tiny structure may 

be  dramatically  enhanced,  as  compared  with  the  scattering  from  an  object  with  the  similar  shape  and  size  but 

made of standard DPS media only. In other words, one can obtain electrically small scatterers with a scattering 

cross  section  comparable  with  that  of  much  larger  scatterers.  This  implies  that  we  can  effectively  have  a 

“compact resonator”, i.e., an electrically small object in resonance. This phenomenon, again, may be explained 

using the concept of interface resonance when these conjugate materials are paired together. 

In the present work, first we briefly discuss the general analysis of electromagnetic wave scattering from such

spherical  nanoparticles  and  their  unusual  scattering  properties,  highlighting  the  relationship  between  these 

scattering phenomena and the material polaritons, i.e., the natural modes supported by these particular scatterers. 

Other  research  groups  have  presented  experimental  results  demonstrating  these  anomalous  resonances  in 

individual  particles  containing  plasmonic  materials,  and  have  discussed  certain  theoretical  aspects  (e.g., 

hybridization) of this phenomenon [22]-[28]. Here, we give some other (different) features of the theory behind 

such scattering, and we then suggest the idea of embedding these tiny resonant particles with high polarizability 

as  inclusions  in  a  host  material,  in  order  to  conceptually  build  a  bulk  composite  medium,  which  may  exhibit 

interesting characteristics with potential applications. The “compact resonant” inclusions, in fact, offer very high 

polarizabilities without occupying a large footprint, and consequently they may be easily embedded in a matrix 

array  to  produce  an  effective  hybrid-metamaterial  (i.e.,  a  metamaterial  whose  inclusions  may  themselves  be 

made of composite materials) with anomalous properties. 

SCATTERING PROPERTIES OF INDIVIDAL METAMATERIAL NANOINCLUSIONS 

The  geometry  of  the  single  inclusion  under  study  here  is  depicted  in  Fig.  1.  This  is  a  spherical  scatterer 

composed of two concentric layers of radii 

1a ,  a , with 

a

a>
1

, surrounded by a host material (with permittivity 

0ε   and  permeability 

0µ ),  which  may  not  necessarily  be  free  space.  Let  this  scatterer  be  illuminated  by  an 

i

t

e ω− − monochromatic  plane  wave.  The  concentric  layers  are  assumed  to  be  made  of  isotropic  homogenous 

materials, which at the operating frequency 

f ω π

/ 2

=

  have permittivities 

1ε , 

2ε   and permeabilities 

1µ , 

2µ , 

as indicated in the figure. In general, the constitutive parameters of the three material regions should be complex 

quantities, taking into account the possible material losses. Moreover, their real parts may be positive or negative, 

giving  rise  to  the  possibility  of  having  DPS,  DNG,  ENG  or  MNG  materials,  as  discussed  in  the  introduction. 

Since  the  media  are  supposed  to  be  passive,  their  imaginary  parts  are  non-negative.  Furthermore,  in  the 

following we assume lossless or low-loss conditions, i.e.,  Im

  and  Im

, (

j =

). 

Strictly  speaking,  every  material  except  the  free  space  exhibits  temporal  dispersion,  and  particularly 

metamaterials in the range of frequencies in which they display negative parameters may be strongly dispersive 

 

 

3

[1]-[3],  [29].  Therefore,  in  the  following  discussion  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  we  consider  a  monochromatic 

excitation,  which  allows  the  analysis  to  be  performed  for  given  values  of  the  constitutive  parameters  at  this 

specific  frequency.  The  results  for  a  single  frequency  may  be  promptly,  but  approximately,  extended  to  a 

quasi-monochromatic case, typical of the telecommunication applications. In the next section, moreover, we will 

consider certain dispersion model for some metamaterials and plasmonic media. 

Let  an  illuminating  plane  wave  be  propagating  along  the  ˆz   axis  of  the  Cartesian  coordinate  system  ( ,

, )
x y z  

with its electric field directed along the  ˆx   axis. The scatterer is centered at the origin of this Cartesian and of a 

spherical coordinate system  ( ,

r θ ϕ . As it is usually done, this plane wave can be written in terms of electric 

)

,

and  magnetic  vector  potentials  that  are  then  expanded  into  spherical  harmonics  in  the  spherical  coordinate 

system [30]-[31]:

square  roots  in  the  different  types  of  media,  depending  on  the  sign  of  the  real  part  of  permittivity  and 

permeability, is given in Table 1. For each type of medium, this has been obtained by adding an infinitesimally 

small amount of loss into the medium constitutive parameters, and then choosing the correct branch cut for the 

square roots in order to satisfy the radiation condition, as was similarly done for the DNG medium in [1].   

Obviously, due to the linearity of the problem one may separately analyze the contribution of every term in the

two summations. In particular, the series for the magnetic vector potential 

incA   is composed of spherical 

rTM  

waves  and  analogously  the  electric  potential 

incF   is  represented  by  a  summation  of 

rTE   waves.  (The 

superscript “r” will be dropped heretoafter for simplicity.)   

This scattering problem is analogous to the one solved by Aden and Kerker [33], even though in their paper they 

have assumed to deal with conventional materials only (which we call DPS media). Their solution, however, is 

also  applicable  to  the  cases  under  study  here,  provided  that  the  correct  choice  for  the  signs  of  the  quantities

In this work we are mostly interested in the field scattered by the particle (since from that we can evaluate the 

polarizabilities of this inclusion, to be embedded in a host matrix to form a bulk medium), which is determined 

for each spherical wave by the corresponding vector potential:

It is worth noting that the vector potentials

  and 

( )

  of the scattered fields given in  (3)  represent the 

potentials  for  the  radiation  field  of  an  electric  and  a  magnetic  multipole  of  order  n ,  respectively,  and  the 

expressions given in  (4), therefore, are equivalent to a multipole expansion [35]. This issue will be revisited later 

in the manuscript. 

For  the  scattering  coefficients

one given in [33], may be obtained by manipulating the equations written for the boundary conditions at

Analogous expressions for the TE polarization may be obtained by substituting  ε  with  µ  into  (8)  and  (9).   

Expressions  (7)  show  that 

nc ≤   and  their  peaks,  which  correspond  to  the  scattering  resonances  for  the

structure,  occur  when 

nV =   for  the  lossless  materials.  As  in  the  case  of  a  homogeneous  scatterer  [34],  these

peaks are related to the presence of material polaritons (i.e., natural modes) on the surface of the scatterer, which 

are  responsible  of  the  scattering  resonances.  In  fact,

dispersion relations for the TE and TM material polaritons for this scatterer, which may be obtained using the 

alternative technique proposed in [36], but applied here to this two-layer problem. (For a brief discussion about 

this technique for finding the resonant material polaritons for this structure and their physical relation with the 

scattering peaks, see Appendix A.) 

When conventional DPS materials are considered, it is well known that such resonances (and the corresponding 

high scattering) may be obtained only when the size of the scatterer becomes comparable to the wavelength in 

the media [34]. Of course, this is due to the fact that all the material polaritons are below cut off when the size of 

the scatterer is less than a given dimension (similarly to what happens in an electrically small cavity), and as a 

result a small DPS scatterer leads to a large negative value of 

nV   (as confirmed by Eq.  (11)), and thus a very 

low value for 

nc . Moreover, since 

lim

ones with

)  arg

, following  (7). When the size of the scatterer is increased, on the other hand, the 

magnitude  of 

nc   increases  up  to  the  resonance,  which  arises  when  the  polariton  is  supported  and 

V Disp

n

0

nc = −   (with a 
1

/ 2π   phase shift typical of any resonance phenomenon). 

If instead of the DPS materials for all the media involved in the problem we consider a combination of DNG, 

SNG, and/or DPS metamaterials for the two layers in the geometry of Fig. 1, may this lead to unusual scattering 

properties, e.g., huge scattering resonances for such electrically small scatterers? In our previous works, we have 

theoretically  verified  how  pairing  conjugate  (i.e.,  complementary)  materials  (i.e.,  materials  with  oppositely 

signed  constitutive  parameters)  may  indeed  lead  to  the  possibility  of  significant  reduction  in  the  lateral 

dimension  of  guided  modes  in  planar  and  cylindrical  waveguides  and  cavities  [4]-[9].  In  particular,  we  have 

shown  that  their  dispersion  relations  in  several  different  waveguide  configurations  filled  by  two  of  such 

conjugate materials do not depend on the sum of the thickness of the two regions, as it is the case for the usual 

waveguides,  but  on  the  ratio  of  thicknesses,  implying  the  possibility  of  having  sub-wavelength  structures 

supporting  guided  modes  with  lateral  dimension  below  the  diffraction  limitation  [4]-[9].  These  phenomena 

 

7

would indeed correspond to resonant modes in ultracompact  cavities/waveguides, and we have explained how 

these resonances are directly related to pairing of such conjugate materials, and how they arise at the interface 

between them. In the present problem, an analogous situation is present: from the above analysis it follows that 

we  should  simply  look  for  the  possibility  of  support  of  resonant  material  polaritons  by  the  nanospherical 

scatterers formed by a pair of DNG, SNG and/or DPS layers, even when their dimensions are much smaller than 

those required for the spheres made of standard DPS materials. It is worth noting how in [11] a similar goal has 

been achieved with a different technique, namely, increasing the effective material parameters (i.e., having high 

permittivity and/or high permeability) of the small scatterer, and thus decreasing the effective wavelength inside 

the  material  in  order  to  make  it  comparable  with  its  physical  dimensions  (In  the  cavity  analogy  this  approach 

would correspond to filling the cavity with a high-permittivity material in order to make it resonant at a lower 

frequency).  Of  course,  this  process  may  be  limited  by  the  possibility  of  such  an  increase  in  the  material 

parameters,  i.e.,  a  too  small  scatterer  would  require  very  high  constitutive  parameters  and  a  geometrical 

limitation  may  always  be  present.  Moreover,  constructing  materials  with  very  high  permittivities  and/or 

permeabilities, which are often lossy, may involve certain technological challenges. In our approach, however, 

we will show below that, at least in principle, this physical limit may be overcome by exploiting the “resonant” 

pairing of the DNG, SNG, and/or DPS metamaterials, as already done in the other situations mentioned above, 

and at the same time the values of the constitutive parameters (and correspondingly their imaginary parts) do not 

need to be necessarily high. 

For this purpose, let us analyze what happens when the size of the scatterer becomes very small, compared to the 

wavelength  in  every  one  of  the  three  regions,  i.e.,  when

value of 

nU   is a small quantity and tends to zero as  (

k a

)2

n

− . (The determinants in (10) and (11) does depend 

on  γ , but not on  a   or 

1a   separately.) This is consistent with the fact that usually a small scatterer has a very 

low  intensity  scattered  field.  On  the  other  hand,  as  already  anticipated, 

nV   increases  as  (

ok a −   when  a   is 

) 2

reduced, owing to the fact that small scatterers made of conventional materials are far from supporting surface 

polaritons.  In  fact,  for  scatterers  made  of  DPS  materials  the  denominator  in  (7)  is  dominated  by 

nV   and  the 

usual approximate expression for 

nc   becomes:

where

(

)

DPS  materials  the  wave  scattering  is  weak  and  it  is  dominated  by  the  first-order  term  (corresponding  to  the 

radiation  of  an  electric  or  a  magnetic  dipole  depending  on  the  polarization  we  are  considering),  that  the  total 

scattering cross section decreases with  (

)6

0k a   and finally that the phase of the scattering coefficient is around 

/ 2π ,  which,  as  shown  later,  provides  an  equivalent  electric  dipole  radiating  in  phase  with  the  impinging 

excitation. These of course are all consistent with the conventional results expected in this case [34]. However, 

we should bear in mind that these assumptions are valid only if the determinant in 

nV   is sufficiently larger than 

nU , which is the case when small DPS scatterers are employed. If instead some combinations of DNG, SNG, 

and/or DPS metamaterials are used, either (or both) of the determinants in  (10)  and  (11)  may become zero in 

the small-radii formulation, where Eqs.  (10)  and  (11)  are applicable. The conditions for which the determinant

be:

which  again  depend  only  on  γ   and  not  on  the  outer  dimension  of  the  scatterer.  In  the  lossless  case,  these 

dispersion relations may be satisfied by some combinations of constitutive parameters, leading to the possibility 

of presence of material polaritons independent of the total size of the scatterer, but dependent on the ratio of the 

two radii. Of course we should take into account the physical limit

combination of DNG, SNG, and/or DPS metamaterials in order to fulfill one or both of the conditions given in

indicated  with  “brick”  symbols  are  the  “forbidden”  regions  for  (

(For example, the first quadrant, where both 

1ε   and 

2ε   are positive and represent conventional DPS materials, 

does  not  admit  material  polaritons  for  these  spherical  scatterers  in  the  small-radii  case.  This  confirms  that  the 

technique proposed in [11] to synthesize metamaterials with resonant tiny inclusions, that is to embed spherical 

inclusions  with  materials  with  high  permittivity  and  permeability  in  a  host  medium,  may  indeed  exhibit  a 

physical limitation for the size of the scatterers.) In the regions other than the “brick” regions, a contour plot for 

1 /a a   has  been  plotted.  Lighter  regions  correspond  to  higher  values  of 

1 /a a   (white  for 

a a = ,  black  for 
1 /

a a = ). The corresponding figure for the TE-polarized scattered wave (not shown here) may be obtained by 
1 /

substituting  ε  with  µ. 

We note that the TM and TE conditions in  (13)  depend only on the permittivities and the permeabilities of the 

materials, respectively. This is due to the fact that in the limit of small radii (i.e., electrically small scatterer) we 

 

10

are approximately dealing with a quasi “electrostatic” and a quasi “magnetostatic” problem, and the electric and 

magnetic effects are effectively disjoint. 

It  is  worth  reiterating  the  fact  that  this  resonant  phenomenon  relies  on  the  judicious  pairing  of  conjugate 

materials with oppositely signed constitutive parameters, at whose interface a local compact resonance may arise, 

similar  to  what  we  have  studied  in  the  other  setups  [4]-[9].  As  already  presented  in  [12],  this  “quasi-static” 

resonance may be viewed, at least for the first-order dipolar term, as a compact L-C resonance between the small 

positive capacitance represented by a DPS core (shell) and the small negative capacitance (which at the given 

operating frequency is effectively equivalent with a large inductance) of an ENG or DNG shell (core). Similar 

resonances  in  the  scattering  from  nanospheres  in  terms  of  the  ratio  of  radii  have  been  predicted  in  [22]  and 

experimentally shown in [23]-[27].   

From  formula  (10)  we  may  derive  another  condition  for  the  effective  “transparency”  of  the  scatterer  for  the 

particular  scattered  mode.  In  the  small-radii  approximation,  when  the  determinant  in  (10)  vanishes,  the 

scattering coefficient 

nc   becomes zero. The conditions for this situation, which again depend only on the ratio 

of the two radii, are expressed as:

Fig.  3  shows  the  permissible  and  “forbidden”  regions  for 

1ε   and 

2ε   to  achieve  the  transparency  for  the 

TM-polarized scattered wave, and the corresponding values for 

1 /a a   in the permissible region, in analogy with 

It  is  interesting  to note  that  in  this  case  it  is possible  to  achieve the  transparency  condition  also  for  DPS-DPS 

spheres,  but  one  of  the  layers  should  be  of  a  metamaterial  (or  plasmonic  material)  with 

0ε ε<

  or 

0µ µ<

, 

depending on the polarization of the scattered mode to be suppressed. We have discussed certain aspects of this 

property in a recent symposium [13], and the detailed results will be reported in the near future.

It should be mentioned here that the transparency conditions (14) are valid in the small-radii approximation, and 

one may argue that the scattering from small spheres is already small, if not zero. However, we may drastically 

reduce further the overall scattering cross section of small spheres by putting to zero the scattering coefficient for 

1n = , since according to (12) all the other higher-order scattering coefficients are usually much lower than the 

first  one.  So  if  the  dominant  scattering  coefficient  can  be  made  zero,  the  total  scattering  cross  section  of  this 

sphere  can  be  significantly  reduced.  For  larger  spheres  an  analogous  cancellation  of  any  given  multipolar 

scattering coefficient may be achieved by a suitable choice of the two materials’ parameters in order to make the 

determinant  (8)  zero. This of course reduces the total scattering cross section, but does not necessarily imply that 

the  sphere  becomes  “completely”  transparent,  since  for  large  spheres  the  overall  scattering  cross  section  may 

have non-zero contributions from several other multipolar scattering orders (see formulas  (5)  and  (6)). We have 

analyzed this problem in detail, and the results will be included in a future publication. 

An interesting point about conditions  (13)  is that they admit solution for 

a a =   and 
1 /
0

a a = , which implies 
1 /

the cases of a homogenous single-layer sphere. This means that the high scattering may be achieved also with 

such  homogeneous  spheres  composed  only  of  a  single  metamaterial,  when  the  following  conditions  for  the 

material parameters are satisfied:

(15) 

This  effect  is  the  well-known  plasmonic  resonance  for  a  homogeneous  sphere,  which  occurs  for  the  metallic 

spherical  nanoparticles  at  the  optical  or  infra-red  regimes  [34],  [37],  and  it  depends  on  the  modal  order  n.  In 

particular, one can easily derive from  (15)  the usual condition for the resonant polariton of a homogeneous small 

sphere for the dipolar ( 1

TMc

) term, which is 

02ε
ε= −

. 

Another issue to note about the “resonant” conditions (13) is that the high scattering effect may be achievable for 

any scattered mode with 

1n > . This implies that one can, in principle, select the material parameters of the two 

layers of small sphere such that the dominant term with resonant scattering would be for the quadrupolar term 

(i.e., 

n = ), the octopolar term (i.e., 

2

n = ), or any higher-order terms, instead of having it for the dipolar one 

3

(i.e., 

1n = ).  In  other  words,  for  such  a  case,  a  very  small  two-layer  metamaterial  nanosphere  may  strongly 

 

 

12

scatter as a quadrupole or an octopole, while its dipolar scattering may be much weaker. We have studied this 

issue in more detail, and have presented our preliminary results in a recent symposium [10]. The details of our 

analysis and findings will be reported elsewhere. Some experimental results and possible applications exploiting 

these second order or higher orders TM scattering resonances have been reported by other groups in [37]-[39]. 

As shown by the analysis reviewed above, when the ratio of radii is chosen to satisfy the “resonant” conditions 

(13), which implies that 

V Disp
=
n

n

= , the scattering coefficient 

0

nc   attains its maximum magnitude. However, 

as  we  deviate  from  this  “resonant”  ratio,  the  value  of 

nV   for  small  radii  becomes  much  higher  than 

nU ,  and 

hence the magnitude of coefficient 

nc   drastically decreases. This suggests a certain “ratio bandwidth”, which is 

reduced  as  the  outer  radius  a   gets  smaller  and/or  when  higher  scattering  mode  n   is  considered  (as  follows 

from the expressions  (10),  (11)). 

Fig. 4 shows the behavior of the resonant peaks of the scattering coefficient 

  for the small spherical scatterer 

TMc
1

with two concentric layers of ENG-DPS metamaterials. In particular, Fig. 4a shows the variation of 

TMc
1

  as one 

considers  different  outer  radii  a .  As  can  be  seen,  when  considering  smaller  a   the  resonant  peak  of  this 

scattering  coefficient  moves  towards  the  value  predicted  by  the  approximate  formula  (13),  and  the  “ratio 

bandwidth” becomes narrower. At the resonant peak, however, the scattering coefficient has the same value (of 

unity), independent of the total dimension of this nanosphere, and it resembles the scattering coefficient from an 

electrically large resonant sphere. This is seen in Fig. 4b, where the resonant peaks of the 

  coefficient are 

TMc
1

compared, in a logarithmic scale, for a DPS-ENG and a DPS-DPS scatterer. In other words, this nanosphere with 

two-layers of metamaterials acts as a “compact resonator”, occupying a very small volume but exhibiting large 

resonant scattering cross section. The total and the back scattering cross sections in this case are dominated by 

the resonant coefficient 

nc , and they can be written as:

It is important to point out that for the small-radii approximation (i.e., as long as the other scattering terms in  (5) 

and  (6)  are  negligible)  these  cross  sections  are  effectively  independent  of  the  outer  radius  at  the  polariton 

(16) 

13

 

 

resonance.  This  implies  that  under  condition  (13)  the  far-zone  scattered  fields  of  these  small  scatterers  are 

effectively  independent  of  the  outer  radius  of  these  spheres,  and  the  far  fields  resemble  those  of  the  large 

spheres. 

However,  the  near  field  distributions  are  different  for  different  outer  radii.  When  the  scatterer  dimensions  are 

reduced, the field intensity around the scatterer indeed becomes extremely large, as expected (since the field is 

described by 

( ).ny

  functions). This is consistent with the strong field observed around metallic nanoparticles at 

the plasmonic resonance [23]-[28], which may lead to certain applications. Again, this effect is also analogous 

with what happens in a resonant cavity. As it  may be seen from  Fig. 4, reducing the overall dimension of the 

scatterer (i.e., the outer radius) effectively leads to a higher quality (Q) factor of the equivalent resonant cavity, 

and increases the reactive fields stored in the resonant mode. 

Fig. 5 illustrates the near-zone distribution of the total electric field (Fig. 5a) and total magnetic fields (Fig. 5b) 

for the scatterer of Fig. 4a with 

a λ=

0 /100

  and 

1 /a a   satisfying the resonant condition (13) for 

1n = , under a 

plane  wave  excitation  (as  in  formula  (1)),  normalized  to  the  incident  electric  field  amplitude  and  under  the 

assumption  of  lossless  materials.  The  normalized  field  strength  shows  large  peak  values  around  the  scatterer 

(over 1000 times the amplitude of the impinging electric field), and it is dominated by the presence of the TM 

material resonant polariton (for 

1n = ), which is characterized by an electromagnetic field 90° out of phase with 

respect to the excitation, typical of any resonant phenomenon. As viewed in the far zone, the scatterer resembles 

a  strong  radiating  electric  dipole  at  the  origin,  somewhat  similar  to  what  would  happen  with  a  much  larger 

resonant  sphere  with  a  conventional  dielectric  sphere.  However,  the  large  resonant  sphere  with  DPS  materials 

would also possibly exhibit contributions from higher-order terms, whereas for the small scatterer under study 

here, at the resonant condition (13), the scattering pattern is much more dominated by the dipolar pattern.   

Clearly the material loss may sensibly affect the scattering properties of this scatterer, particularly for the smaller 

scatterers  whose  field  distribution  is  highly  concentrated  in  the  materials.  Fig.  6  shows  the  behavior  of  the 

resonant peaks when certain material loss is included in the analysis. The loss expectedly degrades and lowers 

the resonant peak, particularly for sharper resonances (for smaller  a , as was just mentioned, and/or higher  n ). 

 

14

However, with a proper choice of metamaterial layers, the scattering strength may still be sensibly higher than 

that  of  the  sphere  of  the  same  size  but with  conventional  DPS  materials,  even  when  the  losses  are  considered 

here. In the results shown in Fig. 6, the inner core is assumed to be lossless dielectric with

2

),  in  which  it  is  made  of  the  same 

lossless dielectric, and in which the entire particle is composed of silver are also shown. We can see that even 

with the realistic material loss included, the scattering is much stronger for the sphere with a pair of DPS-ENG 

layers, when compared with the DPS-DPS or ENG-ENG cases, due to the resonance phenomenon.   

Finally,  Fig.  7  shows  the  behavior  of  the  resonant  peaks  for  different  scattering  modes  n   for  the  ENG-DPS 

sphere of Fig. 4a and the DPS-ENG sphere of Fig. 4b. As expected, the “bandwidth ratio” drastically decreases 

as one considers higher scattering mode n. 

Analogous scattering effects may be expected for thin scatterers of other shapes formed by pairs of DNG, SNG, 

and/or DPS coaxial layers, as we have shown also in the cylindrical geometry [9]. A brief discussion of similar 

results for cylindrical nano-scatterers is given in Appendix B.     

POLARIZABILITIES AND EFFECTIVE PARAMETERS 

 

Owing to their interesting scattering properties, a particulate composite medium formed by embedding many of 

these  two-layered  spherical  nanoparticles  as  inclusions  may  exhibit  unusual  electromagnetic  properties.  If  we 

limit  ourselves  to  the  resonances  related  to  the  dipolar  scattering  mode 

1n =   for  these  small  particles,  the 

properties of the bulk medium can be described by its effective permittivity and permeability, which are related 

to  the  polarizability  characteristics  of  the  single  particle  and  to  the  interaction  constant  of  the  whole  lattice  of 

particles  (see  e.g.  [41]).  In  particular,  we  are  interested  in  exploring  the  effects  of  the  ratio  of  radii  (and  the 

excitation of the material polaritons) in such particles on the effective properties of the bulk medium.   

 

15

We first need to express the polarizability tensors of the single spherical particle with two-layered metamaterials.   

As  is  well  known,  such  tensors  relate  the  local  electromagnetic  fields  (

E H
,
loc

)

  to  the  induced  dipole 

moments in a particle  (

Clearly  the  elements  of  the  polarizability  tensor  α   for  the  nanoparticles  of  interest  in  the  present  study  are 

related  to  the  scattering  coefficients 

TMc

  and 

TEc
1

.  After  some  mathematical  steps,  comparing  the  scattered 

fields in  (4)  for 

1n =   with the fields radiated by equivalent electric and magnetic dipoles placed at the origin, 

these relations can be expressed as:

where the tensors  0   and  I   are the null and the identity tensors, respectively. 

These  expressions  expectedly  demonstrate  that  the  TM  scattering  coefficient  for 

1n =   is  proportional  to  the 

electric  dipole  polarizability  of  the  sphere  and  analogously  the  TE  one  is  proportional  to  its  magnetic  dipole 

polarizability. They also satisfy the physical constraint [42]-[43] for particles with no material loss, i.e.,:

In order to derive the effective constitutive parameters of a bulk medium composed of many of these identical 

particles as inclusions embedded in a host medium, we may utilize certain well-known mixing formulas [41]. If 

we assume that in the bulk medium the averaged distance between neighboring particles in any direction is small

Consistent  with  the  no-loss  assumption,

effε   is  a  real  quantity,  whereas 

effε   is  indeed  complex  due  to  the

resonant  TM  condition  (13)  for

(Mathematically  speaking,  if  we  let 

N → ,  we  will  have  only  a  few  particles,  and  thus  the  “medium” 

0

resonance will become similar to the “particle” resonance. Of course, as we make  N   very small, we no longer 

have a “medium”.) It should be noted that relations  (24)  are valid for not-extremely-dense concentrations of the 

inclusions in the host medium  [41],  which implies from  (25)  that the ratio 

  of the single particle should

not  be  very  large  at  the  resonance  of  the  bulk  medium.  This  of  course  implies  that  no  bulk  resonance  can  be 

expected  in  a  medium  composed  of  electrically  small  DPS  inclusions,  and  that  the  resonance  of  the  medium 

happens sufficiently close to the single-inclusion resonance, even though not exactly for the same ratio of radii. 

Needless to say, in order to satisfy the Kramers-Kronig conditions [29], the imaginary part of 

p

effε   has a delta 

peak  at  this  resonant  value.  Plots  of

. 

The behavior of the two plots is similar, except in the region near the resonance. The smaller  N   gets, the less

similar the two plots become. One notes that when the particle itself is at the resonance with the proper value for 

1 /a a , 

effε   becomes 

02ε−

p

, as mentioned before, and for this particular case this ratio is less than the value of 

(

1 /a a

)

ε

  for  which  the  bulk  medium  is  at  resonance.  The  effective  permittivities  shown  in  the  figure  tend  to 

values  close  to 

0ε   when 

1 /a a   is  far  away  from  the  specific 

1 /a a   chosen  for  the  particle  resonance.  This  is 

expected because these inclusions are much smaller than the wavelength, and unless they are being operated at 

its resonance, i.e., act as “compact resonators” (or at the bulk medium resonance), their polarizabilities are very 

weak.  In  particular,  we  expect  that

ε ε>

  or 

ε

02
ε< −

,  and  a  small  negative  number  in  other  cases.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the 

polarizability of a small homogenous sphere is given by:

, 

(26) 

where  ε   is  the  effective  permittivity  of  the  homogeneous  sphere  [41].  Therefore,  when  α  is  positive  this 

should slightly increase the value of 

effε   and when it is negative this should decrease it. Similar statements can 

be made about the limiting case of 

a a = , but replacing 
1 /

1

2ε   with 

1ε   in the discussion. 

We mentioned earlier that at the particle resonant ratio 

1 /a a   satisfying (13), the curve for 

effε   passes through 

p

the point 

p

effε

02
ε= −

. Furthermore, if the material parameters of the two layers in the inclusion particle are in the 

permissible region of the plot in Fig. 3 for the transparency condition and if 

1 /a a   satisfies the TM portion of 

condition (14), the effective permittivity 

p

effε   should clearly become equal to 

0ε . This is expected since for this 

ratio of radii the electric polarizability of each particle is zero (i.e., the particles are effectively transparent), and 

thus the bulk medium will be transparent as well.   

From  Eqs.  (13)  and  (14),  one  can  also  conclude  that  (

  when

19

heuristically  the  behavior  of  the  monotonic  curve  in  Fig.  8a,  in  terms  of  the  various  ranges  of 

1ε   and 

2ε ,  as 

summarized in Table 2. 

We may also examine the behavior of these plots in terms of the frequency of operation. For instance, if we take 

the outer layer of the spherical particle to be a standard dielectric material with 

ε
2

010
ε=

  and the inner core to 

be  a  lossless  plasmonic  medium  (i.e.,  an  ENG  medium)  with  the  Drude  model  for  its  permittivity  (neglecting 

losses),  i.e., 

=
ε ε

,  we  can  describe  the  effective  permittivity  in  terms  of  frequency.  Fig.  8

demonstrates such results for a given 

a a =

. 

Obviously  a  similar  analysis  may  be  performed  for  the  effective  permeability  of  the  bulk  medium,  which 

depends only on the permeabilities of the two  metamaterials  composing each nano-spherical inclusion (due to 

the quasi-static behavior of the field inside the nanosphere). The TE material polariton may be resonantly excited 

in these tiny particles and analogous relationships similar to the ones derived above may be obtained here, with 

the  usual  replacement  of  ε  with  µ  in  the  discussion.  Overall,  this  might  represent,  at  least  conceptually,  an 

interesting  new  venue  for  manufacturing  isotropic  metamaterials  with  negative  permittivities  and/or 

permeabilities. It is worth noting that by the same means we may synthesize bulk materials having low or zero 

ε  and/or  µ  (with  low  amount  of  losses),  thus  having  near-zero  refractive  index.  This  may  open  up  several 

possibilities for different applications, as shown for instance in [15]-[21]. 

SUMMARY 

Unusual scattering effects from tiny spherical particles may be obtained when concentric shells are designed by 

pairing 

together  “complementary”  double-negative 

(DNG),  single-negative 

(SNG),  and/or  standard 

double-positive  (DPS)  materials.  By  embedding  these  highly  polarizable  scatterers  in  a  host  medium  one  can 

achieve  a  bulk  medium  with  interesting  effective  parameters.  In  this  work,  we  first  reviewed  and  discussed 

various  scattering  characteristics  of  small  spherical  particles  made  of  pairs  of  DNG,  SNG,  and/or  DPS 

metamaterials,  and  provided  certain  physical  insights  into  the  mathematical  descriptions  of  these  scattering 

 

 

20

phenomena.  Since these particles  may indeed act as “compact resonators”, i.e., scatterers  with strong resonant 

scattering  cross  section  but  a  very  small  physical  volume,  they  can  be  good  candidates  for  inclusions  in 

constructing particulate composite media. The effective permittivity and permeability of such bulk media have 

been discussed here and it has been shown how they depend on various parameters of the two-layered particle 

inclusions. The effective parameters of these bulk media can thus be adjusted and tailored using several degrees 

of freedom, thus providing possibilities for constructing more complex metamaterials. Since in the optical and 

IR domains, in particular, some noble metals, e.g., silver, aluminum and gold, exhibit negative values for the real 

part of their permittivities, such metals can be used as the dielectric-coated metallic (or metal-coated dielectric) 

spherical nanoparticles for use in constructing the bulk media discussed here, which may lead to metamaterials 

with negative bulk permittivity or permeability.     

APPENDIX A: MATERIAL POLARITON 

Following the technique described in [36], one can find the material polariton for the spherical scatterer shown in 

Fig.  1.  First  we  conceptually  surround  this  scatterer  with  a  spherical  metal  wall  of  very  large  radius,  i.e., 

r R
=

(cid:0)

a

,  and  then  we  look  for  those  resonant  modes  of  this  “big  cavity”  with  a  field  distribution  mainly 

concentrated  around  the  scatterer,  which  are  described  by  the 

ny

(

)0
k r   functions  for  their  radial  dependence 

since the scatterer is small and placed at the origin. Since the determinant in  (9)  is exactly the one obtained when 

the eigensolutions for these modes are derived, 

V Disp
=
n

n

=   corresponds to the dispersion relation (for the TE 

0

or TM modes) of the material polaritons supported by this scatterer. 

It is interesting to note that in the scattering problem, when the object is illuminated by an external wave, for the 

combination of parameters for which 

nDisp   vanishes, the total field in the host medium resembles exactly the 

material  polariton  distribution  we  have  just  described  in  the  “big  cavity”,  with  a  90  degrees  phase  shift  with 

respect to the excitation. Specifically, if the n-th spherical harmonic component of the impinging field is written 

as 

ζ

nj

(

)0
k r

,  with  ζ   a 

generic 

complex 

quantity, 

the 

scattered 

field 

becomes

the  incident  field.  This  has  been  shown  clearly  in  the  field  distributions  of  Fig.  5  and  it  is  analogous  to  what 

happens in a L-C circuit when it is driven at the resonant frequency or when a surface wave mode is excited by 

an impinging evanescent wave. 

By analogy, we may relate the expression for 

nU   in  (8)  to those resonant modes of the big spherical cavity that 

are described only by 

nj k r   functions. In this case, 

nU =   represent the dispersion relations for such modes

(note how the expressions of 

nU   and 

nV   differ just for the terms 

)0
nj k a   and 

(

ny

(

k a   in  (8)  and  (9)), which 

by analogy may be called vacuum polaritons [36]. It is not a coincidence, of course, that in the big cavity these 

modes are less affected by the presence of the scatterer, since their field goes to zero at the origin, and in the 

scattering problem the scattered field disappears when 

nU =   (since the corresponding 

0

nc   is also zero). This 

might  be  an  interesting  physical  insight  into  the  anomalous  transparency  effect  we  have  discussed  in  a  recent 

symposium [13], and will be reported in more detail in a future publication. 

APPENDIX B: CYLINDRICAL CASE 

Similar to what we have shown here for the spherical geometry, also ellipsoidal or cylindrical inclusions may be 

treated in the same analytical way, and may conceptually yield similar results. In the cylindrical reference system, 

for instance, a 2-D problem (for normal incidence) similar to the one presented here may be solved, yielding to 

the excitation of resonant cylindrical polariton in nano-rods. The analytical treatment is not shown here, but it 

clearly involves cylindrical Bessel functions instead of the spherical Bessel functions used here. The formulas 

analogous to  (13)  in this case are given as [9]:

Also in this case we may predict anomalous effects for a bulk medium consisting of collections of these resonant

nano-rods and the results would predictably be analogous to the ones presented here.

FIGURE CAPTIONS 

Figure  1  –  Cross  section  of  a  spherical  nano-particle  (as  inclusion)  composed  of  two  concentric  layers  of 

different isotropic materials in a suitable spherical reference system  ( ,

r θ ϕ .

)

Figure 2 – Regions for which the dispersion relation  (13)  for the TM-polarized scattered wave is satisfied, with 

the corresponding values for 

1 /a a   between zero and unity. The “forbidden” regions indicted with the “brick” 

symbols present values of 

1ε   and 

2ε   for which the condition (13) for the TM case cannot be fulfilled. 

Figure 3 – Regions for which the transparency condition  (14)  for the TM-polarized scattered wave is fulfilled, 

with the corresponding values for 

1 /a a   between zero and unity. Analogous to Fig. 2, the “forbidden” regions 

indicated with the “brick” symbols correspond to values of 

1ε   and 

2ε   for which the condition (14) for the TM 

case has no physical meaning.

Abstract

We evaluated the efficiency of various models in describing the time decay of aftershock rate of 47

simple sequences occurred in California (37) from  1933  to  2004  and  in  Italy  (10)  from  1976  to

2004.  We  compared  the  models  by  the  corrected  Akaike  Information  Criterion  (AICc)  and  the

Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), both based on the log-likelihood function but also including

a  penalty  term  that  takes  into  account  the  number  of  independent  observations  and  of  free

parameters  of  each  model.  These  criteria  follow  two  different  approaches  (probabilistic  and

Bayesian respectively) well covering the wide spectra of current views on model comparison. To

evaluate the role of catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main shock, we compared the

performance  of  different  models  by  varying  the  starting  time  Ts  and  the  minimum  magnitude

threshold Mmin  for  each  sequence.    We found that Omori-type models including parameter c  are

preferable  to  those  not  including  it,  only  for  short  Ts  and  low  M min  while  the  latters  generally

perform better than the formers for Ts longer than a few hours and Mmin larger than the main shock

magnitude Mm minus 3 units. For Ts>1 day or Mmin>Mm-2.5, only about 15% of the sequences still

give a preference to models including c. This clearly indicates that a value of parameter c different

from zero does not represent a general property of aftershock sequences in California and Italy but

it is very likely induced in most cases by catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main

shock.  We  also  considered  other  models  of  aftershock  decay  proposed  in  the  literature:  the

Stretched Exponential Law in two forms (including and not including a time shift) and the band

Limited Power Law (LPL). We found that such models perform worse than the Modified Omori

Model (MOM) and other Omori-type models for the large majority of sequences, although for LPL,

the relatively short duration of the analyzed sequences (one year) might also contribute to its poor

performance. Our analysis demonstrates that the  the  MOM  with  c kept  fixed  to  0  represent  the

better choice for the modeling (and the forecasting) of simple sequence behavior in California and

Italy.

Introduction

As  well  known  since  the  pioneer  work  by  Omori  (1894),  the  aftershock  rate  is  roughly

proportional to the inverse of the time t elapsed after the main shock.

where  K  is  a  constant  that  depends  on  the  total  number  of  aftershocks  in  the  sequence  and c a

temporal shift. A modification of such law have been later proposed by Utsu (1961) which called it

Modified Omori Model (MOM)

where p and c are free parameters that can be estimated from the data, maximizing the likelihood

function of the process (Ogata, 1983). Such power-law behavior is indicative of a physical process

generally slower than those typically observed in nature, which are usually described by negative

exponentials  (Utsu  et  al.,  1995).  Although  a  complete  theory  of  aftershock  generation  is  not

available,  some  simple  theoretical  hypotheses  allow  in  many  cases  to  deduce  laws  of  this  kind

(Dieterich,  1986;  Yamashita  and  Knopoff,  1987).  A  number  of  successive  studies  carried  on  in

various  part  of  the  world  have  shown  how  the  MOM  satisfactorily  describes  the  time  decay  of

aftershock  rate  for  most  sequences  excepting  those  for  which  the  production  of  secondary

aftershocks  is  particularly  significant.   In  such  cases,  the  use  of stochastic branching  processes

(Hawkes  and  Adamopulos,  1973;  Hawkes  and  Oakes,  1974;  Kagan  and  Knopoff,  1987;  Ogata,

1988) is more appropriate. However in the present paper we restrict our interest to models that can

be easily used for the expeditious forecasting of simple sequences not including strong secondary

clustering as done for example by Reasenberg and Jones (1989) for California, Eberhart-Phillips

(1998) for New Zealand and Lolli and Gasperini (2003) for Italy.

The role of the two free parameters of the MOM is rather different: while p has been introduced

by Utsu (1961) to model sequence behaviors significantly deviating from an hyperbolic decay, the

inclusion of c was essentially an algebraic expediency to avoid that the rate tends to the infinity for t

approaching zero (Gross and Kisslinger, 1994; Narteau et al., 2002). On the other hand, Kagan and

Knopoff (1981) justify this divergence at t=0 by considering the main shock as the superposition of

an infinite number of shocks occurring in an infinitesimal time interval. Nyffenegger and Frohlich

(2000) report that limiting the data to an adequate time interval, the Omori model with fixed c=0

would adequately describe sequence behavior.

Notwithstanding these doubts on its physical meaning, parameter c is usually assumed different

from 0 by most, due to the convenience of eliminating the divergence at t=0. However, its inclusion

3

in the rate formulation has also the effect to smooth the decay of the modeled rate with time in the

first times after the main shock, particularly for t<c. In this time interval the main shock coda and

the superposition of many aftershocks often prevent the reliable detection of seismic-phase arrival-

times and the measure of phase amplitudes by seismic observatories thus making the location and

sizing of all aftershocks quite problematic in the practice. Thus the Maximum Likelihood Estimate

(MLE) of c deduced from the data of real sequences might reflect more the incompleteness of the

earthquake catalog than the true behavior of the aftershock time-decay (Utsu et al., 1995; Narteau et

al.,  2002).  Vidale  et  al.  (2003;  2004)  and  Peng  and  Vidale  (2004)  note  that  the  number  of

aftershocks  in  the  first  few  minutes  of  an  aftershock  sequence,  observed  on  high-pass  filtered

seismograms, is several times higher than the aftershock numbers recorded even in local catalogs.

Moreover,  as  also  discussed  by  Gasperini  and  Lolli  (2005),  the  two  parameters  are  strictly

correlated and thus the MLE of parameter c might significantly influence the estimate of p. This

correlation might also result in biased estimates of average parameters to be used as a-priori values

for the forecasting of future sequences.

The  interplay  between  p  and  c  can  be  described  by  considering  the  following  log-log

transformation for the time dependent part of eq. (2)

describes the slope of the of the MOM log-log curve as a function of time (Fig. 1). We can consider

peff =-y’(t) as the apparent (“effective”) power law exponent of the MOM at time t. peff is 0 at t=0, it

is 1/2p at t=c and tends asymptotically to p as t tends to the ∞. As well peff is constant and coincides

(cid:0) 

with p, if c=0 (t≠0). In general a high value of c (maybe due to data incompleteness) induces a

decrease of peff for a relatively long time after the main shock that can be counterbalanced by a

corresponding increase of p. The effect is instead almost negligible for low c values. The result of

this interplay is that p and c are positively and almost linearly correlated, as Gasperini and Lolli

(2005) evidenced through a statistical analysis of independent parameter estimates of sequences

from Italy (Lolli and Gasperini, 2003) and New Zealand (Eberhart-Phillips, 1998). Gasperini and

Lolli (2005) also showed how in some cases the MLEs of p and c are only barely constrained by the

data, along an almost straight trajectory of the parameter space.

Other functional forms have been proposed in the past to describe the decay of aftershock rate

with  time.  On  the  basis  of  physical  considerations,  originally  made  by Shlesinger and Montroll

4

(1984),  for  a  physical  problem  -the  dielectric  relaxation-  that  presents  many  analogies  with

aftershock decay, Kisslinger (1993) proposed the stretched exponential law (STREXP)

properties  of  the  area.  For  q=1  the  model  becomes  the  classical  exponential  decay  (Debye

relaxation) which has also been suggested as a model for aftershock decay (Mogi, 1962) while for

q=0 it corresponds to the simple Omori’s model.

The STREXP model has been modified by Gross and Kisslinger (1994) to include, analogously to

the MOM, a time shift d

Gross and Kisslinger (1994) showed that, the STREXP and its modification might fit the data of

some Californian sequences better than the MOM.

More recently, Narteau et al (2002, 2003) proposed a “band limited” power law (LPL) restricted

to  the  interval  between  two  characteristic  rates,  above  and  below  which  the  decay  with  time  is

respectively linear and exponential

is  the  incomplete  Gamma  function,  and  A, q , λa  and λb  are  free  parameters  of  the  model.  In

particular A has a role similar to parameter K of the Omori’s model and is chosen so that the time

integral  of  the  rate  from  the  beginning  to  the  end  of  the  sequence  equates  the  total  number  of

shocks; q is the exponent of the power law decay (similar to parameter p of Omori’s models) while

λb >> λa are the values of the rate at which the mode of decay changes from linear to power-law and

from power-law to exponential respectively. Assuming a given threshold (i.e. 0.8, 0.9, 0.99) for the

rate divergence ζ between LPL and a pure power-law, Narteau et al. (2002, 2003) determine two

transition  times

ζ  separating  the  three  stages  of  the  process.  This  model  has  two  very

interesting properties:  the rate integral is convergent even if q<1 and the rate is finite at t=0.

In  this  work  we  will  analyze a  set  of  aftershock sequences  occurred in  Italy and  California to

investigate on the real significance of parameter c in the MOM and particularly on the effects of

where

catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main shock on c estimates. To do that, we will

compare the performance of Omori-type models including parameter c and not including it. We will

also consider in the comparison the alternative decay models (eq. 5, 6 and 7) described above.

Catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main shock might be due to several factors (see

Kagan, 2004, for a comprehensive discussion) ranging from the overlapping of seismic records that

makes difficult the identification and location of many shocks, to the changes in the seismographic

network (some stations might be damaged by the main shock). Moreover, as the number of shocks

to be located and sized might be several order of magnitude larger than in quiet periods, the seismic

network  personnel  might be  unable  to  sustain  the  workload  and  thus  the  network  management

might take the administrative decision to increase the magnitude threshold above the standard one.

In all these cases catalog incompleteness should be a decreasing function of time after the main

shocks (as the risk of superposition and neglect decreases with the decreasing rate of aftershocks) as

well  as  of  the  minimum  magnitude  threshold  (as  stronger  aftershocks  are  more  likely  to  be

recognized and analyzed well by network operators).   We will thus estimate the parameters and

compare the goodness of fit of various models by varying the starting time of the modeled portion

of the sequences and the minimum magnitude of aftershocks considered for the modeling. In any

case we will restrict our analysis to the time interval following the first detected aftershock above

minimum magnitude thus we will be unable to make inferences on the behavior of the process at

times comparable with rupture time of the main shock where the point model has to somehow break

down.

Catalog data and sequence detection

For California we simply used the revised catalog from 1932 to 2004 available from the Southern

California Earthquake Center (SCEC) site (http://www.scecdc.scec.org/). For Italy, we had instead

to merge several catalogs of Italian instrumental earthquakes covering the time interval from 1960

to 2004. From 1981 to 1996, the data come from the Catalogo strumentale dei terremoti Italiani dal

1981 a 1996 Version 1.1 (CSTI Working Group, 2001; 2004), which is based on an integration of

the  seismic  phase  data  of  the  Rete  Sismica  Nazionale  Centralizzata  (RSNC)  of  the  Istituto

Nazionale  di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) and of some regional networks  operating  on  the

Italian  territory.  In  CSTI,  all  earthquakes  have  been  relocated  with  uniform  methods  and  the

magnitudes revalued from original amplitudes and coda-durations, according to Gasperini (2002),

by the calibration with real and synthetic Wood-Anderson magnitudes. From 1997 to 2002 we used

6

the Catalogo della Sismicità Italiana 1.0 (Castello et al, 2005) which also is based on the relocation

of an integrated dataset of RSNC and regional networks with revised magnitudes. For the period

from  1960  to  1980,  we  used  the  catalog  of  the  Progetto Finalizzato  Geodinamica (Postpischl,

1985).  For  this  dataset,  we  corrected,  according  to  Lolli  and  Gasperini  (2003),  the  original

instrumental magnitudes on the basis of an empirical comparison of the observed rates with respect

to the CSTI recalibrated catalog from1981 to 1996.  Finally from 2003 to 2004 data are taken from

To  build  the  sequences,  we  only  considered  the  shocks  shallower  than  40  km. We  define  the

space-time influence zone of any shock as a spatial circular area centered in the epicenter and a time

window starting at the shock origin time. We consider as main shocks (originating sequences) all

earthquakes with magnitude not lower than 5.0 and not included in the influence zone of a larger

shock.  The time  window is fixed to one year for all main shocks while the radius  R varies as a

function of magnitude  as  Log10(R)=0.1238M+0.983 (corresponding to  Table  1  of   Gardner and

Knopoff, 1974). Considering the need to analyze subsets of the data with varying starting times and

minimum magnitudes we have selected only the sequences (listed in Table 1) including at least 100

shocks  with  magnitude  not  lower  than  main  shock  magnitude  Mm  minus  3.5  (93  for  the  large
Southern Italy earthquake of November 23rd 1980). Moreover, since all the decay models described

above are not suitable to model complex sequences with evident secondary clustering due to strong

aftershocks,  we  excluded  from computations all sequences (marked  with  an  asterisk  in  Table  1)

including at least an aftershock with magnitude larger than main shock magnitude minus 0.6 (one

half  of  the  average  magnitude  difference  between the  main  shocks  and  the largest aftershocks,

according to Bath (1965) law). In this way we selected in all 37 sequences (over 61 detected) for

California and 10 sequences (over 15 detected) for Italy. The corresponding files in CIT format are

also available from authors’ anonymous ftp site.

Model fitting and comparison

We used the maximum likelihood procedure (Ogata, 1983) to estimate the best fitting parameters

for  the  different  models  of  aftershock  decay  rate.  This  approach  consists  of  approximating  the

difference between the N aftershocks occurring at times ti, (i=1,N), during the time interval [Ts, Te]

(11)

and an intensity function λ(t) defined from a non-stationary Poisson process (Narteau et al., 2002).

The log-likelihood function of such a process for a parameter set 

θ is given by (Ogata, 1983)

The  parameter  set 

ˆ θ   which  maximize  eq.  (9)  for  the aftershock times ti  is  the  MLE  of  model
parameters for the given sequence. We maximized Equation (9) in two steps: we first explored a

regular  grid  of  parameter  values  covering  reasonable  ranges  of  variation  for  each  of  them.

Successively the approximate maximum was refined using the Fortran routine BCONG/DBCONG

of the IMSL Math library (Visual Numerics, 1997). This code uses a quasi-Newton method (Dennis

and  Schnabel,  1983)  and  an  active  set  strategy  (Gil  and  Murray,  1976)  to  solve  optimization

problems subject to simple bounds.

For each sequence, we considered the rate equations for the original Omori model (eq. 1) and the

MOM (eq. 2) as well as for two further models obtained from the previous ones by removing c

The MLE for the four models are computed for increasing starting times Ts with logarithmic steps

going from 0.001 to 1.79 days and varying the minimum magnitude Mmin with linear steps of 0.1

magnitude units from main shock magnitude Mm minus 3.5 and Mm-2.5.

The comparison among different empirical models must take into account not only the goodness

of fit with data but also the number of free parameters of each model. In fact, as the data are noisy,

there is the possibility that complex models might overfit random features of data not representing

true physical properties of the investigated process. Thus the “best model” is not necessarily the one

showing the absolute maximum likelihood with data but a simpler model could be preferable if the

contribution of some of its parameters to the likelihood improvement is negligible. This concept is

well  described  by  the  General  Information  Criterion  (GIC)  (Leonard  and  Hsu,  1999)  where  a

“penalty” term for each parameter is subtracted from the maximized log-likelihood function

 

GIC = ln l ˆ θ ( ) −

number of free parameters, among a set of alternatives: the better the model the larger the GIC. The

choice  of  the  penalty  is  not  univocal  in  the  literature.  In  the  initial  proposition  of  the  method,

Akaike (1974) deduced, that at the first order, α=2 is the correct asymptotic bias correction term

which minimize the Kullback-Leibler information or distance (Burnham and Anderson, 1998). This

choice (apart for a multiplicative factor -2) leads to the well-known Akaike information criterion

(AIC) already used by several authors (i.e. Ogata, 1983; Gross and Kisslinger, 1994; Narteau et al.,

2003) to compare the performance of aftershock decay models

AIC = max L ˆ θ ( ) − k                                                      (13)

Sugiura  (1978)  showed  that  AIC  might  perform  poorly  if  there  are  too  many  parameters  in

relation to the size of the sample. He derived a second-order variant of AIC that he called c-AIC.

(cid:0) 

Hurvich and Tsai (1989) further studied this small-sample bias adjustment, which led to a criterion,

assuming α=2n/(n-k-1), that is called AICc

AICc = max L ˆ θ ( ) − k −

)
(
k k + 1
n − k − 1

= AIC −

)
(
k k + 1
n − k − 1

(14)

where n is the number of data in the sample. The use of AICc is always preferable with respect to

AIC if the ratio between the number of data and the number of parameters n/k (as in most of our

sequences) is lower than 40 (Burnham and Anderson, 1998).

(cid:0) 

Under slightly different assumptions, Schwarz (1978) showed instead, that the choice α=lnn is

asymptotically optimal since, for n→∞, the probability that the best model have the higher BIC tend

to the unity. Furthermore Draper (1995) noted that the addition of a term –ln(2π),  neglected  by

Schwarz (1978), may improve the accuracy. The estimators resulting from both these choices are

usually  referred  in  the  literature  as  Bayesian  Information  Criterion  (BIC)  (i.e.  Burnham  and

Anderson, 1998; Leonard and Hsu, 1999; Main et al., 1999). For sake of clarity we will indicate

them as Schwarz information criterion (SIC) and BIC respectively

SIC = max L ˆ θ ( ) −

(cid:0) 

The  four  estimators  (AIC,  AICc,  SIC  and  BIC)  work  similarly  in  many  cases  but  might  give

slightly different results, depending on the sample size and on the number of free parameters. In

general AIC and AICc tend to prefer simpler models than SIC and BIC for smaller sample sizes, and

more complex models for larger samples. In particular AIC is equivalent to SIC for n≈7 while BIC

9

stays about in the middle among the two, as it is equivalent to AIC for n≈46.  For k ranging from 1

to 5, AICc is equivalent to SIC for n ranging between 11 and 19 and to BIC for n between 50 and

58.

For simplicity, we will consider, in the following only AICc and BIC as they adequately represent

the  two  alternative  approaches  (probabilistic  and  Bayesian)  to  information  theory  in  model

evaluation. We will use both of them to assess, for each sequence, the best among the four Omori-

type  models  (eq.  1,  2,  10  and  11)  as  well  as  among  such  best  model  and  the  alternative  ones:

STREXPs and LPL (eq. 5, 6 and 7). For sake of a comparison with previous papers (Gross and

Kisslinger, 1994; Narteau et al., 2003) we will also compare the performance of the STREXPs and

the LPL with the MOM (eq. 2). The numbers of free parameter (k) to be counted by AICc (eq. 14)

and BIC (eq. 16) are 1 for the model of eq.  (10), 2 for the original Omori model (1) and the model

of eq. (11), 3 for the MOM (eq. 2) and the STREXP (eq. 5), 4 for the modified STREXP (eq. 6) and

the LPL (eq. 7).

Results and Discussion

In  Table  1  we  report  the  MLE  of  MOM  parameters,  for  the  selected  Californian  and  Italian

sequences, assuming as Ts the time of the first aftershock above the minimum magnitude threshold

Mmin=Mm-3.5.  Parameter  standard  deviations  are  computed  from  the  diagonal  elements  of  the

inverse of the Fisher information matrix (see  i.e. Guo  and Ogata, 1997). We can note how for 14

Californian and 2 Italian sequences respectively, the best c estimate (maximizing the likelihood) is

exactly 0 (the standard deviations are not computed as such value is at the edge of the definition

interval). This indicates that for these sequences, eq. (11) is preferable with respect to MOM (eq. 2)

independently on the incompleteness of the catalog in the first times after the main shock.

In the following we will count the number of times each model is found to be the best among the

alternatives, on the basis of AICc and BIC criteria, and we will plot the behavior of these counts as

a function of starting time Ts and minimum magnitude Mmin. In Fig. 2, the comparison concerns the

four  Omori-type  models  (eq.  1,  2,  10,  11)  as  a  function  of  the  starting  time  Ts  for sequences of

California and Mmin=Mm-3.5. For Ts<0.01 days (about 15 minutes) the models including c (eq. 1 and

2) prevails for the most of the analyzed sequences. Particularly the MOM (green) and the model

with p free and c fixed to 0 (black) are almost in balance but among the models with fixed p=1, the

one with c free (red) clearly prevails with respect  to the one with c=0 (blue). Starting from about

0.01 days after the main shock, we can note a clear decrease of choices in favor of models including

c and a corresponding increase of the preferences for models without c (eq. 10 and 11). After 1 day

10

the counts become 34 versus 3 in favors of the latter ones. Even the simple hyperbolic law (blue)

appears to be preferable with respect to both models with c free. A similar behavior is shown in Fig.

3 for Italy. For this dataset the preferences for models with c free are more than those for models

with c fixed to 0, up to Ts≈0.1-0.3 days (2.5-7 hours) after the main shock. After 1 day the balance

becomes about 8 to 2 in favor of models without c and at the maximum Ts=1.79 days the mostly

preferred model is the simple hyperbolic one in 4 cases over 10. For both datasets, AICc and BIC

show similar behaviors with maximum differences of 5 counts for California and 2 for Italy. Thus

for sake of brevity we will show only BIC in the following figures.

Figure  4  shows  the  results  for  both  datasets  put  together.  The  scores  after  1  day  indicate  the

preference  of  models  without  c for 42 sequences versus 5. In all cases shown the counts for the

MOM  (the  most  complicate  model)  tend  almost  to  0  for  long  starting  times.  Note  that,  for  all

sequences and thresholds, the MOM, which comprises within it the other simpler models, reaches

anyhow the maximum log-likelihood among all models (including some ties with model of eq. 11

when the estimated c is exactly 0). The better performance of the simpler models is, in fact, due to

the penalty term assigned by AICc and BIC to the additional parameters of the MOM.

These results seem to indicate that in most cases a value of c different from 0 is strongly related

to the incompleteness in the first hours after the main shock. Particularly, the Italian catalog appears

to be slightly more affected by incompleteness with respect to the Californian one.

In Figure 5 the best Omori-type model (a) and the MOM (b) are compared (using BIC criterion)

with other alternative models (eq. 5, 6 and 7). In this case the preference for the former ones is clear

and only slightly dependent on starting time Ts. In fact, although in several cases the log-likelihood

of alternative models (and particularly of LPL) is higher than the one of the best Omori-type model

or of the MOM, the improvement of the fit does not justify the increase of free parameters. We must

note however that the low performance (in terms of AICc) of LPL can be justified by the method we

have adopted to select sequences. In fact, such model might be preferable with respect to the MOM

when  the  observing  time  interval  is  long  enough  to  include  the  transition  from  power-law  to

exponential  decay  and  this  might  not  be  the  case  due  to  the  limit  of  one  year  we  imposed  to

sequence duration. On the other hand our analysis seems to indicate, in agreement with previous

findings, that both the STREXP models are only rarely preferable to MOM.

In  Fig.  6,  for  the  joint  set  of  Californian  and  Italian  sequences,  we  focus  on  the  comparison

between the two Omori type models having both p free to vary and c free (the MOM, eq. 2, solid

curve) and fixed to 0 (eq. 11, dotted) respectively. The crossover starting time is about at 0.006 days

(8 minutes) and, for Ts larger than a few hours after the main shock the scores became about 8 times

to 1 in favor of the model without c.

11

To better investigate on the nature of this preference for the model with c fixed to 0 we performed

additional comparisons varying the minimum magnitude Mmin threshold from Mm-3.5 to Mm-2.5. In

Fig.  7  and  8  we  show  the  results  of  this  comparison  for  sequences  from  California  and  Italy

respectively, by assuming as Ts the time of the first aftershock. For both datasets the preferences are

almost  in  balance  at  the  lower  threshold  Mm-3.5  with  a  slight  prevalence  of  the  MOM,  but  the

model with fixed c=0 starts to progressively increase its counts for increasing thresholds and clearly

performs better than the MOM with c free for Mmin>Mm-3. For the California dataset we have the

crossover at Mm-3.4 and a clear divergence of the two curves starting from Mm-3.0  while for Italy,

after the initial prevalence of the MOM, there is a tie up to Mm-3.0 and a clear divergence starting

from  M min=Mm-2.7.  Apart  from  small  differences  among  the  two  datasets  (the  Italian  catalog

appears again less complete than the Californian one) these computations clearly confirms that for

the great majority of the sequences the incompleteness of the catalog in the first times after main

shock is likely to be the cause of c values different from 0.

In order to show the effect of time and magnitude thresholds on the parameters of decay models,

we reported, for all the analyzed sequences, the plot of the behavior of p parameter for eq. (2) and

(11) as well of c for eq. (2) as a function of starting time Ts and of the difference between minimum

and main shock magnitudes Mmin-Mm in figure 9 and 10 respectively. Both in Fig. 9a and 9b we can

observe a general increase of the scatter of parameter p among different sequences for increasing

starting time although the p values as well as the scatter are generally lower for model of eq. (2)

(Fig. 9a) with respect to the MOM (Fig. 9b). This difference is a clear empirical confirmation of the

effect  of  the  correlation  between  the  two  parameters  of  the  MOM  described  above:  a  c  value

different from 0 implies a larger  MLE  of  p.   As  well, the interplay between the two parameters

increases the dispersion of p estimates.  In both plots the thick dashed lines show the behaviors of

the arithmetic average of p  values as a function of starting time. In both cases the averages appear

rather stable but, for model of eq. (2),  we can see a initial increase from 0.74 at short Ts to about

0.76  for Ts=0.1 days followed by a decrease down to 0.71 for the maximum starting time of 1.8

days while for the MOM the trend is almost monotonic and ranges from about 0.82 at Ts=0.001

days to 0.89 at Ts=1.8 days. On the other hand the c values show in many cases (when they are

different from 0) an almost constant behavior, then a drop to low values (or to 0) which sometimes

is followed by an oscillation, indicating an instability of such parameter for large starting times after

main  shock.  In  this  case  the  thick  dashed  line  indicates  the  geometric  average  of  non-null  c

estimates at every Ts. Considering the direct correlation between the two parameters of the MOM,

the increasing trend of the c average might explain the absence, for the MOM, of the decrease of the

p average observed for model of eq. (2).

12

In  fig.  10a  we  can  note  for  model  of  eq.  (2)  a  general  increasing  trend  of  p  for  increasing

minimum  magnitude  while  for  the  MOM  (Fig.  10b)  the  same  increasing  behavior  is  somehow

masked,  for  some  sequences,  by  the  interplay  with  parameter  c  (Fig.  10c)  that  is  generally

decreasing with a drop to very low (or null) c values starting from different thresholds depending on

the sequence. For the MOM the increase of the minimum magnitudes appears to slightly reduce the

scatter of parameter estimates among different sequences. The average values show  for  eq. (2) a

significant increase of p from 0.74 to 0.82 when going from Mmin= Mm-3.5 to Mmin= Mm-2.5 and a

smaller increase (from 0.82 to 0.84) for the MOM, while the geometric average of non-null c values
decrease from about 4x10-2 to 5x10-3.  

Conclusions

Our analysis showed that parameter c of the Modified Omori Model (MOM) is not necessary to

fit at best most of the 47 simple aftershock sequences we have studied, occurred in California and

Italy from the beginning of the instrumental era to 2004. Although a minority of sequences (about

10-15%) actually requires the presence of c, we can confidently assert that such parameter does not

represent  a  general  feature  of  the  aftershock  rate  decay  but  it  is  mainly  an  artifice  induced  by

catalog incompleteness in the first times after the main shock. Both models not including c (eq. 10

and 11) have shown to be preferable with respect to the corresponding models including c (eq. 1

and  2),  if  the  first  hours  after  the  main  shock,  when  the  catalog  is  likely  to  be  incomplete,  are

excluded by the analysis. It is interesting to note how the very primitive hyperbolic model (with

p=1 and c=0) might actually well represent the behavior of many sequences as it is found to be

preferable among all others for more that about 1/3 of the Italian sequences (1/5 in California) if the

modeling interval starts about 7-8 hours after the main shock.

On the other hand, if the first hours after the main shock are excluded from the analysis and/or the

minimum  magnitude  threshold  of  shocks  included  in  modeling  is  taken  larger  than  main  shock

magnitude  minus  3  units,  the  rate  decay  model  of  eq.  (11)  with  variable  p and c fixed  to  0  is

preferable  in  about  40  cases  over  47  with  respect  to  the  MOM.   In  our  opinion,  such  model

represents  the  best  choice  for  modeling  the  behavior  of  simple  sequences  even  because  its  use

avoids the danger of a biased estimate of parameter p  due to the interplay with parameter c (see

Gasperini and Lolli, 2005). Even the problem of the divergence at t=0 is not effective in the practice

as the most reliable estimates are made using Ts≠0. Another possible alternative for the modeling of

sequence behavior could be the adoption of a procedure derived from the one we have followed in

our analysis that is i) excluding from computation the first 6-10 hours after the main shock and/or

13

the shocks with magnitude lower than Mm-3 and ii) choosing, for each sequence, the model that

perform better, on the basis of AICc or BIC. With both alternatives the reliability of the estimated

parameters as well as the forecasting ability of the a-priori average model should improve due to the

reduction of the danger of overfitting and of the interplay between the two parameters of the MOM.

The behavior of p values with varying starting times and minimum magnitude appears quite stable

(the average over all sequences varies from about 0.82 to 0.89 for the MOM and from 0.74 to 0.79

for the model of  eq. (2)) although the scatter among different sequences increases for increasing

starting  time  and  slightly  decreases  for  increasing  minimum  magnitude.  For  the  MOM,  the

comparison with the behavior of c (which is increasing for increasing starting time and decreasing

for increasing minimum magnitude) confirms the existence of a strict correlation between the two

parameters that, at least in some cases, might be the cause of a biased estimate of p.

We  also  verified  that  the  Stretched  Exponential  model  (Gross  and Kisslinger,  1994)  does  not

represent a valid alternative to the Omori-type models as its performance is definitely poorer. On

the contrary the same conclusion cannot be drawn, for the band Limited Power Law (LPL) model

(Narteau et al., 2003), as the chosen length of the time interval (1 year) could not include the time

when the transition from the power-law to the negative exponential actually occurs. We believe that

further efforts making use of the LPL could confirm the effectiveness of such model, particularly in

the  long  times  portion  of  the  sequences.  Our  results  regarding  the  short  times,  showing  that  the

deviation from the power-law is likely to be due to catalog incompleteness in most cases, would

suggest a modification of LPL where the short time transition from linear decay to power-law is

removed and only the long time transition from power-law to exponential is considered.   This can

be  easily  implemented  by  substituting  the  first incomplete Gamma  function  in  eq.  (7)  with  the

complete one Γ(q):

λ t( ) =

[
A Γ q( ) −γ q,λbt
t q

(

)

(cid:0) 

This modified model will be the subject of a future paper currently in preparation.

Figure 1 – Effects on aftershock rate decay of parameter c of the modified Omori model (MOM).

Panel a): aftershock rate as a function of time after the main shock for the MOM with p=1.2 and c

varying between 0 and 10 days. Panel b): behavior of effective p (see text) as a function of time

after the main shock for the same models (for c=0, effective p coincide with p at any time).

Figure 2 – Comparison among Omori-type models (eq. 1, blue, eq. 2, green, eq. 10 black, eq. 11,

red)  for  Californian  sequences.  The  numbers  of  sequences  for  which  each  model  is  the  best  are

plotted as a function of the starting time Ts. In panel a) the comparison is based in AICc while in

panel b) on BIC.

Figure 3 – Comparison among Omori-type models as in Figure 1 but for Italian sequences.

Figure 4 – Comparison among Omori-type models as in Figure 1 but for the joint set of Californian

and Italian sequences.

Figure 5 –Comparison, using BIC, of alternative models with Omori-type ones for the joint set of

Californian and Italian sequences. STREXP with time shift (black) and without it (red) and LPL

(green) are compared with the best Omori-type model (blue), in panel a), and with the MOM (blue),

in panel b).

Figure 6 –Comparison between the MOM (solid) and the model of eq. (2) with c fixed to 0 (dotted),

as a function of starting time Ts, for the joint set of Californian and Italian sequences.

Figure 7 –Comparison between MOM (solid) and the model of eq. (2) with c fixed to 0 (dotted), as

a  function  of  the  difference  between  minimum  magnitude  of  aftershocks  and  main  shock

magnitude, for Californian sequences.

Figure 8 –Comparison, as in Figure 7, between MOM (solid) and the model of eq. (2) with c fixed

to 0 (dotted) but for Italian sequences.

Figure 9 – Behavior of aftershock decay model parameters as a function of starting time Ts for all 47

analyzed sequences. In panel a) the parameter p of eq. (2), in panels b) and c) the parameters of the

MOM (eq. 11) p and c respectively. In panels a) and b) the thick dashed lines indicate the arithmetic

average among all sequences of parameter p, while in panel c) the geometric average of non-null c

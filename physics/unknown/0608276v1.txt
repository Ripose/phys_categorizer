Abstract

The  notion  of  gravitational  emission  as  an  emission  of  the  same  level  with

electromagnetic emission is based on the proven fact of existence of electron’s stationary states
in its own gravitational field,  characterized  by gravitational constant   K=1042G  (G  – Newton’s

gravitational constant). The transition to stationary states is to cause gravitational emission of an

electron  that  is  characterized  exactly  by  constant  K.  To  the  development  of  these  results  this

paper reviews the algorithm of this sort of emission’s spectrum identification in the experiments

with electron beams.

constant.  The  equations  with  the  defined  constants  are  the  equations  of  the Einsteinian
general relativity  theory (GRT).  The  equations  (1)  are  common  mathematical  form  of
gravitational field equations, corresponding to the equivalency principle and general covariance
axiom. The equations in form (1) were acquired simultaneously with Einstein but independently
from  him  by  Hilbert  [1].  In  [2,  3,  4]  there  was  made  a  simple  and  at  the  same  time  strict
assumption of the existence of such numeric values of gravitational constant (cid:580) and constant L
in quantum sphere, that bring to stationary states in own gravitational field, and these are already
emitters of gravitational field with Newtonian gravitational constant. The very numeric values of
(cid:580) and L
 are estimated independently, exactly within this approach. Herewith we make reference
to (cid:570). Salam [5], as he was one of the first to pay attention to Newtonian gravitational constant’s
numeric  value  does  not  conform to  quantum  level.  He  was  the  one  to  propose  the  concept  of
“strong”  gravity,  that  was  based  on  the  assumption  of  f-mesons  spin  2  existence,  that  form
SU(3)-  multiplet  (described  by  Paul-Firz).  It  was  proven  that  a  possibility  of  a  different  link
constant along with Newtonian one does not contradict the observed effects [5]. Due to a number
reasons  these  approach  was  not  developed  further.  As  it  is  clear  now,  this  numeric  value  of
“strong”  gravity  constant  is  to  be  used  in  equations  (1)  with
.  Besides,  precisely  with
 stationary solutions of general Einsteinian equations can be found, which was noticed by
 by (cid:570). Friedman [6], the
-

Einstein himself, but after discovery of functionary solutions with
modern  shape  of  the  GRT  was  finally  formed.  The  decisive  argument  of  GRT  to  equal
element to zero is the necessity of right limit passage to Newtonian gravitation theory.

In  the  simplest  (from  the  point  of  view  of  the  original  mathematical  estimations)
)  is

approach  the  problem  on  steady  state  in  own  gravitational  field  (with  constants  (cid:580) and L
solved in [3, 4]. From the solution of this problem it becomes evident:

  =4.4· 1029  m-2  there  is  a  spectrum  of
a)  With  numeric  values  of K »
electron’s  stationary  states  in proper  gravitational  field  (0.511  MeV  …0.681  MeV).  The  main
state is detected electron’s rest energy 0.511 MeV.

  5.1· 1031  Nm2kg-2(cid:3) (cid:610) L

b) These stationary states are the emitters of gravitational field with G constant.

c) The transition to stationary states in own gravitational field causes gravitational emission that
is  characterized  by  constant  K,  and  with  this  is  the  emission  of  the  same  level  with
electromagnetic (electric charge e, gravitational charge
). In this respect it is meaningless
to  say that  gravitational effects  in quantum area  are characterized  by G constant, this  constant
belongs only to microscopic level and it cannot be transferred to quantum level (which is evident
from  negative  results  of  gravitational  waves  with  G  constant  registration  tests,  these  do  not
exist).

d) The existence of stationary states in own gravitational field also  completely corresponds the
special  relativity  theory.  According  to  SRT,  relativistic  link  between  energy  and  impulse  is
broken,  if we  assume that  full  electron’s  energy is defined  only by Lawrence’s electromagnetic
energy  [7].  If  to  expand  the  situation  it  is  as  follows  [7].  Energy  and  impulse  of  the  moving

Then  from  (6)  it  follows  that  full  energy  of  resting  electron  equals  to

2. Macroscopic development of emitted gravitational field’s properties.

For  the  energies  of  transition  over  stationary  states  in  own  gravitational  field  that  were
mentioned above and energy level width, the only object within which gravitational emission can
be actualized  as a mass phenomenon is dense high temperature plasma [3]. In DT or DD plasma
the  conditions  of  gravitational  emission  excitation,  with  its  further  emission  over  the  whole
spectrum  from  eV  to  keV of  emitted  gravitons’  energy  values,  are  met.  However,  along  with
interim cascade transitions  from higher to  lower  levels (picture 1) there are straight  transitions
with keV energy levels. Emission of this kind of transitions leaves plasma freely in distinction
from eV emission,  locked in plasma and then suppressing plasma. It  is understood that in such
conditions  there  is  no  increase  in  gravitational  emission.    The  best  variant  would  be  the
appearance  of  local  in  time  and  space  high-temperature  formations  (micro  pinch),  or
anomalously high  short  time  heating  of  ionic  component  [8].  Adding  multi  charge  ions  to
hydrogen  plasma  (with  ions  having  electron  shell’s  energy  levels  close  to  energy  levels  of
electrons  in  proper  gravitational  field)  will  result  in  keV-level  excitation  state  quenching.
Together with cascade transitions this will cause gravitational emission energy transfer to  long
eV  range  energy  spectrum.    With  this  the  presence  of  impurity  of  multi  electronic  atoms  in
hydrogen plasma will provide locking and increasing gravitational emission in plasma. It should
be  noted  that  is  well  known  in  optical  range  (fluorescence)  and  broadly  used  for  quenching
optical range emission lines. This is exactly the mechanism of keeping plasma which is emitted
by  the  gravitational  field  in  addition  to  the  magnetic  way  of  keeping  plasma.  It  can  be  most
clearly seen from the  movement  of the particle  equation  in classical approach (and  long  wave
part of the emitted gravitational field complies with it), which is as follows:

At the same time both actions should obviously take turns in a way which is described in [3, 4]:
heating of plasma with the help of magnetic field compression, it’s following injection out of the
magnetic field for the last phase of compression and keeping plasma emitted by the gravitational
field. It is well known that ions of carbon, krypton and especially xenon (especially the latter) are

highly  emitting  systems  what  results  in  the  loss  of  plasma’s  energy  while  compressing  and
heating.  This  is  so  indeed  can  be  considered  to  be  a  drawback  of  the  first  phase  of  plasma
compressing  and  heating.  But  at  the  same  time  this  will be  an advantage  at  the  final phase,  as
keeping plasma emitted by the gravitational field  and the flowing reaction of synthesis, energy
withdrawal  from  plasma  can  only  take  place  as  a  type  of  electromagnetic  energy  emission
(where  it’s  main  part  will  be  shifted  to  optical  zone  exactly  when  flowing  of  synthesis  takes
place). We deliberately do not mention the role of fluctuations of plasma’s characteristic, coming
to nothing more than Maxwellian distribution (to estimate gravitational emission capacity [3, 4]),
as a minimum realizable choice. In fact the action itself taking into consideration the fluctuations
for example electrostatic inner field strength [9] seems to be more optimistic.

Thus  gravitational  emission  can  be  exited  in  dense  high  temperature  plasma  and  can  be
magnified  in  some  conditions,  but  its  magnification  leads  to  compression  of  emitting  system.
Consequently,  when  gravitational  emission  is  magnified  it  is  possible  to  observe  not  the
gravitational  emission  itself,  but  only  the  result  of  its  activity.  This  circumstance  complicates
defying of electron’s stationary state in own gravitational field spectrum numeric characteristics
in  experiments  with  plasma.  There  are,  however,  processes  that  are  not  connected  with
magnifying the emission, within which the effects of gravitational emission can be observed per
se.

In  technical  terms  the  most  accessible  is  the  usage  of  electron  beams,  but  taking  into
consideration  the  condition  mentioned  in  [4]  (the  smallness  of  energy  level  range  of  beam
electrons stationary states in own gravitational field).  In a rough approximation the evaluation of
stationary  states’  in  own  gravitational  field  energies  numeric  values  gives  the  following

Undoubtedly, numeric values of the general stationary state energy

as well as the range of stationary states energies equal 171 keV, i.e. approaching closer to
energy spectrum numeric values can be estimated more accurately. The largest inaccuracy takes
place during the estimation of the first stationary state’s numeric value (and of course of a few
next ones) and it gets smaller when approaching closer to ¥E . The idea of the experiment is that
after  stopping  electrons  beam  on  the  target  (together  with  well-known  and  thoroughly  studied
continuous spectrum of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung) the gravitational braking emission with
linear  spectrum  will  also  take  place.  Due  to  recoil  during  emission,  linear  spectrum  of
gravitational emission energy will drift  against transition energies

value of this drift ED

From  (10)  it  is  clear  that  energies  of  gravitational  emissions  spectrum  lines  have  drifted
against transition energies within a frame of 6 keV to 30 keV (and again with great accuracy for
the  upper  energy  levels  of  electron  in  own  gravitational  field).  Consequently,  gravitational
emission’s linear spectrum is surely in the range of energies (70-140) keV (probably, it  is even
drifted  downwards  in  energy  value).  Unlike  well-known  ways  of  electromagnetic  emission

registration (along all of its range), for gravitational emission there are no such registration ways,
however gravitational emission’s linear spectrum allows us use this feature in comparison with
continuous  spectrum  of  Bremsstrahlung  in  the  ranges  with  concurrent  energies.  Herewith,
overlapping of the characteristic electromagnetic emission lines and Bremsstrahlung continuous
range should  naturally  be  taken into  consideration.  Quantitative character  of the  experiment  is
well illustrated by the example of possible emission spectrum of concrete metal anode. The right
part  of  Fig.  2  shows  the  spectrum  of  Bremsstrahlung  rhodium  anode  with  overlapping
characteristic anode emission lines. These data is widely known [10] and are only given for the
purpose  of  comparison.  Possible  Bremsstrahlung  spectrum  with  overlapping  gravitational
emission lines is given on the left.

Figure  2.  Possible  character  of  gravitational  emission  lines  on  rhodium  anode  (Rh)
overlapping  with  continuous  spectrum  of  Bremsstrahlung  (on  the  left  side);  on  the  right  side
characteristic  electromagnetic  emission  lines  also  overlapping  with  continuous  spectrum  of
Bremsstrahlung are given for the purpose of comparison (line a -Ru belongs to ruthenium, which
is an impurity element in rhodium sample).

Expected  result  of  gravitational  emission  spectrum  lines  registration  is  based  on  the  notion
that  gravity  quantum  influence  on  detector  would  be  energetically  similar  to  the  influence  of
photon. The main problem would be the defining power of the detector, taking into consideration
small width of gravitational emission’s  lines.  Practically,  with this will be connected the  main
difficulty  with  registration  of  lines  within  long  wave  range  (0.01  –  0.04)  Å,  corresponding  to
electron’s  gravitational  emission  spectrum.  It  is  also  understood  that  calculations  should  be
carried  out  at  different  values  of  accelerating  electron’s  potential,  but  in  any  case  providing
emission  range  (0,01  –  0,04)Å.  And  as  the  character  of  used  metal  anode’s  characteristic
emission  spectrum  is  well-known,  it  will  allow  evading  mistakes  during  identification  of
registered lines, as lines of gravitational emission’s spectrum

Decay  (12)  is  energetically  limited  by  energy  values  of  1  MeV  order  (in  rough

Experimental  measurements  of  electrons’  angular distribution (after  passing  anode
diaphragm) in the field of electrons’ exited states (with accelerating potential values ~ 40 kV
and lower) are standard and are necessary for comparative analyses. On Fig. 3 as a visual aid
there  are  a)  scheme  of  experiments  (cid:572)(cid:621),  b)  example  of  (cid:533)  spectrum.  With  the  presence  of

Conclusion.

1.

Identification  of  electrons’  gravitational  emission  spectrum  lines  can  be  carried  out
during experiments with electron beams on spectrum lines that are analogous to the lines
of characteristic electromagnetic emission of target in wave length range (0,01 – 0,04)Å.

2 . Electrons’  states  in  (cid:533)-decay  can  be  analogous  to  exited  electrons’  states  in  own
gravitational field; it can be verified by registration of electrons distribution over energy
range  after  electron  beam  passes  foil  anode  diaphragm  with  values  of  accelerating
potential of the beam, necessary to provide exited states if the electrons in energy range
~(40  –  171)    keV  and  without  them  (with  lower  values  of  accelerating  potential).

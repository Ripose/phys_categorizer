A novel method for doping plasmas in pulsed-power experiments with gaseous elements has been
developed. A fast gas valve, a nozzle, and a skimmer are used to generate an ultrasonic gas beam
that is injected into a planar-geometry microsecond plasma-opening switch (cid:126)POS(cid:33). An array of
ionization probes with relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions was developed for diagnosing
the absolute injected-gas density and its spatial proﬁle. The properties of the gas column were also
studied using spectroscopy of line emission that results from the interaction of the doped gas with
the POS preﬁlled plasma. The doped column is found to have a width of (cid:39)1 cm and a density of
(0.8– 1.7)(cid:51)1014 cm(cid:50)3. Observations of characteristic emission lines from the doped atoms and
their ions allow for various spectroscopic measurements, such as the magnetic ﬁeld from Zeeman
splitting and the ion velocity distributions from Doppler shifts, that are local in three dimensions. It
is shown that this gas doping technique can also be used to study proton-dominated plasmas that
cannot be studied with simple emission spectroscopy due to the lack of light emitting ions. The
variety of gases used with this method, together with the small valve dimensions and its fast
opening, make it potentially useful for broad diagnostics of various short-duration plasma
experiments. © 1998 American Institute of Physics. (cid:64)S0034-6748(cid:126)98(cid:33)03503-5(cid:35)

I. INTRODUCTION

The investigations of pulsed-power systems such as
electron-beam diodes,1 ion diodes,2 z pinches,3 and plasma
opening switches4–6 (cid:126)POS(cid:33) requires the use of nonperturbing
techniques with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Meth-
ods based on interferometry7 and emission spectroscopy,8
highly advantageous for this purpose, suffer from the ambi-
guity caused by the measurement integration along the line
of sight. For spectroscopic measurements, spatial resolution
along the line of sight can be obtained by locally doping the
plasma with selected species. To this end, we developed
various doping techniques such as doping dielectric elec-
trodes undergoing ﬂashover9 and laser evaporation of coated
electrodes.10 Here, we report on the development of molecu-
lar beam injection, previously used in chemistry studies,11 to
locally dope the plasma in a POS experiment with various
species used to select emission lines for different spectro-
scopic observations. Unlike the previously reported method
based on laser evaporation,10 the present method allows for
the injection of gaseous atoms for which the ionization times
are sufﬁciently long to extend the measurement of line inten-
sities and spectral proﬁles to a longer period during the
switch operation. Evidently, line emission from ions pro-
duced due to the ionization of the injected atoms can also be
used for various measurements, as is shown below.

In doping plasmas, it is required that the density of the
doped atoms and their ions be sufﬁciently low so as to cause
no signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the properties of the plasma
studied. In addition, in order to obtain local measurements,

the doped region has to be signiﬁcantly smaller than the
plasma. This necessitates an injected gas beam that is satis-
factorily collimated and that has a sufﬁciently sharp front,
which allows for a short time delay between the gas injection
and the application of the pulse that powers the device, thus
minimizing gas scattering from electrode surfaces.

Our doping arrangement is presently used to investigate
a planar-geometry POS with a peak current of 180 kA con-
ducted by the plasma for 400–600 ns before the switch
opens into an inductive load within less than 100 ns. The
plasma used to preﬁll the POS region is generated by a ﬂash-
board plasma source12 and is injected through slots in the
anode into the 2.6-cm-wide interelectrode gap (cid:126)along the x
direction, see Fig. 1(cid:33), ﬁlling a region 14 cm wide (cid:126)along the
y direction(cid:33) and 8–10 cm long (cid:126)along the z direction(cid:33). The
ﬂashboard consists of sixteen parallel chains, each with 12
ﬂashover gaps, and is driven by a 2.8 (cid:109)F capacitor charged
to 35 kV.

The present POS experiment is designed for studying the
interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld due to the applied
current and the plasma, with the aim of determining the mag-
netic ﬁeld distribution with satisfactory spatial resolution us-
ing observations of line-emission Zeeman splitting.13 For
Zeeman splitting measurements, the Doppler broadening of
the spectral lines should be minimized, which can be ob-
tained by using emission from atoms (cid:126)that are not accelerated
by the magnetic ﬁelds(cid:33). The plasma doping method was also
utilized here to measure the velocities of various ions (cid:126)HeII,
NeII, ArIII, and XeII(cid:33) by observing the line-emission Doppler
shifts. Measurements for
ions of different charges and
masses can be used to study the details of the ion accelera-
tion under the magnetic-ﬁeld gradients and the ion collision-

FIG. 1. The experimental system used to study the planar geometry POS.
The interelectrode region is preﬁlled with plasma generated using a ﬂash-
board source and injected through slots in the anode. A fast gas valve, a
nozzle, and a skimmer are used to inject a molecular beam for locally
doping the plasma with various species. Light emitted from the doped col-
umn is collected by a lens parallel to the electrodes and focused onto a
spectrometer, the output of which is focused by a cylindrical lens onto a
rectangular ﬁber-bundle array which passes the light to 12 photomultiplier
tubes.

ality. Furthermore, the electron density and temperature can
be studied from the temporal evolution of various emission
line intensities.

An additional advantage in employing doping in spectro-
scopic measurements is that it allows for spectroscopic de-
termination of the properties of plasmas from which no sig-
niﬁcant

plasmas. In this case, line emission from the doped particles,
excited by the plasma electrons, is used to obtain the plasma
electron density and temperature.

line emission is available,

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The doping arrangement consists of a fast gas valve14
and a 0.8-mm-diam nozzle. The valve is driven by a 2 (cid:109)F, 6
kV capacitor discharged through a low inductance strip line.
A skimmer is placed approximately 5 cm from the nozzle to
further collimate the gas beam before it enters the POS re-
gion through a 1-cm-diam hole in the cathode. Skimmers
with apertures in the range of 0.3–0.7 cm in diameter were
used. The gas is supplied to the valve from an external res-
ervoir at a pressure of 8 atm. The position of gas injection
can be moved in two dimensions in order to dope the POS
plasma in different regions in different experiments. In the
present experiments, no differential pumping is required
since we operate in single pulse mode. Figure 1 shows the
experimental setup of the POS, the gas-doping arrangement,
and the spectroscopic diagnostics. The gas-beam spatial pro-
ﬁle and absolute density were diagnosed using both an array
of ionization probes and spectroscopic methods. For the ion-
ization probe measurements, we adopted a design similar to
the one proposed by Schulz,15 that allows for measurements
in the range of 10(cid:50)5 – 1 Torr. Figure 2 shows the scheme of
our ionization probe array. A single 0.2-mm-diam tungsten
wire was used as a ﬁlament to supply thermal electron emis-
sion to four ionizing cells. The dimensions of each cathode
cell are 3(cid:51)0.7(cid:51)0.4 cm and the anode plate is 0.5 cm wide

FIG. 2. The ionization-probe array. A single ﬁlament supplies thermal elec-
trons to all four probes. Four anodes and ion collectors are used to collect
the electrons and ions. A spring is used to maintain the tension in the
ﬁlament during its heating. The preampliﬁers are placed near the probes in
order to obtain a satisfactory temporal response.

and is placed 0.2 cm above the ﬁlament in order to maximize
the electric ﬁeld required for electron acceleration.

The structure of the ionization probes is so designed to
maximize the free gas ﬂow in order to minimize the pertur-
bation to the original gas beam density. The ion collectors
are bent at the front of the probe in order to shield the ﬁla-
ment from direct impact by the gas beam that results in a
drop in the electron emission during the measurement due to
the cooling and the contamination of the hot ﬁlament. The
side walls of the ion collectors separate the cells in order to
minimize the ion current between the adjacent channels.

A voltage of 100 V relative to the grounded ion collec-
tors is applied to the anodes and the ﬁlament is biased at 10
V. For some gases, with high ionization rates, the anodes
were only charged to 60 V in order to obtain a larger linear
detection range. The heating of the ﬁlament is controlled by
a standard dc feed-back loop that stabilizes the total electron
emission current at 200 (cid:109)A. The ion currents from the four
cathodes are ampliﬁed by preampliﬁers placed near the
probes. This allows the time response of the signals to be as
low as 1 (cid:109)s and the maximum cross talk between the differ-
ent channels (cid:126)that mainly stems from stray capacitance in the
preampliﬁer circuit(cid:33) to be about 5% at a frequency around 1
MHz.

The measurements with the ionization probe array were
carried out with an experimental setup identical to that of the
POS experiment except that the anode was removed to allow
the probes to be inserted at different heights above the cath-
ode.

The ionization probes were calibrated in dc mode for
various operating gases using a known pressure. A 1 mTorr
Mclaud gauge and a thermocouple were used as reference
gauges and the pressure in the vacuum vessel was controlled
by a needle valve during the calibration process. Figure 3
shows a calibration plot for He. The probes showed no satu-
ration for pressures below 0.1 Torr (cid:126)a gas density of 3.5
(cid:51)1015 cm(cid:50)3) for all gases used.

The spatial density proﬁle of the gas beam was also de-
termined using line emission from the injected gas. To this

helium. Both the horizontal and vertical errors are less than (cid:54)5% except at
pressures below 0.01 Torr, where the horizontal error is (cid:54)0.5 mTorr be-
cause of the limitation of the Mclaud gauge.

end, the ﬂashboard plasma was injected in order to allow for
excitations of the doped atoms. The line emission intensity
can be assumed to be proportional to the gas density, based
on the uniformity of (cid:54)5% found for the ﬂashboard plasma
over a 1-cm-long region. Unlike the ionization probe mea-
surement, in these measurements, the anode strips were not
removed. This allows for the determination of the gas beam
proﬁle using the true experimental POS geometry, for which
scattering from the anode strips is possible.

The spectroscopic diagnostic system consists of a 1 m
spectrometer for the range 2000–7500 Å, equipped with a
2400 grooves/mm grating. The light from the doped column
is imaged onto the spectrometer using a lens and mirrors
with a spatial resolution of 0.4 cm. A cylindrical lens images
the light at the output of the spectrometer onto a rectangular
ﬁber-bundle array, that transmits the light to a set of photo-
multiplier tubes. The output from the 12 photomultipliers is
recorded by a multichannel digitizer, which gives the time
dependent spectral line proﬁle in a single discharge.

III. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS

A. Characterization of the doped-gas beam

In our measurements, the gas spatial density proﬁle per-
pendicular to its propagation was determined for various gas
species at various distances from the valve. Figure 4(cid:126)a(cid:33)
shows traces of the four channels of the ionization probe
array as a function of time for helium. The signals are ob-
tained at a distance of 10 cm from the valve and are trans-
lated to density using the probe calibration. Probe No. 2
shows signiﬁcantly larger signals than the other probes at t
(cid:53)55– 80 ns which indicates a narrow density proﬁle at these
times. Also, this ﬁgure shows the relatively fast rise of the
gas density (cid:126)(cid:39)5 (cid:109)s(cid:33), followed by a drop of the gas density
within 15 (cid:109)s. Figure 4(cid:126)b(cid:33) shows the signal of the central
channel of the ionization probe array obtained in four differ-

ent discharges using argon. Comparison to Fig. 4(cid:126)a(cid:33) shows
the longer delay for the argon arrival and the longer pulse
duration typical for heavier gases. For He and Ar, the gas
velocity was found to be (1.9(cid:54)0.1)(cid:51)105 and (7(cid:54)0.5)
(cid:51)104 cm/s, respectively. These velocities are used for select-
ing the time delay between the operation of the valve and the
application of the current to the ﬂashboard plasma source.
The data in Fig. 4(cid:126)b(cid:33) also show that the reproducibility of the
gas density is about (cid:54)8%.

An absolute density proﬁle obtained using the ionization
probe array with helium, is shown in Fig. 5(cid:126)a(cid:33) for three po-
sitions in the anode-cathode gap. The peak gas density varies
from 0.8(cid:51)1014 cm(cid:50)3 near the anode to 1.7(cid:51)1014 cm(cid:50)3 near
the cathode. In these experiments, a skimmer with an aper-
ture of 0.3 cm was used, yielding column full width at half
maximum (cid:126)FWHM(cid:33) between 0.7 and 0.8 cm. In part of these
spectroscopic measurements, a skimmer with a larger aper-
ture could be used to allow for higher light intensities at the
expense of the spatial resolution. For example, Fig. 5(cid:126)b(cid:33)
shows a proﬁle of the HeI 3d( 1D) level population, obtained
from the 6678 Å line intensity, using a skimmer with rela-
tively large aperture (cid:126)(cid:66)(cid:53)0.7 cm(cid:33). The FWHM of the gas
proﬁles were found to be 1.2–1.6 cm for this larger skimmer.

B. Studies of the POS plasma

In this section we present examples of the use of the
present doping arrangement in the investigation of the ﬂash-
board plasma and the POS (cid:126)further results will be published
elsewhere(cid:33). The front of the plasma injected from the ﬂash-
board reaches the POS region about 600 ns after the opera-
tion of the ﬂashboard and provides nearly no line emission,

ns is broadened by the ﬁeld, and the one at 230 ns shows splitting by the
ﬁeld. The proﬁles are ﬁtted by two split Gaussians. The ion temperature is
less than 1 eV, giving a proﬁle that is dominated by the instrumental broad-
ening. The spatial resolution along the line of sight is (cid:39)1.5 cm, and the
temporal resolution is (cid:54)20 ns at t(cid:53)110 and (cid:54)10 ns at later times.

presumably since the front mainly consists of protons. The
electron density of this plasma was determined from Stark
broadening of doped-hydrogen lines and found to be (cid:39)3
(cid:51)1014 cm(cid:50)3. The electron temperature of this proton plasma
was determined from the time behavior of line intensities of
doped fast-ionizing species such as ArI, CI, and hydrogen.
These line intensities are seen to drop as a result of ioniza-
tion, and the ionization times thus obtained, together with the
knowledge of the electron density and the use of collisional-
radiative calculations,16 allowed for the determination of the
electron temperature, found to be 8–10 eV. This technique
can also be used to study electron ﬂow and proton plasmas
between the POS and the load,17,10 which is important for the
understanding of the energy coupling to the load.

The electron density of the ﬂashboard plasma, deter-
mined from Stark broadening of hydrogen lines, was seen to
increase to 1(cid:51)1015 cm(cid:50)3 about 0.6 (cid:109)s later. At this time, the
fraction of the CIII and CIV ions in the plasma was found to
be higher, i.e., particles heavier than protons reached the
POS gap. Line emission of doped particles that ionize slowly
such as HeI, ArII, and CII, and thus provide intense lines for
a relatively long time, were used to determine the electron
temperature at this time. The electron temperature at this
time was found to be 4.5(cid:54)0.5 eV, which is signiﬁcantly
lower than in the proton plasma.

The local axial

ion velocities during the POS high-
current pulse were determined from Doppler shifts of lines of
various species injected into the plasma. Figure 6 shows the
time dependent axial velocity of HeII, resulting from the ion-

gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld. The start time of the HeII
acceleration at different z locations allows the magnetic ﬁeld
average axial propagation velocity to be determined, found
to be (2.8(cid:54)0.3)(cid:51)107 cm/s. The velocities at larger- z loca-
tions rise to higher values since the velocity rise at these
locations occurs at later times and the POS current rises in
time. The relatively strong dependence of the ion velocities
on the axial position demonstrates the need for local obser-
vations, made possible by the present doping technique.

Our doping technique also allowed for local determina-
tion of the magnetic ﬁeld using line-emission Zeeman split-
ting. To this end, we observed the spectral proﬁle of the
helium atom 6678 Å line in the direction of the magnetic
ﬁeld (cid:126)along the ‘‘Y ’’ direction, see Fig. 1(cid:33), thus only observ-
ing the (cid:115) components. Figure 7 shows the line proﬁle at t
(cid:53)110, 160, and 230 ns in the middle of the Y and Z dimen-
sions of the POS (cid:126)see Fig. 1(cid:33), and at 0.5 cm from the cath-
ode. The line width of the HeI line is dominated by the
instrumental broadening since the Doppler broadening re-
mains small throughout the pulse (cid:126)the ion-atom collisionality
is too low to cause a momentum transfer from the acceler-
ated ions to the neutral particles(cid:33). The line proﬁle is ﬁtted by
two Gaussians (cid:126)whose width is determined by the instrumen-
tal broadening(cid:33) and the splitting between them yields the
magnetic ﬁeld. Zeeman splitting is clearly seen at t(cid:53)230 ns,
giving 0.7(cid:54)0.1 T for the magnetic ﬁeld amplitude. To within
the uncertainties, the magnetic ﬁeld propagation velocity ob-
tained from the Zeeman splitting and the ion acceleration
measurements are in agreement with each other. Further
measurements using this method,
including complete 3D
mapping of the magnetic ﬁeld, are currently in progress.

We present a unique geometrical model based on our findings of a quantum vacuum 
charge  scenario  to  predict  the  recent  experimental  find  of  the  new  HyperCP  214  MeV 
particle  state  X.    This  model,  which  we  call  the  Spin  Matrix,  also  predicts  many  more 
states; some of which represent known particles and some states that aren’t represented 
directly by known particles or haven’t been experimentally found yet.  We demonstrate a 
parameter-free description of the lowest energy particles in nature.  

1.  Introduction 

During  this  year,  2005,  the  HyperCP  collaboration  at  Fermilab  announced  a  new  rare 
particle  at  approximately  214  MeV  that  was  found  in  their  data  [1].    This  find  allowed  us  to 
modify our Spin Matrix geometry model of the organized part of the quantum vacuum that we 
presented in a previous paper to better fit existing data [2].  Starting with the rest mass energy of 
a positron we predict the rest mass energies of the up and down quarks, the p 0 meson and now 
this new X particle at 214 MeV using our geometrical model modified by a fitting function.  We 
also predict other energy states that don’t directly relate to elementary particles of the Standard 
Model but they possibly do relate to higher resonances of composites. 

In this paper we will discuss more details about our Spin Matrix geometrical model and how 
its basic linear geometrical configuration must be modified for higher energy non-linearities.  We 
use the term Dual Spacetime to imagine this concept and Spin Matrix for the organized part of 
the quantum vacuum that is mostly hidden from us.  Our model is much like a modified Dirac 
Sea  that  involves  two  3-branes  connected  by  a  common  2D  surface  boundary.    This  type  of 
concept has become popular in recent years with the advent of the Randall-Sundrum papers [3]. 

Another very important feature of our Spin Matrix geometry is chiral symmetry and how it 
is broken.  And maybe a clue to how chiral symmetry is restored at higher energies.  It will be 
easy to see that there is a mix of energy states that probably have chiral symmetry and some that 
don’t.    But  first  we  need  to  say  that  our  energy  states  represented  by  the  circular  areas  are 
composites of fermion / anti-fermion pairs resulting from our perspective that they are much like 
Goldstone bosons with zero overall spin and zero mass.  However, we must also take heed to the 
Anyon hypothesis and that some of these energy states might be neither fermionic nor bosonic in 
content.  Which leads to fractional statistics [4].  For the most part of this letter though, we will 
assume that the content of the energy states to be fermionic / anti-fermionic pairs which ought to 
behave similar to Cooper pairs from BCS theory [5]. 

And of course, this Spin Matrix geometry can explain why there is a mass gap in the first 
place since it only allows certain energy states to exist due to its interactional equilibrium.  We 
can easily see from the geometry that e+e- pairs are the first to come out of the Spin Matrix into

our spacetime and then pions with respect to first generation particles.  We must admit that we 
don’t  seem  to  see  the  presence  of  2nd  or  3rd  generation  fermions  in  this  scenario  yet.    But  we 
expect that a less trivial geometric scheme must produce them.   

II.  The Spin Matrix Geometry 

In the previous paper, we also presented the concept of quantum vacuum charge (QVC) = 
(cid:1)  and we showed that it works very well for the bound charge of free space photons [2].  
c
This is what led us to the concept of the Spin Matrix geometry.  For QVC to be a reality, then 
there must  be some kind of quantum mechanism to support it.  One naturally thinks of virtual 
fermionic  pairs surrounding real charged elementary particles and QVC is an extension of that 
screening.  When we say “fermionic pair” we mean with a fermion and anti-fermion of the same 
particle flavor. 

Our Spin Matrix geometrical model of the quantum vacuum is fairly simple and is based on 
the  idea  that  the  quantum  vacuum  should  have  properties  that  dictate  what  we  see  as  the  real 
elementary particle spectrum.  In other words, an organization amidst the quantum chaos.  It is 
strictly two-dimensional and can be seen in the figures that follow.  It is basically a Dirac-like 
Sea concept except that only certain energy states are allowed by the geometry instead of having 
a  continuum  of  possible  energy  states.    Now  in  thinking  of  a  Dirac  Sea  concept,  we  have  to 
imagine that the “Sea” would have to be composed of “less than virtual” (LTV) fermionic pairs.  
Of course this presents the usual problem of where is this sea of LTV fermions?  We think it is 
mostly hidden from us on the other side of an event horizon.  In other words, there are two 3-
branes connected by a common 2D surface or event horizon.  Our 2D Spin Matrix is the view of 
looking  from  our  brane  into  the  brane  on  “the  other  side  of  the  looking  glass”  on  a  very 
microscopic level.  This concept of a sea of LTV fermionic pairs, immediately allows for virtual 
fermionic  pairs  to  exist.    Virtual  fermionic  pairs  are  simply  the  state  of  being  between  both 
“worlds”.    When  we  say  “less  than  virtual”  we  mean  the  set  of  particles  that  are  in  the  other 
brane that we can have no direct contact with because they are beyond the event horizon.  This is 
similar to the concept that we can have no direct contact with particles that might be in a black 
hole. 

The dual space-time scenario that we are thinking of would have to be similar to a Dirac Sea 
only  modified  so  that  it  can  work.    And  we  must  turn  to  cosmology  for  a  more  complete 
description  to  help  with  this.    There  is  really  good  evidence  that  there  was  some  kind  of  Big 
Bang event that started our Universe so it is easy to imagine that there is an event horizon that is 
associated with our Universe’s “now”.  This event horizon must be physically moving at c right 
now.  This gives us a necessary boundary between the two spacetimes.  And better allows for a 
modified Dirac Sea concept to work.   

Figure1 shows a two dimensional hexagonal configuration of the Spin Matrix.  We can see 
that  this  produces  areas  that  are  "isolated"  from  each  other  in  the  space  where  the  3.3  MeV 
energy states form and this immediately brings to mind regions where the "weak" and "strong" 
interactions operate.  And that higher energy states can form in the smaller spaces.  The hexagon 
outlined in Fig.1 would be a "cell" of the Spin Matrix.  We call this cell a zerton and it should 
(cid:1) for its overall charge.   It can also be seen that the  electromagnetic 
c
have the property of 
interaction  is  not  isolated  and  this  can  explain  its  "infinite"  range.    Whereas  the  smaller  areas, 
being isolated from each other, have interactions that are limited in range.  It looks like there is 

2

the  possibility  of  tunneling  between  the  isolated  regions  though.    However,  the  mechanism  of 
how all of this works in our spacetime from the Spin Matrix spacetime needs more explanation.

Fig. 1.  Hexagonal configuration of the 2D Spin Matrix boundary.  If we take the larger areas to be 

0.511 MeV, then the smaller areas shown, geometrically come out to be 3.3 MeV. 

All particles that we consider to be real in our spacetime have to have a connection to the Spin 
Matrix.  This connection would be the cloud of virtual pairs that surround all fermions.   

In Figure 2 we have zoomed in on one of the isolated regions.  To calculate the energy of 
the energy states, we set the radius of the LTV  e e+ -
 state equal to 1 and then just divide mec2 by 
the radius of the smaller circles that is calculated from the geometrical relationships to obtain an 
energy value for them.   Basically we are just making a relation of these states using the reduced 
mass formula,

similar to how a bound state like positronium would be considered so that we can have a value of 
what this state might have in relation to a value in our spacetime to a single fermion of the pair.  
From our macroscopic perspective, these states really look to have zero energy so we must use a 
microscopic perspective by just starting with what the rest mass energy of an electron or positron 
would be and scale the rest from that.  In other words, this is what a real fermion might “see” 
with  respect  to  energy  values.    The  LTV  e e+ -
  from  our  perspective  is  the  annihilated  state  of 
positronium.  An example of obtaining the energy for the state of the next smaller circle is that 
we can calculate the radius of the circle by geometry and we obtain  2 3 / 3 1 0.15470
.  Then 
for the result of the next smaller circle.  And so  on as we  go to 
em c /(2 3 / 3 -1) 3.303 MeV
smaller and smaller sized energy states (actually higher energy).  In theory it is possible to obtain 
exact  geometrical  results.    However,  because  of  the  quantum  nature  of  the  Spin  Matrix,  we 
would expect that what we are presenting are average values anywise.

In Figure 3, we obtain energy states that are close to a p 0 meson and then the HyperCP 214 
MeV X particle.  The actual linear geometrical calculations for the p 0 meson area is 142.7 MeV

and for the HyperCP X is 235.7 MeV.  At this point we make the conjecture that these energy 
states  do  represent  these  particles  and  we  apply  a  “fitting  function”  to  adjust  the  values  of  the 
Spin  Matrix  geometry.    We  will  discuss  this  function  more  later  but  basically  we  think  it  is 
necessary because of higher energy non-linearities.  So all of the values we have labeled on the 

4 

p
figures  are  the  adjusted  values.    We  think  this  “fitting”  is  due  to  the  concept  that  the  lower 
energy  states  are  softer  and  higher  energy  states  are  harder  so  that  in  reality  what  we  are 
showing as perfect circles really aren’t that perfect in the Spin Matrix quantum mechanism.  Of 
course  we  also  have  the  problem  to  figure  out  of  why  the  134.7  MeV  state  is  “picked  out”  to 
represent  the  p 0
  meson.    There  must  be  some  defining  reason  why  the  uu and  dd quarks  pick 
this current path when being excited into our spacetime from the Spin Matrix.  We also note that 
we  have  an  unexplain  state  of  14.93  MeV  in  Figure  2.    We  think  this  state  is  a  new  lightest 
Goldstone state and is yet to be discovered. 

III.   The HyperCP 214 MeV X Particle 

Recently  He,  et  al,  has  published  results  from  HyperCP  Collaboration  [6].    The  striking 
result is the discovery of a new particle X, with mass of about 214 MeV.  The authors claim an X 
to  be  narrow,  short-lived  particle,  and  non-hadronic.  They  find  that  existing  data  on 
  rule  out  a  scalar  particle  or  a  vector  particle  as  possible  explanations.    The 
K+ 
authors also explored all the existing constraints on pseudoscalar and axial vector particles, and 
conclude that these possibilities are still allowed.  Another paper further constrains the HyperCP 
find to be a pseudoscalar, which we tend to agree with [7].

One  of  the  possible  interpretations  for  new  X-particle  is  to  be  an  sgoldstino,  a  mystical 
object, which arises in supersymmetrical schemes [1,6,7].  The sgoldstino has spin 0 and it can 
have mass, although this mass can be quite arbitrary.  The sgoldstino is the bosonic superpartner 
for the goldstino.  But there could be different scenarios for such physics, and we will suggest 
one  of  them.    We  have  used  our  Spin  matrix model  to  calculate  masses  of  inner  energy  states 
originating from 2D structure in Figure 1 and found an energy state of the appropriate magnitude 
for  the  HyperCP  214  MeV  particle  lying  right  next  to  an  energy  state  that  we  associate  with 
pions as can be seen in Fig. 3. Our mass evaluations and predictions are essentially parameter-
free. 

IV.   X-particle Physics 

Some time ago the group of authors – Akers, Palazzi, and Mac Gregor came up with the so-
called  “An  Elementary  Particle  Constituent-Quark  Model”[8].    They  compared  meson  and 
baryon  spectra  and  found  a  common  mass-band  structure,  in  which  particles  with  a  variety  of 
quantum  numbers  are  grouped  together.    These  quantized  mass  values  seemingly  mandate  a 
constituent-quark (CQ) viewpoint.  By studying the meson and baryon  yrast states, the authors 
deduced the masses and spin values of some of the constituent quarks.  The authors’ basic claim 
is that any baryon or meson mass could be simply expressed in terms of either X1 = 35 MeV or 
X2 = 70 MeV multiple quanta.  One can see how nicely Mac Gregor’s 70 MeV quanta fits in our 
geometrical solution (see Fig.3). 

Another  novel  model  was  devised  recently  by  Walcher  [9].    This  model  describes  the 
possible  existence  of  narrow  excited  states  in  the  nucleon  sector  below  the  p N  threshold.    A 
model based on the excitation of collective states of the quark condensate is proposed explaining 
these states as multiple production of a “genuine” Goldstone boson with a mass of »
 20 MeV.  
Walcher  assumes  that  the  p
  observed  in  nature  is  not  the  Goldstone  boson  that  it  is  normally 
identified  with,  but  a  mixture  of  the  “genuine”  Goldstone  boson  p G,  i.e.  the  light  p
  suggested 
above consisting of light current quarks, with a “constituent” p c made of constituent quarks with

a mass of mp c = 2mc = 700 MeV.  Despite many promises, this model suffers a few drawbacks in 
considering  the  dynamics  of  quarks  and  pions.    We  see  how  naturally  Walcher’s  22  MeV 
Goldstone arises in our Spin Matrix construction (see Figs 2, 3).

We have obtained a universal fitting function from adjusting our linear Spin Matrix state 
 meson and the HyperCP 214 MeV energy, which works well for our purposes  

(2) 

where  x  equals  the  energy  of  the  state  from  the  Spin  Matrix  to  be  adjusted.    We  can  see  that 
eq.(2) is essentially a modification of the reduced mass eq. (1).  We would like to note that our 
factor of 0.000213 is close to 4a 2 though we have not made any definitive connection yet.  Let 
us see Figure 4 for the detailed behavior of our f(x).  It is a nearly linear function at 0 < x < 100 
MeV, then it gets some non-linearity which increases with energy and starts to flatten out in the 
200  MeV  region.    With  energy  increase,  f(x)  continues  to  behave  this  way  further,  until  it  is 
completely  flattened  out  at  about  2.4  GeV.    But  this  is  just  a  boundary  of  a  region,  which  fits 
nicely  into  color  screening  or  a  partial  confinement  scenario.    A  few  papers  by  Arbuzov  [10], 
Goldman  [11],  Garcilazo  [12],  Jaffe  [13],  Stepanov  [14]  describe  this  rich  phenomenon  via 
different models, but our 2.4 GeV value just fits in the overall parameter’s window.  Garcilazo et 
al  used  a  screened  potential  of  the  Bhaduri-type  [12]  and  explained  the  so-called  missing 
resonance problem in N- D
 

 spectra with screening boundary of just about 2.4 GeV.

Restoration  of  chiral  symmetry  can  really  be  put  on  solid  ground,  which  was  done 
recently in (cid:1)-expansion GNJL approach by Kalashnikova et al [15].  The grand result shown is – 

6 

chiral  symmetry  is  restored  high  in  the  spectrum  of  heavy-light  mesons,  and  indeed,  parity 
doubling was demonstrated to occur above the scale of about 2.5 GeV, regardless of the explicit 
form  of  the  confining  potential.    Kalashnikova  [15]  defines  this  scale  of  symmetry  restoration 
rest,  as  a  scale  at  which  splitting  within  a  chiral  doublet  is  much  smaller  than  the  BCS  scale 
L BCS  =  250  MeV.    They  also  conclude  that  chiral  symmetry  is  restored  in  the  spectrum  if  the 
pionic  wave  function  vanishes  for  given  values  of  relative  inter-quark  momentum.    But  this  is 
practically  our  asymptotic  value  of  2.4  GeV,  which  could  be  considered  as  a  point  of  phase 
transition  in  our  framework.    The  authors  [15]  identified  the  following  three  regimes  1)  chiral 
regime, p < L BCS, with chiral symmetry breaking playing a dominant role in the interaction; 3) 
the  restoration  regime,  L
rest  <  p  (p-momentum),  which  realizes  for  highly  excited  states  in 
spectrum, where parity doublets, and even chiral quartets appeared; 2) the intermediate regime, 
which interpolates regimes 1) and 3).  

Our  asymptotical  function  f(x)  can  be  mapped  into  their  three  regimes’  domain  or  vice 
versa.  The first will correspond to our e+, e-, u, d –quarks, Walcher’s (23 MeV), Mac Gregor-
Akers-Palazzi (35 MeV, 70 MeV) goldstones, and a pion (135 MeV).  The second regime will be 
home for our new X (214 MeV) particle.  Third regime will be started from the 2.4 GeV =  L
and will go all the way to E = (cid:1).  Many particles and resonances can live in II and III domains.  
 
foresee such possible parity doublets (PD) there:  

Let’s take a closer look at light unflavored mesonic sector (the biggest of all).  We can 

rest  

)) - they are vector-axial vector doublets (VAV)

We  can  also  create  P-doublets  via  different  symmetry  principles.    Now  we  have  found  the 
possible  P-doublets  in  the  light  unflavored  mesonic  sector.    These  are  f-w
  and  r -a  -families.  
Let’s consider the overlap value for different pairs in the quartets:

The first quartet has Mave1 = 1633 MeV, the second quartet has Mave2 = 2017 MeV, and the third 
quartet has Mave3 = 2262 MeV.  We are witnessing here an outstanding phenomenon, as we move 
higher in the spectrum.  An overlap is getting larger and reaches 100% for the highest two pairs.  
What is more is that high in the spectra, ALL parity doublets become degenerate and fused into 
one state.  This is exactly a harbinger for chiral symmetry restoration high in the mass spectrum!  
We note in passing that the occurrence of our 1, 2, 3 quartets resembles nicely the leveling-off 
behavior of our fitting function f(x).

From this set (5) one can see the creation of  f-a-p -h
 box with boundaries 2190-2329 MeV.  Let 
us  combine  set  (5)  with  vector-axial-vector  r -a  parity  doublets,  which  will  confine  within  a 
2186-2329  MeV  box.    As  a  result,  we  have  a  high-lying  supermultiplet,  exhibiting  a  perfect 
match between VAV parity doublets and U (1)A pairs, with box 2186-2329 MeV.  This proves 
total degeneracy of states and restoration of the chiral symmetry high in the spectrum. 

On  the  other  hand  our  extensive  research  on  hadronic  Regge  trajectories  (RT)  shows  [16] 
that  our  asymptotic  fitting  curve  f(x)  could  be  well  matched  by  the  bulk  of  the  mesonic  and 
baryonic RT’s in orbital space, i.e. M2 = M2(L, nr = fixed).  Our asymptote boundary at M = 2.4 
GeV beautifully corresponds to the flattening out of RT’s.  We know that clearly light unflavored 
mesons  and  N  -  D
  -  S
  baryonic  spectra  do  terminate  at  2.4  –  2.5  GeV  value  (and  most 
definitely by 3 GeV) [17].

V.  Conclusions 

To  this  date,  no  one  has  been  able  to  successfully  explain  the  mass  spectrum  of  all  the 
known particles.  We don’t pretend that we can fully explain it either but we expect the solution 
to be a geometrical one of some fashion.  Our 2D Spin Matrix geometry is our first attempt for a 
geometrical  solution  and  it  has  some  promising  features  that  warrant  further  investigation.  
Starting  with  the  rest  mass  energy  of  the  electron  or  positron,  our  geometry  generates  energy 
states that can be applied to the up and down quarks, pi zero mesons, the new HyperCP particle 
and many others.  We have to stress that our scheme is parameter-free. 

We can also see areas of chiral symmetry as well as areas of other symmetrical principles.  
A curious symmetry can be seen for the LTV  dd  quark areas (8.111 MeV) in one of the isolated 
regions.  It seems that these three  dd  quark areas would have to have a three-way chirality with 
respect  to  each  other.    Normally  one  thinks  of  left-handed  and  right-handed  for  chiral 
symmetries, but we are wondering what would happen if a three-way chirality was applied to the 
group theories of particle physics.  Another curious symmetry is that either the LTV  + -
e e  states 
or the LTV  uu  quark states can be the center of symmetry for our Spin Matrix geometry. 

In  presenting  this  geometrical  model,  it  is  easy  to  see  why  it  has  been  so  hard  to  find  an 
explanation  and  mathematical  formulation  for  the  particle  spectrum.    The  particle  spectrum  is 
dependent on an  equilibrium of complicated field interactions in the less than virtual sector of 
the quantum vacuum.  Perhaps our Spin Matrix is a start to finding the proper explanation.

Abstract. Logarithmic perturbation theory (LPT) is developed and applied to
quasinormal modes (QNMs) in open systems. QNMs often do not form a complete set,
so LPT is especially convenient because summation over a complete set of unperturbed
states is not required. Attention is paid to potentials with exponential tails, and
the example of a P¨oschl-Teller potential is brieﬂy discussed. A numerical method is
developed that handles the exponentially large wavefunctions which appear in dealing
with QNMs.

Introduction

1.1. Logarithmic perturbation theory

Eigenvalue problems of the type

Hφ = λφ

(1.1)

occur in many branches of physics; here λ may be related to the frequency ω by
λ = ω (Schr¨odinger equation), or by λ = ω2 (wave equation or Klein-Gordon equation).
Perturbation theory is useful for systems that depart slightly from an ideal solvable
conﬁguration. Apart from the standard Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger perturbation theory
(RSPT), a useful alternative focuses not on φ itself, but on its logarithmic derivative
f = φ′/φ. Known as logarithmic perturbation theory (LPT) [1, 2, 3, 4], this method
is commonly applied to 1-d bound state problems, especially the ground state. For
excited states, one either has to ﬁrst factor out the zeros [5], or detour around them in
the complex plane [6]. LPT has also been developed for bound states in 3 d [7]. LPT

2

avoids sums over intermediate states, and comparison with RSPT can lead to useful
sum rules [8].

The bound states, or normal modes (NMs), are solutions with φ

.
→ ±∞
Other boundary conditions are also important physically. Scattering states and the
phase shift can be handled by LPT using only on-shell information [9]. In this paper,
we develop LPT for wavefunctions that are outgoing at inﬁnity — quasinormal modes
(QNMs).

1.2. Quasinormal modes

In conservative systems, NMs are factorized solutions Φ(x, t) = e−iωtφ(x) with φ
satisfying an eigenvalue equation such as (1.1) and nodal boundary conditions at
x
. The counterparts in open systems are QNMs; these factorized solutions
satisfy outgoing wave boundary conditions at x

, so that Im ω

QNMs are important from many points of view. A laser is often discussed in
terms of its “modes”, i.e., the spectral lines with ﬁnite widths γ, which are precisely
these QNMs [10]. Quantum-mechanical resonances are likewise central to scattering
[11, 12, 13, 14], and as intermediate states in high-order transitions. Gravitational
waves from the vicinity of a black hole are likely to be detected in the next decade
by facilities such as LIGO and VIRGO [15]. The radial wavefunction describing the
propagation of gravitational waves in any angular momentum sector satisﬁes a Klein-
Gordon equation with a potential V (x) [16, 17]. Theoretical studies [18, 19] show that,
at least for an intermediate time domain, the waves are dominated by a ringing signal,
which is readily identiﬁed as the superposition of QNMs [18, 19, 20]. If the relationship
between the characteristics of the ringing signal (i.e., the QNMs) and the spacetime
curvature could be better understood, gravitational waves have the prospect of becoming
a novel astronomical probe. In these cases, the background is a Schwarzschild metric
plus perturbations (e.g., due to an accretion disk), so perturbative treatments will be
useful.

In the present context, three properties of QNMs should be emphasized. First,
their numerical determination is notoriously diﬃcult. This is most simply seen in the
“shooting” algorithm: choose an arbitrary ω, integrate from one end (say x = 0 for a
half-line problem or a full-line problem with deﬁnite parity), identify the coeﬃcient of the
), and vary ω until this coeﬃcient is zero.
“wrong” solution at the other end (say x
→ ∞
For NMs, the exponentially large “wrong” solution is readily identiﬁed. For QNMs, the
“wrong” solution, which is O(e−2γx) relative to the “right” solution, is diﬃcult to extract,
especially when γ is large. The numerical diﬃculties make perturbation methods even
more relevant than would be the case for NMs.

Secondly, RSPT is inapplicable for two reasons. Its usual derivation relies on the

3

hermiticity of the system, which is now lost. Moreover, because the QNMs are in general
not complete, one cannot sum over intermediate states. Even in circumstances where
the QNMs turn out to be complete [12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26], a scheme such as LPT
would still have deﬁnite advantages, because it makes no reference to the higher states
with large γ.

Thirdly, it is readily shown that any QNM can have at most one node on the real
x axis. Except for the origin for the odd-parity sector of symmetric potentials, there
is no reason why any root of the complex equation φ(x) = 0 should lie on the real x
axis; those cases that do are therefore “accidental” in the sense that they occur only for
speciﬁc values of the parameters deﬁning the potential V (x) — in other words on a set
of measure zero in parameter space. Therefore the nodal problem which plagues LPT
for excited NMs is here absent generally.

1.3. Outline of paper

Section 2 develops LPT for QNMs, and discusses the generalized norm that emerges
as a result. The most explicit general form for the second-order correction, together
with an illustrative example, are given in Section 3, focusing on those cases where both
the original potential and the perturbation have ﬁnite support. The situation becomes
slightly more complicated if the potentials have tails, and the case of exponential tails
is discussed in Section 4. A conclusion is given in Section 5.

First consider the central region, and put (2.4) and (2.5) into (2.2). Upon comparing

for n = 1, 2,

a shorthand for the following combination of lower-order quantities, to be called the

We now need to match the central solution to the two asymptotic regions. Assume
that the latter have been solved with outgoing wave boundary conditions at spatial

It is a property of LPT that one need focus only on one state at a time. Therefore, a label for

Note that D± will contain two types of changes from the unperturbed case. First, at
ﬁxed ω, the wavefunction when integrated inwards from
will suﬀer changes because
of V1(x) in the two asymptotic regions; these are expressed through

±∞

D±(ω) = D±0(ω) + µD±1(ω) + µ2D±2(ω) +

.

· · ·

Secondly, there will be changes because the value of ω itself shifts according to (2.4).
In particular, the exact logarithmic derivative is f±(ω, L±) = D±(ω), whereas the
corresponding unperturbed quantity is f0(L±) = D±0(ω0). Thus

g(L±) = f±(ω, L±)

f0(L±) = D±(ω)

D±0(ω0) .

Using (2.4) and (2.10) and developing the right hand side of (2.11) in powers of µ, we
can ﬁnd that fn in (2.8) should be matched to

fn(L±) = ωnD′

slightly away from the original frequency (derivatives of D0).

The division into three regions is arbitrary, and the whole expression (2.14) must
be independent of L±. Moreover, the numerator and denominator must be separately
independent of L±, because the numerator depends on the perturbation, whereas the
denominator relies only on the unperturbed system; an explicit proof can be constructed
by calculating ∂

/∂L+, and then using (2.2).

These formal expressions do not converge; (2.15) and (2.16) may be regarded as ways of
regularizing them. In Section 4 we shall discuss various diﬀerent ways of giving meanings
to these formal integrals.

Evidently, the numerator should be regarded as a generalized matrix element, and
the denominator should be regarded as a generalized norm. We now develop this
interpretation. The corrections to the eigenfunction will be given in Section 2.3.

2.2. Generalized norm and matrix element

For the simplest case where V0(x) vanishes outside the interval (L−, L+), the solutions
in the two asymptotic regions are exactly e±iωx, and D±0(ω) =
iω. The generalized
norm (2.16) simpliﬁes to

(2.19)

In this form applicable to potentials without tails, the generalized norm has been
introduced previously both for the wave equation [21, 27], the Schr¨odinger equation
[28] and the Klein-Gordon equation [24], and its properties discussed.
It has been
shown to be equivalent to another form ﬁrst given by Zeldovich [29], which did not have
the surface terms, but instead required a process of regularization [11, 12, 13] which
is less convenient for actual evaluation (especially numerical evaluation). The present
result, in the more general form (2.16), is however applicable to potentials with tails,
and examples will be given in Section 4.

We next brieﬂy describe the properties of this generalized norm, and argue why it

deserves to be so named.

First of all, suppose the system parameters can be tuned so that the leakage of
the wavefunction approaches zero (e.g., if V0(x) contains a tall barrier on both sides).
Then L± can be chosen so that φ0(L±)
0; the expression in (2.16) then contains

≈

7

only the integral. Moreover, when the leakage is zero, the frequency is real, and the
2.
wavefunction has a constant phase, which can be chosen to be real; thus φ2
φ0|
The expression (2.16) then reduces to the usual (real and positive-deﬁnite) norm for a
NM. Because of this property, and because it appears in the denominator in (2.14) to
scale the wavefunction, it is appropriate to call this quantity the generalized norm.

0 =

|

Nevertheless, it has some unusual properties. (a) It involves φ2

2,
φ0|
and is in general a complex quantity. (b) It involves a surface term, though the value
of the entire expression is independent of the choice of L±. Thus, it is not a genuine
norm, and the term is merely a shorthand for “a bilinear map that appears in the place
of the norm in perturbation formulas such as (2.14)”.

0 rather than

|

It is hardly surprising that perturbative results are expressed in the form of a matrix
element divided by a normalizing factor, as in (2.14), but it would not have been obvious
what the normalizing factor should be. The point is that for a QNM, the wavefunction

We have already remarked that the generalized norm is not real, and neither is the
(diagonal) matrix element. Far from being a problem, this is necessary, in that the
result (2.14) gives the corrections to both the real part and the imaginary part of the
frequency. Thus, despite the formal similarity to the analogous problem for NMs, the
present formalism in fact contains twice the amount of information.

Some of the properties above, in particular the validity without regularization of the
simpler form (2.17), relies on Vn behaving mildly at inﬁnity. It is therefore appropriate to
demonstrate that if the perturbation V1 has ﬁnite support, then so does all the eﬀective
potentials Vn generated via (2.7). Consider for simplicity only the asymptotic interval
(L+,
). Now the exact logarithmic derivative is iω, whereas the unperturbed analog
is iω0. This then gives

The nth order term in the above expression then ensures that Vn in (2.7) exactly vanishes
in this region.

2.3. Wavefunction

To complete the iterative procedure, we also need the eigenfunctions. This can be readily
obtained by integrating (2.8) to an arbitrary point, and using (2.11) as the boundary

One could write an alternate expression using the boundary condition at L+ and
integrating from the right. Consistency is guaranteed if ωn has been correctly evaluated
by (2.14).

Thus we have in principle an order-by-order iteration scheme for the QNMs; namely,
use (2.14) to obtain ω1, and (2.21) to get f1; this is then put into (2.7) to ﬁnd V2, etc.

3. Explicit form of higher-order corrections and an example

3.1. Higher-order corrections

The perturbative formulas would be more useful if they could be written explicitly rather
than recursively. In general, the nth order correction to the frequency must take the
V (xn); moreover, the perturbing potential can only
form of an integral over V (x1)
act if it is “sampled” by the wavefunction φ2
0(x). It will also turn out to be convenient
to remove a constant from V1, and we are led to deﬁne

· · ·

W (x) = [V1(x)

2ω0ω1] φ2

0(x) .

−

(3.1)

The constant subtracted renders the integral of W zero (see (2.14)).

Thus we expect to be able to write the nth order correction in the form

We now try to write out ω2 in essentially this form, and evaluate the weight function
Ψ2. For this purpose we consider the simpler case of a half line 0 < x <
, with the
potentials satisfying V0(x) = V1(x) = 0 for x > a, and all φ(x = 0) = 0. (This may
be regarded as the odd-parity sector of a symmetric problem.) Thus, all the surface
contributions at L− are eliminated, while at the right hand side we may take L+ = a
and D′

+0 = i. Thus, the generalized norm is

Thus, except for the last two terms in (3.5), which do not involve an integral, the second-

for an arbitrary perturbation.

We now illustrate these formulas by a very simple example. Let the unperturbed system

These formulas then allow the corrections for any perturbation V1 to be obtained

Figure 1 shows the trajectory of the lowest eigenvalue, ω, in the complex frequency
plane as x0 is changed, for ﬁxed V0 = 100, b = 1, µ = 10, w = 0.1 and (a) V1 lying
inside the interval (0, b), (b) V1 lying outside the interval (0, b); the exact results (circles),
ﬁrst-order perturbation computed by (3.11) (dashed line) and second-order perturbation
computed by (3.5) (solid line) are shown together for comparison. Figure 2 shows the
magnitude of the remaining error for the unperturbed eigenvalue (solid line), ﬁrst-order
perturbation (dashed line) and second-order perturbation (long broken line) versus µ,
for ﬁxed V0 = 100, b = 1, w = 1 and (a) x0 = 0.3, (b) x0 = 1.4.

Although this example is extremely simple, it illustrates several interesting features.
First, the remaining error of the nth-order perturbation scales as µn+1, as expected.
This is the case even for the perturbation lying outside the interval (0, b) (Figure 2b),
in which case the spectrum of QNMs is not complete, and it is not possible to write the
second-order correction as a sum over intermediate QNMs; this result for the second-
order correction is testimony to the utility of LPT (as opposed to RSPT).

Comparison between the two cases in Figure 2a and 2b also reveals that higher-order
corrections are more signiﬁcant when the perturbation acts at a more distant position,
where

2 is large.

The behavior in Figure 1 is even more interesting, showing a spiral structure as
the position x0 is changed. Although the perturbation is real and positive, the shift
can have any phase depending on where the perturbation acts — a situation totally

in ﬁrst-order perturbation theory, for which the general result (2.14) can be written as

the results for a model astrophysical perturbation of a black hole has been given recently
[30].

4. Potentials with tails

4.1. The P¨oschl-Teller Potential

When dealing with QNMs, one recurring complexity is the asymptotic behavior φ2
∼
e2γ0|x|, making norms and matrix elements divergent. As far as LPT is concerned,
this complication occurs at two diﬀerent levels. If the potential (and its perturbation)
vanishes outside a ﬁnite domain, then the expression (2.19) suﬃces to produce a ﬁnite
expression for the norm, whereas the matrix elements involve integrals only over ﬁnite
domains. Such simpliﬁcations also extend to potentials that vanish at inﬁnity faster
than any exponential. However, when the potential (or its perturbation) decays as an
exponential or slower (which we shall refer to as a tail), then the evaluation of the norm
and the matrix element will require more attention.

0(x)

In this Section we illustrate the solution of these problems with the example of the

P¨oschl-Teller (P-T) potential [31]

V (x) = V0 cosh−2(x/b) .

a few exactly solvable models, has been studied in depth,
the Regge-Wheeler potential [16, 18, 19] or the Zerilli potential [17], which describes
linearized gravitational waves propagating on a Schwarzschild background. These also
have exponential tails (as the tortoise coordinate x
, i.e., towards the event
horizon), and consequently their QNMs share certain key properties with those of the
P-T potential (e.g., a string of QNMs evenly spaced “vertically” in the complex ω-plane,
). Therefore a better understanding of the exponential tails may

We show three diﬀerent ways of handling the divergent integrals (2.17) and (2.18). The
ﬁrst two methods are speciﬁc to the P-T potential (or other potentials amenable to
analytic treatment), but these lead to the third method, which is numerical and can
be applied to any potential with exponential tails. The last method will be the one of
general interest.

4.2. Analytic continuation

Consider for example the j = 0 state. The unperturbed eigenfunction is

φ0(x) = (cosh x)iω ,

j = 0 ,

(4.6)

This expression applies only for ω equal to the eigenvalue; otherwise there is another term with an

Now it is easily shown, using even the crudest approximation D+ = iω0, that K(L) =

O(e−2L), whereas φ2
to be independent of L) is shown to be zero when evaluated at L
. The norm
of the j = 1 state can also be recovered in this manner, though one needs a better
approximation for D+ in this case; a way to obtain these better approximations is given
below.

The matrix elements are likewise regulated, provided we know the logarithmic
derivatives D±(ω) when the wavefunction is integrated from x
. These are
not available for a general potential. Another way to regulate the matrix elements is to
integrate along a contour in complex x plane, e.g., along the path x = ueiθ, u real and
θ ﬁxed. The matrix element becomes

It is easily seen that φ2
0(ueiθ) decays exponentially for suﬃciently large θ and hence
the integral along the rotated contour converges [13]. As an example, we compute the
matrix element numerically for j = 1 state using (4.15) with θ = 60◦. The result agrees
with the analytic value given by (4.11). In the case of P-T potential, the logarithmic
derivatives D±(ω) are available analytically. Hence the matrix element can also be
evaluated by (2.15), but since this result is highly special, we shall not exhibit it here.
Instead, we go on to a numerical scheme applicable to all potentials with exponential
tails.

4.4. Numerical evaluation and Born series

−

For any system, provided the unperturbed wavefunction φ0(x) is known, the shifts
are in principle given by (2.15) and (2.16). These involve (a) ﬁnite integrals from
L− =
L to L+ = L, which can be handled numerically in the usual way; and (b)
surface contributions involving D±. The latter contain all the information from the tails
of the potential. The lowest approximation D±(ω)
iω is in general not accurate
enough, because it multiplies φ2

A general, yet simple way to obtain a better approximation for

the Born approximation. Here V will stand for any potential; by applying the method
sketched below, we can ﬁnd the logarithmic derivative of either V0 or V0 + V1, and hence
e−αx and the Born approximation is carried to
obtain the quantities D±. If V (x)

We have implemented this scheme for the P-T potential, indeed for any potential

In this example, we have summed four terms with α = 2/b = 2, and consequently the
remaining error in the logarithmic derivative calculated is O(e−10x). Incidentally, this
method, when evaluated at x = L, gives accurate expression for D+(ω) as needed in
Section 4.3.

We have used this method to evaluate both the matrix element (2.15) and the norm
(2.16), taking L+ = L = 5. (In this example, only the positive half line is needed due to
the symmetry of the potential.) To be precise, the integral over the ﬁnite domain (0, L)
is evaluated numerically, while the surface term is evaluated by the Born series (4.20).
The result for ω1 agrees accurately with the result obtained from the two methods
sketched earlier.

However, there is still a numerical problem. Take the norm in the j = 1 state as an

example. Numerical evaluation gives for the two terms in (2.15)

so that there is a loss of 6 signiﬁcant digits when the two terms are combined. The cause

of the problem, as before, is the exponential growth of the wavefunction φ0(x)

(A2/2iω0) e2iω0L,
so that the asymptotic L dependence of the two terms are respectively
where A = 1/2iω0 for the wavefunction φ0(x) normalized as in (4.9). A related diﬃculty

±

17

is that the integrand is large and oscillating, which limits the accuracy of evaluating the
integral. However, these diﬃculties are readily remedied if we subtract A2e2iω0x from the
integrand, and add the corresponding term (A2/2iω0) (e2iω0L
1) to the surface term.
Then in this example one ﬁnds

modiﬁed surface term = 22.5541253

29.4010213i ,

−

−

and there is only a loss of 2 signiﬁcant digits when the two terms are combined. This
technique can be further reﬁned by removing subasymptotic terms as well. This method
does not rely on any property of the P-T potential other than the exponential tails.

The numerical diﬃculty associated with the exponential growth of the QNM
wavefunction is exactly the same as the diﬃculty in the “shooting” algorithm discussed
in Section 1.2. This same diﬃculty, in diﬀerent guises, always besets numerical solutions
of QNM problems. Here we have developed an eﬀective method within the realm of
perturbation theory — but otherwise applicable to any system with exponential tails —
to tame the problem. The class of problems with exponential tails is suﬃciently wide
for this method to be of interest, especially since there is a dearth of other eﬀective
methods. With this numerical technique to handle exponential tails, LPT is completely
formulated for potentials either without tails, or with exponential tails.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we have formulated LPT for QNMs. For systems without tails, the
formalism is no more complicated than for NMs. In fact, there are several advantages:
the absence of nodes allows simple application to all states, not just the ground state,
and the possibility that QNMs may not be complete makes alternative methods (e.g.,
generalization of RSPT) less useful. The explicit form of the ﬁrst-order shift is given,
as well as the most general form of the second-order shift for an arbitrary perturbation.
When there is a tail that can be expressed as a sum of exponentials, a method is
developed, based on the Born series, that reduces the calculation to the evaluation of
integrals, the exponentially large nature of which can be handled by subtracting oﬀ the
leading asymptotic terms. While this is somewhat involved, it is to be stressed that for
this case no other methods apply in general, not even brute-force numerical integration,
on account of the need to extract an exponentially small “wrong” solution. Thus the
technique is likely to be useful. Indeed, this technique has already been employed to
deal with model perturbation of a black hole [30].

Finally, the generalized norm plays a central role, and in fact has a signiﬁcance

is to write these open systems in terms of a non-hermitian Hamiltonian [25, 26] and

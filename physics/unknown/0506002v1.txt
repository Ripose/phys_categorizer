Abstract. 

Within the framework of Extended Space Model (ESM) the processes connected to birth 
of photons in a gravitational field are studied. These photons have a nonzero mass. It can be both 
positive, and negative, and photon's energy and strength of the gravitational field determine its 
absolute value. 

It is shown that in ESM model formation of bubble gravitational structures is possible. In 
the frame of ESM one can obtain the follow physical picture.  Bubble gravitational objects have a 
halo formed by dark matter generated by photons with a positive mass. The photons with a 
negative mass are throw away in free deep space and create there antigravitating vacuum with 
negative pressure. 

The comparison ESM bubble structures with similar objects of a type "gravastar", existing 

in a General Theory of Relativity (GR) is made. 
 

Introduction. 

In paper [1] within the framework of Extended Space Model (ESM), developed by the 

authors [2,3], the gravitational effects, such as a red shift, deflection of light, radar echo and 
perihelion precession of Mercury were considered. It was shown that the ESM predictions for 
values of these effects as a first approximation coincide with predictions of General Theory of 
Relativity (GR). 

During last years astronomers detect new phenomena, which are not described in 
traditional point of view on universe structure based on GR. Essences of these phenomena are 
reduced to following statements [4,5,6,7,8]. 
1) The main part of Universe mass (more than 0.9) makes dark matter and dark energy, which 
associate with space vacuum. 
2) This dark substance does not emit electromagnetic radiation and does not interact with him, 
but shows gravitational properties. 
3) The space vacuum has negative pressure, or, in other words, shows properties of an 
antigravitation, which determines dynamics of Universe extension. 

In present work we develop an approach to explanation of above-mentioned phenomena 

based on ESM. This model is a generalization of Einstein theory of relativity at (1+4)-
dimensional space, where the 5-th coordinate is the interval. 
Movement along additional 5-th coordinate corresponds to changing of particles rest-mass. 

This is the case when a photon, get into an exterior field, gains a nonzero mass. Moreover, 
this mass can have both positive and negative sign. Pair of photons which born in an exterior field 
consists from one photon with positive mass, and the other one has negative mass. According to 
ESM the dark matter is formed by massive photons. The photons with a positive mass are 
concentrated around massive stars and black holes. Such photons create their halo. The photons 
with negative mass are throw in free deep space and create there antigravitating vacuum with 
negative pressure. Therefore, from our point of view, the dark matter consists mainly of photons 
with a positive mass, and the dark energy is generated by photons with a negative mass. 

 

Various modes that propose exist of nonzero photon mass are discussed in review [9]. Let 
us mark also that the possibility of existence of body with a negative mass was considered and in 
GR [10]. 

Recently attention is attracted with a new gravitational model, so-called "gravastar", or 

gravitational condensed star [11]. This object was offered as alternative to black holes. Such 
object corresponds to the solution of the Einstein equation, which outside of area occupied by 
masses, coincides with Schwarzchild solution. Inside of gravastar there is other, nonsingular 
solution, so that metric is as a whole received nonsingular. 

Gravastar has a structure similar to a structure of a bubble. This bubble has a dense rigid 
envelope, which is under tension because of liquid substance, pressed apart it from within. Just 
with the help of such model, some authors try now to explain a nature of some observable objects 
in space. 

In the present work we will show, that in the frameworks of ESM it is possible result 
when from a bunch of homogeneous substance will be generated the structure possessing a denser 
shell and the less dense center part. For this purpose we attribute to gravitation field some index 
of refraction  n
nonzero photon mass. In [12,13] there were considered different possibilities of attribution some 
refractive indexes to gravitational field. 

. This index of refraction cause diminishing photon velocity and origination

Photons in gravitational field. 

Energy of a particle in a central field consists of two parts: potential and kinetic. In the 

present work we use a nonrelativistic approximation, as we are interested possibility of formation 
of a dark matter, and the relativistic corrections are important only for exact quantitative 
calculations. 

Let us consider the process, in which a photon is created in some interaction of 

elementary particles, for example as a result of annihilation. Generally speaking in such reactions 
several photons are usually created, but we shall consider all these photons separately. We 
assume that photons are created free, massless, and only then, appearing in an external field gain 
a mass. 

In frameworks of ESM a 5-vector [2]

corresponds to a free photon.  

 

                                 

(1) 

The influence on it from external fields are described by rotations in extended space 

G(1,4). Type of a rotation and its value are determined by strength of the field and by that 
process, in which the particle participates, i.e. which one of the particle components varies: an 
energy, pulse, or mass. In this case, we consider the process, in which the energy of a particle 
does not vary, and only the reorganization of its interior structure happens, in particular, it's mass 
changed. Such rotation is described by a rotation in the plane (XS). This rotation has a form

The rotation at angle  ψ  is determined by strength of an exterior field. Turn value and, 

accordingly, the parameters of a massive photon are set by the place, in which this photon is born.

The formula (9) gives a maximum value of a radius, for which, created particles are not 

kept any more by gravitational field. 
     This result was obtained in the supposition, that all mass M is concentrated in a center, or else, 
that the particle is dot. Let's consider the case when gravitating object (star) M has the form of a 
full-sphere with a radius R and its mass M is distributed in it with a homogeneous denseness ρ .   

Let us consider a situation when a photon is created in a point at a distance r from a star

For the gravitational object had area, inside which photons created would be trapped, two

One can see from the above mentioned data that in case of stars such as the Sun and white 

dwarf the condition (13) is defaulted. For neutron stars of a type (1) conditions (13) are carried 
out and the condition (14) is on a limit of realization, as for such objects their physical radius R 
approximately coincides with gravitational 

. However, as the gravitational radius was found for 

gr

a mass concentrated in one point, and the mass of a neutron star is distributed inside of the star 
radius, thus the gravitational radius of neutron star should have a smaller value. Thus, we found 
that the neutron stars of type (1) can be referred to number of objects for which the conditions 
(13) and (14) are fulfilled. 

The approximately same arguments, but with large stipulations, it is possible to take into 
account in case of neutron stars of a type (2) and gravastar of all two types. In all these objects, 
can be a shaping of a bubble structure. For purpose of better understanding this process, we will 
study gravastar structure.

in dependence from what area they were born in, or remain in a neighborhood of gravitational 
object and will create its halo from dark matter, or depart from it. The photons with negative

In the case of defined conditions in central area of object, for r < rmin it is possible photons 

trapping with negative mass and form space, in which is satisfied condition (21). 

On Figures 3-6 the graphs of variables w(r), h(r) are reduced, where the distance r is 
measured in units of radius r1 . Value of the radius r2 is not fixed. Graphs forms are hardly depend 
from the  initial conditions. It is visible, that in the case of appropriate choice of these initial 
conditions such relation between mass M and sizes r1, r2 is possible to supply in such a way that 
they become close to mass M and radiuses rmin, rmax of objects considered in the previous section. 
The solution of the equations (17), represented on Fig.3 corresponds to case, when in a central 
part gravastar the area of de Sitter space is formed, as it is represented on Fig.1 with r1> 0.

the area II can be counted directly from zero (r1 = 0 ) and in gravastar central part will not origin 
areas of the de Sitter space. 

Question concerning with what kind of these possibilities will be realized in case of 

concrete physical objects, requires additional study. 
 

Discussion. 

Thus, in ESM frameworks there is a mechanism, according to which in a neighborhood of 
massive gravitational objects the halo consisting of photons with positive masses can be formed. 
These halos we associate with a dark matter. The photons with negative masses are concentrated 
far from massive objects. These photons will create areas of a dark energy. 

Such areas are characterized by negative pressure and exhibits properties of 

antigravitation. This area calls the accelerated extension of that visible part of the universe, which 
consists of a positive matter.

Also is shown, that the bubbles shaping structures of gravastar type it is possible. More 
exact reviewing of this process requires the analysis of the dynamic equations and will be made 
later. It is necessary also to compare these models to a model of gravitational bubbles {15}.

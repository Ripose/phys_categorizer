We report the direct observation of periodic intensity modulation of a laser
pulse propagating in a hollow core waveguide. A series of equally spaced
plasma sparks along the gas-ﬁlled capillary is produced. This eﬀect can be
explained by the beating of diﬀerent ﬁber modes, which are excited by con-
trolling the size of the focal spot at the capillary entrance. As compared to an
artiﬁcial modulated waveguide structure, our presented approach represents
an easier and more ﬂexible quasi-phase-matching scheme for nonlinear-optical
frequency conversion.

Introduction

Intensity-modulating laser light along its propagation path has important consequences for
nonlinear optics. Very recently, progress on quasi-phase matching of high-harmonic gener-
ation (HHG) has been achieved by using periodic intensity variation of a laser pulse prop-
agating along a modulated hollow-core waveguide.1, 2, 3 There are many more examples in
nonlinear optics where quasi-phase matching can be employed to yield higher nonlinear-
optical conversion eﬃciencies.4, 5 In another ﬁeld of research, the problem of dephasing in
laser-wakeﬁeld acceleration6, 7 can also be addressed by employing a suitably modulated laser
pulse intensity. It enables the accelerated electron bunches to ‘rephase’ with the plasma wake
at those positions where it is less intense and to be in phase for acceleration at the positions
where the wake ﬁeld is strongest.

1

A technical solution to create a periodic intensity variation is the modulated waveguide,1, 2
which provides a ﬁxed modulation period for the intensity of the laser pulse. For both
applications mentioned above however, an adjustable periodicity of the modulation would be
favorable in order to optimize the processes. Quasi-phase matching could then be achieved
for a selectable soft-x-ray photon energy in the HHG case and eﬃcient matching to the
electron kinetic energy for laser-wakeﬁeld acceleration could be achieved.

In this paper, we present and experimentally demonstrate a way of modulating the in-
tensity along a waveguide without employing a modulated waveguide. The basic idea is the
excitation of more than one (hollow) ﬁber mode at the entrance of the waveguide. Since
diﬀerent ﬁber modes possess diﬀerent longitudinal wavevectors, the superposition of two or
more leads to a characteristic beating behavior of the intensity along the propagation axis.
In essence, the modulated waveguide can be regarded as a ﬁber-mode ﬁlter, which can be
replaced by direct selective initial (at the entrance of the ﬁber) excitation of the suitable
ﬁber modes. As we will show, it is very easy to excite a superposition of the two lowest-order
modes in order to produce an intensity modulation just by choosing the appropriate size of
the focus at the entrance of the ﬁber. In the future, tailoring the spatial phase of the laser
prior to focusing8 allows a straightforward way to excite an arbitrary superposition of ﬁber
modes, leading to an adjustable period of the on-axis intensity modulation. Our approach
even allows its implementation in plasma waveguides,9 which can be used to increase the
acceleration length for electrons in laser-wakeﬁeld acceleration.

2. Mechanism

As has been calculated by Marcatili and Schmeltzer,10 for λ (cid:28) a (λ: wavelength, a: inner
radius of the hollow waveguide with refractive index of the cladding ν) the hollow ﬁber modes
in cylindrical coordinates can be approximately written as

Ernm = Jn

1(unm

) cos(nθ) exp (i(γz − ωt)) ,

Eθnm = Jn

with k = 2π/λ being the free-space propagation constant, unm the mth root of the Bessel

function of the ﬁrst kind Jn
describes the attenuation of light propagating in a hollow ﬁber whereas its real part is the lon-
gitudinal wave-vector kz. Diﬀerent ﬁber modes thus have diﬀerent longitudinal wave-vectors.

If we now consider a superposition of diﬀerent modes, a beating along the propagation axis
(z-axis) will occur. The transverse intensity distribution of the beam traveling along the
capillary will continuously change. In particular, if we consider only two modes being ex-
cited, the transverse intensity pattern will reappear with a given periodicity ∆z along the
propagation axis:

∆z =

2π
∆kz

,

(3)

with ∆kz denoting the longitudinal wave-vector diﬀerence of the two ﬁber modes under
consideration. The radial intensity distributions of the two lowest order modes EH11 and
EH12 are plotted in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the radial intensity distributions I(r) = |E11(r) ±
f E12(r)|2 for the additive (+) and subtractive (−) interference case, respectively. Although
the mixing ratio of higher to lower order mode is only 1:25 (in terms of total power content)
(f =0.2) for this example, the two distributions are strikingly diﬀerent. In the case of additive
interference the beam is conﬁned to a small region very close to the axis, which results in an
increased on-axis intensity. For the subtractive interference, which occurs at an axial position
∆z/2 away, the beam power is more evenly distributed, decreasing the on-axis intensity. A
ringlike intensity distribution is obtained instead. This example illustrates the possibility to
create a periodic intensity distribution along the propagation axis without manipulation of
the structural properties (diameter) of the waveguide.

How can we excite two ﬁber modes in an eﬀective manner? As has been found by Abrams,11
the optimal focus size for which coupling from a gaussian beam into the lowest order (EH11)
ﬁber mode is most eﬃcient is given by

w = 0.64 a,

(4)

where w the 1/e2 intensity radius of the beam. At this beam diameter, 98% of the incoming
laser beam power is coupled into the EH11 mode. If the beam size is chosen diﬀerently from
that value, higher order modes are excited. For our case of hollow waveguides, where the
refractive index of the ﬁber cladding is higher than that of the core, higher order modes
generally suﬀer signiﬁcantly higher losses.10 This is the reason why in most experiments
aiming at maximum overall laser throughput, this scenario is tried to be avoided. In Fig. 2
we plot the amount of power or pulse energy coupled into the two lowest-order radially
symmetric ﬁber modes from an input gaussian beam with given w. A maximum of 98% at
the value given in Eq. (4) is obtained for the EH11 mode. Most eﬃcient coupling into the
EH12 mode occurs at a relative waist size of w/a = 0.26, with roughly 20% eﬃciency. The
ﬁnding that we excite the EH12 mode eﬀectively for smaller gaussian beams becomes clear
by regarding the additive interference case shown in Fig. 1. Due to on-axis constructive and
oﬀ-axis destructive interference, the intensity distribution closely resembles a gaussian with
a w/a of ∼ 0.5 which is smaller than the optimal one needed for eﬃcient coupling into EH11.

3. Experimental results

For the experimental demonstration, the hollow ﬁber was located inside a vacuum chamber,
which was back-ﬁlled with 1 bar argon gas. Alignment to the laser was done by means of
a 3-axis translation stage, enabling translation of the position of the focus in three dimen-
sions, without changing the angle between propagation direction and ﬁber axis. The ﬁber was
aligned angularly with respect to the beam by tilting the ﬁber mount. An 0.3 m plano-convex
lens was used to focus onto the entrance of the ﬁber. The f-number was measured to be 14,
resulting in a focal radius w = 12 µm. With the ﬁber inner radius a = 25.5 µm, we obtain
a ratio of w/a = 0.5. Our laser is a commercial Ti:sapphire system from Spectra Physics,
delivering pulses of 1 mJ energy, 10 ns pulse duration, 800 nm central wavelength at a 1 kHz
repetition rate. A charge-coupled device (CCD) camera behind an 800 nm band-block ﬁlter
acquired a photographic image of the capillary, which is shown in Fig. 3. A series of light
emission centers (sparks) periodically lines up along the capillary axis. Since the fundamental
radiation of the laser was blocked, the emission is attributed to plasma recombination light.
Plasma generation in argon at wavelengths of 800 nm and pulse durations of several ns pro-
ceeds via an initial multiphoton (seed) process aided by collisional (avalanche) ionization.12
The process is thus nonlinearly dependent on intensity, acting as a local intensity probe.
We can therefore state that we could directly observe a periodic modulation of intensity
along the propagation direction of the laser light. This observation has only experimentally
been reported for planar waveguides and low intensity levels so far, where the modulation
was detected with a near ﬁeld probe.13 The separation of the plasma maxima (i.e. the beat-
ing period) in our experiments ∆z is ∼2.7 mm, which is in good agreement with Eq. (3)
considering excitation of EH11 and EH12 for the given ﬁber radius.

4. Simulation and Discussion

To give further evidence, we performed a computer simulation of the propagation of light in
a hollow gas-ﬁlled glass capillary similar to the one reported in14 for diﬀerent parameters.
The ﬁber dimensions were reduced to a diameter of 3.4 µm and the laser pulse duration
reduced to 10 fs in order to keep the computation time at an acceptable level while still
being able to obtain a qualitative comparison. In our model, we numerically integrated
Maxwell’s equation with a discrete diﬀerences approach on a two-dimensional cartesian grid.
The ionization rate was calculated15 at each time step and the number of newly produced
electrons per unit volume was added to the corresponding local free-electron density. The
important ratio of initial beam waist to ﬁber radius was chosen to be w/a = 44% and thus
close to the experimental parameters. The result for the free-electron density produced from
the laser pulse is shown in Fig. 4.

Again we obtain a periodic modulation of plasma density along the capillary axis. The

4

smaller beating period of ∼65 µm can be understood from the reduced dimensions of the
ﬁber. The expected beating period obtained from Eq. 3 for the population of the two lowest
order ﬁber modes for the simulated geometry is 57 µm which is in agreement with the
numeric result, conﬁrming the validity of the mechanism. In addition to the on-axis plasma
modulation, an oﬀ-axis modulation is visible, which exhibits secondary maxima at axial
positions half-way in between the on-axis maxima. This can be attributed to the ringlike
intensity distribution for the case of subtractive ﬁber-mode interference (Fig. 1). The eﬀect
of plasma defocusing on the observed behavior has been studied by varying the intensity
of the pulses in the simulation and the inﬂuence on the periodicity of the phenomenon was
negligible.

We would now like to discuss the relevance of ﬁber mode interference for quasi-phase-
matching schemes. For any kind of nonlinear frequency conversion application, the eﬃciency
of the process is governed by the phase mismatch

where the kn represent the contributing wave-vectors in the process. For the quasi-phase-
matching case, we have to realize a modulation of the coupling between the fundamental and
converted frequencies which is periodic along the generation path. This way, the conversion
process into the signal ﬁeld will occur only when the interference between propagating signal
and newly generated signal is constructive. The period length ∆z can be converted into an
eﬀective wave-vector ∆keﬀ = 2π/∆z. Quasi-phase matching is achieved when

∆kpm =

kn,

Xn

∆kpm = m∆keﬀ

(5)

(6)

with the order of quasi-phase matching m being an integer number. Above we showed that
ﬁber mode interference can directly create periodic intensity modulations which are charac-
terized by an eﬀective wavevector ∆keﬀ = ∆kz (see Eq. (3)). Therefore excitation of two (or
more) ﬁber modes can be directly exploited for quasi-phase matching applications.

5. Conclusion

In conclusion we experimentally showed that excitation of more than one ﬁber mode leads
to a periodic modulation of the radial intensity distribution of a laser beam propagating
inside a hollow core ﬁber. We demonstrated this eﬀect experimentally by creating a series of
equally spaced laser induced plasma sparks along the ﬁber axis. This ﬁnding has important
implications for quasi-phase-matching applications and schemes for laser-wakeﬁeld accelera-
tion. We would ﬁnally like to point out that our considerations are not restricted to hollow
capillaries but certainly apply to any kind of guided geometry.

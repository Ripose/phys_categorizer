Summary. − In Dirac’s fine-structure formula for the hydrogenlike atoms a critical role is 

played  by  the  square  root  of  the  following  expression:    the  unity  minus  the  square  of  the 

product of the atomic number by the fine-structure constant (which is approximately equal 

to 1/137). Indeed, for a fictitious, ideal nucleus for which the above product is greater than  

or equal to one, the mentioned square root becomes imaginary, or zero. I prove in this Note 

that  the  origin  of  such  theoretical  “breaking  down”  is  quite  simple  and  is  inherent  in  the 

special theory of relativity of classical physics.

1. − The problem 

As  is  well  known,  Dirac’s  fine-structure  formula  for  the  energy  of  an 

electron in the Coulomb field generated by a fixed nuclear charge Ze is as follows:

[1]. (Remark that Dirac writes  j in lieu of  κ , but Dirac’s j  does not coincide with 

the inner quantum number, which is usually denoted with  j . For the customary  j

).  Weyl  [1]  emphasizes  that  the  number  of  components 

corresponding  to  the  fine-structure  formula  (1.1)  is  greater  than  in  Sommerfeld’s 

theory  [2]:  indeed,  in  addition  to  the  transitions

may  also  have

,  eq.  (1.1)  loses  obviously  any  physical  meaning.  What’s  the 

significance  (if  any)  of  this  “failure”?  (Remark  that  in  Schrödinger  nonrelativistic 

theory there is no limitation of this kind). 

In  the  past  half-century  many  physicists  have  tried  to  find  a  reasonable 

answer,  but  with  a  scarce  success.  One  of  them  “resolved”  the  difficulty  by 

requiring all eigenfunctions to approach the origin of the coordinate system with the 

same  constant  phase,  arbitrarily  chosen.  In  this  way  he  created  a  series  of 

eigenvalues free from the above limitation. However, the overwhelming majority of 

the  authors  followed  the  line  of  thought  proposed,  e.g.,  by  Bjorken  and  Drell  [4], 

who  remarked  that  “for 

1≥αZ

, 

1(

− Z

2

α

)

  is  imaginary  [or  zero]  and  the 

solutions  [of  Dirac  equation]  exhibit  an  oscillatory  behavior  reminiscent  of  that 

found in the Klein paradox.” [5]. This observation suggests that the explanation of 

the  riddle  ought  to  be  sought  in  the  positron  theory  of  quantum  electrodynamics. 

Nevertheless, no convincing answer has been found from this viewpoint − and pour 

cause, as we shall see. 

 

I prove in the sequel that the problem can be solved in a plain and rational 

way,  the  root  of  the  enigma  being  inherent  in  the  special  theory  of  relativity.

2. − The solution 

The energies E of the discrete levels of a relativistic one-particle system are 

restricted  to  the  domain  between 

2

0cm−

and 

2

0cm+

,  whereas  for  the  energies  of 

the  scattering  states  we  have 

E +≥

0cm

2

or 

E −≤

0cm

2

.  Of  course,  from  the 

physical  standpoint  we  select  for  the  bound  states  the  energies E between  0   and 

2

0cm+

, and for the scattering states the energies  E such that 

E +≥

0cm

2

, see e.g. 

Dirac [1]. 

In 1932 Pauli applied the WKB-method to Dirac equation [6], and showed 

that:  i)  the  diffraction  effects  of  the  electron  waves  and  the  spin  actions  have  the 

same order of magnitude, thus confirming an important thesis by Bohr; ii) the rays 

of the “geometrical optics”, which follows from the “wave optics” corresponding to 

Dirac equation, coincide with the trajectories of the classical relativistic dynamics of 

point particles without spin. (This theorem can be further corroborated by means of 

the mathematical theory of the characteristics). 

Pauli’s results assign a precise significance to the fine-structure formula for 

the  hydrogenlike  atoms  discovered  by  Sommerfeld  in  1916  [2]:  by  means  of 

Sommerfeld-Wilson  conditions,  this  Author  selected  a  discrete  subset  of  the 

classical relativistic orbits 

0(

<

0cmE <

2

)

for a point electron without spin. We can 

say that Sommerfeld’s formula gives just the right Bohr-Sommerfeld approximation 

to  Dirac’s  fine-structure  formula,  which  concerns  an  electron  with  spin  (a  spin 

generated by the Zitterbewegung). 

Let us write Sommerfeld’s formula:

κ=ϕn

:  this

difference  between  the  azimuthal  quantum  number 

ϕn   and  the  auxiliary  quantum 

number κ  must be ascribed to the spin influence: indeed, the values of κ  represent 

the eigenvalues of the following operator  D (see Dirac [1]), which is a constant of 

the motion:

and 

3ρ is  a  well-known  operator  of  Clifford-Dirac  algebra.  (Our D  coincides with 

Dirac’s operator j ). 

Equation  (2.1)  tells  us  that  when 

1≥αZ

  we  encounter  the  same 

interpretative  difficulty  of  equation  (1.1):  this  is  not  a  trivial  remark,  because  it 

allows us to exclude any connection with the Klein paradox and the positron theory: 

we are confronted here with an essentially classical, i.e. non-quantal, difficulty. This 

can be seen in the clearest and explicit way with the following considerations. 

First of all, we observe that it is easy to write the classical analogue of (2.1): 

 

 

it is sufficient to perform the following substitutions:

3. − Conclusion 

We have seen that the relativistic non-quantal formula (2.4) holds only for angular 

momenta p greater  than 

Ze /2

c

.  Quite  similarly,  the  relativistic  Sommerfeld’s 

formula  (2.1)  holds  only  for  azimuthal  quantum  numbers 

ϕn   greater  than  αZ . 

Now, Dirac’s formula (1.1) represents a refinement of Sommerfeld’s result (2.1), i.e. 

a  better  description  of  physical  reality.  Accordingly,  it  is  quite  reasonable  that 

Dirac’s formula too is subjected to an  analogous limitation: the absolute values of 

the auxiliary quantum number  κ must always be greater than  αZ . 

 

The origin of all the above restrictions is unique: it is a “fault” of the special 

theory of relativity of classical physics.

A similarity theory is developed for ultra-relativistic laser-plasmas.
It is shown that the most
fundamental S−similarity is valid for both under- and overdense plasmas. Optimal scalings for
laser wake ﬁeld electron acceleration are obtained heuristically. The strong message of the present
work is that the bubble acceleration regime [see Pukhov, Meyer-ter-Vehn, Appl. Phys. B, 74, 355
(2002)] satisﬁes these optimal scalings.

The concept of laser-plasma electron acceleration has
the decisive advantage over conventional accelerators:
plasma supports electric ﬁelds orders of magnitude higher
than the breakdown-limited ﬁeld in radio-frequency cav-
ities of conventional linacs. It is expected that the rela-
tivistic laser-plasma will ﬁnally lead to a compact high
energy accelerator [1]. The very ﬁrst experiments already
have delivered high quality electron beams in the energy
range 70...170 MeV [2–4]. Yet the way to a real laser-
plasma accelerator that generates a high-energy electron
beam with parameters required by practical applications
is long and full of problems which have to be solved.
The main obstacle is that the experiments depend on too
many parameters. Often, this makes the interpretation of
experimental results ambiguous. At the same time, theo-
retical models suﬀer from the similar drawback. The sys-
tem of kinetic equations describing the problem is both
strongly non-linear and contains many parameters. As a
result, the quest of searching for new perspective accel-
eration regimes is challenging and the physics of electron
acceleration in plasma is often rather obscure.

The scientiﬁc diﬃculties just listed are neither new nor
unique. Quite analogous problems encounters the classi-
cal (magneto-)hydrodynamics. One of the most powerful
theoretical tools in such situation is the similarity theory
[5, 6]. The similarity allows engineers to scale the behav-
ior of a physical system from a laboratory acceptable size
to the size of practical use.

To the best of our knowledge, no similarity theory
has been applied to relativistic laser plasma interactions.
This situation is surprising and unnatural, because the
power of similarity theory for the magnetic conﬁnement
was recognized in the late 70s and the similarity theory
[7] has been in use for design of large devices (tokamaks,
stellarators) ever thereafter [8].

For the ﬁrst time, we develop a similarity theory for
laser-plasma interactions in the ultra-relativistic limit.
Using a fully kinetic approach we show that the similar-
ity parameter S = ne/a0nc exists, where a0 = eA0/mec2
is the relativistically normalized laser amplitude, ne is
the plasma electron density and nc = meω2
0/4πe2 is the
critical density for a laser with the frequency ω0. The

basic ultra-relativistic similarity states that laser-plasma
interactions with diﬀerent a0 and ne/nc are similar as
soon as the parameter S = ne/a0nc = const.

ested in the special limit S
1 of relativistically un-
derdense plasmas as it is important for the high energy
electron acceleration. In this case, S can be considered
as a small parameter and quite general scalings for laser-
plasma interactions can be found.
It follows from the
theory that in the optimal conﬁguration the laser pulse

responds to the “Bubble” acceleration regime [9].

The central result of our work is that the bubble regime
satisﬁes the optimal wake ﬁeld acceleration scalings. The

factors are taken from 3D PIC simulations.

We suppose that the laser pulse vector potential at the
time t = 0 short before entering the plasma is A(t = 0) =
a
cos (k0x), where k0 = ω0/c is the
wavenumber, R is the focal spot radius and τ is the pulse
duration. If one ﬁxes the laser envelope a(r⊥, x), then
the laser-plasma dynamics depends on four dimensionless

similarity means that the number of truly independent
dimensionless parameters decreases, i.e., one of the pa-
rameters S, k0R, or Π can be expressed as a function of
the remaining two. We choose S and Π as the indepen-
dent parameters:

L0(Π)) depend on the only dimensionless parameter Π.
In this notations, N is the number of trapped electrons
and L is the acceleration length.

It follows from the Maxwell equations that the maxi-
mum possible accelerating wake ﬁeld scales as Ewake ∝
neR. It corresponds to complete electron expulsion by
the laser pulse ponderomotive pressure. This ﬁeld accel-
erates electrons to the energy

the powers αi. This is not unexpected, because we have
used the energy relations only and did not discuss details
of the acceleration mechanism. Although, the equation
(19) is remarkable.
It relates the two lengths, R and
L. One can introduce the fundamental similarity length

It follows from the bubble physics [9, 12], that if the
aspect ratio Π < 1, the laser pulse ﬁts into the cavity. In
this case, it is reasonable to expect that the eﬃciencies
κ0, θ0, η0 weakly depend on Π. For simplicity, we neglect
this weak dependence. Then, the last three equations
in (18) claim that the dependence of N0 on Π is also
weak. At the same time, γ0(Π) is simply propotional to
Π. Summarising, we write

the laser pulses are depleted, the acceleration ceases and
the wave breaks.

evolve quite similarly. Several common features can be

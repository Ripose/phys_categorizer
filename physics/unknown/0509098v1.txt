Abstract

To  describe  the  nonequilibrium  states  of  a  system  we  introduce  a  new  thermodynamic
parameter - the lifetime (the first passage time) of a system. The statistical distributions that can
be  obtained  out  of  the  mesoscopic  description  characterizing  the  behaviour  of  a  system  by
specifying  the  stochastic  processes  are  written.  Superstatistics,  introduced  in  [1]  as  fluctuating
quantities  of  intensive  thermodynamical  parameters,  are  obtained  from  statistical  distribution
with  lifetime  (random  time  to  system  degeneracy)  as  thermodynamical  parameter  (and  also
generalization  of  superstatistics).  Necessary  for  this  realization  condition  with  expression  for
average lifetime of stationary statistical system obtained from stochastical storage model [32] is
consisting.  The  obtained  distribution  passes  in  Gibbs  distribution  depending  on  a  measure  of
deviation from equilibrium related to fluxes and dissipativity in the system.

In  works  [1,  2]  the  generalization  of  Boltzmann  factor  exp{-β0E}  was  introduced  in  the

dβ`f(β`)exp{-β`E}.                                                                                       (1)

It is supposed there that the intensive parameter (return temperature β, chemical potential, etc.)
fluctuates.  These  fluctuations  evolve  on  a  long  time  scale.  Locally,  in  some  spatial  area  (cell)
where β is approximately constant, the system is described by usual Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics
with  ordinary  Boltzmann  factor  exp{-βE}  where  E  is  the  energy  a  microstate  associated  with
each  cell.  On  a  long  time  scale  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  fluctuations  of  β.
Superposition of two statistics (that of β and that of exp{-βE}) which therefore and refers to as
"superstatistics"  is  derived.  This  formalism  is  successfully  applied  to  the  description  of  fully
developed hydrodynamic turbulence, defect motion in convection states, the statistics of cosmic
rays  and  other  metastable  and  nonequilibrium  phenomena.  The  special  case  of  these
superstatistics,  at  function  f,  reduces  to  gamma-distribution,  appears  in  the  nonextensive
statistical  mechanics  [3,  4],  describing  a  number  of  the  physical  phenomena  which  are  not
satisfactory  described  by  Boltzmann-Gibbs  statistics  (for  example,  long-range  many  body
systems, systems with memory, many phenomena in nuclear physics, astrophysics, geophysics,
ecology and other complex systems). In the present work the superstatistics as (1) (together with
its  generalization)  is  obtained  starting  from  nonequilibrium  thermodynamics  which  as  a
thermodynamic variable contains a first-passage time, lifetime of statistical system [5, 6, 7, 8],
Section 2.

It  is  mean  explaining  what  is  understood  under  the  notion  of  a  first-passage  time  or
lifetime.  Arbitrary  systems  are  formed  from  elements,  particles,  or  elementary  objects.  These
elements enter any system and leave it. It is possible to formulate the notion of a lifetime with
mathematical strictness; one thus understands the time period at which the elements are present
in a system. For example, if we consider a small volume cell of a gas, its lifetime is the period till
all  molecules  occasionally  leave  this  cell.  Are  examples  borrowed  from  chemical  kinetics  are
times at which the number of molecules of certain kind becomes zero, time of the dissociation of
a  two-atom  molecule,  the  age  of  a  (biological)  system,  residence  times  of  grains  in  sand-pile
models etc.

Stratonovich  in  [9]  used  the  term    “lifetime”  as  terminus  techniques  with  respect  to  the
number of phenomena considered. Following synonyms are encountered by us: the first passage
time (for some given level), escape time, busy period (in the queuing theory) etc. First published
paper  on  the  subject  is  [10]  where  the  Pontryagin  equations  for  the  lifetime  distribution  are
obtained. In 1940 the Kramers work  [11] appeared which dealed with the escape time from the
potential well. These questions are discussed in books by van Kampen [12], Gardiner [13] and
other authors [14]. The lifetime plays part in the theory of phase transitions, chemical reactions,
in investigating dynamics of the complex biomolecules, calculating the coefficient of the surface
diffusion  in  semiconductors,  in  nuclei,  elementary  particles,  spin  glasses,  spectroscopy,  trap
systems, in the theory of metastable states etc.

The  lifetime  is  the  time  period  till  the  moment  of  the  first  (random)  reattachment  of  a
certain level (for example, zero level) by a random process y(t)  for  the  macroscopic  parameter
(2) (for example, energy or particle number). The lifetime is the slave process in the terminology
of  the  random  processes  theory;  that  of  y(t)  (Fig.1)  determines  the  behaviour  of    lifetime.  The
lifetime  depends  on  the  energy  of  a  system,  its  size,  fluxes  of  energy.  Therefore  a  system
exchanges with thermostat the energy, the particle number, but not the “lifetime”. The lifetime Γ

2

is a macroparameter characterizing the system and its interaction with the environment. It is an
observable,  well-defined  and  physically  well  understandable  quantity  reflecting  important
system peculiarities.

We  don’t  consider  the  current  time,  but  rather  the  lifetime  of  a  specific  system,  its  age
determined by the evolution of the system. Vice versa: the properties of a system depend on its
age (such as for a human, evidently, the age is of prominent importance). In the thermodynamics
and statistical physics it is supposed that statistical systems tend to the state of equilibrium. We
consider  open  systems  for  which  the  equilibrium  state  is  vague  concept.  But  each  and  every
physical system possesses finite lifetime, the latter being thus a universal physical characeristics.
We  don’t  consider  the  idealised  systems  of  infinite  size,  which  is  we  don’t  perform  the
thermodynamic transition, as in [15,16]. Many systems degenerate without reaching equilibrium.
Therefore lifetime seems to be more representative value than the equilibrium reaching time. In
[4,5,6] the conception of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics with lifetime as a thermodynamic
parameter is derived.

In  [17]  it  is  pointed  that  a  nonequilibrium  distribution  is  characterized  by  an  additional
macroparameter  in  the  description.  One  can  show  [18]  that  in  the  method  of  nonequilibrium
statistical operator (NSO) [19, 20] this parameter is the time t-t0, from the birth of a system, that
is  this  is  the  first-passage  time  of  the  zero  level  if  we  inverse  time,  the  age  of  the  system  (in
Zubarev work [19] the NSO is obtained by averaging over the initial time; in [21] it is noted that
the ε value from NSO in [19, 20] is inversely proportional to the lifetime). In works of Kirkwood
[22] it was noted that the state of a system at the current time depends on the whole evolution
history of the nonequilibrium processes in it, thus, on its age as well. Therefore we choose the
random  lifetime  as  an  additional  thermodynamical  parameter.  In  [18]  an  analogy  is  outlined
between  the  approaches  of  Prigogine  [23]  and  that  of  Zubarev  [19,  20]  -  the  latter  approach
considers the dynamics of a system and correlations from the whole past of a system.

When  considering  the  finite  size  systems  the  finiteness  of  lifetime  seems  to  be  essential.
Normally functioning system appears to be in a steady nonequilibrium state characterized by a
given deviation from equilibrium and the entropy production. Each state of a system has its own
lifetime  related  to  fluxes  magnitudes  and  sources  strengths  and  therefore  its  deviation  from
equilibrium.  The  influences  experienced  by  a  system  interacting  with  environment  lead  to  the
deviation  from  the  normal  stable  state  and  to  the  dissipative  effects,  they  equally  change  the
degree  of  deviation  from  the  stationary  state,  entropy  and  lifetime.  Raising  lifetime  Γ    to  the
realm of the macroscopic observables reflects possible complication of the structure of the phase
space that can contain domains of different behaviour (for example, attractors with anomalously
big lifetimes etc). From the random processes theory it follows that the existence and finiteness
of a lifetime is provided by the existence of stationary states, physically meaning the existence of
stationary structures.

One considers an open system, and dynamical characteristics under the interaction with the
surrounding turn to be random; thus the macrodescription only is possible. The structure of phase
space generally has complicated (fractal) shape, conditioned by the noncontinuous character of
the underlying stochastic process. The lifetime is macroscopic value; one does not need explicit
dependence of the lifetime on the phase space variables. Likewise in the approach based on the
maximum  entropy  principle  [24]  one  doesn’t  need  the  knowledge  of  the  details  of  the
microscopic  behaviour.  Therefore  one  introduces  lifetime  as  a  phenomenological  macroscopic
value. It is not a dynamical value (although it depends on the phase space coordinates), but it is a
statistical  value  described  by  well-known  equations  for  the  density  of  its  distribution  function
(for example, the Pontryagin equations [10]).

The  open 

systems  are  characterized  by  energy  and  entropy 

redistribution,
nonhomogeneous character of the time flow. The events in the system history are conditioned by
the  entropy  and  information  fluxes  from  inside  and  from  outside.  For  example,  we  determine
from the breath whether a human is alive. In the theory of random processes there is a key notion

3

where from it is possible to derive the whole theory, that is the notion of the stop moments, and
the lifetime is a particular kind of them. The events bearing the information on a system create
the time flux in it; the moments of birth and death stay apart. Since we consider open systems
which exchange the dynamical quantities with surrounding the introduction of the lifetime as a
principal  random  value  is  believed  to  be  an  important  and  necessary  element  of  correct
description of nonequilibrium phenomena.

It  is  worth  noting  that  the  notion  of  lifetime  has  many  interpretations,  and  its  physical
applications are also various. For example, the relaxation times can be considered as lifetimes of
the excited states. An analogy can be traced between the approach of the present work and the
description of nonergodicity in the spin glasses [25] (although the “lifetime” term was not used
there),  which  included  the  memory  effects  (dependence  on  the  previous  history  of  a  system),
dependence on the initial time moment, and on the times of transition between different valleys
on the energy profile. This problem is related to the response functions in systems with excited
degrees  of  freedom  [26].  In  our  work  we  presented  the  lifetime,  likewise  it  was  done  in  the
pioneering  work  [10],  from  the  outset  in  a  strict  mathematical  form  (2),  similarly  to  the  same
value  introduced  in  the  theory  of  random  processes.  One  can  admit  various  physical
interpretations of the general mathematical description. One of these possibilities applied in this
work  to  the  lifetime  of  the  system  in  the  energetic  valleys,  leads  to  the  obtained  class  of
statistical distributions containing the product of Gibbs-like factor and that of superstatistics.

In  [27]  it  is  noted  that  the  q-exponential  pdf’s  represent  a  special  case,  which  in  turn
includes the Boltzmann-Gibbs pdf’s as an even more special one, corresponding to the standard
thermal equilibrium. It seems natural to believe that realistic physical systems combine both the
properties  of  Gibbs  systems  and  those  of  nonextensive  statistical  mechanics.  Therefore  the
investigation  of  suggested  distribution  seems  to  be  prospective,  which  is  confirmed  by  the
existence of such kind of distributions for a number of various phenomena. It schould be noticed
that in this formalism the distribution is obtained in the first place.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we consider the statistical distribution with
lifetime [4-6]. In Section 3 the examples of unperturbed equilibrium and stationary distributions
for  lifetime  are  considered;  they  enter  the  expression  for  the  generalized  structure  ω(Е,Γ)
(number  of  states  with  given  macroparameters).  In  Section  4  we  make  assumptions  as  to  the
shape of ω(Е,Γ). As in self-organized criticality (SOC) [28] it is essential that the system have
many metastable states. SOC a finite-size-scaling hypothesis is successfully tested. The statistical
distribution  is  obtained  which  represents  a  product  of  a  Boltzman-Gibbs  factor,  and  the
superstatistic factor. The weight of each factor depends on the deviation from equilibrium and on
the fluxes magnitude. The examples of application of the lifetime concept and use of expressions
with a lifetime for various concrete physical problems are resulted in Section 5. We finish with a
discussion and summary in Section 6.

2. System lifetime and lifetime distribution

In the present work we consider open nonequilibrium systems, stationary nonequilibrium
systems, certain point metastable states. Work on spin glasses and other aging systems, where a
"waiting time" plays an important role, points in this direction.

Characterizing the nonequilibrium state by means of an additional parameter related to the
deviation of a system from the equilibrium (field of gravity, electric field for dielectrics etc) was
used in [17]. In the present paper we suggest a new choice of such an additional parameter as the
lifetime of a physical system which is defined as a first-passage time till the random process y(t)
describing  the  behaviour  of  the  macroscopic  parameter  of  a  system  (energy,  for  example)
reaches  its  zero  value  (Fig.1).  The  lifetime  Γx  (or  Γ)  is  thus  a  random  process  which  is

4

subordinate (in terms of the definitions of the theory of random processes [29]) with respect to
the master process y(t),

Γx=inf{t: y(t)=0},  y(0)=x>0 .                                                                                    (2)

This definition of  the lifetime is taken from the theory of random processes where it is widely
used  in  the  theory  of  queues,  stochastic  theory  of  storage  [48].  There  it  is  possible  to  find
numerous examples of his application. The characteristics of Γ depend on those of y(t). We use
below as y(t) the value of full energy of the system E, assuming her nonnegativity though it is
possible to consider as y(t) and (or) the number of particles in the system. For example, for an
rarefied  gas  flowing  through  a  pipe  y(t)  is  the  number  of  particles  of  gas  in  the  pipe,  and  Γ  is
time during which in a pipe there are particles of gas.

It is important to make clear a physical interpretation to the definition (2). So, the lifetime
is  related  to  the  period  of  stable  existence  of  a  system,  its  time  of  dwelling  within  the
homeokinetic  plateau  whose  distribution  was  related  in  [30]  to  the  entropic  and  information
parameters  of  a  system,  its  response  to  internal  and  external  influences,  its  stability  and
adaptation facilities. The states of a system within the homeokinetic plateau are characterized by
the  mutual  compensation  of  the  entropic  effects  related  to  the  energy  dissipation  and  by  the
effects  of  negative  entropy  determined  by  the  existence  of  the  negative  feedbacks.  When  the
system exits out of the limits of the plateau unstable structures and sharp qualitative changes in
the  behaviour  of  the  system  arise.  We  assume  that  the  existence  and  the  magnitude  of  finite
lifetime are related to the deviation of the system from the equilibrium.

In  the  works  on  statistical  physics  similar  definitions  of  thermodynamic  values  are
encountered.  For  example,  in  [31]:  "Any  function  B(z)  of  dynamic  variables  (z=q1,…,qN,
p1,…,pN),  having  macroscopical  character,  by  definition  is  random  internal  thermodynamic
parameter".  In  [17]  all  values  dependent  on  z  concern  are  treated  in  this  way.  The  fact  that  a
lifetime (2) Γ(z) is the function of z, is obvious from the equations for distribution of a lifetime in
Markov  model  [10],  which  are  related  to  the  equation  the  z-dependent  density  of  distribution.
Pontryagin equations for density of probability of a lifetime are conjugated to the equations such
as  the  Fokker-Planck  equations  for  density  of  probability  of  energy  (which  depends  from  z).
Evidently it is visible from a situation when one considers as system some volume with gas in
which  all  molecules  are  located  on  its  borders  with  the  velocities  directed  outwards.  Then  a
lifetime is finite. For other configuration of coordinates and pulses a lifetime will be another. The
lifetime  values  are  influenced  by  the  attractors,  metastable  states,  phase  transitions  and  other
physical peculiarities of a system which depend on z. The same is clear from the consideration of
the examples of: a) stochastic storage model in which the lifetime is proportional to the statistical
sum  [32];  b)  the  mean  lifetime  of  a  neutron  subsystem  after  integration  over  velocities  and
coordinates [18]; c) the sedimentation times for aerosols [33]. Besides that the lifetime shows the
dependence  on  the  energy  E  as  well  as  particle  number  N  which  are  likewise  z-dependent.
Therefore we consider the lifetime to be a thermodynamic parameter.

To validate the choice of lifetime as thermodynamic value one can reassert to the method
of Zubarev NSO [19, 20] which is interpreted in [18] as averaging of quasiequilibrium (relevant)
the statistical operator on distribution of lifetime of the system pq(y). Then at pq(y)=εexp{-εy} (in
[18] a more general choice, merely arbitrary one, of the function pq(y) is suggested)

lnρ(t)= ∫

pq(y)lnρq(t-y,-y)dy=lnρq(t,0)- ∫

exp{-εy}(dlnρq(t-y,-y)/dy)dy ,                (3)

where  ρ  is  nonequilibrium  statistical  operator,  ρq  is  relevant  statistical  operator  [19,  20].  The
entropy  production  operator  [19,  20]  is  equal  σ(t-u,  -u)=dlnρq(t-u,  -u)/du.  If  σ(t-u,  -u)≈σ(t)  or

5

σ(t-u,-u)≈<σ(t)>  has  weak  u-dependence  then  equality  (3)  acquires  a  form  lnρ(t)=lnρq(t,0)+
<σ(t)>ε-1=lnρq(t,0)+<σ(t)><Γ>, as in interpretation [18] ε-1= <Γ>=<t-t0> is average lifetime.
We  shall  note,  that  such  distribution  is  received  in  [34].  Then  a  relation  (3)  in  nonequilibrium
thermodynamics with lifetime as thermodynamical parameter is replaced with expressions (5) -
(6), or, in more general form, lnρ(t)=lnρq(t,0)+ln[Z(β)/Z(β,γ)]-γΓ, where ρ=exp{-βE-γΓ}/Z(β,γ),
ρq=exp{-βE}/Z(β),  Z(β)=∫exp{-βE}dz  (in  (5)  instead  of  <Γ><σ(t)>  stand  the  random  value  Γ
and Lagrange multiplier γ in: γΓ+lnZ(β,γ)/Z(β)). That is, averaging on distribution of lifetime in
Zubarev  NSO  is  replaced  with  use  of  a  random  variable  of  lifetime,  -  there  lays  essential
difference of distribution (5) - (6) from (3) and from results of works [19, 20, 34].

The  value  Γx  in  (2)  it  is  time  before  degeneration,  destruction  of  the  system.  From  the
theory of the random processes it follows that existence and finiteness of the lifetime Γ value is
related  to  the  presence  of  stationary  states,  which  physically  corresponds  to  the  existence  of
stationary structures. Complex functional and hierarchical relations of real systems correspond to
the  analogous  between  lifetimes  determining  evolutionary  processes  as  sequence  of  transitions
between  various  classes  of  the  system  states.  In  contrast  to  the  traditional  representation  about
time  as  about  something  changeable,  lifetime  acts  as  result  of  existence  of  stable  stationary
structures. It depends on external influences on system and from internal interactions in it.

In termostatics it is supposed that any isolated thermodynamic system eventually reaches
an equilibrium state and never spontaneously leaves it. However the assumption of a possibility
of  fluctuations  in  system  (i.e.  random  deviations  of  internal  parameters  from  their  equilibrium
values)  contradicts  main  principles  termostatics.  We  shall  replace  the  assumption  of  a  system
remaining in the basic (equilibrium) state for an infinite long time at its isolation from influence
of  environment  with  a  more  physical  assumption  (corresponding  also  to  the  statistical
description) about an opportunity of a system leaving this state and destruction, degeneration of
the system under influence of internal fluctuations.

The  distribution  for  lifetime  Γ  (2)  generally  depends  on  macroscopical  value  y(t)  of  the
master  process  that  governed  by  Γ,  the  master  random  process  describing  some  relevant
macroparameter  (energy  or  particle  number)  (Fig.1).  Let  us  suppose  that  the  process  y(t)=E  is
the  energy  of  a  system  (equivalently  one  could  choose  the  particle  number,  pulse  etc).  Gibbs
equilibrium distribution for microcanonic probability density in phase space z corresponds to a
condition  of  equiprobability  of  all  possible  microstates  compatible  with  the  given  value  of  a
macrovariable. We shall assume, that transition of system in a nonequilibrium condition breaks
equality  of  probabilities,  characteristically  for  an  equilibrium  case.  One  introduces  additional
observable  macroparameter,  thus  extending  the  phase  space  (containing  additional  degenerate,
absorbing states). We shall assume validity of a principle of equal probabilities for the extended
phase space divided into cells with constant values (E, Γ) (instead of phase cells with constant
values E). The standard procedure (e.g. [35]) allows one to write down the relation between the
distribution density p(E,Γ)=pEΓ(x,y) and microscopic (coarse-grained) density ρ(z;E,Γ)

p(E, Γ)=∫δ (E-E(z))δ (Γ-Γ(z))ρ(z; E, Γ)dz=ρ(z;E, Γ)ω(E, Γ).                                   (4)

The structure factor ω(E) is thus replaced by ω(E,Γ) - the volume of the hyperspace containing
given  values  of  E  and  Γ.  If  µ(E,Γ)  is  the  number  of  states  in  the  phase  space  which  have  the
values  of  E  and  Γ  less  than  given  numbers,  then  ω(E,Γ)=d2µ(E,Γ)/dEdΓ.  It  is  evident  that
∫ω(E,Γ=y)dy=ω(E). The number of phase points between E,E+dE; Γ,Γ+dΓ equals ω(E,Γ)dEdΓ.
We make use now of the principle of equiprobability applied to the extended cells (E,Γ).

Using  a  maximum-entropy  principle  [24],  it  is  possible  to  write  down  expression  for

microscopic (but coarse-grained) density of probability in the extended phase space

6

ρ(z; E, Γ)=exp{-βE-γΓ}/Z(β,γ) ,                                                                                 (5)

where

Z(β,γ)=∫exp{-βE-γΓ}dz=∫∫dEdΓω(E,Γ)exp{-βE-γΓ}                                                  (6)

is  the  partition  function,  β  and  γ  are  Lagrange  multipliers  satisfying  the  equations  for  the
averages

<E>=-∂ lnZ/∂ β|γ ;                  <Γ>=-∂ lnZ/∂ γ|β .                                                     (7)

Introducing Γ means effective account for more information than merely in linear terms of
the  canonical  distribution  exp{-βE}/Z(β).  The  distribution  (5)  with  the  lifetime  contains  two
different time scales: the first relates to the energy E, and the second – to the lifetime itself Γ,
this latter one accounts for large-scale time correlations and large-time changes in E by means of
a thermodynamically conjugate to the lifetime γ. The similar operation can be derived from NSO.
The value γ thermodynamically conjugated to the lifetime is related to the entropy fluxes
and  entropy  production  which  characterize  the  peculiarities  of  the  nonequilibrium  processes  in
an open thermodynamic system. If γ=0 and β=β0=(kBTeq)-1, where kB is the Boltzmann constant,
Teq    is  the  equilibrium  temperature,  then  the  expressions  (5-6)  yield  the  equilibrium  Gibbs
distribution. One can thus consider (5-6) as a generalization of the Gibbs statistics to cover the
nonequilibrium  situation.  Such  physical  phenomena  as  the  metastability,  phase  transitions,
stationary  nonequilibrium  states  are  known  to  violate  the  equiprobability  of  the  phase  space
points.  The  value  γ  can  be  regarded  as  a  measure  of  the  deviation  from  the  equiprobability
hypothesis.  In  general  one  might  choose  the  value  Γ  as  a  subprocess  of  some  other  kind  as
chosen above. The canonical Gibbs distribution is derived from the microcanonical ensemble as
zeroth approximation on the interaction between the system and the environment The lifetime Γ
allows effective account of this interaction   (analogously to the methods of McLennan [36] and
that  of  Zubarev  NSO  [19]).  The  value  of  γ=0  characterizes  equilibrium  isolated  systems,
presenting thus an idealisation. If the detailed balance is satisfied and in equilibrium γ≠0.

For the method exposed formally the relation of the Γ  value (slave process) to the master
process  E  is  essential.  However  the  lifetime  concept  bears  also  a  more  profound  physical
meaning,  unifying  the  Newtonian  approach  to  the  absolute  time  and  the  ideas  of  the  time
generating  matter.  The  lifetime  parameter  bears  features  adherent  to  both  ordinary  dynamical
variables (energy, particle number) and coordinate variables (time). Mathematically introducing
lifetime  means  acquiring  additional  information  regarding  an  underlying  stochastic  process,
beyond merely knowledge of its stationary distribution, exploring the (stationary) properties of
its  slave  process.  The  irreversibility  appears  there  as  a  consequence  of  the  assumption  that
lifetime exists and is finite, and the moments of birth and death of a system are observable and
physically essential.

Let us underline the principal features of the suggested approach.

1. We introduce a novel variable Γ which can be used to derive additional information about a
system  in  the  stationary  nonequilibrium  state.  We  suppose  that  Γ  is  a  measurable  quantity  at
macroscopic  level, thus values like entropy which are related to  the  order  parameter  (principal
macroscopic variable) can be defined. At the mesoscopic level the variable Γ is introduced as a
variable  with  operational  characteristics  of  a  random  process  slave  with  respect  to  the  process
describing the order parameter.
2. We suppose that thermodynamic forces γ related to the novel variable can be defined. One can
introduce the “equations of state” β(<E>,<Γ>), γ(<E>,<Γ>). Thus we introduce the mapping
(at least approximate) of the external restrictions on the point in the plane β, γ.

3.  We  suppose  that  a  “refined”  structure  factor  ω(E,Γ)  can  be  introduced  which  satisfies  the
condition ∫ω(E,Γ=y)dy=ω(E) (ordinary structure factor). This function (like ω(E)) is the internal
(inherent)  property  of  a  system.  At  the  mesoscopic  level  we  can  ascribe  to  this  function  some
inherent to the system (at given restrictions (β0,γ0)) random process. The structure factor has the
meaning  of  the  joint  probability  density  for  the  values  E,Γ  understood  as  the  stationary
distribution of this  process. Provided the  “reper”  random  process  for  the  point (β0,γ0),  one  can
derive therefrom the shape of the structure function. If we model the dependence of the system
potential of the order parameter by some potential well, the lifetime distribution within one busy
period and probabilities ω(E,Γ) can be viewed as distributions of the transition times between the
subset of the phase space (possibly of the fractal character) corresponding to the potential well,
and  the  subset  corresponding  to  the  domain  between  the  “zero”  and  the  “hill”  of  the  potential
where from the system will roll down to the zero state. To determine the explicit form of Г (at
(β0,γ0)) the algorithm of the asymptotic phase coarsening of complex system is used (Section 3).
4.  It  is  supposed  that  at  least  for  certain  classes  of  influences the  resulting  distribution  has  the
form  (5),  (6),  that  is  the  change  of  the  principal  random  process  belongs  to  some  class  of  the
invariance leading to this distribution which explains how one can pass from the process in the
reper  point  (β0,γ0)  (for  example,  in  equilibrium  when  γ=0  and  β=1/kBТ)  to  a  system  in  an
arbitrary nonequilibrium stationary state. The thermodynamic forces should be chosen so that the
distribution lead to new (measurable) values of (<E>,<Γ>).

3. Distribution for indisturbed lifetime

The  use  of  a  specific  lifetime  distribution  depends  on  the  physical  peculiarities  of  the
system under investigation. For simple system with a single class of ergodic states (for example,
definite  volume  cell  with  gas),  the  limiting  exponential  distribution  is  valid,  which  has  been
proved in works of Stratonovich [9], and on the level of pure  mathematics –  by Korolyuk and
Turbin [37] et al. Such distribution is widely used in the theory of reliability and other sciences.
By  means  of  the  exponential  distribution  the  authors  of  [5-7]  described  the  thermal  and  mass
conduction, and  chemical  reactions.  However complex  systems  with  several  classes  of  ergodic
states  and  complicated  structure  of  the  state  space  (in  general  it  can  acquire  fractal  shape)  are
characterized  by  so-called  homeokinetic  plateau,  whose  lifetime  distribution  can  be  of  various
forms.  In  [18]  it  is  suggested  for  the  NSO  method  to  use  instead  of  exponential  the  gamma-
distributions, as well as other functions accounting for physics of the systems.

Further  detailed  elaboration  will  require  the  concrete  definition  of  the  Γ  distribution  and
the interpretation of the Lagrange parameters β and γ. The Lagrange parameter β is supposed to
be (likewise the equilibrium Gibbs statistics)

β=1/kBT,                                                                                                                     (8)

where T is the average (over the body volume) local equilibrium temperature. Since at fluxes  qr ≠
0 the temperature is not the same all over the bulk of the body, one can define T in a system with
volume V as the volume average, i.e. T=V-1
∫ T(r,t)dr (the same definition was used in [35]). Of

V

coarse, the thermodynamic description itself is supposed to be already coarse-grained. To get the
explicit form of the Γ distribution we shall use the general results of the mathematical theory of
phase coarsening of the complex systems [37], which imply the following density of distribution
of the lifetime for coarsened random process (see also [9]):

p(Γ<y)=Γ0

-1exp{-y/Γ0}                                                                                               (9)

in the case of several (n) classes of the ergodic stable states, Rk – probability that the system is in
the  k–th  class.  The  values  Γ0  and  Γ0i  are  averaging  of  the  residence  times  and  the  degeneracy
probabilities  over  stationary  ergodic  distributions  (in  our  case  -  Gibbs  distributions).  The
physical reason  for the realization of  the  distribution  in  the  form (9-10)  is  the  existence  of  the
weak ergodicity in a system. Mixing the system states at big times will lead to the distributions
(9-10). As we note in Section 2, the structure factor ω(E,Γ) has a meaning of the joint probability
density of values E,Γ. For the distributions (9), (10) the functions ω(E,Γ) from (4), (6) take on
the form:

ω(E,Γ)=ω(E)Γ0

-1exp{-Γ/Γ0};      ω(E,Γ)=ω(E)

Z(β,γ)=Z(β)(1+γΓ0)-1 ;     Z(β,γ)=Z(β)

R1=(Γ20-Γ10Γ20b)/(Γ20-Γ10); 

We have from (6)-(7) and (11)-(12) when Γγ=-∂ lnZ(β,γ)/∂ γ|β;  Γ0(V)=Γγ(V)|γ=0;

Γγ=Γ0 /(1+γΓ0),               γ=1/Γγ -1/Γ0 ,                                                                     (13)

that is γ is the difference between the inverse lifetimes of the open system 1/Γγ and the system
without external influences 1/Γ0 which can degenerate only because of its internal fluctuations.
The  value  γ  is  thus  responsible  for  describing  the  interaction  with  the  environment  and  its
existence is the consequence of the open character of a system. When defining γ one should take
into  account  all  factors,  which  contribute  to  the  interaction  between  the  system  and  the
environment. If one denotes in (13) x=γΓ0, then x=x1+x2+...+xn, where the value xi is determined
by the flux labelled by the index i. From expressions (3) and (5) - (6) it is visible, that the value γ
is  connected  to  the  entropy  production  σ.  From  comparison  with  the  Extended  Irreversible
Thermodynamics  [38]  it  is  possible  to  show  that  x=γΓ0≈qat0a/aR,  where  qa  are  characteristic
currents in the system, a is density of values a which is transferred by a currents qa, R is the size
of the system, t0a is time of degeneration of the system, time for which the system will pass with
homeokinetic plateau in a degeneration state. Time t0a is expressed through times of a relaxation
of currents τq (for example, for neutron system in a nuclear reactor with a current of neutrons Φ,
τΦ=1/vnΣtr, where vn is average speed of neutrons, Σtr is transport section) and Onzager’s factors
Lq.  For  example,  for  the  case  of  chemical  reactions  accompanied  by  diffusion  t0k=t0k  diff  =сkR

Let's note that the value similar to γ it is defined in  [39-41] for fractal objects. It is equal to

parameters, and λKS is Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.

In last equality (16) it is supposed, that there exists n classes of ergodic states in a system; 

kR  is
the probability of that the system will be in k-th a class of ergodic states, 
 is density of
distribution of lifetime Γ in this class of ergodic states (generally fk depends from E). As physical
example  of  such  situation  (characteristic  for  metals,  glasses)  one  can  mention  the  potential  of
many  complex  systems  of  a  kind,  for  example,  Fig.  2.  Such  situation  is  considered  in  [42].
Minima  of  potential  correspond  to  the  metastable  phases,  disproportionate  structures,  etc.
Essential object of research of statistical physics recently became complex nonergodic systems:
the spin and structural glasses, disorder geteropolimery,  the  granular  media,  transport  currents,
etc. [43]. The basic feature of such systems will be, that their phase space is divided into isolated
areas, each of which corresponds to a metastable thermodynamic state, and the number of these
areas exponential exceeds full number (quasi)particles [44]. The quasithermodynamical theory of
structural  transformations  of  alloy  Pd-Ta-H,  based  on  this  model,  is  constructed  in  [45].
Expression (16) to the description of such systems is applicable.

systems  of  small  volume  or  with  small  lifetime,  with  the  big  currents  qa  and  big  values  t0a,  at

homeokinetic  plateau  in  a  degeneration  state  (Section  3).    At  such  an  approach  which  can  be
considered as a discretized version of superstatistics [1, 2], one accounts for not only the inverse
temperature fluctuations (that of β), but the fluctuations of values  P, v, α as well.

then  (21)  acquires  the  form  p(E)∼exp{-βE-β0r0E}=exp{-β0E},  where  the  open  character  of  the
system (existence of fluxes) is taken into account, therefore the inverse temperature is set to be
not β=1/kT, but β0. Thus the relation between β and β0 is β=β0(1-r0); β0=β/(1-r0).

case is

p(E)∼exp{-βE}[1+(q-1)(1-exp{-β0r0E})]-1/(q-1).                                                         (23)

The  same  result  can  be  written  for  the  Polia  distribution  characterized  by  the  characteristic
function  ϕ(t)=[1+αλ(1-exp{it})]-1/α  at α=q-1, λ=1. In this approach the  behaviour of p(E) is
asymptotically  not  power-like,  as  in  Tsallis  [3,  4]  distributions,  but  rather  exponential.  The
argument  β0r0E  in  the  Tsallis  distribution  ([3,  4],  see  also  the  part  II)  is  replaced  by  (1-exp{-
β0r0E}). To find an asymptotics at big values of the argument by exp{-β0r0E}<<1, lets develop
into series the second factor in the rhs of (23):

p(E)∼exp{-βE}[1+exp{-β0r0E}/q+exp{-2β0r0E}/2q+(2q-1)exp{-3β0r0E}/6q2+…].

As  Rk  one  can  choose  various  specific  forms  of  distributions.  The  negative  binominal
distribution  can  be  considered  as  a  distribution  of  a  random  value  with  Poisson  distribution,
whose parameter µ is itself a random value distributed via the gamma-law with the parameters

12

λ=p/(1-p), α=r [46]. Poisson distribution at independent trials describes the trapping by the k-th
potential well. Real trapping by the k-th well is affected by many factors which is reflected in the
random  character  of  the  parameter  µ.  One  more  way  of  arriving  at  the  negative  binominal
distribution  [46]  is  considering  the  fact  that  it  is  the  particular  case  of  the  generalized  Poisson
distribution. It describes the sum SN=X1+…+XN of the random number N of independent random
Xi, described by the characteristic function f(t), the random number N being Poisson distributed
with  the  parameter  λ.  If  for  f(t)  one  chooses  the  characteristic  function  of  the  logarithmic
distribution  [46]  of  the  kind  f(t)=ln[1-(1-p)exp{it}]/lnp,  from  the  general  expression  for  the
characteristic  function  of  the  generalized  Poisson  distribution  ϕ(t)=exp{-λ+λf(t)}  taking  r=-
λ/lnp,  we  get  the  characteristic  function  [p/(1-(1-p)exp{it})]r  of  the  negative  binominal
distribution.  If  for  the  generalized  Poisson  distribution  we  choose  as  f(t)  the  characteristic
function of the negative binominal distribution with the above defined parameters, we get for the
distribution function (22)-(23):

p(E)∼exp{-βE-λ+λf(exp{-β0r0E})}∼exp{-βE-λ+λ[1+(q-1)(1-exp{-β0r0E})]-1/(q-1)}.     (24)

We  define  the  λ  parameter,  likewise  it  was  done  above,  λ=-rlnp=ln[1+(q-1)]/(q-1).  Thereby
<βkrk>≠β0r0; <βkrk>=λβ0r0. One can obtain the equality <βkrk>=β0r0 choosing the parameter p
of  the  characteristic  function  of  the  negative  binominal  distribution  (24)  as  p=(1+(q-1)/λ)-1=
(1+(q-1)2/lnq)-1 (the last equality corresponds to our choice of the λ parameter). Thus instead of
(24) we have:

p(E)∼exp{-βE-λ+λ[1+(q-1)2(1-exp{-β0r0E})/lnq]-1/(q-1)}.

Other values of λ can be equally used. In this framework the system falling into the k-th valley is
described by a random sum Xi of the clusters of the valley [42, 45]. The number of valleys in a
single cluster is distributed over the negative binominal distribution with r=1/(q-1), p=1/[1+(q-
1)]. At q→1 the distribution (24) passes to p(E)∼exp{-βE-1+exp{-(1-exp{-β0r0E})}}.

In the absence of fluxes and r0→0 we get the Gibbs distribution p(E)∼exp{-βE}. The same
distribution  can  be  obtained  from  (23)  at  r0→0.  If  we  expand  (24)  over  λ,  then  p(E)∼exp{-
βE}[1+λ([1+(q-1)(1-exp{-β0r0E})]-1/(q-1)-1)+λ2[1+(q-1)(1-exp{-β0r0E})]-1/(q-1)-1)2/2+…],  which
presents Gibbs distribution and its amendments.

One more possibility of obtaining more detalized distributions lies in the use of compound
characteristic functions, when one of the functions serves as argument for another: ϕ(f(t)). The
probabilistic  interpretation  of  such  relation  is  that  they  correspond  to  the  SN=X1+…+XN  of
random  number  N  of  independent  random  values  Xi.  Physically  they  describe  hierarchical
systems; such hierarchical fractal structure of potential profiles plays important part in realistic
complex systems [42, 45]. One can use several levels of hierarchy: ϕ(f1(f2(…))). The use ϕ(f(t))
of the negative binominal distribution and expressions like (23) ϕ and f leads to the p(E) of the
kind

5. Examples of application of expressions (5), (14) with a lifetime

As  concerning  a  simple  example  of  the  stationary  nonequilibrium  state  described  by
distributions (5) - (7), (14) - (16), we shall consider a flow of rarefied gas in a tube of radius R
and lengths L, L>>R. In this system there is one class of ergodic states. If in expression (15) to
choose structure factor ω(E,Γ) as (9), (11) we obtain:

13

  p(E)=exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z(1+γΓ0).                                                                                 (25)

From  (13)  we  find,  that  1/(1+γΓ0)=<Γ>/Γ0,  where  <Γ>  is  average  a  lifetime  of  the
system.  Now  for  the  determination  of  <Γ>  we  apply  the  stochastic  model  of  storage  with
constant exit rate r=af(1-χZ(t)) which has been used in work [32] (Appendix A).

in 

the 

random 

input  of  elements 

The  random  rate  of  change  of  number  of  elements  Z  in  this  model  is  described  by  the
stochastic equation dZ/dt=dAf/dt-af(1-χZ(t)), where χZ(t)=0, Z(t)>0;   χZ(t)=1, Z(t)=0; dAf/dt is rate
system,  PZ0(0,t)=E{χZ(t)}=P{Z(t)=0|Z(0)=Z0};
of 
P0=limt→∞PZ0(0,t) is the stationary probability of degeneration. As in (A.3), Appendix A, there
act the stationary external forces v supporting difference of pressure on the ends of the tube, and
in their role enter the walls of a tube reflecting particles of rarefied gas, collisions between which
we neglect. We get from (A.3) that <Γ>=<xf>tf/af(1-ρf/af), where <xf>=∫xbf(x)dx is average size
of  the  input  “batches”,  bf(x)  is  density  of  distribution  of  size  the  input  “batches”;  ρf=ρ-f,
ρ=λ<x>, λ is intensity of an inputing flux, -f = <Iv> is the average flux connected to enclosed
force v. Then

1/(1+γΓ0)=(<xf>tf/afΓ0)/(1-ρf/af).                                                                              (26)

The  multiplier  <xf>tf/afΓ0  is  included  in  normalizing  multiplier  Z.  It  is  possible  to  show  that
stationary  value  of  a  flux  q  in  this  system  is  equal  to  ρf,  as  q=af(1-P0)=ρf,  P0=1-ρf/af.  For
rarefied  gas  the  flux  in  a  tube  is  q=2R(m/2kBT)1/2(P1-P2)/3πL  [49],  where  (P1-P2)  is  the
difference  of  pressure  on  the  ends  of  a  tube,  m  is  weight  of  atoms,  T  is  temperature.  This
expression for a flux is obtained from Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and can be considered as
taken in zero order. Average value of internal energy, thermodynamic internal energy U for ideal
gas it is U=CVT, where CV is a thermal capacity of system at constant volume [49]. We assume a
constancy  of  temperature  in  a  tube  equal  to  temperature  of  walls.  The  pressure  is    P=nkBT/m,
where n is density of gas; then q=ρf=2R(1/2m)1/2(n1-n2)(kBU/CV)1/2/3πL. If in this expression and
in (26) we replace average value of a flux q with microscopic value of a flux having put in q,
U=E,  where  E  is  microscopic  random  internal  energy  (this  can  be  done  since  real  flux  and
energy in system are random variables), from (25) - (26)  the distribution for energy becomes

p(E)=exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z[1-q(E)/af]=

exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z[1-2R(1/2m)1/2(n1-n2)(kBE/CV)1/2/3πLaf].                        (27)

At ρf≥af in system there are no stationary states and stationary distributions. Value af=const can
be defined as the maximal value of a flux, at which  there exist stationary states in laminar mode.

If  due  to  fluctuations  of  energy  Е=

value of velocity) or of density n1, n2, value of a random flux q will exceed the value af, there
arise arises a turbulent mode in a system, new structures for which a new stationary distribution
is  formed.  Value  q=af  is  a  point  of  nonequilibrium  phase  transition  from  a  laminar  mode  to
turbulent.

The obtained distribution (27) can be written and in the other form if if we multiply and
divide  by  value  q(Е)=2R(1/2m)1/2(n1-n2)(kBE/CV)1/2/3πL  on  density  in  the  middle  of  a  tube
n(L/2)=<n(E)>=∫n(E)p(E)dE  and    assume  that  n(L/2)≈n(E)=p(E)n0,  n0=∫n(E)dE.  Performing
this for n(L/2) in numerator  we get a quadratic equation for p(E) with the solution p(E)=[1+(1-
(qn0/afn(L/2))4exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z)1/2]/2(qn0/afn(L/2)).  The  minus  sign  is  chosen  because  at  q→0,
p(E)→exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z, as in (27). At q/af≥1 expression under radical can take negative values,
and  as  in  (27),  the  stationary  mode  does  not  exist.  However,  in  this  case  the  condition  of
breaking the stationarity is expressed not so precisely, as in (27). Decomposing square root into

βE}ω(E)/Z)2(qn0/afn(L/2))2+…]. Putting n(L/2)≈n(E)=p(E)n0 in a denominator of expression for
q  in  (27)  yields  p(E)=exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z+q(E)n(L/2)/afn0.  At  n(L/2)/n0≈exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z  the
expression for p(E) is p(E)≈(exp{-βE}ω(E)/Z)[1+q(E)/af]; this expression can be considered as
the  first  member  of  decomposition  (27)  at  small  values    q/af,  and  does  not  take  into  account
phase transition, when q/af→1.

As one more example we shall consider system of neutrons in a nuclear reactor (NR) and
we  shall  obtain  distribution  of  energy  of  neutrons  in  a  nuclear  reactor  in  view  of  finiteness  of
their  lifetime.  All  characteristics  of  a  nuclear  reactor  are averaged  on  distribution  of  energy  of
neutrons in a reactor (or on a flux of neutrons depending on energy), therefore obtaining these
distributions  is  important.  Among  known  approximations  are  Maxwell  distribution  for  thermal
neutrons  and  Fermi's  distribution  for  fast  neutrons,  and  intermediate  neutrons  are  described  by
various  approximations.  In  the  present  section  a  uniform  distribution  for  all  energy  range  is
obtained.  In    [50]  it  is  marked  that  the  equilibrium  condition  of  neutrons  with  nucleus  of
moderator  can  not  be  reached  because  of  finiteness  of  lifetime  of  neutrons.  For  neutrons  with
energy above energy of thermal group the spectrum differs from Maxwell one.

As classes of ergodic states are considered prompt neutrons (a zero class) and n groups of
the delayed neutrons which are emitted by corresponding precursors, fission fragment isotopes.

At k=1 there are no stationary distributions and stationary states. This situation can be modeled

6. Conclusion

From the distribution (5) containing lifetime of statistical system (first-passage time, time
before degeneration of system) we obtained the energy distributions of a system which contain
the  product  of  the  Gibbs  factor  and  a  factor  corresponding  to  the  superstatistics  which  was
introduced in [1] merely formally (though in [1] the dynamical justification is performed). In the
superstatistics  factor  one  averages  not  only  over  the  values  of  the  finite  temperature,  but  over
other system parameters as well, including the parameters of interaction with the environment.
When passing from the initial distribution containing the lifetimes  of  a  statistical  system  as  an
additional  thermodynamic  parameter,  one  used  the  assumptions  about  the  shape  of  the  system
potential and the expression of the average lifetime from the stochastic storage model (Appendix
A).  A  discrete  version  for  discrete  distribution  is  obtained,  at  which  one  changes  argument
β0r0E→(1-exp{-β0r0E}) in,  for  example,  Tsallis distributions.  Below  we  consider  the  continuos
distributions  precisely  generalizing  the  superstatistics,  and  show  their  correspondence  to  both
known results and several novel trends of investigations.

The  superstatistics  theory  [1,2]  is  the  generalization  of  the  nonextensive  statistical
mechanics [3, 4]. Some of the fields of applications of the nonextensive statistical mechanics are
metastable states, Levy flights, systems of finite size [47]. It is shown in the present work that all
these  phenomena  are  conditioned  physically  by  the  finiteness  of  the  lifetime,  and  by  the
possibilities of small probability big fluctuations which are generally dismissed when accounting
for the system evolution.

The  introduction  of  the  lifetime  (first-passage  time)  as  a  thermodynamic  parameter  is
justified by the fact that finite systems possess finite lifetimes, which essentially influences their
properties and the properties of their environment. The lifetime is interpreted as a fundamental
quality  having  dual  nature  related  to  both  the  flux  of  external  time,  and  the  properties  of  a
system.  In  [18]  the  expressions  for  the  lifetime  through  dynamical  characteristics  of  a  system
were obtained. These expressions show dependence on the interchange with the environment.

In [5, 6, 7, 8, 18] we pointed at the possibilities of describing nonequilibrium behaviour of
arbitrary physical values (by which the system is open to the environment) with accounting for
all factors influencing the interaction to the environment. The lifetime thermodynamics describes
open  systems  far  from  equilibrium  and  can  be  applied  to  the  investigation  of  the  dissipative
structures and other synergetic effects.

We managed to introduce a generalizing physical thermodynamical value – the lifetime of
complex  dynamical  systems.  The  thermodynamic  way  of  description  aims  at  elucidating  the
general  properties  and  statistical  laws  which  do  not  depend  on  the  peculiarities  of  the  matter
structure  and  are  universal  invariants.  The  contents  of  the  thermodynamics  are  the  set  of  such
results. Since the finiteness of lifetime of arbitrary realistic systems is a universal property, we
believe its inclusion into the thermodynamic description  to be fruitful and necessary.

where t0  is average time of an output from system of one particle. A statistical system possesses
the state of the stationarity. The thermodynamical values at stationarity do not depend on time,
and the average of the parameters does not change. Thereby P0=Q-1=limt→∞ P{Z(t)=0|Z(0)=Z0},
where P0 is the probability of degeneration, Q is grand canonical sum of the big canonical Gibbs
stationary (close to equilibrium) ensemble. For the storage model with constant exit rate P0=0,
ρ≥a; P0=1-ρ/a, ρ<a. Thus for the stable case with ρ<a, ρ/a=1-P0=1-Q–1. Inserting this value of
ρ/a  into  (А.2),  we  get:  <Γ>=Γ0=(Q-1)/λ,  where  Γ0  means  stationary  lifetime  value  without
perturbation. This expression coincides with (18).

The open system is considered, and the value ρ represents some stochastic flow. If there
are any stationary forces v, then ϕf(y)=ϕ(y)-yf, where f is function of stationary force. Then ρf=ρ-
f, and  -f=<Iv> is average value of the flux caused by action of force f. Thus

<Γ >=<xf>tf /af(1-ρf/af) ,                                                                                         (A.3)
where <xf>=∫xbf(x)dx, tf is average time of an output from system of one particle at the influence
of force v and in the  presence of the flux f. In a stationary case dZ/dt=ρf -af(1-P0f)=0, since P0f
=1-ρf/af. The value ρf is equal to an average of the stationary flux in the system.

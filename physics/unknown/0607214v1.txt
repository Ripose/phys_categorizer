Abstract 

We start from the author´s metric for a rotating and accelerating Universe and we 

calculate  the  force  acting  on  a  particle  in  it.  This  force  consists  of  two parts:  one  is 

derived  from  a  potential,  and  the  other  describes  a  Coriolis  force  coming  from  the 

overall rotation of the Universe. We then write down the equations of motion, and we 

solve them analytically in the Newtonian approximation. The result has to describe in 

particular a spiral arm. It consists of two parts. The first one disappears in the case of 

slow rotation of the Universe, as it must be the case for our real Universe. The second 

one, with appropriate adjustment of the constants involved, gives right a logarithmic 

helix, as it has been found empirically to be the case for our Galaxy (in particular).

1.  Introduction 

In  a  previous  paper  [1]  the  author,  motivated  by  the  observation  of  an  amazing 

similarity between a spiral galaxy and a cyclon on Earth (and since the latter is due to 

the overall rotation of Earth), attempted to find an appropriate metric for the Universe, 

which  would  describe  a  rotation  of  it  as  a  whole.  After  a  couple  of  unsuccesful 

attempts, he managed finally to arrive at the desirable metric. 

To  this  end  he  wrote  down  an  appropriate  form  of  the  metric  describing  two 

rotations  of  the  Universe  as  a  whole  (assuming  it  as  embedded  in  a  fictitious  four-

dimensional space), and after a lot of analytical work he derived the resulting Einstein 

field equations. Then, after a lot of effort too, he managed to solve them analytically. 

The result was a new metric of a doubly rotating Universe. 

The interpretation given to these two rotations, at the first place, was that one of 

the rotations describes a usual ratation, while the other one, surprisingly, describes an 

acceleration of the recessional velocities of galaxies. 

The  first  application  of  the  metric  found  by  the  author  was  to  explain  the 

differential rotation of galaxies [2]. Namely he found right that the linear velocity of 

the stars of a galaxy about its center is almost constant for any particular galaxy. 

The second application, the present paper, is dealing with the original motivation 

underlying [1]. Namely, the author tries to find the equation describing a spiral arm of 

a  galaxy,  by  finding  the  motion  followed  by  a  particle  in  the  new  metric  of  the 

Universe.  And  since  the  spiral  structure  resembles  the  motions  in  a  cyclon,  then  it 

would be apparent that the similarity would be caused by similar causes, namely the 

rotation  of Earth on the one hand and the rotation of the Universe on the other hand, 

as intuitively was believed in the beginning.

Thus,  the  equations  governing  the  motion  of  a  particle  in  the  new  metric  of  the 

Universe  are  derived  in  the  Newtonian  approximation  in  section  2.  Then  they  are 

solved  analytically  in  section  3.  In  section  4  the  author  finds  especially  the  spatial 

metric, which then makes possible a suitable renaming of the coordinates, in order to 

get  the  right  geometrical  interpretation.  It  is  then  obvious  that  we  are  dealing  with 

cylindrical  coordinates  (  in  the  approximation  used).  In  section  5  we  derive  (after 

suitable eliminations) a single equation describing the spiral arms, which turns out to 

be a logarithmic helix, which means in agreement with the observations.

We  recognize  immediately  the  relation  (36)  as  giving  flat  space  in  cylindrical

Eliminating t in (37) by substituting simply t by z, since z is merely a linear function 

of t in (37a), we get from the other two ones of (37) the solution

In order to eliminate also z between the above equations, we first get from (38a)

Introducing  then  this  into  (38b),  we  obtain  for  the  special  case  that  G  =  E  =  0  (for 

simplicity) after absorbing appropriately F and C,

Considering  a  very  slow  rotation  (&2  <<  1  ),  the  first  term  in  (41)  becomes 

negligible. Then taking C = 1/0.22 & F = - ln3.4/0.11, we have (for example) the well 

known equation describing empirically a spiral arm of our Galaxy (logarithmic helix) 

[3], namely

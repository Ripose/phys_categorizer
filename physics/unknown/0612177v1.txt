Abstract.  Variance-spectral analysis of superconducting gravimeter (SG) decadal data (noise inclusive) 
suggests  conceptually  that  the  Earth  tectonogenesis  could  in  part  be  based  on  magnification  of  the 
mantle  mechanical  resonance,  in  addition  to  previously  hypothesized  causes.  Here,  the  use  of  raw 
(gapped and unaltered) data is regarded as the criterion for a physical result’s validity, so data were not 
altered  in  any  way.  Then  analogously  to  the  atmospheric  tidal  forcing  of  global  high-frequency  free 
oscillation,  I  propose  that  the  Moon’s  synodically  recurring  pull  could  likewise  drive  the  long-periodic 
(12-120 minutes) oscillation of the Earth.  To demonstrate this, I show that the daily magnitudes of mass 
(gravity)  oscillation,  as  a  relative  measure  of  the  Earth  kinetic  energy,  get  synodically  periodic  while 
correlating up to 0.97 with seismic energies on the day of shallow and 3 days before deep earthquakes. 
The forced oscillator equations for the mantle’s usual viscosity and the Earth springtide and grave mode 
periods  successfully  model  an  identical  3-days  phase.  Finally,  whereas  reports  on  gravest  earthquakes 
(of  ~M9.5)  put  the  maximum  co-seismic  displacement  at  ~10  m,  the  same  equations  predict  the 
maximum displacement as 9.8 m, too.  Hence, pending the proof to the opposite, the same mechanism 
that  causes  bridges  to  collapse  under  the  soldiers  step  marching  could  be  making  the  lithosphere  fail 
under  the  springtide-induced  magnification  of  mantle’s  resonance  resulting  in  strong  earthquakes  of 
unspecified  type  (most  of  some  400  earthquakes  that  affected  the  SG  in  1990-ies  were  strike-slip  and 
thrust).    If  this  assertion  is  correct,  then  some  large  earthquakes  could  be  predictable  –  spatially  and 
temporally – by monitoring the tidal vs. grave mode oscillation periodicities of separate tectonic bodies 
in the upper mantle and in the crust. 

Keywords: tectonogenesis; tectonophysics; spectral analysis. 

 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
I  use  superconducting  gravimeter  (SG) 
1Hz  observations  to  show  that  it  could  be 
useful  to  regard  the  Earth  a 
forced 
mechanical  oscillator  in  which  resonant 
magnification  of  Earth  total-mass  (mostly 
the mantle) resonance occurs. This means 
that  the  Earth  tectonics  and  related 
phenomena  could  also  be  mechanically 
caused,  in  addition  to  thermo-nuclear-
chemical  causes  hypothesized  in  the  past. 
The  lunar  synodic  semi-monthly  forcing 
drives the long periodic (here between 12-
120 minutes) oscillation magnitudes of the 
Earth’s  total  mass  (geophysical  noise 
inclusive). 

References  on  “tidal  triggering  of 
earthquakes” are numerous (ICET, 2002).  
For  example,  Tamrazyan  (1959),  Knopoff 
(1970) and Weems and Perry (1989) found 
a  correlation  between  tidal  potential  and 
times of occurrence of earthquakes on the 
lunar  synodic  time-scale  at  ~14.8  days, 
while  Tanaka  et  al.  (2004)  asserted 
azimuth-dependent 
in 
regional  shallow  seismicity.  However,

many  of  the  tidal  triggering  claims  have 
been  disputed.  For  instance,  Melchior 
(1986)  dismissed  Knopoff  (1970),  stating 
that  only  semidiurnal  tide  has  sufficient 
power  to  trigger  earthquakes.  Jeffreys 
(1970)  did  not  even  make  reference  to 
fortnightly  periods 
in  discussing  tidal 
triggering,  while  Stein  (2004)  questioned 
Tanaka  et  al.  (2004)  proposing  that  it  be 
tested “whether it is the oscillatory nature 
of  tidal  stress  –  rather  than  its  small 
magnitude  –  that 
inhibits  triggering”

2. Methodology 
 
Gravity  spectra  were  obtained  in  the 
Gauss-Vaníček spectral analysis (GVSA) of 
over ten billion non-equispaced, Gaussian-
filtered  SG  gravity  decadal  recordings 
from the 1990-ies.  GVSA fits, in the least-
trigonometric 
squares  sense,  data 
functions.    GVSA  was  first  proposed  by 
Barning  (1963),  was  first  developed  by 
Vaníček  (1969,  1971),  and  was  simplified 
by  Lomb  (1976)  and  Scargle  (1976).  
Magnitudes  of  GVSA-derived,  variance-
spectrum peaks depict the contribution of 
a period to the variance of the time-series, 
of  the  order  of  (some)  %  (Vaníček,  1969).  
Thus, variance spectra, expressed in var%, 
or  power  spectra,  expressed 
in  dB 
(Pagiatakis,  1999)  can  be  produced  from 
incomplete  numerical  records  of  any 
length.  Thanks  to  its  many  important 
advantages,  GVSA  was  a  more  suitable 
technique for GTS than any of the typically 
used  tools  such  as  the  Fourier  spectral 
analysis (Press et al., 2003, Omerbashich, 
2006).    GVSA  seemed  most  apt  for  GTS 
primarily  due  to  its:  (i)  ability  to  handle

The  choice of  surface magnitudes  in 
Eq.  (4)  rather  than  moment  magnitudes 
was  not  just  preferential.  Namely,  more 
than  96%  of  all  >M6.39  earthquakes  that 
affected  the  Cantley  SG  record  were 
weaker  than  M7.5  (when  the  scales  based

Hence,  using  surface  magnitudes  rather 
than  moment  magnitudes  represents  a 
more  stringent  approach  given  that  the

to a small number of relatively large input

In  all  cases  (models),  the  strongest 
response  was  in  mantle-sensitive  0P7  and 
0T7 modes, while the lithosphere-sensitive 
0P2 and  0T2 also returned high correlation 
values  with  deep  earthquakes,  Fig.  2b.  
Depth-separation  revealed  a  3-days  delay 
in  correlation,  Fig.  2b.    In  a  statistical 
study  of  7359  deep  ≥M3  earthquakes 
Curchin and Pennington (1987) speculated 
that  a  delay  in  deep  rupture  might  be  in 
effect,  without  proposing  the  duration  of 
 ωμ are 
such  a  delay.    Then,  given  that  D
diurnal averages, if it exists I assume that 
for most earthquakes such a deep-rupture 
delay  is  either  Δt1  <<  1/2  day,  or  Δt2  >  1 
day.  As deduced from the variance spectra 
(but not the power spectra) of SG gravity, 
the  gravity-seismicity  correlation  has  an 
absolute  maximum  for  periods  ~821  s  or

modes  of  the  Zharkov  model  as  the  most 
recent of the three Earth models used. 

Correlations  Eq.  6  were  checked  by

i.e.,  by  using:  (i)  three 
geophysical  Earth  models,  (ii)  surface 
instead  of  moment  seismic  magnitudes, 
(iii)  the  lowermost  part  of  the  Earth 
natural band, (iv) variance- versus power-
spectra,  and  (v)  seismic  energies  versus 
seismic magnitudes. In order to check the 
extracted  periodicity  of  the  spectrum  of 
the  spectra  of  gravity,  I  look  at  the  entire 

arXiv.org 

In  all  three  Earth-models  tested, 
gravity-seismicity correlations were higher 
when  seismic  energies  were  used  rather 
than  seismic  magnitudes,  as  well  as  when 
variance  spectra  were  used  rather  than 
power  spectra.  Also,  the  more  recent 
model produced higher correlation in case 
of  deep  earthquakes.  Superconducting 
gravimeters  can  sense  globally  minute  (in 
the  order  of  0.01  var%)  mass  re-
distributions  of  the  inner  masses.  Thus 
contrary 
to  some  opinions,  such  as 
Hinderer  and  Crossley  (2004),  depending 
on  the  choice  of  signal  and  noise  the 
removal  of  atmospheric  and  other 
environmental  effects  is  not  necessary  for 
all purposes.  Note that, while the gravity-
seismicity correlation Eq. (6) is frequency-
dependent,  Merriam  (1992)  showed  that 
the  relationship  between  local  pressure 
(here 
information 
second-largest 
constituent)  and  SG-sampled  gravity  is 
independent  of  frequency  and  epoch. 
Furthermore, it can be seen from Smylie et 
al.  (1993)  that  the  air  pressure-  and 
gravity-spectra  are  not  expected  to  show 
any  resemblance.    Finally,  the  amplitude 
of  the  theoretical  tidal  gravity  signal, 
observed  here  at  0.068  c.p.d.  reaches  at 
least  1–2  μGal  according  to  Tamura 
(1987), corresponding to a change of 5–10 
mm  vertically,  or  1.2  –2.5  m  in  latitude.  
This  is  well  within  the  SG  accuracy  as 
given in Merriam et al. (2000), so that any 
signal  possibly  found  in  the  spectra of  SG 
data, cannot be exclusively due to geodetic 
effects of either height or latitude.

filters  can  enhance  or  reduce  spectral

Response  in  var%  of  the  processing 
viewed as a filter, i.e., of a data processing 
procedure  based  on  spectral  analyses 
should  determine  whether  any  classical 
noise, naturally measured by variance, was 
dominating  the  extraction  of  the  spring-
tidal  periodicity  from  gravity  spectra.    To 
compute  this  response,  white  noise  was 
fed 
the  computational  procedure; 
meaning  a  “month  long”  test-record  was 
processed  containing  random  numbers 
between  (0,  1),  limits  inclusive.

resulting  Fig.  3  shows  that  the  processing

consequence of filter amplification.

The maximum magnitudes on Fig. 4 
are  limited  by  the  frequency-magnitude 
response  of  the  processing  designed  to 
suppress  the  impact  of  classical  noise  on 
spectral  magnitudes  at  long  periods  of 
around  half  month,  Fig.  3.    Although 
largely  limited  by  the  processing,  the 
14.71-days  period  still  exceeds  the  99% 
confidence  level,  Fig.  4,  indicating  a  high 
strength  of  this  period.  All  other  periods 
shorter  than  13  days  and  longer  than  16 
days,  seen  on  Fig.  4  as  not  reaching  the 
99%  confidence  level,  are  artifacts  of  the 
processing. 

If  the  spring  tide  causes  the  14.71-
day  period,  this  period’s  estimate  should 
 Eμ  
get  fully  enhanced  in  the  series  of  D
obtained  over  all  spectral  lines  from  the 
El∈12–120  c.p.d.  band  of  interest.  That 
should  improve  this  period’s  estimate  to 
about  the  size  of  the  filtering  step,  since 
 Eμ series reflects the dynamics of the

further – by simply increasing the spectral

represent  a  residual  from  data  processing 
as  no  systematic  noise  was  cleared  from 
the  record  to  begin  with.  Also,  the 
processing  did  not  amplify  these  two 
periods  as  it  was,  in  fact,  designed  to 
suppress  all  the  contents  at  around  half  a 
month;  see  Fig.  3.    Thus,  the  two  periods 
are  not  in  the  SG  data  per  sé,  and  the 
entire  data,  i.e.,  the  field  they  sample, 
oscillate with  those  two  periods.  This  sort 
of  sensitivity  was  attainable  due  to  SG 
accuracy,  discussed  earlier,  appreciably 
exceeding  the  ratio  between  the  force  of 
Earth  gravity  and  the  maximum  lunar 
tidal  force,  of  ~1.14:10–7  (Hendershott, 
1994). 

Obviously, since we speak of gravity, 
the  inclusion  of  gravity  components  that 
are due to non-solid Earth masses such as 
the  atmosphere,  as  well as  of  those  in  the 
deep  interior  (mantle-to-core)  had  little 
importance  in  inflating  these  two  periods 
– due to low density and distance from the 
lithosphere,  respectively.    Here,  normal 
eigenperiods  were  used  because  they  are 
the  natural  beat  periods  of  all  Earth 
masses  that  comprise  gravity  and  cause 
the  Earth  oscillations  in  general,  not  just 
the  Earth  free  oscillation.  I  therefore 
checked  the  periodicity  obtained  along  all 
normal  mode  periods,  Fig.  4,  against  the 
result  from  using  complete  environment 
information,  Fig.  5.    As  seen  above,  this 
resulted  in  an  excellent  accuracy  of  the 
lunar  period  estimate,  confirming  the 
starting  premise  on  both  the  SG  accuracy 
as well as the GTS validity. 

Concept: 
Earth  may  be  a  viscous,  stopped  up 
mechanical  oscillator  forced  externally 
mostly  by  the  Moon’s  orbital  period  due 
to  which  the  states  of  a  maximum  mass 
(gravity)  oscillation  magnification  and  a 
maximum stored potential energy occur. 

 

A 

georesonator’s 

total  mass 
oscillates with the springtide period, so the 
Earth  oscillation  is  not  just  free  but 
constrained  as  well;  meaning  rather  than 
observing  the  response  of  the  Earth  as  a 
system under exclusively free motion, as it 
has  been  done  in  geophysics  so  far,  this 
specific concept requires that the response 
of  the  Earth  system  under  forced  motion 
be observed instead. Then in such a global 
forced  oscillator  first  proposed  by  Tesla 
(1919),  where 
is 
proportional  to  the  velocity  of  the  body 
(French,  1971),  the  Earth  grave  mode  0P2 
is  the  system’s  normal  period  and  the 
lunar  synodic  period 
is  the  system’s 
forcing period due to which the states of a 
maximum  oscillation  magnification  and  a 
maximum  stored  potential  energy  occur 
(Den Hartog, 1985).

the spectral spread of the system response

understanding that the size of large strike-
slip  earthquakes  (in  this  study  the  most-
used  type)  is  not  related  just  to  the 
amount of stress-strain buildup (Cisternas 
et  al.,  2005).    Earthquake  triggering  is  a 
arise 
phenomenon 
exclusively  due  to  the  release  of  static 
strain  by 
foregoing  earthquake. 
Instead,  seismicity  gets  activated  also  by 
direct  shaking,  i.e.,  mechanically  (Felzer 
and  Brodsky,  2006).    To  explain  this,  the 
Earth  must  be  regarded  as  a  mechanical 
oscillator.  Finally, 
stress-strain 
buildup  is  virtually  absent  in  the  mantle 
where  a  forced-oscillator  model  seems  to 
be able to satisfy the observed trending of 
the  gravity-deep  seismicity  correlation.  
Note that during the great ~M9.3 Sumatra 
earthquake  of  December  2004,  numerous 
reports  have  put  this displacement  at ~10 
m average.  Also, the ~M9.5 seem to be the 
strongest earthquakes possible.

The  spring  tide  exerts  pull  on  all 
Earth  masses.  In  case  of  the  mantle’s 
plastic environment, this pull seems to be 
affecting  the  mantle  at  the  300-400  km 
depths.  The  absolutely  highest  gravity-
deep  seismicity  correlation  was  at  the 
~821  sec  eigenperiod,  at  the  Pacific  Rim. 
Inserting To = 821 sec into Eqs. (8) and (9) 
yields  that  region’s  own  ~18.5  h  phase 
shift.  The < 1-day phase shift could be due 
to  the  facts  that  (a)  shallow  earthquakes 
correlate

As Rubin et al. (2005) demonstrated 
it, mantle melts take only a few decades to 
generate,  transfer,  accumulate  and  erupt, 
opposite to previous estimates of ~103 yrs.  
The  georesonator  concept  offers  an 
obvious mechanism  for rapid transport of 
mantle melt, where tectonics is partially a 
consequence  of  the  resonating  mantle’s 
fast  dynamics  at  a  swift  rate  that  equals 
the time which takes for the 3-days phase 
to start affecting the SG sensitivity. 

In the view of the proposed concept I

The  ratio  of  seismic  energy  ES  and  total 
kinetic energy EK on Earth is constant. 

 
 
Based  on  the  above-defined  model 
and its own rule (a claim which holds only 
under  certain  conditions;  a  law  in  a  non-
strict  sense),  I  propose  the  following 
extension  of  the  proposal  that  some 
earthquakes  could  be  caused  by  mantle’s 
magnified resonance:

level  of  speculation  (untested),  for  if  it 
holds  it  would  require  that  each  tectonic 
structure  have  its  own  grave  mode  and 
structural  eigenfrequencies  as  well  as  its 
own  phase  shift,  all  of  which  puts  such 
testing beyond the scope of this paper. 

Importantly,  Eqs.  (8)  -  (11)  produce 
nonsensical  results  for  the  Earth–Sun 
system.  That  is  expected  since,  unlike  the 
Moon  the  Sun  “orbits”  about  the  Earth 
only  apparently.    This  further  legitimizes 
the  proposed  concept  by  providing 
relevance for the real Earth.

6. Discussion 
 
As  the Earth  masses  bulge  during  the 
springtide,  their  oscillatory  movement 
maximum 
attains 
full 
amplitude during  each  new  and 
Moon.   As  seen  in  Section  4,  I  detected 
these conjunction and opposition peaks in 
the spectrum  of the spectra of SG gravity. 
No 
that  would  either 
introduce  or  amplify  the  two  periodicities 
could exist, since the perfect periodicity of 
 Eμ   series  is  superimposed  naturally 
the  D
onto  the  periodicity  of  any  information 
the 
constituent  alone  and  hence  of 
 ωμ series  too.  This  voids  the  possibility 
D
for  any  intermediary  to  introduce  the  two 
periods  anew.  This  causality,  along  with 
the  above  theoretical  delay  which  I  also 
observed  experimentally  as  shown 
in 
Section  3,  and  the  maximal  well-known 
displacement  which 
I  also  obtained 
theoretically  in  Section  5,  constitute  a 
 ωμ – 
sufficient  condition,  while  the  D
seismicity  correlation  at  mantle-sensitive 
and 
modes 
constitutes  a  necessary  condition  for  the 
Earth’s lithosphere and mantle to respond 
to  the  two  periods  by  rupturing.    Rather 
than,  as  speculated  by  some,  directly  and 
simply  “triggering”  the  earthquakes,  the 
revealed  periodicities  in  the  proposed 
concept either trigger the Earth oscillation 
itself,  or  add  to  the  oscillations  that  were 
already  triggered  by  earthquakes.  Then, 
the  mechanism  behind  the  discovered 
correlation  can  be  either  (i)  the  direct 
 
 
 
Corollary speculation 
 
According  to  the  forced  global  oscillator 
concept,  all  gravitational  considerations 
performed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Earth, 
such as those aimed at determining G, e.g., 
Baldi  et  al.  (2001),  had  failed  to  account 
lunar  magnification  of  total-mass 
for 
the 
(gravity) 
considerations,  Eq.  (7),  or to  factor  in  the 
concerned  location,  ωo  /  ωmax,  as  well  as 
failed to take into account the varying  0P2 
of  the  Earth  total  mass.    The  maximum 
magnification is (Den Hartog, 1985):

in  turn, 
earthquakes  that  have  been, 
triggered  by  long  periodic  tides.  Based  on 
the computations of Eqs. (8) – (11), and on 
the  ideas  of  Melchior  (1986)  and  Jeffreys 
(1970),  I  discard  the  latter  option  (ii) 
above.    Then  the  proposed  concept  does 
not allow for the so-called “tidal triggering 
of 
such.  
Furthermore,  in  reality,  oscillatory  nature 
long  been 
of 
established, for instance Sieh et al. (2005), 
as well as certain related phenomena apart 
from tides, which can trigger earthquakes, 
for instance Thatcher (1982).

Thus,  regarding  the  Earth  as  a 
forced mechanical oscillator could perhaps 
help 
the  Earth 
tectonics. This would require that shallow 
earthquakes do  not  depend exclusively on 
stress-strain  conditions,  when  actual 
prediction 
medium-to-large 
earthquakes  becomes  possible.  Such 
to  determine 
prediction  would  need 
structural eigenfrequencies of the separate 
(tectonic)  mass  bodies  and  systems, 
establish  which  faulting  types  are  most 
seismicity–gravity 
sensitive 
correlations,  Fig.  2,  and  subsequently 
monitor  under  combined  Earth-Moon 
orbital 
structural 
eigenfrequencies  of  tectonic  groups  of 
interest.  The  basic  idea  behind  such  a 
concept  of  earthquake  prediction  is  the 
simplest  one  of  all,  and  it  resembles  the 
infamous  example  of  soldiers  marching

Conclusion 
 
A  gravity-seismicity 
correlation  with 
three-day  phase  is  found  after  comparing 
the decadal SG gravity of total-mass Earth 
with  the  energy  emitted  from  some  50 
strong  deep  earthquakes  from  the  same 
decade.  For  this,  a  concept of  raw  data  as 
the  criterion  in  evaluating  a  physical 
claim’s  validity  was  used.  It  was  shown 
that  the  mechanical  oscillator  equations 
for  a  Moon-forced  georesonator  could 
successfully  model  such  a  3-days  phase. 
The  same  equations  render  maximal 
particle displacement on Earth as about 10 
m,  which  agrees  with  the  commonly 
observed displacement by gravest possible

In  order  to  verify  the  grave  mode  of  the 
Earth’s total-mass oscillation I take the SG 
gravity  recordings  during  three  greatest 
earthquakes 
that 
affected  the  Cantley  SG  record,  Table  A.  
Using  the  to  GVSA  unique  ability  to 
process  gapped  records, 
for 
differences between the spectra of selected 
gravity recordings without gaps and those 
records with gaps artificially introduced.  I 
thus  make  5,  21,  and  then  53  filter-step-
long  (8  and  32  sec)  gaps  in  the  three 
records  respectively,  where  the  order  of 
earthquakes  was  randomly  selected.  By 
observing  the  differences  between  the 
Gauss-Vaníček  (G-V)  spectra  of  complete 
vs. incomplete records,  I look for the first 
instance  when  this  difference  reaches  the 
zero  value.  Since  both  the  complete  and 
incomplete  records  always  described  the 
same instance and the same location when 
and where the same field (in this case the 
Earth  gravity  field)  was  sampled  during 
the  three  energy  emissions,  it  is  precisely 
this value that marks the beginning of the 
Earth’s natural band of oscillation.  If this 
setup  is  correct,  then  the  more  gaps  the 
the  more 
record  has  should  mean 
pronounced  impact  of  the  non-natural 
information onto the spectra, too.  Indeed, 
Figure A shows that more gaps results in a 
clearer  distinction  between  the  natural 
and non-natural bands. 
 
 

 

The  effect  of  any  known  (including 
tidal)  variations  can  be  suppressed  in  the 
GVSA  together  with  processing,  where 
known  periods 
in  form  of  analytical 
functions  or  discrete  data  sets  can  be 
enforced  on  data.    Thus,  when  GVSA  is 
used, no preprocessing is required to strip 
the  observations  of  tides.    Here,  nine 
semidiurnal and diurnal tidal periods were 
enforced

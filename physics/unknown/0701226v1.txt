Abstract
  The author applies, develops and researches mini-sized Micro- AB Thermonuclear Reactors for 
space propulsion and space power systems. These small engines directly convert the high speed 
charged particles produced in the thermonuclear reactor into vehicle thrust or vehicle electricity 
with maximum efficiency.  The simplest AB-thermonuclear propulsion offered allows spaceships 
to reach speeds of 20,000 - 50,000 km/s (1/6 of light speed) for fuel ratio 0.1 and produces a huge 
amount of useful electric energy. Offered propulsion system permits flight to any planet of our 
Solar system in short time and to the nearest non-Sun stars by E-being or intellectual robots during 
a single human life period. 
  Key words: AB-propulsion, thermonuclear propulsion, space propulsion, thermonuclear power system.

Introduction

  At present, both solid and liquid chemical fueled rockets are used for launch to and flights in 
interplanetary outer space. They have been intensively developed since War II when German 
engineer Wernher von Braun (1912-1977) successfully designed the first long distance rocket 
FAU-2. In the subsequent years, liquid and solid rockets reached their developmental peak. Their 
main shortcomings are (1) very high space launch cost of $20,000 – 50,000/kg; (2) large fuel 
consumption; (3) liquid fuel storage problems because oxidizer and fuel (for example; oxygen and 
hydrogen) require cryogenic temperatures, or they are poisonous substances (for example; nitric 
acid, N2O3).
In past years, the author and other scientists have published series of new methods that promise to 
revolutionize space launch and space flight [1-14]. These include cable accelerator, circle launcher 
and space keeper, space elevator transport system, space towers, kinetic towers, the gas-tube 
method, sling rotary method, electromagnetic and electrostatic accelerators, tether system, Earth-
Moon or Earth-Mars non-rocket cable transport system. There include new propulsion and power 
systems such as solar and magnetic sails, Solar wind sail, radioisotope sail, electrostatic space sail, 
laser beam, kinetic anti-gravitator, multi-reflective beam propulsion system, asteroid employment 
electrostatic levitation, etc. (Too, there are new ideas in aviation that can be useful for flights in the 
atmosphere.)
 Some of these have the potential to decrease space launch costs thousands of times, others allow 
changing the speed and direction of space apparatus without expending fuel. 
The thermonuclear propulsion and power method is very perspective -- though not speculative --
because it promises high vehicular apparatus speed up 50,000 km/s. This method needs a small, 
special thermonuclear reactor that will allow the direct and efficient utilization of the kinetic energy 
of nuclear particles – the AB Thermonuclear Reactor –first offered by author [15].

Description of innovations
 The AB thermonuclear propulsion and electric generator are presented in fig.1. As it is shown in 
[15] the minimized, or micro-thermonuclear reactor 1 generates high-speed charged particles 2 and 
neutrons that leave the reactor. The emitted charged particles may be reflected by electrostatic 
reflector, 4, or adsorbed by a semi-spherical screen 3; the neutrons may only be adsorbed by screen 
3.
  In screen of the AB-thermonuclear reactor (fig.1a) the forward semi-spherical screen 3 adsorbed 
particles that move forward. The particles, 2, of the back semi-sphere move freely and produce the 
vehicle’s thrust. The forwarded particles may to warm one side of the screen (the other side is heat 

2
protected) and emit photons that then create additional thrust for the apparatus. That is the photon
AB-thermonuclear thruster. 
  In reflector AB-thermonuclear reactor (fig.1b) the neutrons fly to space, the charged particles 5 
are reflected the electrostatic reflector 4 to the side opposed an apparatus moving and create thrust.
   The screen-reflector AB-thermonuclear reactor (fig.1c) has the screen and reflector
  The spherical AB-propulsion-generator (fig.1d) has two nets which stop the charged particles and 
produced electricity same as in [14] Chapter 17.  Any part 8 of the sphere may be cut-off from 
voltage and particles 9 can leave the sphere through this section and, thusly, create the thrust. We 
can change direction of thrust without turning the whole apparatus.

respectively; e = 1,610-19 C is charge of electron; ro is radius of nuclear force, m; A is number of

   For example, for reaction H+H (hydrogen, Z1 = Z2 =1, ro  210-15 m) this energy is  0.7 MeV 
or 0.35 MeV for every particle. The real energy is about 30 times less because some particles have 
more than average speed and there is a tunnel effect.     
2. Energy needed for ignition. Fig. 8 [15] shows a magnitude n (analog of Lawson criterion) 
required for ignition. 
   Present-day industry produces powerful lasers:
 Carbon dioxide lasers emit up to 100 kW at 9.6 µm and 10.6 µm, and are used in industry for 

cutting and welding. 

 Carbon monoxide lasers must be cooled, but can produce up to 500 kW.

and Bremsstrahlung emission are less then electron frequency in plasma.

Results of computation
1. Some thermonuclear reactions. The primary nuclear reaction is D-D reaction that takes place 
when two nuclei of deuterium collide. Deuterium can be obtained from seawater, its abundance 
being about 0.0148% that of hydrogen, and used as a fuel resource, this amount can be regarded as 
almost inexhaustible.
  The D-D reaction consists of the following two reactions:
D+D  3He + n +3.27 MeV,    50% ,
D+D  T + H +4.03 MeV .     50% ,

(17)
(18)

  In reaction (17) an isotope of helium (3He) and neutron (n) are produced by the collision of two 
deuterium nuclei (D). In reaction (2), a tritium (T) and a proton (H) are produced. The numbers on 
the right-side denote the kinetic energy released by the reaction, which can be calculated us 
follows: If we denote the mass defect of each particle in the unit of MeV (106 eV), we have D: 

5
13.1359 Mev, He: 14.9313 MeV, and n: 8.0714 Mev  ([16], p. 1295), so that the energy released by 
reaction (17) is 

2  13.1359 - (14.9313 + 8.0714) = 3.2691 = 3.27 MeV. 

   For reaction (18), we can use for T: 14.9500 Mev and for H: 7.289 MeV.
  The partition of the released energy from the reaction products can be estimated from energy and 
momentum conservation.  Kinetic energy of D before collision is very small compared to the 
energy released by the reaction. We can ignore the initial kinetic energy and treat the deuterium 
nuclei as being at rest. Denoting the mass and speed of helium and n by 1 and 2 respectively, we 
have for reaction (17)

relations, we find

 Obviously, the lighter particle acquires more energy than the heavier particle.
   Current nuclear fusion research is focused on the D + T thermonuclear fusion reaction 

D + T  4He(3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV),
Reaction (21) can occur in high-temperature deuterium-tritium plasma. Most energy released by the 
reaction is converted to the kinetic energy of the neutron. Since the neutron is not confined or 
reflected by a magnetic or electrostatic field it leaves, going outwards to surrounding space or hits 
the screen or vessel wall (or blanker) immediately after reaction. In last instance, the neutron 
kinetic energy is converted to heat. The heat is taken away from the screen by direct radiation or 
and indirect circulating coolant and can be used to run an electric generator. If we add 6Li inside the 
blanket, then tritium can be produced by reaction

(21)

n + 6Li  4He (2.1 MeV) + T (2.7 MeV)

(22)

and then used as the fuel. Another reaction product is the alpha particles 4He carrying 3.5 MeV 
which can be directed or confined by electro-magnetic field.
  The reaction that produces only charged particles are best for the proposed propulsion system and 
generator. Unfortunately, these reactions are not great (see Table 1).
  However, since the nuclei are positively charged, they must have enough energy to overcome the 
Coulomb repulsion between them, in order for a few of them to be able to combine. The required 
energy can be estimated by equation (1).

 Conventionally, we have two components on the equation’s right-side having different mass and 
speed. The average efficiency particle speed V (impulse) of thermonuclear reaction may be

  The first column shows the thermonuclear reaction. In left side from pointer it is shown the 
components of thermonuclear reactor fuel. In the right-side it is shown the particles which appear in 
the reaction and kinetic energy every particle in MeV.
  The second column shows the efficiency impulse (in m/s) computed by equation (18) for AB-
screen engine.
  The third column shows the maximum speed which apparatus (equipped with an engine screen) 
reaches a fuel mass ratio equal to 0.1 (equation (20)).
  The fourth and fifth column shows the efficiency impulse and maximum apparatus speed for AB-
reflector engine.
  The sixth column shows the final mass of the space apparatus when the mass of initial fuel equals 
zero. In the first two reactions this ratio is not 0.1 because the neutrons are adsorbed by the screen. 
That decreases the apparatus speed, but the neutrons can be harnessed to get additional fuel and to 
sustain other useful and valuable thermonuclear reaction. All computation in Table 1 is made for 
mass ratio 0.1.
 The last (seventh) column shows the additional speed from hot one-sided screen emitting photons. 
This additional speed is small.
  The thrust of the spherical thruster-generator (fig.1d) for small angles may be computed as for 
AB-screen engine. Thrust is proportion the ratio of the open area to the full sphere surface. 
  The power of electric generator may be estimated by equation

  For example, let us take the reaction D+T and fuel consumption mf = 10-5 kg/s. Then Np /N = 4/5, 
E = 3.5 MeV and W  1.34106 kW; thrust T  100 N; the relative mass converted into energy is 
3.7510-3. If the fuel consumption is mf = 10-2 kg/s, the thrust is T  105 N. The energy is gigantic 
W  1.34109 kW.
   Table 1 shows that the offered thermonuclear AB-propulsions can accelerate the space apparatus 
up the speed (20  50)106 m/s (or up 1/6 of light speed) with a fuel ratio of Mf /M0  = 0.1. The AB-
propulsion is the most efficient of all thermonuclear propulsions, capable of reaching the theoretic 
maximum impulse from currently known thermonuclear propulsions and known thermonuclear 
reactions.  
   Please note that the reaction that produces only charged particles is more efficient than reactions 
producing neutrons and charged particles (two in the first lines of Table 1). The neutrons accept a 
lot of a common energy, but this energy does not produce any thrust. Converting this energy into 
photons (column 7 of table 1) is also ineffective. The neutrons do not leave the space apparatus, 
increasing its final launch and travel weight (column 6) and decreasing the final apparatus speed. 
They may be used for next reaction (see (22) and below), but technical realization of such reaction 
is decidedly complex and presently unproductive. See some of these reactions below. 
Unfortunately, most neutron reactions are exoteric.

 The spherical AB-engine can produce much electrical energy, but conversion of this energy into 
vehicular thrust by common electric (ion) propulsion is inefficient in comparison with the offered 
AB-engine. 

Discussion
 The potential space traveling apparatus speed 1/6 of light speed is maximum velocity predicted by 
thermonuclear AB-propulsion. That speed allows Mars to be a destination in minutes (or some days 
when apparatus has limited acceleration); that very high speed allows short period trips throughout 
our Solar system. However, it is not sufficient for easy interstellar space trips. The nearest star 
system is located at a distance of 3 - 5 light-years. That means the trip requires a minimum of 40 -
60 years. But required fuel ratio Mf /M0 is very high: acceleration and braking of moving apparatus 
needs 4-stage rocket having the ratio for every stage Mf /M0  = 0.1. The total weight fuel ratio will 
be Mf /M0  = 10-4. If useful weight is 10 tonnes, the starting rocket mass is M0 /Mf  = 104 tonnes. The 
relative mass of thermonuclear reaction converted into energy (and thrust) is only 0.3  0.4% of 
total fuel mass. The author’s research so far shows that the magnet cannot adsorb the big amount of 
interstellar matter in the high apparatus speed mode; consequently, the envisioned apparatus must 
take fuel for the entire trip. 
  Human interstellar flight is very expensive and complex. We can develop long-distance 
communication system and send, instead, E-men [18, 19] or artificial intelligent robot.         
  However, only an annihilation reaction can efficiently solve the interstellar trip macro-problem.  
Otherwise, new physics discoveries that allow such trips is required.

Conclusion
 The author suggests the simplest maximally efficient thermonuclear AB-propulsion (and electric 
generators) based in the early offered size-minimized Micro-AB-thermonuclear reactor [15]. These 
engines directly convert high-speed charged particles produced in thermonuclear reactor into 
vehicular thrust or onboard vehicle electricity resource. Offered propulsion system allows travel to 
any of our Solar System’s planets in  a short time as well as trips to the nearest stars by E-being or 
intellectual robot in during a single human life [18 ]- [19].

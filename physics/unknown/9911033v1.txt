Abstract

The  influence  of  linearly  and  circularly  polarized  laser  fields  on  the  dynamics  of  fast

electron-impact excitation in atomic  helium  is  discussed.  A  detailed  analysis  is  made  in  the
excitation  of  21S,  31S  and  31D  dressed  states  of  helium  target.  By  using  a  semiperturbative

treatment with the Sturmian basis expansion, we take into account the target atom distortion

induced  by  a  laser  field.  Important  differences  appear  between  the  angular  distributions

depending on the different states of polarization, in particular the circular polarization presents

an  experimental  interest.  We  give  new  features  (intermediate  resonances)  for  both

polarizations,  concerning  the  n  =  2  states  of  helium  for  emission  and  the  n  =  3  for  the

absorption, in term of laser frequency. Qualitative differences from the case of laser-assisted

elastic collisions have been evidenced.

1. Introduction

In the recent years, the study of electron–atom collisions in the presence of a laser field

is a subject of intense research activity, not only because the importance of these processes in

applied  domains  (such  as  plasma  heating),  but  also  in  view  of  their  interest  in  fundamental

atomic collision theory. Experimentally, laser-assisted electron-atom scattering processes have

recently become feasible. Several experiments have been performed, in which the exchange of

one  or  more  photons  between  the  electron–target  and  the  laser  field  has  been  observed  in

laser–assisted elastic [1] and inelastic scattering [2-5]. In particular, the excitation processes

have  been  largely  investigated  in  the  literature  by  several  authors  [6-9],  mainly  in  the

perturbative  (weak-field)  limit.  The  first  theoretical  studies  on  the  inelastic  scattering  were

inspired from the pioneering works [10-12], in which the interaction between the free electron

and the field can be treated exactly (i.e. to all orders in the field strength) by using the exact

Volkov waves [13].

The  incorporation  of  laser  parameters  as  intensity,  frequency  and  in  particular

polarization  in  the  laser–assisted  collisions  gives  interesting  results  and  considerably  enrich

the study of the collision process. The influence of this later parameter have attracted a great

deal  of  attention  in  theoretical  works  and  experimental.  In  fact  the  theoretical  studies  of

polarization  dependence  have  been  previously  performed  by  Cavaliere  et  al.  [14]  for

Simultaneous  electron–photon  excitation  at  high  impact  energies  and  large  differences  have

been  predicted.  For  impact  energies  near  threshold  there  is  experimental  evidence  of

differences between linear  and circular polarization [15] and a recent extension of the Kroll

and  Watson  theory  by  Mittleman  [16]  predicts  differences  in  the  first  order  of  the

development of the transition amplitude as a function of the laser frequency. Taïeb et al [17]

studied  the  influence  of  the  laser  polarization  on  the  angular  distribution  of  the  ejected

electron in laser-assisted (e, 2e) reactions. Fainstein and Maquet [18] studied the polarization

dependence  of 

laser–assisted  electron–hydrogen  elastic  collisions,  where 

important

differences  appear  between  the  angular  distributions  depending  on  the  different  states  of

polarization.

In the present paper we want to extend our previous results [22] to the case of laser-

assisted inelastic electron-helium collisions. A comparison between the two

3

polarizations linear and circular of  electric laser field will be made for different geometries.

We  have  performed an ‘‘exact’’ evaluation of the needed  infinite  sum-over-states,  based  on

simplified  hydrogenic  functions  of  the  excited  spectrum  of  helium  [12].  In  the  purpose  to

confirm  our  numerical  results,  we  have  performed  the  calculations  as  in  our  previous  paper

[22]  by  two  different  methods  both  based  on  the  Sturmian  basis  expansion.  The  first  one

consists  in  expanding  the  radial  term  of  the  Coulomb  Green  function  on  a  discrete  basis  of

Sturmian  functions  [19-20],  which  allows  us  to  take  into  account  exactly  the  bound-

continuum-state contributions, which is of crucial importance for electron impact excitation at

intermediate energies [23]. In the second method, the calculation is performed by expanding

the  first-order  perturbed  wave  function  onto  the  same  Sturmian  basis  [17,  21].  The  use  of

these  two  methods  independently  allows  us  to  accurately  determine  the  contribution  of  the

entire singly discrete or continuous excited spectrum (note that the doubly excited states are

not taken into account by these methods). The present technique has been applied extensively

to a variety of laser assisted electron atom collisions involving the transfer of one or several

photons between the electron-atom system and the laser field in the cases of elastic, inelastic

collisions and (e,2e) reactions. We neglect the exchanges effects in the presence work, since

the field-free exchange effects are essentially negligible at the high impact energies considered

here, and they are either smaller or slightly enhanced in the presence of a laser field [24].

The  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  In  section  2  we  present  the  general  formalism  of

laser-assisted  inelastic  electron-helium  collisions  in  the  case  of  linear  and  circular

polarizations.  An  account  is  then  given  of  the  techniques  that  we  have  used  to  evaluate  the

scattering  amplitudes.  Section  3  contains  a  detailed  presentation  of  our  numerical  results  as

well  as  their  physical  interpretations  which  will  be  discussed  in  this  part  and  section  4

concludes the paper. Atomic units used through this paper.

Following our previous work [22], we consider the classical monochromatic and

single mode field, that is spatially homogenous over atomic dimensions and has, in the

be excited after the scattering in one of the ‘‘bound’’ final states. The integer L is the

number  of  photons  transferred  between  the  (electron–helium)  system  and  the  field,

positive values of L correspond to the absorption of photons by the system and negative

ones correspond to stimulated emission of photons.

The  interaction  between  the  projectile  and  the  laser  field  is  treated  exactly  and  his

solution is given by the non–relavistic Volkov wave function

0r represents free electron coordinate.

For  the  interaction  laser–target,  we  are  interested  by  fields  which  have  electric
strengths  smaller  than  the  atomic  unit  (F0  <<  5.109  V/cm),  and  frequencies  different

from the atomic transition energies, then the perturbation theory is the most appropriate

method  to  solve  the  interaction  process.  At  first  order  time–dependent  perturbation

theory  the  ‘‘  dressed  ’’  wave  function 

(n X

  is  well  known  (see  ref.  [22]),  where

quantum number.

Remembering  that  we  are  working  in  the  geometry,  where  the  incident  electron  is

fast and exchange effects are small, we shall, as a first approximation, carry out a first–

Born  treatment  of  the  scattering  process.  The  first–Born  S–matrix  element  for  the
inelastic collision from the ground state of the target to a final excited state of energy E*,

In the case of the excitation of the 21S, 31S and 31D states, we have only the n1P as

intermediate states; it is a simple matter to include all simply excited states of this type.
In  the  case  of  the  excitation  of  the  n1P  states,  we  have  taken  into  account  besides  the
n1D states, the n1S with principal quantum number  n £ 3 only. We note that the doubly

excited target states are neglected because the weak contribution of these states for the

inelastic processes [12].

The  radial  amplitude  (20)  can  be  conveniently  calculated  by  using  a  Sturmian

approach.  In  order  to  double–check  our  numerical  results  we  have  used  two  different

methods,  which  although  relying  both  a  Sturmian  approach,  differ  somewhat  in  the

practicalities of the computation. These methods are namely:

   i) Sturmian expansion of the Coulomb Green function [19-20].

   ii) Sturmian expansion of the first–order perturbed wave function [17, 21, 22].

The  basic  idea  underlying  of  the  two  techniques  that  we  have  used  lies  in  the  expansion

onto the radial Sturmian basis of one or several components of the general amplitude

3. Results and discussion

The present semiperturbative method with the Sturmian basis expansion takes into

account the target atom distortion induced by the presence of laser field. The validity of

our treatment is based on the fact that the laser–helium target interaction is nonresonant.

We  note  that  the  excitation  process  can  be  considered  as  nonresonant  if  for  a  given

frequency,  the  intensity  does  not  exceed  a  certain  limit  [12].  The  condition  on  the

intensity is more stringent if the laser frequency is comparable to any characteristic atom

excitation frequency. Such conditions will be respected by our choice of the Nd–YAG

laser of frequency w

 = 1.17 eV and electric intensity F0 = 106 V/cm.

We  are  interested  in  demonstrating  the  effects  of  the  polarization  effects  in  the

inelastic collision of fast electrons by a helium target in the presence of a laser field. For

linear polarization, we have considered two particular geometries where the polarization

vector of the field is taken to be parallel to the momentum transfer K (F0 // K), and to be

parallel to the wave vector of the incident electron ki (F0 // ki). For circular polarization,

we  have  chosen  two  distinct  geometries  corresponding  respectively  to  the  laser  wave

vector  k  being  perpendicular  to  the  scattering  plane  (CPP)  and  to  be  parallel  to  the

scattering plane (CPC). Note that, for  linear  polarization  the  laser–assisted  differential
cross section only depends on the orientation of the polarization unit vector  (cid:4)e

.

In  order  to  illustrate  the  effects  of  the  laser  polarization  on  the  variations  of  the

differential  cross  sections,  we  have  chosen  to  compare  our  results  obtained  for  F0  //K

(linear  polarization  figure  1-a)  with  those  corresponding  to  CPP  (circular  polarization

figure 1-c). The reason for this particular choice is that the electronic term  felec

B L1, (

)K , is

the same for both geometries, because the argument of the Bessel function reduces to an

identical  value  R

  in  these  two  cases.  The  same  situation  occurs  when  one

compares  the  differential  cross  sections  corresponding  to  F0  //  ki  (  linear  polarization,

figure 1-b) with those obtained for CPC (circular polarization coplanar, figure 1-d), the

argument  of 

the  Bessel  function  being 

then  reduced 

to  an 

identical  value

observed  in  the  angular  dependence  of  the  cross  sections  result  from  the  differences

between the contributions of the atomic terms, i.e. on the dressing of the target.

concerning the phase  g

the  effects  of  the  laser  polarization  on  the  variations  of  the  laser-assisted  differential

cross sections. This phase is particularly important for circular polarization CPC, when

As indicated in our previous paper for elastic scattering [22], we have observed the

existence  of  two  kinds  of  minima  (m1)  and  (m2)  corresponding,  respectively,  to  the

situations when

be observed, in the case of excitation, for large laser frequencies, which are not feasible

in  practice.  So  all  destructive  interferences,  presented  in  this  paper,  correspond  to  the

minimum (m1).

In figure 2(a)  and figure 2(b), we show the  laser-assisted  differential  cross  sections
21S excitation process. The complete  result  obtained  by  using

corresponding to 11S ﬁ

the scattering amplitude Eq.(10) for two polarizations is compared to the ‘‘electronic ’’

cross section in which dressing effects are neglected. As in the case of elastic collisions

[22]  dressing  effects  are  shown  to  be  dominant  in  the  forward  direction  for  linear

see  that  for  angles  below  12°  there  are  important  differences  between  the  two

polarizations.  This  behaviour  is  particularly  important  from  the  experimental  point  of

view since it is in principle easier to measure the laser–assisted differential cross section

amplitudes  (for  larger  scattering  angles),  where  the  dressing  effects  of  the  target

contribute  significantly.  Moreover,  we  notice  a  destructive  interference  between  the

 n1S transitions in the case of inverse bremsstrahlung  L >> 0 . This is due to the
11S ﬁ
presence,  in  the  atomic  term,  of  S-P  transition  amplitudes,  which  behave  like  K-1  for

small K.
      The  results  displayed  in  figures  3(a)  and  3(b)  correspond  to  the  11S ﬁ
transition and show that dressing effects are also dominant for scattering angles q

  31D

 < 15°,

for  both  linear  and  circular  polarizations.  Moreover,  we  note  that  in  this  case  the

interference between the electronic and atomic amplitudes is constructive. This contrasts
with the results obtained for 11S––> n1S transitions. We notice that in the case of 31S
state excitation, a qualitatively similar behaviour, as in the case of 11S––> 21S process,
is observed. We  do  not  show  figures  concerning  11S ﬁ
n1P  transitions,  since  dressing

effects are rather small in this case. Indeed the electronic S-P amplitude, which behaves
like K-1 for small K, now dominates the cross section at small angles.

In the case of emission process L = -1, figure 4 shows an opposite behaviour of the

cross section than for the case of absorption L = 1, in fact, the destructive interference

observed in figure 2(a) and 2(b), for the two geometries F0 // K and F0 // ki of the linear

polarization, becomes constructive, and the constructive interference of the cross section

for  circular  polarization  becomes  destructive.  This  behaviour  can  be  explained  by  the

change of Bessel functions from absorption L = 1 to emission L = -1, making a change

of sign of the atomic amplitude.

 

In figures 5, 6 and 7, we present the frequency dependence of the differential cross

sections for the cases of inverse bremsstrahlung ( absorption of one photon L = 1) and

stimulated bremsstrahlung (emission of one photon L = -1). We take a fixed scattering

Figure 5(a) displays the excitation of 11S ﬁ

31S for absorption of one photon and for the

two polarizations (linear polarization with F0//  K and circular polarization CCP). At a
frequency of w

 13 eV, we remark a minimum for the circular polarization CPP, which

 »

is  induced  by  destructive  interferences  between  electronic  and  atomic  terms  of  the

differential  cross  section.  Indeed,  the  phase-dependent  factor 

ie

k

  present  in  the

atomic term changes the sign of its real part thus making the change from constructive

to destructive interference. This type of minimum can not exist in the linear polarization

where  F0//  K  because,  here  we  have  a  constructive  interference.  For  the  large

frequencies,  abrupt  changes  in  the  vicinity  of  Bohr  transition  frequencies  indicate  that

the behaviour of the cross sections with respect to the laser frequency strongly depends

on the structure of the target. It is interesting to remark the presence of minima between

two  successive  resonances  for  linear  and  circular  polarization.  This  behaviour  results

from  the  fact  that  the  resonant  atomic  amplitudes  change  of  sign  between  two

resonances and can compensate the direct contribution independently of the polarization

state.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  these  scattering  amplitudes  are  sensitive  to  the

presence of those Bohr transitions even far away from resonance. Figure 5(b) displays

the differential cross sections as a function of the laser frequency, for linear polarization

similar  behaviour  as  in  figure  5(a),  with  a  small  shift  of  the  minimum  for  the  CPC

== ,  the  cross  section

k

dependence  in  terms  of  frequency  shows  a  similar  behaviour  as  in  terms  of  scattering

angle. An important point in this figure 5 is the observation of intermediate resonances,

which  correspond  to  transitions  involving  intermediate  states.  Such  peaks  can  be

interpreted as corresponding to Simultaneous Electron -Photon Excitation (SEPE), (see

Appendix). This process (SEPE), which is investigated in the excitation of the helium
23S  state  [27,  28],  can  be  explained  by  an  excitation  which  occur  through  the

accomplished  by  the  absorption  or  the  emission  of  one  photon  energy

  required  to  excite  the  desired  state.  We  note  that  these  peaks

appear in the region of small frequencies.

 The  results  displayed  in  figures  6  correspond  to  the  11S ﬁ

31D  excitation  as  a

function of laser photon energy. We observe in this case destructive interferences for the

two polarizations (linear and circular) and for the different geometries. We observe also

the intermediate resonances corresponding to the SEPE process.

 Figure 7 represents the 11S ﬁ

21S excitation cross section as a function of the laser

photon  energy  in  the  case  of  emission  process  L=-1,  and  shows  a  different  behaviour

than for the case of absorption L = 1 (Figure 8). In fact, for the two polarizations, the

scattering  amplitude  exhibits  peaks  corresponding  to  radiative  transitions  which  are

induced  by  SEPE  process  (see  Appendix).  This  behaviour  of  the  differential  cross

sections, at low frequencies, characterize the excitation of states with principal quantum

number  n=3  for  absorption  and  the  excitation  of  n=2  for  emission  in  term  of

frequencies. Such characteristics constitute one of the main differences between elastic

and inelastic scattering in a laser field. By comparing figure 7 and figure 8, we note that

in the case of bremsstrahlung stimulated, a large difference is observed with respect to

the  case  of  inverse  bremsstrahlung.  This  asymmetry  does  not  exist  in  the  elastic

scattering  case.  We  conclude,  for  these  figures  5,  6  and  7  displaying  the  frequency

dependence,  that  all  results  have  common  features:  peaks  at  low  frequencies

corresponding  to  the  SEPE  process,  minimum  between  0.2  and  0.4  a.u.  due  to

destructive  interferences  between  electronic  and  atomic  amplitudes  and  for  large

frequencies  there  are  resonances  induced  by  the  presence  of  the  Bohr  transitions

between the initial and intermediate states.

 Conclusion

In  this  paper  we  have  extended  our  treatment  of  electron-helium  elastic

collisions in the presence of a linearly and circularly polarized laser field to the case

of  the  excitation.  The  calculations  have  been  performed  by  two  different  methods

both based on the Sturmian basis expansion. Important differences have been found

when we compare the differential cross sections for two laser polarizations (circular
and linear) by using different geometries. In the cases of excitation n1S and n1D, we

have  remarked  that  dressing  effects  are  important  and  dominant,  for  linear
= ,  only  in  the  region  of  small
polarization  and  circular  polarization  with  g

k

scattering angles, while for circular polarization with  g

== 0 , the dressing effects are

important  at  large  scattering  angles.  Our  results  show  that,  everything  else  being
== 0 ) can give larger cross
fixed, a circularly polarized laser (CPP and CPC with  g

sections  than  a  linearly  polarized  one,  by  several  orders  of  magnitude.  This  should

constitute an interesting and attractive point for the experimentalists to measure the

cross section amplitudes in the case of circularly polarized laser beam. New features

have been observed in the case of frequency dependence, indeed, in the case of n = 3

excitation for absorption and n = 2 for emission, intermediate resonnances appear in

the  region  of  small  laser  frequencies,  which  correspond  to  dipole  transitions

interpreted by Simultaneous Electron -Photon Excitation process.

APPENDIX: ENERGY DIAGRAMS CORRESPONDING TO THE

SIMULTANEOUS ELECTRON-PHOTON EXCITATION
OF HELIUM 21S and 31S STATES.

We  interpret  the  resonances  appearing  in  the  region  of  small  frequencies  by

representing  the  energy  diagrams  corresponding  to  these  ‘simultaneous’  electron-

photon  excitation  of  n=2  for  emission  and  n  =  3  for  absorption  in  terms  of

frequencies.  We  consider  the  responsible  quantities  of  these  resonances,  which  are

given (from Eq. 16) by

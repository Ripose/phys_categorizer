We  report  on  the  first  observation  of  “hole”  whispering  gallery  lasers  from 
semiconductor  microcavities  with 
three  dimensional  optical  confinement,  with 
thresholds  potentially  reducible  to  micro-to-nano  ampere  regimes  according  to  a 
quadratic  size-dependent  reduction,  due  to  ideal  quantum  wire  properties  of  the 
naturally formed photonic quantum rings before imminent recombination in a dynamic 
steady state fashion. If the device size grows over a critical diameter, the quantum ring 
whispering  gallery  then  begins  to  disappear.  However,  cooperative  small  hole  arrays 
like  256×256  quantum  ring  emitters  avoid  the  criticality  and  open  a  possibility  of 
constructing  practical  dense  electro-pumped  micro-to-nano  watt  emitter  arrays, 
amenable  to  mega-to-giga  ring  emitter  chip  development  via  present  fabrication 
techniques.

      Lord  Rayleigh's  “concave”  whispering  gallery  (WG)  mode  phenomenon  [1]  has 
triggered 
integration  (LSI)  circuit  research  for 
applications  in  next-generation  photonic  switching  and  interconnect  technologies  to 
remove  the  so  called  electronic  bottleneck,  by  developing  low-threshold  two 
dimensional (2D) whispering gallery mode semiconductor lasers in the last decade [2-5]. 
The  LSI  quest  for  electro-pumped  emitter  arrays  has  also  evolved  into  the  array 
development of 1D vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, for instance the 16×16 array 
work  with  a  limited  performance  due  to  thermal  instabilities  [6].  The  laser  array 
integrations  in  fact  turned  out  to  be  inferior  even  to  earlier  decade-long  efforts  of  the 
quantum well Stark shift modulator LSI developments undertaken since mid 1980s [7]. 
Recent  reviews  on  the  3D  optical  interconnect  technology  now  predict  that  the 

the  optoelectronic 

large-scale 

optoelectronic LSI dream may not be realized for another decade [8], while the current 
electronic  LSI  technology  is  beckoning  to  hit  the  ultimate  quantum  limit  resolutions 
near Bohr radius. To overcome the above bottleneck issues with micro-to-nano ampere 
emitter capabilities, we propose and analyze 3D WG lasers of helix mode, activated by 
recombinant  photonic  quantum  rings  (PQRs)  naturally  generated  in  the  “concave  or 
convex” WG region of active quantum well planes without any artificial etching for the 
ring  definition.  We  have  earlier  reported  on  the  PQR  microresonators  of  concave  3D 
WG modes made of cylindrical mesas, or traditional micropillars with smoothly etched 
sidewalls, fabricated mostly from wafers consisting of a few 80 Å (Al)GaAs quantum 
well  active  planes  between  p-type  top  and  n-type  bottom  GaAs/AlAs  Bragg  reflectors 
for vertical optical confinement [9]. As shown previously these devices exhibit ultralow 
threshold and transparency currents reducible to the micro-to-nano ampere regime, and 
thermal  stabilities  at  operating  temperatures  due  to  T -dependent  quantum  wire 
spectral  shift,  which  are  crucial  for  mega-to-giga  pixel  chip  operations,  and  also 
extendible to nanoemitter developments to enable the bottom-up nanosystem paradigm 
as discussed later. Regarding their nonuniform spectral distributions except the distinct 
multi-family  behavior  that  happens  in  the  device  of  diameter    φ  =  10  µm,  Fig.  1A 
represents  a  family  of  concave  WG  modes  as  a  function  of  active  diameter,  whose 
systematic  variation  of  intermode  spacing  is  consistent  with  a  well-defined  angular 
quantization  rule  for  the  3D  toroidal  cavity  helix  modes  [10].  The  PQR  beam  is 
radiating in 3D but surface-normal dominant fashion unlike the 2D WG lasers. 
 

We  now  demonstrate  that  the  hole  WG  (convex)  modes  are  generated  from 
microresonators of negative mesa (hole) type, fabricated from the same kind of wafers 
[11],  which  then  behave  like  a  bit  fuzzy  PQRs.  Their  spectra  as  shown  in  Fig.  1B 
exhibit weak multi-peaks but clamped to a mode equivalent to concave WG modes of φ 
~ 40 µm without any noticeable cavity-dependent variations, in marked contrast to the 
index-guided concave WG modes. We note that these hole-like PQRs are conceivable 
only for the vertical cavity semiconductor structures, where a carrier gain-guiding factor 
contributing  to  the  3D  hyper  WG  confinement  is  more  dominant.  Although  Fig.  1B 
apparently shows no significant confinements for most helical standing modes, we will 
shortly present a remarkable cooperative confinement effect in the case of dense PQR 
hole emitter arrays [12]. Fig. 1C now summarizes spectra for microhollow (concentric 
hole  and  mesa)  devices  of  different  diameters,  where  the  systematic  variation  of 
intermode spacing is weak again for outer mesas as well as inner holes, while the multi-
peak  resonance  effect  is  now  enhanced  as  the  device  diameter  decreases.  For φ  larger 
than 50 µm in general, in contrast to the concave WG modes deteriorating slightly (Fig. 
1A),  the  inner  hole  WG  resonance  disappears  drastically  and  the  outer  mesa  WG 
resonance  deteriorates  significantly  (Fig.  1C),  indicating  an  intermodal  competition 
between  the  two  apparently  distinctive  hyper  WG  modes.  The  size  related  data 
altogether  indicate  a  presence  of  critical  diameter φc =40  ∼  50  µm  associated  with  the 
gain-guiding  effect  of  hyper  WGs.  The  critical  diameter  φc  will  of  course  vary  for 
different device structures and semiconductor materials other than AlGaAs. 

 

The  CCD  image  of  an  illuminant  PQR  laser  (φ  =15  µm)  and  a  typical  narrowed 
spectrum are shown in Fig. 2A. The circumferential index-guided optical confinement 
of  the  concave  WG  orbits,  together  with  the  two  Bragg  reflectors,  makes  the  3D

recombinant  carriers  in  the  quantum  well  Rayleigh  region.  This  in  turn  exhibits 
thresholds  of  the  micro-ampere  regime  for φ  <  10  ㎛  while  the  transparency  currents 
entering  the  nano-ampere  zone  as  marked  in  yellow  (Fig.  3),  and  the  T -dependent 
thermal  stabilities.  It  is  attributed  to  a  photonic  (de  Broglie)  quantum  corral  effect, 
which  imposes  a  λ  /2  period  concentric  corral-like  transient  ordering  upon  the 
imminently  recombinant  quantum  well  carriers  as  elaborated  further  shortly 
(λ=emission wavelength). 

induces  concentric  PQRs  for 

For the convex WG rings, proton implantation (dosage :1016 cm  -2) steps are often 
added (Fig. 2B) for device isolations in order to confine the majority of the carriers to 
be  funnelled  through  the  un-implanted  annular  regions.  However,  we  now  present  a 
high density cooperative PQR  hole array with no implantation, where the neighboring 
holes surrounding a given hole seem to function as an effective isolation boundary. For 
example, Fig. 2C is a picture of 256×256 hole (φ=8 µm ; pitch=20 µm) arrays we have 
made  so  far  for  a  mega-pixel  laser  chip  development  with  the  implantation  steps 
skipped,  where  the  superbly  uniform  emission  pattern  results  with  0.4-ampere  total 
threshold injection current. An estimate of Ith ~ 6 µA (Itr ~ 2 µA) per hole suggests much 
better effective isolation in average than the implantation (Fig. 3), and it will be worth 
improving  further  by  modern  LSI  fabrication  techniques  and  optimal  designs  of  hole 
pixel size (≤1 µm), appropriately designed periodicity, trench isolation, and so on. 

In  fact  the  above  results  strongly  encourage  us  to  create  dense  cooperative  nanohole 
emitters  with  controlled  periodicity  extending  from  nanometer  to  submicron  length 
scales for mega-to-giga chip developments, which may be a viable road to the practical 
nanotechnology in the future [13]. 

 

 

Fig.  3  now  sums  up  size-dependent  transparency  and  threshold  currents  for  the 
hyper WG lasers of pillar- and hole-type PQRs. Obviously the nano-ampere zone is the 
territory  for  imaginary  nanopillar  and  nanohole  emitters,  although  they  may  not 
necessarily  be  lasers  anymore.  It  also  confirms  that  the  present  proton  implantation 
method  is  not  effective  for  the  carrier  confinement.  In  fact,  the  PQR  holes  fabricated 
inside mesas require far smaller thresholds which are then nearly indistinguishable from 
the regular PQR values. Overall, the quantum ring data are consistent with theoretical 
calculations:  The  transparency  (Itr:curve  T)  and  threshold  (Ith:curve  A)  current 
expressions  for  the  case  of  PQRs  occupying  the  annular  Rayleigh  region  is  given  by

stands  for  internal  loss  [9,  14].  The  overall  yellow  zone  confirms  the  unprecedented 
nano-ampere regime for the PQR nanoemitters, whose fabrications are to be routine and 
reproducible,  although  our  data  are  a  bit  scattered  as  shown  in  Fig.  3  presently.  We 
further  add  that  in  the  case  of  Itr=30~50  nA  device  (φ=6  µm)  prethreshold  chaotic 
phenomena also appear [15]. For smaller φ’s the active volume decreases below 0.1 µm3, 
and with the cavity Q factor over 15,000 [16], the corresponding spontaneous emission

turn-on threshold [2], which often occurs in the PQR light-current analyses. Regarding 
the implant-isolated holes, the wide-spread data suggest a fuzzy ring trend growing as 
the device shrinks due to the growing leaky implantation boundary effect, and the hole 
PQR threshold data are actually approaching the curve B, whose formula is derived for 
the  mesa  by  assuming  that  the  Rayleigh  region  is  now  nothing  but  a  piece  of  annular

Regarding  the  photonic  (de  Broglie)  quantum  corral  effect  imposing  a  λ/2  period 
transient  ordering  upon  the  imminently  recombinant  carriers,  we  recall  a  well-known 
electronic quantum corral image from room temperature scanning tunneling microscope 
studies  of  Au  atomic  island  plane  at  a  given  bias,  although  the  optical  λ/2  period  for 
GaAs semiconductor will be substantially larger than the electronic de Broglie spacing 
[17]. We note that the Rayleigh region of quantum well planes is deeply buried beneath 
a  few  micron  thick  AlAs/GaAs  Bragg  reflectors  not  accessible  for  the  present  surface 
tunneling  analysis.  However,  recent  experiments  and  modeling  work  on  dynamic 
interactions between carriers and transient field in a quantum well plane is a close case 
in point, although the work rather addresses a spatiotemporal transverse migration of the 
transient  light  field  instead  [18].  It  thus  appears  that  the  transient  quantum  wire-like 
features seem to persist within the relevant time scale through thermal fluctuations. For 
an  ensemble  of  carriers  randomly  distributed  in  the  regional  quantum  well  plane  of 
concentration 1012 cm-2 for instance, tens-of-nm scale local field-driven drifts of given 
carriers  to  a  neighboring  imminent  PQR  site  should  generate  the  proposed  PQR 
ordering  for  an  imminent  recombination  event  of  annihilating  electron-hole  pairs  (for 
example the two different Rayleigh rings schematically shown in Fig. 3). We expect the 
standing waves in the Rayleigh region to give rise to a weak potential barrier for such a 
dynamic  electron-hole  pair  process,  perhaps  an  opposite  case  of  extremely  shallow 
quantum well excitons at room temperature [19] where even the shallow barriers tend to 
assure at least one bound state according to square well quantum mechanics. Recent 3D 
polarization measurements of the PQR reveal that the polarization vectors of the surface 
normal  components  lie  always  tangential  to  the  PQR  perimeter  indicating  a  stronger 
carrier-photon coupling when the dynamic carrier distributions are quantum- wire like 
[15]. 
 

On  the  other  hand,  bottom-up  nanowire  device  investigations  such  as  fluidically 
arranged  molecular  crossbars  [20],  and  superlattice  pattern  transferred  molecular 
crossbars [21] were reported recently to realize the next generation nanodevice circuit 
technologies.  In  contrast,  the  lack  of  adequate,  reliable  high-density  nanoemitter  array 
work,  except  a  few  isolated  single  nanoemitter  studies  [22],  appears  to  hold  further 
nanotechnical  developments.  Thus  a  certain  top-down  dense  array  development  of 
emitters  in  nano-ampere  nanometer  regimes  with  controlled  periodicity  is  needed  to 
remove  another  bottleneck  in  implementing  practical  integrated  nanosystems,  esp.  for 
optical interconnects in nanoelectronics. 

 

In  conclusion,  we  have  described  the  hole  PQR  phenomena,  indicating  a  great 
potential  for  creating  a  mega-to-giga-level  interconnect  technology  as  well  as 

intermediate base interconnect nanotechnology for the bottom-up assembly of nanoscale 
electronic and optoelectronic devices. Based upon the additional helix WG behaviours 
like sharp 3D index-guiding we may also imagine an optoelectronic LSI circuitry where 
submicron  scale  ridges  of  helix  WG  waveguides  with  sharp  corners  [15,  23],  and 
appropriate  3D  coupling  angles  and  links  to  coplanar  PQR  emitters  and  receivers,  are 
realizable in practice if we employ a certain quantum well intermixing technology to the 
WG-converted waveguide links [24].

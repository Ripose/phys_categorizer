Abstract: The conceptual evolution of  principle of relativity in the theory of special 
relativity is discussed in detail . It is intimately related to a series of difficulties in 
quantum mechanics, relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory as well as 
to new predictions about antigravity and tachyonic neutrinos etc. 
 

I. 

Introduction: Two Postulates of Einstein 

 
 As is well known, the theory of special relativity(SR) was established by Einstein in 
1905 on two postulates (see,e.g.,[1]): 
Postulate 1: All inertial frames are equivalent with respect to all the laws of physics. 
Postulate 2: The speed of light in empty space always has the same value c. 
The postulate 1 , usually called as the “principle of relativity” , was accepted by all 
physicists in 1905 without suspicion whereas the postulate 2 aroused a great surprise 
among many physicists at that time. 
The surprise was inevitable and even necessary since SR is a totally new theory out 
broken from the classical physics. Both postulates are relativistic in essence and 
intimately related. This is because a law of physics is expressed by certain equation. 
When we compare its form from one inertial frame to another, a coordinate 
transformation is needed to check if its form remains invariant. And this Lorentz 
transformation must be established by the postulate 2 before postulate 1 can have 
quantitative meaning. Hence, as a metaphor, to propose postulate 1 was just like “ to 
paint a dragon on the wall” and Einstein brought it to life “by putting in the pupils of its 
eyes”(before the dragon could fly out of the wall) via the postulate 2[2]. 
  The above understanding explains why all attempts at deriving SR by postulate 1 
solely or by weakening postulate 2 to some extent were doomed to failure. However , to 
combine these two postulates into one is possible only after we can refine the whole 
achievements of physics in the 20th century and the refinement is possible only after we 
gradually understood the deep meaning of SR in the past 100 years. The purpose of this 
paper is focused on the principle of relativity being not only a principle in physics , but 
also a principle in epistemology. These two aspects, however, are indivisible and 
comprise the main clue to understand many difficulties in quantum mechanics(QM) , 
relativistic QM (RQM), quantum field theory(QFT), particle physics and cosmology as 
well.

Lorentz Transformation, Minkowski Diagram and Poincare Group 

Einstein historically and correctly evaluated the great achievement of Newton by a 
remark that J. Wheeler often remembered and repeated, how much Einstein admired 
Newton’s courage and judgment in sticking with the idea of absolute space and time even 
though all Newton’s colleagues told Newton it was absurd. This is because absolute 
space and time was what was required to make progress at Newton’s time ([3],p.146). 
And Einstein clearly knew in 1905 that it was the time to abandon the concept  of 
absolute space and time because “ the justification for a physical concept lies exclusively 
in its clear and unambiguous relation to facts that can be experienced”([1],p.70). 

  In particular, based on his postulate 2, Einstein analyzed  the relativity of simultaneity. 

He  pointed out that an observer A (or B) resting on an inertial frame S(or S’) must have 
his own clock to record the time t (or t’) for a same “event”. In contrast to t=t’ in 
Newtonian mechanics, now in SR they are not only different , but also linked to spatial 
coordinate x (or x’) at which the event occurs:

Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) , together with  y=y’, z=z’, are called the Lorentz transformation , 

which was first written down by Lorentz in 1904. But Einstein discovered it 
independently a year later and ga ve it a totally new and correct explanation. 

 In 1908, Einstein’s teacher, a mathematician H. Minkowski put Eq. (2.1) into a 

diagram with x and t being the abscissa and ordinate of a (rectangular) S frame. Then x’ 
and t’ will become nonrectangular coordinates of S’ frame on that of S frame (see 
e.g.,p.83 of [1]). The important thing is: although an event P has different coordinates (x, 
y, z, t) and (x’, y’, z’, t’) in S and S’ frames, there is a space-time invariant:

In the group theory of  mathematics, all possible transformations capable of preserving 
some invariant will form a group. For example, the rotational group in three dimensional 
Euclidean space is formed by all possible rotations to keep the three dimensional distance 
D invariant:

 Every finite transformation can be reached by the accumulation of infinite infinitesimal 

transformations. In other words, it can be achieved by continuous actions of  
(infinitesimal) generators. For example, the rotational group has three generators which 
just correspond to three angular momentum operators in QM[2]. Of course, Lorentz 
group has extra three generators. Moreover, if taking all inhomogeneous Lorentz

will be discussed further in the next section. 

According to the theory of Poincare group, there are two Casimir invariants commuting 

with all ten generators. One of them is simply  
mass of a particle), i.e.,:

    We will see later that both Minkowski’s point of view (which was highly admired by

Einstein) and Eq. (2.6) are very important to physics. 

 

III.  Observables and Nonobservables 

 
It was often said that SR and QM are two great pillars of modern physics. Undoubtly, 
they are equally important. What will be discussed in this paper is: SR is not only the 
promoter of QM, but also an interpreter of QM. We will discuss the former aspect in this 
and next two sections while the latter one in section VII. 
   In 1926, Einstein attended a lecture on QM (then called the matrix mechanics) by 
Heisenberg in Berlin University. On the way home, they had a conversation as follows:[5] 
Einstein said:” You ignored the orbital motion of electron inside an atom. But the 
electron trajectory can be clearly seen , say, in a cloud chamber. Do you still refuse to 
consider it ?”  He asked again:” Do you truly believe that one can build physical theory 
solely based on observables?”  Heisenberg was astonished and said:” Sir, I just learnt 
from you. Didn’t you insist on doing so in the SR? You taught us not to discuss the 
absolute time but the relative time and the reason why the absolute time is meaningless is 
just because it is unobservable.”  Then Einstein replied:” …In principle, we cannot 
construct the theory solely based on observables. Actually, it is the theory which 
determines what we can observe.” 
  The above conversation between Einstein and Heisenberg is really very interesting and 
important. They pushed the principle of relativity in SR into a deeper level of 
epistemology . What essential in their discussion is: an absolute thing is unobservable, 
but we still need nonobservables to establish a theory which in turn tells us what will be 
seen in real experiments. 
 The development of physics in the 20th century reveals that a transformation of 
nonobservable will lead to a relevant conservation law (or selection rule) for an

observable as summarized by T.D.Lee [6]. For instance, the absolute time t (or absolute 
position in space, x) is unobservable, so we can perform a time (space) translation: 
 
at our disposal without changing the law of physics. This invariance under the time 
(space) translation leads to the energy E  (momentum p) conservation law. Both  E and p 
are observables.  In QM, their relations are expressed ( in one dimensional space only)as:

(3.2) 

which are just the corresponding generators of spase-time  translational group with 
Plank constant   h  as their  common multipliers. The deep implication of (3.2) lies in the 
fact that coordinates x and t  in the wave function(WF) of QM are not direct observables 
and the momentum p and energy E are observable only in the sense of  operators, which 
means that p and E are unobservable until some action is performed on the quantum 
system(say, a particle) . In other words, one has to push the particle along the x axis (or 
along t) a little bit before the information of p (or E) can be created. In short , no change, 
no information. This is just because an absolute thing is transformed into a relative thing 
only during the changing process.  
 Even Dirac, one of the great founders of QM, had at one time (1927) overlooked the 
above principle. He introduced a Hermitian operator  fˆ  for the “phase” of photon field 

 

 

 

 

i

]N,[

and established its commutation relation with the photon number operator 
 
 
But it is essentially wrong. Just like the absolute time t, an absolute phase (angle)      
cannot be a Hermitian operator corresponding to an observable. Only a relative angle, i.e., 
a phase difference, can be observable. Then two (not one) Hermitian operators for phase 
were introduced correctly by Susskind and Glogower(see [7] and section 1,6D in [2]), 
just like a motto in Chinese philosophy saying: “The ‘one’ is invisible until ‘two’ are 
established”.

IV.  Negative Energy and Antiparticle

In his second short paper establishing SR, Einstein proposed the greatest equation 
changing the world: 
 
(4.1) 
E =
which has been verified by all experiments. Here both energy E and mass m  are 
measured to be positive. 
However, in 1928, aiming at combining SR with QM, Dirac  discovered an equation for 
electron, which not only explained the electron spin , but also predicted the existence of 
its antiparticle , the positron ( discovered by Anderson in 1932) ,by showing that  the 
energy E can be negative ,e.g., in the case of free motion:

om is the rest mass of particle.  Similar negative energy was also found  in the 

where 
Klein-Gordon (KG) equation for spinless particles. The reason why the negative energy 
emerges in QM is because in the WF of particle: 
 
px
only one set of operator formula (3.2) was used to get (4.2).  In order to explain the 
existence of positron with positive energy, many physicists resorted to a “hole theory” 
based on the “sea” filling up by “negative-energy electrons” , which actually has no 
guarantee from the Pauli exclusion principle, let alone the KG particles. Only a few 
physicists, like Schwinge r[8], Konopinski and Mahmaud[9], even earlier but implicitly, 
Feynman[10] and Stueckelberg[11],pointed out the necessity of using :

for antiparticles (denoted  by subscript c ) as the counterpart of (3.2) for particles. Eq. 
(4.4) means that once E<0 in (4.3) , we should write the WF for an antiparticle as: 
 
  
In  a long review article by Lee and Wu[12], they defined correctly the antiparticle state  
a  being  the CPT transformation of its particle state   a    : 

(x, t ) ~ exp [- i (p  x  - E  t)/ h ]

 (4.7) 

a = CPT  a   

 
to replace the original one  
a = C a  
 
which was already proven to be wrong after the discovery of parity (P) violation in 
weak interactions in 1956-1957. Expressing (4.6) in terms of WF, we easily obtain (4,5) 
for either Dirac or KG particles (see [13] apart from some irrelevant matrix prefactor). 
Some remarks are in order: 
(a). Why (4.7) is wrong ?  Many physicists believed that the distinction between 
electron and positron is absolute----they carry opposite “ intrinsic charge”  -e and e (e>0) 
and there is a “ conservation law of charge q” expressed as a continuity equation which 
was used by Maxwell to introduce the “displacement current”  for establishing the theory 
of classical electrodynamics(CED) . However, the conservation law of charge is no 
longer valid since the experimental discovery of the variation of fine-structure constant  
=a
 increasing from 1/137 at low energy to 1/128 at high energy ( for theoretical 
explanation ,see [14]) . And the continuity equation in CED is already substituted by its 
counterpart in QM without the appearance of a charge unit e[2]. So the conservation law 
of charge is already substituted by that of charge number Q = q / e, e.g., Q = - 1 and 1 for 
electron and positron as reflected in the distinction between i and - i in the WF (4.3) 
versus (4.5). The distinction between them is merely relative in the phase of space-time 
evolution, not an absolute one in some “ intrinsic space”.

 -t) without complex conjugation,( which is violated to 100% in nonrelativistic QM) 

by Eq. (4.3), just implying a reversal of motion.  Hence the name “time reversal (T)”  is 
indeed a misnomer and its tiny violation (i.e., CP violation) discovered in weak 
interactions since 1964 has nothing to do with the symmetry of pure time inversion  
(t ﬁ
or the symmetry between particle and antiparticle. The latter symmetry is ensured by the 
CPT theorem as shown in (4, 6). But actually, the CPT theorem already becomes a 
postulate which can be stated as follows: 
 Under the (newly defined ) space-time inversion  P T  (x ﬁ
relativistic QM (RQM) remains invariant while a concrete state of particle transforms 
into that of its antiparticle : 
 
 
where C means the particle –antiparticle  transformation , whose definition is contained 
in the postulate (4.10), not coming from else where. 
(c). The above situation bears some resemblance to what happened in classical physics. 
The definition of inertial mass of a body, m, is just given by the ratio of force F to 
acceleration a , i.e., by the Newton’s law: 
 
 
 
Similarly, the definition of electric (magnetic) field strength 
law of Lorentz force: 
r
r
r
=
 
 
amF
(
A law (postulate) can often ( not always) accommodate a definition of physical quantity 
and the validity of law together with the definition has to be verified by experiments, not 
by the theory coming from else where. This is the method of induction. By contrast, all 
quantities in a theorem must be defined independently in advance and the outcome 
deduced from the theorem is actually hidden in its premise. However, although CPT 
theorem has been tested by experiments, once the conservation laws of C, P, and T are 
discovered to be violated individually, their definitions cease to be meaningful in physics. 
We should change the definition of space-time inversion into PT   and regard the particle-
antiparticle transformation C  not an independent one but a direct consequence of  PT   as  
shown in (4.10). The relation between (4.3) and (4.5), or that between (3.2) and (4.4), is 
just what (4.10) means.  Eq.(4.10) is also a starting point of QFT, e.g., it gives the exact 
definition of a field operator [2,36].We have been waiting for the conception change for 
too long a time.

V.  Negative mass paradox, Invariance of mass inversion and 

Antigravity 

 
   If we insist on Eq. (4.1) and emphasize the inevitable appearance of negative energy in 
RQM, we must consider the negative mass as well. Interesting enough, a possible 
negative gravitational mass had been discussed by Bondi[16], Schiff[17] and Will[18].

1m whereas  

1m  would repel 

2m  .The pair ( a 

2m would attract 

and Eq. (4.11), 
“ gravitational dipole”)  would accelerate automatically in space, a bizarre phenomenon 
that no one can believe and so it could be named as a “negative mass paradox” in 
gravity[19].                     
    To get rid of this paradox once and for all, we should notice that in previous sections 
the distinction between (x, t) and ( - x, -t ) , or that between E and – E , is merely relative 
in the sense of symmetry transformation to show the equal existence of particle versus 
antiparticle. Eventually, there is no negative energy at all. Hence, to keep (4.1) intact, we 
must treat the mass inversion m (cid:224) - m  also as a symmetry transformation to reflect the 
particle-antiparticle symmetry and eventually , there  is no negative mass at all . Indeed, 
the theory of RQM does remain invariant under the mass inversion and it can be 
generalized to a classical theory. For example, a mass inversion (replacing the 
transformation q (cid:224) – q) performed on Eq.(4.12) can bring the equation for electron into 
that for positron.  Similarly, Eq. (5.1) should be generalized to:

so that it can remain invariant under the mass inversion
. Eq. (5.2) 
implies attractive force between matters (antimatters) whereas repulsive force between 
matter and antimatter. 
 Of course, Eq. (5.2) is still a postulate or conjecture and should be subject to tests in 
cosmology. But it seems much simpler than the hypothesis of so-called “dark energy” to 
account for the acceleration of universe expansion.[19].

Since the discovery of parity vio lation by Lee-Yang[20] and Wu et al.[21] in 1956-1957 
as well as the genius  experiment by Goldhaber et al.[22], the permanent helicity of 
neutrino (antineutrino) being left- handed ( right- handed) has been verified beyond any 
doubt, especially because it was assumed that neutrinos have zero mass and move at a 
speed of light c. However, the experimental verification of neutrino oscillation (among 
three flavors
2002[24] had excluded any possibility of a massless neutrino. Meanwhile, the 
measurements on tritium beta decay gave a remarkable result that in the kinematical

data [24], etc. Moreover, it may explain the appearance of so-called two “knees” in the

VII.  Implication of Wave-function in Quantum Mechanics 

Despite the great success of SR, QM and quantum field theory (QFT), they are still not 
so satisfying. The situation was described by Dirac as follows[28]: 
“ It would seem that we have followed as far as possible the path of logical development 
of the idea of QM as they are at present understood. The difficulties , being of a profound 
character, can be removed only by some drastic change in the foundations of the theory, 
probably a change as drastic as the passage from Bohr’s orbit theory to the present QM.” 
 In 1964, in his lecture at Cornell University, Feynman said:”…I think I can safely say 
that nobody understands QM….” [29]. 
  Why QM is so difficult to understand? Where is the clue? 
  Dirac had said that before 1972 he thought the commutation relation in QM being the 
most subtle thing. After 1972, he changed his mind and thought that it is the 
wavefunction (WF) being the most subtle thing which contains i and thus is unobservable. 
  We agree with Dirac’s opinion that i enters QM essentially  and the main difficulties of 
QM are focused on WF. Let us look at WFs (4.3) vs. (4.5) [or (6.7) vs. (6.8) ], there are 
“ observables” p and E hiding in unobservable WFs. What do they mean? 
  First of all, we should emphasize a radical difference between eastern and western 
philosophy. In western world, the main stream philosophy was represented by 
Democritus (460-370 BC) . He said :” Nothing exists except atoms and empty space, 
every thing else is opinion.” [30]. His thought played an important role in promoting the 
science progress in the past 500 years. In the same period, eastern philosophy posed 
nearly no considerate influence on the science progress  because it didn’t address the 
right proble m at the right time. However, it’s time for eastern philosophy to contribute 
something meaningful to physics. 
  In the opening line of his “ Tao Te Ching “ , Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said :” The 
Tao that can be expressed is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the 
permanent name.”[31] Here the “Tao” means ‘way’, ‘reality’ or ‘law’ and the name that 
can be named refers to a concrete thing that can be put into certain category. Similarly, it 
was quoted from the Indian philosophy book Upanishads that[31]: 
                There the eye goes not, 
                Speech goes not, nor the mind. 
                We know not , we understand not. 
                How one would teach it? 
Combing the above idea with Kant’s philosophy in the end of 18th century, we may say 
that an object remains as a “thing in itself” which contains no information until it is 
observed and transformed into “thing for us “ which is often called the phenomena 
containing various information ( position x, momentum p and energy E ,etc.) A 
measurement on the object implies an operation, i.e., a changing on it. The information is 
created just during the changing, not before. This is why a physical quantity ( say, p ) in 

classical physics becomes an operator (say, 

h
i

)  in QM.

Then how can we predict what will happen before we perform a real measurement on an 
object? It is just at this crucial point , the principle of relativity of SR evolves into a 
principle of relativity in epistemology which can be stated as follows: 
  A thing can only be cognized during its motion and change relative to others. If 
isolated from its opposite, it would be bound to become absolute and mysterious object 
devoid of any understanding. 
 Say, for a particle, what are its opposites? Among them  (the environment, apparatus, 
etc), the most important one is just the subject---we human being as the observer. 
Following Dirac, we denote the abstract particle state by   y  which has no 
representation (no information) . If we wish to predict the outcome of a position x 
measurement, we introduce a basis vector 
as :

as a “fictitious apparatus” for measuring the 
Physically, we may understand   
position of particle at point x and time t. Both x and t belong to “apparatus”(not  to 
particle). Then why WF (7.1) is expressed as a field like (4.3) or (4.5) : 
kx

i
At this next crucial point, the philosophy initiated by Lao Tzu and Greek philosopher 
Herakleitos (~500 BC) came to help. Essentially, every thing is by no means composed 
from indivisible particles but always contains two opposite sides  as shown via the real 
and imaginary parts (both real ) divided by i . However, we have to be cautious not to 
regard the distinction of these two sides (called “ying” and “yang” in Chinese philosophy) 
being realistic or absolute. Their distinction is merely abstract and relative. One may 
perform a phase transformation on the WF to see ying and yang changing each other 
immediately at one’s disposal. However, the distinction is sharp enough so that a relative 
sign change between them in (7.2) amounts to a change from particle to antiparticle. 
Therefore, to simulate an interaction  (contradiction)  between the object  y  and the 

(7.2) 

 

tx,

 , the WF reflects a possibility of “fictitious measurement”. 

“fictitious apparatus”
Following Herbert’s suggestion that the WF is a “possibility wave” [32] rather than 
“matter wave”, we can understand what Born’s  probability interpretation of WF means 
is : 
      real  probability  = 

WF =

 The word “potential” is used to stress the invisibility of WF, also the flexibility of the 
choice of basis vector. For example, we can choose another “fictitious apparatus for 
measuring the momentum p”,
=

, to express the WF of  y  as :

For a same y , we can  find several WFs with different representations. Similar 
experience was familiar to mathematicians like Minkowski  as discussed in section II. An 
r
elementary example is an abstract vector in Euclidean space, V
geometrical object without any number attached to it. In order to describe it concretely,

We should notice the resemblance of (7.1) and (7.4) to (7.5) and learn from 
mathematicians that the existence of an object and its representation are linked together 
but they are two different things.  
   Einstein was correct to say that “it is the theory which determines what we can 
observe”. Let us write the Dirac equation in two –component  spinor form:

Two things need to be emphasized: First, as a simple linear transformation (7.8) can 

alter the meaning of WF drastically---- from hidden particle and antiparticle fields to 
hidden left and right handed chiral fields, we should not interpret the WF too materially.

most subtle thing in QM. 

VIII.  Divergence Difficulty in Quantum Field Theory 

 
  Since the quantum theory evolved from QM to the realm of Quantum field theory (QFT), 
various divergences have been bothering physicists a lot. [28]. It was thought tha t the 
divergence might stem from the “point-particle model” of QM. However, as discussed in 
previous sections, there is no point particle in QM. So the divergence has nothing to do 
with the “point-particle model” at all. 
   Beginning from a simple regularization-renormalization method (RRM) proposed by 
J.F.Yang (then a PhD candidate in 1994 [33]) , we have been getting rid of all 
divergences, counter terms, bare parameters and arbitrary running mass scale  (after some 
other RRM) in QFT [14]. What we eventua lly realize is that we were overlooking again 
the principle of relativity stressed by Einstein.  How can we calculate or even merely 
modify, say, an electron mass on its mass shell solely via finite loop evaluation?  No, we 
can’t. What we can understand is either no mass scale or two mass scales, but never one 
mass scale. This scenario was clearly shown in the Gross-Neveu model [34]. So the 
appearance of divergence is essentially a warning  that we expected too much in doing 
calculation on perturbative QFT . What we can do is to substitute divergences by some 
arbitrary constants and then the renormalization amounts to fix these constants by 
experiments, say, to reconfirm  the value of mass on its mass shell before we can predict 
what will happen in the off- mass-shell situation and go to the next higher loop calculation. 
As a metaphor, one has to reconfirm the plane ticket before his departure from the airport, 
he must use the same name through out his whole journey[14]. 

By adopting the new RRM, our calculation on QFT becomes more predictive and free 

of ambiguity. For instance, based on the standard model of particle physics and the 
accurate experimental data of masses of W and Z bosons as well as the value of 
Weinberg angle, we were able to predict the Higgs ma ss being around 138 GeV/c2 ( not a 
lower or upper bound)[35], which should be tested experimentally in the years to come. 

 

 

IX.  Summary and Discussion 

 
(a). We have been learning from SR that the essence of the principle of relativity is 
nothing but the equal existence of particle and antiparticle. To be precise, every particle 
has two contradictory fields,  j and c , and the theory must obey the symmetry of space-
time inversion like (7.7) with Eqs.(3.2) versus (4.4). This is the only one “relativistic 

 

12 

postulate” (in one inertial frame) which would arouse the surprise of physicists living in 
1905 to the same degree just like the postulate of constancy of light speed did. 
 
(b). An alternative statement is: a theory , either quantum or classical, capable of treating 
particle and antiparticle on an equal footing should be invariant under the mass inversion 
m(cid:224) - m.  
(c). In fact, the above two equivalent symmetries are combined in the Casimir invariant 
(2.6). Just like the four-dimensional space-time interval (2.3) can be positive, zero or 
negative, now in the four-dimensional momentum space:

 is possible, so does 

can  also be positive, zero or negative. In the last case, as shown in (6.2), we will get a 
tachyonic neutrino. However, while 
, which 
im
means an antineutrino. Hence we see again that the mass inversion is indeed a symmetry 
transformation between  i and – i ,which  of course is a relative one , rather than an 
absolute one. 
(d). In some sense, we may regard the two sets of operators, (3.2) and (4.4), as the DNA 
inherited by RQM, QFT and particle physics from QM and SR respectively[36,2]. 
(e).The principle of relativity is so deep and subtle that even Einstein himself had 
struggled for eight years before he invented the theory of general relativity on the basis of 
SR. What Einstein eventually realized is that space and time have no absolute meaning 
but systems of relations ([3],p.149). 
We wish to add that the conception of time is essentially endowed by the observer (not 
by the object) as shown in the expression of WF (7.1) in QM. We build our concept of 
time t on experiences to observe a chain of events----from a cause to an effect, then a next 
effect, and on and on. So the time evolves always forward and never backward, a 
cognition which is totally in conformity with the positiveness  of mass and energy, also 
the fact that we are composed of Dirac particles violating the pure time inversion to 
maximum as discussed in section VII.  In other words, we always have a “arrow of time” 
not only on the macroscopic level as explicitly shown by the second law of 
thermodynamics , but also on the microscopic level implicitly as well. 
 (f). In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) wrote a seminal paper titled “ Can 
quantum mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?”[Phys. 
47 , 777, (1935)]  which has two far-reaching consequences.  First, its original 
Rev.

version actually infers the necessity of introducing antiparticles to QM and fixes their 
operators as (4.4) [37, 2]. Second, equally importantly, it opened a fast developing field 
of physics---- the Bell’s inequality [38] and its tests in various EPR experiments, 
especially that by Aspect et al[39], Weihs et al[40], Tittel et al[41] and the CPLEAR 
Collaboration[42] etc, showing the entanglement of quantum states. One common 
conclusion can be drawn from these experiments is: the concrete form of correlation in a 
quantum state exhibits itself as a direct outcome of measurement right at the destruction 
of original entanglement of state. If taking further the strong hints by the  remarkable 
“which-way” experiment [43] and SQUID experiment [44] into account, we may claim 
with confidence that the information does not exist in an object before the measurement, 
rather, it is created by subject and object in common during the measurement which is 
nothing but a changing process on the object.

(g). In short, we might summarize the above discussion by one English letter: “i” versus 
“I”. The symmetry between i and –i implies the common essence of QM and SR, 
(without (4.4) provided by SR, QM cannot be regarded as complete). On the other hand, 
“I” means information, also represents the subject. Nonetheless, all descriptions on the 
objective world, including the theory of SR, the introduction of i and WF into QM  etc, 
are all innovations of human being . After 1935, Einstein kept asking that “Is the moon 
there when nobody looks?”[45] It’s time to answer this question now [2].

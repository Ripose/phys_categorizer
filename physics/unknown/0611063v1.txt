We  investigate  whether,  and  to  what  extent,  the  physical  phenomenon  of  long-
lifetime  resonant  electromagnetic  states  with  localized  slowly-evanescent  field 
patterns  can  be  used  to  transfer  energy  efficiently,  even  in  the  presence  of 
extraneous environmental objects. Via detailed theoretical and numerical analyses 
of  typical  real-world  model-situations  and  realistic  material  parameters,  we 
establish that such a non-radiative scheme could indeed be practical for medium-
range wireless energy transfer. 

I. Introduction 

In  the  early  days  of  electromagnetism,  before  the  electrical-wire  grid  was  deployed, 

serious  interest  and  effort  was  devoted  (most  notably  by  Nikola  Tesla  [1])  towards  the 

development  of  schemes  to  transport  energy  over  long  distances  without  any  carrier  medium 

(e.g. wirelessly). These efforts appear to have met with little, if any, success. Radiative modes of 

omni-directional  antennas  (which  work  very  well  for  information  transfer)  are  not  suitable  for 

such  energy  transfer,  because  a  vast  majority  of  energy  is  wasted  into  free  space.  Directed 

radiation  modes,  using  lasers  or  highly-directional  antennas,  can  be  efficiently  used  for  energy 

transfer, even for long distances (transfer distance LTRANS»LDEV, where LDEV is the characteristic 

size  of  the  device),  but  require  existence  of  an  uninterruptible  line-of-sight  and  a  complicated 

tracking system in the case of mobile objects. Rapid development of autonomous electronics of 

recent  years  (e.g.  laptops,  cell-phones,  house-hold  robots,  that  all  typically  rely  on  chemical 

energy  storage)  justifies  revisiting  investigation  of  this  issue.  Today,  we  face  a  different 

challenge  than  Tesla:  since  the  existing  electrical-wire  grid  carries  energy  almost  everywhere, 

even a medium-range wireless energy transfer would be quite useful. One scheme currently used 

 

1

for  some  important  applications  relies  on  induction,  but  it  is  restricted  to  very  close-range 

(LTRANS«LDEV)  energy  transfers  [2,3,4,5].  In  contrast  to  the  currently  existing  schemes,  we 

investigate  the  feasibility  of  using  long-lived  oscillatory  resonant  electromagnetic  modes,  with 

localized slowly evanescent field patterns, for wireless non-radiative energy transfer. The basis 

of  this  method  is  that  two  same-frequency  resonant  objects  tend  to  couple,  while  interacting 

weakly  with  other  off-resonant  environmental  objects.  The  purpose  of  the  present  paper  is  to 

quantify  this  mechanism  using  specific  examples,  namely  quantitatively  address  the  following 

questions:  up  to  which  distances  can  such  a  scheme  be  efficient  and  how  sensitive  is  it  to 

external  perturbations?  Our  detailed  theoretical  and  numerical  analysis  show  that  a  mid-range 

(LTRANS ≈  few∗LDEV)  wireless  energy-exchange  can  actually  be  achieved,  while  suffering  only 

modest  transfer  and  dissipation  of  energy  into  other  off-resonant  objects.  The  omnidirectional 

but  stationary  (non-lossy)  nature  of  the  near  field  makes  this  mechanism  suitable  for  mobile 

wireless  receivers.  It  could  therefore  have  a  variety  of  possible  applications  including  for 

example, placing a source (connected to the wired electricity network) on the ceiling of a factory 

room, while devices (robots, vehicles, computers, or similar) are roaming freely within the room. 

Other possible applications include electric-engine buses, RFIDs, and perhaps even nano-robots. 

II. Range and rate of coupling 

The range and rate of the proposed wireless energy-transfer scheme are the first subjects 

of examination, without considering yet energy drainage from the system for use into work. An 

appropriate  analytical  framework  for  modeling  this  resonant  energy-exchange  is  that  of 

“coupled-mode theory” [6]. In this picture, the field of the system of two resonant objects 1 and 

2 is approximated by F(r,t)≈ a1(t)F1(r)+a2(t)F2(r), where F1,2(r) are the eigenmodes of 1 and 2 

alone, and then the field amplitudes a1(t) and a2(t) can be shown [6] to satisfy, to lowest order:

where ω1,2 are the individual eigenfrequencies, Γ1,2 are the resonance widths due to the objects’ 

intrinsic (absorption, radiation etc.) losses, and κ is the coupling coefficient. Eqs.(1) show that at 

exact resonance (ω1=ω2 and Γ1=Γ2), the eigenmodes of the combined system are split by 2κ; the 

energy exchange between the two objects takes place in time  /π κ  and is nearly perfect, apart 

for losses, which are minimal when the coupling rate is much faster than all loss rates (κ»Γ1,2).† It 

is  exactly  this  ratio 

/κ

Γ Γ   that  we  will  set  as  our  figure-of-merit  for  any  system  under 

1 2

consideration for wireless energy-transfer, along with the distance over which this ratio can be 
achieved.‡ 

Therefore,  our  non-radiative-coupling  application  requires  resonant  modes  of  high 

Q=ω/2Γ for low (slow) intrinsic-loss rates Γ and with evanescent tails significantly longer than 

the  characteristic  sizes  of  the  objects  for  strong  (fast)  near-field-coupling  rate  κ  over  large 

distances. This is a regime of operation that has not been studied extensively, since one usually 

prefers short tails to minimize interference with nearby devices. Unfortunately, the radiation Q 

usually decreases along with the resonator size, so the above characteristics can only be achieved 

using resonant objects of finite subwavelength size for large relative extent of the non-radiative 

near field (set typically by the wavelength and quantified rigorously by the “radiation caustic”) 

into  the  surrounding  air.  Such  subwavelength  resonances  are  often  accompanied  with  a  high 

radiation  Q,  so  this  will  typically  be  the  appropriate  choice  for  the  possibly-mobile  resonant 

device-object  d .  Note,  though,  that  the  resonant  source-object  s   will  in  practice  often  be 

immobile  and  with  less  stringent  restrictions  on  its  allowed  geometry  and  size,  which  can  be 

therefore  chosen  large  enough  so  that  its  radiative  losses  are  negligible  (using  for  example 

waveguides with guided modes tuned close to the “light line” in air for slow exponential decay 

therein). 

The  proposed  scheme  is  very  general  and  any  type  of  resonant  structure  (e.g. 

electromagnetic,  acoustic,  nuclear)  satisfying  the  above  requirements  can  be  used  for  its 

                                                 
† The limits of validity of the coupled-mode-theory model include this optimal regime of operation, since the weak-
coupling condition κ«ω1,2 also holds for medium-distance coupling, and thus the use of this model is justified and 
the parameters κ, Γ1,2 are well defined. 
‡ Note that interference effects (not captured by coupled-mode theory) between the radiation fields of the two initial 
single-object  modes  result  in  radiation-Γ’s  for  the  eigenmodes  of  the  system  that  are  different  than  but 
approximately average to the initial single-object radiation-Γ’s.

implementation. As examples and for definiteness, we choose to work with two well-known, but 

quite  different,  electromagnetic  resonant  systems:  dielectric  disks  and  capacitively-loaded 

conducting-wire  loops.  Even  without  optimization,  and  despite  their  simplicity,  both  will  be 

shown to exhibit acceptably good performance. 

a) Dielectric disks 

Consider a 2D dielectric disk resonant object of radius r and permittivity ε surrounded by 

air  that  supports  high-Q  whispering-gallery  modes  (Figure  1).  All  subsequent  calculations  for 

this type of resonant disks were performed using numerical finite-difference frequency-domain 

(FDFD) mode-solver simulations (with a resolution of 30pts/r), but analytical methods were also 

used, when applicable, to verify the results. 

The  loss  mechanisms  for  the  energy  stored  inside  such  a  resonant  system  are  radiation 

into  free  space  and  absorption  inside  the  potentially  lossy  disk  material.  High-radiation-Q  and 

long-tailed  subwavelength  resonances  can  be  achieved,  when  the  dielectric  permittivity  ε  is  as 

large as practically possible and the azimuthal field variations (of principal number m) are slow 

(namely  m  is  small).  Two  such  TE-polarized  dielectric-disk  modes  with  the  favorable 

characteristics

Figure 1: Numerical FDFD results for a 2D high-ε disk of radius r along with the electric field (pointing out of the 
page)  of  its  resonant  whispering-gallery  mode.§  [Side  plot:  shape  of  the  modal  field.  In  air,  it  follows  a  Hankel-
function form: note the initial exponential-like regime (with long tails compared to the small disk size), followed by 
the  oscillatory/radiation  regime  (whose  presence  means  that  energy  is  slowly  leaking  out  of  the  disk).]  For  the 
tabulated  results  material  loss  Im{ε}/Re{ε}=10-4  has  been  used.  {The  specific  parameters  of  the  shown  plot  are 
highlighted with bold in the Table.} 
 

Note that the required values of ε, shown in Figure 1, might at first seem unrealistically 

large.  However,  not  only  are  there  in  the  microwave  regime  (appropriate  for  meter-range 

coupling applications) many materials that have both reasonably high enough dielectric constants 

and low losses (e.g. Titania: ε ≈ 96, Im{ε}/ε ≈ 10-3; Barium tetratitanate: ε ≈ 37, Im{ε}/ε ≈ 10-4; 

Lithium tantalite: ε ≈ 40, Im{ε}/ε ≈ 10-4; etc.) [7,8], but also ε could signify instead the effective 

index of other known subwavelength (

rλ (cid:21) ) surface-wave systems, such as surface-plasmon 

1

/

modes on surfaces of metal-like (negative-ε) materials [9] or metallo-dielectric photonic crystals 

[10]. 

 

To  calculate  now  the  achievable  rate  of  energy  transfer,  we  place  two  same  disks  at 

distance D between their centers (Figure 2). The FDFD mode-solver simulations give κ through 

the  frequency  splitting  of  the  normal  modes  of  the  combined  system,  which  are  even  and  odd 

                                                 
§ Note that for the 3D case the computational complexity would be immensely increased, while the physics should 
not be significantly different. For example, a spherical object of ε=147.7 has a whispering gallery mode with m=2, 
Qrad=13962, and λ/r=17.

Losses in this resonant system consist of ohmic loss inside the wire and radiative loss into

It is important to appreciate the difference between this inductive scheme and the well-

known  close-range  inductive  schemes  for  energy  transfer  [2]  in  that  those  schemes  are  non-

resonant.  Using  coupled-mode  theory  it  is  easy  to  show  that,  keeping  the  geometry  and  the 

energy stored at the source fixed, the presently proposed resonant-coupling inductive mechanism 
allows for ~Q2 (~106) times more power delivered for work at the mid-range distant device than 

the  traditional  non-resonant  mechanism,  and  this  is  why  mid-range  energy  transfer  is  now 

possible.  Capacitively-loaded  conductive  loops  are  actually  being  widely  used  as  resonant 

antennas (for example in cell phones), but those operate in the far-field regime with D/r»1, r/λ~1, 

and the radiation Q’s are intentionally designed to be small to make the antenna efficient, so they 

are not appropriate for energy transfer.

III. Influence of extraneous objects 

Clearly,  the  success  of  the  proposed  resonance-based  wireless  energy-transfer  scheme 

depends strongly on the robustness of the objects’ resonances. Therefore, their sensitivity to the 

near  presence  of  random  non-resonant  extraneous  objects  is  another  aspect  of  the  proposed 

scheme  that  requires  analysis.  The  appropriate  analytical  model  now  is  that  of  “perturbation 

theory”  [6],  which  suggests  that  in  the  presence  of  an  extraneous  object  e   the  field  amplitude 

a1(t) inside the resonant object 1 satisfies, to first order:

where again ω1 is the frequency and

to  e  (absorption inside  e , scattering from  e  etc.) loss rate**. The frequency shift is a problem 

 is the extrinsic due

that can be “fixed” rather easily by applying to every device a feedback mechanism that corrects 

its  frequency  (e.g.  through  small  changes  in  geometry)  and  matches  it  to  that  of  the  source. 

However, the extrinsic loss can be detrimental to the functionality of the energy-transfer scheme,

a) Dielectric disks 

In the first example of resonant objects that we have considered, namely dielectric disks, 

small,  low-index,  low-material-loss  or  far-away  stray  objects  will  induce  small  scattering  and 

absorption.  In  such  cases  of  small  perturbations  these  extrinsic  loss  mechanisms  can  be 

quantified 

using 

respectively 

the 

analytic 

first-order 

formulas 

                                                 
**  The  first-order  perturbation-theory  model  is  really  only  valid  for  small  perturbations.  However,  the  parameters 
 are still well defined, if  1a  is taken to be the amplitude of the exact perturbed mode. 
11 eκ − , 
†† Note that interference effects between the radiation field of the initial resonant-object mode and the field scattered 
1eΓ ’s that are 
off the extraneous object can for strong scattering (e.g. off metallic objects) result in total radiation-

1 e−Γ

smaller than the initial radiation-

1Γ  (namely 

1 e−Γ

 is negative!), as will be seen in the examples.

  and  depends  linearly  on  the  field

field tails, coupling to other resonant objects should be much faster than all extrinsic loss rates

be sturdy for this class of resonant dielectric disks. 

However, we also want to examine certain possible situations where extraneous objects 

cause perturbations too strong to analyze using the above first-order perturbative approach. For 

example,  we  place  a  dielectric  disk  c   close  to  another  off-resonance  object  of  large

Figure 4: Numerical FDFD results for reduction in Q  of a resonant disk due to scattering from and absorption in 
extraneous  objects:  (a)  a  high ε=49+16i  (which  is  large  but  actually  appropriate  for  human  muscles  in  the  GHz 
regime  [13])  square  object  of  same  size  (area)  with  the  disk,  and  (b)  a  large  roughened  surface  of ε=2.5+0.05i 
(appropriate for ordinary materials such as concrete, glass, plastic, wood [13]).For the tabulated results disk material 
loss Im{ε}/Re{ε}=10-4 was used and the mode that is odd with respect to the line that connects the two objects. An 
increase in radiation Q  is again due to destructive interference effects. {The specific parameters of the shown plots 
are highlighted with bold in the Tables.} 
 

To examine the influence of large perturbations on an entire energy-transfer system we 

consider two resonant disks in the close presence of both a “human” and a “wall”. The numerical

Figure 5: Numerical FDFD results for reduction in 
Γ Γ  of medium-distance coupling between two resonant 
disks due to scattering from and absorption in extraneous objects: both a high ε=49+16i square object of same size 
(area) with the disks and a large roughened surface of ε=2.5+0.05i. If initially all the energy is in one disk, after 
some time (t=π/2κ) both disks are equally excited to one of the normal modes of their combined system, while little 
energy has been lost due to the nearby extraneous objects. For the tabulated results the normal mode that is odd with 
respect  to  the  line  that  connects  the  two  disks  is  used,  only  distances  for  non-radiative  (
)  coupling  are 
considered, and the  Γ ’s are taken to be the averages of the corresponding calculated  Γ ’s of the two normal modes, 
where  an  increase/decrease  in  radiation  Q   for  the  system  is  due  to  destructive/constructive  interference  effects.

b) Capacitively-loaded conducting-wire loops 

In the second example of resonant objects that we have considered, the conducting-wire 

loops, the influence of extraneous objects on the resonances is nearly absent. The reason is that, 

in  the  quasi-static  regime  of  operation  (r«λ)  that  we  are  considering,  the  near  field  in  the  air 

region surrounding the loop is predominantly magnetic (since the electric field is localized inside 

12

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  capacitor),  therefore  extraneous  objects  e   that  could  interact  with  this  field  and  act  as  a 

perturbation  to  the  resonance  are  those  having  significant  magnetic  properties  (magnetic 

permeability Re{μ}>1 or magnetic loss Im{μ}>0). Since almost all common materials are non-

magnetic,  they  respond  to  magnetic  fields  in  the  same  way  as  free  space,  and  thus  will  not 

disturb  the  resonance  of  a  conducting-wire  loop,  so  we  expect

. 

The  only  perturbation  that  is  expected  to  affect  these  resonances  is  a  close  proximity  of  large 

metallic  structures.  An  extremely  important  implication  of  this  fact  relates  to  safety 

considerations for human beings. Humans are also non-magnetic and can sustain strong magnetic 

fields  without  undergoing  any  risk  (a  typical  example  where  magnetic  fields  B~1T  are  safely 

used on humans is the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique for medical testing). 

In  comparison  of  the  two  classes  of  resonant  systems  under  examination,  the  strong 

immunity  to  extraneous  objects  and  the  absence  of  risks  for  humans  probably  makes  the 

conducting-wire loops the preferred choice for many real-world applications; on the other hand, 

systems of disks (or spheres) of high (effective) refractive index have the advantage that they are 

also  applicable  to  much  smaller  length-scales  (for  example  in  the  optical  regime  dielectrics 

prevail, since conductive materials are highly lossy). 

 

IV. Efficiency of energy-transfer scheme 

Consider again the combined system of a resonant source  s  and device  d  in the presence 

of  a  set  of  extraneous  objects  e ,  and  let  us  now  study  the  efficiency  of  this  resonance-based 

energy-transfer scheme, when energy is being drained from the device at rate  workΓ

 for use into 

operational work. The coupled-mode-theory equation for the device field-amplitude is

V. Conclusion 

In conclusion, we present a resonance-based scheme for mid-range wireless non-radiative 

energy  transfer.  Although  our  consideration  has  been  for  a  static  geometry  (namely κ  and  Γe 

were independent of time), all the results can be applied directly for the dynamic geometries of 

mobile objects, since the energy-transfer time 

μ−∼ 1 100 s  for microwave applications) is 

1κ−  (

much  shorter  than  any  timescale  associated  with  motions  of  macroscopic  objects.  Analyses  of 

very  simple  implementation  geometries  provide  encouraging  performance  characteristics  and 

further improvement is expected with serious design optimization. Thus the proposed mechanism 

is promising for many modern applications. For example, in the macroscopic world, this scheme 

could be used to deliver power to robots and/or computers in a factory room, or electric buses on 

a  highway  (source-cavity  would  in  this  case  be  a  “pipe”  running  above  the  highway).  In  the 

microscopic  world,  where  much  smaller  wavelengths  would  be  used  and  smaller  powers  are 

needed, one could use it to implement optical inter-connects for CMOS electronics, or to transfer 

energy to autonomous nano-objects (e.g. MEMS or nano-robots) without worrying much about 

the relative alignment between the sources and the devices. 

As  a  venue  of  future  scientific  research,  enhanced  performance  should  be  pursued  for 

electromagnetic  systems  either  by  exploring  different  materials,  such  as  plasmonic  or 

metallodielectric  structures  of  large  effective  refractive  index,  or  by  fine-tuning  the  system 

design,  for  example  by  exploiting  the  earlier  mentioned  interference  effects  between  the 

radiation fields of the coupled objects. Furthermore, the range of applicability could be extended 

to acoustic systems, where the source and device are connected via a common condensed-matter 

object.

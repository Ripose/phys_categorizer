We  present  the  statistics  of  the  significant  nouns  and  adjectives of social impact  figuring  in the 

nominations  of  the  Nobel  prizes  in  Physics  and  Chemistry  over  the  period  of  the  awards  from 

1901 to 2001.  

 

Interesting statistics on the ensemble of Nobel laureates  can be found in the literature. [1]   For the 

case  of  Physics,  Zhang  and  Fuller,  [2]  provided  a  recent  one  that  we  strongly  recommend  to  the 

reader.    One  can  find  therein  percentage  histograms  and  pie  charts  of  Nobel  winners  in  Physics 

according  to their nationality, countries of final degree, age groups, religion, subfields of Physics, 

and  so  on.  In the following, we review  how the original aim of Alfred Nobel that his prize should 

be awarded to “the  person  who  has  made  the  most  important discovery or  invention in the domain 

of X”, where X stands for Physics, Chemistry and  Medicine  has  been  respected  through  the  years. 

We thus perform a statistical study over the words employed in the awarding phrases for Physics 

(165 laureates) and Chemistry (137 laureates).   We set aside Medicine (175 laureates), because for 

this science the word discovery (discoveries) is missing in only  4 awards after 1918.  The results 

are presented in two tables and five histograms for 21 key nouns and 5 key adjectives of high social 

meaning  as  distributed  over  two  epochs,  before  and  after  1950.  Discovery  (discoveries)  is  indeed 

the  most  important  word  with  46(17)  and  17(5)  appearances  in  Physics  and  Chemistry, 

respectively. However,  invention  with  11  and  5  appearances,  respectively,  is  surpassed  by  other 

words  such  as  contribution,  development,  method, and  work,  the  latter  being  the  most  frequent 

word in Chemistry with 22 appearances, equal to the sum of discovery and discoveries.  

 
In the case of adjectives, the most frequent is fundamental, occurring essentially after 1950, with 10 

and 7 appearances in Physics and Chemistry, respectively.

ABSTRACT 
Ice formation in model biological membranes is studied by SAXS and WAXS in the presence of 
 
cryoprotectors:  dimethyl  sulfoxide  and  glycerol.  Three  types  of  phospholipid  membranes:  DPPC, 
DMPC, DSPC are chosen for the investigation as well-studied model biological membranes. A special 
cryostat  is  used  for  sample  cooling  from  14.1oC  to  −55.4oC.  The  ice  formation  is  only  detected  by 
WAXS  in  binary  phospholipid/water  and  ternary  phospholipid/cryoprotector/water  systems  in  the 
condition  of  excess  solvent.  Ice  formation  in  a  binary  phospholipid/water  system  creates  an  abrupt 
decrease of the membrane repeat distance by ∆d, so-called ice-induced dehydration of intermembrane 
space.  The  value  of  ∆d  decreases  as  the  cryoprotector  concentration  increases.  The  formation  of  ice 
does not influence the membrane structure (∆d = 0) for cryoprotector mole fractions higher than 0.05.

1. Introduction 
 
Dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  and  glycerol  are  well-known  cryoprotectors  widely  used  in 
cryobiology  for  the  conservation  of  biological  tissues  at  low  temperatures  [1].  The  main  purpose  of 
cryobiology is to find an "optimal" way for cooling biological systems to low temperatures (about the 
liquid nitrogen temperature), and prevent the crystallisation of water inside biological tissues. One of 
the  problems  is  a  longer  time  of  freeze-induced  dehydration  (diffusion  of  water  molecules  from 
biological tissues through the membrane to the conserving solvent) than the time of ice formation [2]. 
The  ice-induced  dehydration  of  intermembrane  space  at  the  moment  of  water  crystallization  is 
observed  by  X-ray  diffraction  [3]  and  calorimetry  [4]  for  binary  phospholipid /water  systems.  In 
macromolecular  crystallography 
the  portion  of  X-ray  diffraction  experiments  at  cryogenic 
temperatures is exponentially increasing. In many cases, a dramatic reduction in radiation damage at 
low temperatures allows complete data sets to be collected from a single crystal. cryoprotectors make 
it possible to cool samples to low temperature and store them without damage in the crystal [5].  
In this article ice formation is investigated by small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and 
 
WAXS)  in  ternary  phospholipid/cryoprotector/water  systems.  Three  phospholipids  are  studied: 
dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine 
and 
distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC). DPPC, DMPC, and DSPC are taken as phospholipids with an 
equal polar heads and with the difference in the length of hydrocarbon chains. The reason why we use 
DMSO  and  glycerol  is  the  fact  of  their  different  interactions  with  the  membrane  surface.  Glycerol 
penetrates  into  the  region  of  polar  head  groups  and  produces  influence  on  the  thickness  of  the 
membrane  bilayer  and  the  thickness  of  an  intermembrane  solvent  [6].  DMSO  molecules  do  not 
penetrate into the region of polar head groups and thus do not influence the membrane thickness [7,8]. 
DMSO molecules strongly interact with water molecules and form hydrogen bonds. Such interaction is 
more intensive than the interaction between DMSO and the polar head groups of DPPC [9]. Figure 1 
presents a model water topology in the intermembrane space of a `phospholipid/water system [4, 10].

2. EXPERIMENT 
DPPC,  DMPC,  DSPC  (over  99%  pure),  spectrophotometric  grade  DMSO  and  glycerol  are 
 
purchased from Sigma and Aldrich corporations (Paris, France). Water (18 MΩ·cm) are obtained by 
means  of  Millipore.  The  samples  are  prepared  in  quartz  capillaries.  The  capillaries  (1.5 mm  in 
diameter  and  0.01 mm  wall  thickness)  are  purchased  from  GLAS  company  (W.Muller,  Berlin, 
Germany).  
 
X-ray diffraction patterns are measured at LURE on the D22 beam line of DCI synchrotron ring. 
The time resolved diffraction is used to collect information about ice formation in the studied systems. 
Two  linear  position  sensitive  detectors  are  used.  The  first  detector  is  placed  at  sample  to  detector 
distance of 1690 mm in order to record the diffraction from a lipid multilamellar structure in the region 
of  the  scattering  vectors  −0.3Å−1  ≤ q ≤ 0.3  Å−1  (SAXS  measurements).  The  second  detector  (the 
sample  to  detector  distance  is  362 mm  ,  at  angle  of  70o  to  the  beam  direction)  is  used  to  record 
diffraction patterns from ice and a mutual parking of hydrocarbon chains in the region of the scattering 
vector  1.3Å−1  ≤ q ≤ 1.9  Å−1  (WAXS  measurements).  Such  geometry  gives  a  relatively  small 
uncertainty  in  the  determination  of  the  repeat  distance  (about  0.5 %).  The  diffraction  patterns  are 
measured at a rate of one minute per frame, the temperature of the sample is changed at a cooling  rate 
of 1.5 degree per minute. The period d (repeat distance) of multilamellar structures is determined from 
the position of the first diffraction peak using the Bragg equation: 2·d·sinθ = λ, where θ is a half of 
the scattering angle.  
 
The capillary holder used for X–rays consists of a cryostat developed in Paris–Sud University 
by G. Keller (CNRS, URA 1218). The sample is cooled by two Peltier elements and heat is evacuated

using liquid flow. A resistor is used to regulate the sample temperature and vary the temperature from 
+14°C to –55.4°C at a constant rate. Great care is taken to prevent water condensation on the surface 
of  the  capillary,  including  both  4  mylar  windows  and  dry  nitrogen  flow.  A  thermocouple  is  used  to 
measure the temperature with an accuracy of ± 0.1°C and a reproducibility of ± 0.5°C. 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figures 2a and 2b present a sequence of diffraction SAXS and WAXS patterns recorded in the 
 
process  of  sample  cooling  from  T = +14.1°C  to  T = −29.5°C.  Figure 2a  presents  the  time  resolved 
diffraction from a multilamellar structure of a DPPC membrane. At cooling from 14.1°C to −16.2°C 
the  diffraction  patterns  correspond  to  the  transformation  of  the  gel  phase  in  to  the  crystalline  phase 
[11]. The shift of the diffraction peak in the direction of a larger scattering vector q at Tice = −19.4°C 
corresponds to a decrease of the membrane repeat distance d. It is the result of ice formation in a bulk 
solvent.  Figure 2b  demonstrates  the  formation  of  three  diffraction  peaks  of  ice  at  Tice = −19.4°C 
which  correspond  to  the  lattice  constants:  3.9Å,  3.6Å,  3.4Å.  The  WAXS  from  a  mutual  parking  of 
hydrocarbon  chains  (see  Fig. 2b)  at  T = 14.1oC shows reflection  at  q = 1.49 ± 0.002Å-1 and a broad 
shoulder  at  q = 1.53  ± 0.01  Å-1.  These  reflections  correspond  to  an  orthorhombic  subcell  with  the 
lattice constants 8.46 ± 0.01Å and 9.38± 0.07Å [11]. The two reflections separate monotonously as the 
temperature  decreases  to  the  temperature  of  ice  formation  in  the  positions  1.46 ± 0.002Å-1  and 
1.58 ± 0.002Å-1  (lattice  constants  8.61 ± 0.01Å  and  8.97 ± 0.08Å).  Slow  progressive  conversion  of 
interchain space is the result of membrane crystallization. The membrane cystallization is a time and 
temperature  dependent  process  with  a  characteristic    time  of  12  hours  [11].  The  description  of  such 
process is beyond of the scope of this article. Membrane crystallization can be negligible in the study 
of a fast process, such  as water crystallization (character time is 3min). The main goal of our study is 
to describe changes in the membrane repeat distance ∆d at the moment of ice formation. The repeat 
distance  of  a  DPPC  multilayer,  d,  is  related  to  the  membrane  thickness  dl  and  the  thickness  of  the 
solvent  dw  in  the  intermembrane  space  via  the  expression  d = dl + dw.  A  decrease  in  d  at 
Tice = −19.4°C  may  occur  as  a  result  of  a  decrease  in  dl  or  dw.  At  the  moment  of  ice  formation 
(Tice = −19.4°C)  no  changes  in  interchain  space  were  detected.  The  membrane  thickness  dl  is  not 
affected by ice and a decrease in d occurs due to a decrease in dw, so-called ice-induced dehydration 
of intermembrane space.  

The dependence of d on the temperature for a complete cooling process is presented in Fig. 3 
for  a  binary  DPPC/water  system  (circles),  ternary  DPPC/DMSO/water  system  with  a  mole  DMSO 
fraction XDMSO = 0.05 (squares), and for the same ternary system without solvent excess, 20% w/w 
solvent concentration (triangles). An abrupt decrease of d by ∆d =  5.9 ± 0.6Å at Tice = −19.4°C for a 
binary DPPC/water system is the result of the ice-induced dehydration of intermembrane space at the 
moment  of  ice  formation  in  a  bulk  solvent.  The  slope  of  curves  correspond  to  the  first  stages  of 
membrane  crystallization.  The  membrane  crystallization  is  accompanied  with  the  dehydration  of 
intermembrane  space,  for  this  type  of  dehydration  the  characteristic  time  is  12  hours  which 
corresponds to slow water diffusion from intermembrane space to bulk solvent [11]. In the case of ice-
induced dehydration, water diffusion from intermembrane space to bulk solvent actually occurs in no 
time, the characteristic time is ≤ 3min. 

The  temperature  of  ice  formation  in  the  system  Tice  is  determined  from  WAXS  diffraction 
with an accuracy of ± 1.5oC. The quantity ∆d  is the difference in the membrane repeat distance at the 
temperature  before  ice  formation,  Tice  −  3oC,  and  the  temperature  after  ice  formation,  Tice  +  3oC. 
The values of ∆d and the ice formation temperature Tice decrease as XDMSO increases (see Table 1). 
∆d =   0.5 ± 0.6Å  at  Tice = − 23.2°C  for  a  system  with  XDMSO = 0.05  (see  Fig. 3).  Above 
XMSO = 0.05  changes  in  the  value  of  d  were  not  established.  For  a  dehydrated  DPPC/DMSO/water

system with XDMSO = 0.01 and XDMSO = 0.05, neither ice reflections nor an abrupt decrease in the 
value  of  d  were  detected.  In  Figure 3  the  curve  for  a  dehydrated  system  with  XDMSO = 0.05 
demonstrates  only  a  small  derivation  of  0.014Å/oC  connected  with  membrane  crystallization  at 
cooling.  

Similar  ice-induced  dehydration  was  measured  in  binary  DMPC/water  and  DSPC/water 
 = −17.50°C  and  leads  to  an  abrupt 
systems.  Ice  formation  occurs  in  a  DMPC/water  system  at  Tice
decrease  of  d  from  59.8. ± 0.3Å  before  ice  formation  (T= −14.5°C)  to  d = 53.5 ± 0.3Å  after  the  ice 
formation  (T= −21.5°C).  The  diffusion  of  free  water  from  intermembrane  space  to  bulk  water 
decreases the repeat distance by ∆d = 6.3 ± 0.6Å. For a binary DSPC/water system, the corresponding 
values are: d = 67.3 ± 0.4Å at T = −15.6°C before ice formation, d = 62.2 ± 0.3Å at T = −21.6°C after 
ice  formation.  Ice  formation  at  Tice = −18.6°C  creates  ice-induced  dehydration  of  intermembrane 
space  with  ∆d = 5.1 ± 0.7Å.  Changes  in  the  repeat  distance  ∆d  at  the  moment  of  ice  formation  have 
about  equal  values  for  three  types  of  lipid  molecules  (DMPC,  DPPC,  DSPC)  within  experimental 
errors.  
 
The results for the ice-induced dehydration of DPPC/DMSO/water, DPPC/glycerol/water, and 
DMPC/DMSO/water systems are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Each table presents the dependence 
of  the  ice  formation  temperature  Tice  and  ∆d  on  the  cryoprotector  mole  fraction.  The  value  of  ∆d 
becomes smaller as cryoprotector concentration increases. For the cryoprotector mole fractions above 
0.05, the value of d is not influenced by ice formation in bulk solvents. 

It is a typical property of biological objects (not only membranes) to expel some part of water 
to a bulk solvent during freezing as a result of the coexistence of free and bound water in biological 
systems [12]. The presence of a cryoprotector decreases ice-induced dehydration. DPPC/DMSO/water 
and DPPC/glycerol/water systems demonstrate the similar properties in the conditions of cooling and 
ice formation. It is important to note that the influences of DMSO and glycerol on the phospholipid 
membrane  structure  are  absolutely  different  [6,  7,  8,  9].  The  different  interaction  of  DMSO  and 
glycerol molecules with the membrane surface and a similar property of ternary DPPC/DMSO/water 
and  DPPC/glycerol/water  systems  at  cooling  give  us  a  possibility  to  suppose  that  the  properties  of 
ternary  phospholipid/cryoprotector/water  systems  mainly  depend  on  the  phase  diagram  of  the 
cryoprotector/water systems [13] and the quantities of free and bound water in intermembrane space 
[7, 14, 15].  
 
4. CONCLUSION 
 
The temperature of ice formation in a ternary phospholipid/cryoprotector/water system in the 
case of phospholipids: DMPC, DPPC, DSPC and cryoprotectors: DMSO, glycerol mainly depends on 
the phase diagram of the cryoprotector/water system. A decrease of the membrane repeat distance by 
∆d  depends  on  the  cryoprotector  mole  fraction.  For  the  cryoprotector  mole  fraction  0.04  −  0.05, 
expulsion of water from intermembrane space to bulk solvent is negligibly small at the moment of ice 
formation.  For  the  cryoprotector  mole  fraction  higher  than  0.05,  the  formation  of  ice  does  not 
influence the membrane structure.  

The  presence  of  ice  is  not  detected  in  ternary  phospholipid/cryoprotector/water  systems 
without solvent excess. In the temperature interval used (down to −55.4oC) the bound water has not 
freezed.

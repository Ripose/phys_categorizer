Summary 

Aerodynamic  force  generation  and  mechanical  power  requirements  of  a 
dragonfly (Aeschna juncea) in hovering flight are studied. The method of numerically 
solving the Navier-Stokes equations in moving overset grids is used. 

o52   and 

When the midstroke angles of attack in the downstroke and the upstroke are set 
o8 ,  respectively  (these  values  are  close  to  those  observed),  the  mean 
to 
vertical  force  equals  the  insect  weight  and  the  mean  thrust  is  approximately  zero. 
There are two large vertical force peaks in one flapping cycle. One is in the first half 
of the cycle, which is mainly due to the hindwings in their downstroke; the other is in 
the second half of the cycle, which is mainly due to the forewings in their downstroke. 
o52 ),  the  dragonfly  uses  drag  as  a  major 
Hovering  with  a  large  stroke  plane  angle  (
source for its weight supporting force (approximately 65% of the total vertical force is 
contributed by the drag and 35% by the lift of the wings). 

The vertical force coefficient of a wing is twice as large as the quasi-steady value. 
The interaction between the fore- and hindwings is not very strong and is detrimental 
to the vertical force generation. Compared with the case of a single wing in the same 
motion, the interaction effect reduces the  vertical  forces  on  the  fore-  and  hindwings 
by  14%  and  16%  of  that  of  the  corresponding  single  wing,  respectively.  The  large 
vertical  force  is  due  to  the  unsteady  flow  effects.  The  mechanism  of  the  unsteady 
force is that in each downstroke of the hindwing or the forewing, a new vortex ring

containing downward momentum is generated, giving an upward force. 

The body-mass-specific power is 37 W kg-1, which is mainly contributed by the 

aerodynamic power.

Introduction 

Dragonflies  are  capable  of  long-time  hovering,  fast  forward  flight  and  quick 
maneuver. Scientists have always been fascinated by their flight. Kinematic data such 
as  stroke  amplitude,  inclination  of  the  stroke-planes,  wing  beat  frequency  and 
phase-relation  between  the  fore-  and  hindwings,  etc.,  were  measured  by  taking 
high-speed  pictures  of  dragonflies  in  free-flight  (e.g.  Norberg,  1975;  Wakeling  and 
Ellington, 1997b) and tethered dragonflies (e.g. Alexander, 1984). Using these data in 
quasi-steady  analyses  (not  including  the  interaction  effects  between  forewing  and 
hindwing), it was shown that the lift coefficient required for flight was much greater 
than  the  steady-state  values  that  measured  from  dragonfly  wings  (Wakeling  and 
Ellington, 1997a). This suggested that unsteady wing motion or/and flow interaction 
between the fore- and hindwings must play important roles in the flight of dragonflies 
(Norberg, 1975; Wakeling and Ellington, 1997c). 

Force  measurement  on  a  tethered  dragonfly  was  conducted  by  Somps  and 
Luttges  (1985).  It  was  shown  that  over  some  part  of  a  stroke  cycle,  lift  force  was 
many  times  larger  than  that  measured  from  dragonfly  wings  under  steady-state 
conditions.  This  clearly  showed  that  the  effect  of  unsteady  flow  and/or  wing 
interaction  were  important.  Flow  visualization  studies  on  flapping  model  dragonfly 
wings  were  conducted  by  Saharon  and  Luttges  (1988,1989),  and  it  was  shown  that 
constructive  or  destructive  wing/flow  interactions  might  occur,  depending  on  the 
kinematic parameters of the flapping motion. In these studies, only the total force of 
the fore- and hindwings was measured, and moreover, force measurements and flow 
visualizations were conducted in separated works. 

In  order  to  further  understand  the  dragonfly  aerodynamics,  it  was  desirable  to 
have the aerodynamic force and flow structure simultaneously and also to know the 
force  on  the  individual  forewing  and  hindwing  during  their  flapping  motions. 
Freymuth (1990) conducted force measurement and flow visualization on an airfoil in 
hover  modes.  One  of  the  hover  modes  was  for  hovering  dragonflies.  Only  mean 
vertical force was measured. It was shown that large mean vertical force coefficient 
could be obtained and the force was related to a wake of vortex pairs which produced 
a  downward  jet  of  stream.  Wang  (2000) used  computational  fluid  dynamics  (CFD) 
method  to  study  the  aerodynamic  force  and  vortex  wake  structure  of  an  airfoil  in 
dragonfly hovering mode. Time variation of the aerodynamic force in each flapping 
cycle and the vortex shedding process were obtained. It was shown that large vertical 
force was produce during each downstroke and the mean vertical force was enough to 
support the weight of a typical dragonfly. During each downstroke, a vortex pair was 

2

created. The large vertical force was explained by the downward two-dimensional jet 
induced by the vortex pair. 

In  the  works  of  Freymuth  (1990) and  Wang  (2000),  only  a  single  airfoil  was 
considered.  Lan  and  Sun  (2001c)  studied  two  airfoils  in  dragonfly  hovering  mode 
using CFD method. For comparison, they also computed the flow of a single airfoil. 
For  the  case  of  single  airfoil,  their  results  of  aerodynamic  force  and  flow  structure 
were similar to that of Freymuth’s (1990) experiment and Wang’s (2000) computation. 
For the fore and aft airfoils flapping with 180º phase difference (counter stroking), the 
time variation of the aerodynamic force on each airfoil was broadly similar to that of 
the single airfoil; the major effect of interaction between the fore and aft airfoils was 
that the vertical forces on both the airfoils were decreased by approximately 20% in 
comparison with that of the single airfoil. 

The  above  works  (Freymuth,  1990;  Wang,  2000;  Lan  and  Sun,  2001c)  which 
obtained aerodynamic force and flow structure simultaneously were done for airfoils. 
It is well known that the lift on an airplane wing of large aspect ratio can be explained 
by a two dimensional wing theory. But for a dragonfly wing, although its aspect ratio 
is  relatively  large,  its  motion  is  much  more  complex  than  that  of  an  airplane  wing. 
Three dimensional effect should be investigated. Moreover, the effect of aerodynamic 
interaction between the fore- and hindwings in three-dimensional case are unknown. 
The work of Lan and Sun (2001c) on two airfoils flapping with 180º phase difference 
showed that interaction between the two airfoils was detrimental to their aerodynamic 
performance. This result is opposite to the common expectation that wing interaction 
of  a  dragonfly  would  enhance  its  aerodynamic  performance.  It  is  of  interest  to 
investigate how interaction effect will be in the three dimensional case. 

In  the  present  study,  we  extend  our  previous  two-dimensional  study  (Lan  and 
Sun, 2001c) to three dimensional case. As a first step, we study the case of hovering 
flight. For dragonfly Aeschna juncea in free hovering flight, detailed kinematic data 
were obtained by Norberg (1975). Morphological data of the dragonfly (wing shape, 
wing  size,  wing  mass  distribution,  weight  of  the  insect,  etc.)  are  also  available 
(Norberg, 1972). On the basis of these data, the flows and aerodynamic forces and the 
power required for producing the forces are computed and analyzed. Because of the 
unique feature of the motion, i.e. the forewing and the hindwing move relative to each 
other,  the  approach  of  solving  the  flow  equations  over  moving  overset  grids  is 
employed. 
 

Materials and methods 

The model wings and their kinematics 

The  fore-  and  hindwings  of  the  dragonfly  are  approximated  by  two  flat  plates. 
The  thickness  of  the  model  wings  is  1%c  (where  c  is  the  mean  chord  length  of  the 
forewing). The planforms of the model wings (see Fig. 1A) are similar to those of the 
real wings (Norberg, 1972). The two wings have the same length but the chord length 
of the hindwing is larger than that of the forewing. The radius of the second moment 
, where  r   is radial distance 
of the forewing area is denoted by

and 

fS   is the area of forewing); 

r
2 =

61.0

R

  ( R   is  the  wing  length).  The  flapping 

motions of the wings in hovering flight are sketched in Fig. 1B. The hindwing leads 

the forewing in phase by 

180   (Norberg, 1975). The azimuthal rotation of the wing 

o

about the z axis (see Fig. 1C) is called “translation” and the pitching (or flip) rotation 
of  the  wing  near  the  end  of  a  half-stroke  and  at  the  beginning  of  the  following 

half-stroke is called rotation. The speed at 

2r   is called the translational speed. 

The  flapping  motion  of  a  wing  is  simplified  as  follows.  The  wing  translates 
downward and upward along the stroke plane and rotates during stroke reversal (Fig. 

1B). The translational velocity is denoted by 

tu   and is given by

The angle of attack of the wing is denoted by  α . It assumes a constant value in 

the  middle  portion  of  a  half-stroke.  The  constant  value  is  denoted  by 

dα   for  the 

downstroke  and  by 

uα   for  the  upstroke.  Around  the  stroke  reversal,  α   changes 

with time and the angular velocity ( α& ) is given by:

The Navier-Stokes equations and solution method 

The Navier-Stokes equations are numerically solved using moving overset grids. 
For flow past a body in arbitrary motion, the  governing  equations  can  be  cast  in  an 
inertial frame of reference using a general time-dependent coordinate transformation 
to  account  for  the  motion  of  the  body.  The  non-dimensionalized  three-dimensional 
incompressible  unsteady  Navier-Stokes  equations,  written  in  the  inertial  coordinate 
system oxyz (Fig. 1C), are as follows:

where u, v and w are three components of the non-dimensional velocity and p is the 
non-dimensional  pressure.  In  the  non-dimensionalization,  U,  c  and  c/U are  taken  as 
the reference velocity, length and time, respectively. Re denotes the Reynolds number 

and is defined as 

Re

= cU

υ

, where  υ   is kinematic viscosity of the air. Equations 3 

to 6 are solved using an algorithm based on the method of artificial compressibility. 
The  algorithm  was  first  developed  by  Rogers  and  Kwak  (1990)  and  Rogers  et  al. 
(1991)  for  single-zone  grid,  and  it  was  extended  by  Rogers  and  Pulliam  (1994)  to 
overset grids. The algorithm is outlined below. 

The  equations  are  first  transformed  from  the  Cartesian  coordinate  system 

(

x,y,z

τ,

)  to  the  curvilinear  coordinate  system  (

,
,
τζηξ

,

)  using  a  general 

time-dependent coordinate transformation. For a flapping wing, in order to make the 

transformation  simple,  a  body-fixed  coordinate  system  (

o'x'y'z )  is  also  employed 

'

(Fig.1C).  In  terms  of  the  Euler  angles  α   and  φ   (defined  in  Fig.1C),  the  inertial 

coordinates  (o,x,y,z)  are  related  to  the  body-fixed  coordinates  (

o'x'y'z )  through  the

following relationship:

which  need  to  be  calculated  only  once.  As  a  wing  moves,  the  coordinate 

transformation  functions  vary  with  (

x,y,z

τ,

)  such  that  the  grid  system  moves  and 

always fits the wing. The body-fixed non-inertial frame of reference (

′′′′
zyxo

) is used 

in the initial grid generation. 

The  time  derivatives  of  the  momentum  equations  are  differenced  using  a 
second-order, three-point backward difference formula. To solve the time discretized 
momentum equations for a divergence free velocity at a new time level, a pseudo-time 
level is introduced into the equations and a pseudo-time derivative of pressure divided 
by  an  artificial  compressibility  constant  is  introduced  into  the  continuity  equation. 
The  resulting  system  of  equations  is  iterated  in  pseudo-time  until  the  pseudo-time 
derivative of pressure approaches zero, thus, the divergence of the velocity at the new 
time  level  approaches  zero.  The  derivatives  of  the  viscous  fluxes  in  the  momentum 
equation are approximated using second-order central differences. For the derivatives 
of  convective  fluxes,  upwind  differencing  based  on  the  flux-difference  splitting 
technique is used. A third-order upwind differencing is used at the interior points and 
a  second-order  upwind  differencing  is  used  at  points  next  to  boundaries.  Details  of 
this algorithm can be found in Rogers and Kwak (1990) and Rogers et al.(1991). For 
the  computation  in  the  present  work,  the  artificial  compressibility  constant  is  set  to 
100  (it  has  been  shown  that  when  the  artificial  compressibility  constant  varied 
between 10 and 300, the number of sub-iteration changes a little, but the final result 
does not change). 

With  overset  grids,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2,  for  each  wing  there  is  a  body-fitted 
curvilinear grid, which extends a relatively short distance from the body surface, and 
in  addition,  there  is  a  background  Cartesian  grid,  which  extends  to  the  far-field 
boundary  of  the  domain  (i.e.  there  are  three  grids).  The  solution  method  for 
single-grid is applied to each of the three grids. The wing grids capture features such 
as  boundary  layers,  separated  vortices  and  vortex/wing  interactions,  etc.  The 
background grid carries the solution to the far field. The two wing grids are overset 
onto the background Cartesian grid and parts of the two wing-grids overlap when the 
two wings move close to each other. As a result of the oversetting of the grids, there 
are hole regions in the wing grids and in the background grid. As the wing grids move, 
the holes and hole boundaries change with time. To determine the hole-fringe points, 

 

6

the method known as domain connectivity functions by Meakin (1993) is employed. 
Intergrid  boundary  points  are  the  outer-boundary  points  of  the  wing  grids  and  the 
hole-fringe  points.  Data  are  interpolated  from  one  grid  to  another  at  the  hole-fringe 
points  and  similarly,  at  the  outer-boundary  points  of  the  wing  grids.  In  the  present 
study,  the  background  grid  does  not  move  and  the  two  wing-grids  move  in  the 
background  grid.  The  wing  grids  are  generated  by  using  a  Poisson  solver  which  is 
based  on  the  work  of  Hilgenstock  (1988).  They  are  of  O-H  type  grids.  The 
background Cartesian grid is generated algebraically. Some portions of the grids are 
shown in Fig. 2. 

For  far  field  boundary  conditions,  at  the  inflow  boundary,  the  velocity 
components are specified as freestream conditions while pressure is extrapolated from 
the  interior;  at  the  outflow  boundary,  pressure  is  set  equal  to  the  free-stream  static 
pressure  and  the  velocity  is  extrapolated  from  the  interior.  On  the  wing  surfaces, 
impermeable  wall  and  no-slip  boundary  conditions  are  applied,  and  the  pressure  on 
the boundary is obtained through the normal component of the momentum equation 
written in the moving coordinate system. On the plane of symmetry of the dragonfly 
(the  XZ  plane;  see  Fig.1A),  flow-symmetry  conditions  are  applied  (i.e.  w   and  the 

derivatives of  u ,  v , and  p   with respect to  y   are set to zero). 

 

Evaluation of the aerodynamic forces 

The lift of a wing is the component of the aerodynamic force on the wing that is 
perpendicular to the translational velocity of the wing (i.e. perpendicular to the stroke 
plane); the drag of a wing is the component that is parallel to the translational velocity. 

fl

  and 

fd   denote  the  lift  and  drag  of  the  forewing,  respectively; 

hl

  and 

hd  

denote the lift and drag of the hindwing, respectively. Resolving the lift and drag into 

the  Z  and  X  directions  gives  the  vertical  force  and  thrust  of  a  wing. 

fL   and 

fT  

denote the vertical force and thrust of the forewing, respectively; 

hL   and 

hT   denote 

the vertical force and thrust of the hindwing, respectively. For the forewing,

Data of hovering flight in Aeshna juncea 

High-speed pictures of dragonfly Aeshna juncea in hovering flight was taken by 
Norberg  (1975)  and  the  following  kinematic  data  were  obtained.  For  both  the  fore- 

and hingwings, the chord is almost horizontal during the downstroke (i.e.

β≈α d

) and 

is  close  to  the  vertical  during  the  upstroke;  the  stroke  plane  angle  ( β )  is 

approximately 

o60 ; the stroke frequency ( n ) is 36 Hz, the stroke amplitude ( Φ ) is 

o69 ; the hindwing leads the forewing in phase by 

180 . The mass of the insect ( m ) 

o

is 754 mg; forewing length is 4.74 cm; hindwing length is 4.60 cm; the mean chord 
lengths of the fore- and hindwings are 0.81 cm and 1.12 cm, respectively; the moment 
of inertial of wing-mass with respect to the fulcrum ( I ) is 4.54 g cm2 for the forewing 
and 3.77 g cm2 for the hindwing (Norberg, 1972). 

On the basis of the above data, the parameters of the model wings and the wing 
kinematics are determined as following. The lengths of both wings ( R ) are assumed 
as 4.7 cm; the reference length (the mean chord length of the forewing) 
  cm;

Results and analysis 
Test of the solver 

A  single-grid  solver  based  on  the  computational  method  described  above  was 
developed  by  Lan  and  Sun  (2001a).  It  was  tested  by  the  analytical  solutions  of  the 
boundary  layer  flow  on  a  flat  plate  (Lan  and  Sun,  2001a)  and  by  the  measured 
unsteady  forces  on  a  flapping  model  fruit  fly  wing  (Sun  and  Wu,  2003).  A  moving

overset-grid  solver  for  two  dimensional  flow  based  on  the  above  method  was 
developed  by  the  same  authors  and  it  was  tested  by  comparison  with  the  analytical 
solution of the starting flow around an elliptical airfoil (Lan and Sun, 2001b,c). The 
two-dimensional  moving  overset-grids  solver  is  extended  to  three-dimension  in  the 
present  study.  The  three-dimensional  moving  overset-grids  solver  is  tested  here  in 
three  ways.  First  the  flow  past  a  starting  sphere  is  considered,  for  which  the 
approximate solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is known. Secondly, the code is 
tested  by  comparing  with  the  results  of  the  single-grid.  Finally,  the  code  is  tested 
against experimental data of a flapping model fruit fly wing by Sane and Dickinson 
(2001). 

As a first test, it is noted that in the initial stage of the starting motion of a sphere, 
because  the  boundary  layer  is  still  very  thin,  the  flow  around  the  sphere  can  be 
adequately treated by potential flow theory, and the flow velocity around the sphere 
and  the  drag  (added-mass  force)  on  the  sphere  can  be  obtained  analytically.  The 
acceleration of the sphere during the initial start is a cosine function of time; after the 

initial start, the sphere moves at constant speed (

sU ). In the numerical calculation, the 

Reynolds number [based on 

sU   and the radius ( a ) of the sphere] is set as 103. Fig. 

3A  shows  the  numerical  and  analytical  drag  coefficients  (

the  numerical  result  is  in  very  good  agreement  with  the  analytical  solution.  Fig.  3B

  as  a  function  of 

ar 2   ( r   is  radial 

distance) with fixed azimuthal angle

analytical solution outside the boundary layer. 

In  the  second  test,  the  flow  around  the  starting  sphere  is  computed  by  the 
single-grid  code,  and  the  results  computed  using  the  single-grid  and  moving 
overset-grid are compared (also in Fig. 3). They are in good agreement. For the case 

of single-grid, the grid is of O-O type, where the numerical coordinates (

along the standard spherical coordinates. It has dimensions 
. The outer 
boundary is set at

sizes  of 
  were  also  used.  By  comparing  the  results

from  these  three  grids,  it  was  shown  that  the  grid  size  of 
  was 
appropriate for the computation. For the case of moving overset-grids, the grid system 
consists two grids, one is the curvilinear grid of the sphere; another is the background 
Cartesian  grid.  The  outer  boundary  of  the  sphere  grid  is  at 
  from  the  sphere 
surface  and  the  out  boundary  of  the  background  grid  is 
a30   from  the  sphere.  The 
grid density is made similar to that of the single-grid.

aerodynamic forces are computed for the flapping model fruit fly wing. The computed 
lift and drag are compared with the measured in Fig.4. In the computation, the wing 
grid has dimensions 
  around the wing section, in normal direction and 
in  spanwise  direction,  respectively;  the  outer  boundary  of  the  wing  grid  is 
approximately  2.0 c   from  the  wing.  The  background  Cartesian  grid  has  dimensions 
  and  the  outer  boundary  is  20 c   from  the  wing.  The  non-dimensional 
90
time step is 0.02. Grid density test was conducted and it was shown that above overset 
grids  were  appropriate  for  the  computation.  In  Figs  4A,B,  the  flapping  amplitude  is

the computed lift and drag forces are in reasonably good agreement with the measured

The total vertical force and thrust; comparison with insect weight 

In  the  calculation,  the  wings  start  the  flapping  motion  in  still  air  and  the 
calculation  is  ended  when  periodicity  in  aerodynamic  forces  and  flow  structure  is 
approximately  reached  (periodicity  is  approximately  reached  2-3  periods  after  the 
calculation is started).

Figure  5  shows  the  total  vertical  force  and  thrust  coefficients  in  one  cycle, 
computed by two grid systems, grid-system 1 and grid-system 2. In both grid-systems, 
the outer boundary of the wing-grid was set at about 
c2   from the wing surface and 
that  of  the  background-grid  at  about 
c40   from  the  wings.  For  grid-system  1,  the 
wing grid had dimensions 
  in the normal direction, around the wing and 
45
in  the  spanwise  direction,  respectively,  and  the  background  grid  had  dimensions 
  in the X (horizontal), Z (vertical) and Y directions, respectively (Figure 
90
3  shows  a  portion  of  grid-system  1).  For  grid-system  2,  the  corresponding  grid 
dimensions were 
. For both grid systems, grid points 
×
of  the  background  grid  concentrated  in  the  near  field  of  the  wings  where  its  grid 
density was approximately the same as that of the outer part of the wing-grid. As seen 
in Fig. 5, there is almost no difference between the force coefficients calculated by the 
two  grid-systems.  Calculations  were  also  conducted  using  a  larger  computational 
domain.  The  domain  was  enlarged  by  adding  more  grid  points  to  the  outside  of  the 
background  grid  of  grid-system  2.  The  calculated  results  showed  that  there  was  no 
need  to  put  the  outer  boundary  further  than  that  of  grid-system  2.  It  was  concluded 
that grid-system 1 was appropriate for the present study. The effect of time step value 
was considered and it was found that a numerical solution effectively independent of 
the  time  step  was  achieved  if

present calculations.

From Fig. 5, it is seen that there are two large 

LC   peaks in one cycle, one in the 

first half of the cycle (while the hindwing is in its downstroke) and the other is in the 
second half of the cycle (while the forewing is in its downstroke). It should be noted 

 

10

that by having two large 

LC   peaks alternatively in the first and second halves of a 

cycle, the flight would be smoother. Averaging 

LC   (and 

TC ) over one cycle gives 

the  mean  vertical  force  coefficient  (

LC )  [and  the  mean  thrust  coefficient  (

TC )]; 

L =C

35.1

  and 

T =C

02.0

. The 

LC   value of 1.35 gives a vertical force of 756 mg, 

approximately equal to the insect weight (754 mg). The computed mean thrust (11 mg) 
is close to zero. That is, the force balance condition is approximately satisfied. In the 
calculation, the stroke plane angle, the midstroke angles of attack for the downstroke 

and  the  upstroke  have  been  set  as 

o52=β

, 

d =α

o52

  and 

u =α

o8

,  respectively. 

These values of  β , 

dα   and 

uα   give an approximately balanced flight and they are 

close  to  the  observed  values  [

o60≈β

,  during  the  downstroke  the  chord  is  almost 

horizontal (i.e. 

β≈α d

), and during the upstroke the chord is close to vertical]. 

 

The forces of the forewing and the hindwing 

The  total  vertical  force  (or  thrust)  coefficient  is  the  sum  of  vertical  force  (or 
thrust)  coefficient  of  the  fore-  and  hindwings.  Figure  6  gives  the  vertical  force  and 

thrust  coefficients  of  the  fore-  and  hindwings.  The  hindwing  produces  a  large 

hL,C  

peak  during  its  downstroke  (the  first  half  of  the  cycle)  and  very  small 

hL,C   in  its 

upstroke  (the  second  half  of  the  cycle);  this  is  true  for  the  forewing,  but  its 
downstroke is in the second half of the cycle. Comparing Fig. 6 with Fig. 5 shows that 

the hindwing in its downstroke is responsible for the large 

LC   peak in the first half 

of the cycle and the forewing in its downstroke is responsible for the large 

LC   peak 

in the second half of the cycle. The contributions to the mean total vertical force by 
the forewing and hindwing are 42% and 58%, respectively. The vertical force on the 
hindwing is 1.38 times of that on the forewing. Note that the area of the hindwing is 
1.32  times  of  that  of  the  forewing.  That  is,  the  relatively  large  vertical  force  on  the 
hindwing is mainly due to its relatively large size. 

The vertical force and thrust coefficients of a wing are the results of the lift and 

drag coefficients of the wing. The corresponding lift and drag coefficients 

fl,C , 

fd,C , 

hl,C ,  and 

hd,C   are  shown  in  Fig.  7.  For  the  hindwing, 

hd,C   is  larger  than 

hl,C  

during the downstroke of the wing; and  β   is large (

o52 ). As a result, a large part of 

 

11

hL,C   is  from 

hd,C   (approximately  65%  of 

hL,C   is  from 

hd,C   and  35%  is  from 

hl,C ). This is also true for the forewing. That is, the dragonfly uses drag as a major 

source for its weight supporting force when hovering with a large stroke plane angle. 

 

The mechanism of the large vertical force 

As shown in Fig. 6, the peak value of 

hL,C   is approximately 3.0 (that of 

fL,C   is 

approximately 2.6). Note that in the definition of the force coefficient, that total area 

of the fore- and hindwings (

S +
f

S

h

) and the mean flapping velocity  U   are used as 

reference area and reference velocity, respectively. For the hindwing, if its own area 
and  the  instantaneous  velocity  are  used  as  reference  area  and  reference  velocity, 
force  coefficient  would  be 
respectively,

.  Since  the  thrust  coefficients 

fT,C   and 

hT,C   are  small, 

fL,C   and 

hL,C   can  be  taken  as  the  coefficients  of  the 

4.21.2 −

resultant  aerodynamic  force  on  the  fore-  and  hindwings,  respectively.  The  above 
shows that the peak value of resultant aerodynamic force coefficient for the forewing 
or  hindwing  is 
  (when  using  the  area  of  the  corresponding  wing  and  the 
instantaneous  velocity  as  reference  area  and  reference  velocity,  respectively).  This 
value  is  approximately  twice  as  large  as  the  steady-state  value  measured  on  a 
dragonfly  wing  at 
  (steady-state  aerodynamic  forces  on  the  fore- 
and hindwings of dragonfly Sympetrum sanguineum were measured in wind-tunnel by 
Wakeling and Ellington, 1997a; the maximum resultant force coefficient, obtained at 

730 −

1890

=Re

angle of attack of around 

o60 , was approximately 1.3). 

There  are  two  possible  reasons  for  the  large  vertical  force  coefficients  of  the 
flapping wings: one is the unsteady flow effect; the other is the effect of interaction 
between the fore- and hindwings (in steady-state wind-tunnel test, interaction between 
fore- and hindwings was not considered). 
The effect of interaction between the fore- and hindwings 

In  order  to  investigate  the  interference effect  between  the  fore-  and  hindwings, 
we  computed  the  flow  around  a  single  forewing  (and  also  a  single  hindwing) 
performing  the  same  flapping  motion  as  above.  Figure  8A,B  gives  vertical  force 

(

sfL,C ) and thrust (

sfT,C ) coefficients of the single forewing, compared with 

fL,C   and 

fT,C , respectively. The differences between 

sfL,C   and 

fL,C   and between 

sfT,C   and 

fT,C   show the interaction effect. Similar comparison for the hindwing is given in Fig. 

 

12

8C,D. For both the fore- and hindwings, the vertical force coefficient on single wing 
(i.e. without interaction) is a little larger than that with interaction. For the forewing, 
the interaction effect reduces the mean vertical force coefficient by 14% of that of the 
single  wing;  for  the  hindwing,  the  reduction  is  16%  of  that  of  the  single  wing.  The 
interaction effect is not very large and is detrimental to the vertical force generation.   
The unsteady flow effect 

The  above  results  show  that  the  interaction  effect  between  the  fore-  and 
hindwings  is  small  and,  moreover,  is  detrimental  to  the  vertical  force  generation. 
Therefore, the large vertical force coefficients produced by the wings must be due to 
the  unsteady  flow  effect.  Here  the  flow  information  is  used  to  explain  the  unsteady 
aerodynamic force. 

First,  the  case  of  single  wing  is  considered.  Figure  9  gives  the  iso-vorticity 
surface plots at various times during one cycle.  In  order  to  correlate  force  and  flow 
information, we express time during a stroke cycle as a non-dimensional parameter, 

tˆ , such that 

ˆ =t

0

  at the start of the cycle and 

1ˆ =t

  at the end of the cycle. After 

the downstroke of the hindwing has just started (

125.0

; Fig. 9A), a starting vortex 

ˆ =t

is  generated  near  the  trailing  edge  of  the  wing  and  a  leading  edge  vortex  (LEV)  is 
generated  at  the  leading  edge  of  the  wing;  the  LEV  and  the  starting  vortex  are 
connected  by  the  tip  vortices,  forming  a  vortex  ring.  Through  the  downstroke  (Fig. 
9B,C),  the  vortex  ring  grows  in  size  and  moves  downward.  At  stroke  reversal 

(between 

ˆ ≈t

36.0

  and 

ˆ ≈t

65.0

), the wing rotates and the LEV is shed. During the 

upstroke, the wing almost does not produce any vorticity. The vortex ring produced 
during the downstroke is left below the stroke plane (Fig. 9D,E,F) and will convect 
downwards due to its self-induced velocity. The vortex ring contains a downward jet 
(see  below).  We  thus  see  that  in  each  cycle,  a  new  vortex  ring  carrying  downward 
momentum is produced, resulting in an upward force. This qualitatively explains the 
unsteady vertical force production. Figure 10 gives the velocity vectors projected in a 
vertical  plane  that  is  parallel  to  and  0.6R  from  the  plane  of  symmetry  of  the  insect. 
The downward jet is clearly seen. 

Figure 11 gives the iso-vorticity surface plots for the fore- and hindwings (in the 
first half of the cycle the hindwing is in its downstroke; in the second half of the cycle 
the forewing in its downstroke). Similar to the case of single wing, just after the start 
of the first half of the cycle, a new vortex ring is produced by the hindwing (Fig. 11A); 
this vortex ring grows in size and convects downwards (Fig. 11A,B,C). Similarly, just 
after  the  start  of  the  second  half  of  the  cycle,  a  new  vortex  ring  is  produced  by  the 
forewing  (Fig.  11D),  which  also  grows  in  size  and  convects  downwards  as  time 
increasing.  Figure12  gives  the  corresponding  velocity  vector  plots.  The  qualitative 
explanation of the large unsteady forces on the fore- and hindwings is similar to that 
for the single wing. 

On the basis of the above analysis of the aerodynamic force mechanism, we give 
a preliminary explanation for why the forewing-hindwing interaction is not strong and 

 

13

is  detrimental.  The  new  vortex  ring,  which  is  responsible  for  the  large  aerodynamic 
force  on  a  wing,  is  generated  by  the  rapid  unsteady  motion  of  the  wing  at  a  large 
angle of attack. As a result, the effect of the wake of the other wing is relatively small. 
Moreover, the wake of the other wing produces downwash velocity, resulting in the 
detrimental effects. 

 

Power requirements 
As shown above, the computed lift is enough to support the insect weight and the 
horizontal  force  is  approximately  zero;  i.e.  the  force  balance  conditions  of  hovering 
are  satisfied.  Here  we  calculate  the  mechanical  power  output  of  the  dragonfly.  The 
mechanical  power  includes  the  aerodynamic  power  (work  done  against  the 
aerodynamic  torques)  and  the  inertial  power  (work  done  against  the  torques  due  to 
accelerating the wing-mass). 

As  expressed  in  equation  20  of  Sun  and  Tang  (2002),  the  aerodynamic  power 
consists of two parts, one due to the aerodynamic torque for translation and the other 
to the aerodynamic torque for rotation. The coefficients of these two torques (denoted 

by 

ta,Q,C

  and 

ra,Q,C

, respectively) are defined as

rotation  ( z′   axis)  and  the  axis  of  pitching  rotation,  respectively.

  and 

ra,Q,C

 

are shown in Fig.13A,B. It is seen that 

ta,Q,C

  is much larger than 

ra,Q,C

.   

The inertial power also consists of two parts (see equation 35 of Sun and Tang, 
2002), one due to the inertial torque for translation and the other to the inertial torque 

for rotation. The coefficient of inertial torque for translation (

ti,Q,C ) is defined as

moment  of  inertial  of  wing-mass  with  respect  to  the  axis  of  flip  rotation  is  not 
available. Because most of the wing-mass is located near the axis of flip rotation, it is 
expected that the inertial torque for rotation is much smaller than that for translation. 
That is, both the aerodynamic and inertial torques for rotation might be much smaller 

 

14

than those for translation. In the present study, the aerodynamic and inertial torques 
for rotation are neglected in the power calculation.

ap,C   and 

ip,C , 

respectively) are also shown. For the forewing (Fig.14A), the time course of 

pC   is 

similar to that of 

ap,C   in the downstroke and to that of 

ip,C   in the upstroke; i.e. the 

aerodynamic power dominates over the downtroke and the inertial power dominates 
over the upstroke. This is also true for the hindwing (Fig. 14B). 

Integrating 

pC   over the part of a wingbeat cycle where it is positive gives the 

coefficient of positive work (

WC ) for translation. Integrating 

pC   over the part of the 

+

cycle where it is negative gives the coefficient of ‘negative’ work (

−

WC ) for ‘braking’ 

the wing in this part of the cycle. 

+

WC   and 

−

WC   for the forewing are 8.33 and -2.16, 

respectively. For the hindwing, they are 8.93 and -1.14, respectively. 

The mass specific power (

∗P ) is defined as the mean mechanical power over a 

flapping cycle divided by the mass of the insect, and it can be written as follows (Sun 
and Tang, 2002):

where 

fW,C   and 

hW,C   are  the  coefficients  of  work  per  cycle  for  the  fore-  and 

hindwings,  respectively.  When  calculating 

fW,C   or 

hW,C ,  one  needs    to  consider 

how  the  negative  work  fits  into  the  power  budget.  There  are  three  possibilities 
(Weis-Fogh,  1972;  Ellington,  1984).  One  is  that  the  negative  power  is  simply 

 

15

dissipated as heat and sound by some form of an end stop, then it can be ignored in 
the power budget. The second is that in the period of negative work, the excess energy 
can  be  stored  by  an  elastic  element,  and  this  energy  can  then  be  released  when  the 
wing  does  positive  work.  The  third  is  that  the  flight  muscles  do  negative  work  (i.e. 
they  are  stretched  while  developing  tension,  instead  of  contracting  as  in  “positive” 
work)  but  the  negative  work  uses  much  less  metabolic  energy  than  an  equivalent 
amount of positive work, and again, the negative power can be ignored in the power 

budget.  That  is,  out  of  these  three  possibilities,  two  ways  of  computing 

fW,C   or 

hW,C   can be taken. One is neglecting the negative work, i.e.:

Discussion 
Comparison with previous two-dimensional results 

Wang  (2000)  and  Lan  and  Sun  (2001c)  have  presented  two-dimensional  (2D) 
computations  based  on  wing  kinematics  similar  to  those  used  in  this  study.  Wang 
(2000) investigated the case of a single airfoil; Lan and Sun (2001c) investigated both 
the  cases  of  a  single  airfoil  and  fore  and  aft  airfoils.  It  is  of  interest  to  make 
comparison between the present three-dimensional (3D) and the previous 2D results. 

The 

LC   value  (single  airfoil)  computed  by  Wang  (2000)  is  approximately  is 

1.97 [in figure 4 of Wang (2000), maximum of 

tu   is used as reference velocity and 

the 

LC   value is approximately 0.8; if the mean of 

tu   is used as reference velocity, 

the 

LC   value  becomes 

)5.0(8.0

×

2 =π

97.1

];  approximately  the  same 

LC   value 

(single  airfoil)  was  obtained  by  Lan  and  Sun  (2001c).  In  the  present  study,  the 

LC  

values  for  the  single  forewing  and  single  hindwing  are  1.51  and  1.64,  respectively, 

 

 

16

approximately 20% less than the 2D value. This shows that the 3D effect on 

LC   is 

significant. The wing length-to-chord ratio is not small (approximately 5); one might 
expect  a  small  3D  effect.  But  for  a  flapping  wing  (especially  in  hover  mode),  the 
relative  velocity  varies  along  the  wing  span,  from  zero  at  the  wing  base  to  its 

maximum at the wing tip, which can increase the 3D effect. Note that although 

LC  

is reduced by 3D effect significantly, the time course of 

LC   of the forewing or the 

hindwing  is  nearly  identical  to  that  of  the  airfoil  (compare  Fig.  6A  with  figure  3  of 
Wang, 2000). 

Lan  and  Sun’s  (2001c)  results  for  the  fore  and  aft  airfoils  showed  that  the 
interaction effect decreased the vertical forces on the airfoils by approximately 22% 
compared to that of the single airfoil. For the fore- and the hindwings in present study, 
the reduction is approximately 15%, showing that 3D forewing-hindwing interaction 
is weaker than the 2D case. 

 

 

Aerodynamic force mechanism and forewing-hindwing interaction 

Recent  studies  (e.g.  Ellington  et  al,  1996;  Dickinson  et  al,  1997;  Wu  and  Sun, 
2004)  have  shown  that  the  large  unsteady  aerodynamic  forces  on  flapping  model 
insect  wings  are  mainly  due  to  the  attachment  of  a  LEV  or  the  delayed  stall 
mechanism. This also true for the fore- and hindwings in the present study. The LEV 
dose not shed before the end of the downstroke of the fore- or hindwing (Fig. 11). If 
the LEV sheds shortly after the start of the downstroke, the LEV would be very close 
to the starting vortex and a vortex ring that carries a large downward momentum (i.e. 
the  large  aerodynamic  forces)  could  not  be  produced.  Generation  of  a  vortex  ring 
carrying large downward momentum is equivalent to the delayed stall mechanism. 

Data presented in Fig. 8 show that the forewing-hindwing interaction is not very 
strong and is detrimental. In obtaining these data, the wing kinematics observed for a 

dragonfly  in  hovering  flight  (e.g. 

180   phase  difference  between  the  forewing  and 

o

the  hindwing;  no  incoming  free-stream)  has  been  used.  Although  some  preliminary 
explanation  have  been  given  for  this  result,  at  the  present,  we  cannot  distinguish 
whether or not this result will exist when the phasing, the incoming flow condition, 
etc., are varied. Analysis based on flow simulations in which the wing kinematics and 
the flight velocity are systematically varied is needed. 

Power requirements compared with quasi-steady results and with Drosophila results 
Wakeling  and  Ellington  (1997b,c)  computed  the  power  requirements  for  the 
dragonfly Sympetrum sanguineum. In most cases they investigated, the dragonfly was 
in accelerating and/or climbing flight. Only one case is close to hovering (flight SSan 
5.2); in this case, the flight speed is rather low (advance ration is approximately 0.1) 
and  the  resultant  aerodynamic  force  is  close  to  the  insect  weight  (see  figure  7D  of 
Wakeling and Ellington, 1997b and figure 5 of Wakeling and Ellington, 1997c). Their 

 

17

computed  body-mass  specific  aerodynamic  power  is  17.1  W  kg-1  (see  table  3  of 
Wakeling  and  Ellington,  1997c;  note  that  we  have  converted  the  muscle  specific 
power  given  in  the  table  to  the  body-mass  specific  power),  only  approximately  half 
the value calculated in the present study. Lehman and Dickinson (1997) and Sun and 
Tang  (2002),  based  on  experimental  and  CFD  studies,  respectively,  showed  that  for 
fruit flies, calculation by quasi-steady analysis might under-estimate the aerodynamic 
power by 50%. Similar result is seen for the hovering dragonflies. 

It  is  of  interest  to  note  that  the  value  of 

∗P   for  the  dragonfly  in  the  present 

study (37 W kg-1) is not very different from that computed for a fruit fly (30 W kg-1; 
Sun and Tang, 2002), even their sizes are greatly different (the wing length of the fruit 
fly  is  0.3  cm  and  that  of  the  dragonfly  is  4.7  cm).  For  the  fruit  fly,  the  mechanical 
power  is  mainly  contributed  by  aerodynamic  power  (Sun  and  Tang,  2002).  It  is 
approximately  the  case  with  the  dragonfly  in  the  present  study  (see  Fig.14).  From 
equation 15 of Sun and Tang (2002), the aerodynamic torque of a wing can be written 
as

where  d   is the mean drag of the wing; 

dˆr   is the radius of the first moment of the 

drag normalized by R. When the majority of the power is due to aerodynamic torque, 

∗P   can be approximated as

Ld

  is the ratio of the mean drag to the mean vertical force of the wing. For the fruit 

fly, this ratio is around 1 (Sun and Tang, 2002). For the dragonfly in this study, since a 
large part of the vertical force is contributed by the drag, this ratio is not very different 

from 1. We assume 

dˆr   for the two insects is not very different. Then, 

∗P   depends 

mainly  on 

RnΦ   (half  the  mean  tip  speed).  The  dragonfly’s  R  is  approximately  16 

times of that of the fruit fly; but its  Φn   (

36

Hz

×

) is approximately 1/14 of that 

of  the  fruit  fly  (

).  This  explains  why 

∗P   of  the  dragonfly  is  not  very 

different from that of the fruit fly.

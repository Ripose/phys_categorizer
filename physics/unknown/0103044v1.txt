Abstract

Current  approaches  to  the  problem  of  inertia  attempt  to  explain  the  inertial  properties  of  matter  by
expressing  the  inertial  mass  appearing  in  Newton's  second  law  of  motion  in  terms  of  some  other  more
fundamental interaction.  One increasingly popular approach explains inertial and gravitational forces as drag
forces  arising  due  to  quantum  vacuum  zero-point  phenomena.    General  relativity,  however,  suggests  that
gravitational  and  inertial  forces  are  manifestations  of  space-time  geometry.    Based  on  this,  the  present
analysis demonstrates that inertia and zero-point forces are ultimately relativistic in origin.  Additionally, it is
argued  that  body  forces  induced  on  matter  through  zero-point  interactions  are  resistive  forces  acting  in
addition to inertia.

1. Introduction

One of the longest standing questions in physics certainly has been by what means do material bodies

resist changes to their states of motion (inertia).  One approach to this problem has been to view inertia as

merely a fundamental property of all matter with no further explanation attainable.  Another approach has

been  to  view  inertia  as  arising  due  to  a  gravitational  coupling  among  all  matter  in  the  universe.    This

approach, first proposed by Mach (ca. 1883), stems from the notion that relative motion is meaningless in

the absence of surrounding matter.  With this in mind, one is then led to the idea that the inertial properties

of  matter  must  somehow  be  related  to  the  cosmic  distribution  of  all  matter  in  the  universe  [1].

Unfortunately,  Mach's  principle  leads  to  action  at  a  distance  phenomena  which  even  today  appear

irreconcilable with accepted theory.

Newton's second law of motion,

More  recent  studies  have  sought  to  explain  inertia  by  expressing  the  inertial  mass  m  appearing  in

in  terms  of  some  other  more  fundamental  entity  or  interaction.    At  present,  there  appears  to  be  several

approaches to this end.  One approach put forth by J. F. Woodward and T. Mahood seeks to preserve, and

apparently expand upon, the Machian view mentioned above [1]-[2].  Another approach, put forth  within

the Standard Model of particle physics, proposes a scalar Higgs field which assigns specific quantities of

energy to elementary particles.  With this approach, elementary particles possess inertial properties simply

because they possess energy, which is equivalent to mass.  Unfortunately, the Higgs mechanism stops short

of  actually  explaining  why  mass,  or  energy,  resists  acceleration.    Consequently,  the  Higgs  mechanism

leaves us with the above-mentioned notion, mentioned above, that inertia is a fundamental property of all

matter with no further explanation attainable.  Still another approach to the problem of inertia has been put

forth  by  B.  Haisch,  A.  Rueda,  H.  E.  Puthoff,  et  al  [3]-[4].    With  their  approach,  it  is  proposed  that  the

inertial properties of ordinary matter are due to local interactions between a vacuum electromagnetic zero-

point field  (ZPF)  and  subatomic  particles,  such  as  quarks  and  electrons,  constituting  ordinary  matter.    In

1

essence, the ZPF approach asserts that when a material object accelerates through the zero-point radiation

pervading all of space, some of the radiation is scattered by the quarks and electrons constituting the object.

This  scattering  of  radiation  exerts  a  reactive  body  force  on  the  object,  which,  according  to  the  ZPF

proposal, can be associated with the inertial mass of the object.

Although  we  challenged  the  ZPF  proposal  in  previous  papers  [5]-[6],  the  ZPF  proposal  seems

increasingly appealing.  Not only does the ZPF proposal suggest a local basis for gravitational and inertial

forces, thus avoiding action at a distance phenomena often associated with Mach's principle, but also seems

to  suggest  an  intimate  relationship  between  electromagnetism,  inertia,  and  gravitation  [3]-[4].    However,

while current ZPF theory does show that zero-point phenomena give rise to body forces on ordinary matter,

this is only part of the story.

According to the ZPF proposal, the intrinsic rest mass-energy content of matter is induced in large part

through  interaction  with  zero-point  radiation.    Incident  zero-point  radiation  imparts  an  ultrarelativistic

jittering  motion,  or  zitterbewegung  [4],  to  the  quarks  and  electrons  comprising  ordinary  matter,  thereby

endowing matter with large quantities of internal kinetic energy.  With this paradigm, the rest mass-energy

of  matter  predicted  by  the  familiar  expression 

  is  interpreted  as  entirely  ZPF-induced  kinetic

E mc=

2

energy.  But this seems to suggest that subatomic particles  have  no intrinsic rest  mass-energy  aside from

their  ZPF-induced  motion.    Of  course  subatomic  particles  are,  indeed,  well  known  to  possess  definite

quantities  of  intrinsic  rest  mass-energy.    A  more  traditional  interpretation  is  that 

E mc=

2

  is  simply  a

statement that all forms of energy exhibit inertial properties [7]-[8], which can be associated with inertial

mass,  and  that  mass  is  merely  one  particular  embodiment  of  energy.    Herein,  both  interpretations  are

utilized; the energy content of matter comprises intrinsic rest mass-energy as well as internal kinetic energy

due to ZPF-induced zitterbewegung [4] of subatomic particles.

Another  important  point  to  recognize  is  that  general  relativity  suggests  that  gravitational  and  inertial

forces alike arise due to the behavior of space-time [9]-[14].  This implies that greater insight into the origin

of  inertia  cannot  be  obtained  simply  by  eliminating  the  inertial  mass  m  appearing  in  Eq.  (1)  in  favor  of

some  other  entity  or  interaction.    Rather,  space-time  is  a  fundamental  participant  in  the  generation  of

inertial  and  gravitational  forces,  and  as  such  must  be  taken  into  account,  as  well  [5].    Thus,  while  the

energy  content  of  matter  may  indeed  be  largely  ZPF-induced,  one  must  still  explain  why  energy  resists

acceleration.    On  this  basis,  a  primary  objective  of  the  present  analysis  is  to  provide  an  unequivocal

demonstration  that  the  inertia  of  energy  is  ultimately  a  purely  relativistic  manifestation  [5].    This  is

achieved by treating the mass, and more generally the energy, of matter as entirely generic, thereby singling

out  the  role  played  by  relativity  while  avoiding  an  introduction  of  zero-point  phenomena.    A  secondary

objective is to demonstrate that forces induced on matter by zero-point radiation are additional body forces

also arising due to the relativistic properties of space-time [5].

In  the  next  Section,  general  relativity  is  used  to  derive  the  proper  force  experienced  by  an  observer

accelerating due to the action of an external force.  This is carried out by expressing the geodesic equation

in accelerating coordinates and taking into account that the accelerating observer remains positioned at the

2

origin  of  the  local  accelerating  coordinate  system  at  all  times.    It  is  also  pointed  out  that  so  long  as  the

observer’s  acceleration  is  uniform,  the  components  of  the  metric  tensor  in  the  accelerating  system  are

independent of time.  Using these observations leads to an expression for the proper force suggesting that

the behavior of space-time in the accelerating system is an active participant in the generation of inertia [5].

Next, the expression for the proper force is used to derive an expression  for the inertial resistance  of  the

accelerating  observer  as  experienced  by  a  force-producing  agent  who  exerts  a  force  on  the  accelerating

observer.  This is done by considering the case of weak, Newtonian acceleration and then using Newton’s

third law of motion to obtain an expression for the reaction force experienced by the force-producing agent.

The resulting expression for the inertial resistance supports a conventional notion that all forms of energy

actively resist acceleration [7]-[8], and suggests that such resistance is purely relativistic in origin [5].

In  Section  3,  special  relativity  is  used  to  derive  the  inertial  resistance  experienced  by  a  stationary

observer,  residing  in  flat  space-time,  who  exerts  a  constant  force  on  a  moving  observer.    Unlike  the

previous  Section,  however,  the  moving  observer  considered  in  this  Section  does  not  undergo  linear

acceleration; rather, the moving observer accelerates tangentially along a circular path of constant radius.

Upon each revolution the moving observer passes by the stationary observer with greater velocity.  From

the  perspective  of  the  stationary  system,  time  in  the  moving  system  appears  increasingly  dilated.    The

change in time dilation arising between the two observers is used to derive  an  expression  for  the  inertial

resistance of the  moving observer.  The resulting expression for the inertial resistance  is  identical  to  that

derived  in  Section  2.    It  is  concluded  that  all  forms  of  energy  possess  inertial  properties,  arising  due  to

relativity [5],[7]-[8].

Section 4 demonstrates that ZPF-induced forces acting on accelerating matter are ultimately relativistic

in  origin,  and  that  such  forces  act  in  addition  to  inertial  forces.    This  is  accomplished  by  considering  a

uniformly accelerating block of matter.  Observers residing on the accelerating block detect a flux of zero-

point radiation passing through the block [4].  The force density due to this flux of radiation is derived for

the case of a small, particle-sized block.  Upon expressing the force in terms of the relativistic Doppler-shift

of  zero-point  radiation  occurring  within  the  accelerating  system,  it  becomes  straightforward  to  see  that

ZPF-induced forces on matter are purely relativistic in origin.  Next, the expression for the force is used to

derive an expression for the total resistance acting on a particle accelerating uniformly through zero-point

radiation.  The form of the resulting expression makes it clear that ZPF-induced forces act in addition to the

inertia of matter.

2.  Proper Force Experienced by a Uniformly Accelerating Observer

As  pointed  out  in  the  Introduction,  general  relativity  suggests  that  inertial  forces  arise  due  to  the

behavior  of  space-time  in  accelerating  systems  [9]-[14].    This  is  demonstrated  herein  by  using  general

relativity to derive the proper 3-force experienced by an accelerating observer.

Let  an  observer  be  accelerating  uniformly  under  the  action  of  a  constant,  external  force.    From  the

vantage  of  the  accelerating  reference  system,  the  observer’s  local  coordinate  system  appears  as  though

3

characterized  by  the  presence  of  a  uniform  gravitational  field  [15].    The  line  element  in  the  local

accelerating coordinate system can be expressed generally in the form

In this expression,  dτ  is an interval of proper time experienced by the accelerating observer and dt is an

The  proper  force  experienced  by  the  accelerating  observer  can  be  derived  by  using  the  geodesic

equation:

Eq. (2), Eq. (4) is easily reduced to

Expressing the Christoffel symbol in terms of the accelerating coordinate system leads directly to

(7) leads to

Next, expressing the second term in terms of a natural logarithm, Eq. (10) can be recast in the form

This is the proper acceleration experienced by the accelerating observer.

Equation (11) can be used to derive an expression for the force experienced by the accelerating observer

upon noticing that the external force acting on the observer is expressible as

where m is the observer’s proper mass.  Using Eq. (12), and simplifying a bit, Eq. (11) then becomes

This is the proper force experienced by the accelerating observer [5].

With  Eq.  (13)  in  hand,  the  inertial  resistance  of  the  observer  can  be  derived.    One  approach  is  to

transform Eq. (13) from the accelerating frame to the reference frame from which the force on the observer

arises.  Another approach is to consider the case of weak acceleration, thereby placing the force within the

Newtonian realm, and then appeal to Newton’s third law of motion.  Choosing the latter approach, one will

notice that when the observer accelerates weakly, the scalar function  dt dτ  assumes values very close to

unity.  For the case of weak acceleration, therefore, the natural logarithm of the scalar function  dt dτ  may

be approximated by use of the expression [18]

Using this approximation in Eq. (13) leads directly to

This  is  the  force  experienced  by  the  accelerating  observer  in  the  limit  of  weak,  Newtonian  acceleration.

Expressing Eq. (15) in vector notation, the force experienced by the accelerating observer becomes

where 

E mc=

2

 has been used, and  ∇∇∇∇  represents the three dimensional gradient operator.  Equation (16)

expresses the force imparted to the accelerating observer by an external force-producing agent.  Assuming

that the force-producing agent resides in an inertial frame, Newton’s third law of motion suggests that the

reaction  force  experienced  by  the  force-producing  agent  is  given  by 

= −

f

in

f .    The  subscript  on 

inf

indicates that the reaction force is due to the inertia of the accelerating observer.  Using this force with Eq.

(16) leads directly to

This is the inertial resistance of the accelerating observer experienced by the force-producing agent [5].  It

is straightforward to see that the inertial resistance is solely dependent upon the total proper energy content

of  the  accelerating  observer  and  the  gradient  of  the  scalar  function  dt dτ   arising  due  to  relativity.    The

form of Eq. (17) suggests that all forms of energy resist acceleration and possess inertial properties which

are  entirely  relativistic  in  origin  [5],[7]-[8].  On  this  basis,  it  may  be  concluded  that  inertia  is  purely

relativistic.

3.  Inertial Resistance of an Observer Accelerating in Flat Space-Time

In  the  previous  Section,  general  relativity  was  used  to  demonstrate  that  all  forms  of  energy  possess

inertial properties arising as purely relativistic manifestations [5],[7]-[8].  In this Section, special relativity

is used to derive the inertial resistance of an observer accelerating uniformly through flat space-time.

Consider a stationary observer residing in an inertial system  S  who applies a force to a second, moving

observer  such  that  the  moving  observer  accelerates  tangentially  along  a  circular  path  of  radius  r.    It  is

envisioned  that  the  stationary  observer  exerts  the  force  on  the  moving  observer  through  the  use  of  some

mechanical  means,  which  exerts  a  constant  torque  on  the  moving  observer.    The  stationary  observer

compares the lengths of time intervals in the moving and stationary systems each time the moving observer

6

reaches  the  point  of  closest  approach;  that  is,  when  the  relative  velocity  is  entirely  transverse.    As  the

moving observer’s velocity increases, the stationary observer finds that time in the moving system becomes

increasingly dilated according to the familiar expression [19]:

where  dt  is a time interval in system  S , and  dτ  is an interval of proper time experienced by the moving
observer.  The stationary observer determines an initial time dilation  (

dt dτ ; and then at some later time,

)

i

the stationary observer determines a final time dilation (

The  inertial  resistance  of  the  moving  observer  can  be  derived  by  first  using  Eqs.  (19)  to  express  the

derive the inertial resistance by use of Eq. (20), one will notice that the change in the scalar function  dt dτ

on the left hand side of Eq. (20) may be expressed as a line integral of the form

where  dl  is an infinitesimal length vector aligned along the circular path on  which  the  moving  observer

travels.  Also, the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq. (20) can be expressed as

It  is  now  straightforward  to  see  that  the  integrand  on  the  RHS  of  this  expression  contains  the  familiar

This is the inertial resistance of the moving observer, experienced by the stationary observer residing in flat

space-time  [5].    The  form  of  Eq.  (30)  is  identical  to  that  of  Eq.  (17),  derived  on  the  basis  of  general

relativity,  and  suggests  that  all  forms  of  energy,  regardless  of  embodiment,  exhibit  inertial  properties

arising as purely relativistic phenomena [5],[7]-[8].

4.  Resistance Force on Accelerating Matter due to Zero-Point

Radiation

According to the preceding Sections, special and general relativity suggest that the inertial properties of

matter,  as  well  as  of  all  other  forms  of  energy,  are  purely  relativistic  in  origin.    In  this  Section,  it  is

demonstrated  that  forces  induced  on  matter  through  interaction  with  zero-point  radiation  are  ultimately

relativistic in origin, and that such forces arise in addition to inertial forces.

Consider a block of matter, of proper volume  V , undergoing uniform acceleration through flat space-

time due to an external force.  Observers residing on the block detect a flux of zero-point radiation entering

the block through the front side, which may be called wall A, and passing out of the block through the back

side, called wall B.  According to these observers, the radiation within the volume of the block possesses a

momentum density of the form

where 

AS  and 

BS  are Poynting vectors corresponding to the flux of zero-point radiation detected at walls

A and B, respectively.  While the block accelerates, the Poynting vectors are not equal in magnitude; zero-

point radiation becomes Doppler-shifted as it passes through the accelerating frame of the block.  Taking

this into consideration, the Poynting vectors may be expressed in terms of the energy density of the  ZPF

observed at each wall:

where the subscripts A and B indicate the walls at which the energy density of the ZPF is detected, and n is

a unit vector pointing in the direction of the block's acceleration.  Since the block is accelerating, zero-point

radiation gains energy as it passes from wall A to wall B.  As a result, radiation detected at wall B appears

blue-shifted relative to radiation detected at wall A.  Taking this into account, the Poynting vector given by

Eq. (32b) can be expressed as

where 

Adτ  and 

Bdτ  are intervals of proper time experienced by the observers situated at  walls A and B,

respectively.  Using Eqs. (32a) and (33) in Eq. (31), the momentum density of zero-point radiation within

the block becomes

block’s acceleration, observers positioned at  wall  A can express  τ∆  in terms of  the  block's  length,

where  u  is the proper energy density of the ZPF according to observers moving with the particle.

Equation  (38)  expresses  the  force  density  due  to  zero-point  radiation  passing  through  and  interacting

with a particle of matter undergoing substantial acceleration.  It will be noticed that Eq. (38) is substantially

similar to Eq. (13) of Section 2.  In Section 2, it was pointed out that  when the acceleration is  weak, the

scalar function  dt dτ  can be approximated by use of the expression given by Eq. (14).  Upon using Eq.

(14) with the force density, embodied by Eq. (38), one immediately obtains [5]-[6]

Upon  transforming  this  expression  from  the  accelerating  system  to  the  inertial  frame  from  which  the

external force on the particle arises, the force density becomes [5]-[6]

where  the  prime  has  been  dropped  from 

′ffff   for  simplicity.    Equation  (40)  is  a  resistance  force  on  the

particle due to interaction with zero-point radiation.

According to a force-producing observer residing in flat space-time, when an external force is applied

to the particle, a resistance force  ZPF

f

 arises due to interaction between the particle and zero-point radiation.

Using Eq. (40), such as observer can express this resistance force as

where  V  is the proper volume of the accelerating particle.  Equation (41) gives the resistance force acting

on the accelerating particle due to the scattering of zero-point radiation.  According to Eq. (41), the force on

the particle arises not only due to the presence of zero-point radiation, but also due to the gradient of the

scalar  function  dt dτ .    It  is  interesting  to  note  that  when  the  scalar  function  dt dτ   assumes  a  constant

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

value (i.e., the particle is no longer accelerating), the force given by Eq. (41) is then zero.  This suggests

that while zero-point phenomena may give rise to a large portion of the mass-energy content of matter, the

inertia of such energy is purely relativistic [5].

At this point, it is  worthwhile to show that Eq. (41) can be used  to derive  an  expression  for  the  total

resistance force acting on the accelerating particle discussed above.  According to the ZPF proposal, when

a material body undergoes acceleration due to an external force, the quarks and electrons constituting the

body  scatter  a  portion  of  the  zero-point  radiation  passing  through  the  body.    The  scattered  portion  of

radiation imparts an energy density to the accelerating body, which is expressed in the form [4]

In this expression,

interacts  with  the  accelerating  body.    Those  who  support  the  ZPF  proposal  interpret  the  energy  density,

given by Eq. (42), as the sole origin of the inertial  mass of  matter [3]-[4].  However, as discussed in the

Introduction, another form of energy that must be taken into account is the intrinsic proper mass-energy of

the  accelerating  body  [5]-[8].    On  this  basis,  the  total  energy  content  of  the  body  must  be  expressed  as

additional  forms  of  energy  that  may  be  present.    Using  this  expression  for  the  accelerating  particle

discussed above leads to

In order to derive an expression for the total resistance force acting of the accelerating particle, Eq. (41)

must be amended to include all forms of energy possessed by the particle [7]-[8].  This calls for replacing

uV  in Eq. (41) with the total energy given by Eq. (43).  Carrying this out gives the force in the form

This expresses the total resistance force acting on the uniformly accelerating particle.

Equation  (44)  can  be  simplified  by  considering  the  case  of  weak,  uniform  acceleration  along  the

x − coordinate axis of an inertial system.  For this case, the scalar function  dt dτ  may be expressed in the

Equation  (47)  is  the  total  resistance  force  acting  on  a  particle  of  proper  mass  m  that  accelerates

uniformly through zero-point radiation.  With the exclusion of the first and last terms, Eq. (47) is identical

to an expression for the force derived on the basis of ZPF theory [4].  Supporters of the ZPF proposal claim

that  the  inertial  mass  of  accelerating  matter  ought  to  be  expressed  entirely  by  the  expression  within

parentheses,  in  the  second  term  of  Eq.  (47).    Clearly,  this  can  be  the  case  only  if  the  energy  content  of

matter  is  entirely  due  to  ZPF-induced  zitterbewegung  [4]  of  the  subatomic  particles  comprising  matter,

thereby allowing one to drop the first and last terms in Eq. (47).  According to the Introduction, however,

one  cannot  disregard  the  intrinsic  mass-energy  content  of  matter.    As  shown  herein,  the  intrinsic  mass-

energy content of matter gives rise inertial phenomena arising solely due the relativistic properties of space-

time [5].  Based on this, it appears that the only way to reconcile the intrinsic inertial properties of ordinary

matter with the ZPF proposal is to accept that ZPF-induced forces are resistive forces acting in addition to

inertia.

5.  Discussion and Conclusions

One approach to the problem of inertia has  been  an  attempt  to  express  the  inertial  mass  appearing  in

Newton's  second  law  of  motion  in  terms  of  some  other  more  fundamental  entity  or  interaction.    An

increasingly popular, and very appealing, approach to this end is the zero-point field (ZPF) proposal, which

asserts  that  inertia  and  gravitation  arise  due  to  scattering  of  zero-point  radiation  by  quarks  and  electrons

constituting ordinary matter [3]-[4]. An objective of the present analysis, however, has been to show that

the inertial properties of ordinary matter are ultimately relativistic in origin [5].

As  pointed  out  in  the  Introduction,  general  relativity  asserts  that  the  forces  of  gravitation  and  inertia

arise  directly  out  the  structure  of  space-time  [9]-[14].    Based  on  this,  both  special  and  general  relativity

were used to derive an expression for the inertial resistance of an observer undergoing acceleration due to

an external force.  Both approaches led to an expression for the inertial resistance suggesting that all forms

13

of  energy  possess  inertial  properties  manifesting  chiefly  due  to  the  relativistic  properties  of  space-time

[5],[7]-[8].  Although electromagnetic zero-point phenomena may well be the origin of the energy content

of  matter  [4],  neither  of  the  above-mentioned  approaches  required  a  specific  appeal  to  zero-point

phenomena.  On this basis, it was concluded that inertia is a purely relativistic manifestation [5].

Another objective of the present analysis was to demonstrate that forces induced on matter due to zero-

point radiation are additional body forces arising due to the relativistic properties of space-time.  This was

carried out by deriving the resistance force acting on an accelerating block of matter that scatters a portion

of the zero-point radiation passing through the block.  Expressing the force in terms of the Doppler-shift of

radiation  in  the  accelerating  system  led  directly  to  an  expression  for  the  force  identical  to  that  derived

herein on the basis of special and general relativity.  In addition, the expression for the force was used in

conjunction  with  an  expression  for  the  energy  density  of  zero-point  radiation  that  interacts  with  an

accelerating particle [4].  This led to an expression suggesting that ZPF-induced forces are resistive forces

acting in addition to inertia.

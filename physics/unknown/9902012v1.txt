The Hydrogen Atom of Bohr I:

Own Life Time of an Excited Single Atom.

P. S. Kamenov

Many of the authors think that the theory of Bohr about the hydrogen atom is

not adequate to reality. Bohr himself thinks (and writes) that, though his model of

hydrogen describes some properties of this atom very well, it can not be accepted
as realistic... Now it is considered to be almost a shame to think about this model
as  corresponding  to  reality.  Some  textbooks  for  students  discuss  this  model  of

Bohr,  but  only  as  a  curious  example  of  an  inadequate  model  which  can  lead  to

some true results[1]...

In  this  paper I hope to show that this understanding has no foundations.  It

stems from some mystic assumption about quantum physics [2]...For example, the

complementarity  principle  postulated  by  Niels  Bohr  [3]  in  1927,  assumes  that  the

wave-particle  "duality"  is  a  property  of  a  single  quantum  system  and  therefore  its

two  complementary  aspects  cannot  be  measured  simultaneously;  In  some

experiments (interference, diffraction) wave properties are manifested, some other

experiments  provide  evidence  for  the  corpuscular  properties  of  quantum  objects

(impulse, energy). It  is  impossible  to  observe  the  two  phenomena  simultaneously
and, moreover, they cannot exist simultaneously ... In the paper [4]  it  was  shown

that in the case of waves on the surface of a liquid the floating classical particles

which pass through only one of the two opened slits are guided by the interfering

surface  waves  in  the  same  directions  as  predicted  by  quantum  laws.  This  is  a
confirmation of de Broglie's ideas that wave and particle exist simultaneously and

that this coexistence is real  [5].  Most  of  the  scientists  think  that  the  field  of  de

Broglie  is  not  real  and  they  accept  the  statistical  interpretation  of  Born  [6].  I  ask

myself  why  the  assumption  that  a  wave-particle  can  not  exist  simultaneously  is
more  real  than  de  Broglie's  assumption  that  they  always exist simultaneously
[5]?. De Broglie's waves in the hydrogen atoms are such that in the stationary state
the mass of the electron (m), its velocity vn , and average radius rn are related with
the principal quantum number (n= 1,2,3....) according to:

(1)                              mvnrn=n

h
2p

=nh

and the field-particle (electron) is in a potential well which guides the electron
only in orbit n, in which case the electron does not emit photons. The length of de
Broglie's wave l

n exactly satisfies the condition

The "wave-particle" electron is bound together with the "wave-particle" proton

by  electromagnetic  forces.  They  interfere  and  remain  in  their    potential  well

(position) forever, like classical particles  on  the  surface  of  a  liquid  [4].The  field  of

de  Broglie  is  so  real  and  this  reality  is  so  strong  that  the  electromagnetic  forces

can  not  destroy  this  interference  and  the  field-particle  (electron)  can  not  emit  a

photon-soliton  [7,8].  In  order  to  explain  the  decay  of  a  stationary  state  it  is

necessary  to  assume  some  infinitely  small  "external  perturbation"  which  would

disturb  the  exact  equalities  (1)  and  (2)  and  (after  some  time  of  destructive
interference) permit the transition to lower states. Only the ground state (2p
1;
n=1)  can  not  be  disturbed  by  a  "infinitely  small  perturbation"  because  the  field-

r1=l

particle can not be destroyed (n can not be smaller than 1). In this case only if the

perturbation energy is sufficiently  great,  the  electron  can  make  a  transition  from
the ground to the upper levels (absorption only, [9]). Excited by some energy, the
electron  can  randomly  occur  at  any  distance  ( rni) around  the  exact  radius  of  the
stationary orbit (2p
;). We can imagine that the "wave-particle" electron self-
interferes  as  long  as  the  minima  of  the  wave  coincide  with  the  maxima  of  the
2 =
; D is the amplitude of the interfering
precedent waves (this means that

greater  the  difference  r
,  the  smaller  the  time  necessary  for  destructive
ni
ﬁ 0, the time for destructive interference would be very long

[10]. It seems that all particles (including photons [7,8]) must have a charge

which I call "charge of de Broglie". This charge creates a monochromatic
wave with the length of the wave of de Broglie l = h
/ mv. As it is known, all
other  fields  created  by  charged  particles  (when  moving  with  constant
velocity v) can be represented by monochromatic waves with this l .

Return to Bohr's atom and the real field-particle of de Broglie.
In  Fig.1 a schematic wave-particle in some excited state of the hydrogen atom is

shown.  The  particle-wave  electron  moves  from  left  to  right  (for  example,  n=2).  In
Fig.1 a) the velocity of the electron vn is such that  l
n and rn correspond exactly to
Bohr's conditions:

nmv

Such  a  wave-particle  electron  returns  from  the  left  always  with  the  same

phase  and  reiterates  its  motion  for  an  infinitely  long  time.  If  the  velocity  of  the
electron (v) is slightly different, the new  l
with l

 will also be slightly different (compared

n):

(4)                         l =

mv

Such  a  particle-wave  electron  would  arrive  from  the  left  (Fig.  1  b))  with  a

slightly  different  phase.  With  time  this  difference  increases  and  we  can  calculate

the moment when the sum of two amplitudes becomes zero (for the first time). In

this moment the electron is not more in the potential well of the wave (like classical
particles, [4], when  D 2
0= ) and is allowed to change its position. This moment will

be  the  time  of  life  of  this  excited  atom.  The  sum  of  the  two  amplitudes  of  de

Broglie' field (D) can be written (like with classical particles, [4]):

where the energy can be measured in units eV and h

 [eV.s]. In this case the

energy  of  the  different  excited  states  can  be  expressed  through  the  Rydberg

constant (R). Thus, the life time of each single excited hydrogen atom depends on
the small energy difference (D E) and the principal quantum number (n):

Part  of  the  results  are  shown  in  the  Fig.2.  These  curves  are  different  for

different  excited  states  (n).  They  could  be  compared  with  the  normalized  "own
lifetimes"  of  nuclei  (t / t   and  D E /G
mean life time (t

)    [10].  Like  in  this  work  [10],  one  can  find  the

For  n=2  ,  t

n =1.603x10-9  s,  which  coincides  exactly  with  the  data  from  [11]

(where t

n =1.60x10-9 s).

Conclusions.  These  results  show  that  if  one  accepts  de  Broglie's
assertion about the reality of the unitary wave-particle, the excited single hydrogen

atom decays (after excitation) in an exactly predictable moment (17); this moment
depends upon the small energy difference (D E) between the stationary energy
level and the individual excitation energy. The mean life time (t
n) is a characteristic
only of a statistical ensemble of excited atoms.  The  complementarity  principle  is

not  necessary,  and  the  statistical  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics  should  be

applied  only  to  ensembles  of  atoms.  The  experimental  proof  of  these  results  is

possible with the help of resonant Mossbauer experiments in the time domain, as it

was mentioned in [10].

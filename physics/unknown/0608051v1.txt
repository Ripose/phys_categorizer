Abstract.  Magnetic  Monopole  is  a  consequence  of  the  existence  of  the  duality  symmetry  in 
electrodynamics. Although, no conclusive experimental evidences have so far been found but the 
subject is still of much interest to physicists. The theory of magnetic monopoles was first proposed 
by Dirac in 1931 and soon after it was studied by physicist of many disciplines specially particle 
physics, quantum filed theory and the non-linear Soliton equations. One important consequence of 
the magnetic monopole theory is the quantization of the electric charge which was first derived by 
Dirac.  In  the  definition  of  the  classical  magnetic  monopole,  the  concept  of  Dirac  string  is  used. 
Dirac string is the locus of the points where the vector potential is not well-behaved. On the other 
hand  by  introducing  the  idea  of  magnetic  monopoles,  Maxwell's  equations  became  symmetrical 
with respect to the magnetic and electric fields, but they still remain unsymmetrical as far as the 
scalar  and  the  vector  potentials  are  concerned.  In  this  work  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  are 
redefined in terms of some new scalar and vector potentials, respectively, as a result of which the 
Maxwell’s  equations  become  symmetrical  with  respect  to  the  potentials  too.  One  advantage  of 
using this formulation is that one can discard the Dirac string all together. Finally, definition of the 
new potentials guarantees the Lorentz invariance of equations.

1. Introduction 

The  concept  of  symmetry  plays  a  central  role  in  Physics  and  other  fields  of  science  [1]. 
Moreover educationally, it is essential for students to know the various aspects of the phenomena. 
Symmetry,  apart  from  its  aesthetic  aspects  is  a  powerful  tool  in  predicting  and  forecasting 
physical laws and effects, something which makes it all more important for students to learn. The 
application  of  symmetry  in  predicting  new  particles  is  a  well  known  technique  e.g.  Lorentz 
invariance of the quantum mechanical equations of particles led to the prediction of anti-particles 
in  1930.  In  1993  anti-electrons  (positrons)  were  discovered  by  C.  D.  Anderson  [2].  Magnetic 
monopole  is  also  an  important  fundamental  particle  whose  existence  is  postulated  based  on  the 
duality  symmetry.  Although  so  far  no  experiments  have  revealed  such  particles  but  some 
physicists are hoping that these particles can experimentally be detected in future.  
The quantization of the electric charges is an important consequence of the investigation of the 
dual  symmetry  in  quantum  electrodynamics,  by  Dirac  [3].  In  his  work  the  vector  potential  was 
singular  and  he  considered  the  concept  of  Dirac  string  in  the  formulation  [4].  In  this  work  the 
duality symmetry is re-examined and it is shown that the singularities originate from the lack of 
the  dual  symmetry  in  the  definition  of  the  electromagnetic  fields  in  terms  of  potentials. 
Symmetrization    of  the  Maxwell’s  equations  with  regards  to  the  potentials  would  result  in  the 
definition of  new scalar and vector potentials.

then the Gauss’ law for the electric charges would no longer hold because 

                                               (7) 
To resolve this, Dirac used a singular vector potential. He first considered the integral form of the 
Gauss’  law  for  a  magnetic  field  over  an  open  surface.  A  Gaussian  open  surface  is  defined  as  a 
sphere which has a hole of radius  R  cut out of it (see Fig. 1)

Now  the  radius  R  is  let  to  tend  to  zero  till  a  singular  point  is  obtained  on  the  surface.  In  the 
obtained singular point the vector potential is not well-defined. As an example, in a convenient 
gauge or with a suitable choice of a vector potential, e.g.,

the  singularity  would  end  up  on  the  Z-axis  ( 
0=θ ).  However  one  can  find  many  Gaussian 
spherical surfaces which would have the magnetic charge in their center and a singular point on 
their  surface.  The  locus  of  such  singular  points  would  form  a  line  or  string  which  is  known  as 
Dirac  string.  In  another  word  in  this  method  a  singular  string  is  attached  to  each  magnetic 
monopole, which stretches from the monopole to infinity.  
Unlike  electromagnetic  fields,  potentials  are  not  measurable  quantities  and  in  spite  of  having 
singularities in the potentials the electromagnetic fields are not singular themselves. However the 
Hamiltonian  of  an  interacting  charged  particle  with  external  electromagnetic  fields  explicitly 
depends on the electromagnetic potentials

therefore,  in  quantum  electrodynamics  the  Schrödinger's  equation  for  a  charged  particle 
interacting  with  the  electromagnetic  fields  of  a  magnetic  monopole  would  be  a  singular 
differential equation. On the other hand, using the definition of electromagnetic fields in terms of 
ordinary potentials, Eq. (6) results in non-symmetrical Maxwell’s equations. In another word the 
Maxwell's equations do not have the duality symmetry with respect to the ordinary potentials.

Evidently, Eqs. (18) and (19) lead to Eq. (2). 
From  the  symmetric  Maxwell’s  equations 
one  may  conclude  that  a  moving  electric  charge 
particle  gives  rise  to  an  electric  field  and  symmetrically,  a  moving  magnetic  charged  particle 
would also give rise to an electric field (see Figures 3 and 4). The electric and magnetic fields in 
Eq. (12) would now split in to longitudinal and transversal fields as given below

In Eq. (20) the indices L and T denote the longitudinal and transverse components, respectively. 
The  longitudinal  electric  and  the  transversal  magnetic  fields  are  produced  by  a  moving  electric 
charge,  while  the  longitudinal  magnetic  and  the  transversal  electric  fields  are  produced  by  a 
moving magnetic charged particle. The duality symmetry (5) can clearly be seen in figures 3 and

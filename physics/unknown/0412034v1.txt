We  reveal  the  existence  of  dynamically  stable  composite  topological  solitons  in  Bessel 

photonic  lattices  imprinted  in  focusing  Kerr-type  nonlinear  media.  The  new  stable 

composite  solitons  are  made  of  a  vortex-ring  with  unit  topological  charge  incoherently 

coupled to a fundamental soliton. The stabilization of the otherwise highly azimuthally 

unstable vortex-rings is provided under suitable conditions, which we study in detail, by 

cross-phase-modulation coupling with the fundamental soliton companion.

Bright vortex solitons or vortex-rings, which contain a phase singularity nested in 

a ring shaped beam and that carry orbital angular momentum, appear in many systems 

modeled  by  focusing  nonlinearities.  However  in  homogeneous  self-focusing  media  they 

typically undergo symmetry-breaking instabilities and self-fragment themselves into sets 

of  fundamental  solitons  which  fly  off  the  initial  ring  profile.1-10  Stabilization  of  such 

beams  has  been  predicted  theoretically  in  the  models  with  competing  cubic-quintic  or 

quadratic-cubic nonlinearities (see Refs. [11-14] and references therein). Stabilization via 

nonlinearity management was proposed recently in Bose-Einstein condensates.15 Ref. [16] 

suggests a novel scheme for stabilization of vortex solitons by placing them on a defect 

in  photonic  crystal  fiber.  Two  additional  different  approaches  that  have  been  put 

forward in the search of stabilization are the incoherent coupling of a vortex-ring with a 

bright soliton via a cross-phase-modulation thus forming composite solitons in saturable 

focusing media,17-20 and the utilization of photonic lattices.21-23 In this paper we discover a 

new  possibility  that  is  possible  because  of  the  ingredients  that  come  from  both  these 

approaches.

Spatial modulation of the linear refractive index profoundly affects the diffraction 

properties  of  the  beams  and  thus  the  properties  of  solitons,  including  the  vortex  ones. 

Lattice  soliton  formation  was  experimentally  demonstrated  in  photorefractive  crystals 

where  modulation  of  refractive  index  can  be  created  optically.24-30  If  refractive  index 

modulation is deep enough, as a consequence creating an array of evanescently coupled 

waveguides,  the  formation  of  discrete  solitons  strongly  localized  in  neighboring  array 

sites  is  possible.31,32  Recently  experimental  observation  of  discrete  vortex  solitons  in 

optically  induced  photonic  lattices  was  reported21,22  and  the  strong  stabilizing  action  of 

the lattice was confirmed.23 To date the main stream of activity was related to periodical 

optical lattices with a rectangular, or honeycomb symmetry, that are induced by several 

interfering plane waves. However, Bessel photonic lattices with the cylindrical symmetry 

are  very  attractive  because  they  introduce  a  new  cylindrical  symmetry,  and  can  be 

induced by corresponding non-diffracting beams. Recently we reported salient properties 

of single-spot and dipole-mode solitons in such lattices imprinted in focusing media and 

presented reach variety of in-ring and inter-ring rotating soliton interactions.33,34 

In this paper we introduce the new family of bright composite vortex solitons in 

Bessel photonic lattices imprinted in focusing Kerr-type medium. We found that even in 

the  absence  of  nonlinearity  saturation,  the  cross-phase-modulation  coupling with  stable 

vorticityless  component  stabilizes  vortex  component  with  unit  topological  charge.  Such 

suppression of the azimuthal modulational instability of composite vortex solitons serves 

as an illuminating example of Bessel photonic lattices applications. 

We address the propagation of two incoherently coupled laser beams along the  z  

axis in a bulk medium with the focusing cubic nonlinearity and transverse modulation of 

refractive index described by the system of coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations for 

dimensionless light field amplitudes  1,2q :

nondiffracting zero-order Bessel beam. Such kind of beams can be formed experimentally 

by  means  of  axicones  or  computer  generated  holograms.  The  lattice  refractive  index 

profile  is  proportional  to  the  intensity  of  the  zero-order  Bessel  beam  as  it  occurs  in 

photorefractive  crystals  and  Bose-Einstein  condensates  (Fig.  1(a)).  The  depth  of 

refractive  index  modulation  in  the  lattice  is  assumed  to  be  small  compared  with  the 

unperturbed index and is of the order of nonlinear contribution to the refractive index. If 

vector  soliton  components  launched  into  a  slow  Kerr-type  medium  share  the  same 

polarization,  which  is  orthogonal  to  polarization  of  lattice-creating  beam,  they  will  fill 

the  same  lattice  formed  by  the  nondiffracting  Bessel  beam.  Among  the  conserved

vortex  solitons  become  spatially  extended  and  cover  many  lattice  rings  as  the 

propagation  constant  approaches  the  cut-off  value  for  soliton  existence.  Typically  the 

cut-off  for  vortex  solitons  is  lower  than  that  for  fundamental  soliton.  At  high  energy 

flows solitons of both types are localized primarily in the central guiding core of Bessel 

lattice.  

We  have  found  a  rich  variety  of  composite  lattice  solitons  with  different 

combinations  of  topological  charges

This  value  monotonically  increases  with  growth  of  the  lattice  depth  p .  Since  lower 

amplitudes  are  necessary  to  support  soliton  propagation  in  the  presence  of  lattice, 

amplitudes 

1,2w   decrease  with  growth  of  p   at  fixed  total  energy  flow,  while  radial 
oscillations  on  soliton  profile  due  to  the  refractive  index  modulation  become  more

Since the second vorticityless component would be linearly stable in Bessel lattice 

in  the  absence  of  the  first  vortex  component,  it  is  expectable  that  second  component 

might  have  strong  stabilizing  action  on  the  first  component  via  the  cross-phase 

modulation, at least near the lower cut-off  lowb
where 

1w  is small. We have found that this is the case by solving the linear eigenvalue 
. The real part of growth rate can be nonzero only for

The  central  result  of  this  paper  is  that  composite  vortex  solitons  are  free  from 

instabilities in a considerable part of their existence domain close to the lower cut-off on

development  of  the  azimuthal  instability  of  the  vortex  component.  In  other  words,  the 

presence of the robust and self-restoring vorticityless component is crucial to provide a 

dumping  feedback  for  azimuthal  perturbations.  For  a  fixed  lattice  depth  the  stability 

domain  broadens  with  growth  of  the  amplitude  of  vorticityless  component  (or, 

equivalently,  with  growth  of 

2b ,  Fig.  2(c)).  It  is  important  to  note  that  close  to  the 
critical for stabilization value of the propagation constant  crb  the energy flow carried by 
the vortex component of stable composite soliton can exceed that carried by vorticityless 

component.  In  this  case vortex  component  cannot  be  considered just  as linear  mode of 

the waveguide created by the lattice and the relatively intensive vorticityless component.

existence of vector solitons at given  2b .

of  unstable  composite  solitons  in  the  lattice  is  accompanied  by  intense  radiation  and 

growing oscillations of the amplitude of vortex component (Fig. 3(a)). Asymptotically it 

results in formation of simplest vector soliton, whose components have no vorticity and 

feature the same functional profiles with maximums located at 

r = . For stable vector 

0

solitons direct simulations of Eq. (1) entirely confirm results of linear stability analysis. 

In the presence of noise stable solitons conserve their input structure for hundreds of the 

diffraction lengths as shown in Fig. 3(b). 

 

We thus conclude that the analysis of the properties of composite vortex solitons 

in  Bessel  photonic  lattices  reveals  that  the  cross-phase-modulation  incoherent  coupling 

with  stable  vorticityless  component  leads  to  stabilization  of  the  otherwise  unstable 

vortex  soliton  with  unit  topological  charge.  Results  reported  here  are  expected  to  hold 

for  more  general  settings,  e.g.  more  complicated  lattices  with  radial  symmetry,  and 

higher values of cross-phase-modulation strength. We stress that the predicted existence 

of stable composite vortex solitons, which do not self-destroy by azimuthal modulational 

instabilities, is another important example of the unique phenomena afforded by Bessel 

photonic lattices.

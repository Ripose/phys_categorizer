scale by period doubling in three and four dimensions

One of the  most  interesting questions in  modern  physics  is the possible relation of the
Planck scale to our perceived world. The Planck energy (1022 MeV) is extremely large
as compared to the rest energies of the elementary particles and the Planck length (10  35
m)  is  too  short  to  be  directly  connected  to  any  real  world  distances.  Why  the  Planck
scale is interesting is that it is absolute, as it is determined by the natural constants h, c,
G  and e o.  Another  reason  is  that  the  Planck  scale  may  represent  the  ultimate
“graininess”, i.e. the basic structure, of the space time and matter.
It is  well known that nonlinear systems  show universal  behavior  in the  form of period
doubling,  which  is  the  same  as  frequency  and  energy  halving.  If  period  doubling  is
applied  to the  Planck  energy Eo=h/to,  an  absolute  and  unadjustable  set  of  sublevels  is
borne. Spatial period doubling will correspondingly yield a set of increasing lengths.
The  rest  energy  of  the  electron positron  pair  is  given  directly  by  a  Planck  energy
sublevel, whereas the nucleon rest energies originate from a sum energy of two adjacent
sublevels.
It  is  also  shown  that  the  value  of  the  elementary  electric  charge  squared,  which  is
proportional  to  energy,  results  from  the  Planck  charge  squared  by  the  same  period
doubling process.
It is further shown that the planets in the Solar system occupy orbits, the radii of which
can  be  calculated  from  the  Planck  length  by  spatial  period  doubling.  A  spectrum  of
velocities  can  be  calculated  from  the  speed  of  light  by  the  same  process.  These
velocities fit the consequent orbital velocities of the planets and the quantized redshifts
of galaxies, if redshift is interpreted as velocity.
A hypothesis is made that the invariant properties and structures of matter are related to
periodic structures obtained by a period doubling process in three and four dimensional
nonlinear systems.

INTRODUCTION

The  Planck  scale  is  a  natural  starting  point  for  studies  of  space time  structures,  since  the
Planck  length  and  time  are  determined  by  natural  constants.  The  difficulty  is  in  that  the
Planck  energy  (1022  MeV)  is  far  too  large  as  compared  to  e.g.  the  electron  (0.511 MeV) or
proton (938 MeV) to indicate any direct and simple connection between these energies. It has
also  been  difficult  to  relate  the  Planck  charge  and  the  elementary  charge,  although  their
magnitudes are not so different.
Observations  may point to some kind of a  large scale quantization.  W.  G. Tifft  first pointed
out that the redshifts of nearby galaxies are quantized [1]. There is also the Bode Titius rule
rn=0.4+0.3.2n, which may point to some underlying order in our Solar system.
M. Feigenbaum in his article [2] states that “various Hamiltonian systems ... such as the Solar
system  –  can  come  under  this  discipline  …   as  an  external  parameter  (temperature,  for
example) is varied” …  “... That is, the period has doubled to 2t”.
The process of period doubling  means exact  frequency  and  energy  halving according to the
Planck relation E = hf = h/period. The fundamental frequency or energy of the system may be
arbitrarily high,  but the period doubling process will generate a series of subfrequencies and
subenergies  finally  reaching  energy  levels  encountered  in  our  material  world.  Lengths  or
distances, which fit our perceived world, result from spatial period doubling.
Another  important  property  of  a  non linear  system  is  the  generation  of  sum  and  difference
frequencies.  This means that single subenergies mix and form new energy levels.
The  universe  is  also  dynamic  and  for  a  holistic  picture  we  shall  need  both  a  model  for  the
invariant  properties  of  matter  and  the  dynamics of the  universe.  T.  Suntola  [3]  has  recently
developed  a  four dimensional  model of the dynamical universe, where the  fourth dimension
has  a  spatial  nature  and  the  rest  energy  of  mass  (E=mc2)  is  due  to  the  expansion  of  the
universe  in  the  fourth  dimension  at  the  speed  of  light.  In  this  model  our  3 dimensional
universe is the surface of a 4 sphere. A fourth dimension will be needed for the electric charge
in the model represented in this article.
The occurrence of a possible period doubling process in nature was studied by A. Lehto [4,5],
who  found  out  that  several  energies,  distances  and  velocities  fitted  rather  nicely  into  a
doubling  scheme  in  three  dimensions.  He  interpreted  the  findings  to  show  that  time  has  a
multidimensional periodic nature related to the stationary properties of matter.
It is the purpose of this article to suggest that invariant properties and structures of matter may
result  from  a  period  doubling  process  in  three  and  four  dimensions,  when  applied  to  the
Planck scale.
We  shall  first  develop  the  mathematical  model  and  then  compare  the  model  with  the
elementary  particle  properties,  Solar  system,  redshifts  of  galaxies,  cosmic  background
temperature, cosmic radiation and some other topics.

2 MODEL

The  fundamental  quantities  are  the  Planck  mass mo  and  charge qo,  from  which  the  Planck
length,  period  (and  frequency),  mass energy,  electrostatic  Coulomb energy  and  elementary
electric charge can be derived.
The number of the Planck energy sublevels and their combinations is huge. Because there are
only a few stable particles, we conclude that not all of the sublevels are occupied. Therefore
selection  rules  for  stable  occupation  must  exist.  By  occupation  we  mean  attaching  electric

charge(s) to a sublevel in  which process  an energetic charged object  is  borne. The object  is
electrically neutral, if the charges cancel.
We shall start the development of the model by defining the Planck scale needed.

Equations  (1)  and  (2)  define  the  Planck  scale  for  structures  in  the  periodic  space time.
Equation  (3)  is  the  Planck  relation E=hf,  where f=c/lo  and lo  is  interpreted  as  wavelength
(=corresponding to one period).  Equation (4) defines the Planck charge squared, because this
is  proportional  to  energy.  The  unit  current,  defined  by  equation  (5),  is  not  strictly  a  Planck
scale current, since the elementary charge is used instead of the Planck charge.

Part  of  the  rest  energy  of  charged  particles  is  contained  in  their  electric  fields  and  the
electrostatic (Coulomb) energy for the elementary charge can be calculated from equation (6).
The unit value is shown in Table I, although it is not strictly a Planck scale unit either.
The gravitational constant G  is the  main  source of  inaccuracy  in the Planck scale units. The
relative  standard  uncertainty  of G  is  150  ppm  and  hence  that  of  the  Planck  energy,  length,
magnetic  moment  and  temperature  75  ppm.  The  values  of  the  natural  constants  have  been
adopted from the NIST table of natural constants [6].

2.2 Basic formulae
If xm and xn belong to a doubling sequence, then their ratio R is of the form R = x m/x n  =2 ± n. It
was shown in [4] that an observer perceives the geometric mean of the periods and therefore
the perceived number of doublings is either of the form n = N/3, or n = N/4, where N, the total
number  of  doublings,  is  an  integer.  The  process  of  period  doubling  in  three  and  four
dimensions  offers  very  simple  formulae  for  the  calculation  of  the  perceived  values  of  the
physical properties of the objects corresponding to their periodic structure:

The total number of doublings N=i+j+k will be denoted by (i, j, k), which also refers to the

The  rest  energy  of  particles  may  be  determined  by  a  single  Planck  energy  sublevel.  These
particles  will  be  called  single level  particles.  Particles,  whose  rest  energy  is  determined  by
two sublevels, will be called double level particles and so forth.

Separation of adjacent levels

2.4
In  the  three  dimensional  system  the  adjacent  values Xi=2iXo  and Xj=2jXo  (j=i+0.333)  are
separated  by  a  factor  of  20.333,  which  means  that  (Xj Xi)/Xi=260000  ppm  and  (Xi 
Xj)/Xi=210000 ppm. The separation is correspondingly 190000 ppm and 160000 ppm in four
dimensions. X  is  any  quantity  in  equations  (7) (14).    The difference  between  the  calculated
and experimental values (in chapter 3) may be compared with these level separations.

2.5 Density of states
The  perceived  density  of  the  Planck  energy  sublevels  or  states, D(E)= D n/D En,  can  be
calculated from equations.(7) and (8) by solving for n. The (absolute) density of states is

where i  is  3  or  4  depending  on  the  number  of  dimensions.  Equation  (15)  shows  that  the
density of states grows exponentially with n. The perceived Planck scale 3 d density of states
is D(E)=1.4.10 28 (1/eV).

Superstability

2.6
The result of a period doubling process is a quantized system with exact values. Considering
transitions it is customary to talk about initial and final states. From the operational viewpoint
transition to a new state results from an operation on the initial state.
The 1/x shape of both the Coulomb and gravitational potentials leads to x3=t 2 dependence of x
on t (Keplers’s law). Let us now define volume V as V=x3 and consider (the expanding) V as
driving  force  or  an  operator V  acting  on  the  period t.  According  to V=t 2  the  operation  is
squaring the period. Let us further assume that there is a shortest period to, which doubles (as
space expands) according to t/to=2i, where i is an integer.
The  first  operation  of V  on t/to  yields Vo(t/to)=21  (where o  means  operation),  the  second
operation 
fourth
Vo{Vo[Vo(Vo (t/to))]}=(24)2=2 8 and so forth. The resulting periods can be represented as
22=

third Vo[Vo(Vo(t/to))]=(22)2=24, 

is Vo(Vo(t/to))=(21)2=22,

where i is an integer. This is the result of functional iteration leading to superstable periods, as
shown  by  Feigenbaum  in  [2].  The  total  number  of  doublings  is  of  the  form N=2i.  The
physical interpretation is that the final state of the previous doubling is the initial state for the
next. We will later show in section 3 that the stable structures found in Nature obey equation
(16).

2.7 Particle production
Electron positron  pair  production  from  a  1.022  MeV  gamma  quantum  is  perhaps  the  best
known  example  of  materialization  of  energy.  In  this  article  it  is  assumed  that  this  type  of  a
pair  conversion  process  is  generally  valid  for  the  Planck  energy  levels  obtained  by  period
doubling. The particle production principle  is illustrated in  figure 1. A single sublevel splits
into a pair of energy levels, which become particles when charges are attached. A double level
first splits into a pair of half energy, which materialize into four particles.

Subcharges and magnetic moments

2.8.1 Subcharges

2.8.2 Magnetic moment
Let us now define the magnetic moments m  as
classical current loops in the Planck scale. By
definition  magnetic  moment  equals  current
times the loop area. The loop current is obtained by dividing the elementary charge e by the
period of orbital rotation. Two different  loops, shown  in  figure 2, are defined: a) the orbital
type  denoted  by m oe  with  the  Planck  length lo  as  the  circumference,  and  b)  the  radial  type
denoted by m op with half Planck length lo as the diameter of the loop (as shown by the dotted
line in figure 2 b)).

circumference of the a) loop is lo in the
Bohr sense and the diameter of the b) loop
is lo/2 (i.e. width of potential well ground
state, which is half wavelength).

The  numeric  value  of m op  is  1.9104.10 46
(Am2).  The  factor  2  in  the  denominator  of
equation  (19)  follows  from  the  assumption
that the speed of light cannot be exceeded. If
the  radius  of  the  loop  is lo/4,  then  the
circumference  is 2p( lo/4).  Because  l o/t o=c,
then p( l o/2)/(p t o/2)=c,  which  means  that
the corresponding period in the loop must be (p /2)t o or longer. The nearest period longer to
(p /2)to (=1.57to) allowed by doubling is 2, so the shortest period in this case is 2t o. Numerical
calculations for stable elementary particles are shown in chapter 3.

3.1 The elementary electric charge
The Planck charge qo=4.701.10 18 (As) is surprisingly close to the elementary electric charge
e=1.602.10 19  (As)  differing  only  by  a  factor of  about  29.  Obviously  equality  would  be  the
simplest case,  but  it seems that subcharges  have  been  borne in process of time, as  doubling
(i.e.  halving)  process  has  continued.  We  shall  now  show  that  a  particular  subcharge  is  the
elementary electric charge.
The perceived number of doublings for the elementary charge squared is:

which  means N=39  doublings  in  four  dimensions.  According  to  equation  (20)  a  perceived

where g is 2  3 9 / 4 = 2   ( 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 2 ) / 4, which is a superstable (1, 2, 4, 32) structure.

which is the ratio of the elementary charge and Planck charge squared. We further obtain

Since e 2/q o

2  =  2  3 9 / 4  ,  the  inverse  of  the  fine  structure  constant a   obtains  a  value  of a   1

From Eq. (21) the elementary charge obtains a value of

e = 1.60213.10 19 (As),

(24)

which differs by 30 ppm from the recommended value.
The process of volume doubling may also produce other values for the force constants. Some
of these are shown in reference [5].

3.2 Rest energy and magnetic moment

3.2.1 Electron positron pair
The  superstable N=224  or  (32,  64,  128)  sublevel  1.021  MeV  energy  is  almost  exactly  the
same  as  the  rest  energy  of  an  electron positron  pair.  We  may  therefore  assume  that  under
proper conditions this sublevel may materialize into an electron positron pair, when split into
two equal parts and occupied by elementary electric charges. The total energy of the object is
the sublevel energy added by the corresponding electric field Coulomb energy.
Because  (32, 64, 128) sublevel is superstable, we must assume that the electron positron pair
forms a joint energy object, i.e. they remain connected.
Equations (10), (18)  and (19) show that magnetic moment  is directly proportional to period.
Energy (E=h/t), in turn,  is  inversely proportional  to period. The split energies and  magnetic
moments of the N=224 sublevel then correspond to N=227 period doublings and the perceived
number of doublings is n=75.67 for both the half energies and the magnetic moments.
Tables II and III show the numeric values corresponding to the splitting of the N=224 or (32,
64, 128) sublevel into a pair of particles.
The  model  for  an  electron positron  pair  is  simply  a  Planck  energy  sublevel  occupied  by
elementary electric charges. The differences between the calculated and experimental values
may be compared to the separation of the 3 d sublevels in 2.4.

3.2.2 Electron magnetic moment anomaly
The magnetic moment m  of a particle is traditionally considered as resulting from the charge
e, mass m and spin S (= h/2p ) of the particle:

m

=

g s

e
2
m

S

(25)

(cid:215)
(cid:215)
where eS/2m  is called  magneton  (either  Bohr  or nuclear  depending  on  the  value  of m).  The
dimensionless  number g s  is  gyromagnetic ratio  characteristic  to the  internal  structure of  the
particle.  The  experimental  values  of g s  for  the  electron,  proton  and  neutron  are  –1.001,
+2.793 and –1.913 respectively. The experimental value of the electron magnetic moment is a
little  larger  than  the  Bohr  magneton m B=eS/2m e.  Magnetic  moment  anomaly  is  defined  as
a e(cid:32)(cid:327)m e(cid:327)/ m B  1, where(cid:327)m e(cid:327)is  the  measured electron  magnetic  moment. The anomaly can
be measured very accurately and its current accepted value is ae = 0.00116.
In this  model the magnetic moment anomaly is obtained by replacing the Bohr magneton by
the magnetic moment value given in table III for the electron. One obtains

(26)

which is negative and much smaller than the classical anomaly. The value of ae differs by 160
ppm  from  unity.  This  discrepancy  may  partly  be  due  to  the  inaccuracy  of G  in  the  Planck
mass and hence the model magnetic moment. In principle the doubling process is exact.

3.2.3 Nucleons
The  leptons  and  baryons  differ  from  one  another  in  that  the  leptons  are  considered  as
structureless  particles,  whereas  the  baryons  have  some  kind  of  an  internal  structure.  This
difference is also reflected in the way their rest energies and magnetic moments are borne in
the period doubling scheme.
The electron positron pair is borne by dividing a single 1.021 MeV Planck sublevel (32, 64,
128) into two parts with half energy each. The magnetic moment of the electron is twice the
magnetic moment of the (32, 64, 128) level. The (64, 64, 64) double sublevel with 2 64.Eod =
3749.2  MeV  energy  contains  two  levels  and  the  splitting  yields  correspondingly  a  pair  of
equal energies, which split into four levels (figure 1.) and four magnetic moments, each four
times the (64, 64, 64) magnetic moment.  One fourth of the (64, 64, 64) sublevel energy is the
same as (66, 66, 66) sublevel energy. This is shown in table IV.

The  experimental  rest  energies  of  the
proton  and  neutron  are  938.27  MeV  and
939.57 MeV respectively. Table IV shows
that 937.31 MeV energy is a little short of
the  rest  energies  of  the  nucleons.  If  we
attach a superstable (32, 64,  128) sublevel
structure  and  energy  to  the    937.31  MeV
level,  a  very  close  agreement  between  the
calculated  and  measured  proton 
rest
energies is obtained, as shown by the small

ppm difference.
The measured difference between the rest energies of the neutron and the proton is 1.28 MeV.
Table  IV  shows  that  this  energy  corresponds  to n=74.33  or N=223  single  sublevel  energy,
adjacent to the superstable N=224 sublevel. In this model the elementary electric charges are
introduced in the 937.31 MeV structure by adding an electron positron pair.
The superstable N=192 or (64, 64, 64) radial type  magnetic  moment  is 3.5240.10 27 Am2. If
this value is multiplied by four (corresponding to (66, 66, 66) structure) the magnetic moment
of a proton is obtained, as shown in table V.

m x

According to measurements neutron’s charge is divided into a positively charged inner layer
and a negatively charged outer layer. There are thus two
current  loops  of  opposite  magnetic  moments.  The
negative  loop  has  larger  magnetic  moment  than  the
positive one and the total (negative) magnetic moment is
the sum of the moments of the two loops.
Simplest  case  is  now  assumed:  The  larger  loop  is
identical  to  the  proton’s  loop  (save  the  sign  of  the
charge)  and  a  concentric  smaller  positive  loop m x  is
added, as shown in figure 3.
The measured magnetic moment of the neutron is minus
9.6624.10 27  (Am2).  The  unknown m x  can  now  be
calculated from m x = m p+m n. It is found that

which  shows  that  the  magnitude  of m x results  from  equation  (10),  too.  Neutron’s  magnetic

and  no  traditional  gyromagnetic  ratio  is  needed.  Table  V  shows  the  calculated  magnetic

The 
experimental  magnetic
moment  of  the  proton  differs
from  the  calculated  one  by  720
ppm  and  that  of  the  neutron  by
660 ppm.
A  sublevel  is  just  an  energetic
object  without  any  electrical
charges.  In  the  principle  it  can
be  neutral  or  occupied  by  one
charge  or  two  (opposite)  charges.  In  this  model  the  neutron  is  neutral,  because  it  hosts two
elementary charges forming the magnetic moment current loops but there is only one positive
charge within the proton.
As  hydrogen  is the  most abundant substance  in the universe,  it  is plausible to think that the
negative  charge associated with the proton’s positive elementary charge remains attached to
the proton, although rather loosely. The ground state orbital magnetic moment of hydrogen is
the same as electron’s (intrinsic) magnetic moment. This means that the Bohr orbit magnetic
moment has the same periodic structure as the electron’s magnetic moment.
The special feature with the proton is that the perceived number of doublings, i.e. n=66.00, is
obtained from both a 3 d and a 4 d object ((66, 66, 66) and (66, 66, 66, 66)).

3.3 The Solar system
Equations (11) and (14) yield the model lengths and velocities. Figure 4 shows the distances
and  orbital  velocities  of  the  planets  in  (r,v) space.  The  asteroids  (N=42  in  equation  (14))

occupy the gap between Mars and Jupiter. The observed velocities are consequent values of N
from N=38  (Mercury)  to N=48  (Pluto)  in  equation  (14)  with  one  exception.  There  is  an
unoccupied  orbit  with N=44  between  Jupiter  and  Saturn,  as  if  a  planet  were  missing  there,
too.
The  distances  from  the  Sun  have  been  calculated  from  equation  (11).  The  elementary
interpretation  of  the  quantization  of  velocity  and  distance  is  that  the  periodic  structures
forming  massive bodies synchronize.

3.4 Quantized galaxy redshifts
According to the accepted cosmological model space is expanding. This view is based on the
observed  redshifts  of  the  galaxies,  which  is  the  larger  the  dimmer  (i.e.  farther  away)  the
galaxy  is. This observation  led to the  idea that redshift  is due to the Doppler shift,  meaning
that all galaxies recess from us the faster the farther away they are.
Redshift is composed of three components, one of which is genuine Doppler shift, the others
gravitational  redshift  and  the  third  so  called  cosmological  redshift  due  to  the  expansion  of
“space itself”.
W.G.  Tifft  of  the  University  of  Arizona  has  measured  redshifts  for  over  twenty five  years
using both optical and radio spectra (at 21 cm wavelength). Careful measurements with large
radio telescopes at 21 cm wavelength have given results far exceeding the accuracy of optical
measurements. Tifft has found out with high S/N ratio that the redshifts are not only quantized
but also variable [7].
Quantization  has  been  verified  by  Napier  and  Guthrie  [8]  in  1996  and  Napier  [9]  in  2003.
These observations indicate that the redshift is not due to motion alone.
The most prominent redshift period corresponds to 73 km/s and its half. Practically all Tifft´s
redshift  periods  follow  Eq.  (14)  and  its  modification  (Lehto Tifft  rule),  where  cube  root  is
replaced  by  ninth  root  (allowing  transitions  between  redshift  states).  According  to  the

cosmological  principle  all  observers  anywhere  in  the  universe  should  observe  the  same
redshift periods. The origin of the quantized redshift may not necessarily be velocity at all but
an expression of the energetic state of the galaxy. The doubling process is inevitably function
of time, if the volume of the universe is expanding. This property of the doubling process may
explain the variable redshift periods observed by Tifft.

21 cm wavelength

3.5
According  to  current  understanding  a  neutral  hydrogen  atom  can  experience  an  electron
transition  relative  to  the  proton  spin.  This  magnetic  transition  is  observed  in  many
astronomical  sources  and  occurs  at  21  cm  wavelength.  With N=336,  or superstable  (16,  64,
256), equation (11) yields l =2 1 1 2 . 0 0 .l o e=21.04 cm. The earth laboratory wavelength is 21.12
cm, which corresponds to 1420.4058 MHz frequency.

3.6 Cosmic background temperature
The 3K cosmic background radiation corresponds to a black body, whose temperature is 2.73
K.  Equation  (13)  yields T=2.76  K  with N=320,  or  superstable  (64,  128,  128).  The  next
number  of  volume  doublings  towards  colder  temperature  is N=321,  which  corresponds  to
2.189  K.  It  is  interesting  note  that  this  temperature  is  very  close  to  the l  point  2.186  K  of
liquid helium 4He. This is the temperature, where helium becomes super fluid and its specific
heat rises abruptly. This may be an accidental coincidence, but if it is not, then there might be
a physical explanation. Since superfluidity means frictionlessness (or losslessness), then even
a  weak  coupling  to  oscillating  driving  force  at  resonant  frequency  (i.e.  Planck  sublevel)
creates large amplitudes.

3.7 Cosmic ray spectrum
The most energetic particles are found  in the cosmic rays producing the muon showers. The
energy spectrum of incident particles is shown schematically in figure 5 as function of energy
per nucleus. The  vertical  axis is particle  flux in  an arbitrary  logarithmic  scale. The puzzling
features in the curve are the “knee” at 4.5 PeV and the “ankle” at around 6 EeV, as pointed
out by R. Ehrlich [10].

FIG. 5. The knee and ankle in the cosmic ray spectrum.

Equation (7) yields E = 4.4 PeV with N = 128, which is superstable (32, 32, 64). For N = 96
or  superstable  (32,  32,  32),  we  obtain  7.1  EeV.  These  energies  coincide  with  the  knee  and
ankle energies, as shown in figure 5. The observed kinetic energies correspond to transitions
from N=125 to N=128 sublevel and from N=93 to N=96 sublevels. It may me predicted that
there ought to be another “knee” at N=160 (superstable (32, 64, 64)) corresponding to 2.7.103
GeV energy.
A review article of the present models of the knee and ankle is presented in [11]. None of the
models is based on period doubling.

SUPERSTABILITY

The decimal part of the perceived number of doublings tells the number of dimensions of the
structure or object, because n=N/3 points to three dimensions and n=N/4 to four dimensions.
This information makes it possible to break N down into components in 3  and 4 dimensions.
The objects  in Table VI are related to structures showing  very  high stability over time. The
superstability condition Ni=2i is found with all these objects.

Notation  “(p e)  magnetic  moment”  means  the  sum  of  the  absolute  values  of  the  magnetic
moments of a positron and an electron. The role of the double levels is explained in chapter
3.2.3.
The  number  of  dimensions  of  the  elementary  electric  charge  squared  is  an  interesting
exception. This may mean that electric interactions take place also via the fourth dimension.

FORCE RATIOS

The volume doubling process seems to be applicable to both spatial and temporal structures of
matter. If we assume that the expansion of the universe is connected to the process of volume
doubling then this process should be going on at the present time, too. As no smaller electric
charge  is  known  to  exist  than  the  elementary  electric  charge,  we  must  conclude  that  the
volume doubling process is at halt after 39 volume doublings in four dimensions. This means
that an extremely stable configuration has been reached.
As  comes  to  the  Planck  mass  the  doubling  process  seems  to  have  halted  at  the  electron 
positron pair after N=224 volume doublings, because no lighter elementary particles than the
electron and positron are known to exist.

The Planck mass and charge represent the same energy, because

2/l o=q o

ol o.

This  means  that  in  the  beginning  the  energy  gradients,  or  the  gravitational  force  and  the
electrostatic (Coulomb) force were equal.
Because  the  Planck  charge  has  experienced  much  fewer  volume  doublings  than  the  Planck
mass,  its  strength  is  consequently  much  larger.  Figure  6  shows  how  the  Planck  mass  and
charge squared have developed in process of time as the volume doubling has proceeded.

FIG.  6.  Relative  dilution  of  the  Planck  mass  and  charge  squared  as
function  of  the  perceived  number n  of  volume  doublings  in  process  of
time. Initial  value  is taken as 1.  Note that 2.74.67=149.33 (n of e p pair
mass squared).

Figure 6 shows that the volume doubling process has proceeded much farther with mass than
with  the  electric  charge.  The  difference  between  the  perceived  numbers  of  doublings  is
149.33 9.75=139.58. This means that the perceived ratio of the forces (which are proportional
to  mass  and  charge  squared)  is  2 (1 4 9 . 3 3  9 . 7 5 )  =  10 4 2.  This  ratio  may  be  interpreted  as  the
perceived  order  of  magnitude  ratio  of  the  present  strengths  of  the  electric  and  gravitational
interactions.
The strength of the so called weak interaction is on the order of 10 13. This is close to 2  1 2 8 / 3
= 1.4.10  13, which would relate this interaction to the superstable (32, 32, 64) sublevel.

DISCUSSION

The number today of known elementary particles is huge. In this article only the properties of
the basic ones (i.e. electron, positron and the nucleons) have been investigated. A systematic
analysis  will  be  needed  for  further  studies,  since  there  are  plenty  of  possibilities  to  add  and
subtract energies. The known conservation laws, like conservation of leptons and others, may
help in finding the right schemes and ways to combine energy sublevels.

The period doubling process seems to be applicable to both mass and charge. Table VI shows
that the difference between mass (energy) and charge  is in the number of dimensions, as the
electric charge squared is four dimensional.
The rest energies of the electron and the positron are found in the direct sequence of energy
sublevels obtained by the doubling process from the Planck energy. The nucleons seem to be
composite particles, and their rest energy  is obtained  from a double Planck energy  sublevel.
The  magnetic  moment  structures  are  also  different.  Electron’s  magnetic  moment  is  of  the
Bohr type, whereas nucleon’s magnetic moment is radial.
The  Bohr  magneton  seems  to  be  applicable  to  single level  particles,  because  the  number  of
doublings  (or  halvings)  is  the  same  for  the  (orbital  type)  magnetic  moment  and  the
corresponding  Planck  energy  sublevel.  The  nuclear  magneton  is  not  applicable  to  the
nucleons,  because  the  nucleon  rest  energy  is  determined  by  the  sum  of  two  Planck  energy
sublevels and the magnetic moments by one or two radial type magnetic moments.
Spin  was  invented  to  explain  the  magnetic  moments  of  particles  and  is  traditionally
considered  as  a  fundamental  property  of  particles. In  this  model  it  is  the  magnetic  moment
that is fundamental and spin has no special role and is not needed to explain the basic particle
properties dealt with.
The  analysis  of  the  electron  magnetic  moment  anomaly  in  chapter  3.2.2  showed  that  the
anomaly  is  near  zero  according  to  this  model.  Because  the  doubling  process  is  exact,  there
should be no anomalies.
The superstability condition applies to the electron positron pair, not the electron or positron
alone.  This  is  interesting  in  the  sense  that  it  is  the  electron positron  pair  that  is  stable.  This
implies that the electron and positron always co exist forming a joint energy object and being
somehow connected. The pair can be spatially separated in the 3 dimensional world without
altering  their  invariant  properties.  Freedom  in  the  3 dimensional  space  means  that  the
connection is via the fourth dimension.
The  non removable  connectedness  of  the  electron positron  pair  may  be  related  to  the  EPR
paradox, too.
W.G. Tifft has shown that the redshift period of galaxies may change from one period to the
next  (redder,  i.e.  lower  energy)  period  in  a  few  years.  As  the  thicknesses  and  diameters  of
galaxies  are  typically  10,000 100,000  light  years,  no  signal  traveling  at  the  speed  of  light
would  reach  the  whole  galaxy  within  years.  This  implies  that  the  galaxy  is  some  kind  of  a
superstructure and the change  is due to the doubling process concerning the whole structure
simultaneously.  The  Sun  is  also  a  superstructure  in  a  smaller  scale,  as  shown  by  the
quantization of the Solar system. According to this model the change takes place in the fourth
dimension.
If  the  hydrogen  atom  is  considered  as  an  “elementary  particle”  based  on  its  structure  (as
explained  earlier),  then  there  is  no  need  for  speculations  about  the  existence  of  antimatter
worlds.  The  neutron  hosts  both  an  electron  and  a  positron and  the  hydrogen  atom  does the
same. Of course, the positions of the electron and positron can be artificially exchanged thus
creating antimatter.
There  is  room  in  this  model  for  the  neutrinos.  They  may  be  related  to  the  unoccupied
sublevels and/or the fourth dimension.
Actually, this model does not distinguish between small or large, elementary or sophisticated,
as all structures are obtained using the principle of multidimensional period doubling. In some
sense  the  objects  obtained  are  fractal,  i.e.  their  structures  have  similar  geometric  properties
despite of the number of doublings or their “size”.

ABSTRACT 
 

 

The fully retarded dispersion interaction between an atom and a cluster or between two 

clusters  is  calculated.  Results  obtained  with  two  different  methods  are  compared.  One  is  to 

consider  a  cluster  as  a  collection  of  many  atoms  and  evaluate  the  sum  of  two-body  and  three-

body  interatomic  interactions,  a  common  assumption.  The  other  method,  valid  at  large 

separation, is to consider each cluster as a point particle, characterized by a polarizability tensor, 

and  evaluate  the  inter-cluster  interaction.  This  method  employs  the  static  polarizability, 

evaluated  by  including  all  many-body  (MB)  intra-cluster  atomic  interactions  self-consistently, 

which  yields  the  full  inter-cluster  interaction,  including  all  MB  terms.  A  comparison  of  the 

results  from  the  two  methods  reveals  that  the  contribution  of  the  higher-than-three-body  MB 

interactions  is  always  attractive  and  non-negligible,  with  a  relative  importance  that  varies  with 

geometry.  The  procedure  is  quite  general  and  is  applicable  to  any  shape  or  size  of  dielectric 

clusters,  in  principle.  We  present  numerical  results  for  clusters  composed  of  atoms  with 

polarizability  consistent  with  silica,  for  which  the  higher-than-three-body  MB  correction  term 

can  be  as  high  as  42%  of  the  atomic  pair-wise  sum.  The  full  result  is  quite  sensitive  to  the 

anisotropic structure of the cluster, in contrast to the result found in the additive case, which is 

orientation  independent.  We  also  present  a  power  law  expansion  of  the  total  van  der  Waals 

(VDW) interaction as a series of n-body interaction terms. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

In  many  studies  of  condensed  phases  of  matter,  researchers  have  assumed  that  the 

relevant forces between two macroscopic substances arise from pair-wise dispersion interactions 

between the constituent atoms. (Here, we let the term “atom” refer to any polarizable, small unit 

such as a molecule.) With that assumption, one can easily compute the net force on a specified 

atom  by  summing  force  contributions  from  neighboring  atoms.  Equivalently,  the  net  potential 

energy is considered as a pairwise sum of interactions between atoms. While these assumptions 

simplify  computations,  one  may  wonder  whether  they  are  valid.  Indeed,  in  the  nonretarded 

regime,  it  is  well known  that  many-body  (MB)  corrections  to  additivity  are  important  in  many 

cases,  including  the  cases  of  the  inert  gas  fluids,  where  one  obtains  better  agreement  with 

experimental  data  when  the  three-body  interaction  terms  are  included  [1-5].  Researchers  have 

tended  to  generalize  these  results  to  other  systems  and  adopt  one,  or  other,  of  three  strategies: 

assume  that  MB  corrections  to  additivity  are  negligible,  employ  a  two-body  potential  that 

nominally includes 3-body interactions or evaluate three-body interactions explicitly and assume 

that they represent the only significant correction to the additivity approximation. 

For more than 50 years, it has been realized that the finite velocity of light affects van der 

Waals (VDW) interactions: this phenomenon is called retardation. Effects of retardation appear 

when  separations  between  interacting  bodies  are  larger  than  about  10  nm.  These  are  receiving 

increasing attention for reasons of both fundamental and applied science [6-13]. The evaluation 

of these interactions in the fully retarded regime, of very large separation, is simpler than in the 

nonretarded regime, because one needs to know just the static polarizability in the former case, 

while  latter  requires  the  frequency-dependent  polarizability.  This  fully  retarded  regime  is 

sometimes referred to as the “Casimir force” regime since Casimir and colleagues developed the 

first treatment of such forces [14, 15]. 

Up to now, there has not been any detailed study of MB effects in the VDW interaction 

 

2

between clusters in the fully-retarded regime [16]. An efficient way (exact at large separation) to 

evaluate the interaction is to consider each cluster as a single large molecule with a well-defined 

polarizability  tensor  and  use  the  rigorous  expression  derived  for  the  VDW  interaction  between 

molecules.  There  is  a  body  of  experimental  and  theoretical  information  concerning  the 

polarizability for the case of metallic clusters [17-19]. Unfortunately, since this is not the case for 

dielectric clusters, one needs an alternative way of calculating VDW interactions between such 

clusters.  One  way  to  achieve  this  has  been  to  add  two-body  interactions  between  constituent 

atoms. This traditional way of calculating the VDW interactions between two clusters ignores the 

interactions between atoms comprising a cluster and results in the effective polarizability of the 

cluster as a simple sum of the individual atomic polarizabilities.     

In  our  previous  work  [20],  we  have  evaluated  the  static  polarizability  of  a  cluster  of 

arbitrary  shape  and  size,  using  a  microscopic,  self-consistent  method  which  includes  all  MB 

interactions between atoms in the cluster. It has been shown that this cluster polarizability differs 

from the simple sum of the individual atomic polarizabilities. Using these cluster polarizabilities, 

we can evaluate the VDW interaction between dielectric clusters at large separation, considering 

each  cluster  as  a  single  large  molecule.  Since  this  interaction  includes  implicitly  all  MB 

interactions,  we  obtain  the  full  VDW  interaction,  including  all  MB  terms,  in  the  fully-retarded 

regime.   

  

The  outline  of  this  paper  is  the  following.  In  the  next  section,  we  describe  the  basic 

formulation  and  the  set  of  cluster  configurations  considered.  In  section  III,  we  present  an 

evaluation  of  the  fully  retarded  interaction  between  various  clusters  and  a  single  atom.  This  is 

followed, in section IV, by an evaluation of the interaction between two clusters. In sections III 

and IV, the "full" (exact) results are compared with the “partial” (approximate) results based on 

the  addition  of  the  two-body  and  three-body  interactions.  Our  results  (typically,  inadequacy  of 

the additivity approximation) are summarized and discussed in section V.

II. RETARDED DISPERSION POTENTIAL : FORMULATION 

Here, we calculate the inter-cluster interaction by treating each cluster as a point particle, 

with a  calculated static polarizability [20], and compare  this result with that derived by adding 

two-body interactions between atoms belonging to different clusters. Since a cluster, in general, 

has an anisotropic polarizability, we employ the expression for the two-body retarded dispersion 

interaction between anisotropic particles [21, 22] for the inter-cluster interaction:

.  In  recent  work  [20],  we  evaluated  the  static 

polarizabilities of clusters of various shapes and sizes by utilizing a microscopic, self-consistent, 

linear response method, which is exact within the linear and dipolar approximations. We will use 

4

where 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these  polarizability  values  to  calculate  the  two-body  retarded  dispersion  interaction  between  a 

cluster  and  an  atom  and  also  between  two  clusters.  Since  this  polarizability  includes  all  intra-

cluster MB terms, the resulting interaction includes all MB contributions. 

 

 

For comparison, we evaluate the inter-cluster VDW interaction by considering each 

cluster as a composite of atoms and adding pairwise interatomic interactions. Here, each “atom” 

is characterized with an isotropic atomic polarizability, as described below. We also evaluate the 

leading non-additive correction term by summing the three-body atomic interactions. The three-

body dispersion interaction, here, involves three isotropic atoms A, B and C, where A and B are 

nearby atoms within a cluster (i.e., in nonretarded separation regime) while C is far from those 

two (i.e., in retarded regime), located in the other cluster, as shown in Fig.1. Therefore, there is 

retardation in the interactions A-C and B-C, but not A-B. An analytic formula for such a three-

body interaction is derived following the procedure of Aub and Zienau [22] ; the detailed 

derivation and resulting expression are provided in Appendix I.  As in the Axilrod-Teller-Muto 

(ATM) [23, 24] expression for the non-retarded three-body interaction, this partially retarded 

three-body interaction depends on the inner angles of the triangle connecting the three atoms 

involved, 

Aθ ,  Bθ  and  Cθ . Note that the distance dependence of the "partially retarded" three-

body interaction is 

10−r

, in contrast to the 

9−r dependence of the non-retarded three-body (ATM) 

interaction.  

 

To explore the dependence on the cluster geometry, several shapes, sizes and orientations 

are  investigated:  linear  clusters  (with  dimension 

L××11

)  with 

2=L

  to  1000 ,  square  prism 

clusters (

L×× 22

) with 

2=L

 to  200 , cubic  clusters (

LLL
××

) with 

2=L

 to  10  and square 

monolayer  clusters  (

LL ××1

)  with 

2=L

  to  30 .  Here,  each  cluster  is  composed  of  atoms 

residing at simple cubic lattice sites with lattice constant 

0a , and the lattice constant is the unit of 

length.  For  quantitative  estimates,  we  use  atomic  polarizabilities  and  lattice  constants  of  silica 

[20, 25]. The “atomic” polarizability (

atomα ) is determined from the Clausius-Mossotti relation, 

 

5

using known dielectric spectra of fused silica (

SiO ) [20, 26], and the lattice constant is obtained 

2

from  the  known  number  density  (

These are the ratios of the MB and three-body atomic interaction contributions to the pair-wise 

sum  of  two-body  atomic  interaction,  respectively,  divided  by  the  product 

sn α   [27].  The 

atom

difference between these ratios represents the contribution of many-body interactions of higher 

order than three-body interactions:

(6) 

The subscript  h4  means that fourth and higher order contributions are included. 

Due  to  the  polarizability  anisotropy  of  the  cluster,  the  interaction  depends  on  the 

 

 

6

orientation  of the cluster;  the  results of 

4hR  for various clusters are shown in Figs. 2 to 6 as a 

function of the total number of atoms (N) in each cluster. In Fig. 2, although the magnitude of the 

higher-order many-body contribution (

hR4 ) is a function of both shape and orientation, we find 

that all of these higher order terms represent attractive contributions to the potential. In contrast, 

as  seen  in  Figs.  3  to  6,  the  three-body  contributions  may  be  either  attractive  or  repulsive, 

depending  on  the  orientation  [25,  28].  The  magnitude  of  these  higher-order  contributions  vary 

between  5  %   of  the  two-body  energy  for  isotropic  cubic  clusters  and  42  %   for  anisotropic 

square monolayer clusters. Note that the orientation dependence of 

hR4  remains significant even 

at  such  large  separation  between  an  atom  and  a  cluster  except  for  the  case  between  a  square 

monolayer  cluster  and  an  atom.  The  case  of  a  square  monolayer  is  an  exception  in  that 

hR4  

values for parallel and perpendicular orientations coincide. The notable orientation dependences 

for both linear and square prism clusters are: (i) 

hR4  is nearly 50% larger for parallel orientation 

than  for  perpendicular  orientation,  and  (ii) 

3R   is  positive  when  long  dimensions  are  oriented 

parallel  to  the  inter-cluster  connecting  line  and  is  negative  for  perpendicular  orientations.  The 

orientation  dependence  of  (ii)  is  consistent  with  that  found  in  the  non-retarded  three-body 

interaction [27]. We also note that 

R h >
4

R
3

 for all cases studied. Thus the inclusion of just the 

three-body interactions is a significant underestimates of the many-body interactions. Indeed, in 

some cases the sign of the three-body term (only) is “wrong”, so that the exact result is closer to 

the two-body energy than to the sum of two-body and three-body energies. 

Now, we would like to show that the total atom-cluster interaction can be expanded in a 

power law series in terms of 

sn α  in which each term corresponds to the n-body atomic terms 

atom

in the perturbation expansion, where n=2, 3, 4 … . The details of the derivation are as follows. In 

Ref. [20], in addition to the numerical values of the static polarizability for finite-size clusters, 

analytic expressions for the static cluster polarizability are derived for both infinite-size clusters 

 

7

and ellipsoidal continuum clusters. In comparing results for linear and square monolayer cluster, 

excellent agreement was found between polarizabilities of a large linear cluster and of an infinite 

linear chain, and also between those of a large square monolayer cluster and of a continuum disc. 

Therefore, we employ the analytic expression for the cluster polarizability of the infinite linear 

chain  and  the  continuum  disc  for  finite-size  linear  clusters  and  square  monolayer  clusters, 

respectively,  and  expand  the  analytic  expression  in 

sn α .  For  example,  the  fully  retarded 

atom

interaction  between  an  atom  and  a  linear  cluster  (A)  lying  along  x-axis,  perpendicular  to  the 

connecting line (z-axis) is:

linear clusters. The positive sign indicates an attractive three-body interaction for this orientation, 

consistent  again  with  that  found  for  the  nonretarded  three-body  interaction  [27]. The  results  of 

the expanded VDW interactions between an atom and a linear cluster are shown in Fig. 7. We 

have also expanded the fully retarded vdW interaction, as above, for a square monolayer cluster, 

and  the  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.  The  power  expansion  expressions  of 

mR   for  various 

orientations  are  listed  in  the  Appendix  II.  For  the  square  monolayer  cluster,  the  n-body  terms 

involving odd (even) number of atoms ( n ) are repulsive (attractive), except for the 3-body term 

when the cluster lies along the connecting line. This is an interesting contrast from the results for 

the linear cluster, where all of the n-body terms are attractive, with the exception of the 3-body 

term  when  the  cluster  lies  perpendicular  to  the  connecting  line.  The  results  obtained  from  the 

direct sum of three-body atomic interactions using eq. (17) are also plotted in Figs. 7 and 8, and 

they show quite good agreement with those found in the series expansion convincing us that the 

 

 

 

9

series expansion indeed gives the MB terms.  

For the interaction of an atom with an asymmetric cluster, the total dispersion interaction 

is  always  found  to  be  most  strongly  attractive  when  the  cluster  is  oriented  parallel  to  the  line 

connecting it to the atom. This finding is also true within the approximation including just pair 

and  three-body  interactions.  However,  the results  in  Fig.  2  show  that  the  magnitude  of  higher-

order many-body contribution is not negligible. The most dramatic case is the most symmetrical 

situation,  a  cubic  cluster  depicted  in  Fig.  6. Here,  the  three-body  interaction is  essentially  zero 

while  the  many-body  contribution  is  not  negligible  (although  it  is  smaller  than  for  asymmetric 

clusters).  Here,  note  that  the  vanishing  three-body  interaction  for  symmetric  clusters  has  also 

been  found  in  the  non-retarded  three-body  interaction,  at  large  separation  [27].  Note  that  the 

series expansion of the expression for a continuum sphere, which corresponds the large size limit 

of a cubic cluster, gives all the MB contribution terms as zero. We note that the series expansion 

of the VDW interaction is an asymptotic expression and the accuracy is expected to increase as 

the cluster size increases. 

IV. FULLY RETARDED CLUSTER-CLUSTER INTERACTIONS 

In  this  section,  the  interaction  between  two  clusters  is  also  calculated  in  two  ways.  We 

obtain the interactions V , 

)2(V  , and 

)3(V , the ratios of the many-body ( mR ) and three-body (

3R ) 

interaction  contributions  to  the  pair-wise  sum  of  two-body  interaction,  respectively,  and  the 

difference between these two ratios (

4hR ). One can evaluate  V  for an arbitrary pair of clusters. 

For  interactions  between  two  identical  cubic  clusters,  the  MB  contribution  is  small,  due  to 

symmetry;  since  for

,  the  three-body  contribution  is  negligible  while 

the higher order MB contribution to the two-body contribution is 

%10~

 [see Fig. 9]. 

  For a pair of linear clusters,  V  depends on three angles: the polar angles (θ  and 

'θ ) 

and  the  difference  φ∆   between  their  azimuthal  angles,  where  the  z  axis  lies  along  the  inter-

 

10

cluster  vector.  We  have  considered  four  different  relative  orientations:

, denoted zz, xx, zx, and yx, respectively. For 

interactions  between  two  identical  square  prisms  (or  lines),  the  three-body  contribution  is  the 

most attractive in the zz-configuration and is weakly attractive in the zx-configuration. Figures 

10  and  11  show  instances  when  the  three-body  interaction  is  repulsive,  xx-  and  yx-

configurations.  Therefore, if one were to calculate the interaction by summing the two-body and 

the  three-body  contributions,  the  attraction  would  be  the  strongest  for  zz  and  then  case  zx, 

followed  by  xx  and  yx.  However,  if  one  includes  higher-order  contributions,  the  order  of  the 

strength  of  the  attraction  changes.  From  strongest  to  weakest  attraction,  the  order  becomes  zz, 

xx, zx, and yx. 

Similar  changes  are  also  observed  in  the  interaction  between  two  identical  square 

monolayers. For a pair of square monolayer clusters, due to symmetry,  V also depends on three 

angles  as  for  linear  clusters,  except  here  that  the  polar  angles  and  the  azimuthal  angles  are 

defined by the direction of the surface normal vector pointing vertically outwards on one side of 

the monolayer. We have considered three configurations: 

,'
,(
=∆φθθ

)

)0,0,0(

, 

,2/
(
ππ

)0,2/

, 

and 

,0( π

)0,2/

,  denoted  xx,  zz,  and  xz,    respectively,  named  from  the  direction  of  the  longer 

dimension  of  the  monolayer  (see  Fig.  12).  The  three-body contribution  is  strongly  repulsive  in 

the  xx-configuration,  weakly  repulsive  in  the  xz-configuration,  but  attractive  in  the  zz-

configuration. Hence, if one were to calculate the interaction by summing the two-body and the 

three-body contributions, the attractive strengths would decrease in the sequence zz, xz and xx. 

The order changes to zz, xx and xz,  however, when we include higher-order MB contributions. 

It  is  interesting  to  observe  in  Fig.  12  that  the  magnitude  of  the  higher-than-three-body 

contributions  for  xx  and  zz  are  almost  the  same  and  the  difference  between  the  two  cases  is 

primarily due to the different three-body contribution. 

The  full  VDW  interactions  between  two  clusters  are  expanded  in  a  power  series  of  

 

11

sn α , as done in the previous section. The analytic expressions are listed in the Appendix II 

atom

for different shapes and relative orientations of two clusters. The numerical results are shown in 

Figs. 13 and 14 for silica decamers (N=10) and square monolayer clusters (N=100), respectively. 

For  a  pair  of  decamers, 

)2(V   accounts    for  only  49%  of  total  VDW  interaction  for  zz 

configuration and 64%, 75%, and 84% for xx, zx, and yx configurations, respectively. Similarly, 

for a pair of square monolayers (N=100), 

)2(V  accounts for 49% of total VDW interaction for zz 

configuration and 60% and 69% for xx and xz configurations, respectively. While each MB term 

higher than third order contributes an additional attraction for decamers, these terms for square 

monolayers alternatively change sign depending on the number of atoms involved in the many-

body term (n), being even and odd, respectively. In contrast, the three-body term  can be either 

repulsive or attractive, depending on the relative orientation of the clusters, and the sign agrees 

with that of the nonretarded 3-body energy [25]. The results obtained from the sum of two-body 

and three-body atomic interactions, using eqs. (1) and (17), are also plotted in Figs. 13 and 14, 

and they show good agreement with those found in the series expansion.  

  

V. CONCLUSION 

 

The fully retarded dispersion interaction between various kinds of clusters with an atom 

and  also  with  another  identical  cluster  was  evaluated  utilizing  two  methods.  One  is  exact,  in 

principle,  considering  each  cluster  as  a  single  particle  identified  with  a  constant  polarizability 

tensor (as calculated in Ref. 20 including all the many-body interaction terms) and using this to 

calculate the inter-cluster two-body dispersion interaction. Another is to consider each cluster as 

a  composite  of  many  atoms and  add  two-body and  three-body  atomic  interactions  between  the 

constituent  atoms,  as  often  assumed.  The  comparison  between  the  results  from  these  two 

methods shows that the contribution of higher-than-three-body dispersion interactions is always 

 

12

attractive  and  not  negligible.  Including  these  higher  order  MB  terms  causes  a  change  of  the 

orientation  dependence  of  the  interaction  between  two  nanoclusters,  relative  to  that  expected 

when  just  three-body  terms  are  included  as  nonadditivity  correction.  It  is  also  noted  that  the 

dependence on the orientation of asymmetric clusters remains significant even at the very large 

separation of fully retarded regime of interaction. These results demonstrate that the inclusion of 

the many-body dispersion interactions is important in evaluation of the VDW interactions among 

nanoclusters.  The altered ordering of interaction strengths originates from the strong anisotropy 

of the cluster polarizability. We have also presented the power law expansion of the total VDW 

interaction in a series of n-body terms.

APPENDIX I : Three-body atomic dispersion interaction when only one atom is remotely 

located in fully retarded regime. 

Aub  and  Zienau  [22]  have  derived  a  general  form  of  the  three-body  dispersion 

interaction, which is valid for any separation. The special case of a three-body interaction in our 

system (see Fig. 1) involves three atoms A, B and C, where A and B are nearby, within  a cluster 

(i.e.,  nonretarded  regime)  and  C  is  far  from  those  two  (i.e.,  in  retarded  regime),  located  in  the 

other  cluster.  Therefore,  retardation  affects  the  C-A  and  B-C  interactions,  but  not  the  A-B 

13

 

 

 

One then substitute eqs. (13-15) into eq. (12) and carry out the trace, utilizing the integration, 

interaction. We start with Eqs. (30) and (31) in Ref. [22],

FIGURE 1.  (Color online)  Configuration of three-body atomic interaction formulation. 

FIGURE 2.  (Color online) The relative (to two-body) many-body dispersion interaction of 

higher order than the three-body term between one atom and various clusters: cubic cluster 

(green filled circle), linear cluster(red filled) and square prism (blue open) (triangle and diamond 

for orientations with long dimension either parallel or perpendicular to the connecting line, 

respectively), and square monolayer cluster (cross and open square for orientations with long 

dimension parallel and perpendicular to the connecting line, respectively). Solid and dotted 

curves are drawn to guide eyes for parallel and perpendicular orientations, respectively. 

FIGURE 3.   (Color online) Ratios  mR ,

and a square monolayer cluster:  mR  (red filled square), 

3R  (blue open square) and 

hR4  (black 

cross) for orientation with planar surface parallel to the connecting line (z-configuration), and 

mR  (red filled circle), 

3R  (blue open circle) and 

hR4  (black open diamond) for orientation 

perpendicular to the connecting line (x-configuration). Solid and dotted curves are drawn to 

guide eyes for parallel and perpendicular orientations, respectively.

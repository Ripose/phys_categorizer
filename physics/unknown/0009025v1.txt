Abstract
   As a joint effort in the JLC/NLC research program, we
have developed a new type of damped detuned accelerator
structure  with  optimized  round-shaped  cavities  (RDDS).
This paper discusses some important R&D aspects of the
first structure in this series (RDDS1). The design aspects
covered  are  the  cell  design  with  sub-MHz  precision,
HOM  detuning,  coupling  and  damping  technique  and
wakefield  simulation.  The  fabrication  issues  covered  are
ultra-precision  cell  machining  with  micron  accuracy,
assembly  and  diffusion  bonding 
to
satisfactorily  meet  bookshelf,  straightness  and  cell
rotational  alignment  requirements.  The  measurements
described  are  the  RF  properties  of  single  cavities  and
complete  accelerator  section,  as  well  as  wakefields  from
the  ASSET  tests  at  SLAC.  Finally,  future  improvements
are also discussed.
                 1  INTRODUCTION
    An active collaboration between KEK and SLAC on the
development  of  X-band  accelerating  structures  began
more than 10 years ago. As either joint or parallel efforts,
seven  JLC/NLC  prototypes  Detuned  (DS)  or  Damped
Detuned  Structures  (DDS)  have  been  built  [1]  with
several goals in mind. These include testing of long-range
wakefield  suppression,  studying  high  gradient  limits,
accelerating beams in NLCTA and improving accelerator
efficiency. This last goal has been the main focus behind
the  latest  the  Damped  Detuned  Structure  with  Round-
shaped  cavities  or  RDDS1  (see  Figure.  1).  Like  its
predecessors, it is 1.8 m long and consists of 206 cells. To
improve  the  rf  efficiency,  the  structure  cells  were  made
with a rounded shape compared to the flat disk shape used
in  past  structures.  This  change  increases  the  cell  shunt
impedance  by  14%,  allowing  operation  at  lower  input
power to achieve the same average gradient.

dimension calculation

      Figure1: RDDS1 section installed on a strongback.
 Properly chosen, three arcs in the RDDS design optimized
the shunt impedance, Q value and minimized the ratio of
peak surface to average  accelerating electrical field. Also,
the modified  HOM coupling slots reduced the leakage of
the  fundamental  mode  by  a  factor  of  two.  Compared  to
DDS,  the  overall  improvement  in  shunt  impedance  for
RDDS1 is about 19%.
   A  newly  developed  finite  element  parallel-processing
code  Omega3P  was  used  for  the  design  calculations  [2].
To  verify  its  accuracy,  five  sets  of  test  disks  were
carefully  measured  mechanically  with  a  CMM  machine
and  electrically  with  a  network  analyzer.    Excellent
agreement  was  obtained  between  the  experimental  data
and  extrapolated  quadratic  finite  element  results.  A  final
cell  dimensional  table  was  created  with  a  frequency
accuracy of better than 1 MHz.

2.2 Design of Accelerator Couplers

   The  design  goal  for  the  input  and  output  fundamental
coupler and the high order mode couplers is to provide a
good  match  for  the  rf  signals  travelling  through  each  of
them. Time domain MAFIA and finite-element OmegaT3
codes were used to simulate these structures, and usually
some  cold  test  models  were  fabricated  for  confirmation.

of RDDS1 structure.

 3.2 Microwave QC and Feed forward    
Extensive  single  and  multi-disk  rf  measurements  were
made 
the  fundamental  and  dipole  mode
frequencies  [5].  For  single  disk  QC,  each  disk  was
sandwiched  between 
flat  plates.  Frequencies
deviation of four modes (fundamental zero and π mode, π
mode of first dipole band and zero mode of second dipole
band) were measured as shown in Figure 5. The deviation
of any of the four frequencies is within  0.6 MHz rms.

2.3  Further  effort  to  minimize  the  long-range
transverse wakefield

Space  limitations  prevented  coupling  higher  order
modes  to  the  damping  manifolds  from  the  last  few
cavities.  From  the  ASSET  test  of  an  earlier  structure
(DDS3),  it  was  realised  that  the  pair  of  fundamental
output ports appears to couple to these modes, at least for
one  polarisation.  To  exploit 
in  RDDS1,  four
symmetric  output  ports  were  used  that  were  oriented  in
the ±45ο plane because of space constraints (see Figure 4).
Computer  simulation  and  microwave  measurements
showed that when properly  terminated,  these  last  several
cavities had Q’s as low as 300 [3]. Besides this change in
damping,  the  width  of  the  dipole  mode  distribution  was
widened from 10.1 % to 11.3 % to enhance the effect of
detuning.

                         3 FABRICATION
3.1 Disk Fabrication
   After  being  cut  from  bar-shaped  Class-I  OFC  copper
material, each disk was rough machined to have ~ 40µm
remaining copper for all critical dimensions [4]. The final
diamond turning was performed on an ultra-high-precision
lathe under controlled temperature of 20° ±0.3οC. It was
confirmed  that  the  cell  profile  tolerance  of  ±1µm  was
satisfactorily met. A surface finish of 50nm and a flatness
better than 0.5µm assured success in stack alignment and
diffusion bonding.

   Systematic  errors  in  the  fundamental  frequency  were
compensated  by 
for
subsequent cells. We set the tolerance of 5 degrees in the
integrated phase advance at any point along the structure.
It should be noted that this criterion is equivalent to a 0.1
MHz  systematic  frequency  error.  The  beginning  disks
were  machined  to  the  design  dimensions  and  a  series  of
multi-disk  microwave  measurements  were  made.  Based
on  this  frequency  information,  a  feed-forward  correction
in  "b"  (cavity  radius)  was  applied  to  the  disks  in  later
fabrication in order to correct the integrated phase. Figure

phase  shift  (less  than  3°  finally).  With  this  amount  of
feed-forward correction, the frequency distribution of the
first  dipole  mode  was  changed  from  of  the  design

distribution by less than 1MHz. This will not degrade the
designed decoherence for dipole modes [6].  
3.3 Structure Assembly
   The disks were manually stacked on a stainless steel V-
inclined  at  60°  from  horizontal.  The  disk
block, 
misalignment  was  measured  by  running  two  capacitive
gap  sensors  along  the  V-block.  An  autocollimator  was
used for monitoring the perpendicularly of the disks. The
finished stack was pre-diffusion bonded with 600kg axial
force  in  a  furnace  at  180°C  for  a  day.  The  section  was
then  orientated  vertically  and  fully  diffusion  bonded  at
850°  -  890°C  for  four  hours.  Afterward,  waveguide
components,  cooling  and  vacuum  parts  were  brazed  in  a
hydrogen  furnace.  Final  measurement  showed  that  the
cell-to-cell  misalignment  was  better  than  ±1  µm  and  the
bookshelving was within 50 µrad. There was a gentle bow
of 200µm that was straightened after final assembly on the
strongback.

4 LESSONS LEARNED

   Differential expansion of the endplate supports relative
to outer most copper cells lead to a flaring of the ends of
the  structure  during  bonding.  Likewise,  the  relative
expansion  of  a  stainless-steel  torodial  vacuum  manifold
enlarged a few cells near the center of the structure where
it  was  brazed  on.  Although  much  of  the  flaring  was
removed  by  symmetrically  squeezing  the  ends  of  the
structure,  the  schedule  for  installing  the  structure  in
ASSET did not allow time to attempt to correct the center
cells (a scheme has since been worked out). Even with the
center  fundamental  frequency  errors,  which  are  of  the
order of 12 MHz, it was decided that much could still be
learned from the ASSET measurements.

5 ASSET Measurements

   The structure was installed in ASSET facility in Sector
2 of the SLAC Linac on May 24 and removed on August
4.  [7]  As  in  previous  wakefield  measurements,  positrons
extracted  from  the  South  Damping  Ring  served  as  the
drive  bunch  and  electrons  extracted  from  the  North
Damping  Ring  served  as  the  witness  bunch.  Data  were
taken  between  PEP  II  fills,  which  required  streamlining
the magnet and timing setup procedure.  Parasitic single-
beam  measurements  were  also  made  of  the  manifold
dipole signals versus beam position.
   The  wakefield  results  are  plotted  in  Figure  7.  Overall
there is good agreement between the data and prediction
with  the  frequency  errors,  which  were  estimated  from
bead-pull  measurement  data  of  phase  shift  of 
the
fundamental mode. The wakefield is likely dominated by
a  few  modes  in  the  region  of  the  cell  errors.  This  is
supported  by  the  fact  that  the  wakefield  phase  shows  a
smooth variation relative to a single frequency oscillation
(15.094 GHz).
   Additional  measurements  were  taken  in  a  search  for
higher  dipole  band  contributions  in  the  wakefield  dip
region  where  they  should  be  readily  apparent.  Although

Fnothing  obvious  was  found  in  this  region,  26  GHz
wakefields  are  seen  at  shorter  times  once  the  15.1  GHz
components  are  removed.  This  wakefield  is  likely  from
modes  in  the  third  dipole  band.  Analysis  of  higher  band
contributions is still ongoing.

Figure  7:  ASSET  wakefield  data  (vertical  =  dots,
horizontal = crosses) and prediction with and without
central frequency errors.
For  the  single  beam  studies,  the  manifold  dipole  signals
were  either  measured  with  a  spectrum  analyzer  or  with
dowmmixers  and  digitizers.  In  one  set  of  measurements
the  spectra  from  the  nine  RDDS1  ports  that  had  cable
connections were recorded. Each measurement was made
with the beam roughly centred (based on minimizing the
dipole power), and then offset by 0.5 mm in X and Y. The
shape of the spectrum with the beam offset in X is in fair
agreement with predictions from the same model used to
compute 
the  wakefield.  However,  several  narrow
monopole-like  signals  were  seen  in  the  data  and  are  not
understood.  There  is  a  10%  X-Y  power  coupling  of  the
14.2  to  14.6  GHz  signals  that  may  be  related  to  the  cell
ellipticity observed near the upstream end of the structure.
Finally,  the  high  end  of  the  spectrum  falls  off  smoothly
indicating that the fundamental output ports are damping
the uncoupled modes as planned.
   The wakefield data includes measurements made in both
the horizontal and vertical plane: they agree well in both
amplitude  and  phase.  For  this  test,  the  upstream  vertical
HOM ports, which couple to the horizontal dipole modes,
were blanked off to see if any X-Y differences would be
observed.  The  similarity  of  the  results  suggest  that  the
upstream  ports  have  little  effect  as  expected  since  little
power propagates upstream. Therefore, these ports can be
removed in future designs.

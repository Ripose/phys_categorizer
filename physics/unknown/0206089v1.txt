Abstract 

Dipole wakefields in NLC (Next Linear Collider) structures have been measured with ASSET [1] and well predicted by 
a circuit  model [2]. However, the experimental technique is both time-consuming and expensive.  Here,  we report on 
kick factor and synchronous frequency determination for 1st and higher order dipole bands for TW (Traveling Wave) 
accelerators via a wire measurement technique. This stand-alone technique is relatively inexpensive and may lead to an 
efficient determination of wakefield parameters. The perturbative effect of the wire on the dipole band is pointed out 
and a two-wire scheme with a limited perturbative effect is also discussed.

    In the NLC we plan to accelerate 192 bunches each of 
which  consists  of  the  order  of  1010  particles.  This  bunch 
train  is  accelerated  within  a  single  RF  pulse.  As  the 
bunches  are  highly  energetic,  it  is  clear  that  a  non-
negligible  wakefield  will  be  left  behind  each  accelerated 
bunch.  This wake can at the very least considerably dilute 
the final emittance of the beam or, at worst can give rise 
to a BBU (Beam Break Up) instability [3] causing trailing 
increasing 
bunches 
amplitude.   For this reason,  it is  important to be able to 
predict the transverse wakefields that will be excited in a 
given  accelerating  structure.    The  wakefield  can  be 
decomposed  in  various  multipoles,  and  for  the  structures 
under  consideration  for  the  NLC  the  dipole  wakefield  is 
considered to be the most serious component.  This dipole 
field  can  in  itself  be  decomposed  into  a  band  structure.  
The most serious mode we have found to be located in the 
1st  band,  nonetheless,  as  will  be  shown  in  the  following 
the  3rd  and  6th  bands  have  significant 
sections, 
contributions  to  the  overall  wakefield  for  the  TW 
structures already fabricated at SLAC and KEK [4].     
   A  vigorous  program  of  investigating  SW  (Standing 
Wave)  accelerators  for  the  NLC  is  also  in  progress  at 
SLAC,  motivated  by  significantly  reduced  breakdown 
events  being  observed  at  high  gradients  (~70MV/m) 
compared  to  their  TW  counterparts.      However,  the 
partitioning of the wakefield amongst the dipole bands is 
strikingly different  from that  in TW structures [5].    All 
modes up to the 3rd band have almost equal contributions 
to the wakefields and consequently attention will be paid 
to damping all of these modes. 
    We  have  been  able  to  successfully  predict  these 
wakefields  using  a  spectral  function  [2]  technique  which 
is  able  to  incorporate  the  essential  physics  of  the

accelerating  structures  and  to  include  any  experimental 
errors  into  the  simulation.      We  have  compared  these 
theoretical  predictions  with  experiments  to  measure  the 
wakefield using the ASSET facility at the SLC (Stanford 
Linear Collider).  ASSET consists of a sector incorporated 
into part of the SLC to measure the transverse deflection 
on  an  electron  bunch  caused  by  a  positron  drive  bunch 
and  from  this  the  wakefield  is  derived.    However,  this 
experiment  is  both  time  consuming  and  it  requires 
dedicated  beam  time  to  be  allocated  from  a  national 
laboratory’s program.  
    Thus,  a  stand-alone  bench  measurement  of 
the 
wakefield  is  clearly  highly  desirable  from  the  standpoint 
of  being  able  to  routinely  measure  the  wakefield  in  a 
series of structures and in order to make this measurement 
in a relatively inexpensive manner.   A wire measurement 
method to simulate the wakefield left behind a particle by 
the  progress  of  an  RF  pulse  on  a  wire  is  already  in  the 
process  of  being  set  up  at  SLAC  [6].    In  this  paper,  we 
discuss  the  band  structure  likely  to  be  encountered  in  a 
typical cell from an accelerating structure and on coupling 
these  modes  to  the  wire.    We  also  point  out  the  possible 
advantages of a two-wire method.  From this information 
we  intend  to  develop  a  circuit  model  to  describe  the 
couplings  to  a  multi-cell  accelerating  structure  and  this 
will be the subject of a future publication.  

2. BAND STRUCTURE AND COUPLING 
IN WIRE MEASUREMENT  
    The  first  experiment  at  SLAC  that  we  intend  to  do 
using  the  wire  measurement  technique  will  be  on  DS2 
(Detuned Structure number 2), which has been fabricated 
several years ago and is readily available for testing.  We 
will conduct this experiment on the last 50 cells of the 206 
cell  structure.    In  order  to  understand  the  mode  coupling 
to the wire we chose to model cell 198, which is the last 
non-special  cell  [7]  of  the  structure.    We  used  the  finite 
eigenmode  solver  in  the  commercially  available  code, 
HFSS (High Frequency Structure Simulator), to model the 
dispersion characteristics of three separate cases: a single 
cell  loaded  with  no  wire  at  all,  a  single  wire  loading  the 
structure  at  various  offsets  from  the  electrical  centre  and 
two wires symmetrically displaced from the center of the 
cavity.    To  verify  these  results  we  have  used  the  finite 
difference electromagnetics code GdfidL [8] 

    The effect of loading the structure with a single wire 
can  be  found  by  comparison  of  Figs.  1a  and  1b  which 
shows, as one would  expect, that  a fine  wire  in  the  cell

Figure  1  Dispersion  diagrams  for  cell  198  of  DS2  with  periodic  boundary  conditions.  The  cavity  walls  are  perfect 
conductors: a) no wire is present; a quarter of cell is simulated with both symmetry planes having magnetic boundary 
conditions combined with one having magnetic and the other electric boundary; b) a wire with diameter of 250 µm is 
stretched  in  the  center  of  the  cavity;  half  of  a  cell  is  simulated,  with  magnetic  boundary  conditions  in  the  symmetry 
plane;  c)  a  half  cell  as  in  b)  with  the  wire  displaced  by  1  mm  along  the  symmetry  plane;  d)  two  wires  250  µm  in 
diameter  are  placed  symmetrically  around  the  cavity  axis  2  mm  apart;  a  quarter  of  a  cell  is  simulated,  with  the  wire 
placed  in  one  symmetry  plane  having  magnetic  boundary  conditions,  while  the  other  plane  has  an  electric  boundary.

center has little effect on the  dipole mode and almost no 
effect  on  higher  order  multipoles.    While  it  does  add  a 
TEM-coax-like  mode  to  the  spectrum,  there  is  a  very 
strong  coupling  between  that  mode  and  all  the  TM 
monopole  modes.   The light  line indicated on all curves, 
corresponds to a mode propagating in free-space and also 
a  mode  with  a  phase  velocity  of  a  pure  coaxial  TEM 
mode.    Every frequency at which the light line crosses a 
TM  monopole  shows  a  very  strong  avoided  crossing 
effect  with  the  putative  coax  mode.    The  effect  is  so 
strong  that  the  light-line  character  of  the  coax  is  only 
occasionally discernable.   
   It is helpful to next consider Fig. 1d, which consists of 
two wires, each of which are displaced 1mm from the axis 
of  the  cavity.    While  the  wire  pair  has  two  TEM-like 
modes,  presumably  one  would  drive  only  the  twinax 
mode,  a  mode  which  couples  only  to  the  odd  multipoles 
and whose light-line character is evidently well preserved.  
The  avoided  crossing  effect  is  discernable  wherever  the 
light-line  crosses  an  odd  multipole.  The  coupling  is 
strongest for the first, third, and sixth dipoles, but weaker 
for the second and higher order multipole bands.  We note 
however,  that  in  the  initial  experiment  that  will  be 
performed  at  SLAC  only  a  single  wire  will  be  used 
although  driving  the  twinax  modes  may  be  an  option  at 
some  later  stage.    Thus  qualitatively,  at  least,  it  follows 
the behavior of the  kick  factors, and apart from practical 
problems  twinax  excitation  shows  high  promise  as  a 
transverse  wake  simulator.    Fig.  1c  shows  the  effect  of 
displacing  a  single  wire  off  center,  which  would 
presumably  be  more  practical  than  the  twinax  method.  
While  this  procedure  mixes  all  the  multipoles  to  some 
extent, the strongest avoided crossing-like effects involve 
the  crossing  of  the  dipoles  with  the  coax-monopole 
hybrids, crossings which, can be quite remote from light-
line  crossings.    These  plots  provide  an  initial  orientation 
for 
forthcoming 
experimental studies.

3. TRANSVERSE KICK FACTOR AND 
WAKEFIELD ANALYSIS 
   The transverse wakefield excited by a particle beam can 
be  decomposed 
the  beam 
transversely  to  the  axis  of  acceleration.    Here,  we  use  a 
quasi-coupled  analysis 
the

wakefield  at 
individual cell kick factor. The envelope of the wakefield 
is written as the absolute value of a summation:

We  also  evaluated  the  kick  factor  for  5  further  bands 
and  several  further  cells.    These  are  displayed  in  Fig  3 
together  with  the  wakefield  that  results  from  each, 
undamped,  individual  band  for  the  complete  206  cell 
structure.    The  first  band  clearly  is  the  most  serious.  
However,  the  beam  dynamics  simulations  have  indicated 
that  BBU  is  likely  to  occur  for  wakefields  greater  than 
1V/pC/mm/m  and  for  both  the  3rd  and  6th  bands  this  is 
seen to be the case.

Small  perturbations  of 
the  Schrodinger  equation. 
Microscopically, the perturbation of turbulence corresponds to formation of small 
amplitude  helices  on  straight  vortex  filaments.  A  helix  behaves  in  the  vorticity 
field of the fluid as a spin particle in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Taking into 
account elastic properties of the filament leads to the Klein-Gordon equation. 

Keywords: turbulence, vortex filament, quantum mechanics, Schrodinger equation, elastic string,

Introduction 

Schrodinger equation was conceived by the author as describing some deterministic wave similar to 
the wave in a medium. The nonlinear Schrodinger equation is now suggested as a rather universal 
model  of  turbulence  (see  e.g.  [1,  2]).  So,  we  may  conclude  that  small  perturbations  of  ideal 
turbulence provide us with continuum mechanics realization of Schrodinger mechanics.  
  The  intrinsic  feature  of  this  mechanism  is  given  by  dynamics  of  a  vortex  filament  that  is 
recognized as a constitutive element of turbulence [3]. Below we will try to derive the equation of 
motion of a turbulent medium, assuming that its structure element is a straight vortex filament. We 
will take a string as a generalized model of a vortex filament. A string evolves in time by certain 
laws.  We  will  consider  a  string  that  only  slightly  deviates  from  the  rectilinear  configuration. 
Assuming that adjacent parts of the string interact with each other as two vortices we will show that 
the its evolution obeys the Schrodinger equation. In this event, the string takes the configuration of a 
small amplitude helix. Supposing additionally that the string can be stretched elastically we come to 
the Klein-Gordon equation. We will show also that the helices behave in the vorticity field of the 
fluid just as spin particles in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

A vortex filament 

A vortex generates in the fluid a circular velocity field. So, two vortices will rotate each other. The 
same is true for two vortices that are two different parts of one and the same vortex filament. This is 
just  the  cause  why  a  curved  vortex  filament  evolves.  Assuming  that  only  adjacent  parts  of  the 
filament influence each other we come to the following equation

is the torsion of the helix. 
 
It  can  be  shown  [6]  that  large  deviations  of  the  string  from  the  straight  line  obey  a  nonlinear 
Schrodinger  equation.  The  latter  describes  a  soliton  on  the  vortex  filament  that  has  the  form  of  a 
loop. A curvilinear configuration of a nonstretchable filament can be obtained only by adding to the 
straight  vortex  filament  a  filament's  segment.  In  the  case  under  consideration  the  length  of  the 
additional segment equals to

Alternatively the soliton can be seen as a wave packet comprised of the helices described by Eqs. 
(11) and (12) (for details see [5]). 
  The nonlinear analysis shows that the helix on the vortex filament should be properly described 
by the equation

that is simply a time derivative of Eq. (16): 

So, the wave function has the meaning of the velocity which the helix rotates around the screw axis. 

An elastic vortex filament

The elastic stretching of the vortex filament causing a move in the direction of  y  and 
also taken into account. In order to describe this we combine Eqs. (4) and (16) into a single equation.

particular  solution  to  Eq.  (22).  The  left-hand  part  of  Eq.  (4),  or  (22)  has  the  meaning  of  the 
acceleration. In order to find an addition to the acceleration due to self-induction of a vortex filament 
we take twice the derivative of (17) in respect to time. That gives

We may distinguish two kinds of helices that differ in the sign of the torsion (18). The right-hand 
screw helix (Fig.2, right) is described by Eq. (17) with τ > . The left-hand screw helix (Fig.2, left) 
is described by (17) with τ < . As we can see readily from Fig.1, both kinds of helices rotate in the 
same direction, the moment of the helix rotation being directed counter to the vorticity vector of the 
 axis).

  Let us compose from the helices of one sign of the torsion  τ  a wave packet such as it is done 
with harmonic waves in quantum mechanics. The resulting composition will move along the vortex 
filament with the group velocity 
 
 (25) 
Eq. (25) says that the right-hand screw helix travels in the direction that the filament's vorticity points 
to. The left-hand screw helix goes in the opposite direction. In order that these two kinds of helices 
move in one and the same direction they should be resided on antiparallel vortex filaments (Fig.3). 
Then these two helices will have opposite rotational moments  µ .

  Let us impose on this system a fluid vorticity field

the  fluid.  A  helix  will  interact  with  the  vorticity  field  by  the  common  formula  for  the  energy  of

If the field is inhomogeneous the force will act upon a helix. Let we have an ideal fluid pierced in all 
directions by straight vortex filaments. Let two kinds of helices move in the direction of the  x  axis. 
Let a fluid vorticity field exists that grows in the direction of the  y  axis. In order to diminish the 
energy (26) of interaction with the vorticity field a rotational moment  µ  must be oriented along the 
vector 
. A helix can be turned around by its torsion axe if only it will jump over to another 
filament. This must be an adjacent filament with similar but slightly different orientation.

Conclusion 

 

6 

Thus,  we  find  an  elementary  mechanical  object  that  obeys  the  main  equations  of  quantum 
mechanics.  This  object  is  a  vortex  filament  and  it  is  essentially  one-dimensional.  To  extend  this 
dynamics to three dimensions is a nontrivial task and it can not be done analytically. For, here we 
deal  with  the  system  of  infinite  degrees  of  freedom.  However,  the  three-dimensional  Schrodinger 
equation is now widely used in order to describe ideal turbulence [2]. Its validity is confirmed both 
by numerical calculations and experimentally. On the other side, that the system perceived on a large 
scale as a turbulent fluid has the vortical microscopic structure is also nowadays widely recognized. 
This enables us to draw the following conclusion. 
  An ideal fluid pierced in all directions by straight vortex filaments represents a substratum for 
deterministic Schrodinger field. The vortical structure with elastically stretchable filaments supports 
as well the Klein-Gordon field. 

P.S. 

Quantum mechanics demystified 

There are two features that should be added to the model in order to get quantum mechanics. They 
are  the  wave  function  collapse  and  stochasticity.  The  latter  is  inherent  in  the  very  notion  of 
turbulence.  The instantaneity of the collapse of the wave function is ensured by that the ideal fluid is 
incompressible.  

 We see the substratum as a vortex sponge.  In the infinity it may be a tangle rolled from a single 

vortex tube. On a moderate scale it is seen as a fluid pierced by straight vortex tubes, or filaments. 
  A particle corresponds to an additional segment of the vortex tube. Thanks to this addition the 
tube deviates from the rectilinear configuration.  By hydrodynamic relations for the energy [5] the 
loop on the vortex filament thus formed tends to have a specific size. In general, a particle is seen as 
some nonlinear vortex configuration formed on the linear vortex sponge substratum. 
In the stochastic environs the loop is thermalized splitting into small helices that evolve over the 
 
filaments according to Schrodinger equation. This looks as a kind of diffusion and proceeds with a 
finite velocity. Mathematically, the dispersing of a soliton into asymptotic helices corresponds to the 
Fourier  decomposition  of  a  function  into  the  sum  of  harmonics.  In  order  that  the  model  will  be 
consistent in the definition of particle’s mass, the concept of elementary helix should be introduced. 
So  that  in  the  definition  of  the  Planck  constant  (28), 
  must  be  understood  as  the  length  of  an 
elementary helix [5]:

(30) 

Next, let a drop of the pressure occurs at some point of the fluid. This models the measurement of the 
particle.  The  drop  of  the  pressure  destroys  the  dispersion  cloud  causing  the  gathering  of  the 
redundant emptiness into the point. The process runs as a shock wave and in the form of avalanche. 
The speed of the longitudinal wave in the vortex sponge formed in an incompressible medium can be 
infinitely high. The occurence of the two distinct time scales for the processes in a stirred up fluid can 
be clearly observed in experiments [8]. There are two kinds of waves spreading over vortex tube: the 
slow spiral wave and very fast varicose (area-varying) wave. 
 
So, hidden parameters of quantum mechanics may be a turbulent  ideal fluid with the inclusion of 
some  empty  space  and  having  the  vortex  sponge  microscopic  structure.  The  “philosophical”  ban 
imposed on hidden parameters by some influential politicians led to that quantum mechanics was 
mystified. Most popular mystifications are the so called  quantum logic, diffusion with an imaginary 
diffusion coefficient and evolution in imaginary time. 
  The  question  of  supposedly  a  violation  of  the  logic  in  many-slit  one-particle  diffraction  is 
resolved in the aether model by that we see a particle as an inclusion of  empty space into a medium. 
Initially it may be a single cavity. Then it is dispersed in the medium. And after the hit into the screen 

it is again collected into a bubble. The spreading of the emptiness over the medium proceeds with a 
finite velocity. Its gathering into a localized cavity happens instantaneously. 

Concerning the speculations about imaginary time and diffusion coefficient, in order to expose 
them we must return to the law (6) of the motion of a vortex filament. Let us compare it with the law 
of motion of an elastic string. Firstly, take notice that Eq. (6) defines the dependence of the velocity 
of the filament on its configuration. That is why we have the first derivative with respect to time in 
the left-hand part of the Schrodinger equation (16). Whereas the law of motion of an elastic string 
expresses the dependence of the acceleration on the configuration of the filament. So, we have the 
second derivative with respect to time in the left-hand part of the d’Alembert equation (22). 

The linear Schrodinger equation is concerned with an asymptotic solution of Eq. (6) that is a helix 
with  the  amplitude  small  comparing  with  the  pitch  as  it  is  shown  in  relation  (14).  In  this 
configuration the filament’s vorticity is actually parallel to the direction of the

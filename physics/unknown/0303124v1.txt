Abstract 
The dynamics of Saturn’s F Ring have been a matter of curiosity ever since Voyagers 1 and 2 sent back 
pictures of the ring’s unusual features. Some of these images showed three distinct ringlets with the outer 
two displaying a kinked and braided appearance.  Many models have been proposed to explain the braiding 
seen in these images; most of these invoke perturbations caused by the shepherding moons or km sized 
moonlets imbedded in the ring and are purely gravitational in nature. These models also assume that the 
plasma densities and charges on the grains are small enough that electromagnetic forces can be ignored. 
However, Saturn's magnetic field exerts a significant perturbative force on even weakly charged micron and 
sub-micron sized grains causing the grains to travel in epicyclic orbits about a guiding center. This study 
examines the effect of Saturn's magnetic field on the dynamics of micron-sized grains along with 
gravitational interactions between the F Ring's shepherding moons, Prometheus and Pandora.  Due to 
differences in the charge-to-mass ratios of the various sized grains, a phase difference between different size 
populations is observed in the wavy orbits imposed by passage of the shepherding moons. 
 

 
 
1. Background 

Saturn’s F Ring is one of the most dynamic rings observed in the solar system. While Voyager 1 
images showed three distinct ringlets with the outer two displaying a kinked and braided appearance [1], 
Voyager 2 images showed a much more regular structure with four separate, non-intersecting strands [2]. 
Both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 detected brighter clumps within the rings with a temporal dependence 
ranging from days to months [3].  
 
Ring consisted of a core of centimeter to millimeter sized particles ~1 km in width, with an envelope of 
micron and submicron sized grains extending inward ~50 km [4]. Data collected from the Hubble Space 
Telescope in 1995 showed similar features, but resulting fits to the data indicated that the minimum grain 
size is likely to fall within the range of 0.5 to 1 µm, with a maximum of 28% of the ring material being 
submicron in size [5]. 

Photometric data collected by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 suggested that the general structure of the F 

The F Ring lies within the inner part of Saturn's magnetosphere, which contains plasma that rigidly 

corotates with the planet [6].  Thus the dust in Saturn's F Ring can become charged.  Since the plasma 
parameters in the vicinity of the F Ring are poorly constrained, the magnitude of the charge on the dust 
grains is not well known.  Estimations of the grain charge for micron and submicron grains within the F Ring 
have ranged from less than one electron [7] to –38 V [8].  The grain charge is of interest since charged 
grains' orbits will be perturbed by the planetary magnetic field with the magnitude of this perturbation 
depending primarily on the grain's charge-to-mass ratio.  Recently it has been shown that significant 
perturbations are possible for even weakly charged grains.   This allowed the observed physical 
characteristics of the F Ring, such as the 50 km width of the F Ring envelope, to be used to determine that 
the micron and submicron grains within the envelope are likely weakly negatively charged, with a maximum 
|q/m| = 0.03 C/kg [9].  
 
the F Ring's shepherding moons, Prometheus and Pandora, and compare their orbits to that of uncharged 
grains.  Complications not addressed in this study are the inclination of the F Ring and satellite orbits, 
collisional damping between ring particles, collective effects of the charged grains and plasma, and the effect 
of moonlets imbedded within the ring. 
 
2. The box_tree algorithm 

The purpose of this study is to examine the interaction of such weakly charged individual grains with 

The numerical code employed in this study is a modified version of box_tree, a self-consistent N-

body code developed to study Saturn's rings, planetesimal dynamics, and fractal aggregation [10,11,12]. The 
current version has been modified to consider charged grains and the electrostatic and magnetic forces acting 
on them as well as external gravitational potentials such as those produced by shepherding satellites [13]. 
The code has already been used to model a variety of astrophysical and laboratory dusty plasma 
environments, including formation of and wave dispersion in dust crystals [14,15], chondrule formation [16], 
and coagulation in protoplanetary disks [13]. 

The box code [17] divides the ring into self-similar patches or boxes orbiting the planet where the 

box size is much greater than the mean radial excursions of the constituent particles. This allows the boxes to 
be dynamically independent with more distant regions of the ring represented by copies of the simulated 
region. In a rotating system, particle motions are referenced to the center of a box that orbits the planet at the 
local Keplerian velocity. The box code, in providing the external potentials acting on the grains, specifies a 
coordinate system, the linearized equations of motion, and a prescription for handling boundary conditions. 
The tree code [18] provides a mechanism for the rapid calculation of the interparticle forces by means of a 
multipole expansion, reducing the CPU scaling time from O(N2) to O(NlogN) for sufficiently large N. The 
interparticle forces can then be included as a perturbation to the equations of motion.

2.2 Shepherding Satellites and Eccentric Orbits 

The orbits of the F Ring, Prometheus, and Pandora all have small eccentricities [5,19].  While the 

orbits of the shepherding moons can be modeled accurately by box_tree as external gravitational potentials, 

the box containing the ring particles is at a fixed radial distance and thus models a circular orbit.  To include 
the effect of the F Ring's eccentricity, the procedure of Showalter and Burns [7] is followed and the 
combined eccentricity of the rings and satellite is mapped back to the satellite alone.  An "eccentric 
displacement vector" E is defined with polar coordinates (ae, ω) where a is the maximum radial 
displacement out-of-round for a given body, e is the eccentricity, and ω is the longitude of the pericenter.  
Any ring/satellite configuration can thus be described by a0, a1, E0, and E1, where the subscripts zero and one 
refer to the ring and satellite, respectively.  The effect of the satellite on the ring depends on E1 – E0.  By 
choosing to set E0' = 0 and E1' = E1 – E0, all of the eccentricity can be assigned to the satellite.  The effect of 
the "primed" satellite on a circular ring is essentially the same as that of the unprimed scenario, in which 
both the satellite and the ring have eccentric orbits.  The reference longitude for the satellite's eccentricity is 
set at run time, so that the position of the satellite can be varied from closest approach to furthest approach as 
it passes the center of the box. 

 

2.3 Boundary Conditions 

The box_tree code makes use of periodic boundary conditions.  In the general case, ghost boxes 

The shepherding satellites have different mean motions about the planet than does the box.  Particles 

surround the central box and particles that are near a boundary interact with ghost particles in the 
neighboring box.  As a particle leaves the central box, it is replaced by its ghost particle entering from the 
opposite side, keeping the total number of particles in the simulation constant.   These boundary conditions 
were modified slightly to take advantage of special properties of the F Ring.  Since the F Ring is a very 
narrow ring, the box size is chosen to be much greater than the radial width and vertical thickness of the ring.  
Thus particles are only able to leave the box in the azimuthal direction, requiring only two ghost boxes.  
Because the box is a non-inertial, rotating frame, particles that are displaced inward toward Saturn (-x 
direction) have a positive azimuthal drift (in the +y direction) while particles displaced outward (+x 
direction) have a negative azimuthal drift.   
 
that are displaced inward (traveling faster than the mean motion of the box) will spend more time in the 
vicinity of Prometheus, the inner shepherding satellite.  Likewise slower particles will spend more time in 
the vicinity of Pandora, the outer satellite.  This effect was modeled by tracking the number of azimuthal 
boundary crossings, n, for each particle. The number of boundary crossings times the length of the box, nL, 
is added to the azimuthal position of the grain, and this adjusted position is used in calculating the grain-
satellite separation and the gravitational force due to the satellite. The grain's unadjusted position within the 
box is used in calculating the effect of the magnetic field, which is azimuthally symmetric (Connerney 
1993). 
 
3. Results 

For each run, the orbits of 5000 grains were tracked within a 2800 km box, which corresponds to 0.02 

radians of arc at the distance of the F Ring. The grain radii followed a power law size distribution with q = 
3.5 with minimum grain radius amin = 0.5 µm and maximum grain radius amax = 10.0 µm [5]. Grains were 
initially established within the 50 km F Ring envelope without perturbations from shepherding moons.  
Charged grains follow epicyclic orbits about a guiding center while uncharged grains have local Keplerian 
orbits.  The plasma parameters in the F Ring are not well constrained, with estimates of plasma temperature 
ranging from 10 eV < kTe < 100 eV [6] and plasma density ranging from 10 cm-3 < no < 100 cm-3 [21].  For 
this study, the plasma temperature and density were assumed to be constant across the width of the box.  
Using the values kTe = 20 eV, no = 100 cm-3, and dust density Nd = 30 cm-3 [21], calculated grain charges 
yield q/m = -0.03 C/kg for amin and q/m = -3.8×10-6 C/kg for amax [23].  It should be noted that grain charges 
vary only slightly for kTe < 25 eV and as a result the relative dust to plasma density ratio has a relatively 
small effect on the qualitative results of this study [9].   
 
Pandora alone passing the ring section, and Prometheus and Pandora passing the ring section simultaneously.   
The simulation was run using three consecutive boxes for each of the three cases with the data for the three 

Three types of ring/satellite interactions were modeled: Prometheus alone passing the ring section, 

concatenated to display a ring section that subtends 0.06 radians.  The adjusted azimuthal positions were then 
plotted for grains that traveled faster than the mean motion of the box.  

The initial ring configurations before and after passage of the moon(s) are shown in Figure 1 for both 

charged and uncharged grains.  In all three cases with uncharged grains, the passing moon(s) excited an 
rippling orbit as shown in previous models (e.g. [4]) with the grains, across the entire size range, remaining 
in phase.  However, in the case of the charged grains, a distinct phase difference evolves across different size 
populations with the larger charged grains (a ≥ 3.0 µm) having very similar orbits to the larger uncharged 
grains.  Smaller grains (a < 1.0 µm), on epicyclic orbits displaced inward from the F Ring core, have 
increased orbital velocities and therefore are more strongly affected by Prometheus, the inner moon, and less 
strongly affected by Pandora, the outer moon.  As a result, the orbital behavior of the charged and uncharged 
submicron grains differs considerably. 
 
4. Conclusions 
It has been shown that the presence of even very weakly charged grains within Saturn's F Ring can 
 
have a significant effect on the subsequent orbital behavior of the ring particles.  Even when the grains are 
not charged strongly enough to display gravitoelectrodynamic resonances with the shepherding moons, the 
differing charge-to-mass ratios over the various size grains will lead to phase differences in the rippling 
orbits imposed on the ring particles by the passing moons.  This effect may in turn contribute to the observed 
braiding in the F Ring.   
 
gravitational fields of the shepherding satellites.  It is presently computationally infeasible to model both the 
large-scale structure of the F Ring as well as a realistic number density; such a model would require on the 
order of 1016 particles. Accordingly, the dust number density modeled in this system does not correspond to 
the actual dust number density for the F Ring and as such particle interactions and collective effects of the 
charged dust grains and the plasma were ignored. However, since the primary goal of this work was to 
examine the perturbation to individual grain orbits due to their interaction with Saturn's magnetic field, a 
realistic number density was used in calculating the grain charges.   

This model investigated only the effect of Saturn's gravitational and magnetic fields along with the 

While the dust density used in this model is too low to model the collective effects of the charged 

dust grains and the plasma, it is very interesting to note that distinct dusty plasma clouds repel each other due 
to interaction of the plasma sheaths at the boundaries (Morfill, personal communication 2002).  If the phase 
differences created by the shepherding moons truly separate the dust into different populations according to 
size, it is possible that these populations would resist recombination, helping to preserve distinct ringlets.  
The arrival of Cassini in 2004 will provide an opportunity to investigate the structure of the F Ring and its 
plasma environment in detail.  It would be instructive to learn if separate strands have differing size 
populations, or if there is a size gradient across the width of the F Ring envelope. Such size sorting would 
confirm the presence of charged grains within the F Ring and underscore the importance of including even 
very weak charge effects in modeling ring structures.

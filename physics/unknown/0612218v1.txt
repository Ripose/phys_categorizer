We  present  a  scheme  for  remotely  addressing  single  nano-objects  by  means  of  near-field 

optical  microscopy  that  makes  only  use  of  one  of  the  most  fundamental  properties  of 

electromagnetic  radiation:  its  polarization.  A  medium  containing  optically  active  nano-

objects  is  covered  with  a  thin  metallic  film  presenting  sub-wavelength  holes.  When  the 

optical  tip  is  positioned  some  distance  away  from  a  hole,  surface  plasmons  in  the  metal 

coating are generated which, by turning the polarization plane of the excitation light, transfer 

the excitation  towards a chosen hole and induce emission from the underlying nano-objects. 

The  method,  easily  applicable  to  other  systems,  is  demonstrated  for  single  quantum  dots 

(QDs) at low temperature. It may become a valuable tool for future optical applications in the 

nanoworld.

Ultimate  control  of  light  requires  the  combined  ability  of  confining  photons  to  extremely 

small dimensions, i.e. much smaller than their wavelength, and manipulating them in a well-

controlled  state  to  address  at  will  optically  active  single  nanometer-scaled  objects,  such  as 

single  molecules,  semiconductor  QDs  or  nanocrystals.  Routes  in  this  direction  have  been 

opened  up  by  Near-field  Scanning  Optical  Microscopy  (NSOM)  [1]  :  for  instance,  early 

single  molecule  detection  [2]  with  NSOM  using  conventional  optical  tips  has  recently 

evolved  to  NSOM  imaging  with  a  single  molecule  serving  as  a  point-like  light  source  [3]. 

Another  example  is  the  quantum  corral  [4],  an  elegant  realization  of  Scanning-Tunneling 

Microscopy, which has been extended recently to the optics world by NSOM [5]. Here, we 

present a simple optical method aimed at remotely addressing single nano-objects by means 

of  NSOM.  Our  method  does  not  need  sub-wavelength  waveguides  as  a  prerequisite  [6].  In 

essence, it makes only use of one of the most fundamental properties of an electromagnetic 

field with respect to a scalar field: its polarization state, which is controlled at the apex of a 

NSOM  tip  [7].  We  demonstrate  our  approach  on  semiconductor  QDs  at  low  temperature; 

however,  there is  no  restriction  whatsoever to  apply  it to  a large  variety  of  optically  active 

nano-objects under various conditions, in particular under ambient conditions.  

The principle of the method is sketched in fig. 1. A thin opaque metal film,  hollowed 

by sub-wavelength apertures, is deposited onto a medium containing  optically active nano-

objects. A NSOM tip, i.e. a tapered and metal coated optical fiber with an optical aperture of 

typically  100  nm  at  the  tip  apex  [8],  is  coupled  to  a  laser  source  and  is  approached  to  the 

surface with 3D control of its position with an accuracy of 10 nm or better, as is commonly 

done in nowadays NSOM [9]. This allows light to be transmitted through the tip directly to a 

selected nanohole or to a well-controlled position on the metal film. The latter possibility is 

particularly  promising  since  orienting  the  light  polarization  at  the  apex  of  the  optical  tip 

towards  a  particular  hole  allows  to  selectively  launch  surface  plasmons    –  2D  collective 

excitations of the electron plasma in the metal film – towards that particular hole. Subsequent 

plasmon  scattering  at  the  hole  boundaries  or/and  on  the  back  side  of  the  film  allows  to 

recover the plasmon energy under the form of light with the same wavelength as the incident 

light [10]. We demonstrate below that this selective launching and scattering of 2D plasmons 

allows for a remote, surface-plasmon-mediated addressing of the underlying optically active 

medium.  

In  our  demonstration,  the  active  medium  is  made  of  self-assembled  CdTe 

semiconductor QDs grown by Atomic-Layer Epitaxy [11]. The growth sequence includes a 

ZnTe buffer layer, a 2.1 nm thick CdTe layer, and a protecting 30 nm ZnTe cap layer. In this 

2 

CdTe/ZnTe  system,  carrier  confinement  to  zero  dimension  is  ensured  by  Cd-rich  islands 
(typical density of 5 x 1010 cm-2, average height and width of 7 nm and 15 nm, respectively) 

that  form  due  to  elastic  relaxation  of  the  strained  CdTe  layer.  A  hollowed  metal  film  is 

deposited  onto  this  semiconductor  surface  according  to  the  following  “lift-off”  procedure.  

We  first  disperse  commercially  available  latex  beads  with  a  diameter  of  240  nm  on  the 

surface, then evaporate a 70 nm thick aluminum layer (sufficient to ensure opacity to visible 

light)  by  vacuum  evaporation,  and  finally  dissolve  the  latex  nanospheres  in  an  organic 

solvent.  Optical  information  is  subsequently  gained  from  this  QD  medium  by  far  field 

collection  of  the  low-temperature  (4.2  K)  luminescence  emitted  by  single  CdTe  QDs  [12] 

located  underneath  the  selected  nanohole.  The  low-temperature  NSOM  microscope  used  in 

this study has been described elsewhere [9]. 

Figure  2a)  shows a  2  µm  x  2  µm  reflection  image  exhibiting  two  dark  spots  on  its 

upper and left borders due to two nanoholes located at these positions. These two apertures 

are labelled  H1  and  H2,  respectively.  As  shown in fig.  2b),  the  H1 nanohole luminescence 

spectrum, i.e. the luminescence spectrum recorded with the optical tip exciting the upper hole 

position  (H1), consists  of  a  set  of  very  sharp lines  that  are  typical for the  atomic-like  shell 

structure [12-14] of the underlying dots. In the most general case, these sharp peaks are due 

to radiative recombinations of various multi-exciton states, either electrically neutral [13] or 

negatively  charged  [14],  that  can  take  place  in  several  close-lying  QDs.  This  luminescence 

information  is  unique  for  a  given  set  of  dots  which  vary  in  size,  composition,  and  local 

density [11]. As a consequence, it forms a spectral fingerprint of a particular nanohole in the 

metal layer that is unique for this particular hole. 

In  order  to  understand  the  effect  of  rotating  the  light  polarization  on  the  QD 

luminescence,  we first  need  to  find  a reliable  method  to  determine  in  situ  this  polarization. 

This is achieved by analyzing the high-contrast reflection image in fig. 3 where 3 nanoholes 

appear  as  three-lobe  structures  made  of  two  bright  spots  separated  by  a  marked,  slightly 

elongated, dark spot. This identifies the light polarization as being perpendicular to the axis 

joining  the  two  bright  spots,  as  revealed  by  the  simulation  in  fig.  3c),  where  the 

electromagnetic  field  created  by  an  optical  tip  has  been  viewed  as  emanating  from  two 

crossed radiating dipoles located in the tip aperture plane, namely an electric dipole Ptip and a 

magnetic dipole Mtip, with the electric dipole aligned with the incident polarization [7,15]. In 

the case of the optical tip facing the aluminum coating which is considered as a perfect metal, 

the reflected image dipoles are such that Pimage= - Ptip and Mimage= Mtip. As a result, the total 

field acting on a hole situated in the vicinity of the tip is a magneto-static dipolar field only, 

to which the hole reacts like an effective magnetic dipole Mhole [7,16]. The recorded far-field 

 

3 

intensity  is  directly  proportional to  ‰ 2Mtip+Mhole‰ 2.  This  yields  the  simulated image  of  fig. 

3c), which is in qualitative agreement with the experiment. In the simulation, the hole itself 

has  been  viewed  as  being  perfectly  transparent.  Rotating  the  excitation    polarization  in  the 

optical fiber by means of a paddle-polarization-controller arranged in the optical path rotates 

the  3-lobe  structures  of  fig.3  accordingly,  thereby  providing  us  with  the  desired  in-situ 

determination of light polarization. 

To investigate the light polarization effect on the luminescence spectra, two intense 

peaks are isolated from the reference spectrum of fig. 2b) and their intensity is  analyzed as a 

function  of  the  excitation  polarization  (the  reference  polarization  state,  named  “0°-

polarization” in the following, is marked by an arrow on the H2 nanohole, fig. 2a)). As seen 

in  fig. 2c), the  polarization rotation has almost no effect on the luminescence intensity when 

the tip is located directly over the H1 nanohole (point 1). This is because in the absence of 

external  fields,  the  CdTe  QDs  are  unpolarized  in  the  sense  that  they  provide  isotropic 

emission. However, the situation changes in a dramatic way as soon as the tip is positioned  

further  away  from  the  nanohole  as  shown  on  fig.  2d)  and  2e)  for  tip  positions  2  and  5, 

respectively.  Here,  the  experiment  clearly  reveals  a  preferential  polarization  state  that 

enhances the luminescence intensity.  

Our  results  are  summarized  on  fig.  2a)  where  an  arrow  indicates  the  particular 

direction  that  magnifies  the  corresponding  nanohole  response  for  each  of  the  four  studied 

points  around  nanohole  H1.  A  clear  trend  is  revealed  in  fig.  2a):  the  hole  signature  is 

enhanced for electric field orientations pointing essentially towards the hole, irrespective of 

the launching point. Remaining small offsets can arise from plasmon scattering due to metal 

roughness. This demonstrates that the excitation necessary for stimulating emission from the 

nanohole  is  transported  to  the  latter  on  the  surface  of  the  metal  film  which  is  opaque  to 

incident light. 

A demanding test of the surface plasmon scenario already anticipated comes from the 

belavior  of  the  luminescence  intensity.  Within  this  scenario,  the  collected  luminescence 

intensity should be proportional to the surface-plasmon intensity

Figure 4 compares the angular and radial dependences of the luminescence intensity 

with  the  expected  behavior  for  surface  plasmons  (here,  we  only  consider  the  low-energy 

component  of  the  doublet  discussed  on  fig.  2,  the  high-energy  component  and  other  peaks 

behave  in  the  same  way).  The  agreement  is  excellent  for  the  actual  material  parameters  in 

aluminum,  which  gives  strong  support  to  the  surface  plasmon  interpretation.  In  “plasmon 

metals”, such as silver, or for excitation light close to the plasmon resonance,  the plasmon 

attenuation  length  is  much  larger  [19]  which  would allow  for  object  addressing  from  more 

remote tip positions. However, the lateral propagation of surface plasmons, which manifests 
itself in the  f  dependence of 

, may in turn cause limitations in the addressing accuracy. 

spI

Therefore, aluminum offers a good compromise for the purpose of a first demonstration. 

 

We have introduced a simple optical way of remotely addressing single nano-objects. 

This  method  makes  use  of  the  control  of  light  polarization  at  the  apex  of  an  optical  tip  to 

direct at will the excitation into sub-wavelength apertures hollowed into a thin metal coating 

deposited  onto  the  active  medium.  The  excitation  is  mediated  by  surface  plasmons. 

Therefore, it can be launched from any point to any other point within the attenuation length 

of surface plasmons. As a consequence, the objects to address may be dispersed almost freely 

on the surface, or even below the metal surface like in the present experiment, providing that 

some indivuals remain accessible through a nanohole. Since most of the active objects placed 

 

5

(cid:181)
ﬁ
directly  on  the  metal  surface  are  expected  to  quench  due  to  the  strong  interaction  of  their 

transition dipole with the image dipole in the metal, the method should be only sensitive to  

those  objects  located  in  or  just  underneath  a  nanohole.  Other  promising  features  of  our 

approach include: i) the nanohole diameter fits with the initial latex-bead diameter and can be 

tuned accordingly over a wide range; ii) the average distance between neighboring holes can 

be controlled freely by adequatly choosing the bead concentration; iii) the initial nanospheres 

can  be  dispersed  onto  nanostructured  surfaces  which,  as  can  be  anticipated,  may  help  in 

arranging  the  final  nanoholes  in  a  well-defined  manner.  This  could  lead  to  extraordinary 

cooperative effects [21]. Furthermore, various optically active nano-objects can be addressed, 

such  as  single  molecules  [2,3,22]  or  nanocrystals  [23],  not  only  QDs  at  low  temperature. 

Therefore, we believe that our method opens a way to a large variety of optical experiments 

in the nanoworld, with possible applications for the optical addressing of quantum bits and 

experiments with single and entangled photons [24].

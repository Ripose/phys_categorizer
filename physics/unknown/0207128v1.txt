The  propagation  of  photon  in  a  dielectric  may  be  described  with  the  help  of  the  scalar  and 

vector  potentials  of  the  medium.  The  main  novelty  of  the  paper  is  that  the  concept  of  the 

vector  potential  (which  is  connected  with  the  velocity  of  the  medium)  can  be  extended  to 

relativistic velocities of the medium. The positionـdependent photon wave function was used 

to  describe  the  propagation  of  the  photon.  The  new  concepts  of  the  velocity  of  photon  as 

particle and the photon mass in the dielectric medium were proposed.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Consider  a  photon  in  a  dielectric  medium.  But  what  photon  really  is?  In  modern  physics 

photon is nothing more than quantum excitation of the electromagnetic field. We have learned 

from  quantum  electrodynamics,  that  in  the  dielectric,  in  fact,  there  are  no  photons  but 

polaritons,  i.e.  excitations  of  electromagnetic  field  coupled  to  the  medium.  However  a 

different  point  of  view  is  also  possible.  Remember  the  case  of  electron  in  an  external 

electromagnetic  field.  On  the  first  quantization  level  the  electron  is  treated  as  a  quantum 

object moving in the classical field. In this paper I develop a similar description for  a photon. 

The photon treated as a quantum object (cid:145)feels(cid:146) the medium as an external classical field. To 

describe a photon in terms of a oneـparticle wave function, i.e., on the first quantization level, 

I follow the way presented in [1ـ3]. Another approach was proposed in [4]. The concept of the 

positionـrepresentation  photon  wave  function  has  a  long  history  and  is  still  controversial. 

Nevertheless I do not want to discuss the question here. The reader interested in this problem 

is referred to [1−4] and references therein.  

The  paper  is  organized  in  the  following  way.  In  Section  2,  I  develop  the  description  of  a 

photon  in  medium  in  terms  of  the  photon  wave  function.  Some  attempts  of  this  kind  have 

been  presented  in  [1ـ3].  What  is  new  in  my  approach  is  to  show  that  the  influence  of  the 

medium on the photon can be described through some potentials. Though generally the idea is 

not new, see e.g. [5ـ6], but here I realize it within the formalism of the photon wave function. 

On  this  basis,  in  Section  3,  the  nonzero  mass  of  photon  and  the  concept  of  the  velocity  of 

photon as a particle appear in a quite natural way. The velocity of photon is different from the 

phase or group velocity and, up to my knowledge, is a new concept. 

I show in Section 4 that the motion of the dielectric can be  connected with the optical analog 

of  the  vector  potential.  This  idea  has  been  already  presented  in  literature,  see  papers  [7ـ8]. 

What is new here is that the concept of the vector potential of the medium can be extended for 

 

2 

relativistic velocities of the medium. With the help of the scalar and vector potentials of the 

medium one can define some optical analogs of electric and magnetic fields, and the optical 

analog  of  the  Lorentz  force  (acting  on  the  photon  in the medium). The potentials  are  gauge 

fields and the analogs of electric and magnetic fields are gauge invariant.  

2. THE SCALAR POTENTIAL OF MEDIUM 

In papers [1ـ3] the following form of the Schr(cid:246)dinger equation for free photon was proposed

p = −iћ∇ ـ momentum of photon;    

(Si)k l = −i ε i k l  ـ spin photon matrix   (ε i k l ـ antisymmetric LeviـCivita symbol ). 

On the classical language, the equations are equivalent to the following Maxwell equations 

∂ t E  =  c ∇  ×  H   ;   ∂ t H  =  − c ∇  ×  E   ;    D  =   E   ;    B  =  H  , 

describing free fields in vacuum. Since all the information carried by function  F  is contained 

in its positive energy (positive frequency) part 

, following [3], I take this part as the true 

(+F

)

photon wave function and denote it as ψ 

= Fψ

(+

 )

  

To  become  a  complete  set  of  Maxwell  equations,  eq.(3)  must  be  supplied  by  divergence 

conditions ∇⋅⋅⋅⋅E = 0, ∇⋅⋅⋅⋅H = 0. It is equivalent to the relation p ⋅⋅⋅⋅ψ = 0.  

In order to describe the propagation of photon in dielectric, one should include in Hamiltonian 

the interaction term. On the microscopic level, such interaction is rather complicated, but here 

I will take it into account in a phenomenological way. Let us begin with stationary states of 

the photon in a homogeneous dielectric. For a stationary state the wave function takes on the

The propagating photon in every time and in every space point, (cid:145)feels(cid:146) the same coupling with 

the medium. We may try to describe the interaction by a single constant coupling value Ωω. If 

some  inhomogeneities  are  in  the  dielectric,  then  the  interaction  depends  on  r  and  will  be 

modeled by a function Ωω(r). Sometimes, I want to restrict considerations to the nonـmagnetic 

media, i.e., µ =1. It means that the medium is coupled only to the electric part of the photon 

wave function. Generally, the couplings of the medium with the electric and magnetic part of 

the wave function may be different. To take it into account I introduce two real and symmetric 

matrices γ and η which split the wave function ψω  into electric and magnetic parts

The projection operators γ, η fulfill the following relations i.e.: γ 2 = γ , η 2 = η , γ η = 0 . Thus 

the case of the propagating photon in inhomogeneous nonmagnetic dielectric can be modeled 

in the following way

I interpret the term Ωω (r) γ  as a potential energy operator of the photon in dielectric. In order 

to see what is the meaning of the quantity Ωω (r) in the classical language, one may translate 

equation (9) into the ordinary form of nonـvacuum Maxwell equations

where             χω (r) =

Thus Ωω (r) is directly connected with the dielectric susceptibility χω (r).  

It is easy to generalize this approach and write Maxwell equations for dispersive media in a 

form of Schr(cid:246)dinger equation. If simultaneously many frequencies are present in the medium, 

then it is reasonable to expect (from the quantum mechanical point of view ـ indistinguishable 

alternatives) that the interaction of medium with the photon in such a nonـstationary state is 

described  by  superposition  of  singleـfrequency  interaction  terms.  Thus,  if  the  photon  is 

described by a wave packet ψ(t, r), then the interaction of the packet with the medium can be 

described by an integral operator 

(cid:136)Ω in the following way

3. THE MASS AND VELOCITY OF PHOTON IN THE MEDIUM 

When  the  couplings  with  the  electrical  and  magnetic  parts  are  taken  into  account,  the 

Schr(cid:246)dinger equation takes on the form

 Ωω(r),  Γω(r)  have  interpretation  of  potential  energies.  Γω(r)  is  connected  with  magnetic 

susceptibility  χm

ω(r)  =  (1/4π)  Γω(r)/ћω.  In  order  to  obtain  the  connection  between  the  total 

energy and momentum one may iterate this equation. In the case of a homogeneous medium 

one obtains

The  term    nω

2  ω  2    mixes  the  kinetic  and  potential  terms  of  the  Schr(cid:246)dinger  equation  (16). 

From my point of view it is more natural to interpret the equation (17) in another way. That is, 

to put 

h≡E

It is apparent that E is the energy of a massive relativistic particle in an external field. Thus the 

photon in dielectric gains the mass m given by 

The photon gains the mass, because of the interaction with the (cid:145)sea(cid:146) of charges in dielectric. It 

reminds the Feynman(cid:146)s remark: (cid:132)mass is interactions(cid:148). The term 

is  a  (cid:145)classical(cid:146)  potential  energy.  It  confirms  the  previous  interpretation  of  the  quantities  Ωω 

and Γω as some potential energies. The equation (22) predicts that the mass of photon becomes 

zero not only in empty space (when Ωω and Γω vanish) but also when Ωω = Γω (equivalently 

εω = µω).   

Thus the wave equation (17) takes on the form of the KleinـGordon equation

Note that v is velocity of photon as a particle. It never exceeds c. The remarkable feature is 

that v is equal to c not only in empty space but also if εω = µω (as one should expect because 

then the photon mass is zero). Knowing m and v one can calculate the photon momentum

In the nonـdispersive case (∂n/∂ω = 0) the group velocity is equal to the phase velocity. On the 

other hand the group velocity vg is equal to v in the independent of ω case (∂Ω/∂ω = 0, ∂Γ/∂ω 

= 0). I think that one should consider the possibility that v is really the true velocity of photon 

in  dielectric.  Certainly,  the  velocity  of  photon  in  dielectric  medium  is  not  the  question  of 

definition. The answer can give only an experiment. 

Note that  ω

h  plays two distinct roles in the above description. It is the total energy and apart 

it is a parameter determining photonـmedium interaction. It is the reason why the right hand 

side of the equation (21) depends on ω .  

At the end of this section I briefly comment the case of the wave packet

For every Fourier component of the packet one may write Schr(cid:246)dinger equation (16) and thus 

KleinـGordon  equation  (24).  Because  of  different  particle  velocities  v  the  wave  packet 

disperses.  If  the  dispersion  of  velocities  is  ∆v the width  of  the  packet is (in one dimension) 

increasing in time as ∆x = ∆v⋅ t . The packet describes one photon in a nonـstationary state (the 

energy and the mass of the photon are not precisely determined) and ∆x is the region in which 

it is possible to detect it. Usually the beam of light contains many photons. It means that all 

the photons  are in the  same oneـparticle nonـstationary state  (30). Now, in the region ∆x you 

can detect many photons in different points at the same time. Probability is proportional to the 

rate  of  detection,  and  thus  to  the  energy  density  in  given  point.  You  have  a  macroscopic 

quantum state. 

4. THE VECTOR POTENTIAL OF THE MEDIUM 

Developing  analogy  with  the  theory  of  charged  particles  it  is  interesting  to  construct  and 

examine consequences of vector potential of the medium A in the case of photon. Replacing 

p

, where p is kinetical and P canonical momentum, the Schr(cid:246)dinger equation (16) 

becomes

To  determine  the  situation,  I  suppose  that  the  light  source  emitting  photons  of  energies  ћω 

rests with respect to the observer. Then, as will be shown, the physical meaning of the vector 

potential of the medium is directly connected with the velocity u of the medium. Note, there is 

no Doppler shift between the observer and the source and therefore the observed frequency is 

the same as the source frequency. 

Expressing the Schr(cid:246)dinger equation (31) in the classical language one finds

where   a =  (

is a dimensionless vector potential of the medium.  

This  may  be  compared  with  the  nonrelativistic  approximation  of  the  Minkowski  relations 

[9ـ10] obliging for uniformly moving dielectric: 

D  =  ε ω E  +  (ε ω µ ω − 1)  ββββr

 × H  ,              B  =  µ ω H  −  (ε ω µ ω − 1)  ββββr

 × E  , 

(33) 

where  ββββr   =  u  /  c.  One  finds  immediately  the  connection  between  vector  potential  a  and  the 

velocity u of the medium    

a  = (εω µω − 1)  ββββr

  . 

(34) 

The result is in agreement with papers [7ـ8], where it has been obtained in another way.  

If  one  wants  to  examine  the  purely  relativistic  velocities  case,  the  form  of  the  Schr(cid:246)dinger 

equation  (31)  must  be  changed.  One  reason  is  that  in  the  nonrelativistic  velocities  case  we 

assumed  that  the  couplings  with  the  medium  are  the  same  as  in  the  case  of  the  resting 

medium.  It  does  not  need  be  true.  The  second  reason  is  that  the  moving  medium  in  fact 

produces anisotropy of the whole system. This is not taken into account in the nonrelativistic 

velocities  case.  Therefore  one  should  admit  that  the  couplings  for  fields  perpendicular  and 

parallel  with  respect  to  the  velocity  of  the  medium ββββr

  may  be  different.  Thus  one  should 

consider the following Schr(cid:246)dinger equation

Our task is to find the relativistic form of A = (ћω/c) a. I look for the solution in the form

a  = α (β)   ββββr

where  α (β)    is  yet  unknown  function.  Expressing  the  Schr(cid:246)dinger  equation  (35)  in  the

and as well the other parameters as ε || ω , ε ⊥ ω , etc. 

For  a  uniformly  moving  homogeneous  medium  the  result  (39)  is  exact.  To  a  good 

approximation  it  can  be  useful  as  well  in  the  case  of  nonuniformly  moving  inhomogeneous 

medium provided that the potentials Ω, Γ and the flow u vary only gradually, i.e., do not vary 

significantly over one optical wave length and one optical cycle. 

For  nonrelativistic  velocities  one  can  immediately  write  connection  between  energy  and 

momentum simply by substitution in eq.(21)

It  is  possible  because (as one can easily  check  with  the help of  Maxwell  equations  (32)) the 

divergence condition ∇⋅⋅⋅⋅D = 0, ∇⋅⋅⋅⋅B = 0 is equivalent to the condition p ⋅⋅⋅⋅ψ = 0 (similarly as it 

 

11 

was  in  the  case  of the  resting  medium).  The eq.(40) is exact for  uniformly moving medium, 

and a good approximation in the case of nonuniformly moving inhomogeneous medium. Note 

that the mass of photon is the same as it was in resting medium. 

If  one  wants  to  iterate  the  relativistic  Schr(cid:246)dinger  equation  (35)  it  will  be  advantageous  to 

write it in the more suitable form

where projection operators R|| and R⊥ have been defined in the following way: R|| V = V|| and 

R⊥ V = V⊥ (V is a vector, || and ⊥ with respect to the velocity of the medium). The R|| and R⊥ 

commute  with  γ,  η.  The  Hamiltonian  Hf  has  the  same  structure  as  in  the  case  of  resting 

medium but now

. Another useful relations are Hf γ + γ Hf = Hf ,  Hf η + η Hf = Hf  

and Hf R||  + R|| Hf = Hf − Hf

|| ,  Hf R⊥  + R⊥ Hf = Hf +Hf

||  . The Hamiltonian Hf

|| differs from Hf 

in such a way that p⋅⋅⋅⋅ S is replaced by p||⋅⋅⋅⋅ S. In general the obtained result of iteration is rather 

complicated  and  I  will  not  write  it  down.  I  only  examine  here  the  simplest  but  physically 

interesting case when the light in form of plane wave propagates in the same direction as the 

medium  moves.  In  this  case  the  result  has  exactly  the  same  form  as  eq.(40)  with  the  only 

difference that Ωω is replaced by Ω⊥ω and Γω by Γ⊥ω . In particular, the mass of photon mβ  in 

the relativistic case is given by

where m = |εω − µω| ћω /2c2 is the mass of photon in the rest medium. At first, it might seem 

queer  that  the  mass  has  changed  but  it  must  be  so,  because  the  mass  of  photon  in  medium 

(never  mind  resting  or  moving)  is  always  determined  by  the couplings (Ω and Γ)  and these 

couplings in the moving medium have changed. The change  of  mass does not appear in the 

nonrelativistic velocities case because it is only the second order effect (with respect to β).

In  the  following  I  restrict  considerations  to  the  nonrelativistically  moving  media  which,  no 

doubt, is reasonable from practical point of view. It is interesting that in some limited sense it 

is possible to develop (cid:145)photodynamics(cid:146) ـ describing behavior of photon, in close analogy to the 

electrodynamics  ـ  as  the  theory  of  charged  particles.  In  particular  one  can  determine  a 

(cid:145)classical(cid:146) force F acting on photon

5. SUMMARY 

I find that the influence of the medium on photon can be described by some scalar and vector 

potentials.  Scalar  potentials  are  directly  connected  with  permittivity  and  permeability  of  the 

medium, vector potential is connected with the velocity of the medium. The main novelty in 

the  paper  is  that  the  notion  of  vector  potential  of  the  medium  can  be  constructed  also  for 

relativistic  velocities  of  the  medium.  Another  new  results  are  the  formulas  for  the  mass  of 

photon in resting and moving dielectric and the velocity of photon as particle. The velocity is 

different from phase and group velocity. Quite interesting is the fact that the photon velocity is 

equal to c not only in vacuum but also if εω

 = µω. A consequence of describing the medium 

through scalar and vector potentials is existence of analogs of  (cid:145)electric(cid:146) and (cid:145)magnetic(cid:146) fields, 

as well as the optical Lorentz force which describe the influence of the medium on the photon. 

The same as in the theory of charged particles the potentials are gauge fields and (cid:145)electric(cid:146) and 

(cid:145)magnetic(cid:146) fields are gauge invariant.

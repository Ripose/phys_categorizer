ABSTRACT 
Alterations of charges density on membranes (potentials) of plant cells by ion currents lead to 
disbalance of Coulomb forces compressing membranes and counteracting Hookean elastic 
forces. It should results in membrane vibrations till establishment new equilibrium with 
generation of ultrasound and electromagnetic radiations. Such vibrations lead to acoustical flows, 
power of which is sufficient for water lift in trees, its degassing, for cycloses and some electric 
phenomena in plants and so on. This phenomenon explains the known observations of ultrasound 
noises in trees and redistribution of particles in the phloem flow. Known supervisions and 
consideration of anatomy of plants result in estimations of frequencies of the order of 150-200 
kHz for acoustical flows in xilem and three times bigger in phloem. The checking of offered 
mechanism can be carrying out via investigation of acoustic and electromagnetic radiation of 
plants.

1. Introduction and qualitative description 
 
     Some basic phenomena of plant physiology, that must be described by physics or, at least, 
coordinated with it, have not up till now the common explanation. Among such phenomena are 
hydraulics of trees (xylem transport and phloem flow), cyclosis, i.e. the movements of cytoplasm 
within a plant (or even animal) cell, deletion of emboling gas bubbles and bypass of defeat 
sections at water transport, the origin of electrical potentials and their distribution and variation 
over tree, e.g. [1].  
     So, the lifting of water in trees up to height 100 m demands search of especial pumping 
effects. The explanation of this lifting via cohesive features of pure water was offered about 
century ago by Dixon and Joly [2] and was criticized by many experts. We do not reiterate their 
arguments, which are comprehensively set out e.g. in the review article [3] with extensive 
literature references (note only cavitation phenomena in vessels, that completely discreditate the 
cohesive hypothesis, e.g. [4, 5]). 
    We shall consider such model which can explain some phenomena of plants physiology: 
alteration of potential of charged cell membranes induce their mechanical vibrations together 
with cell walls, i.e. generate acoustic waves, whose frequencies are in the ultrasound region and 
radiated power of a lot of cells become sufficient for observed effects. (The hypothesis of 
ultrasound role in water transport had been announced in [6, 7], but without revealing of their 
origin.)   
     Physical foundation of this effect is such. Both sides of some part of membrane with more or 
less chaotically distributed charges represent the electrical capacitor or the double electric layer. 
This transmembrane potential can be different in different parts of cell and alterated with time 
(ion currents and so on). In such "structure" Coulomb forces pulls plates together and 
compresses its content, but the elastic Hookean forces of membrane withstand them and together

they maintains an equilibrium. If charge densities, i.e. the transmembrane potential will be 
changed, it will upset the balance of powers and this part of membrane will begin to vibrate with 
damping till establishment of new equilibrium state: these processes can be considered as the 
parametric oscillations, which generate acoustic (in our case ultrasound) and electromagnetic 
waves of the same frequencies. 
     The ultrasound radiation (USR) from different cells or even from parts of single cell would be 
independent, i.e. these vibrations will be integrally resulted as an acoustic noise with some 
possible distribution of frequencies and so on, but the noise of sufficient power is enough for 
considered phenomena. Such features complicate its direct registration, but as the considered 
processes should be accompanied by electromagnetic radiation on the same frequencies, the 
registration should be possible by more apprehensible electromagnetic devices.  
    At dissipation of acoustic wave in medium its energy is thermalized, but its momentum must 
lead to motion of some constituents of medium and in a liquid substance it generates so named 
acoustic flow [8]. Acoustic flows have the unique peculiarity: more dense constituents acquire 
bigger momentum and can outstrip liquid, in which they move. Just such type of motion was 
observed in [9]: in the horizontal vine big particles (radoactively labelled glizins, xylose particles, 
vitamins) moved faster than phloem flux which carrier them. 
     The USR oscillations appearing in the root cells will propagate into xylem vessels where the 
resistance of water flow is considerable lower than at any other side: capillar columns existing in 
them play a role of directed acoustoguides. 
     Let's briefly mention, before numerical estimations, some qualitative features of proposed 
USR flows. USR waves must lead to degassing of xylem flow; remember that the problem of 
embolie is a critical one for the Dixon- Joly approach. Near to a place of damage of xylem 
channel this acoustic flow will redirect water to bypass this place by leakage through cell walls 
into other channels. At trees felling their root system some period continue work, i.e. generate 
USR, but wave reflected from the exterior surface will interfere with initial wave that leads to 
their attenuation; therefore the "weeping" of trees is comparatively weak. Among other 
properties it is known that USR has thixatropic activity: it leads to comparative liquefaction of 
gum into living trees and to possibility of its deallocation.  
     We shall begin with consideration of vibrations of membranes, together with their walls, at 
alteration of charges density that result in corresponding acoustic and electromagnetic radiations 
(Section 2, another approach is given in the Appendix). In the Section 3 some simple heuristic 
estimation of frequencies limits based on direct usage of observations data are considered; 
whereupon the more strict calculations with taking into account anatomy of water and sap 
conducting vessels are performed. It leads also to some estimation of flows velocity and power.  
      In the Section 4 the electrical phenomena accompanying acoustic flow are considered, it 
gives, in particular, additional possibility for estimation of the main magnitude, the frequency of 
USR. In the Section 5 are enumerated some different questions related to the offered theory. The 
main results are briefly summed in the Conclusions. 
 
2. Membrane vibrations 
 
   For estimations of forces and frequencies such parameters of cells will be used [10]: 
Standard thickness of biomembrane h ∼ 10 nm;  
Thickness of plant cell wall H ∼ 1÷10 mcm;  
Mean electrical potential on membrane is of order U ≤  0.1 V;  
Specific surface capacity C/S = 1 pF/mm2; 
Electrical resistance of breakdown R/S = 102 ÷ 105 Ω/cm2;  
Mechanical properties are determined by the Young's modulus Y: the longitudinal modulus Y' ∼ 
109 Pa, but for transversal forces it must be sufficiently lower and Y ∼ 106 ÷ 107 Pa can be taken.

The magnitude of this pressure for taken data is of order p ≈ 1 Pa. 
     At a charge breakdown on the section S the membrane and its connected wall come into 
motion together, i.e. the oscillating mass m = ρSH, where ρ is their mean density. Therefore the 
equation of motion at action of electric force becomes:

    Its solution in the form ∆h = A sin(2πf t) directly leads to an estimation of frequency:

this is close to values estimated below by other methods. 
     Let's estimate parameters of electrical current at such breakdown. Every elementary charge 
(ion channel) is located on an area of order S1 ∼ 3 ÷ 5 nm2. Thus at simultaneous breakdown of 
section S ∼ 100 ÷ 1000 nm2 through membrane can be transferred current I ≈ ef (S/S1) ∼ 1 ÷ 10 
pA, here an estimation (2.4) was used. 
      The frequency of oscillations generated by charges transition can be independently estimated 
via velocity of ions transverse diffusion through membrane. The coefficient of diffusion is of 
order D ≈ h2f/2. As at the ion transport D = (1 ÷ 5) 10−7 cm2/s [11], it leads to     
f' ∼ 2D/h2 ∼ 0.2 ÷ 1 MHz,                                                                              (2.5) 
very close to (2.4). 
    Now we must estimate the energy of generated waves and its possibility to powered, for 
example, cytoplasm at cyclosis.  
     The energy of ultrasound vibration 
WUSR = p2/ρc2,                                                                                                     (2.6) 
where c = 1.5⋅105 cm/s is the sound speed in water. As the velocity of cytoplasm streaming v ∼ 
10 mcm/s (e.g. [11]), the equaling of (2.6) with kinetic energy of powered area of liquid  
W/S = mv2/2S = ρLv2/2,  
where L is the depth of powered mass, leads to L ∼ 0.1 mm, which seems non contradictory and 
can explain some manifestations of cyclosis. 
 
3. Water lift and phloem flow 
 
There are several possibilities for estimation of US frequencies on base of plant physiology. We 
shall begin with the simplest ones.

     More one simple estimation is connected with possible degassing of lifted flux. The degassing 
is maximal, as is known from the USR practice, at 
 kHz.                                                                                                    (3.3)

     From the heuristic principle of biological expedientness it can be expected that really induced 
frequencies would be close to (3.3). 
 
3-2. ELECTROACOUSTIC ANALOGIES 
      All these estimations can give some very preliminary heuristic values and therefore more 
strict examinations are needed. 
     In many articles on plant physiology the analogy with the Ohm law at consideration of liquid 
flows is used. But real situation is much complicate and requires the consideration of 
electroacoustic analogy with electric circuits of alternating current (e.g. [12]). 
     Let us consider such analogies. With tracheid cell can be compared the acoustical capacity

     These estimations seem the most substantiated. But they can vary for different species; for 
conifers, where liquid transfer between vessels take place by leakage through membrane pores, 
must be considered the "equivalent" pore diameters and so on. (The comparatively close of 
estimations deduced by several considerations including below one must be also underlined.)  
    Frequencies of USR generated in a crown of tree may be estimated just via (3.9) with a and l 
as radius of perforations and thickness of upper cells plates. It will leads to bigger frequencies of 
the order of 0.5 MHz. 
    But there is also more one independent possibility for estimations of phloem flux. 
    As was mention above there was observed a selectivity of phloem transport [9]. It must be 
connected with dependence of acoustic pressure on dimensions and density of moving particles

     Let us try to estimate the velocity of liquid flux in such USR field on the base of 
electroacoustical analogue. 
    The delay of USR in the single cell (the time duration till leaving the cell) is determined by the 
usual relation for harmonic oscillator [15]:

which is represented as reasonable even without account of viscosity. 
     The account of viscosity reduces this estimation. So with the Poisseuille formulae for a tree of

     This value seems consistent with other estimations. 
     In the well known investigation [16] Eckart determined the velocity of acoustic flow as 
v

This expression consists at frequencies (3.9), (3.11) and a redundant pressure p = 1÷10 atm with 
a sap velocity of the order of 1 m/hour. 
     The estimation of USR power needed for such movement is the most complicate at our 
approach. Its part directly useful for liquids motion is of order 
 and for a single xilem 
channel is of order 10−7 W, which does not seems over-big. The thermic losses can be estimated 
via the acoustical analog of the Bougier law

4. Electrical phenomena accompanied liquids transport 
 
    Let's single out effects which become apparent in the conducting vessels and lead to 
appearance of potentials on comparatively big parts of trees stem. Their magnitudes are 
characterized by slow alterations with seasons, day time, atmospheric humidity, mineral fatten, 
e.g. [17]. 
    These phenomena can be explainable on the base of the Debay effect [18]: in a weak electrolite 
ions form solvates (e.g. Na+⋅7H2O; K+⋅6H2O; Mg2+⋅15H2O; Cl−⋅H2O), which due the

electrostriction have increased density and therefore acquire in the USR current higher velocity; 
which leads to appearing of the Debay potentials. 
     Inasmuch as all needed conditions are present in trees sap, the appearance of Debay potential 
and its alterations are their inevitable consequences. So in the dry weather a predominant lifting 
of alkaline ions over xilem must leads to positive charging of trees top and at high humidity, vice 
versa, more positive ions will go down with the phloem current: top of tree will be charged 
negatively (cf. [19]). 
     Since USR flux must go around affected parts it will wash out solvates: in such places appear 
the potential of affection. 
      Electrophysiological data gives additional possibility for estimation of USR frequency. 
Really, in accordance with [20] at weak alterations of potential its values are repeated at distances 
of order 0.5 cm along conducting ways. It evidently means the existence of wave processes with 
wave length of 1 cm, i.e. with the frequency of USR

5. Some additional comments and propositions 
 
♦5-1. USR emissions of plants are registered by some investigators (e.g. [21, 22, 23]) in the 
diapason of 0.1÷2 MHz, but without further analysis of spectra. 
     The authors tried to connect these noises with cavitation in vessels or with freezing. But even 
an absence of the dependence of USR intensity on wood-fibre length shows that cavitation can 
not be a common or unique source of noise.  
♦5-2. Inasmuch as displacement of charges induces oscillation of membranes, the reciprocal 
effect must also exist: induced oscillation of membranes by external source on frequencies close 
to resonance ones would increase the speed of ions transportation into and out of cells. If the 
power of USR does not exceed admissible magnitudes, such influence will increase methabolism 
and so on. Bigger power would destroy cells. (Note that it can give key for explaining some 
observations of the musical and noise influence on plants.) 
    All these effects were observed experimentally (e.g. the review [24]). Experimentalists usually 
used frequencies of 400 and 800 kHz, standard for medical practice, but these frequencies are 
comparatively near to our estimations. For purposeful investigations the examinations with 
varying frequencies will be, of course, preferable.  
♦5-3. The cell with opposite charges on external and internal surfaces can be considered as a 
spherical condensor formed by double electric layers. Such structures, as was discovered 
theoretically and experimentally [25, 26], emit radiowaves at alternative mechanical (acoustical) 
influence and vice versa, at that on the main frequencies and their harmonics (see Appendix).  
   All this predicts possibility of plants control by external electromagnetic radiation on resonant 
frequencies or their harmonics.  
    On the other hand it means opportunities of plant connection with each others via acoustical 
and/or electromagnetic fields. Such possibilities can be treated as an existence of especial 
"biological field" (compare e.g. [27]). 
♦5-4. By existence of USR flux can be explainated some taxises, motor activity of plants, etc.  
     The interesting problems are connected with organelles movement in directed fashion in 
mechanically perturbed cells [28]: stimulation with a glass capillary induces chloroplast migration 
away from the point of contact, etc. There is forward a proposal that plant membranes have 

stretch-activated channel activity that may be responsible for triggering ion flux changes in 
response to a mechanical membrane perturbation, i.e. in accordance with our hypothesis 
mechanical perturbation changes USR emission and corresponding field of forces.  
     In the ultrasound field are observed some phenomena [29], which can play definite roles in 
plants also. So USR in plants can promote the nitrogen fixation reactions, oppress some kinds of 
bacteries, etc. 
♦5-5. Can be considered analogical phenomena in the animal cells? 
    Note that the more little animal cells do not have cell walls. Therefore in them would oscillate 
much thinner membrane, i.e. instead of H in (2.4) must be taken h and possibly bigger values of 
Young's modulus, Y' instead Y. It leads to the estimation:

 MHz.                                                   (5.1) 

     Such frequencies (hypersound) are rapidly extinguished. 
      Emission of frequencies of such order was proposed in the known theory of Fröhlich, e.g. 
[30,31]. There are some observations in the favour of existence this radiation, e.g. [32], but the 
problem can not be considered as solved or closed (cf. another approach to possibilities of 
electromagnetic radiation [33]). Note that with plants all possible investigations seem easier and 
their results would be the vital for all biology. 
      Let's remark that there are a set of phenomena, in which can be seek, in principle, possibility 
of acoustical influence: hydraulic muscles of insects, motion of some protozoa and so on. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
Let's sum up the conducted considerations. 
1. The peculiarity of external membrane of plant cells must lead to generation of chaotic 
ultrasound splashes by ion currents through it. Their frequencies are, most probably, in the 
interval 0.1 ÷ 1 MHz with intensity of tenth parts of W/cm2 and induced additional pressure of 
the order of 1 Pa per cell. 
2. This order of frequencies value follows such phenomena: 1). Ion diffusion through membrane; 
2). Degassing of lifting water: 3). Resonances of xilem and phloem vessels as acoustoguides; 4). 
Distribution of electric potential along liquid currents. Two last estimations narrow the interval 
of frequencies in xilem to 150÷200 kHz. 
3. Power of such generated USR seems sufficient for explanation of cyclosis, xilem and phloem 
transport. It explains mechanisms of external acoustical influence: acceleration of growth at 
small intensity and destruction at big one. 
4. The existence of acoustical flows explains some electrophysiological phenomena in trees. 
   All it requires serious investigation of acoustical phenomena in plants by joined examinations 
of biologists and physicists. 
  
APPENDIX  
    Our main statement that changing of charges density on biological membranes in the 
processes of methabolism generates acoustical (ultrasound) waves, require more general 
deduction. It can be described in such form.  
    Changes of Hookean forces at membrane pressing on the depth dh is dp = Ydh/h and the 
complete mechanical pressure acting on the membrane

     The attractive electrical forces withstanding them are expressed by the pressure

where ε is the dielectric susceptibility of membrane substance, its changing at pressing can be 
ignored. 
      The potential of membrane can be presented as 
U(t) = U + ∆U(t),                                                                                                 (A.3) 
where U ≈ 0.1 V is the mean constant part and ∆U(t) < U is a variable part. The depth of 
membrane is correspondingly represented as 
h(t) = h0 – ∆h0 – x(t),                                                                                        (A.4)    
here h0 is the thickness of membrane without charges on it, ∆h0 is the grip at potential U and x(t) 
is the quick variation of thickness connected with ∆U(t). 
    Equating of (A.1) and (A.2) with taking into account the approximation ln(1 + ξ) ≈ ξ at ξ<<1

      This relation visually shows that each change of potential, connected with ion currents, ion 
absorption from exterior, molecules ionization or recombination on membranes, will generate 
acoustical vibrations (some close considerations are given in [34]). Note that even this form 
proves that at these processes along with the main frequency its second harmonics would be 
generated. More detail consideration would show existence of higher harmonics also.

Abstract 

Electron  correlation  effects  are  often  invoked  as  possible  candidates  to  explain 

differences  observed  between  experimental  and  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  Compton  profiles.  The 

shape  as  well  as  the  magnitude  of these differences can be very different, depending on  the 

systems investigated. In order to illustrate this, simple analytical wave functions (WFs) for 2-

electrons systems are proposed, which are correlated though radial and/or angular correlation 

factors. The “near-exact” densities obtained give us the opportunity to illustrate the dilemma 

that  occurs  when  modeling  momentum  densities  from  Kohn-Sham  (KS)  orbitals.  Ab  initio 

studies follow for the analysis of correlation mechanisms in isolated ionic systems. opposite 

trends  observed  for  experimental  deviations  to  HF  Compton  profiles  are  then  qualitatively 

explained through empirical models.  

 
Keywords: 2-electrons systems, radial correlation, angular correlation, momentum space,

I. Introduction 

X-rays scattering experiments often reveal systematic deviations to HF calculations of 

impulse  Compton  profiles1.  Let  denote  by  (cid:1)JExp(q,u)    the  experimental  deviation  to  the  HF 

profile, i.e. (cid:1)JExp(q,u)  = JExp(q,u) - JHF(q,u), where q stands for the momentum variable and u 

is the direction of observation. In the case of cubic ionic crystals, the difference (cid:1)JExp(q,u) is 

mainly isotropic2, so that dependence on u can be dropped in first approximation: (cid:1)JExp(q,u) (cid:2) 

(cid:1)JExp(q). The experimental deviation (cid:1)JExp(q) might further show opposite trends, depending 

on materials studied. For example, it is observed (cid:1)JExp(0) < 0 in the case of LiH and (cid:1)JExp(0) 

>  0  for  MgO2.  Among  various  experimental  effects,  correlation  effects  are  often  invoked  to 

explain these discrepancies. How can the same physical effect explain two opposite trends for 

(cid:1)JExp(q) ?  

To  answer  this  question,  we  first  refined  empirical  correlation  (i.e.  correlated  –  HF) 

Compton profiles straightforwardly on (cid:1)JExp. Despite a nice agreement, refined parameters do 

not permit to get a clear picture of mechanisms involved2 and can further be misleading, since 

other  experimental  effects  occur1(cid:1)3.  We  have  therefore  recently  performed  ab  initio 

calculations3  on  clusters,  which  accredited  the  possibility  for  correlation  as  responsible  for 

both  opposite  effects.  Meanwhile,  we  try  to  propose  a  simple  model  to  interpret  correlation 

mechanisms  in  momentum  space.  To  this  aim,  we  cast  intra-atomic  correlation  into  two 

mechanisms,  i.e.  angular  and  radial  correlation  effects.  These  effects  have  been  widely 

studied  and  explained  in  terms  of  contributions  to  the  correlation  energy  (see  for  example 

reference  19  and  references  therein).  However,  only  few studies (like that of Meyer, Müller 

and Schweig4) do report analyses of correlation effects on observable quantities. All the more, 

possible consequences of different correlation mechanisms have never been analyzed, to our 

 

2

knowledge,  for the interpretation of  opposite  trends observed for the experimental deviation 

(cid:1)JExp.  

We first compare angularly versus radially correlated distributions (section II) of some 

2-electrons  systems.  Since  correlated  charge  densities  approach  exact  ones,  we  can  analyze 

“near-exact”  KS  orbitals  in  momentum  space  (section  III).  Configuration  interaction  (CI) 

calculations on isolated ions then confirm that correlation in valence shells leads to the most 

visible part of deformations (section IV). They further accredit the assumption of correlation 

as  responsible  for  the  observed  deviation  to  HF  profiles.  Finally,  an  empirical  model  where 

anions are artificially confined near the nucleus suggests that an enhanced angular correlation 

mechanism  (section  V)  might  be  responsible  for  the  trend  observed  for  LiH  correlation 

profiles.    

mechanisms     

II. 2-electrons  systems 

:  radial  versus  angular  correlation 

The  helium  problem  became  a  whole  challenge  already  at  the  early  days  of  the 

quantum theory: scientists were trying to convince of the pertinence of Schrödinger equation 

for studying atomic systems. In 1928, Hylleraas5 determined a WF so accurate that his method 

inspired  many  other  studies  like  James  and  Coolidge’s  one  for  H2

analyzed  the  correlated  hamiltonian

  and  shown  that  the  divergence  at  the 

coalescence point (

) brings a cusp in the exact WF, which must in turn exhibit a linear 

(cid:2)r

  dependence  near 

(cid:2)r

.  It  is  well  known  since  Hylleraas  work  that  introducing  the 

variable 

12r

  in  the  WF  ensures  a  fast  convergence  of  the  correlation  energy.  Following  this 

idea,  a  formidable  number  of  accurate  analytical  WFs  have  been  then  suggested  so  that  is 

rather  challenging  to  report  all the corresponding studies. The reader interested may consult 

 

3

references  8,9,10,11,12  and  references  therein.  Note  that  Hylleraas-like  WFs  are  still  widely 

used13,14, notably in the field of atomic physics.  

Unfortunately,  such  functions  become  rapidly  prohibitive  as  the  number  of  electron 

increases.  All  the  more,  the  analytical  evaluation  of  the  subsequent  electron  distributions  in 

momentum  space  clearly  makes  the  use  of  Hylleraas-like  WFs  a  torment.  The  compromise 

adopted  here  bypasses  this  difficulty:  it  relies  on  a  partial  separation  of  angular  and  radial 

effects, as suggested when developing the term

the  electronic  cloud  experiences  a  screening  of  the  nucleus  due  to  the  internal  part,  which 

mechanism  invokes  radial  correlation.  In  the  case  of  a  low  nuclear  charge  ion  (i.e.  H-),  the 

screening is proportionally more important. Following terms further imply angular correlation 

through the inter-particle angle (cid:1)12.  

In order to reflect both radial and angular effects while keeping a separable character, 

the trial WF chosen is

that is, terms like  (cid:1)

This approach is further less efficient than the Hylleraas-like. However, the lack of singularity

 greatly simplifies the analytical calculation of Compton profiles. The uncorrelated

HF reference WF is chosen as an optimized triple-zeta one, so that in the following, all say 

“correlation quantities” refer to the difference correlated – HF. 

The trial WF (2) reveals all the more to be accurate for ions of lower nuclear charge 

(like  H-),  for  which  the  mutual  screening  of  electrons  is  proportionally  more  important. 

Values of correlation energies (cid:2) obtained are scheduled in table 1. The WF (2) can be reduced 

to  a  function  mainly  “angularly”  correlated  by  imposing  the  contraints

Conversely, angular correlation is switched off by putting

 in (2). Resulting WFs 

are  optimized  separately,  resulting  in  correlation  energies,  which  are  obviously  not  fully 

independent.  In  table  1,  we  observe  that  the  energy  of  radial  correlation  is  proportionally 

more  important  for  the  lower  nuclear  charge  ion.  Conversely,  angular  correlation  energy 

seems to increase with Z (while Z < 3). For Z > 2, the model WF clearly becomes insufficient 

for describing the angular correlation due to the low angular expansion of the trial WF. Let us 

nevertheless  point  out  that  whereas  exact  correlation  energies  remain  almost  constant  (table 

1), the magnitudes of correlation densities drastically decrease as the nucleus charge increases 

(figure 1): this conclusion holds for ions of Z > 2. The correlation charge densities reported on 

are radial quantities (i.e. multiplied by 

4 r(cid:1)

2

), which allows for an appreciation of correlation 

effects  at  large  values  of  r.  All  curves  integrate  to  zero,  since  they  are  defined  as  the 

difference between two normalized distributions. We have checked that variational densities 

compare well with ab initio ones, calculated in very extended basis sets: correlation densities 

of  H-  obtained  from  the  trial  WF  (2)  revealed  to  be  quasi-identical  to  those  delivered  by 

Gaussian9415 (CI – HF calculation within AUG-cc-pV5Z basis-set16). 

We  also  compare  angularly,  radially  and  globally  optimized  correlation  densities  for 

H-  and  He.  Subsequent  deformations  are  reported  on  figure  1  for  the  charge  density  (left 

column)  and  the  Compton  profiles  (right  column).  Note  that  the  magnitudes  of  the 

 

5

deformations  are  very  sharp  in  P-space  for  the  H-  diffuse  ion.  The  larger  magnitudes  are 

associated  to  lower  nuclear  charge  ions,  which  suggests  the  most  visible  correlation 

deformations  shall  more  generally  be  associated  to  valence  electrons.  The  possibility  for 

angular correlation alone allows the electron cloud to get closer to the nucleus, while slightly 

shifting the Compton profile towards higher momenta. The subsequent correlation profile is 

thus negative at zero momentum ((cid:1)JCorr,Ang(0) < 0), which feature is for instance observed in 

the case of LiH. Radial correlation alone widens the electron distributions. However, we can 

point out that deformations in P-space are systematically positive at large q, consistently with 

the  Virial  theorem,  which  implies  that  correlation  increases  the  kinetic  energy.  Besides,  we 

observed in the case of H- that correlation effects are more pronounced on Compton profiles 

than on form factors: maximum relative deviations being respectively of about 20% and 5% 

(not reported). The magnitudes of the deformations become however similar for neutral and 

positive species (<1%).  

The  observed  deformations  reflect  the  error  associated  with  the  mean  field 

approximation:  for  instance,  one  can  conclude  that  the  HF  approximation  overestimates 

electron distributions near  x , where x = r, q. This interpretation, which is just so fine, holds 

for the momentum density of light 2-electrons systems but is not straightforwardly extensible 

to heavier ions.  

III.  Momentum space: KS, CI and others 

Let  us  shortly  deviate  from  our  initial  concern  to  examine  KS  orbital  in  momentum 

space.  The  momentum  density  is  defined  as

thereby

(1RDM) or at least an N-representable one. The momentum density can subsequently not be 

straightforwardly  derived  from  a  KS  determinant,  except  for  practical  reasons.  Rather,  it 

 

6

should  be  defined  as  a  functional  of  the  density,  like  any  other  electronic  property.  It  is 

therefore  interesting  to  understand  the  error  inherent  to  momentum  distributions  obtained 

from KS orbitals, i.e. in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). As pointed out by 

Savin  during  a  recent  intimate  workshop17:  it  is  necessary  to  distinguish  between  the  “true” 

DFT from the “zoology” inherent to the choice of appropriate functionals before concluding 

on the potential of DFT for momentum space.  

Therefore, we take advantage of dealing with 2-electrons systems to define the unique 

KS orbital as 

(cid:2)

, in the same way than Qian and Sahni did while analyzing 

properties of the Hooke’s atom18. Considering the reference correlated density 

(cid:1) (cid:2)r(cid:1)

 obtained 

from  (2)  as  the  exact  one,  we  calculate  numerically  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  KS  orbital 

(cid:1) ),  from  which  is  obtained  the  KS  momentum  density:

.  The 

correlated,  HF  and  KS  radial  momentum  densities  of  H-  are  compared  on  figure  2.  It  is 

striking that  n

 is closer to

 than

. The same observation holds for He (not 

reported).  We  are  then  tempted  to  conclude  that  KS  orbitals  may  lead  to  more  accurate 

momentum densities than HF ones, i.e. that KS orbitals contain part of the correlation effects. 

However,  the  corresponding  increase  of  the  kinetic  energy  is  only  0.008  u.a.  (KS  –  HF), 

which must be compared to the exact (0.039 u.a.) or the present one (0.035 u.a. from WF 2– 

HF),  revealing  thereby  a  lack  of  correlation-induced  momentum  transfer.  Indeed,  while 

1RDMs derived from single determinants write as a finite sum of orbital products (only 1 in 

the present case), exact 1RDMs require a sum of infinite terms, revealing strong connections 

between r and r’ variables. 

This point can be easily understood through a simple example: the harmonium atom.  

The harmonium atom is a fictive system of 2 fermions trapped in a harmonic potential while 

repelling each other through the Hooke’s law. This system has been proposed by Davidson19 

and  later  reused  by  Thakkar20  in  order  to  illustrate  correspondences  between  the  various 

 

7

electron distributions. Such a system is exactly solvable, which allows us to compare exact, 

HF  and  KS  density  matrices,  respectively  denoted  by

 Besides,  we  have  checked  that  ab  initio  calculations  resulted  in  more  accurate  KS 

than HF momentum densities in the case of H-, whereas the KS momentum density obtained 

for  He  revealed  much  less  accurate  than  the  HF  one  (using  Becke’s  88  functional  for 

exchange21  and  Perdew/Wang’s  91  correlation  functional22).  This  obviously  recommends 

being cautious while interpreting KS orbitals in momentum space, especially when looking at 

correlation effects.

IV. Valence  versus  global  correlation  effects  in  isolated  ionic

 requires very extended basis-sets (BSs),

sensitive  to  the  choice  of  the  BS4:  we  observed  that  magnitudes  of  correlation  densities 

estimated from cc-pVTZ and cc-pV6Z basis sets16 can vary of a factor 3 in the case of light 

ions.  We  report  correlation  effects  on  radial  densities  on  figure  3  and  4  (R  and  P-space, 

respectively) for a closed-shell negative ion (F-). The calculation was performed at CISD/cc-

pV5Z level16: CISD stands for CI with all single and double excitations. This was achieved by 

interpreting in momentum space the 1RDM:

: each resulting contribution is shown on figure 3 and 4 (in both R and P-

space,  respectively).  As  suggested  from  2-electrons  calculations,  almost  all  the  visible 

deformations arise due to valence electrons. It thus allows for modeling correlation effects in 

valence shells only in first approximation. The observed deformations are further qualitatively 

similar to that of 2- or 10-electron systems and contribute up to 2.6% of the global MD but 

this value is probably widely underestimated (they indeed reach 18% in the case of H-), due to 

the limited basis-set we used.  

The  comparison  of  correlation  momentum  densities  of  He,  Ne  and  F-,  calculated  at 

CISD/cc-pV5Z  level,  has  shown  that  correlation  effects  increase  with  both  the  number  of 

electrons and the level of ionicity (not reported). This suggests that ionic crystals be potential 

candidates  for  the  observation  of  electron  correlation  effects  in  P-space.  Besides,  we  have 

noticed  that  the  shapes  of  correlation  profiles  of  2  and  10-electron  systems  exhibit  some 

qualitative  resemblance  with  that  both  theoretically  and  experimentally  observed  for  MgO 

crystals2,3.  

Conversely,  correlation  in  4-electron  systems  yields  much  larger  magnitudes  for  the 

correlation-induced deformations4, together with the property (cid:2)JCorr(0) < 0. For such systems, 

the usual proximity of the levels 2s/2p enhances the angular correlation character.

V. Interpretation  of  opposite  trends  obtained  for  experimental 

deviations to Compton profiles of some ionic compounds 

We  have  recently  shown  that  a  cluster-based  calculation,  followed  by  an  appropriate 

pseudo-atomic  partition  of  the  1RDM  (cluster  partitioning  method  or  CPM),  enables  an 

accurate  evaluation  of  observable  quantities3,23.  The  method  has  been  tested  for  generic 

materials like insulators (LiH, MgO), a semiconductor (Si) and a simple molecular crystal (Ice 

Ih). The main point is that the method is transparent in both R and P-spaces, which allows for 

a  comparison  between  experimental  and  theoretical  electron  distributions  in  both  spaces 

simultaneously. Restricting calculations to small clusters further allowed for a fair description 

of  local  correlation  effects  in  ionic  compounds  on  both  Compton  profiles  and  structure 

factors.  In  each  case,  correlation  effects  are  mainly  associated  to  the  anions.  Subsequent 

correlation profiles show a qualitative agreement with the observed experimental trends, that 

is, (cid:2)JCorr(0) < 0 for LiH and (cid:2)JCorr (0) > 0 for MgO.  

So far, so good, but we did not get a clear picture of mechanisms involved. Therefore, 

assuming  that  mainly  local  correlation  mechanisms  are  involved,  we  propose  a  simple  2-

electrons model where both angular and radial correlation mechanisms compete. The nuclear 

charge  of  the  ionic  system  is  Z  =  1.  We  make  use  of  the  former  trial  WF  (2),  while  the 

uncorrelated reference wave function remains the triple-zeta one. The difference with isolated 

systems  studied  in  section  II  is  that  electrons  now  experience  an  effective  central  potential

eff

the  Pauli  repulsion  of  surrounding  pair  of  valence  electrons  and,  in  turn,  confines  electrons 

more or less close to the nucleus. Optimizing both correlated and uncorrelated wave functions 

enables an analytical evaluation of the correlation Compton profile, as reported on figure 5 for 

various values of k (respectively k = 0.001, 0.005 and 0.010 a.u.). Increasing ion confinement 

in crystal affects the trend of correlation profiles, notably near q = 0, i.e. it reduces the radial 

 

10

correlation mechanism. The case k = 0.010 a.u. renders a correlation profile very close to that 

obtained  from  an  ab  initio  calculation  on  a  Li1H6  cluster  (QCISD  –  HF  calculation  in  an 

extended  BS3),  after  averaging  the  periphery  anion  contributions.  The  Li1H6  cluster  was 

embedded  in  a  Madelung  field  for  ensuring  electrical  neutrality.  The  two  former  curves  are 

further  in  qualitative  agreement  with  the  experimental  deviation  observed  for  LiH  (with  the 

correct  limit  (cid:2)JCorr(0)  <  0),  regardless  of  the  magnitudes.  These  observations  accredit  the 

assumption  of  a  preferred  angular  correlation  mechanism  for  LiH.  Since  angular  correlation 

enables electrons to get closer to the anionic nucleus, it reduces the size of the anion, which is 

consistent with the often-mentioned HF overestimation of anionic radii in LiH24. On the other 

hand, smaller values of k render model correlation profiles resembling these of free 2- or 10-

electrons  systems,  as  well  as  this  obtained  from  a  cluster  calculation  on  MgO3.  We  thus 

conclude that opposite trends observed for experimental deviations to HF Compton profiles of 

ionic compounds can result from different strengths of confinement of the embedded anion. 

The  theoretical  correlation  profile  of  LiH  has  a  much  lower  magnitude  than  the 

experimental  deviation,  which  must  necessary  have  consequences  on  kinetic  energies.  Note 

that the transfer of one electron from Li to H forms a paired couple, the correlation energy of 

which wholly participate to the cohesion mechanism. The experimental cohesion energy was 

estimated25 to 0.18 a.u. vs. 0.13 a.u. from HF calculation. The difference, 0.05 a.u., is close to 

the  usually  expected  correlation  energy  for  an  isolated  single  pair19  ((cid:3)  -  0.04  a.u.).  For 

instance,  the  increase  of  kinetic  energies  due  to  correlation  and  involving  the  anion  alone 

(Mulliken  approximation)  was  estimated  to  0.04  a.u.  from  the  Li1H6  calculation,  after 

averaging  anionic  kinetic  energies.  This  value  is  consistent  with  the  expected  one  (which 

should  not  exceed  0.05  a.u.,  through  the  Virial  theorem),  while  the  experimental  deviation 

widely overestimates the correlation kinetic energy3. 

 

11

Conversely,  LiH  crystal  might  be  seen  as  an  assembly  of  Li-  anions  stabilized  by  an 

octahedral cage of protons. As already mentioned, correlation effects are well pronounced for 

4-electron  systems  and  yields  large  magnitude  for  correlation  densities;  they  further  deliver 

shapes of correlation profiles similar to that observed for LiH (with the property (cid:2)JCorr(0) < 0, 

see reference 4. 

VI. Conclusion 

Simple  analytical  WFs  allow  for  an  analytic  evaluation  of  correlation  effects  on 

observable  quantities  for  2-electrons  systems.  The  choice  we  made  that  consists  of  a 

separation, in a certain extent, of radial and angular effects enables to illustrate the evolution 

of correlation mechanisms when the nuclear charge increases. Radial correlation mechanism 

is  preponderant  for  low  Z  ions.  The  error  inherent  to  mean  field  approximations  is  further 

characterized  in  a  very  simple  manner  in  both  spaces  simultaneously.  Two-electron 

correlation effects on momentum densities can be further partly recovered by using near-exact 

KS  orbitals.  The  KS  momentum  density  does  otherwise  not  systematically  improve  the  HF 

one when using standard functionals. Ab initio calculations confirm that mainly valence-shells 

correlation  appreciably  affects  the  1-electron  distributions,  which  allows  for  modeling 

correlation effects in the valence shell only as a first approximation. Therefore, we modeled 

anions  in  crystals  like  an  effective  2-electrons  system  experiencing  a  confinement  potential, 

which  mimics  the  Pauli  repulsion  of  surrounding  paired  electrons.  The  resulting  correlation 

profile  obtained  is  in  very  close  agreement  with  previous  results  obtained  from  ab  initio 

calculations  performed  on  small  cluster3.  We  concluded  that  opposite  trends  observed  for 

experimental  deviations  to  HF  Compton  profiles  of  ionic  crystals  can  be  interpreted  as 

resulting from different strengths of confinement of the embedded anion.

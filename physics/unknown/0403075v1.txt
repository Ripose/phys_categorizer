Abstract.

We  introduce  a  new  statistical  tool  (the  TP-statistic and TE-statistic) designed specifically to
compare the behavior of the sample tail of distributions with power-law and exponential tails as
a  function  of  the  lower  threshold  u.  One  important  property  of  these  statistics  is  that  they
converge to zero for power laws or for exponentials correspondingly, regardless of the value of
the exponent or of the form parameter. This is particularly useful for testing the structure of a
distribution (power law or not, exponential or not) independently of the possibility of quantifying
the  values  of  the  parameters.  We  apply  these  statistics  to  the  distribution  of  returns  of  one
century of daily data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over one year of 5-minutes data
of the Nasdaq Composite index. Our analysis confirms previous works showing the tendency for
the tails to resemble more and more a power law for the highest quantiles but we can detect clear
deviations  that  suggest  that  the  structure  of  the  tails  of  the  distributions  of  returns  is  more
complex than usually assumed; it is clearly more complex that just a power law.

Key words: distribution of financial returns, power law distribution, Pareto law, exponential
distribution, non-parametric statistics, deviation from standard law

1-Introduction

   The distribution of returns is one of the most basic characteristics of the stock markets and
many papers have been devoted to it. One could summarize the present situation by saying that a
large number of papers document tails of the probability distribution function (PDF) of returns
which are heavier than a Gaussian tail and heavier than an exponential tail and are rather well
approximated by a power law with exponent in the range 2.5-3.5, such that the existence of the
third  (skewness)  and  the  fourth  (kurtosis)  moments  is  questionable.  The  fat-tail  nature  of  the
PDF is best observed for intra-day time scales (minutes) [1-4]. A few works including two recent
papers [5,6] of the present authors (with Y. Malevergne) propose an alternative parameterization
in terms of stretched exponentials, based on statistical tests suggesting that the exponent of the
power law tail does not seem stable in the tail of the PDFs of datasets of medium size (20000
values) which are typical of standard financial applications. We refer to [1-4] for evidence of
power  law  tails  in  high  frequency  data  and  [5,6]  for  a  review  and  discussion  of  alternative
models of the PDFs of financial returns.

One important origin behind the controversy on the nature of the tail of PDFs of financial returns
stems  from  the  use  of  different  parts  (u,∞)  of  the  tails  1-F(x) (F(x)  being  the  cumulative
distribution  function).  Usually,  in  the  lower  part  of  the  quantile  range,  one  observes  a  slow
decreasing  tail  whereas,  at  the  extreme  part  of  the  quantile  range,  the  decay  rate  of  the  tail
becomes considerably faster. Thus, the answer to the question “what is the tail of the observed
distribution?”  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the  lower  threshold  u  of  the  data  used  in  fitting
procedures.  For  instance,  works  documenting  the  relevance  of  stable  Levy  laws  use  the  full
sample range [7-9] while discrepancies appear when constraining the analyses to different tail
ranges. Malevergne et al. [5,6] show in particular that the apparent power law exponent of the
Pareto  increases  with  the  quantiles  and  its  growth  does  not  seem  exhausted  for  the  highest
quantiles  of  three  out  of  the  four  tail  distributions  investigated.  The  Boston  group  [1,2]
circumvents  this  difficulty  by  combining  high-frequency  data  for  thousands  of  companies  by
normalizing each data set by its standard deviation, thus introducing in this way an effect not
completely  understood.  Or  they  fit  individually  the  high-frequency  PDFs  of  thousands  of
companies by a power law and find that most exponents lie in the range 2-4. It is clear that such
parametric fits can only address the question of what is the average representation of the tail of
PDF (in some range pre-defined rather arbitrarily) by a power law but do not test in details the
adequacy of this model, especially as a function of the depth (quantile) in the tail of the PDFs.

Here, we suggest a new statistical tool (that we call T-statistic) designed specifically to describe
the behavior of the sample tail as compared with power-like and exponential tails as a function
of the lower threshold u. Specifically, we propose two statistics:  TP(u) and TE(u). The former
(respectively latter) is asymptotically small (i.e. converges to zero as the sample size n tends to
infinity)  for  the  power  tail  described  by  the  Pareto  distribution:  1-F(x)  =  (u/x)b  ;  x≥≥≥≥u with
arbitrary power index b (respectively  for the exponential tail 1-F(x)=exp(-(x-u)/d); x≥≥≥≥u with
an arbitrary form parameter d). At the same time, TP(u) (respectively TE(u)) deviates from zero
for  distributions  differing  from  the  target  one,  i.e.  the  Pareto  distribution  (respectively  the
exponential distribution). Thus, we can use the TP-statistic in order to expose in a very clear,
visual and understandable way the deviations of a given sample from the Pareto distribution with
arbitrary power index b (respectively the exponential distribution with arbitrary form parameter
d).  Of  course,  the  statistical  scatter  of  the TP and TE  statistics  should  and  will  be  taken  into
account.

Thus,  instead  of  answering  the  question  “what  does  the  sample  tail  look  like:  power-like  or
exponential-like?”  we  answer  with  the  help  of  TP-  and  TE-statistics  to  a  rather  different
question: “what part  of the extreme tail looks  power-like  (or,  exponential-like)?”  Of  course,
negative answers to both questions are possible.
   We illustrate our introduced  TP- and  TE-statistics on two datasets previously studied in [5,6]:
the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) daily log-returns over the twentieth century, and the
Nasdaq  Composite  index  (ND)  5-minutes  log-returns  over  one  year  from  April  1997  to  May
1998 obtained from Bloomberg (for positive and negative returns separately). Our T-statistics
shows that all 4 samples tails as functions of the lower threshold u behave similarly: in the bulk
of the samples, they are close to an exponential distribution while, at the extreme range, they
approach a power-like decay. TP- and TE-statistics provide the possibility of locating (of course
with some statistical uncertainty) the value of the “cross-over” or “change-of-regime” between
these two limiting behaviors for each corresponding sample. This shows that the risk measures
such as VaR (value-at-risk) and expected shortfall cannot be estimated in a standard way with
the  same  distributional  model  for  all  quantile  or  confidence  levels.  This  has  important
consequences for risk assessment and management. Our TP- and TE-statistics also show that,
while the power law model becomes better than the exponential model in the tails, there exists
detectable deviations as a function of the lower thresholds, even for the largest quantiles. Our
analysis  seems  to  confirm  that  the  power  law  tail  is  not  fully  sufficient  to  model  in  full  the
asymptotic tails of the distributions of financial returns in datasets of about 20000 data points,
whose  sizes  are  significant  compared  with  those  used  routinely  in  investment  and  portfolio
analysis.

Section  2  introduces  the TP-statistics and derives its properties. Section 3 introduces the TE-
statistics and derives its properties. Section 4 presents the application of the TP- and TE-statistics
to the DJIA and ND data sets. Section 5 concludes.

2- TP-statistic and its properties
Consider the Pareto distribution F(x), conditioned on the semi-axis x ≥ u :

(1) 

F(x) = 1 – (u/x)b , x ≥ u, b > 0,

where  u is a lower threshold, and b is the power index of the distribution. Let us consider a
finite sample x1,…, xn. In [15], the following statistic TP = TP(x1,…, xn) was suggested such
that, asymptotically for large n, TP would be close to zero and, at the same time, would
deviate from zero for samples whose distribution deviates from eq.(1). This statistic is based
on the first two normalized statistical log-moments of the distribution (1). Using the symbol E
for the mathematical expectation, we have

(2)     

E1 ≡ E log(X/u) =    ∫

 log(x/u) dF(x) = 1/b ;

∞

u

∞

u

(3)      

E2 ≡  E log2(X/u) =    ∫

 log2(x/u) dF(x) =  2/b2.

Thus, if we choose

TP = (1/n) ∑

n

=
k 1

 log(xk/u) )2 – (0.5/n)  ∑

 log2(xk/u),

n

=
k 1

then according to the Law of Large Numbers and equations (2)-(3), the statistic TP tends to
zero as n →∞  . In order to evaluate the standard deviation std(TP) of the statistic TP,  we
rewrite the expression for TP in the form:

(4) 

TP = (1/n) ∑

n

=
k 1

[log(xk/u) -E1] + E1)2 – (0.5/n)  ∑

[log2(xk/u)- E2] - 0.5E2,

n

=
k 1

where E1, E2 are the expectations of log(xk/u) and log2(xk/u) respectively (for Pareto samples,
E1, = 1/b  and E2 =2/b2 as given in expressions (2) and (3)). Both sums in eq.(4) are of the
order n -0.5 :

                ε1 =1/n ∑

[log(xk/u) –E1] ∝ n -0.5 ; ε2 =1/n ∑

[log2(xk/u) -2/b2] ∝ n -0.5

n

=
k 1

n

=
k 1

Thus, if n is large enough, we can expand TP in eq.(4) into Taylor series up to terms of the
order n -0.5  in the neighborhood of E1 and E2 respectively:

(5)                                       TP ≅ (E2

1 -0.5E2)+2E1ε1 –0.5 ε2 .

This provides an estimation of std(TP) by the standard deviation of the sum:

(6) 

2E1ε1 –0.5 ε2 = (2 E1 /n) ∑

[log(xk/u) -E1] – (0.5/n)∑

[log2(xk/u)- E2] =

n

=
k 1

                                    = (0.5 E2 - 2 E2

[2 E1 log(xk/u) – 0.5 log2(xk/u)].

n

=
k 1

n

1) +(1/n) ∑

=
k 1

The standard deviation of the last sum in (6) can be estimated by

 (7)                                     n -0.5 std[2 E1 log(xk/u) – 0.5 log2(xk/u)],

and  the  standard  deviation  std  of  the  term  in  the  bracket  in  eq.(7)  is  estimated  through  its
sampled  value  [2  E1  log(xk/u)  –  0.5  log2(xk/u)].  Equation  (6)  then  provides  an  estimate  of
std(TP) if we replace E1 by its sample analog:
                                                      (1 /n) ∑

log(xk/u).

n

=
k 1

3- TE-statistic and its properties
Let us consider the exponential distribution, conditioned to the semi-axis x ≥ u :

(8)            F(x) = 1 – exp( -(x-u)/d ),  x ≥ u,

 d > 0,

where  u is a lower threshold, and d is the form parameter (scale parameter) of the distribution.
Let us consider a finite sample x1,…, xn. It is desirable to construct a statistic TE = TE(x1,…,
xn)  such  that,  asymptotically  for  large  n, TE  would  be  close  to  zero  and,  at  the  same  time,
would deviate from zero for samples whose distribution deviates from eq.(8). Let us construct
such  statistic  based  on  the  first  two  normalized  statistical  (shifted)  log-moments  of  the
distribution (8). Using again the symbol E for the mathematical expectation, we have

(9)     

E log(X/u -1) =    ∫

 log(x/u -1) dF(x) = log(d/u) -C ,

∞

u

where C  is the Euler constant: C = 0.577215… .

(10)      E log2(X/u -1) =    ∫

 log2(x/u -1) dF(x) =  (  log(d/u) -C  )2 +π2/6.

Thus, if we choose

(11)                TE = 1/n ∑

 log2(xk/u -1)  – (1/n  ∑

 log(xk/u -1) )2 - π2/6,

n

=
k 1

∞

u

n

=
k 1

then according to the Law of Large Numbers and equations (9)-(10), the statistic TE tends to
zero  as  n →∞ . In order to evaluate the standard deviation std(TE)  of the statistic TE,  w e
rewrite (11) in the form:

(12)     

 TE = π2/6  + 1/n∑

n

=
k 1

[ (  log(xk/u-1) –E log(X/u -1)]2 .

This provides an estimation of std(TE) by the standard deviation of the sum:

(13)                                               1/n∑

[ (  log(xk/u-1) –E log(X/u -1)]2 ,

n

=
k 1

which can be easily performed.

4- Application of the TP- and TE-statistics to the DJIA and ND data sets

This  section  presents  a  series  of  figures  plotting  the TP-statistic TP(u)  and  the  TE-statistic
TE(u)  as a function of the lower threshold u for returns of the DJIA at the daily time-scale
and for the ND at the 5-minute time-scale.

In  order  to  appreciate  the  information  contained  in  these  plots,  it  is  useful  to  test  the
corresponding statistics for a pure Pareto sample and for a pure exponential sample. Fig.1a
shows the TP-statistic TP(u)   as a function of the lower threshold u, applied to a simulated
Pareto  sample  of  size  n=20000  with  power  index  b =  3  generated  with  u=1  as  defined  in
Eq.(1). Fig.1b shows the TE-statistic TE(u) for this pure power law.  Fig.2a shows the TP-
statistic  TP(u)  applied  to  a  simulated  exponential  sample  of  size  n=20000  with  form
parameter d = 4 generated with u=1 as defined in Eq.(8). Fig.2b shows the TE-statistic TE(u)
for this pure exponential law.

Fig.3  shows  the  TP-statistic  TP(u) and the TE-statistic  TE(u)    as  a  function  of  the  lower
threshold u for positive returns of the DJIA at the daily time-scale. The TP(u)  statistic shows
clearly  a  tendency  for  a  convergence  towards  a  power  law  behavior,  but  statistically
significant departures still remain up to the largest available thresholds. The TE(u)  statistic
can  not  exclude  the  exponential  model  for  lower  thresholds  above  3%  but  its  standard
deviations are very large and this statistic thus lacks power of discrimination.

Fig.4 shows the TP-statistic TP(u) (a) and the TE-statistic TE(u)  as a function of the lower
threshold u for negative returns of the DJIA at the daily time-scale.  The TP(u)  statistic shows
a convergence towards a power law behavior which is accepted only for the largest available
threshold  u>4%.  The  TE(u)  statistic  can  not  exclude  the  exponential  model  for  lower
thresholds above 3%  but its standard deviations are very large and this statistic thus lacks
power of discrimination.

Fig.5 shows the TP-statistic TP(u) (a) and the TE-statistic TE(u)  as a function of the lower
threshold u for positive returns of the ND at the 5-minutes time-scale.  The TP(u) statistic
shows a convergence towards a power law behavior over an intermediate range 1% < u < 3%
but shows a distinct departure for a power law further deep in the tail for u>3%. The TE(u)
statistic  clearly  excludes  the  exponential  model  for  all  lower  thresholds  and  shows  a  non-
monotonous behavior of the tail, confirming the observation of the  TP(u)  statistic.

Fig.6 shows the TP-statistic TP(u) (a) and the TE-statistic TE(u)  as a function of the lower
threshold u  for negative returns of the ND at the 5-minutes time-scale.  The TP(u) statistic
shows  a  clear  convergence  towards  a  power  law  behavior  which  becomes  approximately
stable for 0.15% < u. A slight departure from the pure power law behavior can be observed
for  the  largest  thresholds.  The  TE(u)  statistic  can  not  exclude  the  exponential  model  for
almost all lower thresholds  but its standard deviations are very large and this statistic thus
lacks power of discrimination.

5- Concluding remarks

These analyses complement those presented in [5,6]: they confirm the tendency for the tails to
resemble  more  and  more  a  power  law  for  the  highest  quantiles  but  we  can  detect  clear
deviations that suggest that the structure of the tails of the distributions of returns is more
complex than usually assumed; it is clearly more complex that just a power law. The nature of
the  real  tail  of  the  PDF  of  financial  returns  has  not  been  settled  here:  our  conservative
conclusion  is  that,  while  the  power  law  may  present  an  approximate  model,  it  may  be
inaccurate  to  extrapolate  such  a  model  beyond  the  range  of  observed  returns.    Being

inaccurate,  it  may  be  inappropriate  to  use  for  risk  assessment  purposes  because  the
unobserved  tail  may  be  thinner  or  fatter  than  estimated  in  the  finite  available  range.
Extrapolations are dangerous in view of the distinct deviations from the reference power law
or exponential models. We believe in particular that the existence of conditional dependencies
for the largest returns (see [10-14] and references therein) may impact significantly on the tail
structure  for  the  highest  quantiles  which  may  thus  take  a  different  asymptotic  form  than
determined in the empirical range. Such intermittent dependences may perhaps be in part at
the origin of the complexity of the distribution of financial returns. Such a conclusion has
been clearly shown to describe the distributions of drawdowns, i.e., runs of returns from top to
bottom prices, which are characterized by two regimes [12,14]: an approximate exponential
body and tails much more heavy-tailed that the extrapolation of the exponential law (called
“outliers” or “kings”).

Fig.  4:    TP-statistic TP(u) (a) and the TE-statistic  TE(u)    (b)  as  a  function  of  the  lower
threshold u  for  negative  returns  of  the  DJIA  at  the  daily  time-scale.  The  two  dashed  lines
show plus or minus one standard deviation std estimated as exposed in the text. The insets
show the same statistics over the extended range of u.

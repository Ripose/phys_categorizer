Abstract 

 
            It  is  demonstrated  that  the  fullerene  shell  affects  dramatically  the  radiative  and 
Auger vacancy decay of an endohedral atom A@C60. The collectivized electrons of the 
C60  shell  add  new  possibilities  for  radiative  and  non-radiative  decays  similar  to  that  in 
ordinary atoms where initial and final state vacancies almost always belong to different 
subshells.    
            It is shown that the smallness of the atomic shell radii as compared to that of the 
fullerenes shell provides an opportunity to derive the simple formulas for the probabilities 
of  the  electron  transitions.  It  is  shown  that  the  radiative  and  Auger  (or  Koster-Kronig) 
widths of a vacancy decay due to electron transition in the atom A in A@C60 acquire an 
additional  factors  that  can  be  expressed  via  the  polarizability  of  the  C60  at  transition 
energy. 
            It  is  demonstrated  that  due  to  opening  of  the  non-radiative  decay  channel  for 
vacancies  in  subvalent  subshells  the  decay  probability  increases  by  five  –  six  orders  of 
magnitude.

1. Introduction 
 

It is already more than thirty years since it was predicted that intra- and inter-shell 
interactions  in  atoms  could  modify  considerably  the  probability  of  the  radiative  and 
Auger-decay  of vacancies in atoms [1]. It was demonstrated that due to this interaction 
the  decay  probability  could  increase  or  decrease,  up  to  complete  disappearance  of  the 
decay photon or electron line. A new phenomenon was predicted, namely radiative self-
locking  of  atomic  shells,  the  essence  of  which  is  complete  suppression  of  the  radiative 
decay of some atomic vacancies due to interelectron interaction [1, 2]. 

Since  then,  new  multi-atomic  and  hence  multi-electronic  structures,  such  as 
metallic  clusters  and  fullerenes,  became  available  and  started  to  be  objects  of  intensive 
investigations.  There  electron  correlation  effects  in  all  processes,  including  vacancies 
decays, could be much stronger than in isolated multi-electron atoms. 

Recently  in  a  number  of  papers  (see  e.g.  [3-5]  and  references  therein)  it  was 
demonstrated that in endohedral systems A@C60, in which atom A is located inside the 
“empty”  inner  part  of  the  C60,  the  photoionization  characteristics  of  atom  A  are 
impressively modified by the C60 shell. 

The aim of this paper is to show that the fullerenes C60 electron shell drastically 
modifies  also  the  decay  probability  of  a  vacancy  in  the  atom  A  in  A@C60.  This 
modification is a result of a number of effects, including opening of new decay channels

is determined by so-called intra- or intershell effects. 

of a vacancy and profound modification of those channels that exist in isolated atom A. 
Namely,  the  decay  can  proceed  due  to  opening  of  new  channels,  which  account  for 
participation  of  C60  electrons.  This  is  similar  to  the  situation  in  ordinary  molecules  [6] 
and clusters [7], where a vacancy in one atom can decay due to transition in another.   
       It is natural to distinguish decays of vacancies in endohedral atoms by the degree of 
participation  of  the  C60  electrons.  Namely,  the  vacancy  in  the  endohedral  atom  can  be 
closed by an outer electron either from the same atom, or from the collectivized electrons 
of  the  C60,  forming  what  could  be  called  atomic  and  fullerenes  decay,  respectively.  If 
atomic  vacancy  is  deep  enough,  it  can  be  closed  be  one  of  the  non-collectivized  inner 
electrons of carbon atoms that form the C60, presenting molecular decay. 
       If  decay  results  with  emission  of  a  photon,  the  C60  shell  can  intercept  it,  and  then 
emit  a  photon  with  the  same  energy.  As  a  result,  the  radiative  decay  and  the  decay 
process  becomes  interference.  Therefore,  the  decay  probability  similar  to  what  was 
predicted in isolated atoms [1] can be altered dramatically, from strong enhancement till 
almost  complete  suppression.  The  same  situation  can  happen  in  the  Auger  decay:  the 
interaction between electrons, inner and outer, can be modified due to virtual excitations 
of  C60  electrons,  thus  substituting  the  pure  Coulomb  inter-electron  interaction  V   by  a 
transferred energy ω dependent effective one 
(see e.g. [8]). The difference between 
V  and 
       The  physical  nature  of  these  so-called  intershell  effects  in  the  vacancy  decay 
processes  has  the  following  meaning.  A  many-electron  atomic  subshell  is  polarized  by 
emission of the decay photon, or in other words, virtually excited by it. Therefore a time-
dependent  dipole  moment  is  induced.  Under  the  action  of  this  dipole  moment  a 
neighboring atomic subshell is ionized. The inclusion of this effect in isolated atoms was 
performed in [1] in the frame of so-called RPAE [9], which  is extremely convenient to 
describe this effect. Since the electronic subshells in an atom are not spatially separated 
well  enough,  the  amplitude  of  such  a  two-step  photo-process  cannot  be  expressed 
accurately enough directly via the dipole polarizabilities of the many-electron subshells. 
       The direct application of RPAE to A@C60 is an extremely complex task. In fact this 
is  a  hard  task  even  for  isolated  atoms,  as  it  was  demonstrated  already  in  Ref.  [1]. 
However  in  A@C60  we  have  an  important  simplifying  factor.  Indeed,  the  radius  of  С60 
shell  significantly  exceeds  that  of  an  encapsulated  atom.  This  makes  it  possible  for 
vacancy decay of the A atom, in the first approximation, to consider the electronic sub-
systems of the fullerene shell and atom as practically independent of each other. For this 
reason, the amplitude of atomic vacancy decay that goes through virtual excitation of the 
С60  shell  electrons  can  be  expressed  directly  via  the  dynamic  polarizability  of  the 
. In those cases when the decay energy is close to or particularly 
fullerene shell 
lover  than  the  frequency  of  plasma  oscillations  of  the  collectivized  electrons  of  the  С60 
shell, the role of this two-step decay becomes decisively important. 
       The  big  difference  between  atomic  and  fullerenes  radii,  as  shown  below,  permits 
deriving the formulas that are valid even beyond the RPAE frame, presenting expressions 
not for all but in principal for experimentally distinguishable decay channels of vacancies 
in  the  A  atoms  encapsulated  in  A@C60  via  experimentally  measurable  dipole 
  and  radiative  decay  probability  of  isolated  atom  A.  The  present 
polarizability 
paper  is  devoted  to  deriving  the  formulas  connecting  the  probabilities  of  radiative  and 
non-radiative  decays  of  the  vacancies  in  the  endohedral  and  free  atoms.  The  method

electrons surround a given atom or an ion. 
 
2. Essential formulae – radiative decay 
 
       The  radiative  decay  amplitude  can  be  presented  by  a  the  following  diagrammatical 
relation [1, 9] 
 
        i                      f               i                f                 i                    f 
                                =                           +                                                                           (1)

       The  interaction  between  atomic  and  C60  electrons  is  included  in  the  lowest  order, 
since  the  radius  R  of  C60  is  much  bigger  than  the  radius  ρ  of  the  atom  A  and  the 
60Ct
of the fullerene C60. So, the addition of each extra interaction line leads to a 
thickness

small  factor 
  in  the  corresponding  contribution  to  the  amplitude  and  as  such 
can  be  neglected.  Note  that  due  to  the  same  reason  and  with  the  desire  to  obtain 
qualitatively sound results we neglect exchange between atomic and C60 electrons.

3. Auger decay 
 
       In  this  section  we  will  start  with  discussing  Auger-decay  that  became  possible  in 
A@C60 while is energetically forbidden in isolated atoms A. We will concentrate only on 
i → , because only for them the radiative decay channel in A is open.

consider the process in the lowest order in interaction between atomic and C60 electrons,

fulleren C60, we cannot present numerical results for the widths of these transitions. 
       Let us turn now to the Auger-decay of those vacancies, for which it is allowed also in 
the  isolated  atom  A.  In  this  case  the  process  has  two  pathways  –  direct  decay  with 
emission  of  atomic  outer  electron  and  indirect  that  leads  to  the  same  atomic  electron 
emission via virtual or real excitation of the C60 electrons

The calculation results of the real and imaginary parts of dynamic polarizability of 
the fullerene shell C60 are given in Fig.1. The experimental photoabsorption cross-section 
for C60 taken from [12] is presented in the inset of this figure. As seen from this figure, 
the  cross  section  is  small  at  threshold  (which  also  means  relatively  low  intensity  of 
discrete excitations) and is dominated by a huge maximum that is called Giant resonance 
well above the threshold. Therefore, in (14) a small contribution of discrete excitations of 
the C60 collectivized electrons are neglected.

affects photoelectrons [4, 5, 15]. This can be taken into account similarly to how it was 
done  in  these  papers.  In  the  Auger-decay  of  a  vacancy  inside  the  atom  A  of  A@C60 
strong  modification  of  its  probability  can  come  from  reflection  and  refraction  of  the

In order to take into account these processes for the Auger- electron’s wave, we

the dipole dynamic polarizability of C60 calculated in Ref. [14]. There the cross-section of 
C60  photoabsorption  was  approximating  by  a  Lorenz  symmetrical  profile  with  the 
experimental  value  of  half  width  of  the  Giant  resonance.  This  profile  was  normalizing 
using  the  sum  rule.  The  Lorenz  shape  is  similar  to  that  for  ideally  conducting  sphere.

7. Conclusions 
 

It  was  demonstrated  in  this  paper  that  the  dynamic  reaction  of  the  C60 
collectivized  electrons  radically  changes  the  probabilities  of  the  radiative  and  non-
radiative  vacancy  decays  in  the  endohedral  atoms.  Existence  of  a  great  number  of  the 

 

12

collectivized  electrons  in  the  fullerene  shell  and  their  participation  in  the  processes  of 
vacancy  decays  in  the  encapsulated  atoms  changes  by  several  orders  of  magnitude  the 
widths of these processes. 

The  small  ratio  of  the  atomic  shell  radius  to  that  of  C60  shell  provides  the 
opportunity  to  obtain  remarkably  simple  formulas  for  the  probabilities  of  the  electron 
transitions. This small parameter makes it possible to consider the electronic sub-systems 
of  the  inner  atom  and  C60  shell  as  weakly  interacting  and  describe  the  effect  of  the 
spherical shell upon the electronic process in the A atom by several universal formulas.   

)(εAF

This is the function 

 [see Eq. (16)], built on the basis of the experimental 
data about energy of electron affinity to the empty fullerene shell and radius of this C60-
shell [8]. By this function are defined the shape of electronic spectra of photoionization 
of an endohedral atom and Auger-vacancy decay in this atom.  
(ωηRR
)

  built  on  the  basis  of  the  experimental  data  about 
photoionization of the C60 shell and making it possible to sequentially consider a dynamic 
reaction  of  the  collectivized  electrons  both  to  the  processes  of  endohedral  atom 
photoionization and to those of radiative recombination.  

This  is  the  function 

And finally, this is the function 

 describing the  non-radiative collapse of 
(ωηAR
)
the  endohedral  atom  vacancy  with  simultaneous  ionization  of  the  fulleren  shell.  The 
remarkable moment here is that all considered here processes are parametrically correctly 
described with no consideration of any details of the electronic structure of the C60 shell. 
Any  attempt  to  take  into  account  this  structure  is  inevitably  accompanied  by  radical 
simplifications,  the  correctness  of  which  is  very  difficult  to  estimate  on  the  pure 
theoretical grounds.

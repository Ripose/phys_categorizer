Abstract 

One of the most important steps in the developmental process of the bacteria cell 

at  the  cellular  level  is  the  determination  of  the  middle  of  the  cell  and  the  proper 

placement of the septum, these being essential to the division of the cell.  In E. coli, 

this  step  depends  on  the  proteins  MinC,  MinD,  and  MinE.    Exposure  to  a  constant 

electric field may cause the bacteria cell division mechanism to change, resulting in 

an  abnormal  cytokinesis.    To  see  the  effects  of  an  external  field  e.g.,  an  electric  or 

magnetic field on this process, we have solved a set of deterministic reaction diffusion 

equations, which incorporate the influence of an electric field.  We have found some 

changes in the dynamics of the oscillations of the min proteins from pole to pole. 

The numerical results show some interesting effects, which are qualitatively in good 

agreement with some experimental results.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Cell division is the process by which a cell separates into two new cells after its 

DNA has been duplicated and distributed into the two regions that will later become 

the future daughter cells.  For a successful cell division to take place, the cell has to 

determine  the  optimal  location  of  the  cell  separation  and  the  time  to  start  the  cell 

cleavage.    This  involves  the  identification  of  the  midpoint  of  the  cell  where  the 

septum or cleavage furrow will form.  For Escherichia coli and other rod-like bacteria, 

evidences have accumulated over the past few years which indicate that the separation 

into two daughter cells is achieved by forming a septum perpendicular to parent cell's 

long axis. To induce the separation, the FtsZ ring (Z ring), a tubulin-like GTPase is 

believed  to  initiate  and  guide  the  septa  growth  by  a  process  called  contraction  [1].  

The Z ring is usually positioned close to the center, but it can also form in the vicinity 

of the cell poles. Two processes are known to regulate the placement of the division 

site:  nucleoid  occlusion  [2]  and  the  action  of  the  min  proteins  [3].    Both  processes 

interfere with the formation of the Z ring that determines the division site.  Nucleoid 

occlusion  is  based  on  cytological  evidence  that  indicates  that  the  Z  ring  assembles 

preferentially  on  those  portions  of  the  membrane  that  do  not  directly  surround  the 

dense nucleoid mass [4].  

 

 

The min proteins that control the placement of the division site are the MinC, the 

MinD,  and  the  MinE  proteins  [3].    Experiments,  involving  the  use  of  modified 

proteins show that MinC is able to inhibit the formation of the FtsZ-ring [5].  MinD is 

an ATPase that is connected peripherally to the cytoplasmic membrane.  It can bind to 

the  MinC  and  activate  the  function  of  the  MinC  [6,7].  Recent  studies  show  that  the 

MinD  can  also  recruit  the  MinC  to  the  membrane.    This  suggests  that  the  MinD 

stimulates the MinC by concentrating the MinC near to its presumed site of activation 

[8,  9].    MinE  provides  topological  specificity  to  the  division  inhibitor  [10].    Its 

expression results in a site-specific suppression of the MinC/MinD action so that the 

FtsZ assembly is allowed at the middle of the cell but is blocked at the other sites [3].  

 

                                                                                    C. Modchang et al. page  3

In  the  absence  of  the  MinE,  the  MinC/MinD  is  distributed  homogeneously  over  the 

entire membrane.  This results in a complete blockage of the Z-ring formation.  The 

long filamentous cells, which are subsequently formed would not be able divide [8, 9, 

11,  12].    Using  fluorescent  labeling,  the  MinE  was  shown  to  attach  to  the  cell  wall 

only in the presence of the MinD [13, 14].   As MinD dictates the location of MinC, 

the  latter  would  oscillate  by  itself.    This  would  result  in  the  concentration  of  the 

division inhibitor at the membrane on either cell end, alternating between being high 

or very low every other 20 s or so [8, 9].  The presence of MinE is not only required 

for  the  MinC/MinD  oscillation,  it  is  also  involved  in  setting  the  frequency  of  the 
oscillation  cycle  [11].    Several  sets  of  evidence indicate  that  the  MinE  localization 

cycle is tightly coupled to the oscillation cycle of MinD.    

 

 

Recent microscopy of the fluorescent labeled proteins involved in the regulation 

of E. coli division have uncovered stable and coherent oscillations (both spatial and 

temporal) of these three proteins [15]. The proteins oscillate from one end to the other 

end  of  the  bacterium,  moving  between  the  cytoplasmic  membrane  and  cytoplasm.  

The  detail  mechanism  by  which  these  proteins  determine  the  correct  position  of  the 

division plane is currently unknown, but the observed pole-to-pole oscillations of the 

corresponding  distribution  are  thought  to  be  of  functional  importance.    Under 

different culture conditions and/or environment changes, (e.g., pH, light, and external 

field) changes in the pole-to-pole oscillations could affect the growth of the bacteria.  

Here we discuss only the effects of an electric field.  

 

 

In the present work, we use a mathematical approach to investigate the influence 

of  the  external  constant  external  field  on  the  cytokinesis  mediated  by  min  protein 

pole-to-pole  oscillation.    We  propose  a  mathematical  model  and  then  solve  it 

numerically  to  see  how  the  min  protein  oscillation  mechanism  for  the  bacteria  cell 

division may change.  We also present some comments about the connection between 

our mathematical approach and the real world experimental results.

II.  Model  

Sets  of  reaction-diffusion  equations  have  often  been  used  in  biological 

applications 

to  model  self-organization  and  pattern  formation  [16]. 

  These 

mathematical equations have two components.  The first component is the diffusion 

term that describes the diffusion of the chemical species.  At the molecular level, the 

diffusion term often results in a net flow of chemical species from the region of high 

concentration to regions of lower concentration. The second component is the reaction 

term that describes the self-organization of the biological systems. 

 

 

We have adopted the dynamic model of compartmentization in the bacterial cell 

division process proposed by Howard et. al. [17] by adding an extra term that depend 

on  the  external  electric  fields.  The  dynamics  of  the  bacteria  in  the  presence  of  the 

external  filed  is  described  by  a  set  of  four  non-linear  coupled  reaction-diffusion 

equations.   We focus on the E. coli bacteria, which is a commonly studied rod shaped 

bacteria of approximately

mµ62 −

in length and around 

mµ5.11 −

 in diameter.  E. coli 

divides  roughly  every  hour  via  cytokinesis.    Our  starting  point  is  the  set  of  one 

dimensional  deterministic  coupled  reaction-diffusion  equations  describing 

the 

dynamics of the interactions between the local concentration of the MinD and MinE 

proteins.  The equations describe the time rates of change of the concentration due to 

the  diffusion  of  the  MinD  and  the  MinE  and  to  the  transfer  between  the  cell 

membrane and the cytoplasm.  The dynamics of these min proteins in the presence of 

an external field, are described by:

respectively.     

d ρρ ,

 are  the  concentrations  of  protein  MinD  and  MinE  on  the

  Since  the 

experimental results given in [9], show that the MinC dynamics simply follows that of 

the MinD, we have not written out the equations for the MinC explicitly. 

The importance feature of our model is the second terms on the right hand sides 

of  the  equations.    They  represent  the  effect  of  the  external  field  in  the  reaction-

diffusion equation [18, 19] controlled by the external field parameter. We assume that 

the chemical substance moving in the regions of an external field will experience the 

force  that  is  proportional  to  the  external  field  parameter  J  times  the  gradient  of  the 

concentration of that substance. In general 

J µ=
E

 where E is the field strength and 

µ is the ionic mobility of the chemical substance. µ, in general, will be proportional 

to  the  diffusion  coefficient  of  the  chemical  substance  and  will  depend  on  the  total 

amount of free charge in that substance. In this model

 is the

 We  assume  that  the  diffusion  coefficients

(

 are  isotropic  and 

independent  of x .  The  constant 

1σ  represents  the  association  of  MinD  to  the 

membrane  wall  [12]. 

1σ′  corresponds  to  the  membrane-bound  MinE  suppressing  the 

recruitment  of  MinD  from  the  cytoplasm. 

2σ  reflects  the  rate  that  the  MinE  on  the 

membrane  drives  the  MinD  on  the  membrane  into  the  cytoplasm.    Based  on  the 

 

                                                                                    C. Modchang et al. page  6

evidence  of  the  cytoplasmic  interaction  between  MinD  and  MinE  [7],  we  let 

3σ  be 

the rate that cytoplasmic MinD recruits the cytoplasmic MinE to the membrane while 

4σ  corresponds  to  the  rate  of  dissociation  of  MinE  from  the  membrane  to  the 

cytoplasm. Finally, 

4σ′  corresponds to the cytoplasmic MinD suppressing the release 

of  the  membrane-bound  MinE.    Evidence  points  to  most  of  the  diffusion  process 

occurring  in  the  cytoplasm.  It  is  therefore  reasonable  to  set 

dD  and 

eD  to  zero.  It 

follows immediately that 

d µµ
= e

0=

 and so

In  our  model  we  assume  that  the  total  number  of  each  type  of  protein  is 

conserved.  We  further  assume  that  the  min  proteins  can  bind/unbind  from  the 

membrane  and  that  the  proteins  do  not  degrade  during  the  process.    The  zero  flux 

boundary conditions are imposed at both ends of the bacterium. The total amounts of 

MinD  and    MinE,  obtained  by  integrating 

D ρρ +
d

 and 

E ρρ +
e

 over  the  length  of 

the bacterium, are conserved. 
 

III.  Numerical  results and discussion 

 

 

Since  the  bacterium  length  is  very  short,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the 

applied electric field has a constant value throughout the bacterium length. We have 

numerically  solved  the  set  of  four  coupled  reaction-diffusion  equations  (1)-(4)  by 

using the explicit Euler method [20].  The size of E. coli is taken to be  mµ2

in length. 

The total time needed for each simulation is approximately 104 s.  In our simulations 

we  have  discretized  space  and  time,  i.e.,  we  have  taken

   The  space  covering  the  bacteria  will  be  divided  into  251  grid  points 
and the time has been divided into 109 times steps (109 iteration steps).  Initially we 

assume that the MinD and MinE are mainly at the opposite ends of the bacterium with 

the number of min molecules in each cell being 3000 for the MinD population [6] and 

170  for  the  MinE  population  [21].    Since  the  total  amount  of  MinD  and  MinE    in 

E.coli must conserve, we have set the flux of MinD and MinE to be zero at both ends 

 

                                                                                    C. Modchang et al. page  7

of  the  bacterium.    Since  there  is  no  experimental  values  of µ for  either  MinD  and 

MinE,  we  work  with  the  external  field  parameter  J  ,  which  is  proportional  to  E, 

instead  of  E  explicitly.    We  also  assume  that 

D µµ =
E

(we  assume  MinD  and  MinE 

have  the  same  type  of  charges).    It  follows  immediately  that

.    In  our  analyses  of  the  numerical  results,  we  looked  at  the  time-

averaged  values  of  the  concentrations  of  MinD  and  MinE  and  at  the  patterns  of  the 

oscillations of MinD and MinE at various J values. 

 

In the absent of the external field, the numerical results [17] show that most of 

the  MinD  will  be  concentrated  at  the  membrane  and  the  MinE  at  the  midcell.    This 

would  result  in  an  accurate  division  at  the  midcell.    In  the  presence  of  the  external 

field, both MinD and MinE will experience the force in the same direction.  This force 

causes a shift of the time average minimum of MinD.   This would shift the division 

site from being at the midcell.  Our numerical solutions show that the behavior of the 

Min  system  in  the  presence  of  an  external  field  will  depend  on  the  strengths  of  the 

external field parameter

)(J . 

    

   

 Figure  1  shows  the  oscillation  patterns  for 

J

m/s.  It is seen that as J increase, both the MinD and MinE concentrations in the left 

part  of  the  E.coli  becomes  larger  while  in  the  right  part,  the  two  concentrations 

become  smaller  as  J  is  increased.    This  behavior  is  a  reflection  of  the  fact  that  the 

external  force  is  acting  in  the  left  direction.  These  patterns  show  the  shifting  in  the 

concentrations of the min proteins towards the left pole. 

In Figure 2 we show the time-averaged concentrations of the MinD and MinE  

proteins at different positions within the bacteria.  In these curves, positive values of 

the external field parameter are used.  From this Figure, we see that in the case of no 

 

                                                                                    C. Modchang et al. page  8

external  field  (J=  0.0)  the  time-averaged  concentrations  of  MinD  and  MinE  are 

symmetric about the midcell.  MinD has a minimum at the midcell while MinE has a  

maximum  at  the  midcell.    When  an  external  field  is  applied,  we  see  a  shift  in  the 

minima  of  MinD  and  in  the  maxima  of  MinE.      The  time-averaged  concentration 

curves are no longer symmetric about the midcell.  In nature, the MinE protein looks 

like  a  ring  structure  that  effectively  positions  the  anti-MinCD  activity    [14,  11]. 

MinCD  inhibits  the  division  process,  so  in  nature  the  bacterium  divides  at  the  site 

where  the  minimum  MinD  concentration  occurs. 

  The  value  of  the  MinE 

concentration  is  not  maximum  at  the  midcell.    The  minimum  of  the  MinD  shifts  to 

right pole under the influence of a positive J values.   

We  have  measured 

the  percentage  of  shifting  of 

the 

time-averaged 

concentration in the local minima of the MinD and local maxima of the MinE.   This 

is shown in Figure 3.   The figure shows that the minimum of MinD is always shift to 

the  right  pole.    This  is  the  result  of  the  external  force  pulling  the  MinD  to  the  left.  

The  maximum  of  MinE  is  not  always  shift  to  the  right.    When  J  <  0.2  m/s  the 

maximum of MinE is shifted to the right but when J > 0.2 it shifted to the left of the 

midcell. This difference arises because of the relative magnitudes of the forces acting 

on  the  two  proteins.    First  of  all,  there  is  an  internal  force  between  the  MinD  and 

MinE proteins.  This force causes the MinE to repel the MinD.  In the absence of any 

other forces, this would explain why the location of the maximum of MinE would be  

the location of minimum of MinD.   When an external field is applied (as expressed 

by a non zero value of J), then one must take into account the relative magnitudes of 

the two forces. 

 

When  J  is  large  (larger  than  2  m/s)  the  external  force  would  dominate  the 

internal force between the MinD and MinE proteins.  The external force would pull 

the MinD and MinE in the same direction causing the location of the maximum of the 

MinE  to  be  no  longer  at  the  location  of  the  minimum  of  the  MinD.      If  J  is  small 

(smaller than 0.2 m/s), the internal force between MinD and MinE will be dominate.  

 

                                                                                    C. Modchang et al. page  9

This would result in the two location (one of the maximum of MinE and the other of 

the minimum of MinD) to be nearly the same.  In Fig. 3, we also see that the shifts of 

the  minimum  of  the  MinD  concentrations  increase  as  the  field  parameter J increase.  

Since the division site will be the location where MinD concentration is minimum, the 

shifting  in  the  minimum  of  MinD  concentration  to  the  right  pole  indicate  that  the 

division  site  must  also  sift  to  the  right  pole.  When  we  set  J  to  be  the  negative,  the 

results are very similar to those of the positive J values as expected, curve for the time 

averages  of  the  concentration  of  the  min  proteins  shifts  in  the  mirror  side  about  the 

midcell. 

 

In  Figs.  4a  and  4b.  we  show  the  concentrations  of  the  MinD  and  MinE 

proteins  at  the  left  end  grid,  the  middle  grid  and  the  right  end  grid  versus  time.  In 

these  figures,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  when  J=  0.0  m/s,  the  concentration  of  MinD  (or 

MinE) at the left end grid and the right end grid have the same pattern of oscillation, 

with the same frequency and amplitude, with phase difference 180º.   At the midcell 

grid, the frequency of the oscillation is two times greater than that of right end grid. 

When  the  external  field  is  applied,  the  amplitude  of  the  oscillations  at  the  two  end 

grids are no longer equal but the frequency of the oscillation of the three grids become 

the same.  As J is increased, the amplitude of the oscillation at the right end grid is 

seen to decrease while that of the left end and midcell grids are seen to increase. 

 

Figure 5 show the periods of the oscillation of MinD concentration at the left 

end grid for various value of J.  In this figure we see that for the case of no external 

field, the period of the oscillation is equal to 115 s which is in good agreement with 

the  experimental  value.  When  the  external  field  is  applied,  the  period  of  the 

oscillation  is  seen  to  increase.  When  J  is  not  too  large  (J<0.3)  the  period  of  the 

oscillation will increase as J is increased.  The increase in the period of oscillation as 

an  external  field  is  applied  indicates  that  in  the  presence  of  an  external  field,  the 

bacterium needs a longer time to divide.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

Proper  divisions  of  the  bacteria  require  the  accurate  definition  of  the  division 

site  [3].    This  accurate  identification  of  the  division  site  is  determined  by  the  rapid 

pole-to-pole oscillations of the MinCDE [8, 11, 22].  Using a mathematical model to 

describe the dynamics of the min pole-to-pole oscillations, Howard et al. [17], found 

that  the  midcell  position  in  the  Escherichia  coli  bacteria,  correspond  to  the  point 

where  the  time  averaged  MinD  and  MinE  concentration  were  minimum  and 

maximum, respectively.  They also found that the concentrations of these two proteins 

were symmetric about the midcell position. 

To  see  the  effect  of  exposing  a  E.  coli  bacteria  to  an  electric  field,  we  have 

added  some  additional  terms  to  the  reaction  diffusion  equations  for  the  pole-to-pole 

oscillation of the min proteins in the E. coli bacteria proposed by Howard et al.  The 

additional terms are the gradient terms appearing in eqns. (1)–(4). These terms depend 

on  the  strength  of  the  external  field  and  the  charge  of  the  protein.    We  then  used  a 

numerical  scheme  to  solve  the  resulting  coarse-grained  coupled  reaction-diffusion 

equations.  The results are shown in Figures 1 to 5.  Our results shows deviations from 

the results obtained by Howard et al., e.g. the concentrations of the MinD and MinE 

are no longer symmetric about the middle of the long axis nor are the minimum and 

maximum  of  the  MinD  and  MinE  concentrations  at  the  middle  of  long  axis.      The 

shifting in the minimum of the time average concentration of MinD from the midcell 

should  results  in  the  shifting  of  the  division  site.  The  shift  of  the  minimum 

concentration of MinD from the mid point appears to be dependent on the strength of 

the  external  field.  This  indicates  that  if  the  parent  cell  can  divide  under  these 

condition it must divide into two filamentous cells, provide that the external field is 

strong enough.  Since the external field can cause the shifting in the minimum of the 

 

                                                                                    C. Modchang et al. page 11

time average concentration of MinD, an external electric field can interfere with the 

division process.

from  blue  to  red,  denotes  an  increasing  in  the  concentration  from  the  lowest  to  the 

highest. The MinD depletion from midcell and the MinE enhancement at the midcell 

are  immediately    seen.  The  vertical  scale  spans  time  for  500  s.  The  times  increase 

from  bottom  to  top  and  the  oscillations  pattern  repeats  infinitely  as  time  increases. 

The horizontal scale spans the bacterial length (

2 mµ ). Note the increase in the MinD

Normal human heart rate shows complex fluctuations in time, which is natural, since heart rate
is  controlled  by  a  large  number  of  different  feedback  control  loops.  These  unpredictable
fluctuations have been shown to display fractal dynamics, long-term correlations, and 1/f noise.
These characterizations are statistical and they have been widely studied and used, but  much
less is known about the detailed time evolution (dynamics) of the heart rate control mechanism.
Here we show that a simple one-dimensional Langevin-type stochastic difference equation can
accurately model the heart rate fluctuations in a time scale from minutes to hours. The model
consists of a deterministic nonlinear part and a stochastic part typical  to  Gaussian  noise,  and
both parts can be directly determined from the measured heart rate data. Studies of 27 healthy
subjects  reveal  that  in  most  cases  the  deterministic  part  has  a form  typically  seen  in  bistable
systems: there are two stable fixed points and one unstable one.

1. Introduction

Various methods and models have been used in attempts to characterize the dynamics of the heart
rate control mechanism. For short time periods and under stationary conditions there are successful
models of heart rate and blood pressure regulation1,2, but the characterization of long-term behavior
has been a very difficult problem. Some models have been introduced in order to explain long-term
fluctuations, but usually they can only describe well-controlled in vitro experiments, or the models
depend on large number of parameters, which cannot be easily determined from experimental data3.
Furthermore,  these  models  can  predict  only  global  statistical  features  like  scaling  properties  of
power spectrum and correlations4 and tell us very little about the details of the time evolution.

Many  features  can  be  extracted  from  long-term  heart  beat  measurements,  quantities  like
entropy measures5-12, correlation dimension13-18, detrended fluctuations19-21, fractal dimensions22-24,
spectrum power-law exponents21,25 and symbolic dynamics complexity26-28, but these are all purely
statistical  characterizations  and  as  such  cannot  provide  us  a  mathematical  model  of  heart  rate
dynamics, not even a simple one.  However,  some  of  these  statistical  methods  do  characterize  the
complexity  of  the  dynamics  underlying  the  time  series29,  or  are  directly  related  to  their  fractal  or
chaotic features. Mathematical analysis of many  physiological  rhythms, including  long-term heart
rate fluctuations, has revealed that they are generated by processes which must be nonlinear, since
linear systems cannot produce such a complex behaviour30. Nonlinear purely deterministic models
can display chaotic dynamics and generate apparently unpredictable oscillations, but in practice it
has  not  yet  been  possible  to  extract  such  models  from  real  noisy  experimental  data.  It  is  also
possible  that  the  underlying  system  is  stochastic,  i.e.,  its  time  evolution  is  influenced  by  a  noise
source.  [Here  we  consider  dynamical  noise  and  not  measurement  noise,  which  has  no  role  in  the
time evolution.]  Indeed, there is increasing  evidence that noise, originated  either  from  the  system
itself or from its reaction to random external influences, is actually an integral part of the dynamics
of biological systems31-33.

A  typical  R-R  interval  recording  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  time  series  is  generated  by
recording  a  24-hour  electrocardiogram  and  detecting  the  R-peak  from  each  heartbeat,  the  R-R

interval is the  time  difference  between  two  consecutive  R-peaks.  In  the  upper  panel  of  Fig.  1  we
have the R-R interval time series for 6 hours. We can see  sections  where oscillations  in  the heart
rate  are  rather  regular  but  there  are  also  abrupt  changes.  In  the  lower  panel  of  Fig.  1  we  have
zoomed  into  a  part  of  the  time  series,  about  50  minutes,  and  also  on  this  time  range  we  can  see
apparently random oscillations with rapid changes.

It  is  well  known  that  most  short-time  fluctuations  in  the  heart-rate  are  generated  by
respiration  (periods  typically  in  the  couple  of  seconds  range)  and  blood  pressure  regulation  (so
called Meyer waves with periods of about 10 seconds)34. In the following we are not interested in
these fast rhythms (which can be analyzed quite well using linear or semi-linear models) but rather
in  time  scales  from  minutes  to  hours.  We  will  show  that  in  this  time  range  the  dynamics  of  the
heart-rate  fluctuations  can  be  well  described  by  a  one-dimensional  Langevin  type  stochastic
difference equation. This equation contains a deterministic part and additive Gaussian noise, and we
have  found  that  it  works  well  when  the  delay  parameter  in  the  equation  is  in  the  range  of  2-20
minutes.

2. The model

An  important  and  wide  class  of  dynamic  systems  can  be  described  by  the  Langevin  differential
equation35,36

Here X(t) represent the state of the system at time t,  the function g gives the nonlinear deterministic
change,  and  in  the  last  term  h  is  the  amplitude  of  the  stochastic  contribution  and  (cid:1)(t)  stands  for

           (1)

uncorrelated  white  noise  with  vanishing  mean.  [These  kinds  of  stochastic  differential  equations
always need an interpretation rule for the noise term, normally one uses the Ito interpretation35,37].
In  general  the  functions  g  and  h  could  depend  explicitly  on  time  t.  Equation  (1)  can  be  easily
generalized to higher dimensions. We will now show that long-term behavior of heart rate can be
modeled using a difference version of the Langevin equation35

Here X(t) again represents the state of the system, in this case the R-R interval, at time t, and (cid:1) is the
time delay.  If  arbitrary  small delays (cid:1)  are possible  then  one  can  take  the  limit  (cid:1)  (cid:2)  0  and  get  the
differential  equation  (1) [if  the (cid:1) dependence is given by g(X(t);(cid:1))  (cid:3)  (cid:1)  g(X(t))],  but  in  the  present
case it will turn out that there is a minimum (cid:1) for which model (2) seems to be valid. We assume
that  g  and  h  are  independent  of  the  time  t,  but  they  may  depend  on  the  delay  parameter  (cid:1).  It  is
convenient to extract the term X(t) in the deterministic part, then a nonzero g(X(t);(cid:1)) causes changes
in the state of the system. An essential feature of models of the above type is that for time evolution
we only need to know the state at one given moment and not its evolution in the past, i.e., they are
Markovian35,38.

The computational problem is now to determine the functions g and h from measured time  series
and  to  verify  that  the  description  using  (2)  is  accurate.  The  principle  of  the  method  is  very
simple39,40: at every time ti when the trajectory of the system meets an arbitrary but fixed point x in
state space, we look at the future state of  the system at time ti + (cid:1). The set of these future values
(for  a  chosen  x  and  (cid:1))  has  a  distribution  in  the  state  space  and  from  this  distribution  we  can
determine the deterministic part g(x) and the stochastic part h(x), see Fig. 2A.  In practice we first
divide  the  range  of  the  dynamical  variable  X  into  equal  boxes.  By  scanning  the  whole  measured
, where  x is  the  middle
time series we check when  X is inside a  given box  x,  i.e., 
value of the box and (cid:4)x is the half width of the box. When X(ti) is found on the box, we look at the
future value of the variable, X(ti+(cid:1)), where (cid:1)  is the chosen delay parameter. Since the trajectory of

Figure 2. Schematic presentation of the  method for analyzing stochastic time  series and calculating the deterministic
and stochastic parts of the dynamics (Fig. A). Whenever the trajectory of the system passes near a certain point x in the
state phase, i.e. X(ti) (cid:1) x, the future value X(ti + (cid:1)) of the trajectory is recorded. The distribution of these values is fitted
by a Gaussian function with mean x + g(x) and deviation h(x), c.f., equation (2). This is repeated for all x-values. On the
right are two typical examples of the distribution of future values, the initial x values are marked with a blue vertical bar

the  system  passes  each  box  several  times,  we  can  calculate  the  distribution  of  the  future  values
X(ti+(cid:1)) for each box x. If we assume that the noise is Gaussian, we can fit a Gaussian function on
each distribution, and as a result we get the mean and the deviation parameters for each x; the mean
of this distribution is equal to x+g(x) and the deviation is equal to h(x)41,42. A typical case is given in
Fig.  2B,  and  it  shows  that  the  distribution  is  actually  very  well  described  by  Gaussian  noise  (the
correlation is better than 0.95). From the given data we can in this way determine the functions g(X)
and  h(X)  needed  in  the  stochastic  model  (2).  It  should  be  noted  that  we  can  calculate  only  the
absolute value of h(X) since the deviation parameter found from the fitted Gaussian function is in
squared form.

In  our  analysis  we  have  used  R-R  interval  time  series  of  22  –  24  hours,  corresponding  to
80.000 – 100.000 data points. Our data is actually interval data, i.e., it consists of a sequence of R-R
interval values. It is then convenient to count the delay in our analysis in terms of heartbeats rather
than seconds, i.e., we have not used cumulative time as time variable but the beat index. However,
since the R-R interval values vary a lot within the used delay range the beat index actually gives a
delay  as  if  computed  with  the  average  beat-rate.    We  have  tested  both  methods  and  found  only
minor differences between them (in the details of the functions g and h). We will show later that the
functional forms of g and h are rather insensitive on the time delay, and since this holds for both
methods we will use the more convenient beat index.

3. Analysis of results

In Fig. 3 we have presented results obtained for a particular case using the method described earlier.
The value of the delay parameter (cid:1) was 500 beats, and the number of boxes used to construct local
distributions was 150. Distributions were fitted using a Gaussian function.  The  g(X)  function,  the
deterministic  part  of  the  system,  is  displayed  on  the  left  panel  in  Fig.  3.  It  has  a  very  clear  and
simple functional form (between the vertical lines) which is typical for systems exhibiting bistable
behavior35,43.  The  function  crosses  the  zero  line  three  times,  these  crossings  are  the  fixed  points

Figure  3.  Typical  results  derived  from  R-R  interval  time  series  using  time  delay  (cid:1)  =  500.  We  have  shown  the
deterministic part g(X) (the left panel), the stochastic part h(X) (the middle panel) and the correlation coefficient of the
distribution  (the  right  panel)  as  a  function  of  the  dynamical  variable  X.  The  range  corresponding  to  the  correlation
threshold level of 0.8 is marked with the vertical lines.

of the system. The fixed points marked with arrows are stable: without any noise term these points
attract all nearby states, because the control function g(X) is locally decreasing.  The middle fixed
point is repulsive. Due to the stochastic part the system has a tendency to jump between the stable
points if the amplitude of the noise is high enough. Far away from the stable points g(X) increases
or  decreases  strongly  forcing  the  system  rapidly  back  to  oscillate  around  the  stable  points.  The
amplitude of the stochastic part of the system, function h(X), is almost constant except between the
stable points where it has a clear maximum (the middle panel in Fig. 3).  One interpretation is that
the system has a larger inherent freedom to oscillate randomly when the trajectory is between the
stable  points  but  outside  this  range  the  character  of  the  system  is  more  deterministic.  From  the
physiological point of view this kind of control dynamics can be useful since it lets the R-R interval
to wander most of the time but prevents it from escaping too far away from the normal range. On
the right panel in Fig. 3 we have shown the correlation coefficient of each local distribution. Most
of the time the correlation is remarkably high, about 0.85 – 0.95, but near the largest and smallest X
values  there  are  only  rather  few  data  points  and  therefore  the  corresponding  distributions  do  not
have clear Gaussian shape resulting with lower correlation. The high average correlation value is a
clear indication that the noise in this system is really Gaussian type. We have used the value of 0.8
as a threshold level, and the corresponding range is marked with the vertical lines in Fig. 3.

What is remarkable in this description is that the functional forms of g(X) and h(X) are fairly
 
independent of the delay parameter (cid:1) in a rather extensive delay range, typically 100 – 1000 beats
(corresponding to 2 – 20 minutes). In Fig. 4 we have plotted the functions g(X) and h(X) for a range
of (cid:1) values. The g-function is practically (cid:1) independent, except for the shortest R-R intervals, where
some cumulative effects show up. The h-function seems to grow very slowly as (cid:1) increases. For still
smaller  delay  values  g(X)  is  more  flat  and  h(X)  is  more  scattered,  and  for  longer  delays  g(X)  is
typically a straight line and h(X) is constant. Behavior at these extremes can be easily understood by
recalling  that  when  the  time  scale  is  small,  the  heart  rate  system  is  clearly  multidimensional

depending directly on blood pressure, respiration and other rapidly changing physiological variables
and our 1-dimensional description is no longer valid. On the other hand, if the delay parameter is
very large, we cannot reconstruct the local dynamics in terms of local distributions, we just get the
global  distribution  that  is  independent  of  dynamics  and  no  longer  Gaussian.  In  the  right  panel  of
Fig. 4 we have given the values of the g(X) function at X = 780 ms (marked with a vertical dashed
line in the left panel) computed with delays of 5 – 10240 beats. We can see a plateau in the delay
range  of  100  –  1000  beats  which  means  that  the  g(X)  curves  for  these  delays  are  bundled.  In
principle  the  curves  for  a  delay  of  2(cid:1)  should  be  obtainable  by  iterating  (2)  with  delay  (cid:1).  Direct
numerical  calculations  of  joint  probabilities  using  experimentally  determined  g(X)  (within  100  -
1000  beats  delay  range)  indicate  that  g(X)    and  h(X)  do  not  change  significantly  in  one  iteration,
mostly because in our case the Gaussian distribution is not so narrow. In general iterations tend to

sharpen the bends in g(X) and this feature is indeed visible in Figure 4. The small (cid:1)-dependency of g
and h in the range of short R-R intervals can then be interpreted either as the expected result from
repeated iterations, or as a sign of higher order dynamics: possibly the heart rate regulation system
is more complex when the system must readjust at a fast heart rate.

In  order  to  find  out  whether  different  subjects  have  are  any  common  features  in  the
deterministic and stochastic parts g(X) and h(X) we analyzed the data from 27 healthy subjects of
various age and gender (18 cases from PhysioBank44 and 9 cases from Kuopio University Hospital).
Analyses were done using the same parameter values as in Fig. 3. The deterministic part, the g(X)
function, is displayed in Fig. 5 for a set of 9 typical cases. The most common form for this function
is the bistable type, already shown in Figure 3, where the g(X) function has three zeroes, and 60%
of all cases can be classified into this group (cases 1 – 5 in Fig. 4). The next most common group,
25% of all cases, has a g(X) function with 5 zeroes, a kind of multistable situation (cases 6 and 7 in
Fig. 4). We also found 3 cases where the g(X) function seems to have even more zeroes (case 8 in
Fig. 4). Only very few cases could not be clearly classified as bi- or multistable. In these cases it can
be  difficult  to  interpret  the  results.  It  is  possible  that  the  dynamical  variable  did  not  explore  the
whole state phase, and therefore we can see only part of the g(X) function; for example case 9 in
Fig. 5, where the system has only one stable  fixed point and no unstable points at all, can be  an
example  of  this.  The  stochastic  parts  (function  h(X))  are  fairly  similar:  they  are  almost  constant
except that in all cases there are maxima on the R-R interval ranges between the stable fixed points
of the deterministic part, as in the example in Fig. 3.

The  description  given  by  equation  (2)  contains  both  a  deterministic  and  a  stochastic
component. It is an important to realize that the stochastic part is not a small perturbation but in fact
forms an essential part of the description, furthermore it is 10-20 times higher than the measurement
noise (uncertainty in detecting the position of the R-peak), which is typically only 2-5 ms. One way
to compare the deterministic and stochastic components is to note that the size of the bend in the
g(X) function is of the order of 30 to 50 ms, while the average size of the h(X) function is about 70
to 110 ms, as can be seen in Figure 3. [The extraction of small details in the g(X) function under
such noise is of course possible only because the noise is so cleanly Gaussian.] On the other hand,
the distance between the stable fixed points in the g(X) function is of the order of 50 to 250 ms, and
therefore  the  probability  that  the  systems  jumps  between  stable  points  is  not  extremely  high,  but
nevertheless possible. It is also possible that external factors drive the system from one stable point
to another, since during night-time the mean R-R interval is typically longer than during day-time
[although the R-R interval can abruptly jump to the faster rate also during the night, as can be seen
on the lower panel in Fig.1].

As  a  further  validity  check  we  performed  surrogate  analysis45,46  in  order  to  eliminate  the
possibility that the results are generated just from a peculiar distribution of R-R intervals imitating
real  dynamics.  For  this  purpose  the  data  was  shuffled  by  dividing  it  into  sections  of  equal  size
which were then repositioned randomly. As a result we get a new time series where the dynamical
structure  has  been  partially  destroyed  depending  on  the  section  size.  Results  of  this  surrogate
analysis are shown in Fig. 6. The top panels display the deterministic g(X) and stochastic h(X) parts
of the system and the correlation coefficient without any data shuffling (row A in Fig. 6). On the
next row (row B in Fig. 6) we have used sections of 800 data points for shuffling. There are small
changes  in  the  deterministic  part,  but  the  correlation  has  decreased  noticeably.  When  the  section
size is 400 (row C in Fig. 6) we can no longer see the bistable character in the deterministic part, the
stochastic part is flat with higher mean level, and the average level of the correlation coefficient has
dropped  well  below  our  threshold  value  0.8.  With  still  smaller  section  sizes  the  results  do  not
change any further. In this analysis we have used the same delay of 500 data points as previously

data has been shuffled using section sizes of 800 (B) and 400 (C) data points.

and  when  the  section  size  used  in  the  shuffling  process  is  less  than  this  delay  all  dynamical
properties disappear, as expected in the case of true time evolution. Therefore we conclude that our
results are derived from the dynamical properties of the heart beat data, and not from their overall
statistical characteristics.

Conclusion

Our results indicate that the human heart-rate control dynamics can be accurately modeled with the
1-dimensional  stochastic  difference  equation  (2),  where  the  time  delay  parameter  is  within  2-20
minutes. Stochasticity is an integral part of the dynamics, and in this delay range the effects of other
variables are either embedded into the stochastic part of the system or averaged over time with no
net effect. It is remarkable that the form of the control function g(X) is similar from case to case.
Their typically bistable character is also well justified on common physiological grounds.

From this initial study we cannot yet identify what kind of dynamical structure is typical for
healthy subjects, and therefore the model cannot yet be used for clinical work. For that purpose one
needs  extensive  demographic  studies.  We  can  nevertheless  speculate  that  the  form  of  the  control
function  g(X)  should  tell  us  something  about  the  health  of  the  subject.  Also,  some  of  the  current
knowledge based on statistical measures of heart rate time series can probably be explained within
the  framework  of  our  model.  Another  interesting  observation  is  the  importance  of  the  stochastic

but it could also reflect some truly stochastic internal and external influences.

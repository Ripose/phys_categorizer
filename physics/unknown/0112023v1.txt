Abstract

We  propose  an  effective  harmonic  oscillator  model  in  order  to  treat  the

fluctuations  of  the  gravitational,  strong  and  weak  nuclear  fields.  With  respect  to  the

gravitational field, first we use the model to estimate its fluctuating strength, necessary to

decohere  the  wavefunction  of  a  cubic  centimeter  of  air  at  the  standard  temperature  and

pressure conditions. Second, the fluctuation of a point mass through a distance equal to

the  Planck  length  leads  to  the  self-gravitational  interaction  of  a  particle,  which  can  be

related to its de Broglie frequency. Third, by making the equality of the fluctuating field

strength with the gravitational field of a mass M at half of its Schwarzschild radius, we

obtain an estimate of the mass of the Universe. We also consider the fluctuations of the

strong nuclear field, as a means to estimate the separation in energy between the ground

state and the centroid of the excitated states of the nucleon. Finally, taking into account

the neutron-proton mass difference, we use the fluctuations of the weak nuclear field in

order to evaluate the weak coupling constant.

  1- Introduction

1

In his paper: “Why do we observe a classical spacetime?”, Joos [1] concludes that

the smallness of the Planck’s length is not sufficient to explain the absence of quantum

effects  of  gravitation.  As  was  pointed  out  by  Joos  [1]:  “Instead,  in  order  to  become

classical, spacetime has to be continuously measured by matter.” In order to demonstrate

this  last  statement  Joos  has  considered  essentially  the  fluctuations  of  the  gravitational

field,  when  measured  by  the  content  of  a  cubic  centimeter  of  air  at  the  standard

temperature and pressure conditions (STP), during a period of one second.

In this letter, we intend to show that, working in a similar way as Joos did, we can

get information about the structure of matter, perhaps of far reaching consequences.

In  section  2,  through  an  oversimplified  calculation,  we  evaluate  a  relative

fluctuation of the gravitational field which is two orders of magnitude  smaller than  that

obtained through Joos more refined calculations [1]. In section 3 we use the same method

as  a  means  of  speculating  about  the  origin  of  the  driving  force  responsible  for  the

establishment  of  the  de  Broglie  frequency.  In  the  section  4,  the  present  “formalism”  is

used  to  estimate  the  mass  of  the  Universe.  Section  5  applies  this  “formalism”  to  the

fluctuations of the color field. The estimation of the weak force strength is worked out in

section 6. We finish this letter in section 7 with some concluding remarks.

  2- An alternative way to Joos derivation

Let  us  consider  a  typical  particle  of  rest  mass  m  coupled  to  a  fluctuating  local
gravitational field ∆gi. We suppose that, under the action of this field, this particle suffers

a displacement xi from its mean position. If we assume, as it seems to be natural, that the

fluctuating field has equal probability to take negative and positive values, the first non-

zero  contribution  for  the  interaction  between  the  particle  and  the  field  comes  from  the

second moment of this interaction. So, we can write for N particles

Choosing the sample of 1 cm3 of air as the tool used to measure the fluctuating field, we

In  (2),  we  identify  the  effective  potential  ∆U   with  a  harmonic  oscillator  of  spring

constant k and vs stands for the velocity of the sound in air at the STP.
Then,  the angular frequency ω is given by

The  maximum  variation  of  the  phase  of  the  wave  function  of  this  effective  quantum

Using this result in (3) for t=1s,  Ν ∼ 5 x 109 and vs ≈ 3.5 x 102 m/s, we obtain ∆g ∼ 10-7
m/s2 and

∆g/g ∼ 10-8.

The  relative  fluctuation  of  the  gravitational  field  evaluated  here  is  two  orders  of

magnitude  smaller  than  the  result  obtained  by  Joos  [1].  However,  we  can  extract  some

other  interesting  results  if  we  consider  other  kinds  of  fields  and  even  the  gravitational

field acting in other circunstances, working in an analogous way as that presented in this

section. This is the objective of the following sections.

  3- Origin of the de Broglie frequency

Let us consider a single particle (N=1). Here, in order to normalize the  effective

interaction of the fluctuating gravitational field, we will take the “normalizing” energy E0
=  2mc2,  when  the  field  strength  is  sufficiently  high  to  create  a  pair  of  particles  of  rest

mass m. Then, we can write:

Penrose [2] attributes the existence of accurate clocks to the possibility of associating a de

Broglie frequency [3] to each particle of mass m. Also, as was pointed out by Anandan

[4], from an operational point  of view, gravity  appears  to  be  deeply  rooted  in  the  wave

particle duality of matter. Then it seems that to identify the frequency due to a fluctuating

local gravitational field, given by (5), with the de Broglie frequency, could be perhaps a

reasonable hyphothesis. Taking into account these considerations, we can write

constant,  !  the reduced Planck’s constant and c the speed of light. Then, we can imagine
that the mass of a point particle could fluctuate in position through a distance equal to the

Planck  length.  This  generates  a  fluctuating  local  gravitational  field  and  the  coupling  of

the  particle  to  this  field  (self-interaction)  could  be  interpreted  as  the  driving  force

responsible  for  the  particle  “internal  motion”  which  sets  up  the  Penrose  [2,4]  clock.  A

result  similar  to  (7)  has  been  obtained  by  the  present  author  [5],  through  somewhat

different reasonings.

  4- The Mass of the Universe
We  can  also  compare  the  ∆g  given  by  (5)  with  the  gravitational  field  of  the

Universe of mass M, at half of its Schwarzschild radius rs. We have

The above  result  is the  same  as  that found in a paper by  Sharma  and  Sharma  [6]  as  an

upper  bound  on  the  particle  mass,  which  they  proposed  to  be  equal  to  the  mass  of  the

  5- Fluctuations of the Color Field and the Nucleon energy levels

In  (10),  ∆Ψ   is  the  fluctuation  amplitude  of  the  strong  color  field  and  es   is  the  color
charge. We will take the normalization energy as E0=2m π c2,the energy sufficient for the
creation  of  a  pion  pair,  where  m π  is  the  mass  of  the  pion  (+).  The  effective  harmonic

oscillator of spring constant ks, leads to the frequency

If we consider, as Yukawa did [7], that the strong nuclear force is intermediated by the

It  is  worth  to  notice  that,  on  writing  (12),  we  have  identified  ω

s   with  the  de  Broglie

frequency of the pion. From (11) and (12) we obtain, for the strong field strength,

In (14) the left side gives the amplitude of the strong force and the right side is just the

amplitude of the driving force associated to the interpretation of the de Broglie frequency

of  the  pion  through  a  harmonic  oscillator  model  [5]  (see  also  (7)  and  the  subsequent

discussion).

It  would  be  interesting  to  make  an  evaluation  of  ∆Ψ   in  terms  of  an  equivalent

electric field. If we consider  es

∼ 137e , where  e  is the proton electric charge, we obtain

∆Ψ  equivalent

∼ 1022 V/m.

The  above  value  can  be  compared  with  the  electric  field  strength  at  the  surface  of  the

atom of Uranium [8] which is ∼ 1021 V/m.

In order to pursue further with our reasoning, and  taking the  harmonic  oscillator

model as a paradigm, let us consider the absolute value of the averaged potential energy

of the strong force field as half of the “rest” energy of the pion. We then have,

Then we obtain for rs, the mean radius of the nucleon, the relation

compared  with  600  MeV,  the  separation  in  energy  between  the  ground  state  and  the

centroid of the excited states of the nucleon as quoted by Brown and Rho [9].

  6- Estimation of the Weak Force Strength

In  a  similar  way  as  we  have  treated  the  strong  color  field,  we  consider  now  the

field  associated  to  the  weak  coupling.  To  to  this,  we  must  take  into  account  that  the

particles  which  intermediate  the  weak  coupling  are  the  W+  bosons  [10]  of  mass  mw.

Then, working in an analogous way as that of the strong field case, we can write

where  (20)  is  the  equivalent  to  (11)  of  the  strong  field  case,  ∆Φ is  the  strength  of  the

weak  field  and  ew   is  the  “weak  charge”.  Ommiting  steps  analogous  to  those  which  go

Equation (21) for the weak field is the equivalent to (19) of the strong field. The energy

level spacing in (21) can be interpreted as the  mass  difference  between  the neutron and

the proton. As it is well known, the weak force is responsible for the neutron decay [11].

This value for the weak coupling constant is within the values estimated for it as quoted

in some textbooks. (See for example, Halzen and Martin [14] ).

  7 - Concluding Remarks

7

In this letter we have treated the fields responsible for various kinds of coupling,

namely: gravitational, strong and weak nuclear couplings, through the introduction of an

effective harmonic oscillator model. The discrepancy we have met between our treatment

and the more accurate one of Joos [1], could be due to the simplified way we have treated
the many-body effects of the 1019 particles present in a cubic centimeter of air at STP. So,

the results obtained in section 2 of this letter must be considered with caution. However,

by using this effective harmonic oscillator “formalism” , we also have been able to obtain

interesting information when we applied it to the study of the driving force behind the de

Broglie frequency, the energy level separation in the nucleon, the evaluation of the weak

coupling  constant  through  the  neutron-proton  mass  difference,  and  an  estimate  of  the

mass of the Universe.

Finally,  although  the  calculations  we  have  perfomed  in  this  letter  are  somewhat

qualitative,  perhaps  they  can  be  justified  if  we  take  into  account  the  generallity  of  the

applications and the intuitive feeling we have achieved about some fundamental physical

phenomena.

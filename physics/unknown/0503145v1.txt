Short Title: Multi-element electrostatic lenses 
 
Abstract 
 
This paper describes theoretical modelling of electrostatic lenses based on 3, 4 and 5 closely spaced cylindrical 
electrodes, respectively. In each case, modelling is carried out numerically using commercial packages SIMION 
and  LENSYS,  and  a  variety  of  performance  parameters  are  obtained.  These  include  the  magnification,  the  3rd 
order  spherical  and  chromatic  aberration  coefficients.  Special  cases  such  as  zoom  lens  (i.e.,  lenses  whose 
magnification  may  be  changed  without  losing  focus)  are  considered.  Results  are  obtained  as  a  function  of  the 
ratios of the electrode lengths and gaps, and as a function of ratios of the controlling voltages.  
 
As a result, it is shown that how a multi-element lens system can be operated with the whole focal properties in a 
useful mode for using in experimental studies.  
 
Keywords: multi-element lenses, electron optics, zoom lens, aberration coefficients, SIMION and LENSYS. 

1.  Introduction 
 
Electrostatic  lenses  are  widely  used  to  control  beams  of  charged  particle  with  various  energy  and 
directions in several fields, especially in electron spectroscopy. Therefore their focal properties have 
been  extensively  studied  theoretically  and  also  experimentally.  It  is  well  known  that  a  two-element 
lens system cannot keep the image position constant while varying the ratio of final to initial electron 
energy.  For  that  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  add  at least  one  further  element  to  the  system.  The  three-
element  lens  systems  can  be  operated  while  keeping  the  image  position  constant.  Two-element 
electrostatic  lenses  have  been  used  in  low-energy  electron  spectrometers  to  increase  sensitivity  and 
resolution [1-3]. Details of the properties several types of two-element lenses can be found in Refs. [4-
14]. The focal properties of three-element lenses with zoom type of optics have been obtained by Refs. 
[15-22] for various diameters and voltage ratios. One of the types of the three-element lens is as  an 
(cid:147)einzel(cid:148) lens in which the outer electrode are held at the same potential and beam focusing is achieved 
by  varying  the  potential  of  the  centre  electrode.  Einzel  (unipotential)  lenses  are  necessary  when  a 
beam  is  to  be  focused  without  changing  its  energy  [23-27].  The  condition  of  higher  energy  at  the 
centre of three-element lenses results in a lower aberration coefficient of the image and this mode of 
operation is preferred.  Details of aberration coefficients have been determined in Refs. [28-30].  
 
Several  zoom  lenses  which  consist  of  four  elements  are  used  to  ensure  that  focusing  in  the 
monochromator  and  analyser  optics  would  be  independent  of  the  electron  kinetic  energy  [31,  32]. 
Therefore significant effort in the past has been made to determine the focal properties of these lenses. 
Although  multi-element  lenses  are  expected  to  be  more  flexible  and  allow  controlling  of  many 
independent lens parameters, two and three-element lenses have been studied more often than the four- 
element  lenses.  The  four-element  lens  systems  have  been  investigated  experimentally  [33]  and 
theoretically  [34,  35],  and  showed  that  four  element  lenses  are  necessary  to  produce  an  image  at  a 
specific position and magnification. An extensive study including spherical aberration effects has been 
described  in  Refs.  [36]  and  [37]  for  a  variety  configurations  of  four-element  lens  systems  having 
A/D=0.5  where  A  is  the  length  of  the  centre  electrodes  including  half  the  gap  to  each  side.  A  four-
element lens with zoom type which described by Ref. [37] has been used recently in the low energy 
electron-molecule scattering experiments to provide constant image position and magnification [38]. 

B(cid:246)ker et al [39] have presented several different configurations of four-element lens systems operated 
in angular resolving mode. Apart from this dimension, it is also possible to operate these lens systems 
for A/D=1. To our knowledge, this mode has only been mentioned in Ref. [40] but no detailed study 
has  been  performed  yet. We  present  the  focal  properties  of  the  four-element  lenses  having  A/D=0.5 
and 1 with G/D=0.1, and compare the characteristic properties of these two different lens systems. 
 
Based  on  the  concerns  described  above,  in  an  electrostatic  lens  system  quantitative  information  is 
required  over  a  wide  energy  range  and  a  zoom-type  of  optics  is  needed.  If  the  magnification  is  to 
remain  constant  over  a  wide  range  of  energies,  quite  complicated  electrostatic  lens  systems  are 
required, containing three, four, or even more lens elements. Three element lenses can be used to aid 
the design of lenses having fixed image position, but the magnification is not constant. However, the 
four  element  lens  systems  can  be  operated  with  a  constant  magnification  while  keeping  the  image 
position also constant. Electrostatic lens systems with more than four elements are generally used in 
experimental  studies  [43,  44]  to  maintain  a  truly  zoom  lens  with  constant  magnification  overall 
voltage  ratios.  Additionally  five  and  more  element  electrostatic  lenses  can  be  operated  in  the  afocal 
mode which rays incident parallel to the axis leave the lens system still parallel to the axis [45, 46]. 
The focal properties of such multi-element lenses are derived from calculated data of three and four 
element  lenses,  especially  for  afocal  lenses.  In  the  literature,  there  have  been  mainly  two  previous 
studies on the five element lens systems. An experimental study of a five element lens was made by 
Heddle and Papadovassilakis [47] for afocal lens which described by Heddle [45] and for true-zoom 
lens, and Trager-Cowan et al [48] described the behaviour of two five-element lens systems by using 
standard matrix methods and calculated focal properties and spherical aberration coefficients of these 
lenses.  They  have  concentrated  on  a  five-element  lens  system  having  A/D=1.5,  and  calculated 
focusing properties of the lens system. We present the results of a simple analysis of the five-element 
lens  system  having  A/D=0.5  and  1  with  the  help  of  SIMION  and  LENSYS  (Varimag  6  and  8 
procedures)  programs.  Therefore  we  review  the  focal  and  magnification  properties  of  multi-element 
cylindrical  electrostatic  lenses  in  great  detail.  Special  cases  of  lenses,  such  as  zoom  lens,  were  also 
discussed. In addition, voltage ratios, spherical and chromatic aberration coefficients of the resulting 
zoom lens have been evaluated. So, there are much more data in the following, but it is necessary for 
this investigation. 
 
The novelty in this paper is limited, since lenses  of these types have existed  since the  early days of 
electron  microscopy.  However,  there  may  be  scope  for  accurate  numerical  modelling  of  these 
structures using computer-based techniques that were not available to earlier workers.  
 
2.  Determination of axial potential 
 
Calculation of the properties of electrostatic lens systems required knowledge of the potential function, 
V(r), along the whole optical axis. There are four general methods to solve the potential distribution. 
One of these is the Separation of Variables Method (SVM) which is used to solve Laplace(cid:146)s equation 
with cylindrical symmetry. In this method the solution of Laplace(cid:146)s equation is written as a number of 
functions  where  each  function  depends  on  one  variable  only  [9,  15,  16,  18,  24,  49-51].  With  the 
Boundary  Element  Method  (BEM),  or  Charge  Density  Method  (CDM),  the  system  of  electrostatic 
lenses  is  replaced  under  applied  potentials  with  a  system  of  rings  of  charge  that  assumes  the  same 
geometry  as  the  cylinders  [11,  14,  17,  52-55].  The  Finite  Element  Method  (FEM)  is  a  numerical 
technique for obtaining solutions to boundary value problems. This method is used widely to obtain 
the field distribution. The principle of the method is that the potential distribution will be such that the 
potential  energy  of  the  electrostatic  field  is  a  minimum  and  so  this  potential  energy  is  expresses  in 
terms  of  the  potentials  at  the  vertices  of  each  and  all  the  triangular  elements  [56-58].  A  solution  of 
Laplace equation can be found by the Finite Difference Method (FDM). Among the most often used 
are the five-point and nine-point relaxation techniques [59-62].  
 
In this paper we have been assisted in determining focal properties of the electrostatic lens systems by 
SIMION  and  LENSYS  which  is  the  FDM  programs  to  obtain  potential  distribution  and  allow 

visualising  the  trajectories  of  charged  particles.  A  comparison  of  the  accuracy  and  speed  of  FDM 
programs and BEM programs (i.e. CPO [63]) based on these methods can be found in Ref. [64]. 
 
3.  Parameterisation of electrostatic lenses 
 
The focal properties of a lens can be described  by several parameters. Figure 1 shows the geometry 
and  the  focal  points  of  three-element  lens  which  consist  of  three  coaxial  cylinders  of  the  same 
diameter  D,  separated  by  a  distance  G.  The  cylinders  are  at  potentials  V1,  V2  and  V3.  F1  and  F2  are 
mid-focal lengths and the parameters f1 and f2 are the first and second focal lengths. The relationships 
between lens parameters are related through the equation (1) where i is the number of lens elements 
[42].  Other  parameters  are  aberration  coefficients  and  one  type  of  these  is  the  spherical  aberration 
coefficient (CS), where the outer zones of the lens focus more strongly than the inner zones. Another 
type is chromatic aberration coefficient (CC), where charged particles of slightly different energies get 
focused  at  different  image  plane.  Both  types  of  aberrations  can  be  minimised  by  reducing  the 
convergence angle of the system so that the charged particles are confined to the centre of the lenses.

4.  Results and discussions 
 
4.1. Three-element lenses 
 
4.1.1.  The length of the centre electrode 
 
Focal properties of a lens depend on both lens geometry and the voltage ratios. Especially, the length 
of the centre element A/D affects the behaviour of both the magnification and aberration coefficients. 
For this reason, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate dimensions of the lens system. 
 
Three-element lenses are widely used to satisfy the condition of maintaining a zoom lens. One needs 
to  know  the  relationship  between  V2/V1  and  V3/V1,  for  fixed  values  of  the  object  and  the  image 
distance  P/D  and  Q/D.  The  calculated  values  of  some  zoom  lenses  are  shown  in  figure  2,  for  three 
values of A/D=0.5, 1 and 2, for the fixed value of P/D and Q/D, 3.5 and 2.5 respectively. It is shown 
that  as  V3/V1  is  varied,  the  magnification  may  also  vary,  and  the  range  of  the  magnification  for 
A/D=0.5 is less than for A/D=1 and 2. It is shown that this range is 0.4-1 for A/D=0.5 and 0.2-2.2 for 
A/D=2.

constant object and image distance, P/D=3.5 and Q/D=2.5 for A/D=0.5, 1 and 2, respectively. Note that the scale 
of V2/V1 in (a) is shifted one unit. 
 
4.1.2.  Relationship between voltage ratios 
 
In  this  part  we  consider  only  a  three  element  lens  having  A/D=1.  Lens  parameters  have  been 
calculated  over  large  ranges  of  values  V3/V1  and  V2/V1  for  accelerating  (V3/V1>1)  and  decelerating 
(V3/V1<1) mode and are given in figure 3. The second focal length, f2/D can be found equation (1). It 
can be seen that as V2/V1 increases the focal lengths tend to become shorter and to be less dependent 
on V3/V1. In addition to the lens parameters, the spherical and chromatic aberration coefficients have 
been  calculated  (but  not  shown)  for  both  accelerating  and  decelerating  lenses.  The  aberration 
coefficients, Cs/D and Cc/D, for three-element lenses with the higher values V2/V1 are always less than 
the lower values of V2/V1. Because the paths of charged particles with the higher values of V2/V1 in 
the centre of the lens is much closer to the axis. Cs and Cc differ very fast for a given P at the small 
values of V2/V1 and the accelerating lens has a lower coefficient of spherical and chromatic aberration 
than the decelerating lens.

(V3/V1=1/2, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8 and 1/10) lenses having A/D=1 as a functions of V2/V1 for various ratios of V3/V1 (on 
the curves). 
 
4.1.3.  Three- element zoom lens 
 
It  is  possible  to  use  three-element  lenses  as  zoom  lenses.  We  should  know  the  relationship  between 
V2/V1 and V3/V1 for fixed values of P, Q and A. Figure 4 shows these relationship for three different 
values of Q/D (2.8, 4 and 10) and the variation of the magnification of the image distance for P/D=3.5 
and  A/D=1.  On  each  zoom  lens  curve  for  V3/V1=1  two  points  correspond  to  an  einzel  lens  and  for 
V2/V1=1 or V2/V1=V3/V1 four points correspond to a two-element lens.

Figure 4.  Zoom lens curves for various fixed image distance for G/D=0.1 and A/D=1. Showing the relationship 
between V2/V1 and V3/V1 and the variation of the magnification M with V3/V1 for Q/D=2.8, 4 and 10, 
respectively. 
 
The  zoom  lens  condition  for  three-element  lens  having  the  potentials  of  the  second  and  third 
electrodes fixed may be achieved with each of the potentials at a high and low value V2/V1 and V3/V1. 
Figure 5 illustrates the zoom lens properties of the lens in a different way. If the lens is operated with 
V2/V3>1  for  high  mode  the  magnification  M  changes  by  a  small  amount  from  0.74  to  0.88  for 
Q/D=2.8 when the ratio of final to initial energy (V3/V1) is changed from 8 to 0.1, where V2 is altered 
to  keep  the  image  position  constant.  The  four  possible  configurations  lead  to  significantly  different 
coefficients  of  spherical  and  chromatic  aberration  for  all  values  of  the  magnification.  Calculated 
values  of  the  spherical  and  the  chromatic  aberration  coefficient  for  a  range  of  values  of  V2/V1  and 
V3/V1  are  also  shown.  With  its  low  spherical  and  chromatic  aberration  and  small  change  in 
magnification  this  is  obviously  the  better  mode  in  which  to  operate  the  zoom  lens  as  a  variable 
acceleration system. If it is desired to vary magnification then the outer mode of operation in which 
the  centre  electrode  is  at  a  (cid:145)Low(cid:146)  voltage  can  be  used,  although  this  mode  has  inherently  higher 
spherical and chromatic aberration. It was shown that for all values of the magnification, the spherical 
and the chromatic aberration coefficients were least for V2/V1>1 and V3/V1>1, that is (cid:145)High(cid:146) mode.

4.2. Four element lenses 
 
It  is  possible  to  use  four-element  lenses  as  zoom  lenses  and  the  energy  of  the  image  and  its 
magnification  are  constant  during  energy  changing.  It  could  be  an  advantage  to  have  a  lens  which 
could produce an image at a fixed position and magnification. In fact this is probably most important 
for use in experimental studies. 
 
4.2.1.  Focal properties 
 
Martinez  and  Sancho  [36]  have  presented  the  optical  properties  of  the  four-element  lens  having 
A/D=0.5 by using the charge density method. In this work we consider the lens system with A/D=1 
and  our  simulation  programs  use  the  finite  difference  method  to  calculate  the  potential  distribution. 
With these programs we made the similar investigation of treating the lenses and compared the focal 
and zoom lens properties of these two lens systems which have different dimensions.  
  
Calculated values of the first and second mid-focal lengths F1/D and F2/D are shown in figures 6 and 
7, for a range of values V2/V1 from 0.1 to 10, for five different values of V3/V1 from 0.5 to 5, and for 
four different values of V4/V1 from 1 to 10.

Figure 7. Values of the first and second mid-focal length F1/D and F2/D for four-element lenses with A/D=1 as a 
function of V2/V1 for different values of V3/V1 (on the curves) and V4/V1. 
 
The mid-focal lengths, F1/D and F2/D, have the same values when the value of V3/V1 and V4/V1 is near 
to  1.0,  but  as  V3/V1  diverges  from  unity  the  four-element  lens  becomes  stronger.  On  the  other  hand 
since the potential of the final element V4/V1 is taken high values, the lens parameters are independent 
of the voltage fluctuations of V3/V1. These results are very similar to the results of the previous work 
[36]. 
 
4.2.2.  Fixed image position and magnification 
 
For a zoom lens the dependence of M and  the aberration coefficients on the ratio V3/V2 for a given 
overall voltage can be useful design guide and it would be instructive to present the data in this way.  
The  relationship  between  V2/V1  and  V3/V1,  for  fixed  values  of  P/D=2,  and  V4/V1=5,  for  either  Q  is 
constant, or M is constant, is shown in figure 8, for two different values of A/D. In order to test the 
present  method,  we  have  calculated  the  focal  properties  of  the  four-element  lens  with  A/D=0.5  and 
G/D=0.1.  A  few  of  the  obtained  results  are  compared  to  the  previous  ones  (broken  curve)  in  figure 
8(a),  when  the  image  position  is  constant.  It  could  be  seen  that  a  very  good  agreement  with  the 
previous data was achieved.

Figure 8. Zoom lens curves of four-element lenses having A/D=0.5 and 1 for P/D=2 and V4/V1=5, for either Q is 
constant (●) or M is constant (○) (broken curve in (a); Ref. [37]). 
 
If the lens is operated with different cases it can be seen that for Q/D=2 the magnification M changes 
about 1.0 and for Q/D=4 changes about 2.0. Then we are able to determine the most appropriate values 
of M for a given P and Q. 
 
It  can  be  seen  that  there  are  two  crossing  points  which  corresponding  to  Q=2,  M=1  and  two 
corresponding  to  Q/D=4,  M=2  for  two  different  values  of  A/D.  For  other  values  of  V4/V1  we  will 
determine  the  relationship  between  voltage  ratios  for  several  combinations  of  P,  Q  and  M  values. 
However  for  A/D=2  the  magnification  of  the  lens  begins  to  increase  very  strongly  after  particular 
values  of  voltage  ratio  V2/V1.  Because  the  image  position  coincides  with  the  lens  gap  between  the 
third  and  the  final  element  of  the  lens  where  act  of  deviating  of  the  lens  is  very  strong  and  the 
magnification  takes  highest  values.  Then  the  values  of  V2/V1  begin  to  increase  to  provide  constant 
magnification at this region for M=1.  
 

Calculated values of the spherical and the chromatic aberration coefficient of resulting zoom lens for a 
range of values of V2/V1 and V3/V1 are also shown. (cid:145)High(cid:146) mode, which the values of V2/V1 and V3/V1 
are  at  a  high  voltage,  has  the  lowest  spherical  and  chromatic  aberration  coefficients  and  this  is  the 
better  mode  for  using  four-element  lenses  as  a  zoom  lens.  Other  cases  have  inherently  higher 
aberration coefficients, essentially at the lower voltages ((cid:145)Low(cid:146) mode). Of the two four-element lenses 
we  have  studied,  the  lens  having  A/D=0.5  offers  the  advantage  of  a  slightly  wider  range  of 
magnifications compared with A/D=1. 
 
When we compare the spherical and chromatic aberrations for two different values of A/D, it could be 
seen that the aberration coefficients for A/D=1 is lower than A/D=0.5 for the same values of the lens 
parameters. For example the minimum values of Cs for Q=2 are 1.5 and 0.2, and the minimum values 
of Cc are 0.62 and 0.11 for A/D=0.5 and 1, respectively. But for Q=2 the range of the magnification 
for A/D=0.5 is from 0.46 to 1.2, and for A/D=1 is from 0.32 to 2.05.  
 
Similar zoom curves are applied for other values of P and Q to see the effect of the object and image 
distance on the range of the working voltage ratios. But the magnification must be taken different from 
previous  values  because  the  necessary  values  of  the  voltage  ratios  for  Q-M  pairs  do  not  match  for 
different object distances P.  
 
4.2.3.  Constant value of P, Q and M 
 
We calculated the focal parameters of four-element lens systems overall voltage ratios. Now we chose 
six combinations for A/D=0.5 and 1 so that the object position P, image position Q and magnification 
M  are  constant.  This  configuration  will  be  denoted  as  P2Q2M1.  The  properties  of  six  four-element 
lens configurations for each type of lens system are presented here.  
 
There are several crossing points corresponding to constant P, Q and M values for V4/V1=5 in figure 8. 
For other values of V4/V1 we can determine the necessary values of V2/V1 and V3/V1 for combinations 
of P, Q and M values. Martinez et al [37] have chosen the most appropriate combinations of values of 
P,  Q,  and  M,  and  presented  results  for  A/D=0.5.  In  this  paper  we  have  used  their  six  different 
combinations, and applied this parameterisation to the four-element lens having A/D=1 with P  (1) =P 
(0.5) + 1 and Q (1) =Q (0.5) + 1 where the superscript illustrates the value of A/D. Ref. [37] have presented 
the  relationship  between  voltage  ratios  V2/V1,  V3/V1  and  V4/V1  for  only  two  combinations.  We 
calculated results for other combinations for two types of four-element lens system and compared the 
interval of the voltage ratio V4/V1. In addition, the first mid-focal lengths, the spherical and chromatic 
aberration  coefficients  have  been  evaluated  as  a  function  of  V4/V1  for  each  number  of  P,  Q  and  M 
values. This design of figures 9 and 11 might help for charged particle experiments [38]. 
 
The values of the fixed lens parameters for six combinations are given in table 1 and the relationship 
between V2/V1 and V3/V1 as a function of V4/V1 for fixed values of P, Q and M are shown in figure 9 
for two different lens types. The range of the values of V4/V1 includes the magnification is equal to 1.0 
for  four  combinations  and  the  ratio  of  V4/V1  is  greater  than  15  for  three  combinations.  These  latter 
conditions are especially convenient for electron impact studies.

Figure 9.  The relationship between voltage ratios V2/V1 and V3/V1 for A/D=0.5 (a)-(d) and 1 (e)-(h) as a 
function of V4/V1 for six combinations of P-Q-M specified in table 1. 
 
As can be concluded from figure 9, the range of ratio V4/V1 is limited for a given P, Q and M values. 
Beyond this limit of V4/V1 a focusing condition cannot be achieved for any pair of voltages V2/V1 and 
V3/V1 and focus point lies outside the image plane. For P2Q3M1 and P3Q4M1 (defined number 2) the 
voltage  ratios  V2/V1  and  V3/V1  change  in  an  opposite  way  for  two  lens  systems  A/D=0.5  and  1. 
Because  for  A/D=0.5  the  ratios  of  V2/V1  and  V3/V1  have  negative  values  to  provide  the  focus 
condition  with  constant  M.  The  range  of  the  values  of  V4/V1  for  A/D=1  includes  V4/V1=1.0.  Other 
combinations are very similar.

Figure 10.  Values of the first mid-focal lengths F1/D for four-element lenses with A/D=0.5 (a-b) and 1 (c-d) as 
a function of V4/V1 for six combinations of P, Q and M. 
 
We show the first mid-focal length F1/D as a function of V4/V1 in figure 10 for six combinations of 
A/D=0.5 and 1. It is important that the focal length of a lens does not depend on P and Q or M, but on 
cylinder  lengths  and  potentials.  However,  the  potentials  of  the  lens  are  changed  to  provide  constant 
values  of  P, Q  and  M.  So,  the  focal  lengths  (f1,  f2, F1  and  F2)  may vary  if  the  potentials  of  the  lens 
element are not constant. Other lens parameters (F2/D, f1/D and f2/D) can be obtained from equation 
(1) for a fixed value of P, Q and M. The calculated values of the spherical and chromatic aberration 
coefficients  are  shown  in  figure  11  as  a  function  of  V4/V1  for  each  of  the  six  combinations.  Under 
these  conditions  it  is  possible  to  use  a  four-element  lens  as  the  spherical  and  chromatic  aberration 
coefficients are then smaller for a given focusing conditions.

4.3. Five-element lenses 
 
This part is a simple analysis using LENSYS and SIMION of the standard five-element lens of total 
length 6 and 8 D. A schematic view of a five element lens system with the lens parameters is shown in 
figure  12.  The  unit  of  distance  is  the  cylinder  diameter  D  and  the  gap  between  two  cylinders  is 
G=0.1D. The lengths of the lens elements discussed here are given in table 2. To prevent confusion of 
terms we have referred to these lens systems as A/D=0.5 and 1. The dependences of voltage ratios on 
magnification and aberration coefficients are presented graphically for two modes of five-element lens 
systems, true and afocal zoom lens modes.

For the true zoom lenses, to form a focal point of electrons with the same starting angle, an optimized 
relationship between the voltages V2/V1 and V4/V1 has to be calculated for a given voltage ratio V5/V1 
of  final  to  initial  electron  energy.  The  zoom  lens  condition  for  five-element  lenses  having  the 
potentials of these  middle  electrodes  may be achieved with each of the potentials at a high and low 
value.  It  is  practical  importance  that  the  cases  with  V2/V1>1  and  V4/V1>1  have  smaller  aberration 
coefficients. Then other cases have higher spherical and chromatic aberrations [47, 48]. Some example 
of  calculated  values  of  V2/V1  and  V4/V1  are  shown  with  the  spherical  and  chromatic  aberration 
coefficients, Cs/D and Cc/D, in figure 13 for V5/V1=0.1, 1 and 10 with V3/V1= (V5/V1)1/2, for two types 
of lens system A/D=0.5 and 1. Similar curves can apply for other values of V5/V1.

Figure 13. Values of V2/V1 and V4/V1, and the variation of V2/V4 which contains two voltage ratios of middle 
electrodes as a function of the magnification for the five element lens systems having A/D=1 and 0.5 with the 
spherical and chromatic aberration coefficients, Cs/D and Cc/D, for three different values of V5/V1. Note that the 
scale of V2/V1 and V4/V1 is shifted two units for A/D=0.5.  
 
The  dependences  of  the  ratio  V2/V4  on  the  magnification  for  two  type  of  lens  system  are  shown  in 
figure 13. It can be seen that for three value of V2/V4, there are only one point corresponding to the 
magnification and for other values two points corresponding to M. For a given value of V5/V1, one of 
these three points is the crossing point on the curve, and other points are upper and lower bound of the 
zoom lens. It is important that the crossing point on figure 13(d) shows the required voltage ratios for 
afocal lenses. In the afocal zoom lens mode to produce a final beam angle of zero at infinity, the lenses 
are arranged so that the second focal point of the first three-element lens (F2) coincides with the first 
focal point of the second lens (F1). Therefore the magnification is independent of the object and image 
positions  and  is  determined  by  the  overall  voltage  ratios.  The  conditions  of  (cid:147)afocal  zoom(cid:148)  lens  are 
given in the following equations with M= (V5/V1)-1/4.

V5/V1=0.1, 1 and 10. For other values of V5/V1 we can determine the necessary values of V2/V1 and 
V4/V1  with  the  constant  magnification.  Therefore  five-element  lens  system  can  be  operated  to  give 
constant magnification overall voltage ratio. By a simple calculation of the various voltage ratios and 
magnification, a diagram showing that the lines of the constant parameters can be generated, where we 
used the notation of Ref. [47], and additionally with aberration effect. In this way figure 15 illustrate 
the calculated values of voltage ratios and spherical aberration coefficient in terms of M and V5/V1, for 
two types of lens systems. The range of the magnification is from 0.4 to 3, and for V5/V1 it is from 
0.04 to 70. These conditions are especially convenient for low and high energy electron spectroscopy.

5.  Conclusions 
 
In this paper we reviewed the properties of multi-element cylinder lenses. We started with a discussion 
of the criteria for choosing the most appropriate dimensions of the lens elements for the lens systems, 
and  then  presented  results  of  three-element  lenses  with  the  zoom-lens  and  acceleration/deceleration-
lens  mode.  The  required  dependencies  of  the  voltage  ratios  and  aberration  coefficients  of  resulting 
zoom lens are presented. Therefore the characteristics of the three-element lens have been determined. 
 
Secondly,  two  types  of  four-element  lens  systems  have  been  investigated  in  great  detail.  Focal 
parameters,  zoom  lens  properties  and  aberration  coefficients  have  been  calculated  for  six  different 
configurations of these lens systems. It is shown that a higher value of V2/V1 and V3/V1 has the lowest 
spherical  and  chromatic  aberration  coefficients  and  other  cases  have  higher  spherical  and  chromatic 
aberration  coefficients,  and  additionally  the  greater  the  object  distance  P  the  wider  the  aberration 
coefficients for a given ratio V4/V1 allowing a focal point at the image plane. A few of the obtained 
results are compared to the previous studies [36, 37] and a very good agreement with the previous data 
was achieved.  

 
Finally, the five-element lens systems have been investigated with true and afocal zoom lens modes, 
and  the  required  voltage  ratios  and  magnification  of  lens  systems  have  been  performed  over  a  wide 
energy  range.  It  is  shown  that  the  range  of  magnification  of  any  given  four-element  lens  is  quite 
limited  when  it  is  compared  with  the  five-element  afocal  case.  An  important  conclusion  from  the 
calculations the computer based techniques can be used for accurate modelling of multi-element lens 
systems.

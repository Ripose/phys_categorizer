Abstract 

We  are  using  a  laser  pointer  as  a  light  source,  and  metersticks  as  an  optical 
branch  and  the  screen  for  wave  optics  experiments.  It  is  shown  the  setup  for 
measurements of wavelength of laser light and rating radial spacing of the CD, 
diffraction  on  a  wire  and  a  slit,  observation  of  a  polarization  of  light  and 
observation of a hologram. 

1.  Introduction 

Laser  pointers  also  know  as  laser  penlights,  have  become  very  affordable  recently  due  to  new 
developments  in  laser  technology.  They  are  widely  available  at  electronic  stores,  novelty  shops, 
through  mail  order  catalogs  and  by  numerous  other  sources. They  are in the  price range from $1 to 
$30 as other electronic toys and are being treated as such by many parents and children. Pointers are 
used for other purposes such as the aligning of other lasers, laying pipes in construction, and as aiming 
devices for firearms. 

Laser pointer can be use to observe the interference, diffraction and polarization of light in college 
physics laboratory. Laser pointers can be used to produce holograms[1-2]. It been opinions it couldn't be 
done because of the short coherence of the beam and that laser pointer’s beam was not polarized. But 
it  was  practically  proved  that  a  laser  pointer  could  be  used  not  only  to  observe  a  hologram  but  to 
produce a high quality transmission and reflection display hologram[1-3]. 

We  suggested  a  series  of  classic  experiments  with  a  laser  pointer  as  a  light  source,  and  using 
metersticks  as  an  optical  branch  and  the  screen to measure the  interference and  diffraction patterns. 
The detail procedures of suggested experiments are given in Ref. 4. 

2.  Determination of wavelength of laser Light 

A wave phenomenon, which occurs when two or more waves overlap in the same region of space 
at the same time and form an interference pattern, is known as the interference of waves. When two 
waves of the same frequency but of different phases combine, the resultant wave is a wave of the same 
frequency, the amplitude of which depends on the phase difference. If the phase difference is 0 or an

integer times 2π, the waves are in phase and interfere constructively. For the constructive interference, 
the resultant amplitude equals the sum of the individual amplitudes, and the intensity has a maximum.  
If  the  phase  difference  is  π  or  any  odd  integer  times  π,  the  waves  are  out  of  phase  and  interfere 
destructively.  For  destructive  interference  the  resultant  amplitude  is  the  difference  between  the

the destructive interference results in the zero net amplitude. The phase difference between two waves 
is often the result of difference in path length traveled by the two waves. If waves from two sources 
with  the  same  wavelength  arrive  at  the  same  point  together  with  exactly  the  same  phase,  then  the 
condition for maximum constructive interference is that the path length of two waves must be identical 
or else differ by an integer multiple of the wavelength, that is

where  D1  and  D2  are  the  path  lengths  of  the  waves  from  their  source  to  the  point  P  (Fig.  1).  If  the 
distances D1 and D2 are quite large compared to the separation d between the sources, we can write the 
conditions for the constructive and destructive interferences in terms of the angle θ and the distance of 
separation d. When the distance d between the light sources and the plane containing the observation 
point  is  much  greater  than  L,  two  paths  D1  and  D2  are  nearly  parallel  and  the  path  difference  is 
, as shown in Fig.1. This result gives equation for determining the constructive 
approximately 
interference of the resultant wave at point P:

As it is shown in Fig. 1, the distance ym measured along the screen from the central bright point to the 
mth bright fringe is related to the angle θ  by

Thus, for the known distance of separation d, by measuring the distance ym along the screen from the 
central bright point to each of the mth bright fringe and the distance L from the slit to the screen, we 
can determine the wavelength of the monochromatic light. We determine the wavelength of the laser 
light  using  diffraction  grating.  In  the  first  part  of  this  experimental  activity  we  will  be  using  a 
monochromatic  laser  beam,  which  is  incident  normally  on  a  transmission  diffraction  grating.  By 
observing the interference pattern and measuring the distances ym between the central bright maximum 
and each of the mth bright fringe and the distance L from the diffraction grating to the screen, we will 
determine the wavelength of the laser light from equation (5).

Equation (6) allows us to determine the distance of separation between the light sources. That means 
we  can  find  a  grating  spacing  by  using  a  light  source  of  a  known  wavelength  and  measuring  the

distance  ym  along  the  screen  from  the  central  bright  point  to  each  of  the  mth  bright  fringe  and  the 
distance L from the slit to the screen. 

The  rainbow-colored  reflections  that  you  can  see  from  the  surface  of  a  CD  are  the  reflection 
grating  effects.  The  grooves  are  tiny  pits  0.1  µm  deep  on  the  surface  of  the  disc,  with  the  uniform 
radial spacing of d=1.6 µm. The reflection grating aspect of the CD is merely an aesthetic side benefit. 
The interference pattern produced on the screen on a large distance from the grating is due to a large 
number of equally spaced light sources. The interference maxima are at the angle θ given by equation 

(3). In this part of the experiment the monochromatic laser beam will incident normally on a reflection 
diffraction  grating.  We  will  be  using  a  CD  as  the  reflection  diffraction  grating.    By  measuring  the 
distances  ym  between  the  central  bright  maximum  and  each  of  the  mth  bright  fringe,  the  distance  L 
from  the  CD  to  the  screen  and  using  the  wavelength  of  the  laser  light  found  previously,  we  will 
determine the grating radial spacing of the CD from equation (6).

diffracted  spots  are  projected  on  a  meterstick-screen  as  it  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  laser  beam  is 
assumed  to be very parallel rays of light, which means that the waves are plane light waves, passes 
though a slit. Plane waves are diffracted by the slit and light rays fall on the screen, which is very far 
away, so the rays heading for any point are very nearly parallel before they meet at the screen. This 
approximates the conditions for Fraunhofer diffraction. At the screen a central bright region is formed 
and a series of symmetrical dark and bright fringes can be observed.  A general condition for a dark 
fridge of the diffraction pattern is

on  bright  fringes  occurring  on  both  side  of  the  central  maximum.  However,  the  intensity  of  those 
maxima  diminish  more  rapidly.  From  the  Fig.  4  we  see  that  for  the  small  angle θm  we  can  replace 
sinθm  by the expression

where  dm  is  the  distance  between  two  symmetrical  dark  fringes  of  the  same  order  m,  and  L  is  a 
distance between the wire and the screen. Substitution of equation (8) into equation (7) gives the width

Therefore,  we  can  find  the  width  of  very  narrow  slit  by  measuring  the  distances  dm  between  two 
symmetrical dark fringes of the same order m, and the distance L.

Now  let  us  consider  the  diffraction  on  an  obstacle.  Replace  the  narrow  slit  slide  by  a  wire 
holding slide. You can observe the diffraction pattern. The central bright fringe occurring at θ=0 and is 
the  brightest,  secondary  and  so  on  bright  fringes  occurring  on  both  side  of  the  central  maximum.  A

where a is the diameter of a wire and θm is the angle between the position of the bright fringe of m 
order and central bright fringe. We can determine the diameter of the wire using equation (10) and as a 
result it will be yield to equation (9) only now distance dm  is the distance between two symmetrical 
bright fringes of the same order m.  Thus, we can find the diameter of the thin wire by measuring the 
distances dm between two symmetrical bright fringes of the same order m, and the distance L. In this 
experiment using a laser pointer you can observe the sharp diffraction pattern for the wire of the gages 
from 34 to 48 (0.16 -0.03 mm).

transmits half of an intensity of the

absorbed by the polarizer. This fact 
is  known  as  the  one-half  rule.  We 
can use this rule only when the light 
reaching

unpolarized.  If  the  light  is  linearly 
polarized when it is incident on the 
second  polarizer,  as  in  Fig.6,  then 
the  second  polarizer  examines  or 
analyzes  the  incoming  light  and  can  tell  us  something  about  the  nature  of  this  polarized  light.  The 
second polarizing material thus called an analyzer. In other words, when two polarizing materials are 
placed in succession in a beam of light as on Fig.6, the first is called the polarizer and the second - the

amplitude  of  the  electric  field  of  the  light  is  reduced  by  the  second  polarizer  (analyzer)  by  factor 
.  Since  the  intensity  of  the  light,  which  is  the  energy  transmitted  per  unit  time  and  area,  is

approximately  1  m  (the  distance  depends  on  the  focal  length  of  the  diverging  lens)  to  get  uniform 
illumination.

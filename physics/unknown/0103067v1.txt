Phantom of Higgs Boson Versus Hierarchy of Stationary 
States of Superhigh Energies. 

 
ABSTRACT 

 
As  is  known,  the  Standard  Model  mainly  ideologically  and 
qualitatively focuss the experimenters in their search of new mass 
states  (of  EP-  elementary  particles).  The  exact  quantitative 
prognosis  of  their  properties,  especially  of  masses,  lays  outside 
opportunities of the usual theory.  

Model  of  Stationary  states  of  EP  within  the  framework  of  the 
Wave  Universe  Concept  [Chechelnitsky,  1980-2001]  points  on 
existence of Hierarchy of physically distinguished - stationary (elite, 
dominant) states described by the mass formulas, in particular, in a 
range 10‚ 210 Gev/c2: 

The  states  close  to…,  101.5;  107.3;  112.76‚ 113;  139.5‚ 143; 

147.6; 202 Gev/c2 should be observed. 

      Apparently,  the  experiment  already  confirms  this  prognosis 
in a range up to 100 Gev/c2. You see preferable states, observable 
already now in experiment, it - not rejected by the usual theory as 
the candidates in constituents of Standard model (for example, not 
holding Higgs bosons), but quite real displays of stationary (first of 
all, - dominant) mass states.  

      Last data of L3 (CERN) Collaboration really specify displays 

of new mass states and close to 103.7; 108.9; 114.5 Gev/c2.

RANGE 12-210 Gev/c2: "GREAT DESERT"? 

On  a  boundary  of  centuries  formed  in  physics  of  high 
energies  situation  is  characterized  by  some  remarkable 
circumstances: 

#  According  to  prevailing  representations  of  Standard 
model  the  extreme  efforts  of  physical  community  are  still 
concentrated  on  search  and  judgement  of  postulated  basic 
constituents  of  the  theory  –  of  bosons,  realizing  weak 
interaction (Z0 - neutral currents, W–  - charged currents) and 
of  Higgs  bosons

  By  virtue  of  a  similar  sort  of  the  factors,  traditions  and 
preferences in representation of physical community there is 
a following picture of HEP on a boundary of centuries. 

# From 10 up to 210 Gev/c2 and, probably, further “Great

#  Till  now  fruitless  search  of  Higgs  boson  is  conducted 

(for the present). 

#  But  still  adepts  of  Standard  model  are  complete  of 
optimism.  As  is  known,  -  the  theorists  frequently  are 
mistaken, but never doubt. 
 
Crisis of Belief. 

We suppose, that such picture, dictating by preferences of 
the prevailing theory, in many respects, will disorient not only 
theorists, but, main, - the experimenters conducting intense, 
extremely difficult search in a rich fog of unverified opinions, 
were guided only by assurances of authorities. 

The situation too obviously reminds fantastic "Go there - I 
do  not  know  where".  But  main,  -  the  dominated  dogmas  of 
habitual  representations  extremely  narrow  prospects  of 
experimental search. 

There  is  a  hunt  only  at  widely  known  Phantoms  of  the 

prevailing theory. 

Other Horizons. 

Other prospects are offered by system of representations 
connected  with  Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU  Concept) 
[Chechelnitsky (1978) 1980-2000]. 

As against Standard model not capable to point  exactly, 
for  example,  localization  of  new  states  on  a  scale  of  mass, 
the offers of WU Concept are rather critical. 

The  offered  mass  spectrum  of  new  stationary  states 
[Chechelnitsky,  2000]  is  quite  certain  and  is  unequivocal.  It 
can  be  veryfied-  confirmed  or  denied  by  an obvious way by 
experiment. 

Panorama Represented by an G[2] Shell. 

The  picture  offered  by  WU  Concept  for  forward  edge  of 

HEP is rather certain [see also Chechelnitsky, 2000]. 

#  There  is  a  whole  set  of  physically  distinguished  -  elite 
(among  them  -  strongest  -  dominant)  states  in  area  of 
masses 

M = 10 - 210 Gev/c2. 

# This cluster of stationary states we shall present by an

The  spectrum  of  potentially  arising  mass  configurations,

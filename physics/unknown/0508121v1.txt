      We present the MCSCF version of density functional theory.      Two sets of equations, which correspond to the CI 

and orbital relaxation respectively, are derived.    An important feature is that the correlation potential of DFT for CI 

wavefunction and that  for orbitals are different to each other.      These relations ensure that  a density yielded by an 

effective MCSCF solution also satisfies the Euler equation of DFT.

Introduction 

          The Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) [1,2] is now a powerful tool in computational chemistry.     

But it is known that it does not work well for near degeneracy of several configurations.        In particular, the density 

that is not noninteracting v-representable is beyond the scope of KS-DFT [3].          Since this defect is due to not only 

the approximation of exchange-correlation functional but also the single determinant feature of KS-DFT, one possible 

remedy is to revive a multireference (MR) wavefucntion (WF) and to combine it with DFT.      The first generation to 

merge MR-WF and DFT remains a double counting problem of electron correlation [4].      Although the prescription to 

cover the electron correlation by KS-DFT is quite different to that of the MR-WF theory, recent developers resolve this 

problem by various ways [5,6].        The definition of the spin-polarizability for a singlet MR-WF is also refined from the 

computational viewpoint [7]. 

            As  another  direction,  recent  developments  of  MR-DFT  are  obviously  towards  the  multireference  version  of 

density functional theory.        Kusakabe introduced MR-WF in order to define the universal functional of the partially 

interacting  system  [8],  deriving  the  set  of  equations  called  “the  extended  KS-DFT  (EKS-DFT)”.      Savin  and  his 

co-workers have developed such a MR-DFT based on adiabatic connection by dividing the Coulomb interaction term in 

Hamiltonian  into  the  short-range  and  long-range  interaction  [6].        We  have  recently  developed  an  iterative 

CASCI-DFT  (ICASCI-DFT)  method  [9].      The  mathematical  framework  of  ICASCI-DFT  is  given  by  a  CASCI 

equation with a residual correlation potential, so its variational space of ICASCI-DFT is same to that of the CASCI 

approach.      In addition, from the computational point of view, the orbital transformation procedure is skipped except 

that in the first cycle.        Nevertheless, we can handle both nondynamical and dynamical correlation effects.     

          However, when an appropriate set of molecular orbitals is not available, the orbital relaxation procedure becomes 

essential to obtain the good density.      Thus, in this study, we present the general formulation of the MCSCF-DFT.         

Roos  and  his  co-workers  have  developed  a  precursive  approach  in  this  line  [10].        They  intend  to  add  a  total 

correction of DFT to CASSCF wavefunction approach that is pioneered by them, in order to obtain the any physical 

properties.      This  is  a  straightforward  and  probably  powerful  way  to  realize  the  CASSCF-DFT  approach.        The 

different point of our formalism compared with them is that the emphasis of our formalism is on the multireference 

implementation of DFT, in other words, the equivalent formalism of the Euler equation, which is the original equation of 

DFT.        This  spirit  is  of  EKS  theory,  and  leads  us  to  our  original  relation  between  correlation  functional  and  its 

potential given below.       

Effective CI equation for MR-DFT 

        We start from the division of the energy into three parts, 

where  first,  second,  and  third  terms  in  parenthesis  at  the  right  side  are  the  modified  universal  functional    residual 

correlation,  and  external  potential  terms,  respectively.        The  modified  universal  functional  is  defined  for  the 

variational space of MCSCF wavefunctions: 

  The variation of CI coefficients lead to the equation   

, 

(1a) 

. 

(1b) 

 

(1c) 

 

 

 

 

 

where

, 

, 

  are the core Hamiltonian, a spinless-one particle density matrix (1-DM), a spinless 

two-particle density matrix (2-DM), respectively, and the physicists’ notation is used for electron-repulsion integrals.     

Here it is arbitrary whether the two-electron integrals are of atomic orbitals or of molecular orbitals.      We here assume 

the latter, according to the usual convention of the MR-WF formalism [11].      It should be noted that the deviation 

given in eq.(1c) is limited within the specific MCSCF variational space.      We now intend to formulate the effective 

multireference equation in the form of 

E!r()[]=Min!r()"NFp!r()[]+ERC!r()[]+dr!r()Vextr()#[]Fp!r()[]=Min"#!r()p"ˆ T +ˆ V ee"!E"r()[]=Hjicore!Pijij#+klij!$ijklijkl#+dr!ERC!"r()%!"r()=Hjicore!Pijij#+klij!$ijklijkl#+i!ERC!"j!Pjiij#HjicorePji!ijklThe effective energy is thus given by, 

. 

(2a) 

. 

(2b) 

The deviation of the effective energy due to the variation of CI coefficients is given by 

The effective CI wavefucntion for the ground state is obtained by the relation, 

Comparing eq. (2b) with (1c), we found that if we set   

 

 

, 

the Euler equation is satisfied by the solution of effective MR-DFT given by eq. (2a).       

      To prove this relation, all we need is to substitute eqs. (3) into eq. (2c): 

. (2c) 

. 

(2d) 

(3a) 

(3b)

with   

Here, we use the fact that the deviation of density is given by 

,

The equation proved above means that if we obtain the ground-state solution of 

the effective CI equations (2a-c), the Euler equation for eq. (1a-c) is satisfied.                                                                         

      Therefore, the system of equations given above can be an alternative of the Kohn-Sham DFT.      In particular, the 

relation given by eq. (3c) is an original part in the iterative CASCI equation. 

Effective one-particle equation for MR-DFT 

        In the formulation of MCSCF-DFT, the problem that concerns us now is the variational procedure for molecular 

orbitals.        The mathematical (not computational) formulation can be archived by a straightforward manner as follows.     

The first order deviation of the real system is given by 

The deviation of the effective MCSCF energy is   

which  is  obviously  equivalent  to  eq.  (5)  by  noting  the  relations  given  by  eq.  (3).      This  fact  can  be  confirmed  as

follows: 

Note that we here consider the deviations of MOs only, so

The above equation indicates the equivalence between 

  and 

  for this density deviation. 

            The usual treatment of this equation [11] yields the effective one-electron problem: 

 

 

 

(7a) 

(7b) 

(7c) 

(7d) 

. 

Note that the correlation potential for the MCSCF orbitals takes the form similar to that of KS-DFT as 

This  is  different  to  that  for 

: 

  corresponds  to  correlation  energy  per  particle  while 

  to 

correlation potential in the context of KS-DFT. 

      The set of those equation described here is the fundamental equations of MCSCF-DFT. 

      The algorithm of MCSCF-DFT is as follows: 

(i) Set initial MOs and 1-DM. 

(ii) Transform integrals to that with the given MOs’ basis. 

(iii) Compute 

. 

(iv) Compute 

. 

(iii) Solve the CASCI-DFT (effective CASCI) equation using 

  to update 1-DM. 

(v) Solve the CASSCF-DFT (effective one-particle) equation using

  to update MOs 

(vi) If MOs and 1-DM are converged, the computation is completed. Otherwise go back to (ii). 

      A CASSCF-DFT is a specific version of MCSCF-DFT.    The difference between a CASSCF-DFT and a MCSCF 

is the definition of a residual correlation given by DFT.      The computational results are presented elsewhere.

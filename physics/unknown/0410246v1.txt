Abstract: This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive study of noise 
statistics  by  use  of  probability  density  function  (pdf)  for  DPSK  receivers  with 
optical  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  (MZI)  demodulation,  considering  the 
impact  of  signal-amplified  spontaneous  emission  (ASE)  beat  noise,  ASE-ASE 
beat noise, and phase noise. We further evaluate the error performance of DPSK 
receivers by using the pdf’s and found that balanced detection is less sensitive to 
phase noise impact than the single-port detection.

1.  Introduction 
 
In order to utilize the transmission bandwidth more efficiently and to increase the aggregated 
capacity, the bit rates of 40 Gb/s and beyond per channel with the channel space of ≤ 50 GHz 
are  attractive  for  applications  into  long-haul  and  ultra  long-haul  wavelength  division 
multiplexing  (WDM)  transmission  systems.  However,  for  such  systems  with  the  traditional 
intensity  modulation/direct  detection  (IM/DD),  it  has  been  found  that  several  impairments, 
such  as  cross-phase  modulation,  inter-  and  intra-channel  crosstalk  and  optical  filtering  etc., 
become  very  severe  and  significantly  degrade  the  transmission  performance.  In  order  to 
suppress  these  impairments,  several  novel  modulation  formats  have  been  proposed  and 
investigated,  such  as 
return-to-zero,  carrier-suppressed 
return-to-zero,  duobinary,  and  differential  phase-shift  keying  (DPSK),  etc.  Among  these 
modulation  formats,  DPSK  has  attracted  great  attention  and  been  investigated  extensively 

the  carrier-suppressed  non

[1-23].  This  is  because  DPSK  has  several  advantages  over  IM/DD:  DPSK  can  provide 
additional  3-dB  receiver  sensitivity  or  Q  factor  [1-4],  and  is  more  tolerant  of  signal  power 
fluctuation,  in-band  crosstalking  [5],  nonlinear  polarization  fluctuation  [6]  and  optical 
filtering [7]. 

DPSK  receivers  with  coherent  detection  (homodyne  and  heterodyne)  and  electrical 
demodulation  (referred  to  as  conventional  DPSK  receivers)  were  investigated  extensively 
[24-27].  However,  DPSK  with  optical  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  (MZI)  demodulated 
receivers  (referred  to  as  DPSK/MZI  receivers)  is  different  from  the  conventional  DPSK 
receivers in the physical processing of signal and noise. In the conventional DPSK receivers, 
the  electrical  demodulation  is  after  optical  detection,  and  DPSK/MZI  receivers  have  the 
demodulation before the optical detection. This implies that the theory in [24-27] could not be 
directly applied for the DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection.   

In  order  to  analyze  the  performance  of  DPSK  systems,  it  is  essential  to  know  the 
probability  density  function  (pdf)  of  noise  statistics  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers.  However,  the 
noise  statistics  in  optically  pre-amplified  DPSK/MZI  receivers  have  not  been  fully 
investigated and understood theoretically. So far, either noise statistics of the phase noise or 
the  amplified  spontaneous  emission  noise  (ASE)  is  investigated  separately  [7,13,  28-35].  A 
comprehensive analysis is needed to explore the noise statistics of DPSK/MZI receivers. 

 

2.    Noise Statistics in DPSK/MZI Receivers   
 

Since  the  MZI  before  the  optical  detector  converts  the  phase  modulated  optical  signal 
into  intensity-modulated  signal,  the  optical  detection  and  electrical  processing  in  DPSK 
receivers are the same as those in IM/DD receivers. Then, similar to optically pre-amplified 
IM/DD receivers [39-40] the shot noise, thermal noise, signal-ASE beat noise, and ASE-ASE 
beat noise (besides the phase noise) are involved in optically pre-amplified DPSK receivers. 
The phase noise may come from laser phase noise, quadrature component of ASE noise and 
nonlinear  phase  noise.  In  this  work,  we  intend  to  analyze  the  pdf’s  of  noise  statistics  in 
optically pre-amplified DPSK/MZI receivers with single port and balanced detection. Due to 
the fact that the shot noise and thermal noise are negligibly small compared to the signal-ASE 
beat  noise  and  ASE-ASE  beat  noise  in  optically  pre-amplified  receivers,  these  two  noise 
contributions are not considered here.

Fig.1:    Basic block structure of optically pre-amplified DPSK/MZI receivers.   

 
Fig. 1 depicts the schematic structure of DPSK/MZI receivers. Compared to IM/DD receivers, 
the only difference is that a MZI demodulator is inserted before the optical detector, and the 
MZI is a special optical filter. DPSK/MZI receivers with constructive port, destructive port, 
and balanced detection are corresponding to the structure shown in Fig.1 with the black, gray, 
and both photodiodes together, respectively.   

Assuming that two power splitters of the MZI are ideal and have the exact 3-dB splitting 
power ratio, we can obtain a relation of the electric fields between input and output ports of

Now we analyze the impact of the phase noise on pdf’s. For DPSK/MZI receivers with 
= , 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 
constructive port detection, we illustrate the pdf’s in Fig. 4 for 
radians. It is obvious that the pdf for bit “0” is very sensitive to phase noise; and in contrast 
the pdf for bit “1” is much less sensitive to phase noise (two pdf’s for 
= , and 0.1 are 
not distinguishable for bit “1” in Fig. 4). Moreover, as 
  increases, the cross point of bits 
“1”  and  “0”  pdf’s  is  increased  due  to  the  phase  noise’s  influence  on  the  pdf  of  bit  “0”. 
Furthermore,  the  optimal  decision  threshold  is  very  sensitive  to  the  phase  noise.  Since 
DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  constructive  and  destructive  port  detection  are  almost  the  same 
except  a  slight  difference  in  the  ASE-ASE  beat  noise,  the  behavior  of  the  phase  noise 
influence on the pdf’s for the destructive port detection is expected to be very similar to that 
for constructive port detection.

For DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection, the pdf’s are presented in Fig. 5. The 
shape  of  the  pdf’s  in  Fig.  5  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  measured  one  [43].  Due  to  the 
symmetry of the pdf’s of bits “1” and “0”, the impact of phase noise on the pdf’s are the same 
for both the bit “1” and “0”. Consequently, we can expect, to some extent, that the influence 
of  the  phase  noise  on  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  is  less  than  that  on

In  this  section,  we  use  the  cumulative  probability  (CP)  to  evaluate  the  performance  of

and  “0”,  and 
  is  the  optimal  decision  threshold  of  the  detection  currents.  The  CP  is 
considered as the bit error ratio (BER) in IM/DD [37-40] and DPSK/MZI receivers [7, 9, 13, 
15, 29-30, 34-37]. 

Fig.  6  shows  the  CP  for  IM/DD  receivers  (red),  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  constructive 
port detection (blue) and destructive port detection (black) with the use of pdf’s. The results in 
Fig. 6  are  in  good  agreement  with  those  in Ref.  [35]  where  the  performance  of DPSK/MZI 
receivers  with  constructive  and  destructive  port  detection  is  not  identical.  Again,  the 
performance difference is due to the ASE-ASE beat noise in the two receivers. 
The performance comparison of DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection to IM/DD 
 
receivers  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  7.  It  is  observed  that  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced 
detection  have  ~3  dB  improvement  of  optical  receiver  sensitivity  compared  to  IM/DD 
receivers  for  the  same  CP.  This  agrees  well  with  the  results  in  [7,  35,  37]  even  though  the 
procedures  of  calculations  are  quite  different  from  this  work,  which  verifies  that  our 
calculated pdf’s for balanced detection is correct and accurate. Our further calculations have 
shown  that  the  receiver  sensitivity  improvement  for  balanced  detection  over  single  port 
B B   is  increased,  and  then  completely  vanished  at  a 
detector  decreased  as  the  factor  of 
high ration of 

B B . This finding, again, agrees well with the observations in Refs. [7, 37].

  as  well.  Then,  there  is  about  the  same  upper  limit  of  phase  noise 
occurs  when

However,  the  receiver  with  balanced  detection  is  less  sensitive  to  the  phase  noise  than  that 
with single port detection if below the upper limit.

5.    Conclusions 
 
We have presented a comprehensive analysis of noise statistics by use of pdf’s for DPSK/MZI 
receivers with constructive, destructive port and balanced detection, considering the impact of 
signal-ASE beat noise, ASE-ASE beat noise, and phase noise.   

We  have  found  that,  if  the  standard  deviation  of  differential  phase  noise  is  0.4  radians 
and beyond, the similar noise floor occurs for both single port and balanced detection. On the 
other  hand,  it  is  also  shown  that  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  are  less 
sensitive to phase noise than single port detection if below 0.4 radians. 

 

Reviewer 1 comments: 
 
This paper adds relatively little to the existing literature on the topic of the nonlinear phase 
noise in DPSK-format lightwave systems. It also has a number of incorrect statements. It is 
recommended that this paper should not be accepted in Optics Express. 
 

Reviewer 2 comments: 
 
The paper should be rejected because it does not provide any new understanding to the problem 
about the performance of DPSK signal with nonlinear phase noise when interferometer is used 
at the receiver. It seems that the authors do not fully understand the mathematics behind the 
problem.

First of all, in the third pages, the last two paragraphs of Section 1 are totally wrong. If the 
authors are not able to appreciate and understand the results of other previous literatures, I 
really don&#146;t know that they are able to handle the mathematics of the problems correctly. 
 
1.      The authors said that &#147;the theory in [24-27] could not be directly applied for the 
DPSK/MZI receivers&#148;. Please note that the title of [25] is &#147;Equivalence between 
pre-amplified direct detection and heterodyne receivers&#148;. For two mathematically 
equivalence problems, the theory is [24-27] certainly can directly applied for the DPSK/MZI 
receivers. The authors must first prove that the paper of [25] is wrong. Unfortunately, there is 
no effort by the author to clarify this confusion.   
 
2.        The authors also said that &#147;So far, either noise statistics of the phase noise or the 
amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE) is investigated separately [7,13, 28-35]&#148;. 
Some of those papers calculate the error probability, may be using simplification or 
approximation. In order to calculate the error probability, both ASE and phase noise should be 
taken into account.   
 
With all papers of [24-27] and [7, 13, 28-35], I don&#146;t believe that the current paper 
contributes anything new to the topic. About the phase noise, some of those previous papers 
consider phase noise to be non-Gaussian distributed, as confirmed by measurement. The 
current paper compares the theory with measurement but roughly looking at the shape of the 
probability distribution. The current paper maintains that the phase noise is Gaussian 
distributed that is the same as laser phase noise. If phase noise is Gaussian distributed, there is 
on reason we need this new paper with all the analysis in [24, 26, 27] for laser phase noise and 
the argument in [25] of the equivalence. If phase noise is non-Gaussian distributed, this paper is 
wrong. In both cases, this paper should be rejected.   
 
Currently,  there  is  still  argument  on  whether  the  phase  noise  is  Gaussian  or  non-Gaussian 
distributed when [31] and [33] are compared. However, the numerical results in [34] seem to 
indicate  that  the  assumption  of  non-Gaussian  distribution  gives  worse  error  probability  and 
larger penalty. While it is arguable whether the difference of only up to fraction of a dB in [34] 
is significant, just completely ignores the issue in the current paper is not appropriate.

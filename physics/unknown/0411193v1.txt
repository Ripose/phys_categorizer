We report results from experiments performed to study how a DC bias with respect to 
the  plasma  potential  is  affecting  the  plasma  states  in  the  toroidal  geometry  of  the 
Blaamann  device  in  Tromso.  In  the  experiments  discussed  here,  a  ring  with  smaller 
diameter than the limiter was centered inside the bulk of the plasma and its bias varied 
with respect to the plasma potential. 
In  the  electron  saturation  current  regime  of  the  ring,  a  significant  reduction  of  the 
fluctuation levels was observed, and a shear in the poloidal velocity occurred at the low-
field  side  of  the  ring.  This  shear  was  positioned  at  the  same  radial  position  as  the 
maximum  of  the  radial  transport  when  the  ring  was  left  floating  or  biased  in  the  ion 
saturation current regime. For the latter ring biases, the poloidal velocities had no shear 
on  the  low-field  side  of  the  ring.  Without  the  velocity  shear,  the  radial  transport  was 
similar  to  previous  experiments  without  ring.  With  the  velocity  shear,  the  radial 
transport was destroyed. This plasma state, with very low radial transport and fluctuation 
levels  as  well  as  plasma  densities  around  1017  m-3,  is  believed  to  provide  a  suitable 
plasma for wave propagation studies in a magnetized plasma with curved magnetic field 
lines without end effects. 

 

Introduction 
 
In the last decades, it has been confirmed that reduction of radial transport in fusion devices 
is  closely  linked  to  decorrelation  of  turbulent  structures  due  to  shears  in  electric  fields  and 
poloidal velocities [1-3]. Consequently, many studies have been performed in order to achieve 
better control of plasma confinement by edge biasing [4-6]. Also basic plasma experiments on 
plasma rotation of relevance to space plasmas and applications have been conducted recently 
in  linear  devices  [7].  In  this  paper,  we  report  effects  from  biasing  an  internal  electrode  in  a 
plasma with a simple toroidal geometry, i.e. without a poloidal transform.  

 
The experiment 
 
The  simple  magnetized  torus  Blaamann  [8]  has  24  magnetic  field  coils,  which  produce  a 
toroidal  magnetic  field  of  up  to  3.5  kG  with  ripple,  d B/B,  less  than  0.01.  The  plasma  is 
produced  by  a  vertical  hot  tungsten  cathode  positioned  1-2  cm  inside  the  center  of  the 
equatorial plane of the smaller cross-section of the torus. It is heated to electron emission and 
biased  at  -140  V  relative  to  the  grounded  chamber  walls,  producing  an  energetic  primary 
electron  beam,  which  ionizes  the  neutral  gas.  The  resulting  plasma  exhibits  a  negative 
(cid:209) B and 
potential well near the centre of the poloidal cross-section and is subject to vertical  (cid:209)
typically  
curvature  drifts  and  poloidal  ExB-drift,  and  the  degree  of  ionisation 

is 

(cid:209)
(cid:209)
~  1  %.  A  poloidal  limiter  extending  two  cm  inwards  from  the  walls  receives  the  discharge 
current between the filament and the common ground. There is no toroidal current or poloidal 
magnetic field imposed on the plasma, and hence no poloidal transform exists.  

The present experiment was carried out in a helium gas at a pressure of 1.0x10-3 mbar and 
discharge  current  1  A.  The  toroidal  magnetic  field  was  set  to  572  G,  and  the  filament  was 
biased at –140 V with respect to the walls. An 8 cm diameter ring electrode made of 6 mm 
diameter  stainless  steel  tube  was  inserted  vertically  in  the  poloidal  cross-section  next  to  the 
limiter, as shown schematically in Fig 1 a).

The electrical circuit of the experiment including the filament circuit is shown in Fig. 1b). 
The  discharge  current  between  the  filament  circuit  and  the  grounded  chamber  walls  is  about 
1.0 A without the ring being connected to the circuit (i.e. floating ring). In this case, the ring is 
floating  at  -22  V.  When  the  ring  is  grounded, it draws an electron current of about 650 mA, 
while  the  discharge  current  is  reduced  to  700  mA.  In  the  following,  we  will  discuss  results 
from  experiments  when  the  ring  is  grounded  (at  zero  V),  floating,  and  biased  at  –  40  V, 
respectively. 
 
The diagnostics was carried out by means of  Langmuir probes, one probe obtaining swept 
Langmuir  IV  characteristics  (probe  #1)  and  a  second  3-pin  probe  measuring  radial  flux 
parameters (probe #2). The vertical displacement was 2.5 mm for the probe pins measuring the 
poloidal  E-field  fluctuations,  and  the  electron  saturation  current  was  sampled  for  density 
fluctuations at a probe pin placed vertically in the midpoint between the E-field pins. 

  

Data  was  acquired  by  radially  scanning  the  probes  inwards  from  a  position  close  to  the 
limiter on the low-field side (outside the filament) to a position well inside the filament on the 
high-field side.

With  the  ring  floating,  the  profile  of  the  plasma  potential  (Vp,  Fig.  2a))  is  similar  to  the 
usual  case  without  any  ring  inserted  in  the  cross-section,  with  the  exception  of  a  minor 
flattening  of  the  profile  near  the  circumference  of  the  ring.  On  the  other  hand,  outside  the 
circumference of the grounded ring the plasma potential is nearly constant with values close to 
zero.

The electron density (Fig. 2 b) is skewed towards the low-field side of the circumference of 
the floating ring. In this region, the density is also higher than in the case of the grounded ring. 
This  may  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  grounded  ring  is  drawing  an  electron  saturation 
current of about 650 A, and thus acts as an effective sink for the plasma particles. Also around 
the high-field side of the grounded ring, the density is depleted by nearly a factor two. 

The electron temperature (Fig. 2c) is only slightly affected by the grounded ring, being less 

by approximately one eV outside the circumference of the ring in this case.

The  average  values  of  the electron  saturation current (Isat) shown in Fig. 3a) is increasing 
when the ring is biased at negative potential with respect to the floating potential, i.e. in the ion 
saturation  regime.  On  the  other  hand,  the  floating  potential (Vf) is  not  much affected by this 
ring bias (Fig. 3b), apart from a small increase in the relative fluctuations compared to the case 
with  a  floating  ring  (Fig.  3d).    The  relative  fluctuations  of  Isat  are  not  affected  at  all.  This 
shows that a negative bias with respect to the plasma is improving the plasma confinement, but 
at  a  cost  of  slightly  higher  fluctuation  levels  in  the  floating  potential,  possibly  because of an 
increased growth rate in the flute instability due to larger density gradients.

Figure 4. Skewness of Isat( a) and Vf (b) and kurtosis of Isat (c) and Vf (d). Red circles 
correspond to ring biased at -40 V, black squares to ring floating, and green triangles 
represent data with grounded ring. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  when  the  ring  is  grounded,  at  a  potential  in  the  electron  saturation 
regime, Isat is reduced below the level of the current when the ring is floating, as noted already 
from the Langmuir density measurements.  However, as seen from the error bars in Fig 3a) and 
b), the fluctuations are significantly reduced in both Isat and Vf .  The relative fluctuations are 

severely reduced, especially in the floating potential (Fig 3d), which is reduced to 0.1 or less on 
the low-field side of the filament. The relative fluctuation levels of Isat, are reduced to less than 
0.2  on  the  low-field  side  of  the  ring,  but  inside  they  are  of  the  same  order  as  the  saturation 
current fluctuations in the floating ring case. The grounded ring thus produces a very quiescent 
plasma  state  in  this  device,  which  otherwise  confines  a  very  turbulent  plasma.  Although  the 
plasma density near the center of the cross section is reduced somewhat, the densities are still 
of the order of 1017 m-3 over radial span of more than 6 cm. The plasma potential profile has on 
the  same  time  a  very  small  gradient  in  this  region.  Assuming  that  this  plasma  state  can  be 
achieved  for  a  set  of  different  magnetic  fields  and  neutral  gas  pressure,  this  configuration 
should  provide  excellent  conditions  for  the  systematic  study  of  wave  propagation  in 
magnetized plasma with a curved geometry and without end effects.  

The other statistics moments, i.e. skewness and kurtosis, are shown in Fig. 4. The skewness 
in Isat is now Gaussian inside the grounded ring, as is also the case for the other ring biases. On 
the low field side of the ring the skewness of Isat is sharply decreasing to large negative values 
in  the  grounded  case,  while  it  for  the  other  cases  reach  the  same  skewness  values  more 
gradually towards the limiter.

Overall, the floating potential becomes more Gaussian with The skewness of Vf is close to 
zero inside the grounded ring, while for the biased rings the skewness is negative throughout 
the radial cross section. For both the Isat and Vf the kurtosis is close to zero inside the ring at 
all bias values, while it deviates more from zero outside the ring.  

 
The poloidal velocities are plotted in Fig. 5a). It can be noted that for the ring biased at – 40 
V  or  at  floating  potential,  the  plasma  is  rotating  in  the  same  sense  as  has  been  observed  in 
previous  experiments  [9],  with  nearly  constant  negative  velocity  in  the  low-field  side 
throughout the radial cross-section. On the other hand, when the ring is grounded, there is a 
strong velocity shear just outside the ring, bringing the rotation down to nearly zero velocity 
and  slightly  positive.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  shear  coincides  with  the  location  of 
maximum  radial  transport  in  the  cases  with  floating  and  negatively  biased  ring.  For  these 
biases the plasma rotation is similar to what is commonly observed in the Blaamannn plasma, 
i.e., constant throughout the cross section of the low-field side. Thus, there is strong evidence 
that the velocity shear imposed at the position of maximum radial transport is destroying the 
radial transport.  

 
Conclusion. 
We have performed experiments to study how a ring biased with respect to the plasma 
potential is affecting the plasma states in the toroidal geometry of the Blaamann device in 
Tromso. A ring with smaller diameter (8 cm) than the limiter was centered inside the bulk 
of the plasma and its bias varied with respect to the plasma potential. 

In the  electron saturation current regime of the  ring (at ground potential), a significant 
reduction  of  the  fluctuation  levels  was  observed,  and  a  shear  in  the  poloidal  velocity 
occurred  at  the  low-field  side  of  the  ring.  This  shear  was  positioned  at  the  same  radial 
position as the maximum of the radial transport when the ring was left floating or biased in 
the ion saturation current regime. For the latter ring biases, the poloidal velocities had no 
shear on the low-field side of the ring. Without the velocity shear, the radial transport was 
similar to previous experiments without ring. With the velocity shear, the radial transport 
was destroyed. Very low radial transport and fluctuation levels as well as plasma densities 
being still around 1017 m-3, characterize this plasma state. It is believed to provide suitable 
plasma  for  wave  propagation  studies  in  magnetized  plasma  with  curved  magnetic  field 
lines and no end effects.

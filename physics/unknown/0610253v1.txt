ABSTRACT 

We  demonstrate  a  magnetometric  technique  based  on  nonlinear  magneto-optical  rotation  using  amplitude  modulated 
light.    The  magnetometers  can  be  operated  in  either  open-loop  (typical  nonlinear  magneto-optical  rotation  with 
amplitude-modulated  light)  or  closed-loop  (self-oscillating)  modes.    The  latter  mode  is  particularly  well  suited  for 
conditions where the magnetic field is changing by large amounts over a relatively short timescale. 

Keywords:  Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation, magnetometry, self-oscillation 

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. The Krakow-Berkeley Laboratory  

In this contribution, we present some recent results of the collaboration between our two experimental atomic physics 
groups at the Jagiellonian University, Kraków and the Department of Physics at the University of California at Berkeley, 
respectively.  For  the  last  several  years,  the  two  groups  have  been  involved  in  scientific  exchange  including  mutual 
research visits at all levels from undergraduate students to principal investigators, with a distinct emphasis on the student 
training and providing the students with a unique experience of performing research in a foreign country as a part of an 
international research team. A highlight of the collaboration is the establishment of a joint Kraków-Berkeley laboratory 
(www.if.uj.edu.pl/pl/ZF/k-b_lab/)  located  at  the  M.  Smoluchowski  Institute  of  Physics  at  Kraków,  where  Berkeley 
students work on a regular basis in close collaboration with Polish colleagues.  

1.2. Nonlinear magneto-optical rotation (NMOR) 

The  central  subject  of  the  collaboration  is  the  investigation  of  nonlinear  magneto-optical  processes  (see,  for  example, 
review [1]), including their fundamental properties, as well as applications to sensitive electromagnetic measurements, 
and, in particular, to atomic magnetometry.   

In general, a nonlinear magneto-optical interaction can be thought of as consisting of three major steps. In the first step, 
light  interacting  with  an  atomic  ensemble  creates  anisotropy  (polarization)  of  the  ground  atomic  state,  which,  in  the 
second step, evolves in the presence of external electromagnetic fields. In most NMOR experiments and in the present 
work,  the  dominant  contribution  to  the  ground  state  polarization  is  the  rank  2  polarization  (quadrupole)  moment,  also 
known as alignment. In the case of a weak static magnetic field and low light power, the evolution is simply the Larmor 
spin precession of the polarized atoms. In general, the evolution could be more complicated, and could be influenced, for 
example,  by  off-resonant  interactions  with  the  strong  laser  light  itself,  leading  to  processes  such  as  alignment-to-
orientation  conversion  (AOC)  (see,  for  example,  [2]).  Finally,  the  third  stage  of  a  magneto-optical  rotation  involves 
detecting the evolved atomic polarization with probe light. Either optical absorption or rotation can be used in this last 
step; however, optical rotation is typically preferred as it allows for cancellation of common-mode optical noise. 

 

In typical Faraday geometry (where the magnetic field is parallel to the propagation direction of linearly polarized light) 
with unmodulated light, the optical rotation measured as a function of the magnetic field takes the shape of a dispersive 
Lorentzian centered about zero magnetic field.  The small-field magnetometric sensitivity is then inversely proportional 
to the slope of the optical rotation as a function of the magnetic field, given by Α/γ, where A is the amplitude of the zero 
field  resonance  and  γ  is  the  width  of  the  resonance  proportional  to  the  ground  state  polarization  relaxation  rate.  
Sensitivity drops rapidly when the rate of Larmor precession is greater than the ground state relaxation rate because the 
light-induced polarization gets washed out due rapid precession in the magnetic field. 

To extend the magnetometric sensitivity to magnetic fields where Larmor precession is much faster than the ground state 
relaxation rate, it is necessary to synchronize the optical pumping rate with Larmor precession.  This can be achieved by 
modulating  the  light  (see,  for  example,  review  [3]).  The  two  most  commonly  used  types  of  modulation  are  those  of 
frequency  (FM)  and  amplitude  (AM).  Both  these  methods  allow  one  to  construct  sensitive  all-optical,  broad  dynamic 
range  devices  that  do  not  require  application  of  any  additional  fields  to  the  atoms  (such  as  the  radio-  or  microwave-
frequency magnetic fields used in traditional double-resonance optical-pumping magnetometers).  The latter method is 
the subject of this contribution. 

Pioneering applications of amplitude-modulated light were introduced in atomic and molecular spectroscopy in the early 
1960’s  by  Bell  and  Bloom  [4]  and  Corney  and  Series  [5].  In  the  context  of  NMOR  it  was  done  in  Refs.  [6,7].  The 
application of amplitude-modulated light in NMOR, the so-called AMOR (amplitude-modulated optical rotation), yields 
narrow NMOR resonances centered at zero magnetic field, along with additional sets of resonances at higher magnetic 
fields where the frequency of amplitude modulation is synchronized with the Larmor precession. The position of these 
high-field resonances is linear in the frequency of amplitude modulation Ωm and their amplitude and width is comparable 
with the zero-field resonances, yielding the possibility of precise measurements of strong magnetic fields. 

2. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 

The layout of AMOR experimental setup is presented in Fig. 1. Light from an external-cavity diode laser was tuned to 
the center of the F=2→F’=1 D1 line of 87Rb (795 nm). Light frequency was controlled with a Doppler-free dichroic lock 
[8], which enables its precise, long-term stabilization. Some light was also directed to a saturation spectroscopy system, 
providing information about the frequency of the laser light. The main beam was transmitted in a single pass through an 
analog acousto-optical modulator (AOM) driven by an 80-MHz radio-frequency (RF) signal. The amplitude of the RF 
signal  could  be  modulated  with  arbitrary  waveforms  and  frequencies  ranging  from  ~1  kHz  to  ~80  kHz  producing  a 
corresponding  amplitude  modulation  of  the  laser  light.  The  source  of  amplitude  modulation  was  either  a  function 
generator  in  the  open-loop  mode  (see  Sec.  3.1),  or  a  signal  derived  from  the  measured  optical  rotation  in  the  self-
oscillating mode (see Sec. 3.2). 

The amplitude-modulated light of 2 mm in diameter passed through a high-quality linear polarizer and then through a 
cylindrical, paraffin-coated glass cell (1 cm long, 1 cm in diameter) containing isotopically enriched 87Rb (nuclear spin 
I=3/2). The cell was heated to about 40◦C to achieve optimal concentration of rubidium atoms (the absorption depth of 
about  0.3).  The  paraffin  coating  on  the  cell  greatly  reduces  the  relaxation  of  ground-state  atomic  polarization  during 
collisions with the cell walls, yielding lifetimes on the order of hundreds of milliseconds [9]. Since the atoms bounce off 
the cell walls many times in one polarization-relaxation time, they effectively sample the average magnetic field in the 
cell, reducing relaxation due to field inhomogeneities [10], an effect known as motional narrowing. The cell was placed 
within a 3-layer μ-metal magnetic shield. The shield provided passive attenuation of external magnetic fields at a level of 
about  one  part  in  ten  thousand.  Additionally,  a  set  of  three  mutually  orthogonal  magnetic  coils  was  placed  inside  the 
shield. It enabled compensation of residual magnetic fields inside the shield, as a well as generation of a well controlled 
magnetic field. Using the coils the longitudinal magnetic field could be scanned from -200 mG to 200 mG. 

After passing through the cell, the polarization of the light was analyzed with a balanced polarimeter that consisted of a 
polarizing beam-splitter rotated by 45○ with respect to the initial  light polarization and two photodiodes. In open-loop 
mode,  a  photodiode  difference  signal  was  fed  to  a  lock-in  amplifier  and  measured  at  the  first  harmonic  of  light-
modulation frequency Ωm. In-phase and quadrature signals were stored on a computer. In the self-oscillating mode with 
closed-loop, the photodiode difference signal was first amplified and phase-shifted and then fed back to the AOM.  The 
frequency of the resulting signal in this case was measured with a frequency counter.

closed loop. Changing the switch to the other position converted the experiment to the open-loop AMOR experiment (open-loop 
configuration.

 

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Open-loop AMOR configuration 

Typical  non-optimized  AMOR  signals  with  the  open-loop  configuration  are  presented  in  Fig.  2.  The  results  were 
recorded  with  sinusoidal  modulation  of  100%  depth  and  with  an  average  light  intensity,  e.g.,  intensity  measure  after 
AOM, of 3 μW/mm2. In addition to a typical zero field resonance observed in unmodulated NMOR experiments, two 
resonances were observed centered at magnetic fields B such that  

Ωm= ±2ΩL = ±2gμΒΒ/ħ, 

 

 

 

 

    (1) 

where ΩL is the Larmor frequency, g≈2/(2I+1) is the Landé factor, μΒ is the Bohr magneton. Given the linear relationship 
between  the  center  of  the  resonance  and  the  magnetic  field,  the  AMOR  resonance  can  be  used  to  directly  obtain  
a measurement of the magnetic field. Using frequency-modulated light yields resonances in the same position [11] and it 
was recently demonstrated that sensitivity on the order of 6·10-10 G/Hz1/2 in a 3.5-cm cell can be obtained in geophysical 
range fields in open-loop mode [12].

One advantage of AM over FM is the straightforward possibility of varying the modulation waveforms. In particular, 
AM enables modulating light intensity with variable duty cycle square-modulation. In Fig. 3 we show the AMOR signals 
for several different duty cycles of square-wave modulation. Decreasing the duty cycle caused appearance of additional 
resonances at magnetic fields corresponding to ΩL = nΩm/2, where n is an integer number. These resonances arise due to 
higher harmonic of Ωm present in the modulation signal. While for 50% duty cycle the dominant Fourier component in 
the modulation signal is the one at Ωm, for lower duty cycles the higher Fourier components (nΩm) become significant, 
leading  to  strong  additional  resonances.  To  verify  that  our  understanding  of  this  phenomenon  is  correct  we  simulated 
signals using a modified, time-dependent Kanorsky-Weis model [13]. A dashed line in Fig. 3(c) shows predictions of the 
model for a given duty cycle. The predictions are in good agreement with experimental results.  

In a discussed case resonances occur at harmonics of the modulation frequency and they reach high magnetic fields 
even with low modulation frequency of light. This reduces experimental requirements because high magnetic fields can 
be measured with low frequency and low duty cycle. It also enables the stabilization of the magnetic fields so that the 
Larmor frequency and the modulation frequencies are simple fractions, for example, 2:1, 3:5, 7:2. 

An advantage of AMOR over FM NMOR is a possibility of tuning laser frequency in order to minimize AC Stark 

effect [6]. This effect is one of the limiting factors in high-precision measurements of magnetic fields based on NMOR.

3.2. Self-oscillation AMOR (closed-loop configuration) 

In  a  typical  AMOR  experiment,  the  optical  rotation  is  detected  synchronously  with  a  lock-in  amplifier  at  the  first 
harmonic of Ωm.  If the magnetic field varies by less than the width of the resonance, the resulting in-phase part of the 
signal can give a direct measurement of the magnetic field without changing Ωm. However, since very narrow resonances 
can be obtained with paraffin coated cells, this results in a magnetometer with a very small dynamic range centered about 
B=0 and  B=±ħΩm/(2gμB).  For a larger dynamic range, the in-phase component may be used as an error signal, adjusting 
the  modulation  frequency  so  that  the  in-phase  component  is  zero.    The  magnetic  field  can  then  be  determined  from  
Eq. (1). The major drawback of this approach is that if the magnetic field jumps by many linewidths, the resonance will 
be lost. 

A more practical approach is the so-called self-oscillation mode, originating in the classic work [14]. In our version of 
this approach, instead of using an external function generator to drive the AOM, the difference signal from the balanced 
polarimeter  drives  the  AOM  directly.  We  start  by  assuming  some  initially  aligned  atomic  state  and  some  weak,  static 
laser  beam.  The  atoms  precess  in  the  magnetic  field,  generating  optical  rotation  and  photocurrent  at  2ΩL.  This 
photocurrent drives the AOM, modulating the light at the exact frequency necessary to reinforce the initial alignment. In 
this manner, the entire system which includes the polarized atoms, polarimeter, and amplitude modulated light becomes 
an oscillator, oscillating at 2ΩL.  The onset of self-oscillation can be analyzed by considering some initial noise in the 
laser or balanced polarimeter to jump-start the oscillator. 

The above scheme can be implemented with either a single beam, as in the present work and shown in Fig. 1, or with two 
beams,  as  in  Ref.  [15].    In  either  case,  maximal  optical  rotation  of  the  probe  beam  occurs  when  the  aligned  state  is 
rotated  by  π/4  with  respect  to  the  initial  polarization  of  the  light.    Since  alignment  is  created  parallel  to  the  initial 
polarization of the light, it is thus necessary to shift the phase of the signal from the balanced polarimeter by π/2 before 
feeding it back into the AOM.  In the single-beam arrangement, this is accomplished electronically with the phase shifter 
in Fig. 1, while in the two-beam configuration this is accomplished mechanically by rotating the polarization of the probe 
beam by π/4 relative to the pump beam [15].  

In  Fig.  4  we  show  an  example  of  single-beam  self-oscillating  AMOR  signal  for  typical  parameters.    The  dominant 
Fourier  component of  the  signal  is  at 2ΩL,  with  additional  higher harmonics.   The  primary  reason for  the presence  of 
higher harmonics is the fact that the functions of pumping and probing are accomplished by the same beam.  Hence, the 

 

amplitude  of  the  “probe”  beam  is  also  being  modulated  periodically  (the  dominant  Fourier  component  is  at  2ΩL,  but 
higher harmonics are also present) in addition to the rotation of the polarization.  There may also be some effects from 
the electronics in the feedback loop.  In future work these issues will be addressed in more detail.

Despite  the  complex  structure  of  the  self-oscillating  AMOR  signal,  its  frequency  can  be  still  measured.  In  Fig.  5  the 
dependence of the AMOR signal frequency versus magnetic field is shown. The frequency was measured directly with a 
frequency  counter  without  any  filtering.  The  frequency  of  the  self  oscillating  AMOR  signal  is  linear  in  the  magnetic 
field, as expected. 

Figure 5. Frequency of the single-beam self-oscillation AMOR signal follows changes of the magnetic field. Results were recorded 
with light intensity of ~35 μW/mm2. 

The range of magnetic fields over which the present experiment can operate is relatively small, limited by the electronics 
used  to  shift  the  phase  of  the  signal  before  being  fed  back  into  the  AOM.  To  achieve  sensitivity  to  a  larger  range  of 
magnetic fields it will be necessary to use a phase shifter with a wider bandwidth. An alternative solution may be the use 
of a phase-locked loop as in recent work of Ref. [16] on a self oscillating magnetometer with frequency-modulated light. 
Such a solution would ensure the constant phase-shift between light modulation and AMOR signal independently of the 

 

 

frequency  of  these  signals.  As  mentioned  above,  the  needed  phase  shift  is  easily  produced  the  in  a  two-beam 
arrangement by rotating the polarization of the pump beam relative to the probe. In addition to producing a frequency 
independent phase shift, this has the added advantage that the resulting signal from the balanced polarimeter is purely 
sinusoidal.  

One of the advantages of the self-oscillating magnetometers is its bandwidth. The demonstrated bandwidth of the self-
oscillating two-beam magnetometer exceeds 1 kHz [15]. In addition with a sensitivity at a level of 3 nG achieved for 1-s 
measurement  [15],  it  opens  a  possibility  of  construction  of  a  high-performance  all-optical  atomic  magnetometer. 
Application  of  such  components  as  vertical-cavity  surface-emitting  lasers,  optical  fibers,  microfabricated  vapor  cells, 
ect., enables miniaturization of the device and its low-power consumption. Thus it opens a possibility for its commercial 
applications. 

Figure 6 shows quasi-instantaneous response of the self-oscillating magnetometer to a change of the magnetic field. The 
response of the two-beam self-oscillating magnetometer was monitored by heterodyning the NMOR signal with a fixed 
reference frequency on a lock-in amplifier (for more details see Ref. [15]). 
 

Fig. 6. Response of the two-beam self-oscillating magnetometer to a 570 μG step in magnetic field, in the presence of an over-all bias 
field of ~14mG (a). The step is large compared to the resonance line width, but small compared to the bias field. The self-oscillation 
waveform was recorded on a digital storage oscilloscope and subsequently fit to a sinusoid in overlapping time windows 500 μs long, 
spaced by 125 μs. In part (b), step change of a magnetic field is shown. 

 

 

 

4.  CONCLUSION 

We have demonstrated operation of all-optical atomic magnetometers based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation with 
amplitude-modulated light.  First a typical AMOR experiment was discussed and its possible applications for magnetic 
field measurements were described. Then attention was switched to AMOR experiments in the so-called self-oscillation 
regime. In such configuration NMOR signal is used for amplitude modulation of light which simplifies an experimental 
arrangement setup. Two different experimental realizations of self-oscillation AMOR were presented.  First scheme uses 
a single light beam for pumping and probing atoms. That facilitates the use of microfabrication techniques to construct 
small, lightweight, portable atomic magnetometers. The range of magnetic fields over which the present experiment may 
self oscillate is limited by the bandwidth of the electronics used to produce the necessary phase shift. Finally, a robust, 
high-bandwidth  magnetometer  using  separated  (modulated)  pump  and  (unmodulated)  probe  laser  beams  has  been 
described. In such arrangement magnetic field can be measured at a sensitivity level 3 nG at 1 s with a bandwidth 1 kHz.

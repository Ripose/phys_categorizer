Abstract 
 
We  derive  empirical  relationships  among  elementary  fermion  masses  based  on  relatively  simple 
exponential  formulae  involving  quantum  numbers  for  the  electromagnetic  and  strong  interactions,  with  a 
weak  correction  factor  motivated  by  a  simple  linear  combination  of  mass  terms  for  the  weak  and 
electromagnetic interactions of charged leptons.  This results in a prediction of mt  =  1776.81246 (49) MeV.  
We find a simple 2p
 relationship among neutrino mass ratios agrees well with present neutrino oscillation 
measurements.    We  extend  the  form  of  the  mass  ratios  to  the  quark  sector,  giving  qualitative  agreement 
with quark masses. 
 
 
 
 

1.  Introduction 

The  masses  of  the  elementary  fermions  in  the  Standard  Model  seem  to  have  arbitrary 
values.  There is a clear hierarchy in the sense that masses increase as one goes from the 
first to third generation.  For a given generation the mass of the neutrino is much less than 
that of the charged lepton, which  is, in turn, less  than that of the associated  quarks.    In 
this work we propose a set of empirical relations for mass ratios among the generations as 
well as between the lepton and quark sectors. 
 
We begin with a  relationship among the generations of charged leptons, then propose a 
possible relation among the generations of neutrinos, then continue with relations among 
the  generations  of  up-type  and  down-type  quarks.    Finally  we  propose  an  empirical 
relationship that connects the lepton masses with those of the quarks.

This formula fits the experimental data remarkably well. 
 
In  this  paper  we  take  a  different  empirical  approach  to  the  mass  ratios  of  the  charged 
leptons.  We begin by noting that the natural logarithms of the mass ratios are very near 
to certain rational numbers.

If we assign generation numbers to the charged leptons with G = 1 for the electron, G = 2 
for the muon, and G = 3 for the tau, the relations (2) and (3) can be replaced with a single 
relation 
 

 or t  and D G is the difference in generation numbers. 

 
Where x is either m
 
The question arises as to the origin of the factor of 3 in equation (4).  One possibility is 
that it is related to the electric charge of the charged leptons.  As we shall see later, when 
investigating mass ratio relationships in the quark sector, it is convenient to define Q = 
3|q|, where q is the charge in elementary units.  Then we rewrite equation (4) a bit more 
generally as

At  this  point  the  mass  relation  is  just  approximate.    If  we  associate  the  mass  in  some 
sense with the interactions of elementary particles, then the charged leptons should have a 
contribution from the weak interaction as well as the electromagnetic interaction, which 
presumably dominates the mass.  We postulate that the measured mass is a simple sum of 
weak and  electromagnetic terms and that the electromagnetic term follows equation (5) 
exactly, i.e.,

Plugging in the measured masses gives negative values for e 1 , e 2 , and e 3.  This implies 
that the measured mass is diminished by the weak contribution, rather than augmented by 
it,  as  might  be  suggested  by  a  composite  model  of  charged  leptons.    We  continue  the 
empirical approach by keeping the e ’s positive and incorporating the negative sign into

Putting  in  the  Codata  2002  values  for  the  charged  lepton  masses,  the  positive  root 
solution gives a = 6.2263.  The negative root solution gives the trivial a = 1 solution.  The 
positive root value is rather close to 2p
 
which  will  allow  us  to  calculate  e 1  based  on  the  measured  electron  and  muon  masses, 
then make a prediction for the tau mass. 
 
Thus, we now have for the measured masses

where x = m
 
Using  the  measured  value  of    mm   /  me  =  206.7682838  (54)  from  the  Codata  2002 
compilation in equation (19a), we calculate e 1 = 0.0003279266 (67).  Using this value of 
e 1  in  equation  (19b)  then  gives  a  prediction  that  mt   =    1776.81246  (49) MeV,  which  is 
within one standard deviation of the measured value. 
 
It  is  interesting  to  compare  this  prediction  with  the  prediction  from  the  Koide  formula, 
equation  (1),  which  gives  mt   =    1776.969  (19)  MeV.    The  difference  between  this 
prediction  and  that  of  equation  (19b)  is  157  keV,  well  below  the  measurement  error, 
which  is  dominated  by  the  BES  measurement  of  the  t   mass  [3].    The  KEDR  detector 
group  [4]  at  VEPP-4M  is  currently  measuring  the  t   mass  using  the  same  technique  as 
BES, but with a much smaller error in the beam energy.  If they measure the mass to a 
precision  of  50  keV  or  better,  this  measurement  should  unambiguously  distinguish 
between these two predictions. 
 
To summarize, although there were a number of somewhat arbitrary assumptions made in 
arriving at the mass relation given in equation (20), the end result agrees very well with 
the  t   mass  measurement.    It  predicts  a  slightly  different  mass  from  that  of  the  Koide 
formula, allowing experimental differentiation of the differing predictions.  As we shall 
see  later  in  this  paper  the  form  of  equation  (20)  suggests  an  extension  to  mass  ratio 
relationships among the quarks.

3.  Neutrino Mass Ratios 

As is well known, the existence of neutrino oscillations requires neutrinos to have non-
zero masses.  Recent KamLAND measurements for reactor neutrino oscillations [5] give

masses  are  associated  with  the  weak  interaction  and  that  their  masses  are  in  the  same 
ratio as for the weak contribution to the charged lepton masses, then we propose 
m

where i = 2 for x = m
 
Combining equation (21) with the reactor neutrino oscillation data, one can calculate the

Putting in the measurement gives m1 = 0.00143 (5) eV.  Equations (21) then give m2 =

, which is a bit high compared to the measurement.  One can 
get  better  agreement  with  both  measurements  by  fitting  the  neutrino  masses  using  both 
the reactor and atmospheric neutrino oscillation measurements.  This gives m1 = 0.00139 
12mD
(6) eV, m2 = 0.0087 (4) eV, and m3 = 0.055 (2) eV, which result in a value of 
 about 
23mD
 
0.8 standard deviations below the central value of the measurement and a value of 
about  1.2  standard  deviations  above  the  central  value  of  the  measurement.    Clearly  the 
data are not precise enough to rule out the mass relations given in equation (21), although 
these relations are only weakly motivated.

4.  Quark Mass Ratios 

Since  quarks  are  confined  within  hadrons,  quark  masses  are  not  as  well  determined  as 
lepton masses.  Additionally quark masses depend upon the theoretical framework used 
to define them [7].  Nonetheless we can extend the methods used in the previous sections 
to find relationships between the generations of quarks.  The quark mass ratios will have 
a factor for the electromagnetic interaction and another factor for the strong interaction.  
Additionally they will have a correction for the weak interaction.  For the electromagnetic 
interaction, we assume the form of equation (7).  For the up-type quarks, Q = 2, so

Similarly, for the down-type quarks, Q = 1, so  

 
We  assume  that  the  strong  interaction  factor  multiplies  the  electromagnetic  factor,  that 
the form of the strong factor is exponential, and that there is a weak factor which is the 
same as for the charged leptons, i.e.

Since  the  masses  of  the  heavier  quarks  are  better  determined  than  those  of  the  light

quark masses, although the up and charm quark masses are somewhat high.

Consistency  with  the  intergenerational  formulas,  equations  (20),  (21),  and  (33)  provide 
six constraint equations among the constants ai, bi, and ci in the exponents as well as two 
constraints  involving  the  weak  correction  term.    The  intergenerational  formulas  can  be

The  equations  (35a-i)  are  only  approximate.    We  can  make  them  exact  by  introducing 
two constants, one for the ratio of quark to charged lepton masses, the other for the ratio 
of neutrino to charged lepton masses.  To be precise, we define them using the now exact 
equations

Using  equations  (40a-i)  and  (20),  the  constants  e 1,  Fq,  Fn ,  a3,  b3,  c3,  plus  the  measured 
electron  mass,  one  can  calculate  the  rest  of  the  masses.    The  numerical  results  of  this

Table 4: Measured and calculated masses.  The measured masses come from Codata 2002 [1] for the 
charged leptons, neutrino oscillation measurements [5,6] plus the assumptions in section 3 for the 
neutrinos, the PDG 2004 compilation [7] for the quarks, except for the top quark which is from recent 
Fermilab results [8].  The calculations use equations (20) for the charged leptons and (40a-i) for the others. 
 

 
The values from the intragenerational formulas, equations (40a-i), give slightly different 
numbers than those derived from the intergenerational formulas because of the different 
assumptions that go into the two cases.  For the intragenerational formulas, the constants 
Fq  and  Fn   are  defined  to  make  the  top  and  n 3  masses  agree  with  the  experimentally 
measured ones, which then skew some of the other masses.  As with the intergenerational 
formulas, the calculated up and charm quark masses are somewhat large. 
 

6.  Summary and Conclusions 

As  noted  throughout  this  paper,  these  calculations  are  empirically  derived.    There  is, 
unfortunately,  no  theoretical  understanding  of  the  form  of  the  equations.    There  have 
been a number of attempts to derive deeper theoretical understanding of the Koide mass 
formula for charged leptons [9,10] and to extend it to the quark sector [11].  Additionally 
there  have  been  string  theory  motivated  results  for  both  charged  leptons  and  neutrinos 
[12].

As with the Koide formula, this work makes a definite and accurate prediction of the t  
mass.  If the KEDR or other experiments to measure the t  mass measure it with sufficient 
accuracy,  one  will  be  able  to  determine  whether  or  not  this  approach  to  mass  formulas 
has  any  merit.    For  the  neutrinos,  future  oscillation  experiments  will  provide  accurate 
values for m12 and m23, which will then allow us to see if the simple 2p
 relationship given 
in section 3 is valid for neutrino mass ratios. 
 
For the quark sector, these calculations give qualitative agreement with measured values, 
but are not completely satisfying.  There is clearly additional work needed to understand 
whether or not this approach has validity. 
 
Most  importantly  a  theory  needs  to  be  developed  that  gives  the  form  of  the  mass 
relationships and predicts the values of the six experimentally determined constants.  The 
simple  form  of  the  mass  ratio  relationships  and  their  linkage  with  the  weak, 
electromagnetic, and strong interactions, if correct, are remarkable. Hopefully this work 
is  the  first  step  towards  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  values  of  elementary  fermion 
masses.

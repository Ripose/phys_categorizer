We  present  a  reliable,  narrow  linewidth  (100 kHz)  continuous-wave  optical  parametric  oscillator  (OPO)  suitable  for  high-
resolution spectroscopy applications. The OPO is based on a periodically-poled lithium-niobate crystal and features a specially 
designed  intracavity  etalon  which  permits  its  continuous  tuning  and  stable  operation  at  any  desired  wavelength  in  a  wide 
operation range. We demonstrate Doppler-free spectroscopy on a rovibrational transition of methane at 3.39 µm.  

 
 

 
 
 

Considerable technological progress in the fabrication of 
periodically  poled  nonlinear  crystals,  durable  optical 
coatings,  ultra-stable  solid-state  pump  lasers  and  OPO 
design has recently led to a new generation of continuous-
wave optical parametric oscillators (cw OPOs) with single 
frequency output covering a very wide range of the near-
infrared  spectrum  (0.8 – 4.0 µm).  These  OPOs  can  now 
provide  substantial  amounts  (10 – 250 mW)  of  coherent 
radiation with  narrow  linewidth (< 160 kHz), continuous 
tunability 
long-term 
(several  GHz)  and  excellent 
stability.1-5  This  unique  combination  of  features  makes 
them  attractive  and  promising 
tools  for  molecular 
spectroscopy, especially in the wavelength region around 
3 µm, where fundamental vibrational modes of molecular 
bonds  containing  hydrogen  occur.  Accordingly,  several 
Doppler-limited  spectroscopic  applications  of  single 
frequency  cw  OPOs  were  demonstrated  since  1998.3-7 
However,  to  our  knowledge  no  experiments  employing 
cw  OPOs  for  Doppler-free  spectroscopy  have  been 
reported  yet.  In  this  Letter,  we  describe  a  new  OPO

Doppler-free resonances in methane at 3.39 µm.

Until recently, one of the remaining challenges in using 
cw  OPOs  for  spectroscopic  applications  has  been  to 
prevent  gaps  in  the  spectral  coverage  and  thereby  to 
guarantee access to every atomic and molecular transition 
of  interest.  In  case  of  the  singly-resonant  OPOs  with 
resonated pump (PR-SROs) employed by our group, such 
gaps  were  generally  caused  by  imperfections  of  optical 
coatings  and  irregularities  in  the  nonlinear  crystal.  The 
resulting  spurious  modulation  of  the  wide  OPO  gain 
profile  often  lead  to  unpredictable  mode  hops  between 
widely  spaced  longitudinal  cavity  modes.  In  order  to 
avoid these problems, it is desirable to provide additional 
mode  selection.  To  this  end,  we  have departed from our 
previous semi-monolithic cavity design1 to implement an 
extended  cavity  setup  with  a  specially  designed 
intracavity  etalon  (ICE).  Unlike  the  etalons  commonly 
used  in  single-frequency  lasers  and  also  a  variety  of 
singly-resonant  OPOs4,5,8  this  ICE  is  located  inside  a 
cavity with two resonated waves, of which it should only 
affect one (signal) and not the other (pump). It is therefore 
antireflection  coated  for 
the 
performance of this coating is crucial.  

the  pump  wave  and 

The OPO arrangement is shown schematically in Fig. 1. 
A  monolithic  diode-pumped  Nd:YAG  ring  laser  with  a 

linewidth  < 5 kHz  and  1 W  single-frequency  output 
power  at  1064  nm  is  used  as  a  pump  source.  The 
frequency can be tuned by up to 40 GHz (9 GHz without 
mode hops) by changing the laser crystal temperature. An 
optical  isolator  prevents  backreflections  from  the  OPO 
cavity. The OPO is based on a periodically poled lithium 
niobate (PPLN) crystal of 19 mm length and 0.5 x 50 mm 
aperture.  The  crystal  contains  33  gratings  with  periods 
ranging from 28.98 to 30.90 µm. At crystal temperatures 
between  145  and  170°C  they  provide  quasi-phase-
matching  for  signal  waves  in  the  wavelength  range 
1.48-1.93 µm,  corresponding  to  2.35-3.75 µm  for  the 
idler. The crystal is temperature stabilized within ± 2 mK 
and can be translated to select one of the gratings.

Schematic of the OPO setup (see text for details). 

 
The  extended  OPO  cavity  consists  of  three  plane  and 
one  concave  mirrors.  One  mirror  M1  is  directly  coated 
onto the plane entrance face of the nonlinear crystal and is 
highly  reflecting  for  the  pump  (98%)  and  the  signal 
(>99%  for  1.35-1.65 µm,  with  a  maximum  of  99.9%  at 
1.5 µm),  but  highly  transmitting  (>98%)  for  the  idler 
(3-4 µm).  The  concave  mirror  M2  of  100 mm  curvature 
radius  and  the  plane  end  mirror  M4  have  a  reflectivity 
better than 99.8% for the pump and signal, and 1% for the 
idler.  The  plane  mirror  M3  minimizes  the  angle  of 
incidence  at  the  concave mirror and therefore  astigmatic 
aberrations  of  the  resonator  mode.  At  45°  it  reflects 
99.8% of the pump and signal, and an average 3% of the 
idler. The second plane face of the crystal is antireflection 
residual 
coated 

three  wavelengths  with 

for  all 

reflectivities of 0.15% for the pump, < 1% (1.35-1.65 µm, 
minimum 0.1% at 1.5 µm) for the signal and < 2% for the 
idler. Thus, the idler wave is not resonated and leaves the 
cavity through the mirrors M1 and M2. 

length 

The  concave  mirror  is  located  43 mm  from  the crystal 
surface  and  is  mounted  on  a  piezoelectric  transducer 
(PZT).  The  optical 
is  420 mm, 
cavity 
corresponding to a free spectral range (FSR) of 360 MHz. 
the  fundamental  cavity  mode  with 
One  waist  of 
w0 = 35 µm (for the pump) is located at the entrance face 
of  the  crystal,  another  one  with  w0 = 440 µm  at  the  end 
mirror. The pump beam is focused into the PPLN crystal 
with  an  effective  mode  matching  to  the  fundamental 
cavity mode of 99%. The pump and signal waves are both 
resonated  in  the  same  folded  cavity,  whose  length  is 
locked  to  the  pump  laser1  using  a  Pound-Drever-Hall 
method.  

To  suppress  mode  hops  caused  by  environmental 
perturbations and which were observed to span a range of 
50 GHz an etalon is placed in the cavity. The ICE is made 
of  a  1 mm  thick  undoped  YAG  plate  (83 GHz  FSR), 
coated to provide a reflectivity of 15% per surface for the 
signal.  The  coating  exhibits  a  residual  reflectivity  of 
0.75% for the pump, which still affects the threshold and 
tuning behavior of the OPO. However, it is low enough to 
warrant stable operation. To minimize walk-off losses, the 
ICE is placed near the cavity end mirror where the beam 
is almost collimated.  

The  minimum  threshold  pump  power  of  the OPO  was 
305 mW at a signal wavelength of 1.55 µm. A finesse of 
85  and  a  measured  output  transmission  of  1.8%  for  the 
pump  wavelength  yield  roundtrip  cavity  losses  of  5.5%, 
of  which  1%  can  be  attributed  to  the  etalon.  At  a  pump 
input  power  of  808 mW  the  total  idler  output  power 
(through  M1  and  M2)  at  3.39 µm  was  58 mW.  The 
corresponding  quantum  efficiency  of  23%  is  mainly 
limited by the nonoptimal transmission of the input mirror 
for the pump.9  
 

stabilized  laser10  at  3.39 µm.  For  an  integration  time  of 
500 µs we found a linewidth of ~100 kHz. For integration 
times  longer  than  10 ms  the  output  linewidth  becomes 
dominated by frequency jitter of the pump laser.

cavity  is  also  displayed.  Both  frequencies  were  measured  with  a  high 
resolution wavemeter.  
 

By  synchronously  sweeping  the  pump  frequency  and 
tilting  the  ICE  using  a  galvanometer  scanner  continuous 
tuning  over  1.8 GHz  for  the  signal  (corresponding  to  5 
FSRs  of  the  cavity)  and  1 GHz  for  the  idler  waves  was 
achieved  (Fig. 3).  The  tuning  range  was  limited  by  the 
PZT  servo-amplifier  and  could  be  easily  extended.  In 
theory it should only be limited by the continuous tuning 
range of a pump laser.

split into the saturating and probe beams and directed through a methane 
cell.  The probe  beam is  phase  modulated  by an electro-optic modulator 
(EOM)  at  a  frequency  of  1.24 MHz  (modulation  index  ~1),  the 
saturating  beam  is  chopped  by  the  acousto-optic  modulator  (AOM)  at 
100  kHz.  After  the  cell  the  probe  beam  is  sent  to  a  fast  photodetector, 
whose  output  is  analyzed  by  a  phase  sensitive  detection  circuit  and 
directed into a lock-in amplifier to extract the spectroscopic signal. The

wavemeter  and  frequency-locking  to  a  He-Ne/CH4  laser.  RP1,  RP2  -

To  demonstrate  the  capabilities  of  the  new  OPO,  we 
(2) 
have  performed  Doppler-free  spectroscopy  on  the  F2
component  of  the  P7  rovibrational  transition  of  the 
methane  molecule  at  3.39 µm.  This  line  is  traditionally 
used  as  a  high-stability  reference  line  in  He-Ne  optical 
frequency  standards.  The  spectroscopy  setup  is  shown 
schematically 
in  Fig. 4.  The  measurements  were 
performed  using  the  frequency  modulation  saturation 
technique11  in  a  2 m  long  methane cell. The  diameter of 
the  collimated  counterpropagating  probe  (2 mW)  and 
saturating (10 mW) beams inside the cell is about 8 mm, 
giving a transit-time broadening of approximately 30 kHz 
and a saturation parameter of ~ 0.1 at a methane pressure 
of  6 mTorr.  Chopping  of  the  saturating  beam  with  an 
acousto-optic  modulator  (AOM)  in  combination  with 
lock-in  detection  was  used  to  eliminate  the  Doppler 
broadened 
amplitude 
modulation. Using orthogonal polarizations for the pump 
and  probe  beams,  together  with  the  80 MHz  frequency 
shift  provided  by  the  AOM,  helps  very  effectively  to 
avoid  perturbations  of  the  OPO  due  to  back  reflections. 
To  suppress  slow  frequency  drifts  of  the  OPO,  the  idler 
frequency was frequency-locked (bandwidth < 100 Hz) to 
the  stabilized  He-Ne  laser  with  an  offset  of  40 MHz.  It 
was then scanned linearly over the saturated resonance by 
changing the offset frequency.

Doppler-free  dispersion  resonances  observed  at  two 
different pressures are presented in Fig. 5. At 6 mTorr the 
linewidth  of 500 kHz can be attributed  to a combination 
of pressure broadening (200 kHz) and medium-term OPO 
frequency jitter (200-400 kHz). At 54 mTorr the observed 
linewidth  of  1.1 MHz 
is  dominated  by  pressure 
broadening.  

In the future, we intend to further reduce the linewidth 
of the OPO by using a more rigid mechanical design and 
a higher bandwidth cavity lock. After these modifications 
we  expect  the  linewidth  of  the  OPO  output  radiation  to 
replicate that of the pump laser (a few kHz). This would 
open up the route to ultra high-resolution spectroscopy of 
a multitude of much narrower Doppler-free spectral lines. 

In particular, one could make use of transitions from low-
lying rovibrational levels of the methane molecule which, 
at  cryogenic  temperatures,  exhibit a  spectroscopic  signal 
which  is  by  2-3  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  that  of 
the  P7  line.12  Using  these  lines  would  lead  to  frequency 
standards of significantly higher performance.  

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new design for a 
pump resonant SRO with a tunable intracavity etalon. The 
idler  frequency  is  continuously  tunable  over  1 GHz  by 
synchronously  changing  the  pump  laser  frequency  and 
tilting  the  etalon.  An  OPO  output  linewidth  of  100 kHz 
was  measured.  The  spectroscopic  capability  of  the  OPO 
has  been  demonstrated  by 
recording  Doppler-free 
resonances in methane.

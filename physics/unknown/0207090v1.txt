Student Resources in quantum mechanics, or why students need 
meta-resources.

We are trying to identify resources students use to reason in quantum mechanics. In this 
process we realize that a student must have not only the right conceptual resources 
available but also sophisticated resources for evaluating and controlling their thought 
processes. We will discuss examples from student interviews to illustrate our point. 
 
Resources 
 

Hammer1  has  given  us  a  useful 
way  of  applying  our  knowledge  of 
to  research  and 
cognitive  structure 
teaching.    He  suggests  we  can  gain 
insight  for  research  and  teaching  by 
looking at students(cid:146) cognitive structures 
as resources for learning.  He compares 
student  learning  to  programming  in  a 
computer  language.      A  programmer 
does  not  have  to  start  from  scratch  in 
machine  language  to  write  a  program.  
There  are  many  resources  she  may  use.  
At  the  level  of  the  operating  language 
some  procedures  and  methods  are 
defined.  In the programming language a 
large  base  of  useful  functions  are 
available  for  the  programmer  and  a 
programmer  will  have  available  a  large 
library of pre-assembled subroutines and 
procedures  that  he  can  insert  to  their 
program as needed.  For the programmer 
these  resources  are  neither  right  nor 
wrong out of the context where they are 
applied;  each  is  useful  in  a  particular 
domain.  Errors arise from applying the 
resource in a domain where it is not well 
suited for the task. 

Similarly students bring to class 
a large library of resources for thinking.  
Some of the things they bring are part of 
their  cognitive  (cid:147)operating  system(cid:148),  like 
the way memory is stored and retrieved.  
Since  this  is  always  on,  it  is  not  a 
resource for student learning. It may still 
be useful for a teacher to understand but

education 
researchers  have  done  much  to  identify 
the  cognitive  structures  students  bring 
with  them  to  physics  class.    Some  like 
Bao4 and diSessa5 have examined details 
of  the  structures  on  a  finer  grain.    We 
can improve research and instruction by 
viewing most of the cognitive structures 
students  bring  with  them  as  resources 
for  learning.    Calling  these  structures 
resources  brings  up  familiar  cognitive 
structures in our own minds that help us 
understand  how 
this  knowledge  of 
student thinking can help us teach. 
 
Resources seen in quantum mechanics 
 

In 

the  quantum  mechanics 
classroom there is a rich and interesting 
variety  of  student  thinking.    We  have 
begun  research  to  look  at  the  resources 
students  use  in  understanding  quantum 
mechanics.   

Two  sets  of  resources  from 
classical  mechanics  are  needed  for 
learning  in  quantum  mechanics:  the 
ideas  about  waves  and 
students(cid:146) 
particles, 
a  number  of 
including 
components  and  sub-ideas.    Students 
may  or  may  not  be  good  at  using  the 

ideas  and  may  not  have  coherent  ideas 
about waves or particles but these ideas 
are  discussed  from  the  start  of  nearly 
every quantum mechanics curriculum.

The  wave  ideas  are  resources

Physics  education  researchers 
have  observed  students  using  a  variety 
of 
from  outside  physics 
contexts  to  negotiate  the  process  of 
constructing the new cognitive structure.  
For  example  Rosenberg6  has  seen

treating the wave function collapse onto 
one  energy  eigenvalue  as  a  person 
deciding  between  two  options,  such  as 
what  to  have  for  dinner.    He  has  seen 
similar behavior in a number of students 
at  various

physics  majors  to  first  year  graduate

students.

suggested  that  the  students  in  his  study 
are  using  the  deciding  resource  from 
personal relationships to de-emphasize a 
this  case  unproductive 
strong, 
cognitive element of object permanence.  
Piaget8 suggests that object permanence, 
the  expectation  that  objects  continue  to 
exist  when  not  directly  observed, 
develops  early  in  children  and  forms  a 
foundation  for  much  of  our  thought 
processes  throughout  our  lives.    This  is 
almost  always  a  good  thing.    There  are 
only  a  few  exceptions,  for  example,  a 
quantum  system  or 
the  state  of  a 
person(cid:146)s mind.  
 
The danger of other resources 
 

The  students 

in  Rosenberg(cid:146)s 
study  used  deciding  as  a  resource 
effectively.    They  used  it  to  distract 
object permanence from the property  of 
energy. There is a large danger here for 
students. 
  If  they  attach  too  much 
significance  this  resource  of  deciding  it 
will  interfere  with  their  reasoning.    For 
example deciding may not be productive 
for  students  in  thinking  about  multi-
particle systems.  (Do the many particles 
make up their collective mind?)

There  is  a  cognitive  minefield 
that  students  need  to  negotiate  as  they 
try  to  construct  an  understanding  of 
quantum  mechanics  from  the  resources 
they  possess  coming  into  class.    Some

instructors 
should

any 
problematic resources9.  To do this they 
ask the students to turn off all their prior 
ideas  and  learn  new  ones.    Continuing 
the  computer  analogy,  this  like  is  the 
instructor (as the programmer) trying to 
use 
the 
students(cid:146)  brains  for  them.  Rosenberg10 
suggests  that  many  of  these  resources, 
such  as  object  permanence,  cannot  be 
turned  off,  and 
that  students  will 
continue  to  try  to  make  sense  of  new 
ideas  using  their  available  resources 
outside of class regardless of how we try 
to  tell  them  to  think.    So  programming 
for them may not be possible.

in  addition 

At this point one could ask, does 
one need a new set of resources to learn 
to 
quantum  mechanics, 
conceptual  resources?    Simply  put,  no; 
they  use  what  they  have  when  they 
come into class.  What we should ask is 
what  do  they  have  when  they  come  in.  
We  have  one  example  already.  Todd, 
using  his  analogy  to  personal  relations, 
noticed  a  conflict  between  his  class 
knowledge and his analogy.  This shows 
that  he  was  aware  of  his  thoughts  and 
was  comparing  them  to  his  memory  of 
class discussion or textbook explanation.  
This  is  a  form  of  metacognition,  being 
aware  of  ones  own  thoughts.    Next,  he 
recognized  that  the  two  threads  had 
different  outcomes.    We  can  view  this 
for 
metacognition 
monitoring  the  use  of  other  resources.  
He  expected  the  two  threads  to  lead  to 
the  same  answer.    He  then  has  to 
evaluate the two ideas.  It seems he may 
expect that knowledge in physics should 
be  coherent,  that  is,  different  paths 
should  lead  to  compatible  ends  and 
ideas  from  different  areas  should  not 
contradict  each  other.    This  type  of 
belief  has been studied by Hammer11 in 
introductory  physics  students.    We  can 
view  these  beliefs  as  resources  for

After  Todd  notices  the  conflict, 
he  tries  to  resolve  it.    He  has  to  decide 
which 
his 
recollection  of  class  or  his  analogy  to 
personal systems.  He chose to stay with 
his analogy.  Another possible course of 
action  would be to look for a third  way 
of  thinking  and  comparing  the  three.  
These  are  more  examples  of  meta-
resources.   

One would then ask if a student, 
coming  into  our  quantum  mechanics 
these  meta-resources 
classroom,  has 
available.    We  think  the  answer  is  yes, 
but not as well developed as they might 
be.  Consider Rich, a sophomore physics 
major  taking  a  modern  physics  class 
focused  mainly  on  quantum  mechanics.  
In  an  interview  we  were  discussing 
using  a  semi-classical  model  for  the 
photoelectric  effect  and  a  traditional 
quantum  model  of  the  same  effect.    In 
the  interview he felt they both  gave the 
same  predictions

explain  how  to  choose  one  model  over 
the  other.  His reply shows some  of the 
resources he used to answer.

 (cid:147)Well  if  you  just  want  to  get  the 
answer  in  this  situation  you  could 
think about it either way but it is the

understanding  what  is  really  going

Conclusions 
 

to  do  well 

Students  have  many  resources 
available  to  learn  quantum  mechanics.  
Some  of  the  conceptual  resources  are 
from their physics knowledge and some 
come  from  other  areas.    In  order  for 
they  need  meta-
them 
resources  for  monitoring,  controlling 
and  judging  their  thought  processes. 
Their conceptual and meta-resources are 
often underdeveloped.

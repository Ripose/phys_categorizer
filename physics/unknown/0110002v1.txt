Abstract

The relativistic corrections to the Maxwellian velocity distribution are needed for standard solar

models. Relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution, if adopted in standard solar models, will lower solar

neutrino  fluxes  and  change  solar  neutrino  energy  spectra  but  keep  solar  sound  speeds.  It  is  possibly  a

solution to the solar neutrino problem.

All standard solar models [1,2] use the Maxwellian velocity distribution to complete the thermal

averages of quantity vs

 estimating the rates of solar nuclear fusion reactions, where v is the magnitudes of

the  relative  velocities  of  interacting  particles  and  s 

is  their  cross  section.  The  Maxwellian  velocity

distribution  is  obviously  inconsistent  with  special  relativity.  Special  relativity  is  a  part  of  the  laws  of

Nature. We need to make the relativistic corrections to the Maxwellian velocity distribution for these well-

constructed  standard  solar  models.  As  the  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution,  the  corrected

distribution  is  expected  to  be  close-fitting  to  the  Maxwellian  distribution  in  the  low-velocity  part,  to  be

substantially  different  from  the  Maxwellian  distribution  in  the  high-velocity  part,  and  to  vanish  at  the

velocity of light.

One might argue that since no significant difference  in  the  low-velocity  part  exists  between  the

Maxwellian distribution and the corrected distribution, since most particles crowd in the low-velocity part

even at the temperatures and densities in the Sun, there will be no significantly different results when we

use whether this one or that one.

This argument is applicable only to the case that most relevant particles crowd in the low-velocity

part  and,  concurrently,  this  low-velocity  part  is  involved  in  statistical  calculations.  The  calculations  of

solar  sound  speeds  are  of  the  case.  The  relevant  particles  are  all  solar  ions.  Most  of  them  crowd  in  the

low-velocity part and this part is involved in the calculations of sound speeds. However, the calculations of

solar nuclear fusion reaction rates, and hence, of solar neutrino fluxes and solar neutrino energy spectra,

do not pertain to the case. To  create  a  nuclear  fusion  reaction,  a  proton  or  a  nucleus  must  penetrate  the

repulsive Coulomb barrier and collides with another proton or nucleus. The height of Coulomb barrier is

far above solar thermal energy: their ratio is typically greater than a thousand [2,3], so most solar protons

and nuclei which crowd in the low-velocity part are forbidden to have a share in nuclear fusion reactions.

Only  few  high-velocity  or  high-energy  protons  and  nuclei  can  participate  in  nuclear  fusion  reactions.  A

difference  in  the  high-velocity  part  between  the  Maxwellian  velocity  distribution  and  the  relativistic

equilibrium velocity distribution may cause significant results.

Velocity space is a space in which point pairs represent relative velocities. In the pre-relativistic

mechanics, the velocity space is represented by

dY2=d

rsdyrdys,  r,s=1,2,3,

in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates  {yr},  r=1,2,3,  where  yr  is  the  well-defined  Newtonian  velocity.  This

velocity space is characterized by (a) unboundedness and (b) the Galilean addition law.

In the special theory of relativity and the modified special relativity theory [4], the velocity space

is described by

dY2=d

rsdy’rdy’s ,  r,s=1,2,3,

in the so-called primed velocity-coordinates {y’r}, r=1,2,3, [4-6] or by

dY2 =Hrs(y)dyrdys,  r,s=1,2,3,
Hrs(y)=c2d

rs/(c2-y2)+c2yrys/(c2-y2)2,  real yr and y<c,

in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates,  where  y=(yryr)1/2,  r=1,2,3,  and  c  is  the  velocity  of  light  [4-7].  The

transformation connecting the primed and the usual velocity-coordinates is,

dy’r=Ar
s(y)=g

[5,6]. This velocity space is characterized by (a) and (b) in the primed velocity-coordinates, and also by (c)

a finite boundary at c and (d) the Einstein velocity addition law in the usual velocity-coordinates. We call

y’r, r=1,2,3, the primed velocity. Its definition from the measurement point of view is given in Ref.[8]. The

Galilean  addition  law  of  primed  velocities  links  up  with  the  Einstein  addition  law  of  corresponding

Newtonian velocities [4,5].

The Euclidean structure of the velocity space in the primed velocity-coordinates convinces us of

the Maxwellian velocity and velocity rate distributions in the primed velocity-coordinates, namely

P(y’1,y’2,y’3)dy’1dy’2dy’3=N(

where N is the number of particles, m their rest mass, T the temperature, and KB the Boltzmann constant.

Using Eqs.(4a-4b) and (5a-5b) in Eqs.(6) and (7), we can find

P(y1,y2,y3)dy1dy2dy3= N

as  the  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  and  velocity  rate  distributions  in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates.

P(y1,y2,y3)dy1dy2dy3  and  P(y)dy  are  so  named  because  they  are  based  on  the  velocity  space  in  special

relativity and the modified special relativity theory.

The  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  and  velocity  rate  distributions  reduce  to  the  Maxwellian

velocity and velocity rate distributions for small velocities. They both contain  a  relatively  depleted  high-

energy tail and vanish at the velocity of light [5,6].

Evidently,  the  nuclear  fusion  reaction  rate  based  on  the  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity

distribution, R, has a reduction factor with respect to that based on the Maxwellian velocity distribution,

RM  is  actually  the  first-order  approximation  of  R.  Since  0<Q< ¥

atomic numbers of the studied nuclear fusion reactions. The relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution,

if  adopted  in  standard  solar  models,  will  lower  solar  neutrino  fluxes  and  change  solar  neutrino  energy

spectra but keep solar sound speeds. It is possibly a solution to the solar neutrino problem.

We study the optical responses of metal nanoparticle chains. Multiple scattering calculations are
used to study the extinction cross sections of silver nanosphere chains of ﬁnite length embedded in a
glass matrix. The transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients of periodic 2D arrays of silver nanospheres
are also calculated to understand the interaction between nanoparticle chains. The results are
in agreement with recent experiments. The splitting of plasmon-resonance modes for diﬀerent
polarizations of the incident light are explored. Results on the eﬀect of disorder are also presented.

INTRODUCTION

II. METHODS AND PARAMETERS

The excitation of surface plasmon on metal nanopar-
ticles has attracted the attention of many researchers
because of many plausible applications such as surface-
enhanced Raman scattering1,2, waveguides3 and non-
linear optics4,5. Recently, many techniques are devel-
oped for the fabrication of metal nanoparticles in form
of clusters and ordered structures.6,7 Metal nanoparticle
chains are of particular interest because they may serve
as building blocks for plasmonic optical waveguides in
nanoscale3.

Previous research has focused on metal nanoparticles
with diameters from tens to hundreds of nanometers. For
metal nanoparticles with diameters d ∼ 10 nm, there
were studies that focused on nanoparticle dimers8–10 and
small clusters11,12. For chains13 of metal nanoparticles
of such a size range, experimentally and theoretically
obtained optical extinction spectra were compared by
Sweatlock et. al. recently14 using ﬁnite integration tech-
niques15 to study the length dependence of the plasmon
resonance frequency of a chain of Ag nanospheres (ﬁxing
d = 10 nm). Here, we present the results obtained by the
Multiple Scattering Theory (MST), which is highly pre-
cise numerically for spherical objects. We also consider
the size dependence, chain-to-chain interaction, as well
as order and disorder issues. In addition, we employ sim-
ple models to understand the optical response of chains
of small metal nanoparticles.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we de-
scribe the methods and the system parameters. Sec. III
gives the calculated results. The extinction spectra of
single silver nanoparticle chains are given with the in-
terpretation using simple models. Then, we discuss the
phenomena due to the interaction of metal nanoparticle
chains and the eﬀect of order and disorder in a chain,
which is followed by the discussion and conclusion in
Sec. IV.

We consider Ag nanospheres (diameter d) embedded in
a glass matrix of refractive index n = 1.61. The dielectric
function of Ag spheres has the form,8,16,17

ε(ω) = εa −

(εb − εa)ω2

,

(1)

where εa = 5.45, εb = 6.18 and ωp = 1.72 × 1016 rad/s.
This dielectric function is a ﬁtting of the literature val-
ues18. The collision frequency γ for d around 10 nm has
the form19

where vF = 1.38 × 106 m/s is the Fermi velocity, l = 52
nm is the electron mean free path at room temperature
and R = d/2. Although there is no consensus among
diﬀerent authors about the proportionality between R
and d,20 the relation R = d/2 is supposedly safe to use.8
We use MST to calculate the optical response of Ag
nanosphere chains. The MST formalism can be found in
details elsewhere21,22. It basically employs vector spher-
ical harmonics to expand the EM ﬁelds, and the solution
of the Maxwell’s equations can be made as accurate as we
please by increasing the angular momentum (L) cut-oﬀ
in our expansion. For single chain of a ﬁnite number of
spheres, we use the MST formulation for a ﬁnite number
of particles21,23. For two-dimensional (2D) arrays, we use
the layer MST formulation for periodic systems22. Un-
less it is speciﬁed, the truncation angular momentum L
in the multipole expansions is 10. We note that all nu-
merical results in this paper are calculated using local
theory only. Nonlocality issues are discussed in Sec. IV.

FIG. 1: Extinction spectra of a chain of Ag nanospheres with
d = 10 nm and σ = 3 nm. Incident wavevector is perpen-
dicular to the chain axis. The curves from bottom to top
correspond to diﬀerent number of spheres from 1 to 10. The
left panel corresponds to “L” mode excitation (electric ﬁeld
parallel to the chain axis). The right panel corresponds to
“T” mode excitation (electric ﬁeld perpendicular to the chain
axis)

spacing σ = 3 nm (center-to-center spacing = 13 nm)
embedded in the glass matrix. We set an incident elec-
tromagnetic plane wave that propagates in the direction
perpendicular to the chain axis. The extinction cross sec-
tions of the chain with the number of spheres N = 1, 2, 3,
. . . , 10 are shown in Figure 1. When there is one single
sphere, an extinction peak is found at the photon energy
of about 3.0 eV. This corresponds to the Fr¨ohlich mode
of the small sphere when the dielectric constant ε of the
sphere matches the condition20

ε = −2εh,

(3)

where εh is the dielectric constant of the surrounding
medium (glass in this case). If we do a multipole expan-
sion of the ﬁeld, the extinction peak corresponds to the
“L = 1” mode (or dipole mode) resonance. The result
shows that higher order multipoles contribute very little
to the extinction cross sections for such small spheres (see
Fig. 2). When N = 2, the extinction peak for the dimer
splits into two for diﬀerent light polarizations. We call
the excitation mode for incident light polarized parallel
(perpendicular) to the chain axis the “L” (“T”) mode ex-
citation. We see that the “L” mode extinction peak shifts
towards a lower frequency (or photon energy) while the
“T” mode peak shifts towards a higher freqeuncy. Sim-
ilar results are obtained theoretically in Ref. 8 and 14
and experimentally in Ref.
14 and 13, and also for
diﬀerent kinds of metal nanoparticles6,24. In addition to
shift of the resonance frequency, a careful examination of
the result also reveal higher order (L > 1) contributions
at about 3.1 eV, but the extintion curves are basically
dominated by the dipole (L = 1) term.

panel is the real part of the dielectric function divided by that

Here, let us ﬁrst present an intuitive explanation of the
shifts of the extinction peak. Fig. 3 shows a schematic
induced charge distribution of a ﬁnite nanoparticle chain
for both the “L” and “T” mode. For a single sphere, the
natural oscillation (with frequency ω0) of the induced
charges is provided by a self-induced restoring force that
is due to the non-uniform surface charge distribution
on its own surface, and the natural frequency is related
to the surface plasmon frequency of a spherical surface.
When the incident light has a frequency close to ω0 (i.e.
at resonance), the extinction is signiﬁcantly enhanced.
It is obvious that when the spheres are suﬃciently close
together (but not in contact), the restoring force magni-
tude on the plasma in each sphere can be signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by others. For “L” mode oscillation, the charge
distribution on the nearest spheres attracts the charge
displaced by the external ﬁeld and reduces the restoring
force, thus reduces the natural oscillation frequency ω0.
In contrary, the charge distribution in the “T” mode os-
cillation increases ω0. Fig. 1 also shows that the peaks
shift in the same way as we further increase N to form a
chain. For a short chain, a further increase in the num-
ber of spheres will further reduce (enhance) the restoring
force for “L” (“T”) mode (see Fig. 3). A plot of the peak
frequency versus N for a ﬁnite chain with σ = 2 nm, 4
nm, 6 nm is shown in Fig. 4 (a). This ﬁgure shows that,
when N is large, the “L” mode and “T” mode approach
to an asymptotic value of about 2.5 eV and 3.09 eV for σ
= 2 nm, 2.7 eV and 3.05 eV for σ = 4 nm, 2.8 eV and 3.03
eV for σ = 6 nm. Let us call these frequencies the long-
chain resonance frequencies. As we can see later, these
values correspond to the long wavelength collective plas-
mon modes of an inﬁnite long chain of metal spheres. We

found that the frequency shift of “L” mode is larger than
that of “T” mode. Therefore, the “L” mode coupling is
stronger than “T” mode coupling for such conﬁguration.
Corresponding ﬁgures for d = 15 nm and 20 nm (with
the same scaling ratio in σ) are shown in Fig. 4 (b) and

4 (c). A summary of the long-chain resonance frequen-
cies obtained here is shown in Table I. These results are
qualitatively the same.

B. Dipolar Model

The results presented in Fig. 1, 2 and 4 are (essen-
tially exact) numerical solution of the Maxwell’s equa-
tions. Here, we employ a simple model to give a semi-
quantitative analysis. Since the full multiple scattering
results show that the optical response is mainly domi-
nated by the dipole (L = 1) terms (see Fig. 1 and 2),
it should be a good approximation to employ a dipo-
lar model. The dispersion relations of a long and inﬁnite
chain of metal nanoparticles using dipolar model has also
been considered by other authors25. We now focus on the
quasi-eigen plasmon modes of a short chain. These are
actually resonance modes since the “eigen”-frequencies
are complex numbers. When there is no external ﬁeld,
the dipole moment of the sphere m induced by other
dipoles is26

The roots of Eq. 8 (eigen frequencies of the system), ωn,
are in general complex25 with Im(ωn) < 0. However,
it may be possible to observe a resonant response at
certain excitation frequency close to Re(ωn) as long as
Im(ωn) is small.
In our case, Im(ωn) ≈ -0.1 eV such
that |Im(ωn)|/|Re(ωn)| < 4% for all ωn that we found.
For the 1D ﬁnite chain of Ag nanoparticles, we have
compared the extinction peak frequency with Re(ωn).
Results for N = 1 to 7 are shown in Fig. 5 (a) and (b).
When there are N spheres, we get N quasi-eigen frequen-
cies satisfying Eq. 6. As the number of spheres increases
and reaches the limit N → ∞, the chain becomes peri-
odic and the quasi-eigen frequencies form a band. The
Brillouin zone boundary and zone center mode freqeun-
cies (for N → ∞) are also shown in the ﬁgures. For
the “L” mode, the band has a positive group velocity
and the zone center (k = 0) mode has a lower frequency
than the zone boundary mode. However, the opposite

= 3 nm together with the extinction peak frequencies (given

and zone center mode freqeuncies (for N → ∞) calculated by
the dipolar model. (c) and (d) show the instantaneous dipole

is true for the “T” mode band that can have a negative
group velocity.25,29 We see that the extinction peak cal-
culated by fully-ﬂedged MST agrees quite well with the
resonance of the quasi-eigen mode at the lowest (highest)
frequency for “L” (“T”) mode of the dipolar model. This

can be explained by the following arguments. The inci-
dent wave is a plane wave with wavevector perpendicular
to the chain axis (i.e. the external incident ﬁeld on all
spheres are in-phase). The quasi-eigen mode with the
largest number of in-phase dipoles thus contributes most
resonant response because the symmetry of the mode is
closest to that of the external incident ﬁeld. Therefore,
for “L” (“T”) mode, the lowest (highest) frequency eigen
mode is the one that can be excited at normal incidence
(see Fig. 5 (c) and (d)).

C.

Interaction of metal nanoparticle chains

We now look at the optical response of Ag nanospheres
in a two-dimensional array. The purpose of doing so is to
study the interaction between nanoparticle chains. In the
experiment of Ref. 13, the sample contains many coupled
nanoparticle chains that are almost aligned in the same
direction. Although the lengths of nanoparticle chains in
the experiment may be short, it is still worth to have a
quantitative study of inﬁnitely long chains for compari-
son.

In this MST calculation, the sphere radii are the same
as those for the nanoparticle chains we discussed. Let
a and b denote the two primitive lattice vectors con-
structing a 2D array. For the purpose to study the chain
interaction, we choose the case a⊥b. When b >> a,
the system will act like an array of independent inﬁnitely
long nanoparticle chains. When b ≈ a, the system can be
considered as a collection of coupled nanoparticle chains.
Calculated transmission, reﬂection and absorption spec-
tra at normal incidence for a = b are shown in Fig. 6.
We see that the dominant reﬂection peak, absorption
peak and the transmission dip are located at the same
frequency (∼2.6 eV), which corresponds to the plasmon
resonant frequency. Again, the dipole response domi-
nates in this case. There are only some small features at
3.2 eV that are due to higher order resonances. In this
case, the consequence of the coupling between nanopar-
ticle chains is a shift in the plasmon resonant frequency.
By varying the ratio between a and b, we can study such
frequency shift due to the coupling between nanoparticle
chains in greater details. We vary the magnitude of b and
repeat the calculations. A plot of the resonant frequen-
cies versus b/a (ﬁxing a and varying b) for two diﬀerent
light polarizations is shown in Fig. 7 (a). Let us deﬁne
σ = a − d. The ﬁgure shows that as b increases, the
“L” mode (E//a) and “T” mode (E//b) resonant peak
shifts from 2.51 eV to the asymptotic values of 2.47 eV
and 3.10 eV for σ = 2 nm, from 2.71 eV to 2.69 eV and
3.07 eV for σ = 4 nm, from 2.80 eV to 2.79 eV and 3.04
eV for σ = 6 nm. Corresponding ﬁgures for d = 15 nm
and 20 nm (with the same scaling ratio in σ) are shown
in Fig. 7 (b) and 7 (c). All these limits obtained from
the graphs agree with the long-chain resonance frequen-
cies obtained for the single ﬁnite chain that we have dis-
cussed in Sec. III A. This consistency is expected because

the limit b >> a for 2D case and the limit N → ∞ for
“single chain” case are both representing non-interacting
nanoparticle chain(s).

Here, we see that the splitting of resonant frequency is
signiﬁcant enough to be observed as long as b/a is greater
than about 2. This is an impoartant criteria of observ-
ing the chain properties in the experiment of Ref. 13. It
is also observed that when the chains are close to each
other (b ≈ a), i.e.
the spheres are arranged in square
lattice, the resonant peaks are still lower than the single
sphere resonance (∼2.96 eV). In this special case, assign-
ing the “L” mode and “T” mode is in fact not suitable
because both “L” mode and “T” mode couplings among
nanospheres are present simultaneously. The situation
then can be considered as a competition between “L” and
“T” mode. From the fact that “L” (“T”) mode tends to
reduce (increase) the resonance frequency, we see that
“L” mode coupling wins over “T” mode coupling. This
is also consistent with Sec. III A that “T” mode coupling
is much weaker than “L” mode coupling. Therefore, it
suggests that the extinction peak will be lower in gen-
eral when the nanospheres are close but not in contact
(σ ∼ 3 nm). Indeed, we found that this is true for many
other 2D structures that we have considered, but this
will not be discussed in details in this paper because we
now focus on the chain properties. Another interesting
feature is that the curves for “T” mode in Fig. 7 cross
the point at b/a ∼ 1.8 with photon energy 2.98 eV. This
frequency is very close to the single sphere resonant fre-
quency. This is where the competition between “L” and
“T” mode coupling ends in a draw.

D. The eﬀect of periodicity

The Ag nanoparticle chains discussed in the previous
sections are arranged such that the center-to-center dis-
tances of adjacent spheres in a chain are the same. One
may be interested in the question that whether this struc-
tural order can produce an extra structural resonance
other than the resonance of individual spheres. For the
parameters that we used previously, the possible extra
resonance should be at a very high frequency such that
the wavelength of the incident light is comparable to the
sphere-to-sphere distances. However, such a high fre-
quency is out of the range of interest of the present arti-
cle. Searching for such eﬀect, we increase the center-to-
center distances to 400 nm.

The extinction spectrum for a 10-sphere chain with d
increases from 10 nm to 100 nm in steps of 10 nm is
shown in Fig. 8. We note that the dielectric functions
of spheres with diﬀerent diameters follow Eq. 1 and 2.
When d = 10 nm, the extinction has no diﬀerence from
that of a single sphere (except the overall amplitude of
the proﬁle). As we increase the sphere diameter, we see
a gradual red shift of the “L = 1” (Fr¨ohlich mode) res-
onance peak. This is a general feature of the Fr¨ohlich
resonance.20 Higher order (L > 1) resonances also ap-
pear near 3 eV when d ≥ 40 nm, and can be traced
to the higher order resonances of a single sphere. Apart
from these known eﬀects, we can see an additional feature
that is due to the structural order. When we increase the
sphere diameters so that d > 80 nm, an extra sharp peak
appears at about 1.88 eV for “T” mode excitation but
not for the “L” mode. Such photon energy corresponds
to a wavelength of 410 nm (close to the sphere-to-sphere
distance) in the host material. This feature30–32 is due to
the constructive interference of the scattered waves from
the nanospheres and cannot be seen from the extinction
spectra of a single sphere. For convenience, we call this

of 10 spheres with center-to-center separation a = 400 nm.
Incident wavevector is perpendicular to the chain axis. The
curves from bottom to top correspond to diﬀerent diameters
from 10 nm to 100 nm in 10 nm increment. Each curve is
normalized in diﬀerent scale so that the resonance frequencies
can be easily compared.

peak a Bragg resonant peak.

Here, we have two points to note. The ﬁrst one is
why “small” Ag nanospheres cannot make a Bragg peak.
The reason is that the extinction spectra of “small” Ag
nanospheres are dominated by absorption while that of
large Ag nanospheres are dominated by scattering.6 The
Bragg peak that we are searching is a consequence of
strong scattering. Therefore, this Bragg peak does not
appear for d around 10 nm. Secondly, the strength of the
far ﬁeld scattered wave of a radiating dipole decays as r−2

in the polar direction while it decays as r−1 in a direction
perpendicular to the polar direction. This explains why
only “T” mode but not “L” mode excitation can make
the Bragg peak.

Using dipolar approximations, some authors shows
that the Bragg peak can be extremely sharp31,32. How-
ever, the sharpness of such peak requires an exact pe-
riodic arrangement of nanospheres. To understand how
such peak is sensitive to disorder, we consider a 20-sphere
linear array. In this example, we have an ensemble of 25
randomly generated conﬁgurations with the diameter of
each sphere d = 100 nm and the center-to-center sepa-
ration given by the expression a = 400 nm + r1 × 40
nm, where r1 is a random number generated uniformly
from −1 to 1. The particular extinction spectrum of
each randomly generated nanosphere array are shown in
Fig. 9. In the same ﬁgure, the averaged extinction spec-
tra (of the 25 conﬁgurations) is also compared with that
of the regular array (with r1 = 0). It is clear that the
resonant peaks at higher frequencies do not depend on
disorder. The curves shown in the ﬁgure are basically
the same in this frequency range (2.25 eV to 3.5 eV). It
is because these peaks are the higher order resonances of
individual sphere. In contrary, the Bragg peak is signiﬁ-
cantly aﬀected by the orderliness of the chain (see Fig. 9
(upper panel)). While the Bragg peak for a perfectly or-
dered chain can be much sharper than the higher order
plasmon resonance peaks, this is only true when we have
perfect chains. Disorder will smooth out the sharp Bragg
features (see Fig. 9 (lower panel)). We note that the
Bragg peak frequency is inversely proportional to the ad-
jacent sphere-to-sphere distance (ωB ∼ 1/a). For a small
change in distance δa, we have ωB +δω ∼ 1/(a+δa), from
which we see that a positive δa gives a smaller red shift
|δω| while a negative δa of the same magnitude gives a
larger blue shift |δω|. Therefore, in the case that r1 being
generated uniformly from −1 to 1, the Bragg peak of the
averaged curve has a blue shift.

E. Disordered ﬁnite chain

In the previous section, we showed that the sharpness
of the Bragg resonance peak is sensitive to random dislo-
cations of the nanospheres. However, such resonance con-
tributes very little to the extinction spectra for the values
of σ and d used in Sec. III A. It thus suggests that the
qualitative feature of extinction spectra should remain
even if there is some randomness in the surface-to-surface
distances, σ, of adjacent spheres. To see the robustness
of the plasmon resonant features that we obtained, we
have also studied an ensemble of 25 randomly generated
conﬁgurations for each polarization. There is a chain of
10 nanospheres in each conﬁguration. Diameter of each
sphere and the surface-to-surface distance are given by,
respectively, the expressions d = 10 nm + r1 × 2 nm and
σ = 3 nm + r2 × 1 nm, where r1 and r2 are random num-
bers generated uniformly from −1 to 1. Note again that

FIG. 9: (Color online) Extinction spectra of Ag nanosphere
chain consisting of 20 nanospheres for “T” mode. The upper

uniformly from −1 to 1. The lower panel shows the average

the dielectric functions of spheres with diﬀerent diame-
ters are diﬀerent according to Eq. 1 and 2. The particular
and averaged extinction spectra are shown in Fig. 10. It
is clear that the diﬀerence of the averaged curve from
the ordered chain is very little. The proﬁle as long as
the center of peak and the peak height are almost not
aﬀected by disorder. An observable diﬀerence shown in
Fig. 10 (b) for “L” mode is a red shift. This can be un-
derstood by referring back to Fig. 7. The results in Fig. 7
show that, for a ﬁxed chain length, the red shift in the
peak frequency with σ reducing from 4 nm to 2 nm is
larger than the blue shift with σ increasing from 4 nm to
6 nm. It suggests that reducing σ has a larger eﬀect than
increasing σ when the amounts of changes in σ are the
same. This explains the red shift in Fig. 10 (b). Using
the similar arguments, there should also be a blue shift
in Fig. 10 (d) for “T” mode, but the shift is too small to
be observed from the ﬁgure. Nevertheless, the little de-
pendence on disorder shows the reason why the resonant
features are still experimentally observable as in Ref. 13.

IV. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION

Using MST, we studied the optical response of Ag
nanoparticle single chains. Our results show that, for
both longitudinal and transverse excitation, the shifts of
the surface plasmon resonant frequency of a short Ag
nanoparticle chain as we increase the chain length are
monotonic and bounded. We have shown that these
properties can be understood semi-quantitatively using

simple models.
It is also shown that the nanoparticle
chain properties are already observable when the chain-
to-chain spacing is greater than twice of the particle-to-
particle spacing in a chain. This result and the disorder
issues discussed in Sec. III E explain why the splitting
phenomena of plasmon resonant band can be observed
experimentally.

The numerical results presented in this paper are the
full multiple scattering calculations which are based on
the Mie theory. We note that we have not yet added
any nonlocal correction in our calculations. Pack et.
al. shows that nonlocal eﬀect due to excitation of vol-
ume plasmon is negligible for two silver spheres of di-
ameter d = 10 nm when the surface-to-surface spacing
σ > 0.4 nm.10 In our present work, σ > 2 nm in glass
(corresponding to σ > 3.2 nm in air) for all the cases we
considered. Therefore, this nonlocal eﬀect should not be
a major correction on our results. Of course, other nonlo-
cal eﬀects are important for nearly contact nanoparticles.
This should be considered in the future.

27 Radiation reaction correction, which adds a term in the
order of x3 (x = size parameter), is necessary when the
dielectric constant ε is real. The ε we used has a non-
negligible imaginary part so that the radiation reaction
becomes negligible. Another correction term that is in the
order of x2 is then more important. Indeed, the most ap-

9

propriate form of α(ω) is the electric dipole coeﬃcient a1
in the Mie theory. In our case, x << 1 and the spheres are
not too close so that using the quasistatic form of α(ω) is
already enough for a good understanding of the problem.
More detailed discussions about the dipole approximations
can be found in Ref. 28.

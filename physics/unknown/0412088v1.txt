The  mathematical  representation  of  the  physical  objects  determines  which 

mathematical branch will be applied during the physical analysis in the systems studied. 

The  difference  among  non-quantum  physics,  like  classic  or  relativistic  physics,  and 

quantum physics, especially in quantum field theory, is nothing else tha n the difference 

between  the  mathematics  that  is  used  on  both  branches  of  the  physics.  A  common 

physical  and  mathematical  origin  for  the  analysis  of  the  different  systems  brings  both 

forms  (quantum  and  classic)  of  understanding  the  nature  mechanisms  closer  to  each 

other.

Introduction 

 

 Inside  any  physical  system  there  are  groups  of  elements  that  are  usually 

considered as individual units that interact with each other, but in whose interior other 

forces intervene that are different from those that are  usually considered at the level of 

the system as a whole. Accordingly, for example, when we study the interactions among 

solids  we  usually  don't  keep  in  mind  the  intermolecular  forces  or  when  we  study  the 

gravitational  interactions  among  planets  we  do  not  take  into  account  the  geologic 

planetary forces.    

 

Usually, this simplification is carried out using transformations (simplifications 

that lead us to symmetries and changes of coordinates based on such symmetries) that 

allow  us  to  obtain  later  on,  simple  and  convenient  expressions  and  solutions  for  our 

systems under study.  

To carry out these transformations (simplifications plus changes of coordinates) 

we  should  “make  a  model”  of  the  physical  objects  we  work  with,  by  means  of  an 

appropriate  mathematical representation. We call these transformations that allow us to 

make a model of an object, the mathematical representation of the physical object. This 

way,  our  physical  system  will  be  formed  by  a  set  of  equations  that  represent  the  real 

physical objects. 

In quantum physics, the physical objects are the particles of the system and the 

mathematical representation of these physical objects is the wave function. However, a 

narrow  relationship  exists  between  the  wave  function  and  the  action  function  of  the 

system, since both of them are maximal representations of the system. This observation 

allows  us  to  obtain,  from  the  classic  analysis  (relativistic)  perspective,  the  complete 

development of the quantum theory of fields.  

 

 

 

Physical systems.  

 
A physical system is defined by a delimited region (cid:31) of 4-space. All the groups 
of points  X  =  (x0,  x1,  x2,  x3)  compose  this  region  that  we  consider  by  definition  to 

conform the system. 

 
A physical magnitude is a degree 3 or 4 scalar, vector, matrix or tensor field that 
is defined inside the system2. When the field is a scalar, this magnitude  m(X) is called 

mass; when the field is a vector, this magnitude is called 4-potential vector e· A(X); …  

 Let P(X) be the linear momentum due to a group of magnitudes. That is to say,  

for scalar and vector magnitudes [1], the form of the linear momentum is: 

P(X) = m(X)· v + eA(X) 

  

On the other hand, a physical system is defined by a function that we call action 

S (traditionally scalar, although of tensor origin  [2], at the moment we will not look at 

its degree) that describes the system at its maximal way. That is to say, if S represents a 

system defined in the  (cid:31) region and  P, as linear momentum, represents the magnitudes, 

then [3] (the negative sign only is traditional): 

This equation comes to say that,  the complete definition of a physical system, to 

which we call action, is defined by the space-time evolution of the physical magnitudes 

that the system contains represented by the linear momentum. 

If we reverse the expression (1) we obtain:

 The maximum degree that a field could have in a space of four dimensions is four 
(Refer to [1] physics/0306134 The action as a differential n-form and the analytic 
deduction of the nuclear potentials ).

This  expression  coincides  with  the  four- impulse  in  classic  theory  of  fields  [4], 

when the action is expressed as a function of the coordinates. This second equation says 

that, the physical magnitudes of a system are the variations or non-homogeneities that 

there are in the system in respect to their four-coordinates. 

Mathematical representation of physical objects. 

  

Usually,  the  expressions  of  physical  systems  use  non-Cartesian  coordinate 

systems.  These  coordinates  are  called  generalized  coordinates  [5].  The  reason  for  the 

coordinates  change  is  to  obtain  simpler  expressions  for  the  system  equations.  We  get 

this observing the symmetries. 

A coordinate change implies the election of some equations

that applied over the sets  Ui (

Using the tensor form of the action [1] of range one, we find:

From  the  expression  (3)  we  deduce  that,  at  first,  there  are  two  ways  to 

understand the physical form of the Ø coordinates:

The first case is the traditional one. In this case the geometric symmetries induce 

a  change  of  coordinates  that  simplifies  the  equations  of  the  system.  The  cylindrical, 

spherical and hyperbolic coordinate transformations belong to this type. 

In the second case we can simplify the equations of the system if we look for a 

transformation that is simple from the action point of view.  

Let  our  system  be  formed  by  physical  objects  in  such  a  way  that,  P  takes 

positive  values  inside  the  physical  objects,  while  its  value  is  zero  outside  of  such 

objects.  In  this  case,  the  function  P(x)  for  each  point  of  Ù,  turns  into  a  distribution 

function for the magnitudes that the system contains at that point.  

In  line  with  the  expression  (3)  the  linear  momentum  P  has  the  form  P(x)  = 

P(Ø(x)). Since  P  characterizes  the  physical  magnitude,  the  function  Ø(x)  represents  a 

distribution function that characterizes the object or objects of the system’s magnitude. 

That is to say:  in  the  transformation  that  simplifies  the expression 

, the function 

jS
k

Ø(x) is the mathematical representation of the system’s  physical objects.  

Quantum theory of fields.  

In quantum theory the objects (particles) come to be represented by a function Ø 

that is called wave function. The square of this function is in fact a distribution function.  

The wave function of a system is a maximal representation of the system, same 

as the action function is. That is to say that both, the action  S and the wave function  Ø 

represent  the  same  physical  concept,  with  the  difference  that  the  action  has  units  of 

power, while the wave function lacks of units. 

An  important  property  in  quantum  field  theory  is  that  the  wave  function  has  a 

tensorial character. This fact, far from being a restriction, actually it is a generalization 

of the concept of wave function in classic quantum mechanics, besides being the natural 

form of deducing the spin concept.

This way, the degree of the wave function tensor speaks to us of the spin of the 

system [6]. A system of zero spin will be defined by a scalar function, that is to say, it is 

a  tensor  wave  function  of  zero  degree  (without  indexes).  A  spin  system  ½  will  come 

defined by a vector function, that is to say, a degree-one tensor wave function (with a 

single index). A spin one system will be defined by a matrix function, that is to say, a 

degree-two tensor wave function (with two indexes)…. For the sake of simplicity in the 

expressions we will use vector notation, keeping into account that this restriction in the 

notation  does  not  suppose  a  restriction  in  the  validity  of  our  expressions  whose 

generalization to a system of generic spin is trivial.  

The  simplest  form  of  relating  the  action  S and the wave  function  Ø  would  be 

making 

=

cte

, meaning a lineal relationship  S j

 ~ Ø j

. The proportionality constant 

S

j

k

will  depend  on  the  relationship  existing  between  the  system  and  the  wave  function. 

Such  differences  are  the  properties  that  we  observe  in  quant um  particles  that 

characterize them against the traditional physical systems. These properties are: 

1.  The  wave  function  represents  a  very  small  object  compared  to  a  traditional 

physical  system;  therefore  we  will  use  a  small  proportionality  constant  having 

units of energy, which is represented by  h . 

2.  The  particles  are  characterized  by  an  oscillating  behaviour  compared  to  the 

systems  that  are  traditionally  considered  static.  Therefore,  such  a  constant 

should contain the imaginary factor 

1-=i

. 

Substituting  these  two  considerations  in  the  relationship  between  S  and  Ø, we

(4) 

The  proportionality  constant  h   has  been  named  the  Planck  constant  [7],  it 

has units of power and it is dependent of the units system that we use. In international 
units system  h  = 1.0545·10 -34 J· s 

obtain [1]:  

 

The expression (4) tells us that  the wave function represents a quantum system 

as  a  whole,  with  the  particularity  that  the  particles,  compared  to  our  traditional

macroscopic  observations,  have  a  lower  magnitude,  equivalent  to  the  Planck  constant 

and a vibratory behaviour.  

We also see that the expression (4) forces us to consider the action as a tensorial 

object  whose  degree  is  equivalent  to  that  of  the  wave  function  of  the  system.  This 

consideration,  same  as  in  the  case  of  the  wave  function,   it  is  a  generalization  of  the 

particular  case  of  the  scalar  action  seen  in  traditional  classic  mechanics.  This  is  even 

more justified than in the equation (3) of the general form of fields theory, whereas in 

quantum  theory  this  tensor  expression  has  a  concrete  physical  reality:  same  as  the 

tensorial wave function, the tensorial action represents the spin of the system.  

The  method  for  passing  from  a  tensor  representation  to  a  scalar  one  is 

performing the corresponding contraction  [2]: 

S

i

.  Applying  the  property 

of tensors whereby the product of two tensors is constant and independent of the change 

in  reference  system  and  keeping  in  mind  that  a  variation  in  the  action  when  this  is  a 

function  of  the  coordinates  is  really  a  coordinates  transform,  we  deduce  that

; mathematical expression of the principle of least action.  

Mathematical representation of physical objects  

 in quantum theory of fields. 

The form by which the contained objects in a system are represented in quantum 

field theory is by means of the wave function. This way, the existent relationship among 

the mathematical representation of the quantum physical object (that is frequently called 

particles assembly) and the system is: 

1.  The assemblies of particles represent very small objects in comparison with the 

usual units of the macroscopic systems.  

2.  The  assemblies  of  particles  are  characterized  by  a  vibratory  behaviour, 

compared to the classic systems in which, in the fundamental state of energy the 

physical objects remain at rest.  

 

 

 

 

 

These properties, as we already saw, lead to the equation (4). If we combine this 

expression with equation (3) generic for field theory, we deduce:

(5) 

These equations represent the canonical quantization.  

From  the  traditional  quantum  point  of  view,  the  expression  (5)  represents  the 

duality between the representation of the particle as a corpuscle in the first term of the 

expression and the particle as a wave in the second term. The particularization for linear 

vector  momentums,  that  is  to  say,  with  a  single  index,  leads  to  the  traditionally  well-

known canonical quantization [8]. 

The step from the expression (5) to the transformations of canonical quantization 

of  non-relativistic  quantum  mechanics  requires  two  additional  considerations:  On  one 

hand,  the  linear  momentum  in  the  non  relativistic  version  is  deduced  from  the  physical-

geometric macroscopic conditions and not starting from the wave function. On the other 

hand the wave function does not represent to the complete system but only the particle 

that  is  being  studied,  considering  the  rest  of  the  system  as  a  macroscopic  object.  The 

result of these two considerations becomes the transformation of the expression (5) into 

the  well-known  transformations  of  canonical  quantization.  If  we  express  them  in 
components and making c· P 0

 = - H being c the light speed and H the Hamiltonian of the 

system, we obtain:

(6) 

When  we  introduce  here  as  wave  function  for  non  relativist  mechanics  the 

function  ø instead of  Ø we want to emphasize the difference among the non relativist 

wave function that represents a single particle inside the system and the relativistic one 

which represents the assembly of particles that constitute the complete system.

Historical reflection.  

The  development  of  the  quantum  and  relativity  theories  took  place  in  a 

contemporary  way  during  the  first  years  of  the  XX  century.  This  way,  the  expression 

(2),  for  any  type  of  metric  could  not  be  deduced  in  a  general  way  before  1915 

(formulation of the General Relativity), while the expressions (6) became known from 

1923  (formulation  of  the  equation  of  Schrödinger).  This  small  time  difference  caused 

that  both  theories  were  developed  in  an  independent  way,  just  as  if  did  not  exist  any 

relationship among them.  

 However, if the expression (2) had been deduced long before, the reasoning that 

leads us from  this equation to the expression (6)  would have become “natural”, in lack 

of  knowing  the  value  of  the  Planck  constant  (just  as  it  happened  with  the  law  of 

Avogadro in which the value of the constant was discovered much later).  

 Regarding the expression (4), the relation between  S and Ø, where the action is 

a magnitude related with the space-time, while the wave function represents the matter, 

can only be deduced in a natural way considering the duality between both concepts. If 

the  space  is  represented  in  a  real  way,  the  matter  should  be  represented  in  a  non-real 

way, that is to say imaginary.  

This form of reasoning is completely similar to the one used by Fermat while he 

was  establishing  the  geometric  optics  in  which  the  iconic  (?) function  y  representing 

the  properties  of  the  light  beam  is  related  with  the  matter  by  means  of  a  relation  that 

involves the imaginary constant: 

f =

yiae

 [4]. 

Conclusion. 

From a mathematical point of view the analysis of a physical system supposes to 

choose  an  expression  for  each  physical  magnitude  and  to  relate  such  expressions  to 

obtain the equations that describe the system to us.  

The  expressions  that  are  used  for  the  physical  magnitudes  will  determine  the 

mathematics’  branch  that  will  be  applied  and  therefore  the  interpretive  apparatus  that 

will allow to translate the mathematical results into physical results.  

Consequently, the unification of the different branches of physics, especially the 

classic and quantum physics, should be focused on the search for common and general 

mathematical representations which simplifications, in function of the properties of the 

systems, are the source of the present diversity of physical theories.

Abstract: The carried out polarization examinations of C10H8 spectrums of small frequencies of 
a  Raman  effect  of  light  has  revealed  the  presence  of  additional  lines  of  small  intensity. 
Calculation  of  histograms  of  spectrums  of  the  lattice  oscillations  is  carried  out  by  Dyne’s 
method. It is shown, that the presence of vacancies in structure of C10H8 leads to occurrence of 
additional lines around 90 cm-1. Occurrence of lines at frequencies less then 30 cm-1 is attributed 
to the presence of orientation disorder of molecules. Apparently, structure C10H8 has both types 
of  defects,  both  orientation  disorder  of  molecules  and  vacancies,  which  causes  occurrence  of 
additional lines in a spectrum of small frequencies.

Previously,  using  the  same  approach  for 
parasubstituted  benzole  [2]  it  has  been 
shown, that the presence of vacancies results 
in  occurrence  of  additional  lines  of  small 
intensity  near  of  70  cm-1.  In  this  paper 
analogous  examinations  for  naphthalene 
crystals (C10H8) are given.

Polarization  examinations  of  spectrums 
C10H8  at  temperature  290  K,  carried  out  in 
the  present  paper,  also  shown  that  in  a 
spectrum  there  are  six  intensive  lines  and  a 
series  of 
intensity  are 
observed.  In  figures  1a  and  1b  components 
(XZ) and (YZ) of the polarized spectrums of 
C10H8 
are  presented.  Frequencies  of 
intensive  lines  are  presented  in  the  Table. 
Also  a  series  of  additional  lines  of  small 
intensity 14.5, 27.5, 31.0, 90.0, and 96.0 cm-
1 is observed.  

For  an  explanation  of  occurrence  of 
additional  lines  in  a  spectrum  of  the  lattice 
oscillations  of  C10H8,  calculations  are 
carried out. Occurrence of these lines can be 
determined  by  the  presence  of  orientation 
disorder  of  molecules  or  by  the  presence  of 
vacancies.  

In  figure  1c  the  histogram  of  spectrum 
C10H8  obtained  by  Dyne‘s  method  with 
orientation  disorder  taken  into  account,  but 
without vacancies. It is clear, that additional 
lines  in  area  below  30  cm-1  appeared  and 
some  lines  are  broadened,  but  there  are  no 
lines in the area of 90.0 cm-1.  

Beside 

the  orientation  disorder 

the 
vacancies  could  be  present  in  the  crystal 
structure.  Results  of  calculations  for  this 
case  are  presented  in  figure  1d.  A  one  can 
see from the figure, on a histogram there are 
lines  about  90.0  cm-1,  and 
additional 
broadening  of  some  lines,  but  lines  in  the 
area lower then 25 cm-1 are not present.

disorder 

Thus  we  assume,  that  the  presence  of 
vacancies  in  the  structure  of  C10H8  affects 
occurrence of additional lines in the field of 
90  cm-1.  Occurrence  of  lines  in  the  area 
lower  then  30  cm-1  is  determined  by  the 
presence 
of 
orientation 
molecules. For both cases broadening of the 
orientation 
lines 
oscillations is found. Hence, the structure of 
C10H8  has  both  types  of  defects,  both 
orientation  disorder  of  molecules  and 
vacancies,  which  causes  occurrence  of 
additional  lines  in  a  spectrum  of  small 
frequencies.

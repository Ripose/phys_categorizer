A simplification of the vorticity equation and an 
extension of the vorticity persistence theorem to 
three dimensions

a)

 

A  simplified  form  of  the  vorticity  equation  for  arbitrary  coordinate 
systems  is  derived.  Using  streamlined  coordinates  it  is  shown  that  in 
steady  three-dimensional  Euler  flow,  as  in  the  two-dimensional  case, 
any component of the vorticity tensor not directed along fluid particle 
trajectories  must  remain  constant  throughout  the  particle  motion.  The 
condition of alignment of the vorticity and angular momentum vectors 
in  steady  vortices  is  studied.  The  viscous  term  in  the  Navier-Stokes 
equation  is  shown  to  be  a  source  of  the  misalignment  of  these  two 
vectors.  Hill’s  viscous  spherical  vortex  overcomes  this  potential 
deterrent  to  steady  flow  by  the  assumption  of  incompressibility.  The 
alignment of the vorticity and angular momentum vectors is compared 
with  organized 
their  misalignment  with 
disorganized  (non-useful) energy. The  geometric (Clifford) product of 
the  two  is  discussed  as  a  possible  unifying  framework  for  the  two 
extremes.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

 
The  Navier-Stokes  equations  present  various  difficulties  to  those  seeking  to  solve 
them. Some numerical solution schemes are limited to two dimensions due, in part, to the 
computational  load  and  large  storage  requirements  associated  with  the  connection 
coefficients  inherent  in  general  coordinate  systems.1,2  It  is  well  known  that  in  two-
dimensional  Euler  flow,  vorticity  is  conserved  along  streamlines.3  Equally  well  known, 
however, is the fact that such a result has not been established for 3D Euler flows.3,4,5 The 
purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  prove  the  above  fact  for  the  3D  case.  In  particular,  it  will  be 
shown  that  in  steady  three-dimensional  Euler  flow,  as  in  the  two-dimensional  case,  any 
component of the vorticity tensor not directed along fluid particle trajectories must remain 
constant  along  particle  paths.  The  key  to  the  proof  is  a  simplification  of  the  nonlinear 
convective terms in the vorticity equation.

help  to  simplify  computations  in  some  numerical  solution  schemes,  particularly  when 
complicated  coordinate  systems  are  used.  For  Euler  flows  in  particular,  it  may  allow  the 
use of more complex three-dimensional coordinate systems without additional overhead.

The  steady  continuity  equation  given  in  (7)  states  that  the  Lie  derivative  of  the 
 
quantity 
  in  the  direction  of  the  fluid  velocity  is  zero.  Consequently,  in  order  to 
integrate  this  equation,  one  of  the  coordinates  in  the  coordinate  system  should  coincide 
with the direction of the fluid velocity. Therefore, writing (7) for a streamlined coordinate

V. A CONDITION BETWEEN VORTICITY AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM 

As  shown  in  the  previous  two  sections,  both  the  angular  momentum,  l,  and  the  off-
 
trajectory components of the vorticity tensor, ω, are constant along streamlines in steady 
flow. The only caveat is that with the vorticity, this can only be guaranteed if the flow is 
inviscid  or  the  Laplacian  in  the  viscous  term of  the  vorticity  equation*  is  zero,  while  for 
angular  momentum  it  is  true  in  general.  (Recall  that  in  inviscid  flow,  the  entropy  also 
remains constant along streamlines.) In fact, the alignment of these two tensors may be a 
measure of the useful energy contained within the vortex. 

                                                
 
* This does not require, however, that the viscous term of the Navier-Stokes equation be zero.

. The axes of the vorticity, ω, and the angular

momentum, L, are not necessarily parallel. When they are not, the “product” in (13) does 
not  represent  all  of  the  kinetic  energy.  A  problem  often  faced  by  the  engineer  is  that  of 
balancing rotating machinery. When a rigid body rotates about some axis not parallel to its 
angular  momentum  vector,  the  body  begins  to  wobble.  The  vibrations  induced  by  this 
misalignment of the axis of rotation (the vorticity) and the axis of angular momentum can 
become  violent  and  can  lead  to  mechanical  failure  if  left  unchecked.  The  break  up  of  a 
vortex ring or a pair of standing eddies in nominally two-dimensional bluff-body flow may 
likewise  be  the  result  of  a  slight  misalignment  of  the  vorticity  and  angular  momentum 
vectors.  Therefore,  when  seeking  steady  solutions  to  the  Navier-Stokes  equations,  it  is 
reasonable to seek for those that can maintain this alignment. 

 
It can be seen from (6) that, were it not for the viscous term in the steady momentum 
equation,  the  off-trajectory  components  of  vorticity  would  remain  constant  along  each 
streamline, just as the angular momentum remains constant. Therefore, the viscous term is 
a source of misalignment of the vorticity and angular momentum vectors. 

Hill’s  spherical  vortex  can  be  used  to  shed  further  light  on  the  question  of  the 
 
alignment of 
 and l. The pressure field in the core of Hill’s spherical vortex, found by 
substituting the appropriate derivatives of the velocity field (see e.g., ref 6) into the Navier-
Stokes equations and integrating, is:

Hill’s spherical vortex is sometimes referred to in the literature as an inviscid solution, 
 
but the core is actually a viscous flow. Note that the viscous contribution to the pressure 
field of the spherical vortex contains the quantity, z, which is the streamwise distance from 
what would otherwise be a symmetry axis. Therefore, the effect of the viscous term is to 
break  mirror  symmetry  about  the  y-axis.  In  a  real  flow,  density  is  affected  by  this 
asymmetry  in  the  pressure  field  so  that  the  angular  momentum  calculated  by  (9)  would 

 

5

become slightly misaligned with the vorticity field, which remains symmetrical about the 
y-axis. (In a real flow, the streamline pattern created by the vorticity field probably adjusts 
slightly  in  response  to  this  misalignment  if  the  angular  momentum  is  not  too  great.)    In 
Hill’s solution, the assumption of incompressibility removes this density dependence and 
preserves the alignment of ω and l in spite of the asymmetrical pressure field induced by 
the  viscous  term.  Taking  the  curl  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  to  obtain  the  vorticity 
equation discards the asymmetric pressure field. As shown above, misalignment of ω and l 
requires  the  presence  of  the  viscous  term  and,  therefore,  probably  requires  the  unsteady 
term as well. Since the viscous mechanism appears to be related closely with the unsteady 
term,  a  viscous  splitting  technique,  wherein  the  viscous  term  is  solved  together  with  the 
unsteady term and the left side of (5) is solved separately, may hold promise. For a review 
of  other  viscous  splitting  techniques,  see  ref.  3,  p.  119-129.  The  Oseen  solution7  is  an 
example  of  such  a  splitting.  The  Oseen  solution  satisfies  (4),  which  in  streamlined

Equation  (5)  shows  that  when  the  viscous  term  is  zero  in  a  steady  flow,  which  can 
 
occur either when 
, the alignment of the angular momentum and 
the off-trajectory vorticity (or more precisely, the projection of these two tensors out of the 
streamwise  direction)  must  remain  constant  along  streamlines.  If,  as  for  Hill’s  spherical

vortex,  the  alignment  is  maintained  by 
,  then  any  asymmetries  remaining  in  the 
pressure field may be decoupled from the angular momentum field by a constant-density 
assumption. If, on the other hand, neither of these conditions exists, then the viscous term 
is  non-zero,  and  if  the  alignment  is  to  be  preserved,  the  non-zero  viscous  term  must  be 
offset by including the unsteady term (or a body force), as in the Oseen solution.

VI.  ENERGY 

Energy is usually thought of as being of two types: 1) organized, useful energy, or that 
 
capable of doing useful work, and 2) disorganized or chaotic energy, which is considered 
to  be  thermal  energy.  It  was  stated  in  the  previous  section  that  the  alignment  of  ω  and  l 
may  be  a  measure  of  the  organized  or  useful  energy  contained  within  the  vortex. 
Correspondingly,  their  misalignment  may  be  a  measure  of  disorganized  or  non-useful 
energy.  The  conversion  process  from  organized  energy  to  disorganized  energy  is 
irreversible. As is well known, heat cannot be converted entirely and reversibly into work. 
The  rotational  energy  of  a  rotating  fluid  is  capable  of  doing  useful  work  until  it  is 
dissipated into thermal energy, at which point it can only be reorganized back into useful 
energy  by  incurring  a  conversion  penalty.  The  conversion  process  from  organized 
rotational  energy  to  disorganized  (thermal)  energy  was  shown  above  to  begin  with  the 
misalignment  of  l  and  ω  caused  by  the  viscous  term.  The  fact  that  the  viscous  term 

 

6

irreversibly  misaligns  ω  and  l  seems  to  suggest  an  association  more  with  the  2nd  law  of 
thermodynamics rather than the first law. Beltrami flow (
), whose streamlines are 
considered chaotic,8 is likely to have a higher entropy per unit energy per unit volume than 
complex-lamellar flow. In Beltrami flow, l and ω are maximally misaligned.

VII.  CONCLUSION 

 
The  general  vorticity  equation  is  simplified  by  a  complete  cancellation  of  all 
Christoffel  symbols  from  the  nonlinear  convective  terms.  The  known  persistence  of 
vorticity  in  steady  2-dimensional  Euler  flow  is  extended  to  the  3-dimensional  case.  In 
particular, off-trajectory components of the vorticity tensor in a steady 3-dimensional Euler 
flow  remain  constant  during  fluid  motion.  It  is  also  shown  that  in  the  absence  of  body 
forces, the viscous term in a steady momentum equation is the source of misalignment of 
the off-trajectory vorticity components relative to those of the angular momentum vector, 
which are also constant along streamlines. This is illustrated using Hill’s spherical vortex, 
whose pressure field possesses an asymmetry that is proportional to viscosity. If not for the 
constant-density  assumption,  this  asymmetry  in  the  pressure  field  would  impact  the 
density,  and  hence  the  angular  momentum,  and  hence  the  latter’s  alignment  with  the 
vorticity vector. The alignment of these two vectors is discussed as indicator of the quality, 
organization, or usefulness of energy.

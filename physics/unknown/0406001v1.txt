Using  analytical  modeling  and  detailed  numerical  simulations,  we 

investigate properties of hybrid systems of Photonic Crystal micro-cavities 

which  incorporate  a  highly  non-linear  Ultra  Slow  Light  medium.  We 

demonstrate  that  such  systems,  while  being  miniature  in  size  (order 

wavelength),  and  integrable,  could  enable  ultra-fast  non-linear  all-optical 

switching at single photon energy levels. 

For  many 

important  applications 

(e.g.  quantum 

information  processing, 

integrated all-optical signal processing etc.) it would be highly beneficial to have strong 

and  nearly  instantaneous  interaction  of  light  with  light,  preferably  happening  in  a 

minimal volume. This can be achieved, in principle, by exploiting intrinsic material non-

linearities. Unfortunately, such non-linearities are well known to be extraordinarily weak, 

thus one is forced to make undesirable compromises on interaction time, device-length, 

and/or power. To optimize the effects, we combine two approaches to enhance optical 

non-linarities.  One  is  structural:  we  design  a  structure  whose  geometrical  properties 

enhance  the  non-linear  interaction;  due  to  their  extraordinary  opportunities  for 

controlling  the  flow  of  light,  photonic  crystals  (PhCs)  [1,2,3],  have  been  proven  to  be 

particularly  suitable  for  this  purpose  [4,5,6,7].  The  other  approach  is  to  use  an  Ultra 

Slow  Light  (USL)  medium  with  extremely  large  non-linear  optical  response.  Non-linear 

Kerr coefficients 12 orders of magnitude larger than in AlGaAs have been measured in 

such  systems  [8].  In  this  letter  we  demonstrate,  through  analytical  theory  and  detailed 

numerical simulations, how combining the structural non-linearity enhancement offered 

by  PhC  cavities  together  with  USL  effects,  can  lead  to  all-optical  switches  of 

1

unprecedented characteristics; such switches can be less than λ3 in size, with switching 

times faster than 100ps, and operating at single photon levels. 

Let  us  begin  with  a  simple  argument  of  how  such  a  device  would  operate. 

Imagine  a  resonant  cavity  with  one  input,  and  one  output  port,  and  narrow  resonant 

transmission  (POUT(ω)/PIN(ω))  width  Γ=ωRES/2Q,  where  Q  is  the  quality  factor  of  the 

cavity, and ωRES is the resonant frequency. In order to perform switching of an incoming 

probe field, one applies a stimulus to change the index of refraction n inside the cavity, 

thereby shifting the resonance width by δωRES/ωRES~δn/n. The switching requirement is: 

δωRES>Γ. So, the larger the Q, the smaller the required δn is. Imagine that δn is induced 
through a non-linear Kerr effect by some other (control) field E: δn∝n2|E|2, where n2 is 

the Kerr coefficient of the underlying material. If the incoming power of the control field 

is

  is  the  modal  volume  of 

the  cavity,  and  EMAX  is  the  peak  electric  field  in  the  cavity.  Combining  all  this,  we 
conclude  that  the  power  needed  to  operate  the  device  is  P∝n2VMODE/Q2;  one  Q-factor 

comes from the field-enhancement effects inside of the cavity, while the other Q-factor 

comes  from  decreased  δn  requirements  due  to  the  narrower  resonance  width.  It  is 

important  to  emphasize  that  (in  contrast  to  what  typically  happens  in  electronic 

switching  schemes,)  the  energy  in  the  fields  is  not  actually  absorbed,  but  rather  re-

directed  during  the  switching  processes:  it  does  not  cause  heating  of  the  system,  and 

could  even  be  reused.  PhCs  enable  microcavities  that  can  have  small  modal  volumes 

and large Qs at the same time, thus providing optimal all-optical switching geometries. 

When  implemented  in  AlGaAs,  at  λRES=1.55µm,  and  Q=4000,  such  switches  can 

operate  with  P≈5mW  [6].  Therefore,  if  USL  (whose  n2  can  be  12  orders  of  magnitude 

larger  than  n2  of  AlGaAs  [8])  is  used  as  non-linear  medium  in  such  cavities  instead  of 
AlGaAs, power levels as low as P~10-15W might be achievable. The point of this letter is 

to  demonstrate  that  systems  of  the  class  we  describe  here  are  very  natural  for 

implementing  extremely  low  power  all-optical  signal  processing.  To  our  knowledge, 

 

2

single-photon  non-linear  behavior  of  cavity-EIT 

(Electro-magnetically 

Induced 

Transparency) has only been discussed qualitatively using generic or heuristic models 

[9,10,11]. In this letter, we present results of realistic numerical experiments (including 

material and radiative losses) on an exemplary system of a PhC microcavity containing 

a  single  USL  atom.  In  particular,  we  perform  finite  difference  time  domain  (FDTD) 

simulations with perfectly matched layer (PML) boundary conditions [12], which simulate 

Maxwell’s  equations  (including  dispersion)  for  such  a  system  exactly  (apart  for  the 

discretization).  Such  simulations  are  known  to  be  able  to  reproduce  true  experimental 

results very faithfully (hence the term “numerical experiments”), so the work presented 

here  should  act  as  a  motivation  to  implement  the  systems  we  study  in  a  true 

experimental setting.    

For ease of fabrication, consider a PhC microcavity, as shown in Figure 1. This is 

a  hybrid  configuration,  where  the  resonance  is  confined  laterally  by  index-guiding  and 

axially  by  the  1D  PhC  gap.  For  simplicity,  we  model  a  2D  system,  since  the  essential 

physics is the same as that of its 3D counterpart, but numerical requirements are now 

much  more  tractable.  The  microcavity  in  Figure  1  has  only  a  single  resonance  that  is 

equally (and weakly) coupled to an input and output waveguide with:

where  POUT&PIN  are  outgoing&incoming  powers,  ΓIO, ΓRAD,  and ΓABS  are  respectively, 

the widths due to coupling to the waveguides, loss from the cavity due to the coupling to 

the  free-space  radiation  modes,  and  the  intrinsic  material  absorption,  and ωRES  is  the 

resonant frequency. We neglect the absorption of the host material (but not of the USL 

material) since it is typically small, and the presence of USL material does not increase 

its effects [17]. In that case, the transmission through the cavity is given by the dashed 

blue curve in Figure 2. If there were no radiation losses (ΓRAD=0), this curve would peak 

at 100% transmission. 

Consider  now  the  presence  of  a  single  USL  atom  [13]  at  the  center  of  the 

microcavity.  This  could  be  implemented  by  using  AFM  techniques,  solid-state  USL 

 

3

materials [14], or a single-gas-atom PhC microcavity [15]. The relevant atomic levels of 

such an atom are shown in Figure 3A. In general, one would need ensure that each of 

the relevant atomic transitions coincides with an even resonant mode of the cavity. (E.g. 

for  the  particular  system  of  Figure  1,  the  resonance  is  even  and  all  transitions  would 

have  to  fit  within  its  single  resonance  width,  which  is  ≈ωRES/692).  Next,  one  would 

introduce a coupling field at frequency ω23 into the cavity, in order to establish USL for 

the  probe  frequencies  ω  which  are  close  to  the ω13  transition.  The  polarizability  of  a 

typical USL atom is shown in Figure 3B.  

 

Introduction  of  a  highly  dispersive  polarizable  object  into  a  cavity  has  two 

important  effects.  First,  it  changes  the  resonant  frequency  of  the  cavity.  According  to 

perturbation theory [6]:

where  the  induced  dipole  moment  p=αE  (here,  E  is  the  electric  field  at  the  position  of 

the  dipole,  and α is the atomic polarizability), VMODE is the modal volume, and ε is the 

dielectric constant of the host medium. Note that since α is in general complex, Eq.(2) 

also  causes  an  effective  change  in  ΓABS  as:

systems  of  interest  this  effect  will  be  barely  noticeable,  but  we  include  it  here  for 

completeness. Second, this object results in a change of geometry of the cavity, thereby 

modifying  its  coupling  to  the  free-space  radiation  modes  (ΓRAD).  For  most  cavities,  the 

change in ΓRAD will also be unnoticeable. Still, it can be understood as follows. Usually, 
power scattered by an induced dipole is ∝|p|2. However, in our case, both the induced 

dipole, and the cavity mode itself scatter out of the cavity a significant portion of power 

into  the  same  single  mode  (dipole  far-field  radiation  expansion).  Consequently,  their 

fields  (rather  than  powers)  add,  and  the  change  in  the  radiated  power  ∆PRAD  has  a 

component  linear  in  p.  Since  Re{α}»Im{α}  for  a  typical  USL  application,  we  can 

approximate:  

ΓRAD≈ΓRAD(p=0)+ξRe{α}+…

where, ξ is determined by the geometry of the cavity, and has to be calculated for each 

cavity separately: one simulates systems with a few different values of α, and fits ΓRAD 
to a straight line. For our 2D cavity from Figure 1, we calculate ξ≈0.0012c/(a3ε0).    

The enormous dispersive behavior [8] like the one shown in Figure 3B drastically 

narrows the transmission resonance width of the cavity for probe frequencies ω close to 

ω13.  Intuitively,  the  large  dispersion  implies  low  group  velocity,  so  each  “bounce” 

between the two mirrors of the cavity takes longer time, meaning that the light spends 

longer time in the cavity. For the particular case of the dipole shown in Figure 3B, the 

FDTD  calculation  of  narrowing  gives  a  factor  of  ≈3.3  [16],  as  shown  by  the  solid  blue 

line in Figure 2. Despite the fact that the light spends much more time in the cavity, the 

coupling  to  the  free-space  radiation  modes  is  not  increased  [17],  so  the  peak 

transmission is unchanged. A way to see that this has to be so is to note that since ω13 

coincides with ωRES, the induced dipole moment is zero at ωRES, so the system behavior 

(and  hence  its  peak  transmission)  is  unchanged  at  that  particular  frequency.  The 

behavior of the system can also be well described with our analytical model, as shown 

by the black dashed line coinciding with the solid-blue curve in Figure 2. 

Finally,  we  introduce  an  additional  third  (control)  field  into  the  cavity,  with  a 

frequency close to ω24, in order to perform the switching of the probe field ω [18,19,20]. 

Presence of this control field causes a Stark shift of level |2〉, thereby sliding the whole 

dispersion  curve  in  Figure  3B  sideways.  This  switching  behavior  is  displayed  by  red, 

green, and magenta curves in Figure 2; the corresponding dashed black lines represent 

the results of the analytical modeling of the system. Clearly, perturbation theory models 

the true behavior very faithfully.  

 

We can now use the analytical model to understand the behavior of such devices 

in various USL parameter regimes. We start by writing the expression for α of an USL 

atom, for ω close to ω13 using arguments similar to those of Refs. 21 and 22:

the  same  as  the  peak  transmission  of  the  cavity  without  the  USL  atom.  Thus,  despite 

the extreme width-narrowing, and irrespective of the Ω24-induced resonance shifts, the 

peak  transmission  is  always  the  same.  Consequently,  the  somewhat  worrisome  effect 

(apparent by the green curve in Figure 2) of reduced transmission during the switching 

operation  disappears  as  one  operates  in  the  regime  of  strong  USL  effects  (c/vG»1). 

Furthermore,  for  properly  designed  microcavities,  and  properly  implemented  USLs, 

 

6

absorption (term proportional to Γ3 in Eq.(6)), and changes to the cavity geometry (term 

proportional to ξ in Eq.(6)) can both be neglected. Thus, the width of the transmission 

curve  (Eq.(6))  is  given  by   ≈[ΓIO+ΓRAD(p=0)](vG/c),  so  the  narrowing  factor  is ≈vG/c.  To 

obtain switching, we need to shift the resonance by more than its width:

The optimal efficiency of our systems is now apparent from Eq.(7). The right hand side 

of the equation is the transmission width of the cavity without the USL atom present: the 

larger  its  Q,  the  more  efficient  the  system  is.  The  left  hand  side  is  just  the  Kerr-effect 

induced change in the resonant frequency of the cavity. The strength of this Kerr-effect 
~ω∆   can  be 

is  greatly  enhanced  because  of  three  factors:  (c/vG)  can  be  made  large, 

24

made  small  (so  we  are  exploring  non-linearities  close  to  the  resonance  which  one 

cannot  do  in  usual  non-linear  systems  because  of  huge  absorption),  and  for  a  given 

incoming power P24, the cavity enhancement effects and the small modal volume both 

make Ω24 large.   

 

Before concluding, we estimate quantitative performance characteristics of a 3D 

device of the type we describe. First, we assume that the modal extent in the direction 

out  of  the  page  in  Figure  1  is  roughly  the  same  as  the  modal  extent  in  the  direction 

perpendicular  to  the  waveguide  in  the  plane  of  the  figure.  This  gives  an  estimate  of 

VMODE≈0.009λRES

3.  As  an  example,  we  will  use  a  resonance  of  the  sodium  atom  with 

λRES=589nm. We assume resonance-narrowing factor due to USL of c/vG≈30, leading to 

a transmission width (and hence the available operational bandwidth in ω) ≈25GHz. (For 

comparison,  if  we  chose  to  use  the  experimental  parameters  of  Ref.8,  the  narrowing 
factor  would  be  >107!)  To 
implement  switching, 
is: 
|Ω24|2/|∆ω24|>25GHz  [13].  So,  if  we  take  ∆ω24=60GHz  (which  would  provide  us  with 

induced  Stark  shift 

the 

∼10GHz operational bandwidth for the control field), the needed intensity of the control 

field  in  air  (for  sodium)  would  be  I24≈50GW/m2  [8],  while  the  field  inside  the  cavity  is: 
|E24|2=2I24/(cε0). The needed input power P24=ωRESU24/(2Q24)=(επVMODEI24)/(2ε0λRESQ24), 

where U24 is the control field’s modal energy, and Q24≈692 is its transmission Q for the 

 

7

cavity of Figure 1. We conclude that P24≈4.3µW. With similar reasoning, we can show 

that  the  power  in  the  coupling  field  needs  to  be  PC≈10µW.  Finally,  the  number  of  the 

control-field photons needed to be present in the cavity in order to induce the switching 

is

.  Each  of  these  photons  spends  ~2ps  in  the  cavity,  while  the 

switching time is ~100ps; so the switching is performed by a total of N24~500 photons. 

By  exploring  even  more  extreme  regimes  of  USL  parameters  and/or  higher  Q  PhC 

cavities  (Q=45000  PhC  micro-cavity  has  been  demonstrated  experimentally  recently 

[23]),  one  can  easily  reach  the  single-photon  optical  non-linearity  operation  regime, 

which has been elusive thus far. 

 

In  conclusion,  we  describe  a  class  of  microcavity  devices  with  extraordinary 

optical  non-linear  properties.  Of  course,  physical  implementation  of  such  systems  will 

entail  overcoming  many  technical  hurdles  (e.g.  identifying  an  optimal  atomic  system, 

matched  to  the  desired  operational  wavelength,  etc.)  As  noted  above,  extremely  low 

power levels required for optical non-linearities with the proposed hybrid system would 

allow exploration of an exciting new physics regime where, e.g. quantum fluctuations in 

the fields should be an important non-linear effect. Moreover, such devices could prove 

useful  for  all-optical  quantum  information  processing.  Finally,  it  would  be  interesting  to 

explore  the  possibility  that  USL  could  be  automatically  established  in  some  solid-state 

single-atom systems, even if one does not apply the coupling field: the electric field of 

the host material could (under proper conditions) play the role of the coupling field.

narrowing  the  length  of  its  two  neighboring  thin  elements  to  0.25a.  The  incoming  and 

outgoing waveguides have thickness 0.55a. The runs are performed at a numerical grid-

resolution of 40pts/a. Consistency is checked at 20pts/a, and 80pts/a.

and  green  (ω13→ω13∗1.003).  The  dashed  black  curves  are  predictions  of  the 

perturbation  theory  for  their  corresponding  curves:  they  are  obtained  as  follows.  First, 

we  assume  linear  dependence  of  Re{α}  close  to  ω13,  and  quadratic  dependence  of 

Im{α}  close  to ω13,  with  fit  parameters  obtained  from  Figure  3B;  these  are  needed  for 

Eq.(2). Second, with a series of independent FDTD calculations we obtain a linear fit to 

ΓRAD  in  Re{α},  as  required  by  Eq.(3).  Next,  we  obtain ΓIO,  and ωRES  from  the  dashed 

blue  curve  above,  and  calculate  VMODE  with  an  independent  simulation.  Finally,  we 

substitute the expressions obtained by Eqs.(2)&(3) in this manner into Eq.(1), in order to 

obtain the black dashed curves shown here.

13   Since there is only one atom, the Doppler broadening in gaseous USL systems, 
or  the  inhomogeneous  broadening  in  solid-state  systems  (e.g.  5GHz  in  Pr:YSO 
[14]) due to the host is not an issue anymore, while the remaining uncertainty in 
the  exact  level  positions  (because  of  the  influence  of  the  host,  or  because  of 
Doppler broadening) can be much smaller than the cavity resonance width.

In our numerics, we model the USL atom as a small-area object (2.4∗10-4λRES
with  large,  highly-dispersive  susceptibility.  The  required  dispersion  shape  is 
obtained with two absorption lines sandwiching a gain line; such a shape closely 
resembles a typical USL dispersion.

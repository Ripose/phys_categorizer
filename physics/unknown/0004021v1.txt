Introduction

In the past three decades the thermal noise spectroscopy was recognized as a fruitful tool of

space plasma diagnostics. It is well-known that when a passive electric antenna is immersed into a

stable plasma, the thermal  motion of the ambient  electrons  and  ions  produces  fluctuations  of  the

electric  potential  at  the  antenna  terminals  [Rostoker,  1961;  Andronov  ,1966;  De  Passiz,  1969;

Fejer  and  Kan,  1969].    This  quasi-thermal  noise  may  be  calculated  if  the  particle  velocity

distribution  function  is  known  [Rostoker,  1961].  Since  the  noise  spectrum  depends  on  the  main

characteristics  of  plasma,  as  electron  density  or  bulk  temperature,  the  quasi-thermal  noise

spectroscopy  can  be  used  for  diagnostics  of  plasma  parameters.  This  diagnostic  method  is  most

appropriate  for  in  situ  space  plasma  measurements  because  it  does  not  require  of  additional

apparatus; large scale space plasma conditions allow one to construct antennas whose impedance is

very small as compared with input impedance and whose characteristics can be calculated with fair

accuracy.  Such  antennas  permit  direct  observation  of  the  frequency  spectrum  of  thermal  noise.

Some  examples  of  application  of  this  diagnostic  method  can  be  found,  for  example,  in  [Meyer-

Vernet, 1979; Couturier et al., 1981; Kellog, 1981; Meyer-Vernet and Pershe, 1989].

It is also well known that random  irregularities  of  electron  density  always  present  in  real

space  plasma.  Random  irregularities  of  the  Earth's  ionosphere  are  studied  intensively  and  main

properties of their spatial spectrum are known [Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Szuszczewicz, 1986]. These

irregularities considerably affect propagation of radio waves in space plasma changing their phase,

amplitude, spatial and angular distribution [Zabotin, Bronin and Zhbankov, 1998], as well as group

propagation  time  and  pulse  duration  [Bronin,  Zabotin  and  Kovalenko,  1999].  Some  information

about the  irregularity  spectra  of  solar  wind  is  also  available  [Rickett,  1973].  For the  purposes  of

present  investigation  it  is  possible  to  use  twin  models  of  shape  of  spatial  spectrum  for  both

ionospheric and solar wind irregularities. Though that does not relate to parameters of the spectra.

Irregularities  substantially  change  properties  of 

the  medium  with 

relation 

to

electromagnetic  radiation  and  they  may  also  influence  quasi-thermal  noise  spectrum  detected  by

2

antenna. What is the possible physical mechanism of this influence? It is known, that fluctuations

in  plasma  are  closely  connected  with  plasma  dissipative  properties.  From  the  viewpoint  of

statistical mechanics, random irregularities in plasma may be understood as non-thermal large scale

(in comparison with characteristic time and scale of particle motion) fluctuations. Such fluctuations

may  considerably  change  collision 

term 

in  kinetic  equation  [Klimontovich,  1982]  and,

consequently, velocity distribution function. Since the quasi-thermal noise spectrum is determined

by  velocity distribution  function, the change  in distribution  function  will  lead  to  change  in  noise

spectrum.  From  the  viewpoint  of  electrodynamics,  random  irregularities  change  mean  dielectric

properties  of  the  medium  (see,  for  example,  [Hagfors,1984]).  It  means  that  in  the  media  with

random irregularities the roots of dispersion equation are shifted with relation to undisturbed values

and  even  new  roots  may  appear.  The  imaginary  part  of  these  roots  may  also  be  considerably

changed  due  to  additional  non-collisional  attenuation  caused  by  scattering  of  waves  in  random

medium.

Development of strict theory  of  influence  of  random  irregularities  on  quasi-thermal  noise

spectrum is a very complicated and difficult task, involving various fields of electrodynamics and

statistical physics. In the present paper we will assume that noise spectrum in the random medium

may be calculated using the tensor of effective dielectric permittivity. This tensor is determined as

the dielectric permittivity tensor of some imaginary "effective" regular medium in which the field

of  point  source  is  the  same  as  the  mean  field  in  the  corresponding  random  medium  [Ryzhov,

Tamoikin  and  Tatarskii,  1965,  Ryzhov  1968].  Since  effective  dielectric  permittivity  tensor

determines  the  mean  field  of  the  source  in  random  media  it  also  determines  the  impedance  of

antenna, which in its turn, determines the noise spectrum. It has been shown also that correlation

function of electric  field  fluctuations  in  random  medium  may  be  expressed  through the  effective

dielectric constant tensor [Ryzhov, 1968]. (It should be noted, however, that this result is based on

averaging  of  Kallen-Welton  formula  and  is  valid  only  for  states  near  the  thermal  equilibrium.)

Spectrum  of  electrostatic  noise  in  its  turn  is  completely  determined  by  correlation  function  of

longitudinal  electric  field  [Meyer-Vernet  and  Pershe,  1989].  The  method  based  on  effective

dielectric constant tensor was used to study thermal noise spectrum in dielectrics [Ryzhov, 1970].

We apply this approach to the irregular space plasma.

Calculation of the effective dielectric permittivity tensor of plasma  is also rather complex

problem  involving  summation  of  infinite  series  of  perturbation  theory.  Some  approximation  is

necessary  to  get  the  tensor  components  in  closed  form.  In  this  paper  we  follow  Born

approximation.

Thus,  in  the  present  paper  we  intend  to  estimate  possible  changes  in  the  thermal  noise

frequency spectrum in plasma with random irregularities rather then to develop complete and strict

3

theory of this effect. In Section 1 of the paper we briefly discuss calculation of the noise spectrum

and  impedance of antenna  in  Maxwellian plasma (we assume that presence  of  irregularities  does

not  change  velocity  distribution  function  radically  and  it  may  be  approximately  described  by

Maxwell  distribution).  In  Section  2  the  method  of  calculation  of  effective  dielectric  permittivity

tensor  is  stated.  Section  3  discusses  specific  for  given  problem  difficulties  in  numerical

calculations. Results of numerical calculations in application to ionospheric plasma and plasma of

solar wind are collected in Section 4.

1. Quasi-thermal noise spectrum and antenna impedance

Usually the noise voltage spectral density measured at the electric antenna terminals, which

is  immersed  in  a  plasma  may  be  expressed  through  the  spatial  Fourier  transform  of  the  current

distribution  in  the  antenna  and  autocorrelation  function  of  electrostatic  field  fluctuations  in  the

antenna frame [Rostoker, 1961]. The shot noise, drift of the plasma across the antenna as well as

some other phenomena  also contribute  into noise spectra. We do not take these phenomena  into

account now. If the plasma is in the thermal equilibrium at temperature T , what will be assumed in

further consideration, the voltage spectral density may be expressed through antenna impedance by

the formula [Meyer-Vernet and Pershe, 1989]:

where  Bk  is Boltzmann constant,  Z is antenna impedance and  Re  denotes the real part.

Calculation of antenna impedance in general case is rather complex problem. One must take

into account various phenomena such as  the  disturbance  of  trajectories  of  particles,  collection  of

electrons and ions, photoemission and so on. The common approximation  is to take into account

only electron plasma oscillations. In this approximation one has

To calculate impedance one needs to choose the current distribution 

)(kJ 

. The frequently

used  model  of  current  distribution  corresponds  to  wire  dipole  antenna  [Kuhl  1966;  Kuhl  1967;

cylinders,  each  of  length  L   and  radius 

Kellog 1981]. The geometry of wire dipole antenna is shown in Fig. 1. The antenna consists of two
a << .  This  model  may  be  a  good  approximation  for
geometry of real antennas used for space missions. The antenna parameters used in our calculations

L

are in close correspondence with real parameters of  spacecraft antennae used in investigations of

ionosphere or solar wind (Wind and Kosmos-1809 missions).

For wire dipole antenna one can get [Meyer-Vernet and Pershe, 1989; Kuhl, 1966, Kellog,

1981]:

2. Calculation of effective dielectric permittivity tensor

General  scheme  of  calculation  of  effective  dielectric  permittivity  tensor  starts  from  the

Dyson equation for the mean field in random medium (see [Rytov, Kravtsov and Tatarskii, 1978]).

It  may  be  easily  found  that  effective  dielectric  permittivity  tensor  is  proportional  to  the  Fourier

transform of the mass operator [Ryzhov, 1968]. Taking  into account only  initial term  in the  mass

operator series expansion (what corresponds to Born approximation for the mean field) one should

obtain

At  this  point  of  our  consideration  we  should  choose  a  concrete  type  of  the  irregularity

spatial  spectrum 

.  Ionospheric  irregularities  are  described  by  complex  spectrum,  which

properties are different for different intervals of wave numbers of irregularities, but for the certain

interval of wave numbers the spectrum may be described by power law:

.

)

Generally  the  spectrum  is  anisotropic:  irregularities  may  be  strongly  stretched  along  the

lines of force of geomagnetic  field due to difference  in the diffusion coefficients  for longitudinal

and  transversal  directions.  However,  for  simplicity  of  calculations,  we  will  use  the  model  of

isotropic spectrum. This situation is less characteristic of topside  ionospheric plasma, but  may  be

considered normal for solar wind plasma.

In  isotropic  medium  with  isotropic  irregularities  tensor of  effective  dielectric  permittivity

has  the  same  structure  as  tensor  in  regular  media  (5)  (in  other  words  effective  medium  is  also

isotropic):

Though one could use result (11) directly, without substitution of analytic expressions  for

the inner integral, generally such approach may be not successful. The reason is that integrands in

(11) have several peculiarities, which will be discussed below, as well as significant dependence of

integrand  on  such  parameters  as  Debye's  radius,  outer  scale  of  the  irregularity  spectrum,

dimensions  of  antenna  etc.  The  latter  difficulty,  however,  may  be  considerably  reduced  by

introduction of dimensionless variables.

3. Details of numerical calculations

Considerable difficulties under numerical calculation of quasi-thermal  noise spectrum and

of effective dielectric permittivity tensor using expressions (3) and (11) correspondingly are caused

by  the  "bad"  behavior  of    integrand  at  some  special  points.  In  both  cases  integrand  contains

expressions of one of the following kinds:

words,  in  this  case  the  calculated  noise  spectra  would  contain  random  error  component  due  to

accumulation  of  inaccuracy  under  numerical  integration.  However  the  splitting  of  integration

interval is not sufficient for successful integration. Additional difficulties are caused by the fact that

  in  the  root  may  be  several  orders  of  magnitude  smaller.  To  avoid  this

||

interference  one  should  take  into  account  the  fact  that  in  real  plasma  some  small  collisional

attenuation  is always present. The  value  of  collision  frequency  may  be  chosen  so  that  inequality

As it has been noticed above it is useful to introduce dimensionless variables to reduce the

dependence  of  numerical  calculations  on  certain  values  of  plasma  parameters.  It  is  natural  to
~
determine dimensionless frequency  w~  and wave  number  k

4. Results of numerical calculations

9

For calculations of quasi-thermal  noise spectrum  we  first  chose the  regular  parameters  of

plasma and spectrum of irregularities corresponding to the ionosphere F-region: plasma frequency

2p

 was equal to 3 MHz, Debye's length – 5 cm;  R  = 1 km,  l  = 

p2/10

 km. Calculations were

carried out for four different values of  R
typical  for  undisturbed  mid-latitude  ionosphere,  the  last  is  observed  in  polar  and  equatorial

. The first value is

ionosphere and in the experiments of plasma heating by the powerful HF radio wave.

In regular plasma the spectrum has a peak just above the plasma frequency; the shift from

the  plasma  frequency  is  of  order  of 

~

[Meyer-Vernet  and  Pershe,  1989].  For  the

(
LrD

)2
1<<a

chosen  parameters  of  antenna 

1<<LrD

and 

rD

.It  means  that  noise  spectrum  does  not

depend  upon  the  radius  of  antenna  wire  and  have  a  sharp  peak  near  the  plasma  frequency.  The

spectra for regular plasma and for irregular plasma with given  R

 are plotted in Fig. 6.

In presence of irregularities we observe noticeable change in the spectrum of quasi-thermal

noise.  The  peak  of  the  spectrum  in  this  case  is  split  into two  peaks. The  splitting  of  the  peak  is

caused  by  the  complication  of  dielectric  properties  of  plasma  in  the  presence  of  random
irregularities. At the relatively high magnitudes of   Rd
constant  has  additional  roots,  while  the  contribution  of  the  roots  existing  in  regular  plasma  is

 real part of effective longitudinal dielectric

dumped due to increase of the imaginary part caused by scattering. The distance between peaks is

greater  for  greater  irregularity  level.  Its  magnitude  is  small,  approximately  10  –  15  KHz  for

(cid:215)=

3105

R

  and  ~  100  KHz  for 

(cid:215)=

2103

R

.  Such  details  of  the  spectrum,  however,  can  be

detected in experiment.

For  the  solar  wind  plasma  we  chose  the  following  parameters:  plasma  frequency

Conclusions

10

In this paper we have considered the influence of random irregularities of electron density

in isotropic plasma on the quasi-thermal noise spectrum using fairly simple model of irregularities.

We  have  found  that  for  the  small  values  of  irregularity  level  modification  of  noise  spectrum  is

negligibly small. However, for larger values of 

NN /

, also quite possible  in  natural conditions,

irregularities cause some noticeable effects. In the ionospheric plasma it is the splitting of the peak

in the frequency noise spectrum located just above the plasma frequency, into two peaks. Though

the gap between those peaks is small it still may be detected in experiment. The magnitude of the

gap depends upon the value of 

NN /

, what makes possible using measurements of noise spectra

for the purpose of the irregularity diagnostics. In the solar wind plasma irregularities cause changes

of the shape of the main spectrum maximum near the plasma frequency resulting in appearance of

the plateau under higher irregularity level. This effect also can provide essential information about

the solar wind irregularities.

In  this  paper  we  used  simplified  model  of  plasma  which  may  be  significantly  improved.

The  major  possible  improvement  concerns  the  spectrum  of  irregularities.  For  example,  in  real

topside  ionosphere  irregularities  are  stretched  along  the  lines  of  force  of  geomagnetic  field  and

their spectrum is anisotropic. One can also take into account drift of the plasma across the antenna,

because noise spectra measurement are done on the board of satellite moving through the plasma.

Though  the  account  for  magnetic  field  is  considered  to  be  unimportant  for  calculation  of  noise

spectrum in regular plasma, in the presence of irregularities its influence on wave propagation may

be important.

For  other  kinds  of  space  plasma,  like  the  plasma  of  solar  wind,  the  account  of  all  these

factors may be essential, first of all because such plasma may be anisotropic even in the absence of

external  magnetic  field.  Besides  generally  it  cannot  be  considered  as  being  in  the  thermal

equilibrium, so more general approach to deriving expressions for noise spectra may be required.

ABSTRACT 

 
Spatial effects of interference and interaction of light modes in the subwavelength part of the 
near-field  optical  microscopy  probe  have  been  theoretically  studied.  It  was  found  that  the  mode 
interference  can  lead  to  higher  spatial  compression  of  light  (λ  =  500  nm  in  free  space)  within  the 
transverse  size  of  25  nm  inside  the  probe  output  aperture  of  100  nm  in  diameter.  The  results 
principally  demonstrate  the  possibility  of  increasing  spatial  resolution  of  the  near-field  optical 
microscopy technique.  

Keywords: near-field optics, light interference effects, ultrahigh spatial compression of light.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

 

The near-field optical (NFO-) microscopy technique attracts a great attention in experimental 

investigations of the physical properties of material surfaces [1, 2, 3]. In a most well-known variant 

of NFO-microscopy technique the light propagates through the optical fiber to the probe with taper 

tip  coated  with  metal.  Diameter  of  the  probe  output  aperture  is  significantly  smaller  than  the 
wavelength λ, therefore, the light may be localized on the material surface within the area S << λ2. 

The narrowing part of the NFO-microscopy probe has transverse sizes much smaller than the cut-off 

radius of the majority modes [3] propagating in such optical fiber, thus only a small part of the light 

energy gets into the probe output aperture. The low energy throughput is the main factor limiting the 

spatial  resolution  of  the  technique  and  worsening  the  polarization  characteristics  of  the  output 

radiation. At present it is well known that presence of the evanescent field enables such spatial light 

localization  in  the  probe.  Experimental  measurements  of  the  output  far-field  parameters  [4,  5,  6] 

show  that  the  evanescent  light  acquires  unusual  spatial  characteristics  in  the  probe  aperture  [3]. 

However, it is also well-known that the field scattering diagram has a spread diffuse character at the 

output  aperture.  Experimental  investigations  of  the  spatial  structure  of  light  are  considerably 

restricted  in  the  near-field  zone  of  the  subwavelength  probe  aperture.  In  addition  we  note  that  the 

influence  of  the  spatial  shape  and  physical  parameters  of  the  probe  on  the  propagation  and  spatial 

structure of the light in the probe output aperture have still been insufficiently studied in spite of the 

theoretical  works  [7,  8,  9,  10,  11,  12].  Therefore,  clear  physical  understanding  of  the  spatial 

properties  of  the  compressed  light  in  the  probe  is  still  absent  which  significantly  restricts 

development of the (NFO-) microscopy methods. In this paper we theoretically study the interaction 

and interference effects of the light modes in the subwavelength probe. In the first part of the paper 

an analytical method is developed on the basis of the B.Z.Katzenellenbaum’s cross-sections theory 

[13]. Using the developed theoretical approach we make a numerical analysis of the influence of the 

light interference effects on the spatial structure of the light in the probes with different geometry. 

Our results demonstrate that the light interference effects may play an important role in an sharper 

spatial compression of the light inside the subwavelength probe aperture. 

2. BASIC EQUATION OF THE CROSS-SECTION METHOD 

The B.Z. Katzenellenbaum’s method [13] enables one to study light propagation in the probe 

taking into account its real spatial and physical properties [14,  15]. In this method the light field in 

the arbitrary coordinate z of the narrowing probe is represented through the superposition of the light 

waves propagating in both (z, -z) directions:

 correspond  to  the  j-th  mode  of  the  auxiliary 

comparison waveguide, which has the same spatial distribution in the probe cross-section at the point 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   (1) 

The total fields E(z) and H(z) satisfy the same boundary conditions in a certain surrounding 
of  the  tilted  wall  as  the  field  modes  Еj  and  Нj  on  the  comparison  waveguide  wall  [13].  The  mode

Unlike regular waveguide, our calculations have shown that the rapid change of the boundary 

conditions in the NFO-probe causes effective energy redistribution of the light into several coupled 

light field modes, which interference results in the spatial compression of the light. The system of 

equations (2) describes the interaction between the forward spatial modes and the backward modes, 

which are reflected from the narrowing walls of the probe. Each light mode interacts with all forward 

and backward modes of the HE- or EH- types as well as each mode is absorbed in the probe walls. 

Description of the field modes evolution according to Eqs. (2) in the probe requires calculation of the 

values  Sjm  and  hj  taking  into  account  real  physical  parameters.  We  can  calculate  the  coupling 

coefficient  Sjm  using  the  fact  that  the  magnetic  part  of  the  electric  modes  has  the  second  order  on 

wall wave resistance ξ (

εμ=ξ

 <<1) in the Taylor’s decomposition on ξn [13, 17]. Similarly, the 

electric field component of the magnetic modes represents the second order magnitude on the wall 

wave resistance ξ.  

Therefore in order to find the expression for the coupling coefficient in the first order of ξ it is 

possible to use the modes of the ideal waveguide [16] and calculate the wavenumber of the modes in 

the first order of ξ. Thereby the coupling coefficients of the field modes can be found using solutions 

for the wavenumbers of the waveguide modes with the wall made of  non-ideal metal. In a general 

case  the  wavenumbers  are  the  roots  of  the  complex  transcendental  equation  obtained  from  the 

boundary conditions for the field modes on the metallic wall of the regular waveguide. The equation 

was solved numerically in [19]. We use Leontovich boundary condition [18] in order to determine 

the mode wavenumbers hj in the waveguide with non-ideal walls [13]. In the cylindrical coordinate 

system the condition has the following form of the series up to the first-order of ξ:

The obtained analytical solutions (6), (7) are demonstrated on the Fig.1 and Fig.2, which with 

high accuracy coincide with the earlier numerical results of the work [19]. The solutions (6) and (7) 

allow  us  to  significantly  facilitate  the  numerical  analysis  of  the  field  evolution  in  the  near-field 

microscopy probe, studied below for a number of specific probe forms. 

 

3.SPATIAL INTERFERENCE OF LIGHT MODES IN THE PROBE 

 

The  total  field  energy  decreases  when  the  field  propagates  through  the  probe  towards  the 

output aperture. According to the Eq. (1) the field intensity in the arbitrary point with the coordinate 

z, r⊥ is given by the expression:

Below we study the situation where the main mode Pj=δj,01 is excited at the probe entrance.  

The  excited  main  mode  has  the  least  decay  in  the  fiber  among  the  modes  propagating  in  the 

probe. In accordance with the calculation given below, the field propagation ( λ = 500 nm. in free 

space) starts to decrease rapidly after the probe cross-section radius reaches the critical value for the 

main  mode

, thus the interaction between the 

nearest modes plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the field propagation in the near-field optical 

probe. Particularly strong influence on the field mode propagation occurs in the small output domain 

of the probe where the mode wavenumbers become complex values and the most significant decay 

occurs for the modes. At the same time as it follows from the analysis of the equations system (2), 

the  energy  exchange  between  the  field  modes  exceeds  the  decay  of  each  mode  in  the  probe. 

Therefore it is reasonable to estimate the possibility of efficient generation of the nearby light modes 

at the field propagation in the probe and analyze the appearance of the multimode light structure in 

the probe output.  

It is well-known that the light throughput increases, as the inclination of the probe wall does [3, 

20,  21,  22].  Herewith  in  our  opinion  the  probe  shape variation  should  have a  great  impact  on  the 

field mode structure in the probe. Below in the Fig.3 we demonstrate the numerical calculation of the 

power

 of the excited TM0m modes for the different inclination of the probe 

wall.  The  calculations  have  shown  that  the  main  light  energy  is  carried  in  the  probe  by  the  three 

lowest field modes due to the small values of the coupling coefficients S1j S2j S3j (j>3) comparing to 

the coefficients S12 , S13 and S23. Increasing the probe wall inclination is accompanied by the growth 

of the coupling coefficients that causes a considerable equalization of the energy between the three 

main  modes  at  the  probe  output.  The  second  field  mode  becomes  comparable  with  the  first  main 

mode  when  the  angle  value  α  is  close  to  75о  -  76о  as  shown  in  the  Fig.  3.  We  shall  note  that  the 

second  light  mode  is  excited  more  intensively  than  the  third  mode  noticeably  increasing  only  for 
angle  α  larger  than  72о.  Herewith  the  interaction  of  the  third  mode  with  the  second  mode  fails  to 

strongly  influence  upon  the  second  mode  energy.  Under  such  condition,  using  the  results  of  work 

[23] it is possible to show that the influence of the third mode on the spatial structure of light field in 

the probe output is also strongly suppressed by considerable reflection of the mode from the output 

aperture.  Accordingly,  it  is  possible  to  ignore  the  influence  of  the  third  mode  on  the  light  spatial 

structure of the output radiation (in Fig. 3.) for angles less than 80.  

Accomplished calculations of the total energy transferred by all field modes are in accordance 

with available results [3, 20, 21, 22]. Our calculation of the light spatial structure for the TM11 modes 

are in good agreement with experimental data [5, 6] of the measurement of the far-field intensities. 

We have studied the interference peculiarities of the light modes in the probe and its influence upon 

the  light  field  spatial  structure  at  the  probe  output  with  the  output  aperture  diameter

inclination  α<  45o,  when  the  whole  light  energy  is  carried  by  first  main  mode.  In  this  case  the 

distinctive spatial structure of the light at the probe output aperture is shown in the Fig. 4, where the

However, the transverse size of the light field (refer to. the Fig. 5) is still defined by spatial 

structure of the longitudinal component of the main mode with the thickness about d ≈ 80 nm on half

 and 

)(2 LP

,  their  interference  considerably  influences  the  light  field  spatial 

structure. The interference leads to a sharp spatial compression of the light field for the angle α ≈ 

75

o (see Fig. 8).  

The additional consequence of the interference is that the main part of the light field at probe 

the  output  aperture  is  principally  determined  by  longitudinal  field  component,  which  aquires  a 

spatial toric structure with ring thickness d ≈ 25 nm. This ring thickness determines spatial limits of 

the light compression, which can be noticeably narrower than the output probe diameter D=100 nm. 

The spatial thickness of the longitudinal dz(z) and transverse dr(z) components of the field intensities 

on its half height are shown in Fig. 9 and Fig.10. As seen from Fig. 9 appearance of the spatial torus 

is the result of the two light modes interference, which dramatically changes the spatial width dz(z) at 
the  angle  α  ≈  55o.  Therewith  it  seen  from  Fig.  10,  Fig.  4,  Fig.  5  and  Fig.8  that  the  value  of  dr(z) 

decreases  monotonous  while  the  main  energy  of  the  transverse  polarized  field  component  is 

restricted by the probe walls. 

We  note  the  main  intensity  peak  would  be  only  in  the  probe  output  centre  with  the  spatial 

width about 80 nm (for D=100 nm) for other phase relation between the field modes (particularly for 

the  phases

).  This  behaviour  would  be  also  accompanied  by  additional  weaker 

intensity peaks near the aperture boundary. Analytical and numerical analysis of the light properties 

becomes too complicated for the angle α > 85o  due to the reflection effects of the field modes from 

the probe output. We will study these effects elsewhere later.  

 

4. CONCLUSION 

 

In  this  work  the  affects  of  interaction  and  interference  of  the  light  modes  on  the  spatial 

structure of the output field in near-field optical microscopy probe have been studied. The presented 

investigation  have  been  performed  for  the  real  physical  and  spatial  parameters  of  the  probe  with 

diameter  of  the  output  aperture  D=100  nm,  which  is  noticeably  smaller  than  the  light  wavelength 

λ=500 nm. The investigation has shown that the change of the probe shape (increasing of the wall 

inclination α near the probe output aperture) considerably enhances the interaction and interference 

of the spatial light modes in the narrowing part of the probe, which in turn dramatically changes the 

spatial  structure  of  the  light  field.  Such  effects  already  reveal  itself  via  the  presence  of  two  mode 

structure  of  the  light  field  at  the  wall  inclinations  α  >  45о.  The  two  mode  interference  effects  are 

especially amplified for the angels 65о < α< 80о leading to the narrow spatial toric structure in the 

field intensity on the probe output. The toric structure demonstrates a stronger spatial compression of 

the  light  for  the  angle  α=  75о  where  the  toric  wall  has  minimum  thickness  close  to  25  nm.  Such 

spatially compressed light contains areas with primarily longitudinal or transverse polarization. We 

note  that  spatial  compression  of  the  field  from  the  diameter  D1=100  nm  up  to  D2=25  nm  will 

decrease the light throughput to

 times [3, 7] if we use a usual direct reduction of 

the probe output aperture.  

Modern experimental methods offer good opportunities to control distance δz with accuracy of 

nanometers  between  the  medium  surface  and  the  plane  of  the  output  probe  aperture  [1].  For 

sufficiently  small  distances  δz<<λ,  the  light  field  on  the  surface  will  coincide  practically  with  the 

light  field  at  the  output  probe  aperture.  Thus  by  choosing  the  proposed  near  field  probe  with  the 

inclination α ≈ 76o one can considerably enhance the spatial resolution in the experiments with small 

objects  (like  single  molecules  and  other  nanoparticles)  where  the  resolution  will  be  determined  by 

the  narrow  peaks  of  the  field  intensities  dz(α).  The  predicted  ultrahigh  “interference”  spatial 

compression of the light field offers a new attractive possibility for the experimental investigation of 

solid  states  surfaces  with  nanometer  resolution.  Detailed  study  of  these  problems  represents  an 

interesting subject for further investigations.

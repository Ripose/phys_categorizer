Abstract

The picosecond dynamics of hydroxyl radicals generated in 200 nm photoinduced

dissociation of aqueous hydrogen peroxide have been observed through their transient

absorbance at 266 nm. It is shown that these kinetics are nearly exponential, with a decay

time of ca. 30 ps. The prompt quantum yield for the decomposition of H2O2 is 0.56, and

the fraction of hydroxyl radicals escaping from the solvent cage to the water bulk is 64-

68%.  These  recombination  kinetics  suggest  strong  caging  of  the  geminate  hydroxyl

radicals by water. Phenomenologically, these kinetics may be rationalized in terms of the

diffusion of hydroxide radicals out of a shallow potential well (a solvent cage) with an

Onsager radius of 0.24 nm.

UV-light induced photodissociation of aqueous hydrogen peroxide

is widely used in water treatment, medical equipment sterilization, bleaching, etc. [1,2]

These practical uses are facilitated by the high oxidation potential of the photogenerated

hydroxyl radicals and large primary quantum yield of H2O2 decomposition, 0.4-0.5 [3,4].

The overall quantum yield is further increased to 1-2, due to Haber-Weiss chain reactions

that proceeds with a rate constant k4=4.7x109 M-1 s-1 at 25oC [5].

While the general photochemistry of H2O2 decomposition is well understood, no

mechanistic insight yet exists as to the dynamics of geminate (HO..OH) pairs generated

in photoreaction (1). In this Letter, the dynamics of these hydroxyl radicals using 200 nm

pump - 266 nm probe ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy are reported. We also

report an improved measurement for the primary quantum yield of free hydroxyl radicals

in 248 nm photodissociation of H2O2.

2. Experimental

Picosecond  pump-probe  kinetics.  The  ultrafast  kinetic  measurements  reported  below

were carried out using a 1 kHz Ti:sapphire setup. A diode-pumped Nd:YVO laser was

used  to  pump  Kerr  lens  mode-locked  Ti:sapphire  laser  operating  at  80  MHz  (Spectra

2

Physics Tsunami). The 45 fs FWHM pulses from the oscillator where stretched to 80 ps

in a single grating stretcher, and single pulses were then selected at 1 KHz with a Pockels

cell.  The  2  nJ  pulses  were  amplified  to  4  mJ  in  a  two-stage  multipass  Ti:sapphire

amplifier and passed through a grating compressor that yielded Gaussian probe pulses of

60 fs FWHM and 3 mJ centered at 800 nm. The amplified beam was split into three parts.

The first 800 nm beam was used to generate 200 nm (fourth harmonic) pulses used as a

pump,  as  explained  below:  it  was  passed  through  two  tandem  BBO  crystals  that
generated the second (Type I, 500 µm, 29o) and third (Type II, 100 µm, 58o) harmonic.

The fourth harmonic is produced by upconversion of the third harmonic (266 nm) and the
second 800 nm beam in a third BBO crystal (Type I, 100 µm, 68o). Up to 20 µJ of the

200 nm light was produced this way (300 fs FWHM pulse). The pump power, before and

after the sample, was determined using a calibrated power meter (Ophir Optronics model
2A-SH). The 266 nm probe was produced by third harmonic generation with two 200 µm

thick BBO crystals using the third 800 nm beam. To remove the 1st and 2nd harmonics,

the resulting beam was passed through a 3 nm FWHM notch filter and then reflected, in

succession, from four 266 nm dielectric mirrors placed in each arm of the spectrometer.

Test experiments showed that no residual signal from the lower harmonics reached the

photodiode detectors.

The  pump  and  probe  beams  were  perpendicularly  polarized,  focused  to  round

spots of 100 µm and 20 µm radius, respectively, and overlapped in the sample at 6.5
.
The spot sizes were determined by scanning the beam with a 10 µm pinhole. The signal

o

and  the  reference  probe  pulses  (<  1  nJ)  were  detected  with  fast  silicon  photodiodes,

amplified, and sampled using home-built sample-and-hold electronics and a 16 bit A/D

converter. A mechanical chopper locked at half the repetition rate of the laser was used to

block the pump pulses on alternative shots. No dependence of the transient absorbance on

the pump and probe polarization was found.

Aqueous  H2O2  solution  was  prepared  by  mixing  35  wt%  hydrogen  peroxide

(Aldrich; stabilized with a trace of tin) with deaerated nanopure water. The solution was
constantly purged with dry nitrogen. The experiments were carried out using a 150 µm

thick,  6  mm  wide  high-speed  (10  m/s)  jet  with  a  stainless  steel  nozzle.  An  all  316

3

stainless steel and Teflon flow system was used to pump the solution through this jet at
0.5-0.75 dm3/min.

Importantly, two photon photoionization of the solvent (water) is negligible under

the conditions of our experiment because the two-photon absorbance of 200 nm light by

water  is  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  one-photon  absorbance  by  1  M  H2O2  (OD200

across  the  jet  is  ca.  3).  Even  without  1  M  H2O2  in  the  solution,  the  266  nm  transient

absorption signal from the hydroxyl radical and hydrated electron generated in the course

of  the  photoionization  was  <  1  %  of  the  signal  from  the  hydrogen  peroxide  solution,

under identical irradiation conditions.

Nanosecond  kinetics.  Fifteen  nanosecond  fwhm,  1-20  mJ  pulse  from  an  KrF  excimer

laser (Lamda Physik LPX 120i) was used to photolyze N2-saturated aqueous solutions

containing 20-40 mM of H2O2 and 1 M NaHCO3. The absorbance of the 248 nm light by
the bicarbonate was negligible (< 0.021 M-1 cm-1). 0.2 L of the solution was circulated

through the cell using a peristaltic pump. The 1.36 mm optical path cell had 1 mm thick

suprasil windows. The laser beam was masked with a 3 mm x 6 mm rectangular brass

aperture. This beam was normal to the windows; the analyzing light (> 500 nm) from a
superpulsed  Xe  lamp  was  crossed  at  30o  with  this  248  nm  excitation  beam.  The

wavelength of the analyzing light (600 nm) was selected using a 10 nm fwhm narrow

band interference filter.

A fast silicon photodiode (EG&G model FND100Q, biased at -90 V) with a 1.2

GHz video amplifier (Comlinear model CLC100) terminated into a digital signal analyzer

(Tektronix model DSA601) were used to sample the transient absorbance kinetics (3 ns

response time). Two calibrated energy meters (Molectron model J25-080) were used to

measure the power of the incident and transmitted 248 nm light.

3. Results and Discussion.

200  nm  pump-probe  kinetics.  Fig.  1  shows  transient  absorption  kinetics  of  hydroxyl

radicals observed at 266 nm in 200 nm photolysis of 1 M H2O2. The short-lived "spike"

observed within the duration of 200 nm light pulse is due to simultaneous absorption of

4

both  the  pump  and  probe  pulses  (i.  e.,  "1+1"  nonlinear  absorbance)  and  gives  the

instrument  response  function;  this  "spike"  is  a  common  artifact  in  UV  pump-probe

studies [6].

As seen from Fig. 1, the kinetics observed after the excitation pulse are nearly

exponential. The hydroxyl radicals rapidly escape from the solvent cage into the water

bulk (with a time constant of 29 ps); from the exponential fit, the escape fraction of these

radicals is ca. 68%. To estimate the quantum yield of photoreaction (1), the following

approach was used: The radial profiles for the pump and probe beams were assumed to

be Gaussian, so that incident (time-integrated) photon fluence for the pump beam was

given by

Thus, to obtain φ  using eq. (10), the sample thickness L and the absorption coefficient β

of  the  sample  at  the  excitation  wavelength  need  not  be  known;  it  is  sufficient  to

determine the optical density for the probe light and the pump power before and after the

sample. Note that the prompt quantum yield for the decomposition of H2O2 is 1/2 of the

quantum yield of hydroxyl radicals.

For the kinetic trace shown in Fig. 1, Ipump=3 µJ, rpump= 100 µm and rprobe=20 µm.
The molar extinction coefficients εprobe for hydroxyl radicals at 266 nm are not known
accurately: the estimates vary by as much as 25%, from 370 to 465 M-1 cm-1 [7-12]. Since

these  coefficients  were  determined  in  pulse  radiolysis  experiments,  these  coefficients

depend on the estimates for the radiolytic yields; the latter have been revised repeatedly

after  the  original  experiments  were  carried  out  [5-13].  Perhaps,  the  most  reliable
measurement  is  by  Nielsen  et  al.  [8],  εprobe  =420  M-1  cm-1.  Using  this  estimate,  the

average  concentration  of  the  hydroxyl  radicals  across  the  jet  was  0.8  mM  and  the

quantum  yield  of  peroxide  decomposition  at  0  and  500  ps  was  0.56  and  0.38,
respectively. At 200 nm, hydrogen peroxide has an extinction coefficient of 200 M-1 cm-1
[8] and the pump light was absorbed in 22 µm (i.e., all of the 200 nm light was absorbed

by the jet), so that the concentration of radicals near the jet surface was 5.6 mM. While

6

this  concentration  is  relatively  high,  given  the  rate  of  reaction  (4)  the  lifetime  of  free

hydroxyl radical was 40 ns, i.e., no cross recombination occurred within the observation
window  (500  ps).  Reaction  (2)  is  also  too  slow  (k2=2.9x107  M-1 s-1  [5])  to  affect  the

geminate dynamics of hydroxyl radicals in 1 M hydrogen peroxide.

Our estimate of 0.38 for the primary quantum yield for decomposition of H2O2

(after the escape of hydroxide radicals to the bulk) compares favorably with the estimates

given in the literature: 0.49±0.07 [3] and 0.47±0.03 [4] at 254 nm and 0.45±0.06 at 222

nm [2] (also, see below). This estimate can be brought into a better agreement with these

previous measurements by reconsideration of the extinction coefficient for the hydroxyl

radical. The radiolytic measurements of Nielsen et al. [8] and Czapski and Bielski [9]

relied on the yield of 5.3 hydroxyl radicals per 100 eV of radiation absorbed by N2O-

saturated water, whereas other work suggests a 15% higher yield (6.1 per 100 eV) [13].
This readjustment decreases the molar absorptivity to 400 M-1 cm-1 (which also compares
better to 370 M-1 cm-1 obtained in the photolytic experiments of Boyle et al [10]) and

increases our estimate of the quantum yield from 0.38 to 0.44 - in agreement with the

previous work [2,3,4] and the estimates given below (in such a case, the prompt quantum

yield of 0.56 should be increased to 0.65).

Quantum yield for 248 nm photolysis. All of the previous estimates for the quantum yield

of H2O2 decomposition were obtained by product analysis (evolution of gaseous oxygen)

at the end of chain reactions (1) to (4). To improve on these indirect estimates for the

yield of reaction (1), we used 248 nm laser flash photolysis to observe the primary yield
of free hydroxyl radicals through their fast reaction with bicarbonate anions (k11= 1.5x107
M-1 s-1 [14] or 8.5x106 M-1 s-1 [15] )

At  the  p H =8.3  (1  M  bicarbonate),  all  hydrogen  peroxide  (pKa=11.7  [5])  is  in  the

protonated form. The formation of the carbonate radical anion was observed at 600 nm
(ε600(CO3
-)=1860 M-1 cm-1 [14]); this formation was complete in 200 ns (the apparent rate
constant for reaction (11) was 2x107  M-1 s-1). The second-order decay of the carbonate
radical anion (2k=1.25x107 M-1 s-1 [16]) was slow, with t1/2 of 5-10 µs, so the loss of the

7

- with
600 nm signal due to the cross recombination was negligible. The reaction of CO3
H2O2 is also very slow (k=8x105 M-1 s-1 [16]). The highest yield of the hydroxyl radicals
estimated from our kinetic data was 140 µM; at this concentration, all of the reactions

competing  with  reaction  (11)  (such  as  rxn.  (2)  and  (4))  are  too  slow  to  change  the
- radical anions at t=200 ns. Note that 2 µM hydroxide and 9.9 mM

observed yield of CO3

carbonate are present in the solution due to the protic equilibria of the carbonate system.
The  hydroxide  anion  rapidly  reacts  with  the  hydroxyl  radical  yielding  O-  [5],  but  the

concentration of the hydroxide is too low to affect our measurement. While the carbonate
anion also reacts with the hydroxyl radical with rate constant of 4.2x108 M-1 s-1 [14], the
-, i.e., no loss of the 600 nm absorbance from the carbonate

product of this reaction is CO3

radical anion ensues.

The transient absorbance at 600 nm (at t=200 ns) was plotted vs. the number of
the absorbed  photons. The initial slope  of  this  curve  (for 248  nm laser  fluence < 1016
photons/cm2) corresponds to a quantum yield of 0.44±0.01, in reasonable agreement with
the previous measurements. At higher 248 nm laser fluence ( (2-to-6)x1016 photons/cm2),
the ∆OD600 plot exhibited a negative curvature (for example, the apparent quantum yield
decreases  to  0.384  for  the  fluence  of  4x1016 photons/cm2).  This  negative  curvature  is

accounted  for  by  the  absorption  of  the  248  nm  light  by  hydroxyl  radicals  that  are
generated within the duration of the laser pulse (ε248(HO)=500 M-1 cm-1 [9]). The molar

absorptivity of H2O2  at  248  nm  is  very  low  compared  to  that  of  the  hydroxyl  radicals
formed  in  reaction  (1)  (we  obtained  ε248(H2O2)=26  M-1  cm-1  using  an  Olis/Cary-14
spectrophotometer and 24.8 M-1 cm-1 from the KrF laser transmission data), i.e., under

the conditions of our experiment up to 20-40% of the 248 nm photons are absorbed by

these radicals. Numerical simulations indicate that this effect fully accounts both for the
negative  curvature  of  the  ∆OD600  plot  and  the  observed  linear  decrease  in  the

transmission of the 248 nm light with the laser power. Note that this effect is minor in our

picosecond experiment because the concentration of hydrogen peroxide ( 1 M vs. 20-40
mM) and its extinction coefficient at 200 nm (200 M-1 cm-1  vs.  26  M-1 cm-1) are both

considerably higher. Thus, < 0.5 % of the 200 nm light was absorbed by the hydroxyl

radicals, which justifies the use of eq. (10).

Kinetic analysis.

The most intriguing of our observations is that the recombination

kinetics of hydroxyl radicals are nearly exponential, whereas a very different dependence

was  expected  for  the  geminate  recombination  controlled  by  free  diffusion  of  these

radicals.  This  suggests  a  weak  interaction  between  the  radicals  (in  other  words,  the

existence  of  a  solvent  cage  around  the  radical  partners).  Phenomenologically,  this

interaction can be described in terms of a mean force potential U(r) having a profile of a

well [17,18]. As shown by Shushin [17], the decay kinetics of diffusional escape from

such a potential well exhibits two regimes: (i) an exponential decay on a short time scale

(with rate constant W=Wr+Wd, where Wr,d are the recombination and dissociation rates of
the radicals in the potential well, respectively), and t-1/2 behavior on the longer time scale,

due to slow recombination of radicals that escaped beyond the Onsager radius a, at which

U(a)=-kT. In this theory, the escape probability pd of the radical partners is equal to Wr/W

and the effective radius Reff of the reaction in the bulk is given by a product a(1-pd) [18].

Fig. 1 demonstrates the fit of the experimental kinetics to Shushin’s theory expressions

[17,18] for the survival probability of a radical pair migrating out of the potential well.
Using a diffusion coefficient of 2.8x10-5 cm2/s for the hydroxyl radical [5], one obtains
the parameters pd=0.64, a=0.24 nm, and W-1=20.6 ps, which in turn yield Reff=0.09 nm. A

direct  estimate  from  the  known  rate  constant  of  reaction  (4)  in  the  bulk  [5]  gives  the

recombination radius of 0.11 nm.

4. Conclusion.

Photoexcitation  of  hydrogen  peroxide  at  200  nm  causes  its  rapid  (<  300  fs)

dissociation with the formation of weakly interacting geminate hydroxyl radicals in the
solvent cage. At 25oC, the decay of these radicals from the cage takes ca. 20 ps, with 64%

of the radicals escaping to the water bulk and the rest recombining. The prompt quantum

yield  for  the  photodissociation  of  H2O2  is  0.56  (or  0.65,  depending  on  the  assumed

estimate  for  the  molar  absorptivity  of  hydroxyl  radical;  see  above),  and  the  Onsager

radius of the attractive potential is 0.24 nm. The absolute primary quantum yield for H2O2

decomposition (to free hydroxyl radicals) for 248 nm photoexcitation is 0.44.

Abstract—A  Time  to  Digital  Converter  was  designed  (CMOS 
0.35  µm)  in  order  to  be  used  in  Liquid  Xenon  PET  prototype. 
The circuit proved to be able to work at -120°C, while showing a 
resolution of 250 ps. The circuit enables a low readout dead time 
(<90  ns)  and  provides  a  fully  synchronous  digital  interface  for 
easy data retrieval.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

P

ositron  Emission  Tomography 
(PET)  can  perform 
functional  imaging  of  biological  systems  at  molecular 
level.  This  technique  consists  in  detecting  2  gamma  photons 
emitted in opposite directions and in coincidence (<1 ns). 
 

Since 2001 a R&D project has been initiated on the use of 
Liquid  Xenon  (LXe)  for  small  animal  tomography  [1].  The 
advantage of this scintillator is to have a high light efficiency, 
and also, since it is liquid, the possibility to shape the detector 
at  will.  The  shape  of  a  module  Fig.  1  is  under  study.  On  the 
contrary of crystal detector, modules can be distributed axially 
of the Field Of View. 

 
When a gamma particle hits the Xenon, light is emitted on 
all  direction  and  the  photomultiplier  tube  or  Avalanche 
Photodiode (also working at the temperature of LXe) converts 
it in an electrical signal. For allowing an image reconstruction, 
the module must provide the energy, localization and the date 
of the particle interaction; this means that a lot of information 
has  to  cross  the  cryostat.  The  solution  to  that  problem  is  to 
develop  an  integrated  front-end  electronics  close  to  the 
module  at  the  LXe  temperature  and  thus  minimizing  the 
number of wires that crosses this frontier (see Fig. 1).

one Time to Digital Converter (for interaction dating) 
one  FPGA  for  the  serial  link,    ASIC  general

module auto triggering 

 
With  this  architecture,  the  only  wires  going  out  of  the 
cryostat are the power supplies and the twisted pair serial link. 

II.  DESIGN OF THE TDC 

A.  Background 
The aim of this project was not to design a TDC with a high 
resolution  (see  [2]  for  the  different  kinds  of  TDC),  but  a 
functional  one  for  LXe.  This  implies  that  it  must  operate  at 
165 K, with resolution lower than 1 ns, and minimum current 
consumption  (and  therefore  a  self  heating)  kept  to  the 
minimum  and  a  low  dead  time.  All  these  criteria  lead  to  the 
choice of a TDC based on a Delay Locked Loop, Fig. 2.

Fig. 2 DLL overview 
The  TDC  uses  the  128  elementary  cells  in  the  delay  line  in 
order  to  propagate  the  clock  signal  (here  F=32MHz  (cid:1) 
T=31.25 ns). Once a hit pulse is received the state of the delay 
line  is  memorized  and  then  encoded;  after  these  steps,  the 
position of the edge of the clock and the clock cycle number 
are provided on the digital interface, as well as a synchronous 
signal flagging the data. 

In order to keep the same elementary delay over the process 
and temperature variations, the Delay Line has to be regulated, 
and thus becomes a Delay locked Loop. 
 

B.  Delay Locked Loop 
As shown in Fig. 3, the DLL is composed of 128 elementary 

delays, a phase detector, a charge pump and a level shifter. 

 

1)  Elementary delay cell 

This cell comprises 2 inverters whose propagation time is 
voltage controlled by Vcp and Vcn.

During the implementation of this bloc, care was taken not to 
insert a phase offset with a non symmetrical laying out. 

3)  Charge pump and shifter 

The  charge  pump  is  fed  with  the  signals  provided  by  the 
previous block for charging or discharging a capacitor (Fig. 6).

A  particular  attention  was  paid  to  the  clock  duty  cycle 
conservation [4], this is why the cell is highly symmetric.  

2)  Phase detector 
The  purpose  of  this  block  is  to  provide  phase  difference 

information for performing the line regulation.

Fig. 6 charge pump and level shifter 
The  capacitor  generates  the  control  voltages  through  the 
shifter bloc. The shifter bloc is here for the linearization of the 
control  signal  because  the  function  delay=f(Vcp,Vcn)  is 
highly non linear. 
 

C.  Line memorization 

In  order  to  have  a  proper  line  memorization  and  to  avoid  a 
false encoding, a buffer is inserted between the delay line and 
the  memorization  line.  Therefore,  a  sufficient  high  slew  rate 
signal  is  presented  at  the  input  of  the  latch  and  thus  it 
decreases the probability to observe a metastable cell.

Fig. 4 Phase detector 

With  this  kind  of  detector  (Fig.  4),  the  delay  between 
CLKDL and CLK is oscillating around the mean value of the 
delay: one clock period. This leads to the intrinsic jitter of the 
DLL  (Fig.  5).  Other  kinds  of  phase  detector  are  available  but 
they exhibit other drawbacks [5].

The clock tree distributed to the memorization cells has to be

D.  Digital part architecture 

At the input, the trigger signal is gated by a latch which does 
not  allow  a  new  trigger  as  long  as  the  previous  data  has  not 
been treated (Fig. 7).

Also,  the  accepted  trigger  is  resynchronized  through  two 
consecutive  latches  for  generating  a  data  available  flag  and 
thus  providing  an  easy  readout  interface.  The  readout  dead 
time is due to that (Fig. 8).

1)  Position encoding methodology 

For generating an encoded value of the fine delay, two steps 
are needed. At first, the clock rising edge must be localized in 
the memorized delay line, and then having this position (1 bit 
at  one  among  128  bit)  the  corresponding  code  must  be 
provided. 

 

If a close look is taken at the state of an eight elements delay 
line (Fig. 9), we can see that the position number is determined 
by the number of the last bit at 1 before the 1 to 0 change in 
the memorized line state. For instance when hit #1 occurs, the 
only  delay  element  having  its  signal  rising  is  Dly5,  and  the 
corresponding code (01111000) yields bit 5.

Fig. 9 Eight elements delay line timing 
The  digital system that  allows detecting  this edge in a line is 
given  below  Fig.  10  (replicated  128  times),  it  also  provides  a

Fig. 10 Edge detection logic 
Once the edge is located (only one bit at one in the line), the 
position  has  to  be  encoded.  It  can  be  easily  done  with  OR 
gates. Below is given the methodology for an 8 bit line.

One can notice the following: 

-  Bit0 = Pos1 or Pos3 or Pos5 or Pos7 ; 
-  Bit1 = Pos2 or Pos3 or Pos6 or Pos7 ; 
-  Bit2 = Pos4 or Pos5 or Pos6 or Pos7 ; 

This can be easily extended for a 128 bit.

2)  Coarse counting 

Once the Hit has been encoded at a resolution of 250 ps, it 
must still be associated with the proper clock cycle. For doing 
that  we  use  the  architecture  proposed  by  C.  Lujslin  [3]  was 
used, where 2 counters are counting, one on the rising edge of 
the clock and the other one on the falling edge (Fig. 11).

Then,  when  a  hit  occurs,  both  counter  values  are  saved,  and 
the relevant one (stable at the sampling time) is multiplexed to 
the  output.  The  multiplexer  is  controlled  by  the  MSB  of  the 
fine  value.  A  carry  output  is  provided  for  counter  range 
extension. 

III.  CHIP TEST RESULTS 

5 different circuits were tested. 

•  Resolution : 244 ps with a clock at 32MHz 
•  DLL lock range : from 20MHz to 40MHz 
•  Differential  non  linearity:  + /-  20%  (0.2  LSB) 
(excepted  for  channel  126  and  127,  due  to  a  layout 
problem). 
Integral non linearity : <1%

is 

• 
•  Memorized

•  Reproducibility :  For  the  same  delay,  the  5  ASIC 

give the same fine value 

•  Consumption :  14mW  (190  µA  on  the  3V3  analog 

and 3,9mA on the 3V3 digital) 

•  Pulse mid height width : less than 2 channels 
Testing in cryostat showed that the TDC could work a least to 
-120°C. The TDC parameter remained unchanged.

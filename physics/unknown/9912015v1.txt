is  fundamentally  a 

Quantum  mechanics 

theory  concerned  with
knowledge  of  the  physical  world.    It  is  not  fundamentally  concerned  with
describing the functioning of the physical world independent of the observing,
thinking  person,  as  Newtonian  mechanics  is  generally  considered  to  be
(Snyder,  1990,  1992).   Chief among the reasons for  the  thesis  that  cognition
and the physical world are linked in quantum mechanics is that  all  knowledge
concerning  physical  existents  is  developed  using  their  associated  wave
functions,  and  the  wave  functions  provide  only  probabilistic  knowledge
regarding the  physical  world  (Liboff,  1993).    There  is  no  physical  world  in
quantum mechanics that is assumed to function independently  of  the  observer
who  uses  quantum  mechanics  to  develop  predictions  and  who  makes
observations  that  have  consistently  been  found  to  support  these  predictions.
Also  significant  is  the  immediate  change  in  the  quantum  mechanical  wave
function  associated  with  a  physical  existent  that  generally  occurs  throughout
space  upon  measurement  of  the  physical  existent.    This  change  in  the  wave
function is not limited by the velocity limitation of the special theory of relativity
for physical existents- the velocity of light in vacuum.

Another relevant feature of quantum mechanics is the complex  number
nature of the wave function associated with a physical existent that is the basis
for  deriving  whatever  information  can  be  known  concerning  the  existent
(Eisberg  &  Resnick,  1974/1985).    A  complex  function  is  one  that  has  both
mathematically  imaginary  and  real  components.    The  physical  world  is
traditionally described by mathematically real  numbers,  giving  rise  to  Eisberg
and  Resnick’s  (1974/1985)  comment  that  “we  should  not  attempt  to  give  to
wave functions [in quantum mechanics] a physical existence in the same sense
that water waves have a physical existence” (p. 147).

Nonetheless, the particular  demonstration  concerning  the  phenomenon
of interference to be discussed  in  the  next  section  is  remarkable.    Examining
interference will spotlight the wave-particle duality in quantum  mechanics,  the
key feature of this duality being that physical existents sometimes show particle-
like  characteristics  and  sometimes  show  wave-like  characteristics.    Wave
functions  exhibiting  interference  are  based  on  the  sum  of  two  or  more

characterize  some  physical  phenomenon,  this  phenomenon  is  described  by  a
wave function that consists of only one of these elementary wave functions.

Feynman’s Two-Hole Gedankenexperiments

Generally  the  change  in  the  wave  function  that  often  occurs  in
measurement  in  quantum  mechanics  has  been  ascribed  to  the  unavoidable
physical interaction between the  measuring  instrument  and  the  physical  entity
measured.    Indeed,  Bohr  (1935)  maintained  that  this  unavoidable  interaction
was  responsible for the uncertainty principle, more specifically the  inability  to
simultaneously  measure  observable  quantities  described  by  non-commuting
Hermitian  operators  (e.g.,  the  position  and  momentum  of  a  particle).    The
following  series  of  gedankenexperiments  in  this  section  will  show  that  this
interaction is not necessary to effect a change in the wave function.  The series
of gedankenexperiments indicates that knowledge plays a significant role in the
change in the wave function that often occurs in measurement (Snyder,  1996a,
1996b).

Gedankenexperiment 1

Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1965) explained that the distribution of
electrons passing through a wall with two suitably arranged holes to a backstop
where the positions of the electrons are detected exhibits interference (Figure 1).
Electrons at the backstop  may be detected with a Geiger counter or an electron
multiplier.  Feynman et  al.  explained  that  this  interference  is  characteristic  of
wave phenomena and that the distribution of electrons at the backstop indicates
that each of the electrons acts like a wave as it passes through the wall  with two
holes.    It  should  be  noted  that  when  the  electrons  are  detected  in  this
gedankenexperiment,  they  are  detected  as  discrete  entities,  a  characteristic  of
particles, or in Feynman et al.’s terminology, “lumps” (p. 1-5).

In  Figure  1,  the  absence  of  lines  indicating  possible  paths  for  the
electrons to take from the electron source to the backstop  is  not  an  oversight.
An  electron  is  not  taking  one  or  the  other  of  the  paths.    Instead,  the  wave
function associated with each electron  after  it  passes  through  the  holes  is  the
sum of two more elementary wave functions, with each of these wave functions
experiencing  diffraction  at  one  or  the  other  of  the  holes.    Epstein  (1945)
emphasized that when  the  quantum  mechanical  wave  of  some  physical  entity
such as an electron exhibits interference, it is interference generated only in the
wave function characterizing the individual entity.

Negative Observations

The  diffraction  patterns  resulting  from  the  waves  of  the  electrons
passing through the two holes would at different spatial points along a backstop
behind the hole exhibit constructive or destructive interference.  At some points
along  the  backstop,  the  waves  from  each  hole  sum  (i.e.,  constructively
interfere), and  at  other  points  along  the  backstop,  the  waves  from  each  hole
subtract  (i.e.,  destructively  interfere).    The  distribution  of  electrons  at  the
backstop is given  by  the  absolute  square  of  the  combined  waves  at  different
locations  along  the  backstop,  similar  to  the  characteristic  of  a  classical  wave
whose  intensity  at  a  particular  location  is  proportional  to  the  square  of  its
amplitude.  Because the electrons are detected as discrete entities, like particles,
at  the  backstop,  it  takes  many  electrons  to  determine  the  intensity  of  the
quantum wave that describes each of the  electrons  and  that  is  reflected  in  the
distribution of the electrons against the backstop.

Gedankenexperiment 2

Feynman  et  al.  further  explained  that  if  one  were  to  implement  a
procedure  in  which  it  could  be  determined  through  which  hole  the  electron
passed, the interference pattern is destroyed and the resulting distribution of the
electrons resembles that of classical particles passing through the two holes  in
an important way.   Feynman et al.  relied  on  a  strong  light  source  behind  the
wall and between the two holes that illuminates an electron as it travels through
either hole (Figure 2).   Note the significant difference between the distribution
patterns in Figures 1 and 2.

In Figure 2,  the  path  from  the  electron’s  detection  by  the  light  to  the
backstop is indicated, but it is important to emphasize that this path is inferred
only after the electron has reached the backstop.  A measurement of the position
of the electron with the use of the light source introduces an uncertainty  in  its
momentum.  Only when the electron is detected at the backstop can one infer the
path the electron traveled from the hole it went through to the backstop.  It is not
something one can know before the electron strikes the backstop.

In  Feynman  et  al.’s  gedankenexperiment  using  the  light  source,  the
distribution of  electrons  passing  through  both  holes  would  be  similar  to  that
found  if  classical  particles  were  sent  through  an  analogous  experimental
arrangement  in  an  important  way.    Specifically,  as  in  the  case  of  classical
particles, this distribution of electrons at the backstop is the simple summation
of the distribution patterns for electrons passing through one or  the other of the
holes.  Figure 3 shows the distribution  patterns of electrons  passing through

distribution patterns are identical to those that would  occur  if  only  one  or  the
other of the holes were open at  a  particular  time.    An  inspection  of  Figure  3
shows that summing the distribution patterns for the electrons passing through
hole A and those passing through hole B results  in  the  overall  distribution  of
electrons found in Gedankenexperiment 2.

The Uncertainty Principle

that 

they 

illustrate  certain  apparently 

Feynman et al.’s  gedankenexperiments are  themselves  very  interesting
in 
incongruent  characteristics  of
microscopic  physical  existents,  namely  particle-like  and  wave-like  features.
Feynman et al.  discussed their gedankenexperiments in terms of  Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle.  Feynman et al. wrote:

He [Heisenberg] proposed as a general principle, his  uncertainty
principle,  which  we  can  state  in  terms  of  our  experiment  as
follows:  “It  is  impossible  to  design  an  apparatus  to  determine
which hole the electron passes through, that will not at the same
time  disturb  the  electrons  enough  to  destroy  the  interference
pattern.”  If an apparatus is capable of  determining  which  hole
the electron goes through, it cannot be so delicate that it does not
disturb the pattern in an essential way. (p. 1-9)

Note that Feynman et al. implied in their description of the uncertainty principle
that there is  an  unavoidable  interaction  between  the  measuring  instrument  (in
their  gedankenexperiment,  the  strong  light  source  emitting  photons)  and  the
physical  entity  measured.    Feynman  et  al.  also  wrote  concerning  Gedanken-
experiment 2:

the jolt given to the electron when the photon is scattered by it is
such as to change the electron’s motion enough so that if it might
have  gone  to  where  P
  [the  electron  distribution]  was  at  a
maximum [in Gedankenexperiment 1] it will instead land where
 was  at a minimum; that is why  we no longer see  the  wavy
P
interference effects. (p. 1-8)

In determining through which hole an  electron passes,  Feynman et al.,
like most physicists, maintained that the electrons are unavoidably disturbed by
the photons from the light source and it is this disturbance by the photons that
destroys  the  interference  pattern.    Indeed,  in  a  survey  of  a  number  of  the
textbooks of quantum mechanics, it is interesting  that each author,  in line with

- 7 -

Negative Observations

Feynman and Bohr,  allowed a central role in the change in  the  wave  function
that  occurs  in  a  measurement  to  a  physical  interaction  between  the  physical
existent  measured  and  some  physical  measuring  apparatus.    The  authors  of
these textbooks are Dicke and Witke (1960), Eisberg and Resnick (1974/1985),
(1993),  Merzbacher
Gasiorowicz 
(1961/1970), and Messiah (1962/1965).

(1974),  Goswami 

(1992),  Liboff 

It is important to note explicitly that some causative factor is necessary
to account for the very different distributions of the electrons in Figures 1 and
2.  Feynman et al. maintained that the physical interaction between the electrons
and photons from the light source is this factor.

Gedankenexperiment 3

Feynman  et  al.’s  gedankenexperiments  indicate  that  in  quantum
mechanics the act of taking a measurement in principle is linked  to,  and  often
affects, the physical world which is being  measured.    The  nature  of  taking  a
measurement in quantum mechanics can be  explored  further  by  considering  a
certain  variation  of  Feynman  et  al.’s  second  gedankenexperiment  (Epstein,
1945;  Renninger,  1960).8    The  results  of  this  exploration  are  even  more
surprising  than  those  presented  by  Feynman  et  al.  in  their  gedanken-
experiments.    Empirical  work  on  electron  shelving  that  supports  the  next
gedankenexperiment  has  been  conducted  by  Nagourney,  Sandberg,  and
Dehmelt (1986), Bergquist, Hulet, Itano, and Wineland (1986),  and by Sauter,
Neuhauser,  Blatt, and Toschek (1986).    This  work  has  been  summarized  by
Cook (1990).9

8 Epstein (1945) presented the essence of Gedankenexperiment 3 using the  passage of  photons
through an interferometer.  Renninger (1960) also discussed a gedankenexperiment in an article
the  essence  of
entitled  "Observations  without  Disturbing 
Gedankenexperiment 3 is presented.
9 In electron shelving, an ion is placed into a superposition of two quantum states.   In each of
these states, an electron of the ion is in one or the other of  two  energy  levels.    The transition
to one  of  the  quantum states  occurs very quickly and the  transition  to  the  other state  occurs
very slowly.  If the ion is repeatedly placed in the superposition of states after it  transitions  to
one or the other of the  superposed  states,  one  finds the  atomic  electron in  general  transitions
very frequently between the superposed quantum  states  and the  quantum state  characterized by
the very quick transition.  The photons emitted in these frequently occurring transitions  to  the
quantum  state  characterized  by  the  very  quick  transition  are  associated  with  resonance
fluorescence  of  the  ion.    The  absence  of  resonance  fluorescence  means  that  the  ion  has
transitioned into the quantum state that occurs infrequently.

Cook  (1990)  has  pointed out  that  in  the  work of  Dehmelt  and his  colleagues  on  electron
shelving  involving  the  Ba+ ion,  the  resonance  fluorescence  of  a  single  ion  is  of  sufficient

Negative Observations

In a similar arrangement  to  that  found  in  Gedankenexperiment  2,  one
can determine which of the two holes an electron went through on its way to the
backstop by using a light that is placed near only one of  the  holes  and  which
illuminates only the hole it is placed by (Figure 4).  Illuminating only one of the
holes  yields  a  distribution  of  the  electrons  similar  to  that  which  one  would
expect if the light were placed between the holes, as in Feynman et al.’s  second
gedankenexperiment.  The distribution is similar to the sum of the distributions
of electrons that one would expect if only one  or  the  other  of  the  holes  were
open at a particular time.

Moreover, when an observer knows that electrons have passed through
the  unilluminated  hole  because  they  were  not  seen  to  pass  through  the
illuminated hole,  the  distribution  of  these  electrons  through  the  unilluminated
hole resembles the distribution of electrons passing through the illuminated hole
(Figure  5).    Consider  also  the  point  that  if:  1)  the  light  is  turned  off  before
sufficient time  has  passed  allowing  the  observer  to  conclude  that  an  electron
could not have passed through the illuminated hole,  and 2) an electron has not
been observed at the illuminated hole,  the distribution of  many  such  electrons
passing through the wall is determined by an interference pattern that is the sum
of diffraction patterns of  the  waves  of  the  electrons  passing  through  the  two
holes  similar  to  that  found  in  Gedankenexperiment  1  (Epstein,  1945;
Renninger, 1960).

Discussion of the Gedankenexperiments

The immediate question is how are the results in Gedankenexperiment 3
possible given Feynman et al.’s thesis that physical interaction between the  light
source and electron is necessary to  destroy  the  interference?    Where  the  light
illuminates only hole A,  electrons passing through hole B do not interact  with
photons  from  the  light  source  and  yet  interference  is  destroyed  in  the  same
manner as if the light source illuminated both holes A and B.   In addition, the
distribution of electrons passing through hole B  at  the  backstop  indicates  that
there has been a change in the description of  these  electrons,  even  though  no
physical interaction has occurred between these electrons and photons from the
light source.

                                                                                               
intensity  to  be  detectable  by  the  dark-adapted  eye  alone,  and  the  making  of  a  negative
observation, to be discussed shortly, is thus not dependent on any measuring device external to
the observer.

Negative Observations

Epstein  (1945)  maintained  that  these  kinds  of  different  effects  on  the
physical world in quantum mechanics that cannot be ascribed to physical causes
are associated with “mental certainty” (p.  134) on the part of an observer as to
which of the possible alternatives for a  physical  existent  occurs.    Indeed,  the
factor responsible for the change in the wave function for an electron headed for
holes A and B,  and which is  not  illuminated  at  hole  A,  is  knowledge  by  the
observer as to whether there is sufficient time for an electron to pass through the
“illuminated” hole.  To borrow a term used by Renninger (1960), when the time
has elapsed in which the electron could be illuminated at hole A, and  it  is  not
illuminated, the observer makes a “negative” (p. 418) observation.

The common factor associated with the electron’s  passage  through  the
wall in a manner resembling that found for classical-like particles in Gedanken-
experiments 2 and  3  is  the  observing,  thinking  individual’s  knowledge  as  to
whether an electron passed through a particular hole.   The physical interaction
between photons from the light source and electrons passing through either hole
1  or  hole  2  is  not  a  common  factor.    It  should  be  remembered  that  some
causative  factor  is  implied  by  the  very  different  electron  distributions  in
Gedankenexperiments 1 and 2.  It is reasonable to conclude that knowledge by
the observer regarding the particular path of the electron through the  wall  is  a
factor in the change in the distribution of the electrons in Gedankenexperiment 1
to that found for electrons in Gedankenexperiments 2 and 3.

It  might  be  argued  that  in  Gedankenexperiment  3  a  non-human
recording instrument might record whether  or  not  an  electron  passed  through
the  illuminated  hole  in  the  time  allowed,  apparently  obviating  the  need  for  a
human observer.  But,  as has been shown,  a non-human recording instrument
is not necessary to obtain the results in Gedankenexperiment 3.  And yet even if
a  non-human  instrument  is  used,  ultimately  a  person  is  involved  to  read  the
results who  could still  be  responsible  for  the  obtained  results.    Furthermore,
one would still have to explain the destruction of the interference affecting  the
distribution  of  the  electrons  at  the  backstop  without  relying  on  a  physical
interaction  between  the  electrons  and  some  other  physical  existent.    Without
ultimately relying on a human observer,  this would  be  difficult  to  accomplish
when  the  non-human  recording  instrument  presumably  relies  on  physical
interactions for its functioning.

It should also be emphasized that the change in the wave function for an
electron  passing  through  the  unilluminated  hole  in  Gedankenexperiment  3
provides the general case concerning what is necessary for the change in a wave

Negative Observations

function  to  occur  in  a  measurement  of  the  physical  existent  with  which  it  is
associated.    It  was  shown  clearly  in  the  extension  of  Feynman  et  al.’s
gedankenexperiments  that  the  change  in  the  wave  function  of  an  electron  or
other physical existent is not due fundamentally to a physical  cause.    Instead,
the  change  in  the  wave  function  is  linked  to  the  knowledge  attained  by  the
observer of the circumstances affecting the physical existent measured.

There is  one  other  point  to  be  emphasized.    The  change  in  the  wave
function discussed in Gedankenexperiment 3 serves only to capture the role of
knowledge  in  negative  observation.    That  is,  one  need  not  even  present  a
discussion of the wave function to attain the result that knowledge  is a factor in
the change in the electron distribution in Gedankenexperiment 1 to the electron
distribution in Gedankenexperiments 2 and 3.   This  result depends only  on the
analysis of  experimental  results  concerning  the  electron  distributions  in  these
three gedankenexperiments.

The Schrödinger Cat
Gedankenexperiment

The nature of the change in the wave function that generally occurs in a
measurement  will  now  be  discussed  in  more  detail  in  terms  of  a  gedanken-
experiment  proposed  in  1935  by  Schrödinger.    In  his  gedankenexperiment,
Schrödinger focused on the immediate change in the wave function that occurs
upon observation of a measuring apparatus that records the value of a quantum
mechanical quantity.

A cat is penned up in a steel chamber, along with the following
diabolical  device  (which  must  be  secured  against  direct
interference by the cat): in a Geiger counter there is a tiny bit of
radioactive substance, so small, that perhaps in the course of one
hour one of the atoms decays, but also,  with equal probability,
perhaps  none;  if  it  happens,  the  counter  tube  discharges  and
through a relay releases a hammer which shatters a small flask of
hydrocyanic acid.  If one has left this entire system to itself for
an hour,  one would say that the cat  still  lives  if  meanwhile  no
atom has decayed.  The first atomic decay would have poisoned
it.   The Y
-function of the entire system would  express  this  by
having in it the living and the dead cat (pardon  the  expression)
mixed or smeared out in equal parts.

- 13 -

Negative Observations

It is typical of these cases [of which the foregoing example is
one]  that  an  indeterminancy  originally  restricted  to  the  atomic
domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminancy,
which can then be resolved by direct observation. (Schrödinger
1935/1983, p. 157)

How  does the gedankenexperiment indicate that the nature of the  wave
function as a link between cognition and the  physical  world  is  warranted?    It
does so in terms of the features of the quantum mechanical wave function cited
earlier, one being that there is no source of information concerning the physical
world in quantum mechanics other than the probabilistic  predictions  that  yield
knowledge  of  the  physical  world,  predictions  that  have  been  supported  by
empirical  test.    The  second  is  that  these  probabilities  in  general  change
immediately throughout space  upon  observation  of  a  quantity  of  the  physical
existent  that  is  described  by  the  wave  function  which  is  the  basis  for  the
probabilistic  predictions.    Importantly,  the  velocity  limitation  of  the  special
theory  precludes  a  physical  existent  from  mediating  this  change  in  the  wave
function.

Note that Schrödinger does not specify how close the observer needs to
be to the cat to resolve the indeterminancy.  The observer can, in principle, be at
any distance from the cat, even across the universe, and initiate this immediate
change  in  the  wave  function,  so  long  as  the  observer  makes  an  observation
regarding whether the cat is alive.  Indeed, the observer does not even have to
observe the cat directly but can rely on another  observer who  has observed the
cat and who tells the former observer the result of his observation.

In  a  related  vein,  Schrödinger  did  not  explicitly  discuss  the  role  and
significance of the person as observer in the measurement process in quantum
mechanics.    Physicists  often  use  the  term  “observation”  ambiguously.
Changing  the  latter  part  of  Schrödinger’s  quote  to  indicate  that  the  concern
specifically  is  with  a  person  making  the  observation  does  not  lessen  the
statement’s validity:

It is typical of these  cases  [of  which  the  foregoing  example  is
one]  that  an  indeterminancy  originally  restricted  to  the  atomic
domain becomes transformed into macroscopic indeterminancy,
which can then be resolved by direct [human] observation.

Thus,  in  a  circumstance  where  the  observer  is  specified  to  be  a  person,  the
change in the wave function is  tied  explicitly  to  the  perception  by  the  human

- 14 -

Negative Observations

observer of the cat.  This point is not  limited  to  those  circumstances  where  a
human  observer  is  explicitly  specified.    This  point  holds  in  the  general  case
where  a  non-human  macroscopic  measuring  instrument  intervenes  between  a
quantum mechanical entity and a human observer.  It is a human observer who
ultimately records the result of any observation.  In the cat gedankenexperiment,
for example, the cat acts as a macroscopic measuring instrument and comes to
be  characterized  by  the  same  probabilities  as  the  microscopic  physical
phenomenon (i.e., the radioactive substance) until a human observer makes his
own observation of the cat regarding its being alive or dead.

It should be remembered that the  Schrödinger  cat  gedankenexperiment
portrays the special case where a macroscopic measuring instrument is used to
make a measurement.  As has been shown,  Gedankenexperiment  3  discussed
above provides the general case concerning what is necessary for the change in
a wave function to occur in a measurement of the physical existent with which it
is associated.  There it was  also shown  that the change in the wave function is
linked to the knowledge attained by the observer of the circumstances affecting
the physical existent measured and that the change in this wave function is not
due fundamentally to a physical cause.

Knowledge and the Measurement of the
Spin Component of Electrons Along a Spatial Axis

It  has  been  shown  in  gedankenexperiments  using  the  two-hole
interference scenario of Feynman, Leighton, and Sands that physical  interaction
is not necessary to effect the change in the wave function that generally occurs
in  measurement  in  quantum  mechanics.    Instead,  the  general  case  is  that
knowledge is linked to the change in the wave function.  Another demonstration
of  this  point  follows.    The  models  for  gedankenexperiments  employing
electrons  (spin  one-half  particles)  presented  now  are  found  in  Feynman,
Leighton, and Sands’s (1965) chapter on spin-one particles in  their Lectures on
Physics. 
  Similar  to  the  earlier  gedankenexperiments,  these  gedanken-
experiments also  employ  negative  observation.    But  in  contrast  to  the  earlier
gedankenexperiments, readily quantifiable  results of  the  negative  observations
are developed.  In addition,  the significance of knowledge to the change of the
wave function is  emphasized  because  a  concurrent  physical  interaction  to  the
negative  observation  between  the  existent  measured  and  the  measuring
instrument  is  shown  to  be  incapable  of  effecting  the  change  in  the  wave
function.

Negative Observations

Basic Features of the Experimental Design

Consider the case of a device like a Stern-Gerlach type apparatus (device
A) which has an inhomogeneous magnetic field where the field direction and the
direction of the gradient are the same,  for example along the z axis (Figure 6).
An  electron  can  pass  along  one  of  two  paths  as  it  moves  through  the
apparatus.10  This is due to the quantization of the spin angular momentum  of
the electron, more specifically the quantization of the spin component along any
spatial axis into two possible values.

Initially,  let  an  electron  be  in  a  state  such  that  the  probabilities  of  its
going through either of the paths are equal.  Which of the two possible paths an
electron has passed through depends on whether  the electron’s spin component
along the axis of the inhomogeneous magnetic field of the device is either  in,  or
against, the direction of the magnetic  field  and  its  gradient.    Given  the  initial
probabilities, one-half of the electrons exiting from device A will be observed to
have spin up (i.e.,  in the direction of the magnetic field and gradient of device
A), and one-half of the electrons exiting device A will be observed to have spin
down (i.e., opposite to the direction of the magnetic field and gradient of device
A).   If,  after an observation is made, the electron is now  put  through  another
Stern-Gerlach type device (device C),  identical in construction to  the  first  and
oriented in the same direction, the electron will exit along the same path that it
exited from in the first machine.  In order to do this,  the electron must first be
brought back to its original direction of motion.

This  is  accomplished  through  the  use  of  another  Stern-Gerlach  type
device  (device  B),  the  spatial  orientation  of  which  is  up-down  and  right-left
reversed with respect to the first device.  In device B, the magnetic field and the
gradient are in the opposite direction along the same spatial axis  to  that  found
for device A.   The placement of these two devices is shown  in Figure 7,  with
devices A and B right next to each other.11

                                    
10 An electron is a member of a class of particles known as fermions.  The  spin  component  of
a  fermion along  any  spatial  axis  has  two  possible  values when  it  is  measured:  +1/2  (h/2p )
(spin  up  along  this  axis)  and -1/2  (h/2p )  (spin  down  along  this  axis).    The  results  of  the
gedankenexperiment hold for fermions in general.
11 Note that no pathways are shown in Figure 7 for the electrons traveling  through  device AB.
This  is  because quantum mechanics provides  the  correct description  of  the  electrons,  and  it
indicates that an electron does not travel over one or the other of the paths until an observation
of the electron is made regarding which path it traveled.  Instead, the  wave function  associated
with an electron indicates that the probability is 1/2 that it will have spin  up  along  the  z  axis
and  the  probability  is  1/2  that  it  will  have  spin  down  along  the  z  axis  when  its  spin

Two Gedankenexperiments

Consider  the  following  gedankenexperiments  that  adhere  to  quantum
mechanical principles and that are supported by empirical evidence.  They show
that  it  is  an  individual’s  knowledge  of  the  physical  world  that  is  tied  to  the
functioning of the physical world itself.

Gedankenexperiment 4

Allow that device AB has a block inserted in it as portrayed in Figure 8.
Then device AB allows only electrons with  a  spin  up  component  along  the  z
axis  to  exit  it.    Electrons  with  a  spin  down  component  along  this  axis  are
blocked from exiting.   Allow  that  R  electrons  exit  the  device  with  a  spin  up
component.  Next to device AB a second device, DE, is placed that is identical
in construction.  D is the Stern-Gerlach-like device closest to B.  The device DE
is tilted around the y  axis relative to device AB.    aR  electrons  exit  device  DE
with spin up (where 0 < a < 1).  (Spin up here is relative to the z'  axis and is in
the direction of the magnetic field and gradient of device D.)  Next to device DE
is device C in the same spatial orientation as device A of AB and its  magnetic
field and gradient in the same direction along the z axis as device A.   A block is
inserted into device C that precludes electrons with spin down  from exiting it.
baR electrons exit device C with spin up (where 0 <  b <  1).   (Spin up here is
relative to the z axis.)   (Figure 9 displays the  number  of  electrons  exiting  the
various devices in this and succeeding gedankenexperiments.)

Gedankenexperiment 5

The  experimental  arrangement  is  the  same  as  that  in  Gedanken-
experiment 4,  except that no block is inserted in device DE (Figure  10).    The
numbers of electrons coming out of each device are as follows: (1) R  electrons
exit device AB with spin up along the z axis; (2) R electrons exit device DE; and
(3) R electrons exit device C with spin up along the z axis.

Discussion of Gedankenexperiments 4 and 5

How can one account for the results of Gedankenexperiments 4 and 5?
An observer finds that R  electrons exit device C in Gedankenexperiment 5,  in
accordance with the expectation that the spin components of the electrons along
the z axis remain unaffected by the passage of the electrons through device DE.
It  appears  that  device  DE,  which  has  no  block,  has  no  effect  on  the  spin
components along the z axis of the electrons  passing  through  it.    R  electrons
exit device A with spin up along the z axis and R electrons exit device C with

only electrons with spin up along the z axis pass through device C.
(Gedankenexperiment 5)

Negative Observations

spin up along the z axis.  All electrons pass through device DE.  But Gedanken-
experiment 4 does not provide a similar result.  A similar result would be that
aR electrons would exit device C in Gedankenexperiment 4,  not baR electrons.
That is, the spin components of the electrons along the z axis would essentially
remain  unaffected  by  the  passage  of  the  electrons  through  device  DE  in
Gedankenexperiment 4,  just as device DE in  Gedankenexperiment  5  does  not
appear to affect the spin components of electrons along the z axis.    How  is  it
that baR electrons exit from device C in Gedankenexperiment 4  instead  of  aR
electrons?  It is reasonable to conclude that something unusual is happening to
the  electrons  in  their  passage  through  device  DE  in  Gedankenexperiment  4,
particularly in view of the results of Gedankenexperiment 5.  Somehow the spin
components  of  the  electrons  along  the  z  axis  are  affected  by  their  passage
through device  DE  in  Gedankenexperiment  4  while  device  DE  in  Gedanken-
experiment 5 does not affect the spin components of electrons along the z axis.

A comparison of Gedankenexperiments 4 and 5 indicates  that  the  only
physical feature of the measuring apparatus that can possibly be responsible for
the change in the component of the spin angular momentum along the z axis of
the electron is the block that is inserted in device DE in Gedankenexperiment 4.
Other  than  this  one  difference,  the  measuring  apparatuses  in  Gedanken-
experiments 4 and 5 are identical.

The Block in Device DE

The experimental consequences resulting from the presence or  absence
of the block in device DE in Gedankenexperiments 4 and 5 concern whether one
or  both  paths  are  open  in  device  DE.    Significantly,  it  is  electrons  traveling
along  the  unblocked  path  in  Gedankenexperiment  1  that  exhibit  the  unusual
behavior  regarding  the  frequency  of  electrons  exiting  device  C.    Thus,  the
nature  of  the  effect  of  the  influence  of  the  block  on  the  electrons  is  indeed
unusual  from  a  conventional  standpoint,  a  standpoint  that  would  expect  the
change in spin components along the z axis of the electrons that travel along the
unblocked  path  to  somehow  be  changed  by  a  physical  interaction  with  the
block.    This  physical  interaction,  though,  is  not  possible.    The  scenario
involving  a  block  is  thus  in  essence  a  negative  observation.    A  negative
observation occurs where an observation is made by deducing that a particular
physical event must have occurred because another physical event did not occur
with  subsequent  consequences  for  the  functioning  of  the  physical  world
stemming from the change in knowledge.  Physical interaction as the basis for
the consequences in the physical world is ruled out.    Remember  that  the  spin

- 23 -

Negative Observations

components of the electrons along the z  axis  traveling  through  device  DE  are
affected  by  the  change  in  knowledge,  as  evidenced  by  baR  electrons  exiting
device  C  in  Gedankenexperiment  4  instead  of  aR  electrons.    As  previously
noted,  empirical  work  on  electron  shelving  that  supports  the  existence  of
negative  observation  has  been  conducted  by  Nagourney,  Sandberg,  and
Dehmelt (1986), Bergquist, Hulet, Itano, and Wineland (1986),  and by Sauter,
Neuhauser, Blatt, and Toschek (1986).

A Variation of the Gedankenexperiments

Two other gedankenexperiments similar to Gedankenexperiments 4 and
5  will  provide  an  even  more  remarkable  demonstration  that  an  individual’s
knowledge of the physical world is tied to the functioning of the physical  world
itself.

Gedankenexperiment 6

The  experimental  arrangement  is  the  same  as  that  in  Gedanken-
experiment 4, except that the blocks are inserted in devices DE and C such that
spin up electrons along z' and z, respectively, cannot exit these devices and spin
down electrons are allowed to proceed unimpeded (Figure 11).  The numbers of
electrons coming out of each device are as  follows: (1)  R  electrons exit device
AB with spin up along the z  axis;  (2)  vR  electrons  exit  device  DE  with  spin
down  along the z'  axis; and (3)  uvR  electrons  exit  device  C  with  spin  down
along the z axis.

Gedankenexperiment 7

The  experimental  arrangement  is  the  same  as  that  in  Gedanken-
experiment  6,  except  that  device  DE  has  both  paths  open  (Figure  12).    The
numbers of electrons coming out of each device are as follows: (1) R  electrons
exit device AB with spin up along the z axis; (2) R electrons exit device DE; and
(3) 0 electrons exit device C with spin down along the z axis.

Discussion of Gedankenexperiments 6 and 7

The  result  in  Gedankenexperiment  6  is  remarkable.    How  is  it  that
electrons with spin down along the axis of the magnetic field of the measuring
device A, oriented in a particular direction along z,  are found exiting device C,
in which the axis of its magnetic field and its gradient are also  oriented  in  the
same  direction  along  z?    No  electron  with  spin  down  along  the  z  axis  exits
device AB.  This result is particularly unusual when in Gedankenexperiment 7,

Negative Observations

using  the  same  device  DE,  modified  only  by  the  removal  of  the  block  that
prevents electrons with a spin up component along z'  (the axis of the magnetic
field in DE) to pass,  there are no electrons that exit device  C  with  spin  down
along the axis of its magnetic field, which has the same spatial orientation as the
magnetic field of A along the z axis.

In Gedankenexperiment 7,  it appears as if the  spin  components  of  the
electrons along the z axis were not affected by their passage through device DE,
which  has  both  paths  open  and  which  thus  allowed  all  electrons  to  pass
through.  As reflected in the behavior of the electrons that pass  through device
C, the spin components of the electrons along the z axis in Gedankenexperiment
6 are affected by device DE, specifically  by  the  insertion  of  the  block  in  this
device that prevents electrons with spin up components along the z'  axis from
exiting device DE.  Again, no electrons with  spin  down  along  this  axis  were
found to exit device AB.   The electrons traveling along the  unblocked  path  in
device DE in Gedankenexperiment 6 exhibit this unusual behavior regarding the
frequency of  electrons exiting device C.    No  physical  interaction  between  the
block  in  device  DE  and  any  electron  traveling  along  the  unblocked  path  is
responsible  for  the  frequency  of  electrons  exiting  device  C.    In  Gedanken-
experiment  6,  a  negative  observation  at  device  DE  has  resulted  in  electrons
exiting device C with spin down  along the z axis whereas in the absence  of  a
negative observation, in Gedankenexperiment 7, no electrons exit device C with
spin down along the z axis.

Interference

The difference in the observer’s knowledge of the spin components  of
electrons  along  an  axis,  and  the  difference  in  the  spin  components  of  the
electrons  themselves,  in  the  pairs  of  gedankenexperiments  that  have  been
presented (i.e., Gedankenexperiments 4 and 5, and 6 and 7) reflect the presence
or  absence  of  interference  in  the  wave  functions  associated  with  each  of  the
electrons.  For  example, in terms of the formalism, in  Gedankenexperiment  4
the  probability  amplitude  a
  for  an  electron  exiting  device  AB  with  spin  up
1
(AB+) and exiting device C with spin up (C+) is given by

 = <C+|DE+> <DE+|AB+>  .  
a

(21)

The probability of these events is derived by taking the absolute  square of this
.    In  contrast,  in  Gedankenexperiment  5,  the
probability  amplitude,  |a
probability amplitude d for an electron exiting device AB with  spin  up  (AB+)
and exiting device C with spin up (C+) is given by

d = <C+|DE-> <DE-|AB+> + <C+|DE+> <DE+|AB+>  .

(22)

When the absolute square of the probability amplitude d is calculated to yield the
probability that an electron exiting device AB with  spin  up  will  exit  device  C
with spin up, it is evident that there will be two terms representing interference.
These terms are

 (<C+|DE-> <DE-|AB+>)* (<C+|DE+> <DE+|AB+>)  

(23a)

and

or

 (<C+|DE+> <DE+|AB+>)* (<C+|DE-> <DE-|AB+>)  .

It is important to emphasize that it is not the presence or absence of the
block  in  device  DE  that  interacts  with  electrons  that  is  responsible  for  the
presence or absence of interference in Gedankenexperiments 4 and 6.   It is the
act of knowing the value of the spin component of the electron along the z'  axis
that is responsible.  The block in device DE in Gedankenexperiment 4 and the
block  in  device  DE  in  Gedankenexperiment  6  serve  as  bases  for  negative
observations.

Another Indication of the Importance of Knowledge
in Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

There is one more feature of the gedankenexperiments discussed in this
paper  that  supports  the  theses  that:  1)  the  macroscopic  nature  of  a  physical
apparatus  used  for  a  measuring  instrument  is  not  central  to  making  a
measurement in quantum mechanics;  2)  knowledge  is  central  to  making  such
measurements;  and  3)  the  role  of  the  block  in  device  DE  in  Gedanken-
experiments  4  and  6  is  to  provide  information.    Gedankenexperiments  4
through 7 demonstrate the interesting point that the magnetic field of device DE
itself is not sufficient to induce the change in the wave function that device DE
which  has  a  block  along  one  path  does  for  electrons  traveling  along  the
unblocked path and with which the block does not physically interact.  Unless

- 28 -

S
S
Negative Observations

there is some way in  the  physical  set  up  of  device  DE  to  determine  the  spin
component of the electron along an axis z' (as is done in Gedankenexperiments
4 and 6 by the block in device DE), there is no change in the wave function of
the electron concerning its spin components.

In Gedankenexperiment 5 where there is no possibility  in  the  physical
set up that is device DE to know  the spin component of the electron in  device
DE  (because  a  block  is  not  inserted  along  either  the  “spin  up”  or  the  “spin
down” path), device DE does not affect the spin components along the z axis of
the electrons as they travel through.   That  is,  the  number  of  electrons  exiting
devices C and AB are exactly the  same.    Also,  in  gedankenexperiment  7,  no
electrons with spin down along the z axis exit device C and only electrons with
spin  up  along  the  z  axis  exit  device  AB.    Without  a  block  in  device  DE  in
Gedankenexperiment 7, there is no change in the wave function of an electron
as regards its spin components.  This is equivalent to saying that there has been
no measurement of the spin component along the z'  axis  of  the  electron.    To
quote Feynman et al. (1965) regarding their filtering experiments with spin-one
particles similar in principle to Gedankenexperiments 4 and 6:

The  past  information  [concerning  spin  along  the  z  axis  after
exiting the first device] is not lost by the separation into...beams
[in the second device], but by the blocking masks that are put in
[the second device] (p. 5-9).

In  conclusion,  if  an  interaction  between  a  macroscopic  physical
apparatus and the existent to be measured were responsible for a change in the
wave function of the physical existent measured,  why,  if  a  magnetic  field  by
itself is unable to effect this change in the  wave  function  for  electrons,  is  the
insertion of a block able to effect this change for electrons traveling through the
unblocked path?  When device DE does not contain  a  block  along  one  of  the
paths,  electrons 
in
Gedankenexperiment 4 or the unblocked path in Gedankenexperiment 6 do not
undergo  any  change  in  their  wave  function.    The  role  of  the  block  in
Gedankenexperiments 4 and 6 is to provide  information  to  a  human  observer
concerning electrons traveling along the unblocked path.   With regard to these
electrons, the role of  the  block  in  the  measurement  of  their  spin  components
along the z'  axis does not depend on a physical interaction  between  them  and
the block.

Negative Observations

The Time of a Measurement

The question is often asked concerning quantum mechanics how  can an
observer finding out about a measurement that has presumably been made some
time  earlier  be  linked  to  the  measurement  itself?    In  terms  of  Gedanken-
experiment 4,  for example, if a human observer  finds  out  about  the  electrons
passing through the devices AB, DE, and C only after the electrons exit device
C,  how  can  this  observer  be  considered  responsible  in  some  way  for  a
measurement that was  presumably made at device DE because of the inclusion
of the block in that device?  That is,  a negative observation seems to be  made
only after the electrons exit device C, even though the block in device DE made
the information available earlier (i.e.,  as soon  as the time elapsed in  which  an
electron passing through device DE could reach the block at the end of D).

The  analysis  underlying  the  question  presumes  that  some  form  of
physical interaction occurring within a temporal framework provides  the  basis
for  measurement  in  quantum  mechanics  even  though  it  clearly  does  not.    In
Gedankenexperiment  4,  this  presumed  physical  interaction  does  not  occur  in
device DE.    Measurement  in  quantum  mechanics  is  fundamentally  concerned
with the development of knowledge.  The course of physical interactions over
time  is  not  the  central  factor  in  the  development  of  this  knowledge.    It  is
knowledge that is primary  and  within  this  knowledge,  the  functioning  of  the
physical world, including the course of physical interactions over time, occurs.

As  has  been  discussed,  there  are  other  indications  for  this  view
concerning the importance of knowledge in quantum mechanics.  Knowledge of
the  physical  world  is  developed  using  wave  functions,  and  wave  functions
provide only probabilistic knowledge.  The quantum mechanical wave function
associated with  a  physical  existent  generally  changes  immediately  throughout
space  upon  measurement  of  the  physical  existent.    This  change  in  the  wave
function is not limited by the velocity limitation of the special theory of relativity
for physical existents, the velocity of light  in  vacuum.    There  is  the  complex
number  nature  of  the  wave  function  from  which  information  concerning  the
physical world is derived.

The Effect of Measurement on the Past

One  other  point  provides  support  for  the  central  significance  of
knowledge in measurement in quantum mechanics.  In Gedankenexperiments 4
and 6, the presence of the block,  or more accurately the knowledge that results
from  the  presence  of  the  block,  at  the  exit  of  device  D  affects  the  electrons

traveling along the unblocked path in device D from their entry into device D for
two reasons:

1.

If the block is removed prior to  the  end  of  the  time  over
which  an  electron  could  traverse  device  D  along  the
blocked path, interference would not be destroyed and the
number 
in
Gedankenexperiment  4  (i.e.,  with  spin  up  along  the  z
axis), for example, is the same as the number of electrons
exiting device AB.

2. With the block in place and the time elapsed over which an
electron  could  have  reached  the  block  in  device  D,  the
interference that was  supposed to characterize the electron
in  its  passage  through  device  D  did  not  occur  as  the
electron  could  have  traveled  along  only  the  unblocked
path.   If a detector had been set up along  any  part  of  the
path in device D containing the block prior to the electron’s
having  reached  the  end  of  device  D  where  the  block  is
situated, the electron would not have  been  detected  along
the path containing the block.

A  negative  observation  that  the  block  allows  for  by  providing
information to an observer is thus seen to affect one’s knowledge of the past as
well as the past itself, in the present case indicating that the electron has traveled
down a particular path in device D as opposed to being characterized by a wave

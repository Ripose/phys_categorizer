Data Mining 

Classifying ancient texts 
by inter-word spacing 

In  the  1940s,  Claude  Shannon  ap-
plied  statistical  concepts  to  both  written 
text and genetics, pioneering the field of 
information  theory1.  The  seminal  paper 
that  exploited  Shannon’s  concept  of  in-
formation entropy for the study of DNA 
sequences was  by  Mantegna et al2. Due 
to  the  mapping  of  the  human  genome, 
there  is  renewed  interest  in  statistical 
techniques  for  classification  and  data 
mining  of  DNA  sequences3.  Given  that 
DNA  sequences  can  be  viewed  as  pos-
sessing  a 4  letter alphabet {A, C, G,  T} 
it  is  not  surprising  that  data  mining  and 
classification  of  text  has  inspired  tech-
niques  for  DNA  and  vice  versa.  Recent 
advances in these  areas have  been dem-
onstrated by Ortuño et al4 and Benedetto 
et al5, for example. 

Ortuño  et  al4  have  explored  both 
written texts and DNA using a powerful 
new  idea  of  inter-word  spacing  for  ex-
tracting keywords. The inter-word spac-
ing is defined as the word count between 
a  word  and  the  next  occurrence  of  the 
same  word  in  a  text.  All  the  inter-word 
spaces,  for  each  case,  are  then  counted 
up  and  the  standard  deviation  is  com-
puted. This is then repeated for different 
words  –  the  words  are  then  ranked  ac-
cording to the standard deviation values, 
the  highest  first.  The  standard  deviation 
 is then plotted versus the logarithm of 
the  rank.  Ortuño  et  al4  have  found  that 
words with the highest s
 ranking tend to 
make  better  search  engine  keywords,  as 
opposed to words with high hit counts. 

We  demonstrate  a  striking  new  re-
sult;  in  Figure  1,  where  standard  devia-
tion  versus  log  of  rank  is  plotted  for 
Koine  Greek  source  texts  of  the  New 
Testament6.  For  simplicity  only 
the 
books  of  Luke,  Matthew  and  Acts  are 
plotted  here.  The  close  match  between 
the  curves  for  Acts  and  Luke,  compared 
to other books, appears to add weight to 
what  has  always  been  accepted  by 
scholars; namely that the author of Luke 
was identical to that of Acts. 

 

To  check  the  significance  of  this 
match we introduce the idea of a quanti-
tative  measure  obtained  by  comparing 
variances  in  spacing  between  words 
common to all the texts under examina-
tion. We use a two-distribution  (cid:0)2 meas-
ure  on  the  variances  s 2  of  top-ranked 

Figure 1 The standard deviation s
 of the inter-word spacing (y-axis) for each word is ranked 
in  descending  order  on  a  logarithmic  scale  (x-axis).  Using  the  original  Koine  Greek  text,  a 
remarkably  close  match  is  obtained  between  the  book  of  Luke  and  the  book  of  Acts  in  the 
New Testament, which were written by the same author.  For reference, a curve of a different 
author  is shown (book of Matthew) illustrating a distinct separation (this is  the  upper curve). 
Although  the  match  between  Luke  &  Acts deviates  for  a  log  rank  <1.2,  this  represents  less 
than 4% of the total curve (due to the logarithmic scale). Note that uncommon words occur-
ring less than 5 times in each text are not included in the ranking, as their s
 values are not 
significant. 

keywords; the (cid:0)2 values for pairs of texts 
are put into the table below, with a lower 
(cid:0)2  indicating  a  closer  match.  This  gives 
the  following  result  for  the  gospels  and 
Acts.

As  a  check  against  a  known  bench-
mark,

pectations  and  Barnaby  Rudge)  and 
Thomas  Hardy  (Jude  the  Obscure  and 
Tess of the d’Urbervilles):

As  expected,  lowest  (cid:0)2  scores  are  ob-
tained for the correct author match. 

A  source  of  considerable  historical 
debate  has  been  the  question  of  author-
ship of the book of Hebrews in the New 
Testament.  An  open  question  would  be 
to apply our technique to possibly elimi-
nate some of the conjectured authors. 

In conclusion, our results add weight 
to the generally accepted hypothesis of a 
common  author  between  the  books  of 
Luke  and  Acts.  Future  developments  in 
this area may shed some light on a num-
ber of historical debates surrounding the 
question  of  authorship.  Applying  these 
types of tests to DNA may be of interest 
in the study of phylogenic relationships.

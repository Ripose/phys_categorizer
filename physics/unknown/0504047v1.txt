Abstract 

DNA base-gold interactions are studied theoretically at the DFT level using Au3 and Au4 
clusters  as  simple  catalytic  models  for  Au  particles.  The  bonding  between  DNA  bases 
and gold clusters occurs via the anchoring of a Au atom to the N or O atoms of the bases. 
In  the  most  stable  planar  base-Au3  complexes,  the  Au-N  or  Au-O  anchor  bonds  are 
(cid:215) Au bonds. The mechanism of formation of these nonconventional H-
reinforced by N-H(cid:215)
bonds is discussed.

DNA - gold interactions play an important role in nano- and biotechnology (see1-5 

and  references  therein).  Recent  experimental  studies  have  shown  that  the  DNA  bases, 

adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) interact with Au surfaces and Au 
clusters,  and  adsorb  at  Au  electrodes  in  a  complex  and  sequence-dependent  manner.4,5 
Their relative affinities to adsorb on polycrystalline Au films are ordered as A > C (cid:1) G > 
T.4a  Mirkin  and  co-workers4b  have  recently  reported  that  the  heats  of  desorption  of  the 
nucleic  acid  bases  from  Au  thin  films  vary  within  26.3  -  34.9  kcal(cid:215) mol-1  and  obey  the 

following order: G > A (cid:1) C > T. Chen et al. [4d] and Giese and McNaughton [4e] have 

suggested  that  adenine  binds  Au  via  the  N6  exocyclic  amino  group  and  the  N7  atom. 

However,  the  mechanism  of  binding  of  DNA  bases  with  gold  as  well  as  the  precise 

geometries  of  their  complexes  remain  still  unknown.  These  issues  are  addressed  in  the 

present work. 

We investigate theoretically the interaction of DNA bases with bare Au3 and Au4 

gold clusters as simple catalytic models of Au particles6, using the density functional 

B3LYP potential together with the energy-consistent 19-valence electron relativistic 

effective core potential for gold developed by Ermler, Christiansen, and co-workers7 (see 

also8 for current work and references therein) and the 6-31+G(d) basis set  for DNA 

bases, as they are implemented in the GAUSSIAN 03 package of quantum chemical 

programs.9 All geometrical optimizations use the keywords “tight” and “Int=UltraFine”. 

The harmonic vibrational frequencies, zero-point vibrational energies (ZPVE), and 

enthalpies were also calculated. The reported binding energies include the ZPVE 

correction. In order to assess basis-set effects, some selected DNA base-gold structures 

were further studied at the B3LYP/RECP (gold) ¨

 6-31++G(d,p) (DNA base) 

computational level.  

Single gold atom – DNA bases complexes are characterized by very low binding 

energies:  adenine  (2.2  -  2.5  kcal(cid:215) mol-1),  guanine  (0.8  kcal(cid:215) mol-1),  and  cytosine  (1.2  and 

3.8  kcal(cid:215) mol-1),  whereas no  stable  complex  is formed  with  thymine.  On  the  other  hand, 

 

2 

the  binding  energy  of  a  bare  Au3  gold  cluster  to  DNA  bases  (see  Table  1)  is  about  an 

order  of  magnitude  higher.  The  most  stable  base-Au3  complexes are  planar  and  formed 

either  via  Au-N  or  Au-O  coordinative  (“anchor”)  bonds  (Figures  1-4).  The  Au3  cluster 

preferentially binds adenine at N1, N3, and N7 (figure 1), thymine at O2 and O4 (figure 2), 

guanine at the N3, O6 and N7 atoms (figure 3), and cytosine at O2 and N3 (figure 4). The 

binding  energies  are  larger  (they  fall  within  the  interval  of  20.7  -  25.4  kcal(cid:215) mol-1),  for 

complexes with a Au-N anchor bond than for complexes with a Au-O one (for the latter, 

Eb 

  10.5  -  20.0  kcal(cid:215) mol-1),  indicating  that  the  Au-N  bonding  is  stronger. 

Correspondingly,  the  Au-N  bonds  are  also  shorter,  ranging  from  2.130  to  2.153  Å, 

compared  to  the  Au-O  ones  (2.177  -  2.239  Å).  The  most  stable  complex  has  a  binding 

energy Eb = 25.4 kcal(cid:215) mol-1 and is formed between cytosine and Au3 anchored to the N3 

atom  on  the  N2  side.  The  complexes  A(cid:215) Au3,  G(cid:215) Au3,  and  C(cid:215) Au3  with  the  Au3  -  amino 

nitrogen bonding (also shown in Figures 1, 3, and 4) are nonplanar and less stable, viz., 

Eb(A(cid:215) Au3(N6))  =  14.5,  Eb(G(cid:215) Au3(N2))  =  9.1,  and  Eb(C(cid:215) Au3(N4))  =  11.2  kcal(cid:215) mol-1.  In 

agreement with the experiments by Lindsay and co-workers1a (see also4g), the complexes 

between T and Au3 anchored to the N1 and N3 atoms are unstable. A comparison of the 

binding  energies  of  planar  and  nonplanar  base-Au3  complexes  leads  to  the  following 

order for the affinities of the DNA bases to Au3: C > A > G > T. Since the purines A and 

G possess four and six anchoring sites for Au3, respectively, and the pyrimidines C and T 

have  only  three,  the  mean  values  of  the  binding  energies,  averaged  over  the  number  of 

sites, are reordered as A > C > G > T.  

The binding energies of the most stable base-Au3 complexes and their anchor bond 

lengths  are not fully correlated (see Table 1). For example, the most stable complex 
C(cid:215) Au3(N3) shown in Figure 4 has a Au-N anchor bond of 2.164 Å whereas the shortest 
one, 2.130 Å, is found in A(cid:215) Au3(N7) whose Eb = 22.3 kcal(cid:215) mol–1. The reason is that

˛
the  anchor  bonds  in  all  reported  planar  base-Au3  complexes,  except  G(cid:215) Au3(N7),  are 
reinforced  by  the  N-H(cid:215)
(cid:215) Au  bonds.  Note  that  a  similar  bonding  may  also  occur 
between  the  amino  groups  and  Au3  in  the  complexes  A(cid:215) Au3(N6),  G(cid:215) Au3(N2),  and 
C(cid:215) Au3(N4)  (see  Figures  1,  3  and  4)  but  these  bonds  are  much  weaker  since  their 
corresponding  bond  angles  — NHAu  »
  100o.  Regarding  the  aforementioned  complex 
(cid:215) Au11, bond may also be formed therein due to 
G(cid:215) Au3(N7), an extremely weak, C8-H8(cid:215)
the very weak proton donor ability of the C8-H8 group10e. 

 The non conventional N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au bonds that are present in the most stable 

complexes are similar to conventional weak hydrogen bonds since they obey all the 

necessary prerequisites (see10 and references therein) of the conventional ones, viz.: (i) 

there exists an evidence of the bond formation; (ii) there exists an evidence that this bond 

specifically involves a hydrogen atom which is bonded to Au predominantly along the N-

H bond direction; (iii) the N-H bond elongates relative to that in the monomer; (iv) there 

exists a van der Waals cutoff: the hydrogen bond separation r(H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au) is shorter than the 

sum of van der Waals radii of H and Au (2.86 Å); (v) the stretching mode v(N-H) 

undergoes a red shift with respect to that in the isolated base and its IR intensity 

increases; and finally, (vi) proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) chemical shifts 

in the N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au hydrogen bond are shifted downfield compared to the monomer.11 The 

key features of the N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au bonds of the planar base-Au3 complexes that are gathered in 

Table 1 demonstrate that these bonds satisfy all the conditions (i) - (vi). Therefore, they 

can be treated as the nonconventional hydrogen ones, by analogy with other 

nonconventional hydrogen bonds with transition metals.12 

Let us now focus on some specific features of these bonds. Among all the studied 

complexes A(cid:215) Au3, the largest red shift of the n (N9-H9) stretch (252 cm-1) is predicted for 

the hydrogen bond N9-H9(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au11 in A(cid:215) Au3(N3) (see Figure 1). This can be understood 

from the fact that the N9-H9 bond of A is characterized by the smallest deprotonation

energy (enthalpy) compared to the other N-H bonds, viz., DPE(N9-H9) =  336.8 kcal(cid:215) mol-

1 < DPE(N6-H6') = 355.2 kcal(cid:215) mol-1 < DPE(N6-H6) =  355.8 kcal(cid:215)  mol-1,13 and, therefore, 

it is more strongly perturbed by the Au3 cluster than the amino protons. The three shortest 

N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au H-bonds (2.580 – 2.627 Å) are found in the complexes G(cid:215) Au3(O6; N1 side), 

T(cid:215) Au3(O2; N1 side), and C(cid:215) Au3(O2; N1 side). The corresponding N-H stretching modes are 

characterized by the largest red shifts (302, 324, and 306 cm-1), the largest IR 

enhancement factors (15, 11 and 14), and the largest displacements, 0.014 - 0.017 Å, of 

the bridging proton toward the gold atom acting as a nonconventional proton acceptor. 

The high stabilization of these hydrogen bonds is explained by the small deprotonation 

energies of the involved N-H groups: DPE(N1-H1; G) = 338.4 kcal(cid:215) mol-1, DPE(N1-H1; T) 

= 334.2 kcal(cid:215) mol-1 < DPE(N3-H3; T) = 346.6 kcal(cid:215) mol-1, and DPE(N1-H1; C) =  345.2 

kcal(cid:215) mol-1 < DPE(N4-H4; C) =  354.2 kcal(cid:215) mol-1.13 The former inequality also partly 

explains the difference of 3.6 kcal(cid:215) mol-1 in the binding energies of the complexes 

T(cid:215) Au3(O2; N1 side) and T(cid:215) Au3(O2; N3 side) (see Figure 2) that exhibit quite similar anchor 

bonds Au7-O2. We also notice that the difference in the deprotonation energies of the N9-

H9 and N2-H2' groups of G, viz., DPE(N9-H9) = 336.4 kcal(cid:215) mol-1 < DPE(N2-H2') = 343.0 

kcal(cid:215) mol-1,13 explains the difference between the hydrogen bonds N9-H9(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au11 and N2-

H2(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au11 in the complexes G(cid:215) Au3(N3; N2 side) and G(cid:215) Au3(N3; N9 side) (see Figure 3). 

The  changes  in  the  NMR  chemical  shift  d

iso(H)  (prerequisite  (vi))  of  the  bridging 

proton in the studied N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au H-bonds are all negative and fall within a narrow interval 

of -1.8 to -3.2 ppm that is close to d

iso(H) = -2.8 ppm of the water dimer.11c This implies 

that the base - gold interaction induces a deshielding of the bridging proton. The range of 

the  anisotropic  shifts  d

an(H)  is  much  wider,  from  10.2  to  18.7  ppm,  and  is  also  rather 

close to that of the water dimer.11c The largest one, 18.7 ppm, is found for the complex

In  general,  the  data  used  in  prerequisites  (iii)  –  (v)  (see  also  Table  1)  provide  an 

estimate  of  the  hydrogen  bonding  interaction  energy,  EHB.  For  the  nonconventional  N-

H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au hydrogen bonding studied here, such an estimation is not possible because of the 

presence  of  the  anchor  bond,  that  plays  a  key  role  in  the  H-bond  formation.  We  can 

obtain an approximate upper bound for |EHB| by comparing the binding energies, say, of 

the planar complexes G(cid:215) Au3(O6; N1 side) and G(cid:215) Au3(O6; N7 side) (see figure 3). They are 

characterized  by  the  same  Au-O  anchor  bond,  but  while  G(cid:215) Au3(O6;  N1  side)  exhibits  a 

nonconventional N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au hydrogen bond, there is no such bond for G(cid:215) Au3(O6; N7 side). 

This  gives  the  upper  boun  of  |EHB|  (cid:2)  7.9  kcal(cid:215) mol-1.  However,  the  anchor  bond  in 

G(cid:215) Au3(O6; N1 side) is much stronger than in the G(cid:215) Au3(O6; N7 side) (2.186 vs. 2.239 Å), 

so that the upper bound given above should be lowered to 3 - 5 kcal(cid:215) mol-1 that reasonably 

agrees with the upper-bound found for similar nonconventional hydrogen bondings.14  

In  order  to  assess  basis-set  effects,  two  complexes,  A(cid:215) Au3(N3)  and  G(cid:215) Au3(O6;  N1 

side),  respectively  with  the  Au-N  and  Au-O  anchor  bonds,  were  further  investigated  at 

the  higher computational  level  B3LYP/RECP  (gold)  ¨

  6-31++G(d,p)  (DNA  base).  It  is 

shown  in  Table  1  that  the  latter  produces  minor  changes  in  nearly  all  the  examined 

properties of these two complexes. Two other complexes, A(cid:215) Au4(N3) and G-Au4(O6; N1 

side),  with  a  T-shape  four-gold  cluster  were  also  studied  at  this  level  (Figure  5).  Their 

binding energies amount to 28.8 and 24.2 kcal(cid:215) mol-1, respectively. The former possesses a 

very  short  (2.126  Å)  Au-N  anchor  bond.  Its  N9-H9  bond  is  directed  almost 

perpendicularly 

to 

the  centre  of 

the  diatomic  bond  Au11-Au12  forming 

two 

nonconventional  H-bonds:  N9-H9(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au11  and  N9-H9(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au13,  that  results  in  a  large  D

(N9-

H9) red shift of 275 cm-1

. In the latter complex, Au-O anchor bond is rather short (2.157

Å),  and  two  almost  linear  N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au  H-bonds  are  formed  with  guanine,  viz.,  the  N1-

H1(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au11 with D

n( N1-H1) = -172 cm-1 and the N2-H2(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au12 with D

(N2-H2) = -191 cm-1. 

In conclusion, we have shown that the bonding between DNA base and odd-size 

and  even-size  gold  clusters,  Au3  and  Au4,  occurs  via  the  anchor  Au-N  or  Au-O  bonds.  

For  all  the  possible  binding  sites  of  DNA,  the  structural,  energetic,  and  spectroscopic 

features  of  the  planar  and,  less  stable  nonplanar,  base-Au3,4  complexes  have  been 

investigated. A novel type of nonconventional N-H(cid:215)

(cid:215) Au hydrogen bonding, that is formed 

in the most stable planar complexes between nucleic acid bases and triangle Au3 and T-

shape Au4 gold clusters, has been identified. It is the formation of the anchor bond, either 

Au-N  or  Au-O,  in  the  planar  base-Au3,4  complexes  that  cooperatively,  through  charge 

redistribution, “catalyzes” one of the unanchored gold atom to serve as a nonconventional 

proton  acceptor  and  to  form,  via  its  lone  pair  5d  orbital,  a  nonconventional  hydrogen 

bonding  with  the  conventional  proton  donor  of  DNA  base.  In  addition,  under  the 

assumption  of  a  single-site  base-Aun  binding,  the  reported  affinities  of  DNA  bases  for 

Au3  exhibit  a  fair  correlation  in  magnitude  and  in  relative  order  with  the  experimental 

findings. Note however that some reported anchoring sites of DNA bases are blocked by 

sugar residues for ssDNA as well as by the intramolecular hydrogen bonds for dsDNA, 

whereas the remaining sites are available for multi-site bindings. The work on interaction 

of the DNA duplexes with gold clusters will be published elsewhere [15].

Figure 1. The four possible planar (N1, N3, N7) and nonplanar (N6)  binding sites of 
the gold cluster Au3 to adenine. Also shown is the NH2 anchored complex A(cid:215) Au3 
(N6). For each complex, the anchor bond is drawn as a thick (red) line and the 
nonconventional H-bond as a dotted line. The stability ordering of the complexes is 
(see also Table 1): A(cid:215) Au3(N3) > A(cid:215) Au3(N1) > A(cid:215) Au3(N7) > A(cid:215) Au3(N6). The bond 
lengths are given in Å and bond angles in deg.

Chemically Induced Dynamic Nuclear 
Polarization of 19F Nuclei 
 
A thesis submitted for the degree of 
Doctor of Philosophy 
by

Trinity term 2005 

 

This study explores, both theoretically and experimentally, the photochemically 
induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) of 19F nuclei, the associated spin 
relaxation,  cross-relaxation  and  cross-correlation  effects,  as  well  as  potential 
applications of 19F CIDNP to protein structure and folding problems. 
 

It was demonstrated that in the flavin mononucleotide / 3-fluorotyrosine system 
and  in  the  whole  class  of  structurally  related  photochemical  systems  the  19F  spin 
polarization exceeds the Boltzmann level by nearly two orders of magnitude and may be 
sustained in this elevated state indefinitely by continuous laser irradiation of the sample. 
 

A  theoretical  model  describing  photo-CIDNP  magnetization  evolution  in  a 
continuously  photochemically  pumped  fluorine-proton  nuclear  system  was  assembled 
and  tested.  It  was  found  that  an  accurate  account  of  DD-CSA  cross-correlation  is 
essential  for  the  correct  description  of  the  temporal  behaviour  and  relaxation  of  the 
chemically  pumped  13C,  15N  and  19F  nuclear  magnetic  systems.  The  sign  and  the 
amplitude  of  the  observed  19F  CIDNP  effect  were  found  to  depend  strongly  on  the 
effective rotational diffusion correlation time, giving an in situ probe of this parameter 
for these rapidly evolving systems. The origin of this effect has been traced to electron-
nuclear cross-relaxation effects in the intermediate radicals. 
 

To counteract light intensity decay in optically dense samples, an efficient and 
inexpensive  method  for  in  situ  laser  illumination  of  NMR  samples  inside  the  narrow 
superconducting magnet bore has been developed. It utilises a stepwise tapered optical 
fibre to deliver light uniformly along the axis of a 5 mm NMR tube. 
 

Application  of  the  theoretical  and  experimental  framework  described  above  to 
the uniformly fluorotyrosinated Green Fluorescent Protein and Trp-cage protein allowed 
the  characterization  of  the  protein  surface  structure  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the 
fluorotyrosine  residues,  and  provided  information  on  the  motional  regimes  of  all  the 
labelled residues. 

 
The  results  demonstrate  the  power  and  versatility  of  CIDNP  based  structure 
investigation  methods,  particularly  for  mapping  out  the  solvent-accessible  amino  acid 
residues and their surroundings and giving an order of magnitude sensitivity increase in 
19F nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.

Chapter 1 
Theoretical framework 
T 

 
his  Chapter  provides  the  theoretical  and  phenomenological  background  for 
the  rest  of this  Thesis. It is assumed  that  the reader is  closely  familiar with 
the  density  operator  description  of  quantum  mechanical  ensembles  and 

 

general magnetic resonance.  
 
 
1.1 Brief review of spin relaxation theory in non-viscous liquids 
 
1.1.1. General formalism 

The IUPAC Gold Book [1] defines relaxation in the following way: “if a system 
is  disturbed  from  its  state  of  equilibrium,  it  relaxes  to  that  state,  and  the  process  is 
referred  to  as  relaxation.  The  branch  of  kinetics  concerned  with  such  processes  is 
known  as  relaxation  kinetics”.  Relaxation  and  its  formal  description  known  as 
relaxation theory are ubiquitous in magnetic resonance. 

 

Beyond  providing  us  with  the  NMR  signal  as  such,  relaxation  yields  valuable 
structural  information:  inter-particle  distances  (from  Overhauser  effects  [2],  residual 
dipolar couplings [3], paramagnetic shifts and relaxation rates [4]), relative orientations 
and  angles  (from  cross-correlations  between  anisotropic  interactions  [5]),  degrees  of 
motion restriction as well as local and global molecular motion correlation times (from 
magnetic field dependence of relaxation rates [6]). Most of the spin relaxation analysis 
techniques  rely  on  a  remarkably  compact  and  elegant  general  treatment  known  as 
Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness theory [7]. BRW theory is essentially a second-order time-
dependent  perturbation  theory,  and  although  it  works  extremely  well  in  most  cases  of 
practical  importance,  it  is  notorious  for  its  bulky  intermediate  expressions.  In  the 
treatment below, however, the tedious mathematics has been relegated to Mathematica 
[8], so we can concentrate on ideas and answers  rather than on overcoming algebraic 
hurdles. 
 

 
The starting point in the original formulation of relaxation theory [9-11] with a 
semi-classical treatment of the lattice is the Liouville-von Neumann equation governing

In  this  expansion  the  basis  operators  are  static  and  the  coefficients  are  stochastic

by  rotational  modulation  of  anisotropic  interactions,  the  most  convenient  choice  is

In the general case this equation is still just as difficult to solve as (1.1). In non-viscous 
liquids however, we can make further progress by assuming that the ensemble averages 
may  be  performed  independently  on  the  rotational  function  part  and  the  spin  operator 
part of (1.8), this approximation was experimentally found to be valid [7]. After noting

(1.10) 

For  molecules  with  an  effective  dynamic  radius  smaller  than  50  Å  in  common 
solvents  the  correlation  functions  (1.10)  decay  with  characteristic  times  (called 
correlation  times)  of  the  order  of  pico-  to  nanoseconds.  To  eliminate  the  integral  in 
(1.9)  and  facilitate  the  actual  calculation,  the  so-called  coarse-graining  of  time  is 
  can  be 
introduced,  in  which  it  is  assumed  that  the  entire  integral  that  wraps 
Dˆ
tρ .  This  seemingly  gross 
approximated  by  a  constant  superoperator  acting  on 
approximation is actually quite accurate so long as the resulting relaxation time is much 
longer than the correlation time of the stochastic functions (1.10). The latter assumption 
also  allows  us  to  extend  the  upper  limit  of  the  integral  to  infinity.  After  changing  the 
variables so that 
 

τ ′= − , we obtain

(1.12) 

The  integral  in  the  expression  (1.12)  is  a  superoperator-valued  Fourier  transform  over 
ijg τ . While it may be technically difficult 
positive times of the correlation functions 
to compute, all the fundamental difficulties have now been eliminated. To account for a 
finite  lattice  temperature,  and  therefore  a  non-zero  equilibrium  state,  we  must

the full quantum mechanical treatment of the lattice [7], which is outside the scope of 
this thesis. Since the equilibrium density matrix commutes with the static Hamiltonian, 
we also insert it into the first commutator on the right hand side to make the expression

The optional last step in the derivation is to translate this system of equations into the 
equations  for  the  physical  observables  using  any  convenient  operator  basis  set.  The 
choice  of  the  basis  is  a  question  of  taste,  but  there  are  a  few  which  are  particularly

in which the analytical expressions for the coefficients are usually rather complicated, 
especially for systems with multiple cross-correlations [14]. The reader may notice that 
by allowing for an arbitrary basis set in the operator expansion of the density matrix we 
implicitly  allow  complex  observables.  Philosophers  of  science  might  be  annoyed,  but 
complex-valued  observables  (e.g.  transverse  magnetization  corresponding  to  non-
Hermitian  ˆI±  operators) make perfect sense in NMR. 
 
1.1.2 Relaxation and cross-relaxation caused by magnetic dipole interaction 

The  magnetic  dipole-dipole  interaction1  is  the  most  ubiquitous  relaxation-
inducing mechanism in magnetic resonance of spin-½  systems, both diamagnetic and 
paramagnetic. In the diamagnetic case, nuclear relaxation is caused by translational and

be considering electric dipolar interaction anywhere in this Thesis.

rotational  modulation  of  the  inter-nuclear  dipolar  interaction.  In  paramagnetic 
molecules,  nuclear  and  electron  relaxation  occur  largely  due  to  electron-nucleus  and 
inter-electron dipolar interactions. 
 

is  electron-nuclear  cross-relaxation, 

The phenomenon of inter-nuclear dipolar cross-relaxation is usually referred to 
as  the  Nuclear  Overhauser  Effect  (NOE)  even  though  the  original  work  by  Albert 
Overhauser  considered  an  electron-nucleus  system  [19].  The  genuine  Overhauser 
Effect,  which 
is  called  Dynamic  Nuclear 
Polarization  (DNP).  DNP  is  caused  by  the  modulation  not  only  of  the  dipolar 
interaction, but also of the electron-nucleus contact interaction. Both NOE and DNP are 
exploited  in  modern  NMR  spectroscopy:  NOE  is  one  of  the  cornerstones  of  NMR 
structure  elucidation  [20]  and  the  almost  forgotten  DNP  has  recently  been  dusted  off 
and used for NMR sample pre-polarization [21]. 
 

We start by considering nuclear paramagnetic relaxation arising from electron-
nucleus interactions. There are two principal magnetic interactions between an unpaired 
electron and a nucleus: contact and dipolar [22]. Both have a common origin – electron-
nuclear  dipolar  interaction:  the  isotropic  contact  term  reflects  the  interaction  at  close 
distances where the finite size of the nucleus is important, and the anisotropic traceless 
dipolar  term  arises  from  the  (effectively  point  dipole)  electron-nucleus  interaction  at 
large distances. 
 

To be a cause of spin relaxation, an interaction has to be modulated with a non-
zero  fluctuation  spectral  power  density  at  the  Zeeman  frequency.  For  rigid  molecules 
the contribution to relaxation from the contact mechanism is negligibly small, because 
the modulation frequency lies in the infra-red. The dipolar mechanism, on the contrary, 
is nearly always active, because the dipolar interaction tensor is aligned with molecular 
structure and the interaction is modulated at the rate of molecular rotational diffusion. 
The latter has a timescale of nanoseconds and usually has some spectral density at NMR 
and  EPR  transition  frequencies.  The  anisotropic  electron-nuclear  dipole  interaction  is 
therefore  one  of  the  dominant  interactions  determining  spin  relaxation  rates  in 
conformationally rigid radicals [4]. 
 

The energy of interaction between two classical point magnetic dipoles 
 is given by a well-known relation [22]

in which the first two terms describe electron and nuclear Zeeman interaction with the 
magnetic  induction  applied,  as  usual,  along  Z-axis  of  the  laboratory  frame,  and  the 
dipolar  interaction  explicitly  split  into  the  isotropic  and  anisotropic  parts.  The 
anisotropic  part  of  the  electron-nucleus  dipolar  interaction  is  a  traceless  second  rank 
tensor that acts as an operator in a spin space and at the same time transforms according 
l =  irreducible representation of the SU(2) group2 under molecular rotation in a 
to the 
Cartesian space [23]. The evaluation of the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates becomes 
particularly simple if we choose to exploit the properties of SU(2).  
 
 
Any tensor may be decomposed into a linear combination of the special type of 
tensors that have ordered rotation properties – the irreducible spherical tensors, so called 
because  they  form  irreducible  representations  of  SU(2)  [12].  The  irreducible  spherical 
tensor operators for a single spin ½ are:

The  characteristic  decay  time  appearing  in  the  autocorrelation  function  is  called  the

The derivation outlined above considers a general (non-zero rhombicity) case of 
dipolar  interaction  tensor.  In  the  inter-nuclear  case,  the  dipolar  interaction  may  be 
considered to originate from point-dipoles to a very high accuracy. The rhombicity of 
such an interaction is zero. The role of scalar interaction part is played by J-coupling3, 
which  is  always  very  small  compared  to  the  nuclear  Zeeman  frequency.  In  the  inter-
nuclear case equation (1.26) transforms into:

These  expressions  for  the  dipolar  auto-  and  cross-relaxation  rates  are  quoted  without 
derivation  in  quite  a  few  books  [24,  25].  The  enclosed  DVD  contains  a  Mathematica 
program that performs the rather bulky analytical derivation. 
 
The  third  and  a  much  less  common  type of dipolar relaxation is caused by the 
 
rotational  and  translational  modulation  of  the  zero-field  splitting.  It  is  specific  to  the 
systems  containing  more  than  one  unpaired  electron  and  originates  from  the  inter-
electron  dipolar  interaction.  In  the  case  of  a  radical  pair,  not  only angles,  but  also  the 
inter-electron distance is a stochastic function of time. Therefore the expressions for the 
correlation  functions  are  usually  more  complicated  than  either  simple  exponentials  or 
Lipari-Szabo biexponentials [16, 26]. The ZFS mechanism is only operational in long-

therefore may be considered isotropic to a very high accuracy.

systems  will  not  be  encountered  in  the  present  thesis,  and  the  interested  reader  is 
therefore referred to the original papers on the matter [27-29].  
 
1.1.3 Relaxation caused by rotational modulation of the Zeeman interaction 

The nuclear and electron Zeeman interaction anisotropy, that is, the orientation 
dependence  of  the  spin  energy  level  splitting  in  an  external  magnetic  field,  is  another 
common  cause  of  spin  relaxation  in  both  radicals  and  neutral  molecules.  The  electron  
g-tensor  acquires  its  orientation  dependence  predominantly  from  the  spin-orbit 
coupling,  because  the  orbital  contribution  to  the  electron  magnetic  moment  is 
anisotropic [30], and the nuclear magnetic shielding essentially inherits the symmetry of 
the surrounding electron shell [31]. 

 
Before  embarking  on  the  relaxation  analysis,  a  few  more  words  must  be  said 
about  the  chemical  shift  tensor.  The  theoretical  explanation  of  the  phenomenon  of 
chemical shift as a partial magnetic screening of a nucleus by its surrounding electrons 
was given as early as 1950 by Ramsey [31-33], who considered the chemical shift of the 
nuclear  precession  frequency  to  be  an  annoying  small  correction  term  arising  in  the 
measurements  of  nuclear  magnetic  moments.  He  developed  the  theoretical  framework 
necessary to compute the chemical shifts, but the actual calculation proved challenging 
for  multi-atomic  systems,  and  it  was  not  until  around  1990  that  robust  and 
computationally  feasible  methods  started  to  emerge  [34].    Adequate  computing  power 
was reached by common desktop computers in around the year 2000. In this work we 
use  ab  initio  chemical  shift  tensor  computation  to  complement  experimental 
measurements. As of present, solid state NMR results and calculations based on X-ray 
diffraction data are still much more accurate [35]. 

 
In  the  vast  majority  of  cases  the  chemical  shift  tensor  is  strongly  anisotropic, 
even for protons. The typical anisotropy of the proton chemical shift is a few ppm, and 
in the case of 15N or 19F nuclei it can reach hundreds of ppm and starts to play a major 
role in determining the relaxation behaviour of the spin system. A particular case of the 
influence  of  chemical  shielding  anisotropy  (CSA)  on  nuclear  relaxation  which  is 
relevant to the present work is briefly outlined below. 

 

The  Hamiltonian  for  a  single  spin-½  with  an  anisotropic  Zeeman  interaction 
0H , corresponding to either 
 resulting from the 

with the external magnetic field contains the constant term 
the g-factor or the chemical shift, and the time-dependent term 
rotational modulation of the anisotropy:

The  axiality  and  rhombicity  parameters  are  defined  in  the  same  way  as  in  (1.25),  but 
now refer to the Zeeman interaction tensor. Because the magnetic field is assumed to be

It is worth noting that the frequency-independent term in the transverse relaxation rate is 
the  chief  cause  of  the  sensitivity  and  line  width  problems  that  NMR  spectroscopy 
encounters for large molecules. The chemical shielding anisotropy of 13C and 15N nuclei 
is  of  the  order  of  100  ppm,  and  for  the  molecules  with  rotational  correlation  times 
greater  than  about  50  ns  the  transverse  relaxation  becomes  extremely  fast,  leading  to 
intractably broad lines and huge magnetization losses during coherence transfer stages. 
 
1.1.4 Cross-correlated relaxation 
One of the less apparent features of NMR relaxation theory as applied to rigid or 
 
conformationally restricted molecules is the fact that molecular rotation does not drive 
all correlation functions to zero. In fact, in a tumbling rigid molecule all the interaction 
tensors  keep  constant  orientation  with  respect  to  one  another,  which  means  that  the 
orientational  functions  for  the  corresponding  interactions  may  not  be  averaged 
independently. 
 
 
Although the proper theoretical groundwork has been laid a long time ago [36], 
cross-correlated relaxation is a current fashion in biomolecular NMR [37]. The reason is 
that  progressively  more  accurate  NMR  structures  are  required,  and  spectroscopists 
gradually  run  out  of  experimental  constraints  on  molecular  geometry,  which  were 
traditionally  obtained  from  scalar  couplings  and  nuclear  Overhauser  effects.  Cross-

correlated  relaxation  data  provide  a  wealth  of  additional  orientational  constraints,  and 
pulse sequences harvesting them are now in active development [38-40]. 
 
 
Let  us  consider  a  nuclear  two-spin  system  with  a  magnetic  dipolar  interaction 
between the spins and an axially anisotropic  magnetic  shielding  of  one  of  the  nuclei4.

for the S spin and point dipole interaction between the spins, can be written as follows

These  SI  units  expressions  for  the  relaxation  rates  are  remarkable  for  their 
absence in the classical literature. This is partly due to the ever ongoing transition from 
the CGS units beloved by theorists to SI units in which current university courses are 
taught.  This  creates  a  fair  deal  of  confusion,  and  after  some  unsuccessful  attempts  to 
develop  a  unit  conversion  system,  the  author  concluded  that  it  is  simpler  to  just  re-
derive the expressions from scratch. 
 

We  will  not  consider  a  general  multi-spin  system  here.  Although  the 
corresponding expressions are straightforward to derive, they are far too cumbersome to 
be  reported  here.  Readers  requiring  relaxation  rate  expressions  for  systems  with 
multiple dipolar interactions and multiple chemical shift anisotropies will probably find 
the enclosed Mathematica program useful as a starting point. 
 
 
1.2 Origins of the photo-CIDNP effect 
 

CIDNP  (Chemically  Induced  Dynamic  Nuclear  Polarization)  is  defined  by 
IUPAC [1] as a Non-Boltzmann nuclear spin state distribution produced in thermal or 
photochemical reactions, usually from colligation and diffusion, or disproportionation 
of  radical  pairs,  and  detected  by  NMR  spectroscopy  by  enhanced  absorption  or 
emission  signals.  Detected  as  enhanced  absorptive  or  emissive  signals  in  the  NMR 

14  

Chapter 1. Theoretical framework. 
 
spectra  of  the  reaction  products,  CIDNP  has  been  exploited  for  the  last  30  years  to 
characterise transient free radicals and their reaction mechanisms [41, 42]. The theory of 
CIDNP  is  well  developed  and  allows  extraction  of  radical  reaction  rate  constants, 
hyperfine  couplings,  g-values  and  nuclear  paramagnetic  relaxation  rates  [43,  44].  In 
certain  cases,  CIDNP  also  offers  the  possibility  of  large  improvements  in  NMR 
sensitivity.  The  principal  application  of  this  photo-CIDNP  technique,  as  devised  by 
Kaptein  in  1978  [45],  has  been  to  proteins  in  which  the  aromatic  amino  acid  residues 
histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine can be polarized using flavins or other aza-aromatics 
as  photosensitizers  [46,  47].  The  key  feature  of  the  method  is  that  only  solvent-
accessible  histidine,  tryptophan  and  tyrosine  residues  can  undergo  the  radical  pair 
reactions that result in nuclear polarization. Photo-CIDNP has thus been used to probe 
the  surface  structure  of  proteins,  both  in  native  and  partially  folded  states,  and  their 
interactions with molecules that modify the accessibility of the reactive side chains [46-
50]. 
Photo-CIDNP  experiments  on  proteins  using  an  argon  ion  laser  as  the  light 
source  and  flavin  mononucleotide  (FMN)  as  the  photosensitizer  routinely  exhibit  1H 
NMR signal enhancements of up to 10-fold. Heavier spin-½ nuclei (13C, 15N, 19F) often 
show larger polarizations [48, 51]. A 10-100 fold  19F hyperpolarization can be created 
and sustained for several seconds in photo-CIDNP experiments on fluorinated aromatic 
systems [52]. 

 

Figure  1.1.  The  scheme  of  sensitized  photolysis  of  the  donor  molecule  A  with  the 
photosensitizer F. The photosensitizer molecule is excited by a photon of the incident light 
and  undergoes  intersystem  crossing  into  the  triplet  state,  which  is  a  very  strong  electron 
acceptor. On encounter with the target molecule A the electron transfer occurs, forming a 
triplet  spin-correlated  radical  pair.  The  intersystem  crossing  in  this  radical  pair  is  nuclear 
spin  dependent  through  the  mechanism  outlined  in  the  text,  resulting  in  the  nuclear  spin 
sorting  during  recombination/separation  processes.  The  upper  left  indices  indicate  spin 
multiplicity.

We shall limit our consideration of the CIDNP effect to the simplest case of a 
“strong”  external  magnetic  field,  i.e.  when  the  electron  Zeeman  interaction  in  the 
intermediate radicals is much stronger than the hyperfine interaction. The reason for this 
is twofold: the fact that the strong field case is the only case encountered in this work, 
and the present state of the low-field CIDNP theory, which in its current formulation is 
hardly adequate, and is computationally prohibitive for real-life systems [53, 54]. 
 
 
The  generation  of  CIDNP  in  the  systems  considered  in  this  work  is  a  cyclic 
photochemical  process  shown  schematically  in  Figure  1.1.  The  chain  of  reactions  is 
initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide photosensitizer 
*ππ →   singlet  excited  state.  The  fluorescence  quantum  yield  of  this  state  is 
to  the 
rather low [55], and approximately half of the molecules undergo intersystem crossing 
into  the  long-lived  triplet  state.  Triplet  flavin  has  a  remarkable  electron  affinity:  364 
kJ/mol,  or  3.77  eV  [56].  If  a  molecule  with  a  low  ionization  potential  (e.g.  phenols, 
polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction 
forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics 
are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH 
dependence [57, 58]. 
 

The  radical  pair  may  either  cross  over  to  a  singlet  electron  state  and  then 
recombine, or separate and perish in side reactions. The relative probability of these two 
pathways for a given radical pair depends on the nuclear spin state via the mechanism 
outlined  below.  Nuclear  magnetization  generation  in  the  strong  field  case  may 
conveniently  be  illustrated  using  the  Schrödinger  equation  rather  than  the  more 
powerful  density  matrix  formalism5.  We  start  from  the  Schrödinger  equation  for  the 
spin part of the wave function

and  assume  that  the  two  molecules  are  already  sufficiently  far  apart  that  the  inter-
electron  exchange  interaction  is  negligibly  small.  The  spin  part  of  the  system 
Hamiltonian is then decoupled from the spatial part and may be written as

from the singlet state, so we must expect a certain amount of nuclear spin selection in 
the reaction products. Molecules with a favourable nuclear spin state configuration have 
a greater chance of recombination and yielding neutral molecules, especially when the 
difference in g-factors is small. The radical pairs that diffuse apart have the polarisation 
of  opposite  sign,  but  that  one  partially  vanishes  due  to  fast  paramagnetic  relaxation. 
Thus, after all the radicals in the system have disappeared (a few milliseconds after the 
excitation  flash),  only  neutral  molecules  with  nuclear  spin  states  perturbed  from  the 
equilibrium  remain.  Including  anisotropies  in  the  discussion  above  will  introduce  an 
orientation  dependence  of  the  reaction  yield.  This  orientation  dependence  is  now 
believed to be a possible mechanism responsible for the magnetic field direction sense 
in some biological species [59]. 
 

Based on equation (1.48) for the speed of the singlet-triplet interconversion, a set 
of rules may be formulated for prediction of the sign of the net CIDNP effect on a given 
nucleus  (the  Kaptein  rules  [60]).  For  the  case  of  the  dye-sensitized  photo-CIDNP 
experiment

iA  is the hyperfine coupling constant of the nucleus in

question.  These  rules  (and  similar  rules  for  multiplet  CIDNP)  should  be  treated  with 
caution, as they are only obeyed by a rather narrow range of CHNO molecules, and are 
fairly  often  violated  for  systems  containing  heavier  atoms,  as  will  be  demonstrated  in 
Chapters 5-8. 
 
 
1.3 Secondary radial kinetics in the photo-CIDNP generation 
 

After  the  geminate  spin-sorting  process  is  complete,  those  radicals  that  have 
escaped  the  primary  cage  recombination  engage  in  secondary  reactions  leading  to 
further  change  in  the  overall  nuclear  magnetization.  The  particular  case  of  dye-
sensitized  pulsed  photo-CIDNP  experiment  has  been  treated  by  Vollenweider  and

These equations resemble kinetic equations for the radical concentrations, but have been 
modified  to  describe  dynamics  of  magnetization  rather  concentration  [44].  The  first

something that is useful in practice and applicable to systems where the electron transfer 
stage is followed by rapid deprotonation (e.g. phenols and tyrosine). With some effort 
the solution may be obtained in a closed algebraic form

the  evaluation  rather  slow.  The  brute  force  numerical  solution  (adaptive  fourth  order

squares  inverse  problems  where  a  minimizer  normally  requires  a  few  thousand  error 
function  evaluations  to  converge  to  a  desired  accuracy.  Some  approximations  are 
therefore required, if not to obtain an exact match, then to approximately locate a least 
squares minimum to save time on full minimization. One simple approach would be to 
attempt solving (1.50) in power series around

Another,  and  a  more  successful  approach  is  to  use  a  Padé  approximant  around 
t = . The (1,2) approximant generally looks similar to the target function, but has an 
1t −   asymptotic  behaviour;  the  (2,3)  approximant  is  unsatisfactory  for  small 
incorrect 
times and has the same erroneous asymptote; the (3,2) approximant expectedly diverges 
at  t → ∞ ;  the  (2,2)  approximant  reproduces  all  the  essential  features  of  the  function, 
being  off  by  ~10%,  mostly  in  the  asymptotic  region;  the  (3,3)  approximant  is  rather 
good,  with  a  relative  error  of  less  than  5%.  More  accurate  higher  order  approximants 
such  as  (4,4)  are  notationally  bulky,  but  are  still  a  lot  faster  than  both  analytical  and 
numerical solution of (1.50). 
 

The (4,4) Padé approximant, which was used for initial least squares minimum 
location,  provides  very  satisfactory  results  with  the  approximation  inaccuracy  of  less 
than  3%  within  the  operational  interval  and  five  orders  of  magnitude  speed-up 
compared  to  numerical  ODE  solution.  Its  full  expression  is  too  cumbersome  to  be 
reported  here,  the  reader  will  find  it  inside  the  ik_fit.m  program  on  the  enclosed 
DVD. 

 
Finally,  the  case  when  both  relaxation  and  degenerate  exchange  are  present, 

yields a solution of the following form:

19F nucleus: exploratory 
calculations and photo-
CIDNP experiments 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
2.1 Introduction 

T 

 
he purpose of the experiments and calculations described in this Chapter is to 
get a general idea of the magnitude, properties and potential applications of 
19F photo-CIDNP and secondary effects, specifically of CIDNP-pumped  19F-

1H dipolar cross-relaxation. Specific questions answered herein are: 

 
What  are  the  essential  conditions  that  the  reaction  system  must  meet  to  be 
informative and useful in 19F photo-CIDNP experiments?  
 
What  is  the  best  available  reaction  system  for  application  of  19F  CIDNP  to 
proteins, considering cost, effect magnitude and photostability? 
 
How  many  of  the  essential  photo-CIDNP  system  parameters  may  be  computed 
ab initio and what is the accuracy of such computations? 
 
Can a simple extension of Redfield’s relaxation theory [7, 9] be constructed for 
describing CW photo-CIDNP pumped nuclear spin systems? 
 
The prior work on the 19F CIDNP effect is very sparse and can be condensed to 
two facts. One is that  19F CIDNP is extremely strong, typically about five times larger 
than  the  1H  CIDNP  effect  in  the  same  position  of  the  same  molecule  [51,  62,  63], 
primarily due to larger hyperfine couplings in the intermediate radicals. The second is 
that  the  19F  CIDNP  effect  often  disobeys  Kaptein’s  rules  [60]  and  has  been  shown  to 
have  a  strong  contribution  from  electron-nuclear  cross-relaxation  and/or  other 
relaxation-related processes [64-69].  

24  

Chapter 2. 19F nucleus: exploratory calculations and photo-CIDNP experiments. 
 
The work described in this Chapter uses ab initio quantum chemical calculations 
essentially  as  a  method  of  investigation  equal  in  most  respects  to  the  experimental 
practice. Provided that due care is taken, the “in silico experiment” constitutes a faithful 
representation  of  reality  and  can  be  thought  of  as  a  pocket  Universe.  The  systematic 
searches  performed  in  recent  years  have  uncovered  robust  and  reliable  recipes  for 
calculation of just about any molecular property, provided the molecule is sufficiently 
small  to  make  the  calculation  affordable  [70,  71].  As  one  of  my  colleagues  put  it: 
“Quantum chemistry has made some truly spectacular advances. You can actually trust 
it now.” 
 
 
The  simplest  fluorinated  aromatic  compounds  that  have  an  ionisation  potential 
low  enough  to  engage  in  an  electron  transfer  with  a  photosensitizer  triplet  are 
fluorophenols.  These  compounds  are  cheap,  water-soluble,  and  do  not  have  titration 
points  around  neutral  pH.  Parafluorophenol  also  has  four  important  tensors  aligned  to 
the same eigenframe: diffusion, 19F CSA, 19F HFC and g-tensor. The small size and the 
flat  geometry  of  the  intermediate  radicals  (CS  symmetry  for  2-  and  3-fluorophenoxyl, 
C2V symmetry for 4-fluorophenoxyl) also makes them a convenient target for ab initio 
calculation of molecular properties. The three isomeric fluorophenols (Figure 2.1) were 
therefore  chosen  as  test  compounds  for  initial  evaluation  and  reconnaissance 
experiments.

The  reader  will  probably  remember  that at  the  dawn  of  the  XXI  century  every 
research work in natural sciences, from mathematical all the way down to philosophical, 
had  either  to  claim  a  biological  application,  or  face  no  chance  of  ever  being  funded. 
Most  fortunately,  as  outlined  in  Section  1.3,  the  photo-CIDNP  effect  has  such  an 
application, and is used with some success for investigation of protein surface dynamics 
during  folding  or  state  change  processes  [49,  72].  Introducing  the  fluorine  nucleus  in 
biomolecules  has  also  proved  to  be  remarkably  informative,  mostly  due  to  the  large 
chemical shift dispersion of the 19F nucleus and the sensitivity of the fluorine chemical 
shift to the changes in the molecular environment [51, 73]. The combination of the two 
techniques,  that  is,  19F  photo-CIDNP  of  fluorine-labelled  proteins  is  evaluated  in  this 
Thesis. Because fluorinated proteins are not available commercially and rather difficult 
to make, it seems reasonable in reconnaissance experiments to try out individual amino 
acids first.

Of  the  three  natural  amino  acids  that  are  known  to  exhibit  detectable  photo-
CIDNP  polarization  (Tyr,  Trp,  His),  histidine  is  unlikely  to  be  a  good  target  for 
fluorination  because  of  the  relatively  slow  electron  transfer  to  photosensitizer  and 
consequently weak polarization [57], as well as unfavourable competition effects from 
tyrosine  and  tryptophan  [57,  74].  Only  tyrosine  and  tryptophan  therefore  need  to  be 
considered.  Excluding  optical  isomers,  there  are  seven  possible  positions  of  single 
fluorination  in  the  tryptophan  amino  acid  and  four  in  the  tyrosine.  In  the  resulting  11 
molecules the observed CIDNP amplitude and sensitivity will depend primarily on the 
19F hyperfine coupling constant in the intermediate radical (neutral phenoxyl radical in 
the case of tyrosine and molecular cation radical in the case of tryptophan).

All  isomers  of  fluorotyrosine  and  fluorotryptophans  are  sufficiently  small  to 
 
enable a high quality ab initio calculation of molecular properties. Should the ab initio 
results appear promising, all of these compounds are also either commercially available 
or straightforward to synthesize. 
 
 
2.2 Experimental details 
 
The  reagents  were  used  as  received  from  Apollo  Scientific  (D2O),  Lancaster 
 
(fluorophenols, 3-fluorotyrosine) and Sigma-Aldrich (fluorotryptophans, FMN). 19F and 
1H NMR spectra were recorded either on a home-built 600 MHz NMR spectrometer, or 
on a Varian Inova 600 NMR system. In all experiments the NMR sample contained 4.0 
mM target compound (fluorophenol,  fluorotyrosine or fluorotryptophan) and 0.20 mM 
FMN  photosensitizer  in  D2O  at  pH  5.0  (uncorrected  for  deuterium  isotope  effect)  at 
25.0 °C. Unless otherwise stated, all NMR and photo-CIDNP spectra were recorded in 
one scan with sufficient sweep width to incorporate all signals without reflections. The 
acquisition time in all cases was set to longer than five times the reciprocal width of the 
narrowest  signal.  The  hardware  oversampling  rate  was  in  all  cases  set  to  the 
instrumental  maximum.  All  FIDs  were  weighted  by  an  exponential  or  a  Gaussian 
pseudoecho window function matched to the narrowest peak and zero filled to twice the 
original length prior to the Fourier transformation.

Our  continuous-wave  photo-
CIDNP setup (assembled jointly by the 
author  and  Dr.  Iain  Day)  utilizes  a 
Spectra-Physics  BeamLok  2080  argon 
ion  laser,  operating  in  either  a  single-
line  (488  nm)  or  a  multi-line  (princi-
pally  at  488  and  514  nm)  mode,  with 
25  W  maximum  output  power.  A  me-
the 
chanical  shutter  controlled  by 
spectrometer  is  used  to  produce  light 
pulses  of  10-104  ms  duration.  The 
Newport  M-5X  objective  lens  is  used 
to  focus  the  light  into  a  6  m  length  of 
Newport F-MBE optical fibre ( ≥ 70% 
transmission  efficiency),  which  trans-
mits the light to the SMA connector at 
the platform mounted to the ceiling be-
side  the  spectrometer  magnet.  The  op-
tical  fibre  attached  to  the  other  end  of 
the  SMA  connector  then  routes  the 
light  inside  the  magnet  to  the  NMR 
sample  assembly,  which  is  shown  schematically  in  Figure  2.3.  The  optical  fibre  is 
housed  inside  a  Wilmad  WGS-5BL  coaxial  insert.  This  sample  illumination  system, 
first suggested by Scheffler et al. [75], is very robust and convenient to use, provided 
that the sample optical density is below ~2 (dense samples are dealt with in Chapter 4).

In  each  CIDNP  experiment  the  sample  solution  was  purged  with  argon  for  30 
minutes  prior  to  loading  into  the  air-tight  re-injection  refreshing  system,  comprising  a 
syringe  linked  to  the  sample  refresh  tube  (Figure  2.3).  A  spectrometer-controlled 
stepper motor moves the syringe plunger so as to mix the solution contained in the coil 
region  with  the  layers  above  and  below  it,  as  well  as  with  about  3  ml  of  the  sample 
contained in the syringe. The sample solution was thus remixed after each scan, and the 
samples were replaced as necessary to keep photosensitizer degradation below 10%.

A typical continuous-wave photo-CIDNP experiment is schematically shown in 
Figure 2.4. The laser flash of 10 ms to 10 s duration is followed by an optional mixing 
time,  after  which  a  90-degrees  pulse  makes  the  magnetization  observable.  After  a 
relaxation  delay  (with  optional  sample  refreshment)  a  “dark”  spectrum  is  recorded  to 
serve as a signal intensity and position reference. In the case of very crowded spectra, 
such  as  those  of  proteins,  the  “dark”  spectrum  can  be  subtracted  from  the  illuminated 
spectrum  so  as  to  leave  just  the  signals  whose  intensity  is  perturbed  by  the  photo-
CIDNP effect. 
 
 
2.3 Computational details 
 

The  ab  initio  calculations  were  performed  using  Gaussian03  [76],  GAMESS 
[77] or DALTON [78] running either on local workstations (Intel Pentium 4 Northwood 
3.0 GHz / 2 GB DDR400 2.5-3-3-6 / Linux) or on the Sun Fire 6800 shared memory 
system  installed  at  Oxford  Supercomputing  Centre.  When  running  on  the  latter,  6-12 
CPUs  were  normally  used  together  with  15-20  GB  of  RAM.  Gaussian03  was  run  in 
either single-CPU (workstation) or SHMEM parallel (supercomputer) mode, GAMESS 
and  DALTON  were  either  run  on  a  single  CPU  or  in  parallel  using  either  built-in 
TCP/IP  DDI  interface  (GAMESS)  or  MPI  parallel  environment  (DALTON).  A  local 
Gigabit network was assembled to run independently of the departmental network and 
provide interlink for GAMESS and DALTON parallel runs on local workstations. 
 

The  first  approximation  for  the  geometry  optimization  runs  was  obtained  with 
unrestricted PM3 runs to save CPU time on subsequent DFT optimization. The accurate 
geometry  optimization  was  normally  performed  with  restricted  (if  necessary,  open-
shell) DFT method using B3LYP exchange-correlation functional in a 6-311++G(2d,2p) 
basis  set  either  in  vacuum  or  in  a  PCM  solvent.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  property 
calculations  were  performed  in  vacuum  or  PCM  solvent  using:  unrestricted  DFT 
B3LYP in an EPR-III basis set for hyperfine coupling tensors, unrestricted GIAO DFT 
B3LYP using EPR-III basis set for g-tensors, unrestricted GIAO DFT or HF methods in 
a  6-311++G(2d,2p)  basis  for  chemical  shielding  tensors.  The  tolerance  for  SCF 
convergence for single-point property runs and at every geometry optimization iteration 
was  set  to:  10−9  (energy),  10−6  (max  density  matrix),  10−8  (RMS  density  matrix).  The 
geometry  convergence  tolerance  was  set  to:  4.5×10−4  (max  force),  3.0×10−4  (RMS 
force),  1.8×10−3  (max  displacement),  1.2×10−3  (RMS  displacement)  for  PCM 
optimizations  and  to  1.5×10−5  (max  force),  1.0×10−5  (RMS  force),  6.0×10−5  (max 
displacement), 4.0×10−5 (RMS displacement) for vacuum optimizations.  
 
A  program  was  written  in  Matlab  7.0  to  parse  Gaussian  98/03  single-point 
 
output  and  draw  visual  representations  of  hyperfine  tensors  using  3D  ellipsoid  plots. 
The version current at the time of writing can be found on the enclosed DVD, the most

recent one is likely to be available from Matlab Central. Every ellipsoid is drawn in the 
following way:

2.  A  set  of  axes  is  drawn  inside  the  sphere  with  red  axis  for  positive 

eigenvalues and blue for negative ones. 

3.  The sphere is translated to the point of corresponding atom and rotated into 

the molecular frame.

There  certainly  is  a  more  mathematically  consistent  way  of  representing  the 
anisotropy  of  a  tensor,  that  is,  when  for  negative  eigenvalues  the  ellipsoid  is  actually 
pulled inside out through zero and the resulting plot looks like (and may be shown to be 
mY θϕ   spherical  harmonics.  It  was 
related  to,  see  Chapter  1)  a  superposition  of 
found  however,  that  with  this  faithful  representation  the  picture  gets  cluttered  and  far 
less easy to comprehend. Since the hyperfine tensor itself operates in a direct product of 
two four-dimensional spin spaces, which fundamentally have no classical analogue, the 
details of its representation in Cartesian space are a matter of convenience.  
 
 
2.4 Ab initio  hyperfine coupling constants 
 
2.4.1 General notes 
 
The  electron-nucleus  dipolar  interaction  that  gives  rise  to  hyperfine  coupling 
naturally  falls  into  two  categories:  the  anisotropic  part  corresponding  to  pure  dipolar 
interaction  between  electron  and  nucleus  at  large  separations  and  the  isotropic  part 
resulting from a short-range dipolar interaction and stemming from the fact that because 
of finite size of the nucleus, the spherical average of point-to-point dipolar interaction is 
not  zero.  Because  this  second  part  results  from  short-range  interactions,  it  is  often 
referred to as contact interaction [22]. 
 

The  expression  for  the  anisotropic  part  of  hyperfine  coupling  involves  an 
integral over the spatial distribution of the unpaired electron, which is relatively easy to 
compute  accurately  even  at  a  relatively  low  level  of  theory  [79].  The  contact  term, 
however,  includes  a  delta-function  that  chips  out  the  wave  function  amplitude  at  the 
nucleus  point.  The  latter  is  quite  difficult  to  compute  both  because  standard  Gaussian 
basis  sets  do  not  reproduce  the  wave  function  cusp  at  the  nucleus  point  and  because

29 
 
additional flexibility has to be introduced into the core part of the basis to account for 
the now essential core-valence interaction [80]. 
 

The basis sets and methods adequate for computing contact hyperfine couplings 
are  relatively  recent;  the  best  general-purpose  methods  (DFT  B3LYP  with  EPR-II  or 
EPR-III basis set) were introduced in 1995 [81] and 1996 [82]. EPR-II is a double-ζ and 
EPR-III a triple-ζ basis set augmented by polarization and diffuse functions with core s-
type Gaussians uncontracted and a number of tight s-type functions added. Furthermore, 
contraction coefficients were specifically optimized to reproduce experimental isotropic 
hyperfine  couplings  in  a  standard  set  of  molecules.  Notably  the  basis  sets  have  been 
optimized  for  computing  hyperfine  couplings  specifically  with  B3LYP  exchange-
correlation  functional,  and  an  attempt  to  use  a  different  functional,  even  a  fairly  good 
one like B3PW91 or PBE1PBE, usually leads to poorly predicted contact interactions. 
The anisotropic components however are always satisfactory. 

 
The important aspect of ab initio hyperfine coupling calculations is the variation 
of  this  parameter  during  molecular  vibrations.  In  the  paper  that  introduces  the  EPR-II 
and  EPR-III  basis  sets,  Barone  and  co-workers  show  that  the  equilibrium  geometry 
calculation  of  hyperfine  couplings  underestimates  the  large  couplings,  which  are 
rectified after taking a vibrational average [82]. The practical difficulties of performing 
this averaging even for medium-sized molecules are however formidable, with a need to 
compute a Hessian to perform even the simplest vibrational average. Even though the 
code performing this procedure was available to the author, the necessary calculations 
were well out of reach of even the SunFire 6800 supercomputer, with the result that the 
larger of the computed hyperfine couplings in the tables reported below are noticeably 
smaller than the experimental values. Annoying as these small deviations might be, the 
estimates obtained at the equilibrium geometry are still very reliable [83].  
 
2.4.2 The role of the solvent interactions 
While it is quite clear from a large volume of literature on the subject that the 
 
DFT  U-B3LYP  /  EPR-III  method  will  provide  reliable  hyperfine  couplings  [83],  the 
account  of  the  solvent  interactions  is  a  more  ambiguous  question.  A  small  additional 
inquiry  has  been  made  below  into  the  solvent  electrostatic  effect  on  the  computed 
hyperfine  couplings.  This  benchmarking  was  performed  on  4-fluorophenoxyl  because 
of its high symmetry and therefore relatively short calculation times. 
 

Two  DFT  B3LYP  6-311++G(2d,2p)/EPR-III  calculations,  one  in  vacuum  and 
the other in PCM water were performed with the purpose of assessing the importance of 
solvent  electrostatic  effects  in  HFC  calculations  of  fluorinated  aromatic  radicals.  The 
results, along with experimental values for isotropic HFCs, are presented in Table 2.1. 
For both protons and fluorine the PCM water HFC values are closer to the experiment

than the vacuum values. Including PCM water in the calculation does not increase the 
computation time, so it was decided to include PCM solvent in all HFC calculations.  

 
The use of PCM water also shifts the hyperfine tensor axiality and rhombicity of 
those atoms which bear strong partial charges, a result of charge compensation by the 
polarized solvent. No experimental data is available on anisotropy parameters of HFC 
tensors in these systems, but the literature data on other molecules and the fact that the 
values  seem  to  have  got  saturated  (see  EPR-III  vs.  aug-cc-pVQZ  comparison  below), 
suggest that these parameters are accurate.

2.4.3 Tight basis functions 

The inadequacy of general-purpose basis sets for computing isotropic hyperfine 
couplings is illustrated on the example of DFT B3LYP 6-311++G(2d,2p)/aug-cc-pVQZ 
calculation.  A  very  large  and  chemically  accurate  aug-cc-pVQZ  basis  set  ideally 
reproduces  the  overall  unpaired  electron  distribution  and  hence  the  anisotropy 
parameters  (which  are  almost  identical  to  EPR-III  data),  but  fails  to  reproduce 
experimental  value  for  19F  contact  coupling.  Because  the  wave  function  cusp  at  the 
nucleus is smoothed out by aug-cc-pVQZ, the resulting isotropic HFCs, especially the 
larger ones, come out wrong by a large margin. 

 
The  experimental  [84]  versus  theoretical  plot  for  the  hyperfine  couplings  in 
fluorophenoxyl  radicals  that  are  experimentally  available  is  shown  on  Figure  2.5.  The 
agreement is quite good, however, as discussed above, the large hyperfine couplings are 
underestimated by the ab initio calculation due to the lack of vibrational averaging.

As a side note, while it is extremely good at computing hyperfine couplings, the 
GIAO  DFT  B3LYP  6-311++G(2d,2p)/EPR-III  method  appears  to  be  inadequate  for 
calculation  the  radical  g-factors,  in  particular  it  is  certainly  not  accurate  enough  to 
distinguish the three isomeric fluorophenoxyl radicals:

The  error  looks  systematic  rather  than  random,  and  is  small  enough  to  permit 
calculation of expected CIDNP intensities if Δg value is larger than about 0.002. 

2.4.4 Sharp hyperfine couplings 

Before  we  proceed  to  take  a  look  at  the  computed  hyperfine  tensors  for 
fluorophenoxyl  radical,  one  other  phenomenon  should  be  discussed,  specifically,  the 
very peculiar shape of many  13C hyperfine coupling tensors in aromatic radicals. In all 
fluorophenoxyl radicals (and also in a large number of other aromatic radicals that were 
computed  at  different  stages  of  the  work  reported  herein)  the  carbons  that  bear 
substantial  p-type  HOMO  density  all  have  very  large  hyperfine  tensor  components 
along  the  eigenaxis  perpendicular  to  the  aromatic  ring  plane  and  almost  zero 
eigenvalues along the axes lying in the ring plane. In other words, these HFC tensors are 
very  stretched  in  one  direction  and  almost  needle-like.  This  peculiar  shape  is  easy  to 
rationalise if we consider a 
dipolar  interaction  tensor 
between  a  nucleus  and  a 
cloud  of  electron  density 
located  above  and  below, 
but  not  around  it  (Figure 
2.4). Evaluating the dipolar 
integral  results  in  a  tensor, 
which  does  indeed  have  a 
very elongated shape in the 
ellipsoid plot.  
 
Beyond just being a 
peculiar 
phenomenon, 
these extremely anisotropic 
HFC  tensors  (depicted  in 
quantities  on  Figures  2.5-

Thesis) are likely to cause strong orientation dependence of recombination probability 
in  the  spatially  ordered  radical  pairs  [59].  This  anisotropy  becomes  even  more  pro-
nounced, if we notice that all such HFC tensors have parallel axes. In a suitably chosen 
molecule this could well result in overall HFC anisotropy of the order of kiloGauss for 
certain nuclear entanglements.

2.4.5 Fluorophenoxyl radicals 
The computed hyperfine coupling tensors for the three fluorophenoxyl radicals 
 
are shown as ellipsoid plots on Figures 2.5-2.8 and reported in Tables 2.2 and 2.3. There 
are several things to note. First of all, to a very high accuracy the 19F HFC tensors in 2-
fluorophenoxyl  and  4-fluorophenoxyl  radicals  are  axial.  This  is  a  pleasant  finding, 
because it results in a substantial simplification to the theoretical treatment further on, 
removing a number of irreducible spherical tensors from the calculation and simplifying 
Wigner rotation matrices in the relaxation theory setup. Second, the isotropic  19F HFC 
of  2-  and  4-fluorophenoxyls  is  extremely  large,  explaining  earlier  findings  that  19F 
photo-CIDNP  effect  is  very  strong.  A  single  dominant  hyperfine  coupling  also  means 
that a single-nucleus radical is likely to be a good approximation for describing photo-
CIDNP  effect  in  these  systems  (the  ab  initio  computation  was  performed  for  the  17O 
isotopomer, but the natural abundance of magnetic isotopes of oxygen is 0.24% [86]) . 
 

Another  notable  finding  is  the  remarkably  high  anisotropy  of  19F  hyperfine 
tensors,  which  is  as  high  as  242  Gauss  in  4-fluorophenoxyl  radical.  Rotational 
modulation  of  hyperfine  interaction  is  the  primary  nuclear  relaxation  mechanism  in 
radicals,  furthermore,  the  relaxation  rate  is  quadratic  in  HFC  anisotropy.  We  should 
therefore expect to find an extremely fast nuclear paramagnetic relaxation, at least for 
some  correlation  times,  and  expect  relaxation  processes  to  play  a  major  role  in  19F 
CIDNP formation. The complicated relaxation channels of the photo-CIDNP effect are 
explored in detail in Chapter 8.

From the ab initio data it looks like 4-fluorophenol with its high symmetry, large 
 
hyperfine coupling and huge HFC anisotropy is a compound of choice for exploring the 
mechanistic and theoretical side of the 19F photo-CIDNP phenomenon.

2.4.6 Fluorotyrosyl radicals 
The  ring-fluorinated  tyrosines  have  been  used  for  a  long  time  in  protein  19F 
 
spectroscopy,  providing  information  on  enzymatic  reaction  mechanisms  [87-89], 
biological 
[94-97]. 
Fluorotyrosines  are  relatively  straightforward  to  incorporate  into  a  protein,  either 
biosynthetically, or using solid phase peptide synthesis. If useful data can be extracted 
from  19F  photo-CIDNP  experiments  in  fluorotyrosines,  the  established  fluorinated 
proteins community should certainly benefit from it.

Chapter 2. 19F nucleus: exploratory calculations and photo-CIDNP experiments. 
 
It is clear from the data presented in Table 2.3 that 2-fluorotyrosine is unlikely to 
be  a  good  target  for  19F  photo-CIDNP  experiments,  owing  to  a  small  hyperfine 
coupling.  Since  2-fluorotyrosine  is  also  considerably  more  difficult  to  synthesize  than 
its 3-fluorinated counterpart, there’s no reason whatsoever to even try 2-fluorotyrosine, 
and the commercially available (and therefore widely used for protein incorporation) 3-
fluorotyrosine will be chosen for the experiments described later in this Thesis.

2.4.7 Fluorotryptophan radicals 
 
The sheer number of possible mono- and polyfluorinated tryptophans, combined 
with  the  typical  cost  of  £1000  per  gram  of  enantiomerically  pure  compound,  clearly 
means  that  ab  initio  evaluation  has  to  be  performed  before  trying  out  the 
fluorotryptophans  experimentally  or  preparing  proteins  labelled  with  them.  The  high-
quality  ab  initio  calculations  of  molecular  geometry  and  hyperfine  couplings  of 
fluorotryptophan are on the brink of the capability of the processing hardware that was 
available  to  the  author.  For  each  of  the  molecules  tabulated  below,  the  full  geometry 
optimization and HFC calculation (see Section 2.3 for details) has taken about 30 days 
of  CPU  time  on  the  SunFire  6800  supercomputer.  With  12  processors  working  in 
parallel  and  20GB  of  RAM  allocated  for  the  two-electron  integral  storage,  the 
calculation took about 60 wall clock hours per molecule, which is acceptable.

Chapter 2. 19F nucleus: exploratory calculations and photo-CIDNP experiments.

Arguably, the molecular geometry for tryptophans could have been computed in 
a  smaller  basis  set  (such  as  6-31G**)  without  introducing  too  much  of  an  error,  but 
given  the  past  controversy  about  the  values  of  the  hyperfine  couplings  in  tryptophan 
radicals and the fact that HFCs are quite sensitive to distortions in molecular geometry, 
the author thought he should take no chances. 

 
In  neutral  and  basic  tryptophan  solutions  the  CIDNP  generation  mechanism 
involves an electron transfer from the tryptophan to the photosensitizer, followed by the 
deprotonation of the cation to form a neutral radical [98]. Depending on the acidity of 
the  medium  the  deprotonation  may  occur  with  different  speeds  or  not  at  all,  meaning 
that  there  are  two  kinds  of  radical  that  can  contribute,  solely  or  in  part,  to  the  photo-
CIDNP generation – neutral radical and cation radical. A test of involvement of cation 
radical in the photo-CIDNP generation on tryptophans may be suggested based on the 
computed hyperfine couplings from Tables 2.4 and 2.5: the hyperfine coupling on F(2) 
in 2-flurotryptophan is close to zero in the neutral radical, whereas the cation radical has 
a  healthy  12  Gauss  of  isotropic  HFC.  If  the  photo-CIDNP  effect  is  observed 
experimentally on either 19F in 2-fluorotryptophan, or H(2) in common tryptophan, this 
is an indication that the spin evolution occurs, to a considerable extent, in a tryptophan 
cation  radical.  The  experimental  data  and  its  implications  are  analyzed  later  in  this 
Chapter. 
 
The  computed  hyperfine  couplings  in  the  intermediate  cation  radicals  lead  to 
several  conclusions.  The  first  is  that  out  of  five  possible  ring-fluorinated  tryptophans, 
only 2-, 4- and 6-fluorinated isomers are feasible for use in  19F photo-CIDNP studies. 
Out of those three, the 19F CIDNP polarization in 2-fluorotryptophan is likely to have a 
strong  pH-dependence  due  to  different  hyperfine  couplings  in  the  neutral  and  cation 
radical.  Sadly,  the  synthetically  most  accessible  (and  therefore  the  cheapest)  5-
fluorotryptophan  appears  useless.  The  second  conclusion  is  that,  just  in  the  case  of 
fluorophenols, the distinctive feature of fluorine is an extremely large HFC anisotropy, 
likely  leading  to  very  fast  nuclear  paramagnetic  relaxation  in  these  radicals.  Lastly, 
although  the  15N  HFC  on  the  aromatic  nitrogen  is  quite  small,  the  relative  15N  photo-
CIDNP enhancement will be rather large because of low equilibrium polarization of 15N 
nuclei. This finding is consistent with experimental observation made by Lyon [63] that 
nitrogen CIDNP polarization in tryptophan/FMN system is approximately two orders of 
magnitude larger than the equilibrium polarization. 
 
2.4.8 Rotational dependence of the hyperfine couplings 
One of the obvious fluorination positions in all CIDNP-active amino acids is a β-
 
CH2 group, featuring large proton hyperfine couplings, at least for some conformations. 
A  CH2  proton  positioned  orthogonally  to  the  aromatic  ring  plane  is  known  to  possess 
hyperfine coupling as large as 28 Gauss in a tryptophan cation [59]. It is expected that 
19F hyperfine coupling in the same position would be at least twice as big, potentially

making  the  CH2  linker  the  best  fluorination  position  from  the  photo-CIDNP  effect 
magnitude  point  of  view.  The  dihedral  angle  dependence  of  19F  hyperfine  coupling  in 
structurally  similar  anion  radicals  (fluorine-substituted  nitrobenzene  derivatives)  has 
been  addressed  experimentally  and  using  early  quantum  chemical  methods  in  1972-
1993 by Polenov [99-101] and in 1990 by Beregovaya [102], who found the expected 
sinusiodal  dependence  of  the  19F  HFC  on  the  dihedral  angle  and  very  large  hyperfine 
couplings for certain values of that angle. Anion radical results, although instructive, are 
of  little  use  for  the  present  work,  in  which  the  target  amino  acid  is  present  in  either 
neutral or cation radical form. A separate calculation was therefore performed to clear 
up the question. 
 

The  correct  analysis  of  19F  hyperfine  couplings  in  β-fluorinated  tyrosine  or 
tryptophan radical requires scanning the dihedral angle corresponding to the CH2 group 
rotation  with  constrained  reoptimization  of  geometry  at  every  step.  The  computation 
time required for accurate calculation of this kind on a whole amino acid is too large, so 
a smaller system was analysed, for which the calculation is affordable. 

 
The  simplest  model  system  for  β-fluorinated  tyrosine  is 
 
parafluoromethylphenoxyl  radical  (see  the  inset  for  structure), 
which  is  small  enough  for  both  fast  and  accurate  ab  initio 
calculation and possesses convenient symmetry. Ten constrained 
DFT  B3LYP  6-311G(2d,2p)  optimization  runs  were  performed 
in  PCM  water  with  CCCF  dihedral  angle  restricted  to  values 
from 0° to 90°. Hyperfine couplings were then computed for each optimized geometry 
with the basis set changed to EPR-III. Energy differences due to basis set superposition 
error [103, 104] have been neglected in the geometry optimization.

The  computation  results  are  presented  on  Figures  2.10-2.12.  Indeed,  as  can  be 
seen from Figure 2.10, for certain conformations the 19F hyperfine coupling is in excess 
of  40  Gauss,  which  is  nearly  twice  as  much  as  the  largest  HFC  found  in  the  ring-
fluorinated  radicals.  However,  the  consideration  of  the  conformation  energies  shows 
that  the  high-HFC  conformations  are  the  least  favourable,  with  Boltzmann  weights  of 
about  10%,  and  the  energetically  favourable  confirmations  have  low  HFCs.  The 
Boltzmann average for the 19F isotropic hyperfine coupling at room temperature works 
out  to  10.6  Gauss,  which  is  smaller  than  the  hyperfine  couplings  found  in  3-
fluorotyrosine and 4- and 6-fluorotryptophans. 

 
Given  the  synthetic  difficulty  of  preparing  β-fluorinated  aromatic  amino  acids, 
and  the  above  mentioned  fact  that  the  average  hyperfine  coupling  does  not  offer  any 
benefits  compared  to  ring-fluorinated  amino  acids,  it  was  decided  not  to  try  β-
fluorinated amino acids experimentally.

Not  doing  any  experiments  would  not  prevent  us  from  harvesting  some 
interesting  conclusions  from  the  calculations  though.  A  potential  difficulty  (or  a 
potential source of information if handled properly) with fluorine in a β-position of an 
amino acid is its relaxation behaviour. For ring nuclei of aromatic systems the isotropic 
hyperfine  coupling  is  either  constant  (in  a  naive  rigid  approximation),  or  modulated 
with frequencies far removed from NMR frequency range (if we account for molecular 
vibrations). The primary relaxation mechanism therefore is purely rotational modulation 
of  otherwise  static  anisotropies.  The  β-position,  however,  has  both  the  isotropic  HFC 
and  HFC  anisotropy  modulated  in  amplitude,  as  a  function  of  the  dihedral  angle. 
Because all three modulations (isotropic magnitude, anisotropic magnitude, anisotropic 
orientation)  are  functions  of  the  same  angles  and  at  least  two  of  them  (isotropic  and

anisotropic  magnitude)  are  strongly  correlated,  this  leads  to  a  very  complex  cross-
correlated  behaviour,  which,  although  it  could  be  interesting  in  its  own  right,  it  is  not 
author’s wish to untangle6.

coupling for two protons of the fluoromethyl group parafluoromethylphenoxyl 
radical and the Boltzmann weights of corresponding conformations at 298 K. 

 
While  the  complicated  paramagnetic  relaxation  behaviour  may  be  of  no 
 
consequence  for  qualitative  CW  photo-CIDNP  studies,  and  certainly  is  of  no 
consequence  if  no  CIDNP  experiments  are  planned,  the  rotational  dependence  of 
magnetic shielding tensor in neutral fluoromethylbenzene suggests that the diamagnetic 
relaxation description is likely to be just as complicated [105]. 
 
 
2.5 Experimental reconnaissance 
 
Armed  with  the  hyperfine  couplings  and  g-factors  in  the  intermediate  radicals, 
 
we  can  proceed  to  explore  the  19F  photo-CIDNP  effect  experimentally.  There  are 
several  experimentally  determined  conditions  that  the  compound  should  satisfy  to  be 
useful in high-accuracy photo-CIDNP experiments. It should be photochemically stable, 
i.e.  should  survive  as  many  photocycles  (Figure  1.1)  as  possible  without  degrading  or 
bleaching  the  photosensitizer.  The  chemical  shift  of  the  fluorine  nucleus  should  be 
insensitive to temperature variation within about 10°C, so that the signal multiplicity is 
still possible to analyze after prolonged laser irradiation. The compound should have a 
simple spin system, be cheap and chemically well-behaved (meaning toxicity, acid-base 
equilibria, stability, etc.). This section will enumerate the compounds tested. 

                                                 
6The situation may be somewhat simpler if the amino acid is rigidly immobilized in the protein core, but 
all the interesting CIDNP-active amino acids are likely to be exposed and have their CH2 groups tumbling 
to some extent with very complicated rotational correlation functions.

2.5.1 2-fluorophenol 
 
The spin system of 2-fluorophenol is reasonably simple, with all signals resolved 
at 600 MHz and mostly weak J-coupling between the nuclei. Least squares fitting of the 
theoretical  ABCDX  spectrum  to  the  observed  1H  and  19F  spectra  pulls  out  an 
unremarkable set of J-couplings and chemical shifts (Figure 2.13).

shown  in  red (with  lines  made  narrower for  clarity)  are  simulated  with  the  following 
scalar  coupling  constants:  JH(3)-F=11.6  Hz,  JH(4)-F=4.7  Hz,  JH(6)-F=8.9  Hz,  JH(3)-H(4)=8.2 
Hz, JH(3)-H(5)=1.2 Hz, JH(4)-H(5)=7.5 Hz, JH(4)-H(6)=1.6 Hz, JH(5)-H(6)=8.1 Hz. The coupling 
constants  were  obtained  by  least  squares  fitting  of  the  model  spectrum  to  the 
experimental  data.  The  spectral  assignment  and  the  positive  sign  of  all  J-coupling 
constants  were  confirmed  by  a  GIAO  DFT  B3LYP  aug-cc-pVTZ-J  ab  initio 
calculation. The fitted line width (a variable parameter during the fitting procedure) is 
0.44 Hz (1H) and 1.37 Hz (19F). 

Based  on 

 
 
the  known  hyperfine  couplings  and  g-factors  for  both  2-
fluorophenoxyl  and  flavosemiquinone  radicals,  the  simple  calculation  described  in 
Section  1.3  predicts  a  strong  absorptive  enhancement  for  F(2),  moderate  emissive 
enhancements for H(4) and H(6), and small absorptive enhancements for H(3) and H(5) 
in 2-fluorophenol. The CIDNP enhancement of the H(3,5) protons should be very small 
in  a  steady-state  photo-CIDNP  experiment  because  of  excessive  bulk  recombination 
cancellation  resulting  from  slow  paramagnetic  relaxation,  which  in  turn  results  from 
small  anisotropy  of  hyperfine  coupling  on  H(3)  and  H(5)  nuclei  (Table  2.2).  The 
behaviour  of  H(3)  and  H(5)  magnetization  on  a  CW  CIDNP  experiment  is  therefore 
likely  to  be  governed  almost  entirely  by  dipolar  cross-relaxation  and  DD-CSA  cross-
correlation with strongly polarised nearby nuclei. This is indeed the case, as shown on 
Figures  2.14  and  2.15.  The  only  seeming  anomaly  –  the  emissive  enhancement  and 
multiplet  distortion  on  H(5),  which  is  positioned  far  from  the  fluorine,  gets  explained

realised that it is actually the strong J-coupling that makes H(5) signal follow the nearby 
H(6)  and  get  inverted  with  a  distorted  multiplet  structure.  This  behaviour  is 
demonstrated more clearly in theoretical spectra shown in Figure 2.16. It is caused by 
transverse  bilinear  terms  that  are  present  in  the  strong  J-coupling  Hamiltonian,  and  
unless  due  care  is  taken,  these  can  be  easily  confused  with  NOEs  or  DD-CSA  cross-
correlation effects.

times is caused by non-uniform sample heating by the intense laser light.

Fitting the magnetization dynamics (Figure 2.17) to a linear longitudinal model 
similar  to  (1.37),  with  constant  pumping  terms  and  cross-relaxation  between  the 
adjacent nuclei, results in the following CIDNP pumping rates: –20.8 s–1 for H(4), –6.4 
s–1  for  H(6),  117  s–1  for  F(2).  Although  H(3)  and  H(5)  dynamics  is  fitted  reasonably 
well  (Figure  2.17),  the  resulting  values  are  unlikely  to  be  correct  because  the  model 
fitted does not include the above mentioned strong coupling effects.

There  are  two  more  things  to  note  about  Figures  2.14-2.17.  One  is  that  long 
irradiation  times  lead  to  a  severe  resolution  deterioration  in  the  19F  spectrum,  likely 
resulting  from  non-uniform  sample  heating  by  the  laser  light.  The  other  is  that  the 
simple  relaxation  model  with  constant  pumping  terms  appears  to  be  sufficient  to 
describe (or at least to fit) the observed magnetization dynamics.

Lastly, the photostability  of 2-fluorophenol/FMN system is very high, with the 
photodegradation curves essentially repeating those shown in Chapter 3 (Figure 3.9) for 
the  4-fluorophenol/FMN  system,  meaning  that  hundreds  of  flashes  may  be  performed 
on this system without significant photodegradation. 
 
2.5.2 3-fluorophenol 
19F  CIDNP  effect  magnitude  ob-
 
served in 3-fluorophenol is relatively small 
compared  to  the  other  two  fluorophenols 
because  of  smaller  spin  density  on  the 
fluorine nucleus in the intermediate radical 
as well as smaller HFC anisotropy, which 
leads  to  greater  extent  of  recombination 
cancellation  in  the  secondary  dynamics 
(this effect is analyzed in detail in chapter 
8). The photo-CIDNP pumping rate meas-
ured for the 19F nucleus is –11.5 s–1, which 
is  ten  and  thirteen  times  less  than  the 
pumping  rates  in  2-  and  4-fluorophenols 
respectively. Thus, although the total fluo-
rine  polarisation  in  3-fluorophenol  can  be 
pumped up to not insignificant 7 times the 
equilibrium value, the potential for gener-
ating long-range 19F-1H NOEs is relatively 
small for this compound. The changes that 
fluorine  and  proton  NMR  signals  of  3-
fluorophenol  undergo  as  the  irradiation 
time  gets  longer  are  shown  in  Figures 
2.19, 2.20 and analyzed in Figure

and approximately –16 s–1 for the overlapping signals of H(4) and H(6). The accumula-
tion of longitudinal multi-spin orders is clearly manifested on the fluorine spectra, a re-
sult of either direct pumping (CIDNP multiplet effect) or  19F-1H DD-CSA cross-corre-
lation. This effect is analyzed in detail in Chapter 4.

In the absence of confusing effects resulting from strong J-couplings, it is clearly 
seen that the nuclear cross-relaxation in chemically pumped systems (e.g. H(4,6)→H(5) 
in  the  present  case  of  3-fluorophenol,  Figure  2.21)  appears  to  be  unaffected  by  the 
exotic  origin  of  the  nuclear  magnetization  and  proceeds  just  as  the  usual  cross-

relaxation  and  cross-correlation  in  chemically  static  systems,  likely  because  the 
concentration  of  radical  intermediates  at  any  point  in  time  is  vanishingly  small 
compared to the overall sample concentration. Figure 2.21 shows that the initial slope of 
the H(5) magnetization is zero, indicating the lack of direct pumping, but there is some 
later magnetization pickup from cross-relaxation, which proceeds with the rate constant 
of  about  –0.016  s–1,  which  is  a  common  number  for  an  NOE  between  the  adjacent 
protons in small aromatic molecules at 600 MHz. 

 
The  observation  that  the  dipolar  relaxation  does  not  seem  to  inherit  the 
complexity  of  the  CIDNP  generation  processes  has  far  reaching  implications. 
Specifically,  this  means  that  the  standard  relaxation  theoretical  approaches  may  be 
applicable  to  the  CIDNP-pumped  systems,  the  only  change  being  that  the  constant 
“magnetization  source”  terms  need  to  be  introduced  into  the  density  matrix  evolution 
equation  for  the  duration  of  the  laser  flash.  This  conclusion  is  investigated  in  further 
detail in Chapter 3. 

 

2.5.3 4-fluorophenol 
Consistent with the very large hyperfine coupling in the intermediate radical, 4-
 
fluorophenol  exhibits  a  record  19F  CIDNP  amplitude  with  the  magnetization  pumping 
rate of 148 s–1. The polarisation attained after about 2 seconds of irradiation is 55-fold 
(Figures  2.22,  2.23).  H(2)  and  H(6)  have  got  –8.3  s–1  CIDNP  pumping  rate.  The 
magnetization dynamics of H(3,5) is a superposition of very weak direct photo-CIDNP, 
cross-relaxation  and  J-coupling  effects,  therefore,  although  it  is  fitted  reasonably  well 
by the linear model, we should not expect the resulting parameters to be of any physical 
significance.

setup. Just as the other fluorophenols, 4-fluorophenol appears to be highly resistant to 
photodegradation  with  a  few  hundred  flashes  needed 
to  achieve  noticeable 
photobleaching.

longitudinal model. 

As  a  side  note,  4-fluorophenol  appears  to  associate  in  DMSO,  leading  to 

additional splitting in 19F spectrum, presumably due to formation of a hydrogen bond. 

 

2.5.4 Fluorotryptophans 
As  we  have  concluded  in  Section  2.4,  out  of  a  large  number  of  possible 
 
fluorinated  tryptophans,  4-  and  6-fluorinated  isomers  deserve  a  closer  attention.  As  a 
test  of  a  negative  prediction,  the  relatively  cheap  5-fluoro-DL-tryptophan,  which  was 
theoretically predicted to have a zero 19F photo-CIDNP, was also included. Experiments 
and  processing  identical  to  those  described  in  Sections  2.5.1-2.5.3    for  fluorophenols 
have  been  performed  on  three  fluorotryptohans.  An  example  of  the  observed 
magnetization  dynamics  is  shown  in  Figure  2.24  and  the  resulting  photo-CIDNP 
magnetization pumping rates are reported in Table 2.6. 

 
As  predicted  above  (see  Tables  2.4  and  2.5),  the  19F  photo-CIDNP  in  5-
fluorotryptophan is close to zero, while the other two isomers demonstrate the expected 
high magnetization pumping rates. A notable feature of the magnetization accumulation 
curves is the fact that although the equilibrium CIDNP of 6-fluorophenol is greater than 
that of 4-fluorophenol, the pumping rate is actually lower. This is due to the fact that the 
fluorine in 4-position of the indole ring is positioned very close to CH2 protons which 
induce  rapid  relaxation  via  DD  and  DD-CSA  mechanisms.  On  the  other  hand,  the

fluorine atom of 6-fluorotryptophans has fewer protons around, so it relaxes slower and 
consequently has a greater equilibrium CIDNP.

laser irradiation time. Fresh sample was used for each point to avoid excessive photobleaching. 
The curves are theoretical fits to a linear longitudinal model 

 
In all experimentally studied fluorotryptophans the 19F chemical shift appears to 
 
be strongly dependent on temperature. Because temperature gradients are inevitable in 
continuous-wave  photo-CIDNP  experiments,  the  resolution  degradation  is  sometimes 
very pronounced. While this does not cause any problems with overall signal intensity 
quantification,  the  multiplet  structure  is  severely  obscured.  This  makes  fluorinated 
tryptophans  unsuitable  for  chemically  pumped  cross-relaxation  studies,  because  an 
accurate  account  of  DD-CSA  cross-correlation  requires  multiplet  structure  to  be 
resolved at all times.

The photostability of fluorotryptophan/FMN systems is very low, with only 16 
 
laser  flashes  (see  Section  2.2  for  experimental  details)  necessary  to  achieve  a  near-
complete  bleaching  of  the  photosensitizer,  likely  due  to  irreversible  photooxidation  of 
the tryptophan indole ring.

2.5.5 Fluorotyrosines 
 
Of the two ring-fluorinated tyrosines, the 2-fluorinated isomer has been ruled out 
based  on  the  computed  hyperfine  couplings  (Table  2.3).  The  3-fluorinated  isomer 
exhibits  a  19F  photo-CIDNP  magnetization  pumping  rate  of  34  s–1  with  an  attainable 
polarization  of over 20 times the Boltzmann level.

The same spectrum recorded with 19F decoupling. See Figure 3.1 for 19F NMR 
spectrum and Figure 2.2 for atom numbering. 

 
The  19F  chemical  shift  of  3-fluorotyrosine  has  a  very  weak  temperature 
 
dependence  with  a  result  that  19F  spectra  retain  high  resolution  even  after  very 
prolonged  laser  irradiation  periods.  The  3-fluorotyrosine/FMN  system  also  possesses 
remarkable  photostability,  enduring  at  least  50  laser  flashes  without  noticeable 
photodegradation.  These  observations,  and  also  the  fact  that  3-fluorotyrosine  has  a 
convenient  spin  system  with  a  well-resolved  J-coupling  (Figures  2.25  and  3.1),  mean 
that,  of  all  the  compounds  studied  so  far,  3-fluorotyrosine  is  probably  best  suited  for 
exploring further behaviour of chemically pumped nuclear magnetization.

A  simple  way  to  get  an  idea  of  the 
magnitude  of  the  photo-CIDNP  driven  19F-1H 
cross-relaxation  effect  is  to  monitor  the  proton 
relaxation  pattern  in  a  saturation-recovery  type 
experiment.  If  protons  are  decoupled  during  the 
irradiation  period  (Figure  2.26),  this  prevents  the 
accumulation of 1H CIDNP magnetization. At the 
end  of  the  irradiation  period  the  decoupler  is 
switched  off  allowing 
the  proton  nuclear 
subensemble  to  relax  in  the  presence  of  strongly 
polarized  19F  nuclei.  Any  powerful  manifestation  of  19F-1H  cross-relaxation  should 
distort  the  proton  relaxation  picture,  which  is  made  observable  by  the  final  90-degree 
pulse.

Figure 2.27 shows the spectra obtained from the sequence shown in Figure 2.26. 
When  the  laser  irradiation  of  the  sample  is  not  performed  (Figure  2.27A),  the  proton 
relaxation pattern looks like a typical saturation-recovery experiment with little, if any, 
cross-relaxation present. However, the saturation-recovery experiment performed in the 
presence of a nearby strongly polarized  19F nucleus leads to dramatic changes (Figure 
2.27B).  There  are  both  strong  nuclear  Overhauser  effect  (H(5)  proton  magnetization 
briefly  goes  negative)  and  DD-CSA  cross-correlated  cross-relaxation  effect  (weakly 
coupled H(2) doublet components acquire unequal intensities) from fluorine to protons. 
The  amplitude  of  the  effects  and  the  spectral  resolution  are  sufficient  for  an  accurate 
quantitative analysis, which is performed in Chapter 3. 
 
 
If the laser irradiation period is extended into the mixing time in the sequence on 
Figure  2.26,  the  cross-relaxation  and  cross-correlation  effects  become  even  more 
dramatic  (Figure  2.28).  The  behaviour  of  the  H(2)  magnetization,  which  does  not 
receive direct pumping, becomes governed almost entirely by cross-correlation with the 
result that it becomes antiphase with respect to the 19F-1H J-coupling and in that shape 
gets accumulated in the spin system (Figure 2.28A). Even after the laser is switched off 
(Figure  2.28B),  the  accumulation  of  this  antiphase  signal  continues  for  some  time, 
driven by the strong polarization that has accumulated on fluorine.

The  amplitudes  of  the  relaxation  effects  shown  in  figures  2.27  and  2.28  are 
remarkably large, with Overhauser effects and cross-correlations of the order of 50% of 
the equilibrium signal intensity. Such amplitudes of, for example, the 2HzFz longitudinal 
two-spin  order  that  the  H(2)  signal  demonstrates  in  Figure  2.28A,  are  impossible  to 
generate  if  one  starts  from  the  thermal  equilibrium  spin  polarization.  The  situation 
clearly  merits  further  investigation  (which  is  reported  in  Chapter  3),  and  3-
fluorotyrosine appears to be particularly convenient for that purpose. 

 
 
2.6 Summary 
 
The  reconnaissance  experiments  described  in  this  chapter  have  highlighted  the 
following conditions as important in the choice of an informative photo-CIDNP system: 

 

Ability  for  a  4  mM  donor,  0.2  mM  FMN  D2O  solution  to  withstand  at  least  50 
laser  flashes  at  488  nm,  100  ms,  5  W  output  power  without  substantial 
photodegradation. Pass: fluorophenols, fluorotyrosines. Fail: fluorotryptophans. 
 
Weak temperature dependence of 1H and 19F chemical shifts. Pass: fluorotyrosine. 
Fail: fluorophenols, fluorotryptophans. 
 
Simple  spin  system  and  well  resolved  signal  multiplets.  Pass:  4-fluorophenol,  3-
fluorotyrosine.

Chapter 2. 19F nucleus: exploratory calculations and photo-CIDNP experiments. 
 

Based on these criteria, the best system for quantitative investigation appears to be 3-
fluorotyrosine. 

The predictive power of ab initio hyperfine tensor calculations appears to be impressive, 
with no experimentally detected deviations from the expected photo-CIDNP behaviour. 

 

 

From the qualitative relaxation experiments it appears that the diamagnetic dipolar and 
DD-CSA  relaxation  do  not  inherit  the  complexity  of  the  CIDNP  generation  processes 
and  may  be  described  by  a  simple  extension  to  the  Redfield  relaxation  theory, 
specifically,  by  including  the  constant  “magnetization  source”  terms  into  the  density 
matrix evolution equation for the duration of the laser flash.

ased  on  the  reconnaissance  experiments  and  calculations  described  in 
Chapter 2, this Chapter details a systematic investigation into the relaxa-
tion processes in a chemically pumped  19F-1H spin system of 3-fluoroty-
rosine. In particular, it explores the 19F photo-CIDNP effect as a source of 
strong long-range  19F-1H heteronuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). The measurements 
described  below  characterise  the 
19F-1H  dipole-dipole  (DD)  cross-

benefits this established community and ensures that the more complicated biophysical 
systems are at hand, should the exploratory experiments appear promising. 

 
From  a  practical  point  of  view,  3-fluorotyrosine  is  convenient  because  it  has  a 
very weak dependence of the 19F chemical shift on temperature and is photochemically 
more  robust  than  fluorophenols  or  fluorotryptophans  (see  Chapter  2  for  details).  At  a 
magnetic  induction  of  14.1  T  (600  MHz  proton  frequency)  another  valuable  feature 
emerges:  the  proton  on  the  left  hand  side  of  the  aromatic  ring  (Figure  3.1)  becomes 
weakly  J-coupled  to  the  protons  on  the  right  hand  side.  This  eliminates  a  fair  deal  of 
complicated mathematics from the relaxation analysis of the spin system. Last, but not 
least, 3-fluorotyrosine is cheap. 
 
 
3.2 Chemically pumped 19F-1H cross-relaxation – theoretical setup 
 

From the preliminary experiments described in Chapter 2 and prior work on 1H 
photo-CIDNP pumped cross-relaxation [116] it appears that for the purpose of nuclear 
spin relaxation analysis the production of CIDNP by continuous low-power illumination 
of  an  NMR  sample  in  a  strong  magnetic  field  can  be  described  by  adding  constant 
magnetisation-source terms to the equation of motion of the density operator of the spin 
system in the absence of the photochemical reaction (i.e. in the dark)

zIˆ  is the z-magnetisation operator for the i-th nucleus and 

where i
ip  is the corresponding 
photo-CIDNP  magnetisation  pumping  rate,  which  can  be  either  positive  or  negative. 

The  CIDNP  source  terms  are  non-stochastic  and  time-independent,  so  they  appear 

unchanged  in  the  magnetisation  mode  evolution  equations  obtained  after  treating  the 

spin  system  in  the  Redfield  relaxation  matrix  formalism  [9].  CIDNP  multiplet  effects 
[41,  117],  if  present,  can  be  introduced  by  adding  similar  source  terms  for  the 

longitudinal multi-spin orders. 
 

Although a rigorous analysis of the longitudinal cross-relaxation of the fluorine 
and the H(2) proton in 3-fluorotyrosine (see Figure 3.1 for numbering scheme) should 
strictly include all three protons in the aromatic ring, and possibly also the β-CH2 and 
α-CH protons, it will be shown below that the experimental data are fully described by 
a simpler relaxation model that includes the interaction of the anisotropically shielded 
19F nucleus with the adjacent H(2) as an AX spin system and neglects the contributions 
of the remote protons.

significant rhombicity [35]. Equation (3.4), rather than the expression for an axial tensor 
[37], is therefore preferred. 
 

In  the  extreme  narrowing  limit  and  taking  B0  =  14.1  T  (600  MHz  proton 

frequency), one obtains the following expressions for the cross-relaxation rates 

                                                 
7The anisotropy of the aromatic proton chemical shielding tensors is typically about 10 ppm, more than an 
order  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  anisotropy  of  19F  shielding.  Aromatic  protons  also  exhibit  much 
smaller photo-CIDNP enhancements. On these grounds, the contribution of δH,HF term to the evolution of 
the longitudinal two-spin order in Equation (3.3) has been neglected and the term was explicitly zeroed to 
reduce variational freedom.

multipliers are introduced to account for the difference in the equilibrium polarisations 
of protons and fluorine if both are normalised to unity. 
 
 
3.3 Experimental methods 
 

1H and  19F photo-CIDNP spectra were recorded  on  a  600  MHz  (14.1  T)  NMR 
spectrometer  equipped  with  a  5  mm  19F-{1H}  probe.  The  light  source  was  a  Spectra-
Physics Stabilite 2016-05 argon  ion  laser, operating  in  multi-line  mode  at  5  W  output 
power,  principally  at  488  and  514  nm.  A  mechanical  shutter  controlled  by  the 
spectrometer  was  employed  to  produce  light  pulses  of  0.05-6.40  s  duration.  The  light 
was brought into the 5 mm sample tube from above via a 1 mm diameter optical fibre 
(Newport  F-MBE),  positioned  inside  a  coaxial  insert  (Wilmad  WGS  5BL)  whose  tip 
was 2 mm above the top of the NMR coil [75]. After shimming, this arrangement has no 
adverse effect on the NMR resolution or line shape and requires no modification to the 
NMR probe [118]. An air-tight sample re-injection system was employed to counteract 
depletion of the photosensitizer [118], such that there was negligible photoreduction for 
up to 12 s total irradiation time. 

 
A D2O solution containing 4 mM 3-fluoro-DL-tyrosine (Lancaster) and 0.2 mM 
FMN (Sigma Aldrich) at pH 5.0 (uncorrected for deuterium isotope effect), purged with 
argon for 20 minutes, was used in all experiments. During each experiment the sample 
was irradiated for a prescribed time and, after a variable relaxation delay, subjected to a 
90°  pulse  on  either  1H  or  19F  followed  by  immediate  acquisition  of  the  free  induction 
decay. No paramagnetic broadening was detected in any of the 3-fluorotyrosine spectra, 
consistent  with  the  low  steady  state  concentration  of  radicals  produced  during  the 
irradiation periods and their rapid recombination when the light is extinguished. 

After application of a shifted Gaussian window function, zero-filling and Fourier 
transformation,  the  spectra  were  integrated  using  mixed  Lorentzian-Gaussian  line 
H H F   magnetization 
4 z
fitting.  The  magnitudes  of  the 
z
modes at the end of the relaxation delay were calculated from the integrals of individual 
lines  in  the  19F  multiplet.  Equation  (3.2)  was  solved  using  a  4th-order  adaptive  grid

Runge-Kutta method with 10–10 relative error on each integration step. Minimization of 
the  weighted  least  squares  error  functional  was  performed  using  the  Nelder-Mead 
simplex method. A Monte-Carlo method was employed to estimate errors in the fitting 
parameters. Libraries supplied with the Matlab 6.0 software package were used for all 
these computations. 

 
 

3.4 Computational methods 
 

Computation of in vacuo equilibrium geometry and hyperfine coupling constants 
were  performed  using  the  GAMESS  program  [77,  119]  at  the  DFT  B3LYP  6-
311G**/EPR-III level. The in vacuo 19F magnetic shielding tensor was estimated using 
Gaussian98  [76]  at  the  GIAO  HF  6-311++G(2d,  2p)  level  using  the  3-fluorotyrosine 
geometry  obtained  from  a  separate  B3LYP  6-311G**  GAMESS  calculation.  The 
relatively inexpensive Hartree-Fock based computation of the shielding tensor was used 
because  previous  studies  had  revealed  no  obvious  advantage  of  MPn,  CI  or  other 
methods  accounting  for  electron  correlation  for  the  19F  nuclei  of  the  molecules  in 
question [120]. The calculated hyperfine couplings for the neutral radicals derived from 
tyrosine  and  3-fluorotyrosine  by  abstraction  of  hydrogen  from  the  phenolic  OH  group 
are  given  in  Table  3.1  together  with  the  experimental  values  for  the  tyrosyl  radical 
[121]. 

 
The computing power was provided by a home-made heterogeneous GAMESS 
cluster built to harvest computing power from the laboratory UltraSparcIII+/Solaris and 
(Pentium4,  AthlonMP)/Linux  workstations.  Built-in  socket-based  parallelisation  was 
used in the case of GAMESS-US and LAM/MPI based parallelisation in the case of PC 
GAMESS  [119].  The  interlink  was  provided  by  gigabit  Ethernet.  A  built-in  load 
levelling mechanism was used for all computations. 
 
 
3.5 Results 
 

Figures  3.2  to  3.5  illustrate  the  changes  in  the  19F  and  1H  NMR  spectra  and 
polarizations  of  3-fluorotyrosine  produced  by  laser  irradiation.  Under  continuous 
irradiation the fluorine CIDNP magnetisation pumping rate is pF = +34 s−1 (Figures 3.1 
and 3.4A, left hand panel), i.e. the initial build-up rate of the Fz mode corresponds to the 
accumulation  of  34-fold  19F  hyperpolarization  per  second.  The  CIDNP  magnetisation 
pumping rate for the adjacent H(2) proton is pH = +1.3 s−1, hence the initial slow rise 
(Figure  3.4A,  right  hand  panel).  After  four  seconds  of  irradiation,  the  19F  z-
magnetization  reaches  a  steady  state,  in  which  the  CIDNP  magnetisation  pumping  is 
balanced  by  relaxation,  corresponding  to  24  times  the  equilibrium  magnetization

(Figure 3.4A, left hand panel). Under continuous laser irradiation the 19F magnetisation 
stays at this level. Under identical conditions, the polarization of H(3) in tyrosine itself 
has a much smaller pumping rate, pH ≈ −5 s−1. 

 
Increasing  the  laser  output  power  from  5  to  25  W  gives  up  to  40-fold  19F 
equilibrium hyperpolarization in the 3-fluorotyrosine-FMN system. Higher polarisation 
is difficult to obtain due to sample heating by the intense laser light.

deterioration in the spectral resolution in set (A) is due to non-uniform sample heating by the laser.

 after several seconds of irradiation attains a steady state value of

solid lines are the results of fitting Equation (3.2) to the data. The pulse sequences are shown on figure 6. 

The  time  dependence  of  the  H(2) 
z-magnetisation is a result of competition 
between  direct  CIDNP  pumping  and  19F-
1H  dipolar  cross-relaxation  (Figure  3.4A, 
right hand panel). The CIDNP of H(2) in 
tyrosine  and  3-fluorotyrosine  is  weakly 
absorptive, and causes the Hz polarisation 
to  rise  initially  to  about  150%  of  the 
equilibrium  polarisation.  However,  the 
negative  NOE  from  the  highly  polarised 
19F  nucleus  gradually  overwhelms  the  1H 
CIDNP:  after  about  six  seconds  of 
irradiation the observed  1H polarisation is 
pushed  below  zero,  corresponding  to  a 
NOE  of  around  –100%,  resulting  from 
competition between  1H CIDNP pumping

and  the  19F-1H  NOE.  In  complex  molecules  (e.g.  a  19F-labelled  protein)  most  protons 
have  no  CIDNP  of  their  own.  Solving  Equation  (3.2)  with  pH  set  to  zero  leads  to  an 
actual NOE magnitude of around –400% after six seconds of irradiation (Figure 3.4A, 
right hand panel).  
 

The  19F-1H  spin  system  shows  similar  behaviour  in  dynamic  CIDNP  NOE 
experiments. The three panels in Figure 3.4B show the magnetization evolution after a 
500 ms laser flash. Because the 19F CIDNP enhancement after 500 ms irradiation is only 
about 15-fold and decays quickly, the cross-relaxation and cross-correlation effects are 
 
weaker,  but  still  very  pronounced.  In  particular,  it  can  be  seen  that  the 
0
two-spin  order  first  grows  to  an  amplitude  of  −1.5  and  then  decays  to  zero.  The 
longitudinal  1H magnetisation 
zH  first loses the CIDNP that accumulated during the 
irradiation, briefly dips about 25% below its equilibrium value as a result of the 19F-1H 
NOE, and gradually relaxes to equilibrium. Solving Equation (3.2) using pH = 0 gives a 
NOE of −55%.

As  mentioned  above,  the  19F-1H  NOE  is  considerably  more  pronounced  when 
the proton has no counteracting CIDNP of its own. This can be demonstrated in the case 
of 3-fluorotyrosine by destroying the  1H CIDNP by decoupling the protons during the 
laser  flash.  Figure  3.4C  shows  the  evolution  of  the  magnetisation  modes  after  a  1.0  s 
laser flash, with 1H decoupling. Once the decoupler is switched off (at t = 0), the 
)2(
zH  
magnetisation abruptly goes negative as a result of the 19F-1H NOE, reaching a value of 
H
 which is above the maximum theoretical NOE for conventional NMR 
and  exceeds  the  magnitudes  of  19F-1H  NOEs  usually  observed  in  such  systems  by  a 
factor of five. 
 
The  DD  and  DD-CSA  cross  relaxation  rates  measured  for  the  F-H(2)  spin 
system are presented in Table 3.2. The values of the correlation time τc and the 19F CSA

The relatively large 19F CIDNP build-up rate reported above (+34 s−1) compared 
to the corresponding proton in tyrosine (−5 s−1) is at least partially due to the different 
magnetic  properties  of  the  intermediate  radicals.  The  19F  hyperfine  coupling  constant 
computed for the 3-fluorotyrosyl radical is +1.57 mT (Table 3.1) as opposed to −0.65 
mT for the corresponding proton in the tyrosyl radical [121]. For non-viscous solutions 
and  in  a  strong  magnetic  field,  the  geminate  CIDNP  effect  of  a  particular  nucleus  is 
proportional to its hyperfine coupling constant in the intermediate radical [116]. Larger 
hyperfine interactions also lead to faster nuclear spin-lattice relaxation in the radical and

complex  molecular  system,  such  as  a  fluorine-

dipolar energy transfer could occur, either directly 
or mediated by intervening protons.

The  measured  dipolar  cross-relaxation 
rates and NOE magnitudes allow one to speculate 
about  CIDNP-induced  19F-1H  NOEs  when  3-
fluorotyrosine  is  incorporated  into  a  larger  molecule.  Assuming  that  the  destination 
atom  has  no  CIDNP  of  its  own  (which  would  normally  be  the  case)  and  taking  the 
detectable  NOE  enhancement  to  be  about  1%,  one  can  make  a  rough  estimate  that  an 
NOE  effect  that  reaches  a  magnitude  of  400%  at  2.60  Å  distance  would  be  still 
detectable at distances of up to about 2.60(400)1/6 = 7 Å. 

 

A  consideration  of  the  dependence  of  the  polarisation  transfer  rates  on  the 
rotational  correlation  time  (Figure  3.7)  provides  another  argument  in  favour  of 
chemically pumped 19F-1H NOEs. The isotropic correlation time for 3-fluorotyrosine is 
about  10−10  s,  with  the  result  that  both 
HFF ,δ   are  comparable  and  relatively 
HFσ   and 
small. For a (~25 kDa) protein with τc of about 20 ns, however, the DD cross-relaxation 
HFσ   would  be  approximately  30  times  larger,  while  the  cross-correlation  rate  is 
rate 
barely  changed.  This  does  not  necessarily  imply  a  30-fold  increase  the  CIDNP  NOE, 
because  longitudinal  self-relaxation  will  also  be  faster  in  the  more  slowly  tumbling 
molecule,  but  it  certainly  means  that  the  drain  of  fluorine  magnetization  into 
longitudinal multi-spin orders will be reduced. 

 
In  most  one-  and  multi-dimensional  experiments,  using  CIDNP  as  a  source  of 
strong nuclear polarization amounts simply to adding photosensitizer to the sample and 
inserting a laser flash at the start of the pulse sequence [48], accompanied, if necessary, 
by simultaneous decoupling to remove undesired direct CIDNP effects. For experiments

requiring  a  large  number  of  scans,  photosensitizer  depletion  can  be  countered  by 
employing a sample re-injection device [118]. 

 
The phenomenon explored herein is known in the proton-proton case as CINOE 
(Chemically  Induced  NOE)  [124].  This  abbreviation  seems  unsatisfactory  for  two 
reasons. First, NOE is not induced, only amplified by chemical pumping. And second, 
this  abbreviation  does  not  match  the  NMR  abbreviation  standards  in  that  it  has  no 
(preferably  awkward)  second  meaning.  I  therefore  suggest  that  this  Chemically 
Amplified Nuclear Overhauser Effect be referred to as CANOE.

Uniform illumination of 
optically dense NMR 
samples 

Based on: I. Kuprov, P.J. Hore, J. Magn. Res. 171 (2004) 171-175. 

 
 
 
4.1 Introduction 

A 

 
variety  of  photochemical  NMR  experiments  require  illumination  of  the 
sample  inside  the  NMR  probe,  including  but  not  limited  to:  photo-CIDNP 
(Chemically  Induced  Dynamic  Nuclear  Polarization)  [42,  47,  125],  metal 
ion  release  from  photolabile  cage  compounds  [72,  126],  photochemical  kinetics  [57, 
127, 128] and studies of photoactive proteins [129-132]. 
 

One of the biggest technical challenges faced in such experiments is to deliver 
light  efficiently  into  the  active  region  of  the  NMR  sample.  Ideally,  the  entire  sample 
volume  should  be  uniformly  illuminated  to  maximise  sensitivity  and  to  avoid 
concentration  and  temperature  gradients,  which  might  distort  the  observed  kinetics. 
Such  problems  are  likely  to  be  most  severe  for  optically  dense  samples.  It  is  highly 
desirable that uniform illumination is achieved without extensive probe modifications, 
which  may  compromise  the  NMR  performance,  and  in  a  manner  that  allows  facile 
transfer  from  one  spectrometer  to  another.  Several  techniques  have  been  devised  in 
recent years, including illumination from above, below or the side, some of which are 
shown schematically in Figure 4.1. 
 

Bringing  light  in  from  the  side,  through  the  radiofrequency  (RF)  coil,  via  a 
quartz light guide and a prism or a mirror (Figure 4.1A), has the disadvantage of non-
uniform  irradiation  of  the  sensitive  region  even  if  the  sample  has  low  optical  density. 
Such an arrangement is incompatible with certain RF coil designs and can conflict with 

Chapter 4. Uniform illumination of optically dense NMR samples.

the presence of field gradient coils. Irradiation from below using a flat-bottomed NMR 
tube  (Figure  4.1B)  is  somewhat  less  demanding  technically,  but  would  still  normally 
require  the  re-location  of  electronic  components  and  variable  temperature  equipment 
inside  the  probe  body.  It  also  suffers  from  inhomogeneous  illumination  for  optically 
dense  samples,  a  problem  that  can  be  reduced  by  using  a  bespoke  NMR  sample  tube 
with  a  tapered  (“V-cone”)  interior  [51]  to  extend  illumination  into  the  active  region 
(Figure 4.1C) at the expense of both spectral resolution and sensitivity (the filling factor 
is  reduced  by  ~20%).  The  attraction  of  these  three  approaches  is  that  they  are  readily 
compatible with short, intense visible or ultraviolet pulses from YAG or excimer lasers 
as well as continuous wave (CW) light sources.

arrangement demonstrated here with a stepwise tapered optical fibre. 

To  circumvent  the  requirement  for  probe  modification,  various  methods  have 
been  suggested  for  illumination  from  above.  Almost  twenty  years  ago,  Berliner  and 
colleagues demonstrated the use of an optical fibre [75] held inside the NMR tube by 
means  of  a  coaxial  capillary  insert  (Figure  4.1D),  an  arrangement  that  has  been  used 
extensively in Oxford for photo-CIDNP studies of proteins [48, 52, 118, 133]. Because 
it introduces a magnetic susceptibility jump, the end of the insert must be positioned at 
least 2 mm above the NMR coil to avoid undue lineshape distortion. This approach is 
convenient, technically straightforward and particularly suitable for CW lasers. Pulsed 
lasers  may  be  used  only  insofar  as  the  optical  power  density  is  compatible  with  the

fibre.  Improved  uniformity  of  illumination  is  afforded  by  combining  the  optical  fibre 
with  a  “pencil  tip”  insert  as  demonstrated  by  Schwalbe  et al.  [72,  126]  (Figure  4.1E). 
While  retaining  the  simplicity  of  the  Berliner  method,  this  design,  like  the  V-cone, 
sacrifices some sensitivity and resolution. 
 

In  this  chapter  a  straightforward  and  inexpensive  method  is  proposed  for 
illumination from above in which the light is distributed along the axis of the NMR tube 
by  means  of  a  tapered  optical  fibre  (Figure  4.1F).  While  illumination  from  above  the 
coil (Figure 4.1D) gives rise to an exponential fall in light intensity from the top of the 
sensitive region to the bottom (optical path length ~20 mm), the tapered tip (with a path 
length  of  ~3  mm)  gives  almost  uniform  illumination.  This  approach  leads  to  minimal 
degradation of spectral resolution, less than a 5% loss of filling factor and requires no 
probe  modifications.  The  amount  of  light  reaching  the  NMR  sample  can  be 
conveniently  monitored  via  the  19F  photo-CIDNP  enhancement  of  4-fluorophenol 
sensitised by flavin mononucleotide (FMN). For light flashes between 1 ms and 100 ms, 
the photo-induced 19F magnetisation is a direct measure of the local light intensity [52] 
allowing the use of NMR imaging techniques to reveal the spatial distribution of light 
within the sample tube. 
 
 
4.2 Materials and methods 
 

The end of a Newport F-MBE optical fibre (1 mm outer diameter) was tapered 
using the following procedure. A 10 cm length of the plastic cladding was mechanically 
stripped from the end of the fibre, the final 2 cm of which was then immersed for 1 min 
in a mixture containing 30% HF, 20% H2SO4 and 50% H2O at 60 ºC to detach the fibre 
sheath  from  the  core.  The  exposed  core  was  rinsed  with  water  and  extruded  stepwise 
(typically 1.5 mm every 30 min) into the same acid mixture from a plastic pipette tip, 
again  at  60  ºC  (Figure  4.2A).  After  about  5  hours  the  tip  was  removed,  washed  with 
water and dried. The resulting cone tapers in typically ~11 steps down to ~50 μm over a 
length of ~20 mm (Figure 4.2B). Smaller and more frequent adjustments of the fibre in 
the  etching  medium  result  in  a  smother  cone.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  hydrofluoric 
acid solution is extremely toxic and volatile when hot. 
 

19F  photo-CIDNP  spectra  were  recorded  on  a  Varian  Inova  600  MHz  (14.1  T) 
NMR  spectrometer  equipped  with  a  5  mm  19F{1H}  z-gradient  probe.  The  light  source 
was a Spectra Physics BeamLok 2080 argon ion laser, operating in multi-line mode at 
10  W  output  power,  principally  at  488  and  514  nm.  A  mechanical  shutter  (NM  Laser 
Products  LS200)  controlled  by  the  spectrometer  was  used  to  produce  100  ms  light 
pulses. The light was focused into a 6 m length of optical fibre (Newport F-MBE), using 
a  Newport  M-5X  objective  lens,  the  other  end  of  which  was  attached  (via  Newport

SMA connectors) to a 2 m section of the same fibre whose tapered tip was held inside a 
5 mm NMR tube by a truncated Wilmad WGS 5BL coaxial insert (Figure 4.1F). 

 
A 4.0 mM solution of 4-fluorophenol (Lancaster) in D2O containing 0.2-3.2 mM 
FMN  (Sigma)  at  pH  5.0  (uncorrected  for  deuterium  isotope  effect)  was  used  in  all 
experiments.  Samples  were  purged  with  argon  for  20  min  prior  to  use.  Profiles  of  the 
CIDNP intensity along the tube were recorded by applying a constant z-gradient during 
detection of the free induction decay in a one-scan flash-pulse-acquire experiment.

excited by the 488 nm laser line. The terminal diameter of the fibre cone is less than 50 μm. In C, the 
optical fibre appears much thicker than it actually is because of the lensing effect of the solution.  

 

 
 
4.3 Results and discussion 
 

The shape of a fibre tip resulting from the treatment described above is shown in 
Figure 4.2B. This particular specimen contains 11 steps; in different experiments, cones 
with 7 to 15 steps were produced. The best results were obtained for 10-15 steps of 1-
1.5 mm. In the absence of scratches the tips are quite robust, the most frequent damage 
being to the thinnest sections, caused by inaccurate insertion into an NMR tube. Such 
breakages are easily repaired using the etching procedure described above to produce a 
new tip by tapering the last few sections and at the same time creating a few new steps 
further up the fibre.

The light intensity distribution depends very strongly on the length of the fibre 
cone  and  the  step  size.  The  shorter  cones,  which  have  steeper  shoulders,  tend  to  emit 
light  predominantly  from  the  shoulders  leading  to  a  non-uniform  illumination  pattern. 
At the other extreme, very long cones with a large number of small steps and shoulders 
transmit light by total internal reflection to the very end of the tip, whence almost all of 
the light is emitted. The fairly uniform light emission shown in Figure 4.3 is a result of 
experimental optimisation of both the length of the cone and the size of the steps. Figure 
4.3 also shows that the emission of light from an optimum cone occurs at an angle of 
~45° to the fibre axis, predominantly from the vertical sections of the fibre between the 
shoulders,  suggesting  that  the  light  paths  are  similar  to  those  shown  in  Figure  4.3C. 
There is also some emission at the steeper shoulders.

Light intensity distributions along the axis of the sample, L(z), measured using 
19F photo-CIDNP of 4-fluorophenol, are shown in Figure 4.4. Illumination from above

the  case  of  the  tapered  fibre  tip  the  light  intensity  profile  is  much  more  even  (Figure

At  high  resolution,  the  images  in  Figure  4.4B  have  a  low  amplitude  sinusoidal

As  expected,  the  overall  19F 
CIDNP signal intensity is attenuated 
at high optical densities (Figure 4.5). 
This  is  the  result  of  both  light 
absorbance  and  attenuation  of  the 
CIDNP 
high 
photosensitizer  concentrations  (e.g. 
due  to  triplet  quenching  by  ground 
state  FMN).  For  the  most  strongly 
coloured  solutions,  irradiation  from 
above with a square cut fibre results 
in  very 
the 
sensitive region of the sample inside 
the  receiver  coil  (Figure  4.5A), 
whereas  the  light  escaping  from  the 
tapered  tip  always  illuminates  the 
active region (Figure 4.5B).

the 
presence  of  the  fibre  cone  in  the  centre

significant  deterioration 
spectral 
resolution (Figure 4.6). After appropriate

However,  as  this  broadening  should  be  the  same  for  all  lines  in  the  spectrum,  mild 
reference  deconvolution  [134]  would,  if  necessary,  restore  the  normal  lineshape  and 
width.  For  the  linewidths  commonly  encountered  in  macromolecular  NMR,  the 
presence  of  the  fibre  should  have  a  negligible  effect  on  the  resolution.  The  simplex-
based  shimming  algorithms  supplied  with  Varian  NMR  software  usually  yield  a 
sufficiently homogeneous field in less than 10 minutes.

The volume of the sample displaced by the cone is remarkably small. In Figure 
4.2C, the fibre appears thicker than it actually is because the surrounding liquid acts as a 
magnifying lens. Once the sheath has been removed, the untreated core of the fibre has 
a diameter of about 0.9 mm: simple arithmetic shows that the volume of the cone is less 
than 5% of the total sample volume. This may be one of the reasons why shimming is 
relatively straightforward. Another is that the discontinuities in magnetic susceptibility 
produced by introducing the fibre are almost exclusively perpendicular to the axis of the 
tube [135].

An important feature of the cone 
is its large light emission area: around 25 
mm2 as opposed to 0.8 mm2 in the case 
of the square cut tip. As a consequence, 
the  sample  heating  arising  from  high-
power 
is  much  more 
homogeneous.  For  the  square  cut  fibre, 
the  water  signal  has  a  long  tail  (Figure 
4.7A) 
the  presence  of 
localised hot regions (ΔT = 6 K for a 40 
Hz shift). The thin layer between the end 
of the fibre and the top of the coil (see Figure 4.1D) is probably even hotter. Supplying 
the same amount of energy to the sample via the tapered fibre tip results in a much more 
uniform  heating  as  evidenced  by  a  more  symmetrical  lineshape,  narrower  at  the  base 
(Figure 4.7B).

Chapter 4. Uniform illumination of optically dense NMR samples.  

It should be noted that the steps on the fibre cone are essential. Our experience 
with a smooth cone (produced by slow continuous extrusion of the fibre into the etching 
medium) was that most light comes out of the very tip, (diameter ~50 μm). When such a 
fibre was immersed into an absorptive fluid, the solution at the tip boiled and the end of 
the fibre disintegrated. It thus seems that the additional light reflections provided by the 
shoulders in a stepped tip are essential for efficient distribution of light to the sample. 

 
 
For low concentrations of the photosensitizer, additional uniformity of the light 
intensity  distribution  is  likely  to  be  obtained  by  using  an  NMR  tube  made  of  white-
coloured  glass,  which  would  scatter  the  escaping  light  back  into  the  active  region. 
Whitening commercial NMR tubes turned out to be a challenging task, as the process 
should not introduce any proton-containing and/or paramagnetic compounds and should 
not significantly alter the tube diameter. Attempts to use either liquid hydrofluoric acid 
or HF gas have so far been unsuccessful. Sandblasting the tube was also unsuccessful. 
The  option  of  using  an  NMR  tube  made  of  white  material  therefore  remains  to  be 
explored. 
 
 
4.4 Prolonged sample illumination: ways and consequences 

 
Although the photochemical reaction that gives rise to the photo-CIDNP effect 
in the fluorophenol/FMN system is cyclic, it is not perfectly cyclic. After a prolonged 
illumination period the photosensitizer does get photochemically reduced or destroyed, 
a phenomenon referred to as bleaching [136]. There are several techniques that aim to 
minimize the extent of photosensitizer degradation and to prolong the sample lifetime. 
One may attempt to oxidize the sensitizer back into the reactive form by using an added 
reagent  [48],  in  some  cases  just  by  letting  the  sample  consume  atmospheric  oxygen 
[137]. Alternatively, one may attempt to thoroughly purify the reagents to remove the 
undesired  side  reactions,  or  to  increase  the  photosensitizer  concentration  to  minimize 
depletion effects. 
  
Remarkably,  it  has  recently  been  demonstrated  that  lumiflavin,  which  is  a 
compound  with  the  same  chromophore  as  FMN,  shows  surprisingly  little  photo-
degradation  under  continuous  laser  illumination.  The  photo-degradation  rate  of 
lumiflavin was found by Holzer et al. [136] to be at least an order of magnitude smaller 
than that of FMN. Lumiflavin, however, is far less soluble in water than FMN, and its 
utility  is  therefore  limited.  Also,  in  the  experiments  reported  by  Holzer  et  al.  the 
solutions  did  not  contain  any  electron  donor,  and  therefore  the  results  may  be 
inapplicable to a photo-CIDNP system.  

 
Whatever means of prolonging the sample lifetime is used, one is always faced 
with  the  question  of  illumination  uniformity  and  the  extent  of  photosensitizer

degradation  in  different  parts  of  the  sample,  as  well  as  the  overall  rate  of  that 
degradation. All these parameters may be conveniently monitored using CIDNP-based 
imaging.  It  is  instructive  to  consider  the  time  dependence  of  the  CIDNP  image  of  a 
sample illuminated from above. Figure 4.8 shows the CIDNP polarization distribution 
in the Z-direction of the sample as a function of argon ion laser illumination time up to a 
total of 80 seconds. The photo-CIDNP images show the expected exponential intensity 
distribution  originating  from  Beer-Lambert’s  law.  However,  at  a  low  (0.2  mM)  FMN 
concentration a peculiar phenomenon emerges after several hundred flashes. Due to the 
higher light intensity in the  upper  parts  of  the  sample,  the  photosensitizer  degradation 
there  is  faster.  After  eight  hundred  scans  it  leads  to  a  non-uniform  photosensitizer 
concentration  distribution  that  compensates  the  irradiation  non-uniformity  and  the 
CIDNP  image  becomes  rectangular.  At  higher  concentrations  the  required  extent  of 
sensitizer  depletion  becomes  progressively  more  difficult  to  attain  and  we  see  only  a 
weak equilibration of this kind for the 0.8 mM FMN sample.

pulse (square cut fibre tip). The way the image is arranged the light is brought from the right. The two 
visible ridges on each of the image sequences are due to the Z-gradient coil arrangement. The interval 
between scans was 20 seconds to allow the sample to cool down before the next flash. 

 
Illumination  from  above,  therefore,  generates  reagent  concentration  gradients 
 
after  prolonged  illumination  periods.  The  consequences  of  this  may  vary  from  none 
whatsoever  for  first-order  photo-induced  kinetics  measurements  to  severe  data 
distortion in the case where second-order kinetics is monitored by recording the overall 
nuclear  magnetization  dynamics.  Photo-induced  radical  reactions  are  almost  never 
simple,  it  is  therefore  imperative  that  concentration  gradients  be  avoided.  This  puts  a

restriction  on  the  maximum  optical  density  of  the  sample  in  a  photo-CIDNP  kinetics 
measurement,  and  demands  that  the  initial  radical  concentration  be  considered  a 
distributed, rather than constant, quantity in the analysis of CIDNP kinetics.

result  of  photo-degradation  of  the  sensitizer.  After  a  total  of  80  seconds  of  irradiation 
less than 50% of the initial amplitude of the photo-CIDNP effect remains. Remarkably, 
the most densely coloured 0.8 mM FMN sample has the lowest CIDNP amplitude when 
irradiated from above and by far the highest amplitude when irradiated with a tapered 
fibre. In the latter case, after 800 flashes the reduction in the CIDNP amplitude is only 
about  50%.  Assuming  a  signal-to-noise  ratio  of  10-30  in  a  typical  one-scan  photo-
CIDNP  spectrum,  employing  a  tapered  fibre  tip  and  0.8  mM  concentration  of  FMN 
photosensitizer  should  allow  one  to  record  a  2D  1H-1H  or  1H-19F  CIDNP-COSY  or 
CIDNP-NOESY spectrum without resorting to sample re-injection techniques [48]. All 
2D  spectra  will,  however,  have  some  additional  line  broadening  caused  by  the 
attenuation of the CIDNP effect along the indirect dimension. This broadening may be 
reduced  by  performing  an  experiment  with  interleaved  acquisition,  when  the  indirect 
dimension increments precede phase cycling and signal accumulation increments. 
 
 
4.5 Square-cut vs. tapered illuminating tip: performance benchmarks 
 

Figures  4.9  and  4.10  have  shown  that,  as  well  as  providing  a  more  uniform 
sample illumination, the tapered fibre tip increases the observed amplitude of the photo-
CIDNP effect at high photosensitizer concentrations. The signal amplitude benchmark 
experiments described below show that for  a wide variety of both photosensitizer and 
target compound concentrations, the detected CIDNP magnitude with the tapered tip is 
higher or equal to that achieved by illumination with a square-cut tip. The photo-CIDNP 
experiments described below are of two types: 
 

Initial rate regime experiments, which employ light flashes much shorter than the 
longitudinal  relaxation  time  of  the  nuclei  in  question.  The  detected  photo-CIDNP 
the  photo-CIDNP 
amplitude 
magnetization  pumping  rate  and  is  to  a  first  approximation  independent  of  the 
longitudinal relaxation time. 

is  directly  proportional 

in  such  experiments 

to 

 
Asymptotic regime experiments which employ light flashes much longer than the 
longitudinal  relaxation  time  of  the  monitored  nucleus  and  represent  the  equilibrium 
nuclear polarisation resulting from a competition between magnetization pumping and 
relaxation processes. 

 
A  2D  grid  of  photo-CIDNP  experiments  spanning  the  active  compound 
concentration range of 1.0-6.0 mM and a photosensitizer concentration range of 0.2-1.4 
mM (OD = 2-10 cm–1) in the initial rate regime is shown on Figure 4.11. An 50-100% 
advantage  of  the  tapered  fibre  tip  is  apparent  for  the  entire  concentration  grid.  The 
advantage  becomes  less  apparent  in  the  asymptotic  regime  (Figure  4.12),  probably 
because  after  2  seconds  of  intense  irradiation  the  layer  of  solution  immediately  under

the square cut fibre tip bleaches out and becomes transparent so that more light reaches

Another prominent feature of initial regime plots on Figure 4.11 is the fact that 
the relative photo-CIDNP enhancement has an inverse dependence on the concentration 
of  the  active  compound.  This  agrees  very  well  with  the  kinetic  model  of  the  CW-
pumped photo-CIDNP effect, which suggests that even at much smaller concentrations 
of  the  active  compound  all  the  FMN  triplets  get  intercepted.  The  detected  CIDNP 
polarization in a CW irradiation experiment thus originates from a small sub-ensemble 
of a large pool of molecules and does not depend strongly on the size of this pool (see 
Figure 4.13 for the absolute detected magnitude data). Altering the concentration of the 
active  compound  thus  has  a  weak  effect  on  the  magnitude  of  photo-CIDNP 
magnetization,  but  increases  the  normalization  divisor.  A  1/C  or  similar  behaviour  is 
therefore  expected.  A  weak  dependence  of  the  absolute  detected  signal  magnitude  on 
the  concentration  of  the  active  compound  is  a  very  good  news,  meaning  that  high 
concentrations of the investigated compounds are unnecessary. This is important in the 
case of sparingly soluble, expensive or aggregating compounds. 

 

Chapter 4. Uniform illumination of optically dense NMR samples. 

79 
 
In the asymptotic regime (Figure 4.14) the enhancement becomes approximately 
proportional to the active compound concentration, and the normalized surface becomes 
flatter.  The  absolute  detected  intensity  plot  becomes  proportionally  ascending.  This  is 
again  consistent  with  the  kinetic  model,  because  under  a  steady  supply  of  the  active 
photosensitizer molecules the number of polarized molecules in the steady state linearly 
depends on the concentration.

4.6 Concluding remarks 
 
 
The  simplicity  and  efficiency  of  the  tapered  fibre  illumination  system  is  quite 
remarkable.  In  all  cases  the  tapered  fibre  irradiation  scheme  is  either  50-100%  better 
(short flashes) or approximately as good (long flashes) as irradiation from above. Given 
the  possibility  of  at  least  a  seven-fold  increase  in  the  photosensitizer  concentration 
compared to the traditional illumination from above and at least an order of magnitude

weaker temperature gradients due to greater surface area, the tapered fibre illumination 
scheme may in some cases (2D CIDNP experiments, very densely coloured samples) be 
highly advantageous. An example of application of the tapered fibre illumination will be 
given in Chapter 7, which describes photo-CIDNP experiments on a strongly coloured 
green  fluorescent  protein.  19F  CIDNP  experiments  on  this  protein  turned  out  to  be 
impossible to perform with the traditional illumination setup because the concentrations 
required to get any light into the active region were too low to permit signal detection. 
Utilizing  a  tapered  fibre  allowed  an  order  of  magnitude  increase  in  concentration, 
making the photo-CIDNP signal easily detectable.

Also  referred  to  as  tc5b,  Trp-cage  is  a  20-residue  proline-rich  amino  acid 
sequence, derived from the C-terminal fragment of the 39-residue exendin-4 peptide and 
stabilized by further mutations [138]. The Trp-cage folds extremely fast (4.1 μs, [139]) 
and  has  a  well-defined  hydrophobic  core  consisting  of  tryptophan  encaged  by  two 
prolines (Figure 5.1). From NMR and CD data it appears to be 85% folded in neutral 
aqueous  solution  at  20°C  and  shows  a  cooperative  melting  transition  at  315  K  [138]. 
Owing to its small size, Trp-cage is an ideal testing ground and calibration system for 
molecular dynamics and ab initio methods, with a number of works already published 
in this area [140-142]. Among the notable results is the fact that an AMBER force field 
folds  the  entire  structure  correctly  starting  from  the  fully  elongated  sequence,  even  in

implicit  water.  However,  the  melting  point  predicted  by  the  simulation  appears  to  be 
unphysically  high  [143].  The  Trp-cage  has  also  recently  been  used  to  investigate  the 
low  solvent  viscosity  limit  of  the  protein  folding  speed  [139].  Small  size  and  the 
presence  of  a  single  solvent-accessible  tyrosine  make  Trp-cage  a  convenient  testing 
ground  for  the  19F  photo-CIDNP  method  outlined  in  the  previous  chapters.  Specific 
questions that this small testing system is likely to answer are: 
 

 
Given  the  large  hyperfine  anisotropy  of  the  fluorine  nucleus  in  the 
intermediate  radicals,  is  there  any  dependence  of  the  observed  19F  photo-
CIDNP  effect  on  the  rotational  correlation  time,  perhaps  through  relaxation 
contribution to either geminate or escaped radical dynamics? 
 
 
Would  the  buried  tryptophan  residue  exhibit  any  photo-CIDNP  effect, 
either directly or through multi-staged electron transfer via the nearby tyrosine? 
 
 
Despite the unfavourable rotational correlation time in the folded state of 
this  peptide,  would  it  be  possible  to  detect  chemically  pumped  nuclear 
Overhauser effect from fluorine to the surrounding protons? 

Tyrosine was chosen as a site for the fluorine label placement for a number of 
reasons. Tyrosine has a much greater photostability compared to tryptophan, as well as 
much simpler spin system (see Chapters 2 and 3 for details). The fluorotyrosine/FMN 
photo-CIDNP  system  has  received  a  detailed  theoretical  and  experimental  treatment 
[52]. It is also much cheaper than the fluorinated tryptophans, especially in the racemic 
form. In the specific case of Trp-cage, fluorinating the tyrosine is also much less likely 
to destabilize the overall peptide fold, because the fluorine label is introduced into the 
peripheral tyrosine residue, rather than into the tryptophan core (Figure 5.1).

is  needed 

 
Fluorinated amino acids are toxic to bacteria [144], the simplest way to prepare a 
20-residue fluorotyrosinated peptide is therefore via solid phase synthesis, meaning that 
an  appropriately  protected  chemical  precursor 
fluorotyrosine 
incorporation. In the most popular case of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) protected 
peptide  synthesis  this  precursor  is  3-fluoro-N-FMOC-O-tBu-L-tyrosine,  which  is  not 
commercially available and therefore had to be synthesized.  
 
 
5.2 Solid phase peptide synthesis 
 
 
Before we proceed to the description of the protected precursor synthesis, the so-
called  FMOC  chemistry,  i.e.  the  fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl  amino  protecting  group 
based solid phase peptide synthesis will be briefly outlined here. The general scheme of 
solid  phase  peptide  synthesis  is  given  on  Figure  5.2.  The  functionalised  resin  denoted

with  a  blue  ball  is  usually  either  polystyrene  cross-linked  with  1%  divinylbenzene  or 
polyacrylamide-based copolymer. The resins may be functionalised with a wide variety 
of linker groups (usually TFA-cleavable, such as Wang linker [145]), serving as initial 
attachment points for the growing amino acid chain. All chemical steps are performed 
by passing a solution containing the necessary chemical through this resin.  

Figure 5.2. A general scheme of the solid phase peptide synthesis. 

 

After  the  first  amino  acid  is  attached  to  the  support,  the  following  elongation 
step is repeated until the necessary peptide chain has been prepared: the amino group is 
deprotected, then coupled with the pre-activated carbonyl group of the next amino acid. 
After the last amino group has been deprotected, the peptide is cleaved from the resin 
and all the side chain protecting groups are removed. 
 

A comprehensive list of resins, linkers and side chain protective groups is given, 
for example, in Novabiochem’s catalogue [146], together with a review of most popular 
solid phase chemistries.

FMOC-based  protection  is  an  example  of  the 
carbamate  protection  of  the  amino  group.  Carbamates 
may  be  prepared  by  either  treating  the  amine  with  an 
alkyl  chloroformate  under  basic  aqueous  conditions,  or 
by  an  alkyl  alcohol  activated  by  phosgene.  By 
delocalizing  the  lone  electron  pair  of  nitrogen,  the 
carbamate group deactivates nucleophilicity of the amino 
group,  also  becoming  itself  quite  stable  towards  the 
nucleophiles. The O-alkyl group of the carbamate may be 
chosen to allow mild and specific deprotection by means 
that  do  not  involve  nucleophilic  attack  on  the  carbonyl 
moiety [147]. 
 
FMOC  protection  was  developed  by  Carpino  et  al.  in  early  1970s  [148-151]. 
These  early  works  introduced  the  FMOC  protecting  group  using  fluorenylmethyl-
chloroformate (FMOC-Cl), a toxic, corrosive and lachrymatory substance. A substantial 
improvement  came  with  the  introduction  of  FMOC  N-succinimide  (FMOC-NSu),  a 
much  less  toxic  and  more  stable  compound  [152].  FMOC-NSu  is  also  superior  to 
FMOC-Cl,  in  that  it  does  not  produce  dipeptide  byproducts  for  amino  acids  with  less 
hindered side chains (Gly, Ala), and also causes less amino acid racemisation [153].

The original suggestion for the FMOC protecting group removal procedure was 
 
β-elimination  with  liquid  ammonia  at  –33°C  [148-151].  Some  years  later,  however,  it 
was found that a sufficiently selective cleavage may be performed at room temperature

OH groups of the side chains of serine, threonine and tyrosine amino acids are 
 
commonly  protected  by  converting  them  into  tert-butyl  ethers.  tBu  provides  excellent 
steric shielding of alcohols and can be easily removed in acidic conditions because of its 
propensity  to  form  a  tertiary  cation.  tBu  can  be  conveniently  placed  onto  an  alcohol 
using isobutylene gas and either Lewis or protic acid. Deprotection takes place rapidly 
and  irreversibly  upon  treatment  with  trifluoroacetic  or  hydrochloric  acid,  with  a 
formation of isobutylene gas. 

 
In FMOC-protected peptide synthesis it is not necessary to protect the carboxylic 
acid  group  of  the  amino  acid.  In  the  precursor  synthesis  described  below,  however,  it 
was  briefly  protected  to  avoid  formation  of  dipeptides  on  the  FMOC-  and  tBu-
protection  stages.  The  protection  method  chosen  was  conversion  of  the  carboxylic

Chapter 5. Fluorotyrosine-labelled Trp-cage protein. 

The  product  of  Stage  4  (overall  yield  42%,  structure  confirmed  by  1H  NMR 
spectroscopy)  was  sent  to  Professor  Niels  Andersen’s  group  at  the  University  of 
Washington  for  use  as  a  precursor  for  the  solid  phase  synthesis  of  3-fluorotyrosine-
labelled  Trp-cage  protein.  For  various  reasons,  only  6  mg  of  labelled  protein  became 
available, allowing only a limited number of experiments to be performed. 
 
 
5.4 Results and discussion 
 

Prior to the photo-CIDNP experiments, a number of common NMR spectra were 
recorded to characterise the protein. The aromatic part of the proton spectrum shown in 
Figure 5.6 appears to be very neat, with both fluorotyrosine and tryptophan spin systems 
clearly  resolved.  A  theoretical  spectrum  of  the  aromatic  protons  perfectly  fits  the 
experimental data with all the scalar couplings in the expected ranges.

aromatic region of the Trp-cage protein 1H NMR spectrum (1 mM protein in D2O, 1 scan, 
Gaussian pseudoecho window function). The difference in H(5) chemical shift of tyrosine 
(c.f.  Figure  2.25)  is  due  to  inductive  deshielding  by  a  closely  positioned  tryptophan 
aromatic  system.  In  tryptophan:  JH(7)-H(6)=8.2  Hz,  JH(4)-H(5)=7.8  Hz,  JH(6)-H(5)=7.0  Hz.  In 
fluorotyrosine:  JH(2)-H(6)=1.8  Hz,  JH(2)-F(2)=12.2  Hz,  JH(5)-F(2)=9.0  Hz,  JH(5)-H(6)=8.4  Hz.  The 
assignment  and  the  positive  sign  of  all  J-coupling  constants  were  confirmed  by  a  GIAO 
DFT B3LYP aug-cc-pVTZ-J ab initio calculation. 

 
The 19F spectrum however packs two surprises (Figure 5.7). First, there are two 
signals in the 19F NMR spectrum, characterised by significantly different line widths. If 
we assume that the peptide is pure (which seems to follow from the proton spectra, as 
well as LC-MS data sent by Professor Andersen’s group), the apparent signal doubling 
in  the  fluorine  spectrum  may  have  two  possible  explanations:  fluorotyrosine  ring-flip 
isomers (described in detail in Chapter 6) and proline isomers [154, 155]8. Both these 
phenomena are well known; they generate multiple structural subensembles and would 

                                                 
8What exactly is causing the observed  19F signal doubling – tyrosine ring-flip isomers, proline cis-trans 
isomers, or both – is presently a disputed question. An 15N-labelled sample is required to record the 15N-
1H HSQC spectrum and clear up the matter.

normally lead to several 19F signals with different relaxation behaviour. The other, and 
much more interesting, finding was that for the native state of the Trp-cage protein the 
19F  photo-CIDNP  effect  appears  to  have  changed  sign  (Figure  5.7,  right  panel,  c.f.

Since  the  electron  transfer  reaction  is  initiated  by  a  triplet  flavin  molecule  and 
the  recombination  products  are  observed,  the  μ  and  ε  factors  are  very  unlikely  to 
change. Introducing sufficient electronic structure perturbation so as to alter the sign of 
the  19F hyperfine coupling or shift the g-factor requires either hundreds of kJ per mole 
of energy (hyperfine coupling) or introduction of stronger spin-orbit coupling (g-factor). 
Either of these things is extremely unlikely to be caused by simply heating the system 
up by 15°C (Figure 5.8). The conclusion therefore is that there is a different mechanism 
at work here. The chief suspect is spin relaxation, since one of the obvious parameters 
to change significantly upon thermal and chemical unfolding is the rotational correlation 
time. Indeed, recording the photo-CIDNP spectra of individual 3-fluorotyrosine in 30% 
and 70% glycerol as a function of temperature reveals the same type of dependence with 
the change of sign at high viscosities (Figure 5.9).

As  such,  paramagnetic  relaxation  effects  in  CIDNP,  including  that  of  fluorine-
containing compounds, are nothing new [64, 65, 156-158]. Moreover, Overhauser-type 
processes are usually cited for most of the deviations from Kaptein’s rules observed in 
photo-CIDNP experiments. The problem, however, is that at the field of 14.1 Tesla the 
Redfield  theory  calculations  (described  in  Chapter  8)  with  cross-relaxation  models 
suggested by Adrian et al. [64, 65, 156] and later by Tsentalovich et al. [157, 159, 160] 
all lead to the values of the paramagnetic cross-relaxation rates that are far too small to 
have  any  influence  whatsoever  on  the  nanosecond-scale  geminate  radical  dynamics9. 
The fact that it is geminate 19F polarization which changes with the correlation time was 
established  from  direct  observation  of  geminate  polarization  as  a  function  of 
temperature  in  a  water-glycerol  solution  (Figure  5.10)  and  from  the  absence  of  19F 
escape cancellation demonstrated in Chapter 7 (Figure 7.6).  
                                                 
9This is a simple consequence of having a square of the electron Larmor frequency in the denominator of 
the spectral density J(ω ≠ 0) and lack of J(0) term in all of the longitudinal single- and multi-spin (cross-) 
relaxation rate expressions.

We  must  therefore  conclude  at  this  point  that  if  it  indeed  is  a  relaxation  effect 
 
that  is  responsible  for  this  sign  change,  it  must  be  more  complicated  than  the 
longitudinal  electron-nucleus  cross-relaxation  [157]  or  cross-correlation  [159,  160] 
suggested  in  the  earlier  studies.  Chapter  8  of  this  Thesis  is  devoted  entirely  to  further 
exploration  of  this  phenomenon,  which  turned  out  to  be  a  complex  transverse  cross-
correlated magnetization transfer process.

useful in structural studies of fluorinated proteins – the diamagnetic  19F-1H chemically

pumped nuclear Overhauser effect (CANOE). When the 19F photo-CIDNP enhancement 
is large, a strong and long-range 19F→1H NOE can potentially be observed for protons 
close to the 19F nucleus. A theoretical estimates of the 19F-1H cross-relaxation and DD-
CSA  cross-correlation  rates  between  F(3)  and  H(2)  in  the  aromatic  ring  of  3-
fluorotyrosine  amino  acid  using  Redfield

approximation is shown in Figure 5.11. The cross-relaxation and cross-correlation rates

Figure  5.12.  1H→19F  HOESY  spectra  of  1.0  mM  D2O  solution  of  fluorotyrosine-labelled  Trp-cage 
protein  in native, partially  destabilized  and  strongly destabilized  states. The 1D  spectra  are slices  taken 
through  points  of  maximum  signal  intensity.  Each  spectrum  took  over  24  hours  to  accumulate  and  a 
heavy (80 Hz Gaussian) window function was needed to extract anything out of the noise. 

 
Figure 5.11 displays a rather pessimistic prediction for the Trp-cage protein and 
its partially unfolded states, with the cross-relaxation rate being very close to the zero 
crossing  point  of  the  spectral  density  function  (Figure  5.11).  The  position  of  this  zero 
crossing  point  is  independent  of  the  number  of  protons  in  the  vicinity  of  the  fluorine 
nucleus and only depends on the effective correlation time. To add to the problem, the 
expected range of correlation times for the Trp-cage is located at the maximum of the 
DD-CSA cross-correlation rate, meaning that 19F magnetization will be strongly drained 
into unobservable multi-spin orders. The inverse cubic distance dependence of the DD-
CSA  cross-correlation  rate  means  that  protons  in  a  very  large  (3-5  Å)  radius  will 
contribute substantially to this process, likely increasing the rate shown in Figure 5.11

by about an order of magnitude. The chances of observing a detectable 19F→1H NOE in 
these  circumstances  are  at  best  very  slim,  even  if  we  assume  that  the  actual 
hydrodynamic  radii  will  be  slightly  larger  than  those  used  in  Figure  5.11  due  to 
molecular surface solvation. A heavier protein (e.g.  α-lactalbumin), which shows both 
higher 9F→1H NOE transfer rate and lower DD-CSA drain (Figure 5.11), is required to 
obtain practically useful data using this methodology. An alternative approach would be 
to use more viscous solvents and low temperatures, but this would take us away from 
the (experimentally preferable) near-physiological conditions. 

 
To assess the feasibility of 19F-1H CANOE experiments on the fluorotyrosinated 
Trp-cage  protein,  several  conventional  HOESY  [161,  162]  spectra  were  recorded 
(Figure  5.12).  The  specific  feature  of  the  19F  nucleus  in  proteins  is  extremely  fast 
transverse  relaxation,  which  short-circuits  frequency  labelling  and  coherence  transfer 
stages in most 2D experiments involving 19F. The only way to record a protein HOESY 
spectrum with fluorine in one of the dimensions is to make sure that 19F magnetization 
never  goes  into  the  transverse  plane  except  at  detection.  A  reverse  (1H→19F)  HOESY 
sequence has this property and was therefore recorded. 

 
As expected from the relaxation theory calculation (Figure 5.11), over 24 hours 
of pulsing and a very strong window function have only uncovered a trivial NOE from 
the  19F  nucleus  to  the  nearest  H(2)  proton  in  fluorotyrosine  (Figure  5.12).  The  native 
spectrum also has a very weak but detectable magnetization transfer from the H(5) of 
the nearby Trp6, methyl groups of Leu9, and possibly β-protons of Pro18 as well. Given 
that  the  native  state  has  a  near-zero  19F  photo-CIDNP  effect  (Figure  5.7)  and  the 
partially  unfolded  states  lack  detectable  Overhauser  effects  even  after  very  prolonged 
signal  accumulation,  it  seems  unreasonable  to  try  19F-1H  CANOE  experiments  on  the 
time 
Trp-cage 
dependence  of  the  19F-1H  cross-relaxation  rate 
(Figure  5.11)  suggests  that  a  heavier  fluorinated 
protein  will  likely  present  a  much  better  system 
for  a  study  using  chemically  pumped  19F-1H 
dipolar cross-relaxation.

The  last  thing  to  mention  about  the  Trp-

aromatic  ring  is  “encaged”  there  appears  to  be 
the 
enough  HOMO  density  available

apparent  contradiction  to  the  computed  geometric  solvent  accessibilities,  tryptophan 
shows  higher  photo-CIDNP  polarization  than  tyrosine.  This  (and  similar  observations 
made in Chapter 6 for the green fluorescent protein) has prompted the author to revisit 
the controversial relation between the solvent accessibility and the photo-CIDNP effect 
[46,  163]  and  propose  a  modification  (described  in  detail  in  Chapter  6),  in  which  the 
CIDNP-geometry  relation  is  based  on  amino  acid  HOMO  accessibility  to  the 
photosensitizer, rather than the accessibility of any particular atoms or groups. 

Figure  5.14.  Stereo  plot  of  the  HOMO  orbital  of  the  Trp-
cage  protein  (DFT  B3LYP/6-31G  using  NMR  structure

In  the  particular  case  of 
Trp-cage  the  observed  photo-
CIDNP  polarization  of  trypto-
phan  may  have  two  (likely  si-
multaneously  active)  causes. 
First, it is known that a signifi-
cant  sub-ensemble  exists  in  the 
pool  of  Trp-cage  molecules  in 
which tryptophan solvent expo-
sure  is  much  greater  than  the 
NMR  structure  (Figure  5.1) 
suggests.  The  reason  for  this  is 
that at room temperature Trp-cage is only ~85% folded [138]. The folding rate constant 
of (4 μs)-1 then implies an unfolding rate constant of about (23 μs)-1, meaning that the 
folding-unfolding equilibrium is very fast and allows tryptophan to participate in elec-
tron transfer. Second, even in the folded state the geometric accessibility of tryptophan 
HOMO  may  be  sufficient  for  electron  transfer  to  the  photosensitizer  to  occur  (Figure 
5.14). A study of triplet photosensitizer quenching by tyrosine-tryptophan dipeptide per-
formed  by  Morozova  et  al.  [164,  165],  as  well  as  an  earlier  study  on  photosensitizer 
quenching competition effects [57] have found that, all other things being equal, trypto-
phan has a higher rate of electron transfer to the photosensitizer than tyrosine, meaning 
that a lesser degree of solvent exposure might lead to a comparable photo-CIDNP effect 
amplitude observed in Figure 5.13. 

 
Overall, although the questions set out in the introduction to this Chapter have 
been  answered,  the  study  of  the  Trp-cage  protein  has  generated  further  questions. 
Specifically, the origin of the fluorine signal doubling is unclear, as is the cause of the 
sign  change  in  the  19F  photo-CIDNP  effect.  While  the  latter  question  is  dealt  with  in 
Chapter 8, the former is left for exploration by any interested party.

reen  fluorescent  protein  (GFP),  originally  obtained  from  the  jellyfish 
Aequorea  victoria,  is  remarkable  for  its  structural  stability,  nearly  100% 
fluorescence quantum yield and lack of cytotoxicity [166]. It is widely used 
as a reporter protein in biological and biochemical research, and is also interesting in its 
own right as a model system for photophysical [167] and protein folding studies [167-
170].  
 
The  238-residue  amino  acid  se-
 
quence of GFP folds into an 11-stranded β-
barrel  (Figure  1)  [171,  172]  and  undergoes 
an  autocatalytic  post-translational  cycliza-
tion  and  oxidation  around  residues  Ser65, 
Tyr66 and Gly67, forming an extended and 
rigidly  immobilized  conjugated  π-system  – 
the  chromophore  [167].  No  cofactors  are 
necessary for either formation or function of 
the chromophore, which is embedded in the 
interior  of  the  protein  [173].  In  the  native 
state, the chromophore is shielded from the 
bulk  solvent  and  rigidly  immobilized,  the 
latter  feature  is  thought  to  prevent  vi-
brational  relaxation  and  give  GFP  its  re-

markably  high  fluorescence  quantum  yield.  On  protein  denaturation,  the  chromophore 
remains chemically intact but the fluorescence is lost. This green fluorescence is, there-
fore, a sensitive probe of the state of the protein.

GFP has been extensively engineered to alter and improve its properties and to 
facilitate its use as a reporter of gene expression, for protein localisation, as a biosensor 
and  indicator  of  protein-protein  interactions.  To  be  fluorescent  in  these  different 
biological assays, GFP must be completely folded.  
 
 
Relatively  little  is  known  about  folding  of  GFP,  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo.  The 
most detailed study to date is a work by Kuwajima et al., who employed fluorescence 
and  far-UV  circular  dichroism  to  probe  phases  of  folding,  unfolding  and  refolding 
reactions.  Based  on  the  UV  and  CD  spectroscopic  data,  Kuwajima  et  al.  proposed  a 
folding model with several intermediate states [168]. The overall folding pattern appears 
to  be  quite  complex  and  further  studies  using  different  techniques  and  probes  are 
certainly necessary to obtain a complete understanding of GFP folding behaviour. 
 
 
Nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  spectroscopy  has  proven  to  be  a  powerful 
method  of  studying  structured,  partially  structured  and  denatured  states  of  proteins, 
including molten globules and kinetic intermediates [174]. In the cases where NMR can 
be  used,  it  provides  valuable  residue-specific  information  on  structure  and  dynamics 
and  therefore  complements  optical  techniques  such  as  fluorescence  and  circular 
dichroism  which  only  report  the  global  properties.  1H,  13C  and  15N  are  the  most 
commonly used nuclei. Quite recently, however, much progress has been made on the 
study of proteins using 19F NMR [175-177].  
 

 

 

Chapter 6. 19F NMR and photo-CIDNP study of green fluorescent protein. 

 97 

A  distinctive  feature  of  19F  NMR  spectroscopy  is  a  strong  chemical  shielding 
 
anisotropy (CSA) of the fluorine nucleus, which is sometimes as high as 100 ppm. The 
nuclear  relaxation  rate  due  to  the  CSA  is  quadratic  in  magnetic  induction,  and,  for  a 
protein of the size of GFP at 10-20 Tesla, the transverse 19F relaxation is dominated by 
the CSA term and is very fast. This leads to broad spectral lines (60-400 Hz) and lowers 
the  sensitivity.  Fast  transverse  relaxation  of  19F  also  short-circuits  magnetization 
transfer stages in all but a few 2D NMR sequences [178]. 
 

Despite  these  seemingly  formidable  difficulties,  19F  NMR  of  fluorine-labelled 
biological macromolecules is gaining popularity, the reason being that 19F nucleus has a 
large  chemical  shift  dispersion  and  its  chemical  shielding  is  very  sensitive  to  the 
changes  in  molecular  environment  [179].  For  example,  in  a  protein  containing  ten 
fluorinated tyrosines, one may generally expect that all ten will be resolved in the native 
state spectrum and that any structural transformation will be accompanied by significant 
changes in chemical shifts. Kinetic analysis of these changes can give direct information 
on  the  kinetics  of  the  structural  transformation  in  question  [177].    In  addition  to  the 
information obtained from chemical shifts, structural information can also be gathered 
from relaxation data. 19F relaxation behaviour is well understood and in principle allows 
extraction of local and global motion correlation times, order parameters and rotational 
diffusion tensors [178], which are useful indicators of the local mobility and stability of 
the macromolecule.

Another unusual property 
of  the  fluorine  nucleus,  namely 
the  large  19F  hyperfine  coupling

radicals,  makes  it  particularly

QuikChange kit from Strategene. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of 
the truncated GFP gene. Chromatography and mass-spectroscopy data indicate > 99% 
purity and > 95 % fluorotyrosine incorporation. On sample storage, very small amounts 
of free 3-fluorotyrosine are accumulated, most likely due to slow decomposition. This 
admixture proved advantageous during the initial stages of the assignment as a chemical 
shift reference signal. However, 3-fluorotyrosine was found to disrupt the photo-CIDNP 
experiments  as  it  preferentially  reacted  with  the  excited  FMN  photosensitizer.  It  was 
removed from the samples by dialysis prior to photo-CIDNP measurements. 

  
377 MHz  19F NMR measurements were performed on 1.0 mM protein samples 
in 10% D2O with PBS buffer at 300 K using a Bruker DRX400 spectrometer equipped 
with a 5 mm QNP probe. 19F chemical shifts were referenced to external TFA. 564 MHz 
19F  NMR  spectra  were  recorded  in  10%  D2O  with  PBS  buffer  at  300  K  on  a  Varian 
Inova  600  (14.1 Tesla)  NMR  spectrometer  equipped  with  a  5  mm  19F{1H}  z-gradient 
probe.  In  all  cases,  the  spectra  were  recorded  with  sufficient  sweep  width  to 
accommodate all signals without reflections. The acquisition time was set to longer than 
five times the reciprocal width of the narrowest signal. The hardware oversampling rate 
was set to the instrumental maximum. All FIDs were weighted by either an exponential 
or a Gaussian pseudoecho window function matched to the narrowest peak. For the line 
fitting analysis, the line positions were first determined by fitting a spectrum processed 
with a Gaussian pseudoecho window function, the resulting peak position list was then 
used for fitting the unfiltered spectrum to extract the line widths. The typical number of 
scans  in  the  19F  spectra  reported  herein  is  16384.  19F  photo-CIDNP  spectra  were 
recorded  in  pure  D2O  at  pH  6.0  (phosphate  buffer).  The  light  source  was  a  Spectra 
Physics  BeamLok  2080  argon  ion  laser,  operating  in  single-line  mode  at  5 W  output 
power  at  either  488  nm  or  514  nm  wavelength.  A  mechanical  shutter  (NM  Laser 
Products  LS200)  controlled  by  the  spectrometer  was  used  to  produce  100  ms  light 
pulses. The light was focused into a 6 m length of optical fibre (Newport F-MBE), using 
a Newport M-5X objective lens. The other end of the fibre was attached (via Newport

SMA  connectors)  to  a  2  m  section  of  the  same  fibre  whose  stepwise-tapered  tip 
(described  in  detail  in  Chapter  4  and  published  in  ref.  [180])  was  held  inside  a  5  mm 
NMR tube by a truncated Wilmad WGS 5BL coaxial insert. 

 
During  each  CIDNP  experiment,  the  sample  was  irradiated  for  100  ms  and 
subjected to a 90° radiofrequency pulse on 19F followed by immediate acquisition of the 
free  induction  decay.    After  application  of  a  shifted  Gaussian  window  function,  zero-
filling  and  Fourier  transformation,  the  spectra  were  analyzed  using  mixed  Lorentzian-
Gaussian line fitting. 

 

 
6.3 Theoretical framework 
 

The relaxation of 19F nuclei in GFP-sized molecules in solution occurs primarily 
due  to  rotational  modulation  of  two  anisotropic  interactions:  the  dipole-dipole 
interaction with nearby protons (DD mechanism) and the Zeeman interaction with the 
applied  magnetic  field  (chemical  shift  anisotropy,  or  CSA  mechanism).  A  relaxation 
theory  treatment  described  in  Chapter  1  results  in  the  following  expressions  for  the 
longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates of the fluorine nucleus:

It has relatively recently become possible to estimate values of the chemical shift 
tensor  anisotropy  parameter,  σΔ ,  from  ab  initio  calculations  [35].  Values  of  the 
anisotropy  of  the  19F  chemical  shielding  tensor  were  obtained  using  the  Gaussian03 
program [76] at three different levels of theory (Table 6.1). The most computationally 
expensive  method,  B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p),  is  a  general-purpose  technique  for 
chemical shift calculation that has been shown to provide reasonably accurate results for 
most  Period  II  elements;  the  CSGT  DFT  B3LYP/cc-pVDZ  method  is  the  one 
recommended by Tormena et al. [181] for accurate calculation of  13C chemical shifts. 
While, in general, one would expect a better estimate from a higher level method,  19F 
chemical  shift  calculations  are  known  to  disobey  this  rule  [120],  and  the  least 
computationally  expensive  GIAO  HF  /  6-311++G(2d,2p)  method  yields  values  of  the 
19F  chemical  shifts  that  are  superior  to  those  obtained  with  DFT  and  MP2  [35].  We 
therefore chose to use the GIAO HF value for the relaxation analysis. DFT methods are 
known to overestimate  19F shielding in fluorinated aromatics [120], something that we 
also see here. 
 
 
Once  σΔ   is  known,  measuring  relaxation  times  at  two  or  more  different 
magnetic fields allows extraction of the order parameters and the correlation times. It is 
particularly convenient to use T2 values for fluorinated proteins, both because of signal-
to-noise and degassing difficulties associated with T1 measurements, and because, for a

experiment,  since  accurate  estimates  of  T2  values  may  simply  be  obtained  from  line 
widths, assuming that the B0 field has been shimmed properly.

6.4 Results and discussion 
 
6.4.1 19F signal assignment and NMR data 

The  signal  assignment  was  achieved  using  a  combination  of  site-directed 
mutagenesis,  photo-CIDNP  methods  and  relaxation  theory  arguments.  Wild-type  GFP 
has ten tyrosine residues distributed throughout the structure (Figure 6.3). The 19F NMR 
spectrum of wild-type GFP shows a distinctive spread of  19F chemical shifts from −50 
to −60 ppm (Figure 6.4), as expected for a folded protein. To assign the 19F NMR spec-
trum, each of the ten tyrosine residues was mutated (by Dr. F. Khan, Cambridge Uni-
versity), one at a time, to phenylalanine. If the mutation does not significantly perturb 
the structure, the spectrum of each of the tyrosine mutants should lack one or two (dou-
bling  may  be  caused  by  ring-flip  isomers  described  below)  signals  compared  to  the 
spectrum of fully 19F-Tyr labelled wild-type protein. 

 
For Y92F, Y106F, Y143F, Y182F, the spectra clearly lacked one or two signals 
(Figure  6.4)  allowing  these  tyrosines  to  be  assigned  directly.  In  other  cases,  however, 
the mutation resulted in noticeable chemical shift changes (e.g. Y145F mutant, Figure 
6.4), most likely a result of small structural perturbations caused by the loss of the polar 
hydroxyl  group  on  mutation.  This  variation  in  the  signal  positions  between  mutants 
complicated the assignment of other tyrosine residues and, in some cases, lead to ambi-
guity. In these cases, the assignment was made on the basis of a  line-fitting analysis of 
both NMR and photo-CIDNP data for each mutant and, in some cases also from the re-
laxation theory arguments, as described in detail below. 

 
For Tyr66, which forms a part of the chromophore, the mutant protein (Y66F) 
could not be prepared in sufficient yield to acquire an NMR spectrum, most likely be-
cause the Tyr→Phe mutation in the chromophore results in the loss of the extensive hy-

the  protein.  However,  a  relaxation  the-
ory argument may be used to assign this 
residue.  After 
the  post-translational 
cyclization,  Tyr66  is  incorporated  into 
the chromophore, which is known to be 
a  very  rigidly  immobilized  structure.  It 
should therefore be expected that Tyr66

perturbations caused by mutation are 
substantial  around  58  ppm,  so  the 
signal  assignment  in  that  region 
should be treated with caution.

(Tyr92  and  Tyr143)  are  ob-
served  in  the  wild-type  GFP 
spectrum  (Figure  6.4)  with  the 
rightmost  pair  of  signals,  be-
longing  to  Tyr143,  displaying 
the  characteristic  behaviour: 
the relative intensity of the two

one  apparent  signal,  and  both 
signals  vanish  simultaneously 
when the residue is mutated (as 
in  the  Y143F  spectrum,  Figure

also demonstrated by Tyr92; in 
this  case,  however,  the  signals 
of the two isomers are substan-
tially  further  apart.  All  spectra 
also  contain  two  to  five  low-
intensity  peaks  of  variable  in-
tensity  which  are  likely  to  be  weakly  populated  rotamers  of  the  other  fluorotyrosine 
residues.

The signals from Tyr106 and Tyr145, which are also buried (Table 6.2), do not 
appear  to  be  split  to  such  a  degree10.  This  may  be  because  the  two  isomers  have 
identical chemical shifts, or because one isomer is highly favored over the other due to 
specific  packing  interactions  in  the  native  state.  Alternatively,  although  the  crystal 
structure  indicates  that  these  side-chains  are  buried  and  rigidly  held,  local  breathing 
motions may allow the isomers to interconvert rapidly. In any case, the splitting of the 
19F  signal  for  Tyr92  and  Tyr143  gives  a  sensitive  probe  of  the  local  conformational 
flexibility of the protein, which can be utilized in future unfolding/folding experiments. 
 
6.4.3 Relaxation analysis. 

It is known that the chromophore of GFP is a very rigidly immobilized structure 
[171,  172],  which  must  therefore  tumble  with  the  overall  molecular  correlation  time. 
Assuming  S2=1  for  the  chromophore  in  the  isotropic  overall  tumbling  approximation 
yields an overall molecular rotational correlation time of 17 ± 1 ns. The value obtained 
from the Stokes-Einstein equation is 16 ns; the experimental number is larger likely due 
to  the  elongated  shape  of  the  GFP  barrel.  Using  T2  values  measured  at  two  different 

                                                 
10There is, however, evidence of minor populations of other ring-flip isomers, as a number of unassigned 
low-intensity peaks are present in the spectrum.

field  strengths,  it  is  possible  to  solve  Equation  (6.7)  for  the  Lipari-Szabo  generalized 
order parameters (S2) [16, 26]. The values of (S2) for the ten fluorotyrosine residues of 
GFP  are  listed  in  Table  6.2.  Tyr66  was  assumed  above  to  be  immobile  and  the  other 
residues  show  different  extents  of  side-chain  mobility,  with  the  values  of  S2  in  good 
agreement with both CIDNP and the solvent accessibility data.

The  analysis  above  relies  on  the  isotropic  tumbling  approximation  of  the  GFP 
molecule. This is not strictly true, and an estimate using HYDRONMR program [182] 
and  the  X-ray  structure  of  GFP  results  in  the  D D⊥
  ratio  of  1.28,  meaning  that  the 
order  parameters  will  show  additional  dependence  on  the  orientation  of  the  chemical 
shielding tensor with respect to the diffusion tensor, which will in general be different 
for every residue. The resulting shift in the order parameter estimates may be as high as 
20%.  The  experimental  data  collected  in  the  present  work  is  not  sufficient  to  reliably 
estimate the rotational diffusion anisotropy and the angle between the diffusion tensor 
and the chemical shielding tensor. If and when such data becomes available, an analysis 
with the axial diffusion model would be very beneficial.

6.4.4 Photo-CIDNP experiments 

19F  photo-CIDNP  spectra  were  recorded  for  native  and  denatured  samples  of 
GFP including denatured states in acid (pH 1.5, 2.5 and 2.9) and 6 M GdnHCl.  These 
conditions  were  chosen  as  they  are  being  used  in  kinetic  refolding  experiments  [183]. 
Native  GFP  strongly  absorbs  at  the  usual  photo-CIDNP  excitation  wavelength  of  488 
nm, so the illumination system was modified to use fibre optics specifically designed to 
deal with optically dense samples (see Chapter 4 for a detailed description). It was also

same four peaks as expected. The spectrum 
of  Y151F,  however,  has  only  three  peaks,

been lost.

In  general,  it  is  considerably  more 
difficult 
to  obtain  detailed  structural 
information  on  the  denatured  states  of 
proteins  than  on  native  states.  When  the 
protein is unfolded, the chemically distinct 
19F  environments  in  the  native  state  are  lost,  collapsing  the  NMR  signals  into  a  peak 
with the same chemical shift as free 3-fluoro-tyrosine (Figure 6.8). The small signal on 
the  flank  of  this  large  peak    belongs  to  the  chromophore,  which  has  a  chemical  shift 
slightly  different  from  3-fluorotyrosine  due  to  the  chemical  modifications  associated 
with  chromophore  formation.  The  photo-CIDNP  spectra  of  denatured  GFP  at  pH  1.5, 
2.5  and  6  M  GdnHCl  are  also  very  similar,  and  exhibit  a  positive  enhancement.  In 
contrast, the pH 2.9 denatured state exhibits both a positive and negative polarization. 
As  the  19F  CIDNP  amplitude  is  related  to  the  correlation  time  (see  Chapter  8  for  the 
theoretical details), it would appear that there is some heterogeneity in the size/mobility 
of  the  molecule  at  this  pH.  This  could  be  due  to  two  structures  in  equilibrium,  one 
slightly more compact than the other. This is consistent with far-UV circular dichroism 
studies of the pH 2.9 denatured state which has considerably more secondary structure 
than the pH 1.5 or GdnHCl-unfolded state, and recent small-angle X-ray scattering data 
[183]. Residual structure, such as this, may be very important in the folding mechanism 
of  GFP,  effectively  restricting  conformational  space  at  a  very  early  stage  during  the 
folding process. It may also explain the results of folding measurements of GFP which 
suggest that folding is considerably faster from the pH 2.9 denatured state than from the 
pH 1.5 denatured state [183].

6.4.5 Solvent accessibility data 

 The  CIDNP  generation  mechanism 
involves an electron transfer from an amino 
acid  residue  to  the  excited  photosensitizer 
[184]. It has been recognized for a long time 
that  electron  transfer  is  only  possible  if  the 
amino  acid  residue  is  exposed  to  the  bulk 
solvent  [60,  185].  However,  attempts  to 
correlate the solvent accessibility of a given 
residue  with  the  observed  photo-CIDNP 
effect are not always totally successful [47]. 
In  the  case  of  GFP,  we  also  find  that  the 
amino 
not 
completely  predict  either  the  existence  of 
the  CIDNP  effect  or  its  amplitude  (Table 
6.2). A more detailed analysis of the solvent 
accessibility data, in which the accessibility 
of  the  HOMO  (from  which  the  electron 
transfer  actually  occurs)  is  used  rather  than 
the  solvent  accessibility  of  the  entire  side 
chain, was therefore performed.

calculated  using  the  web-based  GetArea 
program  [186]  and  the  crystal  structure 
(PDB code 1b9c) [187], using either 1.4 or 
3.0 Å as the radius of the solvent probe (to 
model accessibility by water and FMN, respectively). HOMO accessibilities were then 
computed  as  the  weighted  sum  of  atomic  accessibilities,  the  weights  corresponding  to 
the Mulliken HOMO density on each atom. 

  
The HOMO accessibility calculation produced a significant improvement in the 
prediction (Table 6.2). This finding is consistent with the fact that the electron transfer 
occurs  from  the  HOMO  of  a  solvent-exposed  tyrosine  to  the  excited  photosensitizer. 
This  can  be  illustrated  by  considering  Tyr143  versus  Tyr200.  Tyr143  has  the  same 
overall solvent accessibility as Tyr200, but only the latter shows a photo-CIDNP effect. 
Visual inspection of the residues in the crystal structure [187] shows that the region of 
Tyr143 which protrudes into the solvent is an unreactive backbone fragment that bears 
no  HOMO  electron  density,  whereas  it  is  the  aromatic  side  chain  that  is  exposed  for 
Tyr200. In this case, the computed HOMO accessibilities are completely consistent with 
the observed photo-CIDNP effects.

his chapter describes the design and operation of microsecond time-resolved 
photo-CIDNP hardware, designed to go with a commercial 600 MHz NMR 
spectrometer. A frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser is used as the light source, 
with  a  system  of  mirrors  or  prisms  to  route  light  to  the  NMR  sample  from  above, 
removing the need for NMR probe modifications. The experiment has been designed for 
a  shared  NMR  spectrometer  and  is  straightforward  and  inexpensive  to  assemble  and 
operate. 
 
 
7.1 Introduction 
 

The  two  main  experimental  techniques  for  photo-CIDNP  NMR  are  the 
continuous-wave  (CW)  and  time-resolved  methods.  CW  photo-CIDNP  is  generally 
more popular, not least because it is relatively straightforward to implement using UV 
lamps [188] or CW lasers together with fibre optics [75, 189]. Prolonged irradiation of 
NMR  samples  can  also  lead  to  strong  polarizations,  20-  to  50-fold  magnetization 
enhancements being quite common [52]. However, with illumination times of 50-5000 
ms, a CW photo-CIDNP experiment detects a time-averaged or steady state value of the 
photochemically  generated  magnetization,  which  yields  mechanistic  information,  but 
precludes kinetic studies. 

 
The  time-resolved  photo-CIDNP  technique,  using  a  pulsed  laser  as  the  light 
source, is best suited for exploring events on a microsecond to millisecond timescale in 
photoinduced  spin-selective  reactions  [57,  123,  127].  Time-resolved  photo-CIDNP 
experiments generally require light pulses much shorter than a microsecond and pulse 
energies  of  at  least  50  mJ.  The  resulting  incident  optical  power  densities  are 

Chapter 7. Microsecond time-resolved photo-CIDNP instrument.  

108 
 
incompatible with optical fibres and rule out the use of illumination schemes that have 
been developed in the more mainstream CW CIDNP and optical NMR field [72, 189].  

 
The  pioneering  work  by  Miller  and  Closs  [190]  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago 
described a time-resolved photo-CIDNP installation based on an electromagnet 60 MHz 
FT  NMR  spectrometer,  in  which  the  laser-  and  RF-control  electronics  were  custom-
made  and,  of  necessity,  rather  complex,  but  light  routing  was  straightforward  because 
the coil region of the probe was easily accessible from outside the magnet [191]. With 
the  introduction  of  superconducting  magnets  the  geometry  around  the  sample  volume 
has become much more constrained and difficult to access, such that sample irradiation 
can require, at the very least, “moving a few capacitors and drilling a few holes” in the 
probe  [47],  and  sometimes  also  sacrificing  one  of  the  probe  RF  coils  for 
synchronization  purposes  [192].  Hitherto,  the  method  of  choice  for  high-field  time-
resolved CIDNP studies has been to use a ≈5 mm diameter, cylindrical fused silica light 
guide passing off-axis through the body of the NMR probe, surmounted by a prism to 
bring  the  light  into  the  NMR  sample  from  the  side  through  a  window  in  the 
radiofrequency (RF) coil [45, 47, 193]. Another popular variant has the light guide on-
axis, bringing light from below into the sample contained in a flat-bottomed NMR tube. 
In  both  cases,  probe  hardware  modifications  are  inevitable  [47].  Routing  light  from 
below has also become more difficult because the sophisticated and fragile temperature-
control equipment needs to be relocated. Even if the latter can be achieved, the resulting 
axial  asymmetry  leads  to  field  homogeneity  distortions.  Moreover,  such  probe 
modifications  normally  invalidate  the  manufacturer’s  warranty.  With  cryoprobes 
gaining in popularity, it is becoming obvious that “do-it-yourself” probe modification is 
no longer an attractive option, except for highly specialized applications. 

 
The requirements for a modern time-resolved-CIDNP installation are: low cost, 
ease  of  assembly,  use  of  readily  available  commercial  components,  and  compatibility 
with multi-user high-field NMR spectrometers without the need for the modification of 
either  probes  or  RF  and  synchronization  circuitry.  All  of  this  has  gradually  become 
possible  in  recent  years  with  the  appearance  of  powerful  and  flexible  pulse 
programming languages and commercial lasers with built-in TTL synchronization lines, 
thus eliminating the need for constructing the more complicated parts of the Miller and 
Closs design [190]. 

 
This Chapter details the design and operation of a time-resolved photo-CIDNP 
system  based  on  a  frequency-tripled  Nd:YAG  laser  and  a  shared  600  MHz  NMR 
spectrometer  equipped  with  multi-user  probes  that  could  not  be  modified  to  permit 
sample  irradiation.  The  utility  of  the  approach  is  not  restricted  to  photo-CIDNP 
measurements,  other  applications  being  microsecond 
time-resolved  studies  of 
photochemical  reactions  [57,  127,  128]  and  photo-induced  transformations  of 
biomolecules [129-132].

7.2 Time-resolved CIDNP hardware: general considerations 
 
7.2.1 Light routing 

The main challenge in designing time-resolved CIDNP hardware is efficient and 
robust  light  routing.  To  preserve  the  magnetic  field  homogeneity,  the  laser  cannot  be 
brought  closer  to  the  superconducting  magnet  than  about  1.5  m.  The  entrance  to  the 
magnet  bore  is  2 m  or  more  above  floor-level,  and  the  sample,  in  the  centre  of  the 
magnet,  is  more  than  a  1  m  below  the  top  of  the  bore.  Modern  NMR  magnets  are 
suspended on air bearings, which are normally sufficiently stable to keep the horizontal 
drift  below  0.5  mm  a  day,  the  primary  cause  of  drift  being  changes  in  mass  due  to 
cryogen evaporation and refill. With access only available from above, there are several 
possible means of bringing the high-intensity pulsed laser light into the active region of 
the NMR probe. 
 

Fused  silica  light  pipes:  an  expensive  and  fragile  solution  that  would  require 
complete  removal  of  the  section  of  light  pipe  inside  the  magnet  bore  every  time  the 
sample  was  changed.  Silica  rods  decollimate  the  light  and  are  prone  to  gradual 
deterioration under intense UV light, forming cracks and “snow” along the beam path. 
Because of their rigidity, light pipes are an unattractive option since the vertical position 
of  the  magnet  may  change  by  as  much  as  a  few  centimetres  during  a  cryogen 
evaporation/refill cycle. 

 
Liquid light guides: in evaluating this option it was found that the decollimation 
and  optical  power  loss  (at  355  nm)  in  a  5  m  length  of  a  liquid  light  guide  is 
unacceptable. The fused silica terminal windows of the light guide suffer the same kind 
of damage as solid silica light pipes. Furthermore, the iron alloy ferrules on most liquid 
light  guides  are  incompatible  with  the  superconducting  magnet,  and  bespoke  ferrules 
tend to be expensive. Liquid light guides are also insufficiently flexible and quite heavy, 
making it difficult to position a sample tube attached to a light guide, inside the magnet 
bore. 

 
Optical  fibres  and  fibre  bundles:  attempts  to  send  a  10  ns,  100  mJ  UV  light 
pulse through a single optical fibre of any diameter usually result in destruction of the 
fibre. Fibre bundles terminated by large diameter fused silica rods were also considered, 
but were ruled out for cost reasons. 

 
Through-air  delivery  using  prisms  and/or  mirrors:  was  found  to  be  the  most 
satisfactory  and  cost-effective  option.  Three  fused  silica  prisms  or  355  nm  dichroic 
mirrors and one long-focus fused silica lens are required to route the light to the sample 
and reduce the beam diameter from 8 mm at the laser aperture to 4 mm at the sample 
entrance (see detailed description below).  

 

Chapter 7. Microsecond time-resolved photo-CIDNP instrument.

7.2.2 NMR sample considerations 
In  a  typical  photo-CIDNP  experiment  it  is  often  a  requirement  that  the  NMR 
 
sample is deoxygenated and isolated from the atmosphere [194]. Sample tubes can be 
kept air-tight by inserting a short, tightly fitting quartz rod, extending from the mouth of 
the  tube  to  the  coil  region,  which  acts  simultaneously  as  a  light  guide  [188]. 
Alternatively,  a  smaller  diameter  D2O-filled  NMR  tube  placed  inside  the  sample  tube 
can fulfil the same role. With the latter, it is difficult to reproduce the optical power that 
reached the sample due to variable light scattering at the water meniscus. Fused silica 
rods,  20  cm  long  and  4  mm  in  diameter,  with  optically  polished  ends  were  therefore 
preferred.  These  are  easily  replaced  if  substantial  photodamage  occurs,  and  with 
cylindrically shaped rods, the bubbles that tend to form between the solution layer and 
the lower end of the rod can be expelled without difficulty. 
 
7.2.3 Laser operation and synchronisation 
Pulsed gas (e.g. excimer) lasers — extensively used in the past for time-resolved 
 
CIDNP  experiments  [57,  190,  195]  —  are  convenient  in  that  they  do  not  require  an 
extended  warm-up  period  to  obtain  a  reproducible  output,  but  are  problematic  due  to 
their  poor  collimation  and  large  beam  cross-section.  Doped  YAG  lasers,  on  the 
contrary, have excellent collimation, but require an extended warm-up period with the 
necessity to flash the lamp repetitively to achieve a stable optical output. Since efficient 
light routing is the primary concern, a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser was chosen as 
the  light  source  in  the  hardware  described  below.  The  continuous  lamp  operation  and 
the  synchronization  of  the  Q-switch  and  the  RF  pulse  sequence  turned  out  to  be 
straightforward to implement in software. 
 
 
7.3 Hardware arrangement and operation 
 
 
The  time-resolved  photo-CIDNP  setup  described  in  this  Chapter  is  shown 
schematically  in  Figures  7.1  (block  diagram)  and  7.2  (geometric  layout).  The  Varian 
Inova 600 NMR spectrometer has five spare TTL lines that can be triggered from within 
the  pulse  sequence,  allowing  convenient  control  of  external  equipment.  The 
arrangement described here uses three lines, two of which trigger the lamp and the Q-
switch of the Nd:YAG laser; the third controls the optional safety interlock shutter. The 
required synchronization accuracy (~100 ns) is easily met by the built-in TTL lines of 
both spectrometer and laser. 
 

At 355 nm, prisms have the advantage of being less expensive than high-energy 
dichroic  mirrors,  but  each  prism  results  in  a  ~10%  optical  power  loss  due  to  light 
scattering at its surfaces. A prism-based light routing system almost inevitably has some 
stray reflections, which may be put to good use by placing a pre-biased fast photodiode 
into  the  path  of  the  stray  beam  and  using  the  resulting  signal  to  check  the  timing

accuracy  of  the  experiment.  The  pulse  widths  and  timings  specified  in  the  pulse 
sequence  were  found  to  be  reproduced  by  the  Inova  600  hardware  with  an  apparent 
accuracy of better than 10 ns. 
 

Figure 7.1 Block diagram of the time-resolved photo-CIDNP experiment using a frequency-tripled (355 
nm)  Nd:YAG  laser  and  sample  illumination  from  above  (to  avoid  the  necessity  for  NMR  probe 
modifications). The lamp, the Q-switch (Q) and the optional safety interlock shutter are controlled by the 
spectrometer via built-in TTL lines triggered from within the pulse sequence with event timing accuracy 
monitored  on  the  oscilloscope.  The  beam-delivery  system  comprises  frequency  mixing  crystals  (x3),  a 
long-focus  silica  lens  and  either  three 355 nm  dichroic  mirrors or  three fused  silica  prisms;  the  light  is 
directed to the NMR sample from above through the magnet bore. A 4 mm diameter fused silica rod is 
used both to guide light to the active region of the sample and to isolate the sample from the atmosphere. 

 

The beam delivery system may contain two or three deflectors (either prisms or 
mirrors).  The  two-prism  configuration  (without  Prism  B,  Figure  7.2),  requiring  the 
beam to be sent at an oblique angle across the room, was ruled out on safety grounds. A 
three-prism  configuration  was  therefore  implemented.  Prism  A  sends  the  beam 
vertically  towards  the  ceiling,  where  Prism  B  directs  it  horizontally,  well  above  eye-
level, to a position above the magnet. Prism C, mounted exactly above the centre of the 
magnet bore, sends the beam downwards towards the sample. Ideally, all prisms need 
X,Y,Z translation and θ,φ  rotation stages to facilitate alignment. 

 
Alignment of the beam with respect to the sample may be achieved by putting an 
empty NMR tube plus spinner in the magnet, removing the probe and maximizing the 
signal from a photodiode placed coaxially beneath the magnet. A frosted glass plate in 
the  beam  path  just  above  the  photodiode  ensures  that  it  reports  the  overall  light 
amplitude rather than accidental focussing spots generated by the bottom of the NMR 
tube.  The  minimum  requirements  for  the  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  three  prisms  or 
mirrors  are  given  in  Figure  7.2.  Once  the  arrangement  has  been  set  up,  only  Prism  C 
needs regular (every few days) adjustment, a consequence of small magnet movements 
arising  from  cryogen  evaporation.  Seasonal  changes  in  the  geometry  of  the  building

may  occasionally  (once  every  few 
months) make it necessary to adjust 
Prisms A and B. It is convenient to 
monitor  the  beam  position  at  the 
sample  entrance  using  a  paper 
collar placed around the quartz rod. 
Burn  marks  on  the  collar  indicate

experiment. Ideally, all three deflectors (prisms or mirrors) 
should have full rotation and translation stages to facilitate 
alignment  (minimum  requirements  for  the  degrees  of 
freedom are shown in the picture). 

 
The  lens  (at  least  5  m  focal 
length  was  found  to  be  required  in 
be  mounted 
practice)  may 
anywhere along the beam path, the 
most  convenient  location  being  the 
optical table. Care must be taken to 
avoid focussing the beam to a point 
anywhere along its trajectory. If the 
beam  diameter  is  reduced  below  3 
mm, snow-like lesions usually form 
the  fused  silica  optical 
within 
components, resulting in a degraded performance. The beam must also pass far enough 
from  the  volume  accessible  to  spectrometer  users  to  comply  with  safety  regulations, 
which  have  also  imposed  a  need  to  black-out  the  windows  of  the  spectrometer  room 
with opaque material.  
 
 
From the actual experience, acceptable magnetic field homogeneity can only be 
achieved if the lower end of the quartz rod is positioned at least 1 mm (up to 3 mm for 
very high resolution work) above the top of the receiver coil. This means that there is an 
absorptive  layer  of  solution  between  the  tip  of  the  rod  and  the  active  region  which 
attenuates  the  light,  To  maximize  the  sensitivity,  the  sample  concentration  would 
normally be adjusted for maximum light utilization, as outlined below. 
 

Assuming that the laser light comes uniformly from above, the amount of laser 

light absorbed in the active NMR sample volume is:

where  c  is the photosensitizer concentration,  l  is the coil length,  d  is the height of the

light  emerging  from  the  quartz  rod  and  ε  is  the  extinction  coefficient  of  the 
photosensitizer.  Finding  the  maximum  of  Iabs  with  respect  to  the  photosensitizer

gradients  were  used.  The  degree  of  suppression  of  unwanted  NMR  signals  can  be 
improved by using composite 90° pulses designed to minimize residual z-magnetization 
[12].  The  suppression  sequence  is  followed  by  a  lamp  flash  and,  after  a  population 
inversion period (labelled 
piτ , typically 150-180 μs), the Q-switch is triggered. The light 
pulse (5-10 ns) follows after about 50 ns, the time taken for the Q-switch to respond to

during which the photochemical reaction proceeds. The magnetization is then sampled 
by the RF pulse, which must be as short as possible (for the best time-resolution) and at 
the  same  time  as  close  as  possible  to  90°  (for  optimum  sensitivity).  A  reasonable 
compromise for a typical photo-CIDNP experiment is a 1.0 μs observation pulse at full 
available  (or  permissible,  depending  on  the  probe  capacitor  damage  threshold)  RF 
amplifier  power.  Given  sufficient  signal-to-noise  ratio,  the  time  resolution  can  be 
increased by deconvolution or iterative reconvolution [196]. 

 

 
While Figure 7.4 represents all the essential parts of the pulse sequence for time-
resolved  photo-CIDNP,  it  is  important  to  realise  that  commercial  pulse  sequence  pro-
gramming  languages  contain  multiple  “hidden”  (but  well-documented)  delays  in  their 
pulse statements. These may be as large as several tens of microseconds and may be dif-
ferent  for  different  amplifiers,  probes  and  nuclei.  This  means  that  all  the  time-critical 
statements should be coded explicitly to avoid ambiguities. In particular, the amplifier 
unblanking delay which precedes the RF pulse must be constant to ensure that the pulse 
power is stable. The length of this period for modern amplifiers is about 10 μs, meaning 
that  when  the  τ  delay  passes  the  10  μs  mark,  the  unblanking  delay  and  the  preceding 
Nd:YAG population inversion delay need to be appropriately reordered in the software. 
 
 
7.5 Examples 
 

Examples of the magnetokinetic data and time-resolved CIDNP spectra recorded 
with the pulse sequence of Figure 7.4 are shown in Figures 7.5-7.7. After the laser flash, 
the  geminate  radical  pair  spin-sorting  process  is  finished  in  the  first  few  hundred 
nanoseconds. The detected magnetization dynamics is therefore due to the magnetic and 
chemical  transformations  in  those  radicals  that  have  escaped  the  primary  cage 
recombination  [41].  The  particular  case  of  a  dye-sensitized  pulsed  photo-CIDNP 
experiment  has  been  treated  by  Vollenweider  and  Fischer  [43,  44]  who  suggested  the 
following  system  of  equations  to  describe  the  kinetics  of  the  escaped  radicals  and  the 
associated nuclear polarizations:

The  magnetization  dynamics  for  the  4-fluorophenol/FMN  reaction  (Figure  7.6)

(7.4). The initial sharp rise of both proton and fluorine signals is due to magnetization 
generation  in  F-pairs  [41].  It  is  followed  by  either  a  plateau  (fluorine)  or  partial  bulk 
recombination cancellation (protons). The lack of magnetization cancellation in the case 
of the 19F nuclei is due to their extremely efficient spin-lattice relaxation in the phenoxyl 
radical caused by the large hyperfine coupling anisotropy [199]. Fitting Equations (7.4) 
to these data results in proton and fluorine T1 values of 56 μs and 0.13 μs respectively. 
Such  parameters  would  be  difficult  to  measure  by  other  means  for  such  a  short-lived 
radical [52]. 

 

Figure 7.7 shows the aromatic region of the 600 MHz  1H photo-CIDNP (A, B) 
and  NMR  (C)  spectra  obtained  for  calcium-depleted  bovine  α-lactalbumin  (1.5  mM) 
with FMN photosensitizer (80 μM) in the presence of 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer 
at  pH  7.7  (in  D2O,  uncorrected  for  deuterium  isotope  effect).  In  the  case  of  the  time-
resolved  spectrum  (Figure  7.7A)  the  magnetization  was  sampled  and  acquired 
immediately  after  the  light  pulse  to  avoid  secondary  out-of-cage  photochemical 
reactions  [41]  and  so  to  ensure  that  only  geminate  CIDNP  is  present  [123,  163].  This 
geminate  polarization  is  directly  related  to  the  accessibility  to  the  bulk  solvent  of  the 
highest occupied molecular orbital of the aromatic amino acid residue and in principle 
allows a quantitative interpretation of CIDNP intensities in terms of side-chain solvent 
accessibilities.  This  would  be  difficult  to  do  with  steady-state  CIDNP  (Figure  7.7B) 
because of distortions caused by the secondary magnetization dynamics (an example of 
which  is  given  in  Figure  7.6)  and  diamagnetic  cross-relaxation  occurring  on  the 
timescale of the steady-state photo-CIDNP experiment. As one can see from comparing 
Figures 7.7A and 7.7B, the secondary processes introduce significant intensity changes 
and preclude simple quantitative analysis. The conclusion in this particular case is that 
the  Trp118,  His68  and  Tyr18  residues  are  sufficiently  exposed  to  the  solvent  for 
electron  transfer  (Tyr,  Trp)  or  hydrogen  atom  transfer  (His)  to  occur  to  the 
photosensitizer,  with  a  rather  low  solvent  exposure  for  Tyr18.  A  consideration  of 
solvent  accessibilities  based  on  the  steady-state  photo-CIDNP  spectrum  (Figure  7.7B) 
would have overestimated the accessibility of Tyr18 and strongly underestimated that of 
Trp118. Another notable phenomenon which is absent from the CW CIDNP spectrum is 
the  fact  that  the  H(7)  proton  of  the  tryptophan  aromatic  ring  (see  Figure  2.2  for  the 
numbering scheme)  shows a substantial geminate CIDNP polarization, indicating that, 
contrary  to  PCM  solvent  ab  initio  calculations  of  tryptophan  radicals  [199]  and  in 
agreement with in situ protein EPR data [200], H(7) does have a hyperfine coupling of 
at  least  0.3  mT  in  the  intermediate  tryptophan  radicals  of  a  protein/FMN  reaction 
system.

Relaxation processes in the 
high-field 19F CIDNP 

 
 
 
 
 

8.1 Introduction 
 

The  unexpected  correlation  time  dependence  of  the  19F  photo-CIDNP  phase 
observed  in  the  protein  experiments  and  high-viscosity  solvent  experiments  on  small 
molecules (Chapters 5 and 6) appears to have a complex and historically controversial 
explanation,  mostly  revolving  around  dipolar  relaxation  processes  such  as  the 
Overhauser  effect.  A  number  of  researchers  in  the  past  have  noticed  the  relaxation 
contribution  to  the  high-field  CIDNP  of  Period  II  elements,  manifested  either  at  high 
viscosities, or for very long-lived radicals in non-viscous solvents [201] and attributed it 
to  relaxation  processes.  Fluorine  with  its  large  hyperfine  coupling  has  been  cited  as  a 
classical  example  of  Overhauser  effect-driven  CIDNP,  as  demonstrated  by  Adrian  in 
1971-1979 [64, 65, 156, 202, 203]. 

the 

[64], 

analyzing 

 
From  the  height  of  our  current  understanding  of  the  spin  dynamics  underlying 
the  photo-CIDNP  effect,  however,  the  phenomena  observed  by  Adrian  and  others 
appear less clear than they seemed to be back in the 1970s. For example, Adrian’s 1974 
paper 
experimental  work  on  1-fluoro-4-[2-(4-fluoro-
phenyl)ethyl]benzene  (p,p-difluorobibenzyl)  [66],  reports  detection  of  only  19F 
polarization,  whereas,  according  to  the  EPR  hyperfine  coupling  data,  the  proton 
polarization should also have been observed. Fluorine seemed to be special, and Adrian 
had  attributed  this  to  cross-relaxation  caused  by  the  large  HFC  anisotropy  of  the 
fluorine nucleus. My present-day calculation based on Equations (1.13) and (1.25), 60 
MHz (proton frequency) magnetic field, ab initio 19F hyperfine coupling anisotropy and 
a more realistic τc = 10−10 s yielded the electron-19F cross-relaxation rate of 4×104 s−1. 
This is too slow to be manifested in either nanosecond-scale geminate or microsecond-
scale escape dynamics, even more so if we note that the lower bound (electron relaxes 
through  mechanisms  other  than  dipolar  as  well)  on  the  electron  relaxation  rate, 

Chapter 8. Relaxation processes in the high-field 19F photo-CIDNP.  

120 
 
computed  with  the  same  parameters,  is  2×105  s−1.  The  correct  explanation,  which 
Adrian does mention as an alternative, comes from the consideration of recombination 
and  exchange  cancellation  described  by  Equations  (1.50)  and  demonstrated  in  Figure 
7.6,  which  is  complete  for  the  slowly  relaxing  protons  (theoretical  T1  =  32  μs)  and 
absent for the much faster relaxing fluorine (theoretical T1 = 0.07 μs). Thus, while the 
dipolar  interaction  does  of  course  dominate  the  self-relaxation  behaviour  of  the 
experimental system described in [64] and [66], it is unlikely that cross-relaxation in the 
intermediate radicals occurs to any significant extent. 

 
A further investigation of the matter by Adrian and co-workers [65] has proven, 
this  time  convincingly,  that  at  low  magnetic  field  (B0  <  20  MHz)  the  Overhauser 
mechanism  does  contribute  to  the  generation  of  photo-CIDNP  polarization  of  the 
fluorine  nuclei.  At  higher  fields,  the  Overhauser  effect  can  still  be  detected  if  the 
lifetime of the intermediate radicals is prolonged beyond several tens of microseconds, 
as it happens in the system reported by Roth et al. [69]. 
 

A  number  of  later  works  have  also  found  or  suspected  an  Overhauser  effect 
contribution to the CIDNP or CIDEP generation. Specifically, the 1992 paper by Borbat 
et  al.  argued  that  CIDEP  swap  from  E/A  to  A/E  pattern  is  likely  caused  by  cross-
relaxation  with  the  nucleus  at  high  viscosities  [204].  Theoretical  works  describing  the 
longitudinal  dipolar  cross-relaxation  [157,  160]  and  longitudinal  dipole-Δg  cross-
correlation  [159,  160]  mechanism  of  CIDNP  formation  have  been  published  by 
Tsentalovich and co-workers. 

 
Some  cold  water  had  also  been  poured  onto  the  Overhauser  CIDNP  idea,  for 
example by Batchelor and Fischer [205], who reported that the earlier studies on radical 
photolysis CIDEP had incorrectly ascribed certain phenomena to cross-relaxation. After 
investigating unexpected CIDEP patterns, Valyaev et al. have ruled out the Overhauser 
mechanism  on  the  grounds  of  it  being  too  slow  at  the  conditions  of  their  experiments 
[158]. What exactly caused those patterns is still unclear. 
 
 
In summary, it is well established that at fields lower than about 20 MHz (proton 
frequency)  the  electron  does  cross-relax  with  the  nucleus  during  the  lifetime  of  the 
radical pair, provided the HFC anisotropy is large enough. Why similar things appear to 
happen  at  higher  fields  as  well,  is  a  much  less  investigated  question.  A  very  simple 
calculation shows that all the longitudinal cross-relaxation rates in an electron-nucleus 
spin  system  contain  the  square  of  the  electron  Larmor  frequency  in  their  common 
denominator. At a 600 MHz magnetic field all these rates become too small and cannot 
exert  any  influence  on  the  nano-  to  microsecond-scale  dynamics  of  the  photo-CIDNP 
effect  generation.  However,  Nature  seems  to  think  otherwise,  and  the  author  of  this 
work has had the questionable luck of encountering a number of these mysterious cases 
of  strong-field  relaxation  effects  (Chapters  5  and  6)  and  therefore  embarked  on  a 
detailed theoretical investigation.

8.2 Relaxation analysis 
 
8.2.1 Theoretical setup 

First of all, let us show that the existing models of Overhauser CIDNP all agree 
that it cannot take place at 600 MHz. We will start by performing the relaxation theory 
analysis  of  the  three-spin  system  comprising  two  electrons  with  anisotropic  g-tensors 
and a nucleus with an anisotropic hyperfine coupling to one of the electrons. Due care 
will be taken to account for the cross-correlation between the HFC tensor and one of the 
g-tensors.  This  model  represents  a  radical  pair  in  which  one  of  the  radicals  is 
conformationally  rigid  and  contains  a  magnetic  nucleus.  The  ab  initio  calculation  of 
hyperfine  couplings  in  the  3-fluorotyrosyl  radical  (Chapter  2)  shows  that  the  one-
nucleus approximation is sufficiently good, because the fluorine hyperfine coupling in 
the tyrosyl radical is by far the largest one and dominates the rest. 

 
The algebraic core of the Bloch-Redfield-Wangsness relaxation theory, which is 
used in the treatment below, was described in detail in Chapter 1. The spin Hamiltonian 
of our system has the following form:

in which the first and the second term describe the anisotropic Zeeman interactions of 
the  two  electrons  with  the  external  magnetic  field.  The  third  term  accounts  for  the 
nuclear  Zeeman  interaction.  The  anisotropy  of  the  nuclear  shielding  tensor  is  of  the 
order  of  kHz  and  may  be  neglected.  The  last  term  describes  the  anisotropic  electron-
nucleus  hyperfine  interaction.  After  applying  the  transformation  (1.22),  the  time 
dependence of the Hamiltonian (7.6) is condensed into two sets of Wigner coefficients:

Despite its complicated appearance, this is in fact the form most suitable for symbolic 
processing,  because  the  pairwise  correlation  functions  for  the  Wigner  coefficients  are 
known.  Let  us  consider  the  expression  (7.7)  term  by  term  to  reveal  its  uncanny 
simplicity. 
 
The first three terms describe the modulation of the spin system energy caused 
 
by the overall molecular rotation of the first radical. The axiality and rhombicity of the

and expression (1.23) is used to describe rotations of the spherical tensor operators. The 
molecular  rotation  takes  place  in  the  physical  space,  meaning  that  it  is  the  energy 
coupling  between  the  spin  and  the  magnetic  field  that  is  modulated,  while  the  basis 
tensors operating in the spin space remain intact. Because the two radicals are assumed 
to  have  moved  sufficiently  far  apart  to  behave  independently,  the  rotational  functions

the relative orientation of the hyperfine and g-tensor of the first radical. The expression 
(7.7)  is  valid  for  the  general  case  of  rhombic  interaction  tensors.  In  practical 
calculations  we  shall  assume  them  to  be  axial  and  therefore  only  use  one  angle  θ  to 
define their mutual orientation.

Because  the  g-tensor  of  the  first  electron  and  the  rotated  HFC  tensor  share  the 
same set of overall molecular rotation functions, the cross-correlation between the two 
anisotropies  will  be  correctly  accounted  for.  As  we  shall  see  below,  it  is  this  cross-
correlation  that  is  actually  causing  the  unexpected  CIDNP  phase  change  observed  in 
Chapters 5 and 6.

The other electron, which is assumed to have no significant hyperfine couplings 
to  its  nuclei,  is  independent  and  has  its  own  rotational  functions.  Because  it  is  not 
coupled to the other electron and its nucleus in any way, the relaxation theory problem 
is  a  direct  product  of  the  electron-nucleus  problem  and  single  electron  problem,  in 
which  the  latter  relaxes  through  its  own  g-tensor  anisotropy  only.  The  relaxation 
superoperator of such system is a sum of relaxation superoperators of the two uncoupled 
and uncorrelated subsystems. It may be rigorously proven that for any multi-spin order 
involving both subsystems, the relaxation rate is just the sum of the relaxation rates of 
the constituent spin orders in the individual subsystems. 
 
 
To sum up, we have an electron-nucleus two-spin system with cross-correlated 
HFC  and  g-tensor  anisotropies,  as  well  as  an  independent  single-electron  system  that 
relaxes  due  to  the  anisotropy  of  its  own  g-tensor.  Both  these  systems  are  fairly 
straightforward to treat if Mathematica is employed to deal with the notationally bulky 
Hamiltonian (7.7). Once implemented, this construction permits the calculation of any 
relaxation  property  of  our  spin  system  that  falls  within  the  applicability  range  of  the 
Redfield theory. 
 
8.2.2 Existing models 

The simplest model including dipolar cross-relaxation in an intermediate radical 
was proposed by Adrian and co-workers [65]. It only considers populations (neglecting 
coherences) and includes all the pathways shown in Figure 8.1.

modifications, from reference [65]. 

It is easy to see that Adrian’s model is the classical 4-level population dynamics 
model. It is presently used in many textbooks to discuss the origins of NOE and DNP 
effects.  It  includes  single-quantum  transitions,  corresponding  to  a  single  spin  flip, 
double-quantum  (sometimes  called  flip-flip)  and  zero-quantum  (flip-flop)  transitions. 
The latter two are assumed to be caused by the rotational and translational modulation 
of the hyperfine coupling.

In  the  case  of  the  3-fluorotyrosyl  radical  both  of  these  parameters  may  be 
computed  ab  initio  (Chapter  2),  the  resulting  values  (angular  frequency  units)  are  
Δg = 1.32×1010, ΔA = 2.75×109, with the θ = 90° angle between the principal axes of 
hyperfine and g-tensor. The computed hyperfine coupling anisotropy may be considered 
very accurate, as Chapter 2 demonstrates; the computed g-tensor anisotropy on the other 
hand should be treated as approximate with deviations from the true value possibly as 
large as ±30%.  
 
The theoretical transition rates (7.9) for the case of the 3-fluorotyrosyl radical at 
a  14.1  Tesla  magnetic  field  are  plotted  against the correlation time in Figure 8.2. It is 
obvious  that  within  the  entire  range  of  experimentally  available  correlation  times  the 
electron-nucleus cross-relaxation rates W0 and W2 are too small to exert any influence 
whatsoever on the microsecond-scale radical spin dynamics – a consequence of having 
a  square  of  the  electron  frequency  in  the  spectral  density  denominators  in  Equations 
(7.9). Although the nuclear relaxation rate Wn appears to be sufficiently high, it does not

Thus,  Adrian’s  relaxation  model  is  unable  to  describe  the  correlation  time 
dependence  of  19F  photo-CIDNP  effect  observed  in  Chapters  5  and  6.  Specifically,  at 
the  magnetic  field  of  14.1  Tesla  all  the  predicted  dipolar  cross-relaxation  rates,  even

accounted for, are too small to be 
active  on  the  timescale  of  the 
radical  pair  evolution.  If  we 
decide  to  continue  exploring  the 
it 
relaxation  hypothesis, 
appears  that  restricting  oneself  to 
the  populations  and  neglecting 
the evolution of multi-spin orders 
and  coherences  is  not  a  good 
approximation.

from 
Adrian’s  description  of  Over-

co-workers 
and 
Tsentalovich 
[157,  159,  160],  who  explicitly

treatment,  thereby  expanding  the 
number  of  spin  states  that  are 
properly  accounted  for  in  the 
model.  At  600  MHz  however, 
their  treatment  suffers  from  the 
same critical fallacy as Adrian’s – 
actual  calculations  lead  to  the 
values of the rates that are far too 
small  to  be  of  any  influence  on 
the  microsecond 
scale 
(Figure 8.3, all the other rates are 
linear  combinations  of  those  in 
Figure  8.2).  Model  fitting  to  the 
experimental data pulls out cross-
relaxation rates that are incompatible with the theory [159]. All the theoretical rates still 
contain the square of the electron Zeeman frequency in the common denominator and 
therefore are small at the 14.1 Tesla magnetic field.

(proton frequency), using ab initio values of hyperfine and 
g-tensor anisotropy.

The  algebraic  complexity  of  the  expressions  reported  by  Tsentalovich  et  al. 
seems  to  have  deterred  further  attempts  to  model  the  experimentally  detected 
dependence of the high-field CIDNP on the correlation time, and no further studies have 
emerged that would deal with the case, even though the community is well aware of the 
fact that the high-field limit of the current theories is zero.

8.2.3 Proposed solution 
Seeing that prior research 
 
the  problem  has  only 
on 
underlined  its  complexity,  the 
author  decided  to  take  a  brute 
force option, namely, to compute 
a  complete 
(4096  elements) 
symbolic  relaxation  matrix  for 
system  under 
three-spin 
the 
consideration  using 
symbolic 
processing  software  he  recently 
developed11,  and  perform 
the 
spin  dynamics  calculation  in  the 
complete  operator  space,  inclu-
transverse  magnetization 
ding 
and coherence operators. If the correlation time dependence of the high-field geminate 
19F  photo-CIDNP  is  predicted,  one  can  then  try  to  find  the  relaxation  pathway 
responsible. 
 
 
If  all  the  elements  in  a  64×64  relaxation  superoperator  were  non-zero,  the 
problem  would  have  been  formidable  even  to  Mathematica.  Fortunately  only  a  few 
elements are non-zero and use can be made of the above mentioned fact that one radical 
relaxes independently from the other, even though they share a two-electron spin order. 
All  the  non-zero  auto-  and  cross-relaxation  rates  in  the  spin  system  of  the  fluorine-
containing radical are reported in Tables 8.1 and 8.2. The expressions for the relaxation 
of the second radical may be obtained by setting ΔA=0. 
 

Figure  8.3.  Correlation 
the 
longitudinal  dipole-Δg  cross-correlation  rate  for  the  3-
fluorotyrosine  radical  at  a  magnetic  field  of  600  MHz 
(proton frequency), using ab initio values of hyperfine and 
g-tensor anisotropy. 

 
While the Tables 8.1 and 8.2 contain complete information about the relaxation 
of the two electrons and the nucleus (at least so far as the Redfield theory goes), they are 
uninformative  to  the  naked  eye.  That  is  expected,  since  we  are  looking  at  the  rather 
4⊗ -dimensional observable space. Fortunately, there are 
complicated evolution in a 16
disjoint subspaces in the 16-dimensional space, four of them to be exact, and we can use 
the graphical representation for the relaxation and cross-relaxation rates, which makes 
the information comprehensible (Figure 8.4). 

 

During the actual calculations care must be taken not to exceed the applicability 
, where 
range of the Redfield theory, which may be roughly outlined as 
Ri  are  the  computed  relaxation  rates.  This  criterion  has  been  shown  to  have  an  ample 
safety  margin  and  it  is  generally  believed  that  Redfield  theory  remains  quantitatively 
, but no further than that [7, 9].

Chapter 8. Relaxation processes in the high-field 19F photo-CIDNP.  

Thus, quite encouragingly, it appears that, after all the relaxation pathways have 
been taken into account, the correlation time dependence of the high-field geminate 19F  
photo-CIDNP  effect  gets  explained,  completely  ab  initio  and  without  any  adjustable 
parameters.  The  important  question  now  is  which  particular  relaxation  pathway  is 
responsible for this phenomenon. A systematic search has been performed, when every 
element of the relaxation matrix was zeroed in turn and computation was repeated and 
the  result  inspected  for  significant  differences  to  that  in  Figure  8.5.  This  search  has 
come  up  with  two  relaxation  pathways  connecting  eight  pairs  of  spin  orders  that  are 
wholly  responsible  for  the  observed  correlation  time  dependence  of  geminate  19F 
CIDNP at 14.1 Tesla:

These  transitions  are  shown  with  a  thick  diagonal  dashed  line  on  the  top  right 
diagram  in  Figure  8.4.  Physically  they  represent  a  relaxation  transition  from  pure 
electron singlet or triplet state to the singlet or triplet that is conditional upon the nuclear 
spin  state  –  remarkably  similar  to  the  usual  CIDNP  generation  scheme,  but  stemming 
from relaxation. These are essentially transverse processes, which is why they were not 
picked up by the theories proposed by Adrian and Tsentalovich et al. When the radicals 
recombine,  the  electron  component  disappears,  leaving  the  correlation  time  dependent 
nuclear magnetization behind.

validity interval of the Redfield theory.

The  correlation  time  dependence  of    the processes  (7.11)  is  given  in  Table  8.2 
and shown graphically for the 3-fluorotyrosyl radical in Figure 8.6 (c.f. Figures 8.2 and 
8.3).  As  the  correlation  time  increases,  this  cross-relaxation  rate  quickly  becomes  fast 
enough  to  be  operational  on  the  nanosecond  timescale  of  geminate  magnetization 
generation.

relaxation  transitions  (7.11)  in  the  3-fluorotyrosine  radical  at  three  different

The  region  to the  left  of  log(τc)  =  −8.5  is outside  the validity  interval  of  the 
Redfield theory.

the correlation time dependence displayed in Figure 8.6 remains completely unchanged 
all the way down to the fields of the order of 0.1 Tesla (Figure 8.7). At the fields lower

Beyond  its  conceptual  value  (which  clearly  merits  further  investigation,  both 
theoretical  and  experimental),  the  correlation  time  dependence  of  the  geminate  19F 
photo-CIDNP  effect  may  have  practical  uses,  as  it  provides  a  direct  measure  of  the 
correlation  time  in  short-lived  radical  species.  Another  interesting  question,  in  the 
context of some unexplained CIDEP patterns recently discussed by Borbat et al. [204, 
208], is whether the complete relaxation matrix treatment predicts those CIDEP patterns

as  well  and  which  relaxation  pathways  are  responsible.  More  generally,  because  it  is 
now possible to do brute force analytical relaxation theory on non-trivial spin systems, 
it  seems  worthwhile  to  launch  a  deeper  general  investigation  into  (hitherto  rather 
sparsely  researched)  area  of  relaxation-driven  radical  spin  dynamics.  Because  further 
19F  photo-CIDNP  studies  of  large  proteins  are  being  planned  (for  author’s  postdoc 
period with Professor Peter Hore), all of these questions will likely be investigated and 
answered. Stay tuned.

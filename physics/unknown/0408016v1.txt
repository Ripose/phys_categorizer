The  theoretical  formalism  of  local  density  approximation  (LDA)  to  density  functional 

theory (DFT) has been used to study the electronic and geometric structures of SimCn (1< 

m,  n  <  4;  n  <  m)  clusters.  An  all  electron  6-311++G**  basis  set  has  been  used  and 

complete  geometry  optimizations  of  different  possible  structures  for  a  particular  cluster 

have been carried out. Clusters with equal numbers of silicon and carbon atoms are found 

to  be  particularly  stable.  Based  on  the  simultaneous  criteria  of  highest  binding  energy, 

high band gap, high ionization potential, and low electron affinity, we believe that Si3C3 

is  a  candidate  for  a  particularly  stable  or  a  so-called  “magic  cluster”.  A  complete 

comparison of the structures and the stabilities  of  the  clusters,  and their dependence on 

cluster size and stochiometry have been performed in detail. Binding energies, vibrational 

frequencies,  HOMO-LUMO  gaps,  vertical  ionization  potentials  and  vertical  electron 

affinities  of  the  optimized  clusters  have  been  compared  with  other  experimental  and 

theoretical results available in the literature.

1. Introduction 

Clusters  are  distinctly  different  from  their  bulk  state  and  exhibit  many  specific 

properties, which distinguishes their studies as a completely different branch of science 

named  “Cluster  Science”.  Large  surface  to  volume  ratio  and  quantum  effects  resulting 

from  small  dimensions  are  usually  prominent  in  clusters  and  ideas  like  ‘super-atoms’, 

‘magic numbers’ or ‘fission’ in clusters have prompted a wide class of scientists to study 

this  ‘relatively’  new  area  of  the  physical  sciences.  Advances  in  information  technology 

have enabled scientists to study increasingly complex systems in this area [1-9].  Growing 

interests  in  the  stabilities  of  small  clusters  and  the  evolution  of  bulk  properties  from 

cluster  properties  are  also  due  to  the  emergence  of  new  areas  of  research  called 

nanoscience  and  nanotechnology  and  the  resulting  potentials  in  industrial  applications, 

e.g.  for electronic devices, for data storage, or for fostering chemical reactions [10-13]. 

Among various types of clusters, simple metal and semiconductor clusters remain to be 

the most important and widely studied clusters, both experimentally and theoretically. In 

the  area  of  semiconductor  clusters,  carbon  and  silicon,  though  belonging  to  the  same 

column  of  the  periodic  table,  vary  significantly  in  their  basic  chemical  and  physical 

properties. A combination of these two materials silicon-carbide (SiC) or carborundum in 

crystalline phase is a very interesting technological material. The wide energy band gap, 

high thermal conductivity, large break down field, and high saturation velocity of silicon 

carbide makes this an ideal material for high temperature, high power, and high voltage 

integrated  electronics.  However  clusters  exhibit  bonding  and  behavior,  which  is  far 

different from that in bulk or molecules.   

 

3

Our  interest  in  silicon-carbon  clusters  stems  from  three  points  of  view.  First,  in 

our  recent  studies,  we  have  observed  that  carbon  clusters  trapped  inside  medium  sized 

silicon cages give rise to highly symmetric, stable cage clusters. [14-15] This work is a 

part of our continuing investigation in the electronic and geometric structure properties of 

silicon-carbon clusters to understand the basic principles behind the high stability of such 

clusters.  Second, Si-C clusters have potential usage in the area of nano-technology and 

nanoscience  for  the  development  of  new  materials  for  the  nano-electronics  industry. 

Third,  it  is  important  to  understand  the  differences  in  silicon  and  carbon  bonding  and 

energetics. Silicon is known to prefer multidimensional single bonds and carbon can form 

single,  double  and  triple  bonds.  Our  research  here  is  focused  to  explore  the  nature  of 

these  hetero-atomic  clusters  and  to  determine  how  the  structure,  bonding  and  relative 

stability  of  the  clusters  are  affected  by  the  cluster  size  and  the  stochiometry.    As  the 

discussions  below  will  show,  there  have  been  several  works  in  the  literature  on  small 

SimCn clusters. Ours is the first attempt to study these clusters from a completely ab initio 

point of view with a large basis set with added diffuse functions. We also present detailed 

results  on  cohesive  energies  and  report  for  the  first  time  results  on  vertical  ionization 

potentials  and  vertical  electron  affinities  for  SimCn  small  clusters.  Of  course,  wherever 

possible,  we  compare  our  results  with  results  available  in  the  literature.  We  further 

investigate  whether  there  are  certain  “magic”  compositions  or  “magic  numbers”  for 

which  a  particular  cluster  is  very  stable.  First  principles  simulations,  based  on  density 

functional  theory  (DFT)  and  particularly  the  local  density  approximation  (LDA),  have 

proved  to  be  a  reliable  and  computationally  tractable  tool  in  quantum  chemistry  and 

 

4

condensed  matter  physics  [16-18].  This  formalism  is  used  here  to  investigate  mixed 

silicon-carbon clusters SimCn (1< m,n < 4 and n < m).   

2. Computational details 

One  of  the  primary  considerations  involved  in  these  calculations  is  the 

determination  of  the  methodology,  specifically  the  form  of  the  exchange-correlation 

potential and the type of basis set to be used. Since experimental results are available for 

the Si and C atoms [19], we tested our theoretical results (table 1) using various forms of 

exchange-correlation  functionals,  such  as  PW91  [20],  B3LYP  [21],  and  SVWN  [22], 

using  an  all-electron  6-311++G**  basis  set  [23]  in  the  Gaussian  ’03  suite  of  programs 

[24].  Best  results  were  obtained  with  SVWN  (Table  1).  Bertolus  et  al.  [25]  have  also 

concluded, after detailed testing of various functionals with a 6-31G* basis set, that the 

LSDA functional SVWN is one of the most precise functional for SimCn (3 < m+n < 6) 

systems.  Thus,  we  have  opted  to  use  this  functional  for  all  SimCn  clusters  with  an  all 

electron  6-311++G**  basis  set  in  the  local  density  approximation  (LDA)  to  density 

functional  theory  (DFT).  The  binding  energy  per  atom  for  the  neutral  clusters  is 

calculated from 

E b=  {[m E (Si) + n E (C)] –  [E (Sim Cn)]} / (m+n)                                                       (1)                                 

where  E  (Sim  Cn)  is  the  optimized  total  energy  of  the  cluster.  The  vertical  ionization 

potential is calculated from 

VIP = Em+n + - Em+n                                                                                                         (2) 

where  Em+n

+    is  the  total  energy  of  the  corresponding  cationic  cluster  at  the  neutral 

geometry. The vertical electron affinity is calculated from  

VEA = Em+n  - Em+n 

-                                                                                                       (3) 

 

5

where  Em+n

-  is  the  total  energy  of  the  corresponding  anionic  cluster  at  the  neutral 

geometry.  The  HOMO-LUMO  gap  is  computed  as  the  energy  difference  between  the 

highest  occupied  molecular  orbital  and  the  lowest  unoccupied  molecular  orbital.  All 

computations have been performed using the Gaussian ‘03 suite of programs [24] in the 

Supercomputing Center at the University of Texas at Arlington.  

3. Results   

In figures 1-10, we present the structures of lowest energy isomers of the SimCn clusters 

with  (1<  m,  n  <  4;  n  <  m),  with  the  bond  lengths  in  Angstroms.  The  structures  are 

denoted by (m, n, i), where i runs from 1 to the number of isomers of a particular cluster 

in  decreasing  order  of  stability.  All  structures  are  Berny  geometry  and  spin-optimized 

[26]. Tables 2-11 give the electronic state, and binding energy per atom, HOMO-LUMO 

gap, vertical ionization potential, vertical electron affinity (all in eV) for each structure. 

The  coordination  number  for  the  most  stable  cluster  in  each  set  is  shown  in  Table  12.  

Table 13 gives theoretical and experimental (where available) vibrational frequencies in 

cm–1  where  available.  We  also  compare  our  frequencies  with  the  results  obtained  by 

Bertolus et al. [25]. Table 14 shows the Mulliken charge distribution analysis [27]. In the 

following sections, we discuss the results in detail. 

3.1 SiC dimer  

One of the earlier theoretical calculations was by Bauschlicher and Langhoff [28]. They 

performed  configuration  interaction  calculations  using  a  large  ANO  [5s4p3d2f1g]  basis 

set and the best estimates for the spectroscopic parameters for the ground 3Π state of SiC 

are re = 1.719 A, ωe = 962 cm –1, and De = 4.4 eV. This was followed by an experimental 

detection  of  the  SiC  molecule  by  Bernath  et  al.  [29],  using  high-resolution  Fourier-

 

6

transform  emission  spectroscopy  techniques.  The  electronic  state  was  found  to  be  3Π, 

with an equilibrium bond length of 1.719 Å. There have also been other several ab initio 

studies. Martin et al. [30] calculated three lowest lying states of SiC, using Hartree-Fock 

based many-body perturbation theory methods, augmented coupled cluster methods, and 

configuration interaction methods with different basis sets. The ground state was found to 

be  3Π,  but  the  spectroscopic  constants  were  found  to  be  quite  sensitive  to  the  electron 

correlation method employed. Hunsicker and Jones [31], using a combination of density 

functional  and  molecular  dynamics  methods  and  periodic  boundary  conditions,  also 

found  3Π to be the ground state with a bond length of 1.719 Å. In our calculations, we 

found  the  SiC  dimer  (figure  1)  to  have  a  bond  length  of  1.717  Å  with  the  3Π  as  the 

electronic state. Vibrational analysis (table 13) shows a frequency of 986.12 cm-1, close 

to the experimental value 962 cm-1.  Our  dissociation  energy for  the  SiC  dimer  is  5.504 

eV and we note that local density approximation or in general, density functional theory 

tends to overestimate the cohesive energy. 

3.2 Si2C isomers  

Dierckson et al. [32], using Si (6s, 5p) and C (6s. 4p) basis sets augmented with a 

set  of  d-polarization  functions,  and  Robles  and  Mayorga  [33],  using  6-31G*//3-21G* 

basis  sets,  found  Si2C  to  be  linear  at  the  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  level  of  theory.  However, 

Dierckson et al. many body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations [23], including all 

single,  double,  triple,  and  quadruple  substitutions  (MP4)  found  a  bent  structure  to  be 

minimum at a Si-C-Si angle of 118ο, suggesting the importance of electron correlations in 

such  systems.  The  SiC  bond  distance  was  1.715  Ǻ  and  the  ionization  potential  and 

electron affinity were 9.29 eV and –0.37 eV, respectively. On the other hand, Grev and 

 

7

Schaefer [34], and Largo-Cabrerizo and Flores [35] have shown that HF theory also gives 

the bent structure to be the minimum by using a double zeta and two sets of polarization 

functions  on  each  atom.  Rittby  [36]  investigated  this  system  using  various  basis  sets  at 

HF  level  as  well  as  second  order  many-body  perturbation  theory  (MBPT2)  level  and 

found  the  ground  state  to  be  indeed  a  closed  shell  C2v  symmetry  structure.  The  bond 

distance at the MBPT2 level with a 6-311G (2d) basis set was found to be 1.703 Ǻ, with a 

bond angle of 119.5ο.  Infrared Matrix Isolation Spectrum of the Si2C molecule by Kafafi 

et al. [37] concluded that the molecule has C2v symmetry with a lower limit of 110ο for 

the  Si-C-Si  bond  angle.  We  have  identified  three  optimized  structures  for  Si2C  trimer. 

The lowest energy isomer is a bent singlet 1A1 state (figure 2.1.1) with an apex angle of 

136.52ο. The general structure agrees also with the results of Bertolus et al. [25]. Our Si-

C bond lengths are 1.694 Å, slightly lower than the bond length in the SiC dimer. But, the 

Si-Si bond length is 3.147 Å, a rather high value. The corresponding distances obtained 

by Bertolus et al. [25], using a smaller basis set, are 1.699 Å and 3.021 Å.  Next, a linear 

structure (figure 2.1.2) with the carbon atom in the middle has a binding energy per atom 

only  0.002eV  lower  than  the  corresponding  energy  of  the  bent  ground  state.  The  Si-C 

bond length is comparable with the global minima structure. At the LDA level of theory, 

these two structures are basically degenerate. Another carbon terminated linear structure 

has a binding energy per atom of 1.367 eV lower than the corresponding energy of the 

global minimum.  Our theoretical frequencies do not agree well with experimental values 

and further experimental results will be welcome. 

3. 3 Si2C2 isomers  

 

8

Trucks and Bartlett [38] studied the low-lying electronic states of the Si2C2 system 

using full fourth-order many body perturbation theory (MBPT4). They found the lowest 

lying  structure  to  be  a  rhombus,  12  kcal/mol  lower  than  the  linear  structure.  This  was 

followed  by  another  MBPT  study  by  Fitzgerald  and  Bartlett  [39].  In  this  study,  the 

rhombus was again found to be the ground state structure but a distorted trapezoid was 

found  to  be  the  second  most  stable  structure,  the  difference  in  energies  being  only  4.0 

kcal/mol.  Second  order  many  body  perturbation  theory  (MP2)  studies  by  Lamertsma  et 

al.  [40]  and  MD  calculations  by  Hunsicker  and  Jones  [31]  also  found  the  ordering  for 

stability  from  the  rhombic  structure  followed  by  the  trapezoid  and  then  the  linear 

structure.  The  same  conclusions  were  reached  by  Presilla-Marquez  et  al.  [41]  by  MP2 

calculations with a 6-311G** basis set. Using multi-configurational-self-consistent-field 

(MCSCF) wave functions, Robles and Mayorga [33] and Rintelman and Gordon [42] also 

found  the  global  minimum  structure  of  Si2C2  to  be  a  rhombus.  In  our  calculations,  we 

optimized eleven different structures. The lowest energy isomer is a cyclic rhombus with 

a  1Ag  state  (figure  2.2.1).  The  C-C  bond  length  of  1.422  Å  is  intermediate  between  a 

single  bond  (1.54  Å)  and  a  double  bond  (1.35  Å).  The  Si-C  bond  length  of  1.834  Å  is 

similar to a single bond length found in methysilane [43] and comparable to the lengths 

found in SiC2 [44]. Thus, our results suggest single bonds between silicon and carbon and 

a  probable  weak  bond  between  carbons.  The  optimization  process  also  resulted  in  four 

linear chain structures, the linear chain with two carbon atoms in the middle (figure 2.2.2) 

being  the  most  stable  among  all  chains  and  about  0.067  eV/atom  binding  energy  lower 

than  the  corresponding  energy  of  the  ground  state.  The  3Σg  state  also  has  a  strong  C-C 

bonding,  with  the  C-C  bond  of  length  1.276  Å  being  between  the  typical  double  bond 

 

9

(1.35 Å in ethylene) and triple bond (1.21 Å in acetylene) .The Si-C bond of 1.737 Å is 

close to the double bond value obtained by Schaefer [45]. In general, we find that silicon-

terminated chains are more stable than the carbon terminated clusters. A planar distorted 

trapezoidal  structure  (figure  2.2.3)  is  third  most  stable  structure,  with  a  0.083eV/atom 

lower binding energy than the corresponding energy of the rhombic global minima. The 

C-C bond length is 1.316 Å. Another trapezoidal structure (figure 2.2.5) with Si-C bond 

of  2.263  Å  and  C-C  bond  of  1.272  Å  was  also  found  to  be  one  of  the  ten  isomers. 

Another rhombic structure (figure 2.2.8) with Si-Si linkage of 2.335 Å, indicating single 

bonding  was  also  observed.  We  note  that,  in  general,  the  Si2C2  cluster,  with  equal 

numbers  of  silicon  and  carbon  atoms,  favors  planar  geometry.  The  experimental 

vibrational  spectra  by  Presilla-Marquez  et  al.  [41]  suggested  frequencies  of  982.9  cm-

1and 382.2 cm-1 for the fundamental modes of rhombic Si2C2. Our calculated frequencies 

(table  13)  compare  well  with  the  frequencies  obtained  by  Bertolus  et  al.  [25]  and  the 

experimental frequencies for the ground state structure.  

3.4 Si3C isomers  

Rittby  [46]  investigated  six  different  isomeric  structures  of  Si3C  using  Hartree-

Fock (HF) and second-order many body perturbation theories. The ground state structure 

was a rhomboidal C2v structure with two equivalent silicon atoms and a trans-annular Si-

C  bond.  The  same  structure  was  also  the  ground  state  structure  obtained  by  Hunsicker 

and  Jones  in  their  density  functional  calculations  with  simulated  annealing  [31],  by 

Bertolus  et  al.  [25],  and  by  Robles  and  Mayorga  [33].  We  have  spin-optimized  seven 

different  structures  and  conclude  that  the  most  stable  isomer  (figure  3.1.1)  is  the  fan-

shaped rhomboidal structure in 1A1 state with a Si2C sub molecule (3.1.1) as the ground 

 

10

state structure. The Si-C linkage is 1.760 Å and Si-Si bond is 2.416 Å. Comparison with 

the  other  four-member  silicon  –  carbon  clusters,  C4,  SiC3,  Si2C2  and  Si4  shows  that  all 

these structures expect C4 have rhombic or rhomboidal ground states. Another T-shaped 

structure  with  Si2C  sub  molecule  and  carbon  on  top  (figure  3.1.2)  is  found  to  have  a 

binding  energy  per  atom  0.265  eV  less  than  the  corresponding  energy  of  the  global 

minima. Two structures; a rhomboidal C2v structure (figure 3.1.3) with a Si3 silicon sub-

molecule  and  a  tetrahedron  with  a  carbon  atom  on  top  (figure  3.1.4)  are  energetically 

very close to each other and differ by only 0.011 eV in binding energy per atom. A linear 

chain with one carbon in middle (figure 3.1.5) is the next local minimum with a binding 

energy  per  atom  0.592  eV  less  than  the  corresponding  energy  of  the  global  minimum 

followed  by  a  T-shape  structure  (figure  3.1.6)  with  a  Si3  sub-molecule.  A  carbon-

terminated chain cluster (figure 3.1.7) is the least stable structure among all the clusters 

considered.  In  general,  we  conclude  that  a  cluster  with  more  Si-C  linkage  or  a  cluster 

with  Si2C  sub-molecule  is  more  energetically  preferred  than  the  one  with  Si3  sub-

molecule.  Also,  silicon-terminated  chains  are  energetically  preferred  over  carbon 

terminated clusters. The bonding preference thus appears to be in the order Si-C and Si-

Si.  Frequency  analysis  (table  13)  indicates  that  our  vibrational  frequencies  are  in  good 

agreement with experimental data as well as theoretical results. 

3.5 Si3C2   isomers  

 Froudakis  et  al.  [47]  studied  five  different  isomers  at  the  MP2  level  of  theory. 

This study and the MD-DF calculations of Hunsicker and Jones [31] indicate the lowest 

lying structure to be a planar pentagon. Bertolus et al. [25] and Robles and Mayorga [33] 

also  concluded  a  planar  pentagon  to  be  the  most  stable  structure.  We  spin-optimized  a 

 

11

total of ten isomers in different possible multiplicities. Initial geometries were chosen on 

the  basis  of  Si5  and  C5  structures.  We  conclude  that  a  planar  pentagon  with  a  C2  sub 

molecule (figure 3.2.1) is the ground state structure showing strong multi-center bonding. 

The strong Si-C bonds of lengths 1.727 and 1.909 Å, along with a stronger C-C bond of 

length 1.362 Å contribute towards the stability of this cluster. Our vibrational frequencies 

(table  13)  agree  well  with  the  experimental  and  theoretical  frequencies  reported  in  the 

literature.  The  next  stable  structure  (figure  3.2.2)  is  a  silicon-terminated  alternate  chain 

structure with a binding energy per atom 0.364 eV lower than the corresponding energy 

of  the  global  minimum  structure.  The  two  next  stable  structures  are  three-dimensional 

structures; a prism (figure 3.2.3) with C-Si-C angle of 126.99 degrees and a bi-pyramid 

(figure  3.2.4.)  with  C-Si-C  angle  of  88.83  degrees.  These  structures  are  energetically 

close to each other and differ in binding energy per atom by 0.092 eV. The prism is more 

stable  because  of  the  open  geometry  of  the  structure.  Basically  in  the  prism,  carbons 

cannot  form  a  bond,  but  overall,  this  structure  is  held  together  due  to  the  presence  of 

several  Si-C  bonds.  A  planar  dumbbell  structure  (figure  3.2.6)  and  a  three-dimensional 

structure (figure 3.2.7) have the same energy and have binding energies per atom 0.621 

eV lower than the corresponding energy of the global minimum. The planar structure has 

a SiC2 sub-molecule with a C-C bond of 1.262 Å but the 3D structure with C1 symmetry 

also exhibits a C-C bond of 1.354 Å with a shorter Si-C bond of 1.806 Å as compared to 

other  structures  and  thus  is  not  as  stable  as  some  of  the  other  structures.  Other  less 

favored structures are also shown in Figure 5. We note again that the stability of a cluster 

depends  on  the  formation  of  strong  C-C  and  Si-C  bonds,  which  are  more  energetically 

 

12

favorable than the Si-Si bonds. For this cluster, planar structures are preferred over three-

dimensional structures.  

3.6 Si3C3 isomers  

Muhlhauser  et  al.  [48]  investigated  up  to  seventeen  different  isomers  of  this 

clusters  by  re-optimizing  most  stable  HF  geometries  at  MP2  (TZP)  and  MP2  (TZ2P) 

levels. Hunsicker and Jones [31] performed MD-DF calculations on neutral and anionic 

eight stable geometries. Both studies indicate that the ground structure is a pyramid-like 

structure  with  Cs  symmetry.  We  studied  six  isomers  and  conclude,  in  agreement  with 

others, that the distorted pentagonal pyramid with a C3 sub-molecule (figure 3.3.1) is the 

most stable structure. There is a formation of a C-C double bond of 1.325 Å. The distance 

between the two base silicon atoms is 3.67 Å, too large for any silicon single bonds. But 

the two capping atoms have Si-Si bond distance of 2.538 Å well within the range of Si-Si 

single bond length.  The Si-C bonds are 1.858 Å, lie within the range for Si-C single bond 

length.  The  stability  of  this  structure  is  due  to  high  Si-coordination.  The  vibrational 

frequencies are given in table 13. There are only two experimental frequencies available 

and one of our frequencies is close to the lower frequency. Three other three-dimensional 

structures,  close  in  binding  energy  per  atom  to  the  ground  state  structure,  were  also 

found.  One  of  these  structures  (figure  3.3.5)  showed  formation  of  two  C-C  bonds  of 

lengths  1.307  Å  and  1.358  Å  and  is  the  least  stable  among  all  the  3D  structures.  Thus, 

Si3C3 with equal numbers of silicon and carbon atoms, prefer overall three-dimensional 

geometries  compared  to  the  planar  or  linear  structures.  Stability  in  this  cluster  is 

attributed  to  the  formation  of  multiple  bonds.  Our  theoretical  frequencies  are  shown  in 

 

13

table  13  and,  as  far  as  we  know,  no  experimental  frequencies  are  available  in  the 

literature. Experimental results would be very welcome. 

3.7 Si4C isomers  

The studies so far on this system have been performed, for example, by Bertolus 

et al. [25] and by Hunsicker and Jones [31] who identified two structures for this cluster. 

We investigated seven isomers. The initial geometry was based on a Si4 cluster, and the 

most stable structure is found to be a distorted trigonal bipyramid with a carbon atom at 

the apex (figure 4.1.1). This is similar to the structure obtained by Robles and Mayorga 

[33].  The  Si-Si  linkage  is  2.457  Å  and  the Si-C bond length is 1.879 Å. Also, a planar 

structure (figure 4.1.2) lies very close, with a binding energy per atom just 0.14eV lower 

than the corresponding energy of the ground state structure. It is interesting to note that 

this structure consisting of a Si2C sub-molecule is more stable than another planar (figure 

4.1.5) structure with a Si3 sub-molecule. The formation of two Si-C bonds of length 1.848 

Å (figure 4.1.2) contributes to the stability of this structure. The next stable structure is 

cross-shaped  (figure  4.1.3)  with  four  Si-C bonds of 1.821 Å each. A carbon-terminated 

chain  is  the  least  stable  structure  of  all  the  clusters  considered  in  this  category.  As 

expected,  these  silicon  rich  clusters  prefer  three-dimensional  bonding  as  compared  to 

linear or planar structures and a major reason contributing to the stability is the formation 

of Si-C bonds. 

3. 8 Si4C2   isomers  

Results  on  four  different  structures  by  Froudakis  et  al.  [47]  and  by  Hunsicker 

Jones  [31]  indicate  only  one  C2v  isomer  to  be  a  stable  minimum.  We  studied  fourteen 

structures  including  both  two-dimensional  as  well  as  three-dimensional  geometries, 

 

14

expecting  the  structures  to  be  similar  to  Si6  and  C6  and  some  strong  C-C  bonding.  We 

conclude  that  a  3D  distorted  pyramid  like  structure  (figure  4.2.1)  is  the  ground  state 

structure,  disagreeing  with  the  above  two  published  results  in  the  literature.  The  Si-C 

bond length is 1.841 Å and the Si-Si bond lengths are 2.411 Å and 2.086 Å, respectively. 

The two extreme silicon atoms are separated by 3.25 Å, too long for any bond and the C-

C bond length is 1.530 Å. The next stable structure, with a binding energy per atom 0.114 

eV  lower  than  the  ground  state  binding  energy,  is  the  three-dimensional  structure  with 

C2v symmetry quoted by Froudakis [47] as the minimum. The C-C bond length is 1.307 Å 

and  Si-Si  bond  length  is  2.125  Å,  with  the  Si-C  bond  length  being  1.831  Å.    The  C-C 

bond of 1.307 Å, between typical double (1.35 Å in ethane) and triple (1.21 Å in ethane) 

bonds  is  a  major  contributing  factor  towards  to  the  stability  of  this  isomer.  Si-Si  bond 

distance  is  2.124  Å.  This  structure  is  followed  by  another  three-dimensional  structure 

(figure 4.2.3) with D4h symmetry, with a binding energy per atom 0.171 eV lower than 

the corresponding energy of the ground state. It shows four Si-Si bonds of 2.423 Å. The 

C-C  separation  of  1.786  Å  and  is  too  large  for  any  bonding.  This  structure  can  also  be 

said to have been derived from the Si4 tetrahedron, but with C2 capping. The reason for 

the stability of this structure is the presence of eight strong Si-C bonds of length 1.932 Å.  

Several other low-lying structures were also considered as shown in Figure 8.  

3.9 Si4C3   isomers 

As far as we know, these clusters have not yet been studied in detail yet. There is 

a recent study by Bertolus et al. [49], a combination of MD and ab initio DFT methods, 

which identified triangular planar pyramid-like structure to be the ground state structure.  

We  identified  nine  isomers  for  this  cluster.  The  lowest  lying  is  the  three  dimensional 

 

15

structure (figure 4.3.1). The Si-Si bond length is 2.539 Å and Si-C bond lengths are1.827 

Å  and  1.803  Å,  respectively.  Several  Si-C  bonds  and  strong  C-C  bond  of  1.27  Å 

contribute to the stability of this structure.  The next structure is also a three-dimensional 

structure with a C3 sub molecule at base with C-C bonds of lengths 1.314 Å. Three chain 

structures were also observed and silicon terminated chains are found to be more stable 

that  carbon  terminated  chains.    One  chain  structure  with  three  carbon  atoms  in  center 

(figure 4.3.4) and C-C bonds each of 1.278 Å in length is the most stable among the three 

linear chains. Other less stable planar structures are also shown in Figure 9. In general, 

Si4C3  structures  prefer  three-dimensional  geometries  compared  to  planar  or  linear 

structures.  

3.10 Si4C4   isomers   

These clusters have also not yet been studied in detail yet. The study by Bertolus 

et al. [49] identified a 3D pyramid-like structure, based on Si3C3, to be the ground state 

structure.    We  have  studied  twelve  isomers  and  find  that  the  ground  state  structure  is  a 

planar T-shaped structure (figure 4.4.1) with a Si3 sub-molecule.  The four carbon atoms 

in  a  row  with  a  C-C  bond  length  of  1.259  Å  each  along  with  silicon  termination 

contribute towards the high stability of this structure. Three three-dimensional structures 

were  also  observed  out  of  which  3D  trapezoid  (figure  4.4.2)  was  the  most  stable,  with 

four  C-C  bonds  of  1.466  Å  each.  These  bonds  contribute  towards  the  stability  of  this 

isomer. A cubic structure (figure 4.4.5) with no C-C bonds was found to be least stable 

among  the  three  dimensional  structures.  Several  other  planar  and  linear  structures  were 

observed as shown in Figure 10. 

4. Discussions and Conclusions 

 

16

In figure 11, we have plotted the binding energy per atom versus the number of 

atoms in the cluster. In the cases where the number of atoms are equal in two clusters, we 

have chosen the cluster with  the  higher binding energy per atom. There is an odd-even 

oscillation  in  the  binding  energy  plot,  well-known  in  the  theory  of  metal  clusters  [1-9] 

and  we  note  clusters  with  equal  number  of  silicon  and  carbon  atoms  are  particularly 

stable.  In  fact,  the  Si3C3  cluster,  a  three  dimensional  pyramid  with  the  highest  co-

ordination  number  of  3.33  (table  12),  has  the  highest  binding  energy  of  5.482  eV. 

Comparing  the  clusters  Si3C2  versus  Si4C  and  Si3C3  versus  Si4C2,  we  note  that  if  the 

carbon  atoms  are  replaced  by  silicon  atoms,  the  binding  energies  tend  to  decrease. 

Preference for a particular geometry depends on various factors such as the presence of 

strong C-C bonds, number of Si-C bonds formed and the co-ordination of the atoms.  

 The  highest  occupied  molecular  orbital  -  lowest  unoccupied  molecular  orbital 

(HOMO-LUMO) gap for the neutral clusters are also given in tables 2-11 and plotted in 

figure  12.  No  other  published  data  on  these  gaps  exists  in  the  literature  apart  from  the 

Hartree-Fock results by Robles and Mayorga on some of these clusters [33]. Their gaps 

range from about 7 to 10 eV. These gaps are larger than the gaps in our calculations and 

the differences are believed to be due to the different theoretical formalisms employed, 

namely Hartree-Fock theory versus density functional theory. Our results do not indicate 

any  definite  pattern  related  to  cluster size or stochiometry for  the gaps. Si3C3,  the  most 

stable  structure  with  a  C-C  bond  length  of  1.325  Å,  has  a  high  gap  of  3.619  eV.  The 

possible cause for such high gap for Si3C3 structure is the high multi-center partial ionic 

and covalent bonding exhibited by it. The next most stable cluster Si4C2 also has a rather 

high gap of 3.530 eV. The LDA-DFT approach is well known to underestimate the band 

 

17

gaps  of  a  material  and  these  clusters  can  indeed  qualify  as  the  wide  band  gap 

semiconductor clusters similar to their bulk counterparts.  

The vertical ionization potentials (VIP) and the vertical electron affinities (VEA) 

of  the  clusters  are  also  shown  in  tables  2-11.  No  published  data,  either  theoretical  or 

experimental,  exists  in  the  literature  for  these  quantities  except  for  the  SiC  dimer.  Our 

vertical ionization potential for the SiC dimer, 9.758 eV, is in the experimental range of 8 

to 10 eV.  The Si4C2 cluster possesses the highest ionization potential of 9.795 eV. The 

Si4C4  cluster  shows  highest  electron  affinity  of  3.541  eV.  As  noted  before,  the  most 

stable structure Si3C3 has a rather high ionization potential of 9.664 eV and a low electron 

affinity of 0.918 eV. Based on the simultaneous criteria of highest binding energy, high 

band gap, high ionization potential, and low electron affinity, we believe that Si3C3 is a 

candidate for a “magic cluster”, though the concept of magicity is not well defined for 

semiconductor clusters.      

Table  14  shows  the  Mulliken  charge  distributions  [27]  for  the  ground  state 

structures  of  the  SimCn  neutral  clusters.  The  geometry  and  stability  of  the  clusters  are 

closely  related  to  the  bonding  features  and  charge  distributions.  The  SiC  dimer  shows 

than  the  carbon  atom  gains  negative  charge  whereas  the  silicon  atom  loses  charge,  as 

expected from electronegativity considerations. This is true for all clusters except for the 

Si4Cn clusters. Here one of the silicon atoms gains slightly negative charge. For example, 

for  Si4C  structure,  one  silicon  atom  is  negatively  charged  while  the  other  three  silicon 

atoms have equal positive charges. For Si4C2 cluster, the silicon atom forming the SiC2 

sub-molecule  in  the  structure  gains  negative  charge.  For  the  Si4C3  cluster,  the  silicon 

atom  at  the  apex  of  the  structure  gains  almost  equal  amount  of  negative  charge  as  the 

 

18

adjacent carbon atom. In the case of Si4C4 cluster also, the silicon atom at the apex of the 

silicon  triangle  gains  almost  the  same  amount  of  negative  charge  as  the  neighboring 

carbon atom. Chain structures with alternating silicon and carbon atoms show alternating 

positive and negative charges.  

In summary, the formalism of LDA-DFT has been used to study neutral hetero-

atomic silicon carbon clusters. In particular, the Si3C3 cluster is a candidate for a highly 

stable or a “magic” cluster and clusters with equal number of silicon and carbon atoms 

tend to be particularly stable. We also conclude that stoichiometry and bonding play an 

important role in the stability of a cluster. The ratio of sp2 to sp3 hybridization, formation 

of C-C bonds and several Si-C bonds directly affects the stability of a cluster. Thus the 

cluster stability can also be attributed to the mixed covalent and ionic bonding.

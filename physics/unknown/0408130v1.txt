Abstract

Open single-mode metallic cavities operating in nonradiative configurations are proposed

and  demonstrated.  Starting  from  well-known  dielectric  resonators,  possible  nonradiative

cavities  have  been  established;  their  behavior  on  the  fundamental  TE011  mode  has  been

predicted  on  the  basis  of  general  considerations.  As  a  result,  very  efficient  confinement

properties are expected for a wide variety of open structures having rotational invariance.

Test  cavities  realized  having  in  mind  practical  millimeter  wave  constraints  have  been

characterized  at  microwave  frequencies.  The  obtained  results  confirm  the  expected  high

performances  on  widely  open  configurations.  A  possible  excitation  of  the  proposed

resonators  exploiting  their  nonradiative  character  is  discussed,  and  the  resulting  overall

ease of realization enlightened in view of millimeter wave employments.

1. Introduction

The  millimeter  wave  frequency  interval  still  represents  a  relatively  unexplored  field  of

investigation for electromagnetic spectroscopy. This was mainly due to the lack of proper

sources  having  acceptable  combinations  of  power,  stability  and  tunability.  A  significant

limitation  to  the  development  of  millimeter  wave  spectroscopy  seemed  also  due  to  the

inadequateness of the waveguide-based propagation, solved in favor of sophisticated quasi-

optical techniques. Recently, the solid-state technology developed first versatile millimeter

wave sources, although still relatively limited in the emitted power. As a consequence, the

microwave electric or magnetic field available on the sample is often too limited, requiring

a  resonant  structure  in  order  to  increase  the  density  of  the  electromagnetic  energy  in  the

active region of the spectrometer.

At millimeter wavelengths the most  common resonant  devices  are  given  by  overmoded

resonators, which are relatively easy to be realized.  In addition to the well-known Fabry-

Perot cavities [1-4], more recently overmoded dielectric resonators have been proposed as

well  [5  and  reference  therein].  The  quality  factor  Q  achievable  in  the  above  overmoded

devices  can  be  quite  high  (tens  of  thousand  or  higher  at  room  temperature),  leading  to

extremely  selective  frequency  behaviors.  On  the  other  hand,  in  many  spectroscopic

applications  the  absolute  sensitivity  is  related  to  the  intensity  of  the  electric  or  magnetic

field on the sample; these quantities are in turn proportional to the ratio between the merit

factor Q and the active volume of the resonator. In this respect overmoded structures don’t

show clear advantages with respect to properly realized single-mode resonators and often,

as in case of Fabry-Perot having reasonable dimensions, the achievable absolute sensitivity

is  clearly  unsatisfactory.  The  use  of  overmoded  resonators  can  be  moreover  hindered  by

geometrical  constraints  imposed  by  the  employed  setup.  The  above  reasons  basically

explain the efforts made towards the realization of millimeter wave single-mode resonators

[6, 7]. The main difficulty to be overcome in this case is  given by the typical size of the

employed  components  that,  being  of  the  order  or  smaller  of  the  resonant  wavelength,

becomes harder and harder to be handled. In case of the popular TE011 cylindrical cavity,

for instance, the axial cross section that ensures the highest Q factor is given by 3.95 mm

by 3.95 mm at 100 GHz [8]. A much more  critical  point  is  represented  by  the  excitation

mechanism.  The typically  adopted  solution,  the  coupling  hole,  is  directly  borrowed  from

the microwave technology. However, at 100 GHz a typical diameter of the coupling hole is

given by 0.8 mm, with  a corresponding  thickness  of  the  cavity  wall  around  this  aperture

2

less  than  0.05  mm;  as  a  consequence,  a  very  sophisticated  design  and  realization  of  the

cavity results [6]. Another key point of a single-mode cavity  is  given by  its capability to

allow a non-destructive access to the sample, that is an access that doesn’t reduce sensibly

the performances of the cavity itself. Such access can be necessary for the manipulation of

the sample or its additional irradiation.

An exemplary case where these aspects are of basic importance is given by the Electron

Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy [9]. Here, the full rotation of the sample with

respect to the magnetic field is generally required in single crystal studies. In addition, the

cavity should be to some extent open,  in  order  to allow an  efficient  static  magnetic  field

modulation  as  well  as  radiofrequency  excitation  (for  electron-nuclear  double  resonance

techniques  [9]),  or  optical  access  (in  case  of  optically-activated  samples  or  optically-

detected  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy  [10]).  In  the  limit  of  high-field  (millimeter

wave) EPR, these requirements impose strict constraints on the realization of the cavity. As

a result, the performances of the cavity  or  the  capabilities  of  the  employed spectroscopic

techniques are often sensibly reduced in comparison to the ideal ones. In case of a TE011

cylindrical  cavity  working  at  275  GHz,  the  radiofrequency  irradiation  of  the  sample  has

been recently obtained by cutting 3 slits of 0.1 mm width perpendicularly to the axis of the

cavity [11], following the solution adopted at 100 GHz [6]. The realization of single-mode

resonators  for  millimeter  wave  spectroscopy  seemed  then  mainly  oriented  to  a  simple

rescaling  of  the  design  developed  at  microwave  frequencies.  Apparently,  only  limited

efforts  were  dedicated  to  the  realization  of  innovative  solutions  suitable  for  millimeter

wave applications in any of their aspects. A recent attempt to realize single-mode dielectric

resonators specifically conceived for millimeter wavelengths is reported in Ref. [12]. Here

the  state  of  the  art  of  the  power-to-field  conversion  efficiency  at  room  temperature  has

been  established,  using  low-permittivity  resonators  in  the  so-called  NonRadiative  (NR)

configuration  [13].  The  peculiarity  of  these  devices  is  given  by  their  partially  open

structure, in which the metallic shielding is reduced to two planar and parallel mirrors; the

distance between the mirrors can be as high as 

, where 

λ  is the wavelength in vacuum

0

corresponding to the resonance frequency. The excitation of the NR Dielectric Resonators

(NRDRs) can be obtained exploiting their nonradiative character, which basically prevents

the  propagation  of  the  radiation  outside  the  dielectric  region  [12].  A  simple  excitation

configuration  is  then  compatible  with  the  structure  of  the  resonator,  without  need  of

sophisticated  ad  hoc  designs.  The  resulting  device,  based  essentially  on  a  dielectric  disc

λ
0
2

3

and  planar  mirrors,  is  at  the  same  time  effective  and  easy  to  be  realized,  a  mandatory

characteristic for generalized millimeter-wave employments.

The main aim of this work is the generalization of the above NR configuration, in order

to  include  purely  metallic  single-mode  cavities  in  a  simple  and  unified  approach.  The

starting  point  will  be  represented  by  a  possible  analogy  among  NR  dielectric

configurations and metallic  cavities.  Following  this  analogy,  the  TE011  mode  of  an  Open

NR  Cavity  (ONRC)  will  be  investigated  at  microwave  frequencies  for  a  wide  range  of

geometrical configurations. The obtained results will demonstrate the possibility of simple

and innovative millimeter wave ONRCs.

This paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  2  will  introduce  the  theoretical  background

related to NR devices. Some generalized NR dielectric  configurations will be introduced,

and the analogous metallic cavities proposed. The expected behavior of their TE011 mode

will be discussed on the basis of general considerations. Section 3 will be dedicated to the

experimental  characterization.  The  criterion  employed  for  the  design  of  the  test  cavity

resonating at microwave frequencies will be discussed. The results obtained on the TE011

mode will be presented and analyzed. The implications of these results will be the topic of

Section 4. Here the achieved merit factors will be interpreted in terms of the different loss

mechanisms, and their extension to higher frequencies discussed. Specific  applications of

these devices and their general perspectives will be discussed as well.

2. Generalities

The simplest configuration  of  a  NRDR  is  given  by  a  cylindrical  low-loss  dielectric  rod

having circular cross section, whose planar surfaces are in contact with conducting planes,

as sketched in Fig. 1a. Here l represents the distance between the conducting planes, and d

the diameter of the dielectric disc; the real part of the permittivity of the dielectric region
will be indicated as  ε′ .

the split NRDR.

A  proper  design  of  this  structure  ensures  resonance  modes  whose  merit  factor  is  not

affected by irradiation losses, that is nonradiative resonances. The NR regime is given by

the condition 

l

, where 

λ  refers to each specific resonance frequency [12, 14]. The

0

<

λ
0
2

working  principle  of  the  NRDRs  can  be  naively  explained  in  terms  of  allowed  (above

cutoff)  and  forbidden  (below  cutoff)  propagation  regimes.  Indeed,  when  the  conditions

<

l

< ⋅
l

ε′

  and  d

l∼   are  fulfilled  the  radiation  can  propagate  inside  the  dielectric

λ
0
2

region  (which  is  above  cutoff),  and  cannot  propagate  in  the  outer  region  (below  cutoff),

where the fields decay exponentially. The quantity  l ε′

⋅

 represents the optical thickness

of the dielectric region. In a slightly different formulation, the NRDR operates below the

cutoff frequency of the parallel-plates TE and TM modes, while the coupling to the cutoff-

less  TEM  modes  vanishes  ([12]  and  reference  therein).  The  fundamental  modes  of  low-

permittivity NRDRs have been investigated up to millimeter wavelengths [12, 13].

The NR configuration of Fig. 1a can be generalized as shown in Fig. 1c (‘split’ NRDR)

and  Fig.  2a  (‘tuned’  NRDR).  Both  these  variants  have  been  characterized  at  microwave

frequencies,  as  anticipated  in  Ref.  [13];  high  Q  values  were  obtained  on  the  TE011  and

5

TM011  modes,  as  well  as  on  hybrid  modes.  These  results  will  be  presented  in  detail

elsewhere. Similar structures have been investigated in an interesting paper by Kobayashi

and  coworkers  [15].  Another  possible  generalization  of  the  basic  NR  configuration  is

shown in Fig. 2c (‘composite’ NRDR).

The point of interest is here given by the determination of possible analogies among these

NRDRs  and  purely  metallic  configurations.  Following  the  above-discussed  working

principle, the necessary condition for a NR device is the realization of a region of allowed

propagation  surrounded  by  a  region  of  forbidden  propagation.  A  NR  dielectric

configuration can be formally transformed in a similar NR metallic structure by replacing

the dielectric regions with cavities having similar optical size. The metallic configurations

shown in Figs. 1b, 1d, 2b and 2d can be then considered to some extent analogous to the

NRDRs of Figs. 1a, 1c, 2a and 2c,  respectively; similar  electromagnetic  behaviors  are  in

turn expected. The working condition

 is now replaced by 

l

l

as  usual  the  height  l′   of  the  metallic  cavity  is  assumed  of  the  order  of  its  diameter  d′ .

Following this simplified model, open single-mode metallic resonators should be possible

also for slight local enlargements of the distance between two parallel conducting plates. In

analogy  to  the  behavior  observed  in  NRDRs,  for  distances  l  sensibly  lower  than 

  the

NR condition is well verified and the evanescent field outside the central region decreases

very rapidly. On the contrary, when l approaches 

 the confinement mechanism becomes

λ
0
2

weaker  and  weaker  and  the  resonance  mode  extends  well  beyond  the  central  region,

requiring large conducting plates to prevent irradiation losses.

For some modes of high practical importance the above analysis can be formulated on the

basis  of  more  general  and  rigorous  considerations.  It  is  indeed  well  known  that  in

rotationally  invariant  dielectric  structures  with  isotropic  or  uniaxial  complex  permittivity

the  modes  having  azimuthal  invariance  (vanishing  azimuthal  index)  are  either  transverse

electric TE or transverse magnetic TM. These modes can be accordingly indicated as TE0

and TM0. The demonstration of this property can be found  for instance in Cap. 5 of Ref.

[16] and in Refs. [17, 18]; further generalizations can be inferred from Refs. [19] and [20].

The TE0 modes of a NR structure don’t share in particular any field components with the

cutoff-less  TEM  modes,  so  that  their  irradiation  losses  in  principle  vanish  for  any

configuration  fulfilling  the  nonradiative  criterion.  Accordingly,  any  NR  structure  having

rotational  invariance  shows  at  least  a  family  of  modes  characterized  by  vanishing

irradiation losses. This is equally true for the particular case of purely metallic structures.

The  TE0  modes  of  the  open  configurations  reported  in  Figs.  1b,  1d,  2b  and  2d  are  then

expected  free  from  irradiation  losses  until  their  resonance  frequency  violates  the

nonradiative  criterion,  provided  that  the  extension  of  the  metallic  plates  is  large  enough.

The  remaining  part  of  the  paper  will  be  basically  dedicated  to  the  confirmation  of  this

conclusion.

The use of the TE011 mode of the symmetrically open configuration of Fig. 1b has been

proposed for the dielectric characterization of planar materials [21-23]. The mathematical

modeling of this device has been elegantly developed in the paper by Janezic and Baker-

Jarvis [24]. However, the analysis and the use of this configuration were limited to small

gaps, in which the electromagnetic fields extend only marginally in the volume outside the

central  cavity.  The  limit  height  of  the  gap,  its  allowed  positions  along  the  body  of  the

cavity, and the possible benefits of widely open structures were apparently not recognized.

The main practical aspect to be faced with for an effective use of the resonator concerns

its  excitation.  In  principle,  any  of  the  well-established  excitation  techniques  as  coupling

holes  [25],  loops  or  probes  [9],  dielectric  waveguides  in  NR  configurations  [26],  can  be

employed in combination with the proposed ONRCs. However at millimeter wavelengths,

7

where these devices should express their full benefits, the only practicable solution seems

given by coupling holes. As anticipated, the use of coupling holes requires a very critical

and sophisticated design of the resonator, to which often correspond limited adjustments of

the  coupling  parameter.  In  our  case  a  much  more  versatile  solution  exploits  the  NR

character of the proposed devices, in which the electromagnetic  fields outside  the  central

region decrease exponentially. These evanescent fields can be overlapped to  those  of  the

incoming  radiation  by  limiting  in  a  proper  way  the  extension  of  the  metallic  walls,  as

shown  in  Ref.  [12].  The  coupling  parameter  can  be  adjusted  by  changing  the  relative

position between the resonator and the incoming radiation. This solution, which has been

proven  quite  simple  and  effective  also  at  millimeter  wavelengths  [13],  can  be  directly

adopted  for  ONRCs  in  virtue  of  their  analogy  with  NRDRs.  In  case  of  ONRCs,  an

alternative  control  of  the  coupling  parameter  can  be  obtained  by  changing  the  distance  l

between  the  conducting  plates;  in  this  way  the  intensity  of  the  evanescent  field  can  be

effectively  controlled.  The  resulting  perturbation  of  the  resonance  frequency  can  be

compensated acting on the height of the central cavity.

3. Experimental evidences

The  cavity  employed  for  the  microwave  measurements  is  sketched  in  Fig.  3.  It  was

basically  composed  by  two  aluminum  plates,  each  of  them  equipped  with  a  mobile

aluminum plunger, separated by three pedestals.

The measurements were intended for the demonstration of the NR principle as well as for

a realistic evaluation of the achievable millimeter wave performances; accordingly, higher

mechanical tolerances than that easily obtainable were intentionally chosen. The upper part

of the cavity was given by a parallelepiped having a 30 mm by 30 mm cross section and a

13.85 mm diameter axial hole. The lower plate was realized in a similar way, with a cross

section  of  40  mm  by  40  mm,  slightly  larger  than  the  upper  one  for  mechanical

convenience;  the  diameter  of  its  hole  was  14.35  mm.  The  plungers  were  given  by  discs

with 13.7 mm diameter and 10 mm height.  The distance  between  the plates was fixed  to
4.25 ± 0.1 mm. The position of the plungers was changed independently from each other;

in  this  way  the  aperture  of  the  cavity  was  freely  positioned  along  its  axis.  None  of  the

metallic surfaces were polished. The resonances were detected in a reflection configuration

by  means  of  a  vector  network  analyzer.  The  excitation  was  guaranteed  by  a  probe

connected to the analyzer through a flexible cable; for the purpose of the present analysis

this indeed represents the most versatile solution at microwave frequencies.

Following  the  analysis  of the  previous section,  the maximum  working  frequency  of  the

employed cavity is given by 35.3 ± 0.8 GHz, as obtained from the limit condition 

l

=

λ
0
2

.

Close  to  this  limit  most  of  the  electromagnetic  energy  is  distributed  on  a  large  volume

outside  the  central  cavity.  The  related  energy  density  is  then  correspondingly  low;  in

addition, a relevant contribution to the losses is now expected from the finite conductivity

of  the  mirrors.  As  previously  discussed,  this  often  means  a  low  gain  in  the  absolute

sensitivity.  The  structure  of  the  test  cavity  chosen  for  these  measurements  allowed  the

monitoring  of  the  maximum  spread  of  the  resonance  mode.  The  NR  confinement  was

indeed guaranteed as far as the rim of the upper plate, namely for a maximum radius about

twice  to  that  of  the  central  cavity,  as  indicated  in  Fig.  3b.  Accordingly,  when  the  active

volume  of  the  resonance  became  about  three  times  that  of  the  central  cavity,  a  sensible

reduction of the measured merit factor was expected, as marker of the low energy density

limit.

The  measurements  were  organized  in  three  different  series,  in  which  one  plunger  was

fixed in a definite position and the other one moved in order to tune the cavity. In this way

the  same  resonance  condition  was  obtained  for  three  different  positions  of  the  aperture

along the axis of the resonator. The TE011 mode was unambiguously identified among the

different  observed  resonances  by  comparing  its  frequency  with  that  calculated  in  the

corresponding close cavity [27]. Indeed, this mode is expected only slightly perturbed by

9

the  aperture  when  the  NR  condition  is  well  verified  and  the  height  of  the  cavity  l′   is

sensibly higher than  l .

In the first series of measurements the upper plunger was fixed 7 mm above the aperture

(this  configuration  is  hereafter  referred  to  as  ‘7  mm  configuration’).  The  obtained

resonance frequency and unloaded merit factor Q0 are reported in Fig.  4 as  a function of

the  position  of  the  lower  plunger  with  respect  to  the  aperture;  positive  values  refer  to

positions inside the aperture, as shown in Fig. 2d. The maximum protrusion of the plunger

was limited by the presence of the probe.

In  all  series  of  measurements  a  similar  behavior  is  observed.  The  tuning  of  the  TE011

mode  increases  exponentially  as  the  height  of  the  cavity  is  reduced,  as  expected.  The

measured merit factor is generally quite high, excluding two dips that appear in any series.

The origin of these dips can be inferred from the obtained data. The first dip is related to an

anticrossing  phenomenon  with  a  second  mode,  as  evidenced  by  the  typical  frequencies

repulsion behavior. The spurious mode is not visible outside the interaction region and is

very  likely  characterized  by  a  low  merit  factor.  In  the  terminology  of  the  lumped  circuit

representation this phenomenon is typically referred to as reactive coupling of modes [28-

12

31]. The second dip doesn’t show a clear anticrossing behavior, so it can be either related

to a crossing of modes (resistive coupling of modes), or to a leakage phenomenon through

the  aperture.  In  the  latter  case  however  the  irradiation  losses  of  the  three  series  of

measurements should differ remarkably; indeed, the diverse position of the aperture along

the  cavity  in  correspondence  to  the  dip  should  give  sensibly  different  projections  of  the

resonance mode on the  leaking modes.  A  similar arguing  suggests  different positions  for
the minimum of the dip when plotted in terms of the total height  l′  of the cavity. On the

contrary,  the  close  coincidence  of  the  position  of  the  dip  shown  in  Fig.  7,  as  well  as  its

almost constant height resulting from Figs. 4b, 5b and 6b, appear as decisive evidence in

favor  of  a  modal  interaction  effect.  Also  in  this  case  the  spurious  mode  is  not  directly

visible and is expected to be characterized by a low merit factor.

The 3 mm configuration allowed the analysis of the whole frequency interval predicted

by the NR condition. The maximum observed resonance frequency was about 36 GHz, in

full  agreement  with  the  above  analysis.  Accordingly,  the  expected  nonradiative  behavior

seems fully confirmed in a wide range of conditions.

The  obtained  data  suggest  further  considerations.  Combining  the  results  of  all  the

investigated configurations, it follows that the NR confinement is effective for any of the

condition the aperture of the cavity represents about 50% of its total height. If the limit of

acceptable Q0 values is fixed to 3000, the corresponding interval of acceptable frequencies

extends for about 10% around 30 GHz. Better merit factors and wider tuning intervals are

expected for optimized cavity designs. For instance, the losses in the metallic walls can be

very likely reduced assuming for a given frequency a cross section close to the optimal one

factors calculated taking into account only metallic and irradiation losses, respectively. The

typical  Q0  obtained  when  the  aperture  of  the  cavity  is  small  in  comparison  to  its  total

height is of the order of 6000. By assuming that in these conditions the irradiation losses

are negligible and that the losses in the metallic walls don’t change appreciably by tuning

the cavity, 

0,radQ

 can be estimated for configurations having large apertures. In the above

frequency interval around 30 GHz the value of 

 estimated in this way is higher than

0,radQ

6000.  This  evaluation  is  expected  meaningful  also  at  millimeter  and  submillimeter

wavelengths, since  the  irradiation  losses  are  in  principle  independent  from  the  resonance

frequency  when  the  size  of  the  cavity  is  just  rescaled  [12];  in  addition,  the  relative

mechanical tolerances of the employed cavity are easily achievable at frequencies sensibly

higher than the microwave ones. The behavior of the irradiation losses confirms in general

that the electromagnetic fields were quite weak on the boundary of the resonator for most

of  the  investigated  geometries,  according  to  the  discussion  on  the  role  of  the  limited

extension  of  the  metallic  plates.  The  resonance  mode  is  generally  well  confined  close  to

the central cavity, ensuring a limited active volume and then a relevant energy density.

The above analysis demonstrates that ONRCs working on the TE011 mode can be easily

realized.  In particular, the aperture between the two parts of the resonator can  be  largely

varied in width and position without severe degradations of its performances, allowing the

realization of widely open single-mode  resonators. The same  conclusion  is  expected  true

for any TE0 mode.

In many applications the identification of the TE011 mode ensures a useful employment of

the  resonator,  also  when  the  field  distribution  of  the  nonvanishing  components  is  not

known  in  detail.  On  the  other  hand,  a  more  general  and  quantitative  approach  to  NR

resonators requires the modeling of field distribution and complex resonance frequency of

any mode. In this manner the NR regime of each resonance can be determined, allowing a

proper  discrimination  among  truly  resonant  and  spurious  modes.  The  design  of  the

resonator  can  be  then  optimized  in  order  to  maximize  the  operating  bandwidth.  The

accurate calculation of the electromagnetic parameters of a given resonance will allow in

particular  further  spectroscopic  applications,  as  the  complex  dielectrometry  of  laminar

materials.

The proposed analogy between NRDRs and ONRCs suggests a possible merging between

these  two  classes  of  resonant  structures,  in  which  dielectric  regions  are  combined  with

open cavities following the indications of the NR confinement mechanism. A rich variety

of  open  single-mode  resonators  can  be  realized  accordingly;  the  resulting  configurations

can share the typical benefits of their constituents, as the high  energy density  of NRDRs

and the ease of realization and tuning of ONRCs. The mechanical access to the cavity can

be  ensured  for  instance  by  a  low-loss  dielectric  plate,  inserted  in  the  cavity  through  its

planar  aperture.  The  dielectric  plate  can  extend  well  beyond  the  central  resonant  region,

15

provided that the NR condition is verified throughout. In this way a high degree of freedom

can be achieved in the manipulation of the sample.

In  conclusion,  the  expected  behavior  of  the  TE011  mode  of  ONRCs  is  fully  confirmed.

The excitation of these resonators can be easily obtained also at millimeter wavelengths by

exploiting their NR character. The overall structure of the proposed devices appears then

inherently  easy  to  be  realized  and  operated,  and  shows  clear  advantages  with  respect  to

standard  single-mode  cavities.  The  performances  suggested  by  the  present  analysis  are

quite promising, and typical of a wide variety of rotationally invariant metallic, dielectric

or  composite  configurations  obeying  only  to  the  NR  condition.  The  better  expression  of

these  benefits  is  expected  at  millimeter  and  submillimeter  wavelengths,  where  open  NR

single-mode  resonators  can  represent  a  decisive  innovation  in  many  applications.  The

potentialities  of  these  resonators  seem  still  largely  unexplored,  requiring  a  further

theoretical and experimental work in view of their full realization.

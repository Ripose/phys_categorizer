Abstract 
 
In this contribution, the correlation between fundamental interaction processes induced by 
radiation in silicon and observable effects which limit the use of silicon detectors in high 
energy physics experiments is investigated in the frame of a phenomenological model which 
includes: generation of primary defects at irradiation starting from elementary interactions in 
silicon; kinetics of defects, effects at the p-n junction detector level. The effects due to 
irradiating particles (pions, protons, neutrons), to their flux, to the anisotropy of the threshold 
energy in silicon, to the impurity concentrations and resistivity of the starting material are 
investigated as time, fluence and temperature dependences of detector characteristics. The 
expected degradation of the electrical parameters of detectors in the complex hadron 
background fields at LHC & SLHC are predicted.

1. Introduction 
 

Semiconductor crystals possess a high sensitivity to radiation. The action of radiation on crystals leads 
to the formation of lattice defects and to substantial changes in their properties. Intensive investigation of 
their behaviour under irradiation has been conducted over a period of several decades, but, up to now, not 
all physical aspects are clarified. 

The motivation of this study comes from the fact that silicon detectors will represent an option for the 
next  experiments  in  high  energy  physics  where  the  requirement  to  work  long  time  in  high  radiation 
environments will represent a major problem.  

In this contribution, the correlation between fundamental interaction processes induced by irradiation in 
silicon,  microscopic  aspects  of  the  degradation  (production  and  time  evolution  of  the  concentration  of 
defects)  and  observable  effects  at  the  level  of  the  p-n  junction  detector,  which  limit  the  use  of  silicon 
detectors: increase of the leakage current, of the effective carrier concentration in the space charge region 
(Neff), decrease of the charge collection efficiency due to the modification of the effective trapping time of 
charge carriers is investigated. A model for the degradation, developed successively by the authors, is used 
– see Ref. [1] and references cited therein. 

The main hypothesis made in the understanding of fundamental phenomena in silicon is brought by the 
consideration  of  the  existence  of  the  fourfold  coordinated  defect  [2],  as  a  primary  defect  in  addition  to 
“classical” vacancies and interstitials. This defect introduces a new type of symmetry of the lattice.

The  results  of  the  model  are  compared  with  available  experimental  data  permitting  to  estimate  the 
quality of predictions and their sensitivity to different parameters. The effects due to irradiating particles 
(pions, protons, neutrons), to the damage rate, to the anisotropy of the threshold energy in silicon, to the 
impurity  concentrations,  resistivity  and  growth  technology  (FZ,  DOFZ)  of  the  starting  material  are 
considered as time, fluence and temperature dependencies of detector characteristics. 

The  model  could  explain  in  a  natural  manner  the  modifications  of  electrical  parameters  of  devices 

especially after hadron irradiation. 
The time evolution of electrical characteristics of silicon detectors due to the hadron background expected 
at the LHC and SLHC is predicted. 
 
 
 
2. Modelling semiconductor degradation due to irradiation 
 

The primary mechanism of defect formation during irradiation in semiconductors is the collision of the 
incoming particle with the atoms of the crystal, which leads to the departure of the atom to a rather large 
distance from its original site, i.e., to the formation of separated Frenkel pairs. The process continues as a 
cascade, up to the threshold energy limit of the energy of recoils. In silicon, the components of the pair - the 
vacancy  V  and  the  self  interstitial  I  -  are  mobile  over  a  broad  temperature  range,  including  room 
temperature, and during diffusion they are either trapped by other primary defects and impurities with the 
formation of secondary defects, or migrate to sinks. The main characteristics of the kinetics of defects are 
summarised in Ref. [3].  

A special mention must be made for the SiFFCD defect. Predicted by Goedecker and co-workers [2], some 
characteristics were determined by the authors in Ref. [3]. This defect must be more stable than the vacancy 
for a large temperature interval [4]. The SiFFCD has not yet been detected experimentally, but this fact is not 
unexpected because  the  search  for  defects is  always  guided  by  theoretical  predictions.  Moreira  et.  al.  [5] 
found that the FFCD exists and is also stable in Ge, and their prediction is in agreement with experimental 
data [6]. In principle, this new type of defect could be characteristic for all semiconductors with diamond 
structure. 

The knowledge of the kinetics of defects in silicon during and after irradiation permits the determination 

of the effects produced at the p-n junction detector level: modification of the leakage current, effective 
carrier concentration in the space charge region (Neff) and the effective trapping probabilities of charge 
carriers. 
 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 

In Figures 1a ÷ c, the fluence dependence of the concentrations of defects, induced by 2·1014 cm-2 
neutron irradiation, both in FZ and DOFZ silicon, is presented as an example. The calculations reproduce 
the conditions at 10 days after irradiation, at room temperature. While the concentration of SiFFCD depends 
linearly on fluence, the concentration of vacancies in FZ Si has a tendency toward saturation. In DOFZ Si, 
the concentration of vacancies has a linear dependence on fluence, but is several orders of magnitude lower 
than in FZ Si, due to the fact that oxygen trap vacancies and form the VO centre. The presence of oxygen 
and the formation of VO and CiOi centres, which involve both vacancies and interstitials, conduce to much 
quicker stabilisation in time of oxygen rich silicon after irradiation. While for FZ materials the 
concentrations of V2 and CiCs have been estimated to be the most important, in DOFZ VO and CiOi are the 
defects with the highest concentrations.

The differences in silicon resistivity in the range 1 to 15 kWcm have irrelevant influence on the effective 
trapping times for electrons and holes, but they depend on the type and energy of irradiating particle. The 
model  reproduces  very  well  the  experimental  effective  electron  trapping  times  in  FZ  material  and 
differences  –  in  a  reasonable  range  exist  for  DOFZ  materials  and  for  hole  trapping  times.  Probably, 
additional  mechanisms  in  the  kinetics  of  defects  must  be  considered  in  the  model  to  diminish  these 
discrepancies.

The  correlation  between  fluence,  time,  temperature,  anisotropy  of  the  threshold  energy  for 
displacements, initial impurity concentrations in the starting materials and variation of device parameters 
(leakage current and Neff) has also been investigated.  

In Figure 3, the time dependence of the degradation constant of the leakage current at 20 and 0 OC is 
presented; experimental data from Ref. [8] are compared with model calculations: continuous (dashed) 
curves are associated with calculations with (without) consideration of the contribution of SiFFCD.

experimental  data  are  from  Ref  [9].  Crystal  orientation  has  been  introduced  into  the  model  by  the 
anisotropy of the threshold energy for displacements. In the figure the dotted curve calculated without the 
consideration of the SiFFCD defect illustrates its contribution to degradation.

All  these  results  put  in  evidence  the  essential  role  of  the  introduction  of  the  SiFFCD  defect  in  the 

modelling the degradation processes. 

Silicon  detectors  will  be  used  in  experiments  at  LHC  and  in  its  up-grade  in  the  tracking  of  charged 
particles. After the long-time operation in these high radiation fields, the interactions in the detector could 
produce modifications in their parameters, which eventually could attain unacceptable levels. 

Predictions of the degradation of silicon detectors in conditions of continuous irradiation, as will be the 
case of the next experiments in HEP, LHC and SLHC, are presented in Figure 5. Differences in the volume

density of the leakage current for FZ and DOFZ detectors exist only at short times (in the first year), and 
the benefit of oxygenation, for 0 OC operation, is not seen in Neff both in the environment of LHC and of 
SLHC. In what regards the effective trapping probabilities, these are higher in oxygenated materials. They 
present a linear dependence for electrons, and a relatively quick saturation for holes. The predictions for the 
effective trapping probabilities for DOFZ material and for holes are probably overestimated. 

If  SiFFCD  is  a  defect  stable  in  time  as  the  model  supposes,  in  conditions  of  continuous  irradiation,  the 

accumulation of this defect will produce a strong degradation of the parameters of devices.

4. Summary 
 
In this contribution, the correlations between microscopic mechanisms of degradation and macroscopic 
effects induced by irradiation, and the role of SiFFCD in these phenomena have been investigated. Because 
the background radiation field at LHC and SLHC will be an important source of production of defects, the 
expected degradation of silicon detectors has also been estimated.

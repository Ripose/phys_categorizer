Abstract 

Convective downbursts are known to produce potentially hazardous weather 

conditions.  Currently, severity indices are used to estimate the strength of a potential 

downburst, but this information does not readily translate to the variables affected by 

downburst events. The effects of downbursts are often associated with aviation because 

of rapid changes in wind direction and speed, but can also be observed in marine 

conditions.  Three recently observed downburst events have been selected as case studies 

to evaluate the effects of the downbursts on the marine environment.  The information 

gathered on these events includes wind speed, gusts and direction at the surface, air 

temperature and pressure, water level, and Wet Microburst Severity Index (WMSI) 

values.  The events selected occurred at Tolchester Beach, MD, on September 28, 2006 at 

23:06 GMT, North Jetty, near Galveston, TX, on October 13, 2006 at 2:48 GMT, and 

again at North Jetty on October 27, 2006 at 5:30 GMT.  Correlation between the WMSI 

values, the maximum wind gust, and the change in water level is suggested. 

 

Introduction 

A downburst is a powerful downdraft produced by a convective storm that causes 

damaging winds for five to thirty minutes.  (Fujita, 1985) Once identified, downbursts 

can be divided into two categories, microburst and macroburst.  Winds from a microburst 

are horizontally limited (less than four kilometers), meaning that a smaller area is 

affected but also that higher wind speeds may result.  Winds from a macroburst spread 

farther than four kilometers but are more limited in wind speed.  (Fujita, 1985) 

Downbursts are also divided into categories based on their execution such as traveling or 

stationary, wet or dry, or radial or twisting.  Wet microbursts are distinguished from dry 

ones by the presence of heavy rain between the onset and offset of high wind gusts.  

(Wakimoto, 1985) 

The effects of downbursts are often associated with aviation, but can also be 

observed in marine conditions.  These conditions may include wind speed and direction 

at the surface, waves generated and their height, or water level changes.  A downburst is 

capable of temporarily pushing these factors to their extremes, causing a potential hazard 

to property or human lives.  Small craft such as water taxis or recreational vessels are 

very susceptible to high wind speeds and other factors that are intensified by the wind.  A 

downburst is predictable for only a short time span and greatly enhances winds already 

being produced by a convective storm.  This means that within a moderate storm a craft 

can be surprised by sudden high wind speeds. 

Schwab (1978) concluded that changes in water level are affected heavily by wind 

speeds and that using wind speed forecast data it is possible to make predictions of storm 

surges with significant accuracy.  Although pressure gradients are also associated with 

changes in water level, especially storm surge, wind speed has a greater effect than do 

pressure gradients when creating a storm surge in shallow areas, such as the port areas 

investigated in this paper.  Although water level data is modified to ignore the normally 

insignificant oscillations created by waves, convective winds will bring waves to more 

hazardous heights as the water level increases.  A downburst is not able to produce winds 

for a long enough period to cause a major storm surge, but the presence of a significant 

water level increase suggests that wave height and severity also increase. 

The WMSI was developed by Pryor and Ellrod (2004) to predict the maximum 

wind gusts of a microburst resulting from convective activity.  The index is calculated 

using the Theta-e deficit (TeD), representing downburst formation, and the convective 

available potential energy (CAPE), representing updraft strength.  (Pryor and Ellrod, 

2004)  This index, when used to predict microburst strength, can be indirectly used to 

predict the subsequent rise in recorded water level after a microburst has occurred. 

 

Methodology 

 

Several resources were used to monitor downburst events and create a data set of 

the conditions.  The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) displays high wind, tornado, and hail 

reports, and is used to locate areas of convective activity and high winds.  Once an area 

of convective activity is identified, more specific observation programs are used.  The 

Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS) is a system of monitoring stations 

within certain port areas in the U.S. that records marine and some weather conditions.  

The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) provides data similar to that from PORTS, but 

also shows the data from other observation systems in addition to its own.  The data from 

these two sources is evaluated to determine whether or not a downburst did occur.  It is 

also necessary to verify the presence of convective activity at the time of the downburst.  

This is done using NEXRAD data from the National Climatic Data Center at the time of 

the downburst event.   

The WMSI is used to estimate microburst wind speeds should an event occur.  

Data values for the WMSI are recorded by the microburst product imagery provided by 

the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) using 

Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imagery and sounding data.  

WMSI images used in this study were generated with the magnification centered on the 

appropriate PORTS or NDBC station.  The WMSI images are updated hourly and are not 

generated for some specific hours; therefore the closest WMSI values in time and 

location were recorded for this study. 

 

 

Case 1: Tolchester Beach, MD 

The data for this event was recorded by a PORTS station on September 28, 2006.  

The highest wind gust recorded was 49 knots at 23:06 GMT, followed by measurements 

of 43 and 35 knots at 23:12 and 23:18 GMT respectively.  The water level measurement 

increased from 2.22 feet at 23:00 GMT to a peak of 3.16 feet at 23:24 GMT, and then fell 

back to 2.25 feet at 23:42 GMT.  The air temperature falls from 73.94 oF at 23:00 GMT 

to 61.34 oF at 23:06 GMT, a 12.6 oF decrease.  The wind direction changes from 150o at 

23:00 GMT to 276o at 23:06 GMT, a 126o difference.  The air pressure increases from 

1004.1 mb at 23:00 GMT to 1006.4 mb at 23:12 GMT, an increase of 2.3 mb.  These 

results are graphed over a 3 day period automatically by PORTS (Fig. 1).

The WMSI values were collected at 22:00 GMT. The closest value to the location of the 

downburst was 45 (Fig. 2).  The downburst occurred while a large storm passed over the 

northern Chesapeake Bay region.  A radar image of the area at 23:06 GMT verifies the 

convective activity (Fig. 3).

Case 2: North Jetty, TX 

The data for this event was collected from the PORTS station at North Jetty, TX, 

on October 13, 2006.  A NDBC station also recorded supporting text data during this 

event, but part of the event is not recorded because data for 2:48 and 2:54 GMT is not 

recorded. The highest wind gust recorded was 35 knots at 2:54 GMT, which followed a 

measurement of 31 knots at 2:48 GMT.  The water level measurement was under the 

predicted value since 13:18 GMT on October 10, 2006.  However, it increased from 1.91 

feet (0.08 below the predicted level) at 2:42 GMT to a peak of 2.28 feet (0.23 feet above 

the predicted level) at 3:06 GMT, and then fell back to 1.96 feet (0.17 feet below the 

predicted level) at 4:48 GMT.  The air temperature falls from 78.44 oF at 2:36 GMT to 

69.98 oF at 2:48 GMT, an 8.46 oF decrease.  The wind direction changes from 131o at 

2:36 GMT to 2o at 2:42 GMT, a 133o difference.  The pressure increased from 1009.4 mb 

at 2:30 GMT to 1010.1 mb at 2:42 GMT, a 0.7 mb increase.  These results are graphed 

over a 3 day period automatically by PORTS (Fig. 4).

activity (Fig. 6). 

The WMSI values were collected at 2:00 GMT. The closest value to the location of the 

downburst was 77 (Fig. 5).  The downburst occurred as a squall line passed near the 

station over the Gulf.  A radar image of the area at 3:48 GMT verifies the convective

Case 3: North Jetty, TX 

 

The data for this event was collected from the PORTS station at North Jetty, TX, 

on October 27, 2006.  The downburst began with a recorded wind gust of 30 knots at 

5:30 GMT and escalates to the highest wind gust recorded, 41 knots, at 5:36 GMT.  The 

water level increased from 2.17 feet at 5:24 GMT to a peak of 2.31 feet at 5:36 GMT, and 

then fell back to 1.98 feet at 6:12 GMT.  The air temperature falls from 76.10 oF at 5:24 

GMT to 68.18 oF at 5:42 GMT, a 7.92 oF decrease.  The wind direction changes from 

179o at 5:24 GMT to 247o at 5:36 GMT, a 68o difference.  The pressure increased from 

1007.2 mb at 5:24 GMT to 1008.0 mb at 5:36 GMT, a 0.8 mb increase.  These results are 

graphed over a 3 day period automatically by PORTS (Fig. 7).

The WMSI values were collected at 5:00 GMT. The closest value to the location of the 

downburst was 84 (Fig. 8).  The downburst occurred as a bow echo passed over the 

station towards the Gulf.  A radar image of the area at 5:36 GMT verifies the convective 

activity (Fig. 9).

been enhanced to show cloud top temperatures.  The blue regions of clouds are between roughly -80 and -100 degrees Celsius, and it 
can be inferred that these reach the greatest altitude.

Discussion 

 

 

 

The physical characteristics highlighted in this paper serve two purposes.  The 

first is verification of microburst events.  By looking at changes in factors of wind gust, 

wind direction, air temperature, and pressure, it is possible to determine the occurrence of 

a microburst.  However, it is important to note that microbursts have a short duration, and 

therefore if these factors are sustained over long periods of time (more than thirty 

minutes) it is more likely an indication of storm activity. 

A relatively high wind gust is one of the first signs observed in data recordings to 

identify a microburst event.  The downbursts examined in this paper all reached wind 

gusts of thirty-five knots or more, although microbursts have been recorded at wind gusts 

little over 20 knots. (Geerts, 2000) A change in wind direction is also observed during a 

downburst event.  The downbursts at Tolchester on September 28, 2006 and at North 

Jetty on October 13, 2006 have very large wind direction changes, both over one-hundred 

degrees. 

Rapid air temperature decreases are another sign of downburst activity.  The best 

representation of this is in the event at North Jetty on October 27, 2006.  It appears that 

there may have actually been two events based on the wind patterns and the appearance 

of two sharp drops in temperature. The events at North Jetty studied in this paper both 

have temperature drops of roughly eight degrees in a only six to twelve minutes and the 

observed temperature at Tolchester dropped twelve degrees in the same amount of time.  

The drops in both cases are significant and can be attributed to a downburst event. 

Pressure is also observed in each event rapidly increasing.  It is expected that the 

pressure will rise between two millibars and five millibars. (Carcena, “Microbursts-…”) 

Tolchester event reaches this expected interval.  However, the events at North Jetty 

exhibit relatively low pressure increases.  It is possible that the monitoring stations were 

not close enough to the downburst to record the complete pressure difference produced 

by the downburst.  Despite the small size of the increase observed for these two events, 

the pattern of a pike surrounded by two troughs is present, which supports the idea that 

distance prevented the station from observing the full magnitude of the difference. 

The other purpose of the observed physical characteristics is to serve as a 

comparison to the resulting marine conditions, which in this study are the changes in 

observed water level.  In each case the maximum wind gust, the increase in water level, 

and the WMSI value are analyzed.  Because of geographical difference, the Tolchester 

case and the two North Jetty cases are separated in some aspects of the analysis. 

The Tolchester WMSI value is considerably lower than expected.  A 49 knot wind 

is predicted theoretically by WMSI values of roughly 79.  The recorded value of 45, 

however, predicts wind speeds of less than 35 knots based on the existing statistical 

relationship.  This discrepancy can possibly be explained by two factors.  The first is the 

geographic factor mentioned previously.  When validating the WMSI, Pryor and Ellrod 

(2004) noted that the threshold used by the WMSI would require tuning between 

geographic regions.  The other factor is that the GOES data is not available in thicker 

cloud cover, which is generally associated with convective activity.  The closest WMSI 

value recorded may not be an accurate measurement of the event. 

The two events at North Jetty have expected WMSI values.  Although, like the 

Tolchester event, the WMSI values are not observed directly over the recording stations, 

it is clear in these images that the TeD and CAPE are at a significant level for wet 

microburst activity. 

For the Tolchester case this difference is quite significant, roughly 0.84 feet.  The 

two events at North Jetty are less, but also had very different wind speed conditions.  The 

event on October 13, 2006 had only a max wind gust of 35 knots, which accounts for its 

0.31 increase in water level.  The October 27 event, however, only has about a 0.17 

increase despite a 41 knot wind gust.  This is most likely due to the elevated winds 

observed prior to the downburst event.  The Tolchester and October 13 events both 

followed sustained winds of roughly 10 knots with gusts only a few knots higher.  The 

October 27 event followed winds of 15 knots or more with 20 knot gusts, meaning that 

wave activity was already increased and resulted in less of an observed effect from the 

microburst winds.  Another factor that illuminates this result is the irregular water level 

observations occurring after the downburst event.  The water level oscillates a great deal 

and it is possible that although the microburst winds did not cause a significant increase 

in water level, they may have sustained a much higher water level than that which would 

have otherwise occurred.  The water level decreases by 0.33 feet shortly after the 

downburst occurred, suggesting that in the absence of the downburst the water level 

would have already fallen. 

 

Conclusion 

 

 

 

There are several possible results of wet microburst activity in marine 

environments discussed in this paper.  It is clear that the short duration of a microburst 

allows for significant increases in water level.  With this information comes the 

possibility of significant increases in wave activity as well, which is a key hazard to 

marine craft, especially in port areas.  Wind speeds of 35 to 40 knots are shown to be 

capable of water level differences of four inches over a 10 to 15 minute period.  Wind 

speeds of 45 to 50 knots over the same time period are capable of much larger increases, 

observed in this paper between 0.8 and 0.9 feet.  WMSI values that predict wind gusts of 

35 to 50 knots are between 50 and 80.  (Pryor and Ellrod, 2004)  When observing values 

within this interval or above it, at least a four inch increase in water level can be expected 

in the event of a convective downburst.  Wind speeds and water level changes resulting 

from convective downbursts are shown to produce noticeable and potentially hazardous 

conditions for marine craft.

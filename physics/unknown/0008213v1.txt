Abstract

The  high  energy  beam  transport  (HEBT)  line  for  the
ISAC  radioactive  beam  facility  at  TRIUMF  requires  an
11.8 MHz buncher. The main requirements of the buncher
are to operate in cw  mode  with a velocity acceptance of
2.2%  and  an  effective  voltage  of  100  kV,  which  for  a
three gap buncher gives a drift tube voltage of 30 kV. A
lumped element circuit is more suitable than a distributed
rf  structure  for  this  low  frequency  of  operation.  The
resonant  frequency  of  11.8  MHz  is  obtained  by  an
inductive coil in parallel with the capacitance of the drift
tube. The coil is housed in a dust free box at atmospheric
pressure  whereas  the  drift  tube  is  placed  in  a  vacuum
chamber  and  an  rf  feedthrough  connects  them.  Two
design of this feedthrough, one using disk and one using
tubular ceramics, operating at 30 kV rf, are described in
this  paper.  MAFIA  and  SUPERFISH  codes  are  used  to
simulate  the  fields  in  the  feedthroughs,  particularly
around  the  ceramic  metal  interfaces.  Test  results  of  the
prototype  feedthroughs  are  presented  and  the  choice  of
the proposed final solution is outlined.

1    INTRODUCTION

The  beam  from  the  DTL  of  the  ISAC  radioactive  beam
facility goes thru the high energy beam transport (HEBT)
and  is  delivered  to  various  target  stations.  The  DTL
produces    beams  fully  variable  in  energy  from  0.15-1.5
MeV/u with mass to charge values of 3 ≤ A/q ≤ 6. A low-
β 11.78 MHz buncher placed approximately 12  m  down
stream  from  the  DTL  can  provide  efficient 
initial
bunching for beams from 0.15-0.4 MeV/u [1]. The basic
parameters of the HEBT low-β buncher are given in Table
1.

The  maximum  required  effective  voltage  from 
the
buncher  is  100  kV.  For  a  3  gap  structure,  the  effective
voltage , Veff is given by Veff = 4 Vt To , where Vt is the
drift tube voltage and To is the transit time factor.

2    DESIGN

A  prototype  of  a  two  gap    structure  is  designed    to
produce  30  kV  tube  voltage  at  the  HEBT  buncher
frequency. Since the resonant frequency is low, a lumped
element  circuit  is  found  to  be  more  suitable  than  a
distributed  structure.    An  inductive  coil  in  parallel  with
the capacitance of the drift tube and  circuit capacitances
produces  the  desired    resonant  frequency.  The    coil,
shorted  at  one  end,  is  placed  in  a  dust  free  box.  Two
designs  of  feedthroughs  are  tested.  An  rf  feedthrough
connects the open end of the coil to the drift tube, which
is in a vacuum box. Two nose cones are also attached in
the  vacuum  box  to  simulate  the  gap  capacitance  of  the
HEBT buncher. The prototype buncher is  shown in Fig.
1.  Since 
to  be
approximately  700  watts,  the  coil  is  water  cooled.
Insulators support the coil to reduce vibration due to water
flow.

2.1   The coil

2.3   Tubular ceramic feedthrough

A  6  turn  coil  is  made  of  a  hollow  copper  tube  of  ‰(cid:148)
diameter.  Inductance  of  this  coil  is  6.1  (cid:181)H  with  turn-to-
turn spacing of 1.5(cid:148), coil diameter of 9(cid:148) and a coil length
of    15(cid:148).  A  …(cid:148)  hollow  tube  is  inserted  in  this  ‰(cid:148)  tube
before the coil is made. Water flows through this …(cid:148) tube
and flows  out from the ‰(cid:148) tube. The coil is installed in an
aluminum  box  20(cid:148)x20(cid:148)x24(cid:148)  and  the  water  inlet,  outlet
and coupling loop  are located on  top of this box.

2.2   Disk ceramic feedthrough

The disk feedthrough [2] uses a ceramic disk of 4.5(cid:148) outer
diameter  with  inner  hole  of  1.75(cid:148)  diameter  and  a
thickness of 0.375(cid:148). The ceramic is not metalized and it is
held in position by bolting two halves of both  inner  and
outer conductors as shown in Fig. 2. Helicoflex rings are
used for vacuum seal between  ceramic and the metal
parts. In case of window failure, only the ceramic need  be
replaced and the metal parts can be reused. The MAFIA
static  solver  is  used  to  design  the  contour  of  the  metal
around the ceramic and is shown in Fig. 3
.

Figure 4: Tubular ceramic in a coaxial housing

 The  tubular  feedthrough  uses  an  Alumina  ceramic  from
Jennings,  which  has  an  outer  diameter  of    2.38(cid:148)  and  a
length of  3.5(cid:148) and is metalized at the edges. The ceramic
assembly in a coaxial housing is shown in Fig. 4.  Corona
shields are incorporated in the design  near the ceramic to
metal  joints.  A  SUPERFISH  simulation  is  used  to
optimize the shape of the electrodes around the ceramic.
Fig. 5 shows the electric field distribution in the ceramic
and on the corona shields.

2.3   Insulating support for the coil

Since the coil is water cooled, it needs to be supported in
order to reduce the vibration induced by the water flow. A
polycarbonate  material  known  as  Lexan,  is  used  as  an

Figure 3:MAFIA plot of e-fields

insulator  to  support  the  coil.  Tests  shows  that  it  can
withstand  high  dc  voltage  and  has  low  rf  losses  at  the
design frequency of the buncher. Unfortunately, it breaks
down when rf is maintained for a while and   catches fire
and carbonizes. The mechanism of failure of Lexan under
rf  operation  is  not  fully  understood.  This  material  is
abandoned and a 2(cid:148) diameter Teflon rod is used instead.

3    RF MEASUREMENTS

3.1   Signal level

The feedthroughs are assembled and connected to the coil,
which  is  housed  in  the  dust  free  box.  The  tubular
feedthrough with the coil connected  shows a Q of 1920
and  a  shunt  impedance  of  685  kΩ  at  11.975  MHz.  The
capacitance  of 
to  be
approximately  27  pF.  The  disk  feedthrough  in  parallel
with the same coil shows a rather low Q value of 50. This
implies that the ceramic is contaminated and further test is
abandoned  until  the  cause  of  such  contamination  is
understood.

is  measured 

3.2   Power

The power test is done  with the tubular  feedthrough and
the coil. The water cooling of the coil is extended to the
ceramic-metal joint and the  flow is 16 liters/minute. The
vacuum of the test box is 2.10-7  Torr  without rf applied. A
1  kW  solid  state  amplifier  is  used  for  the  test.  A  4.5(cid:148)
diameter loop installed inside the coil at the short circuit
end,  is used to couple power. The loop can be turned to
provide  50  Ω  matching  of  the  power  amplifier  and  the
resonant circuit.  Under cw operation, 30 kV at the drift
tube at 11.975 MHz is maintained for 6 hours without any
breakdown or interruption. The maximum temperature on
the  ceramic  is  measured  to  be  38  degrees  C.  Measured
values are shown in Table 2.

The drift tube voltage is calibrated by measuring emitted
x-rays. A glass window is provided in the test box for this
purpose. Also, rf pick  up  probes are calibrated with the
measured  shunt  impedance.  Fig.  6  shows  the  measured
tube voltage with input rf power varying from 800 watts
to  1000  watts.  This  shows  excellent  agreement  of  the
measured voltage with x-ray and rf pick up probes.

4   CONCLUSION

Since  no  commercial    rf  feedthrough  is  available  which
can withstand the 30 kV rf voltage at 11.8 MHz under cw
mode, it has been decided to develop such a feedthrough
at  TRIUMF.  The  prototype  tests  have  shown  excellent
high voltage performance of the tubular feedthrough. This
will be used to design the final HEBT low-β buncher. The
3  gap  HEBT  buncher  requires  two  parallel  circuits,
consisting of two  rf feedthroughs and two coils tuned to
the  same  frequency.  Hence,  two  fine  tuners  will  be
required  for  the  operation  of  the  buncher.  A  single
coupling loop driven by a 2 kW power amplifier will be
adequate.

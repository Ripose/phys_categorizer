We  present  initial  results  on  the  realization  of  an  all  taper  coupled  multicolor  microspherical 

glass  light  source  fabricated  from  the  erbium  doped  fluoride  glass  ZBLALiP.    Whispering 

gallery  mode  lasing  and  upconversion  processes  give rise to laser and fluorescent emissions at 

multiple wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the infrared.  A single-mode tapered fiber coupling 

scheme,  which  serves  to  both  launch  pump  light at 980 nm into the microresonator cavity and 

collect the resulting infrared lasing, is employed.  We demonstrate the use of a second separate 

fiber taper to outcouple the upconversion spectrum over several hundred nanometers.  Thirteen 

discrete  emissions  ranging  from  320  to  850  nm  have  been  observed  in  the  upconversion 

spectrum.    The  processes  responsible  for  the  generation  of  the  observed  wavelengths  are 

outlined.

In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the exploitation of upconversion mechanisms in 

rare-earth ion doped materials to yield a range of wavelengths from near infrared to ultraviolet.   

One such class of device which has shown interesting optical properties is the rare-earth doped 

microspherical  whispering  gallery  mode  laser.1,2    These  miniature  resonant  cavities  offer 

appealing advantages for applications in laser engineering due to their small size of several tens 

of  microns  in  diameter,  high-Q  whispering  gallery  modes  reaching  1010  and  small  mode 

volumes.3    The  close  proximity  of  numerous  energy  levels  in  triply-ionized  rare  earth  ions  is 

advantageous  for  obtaining  fluorescence  through  various  upconversion  mechanisms  such  as 

excited  state  absorption  (ESA),  energy  transfer  upconversion  (ETU)  and  photon  avalanche 

(PA).4  This combination of interesting active medium and resonant cavity has resulted in much 

research  focusing  on  the  characterization  of  doped  microspheres.    We  report  here  on  the 

realization  of  an  all  taper  coupled  multiwavelength  microspherical  light  source  based  on  the 

upconversion  emissions  from  an  erbium-doped  ZBLALiP  (ZrF4-BaF2-LaF3-AlF3-LiF-PbF2) 

fluoride  glass  microsphere.    Emissions  from  the  ultraviolet  to  the  infrared  are  observed  and 

outcoupled and in particular we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first observation of 320 

nm upconversion emission following 980 nm pumping of Er3+ and the first use of a fiber taper to 

outcouple the upconversion spectrum over several hundred nanometers.  

  The Er:ZBLALiP (refractive index 1.49 at 1550 nm) microspheres studied for this work 

contain erbium at a concentration of 0.2 mol%, which equates to 4×1019 Er3+ ions/cm3.  It should 

be noted that, at this concentration, energy transfer (ET) is not expected to play a major role and 

as such excited state absorption (ESA) is the dominant mechanism in the upconversion process.5  

Nevertheless, due to the non-trivial problem of distinguishing the two mechanisms, some authors 

 

2

have suggested that ET may play a role even when the dopant concentration is below the critical 

value of about 1 mol%.6,7,8  A systematic study to distinguish between the two will be presented 

in  a  future  paper  and  we  suggest  here  the  most  likely  transitions  responsible  for  the  observed 

spectrum.  The suitability of fluoride glasses as rare-earth host materials has long been known9 

as  their  low  phonon  energies  determine  multiphonon  relaxation  rates  and,  ultimately,  the 

efficiency  of  upconversion  processes.    The  material  studied  here  has  improved  stability  with 

respect  to  similar  fluorozirconate  glasses  and  has  been  shown  by  Mortier  et  al.10  to  be  an 

excellent host for rare-earth ions.   

In  our  work,  the  C-band  lasing  characteristics  and  upconversion  spectrum  have  been 

investigated at room temperature using a single mode 980 nm laser diode pump with a spectral 

width  of  about  1  nm  and  under  CW  pumping  conditions.    A  detailed  description  of  the 

experimental approach is given elsewhere.11  To achieve efficient coupling of the pump into the 

microsphere  and  efficient  collection  of  the  infrared  lasing  spectrum,  a  1550  nm  SMF-28  fiber 

was adiabatically tapered to 1 µm diameter using a direct heating technique.12  The transmission 

loss of these tapers is typically less than 0.1 dB/cm.  Optimum mechanical alignment of the taper 

and microsphere is achieved by traversing the microsphere to different locations along the taper 

until  the  microsphere  emission  spectrum  about  1550  nm  is  maximized.    This  spectrum  is 

recorded  by  connecting  one  end  of  the  pump  fiber  taper  to  an  optical  spectrum  analyzer.    The 

transmission through the pump fiber is also monitored during the alignment and typically 10–15 

% of the pump light is coupled into the microsphere.  This coupling efficiency is in part due to 

the broad spectral nature of the pump laser relative to the whispering gallery mode resonances of 

the  microsphere  and  can  be  improved  by  the  use  of  a  narrow  linewidth  pump  source.13   

Characteristic whispering gallery mode bands about the sphere equator are also observed.  The 

 

3

upconversion spectrum is detected in two ways.  The first is via the use of a second fiber taper 

located on the microsphere equator diametrically opposed to the pump fiber taper, as shown in 

the inset to Fig. 1.  This detection fiber taper is non-adiabatic, 2 µm diameter,  fabricated from 

multimode  fiber  (Thorlabs  AFS50/125Y)  and  is  connected  to  a  spectrometer  with  0.4  nm 

spectral resolution.  We employ the two taper system as it enables us to simultaneously detect the 

lasing  emissions  about  1550  nm  via  the  pump  taper  and  the  upconversion  emissions  via  the 

second multimode fiber taper.  This technique allows us to study the competition between both 

sets  of  processes.    The  second  method  relies  on  the  use  of  a  high  numerical  aperture  fiber 

coupled spectrometer to detect the free space scattering spectrum from the microsphere.   

Successful  excitation  of  the  4I13/2→4I15/2  transition  results  in  whispering  gallery  mode 

lasing  resonances  within  the  microsphere  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.    The  microsphere  eccentricity, 

given by

 where l and m are the angular mode numbers, and ωnml 

is the angular frequency of the mode, is calculated to be ~2.1 % for

 with corresponding 

azimuthal mode splitting, ∆ωecc, of ~11 GHz.  Analysis of the lasing peaks enables us to measure 

the free spectral range (FSR),  FSRν , between successive mode groups with difference in angular 

mode number l of 1, to be ~7.8 nm (0.97 THz).  This agrees closely with the calculated value of

 ~7.9 nm (0.96 THz), indicating a microsphere diameter, D ≈ 66 µm as expected.  

It can be seen that each group of modes contains four distinct lasing peaks which are thought to 

be  due  to  the  excitation  of  multiple  radial  modes  in  the  sphere.    The  peak  power  of  a  single 

outcoupled  lasing  peak  presented  here  is  ~30  nW,  which  is  about  a  factor  of  10  less  than  the 

maximum observed by us.  The spacing between TE and TM modes ( TETMν ) in Fig. 1 (6.8 nm) 

also agrees well with the calculated value of 6.4 nm.  The loaded cavity Q is typically 2–5×104 

 

4

and is measured as the FWHM of an individual lasing peak.  This value is limited by the finite 

spectrometer resolution of 0.07 nm. 

The  Er:ZBLALiP  upconversion  spectrum  recorded  coincidently  to  the  lasing  spectrum 

(Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 2.  Thirteen discrete peaks have been noted in the scattering spectrum 

(Fig.  2(a))  and  numbered  from  T1-T13.    Approximately  700  µW  of  980  nm  pump  light  was 

coupled  into  the  microsphere.    The  detection  efficiency  of  the  upconversion  outcoupling  taper 

has not been optimized, and this combined with increased fiber attenuation towards wavelengths 

shorter  than  about  500  nm,  results  in  transitions  T1  and  T5  not  being  resolved  in  the  taper 

spectrum  (Fig.  2(b)).    The  transitions  have  initially  been  identified  on  the  basis  of  the  erbium 

energy  level  diagram  shown  in  Fig.  3  and  on  the  accepted  Er3+  emission  wavelengths  in  the 

literature.    The  centre  wavelength  associated  with  each  transition  is  shown  in  Fig.  3.    Further 

understanding of the transition(s) responsible for a particular wavelength can be obtained by the 

intensity  dependence  behavior  of  the  fluorescence  at  a  particular  wavelength.    In  the  case  of 

ESA, the dependence of the fluorescence intensity upon pump power usually exhibits a simple 

power  law  dependence  with  slope  n  equal  to  the  number  of  photons  absorbed.    Preliminary 

measurements have, for example, yielded a slope corresponding to n = 1.5 for transitions 6 (T6) 

and 7 (T7) whereas a slope of 2 is expected.   This can be understood as depletion of the  4I15/2 

ground  state.14    The  limited  resolution  of  the  spectrometer  used  to  study  the  upconversion 

combined with the smaller microsphere FSR at shorter wavelengths means that the whispering 

gallery  mode  structure  is  only  visible  for  emissions  at  wavelengths  longer  than  about  800  nm. 

The mode structure for the 849 nm (T13) emission is distinguishable in the inset of Fig. 2(a). 

Our results demonstrate a broad range of emission from 320 nm to 850 nm.  We suggest 

that the combination of high cavity quality factor (Q) and low whispering gallery mode volume 

 

5

serves to significantly enhance the probability of excited state absorption by enhancing the pump 

intensity within the microsphere.  This is reflected in the fact that a large number of the observed 

transitions  are  likely  the  result  of  3-  and  4-photon  absorption  events  for  what  is  a  relatively 

modest (sub mW) pump power coupled into the microsphere.  The emission line centered at 318 

nm  (T1)  is  most  likely  a  4-photon  process  populating  the  2P3/2  state,  which  in  turn  radiatively 

relaxes to the  4I15/2 ground state.  Three pump photons populate the  2G7/2 state.  The  2G7/2–2P3/2 

energy gap of ~3600 cm-1 combined with a phonon energy of 650 cm-1 is such that the 2P3/2 state 

is  unlikely  to  be  populated  by  energy  transfer  processes  e.g.  thermalization  and  as  such  we 

suggest the absorption of a fourth pump photon is necessary to explain T1.  This transition has 

previously been reported in Er3+-doped glass but was identified as a 3-photon process following 

pumping at 637 nm.15  The same authors also reported emissions corresponding to the transitions 

T3,  T4,  T7  and  T9.    Transition  T1  has  also  been  reported16  in  an  Yb3+-Er3+  co-doped  material 

although in that case the excitation process involved successive energy transfers from Yb3+.  It 

should be noted that this is very different from our work which involves a single dopant, does not 

rely  on  a  sensitizer  ion  and  in  which  ETU  does  not  play  a  major  role  due  to  the  low  dopant 

concentration.    The transitions 2P3/2→4I13/2 (T3) and 2P3/2→4I11/2 (T4) are also thought to involve 

4-photon excitation.  Xu and Jiang17 have observed transitions T1, T3 and T4 following pumping 

at 545 nm.  Transitions T6, T7, T12 and T13 have been reported following 980 nm pumping.18  

The ultra-violet line at 383 nm (T2) and the 492 nm emission (T5) have been reported under 973 

nm excitation.19  Arahira et al.20 observed Er3+ emission at 700 nm and have attributed it to the 

transition 4F7/2→4I13/2 following absorption of three pump photons at 1480 nm.  We presume this 

assignment  was  on  the  basis  of  the  3-photon  resonance  4F7/2→4I15/2.    We  have  also  observed 

emission  about  700  nm  (T11)  but  propose  it  to  follow  the  transition  2H9/2→4I11/2  based  on  the 

 

6

observed intensity ratio compared with the branching ratios calculated from Judd-Ofelt theory.21  

Finally  we  have  observed  emissions  centered  at  618  nm  (T8)  and  667  nm  (T10).  We  are 

presently unaware of other reports on such emissions from Er3+. 

In conclusion, we have demonstrated an all taper coupled multiwavelength upconversion 

microsphere  light  source  and  proposed  the  Er3+  transitions  involved.    We  have  used  tapered 

optical fibers to both pump the microsphere and collect the resulting upconversion and C-band 

lasing  emissions.    We  believe  this  to  be  the  first  use  of  fiber  tapers  to  outcouple  such  a  broad 

range  of  wavelengths  from  a  microspherical  light  source  and  that  this  device  could  find  many 

uses as a miniature all fiber multicolor light source.

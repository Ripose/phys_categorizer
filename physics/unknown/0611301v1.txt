Abstract:  Based  on  the  basic  theory  of  the  microfiber  loop  resonator,  we  exploit  the 

application  of  microfiber  loop  resonators  in  biochemical  sensing.  We  set  up  a  reliable 

theoretical  model  and  optimize  the  structural  parameters  of  microfiber  loop  resonators 

including the radius of the microrfiber, the radius of the loop and the length of the coupling 

region for higher sensitivity, wider dynamic measurement range, and lower detection limit. To 

show the convincible and realizable sensing ability we perform the simulation of sensing an 

extreme small variation of ambient refractive index by employing a set of experimental datas 

as  the  parameters  in  the  expression  of  intensity  transmission  coefficient,  and  the  detection 
limit reaches to a varation of ambient refractive index of 10-5 refractive index unit(RIU). This 

has superiority over the exsiting evanescent field-based subwavelength-diameter optical fiber 

refractive index sensor.

1. Introduction 

Recently optical waveguides with subwavelength diameter attract  much attention, especially 

optical  microfiber-based  photonic  devices[1-6].  Fabrication  methods  of  ultra-high-quality 

silica  optical  microfibers  with  length  up  to  ~10cm  and  diameter  down  to  ~30nm  have  been 

developed[2-3,6],  so  silica  optical  microfibers  are  promising  to  develop  micro-  and 

nanophotonic  devices.  Demonstrated  and  potential  applications  of  microfibers  include 

nonlinear  optics[3,7-8],  optical  sensing[9-11],  and  the  microfiber  loop  resonator(MLR)[12-

17].Compared  to  integrated  optical  waveguide  ring  resonators[18],  MLRs  are  more 

convenient  for  fabrication,  manipulation  and  application.  An  MLR  can  be  directly  obtained 

using  a  microfiber  manipulated  into  a  loop,  where  effective  coupling    occurs  between  the 

contact    sections  of    the  microfiber.  The  MLR  with  loaded  Q-factor  of  120000  has  been 

produced[16],  and  the  performance  is  close  to  that  of  integrated  waveguide  microring 

resonators of which  the largest Q-factor has been demonstrated recently[19].  

MLRs are also potential useful for optical filtering, active devices and optical sensing as 

the  integrated  waveguide  microring  resonators[18].  However,  the  research  on  MLRs  for 

biochemical sensing hasn’t been reported. In this paper, we simulate the response of MLRs to 

the variation of ambient refractive index and optimize the structural parameters of MLRs to 

provide  a  theoretical  guide  for  variant  requirements  in  practical  sensing  applications.  After 

that we perform the simulation based on a set of experimental datas in reference[16] to show 

the achievable sensing perfomance of MLRs.

2. Theory 

A. Fundamental s of an MLR 

A  typical  MLR  is  shown  in  Fig.  1(a).  A1,  A2,  B1  and  B2  are  the  complex  mode  amplitudes. 

Coupling of optical singal occurs in the region selected by the blue dashed line frame, where 

the  adjacent  microfibers  contact  and  parallel  with  each  other.  The  loop  can  be  treated  as  a 

cirlce, and then the length of the loop L is equal to 2πR, where R is the radius of the loop. 

For simplicity the polarization effect is ignored[16]. Based on the fact that fabrication of 

ultra-low-loss  silica  microfibers  with  length  up  to  ~10cm  and  uniform  diameter  has  been 

demonstrated[2-3,6], we can assume that the field distribution in the loop is independent on 

the  specific  axial  position  for  the  theoretical  simulation.  That  is  to  say,  both  propagation 

constant β and coupling coeffcient κ are constant funtions of the axial position.  

The  intensity  transmission  coeffcient  T,  representing  the  ratio  of  the  transimission 

intensity  to  the  input  intensity,  can  be  obtained  according  to  general  principle  of  ring 

resonators [16,22-23]and has the expression[16]

where  α  is  the  intensity  attenuation  coeffcient  (viz.  power  attenuation  coeffcient  for  this 

model), L is the length of the loop, φ is the roundtrip phase shift, Κ is the coupling parameter. 

For  the  field  distribution  in  the  microfiber  is  independent  on  the  axial  position  we  can  get  

φ=βL and Κ=κΔl, where Δl is the length of the coupling region. 

From  the  expression  of  T,  we  know  the  resonances  in  transmission  spectrum  generate 

when cos(φ) is equal to zero and the coupling parameter K is close to Kn=(2n+1)π/2, where n 

is an integer [16,22-23]. 

The  free  spectrum  range(FSR)  of  an  MLR,  which  is  defined  as  the  spacing  between 

adjacent resonant wavelengths, and the Q-factor of an MLR, which is defined as of resonant 

wavelength λ to the full width at half maximum of the corresponding resonance spectrum, can 

be respectively expressed as when

B.  Sensing parameters 

The sensing mechanism of MLR-based biochemical sensors is based on the shift of resonant 

wavelength λr due to a variation of ambient refractive index caused by varied ambient material 

concentration, and it is illustrated in Fig.1(b). The microfiber is so thin that fractional optical 

power transimits in the ambient cladding [9]. As the refractive index of ambient material na 

changes the effective index of the guided modes in the microfiber neff  is modified, and then 

the resonant wavelength shifts. 

Following the sensing mechanism the sensitivity can be defined as[20]

Another important parameter for sensing applications is the detection limit δna. According 

to the definition of sensitivity the detection limit has the feature

where δλr is the spectral resolution of the measurement system. Theoretically the higher S is, 

the smaller the detection limit is. However, in fact it is very difficult to exactly obtain the shift 

of  the  resonant  wavelength  if  the  spectrum  width  is  large,  for  the  experimental  line  shape 

usually doesn’t agree with the theoretical line shape so well. So only if the Q-factor is high 

enough the low detection limit can be achievable, and we define the detection limit factor P 

=Q·S[20] to characterize the detection limit. The larger P is, the lower the detection limit is. 

3.  Optimization  of  the  structural  parameters  of  the  MLR  for  ambient  refractive  index 

sening 

From (2), (3) and (4) we know that the sensing parameters sensitivity and detection limit are 

determined by several key structural parameters of the MLR: the radius of the microfiber a, 

the  radius  of  the  loop  R  and  the  length  of  the  coupling  region  Δl,  so  we  perform  our 

simulations to optimize these parameters for high-performance sensing. 

The  operation  wavelength  is  set  in  ~1.55μm,  and  we  choose  the  radius  of  microfibers 

ranging  from  0.3μm  to  0.55μm  to  satisfy  single  mode  operation  and  low  loss  for  our 

simulations. 

For the instrinsic loss of microfibers is ultra low we only consider the attenuation due to 

bend loss for α[21]. κ can be obatained from the coupled-mode theory[16,21]. 

At first we pay attention to the sensitivity. From (3) the sensitivity is related to the raidus 

of  the  microfiber  and  the  loop.  The  results  shown  in  Fig.2(a)  indicate  that  the  sensitivity 

increases as the raidus of the microfiber decreases, and hardly changes with the raidus of the 

loop. Microfibers with smller raidus have higher fractional power transimitting in the ambient 

cladding, and then are more sensitive to the variation of ambient refractive index. As to the 

radius of the loop, ∂neff /∂na in (3) is independent on R, and ∂λr/∂neff  in (3) is hardly dependent 

on  R,  which  can  be  understood  from  the  first  resonacne  condition.  Moreover,  from(4)  the 
theoretical detection limit is  a variation of ~10-6 RIU based on an optical spectrum analyser 

with the resolution of 1pm as the measurement apparatus. 

For  sensing  applications,  wide  dynamic  measurement  range  is  also  important,  and  it  is 

related to the FSR based on this sensing mechanism. From the definition FSR is independent 

on  the  coupling  parameter,  and  its  evolution  trend  is  shown  in  Fig. 2(b).  Small a  and  R  are 

necessary to obtain larger FSR, and R is the dominant factor ,which can be understood from 

the definition of FSR.

Q-factor  is  the  most  important  parameter  for  a  resonator  for  it  characterizes  the 

perfomance of a resonator. Though the asymptotic formula of power attenuation coeffcient α 

isn’t so accurate when the radius of the loop is very small (e.g. a~10μm)[4], it is still reliable 

to simulate the evolution trend of the Q-factor and the detection limit factor P as the structural 

parameters of the MLR change.  

From (3) we know Q-factor depends on a, R and Δl. The resluts shown in Fig.3(a) indicate 

that higher Q-factor corresponds to large R and large a. In fact the Q-factor linearly depends 

on  R  if  we  use  conventional  linear  scale  instead  of  logarithm  scale,  and  this  is  similar  to 

integrated waveguide microring resonators [24]. High Q-factor also can be obtained based on 

large  a  for  corresponding  lower  loss  when  R  is  large.  The  coupling  length  Δl  is  another 

important parameter that affects the Q-factor. The coupling parameter Κ is periodic function 
of  Δl,  and  (Κ-Κn)2  is  the  same.  So  Q-factor  is  modified  periodically  as  the  coupling  length 
variates. We come to a conclusion that the coupling length Δl which makes Κ close to Κn is 

necessary to obtain higher Q-factor.

At last the detection limit factor is caculated. It is shown in Fig.4 that the evolution trend 

of detection limit factor is similar to that of Q-factor. Lower detection limit can be obtained by 

choosing  large  a,  large  R  and  appropriate  Δl.  According  to  the  preceding  discussion  the 

detection limit is in the inverse ratio of both Q-factor and the sensitivity. However, these two 

parameters have inverse dependences on the radius of the microfiber, so we should to find a 

balance between them. The results indicate that the detection limit factor has similar trend to 

that  of  the Q-factor.  That  is  to  say,  the  Q-factor  is  the dominant  parameter  for  affecting  the 

detection limit. 

Based  on  the  foregoing  simulations  we  find  the  structural  parameters  of  MLRs  which 

correspond to better sensing performance following our variant practical requirements. 

 

 

4. Simulation of sensing an extreme small variation of ambient refractive index 

To show the convincible and realizable sensing ability we perform the simulation employing a 

set of experimental datas in reference[16] as the parameters in equation (1). The radius of the 

microfiber is 0.45μm and the length of the loop is 2mm. Corresponding roundtrip attenuation 

αL  is  0.14  and  amplitude  coupling  coefficient  sin(K)  is  0.981  with  operation  wavelength 

~1.55μm [16]. The resolution of an optical spectrum analyser is 1pm, so we can obtain that 
the detection limit of this MLR-based sensor is an ambient refractive index variation of 10-5 

RIU from the simulation results shown in Fig.5. It is indicated that the MLR-based sensor has 

superiority  over  the  exsiting  evanescent  field-based  subwavelength-diameter  optical  fiber 
refractive  index  sensor  of  which  the  detection  limit  is  a  variation  of  ~104RIU[11].  As  the 

improvement of fabrication technology of MLRs, we believe the theoretical detection limit of 
~10-6RIU is achievable.

5. Conclusion 

We simulate the dependence of sensing performance on the structural parameters of  MLRs 

and conclude that higher Q-factor corresponds to large a, large R and appropriate Δl, higher  

sensitivity which is hardly dependent on R corresponds to small a, and lower detection limit 

corresponds  to  large  a,  large  R  and  appropriate  Δl.  After  that  we  perform  the  simulation  of 

sensing ambient refractive index according to a set of experimental datas in reference[16] to 

show  the  reachable  sensing  ability  of  the  MLR-based  sensor,  and  the  results  indicate  the 
detection  limit  reaches  to  a  variation  of  10-5 RIU.  It  precedes  the  demonstrated  submicron-

diameter  optical  fiber  refractive  index  sensor.  It  is  indicated  that  the  microfiber  loop 

resonator-based biochemical sensor is a kind of promising photonic device.

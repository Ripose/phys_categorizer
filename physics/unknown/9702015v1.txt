Abstract

In this paper, we study Lie superalgebras of 2 × 2 matrix-valued
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators on the complex line. We ﬁrst com-
pletely classify all such superalgebras of ﬁnite dimension. Among the
ﬁnite-dimensional superalgebras whose odd subspace is nontrivial, we
ﬁnd those admitting a ﬁnite-dimensional invariant module of smooth
vector-valued functions, and classify all the resulting ﬁnite-dimension-
al modules. The latter Lie superalgebras and their modules are the
building blocks in the construction of QES quantum mechanical mod-
els for spin 1/2 particles in one dimension.

1 Introduction

The discovery of quasi-exactly solvable (QES) spectral problems over the past
decade has been a continuous source of interesting mathematical problems.
The characteristic feature of a QES Hamiltonian is that a nontrivial portion
of its spectrum, but not necessarily all of it, can be computed algebraically.
Thus, QES spectral problems occupy an intermediate position between ex-
actly solvable problems, whose spectrum can be completely described, and
the vast majority of non-solvable ones. Lie algebras of diﬀerential operators
have been used extensively to generate physically interesting QES Schr¨o-
dinger operators, [14], [15], [16]; see also the review book [17]. The basic
idea underlying the application of Lie algebras of diﬀerential operators to
constructing QES models can be summarized as follows: if g is a Lie alge-
bra of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators with an invariant ﬁnite-dimensional
g-module of smooth fuctions N , then any scalar Hamiltonian H = −∆ + V
which can be expressed as a quadratic combination in the generators of g,

H =

cabT aT b +

caT a + c0 ,

T a ∈ g ,

(1.1)

Xa,b

will automatically preserve N . Consequently, if the functions in N satisfy
suitable boundary conditions, one can compute dim N eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues by diagonalizing the ﬁnite matrix which represents H in End N .
Therefore, the classiﬁcation under some well-adapted notion of equivalence of
all ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebras of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators admit-
ting an invariant module of functions (henceforth called QES Lie algebras)
is a good starting point to obtain large families of QES Hamiltonians. In the
one-dimensional scalar case the classiﬁcation is very simple. Indeed, every
ﬁnite-dimensional QES Lie algebra in one real or complex variable is iso-
morphic to a subalgebra of (a central extension of) sl2, [11], [15], [9]. The
classiﬁcation of ﬁnite-dimensional QES Lie algebras in two variables is con-
siderably more involved. There are several inequivalent families of QES Lie
algebras, some of them of arbitrary dimension, and the real and complex
classiﬁcations no longer coincide, [6], [8].

The above classiﬁcation is not, however, the end of the problem. One
still has to determine the conditions under which a quadratic combination
of the form (1.1) is equivalent to a Schr¨odinger operator −∆ + V . In the
one-dimensional case, it turns out that any quadratic combination (1.1) may
be written (locally) in Schr¨odinger form by the combination of a change of

2

the independent variable and a gauge transformation with a non-vanishing
function. The situation in higher dimensions is again more complicated.
Explicit necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the equivalence under local
diﬀeomorphisms and gauge transformations of scalar second-order diﬀeren-
tial operators were ﬁrst found by ´E. Cotton, [2]. As a special case, one
obtains conditions for the equivalence of a second-order diﬀerential operator
to a Schr¨odinger operator acting on a (in general) curved space-time. These
conditions have been solved only in some particular cases, and appear to be
too complicated to be solved in full generality; see [12] for an in-depth study.
This formalism may be extended to deal with matrix-valued diﬀeren-
tial equations, suitable for the description of the dynamics of particles with
nonzero spin, [14], [1], [3], or the treatment of coupled-channel scattering
problems, [18]. The procedure for constructing matrix-valued QES Hamil-
tonians is essentially the same as in the scalar case, with the role of the
Lie algebra g now being played by a Lie superalgebra S of matrix-valued
diﬀerential operators with an invariant subspace of vector-valued functions,
[3].
in practice, however,
the only examples constructed so far with this method are associated to
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie superalgebras, [14], [1], [3]. Lie superalgebras of diﬀer-
ential operators are signiﬁcantly less understood than ordinary Lie algebras.
In fact, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no general classiﬁcation of
ﬁnite-dimensional Lie superalgebras of diﬀerential operators has ever been
attempted. The goal of our paper is precisely that of classifying all QES Lie
superalgebras of 2 × 2 matrix ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators in one com-
plex variable. The Lie superalgebras thus obtained can be readily used to
construct new examples of second-order 2 × 2 matrix-valued QES operators,
by taking quadratic combinations in the generators of S and performing a
suitable change of the independent variable and/or a gauge transformation.
Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the equivalence of a 2 × 2 matrix-
valued diﬀerential operator to a Schr¨odinger operator were obtained in [3]
and [4]. A number of QES Lie superalgebras preserving a two-component
vector-valued module of polynomials in two complex variables were recently
studied in [5].

In principle, S need not be ﬁnite-dimensional;

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize the main re-
sults concerning Lie algebras of ﬁrst-order scalar diﬀerential operators on the
complex line. In Section 3 we outline our classiﬁcation scheme for the ﬁnite-
dimensional Lie superalgebras S of 2×2 matrix-valued ﬁrst-order diﬀerential
operators. We start with a basic result describing the structure of the even

3

and odd subspaces of S. The classiﬁcation of all such Lie superalgebras S is
then shown to be completely equivalent to classifying the ﬁnite-dimensional
graded subalgebras s of the Lie superalgebra d1 of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential op-
erators in one ordinary variable and one Grassmann variable taking values in
the one-generator Grassmann algebra Λ1. In Section 4 we classify all possible
even subalgebras l of d1. The concept of a translation bimodule introduced
in this section turns out to play an essential role in the classiﬁcation, as later
shown in Sections 5 and 6. Section 5 is devoted to the classiﬁcation of the
odd subspaces s1 corresponding to each subalgebra l obtained in Section 4.
We ﬁrst state a necessary condition for l to admit a nonzero odd subspace
s1. The list of the even subalgebras s0 and their corresponding nontrivial
odd subspaces s1 is then presented in Tables 1–4. Finally, in Section 6 the
classiﬁcation is completed by ﬁnding all the Lie superalgebras with nontriv-
ial odd subspace that admit a ﬁnite-dimensional module n ⊂ C∞(Λ1). The
associated ﬁnite-dimensional modules are also classiﬁed, and the results are
summarized in Tables 5–9.

2 Lie algebras of diﬀerential operators.

In this section, we brieﬂy review the basic theory of Lie algebras of ﬁrst-order
scalar diﬀerental operators on the complex line, which will serve as a helpful
guide in what follows.

Let D1 denote the Lie algebra of diﬀerential operators of the form

T = f (z)∂z + g(z) ,

(2.1)

where f and g are analytic functions of a complex variable z, and the Lie
bracket is given by the usual commutator. There are two pseudogroups
of transformations acting naturally on D1 which preserve its Lie algebra
structure, namely local diﬀeomorphisms ¯z = ϕ(z) and gauge transformations
by a non-vanishing function u(z). The action of these transformations on an
operator T is given by

T 7→ T ,

with

T (¯z) = u(z) · T (z) · u(z)−1 .

We shall say that two Lie subalgebras of D1 are equivalent if they can be
mapped into each other by a ﬁxed combination of a local diﬀeomorphism
and a gauge transformation.

4

The Lie algebra D1 splits naturally into the semi-direct product of the

subalgebras of vector ﬁelds V and multiplication operators M:

D1 = V ⋉ M .

The classiﬁcation up to a change of variable of the ﬁnite-dimensional subal-
gebras of V is due to S. Lie, [10]:

Lemma 2.1 Every nonzero ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector ﬁelds on
the line is related by a local change of variable to one of the following Lie
algebras:

h1 = h∂zi ,

h2 = h∂z, z∂zi ,

h3 = h∂z, z∂z, z2∂zi .

Since the natural projection π : D1 → V mapping a diﬀerential operator
(2.1) to its vector ﬁeld part f (z)∂z deﬁnes a Lie algebra homomorphism, and
gauge transformations leave the vector ﬁeld part unaﬀected, one may use
Lie’s classiﬁcation of vector ﬁelds to derive the classiﬁcation of all ﬁnite-di-
mensional subalgebras of D1, [11], [9]:

Theorem 2.2 Let g be a ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebra of D1. Then g is
equivalent to one of the following Lie algebras:

i) g0 = hgi(z)|1 ≤ i ≤ mi, where the functions gi are linearly independent.

ii) g1 = h∂z, zieµz |0 ≤ i ≤ mµ, µ ∈ Mi. Here M denotes a ﬁnite collection

of complex numbers.

iii) g2 = h∂z, z∂z, zi | 0 ≤ i ≤ mi.

ˆg2 = h∂z, z∂z + αi, where α ∈ C.

iv) g3 = h∂z, z∂z, z2∂z + 2αz, 1i, where α ∈ C.

ˆg3 = h∂z, z∂z + α, z2∂z + 2αzi, where α ∈ C.

3 Lie superalgebras of diﬀerential operators

We now focus our attention on 2 × 2 matrix-valued Lie superalgebras of
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators. Let D denote the associative algebra of all

5

2 × 2 matrix diﬀerential operators on a complex variable z. We introduce a
Z2-grading in D in the usual way: an operator

T =

a b
c d(cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

where a, b, c, and d are scalar diﬀerential operators, is said to be even if
b = c = 0, and odd if a = d = 0. This grading, combined with the generalized
Lie product

[A, B]s = AB − (−1)deg A deg BBA ,
endows D with a Lie superalgebra structure. We shall be interested in ﬁ-
nite-dimensional graded subalgebras of the graded subspace D(1) ⊂ D of
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators. Two such graded subalgebras L and L will
be considered equivalent if their elements T ∈ L and T ∈ L are related by a
ﬁxed local change of variable ¯z = ϕ(z) and a gauge transformation consistent
with the grading:

T 7→ T ,

with

T (¯z) = U(z) · T (z) · U(z)−1 ,

(3.1)

where the 2 × 2 invertible complex matrix U(z) is either diagonal or antidi-
agonal. This is a very natural notion of equivalence in the context of QES
problems; indeed, if N is an L-module of vector-valued functions and L is
equivalent to L under the mapping (3.1), then N = U · N is an invariant
module for L. The ﬁrst aim of this paper consists in classifying under the
above equivalence all ﬁnite-dimensional graded subalgebras of D contained
in D(1) .

We begin with the following elementary result, that we shall state without

proof:

Lemma 3.1 Let L ⊂ D(1) be a graded subalgebra of D, and let L0 and L1
denote its even and odd subspaces, respectively. We then have:

i) Either all the elements of L1 are of the form

or all its elements are of the form

where φ, ω, and χ are analytic functions of z.

T1 =

0 φ∂z + ω
χ

0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

˜T1 =

0

χ

(cid:18)

φ∂z + ω 0(cid:19)

,

,

6

(3.2)

(3.3)

ii) If L1 is nonzero, the elements of L0 are of the form:

T0 =

f ∂z + h1
0

(cid:18)

0
f ∂z + h2(cid:19)

,

(3.4)

where f , h1, and h2 are analytic functions of z.

Let us denote by D1 (respectively ˜D1) the graded subalgebra of D generated
by all diﬀerential operators of the form T0 and T1 (respectively T0 and ˜T1)
in (3.4) and (3.2) (respectively (3.4) and (3.3)). The graded subalgebras D1
and ˜D1 are equivalent, since they are related by a gauge transformation with
constant matrix

˜U =

0 1
1 0(cid:19)

.

(cid:18)
Furthermore, the gauge transformations preserving D1 (or ˜D1) are generated
by diagonal matrices U(z) = diag(α, β), where α and β are non-vanishing
analytic functions of z. Therefore, without any loss of generality, we can limit
ourselves to classifying the ﬁnite-dimensional graded subalgebras of D1 under
local diﬀeomorphisms and gauge transformations by diagonal matrices.

There is an alternative formalism for describing Lie superalgebras of dif-
ferential operators which makes use of Grassmann variables. The matrix
classiﬁcation scheme described above is completely equivalent to classifying
all ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebras s of the Lie superalgebra d1 of ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential operators in one ordinary variable z and one Grassmann variable
θ which take values in the one-generator Grassmann algebra Λ1. The even
and odd subspaces of d1 are generated by diﬀerential operators of the form

and

T0 = f (z)∂z + g(z)θ∂θ + h(z) ,

T1 = θφ(z)∂z + χ(z)∂θ + ω(z)θ ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

respectively, where f , g, h, φ, χ, and ω are analytic functions of z. The
appropriate equivalence transformations are in this case changes of the inde-
pendent variables preserving the relation {∂θ, θ} = 1, namely

¯z = ϕ(z) ,

¯θ = β(z)θ ,

(3.7)

7

and gauge transformations with a gauge factor of the form u = α(z), where α
and β are non-vanishing analytic functions of z. The standard identiﬁcations

θ ↔ σ+ ,

∂θ ↔ σ− ,

with σ+ = (σ−)t =

0 1
0 0(cid:19)

(cid:18)

,

lead directly to the equivalence of both formalisms. For the sake of simplicity,
we shall use in what follows the Grassmann variable notation. Our ﬁrst step
will thus be to classify all ﬁnite-dimensional Lie subalgebras l of d1
0, the even
subspace of d1. We will then restrict ourselves to the subalgebras s0 ⊂ d1
0
which admit a nontrivial ﬁnite-dimensional odd subspace s1 satisfying the
conditions

[s0, s1] ⊂ s1 ,

{s1, s1} ⊂ s0 .

(3.8)

We will determine all such odd subspaces s1, and then we will obtain the
ﬁnite-dimensional modules of functions n ⊂ C∞(Λ1) ≃ C∞(C) ⊗ h1, θi asso-
ciated to each Lie superalgebra s = s0 ⊕ s1. Note that the Λ1-valued function
f (z) + g(z)θ is identiﬁed with the two-component function (g(z), f (z))t in
the matrix formalism.

4 Lie algebras of even diﬀerential operators

In this section we classify the ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebras l of the even
subspace d1

0 of d1.

The Lie algebra d1

0 admits the following natural decomposition:

where a is the abelian Lie algebra of all operators of the form

0 = V ⋉ a ,
d1

ˆT0 = g(z)θ∂θ + h(z) .

We ﬁrst observe that the projection π : d1
0 → V mapping an even diﬀerential
operator of the form (3.5) to f ∂z ∈ V is a homomorphism of Lie algebras.
Moreover, both l and its transformed under a change of the odd variable,

¯z = z ,

¯θ = β(z)θ ,

(4.1)

8

and/or a gauge transformation clearly have the same projection in V. There-
fore, π(l) is either zero or equivalent under a change of the even variable

¯z = ϕ(z) ,

¯θ = θ ,

to one of the three Lie algebras hi in Lemma 2.1. The situation in this
respect is completely analogous to the one in the scalar case. Moreover, the
Lie algebra v of all vector ﬁelds of the form

˜T0 = f (z)∂z + g(z)θ∂θ ,

(4.2)

is isomorphic to D1, under the identiﬁcation

˜T0 7→ f (z)∂z + g(z) .

Under this identiﬁcation, a gauge transformation in D1 by a non-vanishing
function u = α(z) becomes a change of the odd variable in v of the form
¯θ = θ/α. Thus, the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebras of D1
in Theorem 2.2 and the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebras of
v under changes of variables (3.7) are identical.

We need to introduce some additional notation at this stage. Let V =
hv1, v2i be an abstract two-dimensional complex vector space. We deﬁne a V -
translation bimodule as a ﬁnite-dimensional h1-invariant subspace of M ⊗ V .
The following result provides a detailed description of V -translation bimod-
ules:

Proposition 4.1 The most general V -translation bimodule is a direct sum

where cµ,1, . . . , cµ,rµ ∈ C, and cµ,1 6= 0. By convention, the indices mµ, nµ,
and rµ take the values −1, −1, and 0, respectively, when their corresponding
modules mi

µ(V ) are zero.

µ(V ) is an abbreviated notation, since the latter

sets actually depend on µ through the parameters mµ, nµ, rµ and cµ,l.
Proof. The only nontrivial point is the structure of the module m3
µ(V ) of
mixed vectors. A mixed vector g v1 + h v2 may always be chosen to be pro-

From now on, we shall use the following conventions. The highest value
imax of an index i labeling a collection of operators S = {Ti | imin ≤ i ≤ imax}
will be set to imin − 1 whenever S = ∅. The letters α, β, γ, δ will denote
complex numbers, while the letter c will be reserved for a nonzero complex
number. We shall also deﬁne the set m0(V ) by

m0(V ) = m(V, {0}) , with c0,k = δk1 c .

Explicitly,

m0(V ) =

zi v1, zj v2, zk(zm v1 + ckzn v2)

separate those generators which characterize a given set from those which
may or may not be present, and

a0 = hθ∂θ, 1i.

10

Theorem 4.2 Let l be a ﬁnite-dimensional subalgebra of d1
alent to one of the following Lie algebras:

0. Then l is equiv-

i) l0 = hgi(z)θ∂θ + hi(z) | 1 ≤ i ≤ mi, where the operators are linearly

independent.

ii) l1 = h∂z ; m(a0, M)i, where m(a0, M) is an a0-translation bimodule.

iii) l2 = h∂z, z∂z + αθ∂θ + β ; m0(a0)i, where m0(a0) is given by (4.5). We

also have the constraint m = n if r ≥ 0.

iv) l3 = h∂z, z∂z + αθ∂θ + β, z2∂z + 2αzθ∂θ + 2βz ; θ∂θ + γ, 1i

Remark. Some of the generators may be simpliﬁed depending on the presence
of the optional generators. For instance, we may take α = β = 0 in l2 if
m, n ≥ 0, or the second generator of l3 may be taken as z∂z + β if θ∂θ + γ is
present.
Proof. Case i) is obvious. Let us start with l1. In view of the isomorphism
a ≃ M ⊗ a0, we have:

l1 = h∂z + gθ∂θ + h, m(a0, M)i ,

where g and h may be eliminated by an appropriate change of the odd
variable (4.1) and a gauge transformation. Consider now l2. Commuting
z∂z + gθ∂θ + h with the elements of m(a0, M) we conclude that M = {0}. If
there are mixed operators present, that is, if r = r0 6= 0 in (4.3), then m = n
and c0,k
j = δkjc. Furthermore, we may eliminate g (respectively h) from z∂z
by a suitable change of the odd variable (respectively gauge transformation)
unless it is a constant. Finally, we may also have a generator z2∂z + gθ∂θ + h.
Commuting it with the generators in m0(a0) we conclude that l3 ∩ a is a
subspace of hθ∂θ + γ, 1i. Since

[∂z, z2∂z + gθ∂θ + h] = 2z∂z + g′θ∂θ + h′ ,

we conclude that g = 2αzθ∂θ and h = 2βz, for α, β ∈ C. Q.E.D.

5 The odd subspaces

We will determine next the possible ﬁnite-dimensional odd subspaces s1 for
each of the families of even Lie algebras li of Theorem 4.2. These odd sub-
spaces must verify the commutation relations (3.8). Let us remark that we

11

are left with very few equivalence transformations preserving the canonical
forms li listed in Theorem 4.2 to simplify the odd subspaces. In spite of this,
we shall see that some of the Lie algebras of Theorem 4.2 admit only trivial
ﬁnite-dimensional odd subspaces.

Lemma 5.1 Let s0 be a subalgebra of d1
0, and assume that s1 is a nontrivial
ﬁnite-dimensional odd subspace for s0. If g(z)θ∂θ + h(z) belongs to s0, then
g(z) must be a constant.

We thus have:

Corollary 5.2 Let s be a ﬁnite-dimensional graded subalgebra of d1 with a
nontrivial odd subspace s1. The even subalgebra s0 of s is then equivalent to
one of the following Lie algebras:

i) s0

0 = hǫθ∂θ +h1(z) ; hl(z)|2 ≤ l ≤ si, where the functions hl are linearly
independent.

ii) s1

0 = h∂z ; ǫθ∂θ + αzs0+1, zleσz | 0 ≤ l ≤ sσ, σ ∈ Σi. Here Σ is a ﬁnite
collection of complex numbers, s0 = −1 if 0 /∈ Σ, and α = 0 if ǫ = 0.

iii) s2

0 = h∂z, z∂z + αθ∂θ + β ; ǫθ∂θ + γ, zl | 0 ≤ l ≤ si.

iv) s3

0 = h∂z, z∂z + αθ∂θ + β, z2∂z + 2αzθ∂θ + 2βz ; ǫθ∂θ + γ, 1i.

The parameter ǫ takes values 0, 1.

In Tables 1–4, we present the possible odd subspaces corresponding to each
family of Lie algebras si
0 in Corollary 5.2. It is convenient at this stage to
introduce the following convention: the parameters ǫ, ˆǫ and ˜ǫ will take the
values 0, 1, and ǫ∗ = 1 − ǫ, ˆǫ∗ = 1 − ˆǫ.

As an illustration of how these tables were constructed, we shall examine
the Lie superalgebras of types 13 and 14 in Table 2. Let T1 ∈ s1 be an
operator of the form (3.6), with φ 6= 0. If χ = 0 for all such operators, then
another operator ˜T1 = ˜χ∂θ + ˜ωθ, with ˜χ 6= 0, must be present in s1. Let us
assume that ǫ = α = 0 in s1
0, and χ 6= 0. Anticommuting T1 with itself we
conclude that φχ is a constant and φχ′ = 0. Thus T1 = θ∂z +c∂θ+ωθ for some
constant c 6= 0. Since [∂z, T1] = ω′θ, we conclude that ω′ ∈ hzieµz | 0 ≤ i ≤
mµ, µ ∈ Mi. Therefore, ω = δzm0+1 for some δ ∈ C. Computing [zleσz, T1]
we conclude that mσ ≥ sσ for 0 6= σ ∈ Σ and m0 ≥ s0 − 1. Conversely, from
{T1, zieµzθ} we deduce that sµ ≥ mµ for 0 6= µ ∈ M and s0 ≥ m0 + 1 (or

12

s0 ≥ m0 if δ = 0). In any case, we can gauge away the term δzm0+1 in T1 and
rescale θ so that c = 1 without aﬀecting s1
0. We obtain the Lie superalgebra
14 in Table 2. The choice χ = 0 in T1 leads to the Case 13.

6 The QES Lie superalgebras

In this section we will determine which of the Lie superalgebras s obtained in
Section 5 (whose odd subspace s1 is nonzero) are QES, i.e. admit a nontrivial
ﬁnite-dimensional module n ⊂ C∞(Λ1), and will classify all such modules.
We start with the following elementary result:

Lemma 6.1 Let s be a ﬁnite-dimensional graded subalgebra of d1 with a non-
trivial odd subspace s1. Then s admits a non-zero ﬁnite-dimensional module
of functions n ⊂ C∞(Λ1) if and only if s0 ∩ a ⊂ a0.

We shall denote the most general h1, θi-translation bimodule by

where cν,1, . . . , cν,tν ∈ C, and cν,1 6= 0. We shall also consider the set

n0 = n({0}) , with c0,k = δk1 c .

In Table 5, we present the list of the even QES subalgebras si

0 in Corol-
lary 5.2. The calculations needed to complete Table 5 present no diﬃculties.
In Tables 6–9, we present the possible odd subspaces s1 corresponding to
the even QES subalgebras in Table 5, along with the invariant modules of

13

functions for s = s0 ⊕ s1. The image of a module n under the action of the
elements of s1 will be denoted by s1[n].

The case 14 in Table 7 perhaps deserves some special attention. According
to Table 5, we have Σ = ∅, {1}. It follows from Table 2 that s1 = hθ∂z +∂θ; θi,
and θ ∈ s1 ⇒ 1 ∈ s1
0. Assume ﬁrst that θ /∈ s1. It is easy to see that pν = qν
in equation (6.1) for ν 6= 0. Remarkably, for ν 6= 0 the parameters cν,l,
l = 1, . . . , tν, deﬁning the mixed functions in n3
ν are no longer arbitrary but
of the form

(qν + l)!
(qν + 1)!
where al are ﬁxed constants that can be determined recursively from the
condition (θ∂z + ∂θ)[n3

Finally, it is easy to see that p0 = q0, q0 + 1 and t0 = 0. If θ ∈ s1, then 1 ∈ s1
0
and the associated module is n1.1, with the constraint pν = qν for all ν ∈ N.
The parameters α and β appearing in the superalgebras of type s3 are
quantized. This phenomenon, the quantization of the cohomology, has been
noticed before in the case of ﬁnite-dimensional QES Lie algebras and has
received some study, [7], [13]. The parameter α is quantized for all ﬁnite-
dimensional Lie superalgebras of the type s3, whereas β is only quantized
in every case after imposing the QES condition. Finally, it is also worth
mentioning that the Lie superalgebra osp(2, 2) ≃ sl(2|1), extensively used in
the construction of QES matrix Hamiltonians (see for instance [14], [1], [3]),
is the QES superalgebra 35 in Tables 4 and 9 with ǫ = 1.

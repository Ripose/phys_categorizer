It is commonly assumed that the long-wavelength limit of a metamaterial can always be 

described  in  terms  of  effective  permeability  and  permittivity  tensors.  This  assumption 

holds true in all metamaterials considered up to now. Here we report that this assumption 

is  false—there  exist  an  entirely  new  class  of  metamaterials  consisting  of  multiple 

interlocking  disconnected  metal  networks,  for  which  the  effective  long-wavelength 

theory  is  local,  but  the  effective  field  is  non-Maxwellian,  and  possesses  much  more 

internal degrees of freedom than effective Maxwellian fields in a homogeneous medium. 

Metamaterials,  which  consist  of  a  periodic  array  of  metallic  or  dielectric  elements, 

exhibit  important  electromagnetic  effects  [1],  especially  in  the  limit  where  the 

wavelength of radiation is much larger than the periodicity. In such limit one generally 

illustrates  the  physics  of  metamaterials  by  constructing  an  equivalent  homogenous 

medium. It is commonly believed that such equivalent homogenous medium can always 

be  described  by  Maxwell  equations  with  an  effective  permittivity  tensor  ε  and 

permeability tensor μ [1,2]. Consequently the corresponding effective field for any meta-

material is Maxwellian. This belief is consistent with the studies of homogenization [2,3] 

since  the  work  of  Maxwell-Garnett  a  hundred  years  ago,  as  well  as  with  all  recent 

researches, which have shown that the effective ε and μ tensors can exhibit a remarkably 

rich  set  of  local  or  nonlocal  behaviors  [4-10],  in  spite  of  several  subtleties  regarding 

homogenization for certain metallic systems [11,12].

In this Letter we report, however, that this assumption is false—there in fact exist an 

entirely  new  class  of  metamaterials  for  which  the  effective  long-wavelength  theory  is 

distinctively  non-Maxwellian.  For  these  structures  the  effective  fields  feature  large 

numbers  of  internal  degrees  of  freedom.  These  new  structures  point  to  previously 

unexplored regimes of optical physics and device applications. Moreover, in connection 

with the modern developments of electronic theory in condensed matter physics, in which 

the  symmetry  of  the  low-energy  (i.e.,  long-wavelength)  excitation  can  be  substantially 

different  from  the  underlying  microscopic  Hamiltonian  [13],  this  work  suggests  that 

similar  developments  can  be  fruitful  in  electromagnetic  theory,  in  which  new  effective 

theory emerges from topological complexity that is commonly occurring in metamaterials.  

To establish our results, we first note that describing the long-wavelength properties 

of a metamaterial in terms of an effective Maxwellian field imposes general constraints 

on its allowed electromagnetic behaviors. For example, if a structure has symmetry of the 

cubic (Oh) or pyritohedral (Th) point group [14], one can rigorously prove that ε and  μ 

must  be  scalar  [15,16].  The  effective  field  supports  either  zero  [17,18]  or  two  [19] 

propagating modes, depending on the sign of the product εμ. The bands are degenerate 

and isotropic, i.e., the iso-frequency surface in k-space is a single sphere. 

Here  we  study  three-dimensional  structures  consisting  of  multiple  interlocking, 

disconnected  metal  networks.  Each  network  by  itself  is  connected  in  full  three 

dimensions. (Fig. 1) These structures all possess a cubic unit cell and either the cubic or 

pyritohedral point group symmetry. Each structure is specifically chosen to highlight at 

least one remarkable feature that cannot be accounted for by a Maxwellian effective field. 

 

2 

In particular, there is no constraint on the number of propagating modes (Fig.1a-c). Also, 

in spite of the structural symmetry, these modes can be either non-degenerate (Fig.1b), or 

anisotropic (Fig. 1c).  

In  order  to  describe  this  new  class  of  metamaterials,  we  construct  a  local  effective 

field  theory  based  on  a  quasi-static  approach  [9,20],  which  is  exact  in  the  long-

wavelength limit. The electro- and magneto-static properties of our  N -network systems 

can be described as  =Q CV  and  =A LI , i.e.,

divided  by  the  area  of  the  surface.  Following  the  concept  of  inductance,  the  magnetic

Both Eqs. (3) and (4) are exact for all frequencies. They are not restricted to the quasi-

 In the quasi-static limit, the dynamic variables  V,  Q,  I, and  A vary at a length scale 

that  is  much  longer  compared  with  the  periodicity.  Thus,  within  each  unit  cell,  Eq.  (1) 

remains valid. Combining this with Eqs. (3) and (4), we arrive at the equation for  V as

In  deriving  Eq.  (5),  there  is  an  important  subtlety  regarding  the  matrices  C and  L. 

The capacitance matrix  C has a zero eigenvalue, since a constant shift in the voltages of 

all  networks  does  not  contribute  to  the  difference  in  charge  distributions  between 

conductors. Also, three of the eigenvalues of the inductance matrix  L is infinite, since a 

constant  current  in  a  fixed  direction  results  in  infinite  vector  potential.  However,  wave 

solutions  have  zero  total  voltage  and  current  in  each  unit  cell,  i.e.,

Thus,  within  the  subspace  of  wave  solutions,  the  inverses  of  matrices  C and  L  are 

appropriately  defined  after  projecting  out  the  eigenvectors  associated  with  the  zero  or 

infinite eigenvalues. The inverses in Eq. (5) are defined in this way. To emphasize this, 

below we refer to 

1−C  and 

1−L  as  S and  U, respectively. The eigenvalues of  S and  U are 

all finite. 

Equation  (5)  describes  the  dynamics  of  an  effective  field  V  that  possesses 

1N −  

independent components, in an effective uniform medium characterized by the matrices 

S and  U. In order to obtain the dispersion relations, one assumes that the voltage varies 

(

(cid:71) (cid:71)
ω− ⋅
t k r

j

(cid:71)
)
. The frequencies of the modes at a given  k

as 

e

 can then be determined by solving 

the  corresponding  matrix  eigenvalue  problem  defined  through  Eq.  (5).    The  matrices  S 

and  U, which describe the electric and magnetic response of the structure, play analogous 

roles  to  the  inverses  of  ε and  μ tensors  in  the  Maxwell  equations.  They  are  constant 

matrices with no wavevector dependency. Hence, we refer to the field theory defined by 

Eq. (5) as local.  

The  components  of  V  represent  the  internal  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  effective 

fields.  They  are  analogous  to  polarization  for  Maxwellian  fields.  However,  unlike 

polarizations,  these  internal  degrees  of  freedom  are  designable  by  geometry,  and  hence 

can exhibit much richer behaviors. 

To highlight the unique electromagnetic properties Eq. (5) describes, we calculate the 

electromagnetic  bands  of  the  structures  shown  in  Fig.  1  using  finite  difference  time 

domain  (FDTD)  methods  as  well,  which  solve  the  underlying  Maxwell  equations  from 

first  principles  without  any  uncontrolled  approximation.  The  computational  domain 

 

5 

corresponds  to  one  cubic  unit  cell  with  Bloch-periodic  boundary  conditions  [19], 

discretized with 48 grid points in each direction. The simulations yield a band structure 

assuming a cubic unit cell. Since the cubic unit cell contains all networks, the results thus 

obtained can be directly compared to the effective field theory. 

Case (1): Two-network crystal. The structure consists of two metallic networks and has a 

point group of a cube (Oh)[Fig. 1(a)]. Each network consists of wires along the edges of a 

cube.  The  two  networks  are  displaced  from  one  another  by  3 / 2a

 along  the  [

]
111  

direction.  With  two  conductors,  the  effective  field  has  only  one  degree  of  freedom  and 
(

the  S  matrix  has  a  simple  form  of

. Therefore, our theory [Eq. (5)] predicts the structure has one 

low-frequency  mode  with  an  isotropic  dispersion  relation,  in  consistency  with  FDTD 

simulations [Fig. 2(a)]. As a further proof of the single-mode nature, we plot the electric 

field  profile  at  a  representative  k-point  in  Fig.  2(b).  The  field  indeed  has  the  full 

symmetry of the lattice. 

The  two-network  system  thus  supports  an  isotropic  scalar  effective  field.  In  using 

optical  waves  for  communication,  polarization  dependency  due  to  the  vector  nature  of 

electromagnetic fields is a major detriment. In connection with the important attempts of 

creating scalar field in one dimension using novel fiber structures [21], our work suggests 

a  route  towards  completely  erasing  polarization  dependency  in  all  three  dimensions.  In 

 

6 

particular,  the  field  profile  in  a  unit  cell  closely  matches  that  of  those  novel  fiber 

structures. 

Case (2): N-network cubic crystal. The structure consists of  N  metallic networks, where 

N  can be arbitrarily large [Fig. 1(b)]. Each network has metal wires along  x,  y, and  z 

directions.  For  the  i-th  network,  these  wires  meet  at (

±

x
i

,

±

x
i

,

±

i

)

 in  each  cubic  unit 

cell. Having 

ix ’s differ more than the thickness of the wires ensures that networks are not 

touching. Such a structure supports 

1N −  low-frequency modes. Since all networks share 

the same fourfold rotational symmetry axes, the constraint 

U

U δ=

ij uv

iu jv
,

 still holds, and 

the band-structure is isotropic, i.e., the iso-frequency surface remains spherical. However, 

due  to  the  large  number  of  the  internal  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  effective  field,  these 

modes  are  in  general  non-degenerate.  The  numerical  simulation  for  the  four-network 

example  in  Fig.  1(b),  with 

ix ’s  chosen  to  be  0,  5 / 24

a

,  9 / 24
a

,  and 

/ 2a

,  indeed 

observes  three  non-degenerate  low-frequency  bands,  in  spite  of  the  cubic  symmetry  of 

the structure. The fields for each of the three modes are strongly localized between two 

adjacent networks. 

In the  N -network structures, since all the low-frequency modes are linear, the density 

of  electromagnetic  states  scales  as 

1N − .  Thus,  the  density  of  state  can  be  greatly 

enhanced  over  very  broad  bandwidth,  possibly  extending  from  microwave  to  infrared, 

which can have important consequences for radiation and spontaneous emission control. 

In contrast, previous attempts to control spontaneous emission involve either broad-band 

suppression  using  photonic  band  gap  [22],  or  narrow-band  enhancement  using 

 

7 

microcavities  [23].  It  is  also  known  that  the  electromagnetic  fields  between  the  metal 

regions  are  strongly  enhanced.  Thus,  with  nonlinear  materials  introduced  between  the 

metal regions, the nonlinear properties of these materials could provide a very interesting 

experimental system of studying the nonlinear properties of  N -component fields, which 

is of considerable interest in modern field theory but until now has largely remained only 

as a theoretical novelty [24]. Finally, the three-network systems, with two low-frequency 

modes, might be designed to function as a transparent electrode that supports deep sub-

wavelength propagating modes. Such electrode is important for light emitting diodes and 

photovoltaics applications. 

Case  (3):  Four-network  FCC  crystal.  The  structure  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(c)  is  a  four-

network structure with a pyritohedral (Th) symmetry. Each network [Inset in Fig. 4(a)] is 

identical  in  shape,  and  is  made  by  translating  x,  y,  and  z-directional  wires  along  the 

edges of a cube by 

ˆb± y, 

ˆb± z, and 

ˆb± x, respectively, where 

b

. These wires are then 

a=

connected by a small cube at each site of a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. The basis 

element  is  topologically  identical  to  Borromean  rings  [25].  This  structure  has  an  FCC 

lattice,  and  possesses  four  threefold  rotational  symmetries  in  diagonal  directions  and 

mirror  symmetries  in  x,  y,  and  z directions.  Based  upon  the  symmetries,  the  S and  U 

matrices become

The  eigenmodes  now  depend  on  the  direction  of  the  k-vector.  The  iso-frequency 

surfaces in the k-space for the three modes are all ellipsoids that are rotated versions of 

one  another,  having  the  major  axis  in  x,  y,  and  z  directions,  respectively  [Fig.  4(b)]. 

These  ellipsoids  intersect  at  the [111]  wavevector  direction  where  all  three  modes  are 

degenerate.  Along  the  [111]  direction  the  field  profiles  of  the  three  modes  are  of  an 

identical shape and rotated versions of one another. 

The  frequencies  of  the  modes  are  determined  by  the  three  parameters

,  and

obtain these parameters by calculating the frequencies of the three modes at a single k-

point  where  the  modes  are  non-degenerate,  e.g.,  (

0, 0, 0.04

aπ .  The  full  dispersion 

)

relation  along  all  directions  is  then  obtained  using  Eq.  (5),  and  compared  to  FDTD 

simulations.  The  excellent  agreements  between  the  theory  and  simulations  [Fig.  4(c)] 

provide a strong validation of our effective field approach.  

The  interlocking  network  topology  here  may  be  amenable  to  fabrication  techniques 

such  as  self-assembly  using  block-copolymers  [26].  While  the  simulation  use  perfect 

 

 

9 

electric  conductor,  it  should  be  reasonable  even  in  the  infrared  region  where  plasmon 

responses are weak. 

The eigenmodes of these structures at a given k-point have zero average electric field 

(cid:71)
on the plane normal to  k

. Therefore, the structures in general have zero coupling with an 

external plane wave normally incident on the structure. Components defined inside such 

structure are therefore inherently immune from  radiation  losses.  Alternative, by placing 

arrays of dipole antennae at the surface of the structure, where the arms of the antennae 

are connected to different networks, the coupling between external plane waves and the 

internal modes can reach 100% [27].

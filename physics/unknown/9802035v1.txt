Abstract

Recursion relation between intensity of hierarchical objects at neighbouring levels of a
hierarchical tree, strength of coupling between them and level distribution of nodes of the
hierarchical tree is proposed. Regular (including Fibonacci), degenerate and irregular trees
are considered. It is shown that the strength of hierarchical coupling is a exponentially,
logarithmically or power law decreasing function of distance from a common ancestor,
respectively.

Keywords: hierarchical trees, ultrametric space, recursion relation

1 Formulation of the problem

Despite widespread occurence of hierarchy in social life and recognizing of its importance to
other systems [1], the theory of hierarchically subordinated ensembles has been mainly evolved
as a necessary part needed to understand dynamics of spin glasses [2], [3]. The key point is that
the hierarchically subordinated objects form ultrametric space. Geometrically, the latter can
be conceived of as a Cayley tree (see Fig.1). Degree of hierarchical coupling between objects,
w, corresponding to the nodes of given level depends on the distance between them deﬁned by
the number of steps m to a common ancestor, so that the ultrametric space is equipped with
metrics, ζ
m (ζ is the distance). The primary goal of this work is to show how the function
w(ζ) can be derived for diﬀerent types of the hierarchical trees.

∝

Let zk be an intensity of a hierarchical object at the level k, assuming that the intensity zk
increases by going from the level k to the nearest higher level k
1 (it looks like climbing the
career ladder). Mathematically, it can be expressed in terms of the simplest recursion relation

−

zk−1 = zk + N −1

k w(zk),

(1)

where Nk is the number of nodes at level k and w(zk) is the required function of hierarchical
coupling. In the case of regular tree, shown in Fig.1a, we have the exponentional dependence

1

of Nk on k which is typical of fractal objects:

Nk = jk,

where j is the branching ratio of tree (the case of j = 2 is shown in Fig.1a). Another example
is the degenerate tree with the only branching node per level (see Fig.1b), so that

Nk = (j

1)k + 1.

−
For the Fibonacci tree (Fig.1c) the number of nodes on k–th level, Nk = F (k +2), is determined
by the Fibonacci numbers F (k), k = 0, 1, ..., that obey the equation F (k + 2) = F (k + 1) + F (k)
with F (1) = F (2) = 1. For k
1.17082,
τ = (√5 + 1)/2
1.61803 is so–called golden mean. As a result, the number of nodes on k–th
≈
level of the Fibonacci tree reads

1 the latter implies that F (k + 2)

≫

Lastly, for the irregular tree like that depicted in Fig.1d a power law approximation can be
suggested:

Nk = nka,

n > 0,

a < 1.

Note that Eq.(1) was originally used for description of resonance hierarchy in nonlinear
oscillations [4] and enjoys the property of self–similarity that is distinguishable feature of hi-
erarchical systems. In order to clarify the point, suppose that zk ∝
1 being the
similarity parameter and w(z) is a homogeneous function, w(ξz) = ξαw(z). Then in the limiting
zk, Eqs.(1), (2) give the conventional relation

w = W zα, substituting expression zk = xkξk = xkj−k/D in Eqs.(1), (2) provides the recursion

the continuum approximation can be used, so that the ﬁnite diﬀerence zk −

where ζ is the distance in ultrametric space and k0 ≫
1 is the number of the hierarchical
level under consideration. Since the main contribution to the integral on the left–hand side of
Eq.(12) is determined by small z we just need to know asymptotical behavior of w(z) at z
0.
According to the above discussion, for small z the function w(z) is homogeneous and can be
taken in the form

(13)

w(z) = W z1−D,

It is not diﬃcult then to solve Eq.(12) for diﬀerent trees with the node numbers Nk deﬁned by
Eqs.(2)–(5) and with Eq.(13) taken into consideration.

2.1 Regular and Fibonacci trees

In the case of regular tree the dependencies of level intensity z(ζ) and strength of hierarchical
coupling w(ζ) on the distance ζ in ultrametric space read

In Eq.(16) and hereafter w(ζ) is assumed to meet the condition w(ζ0) = 1. So, if the distance
ζ to a common ancestor increases the functions z(ζ) and w(ζ) reveal exponential increase with
increments D−1 and ∆, correspondingly. Increment of hierarchical subordination ampliﬁcation
(11) becomes zero for the system with D = 1 (from Eq.(14) the latter means ideal hierarchical
subordination). Both of the decrements D−1 and ∆ increase indeﬁnitely as the fractal dimension
D decreases to zero.

Starting from Eq.(7), it is straightforward to analyse solutions of Eq.(1) and to make a
comparison between the results obtained in the continuum limit and exact ones. Referring to
Fig.2, where the graphs of functions φ(x) and φ−1(x) are depicted, it is seen that if initial value
x0 obeys the condition x0 < xc just a few steps needed for x to approach zero. When x0 = xc,
the solution is deﬁned by Eq.(8) and in the case of x0 > xc solutions increase indeﬁnitely. It
can be shown that in the latter case zk exponentially decays to a constant. At this stage, there
is a good agreement between the qualitative conclusions of the continuum approximation and
exact ones (see Fig.3). It is interesting to note that Eq.(15) can be derived from the exact
solution given by Eq.(9) only if j1/D
ln j/D, that corresponds to the limiting case where
ln j

≪
In order to clarify the above points note that within the framework of the continuum approx-
imation the recursion relation (7) takes the form of well–known Landau–Khalatnikov equation

where the second equation (6) is taken into account. According to Fig.4, potential V (x) in-
creases in region x < xc, where the value xc is given by Eq.(8), and then decreases indeﬁnitely.
It is noteworthy to point the analogy with the theory of creation and growth of new phase
precipitations, where at precritical size of embryos surface tension results in increase of free
energy that then decreases indeﬁnitely due to thermodynamical stimulus of phase transition
[6].

So, one can speak about instability of hierarchical system with respect to increase in the
level number under the initial intensity x0 exceeds the critical value xc. This represents the
well–known fact of the bureaucracy self–reproduction in social hierarchy.

A comparison between Eq.(2) and Eq.(4) shows that for suﬃciently large k the case of
Fibonacci tree (Fig.1c) can be reduced to the above–considered regular tree with j and W
replaced by τ and W/q, respectively. So the fractal dimention D is ﬁxed and equals ln τ / ln 2

When this result is compared with that of Eqs.(15), (16), it is apparent that going from the
regular tree to degenerate one results in logarithmic slowing down of the foregoing exponential
ampliﬁcation of hierarchical subordination.

2.3 Irregular tree

Let us consider the intermediate case of a tree, characterizing by power law growth in level
number (Eq.(5), Fig. 1d). The result can be written as follows:

3 Discussion

The above consideration show both the level intensity z and the strength of hierarchical coupling
w decrease as the level number k increases and, conversely, they are increasing functions of the
distance ζ in ultrametric space. In this connection, it should be emphasized that the dependence
wk characterizes the degree of allience of hierarchical objects at the reference level, whereas w(ζ)
corresponds to the strength of hierarchical subordination.

A distinguishing feature of the regular tree is the fastest rate of change of z(ζ) and w(ζ).
As it is seen from Eq.(10), the number of hierarchically subordinated level is bounded by the
ﬁnite value

κ = (∆ ln j)−1

D[(1

D) ln j]−1 .

(25)

∞

In other words, depth of hierarchical subordination κ is ﬁnite for regular tree, and in this sense it
implies the weak hierarchical coupling. However, for the special case of totalitarian hierarchy,
where the hierarchical coupling is ideal (in Eq.(14) D = 1), depth of the subordination is
inﬁnitely large (κ =
). Nevertheless, according to Eq.(9) intensity of the hierarchical objects
still decays exponentially and the totalitarian system, though being ideally subordinated, is
doomed to ineﬃciency. Social experiments that lend support to this conclusion are well known.
With passage to irregular tree, that is supposed to be of widespread occurrence in nature,
instead of exponentially fast decay inherent to regular tree the hierarchical coupling exhibits a
power law dependence. The slowest, logarithmic law corresponds to degenerate hierarchy with
the only branching nodes per level that can be realized as a selection system. For both irregular
and degenerate trees depth of the hierarchical subordination is inﬁnite, and the hierarchical
coupling of such trees is strong.

It should be emphasized that the above strength of hierarchical coupling is ﬁxed with the
condition w(ζ0) = 1 related to the top level. Since real hierarchical system usually is built up
from top downwards, such choice of normalization is preferred to the condition w(ζ = 0) = 1.
It seems, that given the choice the expressions inside the square brackets in Eqs.(15), (16), (23),
(24) may take negative values at ζ = 0 under the parameter u > 1. But since we are interested
in the supercritical case where z0 > xc and, as is seen from comparison between Eq.(15) and
Eq.(21), u

(xc/z0)D, the condition u < 1 is fulﬁlled.

As is evident from the foregoing, the fractal dimension D, that governs the force of hier-
archical coupling w(z) at given conﬁguration of a tree, plays an important part in the theory.
Throughout this paper, it was adopted that force of hierarchical coupling is characterized by
the only single value of D. It is not diﬃcult to extend the consideration to the case of multi-
fractal coupling. To do this one has to introduce additional parameter q
), so that
the strength wq(z) is distributed over q with density ρ(q) and the fractal dimension D(q) is in
the range between the maximum dimension D−∞ and the minimum one D+∞ [7]. For example,
ρ for ideal hierarchical coupling is given by

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to q and q0 is a solution of equation
D(q) = 1. As a result, the total strength is deﬁned by

w(ζ) =

where Eqs.(16),(22,(24) with D replaced by D(q) can be used as a kernel of Eq.(27). Depen-
dencies D(q) and ρ(q) for a given multifractal can be found after solving the respective problem
(see [7]).

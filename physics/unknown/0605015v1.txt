 Muon ID- Taking Care of Lower Momenta Muons  

C. Milsténe, G. Fisk, A. Para  
FNAL, Batavia, IL 60510, USA 

In the Muon package under study, the tracks are extrapolated using an algorithm which accounts for the magnetic field and the 

ionization (dE/dx). We improved the calculation of the field dependent term to increase the muon detection efficiency at lower 

momenta  using  a  Runge-Kutta  method.  The  muon  identification  and  hadron  separation  in  b-bbar  jets  is  reported  with  the 

improved software. In the same framework, the utilization of the Kalman filter is introduced. The principle of the Kalman filter 

is described in some detail with the propagation matrix, with the Runge-Kutta term included, and the effect on low momenta 

single muons particles is described  

1. 

INTRODUCTION 

Muons in the 3-5 GeV range are

a substantial part of the   produced at 500 GeV center of mass energy, for example 

they constitute ~14% of the muons produced in bbar-b events.  This note describes improvements in the  

identification

at the lower momentum limit. The improvements are made by applying two techniques: first, second order corrections 

to  the  propagation  algorithm  are  introduced  using  the  Runge-Kutta  method,  second,  using  a  Kalman  filter,  multiple 

scattering  and  random  processes  are  added  to  the  propagation.   Multiple  scattering  is  particularly  important  for  low 

momenta tracks, hence of particular interest in the region explored,   The note describes the improvements achieved by 

these methods

THE RUNGE-KUTTA CORRECTION 

The Muon package has been described in detail Ref.[1].  Also, the Muon ID algorithm has been applied to 10000 b-

bbar  Events  [2].   This  note  focuses  mostly  on  the  simulated  muons  of  lower  momenta  which  still  reach  the  muon 

detector (3GeV  p <5GeV) and for which the approximation

MUON-IDENTIFICATION WITH THE IMPROVED METHOD 

3.1. 

The Algorithm   

The  analysis  starts  with  reconstructed  and  well  fitted  tracks  from  the  tracker  with  energy  deposit  in  the  Electro-

Magnetic Calorimeter, EMCal, the Hadron Calorimeter, HDCal and MUDet within a ( , ) angular width around their 

path.  The angular width is optimized for each sub-detector [1],[2]. The Muon Detector trajectories are selected if #hits 

12 in 12 or more layers within the ( , ) width.  For tracks below 10 GeV a (1/p) dependent bin has been chosen. Also, 

tracks which do not leave a signal in the last 5 layers of HDCal are rejected. This last cut takes advantage of the fact 

that most of the hadrons interact well before the end of HDCal and that the hadron showers are short whereas the muons 

have  a  penetrating  power.  Therefore  the  muons,  reach  the  end  of  HDCal  and  leave  hits  in  the  5  last  layers.   An 

additional  cut  requires  the  layers  with  the  minimum  number  of  hits  to  have  1  or  2  hits,  another  characteristic  of 

minimum ionizing particles(MIP). This scans the track for regions of low activity in which MIP pattern can be checked. 

3.2.  Performance of Muon ID 

. The effect of the cuts is shown in Table I. The detection Efficiency is actually better than reported because some of 

the  undetected  tracks  share  hits  between  barrel  and  end-cap  and  will  be  detected  in  a  4  detector.  Also,

the 

normalization  is  to  the  total  number  of  reconstructed-final-fitted  tracks,  whereas  part  of  these  do  not  reach  12  layers 

(see above) and should be subtracted.

The  overall  muon  detection  efficiency  obtained  without  discounting  for  the  effects  described  above  is  ~94%.  This 

covers the entire momentum range. It is ~100% at, and  above, 10 GeV. For muon  momentum at or above 3GeV the 

ALCPG1006 

    detection  efficiency  increased  with  the  Runge-Kutta  correction  from ~30%  to  66%.   A  Kalman  filter  is  used  next  in 
   

order to account for multiple scattering and other random processes and get a better separation of muons from hadrons.

3.3. 

The Principle 

The Kalman Filter is a method used to construct processes for which the information at each step can be fully derived 

from the information at the preceding step and where a covariant matrix of error is available at each step. The Kalman 

Filter  is  composed  of  two  components.   The  propagation  component,  using  the  propagation  matrix,  propagates  the  

information and the error information at each step.   The filtering component combines the information received at the 

end of the step to the information from data measurements.    

     Figure 1: Stepping in the Passive Material (1, 2, 3,4, ) and recording in the Active Material step 5  

The Kalman  Filter operates by using  a  State Vector  that describes the processes  history. For the present case, a 

phase space point is used as the State Vector. The State Vector change includes the effects of dE/dx and of the magnetic 

field in a step by step procedure.   It is calculated using the transport matrix (steps 1, 2, 3, 4 shown in Figure 1) in the 

passive material. The same analytical form is used in the stepper, but is now translated into a transport matrix, with the 

Runge-Kutta term included. The state vector at location k-1 is propagated using the propagation matrix, together with 

the  covariant  matrix,  represented  by  the  cone,  which  provides  the  information  on  random  processes,.  Following  the 

propagation  step,  the  State  Vector  is  updated  using  Kalman  filtering.  The  filtering  combines  the  information  derived 

from the  propagation  with  the  measurement  made  at  the  new point  to  produce  an  optimal  state  vector. It  takes place 

when the hit is recorded in the active material (step 5) as shown in figure 1. The procedure defines, for each radius, a ( , 

) dynamic path in which the hits left by the particle in the active material of the sub-detectors are the data collected.

The  state  vector  at  location  k-1,  is  propagated  using  the  propagation  matrix,  to  location  k.  The  choice  of  the  state 

vector  as  the  phase  space  point  allows  the  use  the  stepper  Algorithm  translated  into  the  propagation  matrix.  In  the 

notation adopted the (-) indicates the extrapolation and the (+) the Kalman weighting.     

The results for single muons at 4GeV before and after the application of the Kalman Filter are shown in Figure 2.

The Results 

ALCPG1006 

 
   
 
    The figure below shows  

5

(track-hit)  between the extrapolated track and the hit at different depths (different layer) 

in the Muon Detector. In the LHS of the figure the width of the distribution is driven by the resolution at 4 GeV and the 

hit collection path covers ~ 3bins in 

. The RHS of the figure shows that one can restrict the hit collection to one bin in 

.

The  Filter  helps  to  master  random  effects  such  as  multiple-scattering  when  particles  lose  sufficient  amount  of 

momentum and  enters the domain  where these effects are dominant. As a result, the Filter allows a better separation 

between muons and neighboring hadrons in jets.

CONCLUSIONS 

The second order corrections and the Kalman filter were implemented in the Muon code to improve the efficiency in 

the low momentum range. The improved analysis includes multiple scattering, the magnetic field effect integrated using 

the Runge-Kutta method and the loss of energy through ionization, dE/dx.   The error at starting point has been chosen 

to be the angle bin size in the calorimeter ECAL. Prior to the entry into ECAL the paths are constructed by the stepper. 

The Kalman filter reconstructs realistic propagation at each step and allows hits to be collected in a narrower kinematic 

band. As a result of applying the Kalman Filter, the cuts around the track path may be restricted to a minimum even for 

low momenta. This was previously possible only at higher momenta. This new capability is particularly important to 

allow for an effective separation of particles in jets.

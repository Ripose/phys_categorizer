          We  studied  the  hard  x-ray  emission  and  the  Kα  x-ray  conversion  efficiency  (ηK) 

produced by 60 fs high contrast frequency doubled Ti: sapphire laser pulse focused on Cu 

foil target.  Cu Kα photon emission obtained with second harmonic laser pulse is more 

intense than the case of fundamental laser pulse. The Cu ηK shows strong dependence on 
laser nonlinearly skewed pulse shape and reaches the maximum value 4x10-4 with 100 fs 

negatively  skewed  pulse.  It  shows  the  electron  spectrum  shaping  contribute  to  the 

increase  of  ηK.  Particle-in-cell  simulations  demonstrates  that  the  application  of  high 

contrast laser pulses will be an effective method to optimize the x-ray emission, via the 

enhanced “vacuum heating” mechanism.

     The  availability  of  intense  femtosecond  laser  pulses  [1]  opens  a  new  laser-solid  interaction 

regime  in  which  intense  laser  pulses  deposits  onto  a  solid  faster  than  the  hydrodynamic 

expansion  of  the  target  surface.  Hot  electrons  generated  via  collective  absorption  mechanisms 

such as resonant absorption (RA) [2] or vacuum heating (VH) [3] penetrate into the solid target 

to produce hard x-rays via K-shell ionization and bremsstrahlung [4]. This kind of intense and 

ultrafast  hard  x-ray  source  has  a  number  of  interesting  applications  for  medical  imaging 

techniques [5] because of its small x-ray emission size, its compactness and the shortness of its 

pulse duration.  

      Control  and  optimization  of  the  hard  x-ray  emission  produced  by  high  intensity  laser-solid 

interaction requests an understanding of several mechanisms: the laser energy absorption, the hot 

electron  generation  and  the  x-ray  conversion.  Several  groups  have  already  reported  x-ray 

emission experiments relying on sub-picosecond laser systems [6-12]. Previous works [6,7] used 

hundreds  of  femtosecond  laser  pulse  produced  by  CO2  or  Nd  laser  systems.  Plasma  density 

gradient steepened by ponderomotive force and satisfy the optimal conditions for RA, which is 

the main heating mechanism at this regime. Recently, it has shown that the use of shorter laser 

pulse  durations  less  than  100  fs  involve  new  x-ray  emission  processes.  Eder  et  al.  reported 

observing a maximum in Kα emission when the target was placed away from best focus [8] and 

qualitatively  explained  with  the  re-absorption  of  produced  photons  inside  the  target.  Based  on 

optimal scale length for RA, Reich et al. [9] theoretically presented a scaling law to estimate the 

optimal laser intensity and predicted a reduction of the hard x-ray yield if the laser intensity is 

higher. Zhidkov et al. [10] studied prepulse effects with a low contrast fundamental 42 fs laser 

due to presence of ASE and showed the presence of a large plasma gradient L/λ=2.5 at modest 

2

 

 

laser intensities laser. They observed a decrease of the laser energy absorption for shorter pulse 

duration with constant laser energy, which was also proved by Schnürer et al. in experiment [11], 

and they reported the critical influence of the plasma gradient for the hard x-ray emission via the 

resonant  process.  All  theses  publications  proved  that  there  is  a  limitation  for  hard  x-ray 

enhancement with laser intensity based on RA when tens of fs, low contrast laser are used.  

        In this letter, we show a breakthrough for this limitation of hard x-ray enhancement in the 

case  of  high  contrast  relativistic  fs  laser  pulse.  Cu  Kα  photon  exhibits  a  higher  flux  when  we 

work with a high contrast laser pulse at 400 nm. Enhanced “Vacuum heating” (eVH) mechanism 

should be stimulated in our experimental condition and in contribute to the enhancement of x-ray 

emission. The yield of x-ray emission can be controlled and optimized via detuning compressor 

gratings  positively  and  negatively.  The  maximum  ηK  can  reach  4x10-4  for  100  fs  negatively 

skewed pulse irradiation. 

      The  experiments  are  realized  with  the  high  intensity  Ti:  Sapphire  laser  system  on  Lab  of 

Optical  Physics,  Institute  of  Physics  of  China  Academy  of  Sciences.  The  laser  delivers  a 

maximum  output  energy  of  >  300  mJ  after  compression  with  a  pulse  duration  of  60  fs.  After 

compression, the prepulse from 8 ns before the main pulse is better than 1x105 monitored using 

fast photodiode. The laser contrast for picosecond pedestal obtained using s high dynamic range 

third-order  femtosecond  auto-correlator  (Sequoia)  is  1x104  (see  Fig.  1a).  A  type  I  potassium 

dideuterium phosphate (KDP) frequency doubling crystal (1 mm thick) is used to get the 400 nm 

second harmonic pulse. The double-frequency conversion efficiency of the KDP crystal is about 

35%  at  200  GW/cm2  intensity.    The  infrared  is  almost  rejected  by  passing  the  beam  over  4 

dielectric  coated  mirrors.  This  increase  a  pulse  contrast  ratio  compared  to  the  picosecond

pedestal > 108 and > 1010 in the ns time window. Finally the p-polarized laser pulse is obliquely 

incident  on  the  target  at  450  by  an  f/3.5  parabola  mirror  in  a  focal  spot  diameter  of  10  µm 

(FWHM)  with  an  average  1x1018  W/cm2  intensity.    By  means  of  a  λ/2-plate  p-  or  s-polarized 

light  could  be  used.  Cu  foil  target  with  thickness  5  µm  was  used  in  experiments.  The 

measurement  of  the  x-ray  spectrum  and  the  determination  of  the  ηK  are  made  with  a  single 

photon counting x-ray LCX-CCD camera [6] placed 1.5 m away from source as a dispersionless 

spectrometer.  An  electron  spectrometer  with  permanent  magnetic  field  B=1000  Gs  is  used  to 

detect electron spectrum [12]. Imaging plate is used as detector in spectrometer and also used for 

electron  angular  distribution  measurement.  The  x-ray  emission  size  is  measured  by  the  knife-

edge imaging technique [6]. The FWHM of fitted Gaussian function shows source size ~10 µm 

in 400 nm laser irradiation, implying no evident plasma expansion in this case.  

      Pulse  duration  is  increased  by  detuning  compressor  grating  but  then  the  uncompensated 

linear or B-integral phase reduces pulse contrast. We were able to vary the laser pulse duration 

from  60  fs  up  to  2  ps  by  changing  the  distance  between  gratings  at  constant  laser  energy. 

Distance  increasing  (decreaseing)  will  cause  incomplete  compensation  of  accumulated  phase 

nonlinearities results in negatively (positively) chirp pulses having a gentle (steep) rise time [13], 

as shown in Fig.  1b.  For a sample pulse, the integrated rising edge energy, normalized by the 

case of 60 fs, are 0.98 and 2.14 for laser with pulse duration 100 fs positively skewed and 100 fs 

negatively skewed respectively. It shows that positively skewed 100 fs pulses are provided with 

almost the same rising edge as the case of 60 fs laser pulse, whereas the negatively skewed one 

has  double  energy  in  rising  edge.  This  is  a  key  factor  for  following  experimental  phenomena. 

The development of preplasma for high contrast laser was calculated using hydrodynamic code

HYADES.  A  double  Gaussian  fit  to  the  temporal  pulse  shape  was  used  and  an  estimate  of 

prevailing plasma scale length (L/λ) before the arrival of the high intensity pulse was obtained. It 

is 0.1, 0.05 and 0.04 correspond to 100 fs negatively skewed, 60 fs and 100 fs positively skewed 

pulse  respectively.  The  effect  of  this  scale  length  difference  was  investigated  as  following 

experiments  and  PIC  simulations.    To  correctly  interpret  the  data,  it  is  crucial  to  establish  the 

proper compressor zero which corresponds to shortest pulse duration.  Group velocity dispersion 

in windows and mirrors affects the pulse duration at the detector as well as auto-correlator itself. 

This results in improperly determination of grating setting for minimum pulse width. The KDP 

crystal  is  used  experimentally  for  this  purpose.  The  energy  conversion  efficiency  for  second 

harmonic pulse is very sensitive to laser pulse duration and undesirable frequency  chirp of the 

fundamental  pulses  at  constant  pulse  energy.  Frequency  chirp  of  the  fundamental  laser  pulses 

reduces  the  KDP  energy  conversion  efficiency.  As  inset  of  figure  2(b)  shown,  KDP  energy 

conversion  efficiency  is  the  maximum  at  the  compressor  grating  position  which  we  defined  as 

compressor zero in experiment. This demonstrates our determination of grating zero is correct. 

      Figure 2(a) represents shows the spectra measured on a Cu target with an x-ray CCD camera 

with  following  parameters:  60  fs,  100  mJ,  1x1018  W/cm2  at  800  nm  (solid  line)  and  400  nm 

(dotted line) wavelength in p-polarized laser. We observe that the Kα yield at 400 nm is higher 

than at 800 nm by a factor of 2. The Cu ηK in 2π steradian reaches ~1x10-4 at this intensity. It 

should  be  noted,  however,  that  the  x-ray  spectrum  is  not  distributed  in  Maxwellian  and  an 

evident energy cutoff (E ~ 20 keV) exist in inset of Figure 2(a), which also predicted in Ref. [10]. 

In  order  to  optimize  Cu ηK,  we  introduce  slight  long  pulse  duration  with  nonlinearly  skewed 

pulse  shape.  Figure  2(b)  represents  Cu  ηK  as  a  function  of  laser  pulse  width  at  negatively 

5

 

 

skewed  (solid  circle)  and  positively  skewed  (solid  square).  It  shows  Cu  ηK  with  negatively 

skewed 100 fs pulse width reach a maximum as 4x10-4 and almost 5 times greater than the case 

of  positively  skewed  pulse.  Inset  shows  KDP  conversion  efficiency  has  no  dependence  as  a 

function of pulse duration with different chirps. However, for S-polarized laser incidence, Cu ηK 

(dotted line) is 3 folds lower and do not show evident pulse chirp dependence.  It simply reduces 

as increasing the laser pulse duration. 

     A higher ηK for a 400 nm laser pulse corresponds to a higher laser energy absorption by hot 

electrons.  According  to  Freshel’s  equations  prediction  and  Price’s  experimental  results  [14], 

inverse bremsstrahlung (IB) decreases for an increasing intensity, whereas in our results the x-ray 

emission  increases  as  a  function  of  the  laser  intensity.  Therefore,  it  implies  that  an  additional 

absorption mechanism is stimulated. If we consider that RA is the main additional mechanism to 

generate  hot  electrons  [2],  a  800  nm  laser  pulse  should  be  more  effective  than  a  400  nm  one  

because  the  later  presents  a  much  weak  pedestal  which  induces  a  smaller  L  (<0.1λ)  that  is  far 

away from optimal scale length for RA[15]. However, our measurement doesn’t agree with this 

assumption. Simulation shows VH dominates RA for steep density gradient [3, 16]. VH means 

that a P-polarized light pulse is obliquely incident on an atomically abrupt metal surface in order 

to be strongly absorbed by pulling electrons into vacuum during an optical cycle, then returning 

to the surface with approximately the quiver velocity [3]. In our laser condition with intensity of 

1x1018 W/cm2, the plasma scale length is 0.05λ according to our hydro-calculation and Ref [17] 

in  similar  conditions.  It  agrees  with  the  necessary  condition  to  stimulate  VH:  Xosc≥  L.  It  also 

satisfies  the  optimal  condition  for  VH:  Vosc/c≥3.1(L/λ)2  [16]  in  which  Vosc=eE/meω  is  the 

electron  quiver  velocity 

in 

the 

laser  field 

that 

is  governed  by 

the  quiver  energy: 

6

 

 

Eq=mc2[(1+2Up/mc2)1/2-1], where Up(eV)=9.3x10-14Iλ2 is the ponderomotive potential. The most 

important  evidence  is  the  cutoff  energy  we  detected,  i.e.  20  keV,  which  rationally  fit  for  the 

scaling  law  of  VH:  Eq=15  keV.  The  x-ray  emission  size  we  measured  confirmed  our  electron 

energy  measurement.  The  x-ray  emission  size  generated  by  400  nm  laser  is  15  ±  5  µm.  This 

value  is  much  smaller  than  in  the  case  of  800  nm  laser  pulse  (  >  80 µm)  [12].    Therefore,  we 

conclude VH is stimulated and may be the main absorption mechanism in our experiment.  

       Hot  electrons  generated  by  intense  laser  field  are  responsible  for  producing  characteristic 

and bremsstrahlung x-ray radiation as they interact with a solid target. Therefore, it is important 

to determine the energy spectrum and angular distributions of fast electrons, which are generated 

by P- and S-polarized laser fields. As figure 3 shown, fast electron emission is concentrated in 

target  normal  and  specular  reflection  direction  in  case  of  S-polarized  laser  incident.  For  P-

polarized laser irradiation, electron emission is much stronger, by a factor 4-5, and show broad 

emission in regime of concerned, excepting a peak along target direction that is presented, in Ref. 

[17], as surface fast electrons when similar high contrast laser incident. Fast electron spectrum 

shows a peaked structure and it is suitable for Cu Kα photon generation, considering Cu K-shell 

ionization  cross  section.  The  spectrum  cannot  be  fitted  by  Maxwellian  distribution  for  a 

temperature  because  the  laser  pulse  is  too  short  to  cause  plasma  satisfied  to  local  thermal 

equilibrium  [12].  It  should  be  noted  that  there is  an  individual  second  peak  with  energy  ~  110 

keV in case of P-polarized laser irradiation, which means another group of quasi monoenergetic 

electron heated by other mechanism and contribute enhancement of fast electron and Kα photon 

generation in this case. Considering enhanced “vacuum heating” mechanism [18] as a candidate, 

which  stimulate  surface  plasma  wave  resonantly  excited  by  laser  and  accelerated  electrons 

7

 

 

perpendicular  to  target  surface,  it  will  accelerate  quasi  monoenergetic  electron,  when 

ponderomotively  heated  electron  phase  match  for  charge  separation  potential,  to  maximum 

energy  Emax  ~  mc2(γosc-1)  ~  120  keV  in  our  experimental  condition,  that  is  almost  same  as 

experimental data.  

Simulations using a 1D fully electromagnetic LPIC++ code have been performed, where an 

electromagnetic wave is launched obliquely from the left-hand side onto an over dense plasma 

located on the right-hand side. We used the following simulation parameters: ne/nc=20, Te=100ev, 

Te/Ti=3~5  and  mass  ratio  mi/Zme=1836.  The  initial  scale  length  is  L/λ=0.05.  A  square-sine 

profile for the incident laser pulse is used. Typically 150x2,680 electrons and ions were used for 

2,680 cells. We consider the initial situation in which the ions are mobile. Figure 4(a) shows the 

temporal dependence of the amplitudes of electric field in the normal direction close to the solid 

surface. It clearly shows a group of electrons is pulled out into vacuum at each optical cycle and 

return  to  target  surface.  The  electric  field  at  the  target  surface,  which  polarity  is  changed 

periodically, reflected this “pull-push” procedure in each laser half period [3, 16]. Electrons will 

absorb laser energy continuously in this way. It demonstrates the VH is greatly stimulated.  

      Figure  4(b)  shows  integrated  electron  energy  absorbed  depend  on  plasma  density  gradient 

(0~1)  at  ∆t=30.  In  the  range  we  concerned,  there  are  3  absorption  peaks  that  locate  at  scale 

length  L/λ=0.1,  0.25  and  0.6  respectively.  According  to  optimal  scale  length,  the  second  peak 

corresponds  to  resonant  absorption  [2].  The  first  one  (L/λ=0.1)  is  result  from  Vacuum  heating 

according  to  Ref.  [16].  The  curve  shows  the  stimulation  of  VH  is  very  critical  depend  as  a 

function of L. This is a key character for VH that contribute to x-ray emission enhancement and 

8

 

 

 

its chirp dependence at high contrast laser irradiation.Experiment and simulation [16, 19] proved 

that,  with  a  slight  surface  expansion  of  the  scale  length,  the  optical  field  would  pull  more 

electrons  into  vacuum  and  thus  be  more  strongly  absorbed,  as  long  as  L  doesn’t  significantly 

exceed Xosc. In our experiments with constant laser energy, pulse pedestal will be expand if we 

tune compressor gratings negatively and match the optimal plasma gradient (L/λ ~ 0.1) for VH 

when  pulse  width  is  100  fs,  resulting  in  enhancement  of  ηK  to  a  maximum.  Positively  skewed 

pulse  with  same  pulse  width  exist  shorter  pedestal  with  smaller  (~40%)  integrated  energy  at 

pulse pedestal according to our measurement, see Figure 1(b). in this case, the stimulation of VH 

is  not  so  strong  compare  to  the  case  of  negatively  skewed.  That  is  the  explanation  for  x-ray 

emission dependence with different laser pulse shape. We need to mention this hard x-ray laser 

pulse  shape  dependence  have  not  observed  in  low  contrast,  800  nm  laser  irradiations.  On  the 

other  hand,  foil  target  show  advantages  for  Kα  photon  enhancement  because  a  strong  electric 

field always exists on the rear side of target, see Figure 4(c). Fast electrons that thrill through the 

foil will been drawn back by this field and return to foil again to produce more Kα photons.  

      In  conclusion,  Cu ηK  produced  by  a  high  contrast  laser  pulse  at  400  nm  with  intensity  I  = 

1x1018  W/cm2  reaches  4x10-4,  thanks  for  restructure  hot  electron  spectrum  shape.  Tuneable 

control  of  hard  x-ray  emission  is  succeed  via  control  pulse  duration  and  nonlinearly  skewed 

pulse  shape.  It  implies  an  effective  method  for  hard  x-ray  enhancement  in  fs-plasma  regime: 

resonant absorption maybe non-effective with femtosecond laser-dense plasma interactions [12], 

whereas  high  contrast  laser  is  more  efficient  for  hard  x-ray  generation  via  enhanced  “vacuum 

heating”.

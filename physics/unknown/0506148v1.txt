that  were  perfectly  symmetric  and  consequently  depth 

1. Introduction 
 
In  a  previous  paper  we  presented  a  double  diffraction  system  intermediated  by  a  slit  to 
achieve 
inverted 
(pseudoscopics)  [1]  [2].  In  this  same  system  we  observed  the  image  with  normal  depth 
(orthoscopic images), in which case the observer looks at a symmetrical diffraction order of 
the second diffraction process [3] [4] [5]. The achieving of an image by means of white light 
using two bi-dimensionally-defined diffractive elements and an intermediary pinhole resulted 
[6] [7] [8]. Because all results were derived of symmetric situations and the enlarging of the 
apertures results in loosing symmetry and extension of the image point to an aberration spot, 
we thought that the intermediary element was fundamental.  Surprisingly, we could find that 
there is an interesting image that results by only using two diffractive elements. Our results 
with two diffraction gratings are formulated in this article while the results employing two bi-
dimensionally  defined  diffracting  elements  are  even  more  interesting  [10].  The  remarkable 
fact is how the spreading of light in open space at the first diffraction can be reversed on the 
second  diffraction  process.  A  rough  comparison  with  similar  refractive  optics  imaging 
processes can be made with the imaging of a white-light object through a small angle prism 
whose  dispersion  is  corrected  by  including  a  compensating  second  prism  on  the  light  path.  
Besides,  because  the  second  diffractive  element  has  almost  total  transparency  for  non-
diffracted  light,  and  therefore  cannot  be  perceived  by  the  observer,  the  image  generates  the 
illusion of a ghost image, therefore, of great attractive appearance.  
 
2. Description 
 
The  process  for  obtaining  white-light  images  for  no  intermediated  double  diffraction  is 
described in Figure 1. The element O is a point of a three-dimensional white-light object. A 
set of luminous rays exiting from it impinges at point x1n the first diffractive grating DG1 of 
2ν lines per millimeter which is at distance z from the object and whose lines are vertical. The 
corresponding diffracted rays reaching the second diffractive grating DG2 a point x2m, when 
diffracted by it, are the double-diffracted rays we consider. DG2 is located at distance Zr from 
DG1,  has  ν  lines  per  millimeter  and  its  lines  are  also  vertical.  The  image  is  seen  by  an 
observer or by a camera whose pupil has a diameter close to an eye’s.  An imaginary set of 
virtual rays that are the virtual prolongation of the double-diffracted rays cross at the image i, 
ib  being  the  image  for  a  short  wavelength  and  ir  for  a  large  wavelength.  To  analyze  the 
capacity  of  the  second  diffraction  element  to  receive  the  rays  diffracted  by  the  first  and  to 
recombine them in an image that is located next to the object we start by the simple equation 
of a diffraction grating. 

First order diffraction at the first grating follows the equation above:

Where  θi  is  the  angle  of  incidence,  θd  is  the  angle  of  diffraction  where  the  light  results 
deviated  for  diffraction,  ν  is  the  spatial  frequency  and  λ  is  the  wavelength,  a  value  that 
comprehend all the visible spectrum. Equation 1 can be expressed in terms of coordinates as:

3. Experimental Setup 

We employed two holographic transmission gratings of the same type, with a constant spatial 
frequency of 540 ± 9 lines/mm for the first grating and 503± 8 lines/mm for the second one. 
The second order of the first diffraction grating and the first order of the second grating were 
employed to correspond with the equations. The effective area employed on each grating was 
approximately  60  mm  x  40  mm.  They  were  located  660  ± 5  mm  apart  in  parallel  position. 
Two  objects  were  tested,  one  was  a  domestic  40  W  filament  lamp  with  its  0,5  mm  wide 
filament vertically located, the second an extended object composed of a metal stamp whose 
surface  was  made  to  diffuse  light  by  painting  with  aluminum  paint  and  of  ordinary  letters 
printed on a cardboard. It was illuminated with a 50 W halogeneous lamp. In both cases they 
were located at the distance of 425 ± 5 mm from the first grating. The observer or the camera 
was  located  at  a  distance  of  468  ± 5  mm  to  the  second  grating  and  its  visual  line  made  an 
angle  of  6.8  degrees  with  the  normal  to  the  gratings.  A  domestic  video  camera  SONY 
Handycam was employed for capturing pictures of the image in a computer. The aperture of 
the lens was 3 mm to keep it comparable to the aperture of a observer's eye. 

 

4. Results and Discussions 

 Our first experiment made the image of the filament lamp to be compared to the image that 
the  system  gives  when  a  1  mm  wide  vertical  slit  is  located  at  the  first  grating  to  select  the 
wavelength bandwidth. Figure 2 shows the photograph of the white-light image at left, and at 
its  right-hand  side  the  image  filtered  to  a  red  bandwidth.  The  images  at  right  correspond  to 
selecting shorter wavelengths sequentially, the two first in the green color and the last to the 
blue  color.  It  is  interesting  to  notice  the  distinct  vertical  dark  fringes  cutting  the  filtered 
images,  because  they  were  caused  by  the  opaque  characters-which  identify  the  voltage  and 
power  of  the  lamp  at  its  glass  bulb,  27  mm  in  front  of  the  filament.    Each  ray  having  a 
different  path  indicates  also  the  perspective  of  a  beam  corresponding  to  the  portion  of  the 
gratings being traversed and the dark horizontal fringes corresponds to the different position 
of the lines of the opaque characters as seen from each different viewpoint. The situation has 

some analogies to a previous case of imaging through a diffraction grating [9], to refraction 
by a prism and to the ordinary process of imaging by a lens. When considering diffraction at a 
grating Figure 3 we notice that the observer sees at each wavelength a different perspective of 
the object because he collects rays that left the object at different angles. We show our system 
in Figure 4 and indicates with two virtual observers VO > and VO < the position from where 
an observer could see a perspective of the object which corresponds to the perspectives being 
collected  by  the  observer.  The  position  of  the  virtual  observers  looking  through  a  grating 
renders a scheme that is analog to the case of a prism, although with wavelength dependence 
inverted. But in those cases the distance at which the object is from the deviating element is 
not  critical,  while  in  our  experience  it  is.  Because  our  system  makes  the  perspectives  to 
converge it can be made an analogy to the action of a lens, where each portion on the aperture 
launches its perspective to be collected precisely in coincidence when the focusing condition 
is achieved. In a similar analogy, the defocusing width on the image for a point or line object 
is  in  both  cases  proportional  to  the  distance  from  the  focused  position  but  in  our  case  it  is 
distinguishable as a spectral sequence of colors, making easier to measure it. If we illuminate 
with  two  or  more  precisely  definite  wavelengths,  as  laser  lines  for  example,  the  defocusing 
can be sharply measured and the object needs not to be a point or a line but can be a border. 
Our second experiment shows the defocusing when the object is focused, 38 mm ahead of the 
focused  position  and  48  mm  behind  the  focused  position  Figure  5.  In  a  black  and  white 
photography the spectral colors cannot be noticed. Our third experiment employed the second 
object described above in order to show the image of an extended object. Figure 6 shows the 
direct  photograph  of  the  object,  Figure  7  shows  its  image  obtained  after  double  diffraction. 
Figure  8  shows  the  image  after  filtering  through  a  common  absorption  blue  filter  because 
some increase in sharpness can be noticed.  

 
5. Conclusions 

It was possible to obtain an image for a process that involves only double diffraction without 
any intermediate element. This new optical system renders images comparable to those of a 
thin  prism  but  with  focusing  properties.  Besides,  it  encodes  depth  in  a  way  that  could  be 
useful for remote metrology.

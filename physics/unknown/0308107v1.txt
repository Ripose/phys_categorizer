1  INTRODUCTION 

 

 

 

 

Engineers,  scientists,  and  other  researchers  have  always  felt  that  it  is  easier  to  conduct 

research than publishing it in journals. Hence, the practice of alternative channels (letter 

writing,  poster  presentation,  demonstration,  informal  meetings,  short  notes  of  work  in 

progress,  conferences,  technical  reports,  pre-prints,  etc.)  for  free  flow  of  scientific 

information.  

1.1 

Non-Peer-Reviewed Pre-Print: 

A  pre-print  is  the  earliest  form  of  publicly  available  research  [1].  Pre-prints  are  pre-

refereed, pre-publication papers. Pre-prints were a good way of establishing priority. In a 

fast moving field as soon as research results are available, it is important to get the work 

into the public domain with a researcher’s name attached to it. Publication in journal was 

usually too slow. Pre-prints on the other hand could be produced quickly and circulated 

immediately by mail to other researchers in order to establish priority. Pre-prints were a 

way of soliciting comments on the research so that the paper could be refined for ‘formal 

publication’. On receipt of comments, a paper would then be redrafted for submission to 

a journal. For the discipline as a whole, pre-prints were a way of reducing the likelihood 

of unnecessary duplication of parallel research.  

3 

However, paper pre-prints were not entirely satisfactory. For a start, they did not halt all 

disputes over priority. Another key problem had to do with distribution. Distribution was 

inevitably  limited.  Only  certain  institutions  received  pre-prints;  others  (including  most 

institutions in underdeveloped countries) were effectively out of the loop. Researchers in 

these places were at a distinct disadvantage.  

1.2 

Non-Peer-Reviewed E-Print: 

The  e-print  (electronic  pre-print)  archives  were  originally  designed  as  a  way  of 

automating  the  paper-based  process  already  in  existence.  E-print  archives  are  globally 

accessible  open  depository  of  non-peer-reviewed  research.  Anyone  with  access  to  a 

networked computer can now look at the pre-print literature. Some have seen the e-print 

archives  as  ‘democratizing’  the  scholarly  communication  process.  Now  the  e-print 

archives services of research output are like newspaper services, with a similar longevity 

[2].   

  

Scholarly publication forms  the  intellectual core  of  any  discipline  [3].  The  provision  of 

free,  open,  discipline-based  access  to  e-print  and  re-print  are  the  responses  of  many 

scholarly  communities  to  the  tactics  of  the  commercial  journal  publishers  who  are 

perceived  to  profit  unreasonably  from  scholarly  work  [4-5].  The  usefulness  will  be 

further  enhanced  by  the  implementation  of  techniques  for  automatically  detecting  the 

occurrence of citations within texts [6], and creating active hyperlinks on that basis [7]. 

Such techniques have been developed in a series of exploratory projects conducted in a 

variety of contexts, including the Open Journal project [8], the Open Citation project [9], 

NEC’s  ResearchIndex  [10],  and  Ex  Libris’  SFX  framework  for  dynamic,  context-

 

4 

sensitive  linking  [11-12].  Interoperability  among  the  various  emerging  “standards”  for 

automated citation-detection and link-creation is one of the primary goals of the Sante Fe 

Convention  [13],  developed  by  the  Open  Archives  Initiative.  The  citation-detection 

process  itself  may  be  made  easier  through  widespread  adoption  of  a  standard  format 

specification such as the Scholarly Link Specification Framework [14].  

1.3 

Non-Peer-Reviewed and Peer-Reviewed Physics Related E-Print Archives: 

James Langer, President, American Physical Society, stated that “We need a system for 

diffusing and archiving scientific information that can grow and change rapidly in size, 

complexity,  and  accessibility.  Both  non-refereed  e-print  archives  and  refereed  journals 

would be essential components of that system.” [15]. 

Physicists check the site every day for new information. They post all their papers there, 

cite references by archives number, use the search engine to find other papers, and need 

little  or  no  other  publication  services.  Publications  on  the  archives  services  are 

instantaneous.  It  costs  the  users  nothing  and  is  self-organizing.  Physicists  all  over  the 

world  can  post  their  research  results  without  being  hassled  by  grumpy  editors  and 

referees. In that sense it is far more democratic. They don’t have to be part of some inner 

circle  of  accepted  colleagues  to  be  on  the  preprint  mailing  lists  and  they  can  find  out 

what’s new on the archives just as soon as everyone else does.  

Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  (LANL),  USA  started  a  multidisciplinary  e-print 

archives  services  in  the  early  1990s.  It  was  a  brainchild  of  Paul  Ginsparg,  [16].  It  is 

 

 

 

5 

currently known as arxiv.org (formerly known as Los Alamos XXX service). It processes 

over 200 new submission per day. 

This  new  system  of  scientific  communication  is  doing  far  more  than  just  providing  an 

ultra-effective  mode  of  operation  for  scientists.  It  is  forcing  a  complete  reevaluation  of 

the  role  of  scholarly  journals  and,  inevitably,  an  equally  thorough  reevaluation  of  the 

roles of those organizations, as their stated mission is the advancement and diffusion of 

the knowledge of physics.  

The current pattern of usage of arXiv looks something like this: 

o  A  researcher  prepares  his/her  work  in  one  of  a  number  of  formats  accepted  on 

arXiv; 

o  The author self-archives by e-mail or FTP or using the submission procedure on 

the Web and the document gets an arXiv document number; 

o  Other researchers are making use of it by finding out from the arXiv web interface 

or through e-mail alerting services; 

o  Comments of other researchers are getting through e-mails; 

o  The  author  then  revises  the  paper  in  response  to  the  comments  and  replaces  the 

original  paper  with  the  revised  one.  The  paper  may  undergo  a  number  of 

iterations; 

 

 

 

 

6 

o  The paper is then submitted to a journal for publication. Some journal publishers 

now  even  allow  submission  in  the  form  of  an  arXiv  document  number.  The 

referees can refer the paper on arXiv; 

o  As per the referee’s comments the paper is either accepted or rejected; 

o  If  rejected,  the  paper  may  be  submitted  to  another  journal  after  any  necessary 

revisions. Revised versions may be included on arXiv; and  

o  The process from journal part repeats. The final and revised version is also placed 

on arXiv. 

Most  preprints  are  issued  with  a  preprint  number  assigned  by  the  author's  host 

institutions.  This  number  identifies  the  paper  within  the  institution  and  distinguishes  it 

from preprints issued by other institutions. The preprint numbers are not standardized, so 

it is difficult to group and sort them in a database.  

The  e-print  number  assigned  by  xxx.lanl.gov  (the  LANL  preprint  server)  provides  a 

standardized common number for preprints that allows the item to be uniquely identified 

regardless  of  the  institution  from  which  it  originated.  The  e-print number  is  also  useful 

for citing the work, as well as serving as a common link between databases consisting of 

bibliographic information and the full text of the article.  

LANL's  alphanumeric  code  provides  broad  subject  categorization,  year  indicator,  and 

accession number. The e-print number is a useful form of identification and serves as a 

linking  point  for  electronic  publications.  The  SLAC  SPIRES  database  and  the 

Astrophysical  Data  System  (ADS)  at  Harvard  use  the  e-print  number  to  link  their 

bibliographic (database) records to the full text electronic versions at LANL. Eventually, 

 

7 

links  could  be  established  using  the  e-print  number  (or  some  other  mutually  agreed 

identifier)  to  track  an  article  throughout  its  publication  process,  from  inception  to  final 

publication, and to reuse the data in future publications [17].  

The format of the e-print archives holdings on the web interface includes many links to 

archives added on the same day, in last five days, different versions of each and every  

e-print archives, etc. 

Studying the service of e-print archives of multidisciplinary nature with a stated mission 

of  the  advancement  and  diffusion  of  the  knowledge  of  physics  is  obviously  interesting. 

This  paper  describes  the  discipline-wise  growth  pattern  and  content  analysis  of  e-print 

archives for physics and related disciplines available online at  arxiv.org. 

2  MATERIALS AND METHODS 

A 

total 

of 

7770 

records 

added 

to 

the 

e-print 

archives 

“http://www.arxiv.org/archives/physics”  on  physics 

related  disciplines 

(including 

mathematics,  non-linear  sciences,  computational  linguistics  and  neuroscience)  during 

1994 to 2002 are considered for the present study. Content analysis has been carried out 

on  the  three  fields:  Subj-class;  Authors;  Journal-ref:  for  the  scientometrics  or 

cybermetrics of archived information. 

3   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

3.1  Growth of Physics Related E-Print Archives:  

8 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 Steady growth in the number of physics e-prints was observed recently. Among the total 

of 7770 e-print archives considered, 75% of them are added during 1999-2002. Research 

discipline-wise  chronological  distribution  of  physics  e-print  archives  are  presented  in 

Table 1. Figure 1 depicts the growth pattern of physics e-prints. The growth pattern of six 

subfields are depicted in Figure 2. All of the subfields have shown a steady and positive 

growth rate except for Chemical Physics. During the period 1996-1997, there is a rapid 

growth  in  the  number  of  e-print  archives  for  ‘Quantum  Physics’  and  ‘High  Energy 

Physics-Phenomenology’.

3.2  Growth of Physics Subfield in E-Print Archives:  

The    field  ‘Subj-class:’  in  the  records  has  been  analysed  for  their  frequency.  Table  2 

shows high frequency physics subfields in the records as per the classification of LANL. 

‘Atomic Physics’, ‘General Physics’, ‘Chemical Physics’, ‘Accelerator Physics’, ‘Optics’ 

‘Biological  Physics’,  and  ‘Computational  Physics’,  are  the  major  subfields  of  physics     

e-print archives. Chronological growth pattern of these seven physics subfields are shown 

in Figure 3. A steep growth can be observed for the subfields ‘Atomic Physics’ ‘General 

9 

Physics’  and  ‘Chemical  Physics’.  A  sudden  growth  also  can  be  seen  for  the  subfield 

‘Accelerator Physics’ from 1999 to 2000.

3.3  Interdomainary Clusters of Physics Related E-Prints:  

The  analysis  of  the  field  ‘Subj-class:’  reveals  that  many  of  the  physics  e-print  archives 

are of intra-disciplinary in nature. Table 3 presents the Interdomainary co-word clusters 

of  subfields  in  the  physics  e-print  archives.  The  intra-disciplinary  areas  of  physics 

‘Classical  Physics-General  Physics’,  ‘Quantum  Physics-Optics’,  ‘High  Energy  Physics-

Atomic Physics’ are of high priority to physicists.

3.4    Prominent Physics Related E-Print Authors:  

Physicists are always one step forward in accepting new technological opportunities and 

challenges. Contributions of individual physicists (Table 4) from India and Australia are 

high. B. G. Sidharth of Centre for Applicable Mathematics & Computer Sciences, B. M. 

Birla Science Centre, Hyderabad  (India) has contributed 57 items to the e-print archives.

Resubmission of Physics Related E-Print to Conference or Journal: 

The  analysis  of  the  ‘Journal-ref:’  field  has  given  an  idea  of  how  many  e-print  archives 

holdings  have  the  information  about  the  source  in  which  these  archives  are  formally 

published. Among the 7770 item studied 2992 (38.51 %) possess the source details. The 

analysis  of  the  sources  reveals  that  physicists  who  are  contributing  to  e-print  archives 

preferentially  publish  their  papers  in  e-Conferences.  Physical  Review  Letters,  Physical 

Review E, Physical Review A, Nuclear Instruments and Methods A, Journal of Chemical 

Physics, Journal of Physics A, etc. are some of the most favourite print and/or electronic 

journals.  

Information dissemination behaviour of scientists must synapse with information seeking 

behaviour  of  target  groups  for  effective  and  efficient  communication  to  occur  [18]. 

Librarians  have  obligatory  role  to  facilitate  pre-publication  activity  in  R&D  institutions 

by  actively  providing  information  inputs  in  the  knowledge  generating  system  for 

accelerating knowledge diffusion and dissemination. Librarians must evolve professional 

management to catalyse  the process of bringing together authors  and their target readers. 

4  PROSPECTIVE CONCERNS 

Electronic  scholarly  publishing,  and  developments  of  the  World  Wide  Web,  are  the 

driving  forces  behind  the  implementation  of  projects  for  archiving,  preservation  and 

provision of access to electronic scientific grey literature [19]. 

E-print archives are powerful and inexpensive solution for sharing scholarly works with 

the world, a concept of “Self-archiving” [22]. The e-print archives services are going to 

run on its own, cost-free and with minimal supervision.  

 

 

11 

Physics is not the only discipline to have pre-print tradition. Almost all disciplines started 

archives  of  their  research  outputs  both  for  peer-reviewing  as  well  as  archival  purpose. 

Hence,  database  creation,  sharing,  linking,  free  exchange,  universal  accessibility, 

timeliness, speed, etc. should be concerns for the archival of global intellectual heritage.  

Logopollution is caused by the production of information that can not reach its potential 

users.  It  is  dangerous  because  it  makes  useful  or  vital  information  unavailable.  Factors 

that  influence  logopollution  include  message  length,  assimilation  time,  message 

efficiency  and  availability,  message  response,  merit,  and  dispersal.  Message  packaging 

should assume new forms in order to reach the right recipient [21]. 

 

5   CONCLUSION 

The  physics  related  interdisciplinary  and  multidisciplinary  scientific  community  have 

conducted  the  most  innovative  and  successful  experiments  in  scholarly  communication 

by the use of the arXiv server.  Researchers use it for disseminating both pre-prints and 

post-refereed  articles.  Interestingly,  they  still  wish  to  have  their  work  accepted  by 

journals, and endorsed by the formal peer-review process, but do not see journals as the 

only means of dissemination and diffusion of  their work. In other words, self-archiving 

is not seen as a substitute for publishing in peer-reviewed journals, but as a mechanism 

for  accelerating the process of peer-review and improving quality of publication before 

submitting  it  to  the  journal.  Past  full  text  e-print  archives,  which  are  not  published 

(61.49%) elsewhere, remains the only source for physicists and may complement further 

research. Present study could reveal some of the current hot areas of interdisciplinary and 

 

12 

interdomainary  interactions.  Many  dynamic  leaders  (researchers,  librarians,  and  R&D 

managers) are beginning to see the potential of e-print archives.

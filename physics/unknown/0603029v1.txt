As shown in a number of our works, the form of histograms – distributions of amplitude fluctuations – 
varies  regularly  in  time,  with  these  variations  being  similar  for  processes  of  any  nature,  from 
biochemical reactions to noise in the gravitational antenna and all types of the radioactive decay [1-5]. In 
particular, we have revealed basic laws, suggesting a cosmo-physical nature of these phenomena, in the 
time  series  created  by  the  noise  generators  of  the  global  GCP  net  [7].  On  the  basis  of  all  the  results 
obtained, a conclusion has been made that the histogram form is determined by fluctuations of the space-
time,  which  depend  on  the  movement  of  the  measured  system  (“laboratory”)  relative  to  the  heavenly 
bodies [8].  

An important step to understand the nature of these phenomena was the finding that at the moments 
of the new Moon, a specific histogram form appears practically simultaneously at different geographical 
points, from Arctic to Antarctic, in middle latitudes of West and East hemispheres [9]. This effect seems 
to be not due to a change of the tide-generating forces; to explain it, nontrivial hypotheses are needed. 

The present paper shows the appearance of specific histogram forms at the culminations of the solar 
eclipses (moments of the geocentric superposition of the Sun and the Moon), with the “eclipse” forms 
differing  from  the  “new-moon”  ones.  Specific  histogram  forms  appear  practically  simultaneously  “all 
over the Earth” and depend nor on the geographical coordinates, nor on the nature of the process studied.  

 
 
1. Introduction 
As  shown  in  our  works,  the  fine  structure  of  sampling  distributions  (the  form  of  the  corresponding 
histograms constructed from the results of the successive measurements of processes of various nature) 
is determined by cosmo-physical factors, i.e. by the position of the measured object relative to the Sun, 
the Moon and the sphere of immobile stars [1-8]. On the new moon, histograms with a characteristic 
form are observed simultaneously at different geographical points [9]. This paper considers analogous 
results, indicating a characteristic histogram form to appear during the solar eclipses.  

In the time series studied, we have not revealed regular changes of the radioactive decay rate 
during solar eclipses. However, we have found that changing regularly at these moments are the forms 
of histograms constructed from those time series. This suggests, among other things, that the analysis 
of  histogram  form  is  a  more  sensitive  indicator  for  various  effects  than  the  analysis  of  time  series 
themselves.  

2. Materials and Methods 
The main method used in this work was a comparison of the histogram form constructed from a small 
number (30-60) of the results of successive measurements. We measured alpha-decay of 239Pu samples, 
which were immobilized on semiconductor detectors in devices designed by I.A. Rubinstein [10]. Such 
measurements,  with  the  number  of  decays  counted  every  second,  have  been  carried  out  in  our 
laboratory  uninterruptedly,  whenever  possible,  for  many  years.  So  now  we  have  data  for  nine  solar 
eclipses, which happened within 2000-2005. 

Another source of data used in this work is time series created by the noise generators of the 

global GCP network. These investigations are given in a special work [7]. 

The  techniques  of  measurements,  histogram  construction  and  analysis  of  the  results  obtained 

are described in papers published earlier [1-6, 10].

3. Results 
The  investigation  of  processes  of  various  nature  through  comparison  of  histograms  allows  one  to 
discover  regularities  that  are  difficult  to  be  revealed  by  traditional  statistic  methods.  The  study  of 
effects  of  the  solar  eclipse  was  no  exception:  here  the  advantages  of  histogram  analysis  were  also 
apparent. To demonstrate this, we shall consider in details the results of measurements of 239Pu alpha-
activity, which were carried out in Pushchino during the solar eclipse of April 8-9, 2005.  

Table 1  and  Fig. 1  show  a  segment  of  a  time  series,  containing  the  results  of  one-second 
measurements obtained during the solar eclipse of April 8-9, 2005. The interval, corresponding to the 
eclipse culmination, is marked with bold red.

Fig. 1. A segment of a time series, representing the results of measurement of 239Pu alpha-activity during the solar 
eclipse of April 9, 2005 at 00:43 by Moscow summer time. Along the X-axis is the time of measurement, sec; 
along the Y-axis is the number of 239Pu decays per second. The eclipse culmination falls in the interval of 31-90 
sec (see Table 1). 
 

Obviously, it is difficult to reveal any regular changes in the rate of radioactive decay during 
the  culmination  of  the  solar  eclipse.  At  the  same  time,  the  histogram  corresponding  to  the  eclipse 
culmination has a particular form.

Some  histograms  constructed  from  these  measurements  are  represented  in  Fig. 2.  Each 
histogram is constructed from the results of 60 one-second measurements, i.e. with the total time of 1 
min. The histograms are smoothed for 11 times by a four-point rectangular window. The order number 
of  a  histogram  corresponds  to  the  number  of  minutes  passed  from  the  beginning  of  measurement. 
Histograms  No. 42,  43  and  44  correspond  to  the  segment  in  Fig. 1.  Corresponding  to  the  eclipse 
culmination  is  histogram  No. 43  emphasized  with  a  bold  frame.  We  will  demonstrate  further  that 
histogram No. 43 has a form specific for the moments of eclipse culminations.  

Fig. 2. A fragment of the computer journal representing a sequence of histograms, each of them constructed from 
60 one-second measurements of 239Pu alpha-activity. The histogram order numbers correspond to the number of 
minutes passing from 00:00 (by Moscow winter time) of April 9, 2005. A bold frame borders one-minute 
histogram No. 43 constructed from the results of measurements during the eclipse culmination. Along the X-axis 
of each histogram is the rate of 239Pu decay; along the Y-axis is the number of measurements corresponding to 
certain rates of decay.  

 
When  histograms  are  constructed  from  30-point  segments,  i.e.  from  measurements  lasted  0.5 
min, the single “anomalous” histogram No. 43 is replaced with two histograms: No. 85 and 86, which 
also have specific form (Fig. 3). These two histograms have mirror symmetry: they are superimposed 
after rotation one of them around vertical axis (Fig. 4).

The  main  thesis  of  our  work  is  the  following.  The  form  specific  for  histogram  No. 43, 
corresponding to the culmination of the solar eclipse of April 9, 2005 (Fig. 2), is also observed at the 
study of other solar eclipses, by using of fluctuations measurements in different processes of various 
nature. This form appears synchronously at different geographical points, independently of the eclipse 
visibility at the place where the measurements are carried out. 

 

Fig. 4. The forms of the two 0.5-min histograms (No. 85 and 86) constructed from the results of measurements 
during the culmination of the eclipse of April 9, 2005 are mirror-symmetric, i.e. similar when superimposed after 
rotation of one of them around its vertical axis.  

 
This thesis is illustrated with a number of charts (Fig. 5-16) which show, in the same way as 
Fig. 2,  sets  of  histograms  corresponding  to  the  culminations  of  solar  eclipses  upon  examination  of 
various  processes,  in  different  years  and  at  different  geographical  locations.  In  these  figures, 
histograms are constructed from the results of measurements of alpha-activity of 239Pu samples (Fig. 5-
7 and Fig. 14-16) or measurements of noise in the generators of the GCP system (Fig. 8-13). In each 
figure, there is a histogram in the center of the second row, corresponding to the culminations of the 
solar eclipse. All figures show that at these culmination points, histograms of the same specific form 
are  observed  at  different  geographical  locations  simultaneously  (with  an  accuracy  of  0.5-1  min)  and 
irrespectively of the nature of the process measured.

Along  with  the  histograms  of  the  “main  eclipse  form”,  other  forms,  less  probable  but  quite 
specific, are also observed near the culmination points of the solar eclipse. Examples of such forms are 
given in Fig. 17-19. Identification of such “transitional” forms is more complicated than identification 
of the “main eclipse form”.

4. Discussion 
As can be seen from the data presented, histograms of a specific form emerge at the culmination of a 
solar eclipse; they are observed in different years and months, appear simultaneously (with an accuracy 
of  0.5-1  min) at different geographical locations and can be revealed upon measuring fluctuations in 
processes  of  various  nature.  The  existence  of  a  specific  histogram  form,  corresponding  to  the 
culmination  of  the  solar  eclipse,  is  an  example  of  the  relation  of  a  cosmo-geophysical  process  to  a 
certain  histogram  form.  As  mentioned  in  the  Introduction,  another  example  of  such  a  relation  is  the 
relation  of  the  moment  when  the  new  moon  comes  to  a  certain  histogram  form,  specific  for  this 
moment [9]. Let us point to characteristic features of the phenomenon described here: 
• 

the histogram form that is specific for the moments of the new moon is clearly different from the 
form specific for the culmination of solar eclipses; 
the time interval, in which specific form emerge, is narrow; 
specific form appear simultaneously at different points of the globe.

It  is  necessary  to  mention  that  reports  on  “anomalous”  phenomena,  which  accompany  solar 
eclipses,  repeatedly  appeared  in  literature.  A  drastic  increase  of  the  neutron  stream  during  the  solar 
eclipse of July 22, 1990 was reported in [11]. The same authors also wrote about spikes in the intensity 
of neutron stream during the phases of the new and full moon [12]. Noteworthy are communication on 
changes of mass measurement of 200 gm standard laboratory weight during solar eclipse of April 8-9, 
2005 made by Vezzoli [13]. Lucatelli reported about decreasing of 60Co radioactive count data rate at

the moment of maximum of solar eclipse of 4 December 2002 [14]. Allais registered anomalies in the 
movements  of  a  Foucault's  pendulum,  taking  place  during  solar  eclipses  [15].  In  Allen  and  Sax’s 
experiments,  significant  variations  in  the  period  of  a  torsion  pendulum  were  observed  both  at  the 
moment of solar eclipse and the moments before and after it [16]. Anomalies, coinciding with the solar 
eclipses of September 23 1987, March 18 1988 and July 22 1990, were observed in the rhythm of an 
atomic clock [17]. Also, some anomalies in gravity measurements were noted at the moments of solar 
eclipses [18].  

All works mentioned above have one point in common: registered there were changes of the 
mean values of measured parameters. In principle, the tide-generating forces can cause such changes. 
In contrast to those works, we do not observe significant changes of mean values at the culminations of 
solar  eclipses.  The  subject  of  our  analysis  is  the  form  of  distribution  of  amplitude  fluctuations  of 
various  processes,  and  this  form  is  almost  insensitive  to  the  changes of mean amplitudes. More than 
once  did  we  search  for  correlations  between  the  phenomena  discussed  and  various  cosmo-physical 
factors [2, 19]. It seems that the specific histogram forms given in the present work are not related to 
the  effect  of  tide-generating  forces:  analyzing  changes  of  the  histogram  form,  we  have  not  found 
periods, which would correspond to these forces. 

The  narrowness  of  the  interval,  during  which  a  specific  form  synchronously  appears  at 
different places, suggests this form to be related to a wave effect accompanying the culmination of the 
solar  eclipse.  Our  previous  studies  indicate  that  histogram  form  would  relate  to  fluctuations  of  the 
space-time  and  hence,  to  the  gravitational  interaction  [8].  To  sum  up,  we  can  suppose  that  the 
characteristic  histogram  forms  described  in  this  work  result  from  a  gravitational-wave  effect,  which 
occurs at the moment of a solar eclipse reaching its culmination.  

The results of our works [20, 21] argue in favor of this supposition. As found in those works, 
the histogram form is sensitive to “regimes with acceleration”, which can be created experimentally, by 
speeding  up  or  slowing  down  a  massive  rotor.  In  works  [22-23],  which  are  in  some  way 
complementary  to  works  [20,  21],  used  a  registration  system  providing  regimes  with  acceleration.  It 
turned  out,  that  such  a  system  is  sensitive  to  culminations  of  solar  eclipses.  The  culmination  of  the 
solar eclipse has a relation to certain extrema in the velocity of change of the space-time position of the 
Sun,  the  Earth  and  the  Moon;  in  this  respect,  the  situation  can  be  considered  as  a  regime  with 
acceleration  and  thus,  it  can  determine  the  form  of  histograms  describing  the  fluctuations  in  various 
processes.

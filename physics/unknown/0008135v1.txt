The RF part of the new high current injector-linac HSI
consists  of  five  cavities  with 
the  new  operating
frequency of 36 MHz instead of 27 MHz of the removed
Wideroe 
calculated  power
requirements of the cavities including beam load in three
structures  were  between  110  kW  for  a  rebuncher  and
1.75 MW pulse-power for the two IH-cavities. The beam
load is up to 150 kW for the RFQ and up to 750 kW for
the two drift tube tanks. An additional 36 MHz debuncher
in  the  transfer  line  to  the  Synchrotron  (SIS)  will  need
120  kW  pulse  power.  We  decided  to  fulfil  these
demands  with  amplifiers  of  only  two  power  classes,
namely  three  amplifiers  with  2  MW  and  six  amplifiers
with 200 kW pulse output power. The latter ones are also
used  as  drivers  for  the  2  MW  stages.  The  200  kW
amplifiers were specified in detail by GSI and ordered in
the  industry.  The  three  2  MW  final  amplifiers  were
designed, constructed and built by GSI. The paper gives
an overview of the complete RF system and the operating
performance of amplitude and phase control with beam
load. It further describes some specialities of the new 2
MW amplifiers like the simplicity of the anode circuit, a
very sophisticated socket for a cathode driven amplifier
with  cathode  on  dc  ground, 
the  parasitic  mode-
suppression,  shielding  and  filtering  of  unallowable  RF-
radiation and operating experience since October 1999.

1  INTRODUCTION

Within the beam intensity upgrade program at GSI[1],
the old Wideroe type injector with four tanks, working at
27 MHz,  was  replaced  in  1999  by  the  high  current
injector  HSI.  During  the  last  year  of  operation,  one  of
the old 27 MHz amplifiers,  originally  built  by  Herfurth
GmbH and redesigned by the Unilac-RF-group in 1984,
was  replaced  by  a  200  kW  amplifier,  manufactured  by
Hüttinger Elektronik GmbH, Freiburg[2]. In this way we
could remove the old amplifier during beam-operation of
the  Unilac  and  gain  a  powerful  plant  for  prototype
activities of the future 2 MW amplifiers, as a connection
to a 24 kV anode supply was available there.

We  changed  the  working  frequency  of  a  second
200 kW Hüttinger amplifier from 27 MHz to 36 MHz to
get a prototype driver. In parallel, five 200 kW amplifiers
where built at Thomcast AG Turgi, three of them with all
the electronics needed for the final 2 MW stages except
the anode supply and the filament transformers[3].

A  prototype  of  the  2  MW  amplifier  was  brought  to
operation  until  the  end  of  December  1998.  After  a
redesign  of  the  prototype  three  final  amplifiers  were
built at GSI in 1999. The first of them delivered RF to
the  RFQ  just  in  time,  the  others  for  the  IH-structures
were ready well before the tanks.

 3  FINAL 2 MW AMPLIFIERS

3.1  Tube Selection

 As the Siemens tube RS2074HF is installed in the five
amplifiers  of  the  Alvarez-section  of  the  Unilac  and
delivers  reliable  1.6  MW  at  108  MHz  with  25%  duty
cycle, we decided to take its low frequency version, the
RS2074SK  for  the  new  2  MW  amplifiers.  This  tube  is
identical  to  the  HF-version,  but  misses  a  lower-lossy-
material  for  the  screen-grid  contact  area,  where  the
pyrolitic graphite grid is mounted to its support.
3.2  Input Circuit

 From  the  old  installations  of  the  Wideroe-RF,  the
1MVA / 24kV anode-power-supply was recuperated, as it
fit all requirements with a few small changes. The reuse
of  the  power-supply,  however,  implicated  that  the
cathodes  of  the  new  amplifiers  had  to  remain  on  dc-
ground. On the other hand, we did not dare to build grid-
driven  amplifiers  with  the  given  higher  frequency  and
power level, but chose a grid1 / grid2 based circuit with
cathode  drive.  The  RF-potential  on 
the  cathode
necessitated to feed the heating-current over two parallel
l /4 strip-lines with a strong capacitive coupling against
each  other.  On  the  RF-cold  ends,  one  of  them  is
connected to ground while the other one is connected to
the heating transformer via a 1200 A filter.

impedance of the tube is transformed to 50 W

2  THE 200 KW AMPLIFIERS

2.1 New amplifiers from Thomcast AG, CH

Most details of the five new 200 kW amplifiers have
been  reported  in  [3].  In  1999  all  five  amplifiers  were
installed at GSI (after the old Wideroe-amplifiers were
removed)  and  brought  to  operation  without  remarkable
problems after introducing additional damping for higher
frequencies through GSI staff in the anode circuits. The
only  massive  breakdowns  occurred  at  the  dc-power-
supplies of the solid state 2 kW drivers, which had been
built  by  a  subcontractor  of  Thomcast.  The  original
power-supplies have all been replaced meanwhile, but the
new ones still have problems and only with the use of a
spare-amplifier we could provide continuos operation.
2.2 Modified old amplifiers

 Two 27 MHz / 200 kW amplifiers built by Hüttinger
Elektronik  GmbH,  Freiburg,  Germany[2]  were  designed
for 10 % duty cycle. As the anode transformers of these
amplifiers  have  75kVA,  there  was  a  very  good  safety
margin to use one of these amplifiers for a buncher at the
end of the new injector that needs up to 30 % duty cycle,
but  only  about  100 kW.  For  this  purpose  we  had  to
change  the  frequency  of  the  amplifier  to  36 MHz. The
-filter  anode  circuit  could  be  easily  brought  to  the
proper  frequency  by  replacing  its  inductance  by  a  strip
transmission  line  and  a  different  tuning  of  the  two
variable  vacuum  capacitors.  The  input  circuit  could  be
tuned without changing any hardware. To suppress self-
oscillations  near 
a
neutralisation  had  to  be  introduced  to  the  amplifier,
which additionally isolated the input from the output by
about  17 dB.  The  second  amplifier  was  changed  to
36  MHz,  too,  and  will  be  used  as  a  driver  for  the  old
2 MW prototype and also as spare unit.

3.3  Tube Socket

 Controlgrid and screengrid are both twice capacitively
blocked  in  the  socket  as  close  as  possible  to  the  rf-
ground  without  any  tunability.  The  capacitors  used  for
this  purpose  were  especially  developed  by  the  Swiss
company  Güller  together  with  GSI.  They  use  a  copper-
silver-plated  polyester  foil  that  is  covered  with  two
silver-plated brass plates, while all isolating foil parts are
covered  with  silicone-rubber.  By  this  treatment  the
capacitors  are  mechanically  robust  and  absolutely
waterproof.  They  were  tested  up  to  8  kV  successfully
without partial discharges.

Figure 5: Parts of the sophisticated socket

When we started operation of the prototype, the output
power was first limited to about 1 MW by excessive G1-
and  G2  current,  caused  by  a  high  level  of  the  third
harmonic  in  the  input  circuit,  as  this  frequency  is  near
the  l /4  resonance  of  the  G1-G2-circuit.  Introducing  a
ring of ferrite between G1 and G2 inside the socket and
changing  the  length  of  the  coaxial  line  to  the  driver
solved the problem and led to the data given in table 1.
3.4  Anode Circuit

 The anode circuit is a l /4 resonator with a shrinked in
house designed and built cylindrical capton capacitor as
anode-dc-blocker, which was tested up to 50kV.

  Strong galvanic output coupling led to the needed low
loaded-Q-value  of  4,  which  means  a  3 dB bandwidth of
about  9  MHz.  This  makes  tuning  of  the  once  adjusted
anode circuit unnecessary, even after a tube change.
3.5  Filtering and Shielding

Unwanted  RF-radiation  of  the  new  amplifiers  was
about 60  dB  lower  than  the  radiation  of  the  old  Unilac
amplifiers, due to an excessive RF-contact-design of all
circuits  (there  are  up  to  7  contacts  in  series)  and  to
sufficient  filtering  of  all  dc-power-lines,  including
especially developed ferrite filled high voltage cables.
3.6  Damping of Parasitic Oscillations

When  pulsing  the  G1  to  lower  values  without  RF-
drive,  the  tube  started  parasitic  oscillations  around
900 MHz.  As  some  tubes,  especially  an  also  tested
RS2074HF,  produced  these  modes  even  with  RF,  we
placed  6  ferrite  rods  around  the  anode  ceramic,  as  this

had  shown  sufficient  damping  for  a  RS2074SK  in  an
earlier  test  which  GSI-staff  did  at  HIMAC.  As  some
RS2074HF still oscillated and as the ferrite kept cold at
full  power,  we  introduced  30  rods  to  each  amplifier.
Now both tube types are usable without oscillations.

 4  OPERATING PERFORMANCE

Six 200 kW and three 2 MW amplifiers were installed
and  brought  to  satisfying  operation  from  January  to
August  1999.  The  implementation  of  a  RF-feedback-
system  was  not  necessary  because  of  the  redesigned
controls[3].  A  hard  to  find  malfunction  of  the  control
occurred at the IH1-amplifier: After some warm-up time
a higher order resonance of the cavity drifted exactly to
the 9th harmonic, which influenced the reference values.
A  low  pass  filter  in  both  reference  lines  solved  this
problem.

5   OUTLOOK

Some  work  will  have  to  be  done  not  to  fire  the
crowbar if a cavity sparks which still leads to an averaged
breakdown of a few minutes per month. We also intend
to test the socket-compatible smaller RS2042SK of the
old Wideroe amplifiers in the rebuilt prototype amplifier
with additional vacuum capacitors. We still have four of
those  tubes  and  they  are  powerful  enough  to  feed  the
RFQ.

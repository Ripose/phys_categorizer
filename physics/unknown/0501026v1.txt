Abstract 

The  bunch-by-bunch  BPM  signal  array  has  to  be  reshaped  into  a  turn-by-turn  (TBT) 

matrix in order to make the TBT beam position information of a single bunch available 

for further data analysis, such as via the Fourier transform to obtain the synchrotron tune 

and betatron tune, etc.  Since the RF frequency sweeps more than 10 MHz in the first 8 

ms of a Booster cycle, the revolution time decreases more than 20%.  The number of data 

points for each Booster turn (BT) should be varied in the same pace with the revolution 

time  since  the  sampling  rate  of  a  digital  oscilloscope  is  usually  fixed.    And  this  can  be 

done  by  pre-determining  the  relationship  between  the  RF  frequency  and  the  time  in  a 

cycle via the curve fit.    

Introduction 

The  BPM  system  in  Booster  can  read  the  average  of  about  15  bunches  due  to  the 

electronic limitation.[1]  However, the BPM detector has a sufficient bandwidth of 3 GHz 

to  resolve  a  single  Booster  bunch.[2]    The  BPM  detector  has  four  striplines  in  a  single 

housing to allow measurements in both planes at one location.  A and B represent signals 

from  the  two  striplines  in  the  plane  of  motion.    In  the  horizontal  plane,  A  and  B  are 

signals from the outside stripline and the inside stripline respectively; and in the vertical 

plane,  they  represent  signals  from  the  top  stripline  and  the  bottom  stripline.    The  beam

position is proportional to (A-B)/(A+B).  In our experiment, a hybrid was used to produce 

output signals  of A-B and A+B from input signals of A and  B in the horizontal long  18 

detector.  A Tektronix TDS 7104 digital oscilloscope with a 1-GHz bandwidth was used 

to  record  signals  of  A-B  and  A+B.    Signals  of  A-B  and  A+B  have  a  bunch-by-bunch 

resolution since they didn’t go through the BPM electronics, which has a bandwidth of 

about 4 MHz.   

In order to reshape signal arrays of A-B and A+B to TBT matrices, the number of 

data points for each BT during the period when the data were taken should be precisely 

known, and they are the same for both A-B and A+B since cable lengths of signals A and 
B are well matched.  Here, the 1st point of the ith turn in the TBT matrix is the same with 
th  point  in  the  signal  array.    Since  the  sampling  rate  of  the  scope  is  a  constant  of 
the  mi
fs=2500 MHz and the Booster harmonic number (h) is 84, once the RF frequency at the ith 

turn (frf(mi)) is known, the revolution period is known from ‘h/frf(mi)’, the number of data 
points in the ith turn (N(mi)) can be calculated using eq.1.

Since the proton beam is accelerated from 400 MeV to 8 GeV in Booster in a time 

of  33.3  ms,  while  the  RF  frequency  sweeps  from  37.8  MHz  to  52.9  MHz.    The  RF 
frequency increases more than 2 MHz during 5 ms to 6.5 ms after the injection.  The 2nd –

order polynomial fit was used to find the relationship between frf(mi) and mi, as shown by 

eq.2, since the relationship between the RF frequency and the time in a Booster cycle is

Experimental Result and Analysis 

Signals A-B and A+B were recorded by a Tektronix TDS 7104 digital oscilloscope during 

the  time  of  5  ms  to  6.6  ms  in  a  MiniBooNE  event  at  the  extracted  beam  intensity  of 

4.0×1012  protons.    Since  the  beam  notch  (BN)  was  created  at  about  4  ms  after  the

injection well before the data were taken for the purpose of reducing the extraction beam 

loss, it could be conveniently used as the indicator of a single BT in the data analysis, as 

shown in Fig.1.  Eight BTs, which are evenly distributed in time along the signal array of 

A-B,  were  chosen  and  their  RF  frequencies  were  calculated  using  eq.1.    The  result  is 

shown  as  the  black  curve  in  Fig.2.    Afterwards,  the  relationship  between  the  RF 

frequency frf(mi) and the point number mi in the signal array was determined by the curve 

fit using eq.2, as shown by the red curve in Fig.2, and the results are A= 42.34987, B1= 

7.0511E-7, and B2= -5.09911E-15.   

The TBT matrix is formed in such a way that each row corresponds to a single BT 

and the row number represents the turn number.  Since the revolution time for a single 

BT got shorter during the time when the data were taken, the corresponding number of 
data points for a row also got smaller.  The number of data points for the 1st turn is used 
to define the 2nd dimension of the TBT matrix, and the rest part of a row is filled by zero 

when the row number is greater than one.  It is important for us to have a final adjustment 

for parameters A, B1 and B2 for the purpose of making each row of the TBT matrix have 

the same starting point relative to the circulating beam.   

As an example, a constant of 4956 was used as the number of data points for each 
row  and  also  the  2nd  dimension  of  the  matrix  to  reshape  the  signal  array  A-B,  and  the 

result is shown as the mountain range (MR) plot, Fig.3(a).  The BN slews within tens of 

BTs  and  is  indicated  by  the  curved  arrow.    Finally,  parameters  A=42.34987,  B1= 

7.0811E-7  and  B2=-7.1E-15  were  used  for  reshaping  signal  arrays  of  A-B  and  A+B  to 

TBT  matrices.    The  result  of  the  TBT,  which  is  obtained  from  the  signal  array  A-B,  is 

shown as the MR plot, Fig.3(b), and each beam bunch is clearly identifiable.   

The bunch position is obtained using eq.4.

Here, i is the turn number, and j is the bunch number in each row of the TBT matrix.     

The 3th bunch from the turn number of i=251 to i=506, which is indicated by the 

double  arrow  in  Fig.4(a),  is  used  to  perform  the  fast  Fourier  transform  (FFT),  and  its 

unnormalized power spectrum is shown in Fig.4(b).  The synchrotron frequency (fsyn) and 

the RF frequency (frf) around 5 ms are about 27 kHz and 42.7 MHz.[3]  The synchrotron 

 

3

tune  (Qs)  is  estimated  using  eq.5,  and  the  result  is  0.053,  which  is  consistent  with  the 

peak #1 in Fig.4(b).

If the peak #2 in Fig.4(b) is indeed caused by the betatron motion, the separation between 

the peak #2 and the peak #3 is equal to the synchrotron tune, which is consistent with the 

chromaticity-sideband  prediction.[4]    Whether  or  not  the  peak  #2  is  caused  by  the 

betatron motion needs to be further confirmed.  For example, one can differentiate this by 

watching the movement of the peak #2 while changing the betatron tune via a different 

quad setup.      

Comment 

The synchrotron tune and betatron tune are clearly identifiable in the unnormalized power 

spectrum of a single-bunch TBT BPM data even when the data were taken at the normal 

operational  condition.    One  expects  that  the  synchrotron  tune,  betatron  tune,  and 

chromaticity  sidebands  would  be  more  pronounced  in  the  condition  when  circulating 

bunches are excited both transversely and longitudinally.

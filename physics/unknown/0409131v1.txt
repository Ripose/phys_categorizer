Abstract.    Breakdown  voltages  of  a  capacitively  coupled  radio  frequency  argon  discharge  at  27 
MHz  are  studied.  We  use  a  one-dimensional  electrostatic  PIC  code  to  investigate  the  effect  of 
changing the secondary emission properties of the electrodes on the breakdown voltage, particularly 
at  low  pd  values.    Simulation  results  are  compared  with  the  available  experimental  results  and  a 
satisfactory agreement is found.  

INTRODUCTION 

It is well known  that understanding of the non-equilibrium processes which occur in 
rf  discharges during breakdown is of interest, both for industrial applications [1-4] and 
for  a  deeper  understanding  of  fundamental  plasma  behavior  [5-7].  In  order  to  optimize 
plasma technological processes it is often necessary to know gas breakdown conditions in 
a discharge device. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to simulate  and measure the 
breakdown curves in rf fields. 

Typically Paschen curves are roughly “u” shaped with a minimum breakdown voltage 
at a specific pd and increasing voltages at both, increasing and decreasing values of pd. 
The breakdown voltage generally forms a fairly smooth curve, with the left hand branch 
of  the  curve  being  markedly  steeper  than  the  right  hand  branch.  But,  under  certain 
circumstances  inflection  points  and  other  changes  in  the  slope  of  the  breakdown  curve 
have been measured [7]. It was found that the left-hand branch is a multivalued function 
of the gas pressure i.e., a single gas pressure corresponds to several breakdown voltages. 
The multivaluedness of the left-hand branch is seen both at small distances between the 
electrodes  and  at  a  large  distances,  while  the  right-hand  branch  has  an  inflection  point, 
but only if the distance between the electrodes is small and the minimum on the curve lies 
at  a  pressure  for  which  the  electron-neutral  collision  rate  is  much  larger  than  the 
frequency of the electric filed. The deviation of the left-hand branch of the curve into the 
high  pressure  region  apparently  occurs  because  of  a  decrease  in  the  ionization  cross-
section.  As  the  voltage  is  increased,  the  emission  from  the  electrodes  increases  and  the 
breakdown curve shifts into the low-pressure region.  

PARTICLE-IN-CELL SIMULATION 

A  one-dimensional  electrostatic  PIC  code,  with  Monte  Carlo  collisions,  to  model  a 
reactor  with  cylindrical  electrodes  is  utilized.  PIC  modeling  techniques  have  been  well 
documented in previous publications [8,9] so only a brief description of the code is given 
here.    The  PIC  method  follows  the  transport  of  a  number  of  superparticles.  Each 

superparticle is composed of a large number of real particles-electrons and ions.  The null 
collisions method [9] is used with isotropic scattering of the particles. Electrons can make 
ionization,  excitation  and  elastic  collisions  and  ions  make  charge  exchange  and  elastic 
scattering  collisions.  Calculations  were  performed  by  using  well  established  cross 
sections for argon [10]. Having in mind that the secondary emission processes are very 
important to determining the breakdown, in our simulations both electron impact and ion 
induced secondary emission processes are included.  

 Electron impact secondary emission 

 
In our simulations we use a Vaughan-based secondary electron production [11,12] that 
includes  energy  and  angular  dependence  as  well  as  a  full  emission  spectrum  including 
reflected  and  scattered  primaries.  This  is  a  more  accurate  model  of  secondary  electron 
production. The electron impact secondary emission may be represented by the secondary 
emission  coefficient  that  is  equal  to  the  flux  of  the  emitted  electrons  normalized  to  the 
initial flux.  It is given by:

Ion induced secondary emission 

 
Electrons released at the cathode travel the whole distance to the anode and produce 
more ionization than electrons created en rote. For this reason, the onset of breakdown is 
determined by g –effects at the cathode. The secondary electron emission from a surface 
under  the  action  of  an  ion  is  described  by  the  coefficient  quantifying  the  number  of 
secondary electrons produced at the cathode per ion usually known as the electron yield 
g  .  Although,  this  coefficient  depends  on  the  cathode  material 
per  ion  and  denoted  by 

i

and the gas it was often assumed that 

g  is constant [13-16].

In  order  to  correct  this  deficiency  first,  we  implement  energy  dependence  of  the 

coefficient

RESULTS OF SIMULATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS 

In order to determine the breakdown voltage, we use the fact that the breakdown 

is not an instantaneous phenomenon, it is occurs over a finite period of time which is 
determined by the balance between creation of charged species by ionization and their 
losses via collisional processes and diffusion to the walls.  In figure 1 we show how 
breakdown voltage depends on the gas pressure. LAM experiment data for argon are 
presented by solid symbols and compared with our simulation results obtained using

CONCLUSIONS 

   At  high  pressure  and  or  large  electrode  separations,  when  the  collision  frequency  is 
greater  than  the  source  frequency,  breakdown  conditions  are  dominated  by  volume 
processes and are relatively independent of surface conditions. At low pressure at small 
electrode separations, the loss rate of electrons to the walls is large so surface effects, in 
particular  electron  induced  secondary  emission,  plays  an  important  role  in  determining 
breakdown. 

On  the  other  hand,  at  high  pressures  where  the  electron  oscillation  amplitude  in  the 
axial direction in sufficiently small compared to the electrode separation, rf breakdown is 
mainly caused by the ionization within the gas. In the case of short electrode distances, 
the  electron  oscillation  amplitude  becomes  comparable  or  larger  than  the  electrode 
separation  and  subsequently  the  secondary  electron  emission  may  take  place  making 
ionization in the gas easier, lowering the breakdown voltage.

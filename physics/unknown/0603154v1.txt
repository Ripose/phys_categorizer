1.  Introduction 

 
The millimeter wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum knew in the last years a rapidly 
growing activity, following the improved accessibility to these wavelengths guaranteed by the 
developments in source and detector technology. A relevant effort was in particular dedicated 
to the realization of the basic passive components of a typical spectroscopic setup, as low-loss 
waveguides [1], polarizers [1, 2], non-reciprocal elements [3], and resonators [4-6]. In the last 
case,  the  solutions  commonly  adopted  at  millimeter  wavelengths  are  borrowed  from  the 
adjacent  spectral  regions,  where  the  technology  of  the  resonant  cavities  is  well  established. 
The main challenge in the development of resonators is the realization of a device combining 
the  performances  of  the  single-mode  cavities,  typically  employed  at  microwaves,  with  the 
versatility  of  the  overmoded  Fabry-Perot  resonators,  mainly  employed  at  far  infrared  and 
higher frequencies. On the other hand, such device should not present the counterpart of the 
above benefits, namely  the mechanical  complexity  of  single-mode  cavities  and  the  extended 
volume of Fabry-Perot, which often represent a limitation for millimeter wave applications.  

It  has  been  recently  demonstrated  that  a  system  of  coupled  waveguides  shows  a  variety  of 
electromagnetic modes trapped at their intersection region [7-17]. Such system can behave as 
a  single-mode  resonator  which  combines  a  very  simplified  spectrum  to  high  performances, 
according  to  the  preliminary  analysis  of  Ref.  [18].  Among  the  proposed  geometries,  the 
intersection  of  a  cylindrical  waveguide  with  a  parallel-plate  waveguide  appears  as  the  most 
appropriate for practical applications, in virtue of its largely open structure and to the presence 
of transverse electric (TE) modes. The trapping of electromagnetic radiation at the intersection 
of the waveguides is in general due to a proper combination of symmetry of the configuration 
and  cutoff  frequency  of  the  modes  propagating  along  the  waveguides.  Such  mechanism  of 
confinement  is  rather  dissimilar  from  that  of  a  close  metallic  box  resonator,  based  on  a 
complete  shielding  of  the  radiation,  as  well  as  from  that  of  the  Fabry-Perot,  explainable  in 
terms  of  a  simple  geometrical  optics  representation.  The  confinement  of  electromagnetic 
radiation at the intersection of coupled waveguides lead therefore to a new conception of open 
resonator, the design and the operation of which requires a dedicated approach.  
The  aim  of  this  article  is  a  systematic  investigation  of  the  properties  of  the  TE011  mode 
trapped  at  the  intersection  between  a  cylindrical  waveguide  and  a  parallel-plate  waveguide. 
Such investigation will be based on the numerical modelling of the essential parameters of the 
mode. It will be in particular determined the mode chart, the quality factor and the power-to-
field conversion efficiency obtainable in the allowed configurations. The mode chart will then 
be  determined  for  practical  working  configurations  in  which  a  dielectric  sample  holder  is 
inserted in the resonator. The obtained results will show that the proposed open single-mode 
resonator  represents  a  favourable  synthesis  of  ease  of  realization,  open  structure,  and  high 
performances, which prefigures its employment in demanding applications.  
 

2. Theoretical and experimental background 
 
The  demonstration  of  the  existence  of  electromagnetic  (e.m.)  modes  trapped  at  the 
intersection region of coupled metallic waveguides represents a relatively recent achievement. 
The first results, based on the TE modes of crossed rectangular waveguides [13-17], have been 
generalized  to  the  hybrid  modes  of  configurations  with  different  waveguides  [18],  and  to 
configurations including dielectric regions [19].    
The  common  aspect  of  such  systems  is  the  existence  of  confined  solutions  with  frequency 
below and above the cutoff of the modes propagating along the waveguides. The basic reason 
that ensures the confinement of the radiation is the availability, at the intersection region, of a 
volume with minimum linear size larger than that available in each individual waveguide [11].

In virtue of the enlarged volume, some electromagnetic modes can exist at frequencies lower 
than the lowest cutoff of the propagating modes. Such isolated modes are necessarily confined 
because,  in  the  limit  of  infinite  waveguides, they  do  not  have  any  channel  to  decay.  On  the 
other  hand,  some  confined  solutions  can  exist  above  the  lowest  cutoff  of  the  crossed 
waveguides.  Such  modes  are  embedded  in  the  continuous  spectrum  of  propagating  modes, 
which  therefore  represent  possible  leakage  channels.  The  additional  mechanism  that  forbids 
the  radiation  leakage  is  in  general  given  by  the  symmetry  of  the  configuration,  which 
introduces selection rules for the coupling of the confined modes to the propagating ones. It 
follows, accordingly, that the symmetry plays a basic role in the definition of the confinement 
properties  of  coupled  waveguides.  On  the  basis  of  its  analysis,  for  instance,  the  minimum 
frequency interval in which a mode with a given symmetry can be trapped is easily predictable 
[18]. 
In the idealized condition of perfect conductors, exact geometry and infinite waveguides, the 
trapped  modes  appear  as  resonances  with  infinite  quality  factor.  In  any  practical  case,  the 
imperfect geometry and the finite conductivity and length of the employed waveguides limit 
the  figure  of  merit  of  the  resonant  device.  Nevertheless,  the  quality  factor  achievable  in  the 
presence  of  the  ohmic  losses  alone  can  be  quite  high,  also  at  millimeter  wavelengths. 
Analogously, the violation of the symmetry due to the geometrical imperfections introduces in 
general  marginal  losses  at  the  level  of  fabrication  tolerances  which  is  typical  of  these 
wavelengths  [18].  The  unloaded  merit  factor 
0Q   of  such  a  resonator  can  be  therefore  quite 
high.  Its  excitation  requires  a  coupling  between  the  electromagnetic  energy  stored  in  the 
intersection  region  and  that  propagating  in  external  guiding  systems.  The  coupling  can  be 
obtained  employing  waveguides  with  finite  length.  Such  operation  introduces,  as  usual,  a 
certain  level  of  irradiation  losses.  However,  being  the  excitation  enhanced  by  the  resonance 
0Q  
effect,  the  coupling  level  necessary  to  reach  a  complete  transfer  of  energy  to  the  high 
resonances can be quite low. As a consequence, the excitation setup is expected to introduce a 
weak perturbation on the field distribution of these modes.  
In one of its simplest form, a coupled-waveguide resonator is realized intersecting a circular 
waveguide  with  a  parallel-plate  waveguide  having  parallel  axis  of  symmetry  [18,  19].  The 
resulting  structure  is  shown  in  Fig.  1,  together  with  a  possible  excitation  configuration  in 
which  the  incoming  radiation  is  coupled  to  the  resonance  mode  through  the  parallel-plate 
waveguide  [19].  Alternatively,  the  excitation  can  be  obtained  by  coupling  the  radiation 
through  the  circular  waveguide,  as  experimentally  verified.  In  both  schemes,  the  resonance 
can be detected by monitoring the reflected signal.  
When  compared  with  the  common  millimeter  wave  resonators,  the  structure  of  Fig.  1 
certainly  shows  a  surprising  topology.  Contrarily  to  the  case  of  close  metallic  cavities,  the 
radiation stored in the intersection region can escape both radially and axially, through large 
apertures  which  minimum  size  is  comparable  with  that  of  the  confinement  region.  The 
proposed  resonator  can  be  seen  as  a  cylindrical  metallic  cavity  in  which  the  plungers  are 
removed  and  the  body  (the  remaining  cylindrical  waveguide)  is  cut  in  two  parts.  It  is  worth 
emphasizing that the cut in the body of the cavity is essential to obtain the trapping of some 
modes,  since  the  simple  cavity  without  plungers  cannot  basically  resonate.  The  additional 
aperture in the open cylinder ensures the confinement of the radiation, instead to introduce a 
further leakage, as suggested by the common sense. On the other hand, such resonator is still 
more  dissimilar  to  the  open  Fabry-Perot  cavity.  In  the  case  of  the  Fabry-Perot,  indeed,  the 
confinement of the radiation is guaranteed by the concavity of the (real or fictitious) mirrors, 
which refocuses the radiation on each reflection on them. Here, the metallic surface is neither 
simply concave nor convex. The profile of such surface - with its sharp edges directed towards 
the  storing  region  -  would  suggest  the  escape  of  the  radiation,  instead  of  its  confinement. 
Nevertheless, it is possible to conclude that, in a sense, the edges help in taking in place the

radiation [9]. The apparent paradox holds only in the geometrical optics representation, which 
is not applicable here due to the closeness between the size of the confinement region and the 
employed wavelength. A correct explanation of the confinement mechanism requires in fact a 
pure wave analysis.  
The  proposed  resonator  cannot  be  classified,  therefore,  in  none  of  the  common  classes  of 
resonant structures. Looking at the possible roots of the proposed device, an evident analogy 
can be established with the nonradiative dielectric resonator discussed in Ref. [19], in the limit 
of unitary permittivity of the dielectric waveguide. The resulting structure can be equally seen 
as a generalization of the open nonradiative cavity proposed in Ref. [20].

The  spectrum  of  the  coupled-waveguide  resonators  is  composed  by  few  resonances 
determined  by  the  geometry  of  the  configuration,  in  which  the  field  distribution  typically 
extends  over  about  a  wavelength  [18].  The  structures  with  rotational  invariance  show  some 
peculiar  characteristics.  They  are  in  general  compatible  with  transverse  electric  (TE)  and 
transverse  magnetic  (TM)  modes  with  null  azimuthal  index  (vanishing  derivative  along  the 
azimuthal  coordinate),  as  demonstrated  in  Appendix  (see  also  Ref.  21).  A  confined  TE011 
mode has been experimentally observed in various open  structures  with such symmetry  [18, 
19,  22].  The  research  presented  in  the  following  will  focus  on  this  mode,  which  is  of 
remarkable importance in practical applications [4, 23-28].  
Fig. 2 shows the typical absorption curve of the TE011 mode, observed in the configuration of 
Fig. 1. In such measurement, the resonator was composed by two square plates of anticorodal 
alloy with 6 mm thickness and 16 mm side, kept at a distance of 1.7 ± 0.05 mm. The diameter 
of the hole representing the circular waveguide was 4.1 ± 0.05 mm, and the distance between 
the hole and the closest lateral edge 1.4 ± 0.05 mm. The curve of Fig. 2 is normalized to the 
incident  power,  by  dividing  the  signal  obtained  with  the  excitation  waveguide  close  to  the 
intersection region to that obtained far from it [19]. Despite the simplicity of the structure, the 
unloaded  merit  factor  of  the  TE011  mode  reaches  the  value  of 
.  The  measured 
0ν =81.44 GHz, can be compared with the theoretical value of 81.6 ± 1.5 
resonance frequency, 
GHz,  calculated  by  means  of  the  finite-element  software  Multiphysics  3.2a  (COMSOL, 
Sweden)  neglecting  the  excitation  setup.  The  uncertainty  in  the  calculated  frequency  is 
determined  by  the  fabrication  tolerances.  The  good  agreement  with  the  measured  value

confirms  the  weak  perturbation  introduced  by  the  excitation  setup.  A  similar  result  follows 
from the numerical analysis of the complete configuration. The electric field distribution of the 
TE011  mode  on  the  axial  cross  section  of  the  cavity  is  shown  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  2.  Such 
distribution is plot only on a quarter of the cross section, in virtue of the azimuthal invariance 
of the mode and of the mirror symmetry of the structure with respect to the median plane of 
the  parallel  plates.  The  condition  of  radial  confinement  of  the  TE011  mode  follows  directly 
from its field structure. As shown in Appendix, indeed, it does not share any field component 
with the cutoff-less transverse electromagnetic modes (TEM) propagating along the parallel-

plate waveguide. Accordingly, the radial leakage vanishes provided that

A  complete  information  on  the  possible  geometry  of  a  resonant  device,  and  on  its  relation 
with the frequency of a specific mode, can be encoded in a single graph, namely in the mode 
chart of the device. The mode chart of the TE011 mode is reported in Fig. 3, in terms of the 
radius  r  of the cylindrical waveguide and of the distance  l  between the parallel plates, both

to  its  asymptotic  value,  the  other  tends  to  zero.  The  field  distribution  becomes  accordingly 
more  and  more  extended  along  one  waveguide,  and  only  marginally  extended  in  the  other. 
Nevertheless, the narrow waveguide is still capable to induce a trapping of the radiation in the 
intersection region. This is true, in principle, for any finite size of such guide, at least in the 
limit  of  perfectly  conducting  walls  [29,  30].  However,  when  the  secondary  guide  is  very 
narrow, the mode is so extended along the main one that it cannot be trapped in structures with 
reasonable  size.  In  the  case  of  Fig.  3,  the  calculation  has  been  stopped  when  the  relative 
difference  between  the  variable  and  its  expected  asymptote  was  lower  than  1%.  The 
confinement level of the mode can also be evaluated comparing its resonance frequency with 
the cutoff frequencies of the intersecting waveguides. The relative value of such frequencies is

According to the mode chart of Fig. 3, the TE011 mode exists for a wide range of geometrical 
conditions. Its practical applicability is strictly related to the figure of merit of the resonance, 
which  is  usually  expressed  in  terms  of  the  unloaded  quality  factor 
0Q   and  of  the  power-to-
field  conversion  efficiency.  The  latter  figure  gives  the  root  mean  square  of  the  electric  or 
magnetic field at a specific point of the resonator, for unitary dissipated power  P . The quality 
factor is important in any application related to the capability of the device to discriminate in 
frequency,  as  in  the  case  of  frequency  filters  [31],  or  when  the  key  parameter  is  the  total 

 

7

amount of energy stored in the resonator, as for the laser sources [32]. The conversion factor is 
important when the figure of merit is related to the amplitude of the field inside the resonator. 
This is the case, for instance, of the absolute sensitivity in electron paramagnetic resonance, 

related  to  the  magnetic  induction  field

obtained, however, for the electric field.

According  to  the  above  analysis,  the  performances  of  the  proposed  open  resonator  are 
competitive with those of a standard close cavity. The axial conversion factor 
zB  reaches its 
maximum  value  near  the  center  of  the  mode  chart,  where  the  energy  of  the  electromagnetic 
field  shows  the  minimum  spatial  spreading.  Close  to  the  asymptotes,  on  the  other  hand,  the 
active volume of the resonator is so large that the energy density goes to zero, as well as  B . 
0Q   shows  a  monotonic  trend  and  its  maximum  value 
On  the  contrary,  the  merit  factor 
corresponds  to  the  minimum  allowed  distance  between  the  parallel  metallic  plates.  This 
property  suggests  that  a  thin  cut  orthogonal  to  a  long  circular  waveguide  can  trap  a  TE011 
mode with high Q value. In this case the electromagnetic energy is widely distributed along 
the  circular  waveguide,  as  shown  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  3.  Nevertheless,  the  ability  of  such 
configuration to discriminate in frequency can be remarkable. A small irregularity in straight 
waveguides can therefore introduce a sharp behaviour close to the cutoff, as anticipated.

5. Loaded resonator 
 
In the common spectroscopic applications, it is necessary to introduce a sample in the cavity 
and  very  often  also  a  sample  holder.  In  view  of  a  general  use  of  the  coupled-waveguide 
resonator, it is therefore mandatory to evaluate the effects of a low-loss sample holder on its 
mode  chart.  Two  illustrative  cases  have  been  considered:  in  the  first  one,  the  cylindrical 
waveguide is filled with a dielectric tube made of teflon (dielectric permittivity ε = 2.05); in 
the second one, a teflon slab is introduced between the metallic plates. Both configurations can 
be easily realized, in virtue of the open structure of the resonator. The resulting mode charts of 
the  TE011  mode  are  reported  in  Fig.  5.  The  limit  conditions  for  such  configurations  can  be 
predicted  following  the  same  approach  employed  for  the  analysis  of  the  empty  resonator, 
taking now into account the effective optical size due to the dielectric material. In the case of 
cylindrical  waveguide  filled  with  a  medium  with  permittivity  ε,  the  asymptotes  become

confirmed by the modelling. Similar results have been obtained for other representative cases 
covering  a  large  interval  of  dielectric  permittivity.  Accordingly,  the  TE011  resonance  is  in 
general  stable  with  respect  to  the  insertion  of  a  dielectric  material  along  the  intersecting 
waveguides.  
From a practical point of view, another basic issue is the tuning of the resonance frequency. 
In the proposed resonator it can be implemented, for instance, varying the distance  l  between 
the parallel plates. The dependence of the resonance frequency on  l  for a given radius  r  can 
be extracted from the mode chart of Fig. 3.

In  conclusion,  the  resonator  obtained  coupling  a  circular  waveguide  to  a  parallel-plate 
waveguide  shows  different  peculiarities.  It  combines  a  largely  open  structure  to  a  reduced 
active volume, properties that represent the basis of its simplified spectrum of trapped modes. 
Among such modes, the TE011 one ensures high performances and a weak dependence on the 
perturbation of the symmetry, without structural degeneracy with other confined modes. It is 
moreover  stable  with  respect  to  the  insertion  of  a  sample  holder  along  both  the  component 
waveguides.  The  capability  of  coupled  waveguides  to  trap  electromagnetic  modes  at  their 
intersection region enables, therefore, the realization of a simple and robust resonant device.  
 
 

Appendix 
 
The  vector  properties  of  the  electromagnetic  modes  of  a  generic  system  with  rotational 

invariance are considered first, assuming the azimuthal invariance (

≡

0

) of the solution. A 

∂
∂
ϕ

system  with  no  source  terms  (free  charges  and  currents)  and  media  with  finite  conductivity 
will  be  assumed.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  conductivity  can  be  included  in  the  complex 
permittivity. 
In  a  linear  and  local  medium  with  rotational  invariance  about  the  z-direction,  the  most 
general  expressions  for  the  tensor  of  the  dielectric  permittivity  and  for  that  of  the  magnetic 
permeability are

In any homogeneous region of this medium, the Maxwell equations can be written in terms

In  the  case  of  solutions  with  azimuthal  invariance,  the  above  equations  decouple  in  two 
zH )  and  the  second  one  the 
groups,  the  first  one  involving  the  field  components  ( Hρ ,  Eϕ, 
components  ( Eρ,  Hϕ, 
zE ).  The  former  admits  therefore  TE0  solutions  and  the  latter  TM0 
solutions, which can be in both cases bounded or unbounded. The subscript ‘0’ indicates the 
azimuthal invariance of the solution. Such two complete sets of modes do not share any field 
component. However, they can be mixed by the boundary conditions.  
Consider  now  the  boundary  between  two  different  regions  labeled  with  1  and  2,  and  the 
normal  to  the  separating  surface,  labeled  with  ˆn .  In  the  above  assumptions,  the  boundary 

conditions reduce to continuity equations of the form

conditions  impose  therefore  the  continuity  of  the  term

and  Hϕ,  and  of  the  terms 
conditions  can  be  separated  in  two  sets  of  equations  involving  the  above  field  components. 
Since  these  conditions  do  not  mix  the  TE0  and  TM0  partial  solutions  obtained  in  each 
homogenous region, the complete solutions resulting for the whole domain will show the same 
TE0 or TM0 character. The generalization of this result to systems with a continuous variation 
of  permittivity  and  permeability  can  be  obtained  by  approximating  these  quantities  with 
stepwise  functions,  and  then  taking  the  limit.  A  limit  operation  on  the  conductivity  of  the 
employed materials can be employed as well to extend the above property to configurations 
including ideal conductors.  
A similar approach can be followed to demonstrate that the modes with azimuthal and axial

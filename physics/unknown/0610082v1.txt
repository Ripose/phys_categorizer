Abstract: The new proposed “energy gradient theory,” which physically explains the phenomena 

of  flow  instability  and  turbulent  transition  in  shear  flows  and  has  been  shown  to  be  valid  for 

parallel flows, is extended to curved flows in this study. Then, three important theorems for fluid 

dynamics are deduced. These theorems are (1) Potential flow (inviscid and 

×∇ V

0=

) is stable.  

(2)  Inviscid  rotational  (

×∇ V

0≠

)  flow  is  unstable.  (3)  Velocity  profile  with  an  inflectional 

point  is  unstable  when  there  is  no  work  input  or  output  to  the  system,  for  both  inviscid  and 

viscous flows. These theorems are, for the first time, deduced, and are of great significance for 

the understanding of generation of turbulence and the explanation of complex flows. From these 

results,  it  is  concluded  that  the  classical  Rayleigh  theorem  (1880)  on  inflectional  velocity 

instability of inviscid flows is incorrect which has last for more than a century. It is demonstrated 

that existence of inflection point on velocity profile is a sufficient condition, but not a necessary 

condition for flow instability, for both inviscid and viscous flows.

1. Introduction 

 

The  classical  linear  stability  theory  which  is  back  to  Rayleigh  (1880)  has  been  well 

established in the literature and in the most text books [1-6]. However, for the onset of instability, 

this  theory  obtains  agreement  with  experiments  only  for  few  flows  cases  (Rayleigh-Bernard 

problem  and  Taylor-Couette  problem),  and  disagrees  with  most  other  flow  cases  (pipe  flow, 

channel flow, Couette flow, and boundary layer flow). For Poiseuille flow in a straight pipe and 

plane  Couette  flow,  linear  stability  analysis  shows  that  they  are  stable  for  all  the  range  of 

Reynolds number while they both transit to turbulence at finite Reynolds number in experiments 

[1-5].  These  phenomena  are  still  not  clarified  so  far.  In  order  to  interpreter  these  discrepancies

with  the  experiments,  people  even  used  different  explanations  for  different  flows  [2].  For 

example,  dual  roles  of  viscosity  was  assumed  in  order  to  explain  the  turbulent  generation  in 

boundary  layers  [2,7]  to  merge  the  disagreement  of  the  theory  with  experiments.  The  flow 

instabilities  are  artificially  divided  into  viscous  instability  and  inviscid  instability  [2,3].  Even  if 

these assumptions are made, there are still many flow phenomena could not be well understood.  

Energy  method  based  on  Reynolds-Orr  equation  searches  for  the  minimum  Reynolds 

number of the disturbance energy monotonically decrease with the time in the system [1-3,8]. The 

predicted critical Reynolds number is much lower than that from experiments for parallel flows 

[2-3].  On  the  other  hand,  the  occurrence  of  stability  is  strictly  a  local  behaviour  and  the  flow 

during  the  transition  is  intermittent.  The  first  occurrence  of  the  flow  instability  generally  takes 

place in the most “dangerous” positions as seen in the formation of turbulence spot, the cylinder 

wake, and the dynamic stall on the airfoil with large attack angle. Hence, a method considering 

the local flow behaviour may be the correct approach.   

The  weekly  nonlinear  method  which  has  been  developed  for  a  half  century  [9]  and  the 

secondary instability theory which was developed in 1980’s [10] seem to give better results than 

the  above-mentioned  methods  and  can  explain  some  phenomena;  however  there  is  still 

discrepancy with experiments.  

In a recent study, Dou developed an “Energy Gradient Theory” by rigorous derivation, in 

which  the  detail  of  amplification  or  decay  of  the  disturbance  has  been  described  [11-13].  The 

theory  proposes  that  in  shear  flows  it  is  the  transverse  energy  gradient  interacting  with  a 

disturbance to lead to the flow instability, while the energy loss, due to viscous friction along the 

streamline, damps the disturbance. The mechanisms of velocity inflection and formation and lift 

of the hairpin vortex are well explained with the analytical result; the disturbed particle exchanges 

energy with other particles in transverse direction during the cycle and causes the particle leaves 

its  equilibrium  position.  The  threshold  amplitude  of  disturbance  for  transition  to  turbulence  is 

scaled  with  Re  by  an  exponent  of 

1−=γ

in  parallel  flows,  which  explains  the  recent 

experimental  result  of  pipe  flow  by  Hof  et  al.  [14].    The  study  also  confirms  the  results  from 

asymptotic analysis (for Re → ∞ ) of the Navier-Stokes equations by Chapman [15]. He proposed 

a function of energy gradient and then took the maximum of this function in the flow field, Kmax, 

as  the  criterion  for  flow  instability.  This  approach  obtains  a  consistent  value  of  Kmax  for  the 

critical  condition  (i.e.,  minimum  Reynolds  number)  of  turbulent  transition  in  parallel  flows 

including plane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow [11-13]. In energy 

gradient  theory,  the  viscosity  only  plays  a  stability  role  because  large  viscosity  could  produce 

 

2

large  energy  loss  and  thus  stabilize  the  flow.  This  is  in  agreement  with  the  experimental 

observations. 

In this paper, the new proposed energy gradient theory is extended to curved flows. Then, 

based on the results, three important theorems for fluid dynamics are deduced. From these results, 

it is concluded that the classical Rayleigh theorem on inflectional velocity instability of inviscid 

flows is incorrect which has last for more than a century. 

2. Energy Gradient Theory applied to Curved flows 

The  energy  gradient  theory  has  been  described  for  parallel  flows  in  detail  in  [11]. 

Extending  the  theory  from  parallel  flow  to  curved  flow,  we  only  need  to  change  the  Cartesian 

coordinates (x, y) to curvilinear coordinates (s, n), to change the kinetic energy (

um ) to the 

total mechanical energy (

), and to make the  velocity (u) along the streamline.

Here, we use the same derivation steps as in [11].  

Let us consider the elastic collision of particles when a disturbance is imposed to the base 

of a curved shear flow (Fig.1). A fluid particle  P  at its equilibrium position will move a cycle in 

vertical direction under a vertical disturbance, and it will have two collisions with two particles 

(

1P  and 2P ) at its maximum disturbance distances, respectively. The masses of the three particles 

are  m , 

1m and 

2m , and the corresponding velocities prior to collisions are  u , 

1u and 

2u . We use 

primes  for  the  corresponding  quantities  after  collision.  Without  lose  of  generality,  we  may 

assume  m = 1m = 2m  for  convenience  of  the  derivation.    For  a  cycle  of  disturbances,  the  fluid 

particle may absorb energy by collision in the first half-period and it may release energy in the 

second  half-period  because  of  the  gradient  of  the  velocity  profile.  The  total  momentum  and 

kinetic energy are conserved during the elastic collisions. The conservation equations for the first 

collision on streamline 

1S  are

 are  the  volumes  of  the  particles,  and 1α  and 

1β  are  two 

constants and 

1α ≤ 1 and 

1β ≤ 1. The values of 

1α and 

1β  are related to the residence time of the 

particle at 

1P . If the residence time at position 

1P  is sufficiently long (e.g. whole half-period of 

 

 

 

 

3

disturbance),  the  particle  P  would  have  undergone  a  large  number  of    collisions  with  other 

particles on this streamline and would have the same momentum and kinetic energy as those on 

the  line  of 

1S ,  and  it  is  required  that 

1α =1  and 

1β =1.  In  this  case,  the  energy  gained  by  the 

particle P in the half-period is (

QE −1

EQ

). When the particle P  remains on S1 for less than the 

necessary half-period, of the disturbance,  the energy gained by the particle P can be written as

, where 

*β  is a factor of fraction of a half-period with

The  requirements  of  conservation  of  momentum  and  energy  should  also  be  applied  for 

the second collision on streamline 

2S , and similar equations to Eq.(1) and (2) can be obtained as 

in [1]. The difference is that the energy gained in the second half-cycle is negative owing to the 

disturbance  of  energy  in  base  flow.  For  the  first  half-period,  the  particle  gains  energy  by  the 

collision and the particle also releases energy by collision in the second half-period.  

We  use  the  (s,  n)  to  express  the  coordinates  in  streamwise  and  transverse  directions, 

respectively.  Using  the  similar  derivations  with  those  in  [11],  the  energy  variation  of  per  unit 

volume of fluid for a half-period for the disturbed fluid particles can be obtained as,

The  stability  of  the  particle  can  be  related  to  the  energy  gained  by  the  particle  through 

vertical disturbance and the energy loss due to viscosity along streamline in a half-period.

is streamwise length moved by the particle in a half-period.  

The  magnitudes  of  EΔ  and  HΔ determine  the  stability  of  the  flow.  After  the  particle 

moves  a  half  cycle,  if  the  net  energy  gained  by  collisions  is  zero,  this  particle  will  stay  in  its 

original  equilibrium  position  (streamline).  If  the  net  energy  gained  by  collisions  is  larger  than 

zero, this particle will be able to move into equilibrium with a higher energy state.  If the collision 

in  a  half-period  results  in  a  drop  of  kinetic  energy,  the  particle  can  move  into  lower  energy 

equilibrium. However, there is a critical value of energy increment which is balanced (damped) 

by  the  energy  loss  due  to  viscosity.  When  the  energy  increment  accumulated  by  the  particle  is 

less  than  this  critical  value,  the  particle  could  not  leave  its  original  equilibrium  position  after  a 

half-cycle.  Only  when  the  energy  increment  accumulated  by  the  particle  exceeds  this  critical 

value,  could  the  particle  migrate  to  its  neighbor  streamline  and  its  equilibrium  will  become 

unstable.   

The stability of a flow depends on the relative magnitude of  EΔ and  HΔ . For flow with 

a  curved  streamline,  with  similar  steps  as  in  [11],  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  energy  gained 

from  collision  and  the  energy  loss  due  to  viscous  friction  determines  the  disturbance 

amplification or decay. Thus, for a given flow, a stability criterion can be written as below for the 

half-period, by using Eq.(6) and Eq.(7),

Here,  F  is  a  function  of  coordinates  which  expresses  the  ratio  of  the  energy  gained  in  a  half-

field variable (function) and expresses the ratio of transversal energy gradient and the rate of the 

energy loss along the streamline. Here,

The  instability  of  a  flow  depends  on  the  values  of  K  and  the  amplitude  of  the  relative 

disturbance velocity 

v m'

u

. For any type of flows, it can be demonstrated that the variable K is 

proportional  to  the  global  Reynolds  number  for  a  given  geometry  [11].  F  increases  with  the 

Reynolds  number  Re.  For  given  disturbance,  the  maximum  of  K,  Kmax,  in  the  flow  domain 

determines the stability. Therefore, Kmax is taken as a stability parameter. For Kmax<Kc, the flow is 

stable; for Kmax>Kc, the flow is unstable.  Here, Kc is the critical value of Kmax. Since K~Re is still 

true for curved flows [11,12], the critical amplitude of the disturbance scaling with the Re is the 

same as flow parallel flows, with an exponent of -1.  

3. Derivation of theorems  

Theorem (1):  Potential flow (inviscid and 

×∇ V

0=

) is stable.

In this case, the value of K is indefinitive. We can do the following analysis. For potential flow, 

the mechanical energy is uniform in the flow field everywhere, the imposed disturbance could not 

be amplified without an energy gradient, no matter how large the disturbance amplitude is.  As 

the  result,  we  conclude  that  potential  flow  (inviscid  and 

×∇ V

0=

)  is  stable.  Therefore, 

turbulence could not be generated in potential flows. Uniform rectilinear flow is an example of 

potential  flow  in  parallel  flows.  For  the  basic  cases  of  potential  flow  such  as  uniform  flow, 

source/sink, free vortex, and corner flow, they are always stable.   

Theorem (2): Inviscid rotational (

The energy gradient in the transverse direction (due to rotational) is [16],  

Introducing Eq.(13) and Eq.(14) into Eq.(9), the value of K is,

(15) 

It is seen that for inviscid rotational flow, the transversal energy gradient is not zero, and the there 

is  no viscous energy loss in streamline direction  to damp the disturbance since it is  an inviscid 

flow. Thus, any imposed finite disturbance could be amplified by the transversal energy gradient 

(

∞=F

 in  Eq.(8))  at  enough  high  Re.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that  inviscid  rotational 

(

×∇ V

0≠

) flow is unstable. This theorem has important significance for climate dynamics and 

meteorology,  since  most  air  flow  over  the  atmosphere  boundary  layer  can  be  treat  as  inviscid 

rotational. This mechanism may be dominating in the formation of tornado. 

Theorem (3): Velocity profile with an inflectional point is unstable when there is no 

work input or output to the system, for both inviscid and viscous flows.

Proof: For inviscid flow, there is no energy loss along the streamline. For viscous flow, 

the  energy  loss  due  to  viscosity  is  zero  at  the  inflection  point  from  Navier-Stokes  equation

=0)  if  there  is  no  work  input  or  output  to  the  system  (meaning

The  addition  of  viscosity  only  changes  the  distribution,  and  does  not  off  its  value  to  zero. 

Introducing Eq.(16) and Eq.(17) into Eq.(9), the energy gradient parameter K at this point is, 

K

Thus, the value of function K becomes infinite at the inflection point and indicates that the flow is 

unstable when it is subjected to a finite disturbance (

∞=F

 in Eq.(8)). Therefore, we conclude 

that velocity profile with an inflectional point is unstable when there is no work input or output to 

the system for both viscous flow and inviscid flow. For both inviscid flow and viscous flow, this 

is  a  sufficient  condition  but  not  a  necessary  condition  for  instability.  If  there  is  work  input  or 

output  to  the  system,

 at  the  inflection  point,  then  this  theorem  is  not  established 

anymore.  

Velocity  inflection  could  result  in  instability  as  found  in  experiments  and  simulations, 

e.g.,  the  vortices  behind  the  cylinder  at  an  enough  high  Re.  People  regard  these  phenomena  as 

inviscid instability generally. According to present theory, no matter what the flow is inviscid or 

viscous, inflection necessarily leads to instability, not just inviscid instability. Actually, since the 

inflection is within the boundary layer in some cases, at least this instability is viscous. However, 

for inviscid flow, that inflection leads to instability is also correct.

4. Comparison with Experiments  

This  theory  has  been  applied  to  studies  for  Taylor-Couette  flow  between  concentric 

rotating cylinders [18]. This theory obtains very good agreement with the available experimental 

data  of  Taylor-Couette  flows  in  literature.  For  the  occurrence  of  primary  instability,  the  critical 

value  of  Kmax  is  a  constant  for  a  given  geometry  no  matter  how  the  rotating  speeds  of  the  two 

cylinders  for  all  the  available  experiments.  The  critical  value  of  Kmax  is  observed  from  the 

experiments at the condition of occurrence of primary instability for the case of the inner cylinder 

rotating and the outer cylinder set to rest.  These results confirm that the proposed theory is also 

applicable to rotating flows 

5. Rayleigh Theorem is incorrect 

Rayleigh’s  so-called  point-of-inflection  criterion  states  that  the  necessary  condition  for 

instability of inviscid flow is the existence of an inflection point on the velocity profile [1-6].    

According  to  this  criterion,  inviscid  flow  without  an  inflection  point  on  the  velocity 

profile is stable. This conclusion is contradicting to the Theorem 2 of this study. It is not difficult 

that the reader can judge which is correct between the two theorems. The Rayleigh’s theorem is 

only  deduced  from  mathematics  and  has  no  physical  background.  The  reason  why  Rayleigh’s 

theorem is incorrect can be found from the following.  

(1)  In  the  derivation  of  Rayleigh’s  theorem,  two-dimensionality  of  disturbance  is  assumed. 

Then,  the  Rayleigh  equation  for  inviscid  flow  is  obtained  using  a  stream  function  as  a 

variable.  As  we  know,  the  disturbance  is  necessarily  three-dimensional  in  reality.  An 

extension  in  one  direction  must  cause  the  compression  in  the  other  two  directions,  and 

vice versa (Fig.2). Even if the given disturbance at the beginning is two-dimensional, it 

can  develop  into  three-dimensional.  As  is  well  known,  there  is  no  stream  function  in 

three-dimensional  flows.  It  is  also  remembered  that  there  is  no  turbulence  in  two-

dimensional flows [19].  Even if this issue for three-dimensionality of disturbance could 

be  overcome  via  Squire’s  transformation  that  the  three-dimensional  disturbance  is 

transformed into a pseudo two-dimensional disturbance, the following problem exists.  

(2)  Another  issue  is  that  the  amplitude  of  the  traveling  wave  disturbance  is  assumed  to  be 

irrelevant  to  the  spanwise  direction,  and  is  only  a  function  of  transverse  coordinate, 

A=A(y).  Actually,  the  amplitude  of  traveling  wave  disturbance  may  vary  in  spanwise 

 

 

 

 

9

direction with the its propagating, A=A(y, z), and thus the maximum disturbance rotates 

with the axis in propagating direction. The amplitude of the resultant disturbance travels 

following  a  spiral  trace  in  shear  flows,  and  this  has  been  demonstrated  by  numerical 

simulations  and  experiments  [20,21,22].  Therefore,  the  assumption  of  A=A(y)  is 

incorrect and the obtained result does not accord with the physics of the flows.  

6. Conclusions 

 

 

 

The new proposed “energy gradient theory” which physically explains the phenomena of 

flow instability and turbulent transition in parallel shear flows is applied to curved flows. Then, 

three  important  theorems  for  fluid  dynamics  are  deduced.  These  theorems  are  of  great 

significance for the understanding of flow phenomena and the explanation of complex flows. In 

these  theorems,  viscosity  has  only  stable  role  to  the  flow  owing  its  leading  to  high  energy  loss 

which damps instability. From these results, it is concluded that the classical Rayleigh theorem on 

inflectional  velocity  instability  of  inviscid  flows  is  incorrect  which  has  last  for  more  than  a 

century. Therefore, Rayleigh theorem on inflectional instability should be corrected in future in 

the most text books.

Abstract

We have modified the  single  pulse  target experimental
facility[1]  on  the  Experimental Test  Accelerator II  (ETA-
II)  to  perform  the  double  pulse  target  experiments  to
validate  the  DARHT-II[2,  3]  multi-pulse  target  concept.
The 1.15  MeV,  2  kA  Snowtron  injector will  provide the
first electron pulse.  The 6  MeV,  2  kA  ETA-II beam will
be used as  the  probe  beam.  Our  modeling  indicates  that
the  ETA-II/Snowtron  experiment  is  a  reasonable  scaling
experiment.

1  INTRODUCTION

the  subsequent  pulses,  and 

The DARHT-II facility will provide four 2.1  mm  spot
size, x-ray pulses within 2 µs with their x-ray doses in the
range of several hundred rads at a meter for x-ray imaging.
To  achieve its  performance specifications, the  DARHT-II
x-ray converter material is inertially confined after it  turns
into  plasma by  the  heating  of  previous  beam  pulses[2].
Furthermore,  the  beam-target  interactions,  such  as  the
focusing by  backstreaming  ions  from  desorbed  gas  from
the target surface for the first pulse  and by  those  from the
target  plasma  for 
the
instabilities  of  the  beam  propagating  in  dense  plasma,
should  be  mitigated.  We  will  perform 
the  ETA-
II/Snowtron  double  pulse  target  experiments  to  validate
the DARHT-II multi-pulse target concept. To simulate the
DARHT-II beam-target interactions,  a  target  plasma  will
be  created  first  by  striking  the  1MeV,  2  kA  Snowtron
beam on  one side of  a 5  mil  Ta foamed target,  and then,
the  6  MeV,  2  kA  ETA-II  beam  will  enter  from  another
side to probe the target. The foam target density is  1/5  of
the  solid  Ta  density.  To  validate  the  DARHT-II  target
confinement concept and to  ensure generating the  required
x-ray dose, the  better  characterized  ETA-II  beam  will  be
used to hit the target first. We will then  measure the  x-ray
dose  created  by  the  Snowtron  beam  to  benchmark  our
hydrodynamics modeling and x-ray dose calculations.

In 

this  paper,  we  discuss 

the  Snowtron  beam
parameters and how  much  target  plasma  is  needed  to  do
the scaled multi-pulse target experiment in Sec. 2.  In  Sec.
3, the  hydrodynamics modeling of  the  target plasma with
the  Snowtron beam  parameters  is presented.  Both the  6

Since the fourth DARHT-II pulse has to travel through
the  longest  plasma column.  It  will  experience  the  worst
beam-target  interaction.  The  double  pulse  experiment  is
designed to  simulate  the  beam-target  interactions  for  the
third  and  the  fourth  DARHT-II  pulse.  The  DARHT-II
target plasma discussed in  this  section is  the  plasma seen
by  the  fourth  pulse  (the  worst  case).  The  Snowtron
injector was a predecessor of  the  ETA-II  injector.  The  1
MeV,  2  kA  Snowtron  injector,  using  a  velvet  cathode,
will  deliver a  70  ns  (FWHM)  long  beam  with  a  35  ns
flattop. The energy variation during the  flattop  is  ±  1  %.
The  injector  voltage  waveform  is  given  in  Fig.  1.  The
Snowtron beam’s normalized Lapostolle emittance is 1200

interactions,  the  ETA-II beam needs to  travel  through  an
over-densed  target  plasma  which  fully  charge-neutralizes
the beam and has a magnetic diffusion time of the  order of
1 ns. The plasma temperature should be similar  to  that  of

Assume  that  only  the  flattop  portion  of  the  Snowtron
beam  can  deposit  energy  into  a  small  spot  due  to
chromatic  aberration  of  the  lens,  and  ignore  the  energy
deposited by the rise and fall of  the  beam.  The DARHT-II
target is  a 1  cm  long  Ta foamed target with  1/10  of  the
solid  Ta  density[2].  To  achieve  the  temperature  of  the

need to focus the Snowtron  beam on  the  ETA-II target to
a 1 mm FWHM spot.

The  focusing  effects  of  the  target  plasma  and  the
backstreaming ions  can over-focus the  beam.  The  length
of the ion channel or the plasma column  needed to  disrupt
the  final focus spot  size R  is  proportional  to  R/(γ /I)1/2.
The plasma column  created by  the  Snowtron  beam  needs
only  40  %  of  the  DARHT-II  plasma  column  length  to
disrupt  the  ETA-II  beam.  Since  the  backstreaming  ion
channel  increases  in  time,  its  net  focusing  effects  also
increase  in  time.  The  time  needed  to  observe  the  beam
disruption,  after  the  backstreaming  ions  are  born,  also
follows  the  same  scaling.  For  the  case  that  the  beam
traveling  through  a  pre-existing 
the
backstreaming  ions  may  appear  as  soon  as  the  beam
arrives  at  the  target.  The  beam  disruption  time  for  the
ETA-II  beam  is  only  40  %  of  that  for  the  DARHT-II
beam. Therefore, it is easier to  observe the  backstreaming
ions’ focusing effects on the ETA-II beam.

3  SNOWTRON TARGET PLASMA

We  have  modeled  the  target  plasma  created  by  the
Snowtron beam  using  the  LASNEX hydrodynamics code.
We  assume  that  the  Snowtron  beam  has  a  Gaussian
distribution.  The  energy  deposited  by  the  non-flattop  of
the beam is ignored. The deposited energy is  distributed in
the  target  according  to  a  Monte  Carlo  calculation  using
the  MCNP  code.  The  third  DARHT-II  pulse  will  travel
through  a 1.1  cm  long  plasma column.  According to  the
discussion in  the  previous section,  the  ETA-II  beam  has
to  travel through  a 0.5  cm  plasma column  to  experience
similar beam-target interactions.  The Snowtron  plasma at
the ETA-II side will have expanded approximately 0.5  cm
at  1  µs  after  the    Snowtron  beam  hits  the    target.
Therefore, firing  the  ETA-II  beam at

this  time  can simulate  the  beam-target interaction for the
third  DARHT-II  pulse.  The  density  contours  of  the
simulated target plasma for the  third  pulse  are  shown  in
Fig. 2. The  foamed target is  located at  z = 2.3  cm  in  the
plot. Due to the low  beam energy, the  large scattering by
the  target  makes  the  electrons  in  the  Snowtron  beam
deposit more energy at the entrance side of  the  target than
at the exit  side. Therefore, there is  less  plasma expansion
at  the  exit  side.  The  corresponding  plasma  density  and
temperature along  the  z-axis are shown  in  Figs.  3(a)  and
(b). The ETA-II beam’s number density is 5.3 x 1013 c.c.-1
which  is  much  less  than  that  for  the  target  plasma.
Therefore, the  beam  is  full  charge   neutralized   by    the
target.  The Snowtron  plasma’s temperature  is  about  half
of  the  DARHT-II  plasma.  The  magnet  diffusion  times
varies from 0.01 ns to 1  ns  depending on  the  beam radius
along  the  axis.  Therefore,  the  interactions  between  the
ETA-II beam  and  the  Snowtron  target  plasma  would  be
similar  to  that  between the  DARHT-II beam and   and its
target plasma. Similarly,  to  simulate  the  fourth DARHT-
II pulse’s beam-target interaction, the ETA-II beam should
be fired at 1.5 µs after the Snowtron beam.

5  CONCLUSIONS

We have modified the  single  pulse  target experimental
facility on  the  ETA-II to  perform the  double pulse  target
experiments to  validate the  DARHT-II  multi-pulse  target
concept. By using the 1.15 MeV, 2 kA Snowtron beam  to
generate a target plasma and then  firing  the  6  MeV,  2  kA
ETA-II beam at  an appropriate time,  we can simulate  the
beam-target interactions for various DARHT-II pulses.

4  FINAL FOCUS

The configuration for the Snowtron beamline is shown
in  Fig.  4.  In  order 
to  provide  enough  space  for
diagnostics, the  final focus  magnet  (AP  magnet)  for  the
ETA-II target experiment has a large inner bore with an ID
of  39.4  cm,  and  the  ETA-II  target  is  located  inside  a
focusing  magnet  near  the  center.  Therefore,  the  same
magnet will  also  be  used  to  focus  the  Snowtron  beam.
Since  the  Snowtron  beam  energy  is  much  less  than  the
ETA-II  beam  energy,  two  iron  sleeves  will  be  inserted
from the Snowtron side of the magnet to reduce the  excess
magnetic field. A 23.5 cm long sleeve with  a thickness  of
5.35  cm  is  located near the  center of  the  final  lens.  The
second  sleeve,  17.5  cm  away  from  the  end  of  the  first
sleeve, is  30  cm  long  and 0.635  cm  thick.  Both sleeve’s
ID are 22  cm.  The excitation of  the  final focus lens  will
be set  by  focusing the  ETA-II beam to  a 1  mm  FWHM
spot.  The  nominal  focusing  field  is  4800  Gauss.  A
solenoid  (M80)  is  placed  between  the  two  sleeves  to
match the Snowtron  beam from the  injector exit  into  the
final focus region for a 1 mm  FWHM  spot  size also.  The
M80 magnet is 15.4 cm in length  and has  an 18.2  cm  ID
and a 25.4  cm  OD.  These two  sleeves  and  the  matching
lens can also be moved in and out as a unit to improve the
tunability  for the  Snowtron  beam.  According the  MCNP
calculation,  about  half  of  the  Snowtron  beam  electrons
will  be backscattered to  the  backward  hemisphere[4].  We
estimate  that  approximately  half  of  these  backscattered
electrons  would  be  confined  by  the  final  focus  field  to
within  the  Snowtron  beam  radius  in  the  final  focus
region.  However,  we  do  not  anticipate  any  serious
problems in  focusing the  Snowtron  beam in  the  presence
of these backscattered electrons. Since  the  sleeves and the
matching  solenoid  are  movable,  we  can  adjust  their

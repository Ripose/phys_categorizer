Abstract: This paper analyzes the quantitative relations between stock prices and quantities 

of tradable stock shares in Chinese stock markets at six time points by means of Exploratory 

Data Analysis (EDA) method. It is found the resulting formulae have the same structure but 

different parameters. This paper also uses these relationships in order to analyse the feasibility 

of policies for Chinese Government to sell the state-owned shares in Chinese stock markets

Introduction: 

 

 

Chinese  stock  markets  (i.e.  Shanghai  stock  market  and  Shenzhen  stock  market)  are 

immature and have their own characteristics. First, their structures are different from the most 

western stock markets. They have two different kinds of stock shares; one is tradable in both 

stock markets, which are held by ordinary investors, and the other is not tradable in both stock 

market which are held by the government known as state-owned shares（Zhou，2003）. Second, 

the prices of stock shares are highly influenced by the quantity of their tradable stock shares 

as  shown  in  figure  1.  Moreover,  Chinese  government  always  intends  to  sell  state-owned 

shares in Chinese stock markets so that this causes great potential system risk to the markets. 

For  example,  Chinese  government  wanted  to  sell  the  state-owned  shares  in  Chinese  stock 

markets  from  12  June  2001  to  24  June  2002.  This  action  made  the  markets  crash  down. 

Shanghai Index fell from 2245 to 1335. Eventually the government had to stop their selling 

action.   

Why did the government fail to sell their shares? Is there a win-win solution? More than 

2000  proposals  about  selling  state-owned  shares  were  handed  in  to  Chinese  Securities 

Regulation Commission after it called for proposals about selling state-owned shares in Nov. 

2001.  Among  these  proposals,  the  consensus  of  markets  prefers  the  share-adjusted  plan, 

which means to adjust the proportion of tradable shares to state-owned shares. This plan has 

two operation proposals: one is to shrink the state-owned shares, which is called the shrinking 

totally tradable plan; the other is to split-up tradable shares, which is called the split-up totally 

2

tradable plan. Specialists and ordinary investors think these two plans are equivalent. Is this 

really true?     

This paper first analyzes the quantitative relations between stock prices and quantities 

of tradable stock shares in Chinese stock markets at six time points by means of Exploratory 

Data Analysis (EDA) method. Then this paper uses these relations to analyse the feasibility of 

policies for Chinese Government to sell the state-owned shares in Chinese stock markets   

2  The Quantitative Relations between Stock Prices and Quantities of Tradable Stock 

Shares 

 

 

From both Shanghai stock market and Shenzhen stock market, I select 240 stocks which 

belong to five groups: medicine manufacture, steel manufacture, appliance manufacture, car 

manufacture  and  gasoline  manufacture.  The  criterion  of  selecting  sample  groups  is  that  the 

groups  have  wide  span  of  quantities  of  stock  shares.  I  analyze  the  relations  between  stock 

prices and quantities of tradable stock shares at six time points by using the 60-day-average 

prices. By means of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) method (Hoaglin, 1998,), I obtain the 

quantitative relations between stock prices and quantities of tradable stock shares at six time 

points (referring to figure 2, Gou, 2003), which are shown as following.

where  a  is  associated  with  the  average  prices  of  the  whole  stock  markets;  b  represents  the 

price structure according to the quantities of stock shares; and c is determined by the size of 

quantities of stock shares in the whole markets. 

We can find out that because the average prices reduced from Jane, 2001 to Jane, 2002,     

parameter  a  became  smaller  but  parameter  b  stayed  almost  the  same,  seeing  figure  3  and 

figure  4.  After  Jane,  2002,  parameter a  still  became  smaller  and  parameter  b  became  larger

gradually. This change is probably due to the new concept about value investment proposed 

by institutional investors. However, the structure of formula (7) still holds all the time.

3.1  The Reason for the Failure of Selling State-owned Shares 

 

Although  Chinese  government  only  wanted 

to  sell  10%  state-owned  shares 

accompanying with IPO and refunding of listing companies during the period from 12 June 

2001 to 24 June 2002, the markets had the anticipation that the state-owned shares would be 

totally tradable in the markets in the uncertain future. This made the markets crash. According 

to  formula  (7),  we  can  understand  why  the  markets  crashed.  I  use  formulas  (1)  and  (3)  to 

calculate  the  prices  of  sample  companies  under  the  condition  that  the  state-owned  shares 

would  be  totally  tradable.  This  is  to  say,  use  total  quantity  of  shares  (tradable  shares  + 

state-owned  shares) 

in 

formulas 

(1)  and 

(3) 

to  calculate 

the  simulated  prices 

~y

and 03

01

~y which  I  call  as  totally-tradable  prices.  Fig.5  shows  that 

~y

, 

01

~y

03

  are  much 

lower  than 

01y 、 03y which  are  60-day  average  prices  on  2001/6/29  and  2002/6/30, 

respectively.  Max,  median,  min  and  average  of

01y

,

03y

,

~y

, 

01

03

and  the  differences  of 

these prices are listed in table 1. From table 1, we can see the average prices would drop at 

least  34%  if  the  state-owned  shares  would  be  totally  tradable  at  that  time.  Moreover,  stock 

markets  will  crash  once  they  form  falling  tendency  because  stock  markets  are  positive 

feedback  systems.  In  fact,  the  Chinese  stock  markets  would  drop  further  if  the  government 

had not stopped selling state-owned shares.

3.2 Effect on the Markets of the shrinking Totally Tradable Plan

  Zhang proposed the formula for the shrinking totally tradable plan (Zhang, 2002): 

Shrinking proportion = (real market prices)/ (net asset per share)                                  (8) 

New total shares = (tradable shares) + (state-owned shares)/ (shrinking proportion)     (9) 

To calculate the simulated prices 

~y   under the condition of shrinking totally tradable 

11

plan on 2001/6 /29, I use formulas(1), (8) and(9), in which tradable shares, state-owned shares 

and net assets per share are obtained from the half-year reports of listing companies in June 

2001 and 

01y
~y   are lower than 01y

11

are 60-day average real market prices on 2001/6 /29 . As shown in Fig. 6，most 

, which means the shrinking totally tradable plan would make prices 

of stock shares fall if it were carried out at that time. Table 2 shows prices would fall at 14% 

averagely according to this calculation.

3.3 Effect on the Markets of the Split-up Totally Tradable Plan 

 

 

 

 

 

Zhang gave the following formulas for the split-up totally tradable plan (Zhang 2002): 

Split-up proportion = (real market prices)/ (net asset per share) 

               

      (10) 

New total shares = (state-owned shares) + (tradable shares)*(split-up proportion)          (11) 

Split-up prices = (real market prices)/ (split-up proportion) 

 

         

 

      (12) 

I  use  formulas(10),(11),  (12)  and  (1)  to  calculate  the  simulated  prices 

~y   under  the 

21

condition  of  the  split-up  totally  tradable  plan  on  2001/6  /29,  in  which  tradable  shares, 

state-owned shares and net assets per share are obtained from the half-year reports of listing 

companies  in  June  2001  and  60-day  average  real  market  prices

on    2001/6  /29  .  As 

01y

shown in Fig. 7，nearly all 

~y   are greater than split-up prices

21

01y

, which means the split-up 

totally tradable plan would make prices of stock shares go up potentially if it were carried out 

at  that  time.  Table  3  shows  prices  would  go  up  at  159%  averagely  according  to  this 

calculation.

3.4 Suggestions to Policy-makers and Foreign Investors 

In Chinese stock markets, the quantitative relations between stock prices and quantities 

of tradable stock shares are the key factor to determine stock prices. Because of unawareness 

. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10

of  this,  Chinese  government  failed  to  sell  state-owned  shares  in  the  markets.  The  shrinking 

totally tradable plan will make the markets form a going-down anticipation, which will form 

bear  markets.  So  the  shrinking  totally  tradable  plan  is  not  doable.  In  contrast,  the  split-up 

totally tradable plan could be a win-win solution for Chinese government to sell state-owned 

shares  in  Chinese  stock  markets.  Because  this  plan  will  make  the  markets  form  going-up 

anticipation,  which  will  probably  make  money  flow  into  the  markets  so  as  to  produce 

money-making  effect.  This  will  attract  more  money  into  the  markets  so  that  bull  markets 

could form. The government could sell state-owned share in bull markets successfully. 

In  order  to  make  the  split-up  totally  tradable  plan  carried  out  successfully,  two  steps 

should be followed: first, split-up the tradable shares so that the state-owned shares obtain the 

right to be traded in the markets; second, make a schedule for state-owned shares to be traded 

in the markets, that is to say, the state-owned share can not be sold in the markets at the same 

time,  but  must  be  sold  gradually.  If  the  state-owned  shares  which  are  huge  flood  into  the 

markets, the markets can not afford. 

Chinese stock markets are opened to foreign investors under certain condition. Foreign 

investors  can  invest  in  Chinese  stock  markets  through  Qualified  Foreign  Investment 

Institutions  (QFII).  Before  they  make  investment  decision,  they  need  to  know  the 

characteristics  of  Chinese  stock  markets.  First,  they  must  be  aware  of  the  quantitative 

relations between stock prices and quantities of tradable stock shares; second, they must pay 

attention  to  the  system  risk  of  Chinese  stock  markets  due  to  the  state-owned  shares.  The 

proportion  of  state-owned  shares  to  total  shares  in  the  Chinese  stock  markets  is  two  thirds. 

Therefore, Chinese government is a huge player in the markets actually. It is potential system 

 

11

risk that whatever decisions the government will make about state-owned shares.   

 

4  Conclusion:   

1)  In  Chinese  stock  markets,  the  quantitative  relations  between  stock  prices  and 

quantities of tradable stock shares are the key factor to determine stock prices. All 

participants in Chinese stock markets including investors and Chinese government 

need to pay attention to it when they make any decisions. 

2)  The  split-up  totally  tradable  plan  could  be  a  win-win  solution  for  Chinese 

government to sell state-owned shares in Chinese stock markets.

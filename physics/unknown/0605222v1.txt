Oscillations of a System of Coupled Oscillators 
with a Virtod-Type Virtual Cathode
A. E. Hramov

 

Abstract
—The results of numerical modeling of oscillations in a system of two coupled oscillators operating
on the basis of a virtual cathode (VC) with controlled external feedback are presented. It is shown that there
exist the modes with generation of chaotic signals and synchronization modes with high signal-to-noise ratio.
The effect of parameters of the electron beam and external feedback on the generation frequency of the system
and phase relations between the signals generated in each module is analyzed.

1. 

Microwave oscillators, in which an electron beam
with  the  virtual  cathode  (VC)  is  used  as  an  active
medium—the  so-called  vircators  [1]—are  promising
devices  of  relativistic  electronics.  The  VC  devices
attract an interest of researchers ﬁrst of all because they
are characterized by simple design, high level of gener-
ated power (from hundreds of megawatt to thousands of
gigawatt), and the possibility of controlling the device
by an external microwave signal. The latter constitutes
the main condition that allows one to apply vircators as
units of phased arrays (see, for example, [2–4]). A clas-
sical scheme of sending the control signal to a vircator
system is based on the assumption that the external sig-
nal inﬂuences directly upon the VC (see [3–5]). How-
ever, such an approach requires a high power level of
the  control  signal,  which  hampers  practical  applica-
tions  of  such  systems.  In  this  way,  we  note  an  array
module [6] operating on the basis of the virtod-type vir-
cator [7]. In this case, an external signal that inﬂuences
upon  the  electron  beam  in  the  acceleration  domain
leads  to  modulation  of  the  ﬂow  that  enters  the  drift
space; according to experimental investigations of the
modulation  of  high-current  electron  beams  [8],  the
required level of the control signal can be decreased by
an  order  of  magnitude.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  well
known  that  a  preliminary  modulation  of  the  electron
beam strongly inﬂuences the VC dynamics [9]. In [9], I
demonstrate  the  possibility  of  synchronizing  oscilla-
tions  in  the  diode  gap  with  overcritical  current  and  a
preliminarily modulated electron beam at the modula-
tion  frequency;  in  this  case,  the  phase  difference
between the control signal and the signal generated by
the VC oscillations tends to zero, which is an optimal
condition providing an increase in the output power of
a multi-module system.

In  this  paper,  I  present  the  results  of  numerical
investigation of oscillations in a system of two coupled
virtod-type  oscillators.  Oscillation  characteristics  of
the system in the synchronization mode are of primary
interest;  I  also  analyze  the  dependences  of  the  fre-
quency and phase relationships of oscillations in each

The physical system under consideration is simu-
lated by a set of two identical vacuum diodes; a high-
current  electron  beam  with  the  relativistic  factor 
  =
0
3.5  is  injected  into  the  system.  The  beam  current  is
denoted by 
, respectively, for the ﬁrst and sec-
ond  diodes.  Before  entering  the  interaction  space  of
each virtod, the beam is modulated in a narrow gap by
the  electromagnetic  signal  taken  from  the  interaction
space of another virtod; this signal is sent to the modu-
lator with a certain delay in time. I consider a reditron
model of the vircator [10]; according to this model, the
electrons reﬂected from the VC are completely fallen
out on the anode, which prevents the accumulation of
oscillating  charged  particles  in  the  cathode–VC  gap.
Such  a  scheme  enables  us  to  increase  the  signal-to-
noise ratio and efﬁciency of the energy transformation
as compared with the classical vircator [11, 12].

method [14].

3. According to the results of numerical experiment,
a  system  of  coupled  virtods  demonstrates  different
operation  modes  depending  on  the  parameters  of  the
feedback  line.  When  coupling  coefﬁcient  A  corre-
sponds  to  m  <  10%,  the  coupling  is  negligible,  and
oscillations in each virtod are almost autonomous. As
the coupling coefﬁcient increases, the mode of chaotic
generation  and  the  mode  of  synchronization  with  the
high signal-to-noise ratio in the spectrum are observed
depending on the frequency mismatch of the oscillator.
The mode of synchronization takes place when α1 and
α2  are  close  (the  frequency  mismatch  ∆f =  |f2  –  f1
|  is
small, where f1 and f2 are the oscillation frequencies in
the autonomous modes corresponding, respectively, to
α1 and α2) and the modulation depth m ~ 10–20%.

Figure 1 shows the zones of synchronization, quasi-
synchronization, and chaotic generation in the coupled
system constructed for m = 15% on the plane of param-
eters τ and α1/α.

We  see  that  when  the  frequency  mismatch  of  the
oscillators is small (∆α < 1), the mode of synchroniza-
tion in the system is observed when the signals of both
oscillators are regular and have the same frequency; the
phase difference between these signals takes a certain
ﬁxed value ∆φ that does not vary in time. When the cou-
pling between the moduli is symmetric, the synchroni-
zation domain on the plane of parameters gets narrow
as the delay time increases.

The  results  of  numerical  experiment  have  shown
that the width of the synchronization strip ∆f strongly
depends on the value of coupling coefﬁcient A. In the
range  of  A  that  corresponds  to  the  modulation  depth
m ~ 10–15%, the width of the synchronization strip ∆f
can be estimated as

Figure 2 shows the characteristics of oscillations in
each oscillator determined at different moments of time
during  the  action  of  the  pulse  of  accelerating  voltage
sent to the diodes without any time shift. Figure 2a dis-
plays the pulse shape and the time intervals correspond-
ing to the power spectra and projections of the phase
portraits of the electric-ﬁeld oscillations in the ﬁrst (two
right  columns)  and  second  (two  left  columns)  diodes
presented  in  Fig.  2b. The  phase  portraits  were  recon-
structed  by  the  method  of Takens  [15].  Note  that  the

current of the second diode is greater than that of the
ﬁrst diode.

Figure  2  illustrates  the  process  of  establishing  the
mode of synchronization in the coupled system. In the
beginning of the pulse of accelerating voltage, the spec-
trum of the oscillation power in each virtod is close to
the noise spectrum [Fig. 2, (1)]. However, electrostatic
instability in the ﬂow of the second diode with a large
current  develops  faster  than  in  the  ﬂow  of  the  ﬁrst
diode. In the spectrum of the second oscillator depicted
in Fig. 2, (1), one can follow a weakly expressed peak
(denoted by the arrow) that occurs at the frequency of
oscillations in the autonomous diode with the same cur-
rent.  This  leads  to  a  deep  modulation  of  the  ﬂow
injected to the ﬁrst diode, in which the VC is not yet

 

formed. The ﬂow modulation in the ﬁrst diode exerts a
pronounced inﬂuence on the conditions of the forma-
tion of the VC in this diode [9]. In time [Fig. 2, (2)],
when the VC formation in the ﬁrst diode continues (and
its oscillation frequency is close to the generation fre-
quency  of  the  second  diode  due  to  the  preliminarily
modulation of the ﬂow), the intensity of inﬂuence on
the ﬂow in the second diode increases. As a result, the
generation  frequency  of  both  moduli  is  tuned  to  the
mean frequency. The mean frequency is close to the fre-
quency of autonomous oscillations in the second diode
with a large current, which is caused by the aforemen-
tioned processes that occur at the initial stage. As the
time  increases  further,  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  in  the
spectrum of the generation power of the system rises,
the  synchronization  frequency  and  its  harmonics  are
clearly  distinguished,  and  the  noise  pedestal  drops  to
the level of –45 dB in the domain of the ﬁrst harmonic
of the synchronization frequency and rapidly decays as
the frequency increases [Fig. 2, (3, 4)].

The duration of the transition process that leads to
the  establishment  of  regular  oscillations  strongly
depends  on  parameters  of  the  feedback  line.  If  mis-
match ∆α is sufﬁciently large, then, when A increases,
the duration of the transition process increases at small
τ  and  decreases  at  large  τ.  If  the  mismatch  is  small
(∆α (cid:2) 1), the inﬂuence of parameters of a symmetric
external  feedback  on  the  system  behavior  is  much
weaker; however, the introduction of an asymmetry to
the system caused by unequal values of times τ
1 and τ
2
enables one to control the phase relationships between
the signals in each module (see below).

Figure 3 illustrates the dependence of the generation
frequency of the system on the ratio α
2 determined
in the mode of synchronization for different τ and the
generation frequency of the autonomous oscillator ver-
sus the beam current (curve 1). Here, α
2 = 2.2. As can

1/α

be seen, the introduction to the system of the external
delayed  feedback  yields  a  decrease  in  the  generation
frequency of the coupled system as compared with the
autonomous  diode.  When  the  duration  of  the  delay
increases,  the  frequency  decreases.  The  maximum
readjustment  of  the  generation  frequency  within  the
range of variation of τ is

(∆f/f)max ~ 20%.
Considering the possibility of applying the system
under study as a module of a phased array, one should
note the importance of analysis of phase relationships
between microwave signals in each virtod.

Figure 4 shows the phase difference ∆φ between the
signals  in  each  virtod  versus  the  delay  time  τ  deter-
mined at the ﬁxed α
1 = 2.2. We see that, by varying the
delay time τ, one can readjust the phase difference in
sufﬁciently broad limits; when the mismatch of oscilla-
tors is large, the inﬂuence of ∆α on the phase difference
is  weak.  When  the  mismatch  of  oscillators  is  small
(∆α (cid:2) 1), the effect of the delay time of the symmetric
coupling (τ
2) on the phase difference ∆φ is negligi-
ble (curve 2).

1 and τ

Introducing an asymmetry to the system connected
with different delay times τ
2), one can
control the value of ∆φ in such a manner that the gener-
ation frequency remains almost unchanged. As can be
seen from Fig. 5, a variation of the delay time τ
2 at a
ﬁxed τ
1 enables one to readjust the phase difference in
sufﬁciently broad limits. For example, at τ
1 = 14 ps, ∆φ
varies from 20 to 90° with respect to τ
2. An increase in
the  ﬁxed  delay  time  τ
1  deteriorates  the  monotonic
dependence of ∆φ with respect to increasing τ
2. Note
that  when  coupling  coefﬁcient  A  (or  the  modulation
depth of the ﬂow injected to the drift space, which is the
same) increases, the phase difference between oscilla-

Fig. 5 that correspond to m ≈ 15 and 25%).

When the delay times τ

i > 2.5 ns, the mode of syn-
chronization is destroyed, and the system passes on the
mode of chaotic oscillations through alternation [16].
In  this  case,  the  time  realizations  of  the  electric-ﬁeld
oscillations  in  each  virtod  have  the  form  of  periodic
sequences  broken  by  irregular  splashes. As  the  delay
time  increases,  the  duration  of  the  laminar  phase  of
oscillations shortens.

In the domain of quasi-synchronization, the oscilla-
tions  in  each  module  occur  at  one  deﬁnite  frequency
and,  in  this  case,  the  mutual  quasi-synchronization
between the moduli takes place (that is, synchroniza-
tion with a small difference between the frequencies of
the  signals  generated  in  each  module;  the  frequency
difference depends on time and oscillates close to the
zero mean value).

Chaotic  oscillations  are  observed  in  the  system
when  the  mismatch  of  oscillators  is  large  (∆α  >  1);
these oscillations get complicated as the delay duration
and mismatch ∆α increase. In this case, there is a high
noise  pedestal  in  the  spectrum  of  each  virtod,  which
slowly  decreases  as  the  frequency  increases,  and
weakly expressed peaks of the main frequency f(α
i) and
its subharmonics are observed on the background of
noise.  The  dimensionality  D  of  the  reconstructed
attractors  calculated  by  the  Grassberger–Procaccia
algorithm [17] strongly depend,

as well as the phase portraits, on the system parameters.
The  value  of  dimensionality  D  is  fractional,  which  is
evidence of chaotic oscillations in the system. As the
delay time increases, the dimensionality of the recon-
structed  attractors  and,  consequently,  the  oscillation
complexity, increase; this effect is observed even when
the  mismatch  of  the  oscillators  is  small  (see  Fig.  1,
where  the  narrowing  of  the  synchronization  domain
that occurs as τ increases is distinctly seen). When the
coupling between the moduli is asymmetric (τ
2), a
rigid  transition  to  the  mode  of  chaotic  oscillations
through alternation takes place. One may conclude that
an increase in the delay time yields a complication of

the  system  dynamics.  Note  that  a  similar  effect  is
observed in the autonomous virtod. As is shown in [18],
an  increase  in  the  delay  time  of  the  external  delayed
feedback  yields  a  transition  to  the  mode  of  chaotic
oscillations in the electron beam with a VC. Thus, the
above  analysis  enables  one  to  consider  the  system
under study operating in this mode as an oscillator of
chaos that can be easily readjusted.

4. The study of the system of two coupled oscillators
operating on the basis of virtod-type VCs has demon-
strated the possibility of controlling the characteristics
of such systems by varying the parameters of the exter-
nal  feedback.  The  dependence  of  both  the  frequency
and generation frequency band on the delay time of the
feedback line is observed. An asymmetric variation of
the delay time in the mode of synchronization makes it
possible  to  readjust  the  phase  difference  between  the
signals in each module within the limits 0–π/2. Thus,
the results obtained enable one to consider the system
under  study  as  a  component  of  systems  with  a  larger
number  of  the  degrees  of  freedom,  for  example,  pulse
phased arrays operating on the basis of parallel vircators.

Abstract 

The  energy  doubling  of  the  Frascati  DAΦNE  Φ-
Factory  can  be  accomplished  either  by  ramping  the 
energy  of  the  rings  from  the  initial  510  MeV  of  the 
injected beam or by upgrading the present Linac energy to 
>  1.02  GeV  so  to  inject  the  beam  at  full  energy.  The 
choice  between  the  two  options  is  not  the  goal  of  this 
paper,  which,  instead,  presents  some  technical  solutions, 
which permit to re-use all the components of the DAFNE 
electron-positron Linac.  

THE FRASCATI LINAC 

It consists mainly of two parts:  
1)  The  low-energy/high-current  section  made  up  of 
five  S-band  SLAC-type  3  meters  accelerating 
structures. The maximum achievable energy, on the 
Positron  Converter  (PC),  is  250  MeV  at  zero 
electron current. In real operation, with 10 nsec, 5 
amperes  electron  bunches  at  the  PC,  the  energy 
conversion is 220 MeV.   

2)  The  high-energy/low-current  section  made  up  of 
ten  SLAC-type  accelerating  structures.  It  can 
accelerate  the  positron  bunches  emerging  by  the 
PC, up to the maximum energy of 550 MeV. 

 
The  SLAC-type  structures  are  travelling  wave  (TW) 
constant gradient (CG) units and are fed by sledded RF 
pulses. Four RF stations provide the power by means of 
45  MW  klystrons.  A  sketch  of  the  DAFNE  Linac  RF 
layout is shown in figure 1. 
 
The main parameters of the DAFNE Linac are reported 
in table 1.

A drift space of about 15 meters is available at the linac 
output for the installation of other accelerating structures. 
Additional  space  is  available  to  house  even  more 
structures,  in  the  straight  tube  after  the  spectrometer 
magnet and in the transfer line tunnel before entering the 
main ring hall.    

DAFNE LINAC UPGRADING 
The  extra  energy  needed  to  inject  at  full  energy  in 

DAFNE2 is > 510 MeV.  

Two solutions can be proposed to increase the energy 
a)  addition of new accelerating structures without any 

modification of the present machine; 

b)  addition of new accelerating structures with a new 
layout of the linac to increase the energy gain of the 
existing SLAC sections.   

 

 

The SLAC structures features 

In  TW/CG  accelerating  structures,  the  voltage  Vb 
(beam loading) induced by a bunch of peak current I0 and 
duration tb, very short with respect to the filling time tf, is 
given by the following expression [1,2]:

with: Rsh = shunt impedance (MΩ/m)  
          L = structure length (m) 
          τ = attenuation constant (Np)  
   xb = tb/tf  (defined in Figure 3). 
 
In the SLAC structures, the above parameters are: 
 
 τ = 0.57 Neper  
 Rsh ≈ 53  (MΩ/m) 
 L = 3 meters 
 
From  the  equation  (1), Vb  ≈  1.1 MV/amp,  thus, in  the 
high  energy  section  of  the  Frascati  Linac,  the  beam 
bunch 
loading 
electron/positron current does not exceed a few hundreds 
of mA.

Linac Energy Upgrading  a) 

As  shown  in  figure  4a,  it  is  possible  to  upgrade  the 

Linac energy by adding 6 new accelerating structures. 

With 3 new 60 MW RF stations and by enhancing the 
RF  pulse  with  the  SLED  energy  compressor,  up  to  80 
MW  peak  power  can  be  delivered  to  each  accelerating 
structure.  In  this  case,  the  energy  gain  per  section, 
according to the expression (3), is 93 MeV, i.e. 31 MV/m. 
The total extra energy is therefore 560 MeV which, added 
to the actual 510 MeV, gives an overall output energy of 
about  1070  MeV,  with  5%  of  contingency.  The  space 
needed  to  install  6  new  accelerating  units  is  about  20 
meters. The operation at the average accelerating field of 
31  MV/m,  even  though  feasible  with  the  current  RF 
technology [4], is challenging and requires much care in 
manufacturing,  vacuum  processing  and  RF  conditioning 
the  accelerating  structures  and  the  SLED’s.  Also,  this 
version needs more powerful and costly RF stations with 
respect to the existing ones.  

The  figure  4b,  instead  shows  the  energy  upgrade 
achieved  with  12  low  field  (16  MV/m)  new  units  and  2 
new  RF  stations  of  the  same  kind  of  those  already 
installed.  The  maximum  achieved  energy  is  1090  MeV. 
This  solution  may  be  somewhat  cheap  and  very  reliable 
from  the  operational  point  of  view.  The  required  extra 
length  to  house  12  units  is  however  40  meters  and  the 
occupation of the transfer line space would be necessary.  
 

Linac Energy Upgrading  b) 

The Linac energy doubling can be achieved, as shown 
in  figure  5,  by  upgrading  the  accelerating  field  of  the 
existing  8  units  and  by  adding  just  4  new  SLAC-type 
sections  to  reach  1100  MeV.  The  Linac  waveguide 
network  must  also  be  modified  in  order  to  supply  two 
accelerating  units  per  station.  The  present  accelerating 
structures,  which  now  operate  at  about  17  MV/m,  will 
need  new  bake-out  and  RF  conditioning  to  dissipate 
higher peak power. The system requires two new 45 MW 
klystrons.  Sufficient  room  to  install  four  additional 
accelerating structures is available in the drift space at the 
Linac  end.  The  average  RF  field  is  26.5  MV/m  that  is 
today easily attainable. 

CONCLUSIONS 
Upgrading the Frascati Linac to inject at full energy in 
the  DAFNE2  complex  is  feasible  at  moderate  cost  by 
adopting the solution b, providing new arrangement of the 
waveguide  network  and  new  RF  conditioning  of  the 
existing accelerating sections to operate at higher field.

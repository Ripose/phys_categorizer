ABSTRACT

Novel nonlinear  optical effects  - photonic flame effect  (PFE)1,2 and stimulated globular scattering (SGS)3   -   have  been 
discovered. SGS was observed both in forward and  backward direction. Pure  opal crystal, consisting of the close-packed 
SiO
 globules with diameter 200 nm, and crystal with pores, filled with  molecular liquid, have been studied.  Two Stokes 
2
components, shifted  from  the  exciting  light  frequency by  0.4 –  0.6 cm-1 , have  been  observed  in  SGS.  Photonic  flame 
effect  consisted in the appearance  of the few  seconds’ duration emission  in blue-green spectral  range  under 20 ns ruby 
laser pulse excitation.

INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals have attracted  great attention since the first papers concerning such structures4-6. Unlike usual crystals 
such structures  have   special  periodicity of  dielectric constant with  a  period  of  the electromagnetic  wavelength  order. 
One-, two- and three-dimensional photonic crystals exhibit the  remarkable properties, which can be effectively used for 
photon fluxes processing due to the existing of the photonic band gap. Different types of modes defined by the periodical 
structure of photonic crystal   and the  possibility of  different photonic crystal structure production  lead to the  important 
possible applications. The  study  of the  linear optical properties  of the  photonic  band  gap  have  been the  task  of  many 
theoretical and experimental works  and still remain the task to be  investigated7,8 . The description of the electromagnetic 
field inside the photonic crystal structures (obtained by transfer matrix method9 or coupled mode theory10) gives the clear 
picture  of  the  transmitted  and  reflected  spectrum,  electromagnetic  field  distribution  inside  the  crystal  and  their 
dependence  on the  parameters  of  the  photonic crystal structure  (values  of  period, number  of  periods, refractive  index 
contrast).  Large  values of  the  electromagnetic  field  localization  in some  regions  lead to  the  expectation of  the  strong 
enhancement  of  nonlinear  wave-matter  interaction  in  comparison  with  bulk  crystals.  Second  harmonic  generation  in 
different  types  of  photonic  crystals  was  investigated  in works11,12 .  Properly chosen  photonic  crystal  exhibits  negative 
refraction at some conditions13. Some features of the stimulated Raman scattering  in one-dimensional photonic structure 
was  considered14.  Fully  quantum  mechanical  treatment  of  the  generation  of  entangled  photon  in  nonlinear  photonic 
crystals at the  process of  down-conversion was  realized  in15. Photonic  band gap  properties which are  demonstrated by 
photonic crystals are  being actively  used for  investigation of  photon-exciton interaction16. Very  important kind  of  3-D 
photonic  crystals   is globular photonic  crystal  built  of  globules (balls)  with  diameter,  which  may be  comparable  with 
visible light wavelength. In nature such crystals exist as  mineral - opal, consisting of quartz nanospheres.  Space among 
these spheres (or globules) is filled with different inorganic materials.  Recently technology  of synthetic opals producing 
is developed7,8,17 . Such opals  have  3-D periodical structure  and  are  built  of  ordered close-packed  quartz  globules with 
diameter 200-600 nm, organizing 3-D face-centered cubic lattice.

Because  the  refractive  index  contrast  in  opal  (ratio  n

)  is about  1,45  the  complete  photonic  band  gap  in  such 
air
structure does  not exist  but the photonic  pseudogap takes place.  Empty cavities among these globules have  octahedral 
and tetrahedral form. It is possible to investigate both initial opals (opal matrices) and nanocomposites, in which cavities 
are  filled with  organic or  inorganic materials, for  instance, semiconductors, superconductors, ferromagnetic substances, 
dielectrics, displaying different types of nonlinearities.
 Acoustic  modes  excited  in  SiO
  balls  which  compose  opal  photonic  crystal  show  the  effect  of  phonon  modes 
2
quantization18 and are the reason of stimulated globular scattering3. Specific features of the acoustic wave propagation in 
the photonic structures  lead to the possibility  of the diverging ultrasonic beam focusing  into a  narrow focal spot with a 
large focal depth19. 
In the case  of the different kinds of  molecular liquids infiltrating the  opal crystals some  types of stimulated  scatterings 
can be observed: stimulated Raman  scattering  (SRS), stimulated  Brillouin scattering  (SBS) and  others. Peculiarities  of 

spontaneous Raman  scattering  in  photonic  crystals  has  been  described  in20.  Spontaneous  Brillouin  scattering  in  such 
structures has been observed in18.  In this work we present experimental observations of new types of secondary radiation 
arising  in photonic  crystals  (synthetic  opals)  under  excitation  with  giant  pulses  of  ruby  laser: stimulated  scattering  in 
synthetic opals  and  opal  nanocomposites  -   stimulated  globular scattering  (SGS)  and  new  nonlinear  effect  -  photonic 
flame effect (PFE).   SGS effect consisted in the appearance of one or two Stokes components, shifted from the exciting 
light frequency by 0.4 – 0.6 cm-1. In PFE we observed few seconds long radiation in blue-green wavelength range under 
excitation with  20  ns ruby  laser pulse. The  luminescence  could appear with  some  delay  in time  in  other opal crystals 
spatially separated with  the crystal, illuminated by the laser light.

2.  EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE AND SOURCES OF EXCITATION

max

Ruby laser giant pulse   ((=694.3  nm, (=20  ns, E
 =0.3 J) has been used as  a  source of nonlinear effects  excitation in 
photonic crystals. Exciting light has been focused  into the  material by lenses with different focus (50, 90, and 150 mm). 
Sample  distance  from  focusing  system  and  exciting  light  energy  also  changed,  which  gave  possibility  to  make 
measurements for  different  power  density  at  the  entrance  of  the  sample  and  for  different  field  distribution  inside the 
sample.  Investigations  have  been  fulfilled  for  different  energetical  and  geometrical  conditions.  Fabri-Perot 
interferometers with different  bases  have been used for SGS spectral  structure  investigations, which  gave possibility to 
change the range  of  dispersion from  0.42   to  1.67 cm-1. The samples  of  opal crystals  used  had the  size 3x5x5mm and 
were  cut parallel to the  plane (111)   .The angle of the  incidence of the laser beam on the plane (111)   varied from 0 to 
600.   Opal crystals consisting of the close-packed amorphous  spheres  with diameter 200  nm and  nanocomposites (opal 
crystals with  voids filled  with  acetone  or  ethanol) were  investigated.   The  experimental results  did  not  depend on the 
angle  of  incidence  of  the  laser  beam.   It  is necessary  to  mention  that  opal  matrix,  saturated  with  acetone  or  ethanol 
became practically transparent, because  refractive indexes of such nanocomposites components (opal matrix and  liquid) 
were  near.  It allowed  observing  light scattering  in  forward  direction. PFE  has been  registered with  the  help of  digital 
camera.  Spectra, observed during PFE  investigations, have been studied with  the  help of  mimi-spectrometer with fiber 
waveguide. Obtained spectra  have been compared with the spectra  of emission under UV  excitation. Light diodes have 
been used as a source of excitation in this case.

INVESTIGATIONS OF SGS

Principal scheme of the experimental setup for SGS study is shown at the Fig. 1.

Ruby laser (1)  light has been focused  into the photonic crystal (10) with  the  lens (9). System (3) has been used 

for  pumping  light  parameters  control;  systems  (4  and  12)  measured  SGS  energy  in   backward  and  forward 

direction.  Mirror  (8)  has  been  used  to  register  initial  light  spectrum  simultaneously  with  the  scattered  light 
spectrum. In some experiments it was put away. Fig.2 shows  interferogram of  the ruby laser oscillations. We can 
observe system of rings, width of which characterizes spectral width of the initial light. For our laser it was 0.015 
cm-1.

Experimental results

Under ruby laser giant pulse excitation we observed both in opal matrix and in nanocomposites (opal matrix with 
pores filled with  liquids) stimulated scattering of a new type - stimulated globular scattering (SGS). SGS  in pure 
crystal was  observed  in  backward  direction  (opposite  to  the  initial pumping  beam)  for  pumping  light  power 
density more than 0.12  GW/cm2 and  its frequency shift was  0.44 cm-1. Energy conversion of the  laser light into 
the SGS light was about 0.1 - 0.4. The divergence of the scattered  light was of the order 10-3 rad. Fig.3a presents 
interferogam of the scattering from opal matrix. The  line width of the scattered light was of the order of the laser 
light line width.

Two  ring  systems  are  observed,  which  correspond  to  the  pumping  laser  light  (ring  of  larger  diameter)  and  SGS  in 
backward direction in opal. If we put away  mirror 6, reflecting  laser light  (see Fig.3), only one system  of rings is left at 
the interferogram. This case is shown at the Fig. 3b.

We  have  also studied  SGS  in  nanocomposites  –  opal crystals with  pores  between  quartz  globules filled  with  liquids: 
ethanol or acetone. We registered SGS in such structures  both in forward and  backward direction. In backward direction 
for  exciting  light  power  more  than  0.12  GW/cm2  we  observed  in  opals  both  with  ethanol  and  acetone  first  Stokes 
component with frequency shift  0.4 cm-1. Increasing of the pumping power density resulted  in the appearance  of second 
Stokes component  with  frequency shift  0.65 cm-1 for  acetone and  0.63 cm-1 for  ethanol.  Spectra  of  backward SGS  in 
acetone are shown at the Figures 4a and 4b.

 Larger  ring corresponds  to  the  laser  light, smaller  rings  –  to  the  SGS.  Backward  SGS  spectrum  in  opal,  filled  with 
ethanol, is presented at the Fig.5. In this spectrum two Stokes SGS components are observed. Ring, corresponding to the 
laser light is not observed, because mirror 6 is put away.

                                      Range of dispersion is 1.67 cm-1.

In forward direction we  observed  in opal nanocomposites  only one  Stokes component of  SGS with frequency shift  0.4 
cm-1 both for ethanol and acetone.  Forward SGS spectrum in opal filled with acetone is presented at the Fig.6.

Ring with  larger diameter  corresponds to  the  laser light, with  smaller  diameter –  to  SGS.  Spectrum  of nanocomposite 
with ethanol is similar.

3.3  Discussion of the  results
       We compared our experimental results with eigenvalues of quartz globules vibrations. Vibrations of a spherical 
elastic body have been considered in21.  They applied for this purpose Lamb's theory dealing with the free vibrations of a 
homogeneous elastic body of spherical shape under stress-free  boundary condition. The equation of motion of such body 
is

We  can  see  that  good  agreement  exists  for  pure  opal  matrix.  Liquids,  filling  pores  between  quartz  globules,  may

4. PHOTONIC FLAME EFFECT INVESTIGATIONS

 Experimental setup

Experimental arrangement for PFE study is shown at the Fig. 7. Few photonic crystals (synthetic opals) have been placed 

on the Cu  plate,  put  into the  cell  with  liquid nitrogen. The  distance  between crystals was  from  1 to  5  cm. One  of the 

crystals (3) was  illuminated by giant pulse of ruby  laser. Luminescence of the crystals was registered by a digital camera 
and processed at the computer. Spectrum of the luminescence was registered with the help of minipolychromator.

 Observation of  the photonic flame effect

2

PFE has been observed at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (77 K).  For appropriate cooling  opal crystal was  placed at 
the Cu  plate, which  was  partly immersed  into  liquid N
.    Opal  crystal has  been  illuminated with  20 ns  pulse  of ruby 
laser. The  laser beam was  focused to the  surface  of the crystal . Light spot  diameter at the crystal corresponded to the 
laser beam waist dimensions and was of the order  0.01 mm. Under this excitation few seconds long luminescence in the 
opal  appeared  in  the  blue-green  range  of  spectrum.  Dimensions  of  this  shining  spot  were  few  mm  and  varied  in 
dependence  of  the  excitation  conditions.  The  luminescence  duration  was  from  1  to  4  seconds  and  it  looked  like 
inhomogeneous spot changing its spatial distribution and position on the surface of the crystal during this time.   PFE has 
been  observed both  in  opal  matrices  and  in  nanocomposites  (opals  with  empty  spaces,  filled  with  liquids: acetone  or 
ethanol), Parameters  of the secondary emission (duration, threshold) were  determined by the geometric characteristic of 
the illumination and the refractive index contrast of the sample. For optimal geometry of the excitation the power density 
threshold for  opal crystal was  0.12  Gw/cm2, for  opal crystals filled with  ethanol –  0.05  Gw/cm2, for  opal crystal filled 
with  acetone  –  0.03  Gw/cm2.  Typical  secondary  emission  temporal  distribution  measured  for  the  part  of  the  crystal 
displaying  the  most  intensive  brightness  is  shown  on  the  Fig.8.  The  same  behavior  is  typical  for  all  cases  of  the 
secondary emission at these conditions of excitation, but the value of  its duration fluctuated from shot to shot (~ 50%). 
The  dependence  was  close  to  constant   and  contained  some  maximum.  Sometimes  it  was  possible  to  observe  few 
maximums, which were seen by naked eye as light flashes appearing from time to time. 

Fig.8. Temporal distribution of the visible luminescence.

Very interesting peculiarity of the effect is possibility of excitation transfer to other crystals, placed at the distance of few 
cm from illuminated sample.  Few opal crystals have  been placed on the Cu  plate and only one  of them was  excited by 
focused laser pulse. When the threshold was reached, this crystal began to emit  light. Bright shining of the other crystals 
began  with  some  time  delay  after  laser  shoot.  The  value  of  this  delay  (and  the  intensity  of  the  luminescence)  was 
determined by the spatial position  of the crystals on the  plate. The distance between crystals was  few  cm (up to  5 cm, 
which was  determined by dimensions  of the  Cu  plate). Steel screen  placed between crystals did  not prevent excitation 
transfer if distance from lower edge of the screen to the Cu surface was more than 0.5 mm. In  order to show  the role  of 
the material of the plate used we repeated these experiments with plates of the same size but made of steel and  quartz on 
which opal crystals were placed like in the previous experiments. Luminescence of the same kind in the irradiated crystal 
took place but the luminescence of the other samples situated on these plates was not observed.  Polishing of the Cu plate 
upper  layer  (removing  of  the  oxides  film)  resulted  in  the  threshold  increase  of  energy  transfer  and  decrease  of  the 
luminescence intensity. The duration of the other crystals luminescence was of the order of several seconds and temporal 
behavior was  like shown on Fig.8. The typical features of such distribution were existence of maximum and  large plateau 
with near constant value of the intensity.

The  effect  was  also determined  by  the  angle  of  incidence.  For  the  samples  used  the  value  of  the  angle  was  chosen 

experimentally for achieving of the maximal value of the luminescence (it worth to  mention that this value differed from 
0  and  was  about  400).  Easier  the  effect  was  excited  in  the  unprocessed  samples.  In  Fig.9  one  can  see  the  secondary 
emission of the crystals situated at the distance of about 1 centimeter from the crystal which was irradiated.

Spectrum consisted of the sharp  lines with wavelengths: 429.0, 453.0, 489.0, 555.0, 643.0 nm, which corresponds to the 

antistokes spectral  range  for  exciting  line  694.3  nm.  Lines  intensity  in  the  spectrum  strongly  depended  on  the  laser 
pumping  intensity, which  was  evidence  of stimulated  type  of the  radiation  emission.  Maximums observed  except  line 
643.0 nm  correlate well with  opal spectrum secondary emission under UV excitation, which  is evidence of multiphoton 
character of the observed light emission. In this connection it is interesting to compare spectra of radiation arising in PFE 
with secondary emission spectra of synthetic opals excited by UV. 

 Setup and methodic for study  of the opal secondary emission spectra excited by  UV radiation

Spectra  of  secondary radiation  in amorphous  quartz  were  studied  earlier  at  excitation  by short-wave  electromagnetic 
radiation in view of the big width of the forbidden zone of this material. As  it was found out, at excitation by a  line 255.3

2.0 mm  thick.  Secondary radiation  gathered  from  a  surface  opposite to  illuminated, with  the  help of  a  quartz  optical 
waveguide with  cross  section  diameter  of  the  photoconductive  channel,  equal  200  microns.  Secondary  radiation  was 
brought by this optical waveguide to tiny p

5. CONCLUSIONS

Thus,  we  discovered  experimentally  two  new  nonlinear  effects:  photonic  flame  effect  and  new  type  of  stimulated 
scattering -  stimulated  globular  scattering.  It  was  observed  in globular  photonic  crystals,  created  on the  base  of  opal 
matrices.  We  observed  the  effect  both  in  pure  synthetic  opal  crystals  and  in  opal  nanocomposites,  in  which  pores 
between globules are  filled  with  molecular liquids: acetone and  ethanol. The  effects  had threshold character  and were  
was observed for peak power of the ruby laser giant pulse more than 107 W and for lens focus 90 mm.

The main features of PFE are:

At  the  excitation  of  the  artificial  opal  crystal  which  is  placed  on  the  Cu  plate  at  the  temperature  of  the  liquid 
nitrogen by the  ruby  laser  pulse  of the  nanosecond range  long-continued optical luminescence  takes place  in the 
case if the threshold of the process        is reached;                                                                                              
In the case  of   several opal crystals being put on the Cu plate while one  of them is being   irradiated bright visible 
luminescence occurs in all samples;                              
Temporal behavior and thresholds  of the  luminescence have been determined. Photonic     crystals  infiltrated with 
different nonlinear  liquids and  without  infiltration have been  investigated. Investigated transport  of  the excitation 
between the samples spatially separated  by the  length of  several centimeters  gives  the  possibility  of the  practical 
applications of  PFE.

 The photonic flame effect can have different explanation. Probably an essential role is played by plasma properties. The 
slow  transport  of  the  excitations  from  the  irradiated  crystal  to  other  photonic  crystals  can  be  associated  with  sound 
waves created due to laser pulse interaction with the sample. Exciton mechanism and surface  waveguides on the surface 
of the Cu  plate also can  play important role.  It was  checked that the change of  the properties of the  plate surface  was 
leading to  change  of  the  photonic flame effect.  Removing  the  oxide  layer from  the  plate changed  the threshold  PFE. 
Also  some  analogy  with  sonoluminescence  which  inspired  the  recent  studies  of  nonstationary  Casimir  effect  (see, 
e.g.22,23  ) deserves a  discussion. We will present the details of the photonic flame effect, e.g.  spectral characteristics of 
the light emitted by the photonic crystals in future publication.     

Observed  frequencies  of  stimulated  globular  scattering  are  in  good  agreement  with  eigenvalues  of  quartz  globules, 

composing opal crystal. Exciting opal matrixes with  high-power  laser pulses we  can expect also appearance  of another 
nonlinear  effects,  for  instance,  stimulated  Raman  scattering,  3-photon  and  4-photon  parametric  processes,  nonlinear 
excited  luminescence,  optic  harmonics  excitation,  hyper-Rayleigh  and  hyper-Raman  scatterings.  We  hope  that  both 
spontaneous  and  stimulated  globular  scattering  will  give  possibility  to  obtain  information  about    eigenfrequencies 
spectrum of different materials consisting of spherical nanoparticles including albumen globules, viruses and so on.

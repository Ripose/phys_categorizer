We present a theoretical attack on the classical problem of intermittency and anomalous 

scaling in turbulence. Our focus is on an ideal situation: high Reynolds number isotropic 

turbulence driven by steady large scale forcing. Moreover, the fluid is incompressible and 

no confining boundaries are present. We start from a good set of basis functions for the 

(cid:71)
velocity  field.  These  are  real  and  divergence-free.  To  each  wave-vector  k

in  Fourier 

space there is one pair of basis functions with respectively left and right-handed polarity. 

(cid:71)
Isotropy  makes  all  k

(cid:71)
on  the  shell  of  constant  k

  statistically  equivalent.  Consequently, 

the  coefficients  ,  χ+ and  χ− ,    to  the  basis  functions  in  that  shell  become  two  random 

variables  whose  joint  pdf  describes  the  statistics  at  scale 

2 / kπ=(cid:65)

.  Moreover, 

(

becomes a random variable for the energy. Switching to polar coordinates, 

the joint pdf expands in azimuthal modes. We focus on the axisymmetric mode which is 

itself a pdf and characterized by it radial profile 

P r (cid:65) .  Observations from both shell

model and DNS data indicate that (1) the moments of 

P r (cid:65)  scale as power laws in  (cid:65) ,

and  (2)  the  profile  obeys  an  affine  symmetry

1. Introduction 

Symmetry  is  our  leitmotif  for  this  paper.  Symmetry  has  a  long  history  in  theoretical 

physics  and  has  led  to  many  key  results.  It  is  possible  that  symmetry  may  also  resolve 

classical problems in turbulence.  There, symmetry shows up in statistical properties.  In 

the case of turbulence driven by steady forcing, for example, time-independence occurs 

only in a statistical sense: averages over an ensemble of flow realizations are stationary, 

but individual realizations vary chaotically with time. Similarly, Frisch (1995) points out 

that far away from boundaries, turbulence may restore the symmetries of Navier Stokes 

equations statistically. Turbulence may also develop new symmetries in addition to those 

native to Navier Stokes equations (i.e., Frisch 1995 p 17). To see how this is possible, let 

us think of Navier Stokes equations as a dynamical  system  with  an attractor describing 

equilibrium  turbulence.  The  attractor  occupies  a  small  subset  of  phase  space. 

Conceivably,  this  subset  can  have  a  self-similar  structure,  for  example  when  sliced  by 

scale. This way, new symmetries can emerge when we restrict Navier Stokes equations to 

the subset. We can thus speak of “attractor symmetries.”  Let us give a simple illustration

is  a  globally

/dx dt

x= −   ,   
2

/dx dt

x= .  In  that  scenario,  we  have  rotational  symmetry  on  the 

attractor,  but  not  elsewhere.  So  we  have  an  attractor  specific  symmetry.    Suppose  we

of this concept. Imagine a dynamical system

                                                                                                       

consider a large ensemble of solutions to (1.1) then the symmetry emerges statistically in 

the  long  time  limit.  For  example,  we  will  see  it  in  the  moments:

large time asymptotic pdf of our ensemble:

While  vastly  more  complicated  than  (1),  3D  turbulence  also  has  attractor  specific 

symmetries. One example is the dissipation range. Away from boundaries, the dissipation 

range  is  generally  believed  to  be  universal  when  expressed  in  the  proper  units,  i.e.,  the 

Kolmogorov scale  Kolη , and dissipation ε.  Another example, is the inertial range at high 

Reynolds numbers where “scaling exponents” for various structure functions are thought 

to be universal; e.g., Frisch (1995).  

 
Symmetry performs best under idealized circumstances.  Problems under that rubric are 

precisely those one would expect to have been solved eons ago. In other mature fields of 

science  such  problems  are  textbook  material  and  their  solutions  constitute  established 

indisputable  knowledge.  That  is  not  the  case  for  turbulence.  The  unresolved  nature  of 

even  the  most  fundamental  and  simple  problems  justifies  turbulence  reputation  as  “the 

last great problem in classical physics”.  Although the origin of this quote is unclear, the 

quote  is  by  no  means  trite.  The  fact  that  basic  problems  remain  unsolved  is  of  greater 

theoretical  significance  than  the  complexity  arising  from  turbulent  flows  having  a  huge 

number of degrees of freedom.  Moreover, the lack of basic theoretical results impedes 

turbulence modeling.

One unresolved problem involves steady large scale forcing of isotropic 3D turbulence at 

a high Reynolds number in an incompressible fluid with constant properties. In absence 

of boundaries, we have all possible simplifications in our favor. Naturally, this problem 

has a long history. It is thus well known that a universal  “inertial (sub)range” develops. 

This range covers length scales where inertial forces rule. These scales are much smaller 

than  the  forcing  scale,  but  also  much  larger  than  the  dissipation  scale.  In  the  large 

Reynolds  number  limit,  the  inertial  range  becomes  infinitely  wide.    To  analyze  the 

statistics  in  the  inertial  range,  structure  functions  of  velocity  differences  between  two 

points  are  traditionally  used.    Say  the  points  are  P  and  Q,  then  velocity  increments 

(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:71)
parallel and perpendicular to PQ

are of interest. Because of isotropy the statistics of these 

differences depend only on the separation distance 

PQ=(cid:65)

 between the two points. It is 

known that the statistical moments of the velocity differences obey power laws, i.e.,

Relying  on  the  idea  that  the  physics  is  the  same  everywhere  in  the  inertial  range, 

Kolmogorov (1941) used (1.4) to suggest scaling laws for all moments:

This  symmetry  is  known  as  statistical  self-similarity,  and  occurs,  for  example,  in 

Brownian  motion  (e.g.,  Embrechts  &  Maejima  2002).    The  linear  scaling  exponents 

pζ =
p

/ 3

  are called “K41 scaling”.  We note the exponents p/3 do not specify the shape 

of the pdf φ(cid:38) . That also requires the coefficients 

. Even then, knowing all the integer 

(cid:4)
pC(cid:38)

order  moments  may  not  be  enough  to  uniquely  specify  φ(cid:38)   because  of  “Haussdorff’s 

moment problem” ; see Koerner (1988) p 21.  

A large body of evidence refutes K41 scaling in the inertial range of 3D-turbulence; see 

e.g., Frisch (1995), Benzi et al (1995), Sreenivasan & Antonia (1997), Katul, et al (2001). 

That is, the scaling exponent is a nonlinear function of p. Equivalently, the pdf’s do not 

collapse  according  to  (1.6).  As  shown  in  Figure  2,  the  tails  of  the  pdf  flare  out  and 

thicken with decreasing  (cid:65)  even after normalizing by the standard deviation.  That means 

fluctuations  of  many  standard  deviations  become  increasingly  more  likely  with 

decreasing (cid:65) . Such deviation from statistical self-similarity constitutes “intermittency” as 

defined by Frisch (1995) p 121.  In his definition, the issue is not much the pdf deviates 

from a Gaussian, but that the dependence on  (cid:65)  deviates from (1.6). Correspondingly, the 

structure  functions  are  said  to  scale  “anomalously”  when 

ζ

/p p Const
≠

.    Interestingly, 

 

 

5

the  longitudinal  and  transverse  scaling  exponents  (i.e., 

pζ(cid:38)

  and 

pζ⊥ )  are  different,  but 

seem  related  through  a  simple  formula;  see  Siefert  &  Peinke  (2004,  2006).    Also,  in 

contrast to pζ(cid:38)

, 

pζ⊥ can be obtained for non-integer orders.  

A  key  difference  between  K41  and  anomalous  scaling  is  the  existence  of  an  intrinsic 

scale 

o(cid:65) .  Statistical  self-similarly  (1.6)  does  not  provide  one,  so  a  reference  scale  is 

supplied  from  elsewhere.    K41  usually  uses  the  integral  scale,  which  depends  on  large 

eddies  outside  the  inertial  range.    Being  larger  than  the  scales  in  the  inertial  range,  the 

integral  scale  says  something  about  where  the  inertial  range  begins.  Similarly,  the 

dissipation scale,  Kolη , says something about where the inertial range stops.  Neither the 

beginning nor the end can be found directly from (1.6) alone. In principle,  (cid:65)  could run 

from  zero  to  infinity  in  (1.6).  For  anomalous  scaling,  however,  (cid:65)   cannot  run  to  zero 

without violating inertial range scaling laws.  We illustrate this point using longitudinal 

structure functions.  For any random variable R, we have

Thus,  anomalous  scaling  laws  can  never  be  extended  to  all  (cid:65)   like  K41.    Whether  the 

second factor is positive on the infrared or the ultraviolet side depends on the sign of the

 (Frisch 1995 p 131, Benzi et al 1995). Consequently, 

(1.8) shows that the anomalous scaling laws terminate on the infrared side at some

which is then an intrinsic length scale.   

Let us reconsider the statement that  

pζ  must be concave down in the inertial range.  It is 

indeed  an  exact  result,  if  properly  qualified.    Schwarz’s  inequality  for  any  random

 is the difference quotient for

pζ  is 

concave  up  when  q  is  positive  and  concave  down  when  q  is  negative.    The  inequality 

(1.10)  can  not  be  satisfied  for  all  (cid:65)   when 

q ≠ .    In  the  ultraviolet  limit,

inequality  is  satisfied  when 

q < and  hence

pζ must  be  concave  down.    In  the  infrared 

(cid:65)
limit,  → ∞

,  the  inequality  requires 

q > and  hence 

0

pζ must  be  concave  up.    The 

classical  inertial  range  sits  between  a  large  forcing  scale  and  an  arbitrary  small 

 

 

7

dissipation scale. That is the ultraviolet limit, where 

pζ  must be concave down.  On the 

other  hand,  were  we  to  consider  small  scale  forcing  and  a  cascade  from  small  to  large 

scales  (e.g.,  Gibson  1996)  then  the  infrared  limit  would  come  in  play  and 

pζ would  be 

concave up.  

 Besides concavity, the literature (e.g., Frisch 1995) mentions to two other constraints on 

pζ .    One  states  that 

pζ   must  be  an  increasing  function  of  p.    The  other  is  “Novikov’s 

inequality”  stating  that 

pζ

0

p ≤   (see Frisch 1995 p 172, Novikov 1970). We dispute both constraints. Let us clear 

0

up these issues now so that they will not be of concern later. 

The  argument  leading  to 

pζ   being  an  increasing  function  rests  on  the  assumption  of  a 

largest  velocity.  Without  this  assumption,  supersonic  velocities  could  be  present  and 

violate the use of the incompressible Navier Stokes equations.  The counter argument is 

that  the  incompressible  equations  constitute  a  complete  mathematical  framework.  Once 

we decide to work within that framework, we must accept its inherent statistics, whatever 

they are. No additional “modeling constraint” such as a largest velocity may be imposed. 

The fact that the incompressible framework gives an incorrect description of real physical 

flows at very high speeds is a different matter.  If the incompressible statistics show that 

the  velocity  can  become  unbounded  then  we  must  accept  that  compressible  corrections 

are required to describe real flows.  

 

 

 

 

8

To arrive at the Novikov inequality, one considers structure functions for the dissipation 

at  scale (cid:65) .  The  corresponding  scaling  exponents  are  called 

pτ .    It  is  believed 

that

pζ
−
p

/ 3

=

τ
p

/ 3

 is the correction to the K41 scaling.  We do not dispute this relation 

provided  that  the  structure  functions  for  the  dissipation  are  defined  appropriately.    The 

latter  point  comes  down  to  how  the  “dissipation  at  scale (cid:65) ”  should  be  defined.    In  our 

view, an appropriate definition involves transforming the physical space dissipation (i.e., 

2
ε ν=

S S
ij

ij

, where ijS  is the strain rate tensor) to Fourier space and filtering according to 

scale, i.e., 

(cid:65)

. In contrast, the common usage defines the dissipation at scale  (cid:65)   

(cid:71)
2 / kπ=

as  the  average  of  2

S Sν
ij

ij

  over  a  sphere  of  radius  (cid:65) .      Correspondingly,  the  p’th  order 

structure  function  is  the  average  of  (

S Sν
2
ij

ij

p

)

  over  a  sphere  of  radius  (cid:65) .      With  that 

definition,  Novikov’s  inequality  follows  from  the  mathematical  fact  that  the  integral  of 

the positive function  (

S Sν
2
ij

ij

p

)

is a non-decreasing function of the radius of the sphere 

(see Frisch 1995, p 173). Once the usual definition of the dissipation structure function is 

accepted,  Novikovs  inequality  follows.  Our  objection  is  that  this  traditional  definition 

also includes all scales smaller than  (cid:65) .  If we use Fourier space to filter the dissipation 

according to scale then Novikov’s inequality disappears.  

A  large  variety  of  models  exist  for 

pζ ,  a  small  partial  list  includes  Kolmogov  (1962), 

Parisi  &  Frisch  (1985),  She  &  Leveque  (1994),  Lundgreen  (2006).  Generally,  most 

models agree with observations so long p  is  moderate.    In  particular,  the  “log-Poisson” 

model  (She  &  Leveque  1994)  is  famous  for  faithfully  reproducing  experimentally 

 

 

9

observed exponents (e.g., Benzi et al 1995).  For large values of p, the models produce 

widely  differing  results.  It  would  then  seem  that  experiments  and  direct  numerical 

simulations  should  easily  be  able  to  reject  most  models  on  the  basis  of  high  order 

exponents.  Unfortunately,  the  reality  is  different  because  high  orders  exponents  are 

difficult to obtain accurately from data, e.g., Wit (2004). One of the obstacles is that one 

has  to  work  with  a  finite  sample.  The  moments  of  a  finite  sample  can  be  expected  to 

agree with those of the continuous pdf when the order is low, but at high order the two 

kinds  of  moments  are  certain  to  disagree,  possibly  catastrophically.  In  particular,  we 

point out that a finite sample can be viewed as a pdf with compact support. Moments of 

unreasonably high orders will act accordingly. In fact, they can act in such a way as to 

support  the  idea  of  a  monotone pζ .    For  these  reasons,  we  must  view  high  order 

exponents with skepticism. Many models (e.g., Kolmogorov 1962) are often thought to 

misrepresent  high  order  exponents  on  the  grounds  that  (1) 

pζ     is  not  monotone,  (2) 

Novikov’s  inequality  is  violated,  or  (3)  there  is  strong  disagreement  with  experimental 

data. In light of our arguments, no model can be rejected for those reasons. 

This is paper is motivated by the idea of symmetry.  From a classical point of view, we 

should expect symmetry in the inertial range because the same physics, inertia, rule at all 

scales. Thus, we search for a global scaling invariance for the inertial range, such that the 

full  statistics  at  one  scale, (cid:65) ,  suffice  to  generate  the  full  statistics  at  all  other  scales 

through  a  similarity  formula.    We  approach  this  symmetry  issue  with  a  new  set  of 

variables  for  describing  turbulence.  These  variables  are  introduced  in  Section  2.  In 

contrast to most of the literature, we do not work with physical space velocity increments, 

 

 

10

but  with  amplitudes  in  Fourier  space.    Correspondingly,  our  scale  (cid:65)   is  defined  three 

dimensionally in Fourier space and not as a separation between points in physical space.  

Our  variables  suggest  symmetry  and  where  to  look  for  it.  We  observe  the  expected 

symmetry  in  turbulence  data.  The  data  comes  from  both  a  shell  model  and  DNS. 

Moreover, the data does exhibit intermittency in the usual sense; see Figure 2.  Justified 

by observations, Section 2 states the symmetry as a hypothesis (H1) and augments it with 

the  traditional  power  law  assumption  (H2).    Together,  H1  and  H2  are  taken  as  exact 

properties of turbulence. The key question is this: under what circumstances can both H1 

and  H2  be  satisfied.  We  analyze  this  question  in  Section  3.  The  result  is  a  functional 

equation for intermittency with K41-scaling as the trivial solution.  Section 4 solves this 

equation completely, thereby providing both all scaling exponents 

pζ  and all coefficients 

pC .  The intrinsic length scale 

o(cid:65)  for anomalous scaling also shows up.  Section 5 wraps 

up the analysis by examining properties of the solution and finding the pdf corresponding 

to 

pζ and 

pC .  Section 6 presents the complete set of formulas for the structure functions 

and the underlying pdf. Section 6 also concludes the paper with a discussion of why the 

choice of variables matters.     

 

 

2. The Setup: Variables, Observations and Assumptions 

Navier  Stokes  equations  for  an  incompressible  constant  property  fluid  describe  the 

evolution  of  a  solenoidal  (i.e.,  divergence  free)  vector  field.  Two  real  scalars  suffice  to 

describe such a field. For example, two Clebsch potentials can do the job, e.g.,  u ϕ ψ= ∇

. 

(cid:71)

However, we want our scalars to describe the velocity in a way that reflects the left-right 

symmetry  in  Navier  Stokes  equations.  This  we  can  accomplish  by  using  the  “complex 

11

helical  waves  decomposition”;  see  Lesieur  (1990).  It  uses  eigenfunctions  of  the  curl 

operator  as  basis  functions.  Those  separate  into  two  kinds,  left  and  right  handed, 

according  to  the  sign  of  the  corresponding  eigenvalue.  The  decomposition  is 

straightforward to perform in Fourier space and provides us with two amplitudes, 

(cid:71)
(
u k−

)

 

and 

(cid:71)
(
u k+

)

(cid:71)
,  for  each  wave  vector    k

.    The  amplitudes  are  related  to  the  Fourier

Hereby,  conjugate  symmetry  is  identically  satisfied.    Thus,  we  have  no  constraints  on 

χ− and  χ+ .  Corresponding to  χ− and  χ+  we have real basis functions. These we obtain 

by introducing  χ− and  χ+  into the complex helical waves decomposition. The result is:

Our two scalars thus build the energy from their square sum in a Cartesian fashion.   

Our  scalars,   

(cid:71)
( )kχ−

and 

(cid:71)
( )kχ+

,    provide  the  foundation  for  our  investigation  of 

turbulence. These scalar variables have very nice properties. We emphasize four of these.  

First, our variables are unconstrained. This means that regardless of their values formula 

(2.2)  always  describes  a  real  solenoidal  vector  field.  Second,  the  variables  provide  a 

complete  representation  of  the  flow  field.  This  means  that  the  Navier  Stokes  equations 

can be expressed as a dynamical system in

 without using any modeling.  

(cid:71)
( )kχ−

(cid:71)
( )kχ+

and 

Third, the variables enter symmetrically in expressions for the energy, enstrophy, etc; see 

(2.3).  That  is  because  the  variables  are  designed  to  describe  the  left-right  symmetry 

native to Navier Stokes equations. Finally, our variables are directly associated with the 

notion of scale, namely in the Fourier sense: 

(cid:65)

.  In the light of these properties, 

(cid:71)
2 / kπ=

we can use 

(cid:71)
( )kχ−

and 

(cid:71)
( )kχ+

 for practically anything, including a statistical description 

(cid:71)
of turbulence.   Focusing specifically on isotropic turbulence, we know that all  k

 with 

the  same  magnitude  are  the  statistically  equivalent.  At  each  scale,

(cid:65)

(cid:71)
2 / kπ=

,  the 

collection of all  (

χ χ−
,

+ therefore generates a two dimensional pdf.  Thinking in terms of 
)

dynamical systems, this pdf gives a statistical description of that attractor in phase space 

 

 

13

which  represents  equilibrium  turbulence.    Within  this  description,    χ−   and χ+   serve  as 

two  random  variables.  To  emphasize  the  Cartesian  nature  expressed  by  (2.3)  we  call 

these  two  random  variables  X   and  Y .  Considering  an  ensemble  of  realizations  of  the 

same turbulent flow we let

suffices. 

 would then be a random vector on the shell

Before we examine the question of possible self-similarity in (cid:65) , let us consider the shape 

of a prototypical axisymmetric pdf.  It is described by its radial profile 

0P  as illustrated 

schematically in Figure 3a. The profile has some generic properties. In particular, 

0P  is 

never  negative,  and 0( , )

P r →(cid:65)

0

  as  r → ∞ .    The  value  at  the  origin, 

P
0(0, )

(cid:65) ,  is  of 

interest.  We have three possibilities: 

P
0(0, )

(cid:65) could vanish, it might not exist, or it could 

be  positive  and  finite.    Figure  3a  illustrates  the  last  possibility.  It  is  the  simplest 

possibility and also the one selected by all our data.  To describe the profile in Figure 3a, 

we need two parameters: size and steepness.  A measure for the size is the radius 

halfR of 

0J  at half the peak value. The steepness we can obtain from the derivative of 

0P  at 

halfR . 

From the steepness we get the width W of the transition region in 0J ; see Figure 3a.  Both 

halfR and W may vary with  (cid:65) .   If the ratio 

W R is independent of  (cid:65)  we have statistical 

/

half

self-similarity.    

Next,  let  us  consider  how  pdf’s  are  usually  rescaled.  A  semi-infinite  axis,  e.g., 

r ≥ , 
0

needs a unit. Likewise, a full axis with given origin needs a unit.  Working with pdf ‘s, 

that unit is usually obtained from the second order moment. For example, in the literature 

1/ 2

2

(
vδ (cid:38)

)

is used to normalize the pdf for  vδ (cid:38) .   The random variable  vδ (cid:38)  is designed so 

that

vδ ≡(cid:38)

0

. Thus, even though that random variable can take any real value, the origin 

on the axis is already given.  In general, however, the origin is not given on the full axis, 

but must be chosen.  Thus, for the full axis we need to select both an origin  μand a unit 

15

0σ > .  Mean and standard deviation are the standard choices in statistics.   If we change 

origin  and  unit  on  an  axis,  we  perform  a  coordinate  transformation  called  an  affinity.    

Invariance  after  an  appropriate  affinity  is  affine  symmetry.    It  is  common  in  statistics.   

For  example,  affine  symmetry  occurs  when  multiple  pdf’s  collapse  onto  a  single  graph 

after  being  plotted  using  mean  and  standard  deviation  for  respectively  centering  and 

scaling.  In the special case where the mean vanishes, the affine symmetry reduces to a 

simple rescaling and the symmetry is just “statistical self-similarity” (i.e., K41-scaling). 

 

 

The obvious question is now whether we can expect affine symmetry in our turbulence 

statistics.  If we have such symmetry,  then we shall say that the turbulence has normal 

scaling.  On the semi-infinite r-axis (

r ≥ ), we need 

0

0μ=  for the affinity to map the 

semi-infinite axis onto itself.   As discussed in connection with Figure 3a, the description 

of a monopole calls for two parameters, not just one.  To have both  μand  σ free, we 

need a full axis. That is, we must map 

r ≥  onto a full axis, say the  Ω − axis, with a non-

0

linear transform.  A logarithmic axis comes to mind, i.e.,

In  Appendix  I,  we  show  that  there  are  no  other  meaningful  choices  for 

( )rΩ besides 

logarithmic  functions.    Figure  3b  illustrates  our  prototypical  monopole  profile  on  a 

logarithmic  axis.  We  notice  immediately  that  mean  and  variance  do  not  exist  after  the 

transformation. However, it is also clear that obvious choices exist for both  μandσ. For 

example, we could think of the radius 

halfR  as mapped to  μ and  W to σ.  There are no 

constraints on  μandσ, other than

0σ > .   The place to look for affine symmetry is thus 

on the  Ω − axis.  The motivation for looking for symmetry is the old idea that the physics 

16

should be independent of scale in the inertial range.  That was the idea behind K41.  We 

are  trying  that  idea  again  with  our  new  statistical  variables  together  with  the  Fourier 

notion  of  scale.      Because  our  statistical  variables  are  readily  accessible  in  both  shell 

model  and  DNS  data,  we  can  formulate  a  symmetry  hypothesis  and  test  it.  Later  we 

analyze its theoretical implications.   The hypothesis reads: 

H1:

that μand σ are defined as in Figure 3b.  (2.7) determines 

( )C (cid:65) . 

H1 is the key. Let us describe how H1 fares with computational data. We describe both 

shell  model  data  and  DNS  data.    H1  first  emerged  as  an  observation  in  high  Reynolds 

number  shell  model  data.    The  specific  shell  model  we  used  was  Zimin’s  model 

(Melander & Fabijonas 2001, 2003, Hussain and Zimin 1995). This model has two real 

variables  similar  to  χ+ and  χ−   per  shell  (i.e.,  per  scale).    The  shell  model  was  forced 

steadily at the largest scale and run into equilibrium 250,000 times to generate a solution 

ensemble  at 

Rλ

×(cid:17)

3 10

6

.    The  statistical  analysis  of  that  ensemble  follows  exactly  the 

framework  laid  out  above  and  allows 

oP r (cid:65) to  be  constructed.  The  appropriate 

( ; )

17

 

 

 

 

technique for doing that is to sample the random variable 

(
ln X

2

2

Y+

)

and construct its 

pdf through kernel density estimation; see Silverman (1990).  From that pdf  our radial 

profile 

oP r (cid:65) can  be  calculated.  The  result  is  Figure  4a,  where 

( , )

oP r (cid:65) is  plotted  on  a 

( , )

double logarithmic chart for various (cid:65) .  On the logarithmic chart (2.10) implies that the 

graphs collapse to one when the abscissa is stretched appropriately (i.e., by 

( )σ (cid:65) )   and 

the graphs then moved rigidly to the same location (i.e., shifts by 

( )μ (cid:65)  and ln ( )C (cid:65) ). The 

collapse is shown on the top in magnified form.   For DNS data (

Rλ (cid:17)

the

512 dataset obtained from LANL.  Importantly, the data collapses in the same way as for 

the shell model (although to a different curve).   Hence, H1 is backed by both shell model 

and DNS data.    

Finally, we consider the axisymmetric structure functions for J . Because the area element 

in  polar  coordinates  is  rdrdθ  we  define  the  structure  function  of  order  p  as  the

With this definition we can state our second assumption.  

 

 

 

18

H2:  All  convergent  structure  functions 

pS (cid:65) are  power  laws  in (cid:65)   within  the  inertial 

( )

range.   

The assumption of power laws is classical in the literature on inertial range statistics and 

is backed by a substantial body of evidence of both experimental (e.g., Benzi et al 1995), 

computational (e.g., Boratav & Pelz 1997), and theoretical nature (Lundgren 2003).  The 

literature, however, deals with the classical variables (δ(cid:38)  and δ⊥ ), not our new variables 

( χ+ and  χ− ).  Thus,  we  supply  computational  data  to  substantiate  H2  for  our  variables. 

The shell model data has a wide inertial range where power laws are evident; see Figure 

5a. For the DNS data, the inertial range is much shorter because the Reynolds number is 

much lower. The standard technique is then ESS (see Benzi, et al 1995) which includes 

data  from  the  dissipation  range.  ESS  plots 

pS (cid:65)   against 

( )

3S (cid:65) ,  instead  of  (cid:65) ,  on  a

double  logarithmic  chart.    The  resulting  graphs  should  then  be  straight  lines.  They  are; 

see Figure 5b.

pζ is the scaling exponent,  

pC the scaling coefficient, and o(cid:65) is a reference length. 

We  could  absorb  the  factor

ζ−(cid:65)

p

o

into  the  constant

pC   without  changing 

pS .  This  fact 

merely  shows  that  there  is  interdependence  between  the  reference  length  and  scaling 

coefficient.  Once we specify 

o(cid:65)  the power laws (2.12) uniquely determine pC .  We will 

carry 

o(cid:65)  in our calculations as arbitrary until a natural length scale emerges.

With  our  data  supporting  H1  and  H2,  we  study  the  Navier  Stokes  turbulence  in  lieu  of 

these  two  assumptions.  This  is  our  link  to  the  Navier  Stokes  equations.  The  interesting 

question is this: How restrictive is the combination of H1 and H2? The simple answer is: 

very restrictive; 

oP r (cid:65) must belong to a very small class of functions.  The next three 

( ; )

sections  comprise  a  mathematical  analysis  to  that  effect.  We  find  formulas  for  the 

structure functions and the underlying pdf. These formulas are all listed in the beginning 

of Section 6. 

3. Deriving of the functional equation 

The  appropriate  tool  for  analyzing  the  consequences  of  H1  and  H2  is  the  Mellin 

transform:

This  transform  deals  with  moments  of  a  function  defined  on  the  positive  real  axis.    If 

known, 

( )zΦ provides all moments of 

( )rφ  – integer as well as fractional orders.  Like 

the inverse Laplace transform,  the inverse Mellin transform is a contour integral in the 

complex plane:

The Mellin transform is related to both the Fourier and Laplace transforms; see Sneddon 

(1995) p. 41. In fact, operational rules for those transforms have Mellin counterparts. In 

particular, we need the rule:

The latter definition is permissible because 

pC is positive. This follows from (2.12) and 

the observation that

P r (cid:65)  is not negative and therefore has positive moments (3.4). By

The next step will apply the logarithm to both sides of (3.14), so we define

This definition is permissible because

 as can be seen from (3.8) by noting that  

,σ C  and 

pS (cid:65)  are all positive.  After taken the logarithm, (3.14) translates to

This equation is trivial if

which  has  no  intermittency.  Equation  (3.19)  gives  no  information  in  that  case. 

Specifically, we do not obtain an expression for

(

Without

We  can  assume

Equation (3.21) is a functional equation for the unknown functions (

)wη , (

s w A p  and

)

)B p in terms of the independent variables  p and w .  The equation is the mathematical 

(

consequence of assuming nonlinear scaling exponents (

H1.    The  equation  is  our  governing  equation  for  intermittency.    In  the  case  of  K41 

scaling, which is equivalent to statistical self-similarity and no intermittence, the equation 

is trivially satisfied.

Under the provision of sufficient smoothness (

complete  solution 

to  (3.21) 

in  closed  form.  The  smoothness  conditions  are 

inconsequential for our physical problem, but mathematically they exclude “pathological 

solutions.”  Our method for solving equation (3.21) consists of transforming it into one 

whose  solution  is  known.  This  process  requires  us  to  introduce  yet  more  functions  and 

variables, but the effort pays off with the certainty of knowing the complete solution.  In 

contrast,  one  can  also  obtain  solutions  by  inspection  (e.g.,  η  being  a  power  or  a 

logarithm solves 3.21), but then the question of completeness remains open.  Our task in 

this section is thus to find 

)wη , (

s w A p  and

)B p  in closed form.

The solution to this functional equation consists of those functions 

,L R  and 
1

2R for which 

(4.6) is satisfied for all positive x and y.  As the reader may imagine, (4.6) can be found in 

the literature on functional equations. In fact, (4.6) is one of Pexider’s equations which in 

turn  is  a  generalization  of  Cauchy’s  equation (

Using our notation, Theorem 4 page 144 in Aczel (1966) states: “The general solutions, 

with  L continuous at a point, of (4.6) are

  (

t >

                             (4.7) 

supplemented by the trivial solutions.”  Here 

a b β are arbitrary constants. In (4.7), we 

,

,

write the exponent as 

1β− , rather thanβ,  so as to streamline the subsequent analysis.  

Evidently, we can transfer a constant factor from 

1R  to 

2R  without changing L . Thus, a 

25

redundancy exists between constants  a and  b  (i.e., only their product enters into L .) We 

will  remove  this  redundancy  when  we  develop  expressions  for 

)wη , (

s w A p  
)

),

(

(

and (

)B p .  

Let us deal with the trivial solutions to (4.6) first. They are respectively (

L t

2( )R t  arbitrary) and (

because (4.5), (3.22) and (3.20) yield 

σ =

. Thus, the trivial solutions all correspond 

to  K41-scaling  for  which  our  analysis  yields  nothing.  The  trivial  solutions  to  (4.6)  are 

therefore irrelevant.  

The next task is to translate the solution (4.7) into expressions for 

)A p ,
(

)B p , (

s w  and 
)

In solving these equations, two special cases,

(cid:65)  and hence 

w σ≡

(cid:65) , i.e., (3.20) and (3.22), but the influence is

only the through the combined constant

0

ln o

(cid:65) .   We can trace the dependence on 

0s  

all  the  way  back  to  the  expression  for  the  moments

pS (cid:65) .    By  doing  so,  we  find  that 

( )

pS (cid:65)  is independent of 

( )

0s .  Moreover, we recognize that 

0s  exists because 

pC  depends 

on the reference scale for  (cid:65) ; see the discussion below (2.12).  Previously, we introduced 

that reference scale as 

o(cid:65) , but left it otherwise unspecified.  Now, we have arrived at the 

point where we can choose 

o(cid:65)  to be an intrinsic length scale for the inertial range scaling 

regime.  This  choice  of 

o(cid:65)   emerges  by  choosing   

s =   so  that  the  right  hand  side  in 
0

0

(4.17) contain no component of (4.14). This choice results in the simplest expression for 

pC , i.e., one that is not polluted by a factor  (

const ζ . We shall also see below that

) p

o(cid:65) , 

thus chosen, marks the infrared termination of the scaling regime.

The  right  hand  side  must  be  positive  to  assure  a  positive  single  valued  solution  σ.    In 

studying small scales, 

(cid:65) , we must therefore require

0bβ < . (In studying an infrared 

/

o<(cid:65)

cascade one would make the opposite choice. This would be the situation if one were to 

study scales larger than the forcing scale - like in the cascade from small to large scales 

advocated by C. Gibson (1996).) We remove the redundancy between  a and  b in (4.7) by 

                                           b β= − .                                                                              (4.21) 

It is the same redundancy that exists between  f  and σ in (2.10).  With that redundancy 

taking

Here,  ln o(cid:65)  marks the virtual origin for the inertial range scaling laws. The scaling laws 

can  not  be  continued  to  scales  larger  than o(cid:65) .    Thus,  our o(cid:65)   is  truly  an  intrinsic  length 

scale for the inertial range unlike the integral scale used in K41.

In this section, we analyze the two expressions (5.1) and (5.2). (Appendix II contains the 

corresponding analysis for the special cases

0,1β =

.) There are several important issues 

 

 

30

with  which  we  must  deal.    Starting  with  the  inversion  process,  the  inverse  Mellin 

transform must exist and produce a real function (i.e., zero imaginary part).  That is, the 

integral  (3.2)  must  converge  to  a  real  value  for  all 

r ≥ .  That  imposes  a  selection 

0

criterion  on 

the  parameters

  Except

a 

few 

exceptional 

cases

β =

,  the  literature  does  not  provide  the  inverse  transform  (5.2).  

Consequently, we must introduce a new class of special functions. To analyze asymptotic 

behavior  and  construct  numerical  algorithms  for  these  functions,  we  reduce  them  to  a 

normal  form  free  of  removable  constants.  Another  important  issue  is  the  value  of  the 

constant 

1c ,  we shall see that it determines the behavior of 

( )g r in the limit of small r.  

As is evident from (3.16) and (4.19),  1c  affects the scaling coefficient 

pC , but the scaling 

exponent 

pζ  is independent of  1c ; see (3.15) and (4.18).  Analysis of the other azimuthal 

modes  in  (2.5)  leads  to  same  functional  equation  (3.21)  and  therefore  to  the  same 

formulas for 

pζ  and 

pC . However, the value of  1c  will differ between various azimuthal 

modes in (2.5). Since  1c  does not enter in the expression for the scaling exponent 

pζ , all 

azimuthal  modes  can  have  common  scaling  exponents.  That  allows  the  joint  pdf    J  to 

have scaling laws. Here, we show that 

c =  for the axisymmetric mode in (2.5).  The 
1 1

final issue is whether  

oJ ,  as constructed from 

( )g r  via (2.6) and (3.6),  is actually a pdf.  

Because

oS

=(cid:65)
( ) 1

is  already  arranged  by  (3.9), 

oJ   is  a  pdf  if  and  only  if 

g r ≥ .  This 

( ) 0

condition further restricts the parameterβ.

5.1 Existence of the inverse Mellin transform and its normal form.

( )g r  from (5.2).

zβ   is  multi-valued  except  at 

z = .  Thus,  we  have  to  introduce  a  branch  cut  emerging 

0

from 

z = . We place this cut along the negative real axis and select θas the principal 

0

argument of z: 

                                                 π θ π

− < < .                                                                    (5.4) 

Then it follows from (5.3) that 

G z

=

G z

. We also have

r

special functions. Using them, we recover 

( )g r  and the pdf for the inertial range.  

5.2 Determining the value of  1c .  

Consider the azimuthal expansion (2.5) in the limit of small r.  If J has to be smooth at 

r =   then 

0

P P

  must  all  vanish  there.  The  value  of  J  at  the  origin  is  therefore 

determined  solely  by  the  axisymmetric  term 

0P .  It  has  a  finite  positive  value  precisely 

when (0)g

, and hence  (0)b

, does; see (3.6) and (5.13) respectively. Thus, we require that 

( )rb

  has  a  limit  as

r

5.3 Non-negative b(r).  

Our  last  requirement  is  that 

( )g r   is  non-negative  so  that 

0J   is  a  pdf.  On  account  of 

(5.13), 

( )g r  and 

( )rb

 have the same sign. Using the result (5.20), 

( )rb

depends only on 

one parameter:  β; see (5.10) and (5.11).  Because of the requirement 

r ≥
( ) 0

, we must 

b

reject those values of  βfor which ( )rb

takes negative values.  Below we analyze the sign 

of ( )rb

.  The  analysis  splits  into  many  separate  cases.  Before  looking  into  these 

technicalities,  let  summarize  the  results  of  the  analysis.      We  show  analytically  that 

b

r ≥
( ) 0

 when  0

2β<

≤ . We also demonstrate analytically that  ( ) 0

r ≥

 when  2

3β<
<  

b

and 

1r ≥ , but we must rely on numerical techniques for 

1r < .  For largerβ,  ( )rb

 either 

does not exist (i.e., for  3

5β≤

≤ , 7

9β≤

≤ , …) or numerical calculations show 

( )rb

 to 

be  an  oscillatory  function  with  both  positive  and  negative  values  (i.e.,  for 

5

7β<

< , 9

11β<
<

,  …).    Moreover,  Appendix  II  rules  out 

0β = ,  but  allows 

1β = .   

Thus, we have  ( )rb

non-negative precisely when 0

3β<

< . The corresponding graphs are 

shown Figure 6.

Because 

β

z

β βθρ=
e

i

  is  an  oscillatory  function  of  θ,  the  behavior  of  the  integrand 

becomes  increasingly  more  complicated  as  β  increases.    Our  analysis  therefore  splits 

into several separate cases according to the sign of  ln r  and the value ofβ.   

5.3.1 Case  0

1β<

1r > . 

Using

ρ θ

r

   .                                 (5.22) 

The last term dominates when  ρ is large. Thus, (5.22) tends to minus infinity asρ→ ∞  

when  cos

0θ> . Consequently, the integrand in (5.21) decays faster than algebraically in 

the  right  half  plane.  With  the  only  singularity  located  at  the  origin  and  the  branch  cut 

running along the negative real axis, the integrand is analytic in the right half plane. Thus, 

we  can  close  the  integration  loop  (5.21)  with  a  large  semicircle  to  the  right  and  use 

Cauchy integral theorem to show that (5.21) vanishes identically.  Thus, we have 

                            ( )

r ≡

0,

b

  0

1β<

<  and 

1r > .                                                        (5.23) 

This means compact support for  ( )rb

.  

5.3.2 Case  0

1β<

<  and 

1r < . 

With  ln r  negative, the integrand in (5.21) decays faster than algebraically only in the left 

half plane; see (5.22).  So we can not close the integration loop with a right semicircle. 

Instead, we consider the curve  defined by 

                               Im(

Along this curve the integrand in (5.21) does not oscillate. Rewriting (5.24) we obtain the

The right hand side of (5.25) is positive for  π θ π

asθ π→ ± . Thus,  S consists of a single arc that runs of to infinity in both directions as 

illustrated in Figure 7a. Since  S runs to infinity in the left half plane, we can deform the 

integration path in (5.21) to  S .  It is thus possible to express  ( )rb

 as an integral over θ.

That  gives  us

and 

/π β θ π< < .  

Correspondingly,  we  have  two  arcs  in  the  complex  plane.  One  arc  has 

/θ π β=

asymptote and runs from infinity to zero. The other also connects zero to infinity, but has 

θ π β

 as its asymptote. To avoid the branch cut, we join the two arcs with a circular 

loop around zero to form a single curveS ; see Figure 7c. With increasing θ, we traverse  

both arcs from top to bottom. We must reverse this orientation before we can deform the 

integration  path  in  (5.21)  to  S .  The  deformation  is  permissible  because  the  integrand

6. Summary, Discussion and Conclusion  

We  have  observed  affine  symmetry 

in  computational  data  and  formulated  a 

corresponding   hypothesis (H1) for the inertial range.  Combining H1 with the traditional 

assumption (H2) of scaling laws for the structure functions, we obtain a potent analytical 

setup.  A very limited class of statistics satisfies both H1 and H2. We found this class by 

analytic  means  in  Sections  3-5.  Except  for  a  few  undetermined  constants,  we 

consequently  know  scaling  exponents  and  coefficients  for  all  structure  functions  of  the 

random variable

.  Moreover, we envision that Navier Stokes equations lead to equations for 

a  and  β.  The mathematics behind this vision is only sketchy at this time and may not 

come  to  fruition,  but  if  it  eventually  does  then  there  should  be  no  undetermined 

parameters  left,  only  the  unavoidable  normalizations 

o(cid:65)   and  ε.    These  are  intrinsic 

44

normalizations for the inertial range: 

o(cid:65)  is the infrared virtual origin, and ε is the energy 

flux. That such a complete analysis without modeling is  possible hinges on H1 and H2 

being  true  symmetry  properties  for  equilibrium  turbulence  in  limit  of  high  Reynolds 

numbers.  

Our theoretical attack on the intermittency problem uses a non-traditional set of variables 

to formulate symmetry. Let us discuss why the choice of variables matters. A good place 

to start is to quote Frisch (1990, p xi) who wrote: “Modern work on turbulence focuses to 

a large extent on trying to understand the reasons for the partial failure of the 1941 theory 

(K41).”    Our  analysis  offers  a  constructive  resolution  of  this  issue.    The  spirit  of  K41 

calls  for  a  global  scaling  invariance  (i.e.,  symmetry)  in  the  inertial  range  because  the 

physics is the same at all scales, namely inertia.  That idea comes to fruition in our work, 

but it requires that turbulence be described in a suitable framework. That is, we need an 

appropriate set of basis functions and corresponding variables. Only then does symmetry 

become apparent. K41 thus goes astray technically through its choice of variables.  There 

are two problems with the variables used by K41. First, they define scale inconsistently 

with  the  idea  of  global  scaling  invariance.  Second,  they  represent  a  one  dimensional 

Cartesian  projection  of  a  two  dimensional  pdf  that  should  be  described  in  polar 

coordinates. Let us discuss these two problems in turn. 

First, in the tradition of the Karman-Howarth equation for homogeneous turbulence, K41 

follows the common practice of using velocity increments in physical space, i.e., 

vδ (cid:38) (cid:65)  
( )

or 

vδ ⊥ (cid:65) .  These  can  be  measured  experimentally.  Corresponding  to  probes  at  two 

( )

 

 

 

45

points,  P  and  Q,  the  implied  definition  of  scale  is 

(cid:65)

.  By  finding  velocity 

(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:71)
PQ=

(cid:71)
increments  we  filter  u

. 

  Unfortunately,  the  filter  has  poor  three  dimensional 

(cid:71)
characteristics. This fact becomes clear when we think a plane wave with wave vector  k

. 

(cid:71)
The filter considers only the component of  k

(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:71)
 along PQ

. So a low frequency filter (i.e., 

large 

(cid:65)

(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:71)
PQ=

)  picks up high frequency waves as illustrated in Figure 8. The implication 

is well known for the energy spectrum in isotropic turbulence; see Hinze (1987, p 209). 

In fact, there is a way to convert the one dimensional energy spectrum 

1E k  obtained 

1

)

(

from PQ-probe into a three dimensional spectrum 

. The energy spectra arise from 

(cid:71)
(
E k

)

second  order  structure  functions  and  afore  mentioned  conversion  formula  is  special  to 

that case. For structure functions of arbitrary order, we lack corresponding formulas. It is 

important  to  understand  that  this  whole  issue  disappears  when  we  operate  in  Fourier 

space  from  the  very  beginning  for  it  is  well  known  from  the  wavelet  literature  that 

Fourier space provides the ideal separation into scales; e.g., Strang and Nguyen (1996).     

 

 

Second, even when the variables are defined in Fourier space, the symmetry is still not 

obvious.  Shell models illustrate this point.  For example, the popular shell model “GOY” 

has  been  studied  extensive  because  it  exhibits  anomalous  scaling  and  inertial  range 

intermittency  in  a  simpler  setting  than  the  Navier  Stokes  equations  (e.g.,  Frisch  1990  p 

176,  Jensen  et  al    1994  ,  Biferale    2003).  Like  Zimin’s  model,  GOY  has  two  real 

variables in each shell. Conceptually, we have the same situation for both the shell model 

and the Navier Stokes in  (

χ χ−
,

+ -variables. That is, a two dimensional pdf describes the 
)

shell statistics. Its natural description is through azimuthal modes (2.5), where the mean 

46

radial profile 

P r (cid:65)  is the primary focus.  As described in Section 2,  
0( , )

P r (cid:65)  can scale 
0( , )

nicely through affine symmetry in the logarithmic coordinate 

Ω =

ln r

.  It is as simple as 

resetting  the  origin  and  the  unit  on  the  Ω − axis  (see  Figures  3  and  4).    The  usual 

statistics, gathered when working with shell models, include the pdf’s for the amplitude 

(

(

−
χ

2

)

+

(

+
χ

2

)

)1/ 2

 together with individual components   χ−  and  χ+ .   Those statistics 

hide  our  affine  symmetry.    In  particular,  we  see  only  the  usual  intermittency  and 

anomalous scaling in the pdf ‘s for  χ−  and  χ+ .  That is, they look similar to the pdf for 

vδ (cid:38) ; see figure 2b and Biferale (2003 p 448).   By way of an analytic example, Melander 

and  Fabijonas  (2006)  illustrated  how  the  pdf’s  for  χ−   and  χ+   can  hide  our  affine 

symmetry.      In  that  example,  we  used  the  explicit  inverse  Mellin  transform  for

2β = to 

avoid  the  technicalities  of  Sections  3-5.    Our  example  was  constructed  from  affine 

symmetry so as to have scaling exponents matching those in Kolmogorov (1962) yet the 

pdf ‘s for  χ−  and  χ+ looked like those for the usual velocity increments.   That analytic 

example  makes  the  point  that  intermittency  and  self-similarity  can  coexist.  However, 

neither collapse in Figure 4 corresponds to

2β = .  So 

2β = is not the value selected by 

Navier Stokes’ or Zimin’s shell model.  

The  benefit  of  using  good  variables  is  that  the  underlying  symmetry  becomes  apparent 

and  the  analysis  manageable.  On  the  basis  of  the  good  variables  we  have  formulated  a 

broad  new  framework  for  analyzing  turbulence.  With  appropriate  modifications  the 

framework can be applied in related situations, e.g., 2D-turbulence, passive scalars, and 

infrared cascades.  We must, however, point out one important caveat. That is, other than 

 

 

47

intermittency  and  anomalous  scaling,  we  have  little  to  compare  directly  with  the 

traditional approach based on velocity increments.  Presently, no direct comparison with 

experimental data is possible. One could have hoped that at our scaling exponents would 

match 

pζ(cid:38)

  or 

pζ⊥ ,  but  the  DNS  data  shows  that  they  do  not.    Thus,  presently,  we  can 

only compare our theoretical results with DNS data processed according to our formulas.  

Elsewhere,  we  will  report  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  present  data,  including  the 

techniques  for  finding  the  constants.  The  thrust  of  this  paper  is  theoretical;  data  is 

included only to back up the hypothesis H1 and H2.

8. Appendix I 

Let  us  reconsider  the  choice  of  the  non-linear  transformation 

( )rΩ   in  H1.      While  a 

logarithmic  function  is  an  obvious  way  of  mapping  the  semi-infinite  axis  onto  the  full 

axis,  one  could  reasonably  ask  if  it  is  meaningful  to  use  another  function  in  H1.    The 

criterion as to what constitutes a meaningful 

( )rΩ  will have to be that the transformation 

must  not  ruin  statistical  self-similarity  (K41-scaling)  by  mapping  it  onto  something  not 

self similar in ( )rΩ .  That is, if  

P r (cid:65)  possesses K41-scaling using the r-variable then 
0( ; )

 

50

it  should  also  scale  normally  in 

( )rΩ .    With  that  restriction,  we  will  show  that  only 

logarithmic functions can be used as 

( )rΩ  in H1.   

Our constraint that a function 

F r (cid:65)  obeying self-statistical similarity should also scale 

( , )

normally in  Ω  requires that we simultaneously have

Now we pick an arbitrary constant  C  in the range of s and let  C(cid:65)  denote the solution to  

s

C=(cid:65)
( )

.  Substituting   C(cid:65)  and

Equation  (8.6)  states  that  Ω   maps  self-statistical  similarity  to  normal  scaling.    At  least 

locally, 

1μ  is an invertible function of  (cid:65) . Thus,  1s  and 

1σ  are implicit functions of 

1μ ,  

i.e.,  1

which is a functional equation for

a monotone function so the corollary on page 150 applies. It states that (8.10) has exactly 

two solution systems:

not use the latter two equations in (8.12) because they only apply when there is statistical

Because  of  the  last  factor  in  (9.4),  we  can  only  have  a  finite  non-zero  limit  as

ab = .  From  the  first  factor,  we  see  that  the  same  requirement

c = .   However, 
1 1

ab = gives us one of the trivial solutions to (3.21) and thus

yields 

Special case 

1β =  

This special case follows the main case through (4.17), so the formulae for both

a =  is not an option, because that results in a trivial

0θ< asymptotically.      The  integrand  in  (9.10)  thus  decays 

faster than algebraically; consequently, we can deform the integration path to  S . Using 

the fact that

1 INTRODUCTION.

Excitation  circuits  are  required  for  active  sensors,  i.e.  sensors  that  do  not  directly  produce  an
electric signal proportional to the measured physical quantity. Active sensors are characterized by
the property that the measured physical quantity modulates an electrical parameter of the sensor.
Among them are: temperature sensors, pressure sensors, position sensors, acceleration sensors and
many other [1].
The  measurement  of  the  useful  electrical  parameter  of  the  sensor  is  usually  performed  by  the
combination of  an excitation circuit and a  readout circuit. The sensor can be excited by  a current
and  a  voltage  is  therefore  measured,  or  the  sensor  can  be  excited  by  a  voltage  and  a  current  is
measured.
In  addition  to  direct  impedance  measurement,  many  other  more  sophisticated  techniques,  which
might involve also time and frequency, are indeed based on these two fundamental methods.
Current and voltage generators are therefore critical items in sensor electronics and their  accuracy
always appears as a design goal in the development of sensor subsystems.
Speaking of voltage sources, both AC and DC, we see that the overall accuracy is usually dependent
on  few  elements  of  the  excitation  circuit,  essentially  voltage  references  and  voltage  dividing
networks.
In voltage driven sensors, usually there is no technical difficulty that prevents the application of the
exact excitation to the sensor as it appears on the voltage reference.  A four-wire voltage feedback
excitation  circuit  can  readily  compensate  the  voltage  drop  due  to  the  connecting  wires.  Other

1

disturbances  such  as  magnetic  induction,  thermoelectric  effects,  photoelectric  effects,  can  be
shielded, easily compensated or filtered out.
Differently, for current sources an intrinsic difficulty may arise from the fact that even if the source
can produce a precise AC or DC current, it is difficult to convey the current to the sensor without
dispersion.
Similarly to the voltage excitation, the current in the vicinity of the sensor can be readily measured
and controlled, but it is sometimes physically impossible to separate the current that is useful for the
measurement from the current flowing in parasitic impedances.
Evidence of this behavior might come, for instance, from the front sensing capacitive displacement
sensor.  In  this  class  of  sensors,  the  measurement  current  flows  in  one  side  of  the  armature,  the
dispersion  current  flows  in  the  other  side  of  the  same  armature  towards  the  environment.
Bootstrapped shielding electrodes or guard rings can mitigate the effect but no exact compensation
can be made without a properly designed circuit.
The  possibility  of  controlling  the  exact  current  flowing  in  a  device,  compensating  for  parasitic
effects,  may  also  find  application  in  actuator  driving  circuits.  Current  driven  actuators  are  indeed
affected by current partition between the varying actuator impedance and the parasitic impedances.
The ability of compensating for parasitic currents may maximize the accuracy of the actuation.
This  paper  describes  a  simple  circuit  capable  of  generating  an  almost  constant  and  controllable
AC/DC  excitation  current  in  a  varying  transducer  impedance,  even  if  a  known  and  invariant
parasitic impedance is connected in parallel to the effective transducer impedance.
Analytical solutions are computed for the simplest case, whilst SPICE simulations are employed for
the numerical analysis of a more realistic application.
Because of the inherent simplicity of the circuit and of its electrical components, SPICE simulations
are indeed appropriate for demonstrating the validity of the technique [2], nonetheless a breadboard
proof of concept circuit has been built, mainly for overall stability testing.

2 THE COMPENSATED CURRENT INJECTION CIRCUIT.

The Compensated Current Injection (CCI) circuit is shown in figure 1.
The  electric  network  is  composed  by  the  effective  sensor  (actuator)  impedance  ZS,  the  global
parasitic  impedance  ZP,  three  additional  impedances  Z1,  Z2,  Z3,  an  instrumentation  differential
amplifier with a gain of 1 and an operational amplifier with gain Ao.
In  the  analysis  ZP  represents  the  parallel  of  all  the  parasitic  impedances  of  the  sensor  (actuator),
wiring, amplifier input impedance and bias resistors. Z3 represents the parallel of a discrete passive
electric network, the amplifier input impedance and bias resistors.

The transfer function of the CCI circuit can be calculated with result:

The expression has been written in a form that puts in evidence the open loop transfer function of
the operational amplifier Ao and the effective sensor (actuator) impedance ZS.
By inspecting equation (1) a balance condition can be easily identified by choosing:

The balance condition can be satisfied by means of direct measurement or analytical prediction of
the different impedances therein, except at least one, which must be imposed using equation 2. At
least one of the impedances in equation 2 must be adjustable for fine tuning. The procedure of fine
tuning  is  similar  to  bridge  balancing,  but  the  physical  quantity  measured  during  the  balancing
procedure is application dependent, this point will be discussed in paragraph 4.

The transconductance YT∞ in equation (4) does not depend on ZS as required.
Equations (2) and (4) characterize the behavior of the CCI circuit for applications.
In a practical standpoint the balance condition (equation 2) can be satisfied with the highest possible
accuracy,  but  Ao  cannot  usually  exhibit  a  modulus  much  higher  than  106,  therefore  equation  3
should be employed for the exact calculation of the transimpedance of a balanced CCI circuit. The
complexity of  equation 3  and  the  fact  that  Ao  is  usually  a  transfer  function  suggests  a  simulation
approach if an accurate analysis must be carried on a realistic CCI circuit.
The output impedance, which includes the parasitic impedance  ZP, can be  computed by removing
ZS, then choosing VIN=0 and calculating the voltage VZP across ZP due to a now external current
 –IS. The output impedance is therefore:

As  a  final  remark,  it  must  be  stressed  that  the  CCI  circuit  is  characterized  by  a  positive  and  a
negative feedback through separate electric networks. In a balanced circuit, stability is ensured by a
finite  load  impedance  ZS  .  An  open  circuit  load,  associated  to  overcompensation  might  push  the
circuit to the limit of an intrinsic instability.

3 NOISE ANALYSIS.

There  are  numerous  possible  noise  source  in  the  CCI  circuit,  and  some  of  them  are  not  uniquely
defined in the transfer function analysis because impedances Zi are somehow arbitrary. A complete
noise  analysis  can  be  easily  performed  after  the  definition  of  the  circuit  impedances,  and  the
analysis  could  be  performed  either  analytically  or  numerically  with  simulation  softwares  like
SPICE.
The exact expression of the output noise of the  circuit  is here calculated  assuming impedances Zi
pure reactances. The presented analysis is adequate for the application example of paragraph 4.
We first analyze the effect of the voltage noise of the amplifiers.
By simple inspection and taking into account that the instrumentation amplifier has a gain of one,
the  output  current  noise  density  due  to  the  voltage  noise  of  the  amplifiers  is  easily  expressed  in
terms of the CCI circuit transfer function:

 

W

where  WIen  is  the  current  noise  spectral  density  in  impedance  ZS  due  to  the  voltage  noise  of  the
amplifiers,  YT is the CCI circuit transfer function, WenIns is the voltage noise spectral density of the
instrumentation  amplifier  and  ,  WenOPAMP  is  the  voltage  noise  spectral  density  of  the  operational
amplifier.
The effects of the current noise generators in the istrumentation amplifier are analyzed by using the
expression of the impedances as seen by the inputs of the amplifier.
Input– sees the impedance Z -=ZO//ZS, which can be easily computed.
For a balanced CCI the impedance Z - is:

Using equation (9), taking the limit for 
and under a balance condition the impedance seen
by input – is therefore ZS. This is the worst case for a balanced circuit, in fact with a lower gain the
impedance  is  lower,  less  current  noise  is  sent  to  ZS  and  less  voltage  noise  can  be  computed  as
equivalent noise transferred to the input.

With  a  noise  current  injected  in  the  non  inverting  input  of  the  instrumentation  amplifier  a  noise

where WinIns is the current noise spectral density of the instrumentation amplifier with a gain of one.
The  current  noise  of  the  operational  amplifier  has  been  neglected  because  the  impedance  of  the
driving network is low, making the effect of the noise current negligible.
The current noise spectral densities named WinIns in equation 13 may also include, as an additional
term, the thermal noise of bias resistors. Bias resistors can be easily incorporated in ZP and Z3 for the
calculation of the transimpedance.
Under  the  already  discussed  limitations  of  the  analysis,  equations  11,  13  are  generally  useful
guidelines for choosing impedance Z1 and the constant C, which in turn determines Z2 and Z3.

4 APPLICATION EXAMPLE: THE PLANE CAPACITOR FORCE ACTUATOR.

The proposed application is the plane capacitor force actuator with parallel electrodes [3], driven by
the CCI circuit.
Using  sine  AC  current  IS  with  frequency  f=ω/2π,  the  average  attractive  force  between  the  two
electrodes with area S of the ideal plane capacitor having capacitance CS= ε S/x is:

where the electrical quantities V, IS are expressed in RMS values and, if x is a function of time,  ω
has to be much higher than the highest spectral component in x.
Equation 14 shows that if a controlled current drives this class of force actuators, the applied force
does  not  depend  on  the  distance  x.  An  additional  benefit  is  the  lack  of  electrostatically  induced
stiffness ∂F/∂x.

Figure  2  represents  a  CCI  circuit  connected  to  a  plane  capacitor  actuator,  characterized  by  a  thin
wire flexible connection. Both rear faces of the plane capacitor actuator, with active capacitance CS,
suffer  of  parasitic  coupling  to  the  environment.  For  the  presented  example  only  the  right  plate  is
affected by an effective capacitive parasitic coupling CP to ground potential. CP must be measured
with  the  highest  accuracy  and  must  be  time  invariant  for  the  proper  operation  of  the  circuit,  the
balancing procedure is described below.
An accurate measurement  of  the capacitance of CP is required for  the  design  of  the  CCI  network
and for the determination of IS as shown in equation 16.
Being CP and CS connected in parallel, the total capacitance can be measured twice, imposing two
different  values  of  the  distance  x,  which  geometrically  determines  CS.  Then  CP  can  be  easily
calculated.
Choosing the restrictive balance condition of equation 11, with C=1 we have:

C1= C2 and Cp=C3

the  exemplified  application, 

the  balancing  could  be  performed  by  measuring 

that does not depend on CS as required.
Being Ao not infinite, the driving CCI circuit does not exactly satisfy equations 2 and 4, the current
Is  is  not  independent  from  CS=  ε  S/x  and  therefore,  because  of  equation  14,  such  a  system  is
characterized by ∂F/∂x≠ 0. Nevertheless, for a balanced system, the higher Ao is, the lower |∂F/∂x|
becomes.
For 
the
electrostatically  induced  stiffness,  then  C3  could  be  tuned  in  order  to  minimize  the  stiffness  in
absolute value.
Methods  for  measuring  the  stiffness  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper  and  can  be  found  in
reference 4.
An  array  of  CCI  circuits  could  be  employed  for  the  electrostatic  actuation  of  single  test  mass,
multiple  electrode  accelerometers  with  many  degrees  of  freedom.  This  application  is  typical  for
space based instruments. Sometimes the test mass must be electrically insulated [5] and care should
be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  summation  of  the  currents  entering  the  test  mass  is  zero,  the  residual
current flows between the test mass and the frame supporting the active electrodes. For this class of
accelerometers the force acting on each active electrode and the test mass is well approximated by
equation 14.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION.

The  application  example  has  been  studied  with  SPICE  [6].  Figure  3  depicts  the  schematic  of  the
simulated CCI circuit.
For the simulated example of figure 3, the parasitic capacitance CP is 30 pF.  The sensor (actuator)
capacitance CS is stepped from 1 to 5 pF by steps of 1 pF. The chosen values are compatible with
those presented in references [3] and [4].
A generalization of the CCI equations is required for the analysis of this circuit. More precisely the
restriction  of  K=1  for  the  instrumentation  amplifier  must  be  removed,  because  in  the  example  of
figure  3  the  gain  K  of  the  instrumentation  amplifier  is  not  one  but  is  expressed  by  a  transfer
function.

The CCI circuit depicted in figure 3 is characterized by the use of three OPAMPs to build the well
know  instrumentation  amplifier  configuration.  Resistors  R3  and  R4=R5  have  been  employed  to
acquire useful gain from U1 and U2. It follows that K becomes the closed loop transfer function of
a non-inverting amplifier made with an OPAMP [7].
K contributes to the loop gain and improves the ability of the circuit to keep the current independent
from the changes of the capacitance of CS.
Two equal resistive dividing network (R6, R8 and R7, R9) reduce the loop gain in the positive and
negative feedback path by a half. This additional network is required because resistors R7 and R9
permit also the addition of  the input voltage  with  the  same  weighting  than  those  presented  to  the
outputs of U1 and U2.  Therefore, in this implementation, the open loop gain Ao is the open loop
gain of a LF411 divided by 2.
In addition, a high pass filter made  with C6 and  R11 has been  employed  to stabilize the working
point of U3 and a more realistic bias resistance of 10 MΩ is employed for R1 and R2.
A RC network composed by C7 and R10 has been  introduced  to  properly  shape the loop transfer
function for improving the stability margin.
The circuit does not require a global DC feedback loop for controlling the offset of the operational
amplifiers.  In fact the first stage  composed  by  U1 and  U2 has  a  DC gain  of 41, this voltage  gain
applies to the DC offset of U1 and U2. The second stage has unitary DC gain because of capacitor
C6. If required, an additional RC high pass filter with RC values equal to the couple R11 C6 could
be connected to the non-inverting input of U3 to minimize the overall offset voltage.
Using  these  values,  SPICE  simulation  yields  the  transfer  function  presented  in  figure  4.  In  the
simulations the input voltage is 1 V.
Between  100  kHz  and  1  MHz  the  loop  gain  is  insufficient,  and  this  implementation  of  the  CCI
circuit is not able to effectively control the current. Between 100 Hz and 10 kHz the behavior of the
circuit  appears  acceptable,  for  frequencies  below  10  Hz  the  network  composed  by  C6  and  R11
reduces the loop gain, and again the circuit is not able to control the current as wished, even if this
is an expected result.

Transient simulations have been carried out to discover any possible anomaly in the behavior of this
implementation of the CCI circuit. None has been found.
Figure  5  shows  the  transient  response  to  a  sine  signal  with  amplitude  of  1  V  and  frequency  of  1
kHz, which is a frequency within the region of acceptable behavior as shown in figure 4. The five
curves are almost undistinguishable at this scale.
Figure  6  reports  an  enlargement  of  the  transient  response.  With  effective  transducer  capacitance
increased  from  1  to  5  pF,  the  current  increases  from  9.45  to  9.50  nA.    These  values  must  be
compared to 9.19 nA as predicted by equation 18 at 1 kHz.
The band-pass behavior of the application example is not a limitation, because the useful properties
of  current  control  expressed  by  equation  14  can  be  exploited  by  using  a  sine  signal  at  a  single
frequency.
The  current  noise  density  in  CS  =4  pF  has  been  computed  with  SPICE.  The  result,  expressed  in
A/√Hz  is  shown  in  figure  7.  The  current  noise  dependence  on  the  constant  C,  which  appears  in
equation  13,  is  also  confirmed  by  SPICE  analysis.  Solid  curve  refers  to  C2=C3=30  pF,  broken
curve refers to C2=C3=60 pF. To keep invariant the time constants and satisfy the balance equation
R2 is reduced to 5 MΩ if C2=C3=60 pF.
The  simulation  has  been  made  with  temperature  equal  to  27.0  C.  Most  of  the  noise  is  due  to  the
thermal noise of R1 and R2 (about 41 fA/√Hz each for R1=R2=10 MΩ).
It must be observed that at low frequency the output impedance of this implementation of the CCI
circuit is not very high because the loop gain is reduced by network C6, R11. At low frequency the
current noise is therefore efficiently shunted by CS, CP and R1 itself.
The CCI circuit of figure 3 has been wired up on a breadboard using standard capacitors for CS, CP,
C1 and C2. The nominal capacitance of 33 pF has been  chosen for CP, C1and C2.  C3 is a 60 pF
variable capacitor. Resistor R9 has been reduced to account for the output resistance of the signal
generator. Resistors with a nominal tolerance of 1% have been employed.
A  simple  balancing  procedure  has  been  devised  for  the  breadboard  test  circuit.  First  CS  has  been
removed from the circuit, then C3 has been tuned in order to put the CCI circuit at the limit of the
stability  region,  then  CS  has  been  again  connected  to  the  circuit.  The  current  in  CS  has  been
computed by measuring the voltage output of U3 and using the known values of CS, CP and  C1.
After balancing, the circuit has proven to be unconditionally stable for CS higher than 1 pF.
Here the term unconditionally refers to the fact that the simple presence of the hands of the operator
does  not  change  the  stray  capacitance  to  the  limit  of  inducing  instability.  A  careful  electrostatic
shielding can avoid the manifestation of this effect.
Removing capacitor CS the circuit tends to oscillate at a frequency of about 1.5 kHz, which depends
on stray  capacitances.  The  reader  should  be aware  of  the fact that  oscillations  are  due  to  positive
feedback. As already stated with CS =0 the overall loop gain should be exactly zero, if with a slight
detuning the loop gain becomes positive, then the CCI circuit oscillates at the frequency where the
gain due to the OPAMP circuitry is maximum and the phase shift is zero.
The circuit has been tested at the operating frequency of 1 kHz, with supply voltages of ±15 V and
input voltage of 1 V. The property of the CCI circuit to keep constant the current in CS with CS =1
pF and CS =5.7 pF has been experimentally verified with an estimated accuracy not better than 10
%,    because  of  additional,  layout  dependent,  stray  capacitances.  In  fact,  the  determination  of  the
effective  capacitances  involved  in  the  circuit  from  the  measurements  made  on  individual
components is made slightly inaccurate by the capacitance of the wiring.
The  maximum  allowed  output  voltage  of  U3  and  the  current  dividing  properties  of  the  network
composed by CS, CP, and C1 determines the maximum available current in CS.
At the operating frequency, the network composed by capacitors  CS, CP, C1, C2 and C3 should also
present to the output of U3 an impedance high enough to avoid overload and saturation of U3 itself.
Both  in  breadboard  testing  and  with  transient  simulations,  saturation  effects  can  be  readily
observed, in agreement with the argumentation discussed above.

6 CONCLUSION

A broadband Compensated Current Injection circuit capable of injecting AC and DC currents to a
sensor or an actuator, compensating for parasitic impedances has been presented and analyzed.
In  modern  computer  controlled  instrumentation,  the  compensation  of  parasitic  impedances  is
usually made numerically and is based on the software model of the measurement system. On the
other  hand,  the  CCI  circuit  is  simpler  and  faster.  It  avoids  AD  and  DA  converters,  time  and
amplitude quantization and the related errors.
Many  different  applications  are  possible,  including  AC  electrostatic  force  actuators  with  highly
reduced stiffness, whose development has stimulated the present research.
SPICE simulations have been employed to test the circuit.
A proof of concept circuit has been wired up on a breadboard. With the breadboard circuit, overall
stability issues and nonlinear effects have been assessed.

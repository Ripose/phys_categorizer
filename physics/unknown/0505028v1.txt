A novel construction of an electrothermal vaporization (ETV) unit is described. Its main feature is an upstream within a vertical tube 
creating an axially focusing convection zone, where the condensation occurs in a laminar flow predominantly apart from the colder 
walls. The upstream is shielded against incandescent emission of the graphite furnace (GF) and surrounded with different cooling gases, 
which have additionally a focusing effect. Transport efficiencies (TEs) for Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Pb are studied using a continuum source 
coherent forward scattering multi-element spectrometer coupled to the ETV. Increasing TE with the ageing of the GF is observed. The 
effect is presumably ascribed to the growing content of carbon particulates released during the vaporization. A positive impact of K and 
Pd(NO3)2 modifiers in microgram amounts foremost on the TEs of more volatile species is observed. It is assumed that K+ ions speed 
up the nucleated condensation while the effect of Pd(NO3)2 is attributed to the more synchronous co-vaporization of analytes and 
carbon, which appears in more uniform TEs for analytes with different volatilities.  
 

Introduction 

for 

the  upstream  configuration 

Various  constructions  of  electrothermal  vaporization  (ETV) 
cells  have  been  used  as  a  sample  introduction  tool  for 
inductively  coupled  plasma  optical  emission  and  mass 
spectrometry  (ICP-OES/MS)  [1-5]  as  well  as  for  graphite 
furnace  (GF)  analytical  techniques  [6-8].  Advantages  of  the 
ETV  dosing  are  the  capability  for  solid  and  slurry  sampling, 
reduction  of  sample  preparation  time  with  decreased  risk  of 
sample contamination and of analyte loss prior to analysis. In 
addition,  the  ETV  offers  possibility  to  separate  the  analytes 
from matrix components during external thermal pretreatment 
and vaporization steps.  
Up  to  now,  the  ETV  devices  are  based  onto  two  different 
designs:  (1)  end-on  flow-through  GFs  with  vapor  outlet 
through  one  of  the  ends  of  the  graphite  tube  [2-8,  9-12],  and 
(2)  upstream  configurations  with  the  gas  entering  the  GF 
through  its  ends  and  flowing  upwards  through  a  hole  in  the 
tube center [1,8,12,12]. The comparisons show the superiority 
[12]. 
in  performance 
Nevertheless, for both constructions an evident dependence of 
analyte transport efficiency (TE) and analyte losses on element 
volatility,  sample  mass,  ETV  operating  conditions  and  other 
parameters is revealed.  
The  application  of  modifiers  as  NaCl  [9],  Mg/Pd(NO3)2 
[13,15],  citric  acid  [13],  or  components  of  diluted  NASS-3 
sea-water  [16]  can  support  formation  of  transportable  aerosol 
and increase the TE that allows to reduce the above mentioned 
dependencies  and  make  the  analyte  transport  more  uniform. 
Generally, the modifier effect is to be explained due to the co-
vaporization  of  sample  analytes  with  carrier 
forming 
constituents  that  results  in  faster  formation  of  particulates. 
Gaseous  additives  such  as  carbon  hydrates,  halide  carbon 
hydrates  [5,12,17,18],  and  carbon  particle  aerosols  [19]  are 
also  often  used  as  modifier  and  carrier  sources.  However,  in 
the  latter  case  the  effect  is  associated  rather  with  changes  in 
the  plasma  than  with  the  increased  analyte  transport.  This 
conclusion  is  supported  by  the  paper  [20]  showing  the  signal 
the  addition  of  carbon-containing 
enhancements  with 
compounds into the plasma. 
The effect of carbon particulates released from the GF during 
the  vaporization  step  was  studied  using  ultrasonic  slurry 

sampling  ETV-ICP-MS  [21,22].  It  was  conclude  that  the 
increment in signal intensity is most likely the result of carbon 
particles  released  from  the  GF  together  with  the  analytes  and 
increasing  the  analyte  TE.  A  quantitative  study  of  carbon 
losses  [23]  shows  that  the  differential  mass  loss  is  about  70-
80 µg  per  analysis  cycle  for  GFs  with  pyrolytic  coating  and 
reaches the value of 400 µg per analysis cycle for the uncoated 
tubes at the end of their lifetime. Evaluable losses are observed 
even during the drying and pyrolysis steps for both tube types. 
Several of the cited papers show that carbon particulates play 
an important role in the analyte transport. In the present work, 
the  condensation  and  transport  efficiency  is  improved  with  a 
new  construction  of  the  upstream  ETV  unit  and  the  effect  of 
carbon  released  from  the  ETV  tube  is  taken  into  account.  
Effects of K and Pd(NO3)2  modifiers on analyte transport are 
discussed. 
 
Experimental 

Instrumentation 

A  new  laboratory  constructed  ETV  unit  with  a  vertical  tube 
creating  an  axially  focusing  convection  (AFC)  upstream  is 
employed.  Fig. 1  shows  principle  and  flow  scheme  that  has 
become  more  sophisticated  since  previous  publication  [8].  
The internal flow enters the GF tube through the contact cones 
and  is  released  through  a  hole  (diameter  3 mm)  in  the  tube 
center. Pyrolytically coated tubes (Schunk Kohlenstofftechnik 
GmbH,  Heuchelheim,  Germany)  have  been  used  (length, 
outer,  and  inner  diameter:  53  mm,  10  mm,  and  8  mm).  The 
upstream is surrounded with several cooling gases, which have 
additionally a focusing effect.  The radiation shield is mounted 
2.5-3 mm above the GF. The splitting of the external flows 1 
and  2  is  adjusted  via  changing  the  distances  between  the 
radiation shield and the AFC tube, whereas the sluice gas flow 
is  controlled  separately.  The  generated  aerosol  is  transferred 
via  a  tygon®  tubing  (Norton,  Akron,  OH,  USA)  to  a 
continuum  source  coherent  forward  scattering  multi-element 
spectrometer  (CS-CFS).  Instrumental  parameters  and  detailed 
description  of  the  spectrometer  are  given  elsewhere  [6,7,24-
26].  On  the  transport  path  the  aerosol  is  split  in  the  1:9  ratio 
[8] and then collected via electrostatic precipitation (EP) with

a  corona-like  discharge  [7,27-30]  upon  the  platform  of  the 
HGA-600  furnace.  Temperature  programs  for  ETV  and 
HGA-600  are  given  in  Table 1.  ETV  temperatures  are 
controlled  with  an  optical  pyrometer  PB06F2  (Keller  GmbH, 
Ibbenbueren, Germany). 
A fast PtRh- PtRh thermocouple (type B, τ = 50 ms, operating 
range  50 - 1800°C)  is  used  for  temperature  measurements  in 
the upstream. A micrometer screw was used for the coordinate 
controlling.  The 
the 
thermoelement  were  digitalized  and  fed  to  a  computer  via  an 
IEEE bus card.

Reagents 

As  samples  and  for  calibration  aqueous  multi-element 
solutions were prepared by adequate dilution of standard stock 
solutions  of  metal  nitrates  with  double  distilled  water  and 
acidified  with  nitric  acid  of  suprapur®  grade  to  obtain  1-2% 
concentration (reagents produced by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, 
Germany).  Analyte  contents  in  samples  for  ETV  with 
subsequent  1:9  splitting  before  EP  are  listed  in  Table 2. 
Solutions for calibration with CS-CFS contain one tenth of the 
analyte concentrations. 
Modifiers  were  prepared  by  adequate  dilution  of  potassium 
standard  stock  solution  and  palladium  modifier  solution.  The 
dose volume was 10 µL that corresponds to the mass of 1 µg. 
Argon  (99.996%  purity,  Messer  Griesheim  GmbH,  Krefeld, 
Germany)  was  employed  as  internal,  external,  and  sluice 
gases.  

Procedures 

flows 

remained 

constant  during 

The whole ETV-EP CS-CFS analysis cycle is described in our 
previous  paper  [8].  The  total  (1.5 L/min)  and  the  internal 
(200 mL/min) 
these 
measurements,  whereas  splitting  ratio  into  the  sluice  and 
external sub-flows was varied (1.3 mL/min in sum). TEs were 
determined  by  comparing  multi-element  CS-CFS  signals 
obtained  by  dosing  the  calibration  solutions  directly  into  the 
HGA-600  furnace  of  the  spectrometer  with  signals  obtained 
using the sample solutions subjected to the ETV-EP process.  
At  the  various  points  along  the vertical axis  of  the  AFC  tube 
(from 2.5 mm above the GF outlet until the outlet of the AFC 
tube),  temperature  measurements  were  done  during  the 
vaporization  and  subsequent  cool-down  steps.  For 
the 
gravimetrical  tracing,  the  accumulative  mass  losses  in  the 
course  of  the  analytical  tube  lifetime  were  determined.  The 
tube  was  weighted  after  each  series  of  measurements  with  a 
balance.  The  differential  losses  were  roughly  estimated  as  an 
average of a weight difference per respective number of shots 
(the vaporizing and clean firings were taken into account). 

Estimations of vapor saturation 

 

 

 

(1) 

The saturation ratio is defined as [30] 
 
S = p/ps ,   
where  p  is  an  actual  partial  pressure,  ps  is  a  saturation  vapor 
pressure  at  the  gas  temperature.  The  saturation  ratios  for 
different  temperatures  during  cool-down  obtained  with  vapor 
pressure  parameters  given  in  [32]  are  listed  in  Table 3.  The 
data are calculated for the monoatomic densities produced by 
vaporization of analytes, matrix modifiers, and carbon into the 
Ar flow (200 mL/min) during 1 second. No reduction of vapor 
density  either  by  condensation,  chemical  reactions,  or  by  gas 
mixing is considered. 
The  supersaturation  of  the  carbon  vapor  at  the  vaporization 
temperature  shows  that  the  carbon  could  be  obtained  in  the 
form of polyatomic particulates even within the GF. Except for 
the high volatile analytes (Pb) and for the elements with higher 
concentrations  (K  and  Pd),  self-nucleation,  if  applicable, 
would be occur as a desublimation (gas-to-solid) process.  

Results and discussion 

ETV optimization 

The first tests of the AFC configuration showed that the inner 
diameter of the convection tube is critical. If it is too large, the 
upstream  flow  becomes  faster  and  leads  to  a  counter-flowing 
downstream  at  the  tube  walls  due  to  the  rapid  thermal 
expansion  and  high  buoyant  force;  the  formed  turbulences 
strongly  reduce  the  volume  density  of  the  condensing 
particulates  and  cause  the  analyte  adsorption  upon  the  walls. 
At too low tube diameters, the wall condensation becomes the 
main  mechanism  of 
losses  as  well.  The 
the  analyte 
comparative measurements with smoking samples and gaseous 
additives  to  the  internal  flow  showed  that  the  optimal  inner 
AFC tube diameter in our case is about 13 mm.  
In order to reduce the heating via incandescent radiation of the 
GF  walls,  the  AFC  tube  and  condensing  particulates  in  the 
upstream  are  shielded  (see  Fig. 1).  Moreover,  it  allowed  to 
improve the temperature gradients directly above the GF outlet 
by  means  of  laminar-like  surrounding  with  cooling  external 
and sluice gas flows which have a focusing effect in addition. 
In  addition,  the  introduction  of  the  sluice  gas  reduced  the 
contamination  of  the  transport  tubing  and  the  EP  cell  by 
carbon originating from the outer GF wall.   

Effect of sluice gas addition 

Fig. 2a presents the dependence of the CS-CFS signals for Pb, 
Mn,  Cu,  Fe,  and  Ni  on  the  ETV  flow  distributions.  Optimal 
conditions for analyte condensation and transport are found at 
200 mL/min  sluice  gas  flow  rate.  Higher  sluice  gas  flows 
cause obviously turbulences in the upstream leading to analyte 
losses. 
Fig. 2b shows a quantitative evaluation of the TE enhancement 
with  the  addition  of  the  sluice  gas.  The  new  setup  shows 
higher TEs (improved up to 10%); nevertheless, the losses of 
volatile  analytes  as  well  as  the  non-uniformities  in  the  TEs 
remain to be high. Discrepancies between the CS-CFS signals 
and  the  TEs  for  Fe  and  Ni  are  possibly  caused,  along  with 
other  factors,  by  an  effect  of  the  GF  carbon  (see  below). 
During  these  measurements,  this  influence  on  the  analyte  TE 
was first observed. 

Temporal  and  spatial  temperature  dependence  in  the 
upstream 

the 

the  sluice  gas.  Fig. 3(a),(b)  shows 

In  order  to  estimate  the  temperature  gradients  directly  above 
the GF outlet, the temperature behavior along the upstream is 
studied. The measurements are performed without an addition 
of 
temperature 
dependence  for 
the  optimized  and  non-optimized  flow 
distributions, correspondingly, at the different points upon the 
vertical  axis  (z =4 mm,  z = 9 mm,  and  z = 24 mm).  The  noise 
fluctuations  on  the  curves  are  likely  caused  by  a  turbulent 
behavior  in  the  upstream.  This  assumption  is  confirmed  by 
observing  the  upstream  flow  with  additives  forming  visible 
soot  particulates.  The  shape  of  the  decay  is  defined  by  the 
stepwise  cool-down  (Table 1a)  that  should  prevent  a  reverse 
flow owing to gas contraction.  
Fig. 3(c)  shows  the  temperature  distribution  for  different 
splitting  ratios  of  the  external  flow  (h =0 mm,  h = 3 mm,  and 
h = 14 mm) at one point (z = 24 mm).  When the AFC tube is 
positioned  directly  onto  the  top  of  the  radiation  shield 
(h = 0 mm),  the  upstream  temperatures  are  higher  during  the 
complete  vaporization  process  that  results  in  decreased 
temperature  gradients  along  the  condensation  zone.    It  is 
caused  by  the  fact  that  the  external  flow  1  (see  Fig. 1) 
surrounds  the  upstream  under  the  shield  and  hence  is  more 
heated  than  the  external  flow  2  that  enters  above  the  plate.  
This  effect,  along  with 
the 
the 
condensation  slower  and  can  enhance  the  analyte  losses.  At 

turbulences,  makes

too  large  distances  between  the  radiation  shield  and  the 
convection  tube  (h = 14 mm),  the  temperature  gradients  are 
slightly higher (at least above the shield) obviously due to the 
colder  part  of  the  external  flow.  Nevertheless,  the  occurring 
turbulences eliminate this advantage.

they  are  much 
lower  (about  60 K/cm).  Under  certain 
assumptions,  these  data  could  be  applied  for  the  modeling  of 
the condensation processes.

Effect of GF carbon on analyte TE 

inside 

the  GF.  Therefore, 

Fig. 4(a)  shows  the  accumulative  (dotted  line)  and  the 
differential (solid line) material loss of the GF. The differential 
mass  loss  with  the  GF  ageing  does  not  suffer  significant 
variations and is about 80-100 µg pro shot. An enhancement of 
the  losses  up  to  200-250 µg/shot  is  observed  with  the 
approaching to the analytical tube lifetime. This curve is good 
reproducible under constant experimental conditions and is in 
agreement with the data given in Ref. [23].   
An  impact  of  the  vaporized  material  composed  mainly  of 
carbon  particulates  on  the  TE  of  Pb,  Mn,  Cu,  Fe,  and  Ni  is 
shown  in  Fig. 4(b)-(f).  Increasing  TE  with  the  tube  ageing  is 
observed for all analytes studied and is presumably associated 
with the increased density of carbon particulates co-vaporized 
with the analytes. The co-vaporization is obviously supported 
by  the  platform  effect  of  the  GF  boat  in  addition  to  other 
known  mechanisms  of  carbon  appearance  at  earlier  times 
[21,22].  Owing  to  the  performed  pyrometrical  tracing  of  the 
platform and GF temperatures during the vaporization step, the 
platform  achieves  the  pre-set  temperature  1-2 s  later  than  the 
graphite tube. Moreover, Table 3 shows that the carbon vapor 
is  highly  supersaturated  even  at  the  vaporization  temperature 
the  carbon 
within 
particulates  can  be  probably  found  in  the  form  of  relatively 
large  polyatomic  structures. 
  An  analyte  vaporachieves 
supersaturation at much lower temperatures (cf. Table 3)  and, 
therefore, the analyte self-nucleation, if this term is applicable, 
starts much later. Thus, the nucleated condensation of analytes 
as a process promoted by the presence of condensation nuclei 
can be a predominant mechanism of the particulate formation. 
The analytes can be adsorbed by the carbon aerosol composed 
of  growing  carbon  particulates.  This  mechanism  probably 
leads  to  the  packing  of  the  analytes  into  the  carbon 
particulates. 
The enhancement of analyte TEs is most likely reduced by the 
intercalation of metals and metal-containing molecular species 
into  the  interplanar  space  of  the  graphite  sheets  when  the 
pyrolytic  coating  is  coming  to  be  destroyed.  The  decrease  of 
the  actual  vaporization  temperature  from  its  initial  value 
caused  by  the  material  loss  during  the  tube  ageing  (that 
possibly  results  in  non-complete  analyte  vaporization)  is  less 
than 1%, according to our estimations and, therefore, is of less 
importance.  The  graphite  losses  may  be  enhanced  by  contact 
of  the  GF  tube  with  ambient  air  before  and  during  the 
measurement  cycle.  This  mechanism  can  also  play  an 
important role in the analyte TE increase.  
Thus,  the  behavior  of  the  analyte  TEs  (Fig. 4(b)-(f))  is  very 
likely defined by several competing impact mechanisms. Two 

tube 

the 

of  them  are  the  analyte  intercalation  and  the  carbon  loss.  It 
seems that the gaseous carbon-containing additives to the inert 
gas  may  protect  the  graphite  surface  and  stabilize  the  carbon 
fluctuations during the vaporization of analytes. 

Effects of K and Pd(NO3)2 modifiers on analyte TEs 

to 

Fig. 5  shows  a  comparison  of  analyte  TEs  without  and  with 
1 µg  K  or  Pd  modifiers  added 
the  sample.  The 
measurements  are  done  for  the  tube  ages  150-180  shots 
corresponding  to  100-120 µg/shot  differential  mass  losses 
(Fig. 4(a)).    A  slight  shift  in  the  signal  appearance  towards 
earlier times is observed for all analytes studied with the use of 
K. The addition of K leads to the enhanced TEs of the analytes 
higher volatility such as Pb and Mn. One possible explanation 
is  that the easily  ionized  K-particles  support  the  formation  of 
the  carbon  aerosol.  Ions  can  serve  as  nuclei  for  the  soot 
formation [33]. Therefore, K can play an important role at the 
beginning of the carbon condensation that results in increased 
TEs of more volatile species. Certainly, it can act as a carrier 
by  itself,  but  this  mechanism  is  less  probable,  because  the  K 
begins to form particles via self-nucleation much later than the 
other metals with higher melting points (cf. Table 3).  
With addition of diluted Pd(NO3)2 modifier, a remarkable shift 
in  the  signal  appearance  toward  later  times  and  a  significant 
narrowing of the signal profiles are observed. The shift is most 
pronounced  for  the  volatile  analytes.  It  leads  to  a  larger 
temporal  overlapping  of  the  carbon  and  the  analyte  presence 
inside  the  condensation  zone.  Pd  can  also  act  as  an  analyte 
carrier  owing  to  the  early-achieved  supersaturation  (Table 3). 
However,  the  presence  of  the  carbon  particulates  in  much 
higher  quantities  very  likely  makes  this  influence  negligible. 
Some outcomes should be further investigated. Until now, we 
do  not  have  any  satisfactory  explanation  for  the  behavior  of 
the  TE  of  Cu  with  the  addition  of  modifiers,  although  the 
positive  effect  of  K  has  been  already  documented  [8]. 
Nevertheless,  on  the  basis  of  our  measurements,  we  can 
conclude  that  the  use  of  the  sample/carrier  modifiers  makes 
the  TEs  more  uniform  and  less  dependent  on  the  analyte 
volatility.

Pd(NO3)2 supports analyte co-vaporization with the GF carbon 
by means of decreasing the volatility of analytes. The acting of 
usually applied amounts of modifiers as carriers by themselves 
can be neglected because of their relatively small fractions in 
comparison  with  the  carbon  amounts  vaporized  per  one  ETV 
firing.

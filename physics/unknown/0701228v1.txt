Abstract 
 

A  new  carbazole  derivative  with  a  3,3’-bicarbazyl  core  6,6’-substituted  by  dicyanovinylene  groups  (6,6’-bis(1-(2,2’-dicyano)vinyl)-N,N’-
dioctyl-3,3’-bicarbazyl;  named  (OcCz2CN)2,  was  synthesized  by  carbonyl-methylene  Knovenagel  condensation,  characterized  and  used  as  a 
component  of  multilayer  organic  light-emitting  diodes  (OLEDs).  Due  to  its π-donor–acceptor  type  structure,  (OcCz2CN)2  was  found  to  emit  a 
yellow light at λmax=590 nm (with the CIE coordinates x=0.51; y = 0.47) and was used either as a dopant or as an ultra-thin layer in a blue-emitting 
matrix  of  4,4’-bis(2,2’-diphenylvinyl)-1,1’-biphenyl  (DPVBi).  DPVBi  (OcCz2CN)2-doped  structure  exhibited,  at  doping  ratio of  1.5  weight  %,  a 
yellowish-green light with the CIE coordinates (x = 0.31; y = 0.51), an electroluminescence efficiency ηEL=1.3 cd/A, an external quantum efficiency 
ηext= 0.4 % and a luminance L= 127 cd/m2 (at 10 mA/cm2) whereas for non-doped devices utilizing the carbazolic fluorophore as a thin neat layer, a 
warm white with CIE coordinates (x = 0.40; y= 0.43), ηEL= 2.0 cd/A, ηext= 0.7 %, L = 197 cd/m2 (at 10 mA/cm2) and a color rendering index (CRI) 
of  74,  were  obtained.  Electroluminescence  performances  of  both  the  doped  and  non-doped  devices  were  compared  with  those  obtained  with 
5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphtacene (rubrene) taken as a reference of highly efficient yellow emitter.

[1].  Moreover, 

the  demonstration  of 

light  emitting  diodes  (OLEDs)  have 
attracted  great  attention  for  full-colour  flat-panel 
efficient 
displays 
electroluminescent 
the 
tremendous  progress  in  device  luminous  efficiency  [2] 
and the emerging viability as a commercial display open 
new  markets  for  white  OLEDs  (WOLEDs), 
like 
backlight for liquid crystal displays or lighting sources. 
WOLEDs can be considered as potential large area next 
generation  of  solid  state  lighting  sources  to  replace 
traditional  incandescent  white  light  sources,  thanks  to 
their  potential  of  energy  saving,  their  high  efficiencies 
and  their  possibility  to  fabricate  thin  and  flexible 
devices  [3].  To  achieve  white  emission,  various 
methods have been used  such  as  e.g.  multilayer  diodes 
using the combination of the three primary colours Red, 
Green 
(RGB),  multiple-quantum-well 
architecture [4], or exciplex formation [5]. Among these 
various  devices,  numerous  doped-type  WOLEDs  using 
two  emission  colours  to  produce  white  have  been 
fabricated  [6,7]  but  it  remains  technologically  difficult 
to attain an accurate control of the dopant concentration 
at low doping ratio through the co-evaporation process. 
We  recently  utilized  the  delta-doping  technique  [8],  a 
way 
including  balanced  white 
emission, in a multilayer non-doped OLED [9-11] based 
on blue matrices, in which we inserted an ultrathin layer 
of rubrene as a yellow emitter [12]. Hence, we intended 
to test another yellow material with a different structure 
and coming from the carbazolic molecular derivatives.

With  such  a  goal,  we  report,  herein,  on  the 
synthesis  of  a  novel  carbazole  derivative  with  an 
electron-donating  3,3’-bicarbazyl  core  linked,  at  the 
6,6’-positions,  to  electron-accepting  dicyanovinylene 
groups i.e. 6,6’-bis(1-(2,2’-dicyano)vinyl)-N,N’-dioctyl-
3,3’-bicarbazyl  (named  (OcCz2CN)2).  This  compound, 
was  synthesized  by  carbonyl-methylene  Knovenagel 
condensation  between  bicarbazyl  dialdehyde  and 
dicyanomethane  and  was  characterized  by  1H  and  13C 
NMR, 
emission 
spectroscopies  and  cyclic  voltammetry.  Molecular 
structure of (OcCz2CN)2,  is  shown  in Figure  1. Due  to 
(OcCz2CN)2 
type 
its  π-donor-acceptor 
exhibits  an  energy  band-gap  of  Eg  =  2.4  eV  and  was 
found

Internationale  de 
l’Eclairage  (CIE)  coordinates  of 
(x=0.51;  y  =  0.47).  It  was  used  in  multilayer  OLEDs 
either,  as  a  dopant  of  a  blue-emitting  matrix  of  4,4’-
bis(2,2’-diphenylvinyl)-1,1’-biphenyl (DPVBi) or as an 
ultrathin layer inserted in the latter. For a doping ratio of

utilizing a thin layer of (OcCz2CN)2 within the exciton

performances and an emission colour varying from

For 

such  delta-doped  devices  utilizing  a 
carbazolic  thin  neat  layer,  white  emission  with  CIE 
coordinates  (x  =  0.40;  y=  0.43), ηEL=  2.0  cd/A, ηext= 
0.7  %,  L  =  197  cd/m2,  were  obtained.  To  the  best  of 
our knowledge, it is the first report of a white OLED 
using a carbazolic material as a thin emitting layer. EL 
performances  of  both  devices  were  compared  with 
those  obtained  with  rubrene  taken  as  the  reference  of 
highly  efficient  yellow  fluorophore  and  known  to 
enhance  multilayer  device  efficiency  and  stability

1H  and  13C  NMR  spectra  were  recorded  in 
solution in CDCl3 with a Brucker AC200 spectrometer 
at 200 and 50 MHz respectively; all chemical shifts (δ 
in  ppm)  were  referenced  to  tetramethylsilane  (TMS). 
UV-visible  spectroscopy  was  carried  out  using  a 
Perkin  Elmer  spectrometer  (model  Lambda  12)  with 
0.5 cm path quartz cells. For solid-state measurements, 
(OcCz2CN)2  chloroform  solutions  were  cast  onto 
quartz plates. Optical band gap Eg was estimated from 
the 
spectra. 
Photoluminescence spectra were obtained with a Safas 
model  flx-Xenius  spectrofluorometer  with  a  Xenon 
150 W lamp. Cyclic voltammetry (cv) experiments of 
solution-cast  films  of  (OcCz2CN)2  onto  conducting 
support were carried out in acetonitrile (HPLC grade, 
Fisher  Scientific)  containing  0.3  M  of  LiClO4 
(Aldrich)  as  a  supporting  electrolyte  in  a  one-
compartment cell equipped with three electrodes. The 
working  anode  was  glassy  carbon,  the  counter-
electrode  a  platinum  wire,  the  reference  electrode 
being a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) at 4.75 eV.

types  of  devices  with  the  detail  of  the  organic 
compounds and the thickness of each layer of the two 
types  of  devices  a)-type  (DPVBi  layer  doped  with 
yellow  emitter)  and  b)-type  (non-doped  type,  with  a 
thin  layer  of  yellow  emitter  in  DPVBi).  Indium  tin 
oxyde  (ITO)-coated  glass  with  sheet  resistance  of 
about  15  Ω/(cid:13)  was  obtained  from  Asahi.  Prior  using, 
the  glass  was  cleaned  by  sonication  in  a  detergent 
solution  and  then  rinsed  in  de-ionized  water.  The

thickness  of 

organic compounds are deposited onto the ITO anode 
by  sublimation  under  high  vacuum  (10-7  Torr)  with  a 
rate  of  0.2  –  0.3  nm/s.  An  in-situ  quartz  crystal  was 
the  vacuum 
used 
depositions.  The  active  area  of  each  OLED  was  0.3 
cm2.  In  the  doped  configuration,  we  sequentially 
deposited onto the ITO anode: a thin (10 nm) layer of 
copper phtalocyanine (CuPc) as a hole-injecting layer, 
then  a  50  nm  thick  NPB  layer  as  a  hole-transporting 
layer (HTL). A 60 nm thick DPVBi layer doped with 
the yellow emitter (OcCz2CN)2 is then deposited and 
acts as a blue matrix and an electron-transporting layer 
is  controlled  by  co-
(ETL).  The  doping  ratio 
evaporation  of  host  and  dopant  and  was  optimized  to 
be  1.5%  (in  weight  percent)  of  (OcCz2CN)2,  the 
accuracy  of  the  doping  rate  being  around  10%. 
Finally,  a  thin  (10  nm)  AlQ3  layer  was  used  as  an 
electron-injecting layer onto the top cathode consisting 
in 1.2 nm of LiF capped with 100nm of Al. In the non-
doped configuration, the same sequential process was 
followed,  keeping  constant  the  thicknesses  of  the 
organic  layers,  the  only  difference  from  the  doped 
configuration  being 
layer  of 
(OcCz2CN)2 was inserted within the DPVBI layer, at 
a  position  d  from  the  NPB/DPVBi  interface  in  the 
range 0 ≤ d ≤10 nm. Such a range corresponds to the 
exciton diffusion domain within the DPVBi side [12].  
Electroluminescence

coordinates were recorded with a PR 650 SpectraScan 
spectrophotometer  at  a  constant  current  density  of 
10mA/cm2.  The  Current-Voltage  and  Current-
Luminance (I-V and I-L) characteristics of the diodes 
were  measured  with  a  regulated  power  supply  (ACT 
10 Fontaine) combined with a multimeter and a 1 cm2 
area  silicon  calibrated  photodiode  (Hamamatsu).  All 
the  measurements  were  performed

any encapsulation. An important quality of white light

radiator  or  daylight).  As  defined  by  the  Commission 
Internationale  de  l’Eclairage  [21],  a  set  of  eight 
calibrated  samples  with  different  absorption  spectra 
and a reference illuminant are used to define the CRI.

As  illustrated  in  Figure  2  the  synthesis  of 
(OcCz2CN)2 
two  steps.  At  first, 
in 
bicarbazyldialdehyde  was  prepared  by  formylation  of 
bicarbazyl according to the method that we previously 
described  [20].  In  a  second  step,  (OcCz2CN)2  was 
obtained  by  Knovenagel  condensation  of 
the 
bicarbazyldialdehyde 
reactive 
as 
compound,  with  dicyanomethane  as  the  methylene 
active  derivative.  Both  the  1H  and  13C  NMR  spectra 
and  elemental  analysis  are  in  agreement  with  the 
chemical structure of (OcCz2CN)2 shown in Figure 1.

the 

 
Absorption  and  photoluminescence  spectra  of 
50nm  thin  film  of  the  tetracyanobicarbazyl  derivative 
deposited  onto  a  quartz  plate  are  shown  in  Figure  4. 
Absorption  spectrum  is  obtained  by  exciting  the  thin 
film in the range of 300–700 nm wavelengths. The

spectra of the 50nm thick film of (OcCz2CN)2. 
 
photoluminescence  spectrum  is  so  determined  by 
exciting the film around the absorption maxima.  
 

As  already  reported  for  several  donor-acceptor 
carbazole-based  molecules,  substitution  in  3-position 
of  the  electron-donor  heterocycle  by  cyanovinylene 
electron-withdrawing  groups  leads  to  an  internal 
charge transfer which shows up in the visible domain 
of the optical spectrum [23]. In the case of  
(OcCz2CN)2, i.e 3,3’-dimer of OcCz2CN, the charge-
transfer  band  is  peaking  at λmax=  450  nm.  From  the 
onset  of  the  absorption  threshold  of  the  spectrum  the 
energy gap value Eg was found to be close to 2.4 eV. 
Furthermore,  it  is  noteworthy  that  π-conjugation 
within  the  bicarbazyl  core  provokes,  as  expected,  a 
red-shift  of  the  visible  band,  since  the  corresponding 
signal appears at λmax= 428 nm for films of OcCz2CN 
monomer  (Eg=2.7  eV)  [23].  Hence,  a  yellow-light 
emission 
(OcCz2CN)2  with  a 
for 
maximum at λmax= 590 nm (Figure 4) whereas a green 
one is observed for the monomer derivative (λmax= 528 
nm). Such an effect of the extension of π-conjugation 
on  the  shift  of  the  emission  color  appeared  in  red-
emitting  N-arylcarbazoles 
in  3,(6)-
position(s) by three conjugated double bonds ended by 
a dicyano group, recently reported by Fu et al. [24].  
 

is  observed 

substituted 

Cyclic voltammetry of (OcCz2CN)2 (at a scan rate 
of  10  mV/s),  allowed  an  estimation  of  its  ionization 
potential  IP  (HOMO  level).  An  oxidation  process  at 
Eox = 0.95 V/SCE (HOMO level at 5.7eV) is observed 
corresponding  to  the  formation  of  carbazolic  radical-
cations  [25].  This  value  is  0.10  V  higher  than  that 
observed for 3,3’ unsubstituted bicarbazyl, as expected 
from  the  effect  of  the  electron-acceptor  groups. 
Indeed, it has been shown that such substituents make 
the  carbazole  core  less  oxidizable  and  lead  to  an 
anodic  shift  of  the  oxidation  potential.  On  the 
opposite,  introduction  of  acceptor  groups  is  expected 
to increase the electronic affinity EA. Nevertheless, no 
clear 
the 
electrochemical  reduction  domain  of  cv  and  LUMO 
level value was deduced from the optical energy band-
gap Eg and HOMO values according to the expression 
EHOMO – ELUMO = Eg. Such estimation leads to a value 
of 3.3 eV for the LUMO.

having  close  LUMO  and  HOMO  levels  (3.2  eV 
against 3.3 eV and 5.4 eV against 5.7 eV respectively). 
This  is  not  surprising  as  it  has  been  reported  that 
rubrene  dispersed  in  a  host  layer  acts  as  a  very 
efficient  trap  charge  carrier  and  recombination  center 
[27].  In  order  to  attain  a  color-control  we  tested 
another  type of  OLED  configuration i.e.  a  non-doped 
device with a thin film of (OcCz2CN)2 inserted in the

A  1  nm-thick  layer  of  the  carbazolic  dimer  was 
inserted  within  the  DPVBi  blue-emitting  matrice  at  a 
position d from the NPB/DPVBi interface in the range 
0  ≤  d  ≤10  nm.  By  using  an  ultrathin  rubrene  sensing 
layer  we  recently  found  for  the  same  structure  that 
such  a  d  range  corresponds  to  the  exciton  diffusion 
domain  within  the  DPVBi  layer  (diffusion  length 
around 9nm) [12].  

 
Typical emission spectra for different values of d 
(5,  7  and  10  nm)  are  shown  on  Figure  6  with 
corresponding  CIE  coordinates  in  Inset.  In  these 
configurations,  the  emission  spectrum  consists  in  two 
blue and yellow peaks. The relative intensity of these 
peaks  is  sensitive  to  the  position  of  the  carbazolic 
layer  from  the  interface.  With  increased  d  from  5  to 
10nm, the amount of blue is increased by the exciton 
diffusion in the DPVBi matrix.

ITO/CuPc/NPB/DPVBi:(OcCz2CN)2/AlQ3/LiF/Al 
(DPVBI  doped  with  1.5%  and  3.3%)  of  the  yellow 
emitter is shown on Figure 5. 
 

A  good  overlapping  between 

(OcCz2CN)2 
absorption and DPVBi emission (inset Figure 5) leads 
to an efficient Förster transfer process. With increased 
(OcCz2CN)2  concentration  from  1.4  to  3.3  wt  %,  the 
wavelength of the peak red shifts from 520 to 540nm. 
This  red-shift  of  the  EL  peak  could  be  attributed  to 
polarization  phenomena  [26].  Meanwhile,  external 
quantum  efficiency ηext  decreases  from  0.4  to  0.3  %. 
Such an effect of the dopant concentration on ηext may 
arise  from  a  quenching  process.  EL  parameters  of 
doped devices are presented in Table 1. 

 
Doping DPVBi with 1.5% wt of rubrene, taken as 
a reference of highly efficient yellow emitter, led to an 
important  improvement  of  all  the  EL  parameters  as 
e.g.  a ηext  =  2.5  %  (Table  1),  a  greenish-yellow  light 
being  observed.  These  results  show  that  rubrene  is  a

Influence  of  the  position  d  of  the  (OcCz2CN)2 
layer on performances and CIE coordinates for several 
devices  are  shown  on  Table  2.  In  absence  of  yellow 
emitter,  a  deep  blue 
luminescence  with  CIE 
coordinates  (0.17;  0.15),  a  quantum  efficiency  ηext= 
2.8  %  characteristical  of  DPVBi  were  observed  (see 
EL  performances  of  undoped  DPVBi  Table  1).  Pure 
yellow  emission  with  CIE  coordinates  (0.51;  0.47) 
corresponding  to  the  emission  light  of  (OcCz2CN)2 
molecules is achieved when the carbazolic compound 
lies  exactly  at  the  interface  (d  =  0).  Here,  the  energy 
transfer between DPVBi excitons and (OcCz2CN)2 is 
complete,  as  a  consequence  of  the  efficient  Förster 
process. Nevertheless, the quantum efficiency is ηext= 
0.3%  around  one  order  of  magnitude  lower  than  that 
of the blue OLED, showing that important quenching 
limits the efficiency. A warm white standard emission 
closed to – illuminant A- with CIE coordinates (0.40; 
0.43), a ηext = 0.7 %, a ηEL = 0.7 cd/A, a luminance L = 
932 cd/m2 at 60mA/cm2 (197 cd/m2 at 10mA/cm2) and 
a  quite  good  Color  Rendering  Index  of  74,  were 
obtained for a position d = 10 nm. To the best of our 
knowledge, it is the first report of a white OLED using 
a  carbazolic  molecular  compound  as  a  thin  emitting 
layer.  Intermediary  yellowish-green  light  (CIE:  0.47; 
0.48)  and  yellow  (CIE:  0.43;  0.46)  lights  were 
obtained for d = 5 nm and d = 7 nm respectively. 
 

For comparison, devices utilizing 1nm of rubrene 
instead  of  (OcCz2CN)2  have  found  to  produce  white 
light with similar CIE coordinates [12] and a quantum 
efficiency ηext= 2.6 %, at a closier d position from the 
emitting  interface  i.e.  d  =  5  nm  from  the  emitting 
interface. We can also observe that when increasing d 
from  0  to  10nm,  CIE  coordinates  of  rubrene-doped 
DPVBi  decrease  from  yellow  (0.51;  0.48)  to  blue-
white (0.25; 0.23). In the case of the (OcCz2CN)2, the 
decrease  is  weaker,  from  (0.51;  0.47)  to  (0.40;  0.43). 
At  d  =  10nm,  blue  emission  is  more  important  in  the 
rubrene configuration. 

 

 
4.  Conclusion 
 

A  new  carbazole  derivative  6,6’-bis(1-(2,2’-

dicyano)vinyl)-N,N’-dioctyl-3,3’-bicarbazyl 
((OcCz2CN)2),  was  synthetised  by  Knovenagel 
condensation  and  used  as  an  active  molecule  in 
multilayer  organic  light-emitting  diodes  (OLEDs). 
Due  to  the  π-donor–acceptor  conjugation  developed 
 

(DPVBi). 

thin  carbazole  yellow-emitting 

between  the  electron-donor  carbazolic  moieties  and 
the  cyanovinylene  electron-withdrawing  groups, 
(OcCz2CN)2  was  found  to  emit  a  yellow  light  at 
λmax=590  nm  with  CIE  coordinates  (x  =  0.51;  y  = 
0.47)  and  was  used  either  as  a  dopant  or  as  an  ultra-
thin  layer  in  a  blue-emitting  matrice  of  4,4’-bis(2,2’-
diphenylvinyl)-1,1’-biphenyl 
DPVBi 
(OcCz2CN)2-doped structure exhibited, at doping ratio 
of  1.5  weight  %,  a  yellowish-green  light  with  CIE 
coordinates  (x  =  0.31;  y  =  0.51),  an  electrolumines-
cence  efficiency  ηEL=1.3  cd/A,  an  external  quantum 
efficiency ηext= 0.4 % and a luminance L= 127 cd/m2 
(at  10  mA/cm2)  whereas  for  non-doped  devices 
utilizing  a 
layer 
inserted  in  a  blue-emitting  DPVBi  matrix,  white 
OLEDs  carbazole-based  have  been  achieved  for  the 
first time. A warm white light with CIE coordinates (x 
= 0.40; y= 0.43), ηEL= 2.0 cd/A, ηext= 0.7 %, L = 197 
cd/m2  (at  10  mA/cm2)  and  a  quite  good  Color 
Rendering 
(CRI)  of  74,  were  obtained. 
Electroluminescence  performances  of  both  the  doped 
and  non-doped  devices  were  much  lower  that  those 
5,6,11,12-tetraphenylnaphtacene 
obtained 
(rubrene)  taken  as  a  reference  of  highly  efficient 
yellow  emitter.  Thus,  more  efficient  yellow-emitting 
carbazoles  are  required  and  remain  to  be  synthesized 
to be competitive with rubrene.

Abstract

We deﬁne aﬃne transport lifts on the tangent bundle by associating a transport rule for tangent
vectors with a vector ﬁeld on the base manifold. The aim is to develop tools for the study of kinetic/
dynamical symmetries in relativistic particle motion. The transport lift uniﬁes and generalises the
various existing lifted vector ﬁelds, with clear geometric interpretations. We ﬁnd the aﬃne dynamical
symmetries of general relativistic particle motion, and compare this to previous results and to the
alternative concept of “matter symmetry”.

Introduction

Vector ﬁelds on the tangent bundle T M , arising as the lifts of vectors or of transformations on the base
manifold M , have been deﬁned and applied in diﬀerential geometry, Lagrangian mechanics and relativity.
For example the complete (or natural or Lie), horizontal and vertical lifts [1]–[4], the projective and
conformal lifts [5] and the matter symmetries of Berezdivin and Sachs [6], [7]. Our aim is to ﬁnd a more
general way of lifting from M to T M than the usual deﬁnitions that involve only the vector ﬁeld on M ,
and possibly the connection on M . In fact the matter symmetries of [6] are a step in this direction. We
generalise this concept in a way that gives a clear geometric foundation to all the lifts previously deﬁned,
and to new lifts which can be deﬁned.

The main idea [8] is to associate a transport rule for tangent vectors with a vector ﬁeld on M . This
deﬁnes a vector ﬁeld on T M – the transport lift. The class of aﬃne transport lifts (ATL’s) generalises
all previously deﬁned lifts in a uniﬁed and geometrical way. We ﬁnd conditions under which ATL’s are
dynamical symmetries for particle trajectories in (semi-) Riemannian manifolds.

2 Local geometry of the tangent bundle

We give a brief summary of the relevant local diﬀerential geometry of the tangent bundle assuming only a
knowledge of basic tensor analysis on manifolds. Consider a (semi-) Riemannian n-manifold (M, g) with
local coordinates xa and metric connection Γa
bc (Christoﬀel symbols). The tangent bundle T M is the
union of all tangent spaces (ﬁbres) TxM , x ∈ M . In relativistic kinetic theory (RKT) the phase space
arises out of T M by restriction to future-directed, non-spacelike tangent vectors [9].

Local coordinates xa on M induce local coordinates ξI = (xa, pb) on T M , where pa are the coordinate
components of the vector p = pa∂/∂xa. Any smooth vector ﬁeld on T M can be expressed covariantly
via the anholonomic “connection basis” {Ha, Vb} of horizontal and vertical vector ﬁelds [4]:

Ha =

∂
∂xa − Γb

capc ∂

∂pb ,

Va =

∂
∂pa .

The Lie brackets of the basis vectors are

where Rabcd is the Riemann curvature tensor. The vector ﬁeld

Γ = paHa

has integral curves on T M which are the natural lifts of geodesics on M . Γ is called the geodesic spray
or, in RKT, the Liouville vector ﬁeld.

For a vector ﬁeld Y = Y a(x)∂/∂xa on M , various lifted vector ﬁelds have been deﬁned on T M :

where ∇ is the covariant derivative, and ψ is proportional to ∇aY a in (2.9).

We can also deﬁne the vertical lift of a rank-2 tensor ﬁeld [1]

with a special case being the Euler vector ﬁeld [4]

A →

A = Aa
b

b(x)pbVa ,

∆ =

δ = paVa .

Matter symmetries in RKT have been deﬁned [6] in terms of a vector ﬁeld Y and a skew rank-2 tensor

ﬁeld A on M :

(Y, A) → Y a(x)Ha + Aa

b(x)pbVa ,

A(ab) = 0 ,

where round brackets enclosing indices denote symmetrisation.

A dynamical system on M is deﬁned [2], [3] by a congruence of trajectories on T M . The tangent
vector ﬁeld to these trajectories is the dynamical vector ﬁeld Γ, e.g. (2.5). A dynamical symmetry is a
vector ﬁeld Σ that maps trajectories into trajectories with possibly rescaled tangent vector ﬁeld. Thus
(exp εLΣ)Γ is parallel to Γ, where L is the Lie derivative. Hence

LΣΓ ≡ [Σ, Γ] = −ψΓ ,

(2.13)

for some ψ(x, p), is the condition for Σ to be a dynamical symmetry. The nature of the rescaling depends
on ψ(x, p). If ψ = ψ(x), then the rescaling is constant on each ﬁbre TxM . If ψ = 0, then there is no
rescaling and Σ is said to be a Lie symmetry on T M .

3 Transport lifts

Let Y = d/dσ be a vector ﬁeld on M and Λ a smooth local rule governing the transport of tangent vectors
along the integral curves of Y . Thus any ua at xa(σ) is mapped under Λ to u′a at x′a = xa(σ + ε), with
u′a = Λa(x, u; ε). This deﬁnes curves (xa(σ) , pb(σ)) in T M , with

dxa
dσ

= Y a(x) ,

≡ λa(x, p) =

.

We can deﬁne a vector ﬁeld on T M with integral curves (xa(σ), pb(σ)) given by (3.1). We call this the
transport lift [8] on T M of the vector ﬁeld Y and of the transport rule Λ along Y . The transport lift is
given locally by

The transport lift (3.2) combines the point transformations generated by Y on M with the tangent
vector transformations generated by Λ on M . In general, the transport rule Λ along Y is not deﬁned
purely by tensor ﬁelds on M . However this is the case for an aﬃne transport rule, for which

Λa(x, u; ε) = Ωa

b(x; ε)ub + K a(x; ε).

Thus the aﬃne transport lift (ATL) of (Y, Λ) on M has the form [8]

Y (A,k) = Y a(x)Ha + [Aa

b(x)pb + ka(x)]Va ,

where

It follows that k is a vector ﬁeld on M , whereas ω is not a tensor ﬁeld unless Y = 0. Furthermore, A
as deﬁned by (3.5) is a tensor ﬁeld, and the vertical component in (3.4) therefore transforms covariantly.
The transport rule Λ is thus covariantly determined by A and k.

By (3.4), the integral curves of Y (A,k) satisfy

b(x)pb + ka(x)

b(x) − Γa

bc(x)Y c(x)]pb + ka(x) .

We can rewrite (3.8) as

Dpa
dσ

= Aa

bpb + ka ,

which shows that A and k determine the rate of change of tangent vectors under Λ relative to parallel
transport. In the case k = 0, we get a particularly simple interpretation of A:

for all u along Y . This equation is important for the geometric construction of lifts (see below). The
class of linear transport lifts (LTL’s) arises as the special case ka = 0, and we write

Aa

bub = ∇Y ua or A(u) = ∇Y u ,

Y (A) ≡ Y (A,0) .

LTL’s encompass all previously deﬁned lifts apart from the vertical lift (2.7).

Now from (3.4) we get

αY (A,k) + βZ (B,ℓ) = (αY + βZ)(αA+βB,αk+βℓ) ,

(3.10)

for any scalars α, β on M . (Note that A and B depend, respectively, on Y and Z. In particular, this
means that in general the taking of the aﬃne transport lift is not a linear operation.) Thus the ATL’s
form a linear subspace. Furthermore, (2.2–4) give

Before limiting ourselves to the linear case, we regain the vertical lift (2.7) of a vector ﬁeld:

In order to regain the horizontal lift (2.6) of a vector ﬁeld, we require that the transport rule Λ be
parallel transport along Y for all u. When the transport rule Λ is chosen to be Lie transport (“dragging
along”), we regain the complete lift (2.8):

Y = Y (0) ,

Y = Y (∇Y ) .
e

Thus we are able to regain in a uniﬁed and geometric way, the standard lifts of vectors and rank-2 tensors
via the concept of ATL’s. Using the general Lie bracket relation (3.11), we can easily regain the known
Lie brackets [1]–[4] amongst the three standard vector lifts:

where S(Y, Z)a
but the horizontal lifts do not on a curved manifold. By (3.11), the vertical lifts form an ideal in the
algebra of ATL’s, but the complete lifts do not.

We now show [7] that the LTL’s also include the matter symmetry vector ﬁelds of RKT. Berezdivin and
Sachs deﬁne a matter symmetry as a vector ﬁeld on T M that leaves the distribution function f unchanged.
This vector ﬁeld connects points in T M where the distribution of matter is the same. Geometrically, this
implies that an observer at x with local Lorentz frame F will measure f on the tangent ﬁbre TxM to be
the same as an observer at x′ with Lorentz frame F ′ measuring f ′ on Tx′M . Thus matter symmetries
arise in the class of LTL’s out of the requirement that the transport rule Λ be Lorentz transport along Y .
Hence any vector transforms according to a representation of the Lorentz group SO(1, 3) along Y . Given
an orthonormal tetrad {Ea}, we have Ea · Eb = ηab ≡ diag (−1, 1, 1, 1). Now the tetrad components
of any vector transform as u′a = Λa(u, x; ε) = Ωa
b(x; ε)ub where Ω ∈ SO(1, 3). Thus Ω preserves η.
Diﬀerentiating and noting that Ωa

b(x; 0) = δa

b , we get

ω(ab) = 0 ⇒ A(ab) = 0 ,

(3.20)

where ω is deﬁned by (3.6). This is the condition in (2.12) for Y (A) to be a matter symmetry – or
“Lorentz lift”. The matter symmetries form a Lie algebra, since by (3.12), C is skew if A and B are.

Iwai’s lift (2.9) arises as the LTL which is the lift of conformal Lie transport. However Iwai deﬁnes
his lift for Y a projective collineation or conformal Killing vector, whereas the class of ATL’s generalises
this to any Y :

Y † = Y (∇Y −2ψδ) .

(3.21)

The generalised Iwai lifts form a Lie algebra:

[Y †, Z †] = [Y, Z]† where ψ[Y,Z] = LY ψZ − LZ ψY .

This generalises Iwai’s result [5] to the case of arbitrary Y, Z.

4 Dynamical and matter symmetries

In searching for a dynamical symmetry Σ obeying the condition (2.13) with Γ the geodesic spray (2.5), it
is usually assumed that Σ arises purely from a vector ﬁeld on the base manifold M – for example, Σ =
Y
e
or Y †. Transport lifts open up the possibility of generalising dynamical symmetries to the case where
not only a vector ﬁeld, but also a transport law for tangent vectors, is used to generate transformations
of the dynamical trajectories.
In the case of aﬃne transport laws, this means looking at the ATL’s.
Unfortunately, as we shall show, the dynamical symmetry condition reduces the ATL to a vector lift – in
fact to Y † [8]. At least this gives a foundation to the ad hoc ansatz of Iwai.

We examine now the conditions under which an ATL is a dynamical symmetry. By (2.13) this gives

[Y (A,k), Γ] = −ψΓ ,

Aab = ∇bYa − ψgab .

where Γ is given by (2.5). Then (4.1) implies ka = 0, which is the restriction to the class of LTL’s. A
further implication of (4.1) is that

From (4.2) it is clear that ψ is restricted to ψ = ψ(x), and

LY Γa

bc ≡ ∇c∇bY a − Ra

bcdY d = δa

(b∇c)ψ .

By (4.3), Y is a projective collineation vector [2], [3], and together with (4.2) this means that the ATL
is reduced to Iwai’s projective lift (2.9):

[Y (A,k), Γ] = −ψΓ ⇒ Y (A,k) = Y (∇Y −ψδ,0) = Y † .

Thus we see that any aﬃnely based dynamical symmetry arises from a projective collineation vector.
Furthermore, the ansatz introduced by Iwai in fact arises as the condition for an ATL to be a dynamical
symmetry. Any attempt to generalise Iwai’s ansatz would require a fully nonlinear transport rule Λ.

Matter symmetries provide a diﬀerent, and more physically based, approach to symmetries of particle

motion, but are correspondingly more diﬃcult to analyse. By (2.12), we ﬁnd that [7]

[Y (A), Γ] = (Aa

b − ∇bY a) pb Ha + (cid:0)Ra

bcdY d − ∇cAa

b(cid:1) pbpc Va .

Thus a matter symmetry is more general than a dynamical symmetry, and reduces to the latter only if

Aab = ∇[bYa] , ∇(bYa) = ψgab , LY Γa

bc = 0 .

These conditions imply that Y is a conformal Killing and aﬃne collineation vector, i.e. a homothetic
vector (ψ is constant), and A is the bivector dY .

5 Conclusion

By generalising the concept of lifting point transformations to include tangent vector transport, we have
deﬁned the class of ATL’s on the tangent bundle. The ATL’s include all previous lifts, thus unifying many
results into a single framework, with clear geometric interpretations. The generalisation introduced by
the ATL concept includes in particular the matter symmetries of RKT, and the lifts introduced ad hoc
by Iwai. The projective lift of Iwai is shown to be the unique ATL which is a dynamical symmetry on
(semi-) Riemannian manifolds. The matter symmetries provide a very diﬀerent concept of invariance –
see [7] for a full discussion. They coincide with dynamical symmetries only in the special case that Y is
homothetic and A = dY .

Applications of the ATL formalism beyond RKT are possible. It may also be useful in the study of
symmetries in gauge ﬁeld theories, since Y (A) generates gauge transformations along Y if A is in the
gauge Lie algebra at each point. The formalism could also be generalised to other ﬁbre bundles. For
example, an ATL on the ( r
s ) tensors along Y . With
modiﬁcations, the formalism would also carry through to the tangent bundle of a manifold with torsion.

s M arises when Λ transforms ( r

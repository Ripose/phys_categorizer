Abstract.  Collocated  measurements  of  the  mass  concentrations  of  aerosol  black  carbon  (BC) 

and  composite  aerosols  near  the  surface  were  carried  out  along  with  spectral  aerosol  optical 

depths  (AODs)  from  a  high  altitude  station,  Manora  Peak  in  Central  Himalayas,  during  a 

comprehensive aerosol field campaign in December 2004. Despite being a pristine location in 

the Shivalik Ranges of Central Himalayas, and having a monthly mean AOD (at 500 nm) of 

0.059 (cid:114)0.033 (typical to this site), total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration was in the 

range 15 - 40 (cid:80)g m-3 (mean value 27.1 (cid:114) 8.3 (cid:80)g m-3).  Interestingly, aerosol BC had a mean

concentration of 1.36 (cid:114) 0.99 (cid:80)g m-3, contributed to ~5.0 (cid:114) 1.3% to the composite aerosol mass.

This large abundance of BC is found to have linkages to the human activities in the adjoining 

valley and to the boundary layer dynamics. Consequently, the inferred single scattering albedo 

lies  in  the  range  of  0.87  to  0.94  (mean  value  0.90  (cid:114)  0.03),  indicating  significant  aerosol 

absorption.  The  estimated  aerosol  radiative  forcing  was  as  low  as  –4.2  W  m-2 at the  surface, 

1

+0.7  W  m-2 at  the  top  of  the  atmosphere,  implying  an  atmospheric  forcing  of  +4.9  W  m-2.

Though absolute value of the atmospheric forcing is quite small, which arises primarily from

the very low AOD (or the column abundance of aerosols), the forcing efficiency (forcing per 

unit optical depth) was ~88 W m-2, which is attributed to the high BC mass fraction.

1. Introduction 

The  importance  of  radiative  forcing  of  the  atmosphere  by  aerosols  is  assuming

increasing  importance  in  climate  studies  [Haywood  and  Ramaswamy,  1998;  Jacobson, 2001; 

Ramanathan et al., 2001; Kaufman et al., 2002]. Nevertheless, large uncertainties still persist 

in  this  area,  primarily  due  to  the  large  heterogeneity  in  aerosol  properties  and  scarcity  of 

adequate data. In this context the Asian region assumes importance due to its high population 

density  and  diverse  human  activities.  Numerous  measurements  and  impact  assessments  are 

being reported from this region in the recent years [Moorthy et al., 1999, 2004; Satheesh and 

Ramanathan,  2000;  Ramanathan  et  al.,  2001; Babu  et  al.,  2002;  Seinfeld  et  al.,  2004; 

Pandithurai  et  al.,  2004;  Tripathi  et  al.,  2005].  However,  most  of  these  studies  focused  to 

either  urban/semi-urban  landmass  or  oceans  adjacent  to  densely  populated  coastal  belt. 

Investigations from remote, sparsely inhabited regions have the importance of providing a sort 

of  background  against  which  the  urban  impacts  can  be  compared.  In  this  perspective, 

observations  from  high  altitude  stations  have  a  special  significance  as  the  aerosols  in  this 

region  provide  a  ‘far-field  picture’,  quite  away  from  potential  sources  and  are  more

representative  of  free  troposphere  conditions.  By  free  troposphere,  we  mean  region  largely 

unaffected  by  the  meso-scale  planetary  boundary  layer  dynamics.  The  properties  of  such 

aerosols  will  be  representative  of  a  greater  spatial  extent  too.  Recent  observations  have 

revealed pockets of high aerosol loading / optical depth in the north Indian regions around the 

Ganga basin, particularly during the winter season [Girolamo et al., 2005; Tripathi et al., 2005; 

Jethva  et  al.,  2005]  when  the  prevailing  meteorological  conditions  are  favorable  for 

2

confinement  of  aerosols.  The  topography  of  the  region  with  the  towering  Himalayas  to  the 

north  adds  to  this.  The  low-level  capping  inversion,  particularly  during  winter  periods  of 

highly reduced solar insolation, prevents the dispersion of pollutants.

In  this  paper,  we  report  the  results  of collocated  measurements  of  spectral  aerosol 

optical  depths  (AOD),  mass  and  number  concentrations  of  composite  aerosols,  and  mass

concentration  of  aerosol  black  carbon  (BC)  from  a  high  altitude  station  in  the  central 

Himalayas  during  a  field  campaign,  conducted  from  1st  to  30th  December  2004.  The 

measurements are used to characterize the aerosols and to assess their radiative impacts. The 

implications are discussed. 

2.    Observational Details and Data 

2.1. Site Description and Synoptic Meteorology 

The campaign was carried out from Manora Peak (29.4o N; 79.5o E, 1950 m AMSL), 

Nainital, located in the Shivalik ranges of Central Himalayas (marked as 1 in Fig. 1). Owing to 

its large elevation this site is mostly above the boundary layer particularly during winter season 

(December to February), when the temperature drops very low (as low as 5° C) and the thermal

convection  is  weak.  As  such,  this  region  is  well  above  the  convective  boundary  layer,  the 

height of which is typically <~800 m during this season [ eg., Moorthy et al., 2004; Tripathi et 

al.,  2005].  .  The  prevailing  meteorology  during  December  comprises  of  a  synoptic  westerly 

circulation with a weak northerly component (see Fig. 2), low ambient temperature, and low to 

moderate relative humidity (RH), and scanty rainfall. The mean wind speed, temperature and 

RH  characteristics  during  the  campaign  period,  as  measured  at  the  site  using  an  automatic

weather station, are shown in Fig. 3. The winds are quite weak (2 to 4 m s-1); mean temperature

varies between 8 to 15° C and RH varies between 50 to 70%. The sky was generally clear and 

cloud-free except for three days. No rainfall occurred during the campaign period. Even though 

occurrence of fog conditions were reported in the later half of December in the north Indian 

3

plains,  lying  200  kms  due  south  (of  Manora  Peak),  and  persisted  for  several  days,  no  fog 

occurred at the observational site on any of the campaign days. The topography of the region is 

shown  in  Fig.  4  and  vegetation  index  in  Fig.  5.  The  sharply  peaking  topography  of  the 

Himalayan ranges is clearly seen from Fig. 4. Locations at an aerial distance of < 40 kms due 

south and south west of the location are at very low elevation (<200 m AMSL) and merge with 

the  vast  plain  level  of  the  Ganga  basin,  while  to  the  north  and  north  east  we  have  the  tall 

Himalayan ranges. The plains are densely populated and include several urban areas like New 

Delhi, Kanpur (marked as 2 in Fig.1), Lucknow within aerial distance of 200 kms. However, 

the observation site is well below the snow line and has thick vegetation as can be seen from

Fig. 5.

2.2. Experimental details and Data

During  the  experimental  campaign  simultaneous  and  collocated  measurements  of 

spectral AODs ((cid:87)a(cid:79)), BC mass concentration (MB), mass loading of composite aerosols (TSP) 

near-surface (MT), number concentration of composite aerosols in the size range from 0.3 to 20 

(cid:80)m, and meteorological parameters were carried out respectively using a 5-channel Microtops 

Sun photometer (Solar Light Co., USA), Aethalometer (Magee Scientific, USA model AE-21), 

a  high  volume  air  sampler  (Envirotech  Inc.,  model  APM  430),  an  optical  particle  counter 

(OPC, model 1.018 of Grimm Aerosol Technik, GmbH, Germany), and an automatic weather 

station (Campbell Scientific Inc., Canada). The Aethalometer uses a continuous filtration and 

optical transmission technique to  yield  MB in near real time. It aspirates ambient air (from 5 

meter  above  ground  level)  using  its  inlet  tube  and  pump.  The  BC  mass  concentration  is 

estimated by measuring the change in the transmittance of its quartz filter tape, on to which the 

particles impinge. More details on the instrument and principle of measurement are available 

elsewhere [Hansen et al., 1984, Hansen, 2003]. The Aethalometer was operated at a standard 

4

flow rate of 3.3 litres min-1 and a time base of 5 min. As the standard flow rate correspond to a 

temperature of 293 K and pressure of 1017 hPa, the instrument measured values of MB were 

corrected for the changes in the pump speed at the high altitude (mean pressure of 850 hPa and 

temperature  of  12(cid:113)C  during  the  observation  period)  following  the  considerations  given  in 

Moorthy  et.  al.  [2004].  The  mass  loading  (MT)  of  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP)  was 

measured using the high volume air sampler.  Since, the aerosol concentrations at the site were 

very low, as for most of the cases, the HVS was operated about 16 hours to obtain one sample.

The  OPC  is  a  portable,  lightweight,  battery  operated  optical  particle  counter,  which 

classifies particles into 15 size channels in the diameter range between 0.3 to 20 (cid:80)m (Model 

No 1.108 of Grimm Aerosol Technik, GmbH, Germany; http://www.grimm-aerosol.com) and 

estimates the number concentration. It works on the principle of optical counting of particles, 

by  detecting  the  pulses  of  radiation  scattered  (at  90°)  by  individual  particles  in  the  sampling

flow.  A  diode  laser  is  used  as  the  light  source.  The  pulse  height  discriminator  sets  the  size 

range  and  the  number  of  pulses  corresponds  to  the  number  of  particles.  The  OPC  has  been 

operated in the count mode and provided number concentration (NC). An averaging time of 5 

min  was  used  to  obtain  the  number  concentration.  An  isokinetic  probe  connected  to  the 

instrument inlet aspirated the ambient air at a rate of 1.2 litre per minute. The high dynamic

range  of  the  instrument  enables  measurements from  clean  to  polluted  environments.    This 

instrument was mounted in its environmental housing, which maintained the inlet air sample at 

a constant RH level.

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) were estimated using Microtops II Sunphotometer which 

is  a  hand-held  instrument  having  5-channels  with  central  wavelengths  at  380,  440,  500,  675 

and  870  nm  and  FWHM  (full  width  at  half  maximum)  of    ~6  -  10  nm.  The  methodology  of 

data acquisition with Microtops II and precautions during measurements are described in detail 

by Porter et al. [2001], Morys et al. [2001] and Ichoku et al. [2002].

3. Results and Discussion 

3.1. Aerosol Optical Depth

          Spectral aerosol optical depth ((cid:87)a(cid:79)) measurements were made regularly during periods of 

unobscured solar conditions and more than 650 data sets were obtained during the campaign

period. These are averaged in daily ensembles to obtain the daily mean. The temporal variation 

in  daily  mean  AOD  at  500  nm  is  shown  in  Fig.  6(a)  where  the  vertical  bars  represent  the 

standard deviations. The optical depths were very low, with (cid:87)a(cid:79) at 500 nm being less than 0.1 

on all days, except on December 01, 18 and 21; thereby indicating the prevalence of the clean 

environment.  These  AODs  are  considerably  lower  than  the  values  (0.2  to  0.34)  reported  for 

winter 2003, by Ramana et al. [2004], based on observations from four high altitude sites in 

Nepal, due southeast of Manora Peak in the Himalayan ranges. This is typical to this location 

during  the  winter  season  (December  to  February)  as  has  been  reported  earlier  [Sagar  et  al.,

2004].  The  monthly-mean  AOD  at  500  nm  was  0.059  (cid:114)0.033.  The  mean  AOD  spectrum  for 

December  2004  is  shown  in  Fig.  6(b).  By  evolving  a  least  square  fit  to  the  individual  AOD 

spectra (on log-log scale) and the Angstrom parameters ((cid:68) and (cid:69)) are evaluated. The values of 

(cid:68) varied between 0.4 to 1.2 on different days while (cid:69) varied from 0.02 to 0.05. The mean value 

of (cid:68)  for  December  2004  was  0.09.    The  regional  distribution  of  the  monthly  mean  AOD  (at 

550 nm) derived from MODIS (onboard Terra satellite) is shown in Fig. 7. The picture clearly 

shows low AODs over the Himalayan regions and regions of enhanced AODs (by an order of 

magnitude) on the adjoining valley. This spatial variation is not a simple artifact of the altitude 

alone.  If  we  assume  an  exponential  variation  with  altitude  for  the  aerosol  extinction  with  a 

typical  scale  height  of  2  km  [Chami  and  Santer,  1998; Levy  et al., 2004], then the  observed 

mean value of 0.059 for AOD at 500nm at ~2km altitude of the Manora peak will translate to a 

value of ~0.16 for sea level. Rather, if we consider a much lower scale height of ~1.5 km for 

the aerosols for the winter season (in view of the largely reduced convection), the AOD still 

6

would be only 0.22 for the sea-level and this value is considerably lower than those reported 

for several continental sites in India (remote and semi-urban) for this season, where the AODs 

typically  are  ~0.3  to  0.5  at  500nm.  The  relevance  of  this  spatial  heterogeneity  in  AOD  has 

implications  to  the  aerosol  properties  over  Manora  peak  as  will  be  seen  in  the  following

sections.

3.2. Concentrations of Composite and Black Carbon aerosols

Daily average values of BC concentration show considerable variation ranging from 0.85 

to 2.6 (cid:80)g m-3. In Fig. 8(a) we show the monthly mean diurnal variation of MB while the day-to-

day  variations  are  given  in  Fig.  8(b).  The  monthly  mean  BC  concentration  was  found  to  be 

1.36 (cid:114)0.99 (cid:80)g m-3, which is very low in comparison to other urban locations in India (Fig. 1) 

as  reported  by  Babu  et  al.  [2002]  for  Bangalore  (BLR);  Babu  and  Moorthy  [2002]  for 

Trivandrum  (TVM);  Lata  and  Badrinath  [2003]  for  Hyderabad  (HYD);  and  Tripathi  et  al.

[2005]  for  Kanpur  (KNP).  This  value  of  MB,  though  less  than  the  values  reported  at  these 

locations  in  India  (TVM,  HYD,  BLR,  KNP,  marked  in  Fig.1);  is  still  quite  high  when  we 

consider  the  elevated  nature  of  the  station  and  its  remoteness.  Part  of  this  BC  could  be 

transported  from  the  valley  below,  by  the  boundary  layer  dynamics,  while  the  rest  would  be 

the prevailing values and those resulting from the local activities, which though is limited. The 

monthly mean diurnal variation at Manora Peak shows lower values of MB during night and 

morning  hours  and  increases  slowly  thereafter  approaching  its  highest  level  late  in  the 

afternoon  (around  sun  set)  and  then  decreases  more  rapidly  to  reach  the  low  value  around 

midnight. Diurnal minimum occurs at ~7:00 am. The amplitude of the diurnal variation is ~ 3; 

from  ~0.75  to  2.5  (cid:80)g  m-3  and  is  comparable  to  that  seen  at  other  continental  locations  [eg., 

Babu and Moorthy, 2002].  However, the nature of the diurnal variation observed at the low 

altitude  locations  were  different  from  (or  in  fact  opposite  to)  that  observed  at  Manora  peak. 

For  example, Babu and Moorthy [2002] have reported  high  BC  values  at night and morning

7

hours,  which  gradually  decreased  as  the  day  advances,  attaining  its  minimum  level  around 

16:00 local time and recovered into the night. On the contrary, at Manora Peak we see a late 

afternoon high and a midnight minimum. It may be recalled that based on BC measurements

from  a  high  altitude  station  (1250  m  AMSL),  Bhugwant  et  al    [2001]  have  reported  diurnal 

variations of BC very similar to that seen in this study and is attributed to the boundary layer 

dynamics  which  brings  up  the  polluted  emissions  from  the  underlying  valley  regions  to  this 

high-altitude location.

To the northeast of the Manora Peak is the hilly terrain of the Central Himalayan ranges 

(>2.0 km AMSL), having insignificant anthropogenic activities. On the other hand to the south 

and  southwest  are  densely  populated  valley  regions  (at  a  mean  elevation  of  ~300  m),  and 

located  at  an  aerial  distance  of  ~10  km.  During  nighttime,  the  shallow  nocturnal  boundary 

layer acts as a capping inversion [Stull, 1999], confining the emissions from these regions well 

below the mountain peak and as a result the BC concentration at Manora peak, is mainly due to 

the  residual  layer  (of  the  preceding  day).  After  the  sunrise,  the  heating  of  the  land  surface 

results  in  setting  up  of  convective  motions,  which  gradually  raise  the  inversion  to  higher 

altitudes [Vladimir and Eischinger, 2004], leading to increased vertical mixing that brings up 

the air with high aerosol concentration to higher levels. This would result in the increase in the 

concentration  of  anthropogenic  emissions  at  the  peak  as  is  observed  in  the  present  study.  It 

would be so, not only for the BC concentration, but also for the number/ mass concentrations 

of  the  composite  aerosols.  This  is  examined in  Fig.  9,  where  we  have  plotted  the  average 

diurnal  variation  of  the  number  concentration  of  the  composite  aerosols  (recorded  by  the 

OPC),  for  December  2004.  The  striking  similarity  with  Fig  8  (a)  is  apparent.  These 

observations indicate that the vertical transport of aerosols from the densely populated valley 

regions  (which  also  have  high  AODs  as  seen  in  Fig.  7)  by  the  evolving  boundary  layer, 

significantly modifies the concentration of aerosols at the peak. As a result, the afternoon (AN) 

concentrations of aerosol species (when the boundary layer has fully evolved) become higher 

8

compared  to  the  forenoon  (FN)  concentrations  (when  the  boundary  layer  is  shallow).  To 

examine this, we have separated MB and NC into forenoon and afternoon (FN and AN) parts of 

the  day  and  obtained  separate  averages  for  each  day.  The  day-to-day  variations    of  these, 

shown in Fig. 10, very clearly indicate consistently higher concentrations in the afternoon. The 

mean values (separately for FN and AN) for the month are listed in Table 1 for MB and NC.

As far as the aerosol absorption is concerned, more than the mass concentration (MB) of 

BC, it is the mass mixing ratio (FBC) (which is the ratio of the mass concentration of BC to that 

of the composite aerosol  = MB /MT) is important. Atmospheric forcing efficiency of aerosols 

is  shown  to  be  strongly  dependent  on  FBC  [Babu  et  al.,  2004].  From  the  simultaneous

measurements of the mass concentrations of composite and BC aerosols (respectively MT and

MB) using the HVS and Aethalometer respectively, the BC mass fraction FBC was estimated for 

each day. MT was found to be in the range of 15 to 40 (cid:80)g m-3, with a mean value of 27.1 (cid:114)8.3

(cid:80)g m-3. The average share of BC to composite aerosol mass concentration at Manora peak was 

found  to  be  ~  5.0  (cid:114)  1.3%.    It  is  much  lower  than  the  values  reported  for  Kanpur  as  7-15% 

[Tripathi et al., 2005] and for Trivandrum ~12% [Babu and Moorthy, 2002] during the month

of December. The evaluated FBC at Manora Peak is lower than even the lowest values reported 

by various investigators during the INDOEX program [Satheesh et al., 1999; Babu et al., 2002;

Venkataraman et al., 2002].

Investigations  during  ACE-2,  INDOEX  and  TARFOX    [Novakov  et  al.,  2000;

Ramanathan et al., 2001; Satheesh et al., 2002] have shown BC to contribute in the range of 

10  to  15%  to  the  composite  aerosol  mass,  whereas  its  mixing  ratio  reported  over  tropical 

western Pacific was as high as 25% (with BC mass of ~40 (cid:80)g m-3) [Liley et al., 2002]. During 

the  field  campaign  at  an  urban  site,  Bangalore  (13°N,  77°E,  960  m  msl)  in  India,  large 

concentration  of  BC  was  observed;  both  in  absolute  terms  (~6  (cid:80)g  m3)  and  fraction  to 

composite  aerosol  mass  (~11%).  From  an  extensive  and  continuous  measurement  of  aerosol 

9

BC  from  a  coastal  location,  Trivandrum,  adjacent  to  the  Arabian  Sea,  Babu  and  Moorthy 

[2002]  observed  that  BC  mass  fraction  to  the  total  showed  large  seasonal  variations.  During 

winter (similar to the present study period) BC contributes to ~11% of the aerosol mass (4 to 6 

(cid:80)g m-3 in absolute terms) while during monsoon season the BC fraction is reduced to 3 to 4% 

(1 to 2 (cid:80)g m-3 in absolute terms). Measurements during 1996-97 close to down town Helsinki, 

have shown BC concentration in the range of 1.2 to 1.5 (cid:80)g m-3 with an average of 1.3 (cid:80)g m-3

and its average contribution to aerosol mass was 19% [Pakkanen et al., 2000]. Examining in 

the light of the above the average concentration of BC and its mass fraction to the composite

aerosols at Manora Peak are lower than those reported at several locations for similar season; 

nevertheless the values are rather higher than what would be expected for such an elevated and 

remote location.

3.3. Single Scattering Albedo and Aerosol Radiative Forcing

The magnitude of the climate forcing by aerosol particles is strongly dependent upon 

the  aerosol  single  scattering  albedo  (SSA),  which  is  the  ratio  of  the  scattering  to  extinction 

coefficients. The aerosol characteristics estimated in earlier sections were used to estimate SSA 

and direct short wave radiative forcing. For this, we have followed an approach of using the 

available  observations  as  anchoring  points  in  a  standard  continental  average  aerosol  model,

which  is  fine-tuned  to  match  the  measurements  [see  Moorthy  et  al.,  2005  for  details].  The 

optical and radiative properties, estimated from this model were then fed to a radiative transfer

model. This method has been extensively used for estimating radiative forcing due to aerosols 

[for eg., Satheesh et al., 1999; Podgorny et al., 2000; Conant et al., 2003; Markowicz et al.,

2003; Moorthy  et  al.,  2005]. Based  on  observations  of  aerosol  optical  depth,  Angstrom

wavelength  exponent,  total  aerosol  mass  and  BC  mass,  we  have  adopted  the  continental 

average model of Hess et al [1998] and used the BC mass fraction, aerosol optical depths and 

Angstrom exponent as the anchoring points. The other components of the model were sulphate 

10

and  transported  dust.  The  measured  BC  was  used  to  represent  soot.  The  number  density  of 

each of these species was adjusted, while maintaining the mass fraction of BC to the observed 

value so that the spectral AODs of the modelled aerosols (assuming spherical aerosols and are 

assumed externally mixed) agreed well with the mean values from the measurements and the 

value of (cid:68) agreed within 5%. Because of this closure (with spectral AOD) and anchoring the 

BC mass fraction, the initial assumption of the model will not have any significant impact on 

the estimated forcing, as has been pointed out by Satheesh and Srinivasan [2005]. The spectral 

AOD  thus  estimated  from  the  aerosol  model is  shown  by  dotted  line  in  Fig.  6b.  The  rms

deviation  between  the  experimentally  estimated  AOD  spectrum  and  the  model  simulation  is 

0.006,  indicating  a  good  agreement  between  the  two.  The  inferred  SSA  was  in  the  range  of 

0.87  to  0.94  with  a  mean  value  of  0.9  (cid:114)  0.03.  This  value  is  significantly  higher  than  that 

reported  by  Babu  et  al.  [2002]  for  Bangalore  (~0.78)  and  Tripathi  et  al.  [2005]  for  Kanpur 

(~0.76). From sun-sky radiometer measurements, Pandithurai et al. [2004] have estimated the 

SSA  over  an  urban  site  (Pune)  to  be  ~0.81  for  the  same  season  of  2001-02.  Based  on  near-

surface measurements in the Himalayan region (in Nepal), Ramana et al. [2004] reported the 

SSA  in  the  range  of  0.7  to  0.9  for  winter  of  2004.  Based  on  the  observations  over  tropical 

Indian  Ocean,  Satheesh  et  al  [1999]  have  reported  a  value  of  0.9  during  pre-INDOEX 

campaign in 1998. Ramanathan et al. [2001] reported a value of 0.86 (cid:114)0.08 for the west coast 

of India and 0.89(cid:114)0.02 for Arabian Sea, and 0.95 to 0.99 for Southern Indian Ocean. The value 

of  SSA  at  Manora  Peak  is  comparable  to  the  highest  value  reported  for  Himalayan  region 

based on surface measurements and to that obtained over polluted oceanic regions, but is lower 

than that for the pristine environment (southern Indian Ocean).

The  aerosol  optical  properties  (single  scattering  albedo  and  phase  function  thus 

estimated  following  the  above  procedure)  along  with  the  measured  spectral  AODs  and 

Angstrom wavelength exponent were used to estimate the short wave (0.25 to 4 (cid:80)m), aerosol 

11

radiative  forcing  by  incorporating  in  a  Discrete  Ordinate  Radiative  Transfer  (RT)  model

developed by University of Santa Barbara (SBDART) [Ricchiazzi et al., 1998 for details]. The 

methodology used to estimate radiative forcing from measured aerosol properties is available 

extensively in the literature [Satheesh et al., 2002; Moorthy et al., 2005]. The estimated aerosol 

radiative forcing at the surface was as low as –4.2 W m-2 and the corresponding atmospheric

forcing was +4.9 W m-2 (Fig. 11). The overall uncertainty in the estimated forcings, due to the 

small  deviations  in  the  simulations  and  uncertainties  in  the  surface  reflectance  values  used 

(from MODIS data), works out to be ~15 to 20%.

Clear-sky  aerosol  surface  forcing  reported  was  about  -26  W  m-2  for  Atlantic  Ocean 

during  TARFOX  [Hignett  et  al.,  1999]  and  -29  W  m-2  for  tropical  Indian  Ocean  during 

INDOEX  [Podgorny  et  al.,  2000;  Satheesh  and  Ramanathan,  2000].  Using  measurements

during 1996 cruise of ORV Sagar Kanya and island experiments, Jayaraman et al. [1998] and 

Conant [2000] reported comparable values for tropical Indian Ocean. The TOA forcing over 

Indian  Ocean  was  -10  W  m-2;  comparable  to  the  value  of  ~-9  W  m-2  over  north  Atlantic 

[Satheesh and Ramanathan, 2000; Bergstrom and Russell, 1999]. Using collocated data from

the visible IR scanner (VIRS) and CERES (TRMM) satellite [Christopher et al., 2000] made

observational  estimates  of  short  wave  TOA  aerosol  forcing  as  -68  W  m-2  in  1998  during  a 

biomass-burning  episode  in  Central  America.  During  1985  biomass  burning  over  South 

America,  regional  aerosol  radiative  forcing  values  were  estimated  (using  satellite  data)  and 

were in the range of -25 to -34 W m-2 [Christopher et al., 1998]. Aerosol radiative impact at 

the  surface  was  studied  using  AERONET  data  in  Brazil;  Saharan  dust  in  Cape  Verde;  and 

urban-industrial pollution in Creteil, near Paris, France, and near Washington, D. C [Kaufman

et al., 2002]. The measured 24-h average aerosol impact on the solar flux at the surface per unit 

optical  depth  was  -80  W  m-2  in  these  sites,  almost  independent  of  the  aerosol  type:  smoke,

dust, or urban-industrial pollution [Kaufman et al., 2002]. A field experiment was conducted to 

quantify aerosol direct radiative forcing in the southeastern United States (North Carolina) and 

12

at an adjacent valley site during June 1995 to mid-December 1995. The mean cloud-free 24-h 

aerosol  forcing  at  the  TOA  (at  the  surface)  for  highly  polluted,  marine  and  continental  air 

masses are estimated to be -8 (cid:114) 4 (-33 (cid:114) 16), -7 (cid:114) 4 (-13 (cid:114) 8), and -0.14 (cid:114) 0.05 (-8 (cid:114) 3) W m -2,

respectively.  Based  on  investigations  from  Nepal  Ramana  et  al.  [2004]  have  observed  a 

surface radiative forcing of –25 W m-2 for the same season of 2003. Compared to the above, 

the aerosol radiative forcing at Manora Peak is significantly lower. Nevertheless, the forcing

efficiency is quite large (~88 W m-2) and is comparable to that over several polluted regions 

suggesting that type of aerosol over Manora Peak have a large efficiency for forcing, but the 

absolute forcing is low due to their low abundance in the column.

4. Conclusions 

1. A comprehensive campaign to characterize the properties of aerosols was conducted at 

a  high  altitude  region  in  the  Central  Himalayas  during  winter  2004.  Columnar  AODs 

were generally very low with a mean value of 0.059 (cid:114)0.033 at 500 nm, which is typical 

for this remote, high altitude location. 

2. The estimated value of (cid:68) ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 with a mean value of 0.9.

3. The  concentrations  of  BC  as  well  as  composite  aerosols  showed significant diurnal

variations, with an afternoon peak and low around mid-night; the amplitude of the diurnal

variation was ~3. The afternoon peak is attributed to the lifting up of pollutants from the 

densely populated valley region, adjoining the peak, by the convective eddies. The monthly

mean concentrations (of composite  aerosols  and  BC)  are  higher  by  a  factor  of  ~2  in  the 

afternoon, as compared to the forenoon. 

4. The inferred single scattering albedo was in the range of 0.87 to 0.94 with a mean value 

of 0.9 (cid:114) 0.03.

5. The estimated aerosol radiative forcing at the surface was as low as –4.2 W m-2 and the 

corresponding  atmospheric  forcing  was  +4.9  W  m-2.  Aerosol  radiative  forcing  at 

13

Nainital  was  found  to  be  much  lower  compared  to  those  observed  over  low  altitude 

sites in the Indo-Gangetic plain and southern India.

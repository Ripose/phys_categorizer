Inconsistencies in the current description of the thermodynamics of solid phase are exposed.  The 

physics represented by the pressure, the work function, and the internal energy is fundamentally 

different in gas and solid phases.  These thermodynamic quantities cannot be used 

interchangeably for these two phases.  The self-consistent thermodynamic description of the 

solid phase requires a homogeneous model in which both the system and the surrounding have 

the same phase.  The thermodynamic equations for solid-solid system have been derived. 

1.  Introduction 

The gas laws of Boyle and Charles and Gay-Lussac can be combined into a single equation, 

which is called the equation of state [EOS].  The EOS for ideal gasses can be written. 

nRT =

pV

where n is the number of moles, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, p is the 

pressure, and V is the volume.  The gas constant can be written as the product of the Avogadro 

number [

AN ] and the Boltzmann constant [ Bk ] therefore

When the gas phase changes to solid then the relationship between the quantities of EOS 

becomes more complicated and two new thermodynamic parameters are introduced.  The 

function between temperature and volume is characterized by the volume coefficient of

It is generally assumed that beside the introduction of the bulk modulus and the volume 

coefficient of expansion no additional change is required when a phase of a system changes from 

gas to solid and that the rest of the thermodynamic equations, work function, state functions can 

be used without modification for solid phase.  This widely held consensus would be considered 

in details.

where q is the heat, supplied to or taken away from the system, w is the mechanical work, done 

by or on the system, and  Vc  is the molar heat capacity at constant volume.  The internal energy 

is a state function.  In a closed system the path taken from the initial to the final state should not 

affect the internal energy change between the initial and the final conditions.  Following different 

path between the initial and final states of a solid phase system and calculating the internal 

energy changes for both paths leads to different internal energy values (Figure 1a). 

Another example signaling problems in solid-state thermodynamics is shown in Figure 1b).  If a 

system is heated up constant volume then mechanical work should not be done on or by the 

system.  The mechanical energy of the system should remain the same

The outlined inconsistencies signal that there are problems with the current thermodynamic 

description of the solid phase. 

3.  Differences between Gas and Solid Phases 

In solid phase the function between the temperature and volume is described by the volume 

coefficient of expansion while the function between the volume and the pressure is described by 

the bulk modulus.  The introduction of the volume coefficient expansion and the bulk modulus 

does not cover all the changes resulting from the phase change.  The additional differences 

induced by the phase change of the system are the followings. 

3.1  Physics of the Pressure  The pressure in gas phase represents the collision density of the 

atoms/molecules, while in solid phase the pressure is the result of the elastic resistance of the 

3.2  Relationship between the Pressure and the Temperature  The collision density is the 

function of the average energy of the atoms.  At macroscopic level the temperature represents the 

average energy of the atoms.  In gas phase; therefore, the temperature is the function of pressure 

and visa versa as described by the EOS.  In solid phase the elastic deformation changes the shape 

of the potential well.  The change of the shape of the potential and the vibrational energies of the 

atoms are independent from each other.  Consequently the temperature is independent from the 

pressure in solid phase.  This independence can be easily demonstrated by heating up a system at 

zero pressure.  If free expansion allowed then no matter how much heat is added to the system 

pressure will not be generated.  The lack of function between these two quantities is supported 

by the lack of conversion factor between the pressure and the temperature in solid phase. 

3.3 Work Function  The mechanical work in gas phase is calculated as the product of the 

pressure and volume change.

Subscript g and s are used for gas and solid phase respectively. 

3.4  Relationship between the Work Function and the Temperature  In gas phase the 

mechanical work is the product of the pressure and volume change.  Both of these quantities are 

the function of temperature.  The mechanical work therefore is also the function of the

The amount of heat stored by the system is the function of the temperature.  Since the 

temperature is the function of the mechanical work therefore function has to be exist between the 

internal energy and the total mechanical energy of the system.

(15) 

3.6  Storage of the Mechanical Energy  In gas phase the mechanical energy of the system is 

stored through the occupation of the space from the surrounding.  In solid phase the mechanical 

energy is stored by the system as elastic energy.  The internal energy contains only thermal 

energy in gas phase.  In solid phase both the thermal energy and the mechanical work are 

included in the internal energy.

(16) 

The listed additional differences between gas and solid phase are not incorporated into the 

volume coefficient of expansion and bulk modulus.  The different physics behind the pressure, 

the work function and the internal energy results that these thermodynamic quantities are 

incompatible and that they cannot be used interchangeably in gas and solid phases.  If the 

surrounding and the system has different phase then the energies has to be counted separately by 

using the appropriate work function and internal energy for both of the phases.  Self-consistent 

description of a system requires a homogenous phase model thus the system and the surrounding 

should have the same phase.  The outlined inconsistencies in the thermodynamics of solids can 

be eliminated by exclusively using the solid phase thermodynamic equations for describing the 

state of the system and by assuming a solid-solid phase thermodynamic model. 

 

 

4.  Thermodynamic Description of the Solid-Solid System 

Maintaining constant pressure or volume in a solid-solid system requires constrains on the 

temperature of the surrounding.  Constant pressure can be maintained by temperature 

equivalence between the system and the surrounding.  If the temperature of the system changes 

then temperature of the surrounding has to change in the same manner in order to maintain the 

same pressure.  The constant volume of the system can be maintained by fixing the temperature 

of the surrounding.  Ideal conditions are assumed and the developing extra pressure of the system 

will not cause the deformation of the surrounding.  If the temperature of the system is lower than 

surroundings then negative pressure is produced. 

4.1  Constant Temperature  The volume of solids incorporates the initial volume 

]V[
0

 at 

zero pressure and temperature, and the volume change caused by the temperature and/or the 

pressure.  The volume at a given pressure and temperature can be calculated in two steps.  In 

each step one of the variable allowed to change while the other one held constant.

4.2  Constant Pressure  In a solid-solid system maintaining the same temperature for the 

system and the surroundings can provide constant pressure.  Since the temperature of the 

surrounding and the system is the same the volume expansion of the system and the surrounding 

is identical.  The identical expansion of the two volumes maintains the same pressure. 

The expansion of the system occurs at constant pressure therefore the expanded part of the 

volume is compressed.  The energy related to this compressed part of the expansion is minor and 

can be ignored.  In order to give a complete description of the solid phase the work related to the 

expansion is calculated in the appendix.  The compression work resulting from the thermal 

expansion is then

where  (

)psdw  is practically zero.  Equation 34 is consistent with the state function of the internal 

energy and gives the same internal energy difference between any two initial and final state 

regardless of the path followed. 

The heat and mechanical energies are independent from each other in solid phase.  If a system 

is compressed then the work done on the system and the increase of the stored elastic energy in 

the system will be exactly the same.  This energy equivalency indicates that the elastic energy 

would not transfer to heat or vibrational energy.  It can be assumed that this is true in reverse and 

heat would not transfer to elastic energy.  If this theoretical prediction is correct then when a 

solid undergoes adiabatic changes the temperature of the system should not be affected by the 

changes of the pressure or/and the volume.  The entirely independent nature of the heat and 

elastic energy in solid phase indicates that it would make more physical sense to keep record of 

these thermodynamic quantities independently instead of adding them up as internal energy. 

In this study from the conventional thermodynamic potentials only the internal energy has 

been derived for solid phase.  The current form of the rest of the state functions, enthalpy, 

Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy can be used only for gas phase.  The adoption of 

these state functions to solid phase requires further research. 

 

 

6.  Conclusions 

It has been demonstrated that there are inconsistencies in the current thermodynamic description 

of solid phase.  The problems are arising from the fact that not all of the physical differences 

between the gas and solid phase have been covered by the introduction of bulk modulus and 

volume coefficient of expansion.  Additionally a self-consistent thermodynamic description of a 

system requires using a homogenous model by assuming the same phase for the system and the 

surrounding. 

Using a solid-solid phase model the basic thermodynamic equations has been derived for solid 

phase systems.  In the equations it was assumed that both the isothermal bulk modulus and the 

volume coefficient of thermal expansion are constant.  This assumption is valid only within a 

limited temperature and pressure range.  For wider ranges the affect of pressure and temperature 

on these physical parameters has to be taken into consideration.

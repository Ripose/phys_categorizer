Abstract.  Investigation  of  organic  molecular  films  by  a  method  Raman  of  a  spectroscopy  is 
carried out. It is shown, that values of frequencies of lines in a spectrum of the lattice oscillations of 
the  molecular  films  are  depressed  in  comparison  with  values  of  frequencies  of  similar  lines  in  a 
monocrystal.  Intensity  of  padding  lines  will  increase  in  a  spectrum  of  films.  Allocation  of  an 
impurity in a film of an organic mixed crystal nonuniform. Examinations are lead by the example of 
a p-dibromobenzene and the mixed crystal a p-dichlorobenzene / p-dibromobenzene.

For  study  of 

these  problems 
investigation  of  a  Nanocrystallic  film

This  method  has  been  chosen,  as 
spectrums of the lattice oscillations are 
rather sensitive to structural change and

 As objects of research molecular 
crystals  a  p-dibromobenzene  and  a 
solid  solution  p-dichlorobenzene  /p-

are  good

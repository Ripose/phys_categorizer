Abstract 
 
Linac-ring type colliders will open new windows for both 
energy frontier and particle factories. Concerning the first 
direction,  these  machines  seem  to  be  a  sole  way  to  TeV 
scale  in  lepton-hadron  collisison  at  constituent  level.  An 
essential  advantage  of  the  linac-ring  type  lepton-hadron 
colliders  is  the  possibility  of  the  construction  of  γp,  γA 
and  FELγ-A  colliders  based  on  them.  Today,  eRHIC, 
THERA  (TESLA  on  HERA)  and  Linac*LHC  can  be 
considered as realistic candidates for future lepton-hadron 
and photon hadron colliders. When it comes to factories, 
one  can  reach  essentially  higher  luminosities  comparing 
to standard ring-ring type machines. For example, L=1034  
cm-2s-1 can be achieved for phi and charm-tau factories. In 
this  presentation  we  briefly  discuss  the  parameters  and 
physics search potential of the linac-ring type machines.  
 

1 INTRODUCTION 

is  very 

 
There are two well-known ways to reach TeV scale c.m. 
energies  at  constituent  level:  the  ring-ring  type  proton-
proton colliders and the linear e+e- colliders (including γe 
and  γγ  options  [1]).  Recently  two  more  methods  have 
been added to the list, namely: the ring type (cid:181)+(cid:181)- colliders 
[2]  and  the  linac-ring  type  ep  and  eA  colliders  [3] 
(including  γp, γA and FELγA options [4-6]). 
 
The investigation of physics phenomena at extreme small 
x  but  sufficiently  high  Q2 
important  for 
understanding  the  nature  of  strong  interactions  at  all 
levels  from  nucleus  to  partons.  At  the  same  time,  the 
results  from  lepton-hadron  collidres  are  necessary  for 
adequate  interpretation  of  physics  at  future  hadron 
colliders.  Today, 
type  ep  machines  and 
additional  options  based  on  them  seem  to  be  the  main 
way  to  TeV  scale  in  lepton-hadron  and  photon-hadron 
collisions.  
 
On  the  other  hand,  the  idea  of  colliding  of  the  electron 
beam from a linac with the positron beam stored in a ring 
is  widely discussed during the last decade in the context 
of high luminosity particle facrories, namely, B factory, φ 
factory, c-τ factory  etc.

2  THERA BASED COLLIDERS 
 
The  opportunity  to  collide  electron  and  photon  beams 
from  TESLA  with  proton  and  nucleus  beams  in  HERA 
were taken into into account by choosing the direction of 
TESLA tangential to HERA [7]. 
 
Main  parameters  of  three  possible  options  for  THERA 
based ep collider are presented in Table 1.

A  brief  account  of  some  SM  physics  topics  (structure 
functions,  hadronic  final  states,  high  Q2  region  etc.)  is 
presented below [7]: 
-  The  extension  of  kinematic  range  down  to  x~10-6 
allows access to the high parton-density domain and its 
detailed exploration in the deep-inelastic regime. 

-  The  measurement  of  proton  structure  functions  at 
THERA  will  be  essential  for  determining  quark  and 
gluon  distributions  in  the  proton  in  an  unexplored 
kinematic region. 

-  The study of forward-going jets at THERA is expected 
to  reveal  the  mechanism  for  the  evolution  of  QCD 
radiation at low x. 

-  The 

total  cross  sections  for  charm  and  beauty 
production are expected to increase by factors of three 
and five, respectively, as compared to HERA. 

-  THERA  will  operate  beyond 

the  electroweak 
unification  scale  and  is  thus  a  trully  (cid:147)electroweak 
interaction machine(cid:148). 

-  THERA  will  probe  physics  beyond  the  Standard 

Model. 

 
Refering  for  details  to  [4]  and  [8]  let  us  note  that 
luminosity  of  γp  collisions  is  approximately  one  half  of 
the  luminosity  of  ep  collisions  (photon  beam  is  obtained   
due to Compton backscattering of laser beam on electron 
beam  from  TESLA).  A  partial  list  of  physics  goals  of 
THERA based γp collider is following [9,10]:

For  the  THERA  based  eA  collider,  the  main  limitation 
comes  from  fast  emittance  growth  due  to  intra  beam 
scattering,  which 
proportional 
(Z2/A)2(γA)-3.  Nevertheless,  sufficiently  high  luminosity 
can  be  achieved  at  least  for  light  nuclei.  For  example, 
LeC=1.1⋅1029cm-2s-1  for  collisions  of  300  GeV  energy 
electron  beams  and  Carbon  beam  with  nC=8⋅109  and 
N=1.25π⋅mrad⋅mm  [11].  This  value  corresponds  to 
εC
Lint⋅A≈10pb-1  per  working  year  (107  s)  needed  from  the 
physics point of view [12].  
 
In our opinion,  Aγ  collider is the most promising option 
of  the  TESLA⊗HERA  complex,  because  it  will  give 
unique  opportunity  to  investigate  small  xg  region  in 
nuclear medium. Indeed, due to the advantage of the real 
γ spectrum heavy quarks will be produced via γg fusion at 
characteristic

3  LinacxLHC BASED COLLIDERS 
 
The  center  of  mass  energies  which  will  be  achieved  at 
differenet options of this machine are an order larger than 
those at HERA and ~3 times larger than the energy region 
of  THERA  and  LEP*LHC.  In  principle,  luminosity 
values  are  ~7  times  higher  than  those  of  corresponding 
options  of    HERA  complex  due  to  higher  energy  of 
protons.  
 
Center  of  mass  energy  and  luminosity  for  ep  option  are 
TeV  and  Lep  =  1032  cm-2s-1,  recpectively; 
[13] 
and  additional  factor  of  3-4  can  be  provided  by  the 
(cid:147)dynamic(cid:148) focusing scheme [14] . A further increase will 
require  cooling  at  injector  stages.  This  machine,  which 
will  extend  both  the  Q2-range  and  x-range  by  more  than 
two  order  of  magnitude  comparing  to  those  explored  by 
HERA,  has  a  strong  potential  for  both  SM  and  BSM 
research.  Few  examples  are:  the  discovery  limit  for  the 
TeV;  the  discovery 
first  generation  leptoquarks  is

limit  for  SUSY  particles  is

analyses at  LHC [15]; excited electron  will be copiously

In  the  case  of    γp  option,  the  advantage  in  spectrum  of 
backscattered  photons  and  sufficiently  high  luminosity 
(for  details  see  [4,13]),  Lγp  =  1032  cm-2s-1  at    z  =  0,  will 
clearly  manifest 
searching  of  different 
in 
phenomena.  
The physics search potential of γp colliders is reviewed in 
[9]. The γp option will essentially enlarge the capacity of 
the  Linac*LHC  complex.  For  example,  thousands  of  di-
jets with pt >500 GeV and hundred thousands of single W 
bosons will be produced, hundred millions of   bb and  cc  
pairs  will  give  opportunity  to  explore  the  region  of 
extremely small xg (~10-6-10-7) etc. Concerning the BSM 
physics: 
-

In  the  case  of  LHC  nucleus  beam,  IBS  effects  in  main 
ring are not crucial because of large value of γA. The main 
principal limitation for  heavy nuclei coming  from beam-
beam  tune  shift  may  be  weakened  using  flat  beams  at 
collision 
that 
LeA⋅A>1031cm-2s-1  can  be  achieved  at  least  for  light  and 
medium nuclei [11]. For electron-carbon and electron-Pb 
collisions,  one  has  LeC⋅A=1031cm-2s-1  and    LePb⋅A=1.2 
⋅1030cm-2s-1  ,  correspondingly.  This  machine  will  extend 
both the Q2-range and   x-range by more than two orders 
of  magnitude  with  respect  to  the  region,  which  can  be 
explored by HERA based eA collider. 
 
In the case of γA collider, limitation on luminosity due to 
beam-beam  tune  shift  is  removed  in  the  scheme  with 
deflection of electron beam after conversion [4]. As  it is 
shown in [13], LγC⋅A=0.8⋅1031cm-2s-1 and LγPb⋅A=1030cm-
2s-1  at  z  =  5m.  Center  of  mass  energy  of  Linac*LHC 
based  γA  collider  corresponds  to  Eγ  ~PeV  in  the  lab 
system.  At  this  energy  range,  cosmic  ray  experiments 
have  a  few  events  per  year,  whereas  γ-nucleus  collider 
will  give  few  billions  events.  This  machine  has  a  wide 
research  capacity.  Especially,  the  investigation  of  gluon 
distribution  at  extremely  small  xg  will  give  a  crucial 
information for QCD in nuclear medium. 
 
5.  LINAC-RING TYPE PARTICLE 

FACTORIES 

 
5.1. Phi Factory 
 
It  is  well  known  that,  center  of  mass  energy  and 
luminosity are two important parameters from the point of 
view  of  particle  physics.  In  order  to  make  a  linac-ring 
type  φ factory feasible, its luminosity should exceed 1033    
cm-2s-1. We have presented sets of parameters for a linac-
ring  type  φ  factory  in  [18].  About  4⋅1011  events  per 
working year (107 s) is expected. For main parameters and 
rates  of  φ  decays  at  a  linac-ring  type  φ  factory  see  ref. 
[19].  
 
5.2. Charm Factory 
 
Recently  CLEO-c  [20]  has  been  approved  in  order  to 
explore  the  charm  sector  starting  early  2003.  Expected 
machine  performance  will  be  L=3⋅1032cm-2s-1  at 
s =
773.
GeV.  We  present  proposed  parameters  for 
that 
linac-ring 
type  charm  factory  [21]  and  show 
L=1033÷34cm-2s-1  can  be  achieved.  Expected  numbers  of 
)3( SΨ
per working  year is about 1010. Let us  mentioned 
that  DD mode is the dominant one for 
decays. An 
additional advantage of the proposed charm factory is the 
asymmetrc  kinematics.  This  feature  will  be  important  in 
0 DD
investigations of  
oscillations and CP-violation in 
charmed particle decays.

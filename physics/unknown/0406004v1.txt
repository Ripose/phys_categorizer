Reciprocal relations correlate fairly accurately 
a great variety of experimental results.  Nevertheless, 
the concepts of statistical fluctuations, and 
microscopic reversibility – the bases of the accepted 
proof of the relations by Onsager – are illusory and 
faulty, and contradict the foundations of the science 
of thermodynamics.  The definitions, postulates, and 
main theorems of thermodynamics are briefly 
presented.  It is shown beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that thermodynamics is a nonstatistical science that 
applies to all systems (both macroscopic, and 
microscopic, including systems that consist either of 
only one structureless particle, or only one spin), to 
all states (both thermodynamic or stable equilibrium, 
and not stable equilbrium), and that includes entropy 
as a well defined, intrinsic, nonstatistical property of 
any system in any state, at any instant in time.  In the 
light of this novel conception of thermodynamics, we 
find that reciprocal relations result from a well known 
mathematical theorem, to wit, given a well behaved 
 then  ∂2f /∂ai∂aj ≡ 
analytic function

∂2f /∂aj∂ai for i, j = 1, 2, …, m.

INTRODUCTION 

On the occasion of the commemoration of the 

 
 
100th birthday of Nobel Prize winner Lars Onsager, 
we honor him for his pioneering attempts to justify 
"reciprocal relations in irreversible processes" [1, 2] 
by using statistical classical mechanics, and what he 
called "the concept of microscopic reversibility", a 
concept that includes the consideration of past, 
present, and future times, and averages of 
spontaneous statistical fluctuations beginning and

PACS number(s): 05.70.Ln, 03.65.-w, 05.30.-d 

ending in a thermodynamic or stable equilibrium 
state.  His work has stimulated many related studies  
by Meixner [3-6], Nobel Prize winner Ilya Prigogine 
[7], Nobel Prize winner Peter Dennis Mitchell [8], de 
Groot and Mazur [9], Haase [10], Katchalsky and 
Curran [11], and many other scientists.  In these 
studies, reciprocal relations are fairly accurately 
verified by experimental results obtained from 
thermoelectric devices, electrolytic cells, and other 
processes.  In fact, some of these relations were 
empirically recognized even before Onsager provided 
his theoretical explanation.  This experimental 
verification is viewed by practically all scientists and 
engineers as one incontrovertible proof of the validity 
of statistical classical mechanics, and microscopic 
reversibility. 

Specifically, Einstein – the Man of the 20th 

Despite the satisfactory experimental 
verification of reciprocal relations, it behooves us to 
reexamine their theoretical justification in the light of 
our current understandings of the concept of time, 
and of the science of thermodynamics. 
 
century – says [12]: "For us loyal physicists, this 
separation between past, present, and future holds 
only the value of an illusion, tenacious as it may be".  
And yet, this separation plays a key role in the 
evaluation of cross-correlations of the statistical 
fluctuations presumed by Onsager, fluctuations which 
temporarily reduce the entropy without compensation 
and, therefore, violate the laws of thermodynamics.  
Said differently, fluctuations violate the definition of 
an equilibrium state that is globally stable, a 
definition which is more general than that used by 
Poincaré and Liapunov in mechanics for local 
stability. 

Again, we have the perennial question, best 

 
posited by Feynman.  In trying to understand entropy 
and irreversibility, he considers the mixing of white 
and black molecules, and comments [13]: "Gradually 
 the whites worm their way, by accident, across into 
the space of the blacks, and the blacks worm their 
way, by accident, into the space of the whites.  
Clearly, this is an irreversible process in the real 
world, and ought to involve an increase in the 
entropy."  The conclusion about the entropy of 
mixing is correct and real.  However, the cause of this 
reality is not the mixing of the kinds of molecules 
considered by Feynman because he tacitly assumes 
that each molecule has a fixed spatial shape, and if 
this assumption is valid then there is no entropy of 
mixing [14], the process is reversible.  The cause of 
irreversibility – the entropy of mixing – is the change 
in volume in which each colored molecule is 
confined, and the ensuing change of the quantum 
mechanical spatial shape of each molecule [15, 16]. 
 
Again, a different but pervasive answer which 
is shared by practically all colleagues that profess and 
nurture the science of statistical classical mechanics is 
given by Maxwell.  He says [17]: "In dealing with 
masses of matter while we do not perceive the 
individual molecules, we are compelled to adopt what 
I have described as the statistical method of 
calculation, and to abandon the strict dynamical 
method, in which we follow every motion by the 
calculus".  But is it possible to have irreversible 
processes just because we do not know how to solve 
numerically difficult problems?  And conversely, 
would the concept of irreversibility disappear from 
our textbooks, our analyses, and the myriad of 
irreversible processes that we encounter in practice, if 
our analytical and computational skills improve so 
much that we can follow every motion by the 
calculus?  Our answer to each of these rhetorical 
questions is an unqualified no.  Our answer is so 
emphatic because in the case of mixing perfect gases, 
the spontaneous entropy increase is based on the 
behavior of each individual molecule and, therefore, 
can be followed precisely by the calculus alluded to 
by Maxwell [14]. 
 
To be sure, the statistical method of 
calculation yields many numerically correct answers, 

Even though tremendous progress has been 

in the same sense that the geocentric model of our 
solar system yields many numerically correct 
answers.  However, the effects of irreversibility are 
real, and do not depend on our ability to solve 
difficult mathematical problems, in the same sense 
that the stationary electronic energy eigenstates of a 
heavy element in the periodic table are real despite 
our difficulties to calculate the precise energy 
eigenvalues, and energy eigenfunctions. 
 
made over the past two and a half centuries in 
improving the efficiency of various processes, that is, 
in reducing the spontaneous generation of entropy, 
irreversibility continues to result in irreparable 
exhaustion of energy resources, and to cause the 
degradation of the earth's environment in ways that 
are energetically costly and hard to curtail, and 
perhaps impossible to sustain. 
In response to dilemmas such as discussed in 
 
the preceding remarks, a small group of faculty and 
students at MIT has conceived of and elaborated on 
two intimately interrrelated and trailblazing 
theoretical interpretations of physical phenomena. 
 
One consists in recognizing that what 
Feynman calls [13] "the laws of physics" are correct 
but incomplete.  Specifically, the laws of quantum 
mechanics that involve only wave functions or 
projectors are incomplete because they apply only to 
processes that are unitary in time, and therefore are 
reversible.  But not all reversible phenomena are 
unitary, and not all phenomena are reversible.  We 
have addressed this issue by developing a 
nonstatistical unified quantum theory of mechanics 
and thermodynamics [18] that completes the "laws of 
physics", and that includes a nonlinear equation of 
motion [19, 20].  In the unified theory, Feynman's 
laws of physics are a special case, zero entropy 
physics, and the Onsager reciprocity and dispersion - 
dissipation relations are derived without resort to 
statistical physics, and microscopic reversibility [21]. 
In sharp contrast to what is presented in 
 
practically every textbook on physics and/or 
thermodynamics, our second regularization of 
physical phenomena consists of a novel, non-quantal 
exposition of thermodynamics as a nonstatistical 
science that applies to all systems (both macroscopic, 

 

2

and microscopic, including systems that consist of 
either only one structureless particle,or only one 
spin), and to all states (both thermodynamic or stable 
equilibrium, and not stable equilibrium) [22].  An 
important proven theorem (not law) of this 
nonstatistical exposition is the existence of entropy as 
a well defined (without ambiguities, circular 
arguments, and the concepts of heat and temperature) 
intrinsic, nonstatistical property of any system, in any 
state, at any instant in time.  A brief summary of this 
novel exposition is given in the Appendix. 
 
does not involve statistics, fluctuations, and 
microscopic reversibility, in what follows we derive 
the reciprocal relations by using the same flow 
processes, the same linear approximations, and the 
same experimental results as all previous 
investigators, and the fact that a well behaved analytic 
function

∂2f /∂ai∂aj ≡ ∂2f /∂aj∂ai for i, j = 1, 2, …, r.

General remarks 

From the practical standpoint, the most 

 
 
important and interesting applications of 
thermodynamics involve systems passing through 
nonequilibrium states.  For example, an energy 
conversion system, a chemical reactor, and a living 
entity and its life support processes are each a system 
in a nonequilibrium state evolving in time.  In 
general, a rigorous analysis of a system passing 
through nonequilibrium states is cumbersome 
because it requires both a very large number of 
independent variables – a very large number of 
independent properties at each instant in time – and 
the complete equation of motion alluded to earlier. 
Inspired by the success of numerical 
 
correlations of experimental data by means of 
Fourier's law, Fick's law, and Ohm's law, we 
approximate nonequilibrium states by the following 
model. 
(i) We consider a one-dimensional system A that 
experiences no chemical reactions, has a fixed 

 

 

volume, and is in a steady state (a state that does not 
vary in time) as a result of interactions with two 
reservoirs I and II as shown in Figure 1, where τ is the 
inverse absolute temperature, and µi the chemical or 
electrochemical potential of the ith neutral or  
electrically charged constituent, respectively, for i = 
1, 2, …, r.

Figure 1.  Schematic representation of system A 
maintained in a steady state by two reservoirs. 
 
(ii) We define a reservoir as a system that, to a very 
high degree of accuracy, satisfies the following 
specifications: (a) It passes through stable equilibrium 
states only; (b) In the course of finite changes of state 
at constant or varying values of its energy, amounts 
of constituents, and parameters (such as volume 
and/or an applied electric field), it departs 
infinitesimally from the condition of mutual stable 
equilibrium with a duplicate of itself that experiences 
no such changes; (c) At constant values of the 
amounts of constituents and parameters of each of 
two reservoirs initially in mutual stable equilibrium, 
energy can be transferred reversibly from one 
reservoir to the other at the expense of infinitesimal 
and negligible effects on any other system. 
(iii) As a result of (i) and (ii), all time dependent 
changes occur only in reservoirs I and II.  But 
because each reservoir passes only through stable 
equilibrium states, all properties and all time 
dependent changes can be interrelated by using the 
fundamental relation, namely, the function

E, amounts of r constituents n1, n2,…, nr denoted by 
the vector n, and the two parameters, volume V and 
electrostatic field  ε .  The function 
 is 
shown to be [22] a well behaved analytic function of 
each of its independent variables 
therefore it is differentiable to all orders with respect 
to each of these variables.  In particular, it is the 
function used for the rigorous definitions of 
temperature T = 1/τ, chemical or electrochemical 
potential µi, and pressure p by the relations [22]

(iv) Because system A is in a steady state, we can 
partition it into contiguous laminas of differential 
thickness dx, and assert that each lamina is in a steady 
state as shown in Figure 2.  It is noteworthy, that 
partitioning is possible if and only if the system is 
simple.  The definition, and characteristics of simple 
systems are discussed in [22].

(v) Capitalizing on the excellent results that are

steady state between two local reservoirs, as shown in 
Figure 3.

that is, we prove the reciprocal relations without 
resorting to statistical fluctuations, the concepts of 
past, present, and future, and the idea of microscopic 
reversibility which are not valid for nonzero entropy 
physics of any system (both macroscopic, and 
microscopic), in any nonzero entropy state (both 
stable equilibrium, and not stable equilibrium). 

 
CONCLUSION 

For the first time in the long history of the 

 
 
problem, reciprocal relations are not derived as 
consequences of the statistical classical mechanics 
interpretation of thermodynamics, fluctuations, and 
microscopic reversibility.  They are proven on the 
basis of a rigorous, unambiguous, and noncircular 
exposition of thermodynamics as a nonstatistical 
theory of physics that applies to all systems, and all 
states, and that includes entropy as an intrinsic 
property of the constituents of a system, in the same 
sense that rest mass is an intrinsic property of the 
constituents of a system. 
In this presentation, we discuss reciprocal 
 
relations of a system that experiences no chemical 
reactions.  Thermodynamic derivations of conditions 
for chemical equilibrium and of Onsager reciprocal 
relations for chemical reactors are discussed in a 
companion paper [23]. 

 

 

 

APPENDIX: A NEW EXPOSITION OF 
THERMODYNAMICS 
 
A.1 Basic concepts 
 

A.1.1  General remarks 

 

Many scientists and engineers have expressed 

 
concerns about the completeness and clarity of the 
usual expositions of thermodynamics.  For example, 
in the preface of his book Concepts of 
Thermodynamics, Obert writes [24] "Most teachers 
will agree that the subject of engineering 
thermodynamics is confusing to the student despite 
the simplicity of the usual undergraduate 
presentation."  Again, Tisza states [25] "The 
motivation for choosing a point of departure for a 
derivation is evidently subject to more ambiguity than 
the technicalities of the derivation….In contrast to 
errors in experimental and mathematical techniques, 
awkward and incorrect points of departure have a 
chance to survive for a long time." 
In response to numerous such concerns, 
 
Gyftopoulos and Beretta [22] have composed an 
exposition in which all basic concepts of 
thermodynamics are defined completely, without 
ambiguities and circular arguments in terms only of 
the mechanical concepts of space, time, and force or 
inertial mass. 
 
principles is system (types and amounts of 
constituents, forces between constituents, and 
external forces or parameters); properties; states; first 
law (without energy, work, and heat); energy 
(without work and heat); energy balance; 
classification of states in terms of time evolutions; 
stable equilibrium states; second law (without 
temperature, heat, and entropy); generalized available 
energy; entropy of any state (stable equilibrium or 
not) in terms of energy and generalized available 
energy, and not in terms of temperature and heat; 
entropy balance; fundamental relation for stable 
equilibrium states only; temperature, total potentials 
(chemical and/or electrochemical), and pressure in 
terms of energy, entropy, amounts of constituents and 
parameters for stable equilibrium states only; third 

The order of introduction of concepts and

We define general thermodynamics or simply

systems (both macroscopic, and microscopic), all

states, and states that are not stable equilibrium), and 
involve no statistical probabilities (neither statistical 
classical mechanics nor statistical quantum 
mechanics). 
 
A.1.2  Definition 
 
 
thermodynamics as the study of motions of physical 
constituents (particles and radiations) resulting from 
externally applied forces, and from internal forces 
(the actions and reactions between constituents).  This 
definition is identical to that given by Timoshenko 
and Young about mechanical dynamics [26].  
However, because of the second law, we will see that 
the definition encompasses a much broader spectrum 
of phenomena than mechanical dynamics. 
 
A.1.3 Kinematics: conditions at an instant in time 
 
 
the terms system, property, and state so that each 
definition is valid without change in any paradigm of 
physics, and involves no statistics attributable to lack 
of information about any aspect of a problem in 
physics, and/or consideration of numerical and 
computational difficulties.  The definitions include 
innovations.  To the best of our knowledge, they 
violate no theoretical principle, and contradict no 
experimental results. 
A system is defined as a collection of 
 
constituents, subject to internal forces, that is, forces 
between constituents, and external forces, that is, 
forces that depend only on coordinates of the 
constituents and not on coordinates of constituents of 
the source of the force.  Everything that is not 
included in the system is the environment.  For these 
definitions to be meaningful, the system must be both 
separable from and uncorrelated with any entity in its 
environment. 

In kinematics we give verbal definitions of 

For a system with r constituents, subject to 

By themselves, the values of the amounts of 

external forces described by s parameters, we denote 
the amounts by the vector n = {n1, n2, …, nr}, and the 
parameters by the vector β = {β1, β2,…, βs}.  One 
parameter may be volume, β1 = V, another may be an 
externally determined electric field, β2 equal to the 
electric field.  At any instant in time, the amount ni of 
constituent i and the parameter βj of external force j 
have specific values.  We denote all such values by n 
and β with or without additional subscripts. 
 
constituents and of the parameters at an instant in 
time do not suffice to characterize completely the 
condition of the system at that time.  We also need 
the values of a complete set of linearly independent 
properties at the same instant in time.  A property is 
defined as an attribute that can be evaluated at any 
given instant in time (not as an average over time) by 
means of a set of measurements and operations that 
are performed on the system and result in a numerical 
value – the value of the property.  This value is 
independent of the measuring devices, other systems 
in the environment, and other instants in time. 
 
of the amounts of all the constituents, the values of all 
the parameters, and the values of a complete set of 
linearly independent properties encompass all that 
can be said about the system at a given instant in 
time, and about the results of any measurements that 
may be performed on the system at that same instant 
in time.  We call this complete characterization of the 
system at any instant in time the state of the system.  
This definition of state, without change, applies to all 
paradigms of physics. 
 
A.1.4  Dynamics: changes of state in time 
 
 
either spontaneously due to the internal forces or as a 
result of interactions with other systems, or both.  The 
relation that describes the evolution of the state of an 
isolated system – spontaneous changes of state – as a 
function of time is the equation of motion.  Certain 
time evolutions obey Newton's equation which relates 
the force F on the constituents of the system to their

Other evolutions obey the Schrödinger equation, that 
is, the quantum-mechanical equivalent of Newton's 
equation.  Other experimentally observed time 
evolutions, however, do not obey either of these 
equations.  So the equations of motion that are widely 
known are correct but incomplete.  The discovery of 
the complete equation of motion that describes all 
quantum mechanical evolutions in time is a subject of 
research and controversy at the frontier of science –
one of the most intriguing and challenging problems 
in quantum physics [18-20, 27-30].  To the best of 
our knowledge, the only complete equations, that 
satisfy all known requirements are given in Refs. [19, 
20]. 
 
features of the complete equation of motion are 
captured by the consequences of the first and second 
laws of thermodynamics discussed in the next 
sections. 
 

Two of the most general and well-established 

A.2 Energy 
 
A.2.1  The first law, energy and energy balance 

Energy is a concept that underlies our 

 
 
understanding of all physical phenomena, yet its 
meaning is subtle and difficult to grasp.  It emerges 
from a fundamental principle known as the first law 
of thermodynamics. 
The first law asserts that any two states of a 
 
system may always be the initial and final states of a 
weight process.  Such a process involves no net 
effects external to the system except the change in 
elevation between z1 and z2 of a weight, that is, solely 
a mechanical effect.  Moreover, for a given weight, 
the value of the expression M g (z1 – z2) is fixed only 
by the end states of the system, where M is the mass 
of the weight, and g the gravitational acceleration. 
 
One theorem of this law is that every system 
A in any state A1 has a property called energy, with a 
value denoted by the symbol E1.  The energy E1 can 
be evaluated by a weight process that connects A1 and 
a reference state A0 to which is assigned an arbitrary 
reference value E0 so that 
 
E1 = E0 – M g (z1 – z0)   

(A-1) 

 

 

Energy is shown to be an additive property, 

 
that is, the energy of a composite of two or more 
identifiable subsystems is the sum of the energies of 
the subsystems.  Moreover, it is also shown that 
energy has the same value at the final time as at the 
initial time if the system experiences a zero-net-effect 
weight process, and that energy remains invariant in 
time if the process is spontaneous.  In either of the 
last two processes, z2 = z1 and E (t2) = E (t1) for time 
t2 greater than t1, that is, energy is conserved.  Energy 
conservation is a time-dependent result.  In Ref. [22], 
this result is obtained without use of the complete 
equation of motion. 
 
result of interactions.  Denoting by 
 the amount 
of energy transferred from the environment to system 
A in a process that changes the state of A from A1 to 
A2, we can derive the energy balance.  This 
derivation is based on the additivity of energy and 
energy conservation, and reads  
 
(
 
In words, the energy change of a system must be 
accounted for by the energy transferred across the 
boundary of the system.

A.3 Available Energy 

Because in quantum theory the number of 

 
A.3.1  Types of states 
 
 
independent properties of a system is infinite even for 
a system consisting of a single particle with a single 
translational degree of freedom – a single variable 
that fixes the configuration of the system in space –
and because most properties can vary over a range of 
values, the number of possible states of a system is 
infinite.  The discussion of these states is facilitated if  
they are classified into different categories according 
to evolutions in time.  This classification brings forth 
many important aspects of physics, and provides a 
readily understandable motivation for the 
introduction of the second law of thermodynamics. 
 
The classification consists of unsteady states 
(they change in time as a result of interactions), 

 

8

Starting either from a nonequilibrium state or 

steady states (they do not change in time despite 
interactions), nonequilibrium states, and equilibrium 
states.  An equilibrium state is one that does not 
change in time while the system is isolated—a state 
that does not change spontaneously.  An unstable 
equilibrium state is an equilibrium state that may be 
caused to proceed spontaneously to a sequence of 
entirely different states by means of a minute and 
short-lived interaction that has either an infinitesimal 
effect or a zero net effect on the state of the 
environment.  A stable equilibrium state is an 
equilibrium state that can be altered to a different 
state only by interactions that leave net effects in the 
environment of the system.  These definitions are 
identical to the corresponding definitions in 
mechanics but include a much broader spectrum of 
states than those encountered in mechanics.  The 
broader spectrum is due to the second law discussed 
later. 
 
from an equilibrium state that is not stable, 
experience shows that energy can be transferred out 
of the system, and affect a mechanical effect without 
leaving any other net changes in the state of the 
environment.  In contrast, starting from a stable 
equilibrium state, experience shows that energy 
cannot be transferred out of the system while 
achieving only the mechanical effect just cited.  This 
impossibility is one of the most striking consequences 
of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. 
 
A.3.2  The second law and generalized adiabatic 
availability 
 
 
The existence of stable equilibrium states is 
not self-evident.  It was recognized by Hatsopoulos 
and Keenan [31] as the fundamental theoretical 
underpinning of all correct statements of the second 
law in practically every textbook on either 
thermodynamics or physics.  In essence, these 
statements are theorems arising from the concept of  
stability.  Gyftopoulos and Beretta [21] concur with 
this recognition, and state the second law as follows 
(simplified version): Among all the states of a system  
with a given value of energy, and given values of the 
amounts of constituents and the parameters, there 
exists one and only one stable equilibrium state. 

The existence of stable equilibrium states for 
 
the conditions specified and therefore the second law 
cannot be derived from the laws of mechanics.  
Within mechanics, the stability analysis yields that 
among all the allowed states of a system with fixed 
values of amounts of constituents and parameters, the 
only globally stable equilibrium state is that of lowest 
energy.  In contrast the second law avers the 
existence of a much larger class of globally stable 
equilibrium states in addition to the states 
contemplated by mechanics. 
The existence of stable equilibrium states for 
 
various conditions of matter has many theoretical and 
practical consequences.  One consequence (theorem) 
is that, starting from a stable equilibrium state of any 
system, no energy is available to affect a mechanical 
effect while the values of the amounts of constituents 
and parameters of the system experience no net 
changes.  This consequence is often referred to as the 
impossibility of the perpetual motion machine of the 
second kind (PMM2).  In many expositions of 
thermodynamics, it is taken as the statement of the 
second law.  In our exposition, it is only one theorem 
of both the first and the second laws. 
 
Another consequence is that not all states of a 
system can be changed to a state of lowest energy by 
means of a mechanical effect.  This is a 
generalization of the impossibility of a PMM2.  In 
essence, it is shown that a novel important property 
exists which is called generalized adiabatic 
availability.  The generalized adiabatic availability of 
a system in a given state represents the optimum 
amount of energy that can be exchanged between the 
system and a weight in a weight process.  Like 
energy, this property is well defined for all systems 
and all states, but unlike energy it is not additive. 
 
A.3.3  Generalized available energy 
 
 
captures the important features of generalized 
adiabatic availability, Gyftopoulos and Beretta 
introduce a special reference system, called a 
 
reservoir (see definition in Sec. 2.1), and discuss the 
possible weight processes that the composite of a 
system and a reservoir may experience.  Thus they

value generalized available energy, denote it by 
and show that it is additive.  It is a generalization of 
the concept of motive power of fire introduced by 
Carnot.  It is a generalization because he assumed that 
both systems of the composite acted as reservoirs 
with fixed values of their respective amounts of 
constituents and parameters, whereas Gyftopoulos 
and Beretta do not use this assumption.

A process is reversible if both the system and its

sequence of restoring states need not, and in 
practically all processes is not a retrace of the initial 
sequence.  Excellent examples of these facts are the 
reversible or irreversible processes involved in a 
Carnot cycle.  In addition, such considerations bring 
forth the question of whether there is an arrow of 
time, but the discussion of this question is beyond the 
scope of this presentation. 
 
available energy are defined for any state of any 
system, regardless of whether the state is steady, 
unsteady, equilibrium, nonequilibrium, or stable 
equilibrium, and regardless of whether the system has 
many degrees of freedom or one degree of freedom, 
or whether the size of the system is large or small.

It is also noteworthy that the laws of

Eq. A-4 be always true.  They simply stipulate one of 
the consequences of either reversibility or 
irreversibility. 
 

A.4 ENTROPY 

R

 
A.4.1  Definition 
 
A system A in any state A1 has many 
 
properties.  Two of these properties are energy E1 and 
generalized available energy 
1Ω  with respect to a 
given auxiliary reservoir R.  These two properties 
determine a third property called entropy, denoted by 
the symbol S.  It is a property in the same sense that 
energy is a property, or momentum is a property.  For 
a state A1, an auxiliary reservoir R, a reference state 
R
A0, with energy E0, generalized available energy 
0Ω , 
and a reference entropy S0, the entropy S1 of A1 is 
defined by the relation

where cR is a well-defined positive constant that 
depends on the auxiliary reservoir R only.  Entropy S 
is shown to be independent of the reservoir, that is, S 
is a property of system A only, and R is auxiliary.  
The reservoir is used only because it facilitates the 
definition of S.  It is also shown that S can be 
assigned absolute values that are non-negative, and 
that vanish for all the states encountered in classical 
or conventional quantum mechanics. Because both 
energy and generalized available energy are additive, 
entropy is also additive. 
 
A.4.2  Reversible and irreversible processes 
 

Because energy and generalized available 

energy satisfy relations (A-3) and (A-4), the entropy 
defined by Eq. (A-5) remains invariant in any 
reversible adiabatic process of A, and increases in any 
irreversible adiabatic process of A.  These 
conclusions are valid also for spontaneous processes,

The entropy created as a system proceeds 

and for zero-net-effect interactions.  The latter 
features are known as the principle of nondecrease of 
entropy.  Both a spontaneous process and a zero-net-
effect interaction are special cases of an adiabatic 
process of system A. 
 
from one state to another during an irreversible 
process is called entropy generated by irreversibility.  
It is positive.  The entropy nondecrease is a time-
dependent result.  In the novel exposition of 
thermodynamics [22], this result is obtained without 
use of the complete equation of motion. 
 
Like energy, entropy can be transferred 
between systems by means of interactions.  Denoting 
by  ←AS
systems in the environment to system A as a result of 
all interactions involved in a process in which the 
state of A changes from state A1 to state A2, we derive 
a very important analytical tool, the entropy balance, 
that is, 
 
(
S
 
where 
irrS  is non-negative.  A positive 
represents the entropy generated spontaneously 
within system A in the time interval from t1 to t2 
required to affect the change from state A1 to state A2.  
Spontaneous entropy generation within a system 
occurs if the system is in a nonequilibrium state 
because of the natural tendency of the system to reach 
an equilibrium or a stable equilibrium state. 
 
The dimensions of S depend on the 
dimensions of both energy and cR.  It turns out that 
the dimensions of cR are independent of mechanical 
dimensions, and are the same as those of temperature.  
Temperature is defined later. 
 
A.4.3  Properties of stable equilibrium states 
 
It is shown that among the many states of a 
 
system that have given values of energy E, amounts 
of constituents n, and parameters β, the entropy of the 
unique stable equilibrium state that corresponds to 
these values is larger than that of any other state with

classical mechanics are theorems of F = ma. 
 

4.5 CHARACTERISTICS OF ENTROPY 

 
 
From the discussions in the preceding section 
and our knowledge of classical thermodynamics, we 
conclude that any expression that purports to 
represent the entropy S of thermodynamics must have 
at least the following eight characteristics or, 
equivalently, conform to the following eight criteria. 
(1) S must be well defined for every system (large or 
small), and every state (stable equilibrium or not 
stable equilibrium). 
(2) S must be invariant in all reversible adiabatic 
processes, and increase in any irreversible adiabatic 
process. 
(3) S must be additive for all systems and all states. 
(4) S must be non-negative, and vanish for all the 
states encountered in mechanics. 
(5) For given values of energy, amounts of 
constituents, and parameters, one and only one state 
must correspond to the largest value of S. 
(6) For given values of the amounts of constituents 
and parameters, the graph of entropy versus energy of 
stable equilibrium states must be concave and 
smooth. 
(7) For a composite C of two subsystems A and B, the 
expression must be such that the maximization of S of 
C [criterion no. (5)] yields identical thermodynamic 
potentials (for example, temperature, total potentials, 
and pressure) for all three systems A, B, and C. 
(8) For stable equilibrium states, S must reduce to 
relations that have been established experimentally 
and that express the entropy in terms of values of 
energy, amounts of constituents, and parameters, such 
as the relations for ideal gases. 

It is noteworthy that, except for criteria (1) 

and (4), we can establish the remaining six criteria by      
reviewing the definition of entropy of classical 
thermodynamics. 
 

4.6 COMMENT 

The concept of entropy introduced here 

 
 
differs from and is more general than what is 
presented in practically all textbooks on 
thermodynamics and / or physics.  It does not involve 
the concepts of temperature and heat; it is not 
restricted to large systems; it applies to macroscopic 
as well as microscopic systems, including a system 
with one spin, or a system with one particle with only 
one (translational) degree of freedom; it is not 
restricted to stable (thermodynamic) equilibrium 
states; it is defined for both stable equilibrium 
(thermodynamic equilibrium) and not stable 
equilibrium states because energy and generalized 
available energy are defined for all states; and most 
certainly, it is not statistical – it is an intrinsic 
property of matter.  These assertions are valid 
because here the postulates or laws of 
thermodynamics from which the concept of entropy 
originates do not involve the concepts of temperature 
and heat, are not restricted either to large systems or 
to stable equilibrium states or both, and are not 
statistical.  To emphasize the difference and 
generality of the concept, we recall contrary 
statements by Meixner [32]: "A careful study of the 
thermodynamics of electrical networks has given 
considerable insight into these problems and also 
produced a very interesting result: the nonexistence of 
a unique entropy value in a state which is obtained 
during an irreversible process,…, I would say I have 
done away with entropy"; by Callen [33]: "It must be 
stressed that we postulate the existence of the entropy 
only for equilibrium states and that our postulate 
makes no reference whatsoever to nonequilibrium 
states", and by Lieb and Yngvason [34] "Once again, 
it is a good idea to try to understand first the meaning 
of entropy for equilibrium states – the quantity that 
our textbooks talk about when they draw Carnot 
cycles.  In this article we restrict our attention to just 

 

12

those states".  It is noteworthy, that even from their 
totally unjustified limited perspective, Lieb and 
Yngvason [35] introduce 16 axioms to explain their 
second law of thermodynamics(!).

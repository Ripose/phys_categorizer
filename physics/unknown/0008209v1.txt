SUPERCONDUCTING ACCELERATOR CAVITIES *

Abstract

The  static  and  dynamic  structural  behavior  of
superconducting  cavities 
for  various  projects  was
determined by finite element structural analysis. The β =
0.61  cavity  shape  for  the  Neutron  Science  Project  was
studied in detail and found to meet all design requirements
if  fabricated  from  five  millimeter  thick  material  with  a
single annular stiffener. This 600 MHz cavity will have a
Lorentz  coefficient  of  –1.8  Hz/(Mv/meter)2  and  a  lowest
structural resonance of more than 100 Hz.

Cavities at β = 0.48, 0.61, and 0.77 were analyzed for a
Neutron Science Project concept which would incorporate
7-cell  cavities.  The  medium  and  high  beta  cavities  were
found  to  meet  all  criteria  but  it  was  not  possible  to
generate  a  β  =  0.48  cavity  with  a  Lorentz  coefficient  of
less than –3 Hz/(Mv/meter) 2.

 1  INTRODUCTION

There are quite a few accelerator projects underway for
which  elliptical  superconducting  cavities  are  planned.
This  paper  documents  structural  analysis  of  β  <  1
superconducting cavities for  the  Neutron  Science  Project
of JAERI [1] and includes consideration of Lorentz force
detuning,  cavity  fabrication,  vacuum  loading,  tuning
forces, and mechanical resonant frequencies.

 2 TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

While 

each 

specific 

accelerator  has 

technical
requirements with regard to the values of β, the number of
cells,  and  the  bore  sizes  of  the  cavities,  there  are  some
other physics and engineering considerations that must be
included  in  the  design  of  the  cavities.  Some  of  these
parameters, the peak electric and magnetic surface fields
along with the bore radius, affect the performance of the
cavities. Other parameters, such as the material thickness
and  the  wall  slope,  are  related  to  the  practical  matter  of
manufacture  of  the  cavities.  Lastly,  the  presence  or
absence of annular stiffeners has a significant effect upon
the  Lorentz  for  RF  detuning,  the  mechanical  resonant
frequencies,  and  the  tuning  forces.  A  detailed  discussion
of this is given in References 2 and 3.

The parameters are listed in Table 1. The value selected
for  Bpeak/Epeak  is  arguable  and  some  organisations  would
suggest  that  a  higher  value  would  be  more  suitable  if  it

resulted  in  a  lower  peak  electric  field.  Indeed,  all  of  the
values are to some extent arbitrary; they are certainly not
absolute.  However,  they  do  serve  as  guidelines  for
preliminary design of cavities.

 3  STATIC ANALYSIS OF CAVITIES
Three cavity mid-cell shapes were analysed: β = 0.48,
0.61, and 0.77. These were obtained from Reference 4 and
are shown on Figure 1. A β = 1 cross-section is shown for
reference.

Two-dimensional 

The  structural  analysis  was  carried  out  using
COSMOS/M[5]. 
axi-symmetric
elements  were  used  for  the  analysis  of  half-cells  to
determine  the  tuning  forces  plus  the  deflections,  stresses
and  frequency  shifts  under  vacuum  load  and  Lorentz
pressure. The frequency shifts were determined from the
output of SUPERFISH [6].

The  main  consideration  was  the  Lorentz  force  de-
tuning. The analyses were performed for various stiffener
ring radii. The results for the β = 0.61 cavity are shown on
Figure 2 for material thicknesses of 3, 4, and 5 mm. The
results  are  similar  for  the  other  two  cavities.  Without
annular stiffeners none of the cavity shapes will satisfy the
requirement  that  the  Lorentz  detuning  coefficient  of  the
cavity be less than –3 Hz/(Mv/meter)2. However, for the β
= 0.61 with the 4 mm thickness, the curve is quite flat so
the selection of the 7 inch stiffener radius is not rigid.

Some cases were run with two stiffener rings but these
resulted  in  unacceptably  high  tuning  forces.  Use  of  two
stiffener rings would also increase fabrication costs.

The results for the three cavities are listed on Table 2.
The β = 0.48 cavity does not meet the fabrication criteria
(Rmin > 2.0*t) and has a Lorentz coefficient that is greater
than  the  specified  value.  However,  with  the  lower-β
cavities operated at lower gradient (the requirement is that
Epeak  <  16.0  Mvolt/meter  [1])  this  may  be  acceptable.  At
this  peak  electric  field,  the  accelerating  field  is  only  3.7
Mvolt/meter and the Lorentz detuning is reduced to 1/8th
the value at Ea = 10 Mvolt/meter.

The deformation of the β = 0.48 cavity under Lorentz
pressure  resulting  from  an  accelerating  gradient  of  10
Mvolt/meter is shown on Figure 3. The Lorentz pressures
are  quite  low  with  the  maximum  being  0.48  #/in2.  The
axial deformations are similarly low; the maximum is 6.7
X 10-6 inch. This corresponds to a frequency shift of –330
Hz.

Three-dimensional finite element models were used  to
determine the gravity deformations of the complete 5-cell
and  7-cell  cavities.  These  analyses  were  run  using
COSMOS/M with three-node shell elements. The weights
and  mid-length  transverse  deflections  of  the  cavities  are
listed  on  Tables  3  and  4.  The  presence  of  the  stiffeners
produces a significant reduction of the deflection.

4  DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF CAVITIES
The three-dimensional finite element models described
in  the  previous  paragraph  were  used  to  determine  the
mechanical resonant  frequencies.  A  cross-section  of  a  5-
cell, un-stiffened β = 0.61 cavity is shown on Figure 5 and
the  results  for  5-cell  and  7-cell  cavities  are  listed  on
Tables 5 and 6 respectively. For these cases, the irises of
the  end-cells  were  held  rigidly  fixed  in  all  coordinates.
Use of other boundary conditions would have resulted in
lower frequencies.

as ideal  maximums.  As  in  the  case  of  a  similar  study  of
the  cavities  for  the  APT  linac  [8],  it  was  found  that  the
annular stiffeners would be required to meet the dynamic
requirements,  in  particular  when  the  effects  of  the  beam
tubes, etc. are included.

5  CONCLUSIONS

in  meeting 

 There  are  many  variables  to  consider  in  the  design  of
superconducting  cavities.  However, 
the
requirements  listed  in  Table  1,  the  options  diminish
rapidly. It is clear that for values of β < 0.5, the structural
design  of  these  cavities  is  a  challenge  at  600  MHz.
Minimization  of  the  Lorentz  force  detuning  will  likely
require  operation  of  β  <  0.5  cavities  at  Ea  <  10
Mvolt/meter. It is also clear that stiffeners will be required
to meet the mechanical resonant frequency requirement.

Past  experiments  [7]  have  shown  good  agreement  of
measured  mechanical  resonant  frequencies  with 
the
predicted values. It is important to note that the analyses
were  run  for  simple  cavities;  there  were  no  beam  tubes,
power couplers, HOM couplers, etc. included. In addition,
there  is  no  consideration  of  the  stiffness  of  the  cavity
support  structure.  Inclusion  of  any  or  all  of  these  items
will  reduce  the  mechanical  resonant  frequencies.  Thus,
the frequencies listed in Tables 5 and 6 must be regarded

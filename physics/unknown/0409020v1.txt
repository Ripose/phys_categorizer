Abstract: The article describes the CFD software tool FlowVision (OOO “Tesis”, Moscow). The 
model  equations  used  for  this  research  are  the  set  of  Reynolds  and  continuity  equations  and 
equations of the standard k – ε turbulence model. The aim of the paper was testing of FlowVision 
by comparing the computational results for a number of simple internal channel fluid flows with 
known  experimental  data.  The  test  cases  are  non-swirling  and  swirling  flows  in  pipes  and 
diffusers,  flows  in  stationary  and  rotating  bends.  Satisfactory  correspondence  of  results  was 
obtained both for flow patterns and respective quantitative values. 
Keywords:  internal  channel  flows,  swirling  flows,  rotating  bend,  k  –  ε  turbulence  model, 
FlowVision. 

1. Introduction 

 
Tendency  of  recent  years  is  appearance  and  wide  distribution  of  commercial  CFD 
software  tools  allowing  for  performing  of  numerical  computation  of  fluid  flows  of 
arbitrary complexity in the regions of arbitrary geometrical configuration. Dozens of such 
software  tools  are  listed  at  the  site  www.cfd-online.com  devoted  to  computational  fluid 
dynamics.  The  number  of  publications  in  the  leading  international  journals  on  fluid 
dynamics with results of successful application of commercial CFD tools for prediction 
of  local  and  integral  parameters  of  flows  in  hydraulic  machines  and  other  technical 
devices  steadily  grows  (Ruprecht,  2002).  Among  the  most  popular  CFD  packages  we 
should  mention,  in  particular,  CFX  (www.software.aeat.com/cfx),  STAR-CD  (www.cd-
adapco.com, 
Numeca 
(www.numeca.be).  Profound  documentation  is  supplied  with  these  and  other  CFD 
software  tools,  making  it  possible  for  a  qualified  enough  person  to  use  these  tools 
successfully for fluid flow computations, with no or minor technical assistance from the 
developers.  Of  course,  popularity  of  all  these  software  tools  is  also  advanced  by 
proceeding growth of computational power of personal computers.

FlowVision (Aksenov et al., 1993) is one of the first commercial multi-purpose CFD 
software  tools  developed  in  Russia.  This  tool  was  granted  for  test  application  to  the 
department  of  fluid  mechanics  of  Sumy  State  University.  In  this  paper,  we  present  the 
results of our testing, by comparing the computation results obtained with this tool with 
known experimental data for a number of simple fluid flows in channels. 

 

 
The 

2. Description of CFD software tool FlowVision 

software 

(Moscow, 
tool  FlowVision  developed  by  OOO 
www.tesis.com.ru,  www.flowvision.ru)  is  designed  for  numerical  simulation  of  fluid 
flows  and  since  the  year  2000  is  distributed  as  a  commercial  version.  The  results 
presented  in  the  article  are  obtained  using  the  release  issued  in  February  2003.  At  the 
latter  site,  the  full-functional  demo-version  of  FlowVision  is  freely  available  (the  sole 
restriction of the demo-version is that the number of nodes of the computational mesh can

not exceed 20 000). 

The software tool FlowVision does not have own preprocessor but supports import of 
geometry  from  a  number  of  modern  CAD  systems,  e.g.,  SolidWorks.  FlowVision  has 
convenient  interface  permitting  to  examine  the  imported  computational  domain,  specify 
boundary  conditions,  properties  of  the  medium,  computation  parameters  and  perform 
other necessary operations. 

The software tool FlowVision uses rectangular (Cartesian) computational mesh (Fig. 
1).  A  user  can  arbitrarily  thicken  this  mesh  where  necessary,  e.g.,  near  solid  walls. 
Besides, a number of criteria are provided for automatic thickening of the mesh, e.g., in 
zones of rapid changing of computed flow parameters. 
 

Figure 1. Window of the software tool FlowVision. In the window, for a certain problem,  
the geometrical model, post-processing layers and computational grid are shown. 

 
With  this  approach,  the  precision  of  numerical  solution  inevitably  degrades  due  to 
large divergence between grid lines and fluid flow lines. This deficiency is prevented by 
application  of  a  special  skewed  scheme  developed  by  authors  for  approximating  of 
higher-order derivatives (Aksenov et al., 1996). 

In  this  paper,  we  use  only  the  model  of  turbulent  flow  of  incompressible  fluid  that 
includes  time-dependent  Reynolds  equations  projected  to  each  of  three  Cartesian  axes, 
the  continuity  equation  and  the  equations  of  standard  k  –  ε  turbulence  model,  the  only 
turbulent model implemented in FlowVision nowadays. 

We should note, there are a number of other flow models implemented in FlowVision 
(model of laminar flow, compressible flow, flow with free surface, flow with combustion, 
etc.) that we don’t use in this paper. More detailed information concerning computation 
of  such  flows  is  presented  in  the  user  manual  and  tutorial  supplied  together  with 
FlowVision.

Discretization of the model flow equations is performed using control volume method. 
Algorithm  of  numerical  solution  of  equations  has  much  in  common  with  the  known 
scheme  SIMPLE  described  in  the  book  of  Patankar  (1980).  However,  some  numerical 
techniques  (special  skewed  scheme  for  approximating  of  derivatives,  algorithm  for 
removing of small cells) are used by the developers of FlowVision for the first time. 

Details of the  model  equations and numerical algorithm implemented in FlowVision 

are described in the papers of Aksenov et al. (1993, 1996). 

Solution  process  starts  from  a  certain  initial  approximation  imposed  as  source  data. 
Transient  solution  is  obtained  without  any  simplifications.  As  a  result  of  each  global 
iteration, after elapsing of corresponding time step, new values of velocities and pressure 
are obtained. Stationary solution, if exists, is reached after completion of a large enough 
number of iterations which correspond to large enough period of time. 

Convenient postprocessor interface permits to see at the screen both flow pattern and 
its integral parameters (e.g., loss factor between specified cross-sections). The results are 
updated after each global  iteration (as flow pattern changes with  elapsing of time). The 
possibility of saving the intermediate results as text files is available (which can be then 
processed, e.g., with Microsoft Excel), allowing for monitoring the convergence process, 
and obtaining the dependence of required parameters on time for transient flows. 

 

3. Results 

 
3.1. Flow at the initial section of a cylindrical pipe 
At  the  entrance  to  the  pipe  of  D0  in  diameter,  flow  velocity  is  constant  through  the 
cross-section. As the flow  develops under action of friction forces, velocity distribution 
approaches  the  logarithmic  law.  Experimental  data  are  taken  from  Barbin  et  al.  (1963), 
Reynolds  number  computed  by  inlet  diameter  was  388000.  Comparison  of  velocity 
distributions  is  performed  at  several  cross-sections  (Fig.  2).  For  this  simple  flow, 
computed  and  experimental  velocity  distributions  coincide  well  at  intermediate  cross-
sections, and at the last cross-section the results somewhat diverge. Maximum velocity at 
the channel axis, according to experiment, was u / U0 = 1.22, according to computation – 
1.195.  More  exact  results  for  this  flow  were  obtained  using  much  simpler  algorithm 
(Kochevsky, 2001) that took into account axial symmetry and parabolic character of flow. 
In order to check grid independence of solution, the computations were performed for 
several  grids  of  different  thickness.  Taking  into  account  good  coincidence  of  results 
obtained with grids 10 x 10 x 37 and 14 x 14 x 49 (Fig. 2), further thickening of grid for 
this problem seems to be not necessary. Time for flow computation with the grid 14 x 14 
x 49 using PC with processor Pentium III 500 and 64 MB RAM was about half an hour 
per 50 global iterations. 

As an indicator of convergence process, maximum velocity at the last cross-section is 
convenient  to  use.  Figure  3  presents  variation  of  this  velocity  with  number  of  global 
iterations.  As  it  is  seen,  after  25  iterations  variations  of  this  velocity  don’t  exceed  1%. 
According to recommendations of the user guide, time step corresponding to one global 
iteration for this and subsequent problems was chosen to be approximately equal to one 
tenth of time required for a fluid particle to pass through the domain, from the inlet to the 
outlet. 

Loss factor along the length from the medium till the end of the pipe, computed with 
FlowVision,  was  0.292,  and  according  to  the  formula  of  Filonenko  –  Altshul  (Idelchik, 
1975,  Eq.  (2.5))  for  developed  flow  in  a  hydraulically  smooth  pipe  it  should  equal  to 
0.238.  The  correspondence  of  results  is  acceptable,  taking  into  account  that  in  our  case 
the flow is not yet developed, and restructuring of flow implies additional losses.

3.2. Flow in diffusers of large internal angles 
An  important  advantage  of  the  software  tool  FlowVision  is  possibility  to  compute 
successfully  flows  with  symmetrical  computational  domain  and  symmetrical  boundary 
conditions, where the flow is not symmetrical and, moreover, transient. 

So,  in  a  conical  diffuser  with  large  internal  angle  the  flow  separates  and  attaches  to 
part  of  the  wall  in  random  way.  The  position  of  separation  zone  varies  randomly  along 
circumference  of  diffuser  (Idelchik,  1975).  This  known  physical  phenomenon  is 
reproduced by computation (Fig. 4). Figure 5 presents corresponding loss factors obtained 
by computation in FlowVision and taken using interpolation from that reference book.

Note  that  for  this  flow  the  solution  process  does  not  converge  to  the  stationary 
solution, and the computed loss factors presented at Fig. 5 are approximate time-averaged 
values. Considering that loss factor in a diffuser can substantially depend on a number of 
factors  that  are  difficult  to  take  into  account,  the  correspondence  of  results  can  be 
regarded as satisfactory. 

3.3. Solid body swirled flow in a conical diffuser 
Such  swirl  can  be  obtained  if  the  flow  enters  the  diffuser  passing  through  a  section 
filled with straws or honeycomb, and this section rotates relative to the diffuser axis using 
an external drive. For performing the comparison, experimental results of Clausen et al. 
(1993)  are  taken.  Area  ratio  of  the  diffuser  (ratio  of  areas  of  outlet  and  inlet  cross-
sections) was 2.84, internal angle – 20°, Reynolds number computed by inlet diameter – 
212000. As the source data, distributions of axial and circumferential velocity at the inlet 
cross-section are specified. 

Here,  the  following  physical  effect  occurs:  as  swirl  weakens  downstream  (due  to 
expansion of flow and action of friction forces), the flow is pressed to the periphery. In 
the  experiment,  the  swirl  was  so  strong  that  axial  velocity  at  the  diffuser  axis  dropped 
almost till zero (when the inlet swirl is still stronger, reverse flow along the diffuser axis 
is observed). It makes impossible to use parabolic method of computation, like that in the 
paper of Kochevsky (2001).

a) Axial velocity 

 
Figure  6  presents  distributions  of  axial  and  circumferential  velocity  at  the  inlet  and 
outlet  cross-sections  of  the  diffuser.  The  correspondence  of  results  computed  in 
FlowVision with experimental results is good for this flow. Similar flow was investigated 
in Armfield et al. (1990) with the same turbulence model, where obtained correspondence 
of computed and experimental results was as good as here. 
3.4. Free vortex swirled flow in a conical diffuser 
Such  swirl  is  added  to  flow,  for  example,  when  flow  passes  between  guide  vanes. 
Near channel axis, the circumferential velocity decreases linearly till zero. For performing 
the  comparison,  experimental  results  of  Senoo  et  al.  (1978)  are  taken.  Area  ratio  of  the 
diffuser  was  4.0,  internal  angle  –  12°,  Reynolds  number  computed  by  inlet  diameter  – 
about 200000. 

In this experiment, the swirl intensity also was so large that the axial velocity almost 
reached  zero  at  the  diffuser  axis.  Figure  7  presents  distributions  of  axial  and 
circumferential  velocity  at  the  inlet  and  outlet  cross-sections.  Again,  quite  good 
correspondence of computed and experimental results is observed.

3.5. Flow in a bend of square section with 180-degree flow turn 
For comparison, experimental results of Chang et al. (1983) are used. The considered 
channel is presented at Fig. 8. The flow is symmetrical relative to medium plane of the 
channel,  thus,  in  order  to  spare  computational  resources,  only  half  of  the  channel  was 
used  as  the  computational  domain.  Reynolds  number  computed  by  hydraulic  diameter 
was 58000. 

Figure 8. Geometrical configuration of the channel 

 

 
A physical effect peculiar  to this flow is the twin vortex occurring as the flow turns 
(Fig.  9).  Fluid  moves  to  the  external  radius  of  bend  along  the  symmetry  plane  of  the 
channel  and  returns  back  along  the  side  walls.  Figure  10  presents  distributions  of  axial 
velocity at several intermediate cross-sections of bend (H – side of a cross-section of the 
channel).  The  distributions  are  taken  at  the  plane  equidistant  from  the  symmetry  plane 
and lower wall of the channel.

As  one  can  see,  the  computed  and  experimental  results  look  similar,  however, 
significant quantitative divergence is observed. Both height of peaks near channel walls 
and position and depth of pit at the middle obtained by computation don’t coincide with 
those observed experimentally. 

This flow was investigated numerically also in the paper of Choi et al. (1989) using a 
similar  computational  algorithm  but  more  complex  turbulence  models.  The  conclusion 
was  made  that  for  this  flow,  the  standard  k  –  ε  turbulence  model  gives  somewhat 
inaccurate solution, more precise results were obtained, in particular, using the Reynolds 
algebraic  stress  model.  Another  reason  for  difference  of  results  at  Fig.  10  is  seemingly 
application  of  Cartesian  computational  grid  that  degrades  precision  of  discretization  of 
derivatives. 

3.6. Flow in a rotating channel 
For  comparison,  experimental  results  of  Moore  (1973)  are  used.  Geometrical 
configuration of the channel is presented at Fig. 11. As one can see, it resembles in many 
aspects  the  geometrical  configuration  of  a  blade-to-blade  channel  of  a  radial-flow 
impeller  with  radial  blades.  The  channel  rotates  around  the  axis  of  inlet  cylindrical 
section. The flow enters the channel along its rotation axis, then turns in radial direction 
and expands. Outlet section of the channel is open to atmosphere.

The  flow  enters  the  channel  through  a  stabilizing  device  ensuring  the  through-flow 
velocity is constant through the inlet cross-section. Then channel walls gradually involve 
the  flow  in  rotation.  Rotational  speed  of  the  channel  was  206  rpm.  Upstream  of 
stabilizing device, a blower was provided, allowing for supply of air to the channel with 
different flow rate. 

This flow is featured with the following physical effects. 
-  As distance from the rotation axis increases, static pressure grows rapidly due to 
action of centrifugal force. Additionally, it grows due to expansion of the channel. 
-  The pressure p is larger at the pressure side than at the suction side. As it follows 
from  the  analysis  of  potential  flow  (not  regarding  viscous  effects),  the  pressure 
decreases  from  the  pressure  side  to  the  suction  side,  according  to  the  linear  law  
∂p / ρ ∂y = – 2 ω u, where ω is angular rotational speed of the channel. 

-  As it follows from the analysis of potential flow, through-flow velocity u increases 
in every cross-section from the pressure side to the suction side, according to the 
law ∂u / ∂y = 2 ω (Fig. 12). 

-  At low flow rate, the flow in the channel is pressed to the suction side along the 
whole  length  of  the  channel.  Thus,  at  the  pressure  side,  the  reverse  flow  is 
observed when the distance from the rotation axis is large enough (Fig. 12). 

All these effects are well reproduced by computation. 
-  According to the experiment, when the flow rate is large enough, the flow at some 
distance from the rotation axis separates from the suction side and is pressed to the 
pressure side. The reason for this is seemingly in rapid growth of pressure along 
the  suction  side  as  the  channel  expands  (Fig.  13).  Just  near  this  wall  the  flow  is 
inclined  to  separation.  At  low  flow  rate  this  separation  does  not  occur,  because 
earlier the flow separates from the pressure side. 

This separation occurs also in computation (Fig. 14), though the computation predicts 

separation also from the pressure side that was not observed experimentally.

At the middle part of the channel, isolines restrict zones of reverse flow near pressure side and suction side 

 
This  rather  simple  experiment  is  a  good  illustration  explaining  why  location  of 
impeller  depends 

in  blade-to-blade  channels  of  a  radial-flow 

separation  zones 
significantly on the flow rate. 

For  performing  computation  in  FlowVision,  we  have  used  the  computational  grid 
containing  46  x  12  x  15  nodes,  with  one  additional  level  of  splitting  for  cells  crossing 
solid  surfaces.  The  computation  was  performed  in  relative  motion.  Here,  as  the  inlet 
boundary condition, in addition to through-flow velocity, solid body swirl was imposed. 
The  rotational  speed  of  the  swirl  was  –  206  rpm  (opposite  to  the  direction  of  channel 
rotation).  In  order  to  simulate  properly  the  flow  at  the  outlet  region,  the  computational 
domain included also the space downstream of the channel, where the flow went to the 
atmosphere (Fig. 13 – 15). Figure 15 shows vectors of flow velocity: at the inlet region – 
in relative motion, at the outlet region – in absolute motion.

and in absolute motion (inside the channel and at the channel outlet) at medium flow rate 

 
Note  that  in  the  paper  of  Majumdar  et  al.  (1977)  this  flow  was  computed  using  a 
sweep  scheme,  with  the  same  k  –  ε  turbulence  model.  The  separation  of  flow  from  the 
suction side was not observed in that paper, thus demonstrating that Reynolds equations 
should not be simplified by order-of-magnitude analysis for simulation of this flow. 

Figure 16 presents computed in FlowVision and experimental velocity distributions at 
the cross-section before channel outlet, at different flow rates. As can be seen, the listed 
experimental  physical  effects  are  reflected  by  computation,  however,  significant 
discrepancy of computational and experimental results is available. The reasons for this 
discrepancy are seemingly the same as for the previous flow.

4. Conclusion 

 
For  the  flows  presented  here,  we  have  obtained  good  qualitative  and  at  least 
satisfactory quantitative correspondence of results obtained using the CFD software tool 
FlowVision  with  experimental  results.  For  types  of  flows  presented  here,  we  should 
recognize  the  approach  implemented  in  FlowVision  to  be  rather  good  for  numerical 
simulations.

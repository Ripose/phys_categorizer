Abstract-- Light-ion microbeams provide a unique opportunity 
to  irradiate  biological  samples  at  the  cellular  level  and  to 
investigate  radiobiological  effects  at  low  doses  of  high  LET 
ionising radiation. Since 1998 a single-ion irradiation facility has 
been  developed  on  the  focused  horizontal  microbeam  line  of  the 
CENBG 3.5 MV Van de Graaff accelerator. This setup delivers in 
air single protons and alpha particles of a few MeV onto cultured 
cells,  with  a  spatial  resolution  of  a  few  microns,  allowing 
subcellular  targeting.  In  this  paper,  we  present  results  from  the 
use  of  the  GEANT4  toolkit  to  simulate  cellular  irradiation  with 
the CENBG microbeam line, from the entrance to the microprobe 
up to the cellular medium.

microbeam line elements (beam pipe residual gas, collimators,

increase  the  spatial  and  energy  dispersions  of  the  beam  and 
degrade  the  targeting  resolution  [1]-[3].  First  estimations  of 
GEANT4  simulation  capabilities  at  the  micrometer  scale 
appear promising, encouraging us to study for the first time the 
entire  experimental  setup,  paying  particular  attention  to  the 
modelling of the magnetic lenses [4].

II.  THE MICROBEAM LINE SETUP 

The microbeam line of CENBG allows single ion irradiation of 
individual  cells  with  proton  or  alpha  particles  [2],  [3].  The 
incident  beam  is  strongly  collimated  using  a  5  µm  circular 
object  collimator  and  a  10  µm  circular  diaphragm,  6  m  away 
from  the  collimator,  allowing  to  reach  a  low  flux  mode 
required  for  single  ion  irradiation  (typically  a  few  hundred 
particles on target per second). The residual air pressure of the 
whole  beam  line  is  kept  under  5.10-6  mbar. The  beam  is  then 
focused  using  four  magnetic  quadrupoles  in  the  so  called 
Dymnikov  magnetic  configuration,  leading  to  symmetrical 
transverse  demagnification  factors 
  on 
2G  have been adjusted to focus 
the  beam  on  the  cellular  target  location,  235  mm  away  from 
the physical exit of the last quadrupole. Single ions are counted

using a 3.5 mm long isobutane proportional counter running at 
a gas pressure of 10 mbar ; a 10 µm circular collimator ensures 
the pressure transition between the beam pipe and the counter. 
The  beam  is  extracted  back  into  the  air  through  a  150  nm 
square  Si3N4  window  (1  mm2)  and  is  sent  through  a  100  µm 
ambient air gap to a 4 µm polypropylen foil, where the HaCat 
cells  have  attached  and  grown.  The  cells  are  kept  alive  in  a 
dedicated  well  containing  Keratinocyte  Growing  Medium, 
sealed  by  a  microscope  glass  slide.  The  whole  line  geometry 
and list of materials have been computed in GEANT4 version 
5.2  and  are  shown  on  Fig.  1.  We  have  used  the  low  energy 
electromagnetic  package  G4LOWEM2.2  and  the  electronic 
stopping  power 
table  ICRU_R49He.  To  ensure  reliable 
multiple  scattering  modelling  and  to  reproduce  experimental 
beam  straggling  measurements  performed  on  the  microbeam 
line, we have forced an elementary step in each volume equal 
to one tenth of the corresponding volume size along the beam 
propagation axis  z  and the value of the secondary particle cut 
has been uniquely set to 100 µm [4].

IV.  THE FOCUSING QUADRUPLET 

A.  Fringing field description 

GEANT4 can track a charged particle in any type of magnetic 
field, as long as the field can be described analytically. It takes 
approximately 3 s on a Intel Xeon 2.7 GHz PC to track a single 
ray  with  a  maximum  step  length  of  100  µm  in  the  magnetic 
field  region.  In  order  to  calculate  the  particle  trajectories 
through the quadruplet system, we have chosen to describe the 
magnetic field profile using the Enge model [5], including the 
modelling  of  fringing  fields.  In  the  case  of  a  perfect 
quadrupole,  without  fringing  field,  the  magnetic  field  inside 
the  quadrupole  is  simply  given  by 
.

For  the  chosen  gradient  configuration,  GEANT4  allows  the

from the dependence of the beam transverse position on target 
as a function of : 
-  the  initial  angles  θ   and  φ ,  for  the  spherical  aberrations

From  these  coefficients,  it  is  possible  to  illustrate  the 
contribution  of  the  high  order  aberrations  to  the  beam  spot 
shape  on  target,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5,  allowing  the  design  of 
specific collimator geometries to remove the image distortions. 
A precise determination of these coefficients could also help in 
the iterative optimization of the quadruplet field gradients.  
 

C.  Tracking precision 

The study of the transverse displacement in the image plane as 
a function of shooting angles over a wide range of angles (10-1 
mrad  down  to  10-10  mrad)  shows  a  smooth  polynomial 
variation  in  both  planes  (refer  to  Fig.  6)  and  gives  us 
confidence in the GEANT4 tracking capabilities at this scale. 

V.  CELLULAR IRRADIATION 

A.  Beam energy and spatial distributions on target 

The beam energy and spatial distributions obtained with 20000 
incident  alphas  are  shown  in  Fig.  7  for  a  pipe  residual  air 
pressure  of  5.10-6  mbar.  A  Gaussian  fit  to  the  energy

From  these  distributions,  we  can  estimate  the  probability  of

C.  Dose calculation 

We have estimated the dose deposited by the alpha beam in a 
typical  HaCat  cell,  whose  cytoplasm  and  nucleus  have  been 
modelled  from  confocal  microscopy  images  as  tubes  of 
elliptical  cross  section  fixed  on  the  polypropylen  foil  along 
their revolution axis. For the cytoplasm,  the half axes are 4.35 
µm  and  7.3  µm  long  and  the  tube  length  is  15  µm.  For  the 

nucleus,  the  half  axes  are  3.5  µm  and  6.25  µm  long  and  the 
tube  length  is  9.5  µm.  Both  are  made  of  water.  The 
corresponding dose distributions are shown in Fig. 8. The dose 
distribution in the cytoplasm shows two populations : the low 
dose  part  corresponding  to  alpha  particles  that  have  crossed 
both the cytoplasm and the  nucleus, and the  higher dose part, 
corresponding  to  alphas  that  have  hit  the  cytoplasm  near  the 
edge,  without  reaching  the  nucleus.  The  most  probable  dose 
deposit in the nucleus reaches : 

nD ≈

0.33 Gy

 

From this estimation, it appears that a 3 MeV alpha beam may 
deliver doses to cellular nuclei up to a few tenths of a Gray.  

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 

This study shows GEANT4’s capabilities and flexibility in the 
simulation  of  cellular  irradiation  experimental  setups  at  the 
micrometer scale. The CENBG irradiation microbeam line will 
soon provide experimental data at this scale that will contribute 
to validate our simulations, especially in the framework of the 
new  GEANT  DNA  project.  In  the  near  future  (2005),  a  new 
generation  Singletron  accelerator  will  be  installed  at  CENBG 
and a nanobeam line will be developed for cellular irradiation 
at 
its 
the  nanometer  scale.  We  believe  GEANT4  and 
extensions will become the state of the art in the high precision 
simulation of light ion irradiation setups at the micrometer and 
nanometer scales.

Fig. 1.  Details of the microbeam line geometry and materials along the  z  propagation axis, as they are defined in GEANT4. The cultured cells are located 235 

mm away from the physical exit of the last quadrupole. Note the modelling of the collimators’ geometry ; they are defined as an assembly of two joined conical 
sections to reproduce the shape observed by the mean of an electronic microscope [4].  

Fig. 2.  The top plots show the evolution of the space phase of the beam external envelope - ( , )

y φ in blue - from the collimator object (left), inside 
the quadruplet (middle) and before the target (right), along the beam propagation axis. The left and middle bottom plots show the beam profiles in the transverse X 
(red) and Y (blue) planes along the propagation axis. The right hand side plot shows the beam spot shape around the target position (235 mm). Note the typical 
distortions caused by the spherical aberrations of the quadruplet. Please see the electronic version for the figures in colour [8].

Fig. 3.  Magnetic field components inside the quadruplet along the propagation axis (

xB in red dash, 

yB in blue dot-dot, 

zB in black dash-dot). The solid line 

shows the field total magnitude. The field has been calculated at the distance 

r =

3 2  mm

 from the propagation axis.

 
Fig. 4.  Evolution of the X transverse position of the beam on target as a function of the incident angles 

,θ φ . A third order polynomial fit to this 2D curve 

allows the estimation of the system intrinsic spherical aberration coefficients  x θ ,

Fig. 5.  Beam spot shape on target obtained assuming a uniform elliptical space phase distribution in both transverse planes. The central red spot shows the first 
order beam spot, with a diameter of 0.5 micrometer ; for comparison, the outer circle represents the 5 micrometer diameter object collimator. The grey area shows 
the second order chromatic aberrations contribution and the blue area (aisles) shows the third order spherical aberrations. Note the asymmetrical shape of the 
chromatic and spherical components, which does not appear on the first order collimator image.

Fig. 7. The left plot shows in blue the alpha beam kinetic energy distribution on target, adjusted to a Gaussian distribution (

T =

2.37

±

0.01 MeV

) and the 

red background shows alphas that have been scattered by the diaphragm edges before reaching the target. The middle plot shows the corresponding spatial 
distributions on target. The beam is spread inside a square of side slightly over 1 mm, corresponding to the surface of the Si3N4 window. Finally, the right plot 
shows the beam spatial distribution when the residual low pressure air inside the beam pipe has been replaced by vacuum. No diaphragm scattering has been 
observed in this case.
 
 

 

Fig. 8. Dose distributions in the HaCat cell geometrical model. The shaded distribution shows the dose distribution in the cytoplasm. The low dose part 

corresponds to particles crossing both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The higher dose part is deposited by alpha particles that hit the cytoplasm only, without 
reaching the nucleus. The purple distribution shows the dose distribution in the nucleus.

We put forward properties of solitons supported by optical lattices featuring topological 

dislocations, and show that solitons experience attractive and repulsive forces around the 

dislocations. Suitable arrangements of dislocations are even found to form soliton traps, 

and the properties of such solitons are shown to crucially depend on the trap topology. 

The uncovered phenomenon opens a new concept for soliton control and manipulation, 

e.g., in disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates.

Optical lattices are unique objects that have found various applications in many 

branches of the fundamental science. Among the most representative examples are Bose-

Einstein condensates trapped in standing light waves [1], the possibility of arrangement, 

guidance or deflection of microscopic particles with reconfigurable lattices [2], fabrication 

of  photonic  crystals  by  holographic  lithography  [3],  etc.  In  optics  such  lattices  can  be 

used  to  create  refractive  index  modulations  that  substantially  affect  properties  of  the 

light beams propagating in nonlinear media [4], opening broad prospects for creation of 

guiding structures whose properties can be fine-tuned by the lattice-inducing waves. The 

periodic  optical  lattices  formed  with  standing  or  several  interfering  plane  waves  can 

support  diverse  types  of  the  matter  wave  and  optical  solitons,  including  one-  and  two-

dimensional,  multi-humped,  and  vortex  solitons  [1,4,5].  Such  lattices,  in  addition,  offer 

the  possibility  to  manage  diffraction  broadening  of  beams  and  an  enriched  set  of 

phenomena  [6],  previously  encountered  only  in  technologically  fabricated  waveguide 

arrays (for a recent review see Ref. [7]). 

The properties of solitons supported by the lattice are dictated to a large extent 

by the shape of the lattice-creating wave. Besides sets of plane waves that are capable to

produce periodic lattices, one can form lattices with nondiffracting beams, such as Bessel 

beams. Bessel lattices exhibit  radial  symmetry  that  offers  new  opportunities  for  soliton 

existence  and  control  in  comparison  with  periodic  ones  [8].  Yet,  all  optical  lattices 

investigated  so  far  feature  a  topologically  regular  structure.  However,  there  exists  a 

whole  completely  distinct  class  of  lattices  possessing  higher  topological  complexity,  e.g., 

lattices containing dislocations. In contrast to regular lattices, the guiding properties of 

such  lattices  can  change  dramatically  in  the  vicinity  of  dislocations,  a  possibility  that 

leads  to  important  new  physical  phenomena.  In  this  respect,  notice  the  recently 

demonstrated creation of a wide variety of optical potentials for atom manipulation with 

spatial  light  modulators  [9-11].  Soliton  propagation  in  topologically  nontrivial  networks 

of  evanescently  coupled  waveguides  and  star-shaped  optical  networks  created  in  Bose-

Einstein condensates have been also analyzed very recently [12]. 

In  this  Letter  we  put  forward  the  concept  that  solitons  can  experience  dragging 

forces  when  released  into  lattices  containing  topological  dislocations.  Such  phenomenon 

induces a soliton dragging along predetermined paths that are defined by the type of the 

dislocation. We reveal that several dislocations form soliton traps supporting stationary 

solitons whose properties and stability depend crucially on trap topology. To be specific, 

we consider lattices produced by the interference between plane waves and waves with 

nested vortices that can be imprinted in disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates, but the 

idea  can  be  extended  to  other  topological  landscapes  and  physical  settings  wherever 

stable lattices with topological dislocations can be formed. 

The generic equation describing the evolution of matter (optical) wave packets in 

the presence of the mean field (Kerr-type) cubic nonlinearity and weak optical potential 

(transverse refractive index modulation) is the nonlinear Schrödinger equation:

and orientations  φ . Such optical lattices may be produced with spatial light modulators 

k

[9,10]  that  were  successfully  used  for  optical  confinement  of  Bose-Einstein  condensates 

[11]. Notice, that the lattice produced by the interference of plane wave and wave with 

several nested vortices is not stationary and distorts upon propagation. However, it may 

be implemented in two-dimensional, or disk-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates, which are 

elongated  in  transverse  ( ,

  plane  and  strongly  confined  in  the  direction  of  light 

propagation  ( ρ   axis),  so  that  the  lattice-creating  waves  does  not  vary  inside  the 

condensate  thickness.  Such  strong  confinement  in  Bose-Einstein  condensates  can  be 

achieved in asymmetric magnetic harmonic traps with the ratio of oscillation frequencies

  (see  Refs.  [13]  for  the  details  of  the  experimental

the  impact  of  harmonic  trapping  potential  in  Eq.  (1)  because  of  the  considerable 

difference  in  the  characteristic  transverse  scales  of  this  potential  and  lattice  R

( ,η ζ

)

. 

Indeed, the parameters of the lattice produced with spatial light modulator can be made 

close  to  that  for  harmonic  lattices  imprinted  with  standing  light  waves  [1,9-11].  Thus, 

typical  transverse  scale  of  lattice  R

  in  Eq.  (1)  may  range  from  1  to  10

In the optical context  q  is the dimensionless field amplitude; the longitudinal  ξ

width,  respectively;  parameter

  is  proportional  to  refractive  index  modulation  depth. 

Complex refractive index landscapes can be induced in suitable optical crystals, e.g. by 

femtosecond  laser  pulses  [15],  a possibility  that  might  allow  exploration  of  our  concept  

in such setting too. Optically-induced lattices might be another possibility, provided that

dynamical  instabilities  of  the  lattice  can  be  overcome  (e.g.,  by  introducing  additional 

periodicities,  as  in  [16],  or  stabilizing  nonlinear  effects).  Equation  (1)  admits  some

Some representative examples of lattices produced by interference of plane wave 

and wave with nested unit-charge vortex are shown in Fig. 1. We set  α

4=

 and vary 

p

  and 

.  Such  lattices  feature  clearly  pronounced  transverse  channels  where  solitons 

0φ
can travel. The screw phase dislocation results in appearance of topological defects in the 

form of the characteristic fork, so that some lattice channels can fuse or disappear in the 

dislocation. Notice, that lattice periodicity is broken only locally, in a close proximity of 

dislocation, while far from the dislocation lattice profile resembles that of the quasi-one-

dimensional lattice with modulation along  η  axis that could be produced by interference 

of two plane waves  exp(

iαη±

)

. Far from the dislocation the period of the lattices shown 

in  Fig.  1  along 

η

  axis  is  given  by  T

=

2

/π

α

.  The  lattice  structure  in  the  dislocation 

depends on the orientation of vortex origin 

 and vortex charge. The higher the charge 

φ
0

the stronger the lattice topological complexity and more channels can fuse or disappear 

in the dislocation. 

The  central  result  of  this  Letter  is  that  lattice  topological  features  produced  by 

screw phase dislocations profoundly affect behavior of solitons launched into the lattice, 

so that lattice intensity gradient in the vicinity of the dislocation results in appearance 

of forces acting on the soliton. The sign and modulus of these forces are dictated by the 

type of dislocation and, in particular, by the charge of screw phase dislocation in lattice-

creating wave. The interaction strength decreases with increase of the distance between 

soliton center and dislocation. Close to the dislocation forces acting on soliton results in 

its fast transverse displacement when it is initially launched parallel to 

ξ

 axis. Figure 1 

shows  directions  of  displacement  for  different  initial  soliton  positions.  We  used  as  an 

input solitons with U

4.5=

 supported by undistorted quasi-one-dimensional lattice with 

period T

=

2 /π α

 and placed them into channels of distorted lattice close to dislocation. 

In  this  case  soliton  profile  remains  almost  unchanged  during  evolution  while  its  center 

experiences progressive shift in the transverse plane. For both vortex orientations shown 

in Fig. 1 solitons start to move initially in negative direction of  ζ -axis. Solitons that are 

launched at  ζ

0>

 can be bounced back at bends of lattice channels when they approach 

dislocation (this is indicated by double arrows). Notice, that direction of forces acting on 

 

4

solitons  can  be  reversed  by  the  inversion  of  vortex  charge  (this  is  accompanied  by  the 

corresponding  lattice  modification).  Since  far  from  the  dislocation  solitons  move  freely 

along  undistorted  channels  of  the  lattice,  it  is  possible  to  introduce  asymptotic  escape 

velocity 

escα

 for solitons released at position (

0,

)δζ−

. The escape velocity 

escα

 decreases 

with increase of initial separation between soliton and dislocation (Fig. 1). 

The dependence of sign and magnitude of forces acting on solitons on the lattice 

topology comprises the possibility to use combinations of several dislocations (produced 

by spatially separated oppositely charged vortices) for creation of double lattice defects, 

or soliton traps, which feature equilibrium regions that are capable to support stationary 

solitons. Several examples of such traps are shown in Fig. 2. Positive traps are formed 

when origins of oppositely charged vortices are oriented in opposite directions (positive 

and  negative  directions  of 

ζ

  axis)  and  several  lattice  rows  fuse  to  form  region  where 

R η ζ
( , )

 is locally increased. The negative traps are produced when the vortex origins are 

oriented  in  the  same  direction  and  feature  the  break-up  of  several  lattice  channels,  i.e. 

regions where  R

( , )η ζ

 is locally decreased. A qualitative map of forces acting on solitons 

in the vicinity of the traps can be obtained with the aid of effective particle approach [6] 

that yields the equations

traps are shown in Fig. 4. Depending on the trap length and type (positive or negative) 

the profile of soliton can be elongated or compressed along the  ζ  axis. For small length 

of the positive trap the energy of the corresponding solitons is a monotonically growing 

function of propagation constant (Fig. 5(a)) and vanishes at the cutoff b . Close to the 

co

cutoff the soliton expands over several lattice channels. At b

 the transverse extent 

of soliton decreases and its energy approaches the critical value U

for unstable solitons in the absence of the lattice. With increase of the trap length above 

a certain value, the U b  dependence changes qualitatively (see Fig. 5(b)) and gradually

approaches dependence U

dimensional lattice. Figure 5(c) shows U b  diagram for solitons supported by negative

lattice  trap.  In  this  case  soliton  ceases  to  exist  in  the  cutoff  without  any  topological 

shape  transformation,  while  its  energy  decreases  monotonically  with  b .  Following  the 

Vakhitov-Kolokolov stability criterion one may expect that positive lattice traps are able 

to support stable solitons with dU

traps are unstable since  dU

. Validity of such criterion was fully confirmed by

perturbations  to  ideal  soliton  shapes.  This  result  confirms  the  possibility  to  generate 

desired soliton trapping potentials by using the adequate topological landscapes. It also 

confirms the crucial importance of trap topology and its transverse extent for properties 

and  stability  of  solitons  that  it  supports,  as  well  as  for  magnitude  and  sing  of  forces 

experienced by outermost solitons. 

In conclusion, we put forward the new concept of dragging of solitons by optical 

lattice  featuring  topological  dislocations.  We  revealed  that  lattice  gradients  induced  by 

dislocations produce attractive and repulsive forces on solitons released into the lattices. 

As a consequence, we uncovered that several dislocations can even form traps supporting 

localized solitons. Complex light field distributions required for creation of lattices with 

dislocations  in  disk-shaped  Bose-Einstein  condensates  can  be  generated  with  suitable 

spatial light modulators.

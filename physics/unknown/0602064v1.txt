In  the  statistical  analysis  of  objects,  samples  and  populations  with  quantitative 

variables, in many occasions we are interested in knowing the proportions that exist between 

the  different  variables  from  a  same  object;  if  these  proportions  have  relations  of  normality 

among  them,  that  is  to  say,  if  in  the  sample  are  these  same  proportions,  and  finally  if  the 

deviations of concrete physical or statistical normality have meaning.  

The present study suggests the strategy of to use reference models for the analysis of 

the proportionality, using like example the studies of human proportionality from the method 

Phantom of Ross and Wilson and its extension towards scalable models. 

Introduction. 

Let  us  suppose  that  we  have  a  population  formed  by  defined  objects  by  means  of 

quantitative variables. In order to make a study of such variables and their interrelations we 

must act of the following form: 

1.  To determine a representative sample of the population. 

2.  To make the measures and register the variables for each object of the sample. 

3.  To carry out the statistical tests and contrasts applicable to the values obtained during 

the measures of the sample objects.

One  of  the  first  questions  that  arise  in  any  statistical  study  of  populations  is:  What 

relation  exists  between  the  different  variables  measured  for  a  same  object?.  That  is  to  say, 

How the intra-individual proportions are related to the proportions of the variable samples?. 

In order to respond to these questions in the present study we raised the strategy to use 

reference  models  for  the  analysis  of  the  proportionality.  That  is  to  say,  ideal  models  of 

objects  that  are  used  like  standard  of  measurement  in  proportionality.  Some  times,  will  be 

models  formed  by  means  of  statistical  averages,  other  times  convenient  or  useful 

mathematical models to even facilitate the calculations and in some cases, the models will be 

established like canons of some specific quality. 

The  methods  of  analyses  used  in  our  study  will  be  applied  to  the  studies  of  human 

proportionality  through  the  Phantom  method  of  Ross  and  Wilson,  extending  their  initial 

utility  like  method  to  quantify  the  proportions,  towards  a  more  complete  statistical 

interpretation and an extension towards scalable strategies of the Phantom model. 

The proportionality concept. 

The  proportionality  is  the  mathematical  property  according  to  which  two  objects  A 

and  B,  each  one  with  two  quantitative  variables:  variable1  y  variable2  (with  equal 

dimensions); they fulfill the following property:

If the equation (1) is fulfilled it says that the variables:variable1  y variable2 , in the 

objects A and B, are in proportion. 

Nevertheless, the expression (1) is only valid when the dimensions of variable1  and 

variable2  are  the  same  ones.  When  the  dimensions  of  these  two  properties  are  n1  and  n2 

respectively, the equation (1) becomes general of the form:

Let us suppose that the relation (2) was not fulfilled because the objects A and B were 

not in proportion, but we were interested in calculating what ∆x value would be necessary to 

add to variable1(A) in order to fulfill the relation (2). Let us call n to the ratio between two 

dimensions

The value of ∆x can be interpreted like the difference or existing proportional distance 

between  the  objects  A  and  B  respect  to  the  variables  variable1  and  variable2.  To  variable 

variable2 is called proportionality base.  

Usually,  in  the  proportionality  studies,  the  comparison  is  not  made  between  two 

objects  nobodies,  but  between  an  object  B  and  another  P  that  we  used  like  reference  or 

 

standard. 

Let us suppose, as it is used normally, that the P standard to that we will call reference 

model,  is  not  a  real  object,  but  the  result  of  the  statistical  distribution  of  a  representative 

sample  of  a  population  in  which  it  is  including  object  B.  In  these  conditions,  if  the 

distribution of the variables of the sample is a normal distribution, the reference one will be 

defined using a table that contains the values of the averages and standard deviations of the 

different variables from the sample. That is to say, the reference model P will be defined in 

the form of table 1

For  example:    In  the  studies  of  human  proportionality,  Ross  and  Wilson  in  1974 

defined  a  proportionality  standard  to  which  they  called  “Phantom”  model  so  that  it  served 

like reference. The calculation of the values corresponding to the kinanthropometric variables 

of  the  Phantom  model  was  based  on  extensive  data  bases  of  general  population.  The 

perimeters were obtained from the data base of Wilmore and Behnke in 1969 and 1970, the 

skinfolds from a data base not published of Yuhasz (Carter, 1996) and the rest of measures 

was obtained by Garret and the Kennedys in 1971. The result of these works lead until the 

table of the Phantom reference model.

When we want compute the distance between an object i and one sample, Z score like 

the transformation rule is defined that allows compute the absolute distance between both. Its 

calculation is made as the difference between value xi and the average of the sample, divided 

between standard deviation s of the sample:

The value of xi −  x  is equivalent to the proportionality equation (3), that indicates the

This  is  the  equation  that  is  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  proportional  distance 

between an individual i and a reference P respect to the variable variable1 being variable2 the 

proportionality base. Being the proportionality base, in many occasions, inherent part of the 

calculation method of the proportionality, gets used to omitting this subscript. 

Returning  to  the  example  of  the  model  of  human  proportionality  "Phantom",  the 

method that traditionally is applied for the calculation of Z scores uses as proportionality base 

to the height variable, that is to say, variable2 = height. On the other hand, since the height is 

a linear variable, n2 = 1 and therefore n = n1. That is to say, the explaining n agrees with the 

dimension of variable1. Thus, calling Ph to the reference model “Phantom”, the equation (5) 

is transformed into:

That  it  is  the  equation  used  in  kinanthropometric,  in  the  analysis  of  the 

proportionality, for the method "Phantom" of Ross and Wilson. 

The statistical interpretation of Z score in proportionality. 

 

From the statistic and under the assumption of normality of the referet model P, we 

found the interpretation of Z scores in proportionality. Let us suppose, at a first moment, that  

5

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

variable2(i) = variable2(P).  2 In this assumption we can rewrite the equation (5) of Zvariable;P 

(i) in the form:

That is to say, Z score in proportionality indicates, proportionally, the number of times 

that is greater or smaller the standard deviation than the difference between the value of the 

variable in object i and the reference P 

Then,  under  the  assumption  that  the  reference  P  is  distributed  of  normal  way 

(Gaussian),  the  value  of  Z  indicates  the  position  that  corresponds  to  the  object  within  the 

distribution function. This measurement of position, using a table of normal distribution, can 

be transformed easily into a value of percentile of the study object within the sample.  Table 3 

shows some examples of percentiles near zero.

In the example of the model of human proportionality "Phantom", nevertheless, this 

interpretation  is  only  a  first  approach  to  the  complete  interpretation  of  Z  score  because  the 

own model creates several problems.  

1.  By  construction,  the  Phantom  model,  theoretically  is  not  normal,  because  for  the 

calculation of the values of the variables was used a heterogeneous group formed by 

men and women of diverse ages (all adults) and ethnic groups. 

2.  Another  factor  of  not-normality  is  that  the  values  of  the  measured  variables  are 

always positive and therefore, exists a minimum value for each Z score: 

 

 

                                                           
2  From  this  section  we  will  consider  that  variable2  like  proportionality  base  is  something  inherent  to  the 
calculation  method  of  scores  Z  of  proportionality,  as  we  did  in  the  equation  of  the  model  of  human 
proportionality  "Phantom"  in  which  it  is  implied,  for  future  references,  that variable2  =  height  and is  omitted 
like subscript of Z.

Consequently,  the  interpretation  of  Z  score  of  the  Phantom  model  like  a  percentile, 

cannot  be  a  complete  interpretation,  but  only  a  first  approach  that  will  have  later  to  be 

clarified based on characteristics like: sex, age, diet, physical activity or ethnic group of the 

subject of study i. 

Causes for the change of the reference model 

in the proportionality analysis. 

One of the most important problems in the proportionality studies is the change from 

a  one  reference  model  to  another  one.  The  reason  that  these  transformations  suppose  a 

problem  is  because  the  results  of  Z  scores  in  two  different  reference  models  will  give  like 

result  values  of  different  Z  scores  and 

therefore  different  (although  compatible) 

interpretations. 

 

Indeed,  the  problem  resides  in  the  search  of  the  “compatibility  way”  of  the  made 

interpretations using different reference models.  Once found this way, we will be able to go 

from a one reference model to another one according to the interests. 

Another reason to look for this “compatibility way” is that some reference models do 

not  come  from  normal  samples  (as  it  happened  in  Phantom  model).    Nevertheless,  other 

reference models can give a precise statistical interpretation to Z scores when coming from 

normal samples. 

A universal reference model for proportionality supposes an advantage because all the 

studies  will  make  reference  to  the  same  standard  and  the  results  and  conclusions  will  be 

compatible. On the other hand, the interpretation of Z scores in universal models, which, in 

general, are heterogeneous, will be less precise and will require to clarify them. 

7

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On  the  other  hand,  the  particular  reference  models  of  homogenous  groups  will 

facilitate  values  of  very  precise  Z  scores  in  their  interpretation  although  their  results  and 

conclusions will not be general without a compatibility way. 

In the models of human proportionality, in addition to the model "Phantom" of Ross 

and  Wilson  we  can  find  reference  models  based  on  the  qualities  of  the  different  samples 

studied in the different scientific works.  Three types of particular reference models in human 

proportionality, each one divided by sex exist basically: 

•  Regional Models:  they are those that gather the own characteristics of a geographic 

zone which, due to the genetics, climate, diet and activity, marks in its population a 

characteristic proportionality.  They are classified by geographic regions and they are 

denoted like Reg(zone, sex).  

•  Sport  Prototypes:    they  correspond  to  the  own  values  of  each  sport.    Thus,  the 

prototype of athlete of weightlifting will be very different from the prototype of long-

distance  runner.    They  are  classified  by  sport  modalities  and  they  are  written  like 

 

 

Spt(model, sex). 

•  Ontogenic Models:  they correspond to the changes in the proportionality due to the 

age.  They are classified by age and they are denoted by Ont(age, sex). 

The compatibility way between the different reference models would allow to go from 

any  model  (regional,  ontogenic  or  sport)  to  the  Phantom  model  and  vice  versa,  so  that  the 

results and conclusions of the different studies can be generalized. 

Method for the change of the reference model 

 in the proportionality analysis. 

Let  us  suppose  that  we  have  two  reference  models  P  and  P’.    Immediately,  than  to 

replace in the equation (5) it is observed that, under the condition:

verifies to the equation: 

 Zvariable;P (i) ≈ Zvariable;P (P’) + Zvariable;P’ (i) 

The  expression  (8)  is  the  compatibility  way  looked  between  Z  scores  from  two 

different reference models.  That is to say, under the adapted relations between the reference 

models P y P’ given by the expression (7), proportionality Z scores respect to a one reference 

can  be  break  in  sum  of  Z  scores  respect  to  another  one  reference  plus  an  amount  that 

calculates like Zvariable;P (P’) in the equation (5).  The interpretation of Zvariable;P (P’) is the one 

of Z score respect to variable corresponding to the averages of the reference model P’ respect 

to the reference model P. 

That is to say, if P represents a universal reference model (general and heterogenous) 

and  P’  represents  a  particular  reference  model  (special  and  homogenous)  Zvariable;P  (P’) 

indicates the proportional variations due to the particularities of P’ respect to P. 

The  equation  (8)  can  be  understood  from  a  dispersion  graph  in  which,  Z  scores  are 

represented in the x-axis, whereas the variables are written in the y-axis.  This representation 

can be seen in graph 1.

In the case of the model of human proportionality: let us take an individual i with age 

= 7 years y sex = female with the variable triceps skin-fold = 8,7 cm and the height = 115,6 

cm. Looking for in the table of the Phantom model, for this variable we found: 

• 

triceps skin-fold (Ph) = 139,37 cm  

•  s triceps skin-fold (Ph) = 5,45 cm.  

A  simple  substitution  of  these  values  in  the  equation  (6)  gives  by  result  an  score: 

Ztriceps skin-fold; Ph (i) = –0,6001, that is to say, it folds of triceps is in the 27,42 percentile. 

At first sight, the physical interpretation of this result could be that this individual one 

shows  proportionally  far  below 

triceps  skin-folds  respect 

to 

the  Phantom  model.  

Nevertheless,  this  result  throws  a  doubt:    Are  the  values  obtained  for  individual  i  in 

proportion with a homogenous sample of individuals of the same characteristics?. 

In order to respond to this question we consulted an ontogenic model.  Let us suppose 

that we found the values: 

•  Triceps skin-fold(Ont(7,female)) = 8,95 cm; s triceps skin-fold (Ont(7,female)) = 2,51 cm.  

•  Height(Ont(7,female)) = 120,20 cm ; sheight(Ont(7,female)) = 4,44 cm.  

A substitution of these values in the equation (5) leads a: Z triceps skin-fold;Ont(7,femenino) (i) = 

0,0383  or  what  is  the  same  a  51,52  percentile.  That  is  to  say,  individual  i  shows  a  triceps 

skin-fold proportionally very similar to the average value for its age, although with respect to 

the reference model "Phantom" the result was smaller. 

 

 

When we calculated Z triceps skin-fold;Ph (Ont(7,female)) score can be found the reason of 

this discrepancy: its result is –0,6316, or what is the same, we found a 26,38 percentile. That 

is  to  say,  the  reference  model  Ont(7,  female),  in  triceps  skin-fold  shows  a  disproportion 

inherent or characteristic of the own individuals of the sample. 

This  event  is  known  as  alometric  growth  (each  part  of  the  anatomy  grows  at  a 

different speed) and it is what produces these differences between the values of different Z 

scores. Nevertheless, in human proportionality we are more interested in knowing Z score of i 

10

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect  to  the  Ont(7,  female)  that  respect  to  the  Phantom  model,  because  in  the  ontogenic 

models the alometrics changes are already assumed. 

 

 

 

 

On the other hand, like Ont(7,female) verified (7) equation, and : 

Z triceps skin-fold;Ph (Ont(7,female)) + Z triceps skin-fold;Ont(7,femenino) (i) = –0,5932 

is  approximately  equal  to  Ztriceps  skin-fold;  Ph  (i)  =  –0,6001  with  a  relative  error  1,13%, 

this example also serves to illustrate the equation (8). 

This  method  for  proportionality  analysis  by  means  of  change  from  a  one  reference 

model  to  another  one  in  human  proportionality  was  called  “scalable  model”  and  was 

proposed in 2005 in the XXII congress of Sociedad Anatómica Española in Murcia (Spain). 

Conclusion 

When we work in proportionality, with reference models, we are always between two 

commitments: What reference model must we use?: universal or particular. 

•  We  will  look  for  a  universal  reference  model  that  it  serves  in  a  great  population  so 

that  all  the  scientific  works  can  use  it  and  thus  to  be  able  to  share  the  results  and 

conclusions of each study. In return, the sample of reference universal model will be 

heterogeneous  and  its  distribution  will  be  not-normal,  making  difficult  the 

interpretation of Z scores. 

•  On  the  contrary,  particular  reference  models  will  work  with  specific  homogenous 

samples  for  the  differentiating  characteristics  of  the  population.  Calculated  Z  scores 

using  these  models  will  be  more  easily  interpretable  and  will  contribute  much 

information. In return, the results and conclusions obtained, using particular reference 

models our studies will not be directly generalizable to another studies. 

A good solution for this dilemma consists of publishing, in addition to the tables of 

universal  reference  models,  also  the  tables  of  special  reference  models,  so  that,  using  the 

equation (8) one score can be transformed into another. 

11

 

 

 

 

 

 

Distinguishing  to  the  case  of  the  human  proportionality,  it  would  be  necessary  to 

obtain and to publish tables of ontogenic, regional and sport models referring to allow to the 

study of the individual proportionality of the respect samples with their same characteristics 

and their generalization to universal model Phantom through the equation (8) to facilitate the 

interchange of results and conclusions between the different studies.

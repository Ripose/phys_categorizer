Abstract: The Method a Raman of spectroscopy studies allocation of molecules in ternary 
mix-crystals of a p-dibromobenzene of p-dichlorobenzene and p-bromochlorobenzene. It is shown, 
that  the  mutual  concentration  of  builders  depends  on  requirements  of  growing.  Was  possibly  as  a 
uniform modification of concentration of all builders along a specimen, and a wavy modification of 
concentration of two substances.

the  mechanism  of  propagation  the  knowledge 
of  regularity  of  allocation  of  impurity  on  a 
crystal  depending  on  requirements  of  growing 
is  necessary.  Real  crystals  contain  impurities. 
Besides  in  practice  mix-crystals  are  widely

knowledge  of  regularity  of  allocation  of 
impurities  on  a  crystal  is  necessary.  The 
knowledge of the mechanism of crystal growth 
also  enables  to  influence  it.  In  a  number  of 
operations  [1]  it  is  shown,  that  for  two-
component  solid  solutions  depending  on 
requirements  of  growing  of  single  crystals  on

interest  to  carry  out  analogous  examinations 
for  ternary  mix-crystals  and  whether  will

As  physical  properties  of  crystals  are 
largely defined by dynamics of a lattice which 
is extremely sensitive to structural changes and 
composition  of  crystals  that  a  method  Raman 

of  spectroscopy  is  rather  convenient  tool  of

Spectrums  of  the  lattice  oscillations  of

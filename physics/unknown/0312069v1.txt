In  this  paper,  the  reservoir  is  modeled  by  homogeneous  two-phase  media  based  on 

BISQ  model.  We  focus  on  the  effects  of  the  squirt  flow  on  the  fundamental  guided 

waves  propagation  in  borehole  embedded  in  saturated  porous  media  excited  by 

monopole, dipole and quadrupole point sources. The full waveforms acoustic logging in 

a  fluid-filled  borehole  are  simulated.  The  curves  of  velocity  dispersion,  attenuation 

coefficients  and  excitation  of  the  fundamental  guided  waves  have  shown  that  velocity 

dispersions are almost independent of the characteristic squirt flow length, attenuations 

of guided waves are enhanced due to the squirt flow, and excitations of guided waves 

are  decreased  due  to  the  squirt  flow.  It  is  possible  to  estimate  the  characteristic  squirt 

flow  length  by  attenuation  coefficients  of  the  guided  waves  from  acoustical  logging

1. Introduction 

 

    Both  velocity  and  attenuation  have  been  used  to  estimate  the  reservoir  parameters 

such as porosity and permeability from elastic waves in porous rocks. The development 

of rock acoustics models is important for the interpretation of field data. Biot’s theory 

(1956a,b)[1]  has  been  successfully  used  to  describe  some  basic  behavior  of  acoustic 

waves propagating in porous media, but it does not adequately describe the attenuation 

and dispersion of elastic waves in some reservoir rocks. Dvorkin et.al (1993,1994)[2,3] 

noticed  the  “squirt”  flow  (Mavko  and  Nur,  1975)  [4]  which  was  neglected  in  Biot’s 

model  and  incorporated  the  “squirt”  flow  mechanism  into  Biot’s  theory.  The  current 

combined  squirt-Biot  model  is  well  known  as  BISQ  model.  Many  scientists  have 

investigated  this  model,  and  they  extended  it  to  anisotropic  rocks  [5,6](Parra,  1997, 

Chen and Yang, 2002). However, only to study the waves in infinite porous media, we 

cannot know the effects of squirt flow on the guided waves associated with the interface 

in multiplayer media. The main purpose of this paper is to study the effects of the squirt 

flow  on  the  guided  waves  associated  with  the  interface  in  multilayer  media.  Actually, 

the  real  reservoir  usually  is  assumed  to  horizontal  multilayer  or  cylindrical  multilayer 

media. We applied this model to simulation of acoustical logging in borehole embedded 

in saturated porous media (cylindrical multiplayer system). We focus on investigation of 

the  effects  of  the  characteristic  squirt  flow  on  the  fundamental  guided  waves 

propagation in the borehole. Full waveforms computed using the discrete wavenumber

method are displayed in the time domain. And the dispersion, attenuation and excitation 

of  the  guided  waves-the  Stoneley  waves  and  the  pseudo-Rayleigh  mode,  the  flexural 

mode and screw mode are analyzed. 

2. Theoretical formulations 

    Let ( r

,θ

z,

) be the cylindrical coordinate system. The model consists of a fluid filled 

borehole  of  radius  a,  extending  to  infinity  in  the  z  direction,  embedded  in  a  radially 

semiinfinite  isotropic  porous  formation  saturated  by  a  Newtonian  viscous  fluid.  We 

consider multipole point sources defined by Schmitt [7]. The equations of motion in the 

porous formation are [1,8]

A  usual  monopole  (axisymmetric)  source  exites  two  types  of  waves.  They  are  the 

Stoneley waves and the pseudo-Rayleigh modes (Fig.1, we only show the fundamental 

modes,  the  higher  modes  is  not  plotted).  The  Stoneley  wave  (Sto.)  has  no  cutoff 

6 

frequency.  Its  phase  velocity  starts  at  zero  frequency  with  the  so-called  “tube  wave” 

velocity and slightly reversed dispersion. The pseudo-Rayleigh mode (pR1) have a low 

cutoff frequency. Its phase and group velocity starts at the formation shear velocity and 

deceases  with  frequency  toward  the  bore  fluid  velocity.  The  attenuation  exhibits  a 

strong intermediate maximum, correlated with the Airy phase (i.e., the minimum group 

velocity) of the mode and associated with the maximum of excitation of the mode. In 

fig.1a,  we  notice  that  both  phase  and  group  velocities  of  Stoneley  wave  and 

pseudo-Rayleigh mode are almost independent of the characteristic squirt flow length. 

However,  an  interesting  aspect  of  Fig.1b  is  that  the  effect  of  the  squirt  flow  is  to 

increase  the  attenuation  of  Stoneley  waves  and  pseudo-Rayleigh  mode,  relative  to  the 

no  squirt  flow  case.  Fig.1c  shows 

that  excitations  of  Stoneley  waves  and 

pseudo-Rayleigh mode are decreased due to the existence of squirt flow. Fig.2 displays 

the  synthetic  waveforms  at  three  different  receivers  at  increasing  distance  from  the 

transmitter  with  a  8kHz(a)  and  3kHz(b)  source  center  frequency.

R

  is  set  to  2mm.  At 

the low frequency, the fundamental mode-Stoneley wave is excited strongly than other 

waves,  so  the  full  waveform  is  mainly  Stoneley  wave.  We  can  easy  find  that  the 

maximum  amplitudes  of  Stoneley  waves  (Fig.2b)  and  pseudo-Rayleigh  mode  (Fig.2a) 

are  smaller  than  those  of  no  squirt  flow  case.  This  property  is  consistent  with  the 

excitation curves in figure.1c. In Fig.2b, we also can find that arrival time of Stoneley 

waves  is  almost  same  for  that  based  on  BISQ  model  and  Biot  model.  It  is  consistent 

with the dispersion curves in fig.1a. 

 

7 

 

 

 

    Figure 3 shows the dispersion, attenuation and excitation curves of the fundamental 

mode  (referred  to  as  the  flexural  mode)  excited  by  dipole  point  sources.  The  flexural 

waves  (Flex.)  are  associated  with  a  pure  bending  of  the  borehole.  Its  phase  velocity 

ranges from the formation shear velocity toward that of a Scholte wave (i.e., a Stoneley 

wave at a fluid-solid interface) at high frequencies. The excitation curves have a peak 

associated  with  the  Airy  phase  of  the  flexural  mode.  We  also  find  that  the  dispersion 

curve  of  flexural  mode  is  almost  independent  of  the  characteristic  squirt  flow  length, 

however,  the  attenuation  coefficient  is  increased  due  to  the  squirt  flow,  and  the 

excitation  is  decreased  due  to  the  squirt  flow.  Fig.4  displays  the  synthetic  waveforms 

with  a  8kHz(a)  source  center  frequency.

R

  is  set  to  2mm.  In  fig.4,  we  can  find  that 

arrival time of flexural waves is the same for that based BISQ model and Biot model. 

The  dispersion  curve  in  fig.2a  also  confirms  it.  The  maximum  amplitudes  of  flexural 

waves  based  on  BISQ  model  are  smaller  than  that  of  based  on  Biot  model.  It  also 

clearly shows that shear waves (S) is not affected by the squirt flow. 

    Similar to the dipole point sources, the quadrupole point sources excite a fundamental 

mode  (referred  to  as  the  screw  mode).  From  figure  5,  we  can  find  the  dispersion, 

attenuation  and  excitation  of  the  screw  mode  (Scr.)  are  analogous  to  those  of  the 

flexural  mode  (Fig.3)  with  a  shift  toward  to  higher  frequency.  We  find  that  the 

dispersion of screw mode is almost independent of the characteristic squirt flow length; 

8 

only very small difference can be seen around cut-off frequency at low frequencies. The 

attenuation coefficient is increased due to the squirt flow. Comparison of Fig.1 , Fig.3 

and  Fig.5  clearly  shows  similarity  among  the  dispersion,  attenuation  and  excitation  of 

the  pseudo-Rayleigh  mode,  flexural  mode  and  screw  mode.  In  fig.6,  we  can  find  that 

arrival time of screw waves is almost same for that based BISQ model and Biot model. 

The maximum amplitudes of screw waves based on BISQ model are smaller than that 

of  based  on  Biot  model.  We  can  find  that  shear  wave  (S)  is  not  affected  by  the  squirt 

flow again. 

4. Discussion 

 

 

 

BISQ  model  predicts  that  attenuation  of  fundamental  guided  waves,  which 

propagation in borehole embedded in porous formation, increases due to the squirt flow 

in  saturated  rock.  The  velocity  dispersions  of  guided  waves  are  not  sensitive  to  the 

characteristic  squirt  flow  length.  The  attenuation  coefficients  are  sensitive  to  the 

characteristic squirt flow length, which encourages us to estimate the squirt flow length 

from  the  guided  waves.  It  is  of  great  interest  in  the  inversion  of  guided  waves  (e.g. 

Stoneley wave, flexural wave and screw wave) attenuation from the acoustical logging 

data  for  the  estimation  of  the  characteristic  squirt  flow  length.  Of  course,  in  the  field, 

attenuation  is  much  more  difficult  to  measure  than  is  velocity.  Winkler  et.al.  [11] 

performed  laboratory  experiments  to  study  borehole  Stoneley  waves,  and  their  study 

9 

shows  the  laboratory  results  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  theoretical  predictions 

based  on  Biot  model.  Their  experimental  porous  rock  sample  (Berea  S.S.)  has 

intermediate  value  of  the  permeability  (

220

mD

).  However,  in  throughout  the  present 

paper,  we  assume  that  the  squirt  flow  phenomenon  only  occurred  in  those  saturated 

porous rocks with low permeability (we may say 

0 <κ

100

mD

). 

5. Concluding remarks 

    We focus on investigation of the effects of the squirt flow on the fundamental guided 

waves propagation in borehole surrounded by saturated porous media with squirt flow. 

The numerical full waveforms show that the squirt flow influence on the amplitude of 

guided waves. Attenuations of Stoneley waves, pseudo-Rayleigh waves, flexural waves, 

and screw waves are enhanced due to the existence of squirt flow, excitations of those 

fundamental  guided  waves  are  decreased  due  to  the  existence  of  squirt  flow,  and 

velocity  dispersions  of  guided  waves  are  almost  independent  of  squirt  flow.  It  is 

possible  to  estimate  the  characteristic  squirt  flow  length  by  attenuation  coefficients  of 

guided waves from acoustical logging data.

Introductory Note

Segmented  silicon  detectors  (microstrip  and  pixel  devices)  are  widely  used  in  High  Energy  Physics 
applications. Due to their unsurpassed quality they play a major role in the tracking area of present and future 
collider experiments. However in the forthcoming experiments at LHC and TESLA they are subject to extremely 
harsh hadronic resp. electromagnetic radiation environments thus threatening their operability.

In the past years considerable effort had been undertaken in order to improve the radiation tolerance of these 
devices and thus guarantee an operational lifetime of e.g. 10 years in the LHC inner detector. Most of this work 
had been carried out by the CERN-RD48 (ROSE) collaboration (1996-2000).  It had been shown that radiation 
damage  effects  in  silicon  detectors  could  be  considerably  reduced  by  using  a  defect  engineering  approach, 
consisting in an oxygen enrichment of the float zone wafers during detector processing. This technique is now 
employed e.g. in the ATLAS pixel and part of the strip layers. In future experiments like for an upgraded LHC 
(SLHC)  the  present  luminosity  of  1034 is  envisioned  to  be  increased  by  a  factor  of  10  and  hence  a  hadronic 
fluence integrated over the operational period will reach 1016 equivalent n/cm². Presently there are no techniques 
available  to  ensure  the  necessary  radiation  tolerance  of  tracking  detectors  up  to  such  high  values.  Possible 
improvements of the ROSE results as well as completely new approaches are necessary and will be the goal of 
the newly founded R&D collaboration CERN-RD50.

Our  group  is  engaged  in  long  term  R&D  projects  in  the  development  and  radiation  hardness  of  silicon 
detectors.  The  group  participated  in    RD48  and  is  presently  also  a  member  of  RD50.  Our  main  object  is  the 
systematic  investigation  of  damage  consequences  for  the  operation  of  silicon  detectors  and  its  complete 
understanding.  Although  considerable  improvement  had  been  achieved  in  the  systematic  analysis  of  radiation 
induced  changes  of  macroscopic  detector  properties  only  little  was  gained  so  far  in  the  correlation  with 
responsible  defects  on  the  microscopic  scale.  The  first  paper  in  this  report  gives  an  overview  of  the  present 
knowledge  as  resulting  largely  from  RD48-experiments  and  recent  own  upgrades  for  hadron  induced  damage. 
Both  confirmed  results  showing  the  improvements  to  be  gained  by  the  oxygen  enrichment  as  also  still  open 
questions in the available systematics are covered. As hadronic interactions give rise to both “cluster” and “point 
defects” in silicon, low energy electromagnetic irradiation can only produce point defects, offering a much more 
direct correlation between defect generation and detector performance. All other 3 papers are dealing with this 
issue.  In  the  second  one  we  investigate  existing  point  defects  in  as  processed  detectors  and  additional  defect 
formation after gamma irradiation. The last two paper are concentrating on a close correlation between gamma 
induced deep defects and their consequences for the detector performance. For the very first time it is shown that 
both the change of the effective doping concentration (depletion voltage) and the free charge carrier generation 
(reverse  current)  can  be  completely  understood  by  the  microscopically  investigated  formation  of  deep  defects, 
largely suppressed by oxygen enrichment. This is regarded to be a major breakthrough for the long searched for 
understanding  of  radiation  damage  and  will  hopefully  also  pave  the  road  for  an  optimum  of  radiation  tolerant 
detectors including hadronic damage.

The  Work  of  our  group  is  supported  by  the DFG (German Research Foundation) and BMBF (Ministry for 
Research).  Part  of  the  work  had  been  performed  in  collaboration  with  industry  (CiS  Erfurt),  supported  by  the 
BMWI (Ministry for Economy).

Abstract

Radiation damage effects in silicon detectors under severe hadron- and(cid:0)(cid:22)–irradiation are surveyed, focusing on 
bulk effects. Both macroscopic detector properties (reverse current, depletion voltage and charge collection) as 
also the underlying microscopic defect generation are covered. Basic results are taken from the work done in the 
CERN-RD48  (ROSE)  collaboration  updated  by  results  of  recent  work.  Preliminary  studies  on  the  use  of 
dimerized float zone and Czochralski silicon as detector material show possible benefits. An essential progress in 
the  understanding  of  the  radiation  induced  detector  deterioration  had  recently  been  achieved  in  gamma 
irradiation, directly correlating defect analysis data with the macroscopic detector performance.

Silicon pixel and microstrip detectors are today’s 
best choices for meeting the requirements of tracking 
applications  in  the  forthcoming  LHC  experiments. 
However,  due 
the  extreme  harsh  radiation 
environment the required prolonged operability poses 
an  unprecedented  challenge 
radiation 
tolerance.  At  the  expected  yearly  level  of  up  to 
several  1014 hadrons  per  cm²  during  the  foreseen  10 
years of operation the damage induced changes in the 
silicon bulk will cause an increase of both the reverse 
current and the necessary depletion voltage as well as 
a decrease of the charge collection efficiency. Using 
standard  silicon  material  and  present  detector 
technology these damage induced effects lead to not 
tolerable  deteriorations  in  the  detector  performance. 
Possible  strategies  for 
the  radiation 
hardness  of  these  devices  consist  of  using  suitable

improving 

by 

This  report  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  ROSE 
collaboration showing the appreciable improvements 
which  had  been  achieved  by  diffusing  oxygen  from 
the SiO2-Si interface into the silicon bulk after initial 
oxidation of the silicon wafers. This so called DOFZ 
(Diffusion  Oxygenated  Float  Zone)  technology  had 
proven  to  be  the  most  cost  effective  way  of 
adequately  modifying 
process 
technology (see section 4.1). 

standard 

the 

induced  bulk  damage 

In  the following different aspects  of hadron and 
gamma/lepton 
effects, 
originating  from  the  Non  Ionizing  Energy  Loss 
(NIEL)  are  summarized,  especially  comparing 
standard  with  oxygenated  silicon  detectors,  as 
extracted  from  numerous  publications  of  the  ROSE 
collaboration  [4].  In  contrast  to  bulk  effects  surface 
and  interface  related  changes,  produced  by  the 
ionizing  energy  loss  (radiation  dose),  play  a  minor 
role  for  lifetime  limitations  of  silicon  detectors.  The 
discussion of such effects can e.g. be found in [5].

2. Primary damage effects 

The  bulk  damage  in  silicon  detectors  caused  by  
hadrons  or  higher  energetic  leptons  respectively 
gammas  is  primarily  due  to  displacing  a  Primary 
Knock  on  Atom  PKA  out  of  its  lattice  site.  The 
threshold  energy  for  this  process  is  ~  25  eV.  Such 
single  displacements  resulting  in  a  pair  of  a  silicon 
interstitial  and  a  vacancy  (Frenkel  pair)  can  be 
generated  by  e.g.  neutrons  or  electrons  with  an 
energy above 175 eV and 260 keV respectively. Low 
energy  recoils  above  these  threshold  energies  will 
usually create fixed point defects. However for recoil 
energies above about 5 keV a dense agglomeration of 
defects  is  formed  at  the  end  of  the  primary  PKA 
track.  Such  disordered  regions  are  referred  to  as 
defect  clusters.  The  kinematic  lower  limits  for  the 
production  of  clusters  are  ~35  keV  for  neutrons and 
~8  MeV  for  electrons.  In  figure  1  the  simulation 
result for a 50 keV PKA (average recoil produced by 
1  MeV  neutrons)  is  shown,  clearly    distinguishing 
between  discretely  distributed  vacancies 
(point 
defects) and  dense  agglomerates  (clusters)  [6].  It 
should  be  noted  here  that  the  radiation  damage 
caused  by  Co-60  gammas  is  primarily  due  to  the 
interaction of Compton electrons having a maximum 
energy  of  only  1  MeV.  Hence  in  this  case  cluster 
production  is  not  possible  and the  damage  is 
exclusively due to point defects. 

Fig. 1.  Simulation results: Sample distribution of 
vacancies induced by a 50 keV recoil silicon atom; 
insert shows transverse projection [6].

Both  point  defects  and  clusters  can  have  severe 
effects  on  the  detector  performance,  depending  on 
their  concentration,  energy  level  and  the  respective 
electron and hole capture cross section. Defects with 
deep energy levels in the middle of the forbidden gap 
could act as recombination/generation centers and are 
hence  responsible  for  an  increase  of  the  reverse 
detector  current.  The 
removal  of  dopants  by 
the 
formation  of  complex  defects  as  well  as 
generation  of  charged  centers  changes  the  effective 
doping  concentration  and 
the  needed  operating 
voltage to fully deplete the detector thickness. Finally 
such  defects  could  also  act  as  trapping  centers 
affecting the charge collection efficiency.  In view of 
the LHC operational scenario it has also to be noted 
that  the  primary  produced  defects  may  be  subject  to 
changes after long term storage at room temperature. 
Such annealing effects may very likely be caused by 
changes  due  to  the  dissolution  of  clusters  releasing 
migrating  vacancies  and 
[7].  The 
observed time constants for such “reverse annealing” 
processes  are  rather  large  (for  standard  silicon  at 
room temperature e.g. ~ 1year).  A reliable projection 
of damage results on the LHC operational scenario is 
hence only possible if annealing effects are included 
comparable  to  those  expected  in  10  years  of  LHC 
operation.    This  task  had  been  successfully  attacked 
by  performing  studies  at  elevated  temperatures  thus 
accelerating  the  kinetic  effects  being  responsible  for 
such  long  term  changes.  Related  basic  studies  are 
found in [8-10].

3. NIEL scaling of bulk damage

and 

The 

preceding 

discussion 

numerous 
experimental observations have led to the assumption 
that  damage  effects  produced  in  the  silicon  bulk  by 
energetic  particles  can  be  described  as  being 
proportional  to  the  so  called  displacement  damage 
cross  section  D.  This  quantity  is  equivalent  to  the 
Non  Ionizing  Energy  Loss  (NIEL)  and  hence  the 
proportionality  between  the  NIEL-value  and  the 
resulting  damage  effects  is  referred  to  as  the  NIEL-
scaling  hypothesis  (for  deviations  to  this  rule  see 
section  4.5.1).  The  displacement  damage  cross 
section D is normally quantified in MeVmb, whereas 
the  NIEL-value  is  given  in  keVcm²/g.    For  silicon 

with  A=28.086  g/mol  the  relation  between  D  and 
NIEL is:

In  figure  2  the  normalized  NIEL  values  are 
plotted as function of energy. The data are taken from 
[14-17]. More recent calculations can be found in [6],  
[18].  NIEL  scaling  and  its  limitations  is  extensively 
discussed in [6]. Regardless of possible deviations in 
certain  cases,  the  NIEL  scaling  should  always  be 
applied as a first order approximation of  the damage 
efficiency.  Hence  it  is  useful  to  display  the  NIEL 
folded energy spectra for the most abundant particles 
(neutrons  and  pions)  in  the  LHC  experiments,  as 
done for the SCT region of ATLAS in figure 3 [12]. 
Finally  the  resulting  equivalent  fluences  as  function 
of radius are shown in figure 4. 

From figure 3 we conclude that reactor neutrons, 
ranging  mainly  from  1  to  10  MeV,  are  adequate  for 
reliable damage tests and that indeed irradiations with 
250  MeV  pions,  available  at  PSI-Villigen,  should 
result  in  similar  damage  as  expected  in  LHC.  Many 
of the past and present irradiation tests have however 
been  performed  using  the  23 GeV  proton  beam  at 
CERN-PS.  In  view  of  reliable  predictions  for  the 
LHC  performance  it  is  therefore  reassuring  that 
damage  results  from  23  GeV  proton  and  250  MeV 
pion  irradiation  agree  pretty  well,  if  proper  NIEL 
scaling is used.

the  damage 

The  key  idea  of  the  RD48  strategy  implied  that 
the  radiation tolerance of silicon can be improved by 
adequate  defect  engineering.  Defect  engineering 
involves the deliberate addition of impurities in order 
to 
formation  of 
electrically active defects. Based on early attempts at 
the  Instrumentation  Division  of  BNL  [19],  RD48 
relied  on  carbon  and  oxygen  as  the  key  ingredients 
for  reaching  this  goal  [1].  A  wide  range  of  oxygen 
and  carbon  concentrations  had  been  investigated 
using several different process technologies. 

induced 

It  was  finally  found  that  an  oxygen  enrichment 
can best be achieved by a post-oxidation diffusion of 
oxygen  into  the  silicon  bulk.  This  DOFZ  process 
(Diffusion  Oxygenated  Float  Zone)  has  been 
performed at temperatures between 1100 and 1200°C 
and  with  durations  between  several  hours  and  10 
days,  reaching  an  oxygen  concentration  between  1 
and 4.1017 O/cm³ (see also figure 23).

Practical applications are employing a diffusion at 
1150°C for 24-72h. The O-concentration reached this
way is around 2.1017 O/cm³, see figure 5.

the accumulated particle fluence. A recommendation 
for this task is its measurement after an annealing of 
80 min at 60°C. In this situation a
is independent of 
the  detailed  history  of  the  actual  irradiation.  The 
ROSE  adapted  value  is:  a 80/60 =  4.0.10-17 A/cm.  For 
an  annealing  temperature  of  80°C  the  same  value 
would  be  reached  after  an  annealing  time  of  ~10 
minutes [10, 25]. 

It  should  be  emphasized  that  the    bulk  current 
increase and its annealing function follow strictly the 
NIEL scaling. This and the observation, that the large 
current  values  cannot  be  explained  by  any  known 
discrete  point  defects  led  to  the  assumption  of  a 
cluster  related  effect.  The  correlation  with  the 
enhanced  density  of  double  vacancies  in  clusters  as 
observed  in  [25]  and  a  possible  interstate  charge 
transfer  mechanism,  as  proposed  in  [26],  are  likely 
explanations.    

4.3. effective doping and depletion voltage

This  equation  holds  not  only  for  the  original  n-
type  silicon  (donor  doped)  but  also  after  severe 
irradiation  when  the  effective  doping  concentration 
changes its sign by increased generation of “acceptor 
like” defects. In any case one can describe the change 
of the depletion voltage by the related change in |Neff| 
= |Nd – Na| with Nd and Na as the positively charged 
donor and negatively charged acceptor concentration.

Fig. 8.  Change of the effective doping concentration in standard 
silicon, as measured immediately after neutron irradiation.

 

The  result  of  a  first  systematic  study  of  the 
extremely  large  change  of 
|Neff|  as  measured 
immediately  after  irradiation  of    standard  silicon 
detectors is depicted in  figure 8 [8]. The not tolerable 
increase  of  the  needed  depletion  voltage  after  “type 
inversion”  had  then  been  the  major  impact  for 
radiation hardening.

term annealing in between [27]. The annealing steps 
(4 minutes at 80°C) are chosen such that the observed 
change in Neff corresponds to what would be expected 
after  about  10  days  at  20°C.  Thus  the  operational 
LHC  scenario  can  be  approximated  this  way.  The 
chosen  annealing  time  corresponds  also  to  the 
minimum  of  the  annealing  curve  as  measured  for 
80ºC  and  is  therefore  closely  related  to  the  “stable 
component” of the change in Neff (see below).

Figure  9  shows  a  comparison  between  standard, 
carbon- and oxygen enriched silicon as irradiated by 
23  GeV  protons  at  the  CERN  PS  irradiation  facility 
[27]. It is clearly seen, that the O-enrichment reduces 
the  change  in  Neff  and  likewise  in  the  depletion 
voltage considerably to about 1/3 of that for standard 
silicon  while  carbon-enrichment  proves  to  have  an 
adverse effect. However, although pion and proton

material, neutron damage does not result in a similar 
improvement,  see  figure  10  [27].  This  discrepancy 
with the simple NIEL scaling assumption (section 3) 
is  often  been  referred  to  as  the  “p-n-puzzle”.  A 
discussion  of this point will be given in section 4.5.1.

4.3.2. Annealing experiments and modeling

As  already  mentioned,  the  CERN  scenario  tests 
allow only the measurement of one relevant damage 
parameter,  namely the change of the effective doping 
concentration  around  the  minimum  of  the  annealing 
function. A different but much more time consuming 
approach,  introduced  by  the  Hamburg  group,  uses  a 
set  of  diodes  which  are  irradiated  individually  with 
different  fluences  and  are  then  subjected  to  full 
annealing  cycles  at  an  elevated  temperature  for 
accelerating  the  annealing  kinetics  (see  [13]  and 
literature cited there). The result of such an annealing 
experiment  is  shown  in  figure  11.  D Neff
is  the 
damage  induced  change  in  the  effective  doping 
concentration:

D Neff consists of three components, a short term

the  reverse  annealing  component  NY.  Both  time 
constants  for  the  beneficial  as  well  as  reverse 
annealing  depend  strongly  on  the  temperature.  A 
more  detailed  discussion  can  be  found  in  [10,  13]. 
Recent  results  for  the  stable  damage  component  NC
have  shown  that  there  is  no  pronounced  difference 
between  a  moderate  24  h  and  an  enlarged  72  h 
oxygen  diffusion  and  in  fact  the  improvement  with 
respect  to  standard  material  is  also  only  marginal  as 
to  be  seen  in  figure  12  [20].  This  surprising  effect 
will be further discussed in section 4.6.

A  much  more  general  behavior  regarding  the 
DOFZ  benefits  is  seen  for  the  reverse  annealing 
amplitude.  Standard  silicon  reveals  an  almost  linear 
behavior of the reverse annealing amplitude NY with 
fluence while DOFZ silicon shows strong saturation

increased  time  constant  [1,  20]  offer  an  additional 
safety margin for detectors kept at room temperatures 
every year during maintenance periods. As shown in 
[20]  and  documented  in  figure  13,  the  difference 
between  24  and  72  h  O-diffusion  is  again  not  very 
large. It is however interesting that there are, contrary 
to  previous  investigations,  also  some  benefits  after 
neutron irradiation.

thus  may  underestimate  the  beneficial  DOFZ  effect 
according to recent results as shown in figure 13 (see 
also [20]). The actual values seem also to depend on 
the  individual  manufacturing  process  (see  section 
4.5).  It  should  also  be  mentioned  that  annealing 
experiments  have  to  include  a  long  known  bi-stable 
effect [28]. Thus final conclusions can only be drawn 
after  some  proper  quality  assurance  check  of    the 
actual detectors.

4.4. Charge collection efficiency

For  any  application  of  silicon  detectors  in  vertex 
detectors the prime focus is on the operating voltage 
needed to guarantee a sufficiently good S/N ratio for 
detection of mip’s. The signal noise is controlled by 
operating  the  detectors  at  low  temperature  (–10°C). 
Such, a good charge collection efficiency is then the 
prime  objective.  For  best  performance  full  depletion 
of the detector thickness is needed and therefore the 
considerations  outlined  in  section  4.3  are  of  great 
importance.  However, in order to keep trapping and 
ballistic deficit effects low, the operating voltage has 
to be even larger than the depletion voltage. 

Fig. 15.  Annealing curves as measured from charge collection 
(open symbols) and C/V-measurements (closed ones).

Measurements  of  charge  collection  in test diodes 
b -sources  and  long 
have  been  performed  with 
wavelength infrared laser light pulses, which ensure a 
near mip like charge track generation throughout the 
depth of the device (see e.g. [29]). Other experiments 
have  used  short  wavelength 
laser  beams 
illuminating  the  test  diode  from  either  p+ or  n+ side 
for investigation of the electron resp. hole dominated 
pulse  signals  separately.  This  allows  the  study  of 
charge carrier trapping effects and these results could 
then again be included in model calculations for LHC 
or other applications [30-33].

The  analysis  of  charge  collection  as  function  of 
bias  voltage  should,  similar  to  capacitance/voltage 
measurements, also reveal the depletion voltage. It is 
reassuring that in fact both techniques have led to the 
same  results  (figure  15)  [1].  Examples  of  time 
resolved  signal  pulse  shapes  are  shown  in  figure  16 
[1].  The  double  peaking  is  attributed  to  a  double

generally  observed effect and still needs its complete
explanation, a likely explanation as also other details 
of the signal shape are discussed in [34, 35].

The  application  of  charge  collection  results  as 
obtained  with  test  diodes  to  segmented  detectors  is 
not straight forward but incorporates  a more complex 
calculation involving the geometrical structure of the 
detector by using a “weighting field”. This point had 
long  been  neglected  and  only  recently  caught  more 
attention, for detailed discussion see [36].

4.5. Microscopic understanding of damage effects

have 

investigations 

Systematic  studies  for  defect  engineering  are 
finally only possible if the correlation between defect 
formation  and  the  detector  performance  would  be 
known.  Numerous 
been 
undertaken  for  characterization  of  damage  induced 
defects  in  detector  grade  silicon,  especially  using 
DLTS (Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy) and TSC 
(Thermally  Stimulated  Current)  techniques,  showing 
a  lot  of  relevant  results  [9,  10,  25,  37-40].  A 
promising correlation has been reported between the 
cluster  formation  as  visible  in  the  double  vacancy 
defect  and  the  damage  related  current  [25].  Other 
studies  have  given  a  lot  of  detailed  information  of 
the  changes  during 
defect  kinetics  visible 
prolonged  annealing  or  as  function  of  temperature 
(see e.g. [9, 10, 37]). However despite many partially 
useful  attempts  it  was  so  far  not  possible  to 
quantitatively  fully understand  the  (macroscopic) 
such 
detector  performance  on 
(microscopic)  data.  In  the  following  two  examples 
are given, which are regarded to be promising in this 
respect.

4.5.1. p-n puzzle, violation of NIEL scaling

As  outlined  in  section  3,  originally  all  damage 
effects had been assumed to be simply proportional to 
the  displacement  damage  cross  section  and  hence  to 
obey  a  universal  behavior    not  depending  on  the 
particle  type  and  energy  if  NIEL  scaling  is  applied. 
NIEL  scaling  is  still  valid  for  the damage  induced 
bulk  generation  current  of  high  energy  hadron 
irradiated  detectors  (section  4.2)  but  is  strongly 

violated  for  the  change  of  the  effective  doping 
concentration (see section 3, figure 10 and 13).

MeV protons).

Although this so called proton-neutron puzzle is 
still  not  completely  understood, 
the  following 
remarks  may  be  useful.  Figure  17  shows  the 
experimental  results  of  point  defect  generation  rates 
after  n-,  p- and  pion  irradiation  [25].    The  double 
vacancy  defect  E4  is  surely  related  to  cluster 
formation  while  E2  is  composed  of  the  A-center 
(VOi)  and  a  carbon  complex  (CiCs),  both  being 
the  ratio  of 
discrete  point  defects.  Therefore 
g(E2)/g(E4)  measures  the  point  defect  generation 
with  respect  to  cluster  formation.    These  findings 
may  be  compared  with  the  simulation  results  shown 
in figure 18 [6].

12

the  production  of  cluster 

1  MeV  neutron  damage  is  obviously  dominated 
by 
like  vacancy 
agglomerates with typical dimensions of 100Å or less 
while  high  energy  protons  lead  to  an  additional 
concentration  of 
isolated  and  homogeneously 
distributed vacancies and interstitials, responsible for 
point  defects.  The  p-n-puzzle  is  just  a  result  of  the 
different  primary  interactions,  which  are  in  the  case 
of  neutrons  caused  by  hard  core  nuclear  scattering 
with  energy  transfers  likely  larger  than  the  cluster 
formation  threshold  of  5  keV.  For  charged  hadrons 
the  Coulomb interaction  prevails  leading  to  much 
lower recoil energies below the cluster threshold thus  
responsible for more point defects. This clear picture 
may have to be changed if high energy pion or proton 
damage  would  be  compared  to  that  produced  by 
neutrons  with  much  larger  energies  than  those 
accessible  in  reactors.  In  fact  the  neutron  energy 
spectrum  in  the  inner  detector  of  LHC  experiments 
covers  a  range  up  to  about  100  MeV  (figure  3).  At 
this  energy  secondary  nuclear  reaction  products  as  
e.g.  .-particles,  protons  and  even  those  with  larger 
mass  could  contribute  to  low  energy  recoils  due  to 
their  Coulomb  interaction  much  more  than  resulting 
from  1  MeV  neutrons  (elastic  nuclear  scattering 
only).  Thus  the  p-n-puzzle  could    indeed  be  less 
pronounced  if  damage  studies  would  be  performed 
with  higher  energetic  neutrons.  As  a  result,  if  the 
DOFZ  related  benefits  are  closely  related  to  point 
defect  formation  as  it  presently  looks  (see  next 
section),  the  actual  neutron  damage  for  the  tracking 
detectors  might  also  be  reduced  by  using  DOFZ 
silicon.

4.5.2. microscopic picture of gamma induced damage
Although  a  lot  of  microscopic  investigations  on 
defect  generation  induced  by  hadron  irradiation  had 
been performed, it has yet not been possible to relate 
the macroscopic change in Neff to any such defects in 
a  quantitative  way.  The  long  suspected  candidate 
which  could  explain  also  the  improvement  obtained 
by  oxygen  enrichment  is  the  acceptor  like  V2O-
center,  a  deep  defect  in  the  middle  of  the  forbidden 
gap [41]. In contrast to hadron irradiation low energy
gamma damage leads only to the generation of point 
defects  revealing  a  much  cleaner  picture  not 
complicated  by  cluster  effects.  Co-60  g -irradiation 
studies have shown that the improvement obtained

with  DOFZ  silicon  is  in  this  case  much  more 
pronounced  than  observed  after  hadron  irradiation 
[42].  Only  recently  a  defect  had  been  measured  by 
DLTS  and  TSC 
to  be 
identified as the  long searched V2O center [43, 44]. 
Its generation is largely suppressed in DOFZ silicon, 
see  figure  19.  Effective  doping  concentration  does 
not  show  any  type  inversion  as  seen  in  standard 
material,  see  figure  20.  Using  the  analyzed  defect 
parameters as function of the gamma dose it was then 
shown  that  both  the  change  in  the  effective  doping 
concentration and reverse current of standard silicon 
detectors can largely be attributed to the generation of 
the  V2O  center  [45].  This  result  can  rightfully  be 
regarded  as  an  absolute  first  in  the  long  and 
sometimes frustrating search for an understanding of 
macroscopic damage effects by defect analysis.

4.6. Open questions

Although it looks that the final results have led to 
an almost universal recipe for improving the radiation 
tolerance  in  a  predictable  way  and  a  possibility  to 
perform  projections  to  any  operational  scenario,  a 
number of problems remain still open. 

One  of  the  most  asked  questions  is:  how  much 
oxygen is enough? New results suggest that the main 
positive effect is already achievable with a diffusion 
for 24 hours at 1150°C ([20], see figures 12 and 13). 
However  such  a  short  diffusion  process  leads  to  a 
pronounced non-homogeneity in the depth profile of 
the O-concentration (see figure 5), the effect of which 
is  not  yet  known.  A  detailed  comparison  with  the 
BNL  HTLT  (High  Temperature  Long  Time)  DOFZ 
process  resulting  in  a  homogeneous  oxygen  depth 
profile would be very interesting [46].

Most 

test  damage  experiments  have  been 
performed  with  irradiations  of  diodes  at  room 
temperature and  unbiased and hence much different 
from the actual situation. Only in a few cases the real 
operational  conditions  (-10ºC  and  under  bias)  had 
been  included.  Examples  are  reported  e.g.  in  [47], 
[48].  More  systematic  studies  are  needed,  especially 
with proton resp. pion irradiation.

A  worrying  result  of  principal  importance  is 
illustrated in figures 21 and 22 [49]. CERN scenario 
experiments  with  different  material  have  shown  that 
the  “stable  damage”  component  as  function  of 
fluence varies widely for standard FZ silicon (figure 
21),  whereas  for  DOFZ  silicon    the  variations  are

Fig. 23.  Depth profiles for oxygen enrichment obtained by 
different DOFZ processes at various manufacturers: ST: ST 
Microelectronics (Italy), SINTEF (Norway), CiS (Germany). The 
bottom 2 curves are for a standard oxidation process, all others 
diffusion oxygenated as labelled.

Another  riddle  is  displayed  in  figures  23  and  24 
[50].  Here  the  correlation  between  the  oxygen 
enrichment  and  its  results  for  the  saturation  of  the 
reverse  annealing  is  demonstrated.  In  general  one 
observes the expected effect: a larger O-concentration 
leads to lower reverse annealing amplitudes. E.g. the 
standard  ST  Microelectronics  process  (bottom  most 
lowest  O-
curve

curve  in  figure  24).  Also  the  ST-process  with  the 
largest O-concentration (30h at 1200°C, top curve in 
figure  23)  results  in  the  best  reverse  annealing 
performance  (bottom  most  curve  in  figure  24). 
Although  the  CiS  process  (16h  at  1150°C,  3rd curve 
from  bottom  in  figure  23)  and  the  SINTEF  process 
(72  resp.  80h  at  1150°C,  4th and  5th from  bottom  in 
figure  23)  show  the  expected  difference  in  the  O-
concentration  ,  the  reverse  annealing  obtained  with 
the CiS diodes (2nd from bottom in figure 24) is better 
than  that  for  the  SINTEF  process  (3rd and  4th from 
bottom in figure 24). This quite confusing result may 
be  understood  by  differences  induced  from  the 
individual  process.  Characterization  of  the  material 
after  processing  is  therefore  urgently  needed,  an 
example is given in [51].

5. Recent studies for improvements 

interstial 

The  normal  oxygen  enrichment  via  the  DOFZ 
process makes use of the diffusion of oxygen present 
as  single  atoms  on 
lattice  sites.  A 
modification  had  been  introduced  by  the  Brunel 
group  generating  oxygen  dimers  (2  closely  related 
interstitial  O-atoms).  First  damage  studies  with  such 
material have shown promising results with evidence 
for the reduction of cluster related damage [52].

The  BNL  group,  using  their  HTLT  technique 
have  additionally doped  the  material  with  thermal 
donors.  An  appreciable 
improvement  had  been 
reported  showing  no  increase  of  the  stable  damage 
component  of  Neff at  proton  fluences  above  2(cid:215) 1014
p/cm² [46].
Finally 

the  Hamburg  group  had  performed 
damage  tests  with  diodes  fabricated  from  high 
resistivity    Czochralski  silicon,  which  has  an  as 
grown O-concentration of 8(cid:215) 1017/cm³ (see also figure 
5),  much  larger  than  possible  with  any  DOFZ 
process.  First  damage  experiments  with  pion  and 
proton irradiation have shown no type inversion after 
large fluences, an effect which is in contrast to all FZ 
results  and  could  indeed  be  very  profitable  for 
detector applications [20].

6. Conclusions

• Diffusion  oxygenation  of  float  zone  silicon 
(DOFZ) has proven to be a powerful technique for 
reducing  damage  effects 
in  silicon.  Model 
parameterization  of  damage  effects  allows  the 
calculation  of  detector  performance for long term 
LHC operation. 

• The  DOFZ  method  had  been  successfully 
transferred  to  several  detector  manufacturers.  It 
will  be  used  for  part  of  LHC  strip  and  pixel 
detectors. 

• There  are  still  a  number  of  open  questions 
regarding the ROSE results. Among them are: 
Optimization  of  the  O-enrichment,  a  possible 
dependence of damage effects on the initial silicon 
material and on the individual process technology. 
• Recent  updates  of  ROSE  results  have  shown  that 
the DOFZ process reveals also benefits for neutron 
irradiation.  It  is  argued  that  these  will  even  be 
larger  if  tests  would  extended  to  higher  neutron 
energies, relevant for the LHC tracking area.

• An  absolute  first  in  understanding  the  diode 
performance on a microscopic level is reported for 
Co-60 gamma irradiated silicon.

• New studies have shown further improvements for 
the  radiation  tolerance  of  silicon  by  oxygen 
thermal 
dimerization,  dedicated  doping  with 
float  zone  with 
donors  and  by 
Czochralski grown silicon.  

replacing 

• Finally  it  should  be  mentioned  that  a  new 
international  collaboration  had  been  initiated  and 
approved by CERN as RD50, which will focus on 
the  development  of  radiation  hard semiconductor 
devices for very high luminosity colliders [53].

Abstract

Deep defect levels in standard and oxygen enriched silicon 
detectors before and after 60Co-g - irradiation†

Capacitance  Deep  Level  Transient  Spectroscopy  (C-DLTS)  measurements  have  been  performed  on  standard  and  oxygen 
doped  silicon  detectors  manufactured  from  high  resistivity  n-type  float  zone  material  with  <111>  and  <100>  orientation. 
Three  different  oxygen  concentrations  were  achieved  by  the  so-called  DOFZ  process  (diffusion  oxygenated  float  zone) 
initiated by the CERN-RD48 (ROSE)-collaboration. Before the irradiation a material characterization has been performed. In 
contrast to radiation damage by neutrons or high energy charged hadrons, were the bulk damage is dominated by a mixture of 
clusters and point defects, the bulk damage caused by  60Co-g -radiation is only due to the introduction of point defects. The 
dominant electrically active defects which have been detected after 60Co-g -irradiation by C-DLTS are the electron traps VOi, 
CiCs, V2(=/-), V2(-/0) and the hole trap CiOi. The main difference between standard and oxygenated silicon at low dose values 
can be seen in the introduction rate of CiCs compared to CiOi. For highly oxygenated silicon the introduction of CiCs is fully 
suppressed, while the sum of the introduction rates g(CiCs) + g(CiOi) is independent on the oxygen concentration.

1. Introduction 

The CERN RD48 (ROSE) [1,2] collaboration had 
shown  that  oxygen  enrichment  of  the  silicon  bulk 
leads  to  a  considerable decrease  of  damage  effects, 
g -
induced  primarily  by  charged  hadrons  and 
irradiation.    But  so  far  it  had  been  shown,  that  the 
observed  changes  of  the  macroscopic  properties like 
the  change  of  the  effective  doping  concentration  as 
well as the leakage current cannot be fully explained 
by  the  dominant  induced  defects,  which  have  been 
investigated  by  DLTS-,  TSC- and  other  methods    
[3-6].

In this work we report on DLTS-studies on 60Co-
g - irradiated  silicon  detectors  in  order  to  avoid  the 
complications  caused  by the  generation  of  clusters 
and  to  search  for  possible  defects,  which  might  be 
responsible

2 Experimental procedures

2.1. DLTS

The  measuring  method,  which  has  been  mainly 
used  in  this  work,  is  the  Capacitance-Deep-Level-
Transient-Spectroscopy (C-DLTS), which was at first 
introduced  by  D.V.  Lang  [7].  The  principle  of  this 
method  is  based  on  the  temperature  dependence  of 
the  emission  process  of  trapped  charge  carriers  in 
defect centers in the space charge region of a reverse 
biased  diode.  For  an  isolated  defect  level  the 
emission  process  is  an  exponential  function  in  time 
with a single emission time constant and is measured 
via  the  corresponding  space  charge  capacitance 
transient.  In  our  DLTS-system  a  Fast  Fourier 
Transformation  is  applied  to  the  measured  transient 
for data reduction and evaluation of the emission time 
constant and trap concentration [8]. Performing a so-

concentrations  by  using 

the  application  of  this  method  is  limited  by  the 
requirement that the concentration of traps NT has to 
be 
shallow  doping 
to 
concentration NS. This limit can be pushed to higher 
trap 
the  Constant-
Capacitance-DLTS  (CC-DLTS)  technique  [9].  Here 
the  capacitance  of  the  space  charge  region  is  kept 
constant  by  using  a  feedback  scheme  in  the  bias 
voltage-capacitance  measurement  system  and  the 
change of the bias voltage in the feedback loop is the 
DLTS-signal.

For  DLTS  peaks,  which  correspond  to  defect 
levels  with  similar  activation  energies  and  capture 
cross  sections  a special  deconvolution  technique, 
developed  by  the  company  PhysTech  [10]  had  been 
used.

In general the  CDLTS spectra had been obtained 
with  a time window of TW = 200 ms, a filling pulse 
duration  of  tfill = 100 ms and a reverse bias of UR = 
20 V.

2.2 Material

The  p+nn+  diodes  investigated  in  this  work  are 
manufactured from high resistivity (r =3-4 kW cm) n-
type float zone (FZ) silicon grown in the <111> and 
<100>  direction  from  Wacker.  The  processing  and 
oxygen  enrichment  has  been  performed  by  the 
company CiS [11]. The oxygen doping was achieved 
by  diffusion  for  24h,  48h  and  72h  at  1150°C  in 
nitrogen.  This  oxygenated  material  will  be  named 
DOFZ while the standard material will be labeled as 
STFZ. A detailed description of the material is given 
in [12].

Fig. 1 CDLTS measurements of electron and hole traps in an 
oxygenated (24h) <100> sample before irradiation

One of these defects is the so-called thermal double 
donor TD. The introduction of TD's depends strongly
on the oxygen concentration [13]. As can be seen in 
table  2  the  amount  of  TD's    is  correlated  with  the 
oxygen content of the differently oxygenated devices, 
but  the  concentrations  in  the  material  with  <100> 
orientation  (CF-CH)  are  smaller  compared  to  the 
material  with  <111>  orientation.  There 
is  no 
measurable  amount  of  thermal  donors  observed  in 
STFZ-material (Wafers CA and CE). 

The  other  four  defects  are  so  far  unknown.  The 
electron  trap  E(120)  appears  only  in  oxygenated 
<100> material. This defect has an activation energy 
and  capture  cross  section  which  are  close  to  the 
values  of  the  double  charged  state  of  the  divacancy 
V2(=/-) as will be shown later.

The defect E(240) is a very deep level and from its 
properties  this  level  is  mainly  responsible  for  the 
measured generation current.

H(160)  is  a  hole  trap.  It  was  just  visible  in  the 
<100> wafer with 24h oxygenation by optical carrier 
injection.

H(220)  is  also  a  hole  trap.  It  was  already  seen  in 
former material investigations [5]. The concentration 
of  this  defect  is  independent  of  the  oxygenation 
concentration  and  orientation  of  the  wafer,  but 
depends on the position of the diode on the wafer, i.e. 
the concentration increases with the distance from the 
center  of  the  wafer  to  the  edge.  According  to the 
material  investigation  the  <111>  material  contains 
less defects than the <100> material.

2.3. Irradiation

Irradiations  had  been  performed  at  the  high 
intensity  60Co-g -source  of  the  Brookhaven  National 
Laboratory  (BNL)  in  the  US  at  room  temperature. 
The samples were irradiated for this investigation in a 
dose range from 0.2 Mrad up to 10 Mrad.

A  search  for  process-induced  defects  had  been 
performed  before  irradiation.  Five  different    defect 
levels have been discovered in the material.

As  an  example  figure  1 shows DLTS spectra for 
electron  and  hole  injection.  The  properties  of  these 
defects  are  listed  in  table  1,  their  concentrations  are 
listed in table 2.

3.2. Radiation induced defects

The  irradiation  with  a  60Co-g -source  has  the 
advantage that only point defects and no clusters are 
generated,  while  an  irradiation  with  hadrons  would 
also cause clusters. In figure 2 a DLTS-spectrum is

detector irradiated with 0.5 Mrad

interstitial)  and 

shown  for  a  standard  detector  irradiated  with  a  dose 
of 0.5 Mrad. The small peak at about 60 K is caused 
by  the  thermal  double  donor  TD  already  observed 
before irradiation. The dominant peak at 85 K can be 
attributed  to  the  creation  of  the  VOi (vacancy  + 
oxygen 
(carbon 
interstitial  +  carbon  substitutional,  state  A)  defects, 
while  the  small  peaks  at  120  K  ant  200  K  are 
associated  with  the  different  charge  states  of  the 
divacancy (V2(=/-) and V2(-/0)). The superposition of 
the  VOi and  the  CiCs signal  at  85  K  cannot  be 
resolved  by  high  resolution  techniques,  since  their 
activation  energies  and  capture  cross  sections  are 
nearly  identical.  But  measurements  of  the  amplitude 
of  the  DLTS  signal  as  function  of  the  filling  pulse 
duration tfill at constant temperature allow to separate 
the  signals  arising  from  the  CiCs(A)  and  VOi by 
making use of the bistability of the CiCs defect[4] as 
demonstrated  in  figure  3  (upper  curves).  The  first 
increase  corresponds  to  the  filling  of  the  VOi while 
the  second  one  reflects  the  configurational  change 
from  state  CiCs(B)  to  state  CiCs(A).  For  this  change 
an  activation  energy  has  to  be  overcome  and 
therefore  the  tfill value  at  which  this  step  occurs

oxygenated  material  the  CiCs defect  is  strongly 
suppressed. For the extraction of the level parameters 
and 
the  double  charged 
divacancy    V2(=/-)  in  the  <100>  material  this  defect 
had  to  be  separated  from  the  material  defect  that 
appears  at  the  same  temperature  in  the  spectra  as 
mentioned  before.  This  was  possible  by  using  the 
high resolution DLTS method. As an example figure 
4  shows  the  measurement  of  the  DLTS  signal  as 
function of the transient time window (open squares) 
and  the  separation  of  both  levels  by  a  special 
refolding technique (solid line) [10]. Measurements

at  different  temperatures  result  in  the  corresponding 
Arrhenius plot demonstrated in figure 5. Here level 1 
corresponds to the material defect E(120) while level 
2  is  attributed  to  the  V2(=/-)  level.  Figure  6  shows 
spectra  for  the  hole  trap  CiOi for  samples  irradiated 
with different doses up to 10 Mrad. As can be seen in 

Fig. 6 CDLTS spectrum after hole injection for STFZ samples 
irradiated with different doses

the spectra the peak shifts slightly for higher doses to 
lower  temperatures  which  is  mainly  caused  by  the 
fact  that  the  concentration  of  this  defect  exceeds 
already  at  4  Mrad  the  shallow  doping  concentration 
and  thus  the  DLTS  requirement  is  not  fulfilled 
anymore.  The  activation  energies  and  the  capture 
cross sections of all radiation induced trap levels are 
summarized  in  table  3  and  compared  with  values 
given in [4].

manufactured  from  <111>  and  <100>  material.  For 
the  creation  of  VOi no  dependence  on  the  oxygen 
concentration is seen while the generation of CiCs
is 
in  oxygenated  material.  This 
fully  suppressed 
suppression  is  due  to  the  fact  that  in  oxygen  rich 
material  the  probability  of  the  reaction  Ci +  Oi :
CiOi is much larger compared to the reaction Ci + Cs 
: CiCs.  But  it  is  expected  that  the  sum  of  the 
introduction  rates  g(CiCs)+g(CiOi)  stays  constant  for 
all materials. This holds with the exception observed 
for  the  standard  <100>  material  (device  CE)  which 
shows a slightly lower introduction rate.

introduction rate for both charge states should be the

reflects the primary generation of silicon interstitials I 
via the Watkins replacement mechanism I+ Cs : Si(cid:0)(cid:0)
Ci and the subsequent formation of CiCs and CiOi , the 
sum of the introduction rates g(CiCs) + g(CiOi) should 
be equal to the total introduction of Interstitials g(I). 
On  the  other  hand  each  primary  interaction  will 
create  the  same  number  of  vacancies  and  hence  the 
total  number  of  vacancy  related  defects  should 
balance the interstitial related ones. As a consequence 
the  following  equation  for  the  introduction  rates 
should be fulfilled.

This relation holds for <111> material with a ratio 
of 0.91 +/- 0.12 but for <100> material the extracted 
ratio of 0.71 +/- 0.02 is too small. An explanation of 
such a small value can so far not be given.

All these defects descibed above are well known 
and  characterized,  but  they  still  cannot  explain  the 
macroscopic properties  like  the  increase  in  the 
leakage  current  and  the  change  in  the  effective 
doping.  In  recent  studies  of  our  group  on  these 
devices at larger doses a close to midgap level at EC-
0.545 eV was observed which can mainly explain the

4. Conclusions

After 

irradiation  with  60Co-g -

radiation  we 
observed  for  the  different  materials  the  dominant 
introduction of carbon and oxygen related defects and 
a  much  smaller  generation  of  divacancies. The main 
influence of oxygen in the defect formation is seen in 
the formation of CiCs and CiOi where already oxygen 

21

is  seen 

enriched material by a diffusion of 24 h shows a full 
suppression  of  the  CiCs defect.  In  this  report  no 
difference 
in  material  with  different 
orientation.  For  the  creation  of  divacancies  the 
introduction  rate  is  about  two  orders  of  magnitude 
smaller  compared  to  the  creation  of  impurity  related 
defects  and  a  very  small  dependence  on  the  oxygen 
concentration  was  observed.  A  difference  between 
<111> and <100> material had only been established 
in the ratio of introduction rates for interstitial related 
defects.  All  of  these  defects  seen  by  DLTS  in  the 
investigated  dose  range  are  not  responsible  for  the 
change of the macroscopic device properties. Only a 
recently  detected  deep  level  close  to  midgap  can 
explain the macroscopic parameters.

Abstract

The  influence  of  oxygen  in  silicon  on  bulk  damage  effects  induced  by  60Co-gamma  irradiation  has  been  studied  in  a  dose 
range between 0.2 Mrad to 900 Mrad. The detector processing and oxygen enrichment were carried out in a common project 
by the Institute of Micro-sensors CiS using n-type high resistivity FZ silicon (3-6 kW cm) with <111> and <100> orientation. 
Different oxygen concentrations were achieved by diffusion at 1150 °C for 24, 48 and 72 hours. This report on bulk damage 
effects is focused on the observed changes in the reverse current, the effective space charge density Neff extracted from C/V 
measurements  and  investigations  using  the  transient  current  technique  (TCT).  A  substantial  improvement  of  radiation 
hardness  concerning  the  development  of  the  macroscopic  properties  was  found  for  detectors  manufactured  on  oxygenated 
material compared to standard material. It will be demonstrated that the change of the effective space charge density as well as 
the increase of the reverse current can be attributed to the creation of two deep acceptor levels and a shallow donor level.

1. Introduction

to  neutrons  no  or  only 

It was demonstrated by the CERN RD48 (ROSE) 
collaboration that a considerable improvement in the 
change  of  the  effective  space  charge  concentration 
can  be  achieved  in  oxygen  enriched  silicon  for 
charged hadron damage and gamma irradiation while 
after  exposure 
little 
suppression was found [1-3]. The beneficial effect of 
oxygen  had  been  discussed  and  modeled  under  the 
assumption that  most  probably  the  V2O  defect  is 
responsible  for  a  main  part  of  the  radiation  induced 
negative space charge and that the formation of V2O 
is  suppressed  in  oxygen  rich  material  [4,  5].  The 
model  predictions  support  also  the  experimental 
observation  that  the  oxygen  effect  is  correlated  with 
the radiation induced formation of point defects. This 
means  that  in  neutron  damage  the  oxygen  effect  is 
suppressed  since  the  damage  is  dominated  by  the 
creation  of  defect  clusters.  On  the  other  hand  a 
maximal  oxygen  effect  is  expected  when  only  point 
defects are created which is the case in  60Co-gamma 
irradiation [2, 6-7]. Here we report on new results of 
bulk damage effects in standard and different oxygen 
enriched  high  resistivity  float  zone  silicon  with 
different  orientation  (<111>  and  <100>)  for  a  wide 
dose range up to 900 Mrad. The experimental results 
for  the  radiation  induced  change  of  the  effective 
doping concentration and the reverse current will be 
discussed  in  the  frame  work  of  recent  microscopic 
studies [8,9].

2. Experimental procedure

The  oxygen  enrichment  and 

the  detector 
processing  was  carried  out  in  a  common  project  by 
the Institute for Microsensors CiS (Erfurt, Germany) 
using  n-type  high  resistivity  float  zone  (FZ)  silicon 
from  Wacker  with  <111>  and  <100>  orientation. 
Different  oxygen  concentrations  were  achieved  by 
diffusion at 1150 0C in N2 atmosphere for 24, 48 and 
72  hours.  The  oxygen  depth  profiles  were  measured 
by  a  special  SIMS-technique  and  compared  with  IR 
the 
absorption  measurements  [10].  In  Table  1 
averaged  concentrations  of  oxygen  and  carbon  are 

23

listed for all samples under investigation. The p+nn+-
detectors have an active area of 0.25 cm2 surrounded 
by a guard ring with a gap of 10µm between the outer 
edge  of  the  central  diode  and  the  inner  rim  of  the 
guard  ring.  The  thickness  of  the  different  samples 
varies between 291µm and 295µm.

The  irradiation  had  been  performed  at  the  high 
intensity  60Co-gamma  source  at  the  Brookhaven 
National Laboratory (BNL/USA) with a dose rate of 
about  600  krad  per  hour.  The  temperature  during 
exposure  was  typically  27  °C.  A  set  of  8  different 
samples was irradiated in consecutive steps of about 
50 Mrad up to 500 Mrad and followed by larger steps 
up to 900 Mrad. Between each step standard I/V and 
C/V  measurements  were
the 
evaluation  of  the  bulk  generation  current  and  the 
change  of  the  depletion  voltage  Vdep needed  to  fully 
extend the space charge region to the depth d of the 
diode. This voltage is related with the effective space 
charge density q0Neff by:

where

I/V  and  C/V  characteristics  were  measured  at  room 
temperature  with  the  guard  ring  of  the  device 
properly  connected  to  ground.  All  presented  reverse 
current data are normalized to 20 °C. 
In  order  to  prove  the  reliability  of  the  extracted 
values  for  the  effective  space  charge  density  current 
pulse  shape  measurements  have  been  performed 
using  the  transient  current  technique  (TCT)  [11,12]. 
For  these  measurements  6  sets  of  8  samples  each 
were exposed to fixed dose values.

The  detectors  manufactured 

from  standard 
material  (CA,CE)  show  the  well  known  effect  of 
space  charge  sign  inversion  (SCSI).  Initially  the 
depletion  voltage  drops  to  a  minimum  value  at  a 

specific  dose  of  about  200  Mrad  before  it 
increasing  dose.  This 
increases  again  with 
behavior  is  usually  interpreted  as  a  result  of  the 
creation  of  deep  acceptor  like  defects  and  donor 
removal (e.g. formation of E-centers (VPs)) which 
leads  to  a  decrease  of  the  initially  positive  space 
charge  followed  by  a  total  compensation  at  a 
certain  dose  and  thereafter  to  an  inversion  of  the 
space charge sign. In contrast to this behavior, for 
all oxygenated devices (CB-CD, CF-CH) a small, 
monotonically  and  non-linear  increase  in  the 
effective  space  charge  density  is  observed.  This 
implies  that  the  effective  space  charge  density 
becomes  more  positive  possibly  caused  by  an 
introduction of donor like defects.

• While  the  leakage  current  increase  for  standard 
material is found to be non-linear, all oxygenated 
detectors  show  a  linear  dose  dependence.  For  an 
accumulated  dose  of  700  Mrad  the  estimated 
increase is about 3 times smaller compared to that 
of the standard devices. But no differences in the 
increase  could  be  observed 
reverse  current 
the  differently  oxygenated  sensors 
between 
themselves.

The  findings  for  the  effective  space  charge  density 
and  in  particular  the  speculation  about  the  inversion 
had  been  proven  by  investigations  of  current  pulse 
shapes recorded for injection of short (» 1 ns) 670 nm 
laser light pulses to the p+- and the n+-contact of the 
diodes.  This  way  time-resolved  electron  and  hole 
transport  can  be  investigated  separately.  As  an 
example  Fig.  2a  presents  current  pulse  shapes  of 
irradiated standard <111> devices for p+-illumination 
and an applied bias voltage of 60 V that was set to be 
well  above  the  full  depletion  voltages  for  this  set  of 
devices irradiated within the dose range of 43 to 284 
Mrad.  Since  the  670  nm  light  is  absorbed  within  a 
few  microns  near  to  the  surface  the  presented  pulse 

shapes are dominated by the transport of electrons in 
the electric field zone of the detector. In this case the 
negative slope of the pulse shape for doses up to 190 
Mrad  reflects  an  electric  field  distribution  of a 
positive  space  charge  and  the  flattening  of  the  slope 
with increasing dose indicates a decrease of the space 
charge  density  as  already  demonstrated 
the 
in 
development 
from  C/V 
measurements. For dose values larger than 200 Mrad 
the  slope  switches  to  positive  values  indicating  the 
inversion  to  a  negative  space  charge.  For  the  same 
dose values and illumination of the p+-electrode Fig. 
2b  shows  current  pulses  recorded  for an oxygenated 
<100> sensor for a constant bias voltage of 80 V.

4. Discussion

the 

effective 

change  of 

According  to  C.  B.  MacEvoy  et  al  [7]  it  is  assumed 
that  the  V2O  defect,  which  was  first  identified  in 
electron  paramagnetic  resonance  (EPR)  studies  in 
heavily electron irradiated silicon [13, 14], plays the 
dominant role with respect to both the change of Neff
and  the  generation  current  increase  induced  by  60Co
gamma radiation. In his paper it is also demonstrated 
that the model predicts a non-linear increase of V2O 
with  dose.  If  this  model  is  correct  we  should  find  a 
correlation  between  the  reverse  current  increase  and 
charge 
the 
concentration.  In  Fig.  3  the  reverse  current  of  a 
standard  <111>  detector  (CA)  is  plotted  as  function 
of the corresponding change of the extracted effective 
space charge concentration defined by D Neff = Neff,0 -
Neff(D).  As  indicated  by  the  solid  line  we  found  an 
excellent  correlation  in  the  range  below  D Neff = 
1.3· 1012 cm-3 which corresponds with the dose range 
up to 300 Mrad. At higher doses the current increases 
more  rapidly  than  the  space  charge  concentration 
which cannot be explained by an introduction of only 
one deep acceptor like V2O. Therefore, we suspect a 
possible  compensation  of  the  negative  space  charge 
due  to  the  introduction  of  shallow  donors  that  are 
positively charged in the depletion region.

obtained  by  C-DLTS- and  TSC-measurements  [8,9]. 
Two close to midgap acceptor levels were discovered 
which are labeled as DA-I and DA-G
. The DA-I level 
is  most  likely  the  V2O  defect  while  the  DA-G
level 
cannot  be  attributed  so  far  to  a  known  defect.  As 
expected  for  the  V2O  the  DA-I  defect  is  strongly 
reduced in oxygen rich diodes and the same behavior 
is also observed for the DA-G defect. Furthermore, in 
oxygen  doped  sensors  an  introduction  of  shallow 
donors (SD) had been detected in TSC-spectra. This 
defect  is  most  probably  the  known  bistable  thermal 
double  donor  TDD2 [15,  16].  For  the  calculation  of 
Neff and the reverse current Irev as a function of dose 
the defect parameters and introduction rates given in 
[8,9] have been used.

only  calculations  for  the  corresponding  detectors

In  Fig.  4a  the  effective  space  charge  concentration 
defined  by  Neff =  ND - NA is  plotted  versus  the 
accumulated  dose.  Here  ND

concentration  of  all  donors  which  are  positively 
charged 
initial 
concentration  of  phosphorus  and  radiation  induced 
shallow  donors,  and  NA is  the  concentration  of 
charged shallow and deep acceptors. It is obvious that 
both deep acceptors DA-I and DA-G
are responsible 
for  the  inversion  of  the  space  charge  sign.  Their 
contributions  to  Neff as  evaluated  from  DLTS- and 
TSC-measurements  are  also  included  in  Fig.  4a.  As 
can  be  seen,  the  dose  dependence  of  the  DA-I 
contribution  is  non-linear  while  that  of  the  DA-G
defect  is  linear.  Taking  only  both  acceptors  into 
account  the  experimental  data  should  follow  a  non-
linear  development  in  the  total  dose  range.  This  is 
obviously  not  observed,  moreover  in  the  high  dose 
range  the  experimental  data  points  favor  a  linear 
dependence. Such development can only be achieved 
if  one  includes  a  small  contribution  of  radiation 
induced  shallow  donors  (SD),  and  a  non-linear 
increase 
the 
in  order 
experimental  data.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  from 
TSC- measurements  on  standard  material  one  can 
only  find  an  indication  for  the  creation  of  shallow 
donors  but  quantitative  estimations  of 
their 
concentrations were not possible [9]. 
Fig.  4b  shows  once  more  the  experimental  data  for 
the  reverse  current  of  the  standard  <111>  detector 
where  the  contributions  of  both  deep  acceptors  are 
included.  Also  in  this  case  the  different  response  of 
the DA-I and the DA-G defect on the dose is clearly 
seen  and  the  agreement  between  the  measured 
reverse  current  values  and  the  evaluated  values  for 
both defects can be stated to be excellent.
Taking  these  results  into  account,  the  following 
parameterization  for  the  dependence  of  Neff as 
function of dose D was used:

Neff(D) = Neff,0 + NSD(D) - NA(D)

concentration before irradiation.
For the calculation of NSD we assume that the shallow 
donors are thermal double donors and, therefore, their 
contribution  to  the  space  charge  has  to  be  counted 

twice since they are double positively charged when 
not  occupied.  Furthermore, 
is 
supposed to be non-linear. This leads to the relation:

the 

NSD(D) = gSD· Dg SD ,

(3)

and  the  contribution  of  both  deep  acceptors  is 
supposed to be:

G

G

NA(D) = gDA-I · Dg DA-I + gDA-

· D (4)

The  g factors  denote  the  effective  introduction  rates 
for  the  defects  SD,  DA-I  and  DA-G which  are 
charged in the depleted volume (see also [9]) and the 
values  describe  the  non-linearity  of  the  defect 
introduction  as  function  of  dose.  A  possible  donor 
removal  has  been  neglected  here 
the 
phosphorus  concentration  is  very  small  and  from 
defect  kinetic  simulations  a  very  small  removal 
constant is expected [17].
The  bulk  generation  current  Irev is  caused  by  both 
deep acceptors only and is parameterized by:

since 

Irev/V = a DA-I · Dg DA-I + a DA-

· D (5)

describes 

Here  V  is  the  volume  of  the  fully  depleted  detector 
and

the  current 
coefficients for both deep acceptor levels. 
According 
the  data 
these  parameterizations 
presented  in  Fig.  4a  and  b  have  been  fitted.  The 
dotted  and  broken  lines  represent  the  fits  to  the 
specific  contributions  of  the  defects  to  the  effective 
space  charge  density  Neff and  the  generation  current 
Irev respectively.  The  full  lines  are  the  result  of  a 
fitting  procedure  which  reproduces  the  experimental 
data for Neff and Irev at the same time. This procedure 
is denoted as "global fit".

4.2. Oxygen enriched material

The  same  fitting  procedures  were  applied  to  the 
experimental data derived for the oxygenated device 
CD  manufactured  from  <111>  material.  The  results 
are  shown  in  Fig.  5.  In  this  case  instead  of  Neff the 
change of the effective doping concentration defined 
by D Neff = Neff (D) - Neff,0 is plotted as function of the 
dose. For this oxygenated material the contribution of 
shallow  donors  could  be  estimated  from  TSC-
measurements  making  use  of  the  bi-stabitity  of  this 
defect  [9].  It  can  be  clearly  seen  that  the  shallow 
donors  overcompensate  the  introduction  of  the  deep 
acceptors  DA-I  and  DA-G
.  On  the  other  hand  the

Fig.  5:  Contributions  of  deep  acceptors  DA-I  and  DA-G
and  a 
shallow  donor  SD  to  the  effective  space  charge  Neff (a)  and  the 
reverse current (b) for oxygenated material as function of dose.

As  already  mentioned  before  the  generation  current 
increases  linearly  with  dose  (see  Fig.  5b)  which  is 
expected from the observed introduction of both deep 
acceptors in Fig. 5a and the increase is much smaller 
compared  to  that  of  standard  material.  But  the 
contribution of both defects to the generation current 
cannot  fully  reproduce  the  measured  values.  As 
pointed  out  in  [9]  possible  reasons  might  be  an 
underestimation  of  the  concentration  for  the  DA-G
defect  and/or  a  contribution  of  other  deep  defect 
centers which possibly could not be detected by TSC-
measurements.
A further point of interest is the question whether any 
dependence  on  the  oxygen  concentration  could  be 
seen in the macroscopic parameters. From Fig. 1b we

can  see  that  the  generation  current  is  obviously  not 
influenced  by  the  different  oxygen  diffusion.  This 
implies that already an oxygenation of 24 hours leads 
to  the  observed  suppression  in  the  creation  of  both 
the  dose 
deep  acceptors.  But  an  analysis  of 
dependence  of  D Neff for  all  oxygenated  detectors 
processed  on  <111>  material  show  a  very  small 
variation  of  the  increase  with  the  oxygen  content 
although  the  fluctuation  of  the  data  points  is  quite 
large.  The  result  is  that  the  introduction  of  shallow 
donors  seems  to  be  influenced  by  the  oxygen 
concentration  of  the  material  but  it  is  so  far  not 
possible  to  decide  whether  the  introduction  rate  gSD

5. Conclusions

irradiation  up 

The  presented  study  on  bulk  damage  effects  after 
60Co  gamma 
to  900  Mrad  had 
substantiated  the  strong  influence  of  oxygen  in 
silicon for the development of more radiation tolerant 
detectors.  For  the  first  time the observed changes of 
the  macroscopic  detector  properties  concerning  the 
effective doping concentration as well as the reverse 
current  can  be  explained  by  radiation  induced  deep 
acceptors  and  the  creation  of  shallow  donors  which 
had been discovered in microscopic studies.

Abstract

Radiation induced  defects  in  silicon  diodes  were  investigated  after  exposure  to  high  doses  of  Co-60  gamma 
irradiation,  using  Deep  Level  Transient  Fourier  Spectroscopy  and  Thermally  Stimulated  Current  methods. The 
main focus was on differences between standard and oxygen enriched material and the impact of the observed 
defect generation on the diode properties. Two close to mid gap trapping levels and a bi-stable donor level have 
been characterized as function of dose. These defects explain the main macroscopic deterioration effects both in 
standard  and  oxygen  enriched  float  zone  diodes.  Radiation  damage  effects  in  silicon  detectors  under  severe 
hadron- and(cid:0)(cid:22)–irradiation are surveyed, focusing on bulk effects. Both macroscopic detector properties (reverse 
current,  depletion  voltage  and  charge  collection)  as  also  the  underlying  microscopic  defect  generation  are 
covered. Basic results are taken from the work done in the CERN-RD48 (ROSE) collaboration updated by results 
of  recent  work.  Preliminary  studies  on  the  use  of  dimerized  float  zone  and  Czochralski  silicon  as  detector 
material  show  possible  benefits.  An  essential  progress  in  the  understanding  of  the  radiation  induced  detector 
deterioration had recently been achieved in gamma irradiation, directly correlating defect analysis data with the 
macroscopic detector performance.

High  resistivity  silicon  particle detectors will be 
used  extensively  in  the  tracking  areas  of  the  CERN 
Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. Since for 
this application the detectors are subject to extremely 
high  hadron  fluences the  radiation  tolerance  of  the

cases  high  resistivity  silicon  (r

chosen to allow for  low operating voltages.

A lot of investigations on hadron induced damage 
and  the  impact  on  detector  performance  had  been 
extensively  studied  by  the  CERN  RD48  (ROSE) 
collaboration [1-6]. It had especially been proven that 
the  deliberate  addition  of  oxygen  ([O]>1017 cm-3)  in 
the  bulk  material  is  beneficial
for  the  radiation 
tolerance  to  charged  particle  and  gamma  exposure. 
The  clearest  benefit  is  gained  in  the  case  of  60Co 
gamma  irradiation. No  change  in  the  initial  doping 
concentration was reported up to a dose of 400 Mrad 
for high resistivity Diffusion Oxygenated Float Zone 
(DOFZ)  silicon while in  the  case  of  Standard  Float 
Zone  (STFZ)  silicon  the  type  inversion  takes  place 
around  250  Mrad  [2].  Many  radiation  induced  point 
defects (VV=/-, VV-/0, CiCs
+/0 etc. ) were 
already well characterized by various methods [5-17]. 
the 
these  defects 
However, 
explain
irradiation-induced  change 
the  macroscopic 
parameters  of  the  detector  performance  (doping 
concentration  and 
the 
improvement  of  the  radiation  tolerance  for  oxygen-
enriched  silicon.  Present  defect  models  attribute  the 
beneficial  oxygen  effect  in  gamma  irradiated  DOFZ 
silicon to a lower probability of V2O formation by an 
enhanced production of VO defects [17-20]. The V2O 
defect was identified in Czochralski (CZ) silicon after 
electron 
by  Electron  Paramagnetic 
Resonance (EPR) [21] and Photo-EPR measurements 
[20]. An activation enthalpy of (0.50– 0.05) eV from 
the conduction band was evaluated for the V2O defect 
in  the  neutral  charge  state  [22].  Recently,  we  have 
reported on a deep level located at 0.545 eV from the 
conduction  band  (Ec)  and  having  electron and  hole 
capture cross sections of s n = (1.7– 0.2)x10-15 cm2 and 
s p =  (9– 1)x10-14 cm2
respectively detected  in  float-
zone silicon after Co60-gamma irradiation with doses

up to 42.5 Mrad [23]. This close to midgap trap (the 
I  level  in  ref.[23]) is  strongly  generated  in  STFZ 
diodes  but  largely  suppressed  in  DOFZ  devices  and 
was  suggested  to  be  related  to  the  V2O  complex  in 
the single charge state. According to our results it can 
explain  about  90%  of the  change  in  the  effective 
doping concentration (Neff) and 50%  of the leakage 
current  (LC)  in  STFZ silicon.  Considering that the I 
level  was  also  detected  in  DOFZ  material  together 
with the still unexplained difference in the measured 
and  calculated 
leakage  current call  for  further 
investigations,  especially  after higher  doses  of 
irradiation.  In  the  following  we  report  on the 
by  Deep  Level  Transient  Fourier 
detection
Spectroscopy 
Thermally 
Stimulated  Current (TSC) [13] methods  of  other 
trapping levels induced by gamma irradiation, which 
together with the mentioned I level can better explain 
the  differences  observed  between  STFZ  and  DOFZ 
diodes.  The  devices investigated  in  this  work  are 
STFZ and DOFZ p+nn+ diodes processed by CiS [25]
on Wacker silicon with high resistivity (4 kW cm) and
exposed  to  Co60- gamma  irradiation  doses  of  10  to 
300  Mrad.  The  average  oxygen  concentration  in  the 
DOFZ  material is  1.2x1017 cm-3 while  in  the  STFZ 
ones it is less than 3x1016 cm--3 [26].

2. Experimental results and discussions

2.1. DLTFS results

investigated  by 

The DLTFS method was applied for doses up to
42.5  Mrad  whereas  the higher  irradiated  samples 
were 
the  TSC method. After 
irradiation  all  dides  were  kept  at  room  temperature 
for  at  least  4  weeks. DLTFS  measurements  were 
performed on both STFZ and DOFZ samples exposed 
to 10 and 42.5 Mrad irradiation doses. For these high 
doses  the  DLTFS  spectra  can  be  well  analyzed  only 
for  temperatures  above  240  K  where  the  most 
abundant  irradiation  induced  point  defects  (e.g.  VO
and  VV)  do not  contribute  anymore  to  the  recorded 
capacitive  transients.  In  addition  to  the  mentioned  I 
level (possibly the V2O-/0 complex) another very deep 
level, labeled as G
, was detected in these samples as 
shown  in Fig.  1a.  An  activation  enthalpy  of  D Hv = 

0.66eV ±1% with respect to the valence band and an 
effective  capture  cross-section  of  s *  =  (5– 3)x10-15
cm2  were  evaluated  for  the  G
defect  from  the 
Arrhenius  plot  (Fig.  1b). The  filling was done using
forward  bias  injection and  therefore s *  does  not 
represent the capture cross section for holes only (s p) 
but  includes also  the  electron  capture  cross  section 
(s n). The s * is given by the following formula [27]:

level,  cn,p(cid:11)7(cid:12)(cid:3)  (cid:3) 1n,p(T)*  (cid:30)th,n,p(T) are  the  respective 
capture  coefficients, NC,V are  the  effective  densities
of states in the conduction band.

Due  to  its  position  in  the  band  gap,  the  G

level 
might  have  a  strong  influence  on  the  detector 
performances  – the  leakage  current  per  unit  volume
(LC) and the effective doping concentration (Neff). In 
order  to  estimate  it  correctly  both  capture  cross 
sections (s n and s p) should be known. Because of the 
high  concentration  of  VV-/0
states  a  direct 
investigation  of  electron emission  from  the  G defect 
is  not  possible.  By  direct  analysis  of  transients  at 
different  temperatures  the 
values were
determined  to  be  9.60x109cm-3,  9.44x109cm-3 and 
9.36x109cm-3
at  273  K,  293  K  and  298  K 
respectively.  Assuming  that  there  is no  temperature 
dependence of s p and s n between 273 K and 298 K
then eq.  2 results  in s p/s n~100.  With  such  a  large 
difference  between  the  two  capture  cross  sections  a 
good approximation is  s p = s * = (5– 3)x10-15 cm2 as 
was evaluated from the Arrhenius plot in fig.1b.

2.2. TSC results

in 

this  case 

The  samples  irradiated  with  higher  doses  (up  to 
284  Mrad)  were  investigated  by  the  TSC  method. 
Also 
the  diodes  stayed  at  room 
temperature  for  more  than  4  weeks  prior  to  the 
measurements.  The  standard  experimental  procedure 
consists  in  cooling  down  from  room  temperature 
(RT)  to  20  K  under  0  bias,  followed  by  forward 
injection (1mA) for 30 sec. and then heating up with 
reverse  bias  (RB)  applied.  The  heating  rate for  the 
TSC experiments was always 0.183 K/s. The filling

of traps was done either by forward biasing or using
hole injection by 670 nm LED illumination from the 
rear side of the reverse biased diode.

In Fig. 2 the recorded TSC spectra for STFZ and 
DOFZ  diodes exposed  to  a  dose  of  284  Mrad are 
presented. In DOFZ diodes the generation of I and G
defects are strongly suppressed, while the VOi center 
exhibits a larger concentration. This may suggest that 
the VOi center plays a major role in the formation of I 
and G defects. In fact, it had been discussed that the 
V2O  complex  results  from  the  reaction  VOi+V (cid:222)
V2O  [17-20].  In  addition,  there  are  some  features 
characteristic  only  for  the  STFZ  or  DOFZ  material 
neither reported so far in the literature nor seen in our 
low dose DLTFS measurements [28].

In the STFZ material a strong peak is observed at 
97 K which proved to act as a trapping level for holes 
(see Fig. 3). In the DOFZ case we see a peak at 50 K
overlapping  a  very  low  temperature  signal  labeled
“BD  tail”.  The  BD  tail  disappears after  keeping  the 
diode  in  the  dark  for  2  days  at  room  temperature 
(RT). Instead, the L(42K) and BD(98K) levels appear 
in the TSC spectrum (see Fig. 4). A level with similar 
like  L(50K)  was  already 
trapping  parameters 
investigated by DLTS and IR- Absorption methods in 
oxygen  rich  Si  and  was  associated  with  the  single 
negative charge state of the interstitial silicon-oxygen 
-/0)  annealing  out  completely  at 
dimer  complex  (IO2
150  0C  [15].  Our  experiments  revealed  that  both
L(50K)  and L(42K)  levels anneal  out  after  1500 C 
heat  treatment  (Fig.  5).  Instead  of  these  two  levels 
another peak labeled L(87K) appears in the spectrum. 
The  L(47K)  peak  is  not  a  result  of  the  annealing.  It 
can already be seen  as a shoulder in the L(50K) peak
prior to annealing.
It  is  worth  to  mention  here  that  no  change  in  the 
magnitude  of  the  leakage  current  or  Neff  was 
measured  after  the  annealing  at  1500 C.  Depending 
on the experimental TSC procedure (cooling after 
exposure  to  day  light  or  after  keeping  the  sample  in 
the dark) a direct correlation between the BD tail and 
BD(98K)  level  was  observed (see  Fig.  5).  It  is  well 
known  that  such  bi-stability  is  characteristic  for  the 
thermal double donors TDD1 and TDD2 (associated 
with small size oxygen clusters) [29-31].

The  donor  activity  of the BD(98K)  level  was 
proven  observing  the  Poole  Frenkel  effect when 
different  RB-values were  applied during  the  TSC 
measurements. The change in the activation enthalpy
was evaluated from Arrhenius plots of the increasing 
part of the peak (see Fig. 6) resulting in a zero field 
activation enthalpy of 0.225 eV for BD(98K) . Thus, 
contrary to the effect of I and G
the BD centers will 
contribute with positive space charge  to Neff. These 
properties  of  the  BD  centers (donor  activity,  bi-
stability, zero  field  activation  energy)  together  with 
their  strong  generation  in  oxygen  enriched  material 
suggest  a  possible  identification  with the  thermal 
double donors TDD2.

The  concentrations of  I,  G
and  BD  centers  in  STFZ 
and DOFZ for different dose values are given in Tab. 
I.  The  errors are  less  than  5%  in  the  case  of  I  level 
and around 20% for the G

level. 
The  experimental  values  of  Neff and  LC  as 
determined  from C-V and I-V measurements as well 
as the calculated ones are given in Fig. 7. There is a 
very  good  agreement  between  measured  and 
calculated  values  of  Neff  for  both  STFZ  and  DOFZ 
diodes. However, the LC cannot be fully described by 
taken only the I and G
level into account (especially 
in the case of DOFZ). Possible reasons for that can be 
that  other  deep  centers  (e.g.  VV-/0)  have  not  been 
included.

The DLTFS method applied to gamma irradiated 
STFZ and DOFZ silicon diodes with doses up to 42 
Mrad  allowed  us  to  characterize  a  new  close  to 
midgap  trapping  level  (G
center)  in  addition  to  the 
already  reported I  defect  (V2O-/0?).The  trapping 
parameters of  the G
level are: an activation enthalpy 
of  D Hv =  0.66eV ±1% from  the  valence  band and  a 
capture  cross-sections  of  s p =  100xs n =  (5– 3)x10-15
cm2. The dependence  of the I  and  G
concentrations
with  increasing  dose  was  investigated  by the TSC 
method.  It  was  shown  that  both  defects  are  largely 
suppressed  in  DOFZ  diodes. In  STFZ  the  I  and  G
level can almost fully explain the change in both the 
leakage  current 
the  effective  doping 
concentration  .  In  the  case  of  DOFZ  diodes the 
negative  space  charge  due  to  I  and  G
centers  is 
overcompensated  by  the  positive  charge  introduced 
by some bi-stable donors (TDD2 ?) leading even  to a 
slight increase of the effective donor concentration.

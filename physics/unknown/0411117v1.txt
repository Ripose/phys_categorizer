1. Introduction 
 
Particle nucleation in processing plasmas is an important issue that was studied both 
 
experimentally and theoretically.  A better understanding of particle nucleation may help us to 
understand  the  basic  problems  of  the  involved  plasma  chemistry.    On  the  other  hand  it  is 
interesting to be able to control the production of the particles. 
 
One  of  the  observed  phenomena  is  a  delay  of  particle  nucleation  in  argon-silane 
plasmas  due  to  an  increase  of  the  gas  temperature  [1,  2].    It  is  one  of  various  “critical 
phenomena”  that  has  been  recognized  in  the  process  of  dust  formation.    It  was  recently 
proposed [3] that the temperature dependence of the Brownian diffusion is the most important 
effect for the nucleation delay in argon-silane plasmas. 
 
In  our  work  we  focused  on  the  study  of  powder  formation  in  C2H2/Ar  plasmas 
according  to  the  fact  that  acetylene  as  monomer  plays  an  important  role  in  rapid  powder 
formation.  In this scope we used a combination of FTIR and mass spectroscopy, which are 
the mostly used experimental techniques for the diagnostics of powder formation. To test the 
proposed mechanism for particle nucleation delay we measured the particle nucleation under 
different  plasma  conditions:  firstly  we  increased  the  gas  temperature  and  secondly  we 
changed the background gas from argon to helium. 
 
2. Experiment 
 
 
Our  experimental  set-up  consists  of  a  parallel-plane  electrode  system,  30  cm  in 
diameter, forming a 8 cm wide gap.  The electrodes are symmetrically capacitively coupled 
on a 13.6 MHz power supply witch is used for standard industry applications.  The electrode 
system is confined in a stainless-steel vacuum vessel, supplied with several observation ports 
which  are  used  for:  Fourier  –  Transformed  Infrared  absorption  (FTIR),  mass  spectroscopy, 
plasma emission spectroscopy, Langmuir probe measurements, and dust collection.  An argon 
acetylene or argon/ helium gas mixture in the ratio of 8 sccm (standard cubic centimetre pro 
minute)  to  0.5  sccm  was  continuously  supplied  to  the  discharge  chamber  by  means  of  gas 
flow controller.  More details of our experimental set-up and procedure can be found in our 
previous papers [4, 5]. 
 
3. Results 
 

During  the  operation of the plasma we observed a periodically repeating growth and 
disappearance  of  the  dust  particles  with  a  time  period  of  approximately  25  min.    This 
periodical behaviour was detected by means of laser and/or IR extinction measurements.  We 
explained this effect by means of a simple model [4]: after the nucleation, the dust particles 
continue to grow by accretion.  The balance of the different forces acting on the particles (ion 
drag,  electrostatic,  gravitational,  neutral  drag,  and  thermophoresis)  keep  the  dust  levitating 
inside the plasma (for our experimental conditions the dust is not only present in the vicinity 
of  the  plasma  sheets  but  also  in  the  plasma  bulk).    The  diffusion  to  the  walls/electrodes  is 
constricted  through  the  plasma  potential.    According  to  the  different  dependence  upon  the 
particle radius, the balance of these forces is broken after the dust has reached a certain radius.  
The dust then disappears from the plasma and the new growth process starts.  Before the dust 
disappears we observed the formation of s void in the middle between the electrodes. 

3.1. Temperature dependence 
 
 
In  our  experiment  we  were  able  to  increase  the  gas  temperature  by  heating  the 
stainless-steel vacuum vessel.  We worked at two different temperatures: at room temperature  
(27˚C ) and at a temperature of 80˚C. 
 
Fig. 1 shows the temporal development of the IR signal obtained from measured FTIR 
spectra [4] for two different gas temperatures T  = 27˚C and T  = 80˚C in a argon/acetylene 
discharge.    It  can  be  seen  that  in  the  case  of  the  elevated  gas  temperature  the  particle 
nucleation/coagulation  starts  several  minutes  later  for the first cycle. The time between two 
consecutive cycles is also in the same order of magnitude larger.

3.2 The influence of the background gas 
 
To  test  the  influence  of  the  background  gas  on  the  particle  nucleation  delay  we 
 
changed  from  the  argon/acetylene  to  the  argon/helium  mixture,  keeping  the  gas  flow  rates 
identical.  The results are presented on Fig. 2.  The time for starting the first growth cycle in 
the  He/C2H2  mixture  is  drastically  increased  whereas  the  period  time  of  the  observed 
oscillation is decreased.  The changing of the oscillation amplitude of the IR signal in the case 
of the He/C2H2 discharge can be attributed to a changing of the  plasma conditions in the first 
few cycles.  The impurities in the plasma chamber (oxygen and water) can change the plasma 
conditions and the capability of the plasma to carry larger dust particles.  After a few cycles, 
the  chamber  walls  and  electrodes  are  cleaned  or  covered  with  a  hydrocarbon  film,  thus 
eliminating the main source of impurities [4].  After this time the oscillation amplitude stays 
almost constant. 
 
4. Discussion 
 
 
In  their  recent  paper  Bhandakhar,  Kortshagen  and  Grishick  used  a  quasi-one-
dimensional  model  to  simulate  particle  generation  in  argon-silane  plasma  [3].    They 
performed  a  comparative  study  of  all  explanations  for  nucleation  delay  proposed:  the 
temperature dependence of the de-excitation of vibration ally excited species, the temperature 
dependence  of  the  electron  attachment  rate,  gas  density  effects,  and  the  temperature 
dependence  of  the  Brownian  diffusion  coefficient.    Only  the  latter  effect  could,  at  least 
quantitatively explain the observed delay in nucleation. 

Our experimental results in different polymerisation systems support their conclusion 
 
because of different processes leading to the formation of the dust.  The increase of the gas 
temperature leads to increase of nucleation delay, according to Fig. 2.  In the same manner, by 
switching  from  argon  to  helium  as  the  background  gas,  we  increased  Brownian  diffusion 
coefficient which governs the nucleation delay (see equation 4 in [3]). 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
 
In  this  paper  we  analysed  the  time  delay  for  onset  of  nucleation  in  hydrocarbon 
plasma.  The two different conditions were tested, which should be critical for the observed 
nucleation  delay:  gas  temperature  increase  and  background  gas  effect.    In  both  cases  the 
increase of the delay time was observed.  This is in accordance with the results of the quasi-
one –dimensional model [3] tested on silane plasma.

ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
 
The value of the cosmological constant arising from a crystalline model for vacuum cosmic 

space with lattice parameter of the order of the neutron radius [1] has been calculated.  The 

model allows to solve, in an easy way, the problem of the cosmological constant giving the 

right  order  of  magnitude,  which  corresponds  very  well  with  the  mean  value  of  matter 
density in the universe.  The obtained value is about 10-48 Km-2.    Diffraction experiments 

with non-thermal neutron beam in cosmic space are proposed to search for the possibility of 

crystalline structure of vacuum space and to measure the lattice parameter.

INTRODUCTION 

A  review  of  recent  cosmological  observations  suggests  a  universe  that  is  lightweight 

(matter density about one third of the critical value), is spatially flat at big scale and in an 

unexpected way the radial distance between galaxies is increasing at an accelerating rate [1, 

The acceleration of the expansion of the radial distance between galaxies which forms the 

universe  requires  the  existence  of  energy  to  overcome  the  gravitational  self-attraction  of 

matter.    The  cosmological  constant  also  called  lambda  (written  as

Λorλ

)  is  a  long  time 

candidate  for  serving  as  this  energy  reservoir.    In  1967,  Zel’dovich  [3]  showed  that  the 

energy  density  of  the  vacuum  should  act  precisely  as  the  energy  associated  with  the 

cosmological  constant.    Lately,  theorists  have  been  dusting  its  off  again  and  speculating 

about sources for the energy based on the fleeting particles that wink in and out of existence 

in vacuum space, according to quantum relativistic mechanics.  But calculations based on 

that idea lead to lambda’s that are 120 orders of magnitude larger than the energy contained 

in all the matter in the universe [4-8].  And, this last result is based on speculation, of many 

theorists, that there is a cutoff in the maximum frequency of the oscillation vacuum modes 
which  corresponds  to  the  Planck’s  distance  of  about  10-33  cm  [9].      So  theorists  are 

exploring  different  alternatives.    For  instance,  some  researchers  consider  that  the 

cosmological  constant  arises  from  different  possibilities  such  as:    Local  voids  or 

nonhomogeneities in the universe expansion [10, 11], a true Casmir effect on a  scalar field 

filling  the  universe  [12],  or  give  alternative  scenarios  to  a  pure  cosmological  constant 

provided by a classical scalar field known as quintessence [2, 13-17]; also the self-tuning 

brane scenario like an attempt to solve the cosmological constant problem have been used 

[18], and some people use the anthropic principle trying to explain the small value of the 

cosmological constant [19, 29].  As far as we know there are no experimental data which 

give  support  in  a  conclusive  way,  to  any  of  the  previous  models  for  the  cosmological 

constant  problem.    In  other  words,  this  problem  and  also  its  associated  one  of  the 

acceleration of the universe expansion remain still unsolved.

The quantum theory of the vacuum considers it as a three dimensional harmonic oscillator.  

Quantum field theory is notorious for its divergences.  The most fundamental one concerns 

the energy density of the vacuum [9].  In a companion paper, the problem of gravitational 

stability  of  an  infinite,  three-dimensional,  vacuum  cosmic  space  with  crystalline  structure 

has  been  studied  [21].    Such  model  assigns  physical  reality  to  the  three  dimensional 

harmonic oscillator scheme used in quantum theory to describe the vacuum.  In this scheme 

the lattice parameter of the vacuum cosmic crystalline space is of the order of the neutron 

The main purpose of this work is to evaluate the cosmological constant arising from such 

crystalline vacuum cosmic space, and make a comparison with the available experimental

data. 

2.  THEORY 

According to our theoretical scheme [21, 22] we have the following situation.  The cut off 
maximum frequency used in standard quantum theories implies 1020 neutron masses inside 
a volume 1060 time lower than the neutron volume, which gives 1080 neutron density.  In 

our  scheme,  which  considers  that  the  vacuum  cosmological  space  has  a  crystalline 

character with a lattice parameter equal to the nuclear radius of a neutron, the problem of 
10120 becomes a problem of 1040 time the magnitude of the observational limits; but this of 

course  is  the  expected  magnitude  for  the  case  of  a  crystalline  lattice  with  such  lattice 

parameter.  And it is clear that the energy density of the vacuum associated to a crystalline 

lattice is not a thermodynamical free energy but a linked one, which is another way to say 

that  inside  the  actual  universe  volume,  VOU,  a  crystalline  structure  with  minimum  free 

energy  exists;  and  such  vacuum  structure  has  minimum  configurational  entropy.      The 

quantum - gravitational interaction between the lattice entities which yield the gravitational 

stability  of  such  crystalline  space  has  been  described  in  a  global  way  by  the  analysis  of 

quantum fluctuations on the energy per unit volume of the crystalline vacuum space, ECV, 
[21].  The global value of such fluctuations is about 10-40 ECV. Therefore in our scheme the 

5

impossible  problem  to  be  solved,  namely  the  cosmological  constant  problem  becomes  a 

trivial one. 

In a mathematical way, we have the following, an expression which relates both the time 

derivatives of the cosmological constant 

 and the volumetric density of vacuum energy

character of cosmic space at large scale as actually observed.    

In this theoretical scheme, it is not possible to obtain another value for λqf than the one with 

the right one order of magnitude, and the problem of the cosmological constant becomes a 

trivial one. Also, it follows immediately that the total energy density of the vacuum space 

UTV  can  be  locally  determined  from  diffraction  experiments  by  using  a  neutron  beam  in 

conditions of very high vacuum levels.  In principle the diffraction experiments are easy to 

imagine,  a  very  well  collimated  non  -  thermal  neutron  beam  is  ejected  into  the  cosmic 

vacuum,  some  of  such  neutrons  will  be  diffracted  by  the  vacuum  crystalline  structure 

exhibiting a change on linear momentum due to their interaction with the vacuum lattice to 

its interaction with the vacuum lattice entities.   In principle, careful diffraction experiments 

should allow us also to obtain information about the long - range gravitational stresses on 

the crystalline structure of the neighboring cosmic space.

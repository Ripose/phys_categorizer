Abstract

n-Lie algebra structures on smooth function algebras given by means

of multi-diﬀerential operators, are studied.

Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the sum and the wedge product
of two n-Poisson sructures to be again a multi-Poisson are found. It is
proven that the canonical n-vector on the dual of an n-Lie algebra g is
n-Poisson iﬀ dim g ≤ n + 1.

The problem of compatibility of two n-Lie algebra structures is ana-
lyzed and the compatibility relations connecting hereditary structures of
a given n-Lie algebra are obtained. (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras are
classiﬁed and their ”elementary particle-like” structure is discovered.

Some simple applications to dynamics are discussed.

Keywords: n-Lie algebra, n-Poisson (Nambu) bracket, n-Poisson (Nambu) manifold, n-

Introduction

The concept of n-Poisson structure (Nambu-Poisson manifold in terminology
by Takhtajan) is a particular case of that of n-Lie algebra. To our knowledge
the latter was introduced for the ﬁst time by V.T.Filippov [7] in 1985 who
gave ﬁrst examples, developed ﬁrst structural concepts, like simplicity, in this
context and classiﬁed n-Lie algebras of dimensions 2n + 1 which is parallel to
the Bianchi classiﬁcation of 3-dimensional Lie algebras. Filippov deﬁnes an n-
Lie algebra structure to be an n-ary multi-linear and anti-symmetric operation
which satisﬁes the n-ary Jacobi identity :

[[u1, ..., un], v1, ..., vn−1]] = [[u1, v1, ..., vn−1], u2, ..., un]

+ [u1, [u2, v1, ..., vn−1], u3, ..., un]+

· · ·

+ [u1, ..., un−1, [un, v1, ..., vn−1]]

(1)

Such an operation, realized on the smooth function algebra of a manifold
and additionally assumed to be an n-derivation, is an n-Poisson structure. This
general concept, however, was not introduced neither by Filippov, nor, to our
knowledge, by other mathematicians that time. It was done much later in 1994
by L.Takhtajan [23] in order to formalize mathematically the n-ary generaliza-
tion of Hamiltonian mechanics proposed by Y.Nambu [20] in 1973. Apparently
Nambu was motivated by some problems of quark dynamics and the n-bracket
operation he considered was :

{f1, ..., fn} = detk

∂fi
∂xj

k

(2)

But Nambu himself as well as his followers do not mention that n-bracket (2)
satisﬁes the n-Jacobi identity (1). On the other hand, Filippov reports (2) in his
paper among other examples of n-Lie algebras. It seems that Filippov’s work
remained unnoticed by physicists. For instance, Takhtajan refers in [23] to a
private communication by Flato and Fronsdal of 1992 who observed that the
Nambu canonical bracket (2) satisﬁes the fundamental identity (1).

In this paper we study local n-Lie algebras, i.e. n-Lie algebra structures
on smooth function algebras of smooth manifolds which are given by means of
multi-diﬀerential operators. It follows from a theorem by Kirillov that these
structure multi-diﬀerential operators are of ﬁrst order. We call n-Jacobi a local
n-Lie algebra structure on a manifold. In the case when the structure multi-
diﬀerential operator is a multi-derivation one gets an n-Poisson structure. So,
n-Poisson manifolds form a subclass of n-Jacobian ones. The main mathematical
result of the paper is a full local description of n-Jacobi and, in particular, of
n-Poisson manifolds. This is an n-ary analogue of the Darboux lemma.
In
what concerns n-Poisson manifolds the same result was also recently obtained

3

by Alexeevsky and Guha [1]. Our approach is, however, quite diﬀerent and,
maybe, better reveals why n-Poisson and n-Jacobi structures reduce essentially
to the functional determinants (2) (theorems 1 and 2).

An important consequence of the n-Darboux lemma is that the cartesian
product of two n-Jacobi, or two n-Poisson manifolds does not produce manifold
of the same type if n > 2. Possibly this fact may explain the remarkable insep-
arability of quarks. This possibility suggests to investigate better the relevance
of local n-Lie algebra structures for quark dynamics. The structure of (n + 1)-
dimensional n-Lie algebras which is described in sect. 6 seems to be in favor of
such idea.

It was not our unique goal in this paper to describe local structure of local
n-Lie algebras. First, we tried to be systematic in what concerns the relevant
basic formulae and constructions. Second, possible applications of the developed
theory to integrable systems and related problems of dynamics are illustrated
on some examples of current interest.

More precisely, the content of the paper is as follows.
In sect. 2 the necessary generalities concerning n-Lie algebras and their
derivations are reported. A new point discussed there is the concept of compati-
bility of two n-Lie structures deﬁned on the same vector space. Two compatible
structures can be combined to get a third one. This is why this concept seems
to be of a crucial importance even for the theory of usual, i.e. 2-Lie, algebras.
Fixing a number of arguments in an n-Lie bracket one gets new multi-linear Lie
algebras of lower multiplicities, called hereditary. We deduce the compatibility
relations tacking together hereditary structures of a given n-Lie algebra.

Generalities on n-Poisson manifolds are collected in sect. 3. There we in-
troduce and discuss such basic notions related to an n-Poisson manifold as the
Casimir algebra, Casimir map and Hamiltonian foliation. It is shown that an
n-Poisson structures allow for multiplication by smooth functions if n ≥ 3.

The main structure result regarding n-Poisson structures (theorem 1) is
proved in sect. 4. It tells that the structure n-vector of an n-Poisson struc-
ture is of rank n (decomposable) if n > 2. This leads directly to the n-Darboux
lemma: Given an n-Poisson structure, n > 2, on a manifold M there exists
a local chart x1, ..., xm, m = dimM ≥ n, on M such that the corresponding
n-Poisson bracket is given by (2). Two consequences of this result are worth
mentioning. First,the n-bracket deﬁned naturally on the dual of an n-Lie alge-
bra V is not generally an n-Poisson structure if n > 2. This is in sharp contrast
with usual, i.e. n = 2, Lie algebras. However, we show that it is still so for
n-dimensional and (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras. By this and some other
reasons it is naturally to conjecture that n-Lie algebras with n > 2 are essen-
tially n-dimensional and (n + 1)-dimensional ones. Finally, in this section we
deduce necessary and suﬃcient conditions in order the wedge product of two
multi-Poisson structures be again a Poisson one.

The n-Darboux lemma for general n-Jacobi manifolds with n > 2 is proved
in sect. 5, theorem 2 and corollary 15. The key idea in doing that is to split

4

a ﬁrst order multi-diﬀerential operator into two parts similarly to the canon-
ical representation of a scalar ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator as the sum of a
derivation and a function. An n-ary analogue of the well-known Bianchi clas-
siﬁcation of 3-dimensional Lie is given in sect. 6. An exhaustive description of
(n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras was already done by Filippov [7] by a direct
algebraic approach. Our approach is absolutely diﬀerent and based on the use
of the natural n-Poisson structure on the dual of an (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie
algebra. It allows to get the classiﬁcation in a very simple and transparent way
and, what is more important, to discover what we would like to call a elemen-
tary particle-like structure of (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras. More exactly,
we shows that any such algebra is a speciﬁc linear combination of two simplest
n-Lie algebra types realized in a mutually compatible (in the sense of sect. 2)
way. A number similar to the coupling constant appears in this context. In
this section we describe also derivations of (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras
and realize the Witt (or sl(2, R)-Kac-Moody) algebra as a 2-Lie subalgebra of
the canonical 3-algebra structure on R3. In the concluding sect. 7 we exhibit
on concrete examples some simple applications of n-ary structures to dynamics.
First, we use the Kepler dynamics to show how the constants of motion can be
put in relation with multi-Poisson structures. Second, alternative Poisson real-
izations of a spinning particle dynamics Γ are given by using ternary structures
preserved by Γ. In a separate paper applications to dynamics of the developed
formalism will be discussed more systematically.

The multi-generalization of the concept of (local) Lie algebra studied in
this paper is not, in fact, unique and there are other natural alternatives (see
[19, 15, 9, 27]). All these generalizations are mutually interrelated and open
very promising perspectives for particle and ﬁeld dynamics.

In this article we follow Filippov in what concerns the terminology and use
n-Lie algebra instead of Takhtajian’s Nambu-Lie gebras. The reason is that
arabic al-gebre became ethymologically indivisible in the current mathematical
language , like ring, group, etc. So, it would be hardly convenient to use n-gebra
together with indisputable n-ring.

2 n-Lie algebras

We start with some basic deﬁnitions.

Deﬁnition 1 An n-Lie algebra structure on a vector space V (over a ﬁeld K)
is a multi-linear mapping of V × · · · × V
to V such that for any ui, vj ∈ V, the

n-Jacobi identity (1) holds.

|

n times
{z

}

Remark 1 It is convenient to treat the ground ﬁeld K as the unique 0-Lie
algebra and a linear space supplied with a linear operator as an 1-Lie algebra.

5

If an n-Lie algebra is ﬁxed in the current context we refer to the underlying
vector space V as the n-Lie algebra in question (as it is common for the usual
Lie algebras). However, sometimes we need consider two or more n-Lie algebras
structures on the same vector space. In such a situation we use P (u1, ..., un)
instead of [u1, ..., un]. This notation appeals directly to the n-Lie algebra in
question and is more ﬂexible than the use of alternative bracket graphics.

Example 1 [7] Let V be an (n + 1)-dimensional vector space over R supplied
with an orientation and a scalar product (· , ·).

The n-vector product [v1, . . . , vn] of v1, . . . , vn ∈ V is deﬁned uniquely by

requirements:

1. [v1, . . . , vn] is ortogonal to all vi’s;

2. |[v1, . . . , vn]| = detk(vi, vj )k

1
2 ;

3. the ordered system v1, . . . , vn, [v1, . . . , vn] conforms the orientation of V.

Let P and Q be n-Lie algebra structures on V and W, respectively. Then their
direct product R = P ⊕ Q deﬁned as

R((v1, w1), . . . , (vn, wn)) = (P (v1, . . . , vn), Q(w1, . . . , wn))

with vi ∈ V, wi ∈ W is an n-Lie algebra structure on V ⊕ W.

A central notion in the theory of n-Lie algebras is that of derivation [7].

Deﬁnition 2 A linear map D : V → V is said to be a derivation of the n-Lie
algebra V if for any u1, ..., un ∈ V

D[u1, ..., un] = X
i=1

[u1, ..., Dui, ..., un]

(3)

Fixing arbitrary elements u1, ..., un−1 ∈ V one gets a map v → [u1, ...un−1, v]
which is a derivation of V as it follows from the Jacobi identity (1). Such a
derivation is called pure inner associated with u1, ..., un−1. It will be denoted
by adu1,...,un−1 or Pu1,...,un−1 for the n-Lie algebra structure P in question.
Linear combinations of pure inner derivations will be called inner derivations
(of P ). Note that the concepts of inner and pure inner coincide for n = 2 and
that Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are inner derivations of the background Poisson
structure. Following the standard terminology we, sometimes, shall call outer,
derivations of V which are not inner just to stress the instance of it.

Proposition 1 Derivations of an n-Lie algebra form a Lie algebra with respect
to the standard commutation operation and inner derivations constitute an ideal
of it.

6

Proof. Let D1, D2 be derivations of the bracket [·, . . . , ·]. Then, obviously,

D1(D2([u1, ..., un])) = X
i<j
+[..., D2ui, ..., D1uj, ...]) + X
i

([..., D1ui, ..., D2uj, ...]

[u1, ..., D1D2ui, ..., un]

(4)

Therefore,

[D1, D2]([u1, ..., un]) = X
i

[u1, ..., [D1, D2]ui, ..., un]

(5)

First assertion in the proposition is so proven. The second assertion follows by
observing that for a derivation D:

[D, adu1,...un−1]u = D([u1, ..., un−1, u]) − [u1, ..., un−1, Du]

= X
i≤n−1

[u1, ..., Dui, ...un−1, u]

So, in virtue of (5) one has

[D, adu1,...un−1]([v1, ..., vn]) = X
i
[v1, . . . , [u1, ..., Dus, ...un−1, vi], . . . , vn])

[v1, ..., [D, adu1,...,un−1]vi, ..., vn]

In other words,

[D, adu1,...un−1] = X

Note also the following relation in the algebra of inner derivations of P which
is due to skew-commutativity of the left hand side commutator in (9):
Pi Pu1,...,[v1,...vn−1,ui],...,un−1 + Pi Pv1,...,[u1,...,un−1,vi],...,vn−1 = 0
A description of the derivation algebra of an n + 1-dimensional n-Lie algebra
is given in proposition 25, see also [7]. Various outer derivations of an ”atomic”
4-dimensional 3-lie algebra are presented in example 11.

While the above results are just straightforward generalizations of known
elementary facts of the standard Lie algebra theory the following simple ob-
servation (due to Filippov) is a very important new peculiarity of n-ary Lie
algebras with n > 2.

Proposition 2 Let P be an n-Lie algebra structure on V. Then for any u1, ..., uk ∈
V, k ≤ n, Pu1,...,uk is an (n − k)-Lie algebra structure on V.

Proof. It is suﬃcient, obviously, to prove this result for k = 1 only. But in this
case one can see easily that the Jacobi identity for Pu is obtained from that of
P just by putting in it un = un−1 = u. ⊲

Example 2 If P is the n-vector product structure of example 1, then the (n−k)-
Lie algebra structure Pu1,...,uk on V is the direct product of the trivial structure
on S = Span{u1, . . . , uk} and the (n − k)-vector product structure on S⊥ with
respect to the scalar product

(·, ·)′ = λ(·, ·)|S⊥

,

λ = (volk(u1, . . . , uk))

1
n−k ,

on S⊥.

Multi-Lie structures Pu1,...,uk obtained in this way from P will be called hered-
itary (with respect to P ) of order k. The fact that these structures belong to
the same family implies mutual compatibility of them, an important concept we
are going to discuss.

With this purpose we need ﬁrst the following analogue of the Lie derivation
operator. Let Q : V × ... × V → V be a k-linear mapping and ∂ : V → V be a
linear operator. The ∂-derivative ∂(Q) of Q is also a k-linear map deﬁned as

[∂(Q)](u1, ..., uk) = ∂(Q(u1, ..., uk)) − Pi Q(u1, ..., ∂ui, ..., uk)
Note that the Jacobi identity (1) is equivalent to Pu1,...,uk(P ) = 0 for any

u1, ..., uk ∈ V.

Example 3 If k = 1, i.e. Q is a linear operator on V, then ∂(Q) = [∂, Q].

Sometimes it is more convenient to use L∂ instead of ∂ for the ∂-derivative. An
instance of it is the formula

[L∂, ıu] = ı∂(u)

where ıu for u ∈ V denotes the insertion operator, i.e.

ıu(Q)(u1, ..., uk−1) = Q(u, u1, ..., uk−1)

The proof of (10) is trivial.

(10)

(11)

8

Deﬁnition 3 Two n-Lie algebra structures on V are said compatible if for any
u1, ..., un−1 ∈ V.

Pu1,...,un−1(Q) + Qu1,...,un−1(P ) = 0

(12)

Remark 2 If V = C∞(M ), n = 2 and P and Q are two Poisson structures
on M , then they are compatible in the well-known sense of Magri [17](see also
[5, 6, 14]) iﬀ they are compatible in the sense of deﬁnition 3. It is not diﬃcult
to see that in such a situation condition (12) is identical to vanishing of the
Schouten bracket of P and Q.

Example 4 For n = 1 the compatibility condition is empty. In fact, in this
case P and Q are just linear operators and

P (Q) + Q(P ) = [P, Q] + [Q, P ] = 0

.

The following proposition gives a possible interpretation of the notion of com-
patibility.

Proposition 3 Let P and Q be n-Lie structures on V. If a, b ∈ K, ab 6= 0,
then aP + bQ is an n-Lie algebra structure iﬀ P and Q are compatible.

Proof. The following identity is due to linearity of the Lie derivative expression
I(R) with respect to both I and R:

(aP + bQ)u1,...,un−1(aP + bQ) = a2Pu1,...,un−1(P ) + abPu1,...,un−1(Q)
+ abQu1,...,un−1(P ) + b2Qu1,...,un−1(Q)

It remains now to apply interpretation (10) of the Jacobi identity.⊲

Example 5 Let A be an associative algebra. For a given M ∈ A deﬁne a
skew-symmetric bracket [· , ·]M on A by putting

[A, B]M = AM B − BM A,

A, B ∈ A.

(13)

It is easy to see that this, in fact, is a Lie algebra structure on A. Moreover,
for any M, N ∈ A structures [· , ·]M and [· , ·]N are compatible. This follows
from the fact that

[· , ·]M + [· , ·]N = [· , ·]M+N

Corollary 1 Any two ﬁrst order hereditary structures Pu and Pv of an n-Lie
algebra P are compatible.

9

Proof. In fact, according to proposition 2, Pu + Pv = Pu+v is an (n − 1)-algebra
structure. ⊲

On the contrary, hereditary structures of order greater than 1 are not, in

general, mutually compatible . It can be seen as follows.

Denote by Comp(P, Q; u1, ..., un−1) the left hand side of the compatibility

condition (12). Then a direct computation shows that

Comp(Pu,v, Pw,z; u1, .., un−3) = PP (u,v,u1,..,un−3,w),z + Pw,P (u,v,u1,..,un−3,z)
+ PP (w,z,u1,..,un−3,u),v + Pu,P (w,z,u1,..,un−3,v)

In particular, for u1 = u we have

Comp(Pu,v, Pw,z; u, u2, ..., un−3) = Pu,P (w,z,u,u2...,un−3,v)

= QQ(w,z,u2...,un−3,v)

with Q = Pu. Now one can see from an example that QQ(w,z,u2...,un−3,v) is
generically diﬀerent from zero. For instance, if P is the n-vector product algebra,
then Q = Pu is isomorphic to the direct sum of the (n−1)-vector product algebra
and the trivial 1-dimensional one. Then QQ(w,z,u2...,un−3,v) = 0 for linearly
independent w, z, u2..., un−3, v belonging to the ﬁrst direct summand. However,
second order hereditary structures are subjected to another kind of relations
deriving from that of compatibility. To describe them it will be convenient to
introduce a symmetric bilinear function Comp(P, Q) deﬁned by:

Comp(P, Q)(u1, ..., un−1) = Comp(P, Q; u1, ..., un−1)

(14)

By deﬁnition Comp(P, Q) is an (n − 1)-linear skew-symmetric function on V
with values in the space of n-linear skew-symmetric functions on V. By this
reason we have, in particular,

Comp(Pu+w,v, Pu+w,z) = Comp(Pu,v, Pu,z) + Comp(Pu,v, Pw,z)
+ Comp(Pw,v, Pu,z) + Comp(Pw,v, Pw,z)

Note now that two second order hereditary structures of the form Px,y, Px,z
are compatible because they can be regarded as ﬁrst order hereditary structures
of the (n − 1)-Lie algebra Px. By this reason the above equality reduces to

Comp(Pu,v, Pw,z) + Comp(Pu,z, Pw,v) = 0

(15)

Identity (15) binding second order secondary structures tells that the compati-
bility condition between Pu,v and Pw,z depends rather on bi-vectors u ∧ v and
w ∧ z than on vectors u, v and w, z representing them, correspondingly.

Similar relations binding together k-th order hereditary structures can be
found by generalizing properly the above reasoning. With this purpose we need
to develop a suitable notation associated with a ﬁxed n-Lie algebra structure P
on V. Let v1, ..., vk, w1, ..., wk ∈ V,

i = 1, ..., k.

10

Let us deﬁne the symbol < v1, ..., vk|w1, ..., wk > by:

< v1, .., vk|w1, .., wk > (u1, .., un−k−1)
= Comp(Pv1,..,vk , Pw1,..,wk; u1, .., un−k−1)

So, < v1, ..., vk|w1, ..., wk > is a skew-symmetric (n − k − 1)-linear function
on V with values in the space of (n − k)-linear skew-symmetric functions on V.
Moreover, it is symmetric with respect v and w, i.e.

< v1, ..., vk|w1, ..., wk >=< w1, ..., wk|v1, ..., vk >

(16)

If I =
and skew-symmetric with respect to variables vi’s as well as wi’s.
(i1, ..., ip) is a sequence of integers such that i1 < ... < ip, then (v, w)I stands
for the sequence of n elements of V such that its s-th term is vs if s ∈ I and
ws otherwise. A similar meaning has the symbol (w, v)I . For example, if k = 5
(w, v)I = (w1, v2, w3, v4, v5).
and I = (1, 3), then (v, w)I = (v1, w2, v3, w4, w5),
Deﬁne now the following quadratic function :

C(v1, ..., vk|w1, ..., wk) = X
I,i1=1

< (v, w)I |(w, v)I >

(17)

Proposition 4 For any v1, ..., vk, w1, ..., wk ∈ V, n ≥ k, it holds

C(v1, ..., vk|w1, ..., wk) = 0

(18)

Equality (18) is called the k-th order compatibility condition.

Remark 3 Corollary 1 is identical to (18) for k = 1 while formula (15) to (18)
for k = 2.

Proof. It goes by induction. Corollary 1 allows to start it. Supposing then the
validity of (18) for k for all multi-Lie algebras, we observe that

C(x1, ..., xk, u|y1, ..., yk, u) = 0

(19)

(for any x1, ..., xk, y1, ..., yk, u ∈ V. In fact,this condition coincides with the k-th
order compatibility condition for (n − 1)-Lie algebra Pu. In particular,

C(v1, ..., vk, vk+1 + wk+1|w1, ..., wk, vk+1 + wk+1) = 0

(20)

On the other hand, it is easily seen that

C(v1, .., vk, vk+1 + wk+1|w1, .., wk, vk+1 + wk+1) =
PI,i1=1 < (v, w)I , vk+1 + wk+1|(w, v)I , vk+1 + wk+1 >

11

where (v, w)I has the same meaning as in (17) and ((v, w)I , x) denotes the
sequence that becomes (v, w)I once last term x is deleted. Multi-linearity of
the symbol < ...|... > allows to develop last expression as the sum of terms
of the form < (v, w)I , x|(w, v)I , y > with x, y taking independently the values
vk+1, wk+1 . After that it remains to observe that the k-th order compatibility
condition for the algebra Px gives

< (v, w)I , x|(w, v)I , x >= 0

(21)

and

⊲

C(v1, ..., vk+1|w1, ..., wk+1) = X

+ X
I,i1=1

< (v, w)I , vk+1|(w, v)I , wk+1 >

< (v, w)I , wk+1|(w, v)I , vk+1 >

Example 6 The explicit form of the third compatibility condition is

Comp(Pv1,v2,v3, Pw1,w2,w3) + Comp(Pv1,v2,w3, Pw1,w2,v3)

+ Comp(Pv1,w2,v3 , Pw1,v2,w3 ) + Comp(Pv1,w2,w3, Pw1,v2,v3 ) = 0.

The second order compatibility conditions provides some necessary conditions
for the following natural question:

Whether two given n-Lie algebra structures Q and R come from a common
(n + 1)-Lie algebra structure, i.e. whether Q = Pu, R = Pv for an (n + 1)-Lie
algebra P and some u, v ∈ V ?

Corollary 2 If n-Lie algebra structures Q and R are ﬁrst order hereditary for
an (n + 1)-Lie algebra, then

Comp(Qw, Rz) + Comp(Qz, Rw) = 0,

∀w, z ∈ V.

3 n-Poisson manifolds

The concept of n-Poisson manifold generalize the one of Poisson one (n = 2)
just in the same sense as n-Lie algebras do with respect to Lie algebras. It was
introduced by Takhtajan in [23]. Filippov in his pioneering work [7] gives an
example (see example 8 below) which turned out to be locally equivalent to the
general concept in virtue of an analogue of the Darboux lemma for n-Poisson
structures. This analogue was found recently by Alekseevsky and Guha [1].
Below we present a simple purely algebraic proof of it which is valid in more
general algebraic contexts, for instance, for smooth algebras. Since n-Poisson
structures are special kind of n-Lie algebra ones we can use freely results of the
preceding section in this context.

Deﬁnition 4 Let M be a smooth manifold. An n-Lie algebra structure on
C∞(M )

(f1, ..., fn) → {f1, ..., fn} ∈ C∞(M ),

fi ∈ C∞(M )

is called an n-Poisson structure on M if the map

is a derivation of the algebra C∞(M ).

f → {f, ..., }

Last condition means the Leibniz’s rule with respect to the ﬁrst argument :

{f g, h1, ..., hn−1} = f {g, h1, ..., hn−1} + g{f, h1, ..., hn−1}

(25)

Evidently, due to skew-symmetry, the Leibniz’s rule is valid for all arguments.
An equivalent way to express this property is to say that the operator

deﬁned as

Xf1,...,fn−1 : C∞(M ) → C∞(M )

Xf1,...,fn−1(g) = {f1, ..., fn−1, g}

is a vector ﬁeld on M . Such a ﬁeld is called Hamiltonian corresponding to the
Hamiltonian functions f1, ..., fn−1.

A manifold supplied with an n-Poisson structure is called n-Poisson or
It is natural to interpret a vector ﬁeld on M as

Nambu-Poisson manifold.
an 1-Poisson structure on it.

Vector ﬁelds on M that are derivations of the considered n-Poisson struc-
ture are called canonical (with respect to it). As in the classical case n = 2
Hamiltonian ﬁelds of an n-Poisson structure are, obviously, canonical ﬁelds.

Let M and N be n-Poisson manifolds and { , }M and { , }N be the corre-

sponding brackets. A map F : M → N is said to be Poisson if

{F ∗(f1), ..., F ∗(fn)}M = F ∗({f1, ..., fn}N ) ∀f1, ..., fn ∈ C∞(M )

(28)

Example 7 [7] Let X1, ..., Xn be commuting vector ﬁelds on M . Then

{f1, ..., fn} = detkXi(fj)k

(29)

is an n-Poisson structure on M . More generally, if A is a commutative algebra,
any set of n commuting derivations of it deﬁnes an n-Poisson structure on it.
Note also that the so-deﬁned n-Poisson structure is invariant with respect to
a unimodular transformation of ﬁelds Yi = Pj sij Xj, detksijk = 1,
sij ∈
C∞(M ).

13

More generally if [ Xj, Xk] = cl
cl
jk ∈ C∞(M ), we have {f1, ..., fn} =
detkXi(fj)k is an n-Poison structure on M .

jkXl,

n-Poisson structures are multiderivations, i.e. multilinear operators on the
algebra C∞(M ) which are derivations with respect to any of their arguments.
This is a particular case of the general concept of multidiﬀerential operator on
C∞(M ) (more generally, on a commutative algebra A [26]). It means that for
any i = 1, 2, ..., k the correspondence

f → ∆(f1, ...fi−1, f, fi+1, ..., fk)

(30)

is a diﬀerential operator for any ﬁxed set of functions f1, .., fi−1, fi+1, .., fk.
When dealing with multidiﬀerential operators and, in particular, with multi-
derivations we will adopt the notation of the previous section. For instance, we
write f ⌋ or ıf for the insertion operator. For instance, if ∆ is a k-diﬀerential
operator, then f ⌋∆ = ıf (∆) = ∆f are three diﬀerent notations for the (k − 1)-
diﬀerential operator

(f ⌋∆)(g1, ...gk−1) = ∆(f, g1, ...gk−1)

(31)

Note the one-to-one correspondence between k-contravariant tensors T and

k-derivations ∆ given as

dfk⌋...⌋df1⌋T = T (df1, ..., dfk) = ∆(f1, ..., fk)

(32)

If, moreover, T is skew symmetric, then it is a k-vector. In particular, an n-
Poisson structure can be given either by a skew symmetric n-derivation, or by
the k-vector corresponding to it .

The mentioned one-to-one correspondence between skew-symmetric multi-
derivations and multi-vectors allows to carry well-known operations from the
latters over the formers. For instance, the standard wedge product of two multi-
vectors allows to deﬁne the wedge product of the corresponding multiderivations
∆ and ∇ as

(∆ ∧ ∇)(f1, ..., fk+l) = X
I

(−1)(I, ¯I)∆(fI )∇(f ¯I )

(33)

1 ≤ i1 ≤ . . . ≤ ik ≤ k + l, is an increasing subsequence of
where I = (i1, ..., ik),
(I, ¯I) is the corresponding per-
integers, ¯I is its complement in {1, 2, ..., k + l},
(−1)(I, ¯I) stands for the sign of it and fI (respectively
mutation of 1, 2, ..., k + l,
f ¯I ) is a shortnoting for fi1 , ..., fik (respectively f¯ı1, ..., f¯ıl). Moreover, deﬁnition
(33) makes sense, in fact, for arbitrary multi-diﬀerential operators, not neces-
sarily derivation, and therefore, deﬁnes an associative and graded commutative
multiplication over them.

The Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket carried over multi-derivations looks as

⌈∆, ∇⌋(f1, ..., fk+l−1) = X

(−1)(I, ¯I)∆(fI , ∇(f ¯I ))

|I|=k−1

14

(−1)(J, ¯J)∇(∆(fJ ), f ¯J )

(34)

− X
|J|=k

where I and J stand, as before, for increasing subsequence of {1, 2, ..., k + l − 1}
while |I|(respectively, |J|) denotes the length of I (respectively, J). Similarly
to (33), formula (34) remains meaningful for arbitrary skew-symmetric multi-
diﬀerential operators and this way the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket is extended
on them. More exactly, deﬁning the Schouten grading of k-diﬀerential operators
to be equal k − 1, we have:

Proposition 5 The Schouten graded skew-symmetric multi-diﬀerential opera-
tors supplied with the bracket operation (34) form a graded Lie algebra, i.e.

⌈∆, ∇⌋ = −(−1)(k−1)(l−1)⌈∇, ∆⌋

(35)

(graded skew-symmetry) and

(−1)(k−1)(m−1)⌈∆, ⌈∇, 2⌋⌋+
(−1)(m−1)(l−1)⌈2, ⌈∆, ∇⌋⌋+
(−1)(l−1)(k−1)⌈∇, ⌈2, ∆⌋⌋ = 0

(graded Jacobi identity)

Proof. Graded skew-commutativity is obvious while the graded Jacobi iden-

tity is checked by a direct but tedious computation. ⊲

Corollary 3 The well-known compatibility condition ⌈∆, ∇⌋ = O of two Pois-
son structures ∆(f, g) = {f, g}I and ∇(f, g) = {f, g}II is in the considered
context identical to the one given in the preceding section.

Proof. Just to compare (12) for n = 2 and (34) for k = l = 2.

Remark 4 It is worth to emphasize that the Lie derivative of a multi-vector V
corresponds in the aforementioned sense to the Lie derivative in the sense of the
previous section of multi-derivation ∆ corresponding to V . In particular, the
fact that V is an n-Poisson multi-vector can be seen as

Xf1,...,fn−1(V ) = 0

(36)

where X(V ) is a short notation for the Lie derivative LX (V ) of
V we shall
use to simplify some formulae. Similarly, the compatibility condition of two
n-vectors V and W can be written in the form

Yf1,...,fn−1(V ) + Xf1,...,fn−1(W ) = 0

(37)

where Xf1,...,fn−1 and Yf1,...,fn−1 are Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds with the same
Hamilton functions f1, ..., fn−1 in the sense of Poisson structures given by V
and W , respectively.

15

A function g ∈ C∞(M ) is said to be a Casimir function if

Xf1,...,fn−1(g) = {f1, ..., fn−1, g} = 0,

∀f1, ..., fn−1 ∈ C∞(M ).

(38)

All Casimir functions form, evidently, a subalgebra K of C∞(M ). We denote
it also Cas(P ) when it becomes necessary to refer to the n-Poisson structure P
in question and call it the Casimir algebra . An ideal I of the Casimir algebra
allows to restrict the original n-Poisson structure to the submanifold (possibly
with singularities)

N = {x ∈ M | f (x) = 0,

f ∈ I} ⊆ M.

To see this note that

C∞(N ) = C∞(M )/IC∞(M )

(39)

(40)

if N is a submanifold without singularities. Otherwise, deﬁne the smooth
function algebra on N by means of (40). Further note that the ideal I∗ =
IC∞(M ) ⊆ C∞(M ) is stable (with respect to the n-Poisson structure in ques-
tion) in the sense that {f1, ..., fn−1, g} ∈ I∗ if g ∈ I∗. This allows one to deﬁne
the restricted n-Poisson structure on N just by passing to quotients

{

(41)

f1, ...,

(mod I∗). From a geometrical point of view the stability of I∗
where
implies that Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are tangent to N . The smallest of such
submanifolds N correspond to the largest, i.e. maximal, ideals of K. Since any
non wild maximal ideal of K is of the form I = ker G where G : K → R is a R-
homomorphism of unitary R-algebras it is reasonable to limit our considerations
to these ones. Denote by NG the submanifold of M corresponding to the ideal
I = kerG and recall that all R-homomorphisms of K constitute a manifold
(with singularities) SpecRK, the real spectrum of K, in such a way that K =
C∞(SpecRK). We shall call it the Casimir manifold of the considered n-Poisson
structure and denote it by Cas(M ) or Cas(P ) depending of the context. Then
the canonical embedding K ⊆ C∞(M ) induces by duality the Casimir map

Cas : M → Cas(M )

(42)

By construction NG = Cas−1(G). This way one gets the Casimir ﬁbration of M
whose ﬁbres are n-Poisson manifolds. In the Casimir ﬁbration it is canonically
inscribed the Hamiltonian foliation which is deﬁned as follows. First, note that
the commutator of two Hamiltonian ﬁelds is a sum of Hamiltonian ﬁelds. In
fact, formula 9 in the considered context looks as

[Xf1,...,fn−1, Xg1,...,gn−1] = X
i

Xg1,...,{f1,...,fn−1,gi},...,gn−1

(43)

16

This implies that the C∞(M )-module H(P ) of vector ﬁelds generated by all
Hamiltonian ones is closed with respect to the Lie commutator operation. It
deﬁnes, therefore, a (singular) foliation on M called Hamiltonian. It was already
mentioned that Hamiltonian ﬁelds are tangent to submanifolds NG . Hence, any
Hamiltonian leaf, i.e. that of the Hamiltonian foliation, belongs to a suitable
Casimir submanifolds NG. So, Casimir submanifolds are foliated by Hamilto-
nian leaves.

Example 8 Let T n+1 be the standard (n + 1)-dimensional torus with standard
angular coordinates θ1, θ2, ..., θn+1. Consider the n-Poisson structure on it de-
ﬁned by vector ﬁelds

X1 =

+ λ

, X2 =

, ..., Xn =

∂θ1

∂
∂θn+1

as in example 7. Then for a rational λ Cas(T n+1) = S1 and the Casimir map
Cas : T n+1 → S1 is a trivial ﬁbre bundle with T n as ﬁbre. In this case ﬁbres
of the Casimir map are identical to leaves of the Hamiltonian foliation. If λ is
irrational, then Cas(T n+1) is just a point what is equivalent to K = R. In other
words, T n+1 is the unique submanifold of the form NG. On the other hand, the
Hamiltonian foliation in this case is n-dimensional and its leaves are copies of
Rn immersed everywhere densely in T n+1.

Since Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds are, by construction, tangent to the leaves of
the Hamiltonian foliation, the Poisson multi-vector of the considered Poisson
structure is also tangent to them. For this reason on any such a leaf there
exists an unique n-Poisson structure such that the canonical immersion L ֒→ M
becomes an n-Poisson map. In the next section it will be shown that Poisson
leaves are either n-dimensional (regular), or 0-dimensional (singular) if n > 2
what is in a strong contrast with the classical case n = 2. By this reason n-
Poisson structures on n-dimensional manifolds are to be described. We will get
it as a particular case of the following general assertion.

Proposition 6 Let P be an n-Poisson structure of rank n on a manifold M .
Then for any f ∈ C∞(M ), f P is an n-Poisson structure and any two structures
of this form are compatible.

Proof. It is based on the general formula

Lf X(Q) = f LX (Q) − X ∧ (f ⌋Q)

(45)

for any f ∈ C∞(M )
instance,[2]). By applying it to X = Ph1,...,hn−1 and Q = gP,
and taking into account that Ph1,...,hn−1(P ) = 0 one ﬁnds

, X ∈ D(M ) and a multi-vector Q on M (see, for
g ∈ C∞(M )

(f P )h1,...,hn−1(gP ) = f Ph1,...,hn−1(g)P − Ph1,...,hn−1 ∧ (gPf )

(46)

17

This formula allows to rewrite the compatibility condition (12) for f P and gP
as

(f P )h1,...,hn−1(gP ) + (gP )h1,...,hn−1(f P ) =
f Ph1,...,hn−1(g)P + gPh1,...,hn−1(f )P − Ph1,...,hn−1 ∧ (gPf + f Pg) =
Ph1,...,hn−1(f g)P − Ph1,...,hn−1 ∧ ((f g)⌋P ) = (f g)⌋(Ph1,...,hn−1 ∧ P )

It remains to note that Ph1,...,hn−1 ∧ P = 0 for a multi- vector of rank n.

⊲

Corollary 4 Any Frobenius n-vector ﬁeld V on a manifold M is an n-Poisson
one. In particular, such is any n-vector ﬁeld on an n-dimensional manifold M .

Proof. Since V deﬁnes an n-dimensional distribution (with singularities) on M
it can be locally presented as V = hX1 ∧ ... ∧ Xn for a suitable h ∈ C∞(M ).
But X1 ∧ ... ∧ Xn is just the Poisson structure of example 7 and, so, V is also
an n-Poisson structure in virtue of proposition 6.⊲

4 Decomposability of n-Poisson structures.

In this section we prove a result which, in a sense, is an analogue of the Dar-
boux lemma for n-Poison structures with n > 2. It tells that the range of a
non-trivial Poisson n-vector is equal to n and, therefore, such a n-vector is lo-
cally decomposable. This was conjectured by Takhtajan and proved recently by
Alexeevsky and Guha [1]. Our approach is, however, quite diﬀerent. We start
with collecting and recalling some elementary facts of multi-linear algebra.

Let V be a ﬁnite dimensional vector space. Denote by Λk(V) its k-th exterior

power and put for V ∈ Λk(V) and a1, ..., al ∈ V ∗

Va1,...,al := al⌋ ...⌋ a1⌋ V ∈ Λk(V)

(47)

The following is well-known.

Lemma 1 A non-zero k-vector V ∈ Λk(V) is decomposable, i.e. V = v1∧...∧vk,
for some vi ∈ V, iﬀ it is of rank k.

Vectors vi’s are deﬁned uniquely up to an unimodular transformation vi →
wi = Pj cij vj. The subspace of V generated by v1, ..., vk coincides with that
generated by all vectors of the form Va1,...,ak−1 ∈ V .

Recall also the

Lemma 2 If v ∧ V = 0, v ∈ V, V ∈ Λk(V), then V is factorized by v, i.e.
V = v ∧ V ′ for a V ′ ∈ Λk(V) .

Together with lemma 1 this implies the following .

Lemma 3 A k-vector V is decomposable iﬀ
∀a1, ..., ak−1 ∈ V ∗.

Va1,...,ak−1 ∧ V = 0,

18

Lemma 4 (on 3 planes). Let Π1, Π2, Π3 be (k − 1)-dimensional subspaces of V
such that dim(Πi ∩ Πj) = k − 2 for i 6= j.

If k > 2, then

• the span Π of Π1, Π2, Π3 is k-dimensional,

• any (k − 1)-dimensional subspace Π′ of V intersecting each of Πi’s along

not less than a (k − 2)- dimensional subspace belongs to Π.

Proof Obvious. ⊲

Proposition 7 Let V be a k-vector, k > 2. If

Va,c1,...,ck−2 ∧ Vb + Vb,c1,...,ck−2 ∧ Va = 0,

∀a, b, c1, ..., ck−2 ∈ V ∗,

(48)

then V is decomposable.

Proof. By putting a = b in (48) we see that Wc1,...,ck−2 ∧ W = 0 for W = Va.
Therefore, according to lemma 3, the (k −1)-vector Va is decomposable ∀a ∈ V ∗.
Denote now by Πa the (k − 1)-dimensional subspace of V canonically associ-
ated, according to lemma 1, with the decomposable (k −1)-vector Va required to
be diﬀerent from zero. If Va,c1,...,ck−2 ∧Vb = 0 for all c1, ..., ck−2 ∈ V∗, then Πa =
Πb as it results from lemma 2 and lemma 1. If,otherwise, Va,c1,...,ck−2 ∧ Vb 6= 0
consider the subspace Π associated according to lemma 1 with the decomposable
k-vector Va,c1,...,ck−2 ∧ Vb. Obviously, Π ⊃ Πb.

On the other hand, equality (48) shows that Π coincides with the subspace
associated with the decomposable k-vector Vb,c1,...,ck−2 ∧ Va = 0. By this reason
Π ⊃ Πa and, therefore, dim(Πa ∩ Πb) ≥ k − 2 > 0. Moreover, if Va,b 6= 0, then
dim(Πa ∩ Πb) = k − 2. In fact, dim(Πa ∩ Πb) = k − 1 implies that Πa = Πb and,
hence, Va = λVb from which Va,b = λVb,b = 0 what is impossible.

Observe, ﬁnally, that since V 6= 0 and k ≥ 3 there exist a, b, c ∈ V ∗ such that
Va,b,c 6= 0. In such a situation (k − 2)-vectors Va,b, Vb,c and Va,c are diﬀerent
from zero. Hence, as we have already previously seen, mutual intersections
Πa, Πb and Πc are all (k − 2)-dimensional. So, these three subspaces satisfy
the hypothesis of lemma 4. By this reason the span Π of them contains all
subspaces Πd, d ∈ V ∗, and consequently all derived vectors Vd,d1,...,dk−2 belong
to Π. Now lemma 1 implies the desired result. ⊲

Our next task is to show that the hypothesis of proposition 7 is satisﬁed by
any Poisson multi-vector. First, we need the following property of Lie deriva-
tions.

Lemma 5 Let X ∈ D(M ) and f ∈ C∞(M ). For a multi-derivation ∆ it holds

Lf X(∆) = f LX(∆) − X ∧ ∆f

(49)

19

Proof. By the deﬁnition of the Lie derivative we have

Lf X(∆)(g1, ..., gn) = f X(∆(g1, ..., gn)) − X
i
= f (X(∆(g1, ..., gn) − X
i

∆(g1, ..., f X(gi), ..., gn)

∆(g1, ..., X(gi), ...gn))

(−1)i−1X(gi)∆(f, g1, ..., gn).

− X
i

It remains to note that last sum is just the product X∧∆f evaluated on g1, ..., gn.
⊲

Next identity is basic.

Proposition 8 Let ∆ be an n-derivation. Then for any f, g, φi ∈ C∞(M ) it
holds:

∆f g,φ1,...,φn−2(2) = f ∆g,φ1,...,φn−2(2) +
g∆f,φ1,...,φn−2(2) − ∆f,φ1,...,φn−2 ∧ 2g −
∆g,φ1,...,φn−2 ∧ 2f

Proof. First, note that ∆f g = f ∆g + g∆f so that one has

∆f g,φ1,..,φn−2(2) = (f ∆g,φ1,..,φn−2)(2) + (g∆f,φ1,..,φn−2)(2)

On the other hand, by putting Y = ∆f,φ1,...,φn−2, Z = ∆g,φ1,...,φn−2 and apply-
ing lemma 5 one ﬁnds

∆f g,φ1,...,φn−2(∆f ) = (LgY + Lf Z)(2) =
⊲

gLY (2) + f LZ(2) − Y ∧ 2g − Z ∧ 2f

(50)

(51)

Corollary 5 If ∆ is an n-Poisson structure, then for any f, g, φi ∈ C∞(M ) it
holds

∆f,φ1,...,φn−2 ∧ ∆g + ∆g,φ1,...,φn−2 ∧ ∆f = 0

(52)

Proof. Formula (50) for an n-Poisson ∆, and 2 = ∆ is reduced, obviously, to
(52)

⊲

Remark 5 Formula (52) for n = 2 becomes empty. We mention also the fol-
lowing particular case of (52) for which g = f :

∆g,φ1,...,φn−2 ∧ ∆g = 0

(53)

Theorem 1 Any non trivial n-Poisson n-vector V is of rank n if n > 2.

20

Proof. Formula (52) can be rewritten as

(dφn−1⌋ ...dφ1⌋ df ⌋ V ) ∧ (dg⌋ V )+
(dφn−1⌋ ...dφ1⌋ dg⌋ V ) ∧ (df ⌋ V ) = 0

Evaluated at a point x ∈ M it ensures the hypothesis (48) of proposition 7 for
the n-vector Vx over the tangent space V = TxM . Therefore, Vx is of rank n or
identically equal to zero, otherwise. ⊲

Corollary 6 For n > 2 regular leaves of the Hamiltonian foliation of an n-
Poisson manifold are n-dimensional. Its singular leaves are just points.

Remark 6 Since an n-dimensional foliation can be given by means of n com-
muting vector ﬁelds in a neighborhood of its regular point, example 7 exhausts
regular local forms of n-Poisson structures for n > 2.

Another eventually very important consequence of theorem 1 is that the carte-
sian product of two n-Poisson manifolds is not in a natural way a such one if
n > 2. In fact, there is no natural way to construct an n-dimensional foliation
on the cartesian product of two manifolds supplied with such ones.

Theorem 1 shows n-Poisson structures for n > 2 to be extremely rigid what
implies some peculiarities going beyond the binary based expectations. Below
we exhibit two of them: no cartesian products and no (in general) n-Poisson
structure on the dual of an n-Lie algebra.

First, note that given two n-vector ﬁelds P and Q on manifolds M and N ,
respectively, their direct sum P ⊕ Q which is an n-vector ﬁeld on M × N is
naturally deﬁned.

Corollary 7 If P and Q are non-trivial n-Poisson vector ﬁelds, then P ⊕ Q is
not an n-Poisson one for n > 2.

Proof. Just to note that rank (P ⊕ Q) = rank(P ) + rank(Q).
This result can be also proved by a direct computation.
Second, given an n-Lie group structure [·, . . . , ·] on V one can try to associate
with it an n-Poisson structure on its dual V ∗ just by copying the standard
construction for n = 2. Namely, let x1, . . . , xN ∈ V be a basis. Interpreting xi’s
to be coordinate functions on V ∗, let us put

⊲

T = X

[xi1 , . . . , xin ]

∧ . . . ∧

(54)

∂
∂xi1

∂
∂xin

1≤i1<...<in≤N

In a coordinate-free form the n-vector ﬁeld T can be presented as

T (df1, . . . , dfn)(u) = [duf1, . . . , dufn]

21

with u ∈ V ∗ and fi ∈ C∞(V ∗) where the diﬀerential dufi of fi at the point u
is interpreted canonically to be an element of V. This n-vector ﬁeld T is called
associated with the n-Lie algebra structure in question.

It is well known (for instance, [25]) this formula deﬁnes the standard Poisson

structure on V ∗ when n = 2. However, it is no longer so when n > 2.

Corollary 8 If n > 2 the n-vector ﬁeld T given by (54) is not generally an
n-Poisson one.

Proof. First, note that the n-vector ﬁeld associated with the direct product of
two n-Lie algebras is the direct sum of n-vector ﬁelds associated with each of
them. Since, obviously, the n-vector ﬁeld associated with a non-trivial n-Lie
algebra is of rank not less than n, the n-vector ﬁeld associated with the product
of two non-trivial n-Lie algebras is of rank not less 2n. Therefore, it cannot be
an n-Poisson vector if n > 2

⊲.

On the other hand we have:

Proposition 9 Formula (54) deﬁnes an n-Poisson structure on the dual of an
n-Lie algebra of dimension ≤ n + 1.

Proof. As it easy to see any n-vector deﬁned on a space of dimension ≤ n + 1
is either of rank n or 0. So, under the hypothesis of the proposition T deﬁnes
an n-or 0-dimensional distribution on V ∗. Denote by ∆ the n-derivation on V ∗
corresponding to T as in (54). It suﬃces to show that

∆f1,...,fn−1(∆) = 0

(55)

for any system of polynomials fi(x) in variables xk’s. We prove it by induction
on the total degree δ = degf1 + . . . + degfn−1 by starting from δ = n − 1.

To start the induction note that in the case all fi’s are linear on V ∗, i.e.
elements of V, identity (55) is identical to the n-Jacobi identity of the original
n-Lie algebra.

To complete the induction it is suﬃcient to show that (55) holds for the
system f1 = gh, f2, . . . , fn−1 if it holds for g, f2, . . . , fn−1 and h, f2, . . . , fn−1.
Taking into account that ∆gh,f2,...,fn−1 = g∆h,f2,...,fn−1 + h∆g,f2,...,fn−1 and
lemma 5 the problem is reduced to prove that

∆g,f2,...,fn−1 ∧ ∆h + ∆h,f2,...,fn−1 ∧ ∆g = 0

(56)

But since T is of rank n ∆ϕ1,...,ϕn−1 ∧ ∆ = 0 for any system ϕ1, . . . , ϕn−1 ∈
C∞(V ∗) we have

0 = h ⌋ (∆g,f2,...,fn−1 ∧ ∆) = ∆(g, f2, . . . , fn−1, h)∆ − ∆g,f2,...,fn−1 ∧ ∆h,

so that

∆g,f2,...,fn−1 ∧ ∆h = ∆(g, f2, . . . , fn−1, h),

22

and, similarly,
∆h,f2,...,fn−1 ∧ ∆g = ∆(h, f2, . . . , fn−1g).
Hence, (56) results from skew symmetry of ∆.
Previous discussions leads us to conjecture that:
If n > 2 any n-Lie algebra is split into the direct product of a trivial n-Lie
algebra and a number of non-trivial n-Lie algebras of dimensions n and (n + 1).
In fact, this conjecture saves in essence the fact that an n-Lie algebra struc-
ture generates an n-Poisson structure on its dual (Proposition 9) in view of
the resistance of n-Poisson manifolds to form cartesian products (corollary 7) if
n > 2. Also, at least to our knowledge, all known examples in the literature are
in favor of this conjecture.

⊲

Finally, mention an alternative (and also natural) way to save the dual con-
struction by giving to the concept of n-Poisson manifold the dual meaning (see
[27]). For fundamentals of this dual approach we send the reader to [19]. A
discussion of the Koszul duality can be found in [15] and [9].

We conclude this section by answering the natural question: what are mul-
tiplicative compatibility conditions for two multi-Poisson structures, i.e. condi-
tions ensuring that their wedge product is again a multi-Poisson one.

Proposition 10 Let ∆ and ∇ be the multi- Poisson structures on the mani-
fold M whose multiplicities coincide with their rank (for instance, they are of
multiplicities greater than two.) Then ∆ ∧ ∇ is a multi-Poisson structure on
M iﬀ ⌈∆, ∇⌋ = 0, ∆g1,...,gk−1 (∇) ∧ ∇ = 0, ∇h1,...,hl−1(∆) ∧ ∆ = 0 for all
gi, hj ∈ C∞(M ), k and l denoting the multiplicities of ∆ and ∇, respectively.

Proof. First, note the formula which is a direct consequence of the wedge product
deﬁnition:

(∆ ∧ ∇)f1,...,fN = X
I

(−1)(k−|I|)(N −|I|)+(I, ¯I)∆fI ∧ ∇f ¯I

(57)

where I runs all ordered subsets of {1, . . . , N } and |I| denotes the cardinality
of I. In particular, for N = k + l − 1 we have

(∆∧∇)f1,...,fk+l−1 = X
|I|=k

(−1)(I, ¯I)∆(fI )∇f ¯I + X

(−1)l+(I, ¯I)∇(f ¯I )∆fI (58)

|I|=k−1

By applying lemma 5 to f = ∆(fI ), X = ∇f ¯I and taking into account that
∇f ¯I (∇) = 0 and ∇f ¯I ∧ ∇ = 0

(∇ is l-Poisson of rank l) we ﬁnd

(∆(fI )∇f ¯I )(∆ ∧ ∇) = ∆(fI )∇f ¯I (∆) ∧ ∇ − (−1)k∇f ¯I ∧ ∆ ∧ ∇∆(fI )

(59)

and, similarly,

(∇(f ¯I )∆fI )(∆ ∧ ∇) = ∇(f ¯I )∆ ∧ ∆fI (∇) − ∆fI ∧ ∆∇(f ¯I ) ∧ ∇

(60)

23

0 = ∇(f ¯I )⌋(∆fI ∧ ∆) = ∆(fI , ∇(f ¯I ))∆ − ∆fI ∧ ∆∇(f ¯I )

Since ∆fI ∧ ∆ = 0, then

that is

and, similarly,

∆fI ∧ ∆∇(f ¯I ) = ∆(fI , ∇(f ¯I ))

∇f ¯I ∧ ∇∆(fI ) = ∇(f ¯I , ∆(fI ))

Now bearing in mind (58)-(62) we get

(−1)(I, ¯I)(∆(fI )∇f ¯I (∆) ∧ ∇ − ∇(f ¯I , ∆(fI ))∆ ∧ ∇)

(−1)l+(I, ¯I)(∇(f ¯I )∆ ∧ ∆fI (∇) − ∆(fI , ∇(f ¯I ))∆ ∧ ∇)

(∆ ∧ ∇)f1,...,fk+l−1(∆ ∧ ∇)
= X
|I|=k
+ X

|I|=k−1

= X
|I|=k

(−1)(I, ¯I)∆(fI )∇f ¯I (∆) ∧ ∇ + X

(−1)l+(I, ¯I)∇(f ¯I )∆ ∧ ∆fI (∇)

−(−1)l⌈∆, ∇⌋(f1, . . . , fk+l−1)

|I|=k−1

(see (34)). If ∆ ∧ ∇ is a multi-Poisson structure, then it is also a multi-Poisson
structure in the dual sense deﬁned in [19]. But for such structures ∆∧∇ is multi-
Poisson iﬀ ⌈∆, ∇⌋ = 0. This shows that ⌈∆, ∇⌋ = 0 is a necessary condition for
the considered problem.

Observe now that due to local decomposability of multi-vector corresponding
to ∆ and ∇ the product ∆ ∧ ∇ is diﬀerent from zero iﬀ they are transversal
to each other. This implies that the leaves of the corresponding Hamiltonian
foliations intersect one another transversally. By this reason one can ﬁnd k
local Casimir functions of ∇, say f1, . . . , fk, such that ∆(f1, . . . , fk) 6= 0 and l
Casimir functions of ∆, say fk+1, . . . , fk+l such that ∇(fk+1, . . . , fk+l) 6= 0. For
such chosen fi’s all summands of the ﬁrst two summations of (63) vanish except
one which is

∆(f1, . . . , fk)∇fk+1,...,fk+l−1 (∆) ∧ ∇.

if ∆ ∧ ∇ is (k + l)-Poisson. Observing
This implies ∇fk+1,...,fk+l−1(∆) ∧ ∇ = 0,
then that local Casimir functions of both ∆ and ∇ generate in that situation a
local smooth function algebra, one can conclude that

for any family of functions g1, . . . , gl−1.

Similarly, it is proved that

∇g1,...,gl−1 (∆) ∧ ∇ = 0

∆g1,...,gl−1 (∇) ∧ ∆ = 0

This shows that (64),(65) and ⌈∆, ∇⌋ = 0 are necessary. Their suﬃciency is
obvious from (63).

5 Local n-Lie algebras.

In this section we discuss the most general natural synthesis of the concept of
multi-Lie algebra and that of smooth manifold which is as follows.

Deﬁnition 5 A local n-Lie algebra structure on a manifold M is an n-Lie al-
gebra structure

on C∞(M ) which is a multi-diﬀerential operator.

(f1, ..., fn) → [f1, ..., fn]

Below we continue to use the operator notation as well as the bracket one for
local n-ary structures :

∆(f1, ..., fn) = [f1, ..., fn]

and refer to the multi-diﬀerential operator ∆ as the structure in question itself.

Example 9 n-Poisson structures are local n-Lie algebra ones.

A well-known result by Kirillov [11] says that for n = 2 the bi-diﬀerential oper-
ator giving a local Lie algebra structure on a manifold M is of ﬁrst order with
respect to both its arguments. An interesting algebraic proof of this fact can
be found in [10]. Kirillov’ s theorem is generalized immediately to higher local
multi-Lie algebras.

Proposition 11 Any local n-Lie algebra, n ≥ 2 is given by an n-diﬀerential
operator of ﬁrst order, i.e. of ﬁrst order with respect each its argument.

It results from Kirillov’s theorem applied to (n − 2)-order hereditary

Proof.
structures of the considered algebra.

⊲
Recall that usual Lie algebra structures deﬁned by means of ﬁrst order bi-
diﬀerential operators are called Jacobi’s [11, 16, 12]. This motivates the following
terminology.

Deﬁnition 6 An n-Jacobi manifold (structure) is a manifold M supplied with
a local n-Lie algebra structure on C∞(M ) given by a ﬁrst order n-diﬀerential
operator.

Hence, in these terms proposition 11 says that multi-Jacobi structures exhaust
local multi-Lie algebra ones. Note, however, that it seems not to be the case for
inﬁnite dimensional manifolds such that occur in Secondary Calculus. Kirillov
gives also an exhaustive description of Jacobi manifolds.

Namely, Kirillov showed that a binary Jacobi bracket [· , ·] on a manifold

M can be uniquely presented in the form

[f, g] = T (df, dg) + f X(g) − gX(f )

25

with X and T being a vector ﬁeld and a bivector ﬁeld, respectively, such that
kT, T k = X ∧ T and LX(T ) = 0 Then two qualitative diﬀerent situations can
occur: X ∧T ≡ 0 and X ∧T 6= 0 (locally). In the ﬁrst of them the bivector T is a
Poissonian of rank 0 or 2. In the latter case X is a locally Hamiltonian ﬁeld with
respect to T , i.e. X = Tf for an appropriate f ∈ C∞(M ). If X ∧T 6= 0,then M is
foliated (with singularities) by (2n + 1)-dimensional leaves with 2n = rankT (an
analog of the Hamiltonian foliation) and the original Jacobi structure is reduced
to a family of locally contact brackets [16, 12] on leaves of this foliation.

Below we ﬁnd an n-ary analogue of Kirillov’s theorem for n > 2 showing
that in this case only the ﬁrst possibility of two mentioned above survives.
Fundamental here is a canonical decomposition of the ﬁrst order skew-symmetric
multi-diﬀerential operator ∆ deﬁning the local n-Lie algebra in question which
we are passing to describe.

Recall, ﬁrst, that a ﬁrst order linear (scalar) diﬀerential operator on M is a

R-linear map ∇ : C∞(M ) → C∞(M ) such that

∇(f g) = f ∇(g) + g∇(f ) − f g∇(1)

∀f, g ∈ C∞(M ).

(66)

This algebraic deﬁnition is equivalent to the standard coordinate one [12]. It
characterizes vector ﬁelds on M , i.e. derivations of C∞(M ), as ﬁrst order diﬀer-
ential operators ∇ such that ∇(1) = 0. Let ∆ be a skew-symmetric ﬁrst order
n-diﬀerential operator. According to the adopted notation ∆1 is an (n − 1)-
diﬀerential operator deﬁned as ∆1(f1, ..., fn−1) = ∆(1, f1, ..., fn−1). Obviously,
it is of ﬁrst order. Moreover, it is a multi-derivation. In fact, it is seen immedi-
ately from what was said before by observing that owing to skew-commutativity

∆1(1, ...) = (∆1)1 = ∆1,1 = 0

(67)

If Γ is a skew-symmetric k-derivation, then the (k + 1)-diﬀerential operator s(Γ)
deﬁned as

s(Γ)(f1, ..., fk+1) = X
i

(−1)i−1fiΓ(f1, ..., fi−1, fi+1, ..., fk+1).

(68)

is, obviously, skew-symmetric and of ﬁrst order. Moreover, s(Γ)1 = Γ. By
applying this construction to Γ = ∆1 we obtain the ﬁrst order skew- symmetric
n-diﬀerential operator ∆0 = s(∆1) such that (∆0)1 = ∆1. Last relation shows
that the n-diﬀerential operator ˆ∆ = ∆ − ∆0, is an n-derivation. Now gathering
together what was done before we obtain :

Proposition 12 With any ﬁrst order skew-symmetric n-diﬀerential operator ∆
are associated skew-symmetric multi-derivations ∆ and ∆1 of multiplicities n
and n − 1, respectively, such that (canonical decomposition)

∆ = ˆ∆ + ∆0

(69)

26

with ∆0 = s(∆1), i.e.

∆0(f1, ..., fn) = X
i

(−1)i−1fi∆1(f1, ..., fi−1, fi+1, ..., fn).

(70)

Conversely, any pair (∇, Γ) of skew-symmetric derivations of multiplicities n
and n−1, respectively, deﬁnes an unique skew-symmetric n-diﬀerential operator
of ﬁrst order ∆ = ∇ + s(Γ) such that ∇ = ˆ∆ and Γ = ∆1. ⊲

It is natural to extend the operation s from the skew-symmetric derivations to
arbitrary skew-symmetric multi-diﬀerential operators. Namely, if ∆ is a skew-
symmetric k-diﬀerential operator, then we put

s(∆)(g1, ..., gk+1) =

(−1)i−1gi∆(g1, ..., gi−1, gi+1, ..., gk+1)

k+1

X
i=1

This way we get the map

s : Dif f alt

l|k (M ) → Dif f alt

l|k+1(M ),

l|k (M ) denoting the space of l-th order C∞(M ) -valued skew-symmetric

Dif f alt
k-diﬀerential operators on C∞(M ).

Proposition 13 The operation s is C∞(M )−linear and s2 = 0.

Proof. Obvious. ⊲

Remark 7 Proposition (13) shows that s can be viewed as the diﬀerential of
the complex:

0 → Dif f alt

l|1 (M )

s
→ Dif f alt

l|2 (M )

s
→ ...

s
→ Dif f alt

l|k (M )

s
→ ...

This complex is acyclic in positive dimensions and its 0-cohomology group is iso-
morphic to C∞(M ). In fact, the insertion of the unity operator i1 is a homotopy
operator for s as it results from Proposition 12.

Further properties of s we need are the following.

Proposition 14 The operation s has the properties:

1. If X ∈ D(M ), then [LX , s] = 0

2. If f ∈ C∞(M ), then f ⌋s(2) + s(f ⌋2) = f 2 and
3. s(2)f1,...,fk = Pi(−1)i−1fi2f1,...,fi−1,fi+1,...,fk + (−1)k2(f1, ..., fk)

27

Proof. We start with number 1.

For 2 ∈ Dif f alt

l|k (M ) one has by deﬁnition

(−1)j−1gj2(g1, .., gj−1, gj+1, .., X(gi), .., gk+1)

(−1)j−1gj2(g1, .., X(gi), .., gj−1, gj+1, .., gk+1)

j<i

Therefore,

j<i

(−1)i−1giX(2)g1, ..., gi−1, gi+1, ..., gk+1) = s(LX (2))(g1, ..., gk+1)

= X
i

Thus, s ◦ LX = LX ◦ s ⇔ [LX , s] = 0.

Property 2 is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of s . Finally, 3 is

obtained from 2 by an obvious induction. ⊲

We need also the following formula concerning Lie derivative

Lemma 6 If f ∈ C∞(M ) and 2 is a skew-symmetric k-derivation, then

Lf (2) = (1 − k)f 2 − s(2f )

where the Lie derivative Lf is understood in the sense of section 2.

28

Proof. By deﬁnition

Lf (2)(g1, ..., gk) = f · 2((g1, ..., gk) − X(g1, ..., f gi, ..., gk)
= f · 2(g1, ..., gk) − X

(f · 2(g1, ..., gk) + gi2(g1, ..., gi−1, f, gi+1, ..., gk)

= (1 − k)f 2(g1, ..., gk) + X(−1)i−1gi2(f, g1, ..., gi−1, gi+1..., gk)

i

But last summation coincides, obviously, with −s(2f )(g1, ..., gk). ⊲

Proposition 12 suggests to treat the problem of describing n-Jacobi struc-
tures as determination of conditions to impose on a pair of multi-derivations
∇ and 2 of multiplicities n and n − 1, respectively, in order the n-diﬀerential
operator ∆ = ∇ + s(2) be an n-Jacobi one. In other words, we have to resolve
the equation:

(∇ + s(2))f1,...,fn−1(∇ + s(2)) = 0

(71)

with respect to ∇ and 2. So we pass to analyze equation (71)
First, by applying proposition (14, 3) and posing Xi = 2

f1,..., ˆfi,...,fn−1

and

h = (−1)n−12(f1, ..., fn−1) one ﬁnds

s(2)f1,...,fn−1(∇) = X(−1)i−1(fiXi)(∇) + Lh(∇)

The following expression is computed with the help of lemmas 5 and 6:

s(2)f1 , ..., fn−1(∇) = X(−1)i−1(fiXi(∇)−Xi ∧∇fi )+(1−n)h∇−s(∇h) (72)

Similarly, taking into account proposition (14,1), lemma 5, lemma 6 and the
fact that s(2)f1,...,fn−1 = Y + h with Y = P(−1)i−1fiXi ∈ D(M ) one ﬁnds
s(2)f1,...,fn−1(s(2)) = (Y + h)(s(2)) = s(Y (2)) + (1 − n)hs(2)
= s(X(−1)i−1fiXi(2) − X(−1)i−1Xi ∧ 2fi + (1 − n)h2)

(73)

Putting together formulae (72) and (73) we obtain the key technical result of
this section.

Proposition 15 Let ∇ and 2 be skew-symmetric multi-derivations of mul-
tiplicity n and n − 1, respectively, then the canonical decomposition of the skew-
symmetric k-diﬀerential operator

(∇ + s(2))f1,...,fn−1(∇ + s(2))

is given by the formula:

(∇ + s(2))f1,...,fn−1(∇ + s(2)) = ∆1 + s(∆o)

Corollary 9 If ∆ + s(2) is n-Jacobian, then for any g1, ...gn−2 ∈ C∞(M )

2g1,...,gn−2(∇) = 0 and 2g1,...,gn−2(2) = 0

In particular, 2 is an (n − 1)-Poisson structure.

Proof. In virtue of proposition 15 equation (71) is equivalent to

∆o(f1, ..., fn−1) = 0

It remains to note that

to apply lemma 5.

Corollary 12 If ∇ + s(2) is n-Jacobian, then the n-vector, corresponding to
∇ is locally either of rank n (i.e locally decomposable) for n > 2, or trivial.

⊲

Proof. Observe that theorem 1 results from formula (52) which is identical to
(77).

Denote by V and W multi-vectors corresponding to ∇ and 2 respectively.
Let Πx and Px, x ∈ M be subspaces of TxM generated by derived vectors of
Vx and Wx respectively.

31

Proposition 17 If ∇ + s(2) is n-Jacobian with n > 2, then rank(Wx) ≤ n − 1
and Px ⊂ Πx if Vx 6= 0
Proof. Relation 2g1,...,gn−2(∇) = 0 (corollary 9) implies

2ϕ,g1,...,gn−3 ∧ ∇ψ + 2ψ,g1,...g1−3 ∧ ∇ϕ = 0

(78)

This can be proved repeating literally the reasoning used above to deduce for-
mula (52). In terms of multi-vectors relation (78) is equivalent to

(dgn−3⌋...⌋dg1⌋dϕ⌋W ) ∧ (dψ⌋V ) + (dgn−3⌋...⌋dg1⌋dψ⌋W ) ∧ (dϕ⌋V ) = 0 (79)

In particular, for ϕ = ψ we have

(dgn−3⌋...⌋dg1⌋dϕ⌋W ) ∧ (dϕ⌋V )

(80)

By lemma 2 (80) shows that the derived vector

(dgn−3⌋...⌋dg1⌋dϕ⌋W )

divides dϕ⌋V . Since V is of rank n it divides also V . This proves the inclusion
Px ⊂ Πx.

Further, being W (n − 1)-Poissonian (corollary 9) rank(W ) ≤ n − 1 if
n > 3. For n = 3 the inclusion Px ⊂ Πx shows that rank(W ) ≤ 3 due to
decomposability of V . But the rank of a bi-vector is an even number. So,
rank(W ) ≤ 2.

⊲

Corollary 13 If ∇ + s(2) is n-Jacobian with n > 2, then Xi ∧ ∇ = 0 and
Xi ∧ 2 = 0.

Proof. Xi is a derived vector of W and, due to inclusion Px ⊂ Πx, is also a
derived vector of V . It remains to observe that a decomposable multi-vector
vanishes when being multiplied by any of its derived vectors. ⊲

Corollary 14 If ∇ + s(2) is n-Jacobian with n > 2, then

∇f1,...,fn−1(∇) = 0
∇f1,...,fn−1(2) = ∇h
In particular, ∇ is an n-Poisson structure on M .

(81)

(82)

Proof. Immediately from corollary 10. ⊲

Below it is supposed that ∆ = ∇ + s(2) deﬁnes an n-Jacobi structure on M
with n > 2. A point x ∈ M of that n-Poisson manifold is called regular if both
multi-vectors V and W corresponding to ∇ and 2, respectively, do not vanish
at x. Note that the inclusion Px ⊂ Πx (proposition 17) implies that x is regular
if 2 is regular at x , i.e. Wx 6= 0.

Now we can prove the main structural result concerning n-Jacobian mani-

folds with n > 2.

32

Theorem 2 Let ∆ be a non-trivial n-Jacobi structure and n > 2. Then in a
neighborhood of any of its regular points it is either of the form ∆ = ∇ + s(∇h)
where ∇ is a non-trivial n-Poisson structure, or ∆ = s(2) where 2 is an (n−1)-
Poisson structure (of rank 2 if n = 3).

Proof. Corollary 9 and proposition 17 show that 2 is an (n−1)-Poisson structure
of rank ≤ n − 1 on M while corollaries 12 and 14 show ∇ to be an n-Poisson
one of rank n. Hamiltonian foliations of these two multi-Poisson structures
(we call them 2-foliaton and ∇-foliation, respectively) are regular foliations of
dimensions n−1 and n, respectively, in a neighborhood of a regular point a ∈ M .
Moreover, 2-foliation is inscribed into ∇-foliation according to proposition 17.
So, if the neighborhood U of a is suﬃciently small there exist a system of
functionally independent functions y, z1, ..., zm−n, m = dimM such that they
all are constant along leaves of the 2-foliation and z1, ..., zm−n are constant
along leaves of the ∇-foliation.

Since 2 is (n − 1)-Poisson of rank n − 1 there exist (locally) mutually com-
muting vector ﬁelds X1, ..., Xn−1 such that 2 = X1∧, ..., ∧Xn−1. We can
assume that Xi ∈ D(U). Then it is easy to see that there exist functions
x1, ..., xn−1 ∈ C∞(U) such that Xi(xj ) = δij. Vector ﬁelds Xi’s are, obvi-
ously, tangent to leaves of 2- foliation and, therefore, Xi(y) = Xi(zj) = 0,
∀j.
By construction functions x1, ..., xn−1, y, z1, ..., zm−n are independent (function-
ally). So they form a local chart in U in, maybe, smaller neighborhood of a.
Now vector ﬁelds Xi’s are identiﬁed with ∂
’s, partial derivations in the sense
∂xi
of the above local chart. Note also, that the vector ﬁeld ∂
∂y is tangent to leaves
of ∇-foliation. By construction the n-vector V is tangent also to this leaves. By
this reason ∇ = λ ∂

∧, ..., ∧ ∂
is a 2-Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld associated with the

sition of ∆, i.e. ∆ = s(2), corollaries 9 and 13 show that 2 is an (n − 1)-Poisson
structure of rank n − 1. (In virtue of theorem 1 last condition is essential only
if n = 3.) On the other hand, one can see easily that when ∇ ≡ 0 any such
Poisson structure satisﬁes conditions ∆1 = 0, ∆o = 0 of proposition 15. ⊲

Proposition 18 Let ∇ be an n-Poisson structure of rank n on M and f ∈
C∞(M ). Then ∆ = ∇ + s(∇f ) is an n-Jacobi structure. In particular, this is
the case for any n-Poisson ∇ with n > 2.

Proof. With the notation of proposition 15 Xi = ∇f,f1,...,fi−1,fi+1,...,fn−1 and
2 = ∇f . By this reason Xi(∇) = 0 as well as ∇f1,...,fn−1(∇) = 0.

Therefore, the n-diﬀerential operator ∆1(f1, ..., fn−1) (proposition 15) is re-

duced to

(−1)i−1fi⌋(Xi⌋)∇. Moreover, Xi⌋∇ = 0 due to the fact that ∇ is

n−1
P
i=1

of rank n. Hence, in the considered context ∆1(f1, ..., fn−1) = 0
Next, Xi(∇f ) = 0 since ∇f is an (n − 1)-Poisson structure.
By applying formula (10)

for δ = ∇f1,..,fn1 and u = f we see that for

h = (−1)n−12(f1, .., fn−1) = (−1)n−1∇(f, f1, .., fn−1)

∇f1,...,fn−1(∇f ) − ∇h = f ⌋∇f1,...,fn−1(∇) = 0

n−1
P
k=1

So, the (n − 1)-diﬀerential operator ∆o(f1, ..., fn−1) (proposition 15) is reduced

to

(−1)i−1fi⌋(Xi ∧ ∇f ). But ∇f is obviously, of rank ≤ n − 1 and so

Xi ∧∇f = 0. Hence, ∆o(f1, ..., fn−1) = 0 which proves that ∆ is n-Jacobian. ⊲
The construction of proposition 18 can be generalized as follows. Let ω be a
closed diﬀerential form of order 1. For a multi-derivation ∇ deﬁne another one
∇ω by putting locally ∇ω = ∇f if ω = df . This deﬁnition is, obviously, correct
and allows to globalize proposition 18.

Proposition 19 If ∇ is an n-Poisson structure of rank n, then ∆ = ∇+ s(∇ω)
is an n-Jacobi structure for any closed diﬀerential 1-form ω.

34

Proof. It results directly from proposition 18 and from the fact that the n-Jacobi
identity for ∆ is a multi-diﬀerential operator. ⊲

∂θn+1

Example 10 With notation of example 8 consider the (n+1)-Poisson structure
∇ = ∂
on (n + 1)-torus T n+1. Then ∇ω with the closed but not
∂θ1
exact on T n+1 1-form ω = αdθ1 − dθ2 gives the n-Poisson structure described
in example 8. Therefore the (n − 1) -Jacobi structure ∆ = ∇ + s(∇ω) on T n+1
is such that the leaves of its 2-foliation are everywhere dense in the unique leaf,
T n+1, of its ∇-foliation.

It is not diﬃcult to show that any n-Jacobi with n > 2 structure on an n-
dimensional manifold is of the form ∇ + s(∇ω) for suitable closed 1-form ω and
n-Poisson structure ∇ on M .

6 n-Bianchi classiﬁcation

In view of the conjecture of sect. 3 on the structure of n-Lie algebras for n > 2 a
classiﬁcation of (n+1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras turns out to be of a particular
interest. Such a classiﬁcation, an analogue of that of Bianchi for 3-dimensional
Lie algebras, is, in fact, already done in [7] by a direct algebraic approach.
Below we get it in a transparent geometric way which, in addition, reveals some
interesting peculiarities.

To start with, observe that on an orientable (n + 1)-dimensional manifold

M any n-vector P can be given in the form

P = α⌋V

with an 1-form α = αP,V and a (prescribed) volume (n + 1)-vector ﬁeld V
on M , respectively. Obviously, α⌋P = 0. This means that α vanishes on the
n-dimensional distribution deﬁned by P .

If P is an n-Poisson one, this distribution is tangent to the corresponding
Hamiltonian foliation and as such is integrable. Therefore, α ∧dα = 0. In virtue
of proposition 6 this condition is suﬃcient for P to be an n-Poisson vector ﬁeld.
Let us call an n-Poisson structure unimodular with respect to V if, for any

n-Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld X, LX (V ) = 0

Proposition 20 An n-Poisson structure P is V -unimodular iﬀ dαP,V = 0

Proof. Recall the general formula

LX (α⌋V ) = α⌋LX (V ) − LX (α)⌋V

(85)

which holds for arbitrary vector ﬁeld X, diﬀerential form α and multi-vector
ﬁeld V . If X is a P -Hamiltonian ﬁeld with P = α⌋V , then LX (α⌋V ) = 0 and
(85) gives

α⌋LX (V ) = LX(α)⌋V

35

Since, also, X⌋α = 0 LX(α) = X⌋dα and the last equality can be rewritten as

divV X · P = (X⌋dα)⌋V

(86)

due to the fact that LX (V ) = divV X · V . So, divV X = 0 ⇔ LX (V ) = 0 for any
P -Hamiltonian ﬁeld X if dα = 0.

Conversely, (86) shows that X⌋dα vanishes for any P -Hamiltonian ﬁeld X
if P is V -unimodular. This implies that Y ⌋dα = 0 for any Y tangent to the
hamiltonian foliation of P . Since this foliation is of codimension 1 any decom-
posable bi-vector B on M can be presented at least locally, in form B = Z ∧ Y
with Y as above. This shows that BJ⌋dα = 0 for any decomposable B and,
hence, dα = 0.

⊲

Now we specify the above construction to the case M = V ∗, V being an
(n + 1)-dimensional vector space and P = T , T being the n-Poisson structure
on V ∗ associated with an n-Lie algebra structure on V. Also, we consider the
(n + 1)-vector ﬁeld V = ∂
on V where xi’s are some cartesian
∂x1
∂xn+1
coordinates on V ∗. Such an (n+1)-ﬁeld is deﬁned uniquely up to a scalar factor.
So, the above concept of unimodularity does not depend on the choice of such
a V and the 1-form αT,V is deﬁned uniquely up to a scalar factor. Note also
that αT,C is linear in the sense that the function Ξ⌋αT,C is linear on V ∗, i.e. an
element of V, for any constant vector ﬁeld Ξ. In coordinates this means that
αT,V looks as

∧ . . . ∧ ∂

αT,V = X
i,j

aijxjdxi,

aij ∈ R

Proposition 21 Algebraic variety of n-Lie algebra structures on V is identical
to the variety of linear diﬀerential 1-forms on V ∗ satisfying the condition α ∧
dα = 0.

Proof. It was already shown that any n-Lie algebra structure on V is character-
ized uniquely by the corresponding linear diﬀerential 1-form αT,C.

Conversely, if α is a linear diﬀerential 1-form, then n-ary operation on
C∞(V ∗) deﬁned by n-vector ﬁeld α⌋V is closed on the subspace of linear func-
tions on V ∗, i.e. on V. This way one gets an n-ary operation on V . The
condition α ∧ dα = 0 guarantees integrability of the n-distribution on V ∗ de-
ﬁned by P = α⌋V and by virtue of the corollary 4 it is an n-Poisson structure.
This fact restricted on V shows the above n-ary operation to be an n-Lie one.
⊲

Note now that any linear diﬀerential 1-form on V ∗ can be identiﬁed with a
bilinear 2-form b on V ∗. Namely, denote by Cω the constant ﬁeld of vectors on
V ∗ which are equal to ω ∈ V ∗ and put

b(ω, ρ) := (Cω⌋α, ρ), ω, ρ ∈ V ∗,

36

where bracket (·, ·) stands for a natural pairing of V and V ∗. Obviously,

b(ω, ρ) = X

and α = P aijxj dxi. So, kaijk is the matrix of

An n-Lie algebra is called unimodular if all its inner derivations are unimod-
ular operators. For an (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras this is, obviously,
equivalent to unimodularity of the associated Poisson structure T on V ∗ with
respect to a cartesian volume (n + 1)-vector V . On the other hand, T is V -
unimodular iﬀ dαT,V = 0 (proposition 20) and for a linear diﬀerential 1-form α
the condition dα = 0 is equivalent to α = dF for a bilinear polynomial F on V ∗
(or to symmetry of the corresponding quadratic form b). These considerations
prove the following result.

Proposition 22 The n-Poisson structure T on V ∗ associated with an unimod-
ular Lie algebra structure on an (n + 1) - dimensional vector space V is of the
form dF ⌋V for a suitable quadratic polynomial F on V ∗. Therefore, all uni-
modular n-Lie structures on V are mutually compatible. Two such structures
are isomorphic iﬀ the corresponding quadratic polynomials can be reduced one
to another up to a scalar factor by a linear transformation. In particular, for
k = R isomorphic classes of unimodular (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie structures
can be labeled by two numbers: r (the rank of F ),
0 ≤ r ≤ n + 1 and m (the
maximal of positive and negative indices of F ), r

⊲

2 ≤ m ≤ r.

Passing now to the case dαT,V 6= 0 we note that dαT,V is a constant diﬀerential
2-form on V ∗ due to linearity of αT,V . Moreover, the condition αT,V ∧dαT,V = 0
shows that the rank of dαT,V is equal to 2. Therefore, dαT,V = dx1 ∧ dx2 in
suitable cartesian coordinates on V ∗. Since αT,V divides dx1 ∧ dx2 and is linear
it must be of the form

2

X
i=1

µij xjdxi with µ21 − µ12 = 1.

This is equivalent to say that dαT,V = dq + 1

2 (x1dx2 − x2dx1) with

q = q(x1, x2) =

(µ11x2

1 + (µ12 + µ21)x1x2 + µ22x2

2).

2

Note that unimodular transformations of variables does not alter the form of
the skew-symmetric part of αT,V . So, by performing a suitable such one it is
possible to reduce q(x1, x2) to a diagonal form:

αT,V = d(µy2

1 + νy2

2) +

(y1dy2 − y2dy1)

2

37

Further, transformations of the form (y1, y2) → (λy1, ±λ−1y2) and the possibil-
ity to change the sign of αT,V allows to bring it to one of the following canonical
forms

Proposition 23 n-Lie algebras corresponding to the 1-form αT,V of the list
(87) are mutually non isomorphic and, therefore, label isomorphic classes of
non-unimodular (n + 1) -dimensional n-Lie algebras.

Proof. Previous considerations show that any non-unimodular (n+1)-dimensio-
nal n-Lie algebra is isomorphic to one of the list (87). Two algebras of the type
Ψ±
λ (n) corresponding to diﬀerent λ are not isomorphic since non-vanishing of
the skew-symmetric part of αT,V is equivalent of non-unimodularity condition.
On the other hand, λ is a an invariant of isomorphism type since 2
λ is equal to
the area of a (quasi-) orthonormal base of the symmetric part of αT,V measured
by means of its skew-symmetric part. Other types diﬀer by rank or signature
of the symmetric part.

⊲

The classiﬁcation we have got has an interesting internal structure. Namely,
denote by B(n) the isomorphism type of (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras cor-
responding to the generating polynomial 1
1. Then any (n + 1)-dimensional al-
gebra can be seen as a ”molecule” composed of B(n) and Ψ(n) types of ”atoms”.
More exactly, the above discussion can be resumed as follows

2 x2

Proposition 24 Any (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebra can be realized as the
sum of mutually compatible algebras each of them being either of type B(n) or
of type Ψ(n).

On the base of the obtained classiﬁcation it is not diﬃcult to describe completely
the derivation algebras of (n + 1)-dimensional n-Lie algebras.

An linear operator A : W → W is called an inﬁnitesimal conformal symmetry

of a bilinear form b(u, v) on W if

b(Au, v) + b(u, Av) = tr(A)b(u, v)

(88)

Proposition 25 The Lie algebra of derivations of an (n+1)-dimensional n-Lie
algebra coincides with the algebra of inﬁnitesimal conformal symmetries of its
generating bilinear form.

38

Proof. A linear operator A on a linear space can be naturally interpreted as a
linear vector ﬁeld X on it. Moreover, tr(A) = div(X). Formula (85) for such a
ﬁeld X which is also a symmetry of α⌋V reduces to

α⌋LX (V ) = LX(α)⌋V

which is identical to (88).

⊲

We omit a complete description of the derivation algebras which can be
easily got by applying the previous proposition. Just note that inner derivations
exhaust all derivations of an (n + 1)-dimensional algebra iﬀ the rank of its
generating form is equal to n+1. The following example illustrate some features
of outer derivations.

Previous method used to get the n-Bianchi classiﬁcation can be extended
to inscribe into the n-ary context inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras too. This is
well illustrated by the following example.

erated by ei ,

7 Dynamical aspects

A Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XH1,..,Hn−1 associated with an n-Poisson structure
can be called n-Poisson, or Nambu dynamics. The corresponding equation of
motion is

= XH1,H2,...,Hn−1f = {H1, H2, ..., Hn−1, f }

(90)

df
dt

An important peculiarity of a Nambu dynamics is that it admits at least
n − 1 independent constants of motion, namely H1, ..., Hn−1. Also such a dy-
namics admits n − 1 diﬀerent but mutually compatible Poisson descriptions.
The corresponding i-th (usual) Poisson bracket and Hamiltonian are

{f, g}i = {H1, ..., Hi−1, Hi+1, ..., Hn−1, f, g} and (−1)n−1Hi,

respectively.

So, the fact that a dynamics is a Nambu one can be exploited with the use.

Below we give some examples of that.

7.1 The Kepler dynamics

Occasionally, a dynamical vector ﬁeld Γ admitting 2n−1 constants of the motion
on a 2n-dimensional manifold M , is called hyper-integrable or degenerate.

In these cases denoting with LΓ the Lie derivative with respect to Γ and

with

If f1, f2, ..., f2n−1 are ﬁrst integrals for Γ and f2n ∈ C∞(M ) is such that

Γ(f2n) = 1, then the 2n-Poisson bracket

The Kepler dynamics illustrates such a situation
Recall that the Kepler vector ﬁeld, in spherical-polar coordinates (r, θ, ϕ) in

R3 − {0} , is given by:

Γ =

with (pr, pθ, pϕ) canonical conjugate variables.

(95)

with Hamiltonian H given by (see, for instance [13]):

p2
ϕ

h ∈ (1, 2, 3) (see, for instance [22]),
the Kepler Hamiltonian H, the symplectic form ω and the vector ﬁeld Γ become:

Functionally independent constants of the motion are:
f1 = J1, f2 = J2, f3 = J3, f4 = ϕ1 − ϕ2, f5 = ϕ2 − ϕ3
Now it is easy to see that (97) becomes 6-Hamiltonian with respect to (93)

with ν =

with F = ν
So

{h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6} = ν

∂(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
∂(J1, J2, J3, ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3)

(98)

provides us with a 6-ary bracket for the Kepler dynamics.

In terms of this bracket, the equations of the motion looks as:

df
dt

= ν{J1, J2, J3, ϕ1 − ϕ2, ϕ2 − ϕ3, f }

(99)

By ﬁxing same of the functions h’s we get hereditary brackets.

7.2 The spinning particle

Given a dynamics, i.e. a vector ﬁeld Γ on a manifold M , it colud be interesting
to realize it as a Hamiltonian ﬁeld with respect to a Poisson structure [4]. Below
it wil be shown how multi-Poisson structures can be used in this connection.

We shall ignore the spatial degree of freedom of the particle and study only
the spin variables. Let us denote the spin variables S = S1, S2, S3 as elements
in R3. The equations for these variables when the particle interacts with an
external magnetic ﬁeld B = B1, B2, B3 are given by:

dSi
dt

= µǫijkSjBk

(100)

where µ denotes the magnetic moment.

This dynamics has two ﬁrst integrals, namely, S2 = S2

3 and
S · B = S1B1 + S2B2 + S3B3 and, in addition, is canonical for the ternary
bracket associated with the 3-vector ﬁeld

∧

(101)

where f is a ﬁrst integral of it.

All Poisson structures obtained by ﬁxing a function F = F (S2, S · B), are
preserved by the dynamics and are mutually compatible. The corresponding
Poisson bracket is:

{Sj, Sk}f

F = f ǫjkl

Now we show how the ternary Poisson structure (101) allows for the alter-

native ordinary Poisson brackets described in [4]:

For this choice the algebra generated by the Poisson brackets on linear
functions is the su(2) Lie algebra. The Hamiltonian function for the dy-
namics is the standard one H = −µS ˙B.

parameter and the standard description is recovered for λ 7→ 0.

The hereditary Poisson brackets are:

{S2, S3}f
{S1, S3}f
F = 1
2

F = S1
F = S2

sinh2λS3
sinhλ

{S1, S2}f

These brackets are a classical realization of the quantum commutation
relations for generators of the Uq(sl(2)) Hopf algebra.

We also notice that this Poisson Bracket is compatible with the previous
one as they are hereditary from the same ternary structure (101).

• Another non-standard description

There is another choice for f and F which is known to correspond to the
classical limit of the Uq(sl(2)) Hopf algebra.

43

It is

f =

S3, F = S2

1 + S2

2 + S2

3 + S−2
3

λ
4

It leads to the following brackets:

{S2, S3}f
{S1, S3}f

F = λ
2 S1S3
F = λS2S3
2 [S2

3 − S−2
3 ]

{S1, S2}f

F = λ

With respect to this Poisson bracket dynamics (100) becomes Hamiltonian
with Hamiltonian function:

H = −

lnS3

2µB
λ

with the magnetic ﬁeld along the third axis.

Of course dynamics (100) admits many other Poisson realizations of this

type.

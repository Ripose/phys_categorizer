Abstract
The polarization properties of monochromatic light beams are studied. In
contrast to the idealization of an electromagnetic plane wave, ﬁnite beams
which are everywhere linearly polarized in the same direction do not exist.
Neither do beams which are everywhere circularly polarized in a ﬁxed plane.
It is also shown that transversely ﬁnite beams cannot be purely transverse in
both their electric and magnetic vectors, and that their electromagnetic
energy travels at less than c. The electric and magnetic ﬁelds in an
electromagnetic beam have different polarization properties in general, but
there exists a class of steady beams in which the electric and magnetic
polarizations are the same (and in which energy density and energy ﬂux are
independent of time). Examples are given of exactly and approximately
linearly polarized beams, and of approximately circularly polarized beams.

1. Introduction

(1)

An electromagnetic wave is speciﬁed in terms of the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds E and B. For monochromatic waves of
angular frequency ω we can write [1, 2]
E(r, t) = Re{E(r)e−iωt } = Er (r) cos ωt + Ei (r) sin ωt
B(r, t) = Re{B(r)e−iωt } = Br (r) cos ωt + Bi (r) sin ωt
where Er and Ei are the real and imaginary parts of the
complex vector E(r), and likewise for B(r). The polarization
properties of the wave usually refer to those of the electric
ﬁeld. For the plane wave in vacuum, E(r) = E0eik·r, we have
B(r) = k−1k×E(r) where k = ω/c and k gives the direction
of propagation, so E and B have the same polarization
properties, but in general the polarization properties of E and
B will differ. There exists a special class of monochromatic
beams (steady beams, introduced in section 4 of [3] and studied
in more detail in section 4 of [4]) for which E(r) = ±iB(r)
and for these beams the polarization properties of the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds are the same, as we shall see shortly.

At a ﬁxed point in space, the endpoint of the vector E(r, t)
describes an ellipse in time 2π/ω (see for example [2, section
1.4.3]): one can write

Er + iEi = (E1 + iE2)eiγ

(2)

and γ can be chosen so that the real vectors E1 and E2 are
perpendicular. This value of γ is given by

tan 2γ = 2Er · Ei
− E 2
E 2

i

.

(3)

Since E1 = Er cos γ + Ei sin γ and E2 = −Er sin γ +
Ei cos γ , in the plane of (Er , Ei ) or (E1, E2) the electric ﬁeld
E(r, t) = Re{(E1 + iE2)ei(γ −ωt)}

= E1 cos(ωt − γ ) + E2 sin(ωt − γ )

(4)
has orthogonal components E1 and E2 (when γ satisﬁes (3))
with magnitudes given by

E1 and E2 give the lengths of the semiaxes of the polarization
ellipse. E2 is zero for linear polarization, for which we
therefore need Er and Ei to be collinear:

The condition for Er and Ei to be collinear can also be written
as Er × Ei = 0. The square of this relation reduces to (6).

We can deﬁne a degree of linear polarization (cid:4)(r),
depending on position within the monochromatic coherent
beam under consideration; for the electric polarization this is

As an example of polarization in monochromatic light
beams, consider the TM (transverse magnetic) beams [3, 6]
characterized by a vector potential aligned with the beam axis,

with an analogous expression for the magnetic polarization.
When the real and imaginary parts of E(r) = Er (r) + iEi (r)
are collinear, which is the condition (6) for linear polarization,
(cid:4) is unity. When Er and Ei are orthogonal and equal in
magnitude, the conditions for circular polarization (7), (cid:4) is
zero. Note that the conditions (7) for circular polarization can
be condensed into E2 = 0 for the complex ﬁeld E = Er +iEi :
the complex ﬁeld is nilpotent on the curve C where it is
circularly polarized.
(A measure of the degree of circular
polarization is 1 − (cid:4).) From (5) we have

where e is the eccentricity of the polarization ellipse, given by
e2 = 1 − (E2/E1)2. Thus e2 has the same limiting values of
unity and zero for linear and circular polarization as does (cid:4):
e2 = 2(cid:4)/(1 + (cid:4)).

For steady beams, within which both the energy ﬂux
E(r, t) × B(r, t) and
(Poynting vector) S(r, t) = c
4π
(E 2(r, t) + B 2(r, t)) are
the energy density u(r, t) = 1
8π
independent of time, we have [3, 4] E(r) = ±iB(r) so
that Br = ±Ei and Bi = ∓Er . For electromagnetic
steady beams, therefore, the electric and magnetic polarization
properties are identical, since the angle γ is the same for E(r)
= B 2
and B(r), and E 2
2 .

A simple example of differing electric and magnetic
polarization properties is provided by electric dipole radiation.
The complex ﬁelds are (see e.g. [1], section 9.2)

and therefore the magnetic ﬁeld is everywhere linearly
polarized (along the direction of ˆr × p), but the electric ﬁeld
is in general elliptically polarized, with only one surface on
which the polarization is exactly linear, as we shall see below.
Nisbet and Wolf [5] have considered electromagnetic
waves within which one of the ﬁeld vectors is everywhere
linearly polarized. The direction of polarization is ﬁxed at
a given point in space, but ‘may be different at different points
in the ﬁeld’. In fact we shall show in the next section that a
ﬁnite beam with either E or B everywhere linearly polarized
in the same ﬁxed direction cannot exist.

and thus Br and Bi are collinear, and the magnetic ﬁeld is

and is thus elliptically polarized, in general. Note that E has
a longitudinal component, the necessity of which was noted
in [7]. In fact we shall see in the next section that ﬁnite beams
cannot be purely transverse in both electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
Nye and Hajnal [8–12] have studied and classiﬁed the
polarization of electromagnetic waves by means of their
geometric properties. The location of circular polarization of
the electric ﬁeld of a monochromatic wave is speciﬁed by (7).
These two conditions, Er · Ei = 0 and E 2
i , each
r
determine a surface in space, and the two surfaces intersect
on a curve C on which the electric ﬁeld is circularly polarized.
Likewise, the location of linear polarization is determined by
one condition (6), namely (Er · Ei )2 = E 2
i . This equation,
or equivalently the condition that Er and Ei be collinear (which
includes as a special case that one of them be zero), determines
a surface S in space. In a given plane, e.g. z = constant, the S
surface intersects a curve on which the polarization is linear,
although the ﬁeld direction in general varies along the curve.
The curve C does not cross an S surface (the ﬁeld cannot
be both circularly and linearly polarized at any point), except
possibly at a point where the ﬁeld is zero.

By way of example, the electric ﬁeld of a radiating electric
is never circularly polarized. The

condition for linear polarization is that E 2

zero. This expression factors to 4 p4k6r −6 cos2 θ sin2 θ , where
θ is the angle between p and r. Thus the electric ﬁeld is
linearly polarized in the equatorial plane θ = π/2, where it
takes the value E = pr −3[(kr )2 + ikr − 1]eikr . The electric
ﬁeld is also linearly polarized on the axis of the dipole, where
E = 2pr −3(1 − ikr )eikr . The equatorial plane and the polar

axis may be viewed as parts of the same surface, obtained by
rotating the ‘four-leaf clover’ r 6 = a6 cos2 θ sin2 θ about the
polar axis θ = 0, in the limit as a → ∞.

In sections 3 and 4 we shall examine the polarization
properties of some special beam wavefunctions. Before that,
section 2 gives general results relating to beams.

2. Non-existence theorems for electromagnetic
beams

in which E,
The textbook electromagnetic plane wave,
B and the propagation vector k are everywhere mutually
perpendicular, can be everywhere linearly polarized in the
same direction, or everywhere circularly polarized in the same
plane, and its energy is everywhere transported in a ﬁxed
direction at the speed of light. We shall show that none of
these properties can hold for transversely ﬁnite monochromatic
electromagnetic beams.

Suppose E = (Ex , E y, 0), B = (Bx , By, 0). With time-

exist, in the presence of two or more cylindrical conductors:
see for example section 8.2 of [1].)

Suppose E = (F, 0, 0). Then from ∇ × E = ikB, ∇ × B =

The last two equations imply that F = F(y, z), and thus a
beam everywhere polarized along the x-direction cannot be
localized in the x-direction.

the curl equations of Maxwell give us, with ω = ck,

∇ × Br − kEi = 0,

∇ × Bi + kEr = 0.

Thus F must be a function of z only, i.e. only plane waves can
be everywhere circularly polarized in a ﬁxed plane.

2.4. Beams or pulses within which the energy velocity is
everywhere in the same direction and of magnitude c do not
exist

Suppose the energy velocity ve = 2cE × B/(E 2 + B 2) has
magnitude c everywhere. Then from equation (10) of [4] it
follows that E 2 = B 2 and E · B = 0, everywhere. Let E × B
point in the z direction. Then E y Bz = By Ez, Ez Bx = Bz Ex
and Ex By − Bx E y = (E 2 + B 2)/2. These three conditions,
together with E 2 = B 2 and E · B = 0 have only one real
solution set, namely {Ex = By, E y = −Bx , Ez = 0 = Bz}.
This solution set is consistent with Maxwell’s equations,
provided that

Equations (20) are satisﬁed by Bx and By being arbitrary
functions of z − ct. Equations (21) imply that Bx and By
are harmonic functions in x and y, so that the beam cannot be
localized in the x or y directions. The only beams or pulses in
which energy is everywhere transported in the same direction
at the speed c are unbounded in the transverse directions.

potential directed along the x axis, A = A0(ψ, 0, 0), drawn for
β = 2 in the focal plane. At t = 0 the ﬁeld in the focal plane is
purely longitudinal, at ωt = π/2 it is purely transverse. The electric
ﬁeld is exactly linearly polarized in the x = 0 plane, where it is also
exactly transverse, along ˆx. The transverse ﬁeld has zeros on the
∂ρ2 + k2ψ = 0 (when β = 2 and ψ = ψ00 the ﬁrst
x-axis, when
zeros are at k|x| ≈ 5.23); there the electric ﬁeld is purely
longitudinal, and is again linearly polarized. The ﬁeld is null at
k|y| ≈ 3.4: see the caption to ﬁgure 3.

Thus the ﬁelds given in (24) are clearly not linearly polarized
everywhere, except in the plane wave limit. B is linearly
polarized along ˆy in the y = 0 plane (sin φ = 0), while E is
linearly polarized along ˆx in the x = 0 plane (cos φ = 0).

Figure 2 shows the electric ﬁeld lines for the ‘LP’ beam
with vector potential A = A0(ψ, 0, 0), and ﬁgure 3 gives the
contours of constant (cid:4). We see from (24) that the electric
ﬁeld is exactly linearly polarized (along ˆx) in the x = 0 plane.

(where (cid:4) = 1) out along the x-axis, the (cid:4) values ﬁrst decrease
steadily to zero (the ﬁrst curves of circular polarization intersect the

linear polarization) at k|x| ≈ 5.23. The cycle then repeats, with a
decrease till the other side of the circular polarization curve is met at
k|x| ≈ 5.62. The next perfect linear polarization is at k|x| ≈ 8.02
(all numbers are for ψ00 with β = 2). Along the y-axis the
polarization is linear everywhere, since there the electric ﬁeld is
proportional to

Consider now the behaviour near the beam axis. When ψ is
even in ρ, as is the case in all the examples in (25) and (26),
we can write

ψ(ρ, z) = ψ0(z) + ρ2ψ2(z) + ρ4ψ4(z) + O(ρ6).

(39)

(For ψ00, ψ0(z) = sin(Z )/Z where Z = k(z − ib).) Then (38)
gives the indicated proportionality to ρ2 for small ρ (primes
indicate differentiation with respect to z):

(cid:4) = ρ2

When dealing with exact solutions of the Helmholtz equation,
we also have (∇ 2 + k2)ψ = 0 satisﬁed to each order in ρ2, so
that

By way of example, the wavefunction ψ00 = sin k R/k R

The complete behaviour in the focal plane is shown in
ﬁgures 4–6, and limiting analytic expressions are given in
appendix B. We see that our steady beam constructed to
have circular polarization in the plane wave limit, with vector
potential given in (32), is exactly circularly polarized on the
beam axis, but that away from the axis the polarization deviates
from exactly circular, in proportion to ρ2 /k2b4 for wide beams,
and in proportion to (kρ)2 for very tightly focused beams
(β = kb large and small compared to unity, respectively).

5. Discussion

We have seen that the ﬁniteness in the transverse directions
of actual electromagnetic beams imposes constraints which
make impossible the usual properties assumed for plane
electromagnetic waves.
Substantial deviations from the
ideal, almost-plane-wave polarization properties [18] are to
be expected in tightly focused beams. In particular, there is a
strong constraint on circular polarization: an example is given
of a class of beams within which there can be exact circular
polarization only on the beam axis, with the deviation from
circular polarization being initially in proportion to the square
of the distance from the beam axis. The broader the beam, the
larger the axial region where the polarization is nearly circular.

S is zero for linear polarization and unity for circular
polarization, while (cid:4) is unity and zero respectively. The two
measures are related by S2 + (cid:4)2 = 1. The Hurwitz measure
has the advantage that for monochromatic unpolarized light it
is uniformly distributed between zero and one. The ratio of

The polarization measures (cid:4)(r) or S(r) characterize the
polarization of a monochromatic beam at the point r. They
both range from 0 to 1, with the extremes corresponding
to circular and linear polarization. Both (cid:4) and S can be
written in terms of the lengths of the real orthogonal vectors
E1(r) and E2(r) deﬁned in terms of Er (r) and Ei (r) in
section 1: see (44) and (45). The plane of the polarization
ellipse is the plane of Er , Ei or E1, E2. An equivalent
characterization can be given in terms of the Stokes parameters
(see for example [2, sections 1.4.2 and 10.8.3], where the
Stokes parameters are deﬁned for harmonic plane waves and
for quasi-monochromatic plane waves, respectively), provided
we understand their deﬁnition to be local in the case of beams,

Appendix A. The polarization of an ‘LP’ beam, with
ψ = ψ00

(46)

The polarization measure (cid:4) for the A = A0(ψ, 0, 0) ‘linearly
polarized’ beam is given in (27). The simplest exact beam
wavefunction, ψ00 = sin k R/k R, R2 = ρ2 + (z − ib)2, is best
handled in oblate spheroidal coordinates (ξ, η), since these are
proportional to the real and imaginary parts of R [3, 17]. We
have, with β = kb,

(cid:13)

ρ = b

(1 + ξ 2)(1 − η2),

R = b(ξ − iη),

z = bξ η,
ψ00 = sin β(ξ − iη)
β(ξ − iη)

.

(A.1)

The differentiations with respect to ρ and z required in the
evaluation of (cid:4) can be converted to ξ and η differentiations
as given in equations (A.1)–(A.5) of [3]. The complete
expression for (cid:4) (which depends on β, ξ , η, cos βξ , sin βξ ,
cosh βη and sinh βη) is too lengthy to be given here. We shall
give only the expressions for the polarization evaluated in the
focal plane z = 0. There are two regions to be considered:
the disc ρ (cid:1) b, and the remainder of the z = 0 plane, ρ (cid:2) b.

These correspond to

Both ξ and η are zero on the circle {z = 0, ρ = b}. On this
circle (cid:4) takes the value

(cid:4)c =

10(5 + β 2 cos2 φ)
50 + β 2(β 2 + 10) cos2 φ

.

(A.3)

As expected, this is unity along the y-axis, where cos φ = 0.
(cid:4)c is nearly unity for all φ for small β, but for large β it takes
the small value 10/β 2 except in the immediate neighbourhood
of cos φ = 0, where it rapidly increases to unity. The degree
of linear polarization within the near region (the disc ρ (cid:1) b)
in the focal plane has the limiting values for large and small β

For any β, the asymptotic value of (cid:4) far from the axis is unity:

Both limits give unity (perfect linear polarization) at the origin,
where η → 1. In the far region, ρ (cid:2) b, we ﬁnd the large and
small β values to be

ξ 4 + 3(ξ 4 + 7ξ 2 + 6) cos2 φ + O(β).
For any β, the asymptotic value of (cid:4) far from the axis has the
leading terms

(A.5)

(cid:4) f = 1 − 2 cos2 φ
ξ 2 sin2 φ

+ O(ξ −3).

(A.6)

Thus for ρ (cid:9) b the beam is nearly linearly polarized in most
of the focal plane, except close to the x-axis (small φ).

Along the beam axis (ρ = 0) the polarization is
everywhere exactly linear. Near the axis, the deviation of (cid:4)
from unity is proportional to ρ2 cos2 φ times a function of z.

Appendix B. The polarization of a ‘CP’ beam, with
ψ = ψ00

We proceed as in appendix A, evaluating (cid:4) as given in (38)
with ψ = sin k R/k R. Again the complete expression for (cid:4)
is too long to be given here, and we will give only the limiting
expressions for the polarization evaluated in the focal plane
z = 0. In this plane, on the circle ρ = b, (cid:4) takes the value

(cid:4)c =

polarization far from the axis (for ρ (cid:9) b)! Away from the
focal region, however, the polarization is largely circular: the
linear polarization in the far ﬁeld is restricted to the region
cos θ (cid:10) β −1, where θ is the angle to the beam axis.

The energy density for a steady beam can be written as
u = B · B∗/8π (see [4, equation (58)]), and for the ‘CP’ beam
the required scalar product is given in (37). When ψ = ψ00
we ﬁnd that, in the focal plane, u ∼ ρ−2 for ρ (cid:9) b. Thus
the integral of the energy density over the focal plane diverges
logarithmically, as was shown to be the case for the TM, TE
and ‘TEM’ beams with ψ = ψ00 [3].

The energy ﬂux (Poynting vector) for a steady beam can
be written as S = (c/8π)iB × B∗ (see [4, equation (58)]).
When ψ is independent of the azimuthal angle φ,
the
is independent of φ, and the
longitudinal component Sz
transverse components resolve into radial and azimuthal parts
Sρ and Sφ, both of which are independent of φ: Sx =
Sρ cos φ − Sφ sin φ, Sy = Sρ sin φ + Sφ cos φ (as is the case for
the ‘TEM’ beam: [4, see section 6]). In the focal plane, and
with ψ = ψ00, Sρ is zero, and Sz and Sφ have the asymptotic
forms

The angular momentum density is c−2ρ Sφ (see [4, equation
(64)]), and thus for ψ = ψ00 the total angular momentum
for the ‘CP’ beam is logarithmically divergent. These results
reinforce the statement that ‘the usefulness of ψ00 appears to
be limited to the region near the beam axis’ [26].

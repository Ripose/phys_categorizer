The  recent  discovery  of  liquid  water-related  sulphates  on  Mars  is  of  great 

astrobiological  interest.  UV  radiation  experiments,  using  natural  Ca  and  Fe 

sulphates  (gypsum,  jarosite),  coming  from  two  selected  areas  of  SE  Spain 

(Jaroso Hydrothermal System and the Sorbas evaporitic basin), were performed 

using a Xe Lamp with an integrated output from 220 nm to 500 nm of 1.2 Wm-2. 

The  results  obtained  demonstrate  a  large  difference  in  the  UV  protection 

capabilities of both minerals and also confirm that the mineralogical composition 

of the Martian regolith is a crucial shielding factor. Whereas gypsum showed a 

much higher transmission percentage, jarosite samples, with a thickness of only 

500  mm,  prevented  transmission.  This  result  is  extremely  important  for  the 

search  for  life  on  Mars  as:  a)  jarosite  typically  occurs  on  Earth  as  alteration 

crusts  and  patinas,  and  b)  a  very  thin  crust  of  jarosite  on  the  surface  of  Mars 

would be sufficient to shield microorganisms from UV radiation.

Over  the  last  half  century,  Mars  has  been  explored  with  telescopes, 

spacecrafts  and  robotic  rovers.  All  the  information  yielded  from  these  different 

sources,  along  with  the  results  obtained  by  the  study  of  SNC  meteorites  and 

terrestrial analogs, is starting to reveal the geological diversity of the planet and 

provides  data  for  theorizing  about  how  the  different  Martian  environments 

evolved.  However,  despite  the  huge  amount  of  geomorphological,  geodynamic 

and  geophysical  data  obtained,  much  is  still  unknown  about  Mars  mineralogy 

and paragenetic assemblages, which is fundamental to an understanding of its 

whole  geological  history.  Minerals  are  not  only  indicators  of  the  physical-

chemical settings of the different environments and their later changes, but also 

they  could  (and  can)  play  a  crucial  astrobiological  role  related  with  the 

possibility  of  existence  of  extinct  or  extant  Martian  life.  This  paper  aims:  1)  to 

emphasize  the  significance  of  Mars  minerals  as  environmental  geomarkers  for 

the  search  for  extraterrestrial  life  and  2)  to  present,  for  the  first  time,  a 

comparative  study  of  the  UV-shielding  properties  of  two  sulphate  minerals 

(jarosite  (KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6)  and  gypsum  (CaSO4.2H2O)).  Both  sulphates  were 

recently  found  to  exist  on  the  UV-radiation,  hostile  environmental  conditions  of 

the Mars surface and their formation was related with liquid water.

Information  from  scientific  literature  about  past  Mars  missions,  together 

with  recent  reviews  and  new  findings  (see  for  instance  Souza  et  al.  2004, 

3 

Mcsween 2004, Squyres and Knoll, 2005, Clark et al. 2005, Poulet et al. 2005) 

indicate 

that 

the  Mars  surface  environment 

is  dominated  by  minerals 

characteristic  of  mafic  igneous  rocks  (although  controversy  still  remains  about 

the  existence  of  andesite  versus  chemically  weathered  basalts).  Major  surface 

geological  units  of  the  ancient  crust consist  of pyroxenes and plagioclase, with 

varying  proportions  of  olivine  and  alteration  minerals.  Quartzofeldspathic 

materials also have been identified (Bandfield et al. 2004). The Martian regolith 

is  made  up  of  an  apparently  homogenized  dust  having  basaltic  composition, 

with  admixed  local  rock  components,  oxides,  water-bearing  phyllosilicates  and 

salts  (mainly  sulphates).  As  well,  Martian  (SNC)  meteorites  display  small 

amounts of secondary minerals (clays, carbonates, halides, sulphates) probably 

formed by reaction with subsurface fluids.  

(cid:3)

 

Unlike Earth, there is a significant amount of UV flux on Mars, mainly due 

to  the  influence  of  the  shorter  wavelengths  UVC  (100-280  nm)  and  UVB (280-

315 nm). Various works on the biological effects of UV radiation (Cockell, 1998, 

Cockell  et  al.  2000)  have  established(cid:3) that  even  the  present-day  instantaneous 

Martian UV flux would not in itself prevent life. Nevertheless, it is a fact that this 

UV  flux  contributes,  coupled  with  the  lack  of  liquid  water  and  extreme  low 

temperatures,  to  the  biologically  inhospitable  nature  of  the  Martian  surface. 

From  the  astrobiological  point  of  view,  these  factors  render  a  practical 

consequence  for  the  exploration  and  detection  of  life  on  Mars:  any  living 

organism,  as  we  know  it,  should  have  preferentially  developed  in  a  particular 

sub-surface microenvironment able to protect it from the harsh conditions on the 

surface.  Terrestrial  endolithic  communities  that  live  in  the  subsurface  layers  of 

4 

rock  that  provide  appropriate  microenvironments  against  extreme  external 

conditions  have  been  proposed  (Friedmann,  1982,  McKay,  1993,  Wynn-

Williams  and  Edwards,  2000,  Villar  et  al.  2005)  as  possible  analogs  to  life  on 

Mars.  Very  probably  no  place  on  Earth  is  truly  like  Mars.  Nevertheless,  it  is 

possible  to  define  potential  sites  on  our  planet  (Mars  analogs)  where 

environmental  conditions  (geology,  tectonics,  PLQHUDORJ\,  etc)  approximate,  in 

some specific way, those possibly encountered on Mars at present or earlier in 

that  planet’s  history.   Extant  Martian(cid:3) life  would  require  strong  UV  shielding, 

which,  in  accordance  with  the  results  here  presented,  could  be  perfectly 

accomplished by certain minerals already discovered on Mars.  

 

(cid:21)(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:3)0LQHUDOV(cid:3)DV(cid:3)HQYLURQPHQWDO(cid:3)JHRPDUNHUV(cid:3)

The search for life on Mars has been intimately linked to the identification 

of unequivocal ancient or modern geomarkers of water on and inside the planet. 

Recently, some water-related sulphates (e.g. jarosite, gypsum) were discovered 

(Squyres  et  al.  2004,  Klingelhöfer  et  al.  2004,  Langevin  et  al.  2005)  on  Mars 

surface.  In  particular,  jarosite  (Figure  1a)  has  proven  to  have  a  great 

astrobiological  importance,  not  only  for  its  relation  with  liquid  water,  but  also 

because  it  can  act  as  a  sink  and  source  of  Fe  ions  for  Fe-related 

chemolithoautotrophic  microorganisms,  such  as 

those  encountered 

in 

numerous  extremophilic  ecosystems (e.g. Tinto river (Lopez-Arcilla et al. 2001, 

Gonzalez-Toril et al. 2003, Amaral Zettler et al. 2003, Fernandez-Remolar et al. 

2004, 2005).

Jarosite  is  a  mineral  of  the  alunite-jarosite  family.  In  accordance  with 

Scott  (2000),  the  alunite–jarosite  minerals  are  defined  as  having  the  general 

formula AB3(XO4)2(OH)6, where A is a large ion in 12-fold coordination (e.g., K, 

Na,  Ca,  Pb,  REE),  B  is  usually Fe  or  Al,  and  the XO4 anions  are  usually  SO4, 

PO4 or AsO4. Gypsum, CaSO4.2H2O, is essentially a layered structure bound by 

hydrogen  bonds.  Zig-zag  chains  of  CaO8  polyhedra,  running  parallel  to  c,  are 

bound together by similar chains of isolated (SO4)2- tetrahedra, forming a double 

sheet perpendicular to (010). Each Ca2+ ion is surrounded by six oxygen atoms 

belonging  to  the  sulphate  groups  and  two  oxygen  atoms  belonging  to  the  H2O 

molecules.  These  H2O  molecules  form  a  layer  binding  the  polyhedral  sheets 

together  with  weak  hydrogen  bonds.  The  H2O  molecules  are  significantly 

distorted  and  are  oriented  such  that  the  hydrogen  bond  H2····O1  acts  almost 

entirely along b (Schofield et al. 1996). 

 

The  samples  of  jarosite  and  gypsum  used  in  this  work  come  from  two 

selected  areas  of  the  SE  Mediterranean  region  of  Spain:  Jaroso  and  Sorbas, 

which  have been  proposed  as a relevant geodynamic and mineralogical model 

(Martinez-Frias  et  al.  2001a,  2001b,  Martinez-Frias,  2004,  Rull  et  al.  2005)  to 

follow  for  the  astrobiological  exploration  of  Mars.  The  Jaroso  Hydrothermal 

System  is  a  volcanism-related  multistage  hydrothermal  episode  of  Upper 

Miocene  age,  which  includes  oxy-hydroxides  (e.g.  hematite),    base-  and 

precious-metal  sulfides  and  different  types  of  sulphosalts.  Hydrothermal  fluids 

and sulfuric acid weathering of the ores have generated huge amounts of oxide 

and sulfate minerals of which jarosite is the most abundant (Martinez-Frias et al. 

1992, Martinez-Frias, 1998).

It  is  important  to  note  that  jarosite  was  first  discovered  on  Earth  at  this 

area, in 1852, in the “Jaroso Ravine”, which is the world type locality of jarosite 

(Amar de la Torre, 1852, Martinez-Frias, 1999). The Sorbas basin contains one 

of  the  most  complete  sedimentary  successions  of  the  Mediterranean  (gypsum 

karst)  reflecting  the  increasing  salinity  during  the  Messinian  salinity  crisis 

(desiccation  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea)  (Martin  and  Braga,  1994,  Riding  et  al. 

1998,  Krijgsman  et  al.  1999)  and  showing  a  complex  paleogeographical 

evolution, being a signature of its progressive restriction and isolation.  

(cid:21)(cid:17)(cid:21)(cid:3)0DWHULDOV(cid:3)DQG(cid:3)PHWKRGV(cid:3)

Jarosite samples were pulverized and shaped by pressure into flat round 

pellets  of  1  cm  diameter  and  0.5  mm  thickness  (Figure  1b).  Gypsum  samples 

were scratched from a larger specimen. The samples were flattened to different 

thickness (between 0.1 mm to 1.6 mm) before exposed to UV light. All samples 

were  positioned  onto  a  sample  holder  which  allowed  the  UV  lamp  light  to  go 

through the samples and be detected by a PMT through a monochromator.  

The  UV  light  source is a Xe Lamp (SpectralProducts) with an integrated 

output  from  220  nm  to  500 nm  of  1.2  Wm-2  (measured  at  a  distance  of 10 cm 

from  the  lamp  exit  and  over  a  disc  of  5  mm  diameter).  A  monochromator 

(SpectralProducts, 1/8 m CM 110) is placed at the output of the lamp, but in our 

experiments it is set up so that it lets all wavelenghts out without deformation of 

the Xe lamp output. 5 cm downstream the light beam irradiates the sample, the 

 

7 

light  which  is  transmitted  through  it  is  then  collected  by  an  optical  fiber  head 

(placed 10 cm away from the Xe lamp), which in turns directs the light through 

through  a  spectrometer  (Bentham,  CM  150  double  monochromator)  which 

records the transmitted light spectrum. The light is detected by a peltier-cooled 

bi-alkali photomultiplier tube (PMT Bentham, DH-10-Te). Typically, each sample 

spectrum  is  measured  from  220  nm  to  500  nm  every  1nm  with  a  rate  of 

approximately 1 nm/s.  

 

Usually  each sample  spectrum  is the  average  of  at least 5 spectra. The 

mineralogical  and  chemical  composition  of  both  sulphates  was  previously 

verified by  XRD  (X-ray  diffraction),  scanning  electronic  microscopy (SEM-EDX) 

and ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry).  

 

 

 

 

(cid:22)(cid:17)(cid:3)5HVXOWV(cid:3)DQG(cid:3)FRQFOXVLRQ(cid:3)

It is well known that iron and iron-bearing compounds can provide an UV 

screen  for  life.  For  instance,  Martian  regolithic  dust,  along  with  palagonite-type 

compositions, have specifically been suggested as a possible safe haven for life 

(Sagan and Pollack, 1974, Olsen and Pierson, 1986, Pierson et al. 1993, Kumar 

et  al.  1996,  Allen  et  al.  1998,  Phoenix  et  al.  2001,  Gomez  et  al.  2003,  among 

others).  Our  experimental  results  demonstrate  a  large  difference  in  the  UV 

shielding  capabilities  of  both  sulphates (Figure  2).  Whereas  gypsum showed  a 

much  higher 

transmission  percentage  (with  an  error 

in  the  absorption 

coefficients of roughly 20%), jarosite samples, with a thickness of only 500 mm, 

8 

prevented transmission (Figure 2).  This has  great  astrobiological relevance as: 

a) jarosite typically occurs on Earth as alteration crusts and patinas (see figure 

1a),  and  b)  a  very  thin  crust  of  jarosite  on  the  surface  of  Mars  would  be 

sufficient to shield microorganisms from UV radiation.

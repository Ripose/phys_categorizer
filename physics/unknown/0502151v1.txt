Abstract:    The equation of the Doppler shift of two bodies in inertial motion in a reference frame at 

rest (i.e., stationary reference frame) is derived. The time delay of a moving clock, which is derived 

from the Lorentz transformation that depends on the velocity in the reference frame at rest, and the 

geometrical drawing are used to describe the longitudinal Doppler shift. We show that the equation 

of the Doppler shift depends on the velocities of the two bodies in the reference frame at rest.

1. Introduction   

Key  words:    Special  relativity,  reference  frame  at  rest,  longitudinal  Doppler  shift,  Lorentz 

In 1905, Einstein [1] pointed out that we do not need an absolute space frame defined by ether; 

however, he did not state that special relativity denies the existence of the absolute space frame. In 

1920  [2],  he  stated  that  special  relativity  does  not  deny  the  existence  of  ether,  and  declared  that 

general  relativity  requires  ether  [2].  We  consider  that  special  relativity  is  compatible  with  the 

absolute  space  frame,  in  that  Lorentz  invariance  does  not  require  modification  for adoption on  the 

absolute  space  frame.  On  the  basis  of  such  discussion,  we  refute  Einstein’s  1905  hypothesis; 

however,  the  discussion  is  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  the  special  relativity  theory.  A  tremendous 

amount of data concerning special relativity depends on Lorentz invariance; however, these data do 

not confirm or deny the existence of the absolute space frame; that is, the special relativity theory is 

not concerned with ether. Therefore, special relativity with ether can be considered. 

When  we  discuss  two  inertial  bodies  moving  with  relative  velocities,  one  of  which  is  in  a 

stationary state, the two equations of the Doppler shift are represented equivalently. However, if the

two bodies are moving in a reference frame at rest, the discussion of relativity that depends on the 

fact that “the clock of the other body looks delayed to each other” is insufficient. This discussion is 

ambiguous  and  a  more  precise  one  is  required.  We  show  the  equation  of  the  Doppler  shift  to 

eliminate such ambiguity.   

  In this paper, we show that the Doppler shift of light is derived from the geometrical drawing and 

the  Lorentz  transformation  of  the  reference  time.  Furthermore,  we  derive  the  equations  of  the 

longitudinal Doppler shift between two bodies moving relative to each other in a reference frame at 

rest.

B: Moving object B (rocket B)                                      tB 

  Figure  1  shows  the  refe-rence  frame  at  rest  (the  earth)  and  two  inertial  moving  objects,  (O:  the 

reference frame at rest (the earth), A: moving object A (rocket A) with the relative velocity vA, and 

B: moving object B (rocket B) with the relative velocity vB). We tentatively consider that the earth as 

a reference frame at rest. Of course, the earth travels in space relative to background radiation at a 

speed  of  380  km/s;  however,  this  speed  is  negligible  compared  with  the  speed  of  light  of  300,000 

km/s. The relative velocities vA and vB are defined in the reference frame at rest. Let the reference 

time  in  the  reference  frame  at  rest  be  t0;  the  reference  time  in  a  moving  frame  is  defined  by  the 

Lorentz transformation using t0. The reference time of object A is tA and that of object B is tB.

3. Derivation of longitudinal Doppler shift of light 

The  longitudinal  Doppler  shift  of  light  consists  of  the  Doppler  shift  of  sound  and  Lorentz 

transformation. The Doppler shift of sound f’ is derived from a geometrical drawing as represented 

by equation (3), v0 the velocity of the observer, vS that of the light source and fC a constant.

Where + and – indicate the direction of the relative motion of the light source and the observer, we 

should select + and – according to the relative motion between the light source and the detector. The 

frequencies are summarized in Table 1.

In Fig. 1, when the observer at rest (v0=0) on earth sees rocket 1 (the light source ) leaving, then + 

is  selected  to  decrease  the  frequency  according  to  vS.  And  vS  =  vA,  equation  (4)  is  derived  from 

equation (3) as

Then, we apply the Lorentz transformation. The Doppler shift frequency fC is derived as the inverse 

where f0 is the reference time of the reference frame at rest. By introducing equation (5) into fC in 

Equation (6) is the Doppler shift derived from the geometrical drawing and Lorentz transformation. 

The stationary observer sees the light source moving at the velocity vA.   

When the moving observer with velocity v0 sees the light source at rest, the geometrical drawing

is  represented  by  setting  vS=0  in  equation  (3),  and  considering  the  direction  of  movement  of  the 

observer we select –, and thus we obtain

The reference time of the moving observer becomes long according to the Lorentz transformation. 

Thus, the frequency of the light source that is seen by the moving observer increases. This is because 

the reference time of the moving observer decreases. Equation (7) is modified as

With  equations  (6)  and  (8),  we  show  that  the  equation  of  the  Doppler  shift  is  equivalent  for  the 

observer  and  the  light  source.  This  is  correct  when  either  the  observer  or  the  light  source  is 

  In equations (6) and (8), the sign of the velocity + or – should be considered; + velocity denotes 

that the distance between the observer and the light source increases, and – velocity denotes that the 

distance between the observer and the light source decreases. 

4. Derivation of Doppler shift equation of two moving bodies in reference frame at rest 

  Here, we discuss the relative motion of the two moving bodies in the reference frame at rest. The 

Doppler shift equations for between rocket A and rocket B are derived. When we see the clock in 

rocket B from rocket A using the clock in rocket A as reference. The observer is rocket A and the 

light source is rocket B, and the directions of the velocities of rockets A and B are chosen as shown 

in Fig. 1. Therefore the observer travels away from the light source and at the same time the light 

source travels towards the observer; thus we choose + in equation (3). The observer is rocket A and 

the light source is rocket B, then v0＝vA and vS＝vB, and thus, we obtain

Then, we carry out time conversion, that is, time modification using the reference times of rockets A 

and B. The reference times on rockets A and B are modified using the Lorentz transformation. When 

the observer in rocket A sees the time gain of the clock in rocket B, the reference time in rocket A of 

equation (1) is used.   

The frequency of the light source is the inverse of equation (2). Thus, when the observer in rocket 

A  sees  the  clock  in  rocket  B,  the  correction  constant  for  the  Doppler  shift  is  tA/tB.  Multiplying 

equation (10) by tA/tB we obtain,

  indicates the frequency at which the observer in rocket A sees the clock in rocket B. 

Equation (11) depends on vA, and vB, not on the relative velocity v=vA–vB.   

When the observer in rocket B sees the clock in rocket A, i.e., the observer is rocket B and the 

light source is rocket A; thus, the observer  moves away from  the light source and the light source 

moves towards the observer, we change vA and vB in equation (11) as

We consider equation (11); if we set vA = 0 we obtain the longitudinal Doppler shift of equation 

(6). If vB = 0, rocket A moves towards rocket B with the velocity vA. Under this condition we change 

the  sign  (+  and  –)  of  vA,  then  we  also  obtain  the  equation  of  longitudinal  Doppler  shift.  That  is, 

equation  (6)  is  valid  under  the  condition  that  either  the  observer  or  the  light  source  is  stationary. 

Under the condition vA = vB, that is the relative velocity is zero, the observers in both rockets see the 

same frequency f0, that is,

Now let us redraw Fig. 1. We now consider rocket A and reference frame at rest O from rocket B, 

as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  When  we  consider  reference  frame  at  rest  O,  we  can  apply  equation  (6). 

However, when we consider rocket A, equation (6) is not equal to equation (12). If we consider the 

reference frame in motion from another reference frame in motion, we have to adopt equation (11). 

If  we  consider  two  moving  objects,  the  representation  of  the  longitudinal  Doppler  shift  does  not

5. Discussion 

  We  discuss  the conditions under  which  equation  (6)  can  be  applied.  Figure  3  shows  the  velocity 

diagram of vA and vB. The velocities OA and OB show the light speed c. Therefore we discuss the 

conditions within the square C1C2C3C4. The lines A-A’ and B-B’ show that either the observer or the 

light source is stationary. The line C1-C3 shows that the relative velocity between the observer and 

the light source is zero. Under the conditions denoted by these three lines, we can use equation (6). 

At any arbitrary point in square C1C2C3C4, for example point D, we have to use equation (11). We 

could  show  that  there  are  conditions  where  the  Doppler  shifts  seen  by  the  observers  are  not 

equivalent to each other.   

  The  frequencies  we  have  discussed  are  relative  values,  that  is,  we  measure  the  frequencies  using 

our clocks on earth. We consider the earth as the reference frame at rest, because the velocity of the 

earth through in space relative to background radiation is 380 km/s, that is 0.13% of the light speed. 

6. Conclusion 

We showed that two bodies that are in inertial motion relative to a reference frame at rest see each 

other differently. Under such conditions, the equations of the Doppler shift depend on the absolute

velocities  of  the  moving  bodies.  The  time  delay  of  the  moving  clock  is  derived  from  the  Lorentz 

transformation that depends on the velocity of the moving clock in the reference frame at rest, that is, 

its absolute velocity. We prove that the two bodies are not equivalent on the basis of the equations of 

the Doppler shift.

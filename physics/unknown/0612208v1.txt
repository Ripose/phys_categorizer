 We present a method to realize active optical tips for use in near-field optics that can operate at room 

temperature.  A  metal-coated  optical  tip  is  covered  with  a  thin  polymer  layer  stained  with  CdSe 

nanocrystals or nanorods at low density. The time analysis of the emission rate and emission spectra of 

the active tips reveal that a very small number of particles - possibly down to only one - can be made 

active at the tip apex. This opens the way to near-field optics with a single inorganic nanoparticle as a

Current developments in aperture Near-Field Scanning Optical Microscopy (NSOM) include the search 

for  improved  spatial  resolution  in  the  nanometer  range  where  a  novel  optics  is  expected  to  emerge. 

Active  tips  made  of  a  fluorescent  nano-object  attached  to  a  regular  tip  [1]  have  much  to  offer  in  this 

context. Apart from challenging the ultimate resolution in optics, there are more fundamental stimuli  to 

this  research.  For  instance,  standard  electric-dipole  selection  rules  in  semiconductor  quantum  dots  are 

expected to be strongly affected by multipolar contributions at ultra-high spatial resolution [2]. This is 

especially true when the latter approaches typical length scales of the semiconductor material such as its 

exciton  Bohr  radius  [3].  In  addition,  a  point-like  source  of  light  attached  to  a  NSOM  aperture  tip  has 

been argued to be the ideal tool for mapping all details of the photonic Local Density-of-States (LDOS), 

which is a fundamental near-field property of a surface [4].  

A  major  breakthrough  towards  nanooptics  with  active  tips  has  been  realized  by  Michaelis  et  al.  [1] 

who have performed NSOM imaging with a single molecule serving as a point-like source of light that 

operates at low temperature. This pioneering work has been extended to other systems like color centers 

in  a  diamond  microcrystal  [5] and rare-earth doped glass micro-particles [6]. Recently, Shubeita et al. 

[7]  have  made  a  further  step  in  the  direction  of    active  tips  providing  high  spatial  resolution.  A  thin 

polymer layer with a large number (of the order of 1000) of CdSe nanocrystals (NCs) has been deposited 

on  coated  optical  tips.  These  active  tips have been used at 300 K for NSOM Fluorescence Resonance 

Energy  Transfer  (FRET)  imaging  of  single  dye  molecules.  An  optical  resolution  of  90  nm  has  been 

achieved.  However,  none  of  the  works  published  so  far  is  free  from  limitation  such  as  the  low-

temperature  operation  or/and  the  limited  spatial resolution due to the size of the supporting objects or 

number of active particles involved. 

In  this  letter,  we  describe  the  emission  properties  of  active  tips  made  of  a  few  CdSe  nanoparticles 

(NPs), either NCs or nanorods (NRs), deposited at the apex of a tapered and coated tip. Our goal is to 

make  photostable  light  nanosources  working  at  room  temperature  and  potentially  able  to  offer  optical 

resolution in the sub-10 nm range. Semiconductor NPs have a large potential in this respect because they 
2 

 

have  natural  small  dimensions,  their  optical  properties  are  size-tunable,  they  possess  an  absorption 

threshold  -  rather  than  absorption  bands  as  dye  molecules  –  they  are  optically  active  at  room 

temperature, and they are more photostable (little bleaching) than single molecules [8] . 

ZnSe capped CdSe NCs have been synthesized following the procedure of Reiss et al. [9] . The used 

core NCs have a diameter of 3.8 nm. After growing a ZnSe shell of approximately 1 nm thickness on 

their  surface,  the  resulting  CdSe/ZnSe  core/shell  NCs  exhibit  a  room-temperature  photoluminescence 

(PL) quantum yield of ca. 70% in chloroform and a size dispersion < 10 %. With the goal to improve 

their stability against photo-oxidation, the surface of the CdSe/ZnSe NCs has been functionalized with 

tridecanedithioic acid [10]. Recently, several advances in the synthesis of colloidal semiconductor NCs 

have been made, allowing for size and shape control [11,12]. Of particular interest in this context is the 

possibility to obtain quantum confined CdSe NRs with a narrow distribution of length and diameter. The 

NRs  [12]  used  in  this  work  have  a  diameter  of  3.9  nm  and  a  length  of  13  nm  and  are  coated  with  a 

ZnSe/ZnS double shell. The intermediate ZnSe shell provides strain relaxation at the interface between 

the CdSe core and the outer ZnS shell [13], in a similar manner as in the CdSe/CdS/ZnS system [14]. 

After shell growth, the NRs have a diameter of 4.4 nm and a length of 21.5 nm (aspect ratio 4.9).  

Before depositing a small number of CdSe NPs at the optical tip apex, it is necessary to characterize 

their  emission  properties  in  a  more  conventional  environment.  This  is  done  at  room  temperature  (all 

measurements  presented  in  this  paper  are  performed  at  room  temperature)  by  means  of  scanning 

confocal  microscopy  of  a  polymer  (PMMA)  film  containing  CdSe NPs. Samples are prepared by spin 

coating the film onto a glass cover slip. CdSe NPs are excited with the 458 nm spectral line of a cw Ar+ 

laser  through  a  X100  infinity-corrected  objective  (NA=1.3).  The  PL  signal,  which  is  selected  in  the 

spectral window 540-620 nm with suitable optical filtering, is collected via the same objective. 

A  first  series  of  measurements  consists  in  detecting  this  PL  signal  by  an  avalanche  photodiode  in 

photon counting mode. PL images are then acquired by raster scanning the sample through the excitation 

spot of the microscope. Four fluorescence images of CdSe-NPs doped PMMA film are shown in Figure 

1. The typical blinking behavior [15,16] of several isolated objects can be clearly observed both for NCs 

3 

 

and NRs. The "off" periods of the PL emission can be seen as horizontal dark stripes in some of the PL 

spots. As a consequence of this blinking, the images are only partly acquired. Nevertheless, up to four 

individual NCs can be distinguished in Figure 1a and Figure 1b, with possibly a very weak fifth one in 

the lower left corner, whereas presumably only one NR is seen on each image of Figure 1c and Figure 

1d.  Although  not  elucidated  so  far  [17],  the  PL  intermittency  phenomenon  is  commonly  attributed  to 

electron  (or  hole)  ejection  via  an  Auger  process  [15],  which  leaves  a  charged  particle  switching  the 

nanocrystal  in  a  "dark"  state:  other  photogenerated  electron-hole  pairs  will  recombine  non-radiatively 

until the excess charge leaves the nanocrystal. 

In Figure 2a, respectively Figure 2b, the PL intensity is plotted as a function of time for NCs and NRs, 

respectively. Here, scanning has been stopped, in such a way that the laser spot is focused on a single 

NP previously isolated in a PL image similar to those of Figure 1. It is clearly seen that the single NPs 

alternate  "on"  and  "off"  periods  with  some  "off"  having  duration  in  excess  of  100  s.  Although  this 

blinking can raise problems in some applications, it turns out to be an advantage here because it helps us 

to evaluate the number of active NPs at the apex of the optical tip as described later in the paper. Indeed, 

isolated  particles  blink  in  a  discrete  manner  as  shown in Figure 1, Figure 2a and Figure 2b whereas a 

large ensemble of NCs does not exhibit such a behavior. This is because individuals of a large ensemble 

are not synchronized and an average behavior is revealed. 

A  second  characterization  consists  in  spectrally  analyzing  the  filtered  PL  signal  by  means  of  a 

spectrometer  equipped  with  a  cooled  charged-coupled  device.  Figure  2c,  respectively  Figure  2d, 

compares spectra of a single CdSe NC, respectively NR, with spectra of the corresponding ensemble. In 

both  cases,  single  NPs  have  gaussian  spectra  that  are  substantially  narrower  -  typically  20  nm  in  the 

wavelength domain - than the ensemble. The full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the ensemble is 35 

nm for NCs and even 40 nm for NRs, respectively. This reflects the size dispersion of NPs. In principle, 

the blinking behavior of single NPs should also manifest itself in the spectra (see below), but the large 

integration  time  of  5  minutes  required  to  have  sizable  signal  strength  in  our  confocal  spectrometer 

hindered  such  an  observation.  The  behavior  observed  here  in  both  the  PL  time  traces  (i.e.  discrete 

4 

 

blinking)  and  PL  spectra  (rather  narrow  spectra)  of  single  NPs  serves  as  a  valuable  reference  for 

characterizing them when located at the apex of an optical tip as described in the next section. 

Since  the  fluorescence  signals  emitted  by  a  few  NPs  attached  to  an  optical  tip  are  expected  to  have 

very low intensity, it is most important to start with substrate tips delivering an extremely low parasitic 

fluorescence  signal.  Our  tips  have  been  prepared  by  a  special  chemical-etching  process  of  pure  silica 

optical fibers and they have been subsequently coated with aluminum. They offer a free optical aperture 

at the apex in the 150 nm range and a large transmission of the order of 10-2. Details of their fabrication 

procedure and of their optical properties will be given elsewhere. CdSe single-NP-based active optical 

tips are prepared in the same manner as Shubeita et al. [7] but with a very small number of CdSe NPs on 

the active area of the tip. Initial solutions of CdSe/ZnSe NCs (respectively NRs) in chloroform with a 

concentration of 5 mg/ml (respectively 10 mg/mL) are used. These solutions are manifold diluted (2500 

for NCs, 12500 for NPs) and are then mixed with a PMMA polymer in order to obtain  2 % in-weight 

PMMA solutions. The metal-coated fiber probe is briefly dipped into, and then withdrawn from, one of 

these solutions. After evaporation of the solvent, a thin PMMA layer stained with CdSe NPs is formed 

at the tip apex (Figure 3). An analysis by scanning electron microscopy confirms that the thickness of 

the layer is well below 100 nm although it is not possible to give a more quantitative figure at this stage. 

The laser beam at 458 nm is coupled to the cleaved end of the fiber probe and the PL signal is collected 

with  a  microscope  objective  (X60,  NA=  0,75).  Appropriate  optical  filters  are  arranged  in  front  of  the 

detector to restrict the relevant spectral range to 540-620 nm. As for the test samples, the PL emitted by 

the  active  probe  is  either analyzed through its time evolution or spectrally dispersed. A scheme of the 

experimental set-up is given on Figure 3. 

The four successive time traces shown in Figure 4a, respectively Figure 4b, reveal a clear switching 

between  "on-like"  and  "off-like"  intensities  for  NCs,  respectively  NRs.  This  mimics  the  behavior  of 

single NPs in a PMMA film described above. This is a strong indication that the number of active NPs 

involved is certainly of the order of a few units only. This number goes down to zero over some periods 

of  time  since  the  "off"  intensity  matches  the  small  background  fluorescence  of  the  substrate  tip.  This 

5 

 

behavior is very clear for NCs (Figure 4a) but is less marked for the optical tip stained with NRs (Figure 

4b)  which  showed  an  unusual  strong  background  fluorescence  already  prior  to  depositing  the  thin 

PMMA  layer.  This  is  possibly  due  to  undesired  pollution  at  the  tip  apex.  Therefore,  in  the  rest  of  the 

letter,  we  will  discuss  in  more  detail  the  CdSe-NCs  based  tip  only,  although  NRs  give  very  similar 

results. 

The trend, suggested by the time traces of Figure 4a, that only a few NCs contribute to the PL signal is 

confirmed by the spectral analysis of  Figure 5a which shows in a (time,wavelength) plane 42 successive 

spectra of the PL emitted by the active tip. Each spectrum has been collected over 30 s, fitted by a multi-

peak gaussian curve, and normalized. The PL intensity is represented with a stretched false color in the 

(time, wavelength) plane. Clearly, several periods without PL emission at all (red) can be seen, e.g., at 

around 200 s, 400 s, and 1200 s along the time axis. This corresponds to an "off" state extending at least 

over 30 s. In addition, it can be seen that the emission wavelength(s) change(s) dramatically with time 

during the "on" periods. This manifests itself in Figure 5a as large shifts in peak positions (purple) along 

the  wavelength  axis.  This  is  due  to  a  combination  of  a  change  in  time  of  the  number  of  NCs  being 

actually  active  and  of  possible  spectral  diffusions  of  individual  NCs  [18].  An  interesting  subsidiary 

finding in our experiments is that not all of the CdSe nano-emitters are quenched at the tip apex despite 

the proximity of the aluminum coating, see Figure 3. 

Figure 5b is a selection of a few spectra taken from the above series that confirms that the PL spectra 

change  dramatically  with  time.  The  spectrum  at  the  middle  (bottom)  shows  two  (one)  peak(s)  with  a 

fwhm  of  the  order  of  15  to  20  nm  similar  to  that  shown  in  Figure  2c  for  a  single  NC.  The  upper 

spectrum  does  not  show  any  PL  at  all  which  suggests  that  all  of  the  NCs  have  turned  off  during  the 

collection of this spectrum, in agreement with the red lines seen in Figure 5a. Again this is reminiscent 

of  the  blinking  behavior  observed  for  single  NCs  dispersed  in  a  PMMA  film.  Due  to  the  limited 

integration  time  of  30  s,  it  is  indeed  possible  here  to  observe  the  blinking  in  the  spectral  domain  in 

contrast with Figure 2c (integration time ten times longer). 

 

6 

As a complementary test, similar measurements have been done on an active tip stained with a high 

concentration  of  CdSe/ZnSe  NCs.  In  Figure  6,  no  blinking  is  observed  neither  in  time  traces  nor  in 

spectra. These observations give strong indication that only a few NCs contribute to the PL of the active 

tip in Figure 4a and Figure 5. 

In  summary,  a  method  for  elaborating  CdSe  NPs-based  active  NSOM  tips  operating  at  room 

temperature has been described. Both the spectral and temporal behavior of the active tips confirm that 

only a limited number of NPs, either NCs or NRs, are actually active at the tip apex. This opens the way 

to  near-field  optics  using  a  single  semiconductor  NP  as  light  source  -  a  nanosystem  potentially  much 

more  photostable  than  a  single  molecule.  An  obvious  on-going  extension  of  the  present  work  is  to 

perform NSOM imaging of test surfaces using these active tips.

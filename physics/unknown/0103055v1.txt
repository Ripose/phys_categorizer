The  study  presented  here  was  initiated  by  a  discussion  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  using 

synchrotron radiation as a source for the Next Generation Lithography (NGL) based on the EUV-

concept  (Extreme  Ultra-Violet;  here  13.5  nm  or  11.3  nm  radiation,  respectively).  The 

requirements are: 50 W, 2% bandwidth and minimal power outside this bandwidth. Three options 

were  investigated.  The  first  two  deal  with  radiation  from  bending  magnets  and  undulators.  The 

results confirm the earlier work by Oxfords Instrument and others that these light-sources lack in-

band  power  while  emitting  excessive  out-of-band  radiation.  The  third  approach  is  a  FEL  (Free 

Electron Laser) driven by a 500 MeV linear accelerator with a superconducting mini-undulator as 

radiation  emitting  device.  Such  a  device  would  produce  in-band  EUV-power  in  excess  of 50 W 

with negligible out-of-band power.

1.  Introduction 

 

Lithography, the technique for manufacturing microelectronic semiconductor devices such as 

processors  or  memory  chips,  presently  uses  deep  UV  (DUV)  radiation.  The  main  radiation 

source is the 193 nm line of an ArF excimer laser [1]. Future sources will be   F2 lasers at a 

wavelength of 157 nm and eventually H2 lasers at a wavelength of 127 nm. 

In addition, advanced lithography technologies (Next Generation of Lithography: NGL) based 

on  EUV,  X-ray  photons,  electrons,  and  ions  are  being  investigated  by  chip  makers  and 

equipment manufacturers.  

The  competing  technologies  are:  SCALPEL  electron  lithography  (Scattering  with  Angular 

Limitation in Projection Electron-Beam Lithography) [2], Ion Projection Lithography [3], X-

ray  Proximity  Lithography  [4]  and  Extreme  UV  Lithography  [5].  The  latter  is  being 

considered as one of the most promising. In the US a program to develop this technology was 

set  up  as  early  as  in  1994  by  the  EUV  LLC  (Limited  Liability  Corporation)  in  cooperation 

with  the  VNL  (Virtual  National  Lab).  Members  of  VNL  are  LLNL  (Lawrence  Livermore 

National Lab), LBNL (Lawrence  Berkeley National Lab) and Sandia National Lab. In Japan 

the ASET consortium was funded (Association of Super-Advanced Electronics Technologies) 

During  the  research  phase  the  needs  for  a  EUV  source  suitable  for  future  production  lines 

were identified. The main requirements are: 

Wavelength: 13.5 nm (=92 eV)  or 11.3 nm 

                                                                          Page 3 of 32 

 

Bandwidth: 2% 

Output power: 25 W (first step) and later 50 W 

In addition, the power radiated outside this band has to be less than 500 W to avoid thermal 

problems on the optics. The development of a suitable source is one of the big challenges in 

Basically, powerful sources of EUV photons may be based on either plasmas [7] (produced by 

laser  irradiation  of  matter  or  by  gas  discharges)  or  on  relativistic  electrons  (synchrotron 

EUV lithography.  

radiation).  

In  Europe,  the  development  of  synchrotron  radiation-based  EUV  sources  [8]  was  partly 

supported  by  the  European  Union  within  the  framework  of  the  EUCLIDES  program  [9]. 

Similar investigations  were  performed  in Japan  [10]  and the  USA [11]. The studies showed  

that  conventional  storage  rings  with  and  without  additional  magnets  (normal  conducting  or 

superconductive  wigglers  or  undulators)  do not  fulfil  all  the above-mentioned specifications 

for the EUV source. 

The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research initiated at the beginning of 2000 a 

program  on  plasmas  generated  by  lasers  or  gas  discharges  as  sources  of  EUV  light  for  the 

next generation lithography (NGL). In the initial phase of this project it was felt that  sources 

based on synchrotron radiation should be reconsidered. In the first quarter of 2000 the authors 

presented their report. The present paper is a shortened version of this report.  The result was 

that among all possible sources based on synchrotron radiation only a Free Electron Laser can 

meet  the  above  mentioned  stringent  requirements  at  13.5  nm.  In  summer  2000  a  group  at 

DESY published independently a paper in which the design  of a SASE Free Electron Laser 

source for lithography at 70 nm is described [33 ] confirming at least in principle the viability 

of the FEL concept.

2. Incoherent radiation from the storage rings 

In  the  following  the  results  already  obtained  in  the  EUCLIDES  study  are  summarized  for 

reference.  A  model  storage  ring  is  shown  in  fig.1.  The  parameters  which  are  needed  to 

calculate the emitted  photon intensity at 13.5 nm within the required bandwidth of 2% are 

-    electron energy  

–  magnetic field strength  

– 

electron current  

The maximum storable current depends on two limitations: beam instabilities and intrabeam 

scattering  (Touschek-Effect)  [12].  Beam  instabilities  can  be  defeated  by  feedback  systems. 

The Touschek lifetime for an unpolarized beam is approximately

where re = 2,8.10-15 m (classical electron radius). N is the number of particles per bunch. 

Assuming a 500 MHz RF frequency N is equal to 1,25.1010 for a stored beam of 1 A. γ is the 

ratio between energy and rest energy. 

The rest of the parameters describes the particle density in relation to the region in which the 

particles are stable, the so-called energy acceptance. 

εacc is the energy acceptance of the storage ring. A particle gets lost when the scattering is so 

violent  that  a  particle  changes  its  energy    by  more  than  that.  The  scattering  probability 

depends on the density of the particles in the bunch. The parameter ζ = (εacc/γσ´x)2. σ´x is the 

divergence in the beam.  

For ζ ≤ 10-2 the following approximation is valid C(ζ) ≅ -ln(1,732ζ)-1.5. The bunch volume 

V is 8 π3/2σxσyσL. Typical Touschek life times for a 1 A beam are summarized in Table I. 

                                                                          Page 5 of 32 

 

The  strong  dependence  of  the  Touschek  effect  on  the  energy  indicates  that  the  preferred 

storage rings are operating at higher energies: 0.3 GeV and higher.  

The  spectral  power  ∆P  of  the  emitted  synchrotron  radiation  in  Watts  per  eV,  per  mrad 

horizontal angle ϑ and integrated over the vertical angle is given by  formula (2) [12], [13].

Figs. 2 and 3 show the results of equation (4). The assumed current is 1 A in all cases.  

In conclusion it can be said that for ca. 100 eV photons the spectral density has a maximum at 

fields near 1.5 to 2 T.  It follows from fig. 3 that the spectral power increases the higher the 

energy  is.  The  optimum  values  can  be  reached  with  room  temperature  magnets  (1.5  T)  and 

high energies (in other words with fairly large machines).  

                                                                          Page 6 of 32 

 

The maximum angle over which photons can be collected is 6.28 rad (the full circumference 

of the storage ring). The maximum in-band power as a function of energy and field strength is 

shown in fig. 4 for a stored beam of 1A. Fig. 5 shows 2 D cuts of figure 4. 

From these curves it is obvious that the 50 W requirement with a stored beam of 1 A can only 

be met at energies significantly above 1 GeV. The maximum collectible power at an energy of 

0.6 GeV is 27 W. This in-band power has to be compared with the total radiated power: 

                                     PT[kW] = 88.5 

                                                            (5)

power P/total power PT) is

The  power  ratio  is  shown  in  fig.  6.  The  maximum  values  are  obtained  at  low  fields.  This 

argument  confirms  that  high  beam  energy  and  low  magnetic  fields  are  the  optimum 

parameters.  A  storage  ring  of  0.6  GeV  and  a  field  of  1.5  T  might  be  a  fair  compromise  to 

obtain a total in-band power of more than 25 W.  

It is obvious all the formulas mentioned in the previous chapter valid for bending magnets are 

also valid for wigglers. The wiggler has  two advantages  over a  bending  magnet. Firstly, the 

photons  are  emitted  into  a  cone  centred  around  the  direction  of  motion  of  the  beam.  The 

collection  of  photons  is  easier  with  a  wiggler  than  with  a  bending  magnet.  Secondly,  since 

there is no net deflection, it is easier to choose the optimum field. 

Wigglers with a small maximum beam deflection angle α are called undulators. The K-value 

is defined in the following way: 

                                                                          Page 7 of 32

A measured spectrum of the first harmonics of an undulator depending on the angle is shown 

in fig. 7. In fig. 7 angle and photon energy are clearly related (depending on the emittance of 

the beam). This is described by (8) [28].  

The undulator condition (8) has to be fulfilled for 13.5 nm. This condition limits the number 

of  possible  solutions  for  the  period  length.  In  addition,  a  general  rule  states  that  the  period 

length  should  not  be  shorter  than  4  times  the  gap  width  of  the  undulator.  If  this  rule  is  not 

observed, than the field acting on the beam becomes too small [14]. 

The formula used in Table I for the total power radiated from an undulator is  
 

                                  P[W] = 

                                                             (9)

Nu is the number of periods. The calculated in-band power for an undulator is shown (as an 

example)  in  fig.  8.  The  parameters  of  different  undulators  are  summarized  in  Table  II.  The 

first harmonics of all undulators is close to 13.5 nm. 

 
Despite the fact that the maximum obtainable power does not fulfil the stringent requirement  

the undulator has clear advantages over wigglers.  

The  K-values  in  Table  I  are  in  the  order  of  1  to  2.  According  to  formula  (7)  the  magnetic 

fields of the undulator are larger than 1 T.  These values are larger than those achieved with 

conventional  permanent  magnet  undulators.  In  Brookhaven  [15]  and  Karlsruhe  [16] 

independent concepts for using superconductors rather than arrays of permanent magnets have 

                                                                          Page 8 of 32 

 

been under discussion. Recently Karlsruhe together with a group at Mainz [20] have been able 

to demonstrate the viability of such a  concept under normal beam conditions. Fig. 7 shows 

the measured spectrum from these experiments. 

Fig.  9  shows  the  principle  of  a  superconductive  undulator.  The  field  is  generated  by  a 

superconductive  wire  in  an  iron  matrix  (darker parts in fig. 9).  The superconductive  wires 

are close to the beam. The undulator is indirectly cooled by liquid helium not shown in figure 

9. The parameters for this specific undulator are: period length 14 mm and  K=2 (1.5 T) [30]. 

The calculated undulator field is shown in fig. 10. 

                        
 
 
3. The Free Electron Laser approach 
 
 
It has been shown in the previous chapters that the specifications for the source defined in the 

introduction, 50 W within a 2 % bandwidth at 13.5 nm, is barely achievable to obtain with a 

conventional synchrotron radiation source. 

In  1951  Motz  was  the  first  to  point  out  that  the  intensity  of  a  photon  beam  emitted  by 

electrons  can  be  increased  by  coherent  superposition  [18].  The  logic  is  as  follows.  If  each 

electron emits a photon the resulting electric field Etotal is: 

                                                     

                                                                            (10)

En is the electric field of the individual photons.  The intensity is proportional to E2

the phases of the photons have a random distribution (incoherent light) the cross terms cancel 

and the averaged sum is 

                                                   I  =

When  the  phases  of  the  electrons  are  identically  and  they  are  not  randomly  distributed  the 

cross-terms do not disappear and the intensity is N2  times the intensity of a single electron. 

This is obviously the case when the electrons are concentrated in bunches. The length of these 

bunches (so-called micro-bunches) must be smaller than the wavelength. The micro-bunches 

are  separated by a multiple of a wavelength.   

If  this  argument  is  turned  around,  then  most  of  the  intensity  of  a  conventional  synchrotron  

radiation  source  is  destroyed  by  incoherence  or,  if  expressed  in  other  terms,  by  the  random 

distances of the emitting electrons. When the electrons have distances which are smaller than 

the emitted light wave the intensity can be  increased by an enormous factor (N is a very big 

number). 

Since 1951 this principle has been experimentally investigated with great success by various 

groups  and  this  has  changed  dramatically  the  design  of  synchrotron  light  sources  [19],  [20] 

and beam diagnostics tools [21].

In  order  to  operate  a  FEL  effectively  the  following  conditions  on  the  emittance  have  to  be 

a.)  Particles  with  an  angle  to the  beam axis   do  not  fulfil the  resonance  condition    (8). The 

electron velocity in the direction of the axis is changed by  –x´2/2 ( x´ is the angle relative 

to  the  axis).  In  order  to  keep  the  electron  within  a  half-wave  over  the  whole  undulator 

length, the condition

      has to be fulfilled, where L is the length of the undulator [31] .

Equation (14) requires that the horizontal and vertical emittance of the beam has to be smaller 

than 1.07 nm. In a linac the emittance shrinks with energy (adiabatic damping)

depends on the gun. For a photo-cathode gun εn is close to 10-6 m.rad (depending on current, 

bunch  length  etc.)  [23].  Following  equation  (15)  γ  has  to  be  1000  or  higher  (linac  energy 

equal or above 500 MeV). Assuming a gradient of 20 MeV/m, the linac is 27.5 m (or close to 

30 m) long. For 0.52 GeV and K = 1.4 the period length of the undulator is 1.43 cm according 

to equation  (8). The peak field is circa 1.05 T  according to equation (7). Linacs with more 

than 40 MeV/m are available, so that the minimum length of the linac is about 15 m. 

 
The SASE FEL [32] is generally described by analytical methods. The fundamental parameter 

in this description is the gain length LG, the   length in which the FEL  power increases by a 

factor  of  e.  The  gain  length  depends  on  the  power  density  of  the  emitted  light.  The  power 

density is a function of the undulator properties (K-value, period length), the beam properties 

(peak  current,  energy,  β-functions,  emittance,  energy  spread  etc.)  and  the  properties  of  the 

optical  beam  (diffraction).  In  order  to  separate  the  different  influences  the  following 

parameters are introduced:  

                                                                          Page 11 of 32

The  Pierce  parameter  describes  the  emission  of  synchrotron  radiation.  IA  is  17  kA  (Alven 

current)  and  the  rest  of  the  parameters  are  explained  in  previous  equations.  χ  and  S  are 

correction parameters describing the influence of the diffraction and the energy spread.  

The diffraction effects are described by the parameter S in (16):

and produce the curve shown in fig. 11 [24]. The curve has a minimum close to a beta of 0.3 

m with a slight slope towards higher beta-functions.  

A  beta  function  of  2  m  throughout  the  whole  undulator  is  an  acceptable  compromise.  The 

undulator shown in fig. 9 has to be modified in such a way that it focuses in both directions. 

The focusing in both directions in an undulator with permanent magnets was demonstrated at 

DESY  for  the  first  time  [35].  A  similar  effect  can  be  achieved  for  the  superconductive 

undulator  either  by    shaping  the  iron  poles  in  an  appropriate  way.  A  study  on  SASE  and 

superconductive undulators can be found in [26]. 

Up to now the influence of the energy spread was not taken into account. The energy spread 

leads to a broadening of the laser line and finally to a loss of gain. The influence of the energy 

spread is described by the function χ in a complex way.  χ is determined by three parameters: 

 

 

 

                                                                          Page 12 of 32

All 3 parameters depend on β and on the energy spread σε. The parameters have to fulfil an 

integral equation and a solution is only possible by numerical techniques. The function 

(βχ

χ depends somewhat on  β but strongly on the energy spread.  

The FEL process starts from the radiation emitted in the first gain length of the undulator. The 

number N of undulator periods in the first gain length (equation (16)) is

The dependence  of  the  peak power on the undulator length is shown for two cases  (energy 

spread of 10-4 and an energy spread of  5.10-4)  in figs. 12 and 13. The peak current Ipeak is 200 

A. Obviously, the final peak power is the same in both cases. The energy spread only defines 

the length of the undulator [27].  

The peak power of one pulse is ca. 1.33. 108 W.  One pulse with an assumed bunch length of 

3 psec produces an energy of π2 .3.10-12 1.33 108 J or about 1 mJ. In order to produce a cw 

power of 50 W, a pulse repetition rate of 50 kHz is required. 

The  required  average  current  is  fairly  modest.  Working  on  the  basis  of  a  1.5  GHz  linac  RF 

system (bucket repetition of time of 0.67 nsec) the average current is  

                                       200(3/667)(5.104/1,5.109) A = 30µA.

4.  Possible Layout of the FEL source 

 

A possible layout of the EUV laser system for a wafer fab is shown in fig. 14. It is assumed 

that the EUV source (linac, undulator etc.) will be located  in the basement of the factory. The 

EUV  radiation  enters  the  clean  room  via  evacuated pipes which come up through the floor. 

The  normalized  emittance  of  the  beam  (assumed    to  be10-6)  determines  the  energy  of  the 

linac: 500 MeV.  

(Cu-cavities). 

The accelerating structures can be either superconductive (Nb-cavities) or normal conducting 

Normal conductive cavities allow simple and short structures: energy gains of up 40 MeV/m 

and higher are possible. The length of the  linac would be less than 15 m.  

The accelerating gradient for superconductive linacs is at the moment ≥20 MeV/m and, as a 

result, a superconducting linac will be almost twice as long as a room temperature linac.  

The  accelerated  beam  is  directly  sent  to  a  11m  long  SASE  undulator.  All  bends  along  the 

trajectory have to be isochronous in order to prevent bunch lengthening. 

The  installation  of  most  of  the  equipment  in  auxiliary  and/or  distant  rooms,  such  as  the 

basement is an integral part of the following layout considerations. Fig. 14 shows one possible 

way  of  distributing  the  EUV  light.  A  central  linac  provides  a  distributed  undulator  system 

with  an  electron  beam.  The  beam  is  switched  by  magnets  to  the  undulators.  The  fact  that 

several SASE superconducting undulators are fed from one linac reduces the capital cost per 

stepper.  

Conclusion 

 
The  German  Federal  Ministry  of  Education  and  Research  initiated  a  program  on  plasmas 

generated by lasers or gas discharges as sources of EUV light (50 W at 13.5 nm, bandwidth 

2%) for the next generation lithography (NGL). In the initial phase of this project it was felt 

                                                                          Page 15 of 32 

 

that  sources based on synchrotron radiation should be reconsidered. The aim of this  report is 

to investigate such sources.   

The  report  starts  with  investigations  into  the  emitted  power  of  small  storage  rings  with 

energies  of  less  than  0.6  GeV.  The  total  emitted  power  collected  over  the  entire  

circumference is less than 50 W (stored current of 1 A).  

In  a  next  step  storage  rings  were  equipped  with  wigglers.  It  is  easier  to  collect  the  wiggler 

radiation but the conclusions are similar: the total emitted power is insufficient. 

In  the  following  step  storage  rings  with  undulators  have  been  studied.  Under  certain 

circumstances these devices have clear advantages over the wiggler system. In undulators the 

emitted photons can interfere coherently. This fact makes it possible to amplify the intensity 

within the required bandwidth and minimize it outside. In order to optimise the output power, 

superconducting mini-undulators are required.  

Free  Electron  Lasers  (FELs)  consisting  of  linacs  and  undulators  produce  light  with  a  high 

degree of coherence and of high power. Unwanted out-of-band-radiation is almost completely 

eliminated.  The  study  shows  that  the  so-called  SASE  technique  (Self  Amplified  Stimulated 

Emission)  can  easily  produce    the  required  EUV  power.  The  SASE  effect  was  already 

observed experimentally at wavelengths as low as 80 nm. 

As  a  result,  synchrotron  radiation  (mainly  FELs)  can  easily  fulfil  the  stringent  requirements 

for  the  Next  Generation  of  Lithography  based  on  EUV  when  suficet  space  is  forseen  in  a 

wafer fab.

Abstract 

         Recently published formulas for the surface and regular solid spherical harmonics and for 

the  expansion  of  the  product  of  two  normalized  associated  Legendre  functions  with  different 

centers in ellipsoidal coordinates (Telhat Özdoğan, Metin Orbay, Czech.J.Phys., 52(2002)1297) 

are  critically  analyzed.  It  is  demonstrated  that  the  presented  in  this  work  formulas  are  not 

original and they are available in the literature or can easily be obtained from the published in 

the literature formulas by changing the summation indices.   

PACS: 02.70.-c, 31.15.-p, 31.20.Ej 

Key words: surface spherical harmonics, regular solid spherical harmonics, normalized  

                     associated Legendre functions, multicenter integrals.

      Özdoğan and Orbay in Ref.[1] published the cartesian expressions for surface and regular 

spherical harmonics and the expansion formulas for the product of two normalized associated 

Legendre functions both with different centers in ellipsoidal coordinates. Eqs.(14),(15), (16), 

(21), (22), (23) and (27), (28) presented in Ref.[1] by these authors have been already given in 

Refs.[2] and [3], respectively: 

Eqs.(5.4.4), (5.4.5) and (5.4.6) in Ref.[2]

      It is easy to show that Eqs.(7),(11),(13),(17) and (18) of Ref.[1] for cartesian expressions 

os  SSH  and  RSSH  can  be  derived  from  the  published  in  Ref.[2]  formulas  by  changing  the 

summation indices:

    The  published  in  Ref.[1]  Eqs.[24]  and  (25)  for  the  expansion  of  the  product  of  two 

normalized  associated  Legendre  functions  in  ellipsoidal  coordinates  and  their  use  in  the 

evaluation of multicenter integrals over STOs were  critically analyzed in our Comment [4]. 

We  have  proved  that  Eqs.(24)  and  (25)  of  Ref.[1]  are  obtained  from  the  expansion 

relationships contained in our articles [3,5,6] by changing the summation indices. 

    Thus, the formulas published by Özdoğan and Orbay for cartesian expressions for surface 

and  regular  solid  spherical  harmonics  and  for  expansion  of  the  product  of  normalized 

associated Legendre functions in ellipsoidal coordinates are not original and they are available 

in the literature.

Abstract 

In  this  work  2D  Ising  systems  were  used  to  simulate  the  reversals  of  the 

Earth’s magnetic field. Each spin was supposed to be one ring current in the Earth 

dynamo  and  the  magnetization  was  supposed  to  be  proportional  to  the  field 

intensity.  Given  the  relative  success  of  some  physical  few-discs  modeling  of  this 

system all the simulations were implemented in small system. The temperature T 

was used as a tuning parameter. It plays the role of external perturbations. Power 

laws  were  obtained  for  the  distribution  of  times  between  reversals.  When  the 

system  size  was  increased  the  exponent  of  the  power  law  asymptotically  tended 

towards  values  very  near  –1.5,  generally  accepted  as  the  right  value  for  this 

phenomenon.  Depending  on  the  proximity  of  T  and  TC  the  average  duration  of 

reversal periods changes. In this way it is possible to establish a parallel between 

the  model  and  more  or  less  well  defined  periods  of  the  reversal  record.  Some 

possible trends for future works are advanced.

1. Introduction 

The Ising model is some kind of paradigm among magnetic models for the 

matter  because  is  the  simplest  one  that  presents  a  phase  transition  at 

temperatures  different  from  zero  (in  D>1,  where  D  is  the  dimension).  But  Ising 

models  have  found  applications  in  areas  away  from  solid-state  physics,  for 

example,  in  immunology  [1]  and  stock  market  theory  [2],  among  many  others.  In 

this  work  we  use  the  2D  Ising  model  to  simulate  the  Earth’s  dynamo,  particularly 

the reversals of the Earth’s magnetic field. 

In absence of external field the Hamiltonian H for the Ising model is: 

H

∑−=

,
ji

ssJ
i
ij

j

                                                  (1) 

where  the  sum  runs  over  all  neighbor  pairs,  si  and  sj  are  spins  and  Jij  is  the 

interaction  constant  between  spins  i  and  j.  The  critical  temperature  of  the  Ising 

system for 2D is TC = 2.269 in units of Jij/kB, where kB is the Boltzmann constant. 

By definition, each spin si can assume only two values or orientations: 1 and –1.  

 

The magnetization M for the model is defined as:  

i∑
s

i

N

M

=

                                                        (2) 

where  the  sum  runs  over  all  the  spins  and  N  is  the  total  number  of  spins.  It  can 

takes values between –1 and 1. While in our model each spin represents a current 

ring in the dynamo, the magnetization represents the magnetic field intensity. 

Geomagnetic  reversals,  periods  during  which  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field 

swap  hemispheres,  have  been  documented  during  the  last  four  decades.  The 

duration of geomagnetic reversals presents power law distribution functions, which 

can be the signature of self-organized criticality as the mechanism of their source 

[3,4]. The sequence of reversals been considered as first returns times. In Figure 1 

we  present  the  sequence  of  geomagnetic  reversals  from  80  Ma  to  our  days.  The 

data was obtained from the more recent and complete record that we have found 

[5]. However, the behavior is much more complex than that, it is necessary a finite 

time  for  the  magnetic  field  changing  its  sign,  the  change  is  not  instantaneous. 

Actually,  the  magnetic  field  takes  continuous  values,  and  not  only,  let  us  say,  a 

maximum positive value and a minimum negative value (as most part of the time in 

Ising  systems  below  the  critical  temperature).  There  are  some  facts  that  can  be 

argued  against  the  possibility  of  self-organized  criticality.  In  particular,  that  there 

are  clustered  periods  of  high  activity  (for  example,  from  40  My  ago  to  now  and 

during the period 165–120 My), periods of low activity (between 80 and 40 My ago) 

and  periods  of  almost  null  activity  (from  120  to  80  My).  Self-organized  criticality 

implies  that  there  are  neither  characteristic  lengths  nor  characteristic  times  [6]. 

Activity  occurs  all  the  time  in  all  the  possible  length  and  time  scales.  The  unique 

relevant length scale is the size of the system (intimately related to the duration of 

the more lasting events). There are other mechanisms capable of producing power 

laws  (for  example,  superposition  of  some  distributions  [7]  and  non-extensive 

versions of statistical mechanics [8]) but we will not extend on them upon here. 

Many efforts have been made to enlarge the size of simulated Ising models 

when  trying  to  represent  systems  of  physical  or  biological  nature.  The  reason  is 

simple:  the  numbers  of  elements  in  condensed  matter  physics  and  biological 

systems are usually huge, around 1023 and 1014, respectively. Physical models for 

the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  are  mostly  based  in  a  small  number  of  adequately 

connected dynamos. So, using small 2D Ising systems to simulate their interaction 

and behavior must sound a natural choice.  

Ising  systems  have  already  been  used  to  simulate  reversals  of  the  Earth 

magnetic  field  [9].  Our  work  differs  from  it  in  that  while  they  used  relatively  large 

systems  though  the  Q2R  automata  we  have  simulated  a  regular  Metropolis 

updating  algorithm  on  small  systems  around  the  critical  temperature.  Our  results 

also essentially differ from them.      

 

2. Simulations and Discussion 

We  have  performed  simulations  on  small  2D  square  Ising  systems  at 

temperatures  near  TC  and  studied  some  of  the  relevant  characteristics  of  the 

distribution  in  time  of  magnetization  reversals  (fluctuations  between  states  of 

positive and negative magnetization when  T<TC). All the simulations run on small 

Ising systems. We have applied periodic boundary conditions [10]. 

In  Figure  2  we  show  typical  magnetization  dependences  on  time  for 

temperatures  slightly  below  TC.  They  qualitatively  resemble  the  results  presented 

in figures 3 and 5 of reference [9]. However, they are quantitatively different from 

them  (see  below).  Figure  3  shows  the  result  of  eliminating  all  the  fluctuations  in 

Figure 2. We have only marked the jumps through the value zero and assigned a 

value  1  to  all  the  positive  values  and  –1  for  the  negative  ones.  Note  the  pictorial 

and qualitative similarity between figures 1 and 3. In particular, note that Figure 3 

also  presents  clustered  periods  of  greater  activity  (between  ~6500  and  10000 

MCS/s) and of lower activity (between ~4000 and 6500 MCS/s, for example). 

 Figure  4  shows  the  distribution  of  intervals  between  consecutive  reversals 

(T=2.26) for different system sizes. The bold straight line is a guide for the eye in 

all  cases.  It  is  a  general  feature  that  for  small  periods  the  distribution  follows  a 

power law: 

f

=)(
t

dct

                                                        (3) 

where f(t) is the frequency distribution of periods between consecutive reversals, c 

is  a  proportionality  constant  and  d  is  the  exponent  of  the  power-law.  For  larger 

periods the distribution is an exponential. The exponential dependence can easily 

be confirmed be representing  the data in a semi-log graph (not shown). However 

its  apparition  presents  a  size  dependence,  for  5x5  systems  it  occupies  almost  all 

the  histogram  interval  while  for  systems  of  size  50x50  it  is  almost  inexistent.  The 

results  for  the  slope  value  range  from  –2.0  (for  5x5  systems)  to  –1.55  (for  50x50 

systems).  These  results  are  far  from  the  –0.5  value  obtained  by  Seki  and  Ito  [9]. 

However,  as  can  be  seen,  the  larger  the  system  the  closer  to  the  most  accepted 

value  (–1.5)  for  this  slope.  There  are  some  recent  results  [4]  suggesting  that  a 

value –1.42 might be more reliable.  

To  complete  this  part  of  our  research  we  have  also  performed  a  no 

pretentious  study  on  sizes  effects.  For  this  we  have  simulated  system  sizes  5x5, 

10x10,  20x20,  30x30,  40x40  and  50x50  for  the  same  temperature  T  =  2.26  (very 

near  TC  to  avoid  huge  simulation  times  for  the  largest  systems).  The  results  are 

shown in Figure 5. The data is satisfactorily fitted by an exponential function.  

We  show  in  Figure  6  the  distribution  of  magnetization  values  (T=2.26)  for 

5x5  and  50x50  systems.  For  the  smallest  system  that  we  have  simulated  the 

maxima  occur  at  the  extreme  values  M  =  ±1.  For  larger  systems  they  occur  at 

intermediate values. This can be partially explained by fluctuations. While for small 

system fluctuations can drive the system to absolute values of magnetization near 

1,  and  there  are  not  a  counterpart,  for  larger  system,  a  fluctuation  to  an  absolute 

value near 1 in a part of the system will be accompanied by a value far from those 

values in other pieces of the system. We have not risked fit the distribution by any 

function  because  our  model  introduced  and  artificial  cut-off  for  the  field  intensity 

(maximum absolute magnetization 1). Contrary to the record of reversals (from 160 

My  up  to  nowadays)  the  record  of  magnetic  field  intensities  exists  just  for  a  few 

thousand  years.  The  distribution  of  magnetic  field  intensities  for  actual  reversals 

follows  a  function  between  a  normal  and  a  log-normal  distribution.  However,  the 

number of experimental points is small and there will certainly be changes in these 

facts  when  new  measurements  become  available.  There  are  two  points  to  be 

highlighted:  as 

in  our  simulations 

the  distribution  of 

intensities 

for  real 

measurements  is  almost  perfectly  symmetric  and  there  is  a  valley  (less  frequent) 

for  values  near  zero  intensity.  The  symmetry  is  not  observed  in  the  work  by  Seki 

and Ito [9].  

Figure  7  shows  the  dependence  of  the  average  duration  of  time  intervals 

between consecutive reversals on temperature (always for temperatures near the 

critical  point).  These  results  can  help  us  to  understand  the  way  in  which  external 

factors  affect 

the  reversal  regime.  For  more 

intense  perturbations  (high 

temperatures) the reversals are more frequent. For less intense perturbations (low 

temperatures) there is a lower number of reversals for time unit.   

In our simulations the temperature plays the role of a tuning parameter. For 

temperatures  well  above  TC  we  observe  only  fluctuations  around  M  =  0,  for 

temperatures well below TC we observe a state of constant magnetization values 1 

or  –1  with  seldom  flips  to  –1  or  1  values,  respectively.  We  have  studied  the 

dependence of the power-law slope on temperature for temperatures T around TC 

(Figure 8). Note that for temperatures near TC or above the slope remains almost 

constant and in a narrow interval (from –1.75 to –1.55). The model is robust (in this 

particular) to temperature variations. The point at T = 1.23 most be regarded with 

some  suspicion.  It  contradicts,  at  least  intuitively,  what  we  could  expect:  for  low 

temperatures reversals are rare. This means that small and large intervals between 

consecutive reversals must have similar probabilities consequently diminishing the 

slope  of  the  distribution  function.  We  believe  that  for  that  temperature  our 

simulations did not run for long enough times.  

Finally, Figure 9 presents the mean interval between consecutive reversals 

as  a  function  of  the  system  size.  That  dependence  gives  some  qualitative  insight 

on  which  is  the  volume  of  Earth’s  interior  that  effectively  carries  the  currents  that 

produce the magnetic field. For larger systems reversals are less frequent than for 

small systems. 

 

3. Conclusions 

We  have  simulated  small  2D  Ising  systems  to  mimic  the  time  dependence  of 

geomagnetic reversals. There are several things to be learnt from our simulations. 

The  almost  perfect  symmetry  of  magnetization  distributions  is  the  fingerprint  that 

our simulations were running for a long enough time. Any future work along these 

lines should reproduce our results. The model seems to be robust to temperature 

variations  (in  the  slope  of  the  distribution  for  intervals  between  consecutive 

reversals). There is a dependence of the mean interval between reversals in both 

temperature  and  system  size.  These  facts  make  difficult  to  distinguish  which  of 

them  can  be  the  cause  of  the  clustering  observed  in  actual  reversals.  The 

necessity  of  more  detailed  models  including  dissipation  is  apparent.  Some  works 

along these lines are currently running and will be published elsewhere.

Abstract. The PASER is potentially a very attractive method for particle acceleration, in which 
energy from an active medium is transferred to a charged particle beam. The effect is similar to 
the action of a maser or laser with the stimulated emission of radiation being produced  by the 
virtual  photons  in  the  electromagnetic  field  of  the  beam.  We  have  been  investigating  the 
possibility of developing a demonstration PASER operating at X-band. The less restrictive beam 
transport and device dimensional tolerances required for working at X-band rather than optical 
frequencies as well as the widespread application of X-band hardware in accelerator technology 
all  contribute  to  the  attractiveness  of  performing  a  PASER  demonstration  experiment  in  this 
frequency range. Key to this approach is the availability of a new class of active materials that 
exhibit photoinduced electron spin polarization. We will report on the status of active material 
development  and  measurements,  numerical  simulations,  and  progress  towards  a  planned 
microwave PASER acceleration experiment at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility.

INTRODUCTION 

The original PASER concept [1-4] focused principally on the use of an optical or 
infrared  wavelength  active  medium  to  provide  the  energy  for  accelerating  electrons. 
Recent  studies  of  electron  paramagnetic  resonance  (EPR)  in  nematic  liquid  crystal 
solutions  of  fullerene  or  porphyrin  compounds  have  demonstrated  activity  (negative 
imaginary part of the  magnetic susceptibility)  in the ~10 GHz  frequency range when 
the material is optically pumped [5,6]. Unlike conventional solid state maser materials, 
the C60 based materials can operate at relatively high temperatures. Building on prior 
work  in  this  area  we  have  developed  and  synthesized  new  active  paramagnetic 
materials with improved gain and bandwidth properties over those previously reported 
in  the  literature  and  performed  CW  and  time-resolved  electron  paramagnetic 
resonance measurements demonstrating the activity of the media.  

In order to evaluate the usefulness of the active media for particle acceleration, we 
are  building  a  test  system  to  measure  the  electromagnetic  properties  of  active  media 
loaded prototype accelerating structures using standard microwave techniques. We are 
also evaluating options for a demonstration accelerator experiment.  

Besides  the  EPR  measurements  and  the  experimental  design  efforts  that  are  the 
main  subject  of  this  paper,  we  are  also  proceeding  with  simulation  and  theoretical 
activities  in  support  of  the  microwave  PASER  project.  Refs.  [14-16]  provide  some 
additional details. 

PROGRESS IN ACTIVE PARAMAGNETIC MATERIALS; C60-LC 
AS A HIGH TEMPERATURE MASER MEDIUM 

The  first  optically  pumped  solid-state  maser  based  on  electron  paramagnetic 
resonance (EPR) was proposed in 1957 [7] and demonstrated successfully in 1962 [8]. 
To achieve amplification in a paramagnetic material based maser, one must achieve an 
inverted  spin  population.  These  original  masers  did  not  find  wide  applications  as 
among other limitations they require low temperatures ~10 K for operation. A recently 
published article [0], however, reports the observation of  maser amplification at near 
room  temperature  in  an  optically  pumped  fullerene-based  material  at  ≈9  GHz—  an 
ideal  frequency  match  to  the  beam  parameters  currently  available  at  accelerator  test 
facilities  such  as  AWA.  Three-level  solid-state  maser  amplifiers  based  upon  the 
paramagnetic properties of the unpaired electron exploit changes  in the electron spin 
population  of 
thus  allowing  amplification  of 
electromagnetic radiation in the bulk material [11].

The C60 fullerene molecule was first identified in 1985 [9] as a third stable form of 
elemental  carbon.  Unlike  diamond  and  graphite,  C60  is  soluble  in  a  large  number  of 
organic solvents. The active X-band  media that we have  been studying are primarily 
solutions of C60 in liquid crystals. While there are still many aspects of the physics of 
the  maser  process  in  these  materials  that  are  not  yet  completely  understood,  the 
general picture is clear.  

This  work  relies  heavily  on  both  CW  and  time-resolved  EPR  (electron 
paramagnetic resonance, also known as ESR, electron spin resonance)  measurements 
[10]  of  candidate  LC-fullerene  materials.    The  basic  EPR  resonance  condition  in  a 
ω is the resonance frequency,  βis 
paramagnetic spin system is 
the  Bohr  magneton,  and  H  is  the  magnetic  field  strength.  A  free  electron  has 
g=2 .002322.  The  g-factor  varies  for  the  most  part  between  1  and  ~2  depending  on 
spin-orbit  interactions  in  the  material;  many  radicals  and  paramagnetic  complexes 
have g-factors larger than 2.

Typically  EPR  measurements  are  made  with  a  constant  frequency  X-band 
microwave  source,  and  the  spectrum  is  actually  obtained  by  sweeping  the  applied 
magnetic field (H~3000 Oe for λ~3 cm). (This will have interesting consequences for 
the  use  of  these  materials  in  accelerators—tuning  the  resonant  frequency  can  be 
accomplished  by  changing  the  magnetic  field.)  Finally,  the  gyromagnetic  ratio  is 
defined as

/gγ β=

h . 

The population difference ∆N between the spin levels is directly related to  χ′′  (the 
imaginary  part  of  the  magnetic  susceptibility)  which  is  indirectly  measured  in  EPR 
experiments.  The  C60  molecule  in  its  ground  state  is  not  EPR  active.  However  after 
photoexcitation of C60 by a short pump laser or flash lamp pulse an EPR active triplet 
state  can  be  formed.  In  ordinary  solvents  like  toluene  or  benzene,  the  dipole-dipole 
interaction  averages  to  zero;  there  is  no  zero  field  splitting  of  the  triplet  state.  The 
0Hω γ=
unsplit state can only absorb rf energy at
The EPR spectra and activity of C60 are strongly dependent on the solvent used. It 
is important for our purposes that C60 in different organic solvents or liquid crystals is 
light  sensitive  and  undergoes  reversible  changes  in  the  optical  or  EPR  absorption 
spectra. We have synthesized and studied a number of C60 based materials to study the 
effect of solvent type, C60 concentration, and additional solutes like porphyrins on the 
activity of the media. One particular material, a C60–porphyrin-LC solution was found 
to  exhibit  significantly  improved  amplification  properties  over  previously  studied 
substances.

The effect of the nematic liquid crystal component (rodlike molecules that align to 
exhibit a long range 1D order) is to introduce a symmetry breaking. The dipole-dipole 
interaction in the triplet state does not completely average to zero). The triplet state in 
each fullerene molecule now undergoes a Zeeman splitting into three levels. If the spin 
energy  levels  of  the  fullerene  triplet  state  become  selectively  populated,  stimulated 
emission can occur.

The  activity  in  these  materials  originates  in  chemically  induced  dynamic  electron 
spin  polarization  (CIDEP).  CIDEP  is  formed  in  reactions  of  radicals  resulting  from 
optical  pumping  that  in  turn  lead  to  the  formation  of  free  radicals  or  triplet  state 
molecules.  There  are  several  different  mechanisms  of  CIDEP–  triplet  [13],  radical 
pair, radical pair-triplet etc.  

Figure 1 shows a schematic energy level diagram for the active media discussed in 
this report. After absorption of the laser pulse molecules transition from the S0 (initial 
singlet) state to the S1 (excited) state. Following a fast intersystem crossing the excited 

molecule transitions from S1 to the triplet T1 state. In the triplet state the spin levels are 
split into three levels (in the case of negligible hyperfine interaction with nuclei). As a 
rule the rate constants of the transitions from the S1 state to the Tx, Ty, Tz states are 
different resulting in electron polarization due to the triplet mechanism.  In the case of 
a  long  triplet  molecule  lifetime  the  polarization  of  this  triplet  molecule  can  be 
observed.  In  many  cases  the  triplet  molecule  produces  radicals  (due  to  chemical 
reactions)  and  polarization  on  these  radicals  can  be  observed.    Other  mechanisms  of 
CIDEP  result  from  interaction  of  radicals  and  their  spin  dynamics  and  chemical 
kinetics.

Also affecting the performance of C60–LC media are the relatively large dielectric 
losses (tan δ>0.005) from the liquid crystal component. Cooling the material to -20 C 
is probably necessary to keep losses small. So far it seems that large tan δ is intrinsic 
to  the  nematic  LCs  currently  available,  although  reducing  the  loss  tangent  by 
appropriate  choice  of  solvent  is  not  ruled  out.  Our  approach  to  this  problem  is  to 
design  accelerator  and  bench  test  structures  that  make  use  of  mode  symmetries  to 
locate the active medium in a region where the electric field is small and the magnetic 
field (which couples to the permeability) is large.  

We have considered a number of possible implementations of active media devices 
for particle acceleration. The first involves acceleration of a single bunch by the active 
medium  (the  basic  PASER  concept)  in  a  resonant  structure,  similar  to  the  dielectric 
wakefield  accelerator,  with  the  fundamental  resonant  frequency  of  the  structure 
adjusted  to  correspond  to  the  frequency  of  the  masing  transition.  (The  medium  is  a 
viscous  liquid  but  can  be  isolated  from  the  beam  channel  by  a  thin  walled  quartz 
capillary.) Extensive calculations have shown that this design is marginal for studying 
acceleration for lossy media, since for TM modes there is no region where large B and 
small E fields can be obtained simultaneously. 

A  much  more promising approach  is to use an  iris  loaded structure partially  filled 
with an active  medium and tuned to the  frequency of the  maser  line. In this case the 

>

vanishing of the radial electric field on the irises results in a region for approximately 
where the magnetic field dominates. For the bench test a single pillbox cavity 
r
will be used to obtain the same effect.

The  liquid  crystal  component  of  the  active  material  has  a  permittivity  ~2  and 
dielectric  loss  tangent  >0.005.  This  implies  two  kinds  of  loss  mechanisms  for  the 
PASER  that  originate  in  the  dielectric,  ohmic  (Joule  heating)  and  non-dissipative 
energy  losses  from  Cherenkov  radiation/wakefields.  While  these  are  nontrivial 
concerns, the estimated wakefield losses for an 10 GHz device/1 pC beam are roughly 
~0.5  keV/m  compared  to  a  limiting  accelerating  gradient  of  6.6  MV/m.  Dielectric 
losses  are  a  more  serious  problem.  One  option  that  we  are  investigating  is  the 
possibility  of  structure  modifications  so  that  the  active  medium  is  located  near  a 
minimum  in the electric  field  but  in a region where the magnetic  field  is sufficiently 
large.  We  also  are  planning  to  evaluate  the  use  of  other  liquid  crystals.  Part  of  this 
investigation will involve tests of reduced loss LC materials. 

The  efficiency  of  a  laser  pumped  active  microwave  medium  will  be  relatively 
small. In the simplest estimate the efficiency  is  (
. This 
is  somewhat  offset  by  the  less  stringent  quality  requirements  on  the  optical  pump 
source;  clearly,  however  some  form  of  energy  recovery  must  be  used  for  a  practical 
PASER accelerator based on this medium.

EPR MEASURMENTS OF C60 –BASED ACTIVE MEDIA 

In time resolved (TR) EPR we apply  a pump  laser pulse to the test sample  in the 
spectrometer.  The  resulting  EPR  signal  is  measured  using  a  digital  oscilloscope  to 
obtain a time-resolved spectrum.  This technique is especially relevant to the diagnosis 
of  activity  in  our  samples  since  the  generation  of  a  population  inversion  in  the 
fullerene-liquid  crystal  solution  requires  an  optical  pulse  excitation.  TR  EPR 
measurements  of  photoexcited  C60  in  different  matrices  were  carried  out  using  a 
Bruker  ESP-380  CW  spectrometer  with  its  field  modulation  disconnected.  The  time 
resolution  of  the  system  is  40  ns.  The  temperature  in  the  EPR  resonator  was 
maintained by using a variable temperature nitrogen flow Dewar system. The samples 
in  the  microwave  cavity  of  the  spectrometer  were  photoexcited  at  532  nm  by  the 
second harmonic of a Nd:YAG laser producing 10-ns duration pulses of  15 mJ/pulse 
at a repetition rate of 10 Hz.   

We  used  this  technique  to  evaluate  the  activities  of  different  reference  and  active 
media samples.  We report the results  here  for C60–toluene, C60–E7, and  C60 –TPhP–
E7. The EPR spectra for these materials are shown in Figure 2.  

The  toluene  solution  is  used  as  a  reference  sample  for  the  active  media 
measurements. After laser flash irradiation of a solution of C60 in toluene at 253 K a 
single  absorption EPR  line  is observed at g = 2.0026. It exhibits a  nearly  Lorentzian 
lineshape  with  width  ∆B1/2  =  0.5  G  [12].  The  presence  of  only  a  single  absorption 
peak is due to the fast rotation of the molecules which tends to average the zero field 
splitting (ZFS) factor to zero.  

It is evident that the spectra shown for both the liquid crystal solutions exhibit ESP, 
demonstrating both emission and absorptive characteristics. (The liquid crystal used as 
a solvent in these samples is E7, produced commercially by Merck.)  

Photoexcitation  of  a  1:1  mixture  of  C60  and  H2Tetraphenylporphyrin  (H2TPhP) 
results  in  the  appearance  of  a  spectrum  consisting  of  two  components.  A  narrow 
spectrum  (~10  G)  (the  light  “break”  or  “bend”  near  the  zero  crossing  in  Fig.  2)  is 
superimposed on a broad one (~170 G). The broad spectrum may be attributed to the 
triplet    3H2TPhP (dominant) [16], and the narrow part to 3C60. 

In  this  experiment  both  C60  and  H2TPhP  absorb  light.  The  main  polarization  is 
observed on a triplet state of H2TPhP while the polarization of C60 is about one order 
of  magnitude  less. The  spectrum obtained  is qualitatively different  from that of C60–
E7. The broad spectrum shows the inversion of absorption – emission lines from low 
to  high  magnetic  field,  respectively.  The  observed  decay  time  of  the  polarization  is 
about 1500 ns. The improvement in bandwidth and spin population (by factors of ~10 
and ~1.5 respectively) over the C60-E7 material is clearly visible in Figure 2. 

Despite the attribution of the two components of  the spectrum to (predominantly) 
TPhP and C60 the overall form of the spectrum is not simply the sum of the individual 
spectra. Rather, the spectrum results from the complex interaction of the excited states 
of the two components in the solution. A detailed analysis of the mechanism of ESP in 
the  3C60-TPhP complex  in  liquid crystals as well  as the possibility of  increasing ESP 
intensity in similar systems is in progress.  

We have found that among all the investigated samples that H2TPhP–C60 in liquid 
crystal  E7  is  the  most  promising  agent  for  applications  in  microwave  amplification. 

The  first  advantage  of  this  system  is  the  width  of  the  EPR  spectrum  of  the  triplet 
molecule of H2TPhP–C60 is 300 MHz for both emission and absorption lines, allowing 
broad  band  microwave  operation.  In  addition  the  reversibility  of  the  photochemical 
reactions  in  this  material  implies  the  ability  to  use  the  medium  over  many  pump-
discharge cycles.  

MICROWAVE PASER EXPERIMENTS 

At  present  all  of  the  measurements  of  active  microwave  media  discussed  in  this 
paper  have  been  performed  using  very  small  samples  in  EPR  spectrometers.  We  are 
building  a  system  to  study  prototype  microwave  PASER  structures  with  standard 
electronic test instruments (Figure 3).  

An  elliptical  cell  fabricated  from  aluminum  or  other  nonferromagnetic  material 
serves  both  as  support  for  the  test  cell  and  flash  lamp,  while  its  interior  mirrored 
surface  concentrates  the  light  from  the  flashlamp  onto  the  test  cell.  The  cell 
dimensions  allow  it  to  be  mounted  inside  the  bore  of  the  solenoid  that  provides  the 
magnetic  field  for  the  paramagnetic  resonance.  The  flashlamp  and  test  cell  are 
mounted at the foci of the ellipse. Endcaps on the cell will provide mechanical support 
for  the  test  cavity  and  flashlamp.  The  test  cavity  is  an  X-band  resonator  and 
waveguide  that  contains  the  active  medium.  Measurements  of  the  reflection  and 
transmission coefficients require rf energy to be coupled into and out of the cell. The 
outer  quartz  tube  is  covered  with  axial  conducting  strips  forming  transparent 
longitudinal slit windows. The conducting strips will be in electrical contact with the 
endcaps.  The  strips  may  be  deposited  using  printed  circuit  technology;  alternatively 
copper tape or enamel insulated wires could be used. The pumping radiation is input to 
the  medium  through  these  slits.  This  technique  preserves  the  symmetry  of  the  TM 
modes.

By adjusting the solenoid  field we  can adjust the resonant  frequency of the active 
medium  to  coincide  with  the  resonant  frequency  of  each  mode  of  the  structure, thus 
any or all of the X-band modes can be employed for these measurements.  

A  microwave  PASER  acceleration  demonstration  is  challenging  on  a  number  of 
levels. The portions of the accelerating structure containing the active medium must be 
supplied with pump energy from a flashlamp or laser and also maintained in a uniform 
magnetic field of about 3 kG for X-band operation. We have been considering several 
possible geometries  for PASER experiments.  A possible approach  is to use a trigger 
beam  to  excite  a  wakefield  that  is  then  amplified  by  the  active  medium  and  used  to 
accelerate  a  second  beam  [4,  17].  Technologies  based  on  the  wakefield  amplifier 
approach are currently favored as the basis for a beam experiment.  

One  challenge  is providing the  magnetic  field  for the  medium along the  length of 
the structure, an approach that would require a very long solenoid to implement along 
the  lines  of  the  bench  test.  We  are  considering  a  combination  of  the  following 
approaches to simplify the design of the beam test structure: 
•  Permanent  magnets  for  providing  the  EPR  magnetic  field.  The  use  of  permanent 
magnets  offers  an  attractive  alternative  to  the  use  of  electromagnets  in  terms  of 
cost,  compactness,  and  efficiency.  Fields  in  the  required  range  (~3  kG)  can  be 
easily obtained. A planar geometry for the medium could be used to minimize the 
gap  size  in  the  magnet  and  hence  the  amount  of  permanent  magnet  material 
required. 

•  Use  of  fiber  optics  or  light  guides  to  transport  the  pump  radiation  to  the  active 
material.  This  allows  considerably  more  flexibility  in  the  configuration  of  the 
structure  and  magnets.  In  particular  the  pump  signals  could  be  supplied  through 
small gaps in the magnets rather than requiring the structure and light source to be 
immersed in the magnetic field.  

•  Nonaxisymmetric  structures.  Removing  the  active  medium  from  the  beam  path 
results in a considerable simplification of beam transport and reduction of magnet 
costs (due to the reduction in the magnetic field volume required).  

CONCLUSIONS 

A  number  of  chemical  systems,  consisting  of  C60  and  porphyrin  molecules  in  a 
liquid  crystal  matrix  have  been  synthesized  and  EPR  tested  as  candidate  active 
materials  for  use  in  X-band  microwave  PASER  experiments.  The  performance  of 
accelerators based on this technology has been evaluated. A design for a bench test of 
a microwave PASER cavity prototype has been developed and is under construction at 
ANL.  Some  possible  options  for  a  beam  acceleration  experiment  have  been 
considered.

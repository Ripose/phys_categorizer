Instrumentation for atmospheric ion measurements 

 
 
Abstract 

 
Small  ions  are  part  of  the  atmospheric  aerosol  spectrum,  and  study  of  ion-aerosol 

interactions 

is 

fundamental 

in  atmospheric  physics.  Air 

ion  physics  and 

instrumentation are reviewed, including the historical context. A miniaturised Gerdien 

condenser  for  ion  measurement,  operating  in  situ  to  minimise  inlet  errors,  is 

described.  Two  operating  modes  using  independent  current  and  voltage  decay 

measurements  are  employed.  A  more  sophisticated  self-calibrating  and  fully 

programmable ion mobility spectrometer (PIMS) based on the same principles, is also 

discussed.  Detailed  analysis  of  error  terms  and  application  of  new  technology  is 

demonstrated 

to  greatly  improve  its  capability.  A  variety  of  self-consistent 

experimental  approaches,  including  ionisation  and  ion  concentration  instruments,  is 

used to calibrate the new PIMS instrument.  

 

 

In developing and characterising the individual components of the PIMS, favourable 

and unfavourable operating r√ògimes are identified: this approach can also be applied 

to  other  aspiration  ion  counting  techniques.  Use  of  a  sophisticated  programmable 

electrometer  permits  compensation  for  leakage  terms.  Electrically-charged  aerosol 

particles  have  been  found  to  complicate  the  ion  measurements.  Consequently, 

conventional  ion-aerosol  theory,  which  neglects  the  particulate  concentration,  is 

thought  to  be  incomplete.  The  polymodal  ion  mobility  spectrum  is  also  found  to 

influence the instrument(cid:146)s operation.  

The classical theory for calculating air conductivity from voltage decay measurements 

is  modified  to  take  account  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrum,  and  a  new  technique  to 

obtain  ion  mobility  spectra  by  inversion  is  presented.  Ion  mobility  spectra  are  also 

derived  using    conventional  ion  current  measurements,  and  the  two  methods  of 

obtaining  ion  spectra  from  independent  PIMS  measurements  are  shown  to  be 

consistent.  Development  of  the  novel  programmable  ion  instrumentation,  in 

conjunction with  consideration  of  the ion  mobility spectrum yields an improved and 

flexible approach to in situ atmospheric ion measurements.

This project was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. I would like 

to thank Dr. Giles Harrison for his continual guidance and boundless enthusiasm for a 

subject that has also captured my imagination. The Meteorology Department technical 

team all deserve special thanks: Andrew Lomas for lots more than sorting out my PC 

problems  and  messy  cables,  and  Stephen  Gill  for  his  excellent  workmanship  and 

coming  to  rescue  me  from  Mace  Head.  Assistance  in  all  matters  electronic  was 

provided by Roger Knight, who also helped to proof-read, and Steven Tames. 

I  have  had  extremely  interesting  and  useful  conversations  with Dr. Charles Clement 

throughout  the  course  of  my  studies.  Dr.  Jyrgi  M(cid:228)kel(cid:228)  provided  valuable  insight 

during the long afternoon in Geneva when he was unable to escape my questioning. 

My family and friends have been extremely supportive and encouraging, particularly 

during  difficult  times.  My  mother  and  brother  Mark  proof-read  the  majority  of  this 

Thesis. Mark(cid:146)s comments in particular were both helpful and hilarious during the long 

days of writing up. I thank Daniel Meacham for his friendship, humour and interest in 

my work. My late hamster, Hilary, was always an endearing distraction. 

The musical life of the Meteorology Department has added an extra dimension to my 

time  here.  My  devotion  to  one  musical  instrument  has  occasionally  superseded  my 

commitment to the scientific instruments I chose to make my career. It, and the people 

I meet with similar interests continue to inspire me.

1.1  Introduction  

The physics of electrically-charged clusters of molecules in the atmosphere, air ions, 

is  inextricably  entwined  with  the  behaviour  of  other,  larger  particulates  comprising 

the  atmospheric  aerosol.  In  one  of  the  first  publications  in  this  area,  Rutherford‚Äôs 

(1897)  comments  encapsulated  what  is  now  known  about  ion-aerosol  interactions 

with remarkable prescience, 

(cid:147)Later  experiments  on  the  influence  of  dust  in  the  air  led  to  the 

conclusion that it was due to the presence of finely divided matter, liquid 

or  solid,  in  the  freshly  prepared  gas(cid:133)  The  presence  of  dust  in  the  air 

was  found  to  very  greatly  affect  the  (cid:133)  conductivity(cid:133)  Since  the  dust-

particles  are  very  large  compared  to  the  ions,  an  ion  is  more  likely  to 

strike against dust-particle, and give up its charge to it or to adhere to 

the surface, than to collide with an ion of opposite sign. In this way, the 

rate of loss of conductivity is(cid:133) rapid.(cid:148) 

Rutherford  (1897)  knew  that  the  presence  of  aerosol  particles  reduced  the  ion 
concentration,  and  hence  the  electrical  conductivity  of  the  air1,  by  attachment.  This 
tenet  has  remained  at  the  heart  of  ion-aerosol  theory  for  over  a  hundred  years2.  Yet 

there  is  still  a  need  to  explore  the  physics  of  air  ions  and  their  interactions  with 

atmospheric aerosol within and beyond Rutherford(cid:146)s framework.  

Aerosol is a collective term for the myriad of particles present in the atmosphere. The 
size spectrum of these suspended particulates ranges from the smallest cluster ions3 to 
relatively large organic matter with radii of order 10-4 m (Pruppacher and Klett, 1998). 

The  significance  of  these  particles  for  climate  and  health  is  a  strong  motivation  for 

understanding them further. Rutherford(cid:146)s  (1897) comments suggest the behaviour of 

                                                           
1 Air conductivity and air ion concentration are directly proportional.

charged aerosol particles and have a distribution of electrical charges, whereas intermediate and small

aerosol  can  be  inferred  from  observing  its  interaction  with  ions.  The  electrical 

properties of air ions permit application of experimental techniques that could not be 

used to measure the bulk properties of aerosol, which are not sufficiently charged to 

be  deflected  by  modest  electrical  fields.  Ions  are  the  smallest  form  of  atmospheric 

particulates, therefore studying them can give insight into the formation and growth of 

larger aerosol particles, which have a greater direct atmospheric impact. 

 

 

1.2  Atmospheric aerosol 

The  increased  political  significance  of  environmental  science  has  necessitated 

investigation  and  characterisation  of  atmospheric  aerosol  particles.  Atmospheric 

aerosol absorbs infrared radiation and is significant in climate forcing. Knowledge of 

aerosol concentrations is crucial for climate models, and this entails an understanding 

of  aerosol  production  and  removal  mechanisms.  Although  the  science  of  climate 

change  is  largely  based  on  computer  modelling,  real  measurements  of  aerosol  are 

vitally important to both support and corroborate them. 

On  a  smaller  scale,  the  emission  of  aerosol  from  vehicles  and  industry  is  also  a 
pressing issue. Aerosols of radius less than 10 ¬µm are small enough to penetrate deep 

into  the  human  lungs  and  have  become classified  as PM10 and  PM2.5,  with PM2.5 
being smaller than 2.5 ¬µm. (The distinction arises because PM2.5 can penetrate within 

the  alveoli  of  the  lungs,  whereas  PM10  cannot).  Contemporary  studies  have 

recognised  their  effects  on  the  body,  and  have  identified  aerosol  particles  as  an 

important type of pollution. The emission and dispersion of such pollutants needs to 

be  better  understood  to  improve  public  health.  Yet  such  essential,  and  apparently 

simple, scientific problems  like measuring aerosol  pollutants in different size ranges 

have  not  been  completely  solved.  Gravimetric  and  optical  instruments  commonly 

used for measurement of PM10 and PM2.5 only operate within certain (often poorly 

defined) size ranges. Furthermore, there is increasing concern about the health effects 

of  the  very  smallest  particles  which  are  often  missed  by  common  measurement 

methods,  despite  making  up  the  main  body  of  the  aerosol  number  concentration. 

There is therefore a clear need to continue increasing our understanding of the whole 

spectrum of atmospheric aerosol.

Ions in the atmosphere 

1.2.1  Aerosol nucleation 
An  important  mechanism  of  aerosol  formation  is  gas-to-particle  conversion  (GPC) 

(Pruppacher  and  Klett,  1998),  where  gas  molecules  become  clustered  together  to 

create  a  macroscopic  particle.  Homogeneous  nucleation  is  typically  a  catalysed  gas 

phase  chemical  reaction,  by  which  sulphates  and  some  ammonium  salts  can  be 

produced. Homogeneous nucleation of water vapour can only occur spontaneously in 

highly supersaturated vapour. Such supersaturations are not found in the atmosphere. 

Tropospheric water vapour clouds are observed to form readily at supersaturations of 

2 %,  which  cannot  be  accounted  for  by  the  theory  of  homogeneous  nucleation. 

Therefore,  another  mechanism  nucleating  water  vapour  into  droplets  must  be 

occurring: this is heterogeneous nucleation, which requires the presence of some pre-

existing  particle  to  reduce  the  vapour  pressure  at  which  condensation  occurs.  The 

particles  which  can  potentially  act  as  nucleii  for  cloud droplet growth are known as 
condensation  nucleii  or  CN4,  and  are  part  of  the  aerosol  continuum.  CN 

concentrations  are  typically  a  few  thousand  per  cubic  centimetre;  concentrations  are 

higher in urban areas, and depleted in marine environments.  

 

Ion-induced nucleation, the growth of an aerosol particle by vapour condensing onto 

an ion, has been shown to be theoretically possible by Castleman (1982). This effect 

has  yet  to  be  observed  in  the  atmosphere,  although  it  has  been  measured  in  the 

laboratory  on  several  occasions  (e.g.  Bricard  et  al,  1968).  There  is  also  provocative 

evidence  to  suggest  that  ion-assisted  nucleation  is  an  aerosol-forming  process, 

particularly in areas where CN may be depleted. Rapid (cid:147)bursts(cid:148) of particle growth are 

commonly observed at Mace Head on the west coast of Ireland (O(cid:146)Dowd et al, 1996), 

and have not been explained. Slower ionic growth has also been reported in Estonia, 

and it has been suggested that this is the first stage of a nucleation process (Hƒ±rrak et 

al,  1998a).  A  mechanism  for  ion-induced  nucleation  in  the  atmosphere  has  been 

proposed  (Turco  et  al,  1998;  Yu  and  Turco,  2000),  but  not  observed,  and  there  is 

some  disagreement  whether  the  ionisation  rates  used  in  Yu  and  Turco(cid:146)s  (2000) 

simulation  are  appropriate  (Harrison  and  Aplin,  2000b).  Therefore the potential  r(cid:244)le 

of  ions  in  climate  processes  remains  controversial  and  uncertain.  Whatever  ions(cid:146) 

                                                           
4 CN which do nucleate water vapour at atmospheric supersaturations are known as cloud condensation 
nucleii (CCN).

precise importance, it is clear that they need to be characterised in detail in order to 

gain any understanding of physical mechanisms in which they could be implicated. 

1.2.2  The solar cycle and climate 
The possibility of solar modulation of the Earth(cid:146)s climate has long been a contentious 

issue,  with  many  correlations  reported  which  are  frequently  dubious  or  short-lived. 

Ney  (1959)  speculated  that  changes  in  cosmic  ray  intensity  would  cause  increased 

storminess,  cloudiness  and  affect  the  earth(cid:146)s  weather  systems.  Svensmark  and  Friis-

Christensen  (1997) have observed a correlation between the cosmic ray flux and the 

cloud  cover  on  the  Earth.  Short-term  fluctuations  in  cosmic  ray  activity,  known  as 

Forbush  decreases,  have  also  been  associated with  changing cloud cover (Pudovkin 

and  Veretenko,  1995).  The  cosmic  ray  flux  is  modulated  by  the  solar  cycle  because 

when solar activity is at a maximum, the sun(cid:146)s magnetic field is sufficiently large to 

deflect the least energetic (sometimes called (cid:147)soft(cid:148)) cosmic rays away from the Earth. 

Cosmic  rays  are  primarily  made  up  of  energetic  protons  and  alpha  particles 

(Svensmark  and  Friis-Christensen,  1997)  and  so  have  an  ionising  effect,  including 

generating  air  ions.  During  solar  minima,  more  cosmic  rays  reach  the  earth(cid:146)s 

atmosphere  where  they  can  ionise  atmospheric  molecules:  variations  in  ionisation 

result.  

 

 

The  influence  of  cosmic  rays  on  ionisation  is  well  accepted,  but  recent  controversy 

concerns  the  proposition  that  ions  help  to  form  CN,  which  changes  the  cloud  cover 

over the earth. There is no existing atmospheric experimental evidence to support or 

refute  hypotheses  associating  ionisation  and  particle  formation,  so  increased 

observations of ionic processes are essential. Ion mobility spectra, which can resolve 

ionic  growth,  are  one  such  set  of  necessary  data,  but  the  instrumentation  to  make 

routine atmospheric ion measurements is lacking. Until such instrumentation has been 

developed, testing the hypothesis that ionisation affects CN in the atmosphere would 

remain unfeasible.  

1.3  Atmospheric small ions 

Atmospheric  small  ions  are  small  molecular  clusters  carrying  a  net  electric  charge. 

They  are  produced  by  ionisation  of  molecules  in  the  air,  and  these  initial  ions  are 

quickly  clustered  by  water  molecules  to  produce  a  central,  singly  charged,  ion 

Chapter 1

Ions in the atmosphere 

surrounded  by  4-10  water  molecules.  Air  ions  exist  at  typical  ground  level 

concentrations over land of, on average, a few hundred per cubic centimetre. They are 

subject to considerable variability from atmospheric turbulence and transport effects. 

This  influences  the  ion  concentration  both  directly  and  indirectly  via  the  aerosol 

population, as identified by Rutherford (1897). 

1.3.1  Production of atmospheric ions 
Radon-222  decay  products  emitted  from  the  soil  are  important  contributors  to 

ionisation  at  the  land surface. One alpha-particle from radon typically has an energy 
of  4 MeV,  and  since  the  average  ionisation  energy  is  around  35 eV,  each  Œ±-particle 
will produce about 105 ion pairs (Isra¬∫l, 1971). The differing chemical composition of 

negative  ions  reduces  the  mean  number  of  water  molecules  attached  to  the  central 

cation.  Consequently,  negative ions  are  slightly  smaller  than  positive,  and can move 

faster  in  an  electric  field.  A  schematic  diagram  of  the  atmospheric  ion  production 

mechanism is given in Figure 1.1.

Ions in the atmosphere 

Cosmic  rays  are  high-energy  particles  from  outside  the  solar  system  which  cause 

about 20 % of the ionisation at ground level. (However the ionising potential of one 

such particle, typically moving at a sub-relativistic velocity, will clearly vastly exceed 

that of a single alpha-particle resulting from terrestrial radioactive decay.) The mean 

ion production rate is subject to considerable variability, but an accepted value for the 
long-term  mean  is  10  pairs cm-3 s-1  (Chalmers,  1967).  The  number  of  ions  increases 

with  altitude  as  the  relative  contribution  of  cosmic  rays  to  ionisation  increases,  and 

their  intensity.  Other,  less  significant  sources  of  atmospheric  ions  are  corona  ions 

from large electrical fields (e.g. those found below high voltage power lines). Ions can 

also be produced from the breaking of water droplets, leading to larger concentrations 

near to waterfalls and at the seashore (Chalmers, 1967). 

1.3.2  Size and composition of atmospheric small ions 
N2

+, N+ and O+ are the main primary ions produced from ionisation of the most 

+, O2

common  gases  in  the  atmosphere.  It  is  energetically  favourable  for  the  ions  to  react 

very  quickly  with  water.  The  time  constant  of  this  reaction,  when  water  molecules 
complex around the primary ions, is rapid5 and is proportional to the humidity of the 

air  (Keesee  and  Castleman,  1985).  The  most  common  anions  and  cations  in  the 
-(HNO3)n  where  n < 10  (Keesee  and  Castleman, 
troposphere  are  H+(H2O)n  and  NO3

1985), although mass spectrometric studies have shown that a wide variety of ions can 

exist,  including  organic  species  such  as  amines  and  pyridines  (Eisele,  1988,  1989). 

Typically,  these  molecular  cluster  ions  are  about  0.5 nm  in  radius,  with  a  mass  of  a 

few  hundred  atomic  mass  units  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al,  1999).  Pruppacher  and  Klett  (1998) 

state  that  the  mean  velocity  attained  by  a  particle  with  one  elementary  charge,  and 
radius 1 ¬µm in a typical atmospheric electrical field of 100 Vm-1 is 10-7 ms-1, which is 

insignificant  in  comparison  to  ambient  air  motion.  Air  ions  carry  one  unit  charge 

concentrated  over  a  smaller  volume,  and  the  electrical  and  mechanical  forces  acting 

on  them  are  comparable.  Therefore,  in  an  electric  field,  ions  are  influenced  by 

electrical forces at least as much as mechanical ones. 

1.3.3  Mobility of atmospheric small ions 
The  concept  of  electrical  mobility,  ¬µ  is  useful  to  describe  the  behaviour  of 

atmospheric  small  ions,  because  there  is  a  linear  relationship  between  it  and  the

magnitude  of  the  electric  force  acting  on  the  ions.  It  was  first  defined  by  Thomson 

(1928) as 

 

vd=¬µ  
E

(here written in scalar form) where E is the magnitude of the electric field and vd the 

associated  drift  velocity  attained  by  the  charged  particle  when in the Stokes r√ògime, 

(i.e. when the electrostatic forces acting on the particle balance the drag forces). Small 
ions  have a  relatively  high mobility  (typically 1 cm2V-1s-1)6. Other, larger ions  exist, 

but  their  electrical  mobilities  are  several  orders  of  magnitude  less  than  the  typical 

clusters comprising a small ion, so their contribution to the bulk electrical properties 

of  air  ions  is  negligible.  It  is  helpful  to  be  able  to  relate  ion  mobility  to  radius,  as 

shown  in  Figure  1.2.  This  problem  is  non-trivial  because  of  the  size-dependent 

interplay between different forces and effects.

1.4  Ions in the global atmospheric electrical circuit 

Ions  are  important  in  the  maintenance  of  the  global  atmospheric  electric  circuit,  a 

schematic  diagram  of  which  is  shown  in  Figure  1.3.  At  the  upper  levels  of  the 

atmosphere, ionisation is extensive and there is a layer of conductive air known as the 
ionosphere7. Strictly, the atmospheric current density J is defined by 

J œÉ=
E

 

where  œÉ is the air conductivity and  E the atmospheric electric field. The conduction 

current  is  calculated  over  the  entire  planet,  and  directly  results  from  the  electrical 

conductivity  due  to  air  ions.  The  magnitude  of  the  fair  weather  current  density  is 

small  compared  to  the  typical  current  of  1 A  delivered  by  each  thunderstorm.  The 

global circuit exists due to the approximate equality between the global fair weather 

current and the thunderstorm current, when compared on the planetary scale.

the electrosphere. The differences between them are discussed by MacGorman and Rust (1998).

1.5  Measurement of atmospheric small ions 

Small  ions  can  be  measured  by  exploiting  their  electrical  properties  such  as 

electrostatic  attraction.  The  simplest  way  of  counting  atmospheric  ions  is  to  subject 

them to an electric  field, for example by  blowing air between two metallic plates or 

into a conducting cylinder with a central electrode. If an electric field is applied across 

the  electrodes,  ions  will  be  electrostatically  attracted  to  them.  Therefore  this 

configuration  can  be  considered  to  store  charge,  and  is  referred  to  as  a  capacitor or 

condenser.  If  the  air-spaced  capacitor  is  charged  up  to  some  voltage  and  the  charge 

allowed to decay, the rate of decay through air will be related to the ion concentration. 

Alternatively, a current can be measured which is proportional to the concentration of 

air ions and their electrical mobility. As small ions are singly charged, this enables the 

air conductivity to be determined. 

 

 

Chapter 1 

 

25 

Ions in the atmosphere 

Gerdien (1905) first used such a cylindrical capacitor to measure air conductivity. The 

Gerdien condenser has become the classic instrument for air ion measurement, albeit 

in  a  different  configuration  to  the  one  Gerdien  (1905)  originally  proposed.  Initially, 

the  conductivity  was  inferred  from  the  rate  of  decay  of  the  voltage  across  the 

capacitor‚Äôs  electrodes,  but  this  technique  has  fallen  almost  completely  out  of  use  in 

modern  implementations.  This  is  unfortunate,  because  measuring  a  rate  of  voltage 

decay is far simpler than attempting to resolve the very small ion current at the central 
electrode  (of  order  10-13 A).  It  is  also  difficult  to  understand  why  one  of  the  two 

methods  of  ion  counting  with  the  Gerdien  condenser  should  be  so  favoured,  when 

corroboratory  measurements  can  be  obtained  with  the  same  instrument  operating  in 

both modes.  

An additional application of the Gerdien condenser is that varying the electric field in 

the condenser allows selection of different mobilities of ions. This enables resolution 

of  spectral  information  about  the  ion  population;  although  relatively  simple  in 

principle, such measurements are rare. Modern electronic and computer technology is 

infrequently  applied  to  exploit  the  self-corroborating  and  spectral  measurement 

properties of the Gerdien instrument. There is clearly scope for modernisation of this 

classical  instrument  to  measure  ion  mobility  spectra,  and  to  utilise  both  methods  of 

conductivity measurement.  

1.6  Motivation 

Many of the primary motivations to improve instrumentation for investigating air ions 

can  be  traced  back  to  the  earlier  summary  of  Rutherford  (1897).  Rutherford‚Äôs 

observation  that  small  ions  to  attach  to  aerosol  particles  has  developed  into  a 

hypothesis that air conductivity can be used as a pollution indicator, both on a secular 

and local scale. Although theoretically  sound,  the  dependency of air conductivity on 

the  aerosol  concentration  has  not  been  shown  to  be  universally  valid.  One  of  the 

motivations for improving air ion measurements is to test the precept that conductivity 

is generally useful as a pollution indicator. 

Rutherford‚Äôs comments summarised early perceptions of atmospheric particulates. His 

conceptualisations  have  been  developed  throughout the  century into  viewing ions  as 

Chapter 1 

 

26 

 

 

 

Ions in the atmosphere 

part of the atmospheric aerosol spectrum8; this provokes further study of ion-aerosol 

interactions.  If  ions  are  viewed  as  part  of  the  aerosol  spectrum,  then  the  study  of 

atmospheric aerosol encompasses the study of atmospheric ions. All the motivations 

to measure aerosol (discussed above) apply directly to air ions and motivate the study 

of air ions in their own right. 

More specifically, ions have been implicated in aerosol particle formation, but this has 

not  yet  been  observed  directly  in  the  atmosphere,  though  there  is  increasingly  a 

theoretical  framework  providing  a  plausible  atmospheric  mechanism  (Turco  et  al, 

1998; Yu and Turco, 2000). There  is  a controversy about the r(cid:244)le of ions in aerosol 
formation, with two rival theories, one of which does not involve atmospheric ions9. 

Measuring  atmospheric  ion  growth  processes  will  clearly  be  expedient  in  resolving 

these issues. 

The  Gerdien  condenser  is  a  classical  instrument,  which  can  measure  both  air 

conductivity  and  atmospheric  ion  spectra.  It  is  capable  of  air  ion  measurements  by 

two  methods,  although  few  attempts  have  been  made  to  compare  the  two  operating 

modes.  A  combination  of  the  two  ion  measurement  methodologies  using  the  same 

sampling  instrument  would  be  a  powerful,  and  novel,  way  to  check  its  self-

consistency.  In  particular,  it  is  hypothesised  that  the  measurement  of  voltage decays 

from  the  Gerdien  instrument  can  be  mechanised  and  used  to  make  systematic 

measurements at the ground in conjunction with the direct measurement of current at 

the  central  electrode.  This,  in  combination  with  ion mobility spectra, would provide 

reason to trust the detailed measurements which will be required to detect ion-assisted 

 

 

 

particle formation.

the  atmosphere,  with  particular  emphasis  on  surface  measurements.  Chapter  2

theory  relating  them  to  other  aspects  of  atmospheric  physics.  The  design  and 

components of a modernised Gerdien ion counter are investigated in Chapter 3, and it

In this section the scientific r(cid:244)le of atmospheric ion measurements is discussed. The 

historical  motivation  and  development  of  instrumentation,  with  typical  results  are 

described  in  Sections  2.1  to  2.4.  The  remainder  of  the  chapter  discusses  modern 

applications  of  air  ion  measurements,  in  particular  air ion mobility  spectra and their 

relevance. Section 2.7 describes a recent and important motivation for further study of 

air ions. 

2.1  Historical introduction 

The first publication directly related to air ions was by Zeleny (1898). Research into 

the  subject  became  popular  in  the  early  years  of  this  century:  it  was  predominantly 

concentrated  in  the  Cavendish  Laboratory  at  Cambridge  but  also  in  the  US  and 

Germany.  Initially,  work  on  air  ions  was  not  initially  motivated  by  questions  in 

atmospheric  science,  (e.g.  Rutherford,  1897;  McClelland,  1898),  but  a  tendency  has 

developed during this century towards viewing ions as part of the atmospheric aerosol 

spectrum. 

Ions  were  first  identified  by  Faraday  in  his  nineteenth  century  studies  of 

electrochemistry,  and  were  known  to  be  produced  by  some  sort  of  breakdown  of 

molecules  in  an  electric  field.  Helmholtz  developed  this  work  to  define  the  electric 

charge on the atom as the finite quantity of electricity carried by all ions. Stoney then 

used  the  word  (cid:147)electron(cid:148)  for  the  first  time  to  describe  a  fundamental  amount  of 

electricity (Robotti, 1995). J.J. Thomson identified the constituents of cathode rays as 

the  first  sub-atomic  particles,  which  he  called  (cid:147)corpuscles(cid:148),  at  the  Cavendish 
Laboratory in 189711. Ernest Rutherford and C.T.R. Wilson were taken on as research 

students  in  the  1890s.  Although  they  ultimately  became  famous  outside  this  field,

both  men  produced  valuable  work  related  to  air  ions  during  this  period  at  the 

Cavendish  Laboratory.  In  particular,  whilst  still  a  student,  C.T.R.  Wilson  (1897) 

developed  his  cloud  chamber,  in  order  to  investigate  particle  formation  from  air 
ions12.  Roentgen(cid:146)s  discovery  of  X-rays  (1896)  was  timely  for  research  into  ions  in 

gases, since (cid:147)Roentgen  rays(cid:148) were soon found to make gases electrically conductive 

by  ionisation.  The  conductivity  of  atmospheric  air  was  explicitly  attributed  to  the 

presence  of  molecular  cluster-ions  by  Elster  and  Geitel  in  1901  (Torreson,  1949; 

Schonland, 1953). 

 

2.2  Overview of the Gerdien method 

2.2.1  Principles of the Gerdien Condenser 
Zeleny  (1898)  measured  the  mobilities  of  air  ions  using  a  ventilated  cylinder,  as 

shown in Figure 2.1.  A section of the airflow was ionised with a radioactive source, 

and the ion present were attracted to wire gauze by an electric field. The wire gauze 

was  connected  to  an  electrometer,  to  measure  the  ions.  Zeleny  (1898)  found  that 

negative ions needed a larger potential difference to be deflected by the same amount 

as  the  positive  ions.  This  implied  that  the  negative  ions  had  a  higher  velocity,  and 

hence mobility (see Eq. 1.1) than positive ions. 

                                                           
12 This won Wilson the Nobel Prize in 1927 after the cloud chamber had been applied to measure sub-
atomic particles.

at  D,  pass  through  a  plug  of  wire  wool,  to  remove  (cid:147)dust(cid:148),  and  leave  at  F.  O  is  an 

ionising X-ray source. Q and P are brass plates with a voltage across them. T and K 

are wire gauze.  If the ions produced  hit  P, Q  or  K they  are conducted  to earth, but 

ions  hitting  T  modify  its  potential,  which  is  measured  relative  to  the  battery  by  the 

electrometer E (Thomson, 1928). 

In  1905  Gerdien  developed  a  device  which  has  become  the  standard  instrument  for 

measuring air conductivity. The eponymous Gerdien condenser will be referred to as 

a  "Gerdien"  in  this  chapter.  It  is  made  of  two  coaxial  electrodes,  a  hollow  cylinder 

known  as  the  outer  electrode  containing  a  thinner  central  electrode  (which  is 

frequently  a  solid  wire).  This  configuration  has  a  finite  capacitance,  which  can  be 

theoretically  derived  from  Gauss‚Äô  Law,  and  is  therefore  frequently  referred  to  as  a 

"condenser"  (Swann,  1914).    If  a  potential  is  applied  across  the  electrodes  and  the 

tube is ventilated, then air ions of the same sign as the voltage are repelled from the 

outer  electrode  and attracted  to the central electrode. If they meet it, a small current 

flows, which is proportional to the ion concentration and electrical conductivity of the 

 

air.

Figure 2.2 Schematic of a Gerdien condenser 

 
Early Gerdiens were substantially proportioned, with linear dimensions of about 8 cm 

by 50 cm (Torreson, 1949).  This  was necessary in order for the output current to be 

large  enough  to  be  resolved  by  contemporary  electrometers.  In  the  1950s  smaller 

tubes  were  developed  for  radiosonde  measurements,  which  were  typically  of  order 

5 cm in diameter and 30 cm in length. Attaching the Gerdien to a fixed potential, and 

allowing the voltage to decay through air permits a voltage to be measured rather than 

the  current  from  the  central  electrode.  This  is  preferential  for  conductivity 

measurement  on  radiosondes,  because  it  is  more  straightforward  to  measure  voltage 

than small currents, and immensely simplifies the issues associated with electrometry. 

The  smaller  sized  tube  was  not  problematic  when  ion  currents  did  not  have  to  be 

directly measured. Recent improvements in electronics have improved measurements 

of  very  small  currents  in  the  femtoampere  range  (Harrison,  1997a;  Harrison  and 

Aplin, 2000a).  

 

The most common of the varied materials used to make Gerdien condensers has been 

brass  (e.g.  Higazi  and  Chalmers,  1966;  Brownlee,  1973)  probably  following 

successful use of this material by early investigators (e.g. Rutherford, 1897). Gerdiens 

designed  for  use  on  radiosondes  have necessarily been made of less dense materials 

such  as  aluminium  or  aluminised  paper  (Hatakayema  et  al,  1958;  Venkiteshwaran, 

1958).  The  tube  material  could  be  significant  for  two  reasons:  firstly  that  of  its 

durability when used in the field, and secondly that of the effect of contact potential. 

Chapter 2 

 

32 

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

W(cid:229)hlin  (1986)  discusses  the  effect  of  the  material  of  the  tube,  opining  that  contact 

potentials  cause  offsets  in  the  i-V  response.  This  is  credible,  as  two  electrodes 

touching a fluid containing ions do make an electrochemical cell (e.g. Atkins, 1989), 

even  if  the  electrolyte  (air)  is  dilute.  According  to  W(cid:229)hlin  (1986),  a  Gerdien  will 

measure  a  non-zero  current  when  the  bias  voltage  is  zero,  due  to  electrochemical 

potential at the surface of the tube. W(cid:229)hlin (1986) suggests that a steel tube has to be 

biased at about 0.4 V and the aluminium at 1 V to counteract this. However, he does 

not  explain  how  the  effects  of  tube  material  alone  were  distinguished  in  his 

experiments from the many other sources of offset associated with Gerdien condenser 

measurements.  The  effect  of  different  tube  materials  has  not  been  systematically 

investigated,  but  Hatakayema  et  al  (1958)  did  apply  an  offset  of  -140 mV 

corresponding  to  the  contact  potential  for  their  aluminium  tube,  though  they  do  not 

explain how this quantity was obtained. 

2.2.2  Calculating conductivity from Gerdien condenser measurements  
Chalmers (1967) explains the fundamentals of conductivity (œÉ) measurement from the 

rate  of  decay  of  charge  Q,  carried  by  a  capacitor  of  surface  area  SA,  through  a 

medium. Gauss‚Äô Law states that the charge per unit area is proportional to the electric 

field, which is (from Eq. 1.3) proportional to the current density J, given by 

hence the current i, for a flow of negative ions from a positively charged body is  

Since current i is equal to the rate of change of charge dQ/dt, Eq. 2.2 is a differential

This indicates that the charge will  decay exponentially  with  time t from the  original 

value Q0. In terms of conductivity measurement, the rate of decay is related to the ion 

concentration. By analogy with the expression for exponential decay of charge from a 

capacitor (e.g. Duffin, 1980), it is clear that conductivity is inversely proportional to 
the time constant œÑ of the decay,

(e.g. Duffin, 1980). It is clear from Eq. 2.4. and Eq. 2.5 that the conductivity can be 

determined  by  measuring  the  time  constant  of  the  voltage  decay  from  the  capacitor 

As  in  the  direct  ion  current  measurement  method,  the  ions  entering  the  Gerdien 

condenser  which  are  the  same  sign  as  the  voltage  are  repelled  towards  the  central 

electrode. The sign of the ions measured in this way is the same as the applied voltage 
(Venkiteshwaran,  1958;  MacGorman  and  Rust, 199813). The measurements  differ in 

the instrumentation used to sense the motion of the ions, and are therefore called the 

Voltage Decay and Current Measurement modes in this Thesis. 

The  Voltage  Decay  mode  was  the  method  originally  proposed  for  conductivity 

measurement by Gerdien (1905), and although subsequently discussed (Swann, 1914), 

it  seems  to  have  been  largely  neglected  until  conductivity  measurements  on 

radiosondes  were  made  by  Hatakayema  et  al  (1958),  Venkiteshwaran  (1958)  and 

Rosen  et al (1982). This neglect is surprising, given that conductivity measurements 

made  by  the  two  methods  would  be  extremely  useful  to  check  self-consistency, 

especially as there is no absolute calibration technique for Gerdien condensers.  

Conductivity  by  the  Current  Measurement  mode  can  be  derived  by  considering  the 

electric field in the Gerdien condenser, as in MR (1998). If a and b are the radii of the 

outer and central electrodes of a Gerdien, V the voltage across the electrodes, and r a 

radius  from  the  central  axis  of  the  outer  electrode  as  in  Figure 2.2, then the electric 

field for a cylinder of infinite length is calculated from Gauss(cid:146) Law

In this time, if the air is moving at a speed u, then the distance it moves is ut. If ut is 

less than the length of the tube L then all the ions are collected when 

From  this  a  minimum  mobility  of  ion  can  be  defined,  the  critical  mobility  which  is 

collected by the central electrode whilst in the tube. This definition is subject to error 

since  Eq.  2.7  for  electric  field  in  the  tube  assumed it was infinite in length, and the 

Gerdien  is too short for end effects to be ignored. Substituting in the expression for 
mobility (Eq. 1.1) then the critical mobility ¬µc can be defined as 

The  theory  detailed  above  assumes  that  ions  take  a  parabolic  path  in  the  tube.  In 

reality  the  ions  enter  the  tube  at  a  distribution  of  angles,  and  a  few  can  thus  be 

collected  even  if  they  are  slightly  below  the  critical  mobility.  The  error  from  this 

source is likely to be much smaller than those introduced by measurement errors.  

The current arriving at the central electrode per unit time is defined in MR (1998) as

This removes some of the error ensuing from the Gauss(cid:146)s Law assumption, due to the 

end effects of the Gerdien tube (Chalmers, 1967). Repulsion of ions of the same sign 

as the outer electrode towards the central electrode ensures that bipolar conductivity 

of  the  same  sign  as  the  bias  voltage  is  measured.  This  equation  is  used  to  calibrate 

current measurements from a Gerdien condenser to obtain bipolar conductivity. Total 

conductivity is defined as the sum of the bipolar conductivities

When conductivity measurements are made with a Gerdien condenser they will vary 

with  the  bias  voltage  used  and  the  dimensions  of  the  tube  according  to  Ohm(cid:146)s  law. 

However,  different  bias  voltages  and  physically  different  tubes  will  have  different 

critical mobilities, and therefore measure different fractions of the ion spectrum. The 

variety  of  atmospheric  ion  species  (e.g.  Keesee  and  Castleman,  1985)  suggests  that 

there  is  a  non-unimodal  ion  spectrum,  so  measurements  made  at  one  bias  voltage 

might  be  affected  by  the  whole  ion  spectrum.  Conductivity  measurements  made  at 

other  bias  voltages  may  have  only  a  small  fraction  of  ions  contributing  to  the

measurement.  Caution  must  therefore  be  exercised  when  comparing  conductivity 

measurements made with different instruments. 

There is a need to redefine conductivity as an average property of air ions, with the 

number  concentration  as  the  average  over  the  whole  mobility  spectrum.  If  the  ion 

spectrum  is  not  measured  at  the  same  time  as  the  conductivity,  the  best  estimate  is 

possibly  to  take  the  critical  mobility  to  be  the  average  for  small  ions,  so  that  a 

significant fraction of the spectrum is observed.  

The  concept  of  a  Gerdien  condenser  as  an  instrument  to  measure  air  ions  is  well-

established, but the theory of its operation is explored in inadequate detail, resting on 

many  assumptions  about  the  nature  of  the  ions  it  measures.  The  capacity  of  the 

Gerdien  to  measure  air  ions  by  two  independent  methods  could  easily  have  been 

exploited, particularly in the absence of absolute calibration techniques. Yet this has 

been profoundly neglected in the hundred-year history of the instrument.

measurements  over  land  show  a  peak  just  before  sunrise,  caused  by  the  nocturnal 

inversion  trapping  air  near  to  the  surface  in  which  natural  radioactive  gases  such  as 

radon can build up and increase the ionisation rate (Wait and Parkinson, 1945), shown 

in  Figure  2.3.  The  conductivity  decreases  mid-morning,  because  turbulent  mixing 

becomes more significant and disperses the radioactive gases that ionise the air. For 

the  rest  of  the  day  the  conductivity  measurements  are  more  dependent  on  the  local 

conditions. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 2.3 Typical diurnal variation of conductivity measured at Kew, from Chalmers 

(1967) 

In  clean-air  regions  of  the  world,  the  conductivity  trace  tends  to  match  the  diurnal 

variation of ionisation rate well. Other factors, primarily the presence of aerosol, can 

also  influence  the  local  ion  concentration.  Insight  into  factors  governing  the  ion 

concentration  n  (and  hence  conductivity  by  Eq.  2.14)  can  be  obtained  from  the  ion 

balance equation in its simplest, steady-state form, where q is the ionisation rate, Z the 
monodisperse  aerosol  number  concentration,  and  Œ±  and  Œ≤  are  the  ionic  and  self-

recombination and attachment coefficients:

When  conductivity  varies  with  the  ionisation  rate,  this  implies  that  the  aerosol  term 

must  be  negligible,  as  it  would  otherwise  modulate  the  ion  concentration.  This  is 

known as the recombination limit (Clement and Harrison, 1992) when

If the aerosol term dominates, this is referred to as the attachment limit, because of the 

effect  of  small  ions  attaching  to  larger  aerosol  particles. In this limit conductivity is

less  clearly  related  to  the  ionisation  rate  as  in  Retalis  et  al  (1991)  and  Guo  et  al  

(1996). These measurements were made in polluted areas, and also showed the lowest 
mean values of conductivity with œÉt ‚âà 8 fSm-1. Conductivity can also vary with local 

meteorology  affecting  dispersion  of  aerosol,  as  in  Figure  2.3.  These  measurements 

were  made  in  the  1930(cid:146)s  when  there  were  frequent  London  smogs,  when  aerosol 

emissions became trapped near the ground in winter, and insolation was insufficient 
to substantially mix the air and disperse the aerosol14.  

Conductivity  measurements  over  the  ocean  (Kamra  and  Deshpande,  1995)  show  a 

much  smaller  diurnal  variation.  Over  the  ocean,  q  is  low,  since  there  are  no  natural 

radioactive emissions from the sea. However, ion concentrations remain similar to the 

land because of the reduced aerosol concentration, which attenuates the conductivity 

over  land.  The  effects  of  human  activity  on  conductivity  over  the  ocean  are  also 

minimal, though detectable and are discussed further in Section 2.5.

electrical  circuit;  in  fair  weather  negative  ions  move  upwards  and  positive 

downwards. Near to the ground the motion of the positive ions is constrained, so there 

is a build-up of positive charged particles (MR, 1998). Although the existence of the 

electrode  effect  was  posited  from  purely  electrical  arguments,  micrometeorological 

factors  are  also  vital  in understanding the motion of charged particles in the surface 

layer (Barlow, 2000).  x is known to tend to unity as the wind speed increases, owing 

to  increased  turbulent  mixing  (Higazi  and  Chalmers,  1966;  Retalis  et  al,  1991) 

reducing the asymmetry from the electrode effect.  

 

An increase in the relative humidity is thought to cause a decrease in the conductivity 

resulting  from  the  increased  hydration  of  air  ions  with  water  molecules,  which 

decreases their mobility and hence the conductivity. In extreme cases, ions attach to 

water  droplets,  resulting  in  a  more  pronounced  decrease  in  conductivity.  This  has 

been  suggested  as  a  technique  to  predict  fog  formation,  and  is  reviewed  by  van  der 

Hage  and  de  Bruin  (1999).  According  to  van  der  Hage  and  de  Bruin  (1999),  this 

method  is  successful  in  clean  marine  environments,  but  in  urban  environments  the 
presence  of  aerosol  tends  to  perturb  the  expected  relationship15.  Kamra  et  al  (1997) 

measured conductivity over the ocean, where there is little variability in the ionisation 

rate  relative  to  over  land,  and  concluded that an increase in the relative humidity of 

10-20 %  caused  the  conductivity  to  decrease  by  a  factor  of  two.  In  a  thorough 

laboratory  investigation,  Moore  and  Vonnegut  (1988)  showed  that  the  conductivity 

over  boiling  water  was  half  its  value  compared  to  dry  air  with  a  relative 

humidity of 20 %.  Harrison  (1992)  calculated  relative  concentrations  of  different 
hydrations of the common atmospheric ion H+(H2O)n by extrapolating thermodynamic 

data obtained from mass spectrometry. According to these calculations, at 300 K for a 

change  in  relative humidity from 20 % to 100 % the mean mobility should decrease 
from  2.05 x 10-4 to  1.74 x 10-4 m2V-1s-1,  i.e.  a  factor  of  17 %.  The  discrepancy 

between  the  theoretical  and  experimental  values  is  to  be  expected,  since  the  mean 

mobility  of  atmospheric  ions  (Mohnen,  1974)  implies  that  other,  more  massive,  air 

ions exist as well as the hydronium species, and extrapolation of thermodynamic data 

beyond  the  experimental  conditions  may  be  problematic.  However,  the  trend  of  the 

                                                           
15 It is difficult, however, to understand how such a traditionally (cid:147)fair weather(cid:148) instrument such as the 
Gerdien,  which  is  susceptible  to  stray  currents  from  condensation  and  across  insulators,  could  be 
trusted to measure conductivity accurately in fog.

decreases the mean mobility. 

2.3  Fair weather measurements at altitude 

Many  balloon-borne  measurements  of  the  conductivity  profile  have  been  made  (e.g. 

Woessner  et  al,  1958;  Rosen  et  al,  1982;  Gringel,  1979;  Gringel  et  al,  1983). 

However these studies can be viewed critically for their lack of a systematic approach. 

For  example,  the  synoptic  situation  may  affect  the  ion  concentration  significantly, 

since a marine air mass may contain more ions and fewer aerosol, and continental air 

masses from different sources may contain varying amounts of aerosol. In the above 

papers,  no  attempt  was  made  to  analyse  the  data  with  respect  to  the  meteorological 

conditions and hence only general conclusions can be drawn. 

The  over-riding  characteristic  is  an  increase  in  conductivity  with  altitude  for  two 

significant  reasons:  in  the  first  6 km  of  the  atmosphere,  the  aerosol  concentration 

drops exponentially with height, and in the troposphere it is significantly lower than in 

the boundary layer (Pruppacher and Klett, 1997). Incoming cosmic rays are also more 

intense at higher altitudes, so the ion production increases with height. The latter point 

explains  the  greater  rate  of  increase,  and  lower  variability,  of  conductivity  observed 
above  about  13 km.  The  classic  expression  for  the  variation  of  conductivity  œÉ  with 

height z (in km) is quoted in MKS units in MR (1998), but was originally derived by 

Woessner et al (1958):

Figure 2.5 Variation of conductivity with altitude from Eq. 2.21 and Eq. 2.22, derived 

by Woessner et al (1958). 

 

Woessner  et  al  (1958),  measured  conductivity  with  Gerdien  condensers  suspended 

below  balloons  and  operating  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode,  as  shown  in  Figure  2.5. 

Woessner  et  al(cid:146)s  (1958)  expressions  (Eq.  2.21  and  Eq.  2.22)  are  derived  from  a 

theoretical  consideration  of  ionisation  by  cosmic  rays  only,  and  the  coefficients  are 

obtained  empirically  from  measurements.  Positive  conductivity  at  ground  level  is 
predicted to be 42 fSm-1, which is about a factor of four higher than the average value. 

If only cosmic rays were being considered, conductivity would be under-predicted at 

ground level, however Woessner et al(cid:146)s model (1958) does not include the effect of 

aerosol,  which  significantly  attenuates  the  ion  concentration.  In  the  boundary  layer, 

natural  radioactivity  contributes  to  much  of  the  ionisation,  and  the  aerosol 

concentration  is  variable;  these  factors  preclude  accurate  prediction  of  conductivity 

based on Woessner et al(cid:146)s (1958) criteria. Gringel (1978) also measured conductivity, 

by  current  measurement,  and  compared  results  between  solar  maximum  and  solar 

minimum.  He  calculated  empirical  expressions  for  the  variation  of  positive 

conductivity with height, which were of the form

where  the  coefficients  change  depending  on  the  solar  cycle.  Gringel(cid:146)s  (1978) 

expression is plotted in Figure 2.6 below. Since Gringel(cid:146)s expressions are completely 

empirical and based on radiosonde ascents from the ground, they include the effect of 

aerosol  and  therefore  predict  conductivity  more  effectively  at  ground  level  than 

Woessner et al (1958). The conductivity is lower at solar maximum because the Sun(cid:146)s 

increased magnetic field is more effective at deflecting the lower energy cosmic rays 

away from the Earth(cid:146)s atmosphere, hence there is less ionisation, the difference being 

most  pronounced  at  higher  altitudes.  Positive  conductivity  averaged  over  both  solar 
cycles at z = 1 m is 27 fSm-1, which concurs with other ground-based measurements. 

Woessner  et  al  (1958)  made  their  measurements  between  September  1956 and June 

1957  which  was  at  a  period  of  solar  maximum,  which  agree  well  with  Gringel(cid:146)s

walls, and electrically produced errors (Anderson and Bailey, 1991). Repulsion at the

disturbance  caused  by  the  tube  in  the  local  electric  field,  has  been  recognised.  This 

can be removed by keeping the inlet at local atmospheric potential to minimise such 

perturbations  (Higazi  and  Chalmers,  1966;  Anderson  and  Bailey,  1991).  This 

technique is known as guarding, (Horowitz and Hill, 1994) and whilst worthwhile to 

reduce  leakage  currents  and  field  perturbations,  it  requires  additional  driving  and 

measurement circuitry.  

Anderson  and  Bailey  (1991)  carried  out  a  detailed  study  of  the  losses  of  ions  by 

diffusion. They calculated expressions for the losses to the tube walls from theoretical 

expressions  and  previous  conductivity  measurements.  The  fraction  of  ions  n/no 
collected depends on the tube diameter d, flow rate Œ¶ and tube length L:

(c  is  a  dimensionless  constant:  for  positive  ions  c = -3.8 x 10-3,  for  negative  ions

have a noticeable effect, but Higazi and Chalmers (1966) reported that this produced a 

15-20 % error. Another expression is cited in Hƒ±rrak et al (2000) specifically for one

This  suggests  that  Eq.  2.24  may not be directly applicable for all geometries, which 

may  explain  the  differing  results  of  Higazi  and  Chalmers  (1966).  Anderson  and 

Bailey (1991) unfortunately neglect to state the dependence of Eq. 2.24 on geometry. 

Since  the  determination  of  the  conductivity  from Gerdiens by current measurements 

clearly depends on the tube capacitance (Eq. 2.16), the value of the capacitance used 

and its accuracy are important, but not easy to determine due to stray capacitances e.g. 

in connecting leads. Calculation of the capacitance from Gauss(cid:146)s Law for an infinitely 

long  cylindrical  condenser  is  not  appropriate  because  end  effects  introduce  a 

substantial  error.  Smith  (1953)  describes  a  method  to  find  the  capacitance  of  a 

Gerdien  by  comparing  measurements  made  with  and  without  the  central  electrode

present.  It  is  of  concern  that  the  method  of  capacitance  determination  and  the 

uncertainty are rarely cited, but it is apparent that Smith(cid:146)s (1953) method has become 

fairly  common  (MR,  1998).  Blakeslee  (1984)  used  a  similar  technique  to  Smith  by 

applying  a  20  kHz  signal  across  the  outer  electrode  and  ground,  with  an  alternating 

current (ac) voltmeter between the central electrode and ground, and tuned the circuit 

with a variable capacitor to give the same output after the central electrode had been 

removed. Although Blakeslee (1984) proves that the change in the variable capacitor 

is  equivalent  to  the  capacitance  with  the  central  electrode  present,  he  gives  no 

indication of the uncertainty. Blakeslee and Krider (1992) state that the capacitance of 

their Gerdien is "about 6.2 pF", suggesting that their technique for measuring it was 

approximate. The capacitance is usually the largest source of error in the calibration 

process.  In  Aplin  and  Harrison  (2000)  the  relaxation  time  technique  used  has  an 

associated error of about 20 %. However, since the development of a new calibrator 

based  on  a  precision  voltage  ramp  delivered  to  a  capacitor  (Harrison  and  Aplin, 
2000a), this problem has considerably diminished17. 

Moody (1981) believes that (cid:147)ion-induced noise(cid:148) is a significant problem with Gerdien 

condenser  measurements.  This  apparently  results  from  the  impaction  of  oppositely 

charged particles to those being measured on to the Gerdien(cid:146)s electrodes, which can 
cause noise if the timescale of the fluctuations greatly exceeds the time constant œÑ of 

 

 

the electrometer  

RC=œÑ

 

Eq. 2.26 

where R is the resistance and C the capacitance across the electrometer. For the values 
cited  by  Moody  (1981)  œÑ  is  0.3-3 s.  Moody  (1981,  1984)  designed  a  tri-electrode 

Gerdien  with  a  grid  electrode  between  the  outer  and  central  electrodes  to  solve  the 

problem. However, he does not state how he was able to separate the effects of "ion-

induced noise" from the other sources of noise or uncertainty in his measurements, or 

indeed  speculate  on  what  they  might  be.  (cid:147)Ion-induced  noise(cid:148)  is  only  thought  to  be 

significant if the concentration of one sign of ion exceeds the other by a few orders of 

magnitude. The maximum measured atmospheric ion asymmetry ratio is only of order 

10  (MR,  1998),  so  if  Moody(cid:146)s  (cid:147)ion-induced  noise(cid:148)  does  exist,  it  is  unlikely  to  be 

relevant to measurements in atmospheric air.

2.5  Air conductivity and aerosol pollution 

Rutherford  (1897)  was  the  first  to  propose  the  idea  that  larger  particles  reduce  the 

number of small ions by attachment. This behaviour explains the difference between 

the  conductivity  in  clean  air  and  urban  locations,  and  the  lack  of  dependency  of 

conductivity on the ionisation rate in polluted regions. Since the new charged aerosol 

particle  produced  by  attachment  is  much  bigger  than  the  original  small  ion,  its 

mobility  is  orders  of  magnitude  smaller,  which  reduces  air(cid:146)s  electrical  conductivity. 

This  effect  was  first  observed  in  the  atmosphere  by  Wait  (1946),  who  formalised 

Rutherford(cid:146)s ideas following oceanic conductivity measurements on the cruises of the 

research  ship  Carnegie  (Chalmers,  1967)  from  1912  onwards.  The  fifty-year  delay 

between  Rutherford  (1897)  and  Wait  (1946)  may  have  been  because  the  concept  of 

secular change of air conductivity resulting from a global increase in pollution would, 

by definition, require many years to be established. It is arguably not established now, 

a  further fifty years on. To prove its existence, measurements need to be made over 

the ocean where the ionisation rate is not controlled by local radioactivity, and local 

effects  do  not  dominate  the  ion  concentration.  These  are  rare,  but  recent  results 

(Kamra and Deshpande, 1995) from a cruise in the Bay of Bengal, confirm that there 

has  been  a  secular  decrease  in  air  conductivity  this  century.  Kamra  and  Deshpande 

(1995) noted that there was a strong relationship between distance from the land, wind 

direction, and conductivity. Measurements of conductivity over the oceans are plotted 

below in Figure 2.7, although it is perhaps na(cid:239)ve to directly compare many sets of data 

made  with  different  instruments  under  different  conditions,  particularly  since  the 

previous measurements were made at different distances from landmasses. In the light 

of this, the concept of a secular decrease in conductivity this century has been neither 

corroborated nor refuted.

Figure  2.7  Comparison  of  total  conductivity  measurements  made  over  tropical 

oceans,  from  data  presented  in  Kamra  and  Deshpande  (1995).  Where  a  range  of 

conductivities has been given, the average has been plotted and the error bars are the 

range of values. If measurements were made over a period of more than one year (e.g. 

the Carnegie measurements were from 1911-1920) the average has been plotted. 

 

  

Attempts have also been made to quantify the relationship between air pollution and 

conductivity in urban areas. Retalis et al (1991) show there is a statistically significant 

negative trend in air conductivity at Athens from 1968-1980, and opine that there is a 

connection between this and increasing pollution; but no attempt is made to compare 

the  results  with  any  other  measurements,  this  can  therefore  remain  no  more  than 

speculation. Guo et al (1996) used two years(cid:146) data from Toronto in 1973-4 in order to 

analyse  correlations  between  total  conductivity  and  aerosol,  carbon  monoxide, 

sulphur  dioxide  and  nitrogen  dioxide.  They  found  negative  linear  correlations 

between  conductivity  and  all  the  pollutants,  but  the  best  correlation  (-0.46)  was 

between conductivity and aerosol.  

The  theoretical  relationship  between  conductivity  and  aerosol  concentration  can  be 

simply derived from the steady-state solution of the ion balance equation (Eq. 2.19), 

assuming a monodisperse aerosol population

Eq. 2.27. 

Eq.  2.27  shows  that  Guo  et  al(cid:146)s  (1996)  assumption  of  a  linear  model  between 

conductivity  and  aerosol  number  concentration  has  no  physical  basis  unless  the 
aerosol concentration is very high, so that Œ≤Z >> 4Œ±q in the ion balance equation (Eq. 

2.19). Although Guo et al (1996) did see an inverse correlation between conductivity 

and  aerosol,  it  is  regrettable  that  their  paper  was  accepted  for  publication  despite 

many  of  the  plots  having  no  units.  It  is  therefore  impossible  to  determine  any 

quantitative link between conductivity and aerosol concentration from their work. 

Guo  et  al  (1996)  were  motivated  to  investigate  the  correlation  of  conductivity  and 

gaseous pollutants because they (cid:147)reduce the ion productivity of the air(cid:148) with respect 
to  the  recombination  term  Œ±n2.  The  recombination  coefficient  Œ±  is  generally 

calculated  from  Thomson(cid:146)s  theory  (e.g.  Harrison,  1992),  which  is  based  on  the 

precept that two oppositely charged molecular ions will recombine if they are within a 

certain  distance  from  each  other,  and  when  a  third  molecule  enters  the  sphere  of 

influence, it will catalyse the recombination process. So the implication of Guo et al 

(1996)  must  be  understood  as  the  presence  of  extra  gaseous  pollutants  can  increase 

ionic  recombination.  This  is  an  unconventional  viewpoint,  but  as  some  negative 

correlation was seen between ions and gaseous pollutants the idea may warrant further 

investigation.  There  could  be  many  other  explanations  for  the  correlations,  for 

instance  if  aerosol  particle  formation  onto  ions  was  catalysed  by  these  trace  gases 

there  might  be  a  similar  relationship  between  the  trace  gases  and  conductivity. 

Perhaps  the  most  likely  explanation  is  that  gases  are  acting  as  a  proxy  for particles, 

since  sulphate  aerosol  is  initially  formed  from  sulphur  dioxide  (via  homogeneous 

nucleation, which will be explained in Section 2.7). If this is so then the correlation 

may  depend  on  the  timescale  of  the  measurement,  if  comparable  with  the  particle 

formation processes. Guo et al (1996) use long-term average measurements, so their 

results should be unaffected. 

Eq.  2.27  strongly  suggests  that  there  should  be  a  quantifiable  link  between  air 

pollution  and  the  electrical  conductivity  of  air.  It  is  commonly  proposed  that  this 

could potentially be useful as a proxy for aerosol measurement. However, Eq. 2.27 is

reliant on the assumption that air conductivity is only influenced by atmospheric small 

ions.  If  intermediate  or  large  ions  contribute  to  the  conductivity,  as  suggested  by 
Dhanorkar and Kamra (1997), then there is scope for a positive œÉ-Z correlation. There 

is  a  dearth  of  rigorous  work  investigating  the  relationship  between œÉ and Z,  but 

systematic measurements should be capable of at least clarifying the issue. 

 
2.6  Ion mobility spectrometry with a cylindrical condenser 

An  ionic  mobility  spectrum  describes  the  distribution  of  ions  across  different 

electrical  mobility  categories.  Since  mobility  is  inversely  related  to  ionic  mass  and 

radius  (Tammet,  1995),  then  mobility  spectra  can  be  a  powerful  way  to  investigate 

ionic  properties  because  they  respond  to  number  concentrations  in  the  whole  ion 

population,  and  can  resolve  changes  in  individual  classes  of small ions.  Depending 

on time resolution, changes in the spectrum can be related to ionic growth processes. 

Ionic radii and masses can be calculated directly from mobility, thus providing size-

resolved data with the additional benefit of electrical information. Mobility spectra of 

atmospheric  ions  can  also  be  thought  of  as  linking  the  electrical  parameters  of  the 

atmosphere  to  the  chemical  ones  (Nagato  and  Ogawa,  1998).  Ion  mobility  spectra, 

with  their  potentially  detailed  information  about  ion  evolution  (primarily  limited  in 

time  resolution),  can  complement  mass  spectra,  which require discrete sampling but 

are able to give more precise chemical details. Hƒ±rrak et al (1998b) believe a full air 

ion mobility spectrum gives a thorough description of the electrical state of air. This 

facilitates comprehension of the characteristics of both the global electrical circuit and 

electrically  charged  atmospheric  aerosol,  which  are  emerging  as  increasingly 

important in the climate system. 

 

In  the  Gerdien  condenser,  changing  the  magnitude  of  the  electrical  field  or  the 

dimensions of the capacitor varies the fraction of ions that can pass through the tube 

without  being  drawn  to  the  central  electrode  and  contributing  to  the current. This is 

described by Eq. 2.11. Varying the voltage across the tube, or the flow rate through it, 

therefore  provides  a  way  to  study  the  characteristics  of  ions  of  different  sizes.  If 

current  measurements  are  made  with  different  voltages  across  the  capacitor,  the  ion 

concentration n can be found if the conductivity and critical mobility are known.  

Chapter 2

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

2.6.1  Theory 
Gerdien  condensers  and  other  ion  spectrometers  provide  discrete  measurements  of 

number concentration in separate mobility categories. Ion spectra from such data can 

be calculated by a number of methods, discussed in this section.  

 

 

The  method  can  vary  depending  on  which  part  of  the  ion  spectrum  is  under 

consideration.  For example, Hƒ±rrak et al (1998b) have obtained spectra of the whole 

ion size range. For large ions, they calculate a least squares fit to a distribution similar 

to  the  log-normal  distribution  representing  the  broader  aerosol  spectrum.  Brownlee 

(1975a)  also  fitted  distributions  by  least  squares  regression  to  his  ion  spectrum 

measurements, choosing to use a log-normal distribution for the small ions and a delta 

function for the large ions. The difficulty with this method is that it assumes a form 

for the ion spectrum, which to some extent requires pre-solution of the problem before 

measurements  have  been  attempted. 

If  physical  processes  occur 

that  are 

incommensurate  with  the  previously  selected  model,  they  will  reduce  the (cid:147)goodness 
of fit(cid:148) to the model18. Consequently, events that might be worthwhile to study may be 

viewed as undesirable perturbations, or may not even be noticed if (cid:147)goodness of fit(cid:148) 

parameters are not quoted. In their comparison of spectral inversion methods, Hƒ±rrak 

et al (1998b) observe that the technique of calculating the spectrum from the aerosol 

charge  distribution  over-predicted  the  number  of  particles  of  radius  below  1.3 nm. 

They suggested that this was due to non-equilibrium charging because of the presence 

of  very  fresh  charged  particles,  i.e.  that  a  mechanism  was  occurring  which  had  not 

been accounted for in their presupposition of the aerosol distribution. This exemplifies 

the difficulties of assuming a model for the ion spectrum, but data inversion would be 

impossible without a predetermined model to fit to. 

 
Brownlee  (1975a)  also  discusses  a  more  analytical  approach,  deriving  the  (cid:147)inverse 

analytic  spectrometer  transform(cid:148)  for  measurements  made  with  a  Gerdien  condenser, 
where i is the current, ¬µ mobility, u flow rate, n the nth mobility category and f(¬µ)d¬µ

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

The spectrum can be calculated from a series of measurements of ion currents in for a 
range of mobilities ¬µn. Since the spectrum integral is only the number of ions in the 

range  between  each  pair  of  mobility  steps,  the  mobility  spectrum  obtained  is  in  the 

form  of  a  histogram  with  each  bar  width  equivalent  to  the  mobility  interval and the 

height the number of ions within that mobility step. This method sacrifices mobility 

resolution  but  does  not  require  prima  facie  assumptions  about  the  nature  of  the  ion 

spectrum  in  order  to  interpolate  between  ion  concentrations  obtained  at  discrete 

mobilities.  

 

 

 

2.6.2  Instrumentation   
There are two types of mobility spectrometer based on the Gerdien-like concept of a 

capacitor  collecting  an  ion  current.  The  drift  tube  is  not  ventilated,  whilst  the 

ventilated  spectrometer  is  known  as  an  aspiration  spectrometer.  The  drift  tube  is 

preferable when there is a limited volume of air to be sampled, a relatively high ion 

concentration and small (high mobility) ions only are to be measured (Matisen et al, 

1992).  The  aspiration  spectrometer  is  probably  more  suited  to  measurements  in 

atmospheric  air,  where  air  ions  exist  in  a  wide  mobility  range  and  varying 

concentrations. 

Measurements  of  air  ions  can  of  course  be  made  with  other  mobility  spectrometers. 

But  since  by  definition,  the  drift  tube  requires  a  particular  sample  of  air  to  be 

analysed,  they  are  poorly  suited  to  in  situ,  high  time  resolution  atmospheric 

applications. Drift tube spectrometers operate by measuring ion current as a function 

of  distance  away  from  the  source,  and  Nagato  and  Ogawa(cid:146)s  (1998)  instrument  is 

depicted  in  Figure  2.8.  Since  mobility  is  a  measure  of  ionic  velocity  in  an  electric 

field,  the  currents  at  a  certain  time  and  distance  from  the  source  allow  mobility 

selection. In this case the drift time td is given by Nagato and Ogawa (1998) as

Eq. 2.29 

where ¬µ is the mobility, L distance from the source and V voltage in the chamber. A 

further  disadvantage  of  this  spectrometer  for  air  ion  measurements,  is  that  artificial 

ionisation  with  a  radioactive  source  is  usually  necessary  to  provide  big  enough

currents from the small volume of air sampled. However, drift tube spectrometers can 

give high mobility resolution and estimates of the times of evolution of different ions. 

 

 

Air ion counters have been designed and made at the University of Tartu in Estonia 

for  fifty  years,  but  the  first  air  ion  spectrometer  was  made  in  1972  (Matisen  et  al, 

1992).  The  Estonian  small  ion  spectrometer  is  depicted  in  Figure  2.9.  It  is  a  multi-

electrode cylindrical capacitor, which measures currents from corona charging of the 

particles  with  MOSFET  electrometers  and  can  detect  intermediate  and  small  ions at 
concentrations down to 10 cm-3 (Matisen et al, 1992). In Figure 2.9, the high voltage 

supply is used to produce the corona, and the voltage supply is the bias voltage across 

the  electrodes.  Since  there  are  several  electrometers  measuring  currents  at  different 

points along the tube, each current measurement comes from ions in a mobility range 

defined  by  the  position  of  the  connection  to  the  electrometer.  The  instrument  is 

located  inside  a  building  with  ions  entering  through  a  2m  inlet  made  of  aluminium 

tube,  and  three  measuring  capacitors  of  the  same  design  are  used  to  detect  small, 

large 

intermediate  and 
total  of  20  different  mobility  categories 
simultaneously  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al  1998a).  The  mobility19  range  covered  is  0.00032-
3.2 cm2V-1s-1  ,  once  every  five  minutes.  The  results  are  corrected  for  losses  to  the 

in  a 

ions 

walls of the inlet pipe using a correction derived specifically for the instrument (see 

Section 2.4).  

Gerdien  condensers  have  been  used  to  measure  ionic  mobility  spectra  by  Brownlee 

(1973,  1975a,  1975b),  Misaki  (1964)  and  Dhanorkar  and  Kamra  (1993).  Brownlee 

had an aspirated Gerdien sectioned into insulated collecting rings of different lengths, 
which measured naturally occurring air ions in a mobility range 0.96-0.23 cm2V-1s-1. 

His  aim  was  to  develop  a  fast  response  instrument  but  it  was  limited  to  twenty 

minutes  per  spectrum  by  the  availability  of  only  one  electrometer,  which  had  to  be 

used  to  store  charge  from  each  of  the  rings  in  turn,  with  reed  relay  switching. 

Dhanorkar and Kamra (1993) made simultaneous measurements of the currents from 

three  Gerdiens  of  different  sizes  with  one  air  inlet.  Their  instrument  permitted 

variation of both the bias voltage and flow rate, but they chose to vary the flow rate to 
avoid transients. The mobility range covered was wide (3.37 (cid:150) 6.91 x 10-4  cm2V-1s-1), 

                                                           
19 Since 1 cm2V-1s-1 = 1 x 10-4 m2V-1s-1, it is more convenient to refer to mobilities in units of cm2V-1s-1, 
and this convention is adopted from here onwards. 

Chapter 2

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

but  it  took  four  hours  to  scan  through  the  whole  size  range.  Dhanorkar  and  Kamra 

(1993) calculated mobility spectra by a differencing method from measurements made 

at  different  flow  rates,  but  they  do  not  explain  their  procedure.  Calculating  the 

spectrum  every  four  hours  assumes  that  the  ionic  properties  of  the  air  remained 

constant  over  this  period.  This  is  questionable  since  synoptic-scale  meteorological 

phenomena can vary over a few hours, let alone the very rapid turbulent fluctuations 

of the air. Ion variations are not exclusively synoptic-scale features, but medium-scale 

variations  which  can  happen  in  a  few  hours,  like  a  change  of  air  mass  from  clean 

maritime to polluted continental, will modify the electrical characteristics of the air. If 

Dhanorkar  and  Kamra  (1993)  did  difference  over  a  four  hour  period,  then  the  local 

meteorological  conditions  will  definitely  have  changed  because  of  factors  like  the 

angle of the sun, and this alone is enough to cast doubt on their procedure.

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

2.6.3  Air ion mobility spectra 
Ion mobility spectra have often been measured in laboratories with the ions produced 

artificially.  Whilst  this  is  a  valuable  tool  for  analysing  ions  under  controlled 

conditions,  the  behaviour  of  ions  in  the  atmosphere  is  very  different,  since  the 

atmospheric  aerosol  continually  interacts  with  the  ion  population.  As  natural  ion 

concentrations are lower than artificially produced populations, recombination is often 

exaggerated in ionisation chambers. Since this Thesis describes the development of an 

instrument  to  measure  natural  atmospheric  ions,  only  measurements  of  ions  in 

atmospheric  air  are  considered  here.  Brownlee  (1975a,b)  ultimately  only  partitioned 

his own ion measurements into two mobility categories; therefore his results are not 

discussed here as mobility spectra. 

 

 

Misaki  (1964)  obtained  several  hundred  large  ion  spectra  in  the  New  Mexico 

semidesert  from  a  Gerdien  condenser  with  varying  bias  voltage  and  two  central 

electrodes of different lengths. This arrangement enabled a wide mobility range to be 

studied, covering ions in the size range 7-44 nm. He also compared the measurements 

on  one  day  to  conductivity,  space  charge  and  residual  current,  and found an inverse 

relationship  between  large  ions  and  electrical  conductivity.  This  is  because  (cid:147)large 

ions(cid:148) are charged aerosol particles, so oppositely charged ions are even more likely to 

attach  to  them  than  neutral  aerosol  particles,  enhancing  the  inverse  relationship 

described in Section 2.2. The mobility spectra were rather smooth, with a tendency to 

shift  to  lower  mobilities  throughout  the  day.  On  several  days  peaks  in  the  spectrum 
appeared mid-morning which shifted to very low mobilities (10-4 cm2V-1s-1) over the 

next  few  hours.  Misaki  (1964)  thought  this  was  due  to  a  coagulation  process,  and 

suggested  that  future  studies  of  ion  growth  measure  neutral  particles  as  well. 

However, Misaki (1964) did not make measurements of smaller ions, without which it 

is difficult to postulate a growth mechanism for large ions. 

Dhanorkar and Kamra (1993) measured ion mobility spectra at Pune in India on two 

fair weather days at four-hour intervals. Interestingly, their data showed that there was 

an inexplicable excess of negative ions and space charge at 0400 and 0900, which is 

opposite to what is expected, given the electrode effect (MR, 1998). On both days the 

mobility  spectra  showed  a  slight  shift  towards  lower  mobilities  throughout  the  day, 

coinciding  with  an  increase  in  the  population  of  the  smallest  ions  in  the  afternoon.

Photochemical  activity  was  suggested  as  an  explanation  for  the  new  particle 

production  later  in  the  day.  Natural  radioactivity  trapped  in  the  nocturnal  inversion 

produced  high  concentrations  of  new  ions  in  the  early  mornings,  but  there  was  no 

associated peak of slower ions. This evidence suggests that the ionic growth processes 

observed are not associated with higher concentrations of radioactive gases, although 

the idea about photochemical activity was not investigated further by Dhanorkar and 

Kamra (1993). 

 

Air  ions  have  been  measured  at  Tahkuse  Laboratory,  a  rural  site  in  Estonia,  since 

1988  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al,  2000).  This  has  permitted  long-term  average  spectra  to  be 

produced,  and  other  detailed  analyses  of  air  ion  characteristics.  Figure  2.10  is  a 

summary of the measurements made at Tahkuse Observatory, which have been used 

to  characterise  and  classify  air  ions  in  detail.  Small  ions  are  defined  as  having 
mobilities  above  0.5 cm2V-1s-1,  after  which  there  is  a  depletion  of  ions  down  to 
mobilities of about 0.05 cm2V-1s-1. Figure 2.11 shows the average small ion spectrum, 

which is the longest average ion mobility spectrum available. In the air ion literature 

the  average  mobility  is  defined  as  the  most  frequently  occurring  mobility  (Mohnen, 

1974) and in Hƒ±rrak et al (2000) the average mobilities are both in the range 1.3-1.6 
cm2V-1s-1,  implying  that  the  ion  asymmetry  ratio  is  almost  1.  This  is  ascribed  to  an 

absence  of  the  electrode  effect  because  of  the  height  of  the  inlet:  about  2 m.

characteristics  of  the  large  ion  spectrum  concur  with  theoretical  calculations  for

The standard deviation in the intermediate ion range is quite large, owing to regular 

(cid:147)bursts(cid:148)  of  enhanced  intermediate  ion  production.    Typical  concentrations  are  about 
50 cm-3, but during the bursts, the concentration can increase to 900 cm-3 over the day. 

Hƒ±rrak  et  al  (1998a),  describe  slow  increases  in  the  fraction  of  ions  in  the 

intermediate  size  range,  peaking  at  about  10 nm,  occurring  over  a  period  of  about 

eight  hours  during  daylight.  This  is  indicative  of  an  ionic  growth  process,  and  has 

occurred  consistently  in  measurements  made  from  1988-1994.  The  events  occur  in 

fair weather periods, typically associated with anticyclonic, clean air masses from the 

Baltic Sea (Hƒ±rrak et al, 2000). This behaviour is very similar to the observations by 

Misaki  (1964)  and  Dhanorkar  and  Kamra  (1993).  Hƒ±rrak  et  al  (1998a)  also  suggest 

that  these  intermediate  ions  continue  growing  into  large  ions  due  to  a  high  time-

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

lagged  correlation  between  intermediate  and  large  ions.  Two  mechanisms  were 

suggested, firstly that new particles were formed by homogeneous nucleation and then 

charged by small ion attachment. The second idea was that the particles were growing 

by an ion-induced nucleation process, following sudden bursts of some precursor gas, 

which was not nitrogen dioxide or water vapour, but was otherwise unknown.  

There exist relatively few measurements of ion mobility spectra, and the only set of 

long-term averages are from the clean air measurements at Tahkuse Observatory. In a 

classic  paper,  Mohnen (1974) pictured the atmospheric ion spectrum as shifting and 

elusive,  from  which  only  instantaneous  snapshots  can  be  captured.  With  increasing 

observations  of  ion  growth  processes,  there  is  even  greater  contemporary  need  to 

develop  instrumentation  which  can  focus  on  the  areas  clearly  demanding  further 

study. 

2.7  Nucleation 

A further motivation is the possibility that ions could be involved in the production of 

particles  acting  as  condensation  nucleii  (CN)  in  the  atmosphere,  which  is  currently 

attracting increased attention. C.T.R. Wilson (1897, 1899) reported that new particles 

were  made  in  the  presence  of  ultraviolet  radiation  and  radioactive  sources.  He  was 

certainly the first person to suggest that ions might be involved in particle formation, 

and  also  to  realise  the  importance  this  would  have  for  climate.  Apart  from  some 

sporadic  studies,  (Verzar  and  Evans,  1953;  Bricard  et  al,  1968)  it  is  only  in 

approximately  the  last  ten  years  that  the  importance  of  new  particles  in  the 

atmosphere,  and  the  potential  r(cid:244)le  of  ions  in  their  formation,  has  begun  to  be 

recognised  widely.  Harrison  (2000)  has  even  suggested  a  modification  to  the  ion 
balance  equation  (Eq.  2.19)  to  include  a  coefficient  for  ion-induced  nucleation,  Œ≥, 

where  Œ≥  is  proportional  to  the  ion  concentration  raised  to  some  power  p  where  p  is 

between 0 and 1, depending on the nucleation mechanism. If Œ≥ does exist, then the ion 

balance equation can be rewritten as

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

The  recent  surge  of  interest  in  this  subject  could  have  been  provoked  by  several 

factors,  for  example  unexplained  observations  of  bursts  of  new  particles  in  the 

atmosphere  (O(cid:146)Dowd  et  al,  1996,  M(cid:228)kel(cid:228)  et  al,  1997).  Theories  of  binary 

homogenous  nucleation,  which  is  the  classically  assumed  aerosol  formation 

mechanism (O(cid:146)Dowd et al, 1996), also predict rates that are too slow to account for 

observed  aerosol  concentrations  (Yu  and  Turco,  2000;  Kulmala  et  al,  2000).  A 

number  of  laboratory  studies  have  shown  that  particles  can  be  produced  in  the 

presence  of  ionising  radiation,  although  the  findings  are  not  concordant,  and  the 

experiments often involved so much radiation that their results cannot be extrapolated 

to atmospheric conditions. Climate models need to include aerosol particle source and 

loss terms accurately to parameterise the radiative effects of the atmospheric aerosol 

burden. Finally, the controversial theory relating the solar cycle to global cloud cover 

suggests  that  ionisation  contributes  to  particle  formation  without  postulating  a 

microphysical  mechanism  (e.g.  Svensmark  and  Friis-Christensen,  1997).  Although 

this  has  attracted  considerable  attention  to  the  topic,  in  particular  to  rebutting  their 

theory, (a particularly recent example is Jorgensen and Hansen (2000)) little effort has 

been made to prove or refute the microphysical aspects. 

2.7.1  Nucleation onto ions 
Heterogeneous  nucleation  is  the  term  used  to  describe  the  condensation  of  some 

vapour onto a particle of a different composition to the vapour. When the particle is 

an  ion,  the  physics  is  quantified  by  the  Thomson  equation,  which  describes  the 

variation in the Gibbs free energy of molecules clustering around a nucleus. When the 
Gibbs  free  energy  ‚àÜG  is  at  a  saddle  point,  particle  growth  becomes  energetically 

feasible.  If  r  is  particle  radius,  œÅ  the  fluid  density,  S  is  supersaturation  ratio,  M  the 
mass  of  the  molecule  (in  SI  units),  q  particle  charge,  Œ≥T  the  surface  tension,  kB 

Boltzmann(cid:146)s  constant,  T  temperature,  Œµr  the  relative  permittivity  and  ro  the  initial 

particle radius, the equilibrium condition for this situation can be written as:

occur  in  the  atmosphere.  However,  comparison  with  the  greater  supersaturations 

needed for homogenous nucleation illustrates the way in which electrical charge can 

stabilise cluster growth.

when  it  has  a  critical  radius  of  about  5 nm  and  a  charge  exceeding  about  ten 

elementary  charges.  This  suggests  that  ions  can  act  as  nucleation  sites  for  water 

droplet growth, but since few particles in the atmosphere hold the necessary charge, 

there is a low probability of this occurring. Ion-assisted nucleation of sulphuric acid is 

possibly more likely because of its lower vapour pressure, and Figure 2.12 shows that

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

for  greater  than  one  elementary  charge,  sulphuric  acid  can  be  nucleated  at  lower 

supersaturations  than  water.  Typically,  sulphuric  acid  exists  in  the  atmosphere  at 
300K with a partial pressure of 10-4 mbar (Warneck, 1987) and in concentrations of 

order 0.04 pptv (Kirkby et al, 2000). The saturation vapour pressure of sulphuric acid 

at  300K  is  around  400 mbar,  so  any  supersaturation  in  these  conditions  is  highly 

unlikely.  

2.7.2  Laboratory observations of nucleation 
Bricard  et  al  (1968)  measured  the  number  of  new  particles  formed  in  clean  air  in  a 

chamber  under  the  influence  of  ionising  radiation,  different  trace  gases  and 

illumination. They found the CN concentration could be made to cycle up and down 
when  regularly  adding  a  short-lived  source  of  Œ±-particles  (0.5 Bqm-3)20  on  a  five-

minute  timescale,  when  the  concentration  of  new  aerosol  varied  by  approximately  a 

factor of two (Figure 2.13). The radii of the new particles were estimated to be 2 nm 

in the presence of the radiation, and 12 nm out of it. The smaller particles correspond 

to  the  size  of  atmospheric  small  ions,  which  are  produced  in  abundance  by  the 

radioactive  source.  However,  further  measurements  showed  that  only  about  10%  of 

the  total  particle  number  was  charged,  indicating  that  in  the  presence  of  ionising 

radiation  an  excess  of  neutral  particles  were  produced.  This  suggests  an  ion-ion 

recombination mechanism; but Bricard et al (1968) hypothesised that the coagulation 

rate  depended  on  the  sulphur  dioxide  concentration,  in  the  presence  of  some  other 

gaseous impurity. 

 

Bricard et al (1968) also measured ion mobility spectra during the nucleation process, 

finding  a  number  of  well-defined  ion  mobilities,  which  they  matched  to  certain 

species. Addition of SO2 caused the mean mobility to decrease, and the characteristics 

of  the  mobility  spectrum  changed  to  a  continuous  shape,  indicating  ionic  growth 

processes.  Application  of  Thomson(cid:146)s  theory  for  heterogeneous  nucleation  gave  a 

critical radius, (the minimum radius of stable particles) of 0.7 nm if the mobility was 
1 cm2V-1s-1  (corresponding  to  a  typical  atmospheric  small  ion  of  radius  0.5 nm 

(Tammet, 1995)). It was suggested that the presence of sulphuric acid in the vicinity 

of  the  droplets  promoted  nucleation  by  increasing  the  supersaturation.  The

hypothesised physical growth mechanism (Bricard et al, 1968) was that the particles 

grew because neutral nucleii of below the critical radius captured a charged particle to 

stabilise  and  then  grow.  However,  this  does  not  explain  Bricard  et  al‚Äôs  observations 

(1968) of production of neutral particles in a radioactive environment.

In the 1980s there was a resurgence of interest in the formation of aerosol particles in 

the  atmosphere.  Increasing  concentrations  of  the  radioactive  gas  Krypton-85  from 

nuclear  fuel  reprocessing  generally  encouraged  research  into  the  atmospheric effects

the  depletion  of  forests  near  to  nuclear  installations,  motivated  studies  of  whether 

radioactivity  could  be  implicated  in  the  production  of  sulphuric  acid  aerosol  in 

polluted (particularly SO2 laden) environments (Raes et al, 1985). 

Consequently  there  were  several  laboratory  studies  attempting  to  simulate  aerosol 

production  from  ionising  radiation,  usually  in  air  containing  SO2,  and  a  radioactive 

source. Raes et al (1985) carried out experiments in synthetic air containing typically 
0.015 ppm  NO2  and  0.5  ppm  SO2,  with  cobalt-60  (a  Œ≥-source)  and  ultra-violet 
irradiation.  They  found  that  at  the  higher  dose  rates,  Œ≥-radiation  could  produce  an 
extra  105  particles  cm-3,  but  at  low  dose  rates,  ultra-violet  radiation  was  needed  in 

addition to the ionising radiation to produce any new aerosol particles. The threshold 
activity  was  found  to  be  10-2 ¬µGys-1  22,  which  is  about  three  orders  of  magnitude 

higher than natural background activity. This study is unrealistic for the atmosphere, 
since  Œ≥-radiation  is  poor  at  ionising  air  and  only  contributes  slightly  to  atmospheric 

ionisation, and Raes et al (1986) conceded that their results were not applicable to the 

atmosphere. 

More  recent  work  (Emi  et  al,  1998)  contradicts  both  Bricard  et  al  (1968)  and 

Diamond  et  al  (1985)  who  reported  that  only  neutral  particles  were  produced  from 

ions. Emi et al (1998) describe results obtained with an ion mobility analyser, with an 

americium-241  source  in  air  containing  5 ppm  SO2  and  3500 ppm  water.  They 
observed  a  mobility  peak  at  0.1 cm-2V-1s-1,  which  clearly  shows  the  presence  of 

charged particles of 1 nm radius (Tammet, 1995). This is suggestive of an ion growth 

process,  but  since  the  particles  formed  are  only  intermediate  ions  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al, 

1998a) this provides no evidence of nucleation to larger aerosol particles. Adachi et al 

(1998)  measured  the  charged  fraction  in  a  mixture  of  NO2,  ammonia  (0.68 ppm), 

water (3000 ppm) and air, in the presence of two 3.03 MBq americium-241 sources. 
About  103  cm-3 new  particles  were  produced  after  three  minutes  in  the  presence  of 

small  concentrations  of  NO2,  80%  of  which  were  charged.  This  again  suggests  ion 

growth  is  occurring,  but  no  information  regarding  the  size  of  the  particles  produced 

 

 

 

was available.

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

Diamond et al (1985) suggest a mechanism whereby ions are not directly involved in 

a chemical reaction to make sulphuric acid. Their mechanism involves an excited ion 

transferring  its  energy  to  assist  in  SO2  oxidation,  which  then  leads  to  nucleation. 

Although  they  argue  relatively  convincingly  for  this  mechanism  given  their 

observations of the chemistry of different energy ions from different sources, they do 

not address the fundamental question of whether the precursor ions are likely to meet 

the  energetic  requirements  for  the  reaction.  Further  research  into  the  basic  chemical 

properties of air ions is clearly required for this line of enquiry to progress further. 

The  experiments  of  Vohra  et  al  (1984)  appear  to  be  the  only  laboratory  studies  of 

particle  formation  with  levels  of radioactivity naturally occurring in the atmosphere. 
They  used  a  radon  source  of  100-500 pCi m-3  (atmospheric  concentrations  are  cited 
by Vohra et al (1984) as 90-400 pCi m-3)23, and found that 7 x 104 m-3 particles were 

formed  in  their  4:1  nitrogen-oxygen  mixture  in  the  presence  of  SO2,  ozone  and 

ethene, with radon present at the lowest atmospheric concentrations. Since Vohra et al 

(1984)  did  not  even  mention  ions  in  their  discussions,  it  would  be  helpful  for  these 

experiments to be repeated in conjunction with detailed ion measurements. A similar 

experiment  has  been  proposed  at  CERN  to  simulate  atmospheric  ionisation  in  a 

controlled environment (Kirkby et al, 2000). This will be the first of its kind, since the 

ionisation will be similar to that caused by cosmic rays, and may help to explain the 

observations of Vohra et al (1984).  

 

 

It would be useful to have an empirical expression for ion (or particle) production as a 

function  of  radiation based on all these experiments. This is difficult because of the 

different  radioactive  sources  and  units  used.  In  terms  of  ionisation,  the  units  of 

Roentgen and Becquerel appear favourable to describe radiation, since Roentgens are 
defined  explicitly  in  terms  of  ionisation  in  air:  1  Roentgen  is  the  dose  of  X  or  Œ≥-

radiation  such  that  the  emission  per  0.001293g  of  air  produces  1 e.s.u.  of  electric 

charge (Handloser, 1959). In modern units, 1 Roentgen is equivalent to 208230 ions 
m-3, or 8.7 mGy in air. The Roentgen is rarely used now because of its irrelevance to 
health physics, and the ionisation in air is only defined in terms of X and Œ≥-radiation, 

which are not the major sources of air ions. The Becquerel is defined as one decay per

second; a single radioactive source has a total activity, often defined in Bq, whereas 

for a fluid a volume must also be quoted. The experiments described above use a wide 

variety of sources, units and chamber volumes, not all of which are quoted to facilitate 

the calculations necessary for comparisons.  

 
The  majority  of  ionisation  at  ground  level  is  from  Œ±-radiation,  which  is  effective  at 

ionisation  in  air  (hence  its  short  range),  so  all  Œ±-decays  can  be  assumed  to  produce 

ions.  As  the  energy  required  to  make  an  air  ion  pair  is  constant,  the  ion  production 

rate q should be directly proportional to the activity expressed in Becquerels at ground 
level, because of the dominance by Œ±-radiation. However, the relationship is likely to 

vary  with  the  type  of  ionising  radiation,  since  the  amount  of  energy  given  up  by 

different radioactive particles to ionisation varies greatly. M(cid:228)kel(cid:228) (1992) discusses a 

more generally applicable measure of ionisation, the G-value, which is the number of 

ion  pairs  produced  per  100eV  of  absorbed  energy.  This  varies  depending  on  the 

species ionised, because of their varying ionisation energy.

A plot of the dose in Grays against q should also be linear, independent of the source, 

since  it  is  related  the  energy  used  in  ionisation.  The  effectiveness  (or  not)  of  the 

radioactive  species  in  ionisation  is  accounted  for,  because  by  measuring  absorbed 

energy in a Geiger tube, this energy must have also been used in ionisation. As about 

35.6 eV is required to ionise one molecule of air, an average value of G in air is 2.81 

ions/100 eV. 

2.7.3  Observations of nucleation in the atmosphere 
Observations of new particle production in clean air, or air otherwise depleted of CN, 

for  example  in  the  marine  boundary  layer,  have  recently  become  available.  These 

typically show bursts of particles in the nanometre size range, which are first observed 

in  the  morning  and  grow  throughout  the  day.  O(cid:146)Dowd  et  al  (1996)  have  observed

sudden increases in the CN concentration, in marine environments in Antarctica and 

in  the  Outer  Hebrides.  During  a  particularly  sudden  nucleation burst in the Weddell 
Sea,  the  CN  concentration  increased  from  550  to  3500 cm-3  in  15  minutes, 
corresponding  to  a  nucleation  rate  of  about  3  particles  cm-3s-1  (though  Antarctic 

conditions  are  fairly  unique  in  meteorological  and  biological  terms).  The  CN 

concentration  was  reported  to  decay  in  3-4  hours  after  the  bursts  due  to  rapid  loss 

from mixing, advection and coagulation. This time scale is less than the time scale of 
CN  growing  to  CCN  (‚âà 50 nm).  There  were  also  regular  observations  of  nucleation 

bursts  in  the  Outer  Hebrides,  where  CN  grew  from  < 8 nm  to  about  40 nm  in 

approximately  an  hour,  then decayed rapidly in half that time. O(cid:146)Dowd et al (1996) 

were  unable  to  suggest  a  mechanism  for  these  events,  but  noted  that  at  the  Scottish 

site, there were large kelp beds near the coast leading to enhanced levels of dimethyl 

sulphide (DMS), a compound known to be significant in aerosol formation. 

M(cid:228)kel(cid:228)  et  al  (1997)  measured particles with radii from 1.5-250 nm with differential 

mobility  particle  sizers  at  Hyyti(cid:228)l(cid:228),  in  Finnish  pine  forest.  Unlike  O(cid:146)Dowd  et  al 

(1996),  particles  were  observed  growing  from  5-6 nm  at  a  few  nanometres  per  hour 

continuously until the evening, when they were big enough to be subsumed into the 

background aerosol. These events occurred during sunny days in spring and summer 

when  there  was  a  large  temperature  difference  between  the  morning  and  early 

afternoon,  and  the  relative  humidity  decreased  consistently.  On  the  days  when  

nucleation  was  observed,  there  was  often  a  reversal  of  the  vertical  temperature 

gradient  when  the  stable  nocturnal  boundary  layer  broke  down  at  0800-0900.  This 

suggested that the particle formation events were associated with vertical mixing and 

could have been produced at a different height to the measurements, although M(cid:228)kel(cid:228) 

et al (1997) were confident that the smallest particles were produced in situ, probably 

because of their short lifetime. The origin of the particles could not be ascertained and 

was  not  directly  related  to  any  measured  soil  conditions.  Photochemical  or  biogenic 

activity  producing  trace  species  was  a  possible  cause,  but  photosynthesis  was 

discounted since it does not occur in Finland in early spring.

M(cid:228)kel(cid:228)  (1992)  modelled  the  production  of  sulphuric  acid  aerosol  in  an  irradiated 

environment.  His  first  step  was  to  model  the  formation  of  ions  from  radioactivity 

(assuming  an  aerosol-free  environment,  and  that  the  dose  rate  distribution  is 

Gaussian). He expressed the change of ion concentration dn/dt in unit volume as

Figure  2.14  shows  the  relationship  between  dose  rate  and  ion  concentration  and

(1992),  which  they  calculated  assuming  the  recombination  limit  (Eq.  2.20).  The  ion 

production rate q, also calculated assuming the recombination limit (Eq. 2.20), shows 
a good (R2 = 0.998) linear relationship with radioactive dose D. In the recombination 
limit, D should be proportional to n2. The best power law fit between D and n gives 
D ‚àù n0.64,  which  shows  that  the  recombination  limit  is  a  good  approximation.  The 

Chapter 2

The significance of atmospheric ion measurements 

recombination  limit  is  not  a  perfect  fit  to  the  data,  because  Raes  et  al  (1985,  1986) 

reported aerosol production in their experiments (described in Section 2.7.2) so there 

would  have  been  attachment  effects.  This  plot  is  not  applicable  to  atmospheric  air, 

since  the  dose  and  ionisation  rates  are  much  higher  than  typical  atmospheric 
ionisation rates (2-10 ion pairs cm-3s-1). 

 

M(cid:228)kel(cid:228) (1992), empirically estimated sulphuric acid aerosol production as a function 

of irradiation. From two sets of existing measurements, he was able to state that for a 
total dose of 1mGy, if one ion is produced per 100eV this gives 8 x 1013 particles m-3. 

He  then  measured  the  production  of  ultra-fine  aerosol  particles  in  a  water-sulphuric 
acid system in a chamber irradiated with 241Am. His results are shown in Figure 2.15. 

Above a dose of about 0.4 mGy, the number of particles formed varied linearly with 

respect  to  dose  rate,  with  a  gradient  equivalent  to  the  square  root  of  the  dose.  This 

implies  that  the  particles  are  behaving  as  ions  under  the  recombination  limit,  which 

M(cid:228)kel(cid:228) (1992) interprets as ion-induced nucleation of particles provoked by the very 

high  ion  concentration.  This  hypothesis  is  supported  by his observations of shifts in 

the ion mobility spectrum towards larger sizes. The (cid:147)critical dose rate(cid:148) above which 

the experimental results become linear is probably when there are enough ions present 

for them to condense onto every sulphuric acid particle. M(cid:228)kel(cid:228) (1992) also explains 

that  at  high  dose  rates,  the  particle  concentration  becomes  steady  because  of 

attachment.  These  results  are  clearly  inapplicable  to  the  atmosphere,  since  the 

chamber  is  so  highly  ionised  that  the  recombination  limit  affects  even  the  new 

particles  that  are  produced,  and  in  the  atmosphere  the  background  aerosol  would 

modulate the ion production rate, probably to the extent that it never gets high enough 

for ion-induced nucleation.

A microphysical model of ions and aerosol including detailed electrostatic effects has 

been  used  by  Turco  et  al  (1998)  and  Yu  and  Turco  (2000)  to  show  that  ions  in 

atmospheric  concentrations  can  facilitate  production  of  sulphate  aerosol  by 

nucleation. Sulphate was chosen for use in the model because from observations, it is 

the most likely nucleating agent, and its thermodynamics is better characterised than 

other potential nucleating agents such as organic compounds (Turco et al, 1998). The 

microphysical  model  had  previously  been  used  to  accurately  predict  particle 

formation  from  ions  in  aircraft  plumes  (Yu  and  Turco,  1997).  Though  under  these 

conditions  ion  and  sulphate  concentrations  are  much  higher  than  in  the  atmosphere, 

these results indicate that the microphysics of ion-mediated nucleation is an existing 

effect, which has been accurately parameterised in the aerosol model. The mechanism 

suggested by Yu and Turco (2000) is one whereby the recombination of a hydronium 

positive ion and a sulphate negative ion can produce a cluster that is larger than the

critical  size  for  nucleation.  This  effect  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  sulphuric  acid 

concentration,  with  the  degree  of  dependency  varying  non-linearly  with  the  various 

feedback  mechanisms.  Turco  et  al  (1998)  calculate  that  the  nucleation  rate  Jnuc 

depends on the sulphuric acid concentration [H2SO4] raised to some power n, where 

the constant of proportionality accounts for the ionisation rate

Eq. 2.33. 

The magnitude of n is related to the number of ligands that are required to stabilise a 

neutral recombination product, and will vary according to the temperature and relative 

humidity. A secondary mechanism is that the electrical charge held by an ion cluster 

can also enhance the probability of a collision with a molecule of sulphuric acid by an 

order of magnitude (Yu and Turco, 2000). 

In  Yu  and  Turco  (2000)  the  model  is  tested  by  applying  similar  code  to  the  initial 

conditions  for  observations  of  particle  formation  from  air  ion  mobility  spectra  at 

Tahkuse  Observatory  (discussed  above),  and  also  measurements  of  ultrafine  aerosol 

and  sulphuric  acid  made  in  Colorado.  In  both  cases  the  model  accurately  predicts 

similar  results  to  the  experiments.  However,  the  effects  of  background  aerosol  are 

ignored which meant that to get ion concentrations comparable with those measured 

at Tahkuse, the surface ionisation rate had to be set at a value which is comparable to 
the  cosmic  ray  contribution  only.  Rather  than  scaling  q  to  2 cm-3s-1  to  arrive  at 
n = 1000cm-3,  it  might  be  better  to  retain  a  more  typical  atmospheric  value  of  q  = 
10cm-3 s-1 (Chalmers, 1967).  In this case, assuming a steady-state variation and using

(Clement  and  Harrison,  1992)  there  should  actually  be  an  associated  pre-existing 
monodisperse aerosol concentration of Z ‚âà 1000cm-3, using an ion-aerosol attachment 

coefficient  Œ≤  typical  of  a  0.2 (cid:181)m  radius  aerosol.  This  presence  of  the  background 

aerosol particles is particularly important because they can also remove the necessary 

condensable vapour, cutting off the nucleation (Harrison and Aplin, 2000b).  

 
It is interesting that Yu and Turco(cid:146)s (2000) model should match the Estonian results 

so  well,  since  their  ion-ion  recombination  mechanism  suggests  that  neutral  particles 

should  be  produced,  and  in  this  case  there  would  be  no  progressive  shift  in  the 

Chapter 2

mobility  spectrum.  This  implies  one  of  two  things;  either  that  the  enhanced 

coagulation  onto  charged  particles  is  actually  more  significant  than  their  model 

suggests, or secondly that the sulphuric acid concentrations (which were not measured 

at Tahkuse) were selected so as to give results which fitted the observations best. The 

second  set  of  results  the  model  was  compared  are  more  appropriate  since  neutral 

particles were measured as well as sulphuric acid.  

 

Kulmala  et  al  (2000)  propose  a  different  mechanism,  which  has  also  had  some 

success  in  explaining  experimental  observations.  They  have  modelled  a  ternary 

nucleation  system,  of  sulphuric  acid,  ammonia  and  water,  which  predicts  nucleation 

under 

typical 

tropospheric  sulphuric  acid  concentrations.  Other  suggested 

mechanisms  tend  to  rely  on  transiently  high  supersaturations  of  sulphuric  acid  for 

nucleation, which are both unproven and difficult to measure.  They suggest a model 

where there are reservoirs of thermodynamically stable clusters (TSCs) which are too 

small to detect (< 1nm), and certain conditions will trigger their growth to resolvable 

sizes, which is when a (cid:147)nucleation burst(cid:148) occurs. The detectable TSC concentration is 

dependent on the existing aerosol concentration; when this is high the TSCs are lost 

by  coagulation  to  larger  aerosol  particles.  The  sulphuric  acid  concentration  is  also 

important  and  nucleation  rates  are  about  a  thousand  times  slower  than  in  binary 

nucleation  because  of  the  lower  concentrations  required.  If,  however,  air  containing 

TSCs  is  advected  over  a  mass  of  a  source  of  condensable  species  (for  example, 

photochemically produced organics) this can produce a burst of larger particles which 

can continue to grow to the sizes detected by M(cid:228)kel(cid:228) et al (1997). In Kulmala et al 

(2000),  their  ternary  nucleation  model  is  applied  to  the  preliminary  conditions  for 

nucleation  at  Hyyti(cid:228)l(cid:228)  in  Finland  and  matches  the  observations  well.  It  does  not 

appear to be possible to test this model properly until aerosol instrumentation that can 

measure  particles  in  the  1-3 nm  size  range  is  available.  This  nucleation  mechanism, 

however, does not invoke ions, unlike Yu and Turco (2000) and Hƒ±rrak et al (1998a, 

2000), since the TSCs are neutral particles and for there to be charge equilibrium with 

the  background  small  ion  concentration,  only  a  tiny  fraction  could  be  charged. 

Kulmala  et  al  (2000)  firmly  rule  out  ion-induced  nucleation  because  their  ternary 

nucleation mechanism (in conjunction with advection of condensable vapour) occurs 
at rates of 50-100 cm-3s-1, which considerably exceeds average atmospheric ionisation 

Chapter 2

rates.  However,  the  ionisation  rate  can  vary  considerably  (Harrison,  2000)  and  it  is 

possible  that  short-lived  transients  caused  by  highly  energetic  particles  could  cause 

the ionisation rate to peak for long enough to push the TSCs into the detectable size 

range. 

There is a well-established body of evidence that ionising radiation can result in the 

production of fine particles. Additionally, it seems probable that ions are implicated in 

this process. However, the paucity of experimental atmospheric observations of ions 

and  particle  formation,  and  lack  of  a  plausible  theoretical  basis  has  meant  that 

experimentation  has  not  been  directed  towards  investigating  ions  and  atmospheric 

nucleation.  Only  very  recently  have  microphysical  simulations  suggested  nucleation 

mechanisms feasible in atmospheric conditions.   

2.8  Conclusions 

The  two  differing  theories  of  atmospheric  aerosol  formation,  both  of  which  have 

successfully  explained  aspects  of  existing  experimental  data,  now  provide  a  very 

strong  motivation  to  measure  air  ion  mobility  spectra.  In  one  of  these  theories,  ions 

are  crucial,  and  accurate  measurements  of  the  atmospheric  ion  spectrum  are  clearly 

required  to  corroborate  or  refute.  There  is  no  reason  why  both  the  mechanisms 

proposed  by  Kulmala  et  al  (2000)  and  Yu  and  Turco  (2000)  cannot  apply  under 

different  conditions,  but  further  investigations  of  ultrafine  aerosol  particles,  in 

conjunction  with  meteorological,  electrical  and  chemical  measurements  will  be 

required to differentiate between them. 

At  the  moment,  the  instrumentation  required  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  ions  are 

involved (by whatever mechanism) in CN production is not available. Instruments to 

measure ion mobility spectra have been developed and deployed, but there are often 

play-offs  between  mobility  and  time  resolution,  and  fundamental  assumptions  about 

the nature of the ion spectrum. Instrumentation developed to date has usually had its 

time and mobility resolution rigidly fixed at the outset as a consequence of its design, 

although  suitable  operating  conditions  may  only  be  known  after  observations  have 

been  made.  The  classical  Gerdien  instrumentation  also  fundamentally  lacks  a  viable 

calibration  technique,  despite  the  availability  of  an  alternative  mode  to  check  self-

consistency. There is a pressing need for a flexible and portable instrument that can be 

utilised for a variety of purposes.

3  A miniaturised Gerdien device 

 
 
In this chapter, an ion counter based on the classical cylindrical capacitor designed by 

Gerdien  (1905)  is  analysed  in  terms  of  its  separate  components.  Firstly,  some 

semantics  are  required  to  differentiate  the  components  of  the  ion  counter.  The  term 

(cid:147)Gerdien  tube(cid:148)  eponymously  refers  to  the  part  of  the  instrument  which  replicates 

Gerdien(cid:146)s,  i.e.  the  central  and  outer  cylindrical  electrodes.  (cid:147)Gerdien  condenser(cid:148)  is 

used  to  describe  the  capacitative  properties  of  the  Gerdien  tube.  The  instrument 

described  here  differs  from  the  classical  Gerdien  device  in  that  it  includes  a  third, 

screening  electrode,  and  here  this  configuration  is  simply  called  a  (cid:147)Gerdien(cid:148). 

(cid:147)Gerdien  system(cid:148)  refers  to  the  complete  instrumentation  necessary  to  measure  ions, 

which consists of the Gerdien, associated electrometer and bias voltage supply. 

The objectives of the chapter are to attain a detailed knowledge of the Gerdien system 

components, and to test the instrument in atmospheric air. The physical properties of 

the  tube  and  the  flow  through  it,  and  the  measurement  systems  are  all  examined  in 

terms  of  setting  design  criteria  (Section  3.1),  and  their  direct  application  to  making 

measurements  in  the  atmosphere  (Section  3.2).  Some  measurements  are  made  with 

the  Gerdien  system  in  air  in  Section  3.3.  They  are  tested  against  theoretical 

 

 

predictions, and for self-consistency. 

3.1  Design criteria 

3.1.1  Tube material and dimensions 
The  critical  mobility  defines  the  minimum  mobility  of  ion  which  contributes  to  the 

measurement  (see  Eq.  2.11)  and  is  the  single  most  important  Gerdien  design 

specification.  The  instrument  dimensions  need  to  be  chosen  so  that  the  critical 

mobility,  given  the  tube  voltage  and  airflow  rate,  is  an  appropriate  value  for 
measuring  atmospheric  ions.  Since  typical  ion  mobilities  ‚âà 10-4 m2V-1s-1,  the  critical 

mobility  needs  to  be  of  this  order  of  magnitude  for  conductivity  measurement  (see

Section 2.2.2). If the Gerdien is to be used as an ion mobility spectrometer, the tube 

dimensions  need  to  be  chosen  so  that  a  realistic  voltage  range  will  investigate  the 

desired  part  of  the  mobility  spectrum.  Exact  details  will  depend  on  the  context,  for 

example the ion size range to be investigated. Limitations to the bias voltage supply 

are also significant: large voltages are difficult to switch and control accurately, being 

prone to ripple (Harrison, 1997b). 

 

If  the  critical  mobility  is  low  enough  so  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  air  ions  are 

collected, there is no change in conduction current with voltage. This is the flat region 

on Figure 3.1, known as saturation, when the Gerdien only counts the total number of 

ions.  Outside  the  saturation  region  there  should  be  an  approximately  Ohmic 

relationship between bias voltage and measured current, depicted as the straight line 

in Figure 3.1. To see a true Ohmic relationship there would need to be a unimodal ion 

mobility spectrum; in reality, changes in the mobility spectrum cause slight variations 

in the conductivity at different voltages (as mentioned in Section 2.2.2). The best way 

to  maintain  Ohm(cid:146)s  law  is  to  ensure  the  Gerdien  is  sufficiently  ventilated,  since  the 

critical mobility is directly proportional to the flow rate (MR, 1998).

In Chapter 2, tube material was discussed briefly. The literature suggests no scientific 

reasons  to  prefer  one  metal  in  particular,  although  it  seems  sensible  to  start  with  a 

material  that  has  previously  been  used  successfully.  Aluminium  tubes  were  used  by 

Hatakayema  et  al  (1958)  and  Venkiteshwaran  (1958),  and  for  the  Gerdien  tested  in 

this  chapter,  aluminium  was  initially  chosen  for  the  outer  electrode  because  of  its 

workability.  The  central  electrode  was  made  of  stainless  steel  wire.  A  second 

aluminium  cylinder,  which  was  earthed,  was  used  as  a  screen 

to  reduce

electromagnetic interference. The outer electrode and screen were insulated from each 

other with a PVC separator. The tube dimensions are tabulated below, and Figure 3.2

bent  at  right  angles  and  soldered  directly  to  the  inner  of  the  BNC.  The  outer  of  the 

BNC was earthed to the screen. 

b) bias voltage connection (cid:150) BNC B in Figure 3.2 

This BNC connects to the bias voltage supply to provide a potential across the outer 

and central electrodes. 

The central electrode has to be particularly well insulated from other possible current 

paths, because it conveys the ion current, which is so small that great care has to be 

taken  to  avoid  leakage.  One  of  the  highest  quality  insulators  available  today  is 
Teflon25, with a  volume resistivity exceeding 1018 ‚Ñ¶cm (Keithley, 1992). Additional 

beneficial properties are that it is hydrophobic, repels surface contaminants and, when 

compared  to  other  high  performance  insulators  such  as  sapphire,  it  is  inexpensive 

(Keithley,  1992).  For  these  reasons,  Teflon  has  been  deployed  for  high  quality 

insulation in the Gerdien tube. Insulating the end of the central electrode to the current 

amplifier connection, where there is no electrical connection but the electrode needs 

to  be  supported,  is  crucial.  A  small  cylinder  of  Teflon  with  a  hole  drilled  in  it,  to 

wedge the central electrode in, was used at the inlet end, with a cross-support of thin 

wire wrapped around the insulator and wedged between the PVC supports.

The insulated end of the central electrode is at the Gerdien inlet. It is important that 

the disturbance to the air entering the tube is minimised to reduce turbulence, whilst 

ensuring charge does not accumulate on the insulator and perturb the electric field at 

the inlet. For these reasons, an electrically floating metallic cap with rounded edges in 

a  (cid:147)bullet(cid:148)  shape  was  attached  to  the  insulator  at  the  end  of  the  central  electrode  to 

protect it, whilst keeping the flow into the tube as smooth as possible.  

3.1.2  Flow rates  
The critical mobility (derived in Section 2.2.2) is determined by the ratio of flow rate 

where k is a constant (with dimensions of length) related to the physical dimensions of 

the tube: outer electrode radius a, central electrode radius b and tube length L, as

As can be seen from Figure 3.3, the critical mobility varies considerably with V and u.  

The flow rate and bias voltage therefore need to be selected in order to measure the 

required  critical  mobilities.  It  is  clear  that  some  source  of  external  ventilation  is 

required  to  prevent  the  tube  saturating  and  operating  in  the  ion  counter  mode  for 

periods  of  low  wind  speeds,  for  example  during  testing  in  the  laboratory.  The  bias 

voltage has to be chosen once the average flow in the tube has been estimated.

For  the  Gerdien  used  here,  a  small  electric  fan  in  a  cylindrical  plastic  casing26  was 

inserted  in  one  end  of  the  tube  to  ventilate  it.  If  the  polarity  is  reversed  when 

connecting it to the supply, air can alternatively be sucked through the tube, passing 

through  the  fan  after  the  electrodes.  This  is  preferable  to  measurements  being  made 

from  air  that  has  already  been  disturbed  by  the  fan.  Previous  conductivity 

measurement do not always state the direction of ventilation, but since many of them 

had the Gerdien located inside a building or at a window, they would have needed to 

suck air through the tube (e.g. Higazi and Chalmers, 1966).  

 
The  flow  rate  in  the  Gerdien  was  measured  with  a  hot  wire  anemometer27  inside  a 

cardboard tube of similar dimensions to the Gerdien, ventilated with the fan. A 12V 
supply gave a flow rate of about 2.2 ms-1. The bias voltages were selected based on 

this, using a reversible, variable voltage supply constructed from ten 12 V batteries to 

provide  Gerdien  voltages  in  the  range  12-120 V  with  a  ten-way  switch.    This  was

voltages were needed, a battery or millivolt calibrator could be used. 

 

 

 

Chalmers  (1967)  explains  the  need  for  Ohm(cid:146)s  Law  to  apply  in  conductivity 

measurements, as a way of ensuring that the ion current never totally depletes the ion 

concentration  in  the  air  near  the  electrodes.  Chalmers  (1967)  defines  a  criterion  to 

maintain Ohm(cid:146)s Law: the streamlines of the fluid flow (in this case, the fluid referred 

to is ionised air) in a ventilated tube must be parallel to the electrodes, which implies 

that  the  flow  must  be  laminar  (Tritton,  1988).  Otherwise,  Chalmers  (1967)  believes 

the  decay  of  charge  from  the  condenser  may  not  follow  the  classical  exponential 

formation in Eq. 2.3, from which the conductivity by the Voltage Decay method and 
direct current measurement can be derived28. Perfectly laminar flow will be difficult 

to maintain in a Gerdien tube, because of the ventilation requirement. The transition 

to turbulent flow (i.e. random and chaotic fluctuations of turbulent eddies in the fluid) 

can be defined in terms of the Reynolds number, Re, which is given by 

=Re

œÅ
suL
Œ∑

 

Eq. 3.3 

(e.g.  Tritton,  1988)  where  œÅ  is  the  fluid  density,  Œ∑  the  fluid  viscosity,  Ls  a 

characteristic length scale and u the mean flow speed. Since turbulence starts to occur 
at Re ‚àº 103, then for a Gerdien of comparable dimensions to the one used here (length 
25 cm, radius 2 cm), the flow will be turbulent for speeds exceeding about 0.1 ms-1, 

which are likely to be insufficient to measure conductivity. Chalmers(cid:146) (1967) criterion 

therefore seems approximate. 

Consider  the  motion  of  ions  in  the  tube;  in  a  perfectly  laminar  flow  they  will  be 

subject to two forces only. An electrical force will act towards the central electrode, 

and the mean flow will blow the ions along the tube. In turbulent flow there is a third 

effect  from  the  action  of  turbulent  eddies,  which  introduce  a  chaotic  aspect  into  the 

ionic motion. As long as the mean flow exceeds the scale of the turbulent eddies, the 

ionic  motion  predicted  by  theory  (resulting  most  importantly  in  the  critical  mobility 

Eq.  2.11)  should  still  hold.  In  terms  of  the  design  of  a  Gerdien  condenser,  the

described in Section 2.2.2 

Chapter 3

condition of laminar flow imposed by Chalmers (1967) can be relaxed, as long as it 

can be proved that the mean flow exceeds the motion due to turbulent eddies.  

 

 

 

3.1.3  Measuring the ion signal 
Eq.  2.17  gives  the  relationship  between  ion  current  i,  Gerdien  bias  voltage  V  and 

capacitance C as  

œÉ =

Œµ
io
CV

 

Eq. 3.4. 

If typical values of atmospheric conductivity are 10 fSm-1, the Gerdien bias voltage is 

20 V and its capacitance is 10 pF, then substituting into Eq. 2.17 suggests that typical 

Gerdien  currents  from  an  instrument  of  that  specification  will  be  ~ 200  fA  in 
magnitude29.  The  small  magnitude  of  these  currents  implies  that  a  specialist 

electrometer is necessary. Commercially available instruments exist with resolution of 

1 fA, such as the Keithley 6512, but these are bulky and expensive calibration devices 

unsuited to fieldwork. When measuring such small currents, effects often considered 

negligible  in  other  circumstances  are  comparable  to  the  signal,  such  as  leakage 

currents,  and  also  the  50 Hz  interference  caused  by  the  ac  mains  supply.  Great  care 

therefore  has  to  be  taken  to  minimise  these  problems  whilst  maximising  the  time 

response,  by  careful  design  and  component  selection,  as  in  the  current  amplifier 

developed by Harrison (1997a).  

Measurement of the change in voltage across the Gerdien electrodes when the charge 

on them decays through air is more straightforward, and a simple follower circuit can 

minimise  leakage  currents  if  a  suitable  op-amp  is  chosen.  However,  the  currents 

flowing  are  clearly  no  larger  than  when  they  are  measured  directly  at  the  central 

electrode,  and  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode,  particular  attention  has  to  be  paid  to  the 

connections from the tube to the follower input to avoid leakage. This can be avoided 

by driving the screen of the input at the output potential, a method known as guarding 

(Horowitz and Hill, 1994). 

                                                           
29 Although Gerdiens used in the literature have varied considerably in size, their capacitance is usually 
of  order  10 pF  (e.g.  Arathoon,  1991;  Blakeslee  and  Krider,  1992).  Consequently,  the  currents  are 
usually  dependent  on  the  magnitude  of  the  bias  voltage,  which  is  chosen  based  on  critical  mobility 
considerations, indirectly related to the size of the instrument through the constant k defined in Eq. 3.4. 
Since  the  Gerdien  used  here  is  smaller  than  average,  this  results  in  smaller  output  currents  than 
measurements with larger Gerdien condensers.

A miniaturised Gerdien device 

 

 

A  current  amplifier is an instrument to measure a small current (Keithley, 1992) by 
converting  it  into  a  voltage,  which  is  usually  linearly  related  to  the  input  current30. 

The  simplest  form  of  i-to-V  converter  is  a  resistor:  for  example,  currents  of  1 pA 
could be converted into 1 V by passing them through a high value resistor of 1 T‚Ñ¶. 

However, a resistor is not ideal for current measurement because its time response is 

limited  by  the  time  constant  of  the  resistor  and  its  own  capacitance  (typically  a few 
pF).  With  the  high  value  resistors  of  order  1 T‚Ñ¶  required  to  measure  small  ion 

currents, this immediately implies a time response of order seconds. 

An  alternative  approach  is  to  utilise  the  properties  of  operational  amplifiers.  The 

output voltage of an op-amp is proportional to the potential difference at the inputs, 

with the constant of proportionality given by the gain (Keithley, 1992). In conjunction 

with a fixed resistance, operational amplifiers can also be used to convert current to 

voltage. There are two configurations in which op-amps can act as i-to-V converters, 
shunt and feedback31.

Figure 3.4 Ammeters using op-amps, after Keithley (1992). RF and RS are the large 

value resistors. i is input current, Vo is output. Note that for the shunt ammeter (a), the 

signal joins the non-inverting input, and for the feedback ammeter (b), the inverting 

 

input. 

 
In the shunt ammeter (Figure 3.4a), the output voltage Vo is given by the expression 

for a non-inverting amplifier with an input voltage iRs, i.e.: 

                                                           
30  It  is  also  possible  to  make  a  logarithmic  current  amplifier  (Keithley,  1992)  by  using  a  logarithmic 
feedback element. They are well suited to measuring currents in a wide range, for example atmospheric 
point discharge currents in fair weather and  thunderstorms.

Eq. 3.5. 

Eq. 3.6. 

In the feedback ammeter (Figure 3.4b), the output voltage is related to the current i by 

(Keithley, 1992). The shunt ammeter suffers from a similarly limited time response to 

the resistor described above because the input capacitance and any stray capacitance 

are in parallel with the shunt resistor RS (Arathoon, 1991). The feedback ammeter is 

preferable  because  the  op-amp‚Äôs  high  gain  means  that  negative  feedback  keeps  the 

inverting input as a virtual earth. As the non-inverting input is grounded, the voltage 

across the inputs is very small so there is virtually no input capacitance, and the time 

constant is only limited by the feedback resistor RF and its stray capacitance. 

The  feedback  current  amplifier  used  in  this  application  was  developed  by  Harrison 

(1997a).  It  was  designed  specifically  for  atmospheric  current  measurements,  and 

incorporates a 30dB 50 Hz noise-rejection feature which uses a tuned filter to extract 

the 50 Hz signal, phase-shift it by 180(cid:176), and feed it back to the input to cancel it out. It 

also  includes  several  features  to  minimise  leakage  currents;  the  input  connection  is 

soldered directly to the op-amp inverting input.  

 
Harrison‚Äôs (1997a) original current amplifier design had a feedback resistor of 1 G‚Ñ¶. 

Initial  measurements  showed  that  the  Gerdien  currents  measured  in  the  laboratory 

were  smaller  than  expected,  probably  due  to  ion-deficient  indoor  air.  One  possible 

solution would be to add a further op-amp with gain A to increase the total sensitivity 

of the system

depicted  in  Figure  3.5.  If  A = -100,  and  RF = 1 G‚Ñ¶,  then  the  output  is  nominally 

1V/pA. Another approach, which has the same overall effect on the gain, would be to 
increase the feedback resistor to 1 T‚Ñ¶, omitting the second gain stage or having A = -

1. "Gain trimming" is the process of adjusting A to get the desired response. 

Eq. 3.7.

The  principal  difference  between  the  two  options  is  one  of  temperature  stability.  In 

practice,  there  exists  an  input  offset  voltage  Vos,  which  is  a  consequence  of  the 

potential  across  the  terminals  of  the  input  amplifier  not  being  exactly  zero;  Vos  is 

defined as the voltage required at the input to cancel it at the output (Keithley, 1992). 

There  is  also  an  input  bias  current  iB  which  is  defined  as  the  average  of  the  input 

currents with the inputs shorted together. Physically, the input currents result from the 

base leakage currents of the input transistors (Horowitz and Hill, 1994). The effects of 

input offset voltage and input bias current are both magnified by the second op-amp(cid:146)s 

gain A, thus the total response V0 of the system is:

RF,  iB  and  Vos  all  have  a  temperature  dependence,  with  higher  value  resistors  being 

more  variable  with  temperature.  (Resistor  temperature  dependencies  are  shown  in 
Table 3.2 below, where it can be seen that a 1 T‚Ñ¶ resistor is 70 % more temperature 

sensitive  than  a  1 G‚Ñ¶  resistor.)  The  change  in  the  output  voltage  ‚àÜV  for  a  finite

There  is  thus  a  compromise  between  using  a  1 G‚Ñ¶  resistor  with  a  larger  gain  stage

dependence  but  no  multiplication  of  Vos.  The  change  of  input  bias  current  with

The temperature sensitivity of the output voltage was calculated for different values of 

feedback  resistance,  varying  the  gain  to  keep  the  response  nominally  1V/pA,  by 

substituting data from Table 3.2 into Eq. 3.9 above. 

 
Figure  3.6  shows  that  increasing  the  value  of  the  feedback  resistor  decreases  the 
overall  temperature  sensitivity  of  the  current  amplifier.  With  the  1 G‚Ñ¶  feedback 

resistor,  the  term  where  the  input  offset  voltage  is  multiplied  by  the  gain  in Eq. 3.9 

dominates, with the error increasing for smaller currents. For larger resistors, the first 

term in Eq. 3.9 dominates, improving the overall thermal stability despite the greater 

sensitivity of the larger resistors to temperature changes.

Figure  3.6  Temperature  sensitivity  of  the  output  voltage  with  Rf  for  typical  input 

currents from atmospheric ions (shown in pA in the legend), calculated from Eq. 3.9. 

Comparisons  were  made  of  the  temperature  stability  of  a  current  amplifier  using  a 
1 T‚Ñ¶ feedback resistor with two different electrometer grade op-amps: 
‚Ä¢  AD549JH (which has the ‚àÜVos/‚àÜT = 10 ¬µV/‚ÄùC as the MAX406), which was used 
successfully  by  Arathoon  (1991)  in  a  feedback  current  amplifier  with  a  100G‚Ñ¶ 

feedback resistor. 

‚Ä¢  MAX406, used in the Harrison (1997a) current amplifier.  

Using the AD549JH compared to the MAX406 would reduce the input bias current at 
0 ¬∞C by an order of magnitude, but increase it by a factor of two at 30 ¬∞C. Since the 

two op-amps are otherwise similar, the more consistent value of iB is preferable as it is 

easier to quantify. 

 
Following  the  analysis  of  temperature  dependencies  of  input  bias  current  and  input 

offset  voltage,  the  MAX406  op-amp  was  unchanged  from  the  original  design 
(Harrison,  1997a),  but  the  feedback  resistor was changed to a 1 T‚Ñ¶ with the second 

stage having a gain of -1.

The  thermal stability of the current amplifier‚Äôs leakage terms were tested by logging 

its  output  when  its  input  was  capped,  at  the  Reading  University  Meteorology  Field 

Site. In this configuration, the output is from the combination of the input bias current 

and  leakage  currents  from  the  current  amplifier,  and  shows  a  clear  temperature 

dependence  which  can  be  seen  in  Figure  3.7.  The  predicted  effect  of  changes  in 

temperature  on  the  input  bias  current  alone  is  plotted  in  Figure  3.8.  Although  the 

MAX406  has  a  small  input  bias  current  compared  to  other  op-amps,  if  typical  ion 

currents are about 200 fA, then the input bias current introduces an error of about 5 %, 

and in indoor tests this will probably be worse because of the higher temperatures and 

smaller ion concentration.

Figure 3.8 Variation of the typical MAX406 input bias current with temperature (from 

manufacturer(cid:146)s data sheet). 

Both  these  effects  will  vary  with  the  individual  op-amp  used,  and  Figure  3.8  in 

particular  is  likely  to  be  the  worst  case  scenario  quoted  by  the  manufacturer. 

However, it is clear that the temperature dependence of both the input bias current and 

the  electrometer  leakage  current  are  significant  effects  when  measuring  at  the 
femtoampere  level.  The    observed  current  amplifier  resolution  of  ¬± 3 fA  at 20 ‚ÄùC  33, 

concurs with the trend in the sum of leakage and input bias currents shown in Figure 

3.7, but the results suggest the leakage currents will be greater at lower temperatures. 
The  atmospheric  results  (measured  at  2 (cid:150) 12 ‚ÄùC)  support  this;  because  ib  is  positive, 

then the leakage currents in the circuit must be dominant to make the overall response 

negative. 

3.1.4  Switching devices in electrometry 
When a switch is required, for example in the Voltage Decay method to control the 

bias  voltage,  great  care  has  again  to  be  taken  to  avoid  leakage  currents by choosing 

well-insulated  components.  For  this  reason,  sub-miniature  glass  encapsulated  reed

switches34 in a activating electromagnetic coil35 were used for low leakage switching 

applications.  For  the  Gerdien  system,  the  major  applications  were  shorting  out  the 

current  amplifier‚Äôs  feedback  resistor,  and  controlling  the  voltage  which  charges  the 

electrodes. 

 
This reed relay, cycling at 0.1 Hz, was used to short out the feedback resistor in the 

current  amplifier,  with  its  input  floating  and  screened.  When  the  relay  opened  there 

was a voltage transient of about 30 mV (corresponding to a negative charge injection 

of  ~ 6 fC)  into  the  system.  This  exhibited  a  RC  decay  with  a  settling  time  of 

approximately 5 s. Brownlee (1973) observed a similar 20 mV transient with the ERG 

type  MA/GO/J  reed  relays  he  was  using  to  switch  between  connections  to  his 

electrometer. To test whether this effect was a property of the relay he compared the 

voltage  transients  using  different  capacitor  values  across  the  reed  relay.  From  Eq. 

(2.5),  if  q  does  not  vary  with  time,  then  doubling  the  capacitance  should  halve  the 

voltage  transient.  Brownlee  (1973)  concluded  from  this  that  his  relays  injected  a 

charge  of  about  20 fC  into  the  system.  This  confirms  suspicions  that  the  reed  has  a 
small capacitance, and discharges when closed, which can cause transients36. To avoid 

this charge injection affecting the current measurements, a suitable decay time should 

be allowed to elapse after the relay switching, before making a measurement.  

 

Another test of the reed relay, when connected across the current amplifier feedback 

resistor, was to subject it to step changes in input current when it was fixed either on 

or off, and observe the effect on its switching capabilities. When the relay was open, 

changes in the input current greater than from +1 to (cid:150)1 pA could cause it to jam in the 

off  (open)  position.  A  possible  explanation  for  this  could  be  that  as  the  op-amp  is 

inverting, the feedback voltage is of the opposite sign to the input current, but at the 

instant  when  the  sign  of  the  input  current  is  changed,  the  input  and  the  feedback 

potentials  on  the  reeds  are    the  same  sign.  The  repulsion  between  the  reed  and  its 

input  means  that  there  is  nowhere  for  the  charge  on  the  relay  to  dissipate  to,  which 

could  cause  it  to  stick  open.  This  would  probably  be  an  insignificant  problem  in 

atmospheric measurements, because step changes of order 2 pA with a change of sign,

long-term reliability of the relay switching. 

3.2  Characterisation  of  individual  components  of  the  Gerdien 

system 

In  this  section,  the  individual  components  of  the  Gerdien  system  are  investigated. 

Some wind tunnel experiments to identify the flow r√ògime in the tube were carried out 

and are described in Section 3.2.1. The findings of the flow investigation suggest that 

fluctuations  in  the  external  ventilation  may  be  important,  necessitating  further 

consideration  of  its  effects  on  the  size  of  ions  contributing  to  the  measurement  in 

Section  3.2.2.  The  measurement  system  has  also  been  studied  in  detail,  and  the 

findings are presented in Section 3.2.3. 

3.2.1  Flow properties of air in the Gerdien tube 
The  aim  of  the  experiments  described  in  this  section  were  to  determine  some 

characteristics of the flow in the Gerdien tube, in particular how the flow in the tube 

varied with the nature of the external flow. It is also necessary to confirm that flow in 

the  tube  is  approximately  laminar,  so  classical  Gerdien  theory  (Chalmers,  1967) 

would apply (as discussed in Section 3.1.2). 

The  flow  properties  of  the  tube  were  investigated  by  making  measurements  with  a 

Disa type 56C01 hot-wire anemometer in a wind tunnel. The tube used was physically 

identical  in  dimensions  and  composition  to  a  Gerdien  condenser,  but  lacked  the 

electrical  connections.  Measurements  were  made  when  the  external  ventilation  was 

sucking  air  through  the  Gerdien  in  the  same  direction as the fan, and also when the 

external and  induced ventilation (from the fan) were opposed. The probe was inserted 

33.5 mm into the Gerdien, to measure the flow adjacent to the central electrode.

The relationship between the flow in the tube and the external ventilation can be used 

to  empirically  determine  utube  from  the  measured  wind  component.  Three  r√ògimes 

were investigated, which are summarised below in Table 3.3. The first case was when 

the  external  ventilation  exceeded  the  fan  speed  so  that  it  dominated  the  flow  in  the 

tube,  the  second  when  the  external  ventilation  was  low  so  that  the  fan  was  the 

principal  component  of  the  flow,  and  the  third  when  the  flows  were  approximately 

equal and opposite. Only wind speeds in the typical atmospheric range were chosen, 

so that the study would be as applicable as possible.

Eq. 3.10 

Eq. 3.11 

To calculate utube for atmospheric air, the external wind component is calculated from 

the wind speed and direction. If it is negative, then the flow is opposed to the direction 
of the fan flow, and Eq. 3.10 is used to give utube ‚Äì 0.1 ms-1. If it is positive then the 

aligned wind speed is substituted into Eq. 3.11, with a slight associated error in utube ‚Äì 
0.04 ms-1. 

The  Reynolds  number  Re  (Eq.  3.3)  was  calculated  for  the  length  scale  of  the  tube 

diameter (0.04 m), since this indicates the scale of motion of the ions when they enter 

the tube. Turbulence of this length scale is important, because if it is too vigorous the 

motion  of  the  ions towards the central electrode will be significantly perturbed. The 

results, in Table 3.3, show that the flow in the tube is at the lower limit for the onset 
of turbulence, which starts when Re ‚âà 103, depending on the exact geometry and flow 
characteristics (Tritton, 1988). This suggests that the flow in the tube is only slightly 

turbulent,  if  at  all,  so  the  (cid:147)relaxed  Chalmers  criterion(cid:148)  discussed  in  section  3.1.2 

holds,  although  some  noise  may  be  introduced  into  the  measurements  from 

fluctuations in the flow. From the values of Re for different flow conditions, it appears 

as if the fan is primarily responsible for introducing some more turbulent flow (with 

higher Re), but when the fan and external wind are equal and opposite, then this effect 

is  reduced.  The  difference,  however,  is  insufficient  to  justify  eliminating  data  based 

on wind speed variations alone. 

 

 

 

 

3.2.2  A simplified relationship between critical mobility and maximum radius  
It is clear from Figure 3.10 that the flow inside the tube is not linearly related to the 

external  ventilation.  This  has  consequences  for  the  critical  mobility  of  ion 

contributing to the measurement, which is a function of the flow in the tube, as shown 

in  Eq.  3.1.  The  non-linear  relationship  between  the  external  and  internal  ventilation 

implies  it  is  important  to  calculate  the  critical  mobility  in  the  tube,  because  small

critical mobility.  

 

Some flow rates may be inappropriate because the critical mobility is not in a suitable 

range  for  conductivity  measurement  (see  Section  2.2.2).  Theoretical  predictions 

(Dhanorkar  and  Kamra,  1997)  show  that  if  intermediate  ions  are  contributing  to  the 

conductivity, then classical ion-aerosol theory (outlined in Section 2.2.3 and described 

in  more  detail  in  Clement  and  Harrison  (1992))  does  not  hold.  Ion  mobility  varies 

inversely, but non-linearly with ion mass and radius and intermediate ions are defined 

as having radii ~ 1 nm (Hƒ±rrak et al, 1999). Since mobility is not the most intuitive of 

quantities  to  relate  to  other  physical  properties  of  an  ion,  it  is  desirable  to  find  a 

simple  way  to  convert  between  ion  mass  and  radius.  Tammet  (1995)  has  derived  a 

complicated expression to relate the two quantities, which has been simplified for use 

in  this  Thesis.  Ion  size  and  mobility  data  (calculated  using  Tammet(cid:146)s  (1995) 

expression) have been given in Hƒ±rrak et al (1999), and are plotted below. A power 

law fit has been applied which gives a simple way to relate ion mobility to radius.

Critical  mobility  is  defined  as  the  minimum  mobility  of  ion  contributing  to  the 

Gerdien measurement. The inverse relationship between it and radius means that the 

maximum radius of ion contributing to the measurement can be known. This permits 

easy  conversion  between  ionic  mobility  and  radius,  so  there  can  be  continual 

awareness of more intuitively understood physical properties. It is therefore easier to 

select  filtering  criteria,  for  example,  based  on  flow  considerations,  to  exclude  the 

effect of intermediate ions on the conductivity measurement.

The  current  amplifier  was  calibrated  in  the  laboratory  using  a  resistive  method  of 
generating  small  currents  with  a  millivolt  calibrator37  and  a  1 T‚Ñ¶  resistor.  From 

Figure 3.12 it is clear that for this current amplifier, the dc response is linear to 99%

The  current  amplifier  resolution  was  ¬± 3fA,  and  a  Fourier  power  spectrum  of  its 

output  when  connected  to  a  current  source  showed  that  the  dominant  component  of 

the  noise  was  mains  at  50Hz,  although  attenuation  resulted  from  the  50 Hz  reject 
feature (Harrison, 1997a). A RC low pass filter with œÑ = 2 Hz (1 M‚Ñ¶, 220 nF) across 

the  output  was  used  to  eliminate  high  frequency  variation  without  attenuating  the 

mean  signal,  although  when  computerised  data  logging  was  used  in  the  field, 

averaging reduced the need for this filter. 

 
Initial  atmospheric  tests  were  hindered  by  an  over-range  response  from  the  current 

amplifier  op-amp  saturating,  probably  due  to  an  excessive  leakage  current.  The 

saturation  periods  did  not  relate  to  any  of  the  meteorological  and  other  atmospheric 

electrical measurements made at the same time. The persistence of this response also 

increased  with  time,  indicating  a  progressively  developing  problem.  Possible  causes 

were investigated, and are discussed below. 

 

 

ac effects 

 
The  1T‚Ñ¶  feedback  resistor  used  is  at  the  upper  limit  of  commercially  available 

resistors,  and  such  a  value  is  infrequently  used,  except  in  electrometry.  If  there  is 
feedback  through  the  circuit  involving  a 180¬∞ phase shift, the circuit becomes an ac 

amplifier, with changes in the values of the capacitors in the circuit affecting the gain. 

If  this  occurs,  it  could  cause  an  amplification  of  any  resonance,  which  might 

submerge the true ionic conduction current in oscillation. 

To  investigate  this,  the  equivalent  circuit  of  the  Gerdien  and  current  amplifier  was 

constructed, and is shown in Figure 3.13. The Gerdien condenser was sealed with foil 

to  act  as  a  capacitor  with  very  high  (but  unknown)  resistance.  Its  resistance  should 

remain roughly constant since the only current in the tube would be from cosmic and 

gamma  background  ionisation.  Step  changes  in  currents  were  induced,  and  the 

capacitance across the Gerdien was also varied. Oscillations were clearly visible with 

step changes of the orders of magnitude that could be expected from atmospheric ions 

(e.g. 100-200 fA). This (cid:147)ringing(cid:148) indicated a resonance and hence an instability. The 

experiment was repeated with lower value resistors instead of the Gerdien, and there

each time a transient is induced. The x-axis scaling is 1 small square = 0.2 s. y-axis 

scaling is approximately 4 mV/small square (the total amplitude of the oscillation was 

about 10 % of the signal) 

 
The  oscillations  could  be  caused  by  the  parasitic  capacitance  across  the  op-amp,  or 

some effect due to the particular (and unusual) combination of low capacitances and 

very  high  resistances  in  the  circuit.  Keithley  (1992)  describes  a  circuit  which  can 

neutralise the capacitance across the op-amp. It adds another capacitor and resistor to 

the feedback loop, so that if their time constant is made to match the time constant of 

Chapter 3 

 

99 

A miniaturised Gerdien device 

the feedback resistor and its capacitance, then the effect is cancelled out. This circuit 

(known as a (cid:147)T-network(cid:148)) was added, and removed the instability, appearing stable in 

the  long  term.  However,  the  step  changes  imposed  in  the  laboratory  to  cause  this 

effect  are  unlikely  to  occur  in  practice,  because  they  would  require  an  extremely 

sudden  and  rapid  change  in  the  ionic composition of the air. Fluctuations in the ion 

production  rate  may  be  rapid,  but  are  unlikely  to  cause  a  doubling  of  the  ion 

concentration  because  the  effects  of  self-recombination  and  attachment  act  to  damp 

the changes. The ventilation of the Gerdien tube also acts to smooth the effect of ionic 

fluctuations.  Other  ac  effects  which  might  have  been  responsible  for  the  over-range 

output were investigated in detail, but this was the most conclusive finding. 

Effect of tube material 

 

 

The  Gerdiens  were  regularly  cleaned  with  isopropanol,  but  this  process  was 

inadequate at the end of the tube with the fan sealed watertight into it. Accumulation 

of dirt on the electrodes and insulators could provide an effective current leakage path 

and  result  in  the  progressive  degradation  observed.  Aluminium  surfaces,  like  the 

Gerdien tube(cid:146)s outer electrode, become permanently coated with a layer of Al2O3 on 

exposure  to  air,  so  chemical  processes  occurring  on  the  electrodes  are  not 

inconceivable.  Previous  aluminium  Gerdiens  were  only  used  for  radiosonde  ascents 

(Hatakayema et al, 1958; Venkiteshwaran, 1958), which typically last for a few hours, 

so it is difficult to compare them to long-term deterioration of Gerdiens running in the 

field. 

  

As W(cid:229)hlin (1986) suggests that contact potentials cause differences in the offsets of 

the  Ohmic  response  plot  for  Gerdien  tubes  (discussed  in  section  2.2.1),  the  Ohmic 

response of several Gerdien tubes of different materials was tested in the laboratory. 

The same current amplifier was used throughout.

Even  when  the  Gerdien  was  clean,  the  current  amplifier  would  frequently  record  a 

current exceeding 2 pA. This behaviour was repeatable, typically starting in the early 

evening and lasting until the next morning, and a typical day showing this pattern is 

depicted  in  Figure  3.16.  These  periods  correlated  well  with  high  relative  humidity, 

and it was possible to predict their onset when the relative humidity exceeded about 

75 %.  This  was  thought  to  be  due  to  condensation  onto  the  insulators  or  electrodes 

causing an excessive leakage current.

The  Gerdien  system  (in  Current  Measurement  mode)  has  been  used  for  two  test 

applications: measurement of the conductivity variation with aerosol concentration at 

a  semi-rural  site  near  Reading  (Section  3.3.1),  and  calibration  against  the  ion 

production rate in clean air (Section 3.3.2). Finally, (in Section 3.3.3) air conductivity 

is  measured  by  the  Current  Measurement  and  Voltage  Decay  modes  with  the  same 

Gerdien condenser, and the results are compared.

3.3.1  Measuring physical properties of ions with the Gerdien system 
In  an  aerosol-ion  system  such  as  the  atmosphere  at  Reading,  the  concentration  of 

atmospheric  small  ions  is  related  to  aerosol  concentrations,  as  discussed  in  Section 
2.2.2.  The  values  of  Œ±,Œ≤  and  q  in  Eq.  2.27  were  estimated  manually  using  a  least 

squares  method,  to  minimise  residuals  within  a  sensible  range.  This  enables  the 

aerosol  concentration  to  be  calculated  from  conductivity  measurements.  The  aerosol 

mass  concentration  was  measured  using  an  optical  instrument,  the  TSI  8520 
DustTrak38 and converted to a number concentration. The direct conversion of aerosol 

mass  to  number  concentration  can  only  be  an  approximation,  since  it  assumes  a 

monodisperse aerosol concentration of spherical particles of constant density.

A miniaturised Gerdien device 

The  conductivity  curve  calculated  from  Eq.  2.27,  (having  fitted  for  Œ±, Œ≤  and  q)  is  a 

tolerable match to the measurements, but the paucity of conductivity data and its large 

spread  of  values  indicate  that  significant  improvements  to  the  Gerdien  system  were 
needed. The fitted values of the coefficients were Œ± ‚âà 10-14 m3s-1, Œ≤ ‚âà 10-13 m3s-1, and 

q  ‚âà  5  ion  pairs  cm-3s-1,  which  are  up  to  two  orders  of  magnitude  away  from  the 

textbook values of Œ± ‚âà 1.6 x 10-12 m3s-1, Œ≤ ‚âà 1.4 x 10-12 m3s-1 (Clement and Harrison, 

1992)  and  q  ‚âà  10  ion  pairs  cm-3s-1  (Chalmers,  1967),  again  suggesting  problematic 

measurements. There may be other explanations for the difficulties encountered with 
quantifying the œÉ-Z relationship. For example, the DustTrak is unlikely to give a true 

picture of the aerosol concentration because of the approximation required to convert 

mass  into  number  concentrations,  and  its  cutoff  size  (10  nm)  may  exclude  smaller 

particles  participating 
ion-aerosol  attachment.  There  are  also  suggestions 
(Dhanorkar and Kamra, 1997) that aerosol concentrations exceeding 1010 m-3, as seen 

in 

here, may invalidate the expected inverse relationship. Other experiments measuring 

aerosol  and  conductivity  (Guo  et  al,  1996)  showed  a  large  scatter  in  the  fit,  which 

may also be expected for this case. However, these effects can not be considered until 

the Gerdien data is improved.  

 

 

3.3.2  Calibration in clean air 
A further test on the Gerdien system is to compare its readings with the source rate of 

ions,  which  is  principally  from  local  radioactivity.  The  complicating  effect  of  ion 

removal by aerosol can be reduced if these measurements are made in clean air, (see 

Section 2.2.3, particularly Eq. 2.20) for which reason the measurements were made at 

Mace Head, W. Ireland, in summer 1999. In the recombination limit, when the aerosol 

concentration is negligible, the ion concentration depends only on the square root of 

the ion production rate, q, as in Eq. 2.20. Classical work (Chalmers, 1967) suggests 

that  alpha-radiation  due  to  Radon  isotopes  measurable  with  a  Geiger  counter, 

comprises a significant fraction of q at the surface.  

A  ZP1410  Geiger  tube  operated  at  a  bias  voltage  of  550 ‚Äì 5 V,  in  the  plateau  of  its 

sensitivity curve, was located approximately 5 m away from the Gerdien condenser, at 

                                                                                                                                                                      
38  This  measures  aerosol  particles  with  a  radius  greater  than  0.01¬µm  to  ‚Äì 0.001 ¬µgm-3  or ‚Äì  1%  (TSI, 
1994).

Current  Measurement  and  time  decay  methods  (left  axis).  The  ratio  of  positive  to

Results  for  the  air  conductivity  obtained  from  both  methods  are  consistent,  with  a 

positive correlation of 0.43. Experimental error in the Current Measurement method is  

‚Äì  20 %,  due  to  the  error  in  the capacitance determination of the Gerdien condenser. 

The  error  in  the  Voltage  Decay  method  is  more  difficult  to  quantify,  because  the 

Chapter 3 

 

107 

A miniaturised Gerdien device 

validity  of  the  exponential  assumption  is  not  known.  The  voltage  and  time  values 

were  obtained  manually  from  the  chart  recorder  trace,  which  may  contribute  further 

error; therefore the uncertainty is likely to be comparable to or greater than the error 

in the Current Measurement results. The conductivities calculated by the two methods 

agree to within the errors in the measurements, except when there is a slightly greater 

discrepancy between 9 and 12 June 1998. Much of this is probably accounted for by 

variations  in  flow  speeds  within  the  tubes,  and  the  effects  of  wind  direction  on  the 

sampling  orifice.  Average  conductivity  from  the  Current  Measurement  mode  was 
5 fSm-1, which is in agreement with similar measurements (e.g. Blakeslee and Krider, 

1992, see also Table 2.1). 

3.4  Conclusions 

In this chapter each of the Gerdien system components has been analysed. The current 

amplifier‚Äôs  response  has  been  optimised  for  low  errors  due  to  leakage,  and  some 

disadvantages  of  the  original  tube  material  were  found.  Investigation  of  leakage 

currents and thermal stability show some temperature-dependent effects. The Voltage 

Decay  method  as  an  alternative  mode  of  conductivity  measurement  has  also  been 

successfully deployed and results from the two methods agreed. Measurements of the 

relationship  between  conductivity  and  aerosol  were  successful  to  an  order  of 

magnitude,  and  calibration  in  clean  air  accords  with  theoretical  predictions.  This 

suggests  the  techniques  used  can  be  independently  validated,  but  their  accuracy  and 

reliability would benefit from refinement.

4  A switched mobility Gerdien ion counter 

 
 
In  this  chapter,  a  microcontroller  is  integrated  with  the  Gerdien  device  described  in 

Chapter 3. This permits the ion counter to measure currents from ions at two different 

critical  mobilities.  The  reasoning  behind  this  particular  development  strategy  is 

explained in Section 4.1. An overview of the computer-controlled, bimobility Gerdien 

system is described in Section 4.2. 

 
4.1  Justification and strategy 

One of the conclusions of  Chapter 3  was that the Gerdien device can measure ions in 

two  modes  of  operation,  a  configuration  which  is  clearly  advantageous  for  self-

consistency checking. However, the tests were labour-intensive, and required manual 

operation with results obtained from a chart recorder trace. Introducing some sort of 

computer  control  would  reduce  these  data  logging  difficulties,  and  other  benefits  of 

such  a  system  would  greatly improve it. For example, it would be relatively easy to 

switch  between  voltages  to  measure  two  mobilities  of  ion  with  some  binary  control 

capability.  Running  the  Gerdien  switching  in  this  way  would  also  circumvent  the 

over-range problems, which took some hours to start. Computer control was preferred 

because it would allow great flexibility in different modes of operation, for example 

running  the  Gerdien  in  the  voltage  decay  mode,  carrying  out  basic  data  processing, 

logging 

to  a  PC  and  switching  between 

ion  polarities  and  mobilities.  A 

microcontroller  was  chosen  because  of  its  low  cost,  ease  of  incorporation  into 

electronic circuits and ability to support serial communication with the PC.

4.2.1  Analogue to digital converter 
An analogue to digital converter (ADC) was necessary to convert the output voltage 

from  the  picoammeter  into  a  digital  format  suitable  for  serial  communication.  The 

LTC1298 12-bit ADC (IC1 in Figure 4.2) was used in single-ended mode, controlled 

by  two  serial  lines  from  pins  2  and  3 of the microcontroller. A stable 2.5 V voltage 
reference (measured at 2.51995 ¬± 0.00005V) is added to the current amplifier output 

voltage before the ADC input, to ensure that bipolar ion currents can be recorded. 

The  level  shift  was  tested  by  measuring  the  picoammeter  output  voltage  accurately 

with a Keithley 6512 electrometer before and after the shift stages. It was constant to 
¬± 0.05mV for  (cid:150)2 < iin < +2 pA. For larger positive voltages the level shift decreases 

and  for  smaller  negative  voltages  the  level  shift  increases,  such  that  the  ADC  input 

voltage  tends  to  constant  values  of  approximately  +5 V  or  (cid:150)  75 mV.  The  computer 

logging  system  records  over  range  values  of  4095  or  0  respectively  when  the  ADC 

receives these inputs. The ADC was calibrated by supplying it with known voltages 

from  a  millivolt  calibrator,  and  the  output  counts  were  serially  sent  to  a  PC;  the 

calibration graph is Figure 4.3 below.

the microcontroller. One relay (a changeover device) was connected to two batteries 

to  provide  positive  (+9 V)  and  negative  (-6 V)  bias  voltages  for  the  Gerdien 

condenser.  The  other  relay  was  connected  across  the  feedback  resistor  of  the 

picoammeter  to  short  out  the  picoammeter  feedback  resistor.  When  activated,  this 

relay protects the picoammeter from the transients which occur immediately after the 

voltage is switched. 

 

4.2.3  Software 
Programs  were  written  to  control  and  test  each  component  individually  before  the 

system  was  tested  as  a  whole.  The  program  to  control  the  ADC  was  from  Parallax 

(1998)  with  some  modification.  The  separate  programs  controlling  the  ADC,  serial 

communication  and  relays  were  combined  to  make  the  overall  control  program, 

GNOCLOCK,  the  operation  of  which  is  outlined  in  Table  4.1.  The  source  code  is 

supplied in Appendix C.

was aligned with the flow.  The results are shown in Figure 4.4.

4.4  Conclusions 

A  simple  microcontrolled  system  has  been  tested  to  measure  ions  by  switching 

between  two  critical  mobilities  and  serially  output  the  data  to  a  PC.  This  is  a 

considerable improvement on the manual measurements described in Chapter 3, and 

means  the  instrument  can  be  effectively  deployed  for  remote  measurements  in  the 

field.  Encouraging  results also suggest that running the instrument at more than one 

critical  mobility  is  advantageous.  The  success  of  this  initial  microcontrolled  system 

means that it can be applied to the more complex problems of controlling the voltage 

decay mode and running both modes on one instrument.

5  The Programmable Ion Mobility Spectrometer 

 
 
Chapter  4  discussed  an  ion  measuring  device  using  an  elementary  switching 

arrangement 

to  select  different  critical  mobilities.  This  chapter  covers 

the 

development  and  testing  of  a  Programmable  Ion  Mobility  Spectrometer  (PIMS),  to 

permit  a  greater  flexibility  in  the  ion  measurements.  The  major  part  is  the 

development  of  a  new  multimode  electrometer  (MME),  which  in  addition  to 
measuring  small  currents44,  can  act  as  a  voltage  follower,  and  compensate  its  own 

error terms in software. This allows the use of Current and Voltage Decay modes in 

ion measurements. A further addition to the system described in Chapter 3 is digital-

to-analogue converter circuitry to add a range of programmable critical mobilities, by 
changing the bias voltage, in the Current Mode45.

5.5).  Section  5.6  discusses  the  two  other  MME  modes,  in  which  it  checks  its  own 

error  terms.  Section  5.7  describes  the  integration  of  the  Gerdien,  electronics  and 

microcontroller  to  comprise  the  PIMS  device.  Using  the  integrated  system,  the 

Gerdien condenser capacitance C is measured, using a precision voltage ramp initially 

developed  to  calibrate  current  measurements,  and  microcontroller  software  is 
developed.  Finally,  in  section  5.7.4,  a  preliminary  atmospheric  test  compares  œÉ

5.1  Motivation  

5.1.1  Limitations of other systems 
The microcontrolled Gerdien condenser system described in Chapter 3 has measured 

air ion concentrations as predicted by ion-aerosol theory (e.g. Clement and Harrison, 

1992), and all its components have been thoroughly tested and investigated. However, 

there were clearly some aspects in need of improvement. The system was unreliable at 

high  relative  humidities.  The  reason  for  this  effect  was  not  identified,  but  many 

possible  causes  were  ruled  out.  Aluminium  as  a  Gerdien  tube  material  was  not 

thought to be suitable for extended field measurements due to its chemical reactivity, 

and the previous Gerdien design was also difficult to clean. Preliminary investigations 

of  leakage  currents  and  their  characteristics  showed  that  their  magnitudes  and 

temperature dependencies were clearly significant, but could not be tested at the same 

time  as  the  ion  measurements.  A  further  difficulty,  relevant  to  Gerdien  condenser 

measurements  in  general,  is  that  the  instrument  lacks  an  absolute  calibration 

technique. It is difficult to generate sources of ions with a well-defined spectrum and 

concentration;  for  the  concentration  to  be  known  accurately,  they  would  have  to  be 

confined  in  some  defined  volume,  which  by  definition  introduces  problems  of 

unknown losses to the walls.  

 

5.2  Objectives 

The  primary  objective  is  to  produce  a  flexible  instrument  that  can  measure 

atmospheric 

ions  reliably  and  consistently,  by  further  development  of 

the 

microcontrolled system described in Chapter 3. To meet the reliability criterion, there 

                                                                                                                                                                      
45 The nomenclature conventions adopted in the introduction to Chapter 3 are continued here. 

Chapter 5

needs to be some way to assess the quality of the data. Direct calibration of a Gerdien-

type instrument is impractical with air ions for the reasons outlined in Section 5.1.1 

above,  therefore  the only means of (cid:147)quality assurance(cid:148) is to include some degree of 

self-calibration.  This  is  possible  with  a  Gerdien  condenser  by  comparing  ion 

measurements  made  in  the  voltage  decay  and  current  measurement  modes.  Further 

tests of the reliability of the data can be made by quantifying, and compensating for, 

as many leakage terms as it is possible to determine. Several PIMS instruments will 

be made to further improve the accuracy of the measurements. 

A  secondary  objective  of  developing  the  programmable  ion  mobility  spectrometer 

(PIMS) is to make an instrument that is well-suited to making measurements of ionic 

mobility spectra. 

5.2.1  New features of the system 
The  new  system  is  fully  automated,  and  controlled  by  the  original  16C56 

microcontroller, with more features added in software and hardware. It measures ions 

both by either the Voltage Decay or Current Measurement techniques, allowing self-

consistency  checks.  A  programmable  range  of  bipolar  bias  voltages  for  spectral 

measurements is attained by adding a digital bias voltage generator based on a DAC. 

A  current  amplifier  is  required  in  the  Current  Measurement  mode,  as  before. 

However,  voltage  decay  measurements  require  incorporation  of  a  unity  gain 

electrometer  follower  into  the  signal  processing  system.  Separate  op-amps  could  be 

used  to  measure  voltage  and  current,  with  the  inputs  switched  by  reed  relays 

controlled  by  the  microcontroller.  However,  this  configuration  would  further 

complicate assessing the errors due to leakage currents, which vary with the op-amp. 

A  new  electrometer  was  therefore  developed  which  uses  Reed  Relays  to  switch 

between the voltage follower and picoammeter modes. 

A new tube design with a stainless steel outer electrode was intended to improve the 

reliability  of  outdoor  measurements.  The  dimensions  of  the  tube  were  chosen 
specifically  to  measure  small  to  intermediate  ions  with  ¬µ > 0.2 cm2V-1s-1  (at  an 
average  flow  rate  of  2 ms-1),  given  the  practical  limitations  on  bias  voltage  supply.

This corresponds to a maximum particle radius of ~ 3 nm (Tammet, 1995), which is 

approximately  equivalent  to  the  lower  limit  of  presently-available  neutral  particle 

detectors such as the Pollak counter (Metnieks and Pollak, 1969).

Both electrodes of the new Gerdien device (5, 6) were constructed of stainless steel, 

and the tube was constructed so that it could be completely dismantled for cleaning or 

repair.  These  design  decisions  were  based  on  the  problems  encountered  with  an 

aluminium tube with the components sealed in, discussed in Chapter 3. Approximate 

dimensions are: central electrode length 25 cm, tube radius 11 mm, central electrode 

radius 2 mm. The outer screen was constructed of acrylic (3) wrapped in a sleeve of 

conducting  tape  (4)  to  provide  the  necessary  electrical  screening.  At  the  ends of the 

Perspex  sleeve  were  Teflon  insulating  supports  (3,  10),  into  which  the  fan  (1)  was 

housed at one end (2) (a small hole was drilled in the Perspex casing to thread the fan 

power  cables  through).  The  outer  screen  was  longer  than  the  central  and  outer 

electrodes,  so  a  further  insulating  support  (9)  was  required  to  support  the  outer 

electrode. At the other end of the tube, the bullet-insulator arrangement (11, 12) was 

similar  to  that  discussed  in  Section  3.1.1,  except  that  the  ends  of  the  cross-supports 

were wedged into the Teflon sleeve (10), rather than into the earthed screen to provide 

better electrical insulation.  

 

The  central  electrode  (6)  was  again  connected  directly  to  the  centre  of  the  BNC 

electrometer  connection.  However,  this  was  effected  by  attaching  another  piece  of 

wire  perpendicular  to  it  with  a  small  screw  (7),  rather  than  bending  the  central 

electrode  at  right  angles.  This  was  so  that  the  connection  could  be  taken  apart  for 

cleaning or repair. The connections to both electrodes (7,8) were carefully positioned 

so  that  the  whole  system  could  be  placed  in  a  box  for  field  measurements,  with  its 

apertures exposed to the air, but the electrical connections environmentally-protected 
inside.46

5.3 

 Programmable bias voltage circuitry 

Bias  voltages  for  the  Gerdien‚Äôs  outer  electrode  are  generated  with  an  8-bit digital to 

analogue  converter 

(DAC),  programmable  with  digital  signals 

from 

the 

microcontroller.  Since  the  full-scale  output  of  the  DAC  is  limited  by  its  external 

voltage reference Vref, which in this case is well-regulated by its 5 V power supply, an 

additional high voltage op-amp (IC3 in Figure 5.3) and power supply are required to 

provide the larger bias voltages necessary for the Gerdien. Power supplies limited the 
bias  voltage  range  to  ¬± 30 V.  However,  since  high-voltage  op-amps  and  power 

supplies capable of supplying up to 450 V or greater are available (Horowitz and Hill, 

1994;  Harrison,  1997b),  the  bias  voltages  could  in  principle  be  at  least  an  order  of 
magnitude greater, enabling measurements of ions with ¬µ > 0.01 cm2V-1s-1

, or up to a 

radius of about 16 nm.

5.4.1  Description 
The multimode electrometer (MME) (Harrison and Aplin, 2000c), shown in summary 

schematic  form  in  Figure  5.6  uses  five  reed  relays  and  logic  circuitry  to  switch 

between  the  modes  of  voltage  follower,  picoammeter,  Vos  check,  input  bias  current 

and  electrometer  leakage  measurement,  and  charging  the  central  electrode.  An 

overview of the functionality will be given here, and a complete specification is given

It is possible to measure the electrometer leakage current (which includes the effect of 

the input bias current) and input offset voltage by grounding the non-inverting input, 

as  shown  in  Figure  5.5.  In  the  new  multimode  electrometer,  reed  relays  are  used  to 

measure these quantities.

amplifier  configurations  by  reed  relay  switches  RL1  to  RL5  with  an  inverting  gain 
stage  of  IC1b  added.  Rf  is  1012‚Ñ¶.  MOSFET  change-over  switches  IC2  (4053),  are 

used to guard disconnected reed switch inputs, to minimise leakage. (Square pads on 

the schematic are used to denote the MOSFET ‚Äôoff‚Äô position and TP is a test point.) 

From Harrison and Aplin (2000c). 

Three  input  control  lines  are  decoded  by  logic  circuitry  to  drive  MOSFET  switches 

and, where high impedance switches are required, reed relay coils labelled RL1-5 in 

Figure  5.6.  The  reed  relay  drivers  are  also  connected  to  LEDs  so  it  is  possible  to 

identify  the  operating  mode  visually.  Switching  on  RL4  connects  the  signal  to  the 

non-inverting  input  of  the  first  op-amp,  and  puts  the  electrometer  into  the  voltage 

follower mode. In this mode, the outer screen needs guarding at the input to prevent 

leakage.  This  is  driven  by  MOSFET  switch  S2  in  the  off  position  and  S1  in  the  on 

position, which keeps the outer screen at the same potential as the output of IC1a. An 

additional leakage-reduction feature uses the guard connection to decrease leakage at 

the floating side of the open reed relays, controlled by MOSFET switches S1 and S2. 

RL5  charges  the  central  electrode  to  2.0 V,  via  the  input  connection,  before  voltage 

decay  measurements  can  be  made.  In  all  the  other  measurement  modes,  RL5  is 

Chapter 5 

125

The Programmable Ion Mobility Spectrometer 
 

necessarily off, and its open terminal is guarded at the output potential by S1 in the 

off  position.  RL3  shorts  out  the  feedback  resistor  Rf  in  the  follower  and  Vos  check 

modes.  

 

 

A further inverting, nominally x 33 gain stage, IC1b, is employed to amplify the small 

signal in the Vos and (Vos + ibRf) check modes, which is activated by S3. The gain of 

this stage is (cid:150)1 in the measurement mode, as the combination of a high value feedback 

resistor  and  unity  gain  stage  has  been  shown  in  Section  3.1.3  to  have  the  optimal 

thermal  stability  in  the  picoammeter  mode.  Therefore,  S3  in  the  off  (measuring) 
position connects a 10 k‚Ñ¶ resistor across IC1b, matching the resistance at the output 

of IC1a so there is approximately unit gain with sign inversion. 

A  fifth  mode  charges  up  the  central  electrode  to  2.0 V  when  RL5  is  closed,  with  a 

2.5 V  REF25Z  voltage  reference  (IC7)  and  a  potential  divider.  Used  in  conjunction 

with the bias voltage generated on the outer electrode, this can charge the electrodes 

to an effective potential difference of ~ 2.5 ‚Äì 30 V for voltage decay measurements.

Mode 1: Follower 

The follower mode was calibrated by applying a voltage (‚Äì 0.05 %) from a millivolt 

calibrator  at  the  input,  and  measuring  the  voltage  at  the  electrometer  output.  In  this 

mode, the first op-amp operates with unity gain, and the inverting second stage has a 

gain close to -1. The net effect is therefore a system gain of approximately (cid:150)1, which 

can be derived from Figure 5.8.

Mode 2: Current Amplifier 

The  picoammeter  mode  was  initially  calibrated  as  described  in  Section  3.2.3,  by 

generating a known current using a millivolt calibrator and a resistor, Rcal, which must 

also  be  calibrated.  As  in  Eq.  3.8,  in  an  i-to-V  converter  system  when  there  is  a 

secondary  stage  of  gain  G,  the  response  includes  the  input  offset  voltage  Vos 

multiplied  by  G.  So  there  is  a  compromise  between  using  a  large  magnitude 

calibration resistor which is difficult to measure directly, or a smaller resistor which 

introduces large offsets due to magnification of Vos. In this case both approaches were 

tried, and are described in Section 5.5. 

5.4.3  Voltage follower mode 
In the voltage decay mode, the charging potential was applied directly to the central 

electrode  via  the  MME  input  connection.  This  was  the  simplest  approach,  since  the 

switching could then be controlled directly by the MME. Applying a potential to the 

outer  electrode  would  require  modifications  to  both  the  DAC  and  microcontroller 

Chapter 5 

128

The Programmable Ion Mobility Spectrometer 
 

circuitry,  and  would  also  be  more  prone  to  leakage  (the  Gerdien  condenser  central 

electrode is designed to have ultra-low leakage).  

Although  the  total  voltage  across  the  tube  is  the  sum  of  the  bias  voltage  and  the 

central electrode voltage, the follower only measures the voltage between the central 

electrode  and  ground  in  a  maximum  range  of  2.5 V.  It  is  possible  to  measure  the 

voltage decay at either electrode because it occurs at an equal rate from both of them. 

The charging potential Vf was set at + 2 V so that the voltage decay of charge was in 

the optimal range to be measured. This was achieved by using a 2.5 V reference with 

a potential divider. A positive electrode charging voltage was chosen because the op-

amp(cid:146)s input bias current is much greater for negative input voltages, therefore forcing 

the input voltage to be positive optimises the measurement. 

Measurements  in  the  voltage  decay  mode  are  unipolar,  resulting  from  the  voltage 

follower(cid:146)s  limiting  measurement  range  of  2.5 V  to  ground.  If  Vb = +30 V  and 

Vf = +2 V,  then  the  exchange  of  charge  due  to  air  ions  will  not  cause  the voltage to 

decay,  but  will  increase  it  towards  30 V,  a  change  which  cannot  be  detected  by  the 

follower.  However  if  Vb = -30 V,  adding  Vf = +2 V  takes  the  voltage  across  the 

electrodes  to  above  the  system  ground,  which  it  will  decay  from  to  0 V.  Therefore 

with  a  positive  central  electrode  voltage,  only  negative  ions  can  be  measured. 

Electrometer  leakage  currents  are  not  a  function  of  the  bias  voltage,  therefore  it  is 

preferable  to  have  the  highest  potential  difference  possible  across  the  electrodes,  in 

order to maximise the signal-current to leakage-current ratio.

The exact value of a 1G‚Ñ¶ resistor constructed from 10 x (100 ‚Äì 5 %) M‚Ñ¶ resistors in

The response of the MME picoammeter mode to currents generated with a millivolt 
calibrator, and the (1.00053 ‚Äì 0.00001) G‚Ñ¶ resistor, is shown in Figure 5.10.

offset  of  Eq.  5.5,  if  one  of  the  resistance  values  in  Eq.  5.5  is  well-known,  then  the 

gradient of Eq. 5.5 can be used to find the other resistance. This method was applied 
to measure the 1T‚Ñ¶ ‚Äì 20 % resistor, by using it as the current-generating resistor Rcal 
with  the  Œó92  picoammeter  which  has  Rf = 4 G‚Ñ¶ .  The  value  of  the  resistor  was 
deduced to be (0.7720 ‚Äì 0.0004) T‚Ñ¶.

resistors  of  772  G‚Ñ¶  and  1  G‚Ñ¶. The  error  bars  on  the  abscissa  result  from  the 

uncertainty in the magnitude of the calibration resistor. 

 
In Figure 5.10 some inconsistencies can be seen between the two calibration methods. 
Calibration  with  Rcal = 1.00053 G‚Ñ¶ has  a  significant  offset  of  -750 mV,  in  contrast 
with  Rcal = 772 G‚Ñ¶ when

when the same instrument, which had not been used in the meantime, was recalibrated 

9 days later. In Appendix B the system response is derived, and the analysis suggests 

that significant offsets can result from amplification of the input offset voltage when 

Rf >>  Rcal.  This  hypothesis  was  tested  by  estimating  the  magnified  offset.  Vos  was 

measured with the MME in mode 3 (Table A.1), and found to be   ~ 1 mV. It is clear 

that  since  Vos ~ 1 mV,  this  multiplied  by  a  gain  equivalent  to  Rf /Rcal.  accounts  for 

almost all of the offset in the calibration. It can be concluded that it is unsatisfactory 
to use 1 G‚Ñ¶ calibration resistors in conjunction with much larger feedback resistors, 

because the multiplied input voltage offset changes with temperature, and over time, 

are sufficient to degrade the calibration. This is explicitly given in the overall system 

response, which is shown in Appendix B as:

Eq. 5.6 

The term showing the sum of input, bias ib and leakage currents iL in Eq. 5.6 explains 
the unsatisfactory temporal variation of the gain when the 772 G‚Ñ¶ calibration resistor 

was  used.  As  explained  in  Appendix  B,  both  the  gain  and  intercept  of  the  Vout-i 

calibration  graph  will  only  remain  constant  if  the  input  bias  current,  electrometer 

leakage  currents  and  input  offset  voltage  are  invariant,  which  is  unlikely.  In 

conclusion, the method described of resistive calibration described above is inherently 

unsuitable for picoammeter calibration, because of amplification of the offset voltage 

and changes in leakage currents. 

 

 

5.5.2  A capacitative calibration technique: the femtoampere current reference  
In  response  to  the  problems  with  resistive  calibration  explained  in  Section  5.5.1,  a 

different calibration technique was developed based on a capacitative principle, which 
ensures  Rcal  is  large  (Harrison  and  Aplin,  2000a)48.  It  generates  a  slowly  varying 
voltage  ramp  (¬± 52.5 mVs-1,  over  32 s)  using  a  crystal  oscillator.  If  this  signal  is 

presented  to  a  10 pF  polystyrene  capacitor,  it  produces  a  bipolar  current  of  order 
¬± 500 fA, with its sign depending whether the voltage ramp is on the rising or falling 

edge.  For  the  calibrator  used  in  this  Thesis,  the  current  was  measured  with  the 
Keithley  6512  electrometer  to  be ¬± 470 ¬± 2 fA  over  the  temperature  range  -22  to 

21.7 ‚ÄùC, and was also temporally stable. The femtoampere current reference was used 

to calibrate the MME picoammeter mode, which is shown in Figure 5.11. 

                                                           
48 The principles of the capacitative calibrator (Harrison and Aplin, 2000a), are described in Appendix 
B.

precision  voltage  ramp  connected  to  a  10 pF  capacitor.  The  offset  was  measured 

when the picoammeter input was connected to the screened 10 pF capacitor, with the 
ramp generator disconnected. The picoammeter gain is (1.104 ¬± 0.004) V/pA, and the 

offset is (2.3¬± 0.1) mV (errors are the standard error in the least squares linear fit). 

 
5.6  Testing of MME measurement modes 

5.6.1  Error term modes 
The input offset voltage was measured at the Reading University Meteorology Field 

Site  on  eight  days.  Vos  was  observed  to  vary  slowly  with  time,  so  the  averages  for 

each  day  of  measurements  were  calculated  and  compared  against  the  average 

temperature over the same period in Figure 5.12.

Figure  5.12  Variation  of  mean  input  offset  voltage  of  the  MME  with  mean 

temperature, over eight diurnal cycles. 

 
Figure 5.12 shows that Vos varies linearly with temperature at a rate of 9.3 ¬µV‚ÄùC-1, and 
Vos typically varies in the range 1-10 ¬µV‚ÄùC-1, (Peyton and Walsh, 1993) with 10 ¬µV‚ÄùC-
1 quoted by the manufacturers as typical for the LMC 6042 op-amp used in the MME. 

The  errors  introduced  due  to  this  source  are  negligible  relative  to  the  ion  current, 

because  after  calibration  the  effect  of  Vos  included  in  the  picoammeter  mode  output 

voltage only represents currents of order atoamperes.  

 

The leakage term iL, found directly using electrometer modes 3 and 4, is composed of 

the input bias current plus some leakage currents within the MME. The likely origin 

of  the  measured  leakage  currents  can  be  assessed  from  considering  which  relays 

contribute to the leakage in each mode. In mode 4 (leakage current test), RL1, RL3, 

RL4  and  RL5  are  open.  RL5  is  guarded,  and  RL4  has  no  current  path,  so  their 

contributions  can  be  neglected  and  the  leakage  must  be  from  RL1,  RL3  or  leakage 

across  the  screen  to  the  input.  In  mode  3  (current  measurement)  a  similar  argument 

suggests that the leakage current is primarily from RL3 or the screen. This shows that 

the  leakage  currents  in  each  mode  are  slightly  different,  because  the  nature  of  any 

self-monitoring instrument necessarily requires its configuration to change to measure

signal and leakage. Though it appears valid to compensate for some of the errors by 

this method of switching between modes, it is ultimately unable to completely correct 

for all electrometer leakages. However, the results of laboratory tests shown in Figure 

5.13 imply substantial compensation for the leakage current measured in MME mode 

2  is  relevant,  since  iL  was  strongly  temperature  dependent,  with  a  variation  of    -
9 fŒë‚ÄùC-1. At a bias voltage of 20 V, this would contribute an error of 0.4 fSm-1‚ÄùC-1 to 

the conductivity measurement, which is a significant drift.

5.6.2  Compensating for leakage currents in the ion current measurement 
To  justify  compensating  the  ion  current  measurements  for  the  leakages  measured  in 

mode 2, it must be shown that the leakage currents are small with respect to the ion 

currents, and that they vary more slowly than they are sampled. The time series of i/iL, 

which shows the relative magnitudes of leakage and signal, was constant with a well-

defined mean up to timescales of about two hours, but there was a slow drift, due to 

the  temperature  dependence  of  iL.  Over  a  whole  day,  a  linear  fit  of  i  against  iL  had 
R2 = 0.41. This suggests that neither i nor iL is fluctuating fast enough to reduce the 

effectiveness  of  the  compensation  procedure.  Short-term  fluctuations  in  iL  may 

Chapter 5 

135

The Programmable Ion Mobility Spectrometer 
 

introduce some uncertainty into the current measurement, because they are both 10 s 

(1 Hz) averages made with a 5 s pause between them. If iL is fluctuating rapidly, then 

subtracting its average value may not be an adequate compensation. iL was measured 

in  the  laboratory  at  1Hz  for  half  an  hour  and  the  mean  30 s  standard  deviation  was 

calculated, which is the same time-scale as the compensation. It was 0.5 %, which is 

comparable to the error in the electrometer calibration.

resistively generated current of ‚àº 600 fA. iL is shown in the blue (dotted) trace on the 

right-hand axis. 

 
Figure  5.14  shows  that  the  leakage  current  is  at  most  8 %  of  the  total  signal,  and 

subtracting  it  from  the  measured  current  brings  the  mean  closer  to  the  reference 
signal. Here, the reference signal was generated using a 1 T‚Ñ¶ resistor, and is therefore 

also  subject  to  temperature  fluctuations,  but  since  identical  calibration  and feedback 

resistors were used for all the current measurements, they could be expected to track 

together  in  the  same  thermal  environment.  (An  absolute  calibration  technique  has 

been  described  in  Section  5.5.2).  The  electrometer  leakage  current  can  be  seen  as  a 

source  of  slowly  varying  offset,  shifting  the  average  value  of  the  signal.  When  it  is 

compensated for, the average moves but the short-term fluctuations in the signal are

diminished. In further data analysis, the iL contribution has been subtracted from the 

ion current measurements, as a correction to the mean. 

5.6.3  Switching transients 
In Section 3.1.4 it was shown that one reed relay injects typically 6 fC of charge into 

the system when closed. It is necessary to allow some time for the system to recover 

from  each  transient,  so  that  it  does  not  affect  the  measurements.  However,  the 

comparisons  between  measurements  made  in  different  MME  modes,  such  as  the 

subtraction  of  Vos  measured  in  mode  3  from  the  results  in  mode  4  to  calculate 

electrometer  leakage  currents,  necessitate  making  the  measurements  as  immediately 

consecutive  as  possible.  The  optimal  recovery  time  is  the  time  it  takes  for  the 

exponential decay from the transient to become indistinguishable from the real signal. 

An  empirical  investigation  to  find  the  optimal  recovery  time  was  carried  out,  by 

making  measurements  with  the  tube  sealed  but  with  the  voltage  switching  on,  and 

varying  the time before starting to measure after the voltage was changed. This was 

determined  by  using  the  microcontrolled  system  to  start  logging  with  2 Hz  samples 

immediately after the voltage was switched, and also with a pause before the start of 

logging.  The  time  series  were  then  examined  to  see  if  the  samples  showed  decay 

characteristics,  by  fitting  a  straight  line  to  each set of voltage and time samples and 

calculating  the  gradient.  If  the  mean  gradient  of  all  the  voltage  time  series  was 

negative,  this  was  used  as  an  indicator  that  the  decay  from  the  transient  was 

continuing to dominate the signal. Recovery times from 0-30 s were tested, and 10 s 

was  the  shortest  settling  time  after  which  the  decay  from  the  transient  had  finished. 

Hence,  10 s  was  the  recovery  time  chosen  for  use  in  the  control  program  between 

mode changes.  

5.6.4  Electrometer control software 
Dedicated microcontroller programs were developed for controlling and testing each 

electrometer  mode  separately.  Source  code  is  given  in  Appendix  C,  and  Table  5.1 

below summarises the function of each program.

5.7  Integrated PIMS system 

This  section  describes  the  integration  of  the  separate  components  into  a  complete 

PIMS  system.  The  capacitance  of  the  Gerdien  condenser  is  determined  using  the 

femtoampere reference (Harrison and Aplin, 2000a), and the overall control program 

is  described.  Three  of  these  PIMS  systems  were  constructed,  and  some  results  from 

them will be compared in Section 5.7.4. 

5.7.1  Measurement of capacitance of Gerdien condenser 
Since the femtoampere reference (Harrison and Aplin, 2000a) generates a current by 

passing  a  voltage  ramp  through  a  capacitor,  using  precision  components,  it  is  clear 

that,  alternatively,  if  the  current  from  a  capacitor  connected  to  the  voltage  ramp  is 

measured accurately, its capacitance can be determined. This technique was employed 

to calculate the capacitance of the Gerdien condenser, which has classically not been 

known  accurately,  as  explained  in  Chapter  2.  In  the  miniature  Gerdien  condenser 

there is also a finite capacitance CS between the outer electrode and screen. This is in 

addition  to  the  (cid:147)exposed  capacitance(cid:148)  (Arathoon,  1991),  which  is  the  effective 

capacitance  of  the  Gerdien  exposed  to  ions,  and  is  required  for  conductivity 

calculation  from  Current  Mode  results  (Eq.  2.17).  Here  the  exposed  capacitance  is 

referred to as CG, between the outer and central electrodes, which determines the ionic 

charge stored on the electrodes. These capacitances, which are unavoidably present in 

series, are schematically represented in Figure 5.15.

Figure 5.15 Schematic of the capacitances between the Gerdien condenser electrodes 

The  capacitance  CS  is  clearly  not  associated  with  ion  measurements  made  with  the 

Gerdien  condenser,  since  they  only  involve  a  flow  of  charge  to  or  from  the  central 

electrode.  It  must  therefore  be  discounted  in  any  measurement  of  capacitance.  This 

was achieved by shorting the outer electrode to the screen, as shown below in Figure 

5.16, so CS cannot contribute to the current measured.

Chapter 5 

139

The Programmable Ion Mobility Spectrometer 
 

CG = 9.07 pF, and the standard error of the current above is 0.3 %. Stray capacitance, 

for  example  from  the  connections  probably  dominates  the  errors  in  the  capacitance 

determination;  therefore  the  error  in  the  Gerdien  condenser  capacitance  is  estimated 

as  1 %, 0.09 pF  for  this  Gerdien.  This  approach  has  reduced  the  uncertainty  in  the 

current method of conductivity measurement due to the capacitance term by an order 

of  magnitude,  compared  to  other  capacitance  determination  methods, e.g. Aplin and 

Harrison (1999), Smith (1953). 

5.7.2  Complete control program 
The  individual  control  programs  for  calibration  of  individual  components  described 

above  (Section  5.6.4)  were  merged  with  the  ADC  control  program  described  in 

Chapter  4  to  control  the  whole  system.  As  a  variety  of  measurements  were  being 

made,  a  more  sophisticated  logging  strategy  was  needed.  The  sampling  rate  is  a 

compromise  between  taking  enough  samples  to  average  and  smooth  high-frequency 

fluctuations,  and  rapid  sampling  to  improve  the  voltage  decay  and  current 

measurement intercomparisons. In the voltage decay mode, the ion current flowing is 

inferred from the rate of change of potential. Hence, time averaging is not relevant in 

this  case,  and  the  samples  should  be  temporally  close  to  maintain  consistency  of 

atmospheric  conditions  during  the  sampling  period.  Therefore,  ten  measurements  of 

the voltage across the tube were made at 2 Hz. 

The sampling characteristics for the other three MME modes were chosen to minimise 

the standard deviation of the raw measurements, before averaging. This was tested by 

calculating  the  variability  of  measurements  at  different  frequencies,  and  for  varying 

periods,  from  a  sealed  Gerdien  in  the  laboratory  at  zero  bias  voltage.  Under  these 

conditions, the only variability in the ion concentration should result from background 

ionisation,  therefore  the  measurements  made  can  be  considered  equivalent  to  a 

background noise level. The minimum variability in the background noise level was 

found when ten measurements were made at 2 Hz, and these settings were empirically 

selected for application in the final control program.

The  final  control  program  was  called  MMESYS*49,  where  *  represents  the  PIMS 
number it was written for50. Calibrations of the components differed slightly, and in 

order  to  ensure  the  same  ionic  mobilities  were  measured  from  instrument  to 

instrument, slightly different variables (and timings, discussed in Section 5.7.3) in the 

programs  were  required.  As  well  as  controlling  the  different  mode  switching, 

MMESYS averages (except in the follower mode) and logs data and sends it serially 

to the PC. This format was chosen to ease the compensation procedure and separation 

of  results  from  the  Current  Measurement  and  Voltage  Decay  modes,  when  the  text 

files are subsequently calibrated using MS Excel. A sample set of lines from the PC 

data file is shown below, and is explained in Table 5.2.

programming  loops  including  this  command.  Since  the  PIMS  control  programs 

typically  include  several  such  loops,  errors  are  expected  in  the  timing,  which  were 

observed when using the microcontrolled picoammeter with the voltage ramp derived 

current  source.  This  has  a  precisely-timed  ramp  time  of  32 s  (Harrison  and  Aplin, 

2000a), and when trying to make the microcontroller program match this cycle, there 

was a 15 % error. Processing the voltage decay data involves least squares fitting to

voltage as a function of time, and therefore the internal timing of these measurements 

does  need  to  be  known  accurately.  The  voltage  decay  sampling  frequency  was 

nominally 2 Hz, but was measured to be a constant 1.98 Hz with a digital stop clock, 

on  which  the  timings  for  data  processing  were  based.  (The  error  in  the 

microcontroller(cid:146)s  internal  clock  was  insignificant  on  the  5 s  timescale).  The 

inconsistency between different devices was also investigated. 

Three  PIMS  systems  were  constructed,  and 

inconsistencies  between 

the 

microcontrollers(cid:146)  internal  clocks  meant  that  the  measurements  were  asynchronous, 

even when the same program was running on them all. Test programs indicated that 

the  internal  timers  were  tuned  slightly  differently,  so  that  the  PAUSE  command 

produced  a  pause  of  a  length  which  was  a  constant  factor  different  from  the  same 

command  executed  on  a  different  microcontroller.  The  recovery  time  between 

switching  the  bias  voltage  was  therefore  lengthened  slightly  by  an  empirically 

determined  factor 

in 

the  PAUSE  statement 

in  MMESYS*,  so 

that  all 

the 

microcontrollers  had 

the  same  program 

time  period.  Operating 

the 

three 

microcontrollers  from  one  switchable  power  supply  allowed  all  the  programs  to  be 

started simultaneously. 

 

 

5.7.4  Testing the integrated PIMS systems 
An important test of the integrated Gerdien system is to compare results from the two 

ion  measurement  modes  of  the  MME.  The complete system was run at the Reading 
Meteorology  Field  Site  on  22nd  March  2000.  For  running  in  atmospheric  air,  the 

PIMSs were housed in watertight plastic boxes (28 x 18 x 8 cm), as shown in Figure 

5.17.  The  Gerdien  inlets  protruded,  and  the  microcontroller/ADC,  MME  and 

DAC/power supply circuitry were in three small metal boxes, wired inside the plastic 

box. There were two Buccaneer connectors on the plastic box, one two-way for power 

from  a  12 V  lead-acid  battery,  and  one  six-way  carrying  serial  and  parallel 

connections to a laptop PC for logging and programming respectively.

Figure  5.18  Comparison  of  negative  conductivity  calculated  with  results  from  both 

methods, and with PIMS 2 and 3 at Reading on 22nd March 2000. 

There is a general agreement between the conductivity calculated by the two methods, 

although  the  absolute  magnitudes  do  vary.  PIMS  2  shows  comparable  mean  values. 

Further  analysis  is  required  to  explain  the  disparities  in  the  measurements,  but  it  is 

clear  that  the  different  instruments  and  techniques  show  comparable  behaviour.  All 

the  major  peaks  are  detected  by  both  measurement  modes,  and  the  mean  value  is 
about  12 fSm-1,  which  conforms  to  typical  fair  weather  measurements  in  urban 

locations (e.g. Chalmers, 1967; previous measurements are discussed in Chapter 2). 

5.8  Conclusions 

A  programmable  ion  mobility  spectrometer  has  been  designed  and  tested  in  this 

chapter,  incorporating  a  new  multimode  electrometer  and  improved  Gerdien  design. 

The  errors  in  previous  conductivity  measurements  will  have  been  significantly 

reduced  by  determination  of  the  Gerdien  capacitance  to  1 %,  and  compensation  for 

temperature-dependent  voltage  offsets  and  some  leakages.  A  further  innovative 

feature  is  the  ability  to  check  self-consistency  from  both  current  and  voltage

6  PIMS atmospheric calibration and testing 

 
 
In this chapter, the testing of the PIMS instrument in the atmosphere is described in 

detail.  The  deployment  of  three  individual  PIMS,  each  with  two  ion  measurement 

modes, facilitates self-calibration, and these results are discussed in sections 6.4 and 

6.5.  The  PIMS  results  are  also  compared  to  measurements  from  two  independent 

external instruments, a Geiger counter, which responds to ionising radiation, (Section 

6.3)  and  another  Gerdien  ion  counter  of  more  classical  design  (section  6.6.1).  This 

chapter  also  necessarily  contains,  as  a  precursor  to  the  results,  details  of  the 

experimental  configuration  and  data  processing,  which  are  outlined  in  Sections  6.1 

and 6.2. 

 

The structure of the calibration and comparison procedures is explained graphically in 

Figure  6.1.  Three  PIMS  instruments  were  constructed,  and  the  simplest  test  is  of 

internal  consistency  between  the  two  modes  on  each  instrument.  The  results  from 

each  mode  can  then  be  compared  to  other  PIMS  measurements.  The  most  rigorous 

calibration procedure is to compare the PIMS results to other instruments measuring 

ions, a Geiger counter and a Gerdien condenser.

6.1  Description of PIMS atmospheric deployment 

Measurements  were  made  at  Reading  University  Meteorology  Field  Site  with  the 

three  PIMS instruments mounted next to each other, with the inlets facing south, on a 

mast at 1.25 m. A photograph of the mast is shown in Figure 6.2. This was the same 

height  the  Geiger  counter  had  been  at  for  previous  long-term  monitoring  of  local 

radioactivity at the Field Site. For effective comparison with the Geiger count rate, the 

PIMS  needed  to  be mounted at the same height. The orientation was chosen so that 

the average wind velocity would be as close as possible to the wind tunnel test speed 
of 2 ms-1, for which the bias voltage range was selected. (Mean wind speed at the site 
for  1999  was  2.2 ms-1,  and  direction  197‚Äù,  so  the  southerly  component  is  2.1  ms-1, 

which matches the fan(cid:146)s ventilation rate almost exactly). The inlets were arranged as 

close as possible, but the plastic PIMS housing kept the minimum separation to about 

15 cm; this can be seen in Figure 6.3.

6.2  Calibration of raw data  

Data is stored in a text file by the logging PC as integer values (ADC counts) from 0 

to  4095,  representing  an  output  range  of  ‚Äì 2.5 V.  Voltage  calibration  of  the  ADC 

converter  was  described  in  section  4.2.1;  further  calibration  is  then  required, 

depending on the MME mode, to convert the voltage into the correct magnitude of ion 

current  or  electrode  voltage.  The  details  of  this  procedure  for  the  two  ion 

measurement  modes,  and  the  calculations  performed  to  obtain  conductivity  values 

from the measurements, are described below. 

6.2.1  Current Measurement method 
In this mode the measured current imeas is calculated by calibrating the ADC output, as 

shown  in  the  schematic  diagram  (Figure  6.4).  A  voltage  offset  of  2.5 V  has  to  be 

added  to  the  bipolar  current  measurement  because  the  ADC  is  only  unipolar,  (see 

section 4.2.1), therefore 2.5 V must be subtracted from the voltage obtained from the 

ADC  counts  before  the  MME  picoammeter  calibration  can  be  applied.  The 

electrometer  leakage  current  iL  is  calculated  separately  from  the  results  of  the  two

the process through to the corrected current used to calculate conductivity ic.

6.2.2  Voltage Decay method 
In this mode, repeated electrode voltage measurements are required. Figure 6.5 below 

outlines the procedure used to calculate the voltage between the Gerdien condenser(cid:146)s 

central  and  outer  electrodes.  Since  there  is  a  bias  on  both  electrodes,  the  potential 

difference the ions are subject to in the Gerdien is determined by the sum of the bias 

voltage  Vb  (potential  difference  between  outer  electrode  and  ground)  and  Vf,  the 

voltage  measured  by  the  MME  at  the  central  electrode  with  respect  to  ground.  This 

will be referred to here as Vdecay,, where Vf is a function of time.

Eq. 6.3. 

Eq. 6.4, 

Eq. 6.5, 

it is clear that the gradient of a graph of ln Vdecay against time is equivalent to -œÉ/Œµ0. 

This approach was applied to calculate conductivity from the time series of Vdecay. The 

time of each voltage reading with respect to the start of the measurement (when the 

reed  relay  which  activates  the  charging  of  the  central  electrode  is  switched  off)  is 

approximately determined using the microcontroller program, and was also calibrated 

using  a  digital  stopwatch  (see  section  5.7.3).  Since  only  negative  ions  can  be 

measured at the central electrode during the active decay from (cid:150)32.5 V to (cid:150)30V (see 

section 5.4.3), all results here refer to negative ion measurements. An MS Excel least 

squares  linear  fitting  worksheet  function,  LINEST,  was  then  applied  to  the  natural 

logarithm of the magnitude of each voltage reading, with time as the abscissa, starting 

from a first sample at t = 0.505 s.  

LINEST  was  also  used  to  calculate  the  standard  error  in  fitting  the  gradient  to  the 
points, which can be used to calculate an error in œÉ resulting directly from the least 
squares  regression  procedure.  The  coefficient  of  determination54  R2,  was  also 

determined using the same function. This is a (cid:147)goodness of fit(cid:148) parameter from 0 to 1. 
If R2 = 1, there is no difference between the y-values predicted by the theory and the 
actual y-value, and decreasing R2 indicates increasing inappropriateness of fitting the 

regression  equation  to  the  data  (Johnson  and  Bhattacharrya,  1996).  The  fitting 
procedure described above resulted in a mean R2 = 0.65, which was similar for all the 

data sets. To test whether this fraction of exponential decays could occur by chance, a 

Monte Carlo simulation was run to generate 1000 random voltage decay traces. This 

Chapter 6 

 

155 

PIMS atmospheric calibration and testing 

simulates  the  input  that  would  be  generated  by  noise.  The  same  exponential  curve 

fitting  procedure  was  applied  to  the  randomly generated decays. Only 0.15 % of the 
random decay data had R2 > 0.65, which strongly suggests that only a tiny fraction of 

the exponential decays seen here could occur by chance. 

 
For  exponential  fitting  to  voltage  decay  data,  the  coefficient  of  determination  is  a 

useful quantity, because, as suggested in Section 2.2.2, an exponential decay may not 

always  be  an  appropriate  method  to  calculate  conductivity.  The  critical  mobility 

(minimum mobility) of ions contributing to the measurement decreases as the voltage 

decays,  and  therefore  the  number  of  ions  actually being measured varies with decay 

voltage.  This  is  equivalent  to  the  charge  on  a  capacitor  decaying  across  a  variable 

resistor; thus the theory outlined in Section 2.2.2 leading to Eq. 6.4, may not apply in 

some  cases.  The  effectiveness  of  assuming  an  exponential  decay  depends  on  the 

characteristics  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrum,  which  provides  information  about  the 
number  of  ions  having  each  mobility55.  For  these  reasons,  the  standard  error  of  the 

exponential  fit  is  not  equivalent  to  the  error  in  the  measurement.  If  the  critical 

mobility  were  invariant  with  voltage,  there  should  always  be  an  ideal  exponential 

decay  and  in  this  limit,  the  standard  error  of  the  fit  would  be  the  true  error.  The 

standard  error  of  the  exponential  fit  may  therefore  be  considered  as  a  worst  case 

estimate of the measurement error. 

 

The  raw  data  does  not  always  follow  an  approximately  exponential  decay,  in  some 

cases  the  voltage  across  the  electrodes  increases,  and  over  the  5 s  of  sampling  the 

voltage  can  fluctuate  considerably.  A  sample  set  of  voltage  decay  time  series, 

measured  over  one  hour  from  12:25  to  13:25  on  27  June  2000  is  shown  below  in 

Figure  6.6.  The  decay  characteristics  show  substantial  variation  over  this  relatively 

short  time,  which  is  common  to  all  the  voltage  decay  measurements.  The  best  and 

worst  exponential  fit  lines  in  the  hour  of  measurements  are  also  shown,  and  span 
R2 = 0.88  to  0.19.  If  the  voltage  across  the  electrodes  increases  anomalously,  the

gradient will be a positive number and the calculated conductivity will be negative. It 

is consequently inferred that the electrodes are charging up, and the data is rejected. In 

Figure 6.6, some data sets show both decay and charging characteristics, for example 

at 12:41 there is an exponential decay for the first three seconds which then changes 

direction.  If  an  exponential  is  fitted  to  the  part  of  the  data  which  is  showing  decay 
characteristics, then it has an R2 value of 0.86, but a fit to the whole time series has 
R2 = 0.50.  This  will  also  affect  the  magnitude  of  the  calculated  conductivity,  which 

increases as the gradient of the exponential curve decreases.

PIMS atmospheric calibration and testing 

There  are  clearly  grounds  to  reject  the  data  where  the  voltage  increases  with  time 

rather  than  decaying,  on  the  basis  that  some  other  physical  process  rather  than 

unipolar  ionic  conduction  is  occurring.  There  are  several  possible  approaches  to 

filtering  the  data,  for  example  fitting  exponential  decays  to  all  sections  of  the  data 

where the voltage is decreasing with time, and discarding the rest. With this method, 

sometimes only very few points would be involved in the curve fit, and the number of 

points  would  vary.  The  method  of  calculation  of  conductivity  would  become  less 

rigorous  with  fewer  points  in  the  regression,  and  individual  values  would  be  of 

varying  reliability  due  to  the  changing  number  of  points  in  the  fit.  The  most 

conservative  filtering  method  would  be  only  to  accept  data  where  the  voltage 

decreases  throughout  the  complete  time  series  (i.e.  every  voltage  is  less  than  the 

previous one); however in a 12-hour sample of voltage decay data from 27 June 2000, 

this would reject 52 % of all the voltage decays. For these reasons, exponential fitting 

to the complete 5 s of data was instead chosen because it offers an average fit based 

on results from the whole sampling time. If the average effect is a charging process, 
i.e.<‚àÜV/‚àÜt>   > 0,  the  calculated  conductivity  will  be  negative,  and  the  data  is 

rejected.  In  the  selected  data  set,  only  1 %  of  the  voltage  decay  measurements  were 

rejected  using  this  criterion,  therefore  this  method  optimises  the  available  data  but 

rejects cases when the central electrode voltage at the end of the sample exceeds its 

starting value.  

 

 

6.3  Comparisons of PIMS data with ion production rate 

In Chapter 3, ion concentrations measured in clean air correlated with the square root 

of  the  count  rate  from  an  adjacent  Geiger  counter,  which  is  a  proxy  for  the  ion 

production rate q, depending on the aerosol concentration. This relationship is derived 

from ion-aerosol theory (e.g. Clement and Harrison, 1992), explained in Section 2.2.3. 
In clean air, the ion concentration n varies as q0.5, 

n =

q
Œ±

 

Eq. 6.6 

and  for  very  polluted  air  when  the  attachment  of  ions  to aerosol dominates, and the 

self-recombination term can be neglected so that n is directly proportional to q:

Eq. 6.7. 

Between  these  two  limits,  both  aerosol  attachment  and  ion  recombination  terms 

control ion concentrations. A plot of n against q should therefore fit a power law with 

exponent between 0.5 and 1. The ion concentration and Geiger count rate at Reading 
University  Meteorology  Field  Site  were  plotted  for  two  fair  weather  days,  25th 
February  2000  and 9th April 2000. This is an urban location, with local PM10 mass 
concentrations  of  19  and  18  ¬µgm-3  for  the  two  periods  respectively  (National  Air 
Quality Archive (NAQA), 200056). Since typical PM10 concentrations at Mace Head, 

where  the  clean  air  measurements  were  made  in  the  recombination  limit  are  about 
1 ¬µgm-3, the Reading is data not expected to be represented by Eq. 6.6. 

 

 

For both of the days studied, the relationship predicted by ion-aerosol theory did not 

hold,  with  the  ion  concentration  decreasing  slightly  as  the  local  radioactivity 
increased.  Fitting  a  power  law  to  the  data  did  not  appear  appropriate,  since  the  R2 

values were very poor (0.04 and 0.009 respectively). Since this effect was repeatable, 

and the two days showed similar ion-aerosol characteristics (shown in Table 6.1), this 

suggests  that  application  of  the  classical  theory  is  not  straightforward  for  urban  air, 

which was also found by Guo et al (1996).

Figure  6.7  A  four  minute  time  series  of  1 Hz  Geiger  counter  data  from  Reading 
University Meteorology Field Site on 8th April 2000, 1500-1504. 

 
The  great  variability  of  q  (an  order  of  magnitude  in  a  few  minutes  is  normal,  as  in 

Figure 6.7) perturbs the steady-state assumed by the ion balance equation. This makes 

it  more  difficult  to  use  ion-aerosol  theory  to  show  that  the  PIMS  is  actually 

responding to ion variations, but its response to large fluctuations in ionisation can be 

instead be used as a test. Long-term averages could also be used, but the Geiger count 

rate does not vary in a very wide range, and the ion concentration is also sensitive to 

other  factors  (e.g.  aerosol  concentration,  meteorological  effects),  so  it  would  be 

difficult to distinguish the effect of the ionisation rate alone from the other quantities 

influencing the ions. Figure 6.8 shows a comparison between the ionisation rate and 

the ion concentration for a time series of one hour. Negative ions were measured with 

the  PIMS,  at  a  bias  voltage  of  (cid:150)30 V,  and  the  ion  current  (which  is  directly 

proportional to the ion number concentration) is plotted with the count rate from an 

adjacent Geiger counter at the same height (1.25 m).

Figure  6.8  PIMS  3  response  to  ionisation  fluctuations.  This  is  part  of  a  time  series 
measured  at  Reading  on  8th  April  2000  from  1500-2100.  1600-1700  is  shown  here. 

The  thinner  dotted  trace  (RH  axis)  is  the  negative  ion  current,  sampled  every  157s 

and filtered according to the criteria discussed above. The thicker trace is a 157 point 

centred moving average of 1 Hz Geiger counter data. 

 
Some of the ion peaks, at about 1630, 1645 and 1700 occur at the same time as a peak 

in  the  Geiger  output,  which  suggests  that  the  PIMS  is  able  to  respond  to  ionisation 

fluctuations. The PIMS has now been demonstrated to respond to ionisation transients 

in  urban  air  on  the  timescale  of  minutes,  which  supports  the  clean  air  calibration 

described in Section 3.3.2. 

 

6.4  PIMS ion measurement mode intracomparisons 

The  two  PIMS  measurement  modes  were  compared  by  running  both  modes  on  one 

instrument  at  the  same  bias  voltage  in  fair  weather  conditions,  and  conductivity 

calculated from both methods as described in Section 6.1. The two modes frequently 

showed a good agreement, and an example is given below (Figure 6.9), in which the 

correlation coefficient of 15-minute averages of the data is 0.51.

Figure  6.9  Comparison  of  the  two  PIMS  measurement  modes  on  9th  April  2000  at 

Reading. Results are shown from the PIMS 2 instrument from 1400-1700.  

 
There  is  generally  a  correspondence  in  the  trends  of  the two traces,  e.g. from 1410-

1453,  1536-1648.  Although  there are some periods when the magnitudes of the two 

traces  agree  well,  e.g.  1424-1453,  1605-1634,  their  mean  values  are  significantly 
different. In Figure 6.9, the mean negative conductivity from the Current Method, œÉi, 
was  10 fSm-1,  but  from  the  Voltage  Decay  mode,  œÉv,  it  was  18 fSm-1.  Both  these 

values are acceptable (see review of previous measurements in Section 2.2.3), but the 

difference  between  them  implies  a  variable  offset  or  gain  in  one  or  both  of  the 

measurement modes. As the gain of the MME is known to remain constant for times 

of  order  months,  and  the  offset  terms  show  shorter-term  variability,  for  example 

temperature effects, this disparity is likely to be caused by leakage currents that have 

not been fully compensated for.  

6.4.1  Likely origin of conductivity offsets 
In  the  Current  Measurement  mode,  it  has  been shown (Section 5.6.2) appropriate to 

apply a correction based on the measured electrometer leakage current iL. In the MME 

follower  mode  (the  MME  schematic  is  given in Figure 5.6, and a description of the 

modes is in Appendix A) relays RL1, 5 and 2 are open, as shown in Figure 6.10. RL 2 

has no current path and RL5 is guarded, therefore the follower mode leakage current 

Chapter 6 

 

163 

PIMS atmospheric calibration and testing 

iF will be the sum of the leakages at the input, from RL2 and the op-amp input bias 

current.  In  the  leakage  check  mode,  which  monitors  op-amp  bias  and  electrometer 

leakage  currents,  the  leakage  current  iL  is  contributed  to  by  RL1,  the  op-amp  input 

bias current and leakages at the input.

Figure 6.10 Differences between the MME follower and leakage current measurement 

configurations a) and b). In this simplified diagram, an open relay is represented as a 

capacitor,  as  it  transiently  injects  charges  when  opening,  and  a  closed  relay  (thick 

line) is a direct connection. 

As both iF and iL principally originate from leakage across one relay, they are likely to 

be  similar  in  magnitude.  However,  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode,  current  is  not 

measured  directly,  and  has  to  be  inferred  from  the  overall  rate  of  decay.  It  can 

therefore be assumed unnecessary to correct for the leakage current in this mode, as 

long as the leakage can be considered to have a negligible effect on the rate of decay. 
The  contribution  to  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  conductivity  œÉv  from  the  electrometer 
leakage  current  iL  was  calculated,  and  subtracted  from  œÉv.  For  the  data  shown  in 

Figure  6.9,  this  changed  the  conductivity  by  2 %,  indicating  that  the  electrometer 

leakage currents are only one-fiftieth the size of the ion signal, which is comparable to 

the errors introduced from the bias voltage determination in Section 5.3. This shows 
that the electrometer leakage measurement has no distinguishable effect on œÉv, given 

its typical variability. Therefore, no corrections for electrometer leakage currents are 

applied to the data from the Voltage Decay mode during processing. 

Chapter 6

6.4.2  Negative conductivities 
A negative voltage repels negative ions flowing through the Gerdien tube towards the 

central electrode. When the negative ions reach the central electrode they cause a flow 

of  electrons,  and  by  convention  (e.g.  Bleaney  and  Bleaney,  1985)  this  leads  to  a 
negative current58. Including the sign of the bias voltage, conductivity calculated from 

Eq.  2.2  should  always  be  a  positive  value.  Hence,  currents  measured  at  the  central 

electrode should always be the same sign as the bias voltage, if they are entirely ionic 

in  origin.  Yet  Figure  6.9  clearly  shows  that  the  conductivity  is  sometimes  negative, 

because  ic  was  the  opposite  sign  to  the  bias  voltage.  The  behaviour  of  the  currents 
when of the opposite sign to the bias still conform to the trend and correlate with œÉv. 

This effect is therefore highly likely to be due to an offset imposed by some spurious 

source  of  current.  This  current  source  can  only  originate  from  three  places:  the 

electrometer,  Gerdien  tube  itself,  or  some  source  of  charge  external  to  the  PIMS 

system. Tube leakage currents are caused by insulator degradation, or build-up on the 

electrode surfaces. Although they probably do contribute some systematic error to the 

measurements,  the  effect  will  be  the  same  for  both  ion  measurement  modes,  and  is 

unlikely  to  be  the  cause  of  the offset in the current mode. Electrometer leakage is a 

possible contributor, but in the leakage checking mode, more relays are open than in 

the current mode, which should exceed the leakage currents that are not compensated 

for (see Section 5.6.2). To cause the persistent offset in Figure 6.9, the leakage from 

one relay alone would have to be comparable to the ion current, so the likelihood of 

this  originating  from  the  one  relay  which  is  not  compensated  for  in  the  leakage 

checking  mode  is  probably  small.  It  is  therefore  most  likely  that  the  offset  in  the 

Current  Measurement  mode  results  from  some  external  current  source,  and  of  a 

similar magnitude to the ion currents. 

 

6.4.3  Temporal inconsistencies 
Ion measurements in the two modes are made sequentially and are typically a minute 

apart.  If  there  are  short-term  fluctuations  in  the  air  passing  through  the  PIMS,  the 

changes in the air being sampled may be detected by consequent measurements in the 

two modes, which will introduce an error. There are significant turbulent fluctuations 

                                                           
58  An  electrical  current  flows  from  positive  to  negative,  but  the  flow  of  electrons  is  from  negative  to 
positive. Therefore a flow of negative charge is in the opposite direction to the current, so the current is 
negative.

in  the  air  of  timescales  from  several  minutes  to  milliseconds  (Stull,  1997).  As  the 

critical mobility is directly proportional to the wind speed, turbulence will continually 

modify  the  fraction  of  the  ion  spectrum  contributing  to  the  measurement,  and  may 

cause  disparities  between  consecutive  measurements  in  different  modes.  An 

arbitrarily selected hour of 1 Hz wind data at Reading University Meteorology Field 
Site, 1100-1200 on 12th June 2000, showed a maximum fluctuation of a factor of 4 on 

a  30 s  time-scale.  Since  the  five  minute  average  wind  speed  for  this  period  was 
3.4 ms-1, this corresponds to fluctuations in the range 6.8 (cid:150) 1.7 ms-1. At a typical bias 
voltage of 20 V, this causes changes in critical mobilities from 1.35 (cid:150) 0.33 cm2V-1s-1, 

spanning about half of the conventionally accepted small ion spectrum as defined by 

Hƒ±rrak et al (1999). This range is for a large fluctuation, but smaller variations in the 

wind  speed  will  also  have  some  effect  on  the  measurement.  Critical  mobility 

variations due to the voltage decay itself will affect the radius of ions contributing to 

the  measurement.  However  this  variation  (which  is  a  maximum  of  2.5 V)  will  be 

insignificant compared with the effect of turbulent fluctuations of wind speed, which 

is  the  major  factor  contributing  to  the  differences  between  the  two  measurement 

modes.  Further  differences  between  the  modes  (as  opposed  to  the  differences  in 

measuring  them),  and  the  effect  of  wind  fluctuations  on  the  ion  spectrum  will  be 

discussed in Chapter 7.

In  the  Current  Measurement  mode  (Figure  6.11),  there  is  an  agreement  between  the 
two  instruments60.  For  the  time  period  shown  in  Figure  6.11,  the  correlation 

coefficient  for  15-minute  averages  of  the  data  was  0.24.  However,  the  averaging 

period chosen is clearly significant when quantifying the level of agreement, since if 

the correlation coefficient is calculated for 1400-1530, then the positive correlation is 

much  higher  (0.87).  The  trends  in  conductivity  agree  well,  with  a  disparity  of  16 % 

between  the  mean  values.  The  Voltage  Decay  mode  measurements  also  concur  (15-

minute  average  correlation  coefficient  of  0.42),  with  the  means  separated  by  33 %, 

and the trends tracking each other. The major difference between the measurement of 

voltage and current with the MME is that the latter approach includes compensation 

for electrometer leakage currents. It is difficult to precisely evaluate the magnitude of 

the  follower  mode  electrometer  leakage currents,  iF because the relay configurations 

are significantly different to the leakage current check (see section 6.4), and they are 

likely  to  vary  with  different  relays  and  electronic  components.  An  indication  of  the 

difference  between  the  leakage  currents  from  different  instruments  can  be  observed 

by comparing measurements for the same time period from the leakage check mode, 

which are shown in Figure 6.13.

The measured electrometer leakage currents varied significantly; for PIMS 1 the mean 

leakage current was (cid:150) 26 fA, and for PIMS 2 it was (cid:150) 16 fA. As mentioned earlier, the 

measured follower mode leakage current iF is only contributed to by one of the three 

reed  relays  determining  iL,  so  iF  < iL,  but  iF  /iL is  probably constant,  if  it  is  assumed 

that each reed relay contributes a constant amount of current into the system. So it is 

not unreasonable to expect voltage decay measurements from two instruments (when 

iF  is  negligible,  but  not  precisely  known)  to  agree  less  well  than  current 

measurements, where iL is larger, but better-determined and compensated for. 

6.5.1  Local variations between the PIMSs 
As  different  air,  which  is  constantly  fluctuating  in  turbulent  eddies,  is  sampled  by 

each instrument, this will introduce some errors between the instruments due to local 
variations. The mean eddy size l can be estimated from von Karman(cid:146)s constant, Œ∫, at 

the height of the instruments, z (Stull, 1997), 

l Œ∫=
z

 

Eq. 6.8. 

Since  Œ∫ = 0.4  and  z = 1.5 m,  then  the  mean  eddy  size  is  of  comparable  scale  to  the 

instrument  separation,  suggesting  there  may  be  a  significant  spatial  variation  in  the 

wind speed, which may affect the ions sampled by the PIMS. 

Leakage across the electrode insulation will vary from instrument to instrument, but 

the  three  PIMS  are  mechanically  very  similar.  Evidence  for  this  is  that  the  Gerdien 

tubes only varied by 2 % in capacitance, which is an extremely sensitive parameter to 

changes  in  dimensions  (see  Eq.  2.17).  The  variations  in  the  bias  voltage  generator 

have been included in the software, since each PIMS instrument was controlled by a 

dedicated program with calibration differences accounted for (see Section 5.7.2). The 

fans ventilating the tubes will also behave slightly differently, but these variations will 

be small compared to the spatial effects of wind speed fluctuations. This appears the 

most  likely  cause  for  the  variability  between  instruments  not  attributed  to  leakage 

currents.

6.6  Comparing PIMS data to other ion measurements 

6.6.1  Ion measurements made with another design of Gerdien Condenser 
Conductivity  measurements  made  with  the  PIMS  were  compared  to  similar 

measurements  made  with  another  Gerdien  condenser  of  more  classical  design.  This  

design of instrument has been discussed by Blakeslee (1984) and widely applied, e.g. 

by Anderson and Bailey (1991) and Blakeslee and Krider (1992). The instrument used 

here was developed at the University of Arizona and will consequently be referred to 

as the "Arizona Gerdien".  

The  PIMS  and  the  Arizona  Gerdien  were  set  up  adjacent  to  each  other  at  Reading 

University Meteorology Field site on a fair weather day. The response of the Arizona 
Gerdien is given as 6.2 fSm-1V-1 at a bias voltage of 20 V(Blakeslee and Krider, 1992) 
which (from Eq. 6.1) corresponds to a current amplifier sensitivity of 0.88 pAV-1. 

A slight difference in the conductivities is to be expected from the two instruments, 

because  of  their  varying  critical  mobilities.  The  Arizona  Gerdien  is  significantly 

larger  than  the  PIMS  (a ~ 5 cm,  b ~ 0.5 cm),  therefore  it  is  impossible  to  exactly 

match  the  instruments(cid:146)  critical  mobilities  given  the  practical  limitations  to  bias 

voltages  and  flow  rates.  In  the  absence  of  an  ion  mobility  spectrum  for  the 

measurement  period,  the  difference  between  the  measurements  cannot  be  predicted. 

Primarily for this reason, the Ohmic response of the Arizona Gerdien was measured; 

an  additional  benefit  is  that  this  is  a  standard  test  that  the  Gerdien  condenser  is 

responding to atmospheric ions (Chalmers, 1967). If the Gerdien condenser is in the 

conductivity measurement r√ògime, the mean conductivity can be calculated from the 

gradient of the straight line fit to the Ohmic plot in Figure 6.14, m, which gives the 

average output current to bias voltage ratio for the measurement period. Hence, from 

Eq. 6.1 the conductivity is given by:

The PIMS output (Figure 6.16) appears similar to the Arizona Gerdien trace (Figure 

6.15). This suggests that the noise is independent of the instrument, and atmospheric 

ions  may  be  a  fundamentally  noisy  quantity.  The  main  processes  affecting  the 

atmospheric  ion  concentration:  production,  attachment  and  recombination  are  all 

constantly  fluctuating  in  rate  because  of  atmospheric  turbulence  and  the  stochastic 

nature  of  ionisation  processes.  The  air  sampled  by  the  instruments  is  also  rapidly 

changing in its qualities, because of the variability in the ion concentration discussed 
above,  and  turbulent  eddies  affecting  the  origin  of  the  air  sampled61.  However,  the 

mean  conductivities  from  the  two  instruments  agree  well:  the  PIMS  mean

Gerdien conductivity. It can be concluded that the PIMS can measure conductivity to 

within 2 % of the conductivity measured by a reference Gerdien condenser.

 Average conductivities 

Ion  measurements  in  the  literature  are usually presented as average values, although 

the amount of data averaged is often reasonably small, which suggests that textbook 

values should not necessarily be equated with reliability. In fact there is significantly 

more  data  presented  in  this  Thesis  than  in  much  classical  work  on  the  subject  (e.g. 
Chalmers, 1967) 62. To compare the PIMS conductivity data from Reading University 

Meteorology  Field  Site  with  such  historical  averages,  data  from  the  continuous 

measurement  campaign  from  April  (cid:150)  June  2000  was  averaged.  Measurements  were 

only  attempted  on  fair  weather  days,  so  that  the  atmospheric  electrical  conditions 

would  be  relatively  unperturbed  by  the  presence  of  hydrometeors  and  aerosol 

(Barlow,  2000).  The  definition  of  (cid:147)fair  weather(cid:148)  was  based  loosely  on  Reiter(cid:146)s 

criteria,  discussed  in  Barlow  (2000),  who  concluded  that  there  was  a  need  for 

                                                           
62In the group led by Chalmers at Durham (where I was an undergraduate in the Physics Department, 
and  Atmospheric  Electrical  work  had  sadly  long  since  ceased)  in  the  1960(cid:146)s,  two  days  of  consistent 
atmospheric electrical data was then considered an adequate amount for a PhD. Thesis (Jones, 1999).

redefinition of the term based on micrometeorological considerations. For the results 

presented  here,  the  major  consideration  for  starting  a  run  of  measurements  was  that 

there was less than 3/8 cloud cover, which was typically fair weather cumulus. 

 
The  conductivity  data  were  hourly  averaged  (<œÉ>),  and  then  filtered  based  on  the 

following criteria. 
‚Ä¢  <œÉ>  >  2iL

  is  a  pragmatic  treatment  of  the  errors  introduced  by  leakage.  The 

measured  leakage  current  iL  is  not  a  full  compensation  for  the  electrometer 

leakage,  because  there  is  one  reed  relay  unaccounted  for  between  the  MME 

current  measurement  and  leakage  check  modes.  Since  iL  is  mostly  leakage  from 

one  relay  (see  discussion  in  Section  6.4.1),  but  its  sign  is  not  known,  2iL  is 

therefore a conservative estimate for the uncompensated leakage current. 

‚Ä¢  <œÉ>  <  50  fSm-1  excludes  measurements  that  are  larger  than  the  theoretical 
maximum  ion  concentration,  for  q = 10 cm-3s-1.  In  the  recombination  limit  the 

maximum ion concentration can be easily calculated from Eq. 6.6, which gives an 
upper limit of 2500 ions cm-3. Since 
¬µ
 

œÉ ne‚âà

and the mean mobility of atmospheric small ions is 1.2 cm2V-1s-1 (e.g. Dolezalek, 
1974),  then  œÉmax ~  50 fSm-1.  This  is  an  absolute  maximum  upper  limit,  since  it 

assumes  an aerosol-free atmosphere, and any aerosol present (which there clearly 

is in urban Reading air) reduces the ion concentration.  

Conductivity values outside these limits are spurious, and caused by non-ionic current 

sources dominating the signal. When the conductivity is within the acceptable range, 

there  may  still  be  offsets  contributing  to  the  measurement,  but  the  filtering  criteria 

described  above only include measurements when the offset is small. Averaging the 

remaining data will further reduce the error due to random offsets. 

Measurements were made with the three PIMS on the mast at 1.25 m (see Figure 6.2) 

on 24 days in April, May and June 2000 for 292 hours. The total logging time is an 

average  across  the  three  PIMS  instruments;  they  ran  for  similar lengths of time, but 

                                                                                                                                                                      
Although  the  acquisition  of  data  is  now  more  straightforward,  the  frequency  of  suitable  fair  weather 
days is unlikely to have changed by orders of magnitude. 

Chapter 6

PIMS atmospheric calibration and testing 

this  varied  slightly  as  individual  PIMS  were  removed  for  cleaning  and  repair.  The 

measurement  periods  were  limited  by  the  weather  conditions,  for  example  in  April 

2000,  which  was  the  wettest  month  since  1756  (Eden,  2000a)  fair  weather  was  rare 

and  the  instruments  were  only  run  for  85  hours.  In  May,  the  first  half  of  the  month 

offered  some  good  measurement  days  (Eden,  2000b),  though  continual  (inaccurate) 

predictions  of  thunder  meant  the  logging  strategy  had  to  be  conservative  to  avoid 

possible  lightning  damage  from  transients  to  the  circuitry.  It  is  an  unfortunate 

vicissitude  of  the  British  climate  that  fair  weather  days  in  the  spring  and  summer, 

which  are  favourable  for  atmospheric  electrical  measurements,  are  when  the 

convective activity which leads to thunderstorms is most likely. The apparent need of 

weather forecasters to alert the public to even the slightest risk of thunder presents a 

further  problem,  since  instruments  designed  to  measure  fair  weather  quantities  (like 

the  PIMS)  may  not  be  able  to  withstand  the  dramatic  changes  associated  with 

thunderstorms. Measurements were therefore abandoned when thunder was predicted, 

which lost considerable logging time during fair weather, as well as the periods when 

the instruments were being maintained. 

 

After the filtering criteria described above had been applied to the whole set of hourly 

averages,  50 %  of  the  data  were  retained.  The  efficiency  of  the  two  modes  was 

different,  with  63  %  of  current  mode  data  retained  after  filtering  and  36  %  of  the 

Voltage Decay mode results. The voltage decay data was generally noisier and gave 

conductivities  which  were  greater  in  magnitude  than  those  from  the  current  mode. 

This  is  summarised  in  the  mean  data  shown  in  Table  6.2  below,  where  the  voltage 

decay mean and standard deviation are greater than in the current mode. The average 
air  conductivity  in  the  literature63  lies  between  the  means  for  the  two  modes  at  13  
fSm-1, but is obviously close to the current mode measurements.

Figure 6.17 Average diurnal variation in conductivity calculated by the two methods. 

Error  bars  are  the  standard  error  of  the  mean  for  each  set  of  hourly  averages,  for 

three instruments.  

 
Figure 6.17 shows the hourly conductivity averages, taken over 292 hours on 24 days 

and  averaged  across  the  PIMS instruments. The trends in conductivity calculated by 

the  two  methods  agree  well,  though  the  mean  values  differ.    The  pattern  of  this 

diurnal variation is similar to those in the literature, discussed in Section 2.2.3, with a 

pre-sunrise  peak  at  0400-0500,  due  to  a  maximum  in  the  ionisation  rate  caused  by 

thermal  stratification.  Throughout  the  day  conductivity  then  decreases,  which  is 

traditionally  explained  by  the  wind  increasing  after  midday  and  turbulent  mixing 

dispersing the radioactive gases contributing the majority of the ionisation (Chalmers, 

1967). As in Section 2.2.3, studying the trace from a local Geiger counter, which is a 

Chapter 6 

 

176 

PIMS atmospheric calibration and testing 

proxy  for  the  majority  of  the  ionisation  rate,  can  give  some  insight  into  this.  The 
Geiger counter output and the global solar radiation for an example day, 19th October 

1999,  are  shown  in  Figure  6.18;  from  midnight  to  sunrise  there  is  an  increasing 

ionisation  rate,  which  is  at  its  maximum  during  sunrise.  This  is  probably  caused  by 

the  stable  nocturnal  surface  layer  trapping  radioactive  gases  emitted  from  the  soil 
(such as radon), which cause most of the ionisation at the surface64.  

                                                           
64  Comparison  between the ion production rate and the ion concentration is more complicated during 
the day, because aerosol concentrations and wind speeds are more variable. This has been discussed in 
Section 2.2.3.

6.8  Conclusions 

This chapter has shown that the PIMS devices can measure ions consistently in both 

the  Current  Measurement  and  Voltage  Decay  modes.  The  instrument  responds  to 

fluctuations in the ionisation rate, and there is good agreement across both modes with 

the  same  instrument,  and  between  the  three  PIMSs.  Some  of  the  disagreements 

between  the  instruments  have  been  explained  in  terms  of  spatial  and  temporal 

inconsistencies in the air being sampled. The conductivity trends also agree with those 

recorded by another Gerdien instrument. The average diurnal variation found over 24 

days in a three-month period is concomitant with previous measurements, and many 

of its variations can be explained in terms of meteorological factors.

7  Variability in PIMS measurements 

 
 
The aim of this chapter is to resolve some uncertainties in the PIMSs data so that a set 

of  operating  conditions  can  be  defined  during  which  the  PIMS  is  measuring  small 

ions.  In  Chapter  6,  it  was  suggested  that  the  presence  of  charged  particulates  may 

have  a  deleterious  effect  on  the  measurements.  This  is  analysed  in  detail,  and  other 

sources of error are investigated to further refine the operating conditions. 

 

7.1  Effect of fluctuations in the flow 

7.1.1  The contribution of intermediate ions to conductivity 
The critical mobility is directly proportional to the wind speed (Equation 2.11), so at 

lower  wind  speeds  the  size  of  ion  contributing  to  the  conductivity  measurement 

increases. It can be hypothesised that greater conductivity is observed at night, when 

there is low wind in the stable nocturnal boundary layer (Stull, 1997), simply because 

intermediate  ions  are  contributing  to  the  measurement.  This  was  tested  using  data 

from a fair weather day, 3 May 2000 when there was a 24-hour set of hourly averaged 

conductivity data, which itself conformed to the diurnal variation frequently cited in 

the  literature  (Section  2.2.3).  The  maximum  radius  of  ion  contributing  to  the 

measurement, rmax, was calculated as in Section 3.2.2. The wind component inside the 

tube  was  calculated  from  Eq.  3.11  and  Eq.  3.12.  The  diurnal  variation  of  negative 

conductivity and rmax are shown in Figure 7.1. It is clear that almost all of the peaks in 

conductivity  coincide  with  maxima  in  rmax,  when  it  is  therefore  possible  that  more 

ions  are  contributing  to  the  conductivity.  For  the  day  chosen,  the  conductivity  is 

principally due to conventional small ions for the whole day, but at lower wind speeds 

rmax could easily encroach into the intermediate ion size range of r > ~ 1 nm (Hƒ±rrak 

et al, 2000), as also discussed in Section 3.2.2. This is important to recognise, because 

a significant contribution of intermediate and large ions to the conductivity has been 

theoretically shown to invalidate the traditional conductivity-aerosol relationship (see 

Section 2.4) by Dhanorkar and Kamra (1997).

If  the  measured  ion  size  is  not  considered,  as  is  conventional,  the  contribution  of 

larger  ions  can be misleading. They could make the measurements appear as if they 

are  conforming  to  the  expected  patterns,  when  in  reality  they  are only reflecting the 

fraction  of  the  ion  spectrum  contributing  to  the  measurement  rather  than  the  ion 

concentrations.  The  conventional  expression  for  conductivity  (Eq.  2.14)  can  be 

rewritten to take account of this

which  separates  the  contribution  of  the  intermediate  and  large  ions.  Ideally,  in 

conductivity measurement, the intermediate and large ions can be ignored when there 

are  few  of  them  because  their  mobilities  are  orders  of  magnitude  lower  than  small 

ions,  and  their  contribution  is  negligible.  Here  it  is  shown  that  under  certain 

circumstances,  intermediate  ions  can  be  measured  in  such  numbers  that  they  do 

contribute  to  the  conductivity  measurement.  Classical  ion-aerosol  theory  only  holds 

when  the  conductivity  is  entirely  due  to  small  ions,  because  intermediate  and  large 

ions  are  effectively  charged  aerosol  particles  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al,  2000),  so  the  spectral 

separation  between  them  becomes  indistinct.  Hence,  for  different  conductivity

Variability in PIMS measurements 

contributed to by small ions. 

 

If rmax is calculated from wind measurements made near to the ion measurement site, 

this problem can be alleviated by discarding data where rmax falls into the intermediate 

ion range. 1 Hz wind speed and direction measurements are made continually at 10 m 

at the Field Site, and five-minute averages from these data were used to rescreen the 

ion  data  presented  in  Section  6.6.2.  A  further  five  hours  of  data  were  rejected  on 

average for each PIMS, which reduced the total amount of data available for analysis 

by  a  further  2  %.  The  revised  diurnal  variations  are  shown  in  Figure 7.2, where the 

conductivity traces from the two methods are in better agreement both in magnitude 

and  in  trends  (this  is  summarised  in  Table  7.1).  The  correlation  coefficient  between 

conductivities calculated by the two methods is 0.51, which is improved compared to 

the correlation when the contribution of intermediate ions was ignored (0.34).

remove the contribution of intermediate ions. 

 
The  majority  of  changes  in  the  average  data  compared  to  Chapter  6  are  during  the 

night,  when  the  wind  speeds  drop  and  larger  ions  are  therefore  more  likely  to  be 

captured.  Since  the  data  from  the  daytime  remains  largely  unmodified,  the  poorer 

agreement between the two modes in the daytime is a consequence of turbulent gusts 

of  wind  affecting  the  ion  concentration  between  consecutive  measurements.  As  the 

atmospheric  surface layer is more stable at night, there is better temporal agreement 

between  measurements  made  asynchronously.  It  is  clearly  possible  for  intermediate 

ions  to  contribute  to  the  conductivity  during  still  periods,  particularly  at  night.  I 

believe, therefore, that this filtering procedure needs to be applied to all conductivity 

measurements  where  the  Gerdien  condenser  is  susceptible  to  fluctuations  in 

ventilation. Some filtering of existing data for rmax may be necessary with this factor 

in  mind.  Reanalysis  of  historic  measurements  has  been  previously  shown  to  be 

effective at improving conductivity measurements (Gunn, 1960; Andersen and Bailey, 
1991)66. 

 

7.1.2  Effect on the fraction of ions measured 
Measurement of wind speed and direction, and careful filtering of data should remove 

the effect of intermediate ions (r > 1 nm (Hƒ±rrak et al, 1999)) from analysed ion data, 

because  the  times  when  they  are  contributing  to  the  measurement  can  then  be 

identified.  However,  any  change  in  wind  speed  causes  a  variation  in  the  maximum 

radius of ions being measured, and hence a change in the fraction of the ion spectrum 

which  is  being  observed.  The  variation  of  ion  radius  with  external  ventilation  is 

shown below in Figure 7.3. rmax is derived from the flow rate in the tube, calculated as

due  to  the  inlet  pipes.  Although  inlet  ducting  will  damp  the  effects  of  turbulent  fluctuations  in  wind

tube, which causes the flow rate in the tube to change depending on the direction of 

the external wind.

Figure  7.3  Maximum  radius  of  measured  ions  with  the  external  ventilation  of  the 

Gerdien tube, at a typical bias voltage of 20 V. Flow in the tube is calculated from a 

polynomial fit to the external flow rate, and radius is calculated from a simple power 

law fit to approximate Tammet(cid:146)s (1995) expression. 

 
Figure 7.3 immediately shows that measurements made at very low flow rates permit 

intermediate  ions  to  contribute  to  the  conductivity,  and  must  be  discarded.  It  also 

shows  that  there  is  a  significant  variation  in  the  radius  of  ion  contributing  to  the 

measurement,  even  when  small  ions  only  are being measured. This will cause some 

uncertainty,  but  its  magnitude  will  depend  on  the  characteristics  of  the  ion  mobility 

spectrum.  For  example,  there  is  a  steep  change  in  the  radius  of  the  ions  measured 
between  flows  of  0 and -1 ms-1.  If  there  is  no  variation  in  the  number  of  ions  with 

radii  between  1.1  and  0.8 nm,  there  will  be  no  effect.  If  there  is  a  significant 

difference in the number of ions at the different radii, relatively small fluctuations in 

the  wind  speed  can  cause  a  large  error  in  the  apparent  determination  of  ion 

concentrations.  This error can be called the (cid:147)spectrum error(cid:148), and its magnitude can

Change in external ventilation (m/s)

 

Figure 7.4 Estimated spectrum error at a bias voltage of 20 V, from 1 ms-1 changes in 

external ventilation. 

 
Figure 7.4 gives an estimate of the error in the measurement due to the non-uniform 

nature  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrum.  At  higher  wind  speeds  rmax  is  lower,  but  the 

PIMS  is  measuring  in  a  steeper  part  of  the  ion  mobility  distribution  so  there  is  a 
greater  variation  in  the  size  of  ion  measured  in  a  1 ms-1  range  of  wind  speeds.  The 
least desirable range of external wind components is from 0 to -1 ms-1, because in this 

range the ions measured change from intermediate to small, and rmax  is quite sensitive 
to  wind  speed.  Although  the  spectrum  is  flat  from  0 (cid:150) 1  ms-1,  intermediate  ions  are 

making  up  the  majority  of  the  conductivity  so  this  data  should  be  discounted. 

Conductivity measurements when there is high external ventilation (i.e. for the PIMSs 

orientation used in this Thesis(cid:146) experiments, strong southerly winds) should be treated 

with  caution,  because  errors  are  introduced  as  the  number  of  ions  being  measured 

varies  sharply  with  wind  speed.  The  most  favourable  wind  speeds  for  conductivity

measurement are moderate ones in the range 1-3 ms-1, which permit measurement of 

small ions in a relatively smooth part of the spectrum. 

7.2  Physical differences between the modes 

In the Current Mode, some preliminary averaging is carried out by the microcontroller 

before the sample is sent to the logging PC. In the Voltage Decay mode, conductivity 

is  calculated  from  an  exponential  fit  to  10  2 Hz  samples.  If  a  transient  occurs,  for 

example a charged aerosol particle advected onto one of the Gerdien electrodes, this 

will  cause  a  perturbation  to  the  electrical  charge  of  the  central  electrode  which  is 

proportional to the charge of the particle. If this occurs whilst current measurements 

are  being  made,  the  transient  effect  is  likely  to  be  smoothed  out  by  averaging,  and 

contributes little to the current. In the Voltage Decay mode, the charge on the central 
electrode is logged at twice the speed, for half the time67, so any transient is likely to 

be  measured  and  sent  serially  to  the  PC  where  it  may  cause  the  fluctuations  in  the 

(cid:147)decay(cid:148)  time  series  shown  in  Figure  6.6.  A  fluctuation  of  1 V  can  be  estimated  to 

cause  the  voltage  decay  trace,  which  has  a  maximum  range  of  2.5 V,  to  deviate 

considerably  from  the  expected  exponential.  This  is  equivalent  to  a  charged  aerosol 

particle  carrying  picoCoulombs  and  impacting  on  Gerdien  electrodes  (the  Gerdien 

condenser typically has a capacitance of 10 pF). Aerosol which is not in steady-state, 

or is in a new region of ionisation, for example particles less than a few minutes old 

(Harrison,  1992)  can  be  charged  highly  enough  (i.e.  10 pC),  to  cause  such 

perturbations.  If  one  decay  measurement  lasts  for  5  s,  then  a  volume  of  about  5  x  
10-3 m3 of air passes through the Gerdien, assuming a flow rate of 2 ms-1. As 60 % of 
the  voltage  time  series  have  a  positive  <‚àÜV/‚àÜt>, then this corresponds to about one 
failure case per 100 m3 of air. This is equivalent to one charged particle per 5 m edge 

cube of air, which appears a possible explanation for the observed proportion of non-

exponential  decays.  In  addition  to  non-equilibriated  aerosol  particles,  there  are 

numerous other air-borne sources of highly charged particles, for example a bumble-

bee  (bombus  terrestris)  can  carry  50 pC  (Harrison,  1997b),  and  highly-charged 

particles can be produced by mechanical processes.

7.3  Offset currents measured at zero bias voltage 

When  there  is  zero  bias  voltage  Vb  across  the  Gerdien  electrodes,  the  ionic  current 

measured  should  be  negligible,  since  there  is  no  electric  field  in  the  tube.  The  only 

ions  which  will  be  measured  are  those  which  collide  with  the  electrodes  by  chance 

due  to  mechanical  motions.  MacGorman  and  Rust  (1998)  refer  to  the  process  of 

correcting the ion current by subtracting this zero current as (cid:147)dynamic zeroing(cid:148). They 

suggest it is the best way to zero the Gerdien system since it accounts for ionic noise 

in the tube. However, this ionic noise signal is likely to be negligible compared to the 

contribution also present from larger charged particles. Aerosol particles easily carry 

several  units  of  electronic  charge  (Clement  and  Harrison,  1992),  and  can  be 

influenced by mechanical forces. So the current when Vb = 0 should give an estimate 

of the noise levels due to the presence of chance ionic and particulate, impaction onto 

the electrodes.  

 

The  current  at  the  central  electrode  when  Vb = (0 ‚Äì 1) V,  which  will  be  referred  to 

here  as  iV=0  was  measured  for  43  hours  of  fair  weather  using  PIMS  2  at  Reading 

University  Meteorology  Field  Site  from  2 - 4  May  2000.  The  same  instrument  also 

measured the currents at Vb = + 25.0 and Vb = (cid:150) 19.8 V. The first observation was that 

iV=0 was comparable in magnitude with currents measured at the higher voltages (here 

called iV=-20  and  iV=+25), which suggests that it is possible for particles in the tube to 

cause  a  significant  offset  in  the  measurements.  iV=0  also  showed  a  close  agreement  

with  both  iV=-20    and  iV=+25,  and  a  time  series  of  iV=0  and  iV=+25  is  plotted  below  to 

illustrate this. Since electrical forces seem to have no effect on the current measured, 

there must be a mechanical process acting in both cases.

One  approach  which  can  be  adopted  is  to  investigate  the  distribution  of  the  noise 

current.  A  random  source  of  errors  is  Gaussian  in  distribution  (Horowitz  and  Hill, 

1994), and if there are other processes affecting iV=0, then the distribution will not be 

Gaussian.  The  distribution  of  iV=0    for  the  same  data  set  plotted  in  Figure  7.5  was 

calculated for two contrasting cases. The first case is when iV=0  is clearly dominating 

the signal, defined by the presence of a negative current when the PIMS should only 

be  responding  to  positive  ions.  The  second  case  is  the  average  distribution  for  the 

whole  time  series.  The  distributions  are  plotted  in  Figure  7.6  below.  For  the  whole 

time series, the distribution is approximately Gaussian, although there is a slight bias 

in  the  tail  towards  positive  currents.  The  peak  is  in  the  current  bin  of  0 (cid:150) 0.2 pA, 

which shows that the iV=0 signal is small for most of the time. The distribution when 

iV=0 is large however, is much less symmetrical, with more frequent negative currents, 

and  less  frequent  positive  currents.  The  peak  is  broad  and  spans  larger  negative 

currents than the average distribution. This asymmetry shows that the noise has a non-

Gaussian  distribution  (Berthouex  and  Brown,  1994)  when  it  dominates  the  signal  at 

larger bias voltages, compared to the mean distribution of iV=0. This suggests that iV=0

Figure 7.6 Distribution of currents at Vb = 0 for the whole measurement period, and 

for  the  period  when  iV = 0  is  dominating  the  ion  signal.  The  relative  number  of 

occurrences of each current is plotted against the mean current of the 0.2 pA bin, e.g. 

N(i) at 0.5 pA represents the fraction of readings for which a current between 0.2 and 

0.4 pA  was  measured.  Gaussian  fits  to  the  distribution  are  also  shown.  Correlation 

coefficients to a Gaussian distribution for the whole data set and the case where noise 

dominates were 0.98 and 0.95 respectively. 

 

Having  now  established  that  iV=0  can  be  an  important  source  of  noise  in  the 

measurements, the characteristics of the signal were investigated further. In the period 

when  iV=0  was  considered  to  be  dominating  the  signal,  it  showed  a  good  agreement 

with  the  wind  component  into  the  PIMS,  illustrated  in  Figure  7.7.  This  strongly 

implies that the origin of the dominant negative current is being blown into the tube 

by the wind.

Figure 7.7 A 4 hour 50 minute section of the iV = 0 time series (left hand axis) plotted 

against 5 minute averages of the wind component into the tube (right hand axis). 

A  possible  origin  for  the  high  currents  observed  at  Vb = 0  is  particulate  space 
charge68 drifting on to the Gerdien condenser electrodes. Space charge was measured 
at  Reading  University  Meteorology  Field  Site  with  an  Obolensky-type  device69,  on 
25th February 2000. Ion measurements with PIMS 1 at a bias voltage of (cid:150) 30.7 V were 

also made. A time series of conductivity and the uncalibrated (negative) space charge 

meter  output,  plotted  in  Figure  7.8  below,  indicates  a  positive  relationship  between 

the two quantities. This shows that the Gerdien condenser can respond to space charge 

for  at  least  the  measured  period.  However,  the  contribution  of  space  charge  to  the 

conductivity  measurement  cannot  be  determined,  as  the  exact  response  of  the  space 

charge  instrument  is  not  known.  In  order  to  ascertain  the  magnitude  of  the 

contribution, the partitioning of the space charge between aerosol and ions would also 

need  to  be  understood.  Since  conductivity  measurement  by  definition  directly 

                                                           
68 Space charge is a generic term for all the free charge per unit volume carried on particles in the air. It 
is partitioned between the charge carried by aerosol particles and small ions (Chalmers, 1967).  
69 The Obolensky (1925) space charge meter uses a filter to collect the space charge so that the current 
from  it  can  be  measured.  Obolensky  (1925)  used  cotton  wool,  but  the  instrument  fabricated  and 
deployed  at  Reading  uses  steel  wool  as  the  filter.  The  tube  used  was  approximately  20 cm  long  and 
2 cm in diameter, ventilated with the same fan as the PIMS at an approximate flow rate of 2 ms-1. The

determines small ion concentrations, and therefore includes ionic space charge, if the 
majority of the space charge on 25th February was ionic, then it is not surprising that 

the two instruments agree. However, if the space charge were mainly charged aerosol, 

then the accord between the PIMS and space charge detector might indicate an error 

in the ion measurements due to the effect of particulate space charge. This is in itself 

inconclusive, but the relationship between the wind velocity and space charge can be 

used to estimate whether the space charge is primarily ionic or particulate. If the space 

charge  is  primarily  particulate  it  will  be  influenced  by  the  wind  speed,  but  if  it  is 

ionic, there will be a poor relationship between space charge and wind speed because 

ions are not influenced by mechanical forces. Figure 7.9 is a plot of the space charge 

detector output with wind speed. It can be seen that there is no relationship between 

the two quantities, therefore it can be concluded that for this period, the majority of 

the space charge is ionic.

Figure  7.9  Space  charge  detector  voltage  as  a  function  of  wind  component  into  the 

space charge detector, for the same time period as Figure 7.8. 

For the measurements made on 2 - 4 May 2000 at Vb = 0, the overall distribution was 

close  to  Gaussian  and the magnitude was small. This indicates that iV=0  is randomly 

generated noise, the effect of which can therefore be reduced by averaging. However, 

the same signal as that recorded at iV=0 sometimes dominates the measured ion signal 

at higher bias voltages, and can cause a large enough offset for the measured currents 

to  be  the  opposite  sign  to  the  bias  voltage.  For  these  periods  iV=0  shows  a  close 

agreement with the external wind component. It is therefore almost certain that when 

the current is the opposite sign to Vb, the source of the noise causing it (measured at 
Vb = 0) is carried by the wind. On a different day (25th February 2000), space charge 

was also related to the ion signal (correlation between 15-minute averages was 0.23), 

in which there were no periods of large offset. Since the space charge was unrelated to 

the  wind  speed  on  this  day  (Figure  7.9),  then  it  must  have  been  primarily  ionic  in 

composition. In the example of the noise dominating the ion signal plotted in Figure 

7.7,  there  is  evidence  that  additional  negatively  charged  particles  blown  in  by  the 

wind are the source of the noise. According to Kamra (1992), negative space charge is 

carried by the wind, so the results presented here confirm his hypothesis.

Variability in PIMS measurements 

The problem of particulate space charge contributing to the conductivity measurement 

is likely to be worst when there are high aerosol concentrations, as there are lower ion 

concentrations due to attachment. The combination of a greater proportion of charged 

aerosol  causing  more  noise,  and  the  associated  reduced  ion  signal  will  diminish  the 

signal-to-noise  ratio.  Early  radiosonde  measurements  of  voltage  decays  outside  the 

boundary  layer  (Hatakayema  et  al,  1958;  Venkiteshwaran,  1958)  had  a  high 

proportion of successful decays, unlike the PIMS measurements at ground level. This 

supports  the  concept  that  the  PIMS  measurements  are  perturbed  by  charged  aerosol 

particles being blown into the Gerdien tube, as aerosol concentrations fall with height 

(Pruppacher and Klett, 1997). The effect of particulate space charge is thought to be 

the principal source of noise in the instrument. 

In the ion measurements presented above and in Chapter 6, the approach to filtering 

was to prevent currents with a large non-ionic offset from being considered as small 

ion  measurements.  The  screening  procedure  used  in  Section 6.7 was appropriate for 

this  purpose,  because  it  has  excluded  measurements  when  the  noise  currents  were 

large.  A  better  criterion  for  data  filtering  would  be  to  exclude  data  where  the  space 

charge  was  known  to  be  particulate,  which  would  eliminate  all  ion  measurements 

containing a contribution from particulate space charge. 

 

 

7.4  Ionic sources of noise 

7.4.1  Atmospheric ion fluctuations 
The  main  source  of  ionic  noise  is  fluctuations  in  the  ion  concentration  itself  -  here 

called  ionisation  noise.  The  ion  production  rate,  measured  with  a  Geiger  counter, 

shows  high  short-term  variability  (see  Figure  6.7  for  an  example  time  series). 

Fluctuations  in  the  ion  concentration  are  damped  by  self-recombination  and 

attachment to aerosol, but ion-aerosol timescales to reach steady-state concentrations 

are  of  order  100 s  (Harrison,  1992).  As  it  takes  about one-eighth of a second for an 

ion  to  be  sucked  through  the  Gerdien  at  typical  flow  rates,  the  effects  of  a  local 

transient in the ion production rate are likely to be detected before a local steady-state 

in the tube has been reached. Further evidence for the sensitivity of the instrument to 

ionic  fluctuations  has  been  observed  directly  by  sealing  the  ends  of  the  Gerdien 

condenser  and  measuring  the  current.  On  a  chart  recorder  trace,  small  peaks  can  be

seen, which must be attributed to individual ionisation events in the tube, because the 

sealed  tube  prevents  new  ions  entering.  These  fluctuations  probably  originate  from 

genuinely  stochastic  processes  such  as  radioactive  decay,  and  high-energy  particles 

from cosmic rays. However, the sample high-frequency traces shown in Section 6.6.1, 

when  the  PIMS  was  compared  to  another  Gerdien  condenser,  indicate  that  this 

sensitivity is a common feature of all Gerdien-like instruments. 

 

 

 

 

7.4.2  Shot noise 
Horowitz and Hill (1994) describe the shot noise induced in an electronic system by 

the discrete nature of the charge carriers. This could be thought directly relevant to the 

PIMS  systems,  where  the  current  conceptually  results  from  the  effect  of  individual 

particles,  rather  than  the  continual  (cid:147)flow(cid:148)  of  electrons  perceived  in  higher  current 

devices. Shot noise is more important at small currents, such as those measured from 

the  PIMSs,  because  the  fractional  effect  of  the  individual  charge  carriers  is  greater 

when the mean current is low. An expression for the current due to shot noise, ishot, 

can be derived from Fourier analysis (Bleaney and Bleaney, 1985) 

where  i  is  the  measured  direct  current,  and  B  is  the  bandwidth  of  the  measurement. 

The  average  measured  PIMSs  current  is  about  300 fA.  The  bandwidth  can  be 
estimated from the RC time constant œÑ of the current amplifier

errors, such as the input bias current of the op-amp. 

7.5  Conclusions 

The effect of wind fluctuations is significant, because at low wind speeds intermediate 

ions  contribute  directly  to  the  conductivity  measurement.  Further  screening  of  data 

has  been  shown  to  remove  this  effect,  improving  the  agreement  between  the  two 

measurement modes so that they match almost exactly at night. The poorer agreement 

between  the  two  modes  in  the  afternoons  suggests  that  the  wind  is  fluctuating

Variability in PIMS measurements 

sufficiently rapidly for five-minute averages to be an inadequate basis for comparison. 

This is supported by the evidence presented here, that the external ventilation varies 

significantly on temporal and length scales comparable with the PIMS measurements. 

Failure cases have been accounted for by aerosol effects, except for a slight negative 

offset  in  the  current  measurements.  This  offset  may  also  help  to  explain  the 

differences in the mean values between the two methods.  

 

Additional  sources  of  uncertainty  have  been  investigated,  and  drift  of  particulate 

space charge onto the Gerdien electrodes appears to be the major source of noise in 

the  data.  Fluctuations  in  the  wind  speed  causing  variability  in  the  fraction  of  the 

spectrum  being  measured  are  also  significant  at  higher  flow  rates.  The  PIMS 

instruments  are  both 

self-consistent  and 

reproduce  absolute  conductivity 

measurements made in urban air. However, significant filtering is required to remove 

poor  data,  when  intermediate  ions  are  contributing  to  the  conductivity,  and  when 

leakage currents are excessive. Based on the investigations in this chapter, it is now 

possible  to  define  a  detailed  set  of  operating  criteria  based  on  instrumental  and 

physical considerations. These are summarised in Table 7.2.

8  Observations of ion spectra and ion-aerosol interactions 

 
Atmospheric observations made with the PIMS are described in this chapter, with the 

aim  of  showing  that  the  PIMS  is  a  novel  instrument  capable  of  obtaining  new 

atmospheric  results.  A  technique  to  obtain  ion  mobility  spectra  by  inverting  voltage 

decay  data  is  explained  in  Section  8.2.  Spectra  are  also  calculated  from  both 

measurement  modes  (Sections  8.3.1  and  8.3.2);  the  two  spectra  are  compared  with 

each  other,  and  another  measured  spectrum  in  Section  8.3.3.  Ion  measurements  are 

analysed with respect to aerosol number concentration in Section 8.4.  

8.1  Ion spectra 

An ion mobility spectrum was defined in Chapter 2 as the distribution of ion number 
concentration n(¬µ) across the range of mobilities ¬µ. It can be readily converted into a 

size  spectrum  using  the  expression  derived  by  Tammet  (1995),  or  by  the  empirical 

power  law  fit  to  the  ion-mobility  data  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al,  1999)  which  was  described  in

The simplest possible mobility distribution is when all ions have the same mobility, in 

which case the mobility spectrum is unimodal, as shown in Figure 8.1.

However, when the number of ions with each mobility changes, the conductivity has 

to  be  expressed  in  integral  form.  As  conductivity  by  definition  is  related  to  the 

concentration of all atmospheric small ions, the limits of this equation must be chosen 
to exclude intermediate ions, and therefore have a lower limit of 0.05 cm2V-1s-1. The 

upper  limit  is  infinity  because  an  infinitely  small  ion  will  have  infinitely  large 

mobility.

The assumption of an invariant ion mobility spectrum, leading to Eq. 8.2 above, has 

long been used to estimate ion concentrations from conductivity measurements made 

with Gerdiens (e.g. Shimo et al, 1972; Dhanorkar and Kamra, 1993). The assumption 

has  been  more  fundamentally  deployed  in  the  derivation  of  conductivity  from  time 

decay  measurements  from  a  Gerdien  condenser  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode.  This

 Observations of ion spectra and ion-aerosol interactions 

Methods to measure and calculate ion mobility spectra have been outlined in Chapter 

2, but in summary, they are measured by varying the mobility of ions contributing to 

the  measurement,  and  then  counting  the  number  at  the  selected  mobility.  This  has 

typically  been  effected  by  varying  the  distance  the  ions  have  to  travel  to  reach  the 

detector, or by varying the electric field the ions are moving in so that one mobility 

range  is  selected.  Results  from  these  measurements  have  shown  that  there  is  a  non-

uniform  mobility  spectrum  (e.g.  Misaki,  1964;  Mohnen,  1974;  Hƒ±rrak  et  al  2000; 

some examples of mobility spectra are given in Chapter 2). 

8.2  Effect of ion mobility spectrum on voltage decays 

In the Voltage Decay mode, the changing voltage across the Gerdien electrodes varies 

the electric field strength in the tube, which has the effect of scanning through a range 

of mobilities during the measurement. This means that the assumption that a constant 

number of ions contribute to the measurement at all times is invalidated when there is 

a  non-uniform  mobility  spectrum.  In  the  special  case  when  all  ions  have  the  same 

mobility,  the  theory  leading  to  Eq.  8.4  is  correct.  However,  when  there  is  a  varying 

spectrum, the decay cannot be an ideal exponential; its degree of deviation from the 

exponential  depends on the characteristics of the spectrum. Therefore, every voltage 

decay  time  series  holds  spectral  information,  if  it  has  sufficient  resolution,  although 

there may not be a solution to the inversion problem in general. 

This  is  analogous  to  the  classic  Gerdien  test,  the  Ohmic  response.  It  is  well-known 

that if a Gerdien is responding correctly to the presence of air ions, a plot of output 

current  against  bias  voltage  will  be  linear.  In  reality,  varying  the  bias  voltage  varies 

the critical mobility throughout the spectrum, so that if there are species of ions with 

different  mobilities,  the  plot  will  deviate  slightly  from  a  linear  one.  However,  when 

the  spectrum  is  unimodal,  a  Gerdien  i-Vb  plot  should  be  an  ideal  straight  line.  The 

conceptualisation of spectral information concealed within the experimental deviation 

from  the  most  na(cid:239)ve  theoretical  predictions  has  previously  been  exploited  by  Nolan 

(1920) to calculate ion spectra from the (cid:147)Ohmic(cid:148) response.

8.2.1  Voltage decay for a parameterised mobility spectrum 
It is possible to derive an expression which slightly modifies the theory of calculating 

conductivity  from  an  exponential  decay  of  the  voltage  across  a  capacitor  (given  in 

Section    2.2.2)  to  take  account  of  a  non-uniform  ion  mobility  spectrum.  This  starts 

with  the  exponential assumption applied in Chapter 6 to compute conductivity from 

PIMS  time  series  measured  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode.  Rearrangement  of  Eq.  6.4 

gives  the  voltage  at  the  central  electrode  Vt  at  a  time  t  after  the decay is started (by 

disconnecting  the  voltage  charging  up  the  electrodes),  which  is  related  to  the 
conductivity œÉ and the initial voltage V0 by

When the mobility spectrum is non-uniform, Eq. 8.2 can be substituted for œÉ in Eq. 

8.5. The limits of the integral in Eq. 8.3. are equivalent to the mobility range of the 
measurement; since critical mobility ¬µc and voltage V are inversely related by  

(see  Section  3.1.2)  the  maximum  and  minimum  critical  mobilities  ¬µct  and  ¬µc0  are 

measured at Vt and V0 respectively:

calculating  conductivity  from  exponential  decay  (Eq.  8.5.).  Hence,  it  is  possible  to 

predict  the  shape  of  the  voltage  decay,  given  a  prescribed  initial  ion  spectrum  by 

integrating Eq. 8.7.

 Observations of ion spectra and ion-aerosol interactions 

To  investigate  this  modification  to  the  exponential  theory,  a  reference  ion  spectrum 

was required to substitute in Eq. 8.7.. A Gaussian spectrum was fitted to an existing 

ion spectrum from 1700 hours of Estonian ion data (Tammet et al, 1992). The integral 
under  the  Gaussian  curve  gave  a  total  ion  concentration  of  N = 127 cm-3,  for  ions 
measured in the mobility range 0.36 (cid:150) 2.84 cm2V-1s-1. The decay integral Eq. 8.7. was 

solved  to  give  a  derived  voltage  decay  time  series  for  the  Estonian  reference 
spectrum,  using  a  Turbo  Pascal  program,  DECINT70.  Eq.  8.7.  was  also  solved  for  a 

unimodal  mobility  spectrum,    which  gave  the  ideal  exponential  decay.  The 

characteristics of the unimodal spectrum were prescribed with typical concentrations 
and  mobilities,  N  = 100 cm-3,  and  ¬µ = 1 cm2V-1s-1  (e.g.  Chalmers,  1967).  A  sample 

voltage  range  of  10 - 0V  was  used  to  simulate  the  decay.  The  voltage  decay  trace 

calculated when there is a unimodal mobility spectrum was exponential. Therefore a 

unimodal  ion  spectrum  can  be  inverted  to  give  the  expected  exponential  decay  of 

potential across the Gerdien electrodes.

 Observations of ion spectra and ion-aerosol interactions 

 
As  predicted  above,  the  voltage  decay  trace  calculated  from  a  real  (modelled  by  a 

Gaussian) ion spectrum is a poorer fit to an exponential decay, though an exponential 

explains  85 %  of  the  variance  in  the  trace.  This  shows  that  when  there  is  a  non-

uniform mobility spectrum, the voltage decay method of calculating conductivity does 

not  give  the  ideal  exponential.  Instead,  measurements  of  voltage  against  time  are 

clearly able to generate a quasi-exponential decay. The ideal exponential decay is of 

course  a  special  case,  which  is  only  expected  when  all  ions  have  the  same  mobility 

and on which conventional theory depends. 

 

 

8.2.2  Inversion problem 
Inverting a set of voltage decay measurements to get an ion spectrum numerically is 

in  general  impossible,  but  can  be  approximated  by  suitable  assumptions.  If  it  is 

assumed  that  the  characteristics  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrum  vary  negligibly  in  a 

small mobility range, i.e. that the ion spectrum is a superposition of many unimodal 

distributions,  the problem can be simplified. The technique of fitting an exponential 

and calculating conductivity from Eq. 8.5., and then deducing ion concentration from 

Eq. 8.2 would then be applicable for small segments of each voltage decay time series 

(if  they  are  sufficiently  small).  This  piecewise  inversion  approach  can  be  tested  by 

applying  the  technique  to  the  theoretically  derived  voltage  decay  shown  above  in 

Figure 8.2; if this assumption is valid, a spectrum calculated in this way should match 

the original ion spectrum from which the voltage decay was obtained. 

A quasi-exponential decay found using DECINT with a Gaussian input spectrum was 

broken down into sets of three consecutive values. If there are ten values of Vt and t 

from (V1,t1) to (V10,t10), then the first set of three is (V1-3,t1-3), the second (V2-4,t2-4), and 

so on up to  (V10,t10). An exponential curve fit was then applied to each set of three 

(V,t) points to calculate the conductivity for this part of the decay. The voltage at the 

middle of the three points was used to calculate the critical mobility, and from this ion 

number  concentration.  The  ion  spectrum  obtained  by  this  technique  was  then 

compared to the measured Estonian ion spectrum, shown in Figure 8.3. 

                                                                                                                                                                      
sequentially.  The  decay  time  is  found  between  each  pair  of  voltages  and  then  the  values  plotted 
inversely (i.e. as voltage as a function of time).

Figure 8.3 Ion mobility spectra reconstructed from voltage decay time series derived 

from  the  reference  Estonian  ion  spectrum.  The  shape  of  the  reconstructed  spectrum 

depends  on  the  flow  speed  chosen;  two  typical  speeds  are  chosen  here  which  best 

represent  the  measured  spectrum  in  width  and  height  (u  would  normally  be  known 

from measurements). 

The  total  number  of  ions  N  calculated  from  integrating  a  Gaussian  fit  to  the  data 

points was exactly equal between the reconstructed and measured spectra. However, 

the form of the decay depended on the flow rate u, which had to be arbitrarily chosen 

to  calculate  the  critical  mobility  and  ion  concentration.  The  relationship  between 
¬µc, and u (Eq. 8.2) meant that selecting a faster flow resulted in fewer ions at a higher 

mobility.  In  Figure  8.3,  spectra  at  two  wind  speeds  which  produced  the  curve  most 

closely  matching  the  measured  spectrum  in  magnitude  and  mobility  have  been 

This has shown that the total ion concentration can be reproduced by fitting a series of 

exponential  decays  to  small  sections  of  a  non-exponential  set  of  measurements  of 

voltage  and  time.  This  can  be  considered  a  piecewise  inversion  of  Eq.  8.7.  The  ion 

spectrum can also be derived in the same way; but the parameters depend on the wind 

speed.  It  is  also  necessary  to  assume  that  the  ion  spectrum  changes  smoothly  and

slowly  with  ¬µ.  In  the  hypothetical  test  case  above,  there  is  no  reason  to  prefer  any 

wind speed over another, so a range of values may be used. However, when deriving 

ion spectra from real voltage decay data, measured wind speeds will be used so that 

the  critical  mobilities  can  be  determined  and  facilitate  comparisons  with  spectra 

calculated conventionally from Current Mode measurements.  

8.3  Measured atmospheric ion spectra 

A data set from 1000-1700 on 18th June 2000 was chosen from which to calculate an 

average ion spectrum by two methods from the two PIMS measurement modes. This 

day was selected because of the fair weather, no cloud and moderate wind speeds, so 

that the atmospheric electrical conditions would remain approximately constant over 

the  averaging  period.  Two  PIMS  instruments,  1  and  2,  were  also  returning  a  high 

proportion of valid data from both modes for the whole period. 

 

 

8.3.1  Current Measurement method 
In the Current Measurement mode, the critical mobility is varied by changing the bias 

voltage  across  the  Gerdien  (Eq.  8.6).  Since  a  discrete  set  of  measurements  at  each 

mobility is obtained by this method, spectra have to be calculated by differencing the 

measurements  made  at  two  adjacent  bias  voltages.  There  also  has  to  be  some  delay 

between  the  measurements  made  at  different  bias  voltages to allow the electrometer 

time  to  recover  from  the  switching-induced  transients  (see  Section  5.6.3).  By 

necessity therefore, this technique requires some temporal or spatial separation of the 

measurements to be differenced, and associated assumptions about temporal or spatial 

consistency  of  the  ion  spectrum.  Differencing  measurements  made  with  the  same 

sampling  instrument  several  minutes  apart  was  thought  to  be  inadvisable,  given  the 

large fluctuations in ion production rate and wind speed that occur on relatively short 

timescales (see Chapter 6). Instead, measurements from two PIMSs were used. These 

were  not  exactly  simultaneous,  (despite  the  efforts  to  synchronise  the  instruments 

described 

in  Section  5.7.3)  because  of  non-linear  drift 

in 

the 

individual 

microcontrollers(cid:146) timing circuits. Data were only selected for differencing when they 

were close enough together for the traces of conductivity to be steady to a timescale 

longer  than  the  differencing  timescale,  i.e.  when  it  can  be  assumed  that  the  ion 

spectrum is steady. For this data set, a conservative maximum temporal separation of 

Chapter 8 

 

203 

 Observations of ion spectra and ion-aerosol interactions 

2 minutes was selected, as the conductivity trace remained steady on about a 5-minute 

timescale.  (A  closer  minimum  separation  would  be  preferable,  but  this  would  reject 

too  much  of  the  data  to  average  the  spectra.)  The  small  volume  flow  rate  into  the 
PIMSs (of order 10-4 m3s-1) also justifies this temporal differencing strategy; the mean 

electrical conditions in the locality of the PIMSs in fair weather are known not to be 

changing rapidly, and each instrument only samples a small amount of the air in the 
vicinity (10-3 m3) on the timescales chosen. 

 
n(¬µ) is calculated by assuming the ion population remains constant over the time scale 

of the measurements, so the difference in conductivity between the two measurements 

is  proportional  to the number of ions between the two critical mobilities. Data were 

filtered according to the criteria set in Chapter 7, and the mean critical mobility was 

calculated  from  the  mean flow in the tube for the measurement period, and the bias 

voltage.  The  bias  voltage  sequences  are  shown  in  Table  8.1.  The  measurements  at 

positive  bias  voltage  from  PIMS  2  have  not  been  included  in  calculation  of  the 

spectrum.

Eq. 8.9. 

The mean critical mobility was calculated from Eq. 3.1 using the mean of the two bias 

voltages,  and  the  mean  wind  component  in  the  tube  over  the  averaging  period. 

Uncertainties were computed as in Section 8.3.2 above, from the standard error of the 

mean of the flow and the ion concentration. Results are discussed in Section 8.3.3. 

 

 

8.3.2  Voltage Decay method 
The  ion  concentration  at  a  given  critical  mobility  was  calculated  by  deriving  the 

conductivity by exponential fitting to adjacent voltage decay data in each decay. The 

Chapter 8

 Observations of ion spectra and ion-aerosol interactions 

method  was  as  described  above  for  the  reference  spectrum,  moving  sequentially 

through the time series and fitting exponentials to three points at a time. Hence, each 

voltage  decay  time  series  of  ten  data  points  yielded  eight  spectral  points.  The  flow 

was calculated using the five-minute averages of measured wind speed and direction, 

with the actual flow within the tube derived as described in Section 3.2.1. The critical 

mobility  was  calculated  from  Eq.  8.6,  using  the  five-minute  average  flow  and  the 

central  voltage  of  the  three  points.  The  voltage  across  the  Gerdien  electrodes  at  the 

start of the decay was (cid:150)22.3 V. 

The  filtering  criteria  described  at  the  end  of  Chapter  7  were  applied  to  each  three-
point data set. After these filtering criteria had been applied, n(¬µ) was calculated from 

Eq. 8.2. The mobilities varied depending on the wind speed at the time of the decay, 

so  they  were  averaged  over  the  same  seven-hour  period  as  well  as  the  ion 

concentrations. Uncertainties in the ion concentrations and the average mobility were 

calculated from the standard error of the means of both quantities. 

 

  

8.3.3  Comparison of ion spectra obtained by the two techniques 
Negative  ion  mobility  spectra  calculated  by  the  two  methods  described  in  Sections 

8.3.1 and 8.3.2, are shown in Figure 8.5 below.

voltage  measurements  for  1000-1700  18th  June  2000,  at  Reading  University 

Meteorology Field Site. Error bars are the standard error of the mean. 

The  spectra  from  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  are  in  a  smaller  mobility  range  because 

only a 2.5 V change in voltage at the central electrode can be measured. Additionally, 

the  sampling  only  lasts  for  5 s  (for  reasons  discussed  in  Chapter  5.7.3),  so  only  a 

fraction  of  the  complete  decay  is  observed.  In  the  Current  Measurement  mode,  the 

lower  mobility  limit  is  controlled  by  the  bias  voltage  supply,  and  the  minimum 
mobility  that  can  be  measured  ‚âà 0.27 cm2V-1s-1.  The  spectra  are  derived  from 

differencing  10 s  averages  from  two  instruments  separated  by  up  to  2  minutes, 

whereas  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  the  spectrum  is  an  average  of  instantaneous 

measurements  from  one  instrument  in  1.5 s.    The  assumption  that  the  ion  spectrum 

remains  constant  over  the  duration  of  the  measurement  may  be  more  difficult  to 

maintain  for  the  current  mode  measurements.  However,  this  is  a  more  established 

technique  for  mobility  spectra  calculation  (Phillips  et  al,  1955;  Misaki,  1964; 

Dhanorkar  and  Kamra,  1993;  Knudsen  and  Israelsson,  1994).  As  such,  the 

approximate agreement with this spectrum calculated from the Voltage Decay method 

is promising.

Conductivity  calculated  with  the  average  mobility  derived  from  the  spectrum  is  0.6 
‚Äì 0.1 fSm-1, which is much lower than expected in urban areas - although it is difficult 

to define what is (cid:147)expected(cid:148) given the plethora of assumptions associated with most 

conductivity  measurements.  If  conductivity  is  calculated  using  a  typical  value  of 
mobility,  1.7  cm2V-1s-1,  it  is  2 ‚Äì 0.3 fSm-1,  which  is  believable  for  urban  areas.  It  is 

not appropriate to compare conductivity calculated from the PIMS mobility spectrum 

with  other  PIMS  conductivity  measurements,  because  the  PIMS  conductivity 

measurements  discussed  previously  were  calculated  assuming  the  ion  spectrum  was 

unimodal.

Although  there  is  arguably  insufficient  data  to  fit  a  curve  to  the  results  shown  in 

Figure 8.5, a Gaussian spectrum was fitted to this data to enable comparisons with the 

measured  Estonian  spectrum.  Integrating the area under this Gaussian curve showed 
that the total number of ions is 102 ‚Äì 16 cm-3, which is a typical value for urban areas 

(Chalmers,  1967).  The  Estonian  ion  spectrum  was  measured  in  a  rural  area,  where 

fewer ions are lost by attachment to aerosol, so N would be expected to be larger than

in the air of urban Reading. The spectrum calculated here has an average mobility71 of 
about  0.5 cm2V-1s-1,  which  is  at  least  a  factor  of  two  too low for negative ions (e.g. 

Mohnen,  1974;  Hƒ±rrak  et  al,  2000).  It  is  not  clear  why  this  is,  because  even  at  the 

edges  of  the  (substantial)  error  bars  the  mean  mobility  would  only  shift  by  about 
0.2 cm2V-1s-1.  The  ion  spectrum  measured  at  Reading  covers  a  relatively  small 

mobility  range;  the  small  ion  spectrum  of  Hƒ±rrak  et  al  (2000)  covered  the  mobility 
range  0.3  to  3  cm2V-1s-1.  The  Gaussian  spectrum  assumed  here  is  for  comparison 

purposes only, there is currently no scientific theory predicting any particular form for 

the  atmospheric  small  ion  spectrum,  and  it  may  be  an  inappropriate  fit  to  this  data. 

However it is known to be approximately correct, and has a small number (3) of free 

parameters. 

  

The  piecewise  inversion  of  Voltage  Decay  measurements  and  the  differencing 

technique  for  Current  Mode  measurements  have  been  used  to  calculate  two  average 

negative  ion  spectra  in  different  mobility  ranges  for  a  fair  weather  day  at  Reading. 

Spectra from the two techniques agree approximately in the calculated mobility range. 

This shows that the piecewise inversion technique is successful in comparison with a 

more  well-established  method  to  calculate  ion  mobility  spectra.  The  mean  mobility 

from  the  Reading  spectrum  is  too  low,  which  probably  results  from  measuring  a 

narrower (and smaller in magnitude) range of mobilities than the Estonian reference 

spectrum.  A  Gaussian  fit  to  the  Reading  spectrum  calculates  a  typical  value  for  the 

total number of ions, which is less than the number calculated in the clean air of rural 

Estonia, in accordance with ion-aerosol theory.  

 

8.4  Relationship between ions and aerosol in Reading air 

On 25th February 2000, negative conductivity measurements were made with PIMS 1 

at  Reading  University  Meteorology  Field  Site,  at  the  same  time  as  Condensation 

Nucleus (CN) observations made manually every two minutes with a Pollak counter 

(Pedder, 1971). The Pollak counter measures all particles of r > 3 nm to 5 % accuracy 

when  operated  at  an  overpressure  of  160 mm Hg  (Metnieks  and  Pollak,  1969).  This 

day  had  the  longest  time  series  of  coincident  conductivity  and  aerosol  number 

concentration (Z) measurements available. Measurements of ions made with the PIMS 

                                                           
71 In ion mobility spectrum parlance, the (cid:147)average(cid:148) mobility is the most frequently occurring value (i.e.

will be compared to the predictions of classical ion-aerosol theory, in the light of the 

uncertainties discussed in Chapter 7.

Eq. 8.10. 

Because  ions  attach  to  aerosol,  when  the  aerosol  concentration  increases,  the  ion 

concentration decreases, and this has led to the concept of using air conductivity as an 

urban air pollution indicator (again, this has been discussed in Section 2.4). However, 
the  magnitude  of  the  effect  is  variable.  The  ion-aerosol  attachment  coefficient  Œ≤  is 

size-dependent  (Gunn,  1954).  To  get  an  estimate  of  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  to 
look for on the 25th February, Eq. 8.10. has been plotted in Figure 8.6 below for three 

typical  aerosol  radii,  in  each  case  assuming  a  monodisperse  aerosol  population with 
particles  of  constant  density  of  1.77 x 103  kgm-3.  Attachment  coefficients  were 
calculated  using  the  relationships  of  Gunn  (1954).  The  mean  Z,  for  25th  February 

(which  was  very  well-defined  on  this  day  as  can  be  seen  from  Figure  8.7),  has  also 

been indicated on Figure 8.6. It can be seen that whatever the mean aerosol radius, the 

curve  is  becoming  asymptotic,  and  the  conductivity  is  insensitive  to  changes  in  the 

aerosol  concentration.  There  is  therefore  unlikely  to  be  a  detectable  inverse 

relationship  between  conductivity  and  aerosol  concentration  at  these  aerosol 

concentrations.

positive  correlation  between  the  ion  and  CN  concentrations,  and  for  other  periods 

there is an anticorrelation, as conventional theory suggests. These have been indicated 

with arrows in Figure 8.7 below.

The  changes  in  r√ògime  in  Figure  8.7  could  be  caused  by  varying  radii  of  ion 

contributing to the measurement; according to classical ion-aerosol theory, only small 

ions should be inversely related to the aerosol concentration. If intermediate ions are 

being measured by the PIMS, due to low wind speeds decreasing the critical mobility, 

then there may be some overlap between the measuring ranges of the Pollak counter 

and  the  PIMS.  Accordingly  rmax  was  calculated  for  the  periods  of  correlation  and 

anticorrelation, but there was no difference in the mean radius of ion being measured 

for the different conditions. This can be seen in Figure 8.8, where the time series of 

rmax is not related to the ion concentration, or its relationship with Z in Figure 8.7.

For  25th  February,  the  mean  aerosol  concentration  was  8300  cm-3,  and  the  negative 
ion concentration was about 800 cm-3 (assuming a unimodal spectrum). Given that air 

ions  only  carry  a  single  charge,  it  is  probable  that  at  these  CN  concentrations,  the 

space charge was dominated by the particulate fraction. On this day, the space charge 

was negative for the whole measurement period; negative space charge is commonly 

caused by charged particulates (Crozier, 1964; Knudsen and Israelsson, 1994; Kamra, 

1992).  The  combination  of  a  high  mean  CN  concentration  and  problems  with 

applying classical ion-aerosol theory, again suggest that particulate space charge may

is  insignificant  compared  with  the  effect  of  larger  particulates  (which  are  not  being 

influenced  by  electrical  forces)  contributing  to  the  conductivity  measurement.  The

extent that in a scatter plot of œÉ against Z (Figure 8.9 below), there is a weak positive 

correlation (with coefficient 0.1) between œÉ and Z.

According to the theoretically predicted relationship (Figure 8.6) between œÉ and Z, œÉ 

becimes insensitive to changes in Z at high Z. Z is also remarkably smooth for ~ 60 % 

of the time series, so its fluctuations are small and are even less likely to be reflected 

in the conductivity.

Dhanorkar and Kamra (1997) predicted that conventional ion-aerosol theory does not 
apply  at  typical  urban  aerosol  concentrations  of  about  104 (cid:150) 106 cm-3,  because 

intermediate  and  large  ions  contribute  to  the  conductivity.  The  measurements  at 

Reading  suggest  there  was  a  large  proportion  of  particulate  space  charge,  (with 
aerosol  concentrations  ~ 104  cm-3)  on  25th  February,  which  can mechanically impact 

on  the  Gerdien  electrodes  and  perturb  the  conductivity  measurement  (as  shown  in 

Section 7.4). These results therefore appear to verify the hypothesis of Dhanorkar and 

Kamra (1997), and show experimentally that particulate space charge can contribute 

to the conductivity measurement and invalidate conventional theory.  

8.5  Conclusions 

The major result presented in this chapter is a new method to calculate ion mobility 

spectra based on the Voltage Decay mode results. It has been derived from modifying 

the classical theory of conductivity calculation from exponential decay of charge from 

a  capacitor  through  air.  It  reproduces  the  classical  predictions  when  there  is  a 

unimodal  ion  mobility  spectrum,  on  which  assumption  the  classical  theory  is  based. 

The new technique was then applied to calculate an average spectrum for seven hours 

of  data,  and  spectra  were  also  calculated  for  the  same  period  by  a  better-known 

technique  from  the  Current  Measurement  mode.  Results  from  the  two  methods  are 

difficult to compare directly, for reasons outlined in Section 8.3.3, but they are in near 

agreement in magnitude. Their combined results produce a realistic value for the total 

ion  concentration  when  a  reference  spectrum  is  fitted  and  compared  to  a  long-term 

average spectrum. There is some offset in the mean mobility, which may result from 

fitting the spectrum to a narrower mobility range than the Estonian average spectrum. 

The  steady-state  solution  of  the  ion  balance  equation  (Eq.  2.19)  suggests  that  the 

response  of  the  small  ion  population  to  higher aerosol concentrations is slight.  Ion, 
CN and space charge measurements on 25th February 2000 have shown that this small 

variation  is  submerged  by  the  effects  of  particulate  space  charge  contributing  to  the 

measurement. This shows that classical ion-aerosol theory may not be appropriate at 

typical  urban  aerosol  concentrations,  and  validates  the  theoretical  predictions  of 

Dhanorkar and Kamra (1997).

9  Conclusions 

 
Cosmopolitan(cid:146)s  authority  on  the  physical  nature  of  the  world  is  readily  challenged, 

but  the  quotation  serves  to  illustrate  the  confusion  surrounding  the  significance  of 

atmospheric  ions.  The  statement  is  of  course  risible  to  anyone  who  has  some 

knowledge of the science of atmospheric ions and aerosol. Yet it has become clear in 

this  Thesis  that  in  some  circumstances,  measurements  of  atmospheric  ions  are 

significantly  affected  by  the  presence  of  aerosol  particles.  In  this  context,  the 

Cosmopolitan  quotation  appears  more  relevant,  for  aerosol  particles  can  certainly 

cause a spurious (cid:147)ion(cid:148) signal in a Gerdien condenser. 

9.1  An instrument to measure atmospheric ions 

There is a long tradition of atmospheric ion measurements in the last century‚Äôs history 

of  physics.  Many  of  these  measurements  have  been  made  with  a  simple  instrument, 

the  Gerdien  condenser  (Gerdien,  1905),  or  related  variants.  Atmospheric  ion 

measurements  are  again  increasingly  relevant  to  modern  atmospheric  science  due  to 

the  general  interest  in  aerosols  with  regard  to  climate  and  pollution  issues,  and  the 

possibility that ions are involved in aerosol particle formation. However, the Gerdien 

condenser  has  undergone  surprisingly  little  development,  and  issues  such  as  its 

absolute  calibration  have  not  been  satisfactorily  answered  in  the  history  of  the 

instrument, with working approximations employed.  

Previous measurements of air ions with the Gerdien condenser have been made under 

a variety of instrumental operating conditions, and it is probably for this reason that 

they have not yielded conclusive results when compared to each other and to classical 

ion-aerosol 

theory.  Ion  mobility  spectrum  measurements  made  with  similar 

instruments  are  highly  necessary  for  the  understanding  of  air  ions,  since  mobility 

spectra  can  resolve  ionic  growth  processes.  Ion  mobility  spectra may also be one of 

the necessary tools to determine if ions are implicated in ultrafine particle formation.

Conclusions 

A miniaturised Gerdien condenser has been designed, in an attempt to avoid many of 

the inlet errors associated with previous instruments. It has been used to measure air 

conductivity  at  different  mobilities  in  two  measurement  modes.  The  Current 

Measurement mode measures an ionic current directly, and the Voltage Decay mode 

determines  the  conductivity  from  change  in  voltage  across  the  condenser,  as  ions 

exchange charge. The device has been developed into a Programmable Ion Mobility 

Spectrometer,  (PIMS)  which  seems  unique  in  that  it can self-calibrate by measuring 

ions in both modes. Three of these spectrometers have been constructed and tested in 

atmospheric  air  for  self-consistency,  and  against  independent  ion  measurements. 

During  the  development  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrometer,  issues  have  arisen  which 

produce  uncertainty  in  its  results  and  preclude  certain  operating  conditions.  These 

findings  are  general  ones,  which  can  be  applied  to  all  aspiration  ion  measurement

The  ion  spectrometer  described  in  this  Thesis  is  based  on  the  classical  Gerdien 

condenser, but differs from previous instruments in its mechanical construction. It is 

considerably smaller and incorporates a third electrode to provide electrical screening. 

Aluminium  was  found  unsatisfactory  as  a  tube  material,  and  stainless  steel  is 

preferred.  It  is  designed  to  be  easily  dismantled  for  cleaning  and  repair.  Its 

capacitance  has  been  calibrated  to  1  %,  which  considerably  reduces  the  sources  of 

uncertainty in conductivity measurement. The ion spectrometer is deployed in situ, to 

avoid  inlet  errors,  and  natural  ventilation  is  fan-assisted  to  prevent  saturation.  The 

flow properties inside the tube as a function of the natural ventilation were measured 

in a wind tunnel and were non-linear. This suggests that using the external ventilation 

rate  alone  to  calculate  critical  mobilities  in  a  fan-assisted  tube,  as  has  been  widely 

adopted in the past, is inaccurate.  

Ions are detected with a multimode electrometer which uses reed relays to switch its 

functionality  between  that  of  a  current  amplifier  and  voltage  follower,  so  one 

electrometer  can  be  used  to  measure  the  signals  generated  in  both  measurement 

modes.  The  multimode  electrometer  also  includes  two  self-checking  modes  so  that

temperature-dependent offsets, such as the op-amp input bias current and electrometer 

leakage currents can be compensated using software. 

The  approach  of using the same ion spectrometer in the Voltage Decay and Current 

Measurement  modes  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  sound,  since  results  from the two 

modes  agree.  These  are  thought  to  be  the  first  measurements  using  both  Gerdien 

measurement modes with one sampling instrument. Comparison of the two modes of 

the three ion spectrometers constructed was also successful. The three spectrometers 

have  been  tested  in  atmospheric  air  against  independent  instruments;  a  Geiger 

counter,  which  measures  the  ion  production  rate,  and  another,  reference,  Gerdien 

condenser. In clean air, the ion concentration is associated with the square root of the 

Geiger  count  rate,  according  to  theory.  In  the  polluted  air of urban Reading a direct 

relationship between the Geiger count rate and the ion concentration cannot be seen 

due  to  the  complicating effects of aerosol, but the ion spectrometer still responds to 

peaks  in  the  Geiger  count  rate.    The  trends  in  conductivity  measured  by  the  ion 

spectrometer  and  the  more  classically  designed  Gerdien  reference  condenser  track 

each  other  well,  but  direct  comparisons  are  difficult  owing  to  the  differing  sizes  of 

Gerdien  tube.  Average  conductivities  from  both  modes  have  been  calculated  from 

measurements  made  at  Reading  on  24  fair  weather  days  in  April-June  2000,  which 

reproduce  the  diurnal  variation  seen  in  the  literature.  This  is  thought  to  be  the  first 

systematic set of conductivity measurements using the Voltage Decay method in the 

atmospheric surface layer. 

 

 

The  new,  smaller  design  of  Gerdien  condenser  is  advantageous  because  of  its 

portability  and  ease  of  use  in  the  field.  For,  example  operating  several  such  ion 

spectrometers  in  an  array  would  be  relatively  straightforward.  The  third  screening 

electrode  reduces  the  effect  of  electromagnetic  interference  on  the  measurements, 

allowing  the  outer  electrode  to  be  operated  above  ground  potential.  The  smaller 

design of the Gerdien is advantageous because it requires smaller bias voltages, which 

can  be  more  precisely  controlled  for  increased  accuracy  in  critical  mobility 

determination.  Constructing  the  ion  spectrometer  so  it  can  be  easily  dismantled  for 

cleaning  and  repair  is  certainly  a  worthwhile  effort,  as  all  measurements  requiring 

high  integrity  insulation  deteriorate  in  atmospheric  conditions.  The  multimode

Conclusions 

electrometer design has enabled the self-calibration hypothesis to be pursued, and its 

ability to measure voltage offsets and current leakages has improved the accuracy of 

the  ion  measurements.  Results  from  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  are  noisier  than  those 

from  the  Current  Measurement  mode,  perhaps  resulting  from  the  effect  of  highly-

charged  aerosol  particles  reaching  the  electrodes.  The  increased  confidence  in  the 

instrument achieved by making measurements in both modes certainly outweighs the 

heavy  filtering  which  is  sometimes  required  for  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  data.  In 

practice,  the  Current  Measurement  mode  will  probably  be  preferred,  with  Voltage 

Decay samples also taken to check the measurement. 

  

 

9.3  Experimental findings from the ion spectrometer 

9.3.1  Ventilation-modulated ion size selection 
Varying  the  flow  in  the  Gerdien  tube  modifies  the  critical  mobility,  which  is  the 

minimum  mobility  of  ion  contributing  to  the  conductivity  measurement.  Mobility  is 

inversely  related to ion radius, (the relationship can be expressed in simplified form 

by  a  power  law)  so  the  concept  of  critical  mobility  can  be  equated  to  a  maximum 

radius  of  ion  which  can  be  detected  by  the  spectrometer.    If  the  flow  is  sufficiently 

low,  intermediate  ions  can  contribute  directly  to  the  measurement  of  conductivity. 

This  is  undesirable  because  it  invalidates  the  classical  indirect  theory  of  ion-aerosol 

interactions. It was found that the flow in the tube can sometimes become low enough 

for intermediate ions to be measured at low external ventilation rates, even when the 

tube is ventilated by a fan. Atmospheric turbulence causes considerable fluctuations in 

the  wind  speed  and  direction  on  short  timescales.  This  can  frequently  bring  the  ion 

spectrometer into the intermediate ion measurement range. 

This  can  be  alleviated  by  measuring  the  external  wind  velocity  near  to  the  ion 

spectrometer, and rejecting the data for the periods when the maximum radius of ion 

measured is in the intermediate range. This consideration is relevant for any Gerdien 

measurements where the external ventilation influences the flow rate in the tube. The 

nature  of  the  flow  cannot  be  confirmed  until  measurements  of  the  flow  in  the  tube 

have been made under controlled conditions e.g. in a wind tunnel. In the absence of 

such  measurements,  any  previous  measurements  where  the  fan  flow  rate  is 

comparable  to  the  external  wind  velocity  must  be treated with caution. Experiments

Conclusions 

where  the  instrument  was  purely  ventilated  by  the  wind  will  almost  certainly  have 

been  influenced  by  this  effect,  for  example  Gringel  (1978)  and  Knudsen  and 

Israelsson  (1994).  Some  re-analysis  of  existing  measurements,  if  wind  data  is 

available, may be necessary; if adjacent wind measurements were not made, then the 

data may be suspect. 

9.3.2  The effect of space charge 
The  sum  of  the  charges  per  unit  volume  of  electrically  charged  particles  in  the  air 

(both  ionic  and  particulate)  comprises  the  atmospheric  space  charge.  Experiments 

performed  with  the  ion  spectrometer  have  shown  that a significant non-ionic charge 

can be detected as well as the ionic contribution. The results suggest that particulate 

space charge can directly contribute to the conductivity when it is advected onto the 

spectrometer electrodes. However, on other days, only ionic space charge contributes 

to the conductivity measurement. 

Two r√ògimes have therefore been identified, which it is important to differentiate for 

the  following  reason.  When  particulate  space charge contributes to the conductivity, 

charged  aerosol  particles  are  measured  by  the  spectrometer  as  well  as  small  ions. 

Classical ion-aerosol theory predicts an inverse relationship between conductivity and 

aerosol  number  concentration,  which  when  aerosol  particles  are  included  in  the 

conductivity  measurement,  will  be  invalidated.  The  particulate  space  charge  can 

occasionally  dominate  the ionic signal, invalidating the measurement. The small ion 

measurement case, of principally ionic space charge, represents the conditions under 

which ion-aerosol theory should apply. 

In  the  r√ògime  when  particulate  space  charge  contributes  to  the  conductivity,  ion-

aerosol  theory  will  not  apply,  because  the  direct  effect  of  aerosol  on  conductivity 

overrides the inverse relationship predicted by theory. The effect is exacerbated by the 

insensitivity  of  the  conductivity  to  changes  in  the  aerosol  concentration  at  high 

aerosol  concentrations.  This 

is  experimental  confirmation  of 

the 

theoretical 

predictions  made  by  Dhanorkar  and  Kamra  (1997),  of  the  failure  of  the  inverse 

conductivity-aerosol relationship at high aerosol concentrations.

Conclusions 

9.3.3  Validity of air conductivity as a pollution indicator 
Practical  implications  of  the  corroboration  of  Dhanorkar  and  Kamra‚Äôs  (1997) 

predictions are that it is clearly unfeasible to use conductivity as an urban air pollution 

indicator, except in relatively clean air, with a low aerosol concentration. Even if the 

contribution  of  particulate  space  charge  to  the  conductivity  measurement  is 

particularly large with the small instrument used in this Thesis (although there is no 

scientific  reason  to  suppose  it  might  be),  the  insensitivity  of  the  conductivity  to 

aerosol  at  high  aerosol  conditions  implies  that  the  combination  of  these  two  factors 

still  synergise  in  invalidating  the  inverse  relationship.  This may help to explain the 

large scatter in attempts to observe an inverse conductivity-aerosol relationship (Guo 

et al, 1996). The direct use of space charge, rather than ions, as a pollution indicator 

may therefore be more appropriate in urban air. 

 

The utility of using conductivity to infer local aerosol concentrations in clean air may 

be  doubtful,  but  clean-air  conductivity  measurements  could  perhaps  still  be  used  to 

infer  a  global  change  in  aerosol  levels.  The  existence  of  this  secular  effect  is  still 

unresolved despite oceanic conductivity measurements adding a new point to the plot 

of  conductivity  against  time  every  few  years  (the  most  recent  being  Kamra  and 

Deshpande  (1995)).  However,  meteorological  effects  and  to  a  lesser  extent  ion 

variations  may  cause  local  variability.  Variations  in  the  operating  conditions  of  the 

Gerdien,  for  example  the  different  critical  mobilities,  may  also  cause  differences 

between  the  conductivity  measurements.  If  clean-air  conductivity  measurements  are 

to  have  any  chance  of  observing  secular  changes,  there  need  to  be  several  standard 

instruments recording conductivity at different clean air locations for some time (e.g. 

several  months  every  five  years),  so  that  changes  in  the  long-term  average  can  be 

detected.  

 
9.4  The importance of the ion mobility spectrum 

The  existence  of  a  spectrum  of  atmospheric  small  ions  has  been  known  for  many 

years,  e.g.  Torreson  (1949).  However,  the  effect  of  the  spectrum  has  usually  been 

ignored  in  conductivity  measurements;  the  derivation  of  conductivity  from  Voltage 

Decay  measurements  assumes  a  unimodal  spectrum,  so  that  charge  on  an  electrode 

decays exponentially at a rate dependent on the air conductivity. This approximation 

is  probably  a  consequence  of  the  history  of  electrometry:  in  the  early  years  of  ion 

Chapter 9

Conclusions 

measurements  the  only  form  of  electrometer  available  was  a  gold-leaf  electroscope 

(e.g. Zeleny, 1898). This could only be used to determine an overall rate of decay, and 

could  not  make  discrete  measurements  of  the  change  of  voltage.  A  theoretical 

background  to  support  ion  measurements  was  being  developed  concurrently,  and 

assumed a unimodal ion spectrum because the instruments to measure an ion mobility 

spectrum did not yet exist. Even when the existence of the ion spectrum became well-

known, the unimodal theory developed in the early 1900s has been glibly repeated to 

the present day, with no modification arising from the improved observations of the 

ion  mobility  spectrum.  The  theory  clearly  needs  to account for a mobility spectrum, 

which, in general, will cause a departure from an exponential decay. 

 

 

In  this  Thesis,  the  consequences  of  considering  the  ion  mobility  spectrum  in 

conductivity  measurement  have  been  investigated.  The  exponential  relationship  for 

the rate of decay of charge from the Gerdien electrodes through air assumes there is a 

unimodal  ion  mobility  spectrum.  Several  sets  of  measurements  have  shown  that  the 

mean spectrum is clearly not unimodal (Torreson, 1949; Misaki, 1964; Hƒ±rrak et al, 

2000), and in this case there is a quasi-exponential decay, because the voltage change 

during the decay affects the critical mobility of the measurement.  

The concept of a change in voltage varying the critical mobility of the measurement is 

a  simple  one,  and  clear  from  use  of  the  Current  Mode.  Swann  (1914)  described  the 

Gerdien condenser as an instrument which is designed to be run in the Voltage Decay 

mode,  but  recent  publications  do  not  refer  to  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  as  an 

alternative  means  of  conductivity  measurement  at  all  (e.g.  MacGorman  and  Rust, 

1998).  Only  three  papers  seem  to  have  been  published  using  the  Voltage  Decay 

technique  in  the  last  fifty  years  (Venkiteshwaran,  1958;  Hatakayema  et  al,  1958; 

Rosen  et  al,  1982),  and  all  of  these  described  voltage  decay  measurements  on 

radiosonde-borne  Gerdiens,  which  was  presumably  for  simplicity.  There  do  not 

appear to be any systematic conductivity measurements by the Voltage Decay method 

in the boundary layer. Another, related, explanation is because only measurements in 

clean  air,  out  of  the  boundary  layer,  appear  to  have  been  made.  This  is  virtually 

devoid of the trace gases that react to produce different atmospheric ion species. The 

free tropospheric ion spectrum might therefore be much more unimodal in nature than 

Chapter 9 

 

221 

Conclusions 

in the surface layer. Voltage Decay measurements in the upper troposphere might be 

expected  to  conform  to  more  ideal  exponentials  than  have  been  observed  in  the 

surface layer. Venkiteshwaran (1958) shows some sample voltage decay traces, which 

are ideal exponential decays, supporting this suggestion. 

9.4.1  Derivation of the quasi-exponential decay 
An  expression  has  been  derived  for  the  form  of  the  decay  when  there  is  a  non-

unimodal spectrum. This is similar to the traditional exponential decay, except that it 

includes an integral to include the effect of the changing voltage on the mobilities of 

ions being measured. The equation is no longer amenable to analytical solution, and 

requires numerical techniques to yield a quasi-exponential voltage decay curve from a 

prescribed ion spectrum. 

9.4.2  Calculating the ion mobility spectrum from Voltage Decay measurements 
A further technique was developed to obtain a spectrum by piecewise inversion, from 

the Voltage Decay mode time series. This involves approximating small steps of the 

voltage  decay  time  series  with  exponential  decays.  The  technique  was  applied  to  a 

theoretically  derived  voltage  decay  time  series  generated  from  a  Gaussian  ion 

spectrum,  and  successfully  inverted  the  voltage  decay  series  to  recover  the  original 

Gaussian spectrum. It was then applied to a set of voltage decay measurements made 

with the ion spectrometer to obtain a spectrum is a novel technique, although over a 

restricted range. Nolan (1920) classified ion categories from the (cid:147)quasi-linear(cid:148) Ohmic 

response  resulting  from  the  existence  of  the  mobility  spectrum,  which  is  a  similar 

conceptualisation to the quasi-exponential decay. However, the ion spectrum does not 

appear to have been calculated from Voltage Decay measurements before.  

9.4.3  Programmable capabilities of the spectrometer 
The  ion  mobility  spectrometer  developed  is  fully  programmable;  it  is  operated  by  a 

microcontroller,  which  can  be  programmed  in  a  variant  of  BASIC  from  a  PC.  This 

enables it to be run as a spectrometer in the Current Mode by varying the bias voltage, 

so that the mobility of ions contributing to the measurement can be changed.

Conclusions 

Conductivity measurements from two adjacent PIMS instruments running at different 

bias  voltages  in  the  Current  Mode  have  been  used  to  calculate  ion  spectra.  The 

calculated  ion  concentrations  and  mobilities  were  similar  to  those  obtained  for  the 

same day from the Voltage Decay mode, reinforcing the technique used to calculate 

the spectrum from piecewise inversion. The Current Mode ion spectrum agreed with a 

reference spectrum obtained from long-term ion measurements. 

 

 

 

9.4.4  Relevance of the ion mobility spectrum to conductivity measurements 
The  ion  mobility  spectrum  is  highly  relevant  to  conductivity  measurement  for  two 

main  reasons.  The  first  reason  is  the  calculation  of  conductivity  from  the  Voltage 

Decay  mode.  The  exponential  model  is  inappropriate,  except  when  the  mobility 

spectrum  is  unimodal.  The  most  accurate  way  to  calculate  conductivity  from  the 

Voltage  Decay  mode  would  be  to  calculate  the  spectrum  for  the  mobilities  scanned 

through  by  the  voltage  decay.  When  this  is  known,  the  total  number  of  ions  can  be 

found and used to calculate the conductivity within that mobility range. 

Conductivity  calculated  from  discrete  measurements  in  both  modes  is  clearly 

dependent  on  the  fraction  of  the  mobility spectrum contributing to the measurement 

(i.e.  the  instantaneous  flow  rate  and  bias  voltage).  Ideally  therefore,  conductivity 

should be an integrated measure of the ion number concentration, calculated from the 

total number of ions in the mobility spectrum. This requires parallel measurements of 

conductivity and ion spectra, which the PIMS is able to provide. In the absence of an 

ion  mobility  spectrometer,  the  critical  mobility  at  which  the  measurement  is  made 

should  be  quoted,  with  some  indication  of  its  variability,  since  it is inappropriate to 

compare  conductivity 

  measurements  directly  if  their  critical  mobilities  are 

significantly different. 

9.5  Atmospheric measurements 

The  PIMS  instrument  was  designed  to  make  fair  weather  measurements  of 

conductivity  and  ion  spectra  in  the  surface  layer.  It  is  fundamentally  unsuited  to 

measuring in precipitation, as are Gerdien devices in general, because water inside the 

tube  disturbs  the  measurement.  Perhaps  surprisingly,  conductivity  has  not  been 

reported  to  vary  very  much    from  fair  weather  conditions  in  the  vicinity  of  a 

Chapter 9 

 

223 

Conclusions 

thunderstorm  (Blakeslee  and  Krider,  1992;  Bailey  et  al,  1999).  The  PIMS  could 

therefore  be  deployed  in  disturbed  weather,  providing  it  was  protected  from 

precipitation.  However,  addition  of  circuitry  to  protect  the  control  system  from 

transients would be advisable. 

In considering whether the PIMS would be suitable for measurements at altitude, it is 

necessary to consider whether the electrometer can measure the higher conductivities 

due  to  increased  ionisation  by  cosmic  rays.  In  the  Current  Mode  the  multimode 
electrometer  can  measure  conductivities  up  to  100 fSm-1,  and  the  maximum 
conductivity  measurable  in  the  Voltage  Decay  mode  is  200 fSm-1.  Conductivity 

reaches these levels at about 10 km (Woessner et al 1958; Gringel, 1978) so the PIMS 

in  its  present  form  would  be  able  to  measure  up  to  about  this  height,  needing  little 

modification  to  be  flown  on  an  aeroplane.  As  it  is,  the  PIMS  is  too  heavy  to  be 

suitable  for  radiosonde  or  gondola  ascents,  and  it  was  designed  specifically  to  send 

data  serially  to  a  nearby  PC.  The  idea  of  a  microcontrolled  spectrometer  with 

specially-designed circuitry and power supplies would be a novel one, and might be 

able to obtain the first ion spectra out of the surface layer.  

9.6  Further work 

Further  research  is  needed  into  the  effect  of  space  charge  onto  the  conductivity 

measurements.  To  predict  the  occurrence  of  the  r√ògime  dominated  by  particulate 

space charge described in Section 9.3.2, the space charge needs to be partitioned into 

ionic  and  particulate  components.  This  is  a  further  motivation  for  study  of  the 

turbulent  transport  of  space  charge,  begun  by  Barlow  (2000).  A  measurement 

campaign  comprising  ion  and  aerosol  number  concentration,  ion  production  rate, 

meteorological  and  space  charge  measurements  in  clean  and  polluted  air  should 

provide insight into the conditions in which the PIMS instrument can and cannot be 

known  to  respond  solely  to  small  ions.  Bipolar  ion  measurements  near  the  ground 

would facilitate investigations of the electrode effect, and such a campaign might also 

supply more details about the efficacy of space charge as an urban pollution indicator.  

There is a need for more ion mobility spectra, particularly at high time resolution, to 

investigate  the  properties  of  the  spectrum  in  general,  and  to  attempt  to  resolve  ion

Conclusions 

nucleation  processes.  Shifts  in the spectrum towards larger ions have been observed 

on  timescales  of  order  half  a  day  (Hƒ±rrak  et  al,  1998a).  Ions have been observed to 

form  particles  at  high  radioactivity, there is strong laboratory evidence that particles 

can  be  formed  from  ions  at  natural  levels  of  radiation  (Vohra  et  al,  1984)  and 

modelling studies have predicted that particles are formed from ion-ion recombination 

(Turco et al, 1998; Yu and Turco, 2000). However there are no direct observations of 

ion  growth  leading  to  ultrafine  particles  in  the  atmosphere.  To  resolve  this,  ion 

mobility  spectra  associated  with  ultrafine  particle  measurements  would  be  required. 

The  Voltage  Decay  mode  of  the  PIMS  is  clearly  capable  of  resolving  high  time 

resolution  mobility  spectra:  1  spectrum  every  5 s,  or  more.  The  programmable 

capability  of  the  PIMS  also  allows  voltages  to  be  selected  over  a  wider  range  of 

interest, to calculate spectra from the Current Measurement mode.  

 

 

The piecewise inversion technique could readily be applied to simple Voltage Decay 

Gerdien  measurements  made  on  radiosondes,  to  investigate  the  ion  spectrum  in  the 

free troposphere. These new measurements would provide similar information about 

the  ion  population  and  particle  formation  as  described  above,  but  applied  to  the 

troposphere  where  cloud  formation  occurs.  They  would  perhaps  give  some  more 

direct atmospheric answers to the microphysical questions raised in the controversial 

debate over cosmic ray ionisation and cloud formation.  

Some  improvements  to  the  instrumentation  developed  in  this  Thesis  would  help  to 

achieve  these  aims.  Sensing  the  wind  speed  within  the  tube,  and  electronically 

modifying  the  bias  voltage  so  that  it  remains  constant,  thus  smoothing  the  effect  of 

wind fluctuations is the most obvious next step. Measurements with an array of PIMS 

would  be  useful  in  determining  local  variability  in  ion  concentrations.  Installing  a 

more  powerful  microcontroller  (these  are  readily  available)  would  permit  further 

sophistication in automation of the measurements. Synchronisation could be improved 

by  addition  of  further  timing  circuitry,  which  is  commercially  obtainable.  The 

microcontroller could be used to sense a mobility range of interest, for example where 

the spectrum is changing most rapidly. The bias voltage could then be automatically 

changed  to concentrate on measuring in the desired mobility range. Additionally, an

be desirable to improve the fraction of data retained from the PIMS in fair weather.

Electrometer  Current  Amplifiers  allow  the  measurement  of  ultra-small  currents, 

which are typically in the range 10 fA to 10 pA for atmospheric ion measurements. A 

feedback  current  amplifier  uses  a  low  input-bias  current  opamp  as  the  amplifying 
element, with negative feedback applied using a large (~G‚Ñ¶ to T‚Ñ¶) resistor. This is 

frequently called a transresistance configuration: it is a current-to-voltage converter. 

The high-value resistor is usually only of a nominal value, and therefore a calibration 

is required for precise measurement of current to be obtained. 

Calibration  requires  either  a  known  source  of  small  currents,  or  a  scaling  argument 

based on determining the resistor ratios in bridge circuits using known fixed resistors 

to derive the value of the large, unknown feedback resistor. Systems based on scaling 

techniques  have  already  been  described  (Harrison  1995,  1997a),  and  it  is  the 

calibration based on small current generations which are discussed further here. 

B.1.1 Resistive generation of small currents 

Currents can be generated using a voltage source applied through a series resistor Rcal 

to  the  current  amplifier.  The  feedback  current  amplifier  input  is  a  virtual  earth, 

therefore  the  whole  potential  difference  of  the  voltage  source  is  applied  across  the 

resistor and the current generated can be calculated if the value of the resistor Rcal is 

known. Its resistance will have to be measured by a different method, which usually 

means direct measurement using a high value ohmmeter, or by fabricating the resistor

The circuit configuration will be some variant of a resistive current source generating 

a known current i, a feedback electrometer opamp, and, possibly, a gain stage (as in 

Figure A.1). Calibration essentially requires the determination of Rf, as the response is 

linear  if  leakage  terms  are  not  significant  and  any  voltage  dependence  of  the 

resistance  Rf  is  negligible.  The  current-to-voltage  stage  A1  is  inverting,  so  that  a 

current flowing into the input leads to a negative voltage at the output of the opamp 

A1.  If  there  is  a  subsequent  gain  stage,  it  may  have  an  inverting  or  non-inverting 
response. An stage with an adjustable gain of nominally G ~ ‚àí1 is useful, as it allows 

the  response  of  the  overall  system  to  preserve  the  sign  of  the  input  current,  and  the 

gain  can  be  trimmed  to  give  an  exact  value,  e.g.  of  1V  per  pA,  when  Rf  has  been 

determined by calibration. 

Assuming  an  ideal  system  (all inputs screened, voltages steady, input-bias current ib 

and any additional leakage currents at the input iL), the output voltage will be 

 

 

 

                                                           
72  An  alternative  is  to  construct  a  preliminary  feedback  current  amplifier  using  the  intended  current 
source  resistor  Rcal  as  the  feedback  resistor,  but  working  at  larger  current  range  (¬µA-nA),  for  which 
currents  are  more  easily  generated  with  conventional,  calibrated  components.    This  is  effectively  a 
variation on the scaling method already mentioned.

Eq. B.1, 

where Vos1 is the offset voltage73 of amplifier A1, typically a few millivolts. This term 

is variable and therefore usually unknown: it is subject to thermal and temporal drifts. 

Eq. B.1 shows that it is desirable for Rcal to be at least comparable with, or preferably 

greater than Rf, so that the right hand square bracket term (amplification of A1‚Äôs offset 

voltage)  can  be  neglected.  However  this  is  not  always  possible  given  the  restricted 
74. In that case, an alternative is to

which will only remain constant from one calibration to the next if ib, iL and Vos1 all 

remain  constant.  This  is  only  likely  to  be  the  case  for  short  time  intervals,  using 

exactly  the  same  combination  of  resistors  and  connectors,  or  if  it  is  established  that 
Vos1 is steady and iL << i. 

In  practice,  use  of  such  a  "gradient-only"  calibration  for  atmospheric 

ion 

measurements  will  not  cause  significant  difficulty,  as  the  source  resistance  of  ion 

counters  is  exceedingly  high.  The  ion  counter  can  be  seen  as  a  resistive  voltage 
source, with Rcal >> Rf and therefore no amplification of the A1 offset voltage occurs. 

However  it  is  important  to  realise  that  the  offset  present  in  the  calibration  of  the 
Current Amplifier (if Rcal << Rf ) will not be present in the measurement using the ion 

counter.

B.1.2 Capacitative generation of small currents 

The  need  to  provide  fixed  small  currents  with  which  to  test  Current  Amplifiers  is 

complicated  by  the  variable  offset  terms  in  Eq.  B.1,  due  to  finite  calibration 
resistance.  Any  device  operating  with  Rcal << Rf  will  not  generate  a  well-defined 

response from a Current Amplifier because of the offset term. An alternative method 

of  generating  a  fixed  current  is  capacitative,  applying  a  voltage  which  is  steadily 

changing to a capacitor.

This  method  generates  the  reference  current  by  differentiation,  using  a  precise, 

slowly-varying  linear  ramp  voltage,  presented  to  a  low  value  high-quality  capacitor. 

The current generated i is proportional to the rate of change of voltage V(t), i.e.

if  the  resistive  generation  of  current  is  comparable  with  the  capacitative  generation. 
This  can  be  minimised  using  a  small  ramp  voltage.  With  a  50  mVs-1  ramp  voltage, 

and  10  pF  polystyrene  capacitor  gave  a  steady  current  during  the  ramp,  to  1  fA. 

                                                                                                                                                                      
74  The  maximum  value  of  resistor  generally  available  is  1T‚Ñ¶,  which  will  give a 1V per pA response 
from an electrometer.  If this sensitivity is required, calibration with a significantly larger Rcal resistor 
is not practical. 

Appendix B 

 

233 

Appendix B: Calibration of feedback current amplifiers 
 

Consequently  the  resistive  contribution  to  the  current  is  small,  and  Rcal  due  to  the 
capacitor can therefore be estimated as ‚â•1 P‚Ñ¶. 

 

 

 

 

The properties and stability of the ramp generator become the important requirements 

in  the  capacitive  method,  together  with  any  AC  response  of  the  electrometer  as  the 

source and feedback impedances which are significant. The source impedance at high 
75,  and  therefore  this 

frequencies,  Zcal  however,  will  be  substantially  lower  than  Rcal

approach is most ideally used with a ‚Äôslow‚Äô (low frequency) electrometer to minimise 

any noise gain.  

B.1.3 Practical implementation of capacitative technique 

A voltage ramp generator has been described for this application (Harrison and Aplin, 

2000a),  in  which  the  rising  and  falling  periods  of  the  voltage  ramp  can  be  used  to 

generate  symmetrical  positive  and  negative  calibration  currents,  Figure  B.3.  With  a 

suitable  capacitor  connected,  it  becomes  a  Current  Reference,  readily  arranged  to 

generate ‚Äì 0.5 pA. 

The  reference  current  is  generated  by  differentiation,  using  a  slowly  increasing  and 

decreasing  linear  ramp  voltage,  presented  to  a  low  value  polystyrene  capacitor.  The 

reference  current  is  only  available  during  the  duration  of  the  ramp,  but  symmetrical 

bipolar currents can be derived alternately, from the rising and falling edges, allowing 

two point calibration. Measurements need to be made a little after the ramp begins, to 

avoid  transients.  The  output  current  can  be  deduced  to  reasonable  accuracy  (~2%) 

solely  by  using  precision  components,  although  the  accuracy  may  be  improved  by 

direct measurement of the current using a standardised electrometer. 

The circuit operates in the following manner. A stabilised 5.00 V supply is generated 

using  voltage  reference  IC1,  and  a  2.50 V  reference  derived  from  it  using  equal 

precision resistors and follower IC4b. A crystal oscillator (IC2) is used to generate a 

stable and symmetrical 15.625 mHz square wave at the output of IC3. The MOSFET 

output stage of IC3 was found to deliver this square wave with precise amplitudes to 

within 1 mV of the 5.00 V supply and ground. The square wave is used as the input to

an integrator based on C1 and IC4a, via R1, with the integrator centred at 2.50 V. If 

IC4  is  chosen  to  have  a  negligible  input  bias  current,  the  5.00 V  square  wave  will 

cause equal bipolar integrator input currents, and associated rising and falling voltage 

ramps  at  IC4a  output.  The  final  output  current  is  generated  via  the  differentiator 

comprising  C2  (the  calibration  capacitor  Ccal)  and  the  input  stage  of  the  Current

Eq. B.6, 

where  ‚àÜV  is  the  integrator  input  voltage  (‚Äì2.50 V).  C1,  C2  and  R1  are  thermally 

stable,  close-tolerance  components.  The  choice  of  C2  is  based  on  a  compromise 

between  a  sufficiently  large  value  to  minimise  the  effect  of  unknown  stray 

capacitances  (with  the  associated  thermal  and  temporal  stability  of  the  connection 

geometry) and a small value to maximise the source impedance and reduce the noise 

gain of the electrometer at high frequencies. In practise the first constraint was found 

to be the more important parameter, as the noise generated on the ramp voltage was 

small and the electrometer could be operated in a low frequency mode. 

The  integrator  can  be  reset  using  the  MOSFET  switches  in  IC5,  which  are  set  by 

default in the RUN (i.e. current reference operating) condition. In the STOP state the 

oscillator and counters are reset, and the output of IC4 is pulled to ground via IC5c. 

This effectively eliminates leakage across the output capacitor C2 in the STOP state, 

allowing  the  Current  Reference  to  be  permanently  connected  to  a  slow  response 

Current Amplifier, without any additional high impedance switching. 

For  the  component  values  used,  the  rate  of  change  of  ramp  voltage  was  measured 
using  a  chart  recorder  to  be  ‚Äì52.5   mVs-1,  with  the  ramp  starting  and  finishing  at 

2.5 V.  Tests  using  a  Keithley  6512  electrometer  showed  the  output  current  to  be  of 

magnitude 470 ‚Äì 2 fA, alternately positive and negative for 32 s each. Measurements 

were made 5 s after the ramp transition. The Current Reference was found to be stable 
to ‚Äì 2 fA for slowly-varying temperatures over the range ‚àí22 to 21.7 (cid:176)C. The bipolar 

output  currents  also  remained  symmetrical  to  within  the  accuracy  of  measurement

over  this  range,  although  sudden  thermal  shocks  to  the  output  capacitor  C2  during 

initial cooling led to some transient asymmetric currents.

DECAY tests the MME follower mode, and the voltage decay of the central electrode. 

It charges up the central electrode, switches it off and makes 2 Hz measurements of 

the voltage decay in follower mode. The bias voltage can also be varied cyclically.

Appendix E 

The development of an integrated scientific perception of 
atmospheric particulates during the twentieth century  
 
E.1 Introduction 

Interest in the electrical properties of the air is not new and probably began as a result 

of curiosity about spectacular natural phenomena like the aurorae and lightning. Yet 

successful measurements and understanding of air-borne particles, which contribute to 

these  phenomena,  are  clearly  products  of  the  science  of  the  twentieth  century.  The 

reasons  for  the  surge  of  interest  in  the  field  from  1898  onwards  are  examined  and 

suggest that a complex combination of scientific circumstances played a crucial r(cid:244)le, 

motivating  and  facilitating  research  into  air  ions  and  their  electrical  properties.  The 

development of the subject is followed, towards the (cid:147)modern(cid:148) approach of the present 

day,  with  air  ions  generally  considered  as  part  of  the  continuum  of  atmospheric 

aerosol particles. Finally, a case study of the relationship between atmospheric small 

ion  and  aerosol  concentration  acts  as  a  supporting  example,  and  relates  historical 

scientific discoveries to contemporary work (e.g. Guo et al., 1996). 

E.1.1 Air ions in context 

Today  the  study  of  air  ions  is  based  primarily  upon  the  idea  of  their  continual 

interaction  with  other  parts  of  the  atmospheric  aerosol  spectrum,  but  their  special 

contribution  to  atmospheric  electricity  is  also recognised. This article traces the r(cid:244)le 

of air ions and their relevance to different aspects of twentieth century physics, within 

a broad historical context.  

The  route  to  our  current  perception  of air ion behaviour can be characterised by the 

development of two focal areas. Firstly, there was a need for a semantic framework to 

describe  and  answer  problems  effectively.  The  unification  of  the  initially  separate 

studies  of  (cid:147)dust(cid:148)  and  air  ions  was  also  a  crucial step in the progression towards the 

contemporary approach.

Appendix E: Historical discussion 
 

E.1.2 Background: The discovery of the electron 

The  first  publication  directly  related  to  air  ions  seems  to  be  by  Zeleny  in  1897  and 

research into the subject became very popular in the early years of this century. In a 

thorough  and  well-researched  article,  Flagan  (1998)  suggests  that  the  problem  of 

charge  dissipation  in  the  atmosphere  was  enough  to  motivate  the  plethora  of  papers 

published from 1898-1930. This problem had been known for many years, and could 

ostensibly  only  be  investigated  after  the  discovery  of  the  electron  in  1897  by  J.J. 

Thomson explained the true nature of the ion. Yet it seems unlikely that this would be 

a pressing enough problem for so many workers to become involved, especially when 

there was so much new work to do in physics at the turn of the century. In addition, 

much of the research into air ions clearly evolved from experiments initially unrelated 

to atmospheric science, see for example Rutherford (1897) and McClelland (1898). 

 
Ions were first identified by Faraday in his 19th century work on electrochemistry, and 

were  known  to  be  produced  by  some  sort  of  breakdown  of  molecules  in  an  electric 

field. Helmholtz developed this work to define the electric charge on the atom as the 

finite quantity of electricity carried by all ions. Stoney then used the word (cid:147)electron(cid:148) 

for the first time to describe a fundamental amount of electricity (Robotti, 1995). It is 

well known that J.J. Thomson identified the constituents of cathode rays as the first 

sub-atomic particles, which he called (cid:147)corpuscles(cid:148), in 1897. As the idea of the atom 

breaking up in any way had been inconceivable since Democritus, who first used the 

term, Thomson lacked sufficient evidence to immediately identify the corpuscle with 

a  fundamental  unit  of  both  electricity  and  matter.  Robotti  discusses  Thomson(cid:146)s 

attempts to measure the charge of the corpuscles independently. It was only when this 

measurement  had  been  completed,  that  the  corpuscle  could  be  recognised  as  the 

electron. According to Robotti, Thomson based the whole research programme at the 

Cavendish Laboratory around this aim. It is fortunate for physics, and meteorology in 

particular,  that  he  did  so.  Ernest  Rutherford  and  C.T.R.  Wilson  were  taken  on  as 

research  students  in  the  1890s.  Although  they  became  famous  for  work  outside  this 

field,  (Wilson(cid:146)s  being  particularly  important  to  meteorology)  both  men  produced 

valuable  work  related  to  ions  in  the  air  during  this  period  at  the  Cavendish 

Laboratory.

One of the areas investigated by Thomson was the conduction of electricity through 

gases. Coulomb in 1795 was the first person to notice that the atmosphere is slightly 

electrically  conductive,  finding  that  an  insulated  gold  leaf  electrometer  would 

discharge slowly in air. Roentgen(cid:146)s timely discovery of X-rays (in 1896) was another 

circumstance  that  abetted  research  into  ions  in  gases.  It  was  quickly  found  that 

(cid:147)Roentgen  rays(cid:148)  made  gases  electrically  conductive  by  ionisation.  This  probably 

appealed  to  Thomson  because  of  the  potential  for  measuring  the  charge  of  the 
corpuscles  that  were  produced.  The  Concise  Dictionary  of  Scientific  Biography76 

(1981) explains that Thomson took a new approach to the problem of conduction of 

electricity  through  gases,  describing  ions  in  terms  of  experimentally  defined 

parameters  (such  as  mobility)  when  previously,  only  the  dynamics  of  molecular 

collisions  were  considered  (proving  inadequate  to  explain  the  problem).  This  could 

well derive from his desire to measure the charge on the corpuscle without reference 

to  pre-existing  particles.  The  arrival  of  the  experimentalist  C.T.R.  Wilson  at  the 

laboratory permitted further progress with some theoretical work of Thomson(cid:146)s from 

1893, relating to the effect of charged particles on condensation. Roentgen rays were 

found  to  increase  the  condensation  rate  in  a  saturated  chamber,  and  these  results, 

combined with Thomson(cid:146)s relating to ionisation increasing the electrical conductivity 

of  gases,  led  them  to  surmise  that  ions  acted  as  cloud  condensation  nucleii  in 

supersaturated conditions not found in the atmosphere (Robotti, 1995). 

This work did not lead to the direct measurement of the charge of the corpuscle, but it 

provided a method for e to be measured using the photoelectric effect. Thomson could 

then present his revolutionary idea, that the electron was fundamental, both as a unit 

of  electrical  charge  and  within  the  atom.  Robotti  summarises,  (cid:147)Thomson(cid:146)s 

measurement  of  the  charge  of  the  corpuscle  meant  that  (cid:133)  all  electrical  phenomena 

would  have  to  be  re-examined(cid:148).  This  is  absolutely  fundamental  to  the  history  of  air 

ion  measurements.  Thomson(cid:146)s  preliminary  work  had  provided  a  conceptual  and 

experimental  framework  within  which  atmospheric  electricity  could  be  considered, 

and  his  eventual  result  provided  motivation  for  further  work  in  all  aspects  of 

electricity.

E.2 Development of the study of air ions 

One way to define science is as a progressive activity which moves from one theory 

to  another  (e.g.  Kuhn,  1967),  with  later  theories  generally  thought  of  as  closer 

approximations  to  the  truth.  One  does  not  have  to  subscribe  to  any  particular 

philosophical approach to scientific progress to appreciate that every new framework 

of  scientific  thought  brings  with  it  a  new  terminology.  The  acknowledgement  and 

ultimately,  application  of  the  new  language  by  scientists  working  in  similar  fields 

signifies the true acceptance of the exemplar. Thomson(cid:146)s work on gaseous ions was 

hardly  revolutionary  on the same scale as the discovery of the electron, more a new 

approach which had evolved from his efforts to solve a different problem. Yet it did 
require a new terminology, and the development of the (cid:147)20th century(cid:148) approach to ion 

measurements  can  be  traced  by  the  introduction  of  Thomson(cid:146)s  new  terms  into  the 

scientific vernacular. 

Consider  the  concept  of  electrical  mobility  as  defined  by  Thomson  in  his  book  The 

Conduction of Electricity Through Gases, which was first published in 1903. 

vd=¬µ
E

 

Eq. E.1 

Mobility,  ¬µ,  was  a  powerful  parameter  to  describe  the  motion  of  ions  in  an  electric 

field because it relates the drift velocity attained by the charged particle, vd to E, the 

magnitude  of  the  electric  field.  This  assumes  the  Stokes  r√ògime,  which  is  when  the 

electrostatic  forces  acting  on  the  particle  balance  the  drag  forces.  After  the  work  of 

Wellisch (1909) and Cunningham (1910) electrical mobility could also be related to 

particle radius and mass. 

 

 

 

Zeleny (1898) discovered that negative ions needed a larger potential difference to be 

deflected by the same amount as the positive ions. This implies that the negative ions 

have a higher velocity (and hence mobility) than positive ions. Zeleny reported these 

results  apparently  without  appreciating  the  concept  of  mobility  as  defined  by 

Thomson. In his papers from 1898 and 1900, he refers continually to the velocity of 

ions in an electrical field, and his tables of results are headed with, (cid:147)velocity of ions in 
an electric field of 1 Vm-1(cid:148). According to Flagan (1998), Zeleny was responsible for 

the  definition  of  critical  mobility  in  the  cylindrical  condenser,  that  is,  the  minimum 

mobility of ion that would hit the plate T and contribute to the electrometer deflection. 

Appendix E 

258

Appendix E: Historical discussion 
 

With hindsight this is true, but Zeleny only defined a critical ionic velocity, indicating 

that  by  1900  the  importance  of  mobility  as  a  parameter  had  not  been  directly 

recognised. 

In 1900 C.T.R. Wilson described some experiments by Elster and Geitel related to the 

rate of discharge of an electrified body in air. Using Thomson(cid:146)s value for the charge 
on  the  ions,  the  ionisation  rate  was  calculated  at  20  ions  cm-3s-1  for  each  sign. 

Wilson(cid:146)s  terminology  in  this  paper  is  interesting.  He  was  still  working  at  the 

Cavendish Laboratory at this time and had begun his scientific career under Thomson, 

so Wilson, if anybody, would use the rhetoric developed by his supervisor. Yet he is 

still  referring  to  the  charge  on  the ion, and not explicitly equating it to what is now 

called the charge on the electron. However, as Thomson himself continued to refer to 

the  electron  as  the  corpuscle  occasionally  until  the  1920s,  this  is  possibly 

understandable. It appears that the concept of mobility was not outlined clearly until 

Conduction  of  Electricity  through  Gases,  which  was  published  in  1903.  This  is 

supported  by  the  terminology  used  by  Thomson(cid:146)s  students;  Rutherford  (1897)  only 

refers  to  ionic  velocity  and  not  mobility.  The  concept  of  mobility  (if  not  a  full 

understanding)  seems  to  have  been  recognised  by  1909,  as  Wellisch  referred  to  it 

continually in a paper entitled, On the mobilities of ions produced by Rontgen rays in 

gases  and  vapours.  Even  though  Wellisch  first  derived  the  relationship  between 
mobility ¬µ and mass m, 

1‚àù¬µ
m

 

Eq. E.2 

he incorrectly used the units of velocity when referring to mobility. By 1914 Swann 

was  aware  of  the  critical  mobility  of  a  cylindrical  condenser,  but  still  discussed 

mobility indirectly, as a mass-velocity relationship. Pollack (1915) used the new term 

explicitly when presenting results pointing to the existence of a larger, low mobility 

ion in the air. 

 

 

 

E.3 From ‚Äúdust‚Äù to ‚Äúaerosol‚Äù 

Aitken  (1880)  was  one  of  the  first  scientists  to  study  atmospheric  aerosol,  covering 

many  of  the  most  important  issues  in  aerosol  science  today  in  one  short  paper.  He 

suggested that (cid:147)infinitesimally small and invisible particles(cid:148) were necessary to create 

Appendix E 

259

Appendix E: Historical discussion 
 

droplets  in  clouds,  because  (cid:147)burned  sulphur(cid:148)  had  been  shown  to  be  a  good  fog 

producer. Aitken also proposed the following sources of fine atmospheric dust: dried 

spray from the ocean (salt was invoked separately), meteoric matter and combustion 

products.  In  the  1890s  Thomson  and  Wilson  showed  ions  could  also  act  as  cloud 

condensation  nucleii.  The  first  direct  link  between  dust  and  ions  is  credited  to 

Rutherford (1897), who explained that dust particles reduced the conductivity of the 

air because of the small ions attaching to them. In 1923 Nolan presented the results of 

experiments showing that ions were surrounded by water molecules. This must have 

provoked analogies between the smallest (ions) and largest particles (cloud droplets) 

then known to exist in the atmosphere. Langevin (in Flagan, 1998) also furthered the 

relationship between small ions and aerosol by discovering large ions. The large ion 

concentration  was  found  to  correlate  with  the  aerosol  concentration,  and  was 

anticorrelated  with  ionic  variations,  perhaps  placing  large  ions  between  aerosol  and 

smaller  ions  in  some  broad  spectrum.  The  third  edition  of  Thomson(cid:146)s  book  (1928) 

summarises contemporary work on ions in gases and their relationship to aerosol. He 

interprets  some  very  low  mobility  ions  found  by  Langevin  in  Paris  in  1908  as 

(cid:147)charged  particles  of  dust(cid:148)  and  relates  them  obliquely  to  pollution:  (cid:147)the  number  of 

them [is] much greater in large towns than in the open country(cid:148). 

The  above  summary  of  aerosol  science  in  the  first  quarter  of  the  century  shows  the 

basis of the (cid:147)continuum(cid:148) view of atmospheric aerosol, and the growing perception of 

aerosol  as  a  product  of  anthropogenic  activity.  Yet  nobody  had  directly  referred  to 

particulates  as  pollutants.  Aitken  (1880)  even  suggested  that  sulphur(cid:146)s  combustion 

products  might  somehow  deodorise  London(cid:146)s  polluted  streets.  By  the  1940s  and 

1950s  scientists  were  becoming  more  aware  of  the  magnitude  and  variety  of 

particulate  matter  emissions.  The  relevance  and  potential  harmfulness  of  small 

particles  suspended  in  the  air,  which  were  becoming  known  as  (cid:147)aerosol(cid:148)  had  also 

been  noted  (Hewson,  1951).  The  emergence  of  this  perception  of  aerosol  pollution 

was concurrent with the massive and uncontrolled growth of industrialisation and car 

usage in the Western world (Elsom, 1992).

Appendix E: Historical discussion 
 

small  ions  and  atmospheric  particulate  matter  is  to  consider  the  direct  relationship 

between  them.  The  direct  effect  that  particulates  have  on  the  air  is  to  reduce  its 

electrical  conductivity.  The  number  of  small  ions, which cause the air to be slightly 

conductive, decreases as the aerosol number concentration increases. This is because 

of  attachment  of  the  ions  to  the  much  larger  aerosol  particles.  This  effect  was  first 

noticed in the atmosphere by Wait (1946) following conductivity measurements over 

the oceans on the cruises of the research ship Carnegie (Chalmers, 1967) from 1912 

onwards. Rutherford (1897) had been the first to publish the idea that larger particles 

reduce the number of small ions, but it took many years for this idea to be formalised 

from  its  first  inception  (Rutherford,  1897).  The  relationship  between  aerosol 

concentration and air conductivity has only recently been experimentally investigated 

with the aim of improving aerosol measurements (Aplin et al., 1998). The progression 

of  separate  measurements  of  air  ions  (e.g.  Rutherford,  1897)  and  aerosol  (Aitken, 
1890)  of  the  late  19th  century  towards  their  integration  in  the  late  20th  century  (e.g. 

Guo  et  al.,  1996)  is  a  useful  indicator  of  the  change  in  perceptions  of  atmospheric 

particles. 

 

 

 

Rutherford(cid:146)s  initial  attempts  to  describe  ionic  equilibrium  in  the  air  did  not  include 

any  effects  from  ions  recombining  with  aerosol,  although  he  clearly  understood  the 

physical processes involved:  

(cid:147)Since the dust-particles are very large compared with the ions, an ion is 

more likely to strike against the dust-particle, and give up its charge to it or 

to adhere to the surface(cid:133) and the rate of loss of conductivity is much more 

rapid than if the loss of conductivity were due to collisions between the ions 

themselves(cid:148).  

No  attempt  was  made  to  express  the  attachment  of  small  ions  to  larger  particles 

mathematically until Nolan et al. (1925). It is unclear why the Cambridge physicists 

all  neglected  this  effect  in  their  equations,  though  they  were  well  aware  of  it.  (It  is 

possible that their outlook was so focussed upon investigating ions in the laboratory, 

that they thought attachment to particles in the air was unimportant or unnecessary.) 

In  considering  the  equilibrium  case,  where  the  ion  production  rate  equals  the 

Appendix E 

261

Appendix E: Historical discussion 
 

recombination  rate,  the  only  loss  term  expressed  in  the  equation  described  self-

attachment (ions recombining with others of the opposite sign). The equation used by 

Thomson, Rutherford and Wilson in many papers on this topic was: 

q Œ±=
2n

 

Eq. E.3 

Here,  q  is  the  rate  of  ion  production,  n  is  the ion number concentration and Œ± is an 

self-attachment  coefficient.  Nolan  et  al.  (1925)  added  an  extra  term  to  account  for 

ions combining with ions and larger particles. The rate of attachment is proportional 

to the number of ions and the number of aerosol particles. The equation here is given 

in the form used today (Nolan et al. used a slightly different notation). 

q

=

Œ≤Œ± +
2

n

nZ

 

Eq. E.4 

In  Eq.  E.4,  Z  is  the  monodisperse  aerosol  number  concentration  and  Œ≤  is  an 

attachment  coefficient.  It  took  some  time  for  this  coefficient  to  be  described 

theoretically,  possibly  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  physics  underlying  the 

attraction  between  a  small  charged  particle  and  a  larger  uncharged  one.  Various 
attempts  were  made  to  find  Œ≤  experimentally,  but  they  varied  over  an  order  of 

magnitude  (Wait  and  Parkinson,  1951).  Œ≤    is  dependent  on  the  size  of  the  ions  and 

aerosol  particles  measured,  so  further  measurements made in different locations and 

using  different  techniques  added  to  the  confusion.  Bricard  (1949)  appears  to  have 
developed  the  first  working  method  for  calculating  Œ≤.  After  Bricard,  a  number  of 

other workers approached the problem; some of this is reviewed in Harrison (1992).  

 

 

 

Acceptance  of  the  idea  of  using  the  properties  of  the  smallest  particles  in  the  air  to 

monitor  the  largest  ones  appears  to  have  required  the  simultaneous  development  of 

three branches of this field. Air conductivity measurements had to be carried out in a 

variety  of  locations  before  it  was  realised  that  the  urban  areas  showed  much  lower 

conductivity  than  the  rural  ones.  Long  term  clean  air  measurements  of  atmospheric 

electrical  parameters  in  the  remote  oceans  led  to  the  perception  that  clean  air 

conductivity  could  be  used  as  a  secular  pollution  indicator  (Wait,  1946).  An 

awareness  of  increasing  particulate  pollution  levels,  combined  with  a  rigorous 

approach  to  aerosol  attachment  processes  completed  the  knowledge  needed  to  bring 

the relationship between atmospheric electrical processes and aerosol to the state they 

are in today.

E.5 Conclusions 

There has been a kind of paradigm shift (Kuhn, 1967) in the science of atmospheric 

particles during the twentieth century. Aitken started to investigate aerosol particles in 

the  1880s,  but  understanding  of  the  smallest  particles  lacked  motivation  or  a 

theoretical basis. Discovery of the electron provided justification for the existence of 

the atmospheric ion, plus terminological and experimental frameworks to understand 

the ions and their properties. Following this, measurements of air ions combined with 

an  increase  in  pollution  necessitated  development  of  theories  explaining  the 

interaction of these particles. This established the methodology for the integrated way 

scientists  have  studied  atmospheric  particulates  in  the  second  half  of  this  century. 

Without the progression elucidated above, there would not be the understanding of the 

atmospheric  aerosol  continuum  and  its  contemporary  relevance  for  climate  change, 

pollution issues and atmospheric electricity.

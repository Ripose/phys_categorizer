A tapered semiconductor amplifier is injection seeded by a femtosecond optical frequency comb at 780 nm from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser. 
Energy gains over 17 dB (12 dB) are obtained for 1 mW (20 mW) of average input power when the input pulses are stretched into the picosecond 
range.  A  spectral  window  of  supercontinuum  light  generated in a photonic  fiber has  also been  amplified.  Interferometric  measurements  show  sub-
hertz  linewidths  for  a  heterodyne  beat  between  the  input  and  amplified  comb  components,  yielding  no  detectable  phase-noise  degradation  under 
amplification.  These  amplifiers  can  be  used  to  boost  the  infrared  power  in  f-to-2f  interferometers  used  to  determine  the  carrier-to-envelope  offset 
frequency, with clear advantages for  stabilization of octave-spanning femtosecond lasers and other supercontinuum light sources with very  limited 
power in the infrared.

Tapered  semiconductor  amplifiers  (TSA)  are  known  to 
provide  large  gains  (≥  20  dB)  for  near  infrared  continuous-
wave (cw) lasers, converting a few milliwatts of cw radiation 
to  more  than  1  W,  without  degradation  in  linewidth1.  These 
amplifiers have been widely used in atomic spectroscopy1,2,3, 
laser cooling and trapping4, and for increasing the efficiency 
of nonlinear frequency conversion of cw lasers into the blue 
and UV regions3,4,,5. Amplification of picosecond pulses with 
semiconductor  amplifiers  has  also  been  the  subject  of 
numerous  investigations 6 , 7,  particularly  in  connection  with 
optical  communications.  Semiconductor  amplifiers  enjoy 
inherent  advantages  of  compactness,  optical  integration,  and 
reduced cost. In this Letter we show that TSA can be used to 
amplify  short  pulse  trains  from  a  femtosecond  frequency 
comb 8 ,  while  preserving  the  optical  phase  coherence.  To 
overcome  problems  related  to  gain  saturation  and  finite 
carrier  recombination  time  in  semiconductors  (~  100s  of 
picoseconds),  the  pulses  need  to  be  pre-stretched  (chirped)9. 
These  features  suggest  their  use  for  precise  optical  time 
transfer 10 , 11 , 12  over  fiber  networks.  In  addition,  we  have 
amplified  a  spectral  window  of  supercontinuum 
light 
generated  in  a  photonic  fiber,  with  gains  approaching  the 
unsaturated cw gain at low input powers. TSA can thus aid f-
to-2f  interferometers  used  to  measure  and  stabilize  the 
carrier-to-envelope  offset  frequency  of  mode-locked  lasers8. 
This can be of particular advantage for phase stabilization of 
octave-spanning 
 or  other 
supercontinuum near IR laser systems that suffer from limited 
power in the long-wavelength portion of their spectrum.

With its temperature stabilized to 22 0C, the tapered 
semiconductor  amplifier 15 delivers  an  output  power  of  500 
mW at 780 nm for an injected current of 1.5 A. The amplifier 
has  a  maximum  injection  current  of  3.0  A,  with  input  and 
output apertures of 3 and 190 µm, respectively, and a length 
of 2750 µm. The small input aperture requires careful  mode 
matching,  although  the  circular  input  mode  is  not  shaped  to 
the elliptical mode of the TSA. The amplifier performance is 
tested  under  both  cw  and  short  pulse  injection.  A  single-

frequency diode laser at 780 nm is used as a cw light source. 
Short pulses are from a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser, which 
emits 25 fs pulses at 100 MHz repetition rate, in a transform-
limited bandwidth (BW) of 35 nm (FWHM) centered at 780 
nm. These pulses have been chirped up to 400 ps by passing 
through  different  lengths  of  optical  fibers.  Figure  1  shows 
normalized  spectra  for  the  Ti:sapphire  laser  before  and  after 
passing through a 21-m long fiber, which chirps the pulses to 
150  ps  and  introduces  some  spectral  broadening  (BW=44 
nm).  Also  shown  is  the  spectrum  of  the  corresponding 
amplified  pulses,  showing  a  gain  BW  of  14  nm.  Spectral 
components  outside  the  amplifier  bandwidth  are  strongly 
attenuated. In our measurements of gain, pulse shape, spectra, 
and  phase  coherence,  we  also  use  a  3-nm  bandpass  filter  at 
780  nm  (Fig.  1)  to  limit  the  laser  bandwidth  within  the 
amplifier  bandwidth.  Input  and  output  pulse  shapes  are 
measured by using a fast photodetector (15-ps response time) 
and  a  12-GHz  sampling  oscilloscope.  Amplification  of 
chirped  pulses  in  our  TSA  differs  from  chirped  pulse 
amplification  (CPA)  schemes  because 
is 
saturated  and  its  gain  bandwidth  is  smaller  than  the 
bandwidth  of  the  pulse  to  be  amplified.  CPA  has  been 
recently  demonstrated  with  TSA  by  chirping  picosecond 
pulses to several nanoseconds9.

Figure 2 summarizes the results for amplification of 
cw  and  short  pulses  as  a  function  of  the  input  power  (pulse 
energy)  and  pulse  duration  (chirp).  Using  the  cw  laser,  or

laser,

transparency is achieved for a bias current of 670 mA. For cw 
injection and a current of 2.0 A, an unsaturated (small signal) 
gain  of  20  dB  is  measured,  which  reduces  to  14  dB  for  an 
input  power  of  20  mW.  From  the  cw  gain  curve,  the 
saturation  power  Psat  is  estimated  to  be  48  mW,  in  good 
agreement with the TSA specifications15. 18 mW (42 mW) of 
input cw power is amplified to 500 mW at the output under a 
bias  current  of  2.0  A  (1.7  A).  For  short  pulse  injection,  we 
measure the average input and output powers. When the laser 
bandwidth  exceeds  the  amplifier  gain  bandwidth,  the  input 

power  is  corrected  accordingly.  In  all  gain  values  shown  in 
Fig. 2, the amplified spontaneous emission power (19±1 mW 
at  2.0  A,  without  input  light)  has  been  subtracted  from  the 
output  power,  which  may  lead  to  some  underestimation  of 
gain at higher input powers. 

Semiconductor  amplifiers  for  picosecond  pulses 
have  been  the  subject  of  numerous  investigations6,7, 16, 17, 18. 
The  carrier  dynamics  is  complex,  with  several  processes 
occurring  both  at  ultrafast  (fs)  and  slow  time  scales  (§  ns). 
The  main  limitation  for  amplifying  short  pulses  arises  from 
time  τc  of  a  few  hundred 
the  carrier  recombination 
picoseconds6. A strong and fast pulse can quickly reduce the 
carrier  density  and  deplete  the  gain,  which  then  takes 
hundreds of picoseconds to recover. In this  way, the trailing 
edge  of  a  pulse  can  experience  a  substantially  reduced  gain. 
This  gain  variation  also  causes  index  of  refraction  changes 
responsible for self phase modulation (SPM)6. It distorts both 
the  pulse  shape  and  spectrum,  which  in  general  become 
asymmetrical6 (Figs. 1 and 2). This distortion depends on the 
amplifier  gain,  initial  chirp,  pulse  duration  and  input  energy 
(Ein)  compared  to  the  saturation  energy  (Esat)7.  If  each  pulse 
considerably  reduces  the  gain,  the  recombination  time  will 
also  limit  the  repetition  rate  of  amplified  pulses  to  a  few 
GigaHertz.  For  femtosecond  pulses,  another  important  time 
scale on the order of several hundred fs associated with non-
equilibrium  ultrafast  carrier  heating  dynamics  is  responsible 
16, making the gain at increased input 
for lower values of Esat
power to be much lower than for longer pulses.  

Figure 2 shows the gain for 25-fs transform-limited 
(TL) pulses and for pulses that have been chirped by fibers to 
150  and  320  ps.  The  TSA  BW  (14  nm),  smaller  in 
comparison  to  the  pulse  BW,  converts  these  input  pulses  to 
62 fs, 47 ps, and 101 ps, respectively. It is expected that the 
gain for pulses with duration τp approaches the cw gain if τp 
¥  τc  and  Ein  <<  Esat  7.  We  applied  the  simplified  model  of 
Ref.  7,  extended  to  include  spontaneous  emission  17  and 
chirped input pulses, in an attempt to account for the results 
shown in Fig. 2. The asymmetric pulse shapes (inset of Fig.2) 
are reproduced, with their durations shorter than the input due 
to  spectral  filtering  of  the  amplifier  gain  BW.  Although 
individual  curves  in  Fig.  2  can  be  reproduced,  assuming 
reasonable values of Esat of 60-300 pJ, and τc of 0.2-1 ns, no 
single combination of Esat and τc reproduces all curves, based 
on the simple model of ref. 7. A detailed quantitative analysis 
of  the  experimental  results  would  require  taking  into 
consideration the amplifier geometry and gain profile, carrier 
heating,  ultrafast  dynamics16,  and  pulse  propagation 
effects7,18. In particular, the fast decrease of gain for TL 25-fs 
pulses is attributed to smaller values of Esat resulting from the 
carrier heating dynamics 16. 

Figure 3 shows gain curves for input powers <1 mW 
and also when input pulses are spectrally filtered by the 3-nm 
bandpass filter at 780 nm placed before the amplifier. In this 
case, for example, pulses that were chirped to 320 ps and then 
spectrally filtered, are shortened to 21 ps. The gain for the 21 
ps  (3  nm)  pulse  is  expected  to  be  significantly  smaller  than 
that  of  the  101  ps  (14  nm)  pulse  due  to  the  shorter  pulse 

the  curve  corresponding 

duration.  On  the  other  hand,  the  21  ps  pulses  experience 
higher  gains  since  their  spectrum  is  near  the  peak  of  the 
amplifier  gain  (Fig.1).  The  combined  effects  lead  to  a 
somewhat reduced gain by 1 - 3 dB with respect to the 101 ps 
pulses.  Fig.3  also  shows 
to 
amplification  of  a  spectral  window  (3  nm  at  780  nm)  of 
supercontinuum  light  generated  in  a  microstructure  fiber  for 
stabilizing  the  carrier-to-envelope  offset  frequency  of  the 
comb. For average input powers limited to 300 µW (within a 
3 nm band at 780 nm), we observe gains ranging from 12 to 
18  dB.  Since  the  input  pulse  durations  are  in  between  the 
transform 
the  chirped 
picosecond  pulses  discussed  above,  the  faster  decrease  of 
gain here can also be attributed to smaller Esat due to carrier 
heating  16.  These  gain  values  demonstrate  that  TSA  can  be 
particularly  useful  in  amplifying  a  spectral  window  of 
supercontinuum  light  in  the  near  infrared.  For  example,  a 
commercially  available  TSA  operating  at  1.08  µm15  can  be 
used to boost the power in this region by a  factor of 15 dB. 
This  amplification  will  be  beneficial  for  frequency  doubling 
in a nonlinear crystal used in f-to-2f spectrometers. 

limited  femtosecond  pulses  and 

to  be  recorded  at  a  nonzero  value  with 

To  demonstrate  phase  coherence  between  the  input 
and  amplified  frequency  comb,  an  optical  heterodyne  beat 
experiment is performed using a Mach-Zender interferometer 
with  the  tapered  amplifier  in  one  arm  and  an  acousto-optic 
modulator (AOM) in the other. This enables the optical beat 
signal 
the 
interferometer path difference set at a zero delay. By mixing 
the  beat  signal  with  another  high-quality  radio  frequency 
reference,  the  beat  signal  is  downconverted  to  an  acoustic 
frequency  of  a  few  kilohertz  to  allow  analysis  with  a  high-
resolution  fast-Fourier-transform  analyzer.  Figure  4  shows  a 
beat note recorded in a 100-Hz span on the FFT analyzer. The 
beat signals are monitored as a function of the bias current of 
the tapered amplifier,  with no changes up to 2.4 A. Spectral 
features up to a few kHz, corresponding to technical noise of 
electrical  and  acoustic  origins,  have  also  been  observed,  but 
do not contribute significantly to reduce the carrier power of 
the  beat.  The  near  spectral-resolution-limited  0.5-Hz 
linewidth  demonstrates  that  the  TSA  adds  negligible  phase 
noise  during  the  amplification  process,  and  therefore  can  be 
used to amplify light from a frequency comb, preserving the 
phase

experiments.

In summary, we have demonstrated that TSA can be 
used  for  femtosecond  frequency  combs  if  the  pulses  are 
considerably chirped. TSA preserves the phase coherence  of 
the  comb  at  the  10-15  level,  which  is  important  for  optical 
frequency  measurements  and  optical  time  transfer  in  fiber 
networks.  It  can  be  used  to  amplify  a  spectral  window  of 
supercontinuum  light,  with  advantages  for  measuring  and 
stabilizing the carrier-to-envelope offset frequency, with very 
low  power  in  the  infrared  such  as  octave-spanning  lasers  or 
other  low  efficiency  supercontinuum  systems  based  on 
microstructure

Abstract.  
We analyze the transformation properties of Faraday’s law in an empty space and its relation-
ship with Maxwell’s equations. In our analysis we express the Faraday’s law via the four-
potential of electromagnetic field and the field of four-velocity, defined on a circuit under its 
deforming motion. The obtained equations show one more facet of the physical meaning of 
electromagnetic potentials, where the motional and transformer parts of the flux rule are in-
corporated into a common phenomenon, reflecting the dependence of four-potential on spatial 
and time coordinates, correspondingly. It has been explicitly shown that for filamentary 
closed deforming circuit the flux rule is Lorentz-invariant. At the same time, analyzing a 
transformation of e.m.f., we revealed a controversy: due to causal requirements, the e.m.f. 
should be the value of fixed sign, whereas the Lorentz invariance of flux rule admits the 
cases, where the e.m.f. might change its sign for different inertial observers. Possible resolu-
tions of this controversy are discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
It is known that Faraday’s law involves two different phenomena in a single equation: law of 
induction (“transformer” part of induction), and Lorentz force law (“motional” part of induc-
tion, when the circuit moves) [1]. Numerous papers and books were devoted to Faraday’s law. 
However,  its  transformation  properties  were  analyzed  up  to  date  only  in  a  few  papers  (see, 
e.g.,  refs.  [2-6]).  The case of time-variable contour G=G(t) happens to be especially difficult 
for such an analysis, and some ambiguities continue to exist up to now. In particular, one can 
mention the questions as follows: 
1. Is the empirically discovered Faraday’s law

2. If the answer to this question is positive, then the Faraday induction law (1) is necessarily 
Lorentz-invariant. In the case of negative answer, we have to analyze separately transforma-
tion properties of this empirical law. 
3.  Is  there  a  common  physical  origin  for  “transformer”  and  “motional”  parts  of  induction, 
joining them into a single law (1)? And what is a relationship between both parts of induction 
under space-time transformations? 
4. Can we understand the known exceptions from the flux rule? 
 

(3) 

In order to find the answers to the listed questions, we suggest a new methodological 
approach,  where  Faraday’s  law  is  expressed  through  the  four-potential  of  electromagnetic 
field. We believe that such an approach allows one to analyze the transformation properties of 
this law in more detail in comparison with the standard way, where the Faraday’s law oper-
ates with the electric and magnetic fields, composing the components of the electromagnetic 
tensor.  
 
2. On a relationship between Maxwell equation 
Faraday’s law  
 
It is known that the Faraday induction law was discovered experimentally in the first half of 
19th century, and it suggested to Maxwell one of his equations, which was written by Hertz in 
its  modern  form  (2).  Now  we  ask  a  question:  can  we  directly  derive  the  Faraday’s  law  (1) 
from Maxwell’s equation (2)?

The  answer  to  this  question  is  trivial,  when  a  closed  line  of  integration  is  fixed  in 
space. Then both G and S do not depend on time, and integrating Eq. (2) over S and applying 
the Stokes theorem, we obtain

Considering the latter expression, the authors of ref. [2] suggested interpreting the integrand 
of lhs as the electric field E in the rest frame of circuit K. Then the equality

obviously disagrees with the relativistic transformation of an electric field. However, such an 
interpretation is erroneous, because both integrals in Eq. (4) should be evaluated at different 
time  moments  for  different  points  of  circuit,  according  to  the  rule  for  computing  retarded 
e.m.f. (see below). Therefore, Eq. (5) is incorrect, since the field  'E
 should be deter-
mined for the same fixed instant t of the rest frame of the circuit, which corresponds to differ-
ent  't .

The  case,  when  a  circuit  moves  and  simultaneously  changes  its  shape,  is  even  more 
complicated, and the authors of ref. [2] concluded that the flux rule loses its simple relation 
with the Maxwell equation (2). 

Further contributions [3, 4] emphasized incorrectness of Eq. (5) in case of relativistic 
. For such a case Monsivais suggested to modify the Faraday’s law into the form

value along the trajectory. Following the notation of ref. [4], we have used a dotted circle on 
the right integral, which denotes the fact that each its infinitesimal term is measured in differ-
ent frames K’.

This equation was first obtained by Gelman [3]. The author of ref. [4] invented a spe-
cial  symbol:  dotted  circle  in  Eq.  (6)  to  indicate  that  an  integral  over  G  belongs  to  a  special 
kind.  Eq.  (6)  can  be  considered  as the consequence of Maxwell equation (2) and relativistic 
transformation  of  electromagnetic field. However, the authors of ref. [3, 4] concluded that a 
direct calculation of e.m.f. in Eq. (6) is not a simple problem in a general case. Even for rig-
idly moving circuit, when a well-defined e.m.f. e’ in K’ exists,

Thus, for a deforming contour, the Faraday’s law occurs very complicated, when it is 
expressed  via  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  and  it  loses  a  simple  relationship  with  the 
Maxwell  equation  (2). The author of Ref. [5] even suggests modifying Maxwell’s equations 
to make them compatible with the flux rule in a moving frame. In our opinion, an actual fur-
ther progress in the analysis of Faraday’s law can be achieved, when we express the Faraday 
law through the vector and scalar potentials of electromagnetic field.

an e.m.f., according to its general definition (3) and the Lorentz force law. The rhs of Eq. (10) 
describes a time rate of the magnetic flux across the surface S capping the circuit G. Here we 
assume that Eq. (10) is written in the rest frame K of a measuring instrument (voltmeter), and 
both  integrals  are  computed  at  the  same  time  moment.  We  also assume that all functions in 
Eq. (10) are continuous.

Now  we  are  able  to  establish  a  relationship  between  Maxwell’s  equations  and  Fara-
day’s law in full. Namely, the latter law cannot be obtained from Eq. (2) exclusively: its deri-

)  giving  the  rela-

tionship  between  electric  and  magnetic  fields.  Therefore,  the  flux  rule  should  be  inevitably 
Lorentz-invariant.  At  the  same  time,  it  seems  important  to  show  explicitly  the  invariance of 
Faraday’ law (18) for better understanding of its physics. 
 
3. Transformation properties of the Faraday induction law 
 
It is worth to mention at the beginning of this section that the Lorentz invariance of Faraday’s 
law  (flux  rule)  has  been  already  shown  in  a  general  form  [6],  where  the  author  suggested  a 
new Lorentz-invariant generalized form for a magnetic flux. At the same time, such a general 
covariant formulation of Faraday’s law makes difficult to apply it to analysis of many particu-
lar physical problems, dealing with computing an e.m.f. and magnetic fluxes. In addition, the 
authors of the cited above papers did not stress an essential feature of Faraday’s law transfor-
mation in comparison with many other relativistic problems. It is related to physical interpre-

tation  of  the  Lorentz  transformations,  suggested  by  Einstein  in  his  fundamental  paper  [8]. 
Namely, if two inertial frames K and K’ are in relative motion, that each observer in his own 
rest  frame  uses  his  own  measuring  instrument  to  determine  physical  quantities  in  another 
frame.  However,  one  can  see  that  this  is  often  not the case for the Faraday induction law: a 
measuring instrument for e.m.f. (voltmeter) usually represents an inherent part of the moving 
circuit,  and  hence,  any  inertial  observer,  regardless  of  his  particular  velocity  with  respect  to 
the circuit, uses this voltmeter in his measurements. In principle, one can demand that a mov-
ing observer operates with his own voltmeter, included into a circuit by means of sliding con-
tacts. Obviously, the problem, where all inertial observers use in their measurements a single 
voltmeter,  integrated  into  a  circuit,  differs  from  the  problem,  where  each  observer  uses  his 
own voltmeter. Since the latter case has no practical significance, we will analyze the trans-
formation properties of the Faraday induction law, where all observers use the same measur-
ing instrument. Then only in the rest frame of voltmeter K a circular integration over G is car-
( )te . There is no physical meaning to integrate over 
ried out at the same instant t, determining 
( )''te , because this 
the circuit at a fixed moment t’ of some arbitrary inertial frame K’ to find 
value has no simple relation with an actual indication of voltmeter. In order to find such a re-
lationship,  an  integration  time  t’  should  be  connected  with  t  by  means  of  the  Lorentz  trans-
formation

as a rule for computing retarded (advanced) e.m.f. It appears due to the above-mentioned fact: 
a  measuring  instrument  (voltmeter)  is  common  for  all  inertial  observers.  Of  course,  such  a 
voltmeter can be placed at an arbitrary point of a deforming circuit. However, as soon as we 
choose this point and its rest frame K, further integration over a circuit in any Lorentz frame 
K’ should be carried out under the requirement t=const in the frame K.

Further,  continuing  consideration  of  the  Faraday’s  law  transformation,  we  have,  in

Eq. (24) can be used to explore transformation properties of the Faraday induction law 
(flux rule). Note that under derivation of Eq. (24) we did not make any special assumptions 
about the behavior of the closed circuit  G  in the rest frame of the voltmeter K. Hence, both 
integrands in lhs and rhs of Eq. (24) have the same form for primed functions, defined in an 
arbitrary inertial frame K’. Then the Lorentz invariance of flux-rule would mean the equality

Thus, the flux rule is implemented for any inertial observer. Our conclusion coincides 
with the results of refs. [3, 4, 6], although our proof of the Lorentz-invariance of flux rule ex-

pressed via four-potential is the simplest among those presented to date and does not require a 
knowledge  of  the  explicit  form  of  magnetic  flux  transformation  law,  or  introducing  a  new 
physical quantity such as 4-flux [6]. 

A  notation  of  Faraday’s  law  in  forms  (18)  and  (24)  seems  to  be  novel.  Perhaps,  Eq. 
(24) is not significant for practical applications of Faraday’s law, although it clearly indicates, 
in  combination  with  the  rule  for  computing  a  retarded  (advanced)  e.m.f.,  the  Lorentz-
invariance of this law.  

(cid:1)
 with  r

The obtained equations allow revealing a physical meaning of the transformer and mo-
tional parts of Faraday’s law in terms of four-potential of electromagnetic field: namely, the 
(cid:1)
transformer  part  is  determined  by  the  change  of  A
  with  t,  while  the  motional  part  is  deter-
(cid:1)
mined by the change of  A
. Thus, both parts of Faraday’s law have a common physi-
cal  origin:  variation  of  the  vector  potential  as  the  function  of  space-time  four-vector.  Of 
(cid:1)
course,  under  space-time  transformations  a  partial  time  derivative  of  vector  field  A
  can  be 
transformed into its partial spatial derivative, and vise versa. Hence, a relative contribution of 
the  motional  and  transformer  parts  of  Faraday’s  law  into  the  resultant  e.m.f.  is  frame-
dependent,  and  in  the  limiting  particular  cases  the  e.m.f.  in  one  frame  can  be  purely  trans-
former, while in another frame it can be purely motional. Einstein specially emphasized this 
circumstance in his famous work [8]. Now we can say that both parts of Faraday’s law have a 
(cid:1)
common physical origin: variation of  A
 as the function of space-time four-vector. A visible 
distinction between two parts of Faraday’s law appears at the level, when we express this law 
through the electric and magnetic fields. Even so, we have to remember about a common ori-
gin of these phenomena. 

We would like to point out that our analysis was carried out for the geometrical closed 
lines or filamentary closed circuits. In practice we can deal with the closed circuits, which in-
clude extended conductors (e.g., an unipolar inductor). In contrast to filamentary closed lines, 
such a circuit can contain the points of discontinuity of a velocity vector field (e.g., in the slid-
ing  contacts  on  the  boundary  of  moving  extended  conductors).  Then  the  identities  of  vector 
analysis,  containing  a  velocity  parameter  (for  example,  Eqs.  (13),  (14))  become,  in  general, 
incorrect, and the flux rule can be violated, too. At the same time, for such distributed circuits 
one can choose a filamentary closed line, where the points of discontinuity of a velocity vec-
tor field are avoided, and the flux rule is fulfilled (see [11] and references therein). Then it is 
Lorentz invariant according to our analysis. 
 
3.2. Transformation of an e.m.f. 
 
Analyzing  the  transformation  of  an  e.m.f.  itself,  we  are  free  to  take  an  e.m.f.  for  the 
 
rest frame of the voltmeter in any available form (see, lhs of Eqs. (10), (18) and Eq. (25)) and 
then compute its value in any other Lorentz frame. For this purpose we have to transform the 
(cid:1)
velocity vector field  u
, and then to apply either a transformation of electromagnetic fields, or 
electromagnetic potentials, in accordance with the chosen form of Faraday’s law. In addition, 
we  have  to  determine  an  integration  time  in  accordance  with  Eq.  (9).  It  is  important  that  in 
such  calculations  we  deal  with  only  two  Lorentz  frames:  the  rest  frame  of  voltmeter  K  and 
external observer K’, although a special integration procedure of Eq. (5) can be also applied. 
Nevertheless, one should recognize that for an arbitrarily moving deformed circuit any avail-
able  approach  (including  a  parametrical  integration  of  Ref.  [6])  does  not  allow  analytic 
derivation  of  the  law  of  transformation of e.m.f. In these conditions the causal requirements 
give a key to predicting a form of e.m.f. transformation. Indeed: 
- 

if an e.m.f. is equal to zero in one frame of observation, that it should be equal to zero in 
any other frame,  

9

 

- 

- 

if an e.m.f. is positive (negative) in one inertial frame, that it should be positive (negative) 
in any other frame, 
for v=0 (observer be at rest with respect to voltmeter), 
One can see that these three requirements, taken together, determine a form of transforma-

[9]. The same form of function F can be obtained for any moving deforming circuit, if we as-
sume  the  simplest  construction  of  a  voltmeter,  common  for  all  inertial  observers:  a  resistor 
with a high resistance R, connected in series with galvanometer, measuring a current through 
R. Then the e.m.f. is equal to

(33), all obtained as unambiguous consequences of classical electrodynamics, contradict each 
other.  
Analyzing  the  revealed  controversy,  we  assume  the  constant  magnetic  field  within  a 
 
closed circuit G (the case of Eqs. (33), (34)). Then the requirement (32) signifies the existence 
(cid:1)
of such a Lorenz frame, wherein the magnetic field  B
 is identically equal to zero in a vicinity 
(cid:1)
of G, and only the electric field  E
 exists. This field does not penetrate into a bulk of conduct-
=0. Physically it means that a conductor is po-
ing circuit, where the internal electric field

field is equal to zero in this frame of observation, we obtain the equality

everywhere inside the conductor. Due to linearity of the electromagnetic field transformation,

(36) 
in any other Lorentz frame of observation. Hence the e.m.f. is equal to zero in all frames of 
observation  in  accordance  with  Eqs.  (30),  (31).  In  fact,  the  revealed  incompatibility  of  Eq. 
(30), (31) and Eqs. (33), (34) signifies a presence of one more exception from the flux rule, 
which was not reported up to date. It can be demonstrated by the problem in Fig. 1.

An expanding conducting circumference with the radius R(t)=R(0)+vt is placed inside 
the parallel plate condenser. In the rest frame of condenser, only the constant electric field E 
exists along the axis y, and we get Eq. (35) for the internal electric and magnetic field of the 
conductor.  Now  let  us  introduce  an  inertial  frame  K,  wherein  the  condenser  and  circumfer-
ence move at the constant velocity u along the axis x. Since in this frame Eq. (36) holds true, 
then there is no e.m.f. in the circuit. At the same time, the magnetic flux F across the area of 
expanded circumference S and its total time derivative dF/dt are not vanished in the frame K. 
Indeed, in this frame

circuit in Fig. 1 is not vanished, while the e.m.f. in the circuit is equal to zero. We emphasize 
that the revealed exception from the flux rule happens for a filamentary circuit, when the ve-
locity field is a continuous function. At the same time, the electric and magnetic fields contain 
the  points  of  discontinuity  on  a  charged  surface  of  conductor,  and the flux rule is no longer 
valid. These points of discontinuity define a principal difference between real conducting fil-
amentary circuits and closed geometrical lines in space. For geometrical lines the controversy 
between Eqs. (30), (31) and Eqs. (33), (34) persists, and this puzzling requires to be carefully 
analyzed. 
 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
In the introduction to this paper we formulated a number of questions, and all of them are an-
swered below: 
1.  Is  the  empirically  discovered  Faraday’s  law  (1)  equivalent  to  Maxwell’s  equation  (2)  for 
the deforming contour G(t), restricting the area S(t)?  
 

In general, it is not. In order to derive Faraday’s law we have to involve the Lor-

entz force law and a couple of Maxwell’s equations

2. Is the flux rule Lorentz-invariant?  
 
potential of electromagnetic field. 

We  explicitly  showed  the  invariance  of  flux  rule,  expressed  through  a  four-

 with  r

3.  Is  there  a  common  physical  origin  for  “transformer”  and  “motional”  parts  of  induction, 
joining them into a single law (1). And what is a relationship between both parts of induction 
under space-time transformations? 
Expressing the Faraday law through the four-potential, we found that the trans-
 
(cid:1)
former  part  of  Faraday’s  is  determined  by  the  change  of  A
  with  t,  while  the motional 
(cid:1)
part is determined by the change of  A
. Therefore, both parts of Faraday’s law 
(cid:1)
can be incorporated into a common physical phenomenon: variation of  A
 as the func-
tion of space-time four-vector. Under space-time transformations a partial time derivative of 
(cid:1)
vector field  A
 can be transformed into its partial spatial derivative, and vise versa. Hence, a 
relative contribution of the motional and transformer parts of Faraday’s law into the resultant 
e.m.f. is the frame-dependent quantity. 
4. Can we understand the known exceptions from the flux rule? 
 
The known exceptions from the flux rule are related with the properties of the closed 
circuits  (filamentary  lines  or  extended  conductors),  and  do  not  depend  on  the  properties  of 
electromagnetic fields and four-potentials. Therefore, both forms of Faraday law (expressions 
through the fields and through potentials) are relevant for analysis of these exceptions. 
 
At the same time, finding the answers on the foregoing questions, we faced the chal-
lenge,  representing  new  serious  difficulty  of  classical  electrodynamics:  the  e.m.f.  transfor-
mations (30) and (31), being in conformity with causal requirements, contradict the Lor-
entz invariance of flux rule, where an e.m.f. might be an alternating quantity (Eqs. (33), 
(34)). We have shown that for real conducting circuits this controversy is reduced to one more 
exception from the flux rule. In contrast to the known up to date exceptions, happened for ex-
tended conductors, the new exception takes place for filamentary conducting closed circuits, 
and  it  removes  the  contradiction  between  Eqs.  (30),  (31)  and  Eqs.  (33),  (34).  However,  for 
closed geometrical lines in space the controversy between Eqs. (30), (31) and Eqs. (33), (34) 
persists, and this puzzling requires to be carefully analyzed.

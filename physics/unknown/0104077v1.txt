We  report  experimental  results  for  the  Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability  between  two

immiscible fluids in parallel flow in a  Hele-Shaw  cell.  We  focus  our  interest  on  the

influence of the gap size between the walls on the instability characteristics. Experimental

results show that the instability threshold, the critical wavelength, the phase velocity and

the spatial growth rate depend on this gap size. These  results  are  compared  to  both  the

previous  two-dimensional  analysis  of  Gondret  and  Rabaud  (1997)  and  the  three-

dimensional analysis recently derived by Plouraboué and Hinch (2001), showing that the

agreement is still not complete especially when gap size increases.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a shear instability at the interface between two streams

of fluids moving at different parallel velocities. The interface is destabilized by fluid inertia

effect in competition with gravity and surface tension if any. This mechanism is presently

investigated in the particular geometry of a Hele-Shaw cell which consists of two glass

plates separated by a thin gap. In our set-up, a less dense and less viscous fluid (gas) is

flowing horizontally and parallel above a more dense and more viscous fluid (viscous oil),

the gap of the cell being transverse to both gravity and flow direction. Due to the thin gap,

viscous dissipation at the walls is important and the basic flow obeys the Darcy law. The

Hele-Shaw configuration insures that the shear is uniform in the streamwise direction and

time independent [3], contrary to classical mixing layer set-ups. In a prior paper, the shear

instability that arises at the interface between this co-current flow of gas and viscous oil

has been presented both experimentally and analytically [1]. The theoretical analysis was

two-dimensional (2D): the flow is assumed to remain Poiseuille like everywhere in the

thinnest dimension  and  is  then  averaged  through  the  gap  of  the  cell.  The  instability

threshold is shown to be equal to the prediction given by the classical inviscid analysis

(Kelvin-Helmholtz instability) whereas the phase velocity is found to be in agreement with

the value that would be yielded by a pure viscous analysis deriving from the Darcy law. In

such an open flow, the transition from a convective to an absolute regime of the instability

was also predicted analytically and characterized experimentally [4].

The  2D  analysis  has  been  recently  improved  by  Ruyer-Quil  [5]  who  derived  the

appropriate inertial corrections to the Darcy law by using a perturbative method and a

polynomial expansion of the velocity field. This method was used successfully for films

flowing down inclined planes [6]. Although the 2D analysis gives good magnitude orders

(to be shown in Figs. 3, 5 and 6) and explains most of the phenomena observed, it cannot

account  for  all  the  influences  of  the  gap  size  noticed  in  the  experiment.  In  this  paper,

experimental  results  concerning  the  influence  of  the  gap  size  on  the  instability

characteristics are compared to three-dimensional (3D) theoretical developments recently

derived by Plouraboué and Hinch [2].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we summarize the 2D analysis of

Ref. [1] recently improved by Ruyer-Quil [5] and also the new 3D analysis of Plouraboué

and Hinch [2]. After briefly recalling the experimental set-up, we present in  Sec.  III  the

experimental measurements when varying the gap, i. e. the influence of the gap size on the

onset of the instability, the phase velocity, the critical wavelength, and the spatial growth

rate. Finally we compare them to theoretical values from both 2D and 3D analysis.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. Two-dimensional analysis

In a Hele-Shaw cell (Fig. 1), the gap size b  is supposed to be small compared to the scale

of the streamwise variation of the velocity field. Thus the transverse lubrication profile can

be considered to evolve slowly in time and space. With an appropriate average of  the

Navier-Stokes equation through the gap, Ruyer-Quil [5] found that the equation for the

gap  averaged  velocity  u   is  the  following  at  first  order  in  Reynolds  number

B. Three-dimensional analysis

A  3D  analysis  has  been  recently  developed  by  Plouraboué  and  Hinch  [2],  where

unstationary terms are allowed to deviate from the Poiseuille profile. Starting from the full

Navier-Stokes  equation,  the  gap  averaged  description  is  replaced  by  an  asymptotic

analysis  by  considering  the  gap  size  b   small  compared  to  the  critical  wavelength 

c

(b /

c

<< 1). The basic flow, both in gas and oil, is still supposed to be parabolic and a

stationary  perturbed  interface  is  considered.  In  the  small  viscosity  ratio  limit

(

1 /

2

<< 1), the velocity perturbation remains also parabolic in oil as inertia  can  be

neglected in this viscous fluid. However inertia terms are taken into account in the gas and

the  perturbation  for  the  gas  velocity  deviates  from  the  parabolic  profile.  Using  the

lubrication hypothesis and linearizing the Navier-Stokes equation, the pressure is found to

be potential for the two fluids. Thanks to the boundary conditions at the interface, i.e. the

usual dynamic condition for the pressure and the kinematic condition written for the gap

averaged velocity, Plouraboué and Hinch [2] derived a differential equation which links the

velocity profile and the pressure. Their equation is dimensionless and the gap size  b  does

not appear any more except in the gas Reynolds number  Re1

A. Experimental set-up

The cell is made of two glass plates separated by a thin gap  b  which is varied between
- 5  Pa.s and density

0.175 mm and 0.830  mm. The gas (nitrogen of viscosity

experimental set-up has been presented in detail in Ref. [1]. Gravity acts in the plane of

the cell, perpendicular to the interface. Both fluids are injected  at  the  same  controlled

pressure  Pin   and  get  out  at  atmospheric  pressure  Patm .  The  pressure  difference
- Patm  is our experimental control parameter. Below the instability threshold (low

By applying a small periodic modulation of the oil injection pressure, with an amplitude

and a frequency controlled by an electrovalve, the interface develops periodic deformation

locally at the end of the splitter tongue. The perturbation thus created is either damped

(below threshold), marginal (at threshold) or amplified (above threshold), depending on

the values of both forcing frequency  f  and gas velocity U 1 (see Fig. 2 of Ref. [4]). This

behavior allows us to build the experimental marginal stability curve (see Fig.  4  of  Ref.

[1]). The onset of the instability for the gas velocity U 1c  is defined as the minimum of this

curve. All the onset determinations have been made at small forcing amplitude (less than
0.5 mm). For example, at  b = 0.350 mm,  the  onset  corresponds  to  U 1c

= 4.22 m/s with

the most unstable frequency  fc

= 0.4 Hz and the critical wavelength 

» 1.15 cm.  For  a

c

different frequency (lower or upper than  fc ) the unstable state is obtained for larger U 1.

B. Influence of the gap size

In  the  present  work,  measurements  for  six  different  gap  values  have  been  performed.

Experimentally,  the  gap  range  is  limited  at  large  b   (b = 0.830 mm)  and  at  small  b

(b = 0.175mm)  by  the  range  of  our  pressure  regulation.  For  all  these  thicknesses,  the

instability threshold U 1c , the phase velocity V  and the wavelength 

c  at onset and also the

spatial growth rate ki  just above threshold are measured.

1. Instability threshold

The evolution of the experimental onset U 1c  with the gap is presented in Fig. 3 as well as

the results derived from the 2D and 3D theories. The experimental onset  U 1c  increases

slightly with b  up to b = 0.4 mm and strongly for larger  b . The predicted value deriving

from the 2D analysis is independent of the gap size (U 1c

2D = 3.50 m/s) and slightly smaller

than the experimental values. The 3D analysis also shows an increase for the instability

threshold  with  the  gap  size,  though  the  whole  increase  is  quite  smaller  than  the

experimental one. The onset is systematically underestimated of about 15% for small gap

and 50% for larger gap. This disagreement could perhaps be ascribed either to the effect

of the boundary layer existing near the interface between gas  and  oil  or  to  the  fact  that

theories  do  not  take  into  full  account  the  semi-circular  shape  of  the  meniscus  in  the

transverse  direction.  Indeed  these  effects  could  become  important  if  the  condition

b /

c

<< 1 is not well satisfied. Note that at low  b , the injection pressure is large and

compressibility effect thus becomes more important. If taken into account, this effect will
decrease the experimental evolution of  U 1c :  by  17%  at  b = 0.175 mm  and  by  1%  at

b = 0.830 mm. Thus at the smallest gap the agreement between theory and experiment is

much better but disagreement still exists for the largest gap.

2. Phase velocity

The phase velocity  V   of  the  waves  is  also  determined  for  the  different  gaps  at  the

corresponding instability threshold  U 1c .  We  restrict  our  study  to  the  linear  regime,  i.e.

approximately the first centimeters of the interface near  inlet  when  wave  amplitude  is

smaller than 1.5 mm. Spatio-temporal graphs (x,t) have been built by recording a video

line parallel to the interface as a function of time and V  is calculated as the local slope of

the wave trajectories (Fig. 4). Spatial averaged values of  V   on  the  first  centimeters  are

displayed  in  Fig.  5a  and  the  reported  error  bars  correspond  to  the  extrema  measured

values. The phase velocity increases with the gap thickness from typically 5 mm/s  at
b = 0.175 mm to 18 mm/s at  b = 0.830 mm. As  U 1c  also increases with the  gap  b , the

ratio V / U 1c  as a function of  b  is plotted in Fig. 5b. As this ratio still increases with  b ,

the evolution of the phase velocity with the gap is not directly related to the increase of the

onset, but can be considered as intrinsic. The increase of  V  at larger gaps may be due to

relatively less important friction of the waves on the walls. For the 3D theory, the evolution

for both  V  and  V / U 1c  is very similar to the evolution of the experimental values but

with only slightly higher values (Fig. 5). A possible improvement would be to consider the

dissipation in the liquid wall films associated with the wave motion [2]. Concerning the
2D theory, the predictions of a constant phase velocity  V 2D = 6.125 mm/s and a constant

ratio V 2D / U 1c

2D = 1.7510

- 3  are rather good for small b  but fail at larger b  (Fig. 5).

3. Wavelength

Thanks to recorded pictures of the interface, the wavelength 

c   at  onset  for  the  most

unstable frequency  fc  has also been measured directly for the different gap sizes and is

plotted in Fig. 6a. The experimental wavelength increases with the gap, in agreement with

the observed increase in  V   and  the  slight  decrease  of  fc   from  0.43  Hz  to  0.35  Hz
2 D = 0.815  cm is slightly lower

= V / fc ). The value derived from the 2D analysis

than the experimental ones at small gap but yields a good magnitude order. The values

calculated from the 3D analysis increase with the gap as in the experiment but much more

weakly.

4. Spatial growth rate

Finally  we  have  determined  for  each  gap  size  the  spatial  growth  rate  ki   just  above
= 1.03 U 1c .  For  that,  we  fit  the  shape  of  the  wave  during  its  spatial

threshold  at  U 1

amplification  by  the  product  of  an  exponentially growing amplitude,  exp(kix) ,  by  an

oscillatory  signal  of  constant  amplitude  (Fig.  7).  In  Fig.  6b,  the  experimental  spatial

growth rate ki  appears to be nearly constant at the value 18 m-1. The uncertainty for this

value is important (15%) because even so close to threshold, there is only a few arches of

sinusoid to determine ki  before non-linear saturation and important change of 
= kc   for  the  calculation  of 

2D analysis, we consider  ki

2 D / V 2D  with  kr

2D =

. For the

2D   3%

2D  and the set of points is thus on a parabola. Although the values are close to the

experimental ones at low  b , the 2D analysis strongly overestimates  ki  for larger  b  (Fig.

6b). The theoretical estimation of the spatial growth rate obtained with the 3D analysis 3%

above theoretical onset is better but still increases with the gap too strongly compared to

the experimental values (Fig. 6b); for the largest gap, the theoretical value is five times

higher  than  the  experimental  one.  The  three-dimensional  analysis  fails  to  reproduce

precisely the evolution of both wavelength and spatial growth rate even if it improves the

results of the 2D analysis. We have no physical argument to explain why the agreement is

so bad on these variables.

5. Validity of the approximations

Taking the reduced gas Reynolds number  Re1

= U 1b 2k 1 /

1  containing the two length

scales  b  and 1/ k  [2]  there  is  a  good  agreement  between  the  experiments  and  the  3D
= U 1cb2 kc 1 /

1  at  small  b ,  as  for  the  2D  theory.

theory  for  the  threshold  value  Re1c

However, as  b  increases the theoretical value becomes higher than the experimental one:
= 131 theoretically whereas Re1c
e.g., for  b = 0.830 mm, Re1c

= 88 experimentally. This

difference is possibly related to the values of the parameter kb  which are supposed to be

small compared to 1 in the theories, although the 3D predictions are not completely self-

consistent with this hypothesis.  In  Fig.  8,  the  product  kcb   (value  of  kb   at  onset)  as  a
function of b  is displayed: the condition kcb << 1 is correctly satisfied at each gap size in

the experiment but not at large b  for both 2D and  3D  analysis.  A  second  point  is  that

theoretical  values  for  the  most  unstable  frequency  are  different  from  the  one  found
= 2.5 rad/s and

= 3.58 m/s for b = 0.350 mm, 

experimentally: e.g., at the onset U 1c

r exp

= 2 V 2D /

2 D = 4.7 rad/s  or 

c

r 2 D

r 3D

= 5.1 rad/s.  With 

= 5.1 rad/s,  the  3D

r

theory predicts a shape of the velocity perturbation different from a parabola whereas with

= 2.5 rad/s  the  profile  is  closer  (Fig.  2).  The  3D  theory  then  overestimates  the

r

perturbation to the Poiseuille profile.

6. Non-linear shape of the interface

In the results presented above, we have only considered the linear domain. In our set-up

the waves remain linear only along the first centimeters of the cell. The non-linear effects

appear quite rapidly and the waves saturate further. The up/down symmetry is broken and

bumps of the viscous phase propagate on an almost flat interface. The amplitude of the

saturated waves is about 3 mm whatever the gap size is. Snapshots of saturated waves are

presented for two different gaps in Fig. 9: whereas the amplitude remains roughly the

same, the shape  is  quite  different.  However  theoretical  non-linear  predictions  on  this

aspect still remain to be done.

IV. CONCLUSION

In  an  Hele-Shaw  set-up,  we  study  in  detail  the  mechanisms  of  the  Kelvin-Helmholtz

instability when transverse dissipative terms are important. The experimental results show

that the instability characteristics —namely the instability threshold, the critical wavelength,

the phase velocity and the spatial growth rate— strongly increase with the gap size of the

Hele-Shaw cell. In the case of the phase velocity, the evolution with the gap size is close to

the three-dimensional analysis predictions. However, for the other measured quantities, the

agreement  between  experiment  and  theories  existing  for  the  smallest  gaps  is  only

qualitative for the largest gaps. This difference may be due to the theoretical assumption

b /

c

<< 1  which  is  no  more  well  verified  at  large  b   for  both  theories.  The  three-

dimensional  approach  improves  the  two-dimensional  analysis  as  it  gives  the  good

qualitative evolution of the instability characteristics with the gap size. The agreement is

not quantitatively satisfactory and a more complete analysis appears therefore necessary,

possibly including the shape of the meniscus between gas and oil and the dissipation in

the liquid wall films as underlined  in  Ref.  [2].  The  next  necessary  step  is  a  non-linear

study of the instability, both experimentally and theoretically.

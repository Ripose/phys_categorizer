Abstract
In a coherent monoenergetic beam of non-interacting particles, the phase
velocity and the particle transport velocity are functions of position, with the
strongest variation being in the focal region. These velocities are everywhere
parallel to each other, and their product is constant in space. For a coherent
monochromatic electromagnetic beam, the energy transport velocity is never
greater than the speed of light, and can even be zero. The phase velocities
(one each for the non-zero components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, in
general) can be different from each other and from the energy transport
velocity, both in direction and in magnitude. The phase velocities at a given
point are independent of time for both particle and electromagnetic beams.
The energy velocity is independent of time for the particle beam, but in
general oscillates (with angular frequency 2ω) in magnitude and direction
about its mean value at a given point in the electromagnetic beam. However,
there exist electromagnetic steady beams, within which the energy ﬂux,
energy density and energy velocity are all independent of time.

1. Introduction

A continuous beam of identical non-interacting particles of
mass m and energy ¯h2k2/2m is described by a wavefunction
ψ(r)e−iωt , where ω = ¯hk2/2m and ψ(r)
satisﬁes
Schr¨odinger’s time-independent equation (∇ 2 + k2)ψ = 0.
A continuous electromagnetic beam of angular frequency ω
has electric and magnetic ﬁelds E(r, t) and B(r, t) which
can be found from the complex vector potential A(r)e−iωt ,
each component of which satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation
(∇ 2 + k2)ψ = 0, where k = ω/c, c being the speed of
light [1]. (Note that in both the quantum particle beam and the
electromagnetic beam cases the value of k is ﬁxed throughout
the beam by the energy and angular frequency, respectively.
The wavelength within the beam is not, in general, equal to
2π/k and can be very different from 2π/k within the focal
region if the beam is tightly focused.)

Examples of beam wavefunctions are the approximate

solution known as the Gaussian fundamental mode [2–5]:

where the j(cid:5) are spherical Bessel functions and the P(cid:5)m are
associated Legendre polynomials. R is the distance from the
complex source/sink point (0, 0, ib) : R2 = ρ2 + (z − ib)2, and
we take

R = (z − ib)[1 + ρ2/(z − ib)2]1/2
(3)
in order to have R = z − ib along the beam axis ρ = 0. Near
the axis we have

dominant terms of all the members of the set (2); we note,
however, that only those with odd (cid:5) − m, for example

have ﬁnite normalization and energy integrals in the particle
and electromagnetic cases, respectively [8].

In this paper we will examine the phase and transport
velocities within beams, using as examples the approximate
and exact solutions (1) and (2). Please note the distinction
between the usual phase and group speeds, with magnitudes
ω/k and dω/dk respectively, and the velocities deﬁned here.
For our particle beam case, ω = ¯hk2/2m, so ω/k = ¯hk/2m,
dω/dk = ¯hk/m, and these would be constant throughout the
beam. In the electromagnetic case, with ω = ck in vacuum,
both phase and group speeds would be equal to the speed
of light c, everywhere in the beam. Instead we shall ﬁnd in
section 2 that

v p = ¯hk2
2m

for the particle beam with spatial phase P(r), and (in
section 3) that

v p = ck

∇ P
|∇ P|2

,

ve = 2c

E × B

E 2 + B 2

for the electromagnetic beam.
(Different ﬁeld components
may have different phases, and thus different phase velocities.)
We use the subscript e (for energy) since in the particle case
ve gives the velocity of transport of particles, and hence of
energy (each particle carries energy ¯h2k2/2m), and in the
electromagnetic case ve directly gives the velocity of transport
of energy. The term energy velocity was used by Brillouin [9,
section 20] in discussing the energy ﬂow from one cell to the
next in an atomic lattice. In waveguides, the power transmitted
through the guide divided by the ﬁeld energy per unit length
gives a ‘velocity of energy ﬂow’ [1, section 8.5]. This is an
average over the waveguide, whereas the energy velocity used
here is deﬁned at every point within the beam. The form of the
electromagnetic energy velocity as given in (8) is for Gaussian
units; in SI units it would be

ve = 2c2

E × B

E 2 + c2 B 2

(SI units).

(8(cid:2))

Some general results follow immediately from (7) and (8).
In the particle beam case, the phase and energy (particle
transport) velocities are everywhere parallel to each other, and
their product is equal to the constant (particle energy /particle
mass):

v p · ve = ν pνe = ¯h 2k2
2m2

.

For electromagnetic beams,
cannot exceed the speed of light, as expected:

Figure 1. Phase velocity: the total phase P(r) − ωt is constant on a

(10)

Note that the phase function P is a function of space, not of
time: we write the wavefunction(s) of the beam as ψ(r)e−iωt ,
with modulus M and phase P:

ψ(r) = M(r)eiP(r).

(11)

Thus both the phase and particle transport velocities are
independent of time in the particle beam, while only the phase
velocities are independent of time in the electromagnetic case,
in general. There exist steady beams, to be discussed in
section 4, for which the energy density, Poynting vector and
energy velocity are all independent of time, but these are a
special set. In general, all of these three quantities oscillate in
time about their mean values.

2. Phase and particle transport velocities, scalar
beams

We consider the phase velocity ﬁrst. The phase P(r) has
equiphase surfaces ﬁxed in space (see ﬁgure 1); the total phase
of the wavefunction is P(r) − ωt. In time dt the wavefront
moves from the P to the P + d P surfaces, in the direction
of ∇ P so the d P = |∇ P|dr = ω dt, since the total phase
function P − ωt is ﬁxed for a given wavefront.

Hence the phase speed is ω/|∇ P| and the phase velocity

is

v p =

ω∇ P
|∇ P|2

= ¯hk2
2m

∇ P
|∇ P|2

.

(12)

The above arguments are similar to those given in section 1.3.3
of [10], with the difference that we associate a direction (that
of ∇ P) with our v p, whereas Born and Wolf emphatically do
not with theirs, which is ω/|∇ P|: ‘the phase velocity does not
behave as a vector’ [10, p 19].

The particle transport velocity can be deﬁned in terms of
the probability current density (see, for example, [11, section
3.1])

By way of example, consider the beams represented by
ψG and ψ00 given in equations (1) and (2). We rewrite these
wavefunctions in terms of modulus and phase:

βξ − atn

ξ

sin 2βξ
e2βη − cos 2βξ

(cid:2)(cid:7)

.

The ψ(cid:5)m are expressed most simply in terms of oblate
spheroidal coordinates ξ and η [7, 8], since these are
respectively proportional to the real and imaginary parts of
the complex distance R given in (3):

R = (ξ −iη)b,

ρ2 = (1+ξ 2)(1−η2)b2,

The inverse relations are, with s2 = ρ2 + z2 − b2,

z = ξ ηb.
(17)

2b2ξ 2 = [s4+4b2z2]1/2+s2,

2b2η2 = [s4+4b2z2]1/2−s2.
(18)
On the beam axis ρ = 0 we have η = 1 and ξ = z/b. (Here
we take −∞ < ξ < ∞, 0 (cid:2) η (cid:2) 1, rather than the alternative
choice 0 (cid:2) ξ < ∞, −1 (cid:2) η (cid:2) 1 [12].) Finally, in (16) we
have set the dimensionless parameter kb equal to β.

The parameter β determines the divergence half-angle
of the beam: when b2 and ρ2 are much smaller than z2 the
exponent in the modulus of ψG tends to −βρ2/2z2, so the
beam amplitude falls to e−1 from its axial value at ρ2 = 2z2/β,
from which we see that the beam divergence half-angle is
)1/2. For the ψ(cid:5)m beams, the exponent in the
θ = atn( 2
β
modulus tends to the same function when β is large, so the same
divergence angle applies. For β small compared to unity, the
oscillatory term sin βξ = sin[kz + βρ2/[2(z2 + b2)] + O(ρ4)]
becomes as important as the hyperbolic term sinh βη =

those of ψ00 converge onto the zeros of ψ00, which lie on the circles

between 0 and π converge onto ρ1, those with P between π and 2π

Figure 2 shows surfaces of constant modulus for ψG and
ψ00, drawn for kb = β = 2 (i.e. for a beam divergence half-
angle of 45◦). Note the zeros of ψ00 in the focal plane, on the
ρ2 − b2 = nπ, n a positive integer. The equiphase
circles k
surfaces compared in ﬁgure 3 correspondingly converge (for
ψ00) onto these circles of zero modulus, where the phase is
undeﬁned. In contrast, the constant-phase surfaces of ψG go
off to inﬁnity.

ψG and (β/sinh β)ψ00, the factor β/ sinh β being inserted so
that both wavefunctions are normalized to unity at the origin
(which is the centre of the focal plane). In both cases the current

We note that the approximate Gaussian wavefunction fails for
small β(= kb): the current would go negative at the origin for
β < 1 and diverge to −∞ as β → 0. The ψ00 current is well
behaved as β → 0:

(The probability current density goes to zero with β since ψ00
for small β represents almost equal amounts of forward and
backward propagation.) At large β the currents at the origin
both tend to ¯hk/m, as one would expect from a broad beam
normalized to unity at the centre of its focal plane. Because
both ψG and (β/sinh β)ψ00 have unit modulus at the origin,
the energy velocity ve at the origin has the magnitude given
in (19) for the current J . The phase velocities at the origin
have magnitudes ν p = (¯hk/2m)(¯hk/mνe), i.e.

Again we see the failure of the approximate Gaussian beam
wavefunction, with divergence in the corresponding phase

velocity at β = 1. The ψ00 beam has ν p → 3
2 ¯h/mb for
β → 0 and ν p → ¯hk/2m for large β. Figures 5 and 6 show
the energy and phase velocity ﬁelds of ψG and ψ00.

The results for the beam wavefunction ψ10 given in (6)
are similar for large β but different at small β: the probability
current density of a beam normalized to unity at the origin
(i.e. with wavefunction ψ10/j1(−iβ)) is

m

β 3 cosh β sinh β −(β 2 − 2) cosh2 β −(β 2 + 2)
β[(β 2 − 1) cosh2 β + 1]

.

(22)
This tends to ¯h/mb as β tends to zero and to ¯hk/m for large β.
The energy velocity at the origin is also given by (22), since
the modulus is unity there. The phase velocity at the origin is,
from (9) or (12), ¯hk/2m times the reciprocal of the function
multiplying ¯hk/m in (22). The phase velocity thus tends to
¯hk2b/2m for small β and to ¯hk/2m for large β.

3. Phase and energy velocities for electromagnetic
beams

In the Lorentz gauge, and with all time dependence in the
factor e−iωt , the complex electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be
obtained in terms of spatial derivatives of the complex vector
potential [1, 8]

B(r) = ∇ × A(r),

E(r) = i
k

[∇(∇ · A(r)) + k2A(r)].
(23)

The real ﬁelds are, for example,

E(r, t) = Re{E(r)e−iωt } = 1
2

(cid:8)E(r)e−iωt + E∗(r)eiωt (cid:9).

(24)
In terms of the real ﬁelds, the energy density and Poynting
vector (which gives the energy ﬂow through unit area in unit
time) are given by

u = 1
8π

(E 2 + B 2),

S =

E × B.

(25)

c
4π

The corresponding expressions in terms of the complex ﬁelds,
averaged over one cycle, are

u = 1

16π [E(r) · E∗(r) + B(r) · B∗(r)]
16π [E(r) × B∗(r) + E∗(r) × B(r)].

S = c

(26)

(27)

Each component of A satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation (∇ 2 +
k2)ψ = 0, with k = ω/c. There are many possibilities for
beams, the simplest being A = (0, 0, A0ψ), which gives
the transverse-magnetic (TM) beam. When ψ is cylindrically
symmetric, as it is for our three examples ψG, ψ00 and ψ10, the
corresponding TM ﬁelds are

(29)

In general, each component of B and E will have its own
phase (and thus its own phase velocity) when the complex ﬁeld
component is written as a modulus times a phase factor, but
in the TM example above Bx and By share a common phase
function, as do Ex and E y. Thus there are three wavefronts

Phase and transport velocities in particle and electromagnetic beams

associated with a TM beam with cylindrical symmetry: those
of {Bx , By}, {Ex , E y} and Ez. For a given phase function P(r),
the phase velocity is

v p =

ω∇ P
|∇ P|2

= c

k∇ P
|∇ P|2

by the arguments given in section 2.

There is only one energy velocity ﬁeld: the energy ﬂux
is given by the Poynting vector S, and in free space this is
related to the energy density u by the conservation law (see,
for example, section 6.8 of [1])

We deﬁne the energy velocity by analogy with ﬂuid dynamics,
∂t + ∇ · (ρv) = 0, where ρ is
in which mass conservation is
the mass density and v is the velocity of ﬂuid ﬂow. Thus

∂ρ

.

In section 6.8 of [1] it is stated ‘since only its divergence
appears in the conservation law, the Poynting vector is arbitrary
to the extent that the curl of any vector ﬁeld can be added
to it. Such an added term can, however, have no physical
consequences’. We have taken the customary choices for
energy density and energy ﬂux, and have seen (in section 1)
that these choices lead to the satisfactory result that the energy
velocity in an electromagnetic ﬁeld cannot exceed c. The proof
of this result, in equations (10), would, however, fail if we
added the curl of a vector ﬁeld to E × B. We conclude that
we must of necessity omit such a term to retain the relativistic
requirement of νe (cid:2) c.

Both the energy ﬂux and the energy density oscillate about
their mean values S and u at angular frequency 2ω, except in
steady beams, to be discussed in the next section. Thus ve will
likewise oscillate about its mean value ve, in general. At each
point in space and time the magnitude of ve will not exceed
the speed of light, as we saw in section 1.

4. Steady beams

In all electromagnetic waves the ﬁelds E and B must oscillate
in time. There are, however, monochromatic beams, which
we shall call steady beams, in which E × B and E 2 + B 2 are
everywhere independent of time. A particular case was noted
in section 4 of [8]; here we shall generalize this idea. Let the
complex vector potential A(r) lead to the complex ﬁelds E(r )
and B(r) via (23). Then the dual potential (all components of
which also satisfy the Helmholtz equation)

A(cid:2) = (ik)−1∇ × A = (ik)−1B

(33)

leads to the ﬁelds
B(cid:2) = ∇ × A(cid:2) = (ik)−1∇ × B = −E

where we have used the source-free Maxwell equations ∇ ×
B − 1
∂E/∂t = 0 and ∇ · B = 0 in the ﬁrst and second parts
c
of (34), respectively. This is the simple duality transformation
E → B, B → −E (for the general transformation, see
section 6.12 of [1]) under which the Maxwell equations are
invariant. Now consider the vector potential A(cid:2)(cid:2) = A + iA(cid:2).
This gives the ﬁelds E(cid:2)(cid:2) = E + iB, B(cid:2)(cid:2) = B − iE, so that

E(cid:2)(cid:2) = iB(cid:2)(cid:2).

(35)

Likewise the combination A−iA(cid:2) leads to E(cid:2)(cid:2) = −iB(cid:2)(cid:2). Fields
for which (35) is true have (we drop the double primes)
B(r, t) = Re{B(r)e−iωt }

= Br sin ωt − Bi cos ωt

Both phases are zero in the focal plane z = 0. Note the marked
difference in phase value and in curvature when β = 2. For β (cid:11) 1
and z2 (cid:12) b2, PE ≈ P, on the beam axis.

where Br (r) and Bi (r) are the real and imaginary parts of the
complex ﬁeld B(r), and Er = −Bi , Ei = Br . The resulting

(when E = −iB, S becomes (c/4π)Bi × Br ).

The ‘steady beams’ thus have A ± k−1∇ × A as a
vector potential (where each component of A must satisfy the
Helmholtz equation), electric and magnetic ﬁelds which are
in phase quadrature and equal in magnitude (E = ±iB), and
time-independent energy density and ﬂux.

The relations E = ±iB are necessary as well as sufﬁcient
for the time independence of the energy ﬂux and energy
density:

not apply.)

We note that, when E = ±iB, both E and B are

eigenstates of curl, with eigenvalue ±k:

∇ × B = ±kB

∇ × E = ±kE

(40)

(or ∇ × Br = ±kBr, ∇ × Bi = ±kBi, etc). These
relations follow by substituting E = ±iB or equivalently
{Er = ∓Bi, Ei = ±Br } into the Maxwell curl equations.

5. TE beam phases, wavefront curvatures and phase
velocities

We shall now calculate the phases, phase velocities and energy
velocities of the azimuthally symmetric TE and ‘TEM’ beams,
beginning with the transverse electric beam. This has electric
ﬁeld lines which are circles concentric with the beam axis [8,
section 4]:

Figure 8. On-axis curvature κ0(z)/k of the phase surfaces of ψ00,
drawn for β = 0–5. The limiting form as β → 0 is given by the last
line of equation (51).

The curvature of the equiphase surfaces is important in the
design of laser resonators [13, 14]. On a given cylindrically
symmetric equiphase surface P = constant, the distance from
the axis ρ is a known function of z, and the curvature of the
surface is given by the well-known formula

κ(ρ, z) =

d2ρ/dz2
[1 + (dρ/dz)2]3/2

The derivatives of ρ with respect to z can be expressed in terms
of partial derivatives of the phase function (compare section 4

For comparison,
the on-axis curvature of the equiphase
surfaces of the Gaussian beam ψG is z/(b2 + z2 − b/k), which
agrees with the curvature of the ψ00 phase when β = kb (cid:11) 1.
We see from the last expression in (51) that κ0(z) has a
functional form as β → 0 which is well behaved in the
focal region: κ0/k → ( 2

written as k2z/(cid:8)β 2 + (kz)2 − β(cid:9), becomes inﬁnite at (kz)2 =
β(1 − β) and tends to z−1 as β → 0.

The curvature κ0(z) is shown in ﬁgure 8 for several values
of β, including its limiting form as β → 0. The β = 0 function
has extrema at kz = ±π, and has zero slope at kz/π equal to
positive or negative integers.

We now turn to the phase function PE of the transverse
electric ﬁeld components, given by (44) and (45). The on-axis
curvature is more complicated than that of the phase function
P, but is in agreement with it for large β:

There are therefore three families of equiphase surfaces,
one each for Bx , By and Bz (the equiphase surfaces of the
components of E are related to those of B by a constant shift
of π/2 in the phase values). Of these, the surfaces for Bx and
By depend on the azimuthal angle; those for Bz do not.

6. The ‘TEM’ energy ﬂux and energy velocity

For the ‘TEM’ steady beam the complex ﬁelds are given
by (55) and (56) with E = iB. The energy density u and
energy ﬂux S are both independent of time. The steady beam
expressions (37) for u and S in terms of Br and Bi can be
rewritten as

The ‘TEM’ beam energy density for the ψ00 wavefunction
is shown in ﬁgure 10 and the energy ﬂux is shown in ﬁgure 11.
We see that the energy density is non-zero on the beam axis
ρ = 0, whereas E × B is zero on the axis. This is because B
and E both have only longitudinal components on the beam
axis, since both Bx and By are zero there (see (56) and (60)).
Thus the beam is hollow in energy ﬂux and momentum density,
and the energy velocity ve = S/u is zero on the beam axis:
there is energy on the axis, but it is not moving. Figure 12
shows the energy velocity ﬁeld of the ψ00 ‘TEM’ beam.

magnitude. Up to six different sets of equiphase surfaces can
exist in an electromagnetic beam. As a function of time, up
to six sets of wavefronts are propagating, at various speeds
and in various directions. Since the curvature of the mirrors
bounding resonant laser cavities is matched with the curvature
of the wavefront, one should know which wavefront is the
relevant one. Presumably it is that of the transverse electric
ﬁeld components, but the literature appears to be silent on this
question. As we saw in section 5, the curvatures of the various
wavefronts can be very different when kb and kz are both small.
In conclusion, we remark on the perhaps surprising
result that orthodox wave optics leads us to predict that
electromagnetic energy can travel in free space at less than
the speed of light, and that it can even stand still in parts of
some propagating beams.

7. Discussion

We have seen that the phase and particle transport velocities
for focused beams can differ markedly from the broad-beam
values ¯hk/2m and ¯hk/m, respectively. For example, when
β = 2, at the centre of the focal plane of the ψ00 beam the phase
velocity is 1.86(¯hk/2m) and the particle transport velocity is
(¯hk/m)/1.86. For the ψG and ψ10 beams the multiplier 1.86
is replaced by 2 and 1.16, respectively. Recent developments
in helium atom beam focusing using Fresnel zone plates [17]
may provide the techniques to test these predictions.

In electromagnetic beams the energy velocity never

the case of the ’TEM’ beam where the energy ﬂux is zero
on the beam axis, but the energy density is not. The phase
velocities can be larger than the speed of light: this corresponds
to the effective wavelength 2π/|∇ P| being larger than 2π/k
(i.e. |∇ P| < k). The phase velocities, one each for the
components of E and B, where these components differ
in the form of the phase function P(r), are independent of
time. The energy velocity in general oscillates about its mean
value at angular frequency 2ω, except in the case of steady
beams, for which the energy ﬂux, energy density and energy
velocity are all independent of time. It is interesting that the
phase velocities of the various components of the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds can differ from each other in direction and in

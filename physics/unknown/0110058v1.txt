In  a  recent  paper,  Harada  and  Sachs  suggested  that  the  Fitzgerald-Lorentz  contraction  does  not  refer  to  a 

physical  contraction,  but  can  perhaps  be  better  understood  by  comparing  it  to  the  conversion  of  currency 

between different coutries; e.g. the conversion between the Japanese yen in the US dollar and vice versa. In the 

present paper, this interpretation of the Fitzgerald-lorentz contraction will be inspected further. 

Key words: Special Relativity, Einstein, Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction, Multiple Observers.

I.Introduction. 

The  special  theory  of  relativity  (STR)  is  a  well-established  theory  which  nevertheless  predicts  some counter-

intuitive  effects.  One  of  those  counter-intuitive effects is the change of size of objects moving with a certain 

velocity  relative  to  each  other.  Mathematically,  this  change  in  size  is  related  to  the  Lorentz  transformation  of 

coordinates  of  an  observer in space-time. The difficulty with this contraction is its physical interpretation. The 

main  question  is  whether  an  object  actually  changes  in  size  when  it  moves  relative  to  a  relatively  stationary 

observer. Because in STR space and time are treated on equal footing, this question also is relavant to the twin-

paradox and its physical interpretation (A.D. Allan1). 

In  their  paper,  Harada  and  Sachs2  propose  to  treat  the  Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction similar to the change in 

currency  between  the  money  system  of  two  different  coutries.  This  point  is  inspected  by  making  use  of  two 

observers.  In  the  present  paper,  a  number  of  observers  are  employed  and  the  interpretation  is  inspected  on 

consistency. The conclusions reached are to the opinion of the author independent of a type of interpretation. 

In the interpretation of Harada and Sachs, a difference is made between a unit length at relative rest and a unit 

length  in  relative  motion.  Suppose  we  inspect  the  situation  for  an  arbitrary observer, Ok. In the view of Ok we

Here, Lk is the unit of length at rest in Ok's frame of reference, while, b kj=vkj/c, is the (normed) velocity of observer

specific, when Ok wants to measure length in Oj's units, -who moves with b kj relative to Ok-, he has to make use of 
the (currency) conversion, (1-b 2

kj)1/2. The observer, Oj, measures with Lj, but Ok has to use, Lkj, as 'currency'.

Introducing more than two observers, Ok and Oj, we may introduce observer Oi and note that, Lk=Lki(1-b 2

In  addition  to  the  Ok  'point  of  view'  we  may  also  employ  the  Oj 'point of view'. In this case we write, Lj=Lj k(1-

j k)1/2, where Lj is the unit of length at rest in Oj's frame, b

j k the velocity of Oj relative Ok  and, Lj k the 'currency' of 

Oj when he wants to measure in Ok's unit.  

Because, b

j k=b kj, we only may have, Lj k=Lkj, when, Lj=Lk.  

Furthermore, let us state that Lj is unequal to Lk, (|Lj-Lk|>0) and introduce additional observers, Op, Oq and Or. In 
this case we may write, Lp=Lpq(1-b 2

III.Conclusion and discussion. 

In  this  paper,  we  arrived  at  a  contradiction  when  we  started  with  a  particular  interpretation  of  the  Fitzgerald-

Lorentz  contraction.  The  contradiction  appears  to  be  too  straightforward to be dependent on a single specific 

interpretation. The possibility of the unearthed contradiction is demonstrated with a numercial study. E.g. given 

b kj=0.1438, b ki=0.8833, together with, b pr=0.0363, b pq=0.8808, we have within good approximation,b ki;j=b pq;r. Starting 

from Lk=1, we see that with the previous parameters, Lkj=1.0105, Lki=2.1329, together with, Lpr=1.0098, Lpq=2.1329, 

such that within good approximation, (Lpr/Lpq)=(Lkj/Lki). Given this, we find that, Lj=0.9993. 

 
Moreover, an alternative route is to note that Lp=Lj k(1-b 2

pr)1/2, leads to 

Moreover, Lp=Lki(1-b 2

pq)1/2, leading to 

From the previous two expressions we find that,

such that when, b pq;r=b ki;j, it easily follows that, Lj k=Lkj, despite Lj unequal to Lk.  

Physically, the contradiction can, for instance, occur in the  field of relativistic gas dynamics 3 or, more generally, 

in relativistic hydrodynamics 4. Here, the 'unit of length at rest' can be related to 'the radius of the particles at rest' 

that make up the gas. We may have, Lp, for the radius of Op particles, Lj, for Oj particles and Lk, for Ok particles. 

If, on the other hand, the contradiction does not occur in the physical reality of, for instance, a relativistic gas, 

there has to be an implicit physical reason why b pq;r cannot be equal to b ki;j for unequal mutual velocities; b kj„
b ki„

b pr, 
b pq.  The  question  then  arises  which  kind  of  physical  interaction  we  are  dealing  with,  beacuse  the 

contradiction is valid, even for an ideal gas.

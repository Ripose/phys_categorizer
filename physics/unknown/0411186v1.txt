Abstract:  The  article  describes  research  of  fluid  flow  inside  an  axial-flow  pump  that  includes 
guide  vanes,  impeller  and  discharge  diffuser.  Three  impellers  with  different  hub  ratio  were 
researched. The article presents the performance curves and velocity distributions behind each of 
the  impeller  obtained  by  computational  and  experimental  ways  at  six  different  capacities.  The 
velocity  distributions  behind  the  detached  guide  vanes  of  different  hub  ratio  are  also  presented. 
The  computational  results  were  obtained using  the  software  tools  CFX-BladeGenPlus  and  CFX-
TASCflow.  The  experimental  performance  curves  were  obtained  using  the  standard  procedure. 
The  experimental  velocity  distributions  were  obtained  by  probing  of  the  flow.  Good 
correspondence of results, both for performance curves and velocity distributions, was obtained for 
most of the considered cases. 
As  it  was demonstrated,  the performance  curves of  the  pump  depend  essentially  on  the  impeller 
hub ratio. Velocity distributions behind the impeller depend strongly on the impeller hub ratio and 
capacity. Conclusions concerning these dependencies are drawn. 
Keywords:  axial-flow  pump,  guide  vanes,  impeller,  performance  curves,  velocity  distributions,

1. Introduction 

 
Axial-flow  submersible  pumps  are  widely  used  in  Ukraine,  in  particular,  as  units  of 
pump stations for land iggiration and drainage. Nowadays, these stations  are completed 
with  imported  pumps,  as  Ukrainian  enterprises  do  not  produce  such  pumps.  In  USSR, 
such  pumps  were  developed  30  years  ago  and  were  produced  by  the  factories 
“Uralhydromash”  (Russia)  and  “Moldavhydromash”  (Moldova).  Quality  of  their  design 
does not correspond to the modern scientific and technical level. 

Taking  into  account  large  industrial,  scientific  and  technical  potential  of  Ukraine,  it 
would be expedient to organize here own production of such pumps. With this purpose, 
the  research  was  conducted  at  the  department  of  applied  fluid  mechanics,  resulted  in 
creation of a perfected design scheme of such pumps named GV – IMP (guide vanes – 
impeller)  [1].  As  it  was  shown  [2],  the  created  pumps  have  lower  production  costs, 
require lower maintenance expenses and, at the same time, ensure larger efficiency. And 
as the pumps of this type are often of large power, efficiency is one of the most important 
criteria of their perfection. 

A new scientific idea implemented in design of these pumps is creation of pre-swirl at 
the  entrance  to  impeller,  opposite  to  shaft  rotation,  using  guide  vanes  (these  vanes  are 

2

simultaneously the supports of the engine capsule). As it was found out [3], presence of 
pre-swirl upstream of the impeller influences significantly the performance curves of the 
pump, by changing its shape and width of working capacity range. 

This  article  presents  the  results  of  further  experimental  researches  aimed  at  study  of 
influence of geometrical parameters of hydraulic components of the pump upon the flow 
pattern  inside  it  and  its  performance  curves.  This  will  permit,  in  particular,  to  find  out 
minimum hub ratio behind the guide vanes that doesn’t cause reverse flow near the hub 
and find out impeller hub ratio that corresponds to the highest pump efficiency. 

For  performing  the  computational  research,  we  have  chosen  the  software  package 
CFX-TASCflow  (http://www-waterloo.ansys.com/cfx/),  as  according  to  the  review  [4], 
this  package  is  one  of  the  most  respected  CFD  tools  for  simulation  of  fluid  flows  in 
hydraulic machinery. As for the experimental research, performance curves of the pump 
were  obtained  using  the  standard  procedure.  Besides,  we  have  probed  the  flow 
downstream  of  the  impeller  with  a  5-channel  probe  at  different  capacities,  thus  having 
obtained experimental distributions of velocities at different modes of pump operation. 

2. Description of the experimental research 

 
Object of research. For performing the research, a model pump was designed, which 
hydraulic  components  are  presented  at  Fig.  1.  Those  hydraulic  components  were  guide 
vanes, impeller and discharge conical diffuser. 

Guide vanes (Fig. 2) include five cylindrical vanes of 4 mm in thickness, with plane 
initial section of 15 mm in length. Radius of cylindrical surface used for shaping a vane 
was  60  mm,  spanning  angle  was  84°,  i.e.,  the  inlet  edge  of  each  vane  was  installed 
streamwise, whereas the outlet edge was almost perpendicular to the flow. 

Diameter  of  each  impeller  was  180  mm.  Each  of  tested  impellers  had  4  blades 
designed  according  to  the  method  of  Voznesensky  –  Pekin  [5]  for  conditions  of  axial 
outflow and constant velocity moment of flow upstream of impeller. Impellers differed by 
the hub ratio đhub – 0.5, 0.39 and 0.28 correspondingly. First two impellers were designed 
basing  upon  the  meridional  projection  for  the  first  impeller  and,  thus,  had  equal  blade 
profiles. The third impeller was designed basing upon its own meridional projection. 

Discharge diffuser was conical in shape and had area ratio of 1.72 and internal angle 
of  24°.  According  to  the  results  of  the  paper  [6],  the  losses  in  the  discharge  diffuser  of 
this pump are minimal just with this internal angle.

Methods of research. Performance curves of the pump were obtained by standard test 
procedure. The flow pattern downstream of impeller was probed using a 5-channel probe. 
The section of probing was located just behind the impeller blades (Fig. 1). Difference in 
capacity measured with a diaphragm and computed using the results of probing did not 
exceed  6%.  Description  of  the  probing  procedure  and  formulas  for  computation  of 
capacity are presented in [7]. 

3. Description of the computational research 

 
For performing the computational research, we have used the software package CFX-
TASCflow.  The  general  sequence  of  actions  and  separate  software  tools  are  described 
below. 

CFX-BladeGen. For creation of solid models of hydraulic components, we have used 
the software tool CFX-BladeGen. The models of guide vanes and impeller (together with 
the  discharge  diffuser)  were  created  separately.  The  interface  of  CFX-BladeGen  has 
allowed for input conveniently of all the data from the theoretical drawing of an impeller. 
Impeller  blades  were  specified  by  a  set  of  drawing  views  of  profiles.  Each  profile  was 
obtained at sections of a blade by cylindrical surfaces of different radius. The window of 
CFX-BladeGen is presented at Fig. 3. 

CFX-BladeGenPlus. After creation of solid models of guide vanes and impellers, we 
have  computed  flow  field  inside  these  components  using  the  software  tool  CFX-
BladeGenPlus.  This  software  tool  is  featured  with  easy  understandable  interface 
convenient for an engineer without special knowledge in the CFD. 

Before  computation  of  flow 

in  CFX-BladeGenPlus,  unstructured  mesh  with 
tetrahedron  cells  is  generated.  We  used  the  meshes  containing  about  240  000  cells.  As 
source  data,  fluid  properties,  capacity,  rotational  speed  and  inlet  velocity  profiles  were 
specified. When computing the flow though guide vanes, we assumed that the upstream 
flow does not swirl and is of constant velocity though the inlet section. When computing 
the flow through impellers, we specified at the inlet the velocity distributions obtained by 
probing  the  flow  behind  guide  vanes  (to  be  more  exact,  behind  the  impeller  with  the 
blades removed – these distributions are presented at Fig. 5). 

As  a  result  of  computation,  we  obtained  the  distribution  of  velocities  and  pressure 
through  the  whole  space  inside  the  hydraulic  component.  We  obtained  also  the  integral 
parameters  of  flow:  axial  force  and  torque  imposed  on  blades,  loss  factor  (for  guide 
vanes), as well as head, consumed power and efficiency (for impellers). The formulas for 
computing these parameters are editable by a user. 

Note,  however,  that  the  software  tool  CFX-BladeGenPlus,  being  a  very  convenient 
tool  for  express  analysis  of  flow,  has  restricted  possibilities.  This  tool  is  designed  for 
computation  of  flow  in  detached  hydraulic  components,  not  allowing  for  simulation  of 
flow in the whole flow passage. In this tool, only an algebraic eddy-viscosity turbulence 

model is implemented, which is too simplified approach for complex flows. Besides, this 
tool  does  not  allow  for  simulation  of  flows  with  several  phases,  heat  transfer  and  other 
effects  that  require  additional  model  equations.  For  such  problems,  CFX-TASCflow 
should be used.

In the window, the geometrical model of the impeller with hub ratio of 0.39 is presented.  
The dependencies below (blade angles and blade thickness vs. distance along the blade chord)  
relate to the profile located at the hub. 

 
CFX-TurboGrid.  Before  computation  of  flow  in  CFX-TASCflow,  computational 
mesh  should  be  generated.  A  convenient  tool  for  generating  the  mesh  in  the  bladed 
components is the software tool CFX-TurboGrid. As source data, this tool takes the files 
created in CFX-BladeGen, and saves the generated mesh in the format required for CFX-
TASCflow. CFX-TurboGrid generates structured meshes with hexahedron cells. 

The computational domain that corresponds to a separate hydraulic component (guide 
vanes  or  impeller)  is  split  into  blocks  (sub-domains),  according  to  the  topology  of 
splitting selected by user. After selection of the topology, the user corrects manually the 
position  of  sub-domains,  laws  of  node  distribution  along  grid  lines,  position  of  control 
points,  according  to  the  recommendations  described  in  the  user  manual  of  CFX-
TurboGrid  [8].  Each  of  the  topologies  implemented  in  CFX-TurboGrid  [8]  suits  mostly 
for  a  certain  class  of  bladed  components,  providing  the  possibility  to  generate  high-
quality computational mesh with minimal skew of cells. 

In this research, we used the following grid topologies: for guide vanes – High Stagger 
Blade  Template,  for  impellers  –  Single  Block  Grid  Template.  The  obtained  meshes  are 
presented at the Fig. 4. 

Diagnostics  of  the  generated  mesh  for  the  guide  vanes:  total  number  of  cells  is  120 
000,  minimal  angle  is  20.0°,  maximal  angle  is  163.8°.  The  mesh  for  the  impeller  with 
đhub = 0.39:  total  number  of  cells  is  130  000,  minimal  angle  is  24.2°,  maximal  angle  is 

5

 

 

 

 

156.4°. Thus, the quality of generated meshes is good enough for running the numerical 
simulation. 

Figure 4. Computational mesh for guide vanes (left-hand side) and impeller (right-hand side) – 
for clearness, only the grid at medium flow surface in one of blade-to-blade channels is shown 

 
CFX-TASCflow. For subsequent actions, the software tool CFX-TASCflow was used. 
Firstly, we need to compose the integral computational domain from the separate sub-
domains  that  correspond  to  guide  vanes  and  impeller  (together  with  the  discharge 
diffuser). The corresponding computational meshes generated by CFX-TurboGrid (Fig. 4) 
are  joined  thus  forming  the  united  computational  mesh.  At  the  interface  between  guide 
vanes and impeller, we used the condition of Stage Averaging [4, 9]. Thus, at this surface, 
the parameters of flow were averaged in the circumferential direction. 

In  this  research,  we  used  k  –  ε  turbulence  model  with  scalable  wall  functions.  The 

description of this model and further references are presented, e.g., in [4] and [9]. 

As the source data for running the simulation, like as in CFX-BladeGenPlus, capacity, 
rotational  speed  and  fluid  properties  were  specified.  The  flow  upstream  of  guide  vanes 
was assumed non-swirling, of constant velocity through the inlet section. For turbulence 
model equations, medium level of turbulence was specified at the inlet (though, variation 
of this parameter in the wide range almost did not tell upon the results of computation). 
Zero  wall  roughness  for  the  whole  flow  passage  was  specified.  For  simplicity,  the  gap 
between impeller blades and stator walls was assumed to be zero. 

4. Results of probing of flow behind the guide vanes 

 
Figure  5  presents  comparison  of  velocity  distributions  in  the  section  behind  guide 
vanes obtained numerically with CFX-BladeGenPlus and experimentally by probing (the 
section of probing was the same, only impeller blades were removed). The experimental 
results  of  Fig.  5  were  earlier  published  in  the  paper  [10].  Distributions  of  axial  Vz  and 
circumferential  Vu  velocity  are  given  as  ratio  to  the  average  (through  the  section)  axial 
velocity. 

As one can see, no separation of flow is observed for all the hub ratios investigated. 
Distribution of circumferential velocity corresponds approximately to the law of constant 
velocity moment, Vu r = const. The numerical and experimental velocity profiles coincide 
qualitatively, though with some quantitative discrepancy. The swirl intensity obtained by

In  order  to  check  grid  independence  of  the  solution,  this  flow  was  computed  using 
meshes of 120 000, 240 000 and 480 000 cells. The maximum difference in local values 
of velocities did not exceed 5% from the axial velocity average through the section.

Dependence  of  theoretic  head  of  the  impeller  on  capacity.  As  the  tool  CFX-
BladeGenPlus  allows  for  flow  simulation  only  in  detached  components,  we  provide 
comparison with the experimental results by the theoretic head produced by an impeller. 
Theoretic head is the head divided by hydraulic efficiency.

the  investigated  range  of  capacity  was  10%,  the  maximal  divergence  was  about  20%.

Performance  curves  of 

the  pump.  These  curves  obtained  numerically  and 
experimentally  for  the  whole  flow  passage  of  the  pump  are  presented  at  Fig.  7. 
Computation  of  flow  using  CFX-TASCflow  was  performed  for  the  same  capacities  at 
which probing of flow was performed. As one can see, for the whole investigated range 
of capacities, the performance curves correspond with each other qualitatively quite well, 
and in most cases, good quantitative correspondence is also observed. 

Fig. 7 presents also the dependence of impeller efficiency on capacity obtained with 
CFX-BladeGenPlus. The obtained values of efficiency are believable and agree well with 
the impeller efficiencies obtained using CFX-TASCflow (not shown). 

As  for  the  performance  curves,  the  following  may  be  observed.  As  the  capacity  of 
pump increases, the head decreases, and the power increases, as is typical for radial-flow 
pumps. The larger is the impeller hub ratio, the more extended are performance curves of 
the  pump  along  capacity  axis.  The  largest  efficiency  was  obtained  for  the  impeller  hub 
ratio of 0.39, however, in this case, capacity range with high level of efficiency was the 
narrowest.  The  largest  consumed  power  was  also  obtained  for  the  impeller  hub  ratio  of 
0.39.

■ – impeller hub ratio of 0.5, ● – 0.39, ▲ – 0.28; blank markers – computation, CFX-TASCflow;  
pale line – impeller efficiency, computation, CFX-BladeGenPlus 

 

Maximum  efficiency  achieved  with  each  of  these  impellers,  according  to  the 
experimental results, is 70%, 73% and 67%, and according to the computational results, is 
68%, 67% and 62% correspondingly. According to the experiment, maximum efficiency 
for the impeller with đhub = 0.5 is reached at the mode 3, for the impeller with đhub = 0.39 
– at the mode 4 and for the impeller with đhub = 0.28 – at the mode 5. According to the 
computation, maximum efficiency for each impeller is reached at the mode 5. 

Bladed components of this pump are designed in such a way that behind the impeller 
it  would  be  no  swirl  at  the  nominal  capacity.  While  passing  between  guide  vanes,  the 
flow obtains large negative swirl, of approximately constant velocity moment through the 
section.  As  the  flow  passes  though  impeller,  its  velocity  moment  changes  to zero.  As  a 
result of this, the head is created. 

At the capacities above nominal, the flow after passing though the impeller keeps its 
negative swirl and, thus, it swirls downstream in the direction opposite to shaft rotation. 
At the capacities below nominal, the flow after passing though the impeller gets positive 
swirl  and,  thus,  it  swirls  downstream  in  the  same  direction  as  the  shaft.  Corresponding 
flow patterns in absolute frame of reference obtained with CFX-TASCflow are shown at 
Fig. 8. The more the capacity differs from the nominal, the larger is swirl in the discharge 
diffuser.

Velocity  distributions  behind 

the 

impeller.  These  distributions  obtained  by 
computation  using  CFX-TASCflow  and  by  probing  of  flow  are  presented  at  Fig.  9. 
Distributions  of  axial  Vz  and  circumferential  Vu  velocity  for  each  impeller  are  given  as 
ratio  to  the  average  (through  the  section)  axial  velocity  at  the  nominal  capacity  for  the 
same impeller. Non-dimensional circumferential velocity at the hub rotating together with 
impeller, for the mentioned impellers, is 1.31, 1.21 and 1.12 correspondingly. 

Experimental results of Fig. 9 at the modes 2, 3 and 4 were earlier published in [10]. 
As may be seen, the results obtained with CFX-TASCflow, in general, coincide with the 
experimental results quite well, with proper reflection of changes in velocity distributions 
at  different  capacities.  The  quantitative  correspondence  of  results  is  also  rather  good. 
Significant  discrepancies  are  observed  mostly  for  the  impeller  with  đhub  =  0.28  and  for 
very low capacities, as strong swirl present in the flow passage in these cases is difficult 
to be simulated properly and requires advanced turbulence modeling. 

The following effects are peculiar to these distributions. 
Mode 1. Large residual swirl created by guide vanes is available. The flow is pressed 
to  the  periphery,  especially  distinctly  behind  the  impeller  with  đhub  =  0.28,  where  large 
stagnation region is observed near the hub.

Figure 9. Distributions of axial (left-hand side) and circumferential (right-hand side) velocity component  
behind the impeller: experiment – ■ – impeller hub ratio of 0.5, ● – 0.39, ▲ – 0.28  
(thin lines are for visual aid only); dashed line – computation, CFX-TASCflow 

 
Mode  2.  At  this  mode,  the  flow  swirled  by  guide  vanes  is  also  not  completely  de-
swirled  after  passing  the  impeller.  For  each  of  impellers,  the  circumferential  velocity 
Vu < 0. Axial velocity distribution behind each of three impellers is distinctly pressed to 
the  periphery.  Behind  the  impeller  with  đhub  =  0.5,  it  is  the  most  uniform  through  the 
section, and behind the impeller with đhub = 0.28, it is the most deformed. 

Mode 3. At this mode, the swirl of flow behind the impeller is the closest to zero. Peak 
of the axial velocity observed at the previous mode here is less distinct. On the other side, 
peak of the axial velocity near the hub is observed. It is most distinct behind the impeller 
with đhub = 0.5 and merely observable (according to the experimental results) behind the 
impeller with đhub = 0.28. 

Mode 4. At this mode, the flow swirled by guide vanes is re-swirled after passing the 
impeller in the direction of shaft rotation. For each of three impellers, the circumferential 
velocity Vu > 0. Peak of axial velocity at the periphery is completely smoothed away at 
this mode behind the impeller with đhub = 0.5 (according to the experimental results) but 
is  still  distinctly  expressed  behind  the  impeller  with  đhub  =  0.28.  The  flow  behind  the 
impeller  with  đhub  =  0.5  is  strongly  pressed  to  the  hub.  The  stagnation  zone  behind  the 
impeller with đhub = 0.28 that was observed near the hub at the previous modes, now is 
absent  (though  this  fact  is  not  confirmed  by  computation).  Behind  the  impeller  with 
đhub = 0.39,  peaks  of  axial  velocity  at  the periphery and  near  the  hub  are  approximately 
equal (according to the computation, tendency for alignment of peaks is observed). 

Mode  5.  Large  swirl  of  flow  in  the  direction  of  shaft  rotation  is  available. 
Circumferential  velocity  is  almost  constant  through  the  section.  In  the  axial  velocity 
distribution, a  sharply  expressed  peak  near  the  hub  is  available  (except  for  the  impeller 
with đhub = 0.28).

Mode  6.  In  comparison  with  the  previous  mode,  the  intensity  of  flow  swirl  has 
strengthened.  Distributions  of  both  axial  and  circumferential  velocities  have  essentially 
changed and pressed to the periphery. Flow pattern has become similar to the solid body 
type of rotation. 

Note, at the head curve of the pumps (Fig. 6), between the modes 5 and 6, a “pit” is 
available (capacity range featuring with reduced head and unstable flow inside the pump). 
Presence  of  the  “pit”  can  seemingly  be  explained  by  restructuring  of  flow  inside  the 
pump.  At  the  capacities  to  the  right  from  the  “pit”,  the  axial  velocity  distribution  is 
pressed  to  the  hub,  so  as  at  the  capacities  to  the  left  from  the  “pit”  it  is  pressed  to  the 
periphery.  Further  downstream,  the  axial  velocity  distribution  is  gradually  smoothed 
approaching  finally  logarithmic  shape  typical  for  developed  turbulent  flow  in  a  pipe. 
Process  of  smoothing  of  the  velocity  distribution  may  be  imagined  as  superposition  of 
flow of constant (through the section) velocity and vortex flow which decelerates rapidly 
moving  fluid  layers  and  accelerates  slowly  moving  fluid  layers  (Fig.  10).  In  this 
representation, when the mode of pump operation changes from 5 to 6, this vortex (that 
smoothes the axial velocity distribution downstream of impeller) changes the direction of 
rotation (considering the meridional projection of the pump). Here is the explanation of 
instability  of  pump  operation  at  the  capacities  within  the  “pit”:  this  vortex  rotates 
sometimes in one direction, sometimes in the opposite direction. 

Figure 10. Scheme of flow behind the impeller at the mode 6  
(left-hand side – to the left from the “pit”) and 5 (right-hand side – to the right from the “pit”);  
the dark figures represent distributions of the axial velocity 

 
In the impeller with đhub = 0.28, the fluid flow is pressed to the periphery in the whole 
capacity  range  (Fig.  9).  Correspondingly,  at  the  head  curve  of  the  pump  with  this 
impeller, there is no “pit” (Fig. 7). 

6. Conclusions 

 
As  a  result  of  this  research,  good  correspondence  of  computational  results  obtained 
using  the  software  package  CFX  with  experimental  results  was  observed,  except  for 
strongly swirled flows. Namely, with CFX-BladeGenPlus the performance curves of the 
pump and velocity distribution behind the guide vanes were agreed, with CFX-TASCflow 
– the performance curves and velocity distribution behind the impellers. 

The following conclusions can be also drawn: 

-  When hub ratio behind the guide vanes of this design is 0.28, the reverse flow behind 

the guide vanes is still absent. 

-  Flow  swirl  behind  the  impeller  depends  strongly  on  the  capacity  of  pump.  At 
capacities  above  nominal,  the  residual  swirl  generated  by  guide  vanes  is  available 
behind  the  impeller.  At  low  capacities,  the  impeller  forces  the  flow  to  swirl  in  the 
direction of shaft rotation. 

-  Distribution of the axial velocity behind the impeller also depends significantly on the 
capacity.  At  high  capacities,  fluid  flow  is  pressed  to  the  periphery.  As  the  capacity 
decreases  till  the  mode  to  the  right  from  the  “pit”  on  the  head  curve,  the  flow  is 

16

 

 

gradually depressed from the periphery and pressed to the hub. At very low capacities 
(to the left from the “pit”), the flow is strongly pressed to the periphery. 

-  Distribution of the axial velocity behind the impeller also depends on the impeller hub 
ratio. At the hub ratio of 0.28, the flow is pressed to the periphery in the whole range 
of capacities. 

-  Shape  of  performance  curves  obtained  in  this  axial-flow  pump  with  large  negative 
inlet  swirl  is  typical  for  radial-flow  pumps  (as  the  capacity  increases,  the  head 
decreases and the power increases). 

-  As the impeller hub ratio increases, its performance curves extend along the capacity 

axis. 

-  The  highest  efficiency  (experiment  –  73%,  computation  –  68%)  was  reached  at  the 
impeller hub ratio of 0.39 (experiment; computation – 0.5). However, in this case, the 
range of capacities of high efficiency was the narrowest. 

-  The  largest  consumed  power  was  also  observed  at  the  impeller  hub  ratio  of  0.39 

- 

(experiment; computation – 0.5). 
In the pumps with impeller hub ratios of 0.5 and 0.39, a distinctly expressed “pit” was 
observed  at  performance  curves.  At  the  impeller  hub  ratio  of  0.28,  this  “pit”  was 
absent. 

-  According  to  the  experiment,  in  the  pump  with  the  impeller  hub  ratio  of  0.5,  the 
highest efficiency was reached at approximately zero swirl behind the impeller. At the 
hub ratio of 0.28, the highest efficiency was obtained at large positive swirl behind the 
impeller, i.e., at a significantly lower capacity. According to the results of computation 
with  CFX-TASCflow,  for  each  of  impellers  the  highest  efficiency  was  reached  at 
rather large positive swirl behind the impeller.

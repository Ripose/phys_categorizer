In  1934  two  important  discoveries  were  made  in  Rome:  at  the  beginning  of  March, 

while  FrØdØric  Joliot  and  his  wife  IrŁne  Curie  had  already  observed  in  Paris  the 
artificial radioactivity induced by α-particles, Enrico Fermi realised that also neutrons 

could  be  used  to  induce  radioactivity;  in  fact,  in  spite  of  the  weak  intensity  of  the 

sources  available  at  that  time,  electrical  neutrality  allowed  these  particles  to  approach 

the nucleus much closer than alphas did, and, if compared to the latter, passed through 

much thicker layers of matter. 

Experiments  carried  out  in  Rome  brilliantly  confirmed  the  expectations,  and  Lord 

Ernest Rutherford personally complimented on them with these words: 

Dear  Fermi,  [(cid:133)]  your  results  are  of  great  interest  [(cid:133)].  I  congratulate  you  on  your 

successful  escape  from  the  sphere  of  theoretical  physics!  You  seem  to  have  struck  a 
good line to start with.2 

On October 22nd of that same year, Fermi discovered that, interposing some paraffin 

between  the  source  of  the  neutrons  and  the  sample,  induced  radioactivity  increases 

The  Indian  astrophysicist  Subrahmanyan  Chandrasekhar  reports 

that,  at 

the 

beginning  of  the  Fifties,  Fermi  himself  described  to  him  the  circumstances  of  his  own 

sensibly.

1  This  paper  derives  from  a  study  of  the  Proceedings  of  the  seventh  Solvay  Conference, 
which  I  carried  out  while  writing  my  thesis  for  the  degree  in  Physics  about  (cid:147)Fermi  and  the 
birth  of  theoretical  physics  of  elementary  particles:  the  β-decay  theory(cid:148).  The  thesis  was 
supervised by professor Nicola Cabibbo and professor Fabio Sebastiani, and was discussed at 
the University (cid:147)La Sapienza(cid:148) of Rome on December 15th 2000.

I  described  to  Fermi  Hadamard(cid:146)s  thesis  regarding  the  psychology  of  invention  in 

mathematics,  namely,  how  one  must  distinguish  four  different  stages:  a  period  of 

conscious effort, a period of (cid:147)incubation(cid:148) when various combinations are made in the 

subconscious  mind,  the  moment  of  (cid:147)revelation(cid:148)  when  the  (cid:147)right  combination(cid:148)  (made 

in  the  subconscious)  emerges  into  the  conscious,  and  finally  the  stage  of  further 

conscious  effort.  I  then  asked  Fermi  if  the  process  of  discovery  in  physics  had  any 

similarity.  Fermi  volunteered  and  said  (his  account  made  so  great  an  impression  on 

me  that  though  this  is  written  from  memory,  I  believe  that  it  is  very  nearly  a  truly 

verbatim account):  

(cid:147)I  will  tell  you  how  I  came  to  make  the  discovery  which  I  suppose  is  the  most 

important  one  I  have  made(cid:148).  And  he  continued:  (cid:147)We  were  working  very  hard  on  the 

neutron  induced  radioactivity  and  the  results  we  were  obtaining  made  no  sense.  One 

day,  as  I  came  to  the  laboratory,  it  occurred  to  me  that  I  should  examine  the  effect  of 

placing a piece of lead before the incident neutrons. And instead of my usual custom, I 

took  great  pains  to  have  the  piece  of  lead  precisely  machined.  I  was  clearly 

dissatisfied  with  something:  I  tried  every  (cid:148)excuse(cid:148)  to  postpone  putting  the  piece  of 

lead in its place. When finally, with some reluctance, I was going to put it in its place, 

I  said  to  myself:  (cid:145)No!  I  do  not  want  this  piece  of  lead  here;  what  I  want  is  a  piece  of 

paraffin(cid:146).  It  was  just  like  that:  with  no  advanced  warning,  no  conscious,  prior, 

reasoning. I immediately took some odd piece of paraffin I could put my hands on and 
placed it where the piece of lead was to have been.(cid:148)3 

Referring  to  the  discovery  that  represents  the  first  step  towards  the  exploitation  of 
the energy contained in the nucleus, Gerald Holton defines it a (cid:147)mythological event(cid:148)4, 

all  the  more  so  because  (cid:147)everyone  seems  to  have  thought  that  the  more  energetic  the 
neutrons, the greater would be their efectiveness(cid:148).5

In  the  light  of  what  has  just  been  reported,  the  sudden  action  which  allowed  Fermi 
to discover the (cid:147)miraculous effects of the filtration by paraffin(cid:148),6 as Emilio SegrŁ calls 

them, seems to be devoid of any rational and methodological justification and appears, 

instead,  regulated  by  chance.  In  this  paper  I  will  try  to  reconstruct  what  (cid:150)  before 
October  22nd  1934  (cid:150)  was  already  known  about  the  slowing  down  of  neutrons  by 

paraffin  and  about  the  dependence  of  their  cross  section  on  velocity,  and  how  that 

knowledge could have an influence upon Fermi(cid:146)s discovery. 

§  1  (cid:150)  THE  DISCOVERY  OF  THE  EFFECTS  OF  HYDROGENATED 

SUBSTANCES ON THE RADIOACTIVITY INDUCED BY NEUTRONS 

 
In  April  1932,  just  two  months  after  the  observation  of  the  neutron  by  Chadwick,7 
John  Douglas  Cockroft  and  Ernest  Thomas  Sinton  Walton8  were  the  first  who  saw  the 

disintegrations provoked  in  atoms of  light elements  by artificially accelerated  charged 

particles. The following month, the Proceedings  of  the Royal Society received a paper 

by  Norman  Feather, 
disintegrate also if they are irradiated with neutrons.9

the  English  physicist  demonstrated

Edoardo  Amaldi  recalls  that  in  January  1934  the  Joliots  announced  the  artificial

after  the  discovery  of  Joliot  and  Curie  it  was  natural  to  think  of  producing  new 

radioactive  nuclides  using  bombarding  particles  different  from  alpha  particles,  as  for 
example protons, deuterons and neutrons.11 

However  natural  thinking  of  neutrons  could  be,  available  intensities  (about  one 
hundred  thousand  times  weaker  than  those  of  α-particles)  made  still  doubtful  the 

efficacy  of  those  particles  in  inducing  radioactivity.  Neutrons,  nevertheless,  had 
manifest advantages over alphas, (cid:147)all due to the electric neutrality(cid:148)12 

As  early  as  1920  when,  in  the  Bakerian  Lecture,  Lord  Rutherford  claimed  the 

existence  of  the  neutron,  he  said  that  its  external  field  would  be  practically  zero, 

except  very  close  to  the  nucleus,  and  in  consequence  it  should  be  able  to  move  freely 
through matter.13 

Much thicker matter, therefore, can be activated by the neutrons than by the alphas; 
in  fact,  feeling  the  effects  of  the  nuclear  Coulomb  field,  α-particles  are  rapidly 

adsorbed  whereas,  for  neutrons,  the  true  experimental  limitation  is  due  to  the  number 
of  electrons,  emitted  in  β-decay,  able  to  come  out  of  the  irradiated  sample  and  reach 

the  detector.  If  to  all  that  we  add  the  aptitude  of  neutrons  to  approach  the  nuclei  and, 

consequently, interact with them,  we  can easily find out that the weak intensity of the 

sources is partly counterbalanced. 

Starting  from  March  1934,  researches  on  neutron-induced  radioactivity  were 

systematically  carried  out  by  Fermi  and  his  collaborators,  on  atoms  of  all  elements  of 

increasing  weights.  The  studies  made  by  the  Roman  physicists  are  described  in  detail 

by  Amaldi,  who  recalls  that  experiments  were  soon  turned  to  better  specify  the  vague 

results first obtained for neutron-induced radioactivity. Amaldi and Bruno Pontecorvo, 

however,  as  they  came  to  this  stage,  had  to  face  an  incomprehensible  variability  of 

experimental results: 

It  became  apparent  that  the  activation  depended  on  the  condition  of  irradiation.  In 

particular  [(cid:133)  ,]  there  were  certain  wooden  tables  [(cid:133)]  which  had  miraculous 

properties.  As  Pontecorvo  noticed  accidentally,  silver  irradiated  on  those  tables

gained  more  activity  than  when  it  was  irradiated  on  the  usual  marble  table.  [(cid:133)]  In 
order to clarify the situation, I started a systematic investigation.14 

It  was  then  planned,  in  order  to  analyse  the  effect  of  the  surroundings,  to  study  the 

shielding  of  lead  on  the  neutrons:  they  were  partly  deviated  from  their  straight  path 

from the source to the sample but partly, if emitted in different directions, turned again 

towards the sample.

The  two  configurations  represented  above  in  Amaldi(cid:146)s  drawing  were  to  clarify  in 

which way some more lead (on the right) could compensate for the negative effect of a 

smaller shield (on the left). 

Fermi hesitated for a long time in using some lead to filter the neutrons and, finally, 

he  preferred  to  use  paraffin,  (cid:147)with  no  conscious,  prior,  reasoning(cid:148).  In  this  way  he 

discovered that the radioactivity induced by neutrons in the silver sample increases, by 

the very use of paraffin. 

recalls that  

A  similar  account,  supported  by  those  by  Fermi(cid:146)s  collaborators,  induced  Holton  to 

speak of a (cid:147)mythological fact(cid:148) when referring to this discovery. Amaldi, concerning it, 

the increase of the reaction cross section by reducing the velocity of the neutrons was 
at that time still contrary to our expectation;15

while SegrŁ states that: 

We  thought  that  the  more  energetic  the  neutrons  the  greater  their  effectiveness  in 
producing reactions; how wrong we were we would discover only six month later.16 

That  was  a  diffused  prejudice,  according  again  to  Holton,17  before  the  properties  of 

slow  neutrons  were  discovered  in  Rome;  a  prejudice  perhaps  justified  by  the  actual 

weakening of the effects of charged particles when they slow down. 

Amaldi,  however,  does  not  agree  with  the  (cid:145)fatalist(cid:146)  version  of  discovery  and  states 
the  importance  of  how  systematically  the experiments  were  conducted,  up  to  that  22nd 

October. 

It  is  decidedly  right  to  acknowledge  the  Roman  physicists(cid:146)  commitment  and  effort, 

but Fermi(cid:146)s intuition did not in fact depend on them. 

The article that Fermi and collaborators wrote the day of the discovery thus starts: 

In  the  course  of  experiments  on  induced  radioactivity  in  silver  irradiated  with 

neutrons,  anomalies  in  the  intensity  of  activation  have  been  noticed;  a  piece  of 

paraffin  some  centimetres  thick,  interposed  between  the  source  and  silver,  makes  the 
activation increase instead of reducing it.18 

To  what  extent,  nevertheless,  can  we  really  consider  the  observed  result  as 

completely  unexpected?  Could  that  (cid:147)instead  of  reducing  it(cid:148)  be  referred  to  a 

comparison with lead? Better: what was already known - in 1934 - about the effects of 

paraffin  on  neutrons  and  about  the  cross  section  of  the  latter,  and  what  did  Fermi 

already  know  about  all  that,  before  discovering  the  radioactivity  induced  by  slow 

neutrons?

§  2  (cid:150)  THE  RESEARCHES  ABOUT  NEUTRONS  IN  FRANCE  AND  IN  THE 

REMAINDER OF EUROPE 

The  experiments,  by  which  the  penetrating  radiation  emitted  by  beryllium  was 

established  to  be  composed  of  neutrons,  consisted  in  analysing  the  kinematics  of  the 

observed processes. 

As  the  Joliots  first  recognised,  that  radiation  is  able  to  expel  high  energy  protons 

from hydrogenous substances. In addition: 

Nous  avons  ØtudiØ  ces  rayonnements  par  l(cid:146)ionisation  qu(cid:146)ils  produisent  dans  une 

chambre montØe sur un ŁlectromŁtre Hoffmann. [(cid:133)] Le courant augmente notablement 

quand  on  interpose  des  Øcrans  de  substances  contenant  de  l(cid:146)hydrogŁne  comme  la 
paraffine, l(cid:146)eau, le cellophane. L(cid:146)effet le plus intense a ØtØ observØ avec la paraffine.19 

The  two  French  physicists  initially  identified  the  penetrating  radiation  from 

beryllium with photons: 

Ces  rayons  γ  de  grande  Ønergie  sont  capables  de  projeter  des  protons  de  grande 

vitesse  quand  ils  traversent  une  substance  hydrogØnØe.  [(cid:133)]  Cet  effet  s(cid:146)accompagne 
d(cid:146)une absorption considØrable du rayonnement par les noyaux d(cid:146)hydrogØne.20 

It  was  not  possible,  nevertheless,  to  refer  to  photons  without  self-contradictions. 

Chadwick carefully examined the kinematics of collisions in different elements and, in 

particular,  the  decrease  of  the  energy  transferred  by  the  penetrating  radiation  of 

beryllium  to  atoms,  as  the  mass  of  the  latter  increases;  he  established  in  this  way  that 

this radiation is made of neutral particles having about the same mass as protons. 

Once  it  was  understood  that  neutrons  expel  high  energy  protons  from  hydrogenous 

substances,  this  very  property  was  used  to  recognise  the  presence  of  neutrons:  (cid:147)La

les rayonnements de neutrons(cid:148).21 

Maurice  de  Broglie  and  Louis  Leprince-Ringuet  studied  the  effects  of  screens, 

placed laterally with respect to the neutrons trajectory: 

Au  cours  des  expØriences  on  enregistre  le  nombre  de  passages  de  noyaux  atomiques 

fortement ionisants, soit en mettant,  soit  en supprimant des Øcrans latØraux  de plomb, 

paraffine, KCl. [(cid:133)] L(cid:146)effet dß (cid:224) la dispersion des neutrons par les Øcrans latØraux est 
considØrable.22 

The  effect  of  the  lateral  screens  of  lead  is  of  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  (for 

example)  the  walls  of  the  laboratory  but,  (cid:147)avec  des  Øcrans  latØraux  de  KCl  et  de 

paraffine, il y a [(cid:133)] une forte augmentation du nombre des rayons observØe(cid:148): the two 

physicists,  in  fact,  explain  that  the  neutrons  can  expel  atoms  from  the  light  elements 

composing the screens. 

All  these  experiments  can  help  us  to  understand  the  type  of  equipment  used  by 
Amaldi in Rome, named (cid:147)castelletto(cid:148)[little castle]:23 it consisted of four little bricks of 

lead  placed  at  the  sides  of  a  square,  inside  which  the  Italian  physicist  put  a  source  of 

neutrons and a sample of silver to study the dependence of the activation on the mutual 

distance (this was the experiment which was carried out immediately before the idea of 

using the lead shields represented in figure 1); that activation changed only slightly, in 

contrast with what happened if the sample was outside the (cid:147)castelletto(cid:148).

With  regard  to  the  properties  of  the  neutrons,  not  only  was  their  capability  of 

expelling high energy protons known, but also that they are scarcely screened by lead.

In the session of the AcadØmie des Science of May 9th 1932, for example, Jean Thibaud 

and F. DuprØ la Tour reported that (cid:147)au del(cid:224) d(cid:146)un Øcran de 30 cm de plomb, il subsiste 
encore plus du dixiŁme de la radiation incidente(cid:148).24 

The  two  physicists  analyzed  the  absorption  of  neutrons  considering,  in  particular, 

the collisions against nuclei: 

Les  choc  nuclØaires  [(cid:133)]  sont  [(cid:133)]  capables,  s(cid:146)ils  ont  lieu  de  plein  fouet,  d(cid:146)absorber 

d(cid:146)un  coup  la  totalitØ  de  l(cid:146)Ønergie  du  neutron  (projection  atomique)  ou,  au  moins,  de 

diffuser  les  neutrons  et  de  les  renvoyer  vers  l(cid:146)arriŁre.  Remarquons  que  le  neutron, 

dØpourvu  de  charge,  peut,  (cid:224)  la  diffØrence  des  corpuscules  chargØs,  s(cid:146)approcher  trŁs 
prŁs de la surface nuclØaire.25 

Thibaud  and  DuprØ  la  Tour  justified  the  high  penetrating  power  of  neutrons,  due  to 

their  capability 

to  approach  practically  undisturbed 

to 

the  nuclei:  (cid:147)Pour  un 

rayonnement  prØalablement  fortement  fitrØ,  il  n(cid:146)y  aurait  absorption  du  neutron  que 
dans les chocs extrŒmement intimes avec les noyaux(cid:148).26 

The  interest  of  the  two  physicists(cid:146)  report  lies  also  in  the  mention  of  a  different 

behaviour of slow neutrons with respect to fast neutrons, even though they explain this 

phenomenon in terms of a wider angular dispersion of slow neutrons: 

L(cid:146)absorption comparativement plus intense qui a lieu dans les premiers centimŁtres de 

matiŁre  serait  due  (cid:224)  la  filtration  d(cid:146)une  partie  beaucoup  plus  absorbable  du 

rayonnement  hØtØrogŁne  (neutrons  lents).  On  peut  concevoir,  par  exemple,  que  ces 

neutrons  lents  subissent  une  diffusion  latØrale,  sur  les  premiŁres  couches  de  matiŁre, 
beaucoup plus intense que les corpuscules rapides.27 

The  two  French  physicists  confirmed  the  importance  of  the  velocity  of  neutrons  in 

one of their articles, the following October: (cid:147)Nous pensons que les neutrons les moins 
pØnØtrants sont les plus fortement diffusØs(cid:148).28

In  the  meanwhile,  Feather  obtained  the  disintegration  of  light  elements  resorting  to 

neutrons.  In  spite  of  the  weak  intensity  of  incident  radiation,  the  English  physicist, 

using  a  cloud  chamber,  noticed  a 

remarkable  effectiveness 

in  producing 

disintegrations: 

About  130  cases  of  interaction  between  a  neutron  and  a  nitrogen  nucleus  have  been 

observed;  of  these  about  30  resulted  in  disintegration,  more  than  half  of  the  latter 

without  capture  of  the  neutron.  This  is  very  different  from  the  results  obtained  under 
α-particles  bombardment,  where  elastic  collisions 

[(cid:133)]  outnumber 

inelastic 

(disintegrations)  collisions  by  a  factor  of  1000:1.  [(cid:133)]  The  former  of  these  points  of 

difference is certainly to be ascribed to the different extent of the external fields of the 
two particles.29 

The great efficacy of neutrons in inducing nuclear disintegrations was demonstrated 

by Feather in this way and, as we will soon see, would afterwards be also discussed by 

the  Joliots.  In  his  1938  Nobel  Lecture,  while  reconstructing  the  circumstances  in 

which neutron induced radioactivity was discovered, Fermi himself would specify that 

(cid:147)As  a  matter  of  fact,  neutrons  were  already  known  to  be  an  efficient  agent  for 
producing some nuclear disintegration(cid:148).30 

In  July  1932,  M.  de  Broglie  and  Leprince-Ringuet,  in  referring  to  the  scarce 
absorption  of  neutrons  by  heavy  elements,  spoke  of  (cid:147)trasparence  du  plomb(cid:148),31  which 

was  then  useful  to  filter  neutrons  and  (cid:147)diminuer  les  effets  des  rayons  gamma  de 

l(cid:146)emanation(cid:148).  It  was  not  lead,  therefore,  the  most  suitable  element  to  shield  the 

neutrons. 

The  Joliots  dealt  with  important  studies  about  neutrons.  It  is  impossible  to 

equivocate  what  is  reported  on  page  23  of  their  paper  Preuves  sperimentales  de 
l(cid:146)existence du neutron:32  

L(cid:146)Øtude  de  l(cid:146)absorption  du  rayonnement  Po  +  Be  dans  divers  ØlØments  montra  une

Neither can be misunderstood what follows shortly after: 

La  radiation  de  Po  +  Li  est  considØrablement  plus  absorbØe,  (cid:224)  masse  superficielle 

Øgale, par la paraffine par exemple, que par le plomb, contrairement (cid:224) ce qui se passe 
pour les rayons γ du polonium;33 

precisely  because  of  these  foundations  (cid:147)il  y  a  lieu  de  conclure  (cid:224)  l(cid:146)existence  d(cid:146)un 

rayonnement nouveau, probablement le neutron(cid:148). 

They soon turn to the absorption of neutrons in what follows: 

L(cid:146)absorption  d(cid:146)un  faisceau  de  neutrons  se  compose  de  deux  termes.  Un  terme 

d(cid:146)absorption  vraie,  correspondant  (cid:224)  la  perte  d(cid:146)Ønergie  par  choc  sur  un  noyau 

(d(cid:146)autant  plus  ØlevØe  que  le  noyau  est  plus  lØger),  et  d(cid:146)un  terme  d(cid:146)absorption  par 

diffusion.  [(cid:133)]  Ce  dernier  terme  est  prØpondØrant  pour  les  noyaux  lourds.  [(cid:133)]  On 

observe globalement que les ØlØments lØgers produisent une absorption  massique bien 

plus forte que les ØlØments lourds, caractŁre qui distingue le rayonnement de neutrons 

des autres radiations pØnØtrantes. 

As  regards  disintegrations  by  neutrons,  the  Joliots  finally  confirm  what  Feather 

stated in May: 

La probabilitØ de ce phØnomŁne est grande relativement (cid:224) celle des transmutations par 
les particules α. Ce fait tient (cid:224) ce que le neutron peut facilement traverser la barriŁre 
de potentiel des noyaux.34 

This  property  partly  counterbalances  the  weak  intensity  of  neutrons  flows,  so  much 

that  we  read  in  a  note  at  the  end  of  Joliots(cid:146)  paper:  (cid:147)D(cid:146)aprŁs  des  expØriences

On  voit  donc  que  l(cid:146)Øtude  du  phØnomŁne  d(cid:146)Ømission  des  neutrons  et  celle  des  effets 

qu(cid:146)ils  produisent  dans  la  matiŁre  peut  Œtre  dØj(cid:224)  considØrØe  comme  un  des  plus 
puissants moyens d(cid:146)exploration des noyaux atomiques.36 

Another  paper  by  the  two  French  physicists  can  confirm  the  awareness  of  the 

efficacy that hydrogenous substances have in absorbing neutrons: 

On  Øtudie  le  rayonnement  nuclØaire  pØnØtrant  excitØ  par  les  rayons  α  du  polonium 

dans  les  ØlØments  lØgers  en  employant  une  chambre  d(cid:146)ionisation  remplie  de  mØthane 

ou  de  butane  pour  augmenter  l(cid:146)effet  des  neutrons;  le  rayonnement  est  extrŒmement 

pØnØtrant  et 
l(cid:146)absorption dans un bloc de 6,5 cm d(cid:146)Øpaisseur de paraffine est notable.37

When irradiating metallic sodium, (cid:147)le rayonnement Ømis traverse 3 cm de plomb. Il 
est  beaucoup  plus  absorbØ  dans  3  gr/cm2  de  paraffine  que  dans  3  gr/cm2  de  plomb, 
caractŁre qui indique la prØsence de neutrons(cid:148).38 

It is interesting, finally, if one recalls that Franco Rasetti was in Rome, what is then 

written: 

La  courbe  relative  (cid:224)  l(cid:146)excitation  des  neutrons  du  glucinium  est  en  trŁs  bon  accord 

avec  celle  de  Rasetti  qui  a  dØcelØ  les  neutrons  au  moyen  d(cid:146)un  compteur  contenant  de 
la paraffine.39 

There is no doubt, therefore, that in 1933 it was already known that light substances 

(like  paraffin)  slow  down  and  absorb  neutrons  much  more  efficiently  than  heavy  ones 

(like lead) do. 

It  was  already  known,  moreover,  that  neutrons  are  a  good  means  to  induce  nuclear 

disintegrations,  due  to  their  electrical  neutrality,  and  that,  as  they  assume  different 

velocity, they show different behaviours.  

The properties of the neutrons interacting with matter were studied more accurately 

-  among  others  -  by  Chadwick  and  important  conclusions  about  their  scattering  cross 

section were reached.

SECTION 

§  3  (cid:150)  THE  STUDIES  ABOUT  THE  NEUTRONS  SCATTERING  CROSS 

 
On  May  22nd  1933,  more  than  one  year  before  Fermi(cid:146)s  experiments  on  slow 
neutrons,  Chadwick  gave  the  Bakerian  Lecture  entitled  The  neutron.40  He  discussed 

there some important characteristics of the particle he himself had discovered. 

The most obvious properties of the neutron are its ability to set in motion the atoms of 
matter through which it passes and its great penetrating power.41 

Chadwick,  in  addition,  analyses  (cid:147)the  dependence  of  the  neutron  emission  on  the 
velocity  of  the  bombarding  α-particles(cid:148).42  The  neutrons  are  indirectly  observed 

resorting  to  a  ionisation  chamber,  with  some  paraffin  at  the  entrance  (cid:147)to  increase  the 
effect(cid:148).43 

Chadwick thus concludes in reporting his results: 

The  probability  of  a  collision  between  a  neutron  and  a  nitrogen  atom  in  the  chamber 
or a proton in the paraffin wax depends on the velocity of the neutron.44 

The  fifth  paragraph  closely  examines  the  theory  of  Collisions  of  neutrons  with 
atomic  nuclei.45  Chadwick  specifies  that  the  most  interesting  collisions  are  those 

between  neutrons  and  protons  and  that,  for  these  ones,  experiments  pointed  out  that 
(cid:147)most of the collisions were due to slow neutrons(cid:148).46 

It  is  worth  quoting  the  experiment  to  determine  the  (cid:147)collision  radius(cid:148),  that 

Chadwick  now  describes.  The  English  physicist  used  a  ionisation  chamber  filled  with 

various gases (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen or argon) and he observed, in each case, the 

ionisation obtained by irradiating the gas with neutrons.

The experiment is carried out with neutrons both from beryllium and from boron. In 

the  first  case,  the  number  of  collisions  in  hydrogen  is  only  a  little  lower  than  that  in 

nitrogen and in oxygen; in the case of neutrons from boron (a bit slower), 

the number of deflexions in hydrogen was now about twice the number of deflexions in 

nitrogen,  suggesting  that  the  collision  radius  either  of  hydrogen  or  nitrogen  varies 

rapidly  with  the  velocity  of  the  neutron.  [(cid:133)]  Some  experiments  with  slower  neutrons 

suggest  that  the  radius  for  the  proton  collisions  continues  to  increase  as  the  velocity 
of the neutron decreases.47 

Chadwick  provides  a  theoretical  explanation  of  the  phenomenon,  too:  (cid:147)In  the 

consideration  of  the  neutron-proton  collision  we  thus  have  to  explain  [(cid:133)]  that  the 
collision  radius  decreases(cid:148).48  The  English  physicist,  to  this  end,  quotes  the  expression 

of the cross section for two independent particles: 

Q =

h2
πM2v2

 

(
2n + 1

)⋅ sin2δ

. 

n

n

The  zero  order  term  is  the  only  important  one,  which  means  that  the  range  of  the 

neutron-proton interaction is small compared with 

. As a consequence: 

h
2πMv

The  potential  field  of  a  proton  and  a  neutron  may  be  roughly  likened  to  a  very  deep 

hole of small radius. [(cid:133)] Thus  δ

π  approximately and  Q ≈

= 1
2

0

h

πM 2v2 . 49 

Chadwick thus obtains that the scattering cross section for neutron-proton collisions 

increases as the relative velocity  v  of the two particles decreases.  

§ 4 (cid:150) THE 1933 SOLVAY CONFERENCE 

In  contrast  to  the  conventional  meetings  in  which  reports  are  given  on  the  successful 

solution of scientific problems, the Solvay Conferences were conceived to help directly 
in solving specific problems of unusual difficulty.50

In  Werner  Heisenberg(cid:146)s  synthetic  report,  that  is  the  style  characterising  the 

conferences promoted for the first time by the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay. The 

German  physicist  also  adds  that  (cid:147)there  can  be  no  doubt  that  [(cid:133)]  the  Solvay 
Conferences  played  an  essential  role  in  the  history  of  physics(cid:148),51  while  referring 

particularly  to  the  conferences  before  the  war  and,  in  a  more  specific  way,  to  the  one 

organised  in  1933,  which  perhaps  represented  the  last  great  opportunity  for  an 

international scientific debate before the war events. 

§ 4.1 (cid:150) THE POINT OF THE SITUATION 

In  the  previous  paragraphs  we  ascertained  that,  in  1933,  hydrogenous  substances 

were already known to better slow down the neutrons than lead does; in the same way 

as  neutron-proton  scattering  cross  section  was  acknowledged,  both  from  experiments 

and from theory, as a decreasing function of the velocity of neutrons themselves. 

It  must  be  still  clarified,  however,  what  Fermi  did  know  about  the  properties  of 

paraffin and of slow neutrons. 

The papers up to now quoted had all been published in prestigious reviews: Journal 

de  Physique,  Proceedings  of  the  Royal  Society,  Comptes  Rendus  de  l(cid:146)AcadØmie  des 

Sciences,  all  having  been  signed  by  the  most  important  nuclear  physicists  of  the  time. 

There  is  no  reason  to  suspect  that  Fermi,  leader  of  a  group  that  had,  for  a  long  time, 

turned  his  own  interest  towards  the  atomic  nucleus,  was  not  up  to  date  about  those 

published results. Even if we admitted such a little reasonable possibility, more cogent 

arguments do exist, not only founded on good sense, that we can exactly connect with 

the  Italian  physicist(cid:146)s  participation  in  the  seventh  Solvay  Conference  on  Structure  et 
propriØtØs  des  noyaux  atomiques52  which  took  place  in  Bruxelles  from  22nd  and  29th 

October 1934.

The  lectures  where  rich  in  new  and  stimulating  contents;  the  Conference  closely 

followed,  in  fact,  some  important  experimental  and  theoretical  achievements  which 

provided  plenty  of  topics  for  the  physicists  engaged  in  the  study  of  nuclei  and 

particles:  the  neutron,  the  positron  and  the  deuteron  joined  to  corpuscles  already 

known,  the  existence  of  the  neutrino  was  seriously  considered  and  the  nuclear  forces 

represented an important way of description. 

We  are  only  going  to  analyse,  among  the  remarkable  amount  of  documents 

contained  in  the  Proceedings  of  the  Conference,  the  contributions  of  Chadwick  and  of 

the  Joliots  and  the  subsequent  discussions:  they  witness  the  attention  of  the  scientific 

community, and of Fermi himself, to what concerned neutrons. 

§ 4.2 (cid:150) CHADWICK(cid:146)S CONTRIBUTION 

 
In his speech, not only did Chadwick deal with Diffusion anomale des particules α. 

Trasmutation  des  ØlØments  par  des  particules  α,  but  he  also  treated  of  Le  neutron,53 

devoting  to  that  subject  about  one  half  of  his  talk.  The  English  physicist  largely 

reproposed what he had already presented in his Bakerian Lecture. 

Chadwick  first  recalled  that  nuclear  reactions  take  place  only  at  distances 

comparable with nuclear dimensions, and then described the methods to determine the 

neutron  mass,  based  on  the  knowledge  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  neutron  itself;  the 

latter  (cid:147)peut  Œtre  dØterminØe  en  misurant  le  parcours  maximum  des  protons  extraits  de 
la paraffine(cid:148).54 

A long paragraph follows, in which Collisions entre neutrons et noyaux atomiques55 

are treated. Here are some passages: 

Le  neutron  ne  sera  dØviØ  qu(cid:146)en  cas  de  chocs  trØs  directs.  [(cid:133)]  La  distribution  des 

neutrons  diffusØs  ne  sera  pas  apprØciablement  dissymetrique.  [(cid:133)]  Il  semble  cepedant

Chadwick  quotes  the  theoretical  studies  carried  out  by  Harrie  Massey  about 

collisions by neutrons and states that (cid:147)les collisions entre neutron et proton prØsentent 
un  intØrŒt  tout  particulier(cid:148).57  He  also  describes  the  results  of  experiments  concerning 

neutron-proton scattering, specifying: 

La  distribution  angulaire  des  protons  frappØs  par  des  neutrons  a  ØtØ  observØe  par 

Auger  et  Monod-Herzen  et  aussi  par  Kurie.  [(cid:133)]  Les  deux  sØries  d(cid:146)observations 

conduisent  au  mŒme  rØsultat:  la  distribution  angulaire  des  protons  par  rapport  au 

centre  de  masse  du  systŁme  en  collision  est  (cid:224)  peu  prŁs  uniforme.  Le  rayon  de  choc  a 

ØtØ  ØvaluØ  par  Meitner  et  Philipp.  [(cid:133)]  et  il  semble  rØsulter  de  leurs  donnØes  que  la 
plupart des collisions Øtaient dues (cid:224) des neutrons lents.58 

Then, Chadwick explains his own results: 

J(cid:146)ai  constatØ  que  le  rayon  de  choc  de  l(cid:146)hydrogŁne  varie  avec  la  vitesse  des  neutrons. 

[(cid:133)]  Quelques  expØriences  avec  des  neutrons  lents  semblent  indiquer  que  le  rayon  de 
choc continue d(cid:146)augmenter quand la vitesse des neutrons diminue.59 

Chadwick,  hence,  clearly  states  that  slow  neutrons  seem  to  have  more  chance  to  be 

scattered than fast ones. This is a statement stronger than that by Thibaud and DuprØ la 

Tour, who only thought of a wider angular dispersion. 

Chadwick  now  reports  the  formula  for  the  scattering  cross  section,  as  obtained  by 

the two independent particles collision theory of wave-mechanics: 

Q ≈

h 2
πM 2v2 . 

La  section  de  choc,  pour  une  rencontre  avec  un  proton,  est  grande  et  varie  dans  le 
sens voulu avec la vitesse du neutron.60 

§ 4.3 (cid:150) THE JOLIOTS(cid:146) CONTRIBUTION AND THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION 

The Joliots tackled the Rayonnement pØnØtrant des atomes sous l(cid:146)action des rayons 
α.61  Their  talk  mostly  concerns  the  physics  of  the  neutron,  starting  with  the 

reconstruction  of  the  discovery  of  that  particle  and  going  on  with  the  study  of  its

properties (among the others its absorption by matter) and of the characteristics of the 
γ-rays  emitted,  by  some  elements,  together  with  neutrons.  The  second  part  is  instead 
devoted to the study of (cid:201)lectrons de matØrialisation et de transmutation.62 

The  debate  following  the  Joliots(cid:146)  talk  was  very  enlightening  due  to  the  quality  and 

the  number  of  those  who  partecipated  in  the  discussion:  Lise  Meitner,  Chadwick, 

Francis  Perrin,  Werner  Heisenberg,  Fermi,  Maurice  de  Broglie,  Walther  Bothe,  Ernest 

Lawrence, George Gamow, Rutherford, Rudolf Peierls, Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli(cid:133)  

When  Heisenberg  takes  the  floor,  he  expresses  doubts  about  the  dependence  of 

neutron-proton  scattering  cross  section  on  the  square  of  the  de  Broglie  wavelength  of 

neutrons,  

c(cid:146)est-(cid:224)-dire une aire qui surpasse la section du noyau; elle la surpasse de plus en plus 

(cid:224) mesure que la vitesse des neutrons diminue. [(cid:133)] Il me semble que pour r0 (rayon de 
la sphŁre d(cid:146)action des noyaux) << λ, la phase δ0 doit toujours Œtre trŁs petite.63 

Heisenberg  will  again  tackle  this  argument  but,  before  doing  that,  Fermi  does  talk 

about  the  cross  section:  he  first  (cid:147)rappelle  les  hypothŁses  sur  lesquelles  est  Øtablie  la

§ 5 (cid:150) CONCLUSIONS 

The  experiments  the  Joliots  carried  out  in  France  and  those  of  Chadwick  in 

Cambridge  show  the  knowledge  available,  at  the  end  of  1933,  on  the  properties  of 

neutrons  passing 

through  matter,  and 

the  Proceedings  of 

the  seventh  Solvay 

Conference  (which  took  place  in  October  of  that  same  year)  show  to  what  extent  the 

international  community  was  acquainted  with  those  results.  Fermi(cid:146)s  argumentation  in 

Bruxelles proves the interest of the Roman physicist for the behaviour of the neutrons. 

We  can  definitely  state  that,  already  at  the  end  of  1933,  he  was  aware  both  of  the 

increase  of  the  scattering  cross  section  when  the  energy  decreases  and  of  the  larger 

efficiency of paraffin with respect to lead in the slowing down and in the absorption of 

neutrons.  

It  is  not  difficult  to  suppose  that  in  Fermi(cid:146)s  subconscious  mind  some  unconscious 

reasoning  had  started  (since  the  time  of  his  participation  in  the  Solvay  Conference, 

which  began  exactly  one  year  before  the  experiments  on  slow  neutrons,  or  since  even 

previous  circumstances)  and  that  they  resulted,  after  a  (cid:147)period  of  incubation(cid:148)  in  the 

(cid:147)immediate(cid:148) decision he took in October 1934; that decision, in other words, would be 

the  result  of  a  subconscious  elaboration  of  what  was  already  known  to  the  Italian 

physicist.  Such  a  reconstruction  would,  among  other  things,  confirm  Hadamard(cid:146)s 

thesis  on  the  psychology  of  inventions  in  mathematics  and  could  be  supported  by  the 

very  fact  that  Fermi,  in  answering  Chandrasekhar,  thought  of  his  (cid:145)sudden(cid:146)  decision  to 

use  paraffin  as  an  example  that  could  confirm  the  hypothesis  of  the  great  French 

mathematician. 

In  the  light  of  what  has  here  been  exposed,  it  seems  natural,  if  the  lead  wedge  was 

used  with  the  aim  of  studying  the  shield-effect  on  neutrons,  that  Fermi  suddenly 

decided  to  substitute  it  with  some  piece  of  paraffin;  and,  in  the  same  fashion,  that  he 

soon  explained,  after  the  lunch-break,  the  observed  phenomenon  as  a  consequence  of 

the  increase  of  the  reaction  cross  section  as  the  neutrons  velocity  decreases  (even  if 

the  difference  must  be  pointed  out  between  the  reaction  cross  section  and  the 

scattering cross section). Far from unexpected becomes, furthermore, what he wrote in 

his  first  paper  together  with  the  other  Roman  physicists:  (cid:147)It  is  plausible  that  the 

19 

neutron-proton  cross  section  grows  up  as  the  energy  decreases(cid:148);67  while  the  sentence: 

(cid:147)a  piece  of  paraffin  some  centimetre  thick,  interposed  between  the  source  and  the 
silver,  makes  the  activation  increase  instead  of  reducing  it(cid:148)68  could  really  imply  a 

comparison with lead. 

Fermi  himself,  anyway,  while  commenting  with  his  collaborators  upon 

the 

experiments  which  revealed  the  efficiency  of  the  neutrons,  slowed  down  by  paraffin, 

in  inducing  radioactivity,  said:  (cid:147)What  a  stupid  thing  to  have  discovered  this 
phenomenon without having be able of foresee it(cid:148).69 

Giorgio  Dragoni  suggests,  in  an  essay  in  which  he  looks  for  the  warning  signs  of 

Fermi(cid:146)s  discovery,  that  the  reading  of  some  of  the  Joliots(cid:146)  paper  or,  perhaps,  the 

Italian  physicist(cid:146)s  participation  in  some  seminars  could  really  have  some  importance 

(but  Fermi  actually  took  part,  much  more  than  in  a  seminar,  in  the  1933  Solvay 

Conference). Dragoni himself specifies that 

putting  in  evidence  this  possibility  does  not  mean  to  belittle  the  work  of  Fermi,  of 

Amaldi  and  of  the  other  members  of  the  group  at  all.  On  the  contrary,  in  this  way  we 

want  to  contribute  to  clarify  and  put  in  the  right  light  what  too  often  is  labelled  as  a 
mere (cid:147)chance(cid:148) discovery.70

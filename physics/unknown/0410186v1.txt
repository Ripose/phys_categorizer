Abstract 
A new method to obtain the radial profile of the magnetic perturbation in a toroidal force-free plasma having 
circular  cross  section  is  developed.  The  method  is  quite  general  and  can  be  applied  to  any  circular  low-beta 
plasma once suitable boundary conditions are imposed. In particular, due to its characteristics, it is appropriate 
for describing the Reversed Field Pinch (RFP) configuration. 

The curvilinear metric of the toroidal geometry is described by adopting flux co-ordinates, and the magnetic 
field  is  expressed  by  the  contravariant  representation  with  two  independent  potentials.  The  method  leads  to  a 
system of Newcomb-like equations in the two independent potentials for modes with the same toroidal n-number 
and poloidal mode number m coupled by toroidicity.  

The advantage of this description is that the potentials together with the metric coefficients can be related in 
a straightforward manner to the magnetic field. Moreover it is formally simple and maintains a similarity with 
the cylindrical treatment. Indeed it is customary in RFPs to approach the analysis of MHD instabilities by using 
cylindrical geometry. Nonetheless the effect of a more realistic toroidal geometry can play an important role, and 
indeed  by  applying  the  method  to  the  Reversed  Field  eXperiment  (RFX)  plasma  we  found  that  the  toroidal 
effects on the magnetic perturbations are not negligible. 

 
Introduction and model description 
In  a  reversed  field  pinch  (RFP)  plasma  the  equilibrium  configuration  is  sustained  by 
means  of  the  dynamo  mechanism  provided  mainly  by  tearing  modes  [1,2].  Typically  these 
harmonics are present with a broad toroidal n-number spectrum with poloidal mode numbers 
mostly  m=1,  m=0.  In  RFP  plasmas  it  is  customary  to  study  tearing  modes  assuming 
cylindrical geometry, nonetheless in the actual experiments the aspect ratio is not so large as 
to  make  the  toroidal  effects  negligible.  The  toroidicity  produces  poloidal  harmonics  in  the 
equilibrium  quantities  (at  the  leading  order  m=±1,  n=0),  which  act  as  mediators  between 
modes with the same toroidal number and different poloidal numbers. This kind of interaction 
is called toroidal coupling and plays an important role in tokamak configuration [3,4]. 

In [5] we presented a new method for mode analysis in a realistic toroidal geometry for a 
force-free plasma with circular cross section. The interested reader can refer to that work for 
details. The starting point is the contravariant representation of the magnetic field:

Here flux co-ordinates referred to non-concentric unperturbed circular magnetic surfaces 
(r:  magnetic  surface  radius;  J :  poloidal-like  angle;  f :  toroidal  angle)  are  adopted.  The 
quantities F0 and Y
0 can be identified respectively with the toroidal and poloidal flux of the 
. The complex harmonics f m,n, y  m,n represent the 
unperturbed magnetic surfaces divided by 2p
perturbations. Through the linearized ideal force balance equation the model leads to a system 
of Newcomb-like equations in the two independent potentials for the modes with the same n-
number and m-number coupled by toroidicity:

By  using  this  reconstruction  it  is  possible  to  discriminate  between  different  poloidal 
harmonics using external magnetic fluctuations measurements. The method is applied to the 
RFX  experiment  [6]  and  considering  the  specific  probes  layout  (two  toroidal  arrays  of  72 
pick-up  coils  for  the  toroidal  field  measurement  on  the  inner  surface  of  the  ideal  shell  at 
opposite  poloidal  angles  q m,  q m+p  )  one  has  the  following  limitations  on  the  reconstructed 
harmonics: m=-1,0,1,2 and n£ 13. In this interval, for the typical RFX equilibrium, the m=2, 
m=-1  modes  are  toroidally  generated  non-resonant  sideband  of  the  m=1,  m=0  respectively. 
The m=0 are resonant at the reversal surface and the m=1 are resonant for n‡ 7. The latter are 
the dominant dynamo modes of RFX.  

For n>14 the m=2 harmonics become resonant and further measurements, not available at 
the  time  of  the  last  experimental  campaign  of  RFX,  would  be  necessary  to  get  the  mode 
reconstruction. 

 
Application to experimental data 
In RFX the analysis of magnetic fluctuations has been done so far with the assumption of 
cylindrical geometry [7]. In this context the half-sum and half-difference of the signals from 
the  two  arrays  were  related  respectively  to  the  even-m  and  odd-m  components  of  the 
fluctuation  respectively.  These  two  branches  were  then  identified  with  the  m=0  harmonics 
(the  even-m)  and  m=1  harmonics  (the  odd-m).  The  new  toroidal  analysis  highlights  that, 
though this identification is fairly adequate for m=1 harmonics, it is generally misleading for 
m=0. Indeed the expression of the nth toroidal component of the half-sum Sn, emerging from 
the  toroidal  reconstruction,  is  a  mixture  of  various  contributions,  which  can  have  similar 
amplitude, not directly distinguishable in the cylindrical analysis[5]:

Here l 1=o(e), l 2=o(e 2) are quantities related to the toroidal geometry. As can be seen Sn 
gets contributions from all m=-1,0,1,2 with different weights. When n£ 6 Sn is related without 
ambiguity to the m=0 poloidal harmonic, because only this mode is resonant while the other 
harmonics  are  toroidally  induced  sideband  with  negligible  contributions  in  (6).  But  in 
correspondence of the dominant (n‡ 7) m=1 modes, the last three terms related to the m=0,1,2 
harmonics have comparable amplitude (the m=-1 term is always very small). In this case one 
cannot identify Sn with any particular (m,n) harmonic. 

In  figure  (1)  we  show  a  comparison  between  the  spectra  obtained  with  the  standard 
cylindrical analysis of the edge data (left), and with the toroidal reconstruction model (right). 
The  harmonics  refer  to  the  edge  toroidal  magnetic  field.  The  reconstructed  m=1  modes  are 
almost  identical  to  the  “cylindrical”  m-odd  for  all  toroidal  numbers.  Differently  for  the  m-
even, since we have shown they are a mixture of the m=0,1,2 harmonics. Notice that, while 
the  (0,  n£ 6)  modes  are  almost  identical  to  the  (m-even,  n£ 6),  the  trend  of  the  (0,  n‡ 7) 
harmonics  departs  from  the  (m-even,  n‡ 7)  spectrum,  indeed  showing  a  clear  contribution 
from the dominant (1,n‡ 7) modes. The same is seen for the (2, n‡ 7) modes, because they are 
totally generated as sidebands of the corresponding m=1 modes. Differently from the m=2, the 
shape  of  the  (0,  n‡ 7)  spectrum  cannot  be  explained  only  in  terms  of  the  geometrical  m=0 
sideband  from  the  m=1,  since  we  have  found  that  the  contribution  of  this  sideband  is  not 
significant  at  the  reversal  surface.  Therefore  we  can  conclude  the  system  is  undergoing  a 
dynamical  process:  the  already  unstable  m=0,  n‡ 7  modes  are  further  destabilised  by  the 
toroidal coupling with the corresponding m=1. 

An  indication  of  the  reliability  of  our  analysis  is  also  obtained  when  looking  at 
spontaneous mode rotations (figure 2). A spontaneous rotation of an (m-odd, n) mode seen in 
the measured data is recovered in the reconstructed (m=1, n) harmonic and is absent from the 
(m=0, n) one. At the same time one can clearly see the toroidal generation of m=2 mode that 
follows  the  rotation  of  the  m=1  mode,  and  is  independent  from  the  m=0  harmonic.  This 
proves that the various harmonic contributions are correctly identified. 

The solution of equations (4, 5) provides complete information on the radial field profile 
of  the  modes  showing  some  differences  with  respect  to  the  cylindrical  case.  In  figure  3  we 
compare  the  radial  field  profile  coming  from  our  toroidal  analysis  with  the  correspondent 
profile obtained by solving Newcomb’s equation in cylindrical geometry for the mode (0,8). 
The  two  functions  are  quite  different  especially  in  the  core,  where  the  coupling  with  the 
resonant mode (1,8) gives the largest contribution. 

The  knowledge  of  the  profiles  allows  in  particular  the  determination  of  the  radial  field 
amplitudes at the respective resonances of each mode. This “radial field spectrum” is useful 
when  comparing  magnetic  topology  and  tomographic  reconstructions.  In  RFX  we  have 
evidence of the presence of a well defined thermal structure in correspondence with particular 
regimes  where  a  dominant  (1,  n)  mode  is  present  in  the  magnetic  spectrum  [8].  This 
correspondence is clearer when considering, in place of the edge toroidal field spectrum, the 
radial field spectrum. As an example, in figure 4 we show the spectrum at the edge (left) for 
the toroidal field fluctuations, and that of the radial field at the resonances (right). The plot 
refers to a shot that has a thermal structure: the spectrum at the edge is unable to explain the 
tomographic result, but this can be clearly interpreted from the radial field spectrum.  

We have also verified that the shapes of the thermal structure and of the island associated 

to the dominant mode, as reconstructed by our method, are compatible (figure 5). 

 
Conclusions 
We  have  specialized  to  the  RFX  experiment  a  general  method  for  obtaining  the  radial 
profile  of  magnetic  field  fluctuations  in  toroidal  geometry.  Though  typically  RFP  machines 
are  well  described  in  cylindrical  geometry,  the  coupling  of  magnetic  fluctuations  due  to 

toroidal  geometry  cannot  be  totally  neglected.  In  particular  this  is  a  dynamical  mechanism 
that acts as a further destabilization source for the magnetic field perturbation. 

We  have  shown  that  the  interpretation  of  experimental  data  in  some  cases  can  be 
ambiguous  if  considered  in  cylindrical  geometry,  but  is  well  interpreted  when  taking  into 
account the more realistic configuration.

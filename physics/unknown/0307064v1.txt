Abstract 
 
 
Postulates which lead to Minkowski spacetime are amended in a subtle way, and used 
to  construct  a  consistent  flat  spacetime  geometry  with  intrinsic  quantum  character. 
Events  in  the  new  quantum  geometry  are  described  by  labels  of  the  form  (t,  x,  s) 
where t (time) and x (spatial extent) are familiar and s is a positive integer. Structure-
determining parameters for the novel spacetime are explored in some detail. Particular 
structure  parameters  can  be  shown  to  generate  equations  of  mainstream  quantum 
mechanics, and structure parameters can also be chosen which lead to the appearance 
of  quantum  particles  as  spatially  extended  moieties,  such  as  strings.  Further 
elaboration  is  required  before  the  new  spacetime  can  be  used  as  a  comprehensive 
basis  for  physical  theory,  however  even  at  the  unfinished  level  a  new  way  of 
accounting for rest mass emerges, and it is predicted that future experiments will fail 
to find Higgs particles. 
 
 
1) Introduction 
 
 
The concept that spacetime itself exhibits quantum character has been recently 
discussed in the following terms: Amelino-Camelia [1] has noted that spacetime 
quantisation is a possibility arising from the unification of general relativity and 
quantum theory. This could involve a discretisation of spacetime and/or an 
uncertainty principle that would forbid the accurate measurement of distance between  
spacetime points. Quantum fluctuations of distances could be observed in an 
interferometer as a source of noise [2]. In other work [3,4], Amelino-Camelia has 
proposed a spacetime characterised by observer-independent scales of velocity (c) and 
length (Planck length) in which a deformed Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction forbids 
any inertial observer from obtaining access to sub-Planckian lengths. This theory has 
come to be known as Double Special Relativity (DSR) theory, and the ideas have 
been significantly developed by Magueijo and Smolin [5]. Scenarios in DSR can be 
developed in which the speed of light is wavelength-dependent, the ultra high energy

cosmic ray anomaly is resolved and where there is a maximum momentum for an 
elementary particle.  
 
Ashtekar [6] has noted that a fundamental discreteness in a quantum theory of 
geometry appears in the construction of weave states. If one wants to recover a given 
classical geometry on large scales, polymer excitations cannot be packed arbitrarily 
close together.  Di Bartolo, Gambini and Pullin [7] provide a method to quantise 
systems formulated on discrete spacetimes. In this case the discreteness of spacetime 
is put in by hand. Gambini and Pullin [8] note that the discretisation of the Einstein 
equation can lead to an inconsistent discrete theory. By contrast Reisenberger and 
Rovelli [9] note that the discreteness in spin foam models of gravity arises in a less 
artificial way, and promises to remove the ultraviolet divergences found in 
perturbation theories of quantum gravity and matter fields.  
 
The starting point in this work is the contemplation of a nonstandard set of foundation 
postulates for a spacetime geometry. The generic methodology is therefore similar to 
that used by Amelino-Camelia to develop DSR. Five postulates will be used to 
develop a geometry with intrinsic quantum character, i.e. a geometry where: 
 

at least one event-labeling parameter is divided into discrete chunks [1] 

and 

the (cid:147)chunkiness(cid:148) arises as a matter of logical necessity from the foundation 
postulates. 

 
The narrative will progress through the following stages: 
 
Stage (i) (cid:150) Articulation of the foundation postulates (section 2). This is an arbitrary 
act whose sole justification derives from the potential usefulness of the 
resultant spacetime construct. 

 
Stage (ii) (cid:150) A consistency analysis. This procedure provides confidence that 

paradoxes cannot be derived from the foundation postulates. 

 
Stage (iii) (cid:150) Construction of the novel spacetime geometry. This mathematical model-
building exercise establishes a geometry with intrinsic quantum character. 

 
Stage (iv) (cid:150) Assessment of physical relevance. This assessment of the novel   

spacetime involves  

the derivation of equations of mainstream quantum mechanics as a 
consequence of particular spacetime structure parameters 
the generation of testable predictions which differ from mainstream theory, 
for example in relation to the existence of Higgs particles  
an exploration of the notion that quantum particles exist as spatially extended 
moieties (strings, membranes) as a consequence of particular spacetime 
structure parameters  
an exploration of problems associated with the use of the new geometry.

The Five Foundation Postulates 

2) 
 
 
For purposes of exposition, the focus will be on (1 + 1) spacetime (cid:150) a commentary on 
the generalization to higher spatial dimensions is provided in Appendix 10.  
 
The first foundation postulate is that a reference    (1 + 1) spacetime exists, that the 
ensemble of reference coordinates for the spacetime can be denoted Σr (tr , xr) and that 
inertial observers move at constant velocity v in Σr . In other words the world line of 
an inertial observer in Σr is (T, f(T)) with f = vT + b. Natural units, in which c = 1 will 
be taken for granted. 
 
The second foundation postulate is that each inertial observer in Σr establishes a line 
of simultaneity relevant to himself through events (T, f(T)) on his world line 
according to the gradient relation

(line of simultaneity) = v = 

 . 

df
dT

 
The third foundation postulate is that a clock carried by an inertial observer runs slow 
at (T, f(T)) by a factor (1 (cid:150) v2)‰ .  
 
The fourth foundation postulate is that provided a pair of events (t1 , x1) and (t2 , x2) 
lies on one of his lines of simultaneity, an inertial observer can assign a distance of 
separation according to the relation

The above four postulates provide rules according to which inertial observers can 
construct the spacetime of relevance to themselves. The postulates lead to Minkowski 
spacetime as shown in Appendix 1. 
 
The fifth foundation postulate is that accelerated observers can construct a spacetime 
of relevance to themselves using the same procedures as inertial observers. Since the 
velocity of an accelerated observer may be continuously variable, the velocity term in 
the second and third postulates is taken to be the instantaneous velocity at (T, f(T)) 
given by  
 

v(T)=df(T)/dT.  

 
Clearly for accelerated observers, f is a non-linear function of T (cid:150)  Appendix 2 
provides further commentary relating to f(T). Henceforth the term moving observer 
will be used to cover accelerated and inertial observers, and the expression (T, f(T)) 
will always be used to describe the world line in Σr of the moving observer that is the 
object of study.

The Five Foundation Postulates: A Consistency Analysis  

3) 
 
 
 
Routine efforts to construct a spacetime from the above foundation postulates quickly 
founder in paradox and inconsistency as will now be shown. The key equations 
arising from the five postulates are closely related to the equations presented in 
Appendix 1. The equation for the line of simultaneity in Σr constructed by the moving 
observer through (T, f(T)) is 
 
 

(tr (cid:150) T) / (xr (cid:150) f(T)) = v(T) = df/dT                  (3.1) 

 
 
Other equations of Appendix 1, adapted for moving rather than inertial observers are

Equation (3.2) relates the reference coordinate system Σr(tr , xr) to the coordinate 
system constructed by the moving observer Σm(tm , xm).  Σm will henceforth be 
referred to as the moving spacetime. This equation has been anticipated by Born and 
Biem [10] and reviewed by Crampin, McCrea and McNally [11]. Equation (3.2) will 
henceforth be denoted the amended Lorentz transformation, and equation (3.2) 
contains(3.1). A commentary on the utilisation of equation (3.2) is provided in 
Appendix 3.  
 
 
 
Consider the moving observer described below in Figure 1. The shown (broken) lines 
of simultaneity constructed by this observer are not parallel and intersect at some    
(tr’, xr’) in Σr .

It follows (see Appendices 3, 4 for further details) that the amended Lorentz 
transformation from Σm(tm , xm) to Σr(tr , xr) is a three-to-one transformation at (tr’, xr’). 
This is a profoundly inconsistent result, as paradoxes can readily be constructed when 
non-unique inverse coordinate transformations exist. The appearance of this type of  
inconsistency has been noted in passing by Crampin et al.[11] and Misner et al[12]. 
The intersection of the lines of simultaneity is always more or less remote from the 
moving observer(cid:146)s world line. 
 
Resolution of Inconsistency 
 
An apparently inconsistent set of axioms in geometry can be made consistent if an 
appropriate model is provided.  For example in plane geometry, if Euclid(cid:146)s parallel 
axiom is replaced with an axiom that asserts the existence of many distinct parallel 
lines, the geometry is inconsistent. However as is well known, a saddle provides an 
appropriate model in which consistency can be restored.  
 
It will now be shown that a folded rubber sheet provides an appropriate model for 
the moving spacetime generated by the five foundation axioms. The reference 
coordinate system Σr(tr , xr) contains two independent continuous parameters and can 
therefore be inscribed on a flat 2-dimensional surface (a floor). The moving 
coordinate system Σm(tm , xm) defined by the amended Lorentz transformation (3.2) 
also contains two independent continuous parameters and can be inscribed on a highly 
flexible, thin rubber sheet. A continuous mapping from Σm to Σr as defined in (3.2) 
can be physically represented by stretching or otherwise deforming the inscribed 
rubber sheet over the inscribed floor in such a way that each (tm , xm) on the sheet lies 
directly over the corresponding (tr , xr) on the floor. The (apparently inconsistent) 
many-to-one mapping from Σm to Σr can be visualized as a folding of the rubber sheet 
over itself in such a way that (multiple) coordinates of Σm inscribed on the sheet lie 
directly over the corresponding reference coordinate inscribed on the floor.  
 
The folded sheet model for the moving spacetime Σm defined by the amended Lorentz 
transformation (3.2) will now be discussed in further detail because it provides a 
framework for the emergence of intrinsic quantum character.

The amended Lorentz transformation (3.2) can be written in the form  
 

(tr , xr) = M(tm, xm) 

 

(3.3) 

 
where M is the amended Lorentz operator. Instructions on the practical use of M are 
implicit in Appendix 3. An inverse amended Lorentz operator M-1 with  
 

M-1(tr , xr) = (tm , xm)    

(3.4) 

 
can be formally defined from (3.3) in the following way: Fix a reference coordinate   
(tr , xr) in (3.3) and scan the entire moving coordinate system Σm for an event (tm , xm) 
which satisfies (3.3). The above discussion relating to the many-to-one nature of the 
operator M shows that in general a set of moving coordinates will correspond to a 
particular reference coordinate under M. Let this set, which is of great significance, be 
designated the destination set D(tr , xr), where (tr , xr)is the destination coordinate in 
Σr. Then (3.4) can be amended to  
 

M-1(tr , xr) = D(tr , xr)   

(3.5) 

 
and the order of the set D denoted #D provides quantitative information on the many-
to-one nature of M. The operator N defined by  
 

N(D) = #D 

 

 

(3.6) 

 
counts the number of elements in D. For the scenario of Figure 1, N(D(tr’ , xr’)) = 3.  
 
 
Figure 2 provides a qualitative plan and cross-sectional view of a segment of a folded 
rubber sheet superposed over a floor. The cross-section, denoted a folding diagram, is 
particularly instructive, and Figure 3 provides two samples of folding diagrams with 
annotations that clarify the destination set D in each case. Figure 3(a) bears some 
resemblance to diagrams of branes provided by Arkani-Hamed et al.[13] in a popular 
account of possible topological configurations for the universe.

A perusal of Figure 3 suggests that the following seven features are defining features 
for folded sheet configurations. 
 
F1:   Each sheet coordinate is mapped to precisely one floor coordinate.  
 
F2:  Neighbouring regions in the sheet are mapped to neighbouring regions in the

F3:   Each floor coordinate corresponds to at least one coordinate in the sheet. 
 
F4:   An odd number of sheet coordinates correspond to a given floor coordinate. 
For example, one sheet coordinate corresponds to a given floor coordinate in 
the unfolded section of sheet in figures 3a, 3b. Three sheet coordinates 
correspond to a given floor coordinate in the folded section of sheet in Figure 
3(a) and five sheet coordinates correspond to a given floor coordinate in the 
folded section of sheet in figure 3(b) (cid:150) see also Appendix 5. 

For the set of sheet coordinates which are mapped to a single floor coordinate, 
it is possible to rank the members of the set according to the position of each 
member in the stack of folds. The element of rank 1 may be taken to be the 
sheet coordinate on the bottom of the stack of folds. The element of rank 2 is 
on the adjacent layer, and so on to the top of the stack.

F6:   Given a floor coordinate and an appropriate positive integer s, (to be 

designated the stacking integer) it is possible to precisely specify a unique 
corresponding sheet coordinate.  

 
F7:   Given an initial sheet coordinate, it is possible to establish both the 

corresponding floor coordinate and also the stacking integer s of the initial 
coordinate. The process is as follows: Establish the destination set D 
comprising all the sheet coordinates which are mapped to the same floor 
coordinate. Then count through the stack of folds to establish the rank of the 
initial coordinate in D.  

 
The introduction of the stacking integer foreshadows the emergence of quantum 
character in a spacetime. Features F6, F7 foreshadow a scenario in which a one-to-one 
correspondence between reference and moving event labelling systems is achieved. 
 
Folded Sheets Provide a Model for the Moving Spacetime Σm Described by the 
Amended Lorentz Transformation 
 
It will now be shown that the seven defining features of folded sheet configurations 
can be identified in the amended Lorentz transformation (3.2). The demonstration 
involves  
 
(a) 

tracking the features F1 (cid:150) F7 and replacing the term (cid:147)sheet coordinate(cid:148) with 
(cid:147)moving coordinate(cid:148) and the term (cid:147)floor coordinate(cid:148) with (cid:147)reference 
coordinate(cid:148). 

and 
 

 

 

(b)  proving that the resulting statements are true for coordinates related by the 

amended Lorentz equation (3.2). Several keen insights provided by Crampin et 
al.[11] are important in the demonstration. 

F1 (amended Lorentz): Each moving coordinate (tm , xm) corresponds to precisely one 
reference coordinate (tr , xr). This follows from (3.2) and (3.3). 

 
F2 (amended Lorentz): Neighbouring regions in Σm(tm , xm) are mapped to 

neigbouring regions in Σr(tr , xr). This follows from (3.2) and (3.3) since γ, 
v, T, f are well-behaved functions of tm when │v│<1 (cid:150) ε (small positive 
ε). 

 
F3 (amended Lorentz): Each reference coordinate (tr , xr) corresponds to at least one 

moving coordinate (tm , xm). This result has been proved by Crampin et al. 
[11]. 

 
F4 (amended Lorentz): An odd number of distinct moving coordinates in Σm 

correspond(s) to each individual reference coordinate (tr , xr). This non-
obvious result has been proved by Crampin et al. [11]. 

 
F5 (amended Lorentz): For the set of moving coordinates D(tr , xr) whose elements 
are mapped to a single reference coordinate (tr , xr) under the amended

Lorentz transformation (3.2), it is possible to establish a ranking of the set. 
It is sufficient to prove that all moving coordinates in D have different tm 
values (cid:150) then the various (tm , xm) in D can be ranked by ranking the tm 
values. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that (tm , xm’) and (tm , xm") 
are distinct members of the destination set D(tr , xr) with identical tm 
values, i.e. xm’ ≠ xm". It follows that (tm , xm’) ↔ (tr , xr) ↔ (tm , xm"), 
where ↔ indicates correspondence under equation (3.2). Elementary 
algebra of substitution leads to  xm’ = xm" qed. That moving coordinate in 
D with the lowest tm value can be assigned rank 1, the second lowest rank 
2, and so on up to the coordinate of highest rank #D (see 3.6). The rank of 
each element of D is a integer s with 1 ≤ s ≤ #D and this integer is 
designated the stacking integer. 

Using these concepts it is feasible to define a ranking operator RD which 
takes as its input a destination set D and an element of that destination set 
(tm , xm). The output of the ranking operator will be the rank s (which is the 
same as the stacking integer) of   (tm , xm) in D,    i.e. 

RD(tm , xm) = s           1 ≤ s ≤ #D  . 

 

(3.7) 

It is also feasible to define another operator Rs which takes as its input a 
particular stacking integer s as well as a particular destination set D. The 
output of this operator is the moving coordinate (tm , xm) in D with rank s, 
i.e.  

Rs(D) = (tm , xm) 

 

(3.8) 

 
F6 (amended Lorentz): Given a reference (tr , xr) in Σr and a stacking integer s, the 
corresponding unique (tm , xm) in Σm is given by the operation 

Rs (M-1(tr , xr)) = (tm , xm) 

(3.9) 

 

 

 

 

since M-1 identifies the destination set D (see 3.5 and associated 
discussion) and Rs selects the element of D with rank s (see 3.7). 

 
F7 (amended Lorentz): Given a moving coordinate (tm , xm) in Σm the corresponding 
reference coordinate (tr , xr) in Σr is given by (tr , xr) = M(tm , xm) (see 3.3 
and associated discussion). The destination set D(tr , xr) is given by 
expression (3.5) and the corresponding stacking integer s is provided by 
the operation RD(tm , xm) = s (see discussion associated with 3.7). 

This concludes the demonstration that a folded sheet provides a model for the moving 
spacetime Σm generated by the five foundation postulates.  
 
4)  

Construction of the Novel Spacetime Geometry  

 
It has been shown that the specification of both a reference coordinate in Σr and a 
stacking integer s suffices to establish a unique corresponding moving coordinate in 
Σm and vice versa. On this basis

(tr , xr), s ↔ (tm , xm)    

 

(4.1)  

 
where ↔ indicates the one-to-one nature of the mapping. It follows from (4.1) that if 
we are prepared to assign a label of the type (tr , xr , s) to each event in reference 
spacetime, then a one-to-one correspondence can be found between reference event 
labels and moving coordinates (cid:150) the ensemble of all such event labelings will be 
designated  as the reference event labeling system Lr(tr , xr , s), and clearly 
 

Lr(tr , xr , s) ↔ Σm(tm , xm) 

 

(4.2) 

 
From (4.2) it can be seen that the reference event labeling system Lr has intrinsic 
quantum character. 

 

 

However whilst the one-to-one mapping (4.2) has been established between a moving 
coordinate system and a reference event labeling system, the provision of a one-to-
one mapping between two different moving coordinate systems remains problematic, 
as is apparent in the following scenario: Figure 3(a) provides a folding diagram (one 
fold) for a segment of a particular moving observer(cid:146)s coordinate system (cid:150) call this 
observer Bill. Figure 3(b) provides a folding diagram (2 folds) for a segment of a 
different moving observer(cid:146)s coordinate system (cid:150) call this observer Sue. One would 
hope to provide a one-to-one mapping between Bill(cid:146)s and Sue(cid:146)s coordinate systems 
according to the scheme 
 

Σm’(tm’ , xm’) ↔ Lr(tr , xr , s) ↔ Σm"(tm" , xm") 
 
 
     Bill        

       Sue 

 

(4.3) 

 
But this is not possible because of domain inconsistency (cid:150) the domain of s in             
(tr , xr , s) depends on the number of moving coordinates which map to (tr , xr). For 
Bill, s belongs to the domain {1, 2, 3} whereas for Sue, s belongs to the domain                 
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (cid:150) see figures 3(a) and 3(b). 
 
Resolution of Domain Inconsistency  
 
It is fruitful to take the reference event labelling system Lr(tr , xr , s) wherein the 
domain of s is finite, and to extend it to create an enlarged reference event labelling 
system Lr(tr , xr , sr), wherein the domain of sr is the (infinite) set of all positive 
integers. It is further fruitful to take the moving coordinate system Σm(tm , xm) and 
extend it to create an enlarged moving event labelling system Lm(tm , xm , sm) wherein 
the domain of sm is the set of all positive integers. 
 
It will now be shown that a one-to-one mapping can be constructed between the 
enlarged entities Lr and Lm such that  
 

(a) 

the mapping collapses to the amended Lorentz transformation (3.2) when the 
stacking integers sr , sm are suppressed, and  

 
(b)  domain inconsistency can be avoided.

The Mapping of Lm(tm , xm , sm) to Lr(tr , xr , sr) 
 
Consider that tm , xm , sm have been given. Then (tr , xr , sr) can be specified using the 
following procedure: 
 

Enter tm , xm into equation (3.2) to get the corresponding (tr , xr) values. 

Establish the destination set D(tr , xr), the order of the destination set #D 
and the rank s of (tm , xm) in D. This involves equations (3.5), (3.6) and 
(3.7). 

Establish sr using the equation  

sr = (sm (cid:150) 1)#D + s    1 ≤ s ≤ #D 

 

 

(4.4) 

 
This completes the specification of (tr , xr , sr) from (tm , xm , sm). 
 
The Mapping Lr(tr , xr , sr) to Lm(tm , xm , sm) 
 
Consider that tr , xr , sr have been given. Then tm , xm , sm can be specified using the 
following procedure: 
 

Enter tr , xr into equation (3.5) to establish the destination set D(tr , xr), and 
use (3.6) to establish #D. 

Divide sr by #D according to the modified Euclid equation 

sr = (sm (cid:150) 1)#D + s         

1 ≤ s ≤ #D

The quotient sm (cid:150) 1 provides the value of sm and the remainder s provides the rank of 
 , xm) in D. Use the (tm , xm) of this unique element to complete 
a unique element (tm
the mapping. 
 
This completes the specification of (tm , xm , sm) from (tr , xr , sr).  
 
On the basis of the above mappings from Lm to Lr and vice versa, it is now possible to 
write. 
 

 Lm(tm , xm , sm) ↔ Lr(tr , xr , sr) 

 

 

(4.6) 

 
and it can be confirmed that (3.2) is recovered when sm and sr are suppressed in (4.6). 
For different moving observers with event labelling systems Lm’ and Lm" respectively, 
a one-to-one mapping can be established according to the scheme 
 

Lm’(tm’ , xm’ , sm’) ↔ Lr(tr , xr , sr) ↔ Lm"(tm" , xm" , sm")  

(4.7) 

 
and the domain inconsistency problem on sr has been overcome.

We now have a reference event labelling system Lr with intrinsic quantum character, 
and a one-to-one mapping to moving event labelling systems, each also with intrinsic 
quantum character.  
 
Review 
 
The context for equation (4.6) is as follows: Events in the novel flat spacetime 
construct must be described using event labels of the form (t, x, s) where (t, x) are 
familiar (continuous) parameters and s, the stacking integer, is a positive integer. Only 
then can the five foundation postulates be applied in a consistent manner, i.e. only 
then can accelerated observers establish wide-ranging, Lorentz-invariant and trouble-
free spacetime geometries of relevance to themselves.  
 
The analysis so far has been guided by the resolve to eliminate inconsistencies 
associated with the fifth foundation postulate. Accordingly, many of the concepts 
introduced along the way have a mathematical rather than a physical character. 
However the key issue is whether the resultant spacetime construct is of relevance to 
physical theory. This issue is pursued vigorously in the next section and involves, in 
part, a dialogue on the role of the stacking integers in physical theory.  
 
There is some basis for optimism. The pathway from accelerated observer scenarios 
to gravity theory is well known, and now, for the first time, a pathway has been 
developed from another class of accelerated observer scenarios to a spacetime with 
intrinsic quantum character. This suggests there is scope to diminish the conceptual 
divide between gravity theory and quantum mechanics.   
 
 
5) 
 
 
Consider a moving inertial event-labelling system Lm(tm , xm , sm) which is in one-to-
one correspondence with the reference labelling Lr(tr , xr , sr) according to the 
mappings from Lm
 is inertial, there are no intersecting lines of simultaneity  of the sort encountered in 
Lm
Figure 1, and it follows that the order of the destination set D defined in equation (3.5) 
is unity at each destination coordinate (tr , xr). Then equation (4.4) collapses to sm = sr, 
and in the mapping     Lm(tm , xm , sm) ↔ Lr(tr , xr , sr) it can be seen that (tr , xr) and 
(tm , xm) are related by the conventional Lorentz transformation, i.e. equation (3.2) 
with f = vT + b. In other words, Lm(tm , xm , sm) can be visualised as an infinite stack 
of Minkowski spacetimes mounted over each other, one for each sm .  
 
All further analysis in this article will involve a simple inertial event labelling system 
of the above sort, which for convenience in notation will be designated L(t, x, s). Of 
course the perspective of accelerated observers can be recovered at will by using the 
transformations outlined in the previous sections.  
 
It may be noted in passing that all the constructions of mainstream physics can be 
carried out at each and any stacking integer in L(t, x, s) (cid:150) this shows that all of 
conventional physics can be expressed in the new spacetime. However the 
confinement of physics to stacking integers which do not communicate with each 

 to Lr and vice versa described in section 4, equation (4.6). Since

other adds nothing to physical theory. The agenda which will now be addressed is to 
embed physical theory in L(t, x, s) in such a way that

6)       Structure-Determining Parameters in the Novel Spacetime L(t, x, s) 
 
 
It is postulated that the spacetime L(t, x, s) is populated with swarms of messenger 
entities which  
 

•  have trivial point-particle morphology  
• 
• 

travel only at the speed of light (unity in natural units)  
can be readily created or destroyed but which, once created, are destined to 
remain on a fixed stacking integer. 

 
Messenger entities, which are not to be identified with photons or other particles of 
physics, can be visualised as idealised points travelling on the null lines of the 
spacetime L(t, x, s) at a fixed value of the stacking integer s. They are the simplest 
conceivable dynamical entity in the novel spacetime (see also Appendix 6). 
Information on the population of messenger entities in L is contained in a messenger 
entity distribution function of the form n(t, x, s).  
 
It is now possible to establish structure parameters for the spacetime L(t, x, s) in terms 
of constraints on messenger entity behavior. The contemplation of structure-
determining parameters marks an important transition in this work from an analysis of 
mathematical consistency to an analysis of physics. 
 
The following aspects of spacetime structure are of particular importance: Causal 
structure, superposition structure and coupling structure. All these aspects of 
spacetime structure arise because s has been adopted as an event labeling parameter. 
 
6.1 
 
The constraint that messenger entities always travel at a speed of unity (natural units) 
allows us to distinguish 4 types of messenger entity denoted A-entities, B-entities,    
C-entities and D-entities (see Figure 4).

If all types of messenger entity were available on each stacking integer, signaling 
strategies could be developed that would allow an observer to signal himself-in-the-
past, and causal paradox would ensue [14,15]. It is feasible to insist that A-entities are 
confined to every fourth stacking integer  s = 4k (cid:150)3,  where k is a positive integer. 
Similarly B-entities may be confined to s = 4k (cid:150) 2,    C-entities to s = 4k (cid:150) 1 and      
D-entities to s = 4k. Then a causal structure (one of many possibilities) has been 
imposed on the spacetime L in the sense that causal paradox on a stacking integer has 
been ruled out. Furthermore a radical simplification has been introduced since any 
stacking integer can only host one type of messenger entity. The causal structure 
described above can be represented by the following mapping: 
 

stacking integer 
 
s = 4k (cid:150) 3  
 
s = 4k (cid:150) 2    
 
s = 4k (cid:150)1   
 
s = 4k

and in general, the causal structure parameters for a spacetime L will consist of a 
mapping from the set of stacking integers to the set {A, B, C, D}. 
 
Messenger entities are described by the distribution function n(t, x, s) (cid:150) for the causal 
structure parameters described in (6.1), the distribution A(t, x) of all A-entities in the

Superposition Structure  

 
6.2 
 
Messenger entities at the same (t, x) in the spacetime L(t, x, s) but with different s 
values are taken to superpose in some sense. One example (among many possibilities) 
is that superposition takes place in the sense of vector-addition-in-a-plane according 
to the following superposition structure : 
 
messenger entity 
A-entities  
B-entities 
C-entities  
D-entities  
 
 
Then the superposition over all stacking integers of the messenger entity distribution 
n(t, x, s) is given by the vector V with  
 

superposition vector (Argand representation) 
v(s) =   1     
v(s) =   i     
v(s) =  (cid:150) 1    
v(s) =  (cid:150) i     
 

stacking integer 
s = 4k (cid:150)3 
s = 4k (cid:150)2   
s = 4k (cid:150)1 
s = 4k

V(t, x) = (cid:1)

n(t, x, s)v(s)

=1s

(6.5) 

and from (6.2) and (6.4) we can write  

V = A (cid:150) C + i(B (cid:150) D)   

(6.6) 

 

 

 

 

The likelihood of finding messenger entities at (t, x) can be taken to be proportional to 
│V│2 which leads to the identification of V with the conventional wavefunction ψ. 

In a more general scenario, the superposition structure parameters for a spacetime L 
can consist of any mapping v(s) from the stacking integers s to vectors-in-a-plane v 
(see also Appendix 11).

6.3 

Coupling Structure 

Coupling structure in the spacetime L(t, x, s) arises when messenger entities at one 
stacking integer sj can influence the population of messenger entities at another 
stacking integer si . One example (among many possibilities) is that a messenger 
entity at (t, x, s (cid:150) 1) can induce the creation of a new messenger entity at (t, x, s) with 
induction frequency w. Based on this coupling structure, the evolution of the 
messenger entity distribution n(t, x, s) proceeds according to the equation.

More generally, the coupling structure parameters for a spacetime L consist of a 
mapping W(t, x, si , sj ) which describes  the frequency W with which a messenger 
entity at (t, x, sj ) induces the creation/destruction of a messenger entity at (t, x, si ).

relationship has been established between the rest mass term m0 and the coupling 
structure parameter w.

Structure Parameters which Generate Schroedinger’s Equation

by equation (6.1), and the superposition structure parameters are provided by the 
mapping   

(s = 4k (cid:150) 3) → 1 , (s = 4k (cid:150) 2) → 1 , (s = 4k (cid:150) 1) → i ,   (s = 4k) → i .

Consider further that the coupling structure parameters are given by the following 
function W(t, x, si, sj) wherein w is a scalar but q can depend on (t, x). 

 

s = 4k (cid:150) 3   W(t, x, s, s (cid:150) 2) = q (cid:150) w

9) 

The Origin of Rest Mass 

The results of sections 7 and 8 relate to a very small part of quantum theory, however 
a template has been provided which supports the following assertion : in the novel 
spacetime construct, a theory of massless particles (messenger entities) can be 
formulated, and coupling behavior between the stacking integers of the spacetime acts 
to give rise to rest mass terms in the system equation. This assertion can be compared 
with the following statement of mainstream quantum theory [16]: In the Standard 
Model, the underlying field theory may be formulated in terms of massless particles, 
and coupling with the Higgs field in the vacuum acts to give rise to rest mass terms in 
the system equation.  

On the basis of the above analogy, it is proposed that the mechanism of coupling 
between stacking integers in the novel spacetime can replace the mechanism of 
coupling with the Higgs field in the vacuum of the Standard Model. If this is true, 
then rest mass terms can arise without the existence of Higgs particles. A key 
prediction of the new spacetime theory is therefore that Higgs particles will not be 
found. This prediction is one of the most decidable (in due course) points of 
difference with mainstream quantum theory. The prediction, which in its present form 
is made on an unfinished-theory basis, will be more credible when it is shown that the 
equations of the Standard Model can be recovered in the novel spacetime on the basis

of a specific set of structure-determining parameters for the spacetime. This issue will 
be addressed in a forthcoming publication. Higgs particles have thus far not been 
discovered, although many believe that discovery is imminent. A recent review of the 
key Higgs-related experimental and theoretical issues has been provided by Zwirner 
[17].  

10)  Structure Parameters which Generate Non-trivial Metric Effects 

The following analysis relates to structure parameters that provide variable speed 
limits for information transfer in the spacetime L(t, x, s). It will be useful to retain all 
of the features of messenger entities introduced in section 5, with the important 
exception that messenger entities will be allowed to jump from one stacking integer to 
another.   

Consider a scenario in L(t, x, s) where attention is focused on the doublet of stacking 
integers s0 and s0 + 1. Suppose that the causal structure parameters are given by the 
mapping s0 → A and s0 + 1 → B (see Figure 4). Consider that a typical A-entity on s0 
can jump to s0 + 1 where it becomes a B-entity. This can be represented by an A-
entity annihilation at (t, x, s0) in conjunction with B-entity creation at (t, x, s0 + 1). 
Consider further that a typical B-entity on s0 + 1 can jump to s0 where it becomes an 
A-entity.  

The above scenario is illustrated in Figure 5 in terms of (a) a transition frequency (or 
jumping) diagram and (b) an average trajectory diagram for a messenger entity.

From Figure 5a, the jumping frequency from s0 to s0 + 1 is p (light metres -1) and so 
the average residence time of the A-entity on s0 is p-1 (light metres). The jumping 
frequency from s0+1 to s0 is k (light metres-1) and so the average residence time of the 
B-entity on s0+1 is k-1 (light metres). Messenger entity jumping in the above model 
proceeds according to the scheme s0 → s0+1 → s0 → s0+1 → etc. In Figure 5(b) it is 
shown that the average messenger entity trajectory consists of a sawtooth function 
consistent with the transition of A-entities on s0 to B-entities on s0+1 and back again 
(see figure 4). If p, k are very large, the sawtooth function closely approximates a 
straight line whose gradient may differ greatly from c = 1. More details are provided 
in Appendix 11. The point of this scenario is that a coupling structure (based on the 
parameters p, k) can be imposed on the spacetime in a way which leads to a speed 
limit for information transfer which is not unity. This result suggests that a non-trivial

metric structure can be imposed on the novel spacetime by a judicious choice of 
coupling structure parameters.

Structure Parameters which Generate Quantum Particles as Spatially 
Extended Moieties  

A core concept of string theory/M theory is that quantum particles are spatially 
extended and trace out a world sheet or world volume rather than a world line in 
spacetime. Greene [18] has spoken of the lack of fundamental principle which 
requires spatially extended particles to exist. It will be shown in the following 
scenario that a coupling structure can be imposed on the novel spacetime which leads 
to the appearance of quantum particles as spatially extended moieties.  

Figure 6 illustrates a scenario in which messenger entities jump between a quartet of 
stacking integers according to the scheme A-entity on s0 → B-entity on s0+1 → C-
entity on s0+3 → D-entity on s0+4 → A-entity on s0 → etc.

In Figure 6a, the jumping frequency is k (light metres-1) and the average residence 
time at each stacking integer is k-1 (light metres). As the messenger entity progresses 
from s0 (A-entity) to s0 +1 (B-entity) etc its motion changes according to the options 
shown in Figure (4). The average residence time on each stacking integer is the same, 
and the average trajectory is shown in Fig 6b. In intuitive terms, the average trajectory 
consists of a re-circulating loop in spacetime. More details are provided in    
Appendix 11. The point of this scenario is that a coupling structure can be imposed on 
the novel spacetime which gives messenger entities some sort of non-local character 
as provided in figure 6b. 
 
 
The above argument can be extended to provide a more convincing string-like 
scenario as follows. Consider a sextuplet of stacking integers s0, s0 + 1(cid:133). s0 + 5 for 
which the causal structure parameters are s0 → A, s0 + 1 → A, s0 + 2 → B,                 
s0 + 3 → C, s0 + 4 → D, s0 + 5 → A.  Figure 7(a) provides the appropriate transition

11)The Arrow of Time 
 
In Appendix 8 equation (A8.1) and its correlates when s = 4k (cid:150) 2, s = 4k (cid:150) 1 and s = 
4k are presented for the evolution of the messenger entity distribution n(t, x, s), and it 
is shown that these equations collapse to the Klein-Gordon equation (7.1). The Klein-
Gordon equation is invariant under the transformation          t →  (cid:150) t, however for 
equation (A8.1) and its correlates the situation is different. In this equation the term 
t∂  = wn(t, x, s (cid:150) 1) describes the process whereby messenger entities at     
∂ n(t, x, s)/
s (cid:150) 1 induce the creation of new messenger entities at s. This induction process can go 
on forever in a time-forwards direction since there is always a higher stacking integer 
to populate. However it cannot go on in a time-backwards direction because there is 
no stacking integer less than 1. This argument illustrates the potential of the novel 
spacetime construct to provide a foundation for a formalism in which the arrow of 
time is manifest.  
 
 
12)   Problems Associated with the Use of the Novel Flat Spacetime Construct 
 

 
•  The conceptual simplicity of the folded sheet model in (1 + 1) spacetime is lost 
in (3 + 1) spacetime (or higher), because folded hyperplanes are difficult to 
imagine. However as shown in Appendix 10, a higher dimensional formalism 
can be developed using the destination set concept.   

 
• 

 

 

• 

In higher spatial dimensions, the simple plus-minus directionality of messenger 
entity trajectories articulated in Figure 4 is lost. A basis for generalisation is 
provided in Appendix 10. 

•  For the novel spacetime to provide a solid and non-trivial basis for physical 
theory, a plethora of well-known results in field theory, metric tensor theory, 
spin theory etc need to be recovered in a context where all the rest mass terms 
arise as a result of messenger entity coupling between various stacking integers. 
While there can be no a priori assurance that this agenda can be completed, 
there is enormous freedom to select structure determining parameters (see 
Appendix 11 and the discussion of section 6). Some of these degrees of 
freedom to define spacetime structure may find other uses, for example in 
cosmology.  

 A small class of accelerated world lines has been excluded from the formalism 
of sections 2 and 3 because these world lines lead to pathological results (see 
Appendix 12). Physics can be carried out without reference to these 
pathological world lines, however an inclusive framework would be preferable. 
Suggestions for achieving this inclusive framework are provided in     
Appendix 12.  

 

 
13)      Some Points of Correspondence With DSR Theory 
 
 
Double Special Relativity (DSR) theory and the theory developed in this work extend 
mainstream theory in different directions and will be judged by their capacity to

account for experimental results. However there are significant points of 
correspondence between the two theories which may inform further work: 
 
Both theories are theories of flat spacetime with a quantum aspect. Both have been 
developed by taking a set of non-standard postulates, resolving the consistency issues, 
and developing a spacetime construct in which Minkowski spacetime appears as a 
special case. 
 
 
14)  Conclusion  
 
 
It appears possible that the novel spacetime construct introduced in this work can 
contribute to the understanding of physical phenomena in the following terms: 
 

It is predicted that Higgs particles will not be found. 

It has been shown that equations of mainstream quantum mechanics can arise 
as a result of appropriately selected spacetime structure parameters. 

It has been shown that quantum particles can appear as spatially extended 
moieties (such as membranes or strings) as a result of appropriately selected 
spacetime structure parameters.  

Indicative evidence has been provided that both potential fields (see section 8) 
and non-trivial metrics (see section 10) can be introduced by appropriately 
selecting spacetime structure parameters. This suggests a common origin, and 
also suggests that the novel quantum geometry may facilitate unification.

with f = vT + b 

(A1.1)

(T, f(T)) which lie on the above line of simultaneity.

Fourth Foundation Postulate:

(A1.5) 

 
Square both sides of (A1.2) and use the result to substitute for (tr (cid:150) T)2 in (A1.5). 
The result is  

xr = f(T) + γxm 

 

(A1.6) 

 
Use (A1.6) and substitute for xr (cid:150) f(T) in (A1.2), the result is  

 
tr = T + γvxm   

(A1.7) 

 
Use (A1.4) to substitute for T in (A1.7). The result is 
 

tr (cid:150) T0 = γ(tm + vxm) 

 

(A1.8) 

 
 
Use (A1.1) to substitute for f in (A1.6) and then (A1.4) to substitute for T. Then 
 

xr (cid:150) (vT0 + b) = γ(xm + vtm) 

 

(A1.9) 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

Equations (A1.8), (A1.9) constitute the conventional inhomogeneous Lorentz 
equation, and whilst the velocity of the moving observer in Σr is v, the velocity of the 
reference observer in Σm is (cid:150)v.

Appendix 2  
 
Constraints on f(T) 

 
Let u and v be finite integers. It is assumed that f(T) can be defined on u joined 
segments covering the domain of T, and that on each segment, f(T) can be represented 
by a vth degree polynomial in T. The polynomials can be chosen so that f(T) and 
derivatives thereof necessary for use in physical equations are continuous.  
 
The above constraints on f(T) allow any physically relevant world line in 
described with any desired degree of precision. (cid:150) see also Appendix 12.

The Amended Lorentz Transformation 

 
Equation (3.2) should be understood from the point of view of a moving observer who 
 

(a)  consults his wristwatch to determine the parameter tm , 
(b) derives the world line parameter T using equation (3.2c) (cid:150) in general 

numerical inversion will be required, 

(c)  establishes his line of simultaneity through (T, f(T)) in 

rΣ  according to the 

second foundation postulate, 

(d) selects a value for the distance parameter xm , and 
(e)  identifies an event (tr , xr) corresponding to xm on the above line of 

simultaneity according to the third foundation postulate. 

 
The above process provides an operational definition for finding (tr , xr) from (tm , xm) 
and it is important to note that for each (tm , xm) there is one and only one 
corresponding (tr , xr). 
 
The reverse process (cid:150) finding (tm , xm) from (tr , xr) is more complex, and in effect 
involves guessing (tm , xm) values and running through the above process until the   
(tm , xm) are found which map to (tr , xr). 

Appendix 4 

 Commentary on Figure 1 

 
A simple relationship exists between the gradient of the world line tangent at           
(T, f(T)), and the gradient of the line of simultaneity through (T, f(T)) (cid:150) see equation 
(3.1). The relationship is  
 

gradient, line of simultaneity = (gradient, tangent to world line)-1. 
 

In other words, the line of simultaneity can be drawn in Figure 1 by reflecting the 
world line tangent through the null line containing (T, f(T)).

Each of the three distinct lines of simultaneity in Figure 1 containing the event          
(tr’ , xr’) corresponds to a distinct moving event coordinate which is mapped to (tr’ , xr’) 
under the amended Lorentz transformation (see also Appendix 3).  
 
 

Appendix 5 
  
Commentary on Conditions at the Extremity of a Fold 

 
In conventional geometry, when a line intersects a circle there are two points of 
intersection, except in the case of a tangent, where there is one. However it can be 
asserted (and justified by solving the simultaneous equations of circle and line) that a 
tangent touches the circle twice at the one point. An extension of this idea can be used 
to assert that even at the extreme point of the fold in figures such as Figure 3, an odd 
number of moving co-ordinates correspond to a given reference co-ordinate under the 
amended Lorentz transformation (3.2). 
 
 

Appendix 6  
 
Messenger Entities as Excitations of Spacetime 

 
Messenger entities can be comprehended as ultra-simple dynamical entities which are 
inserted into the spacetime L(t, x, s),  however it is also conceivable that messenger 
entities are primitive excitations of spacetime itself . One advantage of the latter 
approach is that the excitations may naturally appear with a range of positive or 
negative amplitudes (useful in accounting for field theories). Where various types of 
particle (e.g. photons, electrons) coexist in a system under study, the corresponding 
messenger entities are confined to distinct stacking integers.

Propagation Equations 
 

Consider a time dependent distribution n(t, x) of the form n(t, x) = g(x (cid:150) kt), which 
represents the translation of g(x) along the x-axis at velocity k. The equation of

Generalization to Higher Spatial Dimensions 

(A9.7) 

 
(a) Destination Set 
 
The generalization will be presented for a (2 + 1) spacetime on the basis that results 
for higher spacetimes will fall into a pattern. In this case, the reference coordinate 
system is denoted Σr(tr , xr , yr) and a moving world line has the parametric form      
(T, fx(T), fy(T)). The moving observer(cid:146)s instantaneous velocity at (T, fx(T), fy(T)) has 
the components vx = dfx/dT, vy = dfy/dT. The plane of simultaneity through              
(T, fx(T), fy(T)) can be constructed using the appropriate inhomogeneous 2-D Lorentz 
transform with the given velocity components. Then for a particular event                 
(tr’ , xr’ , yr’) in Σr , the elements of the destination set D(tr’ , xr’ , yr’) are closely

associated with those moving world line events simultaneous with (tr’ , xr’ , yr’). The 
order of the destination set D, #D, can be established using numerical methods 
outlined in the text, and apart from a small set of pathological moving world lines, #D 
will be finite. 
 
(b) Messenger Entity Distribution 
 
It is useful to re-state the key aspects of messenger entity behavior in the following 
terms: Messenger entities can exist in 4 states, and at each state the velocity is 
characterised by one of the four null unit vectors in the t (cid:150) x diagram (see Figure 4). 
Between the events of messenger entity creation and destruction messenger entities 
are confined to one stacking integer and to one state. The process of messenger entity 
coupling allows the messenger entity distribution to evolve in non-trivial manner. 
 
In (2 + 1) spacetime, messenger entities can exist (a) in four states where the motion 
is characterised by one of four null unit vectors in the t (cid:150) x diagram, and (b) in a 
further four states where the motion is characterised by the four unit null vectors in 
the t (cid:150) y diagram. In other words, messenger entities can exist in a total of eight states, 
and the generalization follows from this. 
 
 

Appendix 11  
 
Spacetime Structure Parameters 

 
(a) Scope for selection of superposition structure parameters. 
 
Superposition structure parameters may consist of any mapping aij(s) from the 
stacking integer s to a matrix whose elements are vectors-in-a-plane. An extension 
involving a mapping from s to a tensor is possible.  
 
(b) Non-trivial metric effects. 
 
For the scenario of section 9, the evolution equation for the messenger entity 
distribution is 
 
 
 

∂ tn(s0)       = (cid:150)  ∂ xn(s0)    + kn(s0 + 1) (cid:150) pn(s0) 
∂ tn(s0 + 1) =  ∂ xn(s0 + 1) (cid:150) kn(s0 + 1) + pn(s0)  . 
 

(c) Spatially extended quantum moieties 
 
For the scenario of section 10, the evolution equation for the messenger entity 
distribution is 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

∂ tn(s0)       = (cid:150) ∂ xn(s0) (cid:150) kn(s0) + kn(s0 + 3) 
∂ tn(s0 + 1) =    ∂ xn(s0 + 1) (cid:150) kn(s0 + 1) + kn(s0)

Appendix 12  
 

Pathological Moving World Lines in 

rΣ  

rΣ  obeys the relation 

0  + (T (cid:150) T0)2 (cid:150) C2)1/2 , 

 
Suppose that for a continuous interval of the parameter T, the moving world line     
(T, f(T)) in 
 
f(T) = X0 + (X 2
 
with X0 , T0 and C constant and X0 ≠ C.   Then using (3.1) and (3.2) it can be shown 
that each line of simultaneity through the world line (T, f(T)) in the above continuous 
interval contains the event (T0 , X0) in  Σr. In this case the order of the destination set 
D(T0 , X0) is not finite and the analysis of sections 2 and 3 becomes problematic. 
 
One solution is to constrain f(T) in the manner shown in Appendix 2. However it will 
be shown in a future publication that all such pathological moving world lines can be 
incorporated into a quantised spacetime framework provided that each event label has 
the form (t, x, s, m) where t, x and s are familiar and m is a continuous non-negative 
parameter. In fact this newly introduced event label m has precisely the form required 
to permit the description of quantum fields in terms of spacetime structure parameters.

for the monitoring of the position and size of the electron beam of the DAΦNE
BTF, the recently commissioned electron beam-test facility at the Frascati LNF.
A description of the detector construction and assembly, together with the results
achieved during the 2003-2004 runs, are here reported.

1 Introduction

The DAΦNE Beam-test facility (BTF) provides electron/positron beams
with a well-deﬁned number of particles in a wide range of multiplicity and
energy, mainly for detector calibration purposes.
It was commissioned in
2002 and it has delivered beam to user experiments during all years 2003-
2004 [1,2].
A number of detectors have been used for the beam diagnostics during the
commissioning phase and during the users running periods; these detectors
were mainly intended for the measurement of the number of particles in the
beam, in the full operational range of energy, between 25 and 750 MeV, and
multiplicity, from single particle to 1010 particles/bunch.
However, a very important point for the operation of the facility is the mea-
surement of the beam spot position and size, in all the diﬀerent multiplic-
ity and energy conﬁgurations and with non-destructive detectors. High-
ﬂuorescence metallic ﬂags are not sensitive at very low beam intensities
down to the single electron mode, so that position sensitive particle detectors
should be used.
For this purpose, a scintillating-ﬁber detector has been designed, built and
tested during the years 2003-2004 BTF running period. The dector is de-
scribed in Sec. 2 together with some details on the construction and on the
readout and acquisition system, while some experimental results with the
BTF electron/positron beam are reported in Sec. 3.

2 Detector design and construction

2.1 Design considerations

Taking into account cladded scintillating ﬁbers, such as Pol.Hi.Tech type
0046, a light yield of 3-4 photoelectrons/mm (pe) at 0.5 m photocathode
distance has been measured in the past [3]. The light yield depends on the
quantum eﬃciency of the photomultiplier and on the quality of the optical
coupling with the ﬁbers. In order to have a few pe per incident particle even
without optimal coupling to the photocathode (e.g. without employing opti-
cal grease), a few layers of ﬁbers have to be stacked one over the other. This
should give a suﬃcient light yield already with only one electron crossing the
detector. Moreover, by properly staggering the layers, a multi-layer detector
allows to minimize dead spaces between the ﬁbers.

2

Considering a 4 layers detector of 1 mm ﬁbers, a light yield of 1-2 pe/particle
at the photocathode can be conservatively estimated. For a typical photo-
multiplier gain in the range 106-107 a charge signal of 0.1-1 pC/particle can
then be estimated; this should allow both to be sensitive to single electrons,
and to reach the 100-1000 particles/bunch range without saturation, for a
typical 12-bit, 0.25 pC/count, charge integrating ADC.
For a given size of the detector, the number and the area of photocathodes
determines the the number of readout channels and the number of ﬁbers
to be bundled together. Since the typical BTF beam spot has a Gaussian
distribution with σx ≃ σy ≃ 5 mm, a two-view detector should have a size
of at least 5 × 5 cm2, and a millimetric spatial resolution.
A detector consisting of two planes of four layers of 48 ﬁbers of 1 mm diameter
with a readout pitch of 3 mm, will need only 32 channels, and should still
be capable of a millimetric spatial resolution. A total depth of 8 mm of
scintillating ﬁbers corresponds to ≈ 0.02X0, thus giving an almost negligible
eﬀect on the beam energy and spot.

2.2 Scintillating ﬁbers

A two view detector has been constructed, consisting of two identical modules
to be mounted with the ﬁbers running at 90◦. A single module consists of
four layers of 1 mm diameter cladded scintillating ﬁbers, Pol.Hi.Tech type
0046. The 1 m long ﬁbers have been cut in two ∼ 50 cm pieces, then four
stacked layers of 48 ﬁbers glued side-by-side have been assembled, staggered
by 0.5 mm, as shown in the scheme of Fig. 1.

veloped for optical joints with plastic scintillators. A photograph of the ﬁrst
layer of 48 scintillating ﬁbers glued together is shown in Fig. 2; the typical
hardening time for each glued layer was 48 hours.

In Fig. 3 a photograph of the four layers of scintillating ﬁbers are shown
after the gluing, and before wrapping them in a thin foil of aluminum. In
the same photograph the photomultiplier used for the readout is also shown
(see in the following).

2.3 Multi-anode photomultiplier

We have chosen the Hamamatsu H6568 multi-anode photomultiplier (MAPMT)
metal package, based on the R5900-00-M16 tube with a photocathode seg-
mented in 16 pixel of 4.2×4.2 mm2 each; the package also includes the voltage
divider circuit. This MAPMT has a good gain uniformity, low crosstalk with
neightboring channels (below 1%) and good timing performances (1 ns rise
time, 0.3 ns FWHM transit time spread).
We usually set the high voltage to -750 V, corresponding to a gain of ≈ 2×106.

1We have mixed 100 parts by weight of resin and 28 parts by weight of hardener.

Figure 3: The four layers of scintillating ﬁbers after the gluing (on the right),
showed together with the multi-anode PMT (on the left).

A group of three ﬁbers for each of the four layers have been bundled together
to cover the area of a MAPMT pixel (such a group of 12 ﬁbers is represented
by the shaded circles in the schematic view of Fig. 1).

2.4 Detector assembly

For each of the two detector planes, the 16 bundles, constituted by 12 scin-
tillating ﬁbers, have been inserted in a grooved PVC mask, ﬁtting the di-
mensions of the photomultiplier package (∼30×30 mm2), in order to couple
each bundle to a pixel on the MAPMT surface. Since the area of a single
pixel is of 4.2×4.2 mm2, the PVC mask should have been grooved with ≈4
mm side square holes, in order to ﬁt all the ﬁbers in a bundle. However,
for sake of construction semplicity and mechanical robustness, the mask has
been grooved with 4 mm diameter circular holes, so that only 11 out of 12
ﬁbers per bundle are actually coupled to each MAPMT pixel. This is not a
problem, both from the point of view of the uniformity and of the total yield
of light.
A drawing of the mask is shown in Fig. 4, while in Fig. 5 a photograph of
the PVC mask with the 16 scintillating ﬁbers bundles, inserted and ready to
be coupled to the MAPMT, is shown.

a 4 diameter circle. For sake of construction semplicity, a PVC mask with circular
holes has been realized, so that only 11/12 ﬁbers per bundle are coupled to each
MAPMT pixel.

The two planes of the detector have been then wrapped in aluminum foils,
as shown in Fig. 6, and ﬁnally they have been mounted at 90◦, by means of
a mechanical support as shown in Fig. 7.

2.5 Layout on the beam

During the ﬁrst test runs, only one plane of the detector was installed, at
the BTF beam exit (at 45◦) usually dedicated to the user setups, just before
the AIRFLY ﬂuorescence chamber, with the ﬁbers running in the vertical
direction, for measuring the x proﬁle.
In all the following BTF running periods, both the x and y views of the
detector were mounted, on their mechanical support, again, right at the exit
of the BTF beam for the users (Fig. 8).

2.6 Detector readout

The 16 analog signals of the MAPMT pixels are splitted in two by a passive
splitter board. The suitably delayed signals are digitized by a CAEN V792
charge integrating ADC, 0.25 pC/count. The gate signal, 100 ns long, is
generated starting from a reference signal generated by the LINAC timing

circuit for each beam pulse. The analog signals are also digitized by means
of a low threshold discriminator (CAEN V814), with a typical threshold
of 35 mV/50Ω, and the time of each channel is measured by means of a
CAEN V775 VME TDC, 35 ps/count. The VME controller, a VMIC 7740
Pentium III CPU with Tundra VME-PCI chip, runs Red Hat Linux 7.2 and
a LabVIEW 6.1 DAQ program. Further details on the DAQ can be found in
Ref. [1].

3 Experimental results

The beam proﬁle is measured starting from the pulse height measured in
each of the 2×16 MAPMT pixels, by means of the charge integrating ADC
(once having subtracted the pedestal). This pulse height infact should be
proportional to the charge deposited in each ﬁbers bundle.
Since the detector is very thin, ≈ 2% of a radiation length, each electron
transversing it should have a well deﬁned average energy loss, of course with
ﬂuctuations following the typical Landau distribution, so that the average
charge in a pixel should be proportional to the total number of electrons

crossing the corresponding bundle.
In order to check this, the pulse height in the ﬁber detector has been measured
in a run at low electron multiplicity, i.e. in single electron mode. Since the
number of particles in the beam follows the Poisson statistics, the pulse height
in the calorimeter, placed downstream of the ﬁber detector, has been used
to separate events with none, one or two electrons crossing the detector.
In Fig. 9 the pulse height in one view of the detector, summed over all the
ﬁbers, is shown as a function of the pulse height in the calorimeter, for a
run at 493 MeV, with an average multiplicity of 1 particle/pulse. Using the
total energy deposited in the calorimeter, placed ≈ a 1.5 m distance from
the beam exit window, at a distance of 1.1 m from the ﬁber detector, one
can separate one and two electrons events, the pulse height spectrum in the
ﬁbers clearly follows a Landau distribution.
The shape and the position of the beam spot can then be determined by
the charge-weighted distribution of events in the 16 “ﬁngers”, 3 mm wide, of
ﬁbers constituting each of the two views of the detector. Since the BTF is
usually operated at the maximum repetition rate of 49 bunches/s, an accurate
measurement of the beam spot can be achieved already accumulating a few
seconds of beam, even at the lowest particle multiplicity, i.e. in single electron
mode.
A possible problem in building the charge-weighted distribution can be the
non-uniformity of the response of each “ﬁnger”, when crossed by a single
electron. This can be due to a number of reasons; the main one in our

Figure 10: Pulse height of the 16 MAPMT channels (pedestal subtracted); in
order to have an approximately uniform illumination (the detector was arranged
with the ﬁbers running in the horizontal direction, with the beam defocussed in
the vertical plane). This spectrum has been used for the pixel equalization; the
yield differences between the pixels are mainly due to broken/inefﬁcient ﬁbers (as
shown by the groups of pixels with approximately the same yield).

In order to estimate the uniformity of response of the pixels in each view
of the detector, dedicated runs with intermediate multiplicity and a very
defocussed beam have been analyzed. In this data, the beam is constituted
by a few tens of electrons distributed over an area, at the beam exit window,
of ≈ 55×25 mm2, so that the surface of the ﬁber detector is almost uniformely
illuminated. In this condition we could expect an uniform response from all
the 16 channels in one view. In Fig. 10 the pulse height distribution (pedestal
subtracted) of all the channels of one view is shown. There are evident yield
diﬀerences between the pixels; since there are anyhow groups of pixel with
approximately the same response, the diﬀerences can mainly be interpreted
as due to broken or ineﬃcient ﬁbers in the single bundles.
The normalized output in the defocussed beam conditions are used to correct
the relative yield of each pixel, for both views of the detector.
In order to check the functionality of the ﬁrst of the two detector planes,
some runs were taken moving the beam along the horizontal axis (with the
detector arranged with the ﬁbers running along the vertical axis), using a

12

standard focussed beam setting of the BTF, yielding 493 MeV electrons, on
average 1 electron per pulse, with a spot size of few mm. The horizontal
position of the beam has been changed by changing the current of the last
bending magnet in small steps (2 A on a nominal setting of 335A), thus
resulting in a nominal deviation of ≈7 mm at the beam exit window. The
results of this scan in the horizontal direction are shown in Fig. 11.

The shape of the charge-weighted proﬁle is well reproduced by a Gaussian.
By ﬁtting the distribution, the mean values well reproduce the expected beam
deviation. Concerning the width of the distribution, diﬀerent contribution
can be identiﬁed:

• the intrinsic beam spot size; this has been measured with much more
accurate detectors (AGILE Silicon Tracker) to be fairly Gaussian with

σ ≃ 2.2 mm in both dimensions (with the optimized focussed beam
setting we were using, of 493 MeV single electron beam); this includes
the natural width of the beam plus the multiple scattering contribution
on the thin aluminum exit window;

• the resolution of the ﬁber detector;

• if the detector is placed at some distance from the exit window, the

contribution of the multiple scattering in air.

Since the multiple scattering is momentum-dependant, this contribution can
be disentangled by performing the beam spot measurement at diﬀerent beam
energies; of course this is possible only if the beam spot size is not signiﬁ-
cantly changed by changing the BTF line settings for the diﬀerent momentum
settings.
The measured beam proﬁles, only for the horizontal view of the ﬁber de-
tector, in a wide range of electron energy, with an optimal focussing of the
beam and with horizontal collimators almost completely closed (thus with
an approximately unchanged intrinsic horizontal beam size), are shown in
Fig. 12.
The σ values for the Gaussian ﬁts of the proﬁles of Fig. 12 are shown in Fig. 13
as a function of the beam energy. The expected 1/(βcp) dependance for the
multiple scattering contribution can be observed at low energies, while the
measured beam spot approches a constant value at energies above 400 MeV,
of ≈ 3 mm. Two main eﬀects contribute to the plateau value: the spatial
resolution of the ﬁber detector and the widening of the beam spot due to
the intrinsic divergence, that is not negligible even if the beam is strongly
collimated in the BTF line.
Another important point is the possibility of using the ﬁber detector also at
intermediate beam intensities, i.e. between tens and thousands of particles
per pulse, without any signiﬁcant performance loss. In order to check this,
the beam spot has been monitored for a focussed beam while increasing the
beam intensity. No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the measured beam spot can be
found up to several hundreds particles per bunch, as shown in the example
in Fig. 14, where the horizontal proﬁle is shown for a single particle beam,
for ≈ 150, up to more than 600 particles/pulse.

Figure 13: Horizontal beam spot size as a function of the beam energy: the be-
haviour is consistent with the 1/(βcp) dependance of the multiple scattering RMS
angle at low energy, while approaches a constant value at higher energies, given by
the contributions of the beam divergence and the ﬁber detector spatial resolution.

4 Conclusions

The scintillating ﬁber detector has been built in order to have a simple,
robust, easy to build and to manage beam spot monitor, capable of a mil-
limetric resolution in a wide range of the BTF beam operating parameters
(energy, intensity, focussing). The granularity of the readout has been sacri-
ﬁed to the possibility of having as little as 32 ADC channels, so that they are
all housed in a single 6U VME board, with only two 16-channels multianode
photomultipliers, and to the possibility of having a good light yield even with
only one electron crossing the ﬁbers, with a relatively thin detector (only four
layers per view).
However, the detector performed very well during the 2003 data taking, and
allowed to continuously monitor the position and the size of the beam, with
an accuracy of ≈ 2 mm, in both views.
Since a few seconds of data taking, at the maximum repetition rate of 49
pulses/s, are suﬃcient to get a satifactory beam proﬁle, the horizontal and
vertical charge-weighted histogram have been integrated in the DAΦNE BTF
contol system. The shape of the beam in both x and y views can then
be viewed online in the main panel of the BTF control system, as shown
in Fig. 15. This demonstrated to be very useful tool, both in the beam
optimization phases, and for driving the beam onto the users experimental
apparata with a good accuracy.
Most importantly, the detector is eﬀective in a wide range of beam intensities,
being eﬃcient in single particle mode, and in the 103 particles/pulse range
without any signiﬁcant loss of resolution.

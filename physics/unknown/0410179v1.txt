Abstract 

Kinetic effects with regard to a one dimensional Langmuir soliton-like pulse are investigated. 

Though  thus  far  mainly  transit-time  accelerations  have  been  investigated  regarding  strong 

Langmuir  turbulence,  it  is  found  that  ponderomotive  reflections  (generalized  nonlinear 

Landau damping) may play important roles also. The former may diffuse fast electrons up to 

relativistic  energies,  while  the  latter reflects  slow  electrons as  well as  ions  that  have  speeds 

comparable  with  the  group  velocity  of  the  pulse,  and  tend  to  form  flat-top  electron 

distributions at and around the quasi-soliton.

1. Introduction 

Accelerations of charged particles by Langmuir solitons have been studied extensively1 as 

the  foremost  dissipation  mechanisms  in  strong  Langmuir  turbulence.  Here,  particle 

accelerations  by  a  one-dimensional  Langmuir  soliton-like  pulse  are  investigated  in  detail. 

When  relatively  long,  Langmuir  waves  have  large  enough  amplitudes,  they  are  subject  to 
modulational  instabilities1; the  modulational instabilities are  saturated  by  forming  Langmuir 

solitons  that  are  supposedly  stable,  say,  in  a  sufficiently  intense  magnetic  field.  Such  a  1D 

Langmuir  soliton  field  E(z,  t)  as  well  as  the  corresponding  density  perturbation  N(z,  t)  are 
given as functions of the space z and time t in a normalized form respectively as follows1,2:

notations are standard. It can be proved that 1D Langmuir solitons are stable in the absence of 
dissipation, 1  which  is  not  included  in  Eqs.(1)  and  (2).  However,  the  dissipation  of  a  pulse 

cannot actually be ignored if there exit efficient mechanisms for particle accelerations, which 
are  the  subject  of  the  present  study.  In  fact,  C.H.  Ling  et  al.  2  have  performed  1D  Vlasov 

simulations of various Langmuir solitons, and showed that a high-energy tail is formed on the 

electron  distribution  function  as  well  as  that  initially  propagating  Langmuir  soliton  may  be 

decelerated rather efficiently unless Te>>Ti. The former is well known, and may be explained 
via  transit-time  acceleration1  [TTA],  but  the latter,  which the  authors  attributed  to  nonlinear 

Landau  damping,  requires  a  more  explicit  explanation.  The  result  of  the  simulation  by 
C.H.Ling et al. 2 is rather surprising because 1D Langmuir solitons have been believed stable. 

In  the  present  study,  however,  to  keep  coherence  with  the  previous  studies  of  particle 

accelerations by a Gaussian pulse, a Gaussian soliton-like pulse is adopted as below.

previously, and their theoretical estimates are readily available. 3 

To investigate particle acceleration analytically or numerically the one-dimensional relativistic 

equation  of  motion  is  used.  It  was  previously  found  that  a  pulse  of  the  form  (3)  may 

accelerate/decelerate charged particles through two mechanisms, i.e., TTA and ponderomotive 

reflections[PR]. 3 TTA, after penetrating a pulse, yields following velocity shifts:

The maximum velocity shift may be calculated easily from (4). As the transit-time

longer the velocity shift decreases. For high velocity particles the transit-time 

t

  is reduced, 

and the velocity shift becomes proportional to 

t

  or inversely proportional to v0. Only in the 

limit of    v0 = c the maximum velocity shifts by TTA equals zero. Namely, if sufficient wave 

energy and interaction time are available, TTA may accelerate particles to relativistic energies.   

On the other hand, PR is effective for particles resonant with vg , i.e., vg + vref > v0 > vg

2. Results 

2.1 Transit-time acceleration and nonlinear Landau damping 

In  this  section,  the  equation  of  motion  will  be  solved  numerically,  and  the  resultant 

velocity  shifts  will  be  compared  with  theoretical  results.  As  one  of  the  our  objects  is  to 

elaborate on the simulation results of C.H. Ling et al., 2 we will set physical parameters as their 

simulations,  i.e.,  the  ion-to-electron  mass  ratio  is  100,  c/  ve=100,  and  K0=3/15.  The  last  one

minimum (squares) velocity shifts after the interaction with a Langmuir soliton-like pulse (3) 

are plotted. The initially low velocity electrons are reflected by PRs, while high velocity ones 

are subject to TTA. TTA is not so effective for heating ambient electrons.

numerical results are in excellent agreement with analytical ones (4). In Fig.1 and Eq.(4), the 

possibility  is  shown  that  if  sufficiently  long  interaction  time  is  allowed,  TTA  may  drive 

electrons to relativistic energies. Thus, it is quite understandable that in the simulations of C.H. 
Ling et al. 2 among others1 tails were formed on background electron distribution functions. 

TTA  may  decelerate  some  fast  electrons  to  lower  velocities.  Hence,  as  is  well  known,  TTA 
diffuses electrons in velocity space. Meanwhile, slow electrons with v0 £ 0.6 ve are subject to 
PR,  through  which  electrons  resonant  with  the  soliton,  i.e.,  v0 » vg  =0  are  reflected.  The 
numerical results are in excellent agreement with the theory. Though in the velocity space the 

active region of TTA is much broader than that of PR, the number of particles subject to PR 

exceeds that to TTA. Hence, PR could become more important than TTA.   

2.2 Effects on distribution functions

found that at 

t = 100 a tail is formed on the high-energy side of the beam and the fastest 

electrons  gained  the  velocities  slightly  less  than  11ve,  while  the  low-energy  side  remains 
essentially  Maxwellian.  This  trend  becomes  more  conspicuous  at 
t  =  200.  These  results

can be explained by TTA expressed in Fig.1. Beam density also is depleted somewhat at the 

position  of  the  soliton.(not  shown)  Finally,  let  us  point  out  that  in  the  presence  of  solitons 

beam particles tend to be accelerated to form an exponential energetic tail. This is owing to 

the fact that the beam-plasma instabilities generate waves, the phase velocities of which are 

close to the beam velocity. This indicates that the beam generated turbulence is first dissipated 

by beam particles rather than the ambient particles as usually thought. 

3. Conclusions     

Present  analyses  of  particle  acceleration  mechanisms  with  regard  to  Langmuir 

solitons reveal that for electrons PR (nonlinear Landau damping) also may become important. 

It  is  found  that  PR  is  responsible  for  the  formation  of  non-Maxwellian  electron  distribution 

functions  with  reduced  low-energy  electrons  at  and  around  Langmuir  solitons.  Finally,  in 

strong  Langmuir  turbulence  beam  particles  may  be  accelerated,  and  form  an  exponential 

energetic tail. It may become the most significant dissipation source.

Abstract 

The progress of a multiple bunches of electrons through several thousand accelerator structures results in a wakefield 
which if left unchecked will kick successive bunches off the axis of the accelerator and can at the very least dilute the 
final luminosity of the final colliding beams, or at worst can lead to a BBU (Beam Break Up) instability.  In order to 
damp the wakefields to acceptable levels for travelling wave structures we detune the frequencies of the cells and we 
couple out the field to four adjacent manifolds.   Optimizing the manifold-cell coupling for several hundred cells and 
changing the bandwidth parameters of the distribution has in previous structures been achieved by a process of trial and 
error.  Here, we report on an optimized Fortran code that has been specifically written with the aim minimizing the sum 
of the squares of the RMS and standard deviation of the sum wakefield.    Sparse matrix techniques are employed to 
reduce the computational time required for each frequency step.   The wakefield is minimized whilst ensuring that no 
significant local surface heating occurs due to slots cuts into the accelerator cells to couple out the wakefield.

Abstract 

 

The progress of a multiple bunches of electrons through 
several 
in  a 
thousand  accelerator  structures  results 
wakefield  which  if  left  unchecked  will  kick  successive 
bunches off the axis of the accelerator and can at the very 
least  dilute  the  final  luminosity  of  the  final  colliding 
beams,  or  at worst can lead to a BBU (Beam Break Up) 
instability.  In order to damp the wakefields to acceptable 
levels  for  travelling  wave  structures  we  detune  the 
frequencies of the cells and we couple out the field to four 
adjacent  manifolds. 
  Optimizing  the  manifold-cell 
coupling  for  several  hundred  cells  and  changing  the 
bandwidth  parameters  of  the  distribution  has  in  previous 
structures  been  achieved  by  a  process  of  trial  and  error.  
Here,  we  report  on  an  optimized  Fortran  code  that  has 
been specifically written with the aim minimizing the sum 
of  the  squares  of  the  RMS  and  standard  deviation  of the 
sum wakefield.    Sparse matrix techniques are employed 
to  reduce  the  computational  time  required  for  each 
frequency  step.      The  wakefield  is  minimized  whilst 
ensuring  that  no  significant  local  surface  heating  occurs 
due to slots cuts into the accelerator cells to couple out the 
wakefield. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
The  main  X-band  linacs  in  the  NLC  have  been 
redesigned  from  1.8  meters  structures  operating  in  the 
2π/3  accelerating  mode  to  60cm  structures  operating  in 
the 5π/6 accelerating mode.  A new structure was required 
as  electrical  breakdown  was  found  to  occur  in  RDDS1 
[1].    The  shorter  high  phase  advance  structure  under 
consideration  in  this  paper  is  known  as  HDDS  (High 
Phase  Advance  Damped  Detuned  Structure)  and  it 
consists of 55 cells in which the average group velocity is 
2% of the velocity of light.  This structure incorporates a 
Sech distribution of frequencies and manifold damping is 
achieved  by  a  series  of  slots  cut  into  the  accelerator  to 
couple  out 
the  wakefield.  Recent  experiments  are 
encouraging as higher gradients with reduced breakdown 
rates and minimal damage have been obtained with short 
low group velocity structures. [2].   

In  all  previous  designs  the  electromagnetic  field  is 
enhanced in the direct vicinity of the slots and this gives 
rise  to  an  increased  pulse  temperature  rise.    In  order  to 
reduce  the  temperature  rise  the  coupling  slots  have  been 
redesigned  so  that  they  are  now  “pie”  shaped  (as  they 
taper in towards the cell).  This results in a more uniform 
distribution of fields along the slots.  The temperature rise 
is calculated to be 25° C (reduced from ~70° C).

The  new  dipole  wakefield  is  calculated  using  the 
method outlined in [3] for the first band for three separate 
cases: a single structure in which all 55 cells are coupled 
to the manifold, a structure in which 2 cells are decoupled 
from  either  end  of  the  accelerator  and,  a  series  of  3 
structures  with  3-fold  interleaving  of  cell  frequencies 
(each of which has two cells decoupled).  In all cases the 
wakefield is optimized and it is described in the following 
section.    The  beam  dynamics  resulting  from  the  three 
separate cases are discussed in the final section. 

2. WAKEFIELD OPTIMIZATION 
The group velocity of the fundamental mode imposes a 
restriction  on  the  bandwidth  of  the  dipole  mode.    In  the 
present  design  the  bandwidth is limited to approximately 
10%  or  less  of  the  central  frequency.  The  new  structure 
has  55  cells  compared  to  206 in the original RDDS1 [4] 
and  as  there  are  less  modes  in  a  similar  bandwidth  then 
the modes do not overlap as effectively.  Thus, to achieve 
similar  wakefields  as  RDDS1  requires  larger  damping 
than was previously used and this necessitates larger cell-
to-manifold  coupling  and  a  careful  optimization  of  the 
frequency distribution. 

In  the  design  of  all  structures  we  minimize  the

(2.1) 
Here, the first term W1 is the wakefield at the first trailing 
bunch  due  to  the  first  accelerated  bunch  and  from  a 
“daisy-chain” model [5] it is found to be a major indicator 
as  to  whether  BBU  occurs.  The  remaining  terms  are 
dependent  on  the  sum  wakefield,  which  at  a  particular 
bunch  location,  is  the  sum  of  the  wakefield  of  all 
preceding  bunches.    The  RMS  of  the  sum  wakefield, 
SRMS, has been found to be an indicator as to whether or 
not BBU will occur and in practice it has been found that 
provided its value is less than unity then BBU is unlikely 
to  occur.    The  final  quantity  is  Sσ the standard deviation 
of the sum wakefield and this is an indicator of alignment 
tolerances [6]. 
  In  order  to  minimize  ∆,  the  bandwidth  and  σ  of  the 
frequency  distribution  of  cells  are  varied.    We  chose  an 
initial  distribution  of  the  form  (Sech(f/σ))1.5  and  this 
distribution has similar properties to a Gaussian but with a 
slightly 
this 
optimization process are shown in Figs. 1, in which three 
simulations are illustrated.  Provided all cells are coupled 
to the manifold then a well-damped wakefield is obtained.

Figure  1.    Spectral  function  for  HDDS  under  three 
different  conditions.    Shown  uppermost  is  a  single 
structure  in  which  the  cost  function  has  been  minimized 
when  all  the  cells  are  coupled  to  the  manifold.  The 
bandwidth  is    7.46%  and  the  total  frequency  width  is 
3.38σ.  Decoupling 2 cells from the manifold at either end 
of the structure is shown in the middle figure and it clearly 
degrades  the  spectral  function  significantly.    The  re-
optimised bandwidth is 7.29% and 3.30 units of σ.    The 
optimized  spectral  function with 2 cells decoupled and 3 
fold  interleaving  is  shown  lowermost  for  an  initial 
bandwidth 7.67% and 3.48σ

Figure  2.    Envelope  of  wake  function  for  the  conditions 
given  in  the  adjacent  figure.      The  points  indicate  the 
location of the bunches.  Each bunch is separated from its 
neighbour  by  42cm  and  there  are  192  of  them  in  each 
bunch  train.    The  wake  incorporating  3-fold  interleaving 
of  structures  is  below  1V/pC/mm/m  for  all  bunches.  
Beam dynamics simulations have indicated that provided 
the total (including higher bands) wake is lower than unity 
then BBU will be prevented.    The three-fold interleaved 
case, shown lowermost required a 50% reduction in cell-
to-manifold  coupling  compared  to  the  non-interleaved 
case.  This allows for some flexibility in the design of the 
coupling slots. 

in  order 

 
The  impact  on  the  wakefield  of  decoupling  two  cells  on 
either cells of the structure is shown in the centre of Fig. 2 
and  it is seen to degrade the wakefield significantly.   In 
earlier structures we were required to decouple cells from 
the  manifold 
to  facilitate  attachment  of 
fundamental  and  higher  order  mode  couplers.    For 
HDDS1 a redesigned fundamental mode coupler [7], with 
reduced  fields  will  be  used,  and  it  may  be  possible  to 
couple all 55 cells.  However, if 2 or more cells are forced 
to be decoupled then three-fold interleaving of structures 
will  be  required  and  the  wakefield  for  this  situation  is 
shown lowermost in Fig. 2.   

3. BEAM DYNAMICS 
An indication  as  to  whether  BBU occurs is provided by  
SRMS  and  this  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  3  as  a  function  of  a 
small fractional error in the bunch spacing (equivalent to a 
systematic  error  in  the  frequencies  of  all  cells).    In  all 
three designs the minimum value of SRMS is seen to lie at 
design  value  of  the  bunch  spacing.  The  single  partially     
coupled structure is very sensitive to systematic errors as

Figure 3 SRMS as a function of the fractional change in the 
bunch  spacing  for  three  cases.    The  red  solid  line  (A)  is 
obtained for all cells coupled to the damping manifold of 
the  structure,  black  short dashes (B) to a single structure 
in  which  two  cells  are  decoupled  from  the  manifold  at 
either end of the structure, long blue dashed (C) to 2 cells 
decoupled and three-fold interleaving of structures. 
 
SRMS  rises  to  unity  and  above  with  frequency  errors  as 
little as 3 MHz.  Both the fully-coupled and the partially 
coupled  with  three-fold  interleaving  of  structures  can 
tolerate frequency errors in excess of 15 MHz before the 
BBU instability is likely to occur.     

Further  evidence  as  to  whether  BBU  is  occurring  is 
provided  by  tracking  the  normalized  emittance  with 
respect  to  the  centroid  of  the  beam  down  the  complete 
linac.    The  result  of  tracking  the  progress  of  a  beam 
initially offset by 1µm using the computer code LIAR [8] 
is  shown  in  Fig.  4.    It  is  clear  that  both  the  single  fully 
coupled and three-fold   interleaved   structure gives    rise    

 

to     little emittance growth.  Indeed, the final emittance 
dilution  results  almost  entirely  from  the  short  range 
transverse  wakefield  which

In  order  to  assess  the  worst  case  scenario  systematic 
errors  were  assigned  according  to  the  nearest  peaks  in  
SRMS.  The frequency errors assigned in cases A, B and C 
are  39,  11.4  and  30.7  MHz  respectively.    Even  though 
these  large errors are unlikely to occur in practice, Fig 5

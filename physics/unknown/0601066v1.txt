This  article  proves  that  elementary  particles  can  violate  the  second  postulate  of  the 
Special Relativity. Since, according to Heisenberg’s principle superluminal particles are 
allowed in the theoretical framework of Quantum Mechanics. In this paper the tachyons, 
are identified with the past time-like cone of the unitary irreducible representations of the 
“full” Poincare group (Poincare group plus space-time reflections.) 
  
 

Introduction 
 
Einstein’s  theory  of  relativity  demands  that  exist  a  symmetry  that  leaves  invariant  the 
laws of  physics [1], under the relative motion  of reference frames. Einstein also claims 
that the time coordinate rests on the same footing than the space coordinates. Therefore 
the Poincare group must be enlarged to include space-time inversions. Ne’eman et al [2] 
have  conjectured  that  a  theory  of  quantum  gravity  could  be  the  result  of  enhancing  the 
Poincare group to SA(r,4). Schwinger already intended to introduce the strong reflections 
in quantum field theory [3]. Section 1 is devoted to explaining the tunneling of a particle 
from the future time-like region to the past time-like region of the space-time. In sections 
2 to 6 the unitary irreducible representations of the “full” Poincare group are constructed. 
 

1. The Interpretation of Tachyons as Antiparticles 
 
In  the  one  particle  scheme  Feynman  and  Stückelberg  interpret  antiparticles  as  particles 
moving backwards in time [4]. This argument is reinforced by G. Sudarshan [5] and S. 
Weinberg [6] who realized that antiparticles existence is a consequence of the violation 
of  the  principle  of  causality  in  quantum  mechanics.    The  temporal  order  of  the  events 
could be inverted when a particle wanders in the neighborhood of the light cone.  How is 
the antimatter generated from matter?   According to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle a 
particle  wandering  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  light-cone  suddenly  tunnels  (acquire  a 
speed greater than the speed of light) from the time-like region to the space-like region; 
2x is 
in  this  region  the  relation  of  cause  and  effect  collapses.    Since  if  an  event,  at

observer B moving with a velocity v respect to observer A, will see the events separated

events is exchanged for the observer B, that is, 
2x  as observed by 
than the event at

A, it is observed by B as if it were absorbed at
The  temporal  order  of  the  particle  is  inverted.  This  event  is  completely  feasible  in  the 
neighborhood  of  the  light-cone,  since  the  uncertainty  principle  allows  a  particle  tunnel 
from time-like to space-like cone regions.  That is the uncertainty principle will consent 
to the space-like region reach values above than zero as is shown by equation:

 is the Compton wave-length of the particle.   The left hand side of the equation 

1

t

(22)    can  be  positive  or  space-like  for  distances  less  or  equal  than  the  square  of  the 
Compton wavelength of the particle.  Therefore, causality is violated.  The only way of 
2x ,  before  it  is 
interpreting  this  phenomenon  is  assuming  that  the  particle  absorbed  at
1x  as it is observed by B, is actually a particle with negative mass and energy, 
emitted at 
t <  [6]. This event is 
and certain charge, and spin, moving backward in time; that is 
2
equivalent to see an antiparticle moving forward in time with positive mass and energy, 
and  opposite  charge  and  spin  that  it  is  emitted  at 
2x .  With  this 
reinterpretation  the  causality  is  recovered.    But,  this  interpretation  is  still  incomplete, 
since these particles do not have a real existence. Imaginary masses, length contraction, 
and time dilations populate the theory of tachyons [5]. This paper interprets the tachyons 
as  particles  that  tunnel  from  the  future  time-like  to  the  past  time-like  regions.  So, 
superluminal  particles  are  nothing  else,  but  certainly  antiparticles.  Heisenberg’s 
uncertainly principle limits their existence to very short life-time. 
The square of the mass for the observers A and B is a Poincare invariant.  In other words, 
the  mass  of  a  particle  itself  is  not  an  invariant  [7],  but  its  square 2
.    There  is 
p
nothing to prevent that the rest mass could have different sign in another reference frame, 
as  happen  with  its  energy,  electric  charge  and  spin.    In  recent  publication  [8],  it  is 
conjectured that a  particle  moving  backward  in time  possesses  a  negative  mass.    When 

1x and  it  is  absorbed  at

m= −

this  particle  is  observed  as  an  antiparticle  moving  forward  in  time  its  mass  is  positive. 
Still its mass square is a Poincare invariant.

Figure  1.  A  particle  moving  backwards  in  time  is  equivalent  to  an  antiparticle  moving 
forward in time with opposite spin (not showed), charge, and mass.  
 
Under  the  light  of  the  uncertainty  principle  the  arguments  against  the  negative  energy 
states are untenable. Since a particle must reach a speed greater than that of the light to 
reverse  the  time  direction  and  acquire  a  negative  mass.  Classically  this  event  is 
impossible,  but  in  quantum  mechanics  it  is  totally  feasible.    Therefore,  the  potential 
barrier that has to overcome a particle to be seen as an antiparticle is closely related with 
the impossibility to reach the speed of light. Let us picture this phenomenon with Klein’s 
example. Assume a potential of the form

Klein’s argument is useful to visualize the violation of causality on the neighborhood of 
the light-cone, and to understand the creation of antiparticles when those particles move 
space-time  distances  on  the  order  of  their  Compton  wavelength  near  to  the  light-cone 
boundaries  [9].  According  to  Klein’s  paradox  the  index  of  reflected  particles  is  greater 
than one. The paradox disappears if one takes into account the creation of particles and 
antiparticles.    The  particles  move  in  the  direction  of  reflection  and  the  antiparticles  are 
attracted  in  opposite  direction  by  the  potential  V.  According  to  equation  (2),  tunneling 
can occur from region I to III.

hence  an  imaginary  momentum.    During  this  time,  the  particle  is  “off-mass-shell,”  the 
particle  exists  as  a  virtual  particle  and  it  is  responsible  for  force  transmissions.    When 
finally the particle reaches Region III, passes from a virtual to a real existence, with its 
mass and energy negatives [9] [10].  To pass from Region I to Region II or III is not a 
“downhill”  transition,  since  the  particle  has  to  reach  a  speed  greater  than  the  speed  of 
light,  when  moves  from  Region  I  to  Region  II,  that  is,  it  has  to  undergo  an  infinite

Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle makes this event feasible. 
  
In this paper the irreducible representations of the Poincare group are reviewed to include 
simultaneous  time-space  reflections.  The  irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare 
group with simultaneous reflection of time and space will be constructed.   
 
It  is  also  conjectured  in  this  paper  that  all  the  regions  formed  by  the  light  cone  have  a 
physical meaning and that these regions describe the elementary particles.  Lamb’s shift 
is an example of the physical existence of one of those regions [11]. 
 
The possible existence of dark matter could be a consequence of the negative mass value 
of  the  four-dimensional  mirror  particles  reflection.  Massless  particles  have  an  infinite 
Compton  wavelength,  therefore  their  particles  and  antiparticles  appear  in  the  same 
proportion. Photons and antiphotons would appear in the same amount. Neutrinos would 
appear  in  nature  in  asymmetric  proportion,  since  these  are  not  massless  particles.  At 
distances  compared  to  the  Compton  wavelength  of  system  of  particles  the  value  of  the 
entropy of a close system could decrease due to the arrow of time that can be reversed.  
 

2. Unitary Irreducible Representations of Poincare Group with Simultaneous Space-
Time Reflections 
 
The  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  extended  group  of  Poincare  have  been 
constructed  by  constraining  from  the  onset  the  energy  values  to  be  positive  as  a 
consequence  of  this  assumption  time  reversal  operator  is  antilinear.  Later  the  antilinear 
property  of  the  time  reversal  operator  is  utilized  to  prevent  the  existence  of  negative 
energy  states  for  elementary  particles  [12].  In  this  paper,  however  the  opposite 
approximation is proposed. The quantum negative energy states are accepted on the basis 
that the creation of an antiparticle (particle of negative energy) is briefly allowed by an 
interval  of  time  ruled  by  the  uncertainty  principle;  while  the  particle  moves  around  the 
light  cone  boundaries  that  separate  time-like  from  space-like  regions.  On  the 
neighborhood  of  this  boundary  the  probability  of  tunneling  is  greater  than  zero.  A 
collapse  of  particles  toward  negative  energy  states  is  classically  prohibited  by  the 
impossibility  that  a  particle  can  exceed  the  speed  of  light.  However,  in  quantum 
mechanics is briefly permitted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle [see eqn. (2)]; as it 
is discussed above. If this phenomenon occurred continuously, the propagation speed of 
the information between two objects would be infinite. Furthermore, tunneling has a low 
probability  of  occurrence,  and  the  mean  lifetime  of  an  antiparticle  is  in  general  short, 
since this is immediately absorbed by its particle to transform into gamma rays. 
 
The  classical  way  to  construct  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare 
group is by using the technique of the little group. Let us consider the orbits or regions 
where the magnitude of the four vector ŝ2 = x2+y2+z2-c2t2 is: zero, with all its components 
equal to zero; zero with its components different of zero; greater than zero, and less than 
zero. To obtain these unitary irreducible representations we will use the two dimensions

another observer on an inertial frame could see the same particle with negative rest mass. 
An  electron  with  negative  rest  mass  and  energy  moving  backwards  in  space  and  time 
could  be  interpreted  as  its  antiparticle  moving  forward  in  space  and  time  with  positive 
rest mass and energy. This phenomenon could by explained by constructing the unitary 
irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare  group  with  simultaneous  space-time 
inversions. 
To construct the unitary irreducible representations of the full Poincare group one applies

namely the  spin s, and the  parity η.  If one applies space inversions to the  basis vector

 of the unitary irreducible representation of SU(2). This 

fact  explains  why  it  is  necessary  to  conjugate  and  transpose  the  wave  equation  of  a 
particle to describe its antiparticle. Thus, time reflection induces negative energy states 
and  these  states  induce  charge  conjugation.  If  a  mirror  reflection  is  a  symmetry 
transformation,  then  this  reflection  must  be  accompanied  by  simultaneous  space-time 
inversions, since the intrinsic parity label is generated by space reflection.  
Due  to  the  fact  that  one  has  to  conjugate  and  transpose,  time  reversal  acquires  the 
properties of an antilinear operator. And since the character of the representations of the

The momentum is reversed and the particle acquires a definite parity. In order to generate

Therefore,  in  this  formulation  the  simultaneous  action  of  space-time  inversions  on  a 
general basis vector (particle) of the representation reverses the energy, momentum, and 
spin  (antiparticle).  The  space  inversion  furnishes  a  definite  parity,  η,  to  the  elementary 
particle  described  by  the  unitary  irreducible  representation.  The  elementary  particle 
violates the causality principle because it is represented in the negative energy sector of 
the light cone. If it has enough energy it can be observed as a particle moving backwards 
in  space  and  time  (antiparticle).  Therefore,  the  C,  T,  P,  CT,  CP,  PT  cannot  conserve 
separately,  but  CPT.  In  my  opinion  not  all  the  symmetries  that  would  enhance  the  full 
Poincare  group  are  known.  Then,  it  is  quite  possible  that  exists  a  violation  of  CPT  for 
large  symmetries.  The  full  group  of 
physical  phenomena 
diffeomorphisms (space-time reflections included) is a larger symmetry than that of the 
full  Poincare  group;  therefore  CPT  could  be  violated  by  quantum  gravity.  By  the  same 
token supersymmetry, supergravity, and superstrings could violate CPT.

Hence, T2 = 1 for integer spin, and T2 =-1for particles of half integer spin.  
 
4. Particles of Zero Mass 
 
For  massless  particles,  or  the  future  null  and  past  null  regions  4  and  5,  the  unitary 
irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare  group  are  labeled  by  unitary  irreducible 
representations  of  its  little  group.  The  little  group  of  that  of  Poincare  group  in  these 
regions  is  the  Euclidean  group  E(2)  in  two-dimensions,  one  will  denote  its  elements  by

Therefore,  these  vectors  belong  to  the  P(0,m)+  P(0,-m)  representation,  contrary  to  the 
representation P(k,m) these representations do not carry spin, but helicity. Therefore, time

This equation represents a particle of zero rest mass, and zero helicity, but with a definite 
parity that changes its momentum and energy under space-time reversal. 
 
We  realize  that  transitions  between  time-like  and  space-like  states  for  a  “massless” 
particle are highly probable, since if the four momentum, p2 = 0, is sharply defined, then 
its four vector position

is  completely  uncertain,  since  its  Compton  wavelength  is  undetermined  [14].    The 
massless particle could exist in any place of the light cone. The principle of causality is 
strongly violated. If one observes a given amount of photons with p2 = 0 is because a big 
amount of other photons populate the space-like, and the time-like regions.  The action, 
of these dark photons, on the universe should be measurable. 
 
 
5. Imaginary Mass Particles 
 
In  the  space-like,  region  1,  the  eigenvalue  of  the  square  of  the  four-momentum  is  the 
negative  of  the  square  of  the  rest  mass  of  the  particle.  Therefore,  the  mass  would  be 
imaginary number. No physical interpretation of elementary particles could be associated 
to  this  region;  however,  the  square  of  the  four-momentum  could  have  a  physical 
meaning. It turn out that the square of the four-momentum is not equal to the square of 
the mass for internal lines in a Feynman diagram.  It is conjectured in this article that a 
possible  interpretation  could  be  given  to  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the 
“full” Poincare group. Virtual particles would be good candidates to achieve this goal.

infinite  dimensional.  Therefore,  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare 
group in this region are the same than that of the Lorentz group. They are labeled by the 
eigenvalues of the Casimir of the algebra SU(2)XSU(2), that is, the angular momentum 
on three dimensions u, v.  The group SU(2)XSU(2) is locally isomorphic to the Lorentz 
group,  therefore  their  Lie  algebras  are  equivalents.  There  are  two  classes  of  these 
representations,  the  principal  series  (v  =  -iw,  w  real,  j0  =  0,1/2,1,…)  and  the 
complementary series (-1 ≤ v ≤ 1; j0 = 0).  Because combined space-time transformations 
commute with the generators of the Lorentz group the states of this representation have a 
definite parity. Furthermore, vacuum oscillations make these states to undergo transitions 
to positive and negative energy states as well as imaginary mass (virtual states).  
 
Conclusion 
 
This  paper  proves  that  the  interpretation  of  tachyons  as  antiparticles,  set  on  a  realistic 
basis Sudarshan’s conjecture of the existence of particles that move faster than the speed 
of light, that is, superluminal particles.  
 
Acknowledgments 
 
I  would  like  to  thank  George  Sudarshan  for  discussing  with  me  the  incompatibility  of 
Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics to explain the creation of antiparticles under the 
same theoretical scheme. I am in debted with Yuval Ne’eman for help me to understand

the  importance  of  group  theory  in  physics.  The  last  acknowledgment,  but  not  the  least 
goes to Roger Pecina for his worthy commentaries to the manuscript.

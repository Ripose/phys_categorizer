The progress in human civilization and human living style were undergoing acceleration  in  the
last  hundred  years.  Recalling  the  processes  from  Maxwell’s  theory  of  electromagnetic  field  to  Hertz’s
verification  experiment  to  nowadays  communication  and  medium  systems  and  those  from  the
mathematical  constructivity  of  computer  pioneers  Turing  and  von  Newman  to  nowadays  information
high-way, data-base and data-treatment systems, we realize that the advances  of  science  are  the  primary
one of motive forces for this progress. Scientific researches, as being especially less commercial, deserve
to receive more attentions and supports from human society. In which direction and  how  to  support  and
invest in scientific researches ought to be perpetually an important issue for human society.

The  Creativity  Science  Collaboration  has  singled  out  my  work  “Motivations  to  modify  special
relativity” [1] for the “Creative Scientist of the Year 2003” award winning work. In that work, I reported
several  observations  on  special  relativity,  its  experimental  facts  and  its  relations  to  quantum  mechanics
and  statistical  mechanics.  These  observations  made  us  conscious:  Special  relativity  is  not  a  ultimate
theory; Some modification is needed; Any modification must not violate the principles of the constancy of
the light speed and of the local Lorentz invariance; We probably have to change the assumption on local
structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  special  relativity.  Actually,  such  a  kind  of  modification  of
special  relativity  has  been  already  done.  The  generalized  Finslerian  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and
time in the usual inertial coordinate system have been proposed. Here, in this lecture, I would like to talk
about these structures of gravity-free space and time and their recognized phenomena.

Two  fundamental  postulates  that  Einstein  states  in  his  special  theory  of  relativity  are  (i)  the
principle  of  relativity  and  (ii)  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light  in  all  inertial  frames  of  reference.
Conceptually,  the  principle  of  relativity  implies  that  there  exists  a  class  of  equivalent  inertial  frames  of
reference, any one of which moves with a non-zero constant velocity relative to any other and any one of
which is supplied with motionless, rigid unit rods of equal length and motionless, synchronized clocks of
equal running rate.

Einstein wrote: “in a given inertial frame of reference the coordinates mean the results of certain
measurements  with  rigid  (motionless)  rods,  a  clock  at  rest  relative  to  the  inertial  frame  of  reference
defines a local time, and the local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized clocks and taken
together,  give  the  time  of  this  inertial  frame  of  reference.”  [2]  As  defined  by  Einstein,  in  each  inertial
frame of reference, an observer can employ his motionless-rigid rods and motionless-synchronized clocks
in  the  so-called  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method  to
measure space and time intervals. By using this “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock”
measurement method, the observer in each inertial frame of reference sets up his usual inertial coordinate
system,  denoted  by  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3.  Postulate  (ii)  asserts  that  the  measured  speed  of  light  is  the  same
constant c in every such usual inertial coordinate system.

Besides the two postulates, however, special relativity uses another assumption. This assumption
concerns  the  Euclidean  structure  of  gravity-free  space  and  the  homogeneity  of  gravity-free  time  in  the
usual inertial coordinate system,
rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,
anywhere and at any time.

Postulates (i) and (ii) and the assumption Eqs.(1a-1b) together yield  the  Lorentz  transformation
between any two usual inertial coordinate systems. Though this assumption was not explicitly articulated,
most likely having been considered self-evident, Einstein said in 1907: “Since the propagation velocity of
2=0 and
light in empty space is c with respect to both reference systems, the two equations, x1

2=0 must be equivalent.” [3]. Leaving aside the question whether postulate (i) implies the
x2
linearity  of  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  the  reciprocity  of
relative  velocities  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  we  know  that  the  two  equivalent
equations, the linearity of transformation and the reciprocity of relative velocities exactly lead to Lorentz
transformation.

As we pointed out in Ref.[1], an inconsistency exists in the theory formed by the two postulates

and the assumption Eqs.(1a-1b). From the assumption Eqs.(1a-1b), one can find

where Y=dX/dT is  a  real  speed  or  velocity-length,  and  yr=dxr/dt,  r=1,2,3,  is  the  well-defined  Newtonian
velocity. Eq.(2) actually embodies the pre-relativistic velocity space,

Y2= d

rsyrys,

dY2= d

rsdyrdys.

This velocity space is characterized by boundlessness and the Galilean velocity addition law in the usual
velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3. Conversely, special relativity owns the Lorentz transformation between
any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  That  exactly  indicates  a  finite  velocity  boundary  at  c  and  the
Einstein law governing velocity additions.

Experimental facts clearly support the existence of the constancy of the light speed and the local
Lorentz  invariance.  We  have  no  choice  but  to  change  the  assumption  Eqs.(1a-1b).  We  assume  that
gravity-free space and time possess the following non-Euclidean structures in the usual inertial coordinate
system {xr, t}, r=1,2,3,

      

dX2=grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)dxrdxs,   r,s=1,2,3,
dT2=g(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)dt2 ,
grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)=K2(y)d

where  dX  and  dT  are  respectively  the  real  space  and  time  differentials  between  two  neighboring  points
(x1,x2,x3,t) and (x1+dx1,x2+dx2,x3+dx3,t+dt). The non-Euclidean structures of gravity-free space and time
specified  by  two  metric  tensors  grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)  and  g(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt)  are  of  the  so-called  generalized
Finsler  geometry.  The  generalized  Finsler  geometry  is  a  generalization  of  Riemann  geometry.  It  can  be
endowed  with  the  Cartan  connection.  When  and  only  when  y  approaches  zero,  metric  tensors
grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt) and g(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt) become the Euclidean.

The  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method  is  not  all
that  each  inertial  frame  of  reference  has.  For  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  we  imagine  other
measurement  methods  which  are  different  from  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized
clock”  measurement  method.  By  taking  these  other  measurement  methods,  an  observer  in  each  inertial
frame  of  reference  can  set  up  other  inertial  coordinate  systems,  just  as  well  as  he  can  set  up  his  usual
inertial  coordinate  system  by  taking  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”
measurement  method.  We  call  these  other  inertial  coordinate  systems  the  unusual  inertial  coordinate
systems. One of the unusual inertial coordinate systems is the primed inertial coordinate system, denoted
by {x’r, t’}, r=1,2,3. The primed inertial coordinate system can be defined from the measurement point of
view. We do not do this here.

We  do  believe  in  flatness  of  gravity-free  space  and  time.  We  further  assume  that  gravity-free

space and time have the Euclidean structures in the primed inertial coordinate system,

rsdx’rdx’s,   r,s=1,2,3, 

dX2=d
dT2=dt'2 ,
anywhere and at any time.

      

 

The theory founded on two postulates (i)  and  (ii)  and  two  assumptions  Eqs.(4a-4g)  and  (5a-5b)
has  been  formed,  which  is  named  the  modified  special  relativity  theory  [4].  In  the  modified  special
relativity theory, the speed of light is the same constant c in all usual inertial coordinate systems and it is
the localized Lorentz transformation, not Lorentz transformation, which stands as a linear transformation
between any two usual inertial coordinate systems.

does,  where  y’s=dx’s/dt’,  s=1,2,3,  is  called  the  primed  velocity.  Eqs.(8)  and  (9)  represent  the  relativistic
velocity  space  in  the  primed  velocity-coordinates  {y’r},  r=1,2,3.  In  the  primed  velocity-coordinates,  the
relativistic velocity space is unbounded and its velocity additions obey the Galilean law.

We can find the relation between primed velocity y’r and Newtonian velocity yr from Eqs.(6) and

(8), and also the relation between dy’r and dyr from Eqs.(7a-7b) and (9).

Maxwell,  relying  on  two  assumptions  (a)  the  velocity  distribution  function  is  spherically
symmetric and (b) the x-, y- and z- components of velocity are statistically independent, derived his non-
relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution.  Assumptions  (a)  and  (b)  reflect  structural  characteristics  of
the  pre-relativistic  velocity  space  in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates,  represented  in  Eq.(3).  Now,  for  the
relativistic velocity space, the Euclidean structure of it in the primed velocity-coordinates convinces us of
Maxwell’s distribution of primed velocities. From this Maxwell’s distribution of primed velocities, using
those relations that we find from Eqs.(6), (7a-7b), (8) and (9), we can  obtain  the  relativistic  equilibrium
distribution of Newtonian velocities. It is

Where N is the number of particles, m is their rest mass, T is the temperature and KB is  the  Boltzmann
constant.  The  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution  fits  to  the  Maxwellian  distribution  for  low-
energy  particles  (y<<c)  but  substantially  differs  from  the  Maxwellian  distribution  for  high-energy
particles. It falls off to zero as y goes to c.

The  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution  has  been  used  to  explain  the  observed  non-
Maxwellian decay mode of high-energy tails in velocity distributions of astrophysical plasma particles [5].
The deviation of the decay mode of these high-energy tails from Maxwellian has been observed for many
years. Experimental data were mostly, if not all, modeled by the k  (kappa) distribution. As experimental
data  seem  to  be  well  modeled  by  the  kappa  distribution,  as  the  kappa  distribution  contains  a  power-law
decay  when  y  goes  to  infinity,  it  was  concluded  that  the  decay  mode  of  high-energy  tails  in  velocity
distributions of astrophysical plasma particles is power-law like. This conclusion is rather misleading. The

 is the gamma function and kappa is a parameter to be determined in
comparison  with  experimental  data.  Different  values  of  kappa  correspond  to  different  kinds  of  velocity
distribution. When and only when kappa goes to infinity, the kappa distribution becomes the Maxwellian.
The  kappa  distribution  can  not  be  a  good  modeling  distribution  for  experimental  data.  The  reasons  are:
For  any  value  of  kappa,  the  kappa  distribution  extends  as  far  as  y= ¥
,  while  the  velocity  distribution
involved  in  experimental  data  extends,  we  believe,  as  far  as  y=c;  Velocity  distribution  of  low-energy
particles,  as  observed,  can  be  well  described  by  the  Maxwellian  distribution,  but  the  kappa  distribution

with  any  finite  kappa  value  does  not  reduce  to  the  Maxwellian  even  for  small  y;  the  values  of  kappa  in
fitting  experimental  data  vary  from  event  to  event.  The  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution
predicts a new decay mode for those high-energy tails: falling off to zero, as y goes to c, slower than any
exponential decay, exp{-[2c/(c-y)]B}, and faster than any power-law decay, (c-y)n, where B and n are two
positive numbers.

The relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution has been also used to calculate the nuclear fusion
reaction  rate  [5].  To  create  a  nuclear  fusion  reaction,  a  proton  or  nucleus  must  penetrate  the  repulsive
Coulomb  barrier  and  be  close  to  another  proton  or  nucleus  so  that  the  strong  interaction  between  them
acts. The Coulomb barrier is in general much higher than thermal energy, their ratio is typically greater
than a thousand. Nuclear fusion reactions can occur only among few high-energy protons and nuclei. If,
under the  conditions  for  nuclear  fusion  reactions,  interacting  protons  and  nuclei  reach  their  equilibrium
distribution  in  the  period  of  time  that  is  infinitesimal  compared  to  the  mean  lifetime  of  nuclear  fusion
reactions,  it  is  the  equilibrium  velocity  distribution  of  these  few  high-energy  protons  and  nuclei  that
participates in determining the rate of nuclear fusion reactions. In this instance, the difference between the
Maxwellian  velocity  distribution  and  the  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution  for  high-energy
protons and nuclei is non-negligible. Figure 1 sketches the situation.

The  Maxwellian  velocity  distribution  (solid

equilibrium  velocity  distribution  (dash  line)  under  the  conditions  in  the  Sun.  As  low-
energy  protons  or  nuclei  in  shadow  area  do  not  take  part  in  solar  nuclear  fusion
reactions,  the  difference  between  the  Maxwellian  velocity  distribution  and  the
relativistic  equilibrium  velocity  distribution  for  high-energy  protons  or  nuclei  in  un-

line)  and 

In  the  situation,  it  is  inappropriate  to  use  the  Maxwellian  velocity  distribution  to  calculate  the  nuclear
fusion reaction rate. We have to use the relativistic equilibrium velocity distribution for the purpose. The
calculation  results  indicate  that  the  nuclear  fusion  reaction  rate  based  on  the  relativistic  equilibrium
distribution, R, has a reduction factor with respect to that based on the Maxwellian velocity distribution,

This inequality signifies much in resolving the solar neutrino problem. Solar neutrino problem is
a long-standing puzzle in modern physics. Its main part is the discrepancies between the measured solar
neutrino fluxes and those  predicted  by  standard  solar  models.  The  measured  solar  neutrino  fluxes  range
from  33%+/-5%  to  58%+/-7%  of  the  predicted  values.  We  have  examined  standard  solar  models.  All
standard solar models take RM as a formula for the input parameters of solar nuclear fusion reaction rates.
This  is  inappropriate.  We  should  take  R  as  a  formula  for  the  input  parameters  of  solar  nuclear  fusion
reaction rates. In doing  so,  standard  solar  models  can  be  improved.  The  relativistic  equilibrium  velocity
distribution is a possible solution to the solar neutrino problem [5].

More phenomena displaying the generalized Finslerian structures of gravity-free space and time,
including those in gravity physics and quantum physics, are being to be recognized. In the presence of a
gravitational  field,  according  to  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation,  space  and  time  co-join  to  be  a  four-
dimensional space-time, and this space-time becomes curved. The line  element  of  the  curved  space-time
can be obtained by solving the Einstein field equation. The line element usually describes a  Riemannian
manifold.  As  a  requirement,  this  line  element  must  reduce  to  the  Minkowskian  when  the  gravitational
field  is  removed  or  turned  off.  Now,  based  on  the  assumption  Eqs.(4a-4g),  some  corrections  to  the
obtained line element are necessary so as to make it reduce to the four-dimensional generalized Finslerian
structure  of  gravity-free  space-time  when  the  gravitational  field  is  removed  or  turned  off.  The  corrected
line  element  would  represent  a  generalized  Finslerian  manifold,  not  the  Riemannian  manifold.  The
generalized  Finsler  geometry  is  a  kind  of  generalization  of  Riemann  geometry.  There  would  be  new
physical phenomena involved in the generalized Finslerian manifold.

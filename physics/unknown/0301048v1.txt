Abstract 

The dynamic equilibrium between two phases at phase boundaries clearly indicates 

that in nature spontaneous changes do not necessarily proceed towards higher disorder.  

This observation is discrepant with the fundamental assumption of the microscopic 

explanation of entropy.  From this discrepancy and from other experimental results 

opposing the increase of disorder the microscopic explanation of entropy is dubious.  The 

expression of entropy has been derived from the equation of state and from the kinetic 

gas theory.  Thus, the physical parameters of EoS and the kinetic gas theory should fully 

explain the physics of entropy.  It is suggested that entropy is a variable representing an 

expression extracted from EoS and the kinetic gas theory.  This expression allows 

combining the thermal and the pressure-volume effects and provides a convenient way to 

calculate the energy change of a system induced by temperature, pressure, or volume 

changes.

The macroscopic determination of entropy first was expressed by Clausius in 1865.  

He postulated that the entropy change [

]dS

 between two equilibrium states could be 

determined by the transferred reversible heat [

]dQ

 and the absolute temperature [T] as: 

dS =

 

 

dQ
T

Employing statistical mechanics in 1877 Boltzmann suggested a microscopic 

explanation for entropy.  He stated that every spontaneous change in nature tends to 

occur in the direction of higher disorder, and entropy is the measure of that disorder.

where W is the number of microstates permissible at the same energy level,

is the 

Boltzmann constant.  This microscopic explanation of entropy has never been fully 

accepted [1-3] since there is incomplete proof for the above expression and there are 

counter examples where the increase of disorder cannot be justified. Among these 

counter examples the spontaneous crystallization of a super-cooled melt [4] and the 

crystallization of a supersaturated solution [5] are the most prominent challenges for the 

Boltzmann’s model.  If a super-cooled melt is allowed to crystallize under adiabatic 

conditions then the entropy of the system increases.  In a supersaturated solution there is 

a possibility of the deposition of crystalline solute.  This process is spontaneous with an 

increase of entropy.  A crystallization of a liquid or a deposition of a crystalline solute 

does not imply any increase in disorder.   

From a statistical mechanics aspect, a modification of the Boltzmann’s expression has 

been proposed recently by Tsallis for non equilibrium systems [6-8].  The conventional 

entropy expression can be applied when a system is in thermal equilibrium; however, for 

nonextensive systems the following expression is proposed.

When parameter q goes to 1 then equation 3 gives equation 2, which is the Boltzmann 

An investigation of the different thermodynamic processes and the microscopic 

explanation of entropy yield additional empirical evidence contrary to Boltzmann’s 

microscopic explanation.  At constant pressure and temperature a dynamic equilibrium 

develops at the boundary of two phases.  This equilibrium means that the number of 

molecules moving from phase one to phase two are the same as the number of molecules 

moving from phase two to phase one.  To maintain the continuous exchange of the 

molecules at the phase boundary does not require work, therefore, the process is a 

spontaneous one.  When a solid sublimates or a liquid evaporates the level of disorder at 

the boundary of these contacting phases is extremely different; however, preferred 

movements of the molecules toward higher disorder have never been observed.  The 

dynamic equilibrium between different phases is contrary to the fundamental assumption

of the Boltzmann’s model.  This observation along with other experimental results, 

opposing the increase of disorder, questions the physical explanation of entropy, which 

will be considered in detail below. 

From investigating the kinetic gas model it can be concluded that any thermodynamic 

system possesses two kinds of energy: thermal energy, and pressure-volume energy.  The 

thermal energy is the energy of the molecules while the pressure-volume energy is the 

energy needed to constrain the boundary of the system.  The thermal energy of a 

monoatomic gas [ E

where n is the number of moles

be written as:

If the conditions of the system are changing then the energies resulting from these 

changes either has to be supplied to or to be released from the system.  Allowing each 

physical parameter to change the energy change of the system can be calculated as:

   In conclusion, it has been shown that the formula of entropy can be derived from EoS 

and from the kinetic gas theory.  Thus, the physical parameters of EoS and the kinetic gas 

theory should fully explain the physics of entropy.  It is suggested that entropy is a 

variable representing an expression extracted from EoS and the kinetic gas theory.  This 

expression allows combining the thermal and the pressure-volume effects and provides a 

convenient way to calculate the energy change of a system induced by temperature, 

pressure, or volume changes.

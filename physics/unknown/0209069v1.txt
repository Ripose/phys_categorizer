ABSTRACT   The origin of chirality, closely related to the evolution of life on the earth, has long been 

debated. In 1991, Abdus Salam suggested a novel approach to achieve biomolecular homochirality by 

a  phase  transition.  In  his  subsequent  publication,  he  predicted  that  this  phase  transition  could 

eventually change D-amino acids to L-amino acids as C -H bond would break and H atom became a 

α

superconductive  atom.  Since  many  experiments  denied  the  configuration  change  in  amino  acids, 

Salam hypothesis aroused suspicion. This paper is aimed to provide direct experimental evidence of a 

phase  transition  in  alanine,  valine  single  crystals  but  deny  the  configuration  change  of  D-  to  L- 

enantiomers. New views on Salam phase transition are presented to revalidate its great importance in 

the origin of homochirality.

ORIGIN OF BIOMOLECULAR HOMOCHIRALITY 

        

In  1848,  Pasteur  first observed  that crystals  formed  from  a  salt  of  tartaric acid  were  of two 

types, each one a mirror image of the other. He also discovered that solutions of each type of these 

crystals  rotated  polarized  light  in  opposite  directions.  Now  we  all  know  the  two  types  of  crystals 

correspond to mirror-symmetric arrangements of atoms in the molecule. The origin of the chiral purity 

( L-amino acids and D-sugar are dominant in living organisms) has been a constant preoccupation in

biology,  but  the  problem  is  not  solved  yet.  Among  those  hypotheses  concerning  this  problem,  two 

main  directions  are  obvious  to  be  summarized  as  whether  homochirality  is  the  consequence  of  a 

chance process or is induced by an asymmetric physical force. Competing autocatalysis, asymmetric 

adsorption,  and  the  symmetry  fractures  during  crystallization  belong  to  the  “abiotic”  explanations, 

which describe the occurrence of homochirality in biomolecules as accidental. The basic concept of 

the alternative “determined mechanism” is an external physical interaction, which is able to produce 

an  enantiomerically  enhanced  product  from  an  optically  inactive  starting  material,  or  which  utilizes 

chirality already intrinsic to the molecule. 

          

In 1957, Lee and Yang discovered the parity violation effect in weak interactions [1]. Then it 

became probably the most promising physical effect for inducing effects on a macroscopic scale. Soon 

after  the  unification  of  weak  and  electromagnetic  interactions,  it  was  realized  that  different 

enantiomers would possess different physical properties, due to the existence of neutral weak currents. 

Ab  initio  calculation  were  carried  out  for  various  amino-acids  in  aqueous  solutions  showing  parity 

violating energy differences of the order of 10-17 kT; this corresponds to an excess of approximately 

10-17 for the molecules of lower energy, a very small number indeed [2]. Some orders of magnitude 

can be gained if one considers instead some other (heavier) biomolecules, but an immense gap is still 

to be bridged before a connection is established with biomolecular homochirality. 

Before  Salam  phase  transition  theory,  other  hypotheses  had  been  suggested  to  explain 

homochirality.  One  of  the  principal  difficulties  in  understanding  the  asymmetry  of  biomolecules 

involves  the  amplification  mechanism  that  would  boost  a  primordial  small  physical  effect.  All 

suggestions concerning amplification mechanism should consequently be considered seriously: 

1. Amplification of the Vester-Ulbricht processes, namely, amplification mechanisms that may apply 

to the  interaction  of  polarized particles  with  biomolecules [3].  This hypothesis  postulated that when 

the  longitudinally  polarized  electrons  produced  by  parity  violation  during 

-decay  impinged  on 

matter  to  generate  circularly  polarized  Bremsstrahlung  photons,  these  in  turn  could  be  absorbed  by 

organic substrates, thereby inducing stereoselective synthetic or degradative reactions of sorts known 

 

2 

to be brought about by circularly polarized light. The overall result would be the abiotic generation of 

chiral organic products.  

2. Amplification of the Yamagata processes, namely, processes in which the breakdown of the discrete 

P  symmetry  is  considered  as  a  possible  source  of  biochirality  [4].  The  accumulation  principle 

suggested by Yamagata conjectures that a small difference 

in the rate for L-molecules to form pure 

L-polymer  vs.  the  rate  for  D-molecules  to  form  pure  D-polymer  will  eventually  lead  to 

n-times 

more L polymer of n members than D-polymer of n members from racemic monomer solution. 

3.  Amplification  such  as  the  Kondepudi-Nelson  catastrophic  mechanism  [5].  According  to  this,  the 

small electroweak energy difference between the enantiomers is sufficient to determine which of the 

two single-enantiomer reaction sequences was adopted at the metastable stage in the flow reactor that 

is off the thermodynamic equilibrium 

It  had  been  suggested  that  Bose-Einstein  condensation  is  a  novel  approach  to  achieve 

homochirality.  This  theory  is  suggested  by  Abdus  Salam,  which  we  will  discuss  in  detail  in  the 

following section of this paper. 

 

SALAM PHASE TRANSITION IN AMINO ACIDS 

In 1991, in order to explain the origin of homochirality, Professor Abdus Salam suggested a 

possible phase transition in amino acids [6]. Starting from Z0  interactions, he proposed that a quantum 

mechanical cooperative and condensation phenomena (possibly in terms of an e-n condensate where 

the  e-n  system  has  the  same  status  as  Cooper-pairing)  give  rise  to  a  second-order  phase  transition.   

Based on BCS theory, gauge field theory and Higgs mechanism, he calculated the critical temperature 

for  this  phase  transition.  A  crucial  form  for  the  transition  temperature  Tc  involves  dynamical 

symmetry breaking. The idea is supposed to start from the Feynman Lagrangian methodology of the 

BCS theory for the superconducting electronic system. From Ginzburg-Landau equation, the value of 

temperature Tc is deduced. By using Sakita’s formulation, the following result is presented

Here  ϕ  field  is  expressed  as  a  complex  auxiliary  Higgs  scalar  field,  geff    is  an  attractive 

coupling constant between spin up and spin down electrons, θ is the Weinberg angle. Salam took (1-

4sin2 θ) ≈ 1/13, σ(0)=mz

2 with the empirical value of the parameter sin2θ ≈ 0.231, and got geff σ(0) ≈ 1. 

In  Salam’s  subsequent  publications  [7]  (also  some  publication  of  Chela-Flores  [8][9])  ,  he 

predicted  that  this  phase  transition  can  eventually  change  D-alanine  to  L-alanine  as  C -H  bond 

α

would break and H atom become a superconductive atom. He had also proposed some experimental 

method  to  test  his  hypothesis:  The  first  way  to  test  for  evidence  is  to  lower  the  temperature  while 

measuring the optical activity of a crystalline DL-alanine, D-alanine, L-alanine, when polarized light 

is shone upon a particular amino acid. If the polarization vector gets rotated, one may be sure that the 

appropriate  phase  transition  has  taken  place.  The  second  way  of  detecting  the  process  may  be  by 

measuring  differences  of  specific  heats  and  looking  for    anomalies  in  the  curve  C  = γ  T  + β  T 

3 

+…like Mizutani have done for the non-amino acids like melanins and tumor melanosomes. Note that 

ideally Salam would be able to compute the values of Tc  when electroweak interaction is fully worked 

out.  The  analogy  of  the  “superfluidity”  exhibited  by  amino  acids  is  to  “superfluidity”  in 

superconductors. In the case of superconductivity, the third way for a given amino acid is to apply an 

external magnetic field and look for the Meissner effect to determine Tc. 

 

EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FOR A PHASE TRANSITION 

Following  Salam’s  suggestion,  our  group  at  Peking  University  led  by  Professor  Wang 

Wenqing  has  spent  8  years  in  searching  for  experimental  evidence  for  Salam  phase  transition.  A 

variety of experiments have been conducted to validate the existence of a phase transition. Since some 

of  the  experiment  results  have  already  been  published  [10][11][12],  here  we  only  give  a  brief 

summarization of each experiment.

Experimental: Sample preparation/characterization 

The  amino  acids  were  obtained  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  All  single  crystals  were 

crystallized by slow evaporation of saturated aqueous solutions. D-/L-alanine and D-/L-valine single 

crystals  were  characterized  by  elemental  analysis  (C,  H  and  N)  and  a  good  agreement  was  shown 

between  the  theoretical  and  experimental  data  [13].  By  using  X-ray  diffraction  crystallography  at 

293K,  the  cell  dimensions  of  D-/  L-alanine  crystals  were  determined  as  the  same  space  group 

P21P21P21, orthorhombic, a = 6.0250 Å, b = 12.3310 Å, c = 5.7841 Å, V = 429.72 Å3. The data for D-

/L- valine crystals showed a space group P21, monoclinic, a= 9.6686 Å, b = 5.2556 Å, c = 11.9786 Å, 

V = 608.64 Å3. It indicates that all crystals are pure single crystals containing no crystal water. The 

rotation angle ζ of the D- and L- alanine solution was measured on Polarimeter PE-241 MC at 293 K 

with the wavelength of 589.6 nm. By using the formula of [ α ] = ζ / (L × C), the corresponding α 

values of D- and L-alanine were shown to be the same. 

 

In  order  to  maintain  the  authenticity  and  accuracy  of  these  experiments,  we  use  dozens  of 

pure single crystals for our series of experiments. We use different crystal in different experiment and 

all these results have been repeated.  

1. Specific heat measurement 

The temperature dependence of the specific heats for the D-, L- alanine and valine are shown 

in Fig .1-3 .An obvious 

transition was observed at 270

1 K in both alanine and valine enantiomers 

by differential scanning calorimetry with an adiabatic continuous heating method. With all the other 

conditions being equal, it is also shown that the specific heat Cp value of D-valine is larger than that of 

L-valine and the same existed in the enantiomers of alanine. In all cases, the biologically dominant L-

enantiomer is found to have lower energy, and the specific heat value reflects this fact.

2.DC-Magnetic susceptibilities measurements 

Magnetic  moment  (m)  and  magnetic  susceptibility  (χρ)  of  D-/  L-alanine  crystals  were 

measured by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-5) from 200K to 300K at a field of 

1.0T  (with  differential  sensitivity  1E-8  emu  to  1  Tesla)  in  the  National  Laboratory  for 

Superconductivity,  Institute  Physics  Chinese  Academy  of  Sciences.  Crystals  were  weighed  and 

determined to be 174.1mg (D-alanine), 99.5mg (L-alanine), then transferred to the straw. The signal 

from the plastic straw was canceled out while the temperature was measured.

Fig. 4 Temperature dependence of mass susceptibility at a field of 1.0 T 

               Magnetization  measurements  (shown  in  Fig.4)  have  shown  alanine  enantiomers  to  be 

dimagnetic, since they have even numbers of electrons which form closed magnetically neutral shells. 

It  is  clearly  indicated  that,  both  values  and  variations  of  magnetic  susceptibilities  of  D-/  L-  alanine 

enantiomers keep the same when the temperature is above 240K, and there is not distinct difference 

between  them.  It  can  also  be  found  that,  when  temperature  approaches  240K  from  higher  ones,  the 

change  of χρ    values  becomes  slow  and  subsiding.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  temperature  falls 

below 240K, D-alanine undergoes a magnetic phase transition as the χρ  values showed a maximum 

near  240K,  while χρ   values  of  L  -alanine  go  on  increasing  but  the  rate  of  variation  experiences  an 

abrupt rise, which should also be looked as a magnetic phase transition and its mechanism is clearly 

distinct with that of D-alanine crystal. The experimental results are repeatable for the same samples 

after  several  thermal  circles  from  200K  to  300K,  and  both  the  magnitudes  of  χρ    values  and  the 

transition  temperatures  of  D-alanine  crystal  are  almost  the  same  for  the  different  thermal  circles, 

which indicates that these changes are completely reversible for D- and L-alanine crystals. 

Meaningfully,  while  the  temperature  varies  in  the  range  of  200~240K, χρ   values  of  D-/L- 

alanine are nearly opposite and symmetry with the χρ  value (χρ= – 5.185×10-7 cm3/g) of D-/L- alanine 

at 240K taken as the base value, which may show some clues for the weak neutral current playing a 

 

7 

contrary  even  parity-violating  role  in  magnetic  behavior  of  molecules  of  D-alanine  and  L-alanine 

crystals in this temperature range.  

3.1H CRAMPS solid state NMR measurements 

 1H  NMR  multipulse  spectra  were  run  on  a  Varian  InfinityPlus–400  spectrometer  with 

resonance  frequency  400.12  MHz.  A  4mm  Chemagnetics  double  probe  was  used  for  the  variable 

temperature CRAMPS experiment. A BR-24 multiple sequence was employed with a π/2 pulse width 

of 1.6 µs and 64 scans with a 2s recycle delay to acquire CRAMPS spectra. Spin rate was 2.5 kHz and 

the  number  of  scans  was  64.  Chemical  shifts  were  referenced  to  tetramethylsilane  (TMS)  for  1H 

measurements.

Fig .5 Temperature dependence of peak widths of 

-H, 

-H of D-/L-alanine crystals 

For the sake of investigating the temperature-dependent nuclei dynamics of D- and L-alanine 

molecules,  we  measured  the  width  of  α-H  and  β-H  peaks  of  D-/L-alanine.  Fig.5  displays  that  four 

peak’s width of α-H and β-H experience distinct maximum around 240K. So we conjecture that both 

D-/L-alanine may undergo a phase transition at this temperature range. 

As for the L-alanine, the variation degrees of peak widths of

-H, 

-H peaks make a good 

agreement (the maximum peak width is about two times as large as that in room temperature) in the 

 

8 

whole process, which indicates that the temperature-dependent relaxation effects of 

-H, 

-H nuclei 

of  L-alanine  molecule  are  nearly  the  same  in  the  transition  process.  In  the  case  of  D-alanine,  the 

variation of 

-H peak width is much fiercer than that of its enantiomer in the transition temperature 

range  (220~250K),  in  addition,  its  transition  temperature  seems  nearer  to  240K  instead  of  230K. 

Considering  the  relative  stability  of  magnetic  field  in  the  whole  experimental  process,  these  results 

show that, in this specific transition, the spin-spin relaxation and spin-lattice relaxation mechanism of 

-H nucleus of D-alanine molecule may be different from that of L-alanine, and its relaxation effects 

may also stronger than its enantiomer.  

4.Ultrasonic attenuation measurements 

 The  measurements  of  ultrasonic  attenuation  values  of  D-/L-alanine  were  performed  on  a 

computer  controlled  ultrasonic  system  (Matec  model  7700).  A  ceramic  transducer  for  generating  a 

longitudinal ultrasonic wave was used. The frequency of ultrasonic wave is 5 MHz. The attenuation α 

value was calculated from

where  d  is  the  thickness  of  the  sample,  A(x1)  and  A(x2)  are  the  amplitudes  of  the  first  and  second 

echoes  respectively.  The  samples  used  for  ultrasonic  measurements  were  D-  and  L-alanine  crystals 

with  thickness  equal  to  3.00  and  2.70  mm.  The  transducer  was  fixed  properly  to  ensure  the  contact 

with the sample and there was no air between them. The temperature of the sample was controlled by 

a thermocouple. In this way we can gain the ultrasonic attenuation values at various temperatures. For 

the  sake  of  detecting  and  describing  the  difference  of  both  phase  transitions  mechanisms  more 

precisely,  relative  attenuation  values  curve  for  either  enantiomer  was  drew,  respectively:  the 

maximum  attenuation  value  of  either  enantiomer  was  chosen  as 

max  ,  the  other  temperature-

dependent 

 values were normalized by dividing them with 

max . The experiments were performed 

for the cooling process from 290K to 200K.

Fig.6 The relative attenuation values of D-/L-alanine crystals vs its temperature 

The results of ultrasonic measurements are shown in Figure.6. As for the D-alanine crystal, the 

attenuation value changes continuously and undergoes an obvious peak around 247K, and the curve is 

symmetry on the whole. In the case of L-alanine crystal, a precipitous step-form drop of attenuation 

value was found around 247K. These ultrasonic attenuation phase transition temperatures agree with 

the  1H  Solid  state  NMR  and  DC-magnetic  susceptibilities  measurements.  It  is  quite  clear  that,  for 

these two crystal samples, the shapes of relative attenuation curves of the enantiomers and transition 

mechanisms  are  quite  different  from  each  other.  So  we  suppose  the  ultrasonic  investigations 

demonstrate  the  contribution  of  the  parity-violating  WNC  to  the  elastic  relaxation  effects  acting  in 

both ultrasonic transitions of D-alanine and L-alanine crystals. 

5.Temperature-dependent optical rotation measurement  

This is the first method suggested by Salam to testify the phase transition. The temperature-

dependent optical rotation angle result of DL racemic alanine was performed on a solid state optical 

measure system and the result was shown in Fig.7. The ϕ value is equal to − 0.5° (approach to zero) 

from  290K  to  252K.  It  proves  that  the  crystal  is  truly  racemic.  However,  when  the  temperature 

continuously decreases from 260K pass through 252K to 230K, the ϕ value is rapidly decreasing to − 

4.5° showing an obvious characteristic phase transition. The experimental results are repeatable over 

several  thermal  circles  from  230K  through  to  290K,  which  indicates  that  these  behaviors  are 

completely reversible for DL- alanine crystal. For different DL- alanine crystal samples, we observed 

 

10 

the  same  temperature-dependent  ϕ    behavior  characterized  by  approximately  the  same  transition 

temperature.

6.Temperature-dependent Raman studies 

Vibration  spectra  of  DL-alanine  single  crystals,  which  were  measured  in  above  optical 

rotation  angle  experiments,  were  performed  on  a  Ranishaw  1000  fitted  with  argon-ion  laser  model. 

The temperature was monitored from 290K to 230K by a digital temperature controller unit having a 

stability of 0.1K. As in the optical rotation angle measurements, the laser beam also propagated along 

the c axis perpendicular to the {110} face. The experimental conditions were as follows: exciting line, 

514.5nm, and power, 50mW; the width of slit of the triple monochromator, 50 m; scanning range, 

100-3600cm-1; signal averaging, 3 scans.

The  most  striking  and  considerably  important  result  of  this  part  of  study  is  the  apparent 

different  Raman  spectra  behavior  of  DL  racemic  alanine  crystal  when  temperature  approaches  the 

 

12 

transition temperature Tc. A careful observation of this phase transition by Raman spectra showed that 

(according  to  the  assignment  of  peaks  in  reference  ):  (1)  the  relative  intensity  of  3002  cm-1  (Cα−H 

stretching)  is  weaker  than  that  of  2953  cm-1  only  at  250K  (shown  in  Fig.  8),  (2)  the  relative  peak 

intensity  of  1411  cm-1  peak  (COO-  symmetric  bending)  is  weaker  than  that  of  1483  cm-1  (Cα−H 

bending) only at 250K in the whole temperature region (shown in Fig. 9). These phenomena imply the 

abrupt change of vibration particulars of Cα−H bond and COO- group at the transition point around 

250K, which suggests the contribution of Cα−H bond and COO- group made to the phase transition 

process of DL- alanine crystal. 

Conclusion 

From above series of experimental results, the existence of a phase transition around 250K in 

alanine  crystals  has  been  fully  proved.  Although  the  specific  and  detailed  transition  mechanism  is 

unclear,  we  may  at  least  draw  a  cautious  conclusion  that  there  exists  a  phase  transition  in  alanine 

crystals  and  in  the  transition  process,  D-,  L-,  and  DL-  alanine  crystals  exhibit  different  transition 

behavior.  

 

EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE THAT DENY THE CONFIGURATION CHANGE 

In 1993, Figureau et al. conducted a series of scrupulously performed experiments to test the 

validity of Salam’s predictions [14][15]. They observed no change in optical rotation after exposing 

both racemic DL-cystine and L-cystine to temperature ranging from 77K to 0.6K for three and four 

days, thus reported failing to validate PVED-induced phase transitions predicted by Salam. That is the 

most famous experiments that refute Salam’s predictions. 

In  addition  to  Figureau’s  experiments,  a  more  direct  method  to  testify  Salam’s  phase 

transition is to conduct temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction investigations 

on  enantiomers.  If  a  configuration  change  of  D-  to  L-  has  occurred,  it  will  be  easy  to  catch  this 

phenomenon because we will find an abrupt change in atom coordinates.

temperature on a Siemens R3m/V diffractometer with Mo--Kx ( =0.71073Å) radiation. The structure 

λ

is solved by direct methods and subsequent Fourier Differential Techniques and refined by full-Matrix 

least  squares  using  the  SHELXTL  PLUS  program.  All  non-hydrogen  atoms  are  refined  with 

anisotropic thermal parameters. 

 

The result of variable temperature X-ray studies shows little or no evidence for structural or 

geometrical changes in this temperature range. Extended neutron diffraction investigation of both D- 

and  L-  alanine  at  250K  and  60K  has  been  recently  performed  at  Rutherford  Appleton  Laboratory, 

which also shows a negative answer to the predicted configuration change of D- to L-. 

Other  evidence  we  can  use  to  deny  the  configuration  change  is  the  temperature-dependent 

Raman studies of DL racemic alanine crystals which has already been mentioned in the above section. 

Compared with the reported Raman spectra of D- and L-alanine crystal, we may notice that the Raman 

spectra of DL- alanine in low temperature are still quite different from those of pure isomers such as 

D-  or  L-  alanine.  This  comparison  indicates  that  the  D-  molecule  in  DL-  crystal  has  not  actually 

 

15 

changed into L- isomer in the phase transition process. Since Raman spectroscopy is an accurate and 

useful method in obtaining information with reference to the molecular conformation, these results are 

convincing. Furthermore, on the contrary, if a supposed configuration change has taken place in the 

phase  transition  process  as  the  molecule  undergoes  a  complete  change  in  3-dimensions,  the 

corresponding temperature-dependent Raman spectra will show abrupt and obvious changes in most 

peaks  in  stead  of  the  only  slight  changes  in  a  particular  spectra  range  as  we  have  discussed  in  the 

above section. 

The  last  but  the  most  important  question  we  intend  to  discuss  is  why  we  have  observed  an 

optical rotation change in DL-alanine but still deny the configuration change. Here we can not avoid 

introducing some quantum theory about optical activity: 

 

The  rotation  of  plane-polarized  light  by  chiral  molecules  arises  from  the  difference  in  the 

index of refraction for left and right circularly polarized light. The rotation angle depends on chemical 

bonding  and  molecular  conformation.  In  optical-active  medium,  the  fundamental  equations  of

using  quantum  mechanics  shows  that  the  interference  of  the  electric  dipole  and  magnetic  dipole 

produces the optical rotation effect in optical active medium. To perform this calculation on alanine 

crystal, not only the contributions of single atoms should be included, but also all the chemical bonds 

and  the  molecular  conformation  must  be  considered.  Freedman  had  proposed  a  model  via 

vibrationally generated electronic ring currents to explain the optical rotation effect [16]. In the case of 

alanine  crystal,  the  C

α−H  stretch  generates  an  oscillating  electronic  current  in  a  molecular  ring, 

adjacent to the methine bond, which is closed by hydrogen bonding. This oscillating ring current gives 

rise to a large magnetic dipole transition moment m (Fig.11). Since the vibration intensities of Cα−H

bending  and  stretching  modes  are  very  sensitive  to  the  change  of  electric  dipole  moment 

µ

 in  the 

vibrationally generated electronic ring currents model, the sudden intensity shift of 1483 cm

-1 (Cα−H 

bending) and 3002 cm-1 (Cα−H stretching) modes suggests the sudden variation of the electric dipole 

moment 

µ

 in  DL-  alanine  crystal  at  250K.  This  phenomenon  is  of  great  importance  as  for  the 

understanding of measurement results of temperature-dependent optical rotation angle. 

What is more, in the electronic ring currents model, the abrupt change of vibration particulars 

of  COO-  group  displayed  by  intensity  analysis  of  1411  cm-1  peak  will  surely  accompanied  by  the 

alteration  of  relative  atom  position  and  electron  distribution  of  the  five-atom  ring,  which  will 

inevitably  make  the  producing  process  ( →m  )  of  the  magnetic  dipole  transition  moment  vary 

µ

significantly. 

Since

µ µ

 and  →m of DL- alanine all undergo a sudden change in their magnitudes at T

c, it 

is  reasonable  to  observe  the  variation  of  optical  rotation  angle  in  this  phase  transition  because  it  is 

closely  related  to  Im  (

µ

•

m).This  observation  strongly  indicates  a  phase  transition  and  it  will 

certainly induce a great change in the electric dipole moment

and also causes the slight variation of 

µ

other  atoms’  positions  and  a  change  of  Dihedral  angle(45.32°→43.97°),  which  will  bring  another 

change in the magnetic dipole moment m. From this point of view, since

, m all undergo a change in 

µ

their magnitude, it is natural to observe the variation of rotation angle in this phase transition because 

it is closely related to Im (

µ

•

m).  

What  we  intend  to  emphasize  here  is  the  variation  of  rotation  angle  can  not  be  simply  and 

solely  interpreted  as  the  configuration  change  of  D→L.  As  we  have  already  presented,  the  optical 

rotation is closely related to Im (

m), so change of magnitude of Im (

µ •

µ •

m) will also bring about 

this phenomenon. 

 

NEW VIEWS ON SALAM PHASE TRANSITION 

 

18 

 

It  seems  a  contradiction  to  admit  the  existence  of  Salam  phase  transition  but  deny  the 

configuration  of  D-  to  L-  since  Salam  hypothesis.  All  those  experimental  evidence  suggest  an 

adaptation  of  Salam  hypothesis.  We  may  divide  Salam  hypothesis  into  two  parts:  1.  Theoretical 

deduction  of  a  specific  phase  transition  based  on  quantum  mechanics  and  BCS  theory.  2.  His 

prediction  of  a  configuration  change  of  D-  to  L-  during  the  phase  transition  process.  All  the 

experiments that refute Salam hypothesis are actually against the second part of his hypothesis not the 

first part. A better definition of Salam phase transition should be: a phase transition in which D- and 

L- enantiomers exhibit different transition behavior.  

Although  Salam’s  hypothesis  has  failed  to  explain  homochirality  only  via  this  phase 

transition,  the  significance  of  the  different  behavior  between  D-  and  L-  amino  acids  in  the  phase 

transition  will  never  be  overlooked.  The  parity  violation  effect  in  weak  interaction  has  made 

enantiomers  different.  Berger  and  Quack’s  study  in  a  detailed  analysis  of  dynamic  chirality  proved 

that the dihedral angle between the O2C and C -H planes plays an important role in determining the 

α

intrinsic  energies  of  the  alanine  molecules  and  this  difference  has  been  used  in  the  calculation  of 

Parity  Violating  Energy  Difference  (PVED)  [17].  The  dihedral  angles  are  calculated  from  the 

coordinates of O(1) O(2) C(1) C(2) H(1) of D- and L- alanine (Table1). The most striking result of 

this  study  is  the  apparent  difference  in  the  dihedral  angle  between  D-  and  L-  alanine  at  250K 

(D:43.97°  L:45.72°) while in other temperature they are almost the same. Quack has also proved that 

the difference between enantiomers induced by weak neutral currents is too minor to be detected by 

experimental methods under normal conditions nowadays [18]. But as we have already illustrated, D-, 

L-, and DL- alanine crystals display distinct behavior in all experimental methods in the specific phase 

transition  process.  A  possible  explanation  could  be:  the  minor  difference  between  D-  and  L- 

enatiomers  (PVED:  about  10

-18  -  10-17  eV)  has  been  enlarged  to  a  detective  level  during  this  phase 

transition due to the  quantum mechanical cooperative and condensation phenomena, it will become 

the foundation of later amplification mechanism.  

Establishing chemical systems that are thermodynamically far from equilibrium, Kondepudi 

and  Nelson  succeeded  in  simulating  the  evolution  of  dominant  chirality  by  nonlinear  analysis  of 

 

19 

chemical  reactions.  If  we  take  the  specific  phase  transition  into  consideration,  the  enlarged  energy 

difference will greatly shorten the time period needed in their model to achieve homochirality and it 

will  also  reduce  the  total  number  of  molecules  that  this  system  must  have  in  order  to  surmount 

fluctuation.  

What is worth emphasizing, according to Salam, the occurrence of Salam phase transition can 

enhance the PVED a lot, which will in turn induce much higher probability of transition. This kind of 

nonlinear feedback relation is similar with that in Kondepudi-Nelson scenario : when the PVED value 

is larger by one to two orders of magnitude than anticipated, the time required to realize homochirality 

in a 100m 100m 4m lake reduces from 104 year to one year[19][20].  In fact, nonlinear effects in 

asymmetric synthesis and stereoselective reactions have been widely discovered and studied [21][22]. 

A  recently  published  experiment  showed  that  the  chiral  amplification  of  oligopeptides  in  two-

dimensional crystalline self-assemblies on water also introduces nonlinear effects [23]. 

Significantly, this system meets well the formation requirements of a dissipative structure 

 

the  critical  transition  point  is  far  from  equilibrium;  The  control  parameter  PVED,  whose  value 

determines  the  probability  of  Salam  phase  transition,  has  a  transition  threshold;  the  occurrence  of 

Salam phase transition will in turn enlarge PVED nonlinearly. Hence, if the temperature is kept in the 

transition  temperature  range  all  along,  the  control  parameter  PVED  can  exceed  its  critical  value 

(threshold) for enough time, and it is possible to form a dissipative structure and finally develop into 

an  ordered  and  homochiral  system.  This  scenario  is  being  tested  in  our  laboratory.  A  related  and 

interesting phenomenon was reported by Ellis-Evans et al.[24]: a great lake Lake Vostok lies below 

a flowing ice sheet, and the melting point temperature is –3.15 º C (270K). Microbiological studies of 

the  Vostok  ice  core  have  revealed  a  great  diversity  of  microbes  including  yeasts  and  actinomycetes 

(with  antibiotic  synthesizing  potential)  which  remain  viable  in  ice  for  up  to  3000  years,  and  viable 

mycelial fungi up to 38600 years old. 

At  last,  we  emphasize  again  the  significance  of  Salam  phase  transition  in  the  evolution  of 

homochirality:  instead  of  an  ultimate  solution  to  the  problem,  it  actually  plays  as  a  first  step  of 

 

20 

amplification  mechanism.  It  connects  the  microcosmic  difference  (PVED)  between  biomolecular 

enantiomers with nonlinear process in a macrocosmic biological system. It also solves the long-term 

debating suspicion that PVED is too minor to be enlarged directly by nonlinear process.  

Combining  the  existence  of  PVED,  Salam  phase  transition  and  nonlinear  amplification 

mechanism, we may propose a sound way to understand the chemical evolution of homochirality as 

depicted in Fig. 12.

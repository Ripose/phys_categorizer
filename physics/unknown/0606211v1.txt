ABSTRACT 

This  work  reports  single-frequency  laser  oscillation  at  λ  =  1003.4  nm  of  an  optically  pumped  external  cavity 
semiconductor  laser.  By  using  a  gain  structure  bonded  onto  a  high  conductivity  substrate,  we  demonstrate  both 
theoretically  and  experimentally  the  strong  reduction  of  the  thermal  resistance  of  the  active  semiconductor  medium, 
resulting in a high power laser emission. The spectro-temporal dynamics of the laser is also explained. Furthermore, an 
intracavity frequency-doubling crystal was used to obtain a stable single-mode generation of blue (λ = 501.5 nm) with an 
output power around 60 mW.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Optically  pumped  Vertical-External-Cavity  Surface  Emitting  Lasers  (VECSEL’s)  combine  the  approaches  of  diode-
pumped solid-state lasers and engineered semiconductor lasers, generating both circular diffraction limited output beams 
and high average powers [1,2]. However the poor thermal conductivity of III-V materials might prevent an efficient heat 
removal from the active region, which results in an excessive heating of the semiconductor structure incompatible with 
high power emission. Mainly two solutions have been described in the literature: first growing the structure upside down 
and removing the GaAs substrate to dissipate the heat directly through the Bragg mirror [1,3]; or secondly removing the 
heat through the top of the semiconductor structure by bonding it to a material of high thermal conductivity and good 
optical  quality  [2,4,5].  In 
transfer 
temperature sensitive  components  without  introducing  additional  strains.  This  technique  benefits  from  a  relatively  low 
bonding temperature (~200° C) and a good temperature stability of the bond since the melting point of the AuIn2 alloy is 
480° C.  Further  high temperature  processing  steps,  such  as  plasma  enhanced  vapor phase  deposition  of  dielectric 
materials, are thus possible without dissolving the AuIn2 bond. 
Output  powers  up  to  500  mW  in  a  single  transverse  and  longitudinal  mode  have  been  obtained  at  1003  nm  from  an 
optically  pumped  ½  VCSEL  bonded  onto  a  SiC  heatspreader.  Furthermore,  intracavity  second  harmonic  generation  is 
reported at the blue-green wavelength of 501.5 nm, which corresponds to a hyperfine transition of the molecular iodine 
(127I2) of great interest in metrological applications as well as in high-resolution spectroscopy [6,7].

2. ½ - VCSEL STRUCTURE FOR THERMAL MANAGEMENT 

2.1 Gain structure design and fabrication 
The λL=1010 nm ½ -VCSEL designed for λp=808 nm pumping used in the present work was grown by MOCVD on a 
350  µm  –  thick  GaAs  (100)  substrate  [8].  The  multilayer  Bragg  mirror  is  made  with  27.5 pairs  of  GaAs/AlAs.  The 
3.75 λ-thick  active  region  consists  of NQW = 5  compressively  strained LQW=7 nm  InGaAs/GaAs  quantum  wells  (QWs) 
distributed  among  the  7  optical  standing-wave  antinode  positions  with  a  distribution  function  1-1-1-0-1-0-1  (starting 
from  the  top  surface)  such  as  the  carrier  density  remains  almost  equal  in  all  QWs.  We  have  optimized  the  number  of 
QWs to obtain a low laser threshold and a large differential gain at 300 K with 1% of total optical cavity losses [9]. The 
low  number  of  QWs,  as  compared  to  other  published  designs,  avoids  the  need  to  grow  strain-compensating  layers 
between  the  QWs  [1-4].  On  top  of  the  gain  region  a  30 nm  AlAs  confinement  layer  and  an  8 nm  caping  layer  were 
added. 

A second structure, with exactly the same layers but an AlGaAs etch-stop layer between the GaAs substrate and 
the Bragg mirror, was grown on reverse order on a GaAs substrate for further processing. This ½-VCSEL was bonded 
onto  a  280-µm  thick  Si  substrate  (thermal  conductivity  of  κs1  =150  W/m/K)  on  the  Bragg  mirror  side  by  solid-liquid 
inter-diffusion (SLID) bonding with AuIn2 (figure 1) [10]. A 30 nm-thick Ti layer was first evaporated on both the ½ -
VCSEL  and  the  SiC  heatspreader  to  improve  adhesion  and  to  prevent  diffusion.  Next,  a  150 nm  –thick  Au  layer  was 
deposited  on  the  SiC  substrate.  On  top  of  the  active  structure  we  added  Au  (150  nm)  and  In  (600  nm)  layers;  then  a 
20 nm-thick  Au  layer  was  deposited  to  prevent  the  oxidation  of  the  Indium  layer  prior  to  bonding.  The  bonding 
temperature  was  200° C,  which  was  a  trade-off  between  the  diffusion  speed  and  the  strain  introduced  by  the  bonding 
process  due  to  the  different  thermal  expansion  coefficients  of  both  materials.  A  pressure  of  about  250 kg / cm²  was 
applied to provide a good surface contact of the two wafers while the temperature was ramped to 200° C and maintained 
at this temperature for two hours. The pressure was kept constant during the cooling-down process. The final thickness of 
the  AuIn2  bonding  layer  was  found  to  be  0.9  µm.  Then  both  mechanical  polishing  and  wet  selective  etching  at  room 
temperature was utilized to remove the GaAs substrate. Finally, a Si3N4 anti-reflection coating was deposited by plasma 
enhanced  chemical  vapor  phase  deposition  (PECVD)  at  high  temperature  (280° C)  to  protect  the  top  surface  from 
oxidation and to weaken the residual etalon resonances of the semiconductor structure.

structure interface reflection of about 6%, and a calculated pump absorption at λP = 808  nm of nearly 70 % in the barrier 
layers, the fraction of incident pump power absorbed in the active region is evaluated to Ap=66%. The remaining 30% 
pump power is absorbed in the GaAs layers of the Bragg mirror.

low-power excitation before the AR coating deposition. The residual etalon effect of the ½ -VCSEL 
remains visible on the reflectivity spectrum around 1.0 µm. 

2.2 Theoretical and experimental evaluation of the thermal properties of the gain structures 
The heat diffusion in the whole semiconductor structure has been theoretically studied assuming a perfect metal bonding 
between the Bragg mirror and the SiC substrate. The pump absorption was supposed to decrease exponentially through 
the active region and the Bragg mirror; the pump beam transverse profile was top-hat. We have evaluated the average 
thermal resistance Rth of the ½ -VCSELs over the laser beam area, measured between the top surface of the Peltier cooler 
and  the  QWs.  The  values  of  Rth  are  given  relatively  to  the  incident  pump  power.  Assuming  an  internal  quantum 
efficiency  ηi  of  80%  for  the QWs  and  of 10%  for  the GaAs  in  the  Bragg  mirror,  50%  of  the  incident  pump  power is 
converted to heat.  

On the one hand, we used an analytical three-layer model (active region/susbtrate/copper block) in which the 
substrate  itself  is  perfectly  bonded  onto  an  infinite  copper  block  (thermal  conductivity  of  4  W/m/K)  [11].  The  active 
region  consists  of  the  QWs  and  the  Bragg  mirror  layers,  with  a  total  thickness  ev=5.45µm.  A  mean  value  of 
κv=32 W/m/K was considered as its thermal conductivity. We have evaluated that for pump beam waist radii larger than 
the  critical  value  rc=  ev  (κs/κv),  the  major  contribution  to  the  temperature  increase  in  the  QW  layers  arises  from  the 
substrate. Then the heat flow in the ½–VCSEL is purely 1D, and the temperature rise only depends on the pump power 
density. These critical pump radii are rc= 7.7 µm and 83.4 µm for the GaAs and SiC substrates respectively. On the other 
hand, the thermal resistance has been evaluated with a finite-element numerical simulation (FEMLAB). A 10-mm lateral 
width  of  the  sample  was  considered.  Furthermore,  a  50 µm-thick  heat-paste  layer  (thermal  conductivity  of  2W/K/m) 
embedded between the substrate and copper block and the substrate could be taken into account The thermal resistances 
evaluated  from  both  the  numerical  and  the  analytical  models  are  compared  in  Figure  3.  The  analytical  model,  which 
mainly  neglects  the  heat-paste  layer  contribution,  slightly  underestimates  the  thermal  resistance  from  2  to  60%  in  the 
range of pump radius investigated here (30-450µm). It is thus a simple and efficient tool for the evaluation of the thermal 
resistance of the structures.

These simulations have been compared to the experimental evaluation of the thermal resistance of the two samples under 
laser  operation  close  to  threshold,  through  the  measurement  of  the  emission  wavelength  shift  with  the  incident  pump 
power and the heatsink temperature. For a pump waist radius of 100 µm, a thermal resistance of 6 K/Winc was measured 
for the structure bonded onto SiC, which is in relatively good accordance with the theoretical value of 5.6 K/Winc. This 
value is much lower than the thermal resistance measured under the same experimental conditions for the structure on the 
GaAs  substrate,  which  was  about  50  K/Winc.  Finally,  the  temperature  at  the  top  surface  of  the  ½-VCSELs  has  been 
measured  under  cw  optical  pumping  in  the  spontaneous  emission  regime  (no  laser  cavity)  with  an  infrared  camera 
operating in the 8-12µm range [12]. The lateral resolution of the mapping was 60µm, thus only suited for large pump 
beam waists. With a maximum temperature rise limited to 15°C for a 4 W pump beam focused on a 250 µm radius waist, 
the structure bonded onto SiC obviously demonstrates the lower thermal resistance (figure 4). Furthermore these maps 
show the good homogeneity of our bonding process.

III. INFRARED LASER CHARACTERIZATION 

3.1 Experimental set-up 
The  VECSEL  system  was  set  up  in  a  simple  and  compact  cavity  configuration  as  it  is  shown  in  Figure 5.  The  half-
VCSEL was mounted onto a copper heatsink to control the temperature of the device with a Peltier module. The laser 
was  pumped  with  a  continuous  wave  (cw)  fiber-coupled  λp = 808  nm  laser  diode  delivering  up  to  7 W  focused  on 
approximately  a  100  µm  radius  spot  with  an  incidence  angle  of  20°.  The  external  cavity  was  simply  formed  by  the 
VCSEL and a concave dielectric mirror with a reflectivity of Roc= 98.8 % at λL=1010 nm and a curvature radius of 100 
mm. The overall cavity length was around Lc=95 mm, leading to a cavity Free-Spectral-Range (FSR) of ~ 5  pm.

3.2 High power laser characterization: experiment and theory 
In  the  compact  two-mirror  cavity  and  without  any  intracavity  element,  an  output  power  of  1.7 W  at  the  maximum 
incident  pump  power  of  7 W  was  obtained  with  the  ½  -  VCSEL  bonded  on  SiC  at  283  K.  On  the  contrary,  no  laser 
operation was achievable with the structure on GaAs in the same cavity and pump conditions, and the maximum output 
power  was  only  100  mW  for  a  pump  waist  radius  of  50  µm.  This  demonstrates  once  more  the  effectiveness  of  the 
bonding technique on a high conductivity substrate for high power laser emission. Further laser investigations will thus 
only be reported with the ½ - VCSEL bonded onto SiC: the incident pump power at threshold was 0.8 W in cw operation 
th=2.2kW/cm2, and the CW slope efficiency was about 32 %. 
at 283 K, corresponding to an incident pump density of Iinc
The laser oscillation occurs around 1009 nm at the maximum pump power, with a cw spectral bandwidth of nearly 2 nm. 
We believe that this linewidth is limited by the QW's gain jitter induced by the pump power fluctuations.  

These experimental results have been compared to a theoretical evaluation of the VECSEL behavior based on

(1200 cm-1)  and  the  Jtr  (50  A/cm2),  which  make  the  connection  between  the  maximal  material  gain  and  the  current 
density per QW, are deduced from reference 9 for InGaAs/GaAs quantum wells. The longitudinal confinement factor Γc 
is 2 and the intracavity losses Ti are evaluated to 0.2%. The external quantum efficiency ηe at the laser output, assuming 
a pump-to-laser beam recovering integral close to unity, is given by (Eq. 3). Finally, the evolution of the threshold with 
temperature  is  theoretically  taken  into  account  through  the  characteristic  temperature  T0,  evaluated  to  60  K  in  these 
experiments. Figure 6 shows the very good agreement between the theoretical evaluation of the output power with the 
incident pump power, and our experimental results. An actual output power limited to 1.8 W is predicted for an incident 
pump power of 7.9 W and a 100 µm radius pump waist.  

These simulations have been used to estimate the maximum output power which could be extracted from our ½-
VCSEL  at  T  =  283  K,  with  an  optimization  of  both  the  incident  pump  power  and  the  pump  beam  waist.  In  these 
calculations the thermal resistance of the structure was evaluated with a 50 µm-thick heatpaste layer between the copper 
heatsink  and  the  substrate  (see  figure  3).  Obviously  the  low  thermal  conductivity  of  GaAs  limits  the  available  laser 
power  to  0.1  W  (figure  6,  inset).  On  the  contrary  an  output  power  as  high  as  6.7 W  should  be  obtained  with  a  30  W 
incident pump beam focused onto a 260 µm radius waist with the structure bonded on SiC.

one bonded onto SiC ; the incident pump power is set for maximum laser emission of each structure; T 
= 10°C, output coupler T = 1.2%. 

3.3. Single-frequency laser operation  
The  insertion of  a  solid 50 µm-thick  low-finesse  etalon in  the  compact  cavity  set-up described  in  figure 5 results in  a 
narrow-line laser emission tunable from ~ 998 nm to ~ 1010 nm by rotating the etalon and changing the pump position 
on the ½ -VCSEL structure. The maximum output power was 1.3 W at 1006.5 nm for an incident pump power of 7 W; 
the  reduction  of  the  output  power  by  about  30  %  as  compared  to  the  previous  results  is  due  to  the  additional  losses 
introduced  by  the  solid  etalon.  On  the  entire  incident  pump  power  range  the  emission  wavelength  remains  strongly

Proceedings Photonics Europe Strasbourg 2006 

controlled  by  the  etalon  with  a  spectral  shift  less  than  0.2 nm.  The  beam  quality  factor  M2  relating  the  spatial  beam 
properties to an ideal Gaussian beam was about 1.3 at the highest pump power. The linear polarization of the laser beam 
was aligned along the [110] semiconductor crystal axis, due to a slight gain dichroism between [110] and [1-10] crystal 
axis. 

A  true  single-frequency  operation  was  obtained  at  1003  nm  for  an  output  power  limited  to  0.5  W  at  the 
maximum incident pump power. That further decrease of the output power can be mainly attributed to the alignments of 
the cavity and the etalon to force a stable single-frequency laser line. The single-frequency laser spectrum was analyzed 
with a 50 mm confocal scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer with a FSR of around 1.5 GHz (see inset in figure 7). The 
side-mode suppression ratio is at least 20 dB, but the scanning Fabry-Perot apparatus function limits the measurement of 
the laser linewidth. However in this configuration, the laser linewidth should be limited by acoustic and/or thermal noise 
at the kHz level [4,13]. No stabilization of the laser emission frequency has been carried out.

It  has  recently  been  demonstrated  both  theoretically  and  experimentally  that  a  single-frequency  operation  is 
achievable  in  short  cavity  (Lc  <  100  mm)  VECSEL  without  any  intracavity  filter,  thanks  to  their  ideal  multimode 
homogeneous gain and the fact that non-linear mode coupling is negligible [13,14]. Indeed, though at the very beginning 
of the laser operation several thousands of longitudinal cavity modes are amplified, the laser collapses to a single mode 
after  a  characteristic  time  tc.  But  the  emission  would  remain  multimode  if  any  process  (gain  or  mirror  jitter,  thermal 
fluctuations…) disturbs the laser dynamics on a time scale shorter than tc. The characteristic time tc necessary to achieve 
a single-mode laser operation after a strong perturbation arises (100% gain modulation e.g.) is equal to the time tg within 
which the non-stationary laser bandwidth ΔL, given by (Eq. 4), is equal to one FSR of the laser cavity:

In this equation, tg is the generation time elapsed since the beginning of the laser emission, γ0 is the broadband cavity loss 
rate (proportional to 1/Lc; γ0=22.1×106 s-1 in our operating conditions), and Γg,f is the gain or filter bandwidth, depending 
on the intracavity elements [15]. The single-mode characteristic time tc is plotted in figure 8 as a function of the cavity 
length, with (Γf = 1.1 nm FWHM – parabolic fit) and without (Γg = 34 nm) the 50-µm Fabry-Perot etalon inserted.

time; dot line #2: multimode pump fluctuations perturbation time. The top arrow shows the 
actual cavity length used in the experiment. 

 

In our experimental conditions, without the etalon filter inside the laser cavity, the laser emission was not single-mode 
and the cw (stationary) laser bandwidth ΔL covered about several hundreds cavity modes. From (Eq. 4) it corresponds to 
a generation time - the duration necessary for the laser spectrum to narrow into a single mode before a perturbation arises 
-  of  about  100 µs.  Since  this  value  is  one  order  of  magnitude  shorter  than  the  typical  characteristic  time  of  acoustic 
or/and thermal noise (in the millisecond range [3, 13]), we believe that the multimode nature of our fiber-coupled pump 
laser diode generates strong pump intensity fluctuations at a time scale shorter than 100 µs, which in turns destabilize the 
central wavelength of the gain spectrum and interrupt the spectral narrowing of the VECSEL. From the simulations in 
figure  8  it  is  obvious  that  even  our  low-finesse  etalon,  with  a  FSR  of  2  THz  (Δλ  ~  7  nm  @  1003  nm)  which  covers 
numerous  longitudinal  modes,  helps  to  reduce  the  characteristic  time  of  the  single-mode  operation  below  the  typical 
fluctuations time of the set-up induced by acoustic, thermal noise and/or pump-induced gain fluctuations. It allows thus 
to obtain a strong single-mode operation, as observed experimentally.

A  four-mirror  Z-cavity  with  a  total  length  of  around  630  mm  was  implemented  for  intracavity  second  harmonic 
generation at 501.7 nm (figure 9). Mirrors M1 and M2 had a radius of curvature of 200 mm, and a reflectivity > 99.98 % 
between 900-1100 nm. Mirror M3 was a 75 mm spherical mirror with a reflectivity > 99.9 % in the range 650-1100 nm. 
The laser cavity has two different outputs with similar powers at 501.7 nm because of the high transmission of all the 
mirrors in the visible range. A type-I temperature-tuned non-critical phase-matching KNbO3 crystal was placed inside an 
oven  at  a  temperature  of  75.6  °C.  The  nonlinear  crystal  was  b-cut,  9.5  mm-long  and  anti-reflection  coated  for  both 
fundamental  and  second harmonic  wavelengths. The waist  radius  inside  the  KNbO3 crystal  was  evaluated  to  about  90

µm. A Lyot filter and a 100 µm-thick FP etalon were also inserted not only to select the desire emission wavelength, but 
also to obtain a stable single frequency operation at both wavelengths 1003.4 nm and 501.7 nm, which was impossible to 
achieve without the etalon. The crystal was oriented such as the intracavity fundamental laser beam at 1003.4 nm was 
polarized along the a-axis of the non-linear crystal, while the second harmonic generated beam was polarized along the 
c-axis.

Figure  10  represents  the  single-frequency  output  power  of  the  green-blue  emission  as  function  of  the  incident  pump 
power at 808 nm. A total maximum cw output power of 62 mW at 501.7 nm in two beams for a 6.5 W pump power was 
obtained.  The  infrared  intracavity  power  was  estimated  to  be  about  10  W,  leading  to  a  second  harmonic  generation 
conversion efficiency of only 0.6 %. This low conversion efficiency can be attributed to the constraints imposed by the 
oven dimensions, which lead to a rather large waist inside the crystal and a confocal parameter much longer (~ 44 mm) 
than the crystal length [15]. Moreover, the residual losses introduced by the intracavity elements and the mirrors reduce 
the  available  infrared  laser  power.  The  frequency  spectrum  of  the  fundamental  infrared  laser  beam  was  also  analysed 
with  the  same  Fabry-Perot  interferometer  as  previously.  The  inset  of  figure  10  shows  a  typical  scanning  trace,  which 
demonstrates  the  single-frequency  operation  of  the  laser.  Though  these  results  are  very  preliminary  and  the  second 
harmonic generation process is not yet fully optimized as explained, the reached single frequency output power at 501.7 
nm is similar to the one obtained with an Yb-doped laser crystal and a KNbO3 frequency-doubling crystal by Jacquemet 
et  al.  [16],  with  the  advantage  of  a  simpler  design  of  the  laser  cavity.  Therefore,  considering  these  as  previous 
measurements, future prospects focused on the enhancement of the SHG, on the stabilization of the laser emission and on 
the change of the doubling crystal are going to be carried out.

VII. CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, in this work the highest output power in a single-frequency operation of a diode-pumped VECSEL has 
been  reported.  Thanks  to  an  original  technique  based  on  the  AuIn2  solid  liquid  inter  diffusion  bonding,  the  active 
structure  has  been  bonded  on  a  SiC  substrate  exhibiting  a  low  thermal  impedance.  The  AuIn2  bonding  allows  further 
processing steps at elevated temperatures and does not induce any strain-related degradation of the optical properties of 
the  structure.  We  then  obtained  a  maximum  output  power  of  1.7 W  in  a  simple  and  compact  plano-concave  cavity, 
limited  by  the available  incident  pump  power.  The  improvement  of  the thermal  dissipation from  the  active region has 
been  experimentally  checked  with  both  laser  characterizations  and  temperature  mappings  under  high  power  optical 
pumping. It was theoretically explained through the evaluation of the thermal resistance of the ½ -VCSEL, which allows 
us to predict the conditions for optimal laser operation.  

With  the  insertion  of  only  a  solid  Fabry-Perot  etalon  it  has  been  possible  to  pick  the  emission  wavelength  at 
1003 nm and to force a single-frequency operation with up to 500 mW of output power. A simple model has been used to 
explain  that  laser  emission  on  a  single  longitudinal  mode  is  possible  even  with  our  low  finesse  and  large  FSR  solid 
etalon. We further demonstrate that, due to the multimode nature of the optical pump source used, an intracavity filter is 
necessary to develop high power single-frequency VECSEL systems. 

Finally,  motivated  by  the  interest  of  blue-green  single-frequency  emission  around  501.7  nm  for  metrological 
applications  such  as  iodine-based  laser  stabilization,  second  harmonic  generation  had  been  performed  with  a  KNbO3 
nonlinear crystal. A maximum visible power of 62 mW has been generated in a four-mirror Z-cavity. These results can 
be compared to those obtained with bulk ytterbium-doped crystals in a more complicated architecture.

Abstract. This work is devoted to the study of solar light that experiences single and multiple scattering in the atmos-
phere at the twilight time. The work is based on polarimetric observations of the twilight sky that were conducted in
1997 and 2000 for different color bands. Basing on the results of observations, the contribution of single-scattered light
depending on the wavelength for the light stage of twilight is obtained. The correlation of color and polarization prop-
erties of the twilight sky is investigated with an account of multiple scattering.

1. INTRODUCTION

Taking account of solar light that experiences multiple
scattering in the Earth(cid:146)s atmosphere is one of the basic
problems in the study of the atmosphere by photomet-
ric  observations  of  the  twilight  sky.  As  early  as  1923,
V.G. Fesenkov called attention to the essential contri-
bution of multiple scattering in his first work devoted to
the analysis of twilight phenomena [1]. However, as it
was correctly noted by G.V. Rozenberg [2], the extreme
complexity of constructing a theory of multiple scatter-
ing forced many authors to disregard this effect or intro-
duce various, sometimes fairly crude assumptions con-
cerning its properties. A comparative analysis of a great
number  of  works  made  by  Rozenberg  [2]  revealed  an
extremely wide range of results, from the possibility of
completely neglecting multiple scattering to its essential
predominance  over  single-scattered  light.  Sufficient
errors of defined ratio of single and multiple scattering
often  lead  to  wrong  explanations  of  well-known
observed  color  and  polarization  properties  of  the  twi-
light  sky.  Obviously,  the  ratio  of  single-  to  multiple-
scattered  light  directly  determines  the  efficiency  and
work range of the twilight method of atmospheric study,
in  which  the  multiple  scattering  is  a  peculiar  kind  of
(cid:147)noise(cid:148) that must be subtracted from the total sky back-
ground brightness. This twilight method is effective for
investigations of lower atmosphere vertical profile, espe-
cially atmospheric ozone and aerosol properties.

The main object of investigation of this work is the
behavior  of  the  ratio  of  single  and  multiple  scattered
light  during  the  twilight  period  and  its  relation  with
observed photometric and polarimetric properties of the
twilight sky. The work is based on the improved method
of  calculation  of  this  ratio  from  the  observational
polarimetric data. 

2.  PROPERTIES  OF  SINGLE  AND  MULTIPLE
SCATTERING

Let us consider the scheme of formation of single- and
multiple-scattered light at the twilight time and its fun-
damental  properties.  We  shall  be  only  interested  in
points  in  the  solar  vertical.  The  brightnesses  of  these
two fractions of twilight sky background are denoted by
J and j, respectively. The scheme of appearance of both
components at the sunrise and sunset times is shown in
Figure 1. The brightness of the single-scattered compo-
nent for a fixed wavelength is given by the integral

where integration is performed over HL, the minimum
altitude of the solar ray above the Earth(cid:146)s surface; HSC
is  the  altitude  of  the  point  of  light  scattering;  z is  the
zenith distance for an observed point of the sky (which
is positive in the glow region and negative in the oppo-
site region of the sky); h is the depth of the sun under
horizon; n is the number density of particles at the alti-
tude HSC; D is the scattering function (indicatrix);  g
is
the  scattering  angle;  t 1 and  t 2 are  the  optical  depths
along the ray paths before and after the scattering event,
respectively. The quantity t 2, with a small correction, is
equal  to  the  vertical  optical  depth  of  the  atmosphere
multiplied by sec z.

The (cid:147)twilight ray(cid:148) model is very convenient in some
cases. The essence of this model is that solar rays pass-
ing  near  the  Earth(cid:146)s  surface  experience  strong  absorp-
tion,  while  rays  passing  at  great  heights  are  scattered
very  weakly  in  the  upper,  rarefied  atmospheric  layers.
As a result, the main part of the single scattered com-
ponent  is  formed  in  the  so-called  (cid:147)twilight  layer(cid:148),
which has a comparatively small thickness that does not
sufficiently  depend  on  the  depth  of  the  sun  under  the
horizon  and  on  the  zenith  distance  of  the  observed
point  (except  the  case  of  large  l and  h<0,  when  the
(cid:147)twilight layer(cid:148) grazes lowest layers of the atmosphere
and even the surface of the Earth). The minimum alti-
tude of the twilight layer above the ground grows com-
paratively  slow  with  the  sun(cid:146)s  depth.  Taking  this  fact

into account, the integral in formula (1) can be replaced
by the integrand at a certain point HL0(h) multiplied by
the  effective  thickness  of  the  layer,  which  can  be
included in the constant. In this case, the effective scat-
tering  altitude  HSC0(z,h) will  correspond  to  every
observed point.

This  method  has  already  been  used  repeatedly,  for
example,  by  N.B.  Divari  [3],  but  in  contrast  to  his
work,  we  use  the  value  of  HL0 corresponding  to  the
average  contribution  to  the  integral  instead  of  the  HL0
value corresponding to the maximum of the integrand.
Owing to asymmetry of the twilight layer, these values
differ by several kilometers.

Since  the  effective  ray  paths  go  at  high  altitudes
(above 10 km), we can disregard refraction. Let us con-
sider in greater detail the case h=0 (sun at the horizon).
In this case (if the points close to the horizon are dis-
regarded) HSC0=HL0, and equation (1) takes the simpli-
fied form

It should be noted that for h>0, the altitude of the
twilight  layer  increases,  HSC0(z) became  z-dependent,
and, as the sun descends under the horizon, this depen-
dence  becomes  progressively  steeper:  the  scattering  in
the  glow  region  occurs  in  a  lower  place  than  in  the
opposite part of the sky.

We denote by J^ (J||) the brightness of the single-scat-
tered component in the polarization plane perpendicu-
lar  (parallel)  to  the  scattering  plane.  It  is  evident  that
equations  (1)  and  (2)  also  holds  for  these  quantities,
with substitutions of the polarization indicatrices D^ and
D||, respectively. The quantities j^ and j|| are introduced
in a similar manner.

Instead  of  polarization  coefficient  we  shall  use  in
this work a more suitable quantity: the polarization ratio
K, which is equal to the ratio of the sky brightnesses for
polarization directions parallel and perpendicular to the
scattering  plane.  The  degree  of  polarization  p is  con-
nected with K by simple relation p=(1(cid:150)K)/(1+K). For
nonpolarized light K is obviously equal to unity.

The  scattering  indicatrices  D^

,|| are  the  sum  of  air
(Rayleigh) and aerosol indicatrices. From the Kabann-
Rayleigh  scattering  matrix  [2],  one  can  readily  obtain
(accurate to constant) the air scattering indicatrices for
the case of unpolarized outer emission:

(3),

where  a
is  1/2  of  the  depolarization  parameter  in  the
Kabann-Rayleigh  matrix.  In  accordance  with  [2],  we
assume  a =0.03.  As  for  aerosol  indicatrices,  it  is  only
known that, in contrast to the air indicatrices, they are
asymmetric with respect to g =90(cid:176) , exhibiting an excess
at small scattering angles.

Multiple scattering (as well as the scattering of light
reflected from the Earth(cid:146)s surface), like single scattering,
also  take  place  in  a  certain  layer,  located,  however,  at
much low altitudes, in the near-Earth atmospheric lay-
ers. Fesenkov [4] even called this component the (cid:147)tro-
pospheric(cid:148) one. Its mean altitude varies at an extremely
slow  rate  with  the  depth  of  the  sun  under  horizon.
Variation  with  zenith  distance  of  the  observed  point  is

also  insignificant.  These  facts  form  the  basis  for  the
assumption (which has been used repeatedly [4,5]) that
the logarithmic derivatives at the symmetric points of the
solar vertical for each h value are equal to each other:

d

)

ln ( ,
j z h
dh

=

d

ln (

(4).

However,  as  mean  altitude  of  multiple  scattering  does
vary,  the  equality  cannot  be  integrated  over  a  wide
range  of  the  sun(cid:146)s  depths  under  the  horizon  (which  is
actually done in [5]), as will be shown below.

The  effects  related  to  the  multiple  scattering  alti-
tudes  will  disappear  if  we  write  equation  (4)  for  two
polarization directions and subtract one equation from
another. We can then integrate the resulting equation,
which will lead us to an expression relating the polar-
ization ratios q of multiple scattering at the symmetric
points of the solar vertical:

q z h

=

(5).

As we shall see later, the parameter q
for any z is close
to unity, and equation (5) describes the property of sym-
metry of multiple scattering polarization, which is quite
natural if we take into account the similar polarization
properties of the scattering of light at adjacent angles.

3.  OBSERVATIONS  AND  PROPERTIES  OF  THE
TWILIGHT SKY

First session of polarimetric observations of the twilight
sky background was held in July (cid:151) August 1997 at the
Astronomical  Observatory  of  Odessa  University
(Ukraine).  The  sky  brightness  and  polarization  were
measured in a wide range of the sun(cid:146)s depth under the
horizon: from (cid:150)2(cid:176)
(sun above the horizon) to 20(cid:176) . The
measurements were made with an autoscanning twilight
photometer  [6]  in  the  solar  vertical  in  the  range  of
zenith distances from (cid:150)70(cid:176)
to +70(cid:176) . The wavelength of
measurements  (356  nm)  does  not  fall  in  the  region  of
sufficient  selective  absorption  of  atmosphere  gases,
including  ozone.  The  principal  light  absorption  and
scattering  mechanism  at  this  wavelength  is  Rayleigh
scattering,  to  which  scattering  by  particles  of  atmos-
pheric aerosol may be added.

Second  session  of  observations  was  conducted  in
July  (cid:151)  August  2000  at  South  Laboratory  of  Moscow
Sternberg  Astronomical  Institute  (Crimea,  Ukraine).
Twilight sky background was registered by ST-6 CCD-
camera  with  short-focus  lens  and  polaroid.  Maximum
zenith  distance  was  reaching  about  15(cid:176) .  Exact  axis
direction and field of view were determined by the stars
position  at  the  nighttime  images.  At  different  dates
observations  were  carried  out  in  U,  B,  V  and  R  color
bands  (with  effective  wavelengths  about  360,  440,  550
and  700  nm,  respectively),  and  at  several  evenings  of
August  2000  simultaneous  observations  in  V  and  R
bands were made. Effective wavelength of U band was
near  to  first  session  observations  wavelength.  V  and  R
bands,  especially  first  one,  fall  into  the  region  of
Chappuis  lines  of  ozone  absorption.  These  lines  are
quite  weak,  but  may  have  sufficient  influence  on  e(cid:150)t 1
term in formulae (1) and (2) [7].

Figure 2 shows the dependencies of zenith polariza-
tion  ratio  K by  solar  depth  under  horizon  h for  some
observation dates and colors. We can see that behavior
of K is principally the same for different wavelengths. At

the  sunset  (or  sunrise)  polarization  ratio  is  changing
quite slowly and at h>4-5(cid:176)
fast increasing (polarization
weakening)  starts.  Here  we  should  notice  that  at  the
same depths of the sun the behavior of twilight sky color
is  changing  too,  as  we  can  see  in  Figure  3,  slow  red-
dening  of  the  sky  is  replacing  by  its  fast  bluening  [7].
These two well-known phenomena were repeatedly and
hardly  tried  to  explain  as  only  single-scattered  light
effects [2], and in [8] the sky bluening was related with
Chappuis  ozone  absorption,  although  we  can  observe

this  phenomenon  even  at  the  wavelengths  outside  the
Chappius lines. As we shall see below, color and polar-
ization  changes  have  the  common  nature  and  can  be
easily explained if we take the multiple scattering effects
into account.

With the increasing of wavelength from U to V band
the polarization ratio is decreasing (polarization getting
stronger) in spite of the fact that depolarizing influence
of  aerosol  scattering  should  rise  at  larger  wavelengths.
Polarization ratio in R band is near to one in V for the

same observation day, as we can see in the Figure 2. As
we may expect from this and shall see below, only in R
band the influence of aerosol scattering is sufficient (we
should  note  that  observations  were  carried  out  only  at
good weather conditions), and at short wavelengths sin-
gle aerosol scattering (at least for twilight ray altitudes
corresponding to h=0) is small.

Last fact can be confirmed by the Figure 4, where

is shown for sunset moment of July, 31th, 1997, 356 nm.
Function f(z) was  calculated  for  this  wavelength  based
on  vertical  optical  depth  measured  by  Bouguer(cid:146)s
method for this date. We can see that this dependence
is  virtually  symmetric  with  respect  to  the  point  z=0.
Such  situation  is  the  same  to  other  1997  short-wave-
length  observation  dates.  Since  the  multiple  scattered
component cannot have an essential excess in the anti-

solar vertical, we can conclude that the function D near
the altitude HL0 for l =356 nm and h=0 turns out to be
symmetric and, therefore, influence of aerosol scatter-
ing at this case is small.

Figure 5 shows the polarization ratio of the twilight
sky K for different zenith distances as a function of  h.
Even  these  dependencies  enable  us,  in  principle,  to
assume  at  which  depths  of  the  sun  under  horizon  the
single  scattering  is  completely  lost  against  the  back-
ground of the multiple scattering. This occurs at h» 10(cid:176) ,
because  at  greater  depths  the  polarization  ratios  the
symmetric points of the solar vertical become identical;
i.e.  property  (5)  with  q =1,  expected  for  multiple  scat-
tering, holds. The phenomenon of inverse polarization
(K>1) of the sky away from zenith is noteworthy. The
reasons for its appearance will be discussed below.

At h<10(cid:176) sufficient asymmetry of polarization in the
solar vertical appears, and sky background in the glow
region is polarized stronger (K is less) than in the oppo-
site one. As we will see below, it is related with appear-
ance  of  strongly polarized  single  scattering  component
with  an  excess  in  the  glow  region  due  to  variance  of
effective scattering heights.

The  asymmetry  of  the  single  scattering  relatively
multiple one disappears near h=0 (in the case of weak
aerosol scattering). At these values of h we can see than
K is  increasing  with  h for  the  points  with  z<0 and
decreasing for z>0. This effect is related with a change
of single scattering polarization due to change in angle
of scattering, because polarization of the Rayleigh scat-
tering  reaches  its  maximum  at  g =90(cid:176) ,  which  is  corre-
sponding  to  z=0 for  h=0.  The  same  phenomenon  is
clearly visible in the Figure 6, where the dependence of
zenith  distance of  maximum  polarization  point on the
solar  depth  under  horizon  is  shown  for  simultaneous
observation  at  V  and  R  color  bands  in  the  evening  of
August, 6th, 2000. We can see that at small values of h
this point is following the setting sun, but the velocity

of such motion is less than in the case of pure Rayleigh
single  scattering  (dashed  line  in  the  Figure  6).  And  at
h>5(cid:176) (simultaneously with the polarization decrease and
bluening  of  the  sky)  this  point  turns  around  to  the
zenith  that  can  be  explained  only  by  domination  of
multiple scattering.

The  effect  of  polarization  changes  near  the  zenith
point  will  be  the  basic  for  the  method  of  single  and
multiple  scattering  separation  that  will  be  suggested  in
the next part of this work.

4. SEPARATION METHOD

Let  us  consider  the  case z=h=0 and  in  the  case  when
the  influence  of  single  aerosol  scattering  is  small  rela-
tively  single  Rayleigh  scattering.  Let  A be  fraction  of
single scattered light in the total sky brightness for the
perpendicular  polarization  direction,  and  Q and  q be
the polarization ratios for single-scattered and multiple-
scattered  light,  respectively.  It  can  be  shown  that  the
total polarization ratio is

We  make  the  mixed  derivative  of  K with  respect  to  z
and h and express it in terms of the derivatives of A, Q

Since  g =90(cid:176) (cid:150)z at  h=0,  the  quantity  dQ/dz  (z=h=0)
vanishes. It follows from (5), with allowing for q =1 that
dq/dz=0 for any h. On the other hand, the ratio I^ /f at
h=0 has a minimum at the zenith; therefore, taking in
account the constant value of J^ /f [as follows from for-
mula  (3)]  we  have  d(j^ /f)/dz=0 and,  hence,  dA/dz  =0
for z=h=0. As a result, we obtain

The mixed derivative in first term can be calculated by
the direct substitution of (3) (on account of g =90(cid:176) (cid:150)z+h).
It turns out to be equal to (cid:150)2/(1+a ). The second term
in the right side of equation (9) also contained a mixed
derivative that can be transformed as follows:

phere  at  altitudes  between  10  and  30  km  is  virtually
isothermal, with a temperature T=220K, and substitut-
ing the corresponding Boltzmann distribution function

Here, the quantity of K and its mixed derivative at the
point z=h=0 are determined from the observations. The
resulting value is positive because the mixed derivative
of K is less than zero. Basing on this value, we can cal-
culate the ratio of single and multiple scattered light at
the  moment  h=0 for  any  polarization  direction  and
amounts of z where measurements were made, by using
formulae (2) and (3). And certainly, given the altitude
atmospheric model, we can expand the calculations of
A for any amount of h in observed range by single scat-
tering  calculation,  but  in  this  case  we  shall  calculate
only Rayleigh fraction of single scattering without tak-
ing  into  account  the  upper  atmospheric  aerosol  the
influence of which at larger z can be sufficient (but, as
we shall see below, it did not exceed several dozens of
percent at 356 nm for 1997 observation dates).

5. RESULTS

The  method  discussed  above  gives  the  exact  values  of
single- to multiple-scattered light ratio only if the influ-
ence  of  single  aerosol  scattering  at  the  moment  h=0
(what is corresponding to aerosol scattering at altitudes
about 15-25 km) is insufficient. One can expect that it
will be true at the clear sky at short wavelengths but this
rule should be broken at larger ones. As we saw above,
the aerosol scattering was insufficient for the most part
of 1997 observations at 356 nm. To check this assump-
tion and formula (13) correctness for all other observa-
tions  at  different  wavelengths  we  build  the  diagram  of
two measured quantities which are included to this for-
mula, K and its mixed derivative with respect to z and
h  (z=h=0),  for  all  observations  when  these  quantities
were  measured  with  good  accuracy.  This  diagram  is
shown in the Figure 7, the cross symbol in this diagram

We can see that most part of points corresponding to
the 1997 observations at 356 nm and also most part of
points corresponding to the 2000 observations in U, B
and  V  bands  are  situated  near  the  straight  line  passing
also  near  the  point  of  clear  Rayleigh  single  scattering.
But  most  part  of  points  corresponding  to  the  observa-
tions in R band, where aerosol influence is expected to
be  most  sufficient,  deflect  from  this  line  in  the  same
direction and only one R band point (evening of August,
4th,  2000)  is  situated  near  the  line.  Here  we  should
notice that in that evening the weather conditions were
the best and the sky polarization was the strongest for all
V and R bands observation dates.

Taking these facts into account we may assume that
single  aerosol  scattering  at  the  sunrise  and  sunset  was
insufficient  for  the  most  part  of  356  nm,  U,  B  and  V
observations,  with  the  exception  of  morning  of  July,
30th,  1997  (356  nm)  and  morning  of  the  same  date  in
2000 (B band). Small influence of aerosol was also pos-
sible  in  the  mornings  of  July,  28th,  2000  (B  band)  and
August,  5th-7th,  2000  (V  band).  All  these  points  deflect
from the line at the same direction as the points of R-
band observations, where the aerosol influence is suffi-
cient. It is interesting to notice that single aerosol scat-
tering at 356 nm, U, B and V bands was seen only in
morning twilight observations.

Confirming the fact above, we should add that linear
correlation between the values of K and its mixed deriv-
ative in the case of lack of single aerosol scattering quite
naturally results from (7) and (13) with account of con-
stant value of a , small value of second item (relatively
to the first one) in the brackets of formula (13) and weak
dependence of quantity (Q(cid:150)q) on the wavelength what
is expected in the case of Rayleigh scattering.

We  should  not  conclude  that  atmosphere  aerosol
does not display itself at clear twilight sky in the blue-
green part of spectrum. We can speak only about small
value of its scattering coefficient relatively Rayleigh one
during  the  most  part  of  observation  dates  and  only  at
scattering  angles  about  90(cid:176)
for  these  wavelengths  and
effective  scattering  altitudes  for  the  sunrise  and  sunset
time.  For  our  color  bands  these  altitudes  are  about 
15-25 km. Naturally, the influence of aerosol scattering
sufficiently  increases  in  R  band  where  the  ratio  of
aerosol  and  Rayleigh  scattering  coefficients  increases
and the effective scattering takes place at the lower alti-
tudes with large density of aerosol particles.

However, our conclusion is enough for possibility to
calculate the contribution of single scattering at z=h=0
by formula (13) in the most part of our observations at
356 nm and in U, B and V bands. The quantity HL0 was
calculated  based  on  the  gas  atmosphere  model  with
temperature distribution typical for the season and lati-
tude of observations (it is shown in Figure 8). Its value
turned  out  to  be  24.6  km  for  356  nm,  24.0,  18.9  and
13.4 km for U, B and V bands, respectively, in the last
case  the  ozone  Chappuis  absorption  was  taken  into
account.

Table 1. The single scattering contribution at z=h=0 for 1997 and 2000 observation dates.

single aerosol scattering. Last column of the table con-
tains  relative  error  of  mixed  derivative  of  K that  is
almost coincides with relative errors of A, a, and AT.

As we can see from the table, at z=h=0 single scat-
tering contains less than the half of total sky background
brightness in a violet part of spectrum but with increase
of wavelength its contribution becomes more sufficient
and can reach 70% in a green-yellow part of spectrum.
Last result is quite near to theoretical estimations of this
value  [2],  but  does  not  reach  them.  We  can  conclude
that multiple scattered component of the twilight sky is
(cid:147)more blue(cid:148) than single scattered one that is quite nat-
ural  if  we  take  into  account  the  increase  of  scattering
coefficient at the short wavelengths.

The  contribution  of  single  scattering  was  changing
from  day  to  day,  notice  its  sufficient  decrease  in  the
evenings of July, 30th and 31th, 2000. One of the possi-
ble explanations of this phenomenon is so-called (cid:147)bar-
rier effect(cid:148) which was considered in [2] and displayed
in  [7]  as  sufficient  decrease  of  sky  brightness  in  long-
wave  part  of  spectrum  which  was  not  related  with
atmosphere conditions changes directly at the observa-
tion point. This lead to the change of sky color clearly
visible for two lowest curves in Figure 3. The scheme of
this effect is shown in Figure 9. If the barriers for light
propagation (clouds) appear at the direction of the set-
ting  sun,  it  can  sufficiently  decrease  the  brightness  of
single-scattered  light,  especially  at  long-wave  part  of
spectrum, where the (cid:147)twilight ray(cid:148) is propagating at low
altitudes.  The  influence  of  the  barrier  on  the  multiple
scattered component is not so sufficient, and its contri-
bution increases. This picture is also confirmed by the
clouds  appeared  at  the  glow  region  after  the  sunset  in
these two evenings.

Another  one  possible  reason  for  changes  of  single-
and multiple-scattered light ratio is the changes of lower
tropospheric aerosol that is not emitted by the sun and
does not form the single scattered light but have influ-
ence on multiple scattering and absorbs all components
of twilight sky background.

The picture in the R color band is more complicat-
ed,  as  it  was  mentioned  above.  Strong  influence  of
atmospheric aerosol for most part of observations moves
the points down and right in the Figure 7. The module
of mixed derivative of K sufficiently increases, although
the value of K itself only slightly differs from that one
in the V color band. Formal substitution of the obtained
parameters into formula (13) in some cases leads to the
value of A exceeding the unity, that is obviously unreal
(these cases are corresponded by the dashes in Table 1).
The reasons of K mixed derivative module increase
can be related with the polarization properties of aerosol
scattering  and  with  fast  decrease  of  aerosol  scattering
coefficient  with  the  altitude,  that  agrees  with  its  weak
influence  at  larger  altitudes  that  are  effective  for  scat-
tering in the V band. This effect would mean decrease

of Hatm, increase of the second item module in formu-
lae (9) and (13) and, thus, increase of K mixed deriva-
tive module.

All these reasons do not allow us to use the formu-
la (13) to estimate the contribution of single scattering
for the R color band in general. However, approximate
estimations can be made for the evening of August, 4th,
2000,  when  the  influence  of  aerosol  was  quite  weak.
Assuming HL0=9.8 km (from the gas atmosphere model),
we obtain the value of A given in Table 1. We can see
that the contribution of single scattering continue to rise
with the increase of wavelength from V to R band.

Having obtained the contribution of single scattering
at  the  point  z=h=0 we  can  estimate  it  for  the  other
cases  in  the  observations  range.  Figure  10  shows  the
dependence of this value on z at h=0 for two polariza-
tion  directions  for  the  evening  of  July,  31th,  1997 
(356  nm).  Zenith  minimum  for  parallel  polarization
direction  appears  due  to  the  strong  polarization  of
Rayleigh scattering at g =90(cid:176) .

As  it  was  mentioned  above,  in  the  case  of h>0 we
can calculate only Rayleigh fraction of single scattering,
assuming the altitude temperature distribution shown in
Figure 8 (the value of temperature of mesospheric min-
imum region, 80 km, is taken from [9]). The result of
calculations  for  the  same  evening  are  shown  in  the
Figure 11. An interesting fact is worthy of note: at the
bright period of twilight, the contribution of single scat-
tering slightly increases with the sun(cid:146)s depth under the
horizon  for  some  zenith  distances.  But  at  h>5(cid:176)
this
value rapidly decreases, especially in the opposite to the
glow sky region, where the effective scattering altitude
rises faster than in the glow region of the twilight sky.
These  two  twilight  stages  were  called  in  [2]  (cid:147)half-twi-
light(cid:148) and (cid:147)total twilight(cid:148).

Let  us  return  to  the  formula  (4)  for  multiple  scat-
tering.  As  it  was  mentioned  above,  this  is  only  an
approximate  formula,  and  its  integration  gives  rise  to
perceptible errors. Nevertheless, we can rewrite (4) as

The upper curve in Figure 12 shows this dependence
for the evening of July, 31th, 1997 (356 nm) and polar-
ization direction perpendicular to the scattering plane,
z=60(cid:176) .  It  is  apparent  that  for  h=6(cid:176)
the  growth  of  R0
changes to a decrease and at h=10(cid:176) , the function R0(h)
reaches a plateau, where its value is slightly higher than
the value at h=0. Taking into account the properties of
functions  R(h) and  r(h),  this  points  unambiguously  to
the fact that multiple scattering is completely dominant
for  z=60(cid:176) (in  the  glow  region)  at  h>10(cid:176) .  Correspond-
ingly,  this  situation  occurs  earlier  at  the  zenith  region
(as  it  visible  in  the  Figure  7,  for  example)  and  much
earlier  (cid:151)  on  the  opposite  to  the  glow  side  of  the  sky.
The  role  of  single  scattering  becomes  disappearingly
small at effective scattering altitudes of 100-120 km.

To  estimate  the  possible  aerosol  scattering  coeffi-
cient at high altitudes (corresponding to h>0(cid:176) ), we plot
a  similar  dependence  after  subtracting  the  Rayleigh
component  calculated  above  from  the  total  sky  back-
ground (lower curve in the same figure). At this case we
shall  also  find  a  peak  at  h=6(cid:176) ,  though  with  smaller
height. This gives evidence of the presence of (cid:147)nonsub-
tracted(cid:148)  single-scattered  light  (obviously  scattered  by
aerosol particles). But comparing the picks magnitudes
we  can  conclude  that  aerosol  single  scattered  compo-

nent  does  not  exceed  several  dozens  of  percents  of
Rayleigh one (at least for this observation date). Thus,
graphs presented in Figure 11, enable us to estimate the
role of single scattering in general.

To summarize the review of observational data, we
show in Figure 13 the polarization ratios q for multiple-
scattered light as a function of z for h=0(cid:176) and h=12(cid:176) for
the same observation date (evening of July, 31th, 1997,
356 nm). These curves, differing a bit from each other,
satisfy equation (5) with q =1 with good accuracy, and
agree reasonably with the model curve constructed for
double  scattering  under  the  assumption  that  the  sec-
ondary light source is a thin glowing semicircle with a
gradual fall of intensity from the center (above the sun)
toward  the  edges.  The  multiple  scattering  becomes
unpolarized  at  zenith  distances  about  50(cid:176) ,  and  these
(cid:147)neutral points(cid:148) of multiple scattering, as it is visible in
the figure, are practically immovable during the twilight
period!  So,  the  motion  of  (cid:147)neutral  points(cid:148)  for  total
background investigated in a large number of papers [2]
can be considered simply as the reflection of single- to
multiple-scattering ratio change.

At the zenith distances more than 50(cid:176) , the (cid:147)inverse
polarization(cid:148) effect takes place (j||>j^ ), which is caused
by the scattering of light coming from the side (relative
to  the  solar  vertical)  regions  of  the  sky  sphere.  This
effect,  such  as  the  effect  of  (cid:147)neutral  points(cid:148)  motion
completely described by the influence of multiple scat-
tering and do not related with atmospheric aerosol as it
was assumed in [2].

6. DISCUSSION

The main result of this work is the estimate of the frac-
tion of multiple-scattered light in the total background
of the twilight sky for various wavelengths, depths of the
sun under horizon and zenith distances of the sky point
in the solar vertical. For most part of 1997 observations
at 356 nm and 2000 observations in U, B and V color
bands the influence of aerosol scattering had turned out
to  be  insufficient  (except  a  little  number  of  morning
observations  only)  that  gave  us  the  possibility  of  exact
estimation of the single scattering contribution. In the R
color  band  the  aerosol  scattering  becomes  more  suffi-
cient,  but  the  polarization  is  even  stronger  than  in  V
band,  that  points  to  the  strong  polarization  of  aerosol
scattering. The R band data also shows that aerosol scat-
tering coefficient is rapidly decreasing with the altitude.

twilight sky background at the zenith at sunrise or sun-

set  moment  is  equal  to  only  about  40%  for  the  violet
rays, but increases to 60% in blue part of spectrum and
sometimes reaches 70% for visible one. Strong aerosol
influence does not allow to estimate this value for red
part of spectrum, but it is expected to be not less than
80%. Such wavelength dependence shows that multiple
scattered  light  has  the  surplus  in  short-wave  part  of
spectrum  relatively  single-scattered  one.  Relative  weak
wavelength dependence between B and V bands is pos-
sibly owing to sufficient Chappuis ozone absorption of
single scattered light in V band.

This ratio remains almost constant until the depth of
the sun under horizon about 4-5(cid:176) , then the role of sin-
gle scattering rapidly decreases, which is showed by the
return  of  maximum  polarization  point  to  the  zenith
(Figure  7)  and  weakening  of  glow  surplus  of  the  sky
brightness  (Figure  12).  At h about  10(cid:176)
single-scattered
light  completely  disappears  on  the  multiple-scattered
background.

The  fraction  of  multiple  scattering,  especially  at
large  values  of  h,  turned  out  to  be  much  higher  than
most of existing estimates [2]. The essence of the prob-
lem is the underestimation of the scattering of third and
higher orders in theoretical works. The mere fact of the
predominance of multiple scattering even during bright
twilight period suggests the essential role of high-order
scattering. This fact can also be the reason of incorrect
dependence  of  multiple-scattered  light  on  the  wave-
length obtained in [2,10].

G.V. Rozenberg(cid:146)s book [2] also contains a reference
to another work devoted to multiple scattering and pub-
lished as early as the 1930th [11]. The author, Hulburt,
attempted to estimate the brightness of multiple scatter-
ing at the zenith by representing it as the product of air
density at altitudes from 15 to 40 km and the sky bright-
ness measured in the glow region. Despite some inac-
curacies committed in this work and noticed later [2],
the  idea  by  itself  was  correct,  because  method  was
designed to take scattering of all orders into account. It
is quite logical that Hulburt came to the right conclu-

sion that at h=10(cid:176) , single scattering is lost on the back-
ground of multiple scattering. It is the conclusion that
has  become  the  object  of  strong  criticism  in  [2]  and
many other works based on theoretical estimates of the
contribution of multiple scattering.

We should also mention the method of separation of
single- and multiple-scattering light components that is
being  developed  at  the  Astronomical  Observatory  at
Odessa  University  (its  basic  principles  are  described
in [5]). The essence of this method is an extrapolation
of  the  empirical  property  of  multiple  scattering  (the
constancy of the logarithmic derivative of its brightness
with respect to h), which was revealed in the region of
large h to the region of small h. The method is attrac-
tive  in  its  simplicity,  but,  unfortunately,  the  multiple
scattered component does not follow this property very
well,  showing  a  significant  deviation  at  h=8-9(cid:176) ,  just
where  the  single  scattering  in  the  mesosphere  is  still
noticeable.  In  our  opinion,  this  deviation  can  be
accounted  for  by  rapid  change  of  the  contribution  of
double  scattering  against  the  background  of  higher-
order  scattering.  As  a  result,  the  scattering  coefficient
turns out to be overstated, particularly at high scatter-
ing  angles,  which  makes  the  study  of  mesospheric
aerosol difficult.

The main features of multiple scattered light (rela-
tive  weak  polarization  with q about  0.5  and  surplus  at
blue  part  of  spectra)  easily  describe  the  correlation  of
color and polarization changes of the twilight sky while
the sun is depressing under horizon. The explanation of
these effects with the account of only single scattering
meets the difficulties.

A number of color measurements of the sky ([2,7],
see Figure 3) and polarimetric measurements made here
reveal  the  simultaneous  change  of  the  sky  color  and
polarization.  The  sky  reddening  is  accompanied  by
increasing  of  polarization  (K decrease)  and  vice  versa.
This  evidently  shows  that  these  changes  can  have  the
common reason (cid:151) change of single- to multiple-scat-
tered light ratio.

MULTI-COLOR POLARIMETRY OF THE TWILIGHT SKY

At the light stage of twilight which starts before the
sunset  and  continues  until  the  depth  of  the  sun  under
horizon  about  4-5(cid:176) ,  observations  [7]  showed  the  red-
dening of the sky, and our 1997 and 2000 observations
revealed  the  slow  increase  of  polarization  degree.  The
role of (cid:147)red(cid:148) and more polarized single scattered light
at this stage even slightly increase with the depression of
sun. Besides that, the color of the sky at this stage can
be affected by ozone Chappuis absorption and (cid:147)barrier
effect(cid:148), as it was noticed in [7], but these effects were
overestimated  due  to  multiple  scattering  neglecting  in
that work. 

When the sun(cid:146)s depth under horizon exceeds 4-5(cid:176) ,
the picture sufficiently changes (cid:151) the sky gets bluer and
its  polarization  falls.  No  doubt  that  these  effects  are
related with the rapid decrease of single scattered light
contribution. But the polarization of multiple scattered
component itself slowly increase with the depression of
Sun, as we can see in Figure 13, due to the fact that the
secondary  source  of  light  (the  glow  segment)  becomes
more  narrow.  Finally,  at  sun(cid:146)s  depth  under  horizon
about 8-10(cid:176) , when the single scattering completely dis-
appears,  the  polarization  decrease  (the  increase  of  K)
stops and polarization increase starts.

Rapid overestimation of single scattered light contri-
bution made G.V. Rozenberg to relate this polarization
minimum at h=10(cid:176) with the existence of steady aerosol
layer at the altitudes of 80-100 km (in the mesosphere)
[2], however, this assumption accompanied by the blue
surplus of the sky spectrum may lead to the truly fan-
tastic properties of such aerosol particles: their scatter-
ing coefficient decreases with the wavelength faster than
the  Rayleigh  scattering  law  (l (cid:150)4)  [12]!  It  seems  quite
logical that the same journal release contained the paper
[13]  where  the  polarization  properties  in  blue  part  of
spectra for this stage of twilight were related with mul-
tiple  scattering,  although  for  larger  wavelength  the
influence of mesospheric aerosol was permitted.

All further changes of the twilight sky and polariza-
tion at the dark twilight stage (h>10(cid:176) ), in particular, its
next reddening noticed in [2] can be related only  with
the  properties  of  multiple  scattered  component  and
appearing nighttime sky background, that leads to polar-
ization decrease at the threshold of twilight turn to night.

7. CONCLUSION

The  primary  goal  of  these  work  was  to  develop  the
method of separation of single- and multiple-scattered
light in the twilight sky background and its use for the
results  of  polarimetric  twilight  observations  conducted
in 1997 and 2000 for different color bands.

This method separates two components with a good
accuracy if the influence of atmospheric aerosol single
scattering  is  insufficient.  This  situation  took  place  for
most part of observations at the 356 nm wavelength and
in  U,  B,  and  V  color  bands.  The  exception  was  only
some number of morning observations. The data obtain
in  the  R  color  band  shows  strong  influence  of  atmos-
pheric  aerosol  and  we  have  found  only  approximate

value (more possibly, the lower limit) of single scatter-
ing contribution.

The results being obtained shows the increase of sin-
gle  scattering  contribution  in  long-wave  part  of  spec-
trum. This fact along with the polarization properties of
multiple  scattering  explains  the  color  and  polarization
changes  of  the  twilight  sky  with  the  sun(cid:146)s  depression
under horizon. The values of single scattering contribu-
tion are near to theoretical ones only for light stage of
twilight,  it  becoming  less  than  theoretical  ones  at  the
deeper  stages.  The  reasons  for  these  disagreements  are
discussed in this paper.

The  increase  of  single  scattered  light  contribution
with  the  wavelength  makes  the  green-yellow  part  of
spectrum (the V band) to be the most effective for twi-
light  probing  the  atmosphere  and  its  ozone  layer  by
Chappuis  absorption.  Further  increase  of  wavelength
will  meet  the  difficulties  related  with  tropospheric
aerosol light scattering.

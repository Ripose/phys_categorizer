Pseudoscopic (inverted depth) images that keep a continuous parallax were shown to be 

possible by use of a double diffraction process intermediated by a slit. One diffraction 

grating directing light to the slit acts as a wavelength encoder of views, while a second 

diffraction grating decodes the projected image. The process results in the enlargement 

of  the  image  under  common  white  light  illumination up to infinite magnification at  a 

critical point. We show that this point corresponds to another simple-symmetry object-

observer system. Our treatment allows us to explain the experience by just dealing with 

main ray directions.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Direct  pseudoscopic  images  are  uncommon  in  optics.  Recently,  a  pseudoscopic  image  was 

demonstrated  in  refractive  optics,1  but  more  widely  known  are  registered  images,  such  as 

inverted stereo pairs  or holographic images. Pseudoscopic holographic imaging may render 

inverted  depth  images  in  continuous  parallax  exclusively  under  monochromatic  light  or 

through some process that renders the final image monochromatic at least over the horizontal 

field of view. We demonstrated previously,2 that diffraction could be combined with a simple 

process  to  obtain  reversed  depth  images  whose  continuous  horizontal  parallax  is  due 

exclusively to diffractive elements. This new kind of image is of interest because it opens up 

the possibility of comparing the its parallax field and image quality with those produced by 

conventional 

imaging  systems.  New  optical  systems  based  on  double  diffraction 

intermediated by a refractive element3 could also benefit from knowledge of the properties of 

a  simpler  system  such  as  ours.  In  this  paper  we  show  additional  properties  of  this  kind  of 

image: image resolution, presence of astigmatism, viewing angular field, field of view, and 

magnification. We analyze the case of propagation in a plane that is not perpendicular to the 

gratings, giving experimental evidence of the pseudoscopic image, its spectral composition, 

its magnification and the existence of a critical point.  

The system is depicted in the simple symmetry of Fig. 1. Our system consists of two 

identical  diffraction  gratings,  DG1  and  DG2,  symmetrically  located  at  either  side  of  an 

aperture  a.  The  plane  of  the  figure  corresponds  to  the  horizontal  plane  P   of  the  aperture, 

while the lines of the grating are in a vertical direction. λ , λM m are the extreme wavelengths of 

the  visible  spectrum.  An  object  of  white  or  gray  tonality  is  illuminated  by  common  white 

light diffusing at a very wide angle, for example, from point A, whose coordinates are X, Y, Z. 

Xi  is  the  generic  coordinate  corresponding  to  the  point  of  incidence  of  the  light  rays  that 

impinge on the first grating  and may reach the slit after diffraction. 

  

 

 We consider the part of the beam reaching the grating that, after diffraction, travels 

toward  the  aperture.  ZR  is  the  distance  from  the  slit  to  the  first  grating,  made  equal  to  the 

distance  from  the  slit  to  the  second  grating,  the  symmetry  condition.  Deviation  of  rays  by 

diffraction is given by the basic grating equation, 

sin

iθ

- sin

dθ

  = λ ν,                                                      (1) 

where 

iθ

represents  the  angle  of  incidence  of  light  traveling  from  point  A  to  points  on  the 

grating, 

dθ  represents the angle of diffraction of light that travels from points on the grating 

to  point  P, ν  is  the  inverse  of  the  grating  period,  and  λ  represents  the  wavelength  value 

corresponding to each ray.  

We  see  from  Fig.  1  and  Eq.  (1)  that  the  angle 

iθ   of  incidence  into  the  first  grating 

through which the wavelength   λ will be allowed to enter the slit can be obtained from the 

equation

This is the way in which we demonstrated  the formation of the pseudoscopic image.  In Fig. 

1, we are dealing with an image that is convergent in the horizontal plane but that does not 

converge vertically due to beam divergence in the vertical plane. This situation changes when 

we consider an observer, because the reduced diameter of the pupils of the observer’s eyes 

causes the image to be convergent on the retinas. 

  

 

2. IMAGE RESOLUTION 

The perfect symmetry of the system precludes the existence of aberrations in a horizontal ray 

tracing  analysis  so  that  is  not  appropiated  to  make  the  classical  first  order  and  third  order 

aberration analysis. The image quality can only be degraded horizontally due to the width of 

the slit or the defects of the diffracting elements. The slit does not interfere in the direct visual 

observation process vertically, but it creates a lateral wavelength blurring of the same angular 

extension as its aperture similar to that of a pinhole camera. We see the situation in Fig. 2, 

where  the  width  of  the  slit  was  effectively  considered  by  including  the  two  rays  that  pass 

through the borders of the slit instead of a single ray going through its center. Two points A’1 

and A’  are the symmetricals of the object point A corresponding to the border points P

2 

1 and 

P2,  defining  an  extension 

a2

.  The  dashed  lines  were  added  to  the  scheme  to  help 

understanding  this.  It  appears  to  the  observer  that  the  image  point  has  an  extension

IMAGE QUALITY 

3. PRESENCE OF ASTIGMATISM AND CONSIDERATIONS ON 

It  happens  that  the  eye  of  the  observer  will  always  be  focusing  at  points  whose 

distance corresponds to the distance traveled by the light in the vertical plane, and at the same 

time, at the points where the slit and the second diffraction grating perform the image, in the 

horizontal  plane.  This  combination  of  two  focal  properties  creates  astigmatism  (see  Fig.  3) 

which is proportional to the diameter of the eye’s pupil. Calculating with the Emsley4 model 

of  the  eye  and  considering  a  pupil  diameter  of  3  mm  and  the  data  of  our  experiment,  the 

astigmatic image of a point results 0.07 mm high at the retina. 

 The perception of depth by binocular vision is a triangulation operation acting on the 

horizontal  plane,  so  that  depth  is  determined  by  the  horizontal  rays.  We  can  highlight  the 

  

 

particular  properties  of  our  system  having  reduced  chromatic  aberrations  because  of  the 

wavelength  spreading  distribution.  Surface  flaw  of  the  diffractive  elements  are  also  less 

important due to the tolerance of transmission gratings, which makes deflection be dependent 

mainly on the period of the grating and very little on the inclination of the grating. Geometric 

distortion exists only as the result of a different vertical and horizontal scale, linearity being 

preserved on each of both scales. They can eventually be matched by properly choosing the 

value of the period for both gratings.  

4. VIEWING ANGULAR FIELD 

 

 
The  horizontal  angular  parallax  can  be  calculated  by  considering  two  points  of  the 

object and the path that is allowed to light whose wavelength values are on extremes of the 

spectrum.  The  angular  region  limited  by  this  rays  is  the  common  region  for  simultaneous 

observation of the two points and includes all intermediary points (see Fig. 4). X , XAi 

Bi are 

coordinates corresponding to the points of incidence of the light rays  from points A and B 

respectively in the first grating. Due to the symmetry of the system all rays reach the second 

grating at points such as X ’, XAi

Bi’. Employing Eq. (3) to get the value of Xi and introducing 

it into Eq. (2) the result is:

An equation which we do not calculated but solved numerically. We can then obtain 

the  angular  field  θΔ   by  calculating  two  λ  values  at  the  extreme  wavelengths  at  the 

corresponding  extreme  lateral  points  of  the  object  and  subtracting  them.  The  analysis  must 

then  be  made  for  points  at  extreme  lateral  and  depth  points  of  the  object.  The  resulting 

expression is:

We  solve  it  numerically  by  means  of  the  software  Mathematica  4.1.  The  calculated 

value  for  the  data  of  our  experimental  case  is  in  Table  1  altogether  with  the  experimental 

result. It is possible to obtain a case where the expression for  θΔ  is simple by choosing the 

case which considers point A in a position where  Mλ  is diffracted perpendicullarly through 

DG1 so impinging into DG2 and point B in a position where  mλ  does the same. Considering 

that Eq. (2) can then be substituted for: 

θ arcsin

i =

                                                                           (6) 

The  symmetry  of  the  problem  allows  using  the  same  values  of  the  field  θΔ

  at  the 

θΔ

second stage for analyzing the viewing situation. So that we have:

as the value of the horizontal angular parallax. For 

Mλ

 = 650 nm and 

mλ

 = 450 nm 

we obtain 

o5.6=Δθ

.  Doubling the number of lines per millimeter this field is also doubled, 

indicating that it is possible to make a system for binocular observation of the image. 

5. FIELD OF VIEW AND CRITICAL POINT 

 

Figure  5  shows  as  a  shadowed  angle  the  object  field  of  view  for  a  fixed  position 

(

,

c

)

 of the observer. CP is the point symmetrical to the observer’s position.Assuming two 

light rays which may go through this point and reach the observer’s position, X

CPi1 

and X

Cpi2 

are their abscisas. The region seen of an object depends on the object distance in a manner 

which resembles that of an object under a converging lens: it can change dramatically when 

close to a certain critical distance which renders infinite magnification. This happens at the 

critical  point  CP  as  follows:  by  including  in  the  system  an  object  in  three  different  depth 

  

 

positions O1

, O , O
2

3 , we can notice that a very small area is imaged as the object approaches 

the  critical  point.  The  situation  is  explained  in  Fig.  5(b)  in  the  case  when  the  viewpoint  is 

symmetric  to  the  object.  It  is  clear  from  the  figures  how  magnification  may  vary  with 

longitudinal  object  position.  The  whole  field  of  view  between  X ’  and  X

2

1’  can  be  fulfilled 

either by some extension of the object or by a single object point in the critical case when the 

object is at CP. Comparing Fig. 5(a) with Fig. 5(c), the crossing of rays which corresponded 

to laterally extreme object points explains the lateral inversion on the image.  

6. CASE OF PROPAGATION IN A PLANE THAT IS NOT 

PERPENDICULAR TO THE GRATINGS 

Our first analysis was based on Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 assuming that the observer is located 

on the same horizontal plane than the object and it includes a perpendicular to the gratings as 

shown  for  observer  O1  in  Fig.  6.  That  horizontal  plane  is  then  the  plane  H  of  wavelength 

dispersion  .  If  we  consider  now  the  observer  being  located  over  or  under  that  plane  the 

difference  would  be  in  that  case  that  dispersion  does  not  happens  perpendicularly  to  the 

gratings. Let us analize now the propagation in another plane at an angle α to plane H for the 

image to be seen by the vertically displaced observer O2.  All rays that diverge in that upward 

direction do not properly satisfy Eq. (1), but another one5 that includes the value of its angle 

of incidence as determined by polar coordinates ( ϕθ,

).

This  diffraction  case  is  denominated  as  “conical  diffraction”  by  some  authors .

Although a ray may rise over the oblique plane it goes under it after the slit and finally the 

point-symmetric  situation  remains  the  same.  A  new  plane  of  symmetry  could  be  drawn  for 

each  ray  which  enters  at  any  azimuthal  angle  but  the  image  point  i  can  not  be  precisely 

determined anymore, and some aberration may be present. The vertical parallax and field of 

  

 

view are easy to predict by triangulation because both are directly allowed by the height of 

the slit. 

7. INCREASING THE DISTANCE TO THE SECOND GRATING 

When the distance of the second grating to the slit is doubled, because the angles of 

incidence at DG2 are the same, two consequences are clear: the image is magnified because it 

is extended through the grating and the observer must move  to 

(

x

,'

z

c

c

)'

  to keep the critical 

point at the same place than before (see Fig. 7). If the observer moves laterally to follow the 

view of the object while the grating is being displaced, the result will be that of  Fig. 8 and 

the position of the critical point comes closer to the system. 

8. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

             

We  employed  two  plastic  embossed  holographic  transmission  gratings  of  the  same 

type,  commercially  available  for  architectural  or  educational  purposes.  Both  had 

533 ±  
5

lines/mm and were fixed between two glass plates 2 mm thick. Their effective area employed 

was  60  mm  x  40  mm.  They  were  located 

600 ± mm  apart  in  a  parallel  position  and  a 

2

vertical black paper slit 

15.07.0 ±

mm wide was in between both gratings. Parallelism of the 

grating planes was verified to better than 

1± mm by making coincident reflections of a diode 

laser beam which traversed the slit, impinged on both gratings and returned to the laser exit 

window.  Photographs  were  made  with  SONY  video  8  Handycam  camera  connected  to  a 

Pentium I computer to get 240 x 320-pixel resolution. In a first experience we employed an 

85 mm long almost vertical luminous filament from a 300 W halogenous lamp, inclined with 

its higher extreme being at a distance of 230 mm to the grating, closer than its other extreme 

which  was  at  280  mm  from  it.  The  camera  was  at  a  1,015  mm  distance.  The  object  was 

inclined  frontally  in  order  to  show  with  a  stereo  photographic  pair  that  the  image  is 

pseudoscopic.  We  found  two  viewpoints  showing  the  filament  in  a  frontal  view  and  in  a 

  

 

lateral  view,  demonstrating  the  depht  inversion  in  Fig.  9  because  the  right-hand  side  view 

shows a vertical line while the left-hand side view shows the upper part inclined to the left, a 

parallax  sequence  corresponding  to  an  object  which  is  inclined  to  the  back.  A  second 

experience  with  the  object  at  the  same  position  showed  the  image  seen  from  the  same 

viewpoint (red wavelength)  as shown in Fig. 10 where we show the unfiltered image to be 

compared with the image as seen alternatively with two interference filters. The wavelength 

limitation shows the correspondance between wavelength value and the horizontal part of the 

image. Our third experiment employed as object an halogeneous 50 W lamp with its mirror 

and compares the original image with the image obtained after doubling the distance of the 

second grating to the slit. The object was located at X = 221 ± 5 mm , Z = 68 ± 5 mm and 

observer  at 

=cx

202 ±

5

  mm  and 

=cz

928 ±

5

mm  The  observer’s  viewpoint  needed  to  be 

changed 80 mm to the right. The image is seen in Fig. 11 and resulted magnified by a factor 

of    4.  In  our  fourth  experiment  we  employed  as  object  the  shadow  of  a  paper  clip  located 

against  a  diffusing  background.  We  needed  to  do that instead of illuminating the clip itself 

because we needed a brighter image on the camera to be accepted by the exposure system. 

The average mean intensity in this case results to be much higher. The clip is made of wire 1 

mm  thick  and  we  employed  its  asymmetric  shape  to  identify  the  inversion  properties 

corresponding  to  the  dispersion  direction.  The  background  remained  fixed  at  1,680  mm 

distance while the clip was located at three different positions: between the system and the 

critical point at 960 mm, at the critical point at 1,270 mm, and farther from the critical point 

at 1,540 mm, respectively. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 12 and the resulting images in 

Fig.  13.    Besides  showing  clearly  the  inversion  the  image  appears  quite  undistorted  and 

infinite magnification is evident through the whole extension of the elongated image resulting 

at the critical point.  Our final experiment consisted in measuring the viewing angular field. 

For simplicity of comparison the result was included with the theoretical values of Table 1.

  

 

9. CONCLUSIONS 

The symmetry of the developed system shows an easy way to analyze its images, and 

the quality of the images is close to the resolution of the naked eye.   Although not intended 

for  educational  purposes  but  for  developing  new  imaging  systems  having  less  weight  and 

volume, the system is so simple that any person with minimal skill can experience the new 

properties of diffractive white light imaging. We may then conclude that the ray distribution 

generated after the second diffraction may be always considered as a decoding of the effect of 

the  primary  grating  and  that  the  original  intensity  distribution  of  rays  from  the  object  was 

maintained  through  this  selective  wavelength  distribution  process.  Although  the  diffracting 

elements acts in one direction only and does not project an image, it is possible to have a two-

dimensional  equivalent  by  using  circular  diffraction  gratings,  a  result  to  be  published 

elsewhere.

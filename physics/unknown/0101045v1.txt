SOLUTION) THAT ARE ASYMPTOTICALLY STATIC AT INFINITY 

 

John E Heighway 

The present work is an extension of the paper entitled “Towards a deeper 

Understanding of General Relativity,” paper number  gr-qc/0001036 [1].  In the 

referenced paper, it is shown that ordinary GR admits an extended interpretation 

as a variable rest mass theory.  As argued in that paper, the dependence of rest 

mass upon gravitational potential affects not only the rate of clocks (the so-called 

time dilation effect) but also results in the elongation of measuring rods. In view 

of these circumstances, an alternate system of measurment that is unaffected by 

gravity is introduced, resulting in a new metric which is conformally related to 

the usual proper metric of GR.  Evidence is presented to show that the new 

“telemetric” system of measurment results in a geometry has an excellent claim 

to be the true geometry of the Schwarzschild solution.  The purpose of the 

present paper is to extend the Variable Rest Mass (VRM) Interpretation and the 

telemetric system of measurment to the case of stationary but non-static 

spacetimes, especially the Kerr solution. 

Introduction 

The approach taken here is to separate dynamical (frame-dragging) effects from 

those that may be thought of as purely gravitational effects. 

For each point in the field, a velocity is calculated which maximizes the rate of a 

clock moving with that velocity.  The residual slowing of such clocks is assumed 

to be purely gravitational and, in accord with the VRM Interpretation, the

concomitant length dilation effect fixes the relation between the usual geometry 

defined by proper measurements, on the one hand, and the telemetric geometry, 

on the other. 

In order to test the theory, the method is applied to the Kerr solution, and the 

results are used to calculate the location of the famous unstable photon orbits. 

The orbits are calculated by assuming that the they will lie on circles whose 

(telemetric) curvature matches that induced in the ray paths by the shear in the 

frame-dragging velocity.  The results are exactly those calculated directly by the 

usual methods. 

Geometry and Frame Dragging 

In the paper [1] referenced in the introduction, it is emphasized that the telemetric 

system of measurement has as its basis the fact that in any stationary field the 

frequency of light is constant along its path.  That paper considered only the 

Schwarzschild field, which is not just stationary, but static.  The Telemetric 

system can be extended to fields that are stationary but non-static, provided that 

they are asymptotically static at infinity.  This condition is necessary in order to 

insure that a single time standard can be propagated to all observers.  

In non-static stationary fields, the metric tensor contains mixed space-time 

components which cannot be eliminated except at the cost of introducing explicit 

time dependence.  In such situations, one must disentangle geometric effects 

from the dynamical effects associated with the so-called ‘frame-dragging’ 

phenomenon.  The Kerr solution provides an excellent example of this.  Here 

space itself seems to be moving in circles in a vortex-like manner about the 

rotating object, as evidenced by the fact that light rays reflected by a series of 

Kerr  2.5 

2 

 

 

 

mirrors arranged on a circle centered on the axis of rotation will require less time 

when directed with the rotation as compared with rays directed oppositely.  

Furthermore, in the limit of infinitely many mirrors, i.e., for a circular path, the 

results are compatible with an interpretation, which assigns an azimuthal 

velocity, v, to that which must remain nameless for fear of using the ae-word, 

such that the circuit times are inversely proportional to c+v and c–v respectively.  

Furthermore, and this is a crucial point, the rate of a clock is maximized when it 

‘goes with the flow,’ i.e., when it moves with the same azimuthal velocity, v.  

Finally, the slowing of stationary proper clocks by the factor √[1 –(v/c)2] in 

relation to the maximum rate can be understood in terms of the special relativity 

time dilation effect. 

The telemetric interpretation understands the time dilation of the fastest, ‘go-with 

-the-flow’ clocks as resulting from the rest-mass reduction effect, and the 

concomitant length dilation effect fixes the relationship between telemetric 

lengths and proper lengths in the v-moving frame.  These considerations allow 

one to disentangle the dynamical and geometric effects. 

Finding the Fastest Clocks 

For the general case, one must determine the velocity, v, at each point in space- 

time such that the rate of a clock moving with that velocity is a maximum.  The 
rate of a clock relative to world time is ds/dx0 where 

 

(ds/dx0)2 = g00 + 2g0α (dxα/dx0) + gαβ(dxα/dx0)(dxβ/dx0)  

Here regarding sub- or super-scripts we use Greek for space indices (1,2,3) and 

Latin for space-time (0,1,2,3).  Also the sign of our gik are reversed as compared 

with Landau and Lifshitz.

Setting the derivative of (ds/dx0)2 with respect to (dxα/dx0) equal to zero yields 
the system of equations for the motion dxα/dx0 which will maximize the rate of a 

clock.  The system of equations which results simplifies to [A1]  

The inverse of the pure space submatrix gαβ  is [2] 

  

 

 

 

 

gαβ

 dxβ/dx0

  = – g0α  

gαβ – g0α g0β/g00 

The solution to the system is thus [A2] 

dxα/dx0 = –(gαβ– g0α g0β/g00) g0β   =  goα/g00 

Inserting this result into the expression for (ds/dx0)2 one finds [A3]  

(ds/dx0)2 = 1/g00 

 
For the Schwarzschild metric, 1/g00 = g00 . Our result is thus consonant with the 

results of reference [1]. 

The Frame Dragging Velocity 

The contravariant components of the flow velocity are defined by [3] 
βα :=  vα/c :=   (dxα/dx0)/{√g00[1+(g0α/g00)(dxα/dx0)]} 

 

which reduces to [A4] 

βα =  √(g00) g0α                                      

The covariant components are obtained using the pure space metric tensor [4] 

λµν  = –gµν + g0µg0ν/g00                                 

Thus [A5] 

βα = λαµ βµ  = g0α/√(g00)                                 

The physical velocity has magnitude β where 
β2 = βαβα = g0αg0α = 1 –  g00g00

and finalIy, the gamma factor for the fIow is 
γ  =  1/√(1-β2)   =  1/√(g00g00) 

 

The Telemetric Line Element 

 
Next we shall introduce what may be called ‘go-with-the-flow’ coordinates xα 

satisfying 

dxα  = dxα  – g0α/g00 dx0                                   

Inserting these reduces the invariant line element to [A6] 

ds2 = 1 /g00 (dx0)2 + gαβdxα dxβ   

From this we can deduce the telemetric line element, which uses 

world time, and bases its distance measurements on echo ranging 
using world time.  Thus g*00 = 1 , and λ*αβ  = – g00gαβ,  and we can write 

ds*2  =   (dx0)2 + g00 gαβ dxα dxβ  =  g00 ds2 

Thus the conformal relationship between telemetric and proper metrics holds in 

the more general case, provided that one properly takes account of the dynamical 

effects of  ‘frame dragging.’ 

The Kerr Solution 

For the Kerr solution these results may be listed using the usual coordinates and 

abbreviations 

 

 rs  :=  2GM/c2,    a := L/Mc,   L = angular momentum,  M = mass 
ρ2 :=  r2 + a2 cos2θ,    and     ∆ :=  r2 + a2  – rs r  
along with     u4 := ρ2(r2 + a2) + rs r a2sin2θ,    as follows: 

 

Kerr  2.5 

5 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dφ/dx0  =  rs r a/u4 ,         β= rs r a sinθ/(ρ2√∆) 
γ = (ρ2√∆)/[√(ρ2 – rs r)u2] 
(dτ/dτ∗)max = 1/√g00 = (ρ√∆)/u2 

This last form is equal to the mass-reduction factor, i.e., 

m*e/me = 1/√g00 = (ρ√∆)/u2 

and thus the event horizon occurs where ∆ = 0.  Thus there are two 

such surfaces, the ‘spheres’ ( r is only a parameter) defined by 
rh = rs/2 {1 ± √[1 – (2a/rs)2]}                                

 

The region between these horizons seems unphysical, since in that region, the 

coordinate r becomes timelike while t becomes spacelike.  The region for which r 

falls in the range between zero and the smaller horizon value may represent 

another universe which seems not to have been investigated. 

For values of the parameter, a , greater than rs /2, both horizons vanish, and this 

exotic universe (Shangri-La ?) merges with the innerspace of our universe. 

The metric forms of interest are 

stationary 

ds2 =  (ρ2 –rsr)ρ-2 (dx0)2 + 2rs r a sin2θρ-2 dx0dφ 
– u4 ρ-2 sin2θ dφ2 – ρ2/∆ dr2 – ρ2dθ2 

 

go-with-the-flow [A7] 

telemetric 

ds2 = ρ2 ∆/u4 (dx0)2  – u4 ρ-2 sin2θ dφ2 – ρ2 / ∆ dr2 – ρ2 dθ2 

ds*2 = (dx0)2 – u8/(ρ4∆) sin2θ dφ2  – u4/∆2 dr2 – u4/∆  dθ2.

In order to demonstrate the heuristic value of the telemetric interpretation, we 

shall investigate the two unstable photon orbits which occur in the Kerr solution.  

We need first to define the functions r* and R*.  Let 

r* := u4 / (ρ2√∆)    and      dR*/dr  :=  u2/∆  

so that the element of telemetric length in the φ  and r  directions are r*sinθ dφ, 

and dR*, respectively. 

The Photon Orbits 

Regarding the photon orbits, one would expect that in the outer region, beyond 

the stenosurface, wavefronts propagating in the counter-fIow direction would be 

turned inward because of the shear in the flow.  The curvature, κ ,  of the ray is 

Referring to the embedding diagram shown in figure 1, one has  

easily calculated. 

ρ∗/r∗ =  dR*/dr∗ 

whence the telemetric curvature of a circle in the equatorial section is 

κo = 1/ρ∗ = (1/r∗) (dr*/dR*)  = d/dR*[ln(r*)] 

From figure 2, depicting the (flattened) cone tangent to the embedding surface of 

figure 1, one has two equal expressions for the angle 

[c-v(R*–∆R*)]∆t/(κ-1 –∆R*) = [c–v(R*+∆R*)]∆t/(κ-1 +∆R*) 

Expanding v in a Taylors series, one has for ∆R* → 0, 

κ = –(dv/dR*)/(c–v) = d/dR*[ln(c–v)] 

 If the telemetric picture correctly deals with dynamics and geometry, then the 

photon orbit should occur when these curvatures match, implying 

d/dR*[r*/(c–v)l = 0  

Kerr  2.5 

7 

 

 

 

 

 

Now 2πr*/(c–v) is just the telemetric transit time for a light signal traversing the 

ring of mirrors, and one would expect that this circle would correspond to an 

orbit when the transit time is a minimum.  But expectations aside, it turns out that 

the above equation is in fact satisfied by the actual photon orbit as determined in 

the usual way, as will now be shown. 

For the region inside the stenosurface, a wavefront propagating in the same 

direction as the rotation will be turned so as to circle that surface.  In this case the 

curvatures are 

 

κ = d/dR*[ln(c+v)]   and   κo = d/dR*[ln(r*)] 

so that the orbit should satisfy  d/dR*[r*/(c+v)l = 0 

The two cases will be treated simultaneously.  With the benefit of hindsight, one 

may simplify the work by writing 

 

r*/(l " β)  =  r∗(1 ! β)/(1 – β2) =  (ρ2√∆ ! rs r a sinθ)/(ρ2 –rsr) 
The orbits lie in the equatorial plane, so that ρ = r.  Also, R* is a monotone 

function of r.  We may thus write the equations as 

d/dr [(r√∆ ± rsa)/(r – rs)] = 0  

This results in the following equation, valid for both orbits [A8] 
2 r – 8 rs a2  = 0.                                         

4 r3 – 12 rs r2 + 9 rs

 

Setting A = 2a/rs , the solutions may be written, first for the outer, retrograde 

orbit, 

rph-/rs  =  l + cos(2/3 acos(A)) , 

 

=  l + cosh(2/3 acosh(A)) , 

for A< 1 , 

for A> 1 , 

and for the “inner” (smaller values of r), prograde orbit, 

rph+/rs =  l + cos(2/3 acos(–A)) 

These are the well-known (unstable) photon orbits [5].  The third root,

rph+?/rs =  l – cos(1/3 acos(1 – 2A2))  

is a prograde orbit in the ‘Shangri-La’ universe mentioned earlier. 

Figure 3 shows the embedding diagram for the equatorial section of the Kerr 
geometry for three values of the rotation parameter A = 2a/rs (labeled α in fig 3). 

The heavy dots indicate the location of the photon orbits.

But the 2nd and 3rd last terms are identical and 

gαβg0β/g00 = [gαkg0k – gα0g00]/g00 = –gα0 

Thus the space-time cross terms vanish.  Also,  g0αg0α = 1 – g00g00 and 

 gαβg0αg0β = [gkβg0k – g0βg00]g0β =  – g0βg0βg00 = – [1 – g00g00]g00 

Finally the coefficient of (dx0)2 is 

g00 + 2[1 – g00g00]/g00 – [1 – g00g00]/g00 = g00 + [1 – g00g00]/g00 = 1/g00

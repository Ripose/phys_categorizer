                                               Abstract 
 
          The present paper is devoted to consideration and discussion of a number of  
contradictions that take place in fundamental electrodynamics researches. A con-
cept of the scalar-vector potential is introduced that allows us to avoid a number of 
challenges taking place in treatment of forces of elecrtromagnetic interaction. It is 
introduced the delayed scalar-vector potential allowing one to solve radiation prob-
lems at an elementary level. It is shown that in a nonmagnetized plasma, beside the 
earlier known longitudinal Langmuir resonance, there may exist a resonance trans-
versal relative to the wave propagation direction. It is also shown that the dielectric 
and magnetic permittivities are independent on the frequency. It is introduced a 
concept of the kinetic capacitance.    
 
 
                                                    Introduction 
 
          We got used to such a concept as magnetic field insomuch that could not 
imagine contemporary electrodynamics without it. This habit forced us to blink at 
the obvious imperfections of this theory. The concept of magnetic field assumes 
the presence of magnetic forces only between charges that move relative to an im-
mobile reference system. It is supposed that some moving charges induce a mag-
netic field and some ones interact with this field. From this it follows that two 
charges moving in parallel must attract one another. However, if one turns to an-
other reference system moving together with the charges then there are no mag-
netic fields in such a system. It should be noted that the contradiction considered 
can not be eliminated neither in the frame of classical electrodynamics, nor in the 
frame of special theory of relativity. 
           Another disconformity consists in that the forces acting between current-
carrying systems, as well as poderomotive forces are applied not to moving 
charges but to the ion lattice. In the concept of magnetic field there are no direc-
tions why the force impact is exerted on the lattice but not the moving charges. 

          Unfortunately, nobody pays attention some how to these obvious discom-
formities. At the same time, neglecting these facts recoils negatively upon solving 
a number of physical and technical problems. The main hopes of implementation 
of controlled thermonuclear synthesis are currently associated with employment of 
the pinch-effect, however, we have no clear notion of why not only moving elec-
trons undergo the contraction but also ions. 
 
 
                    1. Equations of electromagnetic induction  
                                       in moving coordinates 

 

The Maxwell equations do not permit us to write down the fields in moving 

coordinates proceeding from the known fields measured in the stationary coordi-
nates. Generally, this can be done through the Lorentz transformations but they so 
not follow from classical electrodynamics. This brings up the question: Can classi-
cal electrodynamics furnish correct results for the fields in a moving coordinate 
system, or at least offer an acceptable approximation? If so, what form will the 
equations of electromagnetic induction have? 

The Lorentz force is

It bears the name of Lorentz it follows from his transformations which per-
mit writing the fields in the moving coordinates if the fields in the stationary coor-
dinates are known. Henceforward, the fields and forces generated in a moving co-
ordinate system will be indicated with primed symbols.  

The clues of how to write the fields in moving coordinates if they are known 

in the stationary system are available even in the Faraday law. Let us specify the 
form of the Faraday law:

and unprimed for stationary coordinates. In the latter case the right-hand side of 
Eq. (1.2) should contain a partial derivative with respect to time which fact is gen-
erally not mentioned in literature. 

 and 

The total derivative with respect to time in Eq. (1.2) implies that the final re-
sult for the contour e.m.f. is independent of the  variation mode of the flux. In other 
r
words, the flux can change either purely with time variations of  B

which suggests that the motion in the magnetic field excites an additional electric 
field described  by the final term in Eq. (1.6). Note that Eq. (1.6) is obtained from 
the slightly specified Faraday law and not from the Lorentz transformations. 
 According to Eq. (1.6), a charge moving in the magnetic field is influenced 
by a force perpendicular to the direction of the motion. However, the physical na-
ture of this force has never been considered. This brings confusion into the expla-
nation of the homopolar generator operation and does not permit us to explain the 
electric fields outside an infinitely long solenoid on the basis of the Maxwell equa-
tions.

As seen in Eq. (1.9), the field strength, and hence the force acting upon a charge 
consists of three components. 

The first component describes the pure time variations of the magnetic vec-
tor potential. The second term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9)  is evidently con-
nected with the changes in the vector potential caused by the motion of a charge in 
the spatially varying field of this potential. The origin of the last term in the right-
hand side of Eq. (1.9) is quite different. It is connected with the potential forces

just as the scalar potential gradient does. 
 Using Eq. (1.9), we can explain physically all the strength components of the 
electronic field excited in the moving and stationary cooperates. If our concern is 
with the electric fields outside a long solenoid, where the no magnetic field, the 
first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9) come into play. In the case of a ho-
mopolar generator, the force acting upon a charge is determined by the last two 
terms in the right-hand side of Eq.(1.9), both of them contributing equally. 

)

It is therefore incorrect to look upon the homopolar generator as the excep-

tion to the flow rule [1-2] because, as we saw above, this rule allows for all the 
three components. Using the rotor in both sides of  Eq. (1.10) and taking into ac-
count  rot grad ”

If motion is absent,  Eq. (1.11) turns into Maxwell equation (1.2). Equation (1.11) 
is certainly less informative than Eq.  (1.2):  because of  rot grad ”

 0, it does not in-

clude the forces defined in terms of 
to use Eq. (1.2) if we want to allow for all components of the electric fields acting 
upon a charge both in the stationary and in the moving coordinates. 
 As a preliminary conclusion, we may state that the Faraday Law,  Eq. (1.2), 
when examined closely, explains clearly all features of the homopolar generator 
operation, and this operation principle is a consequence, rather than an exception, 

. It is therefore more reasonable

 for the “varying field” are absolutely different laws is 

contrary to fact. The Faraday law is just the sole unified fundamental principle 
which Feynman declared to be missing. Let us clear up another Feynman’s inter-
pretation. Faraday’s observation in fact led him to discovery of a new law relating 
electric and magnetic fields in the region where the magnetic field varies with time

and thus generates the electric field. This correlation is essentially true but not 
complete. As shown above, the electric field can also be excited where there is no 
magnetic field, namely, outside an infinitely long solenoid. A more complete for-

mulation follows from Eq. (1.9) and the relationship

 This suggests that a moving or stationary charge interacts with the field of 
the magnetic vector potential rather than with the magnetic field. The knowledge 
of this potential and its evolution can only permit us to calculate all the force com-
ponents acting upon charges. The magnetic field is merely a spatial derivative of 
the vector field.  

As follows from the above consideration, it is more appropriate to write the

 The Faraday law, Eq. (1.2) is referred to as the law of electromagnetic induc-
tion because it shows how varying magnetic fields can generate electric fields. 
However, classical electrodynamics contains no law of magnetoelectric induction 
showing how magnetic fields can be excited by varying electric fields. This aspect 
of classical electrodynamics evolved along a different pathway. First, the law

tions, i.e. in the framework of special theory of relativity (STR). Thus, the STR re-

These equations present the law of magnetoelectric induction written in terms of 
the electric vector potential. 
 To illustrate the importance of the introduction of the electric vector poten-
tial, we come back to an infinitely long solenoid. The situation is much the same, 

r
 are replaced with the vectors  D
and the only change is that the vectors 
situation is quite realistic: it occurs when the space between the flat capacitor 
plates is filled with high electric inductivities. In  this case the displacement flux is 
almost entirely inside the dielectric. The attempt  to calculate the magnetic field 
r

) runs into the same prob-
outside the space occupied by the dielectric (where 
r
lem that existed for the calculation beyond the fields  E
 of an infinitely long sole-
noid. The introduction of the electric vector potential permits a correct solution of 
this problem. This however brings up the question of priority: what is primary and 
what is secondary? The electric vector potential is no doubt primary because elec-
tric vortex fields are excited only where the rotor of such potential is non-zero. 
 As follows from Eqs. (1.20), if the reference systems move relative to each  
r
other, the fields  E

r
parallel conducting plates with the electric field  E
 in between. In this case the sur-
face charge  rS per unit area of each plate is  eЕ. If the other reference system is 
made to move parallel to the plates in the field 
will generate an additional field  DН =  DVeЕ. If a third reference system starts to 
move at the velocity  DV, within the above moving system, this motion in the field 
DН will generate  DЕ =  meDV2Е, which is another contribution to the field  Е. The 
field  E ¢  thus becomes stronger in the moving system than it is in the stationary 
one. It is reasonable to suppose that the surface charge at the plates of the initial

 As an example, let us analyze how Eqs. (1.25) can account for the phenome-

Assume that there are plane wave components  HZ and  EX, and the primed 
system is moving along the  x-axis at the velocity  VX. The field components with in 
the primed coordinates can be written as

          Hence, the Poynting vector no longer follows the direction of the  y-axis. It is 
in the  xy-plane and tilted about the  y-axis at an angle determined by Eqs. (1.27). 
The ratio between the absolute values of the vectors  Е and  Н is the same in both 
the systems. This is just what is known as phase aberration in classical electrody-
namics.  
 

    2. The force interaction  between current-carreging conductors  
 
 As follows from the transformations in Eq. (1.25) if two charges move at the 
r
relative velocity  V
, their interaction is determined not only by the absolute values 
of the charges but by the relative motion velocity as well. The new value of the in-

Eqs. (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) apparently account for the change in the value of the 
moving charges. 
 Using these equations, it is possible to calculate the force of the conductor-
current interactions and allow, through superposition, for the interaction forces of 
all moving and immobile charges in the conductors. We thus obtain all currently 
existing laws of electromagneticm.

 Let us examine the force, interaction of two 
assuming that the electron velocities in the conductors are  V1 and  V2. The moving 
charge values per unit length of the conductors are  g1 and g2. 
 In terms of the present-day theory of electromagnetism, the forces of the in-
teraction of the conductors can be found by two methods. 
         One of the conductors (e.g., the lower one) generates the magnetic field  H(r) 
in the location of the first conductor. This field is

 Both the approaches show that the interaction force of two conductors is the 
result of the interaction of moving charges: some of them excite fields, the others 
interact with them. The immobile charges representing the lattice do not participate 
in the interaction in this scheme. But the forces of the magnetic interaction be-
tween the conductors act just on the lattice. Classical electrodynamics does mot 
explain how the moving charges experiencing this force can transfer it to the lat-
tice.

 The above models of iteration are in unsolvable conflict, and experts in clas-
sical electrodynamics prefer to pass it over in silence. The conflict is connected 
with estimation  of the interaction force of two parallel-moving charges. Within the 
above models such two charges should be attracted. Indeed, the induction  В caused 
by the moving charge g1 at the distance r is

If another charge  g2 moves at the same velocity  V in the same direction at the dis-
tance  r from the first charge, the induction

An immovable observer would expect these charges to experience attraction along 
with the Coulomb repulsion. For an observer moving together with the charges 
there is only the Coulomb repulsion and no attraction. Neither classical electrody-
namics not the special theory of relativity can solve the problem. 
 Physically, the introduction of magnetic fields reflects certain experimental 
facts, but so far we can hardly understand where these fields come from. 

.                                             (2.11) 

It is useful to analyze here the interaction of current-carrying systems in 

terms of Eqs. (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) [4, 5].  
 We come back again to the interaction of two thin conductors with charges 
moving at the velocities  V1 and V2 (Fig. 2.2).

analysis of the interaction forces more convenient, in Fig. 2.2 the systems are sepa-

considered as a sum of four forces specified in Fig. 2.2 (the direction is shown by 
arrows). The attraction forces  F3 and  F4 are positive, and the repulsion forces  F1 
and F2 are negative. 
 According to Eq. (2.1), the forces between the individual charge subsystems 
(Fig. 2.2) are

 It is seen that Eqs. (2.6), (2.9) and (2.13) coincide though they were obtained 
by different methods. 
 According to Feynman [2], the e.m.f. of the circuit can be interpreted using 
two absolutely different laws. The paradox has however been clarified. The force 
of the enteraction between the current-carrying systems can be obtained even by 
three absolutely different methods. But in the third method, the motion “magnetic

of the interaction forces. This was impossible with the previous two techniques. 
 In practice the third method however runs into a serious obstacle. Assuming

charge on the conductor 

.                                              (2.17) 

 When Faraday and Maxwell formulated the basic laws of electrodynamics, it 
was impossible to confirm Eq. (3.17) experimentally because the current densities 
in ordinary conductors are too small to detect the effect. The assumption that the 
charge is independent of its velocity and the subsequent introduction of a magnetic 
field were merely voluntaristic acts. 
 In superconductors the current densities permit us to find the correction for

 experimentally. Initially, [6] was taken as evidence for the de-

pendence of the value of the charge on its velocity. The author of this study has 
also investigated this problem [4,5], but, unlike [6], in his experiments current was 
introduced into a superconducting coil by an inductive non-contact method. Even 
in this case a charge appeared on the coil  [4,5]. The experimental objects were su-
perconducting composite Nb – Ti wires coated with copper, and it is not cleat what 
mechanism is responsible for the charge on the coil. It may be brought by me-
chanical deformation which causes a displacement of the Fermi level in the copper. 
Experiments on non-coated superconducting wires may be more informative. Any-
how, the subject has not been exhausted and further experimental findings are of 
paramount importance to fundamental physics. Using this model, we should re-
member that there is no reliable experimental data on static electric fields around 
the conductor. According to Eq. (2.16), such fields are excited because the value of 
the charge is dependent on its velocity. Is there any physical mechanism which 
could maintain the interacting current-carrying systems electrically neutral within 
this model? Such mechanism  does exist. To explain it, let us consider the current-
carrying circuit in Fig. 2.3. This is a superconducting thin film whose thickness is 
smaller than the field penetration depth in the superconductor. The current is there-
fore distributed uniformly over the film thickness. Assume that the bridge connect-

 

13

(cid:215)
ing the wide parts of the film is much narrower than the rest of the current-carrying 
film. If persistent current is excited in such a circuit, the current density and hence 
the current carrier velocity  V1 in the bridge will much exceed the velocity  V0  in the 
wide parts of the film.  

Such situation is possible if the current carriers are accelerated in the part  d1 

and slowed down in the part   d2. But acceleration and slowing-down of charges is 
possible only in electric fields. If  V1 >  V 0, the potential difference between the 
parts d1 and d2  which causes acceleration or slowing-down is determined as

  .                                            (2.18) 

This potential difference can appear only due to the charge density gradient in the 
parts d1 and d2, i.e. the density of charge carriers decreases with acceleration and 
increases with slowing down. The relation  n0 > n1 should be fulfilled, where  n0 and 
n1 are the current-carrier densities in the wide and narrow bridge parts of the film,

respectively. It is clear that some energy is needed to accelerate charges which 
have masses. Let us find out where this energy comes from. 
 On acceleration the electrostatic energy available in the electrostatic field of 
the current carriers converts into kinetic energy. The difference in electrostatic en-
ergy between two identical volumes having different electron densities can be writ-
ten as

In this case, the contradiction mentioned above is absent. 

 Certainly, the given approach is nonconventional, but it is very evident, 

since it is clearly clear, what forces operate between the charged particles which 
are carrying out mutual movement. Clearly, that the considered forces will lead to 
compression  a cord of the current, and forces of compression will be more, than 
forces of pushing apart.  
          We should note one more circumstance. That density of the electrons  which 
move through a lattice, less, than density motionless of the electrons, specified still 
F.London [7], however, for electrodynamics and this circumstance of greater con-
sequences had no thermodynamics of superconductors, since such amendments are 
very small.  
          However, for plasma, especially in case of pinch-effect when density of cur-
rents can reach greater sizes, this question gets special value. At greater density of 
current the difference of longitudinal density of the electrons and ions can reach 
greater sizes, and it will lead to presence of greater longitudinal electric fields. 
These fields will try to break off a plasma cord in longitudinal  a direction, leading 
a additional instability  about which we earlier did not know.  Thus, the new ap-
proach opens a way not only to the best physical understanding of pinch-effect, but 
also predicts the new phenomena which, certainly, it is necessary to consider at re-
search and practical use of pinch-effect.

          We see that the change in the current-carrier density is quite small, but this 
change is just responsible for the existence of the longitudinal electric field accel-
erating or slowing down the charges in the parts  d1 and  d2. Let us call such fields 
“configuration fields” as they are connected with a certain configuration of the 
conductor. These fields are available in normal conductors too, but they are much 
smaller than the fields related to the Ohmic resistance. 
 We can expect that a voltameter connected to the circuit, like is shown in 
Fig. 2.3, would be capable of registering the configuration potential difference in 
accordance with Eq. (2.18). If we used an ordinary liquid and a manometer instead 
of a voltameter, according to the Bernoulli equation, the manometer could  register 
the pressure difference. For lead films, the configuration potential difference is 
~10-7  В, though it is not observablt experimentally. We can explain this before 
hand. As the velocities of the current carriers increase and their densities decrease, 
the electric fields njrmal to their motion enhance. These two precesses 
counterbalance each other. As a result, the normal component of the electric field 
has a zero balue in all parts of the film. In terms of the considered, this looks like

Again, we have a relation coinciding with Eqs.  (2.6) and (2.9). However, in this

It is seen that two electron flows moving at the same velocity in the absence 
of a lattice experience only the Coulomb repulsion and no attraction included into 
the magnetic field concept. 
 Physically, in this model the force interaction of the current-carrying sys-
tems is not connected with any now field. The interaction is due to the enhance-
ment of the electric fields normal to the direction of the charge motion. 
 The phenomenological concept of the magnetic field of correct only when 
the charges of the current carriers are compensated with the charges of the immo-
bile lattice, the current carriers excite a magnetic field. The magnetic field concept 
is not correct for freely moving charges when there are no compensating charges of 
the lattice. In this case a moving charged particle or a flow of charged particles 
does not excite a magnetic field. Thus, the concept of the phenomenological mag-
netic field is true but for the above case. 

It is easy to show that using the scalar-vector potential, we can obtain all the 

presently existing laws of magnetism. Besides, the approach proposed permits a 
solution of the problem of the interaction between two parallel-moving charges 
which could not be solved in terms of the magnetic field concept.

                                       3. Retarded potentials 
 

Whatever occurs in electrodynamic, it is connected with the interaction of 
moving and immobile charges. The introduction of the scalar-vector potential an-
swers this question. The potential is based on the laws of electromagnetic and 
magnetoelectric induction. The Maxwell equations describing the wave processes 
in material media also follow from these laws. The Maxwell equations suggest that 
the velocity of field propagation is finite and equal to the velocity of light. 
 The problem of electromagnetic radiation can be solved of the elementary 
level using the scalar-vector potential and the finiteness of propagation of electric 
processes. 

For this purpose, the retarded scalar-vector potential

All the problems of radiation can be solved at the elementary level using Eq. (3.4) . 
this equation is also the induction law assuming that the retardation time is very 
short. 
          Now we should write all equations that are necessary for solving existing 
problems of electrodynamics. Relation (3.1) must be supplemented by the wave 
equation for electric fields. To derive the latter, let us write the Maxwell equations 
in the form already known for us

           It is surprising that Eq. (3.1) actually accounts for the whole of electrody-
namics beause all current electrodynamics problems can be solved using this equa-
tion. What is then a magnetic field? This is merely a convenient mathematical pro-
cedure which is not necessarily gives a correct result (e.g., in the case of parallel-
moving charges). Now we can state that electrocurrent, rather than electromag-
netic, waves travel in space. Their electric field and displacement current vectors 
are in the same plane and displaced by  p
 In terms of Eq. (3.1), electrodynamics and optics can be reconstructed com-
pletely to become simpler, more intelligible and obvious.

                                                   media 
 
          It is well known that electric and magnetic inductivities of material media 
can depend on frequency, i.e. they can exhibit dispersion. But even Maxwell him-
self, who was the author of the basic equations of electrodynamics,  believed that 
and m

 were frequency-independent fundamental constants. 
How the idea of  e  and  m -dispersion appeared and evolved is illustrated viv-

e  

idly in the monograph of well-known specialists in physics of plasma [8]: while 
working at the equations of electrodynamics of material, media, G. Maxwell 
looked upon electric and magnetic inductivities as constants (that is why this ap-
proach was so lasting). Much later, at the beginning of the XX century, G. 
Heavisidr and R.Wull put forward their explanation for phenomena of optical dis-
persion (in particular rainbow) in which electric and magnetic inductivities came as 
functions of frequency. Quite recently, in the mid-50ies of the last century, physi-
cists arrived at the conclusion that these parameters were dependent not only on the 
frequency but on the wave vector as well. That was a revolutionary breakaway 
from the current concepts. The importance of the problem is clearly illustrated by 
what happened at a seminar held by L. D. Landau in 1954, where he interrupted A. 
L. Akhiezer reporting on the subject: “Nonsense, the refractive index cannot be a 
function of the refractive index”. Note, this was said by L. D. Landau, an out-
standing physicist of our time.  

What is the actual situation? Running ahead, I can admit that Maxwell was  
 are frequency – independent constants characterizing one or an-

right: both e  and m
other material medium. Since dispersion of electric and magnetic inductivities of 
material media is one of the basic problems of the present – day physics and elec-
trodynamics, the system of views on these questions has to be radically altered 
again (for the second time!). 

In this context the challenge of this study was to provide a comprehensive 

answer to the above questions and thus to arrive at a unified and unambiguous 
standpoint. This will certainly require a revision of the relevant interpretations in 
many fundamental works.

           It is noted that dispersion of electric and magnetic inductivities of  material 
media is a commonly accepted idea. The idea is however not correct. 

To explain this statement and to gain a better understanding of the physical 

essence of the problem, we start with a simple example showing how electric 
lumped-parameter circuits can be described. As we can see below, this example is 
directly concerned with the problem of our interest and will give us a better insight 
into the physical picture of  the electrodynamic processes in material media.

larly to    C*(w) and  L*(w), characterize completely the electrodynamic properties 
of plasma. The case

corresponds to the resonance of current. 
 It is shown below that under certain conditions this resonance can be trans-
verse with respect to the direction of electromagnetic waves. 

It is known that the Langmuir resonance is longitudinal. No other resonances 
have ever been detected in nonmagnetized plasma. Nevertheless, transverse 
resonance is also possible in such plasma, and its frequency coincides with that 
of the Langmuir resonance. To understand the origin of the transverse reso-
nance, let us consider a long line consisting of two perfectly conducting planes 
(see Fig. 4.1). First, we examine this line in vacuum.

garded as an equivalent circuit (Fig. 4.2 а).

Earlier, we introduced this magnitude by another way (see Eq. (4.21)). 

Eq. (4.55) corresponds to case of uniformly distributed d.c. current. 

As we can see from Eq. (4.54),  LHS , unlike  CЕS and  LkS , decreases when  z 

grows. This is clear physically because the number of parallel-connected inductive 
elements increases with growing  z.  The equivalent circuit of the line with nondis-
sipative plasma is shown in Fig. 4.2

 is the velocity of light in vacuum. 

For the plasma under consideration, the phase velocity of the electromag-
netic wave is equal to infinity. Hence, the distribution of the fields and currents 
over the line is uniform at each instant of time and independent of the  z-coordinate. 
This implies that, on the one hand, the inductance  LHS has no effect on the electro-
dynamic processes in the line and, on the other hand, any two planes can be used 
instead of conducting planes to confine plasma above and below.  

Eqs. (4.58) , (4.59) and (4.60) indicate that we have transverse resonance 

 0 and the transverse wave is propagating in the line along the direction 

with an infinite  Q-factor. The fact of transverse resonance, i.e. different from the 
Langmuir resonance, is most obvious when the  Q-factor is not equal to infinity. 
Then  kz „
perpendicular to the movement of charge carriers. True, we started our analysis 
with plasma confined within two planes of a long line, but we have thus found that 
the presence of such resonance is entirely independent of the line size, i.e. this 
resonance can exist in an infinite medium. Moreover, in infinite plasma transverse 
resonance can coexist with the Langmuir resonance characterizing longitudinal 
waves. Since the frequencies of these resonances coincide, both of them are degen-
erate. Earlier, the possibility of transverse resonance was not considered. To ap-
proach the problem more comprehensively, let us analyze the energy processes in 
loss-free plasma. 

The characteristic resistance of plasma determining the relation between the 

transverse components of electric and magnetic fields can be found from

Thus, the energy accumulated in the magnetic field is 

 times lower than 

that in the electric field. This traditional electrodynamic analysis is however not 
complete because it disregards one more energy component – the kinetic energy of 
charge carriers. It turns out that in addition to the electric and magnetic waves car-
rying electric and magnetic energy, there is one more wave in plasma – the kinetic 
wave carrying the kinetic energy of charge carriers. The specific energy of this 
wave is

Hence, to find the total specific energy accumulated in unit volume of plasma, it is 
not sufficient to allow only for the fields  Е and Н.

                    WE = Wk  , 

i.e. there is no magnetic field in the plasma, and the plasma is a macroscopic elec-
tromechanical cavity resonator of frequency  wr.. 

At w >  wr the wave propagating in plasma carries three types of energy – 

magnetic, electric and kinetic. Such wave can therefore be-called magnetoelec-

trokinetic. The kinetic wave is a current-density wave 

. It is shifted 

by p /2 with respect to the electric wave. 

Up to now we have considered a physically unfeasible case with no losses in 
plasma, which corresponds to infinite  Q-factor of the plasma resonator. If losses 
occur, no matter what physical processes caused them, the  Q-factor of the plasma 
resonator is a final quantity. For this case the Maxwell equations become

The term  sр.ef E
emphasizes that we are interested in the fact of loss and do not care of its mecha-
nism. Nevertheless, even though we do not try to analyze the physical mechanism

For this purpose, we choose a line segment of the length 

z0 which is much 

shorter than the wavelength in dissipative plasma. This segment is equivalent to a

the charges are not bound and their displacement would not produce any extra 
electrostatic energy. This is especially obvious if we employ the induction tech-
nique to induce current (i.e. to displace charges) in a ring conductor. In this case 
there is no restoring force to act upon the charges, hence, no electric polarization is 
possible. In  [9] the polarization vector found from Eq. (4.78) is introduced into the 
electric induction of conducting media

cal phenomena in plasma, which first of all include the transverse plasma reso-
nance and three energy components of the magnetoelectrokinetic wave propagating 
in plasma. 

Below, the practical aspects of the results obtained are analyzed, which 

promise new data and refinement of the current views.  

Plasma can be used first of all to construct a macroscopic single-frequency 
cavity for development of a new class of electrokinetic plasma lasers. Such cavity 
can also operate as a band-pass filter.  
 At high enough 
pQ  the magnetic field energy near the transverse resonance 
is considerably lower than the kinetic energy of the current carriers and the electro-
static field energy. Besides, under certain conditions the phase velocity can much 
exceed the velocity of light. Therefore, if we want to excite the transverse plasma 
resonance, we can put

 Transverse plasma resonance offers another important application – it can be 
used to heat plasma. High-level electric fields and, hence, high change-carrier en-
ergies can be obtained in the plasma resonator if its 
Q-factor is high, which is 
achievable at low concentrations of plasma. Such cavity has the advantage that the 
charges attain the highest velocities far from cold planes. Using such charges for 
nuclear fusion, we can keep the process far from the cold elements of the resona-
tor. 
 Such plasma resonator can be matched easily to the communication line. In-
deed, the equivalent resistance of the resonator at the point  w = wр  is

The communication lines of sizes  аL and bL should be connected to the cavity ei-
ther through a smooth junction or in a stepwise manner. If   b = b L, the matching 
requirement is

Such plasma resonators can be excited with d.c. current, as is the case with a 
monotron microwave oscillator [11]. It is known that a microwave diode (the 
plasma resonator in our case) with the transit angle of ~5/2 p
sistance and tends to self-excitation. The requirement of the transit angle equal to 
5/2p

 correlates with the following d.c. voltage applied to the resonator:

4.2.  Dielectric media. 
 

 Applied fields cause polarization of bound charges in dielectrics. The polari-
zation takes some energy from the field source, and the dielectric accumulates ex-
tra electrostatic energy. The extent of displacement of the polarized charges from 
the equilibrium is dependent on the electric field and the coefficient of elasticity 
characterizing the elasticity of the charge bonds. These parameters are related as

 and see immediately that the vibrating charges of the dielec-

tric have masses and thus possess inertia properties. As a result, their kinetic induc-

and the dielectric behaves just like plasma. This case has prompted the idea that at 
high frequencies there is no difference between dielectrics and plasma. The idea 
served as a basis for introducing the polarization vector in conductors [9]. The dif-
ference however exists and it is of fundamental importance. In dielectrics, because 
of inertia, the amplitude of charge vibrations is very small at high frequencies and 
so is the polarization vector. The polarization vector is always zero in conductors.

and the permittivity of the dielectric is independent of frequency. It is 

times higher than in vacuum. This result is quite clear. At  w >> w0 the inertia prop-
erties are 

 
inactive and permittivity approaches its value in the static field. 
          The equivalent circuits corresponding to these two cases are shown in  
Figs. 4.3а and b. It is seen that in the whole range of frequencies the equivalent ci  
cuit of the dielectric acts as a series oscillatory circuit parallel-connected to the ca-
pacitor operating due to the electric inductivity   e0 of vacuum (see Fig. 4.3b). The  
resonance frequency of this series circuit is obviously obtain from

omit this here to save room. 
 

4.3.  Magnetic media. 
 

The resonance phenomena in plasma and dielectrics are characterized by repeated 
electrostatic-kinetic and kinetic-electrostatic transformations of the charge motion 
energy during oscillations. This can be described as an electrokinetic process, and 
devices based on it (lasers, masers, filters, etc.) can be classified as electrokinetic 
units. 

However, another type of resonance is also possible, namely, magnetic reso-
nance. Within the current concepts of frequency-dependent permeability, it is easy 
to show that such dependence is related to magnetic resonance. For example, let us 
consider ferromagnetic resonance. A ferrite magnetized by applying a stationary 
field    Н0 parallel to the  z-axis will act as an anisotropic magnet in relation to the 
variable external field. The complex permeability of this medium has the form of a 
tensor [12]:

 Thus, it has been found that along with the fundamental parameters

0 characterizing the electric and magnetic energy accumulated and transferred in 
the medium, there are two more basic material parameters  Lk and Ck. They charac-
terize kinetic and potential energy that can be accumulated and transferred in mate-

rial media.  Lk was sometimes used to describe certain physical phenomena, for ex-
ample, in superconductors [13],  Ck has never been known to exist. These four fun-
damental parameters  e
0,  Lk and  Ck clarify the physical picture of the wave 
and resonance processes in material media in applied electromagnetic fields. Pre-
viously, only electromagnetic waves were thought to propagate and transfer energy 
in material media. It is clear now that the concept was not complete. In fact, mag-
netoelectrokinetic, or electromagnetopotential waves travel in material media. The 
resonances in these media also have specific features. Unlike closed planes with 
electromagnetic resonance and energy exchange between electric and magnetic 
fields, material media have two types of resonance – electrokinetic and mag-
netopotential. Under the electrokinetic resonsnce the energy of the electric field 
changes to kinetic energy. In the case of magnetopotential resonance the potential 
energy accumulated during the precessional motion can escape outside at the pre-
cession frequency. 

The notions of permittivity and permeability dispersion thus become physi-

 are handy for a mathematical description

tion of the scalar-vector potential is demonstrated here more clearly.

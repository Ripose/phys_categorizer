Abstract 

The  influence  of  oxygen  and  carbon  impurities  on  the  concentrations  of  defects  in  silicon  for  detector 
uses, in complex fields of radiation (proton cosmic field at low orbits around the Earth, at Large Hadron 
Collider  and  at  the  next  generation  of  accelerators  as  Super-LHC)  is  investigated  in  the  frame  of  the 
quantitative  model  developed  previously  by  the  authors.  The  generation  rate  of  primary  defects  is 
calculated starting from the projectile - silicon interaction and from recoil energy redistribution in the 
lattice.  The  mechanisms  of  formation  of  complex  defects  are  explicitly  analysed.  Vacancy-interstitial 
annihilation,  interstitial  and  vacancy  migration  to  sinks,  divacancy,  vacancy  and  interstitial  impurity 
complex formation and decomposition are considered. Oxygen and carbon impurities present in silicon 
could  monitor  the  concentration  of  all  stable  defects,  due  to  their  interaction  with  vacancies  and 
interstitials.  Their  role  in  the  mechanisms  of  formation  and  decomposition  of  the  following  stable 
defects:  VP,  VO,  V2,  V2O,  Ci,  CiOi  and  CiCs  is  studied.  The  model  predictions  could  be  a  useful  clue  in 
obtaining harder materials for detectors at the new generation of accelerators, for space missions or for 
industrial applications. 

Keywords: silicon, detectors, radiation damage, defect kinetics and impurities dependence

1. Introduction 

Silicon-based  devices  have  found  applications  in  a  wide  variety  of  hostile  radiation  environments. 
For  this  reason,  radiation  effects  in  silicon  represent  a  research  field  that  have  received  extensive 
attention,  in  order  to  assess  the  performances  of  silicon  to  radiation.  In  the  next  future,  silicon 
detectors will be used for many applications in particle or astroparticle physics as, for example, at the 
CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Super-LHC (S-LHC) or in space mission as, e.g. the Anti-
Matter  Spectrometer  (AMS).  The  detectors  used  in  these  environments  will  be  exposed  long-time 
and/or  to  high  fluences  of  charged  and  neutral  particles.  Various  systematic  studies  have  been 
performed to understand better the origins and consequences of radiation damage in silicon detectors. 
These cover the production of primary defects [1], their annealing mechanisms [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], 
[7],  [8],  the  correlation  with  the  characteristics  of  the  irradiation  particle  [9],  [10],  [11]  and  with 
initial  material  impurities  [12],  [13].  The  microscopic  modifications  of  the  material  characteristics 
produce changes in the detector parameters. The microscopic phenomena and their consequences at 
the device level are still poorly understood.  

In the last decade a lot of studies have been done to investigate the influence of different impurities, 
especially  oxygen  and  carbon,  as  possible  ways  to  enhance  the  radiation  hardness  of  silicon  for 
detectors  in  the  future  generation  of  experiments  in  high  energy  physics  -  see,  e.g.  references  [14] 
and  [15].  These  impurities  added  to  the  silicon  bulk  modify  the  formation  of  electrically  active 
defects,  thus  control  the  macroscopic  device  parameters.  The  model  developed  previously  by  the 
authors  [16],  [17],  [18]  and  used  in  the  present  paper  confirms  these  conclusions.  The  correlation 
established by the model between the initial material parameters, the rate of defect generation in the 
continuous irradiation regime, the production of defects and their time annealing, could be a useful 
clue in obtaining harder materials for detectors. 

2. Macroscopic damage in silicon 

Most semiconductor radiation detectors are based on the properties of the p-n diode junction. During 
irradiation,  due  to  the  collisions  of  the  incident  particle  with  the  nuclei  placed  in  the  sites  of  the 
lattice, as well as due to the re-arrangement of the corresponding recoils, vacancies and interstitials, 
primary radiation defects, are generated. Consequences of irradiation processes, some characteristics 
of  the  devices  are  modified  because  of  the  formation  of  secondary  defects.  Some  of  them  are 
electrically  active,  with  energy  levels  located  in  the  forbidden  band  gap,  that  act  either  as  capture 
centres,  or  as  generation  –  recombination  ones.  The  principal  effects  are:  bulk  material  resistivity 
modification,  change  of  depletion  voltage,  increase  of  leakage  current,  change  of  electric  field 
distribution in irradiated silicon p-n junction, decrease of the collection efficiency and decrease of the 
signal to noise ratio. [19], [20], [21]. 

Silicon  used  in  high  energy  physics  detectors  is  n-type  high  resistivity  (1  ÷  6  KΩcm)  phosphorus 
doped FZ material. The concentrations of interstitial oxygen and substitutional carbon in silicon are 
strongly  dependent  on  the  growth  technique.  In  high  purity  Float  Zone  Si,  the  concentrations  of 
interstitial  oxygen  are  around  1015  cm-3,  while  in  the  oxygenation  technique  developed  at  BNL,  an 
interstitial oxygen concentration of the order 5x1017 cm-3 is obtained. These materials can be enriched 
in substitutional carbon. 

 

 

3. Radiation environments considered in the present analysis 

In  the  present  paper,  two types  of  applications.  In  the  first  class  of  applications,  the  radiation  field 
produced by cosmic rays is considered, for orbits in the neighbourhood of the Earth, at an altitude of 
about 380 km, where the dominant particles are the protons. Considering the flux spectra measured 
by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) during space shuttle flight STS-91F [22], a differential 
generation rate of vacancy-interstitial pairs of 2 x 102 VI pairs/cm3/s has been calculated [23]. The 
energetic differential generation rate has been calculated as the integral of the convoluted spectrum of 
the measured flux and of the energy dependence of the concentration of primary defects (CPD) for 
proton irradiation.  

The second application is represented by the radiation field in the region of tracker detectors at the 
LHC  accelerator,  as  well  as  to  the  new  generation  of  accelerators,  as  S-LHC.  Without  loss  of 
generality, the radiation field simulated for the CMS silicon tracker geometry [24] is considered in 
the following calculations. The spectra of charged hadrons (pions, kaons and protons) simulated for 
the positions of the silicon layers are taken from reference [24]. The hadrons are predominantly low-
energy charged pions and protons, which are present in different amounts and have different energy 
spectra as a function of the distance in respect to the interaction point, and of the pseudorapidity. In 
all cases, the pions are the dominant particles. The energetic differential generation rates of defects 
have  been  calculated  similarly  as  in  the  first  case.  The  range  of  generation  rates  (considering  the 
extreme  positions  in  the  tracker  detector)  are:  6.2  x  108  VI  pairs/cm3/s  for  pions  and  5.6  x  107  VI 
pairs/cm3/s  for  protons,  and  8.1  x  106  VI  pairs/cm3/s  and  3.1  x  106  VI  pairs/cm3/s  for  pions  and 
protons  respectively.  This  represents  nearly  seven  orders  of  magnitude  higher  generation  rate  in 
respect  to  the  field  of  the  cosmic  rays  in  the  near  Earth  orbit.  A  ten  fold  increase  in  LHC  design 
luminosity (at S-LHC [25]) is planned, reflected in an increase of the dose in the central region, and 
corresponding to a ten times increase of the generation rate of primary defects. 

4. Modelling of radiation effects 

The primary incident particle, having kinetic energy with values in the intermediate up to high energy 
range, interacts with the semiconductor material. After this process, the recoil nuclei resulting from 
these interactions lose their energy in the lattice. Their energy partition between displacements and 

ionisation is considered in accord with the Lindhard theory [26] and authors' contributions [27] and 
after this step the concentration of primary defects is calculated. The basic assumption of the present 
model is that the primary defects, vacancies and interstitials, are produced in equal quantities and are 
uniformly  distributed  in  the  material  bulk.  They  are  produced  by  the  incoming  particle,  as  a 
consequence  of  the  subsequent  collisions  of  the  primary  recoil  in  the  lattice,  or  thermally.  The 
generation term (G) is the sum of two components: GR accounting for the generation by irradiation, 
and GT, for thermal generation. The concentration of the primary radiation induced defects per unit 
fluence  (CPD)  in  silicon  has  been  calculated  as  the  sum  of  the  concentrations  of  defects  resulting 
from  all  interaction  processes,  and  all  characteristic  mechanisms  corresponding  to  each  interaction 
process, using the explicit formula from reference [27] (see also concrete relations and details). Due 
to the important weight of annealing processes, as well as to their very short time scale, CPD is not a 
direct measurable physical quantity.  

In  silicon,  vacancies  and  interstitials  are  essentially  unstable  and  interact  via  migration, 
recombination,  and  annihilation  or  produce  other  defects.  In  some  previous  papers  (see,  e.g.  refs. 
[16],  [17],  [18]),  the  authors  developed  a  quantitative  phenomenological  model  to  explain  the 
production  of  primary  defects  and  their  time  evolution  toward  stable  defects,  starting  from  silicon 
with  different  quantities  of  initial  impurities,  considering  different  rates  of  primary  defects 
production  and  conditions  of  irradiation.  Without  free  parameters,  the  model  is  able  to  predict  the 
absolute values of the concentrations of defects and their time evolution toward stable defects. 

In the chemical reaction description, the formation and evolution of defects in silicon, around room 
temperature, could be described as follows:

The  reaction  constants  Ki  (i  =  1,  4  ÷  16)  have  the  general  form:  Ki  =  C·ν·exp(-Ei/kBT),  with ν  the 
vibration frequency of the lattice, Ei the associated activation energy and C a numerical constant that 
accounts for the symmetry of the defect in the lattice. The reaction constant related to the migration 
of  interstitials  and  vacancies  to  sinks  could  be  expressed  as:  Kj  =  αj·ν·λ2·exp(-Ej/kBT),  with  j  =  2 
(interstitials) and 3 (vacancies), αj:- the sink concentration and λ - the jump distance. 

The values of the activation energies are from the literature see for example reference [18]. 

The reactions are grouped into four categories: the first is related only to primary defects and their 
reciprocal interactions (equations 1 and 2); the second involves the reactions of primary defects with 
impurities,  as  well  as  complex  decomposition  (equations  3,  4  and  5),  while  the  interactions  of 
complexes,  and  of  complexes  with  primary  defects  are  comprised  into  the  group  of  reactions

represented by equations 6. Complexes of other impurities with primary defects could also be added 
to this reaction scheme.  
In  the  analysis  which  follows,  four  types  of  Oxygen  and  Carbon  doping  have  been  considered  for 
high  resistivity  silicon  (1014  cm-3  Phosphorus):  2x1015  O/cm3,  3x1015  C/cm3;  4x1017  O/cm3,  3x1015 
C/cm3; 2x1015 O/cm3, 6x1017 C/cm3; and  4x1017 O/cm3, 6x1017 C/cm3. 

In  Figure  1,  the  time  evolution  of  the  primary  defects  in  the  conditions  of  10  years  of  continuous 
irradiation  specified  before  is  presented.  The  time  evolutions  of  the  concentrations  of  complexes 
defects: V2, VP and V2O, relevant for modifications of device parameters are represented in the same 
conditions (doping and irradiation) in Figure 2.

Figure 1 
Time  dependence  of  the  concentrations  of  (top  to  bottom):  vacancies  and  interstitials  in  conditions  of 
continuous  irradiation  (left    to  right)  cosmic,  LHC  and  Super-LHC,  for  silicon  with  1014  cm-3  P,  with  the 
following concentrations of Oxygen and Carbon: 2x1015 O/cm3, 3x1015 C/cm3 - curve (1), 4x1017 O/cm3, 3x1015 
C/cm3 - curve (2), 2x1015 O/cm3, 6x1017 C/cm3 - curve (3), 4x1017 O/cm3, 6x1017 C/cm3 - curve (4). 

At low rates of generation of primary defects, due to the greater mobility of interstitials in respect to 
vacancies,  the  interstitial  concentration  remains  constant  in  time,  and  independent  on  the 
concentration  of  impurities.  In  the  extreme  case  of  S-LHC  conditions,  before  about  three  years  of 
continuous  irradiation,  for  materials  with  high  concentration  of  oxygen,  some  possible  processes 
initiated by interstitials are favoured, due to the .relatively high concentration of interstitials present 
in  the  sample.  After  longer  times,  the  peculiarities  of  different  materials  are  lost  and  the 
concentrations  of  vacancies  and  interstitials  remain  practically  constant  in  time.  For  an  order  of 
magnitude  lower  generation  rate  of  primary  defects,  the  particularities  of  material  doping  are 
relevant.  

Ci,  is  highly  mobile  at  room  temperature  and  Cs  can  be  considered  immobile.  By  a  kick-out 
mechanism  [28],  substitutional  carbon  can  be  transformed  into  an  interstitial  defect.  Interstitial 
oxygen  acts  as  a  sink  for  vacancies,  thus  reducing  the  probability  of  formation  of  complexes, 
associated  with  deeper  levels  inside  the  gap.  Oxygen  addition  produces  a  dramatic  decrease  of 
vacancy  concentration  in  all  generation  conditions,  because  oxygen  fixes  vacancies  in  the  form  of 
VO and V2O complexes. The most pronounced is this effect in lean carbon silicon (curve 2). In what 
regards the concentration of interstitials, oxygen addition keeps a higher concentration in the sample 
(curves 2 and 4) because more vacancies are fixed by oxygen, favouring this way the formation of 
interstitial  –  impurity  complexes.  Due  to  the  competitive  processes,  the  effects  are  different  for 

different generation rates, being the most pronounced for S-LHC conditions. A remarkable point is 
that  in  these  conditions,  after  approximately  three  years  of  operation,  both  interstitial  and  vacancy 
concentrations attain a plateau.

Figure 2 
Time dependence of the concentrations of(top to bottom): V2, VP and V2O defects in conditions of continuous 
irradiation for ten years for (left to right): cosmic, LHC and Super-LHC, for silicon with 1014 cm-3 P, with the 
following concentrations of Oxygen and Carbon: 2x1015 O/cm3, 3x1015 C/cm3 - curve (1), 4x1017 O/cm3, 3x1015 
C/cm3 - curve (2), 2x1015 O/cm3, 6x1017 C/cm3 - curve (3), 4x1017 O/cm3, 6x1017 C/cm3 - curve (4). 

In conditions of cosmic irradiation, a clear distinction is seen between silicon with low concentration 
of oxygen (curves (1) and (3)), and silicon –rich material (curves (2) and (4)), while the concentration 
of carbon does not matter. At much higher irradiation rates (LHC and S-LHC), both the content of 
oxygen and of carbon is very important: For the LHC case, the highest concentration of divavacies 
and vacancy-phosphorous complexes are found in low oxygen, high carbon concentration material, 
correlated  with  the  high  concentration  of  vacancies  calculated  (see  Figure  1),  while  for  the  V2O 
complex,  oxygen  enrichment  is  essential  (curves  (2)  and  (4)).  At  even  higher  radiation  rates,  the 
hierarchy  is  maintained.  The  remarkable  point  here  is  that  V,  I,  VP  and  V2O  concentration  are 
saturating for all types of materials studied, all of them after the same amount of time for the same 
material, while all the generated vacancies are found in the increase of the V2 concentration.  

Conclusions 

In the frame of an original phenomenological model developed previously by the authors, the role of 
oxygen and carbon impurities in the mechanisms of formation and the kinetics of the following stable 

defects: VP, VO, V2, V2O, Ci, CiOi and CiCs in silicon for detector uses, in complex fields of radiation 
has been investigated. The obtained results, presented and discussed in the paper, could be a useful 
clue  in  obtaining  harder  materials  for  detectors  at  the  new  generation  of  accelerators,  for  space 
missions or for industrial applications.

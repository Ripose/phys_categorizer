Abstract

The   double   diffraction   of   white   light   can   produce   a   thin-prism-like   image   in   certain 
conditions by using ordinary diffraction gratings. The diffractive deviation of rays happens 
mainly   in   one   direction   because   the   diffracting   elements   are   straight   and   parallel.   We 
show similar images using elements where diffraction happens in both directions: spiral 
grooves   discs.   Some   differences   between   the   straight-groove   and   the   almost   circular 
curved-groove cases are described.

1. Introduction

White-light   double   diffracted   imaging   was   demonstrated   in   cases   where   a   pinhole 
intermediated  the   diffraction  path   [1,2].  Imaging   without   any  intermediate  element  was 
showed   in   a   previous   article   [3]  with   second   order   diffraction   on   a   first   grating   being 

collected to perform the first order diffraction by a second similar grating.  This prism-like 
white-light   image   is   even   more   chromatically   correct   than   a   prism   image.   The   image 
conditions   depends   on   the   relationship   between   the   gratings   distance   and   the   object 
distance.   All   diffracted   rays   are   in   the   same   plane,   it   is   not   obvious   that   the   same 
properties may arise in case of curved grooves . To test the possibility of imaging in the 
case of curved grooves we employed two spiral gratings within the same diffraction order 
relationship to try to form a similar situation. Because the curvature of the grooves made 
light to converge at a shorter distance than in our previous experiment we tried to find 
imaging with shorter distance between elements, varying the distance between diffracting 
elements until finding a satisfactory result [4,5]. 

2. Description

A white-light object is positioned in front of a spiral diffracting element, which groove is 
centered   to   one   side   as   in  Figure   1,   where   the   center   of   curvature   of  the   groove   is 
indicated. 

Figure 1: schematic drawing of the double diffraction imaging setup.

Only a part smaller than a quart of a complete spiral disc is employed. That is why the 
center of curvature is outside the diffracting element. The second diffracted order directed 
to the side of the center of curvature is collected at a certain distance by a second spiral 
diffracting element. A perpendicular to the diffracting elements through the center of one 
element gives a centering line for both.  The deviation direction of the second diffraction is 
opposite  to that of the  first  diffraction,  giving  a light  field  corresponding  to  a divergent 
image of the object.
The same ray tracing scheme of our previous article [3] can be employed to give a first 
primary explanation of the image formation. It is shown in Figure 2 and describes the main 
orientation of the diffracted light for rays that impinge perpendicularly to the tangent of the 
groove profile on the first diffracting element.

The diffraction of these rays impinge the second diffracting element in a way that keeps 
the plane of propagation after the second diffraction. A sequence of propagation planes 
can then be assumed to happen, containing the centering line and all of them performing 
images in the same way as ordinary gratings did [3]. Although this explanation does not 
include   the   case   of   rays   that   impinge   in   other   directions,   that   is,   we   are   excluding   to 
consider   conical   diffraction,   we   believe   that   our   first   approach   is   a   good   way   to   start 
analyzing the phenomena.

3. Experimental details

A sector of less than one quarter of a compact (CD) data disc made of a single spiral 
groove was employed for the first diffracting element, and a similar one for the second. 
We name “grooves”  the different appearences of this groove in a radial direction. The 
number of grooves per milimeter was 658. The object was a flashlight with a vertical arrow 
pointing upwards positioned at 15.5 cm in front of the first element  The second diffracting 
element was at a distance of 9.0  cm.  Figure 3 is a color photograph of the setup as seen 
from above, with the flashlight to the left and the two diffracting discs to the right.

Figure 4 shows the setup from behind, in a viewpoint very close to the flashlight. It allows 
to see the circular holes on the first and second black holders of the diffracting discs, 
showing that only a small part of each disc is being employed.

Figure 5 shows the object in a frontal view and to its right appears the image showing the 
arrow   vertically   inverted.   The   same   image   in   gray   tonality   was   added   to   the   right   to 
improve   the   quality.   Because   we   did   not   succeed   to   photograph   at   the   best   possible 
position, a color blurring appeared.

An interesting fact appears when comparing this experience with our previous one [1]: the 

depth of field for the object is almost complete, no limitations were found and it was even 
possible to observe scenes far away from the system.

4. Conclusions

We showed that it is possible to produce prism-like double diffracted white-light images 

when diffraction happens at different planes according to the inclination of spiral grooves. 
The differences with the straight-grooves case can be observed in the inversion up-down 
of the image. Some reduction in sharpness and a very extended longitudinal field of view 
was noticed.

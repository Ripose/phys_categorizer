ABSTRACT 

First princip les calculations based on hybrid density functional theory  have been 

used to  study the electronic and geometric properties of armchair silicon and germanium 

nanotubes ranging from A (3, 3) through A (9, 9). The approach used is the finite cluster 

approach  with hydrogen  termination  to  simulate  the  effects  of  longer  tubes.  A  detailed 

comparison of the structures and stabilities of Si and Ge nanotubes  has been performed 

and  the  dependence  of  the  HOMO- LUMO  or “band”  gaps  on  the  tube  diameters  has 

been  investigated.  Silicon  nanotubes  appear  to  be  “less-puckered”  and  more  stable 

compared  to  germanium  nanotubes.  The  largest  silicon  nanotube  studied  has  a  cohesive 

energy  of  3.138eV/atom  to  be  compared  with  the  cohesive  energy  of  2.770eV/atom  for 

the  corresponding  germanium  nanotube.  Contrary  to  some  published  results  in  the 

literature,  silicon  nanotubes  do  not  appear  to  be  metallic  for  the  cases  studied  in  the 

armchair configuration.

1. Introduction 

  

Discovery and synthesis of  the  “buckyball”  C60 in the early 1990’s led scientists 

towards a new miracle material called  carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which are thin tubes of 

carbon  atoms.1,2    With  the  tremendous  success  of  CNTs,  over  the  years  quasi-one-

dimensional  nanostructures  such  as  nanotubes  and  nanowires  have  stirred  extensive 

interests  in  condensed  matter  physics  and  in  fact,  the  entire  research  world,  partly 

because of their  fascinating  electronic  and  mechanical  properties and  partly because of 

novel  technological  applications.3-11  Single  walled  nanotubes  particularly  have  been 

studied  more  extensively  both  experimentally  and  theoretically.  One  interesting  fact 

observed  both  experimentally and  theoretically  in  the  case of  carbon  nanotubes  is  that 

single  walled  carbon  nanotubes  are  believed  to  exhibit  metallic  or  semiconducting 

behavior  depending  on  the  tube  diameter  and  chirality.  Length  and  curvature  also  are 

found to influence the structure and energetics of a nanotube.12-16  

Continuing  the  extensive  studies  and  applications  of  CNTs,  synthesis of  several 

other  nanotubes  with  different  materials  have  been  reported,  for  example,  NiCl,  NiCl2, 

H2Ti3O3,  and  TiO2.17-19    Theoretical  studies  on  GaN, GaSe,  P,  and  Cu  nano tubes  have  

also  been  reported.20-23  In  this  area,  silicon,  the  workhorse  of  semiconductor  industry, 

occupies a central place.  Research in recent years  have underscored the importance and 

development of silicon at nanoscale. Nano-silicon is believed to be  a potential candidate 

for diverse applications such as creating better disease detectors and biochemical sensors, 

as  well  as  tiny  electronics  such  as  ultra-high  density  memory  chips  for  ultra  fast 

computing. Silicon nanotubes  have  received  much attention,  followed by  two successful 

3

attempts  to  synthesize  them.  Sha  et  al.24  prepared  Si  nanotubes  by  chemical  vapor 

deposition (CVD) process  using nanochannel Al2O3 (NCA) substrate.  Recently, Jeong et 

al.25  reported  synthesis  of  SiNTs  on  porous  alumina  using  molecular  beam  epitaxy 

(MBE).  

Following this line of advances in the periodic table, we note that germanium is 

an  element  in the same column  IV  of  the  periodic table  just  below  silicon.  As known 

already,  there  is  a  stark  similarity  between  bulk  silicon  and  germanium regarding  their 

structural  and  electronic  properties.  They  both  usually  form  diamond- like  3D  structures 

with tetrahedrally coordinated sp3 hybridized atoms. Studies also have shown similarities 

between  germanium  and  silicon  clusters  supported  by  experimental  results.26,27  In 

principle,  since  carbon  nanotubes  exist,  there  is  no  academic  reason  to  doubt  the 

existence  of  silicon  and  germanium  nanotubes.    We  do  hasten  to  point  out  that  no 

experimental detection of germanium nanotubes has been reported  yet. Part of the reason 

for CNTs is attributed to sp2 bonding preferred by  carbon.  But,  if  graphene- like sheets of 

silicon  and  germanium  can  be  formed,  rolled  nanotubes  are  possible.  Contrary  to  the 

popular belief that nanotubes of elemental silicon or germa nium are difficult to stabilize 

owing  to  the  preference  for  sp3 hybridization  these tubes can,  in principle, be stabilized 

by proper termination of dangling bonds on the open ends of the tubes.   

 

There  are,  in  general,  two  approaches  for  constructions  of  nanotubes.  One 

approach is called the “cluster-stacking approach” in which member rings of Si or Ge are 

stacked on top of each other to form a tubular structure and another approach  is “cluster-

CNT based”, which comprises of rolling a graphene- like sheet of Si or Ge to form a tube. 

Seifert et al.28 proposed silicon based tubular nanostructures by rolling the (Si-H) silicide 

4

sheets  to  form  Si- H nanotubes.  They  concluded  that,  silicide  and  SiH  nanotubes  have 

semi-conducting  gaps, independent of chirality, which converged rapidly with increasing 

diameter  to  that  of  the  2D  layer.  Based  on  stability  considerations  compared  to  CNT’s, 

they argued that the synthesis of silicide as well as SiHNTs could be achieved.  Fagan et 

al.29  did  a  comparative  LDA-DFT  (local  density  approximation  to  density  functional 

theory)  study  of  the  electronic,  the  structural,  and  thermal  properties  of  three  infinite 

silicon  nanotubes  (SiNTs), namely armchair (6, 6),  zigzag  (6, 0), and mixed  chiral (8, 2) 

structures.  They  found  that,  similar  to  carbon  nanotubes,  silicon  nanotubes  may  present 

metallic  (armchair)  or  semiconductor  (zigzag  and  mixed)  behaviors,  depending  on  their 

chiralities.  The  gap  was  found  to  decrease  in  inverse  proportion  to  the  diameter.  They 

also performed a Monte-Carlo simulation study using the Tersoff’’s potential and found 

the  existence  of  relevant  discrepancies  regarding  the  thermal  stabilities  and  energy 

differences between cohesive energies per atom for  C and Si  tubes compared with their 

corresponding bulks.  Zhang  et  al.30  used  the  semi-empirical  molecular  orbital  theory 

PM3  and  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  theory  with  two  different  basis  sets,  namely  3-21G  and  3-

21G(d),  to  stud y  four  models,  a  silicon  nanowire  (SiNW),  a  silicon  nanotube  (SiNT),  a 

carbon nanowire  (CNW) and a carbon  nanotube  (CNT).These  studies  showed  that at the 

HF level, results are very sensitive to the basis set used and  silicon tubular structures are 

less stable compared  to their carbon counterparts. However under appropriate conditions 

silicon  nanotubes  with  puckered  surface  structures are possible.  Zhang  et  al.31 studied 

three structures of finite SiNT’s at B3LYP/6-31G (d) level.  Their study predicts that the 

armchair  silicon  structures  are  more  stable  compared  to  the  zigzag  structures.  Barnard 

and Russo32 have investigated the energetics and structural properties of infinite armchair 

5

5

 

 

and zigzag silicon nanotubes (SiNT) as a function of tube diameter. They studied A(3,3) 

through  A(9,9)  and  Z(3,0)  through  Z(9,0)  nanotubes.  All  calculations  were  performed 

with  the Vienna  ab  initio  simulation  package  (VASP)  using  the  generalized  gradient 

approximation  to  density  functional  theory  (GGA-DFT)  with  the  Perdew  and  Wang 

functional. Ultra-soft, gradient-corrected-Vanderbilt-type pseudopotentials were used and 

the studies showed that the atomic heat formation of  a silicon nanotube is dependent on 

the  nanotube  diameter,  but  independent  of  the  chiral  structure  of  the  tube.  Also,  it  was 

shown  that  the  individual  cohesive  energies  and  strain  energies  are  dependent  on  both 

diameter  and  chirality.  The  response  of  hypothetical  silicon  nanotubes  under  axial 

compression has been investigated by  Kang et al33. using atomistic simulations  based on 

the  Tersoff  potential.  Bai  et  al.34  have  used  molecular  dynamics  and  cluster-stacking 

approach to predict the possible existence of one-dimensional silicon nanostructures: the 

square, pentagonal, and hexagonal single-walled silicon nanotubes.  They concluded that 

the stacked short and thin nanotubes were  locally stable  in vacuum and have zero  band 

gap,  suggesting 

that 

the  SWSiNTs  are  possibly  metals  rather 

than  wide-gap 

semiconductors. Using ab initio total energy calculations, Singh et al. have studied metal 

encapsulated  nanotubes  of  silicon.35  They  found  the  finite  nanotubes  to  have  varying 

HOMO-LUMO  gaps  depending  on  the  length  and  amount  of  doping  but  infinite 

nanotubes were metallic, symmetric, and stable.  There has been only one study on Ge-H 

nanotubes,  a  density-functional  tight  binding  study  by  Seifert  et  al.36  where  the  tubes 

were constructed by rolling sheets of polygermyne. These results indicate a possibility of 

germanium  nanotubes  with  interesting  photoluminescence  properties  and  the  GeH 

nanotubes  were  found  to  be  semi- conducting,  with  the  gap  size  growing  from  about 

6

6

 

 

1.1eV  from  the  smallest  nanotube  towards  the  value  of  1.35eV  of  germyne  sheets. All 

these studies indicate that significant controversies exist about silicon nanotubes. Also, as 

far  as  we  know,  there  has  been  no  study  up  till  now  using  the  cluster-CNT  based 

approach  to  study  bare  germanium  nanotubes.  Ours  is  the  first  attempt  to  study  both 

silicon and germanium nanotubes on an equal basis  from this perspective. We examine 

below  silicon  and  germanium  nanotubes  with  varying  sizes  and  present  a  comparative 

electronic structure analysis between silicon and germanium nanotubes. 

2. Results and discussions  

 

Our approach for construction of the nanotubes is based on single-walled carbon 

nanotubes and the finite cluster approach. The easiest way to visualize how nanotubes are 

built  is to start with graphite- like sheets of silicon and germanium. Then a single–walled 

nanotube is constructed by wrapping one single layer of the graphite - like sheet to form a 

cylindrical  shape.  Starting  with  only  one  layer  of  2-dimensional  graphite- like  sheet we 

end  up  with  a  cylinder  with  only  one  wall,  namely  a  single  wall  nanotube  (SWNT). If 

more layers are taken into account, cylinders with multiple walls may result, a multi wall 

nanotube  (MWNT).  Our  interest  here  lies  only  in  the  single-walled  nanotube.  The 

structure of such nanotubes may be described in terms of chirality and length. Chirality 

and diameter are specified in terms of magnitude of the components of chiral vector. The 

vector Ch which maps an atom from the left hand border onto an atom on  the right border 

line is an  integer  multiple  of  the  two  basis vectors a1 and a2, i.e., Ch = n a1 + m a2 with 

integers n and m. Depending upon how the sheet is rolled we have three types of tubes. 

For armchair m = n,  for  zigzag m = 0 and  for chiral  nanotubes  m ? n.  In this work, we 

have concentrated on armchair SWNTs.

As  far  as  computations  are  concerned,  we  note  that  given  the  large  sizes  of  the 

systems  under  consideration,  an  accurate  method  with  low  computational  overhead  is 

both  necessary  and  desirable.  The  two  standard  methods  in  computational  condensed 

matter  physics,  one  based  on  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  theory  and  the  other  on  density 

functional  theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA) or  in the generalized 

gradient  approximation  (GGA),  both  have  their  advantages  and  disadvantages.37,  38 On 

the  other  hand,  hybrid  density  functional  theory  incorporating  Hartree-Fock  exchange  

with  DFT  exchange-correlation  have shown  to  be  a  promising  method.  Therefore,  we 

have used B3LYP39, a hybrid functional, and the Los Alamos pseudopotential LANL2DZ 

40 with the associated basis set (for Si  atom the electrons 1s 2s 2p  orbitals and for Ge the 

electrons  in  1s  2s  2p  3s  3p  3d  orbitals  are  replaced  by  core  potentials)  to  perform 

atomistic  simulations  of  silicon  and  germanium  nanotubes.  The  quality  of 

B3LYP/LANL2DZ  scheme  for  the  description  of  Si  and  Ge  nanotubes  was  tested  by 

calculations on Si and Ge atoms and the dimers. For Si atom, the ionization potential and 

electron affinity are 8.462eV and 0.896eV to be compared with the experimental values 

of  8.151eV  and  1.385eV,  respectively.  For  Ge  atom,  our  values  are  8.008eV  and 

0.841eV, and the experimental values are 7.9eV and 1.233eV, respectively.  A  very  large 

basis  set  is  necessary  for  the  theoretical  electron  affinity  to  approach  the  value  of  the 

experimental  electron  affinity  and  this  was  not  considered  to  be  necessary  and 

computationally feasible for the large clusters representing the nanotubes studied in this 

work. For Si and Ge dimers, our bond  lengths are 2.352 Å and 2.527 Å, to be compared 

with the experimental values of 2.32 Å and 2.44 Å, respectively. For SiH and GeH, our 

values are 1.547 Å and 1.630 Å, respectively and the experimental values are 1.52 Å and

pseudopotential  with  the  associated  basis  set  can  be  considered  to  be  quite  satisfactory. 

The  cohesive  energy  or  the  binding  energy  per  atom  for  each  system  was  computed  as 

per the following formula: 

where  m  is  the  number  of  silicon or germanium  atoms and  n is the number of hydrogen 

atoms in the nanotube,  and E(X) where (X=Si or Ge) and E(H) are the  ground state total 

energies of  the silicon or germanium and hydrogen atoms respectively.

 is the 

total energy of the optimized clusters representing the nanotubes. 

In  figures  1-2,  we  present  the  structures  of  silicon  and  germanium  na notubes. 

Figure  3  gives  a  detailed  description  of  the  optimized  bond  lengths  (Angstroms), bond 

angles and co-ordination between the atoms for a sample Si (4, 4) and Ge (4, 4) nanotube. 

All structures are Berny geometry and spin-optimized.42 In tables 1-2 we present results 

for  the  comparative  study  of  the  electronic  and  geometric  structures  of  Si  and  Ge 

nanotubes  in  armchair  A  (3,  3)  through  A  (9,  9)  structures.  The  HOMO-LUMO  gap  is 

computed  as  the  energy  difference  between  the  highest  occupied  molecular  orbital and 

the  lowest  unoccupied  molecular  orbital.  All  computations  have  been  performed  using 

the Gaussian ‘03  suite of programs43 at the Supercomputing Center of the University of 

Texas at Arlington.  

As mentioned before, all seven systems  for Si or Ge have been modeled using the 

finite-cluster-CNT  based  approach.  The  smallest  armchair  silicon  nanotube  Si  (3,  3) 

SiNT  is  modeled  as

  cluster.  The  largest  system  studied  for  silicon  nanotubes 

SiNT  is  Si  (9,  9)  nanotube  modeled  as 

180HSi

36

.  For  germanium  nanotube,  the

corresponding clusters are  Ge60H12 and  Ge180H36. .Hydrogen  termination  is  used  for  the 

nanotubes  to  simulate  the  effect  of  longer  tubes  and  saturate  the  dangling  bonds.  The 

initial configurations of the nanotubes were based on the assumption that the nanotubes 

can be constructed by folding a 2D graphene like sheets of Si/Ge with a bond distance of 

2.25 ?  for Si and 2.45 ?  for Ge.  

As  shown  in  figures  1  and  2  the  optimized  structures  of  the  silicon  and 

germanium  nanotubes  show  a  puckered  or  corrugated  appearance.  The  smallest  tubes 

armchair  Si  (3,  3) and  Ge  (3,  3)  show  a  slightly  more  non- uniform  diameter  than  other 

configurations.  With  the  increase  in  tube  diameters  from  A  (3,  3)  to  A  (9,  9)  the 

structures tend to be more uniform. As mentioned before, figure 3 shows the coordination 

of Si and Ge atoms in the armchair Si (4,4) and Ge(4,4) nanotubes  in the middle part of 

the tube. For SiNT (4, 4) (Figure 3a) the silicon atoms are not in same plane with Si-Si-Si 

angles of 117º and 119º, respectively.  The Si-Si  bond  lengths  alternate between 2.237  ?  

to 2.281  ?,  close  to  the  single  bond  values.  However,  on  the  periphery  of  the  tube  the 

hexagonal rings appear to show more alternation in bond lengths, between 2.188  ?  (Si = 

Si) to 2.468  ?  (Si  – Si). This bond length alternation of  0.28 ?  is more pronounced tha n 

that  in CNTs and exhibits a strong tendency for bond localization. This trend continues 

for the other tubes too. 

In the case of GeNT (4, 4) (Figure 3b) the Ge-Ge bond lengths vary from 2.383 to 

2.451 ?, throughout the tube length, showing a bond alternation of 0.068 ?. This is larger 

than the  alternation  observed  the  middle  part  of  the  SiNT  (4,  4)  (0.044  ?).   Poor  p-p 

overlaps,  hence  weak  p  bonding,  suggests  more  bond  alternation,  i.e.  less  electron 

10

delocalization. In case of GeNTs  this  is  more  prono unced than SiNTs. Hence, we see a 

more corrugated tubular shape for GeNTs than that for SiNTs.  

Table 2 and  figure 4 show the variations of the cohesive energies per atom in eV 

versus the number of atoms in the Si/Ge nanotubes. As the number of atoms increase the 

cohesive energy of silicon  nanotubes  increases. The largest SiNT studied Si (9, 9) has a 

cohesive  energy  of  3.138eV/atom,  about  68%  of  the  bulk  cohesive  energy  of  4.63 

eV/atom. The cohesive energies for germanium are lower than that of silicon as expected 

and  show  an  increasing  trend  although  not  a  smooth  one  as  SiNT.  The  largest  GeNT 

studied  Ge  (9,  9)  has  a  cohesive  energy  of  2.770  eV/  atom, about  72%  of  the  bulk 

cohesive  energy  of  3.85eV/atom.  As  a  comparison,  the  cohesive  energy  of  carbon 

nanotube can be  as high as  99% of the bulk.  This does  not however necessarily  rule out 

the existence of SiNT and GeNTs. 

One  of  the  central  questions  in  the  theory  and  applications  of  nanotubes  is  the 

possible  metallic  or  semi-conducting  properties  of  these  tubes.  To  examine  this  we 

calculated the highest-occupied- molecular-orbital to lowest-unoccupied- molecular-orbital 

(HOMO-LUMO) gap. These can provide a measure of the band gap for the infinite solid 

as the number of atoms in the cluster increases and also to analyze the conductivity of the 

nanotube. Table 3 and figures 5a and 5b show the variation of the HOMO-LUMO gaps 

with  the  tube  diameter  for  silicon  and  germanium  nanotubes  respectively.  The  gaps  for 

the silicon nanotubes are in the range of 0.885eV to 1.023eV. These gaps are smaller than 

the  bulk  silicon  gap  of  1.1eV  but  still  do  not  indicate  any  metallic  behavior  of  silicon 

nanotubes even for the largest cluster studied. We do note that as we go beyond the Si (6, 

6) nanotube with the tube diameter increasing, the gap decreases. This feature is different 

11

11

 

 

from  that  observed  in  case  of  carbon  nanotubes,  which  were  found  to  be  metallic  in 

armchair configuration. In case of germanium there is no definite pattern with respect to 

the increase  in tube diameter and the gaps show an oscillatory pattern. The range for the 

gaps  is  between  0.274ev  -0.865eV.  For  most  of  the  Ge  nanotubes,  the  gaps  are 

significantly  lower  that  the  bulk  value  of  0.7eV.  In  fact,  A  (5,  5)  and  A  (6,  6)  Ge 

nanotubes  have  gaps of only 0.274 and 0.252eV and it is  possible  that Ge nanotubes can 

exhibit  metallic  characteristics  depending  on  the  tube  diameter.  For  both  materials  in 

armchair configuration, the gaps do appear to be decreasing indicating a possible metallic 

behavior  in the infinite limit.   The high ratio of sp3 to sp2 hybridization and the extent of 

overlap  of  the  p  and  s  bonding  clearly  contribute  to  a  different  behavior  for  Si  and  Ge 

nanotubes  as  compared  C  nanotubes.  In  any  case,  our  results  indicate  that  germanium 

nanotubes have more of a metallic character than that of silicon nanotubes.  

In  conclusion,  we  have  examined  silicon  and  germanium  nanotubes  in  armchair 

configurations. Our results show that the germanium nanotubes are possible, though from 

the  point  of  view of stability,  silicon nanotubes  appear  to  be  more  stable  compared  to 

germanium  nanotubes.  Also  the  germanium  nanotubes  due  to  the  higher  sp3  character 

appear to be  more puckered in appearance than their carbon and silicon counterparts.  In 

our  previous  work  on  mixed  silicon  carbon  clusters,  we  found  that  with  proper 

stoichiometery of silicon and carbon  atoms  in  a  cluster,  one  can  achieve  highly  stable 

clusters [44]. One way to improve the sp2 character of  Si and Ge  tubes and thus possibly 

increase  stability  would  be  to  add  dopant  atoms  like  carbon.  Research  is  underway  to 

study  various  types  of  doping  like  substitutional  or  interstitial  doping  and  study  the 

characteristics and stabilities of these systems.

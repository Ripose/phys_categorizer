Abstract 
 
                The  dynamics  of  a  particle  under  damping  could  be  generally  derived  by 

reappraisal of the relativistic aspects in the variational analysis of Lagrangian mechanics. 

The radiation damping force covariantly obtained from the general result is free from the 

shortcomings  usually  encountered  in  electrodynamics.  The  force  characteristically 

evolves  in  a  dynamic  tetrad  space  having  one  base  vector  distinguishably  non-local 

attributing  to  the  matter-wave  property  in  quantum  mechanics.  The  meaning  of  the 

classically formulated world path with the quantum flavor is revealed.  

 
Key words: classical mechanics, relativity, electrodynamics.

                  Classically,  the  dynamics  under  damping  has  been  analyzed  by  many  authors  while 

predicting the motion of an individual particle in an external field as in electrodynamics [1,2,3], 

or  while  understanding  the  collective  behavior  of  a  macroscopic  system  as  in  the  statistical 

description through the use of Langevin, or, Fokker-Planck equations [4]. However, the analyses 

predicting the radiation damping force in electrodynamics are not entirely free of shortcomings. 

The  statistical  analyses  on  the  other  hand  make  ad  hoc  introduction  of  the  force.  Variational 

approach leading to the Lagrangian mechanics of a particle does not as such reveal the damping 

motion. The radiation damping effect is inducted into electrodynamics considering the radiation 

loss  from  the  accelerated  charged  particle.  Phenomenological  aspect  of  damping  though  taken 

care of by this induction, serious philosophical problems and their bizarre implications crop in the 

result.  The  damping  force  in  the  well-known  Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac  equation  of  motion  of 

electron  leads  to  the  acausality  problem  [5]  that  an  electron  gets  accelerated  even  before  the 

application of the electromagnetic field. Johnson et al [6] have recently addressed the acausality 

problem  considering  the  semiclassical  limit  of  the  relativistic  particle  dynamics  in  a  scalar 

quantum field decohered under the condition of quantum open system.  

                 In  this  work,  it  is  shown  through  reappraisal  of  the  Lagrangian  approach  in  the 

relativistic framework that the damping force finds its natural introduction in closed form in the 

generally derived equation of motion, that the force does not lead to any unwanted consequence, 

and  that  the  objectively  derived  dynamics  evolves  in  the  general  4-space  made  of  local  path 

properties  in  conjunction  with  a  non-local  one  related  to  the  matter  waves  known  in  quantum 

mechanics. The case of electrodynamic motion under the radiation damping is worked out with 

the help of the derived dynamics to highlight the merit of this formulation as compared that of the 
reported ones.  

            The Lagrangian mechanics starts from the fundamental principle of least action S applied 

to the motion of an object. Thus, in the relativistic description [5] the action S on classical path of 

a point particle defined by the following integral expression is minimized through the variation 

analysis:

               Conventionally,  the  first  step  in  the  variational  analysis  involves  intercomparison  of 

actions on the segments of the envisaged path

 should attain stationary value in the

radiation  reaction  feature  could  be  traced  to  the  inadequate  consideration  of  displacement 

properties of the varied paths. It may be recalled that the consideration of displacements between 

two points in the 4-space and its optimization are important in laying down the geodesic equation 

in general relativity.   

          Displacement such as  τ , is a specific property of the classically envisaged path,

converge to a path with unique displacement under the variational operation mentioned above. On 

the other hand, the operation carried out in a family will result in a path of unique displacement 

under  the  stationary  action,  and  this  way  a  set  of  variationally  arrived  paths

the geodetic minimization helps specifying a dynamic path among the set of paths. The dynamic 

path is in effect attained by the overall energy minimization in the variational displacement  δ

. This force would be 

absent in motions where the Lagrangian remains invariant such as at  τ

implies,  with  due  consideration  of  the  first  order  homogeneity  of

  in  4-velocity-variable

conventional equation (3) of motion. As for equation (4) it can be seen that under the parametric 

change  of  σ   to  σ

transformation by the homogeneity in 4-velocity as

Abstract 

High-resolution  γ−ray  spectrometry  was  exploited  to  determine  naturally  occurring 

thorium (Th), uranium (U) and potassium (K) elemental concentrations in the whole 

area covered by the Troodos Ophiolite Complex of Cyprus.  For that purpose, a total 

of 59 samples from surface soils and 10 from the main rock formations of the region 

of  interest  were  analysed.  Elemental  concentrations  were  determined  for  Th  (range 

from  2.5×10−3  ppm  to  2.0  ppm),  U  (from  8.1×10−4  ppm  to  0.6  ppm),  and  K  (from 

1.3×10−4  %  to  1.0  %).  The  average  values  (A.M  ±  S.D.)  derived  are  (0.24  ±  0.34) 

ppm, (0.10 ± 0.10) ppm and (0.21 ± 0.24) %, for Th, U, and K, respectively, in the 

soils,  and  (0.52  ±  0.17)  ppm,  (0.17  ±  0.11)  ppm  and  (0.49  ±  0.87)  %  in  the  rocks. 

From these values, a radioactivity (radioelement) loss of nearly 50% is estimated in 

the underlying surface soils due to bleaching and eluviation during weathering of the 

rocks. The measured Th/U ratio exhibits values between 2 and 4, whereas the K/Th 

ratio is highly variable ranging between 1.5×103 and 3.0×104.

Introduction 

The  main  external  source  of  irradiation  to  the  human  body  is  represented  by  the 

gamma  radiation  emitted  by  naturally  occurring  radioisotopes,  also  called  terrestrial 

environmental radiation. These radioisotopes, such as 40K and the radionuclides from 

the  232Th and  238U series and their decay products, exist at trace levels in all ground 

formations. Therefore, natural environmental radioactivity and the associated external 

exposure  due  to  gamma  radiation  depend  primarily  on  the  geological  and 

geographical  conditions,  and  appear  at  different  levels  in  the  soils  of  each  different 

geological region (UNSCEAR 2000 Report, and further references cited therein). The 

specific  levels  of  terrestrial  environmental  radiation  are  related  to  the  geological 

composition of each lithologically separated area, and to the content in thorium (Th), 

uranium  (U)  and  potassium  (K)  of  the  rock  from  which  the  soils  originate  in  each 

area.  

The  island  of  Cyprus  is  located  in  the  eastern  basin  of  the  Mediterranean  Sea  and 

extends to an area of about 9,300 km2.  Its characteristic geological formations can be 

classified into two broad main categories: those that belong to an ophiolite complex 

(extending to an area of about 3000 km2) and those of sedimentary origin (Figure 1). 

The  Cyprus  ophiolite  is  one  of  the  best  preserved  and  most  intensively  studied 

ophiolite  complexes  in  the  world,  and  is  known  as  the  Troodos  Massif  or  Troodos 

Ophiolite Complex (Moores and Vine, 1971; Robinson and Malpas, 1998).  

The large geological significance of the Late Cretaceous Troodos ophiolite is focused 

on its complete and non-disruptive sequence tougher with a displaced slab of altered 

2

ultrabasic  and  basic  plutonic  complex,  stratigraphically  overlain  successfully  by  a 

sheeted dyke complex, extrusive sequence and pelagic sediments (Moores and Vine, 

1971; Gass, 1980). Troodos is believed to have formed at several spreading axes in a 

supra-subduction  zone  environment  as  a  result  of  the  collision  of  the  African  and 

Eurasian  Plates  in  the  Late  Cretaceous  (Robinson  and  Malpas,  1998).  Geological 

conditions in the area maintained the whole ophiolite stratigraphy unimpaired through 

centuries and, hence, both the Troodos Ophiolite Complex and the ocean crust have 

exactly  the  same  layer  structure  (Figure  2).  Due  to  subsequent  erosion,  the  primary 

upward  succession  of  ophiolite  stratigraphy  was  arranged  in  an  outward  succession 

from  centrally  exposed  plutonic  rocks  to  a  sheeted  dyke  complex  and  peripheral 

pillow lavas  (De Silva,  1997). Out of  the complete  ophiolite sequence,  the  volcanic 

series is divided into the Upper Pillow Lavas (UPL), the Lower Pillow Lavas (LPL), 

and  the  Basalt  Group  (BG),  based  on  colour,  mineralogy,  abundance  of  dykes,  and 

the  relationship  to  the  sulphide  orebodies  (Wilson  and  Ingham,  1959).  A  simplistic 

diagram of the ophiolite stratigraphy along with the other formations appearing out of 

the  ophiolite  sequence  is  presented  in  Figure  3.  Generally,  in  respect  to  oxide 

abundance,  the  ophiolite  of  Troodos  is  rich  in  CaO and poor in SiO2.   Its rocks  are 

mostly  iron-  and  magnesium-saturated  or  oversaturated,  and  this  allows  their 

characterisation  as  basic  and  ultrabasic.  None  of  these  rock  types  belongs  to  the 

category  of  silica-oversaturated,  which  usually  is  associated  with  high  Th  and  U 

elemental concentrations (Faure, 1986).  

This study is part of a general project called “radioisotopes” that had the objective to 

systematically measure the terrestrial gamma radiation in the island, and to determine 

its contribution to the annual effective dose equivalent to the population (Tzortzis et 

al.,  2003,  2004).  After  the  completion  of  the  data  processing  and  analysis,  it  was 

 

3

realised that samples originating from the ophiolitic part of the island exhibited very 

low activity and elemental concentrations compared to the corresponding results from 

the samples of sedimentary origin. In this paper, the results from this study regarding 

Th,  U  and  K  elemental  concentrations  in  the  whole  area  of  the  Troodos  ophiolite 

complex  are  presented.  Although  intensively  studied  regarding  many  geological 

aspects, as mentioned before, the Troodos Ophiolite has remained unexplored up to 

now with respect to natural environmental radioactivity and associated Th, U, and K 

elemental concentrations appearing in its formations. The present study aims at filling 

this  vacancy  in  the  literature  and,  more  generally,  to  provide  data  on  Th,  U,  and  K 

elemental  concentration  that  are  also  relevant  to  the  ocean  crust  and  mantle  of  the 

earth. The experiments have been carried out in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the 

Department  of  Physics,  University  of  Cyprus,  using  a  high-resolution  γ−ray 

spectrometry system.  

Materials and methods 

Sample collection, preparation and counting 

A  total  of  115  surface  soil  samples  have  been  collected  throughout  the  whole 

accessible  area  of  the  island.  This  area  was  divided  into  seven  different  geological 

regions, three of which belong to the Troodos ophiolite, as indicated in the simplified 

map  of  Figure 1.  Samples were collected  from  different locations  falling  within  the 

boundaries of each of the seven geological regions considered. More than half (59) of 

the  samples  were  collected  from  the  Troodos  Ophiolite    (Regions  4,  6,  and  7).  In 

addition,  10  samples  from  the  predominant  rock  formations  of  the  study  area  were 

also collected and pulverised. Collected soil samples were air-dried, sieved through a 

fine  mesh,  hermetically  sealed  in  standard  1000-ml  plastic  Marinelli  beakers,  dry-

 

4

weighed  and  stored  for  about  four  weeks  prior  to  counting.  The  exact  procedure 

followed for the sample collection, preparation and counting is analytically described 

elsewhere (Tzortzis et al., 2003, 2004).  

Each plastic sample container was placed on the active area of a shielded High-Purity 

Germanium  (HPGe)  detector,  and  measured  for  a  counting  time  of  18  hours.  The 

energy spectrum of the emitted gamma rays was obtained with a relative photopeak 

efficiency  of  ∼33%  and  with  an  energy  resolution  (FWHM)  of  1.8  keV  at  the  1.33 

MeV  reference  transition  of  60Co  (details  are  given  in  Tzortzis  et  al.,  2003).  

Depending  on  the  peak  background,  the  Minimum  Detectable  Activity  (MDA)  was 

calculated  to  be  1.0×10−2  Bq kg−1  for  both  232Th  and  238U,  and  4.0×10−2 Bq kg−1  for 

40K,  for  the  counting  time  of  18  hours.    From  these  values,  detection  limits  of 

2.5×10−3 ppm, 8.1×10−4 ppm and 1.3×10−4 % were derived, for Th, U and K elemental 

concentrations, respectively. 

Following the spectrum analysis, count rates for each detected photopeak and activity 

per  mass  unit  (specific  activity)  for  each  of  the  detected  nuclides  are  calculated  in 

units of Bq kg−1.  Specific activity of 232Th, 238U and 40K was then converted into total 

elemental concentration  of  Th,  U  and  K, respectively. They  are  reported  in units of 

ppm for Th and U, and as a percentage (%) for K (Tzortzis et al., 2003).  

Results and discussion 

Samples  of  ophiolitic  origin  are  categorised  in  three  groups,  one  for  each  different 

geological  region  as  indicated  in  Figure  1  (Regions  4,  6,  and  7),  and  the  average 

activity  and  elemental  concentrations  of  Th,  U,  and  K  for  all  the  three  regions  are 

summarised  in  Table 1, from soil as well  as from rock samples.  Such a  number  of 

 

5

collected  samples  can  be  considered  as  a  representative  inventory  of  the  various 

outcropping geological formations in the region of interest.  

In general, the calculated elemental concentrations of Th, U and K are rather low in 

all  the  samples  measured;  this  is  particularly  observable  in  samples  collected  in 

Region  4,  which  exhibits  the  lowest  concentration  in  all  the  radionuclides 

investigated. This region consists of the upper levels of plutonics with their complex 

structure  being  well  exposed:  plagiogranites,  which  are  apparently  the  result  of 

extreme fractionation of basaltic magma, and the essential nature of layered gabbros, 

dunite/harzburgite  relationships,  wehrlite,  and  formation  of  chromitite  pods  (Keller, 

1999).  On  the  other  hand,  Region  7  that  is  mainly  composed  of  rocks  of  volcanic 

sequence, thus the Upper and Lower Pillow Lavas and the Basalt Group, shows the 

highest  activity  concentration  in  all  the  radionuclides  investigated.  Concentration  of 

Th ranged from 2.5×10−3 ppm to 2.0 ppm, of U from 8.1×10−4 ppm to 0.6 ppm and of 

K from 1.3×10−4 % to 1.0 % for all the samples measured. It should be noted that the 

lower values  given correspond to the detection limit (MDA) derived for  each of the 

three  radionuclides,  since  some  samples  exhibited  nearly  zero  net  activity  after  the 

subtraction  of  the  laboratory  ambient  background.  Arithmetic  mean  elemental 

concentrations over all the samples of ophiolitic origin are (0.24 ± 0.34) ppm, (0.10 ± 

0.10) ppm, (0.21 ± 0.24) %, for Th, U and K, respectively, while the island’s average 

values  from  ground  formations  are  (1.2  ±  1.7)  ppm,  (0.6  ±  0.7)  ppm  and  (0.4  ± 

0.3) %, respectively (Tzortzis and Tsertos, 2004). This indicates that the values of the 

elemental  concentrations,  calculated  for  the  samples  of  ophiolitic  origin,  are 

significantly lower than the corresponding ones collected from all over the island. 

Th, U, and  K elemental concentration ranges  derived  from investigations conducted 

in some other known ophiolite complexes of neighbouring regions close and around 

 

6

the  Mediterranean  Sea  are  illustrated  in  Table  2.    From  this  comparison,  it  can  be 

concluded  that  the  corresponding  Th,  U,  and  K  elemental  concentration  values 

obtained from the present study fall within the range of the reported values from other 

ophiolites.  These  results  confirm  a  general  trend  that  the  content  of  those  ophiolite 

formations in radioelements is very low compared to the content of other rock types, 

e.g  of  sedimentary  origin.    In  other  words,  since  natural  radioactivity  is  directly 

related  to  the  soil  content  in  Th,  U,  and  K,  the  Troodos  Ophiolite,  and  the  whole 

island of Cyprus in general, could be considered as one of the world areas that exhibit 

very  low  levels  of  natural  radioactivity.  It  is  also  important  to  underline  that  this 

feature reflects a difference in the rock geology of the island of Cyprus compared to 

that  of  the  neighbouring  Mediterranean  countries.  As  mentioned  before,  the  rock 

types appearing in Cyprus have their origin in a well-preserved ophiolite, and the data 

derived  regarding  Th,  U,  and  K  elemental  concentrations  are  characteristic  for  the 

crust and upper mantle of the earth (Faure, 1986). 

Th/U  and  K/Th  correlation  plots  are  drawn  in  Figure  4a,b,  which  may  provide 

information on the relative depletion or enrichment of the natural radioelements. Most 

of the Th/U data are linearly correlated, grouped into two main categories, exhibiting 

Th/U ratios of 2 and 3.  The theoretical value of  the radioelement ratio Th/U can be 

calculated according to:

where T is the half-life,   f  is the fractional atomic abundance, and  Μ is the atomic  

mass  of  the  corresponding  radioisotope  indicated.  Using  values  published  in  recent 

literature (Firestone et al., 1996-1999), the above formula yields the ratio Th/U ≅ 3.0, 

which is the typical value observed in normal continental crust.  

 

 

7

The  K/Th  data  (Fig.  4b)  revealed  less  pronounced  correlations,  with  typical  ratios 

ranging  between  1.5×103  and  3×104.  For  comparison,  the  corresponding  Th/U  and 

K/Th correlation plots from surface soils and rocks of sedimentary origin (regions R1, 

R2, R3, R5) are presented in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the Th/U ratio ranges from 1 to 6, 

while most of  the K/Th  data range  between 1.5×103  and  3×103. Also, the  Th/U  and 

K/Th  data  for  soils  of  ophiolitic  origin  (Fig.  4a,b)  appear  to  be  clustered  within  a 

narrow range due to the low content in these three radioelements. On the other hand, 

due to the very low concentration of Th and also of U in the ophiolite rocks, the K/Th 

ratios  exhibit  much  higher  values  in  ophiolites  (Fig.  4b)  compared  to  those  of 

sedimentary  origin  (Fig.  5b).  This  result  confirms  previous  indications  based  on 

averaged  data  extracted  from  the  seven  geological  regions  considered  (Tzortzis  and 

Tsertos, 2004). The observed features are in general agreement with the experimental 

results  reported  in  a  series  of  investigations  in  the  Alps-Apeninnes  transition  by 

Pasquale et al. (2001) and Chiozzi et al. (2002), in the Pindos ophiolite by Valsami-

Jones  and  Ragnarsdottir  (1997),  and  in  the  Samail  ophiolite  by  Chen  and  Pallister 

(1981).    

Due to bleaching and eluviation processes during weathering of a rock, a loss in the 

radioelement  concentration  and,  consequently,  in  the  resulting  natural  radioactivity 

and dose rate is observed in the underlying surface soils.  A measure, ε, for the total 

radioactivity loss can be calculated according to: 

ε

=

〈 〉
p
〈 〉
q

 

(2) 

where p is the total radioactivity or, equivalently, the total dose rate in the soil, and q 

the corresponding value in the rock. Since the dose rate on the soil surface and that of 

the rock surface are proportional to the sum of the weighted activity concentrations of 

 

 

 

8

232Th, 238U, and 40K of the soil and rock, one can use the known dose rate conversion 

factors of 232Th, 238U, and 40K (Tzortzis et al., 2003) to estimate ε: 

ε

Using this relation and the measured average activity concentrations, shown in Table 

1, a value of  ε ≅ 0.46 is  calculated which  is very  close to the value (0.47) obtained 

from  world  data,  recompiled  recently  by  Minato  (2002).  This  means  that,  on  an 

average, nearly 50% of the radioelement content in the rocks of the Troodos ophiolite 

complex is depleted in the underlying surface soils. It is important to note here that a 

very similar value for ε is obtained, when the island’s average concentrations for soils 

and rocks, shown in Table 2, are used in Eq. (3).  Finally, this argumentation might be 

reversed to explain in a quite natural way the larger radioactivity levels observed in 

rocks (Tzortzis et al., 2003) compared to the corresponding values obtained from the 

underlying surface soils (Tzortzis et al., 2004), as being due to the effect of bleaching 

and eluviation during weathering of the rocks.  

Conclusions 

High-resolution  γ−ray  spectrometry  is  a  powerful  experimental  tool  in  studying 

natural  radioactivity  and  determining  elemental  concentrations  in  various  surface 

soils and rock formations. For the predominant geological formations of the Troodos 

Ophiolitic  Complex  that  were  investigated  appear  generally  to  have  lower 

radionuclide concentrations, as compared to those of sedimentary origin. The average 

values (A.M ± S.D.)  derived  are  (0.24  ± 0.34) ppm, (0.10 ± 0.10) ppm and (0.21  ± 

0.24) %, for Th, U, and K, respectively, in the soils, and (0.52 ± 0.17) ppm, (0.17 ± 

0.11) ppm and (0.49 ± 0.87) % in the rocks.  These values fall within the typical range 

9

 

 

  

 

of  other  ophiolites  studied  worldwide  by  other  authors,  revealing  that  ophiolites 

exhibit very low levels of natural radioactivity. Data on Th/U and K/Th correlations 

for soils of ophiolitic origin appear to be clustered within a narrow range due to the 

low content in these three radioelements. Due to the very low concentration of Th and 

also  of  U  in  the  ophiolite  rocks,  the  K/Th  ratios  exhibit  much  higher  values  in 

ophiolites compared to those of sedimentary origin. The measured Th/U ratio exhibits 

values  between  2  and  4,  whereas  the  K/Th  ratio  is  highly  variable  ranging  between 

1.5×103  and  3.0×104.  Finally,  a  radioactivity  (radioelement)  loss  of  nearly  50%  is 

estimated  in  the  underlying  surface  soils  due  to  bleaching  and  eluviation  during 

weathering of the rocks.

FIGURE CAPTIONS 

Figure  1.  Simplified  geological  map  of  Cyprus,  indicating  the  Troodos  Ophiolitic 

complex  with  its  three  geological  regions  discussed  in  this  survey;  the  various  rock 

formations appearing are described in the legend. 

Figure  2.  The  stratigraphy  of  an  Ophiolite  model  appears  exactly  the  same  to  the 

layer structure of the ocean crust. Here, the various geological layers are drawn as a 

function of the ocean crust depth. 

Figure 3.  The Troodos ophiolite stratigraphy (R4, R6, and R7) along with the other 

geological layers appearing out of the ophiolite sequence (R1, R2, R3, and R5). 

Figure 4. (a) Th versus U and (b)  K versus Th  concentration plots from surface soils 

and  rocks  of  the  Troodos  ophiolite.  Solid  lines  represent  different  values  of  ratios 

indicated.   

Figure 5. The same as in Fig. 4, but for surface soils and rocks of sedimentary origin 

(R1, R2, R3, R5 regions shown in Fig. 3)

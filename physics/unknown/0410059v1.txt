Abstract: Dispersion equations have been derived for field-aligned cyclotron waves in  dipole magnetospheric 
plasmas  with  anisotropic  temperature.  Vlasov  equation  is  solved  for  trapped  particles  with  both  the  bi-
Maxwellian and bi-Lorentzian distribution functions accounting for the cyclotron and bounce resonances. New 
transverse permittivity elements are expressed by the summation of bounce-resonant terms including the double 
integration in velocity space, the resonant denominators, and the phase coefficients. To have some analogy with 
the  linear  theory  of  cyclotron  waves  in  the  straight  magnetic  field,  we  assume  that  the  n-th  harmonic  of  the 
electric field gives the main contribution to the n-th harmonic of the current density, and the connection of the 
left- and right-hand waves is small. In this case, the dispersion equations for  cyclotron waves have the simplest 
form and are suitable to annualise the instabilities of both the electron- and ion-cyclotron waves accounting for 
the bounce resonance effects.  
 
 

1.  Introduction and plasma model 
Cyclotron  waves  are  an  important  component  of  the  magnetospheric  environment.  
As  is  well  known,  the  energetic  particles  (electrons,  protons,  heavy  ions)  with  anisotropic 
temperature (pressure) can excite a wide class of cyclotron wave instabilities. Kinetic theory 
of  electromagnetic  cyclotron  waves/instabilities  in  the  straight  magnetic  field  case  is 
developed  quite  fully,  see  e.g.  Refs.  [1-3]  and  bibliography  therein.  However,  for 
magnetospheric  plasmas,  these  instabilities  should  be  analysed  by  solving  the  Vlasov-
Maxwell's  equations  taking  into  account  a  two-dimensional  nonuniformity  of  the 
geomagnetic field and bounce-resonant wave-particle interactions [4-7].

              ICR-ICR lines are the lines of the constant geomagnetic field. 
 
In this paper, we derive the dispersion relation for the field-aligned cyclotron waves 
in  an  axisymmetric  dipole  magnetosphere,  where  the  module  of  an  equilibrium  magnetic 
field, in the spherical coordinates (

), is (in the point dipole approximation)

Here,  R0  is  the  radius  of  the  Earth,  R  is  the  geocentric  distance,  q     is  the  geomagnetic 
latitude,  B0    is  the  Earth's  equatorial  magnetic  field,  see  Fig.  1.  There  are  considered  the 
collisionless  plasmas  including  the  particles  with  anisotropic  temperature,  where  charged 
particles  are  magnetically  trapped  having  the  two  steady-state  distribution  functions  in 
velocity space: 1) bi-Maxwellian, and/or 2) bi-Lorentzian. 
 

2. Reduced Vlasov equation 

 To  evaluate  the  transverse  dielectric  permittivity  elements  we  solve  the  Vlasov 
equation  for  trapped  particles  with  anisotropic  temperature  using  a  standard  method  of 
switching  to  new  variables  associated  with  the  conservation  integrals  of  the  energy:

4. Dispersion equation of the cyclotron waves 
 Since  the  cyclotron  wave  instabilities  are  an  important  contributor  to  cool  plasma 
heating,  it  is  possible  (and  interesting)  to  develop  a  two-dimensional  numerical  code  to 
describe  these  processes  in  the  Earth's  magnetosphere  with  new  dielectric  tensor 
components, accounting for the bounce-resonant effects.  

To  have  some  analogy  with  linear  theory[1-3]  of  cyclotron  wave  instabilities  in  the 
straight  magnetic  field,  let  us  assume  that  the  n-th  harmonic  of  the  electric  field  gives  the 
main contribution to the n-th harmonic of the current density (one-mode approximation). In 
this 
(when 
m=0,

), there is following dispersion relation:

To find the instability conditions (e.g., the thresholds) it is necessary to compare the wave 
growth rate (by the energetic particles with anisotropic temperature) and the  corresponding 
damping  rate    (by  the  cold  particles  with  isotropic  temperature).  The  contributions  of  the

5. Lorentzian (or kappa) distribution function 

 Of course,  an approach developed in sections 2-4 for magnetospheric plasmas with 
bi-Maxwellian  distribution  functions  in  velocity  space  can  be  applied  as  well  for  plasmas 
with the more general distributions including, e.g., the bi-Lorentzian distribution functions.

Conclusion 

In  this  paper,  we  have  derived  the  dispersion  equations  (22)  for  field-aligned 
cyclotron  waves  in  an  axisymmetric  dipole  magnetospheric  plasmas  with  both  the  bi-
Maxwellian (6) and bi-Lorentzian (24) distribution functions. To evaluate the contribution of 
the  trapped  particles  to  the  transverse  current  density  components  the  Vlasov  equation  is 
solved  using  a  standard  method  of  switching  to  new  variables  (2)  associated  with 
conservation integrals of particle energy, magnetic moment and equation of the geomagnetic 
)(qt
,  Eq.(12),  is  introduced  (instead  of  the 
field  line;  the  new  time-like  variable 
geomagnetic latitude angle q ) to describe the bounce-periodic motion of the trapped particles 
along the geomagnetic field; the perturbed electric field and current density components are 
Fourier-decomposed over the length of the geomagnetic field lines, Eqs. (15). As a result, the 
transverse permittivity elements, Eqs. (18, 27) are expressed by summation of the bounce-
resonant terms including the double integration in velocity space, the resonant denominators, 
and the corresponding phase coefficients. Due to magnetic field nonuniformity, the bounce-
resonance  conditions  for trapped particles in magnetospheric plasmas are entirely different 
from ones in the straight magnetic field; the whole spectrum of the electric field is present in 
the given current density harmonic; the left- and right-hand polarised waves are coupled. To 
have some analogy with the linear theory of cyclotron waves in the straight magnetic field, 
there were assumed that the n-th harmonic of the electric field gives the main contribution to 
the n-th harmonic of the current density and the connection of the left- and right-hand waves 
is small. In this case, the dispersion equation for cyclotron waves has the simplest form and 
is  suitable  to  analyse  the  instabilities  of  both  the  electron-  and  ion-cyclotron  waves 
accounting for the cyclotron and bounce resonances.

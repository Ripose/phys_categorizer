To  study  the  influence  of  synchro-betatron  resonances 
in  the  case  of  the  strong  longitudinal  focusing,  the 
simulation  of 
the  non-linear  beam  behavior  was 
performed  with  the  help  of  the  ACCELERATICUM 
computer code [4]. 

INTRODUCTION 
The DAΦNE-II project is considered now as a possible 
candidate  for  upgrading  the  DAΦNE  electron-positron 
collider and improving its luminosity. The basic idea is to 
use  a  strong  RF  focusing  mechanism  [1]  to  compress  a 
bunch  at  the  interaction  point  and  hence  to  get  a  chance 
for the vertical beta reduction. 

An intrinsic feature of the strong RF focusing is 
a  large  value  of  synchrotron  tune  and  one  can  assume 
intuitively  that  just  like  the  betatron  strong  focusing 
results  in  the  transverse  dynamic  aperture  limitation,  the 
synchrotron strong focusing can provide the same but for 
the energy dependent dynamic aperture. 

In  order  to  check  that,  we  were  performing  a  3-D 
simulation  of  the  DAΦNE-II  dynamic  aperture  under 
various assumptions (weak and strong RF focusing). The 
results of this tracking are presented in the paper. 

DAΦNE-II LATTICE 
 The  DAΦNE-II  lattice  proposed  by  C.Biscari  [2]  has 
large  negative  momentum  compaction  factor 
rather 
necessary  for  effective  bunch  length  squeezing  and  as  a 
promising  counteraction  against  the  microwave  bunch 
lengthening  [3].  In  order  to  achieve  it,  the  arc  cell 
contains  negative  and  positive  curvature  dipole  magnets, 
a number of quadrupole magnets to focus the beam in the 
transverse plane and sextupole magnets to compensate for 
rather large natural chromaticity. 

The betatron and dispersion functions of the DAΦNE-II 
are  shown  in  Fig.1.1  and  Fig.1.2  while  the  main 
parameters are listed in Table 1.1. Dispersion-free straight 
sections  are  discussed  for  detector  and  RF  cavities 
accommodation.

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The  ACCELERATICUM  code  is  a  general-purpose 
code  to  study  different  aspects  of  particle  motion  in  a 
circular accelerator.  

It  provides  a  symplectic  6D 

the 
transversely  and  longitudinally  coupled  magnetic  lattice 
according to the formalism proposed by G.Ripken in [5]. 
The  formalism  uses  the  canonical  variables,  which  are 
commonly used in the six-dimensional linear theory

and which are also canonical in the non-linear formalism 
if  the  transformation  through  the  nonlinear  elements  is 
performed  with  the  help  of  Hamiltonian  generating 
functions approach. 

Besides the nonlinear dynamics, the 6D tracking allows 
us  to  investigate  linear  parameters  of  the  machine  as  a 

function  of  the  beam  momentum  deviation  (betatron 
functions,  dispersion,  etc.).  For  instance,  Fig.2.1  shows 
the nonlinear part of the chromaticity when the linear part 
is  corrected  to  zero  by  the  sextupoles  and  Fig.2.2  shows 
the momentum compaction factor as a function of energy 
deviation. 

URF=300  kV  corresponds  to  the  weak  focusing  while  3 
MV  and 5.8  MV  provide  strong  synchrotron  focusing  of 
the bunch at the IP. 

DYNAMIC APERTURE SIMULATION 
All plots of the dynamic aperture are presented for the 
interaction  point.  We  use  the  4D  (without  synchrotron 
motion) dynamic aperture shown in Fig.3.1 as a reference.

Fig.3.2  shows  the  DAΦNE-II  off-energy  dynamic 
aperture for the constant energy deviation (no synchrotron 
oscillation is turned on) for the weak (left plot) and strong 
(right plot) RF focusing. In this case, the limitation of the 
particle stable area can be explained by different on- and 
off-energy particle trajectories in the magnetic field. 

A  rather  different  situation  can  be  seen  in  Fig.3.3  and 
Fig.3.4,  where  the  synchrotron  oscillation  is  taken  into 
account.  While  for  the  weak  RF  focusing  the  dynamic 
aperture  does  not  differ  much  from  that  with  a  constant 
energy deviation (Fig.3.2, left), for the strong RF focusing 
the dynamic aperture became very small even for ∆p/p=0.  
The  following  schematic  mechanism  can  be  proposed.

where  νx0,  νz0  and  νs  are  the  linear  (non-perturbed)

every point of the dynamic aperture curve we have some 
particular betatron resonance that limits the stable area in 
this point. Then the synchrotron motion generates a set of 
satellite resonances, which are represented by lines at the 
amplitude plane Az(Ax). The resonance line equation can 
be defined from (3.2). For the sake of simplicity, consider

To  consider  dynamic  aperture  limitation  due  to  the

betatron  resonance  on  the  amplitude  plane.  The  strong 
satellite  resonance  inside  the  initial  dynamic  aperture 
provides  an  additional  reduction  of  the  stable  area  as  is 
clearly seen in the right of Fig.3.3 and Fig.3.4. 

In the case of weak RF focusing, the situation is not so 

serious for two possible reasons: 
(1)  The  distance  (in  the  amplitude  space)  between  the 
main  and  satellite  resonances  is  small  and  only  slightly 
distorts  later  the  edge  of  the  dynamic  aperture.  Some 
evidence of  this  fact  one  can  see  in  the  left-hand  side of 
Fig.3.3 (the blue and green curve). 
(2)  The  amplitude  of  the  satellite  resonance  depends  on 
the  synchrotron  tune  and  drops  down  with  the  satellite 
number k (most probably like the Bessel function). 

CONCLUSIONS 
The  6D  tracking  with  synchrotron  oscillation  shows 
that  in  the  case  of  strong  RF  focusing  the  dynamic 
aperture of the DAΦNE-II is reduced as compared to the 
week  focusing  case  or  constant  energy  deviation.  A 
possible  mechanism  of 
the 
synchrotron  motion  produces  satellites  of  the  strong 
sextupole resonances ,which limit the dynamic aperture in 
the  4D  case.  The  satellite  resonances  locate  inside  the 
 

this  reduction 

that 

is 

initially  stable  area  and  additionally  reduce  it.  The 
following  plan  for  the  further  study  and  recover  of  this 
phenomenon can be proposed: 
(1)  More  detailed  investigation  of  the  satellite  behaviour 
for  the  weak,  strong  and  intermediate  RF  focusing, 
including the satellites amplitude values. 
(2)  In  the  case  of  the  strong  RF  focusing  dependence  of 
dynamic  aperture  on  the  tune  point  is  to  be  explored  (in 
other  words, more  accurate  choosing  of  the  betatron  and 
synchrotron  tunes).  It  seems  that  all  the  three  tunes  are 
important now. 
(3)  As  the  satellites  resonances  location  depends  on  the 
detuning coefficients, it is necessary to check if it possible 
to control it by octupole magnets.

Abstract
The  closed  integral  equations  for  the  interfacial  tension  as  a  function  of  external
polarization at the liquid metal – ionic melt interface are derived. The version of Popel' – Pavlov
isotherm  is  applied  to  the  analysis  of  electrocapillary  curves  (ecc),  i.e.  the  dependences  of
interfacial tension on electrode potential. The interaction between adsorbed particles is taken into
account  within  the  ‘two  exchange  parameters’  approximation.  The  type  of  the  distribution  of
electric  potential  in  the  double  electric  layer  (del)  is  assumed  to  be  like  ‘in  series  connected
capacitors’. The methods of solution are proposed for the analysis of the experimental ecc’s.

Key words: surface tension, electrocapillary curve, interface, adsorption

1. Introduction
The  adsorption  of  components  under  external  electric  polarization  at  the  liquid
metal - oxide melt interface has been studied, as a rule, on the basis of the electrocapillary
equation and the ecc tracing back to the classical concept of the surface tension (see, for
instance, [1-4]).

In  the  previous  studies  devoted  to  the  ecc  analysis  [5-7],  the  model  has  been
developed  which  takes  into  account  the  competitive  adsorption  of  particles  shifting  a
zero-charge potential in Langmuir’s isotherm  approximation. The model  has  allowed  to
describe  quantitatively  the  electrocapillary  features  of  the  liquid  metal  -  oxide  melt
interface.  However,  the  reliability  of  the  obtained  data  concerning  processes  at  the
investigated boundary is low, apparently owing to a number of specific assumptions that
have to be made to derive the Langmiur isotherm.

In  particular,  within  the  framework  of  Langmuir’s  approximation,  adsorbed
particles interact only with the centers of adsorption, they do not interact with each other
and the energy of adsorption remains constant in all ‘places’ of adsorption, irrespective of
the surface covering degree. Besides, the adsorption involves only a monolayer close to
the surface. Generalization of these assumptions on the melts, certainly, is inconvenient,
and, despite of quite good consent achieved in the ecc description for various systems by
different authors [5-11], it is realized only as a starting point for the development of more
exact models.

The derivation of the general dependence of the interfacial tension on the structure
and  temperature,  published  earlier  [12,  13],  is  free  of  drawbacks  of  Langmiur’s
approximation. In our opinion, this approach is seldom used, and it is applied to the ecc
analysis in the present work.

2. Thermodynamic equation for interfacial tension
Let us consider a system composed of two condensed phases a and d separated by

+

the  interfacial  layers  c  and  d  (Fig.  1).  The  quantities  corresponding  the  first  phase,  we
shall  denote  with  the  superscript  <'>,  and  those  for  the  second  phase  with  <''>.  The
quantities in the bulk of the phases have a superscript V, and those in the interfacial layers
ω. The interfacial tension in such a system is equal to the work necessary to form a unit
area of the new interface. We may present it in a form:
' σσσ
''

=
(1)
where the interfacial tensions σ ' and σ " differ from the surface tensions (σ ')0 and (σ ")0
of the same non-interacting phases which have not been put into contact, by the quantities
∆σ '  and  ∆σ  ".  They  are  due  to  particle  interaction  in  the  corresponding  phases.  The
interaction  manifests  itself  in  the  substance  exchange,  the  formation  of  chemical  bonds
between  particles  of  the  phases,  the  redistribution  of  electrons  in  frontier  layers,  etc.
According  to  [1,  12],  the  interfacial  tension  σ '  is  determined  by  the  difference  of
chemical potentials (cp) in a superficial layer and in the bulk of the phase:
[
(
)
'

)
where the sum is taken over all components, and where ωi' is the partial molar area, (µi)'
ω )'  is an effective quantity,
is cp of i-th component of a phase (a particle of i type), (µi 
the  cp  of  i-type  particles  in  a  superficial  layer,  provided  that  the  surface  tension  is
removed [1, 4]. For a phase <''> similar expression is valid. Thus, the interfacial layer is
formally divided into two parts b and c, each of which is put down between the volume of
one of the phases and the second part of interfacial layer (Fig. 1).

In  the  following  we  shall

to liquid metal – ionic melt
system  in  which  the  ions

negative  electric  charges
will  be  meant  as  particles.

where ni is the charge number of an ion, F is the Faraday constant.

Popel' and Pavlov [12] have suggested to separate cp into the components, first of
which corresponds to the ideal system (‘id’) of non-interacting particles, and the second
one  is  responsible  for  the  interaction  (‘int’).  We  shall  assume,  as  it  seems  quite
reasonable,  that  the  term  describing  inter-particle  interaction  does  not  depend  on  the
electrode potential directly:

The  part  of  electrochemical  potential,  which  is  caused  by  the  interaction  in  a
superficial layer, was represented, as explained earlier, as an additive contribution of the
interaction  ecp  in  the  bulk  of  the  contacting  phases.  Contrary  to  [12,  13],  we  shall
express, what is more strict, the interaction cp in a superficial layer in terms of additive
contributions of those phase layers, which directly adjoin a superficial layer. For ecp of a
superficial layer on each side of the phases we have:

The equations (13) present a basis for the determination of the dependences σ' and
σ"  and  the  total  value  of  σ   on  the  electrode  potential  ϕ,  on  the  concentration  of
components and on other parameters. Note that the equations (13) have the most general
form in the approximation used. They are not independent, because they are coupled by
the parameters β(1)  and β(2)
. If  one assumes that the partial  molar  volumes are  equal  to
each other and they are independent of the content, the partial surface areas also will be
equal. Then we have for the interfacial tension:

Note  that  the  equation  for  σ   contains  a  great  deal  of  parameters,  and  it  can  be

applied for the description of experimental data only after some assumptions.

3. Potential modeling and electrocapillary equation
The electric potential ψV has constant value inside both phases  (see  Fig.  1),  and
we  may  suppose  that  the  peculiarities  of  the  curve  σ(ϕ)  should  be  governed  by  the
quantity ψω
 in corresponding phases of the interfacial layer. It is necessary to specify the
structure  of  superficial  layers  and  the  distribution  of  the  electric  potential  inside  the
phases.  In  the  primitive  case  (see  Fig.  2),  when  the  potential  changes  by  a  jump  at  the
phase  boundary,  and  holds

the  charge  of  ions  and  electrons  transferred  from  the  bulk  to  the  superficial  layer.  This
charge  determines  the  change  in  electrode  potential.  Another  additive  is  determined  by
the adsorption of  the components of the phases  (both charged and non-charged),  which
chemical potential changes in the vicinity of del. The particle, in the common case, gives
the  input  to  σ  twice:  at  first,  by  the  adsorption  at  one  of  the  sides  of  the  phases,  and
secondly, by transferring its charge to the del.

The equation (18) has the form of particular case of the Volterra equation and it
gives in a closed form the electrocapillarity equation in view of Popel’ – Pavlov isotherm.
Let us  consider  now  more  simple  potential  distribution.  The  transition  region  of
the  superficial  layers  b  and  c  in
this  case  can  be  treated  as  the
united  interfacial  layer.  As  it  was
done earlier, let us assume that the
electric  potential  holds  constant
inside the interfacial layer ψω
 and
it  changes  abruptly  at  the  phase
boundaries (see Fig. 3).

connected in series: C’ and C’’  are  del  capacitances,
l’  and  l’’  are  the  del’s  thickness,  (l<L,  L  is  the
interfacial layer thickness).

The  interfacial  tension  can  be
determined in two ways according
to formula (2), that means,  by  the
differences  of 
electrochemical
potentials in  the surface layer  and

2 For the application of the equation obtained to the analysis of ecc, it is reasonable to note that, as a rule
[5−10], the content of some component at the metal – ionic melt interface which is engaged in the electrode
process from one of the phases is such that its chemical (or electrochemical) potential does not depend on
ϕ. According to the Nernst equations, this allows to pass from chemical potentials to ϕ [2]:

that now there is only one average value of the surface layer parameters (region b in Fig.

Again, substituting the  potential difference in the exponential  argument  with  the
capacitance of corresponding del, and taking into account the relation of ε’  and integral

The  obtained  expression  presents  the  dependence  of  interfacial  tension  on  the
potential,  without  prepositions  that  are  characteristic  of  the  Langmiur  approach,  in  an
explicit form, and it may be applied to the analysis of experimental ecc’s, just like it has
been carried out earlier in [6] in the Langmuir approximation.

The solutions of these equations can be obtained by iteration procedure, provided
that the integral part does not give a great contribution. In the first approximation in this
case, the integral can be taken by substituting the first two terms of the right hand sides in
(18) and (20). For the determination of the total value of σ(ϕ)  the equation (18) (or (20))
must be solved for both phases.

4. Conclusion
The  formulae  proposed  by  Popel’  and  Pavlov  are  generalized  by  taking  into
account the effect of the electric field on the adsorption of surface-active particles. Under
the conditions of constant electric potential in the surface phases, and of abrupt jumps at
the superficial layers (the model of in-series connected capacitors), the integral equation
is  derived  for  the  interfacial  tension  with  the  parameters  having  explicit  physical
meaning. Thus, solving these equations by iteration procedure in several versions of the
models for the potential behavior in the surface area, the theoretical ecc’s can be obtained
for comparison of the model predictions with the experimental data.

The method for measurement of transverse profile (emittance) of the bunch by detecting
of radiation arising at the scattering of the bunch on   scanning wire is wide-spread. In this work
the  information  about  bunch  scattering  is  proposed  to  obtain  by  measuring  the  oscillation
frequency  of  the  tightened  scanning  wire.  In  such  way  the  system  of  radiation  (or  secondary
particles) extraction and measurement can be removed. The entire unit consist of a compact fork
with tightened wire and a scanning system.

Normal  oscillations  frequency  of  a  wire  depends  on  wire  tension,  its  geometric
parameters and, in second  approximation,  on  its  elastic  characteristics.  Normal  oscillations  are
generated due to interaction of an alternating current through the wire with magnetic field of a
permanent magnet. In this case the magnetic field of the accelerator (field of dipole magnets or
quadrupole  magnets)  is  suggested  to  use  for  excitation  of  oscillations.  Dependence  of
oscillations frequency on beam scattering is determined by several factors, including changes of
wire tension caused by transverse force of the beam, influence of beam self field. Preliminary
calculations show that influence caused by wire heating will dominate.

We  have  studied  strain  gauges  on  the  basis  of  vibrating  wire  from  various  materials
(tungsten, beryl bronze, niobium zirconium alloys). A scheme of normal oscillations generation
by  alternating  current  in  autogeneration  circuit  with  automatic  frequency  adjustment  was
selected. Special method of wire fixation and elimination of transverse degrees of freedom allow
to achieve relative stability better than 10-5 during several days. For a tungsten wire with a fixed
end dependence of frequency on temperature was 10-5K-1. Experimental results and estimates of
wire heating of existing scanners show, that the wire heats up to a few hundred grades, which is
enough for measurements. Usage of wires of µm thickness diminishes the problem of the wire
thermalisation speed during the scanning of the bunch.

Introduction

Method  of  beam  transverse  profile  measurement  in  accelerators  by  scanning  wire  is
wide-spread in accelerator technology [1-7]. In such way measurement of transverse profiles of
proton, antiproton, ion, electron, positron beams in wide range of energies is carried out without
destruction  of  the  beam  [1,  3].  This  method  will  also  be  used  in  new  extrahigh  energy
accelerators (see, e.g. [7-9]).

2

The essence of the method is measurement of radiation and/or secondary particles arising
at the scattering of the bean on scanning wire. Thus, the device consists of two essential units: a
scanning  mechanism  with  fixed  on  a  fork  wire  and  a  system  of  radiation  (particles)  receiver,
located along the beam propagation.

In  this  work  a  wire  vibrating  in  its  normal  frequency  is  proposed  to  use  as  a  wire
scanner. Note, that pickups on the basis of vibrating wire are also wide-spread in technology and
are used, in particular, in tensometry, gravimetry, measurements of magnetic field and magnetic
properties of materials (see, e.g. [10-12]).

A beam of charged particles affects on vibrating wire frequency in several ways, namely:
mechanical  transverse  influence  caused  by  transferred  pulse  of  the  beam,  influence  of  beam
magnetic field, radiation affect of the beam on the wire material, heating of the wire. The last
effect turned to  be dominating, since for typical currents of accelerator beams the wire of µm
diameter heats over 1000 K [3, 4].

In this work the strong dependence of normal frequency on its temperature and hence on
the  beam  scattering  is  proposed  to  use  for  measurement  of  beam  local  intensity.  Indubitable
advantage of this method is the compactness of the whole system and the elimination of the unit
of radiation receivers, which leads to the reduction of the price.

Authors  of  present  work  have  accumulated  a  certain  experience  in  development  and
producing  of  tension  gauges  on  the  basis  of  vibrating  wire.  In  particular,  good  results  on
frequency long-time relative stability ∼10-5  at relative solution ∼10-6  are obtained. As result of
frequency  multiplication  its  measurement  become  much  more  accurate.  We  have  used  such  a
pickup for measurement of spatial distribution of magnetic filed [13-14].

Bellow we describe the main processes taking place at beam scattering on wire, results of
wire heating modelling are presented, and specific problems, arising at development of vibrating
wire scanner are discussed.

Equilibrium temperature and wire thermalisation.

Equilibrium temperature of an immobile wire in vacuum under  beam  is  defined  by  the
balance between the power  ∆ ∆E t   brought to it by the beam and two factors of heat removal:
  and  thermoconductivity  of  the  wire

Note when scanning consecutively the total time of scanning is much more less than the
sum  of  thermalisation  times  of  individual  points,  because  the  wire  temperature  changes
insignificantly at passing from one point to another.

Estimate  of  transverse  force  for  relativistic  beams  acting  on  wire  gives  values  of  the

order of 

∼10-11 N. Thus, one can neglect the transverse force affect frequency.

As it was shown above the main result of the irradiation of the wire by the beam is its
heating. Heating of the scanning wire was modelled by alternating and direct currents  through
the  wire.  Wire  normal  oscillations  were  generated  in  two  modes:  with  one  free  end  and  with
fixed ends of the wire. The experiments were done in forevacuum evacuation.

In experiments with alternating current forced oscillations of current frequency arises (at

I

the current frequency 50 Hz normal oscillations broke at the current 

 > 50 mA).

When heating by direct current the same tungsten wires of diameter 70 µm were used.
Data obtained at constant wire tension are presented in Fig. 5. Results of two series of
measurements  for  are  presented.  The  first  series  (squares)  was  carried  out  for  currents  from
75mA  up  to  250  mA;  glow  appeared  at  235  mA.  Later  on  an  experiment  with  currents  from
215mA up  to 345  mA was done (diamonds). In first series the current was changed stepwise,
increasing consequently from the lower values to the upper ones. In second case between  two
consequent values the current was nullified, each current value being held during 2 minutes. In
second series the frequency had restored well at each switching on for currents up to 345 mA.
At  upper  values  of  the  current  after  each  heating  cycle  the  frequency  systematically  went  up.
Yellow glow (

≈1000 Ê) appears currents more than 300 mA.

Fig. 7. Transient characteristics of wire with fixed ends, I=215mA.

Fig.  6  shows  the  transient  characteristics  at  switching  on/off  for  current  215  mA.  One
can see that the frequency exceeds its steady-state value during a few seconds. One can take this
value for estimate of the thermalisation time  τ . Cooling  down  processes  are  depicted  without
destruction, because after switching on it takes some time for current to reach its steady-state.

Similar experiments were done for wires with fixed ends. As it was mentioned above, the
frequency changes interval was much more wider. Fig. 7  shows the transient characteristics at
switching on/off of the current 215 mA.

Restoration of the frequency in both cases (Figs. 6 and 7) were good enough, i.e. heating

of the wire up to 1000 K does not lead to irreversible changes of wire parameters.

Thus, the model experiments show, that reproducible generation of wire normal modes is
possible  at  its  considerable  heating.  And  theoretical  estimates  well  accord  with  obtained
experimental data.

Wire under Bunch - Proposal for Experiment

Let's  discuss  some  specific  problems,  which  can  arise  at  scanning  of  the  accelerator

bunch by a vibrating wire.

Magnetic field

There are two possibilities in scheme of wire scanner: to use a scheme with own

magnet or use the accelerator magnetic fields (dipole magnets, quadrupole lenses).

9

In  developed  by  the  authors  pickups  normal  oscillations  of  the  wire  were  excited  in
autogeneration scheme. Exciting action on the wire arises as a result of interaction between the
current  through  the  wire  and  magnetic  field  of  the  samarium  cobalt  magnet,  the  field  being
localised in an magnet operating gap of the length 10 mm. The characteristic field inside the gap
was about 8 kGs.

To  keep  the  transverse  effective  square  of  the  wire  with  respect  to  on-going  bunch,
separation of oscillations along the bunch axis is desirable. Accelerator magnetic fields meet this
requirement. It can also be satisfied at own magnet using.

Fields of dipole magnets are strong enough, however, they fix the horizontal movement

of the wire.

It is also possible to use the fields of quadrupole lenses. However, in such fields  even
modes of the wire normal oscillations are possible. Scanning can be done in vertical, horizontal
or under the angle 450 directions.

Usage of vibrating wire scanners with own magnets located in accelerators free spaces is
also  possible.  In  so  doing  it  is  preferable  to  intersect  the  bunch  at  1/4  of  wire  length,  the
magnetic circuit being located symmetrically with respect to wire centre, in such way providing
generation  of  the  second  harmonic.  In  this  case  the  magnetic  field  outside  the  gap  is  to  be
carefully screened.

an experiment with shortened magnetic circuit, shifted along the wire. Results of experiment are
presented in Fig. 8. The horizontal axis is the shift of the centre of magnetic circuit with respect
two  fixed  end  of  the  wire.  Position  20  corresponds  to  the  wire  middle.  Shift  of  the  magnetic

10
circuit downwards (in Fig. 8 to right) was limited by the construction, however, one can see that
excitation of normal harmonics  of  the  wire  is  symmetric  with  respect  to  its  middle.  Usage  of
short magnetic circuit results in generation of third harmonic in central position. By shifting of
the magnetic circuit one can obtain generation of third, fourth, fifth or sixth harmonics (in figure
are indicated by numbers). There was a silence zone, too. Of course, experiments results depend
on geometric characteristics, however, they show the possibility of stable generation of needed
harmonic.

Note one can neglect the self magnetic fields of the bunch. These fields are much more
less than the external accelerator fields, and, secondly their affection results in a small influence
of magnetic field amplitude (wire oscillations amplitude, indeed) on frequency.

Radiation Resistance
Tungsten  and  bronze  (beryl  bronze)  are  used  both  in  scanning  wire  and  vibrating  wire
technologies. In both  cases they show high  radiation  resistance.  The  electronic  circuit  exciting
the wire scanner oscillations is located far from the wire and can be sufficiently screened from
radiation.  Other  parts  of  vibrating  wire  scanner  are  passive  elements  and  are  also  radiation
resistant.

Thermal Stability, Thermalisation Times
Stability  with  respect  to  wire  heating  is  one  of  the  main  problems  in  developed  wire
scanner  technologies.  To  solve  this  problem,  the  scanning  was  done  at  a  high  speed,  up  to
≈10m/sec. [3, 4], i.e. the wire passes across the mm size bunch during 10-4  seconds. Such times
are too small for thermalisation of the wire. Note, the estimate (5) of τ   can be lowered, because
in real movement from one point to another will result in less temperature jumps. However, one
cannot expect thermalisation times less than 10-2  at temperatures, where long time exploitation
of wire is possible.

Usage of thin and short wires will give some advantage.
It  is  possible  that  limit  on  thermalisation  time  can  be  solved  by  improvement  of  wire
fixing  system,  which  now  is  essentially  simplified  in  comparison  with  similar  wire  scanning
systems.

Mainly peripheral  monitoring  of  the  bunch  and  its  accompanying  radiation  also  can  be

interesting.

Vacuum System
Since  the  vibrating  scanner  system  consist  of  one  unit,  its  installation  into  accelerator
vacuum system will accompany less problems than in the case of two-unit wire scanner system.
It  is  also  desired  to  have  a  system  of  wire  replacing  without  loss  of  vacuum  in  acceleration
chamber.

Frequency measurement
The problem frequency quick measurement is solved by its preliminary multiplication by
a large factor. Thus, in experimentally realised pickups multiplication by 32 allows to measure
few kHz frequencies with accuracy 0.03 Hz during 1 sec.

Indubitable advantage of proposed method is  the compactness of the whole system and
the  elimination  of  the  unit  of  radiation  receivers.  The  peripheral  monitoring  of  the  bunch  by
proposed method also can be interesting.

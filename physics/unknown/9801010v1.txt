The notion of a local fractional derivative (LFD) was introduced recently for functions of a single
variable. LFD was shown to be useful in studying fractional diﬀerentiability properties of fractal
and multifractal functions.
It was demonstrated that the local H¨older exponent/ dimension was
directly related to the maximum order for which LFD existed. We have extended this deﬁnition to
directional-LFD for functions of many variables and demonstrated its utility with the help of simple
examples.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fractal and multifractal functions and the correspond-
ing curves or surfaces are found in numerous places in
nonlinear and nonequillibrium phenomenon. For exam-
ple, isoscalar surfaces for advected scalars in certain tur-
bulence problems [1,2], typical Feynman [3,4] and Brow-
nian paths [5,6], attractors of some dynamical systems [7]
are, among many others, examples of occurence of contin-
uous but highly irregular (nondiﬀerentiable) curves and
surfaces. Velocity ﬁeld of a turbulent ﬂuid [8] at low vis-
cosity is a well-known example of a multifractal function.
Ordinary calculus is inadequate to characterize and han-
dle such curves and surfaces. Some recent papers [9–12]
indicate a connection between fractional calculus [13–15]
and fractal structure [5,6] or fractal processes [16–18].
However the precise nature of the connection between
the dimension of the graph of a fractal curve and frac-
tional diﬀerentiability properties was recognized only re-
cently. A new notion of local fractional derivative (LFD)
was introduced [19,20] to study fractional diﬀerentiability
properties of irregular functions. An intresting observa-
tion of this work was that the local H¨older exponent/
dimension was related to the maximum order for which
LFD existed.
In this paper we brieﬂy review the con-
cept of LFD as applied to a function of one variable and
generalize it for functions of several variables.

An irregular function of one variable is best character-
ized locally by a H¨older exponent. We will use the fol-
lowing general deﬁnition of the H¨older exponent which
has been used by various authors [21,22] recently. The
exponent h(y) of a function f at y is given by h such
that there exists a polynomial Pn(x) of order n, where n
is the largest integer smaller than h, and

|f (x) − Pn(x − y)| = O(|x − y|h),

(1)

for x in the neighbourhood of y. This deﬁnition serves
to classify the behavior of the function at y.

Fractional calculus [13–15] is a study which deals with
generalization of diﬀerentiation and integration to frac-
tional orders. There are number of ways (not neccesarily
equivalent) of deﬁning fractional derivatives and integra-
tions. We use the Riemann-Liouville deﬁnition. We be-
gin by recalling the Riemann-Liouville deﬁnition of frac-
tional integral of a real function, which is given by [13,15]

x

1
Γ(−q) Z
a

dqf (x)
[d(x − a)]q =
where the lower limit a is some real number and of the
fractional derivative

f (y)
(x − y)q+1

dy for q < 0,

(2)

dqf (x)
[d(x − a)]q =

1
Γ(n − q)

x

dn
dxn Z
a

f (y)
(x − y)q−n+1

dy

(3)

for n − 1 < q < n. Fractional derivative of a simple
function f (x) = xp p > −1 is given by [13,15]

dqxp
dxq =

Γ(p + 1)
Γ(p − q + 1)

xp−q

for p > −1.

(4)

Further the fractional derivative has the interesting prop-
erty (see ref [13]), viz,

dqf (βx)

dxq = βq dqf (βx)

d(βx)q

(5)

which makes it suitable for the study of scaling. Note the
nonlocal character of the fractional integral and deriva-
tive in the equations (2) and (3) respectively. Also it is
clear from equation (4) that unlike in the case of integer
derivatives the fractional derivative of a constant is not
zero in general. These two features make the extraction
of scaling information somewhat diﬃcult. The problems
were overcome by the introduction of LFD in [19]. In the
following section we brieﬂy review the notion of LFD for
the real valued functions of real variable. In the section
III we generalize this deﬁnition to real valued functions
of many variables and demonstrate it with the help of
some simple examples.

II. LOCAL FRACTIONAL DIFFERENTIABILITY

Unfortunately, as noted in section I, fractional deriva-
tives are not local in nature. On the other hand it is de-
sirable and occasionally crucial to have local character in
wide range of applications ranging from the structure of
diﬀerentiable manifolds to various physical models. Sec-
ondly the fractional derivative of a constant is not zero,
consequently the magnitude of the fractional derivative
changes with the addition of a constant. The appropriate
new notion of fractional diﬀerentiability must bypass the
hindrance due to these two properties. These diﬃculties
were remedied by introducing the notion LFD in [19] as
follows:

Deﬁnition 1 If, for a function f : [0, 1] → IR, the limit

IDqf (y) = lim
x→y

dq(f (x) − f (y))
d(x − y)q

(6)

exists and is ﬁnite, then we say that the local fractional
derivative (LFD) of order q (0 < q < 1), at x = y, exists.

In the above deﬁnition the lower limit y is treated as
a constant. The subtraction of f (y) corrects for the
fact that the fractional derivative of a constant is not
zero. Whereas the limit as x → y is taken to remove
the nonlocal content. Advantage of deﬁning local frac-
tional derivative in this manner lies in its local nature
and hence allowing the study of pointwise behaviour of
functions. This will be seen more clearly after the devel-
opment of Taylor series below.

Deﬁnition 2 We deﬁne critical order α, at y, as

α(y) = Sup{q | all LFDs of order less than q exist at y}.

These deﬁnitions were subsequently generalized [20] for
q > 1 as follows.

Deﬁnition 3 If, for a function f : [0, 1] → IR, the limit

according to deﬁnitions 2 and 3 is γ. It is clear that the
critical order of the C∞ function is ∞.

In [19] it was shown that the Weierstrass nowhere dif-

ferentiable function, given by

Wλ(t) =

λ(s−2)ksinλkt,

(8)

∞

Xk=1

where λ > 1, 1 < s < 2 and t real, is continuously locally
fractional diﬀerentiable for orders below 2 − s and not
for orders between 2 − s and one. This implies that the
critical order of this function is 2 − s at all points. Inter-
esting consequence of this result is the relation between
box dimension s [6] of the graph of the function and the
critical order. This result has for the ﬁrst time given a
direct relation between the diﬀerentiability property and
the dimension. In fact this observation was consolidated
into a general result showing equivalence between criti-
cal order and the local H¨older exponent of any continu-
ous function. The LFD was further shown to be useful in
the study of pointwise behaviour of multifractal functions
and for unmasking the singularities masked by stronger
singularities.

Whenever it is required to distinguish between limits
from right and left sides we can write the deﬁnition for
LFD in the following form.

IDq

±f (y) = lim
x→y±

dq

FN (x, y)
[d ± (x − y)]q

e

(9)

The importance of the notion of LFD lies in the fact
that it appears naturally in the fractional Taylor’s series
with a remainder term for a real function f , given by,

f (x) =

N

Xn=0

f (n)(y)
Γ(n + 1)

∆n +

IDq
+f (y)
Γ(q + 1)

∆q + Rq(y, ∆)

(10)

where x − y = ∆ > 0 and Rq(y, ∆) is a remainder given
by

IDqf (y) = lim
x→y

dq(f (x) −

N
n=0

f (n)(y)
Γ(n+1) (x − y)n)

P

(11)

exists and is ﬁnite, where N is the largest integer for
which N th derivative of f (x) at y exists and is ﬁnite,
then we say that the local fractional derivative (LFD) of
order q (N < q ≤ N + 1), at x = y, exists.

and

F (y, ∆; q, N ) =

dq(f (x) −

f (n)(y)
Γ(n+1) ∆n)

N
n=0
P
[d∆]q

(12)

We consider this as the generalization of the local deriva-
tive for order greater than one. Note that when q is a
positive integer ordinary derivatives are recovered. The
deﬁnition of the critical order remains the same since,
for q < 1, (6) and (7) agree. This deﬁnition extends
the applicability of LFD to C1−functions which are still
irregular due to the nonexistence of some higher order
derivative (i.e. belong to class Cγ, γ > 1). For example
the critical order of f (x) = a+bx+c|x|γ, γ > 1, at origin,

We note that the local fractional derivative as deﬁned
above (not just fractional derivative), along with the ﬁrst
N derivatives, provides an approximation of f (x) in the
vicinity of y. We further remark that the terms on the
RHS of eqn(10) are nontrivial and ﬁnite only in the case
when q equals α, the critical order. Osler [23] constructed
a fractional Taylor series using usual (Riemann-Liouville)
fractional derivatives which was applicable only to ana-
lytic function. Further Osler’s formulation involves terms

with negative orders also and hence is not suitable for ap-
proximating schemes. When ∆ < 0, a similar expansion
can be written for IDq

−f (y) by replacing ∆ by −∆.

When 0 < q < 1 we get as a special case
IDqf (y)
Γ(q + 1)

f (x) = f (y) +

(x − y)q + Remainder

(13)

provided the RHS exists. If we set q equal to one in equa-
tion (13) one gets the equation of the tangent. All the
curves passing through a point y and having same the
tangent, form an equivalence class (which is modelled by
a linear behavior). Analogously all the functions (curves)
with the same critical order α and the same IDα will form
an equivalence class modeled by the power law xα. This
is how one may generalize the geometric interpretation
of derivatives in terms of tangents. This observation is
useful in the approximation of an irregular function by a
piecewise smooth (scaling) function. One may recognize
the introduction of such equivalence classes as a starting
point for fractional diﬀerential geometry.

III. GENERALIZATION TO HIGHER
DIMENSIONAL FUNCTIONS

The deﬁnition of the Local fractional derivative can be
generalized for higher dimensional functions in the fol-
lowing manner.

Consider a function f : IRn → IR. We deﬁne

Φ(y, t) = f (y + vt) − f (y), v ∈ IRn,

t ∈ IR.

(14)

Then the directional-LFD of f at y of order q, 0 < q < 1,
in the direction v is given (provided it exists) by

IDq

vf (y) =

dqΦ(y, t)
dtq
where the RHS involves the usual fractional derivative of
equation (3). The directional-LFDs along the unit vector
ei will be called ith partial-LFD.

(15)

|t=0

Now let us consider two examples.

Example 1: Let

∞

Xk=1

∞

Xk=1

If we choose y = 0, i.e., we examine fractional diﬀeren-
tiability at a point on x axis and if we choose vy = 0,
i.e., we are looking at LFD in the direction of increasing
x then we get

Φ(x, t) =

λ(s−2)k[sinλk(x + vxt) − sinλk(x)]

which is known [19] to have critical order 2 − s.

If we keep y = 0 but keep vx and vy non-zero, i.e., if we
examine fractional diﬀerentiability at a point on x-axis
but in any direction then we get

Φ(x, t) =

λ(s−2)k[sinλk(x + vxt + vyt) − sinλk(x)]

This again has critical order 2 − s, except when vx = −vy
(in which case it is ∞ since the function Φ identically
vanishes).

In fact it can be shown that the given function has 2−s
as critical order at any point and in any direction except
the direction with vx = −vy.
Example 2: Another example we consider is

Wλ(x) = Wλ(x, y) =

λ(s−2)ksinλk(xy),

(17)

∞

Xk=1

where λ > 1 and 1 < s < 2.

Wλ(x + vt) = Wλ(x + vxt, y + vyt)
∞

=

λ(s−2)ksin(λk(x + vxt)(y + vyt)).

Xk=1

Wλ(x) = Wλ(x, y) =

λ(s−2)ksinλk(x + y),

(16)

=

λ(s−2)k[sin(λk(xy + yvxt + xvyt + vxvyt2))

∞

Xk=1

Φ(x, t) = Wλ(x + vt) − Wλ(x)

∞

Xk=1

−sin(λk(xy))]

with λ > 1 and 1 < s < 2. Let v = (vx, vy) be a unit
2-vector. Then

Wλ(x + vt) = Wλ(x + vxt, y + vyt)
∞

Now if we choose y = 0 and vy = 0 then the critical order
is ∞.

=

λ(s−2)ksinλk(x + vxt + y + vyt).

If we choose y = 0 but vx and vy non-zero then we get

Xk=1

=

∞

Xk=1

Φ(x, t) = Wλ(x + vt) − Wλ(x)

Φ(x, t) =

λ(s−2)k[sin(λk(xvyt + vxvyt2))]

λ(s−2)k[sinλk(x + vxt + y + vyt)

−sinλk(x + y)]

Therefore using results of [19] the critical order along any
other direction v, at a point on x-axis is seen to be 2 − s.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The usefulness of the notion of LFD was pointed out in
[19,20] where the considerations were restricted to func-
tions of one variable only. It allows us to quantify the
loss of diﬀerentiability of fractal and multifractal func-
tions. The larger the irregularity of the functions the
smaller is the extent of diﬀerentiability and smaller is the
value of the H¨older exponent. Local Taylor series expan-
sions provide a way to approximate irregular functions
by a piecewise scaling functions. In the present paper we
have demonstrated that it is possible to carry the same
theme even in the multidimensional case. In particular,
the H¨older exponents in any direction are related to the
critical order of the corresponding directional-LFD. We
note that, whereas a one dimensional result is useful in
studying irregular signals, the results here may have util-
ity in image processing where one can characterize and
classify singularities in the image data. We note that it is
possible to write a multivariable fractional Taylor series
which can be used for approximations and modelling of
multivariable multiscaling functions. This development
will be reported elsewhere. Further these considerations
provide a way for formulating fractional diﬀerential ge-
ometry for fractal surfaces.

ABSTRACT 

In the previous part I, we have developed the generalized theory of the probability tomography method to image 
polar and dipolar sources of a vector or scalar geophysical anomaly field. The purpose of the new method was to 
improve  the  core-and-boundary  resolution  of  the  most  probable  buried  sources  of  the  anomalies  detected  in  a 
datum domain. In this paper, which constitutes the part II of the same study, an application of the new approach 
to the Vesuvius volcano (Naples, Italy) is illustrated in detail by analyzing geoelectrical, self-potential and gravity 
datasets collected over the whole volcanic area. The purpose is to get new insights into the shallow structure and 
hydrothermal system  of  Vesuvius,  and  the deep  geometry  of  the tectonic  depression  within  which the  volcano 
grew. 

likely  made  of  altered  volcanics.  Moreover, a high-to-
low  velocity and resistivity  boundary estimated within 
a 8-10 km depth range beneath the Vesuvius cone has 
been assumed as the top of a magma chamber. Though 
not yet geometrically and structurally well constrained, 
these  features indicate that Vesuvius is still to be  con-
sidered a highly hazardous volcano. 

 

 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 

 
In  the  first  part  of  this  study  (Mauriello  and  Patella, 
2006), from now onward indicated with MP-I, we have 
illustrated the theory of the 3D probability tomography, 
under the assumption that any geophysical dataset can 
be interpreted as the response of a double set of hidden 
sources, schematized as poles and dipoles. Source pole 
and dipole occurrence probability functions (SPOP and 
SDOP, respectively)  were introduced to  obtain a core-
and-boundary imaging of the most probable sources of 
the detected geophysical anomalies. 

In this  second  part, the  results  from  an application 
to the Mt. Somma-Vesuvius volcano (Naples, Italy) are 
presented.  To  avoid  repetitions,  all  previous  equations 
and figures needed to understand this application, will 
be recalled referring to the numbering used in MP-I. 

Geophysics  is  currently  applied  in  volcanology  to 
define the physical and geometric features of a volcanic 
apparatus and to study feeding and plumbing systems. 

Mt.  Somma-Vesuvius  is  among the  most  surveyed 
active volcanoes in the world for the great concern due 
to the high level of urbanization existing all around its 
slopes, closest to the city of Naples. A comprehensive 
collection of the most recent studies about the volcanic 
structure and dynamics is given by Spera et al. (1998). 
The geophysical evidences achieved so far indicate 
that  Vesuvius  grew  inside  a depression  of  a  carbonate 
basement  with  normal  crustal  density,  filled  with  less 
dense sediments. The shallower portion of the volcano 
has been interpreted as a central plumbing system sur-
rounded  by  slowly  cooled  dikes.  The  summit  cone  is

These results were got using standard modeling and 
inversion tools,  except  for  the  geoelectric,  gravity  and 
self-potential data, which were analyzed by the original 
formulation  of  the  SPOP  tomography  (Patella,  1997; 
Patella and Mauriello, 1999; Iuliano et al., 2002). 

In the next sections, we give some new results from 
a joint application of the SPOP and SDOP tomography 
to the geoelectric, self-potential and gravity datasets on 
Vesuvius. 

A  satellite  map  of  the  volcanic  area  and the  zones 
which have  been  investigated  by  the  methods  at  issue 
are reported in figure 1. 

 
 
GEOELECTRIC TOMOGRAPHIES 

 
Figure  2  displays  the  geoelectrical  apparent  resistivity 
(GAR) pseudosections across the S-N (upper) and E-W 
(lower) profiles drawn in figure 1. The GAR data were 
got using bipoles 500 m long. Each value was assigned 
at a pseudodepth equal to half the spacing between the 
centers of the emitting and receiving bipoles, along the 
median axis across the line jointing the two bipoles. Of 
course, this standard rule was  occasionally adjusted to 
account  for  altitude  variations  along  the  profiles.  The 
step-by-step  displacement  of  the  two  bipoles,  together 
with a step-by-step increase of the spacing between the 
two bipoles provided a dense network of data points in 
the vertical pseudosection across each profile.

Figure  4  displays  the  resultant  geoelectrical  SPOP 
tomographies  elaborated  from  the  apparent  resistivity 
pseudosections across the S-N and E-W profiles drawn 
in figure 1. These SPOP images have been drawn using 
the approach by Mauriello and Patella (1999), which in 
the frame of the generalized theory can be reformulated 
as follows.

The  anomaly  field  dataset  is  a  scalar  function  of  x 
and z, where the x-axis is the horizontal straight-line at 
sea level lying in the vertical plane through the survey 
profile and the z-axis is the vertical line, positive down-
wards. The origin is fixed at sea level half-way through 
the survey profile (see  figure 3). The datum-domain is 
a  surface  S  (the  pseudosection),  which  can  be  divided 
in  three  sub-domains,  S1,  S2,  S3,  as  in  figure  3,  where 
top and bottom line topography functions are indicated 
by  zi,t(x)  and  zi,b(x),  i=1,2,3,  respectively.  Referring  to 
(P) 
the definitions of the SPOP and SDOP functions, ηm
(D), respectively, reported in eq.5a and eq.16a in 
and ηnυ
MP-I, the anomaly field function A(x,z) is defined as

where, specifically, ∆ρa(x,z) represents the departure of

the difference between the true resistivity ρm in the m-
th source cell (pole) and the resistivity ρm,0 in the same 
cell imposed by the reference model. The kernel s(x,z), 
which takes the role of scanner function, is represented 
in eq.1 by the Frechet derivative of the synthetic GAR 
function for a perturbation of the resistivity in the m-th 
cell.

positive  nucleus  identifies  a  resistive  structure  likely 
associable to the thick sequence of submarine lavas and 
the underlying carbonatic basement, in agreement with 
the stratigraphy retrieved from the Trecase well, drilled 
by the Italian Oil Agency AGIP. 

In figure 4, the westward shallow negative nucleus 
identifies the core of a conductive structure very likely 
ascribable to a thick aquifer trapped along the western 
slopes  of  the  volcano.  The  weak  positive  nucleus  that 
appears  right  beneath  the  Somma  caldera  eastern  rim 
identifies the core of a resistive body ascribable to the 
dike  previously  outlined.  No  evidence  of  the  central 
obstructed  chimney  can  be  deducted  from  this profile, 
probably because the profile, placed to the south of the 
top  cone  of  Vesuvius,  does  not  cross  the  bowl-shaped 
top terminal part of the volcano central conduit, which 
appears  to  be  slightly  displaced  northwards.  A  further 
shallow negative nucleus appears on the eastern portion 
of  the  section.  It  identifies  the  core  of  a  conductive 
layer very likely ascribable to the aquifer trapped along 
the  eastern  slopes  of  the  volcano.  Finally,  the  eastern 
and central-western deeper positive nucleuses highlight 
the  cores  of  resistive  blocks  likely  referable  to  east  to 
the faulted carbonate slab outcropping a few km inland, 
and in the central part to a pile of  compact lava flows 
overlying  the  said  slab,  gently  downstepping  towards 
the Tyrrhenian sea.

The SPOP tomography across the geoelectrical S-N 
profile  shows  a  very  well  resolved  resistivity  anomaly 
source pattern. Following Patella and Mauriello (1999), 
the northern shallow negative SPOP nucleus identifies 
the core of a conductive structure very likely ascribable 
to marine water-bearing volcano-clastic sediments. The 
following  shallow  central  positive  nucleus,  appearing 
beneath the Mt. Somma caldera northern rim, identifies 
the core of a resistive structure very likely associable to 
a slowly cooled compact magmatic dike. The following 
shallow  negative  nucleus,  located  beneath  the  summit 
part of the Vesuvius central edifice, identifies the core 
of a conductive structure, which leads to admit that the 
volcano  chimney  is  likely  occluded  by  water-rich  and

(D) and ηnz

Only the two derivatives with respect to x and z can 
lead to meaningful results, therefore figure 5 and figure 
(D) tomographies, respectively.

(D) tomography across the S-N geoelectrical 
The ηnx
profile of  figure 5 depicts a resistivity  contrast pattern 
quite compatible with the previous source pole pattern. 
The first notable nucleus is that appearing beneath the 
Mt. Somma – Vesuvius edifice, located exactly amidst 
the adjacent positive-negative shallow SPOP nucleuses 
previously discussed. This nucleus, combined with the 
similar nucleus  appearing  exactly  at  the  same  position 
(D) tomography of figure 6, very likely marks 
in the ηnz
the  existence  of  a  sharp  boundary  separating  the  two 
different  volcanic  structures  associated  to  the  adjacent 
SPOP nucleuses. The opposite sign of these two SDOP 
features and their apparent prolate shape allow the trace 
of the hypothesized sharp boundary to be imaged in the 
section nearly as a leftward downverging segment. The 
(D) tomography  of 
second remarkable  feature  of  the ηnx
figure 5 across the S-N geoelectric profile is the pair of 
negative cores placed southward between the Vesuvius 
summit  cone  and  the Trecase  well. This pair, together 
(D) tomography of 
with the nucleus appearing in the ηnz
figure  6,  in the  same  sector  of  the  section,  very  likely 
demarcate the stepped boundary separating the shallow 
structure  of  the  volcano  from the  underlying  sequence 
of  submarine  lavas  and  carbonates. The  sign  of  the  x- 
and  z-component  of  these  source  dipoles  is  congruent 
with the sign of the source poles located in that portion 
of  the  section.  The  last remarkable  feature  of  the  S-N 
profile is the positive nucleus perched in the northern-
(D) tomography of figure 6, in the 
most sector of the ηnz
P. d’Arco area. It very likely demarcates the horizontal 
boundary  dividing  the  shallow  water-bearing  volcanic 
sediments  from  the  underlying  sequences  of  compact 
volcanics. 

The E-W ηnx

(D) tomography in figure 5 shows only 
a negative, vertically prolate nucleus beneath Vesuvius. 
It very likely highlights a sharp lateral passage from the 
conductive top central part of Vesuvius to the resistive, 
nearly  vertical wall beneath the eastern rim of the Mt. 
Somma caldera, interpreted as a compact magma dyke. 
(D)  tomography  in  figure  6  provides  more 
The  E-W ηnz
information. In fact, the western widely prolate positive 
nucleus may very likely be interpreted as the core of a 
nearly horizontal boundary dividing the shallow water-
bearing volcanic sediments from the underlying pile of 
compact lava flows. Similarly, the eastern positive core 
can  very  likely  be  interpreted  as  the  trace  of  a  nearly 
horizontal  sharp  transition  from  the  superficial  water-
bearing volcanic sequence to the underlying carbonatic 

platform. Finally, the deep negative nucleus in the E-W 
tomography of figure 6 can be associated to the core of 
the horizontal transition from a pile of compact lavas to 
a fractured and altered block of the carbonatic slab. 
 
 

SELF-POTENTIAL TOMOGRAPHIES 

 
A set of 1250 self-potential (SP) data was collected by 
the gradient technique displacing a 100 m long passive 
bipole  continuously  along  a  mesh  of  circuits  covering 
an area of 12×12 km2 (see figure 1). In figure 7, the top 
horizontal slice shows the original SP map in mV. 

In the case of SP fields, referring to definition given 
by eq.1 in MP-I, the A(r) vector function is represented 
by the steady natural electric field vector on the ground 
and the SPES vector function s(r,rm) is explicated as

eq.5 and eq.6 in MP-I, and the SDOP function ηnυ
eq.16 and eq.17 in MP-I, applying the topography sur-
face regularization function given by eq.12 in MP-I. 

In  figure  7,  the  left-hand  panel  displays  the  SPOP 
tomography. In the top slice, a negative closed nucleus 
appears right in correspondence of the Vesuvius upper 
cone, circled by positive cores extending downslope to 
0,4 km a.s.l., which appear to closely delineate the Mt. 
Somma caldera rim, mostly its northeastern and south-
western  arcs.  At  sea  level,  a  positive  nucleus  appears 
again in correspondence of the Vesuvius cone, together 
with sequences of aligned positive nucleuses indicating 
the  main  radial  fractures  system  crossing  the  volcanic 
area. Finally, a roughly circular distribution of positive 
nucleuses,  at  sea  level,  appears  to  highlight  the  outer 
boundary of the volcanic area. This positive pattern at 
sea  level  is  accompanied  by  weak  negative  cores  that 
occupy the intermediate positions and reach the highest 
values in the slice at 0.4 km of depth b.s.l., first of all 
that in the northwestern sector. 

As is well documented, in hydrothermal systems SP 
signals are caused by electrokinetic and thermoelectric 
effects. Generally, in volcanic areas, positive anomalies 
correspond to upward migrating fluids, while negative 
anomalies to downward fluid movement (Zlotnicki and 
Nishida, 2003). Accepting such a model, the top central 
negative nucleus would outline the position of the main 
path for meteoric waters infiltration, in correspondence 
with  the  Vesuvius  crater.  The  inner  crown  of  positive 
cores would instead indicate the sites of thermal fluids 
uprise.  This  feature  might  thus  represent  the  signature 
of a fluid convection mechanism within a thermal field 
localized above sea level inside the mountain. 

The outer crown of positive cores together with the 
positive  radial  trends  at  sea  level,  may,  as  previously,

fluids.  Accordingly,  the  negative  nucleuses  wedged  at

likely to indicate the cores  of deep alimentation zones 
within  a  larger  thermal  convection  system  extended

to x and y can bring to fruitful results. The most evident

occurring in both piles indicates that the corresponding 
nucleuses belong to the same source dipole.

GRAVITY TOMOGRAPHIES 

 
The Bouguer residual gravity map within the Vesuvius 
area, drawn in the top slice of figure 9, was elaborated 
by Cassano and La Torre (1987) by means of 1850 data 
distributed with an average density of 1 station per km2 
within an area of 26.6×37 km2. A density of 2.3 g/cm3 
was used for slab and terrain corrections and a S35°W 
trend of 0.9 mgal/km was subtracted from the original 
values. The main large-scale features are a wide gravity 
low, extending from the northwestern side to the whole 
central area, and a gravity high bordering the negative 
anomaly along the northeastern and southern sectors of 
the map. The gravity low represents quite well the huge 
structural  depression  within  which  the  whole  volcanic 
activity grew, while the gravity high closely depicts the 
structural highs consisting of the carbonate massifs that 
border the Campanian plain and reach southwestwards 
the whole Sorrento peninsula (Principe et al., 1987). 

The  sequences  of  slices  in  figure  9  display  the  3D 
tomography  of  the  SPOP  function,  where  the  source 
poles  are  assimilated  to  the  centers  of  mass  of  bodies 
with either a surplus or a deficit of mass (∆-mass) with 
respect  to  the hosting medium.  In the  gravity  method, 
A(r) represents the scalar Bouguer anomaly dataset (i.e. 
the  z-component  of  the  gravity  field)  and  the  scalar

less defined nucleuses. Two denser blocks appear at the 
eastern  and  southern  margins  of  the  tomospace.  Both 
nucleuses have a very limited extent from 1.6 km b.s.l. 
down to 2 km b.s.l..

eastern  parts  of  the  survey  area. The northern,  eastern

and southern lateral boundaries of this volume are well 
outlined down to at least 3-4 km b.s.l.. The sign of the 
SDOP nucleuses reflects the sign of the dipole moment 
components,  conformably  to  the  coordinate  reference 
plane (x- and y-axis positive eastwards and northwards, 
respectively). 

 
 

CONCLUSION 

 
An  application  of  the  probability  tomography  method 
to the Vesuvius volcano (Naples, Italy), to image polar 
and  dipolar  sources  of  the  geoelectrical,  self-potential 
and gravity anomaly datasets collected  over the whole 
volcanic area, has been shown. 

The most important results that have been achieved 

can be synthesized as follows: 
1.  a slowly cooled compact magmatic dike is likely to 
exist beneath the Mt. Somma caldera northern rim; 
2.  the  Vesuvius  conduit  is  likely  to  be  occluded  by 

water-rich and mineral-rich fine deposits; 

3.  a thick water-bearing horizon is likely to be trapped 
along the western and eastern slopes of the volcano; 
4.  a fluid convection mechanism is likely to be active 
within a thermal field located above sea level inside 
the Somma-Vesuvius mountain; 

5.  a larger thermal convection system extended below 
the whole volcanic area is likely to exist in the first 
0.5 km b.s.l.; 

6.  the whole Mt. Somma-Vesuvius volcanic apparatus 
is  likely  to  be  emplaced  in  a  very  large  and  thick 
tectonic depression. 
We remark that, generally, the areas where the ηm

(P) 
(D)  functions  reach  the  highest  absolute  values 
and  ηn
are,  from  a  probabilistic  point  of  view,  the  candidate 
places  where  to  hypothesize  the  presence  of  the  core-
and-boundary sources of the anomalies observed in the 
datum  space.  In  the  Somma-Vesuvius  area,  the  SPOP 
and  SDOP  nucleuses  with  the  highest  absolute  values 
appear,  in  fact,  as  the  most  suitable  places  where  to 
ascribe  the  features  listed  above.  We  do  not  exclude, 
however,  that  other  points  in  the  tomospace,  even  if 
(P) and  
characterized  by  lower  absolute  values  of  theηm
 

Geophysical tomography. The Vesuvius case-history 

(D)  functions,  if  properly  combined  can  represent  a 
ηn
potential  source  model  compatible  with  the  observed 
anomaly  field  and  acceptable  from  the  volcanological 
point of view.

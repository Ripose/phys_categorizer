Abstract  

 
 
 
 
The excitation of wakefields by a triangular temporal profile laser pulse with an abrupt fall in a 

step density profile plasma channel is investigated analytically and an exact solution is obtained.  
t p, where t  is the rise time of the pulse and t p is the plasma 
The excitation is more efficient for t  ~
period, though it is still significant for t  ~ 20 t p. The wake potential in the former case is 1.7 times 
the  ponderomotive  potential,  whereas  it  falls  to  1.4  times  the  ponderomotive  potential  for  the 

latter.

Introduction 

I. 
 
In  linear  accelerators,  the  accelerating  gradients  are  severely  limited  due  to  the  breakdown. 

Hence,  the  necessity  to  use  an  already  ionized  medium  capable  of  sustaining  very high electric 

fields,  has  been  felt.  Many  schemes  have  been  considered  to  excite  large  amplitude  plasma 

waves,  viz.,  the  beat-wave,  the  plasma  wake- field  and  the      laser  wake-field  accelerators,  to 

achieve  high  acceleration  gradients  [1,2].  However,  the  energy  gain  of  the  accelerated  charged 

particle is reduced due to diffraction, for the plasma acts as a dielectric medium. To increase the 

acceleration energy gain, guiding of the laser pulse is needed[3]. 

In this note, we address the issue of excitation of plasma wake-fields by a laser pulse propagating 

in a step density profile plasma channel.  

Formulation 

II. 
We consider a non evolving laser pulse of frequency  w

abrupt fall, propagating in a plasma channel. The evolution of the cold and collision less plasma 

is governed by the linearized continuity and momentum equations along with Poisson’s equation;

III.  Discussion 

After  the  pulse  is  gone,  the  Langmuir  wave  is  produced  and  its  potential  is  brought  to  an 
amplitude that depends on  t . The value of  t   yielding  maximum  value  of 

 at the instant the 

0

pulse is gone, is  t
Ref.(4)), we obtain  t  ~

p1 ~ 4.5. Hence, if we consider a channel depth of ( n002-n001)/n002 ~ 50% (see 
~ 20t p we 
still  have  a  wave  excited  with  an  amplitude  at  the  moment  the  pulse  is  gone  given  by 

/w p2. It is to be pointed out however, that for t

The excited wave has a potential

However,  for  long  pulses,  a  sensitive  plasma  wave  generation  is  expected  as  well.  It  may  be 
noted also that the amplitude of the wave is modulated at a frequency ~

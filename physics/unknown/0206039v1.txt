Abstract 

We  have  demonstrated  that  small  gap  (0.1  to  0.4 mm)  RPCs  made  of  low  resistivity 
materials (r <108 W
(cid:215) cm) can operate at counting rates of up to 105 Hz/mm2 with position 
resolutions better than 50 m m. Results of preliminary tests allow us to suggest a possible 
application of this new type of RPC for tracking.

I. 

Introduction 

In a previous work [1] we have demonstrated that a very good position resolution (better 
than 50 m m) may be achieved for X-ray detection (6-30 keV) using a small gap (below 
0.5mm)  RPC  with  the  cathode  covered  with  a  CsI  secondary  electron  emitter.  In  a 
subsequent  work  [2]  we  succeeded  to  considerably  improve  the  counting  rate 
characteristics of the RPC by using low resistive materials for its electrodes. In this work 
we aims to: 

1) combine both approaches and develop a high rate and position resolution RPC; 

2) investigate the possibility of applying this type of RPC for tracking in High-Energy 
Physics experiments. 

II. 

Experimental set up 

The experimental set up (Fig.1) consisted of an aluminium gas container inside which 
various RPC designs (with sizes 5· 5cm2 and 10· 10cm2) could be installed and tested. To 
minimize the voltage drop across the resistive plates and achieve good rate characteristics 
the cathodes were manufactured from low resistivity materials, for example Pestov glass 
(r ~109 W
(cid:215) cm) [5] 
and Si (r
(cid:215) cm) [5]. The anode electrode was manufactured from Pestov glass 
(r ~1010 W cm). The inner (gas side) faces of the anode electrodes had Chromium readout 
strips  deposited  at  either  30  or  50 m m  pitch,  allowing  highly  accurate  position 
measurements.  

(cid:215) cm) [3], conductive plastics (r =106-108 W
 =10-2-104 W

(cid:215) cm) [4], GaAs (r =10-1-108 W

Two main designs were used. The first design had 20 or 30 readout strips in the central 
region of the anode and the rest of the anode was metalised. The second design had strips 
over  the  whole  area,  being  the  strips  in  the  central  region  connected  to  individual 
amplifiers  whereas  the  others  were  connected  in  groups.  The  gap  between  electrodes 
could be varied from 0.1 to 0.5 mm. 

Before assembling the RPCs they were first ultrasonically cleaned in a solution of dish 
soap  and  distilled  water  and  then  ultrasonically  cleaned  several  times  in  distilled 
deionised water to remove dust and any other microparticles attached to the surfaces. The 
test chamber was also carefully cleaned in the same way. Gas pipes were equipped with 
3 m m  microparticle  filters.  Tests  were  performed  in  Ar,  Kr  and  Xe-based gas mixtures 
with various quenchers (CO2, ethane, isobutane, alcohol and tetrafluoroethane†) and their 
combinations. The percentages of each component were widely varied. 
Ionisation  tracks  inside  the  RPC  were  produced  by  cosmic  muons,  b -particles  and  by 
high energy (>20keV) X-ray generated photoelectrons. Cosmic muons were identified by 
coincidences with the signals from two scintillators (see Fig.1). 
Some position resolution measurements were performed with  b -particles from  106Ru or 
90Sr sources. The particles penetrated to the RPC through a 100 m m lead slit placed on the 
                                                             
† C2H2F4, commercially known as R134a. 

outer  cathode  surface  (see  details  in  Fig2).  The  cathode  region  around  the  slit  had  a 
thickness  of  10 m m  only  and  its  inner  part  was  covered  with  a  porous  CsI  secondary 
electron emitter, 5 to 10 m m thick for increasing the number of primary electrons created 
near  the  cathode  [6].  However,  porous  CsI  emitters  are  easily  charged  up  and  can 
therefore be only used at low rates, typically <103Hz/cm2. 

Position  resolution  measurements  were  also  made  with  X-ray generated photoelectron 
tracks.  The  incoming  photons  were  collimated  by  a  30 m m  wide  slit  oriented 
perpendicularly  to  the  electrode  planes,  which  could  be  moved  perpendicularly  to  the 
strips with an accuracy of a few m m. The slit was illuminated by an X-ray gun able to 
produce in excess of 105 counts/mm2 in the detector volume. In most measurements the 
cathode was covered with a uniform layer (0.3 - 0.4 m m thick) of CsI [1,6], which does 
not  exhibit  any  strong  charging  up  effect.  If  X-ray  photons  enter  the  CsI  emitter  at  a 
shallow  angle,  there  will  be  a  sizable  absorption  probability,  while  at  the  same  time 
secondary  electrons  created  after  the  X-ray  absorption  can  be  easily  emitted  in  to  the 
detector volume [1]. Counters with cathodes not coated with the CsI layer were tested as 
well. 

Avalanche-generated  signals  from  the  RPCs  were  measured  at  low  rates  with  charge 
sensitive amplifiers, while current amplifiers were used at high rates and for discharge 
studies.  

III.  Results 

III.1 Gain-rate characteristics of RPCs made of GaAs and Si 

As was shown in [2], the use of low resistivity materials for the RPC electrodes allows 
one  to  reach  a  high  counting  rate  and  simultaneously  ensure  the  protection  of  the 
electronics from damage in case of occasional discharges. In this work we have mostly 
used GaAs and Si, which were first reported for RPCs in [5]. In Fig.3 gain vs. rate curves 
for  low  resistivity  RPCs  made  of  GaAs  and  Si  are  presented,  as  well  as  the  maximum 
achievable gain for the metallic parallel-plate avalanche chamber (PPAC). One can see 
that at gains above 104, counting rates can be achieved up to 105 Hz/mm2. In principle 
one can run the counters at much higher gains but at the expense of a lower achievable 
rate  (Fig.  3).  In  any  case,  the  GaAs  and  Si-based  RPCs  both  reach  the,  in  principle 
insurmountable, rate limits of a metallic PPAC. However it should be noted that the rate 
limits for PPACs and RPCs might be set by different mechanisms (see next section and 
[7, 8] for more details). 

III-2. Discharges and their suppression in high-rate RPCs 

As  was  shown  in  our  previous  studies,  the  maximum  achievable  gain  in  PPACs  with 
metallic electrodes drops with increasing counting rate due to spark discharges [8]. It was 
found  that  the  same  is  true  for  RPCs  with  low  resistivity  electrodes  (<104 W
(cid:215) cm). 
However, the breakdown characteristics of a “medium” resistivity RPC is very different 
from  the  metallic  PPAC  or  the  high  resistivity  RPC.  In  the  resistivity  range 
107-108 W
(cid:215) cm, a new phenomenon - a continuous glow discharge – appears [2]. From the 
point of view of possible electronics damage, this type of discharge could be in some 

cases even more dangerous than the sparks. To identify the conditions at which sparks or 
glow discharges occur we performed studies with a wide range of electrode resistivities 
in various gas mixtures with a quencher concentration lower than 20%. The results of 
such measurements are summarized in Fig 4. 

It was also found that the duration of the glow discharge can be decreased to a fraction of 
m s or even fully suppressed by using highly quenched mixtures, for example a high (20-
25%) concentration of ethane in argon. Note for comparison that in the sparking region 
highly quenched mixtures do not have any effect [9].  

III.3 Position resolution 

III-3a) Results with cosmic rays 

As  an  example,  Fig.5  shows  signals  from  three  adjacent  anode  strips  obtained  in 
coincidence  with  signals  from  two  scintillators.  In  ~30%  of  the  cases  the  large  signal 
appears mainly on one of the strips, in 40% on two strips and in 30% of the cases in more 
than  two  strips.  These  results  suggest  that  a  rather  good  position  resolution  with 
minimum ionising particles should be achievable. 

III-3b) Results with bb particles 

Fig. 6 shows the induced charge profile for b particles penetrating to the RPC through a 
100 m m  slit,  with  a  FWHM  of  ~300 m m.  A  constant  level  background  was  subtracted 
from the points and the peak value normalized.) 

One  should  note  that  the  b  particles  strongly  scatter  in  the  collimator  and  cathode 
material and thus the effective collimation width for the penetrating particles could be 
larger than 100 m m. 
III-3c) Results obtained with photoelectron tracks at rates up to 105Hz/mm2. 

Photoelectrons  generated  by  energetic  X-rays  have  a  mean  free  path  in  Ar,  Kr,  Xe  at 
atmospheric pressure up to 2 or 3 mm [10, 11] and thus can be used to simulate charged-
particle tracks. The main advantages of this method are that X-rays are much easier to 
collimate than b particles and that intense artificial sources are available, allowing the use 
of narrow slits. 
Fig. 6  shows  the  induced  charge  profile  when  a  well-collimated  X-ray  beam  (30 m m 
width)  was  introduced  to  the  amplification  gap  parallel  to  the  cathode,  approximately 
50 m m apart from its surface and the beam oriented along the anode strips. The profile 
width is ~200 m m FWHM. 

Fig. 7a  shows  the  number  of  counts  from  various  strips  (a  digital  image)  for  the  same 
irradiation conditions described in the previous paragraph. Fig. 7b shows the image of the 
same slit shifted by 25 microns in a direction perpendicular to the strips. The pattern is 
periodically repeated when the beam is further moved across the strips. From the image 
contrast  (ratio  of  counts  from  neighbouring  strips)  one  can  conclude  that  a  position 
resolution better than 30 m m was achieved.  
Fig. 7c  shows  the  image  of  a  7 lp/mm  phantom:  three  slits  70 m m  apart  were  easily 
resolved.  

Note that due to the anti-parallax feature of the parallel plate gas amplification structure, 
in which the maximum multiplication is obtained only for the electrons created near the 
cathode, almost the same position resolution was achieved without a CsI converter as in 
Fig. 7 a) and b).  

IV.  Conclusions and Outlook 

We have demonstrated that a small gap RPC made of low resistive materials combines a 
high counting rate capability (up to 105 Hz/mm2 at gains up to 105), approaching that of 
metallic  PPACs,  with  an  extremely  good  position  resolution  (aprox.30 m m)  and  still 
providing efficient electronics protection. This excellent position accuracy was obtained 
in  a  simple  counting  (digital)  mode  without  using  any  analogue  interpolation  method. 
Also note that small gap RPCs enjoy extremely good timing properties (~50 ps s [12]). 
All these characteristics make small gap RPCs potentially competitive to other detectors 
in many applications, for example in medical imaging [13], biology, crystallography and 
also possibly as a high-rate tracking device.

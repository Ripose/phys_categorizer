Abstract 

A number of recent works have concentrated on a few statistical properties of complex networks, 
such  as  the  clustering,  the  right-skewed  degree  distribution  and  the  community,  which  are 
common  to  many  real  world  networks.  In  this  paper,  we  address  the  hierarchy  property  sharing 
among a large amount of networks. Based upon the eigenvector centrality (EC) measure, a method 
is proposed to reconstruct the hierarchical structure of a complex network. It is tested on the Santa 
Fe  Institute  collaboration  network,  whose  structure  is  well  known.  We  also  apply  it  to  a 
Mathematicians’ collaboration network and the protein interaction network of Yeast. The method 
can detect significantly hierarchical structures in these networks.

Very  diverse  systems  in  different  research  fields  can  be  described  as  complex  networks,  i.e., 

connecting  the  nodes  together  by  the  edges  with  nontrivial  topological  structures  [1].  Detailed 

works have been focused on several distinctive statistical properties sharing among a large amount 

of  real  world  networks,  to  cite  examples,  the  clustering  effect  [2,3],  the  right-skewed  degree 

distribution [4,5,6], and the community structure ([7] and for a recent review see Ref. [8]), etc. In 

this paper we consider another property sharing among many networks, the hierarchical structure 

of a complex network.       

Hierarchy, as one common feature for many real world  networks, attracts special attentions in 

recent years [9-12]. In a network, there are usually some groups of nodes, where the nodes in each 

group  are  highly  interconnected  with  each  other,  while  there  are  few  or  no  links  between  the 

groups.  These  groups  can  induce  high  degree  of  clustering,  which  can  be  measured  with  the 

connectivity  probability  for  a  pair  of  the  neighbors  of  one  node.  This  property  coexists  usually 

with the right-skewed degree distributions. The coexistence of these two properties tells us that the 

groups  should  combine  into  each  other  in  a  hierarchical  manner.  Hierarchy  is  one  of  the  key 

aspects of a theoretical model [9,13] to capture the statistical characteristics of a large number of 

real  networks,  including  the  metabolic  [14,15],  the  protein  interaction  [16,17]  and  some  social 

networks [18-20].   

In literature, several concepts are proposed to measure the hierarchy in a network, such as the 

hierarchical  path  [10],  the  scaling  law  for  the  clustering  coefficients  of  the  nodes  [9],  the 

hierarchical components/degree [11], etc. These measures can tell us the existence and the extent 

of  hierarchy  in  a  network.  We  address  herein  another  problem,  that  is,  how  to  reconstruct  the 

hierarchical structure in a network. If the nodes are positioned randomly in the topological map of 

a complex network, it is hard for us to find the hierarchical structure, even for a regular network. 

For  a  real  network,  there  are  some  shortcuts  disturb  the  simple  structure.  Reconstructing  the 

hierarchical structure is clearly a nontrivial task. 

  Consider a network represented with the adjacent matrix  A , the element

ijA   is  1   and  0   if 

the nodes  i   and 

j   are connected and disconnected, respectively. The eigenvector centrality 

(EC) [21,22] is employed as the proxy of importance of each node. Denote the eigenvector 

corresponding to the principal eigenvalue of this adjacency matrix with 

e

principal

, the eigenvector 

centrality of the  i ’s node is the  i ’s component of 

e

principal

, i.e., 

EC i
( )

=

N e
0

principal

2

, 

i
( )

where 

0N   is the number of the nodes. This measure simulates a mechanism in which each node 

affects all of its neighbors simultaneously.   

For  a  simple  network  containing  only  one  group,  the  intra-group  hierarchical  structure  can  be 

detected by calculating EC values for all the nodes. Fig.1 and Fig.2 illustrate the EC values for the 

nodes in a Cayley-tree network. This measure can find the treelike structure exactly, based upon 

which  the  schematic  illustration  can  be  reconstructed  in  detail.  To  represent  the  hierarchical 

structure, we can catalogue the nodes in one group into several levels according to their EC values. 

The edges between the neighboring levels and between the nodes in a same level can be reserved 

as the initial structure, while the other edges can be regarded as shortcuts.   

But  this  procedure  may  induce  fatal  mistakes  in  dealing  with  complex  networks.  Consider  a 

general  condition  where  several  subordinate  groups  are  connected  loosely  with  a  central  group. 

The  EC  values  obtained  from  the  original  adjacent  matrix  reflect  mainly  the  structure  of  the 

central group. The EC values of the nodes in the subordinate groups will tend to vanish, because 

there  are  few  nonzero  elements  between  the  central  group  and  the  subordinate  groups  in  the 

corresponding  adjacent  matrix.  Hence,  the  subordinate  groups  will  be  lost  if  we  detect  the  key 

nodes with the EC values of the original adjacent matrix only. To resolve this problem, we should 

remove the found key nodes from the original adjacent matrix and calculate the EC values of the 

left  nodes  to  find  the  possibly  lost  key  nodes.  Hence  a  proper  procedure  can  be  illustrated  as 

Calculate the EC values for all the nodes from the original adjacent matrix 

1A . Introducing a 

critical  EC  value, 

EC

crit

g= (cid:215)

max(

EC

)

,  the  nodes  whose  EC  values  are  larger  than 

EC  
crit

can be regarded as the key  nodes. We can adjust the parameter  g   in the range of  [0,1] . Then 

remove  the  found  key  nodes  from  the  initial  adjacent  matrix  and  obtain  a  new  adjacent  matrix 

follows. 

2A .   

Iteration of this step leads to some sets of keys nodes as, 

mS n m
( )

=

0,1, 2,3,

,

M

  and the 

corresponding  adjacent  matrix, 

mA m

=

1, 2,3,

,

M

.  Here, 

mS n   is  the  set  containing  n  

( )

(cid:215)
(cid:0)
(cid:0)
key  nodes  found  at  the  m ’th  step.  Each  set  of  key  nodes  can  form  a  backbone  in  the 

corresponding  group.  Catalogue  the  nodes  in  each  set  into  several  levels  we  can  obtain  the 

intra-group structure. Generally, we can sort the key nodes in each group in an ascending way. 

To terminate the detecting procedure we should design a criterion. Define the average number of 

edges per key node, and the average number of edges per left node as, 

D m
(
key

)

=

K m
(
key
N m

                                                  (1) 

where 

keyK m   and 
)

(

keyN m   are the edges between the key nodes and the total number of the 

)

(

key  nodes  found  up  to  the  m ’th  step,  respectively.  The  terminate  criterion  can  be  designed  as 

c

leftD .  Once  the  average  edges  per  left  node 

leftD m   decreases  to 

(

D m D(cid:0)

(

c

,  the 

procedure is terminated.   

By  the  above  procedure  we  can  find  the  global  hierarchy  and  the  intra-group  hierarchy 

simultaneously.  As  an  example,  we  consider  the  largest  component  of  the  Santa  Fe  Institute 

collaboration network [23]. It contains  118   scientists working in four divisions of disciplinary. 

There are  192   edges between these nodes. The first set of key nodes is the four nodes with red 

colors  (as  shown  in  Fig.3).  They  are  the  central  nodes  connecting  the  left  groups  together.  The 

solid  circles  with  different  colors  are  the  key  nodes  in  the  subgroups.  The  open  circles  are  the 

nodes omitted in the detection for their being nonessential in the subgroups. These omitted nodes 

are basically in the skirts of the subgroups and the degrees of some nodes are just  1. The adjacent 

matrix for the key nodes in Fig.4 shows that there are seldom connections between the subgroups. 

The central group (node 1,2,3 and 4) connects the subgroups together. In each subgroup there are 

one  or  two  central  nodes  connecting  the  other  intra-group  nodes  tightly.  A  significant  hierarchy 

property can be detected. The average edge number in the initial network is about  1.63 , the value 

of the criterion is chosen as, 

c

keyD =

1.5

. The parameter  g   is assigned the value of  0.1 .   

The  Erdos  Number  Project  homepage  [24]  provide  a  mathematicians’  collaboration  network 

containing  6927  nodes  connected  with  12864  edges.  The  parameters 

c

keyD and  g   are  assigned 

the  values  of  1.5   and  0.1 ,  respectively.  In  Fig.5  we  can  find  that  the  nodes  from  1  to  200 

-
-
condensed  into  several  central  groups,  the  intra-group  nodes  are  tightly  connected  and  there  are 

many connections between these central groups. These central groups connected all the subgroups 

together.  In  each  subgroup  there  are  some  central  nodes  connecting  the  other  intra-group  nodes 

tightly.  A  significant  hierarchy  property  can  be  detected.  The  most  sub-groups  are  very  small. 

Fig.6 presents the average numbers of edges per key node and per left node. It shows that all the 

groups form globally a tight-connected backbone of the initial network. 

In the protein interaction network of Yeast [25] some key nodes in each group connected tightly 

to  form  a  core.  Though  significant  intra-group  structures  can  be  found,  there  is  not  a  global 

hierarchical structure, as shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8   

In summary, by means of the EC measure we propose a new method to reconstruct the hierarchy 

property  in  a  complex  network.  The  hierarchical  structure  in  two  real  world  collaboration 

networks can be detected effectively. Omitting the skirt nodes, we can draw a hierarchy-structured 

backbone of a network. The skirt nodes can be regarded as perturbations. 

Besides of the ability to detect effectively the hierarchy property, this method can also provide 

useful information in identifying communities in a large network. The low level subgroups should 

be corresponding to the cores of the communities. It provides the importance of each node in each 

core in detail.

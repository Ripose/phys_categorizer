The Probability Distribution Function (PDF) Pn(n) of the particle density at the edge 

of  several  magnetic  fusion  devices,  including  tokamaks,  stellarators,  and  linear 

devices, is known to be strongly non-gaussian. In this paper we present experimental 

results  from  RFX  Reversed  Field  Pinch  [G.  Rostagni,  Fus.  Eng.  Design  25,  301 

(1995)], confirming the universal shape of  Pn also for RFP’s. An explanation for the 

form  of  Pn  is  attempted,  on  the  basis  of  simple  conservation  equations.  The  model 

result  is  shown  to  fitted  fairly  well  empirical  data  in  a  few  different  experimental

I. Introduction 

Transport  in  magnetically  confined  plasmas  is  known  to  be  strongly  influenced  by 

turbulent processes at the edge. Hence, investigating the nature and the origin of the 

turbulence is mandatory for performance improvements in these devices. 

It  is  known  since  years  that  edge  turbulence  is  mainly  electrostatic.  A  statistical 

analysis of main edge plasma parameters (density, potential, temperature, …) reveals  

that  they  exhibit large bursty fluctuations, dubbed “intermittency”. Attention rapidly 

moved to the study of these bursty events, owing to their importance for the transport: 

an  investigation  in  the  Reversed  Field  Pinch  (RFP)  configuration  showed  that, 
although  relatively  rare,  they  carry  more  than  50%  of  total  flux  losses1.  Similar 
figures are valid also for tokamaks2,3 and linear devices4. These intermittent events are 

nowadays associated to coherent structures moving into a background plasma.  

Indeed,  although  bidimensional  arrays  of  probes  are  being  increasingly  popular  in 
order  to  get  snapshots  of  the  full  spatial  structure  of  these  structures5,6,  most  of  the 

investigations  are  still  being  carried  on  through  high-sampling-frequency  point-wise 

measurements  using  Langmuir  probes.  The  data  are  collected  in  the  form  of  a  time 

series, and then analyzed using various statistical tools.  
Because of its direct connection with transport, particle flux Γ attracts a large fraction 

of investigations. Under  the hypothesis of electrostatic turbulence, Γ ∝ n ∇φ, with n 

density  and  φ  plasma  potential.  Hence,  it  is  these  two  quantities  that  are  ultimately 

being studied. Particle density PDFs (Pn), in particular, were studied by Antar et al in 
a  number  of  devices,  showing  their  universal  shape,  valid  for  all  experiments4,7,8. 
Similar results were found also by Budaev et al9. 

Usually, one is not interested as much to the absolute value of one parameter X as to 
its fluctuation: empirically,  to the quantity  δX=  X -<X>, where  <…> stands for  the 

mean value over the experimental points. The parameter X here may stand for plasma 

potential,  temperature,  magnetic  field,  flux,  or  particle  density.  In  the  lack  of 

underlying physics mechanisms which correlate fluctuations between them, different 

measurements  of  X  are  independent  between  them  and  hence  expected  to  yield  a 
gaussian PDF for δX. Experimentally, however, things are different: by example, the 

issue of the departure from normality  was  extensively investigated for  potential and 

magnetic field fluctuations within the long-standing debate about the ultimate origin 
of edge turbulence (Self Organized Criticality-SOC10-13-or fluid turbulence14,15).

In this work we will focus on density, whose fluctuations are strongly non-gaussian, 

too.  This,  together  with  the  already  mentioned  universal  features  between  different 

experiments,  calls  for  the  existence  of  some  underlying  mechanism  of  general 

validity, whose investigation could be of importance.  

The purpose of this work is threefold:  

a)  first  of  all,  we  will  present  density  data  from  the  Reversed  Field  Experiment 
(RFX)16. Their PDF very accurately reproduces the shape found from Antar et al, thus 

adding  another  confirmation  to  its  “universal”  behaviour  (i.e.,  independent  of  the 

magnetic configuration). We  will mainly  refer to  data collected by  using  “standard” 

Langmuir probes, but will also make a brief reference to independent measurements 

taken using filters monitoring the CII 5150 Å line. Although, as explained later, these 

data  are  not  suitable  candidates  to  our  analysis,  they  do  seem  to  qualitatively 

corroborate  our  results.  Spectroscopic  diagnostics  are  not  routinely  used  to  monitor 

turbulence, hence the data presented here are an interesting example of the potential 

capabilities of this kind of measurements.  

b) Second, some comments are advanced about the requirements that any physically 

meaningful Pn must fulfil. In the light of these remarks, the suggested Pn by Antar et 

al is re-examined; an alternative PDF is suggested and compared against real data.  

c) Finally, an interpretation for this PDF is attempted in terms of basic physics. 

   

II. Measurements 

A. Langmuir probes 

The  experimental  set-up  used  for  these  measurements  has  been  described  in  detail 

elsewhere:  see,  e.g.,  Ref.  [17].  Here,  we  limit  to  some  basic  informations:  the 

sampling  frequency  of  the  probe  was  1  MHz,  with  a  total  of  about  40,000 

measurement  points  for  each  shot.  It  is  well  known  that  density  measurement  using 

Langmuir  probes  can  be  potentially  spoiled  by  the  fact  that  one  is  not  actually 
measuring density but the saturation current: Is∝ n×T1/2. However, in the light of the 

square root dependence and of the smallness of temperature fluctuations in RFX, we 

are allowed to neglect the temperature contribution. Data were collected into the RFX 

Scrape Off Layer (SOL).

The  output  time  series  was  binned  to  give  the  PDF  of  Fig.  1.  This  figure  can  be 

compared  against  Fig.  4  of  Ref.  [7]  or  Fig.  3  of    Ref.  [8].  The  agreement  is 

remarkable.  

We want to stress that, in the Figure, we have plotted the PDF of the density n, not of 
its fluctuations δn. The difference may appear trivial, summing up numerically to an 

offset. However, conceptually, it makes a difference: indeed, along this paper, we will 

attempt to show that it is the former, not the latter, the physically relevant variable.  

B. Spectroscopic filters 

Filters centered around the 5150 Å wavelength monitored the corresponding CII line 

evolution  at  four  spatial  locations.  Passive  spectroscopy  can  only  give  line-of-sight 

integrated measurements, but owing to typical RFX temperature and density profiles, 

CII is likely to exist only at the very edge. Sampling frequency is here just  ffilters = 1/8 

MHz. This, together with the issue of stationarity of the data, limited the amount of 

samples available to rather short time series: typically,  2-3000 points for each shot. 

Under the hypothesis of detailed balance, the number of  emitted 5150 Å  photons is 

equal to the number of electron collisional excitations from the ground state: I(5150 
Å) = nCII×ne×Q(T). Here, again, we have a mixed dependence from plasma density ne 

as  well  as  from  the  temperature  T  through  the  rate  coefficient  Q;  it  has  to  be 

simplified under the supplementary hypotheses of small T fluctuations and/or weak T 

dependence in Q (both hypotheses rather well fulfilled at the edge of RFX).  Hence, 

we choose to omit once again the T dependence and identify fairly simply  I(5150 Å) 
↔ ne. Of course, impurity density fluctuations must be discarded too in order to reach 

this result, but-due to the huge inertia of impurities with respect to electrons-this does 

not appear a stringent bound.   

Because  of  the  reduced  statistics  in  comparison  with  Langmuir  probes,  only  the 

region around the maximum of the PDF can be accurately sampled. It is displayed in 

Fig.  2.  Even  in  this  case  we  are  plotting  the  full  signal,  not  its  deviation  from  the 

mean. 

Since the sampling frequency is just slightly above one hundred kHz, and is therefore 

partially  overlapping  the  range  of  frequencies  containing  appreciable  amounts  of 

turbulent signal, there is the question to what extent the resulting PDF is perturbed by 

this  effective  low-pass  filtering  procedure.  We  attempted  to  have  an  insight  by  the 

 

 

4

following  procedure:  we  filtered  the  Langmuir  signal  of  Fig.  1,  discarding  the 

frequency content above ffilters , and recomputed its PDF. The result is that is the high-

signal region to be mostly affected: the PDF goes to zero much more steeply than the 

unfiltered signal, and its slope is very well approximated by an exponential. The top 

of  the  curve  is  instead  not  dramatically  varying.  This  is  consistent  with  a  picture  in 

which the bulk of the signal is given by slow events, and only the tails of the PDF are 

determined  by  rapid  fluctuations.  These  consideration  can  be  only  qualitative,  but 

give us confidence that the PDF in Fig. 2 maintains some features of the true PDF. It 

clear,  however,  that  any  really  accurate  analysis  cannot  rely  on  the  data  in  Fig.  2: 

besides  the  already  mentioned  issues  about  statistics,  there  is  the  obvious  fact  that 

spectroscopy  measures  electron  density  fluctuations,  while  Langmuir  probes  do 

measure  ion  density  fluctuations.  Although  the  two  are  related,  any  attempt  of 

comparing results from the two diagnostics is not straightforward.    

III. Some considerations on the analytical form for Pn  

Let us dwell about the issue of the analytical form for Pn and the related issue of the 
differences in considering n rather than δn. 

No true investigations have appeared about the analytical functional form for Pn : to 
the best of our knowledge, the only approximation for it is that given by Antar et al8: 
a  gaussian  in  the  region  of  negative  δn  and  a  decaying  exponential  in  the  positive 
region: Pn(δn) = f(δn), with

It yields, indeed, a very good fit of the data (see Fig. 1), provided that x is identified 

with the absolute value of the density, x = n. It is easy to show, instead, that Eq. (1) 
cannot be consistent with experimental data if we choose the variable x equal to δn.  

We introduce, hence, a physically relevant distinction between density n and density 
fluctuation δn. This allows us to stress a point, rather trivial in itself, but that deserves 

to be mentioned: the visualization and investigation of fluctuating quantities in terms 

of  differences  from  their  mean  value  is  a  legacy  from  the  Central  Limit  Theorem 

(CLT),  which  states  that  the  PDF  for  any  (macroscopical)  Z  quantity  that  can  be 

 

 

5

written  as  a  sum  of  (microscopical)  z  stochastic  variables,  converges  to  a  gaussian, 

provided that the z variables be independent between them and at least their first two 

moments be finite. The departure from normality is usually seen as a signature of the 

existence of correlations in the microscopical dynamics that make the z variables not 

all independent between them. Within this picture, the mean value <z> is simply an 

offset of no physical relevance. We want to point out that, in the case of z = density, 

there is an obvious correlation, not stemming from any dynamics but  from the simple 

requirement for this quantity to be positive definite. This constraint does not play any 

role  as  long  as  one  limits  to  small  fluctuations  around  the  mean  value,  but  must 

radically modify the PDF at least for large negative deviations, which is exactly one 

of the regions we are investigating now.  For a similar caveat about the naïve use of 

CLT in turbulence, see Ref. [18]. 

Summarizing,  we  think  that-in  the  case  of  the  density-it  is  misleading  studying  the 
PDF in terms of just its fluctuations δn. Instead, also its absolute value is a physically 

relevant variable. Notice that this reasoning is dictated just by  an extremely  general 

principle. As such, they might apply as well to other positive-definite quantities, such 

as temperature. Indeed, an analysis of PDF P(T) is outside the scope of this work, but 

some partial investigations have been carried on, and confirm these statements. 
From  now  on,  hence,  we  will  not  refer  any  longer  to  δn,  but  only  to  n.  Keeping  in 

mind the above paragraphs, and guided by the visual inspection of the empirical PDF-

now  Pn(n),  we  are  led  to  argue  that  a  plausible  first  choice  for  Pn  is  the  log-normal 

function:

where F0, n0, σn are free parameters for fitting. 
In Fig. 1 we plot the best fit of data using Eq. (2). The χ2-test yields almost the same 

goodness  of  fit  either  using  Eq.  (2)  or  Eq.  (1).  The  agreement  with  the  data  is 

remarkable,  even  though  worsens  at  the  highest  values  of  n.  This  suggests  that, 

perhaps,  Eq.  (2)  is  a  first-order  approximation  of  an  even  more  refined  functional 

form. We shall discuss this point in the next section.  

IV. An interpretation for the log-normal form for Pn 

 

 

6

It is straightforward to notice that a log-normal PDF for a stochastic variable X is the 

same  as  a  gaussian  PDF  for  the  variable  ln(X).  It  is  therefore  natural  to  ask:  is  it 

possible  to  think  of  some  plasma  parameter  P  such  that  P  =  ln(n)  and  P  can  be 

regarded as a stochastic variable with gaussian PDF?  

A  very  rough  example  is  given  by  the  simple  zero-dimensional  picture  of  adiabatic 
electrons, where n is related to the plasma potential φ through

picture  (3)  is,  however,  too  simplified  when  compared  with  real  experimental 

scenarios  (apart  for  the  obvious  fact  that  it  deals  with  electron  density  and  not  ion 
density).  We  mention  just  a  few  references:  1)  in  RFX,  the  rms  of  φ/T  fluctuations, 
∆φ/T , stays almost constant when entering the plasma, while the same quantity for n, 
∆n , decreases20; 2) in RFX17 and Frascati Tokamak Upgrade21 (FTU), measurements 
of the cross-correlations (∆nt, ∆φt) yielded rather low values ( ∼ 0.5), not compatible 
with  (Eq.  3);  3)  finally,  in  a  review  devoted  to  this  subject,  Endler22  remarked  that 

several experiments were confirming that the relative phase angle of the fluctuations 
in φ and n lies between π/4 and π/2. This, too, is at a variance with (3).  

A more refined equation has been developed independently by several groups to relate 
particles and potential in the SOL. We refer here, e.g., to Krasheninnikov et al23,24 and 
Sarazin et al25,26. We report it in the form (Eq. 5 in ref. [24]):

total time derivative. We also write 2 b×k = - β ∇y , with β = 2 ρs/R and R the major 
radius:  β  measures  the  strength  of  the  curvature  drift.  The  axis  y  is  chosen 

perpendicular to the magnetic field: it is the poloidal direction in a tokamak and the 

toroidal  one  in  a  RFP.  Basically,  Eq.  (4)  is  the  charge  continuity  equation  for  a 

conducting  fluid  where  an  electric  field  arises  because  of  polarization  effects:  the 

driver, here, being the curvature. Numerical coefficients may slightly differ between 

approaches, depending on the degree of accuracy retained, as well as supplementary 

 

7

terms  may  enter  Eq.  (4)-for  example,  in  Refs.  [25,26]  the  viscosity  is  retained. 

However,  all  the  essential  physics  is  already  there.  The  lhs  is  nothing  but  the  time 

derivative of the net charge density, the first term in the rhs is simply the net current, 

and the latter term is the polarization drift. Eq. (4), hence, is a minimalist picture for 

the motion of a conducting fluid in presence of drifts.  It can be further simplified into 

a  form  suitable  to  our  purposes  under  the  further  simplifying  assumption  that  the 

temperature is almost constant.  

It is known from analytical as well as numerical calculations that, among the solutions 

of Eq. (4), are coherent stable structures (dubbed blobs by Krasheninnikov et al) that 

move rigidly with constant velocity on the top of background plasma. The lhs of Eq. 

(4) can be cancelled by shifting to the blob’s reference frame. Eq. (4) reads, thus,

This  yields  the  sought  functional  relationship  between  ln(n)  and  φ  which,  together 

with the usual ansatz of a normal PDF for φ, yields the log-normal expression for n. 

Expressions  (8)  or  (9)  provide  the  needed  decoupling  between  the  radial  profiles  of 

the rms of density and potential fluctuations. Infact, even retaining constant in space 
Ly    and  α/β  =  R/L,  there  still  remains  a  T-1/2  dependence  in  the  K  parameter.  In 

deriving  Eq.  (5)  we  supposed  T  spatially  constant;  however,  we  may  relax  this 

constraint  and  allow  it  to  be  only  very  weakly  varying  over  the  blob’s  typical  size. 

Since T increases while going towards the centre, it provides the decrease of density 

fluctuations  (notice  that,  in  this  case,  we  are  talking  about  fluctuations).  As  an 
example,  we  provide  in  Fig.  3  the  radial  profile  of    ∆n.  By  assuming  constant  ∆φ/T 
along the radius, as experimentally found20, Eq. (9) yields ∆n ∝ T -1/2. Notice that it is 
∆ln(n),  not  ∆n,  that  is  proportional  to  T-1/2;  but  for  small  density  fluctuations,  the 

difference is negligible. By assuming a profile

−
/(1(

))

, which 

is rather typical of RFX, we can try in Fig. 3 a best fit of ∆n data.  

In Fig. 1 we have provided both fits, using the full PDF (Eq. 8) and the log-normal 

PDF  arising  from  the  truncated  expression  (Eq.  9).  The  differences  appear  fairly 

limited,  although  a  small  improvement  appears  detectable  using  the  full  expression. 

The linearization of Eq. (5) seems therefore already to retain all the physics needed. 

However, this is not always the case. In Fig. 4 we plot the same kind of data as of Fig. 

1 but for two other RFX shots.  In both cases, and unlike Fig. 1, the probe is deeply 

inserted (about 10 mm). This makes questionable the correctness of Eq. (4), since we 

are leaving the SOL. Furthermore, in Fig. 4(a) we are featuring a pulse with Helium 

as  working  gas,  while  in  4(b)  it  is  standard  Hydrogen.  Hence,  by  comparing 

simultaneously  Figs.  1,  4(a),  4(b),  we  are  investigating  the  potential  effects  of  two 

 

9

parameters over the shape of Pn(n): the former parameter is the distance from the wall; 

the second, the working gas. Notice that the three discharges in Figs. 1, 4(a), 4(b) do 

feature also some other  differences in mean plasma parameters: the mean density is 

not  the  same  for  all  (mean  temperature,  instead,  does  vary  only  very  slightly). 

However, we do not think that this can make a large difference. A priori, this can be 

inferred from the fact that the shape of the PDF is universal, regardless of the device, 

and  that  different  devices  feature  widely  different  plasma  conditions.  The  choice  of 

the  working  gas  is,  instead,  not  so  trivial  since,  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  all 

published data refer to experiments done using hydrogen isotopes.        

Let us therefore switch back to Fig. 4(a). The empirical PDF is fitted using Eq. (8): 

the  lognormal  approssimation  (not  shown)  could  not  fit  the  data.  Using  Eq.  (8), 

instead,  allows  a  roughly  satisfactory  interpolation,  although  the  quality  of  the  fit  is 

not excellent. In particular, above approximately n = 4 (in the units used in the plot), 

the slopes of the empirical and analytical PDFs begin to severely diverge.  

By contrast in the Hydrogen discharge, with the same probe insertion, Fig. 4(b), both 

fits  are  plotted,  but  are  practically  undistinguishable  and  both  yield  good  results. 

Again, the theoretical and empirical curves begin to diverge for 

≥n

55.4 ÷

, but much 

less  severely.  We  cannot  point  to  a  definite  reason  for  this  discrepancy.  It  may  call 

eventually for a failure of the model which, however, we have shown is able to catch 

most of the physics running.  

Limiting  to  not  too  large  fluctuations  (n  <  4),  we  can  notice  that  a  close  agreement 

between  Figures  1  and  4(b)  was  to  be  expected-again  on  the  basis  of  their  assumed 

universal validity: since different experiment find the same results, and since different 

experiments  are  likely  to  perform  measurements  at  different  spatial  positions,  the 

exact value of the distance from the wall must play just a minor role, at least as long 

as we do not go stretching Eq. (5) beyond its range of validity.  

Putting aside the question of the validity of Eq. (5), what could be the cause  of the 

differences between Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) ? Basically, it must reside in the typical value 

of 

ln(

/
nn

/)

K

: it must be higher in the former case. Since n0 is just a normalization 

0

value for the density, the difference must stay in the coefficient K, defined in Eq. (8). 
The ratio α/β depends from geometrical factors alone, and the edge temperature is not 

dramatically  varying  between  Hydrogen  and  Helium  plasmas  in  RFX.  A  possible 

explanation is, therefore, related to a variation of the characteristic length Ly: it must 

 

10

be  lower  in  Helium  plasmas  than  Hydrogen  ones.  In  the  previous  discussion  we 

suggested  that  an  interpretation  for  Ly  may  be  attempted  in  terms  of  typical  size  of 

density  structures.  It  is  also  plausible  that  smaller  structures  give  a  reduced  net 

outward flux. Hence, this would correspond to an improved confinement, within this 

picture. Indeed, the matter is somewhat controversial: an inspection of RFX database 

tends to ascribe to Helium discharges better confinements properties than Hydrogen 
ones: the corresponding  points are located slightly  better on a Greenwald plot27. On 

the  other  hand,  no  clear  hint  of  reduced  transport  comes  from  direct  edge 
measurements28. Hence, another likely explanation is that some terms neglected in Eq. 

(5) start appearing at this stage, and their relevance be greater in Helium discharges. 

V. Conclusions 

We think to have outlined in this work a plausible explanation for the peculiar shape 

of  density  PDF  at  the  edge  of  magnetic  fusion  devices.  Quite  remarkably,  the 

explanation  starts  from  a  set  of  equation  written  for  the  Tokamak  SOL  physics. 

Although RFP’s and Tokamaks’ edges share many affinities, several differences also 

occur. Notwithstanding this, the final result is shown not only to describe equally well 

results for both devices under standard operating conditions, but also to give account 

for some scenarios (Helium RFP discharges) that, to our knowledge, never appeared 

in literature before.  

Within the picture here outlined, density plays essentially the role of a passive scalar 

advected  by  potential  fluctuations.  A  more  comprehensive  description  should  take 

into account also feedback effects of density on potential within a full set of coupled 

equations.  However,  the  fact  that  even  this  simplified  approach  is  able  to  match 

empirical data, leads us to think that these effects are small. Hence, the dynamics of 

the  plasma  edge  is  likely  to  be  governed  just  by  a  few  control  parameters:  plasma 

potential and, of course,  magnetic field among them. Any attempt of explaining the 

dynamics of these control parameters is outside the scope of this work.

We look for the properties of empty space-time proceeding from the general relativity princi-
ple. An infinite number of the so-called covariant ether theories (CETs) has been found, 
which, like the special relativity theory (SRT), satisfy all known experimental facts in the 
physics of empty space-time. In this connection a new approach to the problem of experimen-
tal testing of SRT is discussed. In particular, we show that covariant ether theories predict a 
dependence of Thomas-Wigner angle on an “absolute” velocity of a reference frame of obser-
vation. Hence, a measurement of this dependence is capable to distinguish SRT and CETs. It 
has been shown that the Lorentz ether theory is one of CETs, corresponding to the admissible 
Galilean transformations in physical space-time. Hence, we conclude that SRT and Lorentz 
ether theory can be distinguished experimentally, at least in principle. A crucial experiments, 
based on the Mössbauer effect, has been proposed. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Modern physics accepts two relativity principles: the special relativity principle (SRP) assert-
ing that fundamental physical equations do not change (they are form-invariant) under trans-
formations between inertial reference frames in an empty space, and the general relativity 
principle (GRP) stating that fundamental physical equations do not change their form (they 
are covariant) under transformations between any frames of references. Strictly speaking, the 
GRP requires a covariance of physical equations with respect to "admissible" space-time 
transformations, which keep the requirements  g00>0, gijdxidxj<0, where g is the metric tensor, 
and i, j=1...3.  
 Both relativity principles were introduced by Einstein at the beginning of 20
SRP lied on the basis of special relativity, while GRP in combination with the equivalence 
principle gave rise to general relativity theory.  
 The GRP is one of the deepest principles of physics and it means that any phenome-
non can be described from any reference frame, which can be realized in nature [1-3]. A prob-
lem of experimental test of GRP has no further meaning than a problem of experimental test-
ing of space-time homogeneity, causality principle, etc. The mentioned principles constitute 
the corner stones of modern knowledge, and we simply accept their validity: otherwise the 
whole of modern physics would be destroyed. 
 A fundamental physical consequence of SRP is an impossibility to reveal an absolute 
velocity of an inertial reference frame. There is a widespread opinion that SRP is a direct con-
sequence of GRP in the case of inertial motion in an empty space. If it were actually so there 
would be no meaning to testing SRP experimentally. Indeed, in such a case an experimental 
test of SRP would mean simultaneously a test of GRP, and such experiments seem to be im-
practical. However, the SRP in not, in general, a consequence of GRP; it represents an inde-
pendent physical assumption. Only in the case when empty space-time has a pseudo-

th century: 

Euclidean geometry with Minkowskian metric 1 in any inertial frame (which special relativity 
theory demands) can we derive a form-invariance of physical equations with respect to the 
Lorentz transforms as the special inference from the covariance principle. At the same time, 
from the viewpoint of formal logic we may introduce into consideration ether theories, where 
a metric in an arbitrary inertial frame depends on its velocity in the ether. If, nevertheless, the 
metric coefficients in such a co-ordinate geometry continue to be “admissible”, such a theory 
would be in agreement with GRP, but in contradiction with SRP. 
  The present paper has a goal to inspect more closely the relationship between SRP and 
GRP, as well as to analyze the experimental facts from this point of view. Section 2 derives 
some important consequences of GRP when applied to empty space. Section 3 investigates 
the properties of hypothetical empty space-time with metrics that differ from Minkowskian, 
and Section 4 describes the covariant ether theories (CETs), which are developed on the basis 
of GRP and symmetries of an empty space-time. Section 5 presents possible experiments for 
verification of CETs, based on the Mössbauer effect. Finally, Section 6 contains some conclu-
sions.  
 
2. About some consequences of GRP for the case of inertial motion in an empty space 
 
Let us write for an empty space a space-time transformation between two inertial reference 
frames in the general form 
x =
,  
a
where a,b=0...3, and x, x′ are four-vectors in the inertial frames. It is known that the principle 
of space-time homogeneity ensures linearity of this transformation [4]. The GRP requires that 
the transformations  A constitute a group of Lee with ten parameters: four initial space-time 
coordinates, three Eulerian angles, and three projections of a relative velocity [4]. Further, let 
us exclude the trivial space translations and rotations. In such a case the transformation de-
pends upon a single vectorial parameter - relative velocity  vr , i.e. 
x
 
 
a
The GRP also requires validity of the reciprocity principle [5]: the mutual velocities of two 
inertial reference frames should differ only by sign 
A-1( vr )=A( vr-
 
 
In its turn, the reciprocity principle ensures that det A=1 [5]. Thus, the transformations  A are 
special orthogonal.

In fact, this is all that we can say about the properties of the matrix  A proceeding from 
GRP and the principles of symmetry of empty space-time. In order to determine  A in closed 
form, it is necessary to define a model of an inertial reference frame and to make some addi-
tional physical assumptions. (For example, under Einstein's postulates, the matrix  A is equal 
to the Lorentz matrix L in Cartesian inertial reference frames). For these reasons nobody tried 
to pursue an analysis of the properties of empty space-time within GRP. However, as we will 
A be-
see below, poor information already obtained on the basis of GRP about the matrix 
comes nevertheless sufficient to determine a number of general laws of inertial motion. Such 
an analysis seems important for a better understanding of the experimental basis of SRT. In-
deed, often an experiment dealing with inertial motion in empty space is unambiguously con-
sidered as a test of SRP. However, if we show that the result of this or that experiment can be 
explained by the GRP solely, that it means a test of GRP, not SRP, then such an experiment 
becomes useless for physics.

In order to continue this consideration further, let us take a hypothetical assumption 
about existence of an “absolute space”, which has pseudo-Euclidean geometry with a Min-
kowskian metric. We designate a preferred frame, attached to the “absolute space”, as K 0. We 
look for a possibility to measure the absolute velocity  vr  within a moving frame K for space-
time transformation A in Eq. (2) with the properties defined above. 
 Consider two inertial frames K
The frame  K 1 contains some device D to measure the absolute velocity of that frame (by 
means of internal measuring procedures). Initially,  v=0, and hence, the above mentioned de-
vice D stays in some state corresponding to  v=0. Let us imagine that the frame  K 2 acquires 
some constant absolute velocity 
, see Fig. 1, a. Such an operation does not influence our 
device D in  K 1, and thus, it remains in the original state. According to Eqs. (2), (3) one can 
denote a transformation from K 1 to K 2 as  A-1( vr-

 Fig. 1: a – the frame 
b – the frame К2 rests in К0, and К1 moves at constant "absolute" velocity  vr+  in К0. 
 
 One can consider now a different case. Namely, the frame  K
2 remains at rest in the 
absolute frame  K0, while the frame  K 1 containing the device D acquires a constant velocity 
vr+  in the frame K 0 (see, Fig. 1, b). For such a case, a transformation from K 1 to K2 (and K0 
as well) takes on the same form  A( vr ), as for Fig. 1, a. On the other hand, it has been found 
that the A( vr ) has no effect on the state of the device D. Thus, according to the GRP, an abso-
lute velocity is not observable in this kind of experiments. One can easily see that such a kind 
of experiments corresponds to a case where all inertial parts of the device D rest in the (labo-
ratory) frame K1. 
 Thus, we get the 
empty space:  no absolute motion with a constant velocity could be detected by a device 
having all inertial parts resting with respect to one another. This theorem explains the null 
results of all interference experiments searching for “ether wind”, beginning with Michelson-
Morley. 
 Let us consider now a device having inertial parts moving at constant non-zero relative 
velocities one versus another in the frame K 1. Each part having a different constant velocity

to the fact, that a motion of the frame  K 2 has no effect on the D (belonging to K 1) one can 
conclude that this transformation leaves all parts of the device D in the original state, regard-
less of the value of the index  i, details of the transformation itself and particular construction 
of the device. In order to find the indication of D for the second motion diagram (K 2 at rest in 
vr+  in K0, Fig. 2, b), one can assume, in general, two

kinds of transformations from each  K i to  K 2 (and  K 0 as well):  A( vr )A(
).

These transformations, generally, are not equal to each other, since orthogonal transforma-
tions are not commutative (the group of space-time transformations is non-Abelian). We al-
ready proved above that the first  A( vr )A( iur ) transformation does not change the state of D. 
Simultaneously we conclude that the other transformation  A(
), being different from 
A( vr )A( iur ), changes the state of the measuring device D. Therefore, it is able to describe the 
difference of indications of D under “absolute rest” and “absolute motion” of the inertial ref-
erence frame K1. This again shows that the GRP and SRP (where such a situation is impossi-
ble) represent two independent physical assumptions: generally speaking, the GRP does not 
forbid the existence of absolute space.

 One can show that two general inferences of GRP obtained above, taken together, ex-
plain the null results of all experiments searching for “ether wind” velocity, performed up to 
date [6]. 
 We stress that the first and second inferences of GRP were obtained in quite general 
form, and they do not depend on a specific construction of the device D, as well as a specific 
choice of the transformation A.  
 
Independence of the obtained inferences from any specific structure of the device 
D has a principal importance. It means that a device D can be constructed on the basis of any 
known form of interaction, and it can be either macroscopic or microscopic. Hence, both in-
ferences obtained above belong not only to relativistic kinematics, but remain valid for any 
other area of physics. 

Independence of the obtained inferences   from a particular choice of the trans-
formation A in Eq. (2) seems to contradict the mainstream opinion that the Lorentz transfor-
mations  L exclusively describe phenomena with non-observable absolute velocity in an 
empty space-time. However, our consideration of general motion diagrams in Figs. 1 and 2 
indicates that such an opinion is erroneous. Further we will actually show that all available 
experimental facts in the physics of empty space can be explained under any admissible trans-
formation A. A concurrent problem is to understand the physical meaning of ether space-time 
theories with different transformations  A, as well as different successions of their actions for 
the motion diagram in Fig. 2, b. In order to solve these problems, it is necessary to analyze 
more closely the properties of empty space-time under an ether hypothesis. 
 
3. Pseudo-Euclidean empty space-time with oblique-angled metrics 
 
We will further analyze the ether theories, which adopt pseudo-Euclidean geometry with 
Minkowskian metrics for “absolute space”. Since the motion of an arbitrary inertial frame 
does not influence geometry of absolute space, it continues to be pseudo-Euclidean for any 
moving inertial observer. However, due to possible dependence of space and time intervals on 
the absolute velocity, admitted in the ether theories, the metric coefficients also depend on the 
absolute velocity, and the metric tensor  g in moving frames is no longer Minkowskian. This 
means for pseudo-Euclidean geometry that physical space-time four-vectors in an arbitrary 
inertial frame should be linear functions of Minkowskian four-vectors

where the coefficients  Bab do not depend on space-time coordinates of a moving inertial 
frame; they depend only on its absolute velocity  vr . (This statement follows from the space-
time homogeneity [6]). Such a kind of pseudo-Euclidean geometry has the so-called oblique-
angled metric. Here  Lx  obey the Lorentz transformation L: 
x
 
 
In analysis of space-time with an oblique-angled metric, there is an essential methodological 
feature that has to be taken into account. Although this feature was stressed many years ago 
by Reichenbach (e.g., [7]), present ether theories do not take it into account explicitly.

It may be natural to believe that in any inertial reference frame we are able to con-

struct a method for measurement of space and time intervals such that the result of measure-
ment directly gives the physical magnitude of the corresponding interval. But strictly speak-
ing, this is a property exclusive to pseudo-Euclidean geometry with Minkowskian metrics. 
Only in this kind of geometry can we omit a distinction between physical space-time four-
vectors and four-vectors, obtained via measurements [3, 6, 8, 9]. That is, in general, we have

the four-vectors in physical space-time (hereinafter “physical” four-vectors) are not equal to 
the four-vectors, whose components were obtained via a measurement of corresponding space 
and time intervals (hereinafter “measured” four-vectors). Hence, in any alternative to SRT 
theory we have to derive separately the transformation rules for both kinds of four-vectors,

kowskian metric of absolute space, the measured time intervals always obey the Lorentz

which means that a distinction of oblique-angled metrics in moving inertial frames from Min-
kowskian metrics is not experimentally observable. In another words, an observer in any iner-
tial frame moving in absolute space sees the world, almost as in SRT, for an infinite set of 
ether space-time theories with  Bi0=0. (However, this does not yet mean that SRT and all ether 
theories cannot be distinguished experimentally. This problem will be analyzed below).

their results. This conclusion is in full accordance with the implications of GRP obtained in 
Section 2 for the case of inertial motion in empty space-time.

which means a Minkowskian metric of physical space-time in any inertial reference frame. In

where one of the frames is absolute. In order to find a transformation between two arbitrary

where the matrix A can be taken in arbitrary admissible form. Thus in contrast to SRT, under 
the hypothesis A„ L, Nature does not “know” a direct relative velocity of two arbitrary inertial

frames K and K”: it is always composed as a sum 
sponding velocities of K and K” in the absolute frame K 0. This means, in particular, that di-
rect rotation-free Lorentz transformation between measured space-time four-vectors in K and 
K” is impossible: according to general group properties of these transformations, an additional 
rotation of the coordinate axes of the frames K and K” appears at the Thomas-Wigner angle

space-time coordinates,  i.e., it can be really detected. It defines a principal possibility to ex-
perimentally distinguish the hypotheses  A=L and  A„ L. We also notice that for collinear 
2vr , W =0, and the absolute velocity is not observable. This result corresponds to the sec-
and 
ond implication of GRP, obtained in section 2. Hence, in corresponding experiments, testing 
CETs, these velocities should be non-collinear.

Thus, we have got a full set of the Lorentz ether postulates in case  A=G.2 However, 

the physical space-time in the Lorentz ether theory is not observable in an arbitrary inertial 
reference frame, while the measured four-vectors  xex obey the Lorentz transformations in the 
form of (31). (This important circumstance concerning a difference of physical and measured 
four-vectors for oblique-angled metrics of space-time was dropped by Lorentz and his succes-
sors). Therefore, we may consider the Lorentz ether theory (LET) as one of the CETs defined 
above, and the simplest among them. Due to this fact, the application of the Lorentz ether pos-
tulates for the explanation of “null” results of all experiments searching for “ether wind 
speed” was always successful. At the same time, now we get a possibility to proceed not only 
from the Lorentz ether postulates, but from the complete kinematics of LET. Its full descrip-
tion is given by the following equations, obtained above:

velocity, it can be infinite. However, in case of LET such a restriction is established by the 
equality  (
, which simultaneously means that the Galilean transformations in 
x
LET are “admissible”, and they act within pseudo-Euclidean geometry.  
 The most important physical consequence of kinematics of LET, expressed by Eqs. 
(38)-(42), is a principal possibility to detect experimentally the absolute velocity  vr  of an iner-
tial reference frame, due to the mentioned above dependence of the Thomas-Wigner angle   W
on  vr . It can be seen in the problem of diametrical synchronization of distant clocks by a mov-
ing rod. 

 

Let two clocks Cl 1 and Cl 2 be placed upon the  x axis of some inertial reference frame 
K at rest in the absolute frame K 0. The distance between Cl 1 and Cl 2 is equal to  L. Let some 
rod with a proper length L moves along the y axis at a constant velocity  ur . The axis of the rod 
is parallel to the  x axis, and the coordinates of its opposite ends upon the  x axis coincide with 
the respective coordinates of Cl1 and Cl2. So at the instant when the rod is intersecting the axis 
x, it is simultaneously touching the Cl 1 and Cl2 in the frames K and K0. We assume that at the 
touch moment each clock emits a short light pulse towards to the time analyzer (TA) placed 
between the clocks. Thus, when K rests in K0, the indication of TA is 

0=

. 

t

Now consider the same problem when the frame K moves at the constant absolute ve-
locity  vr  along the x axis (see, Fig. 3). One requires to find in the laboratory frame K an indi-
cation 

 of TA.

We attach the frame K r with the moving rod. The velocity of K r with respect to K is 
equal to u along the  y axis, while the velocity of K with respect to K 0 is equal to  v along the 
axis  x. In order to calculate the value

Since the measured light velocity is isotropic, that Eq. (44) directly gives the indication of

4.1. Notes about classical dynamics and classical electrodynamics of CETs 
 
Now we make a further step to generalization of CETs, stating that physical and measured 
values should be inevitably distinguished not only for space-time four-vectors, but for any 
functions of  t,  rr . Then the quantities, depending on 
xex and constituting measured four-
vectors (energy-momentum, charge density-current density, etc.), obey the Lorentz transfor-
mations, while their corresponding physical magnitudes (depending on  xph) are subjected to 
the transformation  A. This result follows from the general transformation rule for a four-
vector X:

cerning these equations in an arbitrary frame of references, we mention that an absolute mo-

depending on the absolute velocity. We stress that such a coordinate transformation in CETs 
is an objective property of nature, on the contrary to purely mathematical coordinate trans-
formations in SRT. That is why CETs leads to alternative to SRT physics. At the same time, a 
mathematical identity of the admissible coordinate transformations in two these theories al-

velocity v is always less than  c. This again signifies that we work within admissible Galilean 
transformations, and do not leave pseudo-Euclidean geometry of empty space-time. Substitut-
ing the coefficients (50) into the Maxwell equations, written in arbitrary admissible coordi-
nates (see, e.g. [1, 3]), we can find their form in physical space-time of LET. Within the same 
coordinate formalism we can derive a law of transformation of physical electric and magnetic 
fields, using the metric tensor (50). This is a quite formal mathematical task. However, a 
physical analysis of classical electrodynamics in LET, written in physical space-time with the 
metric tensor (50), represents a very extensive problem. At the same time, it is important to 
remember that using measured space-time coordinates, we always get the corresponding 
“measuring” functions of space-time, and observable world looks almost the same, like in 
conventional relativistic dynamics and classical electrodynamics. The difference appears in 
successive space-time transformations with non-collinear relative velocities. This problem in 
its application to dynamics and electrodynamics will be analyzed elsewhere. However, with-
out such a detailed analysis, we already can notice that the conception about “physical” and 
“measured” quantities appears to be useful in resolution of a number of relativistic paradoxes 
of classical electrodynamics. One of them is presented in Fig.4. Let there be two charges 
point-like particles with the charge  + q and  – q, respectively, being inside a hollow neutral 
tube. The tube is placed into a parallel plate condenser, creating a homogeneous electric field 
E along the axis y. The tube has a single degree of freedom to move along the axis  y. A gravi-
tation field is absent, so that the masses of particles are not relevant. Initially both particles are 
fixed inside the tube and they rest with respect to each other and the condenser. The resultant 
force acting on the tube along the axis  y is composed as the sum of  qE and –qE, and equal to 
zero. Now we imagine that the positively charged particle (p) can move inside the tube, and it 
acquires a constant velocity  v in the negative  x-direction (Fig. 4). We want to compute the 
force acting on the tube along the axis y.

Fig. 4. The oppositely charged point-like particles “p” and “n” are placed into a hollow tube. All system is in the 
inner volume of the parallel plate condenser, which creates the electric field  E along the axis  y. The particle “n” 
is fixed inside the tube and rests with respect to condenser. The particle “p” moves at the constant velocity 
v 
along the axis -x. Here we assume a presence of an external mechanical force along the axis  x, which compen-
sates an electrical attraction of the particles. We also exclude a weak electric interaction between the condenser 
and the thin wall tube due to its electric polarization.  
 
 It seems that the problem is trivial: the magnetic field is absent in the rest frame of 
condenser (KC), and the total force acting on the moving particle “p” is directed along the axis 
y and equal to F+=qE, like in the case v=0. Since the force acting on the particle “n” is F-=-qE, 
that the resultant force, exerted on the tube due to two charged particles, is equal to zero. 

A paradox appears, when we compute the same force in the rest frame K p of particle 

“p” within SRT. According to the relativistic force transformation law [1]

5. Possible experimental tests of CETs 
 
As we concluded above, the difference between SRT ( A=L) and CETs (A„ L) appears at the 
experimental level only in successive space-time transformations with non-collinear relative 
velocities. Such is a property of space-time transformations in CETs (Eqs. (31), (32)), which 
corresponds to the general conclusions of Section 2. It follows from there, that an instrument 
for measuring an absolute velocity must contain moving inertial parts, in order to deal with 
such transformations. Then a general idea of an experiment for a choice between SRT and 
CETs can be described with the help of the diagram in Fig. 5. It shows the absolute frame K 0, 
vr ) and frame  K i, attached to 
laboratory frame K (moving at the constant absolute velocity 
some moving inertial part of a measuring instrument in K.

Fig. 5. General idea for an experiment to provide an experimental test of covariant ether theories. 
 
In our laboratory we specify a constant velocity  ur  of Ki in K. In such a case for the 
hypothesis A=L we apply a direct rotation-free Lorentz transformation K ﬁ Ki for calculation 
of the reading of the measuring device. Hence, according to SRT we get a vanishing value of 
absolute velocity. Under the hypothesis  A„ L, Nature does not “know” a direct rotation-free 
Lorentz transformation between K and Ki, and “operates” with the absolute velocities of these 
frames  vr  and 
. Hence, in order to calculate an indication of the measuring device, we 
must apply the successive Lorentz transformations K ﬁ K0ﬁ Ki according to Eq. (31). (A di-
rect Lorentz transformation from K to K i is also possible, but it will not be rotation-free). In 
this case the axes of the frames K and K i are turned out at the Thomas-Wigner angle  W
, that, 
in principle, changes the state of the measuring instrument. Since 
 depends on the absolute 
velocity  vr  of the laboratory frame K, the state of the measuring instrument will depend on  vr , 
too. There is only one particular case ( vr  is collinear to  ur ) where

measuring instrument has to be unchanged for any magnitude of absolute velocity of the labo-

tal instruments containing moving inertial parts, aiming to measure non-relativistic effects 
under collinear  vr  and  ur  (see, e.g., [10-12]), in fact checked the GRP, not the Einstein relativ-
ity principle. 

Thus, an experiment for testing of CETs must contain moving inertial parts with non-

collinear velocities  vr  and  ur , and be aimed to measure a dependence of the angle 
 on the 
absolute velocity of the laboratory frame. To the order of magnitude 
, and for orthogonal 
vectors of  vr  and  ur , this dependence is defined by Eq. (43). A direct measurement of this de-
pendence in a laboratory-scale experiment is impractical. Indeed, the absolute speed 
v could 
be taken as about 10 -3c (typical velocities of Galaxy objects). The maximum value of  u could 
be about 10 3 m/s. Hence, the angle  W
 takes on the value 3 · 10-9, i.e., well below any limit of 
practicability in a laboratory experiment.

effect should be  VW

such experiments requires to develop classical electromagnetic theory of CETs in detail,

5.1. Proposed experiments for test of CETs, based on the Mössbauer effect 

One should mention that the  M össbauer experiments for test of CETs, in their com-

parison with known experiment by Champeney et al. [10], should be more sensitive by 
times. In fact, only past decade gave an opportunity to realize such high-sensitive experi-
ments, when the technique for resonant synchrotron radiation and for resonant detection of 
gamma-quanta had been developed. Possible schemes of such experiments with the resonant 
synchrotron radiation have been described in ref. [13] (for  67Zn isotope) and in ref. [14] (for 
57Fe isotope). In this paper we propose another experiment, which uses a radioisotope M öss-
bauer spectroscopy with resonant detection of gamma-quanta of 119Sn. 

u/c 

Let us consider the following experimental scheme. Let there be two rotors with the 

equal radius r, lying on the same plane and separated by the distance  L. Under synchronic ro-
tation at the angular frequency w these rotors drive a rod with the length L, as shown in Fig. 6. 
The Mössbauer source S and receiver R are fixed on the opposite sides of the rod. In this ge-
ometry we measure a relative Doppler shift between emission and absorption lines, which, as 
we will see below, is a function of the “absolute” velocity of Earth  vr . In order to obtain this 
function in the explicit form, let us consider a diagram of velocities of source and receiver in

the absolute frame (Fig. 7). In this diagram the vector of tangential velocity rotates clockwise 
at the angular frequency  w for both  the source and receiver. For simplicity we can imagine 
these vectors as some “clock arrows”, and within LET, where the Galilean transformations are 
valid, the physical directions of both “ clock arrows” coincide at any fixed instant. (A similar 
diagram drawing according to SRT, gives a corresponding retardation for the right “clock ar-
row”). However, during a time of light propagation from the first clock to the second clock, 
the right “arrow” has time to turn out at some angle  D j, which causes a corresponding linear 
Doppler shift between emission and absorption lines. It is obvious that the time of propaga-
tion of gamma-quanta from S to R (and hence, the value of  D j) depends on the angle between 
the vector of “absolute” velocity  vr  and the line S-R. Therefore, the same dependence should 
be detected, while measuring the relative energy shift between the source’s and receiver’s 
resonant lines.

Eq. (61) describes the energy shift between emission and absorption lines. The second term in 
brackets of rhs of Eq. (61) has a meaning of “gravitational shift” of gamma-quanta frequency 
in the non-inertial reference frame attached to the source and receiver of M össbauer radiation. 
Indeed, in accordance with the equivalence principle, an oscillating gravitational field with 
the potential uwsinwt appears in this frame. And the measured energy shift of gamma-quanta 
depends on the potential difference between S and R, according to known result of general 
relativity theory. Such a shift is vanishing for  j=0, i.e., for the case when the acceleration is 
perpendicular to the line S-R. 

 The most interesting is the third term in brackets of Eq. (61), which is proportional to 
the “absolute” velocity v. One can see that for j=0 (i.e., when the momentary velocities of the 
source and receiver are collinear to  vr ), this term becomes to be equal to zero. Such a result 
directly reflects the fact that under addition of Lorentz boosts with the collinear velocities, the 
Lorentz operators commutate with each other and an absolute velocity is not observable in 
CETs. We also notice that this term is proportional to  с-3, i.e., its value is greatly less than in 
с-2. As we men-
Champeney et al. experiment, where the eventual term was proportional to 
tioned earlier, it leads to stronger requirements to the energy sensitivity of the considered ex-
periment in comparison with the Champeney et al. experiment. Let us estimate numerically 
jsin =1. We adopt  L=1 m, the rotation frequency  n =200 
the third order term in Eq. (61) for 
Hz (w» 1250 Hz); the rotor’s radius  r=10 сm (u=wr=125 m/s); v/c=10-3. Then the relative en-
=1,7· 10-15. In order to measure such an energy shift, we 
ergy shift is equal to (

combination of single line Mössbauer source S. Such detectors have been developed to reach 
a sufficient progress for  119Sn (23.9 keV) and other isotopes of  M össbauer spectroscopy. It 
consists of a thin scintillating organic film, where the absorbing medium (converter) is dis-
tributed, and a photomultiplier. The converter transforms a beam of gamma-quanta into con-
version electrons accompanying decay of resonantly exited nuclei. Due to the very low 
gamma-counting efficiency by the organic film and the high counting efficiency for low-
energy conversion electrons such a detector has a high selectivity value S=
counting efficiency for resonant gamma-quanta, while  h
resonant gamma-quanta). For RSD the value S> 50 [15]. Hence, one may expect a great in-
crease in sensitivity of RSD to the relative energy shift in comparison with ordinary detectors 
of gamma-quanta, applied in Champeney et al. experiment.

Moreover, on the contrary to the Champeney et al. experiment, an RSD allows us to 

realize a continuous registration of gamma-quanta as a function of a rotating angle  wt due to 
application of special system of light-guides between the resonant scintillator and photomulti-
plier (Fig. 8). Such an arrangement allows one to look for the harmonic oscillations in meas-
ured signal (sin wt in Eq. (61)) and thus, to exclude an influence of possible time drift of the 
detector parameters as well as possible material deformations in the rotating frame.

6. Conclusions 
 

1) Consideration of all hypothetical ether theories of empty space-time, admitting 

pseudo-Euclidean geometry with oblique-angled metrics in arbitrary inertial frame, should be 
based on distinguishing between physical and measured space-time four-vectors. General 
analysis of the properties of admissible space-time transformations shows that in any theory 
adopting the general relativity principle and symmetries of space-time, the measured space 
and time intervals always obey the Lorentz transformation, regardless of a concrete choice of 
physical space-time transformation. The latter circumstance makes it possible to explain all 
known experimental results in physics of empty space-time within an infinite number of ad-
missible space-time theories, called “covariant ether theories”. 

2) SRT is unique among admissible theories of empty space-time because it directly 

asserts the equality between measured and physical four-vectors under optimal measurements. 
Adoption of such an equality defines the possibility of direct rotation-free Lorentz transforma-

 

20 

w
tion between two arbitrary inertial frames. This is impossible in all other admissible space-
time theories, named as covariant ether theories. An absolute motion of inertial frame in 
CETs, in fact, induces its admissible coordinate transformation, depending on an absolute ve-
locity. We stress that such a coordinate transformation in CETs is an objective property of 
nature, on the contrary to purely mathematical coordinate transformations in SRT. That is 
why CETs lead to alternative to SRT physics. In particular, CETs predict a dependence of 
Thomas-Wigner angle W

 on an “absolute” velocity  vr , resulted from the transformation (31).  
3) It has been shown that the choice of Galilean transformation in physical space-time 

within covariant ether theories leads to the Lorentz ether theory. Then kinematics of LET is 
described by Eqs. (38)-(42). They indicate a principal possibility to measure an absolute ve-
locity experimentally. Therefore, we lose an ether formulation of special relativity principle in 
the sense adopted by Lorentz and Poincaré. In contrast, we arrive at the conclusion: if an exis-
tence of absolute frame is assumed, that an absolute velocity can be detected experimentally, 
at least in principle.  

4) The dependence 

 can be measured in the experiments, based on the recent 

)(vr

methodological achievements in the M össbauer spectroscopy. The proposed experiments test 
the Einstein relativity principle within the scope of validity of general relativity principle, that 
qualitatively differs these experiments from another, being performed up-to-date in physics of 
an empty space-time.

Abstract. We ﬁnd a second-order diﬀerential and a q-diﬀerence operator
whose full set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the space of polynomials of
degrees at most N can be written explicitly. The eigenvectors are the gen-
erating functions of the dual Hahn (for the diﬀerential operator) and dual
q-Hahn (for the q-diﬀerence operator) orthogonal polynomials. The diﬀeren-
tial and q-diﬀerence operators are expressed in terms of the generators of sl2
and Uq(sl2) algebras, respectively, represented in the space of polynomials.

The corresponding diﬀerential eigenvalue equation is equivalent to a
quasi-exactly solvable one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with explicit
solutions. Connection between the q-diﬀerence eigenvalue equation and the
Azbel-Hofstadter problem is indicated.

1 Introduction.

In the present paper we shall ﬁnd new explicit solutions to some second-order
diﬀerential and q-diﬀerence eigenvalue equations of the form:

′′

′

a(z)f

(z) + b(z)f

(z) + c(z)f (z) = λf (z)

and

α(z)f (qsz) + β(z)f (qs+1z) + γ(z)f (qs+2z) = λf (z)

respectively, where the functions a(z), b(z), c(z) are polynomials in z, while
α(z), β(z), γ(z), in z and z−1. We shall be looking for polynomial solutions
f (z). Note that using a transformation of the type ψ(y) = g(y)f (z(y)) we
can always reduce (1) to the Schr¨odinger form − d2
dy2 ψ(y)+V (y)ψ(y) = λψ(y).
Let us ﬁrst consider equation (1). It is known (see [1] for a recent review
of the subject) that the spectral problem for the operator D = a(z) d2
dz2 +
b(z) d
dz +c(z) in the space HN spanned by the vectors 1, z, z2, . . . , zN is closely
related to the representation theory of the algebra sl2. HN is a representation
space of this algebra, and the generators of sl2 have in this representation
the following form:

J + = z2 d
dz

− Nz;

J 0 = z

− N/2;

d
dz

J − =

d
dz

.

The necessary and suﬃcient condition [2] for the operator D to leave HN
invariant is that D be expressed in the form

D = c++J +J + + c+0J +J 0 + c+−J +J − + c0−J 0J −+
c−−J −J − + c+J + + c0J 0 + c−J − + d,

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where ci,j, ci, d are constant parameters. Henceforth, we shall assume that
(4) holds. According to the usual classiﬁcation, equation (1) is called in this
case quasi-exactly-solvable.

If the parameters c++ = c+0 = c+ = 0 then D is, obviously, lower diagonal
in the basis of monomials {zk}N
k=0, and hence, it preserves the ﬂag H0 ⊂ H1 ⊂
· · · ⊂ HN . The coeﬃcient a(z) in this case is a polynomial of no more than
the second degree, b(z), the ﬁrst degree, and c is independent of z. Hence,
the operator D preserves HN for any N. Corresponding equation (1) is then
called exactly-solvable. It is easy to verify that in this case, changing the

2

six remaining parameters c+−, c0−, c−−, c0, c−, d, we can obtain for any N
an arbitrary operator D with the just mentioned restriction on the degrees
of a(z), b(z), and c(z). The full classiﬁcation of the polynomial solutions
to (1) for such an operator D is available in the literature (e.g., [3]).
In
particular, all the classical orthogonal polynomials (Jacobi, Laguerre, and
Hermite) satisfy exactly solvable equations of the type (1). In the present
paper, however, we shall be interested in a diﬀerent type of solutions.

Take once again the general case (4) and let now c++ = c−− = 0. Then
it is seen from (3) and (4) that the operator D is represented in the basis of
monomials {zk}N
k=0 by a tridiagonal matrix. The equation (1) takes on the
N
k=0 zkpk, the right hand side of this expression is
following form (f (z) =
called the generating function of the sequence {pk}N

We see that the quantities pk satisfy the three-term recurrence relation

ckpk−1 + (ak − λ)pk + bkpk+1 = 0,

p−1 = 0.

(6)

And we can choose p0 = 1. Thus [e.g., 3], pk(λ) form a ﬁnite system of
orthogonal polynomials. (See [4,5,6,7] for studies related to this aspect of
quasi-exact solvability.)

In Section 2 we show that if {pk(λ)}N

k=0 are the dual Hahn hypergeometric
polynomials, then we have an explicit solution for (1). “Explicit solution”
means here that the N + 1 eigenvalues λ and corresponding eigenfunctions
f (z) in HN are known explicitly.

The above considerations are readily generalized for equation (2). Equa-
tion (2) is related to the Uq(sl2) algebra in a similar way as equation (1) is
related to sl2 [1,9] 1. In Section 3 we shall ﬁnd explicit solution to equations
of the type (2). The eigenfunctions f (z) will be the generating functions of
the dual q-Hahn basic hypergeometric polynomials.

1In addition to the results for diﬀerential and q-diﬀerence equations reviewed in
[1], it is also possible [8] to obtain similar results for diﬀerence equations of the form

i Ai(x)f (x + δi) = λf (x).

The dual Hahn (dual q-Hahn) polynomials are the most general system
in the Askey-scheme of the known hypergeometric (basic hypergeometric)
orthogonal polynomials [10] whose generating function provides an explicit
polynomial solution to the eigenvalue equation (1) (equation (2)).

Note, ﬁnally, that the zeros of polynomial solutions of equations (1) and
(2) are connected with the eigenvalues λ by a set of Bethe-ansatz type al-
gebraic equations [11,12,9]. In particular, in the case of (1) these equations
provide a simple way to calculate the asymptotic distance between zeros
(zk − zk−1) of a solution of (1) and the linear increase of this distance with k
[13].

2 Dual Hahn polynomials and a diﬀerential

equation

The dual Hahn polynomials are deﬁned by the formula (e.g.,[10])

pn(λ(x)) =

n

Xk=0

(−n)k(−x)k(x + γ + δ + 1)k
(γ + 1)k(−N)kk!

,

n = 0, 1, . . . , N,

(7)

where γ and δ are ﬁxed parameters and the “shifted” factorial is deﬁned as
(a)0 = 1, (a)k = a(a + 1) · · · (a + k − 1), k = 1, 2, . . .. The polynomials
(7) satisfy the recurrence relation (which we will formally consider for an
arbitrary integer n)

λ(x)pn = Anpn+1 − (An + Cn)pn + Cnpn−1,
An = (n − N)(n + γ + 1),
λ(x) = x(x + γ + δ + 1).

Cn = n(n − δ − N − 1),

(8)

The above three-term recurrence relation can be viewed as the eigen-
value equation for an inﬁnite tridiagonal matrix M, pn’s being components
of an eigenvector. For what follows, we would need to demand that the ﬁ-
nite dimensional space LN corresponding to the indices n = 0, 1, . . . , N be
invariant under the action of the matrix M. This would be the case if the
matrix elements M−1 0 = MN +1 N = 0. Since for our matrix M0 −1 = C0 = 0
and MN N +1 = AN = 0, the transposed matrix M T will have the desired
property of preserving LN . The polynomials associated with M T satisfy the
recurrence

λ(x)˜pn = Cn+1 ˜pn+1 − (An + Cn)˜pn + An−1 ˜pn−1;

(9)

and it is easy to show by induction that

˜pn =

A0A1 · · · An−1
C1C2 · · · Cn

pn =

pn.

Now multiply both sides of (9) by zn and perform summation over n from
n = 0 to N. We obtain

λf (z) = z(z − 1)2f
{(γ − N + 2)z2 − (γ − δ − 2N + 2)z − (δ + N)}f

(10)

n=0 zn ˜pn. To get the homogenious equation (10), it was
where f (z) =
necessary to put ˜p−1 = 0 and ˜pN +1 = 0 (we can do this because we are
looking for solutions in LN ).

P

k=0.

We can represent (10) in the form λf (z) = Df (z) as the eigenvalue
equation for a second-order diﬀerential operator D in the space HN spanned
by monomials {zk}N

Since M T in LN is just the matrix representation of the operator D in the
basis {zk}N
k=0 (cf. formula (5) in the introduction), the eigenvalues of D in
HN and M T in LN are the same. To ﬁnd them, ﬁrst replace the parameter
N in (7) and (8) by N + ǫ, ǫ 6= 0. Then (7) will be valid not only for
n = 0, 1, . . . , N, but also for n = N + 1. We ﬁnd the eigenvalues from the
equation:

0 = det(M T − λI) = det(M − λI) = lim
ǫ→0

A0A1 · · · AN pN +1(λ).

(11)

Here (only) one of the factors Ai goes to zero as ǫ → 0: AN = −ǫ(N + γ + 1).
Furthermore, only the addend with the index k = N + 1 in the expression

pN +1(λ(x)) =

N +1

Xk=0

(−N − 1)k(−x)k(x + γ + δ + 1)k
(γ + 1)k(−N − ǫ)kk!

is not bounded as ǫ → 0 (growing as 1/ǫ). Hence (11) is equivalent to
(−x)N +1(x + γ + δ + 1)N +1 = 0. From here, using the deﬁnition of λ in (8),
we obtain the eigenvalues:

λm = m(m + γ + δ + 1),

m = 0, 1, . . . , N.

(12)

The corresponding eigenvectors of D are

(13)

Thus we obtained in an explicit form the full set of solutions of equation

The operator D is expressed in the following form in terms of the gener-

(10) in HN .

3 Continuous dual q-Hahn (dual q-Hahn)
polynomials and a q-diﬀerence equation

3.1 q a root of unity

The continuous dual q-Hahn polynomials (which depend on parameters a, b,
and c) are deﬁned by the expression (e.g.,[10])

pn(x) =

n

Xk=0

(q−n; q)k(at; q)k(at−1; q)kqk
(ab; q)k(ac; q)k(q; q)k

,

2x = t + t−1, n = 0, 1, . . . ,

(18)
where (d; q)0 = 1 and (d; q)k = (1 − d)(1 − dq) · · · (1 − dqk−1), k = 1, 2, . . ..
(In fact the n’th continuous dual q-Hahn polynomial diﬀers from pn(x) by a
constant.) They satisfy the recurrence relation

2xpn = Anpn+1 + (a + a−1 − An − Cn)pn + Cnpn−1,
An = a−1(1 − abqn)(1 − acqn),

Cn = a(1 − qn)(1 − bcqn−1).

(19)

As in the previous section, introduce the matrix Mq associated with the
eigenvalue problem (19) and the space Lk corresponding to the indices n =
0, 1, . . . , k. Let us ﬁrst consider the case when q is an N’th primitive root
of unity2, that is q = e2πiS/N , where S and N are positive integers which do
not have a common divisor other than 1. Let us set furthermore ac = q.
Then, obviously, Mq preserves LN −1. (Moreover, the orthogonal complement
of LN −1 to the whole space where Mq acts is also invariant with respect to
Mq.)

Multiplying both sides of the recurrence relation (19) by zn and perform-

ing summation from n = 0 to N − 1, we obtain

2xf (z) = {(az)−1 + az}f (z)+
{−(a−1 + bq−1)z−1 + a + 2b + qa−1 − (a + b)qz}f (qz)+
b{(qz)−1 − q − 1 + q2z}f (q2z),

(20)

where f (z) =

N −1
n=0 znpn.

2Note that the basic hypergeometric polynomials for q a root of unity have a number

P

of interesting properties and applications [14].

7

Proceeding in a similar way as in Section 2, we obtain the following set

of solutions to (20) in the space spanned by {zk}N −1
k=0 :

2xm = aqm + a−1q−m,

(21)

N −1

n

fm(z) =

Xn=0

Xk=0

(q−n; q)k(a2qm; q)k(q−m; q)kqk
(ab; q)k((q; q)k)2

,

m = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1

(22)
The solution is especially simple for m = 0: 2x0 = a + a−1, f0(z) = 1 +
z + z2 + · · · + zN −1. In this case we also know explicitly the zeros of f0(z):
zi = qi, i = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. Note that the zeros of all N solutions fm(z) can
be found in the case when b = 0. Then it is a simple exercise to obtain, using
(20), the set of zeros z(m) = {z1, z2, . . . , zN −1} of fm(z):

z(m) = {qm+1, qm+2, . . . , qN −1, a−2q−m+1, a−2q−m+2, . . . , a−2},
m = 1, 2, 3, . . . , N − 2
z(0) = {q, q2, . . . , qN −1},

z(N − 1) = {a−2q2, a−2q3, . . . , a−2qN }

(23)

The diﬀerence operator Dq (deﬁned by the equation (20) written in the
form 2xf (z) = Dqf (z)) can be expressed in terms of the generators of the
Uq1/2(sl2) algebra represented in HN −1. In a certain representation in this
space the generators have the form (we use the notation from [9]):

N−1

D = q

A = q− N−1
4 T+,
B = z(q1/2 − q−1/2)−1(q
C = −z−1(q1/2 − q−1/2)−1(T− − T+),

2 T+),

(recall that q = e2πiS/N ) where the operators T+ and T− act on a vector

As is easy to verify,

Dq = A2{−b(1 + q−1)A2 + (q1/2 − q−1/2)(bq− N−1

3.1.1 Azbel-Hofstadter problem

It was recently shown [15] that part of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian in
the Azbel-Hofstadter problem (of an electron on a square lattice subject to
a perpendicular uniform magnetic ﬁeld) can be obtained as (N) solutions λ
of the following equation in HN −1:

i(z−1 + qz)f (qz) − i(z−1 + q−1z)f (q−1z) = λf (z),

(26)

where q = eiΦ/2. Φ = 4πS/N is the ﬂux of the magnetic ﬁeld per plaquette
of the lattice. (Henceforth, we assume that N is odd.) The spectrum has
particularly interesting properties when S, N → ∞ so that S/N → α, where
α is an irrational number (see, e.g., [16,17]). Representation of (26) in the
basis of monomials gives:
i(qn+1 − q−(n+1))˜pn+1 + i(qn − q−n)˜pn−1 = λ˜pn,

n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1, (27)

where the polynomials ˜pn(λ) are deﬁned by the formula f (z) =

N −1
n=0 zn ˜pn(λ).
On the other hand, setting in (19) a = iq1/2 (hence, c = −iq1/2), b = 0,

P
we reduce (19) to

(1 − qn+1)ˆpn+1 + (1 − qn)ˆpn−1 = 2xˆpn,
ˆpn = a−npn,

n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1,

(28)

If we denote the N × N matrices corresponding to eigenvalue equations
(27) and (28) by H and M, respectively, then the following expression holds:
H = (M − M ∗)/i.

(29)

In other words, H is the imaginary part of 2M. (Note that M and its adjoint
M ∗ do not commute.) The spectrum of M is given by (21) with a = iq1/2:
2xk = 2 sin 2πk

N , k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1.

Expression (29) provides a connection between the results of Section 3

and the Azbel-Hofstadter problem.

3.2 Arbitrary q

Equations (18) and (19) are valid for an arbitrary complex q (except for
certain ﬁxed values which one can treat on the basis of continuity consider-
ations). In this general case, in order to obtain a q-diﬀerence equation with

9

the largest number of free parameters, we shall use the approach of Section
2. Namely, consider the polynomials associated with the transposed matrix
q . Put ac = q1−N , then the space LN −1 will be invariant with respect
M T
to M T
q . (Note that unlike for qN = 1, in the general case the orthogonal
complement of LN −1 to the whole inﬁnite-dimensional space is not invariant
with respect to M T
q .) The polynomials associated with M T
q are connected
with the dual q-Hahn polynomials as follows (c.f. Section 2):

˜pn =

(ab; q)n(q−N +1; q)n
a2n(q; q)n(ba−1q−N +1; q)n

pn.

Proceeding as in Section 2, we obtain the following equation for the gener-
ating function f (z) =

N −1
n=0 zn ˜pn:

P

2xf (z) = {az−1 + a−1z}f (z)+
{−(a + bq−N )z−1 + a + b + bq−N + a−1q−N +1 − (a−1q−N +1 + b)z}f (qz)+
bq−N {z−1 − q − 1 + qz}f (q2z),

Its solutions in the space spanned by {zk}N −1

k=0 are

2xm = aqm + a−1q−m,

m = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1,

(30)

(31)

fm(z) =

N −1

Xn=0

zn

(ab; q)n(q−N +1; q)n
a2n(q; q)n(ba−1q−N +1; q)n

n

Xk=0

(q−n; q)k(a2qm; q)k(q−m; q)kqk
(ab; q)k(q−N +1; q)k(q; q)k

.

(32)
In particular, this solution is valid for q = e2πiS/N , but the expression (32) is
more cumbersome than (22).

Finally, consider another system leading to equations of the type (2): the
dual q-Hahn polynomials. (Other known basic hypergeometric polynomials
leading by the procedure of this section to equations of the type (2) can be
considered as particular cases of the continuous dual q-Hahn and dual q-Hahn
polynomials.) These polynomials are deﬁned by the recurrence relation (we
use N − 1 instead of N in the usual deﬁnition [10])

µ(y)pn = Anpn+1 + (1 + γδq − An − Cn)pn + Cnpn−1,
An = (1 − qn−N +1)(1 − γqn+1),
µ(y) = q−y + γδqy+1,

Cn = γq(1 − qn)(δ − qn−N ),
n = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1.

p−1 = 0,

(33)

10

Setting γ = abq−1, δ = ab−1, q−N +1 = ac, and multiplying the recurrence
relation (33) by a−1, we obtain (19) where 2x = t + t−1, t = aqy. Thus,
the ﬁrst N continuous dual q-Hahn polynomials at ac = q−N +1 and the dual
q-Hahn polynomials are the same (up to renaming the parameters).

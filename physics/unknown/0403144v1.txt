Abstract 

Immersive  informal  environments  (such  as  summer  camps,  residential  programs  at 
museums and science centers, etc.) can provide a venue for young people to explore their 
scientific  thinking  in  a  less  formalized  context  than  is  available  in  most  traditional 
classrooms.  While  class  instruction  is  beneficial  for  children  to  develop  formal  science 
skills  and  content  knowledge,  venues  that  offer  more  opportunities  for  experimentation 
and  exploration  can  promote  deeper  understandings.  In  this  article  I  explore  the 
background of science learning and venues where this learning can take place followed 
by  a  review  of  the  benefits  and  necessary  components  of  well  designed  immersive 
informal programs.

1. Introduction 
 
A  decade  ago,  Project  2061  of  the 
for 
American 
the 
Association 
Advancement  of  Science 
  strongly 
recommended  in  their  Benchmarks  for 
Science  Literacy  (AAAS,  1993)  that 
everyone  be  enabled, 
their 
education,  to  develop  a  scientific  world 
view,  learn  and  use  the  principles  of 
scientific  inquiry  and  understand  the 
scientific  enterprise.  Working  towards 
achieving  the  goals  presented  in  that 
document  has  proven  a  significant 
challenge  –  prompting  a  great  deal  of 
reform  in  the  way  we  picture  and 
conduct  science  instruction.  One  thing 
that  we  have  learnt  is  that  in  order  to 
into  scientifically 
turn  our  children 
today’s  modern 
literate  members  of 
communities  we  must  offer  a  complete 
package  of  educational  experiences  and 
opportunities in a range of settings. 
 
Science  learning  can  take  place  in  all 
manner of venues. Just the simple day to

causes  us  to  construct  new  connections 
prior 
in 
understandings 
to 
that 
understand more of the world around us 
(see e.g. Mestre & Cocking, 2000). This 
is 
its  most 
extreme,  where  no  program  has  been 
designed,  and  there  are  no  goals  and 
outcomes...  on  the  other  hand,  this 
learning 
is  a  completely  personal 
experience,  and  it  is  when  we  have  a 
personal interest that we are most likely 
to learn. Even so, how effective a young 
person’s  learning  is  “out  in  the  world” 
depends  strongly  on  how  secure  of  a 
scientific  foundation  we  have  built  for 
them.  
 
Immersive  informal  environments  are 
places  where  young  people  spend 
periods of time outside of the classroom 
immersed  in  scientific  experimentation, 
investigation  and  thought.  For  example 
many  schools  now  regularly  take  their 
students  on  residential  visits  where  they

learning  outside  of

museums  and  science  centers  offer

and 
school 
universities  offer  summer  programs  to 
high school students; and a collection of 
specialized 
summer 
programs of this type. 
 
These  types  of  programs,  where  well 
designed,  can  provide  experiences  in 
learning  that  are  not  accessible  in  the 
traditional  classroom  and  can  focus  on 
aspects of science education that may be 
ignored  or  undervalued  by  traditional 
curricula.  In 
they  can 
provide  a  means  of  better  balancing, 
rounding  and  completing  a  child’s 
science education. 
 
In  this  article  I  will  first  review  some 
aspects  of  science  learning,  and  discuss 
some  venues  where  this  learning  can 
take  place.  I  will  then  describe  how 
can 
immersive 
provide  a  broader  range  of  scientific 
experiences, followed by a discussion of 
how good immersive informal programs 
can be designed and structured.

2. Science Learning 

 
learning 
The  most  effective  science 
takes place when instruction is designed 
in an inquiry based manner (NRC, 1995; 
AAAS,  1993).  In  fact,  the  cover  of  the 
National  Science  Education  Standards 
stresses 
this 
educational  style  –  dotted  with  the  key 
words  “inquire  –  observe  –  learn  – 
reflect – communicate – explore – assess 
–  encourage  –  interact  –  understand”, 
without  doubt  valuable  targets  for  a 
complete  science  education.  Where  this

instruction  can  be  focused  on

compartmentalized 
three  areas: 
knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes.  The 
knowledge  component  is  what  many  of 
us  gain  from  our  time  in  school  or 
college. However, serious concern exists 
about  how  much  of  that  knowledge 
remains  accessible  and  useful  when 
taught  in  a  traditional  manner.  (How 
many  things  can  you  write  down  that 
you learnt in 10th grade chemistry?) 
 
The transfer of scientific knowledge is a 
very complex issue in science education. 
The evolution of scientific ideas strongly 
suggests  that  the  ability  to  go  through 
life  absorbing  and  understanding  new 
scientific  information  is  just  (if  not 
more) as important as learning particular 
facts.  If  we  take  DNA  for  example,  we 
would expect every child to come out of 
school  knowing  what  DNA  is,  and 
maybe  some  other  basic  information 
about  its  structure,  its  presence  in  cells, 
etc... Yet only fifty years ago this would 
not  have  appeared  on  any  science 
curriculum,  as  its  nature  had  only  just 
been  discovered.  We  would  hope 
though,  that  scientifically  literate  adults 
educated  before  then  could  nonetheless 
appreciate  and  gain  some  understanding 
of that advance. 
 
How  scientists  understand  a  particular 
topic  can  also  often  be  very  different  to 
how  students  come  to  understand  it. 
Knowledge is not easily transferred, and 
each  individual  must  be  motivated  to 
come to an understanding of a particular 
subject in their own mind, making use of 
the  knowledge  with  which  they  are 
provided  (Mestre  &  Cocking,  2002).

There  is  a  strong  distinction  between 
knowledge,  which  a  student  can  be 
taught,  and  understanding  which  they 
must discover independently (though not 
necessarily without guidance). 
 
It  is  now  well  appreciated  that  the 
scientific  foundations  that  an  individual 
needs  do  not  just  comprise  a  set  of 
factual  knowledge 
retained 
throughout  our  lives.  Many  educators 
believe  that  the  skills  and  attitudes 
towards science are equally, if not more, 
important.  Content,  or  the  knowledge 
part  of  science,  only  comprises  about  a 
sixth  of  the  National  Science  Education 
Standards  (NRC,  1995).  Other  areas, 
such  as  skills  and  attitudes,  the  way 
science  is  taught  and  understanding  is 
assessed,  and how science programs  are 
designed  and  developed,  receive  equal 
the  standards  and  are

if  not  more,

literacy. 
 
I  choose  to  group  scientific  skills  into 
two broad sets: the formal skills that are 
expected  of  a  traditional  scientist  (e.g. 
using  a  microscope,  performing  of  a 
titration,  or  even  plotting  a  graph);  and 
informal skills which are more important

generally  not  taught,  but  young  people 
are expected to pick  them up  from their 
experiences. Ensuring that children have 
range  of 
access 
experiences  to  develop  these  skills  is  a 
vital objective.

interested,  in  this  discussion,  in  the 
“attitude  towards  science”  –  which  can 
be interpreted in many ways – but rather 
towards mental attitudes geared towards 
conducting  good  science.  At  the  basic 
level:  Are  you  interested  in  things  and 
how  they  interact?  This  is  of  course  at 
the  core  of  what  it  means  to  have  an 
inquiring  mind,  and  we  must  make  sure 
that  we  concentrate  on  encouraging  this 
kind of attitude. 
 
Inquiry is, by its very nature, a personal 
process, unique to each individual. If we 
value inquiry then we need to encourage

students 
described above, supported by a basis of 
knowledge  and  skills.  This  type  of 
attitude,  along  with  many  of 
the 
commensurate  skills,  is  most  effectively 
in  practical  environments, 
developed 
with 
the 
lively  discourse  between 
participants  and  instructors  (Reardon, 
2002).  Note  that  practical  environments 
are not the best place to gain new factual 
knowledge;  but  to  do  anything  with  the 
knowledge  requires  some  mental  or 
physical activity.

Such experiences in science, resembling 
a  free  association  between  a  child  and 
what  they  are  experimenting  with,  are 
unfortunately  often  seen  as  unstructured 
activities  that  have  little  measurable 
value.  However, 
to 
experience  science  can  provide  very 
strong support for knowledge and formal 
skills  by  increasing  their  relevance,  and 
can  provide  opportunities 
an 
inquisitive  attitude  to  develop  (Layman, 
1996,  chap.  1),  more  than  with  much

can be exhibited by children conducting

3. Venues for learning 
 
The  venue  where  we  learn  falls  on  a 
spectrum 
the  most 
informal  (out  in  the  world)  –  where  we 
rely  almost  entirely  on  our  previous 
experiences  to  construct  new  scientific 
understanding – to, traditionally at least, 
the most formal in schools and colleges. 
In between lie other experiences, such as 
visits  to  museums  and  science  centers, 
summer  camps,  and  workshops  or  short 
these 
courses.  The 
experiences  depends  on  the  particular 
programs that are offered.

Schools 
educational  environments  which  can  be 
very well suited to the development of a 
core  base  of  science  knowledge  and  to 
the  acquisition  of  formal  practical  skills 
(see  previous  section).  Clear  goals  are 
laid out by individual instructors, school 
districts,  and  at  the  state  and  federal 
levels;  little  room  exists  for  individuals 
to pursue their questions and interests.

that 
may  well  develop 
science is centered on factual knowledge 
and  formal  skills.  Most  professional 
scientists  would  identify  themselves  as 
being  more  inventive  and  relying  more 
on  their  inquisitiveness  and  informal 
skills  while  pushing  (or  even  while 
trying  to  understand)  the  frontiers  of 
knowledge.

directed  by  each  individual;  many  may 
pass  through  a  particular  exhibit  and 
appreciate  very  little  of  the  science, 
while  others  make  a  concerted  effort  to 
understand  and  may  learn  a  lot  (Falk, 
2001).  Informal  science  education  can 
and  should  complement 
the  science 
learning  that  takes  place  in  schools 
(Bybee,  2001).  In  this  way  students  can 
gain  the  most  from  both  experiences, 
providing  the  programs  are  designed 
with  this  complementary  scenario  in 
mind. This, of course, sets up a positive 
feedback  cycle  –  back  in  the  classroom 
these  students  will  be  more  receptive  to 
new knowledge and skills and more able 
to  continue  to  construct  understandings 
from them. 
 
 

4. Immersive informal programs 

 
I  have  discussed  up  to  this  point  the 
value  of  learning  science  in  a  practical, 
inquiry  driven  manner,  and  the  merit  of 
experiencing

multiple  venues.  While  science  centers 
and  museums  provide  outstanding 
opportunities  to  see  a  broad  range  of 
science in a greater context there is often 
little  space  for  an  individual  to  truly 
experiment  and  to  follow  their  own

immersive  environment  can  make  it 
possible  for  children  to  develop  their 
exploration skills and scientific attitudes 
in  a  much  more  individualized,  open-
ended,  manner  and  achieve  a  deeper 
scientific literacy. 
 
There is a distinction between immersive 
formal 
environments 
informal 
outside of school. A formal environment 
maintains  knowledge  and  formal  skills 
as its primary goal and may either act as 
a  booster  for  classroom  instruction  (e.g. 
a  week  long  SAT  II  preparation  course 
on a college campus) or as an accelerator 
(e.g. 
programs, 
“quantum  mechanics  for  high  school 
students”,  etc...).  Informal  immersive 
environments  allow  for  much  more 
individual  exploration,  and  complement 
formal  education,  rather  than  aiming  to 
provide direct support. 
 
What then are the components of a well 
informal 
immersive 
designed 
environment?    Key  aspects  are  attitude, 
immersion  and  program  design.  The 
attitude  of  the  program  towards  science 
the  distinction  above 
should  reflect 
between  formal  and  informal  programs, 
and  aim  to  produce  students  who  are 
more  inquisitive  about  science,  and  are 
inquisitive in a more effective manner. 
 
Immersion  is  important  –  the  program 
should  last  for  a  substantial  time,  this 
can either be continuous (e.g. a week or 
more  at  a  residential  center)  or  spread 
over time (e.g. a semester long program 
meeting once a week at a museum). This 
allows  students  and  instructors  to  get  to 
know  each  other,  and  more  importantly 
the

can  also  take  a  long  time  as  students 
become  comfortable  with  materials  and 
equipment,  and  discover  what  it  is  that 
they are interested in finding out. 
 
A well designed environment must have 
a  well  designed  underlying  program.  In 
terms  of  the  practical  science  areas 
discussed  earlier,  there  should  be  time 
for 
and 
investigation  –  though  none  of  these 
need  necessarily  be  formalized  to  the 
extent that they are in the classroom. The 
program  design  should  include  basic 
concepts  and  ideas  that  the  instructor 
hopes  their  students  will  gain  a  better 
sufficient 
understanding 
resources 
to 
experience,  experiment  and  investigate. 
A well designed program does not mean 
that a rigorous schedule or curriculum is 
required. 
 
Without  “pure  experimentation”  it  is 
very  hard  for  students  to  discover  the 
questions  that  they  are  interested  in. 
Even  though  this  may  look  like  play  to 
the  outsider,  raw  experience  is  a  vital 
component in developing an interest in a 
particular  phenomenon  or  developing  a 
plan 
to  use  a  particular  piece  of 
equipment (Woolnough & Allsop, 1985; 
Polman, 2000). The instructor may elect 
to  use  some  exercise  type  instruction  to 
directly  teach  some  content  or  a  formal 
skill, but this should only be used where 
the  growth  of 
essential 
understanding  –  exercises  should  not 
(and  probably  can  not)  drive  a  child’s 
curiosity.  Once  young  people  have 
developed  an  interest  they  should  be 
allowed time to investigate the questions 
that they generate. With support of their 
instructor  the  informal  skill  of  turning 
knowledge  into  understanding  can  be 
developed.

We can not (and should not) aim to turn 
every  child  into  a  professional  scientist. 
Rather,  we  would  like  every  individual

programs of the kind described here. 
 

5. Conclusions 

 
The best understanding of science occurs 
when  young  people  have 
inquiring 
minds  that  are  able  to  convert  new 
knowledge  into  genuine  understanding 
using  a  variety  of  formal  and  informal 
skills.  Science  instruction  ranges  on  a

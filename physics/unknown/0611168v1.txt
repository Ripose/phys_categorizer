Abstract.  The  HANARO  ex-core  neutron  irradiation  facility  was  developed  for  various 
applications  in  the  boron  neutron  capture  therapy  (BNCT)  field,  and  its  characteristics 
have been investigated. In order to obtain a sufficient thermal neutron flux with a low level 
contamination  of  fast  neutrons  and  gamma-rays,  a  radiation  filtering  method  is  adopted. 
The  radiation  filter  has  been  designed  by  using  a  silicon  single  crystal  cooled  by  liquid 
nitrogen and a bismuth crystal. The installation of the main components of the irradiation 
facility  and  the  irradiation room  are  finished.  Experimental  measurements  of  the  neutron 
beam characteristics have been performed by using bare and cadmium covered gold foils 
and  wires.  The  in-phantom  neutron  flux  distribution  was  measured  for  a  flux  mapping 
inside 
the  phantom.  The  gamma-ray  dose  was  determined  by  using  TLD-700 
thermoluminescence  dosimeters.  The  thermal  and  fast  neutron fluxes  and  the  gamma-ray 
dose were calculated by using the MCNP code, and they were compared with experimental 
data.  The  thermal  neutron  flux  and  Cd  ratio  which  can  be  obtained  at  this  facility  are 
1.49×109 n/cm2s and 152, respectively. The maximum neutron flux inside the phantom was 
measured to be 2.79×109 n/cm2s at a depth of 3 mm in the phantom. The two-dimensional 
in-phantom  neutron  flux  distribution  was  determined,  and  the  significant  neutron 
irradiation  was  observed  within  20  mm  from  the  phantom  surface.  The  gamma-ray  dose 
rate  for  the  free  beam  condition  is  expected  to  be  about  80  cGy/hr.  These  experimental 
results are reasonably well supported by the calculated values of the facility design code. 
This HANARO thermal neutron facility can be used not only for a clinical trial but also for 
various basic irradiation researches of the BNCT field.   

 
 
1. Introduction 

 

Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising method for a cancer treatment in principle, 
which  kills  the  cancer  cells  selectively  by  the  use  of  a  cancer  seeking  boron  compound  and  a 
neutron irradiation (Slatkin 1991). This therapy is expected to be very effective for several types of 
cancers such as a malignant brain tumor-glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), for which no successful 
treatment  has  been  developed.  Now,  worldwide  research  by  using  a  research  reactor  and  an 
accelerator is on going (Sauerwein et al 2002, Zamenhof et al 2004).   

A cancer treatment by using BNCT is based on a reaction of the B-10 nucleus in a cancer cell 
with  the  neutron.  Since  the  cross-section  for  the  B10(n,α)Li7  reaction  almost  decreases  to  E-1/2, 
where E is the neutron energy, the discriminated dose between the normal and the cancer cells is 
mainly  caused  by  the  thermal  neutron. However,  the  thermal  neutron  cannot  penetrate  deep  into 
the  tissue  while  the  GBM  has  usually  invaded  deep  into  the  normal  brain  tissue.  Therefore,  a

            2 

neutron  beam  with  a  higher  energy  can  be  more  effective  than  a  direct  irradiation  of  thermal 
neutrons. Moreover, an irradiation of these neutrons causes a thermal neutron peak at a depth of 
several cm. Since the biological damage of a neutron for a normal tissue is almost constant up to 
10  keV,  but  rises  rapidly  above  this  level  due  to  the  dose  from  a  proton  recoil,  the  use  of 
epithermal  neutrons  with  an  energy  of  a  few  keV  is  supposed  to  be  the  most  effective  for  the 
BNCT of deep-seated tumours (Bisceglie et al 2000). Therefore, a whole brain irradiation by using 
epithermal neutrons without a debulking has been  studied. On the other hand, a local irradiation 
with thermal neutrons after a debulking has been maintained with several methods to overcome the 
poor  penetrability  of  thermal  neutrons  including  a  mixed  irradiation  of  thermal  and  epithermal 
neutron beams (Sakurai et al 2000, Yamamoto et al 2002). 

In  HANARO,  a  30  MW  multipurpose  research  reactor,  due  to  its  design  characteristics,  a 
sufficient amount of epithermal neutrons for the BNCT cannot be obtained, but a sufficient amount 
of thermal neutrons can be obtained by means of a fast neutron and gamma-ray filtering method. 
We have designed an ex-core thermal neutron irradiation facility for various applications including 
BNCT. Over the past few years, the installation of the irradiation facility has been completed, and 
the irradiation room has been constructed.   

The basic facilities required in a research reactor for a BNCT are a neutron irradiation facility 
for  a  treatment  and  a  device  for  an  instant  measurement  of  the  boron  concentration  in  patients' 
blood samples. For HANARO, the ex-core thermal neutron irradiation facility is ready for a BNCT 
irradiation. And also, the facility for measuring the boron concentration by using a prompt gamma 
activation  analysis  with  a  good  sensitivity  has  been  developed  (Byun  et  al  2002).  This  thermal 
neutron field can be used not only for a BNCT but also for the several neutron applications such as 
dynamic  neutron  radiography.  For  the  BNCT  applications,  this  facility  can  be  used  for  a  local 
irradiation and for various researches before clinical trials such as a small animal irradiation. 

In  this  study,  the  design  characteristics  of  the  ex-core  neutron  irradiation  facility  of 
HANARO are described, and the major factors of the facility for BNCT applications such as the 
neutron flux and gamma-ray dose rate are determined. 

 
 

 

2. Development of neutron irradiation facility 

2.1. Design considerations 
HANARO  has  seven  horizontal  beam  tubes  for  neutron  beam  applications.  The  ex-core  neutron 
irradiation facility for a BNCT has been installed by using a typical tangential beam tube whose 
nose  is  located  in  the  thermal  neutron  peak  area  of  the  heavy  water  reflector  tank.  Because  the 
beam  tubes  are  narrow  in  width  and  long  at  over  400  cm,  a  sufficient  amount  of  epithermal 
neutrons for a BNCT cannot be obtained. In order to obtain a sufficient thermal neutron field with 
a low level contamination of fast neutrons and gamma-rays, a radiation filtering method by using a 
single crystal, cooled by liquid nitrogen, has been adopted. 

In HANARO, various experiments are undertaken simultaneously, and its high power density 
prevents a restart within about two days after a shutdown due to the xenon buildup. Therefore, an 
effective method to operate the irradiation facility without interference to the reactor operation has 
been developed.   

In order to apply a local irradiation method after a debulking, temporary surgical operations 
before  and  after  an  irradiation  for  a  patient  should  be  possible  at  the  irradiation  site  while  the 
reactor is under a full power operation. Since there was no available space to perform an operation 
inside  the  HANARO  reactor  hall,  an  irradiation  room  has  been  designed  so  that  a  surgical 

Development and characteristics of the HANARO ex-core neutron irradiation facility 

            3 

operation might be possible in it. The irradiation room should be spacious enough for an operation, 
and the medical requirements must be met. Also, the radiation level outside the irradiation room 
should be maintained below the allowable level during an irradiation. 

2.2. Water shutter 
In order to perform the various research activities of HANARO without any interference caused by 
an operation of the BNCT facility, a water shutter has been designed and installed. The shutter was 
made of aluminium. Its inner diameter is 236 mm, and its axial length is 1350 mm. The volume of 
the inner part of the shutter is 60 liters. The water in the shutter is drained into the outer reservoir 
by compressed air, which is supplied by the electric pump. The time required for the water going 
into and out of the shutter is about 2-3 minutes. When the shutter is closed, the radiation dose rate 
inside the irradiation room is much lower than the allowable level even if the reactor is operated at 
a full power. 

 

 

2.3. Radiation filter 
2.3.1. Filter design. The purpose of the radiation filter is for a maximum extraction of the thermal 
neutron  from  the  reactor  with  as  small  contamination  of  the  fast  neutrons  and  gamma-rays  as 
possible.  Even  though  fast  neutrons  and  gamma-rays  are  also  used  for  a  cancer  therapy,  they 
cannot  kill  the  cancer  cell  selectively  like  the  BNCT,  and  thus,  the  fast  neutron  and  gamma-ray 
extractions should be minimized. 

Material  used  for  this neutron  filter  should  have  a very  small  thermal  neutron  cross-section 
while  its  fast  neutron  cross-section  is  rather  high.  Table  1  shows  several  materials  whose  cross-
sections  for  the  fast  neutrons  are  larger  than  those  for  the  thermal  neutrons  (Nuclear  Energy 
Agency  1994).  From  the  table,  it  is  confirmed  that  helium  is  the  most  advantageous  from  the 
aspect  of  a  cross-section.  However,  helium  is  not  proper  for  this  application  because  it  must  be 
used in a gaseous phase. Aluminium was proposed as the next choice for the filter material, and 
thus we simulated the neutron transmission through the aluminium for the neutron beam extracted 
from a beam port of HANARO by using the MCNP code. However, the improvement of the flux 
ratio of the thermal neutron to the fast neutron was rather small.

The thermal neutron cross-section of a material with the crystal structure where the atoms are 
regularly arranged becomes smaller than that in the powder, while the change of the cross-section 
for  the  fast  neutron  is  negligible.  In  addition,  the  penetration  ability  of  thermal  neutrons  is 
enhanced  when  the  single  crystal  is  cooled  to  the  temperature  of  liquid  nitrogen  (LN2).  In  the 
above materials, the silicon single crystal is the only one that can be grown to a size large enough 
to  be  applicable  to  the  filter.  Therefore,  a  silicon  single  crystal  cooled  by  liquid  nitrogen  was 

Development and characteristics of the HANARO ex-core neutron irradiation facility 

            4 

chosen as the neutron filter. The bismuth crystal was used after the silicon crystal as the gamma-
ray filter. The bismuth crystal has a small neutron cross-section and a small secondary gamma-ray 
production  rate.  Figure  1  shows  the  neutron  cross-sections  of  the  silicon  and  the  bismuth  in  the 
cases of room and liquid nitrogen temperatures. These cross-sections are deduced semi-empirically 
including  the  absorption  and  thermal  diffusion  scattering  (Freund  1983).  From  the  figure,  it  is 
confirmed that the shape of the cross-section of the silicon crystal is proper for the objective of this 
filter. The cross-sections of the bismuth shift to a lower energy than those of the silicon, and the 
rate of change is bigger than that of the silicon.

and liquid nitrogen temperatures. 

 
After the sensitivity studies, the filter details were determined as a silicon single crystal of 40 
cm in length and 20 cm in diameter and a bismuth single crystal of 15 cm in length and 10 cm in 
diameter. The silicon and bismuth crystals were fabricated so that the concentration of the dopants 
or  impurities  inside  them  was  as  low  as  possible.  In  order  to  cool  down  the  crystals,  a  liquid 
nitrogen  supply  system  and  a  vacuum  system  were  installed.  The  vacuum  gap  for  the  thermal 
insulation was maintained below 1×10-4 torr. The radiation filter was positioned at the exit part of 
the  beam  tube  to  minimize  the  neutron  loss  due  to  the  direction  change  after  scattering.  The 
shielding surrounding the filter was composed of polyethylene, lead, plastics containing boron, and 
polycrystalline  bismuth.  Figure  2  shows  the  schematic  layout  of  the  radiation  filter  of  the 
HANARO ex-core irradiation facility for the BNCT applications. 
 
2.3.2. Calculations for the beam parameters. The thermal and fast neutron fluxes and the gamma-
ray dose were calculated by using the MCNP code. The calculation model for the whole facility 
including the reactor core, the reflector tank, the beam tube and the radiation filter is too big and 
complicated  to  be  dealt  with  by  the  MCNP.  In  order  to  obtain  a  reliable  result  with  a  small 
statistical deviation, the calculation was divided into two steps. At first, the neutron source at the 
nose of the beam tube and its angular distribution were determined by using a model of the reactor 
core  and  the  reflector  region.  And  then,  the  beam  parameters  were  calculated  through  the  beam 
tube by using a determined source at the nose. In the calculation for a long beam tube, a geometry

            5 

splitting  with  Russian  roulette  was  used  to  deliver  more  particles  towards  the  beam  exit  for  a 
variance reduction. The importance of each cell nearer to the beam exit was increased. 

The cross-sections of the silicon and bismuth crystals including the case of a cooling to the 
liquid nitrogen temperature are not provided in the MCNP code. Therefore, we added their cross-
section  data,  which  were  obtained  by  using  a  semi-empirical  formula,  to  the  MCNP  library 
(Freund 1983).

2.4. Front shielding, collimator and beam monitoring system 
Since  the  radiation  level  inside  the  room  should  be  low  enough  for  the  workers  to  access  the 
irradiation room when the water shutter is closed, we installed the shielding structure in front of 
the  radiation  filter.  Inside  this  shielding  structure,  the  beam  collimator  and  the  detectors  for 
monitoring the neutron beam and the gamma-rays were installed. When the water shutter is closed, 
the spatial radiation dose rate inside the irradiation room is lower than 5 μSv/hr. 

The  cone  shaped  collimators  were  manufactured  by  sintering  a  mixture  of  6Li2CO3  powder 
(95 % enriched in Li-6) and high density polyethylene powder (Riley 2004). So far, we have made 
two collimators with beam hole diameters of 97 mm and 146.7 mm. The thickness of the sintered 
collimator is 15 mm or more. The diameter of the collimator used in the present experiments was 
146.7 mm.

            6 

A fission chamber and an ion chamber were installed to monitor the changes of the neutron 
and gamma-ray extractions due to an unexpected reactor power variation or malfunctioning of the 
components  of  the  facility  such  as  the  water  shutter.  The  sizes  of  the  detectors  are  20.3  cm  in 
length and 2.6 cm in diameter for the fission chamber and 4.4 cm in length and 1.9 cm in diameter 
for  the  ion  chamber.  Figure  3  represents  the  monitoring  results  for  the  extracted  neutrons  and 
gamma-rays. From the figure, it is confirmed that the two beam monitoring systems were operated 
successfully for a safe and exact irradiation for the whole power range of the reactor.

2.5. Irradiation room 
The irradiation room was designed not only for the neutron irradiation but also for the temporary 
surgical operation. A sufficient space in front of the beam exit was prepared for various alignments 
of a patient's bed according to the irradiation position. A neutron shielding structure composed of 
borated  plastic  sheets  and  borosilicate  glass  will  surround  the  patient  during  an  irradiation.  This 
neutron shielding tent prevents the materials inside the room from being activated, and it allows a 
medical  team  to  access  the  room  immediately  after  an  irradiation.  The  patient  can  be  monitored 
through the borosilicate glass via a video camera. 

The  radiation  level  in  the  room  is  kept  sufficiently  low  during  the  preparation  and  the  post 
actions of an irradiation due to the water shutter. During the beam extraction, the gamma-ray and 
neutron dose rates outside the irradiation room are also low enough for any other research activity 
of the reactor to be undertaken. The distance from the beam exit to the wall of the room is about 
200  cm  to  550  cm,  and  the  height  of  the  irradiation  room  is  about  350  cm.  Figure  4  shows  an 
inside view of the irradiation room. 

3. Measurements of the beam characteristics 

3.1. Neutron beam 

Experimental  measurements  of  the  neutron  beam  characteristics  were  performed  by  using 
bare and cadmium covered gold foils and wires (International Atomic Energy Agency 1970). First 
of all, the absolute neutron fluxes and the cadmium ratio were measured at several points on the 
surfaces of the beam exit hole, the Li-6 contained beam collimator and the front shielding by using 

Development and characteristics of the HANARO ex-core neutron irradiation facility 

            7 

gold  foils.  The  thickness  of  the  gold  foil  was  0.0254  mm,  and  its  diameter  was  12.7  mm.  The 
cadmium ratio was measured by using the same gold foils and a cadmium cap with a thickness of 
0.5 mm. Secondly, the radial neutron flux distribution at the exit surface was measured by using a 
bare  gold  wire  and  a  gold  wire  inserted  into  a  cadmium  tube  with  a  thickness  of  0.5  mm.  The 
diameters  of  the  Au  wires  were  either  0.1  or  0.254  mm.  And  then,  the  axial  neutron  flux 
distribution as a function of the axial distance from the beam exit surface was investigated. Finally, 
the  two-dimensional  in-phantom  neutron  flux  distribution  was  measured.  For  a  mapping  of  the 
neutron  flux  distribution  inside  the  phantom,  a  number  of  gold  monitors  were  located  at 
appropriate  positions  inside  the  slab  phantom.  The  phantom  used  in  the  experiments  was  a 
300×300 mm2 rectangular solid slab phantom. Its density was 1.045 g/cm3, and it was composed of 
several slabs with thicknesses of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mm.

The time required to open the water shutter for a neutron irradiation was about 3 minutes, and 
that to close it was about 2 minutes. Thus, the irradiation time cannot be determined clearly, unlike 
a  quick  shutter  system.  In  order  to  investigate  the  variation  of  the  neutron  irradiation  rate  at  the 
flux monitor position, the variation of the count rate of the fission chamber was measured during a 
shutter  operation.  The  neutron  beam  parameters  were  measured  with  the  variation  of  the  liquid 
nitrogen cooling condition of the radiation filter. All these experiments were performed at a reactor 
power of 24 MW, while the nominal power of HANARO is 30 MW.   

The  activity  of  the  irradiated  gold  sample  was  measured  by  using  a  calibrated  high  purity 
germanium  detector  system.  The  uncertainty  in  determining  the  activity  was  within  2%,  and  the 
dominant  factor  was  the  uncertainty  of  the  standard  source  activity  used  in  the  calibration 
procedure. 
 

3.2. Gamma-ray dose 
The  gamma-ray  dose  of  this  facility  was  measured  by  using  TLD-700  thermoluminescence 
dosimeter.  The  specifications  of  the  TLD  dosimeter  used  in  this  experiment  are  represented  in 
table 2. TLD-700 dosimeter is usually assumed to measure the gamma-ray dose only because the 
content of Li-6 in it is below about 0.04%. However, the Li-6 induced signal within the TLD-700 

Development and characteristics of the HANARO ex-core neutron irradiation facility 

            8 

may  not  be  negligible  when  it  is  exposed  to  relatively  large  thermal  neutron  fluences  like  this 
BNCT irradiation (Attix 1986, Raaijmakers et al 1996). 

In  order  to  eliminate  the  thermal  neutron  contribution  to  the  TLD-700  dosimeter,  we 
irradiated  the  TLD-700  dosimeters  covered  with  6LiF  tiles  (Kumada  et  al  2004).  The  6LiF  tile 
(95 % enriched in Li-6) was made by a sintering procedure from the powder. The size of the tile 
was 4.0×4.0 cm2, and its thickness was 4 mm. The density of the sintered tile was 2.25 g/cm3, and 
the transmission of the neutron through the tile was negligible. The calibration of the TLD for the 
gamma-rays  was  performed  by  the  Co-60  standard  source.  The  dose  values  from  the  irradiated 
dosimeters were determined by using Harshaw Reader Model 3500.

4. Results 
 

4.1. Characteristics of the neutron beam 
Figure  5  shows  the  relative  count  rate  of  the  fission  chamber  (FC)  installed  inside  the  front 
shielding to monitor the beam extraction according to an operation of the water shutter. As shown 
in  the  figure,  an  additional  irradiation  during  the  shutter  opening  ( 1t ~ 2t )  and  closing  ( 3t ~ 4t ) 
should be considered to accurately estimate the total neutron fluence delivered to the target. The 
thermal  neutron  flux  at  this  facility, 
0φ   should  be  deduced  from  the  flux  monitor  which  was 
irradiated  with  the  shutter  operation.  We  supposed  that  a  neutron  irradiation  at  a  position  of  the 
flux monitor during the shutter operation varied linearly as shown by the solid line in figure 5. If 
1t   is  set  to  be  zero,  the  neutron  flux  can  be  deduced  from  the  activity  of  the  flux  monitor  as 
follows.

Since a mono-directional neutron beam is extracted through the long beam tube, the neutron 
attenuation effect inside the gold flux monitors was calculated by considering the pathlength of the 
neutron inside the monitor. The correction factors for the neutron attenuation were 0.9758 for the 
gold wire with a 0.1 mm in diameter and 0.9402 for that with a 0.254 mm in diameter, respectively. 
In the case of the gold foil with a thickness of 0.0254 mm, the correction was negligible. 

Table 3 shows the thermal neutron flux measured by using gold foils at several positions on 
the  surface  of  the  beam  exit  hole  and  the  surroundings.  The  radiation  filter  was  at  room 
temperature, and the reactor power was 24 MW. The neutron flux outside the beam collimator is 
much smaller than that inside the beam extraction area. The cadmium ratio measured at the center 
of the beam exit hole is 104.

Figure  6  shows  the  relative  activity  distributions  of  bare  and  cadmium  covered  gold  wires 
irradiated at the beam exit surface in order to measure the neutron beam distributions. The activity 
distributions of the wires were scanned by a HPGe detector with the lead shielding and a front slit 
of 4 mm in width. The area of the 411 keV gamma-ray peak from the Au-198 was more than 3,000. 
As shown in the figure, it is confirmed that both the thermal and fast neutron irradiations outside 
the collimation area are negligible. The neutron irradiation is concentrated well inside the aperture 
of  the  Li-6  contained  beam  collimator.  In  the  case  of  the  collimator  of  15  cm  in  diameter,  the 
radial neutron beam distributions inside ±5 cm from the beam center seem to be flat. In that region, 
the  maximum  deviation  between  the  measurements  is  7%.  The  uncertainty  of  the  activity 
measurement  is  about  3~4%,  including  the  uncertainties  arising  from  the  non-uniformity  in  the 
gold wire diameter and a possible bending of the wire.

The  absolute  neutron  flux  and  Cd  ratio  measured  at  different  experimental  conditions  are 
represented  in  table  4.  The  uncertainty  of  the  measured  flux  is  within  2.5%.  When  the  radiation 
filter is cooled with liquid nitrogen, the neutron flux and Cd ratio increase by over 40%. It means 
that the increase of the thermal neutron flux due to the cooling of the radiation filter is rather big. 
From  figure  3(a),  we  expect  that  the  neutron  flux  from  the  beam  exit  would  be  linearly 
proportional to the reactor power. Thus, we can estimate the thermal neutron fluxes at the reactor 
power of 30 MW from the measurements at 24 MW, and they are represented in table 4. For the 
free  beam  extraction  without  phantom,  the  differences  between  the  expected  values  from  the 
measurements  and  the  calculated  ones  by  using  the  MCNP  are  less  than  10%  regardless  of  the 
cooling  condition  of  the  radiation  filter.  These  differences  are  very  small  when  considering  the 
various  uncertainty  sources  in  the  MCNP  calculation  and  the  experimental  condition.  In  the 
experiment, the main contributions to this difference are the uncertainty in the temperature of the 
crystal of the radiation filter and the change of the reactor core conditions such as a disposition of 
the  nuclear  fuel.  In  the  calculation,  the  neutron  cross-section  of  the  bismuth  single  crystal  may 
have a big uncertainty because it has high density of reciprocal lattice points and the large mosaic

spread (Rustad et al 1965). It is concluded that the thermal neutron flux and the Cd ratio which can 
be obtained at this facility are 1.49×109 n/cm2s and 152, respectively, at 30 MW reactor power.

When  the  phantom  is  installed  in  front  of  the  beam  exit,  the  measured  neutron  flux  at  the 
phantom surface increases by twofold or more than that without phantom. The calculated thermal 
neutron flux on the phantom surface is 30% larger than the measured value. The difference may be 
attributed  to  the  uncertainties  of  the  physical  and  nuclear  data  of  the  phantom  materials,  the 
characteristics  of  the  MCNP  calculation,  the  self  shielding  effect  of  the  gold  samples  and  the 
different  core  conditions.  The  uncertainty  of  the  MCNP  result  at  the  boundary  of  the  medium 
materials  with  very  different  nuclear  characteristics  may  be  increased  due  to  its  tally  averaging 
characteristics.  The  self  shielding  effects  of  the  gold  foil  and  wire  irradiated  under  a  parallel 
neutron  beam  can  be  deduced  easily.  When  a  phantom  is  installed,  the  number  of  scattered 
neutrons  by  the  phantom  is  increased  considerably  and  the  directional  changes  of  the  scattered 
neutrons will make their pathlengths in the sample longer. Further study is required to examine the 
cause of the difference between the measurements and the calculation through a precise analysis. 

Figure 7 shows the measured and calculated neutron fluxes as a function of the distance from 
the beam exit surface when the radiation filter is maintained at room temperature, and the reactor 
power is 24 MW. In the figure, the solid line represents the fitting result to the calculated values 
over a distance of 45 cm from the beam exit with the following equation.

where, 458 means the distance from the nose to the exit of the beam tube in cm. This fitting line is 
not consistent with the calculated values within 45 cm. The main contribution to the neutron flux 
over 45 cm is the neutrons that are extracted undergoing very small angle collisions or without any 
collision through the beam path from the nose. Therefore, the neutron flux over 45 cm follows the 
2/1 r   law, where  r   is the distance from the source. Near to the beam exit, the neutrons scattered 
2/1 r  
by  the  surrounding  materials  such  as  silicon,  bismuth  and  collimator  are  added  to  the 
component of the neutron flux. Therefore, the neutron flux abruptly increases when approaching 
the beam exit from outside.

Fig. 7. Measured and calculated neutron fluxes as a function of the distance from the beam exit 
surface. 
 

Figure 8 shows the measured and the calculated neutron flux distributions as a function of the 
depth in the phantom along the central axis of the beam exit. The measured thermal neutron flux 
reaches  a  maximum  near  a  3  mm  depth  in  the  phantom,  and  then  it  decreases  rapidly.  The 
maximum flux is about 25 % larger than that at the phantom surface, and the measured value at a 
depth of 22 mm in the phantom is about a half of the maximum value. When the radiation filter is 
cooled by liquid nitrogen (LN2), the thermal neutron flux is 30% larger than that without cooling. 
As  shown  in  the  table  4  and  figure  8,  it  is  confirmed  that  the  calculated  neutron  fluxes  at  the 
surface or inside the phantom are about 30% larger than the measured ones while the two neutron 
flux distributions show the same trend. 

The  measured  two-dimensional  in-phantom  neutron  flux  distribution  is  shown  in  figure  9. 
Significant neutron irradiation is observed within 20 mm from the phantom surface (Yamamoto et 
al 2002, Kim et al 2004). The area enclosed by the isoflux line of 2×109 n/cm2s or more is located 
within  a  12  mm  depth  in  the  phantom.  The  2×109  n/cm2s  flux  is  about  77  %  relative  to  the 
maximum  flux.  The  neutron  flux  distribution  near  the  phantom  surface  looks  as  though  it  has  a 
double  isoflux  area  enclosed  by  the  2.6×109  line  in  the  lateral  direction.  This  area  has  the 
maximum  neutron  flux,  and  it  is  caused  by  the  flux  peaking  inside  the  phantom  due  to  the 
scattered neutrons by the collimator. The thermal neutron flux falls off rapidly outside 50 mm in 
the lateral direction. The measured neutron flux distribution inside the phantom may be utilized in 
the  irradiation  planning,  such  as  determining  the  optimal  size  of  the  collimator  and  the  optimal 
position for a patient's head. 
 
4.2. Gamma-ray dose 
The gamma-ray dose at this facility is measured with TLD-700 dosimeter by eliminating the effect 
of the thermal neutron by using 6LiF tile. The contribution of the fast neutron is neglected due to 
its low flux and small reaction cross-sections. Table 5 shows the measured gamma-ray dose rates 
at  several  points  on  the  beam  exit  surface  when  the  radiation  filter  is  cooled  by  liquid  nitrogen. 
Since the reactor was operated at 24 MW, the gamma-ray dose rate at 30 MW, the nominal power

of HANARO, is expected  to be about 80 cGy/hr. The gamma-ray dose rate outside of the beam 
collimator is negligible.

the MCNP calculation. The fractional standard deviations of the calculated values at 26 cm and 46

5. Conclusion 

The HANARO ex-core neutron irradiation facility was developed by using a tangential beam tube 
for various applications in the boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) field. Considering that not 
enough  epithermal  neutrons  for  the  BNCT  can  be  obtained  at  the  irradiation  position  due  to  the 
design  characteristics  of  HANARO,  a  thermal  neutron  facility  for  various  applications  was 
designed by means of a fast neutron and gamma-ray filtering method. The radiation filter consists 
of a silicon single crystal for a maximum extraction of a thermal neutron and a bismuth crystal for 
a  gamma-ray  shielding.  A  water  shutter  in  front  of  the  radiation  filter  was  installed  in  order  to 
perform  various  research  activities  without  any  interference  due  to  an  operation  of  the  BNCT 
facility. The basic facilities for the BNCT were installed and the irradiation room was constructed 
where even a temporal surgical operation could be conducted.   

Development and characteristics of the HANARO ex-core neutron irradiation facility 

            15 

The major parameters for the BNCT application such as the neutron flux distributions were 
determined. The thermal neutron flux and the Cd ratio available from this facility for a condition 
of  no  phantom  and  the  radiation  filter  cooled  by  liquid  nitrogen  are  1.49×109  n/cm2s  and  152, 
respectively.  The  gamma-ray  dose  rate  at  the  beam  exit  for  a  free  beam  condition  is  about  80 
cGy/hr. This HANARO thermal neutron facility can be used not only for a clinical trial but also 
for various treatment researches of the BNCT field.

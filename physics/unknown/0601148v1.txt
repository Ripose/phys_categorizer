Optimum  projection  angles  for  achieving  maximum  horizontal  range  in  throwing  and  jumping  events  are 
considerably  less  than  45°.  This  unexpected  result  arises  because  an  athlete  can  generate  a  greater 
projection  velocity  at  low  projection  angles  than  at  high  angles.  The  range  of  a  projectile  is  strongly 
dependent on projection speed and so the optimum projection angle is biased towards low projection angles. 
Here  we  examine  the  velocity-angle  relation  and  the  optimum  projection  angle  in  selected  throwing  and 
jumping events. 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 

 
Several throwing and jumping activities involve projecting 
a ball, implement, or the human body for maximum horizontal 
range. One might expect that the optimum projection angle for 
these  activities  would  be  about  45°.  However,  video 
measurements have revealed that sports projectiles are usually 
launched at angles much lower than 45° (Table I).

  Aerodynamic forces and the height difference between the 
launch  and  landing  are  not  the  main  causes  of  the  low 
projection angles. For all the events listed in Table I the height 
difference  between  the  launch  and  landing  reduces  the 
optimum  projection  angle  by  no  more  than  a  few  degrees.8,9 
Although  aerodynamic  lift  and  drag  can  substantially  affect 
the  range  of  a  sports  projectile,  the  effect  on  the  optimum 
projection  angle  is  relatively  small.  Aerodynamics  forces 
reduce  the  optimum  projection  angle  in  the  javelin  throw, 
discus throw, and soccer throw-in by only a few degrees.7,10,11 
In  the  hammer  throw  the  effect  is  less  than  one  degree  and 
there  is  almost  no  effect  in  the  shot  put,  long  jump,  and 
standing long jump.6,9,12,13 
 
The main reason for the low projection angles in throwing 
and  jumping  is  that  the  projection  velocity  an  athlete  can 
produce  decreases  with  increasing  projection  angle.14  The 
musculoskeletal  structure  of  the  human  body  is  such  that  an 
athlete  can  generate  a  greater  projection  velocity  in  the 
horizontal direction than in the vertical direction. Because the 
range  of  a  projectile  is  strongly  dependent  on  the  projection 
velocity,  even  a  small  dependence  of  projection  velocity  on 

projection angle is sufficient to lower the optimum projection 
angle to substantially below 45°. 

jump,  and  soccer 

 
The  present  article  summarizes  recent  work  on  the 
optimum projection angles in the shot put, long jump, standing 
throw-in.15–18  We  used  video 
long 
measurements to experimentally determine the dependence of 
projection  velocity  on  the  angle  of  projection.19  The  athlete’s 
optimum  projection  angle  was  calculated  by  substituting  the 
velocity-angle  relation  into  the  equations  for  the  flight 
trajectory  of  the  projectile.  This  method  produced  good 
agreement  between  the  calculated  optimum  projection  angles 
and  the  athletes’  preferred  projection  angles.  The  principles 
presented  in  this  article  have  application  to  all  throwing  and 
jumping  events  in  which  the  aim  is  to  project  a  sports 
projectile for maximum horizontal range. For further details of 
the  measurement 
techniques,  mathematical  models, 
experimental  results  and  uncertainties,  the  interested  reader 
should consult the original papers.14–18 
Projectile motion is one of the staple topics in a mechanics 
 
course, and educators often use sporting examples in an effort 
to  capture  the  student’s  interest.  The  shot  put  and  long  jump 
are  suitable  for  discussion  in  an  introductory  undergraduate 
class  as  the  sports  projectile  can  be  assumed  to  be  in  free 
flight. The soccer throw-in, hammer throw, javelin throw, and 
discus  throw  require  an  aerodynamic  treatment  and  are  more 
suited for advanced classes. In our experience, many students 
find  research  projects  in  which  video  measurements  are 
performed on athletes to be particularly engaging. 

 
II.  SHOT PUT 

 
The shot put (Fig. 1) is the best-known example in which a 
sports implement behaves as a projectile in free flight. When a 
projectile  is  launched  from  ground  level  over  a  horizontal 
plane the range of the projectile is given by R = (v2 sin 2θ)/g, 
where  v  is  the  projection  velocity, θ  is  the  projection  angle, 
and  g  is  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity.  In  shot-putting  the 
athlete  launches  the  shot  from  above  ground  level  and  so  the 
range is given by; 

 

    R  =

where  h  is  the  height  difference  between  launch  and  landing. 
The optimum projection angle may be determined by graphical 
techniques  or  by  differentiation.  For  example,  if  an  athlete 
projects the shot from 2.1 m above the ground at a projection 
velocity  of  13  m/s,  the  optimum  projection  angle  is  42°.9

some  velocity-angle  data  may  be  as  simple  as  a  linear 
expression, but a better approach is to use an expression that is 
based  on  a  mathematical  model  of  shot-putting,  such  as  that 
described below.

observed relation between projection velocity and projection angle for 
the athlete (Fig. 2) into the equation for the range of a projectile in free 
flight [Eq. (1)].  The optimum projection angle for this athlete is about 
31º.  The  dashed  lines  are  the  calculated  range  of  a  shot,  assuming 
constant  values  of  projection  velocity  and  a  height  difference  of  h  = 
2.1 m. Adapted with permission. 

 
B. Model of projection velocity 

 
The  projection  phase  of  the  shot  put  may  be  modeled  by 
assuming  the  athlete  applies  a  constant  force  F  to  the  shot.15 
This  force  accelerates  the  shot  from  rest  along  a  straight  line 
path l to produce a projection velocity v. Applying the law of 
conservation  of  energy  to  the  projection  phase  gives  an 
expression for the projection velocity; 

 

    v  =

m   ,

  Unfortunately,  Eq. 
the 
experimental data (Fig. 2) as it says that the projection velocity 
is  the  same  at  all  projection  angles.  In  the  above  model  we 
assumed that the force exerted by the athlete on the shot is the 
same for all projection angles, but in practice the human body 
can  produce  a  greater  throwing  force  in  the  horizontal 
direction  than  in  the  vertical  direction.  Assuming  the  force 
exerted  by  the  athlete  on  the  shot  decreases  linearly  with 
projection angle, we obtain; 

 

v(θ)  =  

2(Fo – aθ)l
m

 

  , 

where  Fo  is  the  average  force  exerted  on  the  shot  for  a 
horizontal  projection  angle,  and  a 
that 
characterizes  the  athlete’s  force  decrease  with  increasing 
projection angle.

A. Projection velocity 

 
The error in the above method of determining the optimum 
projection angle is that we assumed the projection velocity v is 
independent  of  the  projection  angle  θ.  Our  experiments  on 
shot-putters  have  shown  that  an  athlete  can  project  the  shot 
faster  at  low  projection  angles  than  at  high  projection  angles. 
Figure  2  shows  data  for  a  male  college  shot-putter.15  To 
determine  the  athlete’s  optimum  projection  angle  we  must 
obtain  a  mathematical  expression  for  the  athlete’s  relation 
between  projection  velocity  and  projection  angle,  v(θ),  and 
then substitute this expression into Eq. (1). The result is shown 
in Fig. 3. Note that the calculated optimum projection angle is 
now much less than 42°.

In an introductory class on projection angles in sports the 
student  can  generate  Fig.  3  using  a  spreadsheet  and  graphing 
program  such  as  Microsoft  Excel.  Asking  the  student  to 
generate  the  dashed  curves  in  Fig.  3  is  a  useful  exercise  to 
illustrate  how  the  conventional  (but  incorrect)  optimum 
projection angle of just under 45° is obtained. The student can 
be  given  the  mathematical  expression  for  v(θ),  or  it  can  be 
obtained  by  fitting  an  appropriate  curve  to  some  real  data 

 

Equation (3) gives a good fit to the experimental data. For 
 
the  male  shot-putter  shown  in  Fig.  2  the  acceleration  path 
length is l = 1.65 m, the average force exerted for a horizontal 
throw is Fo = 460 N, and the rate of decrease in force is a = 4.1 
N/degree. The calculated values of l and Fo agree with values 
obtained  from  a  video  analysis  of  world-class  male  shot-
putters, and the value of a is similar to that expected from the 
difference in weight lifted between a bench press exercise (160 
kg at θ ≈ 0°) and a shoulder press exercise (120 kg at θ ≈ 90°). 
A more accurate model of the projection phase would include 
the  effect  of  gravity  on  the  motion  of  the  shot.  However,  in 
shot-putting Fo >> mg and so the weight of the shot has only a 
small influence on the athlete’s projection angle. 

  A student can use the model presented here to investigate 
the effects of the athlete’s strength and throwing technique on 
the  maximum  range  and  the  optimum  projection  angle.  The 
average force Fo is related to the athlete’s overall strength, and 
a is some complex function of the athlete’s throwing technique 
and the relative strengths of the muscles used in the throwing 
movement.  Male  athletes  have  values  of  Fo  of  between  100 
and 800 N, and a lies between 2 and 5 N/degree. An athlete’s 
maximum  range  is  mostly  determined  by  the  value  of  Fo, 
whereas the optimum projection angle is mostly determined by 
the value of a. The greater the rate of decrease in velocity, the 
lower the athlete’s optimum projection angle. 

 
C. Projection height 

  An  astute  student  will  notice  that  in  Eq.  (1)  the  height 
difference  h  may  also  be  a  function  of  the  projection  angle. 
Figure 4 shows projection height data for a male college shot-
putter.15  The  increase  in  projection  height  with  increasing 
projection  angle  arises  from  the  configuration  of  the  athlete’s 
body  at  the  instant  of  release  (Fig.  5).  When  using  a  high 
projection angle the angle of the athlete’s arm to the horizontal 
is greater, and therefore at the instant of release the shot is at a 
greater  height  above  the  ground.  The  relation  between  the 
height difference and the projection angle is given by 

 

h(θ)  =  hshoulder + larmsinθ  – rshot , 

(4) 

where  hshoulder  is  the  height  of  the  athlete’s  shoulders  when 
standing upright, larm is the length of the athlete’s outstretched 
throwing arm and shoulder, and rshot is the radius of the shot (6 
cm for men, and 5 cm for women). The values of hshoulder and 
larm  obtained from the fitted curve in Fig. 4 (1.68 m and 0.87 
m) are in reasonable agreement with actual body dimensions. 

 
The  effect  of  the  projection  height  on  the  optimum 
projection angle is calculated by substituting the expression for 
h(θ) into Eq. (1), along with the expression for the projection 
velocity  v(θ)  obtained  previously.  In  an  introductory  class  on 
projection  angles  in  sports  the  student  can  be  given  the 
mathematical  expression  for  h(θ),  or  it  can  be  obtained  by 
fitting Eq. (4) to some real data. For most people, the height of 
the shoulders when standing upright (hshoulder) and the length of 
the  outstretched  arm  and  shoulder  (larm)  are  about  82%  and 
52% of their standing height. The student will find that unlike 
the  relation  for  projection  velocity  v(θ),  the  relation  for 
projection  height  h(θ)  has  little  influence  on  the  athlete’s 
optimum projection angle.

D. Video measurements of shot-putters 

  An experimental study of the optimum projection angle in 
the  shot  put  makes  an  engaging  student  research  project.19  A 
domestic video camera operating at 25 or 30 Hz is suitable for 
recording  sports  movements,  but  you  may  have  to  invest  in 
some  decent  biomechanical  analysis  software.  We  use  APAS 
software20 as it is able to separate the two fields that make up 
each video frame and hence double the video sampling rate to 
50 or 60 Hz. APAS has a module for smoothing the data using 
a digital filter, and the most appropriate cut-off frequency for 
the  filter  is  selected  by  examining  the  power  spectrum  of  the 
video data. The student will also learn how to calibrate a video 
image so as to convert pixel coordinates on a video image into 
real-world  coordinates.  In  a  student  research  project  the 
calculated  optimum  projection  angle  may  be  compared  to the 
athlete’s  preferred  projection  angle  or  to  the  measured  throw 
distances (Fig. 6).

III.  LONG JUMP 

 
In jumping, the projectile is the human body, rather than a 
sports implement or sports ball. A long jumper in flight has a 
low  drag-to-weight  ratio  and  so  acts  like  a  projectile  in  free 
flight. We can therefore use the same technique for calculating 
the optimum projection angle as that used for the shot put.  

 
Figure 7 shows the velocity-angle relation for a male long 
jumper.16 In long jumping, the projection velocity is produced 
through a combination of horizontal velocity developed in the 
run-up and vertical velocity generated during the take-off. The 
highest  projection  velocities  are  obtained  when  the  jumper 
uses  a  fast  run-up  and  then  attempts  to  jump  up  as  much  as 
possible.  However,  long  jumpers  cannot  attain  projection 
angles greater than about 25° using this technique. To achieve 
greater projection angles the athlete must use a slower run-up 
and  so  the  projection  velocity  is  reduced.  In  the  extreme 
situation  of  a  near-vertical  projection  angle,  the  run-up 
velocity must be reduced to walking pace and so the projection 
velocity is at its lowest.

  We  have  not  been  able  to  develop  a  simple  mathematical 
model  of  jumping  that  reproduces  the  observed  relation 
between projection velocity and projection angle (Fig. 7), but a 
symmetric  logistic  function  produces  a  good  empirical  fit  to 
the data;16 

 

v(θ)  =

(5) 

vmax – vmin
θ 

1 + 

where vmax is the asymptotic maximum projection velocity (as 
when running straight through the take-off, where θ ≈ 0°), vmin 
is  the  asymptotic  minimum  projection  velocity  (as  in  an 
upwards vertical jump from one leg, where θ ≈ 90°), θinf is the 
value  of  the  projection  angle  at  the  inflection  point  of  the 
curve, and a is the slope coefficient. For the male long jumper 
shown in Fig. 7, vmax = 9.9 m/s, vmin = 3.9 m/s, θinf = 30°, and a 
= 6.8. 

  Our  measurements  show  that  although  the  take-off  and 
landing heights both increase with increasing projection angle, 
the  height  difference  between  the  two  remains  approximately 
constant at about h = 0.5 m. The athlete’s optimum projection 
angle is calculated by substituting the expressions for v(θ) and 
h(θ) into Eq. (1). Figure 8 shows that the calculated optimum 
projection angle is about 21°, which is in good agreement with 
the angle used by this athlete in competition.

In  long  jumping  the  total  jump  distance  is  slightly  more 
 
than  the  horizontal  distance  traveled  through  the  air  (the 
“flight distance”). The athlete’s center of mass at the instant of 
take-off is ahead of the take-off line, and the center of mass at 
the instant of landing is behind the mark made in the sand by 
the  jumper’s  feet  (Fig.  9).  Both  the  take-off  and  landing 
distances depend on configuration of the athlete’s body, which 
in  turn  depend  on  the  projection  angle.  The  observed 
dependence  of  the  take-off  and  landing  distances  on  the 
projection  angle  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.  However,  these 
component distances make relatively small contributions to the 
total  jump  distance  and  have  little  effect  on  the  optimum 
projection angle.

  A  student  research  project  on  the  optimum  projection 
angle in the long jump is more complex than for the shot put. 
The APAS software can calculate the location of the center of 
mass  of  the  human  body  (using  representative  data  for  the 
masses  of  the  body  segments).  However,  this  requires  the 
student to digitize 18 body points on each video image and is a 
time consuming process. A less tedious alternative is to use the 
athlete’s  hips  as  an  estimate  of  the  location  of  the  athlete’s 
center of mass. 

 
IV.  SOCCER THROW-IN 

  A soccer ball is a moderately aerodynamic projectile, and 
when  kicked  or  thrown  the  range  of  the  ball  is  substantially 
reduced  by  aerodynamic  drag.  The  optimum  projection  angle 
in  a  throw  or  kick  may  be  calculated  as  before,  but  we  must 
use aerodynamic equations to calculate the flight trajectory of 
the  ball.  We  conducted  a  study  of  the  optimum  projection 
angle  in  the  soccer  throw-in  where  the  ball  was  deliberately 
projected  with  little  or  no  spin  so  as  to  eliminate  the 
confounding  effects  of  aerodynamic  lift.  Figure  10  shows  the 
velocity-angle relation for a male athlete.18 
 

between the projection velocity and projection angle is mostly 
determined  by  the  musculoskeletal  structure  of  the  human 
body.  We  assume  that  the  force  exerted  by  the  athlete  on  the 
ball  decreases  linearly  with  projection  angle.  The  expression 
for  the  relation  between  projection  velocity  and  projection 
angle  is  then  given  by  Eq.  (3).  For  the  fitted  curve  shown  in 
Fig. 10 the acceleration path length is l = 1.14 m, the average 
force exerted for a horizontal throw is Fo = 46 N, and the rate 
of decrease in force is a = 0.44 N/degree. 

 
In  a  soccer  throw-in  the  projection  height  of  the  ball 
increases slightly with increasing projection angle, from about 
2.0 m in a horizontal throw to about 2.4 m in a vertical throw. 
As in the shot put, this relation arises from the geometry of the 
throwing action. 

The flight trajectory equations of the soccer ball are;18

where v is the instantaneous velocity of the ball relative to the 
air. The constant k is given by k = ρS/(2m), where ρ is the air 
density (1.225 kg/m3 at sea level and 15ºC), and S is the cross-
sectional area of the ball (0.038 m2). At speeds typical of the 
soccer  throw-in,  a  soccer  ball  has  a  drag  coefficient  of  about 
CD = 0.2, and for a ball that is projected with zero spin the lift 
coefficient is about CL = 0. 
The initial conditions for the flight trajectory equations are 
 
generated from the athlete’s expressions for v(θ) and h(θ). The 
flight  trajectory  equations  are  nonlinear,  and  so  we  used  the 
numerical solution capabilities of Mathematica to calculate the 
flight  trajectories.  For  the  athlete  in  this  study  the  optimum 
projection  angle  was  about  30°  (Fig.  11).  As  in  the  other 
throwing  and  jumping  events  discussed  here,  the  projection 
velocity  relation  v(θ)  has  a  strong  effect  on  the  optimum 
projection  angle  whereas  the  projection  height  relation  h(θ) 
has almost no effect.

The  projection  phase  of  the  throw  may  be  modeled  by 
assuming the athlete accelerates the ball by exerting a constant

V.  OTHER EVENTS 

A. Standing long jump 

 
The standing long jump is no longer contested in athletics 
meets, but it is still used as a test of leg power, particularly for 
athletes  in  sports  that  involve  running  and  jumping.  In  the 
standing long jump the athlete’s projection velocity decreases 
with  increasing  projection  angle,  mostly  because  the  athlete 
must  overcome  an  increasing  fraction  of  his  body  weight.17 
The  athlete’s  projection  height  and  landing  height  both 
increase  with  increasing  projection  angle,  but  the  height 
difference between the two remains approximately constant at 
about h = 0.2 m. Substituting the athlete’s expressions for v(θ) 
and  h(θ)  into  the  equation  for  a  projectile  in  free  flight  [Eq. 
(1)] gives a projection angle that maximizes the flight distance 
of about 35°. In a standing long jump the take-off and landing 
distances make relatively large contributions to the total jump 
distance and the optimum projection angle for the total jump is 
about 25°. 

 
B. Hammer throw 

  We have not yet determined the optimum projection angle 
in  the  hammer  throw  using  the  techniques  presented  in  this 
article.  The  mass of a hammer is the same as a shot (7.26 kg 
for men, and 4.00 kg for women), but aerodynamic drag is not 
quite  negligible  in  the  hammer  throw.  Typical  projection 
velocities  in  the  hammer  throw  (v  ≈  25  m/s)  are  about  twice 
those in the shot put, and the drag area of the hammer is about 
twice  as  great  as  the  shot  because  of  the  attached  handle  and 
wire.21  Aerodynamic  drag  in  the  hammer  throw  reduces  the 
range by about 5% and reduces the optimum projection angle 
by  just  under  1º.  To  the  best    of  our  knowledge  there  is  no 
published  information  on  the  velocity-angle  relation  for 
throwing a hammer. We suspect a relatively weak dependence 
because measured projection angles are only a little below 45º. 

 
C. Javelin throw and discus throw 

  An analysis of the optimum projection angle in the javelin 
throw  or  discus  throw  is  probably  only  suitable  for  an 
advanced  student  project  as  the  aerodynamic  flight  equations 
are  relatively  complex.11,14  The  flight  trajectory  of  a  javelin 
depends on the angle of attack, angle of yaw, rate of pitch, and 
rate  of  spin,  and  these  parameters  change  during  the  flight. 
Likewise,  the  flight  of  a  discus  is  affected  by  the  angle  of 
attack  and  rate  of  spin.  The  velocity-angle  relation  for 
throwing  a  javelin  is  to  be  found  in  Ref.  14,  but  there  is  no 
corresponding information for throwing a discus.

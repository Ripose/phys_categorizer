Abstract

We present a novel method for analyzing Small Angle X-ray Scattering data on multilamellar

phospholipid bilayer systems at full hydration. The method utilizes a modified Caillé theory

structure factor in combination with a Gaussian model representation of the electron density

profile  such  that  it  accounts  also  for  the  diffuse  scattering  between  Bragg  peaks.  Thus,  the

method  can  retrieve  structural  information  even  if  only  a  few  orders  of  diffraction  are

observed. We further introduce a new procedure to derive fundamental parameters, such as

area per lipid, membrane thickness, and number of water molecules per lipid, directly from

the  electron  density  profile  without  the  need  of  additional  volumetric  measurements.  The

theoretical  apparatus  is  applied  to  experimental  data  on  1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-

phosphocholine 

and 

1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 

liposome

preparations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Phospholipids  are  the  main  constituents  of  biological  membranes  by  forming  the  structural

matrix  into  which  functional  membrane  units  such  as  proteins  are  imbedded.  Among  the

various structures that are formed by phospholipid membranes, the lamellar liquid crystalline

phase  is  the  biologically  most  relevant  one.  The  interest  in  the  structure  and  physical

properties  of  this  particular  phase  has  therefore  always  been  an  important  subject  in

biophysical and biochemical research, since the structure is directly related to the function of

the  molecular  aggregates.  But  not  only  the  efforts  to  understand  the  function  of  biological

membranes  drive  the  progress  in  phospholipid  structure  research,  also  phospholipid-based

rational  drug  design  and  bio-mimetic  material  development  rely  on  physical  interaction

predictions.

The  structural  characterization  of  phospholipid  model  membranes  was  initiated  by  the

pioneering  work  of  Luzzati  and  coworkers  [1,  2]  on  unoriented  multilayers  of  diacyl-

phosphocholines  and  was  followed  by  a  large  number  of  X-ray  and  neutron  scattering

experiments  on  different  phospholipid  bilayer  structures  [3,  4].  However,  the  major

difficulties in obtaining accurate structural data arise, apart from thermal disorder ("disorder

of first kind"), from disorder in the crystal lattice ("disorder of second kind"), which is mostly

dominant  in  the  liquid  crystalline  phases  due  to  their  liquid  properties.  Two  theories  have

been developed to model the lattice structure factor of model membranes, both accounting for

the  deficiencies  in  long  range  order:  the  paracrystalline  theory  (PT),  a  general  theory  for

disorder of first and the second kind originated by Hosemann and Bagchi [5] and Guinier [6],

and the Caillé theory (CT) [7], which was invoked for smectic liquid crystals only. The main

difference between the two models is that the paracrystalline theory describes the stochastic

3

fluctuations of the single, ideally flat layers, whereas the Caillé theory considers also bilayer

undulations by applying a  Hamiltonian description derived from the free energy density of a

lipid bilayer, originally derived by De Gennes [8]. In 1994 the Caillé theory was modified by

Zhang et al. [9] (MCT), in order to take the finite size of the lamellar stack into account; a

similar expression was obtained by Nallet et al. [10]. Both theories (PT & MCT) have been

applied to experimental data [10-17], but with the help of the high resolution capabilities of

modern  synchrotron  radiation  sources  the  superiority  of  the  Caillé  theory  could  clearly  be

demonstrated [15]. The facts therefore encourage to use MCT for smectic A liquid crystals,

and moreover tests on our own data gave better fits for MCT than for a PT model (results not

shown).

But having an employed theory describing well the crystal lattice and thus the position and

shapes  of  the  diffraction  peaks  does  not  overcome  a  principle  problem  of  liquid

crystallography: As a consequence of the lattice disorder multilamellar liposomal suspensions

give hardly rise to a sufficient number of diffraction orders to derive structural information.

Among 

the 

zwitterionic  phospholipids 

the 

situation 

is 

somewhat  better 

for

phosphatidylethanolamine  (PE)  membrane  stacks,  exhibiting  4  Bragg  peaks  throughout  the

whole La -phase, whereas the higher water content in phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers leads

to  a  higher  lattice  disorder  and  thus  to  even  less  diffraction  peaks  observed.  As  a

consequence, the electron density profiles are very poor in detail and likely to be affected by

Fourier  truncation  errors.  There  are  two  ways  to  circumvent  this  problem,  both  applying

osmotic  pressure  techniques.  (1)  One  is  to  incubate  multilamellar  liposomes  in  aqueous

solutions  containing  various  concentrations  of  large,  neutral  polymers  such  as  dextran  or

polyvinylpyrrolidone  (PVP)  [14-21].  With  such  "swelling  experiments"  the  system  is  partly

dehydrated, and consequently the number of observed diffraction orders increases. Structural

4

parameters for the fully hydrated bilayer are then obtained by extrapolating the areas per lipid,

derived from the partly dehydrated systems to full hydration [14-17]. (2) Even more structural

information can be obtained by exposing oriented  multilayers  to  constant  relative  humidity

atmospheres  [21-25]  and  depending  on  the  degree  of  hydration,  up  to  10  diffraction  orders

have  been  recorded  [23,  24].  The  electron  density  profile  from  such  experiments  is  much

richer in information and even allows for a quasimolecular modeling, first applied by Wiener

and  White  [23,  26,  27].  The  phospholipid  molecule  is  partitioned  into  quasimolecular

fragments,  and  the  contribution  of  each  fragment  to  the  bilayer  profile  is  modeled  by  a

Gaussian  distribution.  In  this  manner  structural  details  have  been  obtained  by  a  joint

refinement  of  neutron  and  X-ray  data  sets  [23].  Still,  the  major  drawback  of  measuring

oriented  sample  in  humidity  chambers  is  that  the  bilayer  repeat  does  not  swell  to  the  value

reached in the unoriented case under excess water conditions, even at 100% relative humidity.

Consequently,  the  fully  hydrated  La -phase  cannot  be  exploited  with  this  technique.  The  so-

called  “vapor  pressure  paradox”  has  been  for  a  long  time  a  disputed  topic  in  the  lipid

community. Recently,  Katsaras  installed  a  new  cell  for  oriented  bilayers  [28]  and  could

demonstrate that the vapor pressure paradox originates simply from experimental inadequacy

and has no theoretical background [29]. Hence the ghost of the vapor pressure paradox ceased

haunting  through  the  brains  of  lipid  scientists  and  diffraction  experiments  on  oriented

membrane stacks will be of prime importance in future phospholipid structure research.

However,  unoriented  multilamellar  liposomes  at  full  hydration  are  still  a  frequent

measurement situation. Not least simulations of biological systems and development of new

drugs, e.g., carrier systems, will always demand the work with liposomal dispersions in the

excess  water  situation.  Here  the  information  content  is  very  low,  if  only  Bragg-peaks  are

considered  in  the  data  analysis.  We  invoke  a  model  that  accounts  also  for  the  diffuse

5

scattering  of  the  bilayer  between  diffraction  peaks,  and  thus,  exploits  the  complete  data

recorded in a continuous q-range. In this way our method is capable to retrieve fundamental

structural parameters, such as membrane thickness, area per lipid, and number of waters, even

under  above  conditions,  when  only  a  few  orders  of  diffraction  are  observed.  We  further

introduce a procedure, based on simple geometric relationships, to calculate the above named

parameters  directly  from  a  electron  density  model  of  the  bilayer,  without  the  need  of  extra

volumetric measurements.

of  the  electron  density  profile  r  along  the  z-axis.  The  structure  factor  accounts  for  the

crystalline or quasi-crystalline nature of the lattice of the bilayer stack in the liquid crystalline

phase.  Both,  structure  and  form  factor,  are  averaged  over  the  bilayer  fluctuations.  By

assuming  that  the  fluctuations  within  the  bilayer  are  independent  of  the  fluctuations  of  the

lattice points, the structure factor and the form factor can be treated separately according to

Debye [6]

The  last  term  in  Eq.  (3)  gives  rise  to  a  diffuse  scattering  and  is  usually  neglected,  when

structural information is derived from Bragg peaks only. The standard data analysis procedure

is  then  to  fit  the  Bragg  reflections  with  the  appropriate  structure  factor  multiplied  by  a

constant form factor for each single peak, which is a reasonable assumption in the vicinity of

the diffraction peaks only. The electron density profile relative to the constant electron density

of the buffer (water) is calculated by the Fourier synthesis

We invoke a model that tries to solve the problem in the backward direction by means of an

inverse  Fourier  transform.  Since  we  record  data  in  a  continuous  q-range,  we  should  rather

model the scattering function I(q) in the whole range studied. The electron density profile - at

a given resolution of 4 diffraction orders – can be modeled according to Wiener et al. [30] by

a summation of 2 Gaussians, each representing the polar headgroup and the methyl terminus 1,

quasi-molecular phospholipid fragments for oriented dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers at 66% RH. However,

this model is not applicable for the present case of the resolution limit of 4 and less diffraction orders.

Equation (7) gives the time averaged form factor of the bilayer as a continuous function of the

scattering vector q.

Since the structure factor retained from the Caillé theory considers the lattice disorder, a full

q-range description will also account for the diffuse scattering term in Eq. (3). We choose the

However, we discovered during our data analysis an additional diffuse scattering contribution,

which  is  not  described  by  the  MCT.  Its  origin  is  attributed  to  bilayers  with  strong  lattice

defects  or  unilamellar  vesicles,  which  display  neither  short-range  nor  (quasi)  long-range

order.  The  total  scattered  intensity  is  therefore  given  by  the  diffraction  of  the  phospholipid

multilayers within the quasi long-range order lattice, plus the additional diffuse scattering of

single, uncorrelated bilayers

We will refer in the further context of this article to the above described model as MCG, since

it is a combination of MCT and a Gaussian electron density representation of the  headgroup

[30].

A  further  benefit  of  this  method  is  that  one  can  derive  structural  parameters  from  simple

geometric  relationships,  without  the  need  of  volumetric  data  as,  e.g.,  in  the  approach  of

McIntosh and Simon [32], or Nagle et al. [14]. For determining the area per lipid, we follow

the formalism given by Lemmich et al. [33] by calculating the ratio

A. Sample preparation

1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-

phosphoethanolamine  (DPPE)  were  purchased  from  Avanti  Polar  Lipids,  Birmingham

Alabama,  and  used  without  further  purification.  Multilamellar  liposomes  were  prepared  by

dispersing  weighted  amounts  of  dry  lipids,  typically  20-30%  w/w,  in  bidistilled  water.  To

ensure complete hydration, the lipid dispersions were incubated for about 4 hours at least 10

°C  above  the  main  transition  temperature.  During  this  period  the  lipid  dispersions  were

vigorously vortexed. Aqueous dispersions of this lipids display narrow, cooperative melting

transitions within the limits of published values, thus proving that the lipid purity corresponds

to the claimed one of 99%. The POPC dispersions were further subjected to a centrifugation

(centrifuge:  3K18,  Sigma,  Germany  /  rotor:  12  x  1.5  (max.  2.2  ml)  /  time:  10  min  /  12000

rpm)  to  determine  the  content  of  unilamellar  vesicles  [35].  The  phospholipid  content  in  the

supernatant  was  assayed  by  an  enzymatic  kit  test  (Phospholipides  enzymatiques  PAP  150,

bioMérieux,  France).  A  proportion  of  0.1-0.2%  of  the  total  phospholipids  was  found  as

unilamellar vesicles in the supernatant. Thus, diffuse scattering from unilamellar vesicles can

be neglected.

Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were carried out at the SAXS beam-line,

ELETTRA [36, 37]. The diffraction patterns were recorded with a one-dimensional position

sensitive  detector  [38]  monitoring  the  q-range  between  2p /90  and  2p /10  Å-1  at  a  photon

energy  of  8  keV.  The  lipid  dispersions  were  kept  in  a  thin-walled  1  mm  diameter  Mark

capillary held in a steel cuvette, which provides good thermal contact to the Peltier heating

unit.  Exposure  times  were  typically  in  the  range  of  5  minutes.  Random  thin  layer

chromatography 

tests  for  radiation  damage  resulted  normal, 

i.e., 

they  showed  no

decomposition products. The position calibration of the detector was performed by using the

diffraction pattern of silver  behenate  powder  (CH3(CH2)20COOAg)  (repeat  unit  =  58.38  Å)

[39].

C. Data analysis

12

The X-ray data was analyzed in terms of the model developed in section II. After substracting

the  background  scattering  from  water  and  the  sample  cell,  we  applied  the  following

procedure. First, the Bragg reflections were fitted by  Lorentzians taking the square root of the

peak  area  as  an  estimate  for  the  constant  form  factor  of  each  peak.  Utilizing  Eq.  (4)  a  raw

electron density profile was calculated with the appropriate phases (- - + - -) [24, 32]. The

profile  was  then  fitted  with  the  electron  density  model  Eq.  (5),  taking  the  results  as  input

parameters  for  the  further  calculations.  Thereafter,  the  diffraction  pattern  was  fitted  in  the

complete q-range by operating Eq. (7) and (10), where the finite instrumental resolution has to

be accounted for by the convolution

where  the  standard  deviation  sr  is  typically  in  the  range  of  1.2  10-3  Å-1  for  the  given

experimental set-up. The number of fit parameters is 9 compared to 8 for the MCT model at 4

orders of diffraction [9]. Least square fitting was performed with self-written IDL (Interactive

Data Language) procedures, utilizing MPFIT [40], which is based on the MINPACK library

[41]. Structural parameters have been calculated according to Eqs. (14) – (19).

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We measured X-ray diffraction profiles from unoriented liposomal suspensions of POPC and

DPPE at 20 and 30% w/w lipid concentration, respectively. Both phospholipid samples were

measured in the lamellar liquid crystalline phase (smectic A); POPC was equilibrated at 2°C

and 50°C, DPPE at 75°C, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the diffraction pattern of POPC. Diffraction orders number 1, 2, 3, and 5 are

observed, the 4th  order  is  ruled  out  by  the  form  factor.  The  background  between  the  Bragg

reflections is clearly modulated by the bilayer form factor, most dominantly between the first

and third order. The solid line gives the best fit of the MCG model, developed in the theory

section (Eqs. (1), (7), (10), and (25)). The results for the fit parameters are given in the second

column  of  Table  I.  Note,  that  no  diffuse  background  is  fitted.  The  system  has  been

equilibrated at 2°C, only, and hence lattice defects are much more suppressed than at higher

temperatures,  where  molecular  motions  are  more  destructive  to  the  lattice  order.  Figure  2

depicts further the MCT fit (dashed line) within a q-range of ± 0.01 Å-1 around each Bragg

peak  (cf.  [14]);  a  close  view  of  the  first-order  peak  is  drawn  in  the  insert  to  Fig.  2.  The

comparison  demonstrates  two  facts:  First,  standard  MCT  uses  only  a  small  fraction  of  the

available diffraction data. Second, MCT gives a better fit for the peak tops, but a poorer fit for

the peak tails, as it applies a constant form factor within the fitted peak region. Neither of the

model functions perfectly describes the experimental data points. With the MCT method it is

apparently easier to model the scattered intensity in a limited regime around the Bragg peaks,

while  MCG  proved  to  be  better  suited  to  model  the  asymmetric  tails.  A  quantitative

comparison of the two models in terms of the respective, reduced c 2 sums is not expedient, as

different numbers of data points are being considered. It is more important to state that MCG

gives  a  qualitatively  good  fit  for  the  full  q-range,  i.e.,  the  diffraction  peaks  including  the

diffuse scattering, whereas MCT works in the vicinity of Bragg peaks only.

14

Figure  3  shows  the  differences  between  MCT  and  MCG  in  terms  of  the  electron  density

profiles. The Fourier synthesis for the MCT fit shows an anomalous, small hump at the center

of  the  water  layer,  due  to  truncation  errors.  The  MCG  model,  on  the  other  hand,  gives  a

smoother  representation  of  the  bilayer  profile,  since  it  excludes  by  definition  Fourier

truncation  errors  (Eq.  (5)).  However,  with  4  diffraction  orders  given,  both  profiles  yield

similar  structure  results.  Thus  full  advantage  of  MCG  can  be  taken  only  on  data  with  less

Bragg peaks.

At  50°C  the  scattered  intensity  of  POPC  exhibits  different  features  (Fig.  4).  Evidently,  the

number of clearly recognizable diffraction orders has decreased from 4 to 2, an effect which is

attributed to stronger thermal induced fluctuations of the bilayers, but not only. The position

of the 3rd order Bragg peak is close to a minimum of the bilayer form factor, therefore the 3rd

order is also attenuated because of the bilayer structure. Applying Fourier methods, such as

MCT, gives in this case only very rough structural information, as only 2 diffraction orders

can  be  used  to  construct  the  electron  density  profile  (cf.  insert  to  Fig.  4,  dashed  line).  The

MCG  model  (solid  line),  on  the  other  hand,  gives  a  clearly  refined  picture  of  the  bilayer,

which  affects  especially  the  headgroup  region,  whereas  the  terminating  methylene  group

remains strongly smeared. Further, one should expect a diffuse scattering from lattice defects,

as the temperature has increased from 2°C to 50°C. Indeed, we find a diffuse contribution of

the  bilayer  form  factor  (cf.  Table  I).  An  additional  fingerprint  for  enhanced  fluctuations  at

higher temperatures is the Caillé parameter h1, which is almost 2 times greater than at 2°C.

Compared to POPC, the diffraction pattern of DPPE (Fig. 5) exhibits a completely different

characteristic, regarding both, the number of observed Bragg peaks - here we detect the first 4

orders - as well as the diffuse background between the reflections. The solid line gives again

15

the best fit of the MCG model. The fit is in good agreement with the experimental data, the fit

results  are  given  in  Table  I.  The  model  fits  also  here  a  contribution  of  diffuse  scattering,

which  is  again  attributed  to  the  enhanced  molecular  motions  at  75°C.  The  insert  to  Fig.  5

illustrates  the  effect  of  the  MCG  on  Fourier  artifacts.  The  unreal  Fourier  ripples  of  the

Lorentzian model (dashed line), a consequence of the Fourier synthesis with 4 terms only, are

suppressed resulting in a smooth bilayer profile (solid line) that corresponds to the resolution

of the experiment.

Further structural parameters have been calculated according to the geometric considerations

expressed in Eqs. (14)-(19). The number of  headgroup  electrons  is  164  and  the  number  of

hydrocarbon chain electrons is 256 for POPC, whereas 

=e
Hn

140

 and 

=e
Cn

242

  for  DPPE,

respectively. The methylene electron density is 0.317 ± 0.003 e/Å3 according to Wiener et al.

[30]. The results for the two measured samples are listed in Tab. II. The structural parameters

of POPC at 2°C are compared to the values obtained by the volumetric method, which was

introduced by McIntosh and Simon [32, 42] for phospatidylethanolamines and further adopted

for  lecithins  by  Nagle  et  al.  [14].  A  brief  description  of  the  formalism  is  given  in  the

Appendix. For the lipid volume, which is an input parameter of the method, we refer to the

measurement of  Hianik  et  al.  [43]  and  extrapolate  to  2°C,  so  that  we  get 

l

LV   =  1223  Å3.

Within  measurement  errors,  which  are  larger  for  the  volumetric  method,  mostly  due  to

uncertainties in the  headgroup thickness [12, 13] both methods result in the same values for

the structural parameters (cf. column 1 & 2 of Tab. II). At 50°C, the repeat distance is reduced

by 2 Å, and the bilayer thickness by approx. 8 Å. On the other hand, the interbilayer water

thickness  is  increased  by  roughly  6  Å,  a  sign  for  water  uptake  from  the  excess  phase  as

observed in the increase of parameter  nW or 

*
Wn , respectively, due to reduced van  der Walls

interactions between opposing bilayers [44] at stronger undulations [45]. A further parameter,

16

which increases with temperature is the area per lipid. The structural results for DPPE, give a

very  thin  water  layer  of  10  water  molecules  per  lipid  molecule  out  of  which  approx.  6  are

intercalated into the bilayer. These values are in good agreement with the data published by

McIntosh  and  Simon  for  dilauroylphosphatidylethanolamine  (DLPE)  [32].  The  small  fluid

space in PE bilayers could arise from interbilayer hydrogen bond formation through the water

molecules or electrostatic interactions between the amine and phosphate groups of opposing

bilayers [32].

Finally, the electron density profiles were put on an absolute scale by applying Eqs. (20)-(24).

An input parameter is the total number of electrons per lipid molecule, which is 420 for POPC

and 382 for DPPE, respectively. The results are plotted in Fig. 6; Fig. 6 (a) and 6 (b) give the

absolute electron density of POPC at 2°C and 50°C, respectively, whereas Fig. 6 (c) depicts

the absolute electron density of DPPE at 75°C.

V. DISCUSSION

A  new  model  has  been  introduced  to  analyze  small  angle  diffraction  data  of  unoriented

phospholipid  membrane  stacks  at  high  instrumental  resolution.  The  formalism  combines  a

form factor, related to a Gaussian representation of the electron density profile (Fig.1), with a

MCT  structure  factor.  The  proposed  electron  density  model  gives  the  mean  structure  of  a

phospholipid bilayer time averaged over all fluctuations and is well suited to represent the X-

ray picture one sees from not more than 5 orders of diffraction. Higher orders - which can be

obtained by aligning the layers only - would result in a more detailed electron density profile

for which other electron density model, like ,e.g., hybrid types of Gaussians and strip-models

17

[34] would give a better representation. Such models have also been tried out on our data, but

were found to fail because of too many correlating fit parameters for the given instrumental

resolution.  It  is  reasonable  to  model  the  electron  density  profile  by  means  of  analytic

functions, as the features of its structure are well known since the pioneering work of Luzzati

and  Tardieu  [1,  2].  The  difference  in  the  distinct  phospholipid  bilayer  structures  are  then

accounted for by adjusting the parameters, i.e., headgroup position,  headgroup width, etc., of

the analytical function. The inverse Fourier method, which takes the form factor of the bilayer

model  and  fits  it  together  with  a  structure  factor  to  the  scattered  intensity  has  further  the

advantage  of  excluding  Fourier  truncation  errors.  The  MCG  model  has  been  tested

experimentally on POPC and DPPE  multilayers giving good fit results [see results section &

Fig. 2, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Tab. I].

Several other models have already been published [5, 6, 9, 10, 33], in order to perform the

same task. We shall briefly discuss the most prominent ones. In 1994, Nagle and coworkers

introduced the modified Caillé theory and gave an experimental proof of its superiority to the

classical  paracrystalline  theory  [9,  15].  The  group  usually  records  high-resolution  data  at  a

synchrotron  beam-line  by  means  of  a  diffractometer,  but  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Bragg

reflections  only.  Electron  density  profiles  are  computed  by  applying  the  standard  Fourier

synthesis  (Eq.  (4)).  In  contrary,  we  use  an  equivalently  brilliant  source,  but  a  detecting

system,  which  is  able  to  monitor  the  diffraction  pattern  in  a  continuous  range  of  scattering

angles. In this case, applying the standard MCT-data analysis, which works only in the regime

close  to  diffraction  peaks,  means  to  reject  all  the  information  hidden  in  the  diffuse

background  scattering  between  the  Bragg  peaks  (Fig.  2).  This  information  becomes  even

more  valuable  if  less  than  4  orders  are  observed.  Nagle  and  coworkers  report  only  two

diffraction 

orders 

for 

unoriented 

dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 

(DPPC), 

egg

18

phosphatidylcholine 

(EPC),  dimyristolphosphatidylcholine 

(DMPC), 

and  dioleoyl-

phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers in excess water [14 - 17], which is insufficient to obtain

satisfactory  structural  information,  if  only  the  Bragg  peaks  are  considered.  The  common

circumvention  of  this  problem  are  osmotic  stress  experiments  [14-21,  23,  24],  where  the

system  is  partly  dehydrated,  and  thus  more  diffraction  orders  are  detected  as  bilayers  are

consequently  hindered  in  undulation.  Structural  information  of  the  fully  hydrated  phase  is

accessible  then  only  through  a  numerical  extrapolation  to  zero  osmotic  pressure.  It  is  well

known that extrapolations are always inherent to large uncertainties and should be avoided if

possible. The MCG model, on the other hand, describes also the diffuse scattering and is thus

capable of obtaining structural information even at low Bragg reflection information content,

e.g.,  POPC  at  50°C  (Fig.  4).  Moreover,  the  assumption  of  a  constant  form  factor  for  each

Bragg peak is not very accurate for higher diffracting orders, as peaks broaden strongly and

more and more scattered intensity is smeared to the peak tails. For instance, the third order

peak  of  the  2°C-POPC  diffraction  pattern  displays  an  asymmetric  shape  (Fig.  2),  which  is

obviously due to the modulation by a non-constant bilayer form factor. Such effects are not

seen  in  the  X-ray  data  published  by  Nagle  and  coworkers,  because  the  observation  of

asymmetric peak shapes is likely to depend on the lipid type and on its specific form factor,

e.g., the diffraction pattern of DPPE does not exhibit any asymmetric peaks (Fig. 4). Further,

data  treated  with  MCT  only,  has  not  always  been  presented  in  a  uniform  fashion,  i.e.,  with

increasing order (h = 1 to 3) decreases the data point density [16, 17] or the selected q-range

[15]. Thus, peak asymmetries, even if present are difficult to be seen.

Nallet et al. [10] suggested a model similar to MCT [9] to analyze small angle scattering data

on  bis  2-ethylhexyl  sodium  sulphosuccinate  (AOT)  and  didodecyl  dimethyl  ammonium

bromide (DDAB) / water systems. They combined the structure factor with the form factor of

19

a  strip  model  for  a  continuous  q-range  fit  function.  Although  the  strip  model  for  the

AOT/water  and  DDAB/water  systems  differs  somewhat  from  a  reasonable  strip  model  for

phospholipid bilayers, this method could in principle easily be adopted with the advantage of

less  fit  parameters.  Still  we  refer  to  the  common  criticism  on  strip  models,  which  is  that

discontinuous  boundaries  between  the  different  regions  of  the  bilayers  are  an  unrealistic

picture of a fluctuating bilayer.

A  quite  different  approach  was  introduced  by  Lemmich  et  al.  [33]  for  neutron  scattering

experiments. He proposed a strip model for the bilayer, but averaged its form factor together

with  a  paracrystalline  structure  factor  without  decoupling  the  two  entities  as  the  two  other

theories  do  (Eqs.  (1)  and  (3)).  Lemmich  analyzed  his  data  in  terms  of  both,  his  model  and

MCT, but the fits gave equally good results for phospholipids in the lamellar liquid crystalline

phase. The most convincing explanation is that the strong instrumental smearing, inherent to

neutron  scattering  experiments,  does  not  allow  for  any  decision.  Since  not  even  Lemmich

could show better fit results for phospholipids in the La -phase, we see no argument to apply

his model which would imply a recalculation of the whole formalism, since X-rays "see" a

different contrast than neutrons do.

Concluding the last paragraph, we should state that the models that have been discussed are

without  any  doubts  appropriate  for  the  measurement  methods  applied  by  the  individual

groups. This is clearly demonstrated by the good fits to their experimental data. However, for

the given reasons our method is best tailored to extract as much information as possible from

high resolution X-ray data recorded in a continuous range.

20

A further benefit of MCG is that structural parameters like bilayer thickness, area per lipid,

water  distribution,  etc.,  can  be  estimated  from  simple  geometric  considerations.  Despite  the

gravimetric  method  of  Luzzati  [1],  the  commonly  used  method,  initiated  by  McIntosh  and

Simon [32, 42] and applied by Nagle et al. [14], relies on additional information of the lipid

volume,  which  is  supplied  by  specific  volumetric  measurements.  The  algorithm  is  build  up

upon  a  comparison  with  a  known  gel  phase  structure,  assuming  that  the  volume  of  the

headgroup is the same for both phases (cf. Appendix, Eq. (A1), (A2)). For phospholipids with

a PC headgroup one usually employs the structural data of DPPC in the  Lb ‘-phase, published

by Sun et. al [46, 47]. A further structural input, i.e., the  headgroup  thickness,  is  needed  to

calculate the bilayer thickness according to the steric definition [42] (Eq. (A4)). McIntosh and

Simon suggested a value of 10 Å for PC  headgroups and 8 Å for PE’s, derived from space

filling molecular models. The  headgroup conformation of DPPC has been measured by  Büldt

et  al.  [48,  49],  by  means  of  neutron  diffraction  and  deuteron  labels,  but  at  very  low  water

content (10 & 25 % w/w). From the published data the heagroup thickness can be extracted as

dH = 9 ± 1.2 Å, a value which is employed by Nagle and coworkers, without considering the

measurement error within which the values given by McIntosh and Büldt are equal. However,

the headgroup  conformation  is  likely  to  depend  on  temperature,  pressure,  chain  tilt  [30]  or

hydration [24], which directly affects the headgroup dimensions, so that the volume of the PC

headgroup in the  Lb ’-phase  is  not  evidently  the  same  as  in  the  La -phase.  Hence,  a  method

which utilizes the assumption of constant  headgroup volume and size, respectively, and even

relies on measurements on systems different from the situation of fully hydrated bilayers, can

be justifiable but certainly leads to a rough estimate. A way out of this dilemma should be

structural data from highly aligned  multilayers  at  full  hydration  according  to  the  method  of

Katsaras et al. [28]. However, it is possible to obtain also reasonable estimates for unoriented

systems  without  the  need  of  extra  data  input  by  the  simple  geometric  relationships  of  the

21

Gaussian electron density model (Eqs. (14)-(19)). The results compare well to those obtained

by the volumetric method (cf. Table II) and even display smaller errors.

The Gaussian electron density profile can be set on an absolute scale, which is often desirable.

The scaling factor is computed by integrating the profile from the center to the border of the

unit cell (Eq. (20)). This can be easily done, since the electron density profile is given as an

analytic function. However, we argue to take absolute electron densities with great care, since

the relative error of the scaling factor is large (0.2 for POPC at 50°C), a consequence of the

large number of error contributors in the calculation procedure. This implies also to absolute

electron densities published by other groups [14-17, 30], but has not been discussed there.

In conclusion, we remark that the MCG model gives considerable more structural information

than standard MCT, provided that the number of recorded diffraction orders is less than 4. At

4 orders of diffraction one obtains equally good results (Fig. 3). The advantages of the model

are  due  to  a  cancellation  of  Fourier  artifacts,  and  a  simple  method  to  derive  structural

parameters. Since the model can retrieve structural information from the diffuse scattering its

potential increases in importance, when less than four orders of diffraction are recorded (Fig.

4). This is a common situation for fully hydrated phosphaditylcholine bilayers, which include

about 3 times more interbilayer water than phosphaditylethanolamine bilayer systems.

FIG.  1.  The  Gaussian  electron  density  profile  representation  of  a  phospholipid  bilayer

corresponding to a X-ray resolution of 4 Bragg peaks.

FIG. 2. The best fit of the MCG model (solid line) and MCT (dashed line within marked peak

region) to the diffraction pattern of POPC at 2°C. The insert gives a zoom of the first order

Bragg peak.

FIG. 3. Comparison of the electron density profile for POPC bilayers at 2°C obtained by a

Fourier synthesis (dashed line), using MCT and the MCG refined profile (solid line).

FIG. 4. The best fit of the MCG model (solid line) to the diffraction pattern of POPC at 50°C.

The  insert  gives  the  electron  density  profile  obtained  by  a  Fourier  synthesis  (dashed  line),

using Lorentzians to fit the Bragg peaks, and the profile refined with MCG (solid line).

FIG. 5. The best fit of the MCG model (solid line) to the diffraction pattern of DPPE at 75°C.

The  insert  gives  the  electron  density  profile  obtained  by  a  Fourier  synthesis  (dashed  line),

using Lorentzians to fit the Bragg peaks, and the profile refined with MCG (solid line).

FIG. 6. Absolute electron density profiles of POPC at 2°C (a), POPC at 50°C (b), and DPPE

at 75°C (c). Deviations due to the error of the instrumental scaling factor a are depicted as a

gray  area  enveloped  by  the  maximal  positive  (dashed  line)  and  negative  (dot-dashed  line)

divergence.

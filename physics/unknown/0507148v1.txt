We present the theoretical and detailed experimental characterizations of Photothermal 

Heterodyne Imaging.  An analytical expression of the photothermal heterodyne signal is 

derived using the theory of light scattering from a fluctuating medium. The amplitudes 

of the signals detected in the backward and forward configurations are compared and 

their  frequency  dependences  are  studied.  The  application  of  the  Photothermal 

Heterodyne  detection  technique  to  the  absorption  spectroscopy  of  individual  gold 

nanoparticles is discussed and the detection of small individual silver nanoparticles is 

demonstrated.  

  

I Introduction 

 
Several optical schemes have been used to perform the detection of nano-objects at the single 

entity  level.  Together  with  constant  improvements  in  synthesis  and  characterization  of 

nanosized  materials,  those  highly  sensitive  methods  make  possible  the  development  of  new 

nano-components such as plasmonic devices[1, 2] or single photon sources [3]. Until recently 

most  optical  detection  methods  of  single  nanometer  sized-objects  were  based  on 

luminescence.  Single  fluorescent  molecules  or  semiconductor  nanocrystals  have  been 

extensively  studied  and  are  now  widely  implemented  in  various  research  domains  ranging 

from quantum optics[4] to life science[5]. However, luminescence based techniques suffer for 

some shortcomings, mainly associated with the photostability of the luminescent nano-object 

itself.  Concurrently,  for  relatively  large  nanoparticles,  Rayleigh  scattering  based  methods 

have  recently  demonstrated  a  great  applicability,  especially  for  single  metal  nanoparticles 

(NPs)  spectroscopy[6,  7]  or  biomolecules  imaging[8].  However,  as  the  scattering  cross-

sections  of  the  particles  decrease  with  the  sixth  power  of  the  diameter,  these  methods  are 

limited to the study of rather large NPs (diameter > 20 nm). 

Since  the  absorption  cross-section  of  these  NPs  scales  with  the  volume,  an  interesting 

alternative to Rayleigh-scattering relies solely on absorption properties. Indeed, excited near 

their plasmon resonance, metal NPs have a relatively large absorption cross section (~6×10P

-

P cmP

P for a 5 nm diameter gold NP) and exhibit a fast electron-phonon relaxation time in the 

picosecond  range[9],  which  makes  them  very  efficient  light  absorbers.  Luminescence  from 

these particles being extremely weak, almost all the absorbed energy is converted into heat. 

The increase of temperature induced by this absorption gives rise to a local variation of the 

refraction index. This photothermal effect was first used to detect gold NPs as small as 5 nm 

in diameter by a Photothermal Interference Contrast (PIC) method[10]. In that case, the signal 

was  caused  by  the  phase-shift  between  the  two  orthogonally  polarized,  spatially-separated 

beams  of  an  interferometer,  only  one  of  which  propagating  through  the  heated  region.  The 

sensitivity of this technique, though high, is limited. In particular, when high NA objectives 

are used, depolarization effects degrade the quality of the overlap between the two arms of the 

interferometer.  

We  recently  developed  another  photothermal  method,  called  Photothermal  Heterodyne 

Imaging  (PHI)[11].  It  uses  a  combination  of  a  time-modulated  heating  beam  and  a  non-

resonant  probe  beam.  The  probe  beam  produces  a  frequency  shifted  scattered  field  as  it 

interacts with the time modulated variations of the refractive index around the absorbing NP. 

The scattered field is then detected through its beatnote with the probe field which plays the 

role  of  a  local  oscillator  as  in  any  heterodyne  technique.  This  signal  is  extracted  by  lock-in 

detection. The sensitivity of PHI lies two orders of magnitude above earlier methods[10] and 

it allowed for the unprecedented detection of individual 1.4 nm (67 atoms) gold NPs, as well 

as  CdSe/ZnS  semiconductor  nanocrystals.  In  addition,  since  the  PHI  signal  is  directly 

proportional to the power absorbed by the nano-object, this method could be used to perform 

absorption spectroscopy studies of individual gold NPs down to diameters of 5 nm[12] 

The goal of this paper is to give the theoretical framework of the PHI method and to compare 

the expected signals with the experimental results. In the following section, after a qualitative 

description of the principle of the PHI method, we will present an analytical derivation of the 

PHI signal. For this purpose the theory of light scattering by a fluctuating dielectric medium is 

used. The experimental study of the PHI signal is presented in Section III. Its variations with 

the modulation frequency are detailed both theoretically and experimentally in section IV. In 

section  V,  we  present  the  results  of  the  implementation  of  PHI  spectroscopy  of  individual 

gold  NPs  followed  by  preliminary  results  obtained  with  silver  NPs.  In  the  last  section,  we 

briefly discuss further implementations of PHI.   

II Theoretical model for the PHI signal 

 

Throughout this article, we consider an absorbing nanosphere with radius a much smaller than 

the  optical  wavelengths  embedded  in  a  homogeneous  medium  whose  thermal  diffusivity  is 

D κ=

C

  (with κ  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  medium  and  C  its  heat  capacity  per  unit 

volume).  When  illuminated  with  an  intensity  modulated  laser  beam  with  average  intensity

the temperature rise can be derived using the heat point source model for heat diffusion[13]:

The geometry of the problem is represented in Figure 1. A focused circularly polarized probe 

beam  interacts  with  the  time  modulated  susceptibility  profile.  At  the  beam  waist,  a  plane 

wave-front is considered. Thus, the incident probe field can be written

In  practice,  rBthB  is  smaller  than  the  probe  beam’s  wavelength  (see  below).  Hence,  a  full 

electromagnetic derivation of the scattering field is necessary to further evaluate the detected 

signal.  We  used  the  model  introduced  by  Lastovka[14]  as  a  starting  point  for  our

III Experimental results and characterization of the signals 

In the following, the experimental details will be given. A schematic of the setup is presented 

in  Figure  2.  A  non  resonant  probe  beam  (632.8  nm,  HeNe,  or  single  frequency  Ti:Sa  laser) 

and an absorbed  heating beam (532 nm, frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser or tunable cw dye 

laser) are overlaid and focused on the sample by means of a high NA microscope objective 

(100x,  NA=1.4).  The  intensity  of  the  heating  beam  is  modulated  at  Ω   by  an  acousto-optic 

modulator.  

As mentioned previously, the PHI signal can be detected using two different configurations. 

In the case of the detection of the backward signal, a combination of a polarizing cube and a 

quarter  wave  plate  is  used  to  extract  the  interfering  probe-reflected  and  backward-scattered 

fields. In order to detect the forward signal, a second microscope objective (80x, NA=0.8) is 

employed to efficiently collect the interfering probe-transmitted and forward-scattered fields. 

The 

intensity  of 

the  heating  beam  sent  on 

the  NPs

to

 (depending on the desired signal-to-noise ratio and the NP size to

be imaged). Backward or forward interfering fields are collected on fast photodiodes and fed 

into a lock-in amplifier in order to extract the beat signal at Ω. Integration time of 10 ms are 

typically used. Images are formed by moving the sample over the fixed laser spots by means 

of a 2D piezo-scanner. The size distributions of the gold NPs were checked by transmission 

electron  microscopy  (data  not  shown)  and  are  in  agreement  with  the  manufacturer's 

specification (typically, 10% dispersion in size). The samples were prepared by spin-coating a 

solution  of  gold  NPs  diluted  into  a  polyvinyl-alcohol  matrix,  (~1%  mass  PVA)  onto  clean 

microscope  cover  slips.  The  dilution  and  spinning  speed  were  chosen  such  that  the  final 

density of NPs in the sample was less than 1 µmP

P. Application of silicon oil on the sample 

-2

insures homogeneity of the heat diffusion. The index of refraction of that fluid and its thermal 

conductivity  are  close  to  those  of  common  glasses.  Thus,  there  is  no  sharp  discontinuity 

neither  for  the  thermal  parameters  nor  for  the  refractive  indices  at  the  glass-silicon  oil 

interface and we can consider that the NPs are embedded in a homogeneous medium. 

Figure 3 shows a two dimensional PHI image of individual 10 nm gold NPs corresponding to 

the backward (Fig. 3a) and forward (Fig. 3b) signals. Both images show no background signal 

from  the  substrate,  indicating  that  the  signal  arises  from  the  only  absorbing  objects  in  the 

sample, namely the gold aggregates. In both cases the heating intensities were the same (~500 

P)  and  the  NPs  are  detected  with  high  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  greater  than  one 

2
kW/cmP

hundred. 

According  to  Eq.  (14),  the  resolution  of  the  PHI  method  depends  on  the  probe  and  heating 

beam  profiles  and  also  on  the  dielectric  susceptibility  profile.  Since  the  spatial  extension  of 

the latter is much smaller than the size of the probe beam, the transverse resolution is simply 

given  by  the  product  of  the  two  beams  profiles.  In  figure  4,  we  study  the  resolution  by 

imaging a single gold NP with two sets of beam sizes. In the first case, we used low aperture 

beams with Gaussian profiles measured at the objective focal plane (Fig. 4(a)). In the second 

case, higher aperture beams are used and their profiles contain diffraction rings arising from 

the  limited  aperture  of  the  microscope  objective  (Fig.  4(b)).  In  both  cases,  the  transverse 

profile  of  the  PHI  signal  is  in  very  good  agreement  with  the  product  of  the  two  beams 

profiles.  In  the  first  case  (Fig.4(a)),  the  full-width-at-half-maximum  (FWHM)  of  the  PHI 

profile  is  equal  to  365  ±  5nm  and  reduces  to    235  ±  5nm  in  the  second  case  (Fig.4(b)),  in 

accordance with the products of the beams profiles which are respectively equal to 360 ± 5nm 

(FWHM) and 213 ± 5nm (FWHM). 

 The linearity of the PHI signals with respect to IBheatB was checked on individual 10 nm gold 
NPs (see Fig. 5(a)). Even at high intensities  (

saturation  behavior,  rather  it  is  accompanied  by  fluctuations  in  the  signal  amplitude  and 

eventually  irreversible  damage  on  the  particle[17,  18].We  further  confirmed  that  the  peaks 

stem  from  single  particles  by  generating  the  histogram  of  the  signal  height  for  321  imaged 

peaks (see Fig. 5(b)). We find a monomodal distribution with a dispersion of 30 % around the 

mean  signal.  At  a  given  heating  wavelength heatλ ,  the  PHI  signal  is  proportional  to  the 

absorption  cross-section σ.  According  to  the  dipolar  approximation  of  Mie  theory[19],  for 

small  metallic  NP  with  radius 

a

  it  scales  as  the  NP’s  volume.  Therefore,  our 

λ
heat

π

measurements  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  spread  of  10  %  in  particle  size  as  evaluated 

with  TEM  measurements.  The  unimodal  distribution  of  the  signal  values  and  its  dispersion 

confirm  that  individual  NPs  are  imaged.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3,  PHI  allows  for  imaging  small 

gold NPs in both configurations with unprecedented SNR. Owing to this great sensitivity it is 

possible  to  detect  by  optical  means  and  in  a  far-field  configuration  gold  NPs  with  diameter 

2
down to 1.4 nm at moderate intensities (~ 5 MW/cmP

P) and with a SNR > 10 [11]. 

 To clearly demonstrate the linearity of the PHI signals with respect to the volume of the NPs, 

the  size  dependence  of  the  absorption  cross  section  of  gold  NPs  (at  532  nm,  close  to  the 

maximum  of  the  SPR)  was  studied  for  NP  diameters  ranging  from  1.4  nm  to  75  nm.  As 

expected,  a  good  agreement  with  a  third-order  law  of  the  absorption  cross-section  vs  the 

radius of the particles was found[11]. 

IV Frequency dependence 

We will now compare the amplitude of PHI backward and forward signals and discuss their 

dependences with respect to the modulation frequency.

Two main features can be seen from Figure 6: first, and as expected in any thermal process, 

the PHI signals exhibit a low-pass behaviour. Second, a clear difference between the forward 

and  the  backward  normalized  signal  magnitudes  is  found  at  low  frequencies,  whereas  both 

signals decrease identically in the high frequency domain. Qualitatively, one can understand 

these  features  by  considering  the  susceptibility  profile  as  a  scattering  object  with  a 

characteristic size  thr .  

We  introduce  the  size  parameter

On  the  one  hand,  for  high  frequencies  (

CΩ>>Ω

)  when  the  scattering  object  is  small 

compared  to  the  incident  probe  beam  wavelength  (

1<<ξ

),  the  angular  distribution  of  the 

scattered light is symmetric with respect to the focal plane[20] leading to identical backward 

and  forward  PHI  signals.  Furthermore,  the  in-phase  components

On the other hand, for low frequencies (

so that forward scattering becomes significantly more efficient than backward scattering[20],

Fig. 6 (a-b) also present experimental data points from measurements performed on a single 

10 nm gold NP. The modulation frequency ranged from 100 kHz to 15 MHz. As mentioned 

above,  experimental  data  were  adjusted  by  the  model  resulting  from  Eq.(14)  with  D  as  the 

only adjustable parameter. For both configurations, limitations of the collection efficiency by 

the objective lenses were neglected. A good quantitative agreement between the experimental

  in  both  configurations.  This  value  is  in  good  agreement  with  the 

technical specifications of the embedding medium. We also reported the values of the typical 

sizes of the scattering objects rBthB mentioned above and reported them on the top axis of Fig. 6 

(a-b).  

To further test our theoretical description of the PHI signals, Eq. (14) can be used to estimate 

numerically  the  PHI  power  detected  at  the  detector  in  both  configurations.  A  single  10  nm

  in  the  backward  and  forward  directions  (mean  of  80  signals  from  different

experimental  results.  The  discrepancy  is  certainly  due  to  the  assumption  of  a  spherical 

reference wave in the calculation of the beatnote power. This optimal case is not reached in 

our experiments even with high NA microscope objectives.  

In  any  case,  the  forward  PHI  signal  is  significantly  larger  than  the  backward  one,  due  to  a 

more efficient heterodyne amplification in the forward direction (

). Experimentally, 

shot  noise  limited  detection  is  difficult  to  obtain  for  low  frequencies,  and  it  is  only  in  the

is obtained. Nevertheless the excess noise was low enough to obtain close-to-optimal SNR in 

the backward detection scheme (see Fig.3). 

 

V Absorption spectroscopy of individual metallic NPs 

 

PHI not only allows for highly sensitive detection of gold NPs but also opens new pathways 

towards absorption spectroscopy of single metallic NP and more generally of non-luminescent 

nano-objects.  Several  theoretical  models  predicted  the  existence  of  so-called  intrinsic  size 

B
effects  in  the  optical  response  of  metallic  NPs  with  sizes  significantly  smaller  than  the 

electron mean free path[19, 21]. Limitation of the electron mean free path as well as chemical 

interface  damping[19,  22]  increase  the  damping  rate  of  the  Surface  Plasmon  Resonance 

(SPR), thus leading in the time domain to shorter dephasing times (down to a few fs). Because 

of such intrinsic size effects, the dielectric constant of the NPs differs from that of the bulk 

value and must include an additional surface damping contribution. Experimental studies on 

ensembles  of  metallic  NPs  revealed  the  existence  of  such  effects  [19,  23].  However  a 

quantitative description of those effects was made difficult mostly because of inhomogeneous 

broadening. In order to overcome this shortcoming, PHI was used to record absorption spectra 

of individual gold NPs with diameters down to 5 nm[12]. Figure 7 represents the absorption 

spectra of 2 single gold NPs with diameters of 33 nm and 5 nm respectively, performed in the 

wavelength  range  515-580  nm  (i.e.  photon  energy  range  2.41-2.14  eV).  The  values  of  peak 

resonance  energies  are  not  particularly  affected  by  intrinsic  size  effects.  On  the  contrary,  a 

significant increase in width of the resonance Γ is clearly visible that cannot be described by 

Mie theory using the bulk values of the gold dielectric constant. We found a good agreement 

between  the  experimental  widths  and  Mie  simulations  by  introducing  the  size  dependent 

correction to the bulk dielectric constant that accounts for the presence of intrinsic size effects 

in  the  absorption  spectra  of  small  gold  NPs[12].  Although  the  existence  of  intrinsic  size 

effects in the optical response of gold NPs was unambiguously revealed, part of the damping 

processes are due to interband transition, which makes it difficult to connect the widths of the 

Plasmon resonances to the damping rate. Indeed, for gold, the energy threshold for interband 

transitions lies at ~2.4 eVB   Band is preceded by an absorption tail starting at about 1.8 eV [24]. 

Consequently, the SPR spectra are asymmetric and defining a full-width-at-half maximum of 

absorption  spectra  for  gold  NPs  is  delicate,  and  even  impossible  for  very  small  particles.  A 

way  to  circumvent  this  additional  damping  would  consist  in  red-shiftingB  Bresonant  energies 

towards photon energy smaller than the onset of interband transition. This can be done either 

by  embedding  spherical  gold  NPs  in  a  matrix  with  high  refractive  index  or  by  studying  the 

SPR of the long axis mode in gold nanorods [6, 25] or even by using core-shell NP[26]. 

Another possibility consists in using spherical silver NPs instead of gold NPs[27]. Indeed for 

silver,  the  resonant  energy  of  spherical  NPs  embedded  in  a  medium  with  refractive  index 

5.1=n

 is  at ~3 eV, whereas interband transitions start at  ~3.7 eV[24]. Thus silver NPs are 

well adapted for studying the size dependence of ultrafast dephasing of the SPR at the single 

particle  level.  A  limitation  of  silver  NP  is  however  their  weak  photostability  due  to  photo-

oxydation[28].  This  limitation  can  be  surpassed  by  using  encapsulated  silver  NPs[29]  e.g. 

with PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)) [30] . Figure 8(a) shows a three dimensional representation 

of PHI image of individual PEG-coated silver NPs with average diameter of 5.3 nm. For this 

image, a modulated diode laser (Coherent Compass) emitting at 405 nm was used as heating 

laser  with  heating  intensity  of  only 

50~

kW

2

cm

.  As  expected,  we  found  that  the  SNR 

obtained with silver NPs is about 10 times higher than that of gold NPs of the same size, when 

identical heating intensities are used to excite the NPs at the peak of their SPR resonance. The 

PHI signal measured on PEG-coated silver NPs was stable during more than one minute (see 

Fig.  8(b)).  For  those  silver  nanoparticles,  the  size  distribution  checked  by  TEM  (data  not 

shown)  was  poor:  20%.  This  translates  in  an  dispersion  of  90%  in  the  distribution  of  the 

measured PHI signals (653 imaged peaks (see Fig. 8(b)). For such experiments, sensitivity at 

the  single  particle  level  is  all  the  more  necessary  as  the  heterogeneity  in  size  and  shape  is 

obviously  larger  for  silver  NPs  than  for  gold  NPs.  In  addition,  expected  progresses  in  the 

synthesis of silver NPs such that narrower size distributions NPs can be obtain should permit 

a quantitative study of the SPR of individual silver NPs much smaller than 5 nm in diameter.  

 

VI. Conclusion and Perspectives  

 
In  conclusion,  we  have  presented  the  theoretical  and  experimental  characterizations  of  the 

Photothermal Heterodyne Imaging technique which allows for the detection of individual non 

fluorescent nano-objects such as metallic nanoparticles (gold or silver) or even semiconductor 

nanocrystals[11]. The photothermal heterodyne signal was derived through a model based on 

classical  scattering  theory.  Experiments  on  individual  gold  nanoparticles  provided  results  in 

good  agreement  with  our  calculations.  Photothermal  Heterodyne  Imaging,  which  is  not 

limited  by  most  shortcomings  of  fluorescence  microscopy  such  as  scattering  background  or 

photobleaching allows for long observation times with high signal to noise ratios. 

The high sensitivity provided by PHI, coupled to a better control of the NPs synthesis should 

allow original studies of light-NP interaction processes and we foresee diverse applications in 

different fields such as in plasmonics or bioimaging. For instance, gold NPs have been used as 

labels for biological applications [8, 31]. In this context, PHI is potentially the most sensitive 

method  to  detect  gold  NPs  in  live  cells  by  optical  means.  For  such  applications,  the  local 

increase of temperature in the vicinity of the NP must not perturb the biological function of 

the specimens under study. Since the thermal conductivity of metals is much higher than that 

of  the  surrounding  medium,  the  temperature  inside  a  spherical  NP  can  be  considered  as 

uniform and equal to the temperature at its surface. This temperature writes: 

P
abs
T
=

a

 and 

decreases as the inverse of the distance from the NP surface. For 5 nm gold NPs in aqueous 

2 
medium,  a  heating  intensity  of  500  kW/cmP

Pleads  to  a  surface  temperature  of  ~  1.5  K, 

sufficiently low for live cell integrities.

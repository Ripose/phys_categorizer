Abstract 

We  report  the  first  ultrafast  pulse  radiolysis  transient  absorption  spectroscopy 

measurements  from  the  Terawatt  Ultrafast  High  Field  Facility  (TUHFF)  at  Argonne 

National Laboratory. TUHFF houses a 20 TW Ti:sapphire laser system that generates 2.5 

nC  sub-picosecond  pulses  of  multi-MeV  electrons  at  10  Hz  using  laser  wakefield 

acceleration.  The  system  has  been  specifically  optimized  for  kinetic  measurements  in  a 

pump-probe fashion. This requires averaging over many shots which  necessitates stable, 

reliable generation of electron pulses.  The latter were used to generate excess electrons 

in  pulse  radiolysis  of  liquid  water  and  concentrated  solutions  of  perchloric  acid.  The 

hydronium ions in the acidic solutions react with the hydrated electrons resulting in the 

rapid  decay  of  the  transient  absorbance  at  800  nm  on  the  picosecond  time  scale.  Time 

resolution  of  a  few  picoseconds  has  been  demonstrated.    The  current  time  resolution  is 

determined  primarily  by  the  physical  dimensions  of  the  sample  and  the  detection 

sensitivity.    Subpicosecond  time  resolution  can  be  achieved  by  using  thinner  samples, 

more sensitive detection techniques and improved electron beam quality.

I. INTRODUCTION 

One  of  the  most  common  yet  still  poorly  understood  sources  for  chemical 

activation  energy  in  the  Universe  is  ionizing  radiation.  Radiation  chemists  study  the 

rapid,  energetic  reactions  that  are  initiated  by  the  interaction  of  the  ionizing  radiation, 

such  as  high  energy  electrons,  with  matter.  Understanding  of  these  reactions  impacts 

many  fields  including  the  design  of  nuclear  reactors,  radioactive  waste  management, 
radiation therapy, polymer processing, and planetary- and astro- physics.1  

As  highly  ionizing  radiation  passes  through  the  condensed  phase,  energy  is 

occasionally  deposited  along  the  trajectory  which  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the 

radiolytic  track.    The  points  at  which  the  relativistic  electrons  interact  with  condensed 

matter result in the formation of radiolytic spurs, viz. tight clusters of excited and ionized 

molecules.  For 1-10 MeV electrons in water, the spurs are  5-10 nm in diameter and are 
separated by 200-400 nm along the track.2  The rapid physical and chemical events that 

take  place  in  the  radiolytic  spur  occur  on  the  picosecond  and  shorter  time  scales.  

Detailed knowledge of fundamental spur processes, such as thermalization, solvation, and 

the reactions of short-lived energetic species (excited states and ions), is critical in order 
to  develop  an  understanding  of  the  mechanism(s)  for  radiation  damage.1,3,4  Quite  often 

these  intraspur  reactions  involve  exotic  excited  states  and  cross-reactions  between 
ionized/excited  molecules.5-7  Generation  of  such  otherwise  hard-to-access  states,  the 

unusual  reaction  regimes,  and  the  inherently  non-uniform  deposition  of  the  primary 

ionization/excitation events make it difficult if not impossible to simulate rapid radiolytic 
processes  using  ultrafast  laser  sources.8-14  Studies  of  the  fundamental  processes  of 

radiation induced reactions require an ultrafast source of ionizing radiation. Furthermore, 

this source must be  accurately synchronized to  an ultrafast laser that is used as a probe 

source for the detection of the short-lived species and their kinetics. 

For  the  past  thirty  years  the  most  common  source  of  ionizing  radiation  used  for 

subnanosecond  pulse  radiolysis  studies  has  been  radio  frequency  (RF)  linear  electron 
accelerators  (linacs)  based  on  thermionic  guns.15-19    The  time  resolution  of  transient 

absorption  pulse  radiolysis  experiments  using  this  type  of  linac  has,  for  the  most  part, 

3. 

been limited to 20-30 ps at 10-100 Hz.20 Time resolution of about 5 ps has been realized 
for emission measurements using a streak camera for detection.21  Recently, new types of 

electron  accelerators  based  on  laser-driven  photocathode  linacs  have  been  specifically 
developed  for  radiation  chemistry.22-27  At  Osaka  University  scientists  have  produced 

single  electron  bunches  that  are  less  than  100  fs  in  duration  (at  32  MeV)  using  a 
photocathode  linac.24,28    Despite  the  ultrashort  bunch  lengths  produced  with  this  new 

generation  of  accelerators  the  best  time  resolution  attainable  for  transient  absorption 
pulse radiolysis experiments is typically 4-10 ps.26,29-31  This is primarily due to detection 

sensitivity  and  timing  jitter  between  the  laser  and  accelerator.    However,  the  improved 

time  resolution  that  photocathode  based  accelerators  offer  over  thermionic  linacs  has 

opened  up  the  door  for  new  areas  of  chemical  research.    Recent  picosecond  pulse 

radiolysis  experiments  that  take  advantage  of  the  new  time  window  include  a  re-
evaluation  of  the  initial  radiolytic  yield  of  the  hydrated  electron  in  water,30  ultrafast 
studies  of  quantum  confinement  in  semiconducting  scintillators,32    fast  charge  transfer 
mechanisms,33 radiolytic reactions31,34,35 and radiolysis of supercritical liquids.36,37  

For  photocathode  linacs,  the  experimental  time  resolution  is  highly  dependent 

upon the degree of synchronization between the phase of the RF field and the laser pulse 

that  generates  the  photoelectrons  at  the  photocathode  as  well  as  the  synchronization 

between the resulting electron pulse and the probe laser pulse. For example, to generate 

an 800 fs electron pulse, the time jitter between the RF and the laser must be reduced to 
better than 500 fs.38  This level of stability is difficult to reliably achieve in practice and is 

one  of  the  factors  limiting  the  usefulness  of  this  approach  for  ultrafast  pulse  radiolysis 

studies. 

At  Argonne  National  Laboratory,  a  different  approach  that  capitalizes  on  recent 

advances  in  laser  wakefield  acceleration  has  been  pursued.  Since  the  advent  of  chirped 
pulse  amplification39  significant  advances  have  been  made  in  ultrafast  high  power 
femtosecond  laser  technology.    Ti:Sapphire  based  table-top  terawatt  (T3)  laser  systems 
are  now  routinely  capable  of  generating  peak  powers  in  excess  of  1013  W  (that  is 
equivalent  to  500  mJ  delivered  in  50  fs).40    By  focusing  terawatt  laser  pulses  to 
irradiances exceeding 1018 W/cm2 in a pulsed supersonic helium gas jet, it is possible to 

4. 

generate  subpicosecond  electron  pulses  with  a  charge  of  a  few  nanoCoulombs  and  to 
accelerate these electrons to energies in the MeV range.41  

While  this  technology  has  been  developed  primarily  by  physicists  interested  in 

laser-plasma 

studying 
interactions  and  acceleration  physics,  nonlinear  quantum 
electrodynamics,  and  the  development  of  next  generation  x-ray  light  source,42  it  should 

be also suitable for subpicosecond pulse radiolysis experiments, provided that continued 

operation  at  a  reasonable  high  repetition  rate  (conducive  for  pump-probe  kinetic 
measurements) and sufficiently large electron flux (ca. 0.5 nC/mm2) are possible. In most 

of  the  physics  experiments  these  objectives  were  not  the  goals  (the  focus  being,  for 

example,  monochromaticity  of  the  electron  energy,  more  efficient  electron  and  proton 

acceleration,  etc.)  and  most  of  the  experiments  were  carried  out  in  what  is,  essentially, 

single  pulse  mode  with  poor  reproducibility  of  the  electron  pulse  characteristics.  By 

contrast,  for  chemical  applications,  a  typical  pump-probe  measurement  requires 
averaging of 103-104 shots.  In this case it is critical to have a source with reproducible 

parameters that operates at a reasonable repetition rate (maximum of 10 Hz for a typical 

laser  wakefield  accelerator).  Chemical  applications  present  new  demands  to  the  laser 

wakefield method itself. 

It has been shown that laser wakefield accelerators can produce sufficient charge 

per  pulse  for  detection  of  radiolysis  products  using  transient  absorbance  (TA)  laser 

spectroscopy. Using the laser wakefield accelerator (LWA) at the University of Michigan 

(Center for Ultrafast Optical Studies), subpicosecond electron pulses were generated by 

focusing  terawatt  laser  pulses  into  a  supersonic  helium  jet  and  subsequently  used  to 

ionize  liquid  water.  The  ionization  of  water  results  in  the  generation  of  metastable 
hydrated  electrons  (e-

aq)  in  which  the  s-function  of  the  excess  electron  occupies  a 

solvation cavity of ca. 0.4 nm in diameter that is formed by dangling OH groups of 6-8 
water molecules.43  This species plays the central role in water radiolysis and it strongly 
absorbs in the visible and near infrared, exhibiting the extinction coefficient of ca. 2x104 
M-1  cm-1  at  the  absorption  maximum  of  720  nm.44  Using  the  Michigan  LWA,  hydrated 
electron  concentrations as high as 2x10-5 mol dm-3  (1.2x1016 cm-3) were  generated and 
the attachment of e-

aq to traces of O2 in water was followed on the nano-to-microsecond 

5. 

timescale.45 More recently the Malka and co-workers46 have demonstrated approximately 

20 ps resolution using a LWA for pulse radiolysis of liquid water.  Below we describe the 

next generation setup that is capable of producing 10 Hz train of 2.5 nC subpicosecond 

pulses  for  hours  at  a  time,  which  enabled  us  to  perform  pulse-probe  measurements  of 

chemical  kinetics  on  a  picosecond  time  scale  using  Argonne’s  Terawatt  Ultrafast  High 

Field Facility (TUHFF) LWA.  

In  a  LWA, the electron  and laser pulses  are inherently synchronized so the time 

jitter  issues  associated  with  photocathode  linacs  are  not  an  issue.    The  ultimate  time 

resolution should depend only upon the cross correlation between the laser and electron 

pulses and the physics of the electron beam interaction with the sample. However, there 

are three main constraints that limit the current time-resolution to about 2 ps.  One of the 

major  constraints  that  limits  the  ultimate  time  resolution  for  ultrafast  radiolysis 

measurements, in general, is the fact that relativistic electrons move through the sample 

at  velocities  close  to  the  speed  of  light,  c,  whereas  the  probe  photons  travel  at  a 

substantially lower velocity, c/n (where n is the refractive index of the medium). Another 

fundamental constraint is that, unlike the linacs, the present laser wakefield accelerators 

do  not  reliably  produce  monoenergetic  beams  (although  recent  work  indicates  that  this 
will change in the near future).47-57 The TUHFF LWA  has an electron spectrum that is 

Maxwellian, with the median energy corresponding to that of the electron plasma in the 

jet.  The energy spread is more than 100% realtive to the mean.  This dispersion in energy 

results  in  the  dispersion  of  arrival  times  at  the  sample  as  the  electron  pulse  travels 

through  space;  furthermore,  since  electrons  of  different  energies  are  stopped  differently 

by  the  sample,  via  scattering  and  loss  of  energy  to  the  medium,  there  is  additional 

temporal spread of the  electron pulse in the sample. Therefore, to a much larger degree 

than  in  laser  TA  experiments,  time  resolution  is  limited  by  the  nature  and  the  physical 

dimensions of the sample, and the dispersion of the electron beam. Improvements in time 

resolution  will  require  thin  samples  and  the  development  of  more  sensitive  detection 

techniques.  

The linear energy transfer for a typical aqueous sample is 2-5 MeV/cm (for 1-100 
MeV electrons)58 and the typical radiation yield (G-value) of the species of interest is less 

6. 

than  5  per  100  eV  of  absorbed  energy.58,59    This  means  that  in  order  to  produce  a 
detectable  TA  signal  (>10-4)  from  the  radiation-induced  species  one  has  to  have  a 

sufficiently thick sample (a few millimeters) to stop the electrons. This is not the case for 

low energy photons and electrons where very thin samples can absorb most of the energy. 

Therefore, ultrafast pulse radiolysis using fast electrons (of the range that is important for 

applications)  is  always  a  compromise  between  time  resolution  and  sensitivity  of 

detection. In our present experimental configuration, the time resolution is limited not by 

the characteristics of the LWA source or synchronization issues, but by the sensitivity of 

the  TA  measurement  itself  and  the  physics  of  the  electron  interaction.  For  other  high 

energy electron sources (e.g., photocathode based linacs), that is not the case. Below, we 

describe  the  laser  wakefield  accelerator  that  provides  subpicosecond  electron  pulses  for 

chemical physics research and demonstrate its use for ultrafast studies of aqueous pulse 

radiolysis. 

II. THE LASER SYSTEM. 

The  20  TW  laser  facility3  consists  of  a  three-stage  chirped-pulse  amplified 

Ti:Sapphire  laser  system  running  at  10 Hz.  After  stretching  the  15  fs  fwhm  seed  pulse 

train from an oscillator to 440 ps in a double-pass single grating stretcher, a Pockels cell 

pulse-picker (Medox) is used to lower the repetition rate to 10 Hz. The first amplifier has 

a  multi-pass  ring  design  which  uses  a  10 mm  diameter,  10  mm  long  Brewster  angle 

amplifier  rod  (all  Ti:Sapphire  crystals  used  were  from  Crystal  Systems)  that  is  pumped 

with 25 mJ of 532 nm light that is split off of the output of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG 

laser  (all  Nd:YAG  lasers  were  from  Spectra  Physics).  After  six  passes  through  the 

crystal,  the  pulse  passes  through  a  second  Pockels  cell  and  polarizer  to  minimize  the 

amplified  spontaneous  emission  background.  The  pulse  energy  at  this  point  is  2.5  mJ 
with a beam diameter of 0.8 cm (1/e2).  The second amplifier consists of a 4-pass bowtie 

arrangement  around  an  anti-reflection  coated  20 mm  diameter,  20  mm  long  cylindrical 

Ti:sapphire  crystal.  This  crystal  is  pumped  from  both  sides  with  a  total  of  0.85  J  at 

532 nm. A -1.5 m lens is placed after the first pass to compensate for the thermal lensing 

that  occurs  in  the  amplifier  rod.  The  output  of  the  second  amplifier  is  spatially  filtered 
and expanded to 12 mm (1/e2). At this point, the pulse energy is 330 mJ. A beam splitter 

7. 

is used to divert 60 mJ of this beam to a two-grating pulse compressor and is used as a 

probe for transient absorption spectroscopy.  The remaining beam is further amplified in 

a cryogenically cooled multi-pass amplifier consisting of a 30 mm diameter, 30 mm long 

antireflection  coated  cylindrical  Ti:sapphire  crystal  held  at  77 K  in  a  liquid  nitrogen 

cryostat  (Janis  Cryogenics).    This  last  crystal  is  pumped  from  both  sides  with  a  total 

energy of 2.4 J at 532 nm. After two passes, the total energy at 800 nm is 1.1 J. In order 

to minimize the amplification of slight aberrations in the beam profile, the spatial profile 
of  the  beam  is  rotated  by  90o  after  the  first  pass.    After  the  second  pass,  the  beam  is 
expanded to 50 mm (1/e2) and is directed into a vacuum chamber housing a two-grating 

pulse compressor resulting in a 600 mJ, 35 fs fwhm pulse.  A more detailed description of 
the laser system can be found elsewhere.3 

Electron pulses of relativistic energies (1.5-20 MeV) are generated inside a target 

vacuum chamber by focusing the laser beam onto a 1.2 mm diameter supersonic helium 

jet  (Figure  1)  using  a  50 cm  focal  length  off-axis  gold  parabolic  mirror  (Janos 

Technology). A solenoid valve (Parker) fitted with a supersonic nozzle is pressurized to 

70 bar and opens for 2 ms. The valve is mounted on a motorized three-axis stage which 

allows for the optimization of the electron  yield by fine movement of the jet within the 

focus of the laser. The nozzle design and characterization were based upon the work of 
the  Malka60  and  Umstadter61  groups.    The  performance  of  the  He  jet  has  been  assessed 
using  laser  interferometric  imaging.60   We  have  tested  different  types  of  nozzle  designs 

and pressure conditions and selected the one which produced the highest electron charge 

(see below).  

III. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ELECTRON BEAM. 

The beam charge was determined using a home-built Faraday cup (FC) with a 1.3 

ns response time. The electrons were stopped in a 45 mm diameter, 25 mm thick copper 

disk  housed  inside  a  grounded  aluminum  box;  the  output  was  terminated  into  a 
load. Before hitting the cup, the electrons passed through a 400 m m thick aluminum 
50 W 

shield. Good shielding of the FC from the electromagnetic pulse generated by the plasma 

in  the  target  chamber  was  important  for  accurate  charge  measurements  to  a  few 
picoCoulombs.  The  shielding  also  protects  the  cup  from  He+  ions  generated  in  the 

8. 

chamber. The short-lived negative current spike from the FC was sampled and integrated 

on  a  fast  digital  oscilloscope  (LeCroy  model  LT354).  Alternatively,  the  current  was 

integrated using a boxcar integrator (Stanford Research Systems model 245) with a 10 ns 

gate that was calibrated against the oscilloscope signal. The latter mode was used during 

the  kinetic  measurements  in  order  to  monitor  charge  fluctuations.  These  were  normally 

distributed, with the typical dispersion of 15-30%. Under optimum conditions, the typical 

charge per pulse was 1.5-3 nC, with at least 30% of the pulses > 2 nC. Importantly, this is 

the  total  electron  charge  integrated  across  the  entire  beam.  Due  to  the  large  beam 
divergence (ca. 6-20o) and the electron scattering in the jet, the copper disk (see below) 

and the sample itself, only a fraction of the beam passes through the sample. The sample 

(typically 10 mm x 10 mm square cell made of 1 mm thick fused silica, filled with liquid) 

was placed in an aluminum holder with a 10 mm diameter aperture at the back; typically 
17  mm  away  from  the  jet.  A  rotating  copper  disk  200  m m  thick,  10  cm  diameter  was 

placed directly in front of the sample to block the laser light. The disk was rotated during 

the interval between the laser pulses with a synchronized stepper rotor (New Focus model 

8341-UHV). We found that ablation from the copper disk was much lower than that from 

an  aluminum  disk.  The  charge  throughput  through  the  empty  cell  in  the  holder  was  ca. 

25%;  and  the  throughput  for  the  same  cell  filled  with  water  was  0.8%  indicating  that  

almost all electrons were stopped by the sample.  

Figure  2a  shows  the  beam  profile  at  the  sample  obtained  by  placing  a  thin 

radioluminescent  screen  (Kodak  LANEX  film)  attached  to  a  1  mm  thick  glass  plate 

inserted at the position of the sample. The emitted light was imaged on a digital camera 
equipped with the appropriate glass filter and a 0o dielectric mirror (to exclude scattered 

800  nm  light).  The  beam  profile,  after  averaging  over  many  shots,  was  approximately 

Gaussian with semi-major 1/e axes of 11 and 12 mm (ca. 27 mm away from the jet), i.e., 
the divergence of the beam was ca. 20o. There is also a hint of a tighter 12o cone for some 

of the pulses (Figure 2b), but the position of this feature varied from shot to shot and it 

was smoothed over when averaged over many pulses.  

The  energy  spectrum  of  the  electrons  was  found  to  vary  across  the  beam,  with 

higher  energy  electrons  occupying  a  tighter  cone.  This  feature  reveals  multiple  elastic 

9. 

scattering in the jet and the metal foil used to block the light. The electrons generated in 

the plasma undergo multiple scattering events as they emerge from the jet. This scattering 

is  stronger  for  low  energy  electrons  and  it  results  in  a  steep  angular  distribution  of 

electron  energies.  Thus,  even  if  the  initial  energy  spectrum  of  the  electrons  is 
Maxwellian,  as  suggested  by  many  experiments,41,42,62  the  spectrum  of  these  electrons 

after  scattering  in  the  jet  and  the  metal  foil  is  not,  as  the  low-energy  electrons  have 

greater scattering angles. This results in an angular dependence of electron energy. 

 

Since  we  are  interested  only  in  the  energy  of  the  electrons  impinging  on  the 

sample,  a  spectrometer  was  built  to  determine  the  average  energies  of  the  electrons 

passing through a copper collimator. This spectrometer consisted of two NdFeB magnets 

sandwiched  between  two  steel  bars  and  mounted  on  a  copper  plate.  A  soft  steel  shield 

was  placed  in  front  of  this  plate  to  screen  stray  magnetic  field.  A  phosphor  screen  was 

placed  65  mm  behind  the  aperture  and  imaged  on  a  camera;  a  thin  Al  foil  before  this 

screen blocked the 800 nm light. The inhomogeneity of the magnetic field in the vertical 

direction  was  <  1%.  The  magnetic  field  B(x)  along  the  path  of  the  light  (axis  x)  was 

mapped  using  a  Hall  probe  magnetometer.  For  every  initial  energy  E  of  the  electron 

moving in the forward direction through the aperture, the relativistic equations of motion 
in the field  B x( ) were integrated and vertical position  ys E( ) at which the curved electron 
trajectory  intersects  with  the  phosphor  screen  determined.  For  the  geometry  described, 
» 90 mm) and the 

the minimum detectable  energy E was 1.5 MeV  (corresponding to  ys

maximum energy that can be resolved using a collimator with a 5 mm diameter aperture 

was  20  MeV.  The  aperture  was  placed  135  mm  away  from  the  jet  and  the  image  of 

dispersed electrons on a LANEX screen was collected and averaged for 100 laser shots, 

with and without the jet pulsed (in order to subtract the background). An example of the 

dispersed electron beam is shown in Figures 3a and 3b. For the 5 mm diameter aperture 
» 13  mm  which 
(a  2o  cone;  see  Figure  3a),  the  electron  distribution  peaked  at  ys

corresponds to 7.5 MeV. The high energy tail extends to 20-25 MeV and there is a low-

energy wing, with roughly 50% of electrons at the minimum (cut-off) energy of 1.5 MeV 

as compared with the maximum at 5-10 MeV. For a larger aperture of 32 mm diameter (a 
13.5o  cone)  the  position  of  the  maximum  shifts  to  4  MeV  and  the  energy  spectrum  is 

10. 

more  Maxwellian  (Figure  3b).  There  is  a  clear  "tail"  extending  towards  the  higher 

energies. The probability to find the electron at 20 MeV is roughly 30% of that at 4 MeV. 

There  is  also  a  gradual  onset  of  the  distribution  at  1-2  MeV.  Once  more,  this  gradual 

onset is due to the scattering of low-energy electrons into a wider cone.  

A  stack  of  0.5-3  mm thick  Al  plates  with the  polyester-based  radiochromic  film 
(GAFCHROMIC MD-55, 270 m m thick, with the stopping power of ca. 2 MeV/cm at 1-3 

MeV) pressed between the plates was exposed to 20-50 electron pulses, and the film was 

scanned with resolution of 200 dpi. The film is about 5 times more sensitive at 675 nm 

than at 550 nm, i.e., by scanning the same film in red, green, and blue (with the relative 

sensitivity  of  15.7:3.4:1)  over-exposure  can  be  avoided.  At  maximum  sensitivity  (675 

nm)  the  optical  density  is  ca.  0.03  per  1  J/kg  of  absorbed  radiation.  The  typical  dose 

profile  across  the  beam  behind  a  19  mm  diameter,  6.4  mm  thick  copper  aperture  (the 

radiochromic  film  was  placed  27.9  mm  away  from  the  jet  plane)  is  shown  in  Figure  2.  
The distribution of the dose in nearly uniform within the 22o cone; on top of this broad 
distribution there is a narrower cone of 6o that carries less than a few per cent of the dose 

(this tighter distribution is from higher-energy electrons). Due to the electron scattering in 

the  plates,  this  feature  rapidly  fades  as  the  electrons  penetrate  through  the  stack,  the 

profile becomes nearly  Gaussian.   By  integrating over these profiles one can obtain the 

transverse  profile  of  dose  deposition  shown  in  Figure  4.    Maxwell's  distribution

from which the mean energy loss as a function of thickness x of the material and charge 

throughput  can  be  estimated.  Convoluting  this  profile  with  the  initial  Maxwell 

distribution,  one  obtains  the  power  spectrum  of  the  electrons  at  a  given  depth  x.  The 

calculated dose deposition profile can be  compared with the experimental one, with the

, which thereby is the temperature of the electron plasma in energy 

units.  The  predicted  spectrum  of  the  electrons  1  mm  inside  the  aqueous  sample 

(integrated over the entire beam) is shown in Figure 5(a). 

 

Using this spectrum it is easy to estimate the dispersion of arrival times t(E)  for 

the  electrons  at  the  normal  plane  containing  the  optical  path  of  the  probe  (Figure  5(b). 

Most  of  this  dispersion  originates  from  low-energy  electrons  that  move  significantly 

slower than the speed of light but are abundant at the onset of the thermal distribution of 
energies. Some of these electrons are stopped by the 200 m m copper shield and the glass 

cell walls so only electrons with energies > 1 MeV arrive at the sample, which is ca. 70% 

of the total charge. For high-energy electrons (above the median energy) the dispersion is 

only 1.5 ps, but for low energy electrons that pass through the sample, it is ca. 2.8 ps, so 

the overall spread is ca. 4.3 ps fwhm. Using a thicker copper shield would result in better 
shaping  of  the  electron  spectrum:  e.g.,  a  600  m m  copper  shield  yields  a  3  ps  fwhm 

dispersion of arrival times (with 1.3 MeV cutoff and 45% of the electrons stopped before 

the sample). These are conservative estimates: due to the electron scattering, the spectrum 

of the electrons in the cone arriving at the sample is already depleted of the low-energy 

electrons.  A  more  realistic  estimate  of  this  dispersion  under  the  conditions  of  our 

experiment was about 2 ps fwhm.  

IV. DETECTION SYSTEM 

The  detection  system  was  used  to  determine  time  evolution  of  transient 

absorbance  at  800  nm  (that  is,  the  temporal  change  in  the  optical  density,  ODD

)  using 

pump-probe methodology.  The 800 nm beam from the second amplifier was compressed 

using  a  standard  two-grating  compressor  to  <  30  fs  fwhm  and  suitably  delayed  to 

temporally overlap the electron and probe pulses at the sample. In one of the delay arms, 

a 80 cm double pass motorized delay stage (Velmex) was inserted. The probe light was 

split  1:1,  with  one  beam  serving  as  a  reference,  to  compensate  for  fluctuations  in  the 

probe  light  intensity.  The  second  beam,  used  to  probe  the  sample,  was  steered  into  the 
target chamber where it intersected with the electron beam at 90o inside the sample cell. 

12. 

A  pair  of  photodiode  detectors  (Si  FND-100Q,  -100 V  bias)  were  encased  in  a  Faraday 

cage  and  shielded  behind  a  10  cm  thick  lead  wall  erected  3  m  away  from  the  target 

chamber so that the electromagnetic interference from plasma discharge and stray gamma 
rays were mostly eliminated (to less than 10-6 OD). The probe beams were spatially and 

spectrally filtered so that very little light from the plasma spark reached the detectors ( < 
3x10-6 OD).  The sampling electronics are similar to those described in reference 63. 

A second probe beam (Figure 1), was derived from a 670 nm cw diode laser and 

used  to  compensate  for  pulse-to-pulse  variations  in  the  absorbed  dose  and  for  chemical 

dosimetry  (see  below).  It  propagated  along  the  same  optical  path  as  the  800  nm  probe 

beam.  Both of these probe beams  were used to  measure  TA signal from 

aqe . However, 

whereas the 800 nm beam was used to obtain the TA on the picosecond time scale in a 

stroboscopic  fashion,  the  670  nm  cw  beam  registered  the  same  absorption  on  the 

nanosecond  to  microsecond  time  scales  using  a  30  MHz  Si  photodiode  and  a  fast 
transient digitizer. TA signals as small as 5x10-6 OD may be detected using this cw probe 

beam.  The  absolute  measurement  of  the  product  yield  (G-value)  in  pulse  radiolysis  is 

given  in  molecules  per  100  eV  of  absorbed  radiation  (assuming  linear  energy  transfer). 

To determine this quantity in pulse-probe experiments one has to know the deposition of 

the dose along the exact optical path of the probe beam. Since the energy/dose profile is 

complex (Figures 3 to 5) and depends on the sample, only chemical dosimetry is suitable. 

For  a  long-lived  light-absorbing  species  like  the  hydrated  electron,  an  option  exists  to 

observe the TA signal on a longer time scale using a cw laser beam. This signal can be 

used  to  determine  electron  absorbance  at  delay  time  >  500  ns  which  can  be  used  to 

determine the absolute  yield of hydrated electron at earlier times since the G-values for 

electron production at long delay times (ca. 2.65 by the end of the geminate stage, in the 
low-dose regime) are known from many previous experiments.59 

Since pulse-to-pulse fluctuations in the beam charge are large (20-30% variance) 

and  the  repetition  rate  is  relatively  low  (10  Hz),  compensation  of  these  fluctuations  by 

normalization  of  the  TA  signal  is  important.  Both  short-  and  long-  lived  absorbance 

signals  scale  linearly  with  the  dose.  If  both  the  pulsed  and  CW  beams  probe  the  same 

region of the sample, the two TA signals will track each other. This proportionality can 

13. 

-
be  used  to  compensate  for  the  variation  in  the  dose  deposition.  Two  approaches  were 

explored simultaneously:  (1) using the total charge of the electrons passing through the 

sample  measured  with  the  FC  placed  behind  the  sample  cell,  and  (2)  using  cw-probed 

long-lived TA signal. The FC and long-lived TA signals were integrated using a boxcar 

integrator-averager  or  numerically,  using  the  signal  acquired  on  the  oscilloscope.  This 

detection  system  was  tested  by  using  the  frequency  doubled  (400  nm)  laser  beam  as  a 

pump;  a  solution  of  octathiophen  in  toluene  was  used  as  a  test  system;  the  photodiode 

signal  from  the  400  nm  light  passing  through  the  sample  imitated  the  FC  signal  and  a 

thermal  lens  signal  in  the  sample  imitated  the  long-lived  TA  signal.  The  two  final 

Nd:YAG amplifiers were put in an unstable regime so that the pump power fluctuated by 

100%.  These  tests  demonstrated  that  with  our  detection  setup  the  stabilization  of  the 

signal within 5% at 10 Hz acquisition could be readily achieved. This test also served to 

find the temporal overlap between the electron and 800 nm pulses. In the pulse radiolysis 

runs,  we  used  the  FC  and  TA  signals  not  only  to  normalize  the  pulse-probe  signal  but 

also  to  reject  20-30%  of  electron  pulses  with  low  charge  at  the  tail  of  the  charge 

variation. All of these measures resulted in a considerable improvement of the signal-to-
noise  ratio.  The  typical  error  in  the  optical  density  measurement  was  5x10-4  for  the 
average of 10 pulses, for a TA signal of (5-20)x10-3 OD. 

The general scheme for the acquisition of picosecond TA kinetics was as follows: 

the TW laser pulses were passed into the compressor in bunches of 10 at 5 Hz, and the 

TA signals and the charge on the FC recorded. Low-charge pulses were rejected, and the 

integrated TA signal for 670 nm light was used for normalization of the TA signal probed 

at  800  nm.  The  TW  laser  beam  was  then  blocked  for  10  shots  to  balance  the  reference 

and the probe dark signals. This sequence was repeated several times for each delay time 

of  the  probe  beam.  The  quality  of  the  TW  laser  beam  mode  was  continually  monitored 

for  signs  of  optics  damage  at  several  pick-off  points  using  CCD  cameras.  Most  of  the 

metal ejecta coming from the rotating copper disk blocking the laser was intercepted by a 

shield placed in front of the jet with a 5 mm diameter aperture for the 800 nm light, but 

some  ejecta  was  eventually  deposited  on  the  parabolic  mirror,  limiting  its  lifetime  to  a 

few  hours  before  replacement.  A  related  problem  was  the  slow  deposition  of  graphitic 

14. 

carbon  on  the  diffraction  gratings  during  high-power  operation.  The  latter  was  reversed 

by a periodic ultraviolet light and ozone treatment. 

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In order to assess the time resolution experimentally achievable using our system, 
-)  generated  in  pulse 
we  have  studied  the  decay  kinetics  of  hydrated  electrons  (eaq
radiolysis of liquid water and concentrated perchloric acid solutions at 25  oC. Upon the 

photoionization,  the  water  molecule  ejects  the  electron  that  subsequently  localizes  and 
-. The probe wavelength (800 nm) is close to the maximum (720 

thermalizes, yielding eaq

nm)  of  the  absorption  spectrum  of  the  thermalized,  fully  hydrated  species  in  room-

temperature  water.  Other  species  generated  in  water  radiolysis,  such  as  OH  and  OH2 

radicals  and  H  atoms  do  not  absorb  at  800  nm.  Laser  experiments  in  which  water  is 

biphotonically ionized using femtosecond pulses of ultraviolet light  suggest that the local 

equilibrium between the cavity electron and water molecules around it is reached in < 1 
ps,  as  judged  from  the  evolution  of  the  TA  spectrum.64  Before  this  equilibrium  is  fully 

reached,  the  pre-thermalized  electron  occupies  a  distorted,  loose  cavity  and  exhibits  a 
broad  TA  spectrum  that  is  shifted  to  the  red  from  the  final  one.64  As  the  electron 

thermalizes  (with  the  characteristic  time  of  ca.  200-300  fs)  this  TA  spectrum 

continuously  narrows  and  shifts  to  the  blue;  a  similar  shift  can  be  observed  for  the 
thermalized electron when water is cooled from 100 to 0 oC.44  At 800 nm, the evolution 
of  the  TA  signal  is  complete  in  1.5  ps.64    The  situation  in  pulse  radiolysis  is  less  clear, 

because  the  electrons  are  generated  in  spurs  that  thermalize  with  the  water  bulk  on  the 
picosecond  time  scale,9  as  the  heat  generated  in  the  excitation  and  ionization  events 

diffuses away. The tremendous amount of energy  that is deposited within the spur may 

result in the overall thermalization rate that is slower than that observed in photolysis. 

 As discussed in the Introduction, in ultrafast pulse radiolysis (to a much greater 

degree  than  in  ultrafast  laser  spectroscopy),  the  real  time  resolution  depends  on  the 

sample, in particular, on the sample thickness. The deoxygenated sample was placed in a 

sealed fused silica cell (with 1 mm thick wall) that measured 10 mm in the direction of 

the  electron  beam  and  2,  5,  or  10  mm  in  the  direction  of  the  800  nm  probe  light.  The 
probe beam intersected the cell 200 m m away from the front window of the cell. Figure 

15. 

6(a) exhibits the kinetics for eaq

- obtained in water for these three cells. The three kinetics 

shown in Figure 6(a) were obtained on different runs with slightly different electron pulse 

characteristics.  We  have  checked  that  the  TA  signal  is  proportional  to  the  sample 

thickness when the measurements were performed under identical conditions.  

There  are  three  factors  that  determine  the  rise  time  of  the  TA  signal:  (1)  the 

formation time of the species and the time scale of their spectral evolution, (2) the pulse 

duration (and dispersion) of the electron beam at different points in the sample, and (3) 

the traveling time of the probe through the  radiolytic zone. On the time  scale of Figure 
-  can  be  considered  as  instantaneous  (although  that  is  not 

6(a),  the  formation  of  eaq

necessarily  correct  for  the  TA  signal,  as  explained  above).  Assuming  that  the  pulse 

duration for the electrons emerging from the jet is comparable in the duration to the TW 

laser pulse, and knowing the electron spectrum, the dispersion of the arrival times for the 

electrons at the sample was estimated as 3-4 ps (see section III). Given the large diameter 

of  the  electron  beam  at  the  sample  (which  is  commensurate  with  the  sample  thickness) 

one  would  expect  that  the  second  factor  determines  the  rise  time  of  the  TA  signal 

observed. In principle, this rising part of the kinetics can be simulated from the calculated 
-) along the path of the probe beam. In reality, 

dose distribution (i.e., the distribution of eaq

this distribution is not known exactly, and moreover it fluctuates from pulse to pulse. In 

order to make a comparison with other experimental systems the kinetics were fit by an 

error function which corresponds to a hypothetical experiment with a Gaussian pulse of 
electrons,  infinitely  thin  sample  and  collinear  beam  geometry.  The  1/e2  Gaussian  times 

obtained from the data in this fashion are 17.9, 8.3, and 4.4 ps for 10, 5, and 2 mm cells, 

respectively.  Thus  the  “pulse  width”  scales  with  the  sample  thickness,  supporting  the 

assumption of short electron pulse duration. Thus the best “pulse width” obtained was on 

the order of 4 ps.  In principle, this width can be shortened further by the use of thinner 

samples, better shaping of the electron spectrum, and collinear detection.  

We  have  also  performed  radiolysis  of  1  and  5  mol  dm-3  solutions  of  perchloric 

acid in a 10 mm optical path cell. Figure 6(b) shows the kinetics obtained. The fast decay 
- with the hydronium (H3O+) ions in the solution (this reaction 
is due to the reaction of eaq
yields  H  atoms  that  do  not  absorb  at  800  nm).65-67    The  kinetics  were  fit  to  a  single 
exponential  convoluted  with  the  error  function.  The  obtained  decay  rates  were  7.1x109 

16. 

and 5.4x1010 s-1 in 1 and 5 mol dm-3 solutions, respectively. These rate constants are in 
agreement  with  the  previously  published  data  obtained  using  a  linac.66,67   An  intriguing 
feature of the 5 mol dm-3 kinetics shown in Figure 6(b) is the apparent broadening of the 
“pulse width.” This broadening has already been observed67 with time resolution at least 

an order of magnitude slower than reported here. According to the analysis given therein, 

it  cannot  be  accounted  for  by  full  consideration  of  the  electron  and  probe  beam 

propagation  in  the  sample,  possibly  suggesting  new  chemistry.  The  presence  of  5  mol 
dm-3 of the anions considerably shifts the absorption spectrum of the electron to the blue, 
- at 800 
- in the spur (and the spur itself) 

which results in greater sensitivity of the kinetics to the spectral evolution of eaq

nm, as the spectrum shifts during the thermalization of eaq

on the picosecond time scale. This interesting behavior will be pursued in our subsequent 

studies. 

VI. CONCLUSION 

We have shown that a tabletop laser wakefield accelerator can achieve picosecond 

resolution for pulse-probe radiation chemistry experiments on condensed matter systems.  

Transient  absorption  kinetics  were  acquired  in  the  stroboscopic  fashion  typical  of  other 

ultrafast methods, which required a robust design capable of continuous operation at 5-10 

Hz. The time resolution was better or comparable to that for photocathode driven linacs; 

in fact, it is presently limited by the physics of electron deposition into the sample and the 

sensitivity of the detection rather than the source characteristics per se. If the sensitivity is 

improved,  subpicosecond  time  resolution  using  this  scheme  will  be  possible.  As  it 

presently is, this time resolution (determined by the rise in the TA signal) is about 2 ps .

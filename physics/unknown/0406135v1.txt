A new graphical method is developed to calculate the critical temperature of 2- and 3-dimensional Ising
models as well as that of the 2-dimensional Potts models. This method is based on the transfer matrix method
and using the limited lattice for the calculation. The reduced internal energy per site has been accurately
calculated for different 2-D Ising and Potts models using different size-limited lattices. All calculated energies
intersect at a single point when plotted versus the reduced temperature. The reduced temperature at the
intersection is 0.4407, 0.2746, and 0.6585 for the square, triangular, and honeycombs Ising lattices and 1.0050,
0.6309, and 1.4848 for the square, triangular, and honeycombs Potts lattices, respectively. These values are
exactly the same as the critical temperatures reported in the literature, except for the honeycomb Potts lattice.
For the two-dimensional Ising model, we have shown that the existence of such an intersection point is due
to the duality relation. The method is then extended to the simple cubic Ising model, in which the intersection
point is found to be dependent on the lattice sizes. We have found a linear relation between the lattice size
and the intersection point. This relation is used to obtain the critical temperature of the unlimited simple
cubic lattice. The obtained result, 0.221(2), is in a good agreement with the accurate value of 0.22165 reported
by others.

Introduction

For many years, the lattice statistics has been the subject of
intense research interests. Although, at zero magnetic field, there
is an exact solution for the 2-dimensional (2-D) Ising model,1
however, there is no such a solution for the 3-dimensional (3-
D) Ising and 2-D Potts models. The Potts models are the general
extension of the Ising model with q-state spin lattice,2 i.e., the
Potts model with q ) 2 is equivalent to the Ising model. In the
absence of an exact solution, series expansions remain as one
of the most useful tools in the investigation of the critical
properties of a model system. Domb3,4 has provided a historical
review of series expansions solutions for the Ising model. A
similar review article for the Potts model is provided by Wu5
and more recently by Biggs.6,7 In the series expansions method,
which is based on the graph theory,7 the partition function is
expanded as a series that counts closed graphs of all possible
number of bonds of the lattice. In addition to the complexity of
the calculation, the disadvantage of this method is that the
precision of the calculated critical data depends on the number
of terms in the truncated series.

Other techniques, which have been developed during the past
two decades, are the simulation methods,8-12 especially the
Monte Carlo method. The precision of the calculated critical
point obtained by this method depends on the number of
particles used in the model system i.e., the lattice size. Because
of the limitation in computer resources we cannot freely increase
the size of lattice.

In a recent work, Ranjbar and Parsafar13 used a limited
number of rows, but with the same coordination number for
each site to set up the transfer matrix for the square lattice in
the Ising model. The resultant matrix was solved for the model

in the
absence of any magnetic field. The calculated reduced internal
energy per site, u(K), was then plotted versus the reduced
temperature, K, for the square lattice with different lattice sizes,
where K ) j/kT and j > 0 is the coupling energy for the nearest-
neighbor spins. It was observed that all of them intersect at a
single point known as the critical temperature. Since the order
of the transfer matrix becomes too large for both the Potts and
the method cannot be extended to
the 3-D Ising models,
calculate the critical temperature for these models, analytically.
In the present work we have extended the method of Ranjbar
and Parsafar13 to numerically calculate the critical temperature
for the 2-D Potts and Ising and 3-D Ising models. In the
following section, we have shown that the existence of the
duality relation for the two-dimensional Ising model implies
that the u(K) at the critical temperature must be independent of
the size of lattice. Owing to this fact, we have been able to
calculate the critical temperature of the square, triangular, and
honeycomb lattices. We have then extended the method to the
3-state Potts models for the 2-D lattices. We have shown that
our method can be easily used to obtain the critical point for
the 2-D Potts models. The method has been also extended to
the 3-D Ising model. Unlike the 2-D models, according to our
results, the location of the intersection point depends on the
lattice sizes, in other words there is no single intersection point.
We have found that the location of the intersection point versus
the lattice size is almost linear. We have extrapolated the line
to the unlimited lattice size to obtain the critical temperature of
simple cubic lattice.

The Duality Relation and The Common Intersection
Point

Consider a square lattice with the periodic boundary condition
composed of slices, each with p rows, where each row has r
sites. Each slice has then p Æ r ) N sites and the coordination

number of all sites is the same. In the 2-D Ising model, for any
site we define a spin variable (cid:243)(i,j) ) (1, in such a way that
i ) 1,...,r and j ) 1,...,p. We include the periodic boundary
condition as:

(cid:243)(i + r, j) ) (cid:243)(i, j)

(cid:243)(i, j + p) ) (cid:243)(i, j)

We take only the interactions among the nearest neighbors
into account. The configurational energy for the model is given
as,

and K(cid:247) is the reduced temperature of the dual lattice. By the
well-known duality relation4,5,14, i.e., e-2K(cid:247) ) tanh (K), eq 13
can be written as:

cosh((cid:231)i) ) coth(2K)cosh(2K) - cos(i(cid:240)

(16)

Because at the critical temperature sinh2(2Kc) ) 1(see ref
14), we may conclude from eq 16 that @(cid:231)i/@K ) 0 and, hence,
u(Kc)is independent of the lattice size r. The same conclusion
can be easily obtained for both the triangular and honeycomb
Ising lattices, see appendix A.

The numerical calculation of u(K) can be easily programmed
by the well-known mathematical softwares such as Maple,
Mathlab, Mathematica,..., and ARPACK. For the square lattice
with size r, by using eq 8, the elements of the B matrix have
been calculated numerically. We have used ARPACK to
calculate the largest eigenvalue, (cid:236)max, of the B matrix for
different K values, and along with eqs 10 and 11 the values of
u(K) have been calculated. The calculation has been repeated
for different lattice sizes. Then, by drawing u(K) versus K for
different lattice sizes, as expected, all of them intersect at a single
point known as the critical point. Such a calculation was also
been done for the triangular and honeycomb lattices, see Figures
1 and 2. The results of such calculations are compared with the
exact values3,4 in Table 1, which are exactly the same.

The Potts Model

Although we do not know the exact solution of the Potts
model for the 2-dimension at present time, a large amount of
numerical information has been accumulated for the critical
properties of the various Potts models. For further information,
see the excellent review written by Wu5 or the references given
by him. The reason for the extension of our approach to the
Potts model is the fact that such a model is an important testing
ground for different methods and approaches in the study of
critical point theory. Although in the absence of any exact
solution for the Potts model we cannot analytically extend the
duality argument to drive the size independence of the u(Kc),
we may test our approach numerically.

Consider a square lattice with the periodic boundary condition
composed of slices, each with p rows, where each row has r
sites. Then each slice has p Æ r ) N sites and the coordination
number of all sites are the same. For any site we define a spin
variable (cid:243)(i, j) ) 0, (1 so that i)1,...,r and j)1,...,p. The
configurational energy of the standard 3-state Potts model is
given as,5

The value of u(K) was calculated, numerically, and drawn
versus K for different lattice sizes. Again, all of them intersect
at a single point, see Figure 3, which is the critical point. Such
a calculation was also carried out for the honeycomb and
triangular lattices, for which the matrix elements are given in
appendix B, along with those for the Ising models. For each
case we have observed a common intersection point which is
given in Table 1.

3-Dimensional Ising Model

Although there is not any well-known duality relation in the
three-dimensional Ising model,15 our method can easily be
extended to the 3-dimensional lattice. For simplicity, consider
a simple cubic lattice with the periodic boundary condition
composed of slices, each has p layers. Each layer has r rows
and each row has m sites. Then, each slice (limited lattice) has
p Æ r Æ m ) N sites. A layer of a slice with its nearest neighbor
slices is shown in Figure 4 in which the periodic boundary
condition is taken into account. For any site we define a spin
variable (cid:243)(i, j, k) ) (1 in such a way that i)1,...,m, j)1,...,r,
l)1,...,p. We include the periodic boundary condition as:

(cid:243)(i + m, j, l) ) (cid:243)(i, j, l)

(cid:243)(i, j + r, l) ) (cid:243)(i, j, l)

(cid:243)(i, j, l + p) ) (cid:243)(i, j, l)

Conclusion

tions are performed on a PC cluster composed of four dual
computers with PIII 550 MHz processors. The calculated
reduced energy for simple cubic lattice with (r ) 3, m ) 3), (r
) 4, m ) 4), and (r ) 4, m ) 4) was plotted vesus K, shown
in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, the location of the intersection
point depends on the sizes of the lattices and it may be related
to the fact that there is not any well-known duality relation for
the 3-dimensional Ising model.15 As shown in Figure 5, with
increasing the sizes of the lattices the value of K ) j/kT at the
intersection point decreases. To obtain the value of KC, we have
to obtain the intersection point for two unlimited lattices with
different sizes, however, such a point may be predicted if we
have an expression for the intersection point in terms of 1/n,
where n ) mrm¢ r¢ . To do so, the intersection points of Figure
5 have been plotted versus 1/n. As shown in Figure 6, the points
are located almost on the straight line of Kc ) 2.4454/n+0.2212
with R2 ) 0.99997, where R2 is the linear correlation. The value

of Kc ) 0.2212 for the intercept is the critical temperature for
the unlimited simple cubic lattice of Ising model.

We have shown that our graphical method, in principle, can
be applied to the 2-D and 3-D Ising and Potts models. For the
2-D Ising models, the existence of a duality relation can be used
to accurately calculate the critical temperature. In fact, our
numerical results are exactly the same as the reported exact
values,3,4 for such cases.

The only exact solution of the Potts model known to date is
the Onsager’s solution1 of the two-state Potts model, and the
transformation to the dual is known analytically1,14 for this case.
For the other models, the duality relation is expected to be at
work, but its existence has only been tested numerically.15,16
The existence of the conjectured duality relation3,5,6,18,19 has been
used to calculate the critical temperature. Although our calcu-
lated critical temperatures for the square and triangular lattices
are exactly the same as those predicted values by other methods,5
for the honeycomb lattice there is a small difference between
our calculated value and that obtained from the formula given
by Wu5 (i.e., Equation 5.1b of ref 5). For this reason, such

difference for the honeycomb lattice may be attributed to the
incompleteness of eq 5.1b of ref 5.

We have shown that our method can be used to calculate the
temperature of the simple cubic Ising model. The
critical
obtained result, 0.221(2), is in a good agreement with the
accurate value of 0.22165, obtained from the recent simulation
methods.11,12 The small inaccuracy in our results is due to the
limitation dictated by available computer resources. However,
we expect to obtain more accuracy if matrixes of higher orders
than 216 are used.

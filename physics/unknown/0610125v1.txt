Abstract 
In recent years networks have gained unprecedented attention in studying a broad range of topics, among them in complex systems 
research. In particular, multi-agent systems have seen an increased recognition of the importance of the interaction topology. It is now 
widely  recognized  that  emergent  phenomena  can  be  highly  sensitive  to  the  structure  of  the  interaction  network  connecting  the 
system’s components, and there is a growing body of abstract network classes, whose contributions to emergent dynamics are well-
understood. However, much less understanding have yet been gained about the effects of network dynamics, especially in cases when 
the emergent phenomena feeds back to and changes the underlying network topology.  
Our  work  starts  with  the  application  of  the  network  approach  to  discrete  choice  analysis,  a  standard  method  in  econometric 
estimation, where the classic approach is grounded in individual choice and lacks social network influences. In this paper, we extend 
our earlier results by considering the endogenous dynamics of social networks. In particular, we study a model where the behavior 
adopted by the agents feeds back to the underlying network structure, and report results obtained by computational multi-agent based 
simulations. 

Introduction    

In recent years networks have gained unprecedented attention in studying a broad range of topics, among them in complex 
systems research. In particular, multi-agent systems have seen an increased recognition of the importance of the interaction 
topology.  It  is  now  widely  recognized  that  emergent  phenomena  can  be  highly  sensitive  to  the  structure  of  the  interaction 
network connecting the system’s components, and there is a growing body of abstract network classes, whose contributions 
to  emergent  dynamics  are  well-understood.  However,  much  less  understanding  have  yet  been  gained  about  the  effects  of 
network  dynamics,  especially  in  cases  when  the  emergent  phenomena  feeds  back  to  and  changes  the  underlying  network 
topology.  
Our work starts with the application of the network approach to discrete choice analysis, a standard method in econometric 
estimation  with  applications,  among  others,  in  land  use  and  transportation  planning  models.  (Ben-Akiva  1973;  Ben-Akiva 
and  Lerman  1985;  Ben-Akiva  and  Morikawa  1990)  The  field's  developments  over  the  past  30  years  range  from  the  basic 
random utility model to incorporate cognitive and behavioral processes, etc. However, the classic approach of discrete choice 
theory is fundamentally grounded in individual choice, which is in contrast with both intuition and with recent observations 
of the importance of social networks. Earlier work by the authors (Gulyás and Dugundji 2003a, 2003b; Dugundji and Gulyás 
2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2006) considered a family of models where agents were placed on instances of abstract network classes 
and an agent’s choice to adopt a discrete behavior was influenced by the percentages of the agent’s neighbors making each 
choice. In this paper, we extend these results by considering the endogenous dynamics of social networks. In particular, we 
study a model where the behavior adopted by the agents feeds back to the underlying network structure. (E.g., a decision to 
commute by train instead of car increases the likelihood of train-choosing acquaintances.) We report results obtained by the 
application of computational multi-agent based simulations. 

Discrete Choices  
in the Presence of Social Influence 

Let’s consider a set A of N agents, indexed by a˛
choices made by the agents at any fixed time t are denoted by s
given by the rule set R, which consists of parameterized probability distributions for each agent: 

1,…,y M}. The

[1,N], each of which has to choose among M choices, Y ={y

Binary Logit Rules on Erdős-Rényi Networks 
In  the  following  we  will  consider  binary  logit  decision  rules  on  Erdős-Rényi  random  graphs,  where  the  single  decision 
making parameter for the agents is social influence. (Erdős and Rényi, 1959) That is, the number of choices is fixed at M=2 

˛
˛
˛
(for example, car versus public transit) and the rules of R are based on the probabilistic logit model as described below. (Ben-
Akiva and Lerman 1985) 
Given M fixed at 2, we have two complementary alternatives. For convenience, we introduce a notation: for any alternative j 
[0,1] stand for the so-called “systematic” utility that agent a 
let  j  stand for the complementary choice. Moreover, let 
associates  with  alternative  j  at  time  t.  Then,  according  to  the  binary  logit  model,  the  probability  that  agent  a  chooses 
alternative j is given by:  

ajU ˛

t

Following the spirit of (Aoki 1995) and (Brock and Durlauf 2001; Blume and Durlauf 2002) social dynamics is introduced by 
allowing the difference 

in systematic utility to be a linear-in-parameter b  function of the proportion wt

Initially, agents are assigned random choices drawn from an uniform distribution. They are also given a a set of neighbors, 
according to their position in graph G.  

Summary of Results on Static Networks 
As seen earlier, for low values of the b  parameter the agents’ decision making lacks any systemic property. Therefore, the 
aggregate outcome on static Erdős-Rényi networks is also essentially random: the difference between the number of agents 
choosing  the  two  alternatives  oscillates  around  0.  On  the  other  hand,  if  b   is  above  a  threshold,  the  agent  population  may 
converge to an unanimous decision (disturbed only by occasional random perturbations caused by the stochastic nature of the 
agent  decision  making  process),  depending  on  the  network  topology.  In  particular,  if  the  network  density  (the  uniform 
probability for each possible link to be present, expressed in our treatment as a multiplier of 1/N) is above the connectivity 
threshold (Molloy and Reed 1998), we observe unanimous aggregate outcomes, which may equally be either of the choices. 
Below this threshold, however, the difference between the  sizes of the parties choosing  the different alternatives oscillates 
around  zero,  just  like  in  the  low-b   case.(Dugundji  and  Gulyás  2005,  2006;  Gulyás  2005)  Fig.  1  demonstrates  these 
observations with results from numerical experiments carried out using the RePast agent-based simulation package. (North, 
Collier and Vos 2006)i 
On Watts-Strogatz networks we observe a similar two-phased behavior depending on the average distance between pairs of 
nodes in the network. (Watts and Strogatz 1998; Gulyás 2005)

Social Network Dynamics 
In the following we consider dynamic networks, i.e., cases when changes in the interaction topology (D ) are at the same or a 
comparable time-scale than the repeated decision making of the agents. In principle, there are two approaches to incorporate 
network dynamics into our model. One regards changes in the social influence network as external to the process of making 
discrete  choices.  The  other  considers  them  to  be  inherently  connected  to  the  process  of  making  discrete  choices.  In  the 
former, exogenous case, changes can either be  modeled as a stochastic process or, if  more information is available on the 
network dynamics, a specific model of network evolution can be created. The focus of the present work is the latter case of 
endogenous  network  dynamics,  where  changes  in  the  interaction  topology  are  induced  by  the  discrete  choice  dynamics 
ongoing on the very network. (See Fig. 2 for an illustration of this circular pattern of influence.)

The Endogenous Network Model  

The  intuition  behind  our  model  of  endogenous  network  dynamics  is  that  a  person’s  making  a  choice  is  a  sign  of  her 
preference. Therefore, it can be interpreted as an increased likelihood that the person’s future acquintances will have made 
the same choice. The same time, the person is less likely to maintain contact with former acquintances that made the opposite 
decision. We operationalize this approach as follows. 

[0,N-1] denote the number of agent i’s neighbors that have made the same decision than agent i at time t. Similarly, 
[0,1] denote the ratio of such agents and the total number of neighbors. (In the following we will omit the superscript t 

i˛
Let dt
i˛
let zt
wherever it doesn’t sacrifice understandability.) 
Starting  from  a  random  network  as  in  the  static  case,  we  define  D di,  i.e.,  the  change  that  occurs  in  the  number  of  same-
minded neighbors as a function of zi. Initially, the agent will seek similar neighbors, but as the ratio reaches a threshold (T), it 
will rather opt for opposite-minded partners. Formally,  

L
L
where  L  is  a  parameter  (kept  constant  at  1  in  our  experiments).  The  above  definition  of  D di  is  regarded  as  subject  of  the 
following constraints: 

► Multiple links to the same agent and self-links (loops)  are not allowed. 
► The network density must be kept constant (as it is, from our earlier results, known to be a parameter to which aggregate 
behavior is sensitive). Therefore, each new neighbor ‘costs’ a link to the opposite group. If no such link exists, the new 
partner cannot be added.

The left column shows results obtained for T=0, the middle column has data for T=0.5, while the right column shows 
values with T=1. The top row contains time series plotting aggregate difference between the choices versus time. The

Notice  that  the  above  definition  identifies  a  class  of  potential  ‘future  networks’,  among  which  we  apply  a  probabilistic 
selection  according  to  the  following  procedure.  Agents  update  their  partners  at  the  end  of  each  round  sequentially  in  a 
randomized  order.  An  agent  first  determines  the  number  of  links  to  be  added  and  the  choice  of  the  new  partners.  Then  it 
attempts  to  select  the  appropriate  number  of  new  partners  randomly  and  adds  them  one  by  one  as  long  as  it  can  find  an 

-
£
D
existing neighbor with the opposite choice to be dropped. The latters are also picked randomly. Notice that the pre-calculated 
number of new links (D di) may only partially be achieved. 

Results 

Our first observation is that, albeit the aggregate behavior remains dependent on the network density in endogenous networks 
as well, a completely novel type of behavior emerges for middle-density interaction topologies. As demonstrated on Fig. 3, 
the system shows the expected behavior for sparsely and densely connected networks. The aggregate difference between the 
choices  oscillates  around  0  in  the  former  case,  while  it  converges  to  almost  1  or  -1  (i.e.,  each  agent  chooses  one  of  the 
alternatives) in the latter. However, for a  middle-range of  densities the aggregate  measure displays  monumental  swings. It 
first approaches one extreme (i.e., almost all agents opt for one alternative), but then, all of a sudden, the consensus breaks 
down, only to be quickly reached again – at the opposite end of the aggregate choice spectrum. The shifts are typically rather 
abrupt,  albeit  it  is  clear  that  the  system  goes  through  an  almost  continuous  transition.  That  is,  the  new  consensus  is  built 
around a few dissenters, whose influence manifests quickly. 
This type of ‘cycling’ is completely missing from the dybamics observed on static networks, but is not unkown in the real-
world. For example, many large cities went through similar cycles, when a large percentage of their population first moved 
out  to  the  suburbs  in  the  hope  of  a  more  peaceful  life,  only  to  migrate  back  once  the  commuting  time  was  drastically 
increased by implied traffic jams. Naturally, it is not our intention to claim that our model offers an explanation for such real-
world events. Yet, the latters’ existence backs the feasibility of the observed behavior. 
Fig. 4 analyses, in the middle-density range (density=3), how this cycling behavior depends on the threshold parameter (T) 
introduced in the definition of network dynamics. It is visible that positive feedback alone (i.e., when links to similar-minded 
agents are sought, T=0) is not enough for the occurrence of the phenomenon. On the other hand, pure negative feedback (i.e., 
when  links  to  agents  with  the  same  opinion  are  constantly  being  dropped,  T=1)  does  produce  global  shifts,  albeit  rather 
rarely. Also, the transition is less abrupt, and the convergence is to lower values of consensus. Nonetheless, ‘cycling’ is most 
pronounced when both positive and negative feedback is applied, e.g., for T=0.5. 

Related Works 

A  vast  and  growing  body  of  literature  is  dedicated  to  networks,  be  them  social,  man-made  or  other  real-world  networks. 
Many of these works deal with abstract models that attempt to capture one or the other property of observed networks. See 
(Newman 2003) for a review. Similarly, many papers deal with opinion dynamics and their abstract models and the same is 
also  true  for  discrete  choices.  (Hegselmann  and  Krause,  2002)  (Ben-Akiva  and  Lerman  1985)  (Brock  and  Durlauf  2001) 
Previous works from the authors connected the latter series of papers to those dealing with networks. (Gulyás and Dugundji 
2003a, 2003b; Dugundji and Gulyás 2004a, 2004b, 2005, 2006) 
On the other hand, only a few  works  have dealt  with endogenous network dynamics. For example, (Pujol et al. 2005) and 
(Jin,  Girvan  and  Newman  2001)  introduce  models  of  evolving  networks,  while  (Takács  and  Janky  2006)  apply  a  game 
theoretical approach to changing networks in the context of collective action. 
However, we are not aware of any work that links discrete choice dynamics to endogenous network formation. 

Conclusions and Future Works 

In this paper, we extended earlier results concerning discrete choices on networks by considering the endogenous dynamics 
of the underlying social networks. In particular, we studied a model that starts with interaction topologies belonging to the 
Erdős-Rényi class, where the behavior adopted by the agents feeds back to the underlying network structure. (E.g., a decision 
to commute by train instead of car increases the likelihood of train-choosing acquaintances.)  
Our main observation is that the feedback-based endogenous network dynamics introduces a novel, third phase of aggregate 
behavior with monumental swings. For connected, but relatively low-density networks, the aggregate choice first approaches 
one extreme (i.e., almost all agents opt for one alternative), but then, all of a sudden, the consensus breaks down, only to be 
quickly reached again – at the opposite end of the aggregate choice spectrum. 
This paper reported on the first set of results obtained via computational multi-agent based simulations. Future works include 
a  more  detailed  analysis  of  our  findings  at  greater  length.  In  particular,  we  intend  to  analyze  the  size-dependency  of  the 
observed ’cycling’ behavior. Moreover, we plan to perform an in-detail analysis of the mechanics of the abrupt shifts in the 
observed novel phase. A structural analysis of the networks emerging from the model is also planned. Finally, we intend to 
relax the initial condition that prescribes random initial networks that are unrelated to the, also random, initial choices of the 
agents.

ABSTRACT:    Detailed  tropospheric  ion  measurements  are  needed  to  improve  understanding  of  the  electrical 
microphysics affecting clouds. Additionally, atmospheric ion mobility spectra can be used to identify ion growth 
processes leading to condensation nucleus formation. However these measurements are rare, particularly in the 
troposphere where the majority of clouds form. Developments in the operating theory of the classical instrument 
for  ion  measurement,  the  aspirated  cylindrical  capacitor,  are  described,  which  enable  ion  mobility  spectrum 
information to be extracted from the rate of voltage decay of the aspirated capacitor in air. In this paper, data 
from  historical  balloon-borne  ion  counter  ascents  will  be  reanalysed  to  extract  new  ion  mobility  spectra  from 
simple voltage time series. Such data recovery will increase the amount of atmospheric ion spectra available for 
analysis. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Atmospheric ions are one source of atmospheric aerosol particles. If, as has been proposed, particles formed 
from  ions  can  influence  cloud  formation  under  some  conditions  [Yu  and  Turco,  2001],  atmospheric  ion 
measurements  may  reveal  unique  data  on  atmospheric  electrical  influences  on  clouds  and  climate.  Although 
long-term  observations  of  ion  spectra  exist  at  the  surface  [Hõrrak  et  al,  2000],  data  is  very  limited  in  cloud-
forming regions. Free tropospheric ion spectra usually require a dedicated mass spectrometer, flown on a plane 
[Arnold et al, 1998]. 
 
The ventilated cylindrical capacitor or Gerdien condenser [Gerdien, 1905] is a long-established instrument 
for  atmospheric  ion  measurements.  It  consists  of  a  cylindrical  outer  electrode  containing  a  coaxial  central 
electrode,  with  a  fan  to  draw  air  through  the  electrodes.  With  an  appropriate  bias  voltage  applied  across  the 
electrodes,  a  current  flows  in  proportion  to  the  ion  concentration.  The  conductivity  of  the  air  can  be  inferred 
from the rate of decay of voltage across the electrodes. For surface measurements, this technique has generally 
been superseded by direct measurements of the current at the central electrode. Contemporary instruments based 
on  this  principle  deploy  modern  electronics  and  computer  control  to  use  both  the  Current  Measurement  and 
Voltage Decay modes for self-calibration [Aplin and Harrison, 2000; 2001]. However the Voltage Decay mode 
still  remains  preferable  for  balloon-borne  atmospheric  ion  instrumentation  due  to  its  simplicity  in  operation, 
measurement and telemetry. 
 
Surface  measurements  with  modern  instrumentation  showed  that  although  generally  comparable,  the  two 
modes were not always completely consistent [Aplin and Harrison, 2001]. This motivated reconsideration of the 
classical  principles  of  the  Voltage  Decay  mode.  The  modified  approach  enables  ion  mobility  spectra  to  be 
retrieved from voltage decay measurements. In this paper, the new technique is applied to calculate ion mobility 
spectra from historic conductivity-sonde data. 

 

CLASSICAL THEORY 
 
Atmospheric conductivity σ is related to both the atmospheric ion concentration n, and the average mobility 
µ  of  the  air  ion  population.  Molecular  ions  with µ  >  0.5  cm2V-1s-1  are  defined  as  “small  ions”  [Hõrrak  et  al, 
2000]. σ can be written as

Eq 2 

Typical surface σ~5-100fSm-1 depending on aerosol pollution levels. Atmospheric ionisation is caused primarily 
by cosmic rays, though near the surface local radioactivity dominates. The increase in cosmic ray ionisation and 
ion mean free path with decreasing atmospheric pressure cause n, µ  and σ  to rise with height. There is also a 
latitudinal and solar cycle variation in σ due to the varying penetration of cosmic rays into the atmosphere.  
 
For a classical Gerdien condenser in Current Measurement mode, if the ions reaching the central electrode 
are  constantly  replenished,  σ is  proportional  to  the  ion  current  measured  at  the  central  electrode.  (The 
“conductivity measurement régime” requires an adequate ventilation speed and bias voltage, and can be verified 
by  a  linear  response of  measured  current  to  a  changing bias  voltage). Using  Eq 1,  and  considering  the  charge 

arriving at the central electrode per unit time results in the routinely-used equation for calculating σ from current 
measurements  with  a  Gerdien  condenser,  considered  as  a  classical  capacitor  with  capacitance  C  [e.g. 
MacGorman and Rust, 1998].

In the Voltage Decay mode, a voltage across the electrodes will decay due to the current i flowing through 

 
the air, which has a large resistance R. If the charge on the capacitor is Q, elementary circuit analysis gives 
 

Eq 4 

from which the familiar expression for the exponential decay of charge from a capacitor is derived. From this, 
the σ measured by a Gerdien condenser in Voltage Decay mode is inversely related to the time constant τ of the 
decay 
 

Eq 5 

Eq 5 has been the standard expression for calculating σ from voltage decay measurements throughout the history 
of  the  Gerdien  condenser  instrument,  using  τ  determined  from  a  time  series  of  voltage  measurements  [e.g. 
Swann,  1914;  Aplin  and  Harrison,  2000].  Eq  4  assumes  that  the  resistance  of  air  is  constant,  to  give  an 
exponential  rate  of  decay  of  charge  from  a  Gerdien  condenser.  However,  measurements  show  that  a  non-
exponential  decay  rate  is  commonly  observed  [Venkiteshwaran,  1958;  Aplin,  2000],  suggesting  this 
approximation may not be universally appropriate. 
 
MODIFICATION TO CLASSICAL MOBILITY SPECTRUM THEORY  
 
The minimum mobility of ion contributing to σ measurement, the critical mobility µc, [e.g. MacGorman and 
Rust, 1998] is usually approximated from the ventilation speed through a Gerdien condenser u, its length L and 
the bias voltage V:  
 

Eq 6 

c =µ

ku
V

. 

where k is a constant related to the dimensions of the Gerdien condenser [e.g. MacGorman and Rust, 1998]. The 
functional  dependence  of µc  on  the  bias  voltage  can  be  exploited  to  compute  ion  mobility  spectra  from  the 
changing ion current at the central electrode [e.g. Dhanorkar and Kamra, 1993].  
 
During a Voltage Decay measurement the voltage across the electrodes decreases; from Eq 6, µc also varies 
during  the  decay.  The  number  of  ions  contributing  to  the  measurement  therefore  changes  as  a  function  of  the 
decay  voltage.  This  is  identical  to  voltage  decay  through  a  voltage-dependent  resistor  R(V)  in  a  parallel  RC 
circuit, and Eq 4 can be rewritten to include this,

Eq 8 

 
R(V) and the shape of the decay curve are related to the shape of the ion mobility spectrum. If all ions have 
the same mobility (referred to here as a flat ion mobility spectrum) R(V) is constant during the decay and Eq 8 
reduces to Eq 5, the classical exponential decay. For all other spectra, (here called variable ion spectra), R(V) is 
not constant and there is no theoretical basis on which expect an exponential decay. This is the general case in 
the atmosphere [Hõrrak et al, 2000]. 
 
The  voltage  decays  expected  from  prescribed  atmospheric  ion  mobility  spectra  can  be  calculated  by 
numerical  integration  of  Eq  8.  The  simplest  ion  spectrum  is  flat  (Figure  1a).  As  the  number  of  ions  in  each 
mobility category is constant, the effective resistance does not change during the decay, and the voltage decay is 
exponential  (Figure  1b).  Another  simple  shape  of  mobility  spectrum  is  based  on  existing  average  ion  spectra 
[Hõrrak et al, 2000]. (Figure 1c). The voltage decay from this spectrum (Figure 1d) is not exactly exponential, 
with  only  73%  of  its  variance  explained  by  an  exponential  model.  A  typical  voltage  decay  time  series  in 
atmospheric  air  would  only  yield  an  exponential  decay  to  a  first  approximation.  The  difference  from  the 
exponential decay is related to the shape of the spectrum; therefore, voltage decays contain spectral information, 
which can be obtained using a suitable inversion technique [Aplin, 2003].

FREE TROPOSPHERIC ION SPECTRA FROM VOLTAGE DECAY MEASUREMENTS 
At the surface, the effect of the ion mobility spectrum on the shape of the voltage decay may be difficult to 
 
distinguish  from  other  sources  of  variability.  Effects  such  as  turbulence  and  deposition  of  charged  aerosol 
particles on the electrodes can contribute towards a non-exponential decay [Aplin, 2000]. In the free troposphere, 
where aerosol concentrations are minimal,  non-exponential decays have also been observed  [Venkiteshwaran, 
1958]  for  which  there  are  fewer  obvious  explanations.  Free  tropospheric  voltage  decay  measurements  have 
therefore been selected for inversion here, as the deviations of the decays from the exponential are more likely to 
be due to true spectral variations. 
 
Data from historic conductivity-sonde ascents is usually presented as conductivity as a function of altitude 
(Eq 5), with the “raw” voltage decays rarely shown. However Venkiteshwaran [1958] showed the raw decays, 
suitable for inversion. A modified radiosonde carrying a Gerdien condenser measured three decays at 200, 250 
and 300 mbar on 3 February 1958 (corresponding to a mid- to upper troposphere altitude of 9-10km) over Pune, 
India. The critical mobility of the instrument was estimated from its dimensions, and a flow rate of 3ms-1 was 
assumed.  To  calculate  the  spectrum  reduced  mobility  was  used,  as  is  customary,  to  permit  comparison  of  ion 
species at different heights [e.g. MacGorman and Rust, 1998].   
 
The ion spectrum was was calculated by a numerical solution of Eq 8 applied to the digitised voltage decay 
data.  The total ion concentration n was estimated by integrating the area under the ion mobility spectrum to be 
n~3900  cm-3,  increasing  with  height,  as  would  be  expected.  The  absolute  value  of  n  can  be  verified  if  the 
ionisation rate q is known, as the free tropospheric ion concentration n is limited solely by self-recombination 
with coefficient α 
 

Eq 9 

n =

q
α

 

Gringel et al [1986] give q at a geomagnetic latitude (GL) of 36 °N in 1958 as 20cm-3s-1 at 10km. As the air over 
Pune experienced similar energy cosmic ray penetration (GL ~ 30°N) then it is legitimate to estimate n from Eq 

9.  n  ~  4000  cm-3,  indicating  that  the  integrated  value  of  n  is  roughly  correct.  The  reduced  mobility  was 
normalised using typical σ [Gringel et al, 1986] and the calculated n, to reduce the error from the estimates made 
in the mobility calculation. The calculated ion spectrum is shown in Figure 2.  
  
Unfortunately no tropospheric ion mobility spectra have yet been found in the literature for comparison, but this 
spectrum  shows  qualitative  agreement  with  surface  and  stratospheric  ion  spectra.  For  example,  the  300mbar

cloud  at  250  mbar,  which  is  consistent  with  the  peak  in  larger  (lower  mobility)  ions  unique  to  the  250mbar

CONCLUSION 
The  physical  principles  of  the  Gerdien  condenser  have  been  reconsidered,  and  the  classical  theory 
 
modified to take account of the effect of ion spectrum variations. This has permitted inversion of historic σ  data. 
Three  tropospheric  ion  spectra  have  been  calculated  which  are  consistent  with  other  measured  ion  mobility 
spectra. Further historic (and contemporary, if available) voltage decay data are clearly needed for corroboration. 
An  atmospheric  measurement  campaign  would  be  desirable  to  further  establish  this  method,  and,  ultimately, 
determine the role of atmospheric small ions in cloud condensation nucleii formation.

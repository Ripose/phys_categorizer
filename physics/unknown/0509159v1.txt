Abstract 

Although  relativistic  electrodynamics  is  more  than  100  year  old,  there  is  one 
neglected  topic  in  its  presentation  and  application:  relativistic  transformations  of 
electromagnetic  integrals.  Whereas  in  theoretical  and  applied  electrodynamics  electric 
and  magnetic  fields  are  mainly expressed in terms of integrals over charge and current 
distributions,  relativistic  transformations  are  traditionally  applied  to  point  charges  and 
elementary currents. The purpose of this paper is to show that relativistic transformations 
can be easily applied to electromagnetic integrals and that relativistic transformation of 
such  integrals  constitutes  a  valuable  method  for  solving  a  variety  of  electromagnetic 
problems  involving  moving  electromagnetic  system.  Six  illustrative  examples  on 
relativistic  transformation  of  electromagnetic  integrals,  including  transformation  of 
Maxwell(cid:146)s equations in their integral form, are presented in this paper.  

 

 
 
 
I. Introduction 
 
 
Relativistic  transformations  of  electromagnetic  quantities  is  an  important  element  of 
relativistic  electrodynamics.  However,  in  standard  presentations  of  relativistic  electrodynamics 
such  transformations  are  limited  to  electromagnetic  quantities  associated  with  (cid:147)relativistic 
particles,(cid:148) which are usually rapidly moving point charges. On the other hand, electromagnetic 
theory  deals  mostly  with  electric  and  magnetic  fields  associated  with  charge  and  current 
distributions.  These  fields  are  usually  expressed  in  terms  of  electromagnetic  integrals.  Quite 
clearly,  manipulating  electromagnetic  integrals  by  means  of  relativistic  transformations  should 
be  a  useful  extension  of  relativistic  electrodynamics  and  should  be  preferably  included  in 
standard courses on relativistic electromagnetism.  

This  paper  introduces  six  illustrative  examples  on  relativistic  transformations  of 
electromagnetic integrals. In all six examples two inertial reference frames are used: a stationary 
reference  frame  Σ  ((cid:147)laboratory(cid:148)),  represented  by  the  Cartesian  axes  x,  y,  z,  and  an  inertial 
reference  frame  Σ′,  represented  by  the  Cartesian  axes  x′,  y′,  z′,  moving  with  velocity  v  =  vi 
relative to Σ in the positive direction of their common x, x′ axis.

II. Illustrative examples on relativistic transformation of electromagnetic integrals

Example 1.  The  electric  scalar  potential  of  a  stationary  charge  distribution  ρ  is

Using relativistic transformation equations, convert Eq. (1) into the integral for the magnetic vector 
potential produced by a charge distribution moving with constant velocity v = v i. 

Let  a  charge  distribution  ρ′  be  at  rest  in  the  moving  reference  frame  Σ′.  The  electric 
potential φ′ produced by ρ′ in this reference frame is given by Eq. (1) with φ, ρ, r, and dV replaced 
by the corresponding primed quantities:

Observed  from  the  laboratory  (reference  frame  Σ),  the  charge  distribution  ρ′  moves  with 
velocity v along a line parallel to the x axis. Like all moving charges, it creates a magnetic field. To 
find  the  associated  magnetic  vector  potential,  we  transform  Eq.  (2)  by  using  appropriate 
transformation  equations  listed  in  the  Appendix  (these  equations  are  identified  by  the  prefix 
(cid:147)A(cid:148)). However, first we express r′ and dV′ appearing in Eq. (2) in terms of x′, y′, and z′:

Applying  relativistic  transformation  equations  to  Eq.  (12),  find  the  magnetic  field  produced  by  a

As in the preceding example, let a charge distribution ρ′ be at rest in the moving reference 
 
frame Σ′. Rewriting Eq. (12) in terms of its Cartesian components and prime coordinates, we have 
for the electric field produced by ρ′ in Σ′

For  the  time  of  observation  in  the  laboratory  we  chose  as  before  t  =  0,  so  that  Eq.  (4) 
applies again. Also, since there is no current in Σ′, Eq. (5) applies. By Eqs. (A8)-(A10) (noting that 
there is no magnetic field in Σ′ where the charge is stationary) we have

Except for the primes, Eq. (65) is the same as Eq. (55). Hence Eq. (55) is invariant under 

relativistic transformations. 
 
 
III. Discussion 
 
 
Examples  1  and  2  show  the  remarkable  power  and  utility  of  relativistic  transformation 
equations.  One  cannot  help  but  to  be  impressed  by  the  fact  that  applying  relativistic 
transformations to equations for the electrostatic potential and field we obtain equations for the 
magnetic  vector  potential  and  field,2  although  at  first  sight  there  appears  to  be  no  connection 
whatsoever  between  electrostatic  and  magnetic  quantities.  Of  course,  the  primary  purpose  of 
these  examples  in  this  paper  was  to  demonstrate  relativistic  operations  with  electromagnetic 
integrals, and the  very impressive  outcome  of these examples should not obscure their primary 
purpose. Still,  one cannot  ignore  the fact that  obtaining  the  integrals for the magnetic potential 
and field without using relativistic transformations is a rather difficult process.3, 4

Examples 3-4, although not quite so impressive as Examples 1 and 2, are nevertheless of 
considerable significance. The reader has undoubtedly noticed that Eqs. (24), (35), (44), and (55) 
are Maxwell(cid:146)s equations in their integral form. In Einstein(cid:146)s famous 1905 paper5 and in all early 
publications  on  relativistic  electrodynamics,  only  the  invariance  of  the  differential  form  of 
Maxwell(cid:146)s equations under relativistic transformations was discussed or demonstrated. As far as 
this  author  knows,  all  later  and  the  most  recent  publications6  on  relativistic  electromagnetism 
have adhered to this custom. As a result, the students of relativistic electromagnetism receive an 
unavoidable  impression  that  relativistic  transformations  do  not  work  with  equations  involving 
integrals,  and,  in  particular,  are  not  applicable  to  the  integral  form  of  Maxwell(cid:146)s  equation. 
However,  as  it  is  shown  in this paper,  relativistic transformations  work not only perfectly well 
with electromagnetic integrals, but yield very gratifying results specifically when applied to such 
integrals.

References and Remarks 

 
Since  Eq.  (A35)  holds  for  any  surface  of  integration,  the  integrand  in  it  is zero. And since the 
integrand is a vector, all its Cartesian components are zero. For the x component of the integrand 
we then have 
 

 
1.  One  may  think  that  since  the  values  of  φ′,  ρ′  and  r′  in  Σ′  correspond  to  some  time  of 
observation  t′  =  constant,  they  cannot  be  transformed  to  t  =  constant  in  Σ  by  Lorentz 
transformations, and therefore using t = 0 in Σ is in violation of the theory of relativity. However, 
by the principle of relativity, if a physical law does not depend on time in one inertial reference 
frame,  then  it  (or  its  equivalent)  cannot  depend  on  time  in  any  other  inertial  reference  frame. 
Moreover,  if  a  quantity  does  not  explicitly  appear  in  the  formula  under  consideration,  it  is  not 
subject  to  Lorentz  transformation  in  the  course  of  transforming  this  formula  to  a  different 
reference frame. Therefore, since Eq. (2) in Σ′ is time-independent, and since t does not appear in 
Eq. (2) (the time of observation in Σ′ in unspecified), we are free to choose any convenient time 
of observation in Σ. Similarly, since the actual volume of integration in Eq. (2) in Σ′ is arbitrary 

15 

(as long as it encloses the charge distribution under consideration), we need not transform it to 
some  particular  volume  in  Σ:  More  generally,  if  the  domain  of  integration  (volume,  surface, 
contour) in one inertial reference frame is unspecified, it is not subject to Lorentz transformation 
in the course of transforming the corresponding integral to a different reference frame.

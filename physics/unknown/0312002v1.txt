Abstract

A  new  approach  is  introduced  for  calculating  the  spectral  shifts  of  the  most  bathochromic

π

π*→

 transition of an aromatic chromophore in apolar environments. As an example, peryl-

ene in solid and liquid n-alkane matrices was chosen, and all shifts are calculated relative to one

well-defined solid-inclusion system. It is shown that a simple two-level treatment of the solute

using Hückel theory yields spectral shifts in excellent agreement with experimental results for

the most prominent inclusion sites of perylene in solid n-alkane surroundings and for the dilute

solutions in liquid n-alkanes. The idea is general enough to be applied to any aromatic chromo-

phore in a nonpolar solvent matrix. In contrast to earlier treatments, this approach is based on

geometry-dependent polarizabilities, employs a 

 dependence for the dispersion energy, is

r 4–

conceptually simple and computationally efficient. Different simple models based on our gen-

eral approach to compute the UV spectral shifts due to solvation indicate that the dispersive part

of the van-der-Waals energy, which stabilizes the LUMO of perylene more than the HOMO,

falls off with a distance dependence of 

 in a range up to ~1 nm and not as 

, as has been

1/r6

1/r4

assumed for a long time. This finding corresponds to the interpretation of temporary dipoles as

being equivalent to weak permanent dipoles with fluctuating orientation.

1. Introduction

A solvent-induced UV/Vis spectral red shift is due to the lowering of the transition energy be-

tween the ground and the excited state of a chromophore, caused by interactions of the chromo-

phore-bearing (solute) molecule with the solvent molecules. We restrict ourselves to the case of

π*→

 transitions of aromatic chromophores in nonpolar solvents, in which permanent elec-
π
trostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding are absent1 and where, therefore, the predominant

interaction is dispersive. For the shifts in UV spectra of aromatic chromophores, environments
of noble gases,2-6 of alkanes,7-10 and of polymeric nonpolar media1 have been the primary tar-
gets in previous studies; several models have been proposed,2-6, 11-15 and considerable experi-
mental  data,  mostly  on  chromophores  in  alkane  crystals,  have  been  collected.2-4,  16-24

Nevertheless, the theoretical concepts are far from simple and the concomitant computational

approaches are difficult.

If we consider just one solvent unit, which may be a single atom in the simplest case, this unit

is interacting with the dye molecule in its ground state and (after excitation) in its excited state.

The only difference between the two states is the promotion of one electron from the HOMO

into the LUMO. Since we consider a single electron to be promoted, the only possible cause for

the spectral red shift must be a solvent-induced change in the dispersive interaction of this elec-

tron with the solvent unit that cannot be the same for the HOMO and the LUMO, since other-

wise  they  would  cancel.  Since  the  direction  of  the  spectral  shift  is  always  towards  lower

energies and dispersive energies are always stabilizing, we conclude that the electron in its ex-

cited state (LUMO) has a stronger dispersive interaction with the solvent unit than in the ground

state (HOMO). It is often assumed that this is due to a higher diffusivity of the electron density

within the LUMO; this idea is at the heart of the present treatment and is represented in Figure

1. The spectral shift,

2. Critical Review on Calculations of Dispersive Interactions with 

Perturbation Theory

The earliest approach for the calculation of UV/Vis spectral shifts is that of Longuet-Higgins
and Pople,12 who used time-independent perturbation theory for the description of dispersive
interactions. Shalev et. al.3 extended this work. The dispersive energy arises from fluctuating

dipole moments of the otherwise nonpolar molecules. This temporary dipole-dipole interaction

energy is contained in the perturbation Hamiltonian, 

. Assuming point-like atom-based di-

poles, their pair-wise interaction energy varies like 

, where 

r

 is the distance between the

H′
r 3–

centers of the two dipoles. In fact, this interaction energy depends on the orientation of the two

dipoles at small and medium distances and converges to an 
 distance dependence when the
distance is ~6 times the dipole length or more.25, 26 In either case the first order correction to

is zero because the expectation values of the dipole moment operators in 

H′

 are zero for non-

polar atoms in their ground state. The second order correction to the energy, when both atoms

are in the ground state, is given by

However, as we pointed out, the dipole-dipole energy falls off as 

r 6–

 at long ranges26 so that

perturbation theory actually yields a strange 

 distance dependence by the same procedure.

r 12–

Therefore, perturbation theory might not be a suitable approach to calculate such energies. Eq

3 or similar expressions relate to the dispersive energy between two atoms. The same approach

can be used to obtain the dispersive energy of molecules, but the entire chromophore has to be

considered instead of atom A and a solvent unit in the place of atom B. For the chromophore,

the total wave function is split into a linear combination of all atomic orbitals although this dis-

connects the included atoms. For the solvent, quasi-spherical entities with an “atomic” wave

function are considered, e. g., a methyl group or a methylene group. The spectral shift from eq

1 with the two dispersion energies from the excited state i and the ground state 0 of the solute

molecule A, assuming the perturbation approach, is:

This is the spectral shift caused by one solvent unit B; to obtain the total spectral shift, one must

add the contributions of all solvent units.

If eq 4 is implemented, the following needs to be considered: (1) The distance dependence for

intermediate-range  intermolecular  interactions  is  better  approximated  by  an 

  dependence

than by one that goes as 

 (London’s formula). Also, the obtained 

 distance dependence

r 6–

r 4–

5 of 25

with perturbation theory is quite arbitrary, as discussed above. Some theories are based on the
r 6–
 dependence for long-range dispersive interactions2, 4, 5, 10, 12 but are, generally speaking,

not very accurate. An 
termediate range interactions.1, 6, 8, 28 In what follows, we will also assume that an 

 dependence has been shown several times to better represent the in-

 depend-

r 4–

r 4–

ence is better (trials of the methods described in section 5 with an 
 dependence yield less
satisfactory results). (2) By inserting the LCAO expansion of a complex chromophore3, 6 into

r 6–

the perturbation expression eq 4, one explicitly considers only two-atom interactions (the treat-

ment was initially formulated for the interaction of two atoms). However, an aromatic chromo-

phore  has  delocalized 

π

  electrons,  the  polarizability  of  which  is  strongly  anisotropic  and

dependent on the environment. The delocalization of the electrons between the atoms or the ex-

istence of nodal planes are not considered. (3) The evaluation of eq 4 then yields 
 terms in
the summation,3 when n is the number of terms in the LCAO expansion — all the two-body in-

n4

teractions,  which  incorporate  one  solute  atom  and  the  solvent  unit,  and,  in  addition,  a  large
number of three-body interactions,3, 6 which incorporate all possible pairs of atoms in the solute

molecule plus the solvent unit. The two-body terms are proportional to the square of the orbital

coefficient on one solute atom, i.e., to the local electron density. The three-body terms have no

explicit physical meaning because they contain products of orbital coefficients at two solute at-

oms in all combinations, each of them belonging to a different state, and somewhat arbitrary ge-
ometry  factors.3  These  three-body  terms  constitute  an  essential  part  in  this  approach,  even
though a physical justification has never been given.1, 3, 6, 8 (4) The evaluation of the matrix el-

ements in eq 4 with appropiate electrostatic potentials is almost impossible, especially consid-

ering  the  numerous  two-body  and  three-body  terms  arising  out  of  the  LCAO  expansion.  A

simple two-atom interaction with 

 terms instead of 

 (see Section 3.5.2) gives results of the

n1

n4

same precision. (5) From the computational point of view, the perturbation approach is not ef-

ficient. For a chromophore such as perylene, for instance, 92 states are included in the LCAO
expansion and all of them are, in principle, used in the calculations. Overall, more than 106
terms in the perturbation summation eq 4 must then be computed per solvent unit3, 6 whereas

our method featured below requires only 40 terms per solvent unit and is more accurate (see Ta-

ble 4).

In conclusion, the approach of Shalev and Jortner et. al.3 can hardly be recommended because

an excessive number of matrix elements in eq 4 is required, which are of uncertain physical

meaning and evaluated with several arbitrary scalings, as well as an 

 distance dependence

of the dispersive energy (see the details in ref. 3). The underlying concept in perturbation theory

that the (dispersive) interaction energy is summed over any possible combinations of states of

each of the two atoms is only a postulate. We evaluate the dispersive energies in eq 4 in a direct

way (see below): using an 

 distance dependence of the dispersive energy and employing ex-

r 4–

plicit polarizabilities at the locations of measurable electron density, taking into account the

shape of the electron clouds (which is not the case with perturbation approaches). A justification

may be as follows. As a direct consequence of the Coulomb-law, we obtain an 

 distance de-

length) and an

 distance dependence between two permanent dipoles at long distances (dis-

as two weak permanent dipoles, the interaction energy in a medium distance range might be pro-

portional to 

r 4–

 so that

Some other methods are based on “single-center” molecular polarizabilities,2, 4 which are even
simpler and computationally less demanding. With such an approach, Adams and Stratt4, 5 have

obtained good results for benzene approximated as a spherically-symmetric solute. However,

this approach cannot be generalized for molecules of less symmetry, and the precision becomes

considerably smaller.

3. Systems Considered and Methods Employed

3.1. The Chromophore-alkane System

The systems considered here are (1) inclusion sites of perylene in solid n-alkanes, and (2) dilute

solutions of perylene in liquid n-alkanes.

, at all other atoms they are obtained by symmetry. Their relative signs can be derived from

to

the MO pictures in Figure 3. The LUMO coefficients are multiplied with a factor x to account

for the increased polarizability of the electrons in the excited state (see text).

(1) In solid n-hexane, a perylene molecule (see Figure 2) can be inserted into the lattice by re-

placing two alkane molecules so that the molecular plane of perylene is either parallel to the bc
or to the ab plane of the crystal axis system.1 If it is parallel to the bc plane, the long axis of

perylene has two possible orientations: it can be parallel to the long axis (b axis) of the lattice,

corresponding to inclusion “site 1”, or rotated against it by 60°, corresponding to the inclusion

“site 2”. If it is parallel to the ab plane, the long axis of perylene is parallel to the b axis, yielding
inclusion “site 3”.1 These sites are very well defined in the total luminescence spectra (TLS, see
Section 3.3). Leontidis et al.9 have shown that for higher n-alkanes, inclusion site 1 exists and

corresponds to a sharp, intense peak in the TL spectrum, but that there are no clearly identified

arrangements corresponding to sites 2 and 3; instead, we find an ill-defined inclusion site with

a considerably lower spectral shift and only a weak structural analogy to site 3. We employ the

well-defined sites, the three sites in n-hexane and sites 1 of n-heptane to n-nonane to test the

model developed.

(2) In solution, the molecular environment of any molecule is relatively vaguely defined. We

consider the spectral shift of perylene in dilute solutions of n-alkanes with 6 to 10 carbon atoms,

estimated from a number of thermalized snap-shots for every system and compared to experi-

mental values (see Section 3.3).

3.2. Molecular Modeling 

The Shpol’skii (solid inclusion) systems of perylene in n-alkanes were modeled starting with

crystals defined by periodic boxes of 300 to 400 alkane molecules; room for a single perylene

inclusion was obtained by replacing two or three of the alkane molecules, depending on the spe-
cific  inclusion  site  studied.9  All  molecular  simulations  were  carried  out  with  the  Discover
program8 and the Insight 400 graphic interface. The energy of the generated structures were first

minimized by molecular mechanics, then the solid was equilibrated by NVT molecular dynam-

ics for about 40 ps (time step 1 fs, Verlet’s integrator, temperature control by velocity scaling).

During the next 50 ps, 100 snapshots were collected and for each of them, the spectral shift for

perylene estimated. The final values are the averages of those spectral shifts.

The dilute solution systems were constructed by placing 60 n-alkane molecules and one peryl-

ene molecule in a cubic cell with the overall density of the liquid n-alkane at 300 K and 1 bar.

After energy minimization, the system was exposed to NVT and NpT molecular dynamics for

600 to 1000 ps, and during the next 200 ps, 100 snapshots are taken to calculate the spectral

shifts (for the NpT simulations, Andersen’s manostat was used with a cell mass of 100 and a

pressure of 0.16 GPa to maintain the density). During the sampling interval, the molecules on

average diffuse about three to six times the box edge length; the calculated shifts for each snap-

shot are not noticeably correlated. The spectral shifts obtained through NpT and NVT simula-

tion are not significantly different.

3.3. Experimental

The spectral shifts for the solid inclusion sites, measured with total luminescence spectroscopy
(TLS), have all been taken from the literature.8, 19, 23, 24, 29 The spectral shifts in the dilute al-

kane solutions were measured using a LAMBDA 9 Perkin-Elmer UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer
with a slit width of 0.5 nm. The solutions had a concentration of about 1.5 · 10-4 M. At this con-

centration we assume that 
perylene molecules do not frequently occur.14 The results are included in Table 4.

4. The Electronic States

4.1. Aromatic Solute

We  employ  a  standard  semi-empirical  method,  appropriate  for  the  chromophore  in  question
(perylene), such as the Hückel method, Extended Hückel method, MNDO, or AM1.30 From

these we obtain for each electronic state its symmetry, its energy, and its orbital coefficients (the

square of which represents the electron density at each atom). It has to be decided, which elec-

trons exert influence in the excitation process. The wave function of the solute molecule written

as a linear combination of atomic orbitals is

the aromatic molecule.

It is also unlikely that all 

π

 states need to be considered, since we are interested in 

π

 tran-

sitions only. In order to assess the relevance of particular states, the energy spacings of the 

π

orbitals around the HOMO and LUMO need to be examined. For our example of perylene, the

corresponding values are listed in Table 1. Here we assign the relative energy 1.0 to the frontier

orbital transition. Table 1 shows that the energy spacing to the neighboring orbitals is of the

same magnitude, which indicates that to a good approximation we can neglect electronic states

other than the HOMO and LUMO for the transition of concern (interestingly, the different semi-

empirical methods give rather different values!). By considering only the HOMO and LUMO,

the problem is considerably reduced.

The frontier orbitals of perylene are graphically presented in Figure 3. There are nodal planes

along all the principal molecular axes in the HOMO and along two of the principal axes in the

LUMO. Only four different absolute values for the orbital coefficients exist in both states con-

sidered: these values, c1 to c4, are assigned to carbon atoms 1 to 4 in Figure 3. Their signs can
be taken from the symmetries in Figure 3. In the HOMO, we can distinguish between two types

of electron clouds, each spread over two atoms and occurring four times. In the LUMO, there

are three types of electron clouds, two spread over two atoms and one localized on one atom

only (see Figure 3).

Figure 3. HOMO (above) and LUMO (below) of perylene. There are two nodal planes along

the long axis of the molecule. In the HOMO, two differently shaped lobes of electron density

can be found that are spread over two atoms. In the LUMO, three different lobes of electron

clouds are observed; one of them is localized on one atom only. All these lobes occur repeatedly

for symmetry reasons.

Since the semi-empirical methods do not all give the same results, one must be chosen for a par-

ticular piece of work. The four principal orbital coefficients are compared in Table 2. The dif-

ferences between them are not significant, and we found that the particular choice of method

does not change the results of the shift calculations significantly. The Hückel method was cho-

sen for its simplicity and because it has no adjustable parameters.

a In the ground state.

Consider the difference in the electron distribution between the HOMO and LUMO. If the elec-

tron densities, represented by the square of the orbital coefficients, are the same at every atom 

in both states, the polarizabilities should be similar because the polarizability is dependent on 

electron (de)localization. As a result, only a minimal spectral shift would be observed. Because 

there are more nodal planes in the LUMO, which tends to increase electron localization, we 

might even expect the polarizability to diminish upon excitation and the dispersive stabilization 

to be less than in the HOMO, resulting in a positive spectral shift. However, experience shows 

that the reverse is true. The cause is probably that LUMO electrons posses a higher energy and 

are more delocalized than those in the HOMO. This electron mobility must be perpendicular to 

the plane of the aromatic molecule, because horizontally there are more restrictions in space 

caused by the extra nodal planes. Thus the anisotropy of the polarizability increases in the ex-
cited state.31 Excited state polarizabilities are not known locally in larger molecules, and only 
roughly yet for some complete simple molecules.31-35 The simplest way to account for the “dif-

fusivity” of the electrons in the LUMO is to relay on the additional nodal planes. We propose 

to include the cross terms 

 in the normalization of the orbital coefficients,

which will produce negative contributions for nodal areas between connected atoms, thereby in-

creasing the orbital coefficients. The scaling factor x for the orbital coefficients derived from eq

, i.e., in the LUMO the electrons are roughly 42 % more polarizable

). It is interesting that even deviations in this ratio from 1.15 to 1.25 do not alter

the results in a significant manner. The experimentally determined polarizability of the whole
perylene molecule in the excited state is indeed 40 % higher than in the ground state.36 

To sum up, we consider only the 

π

 electrons of the chromophore in the frontier orbitals, using

the simple Hückel-MO scheme. The increased “mobility” of the electrons in the LUMO is esti-

mated with the aid of cross terms including products of the orbital coefficients.

4.2. Solvent

The alkanes in our case are divided into methyl and methylene groups and are treated as quasi-

atoms. This approach works well because the electrons that give rise to dispersive forces are lo-

calized on these groups. Methyl and methylene groups have different polarizabilities (2.22 and
1.84 Å3).37, 38 The effect of a solvent group on the solute molecule transition is then calculated,

and the contributions of each group are independently summed.

5. Computations of Spectral Shifts

For our model case, perylene, the symmetry of the electron distribution in the HOMO and in the

LUMO are first calculated plus the numerical values for the four distinct orbital coefficients.

Bond polarizabilities are then taken from the literature to describe the direction-dependent po-

larizabilities of the various electron clouds in the frontier orbitals. This and the geometry of the

system allow then to compute the dispersive interaction between the electron clouds and the sol-

vent units. This procedure is executed for all relevant electron clouds in the HOMO and LUMO,

yielding the dispersion energies in both electronic states. The desired red shift is finally calcu-

lated using eq 1.

The polarizability tensors for the C=C and the C-C bond are known38 and that of a single p or-

 bond, we estimate the polarizabilities in the direction of the prin-

cipal axes as the difference between those of a double bond and a single bond (see Table 3); the

bond lengths of the two bonds are different (133 vs. 154 pm) and also different from that of an

aromatic bond (141 pm), but calculations with slightly changed values give essentially identical

results (bear in mind that the electron localization description on the basis of the shape of an

ordinary 

π

 bond is already a considerable approximation). The similarity in the values for

cloud with an integral charge density of unity and the same electron density at both atoms, while

a singly occupied

 orbital has the electron density zero at one of the two atoms. A crude ap-

proximation might involve scaling the two atomic polarizability components linearly between

these two extreme cases, using the ratio of the electron densities at the two carbon atoms as a

scaling parameter. The physical justification rests on the fact that the polarizability in a given

direction depends on the electron density; also, this approach avoids introducing new parame-

ters. Hence, assuming that exactly one electron is localized in the cloud, we scale the longitudi-

nal and vertical components of the polarizability of atom i as shown in Figure 4.

 is the angle between the long axis of the electron cloud and the direction vector con-

necting the carbon atom of that cloud and the solvent unit. Explorative calculations with an el-

liptical model for the polarizabilities yielded essentially identical values.

For an electron cloud centered on only one atom, as for perylene atoms 1, 8, 9, and 16 in the

LUMO (see Figure 2 and Figure 3), a singly occupied p orbital with an isotropic polarizability

is used:

In summary, Method A consists of first calculating the two principal polarizability components

or the isotropic polarizability for each atom of perylene, for both, HOMO and LUMO, using

equations 10-13 and eq 15. The total spectral shift arising from all solvent units B is then given

by eq 9, where the summation runs over all perylene carbons i. Carbon atoms 17 to 20 on the

long axis (see Figure 2) can be omitted, since they lie in a nodal plane. The polarizabilities

 for perylene atom i with respect to the solvent unit considered are calcu-

The method outlined above applies to any structure containing perylene and a nonpolar solvent.

We have applied it to two different situations: (1) the Shpol’skii system perylene in solid n-al-

kanes, and (2) dilute solutions of perylene in n-alkanes. Computation results for some promi-
nent  inclusion  sites  of  perylene  in  solid  n-alkane  matrices8  and  in  solution  at  standard

temperature and pressure are displayed in Table 4 together with the experimental values. The

agreement with the measurement data is very good.

In the following sections, the sensitivity of the method towards greater simplifications is exam-

ined.

5.2. Method B: Atom Centered Polarizabilities Only

Consider the spatial extension and the shape of the electron distribution, but only take account

of the local electron densities centered at each atom of the chromophore, summing over explicit

two-atom interactions only in eq 9. The polarizability difference of each carbon atom of the ar-

omatic molecule in the two electronic states is thought to be proportional to that atom’s electron

density only. One can then use the electron density itself, e. g., that for the HOMO, in place of

 because we are using a fitting factor k to match the calculated shift for the

molecule A and all n solvent units B simplifies considerably:

Despite its simplicity, this method gives excellent results, of a precision not significantly lower
than those from the perturbation treatments,8, 9 as can be seen in Table 4.

5.3. Method C: Atom Centered Polarizabilities With an Empirical Geometry Factor

A cumulative polarizability factor might improve Method B. It is based on the following con-

siderations: a solvent unit positioned above the plane of the aromatic molecule will interact with

fewer polarizable electron clouds in the chromophore than if it were located in the plane of the

aromatic molecule. Trying to account for this effect, we suggest an empirical geometric factor,

, where 

γi

 is the angle between the normal to the plane of the perylene molecule and

the distance vector between perylene carbon i and the solvent unit. This factor is equal to 1 if

This formula gives results with somewhat improved precision compared to Method B (see Ta-

ble 4).

Table 4).

5.4. Method D: Four-center Model with Interaction on Both Sides of the Plane

A further simplification begins with Model B (eq 16), but takes into account only the four sym-

metrically distinct carbon atoms of perylene that have the highest electron density. These form

the outer carbons, numbered 1, 8, 9, and 16 (see Figures 2 and 3). Together they account for 40

% of the total electron density and are arranged symmetrically around the central aromatic ring.

This simplification is rather crude, but the values obtained are still of reasonable quality (see

An attempt to refine this model was made taking into account that the p electron clouds of the

chromophore are divided into two enantiomeric parts, below and above the molecular plane,

which have equal polarizabilities but contribute differently to the dispersion energy because

their distance to the particular solvent unit is different. The two parts are displaced by ca. ±60

pm from atom i in the perylene plane, a little less than half the aromatic C–C bond length of 140

pm. This refinement was found not to cause significant changes in the results.

5.5. Method E: Symmetric Electron Clouds

The final simplification involves the assumption that every electron cloud that is distributed

over two carbon atoms be symmetric with respect to the midpoint between these two atoms (as

if the orbital coefficients at both atoms were the same). This is equivalent to modeling the elec-

tron distribution with ordinary 

π

 bonds with lower overall electron density. Furthermore, these

two-center clouds are represented by a single polarizable entity in the middle of the bond. Equa-

tions 10 to 13 simplify to

where i and j denote the two atoms of the cloud. The summation in eq 9 involves fewer terms

since only the mid-points of C-C bonds are considered. For the single atom clouds in the LU-

MO, eq 15 still applies. 

Inspecting the squares of the orbital coefficients at perylene carbon atoms 1 and 2 in the HOMO

(they differ by about one order of magnitude, see Table 2) indicates that this is a severe approx-
imation; indeed, the results thus obtained deviate often more than 50 cm–1 from the experimen-

tal results (see Table 4).

6. Conclusions

We have presented a new, accurate approach to the calculation of solvatochromic UV/Vis spec-

tral shifts of an aromatic molecule in a nonpolar solvent matrix. In the case of perylene, the

π

π*→

 transition can be reduced to HOMO and LUMO and the solely geometry-based de-

scription with Huckel’s theory leads to a precise reproduction of numerous spectral shifts. One

fit parameter is contained, used to reproduce one of the well-understood shifts of that chromo-

phore.  As a general feature, it is striking that only the connectivity of the aromatic carbons en-

ters the estimate of the local electron densities on each aromatic carbon. We take account of the

natural shape of the electron clouds given by the sign of the orbital coefficients, which is miss-

ing in the alternative approaches by perturbation theory. The agreement with the experimental

results is very good, and our method is computationally much less demanding than previous al-

ternatives. The level of simplifications allow one to choose between accuracy and simplicity.

The second achievement of our spectral shift analyses is that the dispersive van-der-Waals en-
1/r4

ergy falls off with a distance dependence of 

 in the distance regime of 300 to 1000 pm,

which is most important for modeling intermolecular interactions. The commonplace 

1/r6

 de-

pendence was tested as well and found not to be appropiate. Hirschfelder, Curtiss, and Bird (p

27/28 in ref. 26) stated that the energy between two permanent electric dipoles at shorter dis-

tances, where their relative orientation is important, may fall off as 
1/r6

 at longer distances. The most influential range of our dispersive intermolecular interac-

, and only approaches

1/r3

tions is between 300 pm and 1000 pm so that (dipole) orientation effects are essential, since

22 of 25

atomic radii or bond lengths have a magnitude around 100 to 200 pm. We may tentatively ex-

plain our detected 

 distance dependence by the presence of weak permanent dipoles in the

1/r4

solid and liquid structures. A further investigation of this finding, e. g., for noble gases, and the

possibility of more accurate parametrizations for complex force fields seem to be an interesting

challenge.

An often used perturbation-theory approach, the SBEJ method3 (see Table 4), fares only rea-

sonably well in solid matrices, and is computationally very demanding. It seems to be less well-

suited for liquid structures, where even our dramatically simplified models, e. g., Model D that

only includes 8 terms per solvent unit in the summation, give better values when compared to

experiment. It must be said, however, that the system-size sensitivity of our results have not yet

been sufficiently explored for liquid systems (in contrast to the crystalline systems considered);

a full investigation of this point would, however, require extensive further calculations. The ad-

vantage of our methods lie in their theoretical simplicity, ease of implementation in a computa-

tional program for a particular system, and efficiency.

Moreover, it would be interesting to expand these ideas to more complicated systems, e. g.,

those with polar constituents or hydrogen bonding.

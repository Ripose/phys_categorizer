  We formulate an algebraic relativistic method of scattering for systems with spatially 
dependent  mass  based  on  the  J-matrix  method.  The  reference  Hamiltonian  is  the  three-
dimensional Dirac Hamiltonian but with a mass that is position-dependent and having a 
constant  asymptotic  limit.  Additionally,  this  effective  mass  distribution  is  locally 
represented in a finite dimensional function subspace. The spinor couples to spherically 
symmetric  vector  and  pseudo  scalar  potentials  that  are  short-range  such  that  they  are 
accurately represented by their matrix elements in the same finite dimensional subspace. 
We calculate the relativistic phase shift as a function of energy for a given configuration 
and study the effect of spatial variation of the mass on the energy resonance structure.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 
 
Calculations of physical quantities relevant to semiconductors are sometimes done 
using  the  effective  mass  approximation.  Initially  this  approximation  has  been  used  to 
describe impurities in crystals [1] where much of the interaction with the host lattice is 
being  parameterized  through  an  effective  mass  parameter  in  the  impurity  Hamiltonian. 
The effective mass is also an important parameter in Landau’s Fermi liquid theory that 
deals  with  low-level  excited  states  of  strongly  interacting  systems  in  a  very  appealing 
single  particle  approximation  [2].  Since  then,  the  effective  mass  approximation  has 
become  an  essential  ingredient  in  describing  the  transport  properties  of  semi-conductor 
hetero-junctions and quantum dots [3]. One of the main features of these hetero-junctions 
or  graded  semiconductors  is  that  the  effective  mass  of  the  charge  carriers  is  position 
dependent and is, frequently, the result of discontinuities across the hetero-junction with 
abrupt interfaces. Thus, one is lead to study quantum mechanical problems with position-
dependent  effective  mass.  However,  such  treatment  encounters  a  nontrivial  problem 
related to ordering ambiguity in the quantization of the momentum and mass operators in 
the kinetic energy term of the effective Hamiltonian. 
 
On  the  other  hand,  relativistic  effects  have  significant  influence  on  the  electronic 
 
properties of materials containing heavy atoms or  those with heavy  ion  doping. This is 
because  the  charge  carriers  in  such  materials  attain  higher  velocities  comparable  to 
lighter ones. Relativistic effects also include spin-orbit and spin-spin couplings which are 
purely relativistic corrections to the nonrelativistic Hamiltonians. Spin-orbit interaction,

in particular, alters the spectroscopic properties of molecules containing heavy elements 
to a considerable extent. Thus the solution of the Dirac equation under the circumstance 
where  the  mass  depends  on  the  position  of  electrons  will  be  of  interest  in  studying 
materials containing heavy elements. 
 
 
The  quantization  of  non-relativistic  Hamiltonians  of  position-dependent  mass 
systems  is  always  hindered  by  ordering  ambiguities  in  the  kinetic  energy  term.  On  the 
other hand its relativistic counterpart, the relativistic Dirac equation, does not suffer from 
such ambiguity. This ordering ambiguity of mass and momentum is due to the fact that 
these two quantities no longer commute when the mass is space dependent. An effective 
approach  towards  the  resolution  of  this  ambiguity  is  to  start  with  the  relativistic  Dirac 
wave  equation,  which  does  not  suffer  from  any  ordering  problem,    then  take  the  non-
21 c .  There  have  been 
relativistic  limit  (which  is  well  defined  and  unique)  up  to  order 
several attempts in defining the correct hermitian kinetic energy operator for a variable 
mass  system  based  on  current  conservation  [3],  Galilean  invariance  [4]  or  the  recent 
supersymmetric  treatment  of  the  effective  mass  Hamiltonians  [5].  We  believe  that  the 
work of Cavalcante et al. [6] is a measurable contribution towards the resolution of the 
ordering  ambiguity  problem  of  the  quantum  kinetic-energy  operator  with  spatially 
varying  effective  mass.    In  our  present  work  we  opted  for  an  algebraic  method  of 
quantum  scattering,  the  J-matrix  method,  to  deal  with  the  scattering  problem  for  space 
dependent  mass  systems.  This  method  will  enable  us  to  obtain  a  highly  accurate 
numerical  solution  of  the  relativistic  scattering  problem  with  space  dependent  mass 
distribution (while avoiding the ordering ambiguity) that is confined to a finite region in 
space but asymptotically constant. 
 
The J-matrix is an algebraic method of quantum scattering developed almost thirty 
 
years ago [7]. The method exploits the fact that the unperturbed reference problem can be 
2
solved analytically in a certain complete set of L
 basis functions. The basis set is chosen 
such  that  the  matrix  representation  of  the  unperturbed  Hamiltonian  is  tridiagonal 
(Jacobian).  This  property  enables  us  to  employ  the  analytical  power  associated  with 
orthogonal  polynomials.  However 
the  reference 
2
  basis  functions  only  to  those  that  allow  for  such  a 
Hamiltonian  restricts  the  type  of  L
these 
tridiagonal 
circumstances, the eigenvalue equation of the reference Hamiltonian gives rise to three-
term  recursion  relation  for  the  expansion  coefficient  of  the  unperturbed  wave  function. 
The short range scattering potential is then confined to an N-box in function space so that 
, where N is some 
its matrix elements are zero outside this box (i.e., 
large enough integer). This approximation provides us with a numerical mean to extract 
the necessary scattering information relevant to the problem at hand. Thus, the J-matrix 
structure in function space parallels that of the R-matrix method in configuration space 
[9]. A relativistic extension of the J-matrix has been proposed by Horodecki [10] for the 
Coulomb  free  interaction  and  by  Alhaidari  et  al.  [11].  It  is  the  purpose  of  the  present 
paper  to  formulate  an  algebraic  relativistic  method  of  potential  scattering  for  systems 
with position dependent mass based on the J-matrix method. 
 
 
The rest of our paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II, we give some preliminaries 
about the 3D Dirac Hamiltonian with position-dependent mass and define our reference 
Hamiltonian. In Sec. III, the J-matrix solution of the reference problem in the asymptotic 
region will be presented. The scattering matrix and associated phase shift are obtained in

and position-dependent mass M(r) where the spinor couples to vector and pseudo-scalar 
potentials. That is, we study the three-dimensional relativistic problem with the following

not  allowed  in  the  kinetic  balance  relation  (6)  used  to  obtain  φ− .  Now,  since

belongs  to  the  negative  energy  spectrum,  then  this  implies  that  the  solution  obtained 
above does not include the negative energy solution of the relativistic problem. To obtain 
this  negative  energy  solution  one  has  to  solve  Eq.  (7)  for  φ−   and  use  the  dual  kinetic

diagonal representation, on the other hand, can only admit discrete eigenenergies that are 
compatible  with  bound  states.  However,  because  the  basis  is  square  integrable  and 
regular everywhere, then a faithful representation in this basis could only be obtained for

hope  to  match  its  behavior  everywhere  using  this  basis.  Nonetheless,  it  is  still  possible

This  expression  shows  that  the  basis  in  this  representation  is  energy-dependent;  a 
property  which  is  not  desirable  from  numerical  point  of  view.  This  is  because  any 
calculation  in  such  a  basis  has  to  be  repeated  for  all  energies  in  the  range  of  interest. 
Nonetheless,  we  will  find  out  shortly  that  this  basis  is  only  necessary  for  the  analytic

The  vector  and  pseudo  scalar  potentials,  V(r)  and  W(r),  are  assumed  short-range 
 
2
such  that  they  are  represented  accurately  by  their  matrix  elements  in  a  finite  set  of  L
 
basis  functions  {
,  for  some  large  enough  integer  N.  The  relativistic  effective 
mass,  S(r),  is  also  localized  accurately  in  the  same  finite  basis.  In  contrast  to  the 
kinematic basis (15) this finite basis, which is evidently a two-component spinor basis, 
should be energy independent. Moreover, it is required to sample the objects defined in 
the interior scattering region (i.e., objects like V, W and S that are short-range) to a high 
degree  of  accuracy.  That  is,  the  following  finite  N×N  matrix  representation  of  the

This representation is the fundamental underlying structure of certain algebraic scattering 
methods,  such  as  the  R-matrix  [9]  and  J-matrix  methods  [7].  One  may  confine 
investigation to the finite N×N matrix representation of the potential V and the reference 
Hamiltonian 
0H .  However,  taking  into  account  the  full  contribution  of  the  reference 
Hamiltonian, as will be done in this work, should result in a substantial improvement on 
the accuracy of the results. Now, if we define the “J-matrix coefficients”

In  the  following  section  we  calculate  the  scattering  phase  shift  for  a  given 
configuration  specified  by  the  choice  of  potential  functions  V(r)  and  W(r)  and  for  an 
effective mass distribution S(r). Taking ρ = 2, the results will be shown to be independent 
of the spinor basis parameter ω once we reach the plateau of computational stability. The 
computer code (RMJ-07.01) used in the calculation was developed using the Mathcad® 
software package, and is available upon request from the corresponding author.

The calculation will be carried out in the Laguerre basis given above in Eq. (46a) and Eq.

S-wave scattering as a function of the energy variable E(ε) defined below Eq. (17c). The 
physical parameters were taken as 
0V = 3.0, and  0r = 3.0 (all in atomic units). Moreover, 
we took a basis size N = 50 and ω = 10 (a.u.). The solid curve is the relativistic result 
corresponding  to  (cid:26) =  0.2  (a.u.)  whereas  the  dashed  curve  corresponds  to  the 
nonrelativistic limit where  (cid:26) = 0.001 (a.u.). That is, for the nonrelativistic limit the speed 
of  light  was  ascribed  a  value  that  is  200  times  larger  than  c.  Now,  as  stated  in  the 
Introduction,  nonrelativistic  position-dependent  mass  systems  have  ordering  ambiguity 
that makes their solution not unique. Consequently, a consistency check of our results (in 
the limit) could only be made by comparison with those of constant mass. Figure 2 is the 
result of the non-relativistic calculation for the same problem with constant mass, which 
was performed using the standard nonrelativistic J-matrix method in the Laguerre basis 
with the same parameters. The agreement between Fig. 2 and the dashed curve in Fig. 1 
is  obvious.  As  expected,  no  significant  differences  exist  at  lower  energies  between  the 
relativistic and nonrelativistic results. However, it is clear that the sharp resonance at the 
higher  energy  E  =  2.2  (a.u.)  in  Fig.  1  becomes,  in  the  nonrelativistic  limit,  less 
pronounced  (broader)  and  shifts  a  little  towards  higher  energy  at  E  =  2.3  (a.u.). 
Moreover, the broad resonance near E ~ 3.2 (a.u.) also becomes harder to resolve in the 
nonrelativistic limit. In fact, a more precise calculation of the resonance structure for this 
potential could be performed using, for example, the complex scaling method [18]. Such 
calculation  gives  the  relativistic  resonances:  E  =  2.2098  −i  0.0548  and  E  =  3.5786  −i 
0.9663 (a.u.). On the other hand, the nonrelativistic resonance energies are E = 2.3272 −i 
0.10486 and E = 3.5482 −i 1.2210 (a.u.). Figure 3 gives the integrated phase shift δ (E) as 
a  function  of  the  energy  for  the  relativistic  (solid  curve)  and  nonrelativistic  (dashed 
curve)  case.  Now,  we  turn  to  the  most  relevant  contribution  of  our  work:  the  effect  of 
spatial variation of the mass on the relativistic scattering matrix. Figure 4 and Fig. 5 are 
reproductions of Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 for the same system but for non-vanishing 
0S . We took 
2
.  One  of  the  obvious  effects  is  the  extreme 
0S =  1.0  (a.u.)  making 
sharpening and downshift of the resonance at E = 2.1 a.u. (relativistic) and E = 2.3 a.u. 
(nonrelativistic).  In  fact,  the  relativistic  resonance  structure  of  the  system  with  this 
position-dependent  mass  becomes  E  =  2.1211  −i  0.003185  and  E  =  3.9429  −i  0.4512 
(a.u.).  The  nonrelativistic  limit  of  this  structure  is  E  =  2.30333  −i  0.009111  and  E  = 
3.9270 −i 0.6693 (a.u.). Nonetheless, the full effect on the S-matrix for all energies (in 
the range of interest) is shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. 
 
 
Finally,  we  like  to  remark  that  the  extension  of  the  above  development  to  multi-
channel  scattering  is  straightforward,  which  could  be  carried  out  following  the  same 
scheme as in the classic J-matrix method [19].

Taking  the  nonrelativistic  limit  (

)  [7]  gives  A(cid:65)   = 

.  The  confluent 

hyper-geometric  series  in  (A10)  is  non-terminating  since  the  negative  of  the  first 
argument is half of odd integer. Therefore, for large values of N and higher energies, ε, 
numerical instability could, in principle, occur when trying to evaluate 
Nc ε  needed for 
the calculation of the scattering matrix. This is due to the fact that in such circumstances 
[as shown in Eq. (A10)] we would be multiplying a very small number coming from the

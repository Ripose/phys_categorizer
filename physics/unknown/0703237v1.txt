Abstract

In computer simulations we find that particles can scatter in bent crystal lattices with

effective  radiation  length  down  to  a  few  micron  or  300-700  times  shorter  than  in  the

corresponding  amorphous  materials.  We  derive  a  theoretical  estimate  independent  of

energy for the effective radiation length that is in agreement with our simulations for C,

Si, Ge, and W crystal lattices. We show that in the ongoing collimation experiment at the

Tevatron  a  crystal-based  “smart  scattering  material”  could  outperform  a  channeling

crystal in efficiency of collimation reducing the local background rate by a factor of 40.

1. Introduction

Crystal lattice can trap and channel particle beam along a major crystallographic direction [1].

In a bent crystal, the channeled particles follow the bend [2]. This made a basis for an elegant

technique  of  beam  steering  by  bent  channeling  crystals  experimentally  demonstrated  from  3

MeV [3] to 1 TeV [4]. In IHEP, crystal systems extract protons on permanent basis from 70 GeV

ring with 85% efficiency [5]. Bent crystals channel in good agreement with predictions up to the

highest energies [6-8]. The nonchanneled particles in a bent crystal are often treated as “random”

particles in a misaligned lattice, i.e. they scatter on individual atoms like in amorphous body.

Recent experiments on beam collimation using bent crystals in the rings of Relativistic Heavy

Ion Collider [7] and Tevatron [8]  revealed strong coherent effects observed in a broad angular

range.  The  scattering  of  nonchanneled  particles  in  a  bent  crystal  differed  strongly  from  the

scattering  in  amorphous  body  over  the  whole  arc  of  the  crystal  bend.  The  same  effect  was

observed  in  simulations  in  quantitative  agreement  [7,8]  with  RHIC  and  Tevatron  data.

Simulations found two factors responsible for the effect [7,9]. Within the arc of the crystal bend,

a particle can become tangential to atomic planes somewhere in the crystal bulk. Two effects in

these  conditions  are  known  from  the  physics  of  channeling  and  quasi-channeling:  “volume

capture”  (scattering-induced  transfers  of  random  particles  to  channeled  states  leading  to

deflection towards the atomic plane bending) [10] and “volume reflection” (scattering of random

particles off the potential of bent atomic planes leading to deflection opposite the atomic plane

bending)  [11,12].  Volume  capture  happens  with  a  low  probability  (≤  1%  at  high-GeV  energy)

but may cause a big deflection, tens of µrad and much more. Volume reflection takes place with

probability of ~100% but causes a deflection on the order of 1-2 critical angle (6.8 µrad at 1 TeV

for  Si(110)  potential  well  of  22.8  eV).  Both  effects  were  studied  experimentally  on  external

beams from 3 MeV to high-GeV range [12].

Figure 1 The 980-GeV proton angular distribution downstream of a 3-mm Si(110) crystal: reflected

from the “strip” crystal, scattered in a “smart” crystal, and at random alignment.

On  a  circulating  beam  in  accelerator  ring,  the  importance  of  both  volume  capture  and

reflection  amplifies  strongly.  As  requested  by  theory  [13],  the  typical  size  of  a  Si  crystal  in

modern experiments on crystal-based collimation and extraction is just 1-5 mm, or ~0.2-1% of

proton nuclear interaction length [5,7]. Similar crystal size is proposed for the LHC collimation

[14].  Therefore,  each  circulating  particle  may  encounter  a  crystal  up  to  ~100-500  times.  This

greatly  increases  the  overall  probability  of  volume  capture  and  the  overall  effect  of  multiple

volume reflections. There is another essential consideration. In external beams, bent crystals deal

with deflections on the order ~30 mrad, while crystal collimation in a TeV-range ring involves a

deflection  of  mere  ~30  µrad.  Such  a  tiny  deflection  requires  a  channelling  in  crystal  over  a

distance  of  just  ~1/1000  of  the  usual.  This  makes  the  probability  of  such  an  event  (caused  by

volume  capture)  stronger  by  a  huge  factor.  Both  volume  capture  and  reflection  were  found

important for explanation of RHIC and Tevatron observations [7,9].

2. Simulations and analytical theory

Fig.  1  shows  a  reflection  effect  predicted  for  980-GeV  proton  in  a  “strip”  crystal  (3-mm

Si(110)  bent  0.15  mrad)  now  installed  into  vacuum  chamber  of  the  Tevatron  ring  [8].  The

reflected  beam  is  shifted  in  angle  by  –8.5  µrad  compared  to  the  beam  scattered  in  the  same

crystal at random alignment (shown). A barely seen tail of volume-captured protons on the right

of the reflected peak amounts to ~1% protons for deflections greater than 30 µrad. Such a nice

reflection happens only for crystal curvature 1/R much less than a critical one [11], which is pv/R

≈6 GeV/cm in Si for beam of momentum p and velocity v. In general, particle distribution shows

both a shift in the mean angle and an increase in rms angle because of coherent scattering in the

field  of  bent  atomic  planes.  Fig.  1  shows  another  example  with  the  same  crystal  bent  to  the

curvature  of  4  GeV/cm:  the  mean  angle  is  0  but  the  rms  angle  is  greater  than  one  at  random

alignment. We marked it a “smart” crystal because in the following we explore bent crystals as a

smart material, which exhibits unique scattering properties within a given angular range (the arc

of  the  crystal  bend)  but  shows  the  usual,  amorphous-like  scattering  behavior  outside  of  this

angular range.

Fig.  2  shows  the  rms  and  mean  exit  angles  (in  terms  of  the  critical  angle)  of  1-TeV  proton

downstream of a 1-mm bent Si(110) crystal obtained in simulations as a function of the crystal

curvature  (in  terms  of  the  critical  curvature).  For  a  strong  curvature,  the  mean  angle  becomes

zero while the rms angle is still increased compared to the rms scattering angle in a misaligned

crystal (1.45 µrad or 0.2 critical angle).

A particle  circulating in  accelerator ring  may  scatter  in  a  bent  crystal  many  times.  Between

the scatterings, particle makes a number of turns (and many betatron oscillations) in the ring and

comes to the crystal with some new incidence angle. If the new angle is still within the arc of the

crystal bend, the particle will experience another coherent scattering, and so on. The rms angle

θrms in individual scatterings is independent of the incidence angle if it is within the arc of the

crystal bend. Particle scattering with rms angle θrms over a crystal length L can be characterized

by effective radiation length Leff defined by analogy to radiation length LR of multiple Coulomb

scattering:

(1)

with ES ≈14 MeV. Simulations showed that in crystal collimation experiments [7,8] with a 5-mm

Si(110)  crystal  the  effective  radiation  length  Leff  was  shorter  than  the  usual  LR  =9.38  cm  in

amorphous  Si  by  a  factor  of  3  in  RHIC  case  and  factor  of  5  in  Tevatron  case,  which  led  to

significant and even dramatic changes measured in particle loss rate when the crystal alignment

was within the angular range corresponding to its arc bend ≈0.44 mrad. The increase in crystal

scattering angle from coherent effects made a beam diffusion to increase several-fold.

Figure 2 The rms and mean exit angles (in terms of the critical angle) of proton downstream of a bent

Si(110) crystal as a function of the crystal curvature (in terms of the critical curvature).

We  studied  in  computer  simulations  a  7-TeV  proton  scattering  in  several  crystal  lattices  of

different atomic number Z: C(110), Si(110), Ge(110), and W(110), trying to find in every case

the  limits  of  the  effective  radiation  length  Leff  .  The  results  can  be  better  understood  after  a

simple analytical consideration.

We  can  show  that  for  a  particle  scattering  in  crystal  lattice  bent  with  a  given  angle  θ  the

minimal effective radiation length Leff is independent of energy. On this  way, we  also derive a

simple analytical estimate for a minimal possible Leff in a crystal lattice. The minimal curvature

radius when the scattering is strong is on the order of the critical radius RC. With the crystal bend

angle of θ, the crystal length is L≈ RCθ. The angle of coherent scattering over this distance is on

the order of θC. We start with equation

and estimate the effective radiation length Leff as

from which one can already see that it is independent of energy because RC ~ pv and θC ~ (pv)-1/2.

several crystal lattices: C(110), Si(110), Ge(110), and W(110) shown as a function of a crystal

atomic number Z.

We take the constant ES

2 ≈ 4π(mec2)2/α in definition Rossi-Greisen [15], approximate RC and

θC with Lindhard potential as in ref. [16] and obtain a very simple estimate:

Here 137 is inversed α ≈1/137, aB Bohr radius, re classical electron radius, N volume density

of atoms, dp interplanar distance, Z atomic number of crystal. The angle θ, which sets the angular

range where Leff is effective, becomes a control parameter that can be used to set Leff as required

in application. The smaller is the angular range of the effect, the shorter Leff can be achieved.

Figure 3 shows Leff (for θ=25 µrad) as computed by Eq. (4) and actual values as obtained in

Monte Carlo simulations for crystal lattices from C(110) to W(110); eq (4) describes data rather

well.  These  examples  show  Leff  reduced  by  a  factor  of  300-700  compared  to  a  corresponding

amorphous  material  (or  randomly  aligned  crystal),  bringing  Leff  value  below  10  µm  in  case  of

W(110).  The  highest  reduction  factor,  700,  is  achieved  for  diamond.  The  value  of  θ=25  µrad

chosen in the examples is practical in applications like beam collimation in the LHC ring.

Fig. 4 shows an example of 7 TeV proton scattering in a Si(110) crystal bent 30 µrad in two

cases:  under  coherent  scattering  conditions  (smart  properties  switched  on,  effective  within  the

range  30  µrad  wide)  and  at  random  alignment  (i.e.  smart  properties  switched  off).  Notice  that

with planar orientation of crystal lattice the effect of strong coherent scattering takes place in just

one  plane  (the  plane  of  bending)  while  in  the  normal  plane  the  scattering  remains  the  usual

amorphous-like.

conditions and at random alignment.

The simulations have also shown that the nuclear interaction length LN in a bent crystal lattice

is almost the same as one in amorphous material. According to simulations, the LN /Leff ratio can

run up to 12000 while in amorphous materials LN /LR is order of 5 to 30. The value of LN scales
with atomic weight A roughly as A-2/3, so we expect the LN /Leff ratio to be scaled with Z as

(5)

(6)

 Recalling  a  formula  for  radiation  length  LR  in  amorphous  material,  we  expect  the  rough

scaling of the LR /Leff ratio with Z as

 

In  all  formulae  (3)-(6)  we  have  θ  as  control  parameter  that  can  be  used  for  tuning  of  the

“smart  material”  properties.  Notice  also  that  the  unique  properties  are  effective  within  the

angular  range  θ  only.  By  tilting  the  sample  outside  this  angular  range,  one  switches  the  smart

material properties back to normal amorphous values.

The above consideration doesn’t mean that a bending angle θ can be realized as small as one

wants  in  any  energy  range.  Actually,  the  minimal  crystal  size  should  be  on  the  order  of  one

oscillation length λ in a planar channel and the bending radius cannot be much smaller than RC.

Therefore, the angular range θ where a smart material is effective should be greater than ~λ/RC,

with respective restriction on the achievable (3)-(6) values. The λ/RC value is about 20 µrad at 7

TeV in silicon, which is quite practical figure for applications in LHC collimation. With energy
E the λ/RC value is scaled as E-1/2 and becomes ~20 mrad in low MeV range.

3. Tevatron test of “smart scattering material”

The unique scattering properties can be observed in just a single interaction of particle with a

bent crystal lattice, as shown in Figs. 1 and 4. However, the accelerator ring with a circulating

beam offers spectacular opportunities for the studies of crystal-based smart materials, as already

demonstrated  at  RHIC  [7]  and  Tevatron  [8].  The  ongoing  Tevatron  experiment  on  crystal

collimation is an excellent test bed for new crystal smart materials.

It  can  measure  nuclear  interaction  rate  in  a  crystal  irradiated  by  a  circulating  beam  of  980

GeV protons over a broad range of crystal alignment. Fig. 5 shows the predicted dependence of

the  rate  on  alignment  for  the  new,  “strip-type”  crystal  (3-mm  Si(110)  bent  0.15  mrad)  now

installed into vacuum chamber of the Tevatron ring [8].

For simulations we used Monte Carlo code CATCH [17] with the recent edition of Tevatron

accelerator lattice [18]. More details of the used settings are in ref. [19]. The crystal was placed

at  5σ  and  served  as  a  primary  element  in  collimation  scheme.  The  secondary  collimator  was

placed 31.5 m downstream, at 5.5σ. Particle tracking in the Tevatron lattice was done with linear

transfer  matrices.  Each  particle  was  allowed  to  make  an  unlimited  number  of  turns  in  the  ring

and  of  encounters  with  the  crystal  until  a  particle  either  undergoes  a  nuclear  interaction  in  the

crystal or hits the secondary collimator (because of a bending effect in the channeling crystal or

of the scattering events).

For best alignment of the strip crystal, one has a remarkable dip in the rate, 96% down from

the rate observed at random orientation, due to channeling of protons with high efficiency onto

the secondary collimator. The plateau 0.15 mrad wide (the arc of the strip crystal) is the effect of

coherent  scattering  where  the  effective  radiation  length  is  7  mm,  factor  of  13  shorter  than  in

amorphous  Si,  and  the  rate  is  suppressed  by  65%.  The  particle  amplitude  in  accelerator  grows

faster if coherent processes contribute strongly to the overall scattering. The difference in beam

dynamics  on  the  phase  space  with  a  crystal  under  conditions  of  coherent  scattering  leads  to  a

faster particle loss on the secondary elements of accelerator. As a result, the particle loss (nuclear

interactions) in crystal is reduced, as part of the loss now goes to different elements in the ring.

Figure  5  The  predicted  crystal  nuclear  interaction  rate  for  protons  in  the  Tevatron  with  the  “strip”

crystal and with a “smart” crystal.

In order to check our understanding of crystal-based smart scattering materials and show their

capability, we make a further prediction. In the same collimation setup we simulated a Si(110)

crystal  0.1  mm  along  the  beam  with  bending  of  60  µrad.  Notice  that  there  are  techniques

producing Si crystals as short as 1 µm -1 mm along the beam, with cross size in centimeter range

and  bending  up  to  mrad  range,  which  can  be  very  useful  for  considered  test  and  applications

[12].  Our  choice  for  a  smart  crystal  was  the  curvature  of  6  GeV/cm,  which  excludes  any

possibility  of  channeling.  Fig.  5  shows  the  prediction  for  the  simulated  smart  crystal  in

comparison with a channeling strip crystal.

The expected effective radiation length within the arc of 60 µrad is only 0.5 mm or factor of

180 (!) shorter than its value outside of the arc (or in amorphous Si). It produces a tremendous

effect bringing the rate down by 97.5% or factor of 40 from the random rate. What is particularly

striking is that the effect is stronger than even channeling (which itself shows a record efficiency

here).  In  the  channeling  crystal,  the  rate  within  5  µrad  of  the  tip  is  0.075  of  the  random  rate

whereas  in  the  “smart”  crystal  the  rate  is  0.025,  i.e.  three  times  lower  than  in  the  channeling

crystal.  Moreover,  smart  crystal  shows  the  low  rate  over  a  broad  angular  range.  In  accelerator

ring, such a smart target would be an extremely efficient scatterer.

4. Conclusion

We conclude that coherent effects in particle scattering in bent crystal lattices can reduce the

effective  scattering  length  by  2-3  orders  of  magnitude  compared  to  radiation  length  in

amorphous materials. This phenomenon was behind the effects observed in crystal collimation at

RHIC and Tevatron where the effective radiation length was shorter by a factor of 3 to 5 than in

amorphous  silicon,  according  to  simulations.  Bent  crystals  can  be  realized  as  smart  materials

showing the effective radiation length in a single plane 300-700 times shorter within a defined

angular range, with normal radiation length of amorphous material outside of that angular range.

A simple theoretical estimate is found for the effective radiation length that is in agreement with

our simulations for C, Si, Ge, and W crystal lattices.  In crystal collimation experiment, the new

smart  material  can  outperform  the  channeling  crystal  by  a  big  factor,  as  predictions  for  the

ongoing  Tevatron  experiment  show.  More  possibilities  may  come  from  nanostructures  where

beam reflection is also observed in simulations [20]. This could make a basis for a new principle

of  beam  instrumentation  in  accelerators  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  radiation  protection  by

orders of magnitude, e.g. in collimation systems of LHC and ILC.

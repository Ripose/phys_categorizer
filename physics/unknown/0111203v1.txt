We analyze the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated from transfer matrix simulations 
on  finite  lengths  of  electromagnetic  metamaterials,  to  determine  the  effective  permittivity  (ε)  and 
permeability  (µ).    We  perform  this  analysis  on  structures  composed  of  periodic  arrangements  of 
wires,  split  ring  resonators  (SRRs)  and  both  wires  and  SRRs.    We  find  the  recovered  frequency-
dependent ε and µ are entirely consistent with analytic expressions predicted by effective medium 
arguments.  Of particular relevance are that a wire medium exhibits a frequency region in which the 
real  part  of  ε  is  negative,  and  SRRs  produce  a  frequency  region  in  which  the  real  part  of  µ  is 
negative.  In the combination structure, at frequencies where both the recovered real parts of ε and 
µ  are  simultaneously  negative,  the  real  part  of  the  index-of-refraction  is  found  also  to  be 
unambiguously negative.

Abstract 
 
We  study  the  performance  of  two-phase  avalanche  detectors  based  on  Gas  Electron  Multipliers  (GEMs)  and 
operated  in  an  electron-avalanching  mode  in  Ar  and  Xe.  Emission,  gain,  energy  resolution  and  stability 
characteristics  of  the  detectors  were  studied.  Rather  high  gains,  reaching  5000,  and  stable  operation  for  several 
hours were observed in the two-phase Ar avalanche detector using a triple-GEM multiplier. The signals induced 
by X-rays, b -particles and g -rays were successfully recorded. Preliminary results were obtained in the two-phase 
Xe avalanche detector: the maximum gain of the triple-GEM in two-phase Xe and Xe+2%CH4 was about 200. The 
results  obtained  are  relevant  in  the  field  of  two-phase  detectors  for  dark  matter  searches,  coherent  neutrino 
scattering, PET and digital radiography.

1.  Introduction 

The 

two-phase 

studies  of 

(liquid-gas) 
detectors  operated  in  an  electron-avalanching 
mode  (Two-Phase  Avalanche  Detectors)  have 
been  motivated  by  a  growing  interest  in  their 
applications  in  cryogenic  experiments  where 
the  primary  ionization  signal  is  weak:  in 
coherent  neutrino  scattering  [1],  dark  matter 
searches  [2],  solar  neutrino  detection  [3]  and 
Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  [4].  A 
typical deposited energy in such experiments is 
in  the range of  1-500 keV, i.e.  might be rather

In two-phase avalanche detectors [5] (see Fig. 
1)  the primary electrons produced in the noble 
liquid  are  emitted  into  the  gas  phase  by  an 
electric  field  where  they  are  multiplied  in 
saturated  vapor  above  the  liquid  using  a  gas 
multiplier, 
the  Gas  Electron 
Multiplier  (GEM)  [6].    In  some  cases,  the

[5,7]  that  the  multi-GEM  multiplier  would 
provide the detection of both the ionization and 
scintillation  signals  in  two-phase  avalanche 
detectors (Fig. 1). The latter would be achieved 
by  depositing  an  UV-sensitive  photocathode, 
namely  CsI,  on  top  of  the  first  GEM.    This

The  remarkable  property  of  GEM  structures 
is  that  they  can  operate  in  all  noble  gases  at 
reasonable gains [9,10],  including at cryogenic 
temperatures  [5,11-13]  and  even  down  to  2  K 
[13].  Later  it  was  shown  that  other  hole-type 
structures, such as Micro-Hole and Strip Plates 
[14] and Capillary Plates [15], can also operate 
in noble gases.  

It might be desirable to use all noble gases for 
two-phase  detectors.

searches,  He  and  Ne  for  solar  neutrino 
detection  [3],  Xe  for  PET  [17],  Ar  and  Kr  for 
digital radiography [18].  

On  the  other  hand,  the  operation  of  GEM 
structures in a two-phase mode was studied for 
Kr-based  detectors  only  [11,12]:  the  stable 
operation of a two-phase Kr avalanche detector, 
at  gains 
reaching  several  hundreds,  was 
demonstrated  for  at  least  3  hours.  Recently,  it 
has  also  been  reported  on  the  Micromegas 
operation in two-phase Xe [19], but for a short 
period:  in  half  an  hour  the  signal  disappeared. 
Furthermore,  unlike  GEM,  the  Micromegas 
cannot operate in pure noble gases: therefore a 
CH4  additive  was  used  there.  Since  methane 
dissolves  in  liquid  Xe,  this  may  in  principle 
result  in  quenching  the  scintillations  and  an 
increase  of 
the  electric  field  needed  for 
efficient electron emission. 

Consequently, 

the  studies  of 

the  GEM 
performance in noble gases other than Kr, in a 
two-phase mode, are of primary importance. In 
this paper, the performance of GEM structures 
in  two-phase  Ar,  Xe  and  Xe+CH4  was  studied 
for the first time.  Emission, gain, energy, pulse 
shape and stability characteristics of two-phase 
avalanche  detectors  are  presented  under 
irradiation with X-rays, g -rays and b -particles.  

 
2. Experimental setup 

in 

The  results  presented 

the  following 
sections are obtained in the experimental setup 
similar  to  that  used  for  the  two-phase  Kr 
detector [11,12]. Three GEM foils, of an active 
area  of  28×28  mm2  each,  and  a  cathode  mesh 
were mounted in a cryogenic vacuum-insulated 
chamber  of  a  volume  of  2.5  l  (Fig.1).  The 
distances  between  the  first  GEM  and  the 
cathode, and between the GEMs, were 6 and 2 
mm,  respectively.  The  chamber  was  cooled  by 
liquid nitrogen using a heat exchanger mounted 
on  the  top  flange.  In  the  two-phase  mode  the 
thickness  of  the  liquid  condensate  at  the 

2 

 

chamber bottom was approximately 3 mm, at a 
vapor  pressure  of  1  atm.  The  condensate 
characteristics,  namely  its  thickness  and  state 
(liquid or solid), were monitored by measuring 
a  capacitance  of  the  cathode  gap,  between  the 
cathode and the first GEM.  

The  chamber  was  filled  with  appropriate 
gases, Ar or Xe, or gas mixture, Xe+CH4, taken 
directly  from  a  40  l  bottle  connected  to  the 
chamber at all times. The electron drift path in 
liquid  Ar  before  attachment  was  larger  than  3 
mm, which is equivalent to an oxygen impurity 
level  of  below  10-6.  The  electron  drift  path  in 
liquid  Xe  was  only  0.6  mm  (due  to  impurities 
released by outgassing and their high solubility 
in liquid Xe), which is equivalent to an oxygen 
impurity level of approximately 3×10-6. 

The detector was operated in either a current 
or  pulse-counting  mode.  It  was  irradiated  with 
either  continuous  or  pulsed  X-rays  from  two 
different X-ray tubes (operated in the current or 
pulsed  mode 
through  X-ray 
respectively) 
windows  at  the  chamber  bottom  having  a 
diameter  of  1  cm.  The  anode  voltages  of  the 
tubes  were  typically  30-50  kV.  The  width  and 
frequency  of  X-ray  pulses  were  400  ns 
respectively.  The 
(FWHM)  and  250  Hz 
detector  could also operate in a pulse-counting 
mode  using  b -particles  from  a  90Sr  source  and 
60 keV g -rays from a 241Am source.  

The  GEM  electrodes  were  biased  through  a 
resistive high-voltage divider placed outside the 
cryostat  and  similar  to  that  used  in  Ref.  [13]. 
The GEM multiplier could operate in a single-, 
double-  or  triple-GEM  configuration,  denoted 
as  1GEM,  2GEM  or  3GEM  respectively.  The 
avalanche (anode) signal was recorded from the 
last electrode of the last active GEM element. 

The  gain  value  was  measured  in  a  pulse-
counting  mode  using  pulsed  X-rays  and  a 
technique  described  in  Ref.  [13]:  it  is  defined 
as  the  pulse  height  of  the  avalanche  signal 
divided  by  that  of  the  calibration  signal.  The 
calibration  signal  was  recorded  at  the  first 
electrode  of  the  first  GEM.  Both  signals  were 
read out using a charge-sensitive amplifier with 

a 10 ns rise time and sensitivity of 0.5 V/pC. In 
addition,  in  some  cases  the  gain  value  was 
measured  in  a  current  mode  using  a  technique 
described in Ref. [11].  

Other  details  of  the  experimental  setup  and 

procedures are described elsewhere [11,12].

pressure  range  of  1.3-1.8  atm,  the  detector 
operates  in  a  gaseous  mode:  the  capacitance 
almost does not change and its fluctuations are 
negligible. Below 1.3 atm the detector operates 
in a two-phase mode: a liquid Ar condensate is 
formed at the chamber bottom and both the gap 
are

capacitance 
substantially  increased.  During  the  heating 
procedure the liquid condensate at the bottom is 
preserved up to a vapor pressure of 1.7 atm.

the  bottom could not be transformed to a solid 
state, apparently due to the fact that the boiling 
point of liquid nitrogen is close to that of liquid 
argon.  Moreover,  the  last  point  in  the  cooling 
cycle,  at  85  K  and  0.76  atm,  turned  out  to  be 
the  best  in  terms  of  the  temperature  and 
pressure stabilization: the pressure stability was 
within  1%.  Most  of  the  data  presented  below

lower than that of liquid Kr and Xe [20], which 
is  a  good  advantage.  The  large  value  of  the 
anode current reached in a current mode should 
be emphasized: it is 200 nA (right scale in Fig. 
3)  corresponding  to  a  current  density  of  2.5 
nA/mm2.

One  can  see  that  practically  for  all  GEM 
configurations  the  gain  grows  exponentially 
with  voltage.  Only  at  1.0  atm,  there  is  an 
indication  that  the  gain  starts  to  grow  slightly 
faster  than  exponentially,  at  higher  gains.  In  a

Fig.6  Pulse-height  spectra  from  the  triple-GEM  induced 
by 60 keV g -rays from a 241Am source, at a gain of 2500 at 
two different electric fields in the liquid, in two-phase Ar 
at 85 K and 0.76 atm. 
 

The  anode  signals  from  the  triple-GEM 
induced by 60 keV g -rays, in two-phase Ar, are 
shown  in  Fig.  7.    At  moderate  gain  (700)  the 
pulse shape is almost triangular, while at higher 
gain  (2500)  the  primary  signal  is  accompanied 
by a secondary signal. The secondary signals at 
comparable  gains  and 
time  scales  were 
observed  earlier  in  gaseous Ar  [11]: they were 
explained by photon feedback between the last 
GEM  and  the  copper  cathode,  enhanced  at 
cryogenic  temperatures.  In  the  present  version 
of  the  setup,  the  cathode  could  hardly  provide 
the feedback since it had a small effective area. 
Most  probably,  the  secondary  signals  were 
caused  by  photon  feedback  between  the  GEM 
elements themselves.  

A  detector  response  to  pulsed  X-rays  is 
illustrated in Fig. 8: anode signals and a pulse-
height  spectrum  from  the  triple-GEM  are 
shown.  The  amplitude  resolution  is  14.0% 
(FWHM).  Here  the  measurement  time  was 
short,  of  a  few  seconds,  resulting  in  that  the 
contribution  of  pressure  variations 
the 
resolution  was  negligible.  In  that  case  the

spectra from the double-GEM at  a gain of 700 
are  shown.  The  counting  rate  was  of  the order 
of  10  kHz.  The  range  of  a  1  MeV  electron  in 
liquid Ar is 3 mm. That means that half of the 
b -particles  would  not  stop 
the  liquid, 
resulting in that the b -spectrum measured in the 
detector  would  be  distorted.  Nevertheless,  one 
can  see  that  the  shape  of  the  b -spectrum  is 
reflected  in  the  pulse-height  spectra  in  general 
and that the dependence on the extraction field 
is  well  pronounced,  similarly  to  that  observed 
in Fig. 6.

Indeed, accounting for the pulse height of the 
calibration  signal,  amplifier  sensitivity  and 
fraction 
escaping 
recombination (which is taken to be 50% for 40 
keV photons [21]), the energy deposited in the 
liquid  by  an  X-ray  pulse  is  estimated  to  be  16 
MeV, which roughly corresponds to 400 X-ray 
photons  absorbed.  Thus,  the  contribution  of 
photon 
is 
to 
2.35/√400=12% which is close to that observed 
in  experiment.  This  fact  indicates  that  the  Ar 
purity  was  high  enough  to  collect  the  charge 
from the whole of the liquid layer, i.e. that the 
liquid  Ar  before 
in

trigger  signal  from  an  X-ray  tube,  on  the  top,  are  also

pulse  is  estimated  to  be  about 16 MeV,  corresponding  to 
about 400 X-ray photons absorbed. 
 

In  addition,  Fig.  9  gives  an  idea  of  the 
response  of  two-phase  Ar  avalanche  detectors 
to  minimum  ionizing particles. For example, it 
follows from Fig. 9  that the average amplitude 
of  the  signals  induced  by  b -particles,  reduced 
to  the  gain  value  of  Fig.  6,  would  be  by  an 
order  of  magnitude  larger  than  for  those 
induced  by  60  keV  g -rays.  This  fact  indicates 
that the detector response to minimum ionizing 
particles  may  produce  a  serious  background 
problem in low-background experiments.

gradually returns to the initial value, indicating 
a  disappearance  of  the  condensate  at  the 
chamber  bottom,  similarly  to  that  observed  in 
the  two-phase  Kr  detector  [12].  This  takes 
place  due  to  a  sublimation  of  solid  Xe  at  the

there is no condensate at the chamber bottom at 
all.

The operation of the two-phase Ar avalanche 
detector,  using  the  triple-GEM  multiplier,  was 
rather  stable  and  reproducible,  in  particular  at 
the  point  of  the  best  pressure  stabilization.  No 
gain  instabilities  were  observed  for  at  least  6 
hours; during this period the detector was under 
voltage  and  the  height  of  the  pulse  from  the 
triple-GEM,  induced  by  pulsed  X-rays  or  b -
particles, was measured at regular intervals.

the  liquid  and  absorbed  in  the  vapor  phase.  In 
contrast  to  Ar,  this  component  is  observed  in 
two-phase Xe because the electron drift path in 
liquid  Xe  was  much  smaller  than  that  in  Ar, 
resulting in a reduction of the electron emission 
component. The electron drift path in liquid Xe 
is  estimated  to  be  0.6  mm, taking into account 
the relative contributions of the components in 
Fig.  11  and  X-ray  absorption  coefficients  in 
liquid and gaseous Xe.  

Fig.12  shows  gain-voltage  characteristics  of 
the  triple-GEM  in  two-phase  Xe  at  a  vapor 
pressure of 0.88 and 0.99 atm, measured using 
pulsed  X-rays.  In  Fig.  4 the gain characteristic 
is  compared  to  those  in  two-phase  Ar  and  Kr. 
One  can  see  that  the  maximum  gain  in  two-
phase  Xe  is  about  200,  which  is  somewhat 
lower  than  that  in  Kr  and  substantially  lower 
than that in Ar.

A  detector  response  to  pulsed  X-rays  is

a factor of 30 if normalized to the gain) and the 
amplitude  resolution  is  worse  (65%,  FWHM)

obviously  due 
the  effect  of  electron 
attachment  in  liquid  Xe.  The  “detectable” 
energy  which  might  be  attributed  to  this 
resolution, i.e. the energy corresponding to the 
amount  of  ionization  reached  the  triple-GEM 
per X-ray pulse, is estimated to be 200 keV.  

The  operation  stability  of  gas  multipliers  in 
two-phase  Xe  is  of  particular  importance. 
Indeed, it was observed that the period of stable 
operation  of  the  Micromegas  and  proportional 
chamber  in  saturated  Xe  vapor  did  not  exceed 
half  an  hour  [19,22].  This  instability  was 
believed  to  be  due  to  Xe  vapor  condensation 
within  the  gas  multiplier.  In  the  present  work, 
the  operation  stability  of  the  triple-GEM  in 
two-phase Xe was measured for a period of half 
an hour at a gain of 80 under irradiation with b -
particles.  During  this  period  the  triple-GEM 
operation  was  relatively  stable  and  the  gain 
variations  observed  (of  a  factor  of  2)  were 
correlated  to  the  vapor  pressure  variations  (of 
about  5%).  It  should  be  remarked  that  this 
result  is  rather  preliminary,  due  to  the  large 
pressure  variations  induced  by  insufficient 
temperature stabilization.  

We  studied  the  possibility  to  increase  the 
maximum gain in the two-phase Xe detector by 
adding  a  quenching  gas,  namely  methane.  In 
the  mixture  Xe+2.1%CH4  was 
that  case 
prepared  in  the  bottle  at  room  temperature. 
Since the maximum dissolution level of CH4 in 
liquid  Xe  was  found  to  be 1.9% [23], the CH4 
concentration  in  Xe  vapor  in  the  two-phase 
mode might be taken as approximately 2%. Fig. 
12  shows  gain-voltage  characteristics  of  the 
triple-GEM  in  Xe+CH4  mixture  in  the  two-
phase mode, when there is  a liquid condensate 
at  the  chamber  bottom,  and  in  the  gaseous 
mode,  when  there  is  no  condensate  at  the 
bottom.  At  cryogenic  temperatures,  in  the 
gaseous  mode  the  gain  can  easily  exceed  104, 
while in the two-phase mode the maximum gain 
does not exceed 200, i.e. is practically the same 
as  in  two-phase  Xe.    This  result  indicates  that 
just  the  operation  in  the  two-phase  mode 
imposes a principal limit on the maximum gain.  

  5. Conclusions 

The  performance  of  two-phase  (liquid-gas) 
Ar and Xe avalanche detectors, based on GEM 
structures  and  operated 
in  an  electron-
avalanching  mode,  have  been  studied  for  the 
first time. Emission, gain, energy resolution and 
stability  characteristics  of  the  detectors  were 
studied.

emission 
reaches  a  plateau  at  a  relatively  low  electric 
field  in  the  liquid,  as  compared  to  Kr  and  Xe, 
namely  at  2.5  kV/cm.  The  signals  induced  by 
X-rays,  b -particles  and  60  keV  g -rays  were 
successfully  recorded.  In  the  latter  case,  the 
energy resolution obtained was 37% (FWHM); 
it  is  defined  by  pressure  variations  during  the 
measurements  and  should  be  improved  in  the 
detector with better temperature stabilization. A 
stable operation of the triple-GEM multiplier in 
saturated  vapor  above  the  liquid  was  observed 
for at least 6 hours. There were no charging-up 
effects  observed,  even  at  anode  current 
densities as large as 2.5 nA/mm2. 

The  GEM-based  two-phase  Xe  avalanche 
detector was successfully operated at moderate 
gains.  The  electric  fields  needed  for  efficient 
electron emission from liquid Xe are by a factor 
of 2-3 higher, compared to Ar.  The maximum 
gain  of  the  triple-GEM  in  saturated  Xe  vapor 
above  the  liquid  is  about  200.  Adding  a  few 
percents  of  methane  to  saturated  Xe  vapor  did 
not  increase  the  maximum  gain.  A  relatively 
stable  operation  of  the  detector  was  observed 
for  half  an  hour  when  irradiated  with  b -
particles.  However,  further  measurements  are 
needed  in  order  to  understand  the  instability 
mechanism 
  in  two-phase  Xe  avalanche 
detectors  observed  by  other  authors.  Low  gain

Abstract 

The shape of an RF pulse is distorted upon propagating through an X-band accelerator structure due to dispersive effects. This 
distortion together with beam loading introduce energy spread between 192 bunches. In order to minimize this energy spread we 
modify the input RF pulse shape.  The pulse propagation, energy gain, and beam loading are modelled with a mode-matching 
computer code and a circuit model.  A 2D model and a circuit model of a complete 60 cm structure, consisting of 55 cells and 
input  and  output  couplers  is  analyzed.    This  structure  operates  with  a  5π/6  phase  advance  per cell. Dispersive effects for this 
structure are more significant than for previously studied 2π/3 phase advance accelerating structures.  Experimental results are 
compared  with  the  theoretical  model  and  excellent  agreement  is  obtained  for  the  propagation  of  an  RF  pulse  through  the 
structure.

Abstract

The shape of an RF pulse is distorted upon propagating
through an X-band accelerator structure due to dispersive 
effects.  This  distortion  together  with  beam  loading
introduce energy spread between 192 bunches. In order to
minimize  this  energy  spread  we  modify the input RF
pulse  shape.    The  pulse  propagation,  energy gain, and
beam  loading  are  modelled  with  a  mode-matching
computer code and  a  circuit  model.    A  2D  model  and  a 
circuit model of a complete 60 cm structure, consisting of 
55 cells and input and output couplers is analyzed. This
structure  operates  with  a  5π/6  phase  advance  per  cell.
Dispersive  effects  for  this  structure  are  more  significant 
for  previously studied 2π/3  phase  advance 
than 
accelerating  structures.
results  are 
compared  with  the  theoretical  model  and  excellent 
agreement is obtained for the propagation of an RF pulse
through the structure.

Experimental 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The  NLC/JLC  (Next  Linear  Collider/Japanese  Linear
Collider) baseline design  now  consists  of  eight  60cm
accelerating  structures  attached  to  a  girder  (of  which 
there are several thousand).  Each cell in the structure has
a phase advance of 5π/6.  Previously 2π/3 was the phase
advance of  choice,  but  a  higher  phase  advance  was 
chosen in order to reduce  the  group  velocity  of  the
fundamental  mode  wave,  which  was  thought  to  reduce 
any electrical breakdown  occurring  in  the  structures  [1].
A CAD view of several cells in H60VG3 is shown in fig.
1.  This accelerating structure consists of 55 cells and has
been  carefully  designed  to  reduce  the  electromagnetic
fields on the surface of the copper, to minimize the pulse
temperature  heating  effects  (by  shaping  the  cavity-
manifold slots into a “pie” shape).

55  cells  and  this  is  discussed  in  section  2.  Section 3
delineates the effect of beam loading on the overall pulse
shape and  means  to  overcome  the  energy  deviation  over 
the pulse train caused by this dispersive effect.

2. DISPERSION IN TW STUCTURES 
Shown in fig 2  is  the  result  of  an  experiment  to
measure the pulse  shape  after  transiting  through  all  55 
cells  of  the  TW  (Travelling  Wave) structure H60VG3.
Distortion is evident at both the trailing and leading edge 
of the pulse.

for  a  240ns  input  rectangular  pulse  with  a  10ns rise and
fall time injected into H60VG3

To simulate the propagation of the pulse we utilize the
0  and  π  frequencies  from  5  cells  in  a  3D simulation of
cells with  boundary  conditions  corresponding  to  an 
infinitely periodic structure.  From these points we obtain
the corresponding dispersion curves  for  these  cells  and 
additional cells are  obtained  by  interpolation.    We  use  a 
circuit model [2]  to  simulate  the  propagation  of  a  pulse
through this

impedance structures.

structure  and  also 

Prior to obtaining the pulse shape the accelerator must
matched to the attached couplers and this is simulated by
varying  the  end  cell  frequencies  and  Q  values.    Fig. 3
illustrates  the  frequency  behaviour  of  the reflection
coefficients  after  the  structure has been  matched.    In  all
cases  to  achieve  this  reflection  coefficient  we  utilize [3]
and  apply  it  to  the  circuit  model  to  obtain  minimize the
internal  reflection  coefficient  of  the  accelerator.
The
pulse  shape  after  propagating  through  all  55  cells  is
shown  in  fig  4  for three phase advances: 2π/3, 3π/4 and 
5π/6.    Before  electrical  breakdown  and  the consequent
damage  to  the  structures  was  discovered  [4],  all DDS
(Damped and Detuned Structures) were fabricated with a 
2π/3 phase advance per cell.  Little pulse distortion is

Figure  3:  Reflection  coefficient  of  the input to several
travelling  wave  accelerator  structures  each  of which
consists of 55 cells.  The uppermost consists of a constant
impedance structure with a phase advance per cell of 120 
degrees,  the  middle  to  a  constant impedance with 135
degrees phase advance and, the lowermost to H60VG3 in
which the phase advance  is  150  degrees  and  the  cell
parameters vary smoothly along the accelerator structure. 

Figure 4:  A rectangular pulse with a fall and rise time of
10ns  and  a  flat-top  of  240ns  and  50ns  is propagated
through  the  accelerating  structures  described  in  fig  3. 
The  final  output  pulse  for  each  structure  is  illustrated 
above (blue and dashed for the shorter input pulse).

seen for  this  case.  The  reduced  group  velocity  structure
that was measured experimentally (fig 2.) corresponds to
the simulation in fig 4 with a 5π/6 phase advance per cell.
The distortion recorded  in  the  experiment  is  well
represented by the simulation and it is clear that the pulse
distortion  occurs  due  to  dispersion  in  the  structure. The
intermediate  phase  advance  of  3π/4  gives  rise  to  very
little distortion in the pulse shape and it is shown because 
it corresponds to another potential structure that has been
under consideration for the  NLC.    In  all  cases  shown  in
figs. 3 and 4 a circuit model has been used.   However, a 
mode  matching  method  [5]  applied  to  the  5π/6  case 
shows very similar pulse distortion.  We utilize this mode
matching  method  to  calculate  energy  gained by 192
electron  bunches  traversing  the  structure  and  this  is
described in the following section

accelerating  structure  load  down the  accelerating  field 
and consequently the field is reduced.  In order to reduce 
this droop in the field the initial RF pulse is ramped up as
the structure is filled with electromagnetic field.  Here we 
calculate the effect of beam loading from the impedance

deviation along the bunch  train;  the  maximum  deviation
is  below  0.2%.        Application  of the same iterative
method  again  gives  the  set  of  points  “2”  (magenta)  and 
this reduces the energy deviation still further, to less than
0.1%.      Further  application  of  this technique allows the
energy deviation to be reduced to less than 0.05%. The
input pulse prescribed from this process is shown in fig 7.

of  the  beam  [5]  and  the  beam loading,  together  with  the
total  pulse  are  shown  in  fig  5.    Over  all  bunches  the
energy  deviation  from  bunch-to–bunch  is  quite small.
However, the energy  deviation  at  the  final  focus  of  the
collider is required to be very small, namely  0.25% RMS
[6].   For this reason we show the energy deviation along
the pulse train on an expanded scale in fig 6. The set of
points labelled 0 corresponds to this energy deviation and
the maximum deviation is approximately 0.75%.

To compensate for this deviation in the energy over the
bunch train we investigated reshaping the input RF pulse
to the structure.  A fraction of the derivative of the energy 
deviation  over  train  of  bunches  is added to the original
input pulse and this fraction is varied until the energy

Manipulating  the  phase  of  the  klystrons  that  feed  the
structure will allow this pulse shape to be obtained [7].

This  energy  compensation  method  results  in  a  small
loss  of  energy  as  the  pulse  is  compensated over the
course  of  the  bunch  train.    We are also investigating
applying  a  similar  compensation  scheme over the initial
ramp  of  the  pulse  and  this  will  minimize the loss in
overall efficiency.

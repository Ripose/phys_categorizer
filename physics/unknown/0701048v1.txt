Abstract 
Noise  measurement  on  a  population of a gearbox manufactured in large number reveals a high variability 
principally  due  to  tolerances  on  each  design  parameter  of  the  gear.  Gearbox  noise  results  mainly  from 
vibration of its housing excited by the transmission error. High dynamic mesh load, high vibratory response 
of housing and high acoustic level of the gearbox can be observed for some critical rotational speeds. These 
ones correspond to excitation in a resonant manner of some particular modes which store a high potential 
energy at the meshing stiffness. Variability of the associated critical modes depend on tolerances affected to 
gear  design  parameters.  It  also  depends  on  bearings  stiffnesses  dispersion.  The  physical  origins  of  the 
bearings stiffnesses  variability are preloads. Bearings stiffnesses and tolerances affect the characteristics of 
the  meshing  stiffness  and  the  dynamic  transfer  from  dynamic  meshing  force  to  the  housing  vibratory 
response. The purpose of this paper is to study effect of the bearings stiffnesses variability by estimating the 
first two moments of statistical distribution of critical modes.

Introduction

teeth  under 
(2) teeth 

The vibratory and acoustical behaviour of gearboxes 
results from numerous sources [1]. Among these, it 
is  generally  admitted  that  the  main  source  is  the 
static  transmission  error  under  load  (STE)  [1,2]. 
STE is mainly governed by periodic components at 
the meshing frequency due to (1) elastic deflections 
load 
of  gear 
(periodic  meshing 
geometry  modifications, 
stiffness), 
(4) shaft 
errors 
(3) manufacturing 
misalignments.  Under  operating  conditions,  STE 
generates  dynamic  mesh  forces  leading  to dynamic 
forces  and  moments  transmitted  through  bearings, 
housing vibration and noise.  
Further, critical rotation speeds associated with high 
dynamic  mesh  forces  and  high  noise 
levels, 
correspond to the excitation of some critical modes 
having  a  high  potential  energy  stored  by  the 
meshing  stiffness  [3].  These  critical  speeds  are 
mainly  controlled  by  the  time-average  meshing 
stiffness and bearings stiffnesses. 
At  last,  considering  gearbox  manufactured  in  large 
number,  we  observe  dispersion  of  critical  speeds 
and excitation levels mainly due to the variability of 
STE,  meshing  stiffness  and  bearings  stiffnesses. 
Sources  of  dispersion  result  mainly  from  geometry

In this context, the aim of this paper is to deal with 
some results about variabilities of peak to peak STE, 
time-average meshing stiffness, bearings stiffnesses 
and  critical  speeds.  Statistics  are  obtained  from  a 
modified  Taguchi's  method.  Introduced  sources  of 
shaft 
variability  are 
misalignments  and  the  bearing’s  preload  on  each 
shaft. One can remark that bearing’s preloads play a 
game  not  only  on  the  natural  modes  of  the  overall 
model  (effect  of  stiffness  matrix)  but  also  on 
excitation  source  (effect  of  misalignment  between

2.1  Modified Taguchi’s method 

A modified Taguchi's method allows to estimate in a 
very  simple  way  the  statistical  moments  of  a 
function  of  multiple  random  variables  whose 
probability  densities  are  known  [4].  Statistical 
moments  are  estimated  from  numerical  integration 
of  Gauss  quadrature  type.  Then,  the  response 
function  is  calculated  for  a  relatively  short number 

parameters. 

of  samples,  judiciously  chosen.  For  each  uncertain 
variable,  a  number  of  samples  up  to  three  is 
necessary  to  take  into  account  the  eventual  non-
linear behaviour of the response function. Precision 
increases rapidly with this number of samples. More 
precisely,  the  number  of  samples  is  equal  to  the 
product  of  the  number  of  levels  chosen  for  each 
factor. In this study, we used 3 levels per factor, so 
27  samples  are  needed  to  treat  the  three  retained 
random 
principal 
advantages  of  this  method  are  the  ease  of  its 
numerical  implementation  and  its  short  computing 
time.  Efficiency  of

2.2  Calculation of the STE  

requires  knowledge  of 

The  STE  is  obtained  by  solving  the  static 
equilibrium  of  the  gear  pair  for  a  set  of  successive 
rotational positions of the driving wheel [6]. For this 
end, the theoretical tooth contact lines contained in 
the action plane are discretized in a some number of 
slices.  At  each  slice,  the  unknown  contact  load  is 
assumed  to  be  positive  or  zero  (column  vector  P). 
the

compliance square matrix, C, acting between slices. 
This  matrix  can  be  obtained  from  a  previous  3D 
finite element model of the mating teeth. It requires 
also  the  knowledge  of  manufacturing  errors  which 
are introduced as a column vector e of initial gap at 
each  slice.  Finally,  the  misalignment  measured  in 
the plane of pressure, (φ1-φ2) = φ, which is induced 
by the shafts, bearings and housing deformations, is 
taken  into  account  separately  from  vector  e.  The 
static teeth contact problem to solve can be written 
as follows: 

C P = d.i + e + φ.g   and   tP.I = N 

with   Pj ≥ 0

Here, d is the unknown STE, i is a column vector 
of ones, g is a column vector which localizes slices 
in  the  action  plane  and  N  is  the  total  normal  force 
transmitted  through  the  action  plane.  Under  some 
rearrangements,  equation  (1)  is  solved  by  using  a 
modified  simplex  method  [7].  The  computation 
directly  allows  to  obtain  the  STE  and  the  load 
distribution  along  contact 
the 
generalized forces Fk acting at each center Ok of the 

lines.  Then, 

mating  wheels  can  be  obtained  from  the  load 
distribution.  Finally,  the  meshing  stiffness  can  be 
computed  considering  an  increment  of  the  normal 
the  static 
force  (numerical  derivative  around 
condition).  As  the  STE,  meshing  stiffness  is  a 
periodic  function

variation of the number of in contact teeth pair.

the  generalized  inner  ring  displacement  xA  to  the

precise local displacement of the inner ring relative 
to  the  outer  ring  at  the  rolling  element.  Bearing

gives  complex  spectrum  of  the  response  at  each 
degree  of 
the  modeled  gearbox 
transmission. The computation time associated with 
this  method  is  about  100  times  shorter  than  that 
associated with standard numerical time integration 
schemes. Finally, the dynamic mesh load is deduced 
from the vibratory response.

3.1  Description of the gearbox 

A  single-stage  involute  helical  gear  has  been 
investigated. Description of the main characteristics 
is  given  in  Table  1.  The  design  load  for  this  gear 
pair is of 4000 N, which corresponds to a torque of 
152 Nm. In this analysis one of fourth of the design 
load  is  considered.  A  standard  profile  correction is 
introduced  consisting  on  tip  relieves  of  6  µm.  The 
gearbox  is  fitted  out  with  four  ball  bearings  which 
have  a  20°  nominal  contact  angles.  Shafts  are  40 
mm  diameter,  and  60  mm  length.  Gears  are 
localized  in  the  middle  shaft.  The  housing  has  a 
shape of a rectangular prism (190x120x100 mm, see 
figure 1). The finite element model of the housing is 
shown  in  figure  1.  The  overall  gearbox  model  has 
1600  elements  and  10000  degrees  of  freedom.  600 
master degrees of freedom are retained. The gearbox 
has  60  eigenmodes  in  the  frequency  range  0-5000 
Hz.

2.4  Critical modes 

The  computation  of  the  vibratory  response  of  the 
gearbox  induced  by  the  STE  requires  a  finite 
element  modeling  of  all  its  components,  i.e.  gear, 
shafts,  bearings  and  housing.  A  specific  12x12 
stiffness  matrix  couples  the  axial,  radial  and 
rotational motions of the driven wheel and those of 
the  driving  one.  This  matrix  is  derived  from  the 
above  calculation  and 
the  geometrical 
characteristics  of  the  gear  pair  [3,9].  Further, 
specific  5x5  stiffness  matrices  are  introduced  for 
modeling  the  bearings.  Considering  the  average 
time  meshing  stiffness,  one  can  obtained  the 
eigenmodes  of  the  overall  gearbox.  In  order  to 
extract  the  critical  modes,  an  energetic  coefficient, 
ρi,    representing  the  elastic  storage  in  the  meshing 
stiffness for each mode is calculated. The higher ρi 
is, the more critical the mode is [3,9].

Finally  critical  speed  ranges  are  obtained  with 
Tchebycheff’s inequality.

In  this  study,  lead  error,  shaft  misalignments

random  variables  in  the  tolerance  ranges.  The 
tolerance are chosen considering the quality class 7 
of  the  AFNOR  French  Standard  NF  E23-006.  This 
quality class is often used in industrial applications 
(gearbox,  machine  tool,…).  Preloads  on  each  shaft 
are  also  assumed  to  be  random  variables.  All  the 
parameters  are  assumed  to  be  truncated  gaussian 
parameters  with  a  tolerance  equal  to  6  times  the 
standard deviation. The two first statistical moments 
for  these  parameters  are  given  in  Table  2.  Mean 
values are considered as the deterministic case.

Although  this  range  is  overestimated,  its  length 
remains unnegligible.

As  we  can  see,  the  variability  of  the  first  critical 
mode  is  weak.  In  contrary,  variabilities  of  the 
second  and  the  third  critical  modes  are  strong. 
Considering 
natural 
frequencies and Tchebycheff’s inequality  leads to a 
range of 250 Hz for a 96% probability to be in this 
range.  Furthermore,  one  can  observe  a  very  large 
standard deviation of ρ2 and ρ3. In fact, there exists 
an energetic transfer between the two modes with a 
total  energetic  coefficient  (ρ2  +  ρ3)  remaining 
constant  to  63%.  This  leads  to  equal  standard 
deviations  for  ρ2  and  ρ3.  So  critical  speeds  take 
place 
large  range  of  rotational  speeds. 
Considering  excitation  of  these  modes  by  the  first 
harmonic  of  the  STE  and  using  the  Tchebycheff’s 
inequality with a 96% probability leads to a meshing 
frequency  over  312  Hz  (see  figure  3).  High 
variability of this critical speed and transfer between 
modes are illustrated in figure 4 where we show the 
dynamic  mesh  load  for  three  sets  of  parameters  H, 
P1 and P2.

Influence analysis 

It  is  interesting  now  to  estimate  influence  of  each 
fault  on  the  dispersion.  As  an  example,  figure  5 
shows in a graphical manner the nine samples which 
are  obtained  by  fixing  the  preload  P1.  More 
precisely,  every  point  corresponds  to  the  value  of 
the  frequency  of  the  second  critical  mode  for  one 
attempt  of  the  factorial  experiments.  Evolutions  of 
the  natural  frequency  are  quite  different  when  we 
change  the  level  of  the  helix  error.  This  result 
demonstrates  clearly  the  importance  of  interaction 
between  helix  error  and  preload.  Further,  the  helix 
error  is  a  dominant  parameter,  while  preload  can 
also play a relatively significant role. Also, one can 
notice that, when the helix error is zero, the natural 
frequency  has  very  little  variations.  Finally,  these 
results  have  been  observed  for  the  other  output 
parameters.

5  Conclusion 

In this study, we used statistical methods to describe 
the  variability  of  the  critical  speeds  of  a  gearbox 
fitted out with a single helical gear pair. 
Among  all,  the  geometry  faults  of  a  geared  system 
being  able  to  contribute  to  the  variability,  the 
analysis focused on three parameters : (i) total helix 
error  that  includes  misalignments  of  the  shaft  and 
the lead error, (ii) preload on the first shaft, and (iii) 
preload on the second shaft. 
Obtained  results 
to 
conclusions: 
•  Large variability of the static transmission error 

the  following  main 

lead 

• 

and meshing stiffness has been obtained. 
In  contrary,  bearings  stiffnesses  present  in  the 
studied case little dispersion. 

•  Large variability of critical speeds (speed range 
and levels) has been obtained. This results from 
variability  of  critical  modes  with  shape 
modifications  and  energy  transfer  between  one 
mode to an another mode. 

In future, it seems of interest to analyze effect of the 
design  (bearing  types,  shaft  length,  housing,  gear 
types,…) on the influence of the preload.

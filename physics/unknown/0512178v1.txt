Abstract:  Quantum  field  is  well  established  and  confirmed  by  experiments.  This  research 
establishes an operational measurement way to express the quantum field theory in a geometrical 
form. Based on the relationship among the space gauge and time gauge field, a finite geometrical 
field motion equation of quantum can be established based on the least action principle. This may 
be  valuable  for  understanding  the  underlying  concepts  of  quantum  matter  motion.  In 
four-dimensional  spacetime  continuum,  the  orthogonal  rotation  is  defined.  It  forms  two  sets  of 
equations:  one  set  is  geometrical  equations,  another  set  is  the  motion  equations.  The  Lorentz 
transformation  can  be  directly  derived  from  the  geometrical  equations,  and  the  proper  time  of 
general  relativity  is  well  expressed  by  time  displacement  field.  By  the  motion  equations,  the 
typical  time  displacement  field  of  matter  motion  is  discussed.  The  research  shows  that  the 
quantum field theory can be established based on the concept of orthogonal rotation. On this sense, 
the quantum matter motion in physics is viewed as the orthogonal rotation (a special deformation) 
of spacetime continuum caused by basic solution of time displacement. In this paper, it shows that 
there  are  three  typical  quantum  solutions.  One  is  particle-like  solution,  one  is  generation-type 
solution,  and  one  is  pure  wave  type  solution.  For  each  typical  solution,  the  force  fields  are 
different.  When  the  quantum  solutions  are  given,  the  force  fields  may  have  different  features. 
Many features of quantum field can be well explained by this theoretic form. Finally, the quantum 
field, gravity field, and electrical field are considered in an united form, temporally the united field 
is  named  as  cosmic  field  as  in  essence  it  will  leads  to  the  concept  of  absolute  spacetime.  The 
general matter motion is discussed, the main conclusions are: (1). Geometrically, cosmic vacuum 
field  can  be  described  by  the  curvature  spacetime,  such  as  Minkowski  world;  (2).  The  spatial 
deformation  of  planet  is  related  with  a  planet  electromagnetic  field.  Further  more,  the  research 
shows that the volume variation will cause the harmonic vibration of time displacement; (3). For 
electric  charge  less  matter,  the  volume  of  matter  will  be  expanding  infinitely.  This  may  be  the 
intrinsic explanation about the Big-ban when the matter is in cosmic background (scale); (4).For 
strong electric charge matter, it shows that the volume of matter will be contracting infinitely. This 
may  be  the  intrinsic  explanation about  the  Black-hole when  the  matter  is  in  cosmic  background 
(scale).

1. Introduction 

In  the  papers  “Inertial  System  and  Special  Relativity”  [1]  and  “Gravity  Field  and 
Electromagnetic  Field”  [2],  the  symmetric  matter  motion  transformation  and  pure  time 
displacement field are discussed. In this paper, the anti-symmetric motion transformation will be

discussed.   

For  any  rank-two  tensor,  it  can  be  divided  into  the  sum  of  a  symmetric  tensor  and  an 
anti-symmetric  tensor.  According  to  our  previous  research  results,  the  symmetric  tensor 
corresponds  to  Newtonian  matter  motion.  The  pure  time  displacement  field  is  a  non-symmetric 
tensor, it has been treated as the conservative and electromagnetic fields. For the matter motion in 
the  general  motion  forms,  as  the  symmetric  part  corresponds  to  Newtonian  matter  motion 
discussed earlier, this part will discusses the anti-symmetric form of matter motion tensor. 

Based  on  Chen  Zhida’s  research,  the  anti-symmetric  tensor  corresponds  to  an  orthogonal 

rotation tensor [3-4]. According to this formulation mechanism, a general rank-two tensor 

i

jF   in 

three dimensional space, say the motion transformation tensor, can be expressed by the gradient of 

displacement

where,

  express  the  covariant  derivation  of  displacement  fields; 

i

jδ   is  Kronecker-delta. 

Note that for three dimensional space

. 

Chen  Z  D  has  shown  that  the  transformation  can  be  decomposed  into  the  addition  of  one 
symmetry  tensor  expressing  stretching  and  one  unit  orthogonal  tensor  expressing  local  rotation 
[3-4]. That is:

In  this  paper,  the  concept  of  orthogonal  rotation  will  be  extended  to  four-dimensional 
spacetime continuum for simple cases in an operational way. To get its intrinsic meaning please 
refer the Appendix A (Mathematic Feature of Deformation Tensor) for three-dimensional case. 

the  Lorentz 

This idea of orthogonal rotation in four-dimensional spacetime is well supported by Lorentz 
transformation,  as 
in 
four-dimensional spacetime on mathematic sense. However, as the previous research has shown, 
the Lorentz transformation is correct conditionally and cannot be the intrinsic feature to express 
such a kind of general rotation of matter motion. 

transformation  forms  a  rotational 

invariant  group 

For our purpose, the Lorentz transformation will be derived from the least action principle for 

orthogonal rotation motion transformation. Firstly, the basic equations are reviewed simply.   

The matter motion in four-dimensional spacetime continuum is defined by:

physical measuring system. Its three dimenssional case has been studied by Chen Zhida [3-4]. 
 
Generally,  the  matter  motion  transformation  tensor  is  non-commutative.  Its  covariant  index

However, if one does care how the original matter motion state is in the absolute spacetime, 
then the initial matter itself can be generally defined as the initial co-moving coordinator system. 

In this case, 

F

defines the incremental motion transformation. Of course, the selection of the 

~

initial co-moving coordinator system can make if the reference matter is isotropic:

with vacuum or ether. 

On this sense, the initial matter is taken to define the spacetime continuum where the matter 
incremental  deformation  under  discussion  is  taking  place.  Of  course,  by  such  a  selection,  the 

gauge 

ijg   is determined by our selection. Therefore, 

ijg   is arbitrary and has eight independent

parameters which are completely determined by the reference matter state. 
 

The  principle  of  physical  laws  covariant  invariance  requires  the  general  reference  matter 

motion be coordinator independent. To meet these requirements, the tensor

tensor. Therefore, one has:

(23) 

where,  λ  and  µ  are  the  intrinsic  feature  of  matter  referring  to  reference  matter.  For  Newton 

mechanics, the reference matter is vacuum or ether. For the isotropic tensor in mixture form please 
refer [8]. In standard physical theory, the mixed form is refused. However, the research shows that 
the  mixture  form  is  necessary  to  show  the  non-commutative  feature  of  matter  motion 
transformation tensor. (refer, Appendix A (Mathematic Feature of Deformation Tensor)). 

  When  the  tensor 

  has  non-symmetric  components,  no  matter  what  coordinator 

system is selected as the initial co-moving coordinator system, the tensor 

F

, in general case, 

~

For  four  dimensional  spacetime,  the  equation  should  be  true  also.  Note  that  here  the  covariant 
force is defined as: 

This  equation  defines  the  covariant  force.  On  this  sense,  the  motion  equation  (24)  is  the 
contra-covariant form motion equation. 
Based  on  Chen  Zhida’s  research,  geometrically,  the  equation  (18)  corresponds  to  the  total 
 
force along a special direction while the equation (24) corresponds to the total force on a special 
surface. For deformable matter space, they are not the same. Only for the standard Cartesian space, 
they are the same. 
 
For  a  given  matter,  to  make  the  equation  (22)  be  effective,  the  initial  co-moving 
coordinator  system  must  be  a  general  Riemannian  spacetime.  In  this  case,  according  to  the 
definition equation (15) there are relation equations:

Based on the motion equations, the paper will firstly discuss the orthogonal rotation of rigid 
 
matter bady in four-dimensional spacetime. The results show that the Lorentz transformation is the 
natural results if motion is measured in inertial motion concept. Further more, the research shows 
that  the  Newtonian  moment  space  is  equivalent  with  the  wave-number  space,  so  this  basic 
relations  between  the  classical  mechanics  and  the  quantum  mechanics  is  naturally  derived  from 
the  least  action  principle  for  orthogonal  rotation  motion.  Secondly,  the  orthogonal  rotation  for 
space-deformable  matter  is  discussed,  which  leads  to  the  non-linear  equation  of  quantum 
mechanics. Finally, the basic four force in nature are discussed in details to show the basic features 
of cosmic field, which is defined by the general form of motion transformation.

rotational  deformation  of  continuum  in  three  dimensional  space  [3-4].  As

,  the

equation (50-2) shows that the rotation angular time variation is determined by cosmic force. This 
phenomena can be observed or be used to explain the planet rotation with the rotation angular time 
variation.

This  is  the  shear  wave  equation  for  elastic  continuum,  however  please  note  that  for  classical 
elastic  continuum  the  parameter 
,( µλ   are  defined on  the matter  itself  at  initial  state. As  here, 

)

the parameters are defined respect with vacuum or ether, the equation (51-1) describes the planet 

8

 

 

 

 

shear motion, that is, the variation of planet rotation in cosmic background. 
 
The equation (50-4) shows that the relation between the time variation of rotation angular and 
the volume variation is determined by cosmic force. It relates the spatial volume variation with the 
rotation  angular  variation.  This  can  be  used  to  explain  that  how  the  planet  volume  variation  is 
companied with rotation angular velocity.

Recalling  that  µ   is  related  with  Newtonian  mass  quantity,  the 

µλ+

  is  related  with 

Coulomb  charge,  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  Newtonian  matter  rotation  not  only  depends  on  its 
Newtonian mass but also depends on its Coulomb charge.   

When

f =

, 

4,3,2,1=i

, the equation (51) becomes Euler rigid rotation equation. 

Summering  above  results  about  Newtonian  matter  rotation  in  vacuum  or  ether,  it  can  be 
 
concluded  that  the  Euler  rotation  equation  for  rigid  body  is  the  only  rotation  mode  when  the 
reference  matter  is  vacuum  or  Cartesian  spacetime.  Therefore,  for  curvature  spacetime,  that  is, 
when  the  real  cosmic  field  is  in  consideration,  the  equations  (50)  can  be  used.  Therefore,  this 
results may be valuable for astronomy research and cosmics study. In fact, the equation (50) can 
be used to explain the so-called self rotation of spaceship, and so can be used to control to flight of 
spaceship.

By  equation  (57-2),  in  conservative  matter  field,  the  velocity  square  is  constant.  From  this 

 
point to see, the kinetic energy conservation is only effective for conservative field matter.

(A). Constant Time Speed Matter (Conservative Matter Field Approximation) 

 
 
  When  the  time  speed  is  constant,  the  parameter  η  is  constant  about  time.  The  equation 

4u   has three typical solutions [1-2].   

(57-2) shows that the matter must have an absolute velocity respect with reference matter (vacuum 
or  ether).  The  equation  (57-4)  shows  that  the  magnetic  vector  potential  is  non  zero.  In  fact,  the 
equation  (57-1)  shows  that  the  magnetic  vector  potential  is  produced  by  the  local  rotation  of 
matter. This can be used to explain the magnetic related with the self-rotation of quantum matter. 
 
Taking Newtonian approximation, its motion equation is described by equations (50). Once 
the macro velocity and rotation are gotten, the equations (57) show that there must exist an static 
magnetic  field.  Therefore,  any  planet  must  have  static  magnetic  field.  Further  more,  the  static 
magnetic field can exist for particles also.

For planets, such as the Earth, the rotation velocity is completely determined by the gravity field 
( M is  negative).  For  the  electrons,  the  rotation  velocity  is  completely  determined  by  the  total 
charge  of  electrons.  On  the  other  hand,  the  negative  Newtonian  matter  ( M is  positive)  and  the 
positive  Coulomb  charge  (positive  electro  or  nucleus)  have  no  macro  rotation.  Please  note  this 
conclusion is limited to conservative field.   
 
For the negative Newtonian matter ( M is positive) and the positive Coulomb charge (positive 
electro or nucleus), if they have rotation, their momentum must be imaginary. For such a case, the 
matter must be in spatial local form, that is:

In quantum mechanics, such a solution corresponds to the weak interaction of nucleus. Based on 
this  research,  the  weak  interaction  has  no  macro  rotation  representation.  Hence,  the  weak 
interaction  is  not  directly  observable  by  kinetic  motion.  In  fact,  the  weak  interaction  is  inferred 
from the quantum effects. 
 
For the non-linear exact form (60), what solutions are possible is determined from geometric 
consideration. The basic conclusion is that: some matter can have rotational motion, some matter 
cannot have rotational motion. In quantum mechanics, some particles have self-rotation, but some 
particles have no self-rotation. 
 
 
Therefore, the cosmic world is a self-rotation world. 
 
 

Please note that, the rotation is determined by the matter itself, so its intrinsic rotation. 
Generally  speaking  from  above  research,  any  Newtonian  matter  planet  has  self-rotation. 

(B). Quantum Wave Matter 
The quantum wave matter can be introduced by the form solution of time displacement as: 

In this research, the physical component is defined by the real parts. As usual custom, this point 
will not be mentioned in related equations.

For  a  given  wave  matter,  by  these  equations  the  macro  motion  is  completely  determined.
 Based this understanding, the quantum matter motion is deterministic rather than probability-type 
non-deterministic. 

As  the  energy  and  wave  function  are  not  zero,  the  above  equations  show  that  the  macro 
velocity and macro local rotation are always non zero. Therefore, the macro motion is measurable 
for quantum matter motion. 

 
displacement  spatial  gradient 

In  fact,  the  equations  (48)  and  (49)  show  that  the  macro  velocity 

iV   and  the  micro  time 
iv   are  reciprocal  items.  In  this  sense,  the  quantum  matter  has 

particle representation and matter wave representation.

It shows that pure space rotation is equivalent with a homogenous field.   

Such a kind of matter may be the so-called dark matter as it is non-visible under the sense of 

Newtonian matter has mass. Or it may be interpreted as cosmic microwave radiation matter. 

Note  that  when  the  rotation  angular  has  spatial  variation,  it  is  equivalent  with  a  static 
electrical potential field. When the rotation angular is time dependent, magnetic-like field will be 
produced.

Geometrically,  cosmic  field  can  be  described  by  the  curvature  spacetime,  such  as  Minkowski 
world.   
 

Therefore,  the  cosmic  can  be  described  by  the  equation  (74)  with  one  parameter  Θ ,  as  an 

pure rotational space. If one views that the Lorentz rotation group as such a kind of matter, then 
this matter is identified by the effectiveness of Lorentz transformation.   
 
For such a kind of matter, its motion respect with absolute spacetime (ether) is determined by 
parameter  λ,  this  parameter  can  not  be  detected  by  the  spacetime  curvature.  To  detect  this 
parameter, strong action is required. On this sense, the parameter  λ  is action related. 

 

In  fact,  in  previous  research,  when 

Action

(

)

  is  taken  as  the  reference  matter,  the 

~
i
jF

parameters action-dependent of reference matter is implied. 
Summering above discussion, the Lorentz rotational invariance group indeed represents the 
 
general  feature  of  cosmic  spacetime.  So,  the  basis  of  general  relativity  is  supported  by  this 
research. However, this research does not support such a world as the unique solution of cosmic 
world. 

  When  the  matter  deformations  are  highly  shear,  the 

i

. 

The  related  equations  can  be  modified  accordingly.  Generally,  for  many  body  problems,  this 
orthogonal definition is essential.

For  the  equation  (77-1),  when  the  intrinsic  spatial  deformation  is  zero,  it  is  Newton 
acceleration equation. When the spatial forces are zero, the spatial deformation and acceleration is 
related by equation: 

It means that in zero gravity condition, all Newtonian matter has mass-independent motion. 
 
mass is large enough, it can be simplified as: 

The equation (77-2) in  fact is  the quantum  wave  equation  for  Newtonian  matter. When  the 

It gives out the classical gravity field solution. 
 
The  equation  (77-3)  shows  that  the  spatial  deformation  is  related  with  an  electromagnetic 
field. This explains the planet electromagnetic field. The equation (77-4) shows that the volume 
variation will cause the harmonic vibration of time displacement.

explanation about the Black-hole when the matter is in cosmic background (scale). 
 
6. Conclusion 

The  rotational  motion  is  discussed  in  this  part.  The  related  geometrical  equations  form  the 
intrinsic geometrical equations for quantum mechanics in finite geometrical field theory of matter 
motion. For the Newtonian matter rotation in vacuum or ether, it can be concluded that the Euler 
rotation equation for rigid body is the only rotation mode when the reference matter is vacuum or 
Cartesian spacetime. Therefore, for curvature spacetime, that is, when the real cosmic field is in 
consideration, the related equations (can be used to explain the so-called self rotation of spaceship, 
and so can be used to control to flight of spaceship) may be valuable for astronomy research and 
cosmic study. The shear-wave-like feature of electromagnetic field is explained. 

In this research, the reference matter invariance, that is the invariant of  η, is equivalent with 

the  proper  time  invariant  in  general  relativity.  In  fact,  this  equation  explains  the  true  physical 
meaning  of  Lorentz  transformation.  Please  remember  that  the  Lorentz  electromagnetic  wave 
equation  is  taken  the  cosmic  background  as  the  reference  matter.  Generally  speaking  from  the 
research,  any  Newtonian  matter  planet  has  self-rotation.  Therefore,  the  cosmic  world  is  a 
self-rotation world. Weak interaction is introduced as an approximation. 
The general matter motion is discussed, the main conclusions are: 
 
(1). For the case 

0=µ , there exists a space rotation field. For this matter field, the Lorentz 

rotational  invariance  group  indeed  represents  the  general  feature  of  cosmic  spacetime.  So,  the 
basis of general relativity is supported by this research. However, this research does not support 
such  a  world  as  the  unique  solution  of  cosmic  world.  The  research  shows  that  such  a  kind  of 
matter may be the so-called dark matter as it is non-visible under the sense of Newtonian matter 
has mass. Or it may be interpreted as cosmic microwave radiation matter. The research discovers 
that when the rotation angular has spatial variation, it is equivalent with a static electrical potential 
field.  When  the  rotation  angular  is  time  dependent,  magnetic-like  field  will  be  produced. 
Geometrically,  cosmic  vacuum  field  can  be  described  by  the  curvature  spacetime,  such  as 
Minkowski world. 

(2).  For  the  case 

0=λ ,  it  gives  out  the  classical  gravity  field  solution.  The  research  also 

shows  that  the  spatial  deformation  is  related  with  an  electromagnetic  field.  This  explains  the 
planet electromagnetic field. Further more, the research shows that the volume variation will cause 

 

17

the harmonic vibration of time displacement.   

(3).  For  the  case 

µλ −=

,  it  shows  that  the  volume  of  matter  will  be  expanding  infinitely. 

This may be the intrinsic explanation about the Big-ban when the matter is in cosmic background 
(scale). 

(4).For the case 

µλ=

, it shows that the volume of matter will be contracting infinitely. This 

may  be  the  intrinsic  explanation about  the  Black-hole when  the  matter  is  in  cosmic  background 
(scale).

  Mathematic Feature of Deformation Tensor 

For  continuum,  each  material  point  can  be  parameterized  with  continuous  coordinators 

, =ix i

3,2,1

.  When  the  coordinators  are  fixed  for  each  material  point  no  matter  what  motion  or 

deformation happens, the covariant gauge field 

ijg   at time  t   will define the configuration in the 

time.  The  continuous  coordinators  endowed  with  the  gauge  field  tensor  define  a  co-moving 
dragging coordinator system. 

The initial configuration gauge

ijg   defines a distance geometric invariant:

Hence,  the  transformation 

jF   relates  the  initial  contra-variant  base  vectors  with  current 

contra-variant base vectors in such a way that: 

Therefore,  the  transformation 

i

jF   is  a  mixture  tensor.  Its  lower  index  represents  covariant 

component

its  upper 

index  represents  contra-variant  component

Similar discussion shows that the local transformation

jG   is a mixture tensor, lower index 

represents  covariant  component  in 

ijg   configuration,  upper  index  represents  contra-variant 

component in 

ijg   configuration. It is easy to find that:

(A-13) 

(A-14) 

(A-15) 

Bt these equations, 

jF   can be explained as the extended-Kronecker-delta in that it’s the dot 

i

product of contra-variant base vector in initial configuration and covariant base vector in current 
configuration. When the two configurations are the same, it becomes the standard Kronecker-delta. 

For the 

jG , similar interpretation can be made. 

i

From  these  equations  to  see,  geometrically,  it  is  found  that  the 

i

jF   measures  the  current 

covariant base vector with the initial contra-variant base vector as reference. When stress tensor is 
defined as:

(
k

−

)

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A-16) 

Its mechanic meaning can be explained as the lower index represents component of surface force 
in current direction, and the upper index represents the initial surface normal which surface force 
acts on. It takes the initial surface as surface force reference.   

The 

jG measures the initial covariant base vector with the current contra-variant base vector 

i

as reference. The corresponding stress can be explained as the lower index represents component 
of  surface  force  in  initial  direction,  and  the  upper  index  represents  the  current  surface  normal 
which surface force acts on. 
 
For  such  a  kind  of  mixture  tensor,  it  is  defined  on  the  same  point  with  different 
configurations (that is initial and current). So, the name of two-point tensor given by C Truessdell 
is  not  correct.  This  mis-interpretation  has  caused  many  doubts  cast  on  the  feature  of 
transformation tensor. Some mathematician even said that the mixture tensor is meaningless.   
 
However,  during  treating  the  non-symmetric  field  theory,  Einstein  believes  that  the  use  of 
mixture tensor is more reasonable that the pure covariant or pure contra-variant tensor. Recently, 
the concept of bi-tensor is introduced in physics topic. So, we have sound reason to use mixture 
tensor in continuum mechanics, as it can give clear physical meaning for the definition of stress. 

Note that the transformation 

jF   is completely determined by the deformation measured in 

i

initial configuration with gauge tensor

0

ijg . Mathematically, the covariant differentiation is taken in 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20

the  initial  geometry  also,  although  the  physical  meaning  of 

i

jF   is  that  it  relates  two 

configurations. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is valuable to point out that, if the initial coordinator system is taken as Cartesian system, 

the 

jF   can be transformed into pure covariant form:

(A-18) 

Although  it  is  acceptable  in  form  for  the  special  case  of  taking  Cartesian  system  as  the  initial 
coordinator system, the intrinsic meaning of deformation tensor is completely destroyed by such a 
formulation. That may be the main reason for the rational mechanics constructed by C Truessdell 
et al in 1960s. 
  Mathematically,  once  the  initial  gauge  field  is  selected,  the  current  gauge  field  is  to  be 
obtained by the given physical deformation. In this sense, the current gauge field is viewed as the 
physical field. So, the covariant differentiation is taken respect with the initial configuration. 
Truessdell  argued  that  the  covariant  differentiation  should  be  taken  one  index  in  initial 
 
configuration,  another  index  in  current  configuration.  This  concept  had  strongly  effects  on  the 
development of infinite deformation mechanics. Such a kind of misunderstanding indeed is caused 
by the equations (A17-18). 
 
Historically,  Chen  Zhida  is  the  first  one  to  clear  the  ambiguity  caused  by  equations  (A-17) 
and (A-18) systematically. His monograph “Rational Mechanics”(1987) treats this topic in depth.   
 
There are many critics about the mathematics used in Chen’s rational mechanics theory. The 
most comment one is that: for a coordinator transformation

be  invariant.  Such  a  tensor  describes  a  continuum  without  any  motion.  In  fact,  such  a  tensor 
feature is only to say the object indifference for coordinator system selection. 
 

However,  many  physicists  and  mechanists  treat  motion  of  continuum  as  the  transformation

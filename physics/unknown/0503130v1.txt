Abstract:  Time  domain  deBroglie wave interferometry  [Cahn  et  al,  Phys. Rev.  Lett. 79,  784]  is 

applied to Rb87 atoms in a 2D linear trap. A standing wave light field is carefully aligned along the 

guiding direction of the magnetic trapping potential generated by a soft-ferromagnetic 4-foil structure. 

A  sequence  of  two  standing  wave  pulses  is  applied  to  the  magnetically  trapped  atoms.  The 

backscattered  light  at  the  revival  time  is  collected  and  detected  via  a  heterodyning  technique.  Our 

interferometer signal shows recoil oscillations that precisely fit the interferometer theory for atoms in 

free space. We observe decay of the signal on a millisecond time scale , as well as millisecond scale 

oscillations that suggest a residual variation of the linear trapping potential along the standing wave 

direction.

I. Introduction:   

An ability to coherently control the motion of atoms close to a surface may eventually lead to the 

realization  of  chip-based  atom  interferometric  devices  for  precise  measurements  and  quantum 

computing.  Although  significant  progress  has  been  achieved  in  developing  the  building  blocks  of 

these  devices,  in  most  cases  the  external  motion  of  the  trapped  atoms  in  the  chip  potential  can  be 

modeled  using  only  classical  mechanics.  [1-6].  A  major  difficulty  associated  with  chip  based  atom 

interferometry  is  the  realization  of  a  chip-based  beamsplitter  that  generates  a  mutual  coherence 

between the trapped atoms [7, 8]. Atom beamsplitters are more difficult to create than atom traps or 

guides  because  a  potential  that  splits  the  trapped  atoms  needs  to  have  sharp  features  comparable  or 

even smaller than the de Broglie wavelength of the trapped atoms, requiring either very cold atoms or 

potentials that vary substantially over a micron. The size scale of the variation in the potential due to 

an  atom  chip  can  be  reduced  by  trapping  atoms  closer  to  the  chip,  but  bringing  atoms  closer  to  the 

chip  surface  can  reduce  interferometer  performance  because  unwanted  potential  variations  due  to 

fabrication  errors  become  more  important  and  the  coupling  of  the  atoms  to  various  surface  noise 

channels  increases  [9,  10].    The  problem  is  easily  circumvented  if  the  splitting  potential  is  instead 

generated by an optical standing wave above the chip surface, as demonstrated in a recent experiment, 

where standing wave pulses coherently manipulated the guided motion of a Bose-Einstein condensate 

on a chip [11].   

A  Bose  condensed  atom  sample  provides  a  sample  size  limited  coherence  length  that  may  be 

useful for interferometery; however, the atom-atom interactions of a condensate contribute additional 

challenges  to  an  interferometric  experiment.  In  this  paper  we  describe  experiments  using  a  trapped 

 

2

atom sample that is far from quantum degeneracy, where we study the motion of the atoms in a 2D 

magnetic trap using the time-domain deBroglie wave interferometry technique [12, 13]. At short times 

scales (<< 1ms), our interferometer signal shows recoil oscillations in the contrast of the  λ/2 atom 

density grating due to the interference of guided atom wavepackets with themselves, which precisely 

fits  the  predictions  of  interferometer  theory  for  atoms  in  free  space.  The  influence  of  the  trapping 

potential on the interferometer signal appears on a millisecond scale, when the motion of the atoms 

along  the  standing  wave  direction  is  significantly  perturbed  by  the  residual  trapping  potential.  This 

time scale is set by the misaligning angle between the standing wave direction and the guide direction, 

which  cannot  be  adjusted  to  zero  in  this  experiment  due  to  the  finite  spreading  of  our  atom  sample 

along  the  slightly  curved  guide.  Nevertheless,  our  results  indicate  the  feasibility  of  using  standing 

waves to coherently manipulate the guided motion of cold atoms in a magnetic trap. We also notice 

that  by  confining  the  atoms  in  a  guiding  potential,  the  interrogation  time  of  a  light  pulse  atom 

interferometer  may  be  significantly  increased,  resulting  in  improvements  in  the  sensitivity  and 

accuracy of guided measurements in comparison with those conducted in free space. 

The remainder of the paper is organized in 3 parts. In part II we briefly review the theory of a 

time domain de Broglie interferometer, and discuss the generalization of the formula to a magnetically 

trapped atom sample. A formula that describes the leading order influence of a 2D linear trap on the 

interferometer signal is then derived. In part III, we describe the experimental setup, and in part VI we 

present the experimental results.

II. Time domain de Broglie wave interferometer with trapped atoms 

Time  domain  deBroglie  wave  interferometry  was  first  demonstrated  by  Cahn  et  al  [12]:  an 

off-resonant standing wave made of two traveling light beams with wave vector k1 and k2 is pulsed on 

an cold atom cloud twice, with pulse areas 1θ and 

2θ   separated by time T, before a probe light with 

the wave vector k1 is switched on at time 2T+t and the backscattered light with the wave vector k2 is 

collected  and  detected.  We  refer  readers  to  [12,  13]  for  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  theory  of  the 

interferometer. Here we go directly to the expression for the backscattered signal.

sample  with  spatial  spreading  much  larger  than  the  light  wavelength  and  a  thermal  deBroglie 

wavelength much smaller than the light wavelength, 

k∆ρ can be approximated with:

Here  ρ  is  the  atom  density,  u  is  the  mean  thermal  velocity  of  the  atoms, 

rω is  the  angular  recoil

Thus  the  recoil  frequency 

rω as  well  as  the  acceleration  a  can  be  measured  by  measuring  the 

backscattered light in repeated experiments while varying the interrogation time 2T and the probe time 

t [14].   

Unlike the case of a uniform linear potential where the potential variation preserves the amplitude of 

the  backscattered  signal  while  shifting  its  phase,  the  presence  of  a  general  potential  V(r)  across  the 

atom sample usually degrades the amplitude of the backscattering signal. If V(r) is weak and smooth, 

the leading order correction to the backscattering signal can be calculated by spatially averaging the 

phase factor in (2’) across the atom sample:

Equation (3) becomes a good approximation when V(r) is smooth enough such that for most atoms the 

acceleration along the standing wave direction is a constant during the interrogation time 2T. 

Our interferometer experiment confines atoms in a cylindrically symmetric magnetic field with a 

field  minimum  at  r=0.    The  standing  wave  direction,  e.g.,  the  direction  of 

=k∆k

2-k1,  is  carefully 

aligned to be parallel with the magnetic guiding direction. Thus equation (3) can be applied even in 

the  presence  of  tight  transverse  confinement.  To  illustrate  the  idea,  consider  an  atom  with  magnetic 

moment  µ  confined  in  a  linear  2D  magnetic  guide  with  the  magnetic  field  given  in  Cartesian 

coordinates  by  B  =

Together, (1), (3) and (4) imply that for 2D trapped atoms, the misalignment of the standing wave with 

respect  to  the  guiding  direction  introduces  an  additional  modulation  on  the  amplitude  of  the 

backscattering  signal  as  a  function  of  2T,  that  is  oscillating  and  decaying  on  the  time  scale  of 

2T~

.  In  particular,  the  amplitude  of  the  backscattering  signal  should  have  a  node  at 

, with which the argument in (4’’) equals the first zero of the Bessel function. 

Before moving on to a detailed discussion of the experiment, we would like to emphasize that the 

1D interferometer theory has to be applied to the magnetically trapped atoms with care. Although for 

far  off-resonant  standing  waves  the influence of  the  Zeeman  shift on  the  light  shift  potential  can be 

safely ignored, the tensorial nature of the pulsed light shift potential indicates a polarization dependent

pulse  area  across  the  trapped  atom  sample  and  possible  spin-flips  for  atoms  in  weak  field  regions. 

These unwanted nonlinear effects can be carefully avoided in different ways, and in particular, can be 

eliminated for alkaline atoms by choosing linearly polarized, far-off - resonant light [15].   

 

 

III. The Experimental setup 

III.1 In situ loading of atoms in a magnetic guide[16]

We  use  a  4-foil  magnetic  structure  to  generate  the  2D  quadruple  magnetic  field  for  the  2D+ 

magneto-optical  trap  as  well  as  the  magnetic confining  potential.  The structure  is composed  of four 

0.5mm  thick,  65mm  long  by  31mm  wide  rectangularµ-metal  foils  that  are  placed  parallel  to  each 

other with 5mm separations (see fig.1a). The current sheets run through the wires around the foils pull 

the 4 foils up and down alternatively to generate a 2D quadruple magnetic field on top of the 4-foil 

structure. By increasing the magnetization of the two inner foils and the two outer foils in proportion, 

the magnetic field gradient at the 2D field strength minimum can be varied while the position of the 

minimum remains fixed.   

About  108  Rb87  atoms  are  cooled  and  trapped  from  the  background  vapor  by  a  2D+ 

magneto-optical  trap  (MOT),  6mm  away  from  the  foil  structure.  In  the  last  12ms  of  the  MOT 

operation, first the magnetic field gradient ramps from 20G/cm to B1 (up to 100G/cm) in 10ms, while 

the  cooling  laser  intensity  is  reduced  and  detuned  for  polarization  gradient  cooling.  The  repumping 

laser is switched off in the last 1ms before the MOT light is switched off, resulting in approximately 3 

  10×

7  atoms  in  F=1 hyperfine  states trapped in  the magnetic potential.  The transverse  width  of the 

atom distribution is around 200µm at a magnetic gradient B1=50G/cm, and is inversely proportional 

7

to B1. The trapped atoms have a mean longitudinal velocity u ~ 5cm/s that is roughly 8 times the recoil 

velocity  of  the  atoms.  The  guided  motion  of  atoms  in  the  magnetic  trap  can  be  studied  by  taking 

absorption images from the side of the trap in repeated experiments, as shown in fig 1.b. 

After  the  atoms  have  been  transferred  to  the  magnetic  trap,  we  wait  for  a  time  tesc  for  the 

untrapped  atoms  to  escape  the  trap  region,  and  perform  the  standing  wave  experiment  with  the 

magnetically  trapped  atoms.  tesc  has  been  sampled  from  3ms  to  30ms,  where  tesc>9ms  is  enough  to 

eliminate the contribution of residual untrapped atoms to the backscattering signal. 

III.2 The standing wave experiment 

The standing wave is composed of two traveling laser beams that overlap at the atom trap region 

with an intersection angle 

  around 90mrad. The two beams, which will be referred as I

1 and I2, are 

Θ

independently controlled by acousto-optical modulators, and have a 1/e2 diameter of 4mm and 2mm 

respectively.  The  standing  wave  light  is  136Mhz  blue  detuned  relative  to  the  Rb87  D2  F=1  –  F’=2 

transition.  While  keeping  the  direction  of  I2  fixed,  the  direction  of  I1  can  be  adjusted  to  tune  the 

standing wave direction relative to the magnetic guide direction (see fig.2).   

Two 600ns standing wave pulses separated by time T are applied to the atom sample. The pulse 

area for both pulses are estimated to be  θ=2.5. I1 is then switched on as the probe light from 2T-4µs 

for  more  than  100 µs,  during  which  the  backscattered  light  is  continuously  collected  with  the 

detecting optics. In a time-domain deBroglie wave interferometer experiment, the backscattered signal 

light shares the same propagation direction as one of the traveling wave beams forming the standing 

wave. The detecting optics setup requires extra care due to the fact that the traveling wave beam can 

be orders of magnitude stronger than the signal light. In our experiment (see fig.2), a 40Mhz AOM is 

 

8

used  as  a  protective  shutter  before  the  detecting  photodiode,  and  is  switched  on  only  when  I2  is 

switched  off.  Further,  to  detect  the  nanowatt  level  signal  light,  I2  is  attenuated  more  than  70dB  by 

switching off its controlling AOMs during the probe time. 

The backscattered light is mixed with an optical local field at a different frequency and collected 

with  a  single-mode  optical  fiber  that  delivers  the  light  to  a  fast  avalanche  photodiode  (APD).  The 

mixed  electronic  signal  from  the  APD  is  further  mixed  down  to  40Mhz,  and  put  into  a  Tektronix 

digital oscilloscope. The amplitude of the backscattering signal is retrieved by using the oscilliscope’s 

native FFT to measure the component of the electronic signal at frequencies near 40Mhz. The standing 

wave  experiment  setup  is  summarized  in  fig.2;  we  also  show  a  typical  FFT  signal  from  a  single 

iteration  of  the  experiment.  The time  domain  de Broglie  interferometer is completed  by  varying the 

interrogation time 2T in repeated experiment while recording the peak value of the FFT signal.   

III.3 Automation 

Standard  laboratory  automation  techniques  are  used  to  simplify  the  process  of  observing  the 

backscattered light at different interrogation times 2T. The automation process used in this experiment 

consists of three parts: two experimental control subprograms and a data reduction script.   

The first subprogram is a LabView VI that provides the timing sequence for individual iterations 

of the experiment. The MOT light intensity and frequency, repump light intensity, and magnetic coil 

currents are controlled by a National Instruments PCI-6713 analog output card. Additionally, one of 

the card’s analog outputs is used to provide a timed TTL trigger to initiate the standing wave sequence. 

The second subprogram is a Visual Basic DLL that runs between iterations of the experiment. After 

communicating with the oscilloscope to download the previous iteration’s FFT waveform, it averages 

 

9

that waverform with the previous waveforms at the same inter-pulse spacing T. After performing the 

required number of averaging, it performs a set of GPIB calls that set a new value for T and for related 

parameters.  The  different  values  for  T  can  be  run  in  a  random  order  to  reduce  the  effects  of  slow 

variations  in  the  experimental  conditions.  Depending  on  the  quality  of  the  signal  in  different 

experimental situation, the number of averaged iterations has been set from 2 to 36. 

The  data  reduction  script  is  a  macro  for  Origin  7  that  extracts  the  peak  values  of  the 

backscattering amplitude for each averaged FFT waveform. After doing this, it generates a spreadsheet 

giving the amplitudes of the backscattering signals from experiments with different interrogation times 

2T.     

 

IV. Results and discussion 

We begin the description of our experimental results with a data set that samples 2T from 0.2ms 

to 0.6 ms in 2µs separations (Fig. 3a). The standing wave experiments are taken out with B1=20G/cm 

and tesc =3ms. Since the magnetic field is unaltered during the whole experiment, the experiment can 

be repeated with a repetition rate as high as 5Hz. The recoil oscillation in Fig. 3 a) agrees well with the 

theory described in part II, e.g., <|E(2T, t)|>t~ |

|. The optical pumping effect can be 

included in the model described in part II by including a small imaginary part to the pulse area  θ[17]. 

Fig 3d) shows a simulation result on the experimental curve based on the simply model with  θ  set to 

be 2.6 + 0.08i. A comparison between the experimental curve in fig 3.b) and the simulation curve in 

fig  3.d)  shows  that  on  a  short  time  scale  the  backscattered  signal  is  well  described  by  the  simple 

interferometer model. A linear fit of the minimum backscattering signal time Tn with the recoil phase n

Given  the  time  dependence  of  the  backscattered  signal  derived  above  and  the  precise 

measurement  of  the  period  of  the  oscillation,  we  can  ignore  the  sub-millisecond  scale  recoil 

oscillations and directly retrieve the longer time scale behavior by sampling the peak contrast point for 

each  oscillation.  In  particular,  we  see  from  fig3.a  that  at  2tn  =  2Tn+  8µs  the  backscattering  signal 

reaches  a  peak  in  each  recoil  oscillation  period.  By  sampling  the  backscattering  signal  with 

interrogation  time  2T  around  2tn,  we  were  able  to  study  the  millisecond  scale  behavior  of  the 

backscattering  signal  with  a  small  number  of  sampling  points.  The  millisecond-scale  experiments 

were  done  with  atoms  prepared  in  different  trapping  potentials  B1.    In  addition,  the  standing  wave 

direction  was  tuned  relative  to  propagation  direction  in  the  magnetic  guide  by  adjusting  the  I1 

direction  both  horizontal  and  vertically.  Typical  experimental  results  are  shown  in  fig.  4.  The 

oscillation and  decay of the  backscattering  signal  is  clearly  seen in all  the data.  To  confirm  that  the 

feature is due to the magnetically trapped atoms, we conducted a comparison experiment, where the 

trapped atoms were moved to 1mm below the standing wave region by ramping up the magnetic bias 

field during the escape time. As shown in fig. 5, the resulting amplitude of the backscattering signal is 

below  the  noise  level,  indicating  after  a  escape  time  of  10ms  the  residual  untrapped  atoms  make  a 

negligible contribution to the trapped atom interferometer experiment.   

 

11

More  millisecond  scale  data  with  tesc=10ms  are  included  in  fig.  6,  where  we  characterize  the 

decayed  oscillation  with  2T0  at  the  first  node  of  the  backscattering  signal  amplitude.  We  found  that 

B1T0

2 is approximately a constant as shown in fig. 7 a). Following the method described in part III, the 

standing wave – guiding direction misalignment angle  δ  can be retrieved in each set of millisecond 

scale data through the relation 2T0

≈

. We adjusted the I1 around its optimal value and tried to

minimize the signal decay. By calculating the misaligning angleδfor each data set, the recorded data 

sets can be represented by a point on the (δ, Θ ) plane. Fig. 7b) gives such a plot that includes the 

recorded data with I1 scans approximately horizontal along the I2 – guide plane. Notice the variation of 

the  calculated  misaligning  angle  δ  scales  by  roughly  half  that  of  the  variation  on  the  intersection 

angle 

Θ

, as expected from the relation

∆k

=k

2-k1. However, we have not yet been able to reduce the 

misaligning angle  δ  to less than 5mrad. This is unsurprising – the magnetic guide generated by the 

4-foil  structure  is  of  course  not  perfectly  straight.  The  edge  fields  from  the  ends  of  the  4-foils 

effectively bend the magnetic guide vertically so that the guiding direction varies along a trapped atom 

sample.  The  curvature  of  the  guide  in  this  experiment  has  been  shown  to  be  ~1m-1  in  the  magnetic 

field simulations. Thus the guiding direction should vary up to 5mrad for a 5mm atom sample along 

the guide, which could explain our inability to completely eliminate the effects of misalignment. 

The  influence  of  the  waveguide  curvature  is  not  unavoidable.  We  are  currently  constructing  a 

new experimental apparatus with a longer magnetic structure that generates a much straighter guiding 

potential.  In  addition,  the  influence  of  the  waveguide  curvature  can  be  efficiently  suppressed  by 

preparing the atom sample with much shorter spreading along the guide.

V. Conclusion 

In conclusion, we have studied the time domain de Broglie wave interferometer with atoms in a 

2D  linear  magnetic  trap.  We  observed  millisecond-scale  oscillations  on  the  amplitude  of  the 

backscattering signal that are due to the influence of the residual magnetic field confinement along the 

standing wave direction. In this experiment, the precision of the standing wave alignment relative to 

the  guiding  direction  is  limited  by  a  non-negligible  curvature  of  the  guide  itself  that  introduces 

variation  of  the  guiding  direction  along  the  atom  sample.  This  limitation  can  be  overcome  by 

localizing  the  atom  sample  in  the  guide  and  increasing  the  aspect  ratio  of  the  magnetic  structure  to 

make  the  guide  straighter.  Orders  of  magnitude  improvement  in  the  precision  of  the  standing  wave 

alignment should be possible for a localized atom sample in a straighter guide generated by currents in 

micro-fabricated  wires  on  atom  chips,  rather  than  the  macroscopic  ferromagnetic  foils  used  in  this 

experiment.

Fig.1  the  4-foil  structure,  2D+  MOT  and  the  standing  wave  setup.  (a)  Cross-section  of  the  4-foil 

structure:  a  2D  quadruple  field  is  generated  by  the  four-foil  structure.  A  mirror  MOT  in  2D+ 

configuration is setup on top of the structure. Also included in a) is a calculated field and contour plot 

of the magnetic field distribution. (b). The side-view of the 4-foil structure. On top of the structure the 

position of the atoms and standing wave are indicated. Four absorption images taken at 5ms, 10ms, 

20ms, and 30ms after the MOT light is switched off are shown on the top.

Fig.2 The interferometer setup. I1 and I2 intersect at the atom trap region to form a standing wave. The 

angle

Θ

between  the  two  laser  beams  is  around  90mrad,  and  is  measured  to  1%  precision  for  each 

experiment. By adjusting the direction of I

1, the direction of the standing wave relative to the magnetic 

guiding direction can be adjusted. I1 and I2 are independently controlled via AOMs that are not shown 

here. An inserted graph on the middle-right is a typical fft signal from a standing wave experiment. 

WP:  quarter-wave  plate.  PBS:  polarization-dependent  beamsplitter.  BS:  95%  transmission  beam 

pickoff. LO: local field. HP: high band-pass filter. LP: low band-pass filter.

Fig.  7  (a)  the  linear  relation  between  1/(2T0)2  and  B1  retrieved  from  data  in  fig.  6.  The  10% 

uncertainty  in  the  determination  of  T0  is  reflected  in  the  error  bars  along  the  y-axis.  Relative 

magnitude of B1 at each data point is determined by the current run through the conductors, and have 

error bar smaller than the size of the symbols. (b) The misaligning angle  δ  is calculated from 14 set 

of data taken with 

close to 90mrad, and plotted on the (

Θ

δ, Θ ) plane. Different symbols represent 

different B1 values. The 10% uncertainty in determination of T0 is reflected in the error bars of  δ. 

Intersection angle 

  is measured to 1% precision in each experiment and the errors are smaller than 

Θ

the size of the symbols here.

SUMMARY

24

Scale invariant patterns have been found in different biological systems, in many cases

resembling what physicists have found in other nonbiological systems. Here we describe

26

the foraging patterns of free-ranging spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) in the forest of the

Yucatán Peninsula, México and find that these patterns resemble what physicists know as

28

Lévy walks. First, the length of a trajectory’s constituent steps, or continuous moves in the

same direction, is best described by a power-law distribution in which the frequency of ever

30

larger steps decreases as a negative power function of their length. The rate of this decrease

is very close to that predicted by a previous analytical Lévy walk model to be an optimal

32

strategy to search for scarce resources distributed at random (Viswanathan et al 1999).

Second, the frequency distribution of the duration of stops or waiting times also

34

approximates a power-law function. Finally, the mean square displacement during the

monkeys’ first foraging trip increases more rapidly than would be expected from a random

36

walk with constant step length, but within the range predicted for Lévy walks. In view of

these results, we analyze the different exponents characterizing the trajectories described by

38

females and males, and by monkeys on their own or when part of a subgroup. We discuss

the origin of these patterns and their implications for the foraging ecology of spider

40

monkeys.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding how pattern and variability changes with the scale of analysis is one of the

46

main goals of ecological research (Levin 1992). Ideally, one would like to extrapolate

findings in one scale of analysis to another. This may be achieved by simplifying the

48

problem at one scale, finding an expression that its main features without unnecessary

detail and then using this expression to extrapolate to larger scales. Thus, the diffussion

50

approximation to individual animal movements, where an individual is assumed to move at

random as if it was a Brownian particle, has been successfully applied to predict large-scale

52

features of the population such as its rate of spatial dispersal (Turchin 1998).

54

In some cases, universal scaling relationships which describe the same pattern at different

scales have been found in biological systems (rev. in Gisiger 2001). Fractal geometry,

56

where spatial patterns show statistically similar patterns over several orders of magnitude in

the scale of observation, has been succesful in describing patterns of aggregation of

58

resources (Ritchie and Olff 2000) and even in predicting the different relationships that

should exist between body size and home range in different species (Haskell et al. 2002).

60

Here we describe the movement patterns of individual spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) in

62

the wild and find that they resemble what physicists have long recognized as Lévy walks.

These walks show spatial scale invariance in the length of constituent steps and temporal

64

scale invariance in the duration of intervals between steps. Similar movement patterns have

already been found in the foraging flights of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans;

66

Viswanathan et al. 1996). The same authors developed an analytical model suggesting that

Lévy walks are an optimal strategy for finding randomly distributed, scarce resources

68

(Viswanathan et al. 1999).

70

In a Lévy walk (Schlesinger et al. 1993), the length of each successive step (x) varies

according to a power-law function of the form:

72

N(x) ~ x

- a

where 2 <  a  < 3

3

In other words, a Lévy walk has no intrinsic step length scale and thus steps of seemingly

74

very long length may be observed. When taking the logarithm in both sides of the equation,

the power-law relation appears as a straight line, implying that there is a constant

76

proportion of steps of different lengths.

78

Lévy walks have been studied experimentally in many different fields in physics (Klafter et

al. 1996). For instance, in fluid dynamics, the position of tracer particles is analyzed at

80

regular intervals under different flowing media conditions (Weeks et al. 1995). In these

experiments a particle can remain in the same location for some time before moving again.

82

These waiting (or sticking) times also vary according to a power-law function of the form:

N(t) ~ t

- b

where b ~ 2

84

Because some very long steps may occur, in a Lévy walk the mean-squared displacement

will not be a linear function of the time t as it is in regular random walks (i.e. with constant
step length). Rather, the mean-squared displacement <R2(t)> will vary as:

86

<R2(t)> ~ tc  where 1 < c < 2

88

In other words, the mean-squared displacement of a Lévy walker grows faster in time than

that of a random walker with constant step lengths or one with a normal distribution of step

90

lengths. In theoretical studies of Lévy walks, there is a precise prediction about the

relationship that should exist between the three exponents presented above (Weeks et al.

92

1995):

94

for b < 2, c = 2 + b - a

for b > 2, c = 4 - a

Here we analyze the trajectories described by free-ranging spider monkeys in the rainforest

96

of the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula, in México. We use the trajectories that 20 different

individuals followed from dawn until dusk to analyze the frequency distribution of step

98

lengths, the frequency distribution of the waiting time durations and the mean squared

displacement at different times. We find that during a certain regime, spider monkey

100

foraging trajectories are surprisingly similar to the Lévy walks studied by physicists.

4

102

We then use this finding as a tool to explore the possible variations in trajectories with

regard to the grouping behavior of spider monkeys. This species forms temporary

104

aggregations that vary in size and composition throughout the day, which have been

suggested to occur in response to the variation in food availability (Klein and Klein 1977;

106

Symington 1987, 1988). The trajectories described by lone individuals could then be

different to those described by individuals in a subgroup, as they probably represent

108

different strategies for finding or exploiting known food patches. In addition, male spider

monkeys occupy larger home ranges, and travel farther per day and in larger subgroups

110

than females (Symington 1987; Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco 2002) a difference

that may reflect different space use strategies (Wrangham 2000). Therefore we analyzed the

112

Lévy walk parameters separately in the trajectories of lone and grouped individuals as well

as in those of females and males.

METHODS

116

Study site and animals

114

118

120

Data were collected in in the area of forest surrounding the Punta Laguna lake (2 km x 0.75
km), in the Yucatán Peninsula, México (20o38' N, 87o38' W, 14 m elevation). This region is

characterized by seasonally dry tropical climate, with mean annual temperature of about
25oC and mean annual rainfall around 1500 mm, 70% of which is concentrated between

May and October. The main forest fragment near the lake consists or 60 hectares of

122

medium semi-evergreen forest. This is in turn surrounded by secondary successional forest

about 30-40 years old in an area of 5000 hectares recently declared as a protected area, the

124

Otoch Ma'ax Yetel Koh Sanctuary. Spider monkeys use both of these vegetation types,

although they spend more than 70% of their daily time and every night in the medium

126

forest (Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco 2002). Trails were cut throughout the fragment

of medium forest and through part of the successional forest. In these trails, trees and other

128

landmarks were used to make accurate maps of this area. Visibility conditions were very

good as monkeys used the canopy at heights from 5 to 25 m. More details about the study

130

site can be found in Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco (2002).

5

132

Two study groups, occupying 0.95 and 1.66 km2 of forest, respectively, have been studied

continuously since January, 1997. One group (5 female and 3 male adults as of 1999) was

134

habituated to human presence before the study began and the other (15 female and 6 male

adults as of 1999) was habituated during 1997. All monkeys were identified by facial marks

136

and other unique features. Adults were defined by their size and darker faces, and in the

case of males, for their fully descended testes. All monkeys could be reliably identified by

138

the end of 1997.

Data collection

140

Data reported here were collected between September through December 1999. On 20 days

during that period, a different known adult was chosen as the focal subject and followed by

142

at least two observers from dusk until dawn, taking an instantaneous sample of its location,

activity and subgroup size and composition every 5 minutes. The location was estimated

144

visually by two observers to the nearest 5 m with respect to landmark trees or paths. In all

cases a landmark was closer than 50 m from the position of the monkey.

146

Data analysis

Trajectories were analyzed according to the methods outlined by Turchin (1998). The

148

trajectory of each focal monkey consisted of a sequence of paired coordinates, one pair for

each 5 minute interval where an instantaneous sample had been recorded. A step was

150

defined as an interval in which any or both of the coordinates in two consecutive samples

differed. The length of each step was the linear distance separating the position at two

152

consecutive samples. In some cases, observers lost sight of the focal animal for a number of

sample intervals. Steps were not calculated for those intervals but only for those in which

154

the position was known for two consecutive five-minute samples. The frequency

distribution of step lengths was analyzed using a bin size of 10 m. The log-log plot of this

156

distribution was used to calculate the relationship that produced the best fit using a least-

square method.

158

Wating times were calculated from the number of samples in which the focal animal did

160

not change position. The frequency distribution of waiting times was analyzed using a bin

6

size of one interval (5 minutes). The log-log transform of this distribution was used to

162

calculate the relationship producing the best fit using a least-square method.

164

Squared displacements were calculated by measuring, for each individual separately, the

length of a line joining its location in the first sample of the day and its location at different

166

times thereafter. The mean-squared displacement was obtained by averaging all squared

displacements accross all individuals for a given time of day. From this mean-squared

168

displacement a maximum was obtained around 1030 hours, which then decreased as

monkeys consistently began approaching their starting point, in some cases returning to it at

170

noon and in most cases returning to it at dusk (see Figure 4). The mean-squared

displacement from 0630 to 1030 was then taken to be a period in which most of the

172

individuals moved away from their starting point. For this period only, a log-log plot was

produced and a line adjusted by the least-square method.

174

Turning angles were calculated by substracting the absolute angle (with respect to the east-

176

west axis and in a counterclockwise direction) of each step from the absolute angle of the

previous step. A frequency distribution of turning angles was thus produced, using a bin

178

size of 10 degrees.

180

The regression slopes for the Lévy walk distribution of trajectories of lone vs. grouped

individuals and females vs. males were compared using an F test for regression slopes

182

(Sokal and Rohlf 1994).

RESULTS

184

The observed daily trajectories of spider monkeys are made up of steps of variable length.

Three examples of these trajectories are shown in Figure 1(a-c). One important property of

186

Lévy walks is that they show self-similarity accross different spatial scales. Indeed, when

we close in on a region of one of these trajectories, a qualitatively similar pattern as in the

188

large scale appears (Figure 1d).

Figure 1

190

192

194

196

Figure 2

202

Figure 3

The frequency distribution of step lengths of all trajectories together shows a wide range of
variation (Figure 2a). The data can be fitted better to a power-law function (Figure 2b; r2 =
0.89) than to an exponential one (r2 = 0.79). The value of the exponent in the negative

power-law equation fitted to the data is a = 2.18.

The frequency distribution of waiting times of all trajectories together also shows a wide

198

degree of varation. Before traveling again, spider monkeys may stop for as little as 10

minutes or for as much as 2 hours (Figure 3). The log-log plot of the data is fit well by a
negative power-law function with an exponent b = 1.7  (r2 = 0.86).

200

204

The squared displacement in many of the individuals analyzed shows a common pattern:

monkeys tend to get away from their sleeping site for a few hours in the morning, before

206

coming back to the origin at noon or staying in the vicinity, normally coming back to the

same sleeping site shortly before sunset. Some individuals, especially males, did not return

208

to the same sleeping site at the end of the day. Close inspection of the mean-squared

displacement of all individuals shows a maximum at around 1030 hours (Figure 4a). A log-

210

log plot of the data for the period between 0630 and 1030 only, when all individuals were
getting away from the origin, adjusts to a line with a slope of 1.7 (r2 = 0.87), as would be

212

expected in a Lévy walk (Figure 4b).

214

Figure 4

216

The fact that spider monkeys travel back to their sleeping sites, as well as the fact that they

sometimes use the same routes for going away from and returning to their sleeping site (for

218

example, see Figure 1b), implies that some persistence should exist in the direction of

8

consecutive steps. Figure 5 shows the distribution of turning angles between successive

220

steps. This distribution is far from being uniform, being centered around zero. However, at

a large enough time scale, this persistence is not expected to affect the scaling relations

222

between the mean-squared displacement and time.

224

Figure 5

226

Spider monkeys change subgroup several times during a day, so the trajectory described by

one individual in one complete day includes some steps traveled on its own and others

228

230

when in a subgroup. When analyzing the distribution of lengths for these steps separately,
the value of the exponent is different: as = 1.50 (r2 = 0.80) for solitary individuals and ag =
2.12 (r2 = 0.89) for individuals in groups (Figure 6). An F test comparing the two regression

slopes shows a significant difference (F = 5.72, P < 0.05). Considering the fact that the

232

number of samples in each category are different, monkeys travel a higher proportion of

long trajectories when on their own than when part of a subgroup (Figure 6).

234

DISCUSSION

We also analyzed the distribution of travel lengths separately for females and males. Figure

238

7 shows that both are described by power laws with exponents af = 2.11 for females and am

= 1.47 for males. It is males who travel a higher proportion of long trajectories than

242

We have presented evidence showing that the daily movements of spider monkeys

resemble what physicists know as Lévy walks, i.e. random walks with power-law scaling in

244

the length of their constituent steps. Waiting times, or the duration of intervals without

movement, also show power-law scaling. As expected from theoretical studies of Lévy

246

walks, the mean-squared displacement increases faster in time than in other random walks

such as a Brownian random walk (Schlesinger et al. 1993).

9

In support of this interpretation,  there is an agreement between all three exponents, as

250

would be predicted from theoretical studies of Lévy walks (Weeks et al. 1995):

252

which, substituting the observed values of each exponent, yields the following prediction

for the value of c:

for b < 2,  c = 2 + b - a

for b = 1.7 < 2

c = 2 + 1.7 – 2.18 = 1.52

256

A value that is close to the observed value of 1.7. In other words, there is an agreement

between different properties of the observed trajectories during this time lapse, such that

258

they can accurately be described as Lévy walks.

260

Lévy walks differ in fundamental ways from other types of random walks, such as

Brownian random walks, which have been used in most models of animal foraging

262

(Turchin 1998). As mentioned before, the mean-squared displacement after a time t is

larger for Lévy walks than for other random walks (Weeks et al. 1995). In the period

264

between 0630 and 1030, when spider monkeys normally spend two or three hours foraging

away from their sleeping sites (Ramos-Fernández, personal observations), the mean-

266

squared displacement increases faster than in a Brownian random walk.

268

However, there are certain regularities in the trajectories analyzed here that would not allow

us to label them as “pure” Lévy walks. After 1030 hours spider monkeys tend to stop

270

traveling away from their sleeping sites and on most ocassions return to them before sunset.

Also, the shape of their home range, which circles a lake (e.g. see Figure 1c), implies that

272

sometimes a monkey will use the same route to go in one direction and return in the

opposite direction. The idea that monkeys are actually following a route of some sort is

274

suggested by the fact that two consecutive steps tend to be given in a similar direction, as

shown in the distribution of turning directions, which is centered around zero.

248

254

276

10

Interpretation of these results hinges on the crucial question of the cues that spider monkeys

278

use for finding food sources. Feeding on the fruit from 50 to 150 species of trees (van

Roosmalen and Klein 1987; Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco 2002), each with its own

280

phenological pattern, spider monkeys clearly face the problem of exploiting an extremely

variable resource. Lévy walks could represent a foraging search strategy, in which the

282

movements of spider monkeys are guided by the odour and visual cues they detect from the

existing ripe fruit in fruiting trees. Alternatively, the patterns reported here could be the

284

result of the knowledge based on memory that spider monkeys could have about the

location of fruiting trees.

286

Little is known about what animals in general know about the location of food sources (rev.

288

in Boinski and Garber, 2000). Experimental evidence suggests that wild capuchin monkeys

(Cebus apella) visit the closest food sources more often than would be expected on the

290

basis of “random search” null models (Janson 1998). Also, they appear to use straighter

lines than would be expected if they were only searching with no memory of where they

292

had found food in the past. If spider monkeys have a similar kind of spatial knowledge

about the past location of food, then the patterns that we report here may not represent

294

“random” searches at all, but the result of more directed travel between known food

sources.

296

However, the null models developed by Janson (1998) as an expectation of travel with no

298

spatial knowledge assume either a constant step length and arbitrary changes in direction or

a constant travel direction until finding a food source. In the results we report here, spider

300

monkeys are in fact including some very long steps in their foraging trajectories. If this is a

common pattern in tree-dwelling monkeys, then a more appropriate null model for foarging

302

with no memory should include visits to farther, unknown food sites. This, in Janson’s

(1998) study, would make it more difficult to distinguish between observed and expected

304

visiting frequencies.

306

It is possible that spider monkeys travel in Lévy walks in order to exploit these unknown

sources of food more efficiently. Viswanathan et al. (1999) have shown that a Lévy walker

11

308

visiting a number of randomly distributed foraging sites will visit more new sites and revisit

less previously visited sites than a Brownian random walker traveling the same total

310

distance. This is because the long steps in a Lévy walk quickly take the forager to more

distant sites, making it less likely that it will walk on its own steps again. In this study, the

312

value for the exponent a in the distribution of step lengths is close to the optimum of a = 2

predicted by Viswanathan et al (1999) for foragers searching for randomly and sparsely

314

distributed food sources.

316

Lévy walk foraging patterns could also be the result of the distribution of fruiting trees

themselves. In an extensive study on several species of tropical trees in different sites

318

around the world, Condit et al. (2000) found highly aggregated distribution patterns for

most of the species, showing graphs of density of neighbors as a function of distance that

320

look strikingly similar to those described by power-law functions. Also, Solé and Manrubia

(1995) report self similar distributions of tree gaps (and thereby sites available for

322

establishment of many new individual trees) in a tropical forest in Panamá. It is possible

that at any given time, the fruiting trees where spider monkeys can feed are distributed in a

324

scale-invariant, fractal manner. Thus, the long steps in the Lévy walks could be those given

between patches of a given fruiting tree, while shorter steps would be given while foraging

326

within a patch. Clearly, more information on the spatial distribution of the spider monkeys’

food resources is required to clarify this issue.

328

Because spider monkeys are important seed dispersers for several tree species, in reality

330

there could exist a bidirectional relationship between their foraging patterns and the

distribution of trees. By foraging and dispersing seeds in such a pattern, spider monkeys

332

might favor, in the long run, a self similar distribution of the very same trees on which they

feed. A similar positive feedback between foraging behavior and the distribution of

334

resources was found by Seabloom and Reichman (2001) in a simulation model of gopher –

grass interaction. By restricting their movements to their defended territories, gophers

336

disturbed areas where more grass could grow on the following season, therefore increasing

habitat patchiness, which increased the foraging efficiency of gophers in the long run.

338

Westcott and Graham (2000) report a long-tailed distribution in the distance traveled by a

12

tropical flycatcher (Myonectes oleaginus) continuously after feeding. Based on the times of

340

digestion for the seeds of different species, the authors derive the expected shape of seed

shadows for different species, which also look very similar to power laws.

342

Another consequence of foraging in a Lévy walk pattern is that previously visited food

344

sources may be revisited after long periods of time, favoring the ripening of more fruit

before the next visit. Such “harvesting” of resources was suggested by Janson (2000) to be

346

one of the reasons why animals foraging on scarce patches of food would not necessarily

visit the closest one in the most optimal route. Perhaps the temporal dimension of the Lévy

348

walk patterns reported here is as important as the spatial one.

350

We have found that the Lévy walks of females and males are different. Males have a larger

proportion of long trajectories than females. This is consistent with the fact that male spider

352

monkeys range over wider areas and travel further per day than females (Symington, 1987;

Ramos-Fernández and Ayala-Orozco 2002). While males range over the whole territory of

354

their group, females seem to restrict most of their time to a portion of it (Ramos-Fernández,

personal observation). At the boundaries of their group’s territory, males form coalitions

356

that engage in very aggressive encounters with neighboring males (Symington 1987;

Ramos-Fernández, personal observations). In view of these results, the fact that the Lévy

358

walks of males contain more long steps than those of females is consistent with their

different space use strategies.

360

Finally, we have found a different value of the power-law exponent for the length

362

distribution of steps given by lone monkeys as for those given by monkeys when part of a

subgroup. In particular, monkeys on their own seem to travel a higher proportion of long

364

steps compared to short ones. One of the cited benefits of group foraging has been an

improvement on the likelihood that the group would find food patches which an individual

366

on its own would not find (Krebs and Davies 1993). If spider monkeys do not have

knowldege of the location of food sources, they could still find more fruting trees when

368

traveling in a subgroup than when alone. The same argument applies if spider monkeys

have knowledge about the location of fruiting trees: if they can share information on the

13

370

known location of resources (Boinski and Garber 2000) it would seem logical that a

subgroup would find more fruiting trees than a single individual, therefore decreasing the

372

proportion of long steps.

374

The origin of the grouping pattern of spider monkeys has led to some discussion

(Symington 1990; Wrangham 2000, in chimpanzees and spider monkeys). An intriguing

376

possibility is that, in a hypothetical ancestor with stable grouping patterns, a Lévy walk

foraging pattern increased the chances of separating from the rest of the group when

378

foraging on scarce resources. In a group of n Lévy walkers, the probability that individuals

will remain near the origin (or cross each other’s path if they all start together at the same

380

spot) is greatly reduced compared to a group of n Brownian walkers (Larralde et al 1992).

Favored by the decrease in feeding competition offered by Lévy walks, social behaviors

382

that maintained group membership even in the absence of visual contact would then

develop, leading to the fission-fusion grouping pattern that we see today.

Figure 1 Daily trajectories of spider monkeys. (a) and (b) adult females. (c) adult male,

450

with the section of the trajectory within the lower-left square amplified in (d). Note that

some individuals, like the adult female in (b), returned to sleep close to where they started

452

their daily travel.

Figure 2 Distribution of the number of 5-minute intervals N(x) during which spider

monkeys traveled a distance of x meters. A total of 841 five-minute intervals from 20 adult

individuals are included. The insert (b) shows the log-log plot of the same data. A power-
law relationship fits the data with r2 = 0.89. The estimated value of the exponent is -2.18.

Figure 3 Distribution of waiting times in the trajectories of spider monkeys. The figure

shows the log-log plot of the number of intervals N(t) with duration t. The relationship is fit
by a power-law function with an estimated value of the exponent of -1.7 (r2 = 0.86).

Figure 4 Squared displacement in the trajectories of spider monkeys. (a) the mean squared

464

displacement across all individual trajectories at different times of day. Note that there is a

maximum at 1030 hours. (b) log-log plot of the mean squared displacement observed from

0630 to 1030 hours. The relationship is well fit by a power-law function with an estimated
value for the exponent of 1.7 (r2 = 0.87).

Figure 5 Circular distribution plot of the turning angle between consecutive steps. Shown

470

is the number of times that two consecutive steps in the trajectories differed by the degrees

shown. Note that the distribution peaks around zero.

Figure 6 Distance traveled by spider monkeys when alone and in groups. Shown is a log-

474

log plot of the number N(x) of five-minute intervals in which a lone adult spider monkey

traveled a distance x. For monkeys traveling alone, a total of 156 five-minute intervals are
included. A power-law relationship fits the data with r2 = 0.8. The estimated value of the

476

exponent is -1.50. For monkeys traveling in a group, a total of 685 five-minute intervals are

exponent is -2.12.

Figure 7 Distance traveled by female and male spider monkeys. Shown is a log-log plot of

482

the number N(x) of continuous trajectories traveled by adult spider monkeys without

stopping, for a distance of x meters. For 14 females, a total of 604 five-minute intervals
were analyzed. A power-law relationship fits the data with r2 = 0.9. The estimated value of

the exponent is -2.11. For 7 males, a total of 237 five-minute intervals were analyzed. A
power-law relationship fits the data with r2 = 0.93. The estimated value of the exponent is -

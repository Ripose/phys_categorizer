Summary.  In foreign exchange markets monotonic rate changes can be observed 
in time scale of order of an hour on the days that governmental interventions took 
place.  We  estimate  the  starting  time  of  an  intervention  using  this  characteristic 
behavior of the exchange rates. We find that big amount of interventions can shift 
the  averaged  rate  about  1  yen  per  1  dollar  in  an  hour,  and  the  rate  change 
distribution becomes asymmetric for a few hours.

Introduction 

1. 
 
The central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets in order to stabilize the 
currency  exchange  rates.  The  amount  of  one  transaction  is  typically  several 
million dollars in the yen-dollar market, while the amount of intervention by the 
bank  of  Japan  sometimes  exceeds  10  billion  dollars  in  one  day.  Due  to  such 
extraordinary  big  amount  the  intervention  is  generally  expected  to  show 
remarkable  influence  on  the  market.  For  the  basic  study  of  foreign  exchange 
markets it is important to clarify the influence of interventions quantitatively and 
statistically.  

Among various studies on foreign exchange markets the effects of interventions 
have  been  investigated  by  using  the  daily  data  [1][2].  In  order  to  clarify  the 
response of markets to an intervention in more detail, we investigate average rate 
shifts after the intervention in the time scale of several minutes.  

As the intervention starting times of the Bank of Japan are not announced, we 
first estimate the starting time using characteristics of rate changes on intervention 
days.  By  analyzing  the  yen-dollar  market’s  tick  data  for  10  years  comparing  the 
information  of  intervention  about  amounts  and  dates,  we  find  statistical  laws  of 
rate changes for typical intervention influences.  

 

 

2.  Asymmetrical rate changes on intervention days 
 
In Fig.1 we show yen-dollar fluctuations on 2/11/1994 as a typical example of an 
intervention  day.  It  is  announced  that  the  United  States'  governmental  bank 
intervened in the foreign exchange market from 11:00AM on this day. Right after 
the  start  of  the  intervention  the  exchange  rate  went  up  nearly  monotonically  for 
about  30  minutes.  We  can  find  similar  rate  changes  also  on  other  intervention 
days.  The  monotonic  rate  changes  cause  an  asymmetric  probability  density 
distribution of rate changes on the intervention day.  
   We  investigate  the  skewness  of  rate  changes  on  intervention  days.  Denoting 
yen-dollar  rate  at  a  time  t  by  P(t)  and  its  change  with  time  interval  T  by 
dP t T

the skewness is defined by the following formula:

where σ is the standard deviation of the rate change. We plot the skewness as a 
function  of  time  scale  T  in  Fig.2.  White  diamonds  (◇)  denote  the  averaged 
skewness  on  non-intervention  days.  The  rate  change  distributions  on  the  non-
intervention days are nearly symmetric as known from the value of the skewness 
being around zero [3]. Black diamonds (◆) show the averaged skewness on days 
of “yen-selling intervention”. Within the time scales between 10 and 60 minutes, 
non-zero skewness is clearly observed on the intervention days. Namely, the rate 
change distribution on intervention days is asymmetric in this time scale. 
 

 Intervention starting time estimation

The  number  of  Japanese  interventions  is  much  larger  than  that  of  any  other 
country. For example, in the yen-dollar exchange market from 1991 to 2004, the 
total  number  of  Japanese  interventions  was  342,  while  that  of  the  United  States'

interventions  was  only  10.  In  order  to  analyze  statistical  properties  we  focus  on 
Japanese  interventions.  The  dates  of  Japanese  interventions  are  now  announced 
and  each  amount  is  also  announced,  however,  the  starting  times  are  never 
announced.  Therefore,  we  have  to  develop  a  method  of  estimating  the  starting 
time of Japanese intervention from given rate change data. 

On an intervention day a large rate change can often be found in the time scale 
between 10 to 60 minutes as mentioned. We assume that such a large rate change 
occurs  due  to  the  intervention  and  define  a  characteristic  time  t0  that  gives  the 
starting time of the largest rate change smoothed over time scale of 60 minutes on 
each  intervention  day  as  indicated  in  Fig.1.  In  Table.1  we  show  a  relationship 
between the intervention time and the characteristic time t0 through the period in 
which  the  starting  times  of  the  United States'  interventions  were  announced. We 
find  that  the  actual  intervention  starting  time  is given  t0 + 20  minutes. We  apply 
this  estimation  method  for  the  estimation  of  starting  times  of  Japanese 
interventions.

intervention  dates,  intervention  times,  characteristic  times  t0,  and  the  intervened 
market.  The  characteristic  time  t0  is  defined  during  a  time  when  the  largest  rate 
change for 60 minutes occurred as shown in Fig.1.

5.  Discussion 
 
We introduced an estimation method of intervention times and clarified influences 
of  the  intervention  on  a  foreign  exchange  market.  The  exchange  rate  drifts  for 
about  an  hour  after  the  start  of  an  intervention  time.  After  an  hour  the  rates 
fluctuate randomly with no drift. The shift of the averaged rate is approximated by 
a linear function of the intervention price. For example, typically an intervention 
of size 1 trillion yen can shift 1 yen in the yen-dollar exchange rates.

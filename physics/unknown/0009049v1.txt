This paper theoretically analyzes the hydrodynamic shape stability problem for sonoluminescing bubbles.
We present a semianalytical approach to describe the evolution of shape perturbations in the strongly nonlinear
regime of violent collapse. The proposed approximation estimating the damping rate produced by liquid
viscosity is used to elucidate the inﬂuence of the collapse phase on subsequent evolution of the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability. We demonstrate that time derivatives of shape perturbations grow signiﬁcantly as the bubble
radius vanishes, forming the dominant contribution to destabilization during the ensuing bounce phase. By this
effect the Rayleigh-Taylor instability can be enhanced drastically, yielding a viable explanation of the upper
threshold of driving pressure experimentally observed by Barber et al. @Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 1380 ~1994!#.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the last decade, a signiﬁcant impulse to theoretical and
experimental studies of the bubble collapse problem was
given by the discovery of the single-bubble sonolumines-
cence phenomenon @1–4#. If a gas bubble in water is sub-
jected to a periodic spherical sound wave of ultrasonic fre-
quency, the acoustic energy can be concentrated by over 12
orders of magnitude in very small volume. During the rar-
efaction part of the acoustic cycle the bubble absorbs energy
from the sound wave, and the subsequent compressional por-
tion of the sound ﬁeld causes the collapse; the resulting ex-
citation and heating of the gas inside the bubble may lead to
UV-light emission of picosecond duration. One of the re-
markable features of sonoluminescing bubbles observed by
Putterman and co-workers is high sensitivity of the light
emission to experimental conditions such as forcing pres-
sure, ambient bubble radius, water temperature, and type of
gas mixture @4–8#. Optical measurements reveal different
dynamic regimes of bubble behavior, and stable sonolumi-
nescence is found only in a narrow range of external param-
eters. Particularly puzzling is the dependence on the ampli-
tude of the forcing pressure where an upper threshold effect
was reported @5#. Usually, the emission of light takes place
when the amplitude of the sound wave exceeds the edge of
sonoluminescence; if the sound intensity is increased further,
beyond a threshold, the light is quenched.

In order to describe the nontrivial experimental results,
Brenner et al. introduced the concept that the observed upper
threshold marks the onset of shape instabilities on the bubble
surface @9,10#. On the basis of linear hydrodynamic analysis,
they argued that the strongest destabilization develops when
the bubble radius reaches its minimum. The acceleration of
compressed gas into the surrounding liquid is enormous, mo-
tivating the Rayleigh-Taylor instability that causes exponen-
tial growth of shape perturbations on time scales of less than
1029 s @10#. This theory, supported by theoretical @11–13#

and experimental @14,15# investigations, was nethertheless
criticized by Putterman and co-workers as to its background;
they claimed that under experimental conditions the liquid
viscosity would quench the shape perturbations, so it is nec-
essary to ﬁnd some mechanism other than the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability that results in the quenching of sonolumi-
nescence @7,8# ~different points of view on the problem are
published in Refs. @16,17#!. The posed discrepancies were
recently examined by numerical simulations of the full hy-
drodynamic model considering the viscous nonlocal effects
@18,19#. Although these studies have demonstrated a satisfac-
tory agreement between the exact hydrodynamics and its ap-
proximation @9,10#,
theoretical clariﬁcations still
seem desirable.

further

In the present work, we propose a semianalytical ap-
proach to clarify the shape stability problem for sonolumi-
nescing bubbles. Our goal is formulated as a detailed inves-
tigation of shape perturbations in the region of the violent
collapse preceding the intensive development of
the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability. For this purpose, analytical so-
lution of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation modeling the liquid
viscosity @20# is used to derive the perturbation dynamics as
a single relation ~distortion amplitude vs bubble radius! ap-
propriate for subsequent theoretical analysis. We demon-
strate that time derivatives of the shape perturbations can
grow drastically as the bubble collapses, giving the dominant
contribution to posterior evolution of the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability during the shocklike bounce. This allows us to
elucidate the destabilization mechanism leading to the upper
threshold effect @5#, and also to estimate the inﬂuence of
liquid viscosity on the shape stability. The paper is organized
as follows. In Sec. II, we propose and justify the analytical
approximation of the bubble dynamics for the violent col-
lapse phase. The subject of Sec. III is the derivation of the
perturbation dynamics for collapsing bubbles. In Sec. IV, we
analyze evolution of the shape perturbations during the col-
lapse, and then give a phenomenological description of the
Rayleigh-Taylor
leading to the
quenching of sonoluminescence. Finally, Sec. V formulates a
summary of the results obtained.

II. BUBBLE DYNAMICS

A. The Rayleigh-Plesset equation

Since Lord Rayleigh treated the collapse of an empty cav-
ity in an inviscid liquid @21#, much reﬁnement has been done
in the theory of bubble dynamics @22#. The main step was the
introduction of liquid viscosity, surface tension, and variable
external driving pressure by Plesset @23#. Following this for-
mulation, the motion of the bubble wall R(t) obeys the rela-
tion ~named the Rayleigh-Plesset equation!

ﬁeld P a represents a spatially homogeneous, standing wave:

A key aspect of modeling the Rayleigh-Plesset dynamics
is the speciﬁcation of the internal pressure P g . The problem
consists in the complexity of the thermoﬂuid mechanical
processes such as heat transport at the bubble-liquid interface
and formation of shock waves inside the bubble @24–29#. It
should be mentioned, however, that in an early paper Trilling
@24# concluded that these shock waves would not signiﬁ-
cantly affect the pressure variation at the bubble wall, which
is the primary determinant of the radial motion; as also dem-
onstrated by Prosperetti et al. @25,26#, at moderate pressure
amplitudes the temperature variations of the liquid near the
bubble are negligible. As a consequence, at conditions rel-
evant to sonoluminescing bubbles the gas pressure P g can be
considered to obey the van der Waals process equation, giv-
ing a rather precise resemblance between theoretical curves
R(t) and experimentally obtained data @30#:

Here R 0 is the ambient bubble radius, h is the collective hard
core van der Waals radius, and k is the effective polytropic
exponent varying from 1 ~the isothermal condition! to the
ratio of speciﬁc heats g ~the adiabatic condition!.

In Fig. 1, we present a typical example of the dynamics
R(t) simulated for an air bubble in water; the values of pa-
rameters in Eqs. ~1!–~3! are chosen to satisfy an experimen-
tal regime where sonoluminescence is observed @31#. For one
acoustic period T537.7 ms, one can resolve three distinct
stages of the bubble dynamics. During the ﬁrst part of the
acoustic cycle, 0,t(ms)<17.5, the bubble radius expands
from its ambient value R 054.5 mm, to the maximum R max
547.1 mm. Then the collapse phase, 17.5,t(ms)<21.8,

takes place; at the end of the compression, a sharp peak of
UV light is emitted as the bubble radius approaches the mini-
mum R min50.56 mm. After the collapse, there is the stage
of weak secondary oscillations, 21.8,t(ms)<T; during this
phase, the bubble dissipates the energy accumulated from the
sound ﬁeld by viscous damping, and its radius approaches
the ambient value R 0 by the beginning of the next acoustic
cycle.

Among the three stages of the bubble dynamics, we focus
on the collapse phase responsible for signiﬁcant accumula-
tion of sound energy. In order to discuss this region in detail,
we rewrite Eq. ~1! as

illustrated by the auxilary lines, the collapse region can be
conditionally subdivided into three intervals: ~i! the weak
collapse, ~ii! the violent collapse, and ~iii! the bounce; within
these intervals, the P ext ,Pvel , and P gas pressure terms, re-
spectively, are dominant in Eq. ~4!.

B. The violent collapse phase

Since our goal is the investigation of the bubble shape
stability during the violent collapse phase, we need to for-
mulate an adequate approximation of the dynamics R(t) in
this region. From Fig. 2, the term Pvel gives the dominant
contribution to the bubble wall acceleration so the dynamics
R(t) principally follows from the classic Rayleigh equation

To derive the next approximation, we take into consideration
the viscosity term Pvis , which dominates among the decel-
erating pressures until the shocklike bounce emerges @Fig.

C. The bounce region

As the gas inside the bubble is compressed to the hard
core radius R!R min’h, the violent collapse phase is halted
abruptly, and the shocklike bounce emerges. During this
very short region ~as shown by Fig. 2, it lasts approximately
10210 s) the bubble wall velocity falls from supersonic
speeds down to zero, releasing the energy stored in the com-
pressed gas through emission of sound waves. The corre-

This exact formulation of the viscous problem is too com-
plex for detailed analysis, although some cases of the full
numerical integration of Eqs. ~18!–~20! were recently re-
ported @18,19#. In order to make the model local and more
appropriate for analytical investigation, we apply several rea-
sonable simpliﬁcations as follows. ~i! The surface tension
can be excluded since s!2mR˙
for collapsing bubbles in
water ~this inequality, equivalent to P sur!Pvis , is illustrated
by Fig. 2 in the previous section!. ~ii! The integral in Eq. ~18!
does not contain viscous terms and, therefore, only results in
tiny increments to coefﬁcients a˙ n and a n ,
in comparison
with 3R˙ /R and 2R¨ /R, respectively. ~iii! As an issue of sim-
pliﬁcation, one needs to approximate the viscous damping
rate caused by the vorticity ﬁeld. For
this purpose, a
boundary-layer type model was proposed by Prosperetti @40#
and examined by Brener and co-workers @9,10#. According
to this approach, considerable vorticity is localized within a
small boundary layer of thickness daround the bubble; then
the integral in Eq. ~20! is written as 2dT(R,t)/R, so the
vorticity at the bubble wall follows from the expression

Let us consider an initially spherical bubble immersed in
an inﬁnite viscous liquid. In order to study the problem of
shape stability, we assume a ﬂuctuation ﬁeld that perturbs
the bubble-liquid interface @32#. This ﬁeld of perturbations is
represented by spherical Legendre polynomials as

Here R(t) and Rˆ (t,u,w) are the undistorted and distorted
bubble radii, respectively (u and w are parameters of the
spherical coordinate system whose origin is at the center of
the bubble!; functions Y n(u,w) are the spherical harmonics
of degree n5(2, . . . ,‘); the distortion amplitudes a n(t) are
considered to be small, ua n(t)u!R(t). The classic example
of a surface instability is the growth of perturbations on a
plane interface separating a light liquid from a heavier one
into which it is being uniformly accelerated; this is generally
known as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability @33#.

The instabilities that arise on the surface of an acousti-
cally driven bubble are accompanied by effects related to the
spherical geometry @34–38#. For the simplest case of inviscid
liquids, the perturbation dynamics was derived by Plesset

The inﬂuence of liquid viscosity, being neglected in Plesset’s
derivation, was taken into account by Prosperetti @39#. The
intrinsic difﬁculty of
this consideration is that viscous
stresses produce vorticity of the liquid in neighborhood of
the bubble wall; this vorticity spreads by both convective and
diffusive processes and the problem becomes strongly non-
local:

2162

VLADISLAV A. BOGOYAVLENSKIY

Although the boundary-layer approximation is based on
rather questionable assumptions ~a relevant discussion is
published in Refs. @16,17#!, its application leads to satisfac-
tory estimations of the viscous damping ~see @18,19# and
Appendix B!. In this work, we consider the limiting case of
a thin layer related to maximal viscous dissipation, implying
the vorticity ﬁeld as given in Eq. ~21! with d!0.

By our three considerations ~i!–~iii!, the system of Eqs.

A. Stability analysis of the violent collapse

1. Theoretical investigation

In the previous section, we have derived Eq. ~30!, which
governs the perturbation dynamics in the violent collapse
region. Before we proceed to numerical simulations of this
differential relation, some of its asymptotic properties can be
pointed out theoretically.

~i! Let us take the inviscid limit aR˜ 21/2@1; in this case,

where j1 and j2 are deﬁned by Eq. ~37!, and the parameters

~39!

However, the absolute values of the negative root j2 are
small for low modes n ~e.g., uj2u rises from 0 to 0.2 as n
varies from 2 to 6!, so the growth of perturbations by Eq.
~39! is rather weak, as in the inviscid limit @Eq. ~34!#.

2. Numerical simulations

To give the overall picture for the perturbation dynamics
a n(R˜ ), results of the numerical simulations of Eq. ~30! are
presented in the range 0.01<R˜ <1 ~in logarithmic scale of
the dimensionless bubble radius R˜ ) covering all the compres-
sion stages of sonoluminescing bubbles.

In Fig. 3, we illustrate the evolution of the quadrupole
mode a 2 for various values of the viscosity parameter a; the
0 and
initial conditions for the simulation are chosen as a 25a 2

da 2 /dR˜ 50 at R˜ 51. The calculated curves a 2(log10R˜ ) dem-
onstrate a nonlinear oscillating behavior, where the succes-
sive increase of liquid viscosity ~decrease of a) results in a
monotonic damping of the distortion amplitude. However,
this viscous damping yields a substantial contribution to the
perturbation dynamics only if a,10; this inequality is not
valid for sonoluminescing bubbles ~where a;100 due to
@41#!, so the inﬂuence of viscosity on the shape stability can
be considered as negligible in the violent collapse region.

The perturbation dynamics a n(log10R˜ )

for different
modes n52, . . . ,6 and ﬁxed viscosity parameter a5100 is
summarized by Fig. 4; the initial conditions at R˜ 51 are the
same as in Fig. 3. As one can see by comparing Figs. 3 and
4, the high harmonics n>3 qualitatively resemble the dy-

B. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability

The stability analysis of the violent collapse region pre-
sented above has shown that the growth of the perturbation
amplitude is rather weak @Eq. ~34!#, resulting in an insigniﬁ-
cant contribution to the shape destabilization. This raises the
following problem: does it mean that the inﬂuence of the
collapse phase on subsequent development of the Rayleigh-
Taylor instability is inﬁnitesimal? In order to answer the
question posed, let us study the transition from the violent
collapse to the bounce in detail. When the bounce phase
emerges ~see Sec. II C and Fig. 2!, the bubble dynamics
transforms abruptly from collapsing @Eq. ~10!# to shock-

C. Coexistence of different instability mechanisms

Although the main reason for the shape destabilization of
sonoluminescing bubbles consists in the strongest develop-
ment of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the instant of col-
lapse, some additional mechanisms also coexist, such as the
parametric and afterbounce instabilities distinguished by
Brenner and co-workers @9,10#. The ﬁrst arises due to the
accumulation of perturbations from sphericity over many os-
cillation periods, similar to Faraday waves. The second
grows during the rapid afterbounces @secondary weak oscil-
lations ~Fig. 1!# that bubbles execute after the point of mini-
mal radius. The increments of the destabilization mecha-
nisms to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability lead to a very
complex structure for the stability boundary @8–10,17–19#.
Since a detailed quantitative analysis of these increments in
terms of our semianalytical approach seems rather difﬁcult,
we propose a phenomenological description as follows.

From our studies,

the dominant contribution to the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability comes from the time derivatives
of the surface distortion a˙
n* at the end of the violent collapse
phase. As shown in Fig. 5, the derivative terms a˙ n(R˜ ) oscil-
late extremely nonlinear as the bubble radius R˜ diminishes.

V. SUMMARY

~i! We have shown that

the general Rayleigh-Plesset
equation governing the dynamics of
sonoluminescing
bubbles allows an analytically integrable approximation
~which takes into account the liquid viscosity term! in the
violent collapse region.

~ii! Based on the boundary-layer approach, we have de-
rived a single differential relation ~distortion amplitude vs
bubble radius! for the perturbation dynamics during the vio-
lent collapse. Theoretical and numerical investigations reveal
strongly nonlinear oscillations of the distortion amplitudes
~weakly dependent on the liquid viscosity! as the bubble ra-
dius vanishes.

~iii! We have estimated the contribution of the violent
collapse phase to the posterior intensive development of the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and then have elucidated the up-
per threshold effect, discussing the increments from paramet-

APPENDIX A: DYNAMICS OF VISCOUS COLLAPSE

The proposed simpliﬁcation of the general Rayleigh-
Plesset dynamics @Eqs. ~8! and ~9!# may need additional jus-
tiﬁcation, since the external pressure P ext exceeds ~or is
comparable with! the viscous term Pvis during the violent
collapse region ~Fig. 2!. Despite the fact that it seems desir-
able to include P ext in the approximation proposed @Eq. ~8!#,
we have nevertheless ignored the external pressure term in
our consideration for the following reasons.

~i! The function P ext(R) is approximately constant during
the whole collapse so its increment to the bubble dynamics
R(t) can be compensated by an insigniﬁcant increase of the
initial velocity V i in Eq. ~9!, in contrast to the strongly non-
linear behavior of the viscous contribution Pvis as the bubble
approaches the minimum.

~ii! The viscous pressure Pvis

is the only term in the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation responsible for the dissipation of
sound energy until the bounce emerges and, therefore, its
consideration is preferable to that of P ext .

~iii! The approximation introduced allows us to obtain an
analytical solution of the bubble dynamics @Eq. ~10!#; that
yields the opportunity for subsequent detailed analysis of the
shape stability problem.

APPENDIX B: BOUNDARY-LAYER APPROXIMATION

The boundary-layer approximation was criticized by
Putterman and Roberts @16# since, as they claimed, it under-
estimates the viscous damping rate produced by the vorticity
ﬁeld. They argued that the thickness dof the boundary layer
can drastically exceed the value estimated by Eq. ~22!, espe-
cially when the bubble reaches its minimum, yielding en-
hanced dissipation within the layer. Further investigations of
the problem @18,19# stimulated by this criticism have re-
vealed that the actual thickness d is several times greater
than the assumed one, but the discrepancies between the ex-
act model and its dapproximation are nevertheless insigniﬁ-
cant. The solution of the seeming paradox follows from
simple analysis of Eq. ~21!: increase of the parameter dre-
sults in a monotonic decrease of T(R,t), i.e., the viscous
dissipation caused by the liquid vorticity decreases as the
boundary layer is enhanced. In other words, consideration of
the vorticity localized cannot underestimate, but rather over-
estimates, the inﬂuence of liquid viscosity. The reported con-
ditions related to slight underestimation of the viscous damp-
ing rate @18,19# are easily explained as follows. The criterion
by which one can determine if the dmodel overestimates ~or
underestimates! the viscosity effect states that the sign of
T(R,t)
the sign of
‘T(r,t)/r ndr. The function T(r,t) usually demonstrates

R

is the same as ~or opposite to!

2166

the oscillating behavior of r with diminishing amplitude @18#,
so in most cases the signs are the same and, therefore, the
boundary-layer type approximation is adequate. Some rare
cases when the equality of the signs is broken, relevant to the
observed discrepancies between the models, correspond to
the afterbounce phase of the bubble dynamics @18#. Since in
this paper we are focused on the collapse and on the bounce,
the application of the dmodel to our stability analysis seems
rather reasonable.

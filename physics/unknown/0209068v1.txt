a Quad-cavity, with its quadrupole mode at beam

nearby beam-position-monitors. This paper describes the

1 INTRODUCTION
RMS beam emittance is a key beam parameter, along
accelerator operations[1].
with beam position,
Currently single-pulse emittance measurement
is not
available, and thus beam tune-up time takes from hours to
days. A pulse-to-pulse size measurement based on
striplines has been proposed previously, by Miller, et
al.[2]. We have extended the idea of a resonant cavity[3]
as
beam emittance
measurement. Advantages over a stripline configuration
(1) stronger beam and desired cavity mode
include:
coupling, i.e., larger [R/Q]; and (2) high signal-to-noise
ratio by resonance of a cavity mode at
the bunch
frequency.
The

emittance
measurement
is to employ a resonant cavity monitor
operated in the quadrupole mode. This provides a voltage
phasor output proportional to the product of charge and

phased with the beam. A series of such monitors placed in
a FODO lattice, and separated by adequate machine phase
advance, permits one to deconvolve beam matching
parameters, and rms emittance.

The Quad-cavity is designed, by symmetry, to have a
quadrupole mode that
is exclusively excited by the
beam’s quadrupole moment, and thus, for a flat beam, is
indicative of its size. In order for maximum coupling
between the beam quadrupole moment
and
the cavity quad-mode, the cavity must be rotated by 45
degrees along the linac axis as in Figure 1.

Parasitic common modes,

i.e. modes other than the
quad-modes, are minimized by: (1) separating the other
resonance mode away from the quad-mode by at least 1
GHz; (2) maximizing the beam and quad-mode coupling
by optimizing the cavity length along the beam pipe; (3)
utilizing symmetry in simple network to cancel out
parasitic modes, and (4) using for this network waveguide
in which the lower modes are cutoff. The electric field can
be reduced by many orders of magnitude at a frequency
about 1 GHz away from the mode frequency. Further, the
quad mode is the lowest mode of odd-odd symmetry with
respect
in the cavity
coordinates. Thus,
the monopole and dipoles can be
superimposed away via proper hybrid T connections, as
shown in Figure 1.

3 QUAD-CAVITY DESIGN

or

for

beam size monitoring

Based on the basic resonance concept described in
previous sections, we present a specific design of a Quad-
cavity
emittance
measurement applicable for X-band accelerators operating
at 11.424 GHz. First, we choose some design parameters
specific to accelerators. The diameter of the beam pipe
attached to the Quad-system is chosen as 1cm,
large
enough for an X-Band linac (with typical iris diameter of
8 mm). Considering resonance enhancement effect and
tight tolerance requirement in fabrication, with increasing
Q, we choose the external Q value around 750, whose
FWHM of the resonance mode energy is 15 MHz. With
these chosen parameters, we arrived at an optimized quad-
cavity design, shown in Figure 4, that could permit a
detection of an rms-beam size under 100 microns, after
detailed numerical
simulations using electromagnetic
field-solvers [4][5]. The main design parameters are
summarized in Table 1.

Figure 4. Quad-cavity and two hybrid tee geometry, with
shortened waveguides, in mesh from the GdfidL code [4].

The pillbox resonance frequencies of the cavity in Table 1
are 5.8GHz (monopole), 9.1 and 9.3 GHz (dipoles), 11.6
GHz (quad) and 12.84 GHz (next higher mode). The

4 DESIGN ANALYSIS
Linear accelerators typically have a train of bunches in
a pulse. The response of a pulse can be obtained by
superposing the port signals of a single bunch at delayed
times, each delayed by the bunch intervals. Numerical
simulations are performed for a single Gaussian bunch
with
=4mm. Since the GdfidL code used allows
transversely only a pencil beam, we offset the beam to
x=y=0.5mm,
in the cavity coordinates, exciting the
quadrupole mode, as well as monopole and dipole modes.
Figure 5 shows the results of various output voltages:
output voltage from port 1 (V1) of one bunch (top); V1-
V2 of one bunch (next); V1-V2 for 80 nsec pulse (next);
and V1+V2 for 80 nsec pulse (bottom). The multi-bunch
responses are obtained by superposing the single bunch
response at delayed times 1/ f0=11.424 GHz. The slope of
V1-V2 envelope, on a logarithmic scale, gives the
external Q of the quad-mode.

quadrupole moment effect, while that of V1+V2 increases
with the offset, a dipole moment effect. The third T
junction, not modeled, eliminates this dipole signal,
passing only the quadrupole signal.

Phase errors in the iris dimensions or locations can be
significant. One mil error in one of the iris locations and
sizes can modify the resonance frequency by over 10
MHz. On the other hand, phase errors due to inaccuracies
in the waveguide lengths allow relatively loose tolerances.
The tolerance for our cavity dimensions is 1 mil for an
external Q of 750. The variation of
temperature
corresponding to 1 mil in the length variation of our Cu-
cavity is 40 degree Kelvin.

5 DISCUSSION
The rf and mechanical design of

the cavity and
waveguide network are complete, and a prototype shown
in Figure 6 is being fabricated. A tuning device is
implemented in the prototype, for fabrication purpose
only, to relax tolerance. A device that can pull-and-push,
symmetrically, the beampipe attached to the cavity allows
the volume of the cavity to be adjusted, thus adjusting the
resonance frequency.

At resonance,

the quadrupole mode signal (V1-V2)
increases monotonically with bunches while the dipole
component,
reaches a steady value within
several bunches, at low values, as seen in Figure 5. The
quad-signals show some modulation and saturate at a
reduced amplitude when the bunch frequency is
mismatched with the cavity resonant frequency as an
extension of Figure 2 would predict.

Numerical investigations of various offsets indicate that
the level of V1-V2 increases with the offset squared, a

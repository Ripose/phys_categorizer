Random Walk and Balancing1

Frank Borg. Chydenius Institute, Jyväskylä University, 67101 Kokkola-Karleby, Finland2.

Problem statement: What is the role, nature and cause of the apparent randomness exhibited by the
neuromuscular/sensimotor system and observed especially in quiet standing and stick balancing?

Physical Review Letters  1994 contained an intriguing paper titled "Random walking during quiet
standing" (Collins  and  De Luca 1994). It dealt with the interesting phenomenon, that when you
stand   “still”   (quiet   standing)   your   body   sways   back   and   forth.   Without   external   support   it   is
impossible to stand like a rigid pillar. The most simple non-trivial physical model one can make of
the situation is the inverted pendulum. The ankle joints are the pivot points and the muscles act like
a spring keeping the pendulum upright. David A Winter  et alii  (1998, 2001, 20003) have shown
how surprisingly well such a model accounts for some basic features of the quiet standing, if one
excepts the “random walk” aspects of the stance3. In the present review we describe a few models of
stance   and   balancing   with   special   emphasis   on   trying   to  understand  the   role   of   the   random
behaviour.   Studies   of   chaos   in   recent   decades   have  teased  us   to  look  at   “noise”  as   something
probably   more   than   just   a   “disturbance”   (which   one   had   hoped   to   be   able   to   neglect   while
preserving the essential elements of the system). This shift of perspective has also accelerated due to
insights   from   theories   and   experiments   around   stochastic   resonance   (SR)   and   self-organized
criticality (SOC). 

An electronic stabilometer consists of a rectangular (there are also  triangular  versions) plate with
force   transducers   in   the   corners   which   measures   the   vertical   forces.   Using   these   data   we   can
compute the center of pressure (COP) – see fig 1 which shows a top view of force plate – according
to

where Fi is the force measured by transducer #i. According to the conventions the person is standing
such that the y-axis will be the forward direction (anterior/posterior = A/P) while the x-axis is along
the sideway direction (medial/lateral = M/L). Nowadays the force plates are of course interfaced
with computers. The measurements procedures are simple but require standardized test conditions
in order to ensure repeatability. In our static tests we have adopted the “Morton”-foot position with
feet positioned with a 30 degree angle between medial sides and a 2 cm heel-to-heel separation. The

3 The passive stiffness control model proposed by Winter et alii has however been criticized by a number of

investigators. These aspects will be dealt with in a subsequent paper which draws e.g. on EMG-measurements which
demonstrate how the gastrocnemius muscles modulate the balancing.

arms are relaxed on the sides and the gaze  fixed  on a point 3 m away at 1.5 m height. Typical
measurement time used is 60 seconds. Disturbing sounds, movements and lights must naturally be
avoided. For standardization issues see Kapteyn et al. (1983), Browne & O'Hare (2000), Carpenter
et al. (2001) and Mcllroy & Maki (1997).

The force values are transformed to COP-coordinates which produces two time series, x(t) and y(t),
so called  stabilograms.  If  we  draw  the  curve     (x(t),  y(t))  in  the  plane  we obtain  the  so  called
statokinesigram  (or  posturogram) which shows how the COP shifts with time (fig. 2). A central
question that has been addressed during the last decades is how to extract information from these
time series that might have diagnostic relevance. A related question is naturally whether the data can
be successfully interpreted in terms of a mathematically formulated neuro-muscular model.

These  questions  hint   at  two  main  types  of  approaches:  on  the  one  hand  we  have  the  classical
Newtonian   methods   –   physical   modelling   –   which   is   based   on   the   physically   motivated
mathematical   models   of   the   phenomena;   on   the   other   hand   we   have   the   so   called   algorithmic
modelling (Rapp et al. 1999, Jones 2001). In the algorithmic modelling approach one does not try to
model the mechanism in itself which is instead considered as a black or gray box; it is the data (the
time series) which is the main object whose characteristics is to be explained using a mathematical
modelling. System identification is a discipline that can be said to have much in common with
algorithmic modelling. An interesting link between these two main approaches is provided by recent
works on non-linear time series analysis which originated with the study of non-linear dynamics and
chaotic systems (Abarbanel 1995, Kantz  and Schreiber 2000). These studies have  revealed  that
under quite general circumstances it is possible to extract a number of characteristic invariants of
the dynamical systems without a detailed knowledge of the system, and only using the data of the
time series generated by the system. One example of such an invariant is the topological dimension
of the system or its “attractor”. Another point is that these non-linear methods are not sensitive to
how the data is represented because one is looking for invariants. Thus, global  Ljapunov-exponents
are independent of the coordinate system used. Other interesting parameters introduced via non-
linear   time   series   analysis   are   the   various   entropies   (Kolomogorov-Sinai,   Renyi,   Approximate
Entropy),   correlation   dimension,   mutual   information,   etc.   Another   observation   is   that   for
complicated system (such as living organisms) it happens that a large number of the degrees of
freedom get “frozen” and that the system in certain aspects thus behaves as a low-dimensional
dynamical system. Hermann Haken and his associates have discussed a number of instances of such
a “freezing” of the degrees of freedom  (Haken 1983), a phenomenon that gives reason to think that
non-linear time series analysis may find uses in biomedical signal analysis4.

A quite common idea in chaos research is that “healthy” organic systems may have a number of
chaotic properties; indeed, a chaotic dynamics implies that the system probes an extended set of
points in the phase space and thus is ready to react to new unexpected  circumstances, while a too
regular   system   remains   locked   up   in   small   part   of   the   phase   space.   There   are   experimental
indications of a higher correlation between A/P- and M/L-swaying for MS and Parkinson patients
than for normal participants (Rosenblum et al. 1998). One may assume that a more rigid coupling
between the A/P- and M/L-swayings is associated with a reduced ability to correct posture when
subjected to perturbations.

4 In quiet standing we have an obvious example of the “freezing of degrees of freedom” in the sense that by the  co-

activation of a number of postural muscles the standing person can to a good approximation be modelled as a human
inverted pendulum.

The   system   of   postural   control   involves   the   vestibular   system   which   registers   the   linear
accelerations and rotations of the head; skin receptors; the eyes; joint receptors; muscle spindles
which register length and the rate of contraction of the muscle; Golgi-organs at the muscle tendons
which   gauge   the   tension.   The   feet   are   especially  well   endowed   with   ligaments   and   receptors.
Standing on a soft compliant material affects the swayings significantly. Signals from the receptors
in the muscles and ligaments are routed via synapses in the spine to motor neurons which control
the   muscles,   thus   creating   a   feedback   system.   The   typical   response   time   for   leg   muscles
(gastrocnemius,   soleus,   peroneus   longus,   etc)   is   about   90   –   140   ms.   The   postural   feedback
mechanism can e.g. be tested by stimulating neck muscles which will prompt automatic postural
reflexes.

The  clinical  study   of   stance   is   called   posturology  (Gagey  and   Weber   1999).   Quite   a   number
parameters have been used over the years in order to describe the posturograms. Chiari et al. (2002,
2000) list 55 parameters, many of which of course are overlapping. These authors conveniently
classify the parameters into three groups:

•

•

•

time-based parameters

frequency-based parameters

stochastic parameters

Baratto  et alii  (2002) present another classification dividing the parameters into two categories:
global parameters and structural parameters.  The global parameters are described as those “which
estimate the overall 'size' of the sway patterns”, whereas structural parameters are those “which
attempt to decompose the sway patterns into elements and then examine their interactions”. Trace-
length and diffusion analysis parameters (discussed below) are given as examples of the respective
categories. One of the conclusions of the study by Baratto et  alii, after investigating a set of 39
parameters, is that the set can be basically reduced to two global and two structural parameters that
are particularly useful in the clinical practice (more below).

The group of time-based parameters includes descriptive parameters such as the area covered by the
COP-points   (can   be   defined   in   various   ways);   the   length   of   the   COP-trace   (depends   of   the
resolution);   average   velocity   in   the   A/P-   and   the   M/L-direction.   The   power-spectrum   of   the
stabilograms (range typically 0 – 10 Hz) yield frequency-based parameters  such as the average
frequency. The investigations Collins and De Luca (1993, 1994) brought the stochastic parameters
into   the   picture.   Within   the   field   of   posturology   the  stochastic  study   is   often   referred   to   as
"stabilographic diffusion analys" (SDA) as there seems to be an analogue with the diffusion as a
stochastic process. Collins and De Luca made an attempt to interpret the “spaghetti curve” of the
posturogram as a result of deterministic chaos: 

"A likely candidate for physiological chaos is the human postural control system, the output of
which is highly irregular .... The identification of postural sway as an instance of chaos would
suggest that there is a simple, dynamical mechanism at work in balance regulation and may make
possible new therapeutic and preventative strategies for postural instability" (Collins  and De Luca
1994: 764). 

In order to test the hypothesis  of  deterministic  chaos  as an explanation  of  the random looking
aspects of the swaying, the authors estimated the Ljapunov exponents for both the original data and

BAL_ENG.SXW

a phase randomized substitute data (which has the same statistical properties as the  original  data
while all the deterministic correlations are wiped out) and they got the same results, concluding that:
"(...) the postural control system should not be modeled as a chaotic process and that it is better
represented as a stochastic one" (ibidem p. 765). It might be cautioned that the usual estimations of
the Ljapunov exponents are quite sensitive to noise, and a noise level of 2 – 3% may be enough to
render an estimation inconclusive (Kantz and Schreiber 2000).

The favourite stochastic models that have been used in this connection are the  fractal  Brownian
motion  (fBm) and the  fractal Gaussian noise  (fGn). Mandelbrot and Wallis (1968) coined these
terms   but   the   models   were   studied   already   around   1940   by   A   N   Kolmogorov.   A   basic   idea
underpinning these models is that of a  self similar  process; or, more exactly,  an  H-self similar
process   x(t),   which   is   defined   by  the   requirement   that   the   scaled   version  x(at)   is   statistically
equivalent with the process x(t) multiplied by a factor aH (H is the so called Hurst-exponent),

(1)

which is commonly symbolized by

(2)

d 1 

x t  =

a H⋅x at 

In order to characterize the fBm-process x(t) we assume that x(0) = 0 (with probability 1), then the
variance of the fBm satisfies

(3)

〈 x t− x t 2 〉= 2 ∣∣2 H

For H = 0.5 we obtain the ordinary Brownian motion where the variance is a linear function of time
D. The cases H  0.5 are referred to as anomalous diffusion (see e.g. Metzler and Klafter (2000)). It
can be argued mathematically (Flandrin 1989) that the average power spectrum for fBm will be

that is, the power spectrum depends on the frequency as f raised to -2H – 1. Thus, the bigger the H-
value the smoother we expect the curve x(t) to be, since the high frequency components are more
damped for bigger H. In fact, the graph of a H-self similar curve defines a set in the plane with the
fractal dimension D = 2 – H.

In order to check whether the data is compatible with an fBm-process there are two obvious avenues

suggested by (3) and (4): First, the method of variance based on equ (3) where we calculate the the
variance for a series of time  differences  D  and try to fit the result to a power law; secondly, the
method of power spectrum where we make an FFT-analysis of the data and try to fit the estimated
power spectrum to a 1/f-spectrum (4). Collins and De Luca (1994) for instance employ the variance
method whereas Thurner  et alii  (2002) also use the power spectrum method in order to analyze
posturogram data. Both methods give similar results. The time as well as the frequency range tend
to be divided into two regimes characterized by persistence (t < 1 s, f > 1 Hz) and  anti-persistence
(t > 1 s, f < 1 Hz). Persistence means that the movement tends to continue in the same direction as
before, whereas anti-persistence means that the movement is likely to reverse. Collins and De Luca
(1994) obtained for the short-time Hurst-exponent   Hs = 0.83  0.04, and for the long-time Hurst-
exponent  Hl = 0.25  0.06. For time long enough the Hurst exponent should approach 0 according
to (3) since the motion (swaying) is bounded.

The physical reason for these two regimes is quite clear. In the short-time perspective the body is
likely to continue to move in the same direction as the moment before due to its inertia. However,
when the body deviates by more than 0.5 degrees from the “equilibrium position” we expect a
correction to take place which will temporarily return the body to the upright equilibrium position5.
This process suggests a mechanical model (Peterka 2000) in the form of an inverted pendulum, with
a spring that returns it to the vertical position, and a stochastic “disturbance” that explains the erratic
swaying.

Here a stands for the angular deviation from the vertical in the A/P-direction (sagittal plane), I is the
moment of inertia with respect to the ankle joint (pivot point), KP is the spring constant ("stiffness"),
m  is the mass of the pendulum (body mass minus mass of the feet), and  L  is finally the distance
from the ankle joint to the center of mass (COM). On the right hand side of (5) we have a Gaussian
noise factor  n(t) with the variance 1 and mean 0, whereas the exponential factor represents a low
pass filter. The model also incorporates a friction term and an “integrator” in accordance with the
classical PID-control models for plants (Khoo 2000).

For the model (5) we can calculate the spectrum for the COM-coordinate yc , which is proportional
to the angle a ( yc = La for small angles a), and for realistic parameter values we indeed obtain two
distinct regions around the “threshold” frequency (using parameter values from Peterka 2000)

The previous modell used “white noise” (H = 0.5) for the disturbances, and the H-self similarity is
shown to be only approximately valid within some restricted ranges of time and frequency. Chow
and Collins (1995) who studied the balance using a pinned polymer model driven by stochastic
noise  realized  that   the  fluctuation-dissipation   theorem  (FDT)   of   statistical   physics   would   be
applicable in such a model. With the FDT it is possible to predict the characteristic  responses  to
small  perturbations   using  only  perturbation-free  data  (its   auto-correlation   function).  This   seems
indeed to have been verified experimentally for quiet standing (Lauk et al. 1998; Hsiao-Wecksler et
al. 2003). One implication is that it might be possible to predict the response of persons to small
perturbations without actually subjecting them to physical perturbations.

Apparently (5) describes a continuous version  of the ARMA-models (“Auto-Regressive-Moving
Average”) which are quite popular in the biomedical field (Bruce 2001; Rangayyang 2002). If we
assume that the coordinate  xi at time ti is a linear function of past values plus a stochastic term we
get the equation

Neglecting the stochastic term this model goes under the name of linear prediction (LP) (see e.g.
Press et al. 2002 §13.6). The figure 5 shows a curve of simulated data (upper curve) according to (6)
as compared with real data (bottom curve). In the simulation we have used the values n = 10, m =
40, and the filter parameters a have been calculated from the measurement data using an adaptive
LMS-algorithm (the classical adaptive Widrow-Hoff algorithm is discussed e.g. by Haykin 1999
and   Hänsler   1997).   The   stochastic   terms  w  were   finally   generated   according   to   a   Gaussian
distribution with the standard deviation 1 and mean 0, while the MA-parameters were set to  b0 = ....
= b39 = 0.038. Equ (5) and (6) may illustrate a typical difference between a physical model and an
algorithmic   model.   Physical   models   have   the   obvious   advantage   of   connecting   the   model
parameters with physical characteristics that in principle can be measured and compared with the
model. The ARMA-model on the other hand may be easy to fit to the experimental data. From a
diagnostic point of view it may be enough to obtain parameter sets that are able to categorize the
data into “normal” and “pathologic”. This is also a typical objective for Artificial Neural Networks
(ANN) which belong to a group of analysis methods termed "soft computing" (Tettamanzi  and
Tomassini 2001). Algorithmic modelling may be justified when there is no obvious physical model
at hand or it is too complicated to be the basis for practical calculations.

Rosenblum  et alii  (1998) present a completely deterministic model of the swaying. The starting
point is again the inverted pendulum, in this case supplied with a non-linear feed back control

In general 1- and 2-dimensional autonomous continuous dynamical system do not generate chaos
(result   of  the   Poincaré-Bendixon-theorem;  see  e.g.  Alligood  et   alii  (1996)).  However,   with   the
delayed feedback control the situation might change; a classical example is the “Ikeda-oscillator”
(Ikeda and Matsumoto 1987)

which generates a chaotic signal (e.g. for  a  = 1,    = 20,    = 2). Another classical illustration of
chaos, via period doubling, is given by the logistic map

is in fact related to (9) (if we ignore the velocity term in (9)) and gives a hint why chaos may be
expected for dynamical systems with time delayed feedback.

Milton (2000) presents some interesting ideas on the role of stochastic signals in biology though e.g.
the model in (Eurich and Milton 1996) for balance may be somewhat too schematic for throwing
much light on the phenomenon. It is also suggested that the phenomenon of stochastic resonance
(SR, see e.g. Moss 2000) may play a significant role in many biological processes. A recent study
(Kitajo et al. 2003) indicates that subliminal visual stimuli may improve the sensimotor sensitivity.
Soma  et   al.  (2003)   have   presented   experimental   results   according   to   which   1/f-nose   is   more
effective than white noise in enhancing the sensitivity. Another interesting finding comes from the
group of J J Collins showing that subliminal tactile stimuli can slightly improve the score in the
balance tests (quiet stance). In one experiment (Gravelle  et al.  2002) electrical stimulation at the
knee was used, in another experiment small vibrating nylon rods under the feet were employed
(Priplata  et al.  2002). The amplitude of the stimuli was tuned to a level where the participant no
longer was consciously aware of it. One interpretation of these results is that the subliminal stimuli
improves the sensitivity of the feedback control mechanism in line with the theory of SR. The
Collins group have already tested vibrating soles aimed at persons with impoverished balance (as is
the case with many elders).

An   important   point   thus   is   that   “noise”   need   not  necessarily   be   considered   as   a   detrimental
“disturbance” but may be precondition for the optimal functioning of the sensory organs. However,
this aspect of “noise” seems not to have been explicitly integrated in any of the published models of
balance. However, for stick-balancing Cabrera and Milton (2002) have suggested that  parametric
noise could be a significant element of the balancing mechanism. Thought stick-balancing is not the
same thing as quite stance, it might be of interest understanding quiet stance since in both cases
some sort of a feedback system is involved, and in both cases the apparent noisy behaviour is a
prominent feature. In the experiments a 62 cm long stick was balanced on the finger tip and two
LED-markers on both ends of the stick were applied so that its position an attitude could be recored
with the help of three video cameras. For a homogenous stick of length l and mass m whose pivot
point  only  moves  horizontally  along  a line  we   obtain  the  Newtonian   equation  (of   the  inverted
pendulum) on the form

(10)

where 0(t) denotes the position of the pivot point (finger tip) along the horizontal x-axis, and a is
the angle (attitude) of the stick in relation to the vertical direction (in the sagittal plane). In this
model the motion of the stick is controlled by shifting the position 0(t), which is thus the “control
variable”. Cabrera and Milton suggests as a first approximation to set the control term proportional
to the deviation  a from the vertical direction. One important qualification is that the control term
involves   a time   delay    due  to  the  sensimotor  system.  Thus,   with  rescaling, and  an  additional
friction term, the equation for this model may be written as

Here the time has been rescaled (t  u = t/) so that the delay  appears as a factor of the frictional
constant G  and the “eigen-frequency”  of the stick. R in the last rhs term sizes the magnitude of
the restoring force. The factor  does not appear here since this control term corresponds to the force
and thus the acceleration of the hand (second order time derivative of 0(t)). The central idea of the
authors   is   the  suggestion   that   the  “force”  R  may be  described,  in  accordance  with   the   idea  of
“parametric resonance”, as a sum of a constant part and a fluctuating part, 

(12)

where  is supposed to represent Gaussian noise. (A somewhat related notion is that of “parametric
oscillators”, see e.g. Landau & Lifshitz 1976, §27; José & Saletan 1998, §7.3.) The implication is
that  muscular  force  is  supposed   to   be  fluctuating.  Indeed, there  are  indications  of  spontaneous
vibrations of the muscles (Basmaijan and De Luca 1985, p. 152). In the synapses, between motor
neurons and muscles, there is a degree of chance operating in the secretion of transmitter substances

such as acethylcoline. 

Here we have to point out one problem with the paper by Cabrera and Milton (2002). They interpret
the angle (a /) in (10) and (11) as the angle (“latitude”) which the stick makes with the vertical in
3D-space, not as the angle in the sagittal plane which is presupposed by the 2D physical model in
(10-11) (where  a  is the angle of rotation around the  y-axis if the  x-axis is taken to be along the
anterior/posterior direction and z-axis to be along the vertical direction).  Whereas the latitude varies
from 0 to 180 degrees, the sagittal angle a implied in (10) and (11) varies from -180 to 180 degrees,
and average position of the stick may be supposed to be  a  = 0. Since Cabrera and Milton have
calculated the latitude angle from the data they naturally get a positive average angle. Indeed, if we
assume that  2  2 R0

 then there is a non-zero stationary solution to (11) given by

However, this solution is non-physical because it would imply a constant acceleration    ¨0   of the
hand (see (10)). Thus, there is a mix-up between the interpretation of the angle and the physical
model in their paper. As a contrast Mehta  and  Schaal (2002) which also  analyze  stick-balancing,
clearly distinguish between the motion in the A/P- and in the M/L-direction. For small deviations
from   the   vertical   direction,   equ   (10)   is   a   good   approximation   for   the   dynamics   of   the   A/P-
oscillations   (the  full   3D  equations  are  a bit  more complicated  but  reduce to  (10)  for   the  A/P-
oscillations if the deviations from the vertical direction may be supposed to be small).

Still it might be of some interest to scrutinize (11) from the mathematical point of view. By varying
 and R0 we can determine the region of stability in the ( R0)-plane. For small -values a Taylor-
development can be used with suggests that in this case (also neglecting the contribution by the
noise) the region of stability is given by

R0 2  2

2   −2  2R0  e−=0

More exactly, if we make the solution ansatz  et  in the linearized version of (11) (replacing sin()
with ) and again neglect the noise, we obtain the characteristic equation

whose zero-points in  with negative real parts correspond to the stable states (for an analysis in the
case G = 0 see Atay (1999)). The interesting physical idea proposed by Cabrera and Milton (even if
the model does not directly apply to stick-balancing in this form) is that the system tends to stay
close to boundary of the region of stability. They propose that such a mechanism could shorten the
effective reaction times of the feedback control and also explain the peculiar statistical properties

they found in their data associated with intermittence (more on that below). We may add, that on
physical grounds a quite obvious general strategy in controlling the stick could be to apply jerky
motions; that is, short rapid accelerations/decelerations of the hand6, since it has a quite a limited
range of movement.  

In a subsequent paper Cabrera and Milton (2002b)  associated  the tendency to stay close to the
boundary of stability with the concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) advanced by Per Bak,
Chao   Tang  and  Kurt   Wiesenfeld   (1987)   –   for   a   review   see   Jensen   (1998).   The   paradigmatic
example is that of a heap of sand. Grain is added to grain, eventually small instabilities appear in the
heap causing small avalanches that may now and then discharge larger avalanches. Analogously it
has been proposed that many biological systems operate close to a critical instability thus enhancing
their sensitivity. (For a discussion of SOC in relation to the brain see e.g. Linkenkaer-Hansen 2002.)
In the case with the stick-balancing one might speculate that nearness to the in/stability region
quickens the reactions, as suggested by Cabrera and Milton. They also propose (Cabrera and Milton
2002b) on the basis of their data that the time series of the latitude-angle of the stick exhibits the
characteristics of a so called Lévy-flight (the concept discussed e.g. by Jespersen et al. 1999) which
generalizes Brownian motion. A Lévy-process with the Lévy-parameter  0 <  < 2 has a distribution
which in the force-free case can be described by a differential equation (a special case of the fractal
Fokker-Planck equations) of the form

The fractal derivative in (13) may be defined in terms of Fourier-transformations  (Riesz), or via
fractal integration (see e.g. Saichev and Woyczyñski 1997 § 6.9). The limiting case  = 2 coincides
with the ordinary Brownian motion  which indeed has a Gaussian distribution. Equ (13) can be
solved using Fourier-transformations. Given the boundary condition

the distribution will asymptotically approach (can also be guessed via scaling arguments)

According to Cabrera  and  Milton (2002b) the distribution of the change  D v  in the velocity, for a
fixed time interval D
t, shows the characteristics of the Lévy-statistics. The distribution seems to be
clearly   different   from   Gaussian   distribution   and   there   is   a  significant  difference   also   between
beginners   and   experienced   balancers.   Beginners   have   a   more  truncated  distribution;   that   is,   a
smaller proportion of big velocity changes. Furthermore it was found that the return probability
density –   the  probability  of the time interval between successive crossings of  threshold  angle –
adheres to a power law 

6 One could make a comparison with the so called “bang-bang” control in control theory.

The same distribution is found for ordinary Brownian motion too; indeed, for fractal time series we
have in general (Ding and Yang 1995)

where  D  = 2 -  H  is the fractal dimension of the curve (H  = 0.5 for ordinary Brownian motion).
Heagy  et   alii  (1994)   have   however   also   demonstrated   that   the   exponent   -3/2   is   a   universal
characteristics of intermittency; that is, fractal processes with laminar phases interspersed with big
excursions. Cabrera and Milton advances the idea that (15) implies that parametric noise enables
swifter reactions than the typical neuromuscular delay around 100 ms seems to allow. Atay (2002)
describes a class of simple delayed feedback control systems where asymptotic stability is possible
only if the delay satisfies (homogeneous inverted pendulum of length l)

For  = ca 100 ms we get for the corresponding length 15 cm. Indeed, for most people it is probably
impossible to balance an ordinary pen on the fingertip. However, if intermittency helps, could this
be demonstrated by being able to balance short sticks than expected on the basis of reaction time
alon?

The idea connected with model (11-12) is that the system is to live close to the edge of  instability
region whereby  fluctuations  may throw  it into  the instability region, initiating an  excursion  till
another  fluctuation maybe will bring it  back to the stability region. Even if the model  as such
applied to the balancing is wanting, the discovery of intermittency and the Lévy-distribution in the
stick balancing data warrants further study. Other similar experiments could be suggested, such as
the balancing on a mono cycle (for a mathematical analysis see Johnson 2002). Mention should also
be made of the more traditional theories of control, such as has been forwarded by Mehta and
Schaal   (2002)  in   connection with  stick  balancing.  One  idea  being that  the  balancing mimics   a
Kalman-filter based control. The biological control system is assumed to predict the evolution and
to use this prediction in order to compensate for the time delay in the control loop (Wolpert et al.
1995; Wolpert 1997). A classical “dead time” compensating control model is the so called Smith
predictor   (Smith   1957)   and   it   has   been   proposed   that   the   cerebellum   harbors   internal   models
(Dingwell et al. 2001) of movement patterns of the Smith type (Miall et al. 1993). An interesting
recent study (Moreau and Sontag 2003) describes a general non-linear adaptive control mechanism,
and it is suggested that it could explain the automatic fine tuning of the parameters in models of the
saccadic movements of the eye and the oscillations of the cilia in the ear. 

From the dynamical point of view an interesting query is whether quiet stance and stick balancing in

some sense belong to the same “universality class”. Anyway, the “noise” seems to be an integrated
part of the neuromuscular system. In quiet stance a stream of signals is emanating from muscles,
joints, skin, tendons, eyes, ears, etc. Sometimes the sensor inputs give contradictory information
about balance and the body position. Also there is the phenomenon of adaption; a constant stimuli
wears   off.   Perhaps   the   erratic   swaying,   seen   from   this   perspective,   may   act   as   an   updating
mechanism of the “body-memory”, analogous to the brain oscillations around 10 – 20 Hz that are
hypothesized  to   keep   the   brain   agile   (Linkenkaer-Hansen   2002).   The   subliminal  stimuli  may
enhance this updating mechanism,  whereas too much noise masks the relevant information and
perturbs the balance adversely.

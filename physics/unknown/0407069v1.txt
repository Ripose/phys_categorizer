Abstract 

A recent advance  in  optical  coherence  tomography (OCT), termed swept-source OCT, 

is generalized into a new technique, Fourier-domain OCT.  It represents a realization of 

a  full- field  OCT  system  in  place  of  the  conventional  serial  image  acquisition  in 

transverse directions typically implemented  in  “flying- spot”  mode.   To realize the  full-

field image acquisition, a Fourier holography system illuminated with a swept-source is 

employed  instead  of  a  Michelson  interferometer  commonly  used  in  OCT.      Fourier-

domain OCT  offers  a  new  leap  in  signal- to-noise  ratio  improvement,  as  compared  to 

flying-spot OCT systems.  This paper presents experimental evidence that the signal-to-

noise ratio of this new technique is indeed  improved.

Optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT)  is  playing  an  important  role  in  the  advancement  of  non-

invasive  optical  imaging  in  biomedicine  by  way  of  its  ability  to  generate  high-resolution images of 

unprecedented  quality,  deep  within  turbid  media .1,2    Its  unique  imaging  advantage  relies  on  the 

coherence  gating  which  can  discriminate  reflections  at  a  precise  depth  within  the  medium.    The 

technique  is  based  upon  the  Michelson  interferometer  with  the  sample  located  in  one  arm  and  a 

reference  mirror  in  the  other.    The  generation  of  interference  fringes  is  confined  to  reflections 

occurring only at depths in the sample medium corresponding to the reference arm delay to within the 

coherence length of the source.  By using a broadband optical source, such as a super-radiant  light 

emitting  diode,  this  depth  resolution  is  on  the  scale  of  the  micrometre-scale  temporal  coherence 

length, hence the term coherence gating.3,1  In its conventional form, time-domain OCT (TD-OCT), 4 

the reference  optical  delay is scanned to acquire  one-dimensional reflectivity prof ile of the sample, 

termed A-scan.  This scanning delay is typically realized by a mechanically driven  actuator.5  If the 

probe  beam  is  scanned  across  the  sample  in  one  plane  (B-scan),  a  series  of  slices,  i.e., 

tomographs  of  the  reflectivity  profile  of  a  sample  may  be  built  up,  resulting  in  a  two-

dimensional  (2D),  cross-sectional  morphological  image  of  the  sample.    With  addition  of 

another transverse scanning plane (C-scan), a three-dimensional image of the sample is built.  

The rastering across the sample in the transverse directions is realized by means of “flying-spot” 

configuration,  typically  implemented  by  mechanical  scanners.    A  major  shortcoming  of  this  serial 

pixel-by-pixel  image  acquisition  technique  is  its  theoretical  suboptimal  signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) 

resulting from shot noise arising from the intense reference beam impinging on a single detector.  

A novel principle to increase the SNR called spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) was proposed 

by Fercher et al.6, Häusler et al.7 and demonstrated by several groups.8,9,10,11  Its principle innovation 

rests in optically dispersing the interferometric signal with a spectrometer. The spectral components 

are  sampled  with  a  linear  detector  array,  in  place  of  the  single  detector  used  in  TD-OCT.    The 

reference arm delay is stationary, as opposed to the scanning optical delay in TD-OCT.  As there are 

no time-varying parameters, the optical output is constant and is integrated over exposure time.   The 

detector array samples a series of spectral bins, which are equally spaced in wavenumber.

The  axial  image  may  be  recovered  by  performing  a  digital  Fourier  transform  (DFT)  of  the 

spectrometer  output.    The  key  advantage  of  SD-OCT  is  that  the  N  detector  signals  are  added 

coherently , whereas the noise components are summed  incoherently. This produces an improvement 

of  SNR  which  is  proportional  to  number  of  detectors  and depends on the relative bandwidth of an 

individual  detector.12  With  this  approach  a  21.7-dB  improvement  in  SNR  has  been  achieved.10  In 

addition, the need for the mechanical scanning delay line is no longer necessary. This also holds true 

for  swept-source  OCT  (SS-OCT),  where  the  combination  of  a  swept-source  and  single  detector  is 

used. The swept-source has a narrow linewidth and is swept over a broad wavelength range. 

In spite of these advances, SD-OCT and SS-OCT still rely on serial pixel-by-pixel flying-spot 

image  acquisition  in  the  transverse  dimensions.    Apart  from  the  inconvenience  of  its  typical 

mechanical  implementation,  this  single  point  sampling  in  the  spatial  dimension  degrades  the  SNR 

than what could be ultimately achieved by full-field image acquisition by a parallel array.  

We  propose  to  extend  the  technique  of  image  acquisition  in  the  Fourier  domain  to  the 

transverse  spatial  dimension,  resulting  in  a  fully-optimised  technique  termed  Fourier-domain OCT 

(FD-OCT).13    We  are  departing  from  the  conventional  Michelson  interferometer  configuration 

towards digital holographic techniques.14  Our proposal may be considered  as a combination of SS-

OCT and digital Fourier holography.   The full-field en face image is captured holographically in the 

Fourier-domain using an array in place of the conventional flying-spot technique, as shown in Fig. 1.  

For each swept-source wavenumber {k1, k2,….kM}, a 2D-Fourier-hologram is recorded, a complete set 

of which forms a 3D data array.  Given that each hologram is scaled by the Fourier-transformed depth 

information of the SS-OCT, the complete data set is essentially a 3D-Fourier-transform of the object. 

Hence the 3D morphological image may be reconstructed via a 3D-DFT.  

We  expect  a  further  improvement  in  SNR  from  this  holographic  method  in  each  of  the 

transverse dimensions which represents a significant advance.   SNR improvement  is calculated to be 

27 dB per transverse  dimension for a typical CCD array  of linear size of 1000 pixels , provided shot 

noise  is  the  dominant  source  of  noise.  In addition, the sweep-source update rate is expected to be 

reduced to the video frame rate,  in comparison with the kilohertz-rates used  for the flying-spot SS-

OCT.15  In this letter, we present a crucial test-case, demonstrating experimentally that the principles 

of  optimising  the  SNR  extend  to  the  transverse  dimension  in  transmission  mode.  We  use  the 

transmission mode to simplify the experimental setup but it is possible to reconfigure the experiment 

in the reflection mode.  It is important to note that the SNR improvement in context of SD-OCT was 

first  demonstrated  by  de  Boer  et  al.12  using  hybrid  timed-domain  SD-OCT  (TD/SD-OCT).    The 

demonstrated improvement was subsequently confirmed by greatly improved imaging performance of 

SD-OCT  systems.    In  close  analogy  with  this  work,  we  present  the  demonstration  of  the  SNR 

improvement in one transverse dimension using hybrid TD/FD-OCT. 

The experimental setup of the hybrid TD/FD-OCT system is presented in Fig. 2.  The optical 

circuit represents a Fourier holography system with one important difference:  the reference fiber is 

not stationary.  An output beam from He-Ne laser of wavelength ? = 632.8 nm is equally split (50:50) 

between the fiber-optic sample  and reference  arms, whose distal ends are situated at the front focal 

plane of a Fourier lens of the focal length f = 100 mm.  The fibers are closely separated in the vertical 

y-direction (< 1 mm) to allow the horizontal translation of the reference fiber, i.e. along the x-axis (see 

Fig. 2).  The sample fiber is  placed  on-axis and represents a point-like source.   The reference fiber 

produces a plane reference wave that is incident at an angle on the detector that is placed at the back 

focal plane of the Fourier lens.  The reference and sample optical fields interfere across the detector 

array to produce an interference pattern, assuming equal power in both arms the  irradiance, I, is given 

by the following equation:

direction) slit was placed in front of the detector array to eliminate the signal acquisition artefact due 

to the finite vertical separation of the fibers, which was necessary to allow the reference fiber  non-

obstructed pass across the optical axis. 

 

Translation of the reference fiber causes variation of the fringe frequency in time.  It results in 

the generation of a time-varying signal at each detector element,  di  that is found by integration of the 

detector photoresponse [Eq. (1)] over the detector element width, d:

where  di  is the detector current,  A is the detector area,  ? is the  quantum efficiency,  e is the 

charge of an electron, h is Planck’s constant, c is the speed of light, and n is the index of the detector 

element, where  n = 0 denotes the on-axis detector element.  Examination of Eq. (2) shows that the 

signal represents a sinc-function envelope on a constant background that peaks at t = 0, whereas the 

signal carrier frequency is primarily determined by the index of the detector element; the greater the 

index,  the  greater  the  carrier  frequency.    The  first  factor  of  the  a.c.  term  of  Eq.  (2)  describes  the 

frequency chirp.  The chirp is  not significant as long as the signal is recorded  in the vicinity of the 

central peak of the sinc-function, and is, therefore, omitted in our analysis.  

In our experiment, we individually recorded the temporal signals from four adjacent detectors 

for a single scan of the reference arm.   The detector elements were placed considerably off-axis to 

attain  higher  carrier  frequency,  since  the  translation  stage  velocity  was  limited  to  300  µm/s.    The 

reference fiber was scanned and the  time-varying signal of each detector element was digitized and 

stored on a personal computer.   

We  process  the  recorded  four  signals  by  using  two  following  filtering  schemes.    The  first 

scheme  is  representative  of  TD-OCT.    The  four  channel  amplitude  spectrums  were  summed  up

following  broad  bandpass  filtering  using  an  4th-order  Butterworth  filter  (bandwidth  25.8  Hz).  The 

processed  signal  is  shown  in  Fig.  3  (dotted  curve).    The  second  scheme  is  representative  of  the 

TD/FD-OCT scheme, where each detector element time-varying signal was individually narrow band-

pass filtered (bandwidth of 17.3 Hz), and these frequency responses were summed in Fourier domain.  

The  result  is  shown  in  Fig.  3  (solid  curve).    The  in-band  noise  power  density  in  the  narrow  band-

passed case was reduced by a factor of 3.38 and the signal power density was decreased by a factor of 

1.20  improving  the  overall  SNR  by  a  factor  of  2.82.    It  agrees  well  with  the  expected  SNR 

improvement of 2.98 previously demonstrated TD/SD-OCT case12.  

 

In conclusion,  we  have  introduced  a  new  OCT  technique  that  represents  a combination  of 

swept-source OCT and digital Fourier holography. We believe it is capable of superseding the already 

achieved signal-to-noise improvements demonstrated by spectral-domain OCT by  utilizing a second 

dimension in our detection arm to further increase our SNR. In addition,  Fourier-domain OCT will 

considerably reduce the required update rate of the swept-source as the need for raster scanning in the 

sample arm is eliminated.  We have used  a hybrid of FD-OCT and time-domain OCT  techniques to 

test the signal-to-noise ratio improvement in the transverse dimension.  Our results demonstrate that 

optimization of the SNR can be, indeed, generalized to include the transverse dimension.

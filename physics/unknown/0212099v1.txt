Abstract

Using high-resolution γ−ray spectroscopy,

the terrestrial gamma radiation in all

the

predominant types of geological rock formations appearing in Cyprus was measured. Soil

samples were collected from each rock type, sealed in 1-litre plastic Marinelli beakers, and

measured in the laboratory for 24 hours each. From the measured γ−ray spectra, activity

concentrations were determined for 232Th (range from 1.3 to 52.8 Bq kg−1), 238U (from 0.9

to 90.3 Bq kg−1) and 40K (from 13 to 894 Bq kg−1). Elemental concentrations mean values of

(2.8 ± 0.7)  ppm, (1.3 ± 0.3)  ppm and (0.6 ± 0.1) % were extracted, for thorium, uranium

and potassium, respectively. Absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were calculated to be in
the range of 0.1−50 nGy h−1, depending on the geological features, with an overall mean

value of (14.7 ± 7.3) nGy h−1. The corresponding effective dose rates per person outdoors

were estimated to be between 0.1 and 61.4 µSv y−1, assuming a 20% occupancy factor.

1. Introduction

Natural radioactivity is composed of the cosmogenic and primordial

radionuclides.

Cosmogenic radionuclides, such as 3H, 7Be, 14C, and 22Na, are produced by the interaction

of cosmic-ray particles (mainly high-energetic protons)

in the earth’s atmosphere.

Primordial radionuclides (also called terrestrial background radiation) are formed by the

process of nucleosynthesis in stars. Only those radionuclides with half-lives comparable to

the age of the earth, and their decay products, can still be found today on earth, e.g. 40K,

and the radionuclides from the 238U and 232Th series. Gamma radiation from these

radionuclides represents the main external source of irradiation of the human body.

The external radiation exposure arises mainly from cosmic rays and from terrestrial

radionuclides occurring at trace levels in all soils. While absorbed dose rate in air from

cosmic radiation outdoors at sea level is about 30 nGy h−1 for the southern hemisphere

(UNSCEAR Report, 2000),

the specific levels due to terrestrial background radiation are

related to the types of rock from which the soils originate. Therefore,

the natural

environmental radiation mainly depends on geological and geographical conditions (Florou

and Kritidis, 1992). Higher radiation levels are associated with igneous rocks, such as

granite, and lower levels with sedimentary rocks. There are exceptions, however, as some

shales and phosphate rocks have relatively high content of radionuclides (UNSCEAR

Report, 1993).

The island of Cyprus has attracted a lot of geological interest because it contains a mafic

intrusive complex that is thought to represent an excellent example of an ophiolite slice

(Robinson and Malpas, 1998). The Cyprus ophiolite complex, known as Troodos Massif,

consists of pillow basalts overlying a sheeted dyke complex, and then an intrusive complex

2

of gabbro that grades downward into olivine gabbro, then into an intramafic body of

harzburgite and dunite. Some of the harzburgites are serpentinized. The upper parts of the

gabbro and the lower basalts are cut by many closely spaced diabase dykes that form

conspicuous sheeted masses. They are overlaid with fine-grained ferruginous, siliceous and

sulfide bearing sediments called umpres.

Investigations on terrestrial natural radiation have received particular attention worldwide

and led to extensive surveys in many counties (see UNSCEAR 2000 Report and further

references cited therein). They mainly serve as baseline data of natural radioactivity such

that man made possible contaminations can be detected and quantitatively determined.

They can further be used to assess public dose rates and to perform epidemiological studies.

The results obtained in each country can be exploited to enrich the world’s data bank,

which is highly needed for evaluating worldwide average values of radiometric and

dosimetric quantities (Al-Jundi, 2002).

There are no systematic data on this subject available for Cyprus. Only a few studies on

natural radioactivity and on indoor radon concentration measurements are reported by two

of the authors (Christofides, 1994; Christofides and Christodoulides, 1993). A pilot project

was therefore initiated aiming at systematically measuring the terrestrial gamma radiation

in Cyprus and at determining its contribution to the annual effective dose equivalent to the

population. Other part of the project includes measurement of radon concentration in

houses and public buildings (Anastasiou et al., 2002) as well as the detection of α−emitting

radioisotopes by utilizing radioanalytic techniques and high-resolution α-spectroscopy. In

this paper, the first results from natural gamma radiation measurements in all the types of

geological rock formations appearing in Cyprus (Figure 1) are presented. The experiments

3

have been carried out in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Department of Physics,

University of Cyprus, using a high-resolution γ−ray spectroscopic system.

2. Experimental method

2.1 Gamma-ray detection system

A stand-alone high-resolution spectroscopic system is used for the measurement of the

energy spectrum of the emitted gamma rays in the energy range between 50 keV and 3000

keV. The system consists of a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (coaxial cylinder of

55 mm in diameter and 73 mm in length) with an efficiency of 30%, relative to a 3″×3″

NaI(Tl) scintillator. The detector is mounted on a cryostat which is dipped into a 30-litre

dewar filled with liquid nitrogen. Experimental arrangement for spectra collection includes

the high-voltage detector bias supply, equipped with a remote shutdown feature, and signal-

processing electronics. The latter include a spectroscopy main amplifier which incorporates

an efficient pile-up rejector, and a Multi-Channel Buffer (MCB) which is a PC-based plug-

in PCI card consisting of an 8k ADC. An advanced Multi-Channel Analyzer (MCA)

emulation software (MAESTRO-32) allows data acquisition, storage, display and online

analysis of the acquired γ−spectra.

The detector is surrounded by a graded−Z cylindrical shield consisting of lead, iron, and

aluminum with thickness of 5 cm, 1 cm, and 1 cm, respectively, which provides an efficient

suppression of background gamma radiation present at the laboratory site. The energy-

dependent detection efficiency has been determined using a calibrated 152Eu gamma

reference source (standard Marinelli beaker with 85 mm bore diameter), which has an

4

active volume of 1000 ml and an average density of 1 g cm−3. The energy resolution

(FWHM) achieved is 1.8 keV at the 1.33 MeV reference transition of 60Co.

2.2 Sample collection and counting

According to the geological features of Cyprus shown in Fig.1, samples have been carefully

collected from each type of the geological formations. Samples from different places of the

same rock formation have been mixed together. A total of 28 samples have been collected

(Table 1) which represent the predominant rock formations of Cyprus*. Measured samples

were sieved through 0.2-mm mesh, sealed in standard 1000 ml Marinelli beakers, dry-

weighed and stored for at least four weeks before counting in order to allow the in-growth

of uranium and thorium decay products and achievement of equilibrium for 238U and 232Th

with their respective progeny (Hamby and Tynybekov, 2000; Al-Jundi, 2002). However,

significant disequilibrium is uncommon in rocks older than 106 years, and the 232Th series

may be considered in equilibrium in most geological environments (Chiozzi et al., 2002).

Each sample was put into the shielded HPGe detector and measured for 24 hours (a typical

spectrum is shown in Fig. 2). Prior to the samples measurement, the environmental gamma

background at the laboratory site has been determined with an empty Marinelli beaker

under identical measurement conditions. It has been later subtracted from the measured

γ−ray spectra of each sample.

Each measured γ−ray spectrum has been analyzed offline by a dedicated software program

(GammaVision-32), which performs a simultaneous fit to all the significant photopeaks

appearing in the spectrum. Menu-driven reports are available for summaries including

*

Samples from the geological formations consisting the Pentadaktylos mountains in the northern part of

Cyprus could not be collected, because of the division of the island by force since 1974 (see Fig. 1).

5

centroid channel, energy, net area counts, background counts, intensity and width of

identified and unidentified peaks in the spectrum, as well as peak and average activity in Bq

kg−1 for each detected radionuclide. The results of reported activity concentrations obtained

for each of the measured samples and average activity for samples of ophiolitic and

sedimentary origin are summarized in table 1.

2.3 Calculation of elemental concentrations

Following the spectrum analysis, count rates for each detected photopeak and activity per

mass unit (specific activity or radiological concentration) for each of the detected nuclides

are calculated. The specific activity (in Bq kg−1),

EiA , of a nuclide i and for a peak at

energy E, is given by:

A
Ei

where

EiN is the Net Peak Area of a peak at energy Ε,

Eε is the detection efficiency at

energy Ε, t is the counting livetime,

dγ is the number of gammas per disintegration of this

nuclide for a transition at energy E, and Ms is the mass in kg of the measured sample. If

there is more than one peak in the energy analysis range for a nuclide, then an attempt to

average the peak activities is made. The result is then the weighted average nuclide activity.

Based on the measured γ-ray photopeaks, emitted by specific radionuclides in the 232Th and

238U decay series and in 40K, their radiological concentrations in samples collected were

determined. Calculations relied on establishment of secular equilibrium in the samples, due

to the much smaller lifetime of daughter radionuclides in the decay series of 232Th and 238U.

More specifically, the 232Th concentration was determined from the average concentrations

6

of 212Pb and 228Ac in the samples, and that of 238U was determined from the average

concentrations of the 214Pb and 214Bi decay products. Thus, an accurate measurement of

232Th and 238U radiological concentrations was made, whereas a true measurement of 40K

concentration was achieved.

Radiological concentrations of 232Th, 238U and 40K were then converted into total elemental

concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively, according to the following

where FΕ is the fraction of element E in the sample, ΜΕ is the atomic mass (kg mol−1), λE is

the decay constant (s−1) of the parent radioisotope, ΝΑ is Avogadro’s number (6.023×1023

atoms mol−1), fA,E is the fractional atomic abundance of 232Th, 238U or 40K in nature, C is a

constant (with a value of 100 or 1,000,000) that converts the ratio of the element’s mass to

soil mass into a percentage or ppm, and Αi is the radiological concentration of 40K (n=1) or

that of selected daughter radionuclides in the decay series of 232Th and 238U (n=2). Total

elemental concentrations are reported in units of parts per million (ppm) for thorium and

uranium, and of percent (%) for potassium.

2.4 Derivation of the gamma dose rates in air outdoors

If natural radioactive nuclides are uniformly distributed in the ground, dose rates at 1 m

above the ground surface are calculated by the following formula (Kohshi et al., 2001):

Dose rate (nGy h−1) = Concentration of nuclide (Bq kg−1)

(3)

×××× Conversion factor (nGy h−1 per Bq kg−1)

7

The methodology used for the derivation of the gamma dose rates was introduced by Beck

and De Planque (1968) and Beck et al. (1972). They used the polynomial expansion matrix

equation method for solving the soil/air transport problem in order to calculate the exposure

rates 1 m above ground level for distributed sources of gamma emitters in soil. Kocher and

Sjoreen (1985) using the point-kernel integration method have also calculated conversion

factors (absorbed dose rate in air per unit activity per unit of soil mass, nGy h−1 per

Bq kg−1). In the 1990’s Monte Carlo techniques have been exploited almost exclusively in

order to calculate absorbed dose in air. More complete studies for the calculation of

conversion factors were performed by Chen (1991), K. Saito and P. Jacob (1995) and

recently by Clouvas et al. (2000). In these studies different Monte Carlo codes were used,

such as the MCNP code of Los Alamos (1986), the GEANT code of CERN (1993) and a

Monte Carlo code (called MC) developed in the Nuclear Technology Laboratory of the

Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

The absorbed gamma dose rate in air is mainly determined from 212Pb (photon energy 238

keV), 208Tl (583 keV), 212Bi (727 keV) and 228Ac (911 keV) for the 232Th series, and from

214Pb (352 keV) and 214Bi (609 keV) for the 238U series. Due to the small fractional yield

and relatively low energy of the emitted photons, radionuclides such as 226Ra and 224Ra can

be neglected (Clouvas et al., 2001). In addition, the well-known interference between the

gamma line of 226Ra (186.2 keV) and 235U (185.7 keV) is inevitable, especially in the

presence of a relatively high uranium concentration (Canet, 1990) and, therefore, the

above-mentioned line was not used for the determination of 238U. No other than naturally

occurring radionuclides were detected in the measured samples, with the exception of a

8

small contamination of 137Cs due to the Chernobyl nuclear accident. Its contribution to the

total dose is insignificant and has been neglected.

The dose contribution of one photon energy to the total dose rate due to all photon energies

emitted from a specific radionuclide can be easily deduced from the above Monte Carlo

simulations. In table 2, the dose rate conversion factors (DRCF) for different radionuclides

are summarized, as deduced by Beck et al., Saito and Jacob and Clouvas et al. They have to

be multiplied by the measured radiological concentration in order to deduce the dose rate

due to the entire series. It should be pointed out here that, using this calculation, the dose

rate for 232Th and 238U series is the average for the different dose rates deduced by the

different gamma peaks belonging to each series and not the sum. For 40K the dose rate

conversion factor

is simply the value that should be multiplied by the measured

concentration at the energy of 1460 keV, in order to deduce the dose rate due to 40K.

The comparison between the results obtained by the three Monte Carlo codes and the

results obtained previously by others indicate a relative agreement (less than 15% of

difference) for photon energies above 1500 keV. However, the agreement is not so good

(difference of 20-30%) for the low-energy photons (e.g.

lower than 200 keV). The

differences between the results of the three Monte Carlo codes and the results obtained by

other researchers, presented in table 2, are 15% for 232Th series, 18% for 238U series and

10% for 40K. Clouvas et al. point out that the most accurate results are obtained by the

MCNP code, probably due to the use of the point detector by the MCNP. In the present

work, the considered dose rate conversion factor for 232Th and 238U series, and for 40K, used

in all dose rate calculations, is just the average of the total value for each series given by the

9

three Monte Carlo codes. Calculations were done for every identified element and the

average value for each series was considered.

Finally, in order to make a rough estimate for the annual effective dose outdoors, one has to

take into account the conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to effective dose and

the outdoor occupancy factor. In the UNSCEAR recent

reports (1993, 2000),

the

Committee used 0.7 Sv Gy−1 for the conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to

effective dose received by adults, and 0.2 for the outdoor occupancy factor. Effective dose

rate outdoors in units of µSv per year is calculated by the following formula:

Effective dose rate (µµµµSv y−−−−1) = Dose rate (nGy h−−−−1) ×××× 24 h ×××× 365.25 d

(4)

×××× 0.2 (occupancy factor) ×××× 0.7 Sv Gy−−−−1 (conversion coefficient) ×××× 10−−−−3

In table 3 the results obtained for the dose outdoors and the corresponding effective dose

assessment for the 232Th and 238U series, and 40K for sample 23 (Montmorilonite –

Bentonitic clay) are displayed.

3. Results and discussion

As shown in table 1, activity concentrations of 232Th ranged from 1.3 to 52.8 Bq kg−1, of

238U from 0.9 to 90.3 Bq kg−1 and of 40K from 13 to 894 Bq kg−1. Of all the 28 samples

measured in this study, Melange and Montmorilonite appear

to have the highest

concentrations of 232Th, whereas Raised Marine Terrace Deposits in Klavdhia village and

Celestite exhibit the highest concentration of 238U. Troodos Upper Pillow Lavas (Olivine

and Picrite Basalts) appear to have much higher concentration of 40K, when compared with

the concentrations of all the other samples, reaching levels up to 894.2 Bq kg−1. In general,

10

activity concentration of 232Th and 238U is rather low in all the samples measured; this is

particularly true in ophiolites, which show the lowest concentration of those radionuclides.

Average concentration of 232Th and 238U in samples of ophiolitic origin is just (2.1 ± 0.2)

and (6.5 ± 4.4) Bq kg−1, respectively, whereas in sediments the corresponding values

increase to (16.7 ± 3.7) and (21.0 ± 5.5) Bq kg−1, respectively. In addition, average

concentration of 40K is (147.3 ± 79.3) Bq kg−1 for ophiolites and (197.5 ± 35.2) Bq kg−1 for

samples of sedimentary origin. Calculated median values in all samples of both ophiolitic

and sedimentary origin are: 11, 15 and 178 Bq kg−1, for 232Th, 238U and 40K concentrations,

respectively, while revised median values worldwide (UNSCEAR Report, 2000) are: 30, 35

and 400 Bq kg−1, respectively. This reveals that the mean concentration levels measured in

Cyprus from naturally occurring radioisotopes are at least by a factor of two lower than the

corresponding values obtained worldwide.

The calculated elemental total concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium are

plotted in Fig. 3 for our twenty-eight samples collected from all over the island. Measured

arithmetic mean concentrations over all samples are: (2.8 ± 0.7) ppm, (1.3 ± 0.3) ppm and

(0.6 ± 0.1)% for thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively. For comparison, Myrick et

al. (1983) have determined arithmetic mean concentrations and standard deviations of

thorium and uranium in surface soils in more than 300 samples obtained from locations

around the United States. The corresponding values are: (8.9 ± 4.2) ppm and (3.0 ± 2.5)

ppm, respectively. Also, Chang et al. (1974) reported the concentrations of thorium,

uranium and potassium in earthen building materials of Taiwan to range from 14 to 16 ppm,

1.2 to 4.3 ppm and 0.15 to 12.8%, respectively. Potassium concentrations in a wide variety

of rock types are estimated to range from approximately 0.1 to 3.5% (Kohman and Saito,

11

1954). Very recently, Chiozzi et al. (2002) have performed a series of investigations on

different rock types at the Alps-Apennines transition, and found elemental concentrations

being in the range: 0.3−16.7 ppm, 0.3−5.6 ppm, and 0.14−5.14 %, for thorium, uranium and

potassium, respectively. Our extracted values (see Fig. 3) nicely fit to these results and, in

general, they fall within the range of most reported values from other worldwide areas.

In order to establish a relation between the soil nature and the natural gamma dose rate in

air, spectra were collected from several samples representing the predominant types of

rocks in Cyprus. Characteristic rock types can be separated into two main categories: those

that belong to the ophiolitic complex of Troodos (plutonic rocks, intrusive rocks – dykes

and extrusive rocks – lavas) and those of sedimentary origin. Ophiolitic origin rocks could

be characterized as undersaturated because they were formed by magma crystallization,

which begins on high melting point ferromagnesian silicates and calcic plagioclases poor in

silica. Ophiolitic rock types are mostly iron and magnesium saturated or oversaturated and

this allows the characterization of these types as basic and superbasic. None of these rock

types belongs to the category of silica-oversaturated rocks, which usually exhibit a

predominant contribution of 238U series elements. For rock types of sedimentary origin, a

predominant contribution of 238U series elements was found, followed by 40K and 232Th

series elements. Both natural chemical rocks like limestones etc. and terrigenous sediments

like sandstones etc. were considered, although the chemical and mechanical weathering of

original rocks makes difficult their association.

After the data analysis obtained for rocks of ophiolitic origin, a predominant contribution of

40K was found, mainly at the samples stemming from Troodos Upper and Lower Pillow

Lavas. Other samples such as Mathiatis Pyrite Mine Tippings show a strong contribution of

12

238U series elements, but none of the samples shows a significant contribution due to the

daughter elements of the 232Th series. Rocks of ophiolitic origin present a major

contribution to dose from 40K, which is significantly higher than those due to 232Th and 238U

series. The dose rates in air outdoors were calculated from concentrations of nuclides of

232Th and 238U series, and of 40K using equation (3). In the rocks of ophiolitic origin, the

extracted values ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 nGy h−1 with a mean of (0.2 ± 0.1) nGy h−1, from

0.1 to 19.1 nGy h−1 with a mean of (2.1 ± 1.7) nGy h−1, and from 0.1 to 33.8 nGy h−1 with a

mean of (5.1 ± 3.1) nGy h−1, respectively.

For sedimentary origin rocks, the contribution to dose due to 238U series elements is the

most important, followed by those from 40K and 232Th series elements. The corresponding

dose rates calculated from concentrations of nuclides of the 232Th and the 238U series, and of

40K, in the rocks of sedimentary origin, ranged from 0.1 to 18.3 nGy h−1 with a mean of

(5.1 ± 1.4) nGy h−1, from 1.2 to 34.3 nGy h−1 with a mean of (7.6 ± 2.1) nGy h−1, and from

0.1 to 16.2 nGy h−1 with a mean of (6.5 ± 1.4) nGy h−1, respectively. The total dose rates in

air outdoors calculated for rocks of ophiolitic and sedimentary origin ranged from 0.1 to

34.8 nGy h−1 with a mean of (7.4 ± 4.1) nGy h−1 and from 0.9 to 48.7 nGy h−1 with a mean

of (19.7 ± 3.8) nGy h−1, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates the measured relative contribution

to the total dose rate outdoors for the two main rock type categories indicated. For rocks of

ophiolitic origin, the relative contribution to dose due to 40K is 68%, followed by a lower

contribution due to 238U and 232Th series elements (29% and 3%, respectively). For

sedimentary origin rocks, dose contribution levels due to 40K, 232Th and 238U series are

comparable (34%, 27% and 39%, respectively).

13

The total mean absorbed dose rate in air outdoors from terrestrial radiation calculated for

both rock types of ophiolitic and of sedimentary origin has a value of (14.9 ± 7.3) nGy h−1.

In the “Survey of Natural Radiation Exposures”, the UNSCEAR refers especially for

Cyprus an average absorbed dose in air outdoors of 18 nGy h−1 with a range from 9 to 52

nGy h−1 (Christofides, 1994). According to the recent UNSCEAR reports (1993, 2000), the

corresponding worldwide average values range from 18 to 93 nGy h−1 and a typical range

variability for measured absorbed dose rates in air outdoors is from 10 to 200 nGy h−1. The

population-weighted values give an average absorbed dose rate in air outdoors from

terrestrial gamma radiation of 60 nGy h−1. It should be noted here that in the UNSCEAR

reports, dose rate conversion factors are taken from K. Saito and P. Jacob (1995), which are

10−20 % higher than the more accurate values obtained recently by various Monte Carlo

techniques (see table 2) and adopted in this work. The effective dose rates outdoors

estimated according to equation (4) for rocks of ophiolitic and sedimentary origin ranged

from 0.1 to 42.7 µSv y−1 with a mean of (10.1 ± 5.0) µSv y−1 and from 1.1 to 61.4 µSv y−1

with a mean of (27.5 ± 5.0) µSv y−1, respectively.

Finally, an attempt to find a relation between terrestrial radiation doses in air outdoors and

the nature of the rock, studying dose contributions of each natural series, 232Th and 238U,

and 40K that occur with different concentrations on rock composition. For rocks of

ophiolitic origin the highest dose rate is 34.8 nGy h−1 (42.7 µSv y−1) and was registered for

Troodos Upper Pillow Lavas, where the relative weight to dose is 96.9% for 40K, 1.7% for

238U series and 1.3% for 232Th series. The lowest dose rate that registered was 0.1 nGy h−1

for Harzburgite and Wehrlite. For rocks of sedimentary origin, the highest dose rate was 50

nGy h−1 (61.4 µSv y−1) for Raise Marine Terrace Deposits in Klavdhia village, where the

14

relative weight to the dose is 70.6% for 238U series, 16.4% for 40K and 13% for 232Th series.

The lowest dose rate registered was 0.9 nGy h−1 for Gypsum, and the relative weight is 90%

for 238U series and 10% for 232Th series.

4. Conclusions

High-resolution γ−ray spectroscopy is a powerful experimental tool in studying natural

radioactivity and determining elemental concentrations and dose rates in various rock types.

For the predominant rock types of Cyprus that were investigated, samples originated from

Troodos ophiolitic complex appear generally to have lower radionuclide concentrations, as

compared to those of sedimentary origin. The latter, in combination with phosphates,

carbonates and silicates, also present in sedimentary rocks, reveal a more significant

concentration, especially in uranium and thorium series elements. However, activity and

elemental concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium in the studied soil samples are

found to be normal. The extracted values are distinctly lower than the corresponding ones

obtained from other countries worldwide and, in general, they all fall within the range given

in the UNSCEAR Report (2000).

The mean absorbed dose rate in air outdoors amounts to (14.7 ± 7.3) nGy h−1, which is by

far below the corresponding population-weighted (world-averaged) value of 60 nGy h−1.

This implies that inhabitants of the island are subjected to a radiation exposure, which is

significantly lower than the corresponding exposure levels reported in other areas

worldwide. More systematic studies of the island’s geological formations are in progress

with the objective to create a digital radiological map of Cyprus, that would express the

exposure levels due to terrestrial gamma radiation, which mainly depends on the geological

15

features of Troodos ophiolite and the other sedimentary rocks. On the other hand, since

from these measurements only dose rates and effective dose rates outdoors can be

determined, additional studies are also required in order to be able to determine the dose

rates and effective dose rates indoors. This would provide the possibility to accurately

determine the public total effective dose rates due to natural radioactivity.

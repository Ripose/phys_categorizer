Abstract.  There  is  a  quickly  increasing  wealth  of  experimental  data  on  so-called  dusty  plasmas  i.  e.  ionized  gases  or 
usual plasmas that contain micron sized charged particles. Interest in these structures is driven both by their importance in 
many  astrophysical  as  well  as  commercial  situations.  Among  them  are  linear  and  nonlinear  wave  phenomena.  We 
consider the influence of dust charge fluctuations on stability of the ion-acoustic waves when the stream of particles is 
present. It is assumed that all grains of dust have equal masses but charges are not constant in time-they may fluctuate in 
time. The dust charges are not really independent of the variations of the plasma potentials. All modes will influence the 
charging mechanism, and feedback will lead to several new interesting and unexpected phenomena. The charging of the 
grains  depends  on  local  plasma  characteristics.  If  the  waves  disturb  these  characteristic,  then  charging  of  the  grains  is 
affected and the grain charge is modified, with a resulting feedback on the wave mode. In case considering here, when 
temperature of electrons is much greater then the temperature of the ions and temperature of electrons is not great enough 
for  further  ionization  of  the  ions,  we  show  that  stability  of  the  acoustic  wave  depends  only  one  phenomenological 
coefficient and relation betwee.

INTRODUCTION 

In ideal dusty plasmas, where all grains of dust have the same atomic numbers 

dZ and masses  

dm

, exist low 

frequency modes DIAW (Dust Ion Acoustic Wave) and DAW (Dust Acoustic Wave) described by fluid [1], [2] or 
kinetic model [3]. On the other hand in a real Dusty Plasmas charges of grains can fluctuate absorbing or emitting 
, and a masses 
some electrons[4], [5]. We assumed that fluctuation 

dZδ  is the same for all grains but: 

δ <<
d

Z

Z

d

of  grains 

  are  a  constant.  As  a  result  of  fluctuating  dust  charges  in  dusty  plasmas,  many  new  problems  can 

dm

appear  which  are  in  general  treatment  by  Verheest  [4].  We  consider  a  specific  problem  when  the  temperature  of 
electrons is much greater than the temperature of ions and temperature of electrons is not great enough for further 
ionization of the ions. Because the magnetic field is absent we conclude that our problem is onedimensional. In this 
case the continuity equations for specimens of dusty plasmas (grains of dust, ions, and electrons) can be written in 
the form: 

                                               

                                                                                    ( 1)

 STABILITY, INSTABILITY AND ION CONVECTIONS 

We assumed that ions have some convectional velocity

. In order to resolve problem of stability of DIAW, 

instead of to solve full fluid model of equation for dusty plasmas (continuity equations, fluid motion equations and 
Poisson equation ) we have to opportunity dispersion relation for ideal dusty plasmas (without fluctuations) [1]. The 
fluctuations of electrostatic potential 
plasmas. Next in results arise the fluctuations of the charges of dusty. Therefore we use ‘Linear response method’ 
[6] to solve dispersion relation for dusty plasmas with fluctuations. In order to applied mention above method we 
can write:

We have some analogy to Landau damped plasmas waves in kinetic theory: when convective and DIAW velocities 
have the same direction but phase velocity of wave is smaller than convective velocity we have instability. In other 
case the wave is damped and attenuation coefficient is proportional to eν . 

CONCLUSIONS 

 
 
Linear  response  method  make  possible  us  use  dispersion  relation  for  dust-ion-acoustic  wave  (DIAW)  without 
fluctuation  of  charges  of  grains  of  dust.  In  the  case  of  small  fluctuations  is  agreement  with  linear  approximation. 
Doppler  shift  frequency  in  ions  susceptibility  enable  us  use  linear  response  method  when  ions  have  convectional 
velocity.  We  have  some  analogy  to  Landau  damping:  when  convective  velocity  is  larger  than  phase  velocity  of 
wave, if they have the same direction, we have instability. In the other case, we have linear stability of DIAW, which 
enable phenomenological coefficient

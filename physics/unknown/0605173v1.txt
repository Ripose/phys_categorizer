Abstract
—The power of microwave generation in a nonrelativistic electron beam with virtual cathode formed
in a static retarding electric ﬁeld (low-voltage vircator system) has been studied experimentally and by means
of numerical simulation within the framework of a one-dimensional theory. The limits of applicability of the
one-dimensional theory have been experimentally determined.

Recently  [7–9],  we  proposed  and  studied  a  new
scheme of the oscillator with a VC (vircator) making
use of an intense nonrelativistic electron beam (i.e., a
beam with a microperveance 
 [10]). In
order to form a VC in the electron beam, this system
employs  a  scheme  with  an  additional  retardation  of
electrons. According to this scheme (called a low-volt-
age vircator), a nonstationary oscillating VC is formed
at the expense of strong retardation of electrons in the
drift  region,  which  makes  possible  the  generation  of
both  single-frequency  and  broadband  microwave  sig-
nals using electron beams with small total currents and
low densities [7]. In such regimes, it is possible to study
in  much  detail  the  physical  processes  in  electron
beams  with VCs.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  system
with  a  VC  and  a  retarded  electron  beam  is  also  of
interest  as  a  controlled  source  of  medium-power
broadband chaotic signals in the centimeter and milli-
meter wavelength range [8].

This Letter presents the results of an experimental
and theoretical investigation of the output energy char-
acteristics of a low-voltage vircator.

The experimental investigation of oscillations in the
electron beam with a VC was performed using as diode
scheme in which the beam formed by an electron-opti-
cal  system  (EOS)  was  injected  into  a  system  (see
Fig. 1) comprising two grid electrodes (
) form-
ing a retarding ﬁeld. The retarding ﬁeld was created by

small. As the

then decreases again. It should be noted that VC oscil-
lations observed in the regime of small retardation are
close to regular, and the spectrum of microwave radia-
tion is discrete. Upon a further increase in the relative
retarding potential difference, broadband chaotic oscil-
lations arise in the system [7], but a large retardation

Nonlinear  nonstationary  processes  in  a  beam  of
charged particles with a VC were simulated using the
particle-in-cell method [11, 12] within the framework
of a one-dimensional model of the drift region with a
retarding  ﬁeld.  The  space-charge  ﬁelds  were  deter-
mined by solving a one-dimensional Poisson equation.
Thus, the motion of electrons in the beam was consid-
ered as one-dimensional; this assumption is valid, but
not in all regimes of the vircator system under consid-
eration. The scheme of numerical calculations used in
this study is described in detail elsewhere [7].

In the theoretical study of the microwave generation
power, the output HSWS was modeled (following [13,
14]) by an equivalent long transmission line comprising
serially  connected  inductances 
  [H/m]  shunted  by
capacitances 
  [F/m].  Assuming  a  paraxial  electron

We also assume that the reverse inﬂuence of the HSWS
ﬁeld on the charge dynamics can be ignored (preset cur-
rent approximation). This assumption is valid provided

EGOROV  et  al.

that the electron ﬂux is not synchronized with the elec-
tromagnetic  wave  propagating  in  the  long  line  under
consideration. Telegrapher’s equations (1) were numer-
ically solved assuming that the line is matched on both
left  (x  =  0)  and  right  (x  =  l)  ends  of  the  HSWS. The
charge distribution q(x, t) in the beam exciting electro-
magnetic  waves  in  the  transmission  line  was  deter-
mined  using  a  numerical  solution  of  the  problem
(described in detail in [7, 9]).

Since  oscillations  in  the  beam  with  a  VC  are  far
from being harmonic, the output radiation power of the
system under consideration can be expressed as

where  l  is  the  length  of  the  transmission  line  and  the
integral  implies  time  averaging  of  the  instantaneous
power Pm(t) = U2(t, l)/K at the right (exit) end of the
transmission line.

Figure 2a (dashed curve 2) shows a plot of the out-
put  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  power  P  versus  retarding
potential ∆Vr/V0, which was also calculated within the
framework  of  the  nonlinear  nonstationary  theory.  A
comparison of the experimental and theoretical curves
shows their good qualitative and quantitative agreement
at large values of the retarding potential (∆Vr/V0 > 0.4).
In this regime, the nonstationary one-dimensional the-
ory is valid, that is, the electron beam dynamics in a vir-
cator with large values of the retarding potential and the
focusing magnetic ﬁeld is close to one-dimensional.

However,  the  situation  changes  at  small  values  of
the retarding potential ∆Vr/V0: the experimental curve
in Fig. 2a shows that the power of generation gradually
decreases in the region of ∆Vr/V0 < 0.4 and vanishes at
∆Vr/V0 ≈ 0.18. Thus, oscillations in the beam with a VC
softly arise with increasing retardation, and the genera-
tion region extends over the range of ∆Vr/V0 ∈ [0.18,
0.72]. In contrast, the results of numerical simulation
are  indicative  of  a  sharp  breakage  of  oscillations  at
∆Vr/V0 ≈ 0.38. Accordingly, the region of existence of
the VC oscillations decreases, which is at variance with
the experimental data.

The  results  of  the  above  analysis  suggest  that  the
discrepancy  between  theory  and  experiment  in  the
region  of  small  retarding  potentials  is  related  to  the
neglect of two-dimensional motion of electrons in the
interaction  space. At  small  retarding  potentials  in  the
VC region, the beam dynamics becomes substantially
two-dimensional and there is a signiﬁcant current leak-
age to the HSWS, so that the one-dimensional model
fails to be applicable under such conditions [7].

 

Now let us brieﬂy consider the problem of determin-
ing  the  optimum  parameters  of  the  transmission  line,
for  which  the  microwave  radiation  power  extracted
from  the VC  region  reaches  a  maximum.  On  the  one
hand, an increase in the output power can be provided
by the increase in the resistance K of coupling between
the beam and the transmission line. However, the pos-
sibilities of signiﬁcantly increasing K are restricted, and
the experimental estimate (K = 100 Ω) is close to the
maximum possible value. Another possibility is offered
by a change in the phase velocity vph of the wave in the
transmission line. Figure 2b shows a plot of the output
power versus wave retardation expressed as n = vph/c,
where  c  is  the  velocity  of  light. As  can  be  seen  from
these data, the generation power P grows with decreas-
ing n and reaches a level of P ≈ 0.6–0.8 W at small n.
This behavior is probably related to the fact that the VC
oscillator,  in  contrast  to  the  systems  with  long-term
interaction  (such  as  traveling-wave  tubes  and  back-
ward-wave  oscillators),  do  not  obey  the  condition  of
synchronism between the wave and the electron ﬂow,
according  to  which  the  phase  velocity  of  the  electro-
magnetic  wave  must  be  close  to  the  velocity  of  elec-
trons in the beam [14]. Moreover, this synchronism is
in fact impossible in view of the signiﬁcant change in
the velocity of electrons in the retarding ﬁeld: from v0
(determined by the accelerating voltage V0 = 2 kV) to
zero  in  the  region  of  electron  stopping  and  reﬂection
(near  the  VC).  However,  it  should  be  noted  that  a
decrease in the retardation unavoidably leads to a cor-
responding  decrease  in  the  coupling  resistance  [15].
Therefore, a certain optimum design of the energy out-
put  probably  exists,  for  which  the  output  radiation
power is maximum.

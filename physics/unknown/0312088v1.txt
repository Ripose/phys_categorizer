Abstract 

 
1.  Short-term  earthquake  prediction  is  dubbed  the  (cid:147)Holy  Grail  of  earthquake  science.(cid:148)  Here, 
we  introduce  a  new  approach  to  this  problem,  based  on  the  concept  of  selforganization  of 
seismically  active  fault  network.  That  approach  is  named  (cid:147)Reverse  Detection  of  Precursors(cid:148) 
(RDP),  since  it  considers  precursors  in  reverse  order  of  their  appearance.  First,  we  detect  the 
(cid:147)candidates(cid:148)  for  the  short-term  precursors;  in  our  case  these  are  newly  introduced  chains  of 
earthquakes reflecting the rise of an earthquake correlation range. Then we consider each chain, 
one by one, checking whether it was preceded by an intermediate-term precursor in its vicinity. 
If yes, we regard this chain as a precursor; in prediction it would start a short-term alarm. Such 
analysis  has  an  essential  advantage:  the  chain  indicates  the  narrow  area  of  possibly  complex 
shape, where an intermediate-term precursor should be looked for. This makes possible to detect 
precursors undetectable by the direct analysis. 

2.  RDP  can  best  be  described  on  an  example  of  its  application;  we  describe  retrospective 
prediction of two prominent Californian earthquakes - Landers, 1992, M = 7.6, and Hector Mine, 
1999,  M  =  7.3,  and  suggest  a  hypothetical  prediction  algorithm.  However,  its  validation  is 
considered in subsequent studies, starting from (Shebalin et al, 2003a, b). The goal of this paper 
is  to  describe  RDP  methodology,  since  it  has  potentially  important  applications  to  many  other 
data  and  to  prediction  of  other  critical  phenomena  besides  earthquakes.  In  particular,  it  might 
vindicate some short-term precursors, previously rejected as giving many false alarms. 

3.  Validation  of  the  algorithm  per  se  requires  its  application  in  different  regions  with  a 
substantial  number  of  strong  earthquakes.  First  (and  positive)  results  are  obtained  for  21  more 
strong earthquakes in California (M ≥ 6.4), Japan (M ≥ 7.0) and the Eastern Mediterranean (M ≥ 
6.5); these results are described elsewhere. The final validation requires, as always, prediction in 
advance for which this study sets up a base. We have the first case of a precursory chain reported 
in advance of a subsequent strong earthquake (Tokachi-oki, near Hokkaido island, Japan) Sept. 
25, 2003, M = 8.1.

1.  Introduction 

 
Short-term  earthquake  prediction  is  dubbed  the  (cid:147)Holy  Grail  of  earthquake  science(cid:148)  in  the 
recent report of the US National Research Council (Jordan, 2003). It is indeed the most coveted 
and least accessible goal of earthquake prediction research. Here, we suggest a new approach to 
that  problem,  taking  advantage  of  a  fundamental  feature  of  seismicity  -  its  multi-scale 
selforganization. 
 

1.1.  Generation  of  strong  earthquakes  (cid:150)  a  non-localized  process.  Seismicity  is  commonly 
recognized as a part of the geodynamics (Aki, 2003; Bird, 1998; Keilis-Borok, 1990; King et al, 
2002;  Press,  1965;  Rundquist,  1999;  Scholz,  1990);  in  seismically  active  areas  the  earthquakes 
accommodate  a  considerable  fraction  of  tectonic  development  of  the  lithosphere.  That 
development  goes  on  in  multiple  time-,  space-,  and  energy-  scales  and  preparation  of  strong 
earthquakes is not an exception. Accordingly, while the target of earthquake prediction (cid:150) a strong 
earthquake (cid:150) is a localized event, the process of its generation is not localized. Strictly speaking, 
its  time  scales  range  from  geological  to  seconds  in  time,  and  spatial  scales  -  from  global  to 
microscopic  (Turcotte,  1997,  Keilis-Borok,  1990);  however,  in  prediction  research  a  truncated 
scaling is usually considered: from tens of years to days, and from hundreds of km to kilometer. 

The  multiplicity  of  scales  is  reflected  in  the  general  concept  of  the  seismically  active 
lithosphere as a hierarchical dissipative non-linear system, persistently self-organizing from time 
to time into the critical phenomena (cid:150) the strong earthquakes (Blanter et al, 1997, Bowman et al, 
1998;  Gabrielov  et  al,  1994,  2000;  Jaume  et  al,  1999;  Keilis-Borok,  1990;  Rundle  et  al,  2000; 
Sornette,  2000;  Turcotte,  1997;  Zaliapin  et  al,  2002a).  Among  manifestations  of  that 
selforganization are premonitory seismicity patterns (cid:150) the spatio-temporal patterns of seismicity 
emerging as a strong  earthquake approaches  (Aki, 2003; Buffe  et al, 1993; Caputo et al, 1983; 
Gabrielov et al, 1994; Jin et al, 2003; Keilis-Borok, 1990; 1996, 2000; Keilis-Borok et al, 1990a, 
b, 1964, 1999, 2002, Knopoff et al, 1996; Kossobokov et al, 1995, 2003; Ma et al, 1990; Mogi, 
1985; Newman et al, 1995; Novikova et al, 2002; Press, 1965; Press et al, 1995; Romanowicz, 
1993; Rotwain et al, 1999; Shebalin et al, 2000; Turcotte, 1997; Zaliapin et al, 2002a, b, 2003b; 
Z(cid:246)ller  et  al,  2001).  A  multitude  of  such  patterns  have  been  reported  in  rather  different  scales. 
Systematically tested are the intermediate-term patterns (with characteristic lead time of years). 
Here we suggest a method to detect the short-term patterns, which have the lead time of months.  
 

1.2.  Reverse  Detection  of  Precursors  (RDP).  We  consider  the  short-term  patterns  in 
conjunction with intermediate-term ones. This is done by RDP analysis, in which these patterns 
are  detected  in  the  reverse  order  of  their  appearance:  short-term  patterns  are  analyzed  first, 
although  they  emerge  later.  Our  findings  can  best  be  described  on  a  specific  example  of  data 
analysis.  
 

1.3.  Region  and  data.  We  describe  detection  of  short-term  patterns  before  two  prominent 
Californian earthquakes - Landers, 1992, M = 7.6, and Hector Mine, 1999, M = 7.3. These are 
the  largest  Californian  earthquakes  since  1965  (cid:150)  the  period,  when  the  earthquake  catalog  is 
sufficiently  complete  for  our  analysis.  Territory  considered  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  earthquake 
catalog is taken from (ANSS/CNSS and NEIC).

2. Chains 

 
Our  point  of  departure  is  provided  by  the  short-term  patterns  Roc  and  Accord  capturing  a 
premonitory  increase  in  earthquake  correlation  range.  They  were  found  first  in  models 
(Gabrielov et al, 2000) and then in observations (Keilis-Borok et al, 2002; Shebalin et al, 2000; 
Novikova et al, 2002). Other patterns capturing that phenomenon are suggested in (Z(cid:246)ller et al, 
2001; Zaliapin et al, 2002b). Here, we introduce the pattern Chain which is a generalization of 
Roc and Accord. Qualitatively, a chain is a rapidly extended sequence of small earthquakes that 
follow each other closely in time and space.  

 
2.1. Definitions. 
 
Earthquake  catalog.  As  in  most  premonitory  patterns  of  that  family  (Keilis-Borok,  1996; 
Kossobokov  et  al,  2003)  aftershocks  are  eliminated  from  the  catalog;  however,  an  integral 
measure of aftershocks sequence b is retained for each remaining earthquake (main shocks and 
foreshocks). We use a common representation of the earthquake catalog {tj, ϕj, λj, hj, mj , bj }, j = 
1,  2,  (cid:133)  Here tj  is  the  time  of  an  earthquake, tj  >=  tj-1;  ϕj  and λj  (cid:150)  latitude  and  longitude  of  its 
epicenter; hj (cid:150) focal depth; and mj (cid:150)magnitude. We consider the earthquakes with magnitude m ≥ 
mmin. Focal depth is not used in this study.  

 
Chain. Let us call two earthquakes (cid:147)neighbors(cid:148) if: (i) their epicenters lie within a distance r; 
and (ii) the time interval between them does not exceed a threshold τ 0. A chain is the sequence 
of  earthquakes  connected  by  the  following  rule:  each  earthquake  has  at  least  one  neighbor  in 
that sequence; and does not have neighbors outside the sequence. The threshold r is normalized 
by  the  average  distance  between  the  earthquakes  with  magnitudes  m  ≥  m,  where  m  is  the 
magnitude  of  the  smaller  earthquake  in  a  pair  considered.  We  use  a  coarse  normalization  r  = 
r010cm, c being a numerical parameter. 

Let k be the number of earthquakes thus connected and l - the maximal distance between their 
epicenters. We look for precursors only among the chains with k ≥ k0 and l ≥ l0. These thresholds 
ensure that our chains are exceptional phenomena. 

 
Chain(cid:146)s  vicinity.  To  compare  location  of  a  chain  with  locations  of  strong  earthquakes  we 
consider  its  R-vicinity  formally  defined  as  the  union  of  circles  of  the  radius  R  centered  at  the 
epicenters  of  in  the  chains  forming  the  chain.  To  smooth  the  borders  of  that  area  we  add  the 
dense  sequence  of  circles  along  the  lines  connecting  each  epicenter  in  the  chain  with  the  two 
closest ones. The envelope of all the circles is the border of R-vicinity of the chain; it is similar to 
the (cid:147)Wiener sausage(cid:148), introduced by N. Wiener in the theory of probability.  

 
2.2. Data analysis. We detected the chains defined above using numerical parameters listed in 
Table 1. Aftershocks have been identified by a coarse windowing, as described in (Keilis-Borok 
et al, 2002). The remaining catalog contains 3940 earthquakes. We have found among them nine 
chains, altogether containing 116 earthquakes: this shows that our chains are indeed exceptional 
phenomena.  Maps  of  the  chains  are  shown  in  Fig.  2;  shaded  areas  are  their  vicinities,  defined 
above. Vital characteristics of each chain are given in Table 2. Fig. 3 juxtaposes the chains and 
strong earthquakes on the time-distance plane; distance is counted along the dashed line shown 
in Figs. 1 and 2.

Chains  recognized  as  (cid:147)precursory(cid:148)  by  RDP  analysis  (Sect.  3)  are  shown  in  bold.  Chain  #4 

would trigger in prediction a false alarm, chains ##8 and 9 would trigger correct alarms. 

 
As we see in Figs. 2 (two panels in the bottom row) and Fig. 3, only the two last chains (## 8, 
9)  might  be  regarded  as  the  local  short  -  time  precursors  to  the  Landers  and  Hector  Mine 
earthquakes:  short-term  -  because  they  emerge  with  the  short-term  lead  times  (respectively  1.7 
and 4.6 months); and local (cid:150) because the target  earthquakes occur in their vicinities. However, 
the other seven chains, if used as precursors, would give false alarms. To reduce their number we 
introduce the RDP analysis. 

 
 
3. Precursory chains. 

 
3.1. Hypothesis. We hypothesize that a precursory chain (as opposed to a chain giving a false 
alarm)  is  preceded  by  the  local  intermediate-term  precursors  formed  in  the  chain(cid:146)s  R-vicinity. 
This vicinity is not known, until the chain is formed, and its shape might be rather complicated 
(see  Fig.  2).  To  overcome  that  impasse  we  introduce  the  two-step  RDP  analysis  schematically 
illustrated in Fig. 4.  

(i)  Search  for  the  chains  and  determination  of  their  R  vicinities  (Sect.  2).  Each  chain  is 

regarded as a (cid:147)candidate(cid:148) for a short-term precursor.  

 

4

(ii) Search for the local intermediate-term patterns in the R-vicinities of each chain. They are 
looked for within T years before the chain; T is an adjustable numerical parameter. If (and only 
if)  such  patterns  are  detected,  we  regard  this  chain  as  a  short-term  precursor;  in  prediction  it 
would start a short-term alarm.  

To complete that description we have to specify intermediate-term patterns used at the second 

step. 
 
3.2. Definitions. We use the pattern Σ which reflects premonitory rise of seismic activity. This 
pattern,  introduced  in  (Keilis-Borok  et  al,  1964),  is  successfully  used  in  different  prediction 
algorithms, alone or in combination with other patterns (Keilis-Borok, 1990, 1996, 2000; Keilis-
Borok et al, 1999, 2002; Kossobokov et al, 1995, 2003; Rotwain et al, 1999). It is defined as a 
premonitory  increase  of  the  total  area  of  the  earthquake  sources.  Emergence  of  this  pattern  is 
captured by the function Σ(t) defined in a sliding time-window (Keilis-Borok et al, 1964): 

 

Σ(t/s,B) =∑

i

Bmi

10

, mi ≥ mmin ;  t (cid:150) s < ti ≤ t 

Summation is taken over all main shocks within the time window (t-s, t) in the R-vicinity of the 
chain. We take B ∼ 1, so that the sum is coarsely proportional to the total area of the fault breaks 
in  the  earthquakes(cid:146)  sources  (Keilis-Borok,  2002);  with  B=0  this  sum  is  the  number  of 
earthquakes, with B = 3/2 it is proportional to their total energy. The emergence of pattern Σ is 
identified by condition Σ(t) ≥ Σ0; this threshold depends on the magnitude of target earthquakes. 
In  previous  applications  cited  above  pattern  Σ  was  used  as  non-local  one.  We  renormalize  its 
numerical parameters to make it local. 

 
3.3. Data analysis. We detected precursory chains and determined their R-vicinities (Sect. 2). 
In each vicinity we computed the function Σ(t) within time interval T = 5 years and summation 
interval s = 6 months. We identified as precursory three chains preceded by largest peaks of Σ(t); 
they can be recognized with the threshold Σ0 = 106.7. Table 2 shows these chains in bold. As we 
see, identification of the first chain, in 1977, is wrong; in prediction it would give a false alarm. 
Identification of two other chains, in 1992 and 1999, is correct; each is followed by a target 
earthquake within few months. The same chains would the selected with the tenfold smaller time 
interval, T = 6 months. The corresponding threshold is Σ0 = 105.4; its value is smaller since 
smaller number of earthquakes is included in summation.  

 
3.4. Hypothetical prediction algorithm. It remains to define alarms triggered by that 

precursor. This is a final step in transition from a precursor to algorithmic prediction. We adapt 
the standard general scheme of prediction algorithms, widely used in intermediate-term 
earthquakes prediction and many other problems (Keilis-Borok, 2002; Kossobokov et al, 1995, 
and references therein):  

 
(i) Prediction is targeted at the main shocks with magnitude M or more; usually the magnitude 
intervals (M, M+1) are considered separately.  
 
(ii)  When  a  precursory  chain  is  detected,  a  short-term  alarm  is  triggered.  It  predicts  a  target 
earthquake  in  R-vicinity  of  the  chain,  within  time  interval  (te,  te  +  τ);  here  te  is  the  moment 

 

5

when  chain  emerged,  τ  is  a  numerical  parameter  (duration  of  alarm).  Results  of  the  data 
analysis suggest to take τ = 6 months. 
 
Possible  outcomes  of  such  prediction  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  5.  Probabilistic  component  of 
prediction  is  represented  by  the  total  time-space  covered  by  alarms  and  probabilities  of  false 
alarms and failures to predict (Molchan, 2003). 

 

 
4. Discussion. 
 
4.1.  Summary.  This  paper  introduces  RDP  analysis  in  the  study  of  selforganization  of 
seismicity,  culminated  by  a  strong  earthquake.  Precursors  with  different  lead  times  are 
considered  in  reverse  order  of  their  appearance.  First  we  detect  the  candidates  for  short  (cid:150)term 
precursors; in our case those are the chains of small earthquakes capturing the rise of earthquake 
correlation  range.  A  chain  determines  its  narrow  vicinity  where  we  look  for  the  local 
intermediate  (cid:150)  term  precursor(s),  pattern  Σ  in  our  case.  Its  presence  in  turn  indicates  the 
precursory  chains.  We  describe  RDP  with  detecting  precursory  chains  months  before  two 
prominent  California  earthquakes,  Landers,  1992  and  Hector  Mine,  1999,  well  isolated  in  time 
and space from other comparable earthquakes in that region.  

 
4.2.  Methodological  advantage  of  RDP.  The  opposite  (direct)  analysis  would  start  with 
detection  of  the  intermediate-term  patterns  hidden  in  the  background  seismicity.  Almost  all  of 
them, known so far, are not local, pattern Σ included. They emerge in the areas whose linear size 
is up to 10 times larger than the source of the incipient target earthquake (Bowman et al, 1998; 
Keilis-Borok  et  al,  2003);  some  patterns  -  even  up  to  100  times  larger  (Press  et  al,  1995; 
Romanowicz, 1993). We have found here renormalized pattern Σ that became local: it emerges 
in the same narrow area (R-vicinity of the chain), where epicenter of a target earthquake lies. As 
we see in Fig. 2, the shape of that area might be rather complex, and its size - diverse. To find 
this area by trying different shapes, sizes, and locations is not realistic. Reverse analysis resolves 
this impasse, indicating a limited number of chains to consider. 

 
4.3. Physical interpretation. RDP seems to be a promising general approach to prediction of 
critical transitions in non-linear systems: it identifies a rare small-scale phenomenon that carries 
a memory of the larger scale history of the system. At the same time this approach has a natural 
earth-specific  explanation:  it  follows  from  the  concept  that  strong  earthquake  is  a  result  of  a 
lasting  large-scale  process  whose  different  stages  involve  different  parts  of  the  fault  network. 
Earthquakes  in  the  chain  mark  the  part  of  the  fault  network  that  has  started  to  move  in  unison 
months  before  a  target  earthquake.  Pattern  Σ  indicates  that  this  synchronization  started  much 
earlier,  albeit  expressed  in  a  more  subtle  form.  A  similar  step-by-step  escalation  of  instability 
was observed in direct analysis: by algorithms M8&MSc (Kossobokov et al, 2003), and by some 
other algorithms (Aki, 2003; Shebalin et al, 2000; Keilis-Borok et al, 2003). 

Both  the  chains  and  the  peaks  of  Σ  are  sporadic  short-lived  phenomena  not  necessarily 
reflecting  the  steady  trends  of  seismicity.  This  is  typical  for  all  premonitory  patterns  of  that 
family (Keilis-Borok, 2002; Kossobokov et al, 2003). Probably, both patterns are the symptoms 
but  not  causes  of  a  strong  earthquake:  they  signal  its  approach  but  do  not  trigger  it.  Similarly 

 

6

sporadic  are  many  observed  precursors  to  other  critical  phenomena,  e.g.  economic  recessions 
(Keilis-Borok et al, 2000). 

 
4.4. Implications for earthquake prediction.  
-- RDP analysis seems worth exploring further on a larger set of target earthquakes. So far it 
was explored in the following regions: Southern and Central California, 1965-2003, with 9 target 
earthquakes, M ≥ 6.4.; Japan, 1975-2003, with 12 target earthquakes, M ≥ 7.0; and the Eastern 
Mediterranean,  1980-2003,  with  2  target  earthquakes,  M  =  7.3  and  6.9.  For  each  region 
numerical  parameters  have  been  renormalized  to  corresponding  magnitude  thresholds;  and  all 
major  types  of  intermediate-term  patterns  have  been  considered.  The  results  are  highly 
encouraging  (Jin  et  al,  2003;  Shebalin  et  al,  2003a,  b):  they  are  described  in  more  detail  in 
(Shebalin et al, 2003b). In Southern and Central California only one of nine target earthquakes is 
missed  by  prediction,  with  two  false  alarms.  In  Japan  one  of  12  target  earthquakes  is  missed, 
with seven false alarms; in the Eastern Mediterranean neither target earthquake is missed, with 
no false alarms.  

--  We  have  the  first  case  of  advance  prediction:  precursory  chain  reported  in  advance  of  a 
subsequent  Tokachi-oki  earthquake  near  Hokkaido  island,  Japan  (Sept.  25,  2003,  M  =  8.1) 
(Shebalin et. al, 2003a, b). 

-- (cid:147)Pre-chain(cid:148) precursors might emerge with a short lead time too.  
--  It  seems  natural  to  apply  the  RDP  analysis  to  earthquake  precursors,  expressed  in  other 
fields. First positive results are obtained with precursors gauging interaction between the ductile 
and brittle layers of the crust (Aki, 2003; Jin et al, 2003; Shebalin et al, 2003a). Other promising 
applications  include  electromagnetic  fields  (Uyeda  et  al,  2002),  fluid  regime  (Keilis-Borok, 
1990; Ma et al, 1990), GPS, InSAR, etc. 

--  There  are  no  reasons  not  to  explore  RDP  analysis  for  prediction  of  critical  phenomena  in 
other  hierarchical  systems,  geotechnical,  and  even  soci-economic  ones.  Similar  qualitative 
approach is routinely used in medicine, criminology, etc.  

-- We detect intermediate-term patterns only after a chain has emerged so that its vicinity can 
be  determined;  this  is  too  late  to  declare  an  intermediate-term  alarm.  Accordingly,  our  results 
concern only short-term prediction.  

--  However  accurate  the  short-term  prediction  would  be  it  will  not  render  unnecessary  the 
predictions  with  a  longer  lead  time.  One  can  find  in  seismological  literature  a  reappearing 
mistake:  that  only  short-term  prediction  is  practically  useful.  Actually,  protection  from 
earthquakes requires a hierarchy of preparedness measures, from building codes, insurance, and 
issuing  bonds,  to  reinforcement  of  high  risk  objects,  to  red  alert.  It  takes  different  time,  from 
decades,  to  years,  to  seconds  to  undertake  different  measures.  Accordingly,  while  short-term 
prediction is currently the most challenging part of prediction research, earthquake preparedness 
requires all stages of prediction (Keilis-Borok, 2002; Molchan, 2003; Kantorovich et al, 1991). 
Such is the case in preparedness to all disasters, war included. 

 
4.5. Questions arising. 
--  We  considered  only  one  short-term  precursor  (cid:150)  a  chain  of  earthquakes  -  and  one 
intermediate-term  one  -  the  pattern  Σ.  In  subsequent  applications  (Shebalin  et  al,  2003b),  all 
intermediate-term  seismicity  patterns  have  been  used  with  similar 
major 
renormalization.  The  question  arises  which  set  of  precursors  provides  the  optimal  prediction 
strategy, as defined for example in (Molchan, 2003; Zaliapin et al, 2003b) 

types  of

--  It  is  not  yet  clear  how  to  make  the  scaling  of  RDP  analysis  self-adapting  to  the  regional 

seismic regime, e. g. to parameters of the Gutenberg-Richter relation. 

-- Earthquake precursors emerge with the broader range of the lead times than considered here. 
They are divided, albeit fuzzily, into long- term (tens of years) ⇒ intermediate-term (years) ⇒ 
short-term  (months)  and ⇒  immediate  (days  or  less).  The  question  arises  how  to  apply  RDP 
analysis to the whole sequence or to its different parts. 
 

Summing up, the RDP approach seems to open new possibilities in the quest for the short-term 
prediction  (cid:150)  (cid:147)the  Holy  Grail  of  the  earthquake  science(cid:148)  according  to  the  US  National  Reseach 
Council (Jordan, 2003).  We hope that this study  sets up a base for further development of this 
approach  in  the  intertwined  problems  of  earthquake  prediction,  fundamental  understanding 
dynamics of the lithosphere, and non-linear dynamics.

Fig. 1. Territory considered.  
Stars mark large earthquakes, targeted for prediction. Dots show background seismicity for the 
time considered (1965-2003): epicenters of earthquakes with magnitude m ≥ 3 with aftershocks 
eliminated. Dashed line is used for time-distance projection of epicenters shown in Fig. 3 below.  

 
Fig. 2. Maps of the chains.  
Detected  chains  are  shown  in  separate  boxes.  Circles  show  epicenters  of  earthquakes  in  a 
chain;  their  size  is  proportional  to  magnitude.  The  shadowed  areas  show  R-vicinities  of  the 
chains. Dates of the beginning and of the end of a chain are given at the top of each box. Three 
chains (1977, 1992, and  1999) shown in bold are identified as precursory ones. The first chain 
gives  a  false  alarm;  two  other  chains  are  followed  within  few  months  by  target  earthquakes, 
Landers and Hector Mine. Other notations are the same as in Fig.1. 

 
Fig. 3. Chains and strong earthquakes on the time-distance plain.  
Distance  is  counted  along  the  dashed  line  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Filled  and  open  circles  show  the 
chains  identified  respectively  as  precursory  and  non-precursory  ones.  Other  notations  are  the 
same as in Fig. 1. 

 
Fig. 4. Schematic illustration of the Reverse Detection of Precursors (RDP). 
Star  is  a  target  earthquake.  Light  blue  circles  show  earthquakes  forming  the  chain.  The 
rectangle shows symbolically the  (cid:147)R-vicinity(cid:148) of the chain (the (cid:147)N. Wiener sausage(cid:148)).  It is the 
time-space where pattern Σ is looked for; its presence indicates a precursory chain. Rectangle on 
the top shows the map of the chain (yellow) and the source of target earthquake (red). The chains 
are detected first, although they emerge after the pattern Σ. Note how a narrow chain determines 
a  much  larger  time  interval  where  a  pattern  Σ  is  looked  for.  Pink  area  shows  the  time-space 
covered by an alarm: within τ months after precursory chain a target earthquake is expected in its 
R-vicinity.  

 
Fig. 5. Possible outcomes of prediction. Stars mark epicenters of strong earthquakes, targeted 
by prediction. A box represents the time - space covered by an alarm. A prediction is correct if a 
strong earthquake occurs within an alarm. Otherwise, this is a false alarm. Failure to predict is 
the  case  when  a  strong  earthquake  occurs  outside  of  an  alarm.  Probabilistic  component  of 
prediction  is  represented  by  the  total  time-space  covered  by  alarms  and  probabilities  of  false 
alarms and failures to predict.

Immersion Anomaly of Dirac Operator on Surface in R3

Shigeki MATSUTANI
2-4-11 Sairenji, Niihama, Ehime, 792 Japan

Abstract

In previous report (J. Phys. A (1997) 30 4019-4029), I showed that the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned in
a surface immersed in R3 by means of a mass type potential is governed by the Konopelchenko-
Kenmotsu-Weierstrass-Enneper equation. In this article, I quantized the Dirac ﬁeld and calculated
the gauge transformation which exhibits the gauge freedom of the parameterization of the surface.
Then using the Ward-Takahashi identity, I showed that the expectation value of the action of the
Dirac ﬁeld is expressed by the Willmore functional and area of the surface.

In the previous report [1], I showed that the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned in a thin curved surface S
immersed in three dimensional ﬂat space R3 obeys the Dirac equation which is discovered by
Konopelchenko [2-4]

H is the mean curvature of the surface S parameterized by complex z and ρ is the factor of the
conformal metric induced from R3.

This equation completely represents the immersed geometry as the old Weierstrass-Enneper equa-

tion expresses the minimal surface [2].

Even though the relation had been essentially found by Kenmotsu [4-7], the formulation as the
Dirac type was performed by Konopelchenko and recently it is revealed that the Dirac operator has
more physical and mathematical meanings; the Dirac operator is a translator between the geometrical
and analytical objects [8] even in the arithmetic geometry of the number theory [9]. Thus although
the Dirac type equation (1-1) has been called as the generalized Weierstrass equation, in this article
I will call it Konopelchenko-Kenmotsu-Weierstrass-Enneper (KKWE) equation.

The immersion geometry is currently studied in the various ﬁelds, e.g., soliton theory, the dif-
ferential geometry, the harmonic map theory, string theory and so on. In the soliton theory, the
question what is the integrable is the most important theme and one of its answers might be found
in the immersed geometry. In fact, the static sine-Gordon equation was discovered by Euler, from
the energy functional of the elastica given by Daniel Bernoulli in eighteenth century, as an elastica
immersed in R2 [10] and the net sine-Gordon equation was found in the last century as a surface
immersed in R3 [11]. Recently Goldstein and Petrich discovered the modiﬁed KdV (MKdV) hierar-
chy by considering one parameter deformation of a space curve immersed in R2 [12,13]. After their
new interpretation, there appear several geometrical realizations of the soliton theory [14-16]. In the
diﬀerential geometry, after the discovery the exotic solution of the constant mean curvature surface
by Wente [17], the extrinsic structure is currently studied again [18-20]. In the harmonic map theory,
it is found that the minimal point of a functional is, sometimes, integrable and classiﬁed by the

2

extrinsic topology [20] like the elastica problem [21], a prototype of such model which ﬁrstly entered
in history [10].

Furthermore Polyakov introduced an extrinsic action in the string theory and the theory of 2-
dimensional gravity for renomalizability [22]. His program has been studied in the framework of
W-algebra [23] but recently was investigated by Carroll and Konopelchenko [24] and Viswanathan
and Parthasarathy [25] using more direct method. Polyakov’s extrinsic action in the classical level
is the same as the Willmore functional [26,27],

W =

dvol H 2,

(1-3)

ZS
where ”dvol” is a volume form of the surface S.

Accordingly the immersed surface is a very current object and its studies currently progress.
On the other hand I have been studying the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned in an immersed object and its
relationship with the immersed object itself [28-32]. Since the Dirac operator should be regarded
as a translator (a functor) between the analytical object and the geometrical object [8-9], in terms
of the Dirac operator, I have been studying the physical and geometrical meanings of the abstract
theorems in the soliton theory and quantum theory focusing on the elastica problem [28-32] and
recently on the immersed surface [1].

In this article, I will deal with the quantized Dirac ﬁeld and investigate the gauge freedom which
does not change the Willmore functional. In other words, I will search for a symmetry in the classical
level and compute its anomalous relation in quantum level using Fujikawa type prescription [33-35].
Furthermore since there are negative eigenvalues which makes the theory worse in a calculus, I will
propose new regularization which can be regarded as a local version of a generalization of Hurwitz
ζ-function [36] and then I will obtain the ﬁnite result and the coupling constant of the Liouville action
[22] as convergent parameter. Finally I have the relation between the expectation value of the action
of the Dirac ﬁeld and the Willmore functional. It reminds me of the boson-fermion correspondence
in this system. It should be noted that even though it does not directly generate topological index,
it could be regarded as a local version of the Atiyah-Singer type index theorem [8,9,37-39].

Organization of this article is as follows. Section 2 reviews the extrinsic geometry of a surface
immersed in R3. There I will introduce the Willmore surface as a free energy of a thin elastic surface.
In section 3, starting with the quantized Dirac ﬁeld whose on-shell equation is KKWE equation (1-1),
I will calculate the variation of a gauge transformation. Using the Ward-Takahashi identity, I will
obtain an anomalous relation exhibiting this system. In section 4, I will discuss the obtained results.

as a shape of a thin elastic surface. Its local free energy density
is given as an invariant for the local coordinate transformation. On the other hand, the diﬀerence
of the local surface densities between inside and outside surfaces is proportional to the extrinsic
curvature due to its thickness, for a local deformation of the surface. By the linear response of the
elastic body theory and independence of the coordinate transformation, the free energy might be
given as [40]

where χ is the Euler characteristic, which is an integer and exhibits the global topological properties
of the surface. Hence the second term in (2-16) is not dynamical one if one ﬁxes the topology of the
system.

Hence the free energy of the system becomes

This functional integral is known as the Willmore functional [26,27] and, recently, as the Polyakov’s
extrinsic action in the 2-dimensional gravity [22,24,25]. For later convenience, I will ﬁx B0 = 1 and
introduce a quantity [1-4],

3. Immersion Anomaly
§

In the previous report [1], I showed that the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned in the surface

obeys the KKWE
equation (1-1). In this article, I will deal with the quantized fermion over the immersed surfaces.
As I did in ref.[29], after I quantize the Dirac ﬁeld, I can obtain the quantized Dirac ﬁeld over the
by conﬁning it using the conﬁnement mass-type potential. This computation
immersed thin surface
can be performed parallelled to the arguments in refs. [1] and [29]. Thus in this article, I will start
with the quantized Dirac ﬁeld of the surface
[1,22,41]. The partition function of the Dirac ﬁeld is
given as,

The Willmore functional (2-20) is expressed by p and p consists of multiple of H and √ρ. Hence
by ﬁxing p, there still remains a freedom of choice of ρ; ﬁxing p means the deformation of ρ without
changing the Willmore functional. Corresponding to the deformation preserving the value of the
Willmore functional, the lagrangian of the Dirac ﬁeld (3-2) has a similar gauge freedom which does
not change the action SDirac. In fact using such the gauge freedom, I scaled the Dirac ﬁeld ψψψ to f in
(3-8).

However in the quantum ﬁeld theory, even though the lagrangian is invariant for a transformation,
the partition function is not in general due to the jacobian of the functional measure. The purpose
of this article is to calculate this quantum eﬀect. Thus I will estimate the inﬁnitesimal gauge
transformation which does not change the action of the Dirac ﬁeld (3-2) and is an analogue of the
transformation of (3-8).

Following a conventional notation, I will introduce the dilatation parameter,

which is sometimes called as dilaton [22]. Furthermore I will rewrite the Dirac operator in (3-6) as,

§

The right hand side of (3-38) is closely related to the conformal anomaly in the string theory
and the Liouville action. If H vanishes, the arguments in the previous section can be parallelled to
the calculation of the conformal anomaly [22]. The case H = 0 is known as the minimal surface in
the immersion geometry [2,11,27]. Thus the quantity µ2 introduced in (3-31) is identiﬁed with the
coupling constant of the dilaton in the Liouville action [22]. This picture preserves in the region with
the ﬁnite constant curvature H and then the physical meaning of µ2 is clariﬁed.

Furthermore it should be noted that if I employ the heat kernel regularization instead of the
modiﬁed negative power regularization, µ2 appears as inﬁnite value, µ2
1/τ . Thus mathematically
µ2 is interpreted as a convergence parameter which makes the kernel ﬁnite and this picture consists
with the motivation to make the integral in (3-28) well-deﬁned.

Even though the current is not conserved, B2ν is expected as a topological quantity. Thus (4-5)
means that the expectation value of the action of the Dirac operator is written as the Willmore
functional and the area of the surface. If the mean curvature vanishes, the minimal of area of the
surface corresponds to stationary point of the action of the Dirac operator. This correspondence is
theorem of the minimal surface and of old Weierstrass-Enneper equation [11]. For general immersion,
investigation on the Dirac operator of the KKWE equation (3-9) means studying the Willmore surface
itself if ﬁxing the area. On the case of Schr¨odinger particle, the immersion eﬀect appears as attractive
potential and thus the sign of the Willmore action can be naturally interpreted [43]. Furthermore,
since the Liouville action can be extended to that with supersymmetry [22], I believe that this
correspondence (4-5) between these actions should be interpreted by supersymmetry of this system.
The Willmore surface problem of R3 has very similar structure of the elastica problem of R2.
Corresponding to the Willmore functional (2-20), there is Euler-Bernoulli functional for an elastica
[10,21],

E =

dq1 k2,

Z

(4-6)

where k is a curvature of the elastica [10,19]. While the Willmore surface is related to the modiﬁed
Novikov-Veselov (MNV) equation, the elastica is related to the modiﬁed KdV equation. From the
soliton theory, the MNV equation is a higher dimensional analogue of the MKdV equation [6]. The
Dirac operator appearing in the auxiliary linear problems of the MKdV equation is realized as the
operator for the Dirac ﬁeld conﬁned in the elastica [28-32] as the KKWE equation might be related
to auxiliary linear problems of the MNV equation [2,6] and is realized as the equation of the Dirac
ﬁeld conﬁned in the immersed surface [1].

In the series of works [28-32], I have been studying the elastica in terms of the quantized Dirac
ﬁelds in the elastica. In terms of the partition function of the Dirac ﬁeld, I constructed the Jimbo-
Miwa theory of the MKdV hierarchy [32] and showed the physical meaning of the inverse scattering
method and the monodromy preserving deformation [28,31]. Investigation on the Dirac operator of
the KKWE equation might lead us to the Sato-type theory of the MNV hierarchy.

Furthermore, recently I exactly quantized the elastica of the Euler-Bernoulli functional (4-6)
preserving its local length and found that its moduli is closely related to the two-dimensional quantum
gravity; the quantized elastica obeys the MKdV hierarchy and at a critical point, the Painlev´e
equation of the ﬁrst kind appears [21]. Instead of the local length preserving, after imposing that
the surface preserves its complex structure or other constraints e.g. ρH =constant [24,25], one could
quantize the Willmore functional and then, I expect that the MNV hierarchy might appear [44] as
the quantized motion of a Willmore surface in the path integral as the MKdV hierarchy appears in
the quantization of the elastica [21].

Moreover recently another relation between the geometry and quantum equation, was discovered
by Konopelchenko [45-47]. At this stage, I could not physically interpret the new relation but
believe that there is another quantum meanings. I expect that his old and new relations [2-4,44-46]
are clariﬁed in the quantum mechanical context.

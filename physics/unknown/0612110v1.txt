We have  observed that the collisional frequency  shift in primary caesium fountain clocks 

varies with the clock state population composition and, in particular, is zero for a given fraction 
of the |F = 4, mF = 0〉 atoms, depending on the initial cloud parameters. We present a theoretical 

model explaining our observations. The possibility  of the collisional shift cancellation implies 

an improvement in the performance of caesium fountain standards and a simplification in their 
operation. Our results also have implications for test operation of fountains at multiple π/2 pulse 

areas. 

The primary caesium clocks have increased their accuracy and stability by an order of magnitude over the last 

decade [1]. This staggering progress has mainly resulted from the implementations of laser cooling and the fountain 
configuration. Slow atoms allow for long interrogation times and observation of narrow resonances (≤ 1 Hz) leading 

to  improvements  in  the  short-term  stability.  At  the  same  time  many  systematic  effects,  which  limited  the 

performance of thermal beam clocks, have been significantly reduced in the fountains resulting in improvements of 

their  accuracy.  The  use  of  ultracold  atoms  gave  rise,  however,  to  a  frequency  shift  due  to  collisions,  an  effect 

generally neglected in thermal beam clocks. For the several operational fountain frequency standards, the collisions 

constitute one of the major systematic effects limiting the standards’ performance.  

Generally, the fountain standards are corrected for the collisional frequency shift by extrapolating the measured 

frequency  to  zero  atom  density,  assuming  a  linear  dependence  between  the  shift  and  the  density.  However,  the 

atomic density is not measured directly in the fountains. The changes in the density are derived from changes in the 

number Nat of detected atoms. A potential deviation from linearity between Nat and the atomic density (and hence 

the  shift)  gives  rise  to  an  uncertainty  of  the  correction.  One  way  to  minimize  this  uncertainty  is  to  operate  the 

fountain at a very low density [2]. Unfortunately, with a low atom number the detection signal-to-noise ratio (and 

short-term stability of the standard) is reduced. Another way relies on the implementation of a technique based on 

adiabatic passage to link unambiguously changes in density with changes in Nat [3]. In this case, the accuracy of the 
collisional shift measurement is ultimately limited by a residual amount of atoms in |F = 3, mF ≠ 0〉 colliding with 

atoms in the clock states during the ballistic flight [4]. 

Ways  of  cancelling  the  collisional  shift  have  been  studied  earlier.  The  cancellation  would  be  possible  if  the 

cross-sections  of  the  frequency  changing  collisions  of  the  two  clock  states  |3,0〉  and  |4,0〉  were  of  opposite  sign. 

Then, if a certain composition of the clock states were excited the two contributions to the clock shift would cancel. 

In  the  1990s  the  relevant  cross-sections  for  various  Cs  isotopes  were  calculated  and  it  was  shown  that  the 

 

1 

cancellation  is  possible  for  radioactive  isotopes  135Cs  and  137Cs,  but  not  for  133Cs,  which  is  used  to  realise  the  SI 

second  [5].  Also  in  an  earlier  experiment  no  significant  difference  between  the  collisional  shift  for  balanced  and 

imbalanced populations of the clock states was found [6]. The calculations in Ref. [5] were based on a theoretical 

model  developed  in  Ref.  [7],  predicting  the  Wigner  threshold  regime  in  Cs  for  microkelvin  temperatures.  More 

recently,  as  more  accurate  constraints  for  the  Cs-Cs  scattering  parameters  were  given  by  experiments  [8],  new 

calculations  were  performed  [9].  It  was  found  that  the  Wigner  threshold  regime  is  reached  only  for  temperatures 

(collision energies) below 0.1 nK. Thus, unlike previously assumed, the collision rate (and clock shift) does depend 

on  the  energy  of  the  colliding  atoms.  The  variation  of  the  collisional  shift  with  the  clock  state  composition  was 
predicted for temperatures below 0.2 μK. 

In this paper, we present updated theoretical calculations of the collision rate coefficients and show that the sub-
microkelvin  temperatures  are  effectively  reached  in  caesium  fountains,  if  the  atoms  are  launched  at  a  μK 

temperature  and  in  a  small  initial  cloud  (e-1/2  radius  σ0, where  typically  σ0  <  1  mm),  e.g.  when  released  from  a 

magneto-optical trap (MOT). We then report on an experimental demonstration, in two independent systems, of the 

strong variation of the collisional shift as a function of the clock state composition and the cancellation of the shift 

for  a  particular  ratio  of  the  populations.  We  also  discuss  the  implications  of  this  effect  for  the  operation  and 

performance of caesium fountain clocks. 

We  have  performed  a  calculation  of  the  clock  shift,  the  collision-induced  shift  in  the  transition  frequency 

between the two clock states, based on the description of Refs. [10, 11].  In essence, the energy levels of an atom are 

shifted due to collisions or interactions with other atoms. The differential level shift of the two  clock states is the 

clock  shift. The  atom-atom  interaction,  to  good  approximation,  is  determined  by  the  interplay  between two  Born-

Oppenheimer potentials, which describe the electronic bonding between ground-state caesium atoms, the rotation of 

the di-atom, and the hyperfine interaction of each atom. As the depth of the Born-Oppenheimer potentials is orders 

of magnitude larger than the collision energies and the spatial extent of the Born-Oppenheimer potentials is much 

smaller  than  the  mean  distance  between  the  caesium  atoms  the  clock  shift  is  expressible  in  terms  of  scattering 

amplitudes or S matrices that depend on relative collision energy E, relative orbital angular momentum, as well as 

the  hyperfine  states  of  the  colliding  atoms.  Only  in  the  Wigner  threshold  regime  can  a  simplified  as  well  as 

insightful expression be used [12].   

Within  the  theory  of  [10,  11]  the  clock  shift  due  to  collisions  at  a  single  collision  energy  E  is  given

scattering amplitudes. We assume that in the experiment only the states i = |3,0〉 and |4,0〉 are populated (ρ30  + ρ40 = 

Figure  1  shows  our  theoretical  results  for  the  collision  rate  coefficients  λ30(E)  and  λ40(E)  as  a  function  of 

collision  energy  E.  The  results  are  based  on  the  Born-Oppenheimer  potentials  of  Ref.  [13],  and  a  close-coupled 

calculation of the scattering amplitudes. Most notable is that the energy dependence of the two rate coefficients is 
very  different.  The  rate  coefficient  λ30(E)  changes  sign  at  E/kB  =  0.16  μK  while  λ40(E)  is  always  negative.  By

In  the  experiment  we  have  a  distribution  of  collision  energies,  which  evolves  during  the  ballistic  flight.  We 
must modify Δω(E) to include an average over the spatial and velocity density n(x,v,t) of the spreading atom cloud

 is the number of colliding atoms, and time t satisfies tup < t < tdown (tup and tdown are the instants of 

passage  through  the  Ramsey  cavity,  respectively,  and  t  =  0  is  the  launch  time).  Our  observed  clock  shift  is  the 
instantaneous clock shift Δω(t) averaged over the time the atoms spend between the two microwave interactions at  

tup  and  tdown  (Ramsey  time).  We  calculated  the  clock  shift  by  performing  3D  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  the 

expanding cloud [14]. 

The collision energies during the Ramsey time may  be significantly lower than those derived from the launch 
temperature,  typically  1-2  μK.  The  low  collision  energies  result  from  a  purely  kinetic  effect,  position-velocity 

correlations,  which  develop  in  the  expanding  atomic  cloud  [15,  16].  As  the  cloud  expands,  collisions  are  only 
possible  for  the  atoms  with  small  relative  velocities  vcoll  <  σ0/t.  In  order  to  gain  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the 

collision  energies,  we  computed  a  local  collision  energy,  defined  as  an  average  kinetic  energy  of  atoms  in  a 

neighbourhood  of  a  given  atom  in  its reference  frame. The  local  energy  value  does  not  depend  on the  size  of  the 

chosen  neighbourhood,  as  long  as  it  is  smaller than the  initial  cloud  size.  Fig.  2  shows  the  evolution  of  the  local 
energy for various launch temperatures T0 and two initial cloud sizes σ0. The initial sizes σ0 = 5 mm and σ0 = 1 mm 

correspond to situations when atoms are collected in an optical molasses or in a MOT, respectively. While the local 

energy decreases in both cases, the decrease is almost an order of magnitude larger for the small initial cloud. We 

further  consider  only  small initial  clouds,  which  are relevant  to  our  experimental  conditions.  We  note  that, as  the 

atomic density in the expanding cloud also decreases rapidly during the flight in the fountain, the collisions taking 

place during the first part of the Ramsey time have the prevailing effect on the frequency shift [14, 16].  

For T0 = 1 μK, σ0 < 1 mm and t > tup the collision energies divided by the Boltzmann constant are less than 300 
nK. For these collision energies the rate coefficients λ30 and λ40 differ in sign (Fig. 1), which gives rise to a strong 

variation  of  the  collisional  clock  shift  if  the  composition  of  the  clock  states  (after the  first  Ramsey  interaction) is 

varied. In the inset to Fig. 3 we show the variable shift calculated for parameters similar to those met in experiment 

(assuming spherical symmetry of the atom cloud). Of particular interest is the composition for which the collisional 
shift  is  zero  (ρ40
(C)).  We  note  that  the  collisional  shift  cancellation  occurs  for  a  relatively  narrow  range  of  initial 
cloud  sizes  (Fig.  3).  These  sizes  coincide  with  the  typical  values  of  σ0  for  those  fountains  where  the  atoms  are 

released from a MOT. We also note that in the experiment reported in [6] the MOT contained a very large number 
of atoms (109), making the initial cloud larger (σ0 = 1.7 mm) and hotter (T0 = 2.8 μK), thus the shift variation was 

not observed and no cancellation could occur. 

Our  experiments  were  performed  on  two  entirely  independent  primary  frequency  standards:  NPL-CsF1  at 

National  Physical  Laboratory  and  PTB-CSF1  at  Physikalisch-Technische  Bundesanstalt.  The  set-ups,  already 

 

3 

described in detail earlier [17, 18], operate in cyclic modes: 107-108 Cs atoms from a room temperature vapour are 

collected and cooled in a MOT. The atoms are then launched in moving optical molasses and further cooled. They 

typically reach an apogee at 85 cm (NPL) or 83 cm (PTB), which is, respectively, 31 cm and 39 cm above the centre 

of the Ramsey cavity. The launch temperature is found by measuring the time-of-flight width of the expanded cloud. 

The size of the cloud at launch is measured by imaging its fluorescence pattern on a CCD camera. The atoms are 
launched and prepared in the |F = 3, mF = 0〉 state by microwave and optical pulses. After the atoms have completed 
their flight in the fountain, passing twice through the Ramsey microwave cavity, the populations of |F = 3〉 and |F = 

4〉  are  detected  by  laser-induced  fluorescence.  With  two  separate  laser  beams  and  two  detectors  the  atomic 

populations can be measured and normalized to the total population.  

The collisional shift is found by operating the fountain at two different atom numbers (densities) and comparing 

the respective frequencies measured against a reference frequency standard (hydrogen maser). The linearity between 

Nat and the collisional frequency shift (i.e. average atomic density in the fountain) has been evaluated experimentally 

[17, 18]. The atom number is for instance set by varying the amplitude of the preparing microwave pulse.  

The  collisional  shift  is  expected  to  vary  linearly  with  ρ40  (Fig.  3),  which  can  be  changed  conveniently  by 
adjusting the amplitude of the microwave field in the Ramsey cavity: ρ40 = [sin(xπ/2)]2; where x is a measure of the 
field amplitude and x = 0.5 corresponds to the π/2 pulses optimising the fringe contrast. Operating the fountain for x 
≠ 0.5 leads to a certain reduction of the contrast (and of the short-term stability). It is possible to partially recover the 

contrast  by  always  applying  a  full  π/2  pulse  at  the  second  passage  through  the  Ramsey  cavity  [19].  We  chose, 

however, not to vary the field amplitude during the Ramsey time as doing so (e.g. through an operation of a variable 

microwave attenuator) could have introduced a spurious phase shift and consequently a systematic frequency shift. 

The results for the NPL-CsF1 are shown in Fig. 4a where we plotted the collisional frequency shift as a function 
of ρ40. The parameter ρ40 was varied in the range 0.18 to 0.82, which corresponds to a microwave field amplitude in 
the cavity in the range 0.28 < x < 0.72. The linear function is a very good fit to the experimental points. From the 
fitted line we find the cancellation point ρ40
CsF1  (asymmetric  initial  cloud:  σ0

(C) for the collisional shift. For the experimental conditions of the NPL-
vertical =  1.0  mm and  T0 =  1.2  μK)  we  got  ρ40

horizontal = 0.5  mm,  σ0

(C)  =  0.396  ± 

0.012.  Similar  results  for  the  PTB-CsF1  are  shown  in  Fig.  4b.  The  linear  function  is  again  a  perfect  fit  to  the

same rate of the collisional shift variation was obtained for operation in the vicinity  of 3π/2 pulse area (grey data 

points in Fig. 4b). The quoted uncertainties are statistical one-standard-deviation uncertainties. 

To confirm that our observations result from a genuine effect and not from an artefact, e.g. related to variations 

of  the  preparing  microwave  pulse,  we  used  other  methods  for  setting  the  atom  number  in  the  collisional  shift 

measurement, i.e. we varied the detuning of the selection pulse or the MOT loading time. The data obtained with 

these different methods were consistent within statistical uncertainties. We also repeated the measurements using a 
new set-up CsF2 being developed at NPL. For σ0 = 0.7 mm and T0 = 1 μK we got ρ40
(C) = 0.43 ± 0.11. The values of 
ρ40
limited by uncertainties of σ0. 

(C) obtained in all three experimental set-ups agree well with the theoretical model, although the comparison is

The possibility of the collisional shift cancellation may lead to an improvement of the performance of caesium 
fountain standards similar to those described above. First we note that in a fountain working at ρ40 = 0.4 (x = 0.44) 
the fringe contrast (hence the signal to noise ratio and the short-term stability) is only reduced by 3.5% (16% for ρ40 

=  0.3).  We  further  note  that,  if  the  launch  parameters  and  the  microwave  field  amplitude  in  the  cavity  were 
sufficiently  stable,  uncertainty  of  the  collisional  shift  at  parts  in  1016  should  be  achievable  without  the  need  of 

extrapolation, which would shorten the averaging time. According to the data from Fig. 4, a modest instability  of 
(C) would result in a collisional shift not larger than 3×10-17. Here, more important 
0.1% in the field amplitude at ρ40

would be the stability of the zero-shift point position, which depends on the launch parameters. Alternatively, one 

can  operate  a  fountain  in  the  vicinity  of  the  zero-shift  point  and  extrapolate  the  residual  shift  to  zero  density. 

Assuming that the deviation in linearity between Nat and the density causes an error in the collisional shift evaluation 
of less than 10% of the shift itself [18], the uncertainty of the shift may be reduced to parts in 1017, if one can neglect 
collisions with atoms residually populating the |F = 3, mF ≠ 0〉 state. We should mention that the exact position of 

the zero-shift point may be affected by cavity pulling, an effect that also depends on the number of atoms passing 
the  Ramsey  cavity  and  on  the  microwave  power  level  in  the  cavity  (thus  on  ρ40)  [20].  This  effect,  however,  is 
estimated to be small (≤ 10-16) for the fountains considered in this paper.  

The  present  findings  can  influence  the  interpretation  of  experiments  where  a  fountain  clock  is  run  at  multiple 
π/2 pulse  areas  to  check  for  power-dependent  systematic  effects.  Typically  the  pulse  area  is  optimised  near  a 
multiple of π/2  by maximising the contrast of the Ramsey pattern. In general this will lead to a different value of ρ40 
than  for  1π/2  pulse  area.  As  a  consequence,  the  difference  in  the  collisional  shift  might  dominate  the  frequency 

shifts observed as a function of pulse area. 

To  conclude,  we  have  demonstrated  experimentally  that  the  frequency  shift  due  to  collisions  between  cold 

atoms in a caesium fountain clock strongly depends on the proportion of the two clock state populations, |3,0〉 and 

|4,0〉,  established  after  the  first  passage  through  the  microwave  cavity.  From  the  measured  values  of  the  shift  it 
follows that collision rates λ30 and λ40 have  opposite signs, making it possible to  cancel the collisional shift for a 
particular composition of the clock states. This is predicted by theory for the temperatures well below 1 μK, but not 

for the typical launch temperatures in the fountains (1-2 μK). We have shown that the sub-μK temperatures may be 

effectively reached during the Ramsey time owing to correlations between position and velocity, which develop in 

an expanding atomic cloud. The correlations and the reduction of the effective temperature are more pronounced for 

smaller initial clouds (e.g. when atoms are collected in a MOT, rather than in an optical molasses). In the reported 

experiments, the collisional frequency shift is cancelled for the fraction of the |4,0〉 atoms in the range of 30-40%, 

which can be achieved experimentally with only a minor reduction of the fringe contrast and short-term stability of 

the fountain frequency standard.

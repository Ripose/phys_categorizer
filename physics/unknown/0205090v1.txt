Abstract 
The failure stresses and strains of nanotubes given by theoretical or numerical predictions are much higher 
-atom 
than observed in experiments. We show that defects can explain part of this discrepancy: for an 
8
, the range of failure stresses for a molecular mechanics calculation is found to be 
defect with 
36 GPa   to  64
.  This  compares  quite  well  with  upper  end  of  the  experimental  failure  stresses, 
11 GPa  to 63
. The computed failure strains are 4% to 8%, whereas the experimental values are 2% 
to  13%.  The  underprediction  of  failure  strains  can  be  explained  by  the  slippage  that  occurred  in  the 
experiments.  The  failure  processes  of  nanotubes  are  clearly  brittle  in  both  the  experiments  and  our 
calculations.

Several  theoretical  and  several  experimental  studies  have  been  made  of  the 
strength of nanotubes, although values of the strength have so far only been measured in 
Yu  et  al[1].   One of the  first  theoretical studies of the strength of nanotubes predicted a 
failure  stress  of  300 GPa   and  a  failure  strain  of  about  30%[2].  However,  it  has  been 
shown in Belytschko et al[3] that these large computed values of failure strain and failure 
stress were an anomaly due to the cutoff function in the Brenner potential that was used 
in  these  computations;  Shenderova  et  al[4]  have  also  noted  this  spurious  effect  of  the 
cutoff function. Belytschko et al[3] calculated the strength for defect-free nanotubes to be 
93 GPa   with  a  modified  Morse  potential.    In  addition,  they  showed  that  the  predicted 
failure is brittle and that the failure strength depends largely on the inflection point in the 
interatomic  potential;  it  is  almost  independent  of  the  separation  energy.  Neither  the 
results of Yakobson[2] nor the results of Belytschko et al[3] are in good agreement with the 
experiments of Yu et al[1], where most of the failure stresses were much lower. 

Figure 1 shows a histogram of the failure stresses measured by Yu et al[1]. As can 
be  seen,  the  distribution  of  the  measured  failure  stresses  is  very  large.  Large  scatter  in 
failure  stresses  is  also  a  characteristic  of  brittle  macroscale  fracture,  where  the  scatter 
arises  because  the  initiating  mechanisms  are  small  cracks  and  defects  that  have  large 
variations in size.  Such scatter in macroscale structures is commonly fitted by a Weibull 
distribution,  in  which  the  largest  probability  of  failure  occurs  at  a  mean  value  and  the 
probability of failure decreases exponentially above or below the mean value.  However, 
the  measured  values  of  the  failure  stresses  of  the  nanotubes  do  not  appear  to  follow  a 
Weibull distribution. Instead, the failure stresses exhibit distinct clusters about a series of 
decreasing values of strength: the maximum reported failure stress is 63 GPa , and there 
appear  to  be  clusters  at  40
.  This  suggests  that  the 
failure  of  these  nanotubes  is  governed  by  defects  with  discrete  integer  atoms  and  their 
strength reduces below the maximum of a perfect nanotube. Because of the small size of 
nanotubes relative to the atomic scale, any defect would have a much larger effect on the

strength  than  in  macroscale  structures,  so  a  clustering  below  the  defect-free  strength 
would be expected.

In this note, we describe a series of calculations and suggest that the reduction in 
strength  is  due  to  missing  pairs  of  Carbon  atoms.  The  computations  were  molecular 
mechanics calculations at 0 K . We use a modified Morse potential given in Belytschko et

In the experiments of Yu et al[1], arc-grown multi-walled nanotubes were attached 
to opposing AFM cantilever tips by a solid carbonaceous material deposited on the tips. 
In most cases, only the outer nanotube was attached to the cantilever, and only the outer 
nanotube  failed.  Therefore,  only  the  outer  nanotube  was  modeled  here.  The  outer 
nanotubes  varied  in  length  from  1.8 mµ   to  10.99 mµ   and  their  diameters  varied  from 
13 nm   to  36
,  so  the  number  of  atoms  in  the  outer  nanotubes  varied  from 
approximately  4  million  to  54  million.  Models  of  this  size,  though  feasible,  are  very 
awkward  so  we  used  [80,0]  to  [100,0]  nanotubes.  The  nanotubes  studied  here  are 
significantly smaller than those used in the experiments but we show that the results are 
almost independent of the size of the model for the defects studied here.

-atom defects on the failure stress and failure strain is 
independent  of  the  size  of  nanotubes,  [80,0]  and  [100,0]  zigzag  nanotubes  of  various 
lengths were studied with a 4-atom defect. The radii of the nanotubes were 3.1
 and 
 respectively. Table II shows the failure stresses and strains for these nanotubes.

As can be seen, the effect of the radius and length on the failure stresses and strains is 
quite small for a 4-atom defect. Armchair nanotubes are studied here also. As mentioned 
[3],  the  failure  stresses  and  failure  strains  of  armchair  nanotubes  are 
in  Belytschko  et  al
slightly higher than those of zigzag nanotubes.

Figure. 3 Computed stress-strain curves compared to the experimental results 

 

Figure  3  shows  the  stress-strain  curve  for  the  [80,0]  nanotubes  with  2-atom,  4-
atom and 6-atom defects as compared to the experimental results. It can be seen that all 
of  the  failure  stresses  for  defective  nanotubes  fall  within  the  experimentally  observed 
range. The failure processes are clearly brittle, with a sudden complete drop in the force 
carried  by  the  tube.  In  the  molecular  mechanics  simulations,  in  the  failure  process  all 
bonds  along  the  circumference  next  to  the  defect  broke  simultaneously  at  the  critical 
displacement. On the other hand, in molecular dynamics simulations, the defect initiated 
a crack which propagated around the circumference of the tube. The axial force dropped 
to zero in about 0.78 picoseconds. 

As  can  be  seen  from  Figure  3,  the  failure  strains  predicted  in  these  studies  are 
significantly  lower  than  those  observed  experimentally  in  Yu  et  al[1].  However,  as 
reported  in  Belytschko  et  al[3],  re-examination  of  the  experiments  led  to  the  conclusion 
that  some  slippage  may  have  occurred  in  the  experiments  at  the  AFM  tips.  Therefore 
underprediction of the failure strains is to be expected.  

The failure stresses are also shown in Figure 1. For the modified Morse potential 
function,  the  highest  observed  failure  strength  agrees  reasonably  well  with  the  2-atom 
defect and the agreement with the clusters of failure is quite good. This good agreement 
suggests  that  our  hypothesis  about  the  role  of  defects  in  the  strength  of  nanotubes  has 
some merit.

It should be noted that a single 

Defects  in  carbon  nanotubes  can  arise  from  various  causes.  Chemical  defects 
consist  of  atoms/groups  covalently  attached  to  the  carbon  lattice  of  the  tubes  like 
oxidized  carbon  sites  or  chemical  vapor  deposition[7][8].  Topological  defects  correspond 
to  the  presence  of  rings  other  than  hexagons,  mainly  studied  as  pentagon/heptagon 
pairs[9]. Incomplete bonding defects like vacancies may have been caused through impact 
by high energy electrons in the TEM environment, see Smith and Luzzi[10] and Banhart[11] 
or may be defects in the original outer nanotube shell. The thermal conductivity of carbon 
nanotubes  that  is  dependent  of  the  vacancies  has  been  studied[12].  For  a  non-stressed 
single-walled  nanotube  of  diameter  ~1.4
,  the  atom  knockout  energy  by  electron

. This is 
impact has been estimated and also experimentally verified to be of order 85
significantly  below  the  maximum  energy  of  the  electrons  in  a  scanning  electron 
[1]. This suggests the strong possibility that the defects are 
microscope, as used by Yu et al
missing  atoms  in  the  outermost  shell  of  these  MWCNTs  prior  to  the  tensile  loading 
experiments, that is, from the synthesis. 
n

-atom defect in the entire outer nanotube suffices 
to  bring  about  the  reduction  in  strength  indicated  in  Table  I.  Since  the  outer  nanotubes 
consists of 4 million to 54 million atoms, the occurrence of a few such defects within a 
nanotube  are  quite  likely  even  if  the  frequency  is  as  low  as  1  per  1000  atoms. 
Furthermore,  according  to  our  model,  the  number  of  defects  will  have  little  effect  on 
strength  as  long  as  they  are  far  enough  apart  so  as  not  to  interact.  In  [80,0]  nanotube, 
there are almost no synergistic or accumulative effects of 4-atom defects if the separation 
exceeds 8.3 nm .

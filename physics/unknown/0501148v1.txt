Abstract  

 

This paper inspects more closely the problem of the momentum and energy of a bound (non-
radiating) electromagnetic (EM) field. It has been shown that for an isolated system of non-
relativistic  mechanically  free  charged  particles  a  transformation  of  mechanical  to  EM  mo-
mentum  and  vice  versa  occurs  in  accordance  with  the  requirement 
=const,  where

ton’s third law in EM interaction. If such a system contains bound charges, fixed on insula-
tors then, according to the assumption of a number of authors, a so-called “hidden” momen-
tum can contribute into the total momentum of the system. The problem of “hidden momen-
tum” (pro and contra) is also examined in the paper, as well as the law of conservation of to-
tal energy for different static configurations of the system “magnetic dipole plus charged par-
ticle”.  Analyzing  two  expressions  for  electromagnetic  momentum  of  a  bound  EM  field,

provide  a  continuous  implementation  of  the  momentum  conservation  law.  Finally,  we  con-
sider the energy flux in a bound EM field, using the Umov’s vector. It has been shown that 
Umov vector can be directly derived from Maxwell’s equations. A new form of the momen-
tum-energy  tensor,  which  explicitly  unites  the  mechanical  and  EM  masses,  has  been  pro-
posed. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
It is well known that local validity of the energy conservation law requires the equality of the 

partial time derivative of electromagnetic (EM) energy in some spatial volume V,

is the energy density of the EM field. One sees from Eq. (1) that 

Considering  Eq.  (2),  Poynting  proposed  to  use  the  Maxwell  equations  to  evaluate  the  field

(cid:1)
Applying Eqs. (5), (6) to an EM radiation, one can see that the direction of  S

 coin-
cides with that of EM wave propagation, and the term 
 corresponds to an absorption of 
EM radiation by charged particles. The same Eqs. (5) and (6) are also customarily applied to 
a non-radiating EM field, and according to a general theorem of classical mechanics, a mo-
(cid:1)

 for both EM radiation and non-radiating EM field is defined as

We should mention that Bessonov in a number of his papers (see, e.g. [2]) showed that the energy 
balance  equation  (5)  meets  a  number  of  physical  difficulties,  when  the  point-like charged parti-
cles are involved. The problem becomes worse when the self-forces of electromagnetic fields of 
particles are also taken into account. However, an analysis of these problems and their resolution 
in [2] fall outside the scope of the present paper. In the next section we consider an isolated sys-
tem of non-relativistic mechanically free charged particles and prove that a transformation of me-

in a bound EM field, using the Umov’s vector. Finally, section 5 represents the conclusions.

MECHANICAL MOMENTA 
 
First consider the interaction of two non-radiating free charged particles q1 and q2, moving at

chanical momentum of this isolating system.

Assuming that the velocities of both particles are non-relativistic, the scalar and vector poten-
tials produced by the particle q2 at the location of particle q1, and vice versa can be written to 
the accuracy of the order c-2, [3]:

should  be  inevitably  non-equivalent  to  each  other.  Below  in  section  3  we  will  consider  a 
number  of  physical  problems,  which  clearly  indicate  the  difference  between  both  momenta 
for dynamical EM systems.  

Now look closer on physics of Eq. (19). First of all, we mention that the Lagrangian 
(9),  used  in  our  theorem,  does  not  include  the  radiation  reaction.  The  latter  effect  is  taken 
negligible by supposition (the accelerations of particles are small)2.  

We  also  have  to  stress  that  Eq.  (19)  is  valid  for  inertial  reference  frames  only,  al-
though a motion of particles under observation can be arbitrary (with small accelerations, al-
lowing  for  the  neglect  of  EM  radiation).  Consideration  of  interaction  between  two  particles 
from a non-inertial reference frame, attached to one of them, does not give Eq. (19) and leads 
to a seeming paradox with the momentum conservation law [7]. 

Further,  we  notice  that  the  momentum 

  of  a  considered  system  is  not  associated 
with an energy flux across the boundary of that system. Following to [8], we propose to name 
(cid:1)
AP

 as "potential" momentum.  

Eq. (19) loses its physical meaning in the case of EM radiation, when the sources of 
the EM field, in general, may be absent in an arbitrary space volume. Hence, for that (source-
free)  kind  of  EM  fields,  the  momentum  density  is  solely  defined  by  the  conventional  and 
more general expression through the Poynting vector 

.

Eq. (19) also loses its meaning in case of a single isolating particle (N=1), when the 
(cid:1)
 would mean a self-action of the particle. Hence, for such a particle the momentum 
term  Aq
of EM field is exclusively determined by Eq. (8).  

Nevertheless,  in  many  problems  of  classical  electrodynamics,  dealing  with  quasi-
static systems, the application of “potential” momentum instead of Eq. (8) greatly simplifies 
calculations. In this connection it is necessary to explain that for the system of N free charged

 cannot be attributed to its proper total mo-

Let us consider another example: a charged particle q orbits around a tall solenoid S at 
 
the constant angular frequency w (Appendix B, Fig. 5). In this problem the net force, acting 
on  the  particle,  is  equal  to  zero,  while  its  “momentum” 
  changes  with  time.  More-
over, this value defines the potential momentum of the whole system “charged particle + so-
lenoid”. Then it follows from Eq. (19) that the total time derivative 
 should be equal 
to the force, acting on the solenoid due to the particle. This result is confirmed by the particu-
lar calculations, presented in Appendix B.

The  revealed  physical  meaning  of  the  “potential”  momentum  is  masked  in  familiar 
textbooks, which usually begin a consideration of electrodynamics from a motion of charged 
particle in some abstract external EM field. By such a way it is impossible to find that the to-
(cid:1)

tal  time  derivative  of  the  momentum

acting on the sources of this external field. At the same time, it seems that this interpretation 
creates a difficulty for the energy conservation law: for example, it seems that for the prob-
lem in Appendix B the particle can rotate around the solenoid infinitely long (if we neglect its 
radiation),  while  the  solenoid  receives  a  force  which  can  make  work.  This  and  other  para-

Two  counter-rotating  oppositely  charged  insulating  disks,  whose  rotation  is  slowed 
down by mutual friction, are in the electric field of a charged particle, which rests in a labora-
tory (Fig. 1). The particle and the disks lie in the plane xy. We want to compute the force, act-
ing on the charged particle, as well as the force, acting on the whole isolating system “particle 
+ rotating disks”.  

For  the  sake  of  simplicity  we  assume  that  the  charge  is  homogeneously  distributed 
over the perimeter of disks. The rotational axis of disks z passes across the point x, y=0, and 
at the initial instant the charge has coordinates {0, R, 0}. The radius of each disk is r0<R.  

Let  initially  the  rotational  angular  frequency  of  both  disks  was  equal  to w,  and  the

magnetic moment  m

Fig. 1. The Shockley-James paradox 

 
We see that the mechanical momentum of charged particle Q after annihilation of magnetic 
dipole  coincides  with  the  potential  momentum  of  the  system  -QA(R)  before  annihilation. 
Shockley and James noticed that a motion of the particle Q for resting axis of the disks means 
a  motion  of  the  center  of  mass  of  all  system  “disks  +  particle”,  which  seems  to  contradict 
special relativity. In order to resolve this paradox, they introduced a “hidden” momentum of

[10] in connection with a classical model of neutron. As a basic point, they proved a theorem

  is  the  electric  field  on  the  momentum

. Then one can see that Eq. (29) fully resolves the Shockley-James paradox: the disks do 
bjm
indeed move in the opposite direction of the charge due to their hidden momentum, and the 
center of mass does remain at rest. 
One should note that manifestation of hidden momentum is model dependent [10]. In 
 
the model of a magnetic dipole involving counter-rotating charged insulating disks, the exter-
nal electric field causes the mechanical stresses, as mentioned in [10]. A Lorentz transforma-
tion of the stress-energy tensor converts stress to momentum density. This contribution leads 
to the net mechanical momentum (28) in the rest frame of the center of the disks. 
 
2.2. “Hidden momentum”: contra 
1. A resolution of the Shockley James paradox (a rest of the center of mass) signifies that we 
recover the principle of equality of action and reaction for the system “charge plus magnetic 
dipole”.  One  follows  from  there  that  no  net  external  force  is  applied  under  assembling  the 
configuration. However, this statement comes into a contradiction with the resolution of the 
Lewis-Tolman paradox [11].  
 
2. A physical origin of “hidden momentum” continues to be vague. For example, for a 
point-like  magnetic  dipole, the electric field at its location can be assumed to be essentially 
constant.  Hence,  no  additional mechanical stresses appear inside the dipole due to this con-
stant field, and no converted momentum density emerges. And what is more important, a no-
tion of “hidden momentum” contradicts the Lorentz force law, when the assembling process 
of  the  system  “charge  plus  magnetic  dipole”  is  considered.  For  example,  let  us  analyze  the 
(cid:1)
 (like in Fig. 1) 
problem depicted in Fig. 2. A point-like electrically neutral magnetic dipole m
and  a  very  long  uniformly  charged  wire  with  the  length  L  initially  are  separated  by  a  large 
distance  x0.  Nevertheless,  x0<<L.  Initially  the  dipole  and  wire  rest  in  a  laboratory,  so  that 
there is no interaction between them. The dipole and wire lie in the xy-plane, the wire is par-
(cid:1)
allel  to  the  axis  y,  and  the  magnetic  moment  m
  is  parallel  to  the  axis  z.  Then  the  wire  ac-
quires a very small velocity v in the negative x-direction, and it is driven up to the distance h 
from the dipole, while the dipole is maintained fixed in space. After this stage of assembling 
the  velocity  of  wire  becomes  to  be  equal  to  zero,  and  any  forces  exerted  on  the  system  are 
vanishing. At this moment the system can be considered as static. Further, the magnetic mo-
(cid:1)
  to  zero  during  the  time t  (the  stage  of  annihilation  of  mag-
ment  slowly  decreases  from  m
netic dipole).  

The stage of annihilation is similar to the Shockley-James paradox, and the force, act-

ing on the wire can be found as

Next  compute  the  Lorentz  force,  acting  on  the  magnetic  dipole  due  to  the  moving 
charged wire. Since the dipole is electrically neutral, it is not experienced an electric force. In 
addition,  the  moving  wire  does  not  create  a  magnetic  field  in  the  plane  xy.  Indeed,  in  this 
(cid:1)

 are collinear to each other (

in the rest frame of magnetic dipole. Observe that the component of magnetic field Bz, created 
by the moving wire, is identically equal to zero, because in the proper frame of wire the com-
ponent Ey=0 (the wire is very long), and 
. Hence, one gets from the field transformation 
between  the  wire’s  rest  frame  to  the  rest  frame  of  dipole,  that  Bz”0.  Thus,  the  force  (34)  is 
also identically equal to zero. 
 
Finally, we can apply one more way to compute the force, acting on the magnetic di-
pole  in  the  rest  frame  of  the  wire.  In  this  frame  the  dipole  moves at the constant velocity v 
 has to appear, which the wire’s 
along the x-axis, and an electric dipole moment

As we mentioned above, for a long wire the electric field is not changed along its axis (the 
axis y), and this force is equal to zero. 
 
Thus, applying the Lorentz force law, we have proved by three different ways that no 
force  exerted  on  the  magnetic  dipole  during  the  assembling  of  the  system  (motion  of  the 
charged wire along the axis -x). 

From  there  we  conclude  that  the  mechanical  momentum  (33),  transmitted  to  the 
charged  wire  during  the  assembling  of  the  system,  represents  the  total  mechanical  momen-
tum, transmitted to the system at the whole. (This example explicitly indicates a violation of 
Newton’s third law in EM interaction). Hence, a stored non-vanishing momentum of the sys-

tem in its static state should inevitably exist, which coincides with the momentum (33). One 

can  easily  check  that  it  is  equal  to  the  potential  momentum  of  the  system

which, in turn, coincides with the Poynting momentum (8) for a static configuration. In fact, 
we  observe  a  transformation  of  the  mechanical  momentum  (33),  transmitted  to  the  system 
during its assembling, to the EM momentum of that system. This exact transformation of me-
chanical to electromagnetic momentum leaves no place for a “hidden momentum” of a mag-
netic dipole. Moreover, if we would demand a rest of the center of mass of the system after 
annihilation of magnetic dipole (causing a cancel of EM momentum), we would get a viola-
tion of the momentum conservation law: the system after annihilation has zero EM momen-
tum  and  zero  total  mechanical  momentum,  while  during  its  assembling  the  non-vanishing 
mechanical momentum (33) was transmitted to the system. Thus, there is no mystery that the 
center of mass of the system does move after annihilation of magnetic dipole: it occurs due to 
mechanical momentum, transmitted to the system during its assembling. We can name it as 
“retro-momentum”.  Such  a  “retro-momentum”  substitutes  the  “hidden  momentum”  in  the 
theorem by Aharonov et al. (Eq. (28)). At the same time, we have to underline that the “hid-
den momentum” and “retro-momentum” have quite different physical meaning. The “hidden 
momentum”  exists  instantaneously,  and  the  center  of  mass  of  the  system  “magnetic  dipole 
plus  charged  particle”  remains  at  rest,  while  the  magnetic  dipole  is  annihilating  (the 
Shockley-James  problem);  the  “retro-momentum”  represents  the  mechanical  momentum 
transmitted to the system during its assembling in past, and stored in the EM momentum of 
the  system.  Then  during  annihilation  of  the  magnetic  dipole,  the  center  of  mass  does  move 
due to this stored momentum. In another words, using a notion of “retro-momentum”, we in-
evitably  get  a  violation  of  Newton’s  third  law  in  EM  interaction,  while  the  introducing  of 
“hidden  momentum”  maintains  the  equality  of  action  and  reaction  in  the  system  “charged 
particles plus magnetic dipoles”. Hence, a rejection of “hidden momentum” seems leave the 
paradox in Appendix B to be non-resolved: a non-radiating charged particle, rotating around 
a solenoid, is not experienced any force, but induces a forced motion of the solenoid. In turn, 
this forced motion can make work, which becomes infinite for infinitely long rotation of the 
particle.  
 
It  seems  that  the  problem  of  choosing  between  “hidden  momentum”  and  “retro-
momentum” is reduced to an unpleasant choice: either to refuse from the Lorentz force law 
(in favor of “hidden momentum”), or to refuse from the energy conservation law in the exer-
cise  of  Appendix  B  (in  favor  of  “retro-momentum”).  However,  next sub-section shows that 
the paradox of Appendix B can be resolved without “hidden momentum”.  
 
2.3. About momentum-energy conservation law for static configuration “charged particle 
and magnetic dipole (without “hidden momentum”). 
Let us analyze the energy balance for fundamental configuration “point like electrically neu-
tral magnetic dipole plus point-like charged particle”, both resting in a laboratory. The energy 
density of EM field is determined by Eq. (1), and the total EM energy is

We see that the latter integral is divided into a sum of two parts, where the first integral (con-
taining the electric field) is fully determined by the charge q of the particle, while the second 
(cid:1)
 of the 
integral (containing the magnetic field) is fully determined by the magnetic moment m
dipole.  Therefore,  for  any  static  configuration  of  the  system  “magnetic  dipole  plus  charged 
(cid:1)
 between the charge and dipole, i.e., it 
particle”, the energy does not depend on the distance  r

 

12

Further, one can see from Eq. (8) that the EM momentum of the system certainly de-
, because it is determined by the cross product of the 

(cid:1)
. Thus, different static configurations of the system, 
represents a constant value for fixed q, m
(cid:1)
being  characterized  by  different  position  vectors  of  q  and  m
,  have  the  same  EM  energy.  It 
follows from there that any transitions between different static configurations (changes of the 
(cid:1)
)  can  happen  without  receiving  of  any  external  energy.  Indeed, 
distances  between  q  and  m
under transportation of the charge q from one spatial point to another at the infinitesimal ve-
(cid:1)
, the work done can be negligible, because the magnetic force, exerted by the mag-
locity  v
(cid:1)
netic  dipole  on  moving  charge,  is  always  orthogonal  to  v
.  During  this  transportation  the 
magnetic  dipole  can  be  simply  fixed  in  space  by  the  external  force,  compensating  the force 
due to the moving charge. 
 
(cid:1)

  and  B

(cid:1)

 being the vector potential of the dipole at the location of charge. Thus, we 
,  A
conclude that different static configurations “magnetic dipole plus charged particle” represent 
degenerate  states  with  respect  to  the  energy,  but  non-degenerate  states  with  respect  to  the 
momentum (for both direction and magnitude). Taking into account the law of conservation 
of total momentum (electromagnetic plus mechanical), we get at first glance a difficulty with 
implementation of the law of conservation of total energy. Indeed, under any transitions be-
tween different configurations (which occur without loss of energy), the change of EM mo-
mentum  leads  to  the  appearance  of  mechanical  momentum  of  the  system.  As  a  result,  a  ki-
netic energy of the system emerges, seemingly from “nothing”. How to resolve this paradox? 
First of all, we have to mention that the transitions between actually static configura-
tions imply a presence of mechanical counter-forces compensating the forces, exerted on the 
particle  and  magnetic  dipole  during  the  transition.  Hence,  the  mechanical  kinetic  energy  of 
the system remains to be equal to zero. As soon as we exclude the compensating forces, the 
particle and magnetic dipole both acquire non-vanishing velocities and corresponding kinetic 
(cid:1)
.  However,  for  these  non-vanishing  velocities,  the  magnetic 
energies  during  variation  of  r
(cid:1)
dipole  acquires  the  electric  dipole  moment 
,  while  the  particle  produces  the 
p
=
magnetic  field.  Then  the  magnetic  dipole  contributes  into  the  electric  field  of  Eq.  (35),  and 
charged  particle  contributes  into  the  magnetic  field  of  Eq.  (35).  As  a  result,  the  EM  energy 
(cid:1)
. In particular, one can show that the change of kinetic energy 
becomes to be dependent on  r
(cid:1)
 is equal to the change of EM energy (35) with the reverse 
of the system under variation of  r
sign, and the energy conservation law is perfectly implemented.

This  analysis  gives  a  key  for  resolution of the paradox in Appendix B (rotation of a 
charged particle around a solenoid). If, by supposition, no compensating force acts on the so-
lenoid, that it acquires a finite velocity and finite electric dipole moment. One can show that 
the electric field of electric dipole is opposite to the momentary velocity of particle, causing a 
loss of its kinetic energy. Therefore, an infinitely long rotation of the particle is impossible. 

Nevertheless, a possibility to transform EM energy into kinetic energy without a loss 
(or minimal loss) of external energy seems very attractive, because a coefficient of efficiency 
of such transformer can be equal almost to unity.

equivalence of Eqs. (19) and (36) can be also seen from examination of their general proper-
ties.  
 
One can see that Eq. (36) is obviously gauge-invariant. However, it is not true for Eq.

Further, Eq. (36) is the Lorentz-invariant, while Eq. (19) is not. In order to prove the

The non-invariance of Eq. (19) is not surprising, because it was derived on the basis 
of  approximate  expressions  (14).  Therefore,  we  may  expect  that  not  Eq.  (19),  but  Eq.  (36) 
should adequately describe the dynamical non-radiative systems. Unfortunately, the problem 
happens to be more complicated. We will show below that the requirement of a continuity of 
the  momentum  conservation  law  is  better  fitted  into  Eq.  (19),  than  Eq.  (36).  The  latter  re-

Let  us  come  back  to  the Shockley-James problem (Fig. 1), where we tacitly implied 
that 
,  neglecting  any  retardation.  Now  consider  a  limit  of  very  large  R,  so  that 
, but the radiation processes are still negligible. In this limit we will analyze a be-
cR<<t
havior of the system at the time ranges 0<t<R/c, R/c<t<(R/c)+t, t>R/c+t, testing both concur-
(cid:1)
rent expressions for momentum of a bound EM field: Eq. (8) and “potential” momentum  AQ
. 
In  our  analysis  we  omit  a  “hidden  momentum”,  although  its  adoption  only  complicates  the 
analysis, but does not essentially influence the derived conclusions. Further, we take into ac-
count  a  retardation  effect,  according  to  which  the  time-variable  current  i(t)  associated  with 
the rotating disks produces the EM field at the instant (t’=t-r/c), where r is the distance be-
tween the axis of point-like disks and point of observation [3]. 
 
1. 0<t<R/c. During the time t both disks stop rotating, and the magnetic moment van-
ishes. In this time range the mechanical momentum of the system is equal to zero, because a 
perturbation of the magnetic field from the magnetic dipole does not reach the point of loca-
tion  of  Q.  Correspondingly,  the  potential  momentum  of  the  system 
  is  also  un-
changed. At the same time, the Poynting momentum (8) of the disks decreases with time, be-
cause the perturbation of magnetic field is spreading in space.  
2.  R/c<t<(R/c)+t. In this  time  range  the potential momentum of the system decreases

(cid:1)
 to 0, and the mechanical momentum  QP

(8) is not changed significantly. 
 
 3. t>R/c+t. Within this time range the mechanical momentum of the system is no longer 
changed,  while  the  Poynting  momentum  (8)  continues  to  decrease  with  time,  going  to  zero  for 
tﬁ¥. 
 
The observations 1-3 clearly indicate that the law of conservation of total momentum for 
an isolated system is implemented continuously only in the case, where the electromagnetic mo-
mentum is defined though the potential momentum of the system. On the other hand, using the 
Poynting  definition  (8)  for  EM  momentum,  we  get  a  violation  of  the  momentum  conservation 
law for all time ranges considered, excepting tﬁ¥. 
Thus,  the  gauge  non-invariant  and  Lorentz  non-invariant  Eq.  (19)  has  an  important 
 
advantage  in  comparison  with  Eq.  (36):  it  seems  to  provide  a  continuous  validity  of  the  mo-
mentum  conservation  law.  However,  this  advantage  of  Eq.  (19)  happens  to  be  apparent:  in  the 
next  problem  we  will  show  that  the  conception  of  potential  momentum,  in  general,  does  not 
prevent a local violation of the momentum conservation law (Fig. 3).  
A magnetic dipole m (two counter-rotating oppositely charged disks) is placed at the point 
 
x,y,z=0. At the initial instant the charge +Q has the coordinates {R, 0, 0}, while the charge –Q has 
the coordinates {R+l, 0, 0}, and l<<R. The radius of each disk is r0<<R. Both charges and mag-
netic dipole are at rest in a laboratory, and there is no mutual force between them. The potential 
momentum of the system is equal to

At the moment t=0 the charges are electrically connected by a conducting wire, and during a time 
interval t a current flows in the wire. Then for t>t both charges disappear, cancelling each other. 
The potential momentum (39) also vanishes. One requires determining a mechanical momentum 
of the system after annihilation of the charges, assuming that t<<R/c, and the radiative EM fields 
are  negligible.  We  again  analyze  this  problem  for  different  time  intervals  0<t<t,  t<t<(R/c),

However, in the time ranges 1-3 the law of conservation of total momentum was temporarily vio-
lated. 
 
Thus, the problem in Fig. 3 shows that the law of conservation of total momentum is not 
implemented continuously even in the case when the EM momentum is defined through a poten-
. It seems that neither Eq. (19), nor Poynting’s Eq. (36) satisfy the requirement 
tial momentum 
(38) of continuous implementation of the total momentum conservation law. We also recall that 
Eq. (19) is not gauge- and Lorentz-invariant. In these conditions there is an attractive way to si-
multaneously resolve all problems mentioned in this section: to assume that the bound EM fields 
spread instantaneously in space4. Indeed, in this case Eq. (38) is correct for both expressions for 
EM momentum, and we can always use the general equation (36) as the law of conservation of 
total  momentum.  Obviously,  this  familiar  equation  is  gauge-  and  Lorentz-invariant.  At  first 
glance,  since  an  instantaneous  action-at-a-distance  can  cancel  special  relativity,  the  Lorentz-
invariance is no longer important. However, in alternative space-time theories, based on covariant 
description  of  ether  (see,  e.g.,  [15])  the  requirement  of  Lorentz-invariance  continues  to  be  very 
significant.  
 
There is another strict physical reason to propose an instantaneous action-at-a-distance, if 
we consider the energy balance for the Shockley-James problem in its quasi-static and dynamical 
versions. 
First consider a quasi-static approximation, when t >> R/c, and determine the energy of 
 
the system before and after annihilation. At the initial time moment the energy of system is com-
posed from the mechanical rotational energy of disks R and the EM energy (35). During the proc-
ess of annihilation of magnetic moment, the disks receive a work W due to the frictional forces. If 
the disks were isolated (the charged particle is absent), then

account that the work of friction force W is finally transformed into the heat energy H. Returning 
to the Shockley-James problem (the charged particle is present), we assume that its velocity after 
annihilation  of  the  magnetic  dipole  is  essentially  non-relativistic.  This  allows  us  to  neglect  its 
magnetic field in comparison with the magnetic field of the rotating disks, as well as to take its 
electric  energy  in  Eq.  (35)  to  be  constant.  Hence,  there  is  a  single  essential  effect  of  a  charged 
particle, while it is moving: the change with time of its vector potential 
at the location of 

 exerts a 
the magnetic dipole. One sees from Fig. 1 that the induced electric field 
torque on the disks, which is opposite to the torque due to the friction forces. It is essential that in 
the  quasi-static  limit  both  torques  exist  simultaneously  (retardation  is  negligible).  Then  the  ex-
pression for work received by the disks is changed in comparison with Eq. (43):

where 
kE   is  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  charged  particle  after  annihilation  of  magnetic  moment. 
This equation signifies that the particle takes its kinetic energy, reducing the heating of the disks 
during annihilation of magnetic moment. We omit simple but extensive calculations, which prove 
an exact implementation of Eq. (45). 
Now consider the energy balance in the Shockley-James problem, when t << R/c. Then 
 
during  annihilation  of  magnetic  dipole,  the  charged  particle  Q remains at rest: a perturbation of 
the vector potential of magnetic dipole is not yet reaching Q, as we assume its propagation veloc-
ity c. The static electric field of this charge at the location of the magnetic dipole does not create 
any net forces, and the initial rotational and EM energies of the disks are fully transformed into 
the heat H (Eq. (44)). Hence, the law of conservation of energy requires that no mechanical en-
ergy  should  be  transmitted  to  the  particle.  However,  when  a  perturbation  of  magnetic  field 
reaches the particle (at t=R/c), it begins to move, and at the moment (t=R/c+t) it acquires the ki-
netic energy [QA(R)]2/2M, where A(R) is the initial value of the vector potential at the location of 
particle. Thus, we already get a contradiction with the energy conservation law. Moreover, at the 
instant t=2R/c, a perturbation of the vector potential 
 is reaching the charged disks, and 
they  again  begin  to  rotate  in  a  direction  opposite  to  the  direction  of  their  initial  rotation  at  t=0. 
The friction forces slow down the disks, extracting the additional heat energy

which should be added to the total energy of the system. As a result, we observe an obvious vio-
lation  of  the  energy  conservation  law  in  a  dynamical  version  of  the  Shockley-James  problem, 
when  the  bound  EM  field  propagates  at  a  finite  velocity.  The  correct  energy  balance  equation 
(44) is realized, if and only if the bound EM fields spread instantaneously.

4.  NOTES  ON  ENERGY  FLUX  IN  A  NON-RADIATING  ELECTROMAGNETIC 
FIELD 
 
We  already  mentioned  above  that  the  Poynting  expression  for  energy  flux  density 
(cid:1)
  is  traditionally  applied  to  both  free  and  bound  EM  fields,  although  for  the 
S
latter case such energy fluxes were never detected experimentally. There is another problem 
(cid:1)
(cid:1)
)BEc
(
with the definition 
 for a bound EM field, which is revealed through its appli-
·
(cid:1)
cation to a single charged particle, moving at the constant velocity  v
(cid:1)(cid:1)
 
 in Eq. (5) describes a self-action of the non-radiating in-
Ej
(cid:215)
ertially  moving  particle  with  its  own  electromagnetic field. Standard renormalization proce-
dure  implies  that  this  term  should  be  dropped.  However,  a  simple  cancellation  of  the  term 
(cid:1)(cid:1)
 leads to another physical difficulty. Namely, in the rest frame of a charged particle we 
Ej
(cid:215)
can write (du/dt)=0. In the laboratory frame this equality transforms into 

In such a case the term

One sees from there that we cannot simply omit the term 
 in Eq. (5), because by such a 
way we destroy an equivalence of Eqs. (5) and (46). From this point of view Eq. (46) seems 
more attractive, because it does not contain this term of self-action. Physically this means that 
the electromagnetic field moves uniformly in space together with its charged particle source 
(cid:1)
.  On  the  other  hand,  the  EM  field  in  Maxwell’s  electrodynamics  "knows" 
at  the  velocity  v
only two velocities: 0 and c. Hence, a representation of the EM field, moving at v<c cannot 
describe a real physical situation within this theory. As a result, we reveal that Eqs. (5) and 
(46),  being  equivalent  mathematically,  are  both  physically  unsatisfactory  for  the  Maxwell 
theory in the description of the energy flux of a single charged particle. In these conditions, 
the  following  method  of  overcoming  this  difficulty  has  been  proposed  (see  [18]  and  refer-
(cid:1)
 are relevant, but the 
ences therein): both expressions for the energy flux density,  S

However,  this idea seems to be wrong, when the system of N>1 charged particles is 
 the instantaneous velocities of particles at the considered instant 
considered. Let us denote 
(l=1...N).  We  assume  that  there  are  no  external  mechanical  forces,  and  the  accelerations  of 
particles are small enough to neglect their EM radiation. Generalizing the calculations (47)-
(cid:1)

charged  particles.  We  can  name  the  vector  UGS
  in  Eq.  (54)  as  “generalized”  Umov  vector, 
and it describes the "integral" energy flux density of a system of charged particles. We under-
line that Eq. (54) is compatible with Maxwell’s equations, because it has been obtained under 
generalization of Eqs. (47)-(52) to the case of N charged particles. If all particles move uni-

This shows that the resultant fields again move uniformly with the system of charged source 
particles. 
 
Now let us demonstrate that Eq. (55) disproves the idea about “differential” and “in-
tegral” energy fluxes. Indeed, consider the motion of a charged parallel plate capacitor in the 
direction normal to the plates (Fig. 4). The square plates have the size 
aa · , where a>>h, h 
being the distance between the plates. Then in the space region far from the boundaries of the

  is  constant  and  coincides  with  the  direction  of  velocity  of  the 
(cid:1)

zed  Umov  vector  is  equal  to 
:  the  electric  field  rigidly  moves  together  with 
the  plates.  However,  by  no  way  can  this  result  be  understood  with  the  Poynting  vector.  In-
=0, and there is no energy flux inside the capacitor 
deed, in this space region 
in  the  Poynting’s  meaning.  Therefore,  the  mentioned  above  conception  about  “differential” 
and “integral” energy flux cannot describe this effect. Only Eq. (55) remains relevant, and it 
should  be  interpreted  in  its  direct  meaning:  the  EM  field  rigidly  moves  together  with  the 
source  particles.  Hence,  the  same  interpretation  must  be  applied  to  the  single  particle  (Eq. 
(53). Insofar as the velocity of the particle exactly coincides with the velocity of the EM field 
configuration in the whole space, we have to adopt an instantaneous propagation of the bound 
EM fields.  
 
We  again  underline  that  Eqs.  (52)-(55),  leading  to  the  instantaneous  action-at-a-
distance, simultaneously represent the solutions of Maxwell’s equations. In this connection it 
is worth to mention the plurality of solutions of Maxwell’s equations [13, 19] revealed during 
past  years,  in  particular,  co-existence  of  hyperbolic  and  elliptic  solutions.  The  latter  corre-
spond  to  an  instantaneous  spread  in  space  of  bound  EM  fields,  guided  by  the  generalized 
Umov vector.  
 
These results indicate that free and bound EM fields represent different physical enti-
ties. Indeed, the non-radiating EM fields obey non-homogeneous Maxwell’s equation, while 
EM  radiation  obeys  homogeneous  Maxwell  equations.  It  simultaneously  means  that  there 
should  be  a  physical  mechanism,  allowing  distinguishing  the  bound  and  free  EM  fields  in 
their  mixture.  In  the  author’s  opinion,  such  a  physical  mechanism  is  based  on  the  fact  that 
EM  radiation  is  absorbed,  at  least  in  principle,  by  a  charged  particle,  while  a  non-radiating 
field is not (the change of kinetic energy of particle is equal to change of its electric potential 
energy  with  the  reverse  sign).  Therefore,  in general case we have to distinguish the energy-
momentum tensors for the free and bound EM fields. It is known that the motional equation

Eq.  (57)  represents  the  conventional  expression  for  the  tensor  of  EM  field.  However,  one 
should stress that the transformation of Eq. (56) into Eq. (58) uses the equality [3] 

which represents the Maxwell equation for a source-free EM field, i.e., EM radiation. There-
fore, the tensor (58) is applicable for the EM radiation. Thus, for a bound EM field we have 
to apply another gauge transformation of Eq. (56) to symmetric form than was made for EM 
radiation. One of the methods to solve this problem is to test different gauge functions  mngy  
in (57) to obtain a physically meaningful result. We can avoid such a complex way, proceed-
ing from Eq. (54) for the energy flux density in a bound EM field, which gives the compo-

done for the following modification of the tensor, which also satisfies the requirements (54)

As  concluded  in  [16],  Eq.  (61)  cannot  determine  the  tensor  of  EM  energy  of  a  non-
radiating  EM  field  in  the  general  case,  where  the  particles  move  at  velocities  variable  with 
time.  Indeed,  in  this  case  a  fraction  of  EM  energy  is  dissipated  as  EM  radiation,  and  the 
equality  (60)  is  violated.  One  can  check  that  simple  addition  of  the  tensor  of  EM  radiation 
(58) to lhs of Eq. (61) does not recover the equality (60) under variable velocities. This diffi-

culty reflects a known fact that Umov’s vector can be well defined only for constant veloci-
ties of sources of EM field.  

Now  we  are  able  to  overcome  this  difficulty,  noting  that  the  structure  of  Eq.  (62)  is 

very similar to the structure of the mechanical energy-momentum tensor [3]

where  mu  is the four-velocity, and r is the charge density. The obtained Eq. (66) shows that 
“mechanical”  and  “electromagnetic”  masses  are  both  the  intrinsic  parts  of  a  total  mass  of 
charged particle. The idea to include the EM mass in the total mass of charged particles is as 
old  as  the  classical  model  of  the  electron.  However,  to  the  best  of  the  author’s  knowledge, 
this  idea  was  forgotten  every  time,  when  the  tensor  of  EM  field  and  the  motional  equation 
were derived. Thus, the corrected Eq. (66) seems significant.  

We notice that the generalized Umov vector (54) describes propagation in space of a 
mass  density  of  EM  field.  For  a  single  moving  particle,  Eq.  (54)  transforms  to  the  conven-
tional Umov vector (53), which shows that EM mass moves at the same velocity as a source 
particle. The momentum density of a propagating bound EM field is determined as

for  the  energy  and  mass  densities  in  accordance  with  the  Einstein's  expression.  Integrating 
Eq. (68) over the whole space, we get 

 

U

(UEM is the total EM energy, MEM is the total EM mass). Thus, the expression of energy flux 
density through the vector of Umov eliminates the familiar problem "4/3" [20] for a moving 
electron, and realizes the relativistic expression (68) for the mass and energy densities.

Newton’s third law in EM interaction. If such a system contains bound charges, fixed on in-
sulators, then a “hidden” momentum can (by supposition of a number of authors) contribute 
to the total momentum of the system. However, we have shown that the conception of “hid-
den momentum” leads to a contradiction with the Lorentz force law (the problem in Fig. 2). 
Rejecting a “hidden momentum” and introducing a “retro-momentum” instead, we reveal that 
a static system “magnetic dipole plus charged particle” has a property as follows: its different 
configurations, characterized by different position vectors of the dipole and particle, represent 
degenerate  states  with  respect  to  EM  energy,  but  non-degenerate  states  with  respect  to  EM 
momentum (for both direction and magnitude). This opens a possibility to transform EM en-
ergy into kinetic energy without a loss (or minimal loss) of external energy.

for  quasi-static  configurations.  For  rapid  dynamical  processes,  where  a  time  evolution  of 
bound  EM  fields  is  essential,  the  two  expressions  for  EM  momentum  are  not  equivalent  to 
each other, and neither provides a continuous implementation of the total momentum conser-
vation law, if the bound EM fields propagate at the velocity c. Moreover, we found that the 
energy conservation law cannot be fulfilled for the dynamical system “magnetic dipole plus 
charged particle”, if the bound EM fields propagate at finite velocity. Hence, an introducing 
of instantaneous action-at-a-distance is strongly indicated. 

3.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  generalized  Umov’s  vector,  describing  an  energy  flux 
density for the bound EM fields, can be obtained from Maxwell’s equations. A corresponding 
momentum-energy stress density tensor for bound EM fields has been proposed. Then a four-
divergence of the tensor of total momentum-energy (in empty space) is vanishing, if and only 
if a mass of bound EM field is included in the total mass of source particles. Then the mo-
tional  equation  of  a  charged  particle  should  be  written  in  the  form  (66).  A  bound  EM  field 
(and associated mass) rigidly moves in space together with a source particle, which is possi-
ble  only  for  elliptic  solutions  of  non-homogeneous  Maxwell’s  equations  (instantaneous  ac-
tion-at-a-distance).  Such  a  source-bound  EM  field  might  be  represented  quantum  mechani-
cally as a cloud of virtual photons not subject to causal limitations.

Appendix  A.  Calculation  of  the  force,  acting  on  a  solenoid  due  to  a  charged  particle, 
moving inside the solenoid 
 
Let at the initial instant t=0 the charged particle q moves inside a tall solenoid at the velocity 
(cid:1)
, lying in the xy-plane (Fig. 5). The radius of the solenoid is equal to r, the distance between 
v
the particle and the axis of solenoid is R<r at t=0. The axis of solenoid is collinear to the axis 
z. One requires to determine the force, experienced by the solenoid, carrying the current i.

Fig.  5.  The  charged  particle  +q  moves  inside  the  solenoid.  We  imagine  a  solenoid  as  two  oppositely  charged 
insolating elongated cylinders with thin walls and equal radius, which rotate without friction at the opposite di-
rections about a common axis and the angular frequency  w. In order to apply the same expressions, like for con-
ductive solenoid, we assume that each cylinder contains N equally charged layers with the charge Q and with n 
layers per unit length. Then the current in each layer is equal to i=Qw/2p. 
 

In the non-relativistic limit a moving charged particle creates the magnetic field 

where  nˆ(cid:1)

Without a lose of generality, we can choose the axis x to be orthogonal to  v

Let a charged particle q orbits in the xy-plane around a tall solenoid S at the constant angular 
frequency w (Fig. 6). The radius of solenoid is equal to r, the distance between the particle 
and axis of solenoid is R>r. The axis of solenoid is collinear to the axis z. Under calculation 
of the force, acting on the solenoid due to the charged particle, we assume that at t=0 the axis 
x is orthogonal to orbital velocity of particle. Then, using designations of Fig. 5, we again ob-
tain Eq. (A9). However, now R>r, and we derive for a single loop

This expression describes the momentary force due to the rotating particle with the negative 
x-coordinate, when the axis x be orthogonal to its orbital velocity. Similar calculations show 
that the y- and z-components of force, defined by Eqs. (A4) and (A5), correspondingly, both 
equal to zero. Hence, Eq. (B4) describes the total momentary force due to the rotating particle 
with the negative x-coordinate, when the axis x be orthogonal to its orbital velocity. It shows 
that the force is directed along the line, joining the axis of solenoid and momentary position 
of the rotating particle. One follows from there that the direction of the force, exerted by the 
particle  on  solenoid,  rotates  together  with  the  particle  at  the  same  angular  frequency  w. 
Hence, the projections of this force change with time for a laboratory observer as

One can see that Eqs. (B5) and (B6), taken together, can be written in the vector form as

For the vector field of solenoid, circulated in the clock-wise direction, we write

Thus, we have shown that the force, acting on the solenoid due to a rotating particle, is equal

with the opposite sign to the total time derivative of the potential momentum  Aq
 for the sys-
tem “solenoid +particle”.

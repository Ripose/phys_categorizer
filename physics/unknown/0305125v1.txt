Abstract-  We  report  on  an  attempt  to  generate  highly  stable  continuous  terahertz  (THz)  wave  by  using
optical  frequency  comb  (OFC).  About  10-nm  wide  OFC  has  been  generated  through  a  deep  phase
modulation  of  a  852  nm  laser  line  in  lithium  niobate  crystal  cavity.  The  multiple  optical  modes  (side
bands) of the OFC, which are equally separated from each other by the modulation frequency (=6 GHz)
are  taken  as  the  frequency  reference.    When  another  semiconductor  laser  is  frequency  locked,  the
stability  of  the  difference  frequency  between  the  master  laser  and  the  second  laser    is  improved  on  the
same  order  of  the  RF  modulator.    An  ultra-narrow  line  and  tunable  THz  radiation  source  can  be
achieved by photomixing of this stable difference-frequency optical beat in a photoconductive antenna.

Generation of submillimeter wavelength (THz)  radiation
through  photomixing,  or  optical-heterodyne  conversion
of  two  single  mode  laser  beams  in  a  photoconductive
antenna [1] is a promising approach in realizing  a  stable
and 
radiation  source.  The  stability
(linewidth) and tunability of this kind of radiation source
is mostly determined by those of the optical pump source.
Semiconductor 
the
excitation  laser  source  because  of  its  wide  tunability,
compactness, and the ease for the operation.  In addition,
the advanced diode  laser  technology  is  already  available
at  hand.    For  example,  two  external  grating-stabilized
diode lasers were used as the photomixing source, and a
wide tunability (0.6-3.2 THz) and a linewidth of  ~5 MHz
was  achieved  [2].    A  Fabry-Perot  cavity  was  used  to
further stabilize the diode lasers, and a linewidth about 1
MHz was achieved [3].  The Fabry-Perot cavity shows a
optical frequency comb in transmission spectrum, whose
mode  separation  corresponds  to  the  FSR  (Free  Spectral
Range) of the cavity.   However, the linewidth of a mode
(D
),  which  is  determined  by  the  finesse  of  the  Fabry-
Perot  cavity  (D
=FSR/finesse),  1is  usually  on  a  MHz
order. The modes in such a passive optical device are also
subject to mechanical and temperature instabilities.

With  the  recent  advancement  in  the  opto-electronics  we
can now generate an optical  frequency comb  by a deep
phase  modulation  of  a  continuous-wave  (cw)  laser  beam
[4].    For  example,  some  of  the  co-authors  demonstrated
an  optical  frequency  comb  generation  with  a  bandwidth

The OFC is a result of a deep phase modulation of a laser
beam  and  consists  of  many  sidebands  around  the  carrier
line  due  to  the  phase  modulation.    It  is  equivalent  to
phase  modulated    (or  phase  locked)  pulses,  whose
repetition

modulation frequency (twice of it).  Once such an OFC is
achieved,  a  second  laser  can  be  frequency  or  phase
locked  to  one  of  the  OFC  sideband.  The  difference
frequency  between  the  second  laser  and  the  master  laser
used for OFC (or a third laser locked to a different mode
of  the  OFC)  is  stabilized  to  the  order  of  the  stability
obtained  by  the  RF  modulator,  for  which  a  stability  of
  =  10-10  is  easily  achieved.    In  addition  to  the  good
stability, the absolute difference frequency (n dif) can also
be determined by the mode difference number (k) and the
off-set frequency of the laser line to a mode of the OFC
(n offset): n dif = n offset + kn mod, where n mod is the modulation
frequency.    The  mode  difference  number  k  can  be
determined  from  the  relation  that  D

mod  is  the  variation  in  the  modulation  frequency  and
dif  is  the  change  in  the  difference  frequency  (both  are

The  narrow  line  and  tunable  THz  radiation  source  is
desired  for  the  high-resolution  molecular  spectroscopy,
because  the  vibrational  and  rotational  transition  in
molecules or molecular radicals are observed  in the THz
frequency range.  In astro-physics, there is a big demand
for  a  compact  and  stable  THz  local  oscillator  for  the
heterodyne  detection  of  millimeter  and  submillimeter
wavelength  radiation,  for  example,  in  VLBI  [6]  or
satellite observatories for precise positioning of heavenly
bodies  and  spectroscopy  of  interstellar  molecular  gases,
respectively.

II. : OPTICAL FREQUENCY COMB GENERATOR (OFCG)

A  852-nm  diode  laser  beam  is  phase  modulated  in  a
lithium  niobate  (LiNbO3)  crystal  with  a  monolithic
Fabry-Perot cavity.  One of the cavity mirrors is a plane
mirror and the other is a spherical mirror with a radius of
curvature  of  50  mm.    Details  of  the  OFCG  can  be
obtained in [7]. In our experiment the crystal length is 22
mm (along z-axis) with two high reflecting mirrors at the
two  ends  whereas  gold  electrodes  are  deposited  on  two
side surfaces normal to the c-axis. At 852-nm wavelength
the  refractive 
through  a
Sellmeier equation and experimental data are 2.2410 and
2.2465,  respectively.  Thus,  the  obtained  FSR  is  3.03
GHz.  Power  reflectivity  of  the  mirrors  is  99.6  %.  With
this crystal cavity, a 10-watt  RF  power  at  6.06  GHz  has
been  applied  to  phase  modulate  the  laser  beam.    A
number of frequency sidebands are  generated, which can
briefly be described by the following equation in an ideal
condition,

The stability of the RF oscillator is 2x10-7.  This gives a
RF frequency linewidth of 1.2 kHz at 6 GHz, which was
confirmed  by  measuring  the  RF  signal  at  6.06  GHz  as
shown  in  Fig.  1(b).    The  stability  of  an  optical  beat
between  two  modes  in  OFC  is  estimated  from  this  RF
oscillator stability.  For mode difference D k=100, the beat
frequency is 606 GHz and the linewidth of the beat node
is expected to be 121 kHz.

III. LASER STABILIZATION

We  used  two  external-cavity  diode  lasers  with  a  grating
mirror on one end (Littrow mount), both of which can be
tuned  at  around  852  nm.  The  first  laser  (LD1),  that  is
used  for  OFC  generation,  has  been  frequency  stabilized
with  a  reference  Fabry-Perot  cavity.  The  finesse  of  the
cavity  is  about  530  (FSR  ~10  GHz).  A  low  voltage
modulation  is  given  to  a  PZT  element  on  one  of  the
cavity  mirrors,  and  transmission  of  the  beam  is  detected
by  a  photodetector.  This  signal  has  been  used  to
frequency stabilize the LD1. This stabilization scheme is
shown  in  Fig.  2.  Since  the  RF  oscillator  frequency
stability (D
, the difference frequency noise
at the laser line (852 nm) of the first sideband will be the
same as the RF frequency stability and is expected to be
about  1  kHz.  For  the  165-th  order  sideband  that
corresponds  to  about  1  THz  frequency  separation  from
the carrier frequency (352 THz), the frequency noise will
be  about  165  kHz  in  an  ideal  case.  This  noise  will  be
reflected in the emitted THz radiation as well.

A  schematic  diagram  of  the  system  for  offset  locking  is
shown in Fig. 2. At the photodiode PD2 a beat frequency
is  generated,  which  corresponds 
the  frequency
separation  between  the  LD2  and  one  of  the  OFC
sideband. Since the estimated power of the 5 th sideband
of  the  OFC  is  only  2.6  m W,  a  higher  power  of  the  LD2
beam (about 5 mW out of 80 mw total power) is used to
generate more intense beat signal. According to equation
below  the  intensity  of  the  beat  signal  depends  on  power
of both the difference frequency components:

~75m W beat signal is expected to be generated at the PD2
photodiode,  which  is  then  amplified  through  a  30-dB
preamplifier  to  detect  the  signal  by  a  RF  spectrum
analyzer.  This amplified beat signal is tuned to about 95
MHz  by  the  PZT  actuator  mounted  to  the  feed  back
grating  of  the  LD2.  Using  a  100-MHz  local  oscillator
with a –30-dBm output power, an intermediate frequency
between  the  beat  signal  and  the  local  oscillator  is
generated in a double balanced mixer (DBM).  The signal
of  the  intermediate  frequency  from  the  DBM  is  then
passed  through  an  IF-voltage  converter  and  low  noise
amplifier before feeding it to a lock in amplifier (LIA).

Unfortunately, one of the lasers had a break-down during
the experiment.  The spectrum of the THz radiation is not
available yet at this stage of our experiment. The data for
the  THz  radiation  spectrum  will  be  presented  at  the
Conference.

V. SUMMARY

We have demonstrated stabilization of  two lasers for its
relative  frequency  difference  by  using  an  optical
frequency  comb.    With  this  laser  system  an  optical  beat
and thus THz frequency radiation with the same stability
of  the  RF  oscillator  used  is  achievable  through  the
photomixing  in  a  photoconductive  antenna.    Ultimate
frequency  stability  better  than  1  kHz  is  feasible  at  THz
frequencies by using a RF oscillator with a stability of 10-
10 (already commercially available) and the phase locking
of the lasers to the OFC.  The advantages of this system,
in  addition  to  the  stability,  are  the  tunability  and  the
relative  ease  in  determining  the  absolute  frequency,
which  can  be  calculated  from  the  number  of  mode
difference and the off-set frequency.

Discordant  alternans,  the  phenomenon  of  separate  cardiac  tissue  locations

exhibiting action potential duration (APD) alternans of opposite phase, appears to be

a  potential  mechanism  for  electrocardiographic  T  wave  alternans,  but  its  initiation

mechanism  is  unknown.    We  studied  behavior  of  one-  and  two-  dimensional

cardiac tissue spatially homogeneous in all respects, including APD restitution and

conduction  velocity  restitution,  using  the  Beeler  Reuter  ion  channel  model.    We

found that discordant alternans were initiated when spatial gradients of APD arose

dynamically, such as from fixed rate pacing of a cable end (sinus node scenario), or

from fixed rate pacing at one site preceded by a single excitation wavefront from

another site (ectopic focus scenario).  In the sinus node scenario, conduction velocity

restitution was necessary to initiate discordant alternans.  Alternating regimes of

concordant and discordant alternans arose along the length of the cable, with

regimes delimited by nodes of fixed APD.  The number of observable nodes

depended upon pacing rate and tissue length.  Differences in beat to beat conduction

velocity values at steady state were small.  In the ectopic focus scenario, variable

conduction velocity was not required for induction of discordant alternans.  In both

scenarios, stability of node position was dependent upon electrotonic coupling.

Other  mathematical  models  produced  qualitatively  similar  results.    We  conclude

that spatial inhomogeneities of electrical restitution are not required to produce

discordant alternans;  rather, discordant alternans can arise dynamically from

interaction of APD and conduction velocity restitution with single site pacing, or

from APD restitution alone in two site pacing.

Introduction

Occurrences of electrocardiographic T wave alternans (TWA) were noted

soon after the first electrocardiograms were published 90 years ago, but such overt

TWA was rare enough to elicit case reports [1].  Overt TWA was frequently

associated with profibrillatory conditions such as angina, acute myocardial ischemia

[reviewed in 2] and long QT syndrome [3].  Recent advances in signal processing

techniques  have  led  to  the  ability  to  detect  microscopic  (microvolt  level)  TWA  from

the body surface [4] and to the discovery that microscopic TWA is a fairly common

phenomenon  at  higher  heart  rates.    Clinical  studies  show  a  high  correlation

between large amplitude microscopic TWA and sudden cardiac arrest [5, 6].

Commercial  instruments  can  now  quantify  microscopic  TWA  in  cardiology  offices,

and one such test was cleared by the FDA last year as the first non-invasive test to

identify patients at risk for sudden cardiac death [7].

Many  experimental  studies  have  been  conducted  to  elucidate  the  mechanism

of electrocardiographic alternans.  Some have focused on alternans of action

potential duration (APD) and mechanical contraction [reviewed in 8] that occurs at

fast heart rates.  Others have studied the correlation between alternans and ischemia

[reviewed in 2], or long QT syndrome [3, 9, 10].  A recent optical mapping study by

Pastore et al strongly suggests that TWA is related to discordant alternans (two

spatially discrete sites exhibiting APD alternans of opposite phases) [11], a

phenomenon  described  previously  between  epicardial  and  endocardial

electrocardiograms [12].  The purpose of our study was to describe the origins of

discordant  alternans  in  spatially  homogeneous  cardiac  tissue,  using  mathematical

modeling  and  non-linear  dynamics  theory.    Previous  theoretical  work  has  already

suggested that sustained APD alternans [13] arises when the slope of APD restitution

(the dependence of APD on duration of electrical diastole, i.e., diastolic interval or

DI) is greater than 1.

Methods

A discrete model was used to illustrate initiation mechanisms of discordant

alternans.  It was composed of a 100 cell cable with cell-cell distance of 0.0375 mm,

and no electrotonic coupling.  Each cell adhered to the APD restitution equation

APD [ms] = 300-250*exp(-DI/100) and to the intercellular conduction velocity

restitution equation CV [mm/ms] = 0.025-0.02*exp(-DI/40) or = 0.025.  To simulate

long  term  behavior  of  discordant  alternans,  we  used  the  Beeler  Reuter  (BR)  ion

channel model [14] in a cable or a sheet of cardiac cells.  We used the forward Euler

method to solve the partial differential equations, with step-sizes of 0.25 mm and

0.02 ms.  Restitution of APD and conduction velocity (dependence of conduction

velocity on DI) are both monotonically increasing curves in the BR model [15].  To

confirm validity of results from the BR model, we also analyzed discordant

alternans in the Noble ion channel model [16] and in 2- and 3- variable models in

which restitution parameters could be varied [15, 17].  Figures 1 and 2 are from the

discrete model, all others are from the BR model.

Results

Basic  mechanisms  of  discordant  alternans  initiation

Initiation of discordant alternans requires two conditions to be met, an APD

restitution slope greater than 1 at the stimulus site, which allows sustained APD

alternans at that site, and an initial spatial variation of DI.  Initial variation of DI

can be produced even in absence of spatial heterogeneity of APD and conduction

velocity restitution curves.  To illustrate, we will use a standard geometrical

technique called cobwebbing (figure 1).  Drawing a vertical line from the x axis to the

restitution curve APD = f(DI) gives an APD value for a given DI.  If time between

stimuli is S1S1, then new DI = S1S1 - old APD.  Therefore, new DI can also be

obtained graphically by drawing a horizontal line from the coordinates (old DI, old

APD) on the restitution curve until it intersects the auxiliary line DI + APD= S1S1 at

5

(new DI, old APD).  This process of drawing a vertical line to the restitution curve

and a horizontal line to the auxiliary line, can be repeated indefinitely to produce

sequential DI, APD values.  The intersection of the restitution curve and auxiliary

line is called the fixed point (DI*, APD*), because the DI and APD are fixed in time at

that point.  The cobwebbing technique shows that if initial DI < DI*, then the

subsequent DI and APD are always longer than the current values (a short-long

sequence), and conversely, if initial DI > DI*, then the next DI and APD are always

shorter (a long-short sequence).  I.e., any spatial gradient of DI in which DI values

flank DI* must produce discordant alternans.

Two  scenarios  of  discordant  alternans  initiation

The laddergrams in figure 2 show two scenarios for producing initial DI

gradients.  In the ectopic focus scenario (figure 2A), we assumed that the tissue was

excited uniformly before the first S1 stimulus (S11), and that depolarization

wavefronts  traveled  with fixed  velocity,  making  time  from  depolarization  to

depolarization 290 ms everywhere along the cable.  At the stimulus site, the first DI

was 62 ms (white space).  APD (grey space) was then 165 ms from f(62)=165.  The

second DI was 125 from 290-165=125.  The second APD was then f(125)=228.  The

third DI was 290-228=62, identical to the initial DI, proving the sequence would

repeat itself stably.  Farther from the stimulus site, the fact that the wavefront could

not travel instantaneously to other sites gave rise to longer DI with distance

traversed.  Increasing DI produced increasing APD.  This in turn led to a reversal in

spatial distribution of DI when the wavefront from S12 travelled down the cable.

Therefore,  at  the  stimulus  site,  APD  alternated  with  a  short-long-short-long

sequence, while at the bottom end of the cable, the same stimuli produced a long-

short-long-short sequence, or discordant alternans.  Cell 19, where DI equaled DI*,

separated the concordant and discordant alternans regimes.  Below the bottom edge

of the laddergram, conduction block occurred when APD grew to equal S1S1.

6

With sufficient time, APD values came to alternate between 165 and 228 ms

for cells 0-18, and cells 20-100 with different phases, while cell 19 remained at APD*.

This unphysiological end state of a sharp 63 ms APD difference between two cable

segments was due to absence of electrotonic coupling in this discrete model.

In the sinus node scenario, similar to the stimulation protocol of ref [11],

stimuli were introduced following long quiescence (figure 2B).  There was only one

pacemaker site, but conduction velocity was allowed to vary with DI.  Short DI (2

ms) produced by S12 at cell 1 produced slow conduction.  Slow conduction gave rise

to longer DI as the wavefront traveled down the cable, which in turn sped up

conduction and shortened DI, thereby producing sinusoidal DI gradients.  The

conduction  velocity  restitution  itself  produced  the  initial  variation  of  DI,  which

spanned the DI* of 91 ms.  APD node position where the APD was identical for two

consecutive beats gradually moved towards the stimulus end.  For example, the first

node formed just beyond cell 100 and node APD value was approximately 167 ms.

The node was next seen at cell 49, with node APD value of 207.  Subsequent nodes

were seen at cells 35 and 28 respectively.  The remainder of the results section

describes the dynamics of discordant alternans in this sinus node initiation scenario,

using  the  BR  model.

Spatial  gradients  of  APD,  cycle  length  and  conduction  velocity

APD gradients evolve in time.  How the gradients grow in magnitude until

the even and odd beat gradients intersect is shown in figure 3  for a cable length of

80mm, basic cycle length (BCL) of 310 ms.  The intersection (node) asymptotically

approaches a location near the pacing site.  The final state is shown in figure 5A.

Figure 4 shows the steady state distribution of voltage over the length of a 1-D

cable for a full alternans cycle, at a BCL of 310 ms, for two cable lengths.  The vertical

axis is time, so rotating these figures 90 degrees clockwise produces the laddergram

orientation.  The voltage tracings in the left panel exhibit several features.  The two

7

depolarization  wavefronts  look  roughly  linear,  similar  to  the  laddergram,  indicating

that fluctuation of conduction velocity is relatively small.  APD and DI can be

visualized from high voltage and low voltage segments along the vertical axis

separated by densely apposed voltage traces.  The upstroke of the tenth voltage trace

from the bottom shows the approximate location where APD is fixed in time.  To

the left of this position, APD alternates concordantly with the stimulus end, and to

the right, discordantly.  It is important to note that some of the voltage distributions

exhibit  a  minimun  and  maximum.    The  significance  of  this  phenomenon  is

discussed later in relation to electrotonic interactions.  The right panel shows

voltage distribution when 3 nodes exist at steady state.

Figures 5 A-C show even and odd steady state APD gradients for 3 different

tissue lengths at a BCL of 310 ms.  There are 1, 2 and 3 nodes for cables of length 80,

117.5 and 135 mm, respectively.  Multiple nodes imply alternating regimes of

concordant and discordant alternans.  If a node exists for a particular tissue length, it

occurs at the same position regardless of cable length.  However, the cable must be

considerably longer than where a node is expected, for the node to exist at all.  E.g.,

there is only one node for the 80 mm cable, although judging from the 117.5 mm

cable, two nodes might be expected.  This is because the node first arises where the

spatial APD gradients cross, moves in the direction of the stimulus site, and

becomes fixed in position.  Even though a node can exist or "fit" in a particular

length of tissue, the tissue has to be long enough for the node to be born.  Where the

node is born depends on the conduction velocity restitution curve.  E.g., increased

conduction  velocity  moves  the  initial  APD  node  position  farther  from  the  stimulus

site, and slope must not be zero for the gradients to cross.

Figures 5 C-E show the relationship between steady state APD, cycle length,

and conduction velocity gradients for a cable length of 135 mm.  At the APD nodes,

cycle length alternates by approximately 6 ms.  At the cycle length nodes where cycle

length is fixed, APD alternates, replicating the condition at the stimulated end of the

cable.  Conduction velocity nodes are closely but not exactly aligned with the APD

8

nodes, and alternate by approximately 50 mm/s.

Relationship  between  BCL  and  node  position  and  number

In experiments [11], shortening BCL causes concordant tissue to become

discordant.  The division of length, BCL parameter space into regions of 0

(concordant) through 4 node alternans in  figure 6A illustrates  a  mechanism  for  this

phenomenon.  Above a BCL of 320 ms, there is no permanent alternans of APD at

the stimulus site.  Below a BCL of 280 ms, stimulus rate is high and produces

refractory block of every other stimulus.  BCL between these two threshold values

produces stable alternans of APD at the stimulus site, and concordant or multi-

nodal discordant alternans in the tissue as a whole.  As tissue length increases, more

nodes can exist for a given BCL.  For a fixed tissue length, the number of nodes can

increase by one as BCL is shortened.  E.g., at a tissue of length 30 mm, alternans is

concordant at or above a BCL of 290 ms.  Shortening BCL to 285 ms or lower

produces one node, i.e., one region of discordant alternans, similar to experiments.

Electrocardiograms computed from an electrode placed above the center of a 30 mm

cable for BCL of 290 and 285 ms are shown at the bottom of the figure.  Both

electrocardiograms show some alternans of QRS.  The lower electrocardiogram

exhibits  T  wave  alternans.

Figure 6B shows steady state APD node position versus BCL for a cable length

of 140 mm.  Nodes move closer to the paced end of the cable and internodal

distances shrink as cycle length is reduced.

Restitution  curve  during  alternans

The outer graph in Figure 7 shows the relationship between the standard

restitution curve of the BR model (dotted line) and the two DI, APD relationship

curves that arise dynamically during discordant alternans.  Both of the dynamic

9

curves are lower than the standard restitution curve for most DI, and higher for a

small range of short DI.  A particular DI value can produce two APD values, as

shown by the curling ends of the dynamic restitution curves.  The split of the

dynamic curves shows why DI can alternate, yet still produce the same APD.  The

inset  similarly  shows  standard  and  dynamic  conduction  velocity  restitution  curves.

It is important to note that the different dynamic restitution curves do not signify an

a priori  spatially  heterogenous  distribution  of  restitution  curves,  but  a  dynamic

modulation  of  inherent  restitution  properties  by  electrotonic  coupling.

2-D  simulation  and  results  from  other  models

Figure 8  shows temporal evolution of APD gradient for alternate beats in a 2-

dimensional sheet in the sinus node scenario.  The APD node line, where APD was

identical on consecutive beats, moved towards and stabilized near the pacing site.

APD gradient on the diagonal line of the 2-D sheet is shown at the bottom.

Simulations of discordant alternans in other models [15-17] produced results

qualitatively  similar  to  simulations  from  the  BR  model,  demonstrating  the

robustness  of  mechanisms  of  initiation  and  evolution  across  different  models.    One

quantitative difference was noted.  In the BR model, QRS alternans and T wave

alternans  arose  simultaneously,  due  to  similar  DI  over  which  APD  and  conduction

velocity  restitution  had  large  slopes,  while  in  the  other  models,  T  wave  alternans

could precede QRS alternans with rate increase.

Discussion

The first condition that must be satisfied to initiate discordant alternans is to

have non-transient alternans at the pacing site.  In theory, a restitution curve with a

maximum slope greater than 1 will produce stable alternation of APD for some

range of BCL [13,18,19], although there are experiments showing some discrepancy

from theory [20], and some experimental [21,22] and theoretical [23] results ascribe a

more  important  role  to  slope  of  dynamic  rather  than  standard  restitution  curve  in

10

alternans  production.    The  APD  restitution  curve  of  the  BR  model  has  a  maximum

slope that is greater than 1, and stable alternans was produced at the pacing site in

accordance with theory.  Steep (>1) restitution curve slope has also been shown to

produce spiral wave break-up [15,24] in mathematical models, a phenomenon

believed to be an analog for ventricular fibrillation.  The slope of restitution curve is

thus  an  indirect  link  between  ventricular  fibrillation  and  alternans,  and  may  be

related  to  the  close  relationship  between  TWA  and  ventricular  fibrillation.

The second condition necessary to produce discordant alternans was a non-

uniform initial distribution of DI in space.  We found two ways to accomplish this

in electrically homogeneous tissue.  In the ectopic focus scenario, conduction

velocity could be fixed, but required two stimulus sites (figure 2A).  That situation is

analogous in a 2 dimensional system to a straight edge depolarization wavefront

coming from one direction, followed by straight edge depolarization wavefronts

coming from a second direction, such as would happen when a sinus beat is

followed by beats from a regularly firing ectopic focus, or the case where a

ventricular premature contraction is followed by sinus beats.  In the sinus node

scenario, conduction velocity restitution produced spatial gradients of DI with only

one  stimulus  site.

The boundary between discordant and concordant alternans was represented

by nodes where APD was identical on two consecutive beats.  In the sinus node

scenario, nodes formed, gradually moved towards the stimulus site, and stopped at a

distance determined by BCL and cable length.  Multiple nodes indicated multiple

regimes in space where the phase of APD alternans was alternately concordant or

discordant with the phase at the stimulated end.  The number of nodes seen

depended on tissue length.  Although only single nodes have been observed

experimentally [11], the simulation predicts that more may be found if larger tissue

sizes are studied.  Simulations replicated the experimental observation of faster

11

pacing  converting  concordant  to  discordant  alternans.

During discordant alternans, there was alternans not only of APD, but of DI,

cycle length, and conduction velocity.  The relative importance of APD alternans

and conduction velocity alternans has been debated, with some giving alternans of

conduction velocity the primary role [25] and others, alternans of APD [26-28].  Two

recent studies support primacy of APD alternans; activation times were identical

from beat to beat [29, 30].  The results of our simulations show that both APD and

conduction velocity alternans are important.  It is possible that the magnitude of

conduction velocity alternans is too small (50 mm/s compared to an overall velocity

of 450 mm/s) to produce measurable differences of activation time in experiments.

The  difference  of  the  dynamic  restitution  curves  from  the  standard

restitution curve was found to be due to electrotonic coupling of cardiac tissue.  This

is best explained by studying Figure 4.  When DI is very short, a minimum appears

in the spatial distribution of voltage with the next depolarization.  APD at the

voltage  minimum  is  longer  than  expected  from  the  restitution  curve,  because

electrotonic  current  flows  towards  the  minimum,  keeping  voltage  elevated.

Conversely, when DI is long, a maximum appears in the spatial distribution of

voltage with the next depolarization.  APD at the voltage maximum is shorter than

expected from the restitution curve, because electrotonic current flows away from

the  maximum.

The split between the two dynamic curves themselves was also found to be

due to electrotonic coupling.  There existed an asymmetry of electrotonic coupling

with respect to propagation direction for a given APD gradient.  For example,

consider three adjacent segments in a cable, a, b, and c, with DI-dependent APD

values  APDa, APDb, and APDc, in the uncoupled state.  If the excitation sequence is

a -> b -> c, segment a supplies electrotonic current during its phases 1-3 to segment b,

while segment c supplies electrotonic current during its phases 0-3 to segment b.  If

12

the excitation sequence were reversed, segment b would receive phase 1-3 current

from  segment  c and phase 0-3 current from segment a.  The sum of electrotonic

currents passing from segments a and c to segment b during APDb is therefore

different  depending  on  depolarization  direction,  even  if  the  uncoupled  scalar  values

APDa and APDc remain the same.  This asymmetry can be quantified rigorously,

and is part of a separate manuscript in progress.  The split of dynamic restitution

curves due to electrotonic coupling is directly responsible for stability of APD node

position,  and  therefore  of  discordant  alternans.

Based on our results, we expect that spatial heterogeneity in the form of

smooth  gradients  of  electrical  restitution  would  not  change  initiation  and  evolution

characteristics of discordant alternans.  However, effects of discontinuous tissue

heterogeneities such as non-conducting scar tissue require further study.

In summary, discordant alternans arises from the simple cardiac tissue

characteristics of APD restitution and conduction velocity restitution.  It does not

require spatially heterogeneous tissue properties.  Previous theory predicts that

concordant alternans could be prevented by reducing heart rate, or alternatively by

reducing APD restitution curve slope, such as by calcium channel antagonists [21,30

and references therein].  Results from the present study suggest that discordant

alternans, and by inference, TWA, might be prevented by pharmacological agents

that  reduce  conduction  velocity  restitution  slope,  even  in  presence  of  alternans.

Figure 2.  Laddergrams showing two scenarios of discordant alternans initiation.

The vertical axis represents 100 cells of a cable, and the horizontal axis represents

time.  Stimuli were applied at the top end of the cable.  Bands of white and grey

depict electrical diastole and action potential respectively.  Boxed numerical values

indicate DI and APD.  Bold lines depict depolarization wavefronts.  Computation of

DI and APD was independent of values at adjacent points, i.e., lacked electrotonic

effects.  A:  Ectopic focus scenario.  The entire cable had depolarized and repolarized

before S11.  Conduction velocity was fixed, but increasing DI with distance from

stimulus end provided the DI gradient necessary for discordant alternans initiation.

B:  Sinus node scenario.  The cable was in quiescence before S11.  Conduction

velocity restitution provided the DI gradient necessary for discordant alternans

initiation.  The cell number at which APD values (in boxes) were the same for two

consecutive beats gradually decreased during initiation of discordant alternans.

stimulus numbers 2,3 (A), 30, 31 (B), 50, 51 (C) and 150, 151 (figure 5A).  The APD

node  (gradient  intersection)  moved  leftwards  with  increasing  stimulus  number.

Figure 4   Steady state distribution of voltage over a cable for a full alternans cycle at

a BCL of 310 ms, for cable lengths of 80 (left) and 135 mm (right).  Voltage traces are

plotted every 6 ms with upward shift for clarity.  Arrows indicate time of

17

stimulation.

Figure 5   Steady state APD, cycle length, and conduction velocity gradients over a

cable for even (hashed) and odd (solid line) beats.  BCL was 310 ms.  A, B, C: APD

node position and number of APD nodes at 3 cable lengths 80, 117.5 and 135 mm.  C,

D, E: The relationship between APD gradient, cycle length gradient, and conduction

velocity gradients for a cable length of 135 mm.

Figure 6   Relationship between APD node position, number of nodes, BCL, and

cable length at steady state.  A. The parameter space is divided into zero

(concordant), 1, 2, 3 and 4 node regimes.  As cycle length is shortened for a given

cable length, the number of nodes can increase.  Electrocardiograms computed for

BCL of 290 and 285 ms at tissue length of 30 mm are also shown.  B. Node position

as a function of cycle length for cable length of 140 mm.  As cycle length was

reduced, internodal distances decreased.

Figure 7  The relationship between the standard (dotted line) and dynamic

restitution curves during discordant alternans, (hashed line - even, solid line - odd

beats), in a cable 62.5 mm long, for BCL of 305 ms.  Large graph: APD restitution

curves.    Inset:  Magnified  view  of  conduction  velocity  restitution  curves.

Figure 8   APD gradients in an 80 mm x 80 mm 2-dimensional sheet produced by a

point stimulus applied at the bottom left corner every 310 ms.  Left to right - Top

row:  APD gradient for stimulus number 2, 20 and 52.  Center row: APD gradient for

stimulus numbers 3, 21 and 53.  Bottom  row: APD gradients on the diagonal of the

2-D sheets.  The black lines in the 2-d sheets indicate APD node line position where

APD was fixed for consecutive beats.  When stimulation was continued, the APD

node line became a quarter circle (a line equidistant from stimulus site).

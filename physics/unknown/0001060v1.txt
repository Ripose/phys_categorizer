PATHINT is a non Monte Carlo histogram C computer code developed to evolve an n-dimensional

system  (subject  to  machine  constraints)  based  on  a  generalization  of  an  algorithm  demonstrated  by

Wehner  and  Wolfer  to  be  extremely  robust  for  nonlinear  Lagrangians  with  moderate  noise [1-3].

PATHINT was recently used in a neuroscience study [4], where it was observed how difﬁcult it can be

ev en in two dimensions to get good resolution because of CPU constraints on Sun SPARC 2 and 10MP

machines.  Here it appears that the resolution is quite satisfactory on these machines.

The  system  selected  for  this  paper  to  illustrate  the  use  of  PATHINT  is  the  classical  analog  of  a

quantum system. “Quantum chaos” was a term used to describe the observation of chaos in the classical

trajectories of the Hamilton’s equations of motion,

with  a  coefﬁcient D was considered  in  a q dimension ‡ 2,  representing  double  this  dimension  in  the

corresponding phase space of q and p [5].

A slight change of notation is used in this paper. They posed the question as to just what properties such

classical systems might possess?

This paper does not at all deal with the quantum system described above, but it does deal in detail

with  the  associated  classical  system,  and  it  does  give  some  answers  to  the  above  posed  question. This

study should be considered as illustrating a particular numerical approach that promises to be quite useful

in  studying  the  evolution  of  such  classical  systems. The  results  obtained  can  be  considered  as

“experimental” data on the exact region of such classical transformations. The results here are negative

with  respect  to  any unusual  or  interesting  activity  in  the  parameter  region  observed  in  the  quantum

mechanical  calculation. This  should  at  least  help  other  investigators  who  might  tend  to  focus  on  this

region in the classical system, based on the results obtained for the associated quantum system.

This paper computes the path integral of the classical system in terms of its Lagrangian L.

Here  the  diagonal  diffusion  terms  are gxx = gyy = D and  the  drift  terms  are gi = -

If the

diffusions terms are not constant, then there are additional terms [6].

The histogram procedure recognizes that the distribution can be numerically approximated to a high
degree of accuracy by sums of rectangles of height Pi and width D qi at points qi. For convenience, just
consider a one-dimensional system. The above path-integral representation can be rewritten, for each of

its intermediate integrals, as

Tij is a banded matrix representing the Gaussian nature of the short-time probability centered about the

(possibly time-dependent) drift.

This  histogram  procedure  was  extended  to  two dimensions  using  a  matrix Tijkl [7].  Explicit

dependence of L on time t also can be included without complications. Care must be used in developing
the mesh in D qi, which is strongly dependent on the diagonal elements of the diffusion matrix, e.g.,

D qi »

(D

tgii)1/2 .

(8)

This  constrains  the  dependence  of  the  covariance  of  each  variable  to  be  a  (nonlinear)  function  of  that

variable in order to present a straightforward rectangular underlying mesh.

Since  integration  is  inherently  a  smoothing  process [8],  ﬁtting  the  data  with  the  short-time

probability distribution, effectively using an integral over this epoch, permits the use of coarser meshes

than  the  corresponding  stochastic  differential  equation. For example,  the  coarser  resolution  is

appropriate,  as  typically  required,  for  a  numerical  solution  of  the  time-dependent  path  integral.  By

considering the contributions to the ﬁrst and second moments, conditions on the time and variable meshes
- 1, where L is  the  uniform
can  be  derived [1].  The time  slice  essentially  is  determined  by D

t £ L

Lagrangian, respecting ranges giving the most important contributions to the probability distribution P.
Thus D

t is roughly measured by the diffusion divided by the square of the drift.

Such  calculations  are  useful  in  many disciplines,  e.g.,  some  ﬁnancial  instruments [8,9].  Monte

Carlo  algorithms  for  path  integrals  are  well  known  to  have  extreme  difﬁculty  in  evolving  nonlinear

systems  with  multiple  optima [10],  but  this  algorithm  does  very  well  on  such  systems. The  PATHINT

code  was  tested  against  the  test  problems  given in previous  one-dimensional  systems [1,2],  and  it  was

established that the method of images for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions is as accurate

as  the  boundary  element  methods  for  the  systems  investigated.  Two-dimensional  runs  were  tested  by

using cross products of one-dimensional examples whose analytic solutions are known.

Attempts were made to process the same system considered for the quantum case [5].  Therefore,
the  diffusion  was  taken  to  be D = 0. 2. Since  they selected  an  harmonic  oscillator  basis  for  their

eigenvalue  study, is was  assumed  that  natural  boundary  conditions  are  appropriate  for  this  study, and

ranges of x and y were tested to ensure that this was reasonable. A band of three units on each side of the
short-time distribution was sufﬁcient for these runs. For e £ 5, the range of x was taken to be – 3 and the
range of y was taken to be – 6.

A mesh of D

t = 0. 1 was reasonable to calculate the evolution of this system for 0. 1 £

e £ 0. 5. The
quantum study observed chaos at e ‡ 0. 14, but the classical system appears to be very stable with a single
peak  in  its  probability  density  up  through e = 0. 5. The  time  mesh  was  tested  by  performing  several
t = 0. 01 on a Sun SPARC 10MP. All other calculations reported here
calculations at time meshes of D

were performed on a Sun SPARC 2.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show the evolution of the distribution for e = 0.1, t = 10 and 100, i.e., after

100  and  1000  foldings  of  the  path  integral,  respectively. The  distribution  starts  at  single  peaks  at  the
imposed initial condition, a d function at the origin, i.e., x = - 0. 0302 and y = - 0. 0603 with this mesh,

and  swell  out  their  stable  structures  within t < 0. 03.  Note the  stability  over the  duration  of  the
calculation.  A similar stability was noted for e < 0.55, as illustrated in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) for e = 0.3

and 0.5 after 1000 foldings.

For values of e > 0. 5, a mesh of D

t = 0. 05 was used to investigate the onset of instabilities which
were noted for higher e with coarser meshes. To  two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, this ﬁrst occurs at e = 0. 55. As
e increases, so does the peak spread quite early along a diagonal in the evolving distribution.  As the time

of the calculation increased, there was concern that the boundaries were being approached. Therefore, for
these  runs,  the  range  of x was increased  to – 5 and  the  range  of y was increased  to – 10.  Figure 3
illustrates the evolution at time t = 5. 0 (100 foldings) and t = 100 (2000 foldings) with e = 0.55.  Figure 4
illustrates the early structure for e = 0.6 at t = 15 after 300 foldings of D

t = 0. 05.

The PATHINT algorithm utilized here will be used to explore the time evolution of other Fokker-

Planck  systems  in  the  presence  of  moderate  noise. As  mentioned  above, such  problems  arise  in  many

systems ranging from neocortical interactions to ﬁnancial markets.  Also, we can now accurately examine

long-time  correlations  of  chaotic  models  as  multiplicative  noise  is  increased  to  moderate  and  strong

levels;  many chaotic  models  do  not  include  such  levels  of  noise  as  is  found  in  the  systems  they are

attempting  to  model. A project  is  now underway  under  an  award  of  Cray  computer  time  from  the

Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Parallelizing ASA

and PATHINT Project (PAPP) further developing this code for large systems [11].

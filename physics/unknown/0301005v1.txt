Abstract

In 1905 A. Einstein [1], from the experiments of Michelson and Morley in 1887 [2],

enunciates the  light  speed  constancy  principle in the inertial  frames  of  reference.  However,

this principle was pointed by the equations of the electromagnetism of J. C. Maxwell in 1865

[3].  The  prediction  of  the  Maxwell  equations  is  due  to  in  the  most  basic  principle  of  the

science,  the  principle  of  causality,  is  the  reason  of  the  light  speed  constancy.  This  article

shown how, only with the causality principle, we can deduce the properties  of the light. At

the end of the article we used the causality relativistic definition to approach the local action

principle, as well as to solve the paradox that implies the EPR theorem.

Introduction.

The restricted relativity is based on the traditional principles of the classic physics and

the  light  speed  constancy  principle  in  the  inertial  frames  of  reference.  Such  traditional

principles of the classic physics are, basically [4§1]:

1.  The tridimensionality of the longitudinal space.

2.  The existence of the time dimension (together to its absolute character that gives it the

classic physics and to the relative that gives it the relativity).

3.  The existence of continuous physical magnitudes.

4.  The action principle (Principle of Least Action in other authors).

While the first three principles are based on the direct observation, the action principle

is based on the experience, this is, in the accumulation of observations and in the deduction of

common principles for such observations [5§2].

The  first  principle  that  the  experience  teaches  us  is  the  principle  of  causality  [6],

according  to  which  “all  event  are  determined  by  the  history  of  previous  events.  To  these

previous events we called causes and to the event that they determine we called effect." [7].

This article will show how the light speed constancy principle in the inertial frames of

reference can be deduced from the principle of causality applied to the homogeneous spaces.

The  inverse  process,  that  is,  beginning  from  the  light  speed  constancy  and  to  arrive  to  the

causality approaches, is frequent in the texts [8]. However, these developments suppose that

we arrive to a more evident event: the causality, starting from a more “laborious” principle:

the light speed constancy.

If  beginning  from  the  causality  we  can  concluding  the  light  speed  constancy,  this

would imply that the relativity is an innate characteristic of the causality and not necessarily a

posteriori consequence of an experimentation. Although, we do not seek, at all, to subtract the

importance  to  the  experimental  physics  as  inspiration  and  confirmation  or  refutation  of  the

hypotheses of the theoretical physics.

To  show  this  dependence  between  both  principles  (light  speed  constancy  regarding

the  causality)  we  will  begin  defining  the  physical  space,  later  the  homogeneous  space  and

deducing  its  properties  starting  from  its  definition.  Lastly  we  will  apply  the  principle  of

causality in the homogeneous space and we will obtain the light speed constancy principle in

the inertial frames of reference.

At  the  end  of  this  article  we  will  generalize  the  principle  of  causality  to  make  it

compatible  with  a  relativistic  idea  (restricted  or  general),  according  to  this,  the  time

coordinate is in equality with the longitudinal coordinateses. This will help us to understand

the local action principle and to solve the paradox of the EPR theorem.

The physical space.

The physical space is characterized by:

1.  The tridimensionality of the longitudinal space.

2.  The existence of the time.

In a general vision we can observe that, the absolute character that concede the classic

physics  to  the  time,  is  a  particular  case  of  a  relative  time  [8].  We  can  start  from  the

supposition  of  the  time  is  relative  and  if  in  the  coordinate  transformations  and  times,  from

some  reference  frames  to  other,  the  time  always  has  the  same  value  in  all  the  reference

frames, we will conclude that the time is absolute. On the contrary, if we find that the time

also change in the transformation from a reference frame to another, we will conclude that the

time is, indeed, relative.

According to this reasoning, the two previous observations can become in:

1'.  The physical space is formed by  four  dimensions: three  space  dimensions and one  time

dimension.

According  to  this  first  observation  (1’)  the  numeric  set  on  which  is  defined  the

physical  space  will  be  the  Cartesian  product  of  four  real  number  sets  or  a  subset  of  this.

Mathematically, this is symbolized by:

To  Ω  it is called physical system or system simply.

Just as the mathematical analysis teach, in this numeric set we can defined a distance

function between two points [9]. It is said that a function s is a distance between two points
Ω∈YX ,

, which verifies the following properties:

Let  the  covectors  set  { } Ω⊂

(which  defines  to  the  covector  OX )  it  will  be  represented  by 

X =

  [10].  For  the

properties of the distance, the expression (ds)2 is symmetrical, bilineal and defined positive.

In this way, we can write that the distance between two infinitesimally near point X + dX and

the moment we handle real numbers, the complex conjugation is not significant).

As  G   is  symmetrical  and  its  determinant  is  different  to  zero,  the  equation  of

diagonalization 

0=Ι− λG

 is verify for no degenerates values of  λ. That is to say, for the

four vales of the diagonal.

On the other hand if  { }

then, according to the diagonalization theorem [9], the matrix T, formed by the  columns of

the vectors of the basis, verifies the equation:

diagonalized metric.

The homogeneous space.

It  is  said  that  a  physical  system  is  homogeneous  when  “the  value  of  any  physical
magnitude is independent of the 4point of the system where we measure it” 2. Concretely, the

                        
2 Any dictionary defines the homogeneous space as a space in which the physical magnitudes
are  identical  in  any  point  of  the  4space.  That  is  to  say,  their  values  are  constants  and
independents of the point in which we are measured. That is the definition that we use there.
If we want measure a magnitude we used a standard of this magnitude, to compare it with the
magnitude  that  we  want  to  measure  and  to  extract  the  proportion  that  exists  between  the
standard and the  object of the measure.  However, when  we  try  to  apply  this  process  to  the

  then  G  =  constant.  Therefore,  the  components  and  the  diagonalization

values  of  G  are  constant.  That  is  to  say,  when  the  physical  system  is  homogeneous,  the

components  of  the  metric  matrix  and  of  the  diagonal  metric  matrix  are  constant  in  all  the

For tradition we  will denote, in Cartesian coordinates,  to 

0X  as the time coordinate

and to

 as the longitudinal three coordinate of each point of the 4space [12].

For verify the implicit isotropic in the homogeneous systems it is necessary that any

reference  frame,  in  which  G  remains  constant,  produce  the  same  results.  Like  this,  if  we
exchange the space coordinates, for example, the axis X 1 with the X2 , the X2 with the X3 and
the  X3 with the X1, will stay unaffected the homogeneity of the system. Therefore, the space

coordinates in a homogeneous system are interchangeable and the homogeneity of the system

does not alter.

Following this reasoning we will look for the form of the diagonal metric matrix. For

this, let us to analyse what is the meaning  of the  space coordinates  can  be interchangeable.

                                                                            
homogeneous  space  we  find  a  problem.  As  by  definition,  in  the  homogeneous  space,  the
physical magnitudes do not depend of the coordinateses, then the introduction of a magnitude
standard in the system breaks the homogeneity and perturbs our system. In this way, it is not
easy  to  understand  the  characteristics  of  the  homogeneous  space,  because  its  own  concept
annuls  the  existence  of  differentiating  characteristic.  In  the  homogeneous  space  the
magnitudes  are  distributed  in  so  uniform  form  that  it  is  impossible  their  detection.  In  this
way, in the homogeneous space, all the magnitudes possess the same value in all de points,
although  we  cannot know  which  is  this value or  if,  in  fact,  this  value  is  zero.  Since,  in  the
homogeneous space differentiating characters do not exist among a point and another, all the
regions of the system have to be same, independently of the coordinated transformation that
we use to pass from a region to another one.

Let  us  take  the  two  first  longitudinal  coordinateses,  for  example

The principle of causality (1).

The  principle  of  causality  tells  us  that  all  event  is  determined  by  the  history  of  the

previous events. These previous events are called causes and the event which is determine is

called effect [7].

region.

We  will  call  event  to  a  happening  that  fact  in  a  point  of  the  4space  and  we  will

represent  it  for  the  coordinateses  of  this  4point.  According  to  the  principle  of  causality,  an

event, in a region of the space, will be integrated by the punctual events that it contains the

The  observation  of  the  principle  of  causality  is  so  essential  because  it  is  verify

independently  of  the  referencial  frame  that  we  use.  That  is  to  say,  if  an  event  is  cause  of

another one in a frame, it will be in any other frame, too.

Applying this observation in the homogeneous4 space we can find the relationship that

some concepts.

So that an event is cause of another, it is necessary that, when it is produce the second

event, this "has had news" of the first one. That is to say, the information referred to the first

event  should  have  arrived  to  the  4point  where  the  second  event  will  produce,  before  this

second event produce it.

So that the principle of causality was verified in any reference frame, this fact should

be  independent  of  the  coordinated  system  that  we  use,  that  is  to  say,  the  interval  or

4dimensional  distance  between  two  events  are  constant  and  independent  of  the  reference

frame.

                        
4  Although  in  a  homogeneous  system  cannot  be  given  events  because,  the  differentiating

singularity of these, would break the homogeneity of the system. We are not interested in the

events in their self, but in the causal relationship among the events. For this, we can be strict

and to consider the events outside of our homogeneous space.

Now,  we  have  a  clear  relationship  between  the  space  dimensions  and  the  time

dimension. To analyze the physical consequences of the principle of causality is necessary to

define the concept of 3-distance or longitudinal distance, 3-speed or three-dimensional speed

and 3-speed of the information.

Let  us  two  events  A  and  B  such  that,  when  the  signal  of  the  event  A  arrives  to  the

three-dimensional coordinateses of B is when the event B takes place. Under these conditions

the  longitudinal  distance  from  A  to  B  is  similar  to  linf  and  the  time  from  A  to  B  is

As ds2, (dx0)2 and (dl)2 are lineal in the homogeneous systems and when A tend to B

From (4) we can conclude several important results:

1.  As  in  the  homogeneous  space  λ   and 

λ   are  constant,  the  three-dimensional  speed  to

0

which the signals (information) propagate is the same in all the frames in which the space

is keep homogeneous. To these frames we called it inertial frames.

2.  The second result tells us that the signs (plus/minus) of  λ and 

λ  are contrary. That is to

0

say, if in our units system the magnitude of the signal (information) speed is the unit, then

λλ =−
0

. As making c equal to the unit does not determine the units system completely

but only the relationship between the time unit and the space one, then we  will even be

able to find the units system in which 

=−

λλ
0

=

1

.

3.  Lastly, the interval between two events which three-dimensionally distance is the distance

that cover the signal (information) from one to the events to the other one, is similar to

zero. That is to say sAB = 0

In this form, according to the point number 2, the metric of the  homogeneous  space

has the form:

This metric matrix is called Minkowski metric [13] and the space invested  with this

metric is called Minkowski space.

However,  the  expression 

  that  we  have  used  pose  a  problem.  The  interval,

λλ =−
0

between two any points in the 4space, does not behave like a distance in the all space (since it

does  not  verify  the  property  I  of  the  distance),  but  only  for  points  of  a  certain  region.

Therefore,  the  physical  space  is  not,  in  the  mathematical  sense,  a  metric  space,  but  a

pseudometric space.

Regarding  the  signal  (information)  speed  for  an  homogeneous  space  we  should

observe  that,  if  when  a  signal  crosses  the  space  it  breaks  the  homogeneity,  then  it  cannot

complete the condition of constancy of the signal speed. This constancy is only valid in case

the space remains homogeneous.

If  to  transmit  a  signal  we  send  a  particle  that  possesses  a  magnitude  like  mass  or

charge  through  a  homogeneous  space,  the  space  loses  its  homogeneity  and  therefore  the

speed of the particle will not be a constant.

For transmit information and that the space does not lose the homogeneity, we need to

use a signal that does not possess physical magnitudes, such as mass or charge. In this case,

the signal will travel to an uniform speed for any inertial frame. To the signal that verify  this

characteristic it is called light. The energy that transport its particles without mass is its own

undulate  vibration  and  the  spin  is  not  more  than  a  intrinsic  property  no  susceptible  of

variation (as the photon does not have charge, the spin does not produce gyro magnetic field).

When a signal of light crosses a homogeneous space, this continues being homogeneous. If

we make discharge the  energy  that  contained  the  signal  of  light  on  an  object,  evidently  we

break up the homogeneity with the object in question and the signal loses its uniform speed,

however, during the time that was traveling the signal, as it did not break the homogeneity of

the space, its speed could keep constant.

All that we have said until here is valid for any homogeneous space. A very important

case of homogeneous space is the vacuum space.  In the vacuum  space  it  will  be  verify  the

constancy of the signals for the inertial frames, too. It is the call principle of constancy of the

light speed in the vacuum [1].

The Minkowski space

For  a  point  P,  the  Minkowski  space,  just  as  we  have  defined  it,  is  divided  in  three

regions [12]:

1.  {X / s(P, X) > 0} temporal region: an object with mass can go from P to any point of this

region. s (P, X ) behaves like a distance for any value of X. To this interval we call it time

interval.

2.  {X  /  s  (P,  X  )  =  0}  light  cone:  only  the  light  signal  can  go  from  P  to  any  point  of  this

region. s (P, X )  does not behave like a distance. To this interval we call it null interval.

3.  {X / s (P, X) < 0} space region: an object with mass cannot accelerate to go from P to the

X point. However, s (P, X) behaves like a distance, with negative values, for any value of

X. To this interval we call it space interval.

According to this, the light cone is a authentic frontier. As the concept of interval is

not an authentic 4dimensional distances, the mathematical analysis of a system that contains

one part in each Minkowski region forces to make the analysis of the system from a  previous

4point which contains all the system in the same region. This fact will be the key to solve the

paradox of the EPR theorem.

The  form  in  which  transform  the  coordinateses  between  two  inertial  frames,  in  the

Minkowski space, is obtained in the following form: Two inertial frames is characterized by,

The principle of causality (2).

Until here we have based on two principles:

1'.  The  physical  space  is  formed  by  four  dimensions:  three  space  dimensions  and  a  time

dimension.

2.  The  principle  of  causality  tells  us  that  all  event  comes  determined  by  the  history  of

previous  events.  These  previous  events  are  called  causes  and  to  the  event  which  they

determine is called effect.

and in a definition:

3.  It  is  said  that  a  physical  system  is  homogeneous  when  the  value  of  any  physical

magnitude is independent of the 4point of the system where we measure it.

The principle 1 ' is the unification of two previous principles which we have applied a

generalization. This generalization consists on supposing that the time is a coordinate that is

on equal footing with the three longitudinal coordinateses.

It  is  clear  that,  in  the  principle  of  causality,  just  as  we  observe  it  here,  this

generalization is not given for the time coordinate. The causality concede to the classification

of the events in function of the time coordinate a bigger importance that to the classification

in function of the space coordinates.

As we just to see, the causal relationship, can enunciate in the form: “Two events A

and  B  can  show  causal  relationship  if  its  interval  is  bigger  or  the  same  as  0”  [12].
Mathematically it would be expressed: A and B are causally connect if (sAB)2 > 0. According

to this, the four coordinateses are in equality with this definition of  causal relation.

But  in  order  that  stay  on  equal  footing,  really,  the  coordinates  space  and  time,  to

determine,  if  A  is  cause  of  B  or  vice  versa,  may  be  an  other  part  than  the  consideration

4positional relative from an event regarding to another one.

It is well-know that, if we take the reference frame 4-centred in A and we observe that
x  0(B) > 0 we will say that A can be cause of B. Reciprocally, if that x  0(B) < 0 we will say

that B can be cause of A.

To observe the relativity of this classification with regard to the time coordinate, we

observe that, we can make these same classifications with regard to another coordinate. If, for
example, x 1(B) > 0 can say that the event B takes place on the right5 from A, and vice versa,
if x 1(B) < 0 will say that B takes place on the left from A.

However,  when  the  interval  between  A  and  B  is  temporal  we  will  find  one  inertial

frame in which B is on the right from A and another frame in which B is on the left from A.

On the other hand, when we say that A can be cause of B, it does not exist one frame in which

this fact can be changed. This should not miss  us  because  it  is the hypothesis that we have

start: "the experience tells us that if A is cause of B it will be in any inertial frames." From

there it arises that in the Minkowski metric the first term of the diagonal has the sign contrary

to the rest of the elements of the diagonal.

It could seem, in a principle that, this fact radically changes the nature of the time in

opposite  of  the  space.  However,  the  last  analysis  that  we  made,  is  not  complete,  (we  have

seen only events separate a time interval) and therefore it is soon to make such affirmation.

                        
5 Right = in positive way of X 1; Left = in negative way of X 1.

When the interval between A and B is space-like, the things change: as (sAB)2 < 0, the

events A and B do not have causal relationship. In some inertial frames A will be previous in

the time to B and in other B will be previous in the time to A. However, the space coordinates

behave in a different form: for  example,  if  in  an  inertial  frame  A  is  on  the  right  from  B,  it

does not exist Lorentz simple transformation to another inertial frame in the one which A is

on the left of B. So that we get this it is necessary to make a rotation of the reference frame so

that during this rotation it leaves off to be inertial.

We  can  make  the  same  reasoning  with  the  time  coordinate.  A  rotation  of  the  frame

that supposes a direction change in the time coordinate will make that, among events causally

connected, the efects become causes and vice versa. This does not contradict our hypothesis

about  the  causality,  since  the  direction  change  in  the  time  requires  a  no  inertial

transformation.

In summary:

1.  If A and B is separated by  a time interval:

a.  The relative temporal position between A and B can NOT change for inertial

transformation. This is called causal relationship.

b.  The  relative  space  position  between  A  and  B  YES  can  change  for  inertial

transformation.

2.  If A and B is separated a space-like interval:

a.  The relative temporal position between A  and B YES can change for inertial

transformation. This would be called absence of causal relationship.

b.  The  relative  space  position  between  A  and  B  can  NOT  change  for  inertial

transformation.

The local action principle.

The  local  action,  enunciated  by  A.  Einstein  and  others  in  1935  [15]  says:  “Two

isolated systems, spatially separate, are independent.”

This  enunciated  is  used  in  the  well-known  theorem  EPR  [15]  according  to  the  one

which: “or the wave function is a maximal representation of the system or it is valid the local

action principle. But both cannot be valid at the same time.”

Here  we  will  show  that  the  local  action  principle  is  not  correct  from  its  current

enunciated, independently of the quantum considerations that we make, because the error is

in its own one enunciated.

If  two  systems  A  and  B  are  independent,  it  is  necessary,  not  only  that  are  causally

unconnected, but something stronger: “it will not exist any systems that has causal connection

so much with A as with B.”  To this system, if exist, we will call it  “common causal origin”.

Be SA the action function that describes to the system A and SB the one that describes

to the system B. A and B are independent means that NO exists a generalized coordinate or

function that it is common to both. That is to say, it does not exist  f such that, at the same

time SA = SA (f) and SB = SB (f).  If it existed this coordinate or function f, this would be the

common  causal  origin.  Therefore,  the  independence  condition  between  both  systems  is  the

same as the condition of that both systems have not a common causal origin.

The  local  action  principle  talk  about  isolated  and  spatially  separate  systems.  Two

systems  spatially  separate  verify  the  condition  about  do  not  have  space  points  in  common.

Two systems are isolated  if  between both  of  there are  not  exchange energy  or  matter.  Two

systems that verify this two qualities can have a common causal origin.

In  the  example  proposed  by  D.  Bohm  [16]  a  singlet  state  of  two  fermions  can

disintegrate in its two constituent particles of half-integral spin with same probabilities each

way  for  have  the  fermion  with  the  positive  or  negative  spin.  When  measuring  one  of  the

particles,  their  wave  function  is  “collapses”  and  automatically  most  be  collapsed  the  wave

function  of  the  other  particle,  so  that,  both  of  they  show  contrary  signs  of  spin.  The

instantaneous collapse of both wave functions assures the conservation of the spin magnitude.

The paradox in this process is: “how can it have travelled the information of the collapse of

the wave functions and its spin value until the other one, even although this can suppose to

travel quicker than the light?.

From the causal point of view do not exist paradox. All the systems that we describe

in our process has common causal connection in some point.

Let us reconstruct the experiment ab initio: In the instant t = 0 a scientist enters in the

laboratory and he decides that he will carry out the experiment of Bohm to check the speed of

the collapse of the wave function. For it, in t = 1 hour he has placed the measure instruments

(two  Stern-Gerlach imams)  and in t =  2 hours  he  has  prepared  the  singlet  system  with  two

fermions, awaiting that the singlet itself disintegrates. In t = 2 hours and 1 minute the singlet

itself  disintegrate,  in  t  =  2  hours,  1  minute  and  0,00001  seconds  both  detectors  take  the

measure of the spin of both particles product of the disintegration and in t = 2 hours, 1minute

and  10  seconds,  the  scientist  reads  the  results  of  both  measures  and  concludes  that  the

collapse of the wave  function  took  place  instantly  in  both  particles,  without  the  light  could

arrive from one to other and coinciding with the measures of the expected results. How can it

explain this from the causal point of view?.

The whole exposed process has a common causally point to all the subsystems. This is

the  instant  t  =  0.  From  that  instant  we  can  isolate  each  subsystem,  we  can  separate  they

spatially,  but  they  will  not  be,  in  strict  sense,  independent  systems.  The  description  of  the

preparation  of  the  singlet  that  disintegrates  is  not  complete  if  we  do  not  bear  in  mind  the

description of the previous steps as they are the placement of the measure instruments or the

facts made by the scientist.

A particle, singlet or quantum system, as system, is described by their action (that will

conduct to  a  wave  function), but  the  complete  system  must  be  contain  the  action  of  all  the

subsystems that have common causally origin. The  action of the system  will be the sum of

the  actions  of  the  particles,  the  measure  instruments,  the  scientist,  and  a  many  more  terms

besides for each subsystem with common causal origin.

In the fact of the measure it is manifested the final result of the sum of the actions of

the  different  subsystems.  When  we  do  not  bear  in  mind  the  rest  of  the  subsystems  that

intervene  in  the  process,  we  are  forced  to  say  that,  in  the  measure,  the  wave  function  is

collapses, but the concept of “collapse” comes to substitute to the: result of the interaction of

all the subsystems with common causal origin that are present in the measure process.

Although  we  argued  that  the  measure  instruments  cannot  have  an  common  causally

origin and the two particles of the disintegration can travel in contrary senses one regarding

the other one,  to  the  light  speed,  so  that  we  can  obtain  the  results  of  both  measures  and  to

compare  them,  both  measuring  instruments,  together  with  the  rest  of  all  the  process

subsystems will be connected causally in some moment.

In  summary,  two  isolated  systems  are  independent,  that  is  to  say,  they  have  not  a

common  causal  origin,  they  are  not  only  spatially  separate  but  SPACE-TIMELY  separate.

Under these conditions it is verified in the totally the principle of causality.

Summary

The experience and the principle of causality are two facts which go hand in hand in a

narrow form. The experience is which allows us to recognize more or less general principles,

but  without  the  principle  of  causality  we  could  not  accumulate  experience,  because  the

universe  would  be  we  irregular.  Two  observations:  1ª  the  existence  of  the  4  dimensions

space-time  and  2ª  the  principle  of  causality,  they  allow  us  to  conclude  the  light  speed

constancy in the inertial frames, as well as the particular characteristics of the light: particles

without mass, neither electrical charging, ... and in general without measurable magnitudes in

the homogeneous space-time.

The  exact  formulation  of  the  principle  of  causality  conduct  us  to  understand  the

meaning of the time coordinate, its identity with the space coordinates and lastly to solve the

paradox that raise the local action principle.

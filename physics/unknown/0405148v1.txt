Abstract

A "magnetic" photon hypothesis associated with magnetic monopoles is tested experimentally.
These photons are predicted to easily penetrate metal. Experimentally the optical transmittance T of
a metal foil was less than 2 x 10-17. The hypothesis is not supported since it predicts T = 2 x 10-12.

The intriguing possibility  of  a  second,  penetrating  form  of  light  is  allowed  within  several
variants of classical electromagnetism, in particular nonzero photon mass or  the  existence  of  a
second "magnetic" photon associated with the theory of monopoles.

Electromagnetism in the presence of nonzero photon mass is described by the Maxwell-Proca

length, the Compton wavelength of the photon, with mg  as the photon mass. A nonzero photon mass
would, among other effects,  give rise to a wavelength dependence of the speed of light in free space,
and the possibility of longitudinal electromagnetic waves. Such longitudinal waves are predicted to
be created when a transverse wave is obliquely incident on an interface between dissimilar materials
[3], and they are partially converted back into transverse waves by interaction with another interface.
The conversion efficiency is small for any nonzero photon mass consistent with experiment. Since
the characteristic length is so large, photon mass is difficult to measure; either one  conducts  a
laboratory  scale  experiment  with  extremely  high  precision,  or  one  draws  inference  from
astrophysical  observation  on  a  large  scale.  Since  the  wavelength  of  visible  light  is  so  short
compared with any reasonable Compton wavelength for the photon, attempts to generate and detect
longitudinal  light  must  be  far  less  sensitive  than  quasistatic  methods.  Recently  a  laboratory
experiment [4] was done to detect effects of cosmic magnetic vector potential on a toroid. That and
a more recent experiment [5] of similar design set limits on  photon  mass  but  did  not  detect  any
effects.

(1966) [7] considered two variants of monopole theory, one which involved large unphysical C-
violating effects in atomic physics, and the  other  involving  two  kinds  of  photons,  electric  and
magnetic. The electric photons interact with leptons and hadrons, and the magnetic photons would
interact with hadrons but not leptons. This magnetic photon concept was critiqued [8,9] in view of
the  fact  the  electric  and  magnetic  sources  become  independent,  so  one  loses  the  Dirac  [10]
quantization condition. Monopole theories without a second magnetic photon give a  static  pole
strength of zero [8] or are noncovariant [9]. Moreover, the Dirac monopole and finite photon mass
cannot coexist within the same theory [11]. More recently, a model of magnetic monopoles was
presented [12] in which the magnetic photon couples tensorially, interpreted as coupling with the
velocity,  of  electric  charges  with  respect  to  the  cosmic  background.  This  theory  predicts  that
creation, shielding, and absorption of magnetic photons is  suppressed  by  a  factor  of  7  x  105
compared with normal electric photons of the same energy. The magnetic photons are predicted to
penetrate  metal  since  the  penetration  depth  for  visible  light  is  a  few  nanometers,  so  the
corresponding depth for magnetic photons is expected to be a few millimeters. Since both creation
and detection of magnetic photons are suppressed by the same factor, the predicted intensity of light
detected after passage through a metal foil is a factor 2 x 10-12 weaker than the incident beam. The
present work is directed toward experimental evaluation of such effects.

A preliminary experiment was conducted using an amplified silicon detector (Newport, type 834
optical power meter). A 600 W halogen projector bulb was set up with a fan for cooling. A 125 mm
diameter lens system derived from a TV projection system was used  to  focus  the  light  to  a  spot
about 1 cm in size. The power inferred over the 1 cm2 detector area was about 13 W. This detector
is sensitive to both visible light and near infrared. The detector was prepared without the usual
attenuator filter; the face was  covered  with  a  single  layer  of  aluminum  foil  of  thickness  13  µm.
Additional layers were taped around the sides to exclude stray light. The display was observed as
the lamp was turned on and off. No effect was seen, within the instrument's resolution of 100 fW.
The foil's transmittance limit is therefore  T < 8 x 10-15, a value lower than predicted by a factor of
at least 250.

Experiments were conducted using  an  MH983  channel  type  photomultiplier  (Perkin-Elmer
Optoelectronics, Fremont, CA) to detect light. The claimed quantum efficiency is  about  15%  at  a
wavelength of 450 nm, 7.5% at 532 nm and 2% at 600 nm. The sensitive photocathode is about 5
mm in diameter. The photomultiplier face was covered with a single layer of aluminum foil  of
thickness 13 µm. The foil was secured with black tape and additional layers were added to the sides
of the device to exclude stray light. The photomultiplier was  then  clamped  to  a  support  upon  an
isolated optical table.  A beam from an 80 mW diode-pumped YAG laser at 532 nm was directed at
the center of the foil covered recessed photomultiplier face. The pulse output of the photomultiplier
was input into an oscilloscope and a digital counter (Fluke 1953A). Data were collected in groups
of six trials of ten seconds each, with the laser off and with the laser on. The average count rate with
the laser off was 3.2 ± 0.25 counts per second. With the laser on, two such runs yielded 4.4  ±  0.95
and 3.8 ± 0.45. A subsequent set  of  six  trials  with  the  laser  off  yielded  3.7  ±  0.27  counts  per
second.    Here  ±  refers  to  the  standard  deviation.  These  count  rates  are  comparable  to  the
manufacturer's claimed dark count rates of about 3 per second "typical" (at 20 °C)  and  5  for  the
present unit (at 22 °C). A transmittance of 2 x 10-12 based on [12] of 80 mW green light detected
with a 7.5% quantum efficiency would give 3.2 x 104 counts per second. The results are consistent
with between 0 and 0.3 counts per second over noise. The transmittance limit is therefore T < 2 x
10-17, a value lower than predicted by five orders of magnitude.

A further test was conducted using a 50 W halogen projector lamp (with reflector) as a source
and the photomultiplier as a detector. The rationale is to allow for the possibility that sources may
not be equivalent in the hypothetical emission of magnetic photons. The visible intensity (measured
with a filtered silicon sensor) was about 160 mW/cm2 at 70 mm from the lamp, corresponding to
about 30 mW over the 5 mm diameter sensitive cathode. This is a somewhat less stringent test than
the  one  with  the  laser  in  view  of  the  lower  power  and the  fact  the  photomultiplier  has  limited
sensitivity in the red region dominated by the halogen lamp. Six trials of ten seconds with the lamp

3

on yielded 2.7 ± 0.67 counts per second. This rate is comparable to the dark count rate measured
above, with no laser light. The lamp was turned off and six further measurements of  ten  seconds
each yielded 5.1 ± 0.63 counts  per  second.  The  slight  increase  in  count  rate  with  the  lamp  off,
though still within the range of accepted dark count rate for the device, was attributed to the known
tendency of photomultipliers to increase their dark count with temperature, since the optical and
infrared output of  the  lamp  was  sufficient  to  warm  the  front  of  the  sensor.  Indeed,  that  is  why
photomultipliers are cooled for high performance applications. A temperature effect on the dark
count is also the likely cause for the slight increase in dark count after the above laser experiments
in comparison with the dark count before.

In summary, the experimental results do not support the theory suggested in [12] that magnetic
photons which couple with charges via a velocity term give rise to a second form of light. That
theory has no adjustable parameters. The experiments are more sensitive by  a  factor  of  105  than
needed to detect such magnetic photons.

There are several monopole theories involving magnetic photons. In addition to  those  of  Ref.
[7],  [12],  supersymmetric  SU(N)  gauge  theories  can  predict  gluino  condensate  in  which  the
superpotential gives a mass to the dual (magnetic) photon [13]. A U(1) theory including magnetic
photons was developed to predict monopole pair production [14].  Chiral components of a rank-2
spinor field were taken as the dynamic variables of a monopole theory which accommodates the
magnetic photon [15] which interacts only with monopole charges and currents. Implications of
most such theories in the absence of monopoles were not explored in detail. Therefore we have not
excluded the possibility of the existence or detectability of magnetic photons within a theoretical
framework different from that in [12].

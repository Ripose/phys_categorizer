Abstract

We will derive both quaternion and octonion algebras as the Clebsch-Gordan algebras

based upon the su(2) Lie algebra by considering angular momentum spaces of spin one

and three. If we consider both spin 1 and 1

2 states, then the same method will lead to the
Lie-super algebra osp(1,2). Also, the quantum generalization of the method is discussed

on the basis of the quantum group suq(2).

the Proceedings of the Commemoration of Prof. Wu by World Scientiﬁc Publications.

1. Introduction

The Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of the angular momentum algebra in the quantum

mechanics have a rich structure. We have shown in ref. 1 (referred to as I hereafter) that

the Clebsch-Gordan recoupling of the spin 3 system will eﬀectively lead to the octonion

algebra. Let ψj(m)

the angular momentum j with j = 0, 1

≡ |

j, m > with m = j, j
2 , 1, 3

1, . . . ,

j be the standard eigenfunction for

−
2 , . . .. Let j be a integer and introduce now a

−

2j + 1 dimensional algebra with the product deﬁned by

ψj(m1)

ψj(m2) = bj

pling of two angular momentum states j1 and j2 into j3. Note that we are restricting here

we may rewrite Eq. (1.1) as

where we have set

for simplicity. Especially, Eq. (1.4) implies that the algebra is commutative for j = even

but anti-commutative for j = odd. We may also introduce a bilinear (not sesqui-linear)

form by

ψj(m2) > = (2j + 1)

now for both integer as well as half-integer values of j. Then, we will have

ψj(m1) > = (

(1.7)

which is symmetric for integer j but anti-symmetric for half integer j. It also satisﬁes the

associative trace condition for integer j, i.e.

ψj(m3) > = < ψj(m1)

ψj(m2)

ψj(m3) >

as we may easily verify from properties of the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient. We have shown

in I that the algebra deﬁned by Eq. (1.3) give the Lie algebra su(2) for j = 1 and the

7-dimensional exceptional Malcev algebra2) for the case of j = 3. They are intimately

connected with the quaternion and octonion algebras as follows. We will adjoin the spin 0
state e0 ≡ |

j = 0, m = 0 > and modify Eq. (1.3) as

ψj(m1)

ψj(m2) = aj < ψj(m1)

ψj(m2) > e0 + bjCj(m1, m2)ψj(m1 + m2)

(1.9a)

∗

|

where e0 acts as the unit element, i.e.

We also set

e0 ∗

ψj(m) = ψj(m)

e0 = ψj(m)

,

∗

e0 = e0

.

e0 ∗

ψj(m) > = < ψj(m)

e0 > = 0 ,

< e0|

(1.9b)

(1.9c)

(1.10a)

(1.10b)

If we choose the constant aj in Eq. (1.9a) suitably, then the modiﬁed algebra now lead

to the quaternion and octonion algebras, respectively for j = 1 and j = 3. The group-

theoretical reasons behind these statements will be found in I. In this note, we will ﬁrst

explicitly demonstrate these facts in terms of identities among Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients

in section 2. If we consider a system consisting of j = 1 and j = 1

2 , then the resulting
algebra turns out to be the Lie-super algebra3) osp(1,2). Similarly, we can generalize the

octonion algebra into a super algebra by now using spins 0, 3, and 3

2 . Finally, we will make

3

a comment on the possibility of constructing quantum quaternion and quantum octonion

algebras by use of the quantum Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients4) of the quantum group suq(2).

2. Quaternion and Octonion Algebras

Let us ﬁrst consider the simplest case of spin one. It is then easy to verify that the

Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients satisfy the special relation of form

C1(m1, m2)C1(m1 + m2, m3) =

1
2 {

(

1)m2δm2+m3,0 −
−

(

1)m1δm1+m3,0}
−

(2.1)

for any values 0, and

1 for m1, m2, and m3. As the consequence, the product deﬁned

by Eq. (1.3) satisﬁes

±

(ψ1(m1)

ψ1(m2))

ψ1(m3) =

element e0 leads to the quaternion algebra.

We will next consider the case of j = 3. Although we will no longer have such a simple

relation as Eq. (2.1), the following identity can be veriﬁed to be valid:

corresponds to the 7-dimensional simple Malcev algebra.2) Moreover, if we adjoin the unit

element e0 as in Eqs. (1.9) and (2.7), then it gives the octonion algebra, provided that we

assign a suitable value of a3. However, we will not go into detail here which can be found

in I.

It is sometimes more convenient to use quantities associated with the Cartesian, rather

than polar coordinates. For example, the spin one system may be labelled simply as a

vector φµ for µ = 1, 2, 3. Then, the product Eq. (1.1) will be simply written as

3. Lie-super Algebra OSP(1,2)

If we consider algebras containing both integer and half-integer spin states, it will

lead to super-algebras, where the integer spin states correspond to bosonic elements while

the half-integer ones give the fermionic components. As a example, consider the system

consisting of j = 1 and j = 1

is not determined since the constants a1 and a2 are arbitrary. However, the symmetry

strongly suggests the choice of a1 = a2 in Eqs. (3.1c) and (3.1d) so that we have

Further, the resulting Lie-super algebra corresponds to the ortho-symplectic one osp(1,2).

In order to prove these assertions made above, it is more convenient to use quantities in

the Cartesian coordinate, where φµ(µ = 1, 2, 3) refers to spin 1 and the spinor ξj(j = 1, 2)
represents spin 1

show next that the Lie-super algebra is osp(1,2), we ﬁrst rewrite Eq. (3.7a) by introducing

y = [x, y]. In this connection, we simply mention the fact that

Lie-super algebra osp(n,m) is intimately related to para-statistics6) where the boson and

fermion operators do no longer commute with each other.

We will next introduce a bilinear form by

We see then that the 4 bosonic elements e0, φ1, φ2, and φ3 deﬁne the usual quaternion

algebra. Therefore, Eqs. (3.21) may be regarded as a super generalization of the quaternion

algebra. However, it is no longer associative when the product involves fermionic element.

We can moreover prove that the algebra is super-quadratic, super-ﬂexible, and super-Lie-

admissible, although we will not go into detail.

We can repeat a similar analysis for octonion algebra. We now consider a system

consisting of j = 0, j = 3, and j = 3

2 . For products involving j = 3

Clebsch-Gordan algebra will be given by

the bosonic space, and the algebra may be considered also as a super generalization of the

octonion algebra. However, we will not go into its detail.

4. Quantum Clebsch-Gordan Algebra

Moreover, the anti-pode S : L

L operates as

Finally, the co-unit ǫ is given by

ǫ(J±) = 0 .

Actually, the new algebra is isomorphic to the quaternion algebra so that ththe quantum

quaternion algebra is nothing but the same as the usual quaternion algebra.

We can apply the same method for systems involving both j = 1 and 1

2 states to obtain
a quantum-deformed super algebra of osp(1,2). Analogously, if we consider j = 3, then

it will lead to a quantum generalization of the octonion algebra. However, by a reason

not given here, we have to actually use the quantum deformation of the 7-dimensional

representation of the exceptional Lie algebra G2 rather than the j = 3 states of su(2) in

order to properly describe the quantum octonion algebra. These, however, will be studied

in the future.

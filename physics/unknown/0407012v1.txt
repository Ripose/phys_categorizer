We  introduce  solitons  supported  by  Bessel  photonic  lattices  in  cubic  nonlinear  media. 

We  show  that  the  cylindrical  geometry  of  the  lattice,  with  several  concentric  rings, 

affords  unique  soliton  properties  and  dynamics.  In  particular,  besides  the  lowest-order 

solitons trapped in the center of the lattice, we find soliton families trapped at different 

lattice  rings.  Such  solitons  can  be  set  into  controlled  rotation  inside  each  ring,  thus 

featuring novel types of in-ring and inter-ring soliton interactions.

Propagation  of  optical  radiation  in  media  whose  guiding  properties  vary  in 

transverse  directions  exhibits  a  wealth  of  practically  interesting  phenomena  which  find 

applications  in  different  branches  of  physics,  including  waves  in  molecular  chains  [1], 

trapped Bose-Einstein condensates [2], or solids [3]. In particular, transverse modulation 

of refractive index can profoundly affect the properties of spatial optical solitons formed 

in  nonlinear  medium  through  the  competition  of  diffraction  and  nonlinear  self-action 

effects. In the case of periodic refractive index modulation discrete solitons are known to 

be  formed  in  the  evanescently  coupled  guiding  sites  of  the  array  [4].  The  interest  in 

propagation  of  such  solitons  is  dictated  mainly  by  their  rich  potential  for  all-optical 

switching, power and angle-controlled steering [5]. Recently it was predicted that lattices 

constituted  by  continuous  nonlinear  media  with  an  imprinted  harmonic  modulation  of 

the refractive index offer a number of opportunities for all-optical manipulation of light

signals  as  well  [6-8],  because  such  lattices  may  operate  in  both  weak-  and  strong-

coupling regimes [9] depending on the depth of refractive index modulation. In landmark 

recent  experiments  [10,11],  it  was  demonstrated  that  periodic  waveguide  lattices  with 

flexibly  controlled  refractive  index  modulation  depth  and  waveguide  separation  can  be 

formed  optically,  in  particular  in  photorefractive  media.  Besides  lowest-order  single 

solitons, harmonic lattices support optical vortices [12,13] and soliton trains [14]. 

To the date main efforts were devoted to analysis of spatial solitons supported by 

square, or honeycomb two-dimensional lattices that can be induced optically with several 

interfering  plane  waves.  The  properties  of  such  solitons  depend  crucially  on  the  lattice 

symmetry.  Thus,  the  periodicity  of  harmonic  lattices  dictates  the  structure  of  the 

existence domain of lowest-order solitons as well as the symmetry of field distribution for 

lattice vortices. Therefore, the fascinating question that arises is whether optical lattices 

with different types of symmetry offer new opportunities for soliton existence, managing 

and control. 

In  this  Letter  we  address  the  basic  properties  and  linear  stability  of  optical 

solitons  supported  by  radial-symmetric  Bessel  lattices  in  cubic  nonlinear  media.  Such 

lattices  are  especially  interesting  because  of  the  suppressed  diffraction  for  the  lattice-

inducing field, similarly to the case of harmonic lattices. Besides the expected guidance 

in the central core of the Bessel lattice, we found that localized bell-shaped solitons can 

be supported by different lattice rings. We also found that such solitons can rotate inside 

these rings without energy radiation. One of the central results we put forward here is 

the  possibility  of  controlling  the  interactions  of  solitons  located  within  the  same  or  in 

separated rings by inducing their rotary motions. 

We address the propagation of optical radiation along the  z  axis of a bulk cubic 

medium  with  a  transverse  modulation  of  linear  refractive  index,  described  by  the 

nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the dimensionless complex field amplitude q :

index. Here we address the case of the simplest zero-order Bessel lattice. Eq. (1) admits

 describing a nondiffracting laser beam [15]. 

Rigorously  such  beams  extent  to  the  transverse  infinite,  but  accurate  approximations 

can  be  generated  experimentally  in  a  number  of  ways.  Known  methods  include  simple 

techniques like annular slits in the focal plane of a lens and conical axicons, as well as 

more elaborated interferometric and holographic techniques (see Refs [16] and references 

quoted  therein).  It  is  worth  stressing  that  holographic  techniques  allow  producing  not 

only  single  Bessel  beams,  but  also  more  complicated  families  of  nondiffracting  beams. 

The  Bessel  photonic  lattices  addressed  in  this  paper  can  thus  be  imprinted,  e.g.,  in 

photorefractive  crystals,  using  the  techniques  recently  reported  for  the  generation  of 

harmonic  patterns  by  incoherent  vectorial  interactions  [10-13].  Because  of  the 

diffractionless nature of the Bessel beams, they are to be launched collinearly along the 

material with a polarization orthogonal to the soliton beams. 

First we address the properties of lowest-order solitons with the radial symmetry 

supported by a central guiding core of Bessel lattice. We search for solution of Eq. (1) in 

the  form  q

  to  obtain  various

. The properties of lowest order solitons whose intensity maximum coincides with 

the  axis  of  the  lattice  are  summarized  in  Fig. 1. At low energy flows solitons are wide

and  cover  several  lattice  rings,  while  at  high  energies  they  are  narrow  and  concentrate 

mostly within the core of the lattice (Fig. 1(b)). At small values of guiding parameter, 

the  energy  flow  is  a  non-monotonic  function  of  the  propagation  constant,  while  above 

the  critical  level 

p (cid:50)

3.91

,  the  energy  flow  increases  monotonically  with  growth  of 

propagation  constant  (Fig.  1(a)).  There  exists  a  lower  cut-off  b   on  propagation 

co

constant that increases with growth of refractive index modulation depth (Fig. 1(c)). At 

b

b→

co

 the soliton energy flow goes to zero. 

To  elucidate  the  linear  azimuthal  modulational  stability  of  the  above  soliton 

families  we 

searched 

for  perturbed

which  was  solved  numerically.  We  have  found  that  (in  agreement  with  the  Vakhitov-

Kolokolov stability criterion) lowest-order solitons supported by Bessel lattices are stable 

provided that the condition dU

/

db >

0

 is satisfied. Notice that at 

p (cid:49)

3.91

 there exists 

a  narrow  band  of  propagation  constants  near  cut-off  where  dU

/

db ≤

0

  and  thus  the 

corresponding  solitons  are  unstable  (see  inset  in  Fig.  1(c)  for  the  borders  of  instability 

band  and  Fig.  1(d)  for  dependence  of  the  growth  rate  with  the  propagation  constant). 

When the guiding parameter reaches a critical value, we found that the solitons become 

stable in the entire domain of their existence. 

 

A  fascinating  example  of  localized  self-sustained  light  structure  supported  by 

Bessel lattices is given by solitons trapped in different rings of the lattice. Solitons in the 

ring can be formed due to the local radial maximum of the refractive index. We searched 

for  profiles  of  such  solitons  in  the  form  q

supporting solitons are shown by circles). The energy flow is a non-monotonic function 

of  the  propagation  constant  (Fig.  2(b)).  At  low  energy  flows  soliton  becomes  spatially 

extended  and  covers  several  neighboring  lattice  rings.  The  cut-off  on  propagation 

constant b  increases monotonically with growth of the guiding parameter.

To elucidate the stability of solitons trapped in the rings, we performed extensive 

set of simulations of Eq. (1) with an input conditions  q

where

  describes  a  broadband  random  perturbation.  Simulations  revealed  that 

solitons  suffer  from  exponential  instabilities  close  to  cut-off  and  become  completely 

stable above a certain energy threshold. The corresponding solitons are relatively narrow 

and  their  overlap  with  neighboring  rings  diminishes.  The  threshold  energy  flow  that  is 

necessary for stabilization decreases with growth of refractive index modulation depth. 

 

One of central results of this Letter is the possibility to induce rotary motion of 

solitons  trapped  inside  the  ring  (Figs.  2(c)  and  2(d)).  This  can  be  done  either  by 

launching a laser beam tangentially to the lattice rings or by imposing the phase twist 

exp(

iνφ
)

  on  the  stationary  soliton  solutions  described  above.  The  important  effect  is 

that upon rotation inside the input ring soliton does not radiate, and thus survives for 

thousands  of  diffraction  lengths  even  in  the  presence  of  broadband  input  noise.  If  the 

imposed  phase  twist  ν   (or  launching  angle)  exceeds  a  critical  value,  the  soliton  leaves 

the  ring  where  it  was  initially  located  and  moves  across  the  lattice  until  it  complete 

decay under the influence of radiative losses. The larger the refractive index modulation 

depth the higher the accessible value of the phase twist, and hence the higher the soliton 

angular frequency. The possibility of excitation of rotary motion of solitons inside Bessel 

lattice  might  find  direct  applications  in  future  soliton  circuits.  Among  other  options  is 

the possibility of controlling the output soliton angle and soliton position. 

 

We  have  found  a  rich  variety  of  interaction  scenarios  for  collective  motion  of 

solitons inside the lattice rings. Some illustrative examples of such dynamical structures 

of  soliton  pairs  are  presented  in  Fig.  3.  Usually  we  set  one  of  identical  solitons  (upper 

one) into rotation by superimposing a phase twist, while the second soliton was initially 

at rest. For low 

ν

 values the interaction is highly sensitive to phase difference between 

solitons. Out-of-phase solitons tend to repel each other and as a result a steadily rotating 

soliton  pair  with  fixed  separation  between  components  is  formed  despite  the  fact  that 

one  of  the  solitons  was  not  set  initially  into  motion  (column  (a)).  This  indicates  the 

 

5

existence  of  rotating  stable  complexes  that  consist  of  solitons  with  alternating  phases 

located  within  one  ring.  In-phase  solitons  fuse  upon  collision  into  one  soliton  of  higher 

intensity rotating with lower angular frequency than the initial one (column (b)). When 

the  phase  twist  imposed  on  the  upper  soliton  is  high  enough  we  found  that  the  two 

interacting solitons always fuse upon collision. 

A  remarkable  scenario  was  encountered  upon  the  interaction  of  out-of-phase 

solitons trapped in different lattice rings (column (c)). One finds that the soliton in the 

internal  ring  is  able  to  reverse  the  rotation  direction  upon  the  first  interaction.  This 

results  in  rotation  of  solitons  located  in  different  rings  in  opposite  directions;  the 

consecutive  interactions  (or  collisions)  of  the solitons is then accompanied by reversing 

the rotation direction. Such lattice soliton interactions might be the basis of a new class 

of soliton-based blocking and routing schemes [5]. 

 

Finally  we  illustrate  an  example  of  a  complex  static  soliton  structure  supported 

by  the  Bessel  lattice  that  can  be  viewed  as  a  combination  of  out-of-phase  solitons 

supported  by  the  first  ring  and  the  core  (Fig.  4(a)).  Such  structures  are  somehow 

analogous  to  twisted  (dipole-mode)  soliton  in  harmonic  lattices.  Their  energy  flow 

becomes  a  monotonically  growing  function  of  propagation  constant  for  high  enough 

values of guiding parameter (Fig. 4(b)). Numerical simulations showed that such twisted 

solitons  (Fig.  4(a))  suffer  from  oscillatory  instabilities  near  their  cut-off  and  become 

stable  above  an  energy  threshold.  The  structure  of  such  twisted  solitons  suggests  the 

possibility to pack several solitons (Fig. 4(d)) with appropriately engineered phases into 

a  compact  composite  and  then  to  extract  solitons  from  it.  Notice  that  these  twisted 

solitons can rotate around the lattice rings upon propagation. 

 

To conclude, we revealed that the cylindrical geometry of Bessel photonic lattices, 

with  several  concentric  radial  rings,  affords  a  wealth  of  new  soliton  features,  both 

stationary  and  dynamical.  In  particular,  we  found  soliton  families  trapped  at  different 

lattice  rings,  which  can  be  set  into  controlled  rotation  inside  each  ring,  thus  featuring 

unique types of soliton interactions. Here we considered cubic nonlinear media, but the 

concept can be extended to all relevant physical settings, including other types of optical 

nonlinearities and Bose-Einstein condensates.

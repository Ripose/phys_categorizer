Abstract:  Internal  transport  barrier  (ITB)  has  been  obtained  in  full  lower  hybrid  current  driven  (LHCD) 
plasmas on a superconducting tokamak, TRIMA-1M (R=0.84m, a x b=0.12mx0.18m, BT<8T). The formation of 
ITB depends on the current density profile, j(r), varied by the power deposition of the lower hybrid (LH). The 
plasma with ITB can be maintained by the LH power deposited around the foot point of ITB up to 25 sec, which 
corresponds to more than 100 times of current diffusion time, τL/R. ITB is terminated by the reduction of current 
drive  efficiency  caused  by  metal  impurities  accumulation.  In  some  condition,  self-organized  slow  sawtooth 
oscillations (SSSO) of plasma current, density, temperature, and so on with the period comparable to the current diffusion 
time have been also observed during ITB discharge. The oscillation has the capability of particle exhaust, as the result, it 
may play an role in the avoidance of the impurity accumulation and the dilution in the future steady state fusion plasma with 
ITB, as the edge-localized mode in H-mode.   
 
1.  Introduction 
 

Steady  state  operation  of  high  performance  plasma  is  one  of  the  key  issues  to  realize 
cost-effective  fusion  power  plant.  High  performance  plasma  with  the  transport  barrier  is  a 
good candidate from the view of plasma confinement [1-7]. Especially it is important that the 
high  performance  plasma  was  maintained  by  fully  non-inductive  current  drive.  Some 
experimental observations have been shown to achieve the good performance plasma for the 
longer  duration  than  the  current  diffusion  time  [8,  9].  Many  studies  of  internal  transport 
barrier  (ITB)  were  carried  out  in  many  devices  and  it  was  found  that  ITB  is  common 
phenomena [10-13]. In tokamak plasmas, transport coefficients have strong relation to current 
density profile, that is magnetic shear [4, 5], and the current profile control is important tool 
for the control the performance of the plasma. Especially lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) 
is  powerful  tool  for  the  control  of  current  profile  and  in  fact  some  experiments  show  the 
promising possibility [14, 15]. The avoidance of impurities accumulation is one of key issue 
to execute steady state operation of ITB [16, 17] 

Recently,  self-organized  sinusoidal  oscillation  could  be  observed  in  long  duration  plasma 
maintained  by  fully  non-inductive  LHCD  on  Tore  Supra  [18].  This  oscillation  could  be 
understood  as  a  predator-pray  instabilities  derived  from  the  variation  of  the  transport 
coefficient related to current density profile as the following. The power deposition of LHCD 
depends  on  the  electron  temperature  and  the  electron  temperature  is  also  controlled  by  the 
transport  coefficient  related  to  current  density  profile.  The  relation  was  formed  a 
predator-prey relation and as the result the oscillation in the electron temperature and current 
density  profile  appears  in  core  region  of  the  non-inductive  long  duration  discharge.  The 
growth rate of the oscillation is zero and there are no effects in the exhaust of the accumulated 
impurities and it may not play an essential role in the particle exhaust of the plasma with ITB 
[18].   

On TRIAM-1M [19], the formation of ITB and the oscillation related with ITB formation 
has been obtained in ECD plasmas [20-22]. The plasma with ITB can be maintained by the 
LH power deposited around the foot  point  of  ITB up to 25 sec, which corresponds to more 
than  100  times  of  current  diffusion  time,  τL/R.  The  oscillation  has  the  capability  for  the 
exhaust  of  the  particles  including  the  impurities.  In  fact,  a  transition  to  high  performance 

2                                                                                                                                   

plasma with ITB could be achieved under the high influx of impurities.   

In  section  2,  the  brief  introduction  of  the  experimental  apparatus  is  shown  and  the 
experimental  results  concerning  the  formation  of  ITB  is  described  in  section  3  and 
consequently the results of the oscillation related ITB formation is shown in the section 4. The 
summary is described in the section 5. 

 

 

 
2.  Experimental Apparatus 
 

  TRIAM-1M (R=0.84m, a x b=0.12m x 0.18m) is a small size high magnetic field tokamak 
with  16  superconducting  toroidal  magnetic  field  coils  made  of  Nb3Sn,  which  produces  the 
toroidal magnetic field, BT, up to 8T in steady state. Experiments described in this paper are 
carried  out  by  two  8.2  GHz  LHCD  systems.  One  system  (System_1)  has  the  capability  to 
change  the  power  during  the  discharge  and  change  the  refractive  index  along  the  magnetic 
field, N//, of LHW shot by shot. Another system (System_2) has the capability to control the 
value of N// of LHW during a discharge with 10 degree per a second as well as the power.   

Main  diagnostics  in  this  paper  are  a  soft  X-ray  (SXR)  detector  array  composed  of  19ch 
silicon surface barrier (SSB) diodes sensitive to photon in the range of 0.07keV-30keV and a 
hard X-ray (HXR) detector array composed of 7ch NaI scintillators sensitive to photon with 
40-500keV. Low energy part of HXR is absorbed by the vacuum window made of Aluminum. 
The NaI scintillators have been arranged along the major radius. The viewing chord sets to the 
perpendicular direction to the toroidal magnetic field

Typical  waveforms  of  the  discharge 
with  ITB  are  shown  in  Fig.1(a).  The 
time slices of the profile of soft X-Ray 
and ion temperature, Ti, are also shown 
in  Figs.1(b)  and  (c).  The  plasma  was 
maintained  by  the  combination  of  two 
the  different  N// 
LH  waves  with 
controlled  by  the  phase  difference  of 
the adjacent waveguide at the launcher. 
All of the plasma current was driven by 
these LH power non-inductively at any 
time  except  the  start-up  phase  of  the 
discharge. The LH power of System_1 
was  gradually  raised  from  3  s  to  3.5s 
by  50kW.  As  the  result,  both  plasma 
current and electron density follow the 
increase  of  injected  LH  power.  In  this 
duration,  the  current  drive  efficiency 
did  not  change  with  that  before  the 
increment  of 
the  LH  power  of 
System_1. From 3.5s, the LH power of 
the System_2 is gradually reduced and 
the  abrupt  increase  of  the  electron 
density  can  be  observed  around  4.2s. 
At  that  time,  the  profile  of  SXR 
Intensity,  ISX,  is  also  peaked  as  shown 
in  Fig.  1(b)  and  the  current  drive

efficiency is also improved. When the LH power of System_2 is not reduced, the peaked ISX 
profile is not obtained. While the LH power of System_1 is not raised, the peaked ISX profile 
is not also obtained. These results show that the LH power of System_1 assists the formation 
of the peaked ISX profile and that of System_2 obstructs it. The peaked ISX profile shows that 
the electron pressure is peaked as shown in the rapid increase of electron density. When the 
peaked ISX profile is formed, the total of the injected LH power to the plasma is reduced. This 
shows that the peaked electron pressure is not made by the increment of the deposited power 
to the center of the plasma, but by the reduction of transport coefficient around r=5 cm, where 
is around the foot of ITB in the plasma. The ion temperature, Ti, at the center of the plasma 
also  increases  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(c)  at  the  time  of  C  in  Fig.  1(a).  The  ion  transport  is 
tentatively  improved  during  more  during  the  reduction  of  the  power  of  LH  as  shown  by 
closed circles in Fig. 1(c). The high Ti state is called as “Meta stable” and it can be maintained 
by the control of the power level and N// of the injected LH wave. After the transition, the LH 
power of System_1 is gradually reduced and the back-transition takes place around 7 s. After 
the back-transition, ne, IP and Ti return to the previous levels and finally the further reduction 
of the LH power makes the termination of the plasma. The LH power required to maintain the 
plasma current is about 30kW.

To  investigate  the  difference  of  the 
effect of each LH power to the plasma, 
the modulation of the LH power during 
the discharge was carried out. The LH 
power  modulation  was  executed  from 
5s  to  6s  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  LH 
power was modulated every 100ms by 
15% of the power. The plasma current 
and 
also 
electron  density  were 
modulated  as  shown  in  Fig.1.  The 
intensities  of  HXR,  IHX,  correspond  to 
the  signal  of  the  pressure  of  tail 
electrons around 40keV. It is noted that 
IHX  is  also  proportional  to  the  bulk 
electron  density  and  Zeff.  To  remove 
the  effect  of  electron  density  and  Zeff 
profile to IHX signal, the inversed decay 
time,  1/IHXdIHX/dt  is  calculated  and 
they  are  plotted  as  the  function  of 
minor  radius  as  shown  in  Fig.2.  When 
the  inversed  decay  time  is  multiplied 
by  energy  stored  of  tail  electrons,  the 
power  deposition  of  LHW  will  be 
calculated.  The  power  deposition  of 
System_1 is mainly deposited at the position of r=5cm in any cases, it suggests that the LH 
power of System_1 is mainly deposited at the position of r=5cm and it plays a role in making 
broad current profile. While the LH power of System_2 is deposited at the center of plasma 
and it makes peaked current profile. This suggests that the formation of ITB is assisted by the 
LH current drive at the foot point of ITB.

4.  Maintenance of ITB   

 
The long duration discharge with ITB by use of only System_1 can be achieved up to 25 s, 
which  corresponds  to  100  times  of  current  diffusion  time,  τL/R  is  shown  in  Fig.  3.  A 
back-transition  takes  place  during  the  discharge,  and  the  discharge  can  be  maintained  by 
LHCD for 36 sec. The influx of ferrite estimated by the line intensity of FeI increases during 

4                                                                                                                                   

the discharge gradually. In the other discharge, just before the termination of ITB, a number of 
grains of Molybdenum put into the plasma and plasma performance become to be worse. The 
grains come from the poloidal limiter made of Molybdenum. The time evolution of the line 
intensity  of  Mo  XIII  inversely  synchronizes  with  that  of  the  plasma  current.  These  indicate 
that the metal impurity accumulation plays an essential role in the back-transition from high 
performance plasma with ITB.

Fig. 3 Time evolutions of Ip, Fe I, and Mo I of the long duration ITB discharge are shown. On the 
middle of the discharge, ITB was terminated at 27 sec and then the plasma was terminated at 36 
sec from the start of discharge.   
 

5.  Self-organized Oscillation related with ITB   
 

The new kind  of  self-organized  slow  sawtooth  oscillation  (SSSO)  has  been  observed  in 
long-duration  fully  non-inductive  LHCD  plasmas.  SSSO  has  been  obtained  only  in  high 
performance  plasma  with  ITB.  The  period  of  the  oscillation  is  comparable  to  the  current 
diffusion  time, τL/R,  of  the  plasma  (a  few  handreds  ms).  The  crashes  of  SSSO  is  sometimes 
accompanied by precursor, which is similar to the predator-pray instability observed in Tore 
Supra. This precursor has no helical structure and the period is similar to  the change of the 
current profile (a few tens ms).   

The typical waveforms of the plasma parameters are shown in Fig. 4. The plasma current 
is maintained by lower hybrid wave (LHW) of the peak N//=1.8 excited by System_1, where 
N//  is  the  refractive  index  along  the  magnetic  field  line.  From  the  beginning  of  plasma,  the 
additional LHW excited by another LHCD device of the frequency in 8.2GHz is injected into 
the plasma. The value of N// of System_2 is shifted from 1.8 (0-2sec) to 2.0 (4sec-the end of 
the  discharge)  during  the  discharge.  The  net  injection  power  of  RF  increases  at  1.2  sec 
because of the improvement of the coupling between microwave and the plasma, and as the 
result the first jump of IP and ne occurs around 1.2 sec as shown in Figs. 4(a) and (b), where 
the  relative  intensity  between  SXR  emitted  at  the  center  chord  and  at  the  peripheral  chord 
does  not  change  so  much  as  shown  in  Fig.  4(d).  The  second  jump  of  IP  and  ne  is  observed 
around 1.5sec, although the net LH power does not change [20-22]. At the second jump, the 
intensity (ISX) of SXR at the center chord burgeons and that at the peripheral chord decreases 
slightly.  This  shows  that  the  formation  of  steep  gradient  of  ne  and  electron  temperature,  Te, 
occurs at the time of the second jump, which shows the formation of ITB in the plasma. The 
position of ITB foot is estimated by the profile of SXR and it locates around r=6 cm (r/a=0.5), 
where r and a are the distance between line of sight and the plasma center and minor radius of 
the plasma, respectively. The intensity (IHX) of hard X-ray (HXR) at the center of the plasma 
also burgeons as shown in Fig. 3(d). This suggests that ITB of ne is formed, rather than Te. 
The  formation  of  ITB  has  the  strong  relation  to  the  LH  power  [20]  and  Ν// [21].  
With  the 
reduction of N//, the deposition of LHW is far from the center of plasma and the current drive 
efficiency, ηCD, degrades. When the value of Ν// of the additional LHW sets to more than 2.4, 
ITB is not able to be achieved. It is found that the power deposited at the center of the plasma 
prevents from forming ITB, where the power deposition can be measured with the variation

occurs due to the shift of the N// from 2 to

Zeff.  The  intensity  of  FeI  (IFeI),  which  is

and  IMoI  is  measured  with  a  spectroscopy 
viewing  the  movable  limiter  from  the 
bottom  port  of  #1.  Ferrite  come  form  the 
movable limiter installed on the upper part 
of  #1  port.  Energetic  electrons  produced 
by  LHW  are  directly  attacked  to  the 
movable  limiter.  The  movable  limiter  is 
made of SS covered by Molybdenum. The

Around 11 sec, an oscillation appears in plasma current, density and so on as sown in Fig. 
4. The periods of the oscillation is in the range of a few hundreds ms and it corresponds to the 
current  diffusion  time  (~200ms)  of  the  plasma.  This  oscillation  occurs  in  the  self-organized 
manner  and  the  oscillation  is  sometimes  accompanied  by  the  periodic  predator-pray  type 
instabilities  observed  in  Tore  Supra  [18]  just  before  the  crash.  The  termination  of  the 
discharge is not due to the long-duration oscillation, but to the shut-down of the LH power.   

The region of the appearance of the self-organized oscillation can be shown on the map of 
IFeI  and  the  value  of  N//  of  the  additional  LHW.  The  LHW  with  low  N//  has  the  preferable 
capability to the current drive and its current drive efficiency is better than that of the LHW 
with high N//. The plasma with ITB can be achieved in the plasma with the additional LHW 
with N//<2.4. When the value of N// of the additional LHW is less than 2.4, it is difficult to 
make the plasma with ITB. When the value of influx of ferrite is larger than a certain value, it 
is difficult to maintain the plasma with ITB. However, SSSO can work on the assistance with 
the formation of ITB even in the high influx of ferrite as shown in Fig. 6. This indicates that 

6                                                                                                                                   

SSSO  plays  an  essential  role  in  the  exhaust  of  the  metal  impurities  from  the  inside  of  ITB. 
This  action  of  SSSO  may  work  on  the  avoidance  of  the  impurity  accumulation  and  the 
dilution in steady state operation of fusion plasma with ITB.   

 

6.  Summary 
 

ITB has been obtained in full LHCD plasmas on a superconducting tokamak, TRIMA-1M 
(R=0.84m, a x b=0.12m x 0.18m, BT<8T). The plasma with ITB can be maintained by the LH 
power deposited around the foot point of ITB up to 25 sec, which corresponds to more than 
100 times of current diffusion time, τL/R. The metal impurity accumulation prevents us from 
maintaining the discharge with ITB for long time. The LH power deposited around ITB foot 
assists the formation of ITB and the LH power deposited at the center of the plasma obstacles 
it. This suggests that the hollow current profile is suitable to form ITB. Self-organized slow 
sawtooth  oscillations  (SSSO)  of  plasma  current,  density,  temperature,  and  so  on  with  the 
period comparable to the current diffusion time have been also observed in long duration full 
LHCD  discharges.  The  oscillation  appears  only  in  the  high  performance  plasma  with  ITB. 
The  action  of  particle  exhaust  caused  by  SSSO  is  preferable  to  avoid  the  impurity 
accumulation.

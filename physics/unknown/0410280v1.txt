Abstract--We   have   demonstrated   that   hole-type   gaseous
detectors, GEMs and capillary plates, can operate up to 77 K.
For   example,   a   single   capillary   plate   can   operate   at   gains   of
above 103 in the entire temperature interval between 300 until 77
K.  The same  capillary  plate  combined  with CsI  photocathodes
could   operate   perfectly   well   at   gains   (depending   on   gas
mixtures) of 100-1000. Obtained results may open new fields of
applications   for   capillary   plates   as   detectors   of  UV   light   and
charge particles at cryogenic temperatures: noble liquid TPCs,
WIMP detectors or LXe scintillating calorimeters and cryogenic
PETs.

I. Introduction

In   several   studies  and   applications   there   are   needs  for  the

detection of VUV light at cryogenic temperatures. Examples
could   be   some   high   energy   physics   and   astrophysics
experiments, noble liquid PETs, studies of cryogenic plasmas
and studies of quantum phenomenas in liquid and solid He. If
we focus only on high  energy physics then one of the main
applications   could   be   noble   liquid   TPCs   and   noble   liquid
scintillation calorimeters.

TPCs   are   rather   widely   used   detectors:   the   ICARUS
experiment, the nTOF experiment and WIMP search LXe/Ar
detectors are all examples. A cryogenic TPC is usually a large
volume filled with noble liquids (see Fig.1). If an interaction
occurs inside the liquid scintillation light and a charge track
are   produced   simultaneously.   The   scintillation   light   is
detected by photodetectors. By influence of the electric field,
parts of the primary electrons from the track are collected on
the position sensitive readout plate. This allows one to obtain
a 2D projection of the track. The time difference between the
scintillation   light   and   charge   collection   on   the   position
sensitive elements is used for the 3D track reconstruction. A
noble liquid TPC is a very powerful detector allowing one not
only to visualize the tracks, but also to measure the deposited
energy and perform event rejection from the measured light to

the charge ratio. As one can see photodetectors are important
components   of   the   TPCs.   Usually   PMs   are   used   as
photodetectors.

In a recent publication [1] we presented some preliminary
results   demonstrating   that   gaseous   detectors   with   solid
photocathodes   can   operate   at   low   temperatures.   This   may
open   possibilities   of   replacing   costly   and   bulky   PMs   with
cheap and simple photosensitive gaseous detectors. Note also
that   gaseous   detectors   are   not   sensitive   to   magnetic   fields
desirable for some experiments.

In this paper we will present our new results of systematic
studies   of   the   operation   of   gaseous   detectors   at   cryogenic
temperatures obtained with the latest equipments.

thickness was 400 nm). 

For  feedback  measurements   a   pulsed  H2  lamp   (a   few  ns)
was placed outside the cryostat (see Fig. 4). The same lamp in
combination with a Hg lamp was also used for the quantum
efficiency measurements.

The signals from the capillaries were read out by a charge
sensitive amplifier Ortec, 142 PC. In some measurements we
also   recorded   pulse-height   spectra   produce   by   radioactive
source or by H2 lamp (see [2] for more details).

II. Experimental Set Up

Our experimental chamber is shown schematically in Fig.
2. It consists of a cryostat with a test chamber located inside
(see also Fig.3). The cryostat we used was originally designed
for tests of ATLAS calorimeter modules. It was a very helpful
device in these studies since it was computer controlled and
allowed   the   cooling   to   take   place   to   LN2  or   any   other
temperature above it with a selected speed profile.   The test
chamber   was   filled   with   Ar+10%CH4  or   He+10%H2  gas
mixture at a pressure of 1 atm. If necessary a gas scintillation
chamber   could  be  attached   to  the   test  chamber   via  a   MgF2
window (see Fig.2). It was filled with Ar or Kr at P=1 atm.
The scintillation light was produced by an alpha source placed
inside. Inside the test chamber various gaseous detectors could
be installed. The main focus in these studies was on the hole-
type detectors because they have unique properties which are:
the ability to operate in poorly quenched gas mixtures and the
possibility to work in cascade mode. The hole-type detectors
used   in   these   studies  were   GEMs   or   capillary   plate   (CPs).
GEMs   had   sizes   of   5x5   cm2  and   hole   pitches   (50   µm   in
diameter) of 140 μm.   GEMs were used either in CAT (the
cathode was electrically connected to the readout plate placed
in contact) or cascade (two GEMs) mode. All capillaries used
had diameters of 20 mm, thicknesses of 0.4 or 0.8 mm, and
diameters of capillary holes of 40 or 100 µm.  

We   also   studied   the   operation   of   these   detectors   in
combination with CsI and others solid photocathodes (see [2]
for more  details).   For  these measurements  the  test  chamber
was slightly modified as shown in Fig.4. In this paper we will
present only some selected results obtained with reflective and
semitransparent  CsI photocathodes. Semitransparent  CsI (20
nm   thick)   was   deposit   on   the   inner   surface   of   the   MgF2
window. In the case of the reflective CsI photocathode, it was

can see that the maximum achievable gain of the GEM drops
sharply with the temperature, however, it could still operate
even at an LN2 temperature.

The figures 7 and 8 show the gain of the CPs in He+H2 and

can see that the maximum achievable gain of the CPs is much
higher   than   for   the   GEMs,   although   it   drops   with   the
temperature as well. Note that CPs could operat at gains of 103
even in pure Ar (see [2] for more details).

We also tested the operation of H2  treated CPs. Advantage
of this type CP is ability to operate at high counting rate [3].
Figure   9.   shows   how   the   resistivity   changes   with   the
temperature. The resistivity measured between the electrodes
of   the   H2  treated   CP   was   ~1GΩ.   At   this   temperature   the
resitivity   obeyed  the   Ohm’s   law.   At   LN2  temperature,   the
resistivity reaches the value of ~100 GΩ and begins to deviate
from   Ohm’s   law.   Gain   curves   for   the   H2-treated   CPs   are
presented in Fig. 10.

III. 2. The quantum efficiency and Gain Measurements with
Hole-type Gaseous Detectors Combined with Reflective and
Semitransparent Photocathodes.

The   procedure   of   the   CsI   quantum   efficiency   (QE)

calibration is described in [1].

The QE of hole-type detectors in Ar+10%CH4 and He+10%
H2  gas mixtures and at various temperatures are presented in
Fig. 11. One can see that the value of the QE was, depending
on the detector, between 14 and 5 %. Note that: the loss of the
measured   efficiency  at   T~80   K   is   due   to   the   strong   back
diffusion   of  photo  electrons   in   the   He+H2  gas   mixture   [1].
The absolute QE of the CsI itself remains almost unchanged
with temperature [1].

Figs.   12   and   13   summarizes   our   results   obtained   with
GEMs and CPs. One can see that in both cases the maximum
achievable gain  of detectors drops with the temperature, but
the   maximum   achievable   gain   with   the   CsI   photocathode
remains   almost   unchanged.   Thus   photosensitive   gaseous
detectors are able to operate at high gains even at cryogenic
temperatures.

IV. Conclusions.

It   was  demonstrated   experimentally  that   both   GEMs  and
CPs could operate at cryogenic temperatures-until 78K. CPs
offer the highest gain possible in a single step operating mode,
thus   they   could   be   used   to   detect   charges   at   cryogenic
temperatures, for example in WIMP detectors operating in a
charge extraction mode (see also [4]).

The   other   important   discovery  was  that   GEMs   and   CPs
combined   with   the   CsI   photocathodes   operate   at   cryogenic
temperatures as well, however the maximum achievable gain
is lower.

The   value   of   the   QE   at   cryogenic   temperatures   was
reasonably high in order to use these detectors as alternative
to PMs. This may open new avenues in applications: such as
the readout of noble liquid TPCs.

Note   that   photosensitive   gaseous   detectors   were   already
successfully  used   in   the   detection   of  the   scintillation   lights
from noble liquids and gases (see [1] ).

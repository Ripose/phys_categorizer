The lattice of laser-electron storage ring with controlled momentum compaction factor dedicated 
to generation of intense X-rays under Compton scattering is described. In such storage ring one 
can achieve the large energy acceptance and keep the long-term stable motion of electron beam 
with  large  energy  spread.  The  intensity  of  X-rays  may  be  very  stable  due  to  using  of  electron 
beam  with  steady-state  parameters  for  Compton  scattering.  Parameters  of  the  storage  ring, 
electron  beam  and  X-rays  obtained  by  electron  beam  dynamics  simulation  involving  Compton 
scattering are presented.

1. Introduction 
The proposal of the laser-electron storage rings (LESR) dedicated to hard X-rays generation by 
means of the Compton scattering of the laser light on low-energy electron beam of the storage 
ring  was  stated  in  1997  [1].  For  example,  in  order  to  obtain  X-rays  energy  εγ ≈ 33 keV  for 
angiographic  studies  under  Compton  scattering  of  laser  photons  with  energy  εlas = 1.164 eV 
(neodymium  laser)  one  needs  electron  beam  energy  E0 ≈ 43 MeV.  To  generate  such  X-rays  in 
synchrotron radiation source one needs electron beam energy E0 ≈ 2.5 GeV and superconducting 
wiggler with field B ≈ 7.5 T. It is clear that X-rays generators based on Compton scattering may 
become inexpensive, compact sources of the intensive X-rays. 
 
There are two basic problems in LESR design. The first one is associated with strong effect of 
the intrabeam scattering at low electron beam energy. Because of this effect the beam size grows 
quickly and Compton scattering intensity decreases. The second problem is associated with large 
electron  beam  energy  spread  because  of  fluctuation  of  Compton  generation.  The  value  of  the 
energy spread may run up to few percents and one needs to keep electron beam during long term 
in order to achieve the high Compton beam intensity. 
 
Two basic schemes of LESR were proposed for intensive Compton scattering. In the first scheme 
electron beam with non-steady-state parameters is supposed to be used. Intensive electron beam 
is  injected  from  linac  into  storage  ring  and  this  beam  is  being  used  during  short  term  within 
which  beam  size  does  not  significantly  increase  and  after  that  injection  is  repeated.  For  such 
experiments one needs linac with bunch charge qb ≈ 1-2 nC, beam emittance ε ≈ 30-50 nm and 
repetition frequency finj ≈ 10-100 Hz. In these conditions and under developing parameters of the 
laser  systems  designers  expect  average  scattered  beam  intensity  nγ ≈ 1013-1014 phot /s  and 
spectral brightness B ≈ 1013-1014 phot /(s*mm2*mrad*0.1%BW). The main imperfection of such 
LESR  scheme  is  the  pulse  nature  of  radiation  whereas  some  experiments  require  long-term 
stability of X-rays intensity (for example, biological studies, laser cooling of electron beam). 
 
In this paper the second scheme of LESR with controlled momentum compaction factor designed 
at NSC KIPT is described [2]. In such storage ring one can achieve the large energy acceptance 
and keep the long-term stable motion of electron beam with large energy spread. The intensity of 
X-rays may be very stable due to using of electron beam with steady-state parameters.

2. Main requirements for ring lattice 
Under  Compton  scattering  (CS)  of  laser  photon  on  relativistic  electron  the  energy  of  the 
scattered X-ray is determined by the following expression [3]

(3) 

where εγ is the scattered quanta energy, 
εlas is the laser photon energy, 
ϕ is the collision angle (ϕ = 0 corresponds to head-on collision), 
φ is the angle between vectors of electron and X-ray velocities, 
β = v / c is the ratio of electron and light velocities. 
 
Thus under head-on collision the quanta with maximal energy scatters towards the direction of 
electron velocity 

where γ is the Lorentz factor. 
 
In  single  collision  the  number  of  scattered  photons  is  determined  by  the  luminosity  L  and  the 
total cross-section of Thomson scattering σ 

εmax = 4 γ2 εlas , 

nγ = Lσ 

In laboratory frame under assumption of Gaussian distribution of densities of electron and laser 
beams the luminosity is described by the expression [4]

where σxe, σxl are the transversal sizes of the electron and laser beams at interaction point (IP) in 
collision plane (in plane where the vectors of the electron and laser photon velocities are located; 
below we assume laser beam propagates in reference orbit plane), 
σze, σzl and σse, σsl are the vertical and longitudinal sizes of the electron and laser beams, 
ne, nl are the numbers of electrons and photons in colliding beams. 
 
The  expressions  (1)-(3)  define  completely  the  requirements  for  electron  and  laser  beam 
parameters which determine the energy range and intensity of the scattered X-rays. 
 
Let us carry out the estimations of the Compton beam intensity from compact storage ring with 
circumference  C = 15 m  (revolution  frequency  is  equal  to  20 MHz)  for  collision  angle  ϕ = 10° 
and  for  modern  electron  and  laser  beam  parameters.  The  most  perspective  laser  for  using  in 
LESR is the neodymium laser which generates photons with energy εlas = 1.164 (2.328) eV. The 
modern  lasers  operate  at  repetition  frequency  frep ≈ 350 MHz,  pulse  duration  τp ≈ 10 ps  and 
average power P ≈ 10 W (≈ 30 nJ or 1.8*1012 photons are generated during single laser pulse). 
We assume the transversal laser beam size at IP σxl = σzl = 50 µ, longitudinal one σsl = 1.5 mm 
and  we  also  assume  electron  and  laser  beam  sizes  are  coinciding.  Under  these  parameters  in 
single  collision  we  obtain  the  probability  of  the  Compton  scattering  equal  approximately  to  
8*10-11  per  electron.  The  electron  bunch  containing  2 nC  (≈ 40 mA  per  bunch  of  the  stored 
current)  generates  nγ ≈ 2*107 phot /s.  It  is  not  enough  for  most  of  researches.  To  increase  the 
scattered  beam  intensity  we  need  to  increase  the  number  of  the  electron  bunches  and  laser 
photons number. We can essentially increase the laser flash energy by use of the optical cavity 
for  laser  pulses  stacking.  The  obtaining  of  the  colliding  beams  with  sizes  less  than  the  ones 

 

2

above mentioned is a very complicated task. Note, that longitudinal size essentially decreases the 
Compton beam intensity in a case of non-head-on collision, because the transversal size is as a 
rule much less than the longitudinal one. As is obvious from expression (3) the criterion of the 
collision angle smallness is determined by the expression 

tan2(ϕ / 2) < σx / σs 

(4) 

The less is the longitudinal size the higher is the permissible value of the collision angle without 
essential decreasing of the scattering intensity. 
 
As appears from above presented estimation the requirements for storage ring lattice suitable for 
obtaining of the intensive scattered beam are following: 

• 
• 
• 
• 

the transversal size of the electron beam at IP should be less than several tens of microns; 
the longitudinal one should be less than several millimeters; 
the bunch charge should be greater than 1 nC; 
the structure of the interaction region should allow the collision angle ϕ → 0. 

In practice it is very difficult to fulfil those requirements because of the details of the electron 
beam dynamics. 

3. Beam dynamics in LESR 

3.1. Details of beam dynamics in LESR. 
The  main  designing  problems  of  the  LESR  dedicated  for  generation  of  intensive  X-rays  in 
steady-state operation mode are associated with large steady-state energy spread of the electron 
beam.  As  a  result  of  the  CS  an  electron  loses  significant  part  of  energy  what  causes  strong 
excitation  of  the  synchrotron  oscillations  because  of  stochasticity  of  the  scattering.  The  partial 
energy spread due to CS is described by expression [4] 

where ε0 is the rest electron energy. For example, at γ = 100 (E0 ≈ 50 MeV) δCS ≈ 1.23 %. Due to 
combined effect of the synchrotron radiation (SR) and CS the total steady-state energy spread is

-1) is the total damping time of the synchrotron oscillations, 

where τtot = 1/(τCS
τCS ≈ E0Trev /∆ECS, τSR ≈ E0Trev /∆ESR are the partial damping times because of energy losses due 
to CS and SR, correspondingly, 
∆ECS, ∆ESR are the average energy losses per turn because of CS and SR, correspondingly, 
δSR is the partial energy spread caused by SR, 
Trev is the revolution time. 
 
Under intensive CS when energy losses caused by CS are comparable to those ones because of 
SR  the  steady-state  energy  spread  value  reaches  a  few  percents.  To  obtain  the  stable  electron 
beam motion we need to solve several serious problems. 
 
In first, to obtain the acceptable quantum life time we need the large energy acceptance of the 
storage ring and unreasonable RF-voltage may be required. There is no place in compact storage 
ring for the placement of the great number of the RF-cavities. 
 
In second, the transversal and longitudinal beam dynamics are determined in this case not only 
by  linear  on  momentum  deviation  effects  but  also  by  quadratic  and  higher  order  ones.  The 

 

3

aberrations do not allow to focus the electron beam at IP what causes the decreasing of the CS 
intensity.  Besides,  the  strong  chromatic  effects  cause  the  beam  diffusion  because  of 
synchrobetatron  resonance  at  high  RF-voltage.  The  quadratic  on  momentum  deviation  terms 
become apparent in longitudinal dynamics as the distortion of the separatrix shape and reducing 
of  the  RF-acceptance.  Thus,  we  need  the  possibilities of the suppression of aberrations in ring 
lattice. 
 
In third, the effects of the intrabeam scattering (IBS) become very strong at low electron beam 
energies.  The  emittances  growth  comparably  to  natural  emittances  may  reach  2-3  orders  what 
causes the essential increasing of the beam size and significant decreasing of the CS intensity. 
 
And  finally,  in  fourth.  The  sextupole  lenses  are  used  in  storage  rings  to  correct  the  chromatic 
effects. The natural chromaticity of the storage ring is very large under condition of the strong 
focusing of the electron beam at IP (compact storage ring with low-β insertion) and the required 
sextupole  strengths  also  become  large.  Dynamics aperture of the ring (DA) is reduced and the 
problem of the obtaining of the acceptable DA should also be solved at lattice design. 

3.2. The transversal beam dynamics 
The displacement of the electron orbit from reference one is determined by dispersion functions 
of the storage ring 

∆x = η1δ + η2δ2 + … 

where η1 and η2 are the linear and second order dispersion functions, correspondingly [5]

In  those  expressions  K1  and  K2  are  the  quadrupole  and  sextupole  strengths,  Qx  and  µx  are  the 
horizontal  betatron  frequency  and  phase  advance.  The  dispersion  causes  the  growth  of  the 
effective beam size so both dispersions must be suppressed at interaction point η1 = η2 = 0. As 
we  have  mentioned  above  both  quadrupole  and  sextupole  strengths  in  LESR  are  large  so  the 
second order dispersion may be large too as at IP so all over the ring. The suppression of the first 
order  dispersion  η1 = 0  is  only  performed  by  using  the  linear  lattice  elements  (bending  and 
quadrupoles).  To  suppress  the  second  order  dispersion  we  also  need  to  phase  the  sextupoles 
placed over azimuth with the non-zero first order dispersion, as appears from (9). 
 
The betatron frequencies and amplitude functions also depend on momentum deviation because 
of  changing  of  the  strengths  of  lattice  elements.  Those  dependences  are  characterized  by 
derivatives ∂Qx,z / ∂δ, ∂  2Qx,z / ∂δ2, …, ∂βx,z / ∂δ, …The changes of the betatron amplitudes and 
frequencies  cause  the  nonlinearity  of  the  betatron  motion.  In  this  connection  the  effective 
emittance  increases.  Besides,  the  nonlinear  dependence  of  the  betatron  tuning  on  momentum 
deviation

may  stimulate  betatron  resonances  even  if  natural  chromaticity  is  compensated  ∂Qy / ∂δ = 0.

That is why we need the possibility of the correction of nonlinear terms (10) in ring lattice. 

3.3. Longitudinal electron beam dynamics 
The  most  appropriate  scheme  of  LESR  is  the  raystrack  with  long  straight  sections  for  the 
placement of the injection system, RF-cavity and optical cavity (Fig.1)

M1-M2 are the optical mirrors, RFC is the RF-cavity. 
 
The long straight section with IP must be dispersion free, otherwise the CS intensity will be low. 
The  section  with  the  RF-cavity  must  be  also  dispersion  free,  otherwise  synchrobetatron 
resonances  will  be  excited  and  electron  beam  will  be  lost.  The  bending  angle  of  the  compact 
storage  ring  must  be  large  ϕВМ t π/2  and  as  a  result  the  dispersion  on  bending  exit  will  be 
approximately equal to bending radius η1 ≈ ρBM*(1-cos ϕBM) ≈ ρBM (for bendings with zero field 
index this expression is just correct). Consequently, the first order momentum compaction factor 
α1 will be large 

For  ring  with  C ≈ 15 m,  bending  radius  ρBM = 0.5 m  and  bending  angle  ϕBM = 90°  momentum 
compaction  factor  is  about  of  0.1.  The  RF-acceptance  at  large  RF-voltage  is  inversely 
proportional to square root from momentum compaction factor

where  VRF  is  the  RF-voltage,  h  is  the  harmonics  number.  For  example,  in  order  to  obtain 
acceptance  σRF = 5 %  we  need  VRF ≈ 1.18 MV  at  electron  beam  energy  E0 = 100 MeV, 
harmonics number h = 30 and momentum compaction factor α1 = 0.1. Thus, it is very important 
to minimize the momentum compaction factor at lattice design. 
 
Longitudinal electron beam size determining the CS intensity under non-head-on collision also 
depends on momentum compaction factor

Here  φs  is  the  synchronous  phase,  λRF  is  the  RF-wavelength.  For  example,  to  obtain  the 
longitudinal  beam  size  σs = 10 mm  under  energy  spread  δ = 0.5 %  and  above  described 
parameters  of  the  storage  ring  and  electron  beam  we  need  RF-voltage  VRF ≈ 2.1 MV.  It  is 
practically impossible to provide such voltage in compact storage ring, thus it is very important 
to reach the momentum compaction factor as small as possible. 
 
In case of both large momentum deviation and second order dispersion the quadratic term of the 
transversal  displacement  (7)  becomes  comparable  to  linear  one.  This  effect  causes  quadratic 
terms in orbit lengthening, in other words the momentum compaction factor becomes dependent 
on momentum deviation [6, 7]

Longitudinal motion equations taking into account quadratic terms of the orbit lengthening and 
neglecting damping of the oscillations are described as 

There are one stable fixed point φ = φs, δ = 0 in linear case α2 = 0 and one unstable fixed point 
φ = π - φs, δ = 0. The particles oscillate inside separatrix around stable fixed point. Quadratic on 
momentum  deviation  term  causes  additional  stable  φ = π - φs,  δ = - α1 / α2  and  unstable  fixed 
points.  The  beam  oscillating  inside  separatrix  around  φs  is  called  as  normal  beam,  the  beam 
oscillating around π - φs is called as anomalous one. The stable phase of the anomalous beam is 
located  on  the  RF-wave  flank  where  the  normal  beam  is  unstable.  Generally,  oscillations  are 
stable  if  dφ / dt  changes  sign  periodically  (the  first  equation  17).  In  case  of  the  normal  beam

α2δ2 << α1δ and derivative sign is changed because δ oscillates around δ = 0. In anomalous case 
one can see from (14) and first equation (17) that dφ / dt may change sign if δ oscillates around 
equilibrium  value  δ = - α1 / α2.  The  nature  of  the  phase  trajectories  is  strongly  dependent  on 
relation of linear and quadratic momentum compaction factors. Quantitatively those relations are 
described by the value of the critical quadratic momentum compaction factor

When  |α2| << α2C  the  phase  trajectories  of  the  normal  beam  are  similar  to  those  ones  in  linear 
theory.  The  trajectories  distort  and  the  asymmetry  of  the  separatrix  brunches  arise  when  |α2| 
increases. In the case of |α2| > α2C the separatrixes of the normal and anomalous beams become 
α - like (Fig.2). The energy acceptance is described as following

Thus, we need to control the second order dispersion over beam orbit in storage ring dedicated to 
keep the electron beam with large energy spread. Otherwise, it is impossible to provide the large 
RF-acceptance under operation mode with low momentum compaction factor. 

3.4. Intrabeam scattering (IBS) 
In  frame  bound  with  electron  beam  the  particles  oscillate  in  transversal  plane  and  they  may 
scatter one another. The longitudinal component of the particle pulse arises as a result of such 
collision.  When  this  component  is  large  the  colliding  particles  may  abort  from  separatrix  and 
may be lost (Touchek effect). The stochastic collisions with small transmitted pulses cause the 
emittances growth with corresponding times [8]. 
gr (nb, εx, εz, εs, γ), τz

gr (nb, εx, εz, εs, γ), τs
The  steady-state  transversal  and  longitudinal  emittances  are  formed  as  a  result  of  combined 
effect  of  the  IBS  and  radiation  cooling.  As  a  rule  the  vertical  emittance  is  determined  by

comparably to natural emittances, about of dozens and hundreds times. For example, in Fig.3 the 
dependences of the transversal and longitudinal emittances on electron beam energy in storage 
ring NESTOR designed at NSC KIPT are presented.

It  is  a  very  complicated  analytical  task  to  take  into  account  the  intrabeam  scattering  in  beam 
dynamics involving the Compton scattering because it is the consistent problem. We simulate the 
IBS by using the following algorithm: 
- the growth rates τy
beam emittances;  
- the simulating element is incorporated in ring lattice and angular coordinates and momentum 
deviation of the particle are changed in this element by using of matrix transformations 

gr, y = {x, z, δ) are computed before simulation over estimated range of the 

yfin′ = yini′*(1 + Trev / τy

gr), y′ = {x′, z′, δ) 

(22) 

During  simulation  the  growth  rates  are  corrected  in  accordance  with  the  beam  emittances.  If 
correction time is much less than growth rate we get the beam emittances coinciding well with 
analytical estimations. The results of the IBS simulation in storage ring NESTOR are presented 
in Fig.4.

The simulation parameters were following: 
•  electron beam energy Е0 = 75 MeV; 
•  particles number N = 400; 
• 
•  coupling coefficient κ = 0.05. 

stored bunch current Istor = 10 mA; 

The  coupling  of  the  transversal  oscillations  is  simulated  by  rotated  quadrupole  lens.  The 
horizontal  and  longitudinal  damping  times  at  simulation  energy  are  equal  to  1.36 s  and  0.7 s, 
accordingly, analytical estimations of the steady-state emittances are equal to εx = 1.54*10-6 and 
εs = 6.69*10-6. 

4.  Lattice  of  the  laser-electron  storage  ring  NESTOR.  Operation 
modes, electron beam and X-rays parameters 
Taking into account above stated we can formulate the main requirements for lattice of the ring 
dedicated to generation of the intense beam of the Compton scattered photons: 
•  amplitude functions at interaction point must be as small as possible; 
•  momentum compaction factor must be as small as possible, too; 
•  number of sextupoles in ring lattice must be enough to correct the chromatic effects and 

dynamics aperture. 

 
From  Fig.1  one  can  see,  that  we  can  decrease  the  momentum  compaction  factor  if  we  get  the 
negative dispersion function on beam orbit in bending magnet by using guadrupole lens between 
bendings.  In  this  case  one  long  straight  section  with  IP  will  be  dispersion  free,  dispersion 
function  on  opposite  straight  section  will  be  non-zero.  RF-cavity  is  placed  on  IP-drift,  the 
injection  system  is  placed  on  opposite  drift.  It  is  expediently  to  use  the  quadrupole  quadruplet 
with final triplet to focus the electron beam at IP. Such lattice allows us to get the minimal both 
horizontal and vertical amplitude functions at IP and to obtain the required drift length for RF 
and injection systems.  
 
It  is  expediently  to  use  the  separated  quadrupole  lens  in  ring  arc.  It  allows  to  guarantee  the 
appropriate conditions for chromaticity correction and to keep ring compactness. The bendings 
should be with non-zero field index in order to obtain the vertical focusing on ring arc. 
 
Taking  into  account  all  above  described  we  designe  the  lattice  of  storage  ring  NESTOR.  Its 
layout is presented in Fig.5. 
 
Bending  radius  and  bending  angle  are  equal  to  ρ = 0.5 m,  ϕВМ = 90°,  correspondingly,  field 
index  is  equal  to  n = 0.6.  The  maximal  magnetic  induction  is  equal  to  Вmax = 1.5 T  at  the 
maximal electron beam energy E0max = 225 MeV. The length of quadrupoles is equal to 150 mm, 
maximal  quadrupole  gradient  is  equal  to  Gmax ≈ 25 Т/m.  The  strong  sextupoles  effect  on  beam 
dynamics  similarly  octupoles.  To  correct  such  effect  four  combined  sextupole  lenses  with 
octupole fields are incorporated in ring lattice. The length of all sextupole and combined lenses 
is equal to 100 mm. The maximal length of the drift spaces is approximately equal to 1.2 m what 
allows  to  place  the  700 MHz  RF-cavity  and  injection  system  elements  on  those  drifts.  Ring 
circumference  is  equal  to  C = 15.418 m,  harmonics  number  is  h = 36  and  one  can  store 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36 bunches on beam orbit.

RF-cavity, Inflector is the injection kicker magnet, M1-M2 are the mirrors of the optical cavity. 
 
The  amplitude  functions  at  half  of  ring  lattice  are  presented  in  Fig.6  (ring  is  dissymmetrical 
relatively  interaction  point,  curves  begin  from  IP).  Different  focusing  on  IP-drift  and  opposite 
one (because dispersion functions on these drifts are different) causes insignificant asymmetry of 
the amplitude functions on arc and long straight sections. The less is the β-functions asymmetry 
the less are the amplitudes of the azimuthal perturbation harmonics and the more is the dynamics 
aperture of the ring. 
 
The first order dispersion function η1 at half of ring lattice is presented in Fig.7. We can obtain 
either  both  dispersion  free  long  straight  sections  or  one  of  them  by  controlling  the  separated 
quadrupole strength on ring arc. In first case we obtain the operation mode with large momentum 
compaction factor α1 = 0.078 (BM-mode). In second case dispersion function η1 is negative on 
orbit  in  one  of  the  arc  bendings  and  we  obtain  operation  mode  with  decreased  momentum 
compaction  factor  (LM-mode).  Dispersion  function  in  Fig.7  corresponds  to  α1 = 0.019.  The 
maximal value of the dispersion function on arc is equal to η1max ≈ 1.2 m, its maximal value on 
long straight section is equal to 0.3 m. The lattice is very flexible and it allows us to change the 
momentum compaction factor over wide range without betatron detuning and without essential 
change of the amplitude functions (we can decrease α1 down to zero and make it negative).  
 
In  LM-mode  the  first  order  dispersion  is  equal  to  zero  only  at  IP-drift  (approximately  on  one 
third of ring circumference), all other ring sections are not dispersion free. It allows us to place 
the  required  number  of  sextupoles  at  dispersion  sections  in  order  to  suppress  the  second  order 
dispersion η2 at IP and to minimize it at all ring. It is impossible to solve this problem in BM-
mode.  This  statement  is  illustrated  in  Fig.8  where  the  trajectories  of  the  particle  with  large 
momentum deviation in both operation modes are presented.

Fig.8. Horizontal phase trajectories of particle with large momentum deviation at IP azimuth in 
operation modes with large and low momentum compaction factor (α1 = 0.078 and α1 = 0.019, 
correspondingly). Initial particle coordinates are 
xini = zini = 0.1 mm, x′ini = z′ini = sini = 0, δini = 0.01 

 
In this figure one can see that particle trajectory in BM-mode depends essentially on momentum 
deviation and this effect causes growth of the effective emittance. Besides, in this mode electron 
beam may be slowly exited and may be lost on synchrobetetron resonances if the RF-cavity is 
placed at azimuth with non-zero dispersion. We observed this phenomenon in simulations. 
 
Particle trajectory in LM-mode depends insignificantly on momentum deviation. The quadratic 
dispersion at IP is practically suppressed (Fig.9) and the value of the second order momentum 
compaction  factor  is  small,  α2 = 0.38.  Its  critical  value  at  electron  beam  energy Е0 = 225 MeV 
and  RF-voltage  VRF = 0.3 MV  is  α2С = 0.33,  consequently  |α2| > α2C.  The  separatrix  of  the 
longitudinal  motion  in  these  conditions  is  presented  in  Fig.10.  One  can  see  in  this  figure  that 
separatrix  shape  is  distorted  because  for  even  such  small  second  order  momentum  compaction 
factor  the  quadratic  on  momentum  deviation  terms  strongly  disturb  electron  beam  dynamics. 
Nevertheless, the value of the RF-acceptance is more than 7% at maximal electron beam energy 
for such relations between linear and quadratic momentum compaction factors. 
 
The  electron  beam  motion  is  really  stable  over  the  momentum  deviation  range,  which  is 
determined in chosen lattice by nonlinear shift of the betatron frequencies of the particles with 
large amplitudes. Dependences of the betaron frequencies on momentum deviation are presented 
in Fig.11. We have obtained these dependences from beam dynamics simulation. In this figure 
one can see that betarton detuning becomes dangerous for momentum deviation δ > 3 % because 
particles  may  cross  the  great  number  of  the  resonances.  The  dynamics  simulation  of  such 
particles shows that betatron amplitudes increase and particles are lost. Nevertheless, such RF-
acceptance is sufficient for obtaining of the scattered beam intensity nγ ≈ 1015 / s over all electron 
beam energy range.

researches.  We  need 

to  use  electron  beam  with  energies  over 

Fig.11. Fractional part of betatron frequencies vs. momentum deviation. Betatron amplitudes at 
IP are xb = 1 mm, zb = 0.5 mm. Vertical dash line bounds range of stable beam motion for δ > 0. 
 
Biological  and  medical  studies  will  be  ones  of  main  application  of  LESR.  X-rays  with  photon 
energy about of 33 keV are needed for coronary angiography and electron beam energy about of 
43 MeV is needed to obtain such photons under head-on collision. X-rays with photon energies 
over range 6 keV < εγ <16 keV and with long-term stability of the intensity are needed for many 
biological 
range 
18 MeV < E0 < 30 MeV in order to generate such X-rays. The stable storage ring operation with 
intensive  electron  beam  is  practically  impossible  at  such  small  energies  because  of  IBS.  The 
dependences  of  the  horizontal  and  longitudinal  emittances  on  time  for  stored  bunch  currant 
Istor = 10 mA and electron beam energy E0 = 43 MeV are presented in Fig.12. The parameters of 
injected  beam  are  following:  bunch  charge  qb = 0.5 nC,  emittances  εx = εz = 10-7,  εs = 6*10-6. 
During 0.1 s between injection pulses horizontal and longitudinal emittance grow about of one 
order and three times, accordingly, what causes the essential decreasing of the X-rays intensity. 
The steady-state emittances are εx ≈ 5*10-6, εs ≈ 1.5*10-5 at coupling coefficient κ = 0.05. Under 
such  conditions  X-rays  intensity  is  approximately  1011 phot /s  and  such  intensity  is  not 
acceptable in angiographical studies. The problems drastically complicate under electron beam 
energy decreasing. 
 
To meet the requirements of the medical and biological studies we intend to use the following 
operation  modes  of  the  storage  ring.  Two  optical  cavities  with  the  length  Lres = λRF ≈ 430 mm 
will be placed inside of the final lenses of the quadruplet as it is shown in Fig.13. The crossing 
angles are equal to ϕ1 = 10° and ϕ2 = 150°. Under such lengths of the optical cavities we will be 
able  to  use  18  electron  bunches  of  the  storage  ring.  The  medical  photons  will  be  generated  at 
electron beam energy E0 ≈ 43 MeV and collision angle ϕ1 = 10°. Electron beam with non-steady-
state  size  will  be  used  in  this  mode.  In  order  to  achieve  the  high  average  X-rays  intensity 
(nγ ≥ 1012 / s)  electron  beam  will  be  injected  in  storage  ring  with  repetition  frequency 
finj = 10 Hz.  The  biological  photons  with  energy  over  range  6 keV < εγ <16 keV  will  be 

 

14

generated  at  electron  beam  energy  70 MeV < E0 < 120 MeV  and  collision  angle  ϕ2 = 150°.  Of 
course, X-rays intensity at such collision angle will be much less than the one at small collision 
angle.  Nevertheless,  this  intensity  quite  meets  the  requirements  of  the  biological  experiments. 
Besides, X-rays intensity will be very stable because we intend to use electron beam with steady-
state  parameters  (at  electron  beam  energy  about  of  100 MeV  IBS-effects  appear  low).  In  both 
operation modes we are going to use the neodymium laser with photon energy εlas = 1.164 eV.

Several following figures illustrate all above stated (all dependencies were calculated by electron 
beam  dynamics  simulation  in  chosen  lattice  involving  Compton  scattering).  The  computed 
intensity  of  the  medical  photons  during  injection  interval  is  shown  in  Fig.14,  spectrum  of  the 
scattered  photons  within  4π-solid  angles  is  shown  in  Fig.15.  The  average  intensities  during 
injection  interval  and  within  10  ms  period  just  after  injection  are  approximately  equal  to 
1.2*1012 phot /s  and  2*1012 phot /s,  accordingly.  The  spectral  brightness  under  laser  beam  size 

 

15

σlas = 40 µ is approximately equal to 5*1012 phot / (s*mrad*mm2*0.1%BW) and such brightness 
allows to carry out angiographic studies.  
 
The  collimated  spectrum  of  the  photons  for  biological  studies  with  maximal  energy 
εγmax ≈ 6.7 keV  (electron  beam  energy  E0 = 75 MeV,  collision  angle  ϕ = 150°)  is  presented  in 
Fig.16.  Total  Compton  beam  intensity  within  4π-solid  angle  is  approximately  equal  to 
nγ ≈ 1011 / s,  number  of  photons  within  collimation  angle  αcol = 1 mrad  is  nγcol ≈ 2.5*109 / s, 
spectrum width (FWHM) is approximately 10%, number of photons within 0.1%BW at maximal 
photon energy is nγBW ≈ 2.3*108 / s. Under laser beam waist σlas = 40 µ the spectral brightness is 
В ≈ 2*1011 / (s*mm2*mrad*0.1 % BW).  X-rays  with  such  parameters  quite  meet 
the 
requirements of biological studies. 
 
In  order  to  generate  hard  γ-quanta  we  intend  to  use  10°-collision  of  laser  photons  and  high-
energy  electron  beam  with  steady-state  parameters.  The  total  Compton  beam  intensity  at 
maximal  operation  energy  of  the  storage  ring  Е0max = 225 MeV  is  shown  in  Fig.17.  Maximal  
γ-quanta  energy  is  εγmax ≈ 900 keV  (εlas = 1.164 eV).  Insignificant  decreasing  of  the  scattered 
beam  intensity  is  caused  by  energy  spread  increasing  and  electron  bunches  lengthening  under 
Compton  scattering.  By  means  of  the  “green  laser”  (εlas = 2.328 eV)  we  will  be  able  to  obtain 
1.8 MeV  γ-quanta  energy.  Such  γ-quanta,  for  example,  may  be  used  for  neutron  generation  in 
beryllium target.

5. Summary 
The problems of the electron beam dynamics associated with large beam energy spread caused 
by intensive Compton scattering are solved in proposed lattice of the laser-electron storage ring. 
X-rays over energy range 6 keV ≤ εγ ≤ 900 keV with long-term stable intensity up to 1013 phot /s 
may  be  generated  under  realized  parameters  of  the  injector,  storage  ring  and  laser  system.

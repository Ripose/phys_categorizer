ABSTRACT: A key parameter underlying the existence of 
sonoluminescence [or ‘SL’] is the time relative to SL at which acoustic 
energy is radiated from the collapsed bubble. Light scattering is one route to 
this quantity. We disagree with the statement of Gompf and Pecha that -
highly compressed water causes the minimum in scattered light to occur 
700ps before SL- and that this effect leads to an overestimate of the bubble 
wall velocity. We discuss potential artifacts in their experimental 
arrangement and correct their description of previous experiments on Mie 
scattering. 

 
In sonoluminescence  the first stage of energy focusing is provided by 

the collapse of a gas bubble surrounded by water. For example a 40KHz 
sound field with an amplitude of 1.35atm will cause a helium bubble with an 
ambient radius of 4microns to expand to a maximum radius of 29 µ. Since 
the bubble contains 6.7x109 helium atoms and is acted on by about  1atm 
[=P0] of ambient external pressure the mechanical energy stored when the 
bubble is perched at its maximum radius is about 10.eV per helium atom[1].

Sonoluminescence [SL] is due to  some fraction of this potential energy 
being transferred into the thermal degrees of freedom of the relatively few 
atoms/molecules in the bubble as it implodes under the influence of P0 . For 
instance, if all the mechanical energy went into uniformly heating the 
helium, its temperature at the moment of collapse [when its radius 
approaches the van der Waals hard core of about .4 µ] would be about 
75,000K.  
 
A determination of the fraction of potential energy that remains in the 
bubble at the moment of collapse is a key aspect of SL. Thus the dynamics 
of the collapse is critical to an understanding of SL and so various 
techniques [2-10] have been applied to the experimental determination of the 
bubble radius as a function of time R(t) and the response of the water. 
Various realizations of Mie scattering [3-10] in particular have proved useful 
in obtaining bubble parameters. Mie scattering occurs when variations in the 
index of refraction cause light to be scattered out of the direction of the 
incident beam. 

In a recent paper [11] Gompf and Pecha [GP] have used a streak 

camera to image Mie scattering. In the abstract they claim that “In the last 
nanoseconds around minimum bubble radius most of the light is scattered at 
the highly compressed water surrounding the bubble and not at the bubble 
wall. This leads to a minimum in the scattered light intensity about 700ps 
before the SL pulse is emitted.”  They go on to say that “neglect this changes 
[sic] leads to a strong overestimation of the bubble wall velocity”.  

We disagree with a number of aspects of these statements. The 700ps 

interval which GP quote is specific to their particular experimental 
arrangement and is unrelated to the physics of a bubble collapsing in highly 
compressed water.  The stated timing resolution of GP is 500ps whereas by 

 

2 

the application of time correlated single photon counting to Mie scattering 
we have achieved a timing resolution of about 50ps. In Figure 1 of reference 
[8] the flash will be seen to occur 100-200ps before [not 700ps after ] the 
minimum apparent radius [i.e. ‘y’ axis], which for our experiment is the 
minimum in total light scattering.  We agree [8] that light scattering is due to 
the index of refraction changes at the wall of the bubble as well as the highly 
compressed water.  But in this case, attribution of the Mie scattering 
exclusively to the bubble wall would lead to an underestimate , of its 
velocity, not an overestimate , as quoted above from GP. Perhaps our 
observation that the flash precedes the minimum in light scattering could be 
due to this effect. 

On page 5254 GP discuss our previous experiments on Mie scattering 
[3,4,5] and state that “In ..former investigations .. the scattered light intensity 
was assumed to be proportional to the square of the bubble radius which 
totally neglects the complicated angular distribution of the Mie scattering.” 
This statement comprises an inaccurate description of past experiments. The 
complicated angular distribution can be seen in Figure 6 of [4], which was 
taken from our first paper on Mie scattering from SL [3]. One of the steps 
that enabled us to obtain quantitative information about bubble radii from 
Mie scattering was to simplify the scattered intensity as a function of R by 
collecting light from a large solid angle: such as 
[3]. In this case the intensity of light scattering is within 20% of R2 
46
for bubbles bigger than, .6 microns[8], or 1micron[3]. These corrections and 
their connection to the “complicated angular distribution of Mie scattering” 
were discussed in these papers. A plot typical of calculations that formed the 
basis for these corrections was published in ref. [8]. The strong deviations 
from R2 Mie scattering displayed in Figure 5 of GP results from their

collecting light in a small solid angle [
] near the forward direction. 
On page 5255 GP state that our papers neglected the effect of changes in the 
refractive indices. This is true; the index of refraction inside the bubble was 
reckoned to unity for the purpose of deconvolving the scattered intensity. 
Light scattering techniques have not yet reached the point where changes in 
the index of refraction, due to say the formation of a plasma, can be 
extracted. Analysis of our data also neglected the effect of bubble 
asphericity [see discussion relating to Figure 6 of ref.5]. 

The time scale of 700ps enters GP in two entirely different contexts: 
1) it is a “pronounced minimum in the scattered light intensity .7ns before 
the SL pulse due to Mie lobe clusters” and 2) “From this time on most of the 
light is scattered at the highly compressed water around the bubble leading 
to a strong increase in the scattered light intensity before minimum bubble 
radius” which is the moment of SL. For the choice of angles over which GP 
collect scattered light we agree with 1) but emphasize that our choice of 
angles eliminated this artifactual minimum. Regarding 2) we reiterate our 
disagreement with GP’s abstract.  

At more than one location in GP it is claimed that “the bubble wall 

velocity 1ns before the SL pulse is about 950m/s. This value is much lower 
than the values found by Weninger et al ”[reference 5 this comment]. First 
of all, the bubble wall velocity 1ns before collapse, where R is about 1.7 µ, 
is for our data 900m/sec [5]. So it would appear that GP have confirmed our 
measurements. Secondly, the 500ps timing resolution of GP means that a 
500ps smoothing function has been applied to their rapidly changing data. 
There can be no question that their value of 950m/s is an underestimate of 
the bubble wall velocity in their experiment. Furthermore, a statement 
claiming a significant discrepancy between experiments would have more 

 

4 

weight if it was accompanied by a discussion of ‘error bars’. The paper of 
GP contains no such discussion. We have attempted to give an example of 
our ‘error’ in Figure 6 of [5]. It has sources in the various processes 
discussed above, gas concentration, and also run to run variations.  

The data of GP for R(t) cut off at about 1.7microns up to which point 
they are largely in agreement with our previously published results[4,5,6]. 
There remains the issue of whether the bubble wall velocity for some 
systems [4,5,6] approaches higher velocities  [e.g. in excess of 1200m/s] for 
smaller radii. Systems are characterized by the gas mixture used, acoustic 
frequency and ambient temperature. [For 1%Xe 99%O dissolved at 150Torr 
driven at 40KHz at 20C, the maximum velocity was actually found to be less 
than 950m/s.(8)] In the range

or minimum radius, GP provide no data for R. They claim that this is due to 
the difficulty in subtracting out a large signal due to scattering from highly 
compressed water. Except for 200ps around the minimum we disagree. 
Based upon our experience we propose some possible complications that 
affect their experiment in this range; 1) the GP choice of angles leads to Mie 
lobes that are sufficiently complicated that the intensity of scattered light is 
not monotonic with radius, so that deconvolution is difficult, 2) as the GP 
images are magnified and averaged, small translational motion and 
concentric pulsation of the bubble can throw its image off the slit, 3) the 
level of scattered laser light is less than the intensity of SL obscuring 
dynamics near Rc.  In Figure 1 we show photos of SL from a bubble 
undergoing a spontaneous motion on the order of 10 µ. To the eye this 
particular bubble appears as stable as a star in the sky. When magnified by a 
factor of 10 this motion is enough to throw the image off the entry slit of the 

 

5 

streak camera and introduce errors into the data. For integrated Mie 
scattering [3,4,5,6] where the width of the incoming light beam [typically 
1mm] is larger than this motion and all the scattered light is delivered to a 
photo-detector the effects of this bubble motion can be minimized.  For this 
reason our investigations of imaged light scattering has been carried out on a 
shot by shot basis. In Figure 2 one sees a very common example of the 
bubble falling off the slit during that portion of the cycle that surrounds the 
minimum by about 1 ns as in GP. In Figure 2 the shrinking bubble is not 
centered on slit. 
 
It is good news that the action of an audible sound field on water has 
led to a debate about experimental techniques on the scale of 100ps-700ps. 
As the time scale is narrowed it will eventually be possible to determine the 
time relative to SL ‘ta-tsl’ at which acoustic energy is radiated by the bubble. 
This is very important because over 90% of the bubble’s potential energy is 
radiated as sound[1]. If ‘ta-tsl’ is negative then the average energy per 
particle at the moment of collapse is less than 1eV which is not high enough 
to explain the UV spectra [4] for a uniformly heated bubble[12]. Indeed if 
‘ta-tsl’ <0 the observation of SL would imply an additional energy focusing 
mechanism inside the collapsed bubble [13]. Perhaps the nonlinear processes 
that determine ‘ta-tsl’ are the key to the existence of SL.

FIGURE CAPTIONS 
 
1)  A  microscope  image  of  light  emission  from  a  sonoluminescing  bubble 
moving on the surface of a toroid of 15 µ radius. The bubble is formed from 
water which has a mixture of 1%He, 99%O2 dissolved under a pressure of 
150Torr.  The  acoustic  frequency  is  16.5KHz  and  the  exposure  time  is 
.8seconds. In contrast B) shows our most stable image of SL (150Torr 1%Xe 
in  O2  at  41KHz)  accumulated  over  700flashes.  The  1 µ  resolution  of  the 
diameter  is  limited  by  both  the  microscope  objective  and  possible  bubble 
motion. A range of motions between those displayed  in ‘A’ and ‘B’ may be 
seen  under  various  circumstances  which  in  general  are  beyond  our 
experimental  control.  The  intensity  of  SL  is  color  coded  so  that  red  is 
brightest. 
2) Single shot streak camera shadowgraph of a collapsing bubble launching 
a pulse of sound into the surrounding water [see ref.8 for experimental 
details]. The image of the bubble is the center line, and the radiated pulse of 
sound moves at a supersonic velocity relative to the speed of sound in water. 
The image of this particular bubble is lost during the indicated 1ns time-
span. This effect is due to the bubble not being centered on the entrance slit 
of the streak camera. As the bubble shrinks its shadow falls off the slit. A 
photo lacking this artifact can be found in [8]. This experiment was carried 
out at 41KHz with 150Torr 1%Xe, 99%O2.

ABSTRACT. 
 
The article sets forth comprehensive basics of thermodynamics of chemical equilibrium as balance 
of  the  thermodynamic  forces.  Based  on  the  linear  equations  of  irreversible  thermodynamics,  De 
Donder  definition  of  the  thermodynamic  force,  and  Le  Chatelier(cid:146)s  principle,  our  new  theory  of 
chemical  equilibrium  offers  an  explicit  account  for  multiple  chemical  interactions  within  the 
system. Basic relations between energetic characteristics of chemical transformations and reaction 
extents  are  based  on  the  idea  of  chemical  equilibrium  as  balance  between  internal  and  external 
thermodynamic forces, which is presented in the form of a logistic equation. This equation contains 
only  one  new  parameter,  reflecting  the  external  impact  on  the  chemical  system  and  the  system(cid:146)s 
resistance  to  potential  changes.  Solutions  to  the  basic  equation  at  isothermic-isobaric  conditions 
define  the  domain  of  states  of  the  chemical  system,  including  four  distinctive  areas  from  true 
equilibrium to true chaos.  
The  new  theory  is  derived  exclusively  from  the  currently  recognized  ideas  of  chemical 
thermodynamics  and  covers  both  thermodynamics,  equilibrium  and  non-equilibrium  in  a  unique 
concept, bringing new opportunities for understanding and practical treatment of complex chemical 
systems. Among new features one should mention analysis of the system domain of states and the 
area limits, and a more accurate calculation of the equilibrium compositions.  
 
INTRODUCTION. 
 
Contemporary  chemical  thermodynamics  is  torn  apart  applying  different  concepts  to  traditional 
isolated systems with true thermodynamic equilibriumi and to open systems with self-organization, 
loosely described as (cid:147)far-from-equilibrium(cid:148) area. This difference means that none of the currently 
recognized  models  allows  any  transition  from  one  type  of  system  to  another  within  the  same 
formalism. That(cid:146)s why applications of chemical thermodynamics to real objects often lead to severe 
misinterpretation of their status, giving approximate rather than precise results.  
If  a  chemical  system  is  capable  of  only  one  reaction,  the  reaction  outcome  is  defined  by  the 
Guldberg-Waage(cid:146)s  equation,  based  on  a  priori  probabilities  of  the  participants  to  interact.  The 
situation  gets  complicated  if  several  coupled  chemical  reactions  run  simultaneously.  In  such  a 
system  conditional  rather  than  a  priori  probabilities  constitute  the  Law  of  Mass  Action  (LMA).

possible reaction event on S, then defined by Bayes(cid:146) theorem a conditional probability rather than 
an a priori one should be placed into LMA, as it was discussed earlier on by the author [1]. In non-
ideal gases and solutions, chemical thermodynamics accounts for that implicitly, having introduced 
fugacities and thermodynamic activities [2]. They allow us to keep expressions for thermodynamic 
functions and equilibrium constants in the same appearance, disguising the open systems under the 
attire of isolated  entities. Another case, generally thought to be a remedy to the same problem,  is 
Gibbs(cid:146) approach to phase equilibria. It represents the system as a set of open different phase entities 
where  the  equilibrium  conditions  include  also  equality  of  chemical  potentials  in  addition  to  the 
traditional couple of thermodynamic parameters [3]. Actually this method is just an enhancement to

the originally poorly formulated Zeroth law of thermodynamics (for amended formulation see [4]).  
On the  opposite side  of the picture are open systems with self-organization and chaotic behavior, 
heavily investigated and described during last three decades. In Prigogine(cid:146)s approach [5], which is 
prevailing  in  the  field,  the  entropy  production  is  the  major  (if  not  the  only)  factor  to  define  the 
outcome  of chemical processes. Following this modus operandi actually  means  implicit reduction 
of thermodynamic functions to entropy. The (cid:147)entropic(cid:148) approach is considered by some authors to 
be more fundamental than the (cid:147)energetic(cid:148) [6,7] approach. It works well in case of (cid:147)weak(cid:148) reactions 
but is not capable to cover chemical transformations with very negative changes of free energy. 
We  do  not  know  any  serious  theory  trying  to  cover  consistently  both  wings  of  chemical 
thermodynamics. This work is an attempt to do so on the (cid:147)energetic(cid:148) basis, and offers a solution, 
that  unifies  both  thermodynamics  aspects  with  a  common  concept  in  a  unique  theory.  The 
preliminary results of this research were published in [8]. 
 
DEFINITIONS. 
 
We  have  to  define  some  new  values  and  redefine  some  of  the  known  values  as  well.  Consider 
chemical  reaction  νAA  +  νBB  =  νCC.  Let  ∆nA,  ∆nB,  ∆nC  be  the  amounts  of  moles  of  reaction 
participants,  transformed  as  reaction  proceeds  from  start  to  thermodynamic  equilibrium.  Obvious 
equalities follow from the law of stoichiometry 

∆nA/νA= ∆nB/νB = ∆nC/νC.                                                 (1) 

Let(cid:146)s define the thermodynamic equivalent of transformation (TET) in the j-reaction as  

ηj = ∆nkj/νkj .                                                            (2) 
where ∆nkj is the amount of moles of k-participant transformed in chemical reaction in j-system on 
0
its way from initial state to TDE. The numerical value of ηj holds information of the system(cid:146)s ∆Gj
 
and  initial  composition.  We  will  use  it  for  quantitative  description  of  the  chemical  systems(cid:146) 
composition. The above relations are strictly applicable, e.g., to reactions of species formation from 
elements. 
De Donder [9] introduced the reaction coordinate ξD in differential form as 

dξD = dnkj /νkj                                                          (3) 

with the dimension of mole. We re-define the reaction coordinate as  

dξZ = dnkj /(νkj ηj),                                                           (4) 
thus turning it into a dimensionless marker of equilibrium. The reaction extent ∆ξZ is defined as a 
difference between running and initial values of the reaction coordinate; obviously, the initial state 
is  characterized  by  ∆ξZ=0  while  in  TDE  ∆ξZ=1.  This  new  feature  allows  us  to  define  a  system 
deviation, or shift from equilibrium in finite differences  

(5) 
The  shift  sign  is  positive  if  reaction  didn(cid:146)t  reach  the  state  of  TDE,  and  negative  if  it  was  shifted 
beyond it. In the initial state, reaction shift δξZ=1 and δξZ=0 in TDE. The above quantities, related 
to  reaction  coordinate,  provide  a  great  convenience  in  equilibrium  analysis.    The  new  reaction 
extent is linked to the value defined by equation (3) as 

        δξZ=1−∆ξZ.                                          

 

∆ξZ = ∆ξD /ηj.                                                                   (6)  
Further on we will use exclusively ξZ omitting the subscript. In writing we will retain ∆j for reaction 
extent and δj for the shift.  
One of the pillars of this work is thermodynamic force; the author accepts Galileo(cid:146)s general concept 
of force as a reason for the changes in a system, against which this force acts [10]. Thermodynamic 
force (TDF) as a moving power of chemical transformations was introduced by De Donder [9] and 
was incorporated in chemical thermodynamics as a thermodynamic affinity  

Aj = − ((cid:240)Φj/(cid:240)ξj)x,y ,                                                             (7)

where  Φj  stands  for  any  of  major  characteristic  functions  or  enthalpy,  and  x,  y  is  a  couple  of 
corresponding  thermodynamic  parameters.  This  expression  defines  the  internal  affinity,  or 
eugenaffinity of the j-reaction. Substitution of ξD by ξZ makes the affinity dimension the same as the 
dimension  of  the  corresponding  function  in  equation  (7).  It  is  very  important  for  this  work  that 
affinity totally matches the definition of force as a negative derivative of potential by coordinate.

This  reaction  is  very  convenient  to  illustrate  major  ideas  and  results  of  this  work  due  to  large

GENERAL PREMISE AND THE BASIC EQUATION OF THE THEORY.   
 
In our theory derivation we proceeded from the following definitions and expressions: 
1.  Linear equations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with the affinities Aji for the internal and 
Aje for the external thermodynamic force related to the j-system are represented by equation  

  vj= aji Aji + Σ aje Aje,                                                       (9) 
            where vj is the speed of chemical reaction, and aji and aje are the Onsager coefficients [12]. It is more 
constructive to put down the system(cid:146)s interactions in the formalism of a dichotomial section 

 

 

 

vj= aji Aji + aje Aje ,                                                      (10) 
where  ajeAje  is  a  contribution  from  the  subsystem  compliment  [13].  Chemical  equilibrium  is 
achieved  at  vj=0,  that  clearly  corresponds  to  equilibrium  between  internal  and  external 
thermodynamic forces, causing and affecting the reaction in the j-system    

* = 0.                                                         (11) 
* + ojAje
The  dimensionless  ratio  oj=aje/aji  is  a  reduced  Onsager  coefficient.  One  should  point  out  that 
equation (11)  expresses the balance between all  generalized TDFs acting against the j-system;  its

first term is the bound affinity  equal to the shifting TDF [14]. Asterisks refer  values to chemical 
equilibrium. 
2.   De Donder(cid:146)s expression (7) for thermodynamic affinity.  
3.   Le Chatelier(cid:146)s principle. To use it, we suggest linearity between the reaction shift from TDE 
and external TDF (Fje) causing this shift to be  

δj = − (1/αj)Fje ,                                                            (12) 
where  αj  is just a proportionality  coefficient, and the  minus sign says that the system changes  its 
state to decrease impact of the external TDF. Recall that Fje is expressed in energy units; because δj 
has no dimension, the dimension of αj should also be energy.  
According to Le Chatelier(cid:146)s principle, state of the chemical system shifts from TDE until the bound

affinity  gets  equal to the TDF to  minimize  or nullify  its impact, i.e.  αjδξj
this  substitution  and  Aji
x,y  into  the  condition  of  chemical  equilibrium  (11),  and  after 
multiplying both sides by ∆j we obtain

This is the basic equation of the new theory. In an isolated system with Fje= 0 we have its reduced 
form, which is merely the traditional expression for equilibrium. Equation (13) is a typical logistic 
*)  [].  It  describes  chemical  equilibrium  in  chemical  systems  interacting  with 
map  f(δj)=αj  δj
their environment; its reduced form is related to the TDE of chemical reactions isolated from their 
environment. It covers all virtually conceivable systems and situations, and, as we show  later on,  
its second (parabolic) term causes a rich variety of behavior up to chaotic states.

ratio  of  the  concentration  function  value  under  external  impact,  to  the  same  ratio  for  the  isolated

defines the (cid:147)growth(cid:148) of deviation from TDE; like in the Verhulst model, its numerator depends on 
external impact on the system (the (cid:147)demand for prey(cid:148) in populations [17]) while the denominator 
(RT) is a measure of the system resistance to changes.  
 
THE DOMAIN OF STATES OF THE CHEMICAL SYSTEM. 
 
Parameter τj plays a critical role in the fate of dynamical systems, controlling their evolution from 
total extinction to bifurcations and chaos. The dependence between the reduced chaotic temperature

In  the  case  of  a  chemical  system  this  diagram  represents  its  domain  of  states.  For  example, 
bifurcation diagram for the system with reaction (8) at constant p and T is shown in Fig.2.  
It is commonly accepted in the population growth theory that 0<δj<1. Unlike populations, chemical 
equilibrium  may  experience shifts to both  ends, towards reactants  or products; therefore  it  makes 
sense  also  to  admit  δj<0.  To  illustrate  this  statement,  the  two-way  bifurcation  diagram  with  the 
shifts from TDE towards the initial mixture and towards the exhausted reacting mixture is shown in 
Fig.3. The state diagram has 4 clearly distinguishable areas, typical of bifurcation

and  Fig.3.  First  follows  the  area  with  zero  deviation  from  TDE,  where  the  curve  rests  on  the

iterates:  chemical  equilibrium  as  a  display  of  TDE  totally  fits  itself  as  a  display  of  the 
thermodynamic  force  balance.  The  second  is  the  area  of  the  open  equilibrium  (OPE)  where  the

*≠0 and multiple states comes out. It smoothly heads to chaos (the last, 4th area 
multiple values of δj
of  the  diagram,  not  shown)  with  increase  of  τj.  The  magnitude  of  τj  in  the  chemical  system 
designates the system(cid:146)s position in its domain of states and defines its shift from TDE.

Interestingly enough, the area limits - τTDE, τOPE and τB2 (the limit of the period 2 bifurcations area,

and biochemical systems) the bifurcations area may be of more importance. The limit value of τTDE 
is unity when ηj tends to zero. We didn(cid:146)t find bifurcations in the δj
The least expected and the most unusual result of the new theory is that the TDE area is not a point 
but  may  be  stretched  out  pretty far  towards  the  open  systems  with  τj  >1,  up  to  a  certain  critical 
value of the reduced chaotic temperature. Being unaware of any experimental proof of it, we have 
found some analogies using traditional way. Fig.5 shows the results of thermodynamic simulation 
for  the  equilibrium  reacting  mixture  in  the  reaction  of  the  double  oxides  nCaO·mRO  and 
nBaO·mRO with sulfur, carried out at T=298 K on homological series of double oxides varying RO

THE PROOF OF THE THEORY PREMISES. 
 
The only new suggestion we used to derive the basic equation is expression (12); now we will show 
its reasonability. As it was mentioned above, in chemical equilibrium the reaction affinity mirrors 
the external TDF. The graphs in Fig.7 were plotted for some simple cases based on the calculations

reactions,  and  the  simulation  was  carried  on  as  described  in  the  previous  chapter.  The 
difference between the curve slopes for CaO·RO in Fig.5 and Fig.8 is due to the different 
values taken as arguments to plot the curves.  Linear dependence of δj* on TDF in Fig.8 is 
without any doubts. The restricting oxides  for simulation were, in order as they  follow as 
the dots on graphs, SiO2, Fe2O3, TiO2, WO3, and Cr2O3.  
The  above  observations  are  proving  the  premise  of  the  theory,  and  are  closely  related  to  the 
problem of finding the τj value for practical needs. 
 

AREA LIMITS AND CHARACTERISTIC REDUCED CHAOTIC TEMPERATURE. 
 
The new theory of chemical equilibrium presented above covers all conceivable cases (cid:150) from true 
equilibrium to true chaos. The system location in the domain of states is controlled by the new (and 
only) parameter of the theory (cid:150) reduced chaotic temperature.  What does it change in the chemical 
system analysis and simulation compared to the traditional approach? If the system characteristic τj 
value falls in [0,τTDE] one should use conventional methods to calculate equilibrium composition at 
∆Gj=0.  Else,  if  τj>τTDE  equation  (16)  should  be  used.  So,  we  should  know  the  area  limits  and 
characteristic τj value for the system in question.  
The  area  limits  may  be  found  by  direct  computer  simulation  given  initial  composition  and 
thermodynamic parameters, using iteration algorithms to solve equation (16) as described in many 
sources  (e.g.,  [16])  exactly  as  it  was  done  in  the  course  of  this  work.  On  the  other  hand  there  is 
another time/labor saving opportunity, and the limits, τTDE and τOPE can be calculated with a good 
precision  avoiding  any  simulation.  For  the  first  of  them,  recall  that  equation  (16)  contains  2 
*=0  (Fig.9)  in  the 
functions,  logarithmic  and  parabolic.  Both  have  at  least  one  joint  point  at  δj
beginning of the reference frame, providing for a trivial solution to equation (16) and retaining the 
system within the TDE area. The curves may cross somewhere else at least one time more; in this 
case the solution will differ from zero and number of the roots will be more than one. There is no 
intersection if

There are several different ways to find τj within the frame of phenomenological theory. We have

already  touched  one  of  them,  based  on  the  bound  affinity  where  the  sought  value  can  be  found 
directly from equation (18)

In a certain sense it is better to find τj as an average of the curve tangents on the graph like in Fig.6. 
* 
An alternative method consists in finding the equilibrium composition and the appropriate ηj and δj
values  in  the  homological  series  by  varying  the  external  TDF.  We  have  already  described  this 
method (see Fig.8), additional illustration to it is given in Fig.11. We have also explored a method 
of  traditional  equilibrium  calculations  with  artificial  assignment  of  non-unity  coefficient  of 
thermodynamic  activity  to  any  system  participant.  Such  an  approach  means  a  restriction  on  the 
reacting ability of this participant and is based on the following reasoning. It was already mentioned 
that in the current paradigm interaction with the environment is accounted by means of excessive

No surprise that parameter τj took a great deal of attention in this work (cid:150) who knows the τj value, 
rules the chemical system. The major feature, as we see it at the moment, is that if the characteristic 
value of τj falls in [0, τTDE] one has to use conventional equilibrium conditions rather than equation 
(16). For instance, the values of τj and τTDE for the system with reaction (16) at p,T=const and initial

reactant amounts (1, 1, 0) are juxtaposed in Fig.13. In this example, the characteristic τj value was 
found as average for the linear part of the force-shift curve similar to the curves plotted in Fig.7; it 
falls  within  the  TDE  limit.  The  area  of  linearity  is  matching  the  loosely  defined  (cid:147)close  to 
equilibrium(cid:148)  region,  and  the  TDE  approximation  is  good  enough  there  for  the  chemical  system 
analysis.  However, we cannot offer a perfect universal method to calculate τj for any reaction. 
Needless  to  say  that  prior  to  finding  τj  one  has  to  find  ηj  for  the  reaction  in  question  at  given 
temperature. It can be done by any simulation method for thermodynamic equilibrium (at δj

solutions lead to bifurcation diagram as shown in Fig.14. Area limits in this diagram are the 
same  as  found  earlier  for  reaction  (8).  Obviously,  the  TDE  area  is  equipotential;  the 
system(cid:146)s equilibrium state and Gibbs(cid:146) free energy are independent on the external impact.  
Though one can see well-pronounced fork bifurcations, the gaps between Gmax and Gmin are 
very  small,  averaging  only  4.3  %  of  the  larger  value.  For  reaction  (8)  it  seems  like  the 
fork(cid:146)s  opposite  energy  levels  are  nearly  degenerated  and  the  system  can  easily  switch 
between  them.  For  instance,  that  may  create  a  kind  of  a  frame  for  the  system(cid:146)s  chemical 
oscillations under the influence of a non-periodic external force (for example, see [19]).

CONCLUSIONS. 
 
This  work  has  showed  explicitly  that  chemical  equilibrium,  treated  as  a  system  phenomenon, 
originates  from  the  balance  of  internal  and  external  thermodynamic  forces  which  are  ruling  the 
system from within or outside. Following from such an approach the basic equation of the theory is 
a logistic equation, containing traditional for chemical systems logarithmic term and a new, typical 
for logistic equations parabolic term. Solutions to the basic equation define the domain of states of a 
chemical system. Chemical equilibrium matches true thermodynamic equilibrium within an initial 
restricted  area  of  the  domain.  Within  that  area,  the  parabolic  term  equals  to  zero  and  the  basic 
equation  of  the  theory  matches  the  traditional  condition  of  thermodynamic  equilibrium  for  a 
chemical  reaction,  or  for  an  isolated  chemical  system.  Outside  the  area,  one  has  to  deal  with  an 
open chemical system, where chemical equilibrium differs from classical isolated model. When the 
thermodynamic branch looses stability, the chemical system encounters bifurcations and chaos. The 
system(cid:146)s  position  in  its  domain  of  states  is  defined  by  a  new  parameter,  the  reduced  chaotic 
temperature, which is a fraction where the numerator is proportional to the external impact on the 
system  and  the  denominator  reflects  system(cid:146)s  resistance  against  changes  and  merely  equals  to 
traditional  RT.  Application  of  the  new  theory  to  practice  needs  knowledge  of  that  parameter; 
several suitable methods to find it are discussed in this work. 
Major  advantage  of  the  new  theory  consists  in  extremely  generalized  presentation  of  external 
thermodynamic  forces.  Second,  results  of  this  work  make  it  much  less  essential  to  distinguish 
between isolated and open systems and to draw an explicit border between them; on the calculation 
level  the  difference  is  automatically  accounted.  Introduced  in  this  work  the  thermodynamics  of 
chemical  systems  unites  all  known  features  of  chemical  systems  on  a  common  basis  (cid:150)  from  true 
equilibrium to true chaos.

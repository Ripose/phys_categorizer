Using an exact solution for the pair interaction potential, we show that long, rigid, chiral
molecules with helical surface charge patterns have a preferential interaxial angle ~  RH L
where L is the length of the molecules, R is the closest distance between their axes, and H is the
helical pitch. Estimates based on this formula suggest a solution for the puzzle of small interaxial
angles in a -helix bundles and in cholesteric phases of DNA.

The existence of all living things depends on the molecular chirality of helices inside
them. Chiral amino acids form chiral a -helices that self-assemble into structural domains of
many proteins. Chiral DNA forms cholesteric liquid crystals right inside living cells [1].

Chiral interactions between biological helices present many puzzles [2]. In the cholesteric

phase (Fig. 2), DNA molecules rotate by a fraction of a degree from layer to layer [1]. Their
interaxial angle is much smaller than expected [3], and so is the angle between long a -helices in
proteins and in membranes. This produces a macroscopic cholesteric pitch, ~0.4-5 m m in DNA
[1] and even larger in cholesteric assemblies of a -helices in organic solvents [4]. One of the
challenges of the physics of chiral macromolecules is to understand how the interaxial angle is
encoded in intermolecular interactions [3].

Fig. 1 A simplified, heuristic model of interaction between
two long, net-neutral helical macromolecules in a nonpolar
environment. On the left, the molecules are shown
schematically by solid lines, their electric fields by light gray
shading, and the overlap (interaction) area by dark gray
shading. On the right, a small fragment of the overlap area is
magnified in a side view. We assume that the molecular
surface charge pattern is composed of one negatively and one
positively charged, thin spiral lines shifted with respect to
each other by approximately one half of the pitch. To describe
the position of the strands on each helix (n =1,2), we use the
axial distance zn  between the positively charged strand on
each molecule and the x-axis connecting the points of the
closest approach between molecules (as shown for molecule 2
on the right). At z1=z2, the positively charged strand of one
molecule opposes the negatively charged strand of the other
molecule creating a strong attraction. We assume that the
molecules cross each other approximately in the middle.

In the present paper, we suggest an explanation for the small angle puzzle. We start from

a heuristic model of interaction between two long, net-neutral helices in an electrolyte-free
environment (Fig. 1). We present qualitative arguments followed by rigorous derivations based
on an exact solution for the interaction potential. We apply the model to a -helix bundles in
proteins and address the origin of the cholesteric pitch in DNA, extending our ideas to
multimolecular interaction in an electrolyte solution.

Balance of forces. Consider two identical, right-handed, rigid, net-neutral helices (Fig. 1)

Each helix produces an electric field that decays as exp(-gr) with the distance r away

from it (g=2p /H) [5]. The electric fields overlap over the length Leff(y

Interaction between a -helices in proteins. Many proteins incorporate bundles of a -
helices. The backbone of each a -helix contains a spiral of negatively charged carbonyl oxygens
and a shifted spiral of positively charged amide hydrogens. In terms of the charge distribution, it
resembles the heuristic model analyzed above where a» 2.3 Å, H» 5.5 Å, L/H» 3-10, R» 7-12 Å
[9,10], Z» 1.7 (~0.5e0 per carbonyl or amide, ~3.5 groups per helical turn), and e
» 2 (lB» 300 Å).
For such helices, we find y
*~0.1-0.5 rad (7-30 deg).

Of course, amino acid side chains impose packing constraints that affect interaxial angles

and play a major role in determining the structure of a -helix bundles in proteins [9]. Still,
electrostatic interaction between backbones of a -helices that do not have bulky side chains (R» 7-
8 Å) is energetically significant (E*~2-5 kBT) and it may be an important player as well [11]. For
instance, steric interactions define a set of preferential interaxial angles rather than a single angle
[9]. Electrostatics may then determine which angle from the set is most favorable. It may not be a
coincidence that the average observed angle (~19 deg [9]) is in the middle of the range predicted
for chiral electrostatic interactions.

300 mM salt form a cholesteric phase (see Fig. 2) at 32 Å<R<49 Å [12,13]. Such DNA
fragments are short enough to behave as rigid rods [14] and long enough to have many helical
turns, L/H» 15.

Fig. 2 Alignment of DNA helices in the cholesteric
phase. Left: A sketch of the cholesteric phase that
consists of layers of parallel molecules. Each layer is
slightly rotated with respect to the layer underneath.
Right: Top view of a molecular layer showing most
favorable alignments of molecules in the layer above
(black rods): (1) when molecules are homogeneously
charged and (2) when molecules have helical patterns of
fully balanced surface charges.

Direct measurements of intermolecular forces demonstrated that the energetics of this

cholesteric phase is determined primarily by electrostatic interactions [15]. The interactions are
essentially pairwise since each DNA helix overlaps with only one molecule in the layer below it
[16]. Furthermore, only nearest neighbor pairs contribute to the energy because of the rapid,
exponential decay of the field.

The net interaction between each two molecules can be viewed as a sum of two forces.

The first one is a repulsion due to the fraction of DNA charge not balanced by bound or
condensed counterions (~20-25% of "naked" DNA charge [17]). This repulsion is the same as
between homogeneously charged cylinders in an electrolyte solution [6]. It favors parallel (y =0)
alignment of helices in a multimolecular ensemble (Fig. 2) because this maximizes
intermolecular separation and reduces the repulsion [2,18].

The second force is due to the compensated part of DNA charge. At optimal molecular

alignment, it is an attraction between negatively charged phosphate strands on one molecule and
positively charged grooves on the opposing molecule [5,6,19]. The physics of this force is the
same as in our heuristic model (Fig. 1), but some details are different. Specifically, DNA is a
double-stranded helix and it has a more complicated surface charge pattern than in Fig. 1 [20]. In
addition, electrolyte reduces the decay length of the electric field from g
where k D
[6], but for order-of-magnitude estimates they can be neglected. From Eqs. (11), (12), where
L» 500 Å, a» 10 Å, H» 34 Å, R~40 Å, |Z|» 40 [21], and lB» 7 Å (e

~5 m m [1,12,13]. Also in agreement with experiments [12,13], the pitch should not depend much
on the salt concentration at 10-300 mM salt. Indeed, since g» 0.2 Å-1,  P

DNA molecules much longer than one persistence length also form a cholesteric phase

page: 5

with about the same pitch as 500 Å fragments [1]. In this case, the theory is more complicated
since our description of molecules as straight, rigid rods does not apply. However, assuming that
each molecule behaves as a collection of independent, one-persistence-length-long fragments
[14], we can explain the observations.

Thus, the macroscopic cholesteric pitch in DNA aggregates may have the following

origin. When tips of one-persistence-length long DNA fragments are separated (in lateral
projection) by more than g-1, the attraction between negatively charged phosphate strands and
positively charged grooves tends to reduce y
associated with the uncompensated charge of DNA also tends to reduce y
overpower the chiral torque, reducing the separation of the tips and resulting in the pitch
2
~0.4 m m. A more detailed theory, based on the same ideas, also
shows why the chiral torque may disappear at R£ 32 Å (a possible solution for the puzzle of
nematic-to-cholesteric transition at R=32 Å) and it demonstrates that the direction of the chiral
torque can be reversed upon a change in counterion binding pattern or in separation [6].

In conclusion, let us emphasize that the goal of this letter is to illustrate on a conceptual
level why chiral helical molecules may not twist more than a couple degrees in the cholesteric
phase of DNA and in bundles of long a -helices. Of course, estimates are not a substitute for an
accurate statistical theory that accounts for the pair potential between helices of finite length and
for thermal motion. They are intended only to pave the way. The agreement with experiments
indicates, however, that we may be on the right track.

[20] In the absence of counterion chemisorption, one should speak of an excess negative charge on
phosphate strands and an excess positive charge in grooves separating the strands, rather than of a fixed
charge pattern like in Fig. 1. Quantitatively, this excess may vary with the counterion nature, but most
monovalent counterions do exhibit a preference to reside in grooves (see e.g. [V.N. Bartenev, E. I.
Golovanov, K.A. Kapitonova, M.A. Mokulskii, L.I. Volkova, and I. Ya. Skuratovskii, J. Mol. Biol., 169,

of the counterion adsorption (condensation) pattern may have a strong effect on the absolute value of the
energy of chiral interactions, but not on the most energetically favorable angle between helices [6].
[21] Two phosphate strands contribute 20 elementary charges per pitch. Their electrostatic images on the
nonpolar dielectric core of DNA effectively double the charge to Z~40.
[22] In 1:1 electrolytes, the first force is stronger than the second one resulting in net repulsion between
molecules [19]. Still, the first, non-chiral force produces no torque at y =0 (as it follows from symmetry).
The second, chiral force does produce a torque at y =0. In terms of their effect on the interaxial angle, the
second force is dominant at |y

Abstract

A simple and universal criterion was obtained for the thermal radiation energy loss

efficiency by small conductive particles which include along with metals and graphite also most

practically important metal carbides like tungsten carbide, titanium carbide and the number of

others.

expected.

In recent years the amount of research in the field of nanotechnology, nanomaterials and

nanosystems tremendously increased [1]. One of the most important trends in nanotechnology

is obtaining and using of nanopowders, which can be used in metallurgy, microelectronics,

medicine and food industry. Production of nanopowders and processing are frequently dealt

with heating of nanoparticles to high temperatures when intensive thermal radiation can be

In the recent times the great interest increased to dust plasma [2], and to the role of dust

in fusion devices [3], where micro- and nano- particles are heated to high temperatures and in

the energy balance of particles radiation energy losses can play decisive role.

For the calculation of nanoparticle energy balance the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black

body radiation of the sphere can not be used, because for dimensions of the particles smaller

than radiation length the Stefan-Boltzmann formula gives too overestimated results. Radiation

losses for atomic clasters were discussed in the review [4].

For the calculation of a small body energy loss the Kirchhoff 's law of thermal emission

can be used [5]. Thermal emission of the body with the temperature T  in the interval of angular

frequencies  dω   equals

According to [5], radiation absorption cross section for the sphere with the volume  V  can be

In the case of conductors the magnetic susceptibility prevails, that is why it is only taken into

account and used in the calculations used.

Although in the frame of G. Mie theory, the most profound approach to the scattering

and absorption of electromagnetic radiation on small particles, it is not possible to obtain

sufficiently common dependencies for cross section on parameters of particles [6], in the case of

conducting spheres the approximate approach can be used which is based on the account of the

depth of  penetration of the radiation in the substance [5]. In the frame of the approach the

Due to above mentioned asymptotic  J(p)~1/p in the case of large particles the dependence

normalized intensity on radius disappears and on the temperature becomes weak. Residual

temperature dependence can be accounted for not perfect accuracy of the model for absorption

of radiation by conducting balls at high temperatures.

The dependence of normalized  emissivity (“blackness”) I/Ib  on radius of a particle  r0

at temperatures  T=1773 °K, 1273 °K and 773 °K for micro particles of copper with account

for temperature dependence of conductivity of the material [9]  is shown on Fig.3. The similar

results for micro particles of graphite at temperatures T= 2773 °K, 2273 °K, 1273 °K and

773 °K  are shown on Fig. 4.

on spherical particles dimensions looks like qubic dependence of normalized cross section of

absorption on radius of nano particles and leads to constant value for large radii particles that

coincides with the values given in reference books. For molten cooper at temperatures 1100 –

1300 °С “blackness” equals 0.13-0.15 [7], that is in a good agreement with calculations for

particles with the radius greater than 1 µm (see Fig. 3). For graphite at temperature 500 °С

“blackness” equals to 0.71 [8], that agrees with the results in the frame of chosen model of

emitting conducting balls. Overestimated results of emissivity of graphite at elevated

temperatures should be explained by certain inaccuracy of the model. The model is valid for

 [6], which

taken into account should result in better agreement with experiments for big radii of the

particles at elevated temperatures. It is also worth noting that in a practically important case of

metal carbides the criterion is of the validity of the approach is well satisfied.

For both examples of copper and graphite considerable decrease of emissivity for

particles compared with Stephan-Boltzmann black body law for small radii shown on Fig.3 and

4 takes place near the value of dimensionless parameter 

1≤p

. So the dimensionless parameter

p=(r0/c)⋅(2πσkT/h)½ characterizes emissivity of small conducting particles depending on their

dimension and conductivity.

It is worth noting that the emissivity of nano particles being small compared to black

body is greater than emission of the same amount of gas and thus can be used as a light

source[4].

In the case of dielectric particles it is not possible to develop rather simple dependence

of cross section of absorption of the radiation on the radius of the spherical particle. But due a

number of results based on the G. Mie theory for scattering and absorption of the

electromagnetic wave on spherical absorbing particles [6], it is possible to conclude that cross

section of the absorption weakly varies for wavelengths

CONCLUSION

Efficiency of energy loss by hot conducting particles which include apart metals and

graphite also the most practically important metal carbides like tungsten carbide, titan carbide

and a number of others which have high conductivity [10], strongly depends on their

dimensions. For dimensions smaller than the wavelength of the maximum of the spectrum of

thermal emission efficiency depends on temperature T , and on conductivity σ  of the substance

of the particle. The universal criterion  p=(r0/c)⋅(2πσkT/h)½ > 1 allows determine the range

where the Stefan-Boltzmann law can be used for emission losses of small conducting particles

for dimensions smaller than

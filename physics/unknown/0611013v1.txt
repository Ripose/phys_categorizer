Abstract 
 
I consider model for flares proposed by P.-G de Gennes (PNAS, 101 (44), 15778-
15781,  2004)  and  suggest  a  range  for  amplification  factor  (  I  )  for  inhibitory 
neurons for the time evolution of non-divergent generations of excitatory neurons 
which  eventually  die  out.  The  exact  numerical  solution  of  the  model  for  the 
suggested  range  of  the  factor  (  I  )  then  provides  minimum  number  of  neurons 
describing size ( M  ) for memory objects. The obtained size is M = 8 to 12.75 and 
which is larger than the size M = 2 to 4 as obtained theoretically by de Gennes. 
 

 
Almost  two  years  ago,  de  Gennes  [1]  presented  a  tentative  and  schematic  picture  of  the 
olfaction storage system in early mammalians. Within the framework of the picture, each odor 
is stored inside a small cluster of neurons which are excited, not all at once, but in steps as the 
flare  of  excitation  generated  at  E0  neurons  travels  on  the  network  of  neurons.  The  flare  of 
excitation, initiated by an odor through sequence of mechanisms in nasal epithelium, olfactory 
bulb, lateral olfactory tract, piriform cortex and subsequent initial excitations of E0 neurons in 
storage area, eventually dies out in realistic systems. The neurons affected or excited by a flare 
caused by a particular odor, before it dies out, are supposed to be storing information about that 
odor.  And the number of excitatory neurons represents the size M of the memory object for the 
odor.  For  analyzing  flares,  de  Gennes  suggested  a  model,  following  an  argument  given  by 
Abeles [2], for time evolution of population of excitatory neurons having amplification factor ( 
E  )  which  are  simultaneously  suppressed  by  the  inhibitory  neurons  (typically  20%  of  the 
population) having amplification factor ( I ). His theoretical analysis yielded M = 2 to 4.  
 
Here  I  present  an  analysis  of  de  Gennes  model  and  show  that  a  range  of  real  values  for 
amplification factor for inhibitory neurons ( I ) can be fixed for a given value of amplification 
factor for  excitatory neurons ( E ) so as to have stable realistic system. Then based on exact 
numerical solutions of the model equations for this range of values, I suggest minimum number 
of  excitatory  neurons  within  a  flare  initiated  by  excitation  of  E0  neuron  at  time  t  =  0.  This 
minimum number of neurons representing size M of a memory object for an odor turns out to 
be larger than the number as suggested by de Gennes.  
 
Analysis of Local Flares 
 
Consider Ek and Ik as number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively, at generation k 
and  let  E0  and  I0  are  number  of  excitatory  and  inhibitory  neurons,  respectively,  at  time  t=0 
when k=0. Following de Gennes [1] we can write populations of these neurons at later times t0, 
2t0, . . ., kt0 as 
 

ek = 0.8 E ek-1 – I ik-1   with  ek = Ek/E0,   ik = Ik/E0

(2) 

ik =  0.2 E ek-1 . 

ek = 0.8 E ek-1 – 0.2 I E ek-2 

and 
 
 
Here  E  and  I  are  amplification  factors  for  excitatory  and  inhibitory  neurons,  respectively. 
Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we obtain 
 
 
 
and for which an exponential solution 
 
 
 
yields 
 
 
 
where x may be real or complex number. It should be noted that when x is real and less than 
one,  Eq.  (4)  suggests  non-divergent  solution  for  generations  of  excitatory  neurons  which 
eventually die out. For a given E and I, Eq. (5) has two roots x- and x+, given by 
 

x2 - 0.8 E x + 0.2 E I  = 0 

ek = u xk    

(3) 

(4) 

(5) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

x- = 0.4 E - (0.16 E2 – 0.2 E I)1/2 

x+ = 0.4 E + (0.16 E2 – 0.2 E I)1/2. 

Now  we  discuss  different  cases  which  lead  us  to  find  range  for  I  for  stable  realistic 

 
and  
 

 

system. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i)  Case I: The condition for both the roots being real is  
 
 

I  ≤   0.8 E  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
and for I = 0.8 E both roots are identical and given by 
 
 
 
 
x+ = 1.0 can be given by  
 

x- = x+ = 0.4 E .

and for this  I = I*

(10) 

            (9) 

(ii) Case II: When 0.4 E < 1 and both the roots are real, the value of I = I* which makes 

x- = 0.8 E – 1 .  

 

           (11) 

            I* <  I   ≤  0.8 E 

 
So for I > I*, both the roots will be less than one and the exponential solution ek = u xk suggests 
that ek will not diverge. This along with inequality (8) suggests the range for I as 
 
 
 
for non-divergent solution for generations ek, and for E = 1.8 it yields 
 
 
 
 
values for I and the number of excitatory neurons Nj up to generation  j , i.e. 
 

Now  for  this  range  of  I,  model  Eqs.  (1)  and  (2)  are  solved  numerically  for  different 

1.2222 <  I   ≤  1.44 .

is plotted against j in Fig. 1 for initial conditions e0 = 1, i0 = 0.25 representing existence of 20% 
of inhibitory neurons at t = 0. Similar results are also plotted in Fig. 2 but for initial conditions 
e0 = 1, i0 = 0 representing absence of inhibitory neurons at the initial time t = 0. It should be 
noted that

which represents the total number of excitatory neurons during the flare which is initiated by 
the  excitation  of  E0  neurons  at  time  t  =  0.  Within  the  framework  of  de  Gennes  [1],  this  M 
represents size of a memory object when E0 = 1. The Fig. 1 suggests that minimum value for 
 occurs for I  = 1.44 and thus for E0 = 1 minimum value for M  ≅  8.  I should 
lim ∞→j
mention  that  the  computation  for  I  >  1.44,  e.g.  I  =  1.441,  produces  negative  values  for  ek  at 
later stage of time and thus 1.44 is the higher limiting value for I for realistic situation. Further, 
results presented in Fig. 2 suggest minimum values for M as 12.75 when E0 = 1. This increase 
in  M,  in  case  of  Fig.  2,    is  due  to  the  absence  of  inhibitory  neurons  at  time  t  =  0.  These 
predicted values of 8 and 12.75 for M, when E0 = 1, are comparatively higher than the values ( 
M = 2 to 4 ) as suggested by de Gennes theoretically. I now briefly discuss the reason for this 
difference.  
 
Now, following de Gennes [1], when E = 1.8 and I = 1.44, Eq. (9) suggests x- = x+ = 0.72 and 
substitution of exponential solution given by Eq. (4) into Eq. (15) along with u = 1 and E0 = 1 
yields theoretical value for M  as

In Fig. 3, theoretical Eq. (4) and numerical solutions for ek vs. k are shown. From this figure, it 
is clear that exact numerical solutions of Eqs. (1) and (2), indicated by N1 and N2 in Fig. 3, 

differ  from  the  assumed  exponential  solution.  There  is  an  initial  increase  in  ek  for  the  exact 
numerical solutions and which is not captured by the assumed exponential solution, though the 
exponential solution fixes properly the upper limit for I . This initial increase in the number of 
excitatory  neurons  contributes  additionally  and  increases  the  value  of  M  to  8  or  12.75, 
depending on the presence and absence of inhibitory neurons at time t = 0.  
 
In conclusion, the minimum size of memory object for an odor in olfaction storage system is 8 
or 12.75 neurons depending on the initial presence and absence of 20% of inhibitory neurons 
when the amplification factor E = 1.8.

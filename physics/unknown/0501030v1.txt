Abstract 

The  BPM  system  in  Booster  only  can  provide  the  beam  position  from  the  average  of 

about 15 bunches due to the electronic limitation.  Numerically calculating the difference 

made  by  this  average  can  nearly  give  all  the  information,  which  is  needed  for 

extrapolating the BPM data.  It is still useful to derive the analytical expression for the 

BPM  reading,  which  can  be  helpful  in  getting  the  insight  for  the  BPM  system 

optimization. 

Introduction 

The  simulation  for  comparing  the  difference  between  BPM  reading  one  bunch  and  the 

average of multi-bunches has already been done,[1] except for the detail derivation of the 

analytical solution for BPM reading the multi-bunch average.  It is worth the effort to go 

through all the algebra in order to get an analytical solution.   Afterwards,  one can gain 

some  insights  from  the  analytical  solution,  and  also  have  a  better  understanding  of  the 

BPM data for the purpose of diagnostics and experimental parameter optimization.

Derivation 
A  BPM  reading  at  the  mth  turn  (x)  can  be  written  as  the  summation  of  three  different 

terms, as shown in eq.1.[2]

xco  represents  the  close  orbit,  xD  represents  the  displacement  due  to  the  none-zero 

dispersion (D), and xβ is the displacement due to the betatron motion.   

In the situation that the BPM reads one bunch, xD is

Qs is the synchrotron tune, and φ0 is the phase of the synchrotron motion at the BPM right 

after the excitation, which can be set to zero since the phase advance of the synchrotron 

motion is small within one Booster turn.  δ is

                                                                                                                          (3)

xˆ  is the amplitude of the betatron motion at the BPM, Qx is the betatron tune, and ξx is 

the chromaticity.  

'φ
0

 is the phase of the betatron motion at the BPM on the 0

th turn; it 

depends upon the phase advance between the place where the betatron motion is excited 

and the BPM position.  Here, we set it to zero. 

In the situation that the BPM reads the average of N bunches, xco is the same as before, xD 

and xβ become the average of N adjacent bunches.  Here, N is an integer, and it is about 
15 for Booster.  The betatron phase difference between the nth bunch and the 1st bunch is

synchrotron phase covered by the bunch train (N=15) is not more than 4° (at injection),

Comment 

By  going  through  the  derivation  of  the  analytical  expression  for  the  BPM  reading  of 

multi-bunch average, the direct influence from the number of bunches to be averaged, as 

shown in eq.7 is much more clear than that from the numerical calculation.

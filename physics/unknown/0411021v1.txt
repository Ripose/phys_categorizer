Abstract: The force on a microparticle in a complex plasma by streaming ions, the 
so-called ion drag force, is not well known. However, it is important for the 
understanding of interesting phenomena in complex plasmas such as the void 
formation under microgravity conditions. The PK-4 experiment, which is developed  
for a later use on board of the International Space Station, is ideally suited for 
investigating this problem. In this experiment a complex DC-plasma is created in a 
glass tube in which the microparticles flow from the cathode to the anode. Measuring 
the microparticle velocities, the forces on the particles for different particle sizes, 
pressures, and DC-currents can be extracted by assuming force balance. Experiments 
have been performed in the laboratory as well as under microgravity using parabolic 
flights. The results of these experiments will be presented and compared to 
theoretical predictions. 
 
 
Complex or dusty plasmas are low-temperature plasmas containing highly charged 
micron size particles. Mostly rf plasma chambers have been used to study the 
properties of complex plasmas, in particular regular structures in the microparticle 
component, the so-called plasma crystal [1]. Beside laboratory experiments, 
investigations under microgravity conditions are performed to avoid the disturbing 
effects of gravity on the microparticles [2]. Also a few experiments in a dc plasma 
chamber were conducted in the laboratory as well as under zero gravity [3]. For this 
purpose elongated glass cylinders with dc electrodes at their ends have been used. In 
addition external rf coils or electrodes can be applied to study the system in a 
combined dc/rf plasma.

PK-4 (``Plasmakristall-4'') is an experimental project for investigating complex dc 
and combined dc/rf plasmas under microgravity conditions on board of the 
International Space Station ISS after 2007 [4]. At the moment a laboratory 
experiment set-up is developed and first experiments are performed in the laboratory 
and in parabolic flight campaigns in a German-Russian collaboration. The PK-4 set-
up is especially suited to study the streaming of microparticles in the liquid phase of 
the complex plasma along the glass tube (Fig. 1). Measurements of the particle 
velocities for different pressures, dc currents, and particle sizes together with probe 
measurements of the plasma parameters allow the determination of the various forces 
acting on the particles. The electric charge of the particles has also been extracted in 
this way, showing that the standard OML theory [5] overestimates the charge up to a 
factor of 5 [6]. Also dust wave instabilities have been observed below a pressure 
threshold allowing an independent determination of the particle charge [6]. 
Furthermore, cloud collisions, soliton-like waves, and Lavalle nozzle simulations 
have been studied.  
   
The aim of the present work is to determine the ion drag force acting on the 
microparticles by the interaction between the particle and the ion components 
streaming against each other. This force is the least understood force acting on the 
particles. Its knowledge is of great importance for interesting phenomena in complex 
plasmas such as void formation under microgravity conditions [7]. At the moment 
there is a controversy about the ion drag force: the model by Barnes et al. [8] 
assumes that “... no ion interaction with the particles occurs outside of a Debye 
length” according to the standard Coulomb scattering theory. However, in complex 
plasmas the range of the ion-microparticle interaction is usually larger than the 
Debye screening length. Hence standard Coluomb scattering theory is not applicable.

As shown by Khrapak et al. [9] this fact can lead to a strong enhancement of the ion 
drag force compared to the model by Barnes. Investigating the trajectories of 
particles falling through a rf discharge plasma, Zafiu et al. [10,11] concluded that the 
ion drag force is given by Barnes’ formula if the electron Debye length is used there. 
However, in a bulk plasma with a subthermal ion drift velocity the Debye length is 
usually given by the ion Debye length leading to a significantly smaller ion drag 
force using Barnes’ formula [12]. 
 
In the PK-4 plasma chambers (see Fig. 2) filled with neon at the Max-Planck-
Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) and the Institute for High Energy 
Densities (IHED) the velocities of particles with different sizes (diameter from 1.28 
to 11 µm) have been measured by following the tracks of the particles, illuminated 
by a laser, on a film. The ion drag force Fi follows from the force balance equation 
 
Fi = FE - Fn + Fg                                                                                          (1)                                  
 
(or Fi = FE + Fn - Fg if the vertical tube configuration is used, the cathode is on top, 
and Fg > FE.) This equation assumes that the particles have reached their final 
velocity due to friction on the neutral gas in the field of view of the camera. This is 
true since the final velocity of the particles is achieved already within a fraction of a 

second  (even for the largest particles and smallest pressures used) whereas the 
particles enter the field of view a few seconds after their injection. 
 
The first force on the right hand side, FE = Q E, is the electric force on a particle with 
charge Q caused by the longitudinal electric dc field E (about 2 V/cm), which has 
been measured at IHED using a Langmuir probe. The particle charge Q was taken 
from a molecular dynamics calculations by Zobnin et al. [14], which give results in 
good agreement with PK-4 measurements [6]. To avoid a reduction of the charge by 
high particle densities (Havnes effect) we worked with the lowest dispenser settings 
to obtain particle densities as small as possible. 
 
The second force, Fn = γ vp, is the neutral drag friction with the Epstein coefficient 
γ and the measured particle velocity vp. The Epstein coefficient is proportional to a 
coefficient δ ranging from 1 for elastic scattering to 1.4 for diffuse reflection with 
full accommodation of the neutral gas atoms on the particles. However, falling 
particle experiments in the PK-4 chamber in neon gas without plasma indicated that 
the Epstein coefficient should be larger (δ = 1.6), which was also found by Liu et al. 
[13]. This can be explained possibly by a smaller size (reduction of the diameter by 
about 10%) of the melamine formaldehyde particles than given by the manufacturer. 
Indeed a microscopic inspection of the particles by Liu et al. [13] and at IHED 
showed such a reduction, which should be considered also for other forces and for 
other high precision experiments.   
 
The gravitational force Fg  is negligible in the parabolic flight experiments, where 
particles with nominal diameter of 6.86 µm were used, and in the laboratory if the 
tube is in the horizontal configuration. However, in the latter case only small 
particles with diameter from 1.28 to 3.42 µm can be injected into the tube in a way 
that their flow through the tube can be observed. For larger particles the weak 
ambipolar radial electric field is not sufficient to compensate gravity and the particles 
are lost to the tube walls. Therefore it is necessary to use a vertical configuration, 
where gravity is opposite to the electric force, i.e., the cathode is on top. The 
negatively charged particles stream downwards as gravity is always dominating for 
large particle sizes. However, due to the complete domination of the gravitational 
force it is difficult to determine weak forces such as the ion drag force, showing the 
importance of microgravity experiments. Here we will concentrate only on 
laboratory experiments with smaller particles in the horizontal tube configuration and 
parabolic flight experiments for large particles. 
 

The microparticles were illuminated by a laser and recorded on a film with 120 
frames per second by a CCD camera.  In Table 1 the velocities of the microparticles, 
measured from their track lengths on single images of the film (exposure time 8ms) 
or from the particle positions in subsequent images, are shown. About 20 tracks for 
each parameter set were examined, leading to the statistical errors given in Table 1. 
In the case of the largest particles (diameter 6.86 µm) used in parabolic flights a 
larger velocity variation was observed. All these measurements were performed at a 
current of 1 mA.

In Table 3 the ion drag force, derived from (1) with Fg = 0, is shown. We assumed 
the particle size as given by the manufacturer and used an accommodation coefficient 
δ = 1.6 as found in the falling particle experiments. We do not give any error in the 
ion drag force because the main uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the 
theoretical predicted charge and the measured electric field which are difficult to 
estimate.

Here the ion density ni is assumed to be equal to the electron density measured by the

ion temperature Ti = 300 K. The ion drift velocity according to Raizer [15] is 
approximately u[m/s] = 3900 E[V/cm]/p[Pa], the Coulomb radius is defined by 
ρ0 = Ze2/kTi with the particle charge Z, and Λ is the modified Coulomb logarithm

with particle radius a and ion Debye length λD [µm] = 120/(ni[108 cm-3])1/2. The ion 
Debeye length ranges from 74 µm at 60 Pa to 95 µm at 20 Pa. In (2) only the orbital 
part of the ion drag force due to Coulomb scattering is considered as the collection 
part is negligible for our choice of parameters. The ratio of the Coulomb radius to the 
ion Debye length in our experiment is between 1.4 for the 1.28 µm particles up to 
10.2 for the 6.86 µm particles, indicating that the standard Coulomb scattering theory 
is not valid [9].

For Fi(2) the ion Debye length λDi was used in (5), whereas for Fi(3) the electron 
Debye length λDe = (Te /Ti )1/2 λDi. The electron temperature Te, following from 
Langmuir probe measurements, is between 7.2 eV at 60 Pa and 7.7 eV at 20 Pa, 
leading to an electron Debye length between 1.3 mm and 1.7 mm. Using the electron 
Debye length instead of the ion Debye length leads to an enhancement of the ion 
drag force given by Barnes’ formula of about a factor of 5 for the small particles up 
to a factor of 50 for the large ones.

From these comparisons we arrive at the following conclusions: 
 
(1) The best agreement between the ion drag measurements with PK-4 and theory is 
given by Khrapak’s formula (2). This holds in particular at lower pressures, which is 
not surprising as ion collisions in the plasma are neglected in Khrapak’s formula and 
ion-neutral collisions become important at higher pressures. The mean free path of 
the ions is comparable to the Debye length at pressures above 40 Pa. 
 
(2) Barnes’ formula (4) is excluded by the experiment. Using the ion Debye length, 
Barnes’ formula underestimates the data clearly, while using the electron Debye 
length it overestimates the experiment significantly. The latter approach, however, is 
not justified anyway because the experiments took place in the bulk plasma with a 

subthermal drift velocity (u = 130 – 390 m/s, vTi = 351 m/s). Hence the Debye length 
is given by the ion Debye length [12]. 
 
(3) The size dependence of the ion drag force is in good agreement with theory. The 
experimental ion drag force decreases slower with increasing pressure than predicted, 
indicating the importance of ion-neutral collisions which lead to an enhancement of 
the ion drag force at higher pressures [16].

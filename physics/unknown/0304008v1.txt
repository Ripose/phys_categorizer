With  using  of  point-dipole  model  the  theoretical  calculations  of  main 

refractive indices and orientation of indicatrix of 18 minerals are performed. 

The feature of studied minerals is the statistically disordered arrangement of 

CO3, SO4, SO2, PO4 groups and also separate ions. The optical characters of 

uniaxial  minerals  and  orientation  of  indicatrix  of  orthorhombic  and 

monoclinic  minerals,  obtained  by  results  of  calculations,  agree  with 

experimental definitions. 

 

The  point-dipole  model  is  enough  widely  used  in  investigations,  which  devoted  to 

theoretical calculations of parameters of optical indicatrix of crystals and also to definition of 

polarizabilities of atoms [1-9]. For further development of this field the propagation of point-

dipole model on a case of statistically disordered arrangement of atoms and atomic groups is 

obviously important. This was the purpose of the present work.  

 

In terms of the point-dipole model, atoms in a crystal are considered as dipoles, whose 

dimensions  are  negligibly  small  in  comparison  with  the  interatomic  distances.  In  this 

approximation, the local electric field induced by a light wave in the position k of the unit cell 

has the form [10]: 

              F(k)=E+4π Σ L(kk’)P(k’)/v,                                                                 (1) 
                                  k’ 
where E – is the macroscopic field, P (k ’) – is the dipole moment in the position k ’, v – is the 

unit cell volume, L (kk ’) – is the Lorentz-factor tensor, which depends on the geometry of the 

structure.  

same position by the equation: 

 

The  dipole  moment  in  the  k’  position  is  related  to  the  local  electric  field  F(k’)  in  the 

                    P(k’)=α(k’)F(k’),                                                                           (2) 
where α(k’) - polarizability. The general electrical dipole moment of the unit cell has the form: 

                    P=∑α(k)F(k).                                                                                 (3) 
                          k

Substituting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we obtain the system of linear equations with respect to 

the components of the F vector. Solving this system and substituting obtained F vectors into Eq. 

(3)  we  obtain  the  tensor  relating  the  total  dipole  moment  of  the  unit  cell  to  the  vector  of 

macroscopic field. Dividing the components of this tensor into the unit cell volume, one obtains 

the dielectric susceptibility tensor and can pass to the dielectric constant tensor. 

 In  the  case  of  presence  in  crystal  structure  of  atomic  groups  arranged  statistically,  the 

calculation  of  the  dielectric  constant  tensor  becomes  more  complicated.  In  the  first  place, 

because  the  polarizabilities  of  atoms  of  such  groups  in  Eq.  (3)  must  be  multiplied  on  the 

corresponding occupancies. The same must be made in Eq. (2), except for a case, when the atom 

in  position  k’  belongs  to  the  same  atomic  group,  as  atom  in  position  k  at  k  ≠  k’.  Secondly, 

because  the  occupation  by  a  group  of  one  of  its  possible  positions  means  absence  of  another 

groups,  whose  atoms  would  be  placed  on  forbidden  distances  from  atoms  of  the  given  group. 

Due to this fact from the local fields (1) in positions k, in which atoms relating to atomic groups 

are  placed  it is  necessary  to subtract fields, equal to values of  fields of dipoles in the not held 

positions k’, in which atoms of another groups would be placed: 

                            3(P(k’)R(kk’))     R(kk’)             P(k’) 
      F’(kk’) =                   ,                              (4) 
                                  r(kk’) 4            r(kk’)              r(kk’) 3 
 
where R (kk ’) - vector with the beginning in a position k’ and end in a position k, r(kk’) - length 

of vector R(kk’). 

  

 With the help of the described approach we executed theoretical calculations of optical 

properties of a series of minerals (tab.1), for which disordering of CO3, SO4, SO2, PO4 groups, 

and also separate ions is characteristic. In the letter case the same approach, as for atomic groups, 

is applicable, because separate atoms are particular cases of atomic groups.  

In  tab.2  for  all  of  studied  minerals  the  types  of  a  statistically  disordered  groups  and 

atoms, and also Dmax - maximum of forbidden distances between positions of atoms are shown. 

Except cancrinite(I), in all of studied minerals there are forbidden distances between positions in 

a cell, in which atoms of the mentioned above groups are placed.  

To perform the calculations, we wrote a program entitled AnRef3. The input data are the 

parameters of an elementary parallelepiped, the fractional coordinates of all the atoms in the unit 

cell, and their polarizabilities. The Lorentz-factor tensor is calculated by the method described in 

[10].  If  the  calculated  dielectric-constant  tensor  is  not  diagonal,  the  program  reduces  it  to  the 

principal  axes;  then,  the  principal  refractive  indices  equal  to  square  roots  of  the  diagonal 

components are calculated.

The  polarizabilities  of  ions  depend  on  many  factors,  e.g.,  on  the  bond  polarity.  As  a 

consequence, they are essentially different in different compounds but remain close to the ionic 

refractions of the corresponding chemical elements [28, 29], which were used in our calculations 

as ionic polarizabilities.  

The results of calculations of optical properties of uniaxial minerals are shown in tab. 3, 

orthorhombic mineral rhomboclase, and also monoclinic amphiboles - in tab. 4. Shown in these 

tables  the  experimental  values  for  line  D  (λ  =  589mµ)  were  taken  from  following  works:  for 

uniaxial minerals from [30], for rhomboclase from [31], for amphiboles from [32].  

Pay  on  itself  attention  some  deviations  of  the  calculated  main  refractive  indices  from 

experimentally defined. This is caused by differences of refractions, used in calculations, from 

true  polarizabilities  of  ions  in  crystals.  Especially  strong  differences  of  the  calculated  and 

measured refractive indices for plumbogummite and hinsdalite are explained, apparently, by high 
ionic refraction of cation Pb2+. Even the minor deviation of nature of bond of the given cation 

from an only ionic type results in an essential decrease of a general polarizability. 

More  interesting  for  us,  however,  were  theoretical  calculations  not  of  main  refractive 

indices,  but  parameters  describing  an  anisotropy  of  optical  properties,  since  these  parameters 

depend  mainly  on  geometry  of  structure,  which  can  be  defined  relatively  precisely.  The 

polarizabilities  of  ions  essentially  vary  in  different  compounds  [28,  29],  however  their 

influencing on an anisotropy of optical properties can be not considerable. That was shown as a 

result of calculations of orientation of indicatrix in monoclinic and triclinic minerals [6-8].  

On  a  lot  of  parameters  describing  an  anisotropy  of  optical  properties,  the  conformity 

between  outcomes  of  calculations  and  experimental  definitions  is  revealed.  For  all  uniaxial 

minerals  the  optical  character,  obtained  as  a  result  of  calculations,  has  coincided  with 

experimentally  defined.  For  orthorhombic  mineral  rhomboclase  as  a  result  of  calculations  the 

true orientation of an indicatrix relatively to the crystallographic axes was obtained. 

Studied by us monocline amphiboles are characterized by the similar structural motives 

and close parameters of a unit cell. These minerals also have the similar one another orientation 

of  indicatrix.  The  axis  Nm  in  crystals  of  all  minerals  coincides  with  two-fold  axis.  This  fact 

agrees with the results of calculations. Lying in a plane of symmetry m the axis of indicatrix Ng 

is turned down from a positive direction of axis a to the positive direction of axis c on angles 71-

105°. The similar calculated angles are somewhat more - 115-132°. As a result of calculations 

the  directions  of  axis  Ng  deflected  from  experimental  directions  on  rather  large  angles  were 

obtained. For kaersutite and hastingsite these angles are much less then 45°. This means that the 

calculated  direction  Ng  is  closer  to  a  true  direction  Ng,  than  to  a  true  direction  Np.  For  both 

types of pargasite the given angle is close to 45°. For edenite difficultly to determine difference

between  calculated  and  true  directions  Ng  because  of  absence  of  precise  experimental  data;  it 

lays within the limits from 40 up to 61°.  

The disagreements between the calculated and true parameters are caused by limitation of 

applicability  of  point-dipole  model  for  explanation  of  optical  properties  of  crystals  [4].  To  the 

main causes of this limitation it is necessary to relate, at first, that in calculations the isotropic 

polarizabilities of ions were used, secondly, that the dipoles were considered as placed in centers 

of ions. External electronic orbitals, which strongly influence on a polarizability of ion, can have 

center  which  is  not  coincides  with  center  of  ion,  which  was  determined  as  a  result  of  X-ray 

diffraction study.

Abstract 

the 

irregular 

fluctuations 

Dynamical  systems  in  nature  such  as  fluid  flows,  heart  beat  patterns, 
rainfall  variability,  stock  market  price  fluctuations,  etc.  exhibit  selfsimilar 
fractal  fluctuations  characterized  by  a  zigzag  (an  increase  followed  by  a 
decrease  and  vice-versa)  curve  on  all  scales  in  space  and  time.  Power 
spectral  analyses  of  fractal  fluctuations  exhibit  inverse  power  law  form 
indicating  long-range  space-time  correlations,  identified  as  self-organized 
criticality. Mathematical models for simulation and prediction of dynamical 
systems are nonlinear so that analytical solutions are not available. Finite 
initial 
precision  computed  solutions  are  sensitively  dependent  on 
conditions  and  give  chaotic  solutions,  identified  as  deterministic  chaos. 
The  author  has  proposed  a  general  systems  theory,  which  predicts  the 
observed  fractal  fluctuations  as  signatures  of  quantumlike  chaos.  The 
the 
model  visualizes 
superimposition of a continuum of eddies where the dominant component 
eddies can be resolved using spectral analyses. The model shows that (1) 
the  fractal  fluctuations  result  from  an  overall  logarithmic  spiral  trajectory 
with  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  for  the  internal  structure. 
Conventional power spectral analysis of such a logarithmic spiral trajectory 
will  show  a  continuum  of  eddies  with  progressive  increase  in  phase.  (2) 
Power  spectral  analyses  of  fractal  fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems 
exhibit  the  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the  statistical  normal 
distribution. Such a result indicates that the additive amplitudes of eddies, 
when  squared  (namely  the  variance)  represent  the  probabilities,  a 
characteristic  exhibited  by  the  subatomic  dynamics  of  quantum  systems 
such  as 
long-range  space-time 
correlations or non-local connections such as that exhibited by macroscale 
dynamical  systems  characterize  quantum  systems  also.  Therefore 
selfsimilar fractal fluctuations generic to dynamical systems of all scales in 
nature  is  a  signature  of  quantumlike  chaos.  The  model  concepts  are 
applied  to  show  that  the  frequency  distribution  of  bases  A,  C,  G,  T  in 
Human Chromosome Y DNA exhibit long-range spatial correlations.

Introduction 

factor  alone 

independent  of 

Dynamical  systems  such  as  rainfall,  heart  rhythms,  aggregate 
market  economics,  the  electrical  activity  of  the  brain,  etc.,  exhibit 
selfsimilar fractal space-time fluctuations. Such irregular fluctuations 
may be visualized to result from the superimposition of an ensemble 
of  eddies  or  sine  waves.  The  power  spectra  of  fractal  fluctuations 
exhibit inverse power law form fa where f is the frequency and a the 
exponent signifying long-range space-time correlations identified as 
self-organized  criticality  (Bak,  Tang  and  Wiesenfeld,  1988).  Such 
non-local  connections  indicate  that  for  the  range  of  space-time 
scales  for  which  the  slope  a  of  the  spectrum  is  a  constant,  the 
amplitudes of the component eddies are related to each other by a 
scale 
the  physical,  chemical, 
physiological processes underlying the observed fractal fluctuations 
of  the  dynamical  system.  The  exact  physical  mechanism  for  the 
observed  self-organized  criticality  is  not  yet  identified.  The  author 
has  developed  a  general  systems  theory  for  turbulent  fluid  flows, 
which  shows  that  the  observed  fractal  space-time  fluctuations  of 
dynamical systems are signatures of quantumlike chaos. The theory 
provides unique quantification for self-organized criticality in terms of 
the  statistical  normal  distribution  (Selvam,  1990;  Selvam  and 
Fadnavis, 1998). The model concepts are applicable to all dynamical 
systems and in this paper it is shown that the frequency distribution 
of  bases  (nucleotides)  A,  C,  G,  T  in  Human  Chromosome  Y  DNA 
exhibit  long-range  spatial  correlations.  The  results  of  the  study 
indicate  that  the  DNA  molecule  functions  as  a  unified  whole  self-
organized  network  comprised  of  the  cooperative  existence  of  both 
the  coding  exons.  Recent 
noncoding 
investigations  (Kettlewell,  2004;  Pearson,  2004)  have  shown 
conclusive  proof  that  the  noncoding  introns,  also  called  ‘junk  DNA’ 
plays  a  non-trivial  role  in  the  effective  functioning  of  the  coding 
exons.

2. Model concepts 

In summary (Selvam, 1990; Selvam and Fadnavis, 1998), the model 
is based on Townsend’s concept (Townsend, 1956) that large eddy 
structures form in turbulent flows as envelopes of enclosed turbulent 
eddies.  Such  a  simple  concept  that  space-time  averaging  of  small-
scale  structures  gives  rise  to  large-scale  space-time  fluctuations 
leads to the following important model predictions. 

2.1 Quantumlike chaos in turbulent fluid flows 

Since  the  large  eddy  is  but  the  integrated  mean  of  enclosed 
turbulent  eddies,  the  eddy  energy  (kinetic)  distribution  follows 

 

3

statistical normal distribution according to the Central Limit Theorem 
(Ruhla, 1992). Such a result that the additive amplitudes of eddies, 
when  squared,  represent  probability  distributions  is  found  in  the 
subatomic  dynamics  of  quantum  systems  such  as  the  electron  or 
photon. Atmospheric flows, or, in general turbulent fluid flows follow 
quantumlike chaos. 

2.2 Dynamic memory (information) circulation network 

The root mean square (r.m.s.) circulation speeds W and w* of large 
and turbulent eddies of respective radii R and r are related as

the 

Eq.(1)  is  a  statement of  the  law  of  conservation  of energy  for  eddy 
growth  in  fluid  flows  and  implies  a  two-way  ordered  energy  flow 
between 
larger  and  smaller  scales.  Microscopic  scale 
perturbations  are  carried  permanently  as  internal  circulations  of 
progressively  larger  eddies.  Fluid  flows  therefore  act  as  dynamic 
memory  circulation  networks  with  intrinsic  long-term  memory  of 
short-term fluctuations.  

2.3 Quasicrystalline structure 

The flow structure consists of an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory 
with  Fibonacci  winding  number  and  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern  for  internal  structure  (Fig.1).  Primary  perturbation  ORO 
(Fig.1)  of  time  period  T  generates 
return  circulation  OR1RO  which,  in 
turn,  generates  successively  larger 
circulations  OR1R2,  OR2R3,  OR3R4, 
the 
OR4R5, 
successive  radii  form  the  Fibonacci 
mathematical  number  series, 
i.e., 
OR1/ORO=  OR2/OR1  =  …….=  t 
where t is the golden mean equal to 
(1+(cid:1)5)/2(cid:2)1.618.  The  flow  structure 
therefore  consists  of  a  nested 
continuum  of  vortices,  i.e.,  vortices 
within vortices.

The dominant quasi-periodicities are equal to 2.2T, 3.6T, 5.8T, 9.5T, 
……for  values  of  n  =  -1,  0,  1,  2,  respectively  (Eq.2).  Space-time 
integration  of  turbulent  fluctuations  results  in  robust  broadband 
dominant  periodicities  (wavelengths),  which  are  functions  of  the 
primary  perturbation  time  period  T  alone  and  are  independent  of 
exact  details  (chemical,  electrical,  physical  etc.)  of 
turbulent 
fluctuations.  Also,  such  global  scale  oscillations  in  the  unified 
localized 
network  are  not  affected  appreciably  by 
microscale circulation networks. 

failure  of 

Wavelengths  (or  periodicities)  close  to  the  model  predicted 
values  have  been  reported  in  weather  and  climate  variability 
(Selvam  and  Fadnavis,  1998),  prime  number  distribution  (Selvam, 
2001a),  Riemann  zeta  zeros  (non-trivial)  distribution  (Selvam, 
2001b),  Drosophila  DNA  base  sequence  (Selvam,  2002),  stock 
market  economics  (Selvam,  2003),  Human  chromosome  1  DNA 
base sequence (Selvam, 2004). 

Similar  unified  communication  networks  may  be  involved  in 
biological  and  physiological  systems  such  as  the  brain  and  heart, 
which  continue  to  perform  overall  functions  satisfactorily  in  spite  of 
localized

and minor mutations (Kitano, 2002).

2.5 Universal spectrum of fluctuations 

Conventional power spectral analysis will resolve such a logarithmic 
spiral flow trajectory as a continuum of eddies (broadband spectrum) 
with a progressive increase in phase angle. 

The  power  spectrum,  plotted  on  log-log  scale  as  variance 
versus  frequency  (period)  will  represent  the  probability  density 
to 
corresponding 
to  normalized  standard  deviation 
(logL/logT50) –1 where L is the period in years and T50 is the period 
up to which the cumulative percentage contribution to total variance 
is  equal  to  50.  The  above  expression  for  normalized  standard 
deviation  t  follows  from  model  prediction  of  logarithmic  spiral  flow 
structure  and  model  concept  of  successive  growth  structures  by 
space-time  averaging.  Fluctuations  of  all  scales  therefore  self-
organize  to  form  the  universal  inverse  power  law  form  of  the 
statistical normal distribution.

3. Applications of the general systems theory concepts to 
genomic DNA base sequence structure 

DNA  sequences,  the  blueprint  of  all  essential  genetic  information, 
are polymers consisting of two complementary strands of four types 
of  bases:  adenine  (A),  cytosine  (C),  guanine  (G)  and  thymine  (T). 
Among  the  four  bases,  the  presence  of  A  on  one  strand  is  always 
paired  with  T  on  the  opposite  strand,  forming  a  “base  pair”  with  2 
hydrogen  bonds.  Similarly,  G  and  C  are  complementary  to  one 
another,  while  forming  a  base  pair  with  3  hydrogen  bonds.  In 
addition,  the  frequency  of  A(G)  on  a  single  strand  is  approximately 
equal to the frequency of T(C) on the same strand, a phenomenon 
that  has  been  termed  “strand  symmetry”  or  “Chargaff’s  second 
parity”. The full story of how DNA really functions is not merely what 
is written on the sequence of base-pairs; The DNA functions involve 
information  transmission  over  many  length  scales  ranging  from  a 
few to several hundred nanometers (Ball, 2003). 

One of the major goals in DNA sequence analysis is to gain 
an  understanding  of  the  overall  organization  of  the  genome,  in 
particular,  to  analyze  the  properties  of  the  DNA  string  itself.  Long-
range correlations in DNA base sequence structure, which give rise 
to  1/f  spectra  have  been  identified  (Azad  et  al.,  2002).  Such  long-
range  correlations  in  space-time  fluctuations  is  very  common  in 
nature  and  Li  (2004)  has  given  an  extensive  and  informative 
bibliography  of  the  observed  1/f  noise  or 1/f  spectra,  where  f  is  the 
frequency,  in  biological,  physical,  chemical  and  other  dynamical 
systems.  

The  long-range  correlations  in  nucleotide  sequence  could  in 
principle  be  explained  by  the  coexistence  of  many  different  length 
scales.  The  advantage  of  spectral  analysis  is  to  reveal  patterns 
hidden in a direct correlation function. The shape of the 1/f spectra 
differs  greatly  among  sequences.  Different  DNA  sequences  do  not 
exhibit  the  same  power  spectrum.  The  final  goal  is  to  eventually 
learn  the  ‘genome  organization  principles’  (Li,  1997).  The  coding 
sequences of most vertebrate genes are split into segments (exons) 
which are separated by noncoding intervening sequences (introns). 
A  very  small  minority  of  human  genes  lack  noncoding  introns  and 
are very small genes (Strachan and Read, 1996). 

In  the  following  it  is  shown  that  the  frequency  distribution  of 
Human  chromosome  Y  DNA  bases  A,  C,  G,  T  concentration  per 
10bp  (non-overlapping)  follows  the  model  prediction  (Section  2)  of 
self-organized  criticality  or  quantumlike  chaos  implying  long-range 
spatial  correlations  in  the  distribution  of  the  bases  along  the  DNA 
base sequence.

4.2 Power spectral analyses: variance and phase spectra 

The number of times bases A, C, G, T occur in successive blocks of 
10  bases  were  determined  in  successive  length  sections  of  70000 
base  pairs  giving  frequency  distribution  series  of  7000  values  for 
each data set. A total number of 345 data sets each of length 7000 
values  for  each  of  the  four bases A,  C, G, T  were  available for  the 
study. The power spectra of frequency distribution of the four bases 
in  the  data  sets  were  computed  accurately  by  an  elementary,  but 
very  powerful  method  of  analysis  developed  by  Jenkinson  (1977) 
which provides a quasi-continuous form of the classical periodogram 
allowing  systematic  allocation  of  the  total  variance  and  degrees  of 
freedom of the data series to logarithmically spaced elements of the 
frequency range (0.5, 0). The cumulative percentage contribution to

total variance was computed starting from the high frequency side of 
the  spectrum.  The  power  spectra  were  plotted  as  cumulative 
percentage  contribution  to  total  variance  versus  the  normalized 
standard  deviation  t.  The  statistical  chi-square  test  (Spiegel,  1961) 
was  applied  to  determine  the  ‘goodness  of  fit’  of  variance  spectra 
with  statistical  normal  distribution.  Results  of  power  spectral 
analyses  (averages)  are  given  in  Table  2.  The  average  variance 
spectra for the ten contiguous data sets (Table 1) are given in Figure 
2.

5. Conclusions 

The  important  conclusions  of  this  study  are  as  follows:  (1)  the 
frequency distribution of bases A, C, G,T per 10bp in chromosome Y 
DNA exhibit selfsimilar fractal fluctuations which follow the universal 
inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution (Fig.2), a 
signature  of  quantumlike  chaos.  (2)  Quantumlike  chaos  indicates 
long-range  spatial  correlations  or  ‘memory’  inherent  to  the  self-
organized  fuzzy  logic  network  of  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern  (Fig.1).  (3)  Such  non-local  connections  indicate  that  coding 
exons  together  with  non-coding  introns  contribute  to  the  effective 
functioning of the DNA molecule as a unified whole. Recent studies 
indicate  that mutations  in  introns  introduce  adverse  genetic  defects 
(Cohen,  2002).  (4)  The  space  filling  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling 
pattern provides maximum packing efficiency for the DNA molecule 
inside the chromosome.

The  general  systems  theory  described  in  this  paper  is 
applicable 
including  sociology  and 
behavioural  sciences.  Cor  van  Dijkum  (2001)  has  stated  that 
mathematical  theory  of  complexity  can  be  used  in  the  social 
sciences to understand complex social phenomena.

satisfy all requirements on ideal photon source for nuclear 
resonance fluorescence experiments   [6]. 

On the other hand, there are several standard (ring-ring 
type)  ep  collider  proposals  with  √sep  >  1  TeV.  The  first 
one  is  an  ep  option  for  LHC  [7].  This  proposal,  which 
assumes  a  construction  of  67.3  GeV  electron  ring  in  the 
LHC  tunnel,  is  considered  as  a  part  of  the  LHC 
programme  in  [8].  Concerning  the  VLHC  based  ep 
collider,  a  construction  of  180  GeV  e-ring  in  the  VLHC 
tunnel is proposed in [9]. Linac-ring type counterparts of 
these  proposals  were  considered  in  [10]  and  [11], 
respectively.  

The  2005  status  was  discussed  in  the  review  [12], 
where  different  TeV  scale  lepton-hadron  and  photon-
hadron  collider  proposals  (such  as THERA  [13],  “LEP”-
LHC [8, 9], QCD Explorer [1, 14] etc) are considered.  

 
 

Abstract 

TeV  center  of  mass  energy  lepton-hadron  collider  is 
necessary  both  to  clarify  fundamental  aspects  of  strong 
interactions  and  for  adequate  interpretation  of  the  LHC 
data. Recently proposed QCD Explorer utilizes the energy 
advantage  of  the  LHC  proton  and  ion  beams,  which 
allows the usage of relatively low energy electron beam. 
Two options for the LHC based ep collider are posibble: 
construction of a new electron ring in the LHC tunnel or 
construction of an e-linac tangentially to the LHC. In the 
latter case, which seems more acceptable for a number of 
reasons, two options are under consideration for electron 
linac:  the  CLIC  technology  allows  shorter  linac  length, 
whereas TESLA technology gives higher luminosity.

INTRODUCTION 
It  is  known  that  lepton-hadron  collisions  have  been 
playing  a  crucial  role  in  exploration  of  deep  inside  of 
the  quark-parton  model  was 
matter.  For  example, 
originated 
electron-nucleon 
investigation  of 
scattering. The HERA with √sep ≈ 0.3 TeV has opened a 
new  era  in  this  field  extending  the  kinematics  region  by 
two  orders  both  in  high  Q²  and  small  x  with  respect  to 
fixed 
the  region  of 
sufficiently  small  x  (≤  10-5)  and  simultaneously  high  Q² 
(≥ 10 GeV²), where saturation of parton densities should 
is  not  currently  achievable.  The

but

understanding  the  nature  of  strong  interactions  at  all 
levels  from  nucleus  to  partons.  At  the  same  time,  the 
results  from  lepton-hadron  colliders  are  necessary  for 
adequate  interpretation  of  physics  at  future  hadron 
colliders.

Today,  linac-ring  type  machines  seem  to  be  the  main 
way  to  TeV  scale  in  lepton-hadron  collisions  at  the 
constituent 
therein). 
Construction  of  future  linear  collider  or  a  special  e-linac 
tangentially  to  existing  (HERA,  TEVATRON,  SPS, 
RHIC)  or  planned  (LHC,  VLHC)  hadron  rings  will 
provide a number of new powerful tools in addition to ep 
and eA options: 

- TeV scale γp [2] and γA [3] colliders. In this case high 
energy electron beam will be converted into photon beam 
using Compton back scattering of laser photons on ultra-
relativistic  electrons  (see  [4]  and  references  therein).  It 
should  be  noted  that  photon-hadron  options  can  not  be 
realized on the base of standard (ring-ring) type electron-
hadron colliders. (see arguments given in [2]) 

-  FEL-Nucleus  colliders  [5].  In  this  case  (a  part  of)  e-
linac  will  be  used  for  production  of  keV  energy  laser 
beam.  Let  us  mentioned  that  FEL-Nucleus  colliders

Recently,  Large  Hadron  Electron  Collider  (LHeC)  is 
proposed, in which a 70 GeV electron (positron) beam in 
the  LHC  tunnel  is  in  collision  with  one  of  the  LHC 
hadron beams [15].  

In  this  paper  we  compare  two  options  for  the  LHC 
based  ep  collider:  construction  of  a  new  electron  ring  in 
the  LHC  tunnel  (LHeC)  and  construction  of  an  e-linac 
tangentially to the LHC (QCD Explorer).  

QCD EXPLORER: EP OPTION 
As  mentioned  above,  reconsidered  standard  (ring-ring 
type)  ep  option  for  LHC (LHeC)  assumes  a  construction 
of 70 GeV e-ring in the LHC tunnel. Main parameters of 
the LHeC lepton and proton beams are presented in Table 
1. Center of mass energy and expected luminosity are √sep 
= 1.4 TeV and Lep = 1033 cm-2s-1, respectively. However, 
construction  of  an  additional  e-ring  in  the  LHC  tunnel 
might  cause  a  lot  of  technical  problems:  an  example  is 
inevitable  removing  of  the  LEP  from  the  tunnel  in  order 
to assemble the LHC. In any case, LHC could not operate 
during  the  installation  of  e-ring.  For  these  reasons, 
alternative  linac-ring  type  ep  option  for  the  LHC  should 
be considered seriously.

Let us consider the use of e-linac instead of e-ring with 
~27  km  circumference.  The  most  transparent  expression 
(in practical units) for the luminosity of linac-ring type ep 
colliders is [16]:

where  Pe  denotes  electron  beam  power,  which  is  taken 
equal to radiation power of corresponding e-ring. With Ee 
= 70 GeV, Pe = 50 MW and LHC proton beam parameters 
from  the  Table  1  one  obtain  Lep  =  2.4·1031  cm-2s-1  for

parameters [13], namely, np = 1011, εp
10  cm,  the  luminosity  for  “ideal”  e-linac  becomes 
Lep=2.6·1032  cm-2s-1.  An  additional  factor  3-4  can  be 
provided using dynamical focusing [17]. Therefore, QCD 
Explorer could provide for ep option the same luminosity 
as LHeC, in principle.

Concerning the “real” e-linac technologies we consider 
TESLA  and  CLIC  proposals.  Parameters  of  the  TESLA 
(THERA  option  [13])  and  CLIC  [18]  e-beams  are  given 

in Table 2. It is seen that in the TESLA case one can use 
all e-bunches, whereas only ~3% of the CLIC e-bunches 
will  collide  with  the  LHC  proton  bunches.  (Let  us 
mentioned that superbunch option for the LHC could give 
opportunity  to  utilize  all  CLIC  bunches  [14]  but  this 
opportunity requires a radical modification of whole LHC 
stages  from  injector  to  main  ring).  With  nominal  LHC 
parameters  we  obtain  Lep=1.9·1030  cm-2s-1  for  “TESLA” 
and Lep=1.4·1028 cm-2s-1 for “CLIC” (for details see [19]). 
With THERA like modification of the LHC proton beam, 
the  luminosity  values  become  Lep=3.3·1031  cm-2s-1  and 
Lep=2.3·1029  cm-2s-1  respectively  (see  Table  3).  It  is  seen 
that  a  factor  of  ~3.5 for  TESLA  technology  and a  factor 
of  ~  500  for  CLIC  technology  are  needed  in  order  to 
achieve a luminosity Lep= 1032 cm-2s-1.

Because  of  7  times  higher  proton  beam  energy 
comparing  to  the  HERA  the  number  of  protons  in  LHC 
bunches  can  be  essentially  enlarged.  For  example,  the 
LHC beam lifetime is ~5 h for Np=5·1011 and εp
N=1 μm. 
Therefore,  luminosity  Lep=1032  cm-2s-1  can  be  achieved 
with TESLA technology.  

Radical  modification  of  electron  beam  is  necessary  in 
the  case  of  CLIC  technology.  For  example,  Ne  can  be 
enlarged  by  the  factor  of  2.5  [20]  (the  beam-beam  tune 
shift,  ΔQp,  permits  the  factor  ~6).  In  addition,  the 
effective collision frequency can be enlarged by factor 10 
due  to  corresponding  increase  of  the  number  of  bunch 
trains per RF pulse a la CLICHÉ [21]. Remaining factor 4 
may be provided by “dynamic focusing” [17]. 

To  summarize,  using  TESLA  and  CLIC  like  electron 
linacs  with  active  lengths  ~2.9  km  and  ~0.45  km, 
respectively,  one  can  obtain  the  same  center  of  mass 
energy as in the case of ~27 km electron ring. Concerning 
the luminosity, “moderate” upgrade of TESLA and LHC 
beams could give opportunity to achieve Lep=1032 cm-2s-1, 
whereas  “radical”  upgrades  of  e-beam  is  needed  for 
CLIC.  Obviously,  design  of  a  “dedicated”  linac  will 
essentially improve QCD-E parameters. 

 

ADDITIONAL eA, γp, γA OPTIONS 
Both QCD-E and LHeC can operate as eA collider with 
LeA·A≈  0.1·Lep,  where  A  is  the  atomic  number  of 
corresponding nucleus (Pb, Cr, O, D), whereas γp and γA 
options are unique for QCD-E. Parameters of the QCD-E 
based  γp  collider  are  considered  in  [22]  (for  energy 
frontiers  see  [23]).  Luminosity  of  γp  (γA)  collider 

depends on the distance z between conversion region and 
collision point and varies from ≈ 1 (at z = 0) to ≈ 0.1 (at z 
= 10 m) of the luminosity of basic ep (eA) collider.

CONCLUSION 
Lepton-hadron collider with √sep > 1 TeV is necessary 
both to clarify fundamental aspects of the QCD part of the 
Standard  Model  and  for  adequate  interpretation  of 
experimental  data  from  the  LHC.  Today,  there  are  two 
realistic  proposals,  namely,  QCD  Explorer  and  LHeC. 
Both QCD-E and LHeC will give opportunity to achieve 
sufficiently  high  luminosity  to  explore  crucial  aspects  of 
the  strong  interactions.  Whereas  LHeC  is  based  on  the 
more  familiar  approach  (we  have  nice  experience  from 
the HERA), QCD-E has a number of advantages: 
•  additional γp, γA and FEL γA options 
•  electron  beam  energy  can  be  expanded  by  increasing 
linac length, whereas synchrotron radiation blocks this 
road for LHeC 

The main goal of both QCD-E and LHeC proposals is 
to  clarify  fundamental  aspects  of  strong  interactions. 
Their potential for the BSM physics search is restricted by 
center of mass energy. Therefore, very high luminosity is 
not so important. In our opinion γA option of the QCD-E 
will  provide  crucial  information  on  QCD  dynamics  at 
small xg in nuclear medium

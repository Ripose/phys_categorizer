 An Open Letter to NASA Scientists Concerning
"The Apparent Anomalous, Weak, Long-Range
Acceleration of [the spacecraft] Pioneer 10 and 11" 

A  weak  long-range  acceleration  towards  the  Sun  has  been  observed  in  the  Pioneer  10  and  11
satellites for which no satisfactory explanation has been obtained in spite of diligent efforts by a number
of parties over an extended period of time. [1] , [2]

An analytical explanation that correlates precisely with the observed  data  [unlike  the  numerous
failed explanations so far offered] has been proposed [by direct personal e-mail, by procedurally correct
technical paper submissions, and by e-print publication] to the involved NASA scientists, to the principal
physics journals of the world, and to the physics community in general.[3]

That offered solution has been consistently rejected / neglected out-of-hand.  Not one scientist has
actually  logically  examined  the  hypothesis.    A  quite  simple  and  direct  pair  of  experiments  that  would
validate or invalidate the hypothesis have been proposed without the slightest responsive interest.[4]  Why
is that so ?

Quoting [2], which quotes Dr. N... of NASA "'Either gravity is different than we think it is or time
is  messed  up  somehow.'    Those  prospects  are  exactly  what  the  physics  community  is  resisting."    The
resemblance  of  the  "physics  community  ...  resisting"  to  the  Church  suppression  of  Galileo  is  not
coincidental.

Dr. N...'s comment about "gravity is different than we think it is" is also rather strange in that the
physics  community  still  has  not  the least idea of  how  and  why  gravity  operates  --  so  much  so  that  the
principal  authority  for  the  values  of  the  fundamental  constants,  CODATA[5],  is  unable  to  include  the
universal  gravitation  constant,  G,  in  the  least  squares  adjustment  of  the  other  fundamental  constants
because the physics community does not know how gravitation relates to the rest of physics.

How  long  can  rational,  truth-seeking  scientists  ignore  an  explanation  that  validly  resolves  the

"mystery" and opens up a vastness of opportunity for advance in physics understanding ?

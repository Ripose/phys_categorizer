In a 

Λ

-type system employing a two-photon probe field, a four-wave mixing field 

may  be  generated  simultaneously  and  hence  forms  a  closed  loop  system.  We  report  on 

the  theoretical  demonstration  of  phase  dependence  of  four-wave  mixing  (FWM)  and 

electromagnetically  induced  transparency  (EIT)  in  this  system.  We  show  that  the 

intensity of the FWM depends crucially on the relative phase 

θ  of the two excited fields. 

Different  from  the  ordinary 

Λ

-type  system  usually  closed  by  a  radio-frequency  field, 

however, the EIT is independent of the relative phase 

θ  at all time.

I. Introduction 

In the past few decades, a large number of theoretical and experimental studies on 

quantum  interference  have  been  made.  One  of  those  innovations  is  the  effect  of 

electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [1]. In the simple  Λ -type system, which 

interacts with two incident fields, the relative phase of the two fields will not influence its 

properties.  In  a  closed-loop 

Λ

-type  three  level  system,  however,  the  relative  phase  of 

excited  fields  not  only  influence  the  temporary  evolution  of  the  system  [2],  but  also 

determine  the  values  of  the  stationary  populations  in  the  system  [3].  Kosachiov  et  al. 

stressed  that  only  at  values  of  general  relative  phase  divisible  by 

π,  did  EIT  in  the 

system  take  place.  At  any  other  values,  the  excited  level  was  populated.  Furthermore, 

with increasing of intensity of the applied fields, the  Λ -type closed-loop system became 

more  and  more  sensitive  to  the  change  of  the  relative  phase.  Experimentally, 

phase-sensitive  population  dynamics  was  observed  in  three-  [4,  5]  and  four-level  [6,  7] 

closed-loop systems. Recently, the phase-dependent EIT was demonstrated with optically 

dense sodium vapor excited as double- Λ   atoms [8]. It has been suggested, for example, 

that closed-loop interaction schemes can be used for the phase control of photo-ionization 

 

1

[9,  10],  of  non-adiabatic  losses  in  coherent  population  transfer  process  [11],  and  of 

spontaneous  emission  [12].  On  the  other  hand,  laser  light  propagation  in  an  optically 

dense medium consisting of closed three-level atoms was theoretically investigated [13]. 

In the present paper, we investigate the effect of the relative phase of the two excited 

fields in a 

Λ

-type three level system employing a two-photon probe field. It is obvious 

that  four-wave  mixing  may  be  generated  simultaneously  and  therefore  closed-loop 

scheme forms. Different from the 

Λ -type scheme of Buckle and Kosachiov et al. where 

the  system  is  closed  by  a  radio-frequency  field  [2,  3],  now  the  ground  and  the  lower 

excited  states  are  closed  by  the  generated  FWM  field.  Consequently,  the  effect  of  the 

relative phase on the EIT is different from that of Ref. [3]. On the other hand, because the 

propagation  of  light  through  the  medium  of  ‘closed-loop’  atoms  is  governed  by  the 

Maxwell  equations  involving  the  medium  polarization,  which  depends  on  the  relative 

phase of the incident fields in like manner, the intensity of the four-wave mixing field is 

also  influenced  by  the  relative  phase.  Therefore,  the  properties  of  the  proposed  scheme 

may  be  manipulated  in  a  more  sophisticated  way  than  in  the  conventional  Λ -type 

system.   

II. The model 

We consider an atomic system consisting of ground state |c>, a lower excited state 

|b> and an upper excitation state |a> as shown in Fig.1. A coupling field at frequency 

couples  the  transition  |a>-|b>  and  a  two-photon  probe  field  at  frequency  2

dω  

pω

  is 

employed  on  the  transition  |a>-|c>.  The  four-wave  mixing  field  is  around  the  dipole 

allowed  transition  |b>-|c>  at  frequency 

fω .  The  energy  of  upper  levels  |a>、|b>  are   

aωh

  and 

bωh

, and the ground level |c> is 

. The transition between |a> and |c> is 

cωh

dipole forbidden.

Thus, the system Liouville equation for the density matrix element can be written as

It  is  known  that  the  response  of  a  medium  to  an  electric  field  is  governed  by  its 

polarization.  Consider  the  coherent  radiation  field  generated  by  the  four-wave  mixing 

processes, the polarization can be written as:

III. The effect of relative phase on FWM and EIT 

Let  us  now  consider  the  effect  of  relative  phase  on  four-wave  mixing  and 

electromagnetically  induced  transparency.  From  Eq.  (7),  we  can  obtain  the  four-wave 

mixing field. Assuming that the spontaneous emission from level |a> to level |b> is equal 

to  that  of  from  |a>  to  |c>  which  is  represented  by  r ,  while  the  spontaneous  emission 

from level |b> to |c> is omitted. In the following simulations, all the parameters are scaled 

in terms of  r .

Figure 2 displays the intensity of FWM field and the population of the upper level 

4

|a> as functions of the probing field detuning 

p∆   and the relative phase  θ. It is shown 

from Fig. 2 (left) that the intensity of FWM field depends crucially on the relative phase. 

From  Fig.  2  (right),  the  dependence  of  the  upper  level  population  on  the  detuning 

p∆  

and the relative phase  θ  is apparent. One can find that the population is independent of 

the relative phase  θ  at all time.   

Supposing 

that 

the  multi-photon  resonance  condition 

is  fulfilled,  analytic 

expressions  for 

fE

  and 

aaρ   could  be  presented.  We  firstly  discover  the  four-wave 

mixing field for the stationary case:

Here, 

bcµ   is  the  transition  dipole  moment  of  level  |b>  and  |c>.  It  is  clear  that  Eq.  (8) 

fully  determines  the  influence  of  the  relative  phase  θ  on  the  generated  four-wave 

mixing field. That is, if the relative phase is  θ, the generated four-wave mixing field will 

gain  a  phase  of 

2/πθ−

.  Hence,  even  if  the  initial  relative  phase  equals  to  zero,  the 

generated  four-wave  mixing  field  still  achieves  a  phase  of 

2/π−

.  The  Refs.  [14-16] 

have  investigated  the  generation  of  the  four-wave  mixing  field,  however,  the  phase  has 

not  been  included.  In  the  present  paper,  we  discuss  not  only  the  amplitude  but  also  the 

phase of the generated four-wave mixing field.   

Solving Eq. (3) under stationary condition of  >>t γ, we could obtain the population 

distribution of the upper excited level |a>:

Apparently, now the population of the level |a> is independent of the relative phase 

θ.  In  particular,  when 

d Ω=Ω

p

,  the  upper  level  is  unpopulated  and  EIT  appears. 

Therefore, it is the relative amplitude of the incident fields but not the relative phase that 

control the EIT. Kosachiov et al. [3] has studied the 

Λ -type three level system closed by 

a radio-frequency field and found that the population of the upper level |a> depends not 

 

5

only on the intensity of the fields but also on the relative field phase. Only at values of 

general  phase  divisible  by  π  does  EIT  in  the  system  take  place.  By  changing  the 

relative  phase  correspondingly,  one  can  both  destroy  and  restore  again  the  EIT. 

Comparatively,  we  can  say  that  the  response  of  the  loop  Λ -type  system  closed  by  the 

generated  four-wave  mixing  is  completely  different  from  the  case  of  closed  by  a 

radio-frequency field.   

Here,  Fig.  3  shows  the  dependence  of 

fE

  and 

aaρ

  on  the  relative  phase  θ 

according to the analytic expressions.

Therefore, we demonstrate here that the generated four-wave mixing field is controlled 

by  the  relative  phase  θ.  At 

θ

=

2/1(

n+

π)

,  the  generated  four-wave  mixing  field  can 

reach  to  maximum.  It  is  very  instructive  in  increasing  the  efficiency  of  frequency 

conversion.  Different  incident  field  phases  will  influence  the  conversion  efficiency.  In 

addition,  the  EIT  of  the 

Λ

-type  system  closed  by  the  generated  four-wave  mixing  is 

always  independent  of  the  relative  phase 

θ.  In  all  the  previous  works,  the  system  was 

always closed by an incident field but not a generated field and hence was controlled by 

the relative phase. 

IV. Conclusions   

We  investigate  the  effect  of  the  relative  phase  on  the  FWM  and  EIT  in  a 

Λ

-type 

three level system employing a two-photon probe field. It is found that at resonance the 

 

6

FWM intensity oscillates with the relative phase in a sine manner. This allows us to use 

such an excitation scheme for efficient frequency conversion. We analytically found the 

optimum  condition  at  resonance,  i.e. 

θ

=

2/1(

n+

)
π

.  The  phase-dependent  four-wave 

mixing  may  have  some  interesting  consequences.  It  is  a  possibility  to  control  the 

conversion efficiency by the incident laser phases without changing neither frequencies 

nor input intensities. This would provide an additional degree of freedom in the control of 

the medium and the fields. On the other hand, EIT is always independent of the relative 

phase  θ.  In  general,  the  behavior  of  the  system  is  very  different  in  the  case  of  loop 

interactions closed by a generated FWM.

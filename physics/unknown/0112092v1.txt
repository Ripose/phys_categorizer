Abstract 
Multiple  scattering  from  artificial  random  irregularities  HF-induced  in  the 
ionosphere  F  region  causes  significant  attenuation  of  both  ordinary  and 
extraordinary  radio  waves  together  with  the  conventional  anomalous 
absorption  of  ordinary  waves  due  to  their  conversion  into  the  plasma  waves. 
To  study  in  detail  features  of  this  effect,  purposeful  measurements  of  the 
attenuation of weak probing waves of the extraordinary polarization have been 
performed  at  the  Sura  heating  facility.  Characteristic  scale  lengths  of  the 
involved  irregularities  are  ~0.1-1  km  across  the  geomagnetic  field  lines.  To 
determine  the  spectral  characteristics  of  these  irregularities  from  the 
extraordinary probing wave attenuation measurements, a simple procedure of 
the  inverse  problem  solving  has  been  implemented  and  some  conclusions 
about  the  artificial  irregularity  features  have  been  drawn.    Theory  and  details 
of  experiments  have  been  stated  earlier.  This  paper  reports  results  of  two 
experimental  campaigns  carried  out  in  August  2000  and  June  2001  under 
support  of  Russian  Foundation  for  Basic  Research  (grants  No.  99-02-17525 
and No. 01-02-31008). Particularity of these experiments consisted in using of 
lower  heating  power  (20-80  MW  ERP).  Regular  character  of  the  multiple 
scattering effects has been confirmed. 

Results and discussion 
Brief statement of theory with necessary references, detailed description of our 
experimental  technique,  and  results  of  experimental  campaign  of  year  1999 
are  contained  in  our  earlier  electronic  publication  [1].  Journal  version  of  that 
paper is currently under review at the Radio Science. In the present paper we 
shall use the same methods of presentation of our results, without repetition of 
detailed explanations.

a) August 2000 campaign 
The experiments at the Sura heating facility were carried out on August 22 and 
23, 2000 in evening and night hours when the linear absorption of radio waves 
in the ionosphere D and E regions due to electron-ion collisions was negligible. 
Ionosphere  heating  was  provided  by  coherent  HF  radiation  of  ordinary 
polarization of single transmitter with output power of 250 kW. With account of 
the  antenna  gain  the  effective  radiated  power  (ERP)  was  20  MW.  Such 
relatively  low  power  level  was  chosen  intentionally,  in  contrast  with  our 
experiments  of  year  1999,  to  avoid  effect  of  large-scale  irregularity 
amplification.  Duration  of  each  heating  cycle  was  10  minutes  including  the 
active  phase  of  3  minutes  duration  (heater  on)  and  off-time  of  7  minutes. 
Overall  duration  of  the  measurements  included  into  processing  was  about  of 
4.3 hours (26 heating cycles) and 3.2 hours (19 heating cycles) on 22 and 23 
August, respectively. Amplitudes of X-mode probing waves were recorded at 7 
frequencies. Figs. 1 and 2 show amplitudes of the heating wave and the probe 
waves  averaged  over  all  available  heating  cycles.  They  give  clear  evidence  of 
presence  of  the  anomalous  attenuation  (AA)  effect  in  waves  of  both 
polarization.

This  effect  is  characterized  by  the  relation  of  the  signal  intensity  before  the 
heating  beginning  and  at  the  end  of  the  heating  on  period,  expressed  in  dB. 
Averaged  frequency  dependence  of  this  quantity  for  the  X-waves  is  shown  in

One  characteristic  feature  of  this  dependence  is  weakening  of  the  AA  effect 
right  at  (or  slightly  below)  the  probe  wave  frequency  that  corresponds  to 
reflection  near  the  center  altitude  of  the  heating  region  (it  is  marked  by 
vertical  dashed  line).  Characteristic  times  of  the  effect  development  and 
relaxation  (after  the  heater  off)  are  shown  in  Figs.  4  and  5.  The  time  of 
development  has  tendency  to  increase  when  the  probe  waves  are  reflected 
closer  to  the  heating  region.  The  time  of  relaxation  is  approximately  constant 
for all frequencies.

b) June 2001 campaign 
The  experiment  at  the  Sura  heating  facility  was  carried  out  on  June  1,  2001, 
also  in  evening  and  night  hours.  The  whole  period  was  divided  for  three 
intervals  beginning  at  17:22,  18:23,  and  19:32  MST.  During  these  intervals 
different  heating  power  values  and  different  frequency  sets  were  used.  The 
effective radiated power was 20 MW for the first and the third intervals and 80 
MW  for  the  second  one.  Duration  of  each  heating  cycle  was  10  minutes 
including the active phase of 2 minutes and off-time of 8 minutes. Amplitudes 
of  X-mode  probing  waves  were  recorded  at  7  frequencies.  Figs.  8,  9  and  10 
show amplitudes of the heating ordinary wave and the probe waves averaged 
over  all  available  heating  cycles.  The  anomalous  attenuation  effect  is  also 
evident in this case.

!N N/
,  for  several  supposed  values  of  the  background  irregularity  amplitude 
and broad altitude range. Common feature of all dependencies is relative drop 
of  the  irregularity  amplitude  in  the  heating  region  vicinity  (corresponding

Conclusion 
1)  Results  of  the  three  experimental  campaigns  at  the  Sura  heating  facility 
confirm  constant  presence  of  the  AA  effect  for  the  probe  waves  of 
extraordinary  polarization.  The  only  valid  mechanism  of  this  effect  is  multiple 
scattering. 
2)  The  AA  effect  is  observed  for  broad  frequency  range  what  means  that 
heating causes irregularity growth in a broad altitude range. 
3)  One  paradoxical  phenomenon  is  observed:  the  irregularity  growth  is  more 
effective outside of the heating region. We leave discussion of possible physical 
mechanisms of this phenomenon for another publication.

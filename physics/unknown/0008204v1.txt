Abstract 

elements 

and  non-reciprocal 

Several pulse compression systems have been proposed
for future linear colliders. Most of these systems require
hundreds  of  kilometers  of  low-loss  waveguide  runs.    To
reduce  the  waveguide  length  and  improve  the  efficiency
of  these  systems,  components  for  multi-moding,  active
switches 
are  being
developed.    In  the  multi-moded  systems  a  waveguide  is
utilized  several  times  by  sending  different  signals  over
different modes. The multi-moded components needed for
these  systems  have  to  be  able  to  handle  hundreds  of
megawatts  of  rf  power  at  the  X-band  frequency  and
above.  Consequently,  most  of  these  components  are
overmoded. We present the development of multi-moded
components  required  for  such  systems.  We  also  present
the  development  efforts 
towards  overmoded  active
component  such  as  switches  and  overmoded  non-
reciprocal components such as circulators and isolators.

1  INTRODUCTION

Rf pulse compression systems enhance the peak power
capabilities of rf sources. Indeed, it have been used as a
tool for matching the short  filling  time  of  an  accelerator
structure  to  the  long  pulse  length  generated  by  most  rf
sources such as klystrons. All rf pulse compression system
store  the  rf  energy  for  a  long  period  of  time  and  then
release it in a short time. For linac application associated
with  future  linear  colliders,  the  storage  media  is  a
waveguide  transmission  line.  The  energy  required,  to
supply a linac section or a set of linac sections, are stored
in 
these  waveguide
transmission lines has the same order as  cτ where  τ is
the pulse length required by the linac and  c is the speed
of light. For colliders based on X-band linacs such as the
NLC  [1]  and  JLC  [2]  these  lengths  are  tens  of  meters
long. Since the collider usually contains several thousand-
accelerator  sections,  the  total  waveguide  system  for  the
collider is usually hundreds of kilometers long.

these 

These  long  runs  of  waveguides  have  to  be  extremely
low-loss.  At  the  same  time  it  should  be  able  to  handle
power levels in the hundreds of Megawatts. Hence, these
waveguides  are  usually  highly  over-moded  circular
waveguide operating under vacuum.  Because of vacuum,
and tolerance requirements, these hundreds of kilometers
of  waveguide  runs  are  expensive,  hard  to  install  and
maintain.

To  reduce  these  waveguide  runs,  several  innovations
have been made both on the system and component levels:
1- RF pulse compression systems that have high intrinsic
efficiencies  have  been  suggested.  These  systems  are
Binary  Pulse  Compression  (BPC)  [3],  Delay  Line
Distribution  System  (DLDS)  [4],  and  active  pulse
compression system using resonant delay lines[5-6].

2- Enhancing the system power handling capabilities can
ultimately reduce the number of systems required. One
can use a single system that services several rf sources
and  several  accelerator  sections.  Hence,  low-loss
overmoded components have been developed for these
system, see for example [7-9]

3- Since  these  waveguide  runs  are  over-mode  one  can
utilize  these  waveguides  several  times  by  sending
signals  over  different  modes.  Such  multi-moded
systems have been suggested [10] and conceptual tests
for  components  and  concepts  have  been  performed
[11].

4- To  implement  active  pulse  compression  systems
inexpensive 
semiconductor
switching arrays have been suggested [12], and tested
[13]
In  this  paper  we  devote  section  2  to  an  accurate
formulation for the length of waveguide runs required by
several pulse compression systems. We then describe the
work done to provide a supper high power test setup for
the components required by these systems in section 3. In
section 4 we describe the multi-moded planer components
and associated tapers. Finally, in section 5, we show some
attempts to provide a semiconductor microwave switch.

COMPRESSION SYSTEMS

2.1  General Layout

To  achieve  pulse  compression  a  storage  system  is
employed to store the rf power until it is needed. Different
portions  of  the  input  rf  pulse  T  are  stored  for  different
amounts  of  time.    The  initial  portion  of  the  rf  pulse  is
stored  for  a  time  period  tm,  the  maximum  amount  of
storage time for any part of T. It is given by,

For  details  of  the  original  single  moded  system  the
reader is referred to [3].  The  system  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.
The single moded BPC, in its original form, has a length
reduction  factor 
.  It  becomes  more
economical  at  higher  compression  ratios.  However,  the
power  being  handled  by 
rf
components is doubled at every stage of the BPC system.
Naturally,  the  peak  power  depends  on  the  number  of

If  one  can  design  and  implement  a  super  high  power
switch, the intrinsic efficiency of the SLED-II system can
be  enhanced.  Intrinsic  efficiency  of  this  system  is
approximately 82% [5], and the total efficiency is slightly
reduced from that number. The efficiency in this case has
a weak dependence on the compression ration.

Table  1  shows  the  parameters  of  different  single-moded
pulse compression systems if used with the current design
of  the  Next  Linear  Collider  [1].  Clearly,  these  systems
comprise very long runs of low-loss  vacuum  waveguide.
Several innovations are required to reduce the length and
to make these systems operate at these high power levels.
These are discussed in the following sections.

 3  HIGH POWER IMPLEMENTAION OF
THE RESONANT DELAY LINE SYSTEM

(SLED-II)

More  technical  details  for  the  high  power  SLED-II
system can be found in [7]. Here we summarize the design
and the obtained results.

 To separate the input signal from the reflected signal,
one  might  use  two  delay  lines  fed  by  a  3-dB  hybrid  as
shown in Fig. 4. The reflected signal from both lines can
be made to add at the forth port of the hybrid. Fig.4 shows
the pulse-compression system. For delay lines, it uses two

22.48-meter  long  cylindrical  copper  waveguides,  each  is
12.065 cm in diameter and operating in the TE01 mode. In
theory, these over-moded  delay  lines  can  form  a  storage
cavity with a quality factor Q > 1x106. A shorting plate,
whose axial position is controllable to within ±4 µm by a
stepper  motor,  terminates  each  of  the  delay  lines.  The
input of the line is tapered down to a 4.737 cm diameter
waveguide at which the TE02 mode is cut-off; hence, the
circular  irises  which  determine  the  coupling  to  the  lines
do  not  excite  higher  order  modes  provided  that  they  are
perfectly concentric with the waveguide axis.

design  that  is  insensitive  to  its  height.  Hence  one  can
increase  the  components  height  to  any  desired  value  to
reduce the peak rf fields at the walls.

To transfer the rectangular waveguide cross-section of
these components into a circular waveguide cross-section,
thus making them compatible with the circular waveguide
delay lines, one need a special type of tapers. Tapers that
transforms waveguide modes from circular to rectangular
have been reported in [8]. These tapers could be extended
to  operate  with  several  modes  at  once.  An  example  of
such a taper is shown in Fig. 5. The tapers takes the input
of a near square waveguide carrying the TE10 and the TE20
modes and transferring them into the circular waveguide
modes TE11, and TE01 respectively. These tapers perfectly

in [17].

5  ACTIVE SYSTSEMS

   Supper-High-power microwave switches can reduce the
cost  of  the  DLDS  while  increasing  its  capabilities  for
higher  compression  ratios.  When  used  with  DLDS  one
can use one single pipe as shown in Fig. 2.

PIN diode array Active Window

•  All doping profile and metallic terminals on the window are

radial, i.e. perpendicular to electric field of the TE01 mode.  
Effect of doping and metal lines on RF signal is small when the
diode is reverse biased.

•  With forward bias, carriers are injected into I region and I region

becomes conductor   RF signal is reflected.

Fig. 4 The high power SLED-II system

A  compact  low-loss  mode  converter  excites  the  TE01
mode  just  before  each  iris  [7].  These  mode  transducers,
known as wrap-around mode converters, were developed
specifically for this application. The mode converters are
connected to two uncoupled arms of a high-power, over-
moded, planar 3-dB hybrid. This hybrid is also designed
specially  for  this  application  so  that  it  can  handle  the
super  high  power  produced  by  this  system  [9].  The
distance  from  the  irises  to  the  center  of  the  hybrid  has
been adjusted to within ±13 µm to minimize reflections to
the input port. The iris reflection coefficient is optimized
for a compression ratio of 8.

The  system  is  designed  to  operate  under  vacuum.  All
the  components  are  designed  to  handle  the  peak  fields
required  by  the  high  power  operating  conditions  of  the
system,  at  11.424  GHz  and  600  MW  peak  power  the
maximum field level is less than 40 MV/m.

The  input  and  output  pulse  shapes  of  that  system  are
shown in Fig. 4. The output pulse reached levels close to
500 MW. It was limited only by the power available from
the klystrons.

4  MULTI-MODED STRUCTURES

Multi-moded system was first suggested for the DLDS
system [14]. Several designs for multi-moded components
have  recently  been  developed  [16].  However,  the  most
promising  set  of  components  are  those  based  on  planer
microwave structures [17]. These were an extension to the
planner  hybrid  designs  developed  for  the  High  power
SLED-II Pulse compression system (see section 3 of this
article). These planner structures have the advantage of a

to  utilize  these  compact  systems  for  linear  collider
applications.
   Indeed, these active switches have attracted the attention
of numerous researchers. However, most of the concepts
that  were  suggested  are  either  very  expensive  or
impractical.  A  promising  concepts  which  combines  both
economical aspects and practical designs were suggested
recently [13]. Also, the use of a several elements of such a
switch was explored [12]. The switch is shown in Fig. 6.
The window shown operates in a waveguide carrying the
TE01 mode. Hence all the electric field lines are normal to
the doping and metalization lines. Because the TE01 mode
does  not  carry  any  axial  currents  the  separation  of  the
waveguide to supply the diodes with the required bias was
possible. These switches operated at power levels around
10  MW  at  11.424  GHz.  This  exceeds  by  orders  of
magnitude the capabilities of any known semiconductor rf
switch.

6 SUMMERY

Several  pulse  compression  systems  have  developed  for
use  with  the  rf  system  of  future  linear  colliders.  These
systems  suffer  from  very  long  waveguide  runs.  Some  of
the  systems  that  have  a  compact  nature  also  suffer  from
efficiency degradation. To improve these systems several
innovations  were  introduced.  These  innovations  increase
power  handling  capabilities,  make  the  system  more
compact  by  utilizing  several  modes  within  a  single
waveguide,  and  finally  improve  the  systems  layout  and
performance by turning them into active systems.

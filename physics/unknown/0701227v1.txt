ABSTRACT 
Recent  advances  in  optics  have  shown 
that  solitons  have  a  great  potential  for 
upgrading  the  future  optical  systems 
which  demand  fast  and  reliable  data 
transfer. 
Different 
architectures  have  evolved  to  realize  an 
optical  computer.  Due  to  difference  in 
processing  speeds  of  optical  and 
electronic  devices  and  usage  of  opto-
electronic converters the efficiency of the 
optical  computers  is  affected.  In  this 
paper  we  bring  a  novel  technique  for 
volatile  optical  memory  using  solitons 
which  would  be  part  of  realizing  an 
optical  computer.    Also  the  principle  of 
read  and  write  operations  in  the  soliton 
based  volatile  memory  systems 
is 
shown.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The  communication  revolution  of  this  era 
demands fast and reliable data transfer from 
transmitter  to  receiver.  Optical  networks 
have  become  an  essential  requirement  in 
keeping the pace of development in terms of 
transmission  of  data,  voice  and  multimedia. 
Already  the  industry  has  responded  to  this 
change  and  various 
technologies  have 
emerged in optics. The undersea fiber optic 
connections  to  ultra-long  haul  connections 
indicate 
revolution.  
Photonics promises to revolutionize the area 
of 
the  21st 
century,  just  as  electronics  revolutionized 
the past hundred years or so [1-2].  
Almost all of voice and data (internet) traffic 
is  routed  through  terrestrial  and  submarine 
optical  fiber  links,  connecting  the  world 
together.  Invention  of  the  optical  amplifiers

optical 

is  solitons  which  promises 

 
 
 
(WDM) 
technology  enabled  very  high 
capacity  optical  fiber  communication  links 
that  run  for  thousands  of  kilometers  without 
any  electronic  repeaters,  but  at  the  same 
time  brought  many  design  challenges.  In 
communications, 
fiber 
WDM 
information  bits  are  used  to  modulate  the 
(light)  carriers  at  many  wavelengths,  which 
are  then  transmitted  in  a  single  strand  of 
fiber [3].        
One of the emerging technologies in optical 
networks 
to 
benefit  the  commercial  ultra-long  haul  all-
optical  multi-terabit  networks  spanning 
distances up to many millions of kilometers. 
Solitons  are  localized  nonlinear  waves  that 
have highly stable properties that allow them  
to  propagate  very  long  distances  with  very 
little change [4-14].   
In  this  paper  we  present  a  novel  technique 
of memory storage using soliton waves. This 
technique reduces the expenditure spend in 
optical  networks  for  memory  storage.  Also 
is 
the  memory 
volatile  in  nature,  hence  could  be  used  in 
realization of all optical networks without the 
usage  of  electronic  memory  storage 
systems.  
  
2.0 SOLITON WAVES 
A soliton was first observed by Russell as a 
water  surface  wave  in  1844  Korteweg  and 
de Vries in 1895 derived known as the KdV 
equation, a model equation describing a far-
field  property  of  the  surface  wave  in  the 
lowest  order  of  dispersion  and  nonlinearity. 
When  the  equation  was  numerically  solved 
in a periodic boundary condition by Zabusky 
and  Kruskal  in  1965  a set  of  solitary  waves 
was  found  to  emerge  and  stably  pass  each 
other.  They  named  these  solitary  waves 
solitons  because  of  their  stability.  The  term 
the  KdV 
‘‘soliton’’  was 

techniques  we  present 

justified  when 

transform,  and 

equation  was  solved  analytically  by  means 
of inverse scattering transform (IST) and the 
solution  was  described  by  a  set  of  solitons.  
Solitons are regarded as a fundamental unit 
of mode in nonlinear dispersive medium and 
play  a  role  similar  to  the  Fourier  mode  in  a 
linear  medium.  In  particular,  a  soliton  being 
identified as an Eigen value in IST supports 
its particle (Fermion) concept. 
Meanwhile,  self-focusing  in  a  Kerr  medium 
was  demonstrated  and  a  spatially  localized 
solution analogous to a soliton was found to 
emerge  by 
the  cubic 
the  balance  of 
refraction.  The  model 
nonlinearity  and 
equation,  called  the  nonlinear  Schrödinger 
equation, was later found to be integrable by 
Zakharov and Shabat, also by means of the 
inverse  scattering 
the 
solution  is  given  by  a  set  of  solitons  and 
dispersive  waves.  The  theory  warrants  the 
stability  of 
the  nonlinear  Schrödinger 
solitons. 
 
3.0 SOLITONS FEATURES 
The  monolithic  integration  of  optoelectronic 
integrated  circuits  in  making  rapid  progress 
but  due  to  technical  hurdles,  are  becoming 
in  optical  networks.  The 
incompatible 
technical  hurdles 
the  switching 
timing  of  transistor,  which  is  of  minimum 
5ps, and the processing speed of 5ns. Also 
the  cost  of  these  IC’s  plays  a  negative  role 
in  building  a  optical  network  whereas  the 
theoretical  speed  of  optical  fibers  is  25THz. 
At 
the 
development  of  new  technology  called  as 
solitons  which  had  the  ability  to  resolve  the 
problems faced by optical networks.  
In  1973  A.  Hasegawa  and  F.  D.  Tappert, 
predicted  the  transmission  of  light  through 
an optical fiber is similar to the flow of soliton 
waves  [4].  Any  optical  pulse,  which  is 
transmitted into a loss less fiber, forms itself 
to become solitons like Fourier transmission 
modes in a linear transmission system. This 
result was confirmed experimentally in 1980 
by  [5].  In  1988  Mollenauer  and  Smith  were 
successful  in  demonstrating  the  first  all-
optical  soliton  transmission  by  use  of  the 
Raman  process  in  fiber  over  a  distance  of 
4000  km.  They  used  a  55-ps  soliton  pulse 
that  was  periodically  amplified  by  Raman 
pumps  injected  into  the  fiber every  41.7  km 
in  both 
the  parallel  and  anti-parallel 
directions [15-16].

application 

Due  to  the  short  pulse  duration  and  high 
stability,  solitons  could  form  the  high-speed 
communication  backbone  of 
tomorrow's 
information  super-highway.  One  of  the  key 
technological  developments  that  make  use 
of  such  soliton  pulses  for  our  future  cost-
effective and repeater less communication is 
the invention of erbium doped fiber amplifier 
(EDFA)[2].  
The  optical  transmission  losses  such  as 
dispersion  and  non-linearity 
can  be 
eliminated by transmitting Ultra short pulses. 
The  decrease  in  the  amplitude  of  the  wave 
can  also  be  eliminated  by  using  Raman 
amplification  or  EDFA  along  with  self 
induced transparency.   
In  particular,  the  use  of  40  Gbit/s  line  is 
becoming  the  standard  for  next  generation 
systems  and  dispersion  managed  solitons 
are now believed to be the major candidate. 
In 
to 
their 
transmission  between  two  points,  solitons 
have  particular  merit  for  use  in  high  speed 
optical  time  division  networks  because  of 
their  intrinsic  short  pulse  structure  and  the 
stationary  pulse  shape.  Such  applications 
are  now  being  pursued  in  various  parts  of 
the world. Thus, most internet traffics in the 
21st  century  will  be  carried  by  optical 
solitons [17]. 
Since  solitons  do  not  suffer  distortion  from 
nonlinearity  and  dispersion,  which  are 
inherent in fibers, the natural next step is to 
construct  an  all-optical  transmission  system 
in  which  fiber  loss  is  compensated  by 
optical 
amplification. 
transmission systems prior to 1991 required 
repeaters 
in 
transmission 
to  regenerate  optical 
pulses  which  have  been  distorted  by  fiber 
dispersion and loss. A repeater consists of a 
light  detector  and  light  pulse  generators. 
Consequently,  it  is  the  most  expensive  unit 
in  a  transmission  system  and  also  the 
bottleneck  to  increase  in  the  transmission 
speed.  
Repeater 
is  a  very 
innovative concept that few people believed 
to  be  possible.  In  the  absence  of  realistic 
optical  amplifiers,  Hasegawa 
in  1983 
proposed to use the Raman gain of the fiber 
itself.  The  idea  was  used  in  the  first  long 
distance  all-optical  transmission  experiment 
by Mollenauer and Smith in 1988. However, 
Mollenauer  succeeded 
the  4000  km 
repeater  less  transmission  experiment.  This

solitons.  This  experimental 
attracted  serious 
the  optical 
in 
communication community. In particular, the 
invention  of  erbium  doped  fiber  amplifiers 
(EDFA)  have  enhanced  the  concept  of  all-
optical 
to  more 
realistic  levels  as  initiated  by  Nakazawa  et 
al.  in  the  first  reshaping  experiment  of 
solitons. 
 
4.0  REALISATION  OF  AN  OPTICAL 
COMPUTER 
Realizing  an  optical  computer  has  been  a 
long  time  goal  in  optical  industry.  Different 
architectures  for  optical  processors  have 
already  been  established  and  implemented 
at  various  labs.  Various  optical  processors 
like  labyrinth,  SWAS,  DOC,  AOS,  etc  have 
successfully  demonstrated  the  strength  and 
speed  of  optical  processing.  The  optical 
processor  speed  was  reduced  due  to  the 
time  taken  by  fetching  the  instructions  and 
data  from  the  conventional  main  memory. 
The  conventional  main  memory  uses  the 
electronic 
opto-electronic 
converters  are  used  to  send  and  receive 
data from main memory and processor. The 
efficiency  of  the  optical  system  can  be 
further  increased  if  the  electronic  devices 
are  replaced  by  optical  devices  which 
minimize or avoid the use of opto-electronic 
converters.  
One of the electronic devices is RAM which 
is very essential in determining the speed of 
the  processor.  We  bring  forward  a  novel 
technique for RAM implementation using the 
is  very 
soliton  concept.  This 
effective  and  doesn’t  require  any  opto-
electronic converter.  
 
5.0 VOLATILE OPTICAL MEMORY 
We  present  here  a  novel  technique  for 
Random  access  memory 
for 
realization  for  an  optical  computer.  RAM 
plays a major role in determining the speed 
of  the  computer.  To  match  up  to  the  speed 
of  optical  processor  the  data  fetch  timings 
for  a  RAM  should  be  fast.  This  condition 
demands  for  the  RAM  which  uses  the 
the 
concept  of  photonics 
than 
rather 
electronics.  We  use 
the  established 
equations of propagation of soliton waves to

Consider  a  flat  sheet  of  fiber  optic  material 
with  variable  refractive 
that 
whenever  a  soliton  pulse  enters  into  it,  it 
direction of propagation forms a closed loop. 
Generally 
the 
direction  of  the  pulse  continuously  changes 
with the change in the refractive index of the 
fiber  similarly  in  this  flat  sheet  of  optic 
material  the  refractive  index  changes  such 
that the optical pulse makes a closed loop.   
The  pulse  gets  trapped  in  the  closed  loop 
due  to  the  internal  reflection.  Considering 
the  stable  properties  of  the  solitons,  the 
optical pulse used in this process is solitons. 
Such  a 
trapped  soliton  pulse  can  be 
interpreted  as  a  smallest  unit  of  the  optical

material.  
 
With  the  further  advance  in  the  technology, 
each  opbit  can  represent  more  than  two 
states.  This  can  be  realized  by  taking  into 
account  different  parameters  such  as 
amplitude, phase etc into account.  
We  confine  the  analysis  only  up  to  two 
states  of  the  opbit.    Taking  the  standard 
frequency of the soliton pulse for storing the 
information as 10THz and assuming that the 
circumference  of  the  loop  is  equal  to  the 
wavelength of the pulse, we obtain following 
results. The optical material is manufactured 
such  that  the  loop  formed  by  the  trapped

solitons  forms  a  circle  or  any  standard 
closed curve.  
For a 10THz wave, the circumference of the 
loop is approximately 30µm and the area of 
the  loop  is  7.15  ×  10  -11  m2.    For  practical 
reasons, the area of the loop is taken as 10-
10  m2  which  also  accounts  for  the  isolation 
gap between two adjacent opbits. Therefore 
a  1cm2  of  the  flat  optical  material  contains 
an optical memory storage capacity of more 
than 106 opbits.  Similarly the optic material 
can  contain  several  layers  of  such  memory 
storage.    A  1  cm3  of  material  can  contain  a 
capacity  of  approximately  1012  opbits.  Such 
large  dynamic  RAM  will  be  compatible  with 
the  processing  speed  of 
the  optical 
processor.    
The read  and  write  operations can  be done 
through  a  standard  laser  diode  of  10THz 
frequency (in this case). For read operations 
the data can be detected using the Boolean 
AND  technique  shown  in  [2].  A  standard 
soliton  pulse  is  sent  to  the  location  where 
the  data  is  present  and  ‘Boolean  AND’ 
operation  is  performed  with  the  data.  If  the 
output  is  ‘1’  then  data  is  equal  to  ‘1’  and 
vice-versa.   
 
6.0 CONCLUSIONS 
Though  solitons  are  in  the  emerging  state, 
the  capabilities  of  solitons  are  enormous 
compared  to  any  other  technology.  We 
presented in this paper a novel technique for 
the  volatile  memory  which  is  immensely 
helpful  in  making  a  fast  optical  computer. 
With  a  proper  engineering  design  of  the 
optical materials this type of soliton memory 
can easily be built.

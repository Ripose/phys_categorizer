We  predict  new  phenomena,  such  as  soliton  steering  and  soliton  fission,  in  optical 

lattices  that  fade  away  exponentially  along  the  propagation  direction.  Such  lattices, 

featuring  tunable  decay  rates,  arise  in  photorefractive  crystals  in  the  wavelength  range 

360-400  nm.  We  show  that  the  predicted  phenomena  offer  different  opportunities  for 

soliton control.

Optical  solitons  in  periodic  nonlinear  media  are  a  topic  of  intense  investigation. 

Various types of solitons exist in arrays of weakly coupled waveguides [1] and optically 

induced lattices [2-6]. Variation of the lattice shape in the longitudinal direction opens a 

wealth of opportunities for soliton control [7]. Harmonic longitudinal modulation results 

in  parametric  amplification  of  transverse  soliton  swinging  [7,8],  and  soliton  dragging 

occurs in dynamical lattices produced by three imbalanced interfering plane waves [9,10]. 

Strong  periodic  longitudinal  modulation  can  be  used  to  suppress  diffraction  of  linear 

beams  [11],  while  nonlinear  waveguide  array  built  of  the  properly  designed  segments 

supports  diffraction  managed  solitons  [12].  In  this  Letter  we  address  a  new  type  of 

spatially-varying  lattices  that  fade  away  along  the  propagation  direction  due  to  the 

exponential decay of the light beams that occurs in suitable wavelength bands. We show 

that the transverse mobility of solitons in such lattices changes with distance, a property 

that  might  find  applications  in  all-optical  switching  schemes.  We  consider  steering  of 

single solitons and fission of soliton bound states. Also, we show how tuning the lattice 

decay rate allows control of output soliton position. 

For  the  sake  of  generality  we  address  beam  propagation  in  a  focusing  Kerr-type 

medium with an imprinted transverse refractive index modulation, that is described by 

the nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the dimensionless field amplitude q :

decay  rate  (Fig.  1(c)).  Such  lattices  can  be  technologically  fabricated  or  induced 

optically  in  photorefractive  materials.  In  the  latter  case  one  can  tune  the  lattice 

parameters  by  changing  intensities,  intersection  angles,  and  carrying  wavelength  of 

lattice-creating  plane  waves.  For  example,  in  SBN  crystals  the  absorption  coefficient 

drops  off  from  100

cm

 to 

1 cm

 in  the  wavelength  range  360-400  nm  [13,14].  Since 

-1

-1

lattices  and  solitons  are  formed  at  different  wavelengths,  the  latter  do  not  experience 

absorption.  The  lattice  decay  rate  can  be  adjusted  also  by  changing  the  crystal 

temperature,  because  of  the  thermal  shift  of  the  absorption  band  edge.  The  transverse 

lattice profile does not vary despite its fading away gradually along the 

ξ

 direction. 

To gain intuitive insight into the soliton propagation, we start with an analytical 

approach  by  considering  shallow  rapidly  decaying  lattices.  We  consider  evolution  of 

sech-type beam q

 results  in  the  far-field  variations  of  soliton  form-factor  δχ  and

moving across the lattice and it is not trapped in the neighboring lattice channels, since 

radiative  losses  as  well  as  α  decrease  with  distance.  Asymptotically  (

ξ → ∞

)  such 

cr

beam transforms into freely walking solitons of uniform media Thus, lattice decay results 

in significant displacement of solitons even at short propagation distances. Depending on 

the  lattice  decay  rate,  solitons  perform  different  number  of  oscillations  and  may  start 

walking  freely  in  diverse  directions.  This  effect  combined  with  tunability  of  optical 

lattice parameters (including its decay rate [13,14]) might be used for soliton steering.

Dependence of soliton center shift (further we set  ξ

32=

) on lattice frequency 

end

is shown in Fig. 2(a). In rapidly decaying lattices ( δ

2∼

) soliton does not oscillate but 

is always deflected in the same direction, dictated by the input shift  η . There exists an 

0

optimal  frequency  corresponding  to  the  largest  displacement.  In  this  regime,  the 

analytical  estimate  gives  accurate  predictions  for  the  dependence  δη

int( )Ω

.  The  soliton 

shift  goes  to  zero  at  Ω →  (in  this  limit  the  refractive  index  gradient  is  too  small  to 

0

give any appreciable acceleration to the soliton before the lattice decays) and at  Ω →  

∞

(in this case lattice effects are averaged out because soliton covers many lattice periods). 

In  slowly  decaying,  or  optically  thick,  lattices  (e.g.,  δ

=

0.25

)  the  soliton  center 

performs  several  oscillations  before  soliton  escapes  from  the  input  channel.  Since  the 

oscillation period depends on the lattice frequency  Ω , this gives rise to complex  δη

int( )Ω
dependences.  Soliton  displacements  strongly  depend  on  the  input  shift  η  (Fig.  1(b)).

The larger the form-factor the richer the dependence  δη

int

. This is due to the 

fact  that  the  frequency  of  soliton  oscillations  inside  the  lattice  increases  with  χ .  Thus, 

high-amplitude  solitons  launched  with  different  shifts  may  perform  several  oscillations 

until the condition  α

crα=

 is reached. In this case escape angle changes its sign several 

times  with  η  in  contrast  to  the  escape  angle  for  low-amplitude  solitons.  This  is 

0

illustrated in Fig. 2(c) that shows the dependence

δη

int( )
χ

. The decaying lattice does not 

cause substantial displacement of broad solitons with  χ

(cid:19) 1

 covering many lattice sites, 

and  the  shift  of  integral  center  saturates  for  high-amplitude  solitons  with  χ

(cid:21)

1

.  The 

key  property  that  illustrates  the  possibility  to  control  the  output  soliton  positions  and 

escape  angles  is  shown  in  Fig.  2(d).  Growth  of  the  decay  rate  up  to  δ

∼

1

 causes 

enhancement of variations of output soliton position; then the soliton center shift slowly 

decreases  as  δ

→ ∞

.  Fine  tuning  of  the  lattice  decay  rate  results  in  considerable 

modification of output soliton position and can thus be used for soliton routing. 

Decaying lattices may also be used for efficient splitting of soliton bound states. 

Such  states form when amplitude of an input beam is N  times larger than that of the 

fundamental  soliton,  and  they  can  be  considered  as  nonlinear  superposition  of  N  anti-

phase  solitons  with  form-factors  χ  ranging  from  1  to  2

N −

1

.  The  binding  energy  of 

k

bound states is zero in Kerr media and under action of asymmetrical perturbations they 

 

4

split into the fundamental solitons contained in the input beam profile. When launched 

into decaying lattice, bound states experience fast splitting. Importantly, in contrast to 

lattices  invariable  in  ξ  [16],  the  emerging  solitons  move  apart  and  effectively  separate 

even for  p

1>

, instead of being trapped in the nearest lattice channels. In this case, by 

varying  the  decay  rate  of  the  lattice,  its  depth  and  frequency  one  can  control  the 

amplitudes  χ  and asymptotic escape angles  α . Dynamics of soliton fission in optically 

k

k

thick  lattices  is  complex  because  single-soliton  components  perform  several  reflections 

inside  lattice  channel  before  separation.  Here  we  focus  on  optically  thin  lattices,  where 

complete splitting occurs at short distances (see Fig. 3(a), 3(b) showing fission dynamics 

for three-soliton bound state

frequency  calculated  with  the  aid  of  perturbative  inverse  scattering  transform.  Output 

angles  α  for high-amplitude solitons tend to zero at Ω →  and  Ω → . The soliton

3(b)  with  Fig.  3(c)),  confirming  the  potential  of  the  decaying  lattices  for  controllable 

multi-soliton fission.

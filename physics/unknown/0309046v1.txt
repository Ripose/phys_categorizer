THAT HYDROGENATED SUBSTANCES INCREASE  

THE RADIOACTIVITY INDUCED BY NEUTRONS

Università di Roma «La Sapienza»* 

At the Domus Galilæana in Pisa, many original documents and records are kept, which belong 

to  the  scientific  activity  carried  out  by  Enrico  Fermi  until  1938.  Such  documents  range  from 

Fermi’s very first works  – including the manuscript of the thesis for his degree  – to some notes 

written a few months before Fermi’s departure to the United States. Such papers are of the highest 

importance in analysing the activity which Fermi carried out while in Italy. 

1. – Experiments on neutrons and the discovery of the property of hydrogenated subs tances 

The  Roman  group  headed  by  Fermi,  which  included  Edoardo  Amaldi,  Oscar  D’Agostino, 

Bruno  Pontecorvo,  Franco  Rasetti  and  Emilio  Segrè,  worked  very  hard  on  artificial 

radioactivity  induced  by  neutrons  from  March  to  October  1934  and  even  later.  It  is  not 

surprising,  then,  what  a  vast  number  of  original  papers  the  Domus  Galilæana  offers  as  a 

documentation of that fundamental scientific work.  

In  carrying  out  my  work  for  the  Doctorate  of  research  in  Physics  –  headed  by  professor 

Fabio Sebastiani  –  I  compared  those  documentary  sources  with  the  supported  evidences,  the 

personal  recollections,  concerning  the  pioneering  researches  on  radioactivity  induced  by 

neutrons. Such a comparison was restricted, actually, only to the discovery of the property of 

hydrogenated  substances,  i.e.,  was  restricted  to  only  a  part  of  the  whole  of  the  researches 

worked  out  in  Rome  in  1934.  Still,  even  at  such  a  preliminary  analysis,  very  interesting 

conclusions can be drawn from the documents kept at the Domus Galilæana.

1.1. – Towards radioactivity induced by neutrons 

As early as 1919, Ernest Rutherford discovers that nitrogen nuclei emit protons, if they are 
-particles. Still in the early Thirties, disintegrations produced by  a
irradiated by  a
-particles are 
widely  investigated,  amo ng  others,  by  James  Chadwick.  On  February  17th  1932,  the  latter 

announces the Possible Existence of a Neutron. Just the day before, Norman Feather observed 

some  traces  in  a  cloud  chamber,  produced  by  the  penetrating  radiation  from  beryllium.  The 

following week, those traces are correctly interpreted as due to nitrogen nuclei disintegrated by 

neutrons from beryllium. Rutherford announces Feather’s discovery before the Royal Society 
on March 18th; in May, that discovery is published in the Proceedings.1 

At  that  time,  only  weak  sources  of  neutrons  were  available  –  only  one  neutron  is  emitted 

when  beryllium  is  irradiated  with  about  100,000  a

-particles.  Nevertheless,  Feather  himself 

observes that of 130 cases of interaction between a neutron and a nitrogen nucleus, about 30 
result  in  disintegration;  in  the  case  of  a

-particles,  instead,  elastic  collisions  outnumber 

inelastic collisions by a factor of the order of 1000:1. That Feather ascribes to «the different 

extent of the external fields of the two particles». 

In  January  1934,  the  first  signs  of  the  discovery  having  been  discussed  since  the  Solvay 

Conference  the  previous  October,  Frédéric  Joliot  and  Irène  Curie  show  that  a

-particles can 

induce radioactivity in some light elements  – the first they activated were boron, magnesium 

and  aluminium.  The  Joliot-Curie  themselves  conclude  that  disintegrations  could  possibly 

occur also by means of some different kinds of particles. 

Fermi, then, guesses that neutrons can not only produce disintegrations – like those Feather 

observed – but could also produce artificially radioactive elements. Neutrons, moreover, due 
to  their  electrical  neutrality,  could  also  activate  heavy  nuclei.  On  March  25th  1934,  Fermi 
announces  he  has  observed  artificial  radioactivity  induced  by  neutrons.2  Since  then,  the 

Roman  group  headed  by  Fermi  systematically  investigate  radioactivity  induced  by  neutrons, 

getting as far as investigating uranium. The very experiments with uranium let Fermi believe  

– with some hesitations, actually  – he has discovered two new elements with atomic numbers 93 

and 94. Concerning that, it might be interesting to report that the documents kept in Pisa show 

that,  since  May  1934,  it  became  a  habit  in  Fermi’s  laboratories  to  use  the  symbol  «Ao»  to 

signify the Ausonium, the hypothetical new element of atomic number 93; for Hesperium, of 

atomic  number  94,  the  symbol  «Hs»  was  used.  That  seems  to  contradict  Segrè,  who  recalls 

that, after the Director of the Institute Orso Mario Corbino had delivered a speech before the 
Accademia dei Lincei on June 4th, Fermi «strongly resisted the temptation to give new names 
to the so-called transuranic elements». 3

1.2. – Personal recollections of a new discovery 

At first, the activity induced is classified as «weak», «medium» and «strong». As Amaldi 
and Segrè recall, 4 for the sake of a finer investigation the activity with a two minutes half- life 

induced in silver is soon chosen as a test activity. At this point, Fermi and his group notice that 

the environment seems to affect the activation, and they decide to elucidate what really occurs. 

To  this  end,  they  put  some  lead  near  the  source  of  the  neutrons;  moreover,  they  decide  to 

interpose the lead as a shield, between the source and the target to be activated. 

In 1984, Amaldi so recalls what happened fifty years before: «On the morning of October 
22nd  most  of  us  were  busy  doing  examinations  and  Fermi  decided  to  proceed  in  making  the 
measurements». Still, according to Amaldi, Fermi suddenly replaced the lead, he had not used 

yet,  with  some  odd  piece  of  paraffin:  as  an  unexpected  result,  the  activity  increased  by  an 

appreciable amount. Fermi promptly came to an explanation for what had happened: neutrons 

slowed down by hydrogenated substances increase their efficiency. «The same afternoon the 

experiment  was  repeated  in  the  pool  of  the  fountain  in  the  garden  of  the  Institute.  […]  The 
evening  of  October  22nd  all  the  group  came  to  my  house  and  a  letter  announcing  our  results 
was written to La Ricerca Scientifica», Amaldi writes.5 

There  is  no  doubt  at  all,  according  to  Amaldi’s  account,  that  everything  happened  on 
Monday, October 22nd 1934: the discovery of the effects due to the paraffin, the interpretation 
of those experiments, the experiments with water, as well as the very writing the article for La 

Ricerca Scientifica.  

Before  Amaldi,  in  1970  Segrè  wrote:  «[…]  a  lead  wedge  was  prepared  for  insertion 

between the neutron source and the detector […] but Fermi suddenly decided to try filters of 

light elements first. […] It is very hard for me, after so many years, to remember exactly what 
happened, but there is no doubt that paraffin was used first on the morning of October 22». 6 

Paraffin was used first on the morning of October 22… 

In  1955,  i.e.  twenty-one  years  after  those  events,  Persico  recalled  that  on  the  morning of 
October  22nd  1934,  Fermi’s  group  realised  that  the  radioactivity  induced  in  a  target  of  silver 
increased  a  lot,  if  some  paraffin  was  placed  nearby. 7  Pontecorvo  as  well  –  who  joined  the 

group  in  September  1934,  shortly  after  his  degree  –  in  1972  says:  «[…]  On  the  morning  of 
October  22nd  1934,  Fermi  made  up  his  mind  to  measure  the  radioactivity  of  a  cylinder  of 
silver,  by  passing  the  neutrons  from  the  source  through  a  ledge  of  paraffin  he  had  rapidly 
prepared, instead of passing them through a ledge of lead». 8 

A  laconic  account  is  given  by  Rasetti  in  1968:  «Nell’autunno  [del  1934]  si  aggiunse  al 

nostro  gruppo  Pontecorvo,  e  tosto  scoprimmo  gli  effetti  sorprendenti  che  certe  sostanze, 

l’acqua  e  la  paraffina,  producevano  nell’intensificare  la  radioattività  indotta  quando  si 

trovassero nelle vicinanze della sorgente di neutroni e dell’elemento bombardato. Non passò 

 

3 

un  giorno  che  Fermi  aveva  già  trovato  la  spiegazione  di  questi  effetti  paradossali  nel 

rallentamento che i neutroni subiscono urtando più volte contro i nuclei di idrogeno contenuti 
nell’acqua o simili sostanze».9 

Of  all  the  accounts  quoted  here,  the  first  one  in  a  chronological  order  is  provided  by 

Fermi’s wife, Laura Capon. In 1954, she published a biography of Fermi, in which she recalls: 

«A  plate  of  lead  made  the  activity  increase  slightly.  Lead  is  a  heavy  substance.  “Let's  try  a 

light  one  next,”  Fermi  said,  “for  instance,  paraffin.”  The  experiment  with  paraffin  was 
performed on the morning of October 22». 10  

Each account differs from the others, and has its own shade of meaning. Nevertheless, apart 

from  Rasetti’s  account,  in  which  no  date  is  mentioned  at  all,  all  the  others  come  to  an 
agreement, in saying that Fermi used paraffin on October 22nd 1934. 

He, whose account does not echo the others, is D’Agostino, the chemist of the group. In a 

controversial  reconstruction  of  those  events,  D’Agostino  ascribes  Fermi’s  discovery  of  the 

effect due to hydrogenated substances, to the presence of a pail with water, rather than to the 

presence some odd piece of paraffin: the charwoman used to leave the pail beneath the bench, 

upon  which  Pontecorvo  generally  carried  out  his  experiments.  D’Agostino  recalls:  «Sì, era 

vero: l’attività dell’argento radioattivo variava a seconda che nel secchio c’era o non c’era 

l’acqua.  Palesemente  eccitato  Fermi  suggerì  ancora:  “Proviamo  a  immergere  l’argento  in 

una grande quantità d’acqua!”. Era lì a portata di mano la fontana del giardino […] , in un 

cortile  interno  dell’Istituto.  Erano  le  ore  15  del  22  ottobre.  […]  L’acqua  moltiplicava la 
radioattività dell’argento di un fattore assai grande».11  

Even  though  D’Agostino  provides  an  account  which  totally  disagrees  with  the  others,  he 
still  asserts  that  it  was  October  22nd.  Yet,  further  on  in  his  report  a  detail  appears,  which  is 

inconsistent with such a date: according to D’Agostino, in fact, he himself suggested that the 

discovery of the property of hydrogenated substances should be patented. Some in the group 

were  sceptical  about  that  suggestion.  Nevertheless,  Fermi  settled  to  refer any decision to  the 

Director  of  the  Institute,  senator  Corbino.  «Ricordo  anche  che  queste  nostre  discussioni 

avvennero di sabato. Il senatore Corbino era fuori Roma e sarebbe tornato soltanto due giorni 
dopo.  Così  ogni  decisione  fu  rimandata  al  lunedì».12 The  brevetto [patent] number 324458 
was  asked  through  a  letter  dated  October  26th  1934:  it  was  Friday. 13 Then, according to the 

episode which D’Agostino here reports, the discovery of the effect of hydrogenated substances 
necessarily occurred no later tha n Saturday, October 20th. 

Despite the more or less marked discrepancies revealed in all the accounts reported above, the 

agreement about the date is really complete. To the point that it seems even suspicious: we saw 

that, according to Segrè, it was «very  hard […], after so many years, to remember exactly what 
happened». Is it really possible that, in spite of such a difficulty, all of them  – except Rasetti, if 

any,  and  in  spite  of  the  inconsistencies  which  D’Agostino’s  report  holds  –  could  exactly 

 

4 

remember  the  date  in  which  Fermi  did  discover  the  properties  of  hydrogenated  substances? 
Moreover,  Fermi  himself  failed  to  mention  October  22nd  in  his  only  known  recalling  of  that 
discovery, which he related to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar between Autumn 1952 and Spring 
1953:14 a bit singular is the very fact that, in spite of this, all the other accounts  – again, except 
Rasetti’s one – do state precisely that date.  

The  matter  gains  a  particular  importance,  in  the  light  of  the  documents  held  at  the  Domus 

Galilæana. 

 

1.3. –Records at the archives of the Domus Galilæana 

Amaldi  clearly  states  that  the  results  of  the  first  experiments  with  paraffin  were  recorded  on 
notebook  B.1,  nowadays  kept  in  Pisa.15  In  the  very  first  pages,  some  measurements  are  recorded, 

which were obtained in presence of the «castelletto» [«little castle»], a small squared fencing made of 

small bricks of lead: it was used to investigate the effects of the environment on the activation of silver. 

Starting from page 8, the effects on that activation, due to paraffin, are investigated. Anyway the date 
of October 20th ’34 – instead of October 22nd – is clearly written at the top of the page  (fig. 1). One 

could perhaps think of an error. Nevertheless, some more records confirm that the experiments took 
place on October 20th. Furthermore, they also add some more details of interest. 

Figure 1. – Page 8 of notebook B.1, dated October 20th 1934, recording experiments with paraffin.

In Report R.6, many graphs and about ninety «verbali» – i.e. imprinted forms to record 

the  results  of  the  experiments  –  are  kept.  They  record  the  results  of  the  experiments 

worked  out  since  October  1934.  One  of  these  verbali,  dated  October  21st 1934, reports 
that since 20 (8 p.m.) of Saturday, October 20th, until 9.30 a.m. of Sunday, October 21st, 

caesium  is  irradiated  while  soaked  under  some  water;  the  number  is  also  reported  of  the 

radon-beryllium source of neutrons used: source number 16. The radioactivity induced in 

caesium  is  measured,  and  then  reported.  Another  «verbale»  reports  that  since  20  of 
October  20th,  till  9.30  of  the  following  morning,  rubidium  nitrate  (RbNO3) is irradiated; 

the number of the source of neutron is not specified, but the agreement on the hours seems 

to suggest that the source is the same used for caesium: source number 16. 

So, caesium was irradiated while soaked under water as from the evening of October 
20th :  that  was  the  same  day  when,  according  to  notebook  B.1,  the  experiment  with 

paraffin was carried out. 

An  approximate  check  of  the  dates  is  possible,  if  we  refer  to  the  numbers  of  the 

sources  of  neutrons  used.  In  Report  R.9,  in  fact,  the  numbers  and  the  activities  are 

reported of the sources that, day by day, are used in the experiments with neutrons. Those 

activities  decay  following  an  exponential  law,  with  half- life  of  about  four  days. 

Unfortunately, the only data missing are precisely those referring to the activity of source 

number 16 – the reason perhaps being that, in those days, Fermi’s group was too deeply 

involved in the real experiments to be concerned with the activity of the source. Such a 

difficulty  is  not  serious,  indeed,  because  the  sources  are  progressively  numbered 

according  to  a  chronological  ordering:  by  only  considering  the  dates  when  the  other 

sources  were  prepared,  we  can  be  quite  sure  that  source  number  16  could  be  used  by 

Fermi and his group in about the middle of October 1934  (fig. 2). In other words, though 

it  is  not  possible  to  reconstruct  day  by  day  the  activity  of  the  source  used  to  irradiate 

caesium,  it  is  still  possible  to  reconstruct from  Report  R.9  that  source  number  16  could 

provide  an  effective  flux  of  neutrons  just  spanning  October  20th.  This  confirms  the 

trustworthiness  of  the  date  reported  on  the  record  about  caesium,  and  it  excludes,  for 

example,  that  the  experiment  with  caesium  was  carried  out  on  November  20th: at that 

date,  only  the  activity  of  the  sources  number  19  (60  mCi),  20  (220  mCi)  and  21  (440 

mCi) were still enough for experimental purposes.

Figure 2. – From Report R.9 : facsimile of the record of the sources of neutrons, concerning the months of October 
and November 1934. In each column, the number of the source and the daily activity of the latter are recorded. 

Going  on  with  our  analysis  of  the  records  contained  in  Report  R.6,  we  find  aluminium 
«irradiato  in  H2O a 10 cm per 2'» on October 21st. Since 20 of Sunday, October 21st, some 
more substances are irradiated while soaked under water: sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), until 9.45 
a.m.  of  Monday,  October  22nd;  lithium  hydroxide  (LiOH),  until  10  a.m.;  platinum  until  10.30 
a.m. (fig. 3); ruthenium and strontium until 12 a.m. In each case of these, it is clearly stated that 

1) irradiation took place in water and 2) the source of neutrons used was source number 16. The 

latter  point  makes  us  conclude  that,  being  only  one  the  source,  possibly  all  of  those samples 
were soaked under water the one next to the other, while irradiated. On Monday, October 22nd, 

 

7 

by means of source number 16, are also irradiated «in H2O Pb metallico» – between 13 and 15 –, 

and metallic antimony «in provetta in H2O» – in a test-tube, between 13 and 16.20. 

 

Figure 3. – From Report R.6: record about platinum, which was irradiated, like other substances, while soaked under 
water during the night between October 21st and October 22nd. 
 
On  October  20th,  calcium  fluoride  (CaF2)  turns  out  to  have  been  irradiated,  apparently 

without water – in any case, calcium fluoride was largely investigated in the preceding months. 
Ammonium iodide (NH4I) as well turns out to be irradiated on October 20th, between 13 and 14, 

in a test-tube containing some water. Anyway, in these last two cases, the real date is not so sure, 

since the number of the source is not stated. On the other hand, ammonium nitrate  (NH4NO3) 
turns  out  to  have  been  irradiated  on  October  15th,  while  potassium  carbonate  (K2CO3)  on 
October  16th.  Those  last  two  dates,  however,  are  clearly  wrong,  since  the  sources  used  were 

number 19 and 20: they would be active only since the middle of the following November. 

 

 

2. – Conclusions  
 
We can thus come to the conclusion that the experiments with paraffin were carried out on 
October 20th 1934, as reported on notebook B.1, and not on October 22nd, as has been believed 

so far. Moreover, exactly the same procedure was worked out during the following two nights: 
since the evening of that October 20th, some specimens were soaked under water and irradiated 
during the following night, and the same happened on the night between 21st and 22nd – that 

8 

procedure  has  an  odd  analogy  with  D’Agostino’s  account,  according  to  which  the  pail  with 

water, that the charwoman  used  to  leave  beneath  Pontecorvo’s  bench,  was  «messo alla sera e 

ritirato poi al mattino» [«placed the evening and then taken away in the morning»]. 

The documents kept at the  Domus Galilæana, then, contradict what Fermi’s collaborators 

and his wife reported. 

One  probable  check  for  our  conclusion  is  annotated  on  one  record  dated  November  20th 

1934,  kept  in  Report  R.1.  There  are  recorded  the  results  obtained  with  sodium  carbonate, 

irradiated  alternately  in  air  and  in  paraffin  –  using  source  number  20.  There  is  reported  that 

«Le  misure  giusti  [sic ],   senza  sbagli  geometrici,  sono  quelle  del  21.10.34»  [«The  correct 

measurements, without geometrical mistakes, are those of 21.10.34»] (fig. 4). 

Figure 4.  – From Report R.1 : results of experiments carried out – with some paraffin – in November, in order to 
check some earlier results which dated back  to October 21st.

One could perhaps object, that as many as six accounts agree on the date of October 22nd. 

Nevertheless, if it is certainly true that a whole group of persons reconstructed those events, it 

is  likewise  true  that  the  experiments  were  carried  out  and  the  results  were  recorded  at  the 

presence  of  that  same  group  of  persons.  There  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  all  of  them  were 
wrong, when writing on the records the date of October 20th and then the date of October 21st – 

even if some inaccuracy really occurs elsewhere  –, while they were right when, some decades 
later,  reported  the  date  of  October  22nd.  It  is  really  possible,  rather,  that  the  mistake  first 

occurred  perhaps  in  the  biography  written  by  Laura  Fermi  in  1954,  and  then  ‘propagated’ 

through  Persico’s  account,  to  those  of  all  the  others:  such  a  circumstance  could  also  explain 

the inconsistencies in D’Agostino’s report. 

The  shift  of  two  days  in  dating  those  events  is  not  so  much  important  in  itself.  Its  major 

importance  is,  instead,  that  such  a  shift  shows  that  the  accounts  that  have  been  supported  so 

far, and regarding the experiments carried out at via Panisperna by Fermi and his group, must 

be examined closely: such accounts must be carefully analysed and compared with the archive 

records, even there, where they show a complete agreement among themselves. Any historical 

study  to  come,  concerning  the  experiments  worked  out  by  Fermi  and  his  group  on neutrons, 

cannot neglect such a check. 

Addendum  

 
It  is  worth  noting  that,  according  to  the  pieces  of  information  which  emerge  from  the 
catalogue  of  Fermi’s  documents  at  the  Domus  Galilæana16  –  and  which  seem  to  have 

apparently  been  confirmed  by  now,  by  the  preliminary  analysis  I  carried  out  –,  we  can 
conclude that any sort of Fermi’s documents break up on March 26th 1938. The real interest in 
noting  such  a  detail  is  that  March  26th  1938  is  precisely  the  date  when  Ettore  Majorana 

disappeared. The question  is worth being examined closely.

[Italian  transl.,  B.  Pontecorvo,  Enrico  Fermi,  Pordenone,  Edizioni  Studio  Tesi,  1972,  pp.  81-82.  The  Italian 
translation,  from  wich  the  English  version  here  reported  is  drawn,  reads:  «La  mattina  del  22  ottobre 1934 
Fermi  decise  di  misurare  la  radioattività  del  cilindro  d’argento  ‘facendo  passare’  i  neutroni  dalla  sorgente 
attraverso un cuneo non di piombo, ma di paraffina che lui stesso aveva in fretta approntato»]. 

9  In  Autumn  [1934],  Pontecorvo  joined  our  group.  We  soon  discovered  the  surprising  effects  that  some 
substances  like  water  or  paraffin  have,  when  they  are  placed  near  the  source  of  neutrons  and  near  the 
bombarded  element,  of  increasing  the  radioactivity  they  induce.  Within  not  even  one  day,  Fermi  explained 
those  paradoxical  effects,  and  ascribed  them  to  the  slowing  down  suffered  by  neutrons  when  colliding 
repeatedly against hydrogen nuclei contained in water or similar substances. Author’s translation into English,

11  Yes,  it  was  really  true:  the  activity  of  the  radioactive  silver  changed,  depending  on  the  fact  that  some  water 
was, or instead was not inside the pail. Visibly excited, Fermi moreover suggested: «Let’s try to soak the silver 
in a large quantity of water!». Within reach was the fountain in the garden of the Institute. It was 15 o’ clock of 
October 22nd. […] Water increased the activity induced in silver by a very large amount. Author’s translation,

12  I  can  remember,  as  well,  that  those  discussions  of  ours  took  place  on  Saturday.  Senator  Corbino  was  not  in 
Rome, and would be back only within two days. For this reason, any sort of decision was postponed to the next 
Monday. Author’s translation, from:  O. D’Agostino,  L’era atomica incominciò a Roma nel 1934, 3rd episode,

15 The classification of the records kept in Pisa, to which I refer, is the one reported in M. Leone, N. Robotti, C.A. 
Segnini, Fermi Archives at the  Domus Galilæana in Pisa, «Physis», XXXVII, 2 (2000), pp.501-533. It is worth 
noting  that  the  documentation  kept  at  the  Domus  Galilæana,  and  concerning  the  experiments  carried  out  on 
uranium by Fermi and his group, appears to be incomplete:  Report R.2 contains a few hundreds of numbered 
records,  but  such  a  numeration  is  repeatedly  interrupted,  in  a  way  which  clearly  shows  that  some  mo re 
hundreds of records are missing.

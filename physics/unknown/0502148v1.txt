Stability of laminar flows  
Transition to turbulence  
Instability of shear flows 

         Abstract    In  this  note,  we  propose  a  new  idea  by  analyzing  the  basic  disturbance 
equations,  and  give  starting  equations  for  understanding  the  instability  phenomena  of  laminar 
flows  and  transition  to  turbulence.  It  is  considered  that  there  is  an  interaction  between  the 
disturbance  and  the  base  flow  in  the  process  of  disturbance  amplification.  The  transition  to 
turbulence  is  the  result  of  this  interaction.  The  linearity  of  the  disturbance  in  linear  theory  is 
oversimplified the problem. It is pointed out that the development of disturbance is subjected to 
the influence of the base flow, and these effects must be included in the governing equations of 
the disturbance.  
        Key Words: Instability, Disturbance Equation, Turbulence Transition, Parallel Flows.

Introduction 
        Since Reynolds (1883) [1] famous experiments on pipe flow demonstrating the transition 
from  laminar  to  turbulent  flows,  a  large  number  of  scientists  have  been  investigating  this  for 
more  than  120  years.  Outstanding  progress  has  been  achieved  in  understanding  the  turbulent 
flow phenomena, predicting the properties of turbulence flows as well as developing the basic 
turbulent  theory.  However,  the  mechanism  of  turbulence  generation  still  remains  a  great 
challenge today. Lumley and Yaglom (2000) [2] reviewed the advance of 100 years in turbulent 
researches, they concluded that it is very far from approaching a comprehensive theory and the 
final resolution of the turbulent problem. Various stability theories emerged during the past 100 
years, but few are satisfactory in the explanation of the various flow instabilities and the related 
complex flow phenomena in the turbulence generation. 
 
         The origin of turbulence is a fundamental issue for the turbulence research. Most studies 
for the turbulence origin are to study the stability of a base flow under a disturbance. According 
to the stability theory, if the flow is stable, the disturbance will decay with the time; otherwise it 
will  increase  and  the  flow  will  be  unstable.  The unstable  flow  will  evolve  to  a  turbulent  flow 
state eventually under the continuous disturbance.  
 
        Various stability theories have been developed during the past century. For example, linear 
stability analysis, energy method, week non-linear method, and second stability theory, etc. have 

1

 

 

been used in the researches [3-8]. Although some agreement is achieved between the theory and 
the experiments for some cases, the entire state-of-the-art in this topic is not satisfactory. In this 
note, we will propose a  new  approach  to better understand the instability of laminar flow  and 
transition to turbulence. 
 
Linear Stability Theory 
         Linear  stability  theory  exists  from  the  year  of  Rayleigh  (1880)  [9]  who  did  the  inviscid 
stability analysis. This theory is still used now for the stability analysis, but the analysis includes 
the  viscosity  which  solves  the  Orr-Sommerfeld  equation.  Linear  stability  analysis  was 
successful  for  some  flows  such  as  Taylor-Couette  flow,  Dean  flow,  and  Rayleigh-Benard 
problem, etc. But it is failed for wall bounded parallel flows such as Plane Poiseuille flow and 
pipe Poiseuille flow, and plane Couette flow [3-8]. The pipe Poiseuille flow (Hagen-Poiseuille) 
is  stable  by  linear  stability  analysis  for  all  the  Reynolds  number,  Re.    However,  experiments 
showed that the flow would become turbulence if Re (=
) exceeds a value of 2000 (see 
Table 1) [10]. Experiments also showed that disturbances in a laminar flow could be carefully 
avoided or considerably reduced, the onset of turbulence was delayed to Reynolds numbers up 
to  Re=O(10⁵)  [10].  For  Re  above  2000,  the  characteristic  of  turbulence  transition  depends  on 
the disturbance amplitude and frequency, below which transition from laminar to turbulent state 
does not occur regardless of the initial disturbance amplitude. Linear stability analysis of plane 
parallel flows gives critical Reynolds number Re (=
) of 5772 for plane Poiseuille flow 
[see  3-8],  while  experiments  show  that  transition  to  turbulence  occurs  at  Reynolds  number  of 
order 1000. For plane Couette flow, linear stability analysis shows that the flow is stable foe all 
the Re (=
), but it becomes unstable for Re=370 in experiments [11-12]. One resolution of 
these  paradoxes  is  that  the  domain  of  attraction  for  the  laminar  state  shrinks  for  large  Re  (as 
γRe  say,  with  γ<0)  in  linear  stability  thoery,  so  that  small  but  finite  perturbations  lead  to 
transition [10-11]. However, this explanation does still not provide a good understanding for the 
problem  and  a  satisfying  prediction,  compared  to  the  experiments.  Grossmann  (2000)  [12] 
commented  that  this  discrepancy  of  linear  stability  analysis  demonstrates  that  nature  of  the 
onset-of-turbulence mechanism in this flow must be different from an eigenvalue instability.

  Table  1  Critical  Reynolds  number  for  a  few  wall-bounded  parallel  flows.  U  is  the  averaged 
velocity, 
0u  the  velocity  at  the  mid-plane  of  the  channel,  D  the  diameter  of  the  pipe,  h  is  the 
half-width  of  the  channel  for  plane  Poiseuille  flow  and  plane  Couette  flow  (Fig.1).  From  the 
comparison  in  this  table,  it  is  concluded  that  linear  stability  analysis  is  not  liable  for  wall-
bounded parallel flows. 
 
 
         Linear stability theory is based on the linearized equation of disturbance which is obtained 
from  the  Navier-Stokes  equation.  The  presuppositions  of  this  theory  are  that  the  disturbance 
equation for the resulting velocity U+u satisfies the Navier-Stokes equation, and the base flow 
U  after  overlapped  by  disturbance  u  still  satisfies  the  Navier-Stokes  equation.    These 
hypothesizes  are  not  proved  yet  so  far  and  are  of  doubt  although  they  are  applied  to  many 
problems today and this theory represents the state-of-the-art of the stability theory.

Proposed New Equation 
       Let us consider that there is a steady laminar flow in a duct, which satisfy the Navier-Stokes 
equation.  The  conservations  of  mass  and  momentum  for  an  incompressible  Newtonian  fluid 
(neglecting gravity force) can be expressed as,

Now, we install a grid at the inlet of the duct to generate a small disturbance. We also assume 
that the flow rate is not reduced by the resistance of the grid.  We think that the resultant flow 
field V=U+u may not be certain to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equation. 
 
       In  order  to  carry  out  the  analysis,  now  we  assume  that  U+u  satisfies  the  Navier-Stokes 
equation,

In  these  equations,  the  subscript  1  describes  the  difference  of  the  meaning  of  the  velocities 
which represented in Equation (5) and (6) from those in Equation (3) and (4). Here, assumption 
is  made  that  U1  satisfied  Navier-Stokes  equation  (i.e.  Eq.(5)),  the  Eq.(6)  is  obtained  by 
deducting the Eq.(5) from the Equation for U+u (Eq.(4)). The linear stability analysis is usually 
carried out using Eq.(6) and dropping off the nonlinear term 
. Actually, we are still not 
sure that the base flow U1 exactly satisfies Navier-Stokes equation (5). In fact, the base flow and 
the  disturbance  flow  may  interact  each  other,  and  influence  mutually.  However,  these 
interactions are ignored when Eq,(5) and (6) are constructed. 
 
        If  we  want  to  exactly  analyze  the  flow  using  these  two  equations  (Eq.(5)  and  (6)), 
necessary  correction  must  be  made.  Now  we  rewrite  Eq.(5)  and  (6)  as  by  adding  a  correction 
function,

1f  and

1g are  two  functions  representing  the  effect  from  the  opposition  of  U 1  or  u 1 , 
Here, 
respectively.  The  function  1f  represents  the  influence  of  the  disturbance  u 1 on  the  base  flow 
1g  is 
U 1, even it is small compared to the solution of Eq.(5) at small disturbance. The function 
the  effect  of  the  base  flow  U 1 on  the  disturbance  flow,  the  influence  of  this  term  may  not  be 
small  relative  to  the  solution  of  Eq.(6).  It  may  give  an  important  Impact  on  the  evolution  of 
disturbance velocity u 1.  
 
        The  motivation  to  construct  the  Eq.(7)  and  Eq.(8)  is  based  on  the  observation  that  the 
viscous  force  of  the  base  flow, 
,  should  have  an  important  effect  on  the  disturbance 
development  [13-14].  It  has  a  strong  damping  role  to  the  disturbance.  But,  this  influence 
disappears in Eq.(6) after dropping off the terms of the base flow. As is well known, there are 
two  competing  influences  from  the  base  flow  with  the  variation  of  the  Reynolds  number,  i.e., 
inertia and viscous forces. When the flow is subjected to a small disturbance, both inertia and 
viscous  forces  of  the  base  flow  have  effects  on  this  disturbance.  However,  in  Eq.(6),  only  the 
partial effect of inertia of base flow which is from the nonlinearity remains and that of viscous 
force  of  base  flow  vanishes.  This  is  obviously  not  reasonable.  The  stability  of  a  laminar  flow 
might  be  much  different  from  the  mechanical  analogue  of  a  simple  linear  oscillator.  The 
evolution of disturbance in laminar flow is encompassed and affected by the media of viscous 
flows. But, the motion of a linear oscillator is free of the influence of the environmental media 
under  the  given  existing  forces.    The  treatment  of  linearity  for  disturbance  in  linear  theory  is 
oversimplified the problem. To compensate the simplification of the equation, it should not be to 
simply account for the non-linearity due to the inertia, both the effects of the viscous force and 
the inertia force of the base flow should be included. 
 
        Only  we  solve  Eq.(7)  and  (8),  can  we  get  the  solution  which  satisfies  the  physical 
1g  needs  further  extensive 
phenomena  exactly.  However,  the  determination  of 
researches,  and  it  seems  not  easy.  This  note  provides  a  starting  point  for  understanding  this 
complicated physical phenomenon. 
 
Concluding Remarks 
       The development of disturbance  in  fluid flows is different from  those of solid  mechanics. 
The  stability  of  a  laminar  flow  might  be  much  different  from  the  mechanical  analogue  of  a 
simple  linear  oscillator.  In  fluid  flow,  there  is  interaction  between  the  base  flow  and  the 
disturbance  flow.  The  process  of  linearity  of  disturbance  is  over-simplified  the  problem.  The 
solution of linear eigenvalue is correct in mathematics for the given equation, but it is not true in 
physics;    even  although  linear  analysis  could  give  agreement  result  with  experiment  in  some 
cases  (for  example,  Tollmien-Schlichting  waves  in  boundary  layer  and  Taylor-Couette  flow 
between rotating cylinders). This is because the starting equations do not represent the physics 
of the problem. In the solution of the disturbance equation, only the interaction of the base flow 
and the disturbance flow is considered, results consistent with the physics could be obtained.

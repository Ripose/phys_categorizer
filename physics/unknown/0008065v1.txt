Abstract

 Experimental  and  theoretical  activities  are  underway
at CERN [1] with the aim of examining the feasibility of
a  very-high-flux  neutrino  source  (≈1021  neutrinos/year).
In the present scheme, a high-power proton beam (some
4 MW) bombards a target where pions are produced. The
pions are collected and decay to muons under controlled
optical condition. The muons are cooled and accelerated
to a final energy of 50 GeV before being injected into a
decay  ring  where 
they  decay  under  well-defined
conditions of energy and emittance.

 We  present  the  most  challenging  parts  of  the  whole
scenario,  the  muon  capture,  the  ionisation-cooling  and
the  first  stage  of  the  muon  acceleration.  Different
schemes, their performance and the technical challenges
are compared.

1  INTRODUCTION

 A next generation neutrino source  (Neutrino  Factory)
should  have  the  following  advantages  with  respect  to
today's sources: a higher flux (1021 neutrinos/year vs. the
present  1011),  a  higher  energy  (50  GeV  vs.  the  present
20 GeV for the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso project)
and the possibility to control the flavour of the neutrino
beam.  A  beam  with  the  aforementioned  characteristics
can  be  obtained  by  bombarding  a  target  with  high-
energy  protons,  collecting  the  produced  pions  and
allowing  them  to  decay  in  a  controlled  environment
before  accelerating  the  muons  to  the  required  50  GeV.
The  muons  decaying  in  a  storage  ring,  whose  straight
sections are pointed towards the detectors,  will  produce
neutrinos with the desired characteristics. The design of
the pion collection system and the first stage of the muon
acceleration (front-end) are extremely challenging due to
the large emittances involved.

2  FRONT-END DESIGN

 To meet the requirements of a Neutrino Factory,  1020

of 1.5 cm⋅rad and a longitudinal emittance of 0.06 eV⋅s

 In  the  CERN  reference  scheme,  a  proton  driver  [2]
would be  built  to  deliver  4  MW  of  2.2  GeV  protons  in
bursts of 3.3 µs repeated at 75 Hz, i.e. 1023 protons/year
(notice  that  through  this  paper  an  operational  year  is
assumed to consist of 107 seconds).

the  divergence  200  mrad  and  the  kinetic  energy  ranges
from  0.05  to  1  GeV.  The  peak  of  the  production  is
around  0.1  GeV  kinetic  energy,  and  75%  of  the  pions
have energies between 0.050 and 0.3 GeV. For the case
presented  in  Fig.  1,  0.017  π+  are  produced  for  each
2.2 GeV proton on a thin (26 mm) mercury target. These
data are linearly extrapolated to a 300 mm target.

 Insufficient  pions 
the  energy-spread
acceptance of any conventional accelerator. A reduction
of energy spread  by  phase  rotation  can  be  envisaged  in
three possible ways:

•  Apply  it  to  the  pions  just  after  the  target  :  this
allows  the  full  benefit  of  the  defined  time
structure  of  the  pions,  but  it  implies  the  use  of
high-gradient rf  cavities  in  a  high  radiation  area.
Further  complications  arise  due  to  the  decay  of
pions in an rf field.

•  Allow the pions to decay (drift of tens of meters)
before  they  enter  an  rf  cavity  with  moderate
gradients.

•  Allow the pions to decay and let the muons  drift
for some hundreds of meters in order to build up a
strong  correlation  between  time  and  energy  and
then  match  the  energy  spread  with  a  quasi-dc
device (e.g. an induction linac).

The  two  latter  approaches  [3,4]  will  be  described  in
detail in the next sections.

 2.1  The rf approach to phase rotation

 The parameters are presented in Table1.
 The  pions  decay  in  a  30  m  long  channel  and  are
focused  by  a  1.8  T  solenoid.  At  the  end  of  the  decay
channel, the beam enters a series of 44 MHz cavities and
the energy spread of the particles with kinetic energy in
the  range  100-300  MeV  is  reduced  by  a  factor  two.  A
first cooling stage, employing the same rf cavities and 24
cm  long  H2  absorbers,  reduces  the  transverse  emittance
in each plane by a factor 1.4 while keeping the average
energy constant. After the first cooling stage, the beam is
accelerated to an average energy of 300 MeV. The beam
phase extent, as well as the reduced physical dimensions
of the beam, allows the continuation of the cooling with
 

88 MHz cavities. 40 cm long absorbers are used in  this
section. At the end of cooling, the emittance is reduced
by  a  factor  4  in  each  transverse  plane.  The  system  is
continued at 88 MHz, and 176 MHz until the energy of 2
GeV  -suitable  for  injection  in  a  Recirculating  Linac
Accelerator  (RLA)-  is  reached.  The  system  works  also
with 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 200 MHz.
 2.2  The induction linac (IL) approach

The parameters are presented in Table 2.
The  pions  are  transported  through  a  tapered  solenoid
of  initial  field  of  20  T,  as  favoured  by  the  “Neutrino
Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration” [5]. At 1.46 T
the solenoid is continued for a distance of 200 m where
the  pion 
the  strong
momentum and time correlation is formed.

to  muon  decay  occurs,  and 

A  high  performance  induction  linac  is  then  used  to
correct  the  energy  spread  of  the  beam.  The  induction
linac  is  formed  of  25 cm  cells  pulsed  with  a  maximum
voltage  of  500 kV.  The  electrostatic  field  distribution
was  calculated  using  POISSON.  A  solenoid  is  placed
inside  each  of  the  cells,  producing  an  on-axis  field  of
1.46 T, rising to 1.9 T near the outer limits of the beam
chamber, for which a large aperture of 60 cm is required.
The linac produces an average gradient of 2 MV/m for a
distance of 50 m. The correction affects the muons with
kinetic  energies  between  120  and  310  MeV  and  results
in  a  330 ns  long  macro  bunch.  To  obtain  a  bunched
beam  for  cooling,  a  series  of  176 MHz  cavities  are
employed over a distance of 17 m followed by a further
17  m  of  drift  space.  The  βλ/2  cavities  are  operated  at
2  MV/m  with  0.5 m  solenoids  between  them,  again
providing an average on-axis field of 1.46 T. A  cooling
section  follows  in  which  the  beam  could  be  reduced  in
transverse emittance by a factor 3.

 2.3  Particle budget

 The  particle  budget  for  the  two  solutions  studied  is
shown in Fig. 2. The number of muons delivered to the
RLA is comparable for  the  two  schemes  and,  assuming
the  CERN  proton  driver  and  target,  the  number  of
muons/year reaches 1021 in both.

 For the IL solution the improvement is  needed  in  the
bunching  section  before  the  cooling  (50%  efficiency  at
the moment).

 In Fig. 3 the emittance evolution along the rf front end
can be followed. An emittance increase by a factor 1.5 is
generated  during  the  decay.  No  effort  has  yet  been
dedicated to limiting this growth.

 2.4   Comparison of the two approaches

 Both  the  rf  and  IL  approach  deliver  a  sufficient
number  of  neutrinos.  The  difference  between  them  lies
in  the  feasibility  of  the  main  components  and  on  the
constraints imposed on the proton driver. The Induction
Linac parameters are very demanding and the limitation
in  the  number  of  bunches/burst  from  the  proton  driver
(12) would result in very high space-charge forces in the
compressor ring. Conversely, the rf solution could accept
any  number  of  bunches  from  the  accumulator  (up  to  a
max of 140). Preliminary calculations on a 44 MHz and
a 88 MHz cavity show that an average power of 0.06 and
0.032 MW/cavity would suffice to provide the necessary
field.  The  total  average  power  (15  MW  for  the  whole
phase 
is  also
considerably  less  than  that  needed  for  the  IL  alone  (75
MW,  scaling  from  [5];  although  this  can  be  reduced  to
37 MW with a better core material).

 3  CONCLUSIONS

 Two possible schemes for the front-end of a  neutrino
factory  have  been  explored  at  CERN.  Both  of  them
deliver the required  number  of  neutrinos.  The  technical
challenges,  the  CERN  rf  expertise  [6]  and  the  better
match to the CERN proton driver have led to the choice
of the rf scheme as the CERN reference scenario.

 In Fig. 2 we can identify the bottlenecks and the possible
improvements  to  the  designs.  In  the  rf  solution,  the
transition  between  phase  rotation  and  the  first  stage  of
cooling should be  smoothed  in  order  to  limit  the  losses
(longitudinal losses, particles falling outside the bucket):
interlacing  of  the  two  sections  as  well  as  the  use  of
higher harmonics will be studied in the  future.  Besides,
the  result  of  rf  tests  should  give  a  guideline  for  the
maximum allowable gradient.

Abstract

The probabilistic description of ﬁnite classical systems often leads to linear kinetic equations. A

set of physically motivated mathematical requirements is accordingly formulated. We show that it

necessarily implies that solutions of such a kinetic equation in the Heisenberg representation, deﬁne

Markov semigroups on the space of observables. Moreover, a general H-theorem for the adjoint of such

semigroups is formulated and proved provided that at least locally, an invariant measure exists. Under a

certain continuity assumption, the Markov semigroup property is suﬃcient for a linear kinetic equation

to be a second order diﬀerential equation with nonegative-deﬁnite leading coeﬃcient. Conversely it is

shown that such equations deﬁne Markov semigroups satisfying an H-theorem, provided there exists

a nonnegative equilibrium solution for their formal adjoint, vanishing at inﬁnity.

1. INTRODUCTION

In a probabilistic description of classical systems with a ﬁnite number of degrees of

freedom, one often encounters linear, autonomous, evolution equations of the form

∂f
∂t

= ZSf.

(1.1)

Such equations, which henceforth, and for the sake of brevity, will be called kinetic
equations, are assumed to determine the time evolution of the statistical state of the

system. In this context, states are taken to be probability densities on the phase space,

(1.3)

the manifold of the dynamical variables characterizing the system, while observables
A are simply (suﬃciently well-behaved, real) phase-space functions. Furthermore, ex-
pectation values are obtained via some bilinear form w on the cartesian product of the

spaces of states and observables

provided they remain ﬁnite for all observables, i.e.
observables is considered, an equation of the form

|w| < +∞.

If the evolution of

hAif ≡ w(f, A),

∂A
∂t

= ZOA,

should hold, with ZO a formal adjoint in the sense that

w(f, ZOA) = w(ZSf, A)

Here it is being assumed that w separates the states and observables (equivalently: w

is nondegenerate) and

w(ft, A) = w(f, At)

i.e. the two pictures are essentially equivalent. Typical examples are well known kinetic
equations, like those of Kramers, Fokker-Planck or the (linear) Boltzmann and Landau
equations1−3. Such equations result by applying some more or less systematic approx-
imation scheme based on a perturbation analysis of the exact microscopic dynamics
of the system under consideration3,4, or by applying stochastic methods2,5, based on
assumptions concerning the behaviour of a large number of microscopic events charac-
terizing the system. For classical open systems weakly interacting with large equilibrium
baths, kinetic equations have been derived6,7 using techniques similar to those devel-
opped for quantum systems8. On the other hand, some ‘markovianization’ procedures
imposed on the exact dynamics may lead to inconsistent equations9. Note that in such
derivations, expansions with respect to some appropriate parameter are used, implying
that ZS or ZO are diﬀerential operators of some order, depending on the approximation.
However in the physics litterature, not suﬃcient attention has been given to a general
presentation of the structure and properties of such classical (“Markovian”) kinetic
equations, independently of the method used to derive them10. In our opinion this seems
necessary at least for two reasons :

2

(a) as already mentioned, proposed perturbation schemes may lead to results incom-
patible with a probabilistic interpretation, particularly, violation of positivity of the
states9
(b) derivations based on the theory of stochastic processes a priori impose conditions
on the physical characteristics of the systems studied (e.g. postulate a master evolution

equation for the states, like the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, on which approxima-
tions are subsequently made).

Instead, our aim in this paper is to provide a mathematically rigorous and physically
adequate framework for the study of such kinetic equations, and examine certain of
the properties of their solutions, formally determined by one parameter semigroups
Vt = eZS t. Speciﬁcally, we give minimal conditions under which

(1) Eq. (1.1) does indeed deﬁne rigorously a semigroup of solutions capable of a prob-

abilistic interpretation, particularly preserving positivity,

(2) it is possible to characterize ZS and ZO and explicit their general form if they are

diﬀerential operators,

proved.

(3) an H-theorem for arbitrary continuous convex functionals of the state can be

In this way, the outline of the formal framework for a probabilistic description of ﬁnite

classical systems given at the beginning of this section, is made precise and kinetic
equations like (1.1), (1.1′) become in principle mathematically and physically mean-
ingful. Our approach is similar to that followed in deﬁning dynamical semigroups for
quantum systems11. To this end, we notice that (1.2) is essentially a duality relation,
suggesting that states are linear functionals deﬁned on observables. Then the interpre-

tation of states as probability densities in (1.1) implies that observables are bounded
functions in phase-space. Then, in view of (1.2), ﬁnite expectation values for all observ-

ables naturally leads to an extension of the state-space beyond probability densities,
so that all linear functionals deﬁned on bounded functions are included. In section 2,

these qualitative remarks are precisely formulated, thus establishing a suﬃciently wide
mathematical framework for the derivation of rigorous results. In particular it will be
seen that kinetic equations like (1.1′) should necessarily deﬁne a Markov semigroup of
solutions on the (Banach) space of observables. In section 3 we collect basic theorems
concerning the generator of a Markov semigroup. Some proofs are presented, mainly

3

because they are partly used as intermediate steps toward other results so that the
paper is suﬃciently self-contained. In section 4 we show rigorously that the only diﬀer-
ential operators that are candidates as generators of Markov semigroups, are at most

of the 2nd order, namely (degenerate in general) elliptic operators (Lemma 4.1). We
further supply a complete proof of the fact that under a certain continuity assumption,

well-known in the theory of stochastic processes, eq(4.1), the generator of a Markov
semigroup is indeed a diﬀerential operator (theorem (4.1)). The converse problem is

considered in section 5, where we show that under mild regularity conditions, in general
degenerate elliptic operators generate Markov semigroups globally deﬁned on the space
of observables. This generalizes classical results on local solutions of nondegenerate

elliptic equations. Finally in section 6, a general H-theorem for arbitrary continuous
functionals on the state-space is formulated and proved for any (and not only for a

diﬀusion type) Markov semigroup, under the assumption that an invariant measure ex-
ists, which for a diﬀusion-type semigroup is implied by the existence of an equilibrium
solution ρ0 of (1.1) (theorem 6.1). It should be emphasized at this point that ρ0 need
not be a probability density, i.e. integrable on the whole phase-space of the system (e.g.

for particle systems, in position as well as in velocity space). This is a global formu-
lation of the H-theorem (corollary (6.1)) to be contrasted to the local one given as an
entropy continuity equation, and usually obtained in cases the kinetic equation for the

states has a nonintegrable stationary solution. Moreover, it will become apparent that
the existence of such a solution (satisﬁed by the formalism of Refs.6, 7) implies that

the Markov semigroup property (speciﬁcally, positivity conservation) is (essentially)
equivalent to the existence of H-functions.

2. MATHEMATICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND THEIR

PHYSICAL MOTIVATION: MARKOV SEMIGROUPS

As already mentioned, inherent to kinetic equations like (1.1) is a probabilistic interpre-
tation. Motivated by the preceding qualitative discussion, we introduce a minimal set of

assumptions to ﬁx an appropriate mathematical framework for states and observables
of a ﬁnite classical system and for their time evolution given by kinetic equations like
(1.1), (1.1′). Though the interpretation of states is better suited to supply the physical
motivation for such assumptions, it is mathematically more convenient to work with
observables. This is suggested by theorem 2.1 below and will become more evident in

4

sections 3-5. The results thus obtained will enable us to return to the state space when
formulating and proving the H-theorem in the last section.

We consider admissible observable quantities A as (real) bounded continuous func-

tions on the phase space X, that remain ﬁnite at inﬁnity, X being a diﬀerentiable
manifold (e.g. the phase-space of a Hamiltonian system). It is convenient to embed

them in a complex linear space (and extend w in (1.2) to a sesquilinear form). Thus
we introduce

Assumption (A1) : The phase-space X of a system is a diﬀerentiable manifold, and
observables belong to C(X∞, C), the space of all continuous complex valued functions
having a ﬁnite limit at inﬁnity.

Here, X∞ is X together with the inﬁnite point (more precisely, the one-point com-
pactiﬁcation of X). Then continuous functions A, having a ﬁnite limit at inﬁnity (in
particular constant functions)12 can be identiﬁed with continuous functions on X∞, by
deﬁning A(∞) to be this ﬁnite limit. Thus observables belong to C(X∞, C) which is a
Banach space with norm ||A|| = supx∈X∞|A(x)|.

In section 1, it has been suggested that states l are linear functionals on the space
of observables, their values l(A) giving expectations. Then, their probabilistic interpre-

tation requires them to be positive, i.e. l(A) ≥ 0 for A ≥ 0, since expectation values
of nonegative random variables are nonegative (notice that l is real in this case). Then
l is bounded with bound ||l|| = l(1) 13, hence l is continuous on C(X∞, C) that is
l ∈ C ∗(X∞, C) where S∗ is the Banach dual of a normed space S. The above comments
are summarized in

Assumption (A2) : If C(X∞, C) contains the observables A, then states l are positive
linear functionals on it and expectation values are given by l(A).

We remark here, that states thus introduced, extend the class of states deﬁned by
probability densities, this extended class being characterized as probability measures
by the Riesz-Markov theorem below 13,14.

Theorem 2.1 (i) For every positive ℓ ∈ C ∗(X∞, C) there exists a unique positive
(regular) Borel measure µ such that

ℓ(A) =

A(x)dµ(x) ,

kℓk = ℓ(1) = µ(X∞)

(2.1)

Z

(ii) More generally, if ℓ ∈ C ∗(X∞, C), there exists a unique complex Borel measure µ
such that (2.1) holds and kℓk = |µ|(X∞), where |µ| is the total variation of µ 14.

5

Remarks: In the present work all measures are regular Borel measures. The theorem is
valid if C(X∞, C) is replaced by C0(X, C) or Cc(X, C), the spaces of functions vanishing
at inﬁnity or having compact support respectively. Finally, we notice that unbounded

phase space functions such as polynomials, have been excluded from observables, since
for such functions it is impossible to have ﬁnite expectation values for all states.

Having established states and observables as elements of dual Banach spaces, we

introduce for their time evolution (1.1), (1.1′)

Assumption (A3): Equation (1.1′) has a well-posed initial-value problem, that is: for
given initial data, the solution is unique for t > 0, it depends continuously on the initial
data (small changes in the initial data imply small changes in the solution, in the sense

of the Banach space norm) and expectations are continuous in t.

Notice that A3, proposition 2.2 below and A2 imply that A3 holds for (1.1) as well and
by the linearity of (1.1′) nonuniqueness for one initial condition implies nonuniqueness
for all. It is well known that A3 implies

Proposition 2.1 If (1.1′) is linear, autonomous and has a well-posed initial value
problem on some set U of the Banach space of observables, then its solutions A(t)
with initial conditions A, uniquely deﬁne a s-continuous one-parameter semigroup of
operators TtA ≡ A(t) on the Banach subspace B ≡ ¯U (from now on the preﬁx s or w
means strong or weak respectively and ¯U is the s-closure of U).

Here we used that continuity of expectation values imply w-continuity of Tt for t = 0,
which is equivalent to its s-continuity for t ≥ 0 15 and

Deﬁnition 2.1 A (one-parameter s-continuous) semigroup (of operators) on a Banach
space B, is a family of bounded linear operators { Tt, t ≥ 0 }, such that:

(i) Tt+s = TtTs, (ii) s–limt→t0 TtA = Tt0A

Its generator Z is deﬁned by

Banach subspace B. Deﬁne Z by (2.2) (D(Z) 6= ∅). Then
(a) on B, Tt is uniquely deﬁned by Z and is s-continuous for t ≥ 0; B is Tt-invariant,

The adjoint semigroup T ∗

is everywhere deﬁned on B∗ by (T ∗

ilarly since Z is densely deﬁned on B, its adjoint Z ∗ is deﬁned for all ℓ ∈ B∗ for which
A → ℓ(ZA) is bounded, as the unique bounded extension of this functional to B. Thus
(Z ∗ℓ)(A) = ℓ(ZA) ∀A ∈ D(Z). Now, unless B is a reﬂexive Banach space neither T ∗
t
is s-continuous on B∗ nor Z ∗ is its generator. Therefore (1.1′), (1.1) are not simply
adjoint equations. However we have 17

Proposition 2.2 Let Tt be a s-continuous semigroup on the Banach space B, with
generator Z. Then its adjoint T ∗
is s-continuous on a (presumably proper) Banach
t
subspace of B∗, uniquely determined on B∗ by its generator however, and for which Z ∗
is an extension.

Thus going back to (1.1), (1.1′), either ZS or Z ∗
O can be taken as the generator in the
evolution equation for the states without any inconsistency. In connection with A2 we
require conservation of positivity and of normalization of the states for all times, that
are indispensable for their probabilistic interpretation

Assumption (A4): (a) For t > 0, ℓ positive implies T ∗

t ) is a contraction semigroup

In summary, assumptions A1-A4, suﬃciently well justiﬁed upon physical and math-
ematical considerations, imply that linear autonomous kinetic equations conserving
the probabilistic interpretation of states, necessarily generate Markov semigroups on
C(X∞, C), the space of observables, i.e. a positivity and normalization preserving s-
continuous semigroup (cf.(2.6)). In the next two sections their properties are considered

(proof of their 1-1 correspondence with time-homogeneous Markov processes is outlined
in Appendix 1).

3. GENERAL RESULTS ON THE GENERATOR

OF A MARKOV SEMIGROUP

Here we summarize results on the generator of a Markov semigroup. Though we follow
mainly Ref.17, some proofs are slightly modiﬁed so that a coherent presentation results.
The Hille-Yosida theorem is in our case 15,17

Proposition 3.1 A closed, densely deﬁned operator Z on a (presumably complex)
Banach space B is the generator of a s-continuous contraction semigroup of operators
iﬀ its resolvent Rλ = (λ − Z)−1 is an everywhere deﬁned bounded operator for λ > 0
and

kRλk ≤ 1/λ,

λ > 0

(3.1)

Remark: The resolvent set of Z, i.e. those z ∈ C such that Rz is everywhere deﬁned,
contains IR+, and since Z is closed, it is an open set, in particular µ belongs there for
|µ − λ| ≤ 1
kRλk. Rλ is a closed (hence bounded, by the closed-graph theorem) operator
on B.

Contractivity of a semigroup is related to the dissipativity of its generator: by the
Hahn-Banach theorem, in a normed space B and for every A ∈ B there exists an (in
general nonunique) ℓ ∈ B∗ such that15

kℓk = 1 , ℓ(A) = kAk equivalently kℓk = kAk

ℓ(A) = kAk2

(3.2)

Thus we give:

8

Deﬁnition 3.1 An operator Z on a normed space B is dissipative if and only if for
every (ℓ, A) ∈ B∗ × B satisfying (3.2) (Re denoting the real part)

Re ℓ(ZA) ≤ 0

(3.3)

Remark: For a Hilbert space with scalar product h, i, (3.3) is equivalent to Re hA, ZAi ≤
0, hence kTtAk2 decreases monotonically in time (cf.(2.4)). This is closely related to an
H-theorem for the adjoint equation (section 6).

Proposition 3.2 If Z is a densely deﬁned closed operator on a Banach space B, the
following are equivalent:

(a) Z generates a s-continuous contraction semigroup on B.
(b) (i) Range(λ − Z) = B ∀λ > 0, (ii) Z is dissipative
(c) (i) ∃λ > 0 : Range(λ − Z) = B, (ii) ∀A ∈ B ∃ℓ ∈ B∗ so that (3.2), (3.3) hold.

Proof: (a)⇒(b): Condition (b,i) is part of proposition 3.1 Take ℓ, A as in (3.2). Then

by the continuity of ℓ and (3.2)

Re ℓ(ZA) = Re lim

ℓ(TtA) − kAk

(b)⇒(c) trivial
(c)⇒(a) for A ∈ D(Z) take ℓ as in (3.2). Then for any µ > 0

k(µ − Z)(A)k ≥ |ℓ((µ − Z)A)| = |µkA| − ℓ(ZA)| ≥ µkA|

hence µ − Z is 1-1 in its range, and if this is equal to B, then µ is in the resolvent set
of Z and kRµk ≤ 1
kRλk ≥ λ. By the remark in proposition 3.1, every
µ ∈ (0, 3λ

Q.E.D.

kRλk) is in the resolvent set of Z. By induction all µ ∈ (0, ( 3

1

Modifying slightly the proof (c)⇒(a) above we obtain 17

Corollary 3.1 If Z is a densely deﬁned closable operator on the Banach space B with

Range(λ − Z) dense in B for some λ > 0 and condition (c,ii) of proposition 3.2 holds,
then its closure ˜Z generates a s-continuous semigroup on B.

Remark: From (2.10-11) conservation of positivity and normalization on C(X∞, C),
imply dissipativity. For a partial converse we have

Proposition 3.3 A s-continuous contraction semigroup Tt of operators on C(X∞, C)
with generator Z, is positivity-preserving if (ZA)∗ = ZA∗, and

if A(x0) ≥ A(x) ∀x ∈ X∞ then ZA(x0) ≤ 0

(3.4)

9

Proof: By proposition 3.1, every λ > 0 is in the resolvent set of Z and since D(Rλ) =
C(X∞, C), we shall show that (λ−Z)A ≥ 0 ⇒ A ≥ 0. Suppose A takes negative values
on X∞, with an absolute minimum A(x0). By (3.4) (λ − Z)A(x0) < 0 for any λ > 0 and
t ≡ e−λteλ2Rλt is
by proposition 3.1, for any λ > 0 kλ(λRλ−I)k≤2λ ∀λ > 0. Therefore T λ
a well-deﬁned, positivity-preserving s-continuous semigroup and λ(λRλ − I) = λZRλ.
From this follows that s–limλ→+∞ λ(λRλ − I)A = ZA for A ∈ D(Z), which implies
s–limλ→+∞ T λ
t = TtA uniformly in t on bounded intervals17. Hence TtA ≥ 0 for A ≥ 0
Q.E.D.

Remark: If 1 ∈ D(Z), (3.4) implies Z(1) = 0, hence Tt1 = 1.

Proposition 3.2 and theorem A.1.1 give the characterization of the generator of a Markov

semigroup by (see Ref.34, section 7.7 for a slightly diﬀerent formulation)

Theorem 3.1 Let Z be a densely deﬁned closed operator on C(X∞, C). Then the
following are equivalent:
(a) Z generates a Markov semigroup Tt

(b) (i) 1 ∈ D(Z),

(ii) ∃λ > 0 : Range(λ − Z) = C(X∞, C),
(iii) (ZA)∗ = ZA∗ ∀A ∈ D(Z),
(iv) (3.4) holds.

Proof: (a) ⇒ (b). (i) follows from (2.6), (ii) from proposition 3.1 since Tt is a contrac-
tion semigroup. By theorem A.1.1 and (A.1.2) both (iii), (iv) are evident.
(b) ⇒ (a). Let A ∈ D(Z). Since X∞ is compact, |A| continuous, kAk = |A(x0)| for
some x0 ∈ X∞. Without loss of generality let A(x0) > 0 and δx0 be the δ-function at
x0, which is a positive linear functional on C(X∞, C), hence kδx0k = δx0(1) = 1. Then
kAk = A(x0) = δx0(A) ≥ A(x) ∀x ∈ X∞, so that by (3.4) δx0(ZA) = ZA(x0) ≤ 0.
Hence by (ii) and proposition 3.2, Z generates a contraction semigroup, which by (ii),
(iii) and proposition 3.3 is positivity-preserving. Since D(Z) ∋ 1, Tt1 = 1 by the remark
Q.E.D.
to proposition 3.3.

Remark: Proposition 3.3 and theorem 3.1 show that (3.4) is the crucial condition
relating dissipativity with conservation of positivity (see end of section 4 and section 6).

4. DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS GENERATING
MARKOV SEMIGROUPS

In view of the last remark we explicit the form of the generator of a Markov semigroup

that is a diﬀerential operator, since kinetic equations are often given by such operators.
We ﬁrst prove18,19
Lemma 4.1 Let Z be a diﬀerential operator of order k, deﬁned on C k(IRn, IR) and
suppose that for any f ∈ D(Z), if f (~x0) ≥ f (~x) ∀~x ∈ IRn then Zf (~x0) ≤ 0. Then Z is
at most a 2nd order diﬀerential operator with nonegative-deﬁnite 2nd order coeﬃcient.

Proof: (i) Let n = 1. By the remark to proposition 3.3, Z has no zeroth order term.
Suppose Z has the form

Z = c1(x)

g(x) = −ǫ(x − x0)2 + a(x − x0)k,

ǫ > 0, a∈IR

Clearly g has a local maximum zero at x0. There is a neighborhood N(x0) with compact
closure, in which g(x) ≤ g(x0) = 0. Let ˜f(x) be a C k-function with compact support,
˜f (x) ≤ 0 on IR − N(x0) having the same partial derivatives with g up to order k, on
the boundary of N(x0). Then

f (x) =

, x ∈ IR − N(x0)

is a C k-function with f (x) ≤ f (x0) = 0 ∀x ∈ IR and Zf (x0) = −2ǫc2(x0) + k!ack(x0).
Since k > 2, appropriate choice of a, makes it positive, unless ck(x0) = 0.
By a similar argument c2(x) ≥ 0 ∀x ∈ IR (for any x0 ∈ IR take g(x) = −ǫ(x − x0)2, ǫ >
0).
(ii) For n > 1 let Z contain a term of the form c(~x)∂a1

Q.E.D.

Remarks:
(a) Eq(4.1) implies the existence of the ﬁrst two moments of p(t, ~x, ·) and Lemma 4.1
that all higher moments vanish21. Notice that in the theory of stochastic processes,
(4.2) is usually derived by assuming (4.1) and the existence of the ﬁrst two moments of
p, from which the vanishing of higher moments follows5. Notice also that (4.1) implies
uniform stochastic continuity of p(t, ~x, N), (A.1.3).

(b) For arbitrary diﬀerentiable manifolds, theorem 4.2 holds, since only local compact-
ness of IRn and Taylor’s theorem are used.
(c) The theorem is true if IRn, IRn

Theorem 4.1 shows that (4.1) is a rather strong condition. It should be desirable to

have a characterization of the generator of a Markov semigroup relaxing (4.1), namely
operators satisfying (3.4)22. In this connection the following remarks are relevant:
it
can be shown that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a linear operator acting on
C 2- functions and for which Z(1) = 0, is a 2nd order diﬀerential operator, is that for
any A in its domain and x0 such that A(x0) = 0, it follows that Z(A3)(x0) = 0 23. On
the other hand, (3.4) implies that for all nonpositive functions Z(A3)(x0) ≤ 0 whenever
A(x0) = 0. Therefore in theorem 4.1 the equality-sign case is characterized. To put it
diﬀerently : generators of Markov semigroups that are not only diﬀerential operators,
are characterized by the condition that there exist nonpositive functions A for which

Z(A3)(x0) < 0 when A(x0) = 0

Thus the problem reduces to the characterization of such operators.

5. DEGENERATE ELLIPTIC EQUATIONS AND MARKOV
SEMIGROUPS

In the previous section we have shown that the generator of a Markov semigroup is a
2nd order diﬀerential operator if it is deﬁned for C 2-functions and satisﬁes (4.1). On
the other hand, as mentioned in section 1, various approaches to kinetic theory that
starting from microscopic classical dynamics and imposing more or less systematic ap-

proximation schemes, lead to linear autonomous kinetic equations for particular classes
of systems that are partial diﬀerential equations (see e.g. the approaches based on it-

eration schemes applied to the so-called generalized master equation of one or another
form2−4). Therefore they are incompatible with A1 − A4 unless they are at most of the
2nd order with nonegative-deﬁnite leading coeﬃcient.

Using the results of section 4 we shall show that under quite general conditions, the
converse is true, namely an operator of the form (4.2) generates a Markov semigroup

on observables globally deﬁned on the phase space. Moreover conservation of positivity
is essentially equivalent to the existence of an H-theorem for the adjoint semigroup.
This is the subject of the next section. We consider IRn, but our results are applicable
to any diﬀerentiable manifold, without essential modiﬁcations, since they depend on
local diﬀerentiability properties of function of IRn and its local compactness.

Proposition 5.1 holds if IRn, IRn

∞ are replaced by U, ¯U respectively for any relatively
R
compact open U ⊆ IRn. Obviously (5.4′) has to be modiﬁed. Therefore, let Z ¯U be the
restriction of Z in (5.3) on ¯U for any relatively compact open U ⊆ IRn, and ˜Z ¯U its
closure, easily seen to be the restriction of ˜Z on ¯U . Then we have:
Proposition 5.2 Suppose that for Z in (5.3), aij, bi are in C 2(IRn, IR), aij is a nonegative
- deﬁnite matrix and ∂k∂ℓaij are H¨older continuous for some positive exponent24. Then
there is a (topological) base of relatively compact (open) sets {Ua} and a λ > 0 such
that for each Ua Range(λ − ˜Za) = C( ¯Ua, C), where Za ≡ Z ¯Ua.

The proof25 uses the generalization of classical results concerning the solution of
elliptic equations with strictly positive-deﬁnite 2nd order coeﬃcient, bounded from
below away from zero26, at the expense of requiring the coeﬃcients to be C 2-functions27.
Relaxing the restriction of strict positivity of (aij) is important for kinetic theory, given
that it is violated by important kinetic equations (e.g. the (linear) Landau equation
either in phase-space or velocity space, or model equations like Kramers equation2,6,7),
whereas regularity conditions are not so essential, since suﬃcient diﬀerentiability is

often implicitly required.

In the above notation, let f ∈ C(IRn, C) and fa ≡ f | ¯Ua. Then there exists a unique
ua ∈ D( ˜Za) with (λ − ˜Za)ua = fa, hence Range(λ − Za) = C( ¯Ua, C). Proceeding
as in the proof of theorem 3.1, condition (cii) of proposition 3.2 is equivalent to the
nonegative-deﬁniteness of aij in (5.3). By Corollary 3.1, ˜Za is the (dissipative) generator
of a s-continuous contraction semigroup on C( ¯Ua, C). Since ( ˜Zf )
= ˜Zf ∗, and 1 ∈
D(Za), by theorem 4.1 ˜Za uniquely deﬁnes a Markov semigroup on C( ¯Ua, C). Restricting
it on C(Ua, C), T a

By the uniqueness of T a

open, Ttf is continuous. Then for f ∈ Cc(IRn, C), its support can be covered by a ﬁnite

subset of {Ua}, U1, · · · , Un say, and support(Ttf ) ⊆ support(f ), since on each Ua, Tt
a Markov semigroup. Therefore

|Ttf (~x)| ≤ max{kTt

kf k, k = 1, 2, · · · , n} ≤ kf k

hence Tt is bounded. By the remark to theorem 2.1, any ℓ in (Cc(IRn, C))∗ is biuniquely

Thus Tt is w-continuous at t = 0, hence s-continuous for all t > 0. Therefore Tt is
uniquely extended to C0(IRn, C) since Cc(IRn, C) is dense there14, preserving the above
properties (this extension is also denoted by Tt). As in the proof of theorem A.1.1, we
show that Tt satisﬁes (A.2.1) for some probability measure p(t, ~x, ·) on IRn, regularly
extended on IRn
∞ by putting p(t, ~x, {∞}) = 0. Thus Tt is a Markov semigroup on
C(IRn
∞, C) with generator locally given by the closure of Z in (5.3). This completes the
proof of
Theorem 5.1 Z in (5.3) is a densely deﬁned, closable operator on C(IRn
∞, C). Its closure
˜Z generates a Markov semigroup Tt on C(IRn
∞, C) if (aij) is a nonegative-deﬁnite matrix
function, aij, bi are in C 2(IRn, IR) and ∂k∂ℓaij are H¨older continuous for some exponent
in (0,1).

Remark: Theorem 5.1 is valid without essential modiﬁcations on any diﬀerentiable
manifold, in particular for a relatively compact open subset of IRn
∞ (see the remark
preceding proposition 5.2).

6. THE H-THEOREM AND CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this section we consider arbitrary Markov semigroups on C(IRn

∞, C), the generator
of which is not necessarily a diﬀerential operator. We shall prove that the adjoint

semigroup giving the evolution of states, satisﬁes a general H-theorem. Working with
the adjoint semigroup, the proof turns out to be simpler and the theorem more general
than that obtained directly from the kinetic equation. We introduce the measure ˜µ
deﬁned by (5.4′′). Then any φ ∈ C(IRn
∞) !) deﬁnes a bounded linear
functional ℓφ on C(IRn

The essential condition for the H-theorem is (6.4)32. To clarify its meaning we go back
to diﬀusion-type Markov semigroups and notice that if aij, bi∈D(Z), use of (5.4), (5.6),
(5.7), (6.1) implies that under the assumptions of theorem 5.1 and for any f ∈ D(Z)

Since D(Z) is dense, ( ˜Z)∗ = Z ∗, hence ℓφ ∈ D(( ˜Z)∗). Finally (6.8) can be applied
to φ = 1 and therefore Z †ρ0 = 0 is equivalent to ˜µ being an invariant measure of the
Markov process corresponding to Tt. But it is easily seen that T ∗
t ℓφ is s-continuous,
hence using theorem 2.1, equation (2.4), we complete the proof of

Q.E.D.

Remark: In the formalism of Refs. 6, 7 Hi in (5.7) is zero (equation (2.19) of Ref.7 and
the discussion following it). By (5.7), (6.9), (5, 4′) this implies (6.10). The essential
content of this proposition is that the existence of an invariant measure ˜µ, hence of an
H-theorem, is supplied by the existence of an equilibrium distribution satisfying (5.4).

Physically speaking, this may be interpreted as the stationarity of a Maxwell-Boltzmann
(MB) distribution for the formal adjoint equation (6.12), if H in (5.4′) is nonegative.

At this point however it should be noticed that although the existence of a stationary

solution of (6.12) is not a strong requirement, on the contrary, it is a physically desirable
feature of classical kinetic equations, its Lebesgue integrability (see (5.4)), is a constraint

violated by quite simple evolution equations and for which a diﬀerential form of an H-
theorem is nevertheless easily proved (cf. (6.14) below and the discussion following it).

Think for instance of the diﬀusion equation, even with variable coeﬃcients, for which
ρ0(~x) = 1 (see also appendix 2). Therefore, one is tempted to relax (5.4) and keep only
the stationarity of ρ0. Then, a careful reconsideration of the proofs of theorem 6.1 and
proposition 6.1 shows that minor modiﬁcations in their hypotheses ensure their validity
in this case as well. This is the content of

Corollary 6.1 With the notation of theorem 6.1 and proposition 6.1, suppose ρ0
is a nonegative, C 2-function, bounded at inﬁnity (or on the boundary of a relatively
compact subset of IRn - cf. remark to theorem 5.1) together with its ﬁrst derivatives,
satisfying (6.10); φ in (6.5) has compact support; h(0) = 0 for h in (6.6).
Then, (6.12) is valid and (6.4) holds locally, i.e.

q(t, ~y, ~x) ρ0(~y)dµ(~y) = ρ0(~x)

(6.4′)

Z

20

from which the H-theorem follows (cf.(6.6)).

We may use proposition 6.2 to get an instructive, albeit more special, diﬀerential

form of the H-theorem : If h is twice diﬀerentiable, then by (6.12), at least formally

dH
dt

=

Z

h′( ˜φt)Z †( ˜φtρ0)dµ

where ˜φt = φt/ρ0, h′(y) = dh/dy. Using (5.7), (6.10) directly and in the form

h( ˜φt)Z †ρ0dµ = 0 we ﬁnd after a straightforward but lengthy calculation,

ρ0( ˜φt)h′′( ˜φt)aij∂i ˜φt∂j ˜φtdµ

(6.13)

(6.14)

(6.15)

(for instance if h is a C 1-function with h(0) = 0, e.g. h(x) = x2).

Since h′′ ≥ 0, the H-theorem holds if and only if aij is a nonnegative-deﬁnite matrix
(cf. proposition 4.3 of Ref.6; for stochastic matrices see Ref.2 section V.5). This shows
explicitly the close connection between conservation of positivity (cf. (3.4), (5.3)) and

the existence of H-functions, though theorem 6.1 is more general.
In view of the
remark to proposition 6.1 and apart from regularity conditions on the coeﬃcients of

the generator Z, equation (5.3), such an operator having a nonegative-deﬁnite second
order coeﬃcient, leads to a satisfactory kinetic description (c.f. end of section 2) in

the sense that it deﬁnes a Markov semigroup satisfying a general H-theorem, once the
existence of a bounded at inﬁnity equilibrium solution (possibly of the MB-type) for its

formal adjoint has been assured. As a ﬁnal remark, notice that by the above discussion
(cf.(6.14)), such a solution ensures that the Markov semigroup property is equivalent to
the existence of H-functions (cf. in this respect Refs.33).

As already mentioned, this follows if Hi = 0, equation (5.7), which is valid in the for-
malism developed in Refs.6, 7 thus proving that the latter provides a satisfactory kinetic

description for open systems interacting with large baths at canonical equilibrium.

Ttf (x) ≡

p(t, x, dy)f (y)

(A.1.2)

lim

p(t, x, E) = 1

uniformily in x ∈ E

(A.1.3)

Tt is called a Feller semigroup and we have the following theorem34,35 used in the proof
of theorems 3.1, 4.1

Theorem A.1.1 Uniformly stochastically continuous Markov processes on M are in

1-1 correspondence with s-continuous Markov semigroups on C(M, C), the latter being
equipped with the supremum norm.

Outline of proof: (⇒) It is easily shown that (A.1.2) deﬁnes a positivity and nor-
malization preserving semigroup. By a standard argument, uniformity of the limit in
(A.1.3) implies s-continuity of Tt.
(⇐) Let Tt be a Markov semigroup on C(M, C). For each x ∈ M, t ≥ 0

ℓ : C(M, C) → C :

ℓ(f ) = Ttf (x)

is a positive (hence bounded) linear functional on C(M, C). By (2.6) and theorem
2.1 there exists a unique probability measure p(t, x, ·) such that (A.1.2) holds. (A.1.1)
follows from the uniqueness of p(t, x, ·) and the semigroup property of Tt. Condition (ii)
is proved by using for every compact or open E, a monotonic sequence of continuous

22

28 to show that limn→+∞ Ttfn(x) = p(t, x, E),
functions fn, converging pointwise to χE
so that condition (ii) holds for such E. Then taking account of the regularity of p 14,
this result is extended to all Borel sets. (A.1.3) is proved by taking for every Borel set

E and x ∈ E, an f ∈ C(M, IR) vanishing outside E, and f (x) > 0, and consider the
continuous function

g(y) =

1,
f (y)
f (x) ,

(

f (y) ≥ f (x)
f (y) < f (x)

for which 0 < g(y) ≤ 1 for all y such that f (y) > 0. Then it is easily shown that
g(x) − Ttg(x) ≥ 1 − p(t, x, E) and (A.1.3) follows by the s-continuity of Tt.
Q.E.D.

Remarks: (a) It can be shown34 that by the compactness of M, pointwise convergence in
(A.1.3) is equivalent to uniform stochastic continuity, based on the fact that pointwise
convergence of Tt for t = 0 is equivalent to w-continuity for t = 0.
(b) Using (2.3) and the regularity of p(0, x, ·), we get p(0, x, E) = χE(x) for any Borel
set E.
(c) For every (positive and/or probability) measure ν deﬁning uniquely ℓ ∈ C ∗(M, C),
T ∗
t ℓ is uniquely speciﬁed by the (positive and/or probability) measure

νt(E) =

p(t, x, E)dν(x)

APPENDIX 2

Here we present one-dimensional examples of Markov semigroups, for which a non-
integrable equilibrium solution ρ0, satisfying (6.10) exists, but which nevertheless satisfy
the requirements of corollary 6.1, hence they obey a global H-theorem (for their physical
interepretation see ref.36)

(a)

ZA = (1 + x2)∂2

xA − (2α − 1)x∂xA x ∈ IR, α ≥ −1/2

(b)

ZA = x2∂2

xA + (1 − (2α − 1)x)∂xA x > 0, α ≥ −1/2

The corresponding (unnormalized) equilibrium solution ρ0 of their formal adjoints are
respectively

ρ0 = (1 + x2)−(α+1/2) ,

ρ0(x) = x−(2α+1)e−1/x

(notice that Hi in (5.7) vanishes identically - cf. remark to proposition 6.1). It can
be shown that for −1/2 ≤ α ≤ 0, these solutions are not integrable, although they

23

satisfy the conditions of corollary 6.1, hence the corresponding semigroups satisfy an
H-theorem in the sense of theorem 6.1. Notice that when the phase space is not IRn
∞, as
in (b) above, the results of section 6 are still valid provided we replace any conditions

imposed at inﬁnity, with the same conditions on the boundary of the phase space.

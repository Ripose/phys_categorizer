hexagonal  lattice  photonic  crystal  with  a  metallic  basis  embedded  in  foam.  It  has  been  simulated  with 

Ansoft  HFSSTM  in  a  frequency  range  from  7.0  to  12.0  GHz.  Simulated  results  tested  experimentally  and 

negative  refraction  verified  in  some  frequencies.  Experimental  results  are  in  excellent  agreement  with 

 

 

simulations.  

Introduction: Photonic crystals (PCs) are structures with periodic arrangements of dielectrics or metals. 

In such medium, we can write this equation for magnetic field H:

This is an eigenvalue equation. It can be shown that 

×(cid:9)

×(cid:9)

is a Hermitian operator, thus Eq.1 is

similar  to  Shrodinger  equation  in  solid  state  physics.  Every  periodicity  in

case of photonic crystals we have a periodicity in

Where  R  is  a  general  vector  for  describing  lattice  symmetry.  Such  periodicity  make  limitations  on 

acceptable  eigenvaluse(

).  These  limitations  are  the  origin  of  interesting  properties  of  photonic  crystals

including photonic band gaps, negative refraction and so on. 

Many studies were made recently in this area. All-angle negative refraction from PCs was presented in [1] 

and negative refraction from metallic/dielectric PCs at frequency points was demonstrated numerically and 

experimentally  in  [2–  8  ].  Negative  refraction  demonstrated  also  in  two  dimensional  Metallic  photonic 

crystals (PC) in microwave frequencies [8-9].  

Design  and  Simulation: We  have  used  Ansoft  HFSSTM  for  simulating  the  refraction  from  the  fabricated 

structure. The refraction angles were predicted at 7.0– 12.0 GHz with steps equal to 500 MHz. The results 

are  shown  in  Fig.1.The  normal  on  the  refraction  surface  is  in1470 angle.  Thus  beams  emerged  in  lower 

1470 are negative refracted beams. Negative refraction is predicted for 7.0, 9.5 and 10.5 GHz, as it can be 

seen from Fig.1 (a) and (b). For these frequencies, negative refracted beam are strong and clear. For 11.5 

GHz there are both positive and negative refractions with nearly equal intensities. The results are listed in 

Table.1.

Experimental and Measurements: We made 3D photonic crystal of copper rods with diameter 0.63 cm and 

height of 1.5 cm arranged in a 3D array with a 3D hexagonal lattice. We drew the lattice on plates of foam 

(1.5  cm  thick)  and  then  insert  copper  bars  into  lattice  points.  We  made  27  layers.  Then  different  layers 

stacked  and  formed  a  3D  system  (Fig.2).  The  ratio  of  the  radius  r to  the  lattice  constant  a(=b=c)  was  r

/a=0.2.  Transmission  measurements  are  performed  to  verify  and  test  the  negative  refraction.  The 

experimental  setup  used  in  this  study  is  similar  to  negative  refraction  studies  in  [3–5]  and  is  illustrated  in 

Fig.3. A square X-band horn placed at 3.5 m from the PC acts as a plane-wave source. Placing a piece of 

microwave absorber with a 12×12 cm2 aperture in front of the PC narrows the incident beam. On the other 

side of room another square horn attached to a goniometer swings around in two-degree steps to receive 

the emerging beam. In all the experimental and theoretical results, the electric field is kept parallel to the 

bars.  Results  (Figs.4  and  5)  show  that  this  3D  PC  can  exhibit  negative  refraction  in  a  large  frequency 

range.  It  is  clear  that  in  7.0,  9.5  and  10.5  GHz  we  have  only  negative  refraction.  But  in  11.5  GHz  both 

positive  and  negative  refraction  occurred.  In  Fig.4  (a)  it  is  evident  that  negative  and  positive  refractions 

have nearly equal level of intensity. The results are listed in Table.2 for better comparison with simulation 

results gathered in Table.1.

exactly same as calculated result. The validity of Snell’s law in metallic PCs has been established earlier 

[10]. Comparison between results listed in Tables 1 and 2 shows that calculations and measurements are 

in good agreement.

Conclusions: We  have  demonstrated  negative  refraction  in  a  simple  3D  metallic  photonic  crystal. 

Simulation  results  and  measurements  are  in  good  agreement.  The  results  show  that  negative  refraction 

occurred  for  different  frequencies  and  in  some  frequency  points  there  were  both  positive  and  negative 

refractions.  The  results  of  simulations  and  experimental  measurements  are  in  good  agreement  (Table.1

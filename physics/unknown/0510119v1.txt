The atomic force microscope is a versatile tool that allows many routes to be used for investigating the
mechanical properties of soft materials on the nanometer scale. In the present work, experiments were per-
formed on polystyrene polymer ﬁlms of various molecular weight by approaching a vibrating nanotip towards
the surface. The variation of the oscillating amplitude of the cantilever is interpreted as the result of the growth
process of a nanoprotuberance. The growth rate is found to be dependent of the magnitude of the oscillating
amplitude and of the molecular weight. A model is developed describing in a very simple way the action of the
tip and a viscoelastic response of the polymer. The numerical simulation helps in understanding the nonlinear
relation between the growth rate and the vibrating amplitude of the microlever and describes qualitatively most
of the experimental features. For the softer material, experimental situations are found that allow the experi-
mental results to be amenable with an analytical solution. The analytical solution provides a fruitful compari-
son with the experimental results showing that some of the nanoprotuberance evolution cannot be explained
with the approximation used. The presents results show that there exists a new and fascinating route to better
understand the mechanical response at the local scale. PUBLISHED IN Phys. Rev. B 59(3), 2407-2416 (1999)

I. INTRODUCTION

The atomic force microscope (cid:126)AFM(cid:33) is frequently used to
investigate surface properties through the study of the oscil-
lating behavior of a cantilever. The mechanical vibration of a
cantilever was ﬁrst used to provide an image of the force
gradient variations above the surface. A linear analysis
shows that force gradients are detected as shifts in the reso-
nant frequency.1 Taking advantage of the tip-surface interac-
tion, this mode of analysis has a variety of applications, in-
cluding noncontact surface proﬁlometry,2,3 imaging localized
charge,4,5 and, recently, providing a contrast at the atomic
scale.6–9 Nevertheless, when the tip is very close or slightly
touches the surface the system is highly nonlinear.10–13 This
nonlinear behavior increases the complexity of the cantilever
response, and the physical origin of the contrast at the atomic
scale becomes more difﬁcult to describe, but in turn the un-
stable behavior of the cantilever can be used to improve the
sensitivity of the AFM.

In Ref. 13 it was shown that the attractive interaction
between the tip and the surface is able to strongly modify the
oscillating behavior of the tip-cantilever system. As soon as
the tip is near the surface, typically for a tip-surface distance
of approximately 1 nm and for a drive frequency slightly
below the resonance frequency, the oscillator shows a bifur-
cation from a monostable to a bistable state. The bifurcation
leads to a cycle of hysteresis. The attractive force ﬁeld intro-
duces nonlinear coupling terms that make the magnitude of
the drive amplitude a key parameter. An analytical expres-
sion is derived showing that the shape of the hysteresis is
dependant of the drive amplitude through a cubic law.13 A
well-deﬁned cycle of hysteresis can be experimentally ob-
tained, but this happens strictly for surfaces that are inert
mechanically, or that have a local stiffness large enough for
an elastic displacement not to be induced.

The scope of the present work is to investigate what hap- P

pens when a sample has a mechanical susceptibility, the re-
ciprocal of a stiffness, that allows the surface to exhibit a
sizable elastic displacement under the action of the tip. The
aim is to explore a new route to probe the mechanical re-
sponse of a surface at the nanometer scale without touching
or only slightly touching the surface.

The paper is organized as follows, in a second section we
detail the experimental methodology and give the experi-
mental results. In the third section the main ideas of the
theoretical simulation that describes the kinetics of a nano-
protuberance are introduced. In the last section we discuss
the usefulness and the limits of the hypothesis that sustain
the simulation and introduce a simple rheological model. The
phenomenological model is essentially heuristic and should
help us to deﬁne new experiments and further quantitative
analysis.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

A. Methodology

The experiments have been performed in air and record-
ings were made by approaching the surface towards the tip
using the tapping mode of a nanoscope III.14 Two piezoac-
tuators are needed to perform an experiment in the tapping
mode. A small piezo allowing the microlever to be vibrated
at a frequency close to its resonance frequency and a second
piezo moving the sample. The piezoactuator holding the
sample is a piezo with a maximum vertical displacement of
660 nm giving a low noise signal with a good resolution.

At a ﬁx position of the plane surface, the sample is ap-
proached towards the tip. It then is retracted when the tip is
near the surface. To get a simple criterion, the drive fre-
quency is slightly below the resonance frequency, such that
the vibrating amplitude is below the resonant one. With this

FIG. 1. Typical S shape of the oscillations as a function of the
distance between the surface and the position at rest of the mi-
crolever. A f is the amplitude of the oscillations far from the surface,
typically for distance above 20 nm(cid:49)A f . For inﬁnitely hard surface,
the amplitude decreases linearly with the distance as soon as an
intermittent contact happens (cid:126)domain 2(cid:33). When the distance be-
tween the equilibrium position at rest of the microlever and the
surface is zero, the amplitude becomes zero (cid:126)domain 3(cid:33). Experi-
ments have been performed in the domain deﬁned by the circle

condition, the amplitude of the vibrating cantilever increases
when the attractive force ﬁeld between the tip and the surface
becomes large enough. Therefore, as soon as an increase of
the amplitude is observed, the sample is retracted and the
range of the tip-sample distance is restricted to the domain
represented by the circle drawn in Fig. 1.

Far from the surface, the vibrating amplitude of the can-
tilever, here after noted the free amplitude A f , is given by
the well-known expression

and the damping factor of the cantilever.

The variation of the amplitude as a function of the tip-
surface distance depends on the magnitude of the free ampli-
tude. For large free amplitudes A f a cycle of hysteresis fol-
lows, while for small amplitudes A f the same variation is
observed during the approach and the retraction of the
sample (cid:126)Fig. 2(cid:33). In other words, for small A f , whatever the
distance between the tip and the sample, the variation of the
amplitude is reversible, while a cycle of hysteresis is ob-
served for large A f values. Theoretically, the whole features
can be described as a function of the magnitude of the free
amplitude.13 At small A f values, the effect of the nonlinear
coupling terms vanishes and the oscillating behavior of the
cantilever is satisfactorily described by a linear analysis.
Thus, for a surface that is mechanically inert, a typical re-
sponse of the tip-cantilever system will be identical either to
the one shown in Fig. 2(cid:126)a(cid:33) or in 2(cid:126)b(cid:33).

The samples are polystyrene (cid:126)PS(cid:33) ﬁlms. Several PS ﬁlms
have been prepared with molecular weights varying between
284 000 and 1890 and polydispersities ranging between 1.03
and 1.07 (cid:64)Fluka, Chemika, Buchs/Switzerland(cid:35). The baseline

idea is that an organic material interacts with the tip uniquely
through the van der Waals London dispersive force so that
the strength of the attractive interaction is simply given by
the product of the radius of the tip and the Hamaker constant
(cid:64)see Eq. (cid:126)4(cid:33)(cid:35). The Hamaker constant is a function of the
chemical composition and of the density of the two interact-
ing materials,15 thus does not depend of the molecular
weight. Consequently, by using the same tip to investigate
samples of various molecular weights, thus keeping the same
radius of curvature of the tip, the strength of the attractive
interaction between the tip and the surface is a constant in-
dependent of the molecular weight.

Besides, at the local scale, the mechanical properties of
the surface were shown to be molecular weight dependent.16
The smaller the molecular weight, the softer the material.
Therefore, if any change of the oscillating behavior occurs as
a function of the PS ﬁlms properties, one expects that it will
correspond to the change of the mechanical properties of the
PS ﬁlms and not to the change of the tip-PS attractive inter-
action.

(cid:53)292.57 kHz is kept the same throughout the experiments.
For the sake of clarity, we report selected experimental
data corresponding to the retracting displacement of the
sample. These data have been selected from among 10–20
experiments for each sample, with A f varying from 5 up to
44 nm. To be more easily compared, the experimental data
have been subtracted from their A f values (cid:126)Fig. 3(cid:33).

prepared as described in Ref. 17. The silica surface is used as
a hard reference surface from which we do not expect an
elastic response. The three surfaces give similar variations of
the amplitude as a function of the vertical displacement of
the sample. Irrespective of the magnitude of the free ampli-

tude, down to A f

agreement with the theoretical predictions and the whole
variations can be ascribed with the effect of the attractive
tip-surface interaction.13

For the sample of molecular weight M w

(cid:53)95 000 a drastic
change is observed at the small A f values 10 and 6 nm (cid:64)Fig.
3(cid:126)d(cid:33)(cid:35). In place of the usual loop, the amplitudes abruptly
decrease, almost down to a zero value. One can also note a
variation of the amplitude showing a slight perturbation at
the beginning of the cycle for the intermediate values of A f .
The response of the vibrating cantilever shows a com-

(cid:53)3250 (cid:64)Figs. 3(cid:126)e(cid:33) and 3(cid:126)f(cid:33)(cid:35). Except for the highest
and M w
A f values, the cycles of the hysteresis show a marked de-
crease of the amplitude just after the retracting displacement
has been started. The smaller the free amplitude, the more
pronounced is the minimum of
the amplitude. For A f

spectively, for M w

The results show that the oscillating behavior cannot be
described by uniquely considering the attractive force ﬁeld.
For example, let us compare the results obtained with the

the hysteresis is observed and the amplitude returns to its A f
value after a sample displacement of 10 nm has been made.
For a smaller free amplitude, we normally expect a smaller
width of the hysteresis as observed for higher molecular
weights and the silica surface (cid:126)see Figs. 3–5(cid:33). Therefore the
oscillator should recover its free amplitude value at a sample
displacement smaller than 10 nm. The opposite behavior is

value after a sample displacement of 13 nm. Such a behavior

In order to better understand what is really taking place,
we focus on the abrupt decrease of the amplitude at the be-
ginning of the retracting displacement. At the beginning of
the abrupt decrease of the amplitudes, slopes can be ex-
tracted and multiplied by the piezoactuator velocity to give

the rates at which the amplitude varies. In Fig. 4 are reported
the measured rate of the variation of the oscillating ampli-
tudes as a function of A f for four molecular weights.

A general trend is easily extracted. The rate at which the
amplitudes vary shows a nonlinear dependence on A f and
increases as A f decreases. Furthermore, from the highest to
the lowest molecular weight, the velocity shows an increased
sensitivity to the magnitude of A f . For M w higher than
95 000, as noted above (cid:126)Fig. 3(cid:33), no noticeable decreases of
the amplitude were measured allowing a measurement of the
slope to be reported. Conversely, for the low molecular
(cid:53)1890, even at a high value of A f a measurable
weight M w
decrease is observed. For example, the same velocity is mea-

To interpret these evolutions requires consideration of an
additional interaction in which the sample properties, apart
from the Hamaker constant, must be included. Considering
what is known about the intermittent contact,10,19–21 we as-
sume that the tip touches the sample and that the true vertical
position of the sample is not the one given by the vertical
displacement of the piezoactuator holding the polymer ﬁlm.
In other words, we assume a local elastic response creating a
nanoprotuberance such that the tip touches the surface at a
vertical position higher than the one monitored by the piezo-
actuator. Such a situation is drawn in Fig. 5.

III. SIMULATION OF A LOCAL VISCOELASTIC
RESPONSE UNDER THE ACTION OF THE TIP

A. Preliminary remarks

It is worthwhile to examine ﬁrst how a vibrating cantile-
ver measures the growth of a nanoprotuberance. As the nano-
protuberance can grow rather quickly, the experimental re-
sults give velocities as large as 14 000 nm/s, one has to
verify the ability of the oscillator to measure such a rate of
perturbation.

Assuming that the variation of the oscillating amplitude
describes properly the growth process means that the oscil-
lator adiabatically responds to the perturbation. Let us note
h(t), the height of the elastic displacement at time t. If the
oscillator follows exactly the change of the height the de-
crease of amplitude is given by

A(cid:126)t (cid:33)(cid:53)A(cid:126)t(cid:53)0 (cid:33)(cid:50)h(cid:126)t (cid:33).

(cid:126)2(cid:33)

Equation (cid:126)2(cid:33) is true if and only if the perturbing process is
slow in comparison to the dissipative processes leading to
the establishment of equilibrium in the oscillator. The adia-
batic condition writes

dh/dt(cid:33)A(cid:126)t(cid:53)0 (cid:33)/(cid:116)

(cid:126)3(cid:33)

for a resonance frequency of 293.23 kHz and a quality factor
of 450, the relaxation time of the oscillator is (cid:98)(cid:50)1(cid:53)(cid:116)(cid:53)4.9
(cid:51)10(cid:50)4 s. For A(cid:53)10 nm, this leads to a maximum velocity
A/(cid:116)(cid:53)2(cid:51)104 nm/s. Thus a growth rate of 104 nm/s will not
be measurable. Indeed, for intermittent contacts, as happens
for nonlinear phenomena, one can demonstrates rigorously
that the adiabatic criterion is not given by Eq. (cid:126)3(cid:33). In the
nonlinear regime, (cid:116)must be replaced by a value close to the
oscillating period, here T(cid:53)3.4 (cid:109)s. The physical reason is
that
the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem, from which the
damping coefﬁcient (cid:98)of the oscillator is calculated, does not
apply when a nonlinear response must be considered. There-
fore the order of magnitude of the maximum velocity is now
better given by A/T(cid:53)3(cid:51)106 nm/s, making a growth rate of
104 nm/s measurable.

We shall proceed as follows:

(cid:126)i(cid:33) In a ﬁrst step we de-
scribe the action of the tip on the polymer. A very simple
approach is employed, the aim being not to get a quantitative
agreement with the experimental data, but to capture most of

mechanical response of the polymer is given.

B. Description of the tip-surface interaction

The attractive interaction between a sphere and a plane
surface is used as the external force acting on the polymer:15

(cid:126)4(cid:33)

where H is the Hamaker constant, R the radius of curvature
of the tip, and d the distance between the tip and the sample.
Taking the case where the distance between the surface and
the equilibrium position of the cantilever at rest is equal to
the free amplitude A f , one gets the time dependence for the
force:

F ext(cid:126)t (cid:33)(cid:53)

HR

where (cid:118) is the drive frequency and 0.165 nm is the ‘‘con-
tact’’ distance for most of organic materials.15 The contact
distance is used in Eq. (cid:126)4(cid:33) to eliminate the diverging behav-
ior. Let’s now deﬁne a distance d c between the tip and the
surface above which the action of the force becomes negli-
gible. Typically, with H(cid:53)5(cid:51)10(cid:50)20 J and R(cid:53)10 nm, for d
between 1 and 0.165 nm, F ext varies between 0.1 and 3 nN.
The approximation showing that the inﬂuence of the tip is
negligible for values of d above d c is

The static part of F ext(t) is proportional to (cid:116)
res , which in turn
increases as A f decreases. Therefore, even within this rough
approximation, the main experimental result showing the in-
ﬂuence of the magnitude of A f is preserved.

C. Local viscoelastic response of the polymer

At room temperature, the PS ﬁlm polymers investigated
are in the vitreous state and do have the same bulk elastic
properties.21–23 Therefore, the experimental results should
normally be identical and independent of the molecular
weight; besides, we did observe a large change in the friction
behavior as a function of the molecular weight showing that
the mechanical properties of the surface are different than
that of the bulk.16,21

Let us assume that for polymer chains at the surface, a
local viscoelastic response occurs when the intermediate and
low molecular weights are studied. The main difﬁculty is to
estimate the elastic modulus. Taking an elastic modulus at
zero frequency G((cid:118)(cid:53)0)(cid:53)108 N m(cid:50)2, with a protuberance

We further assume that the external force is given by the

simple steplike function (cid:64)Fig. 6(cid:126)b(cid:33)(cid:35) and the initial time t
(cid:53)0 is the time at which the protuberance starts the growth
process. With a step function, Eq. (cid:126)10(cid:33) gives an elastic dis-
placement at time t:

However, even with this oversimpliﬁed approach, because
res varies as a function of the time, Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33) cannot be used
(cid:116)
as is. After each cycle the height of the protuberance in-
creases, consequently the amplitude of the oscillator de-
creases and the residence time (cid:116)
res increases. This makes the
source term J 0F ext((cid:116)

avalanche effect. At the kth cycle, the residence time (cid:116)

sample moves downwards the quantity of interest reducing
the vibrating amplitude is not the height of the protuberance,
but the vertical location z k(cid:50)1 of the sample with respect to
the tip. Thus we subtract the vertical displacement of the
piezoactuator which, at the kth cycle, is equal to the product

The above numerical approach should be able to simulate the
observed features for memory effects remaining negligible
within the short time scale of the fast part of the amplitude
variation.

Numerical results are reported in Fig. 7. The general trend
is quite well reproduced. Quantitatively, it is not useful to
separate the magnitude of F ext and J 0 . The crude approxi-
mation of a rectangular periodic force together with our es-
timation of J 0 implies that it is not signiﬁcant to separate the
two terms. Thus, it is the product J 0F ext , which is varied in
the simulation.

An attempt to ﬁt the variation of the growth rate as a
function of A f is given in Fig. 9. The general trend is quite
well reproduced, but also is shown the inability of the simu-
lation to quantitatively reproduce both the fast and slow rate
regime. As discussed below (cid:126)Sec. IV(cid:33), one reason is that the
product J 0F ext and the relaxation time (cid:98) are kept constant
whatever the protuberance height.

IV. DISCUSSION

The height dependence of the residence time does not
enable us to solve analytically the growth process. Neverthe-
less, Eqs. (cid:126)12(cid:33) and (cid:126)13(cid:33) describing the fast part of the ampli-
tude variations provide information about the relevant pa-

when low amplitudes are used, the second slower, when the
amplitude returns to the A f value. The slow regime appears
unambiguously after the minimum has been reached with a
rather ﬂat extremum. As demonstrated with the numerical
results, the height dependence of the residence time clearly
account for the fast part, but gives a poor agreement for the
slow domain or just after the minimum. This could be due to
change of the characteristic time (cid:116)
N and of the stiffness dur-
ing the growth process of the nanoprotuberance. The picture
drawn in Fig. 5 gives an oversimpliﬁed description of the
nanoprotuberance properties. A more realistic picture should
probably borrow ideas from models describing grazes in a
vitreous polymer.24,25 Because the polymer experiences large
constraints at a local scale, the structure of the polymer can
be different than that in the vitreous bulk state. This, indeed,
is implicitly assumed when a viscoelastic response is intro-
duced (cid:64)Eq. (cid:126)9(cid:33)(cid:35). Also, nothing is said about the way the
constraint is transmitted to the bulk. Therefore we may ex-
pect a nonlinear response coming from the intrinsic change
of the polymer properties at the local scale.

The change of the relaxation time as a function of the
height is difﬁcult to assume. We might either consider an
increase of the relaxation time as the size of the protuberance
increases, which is the usual relation between size and time
relaxation or, on the other hand, for a column structure one
can expect the stability of the structure to be a decreasing
function of the height. Therefore a relaxation time decreasing
as the protuberance height increases.

To end this qualitative analysis, another possibility must
be discussed to explain the unusual variation of the oscillat-
ing amplitude. A polymer neck could be created between the
tip and the surface. Such a situation had been observed with
the polysiloxane chains grafted on a silica surface.26 In that
case, using the static contact mode, the additional elastic
force of entropic origin gives an additional deﬂection of the
microlever. However, the neck of polymer was created be-
cause of the capability of the polysiloxane chains to be
grafted at the apex of the tip. Such a process cannot occur
with the PS chains. In addition, as shown in this paper, the
elastic response was uniquely observed for polymers of mo-
lecular weight larger than that of the entanglement mass M e .
The entanglement mass of the PS chains is approximately
10 000 and the polymer ﬁlms showing the most spectacular
(cid:53)1890. There-
variations correspond to M w
fore an elastic contribution due to a neck of polymer between
the tip and the ﬁlm is quite unlikely to occur.

(cid:53)3250 and M w

In this work were also shown situations in which the sur-
face forces did have a signiﬁcant contribution.26 Evaluations
were done showing that surface forces become signiﬁcant
when the elastic modulus are below 106 N m(cid:50)2. Such values
are much lower than that of the PS ﬁlms (109 N m(cid:50)2) and
the lowest elastic modulus estimated for the nanoprotuber-
ances, around 107 N m(cid:50)2. Nevertheless, at the very begin-
ning, when the elastic deformation is small, one cannot com-
pletely avoid a possible contribution of the surface forces for
the most sensitive samples.

To answer the complex questions concerning the intrinsic
nonlinearity, it would be of great help to ﬁnd experimental
situations for which an analytical expression could be used.
(cid:53)1890 gives such an opportunity, the

rameters that allow the growth process to take place.

At this stage, it is worth to discuss the crude assumptions
employed to describe the local mechanical susceptibility of
the surface. The most interesting, but also the most difﬁcult,
is an appropriate estimation of this local response as many
parameters as the protuberance shape and the effective force
are unknown. One assumption concerns the choice of the
analytical expression of the attractive force (cid:64)Eq. (cid:126)4(cid:33)(cid:35) here
was used a sphere-plane surface interaction. A protuberance
ended with an hemispheric shape with a radius R can also be
considered. In this case a sphere-sphere interaction must be
used. Following the Derjaguin approximation,15 the attrac-
tive interaction goes asymptotically towards a strength of
interaction half that given by Eq. (cid:126)4(cid:33). As a consequence the
attractive force becomes a function of the protuberance’s
height and decreases as the height increases. This geometri-
cal effect has to be introduced with an expansion in term of
h/R in expression (cid:126)4(cid:33); including this effect does not make,
however, any marked changes in the results presented above.
Another point is the local stiffness of the polymer. To
estimate the local stiffness we need to estimate the size of the
local surface interacting with the tip. The diameter (cid:70) of this
area is roughly deﬁned by twice the radius of curvature of
the tip. The local stiffness varies as G (cid:70), thus typical values
of the product J 0F ext , between 5 and 10 nm, with R
(cid:53)10 nm and F ext
(cid:53)2 nN, give an elastic modulus G between
108 and 5(cid:51)107 N m(cid:50)2. Here again, because of the change of
the geometry of the sample, we might consider that the local
stiffness is a function of the height of the protuberance. A
simple structure, like a cylinder of diameter (cid:70) and height h
(cid:126)Fig. 5(cid:33), provides an estimation of the inﬂuence of this geo-
metrical effect. For a height large enough the stiffness G (cid:70)
must be replaced by a stiffness scaling as G(cid:70) 2/h. With (cid:70)
(cid:53)20 nm, a change of the local stiffness becomes signiﬁcant
for heights larger than 20 nm. The maximum height deduced
from the experimental data is found to be around 15 nm.
Thus considering the geometrical factors as having a weak
effect on the growth process is a reasonable assumption.

The third point is the intrinsic nonlinearities due to the
locality of the mechanical response. The experimental results
show two regimes in the kinetics, one very fast, particularly

plitude at large A f , between 28 and 44 nm, with a protuber-
ance height varying between 1.7 and 4 nm within a few
milliseconds. Thus, the arccos function of the residence time
can be expanded as a function of the ratio z(t)/A f , giving
the opportunity to make further assumptions to extract an
analytical expression. Where z(t)(cid:53)h(t)(cid:50)v pt is the effective
vertical location of the sample,

taking into account the ﬁrst order term of the Taylor expan-
sion Eq. (cid:126)15(cid:33) gives a self consistent equation remaining ana-
lytically soluble (cid:126)Appendix, Eq. (cid:126)A7(cid:33). The solution does
have the same structure as the one given by the expression
(cid:126)16(cid:33) (cid:64)Appendix, Eqs. (cid:126)A9(cid:33) and (cid:126)A11(cid:33)(cid:35) and have been used to
ﬁt the experimental data.

Not included in the above approach is taking into account
the elastic contact between the tip and the sample. The effect
of the contact between two elastic solids can be simply ex-
pressed through the stiffness ratio between the cantilever
stiffness k c and the contact one k (cid:102)(cid:53)G(cid:70). In contact mode, a
linear relationship between the cantilever deﬂection and the
sample displacement is observed and the slope can be less
than 1 if the contact stiffness is of the same order or less than
the cantilever stiffness.27 The slope (cid:97)between the cantilever
deﬂection and the piezoactuator displacement Z p , A
(cid:53)(cid:97)Z p , is given by (cid:97)(cid:53)1/(cid:64)1(cid:49)(k c /k (cid:102))(cid:35). Therefore, a change
(cid:53)(cid:97)v pt, and the
of the cantilever deﬂection is given by (cid:97)Z p
observed velocity becomes (cid:97)v p . For intermittent contact it
is not obvious that such an expression is straightforwardly
applied, particularly when dissipation happens during the
contact between the tip and the sample. It is far beyond the
scope of the present paper to discuss in details the usefulness
of the above equation to describe the intermittent contact.28
The equation to ﬁt the experimental data is of the form

z(cid:126)t (cid:33)(cid:53)S e(cid:64)1(cid:50)exp(cid:126)(cid:50)(cid:98)

Fits of the experimental variations are reported in the Fig.
10. Attempts to ﬁt the results obtained for the sample of
(cid:53)3250 at the highest amplitudes were
M w
also done. Since the experimental curves are correctly ﬁtted
with Eq. (cid:126)17(cid:33), it becomes possible to check the validity of the
approximations used. For example, for free amplitudes A f
varying between 32 and 44 nm, the effective vertical location
z(t) varies between 2.7 and 1.3 nm, corresponding to relative
variations of the amplitude of 8.4% and 3%, respectively.

FIG. 10. Comparison between the experimental data and com-

puted curves given by the Eq. (cid:126)A11(cid:33) (cid:126)see Appendix(cid:33).

Furthermore, since these corrections are partly taken into ac-
count with the ﬁrst-order term of the expansion (cid:126)15(cid:33), one can
(cid:65)2d c and
expect that the ﬁtted values of the product J 0F ext
(cid:53)(cid:98)
the relaxation time (cid:116)
N(cid:50)1 are independent of A f and, in
N
turn, of the protuberance height. As shown in Fig. 11, these
quantities that aim to describe the intrinsic properties of the
nanoprotuberance vary as a function of the free amplitude
A f . Therefore, the attempt to ﬁt the experimental curves
shows that Eq. (cid:126)17(cid:33) does have a too simple structure to de-
scribe satisfactorily the whole kinetics of the nanoprotuber-
ance. The fact that these two quantities vary as a function of
the height of the protuberance can have two origins: one is
the change of the intrinsic properties as function of the pro-
tuberance size as discussed above, the second is due to the
use of a simple viscoelastic response (cid:64)Eq. (cid:126)9(cid:33)(cid:35) assuming an
average homogeneous response of the protuberance instead
of an heterogeneous one as it occurs with a pointlike force
applied on an elastic medium.29

The numerical simulation shows the origin of the purely
experimental nonlinearity coming from the way the experi-
ment is performed. For small protuberance height with re-
spect to the free oscillating amplitude of the cantilever, an
analytical solution can be derived that allows ﬁts to be fruit-
fully compared to the experimental results. In most cases, a
simple rheological model is unable to describe the whole
growth process.

The above results show that by recording an image on a
soft material with the tapping mode gives a topography that
is a function of the experimental conditions employed. For
example, the step height of a liquid ﬁlm appears as a direct
function of the free amplitude used. The smaller the free
amplitude, the higher the observed height of the step.30 Also,

linear assumptions appear suitable enough to reproduce
qualitatively the main features describing growth rates be-
tween 3000 and 15 000 nm/s. At high initial oscillating am-
plitudes, or equivalently short residence time of the tip near
the surface, the growth process is found to be amenable to a
simple analytical solution. The main interest of the analytical
solution is to exhibit variation of the nanoprotuberance prop-
erties during the growth process that our present description
is unable to describe. Further work is needed to investigate
the nonlinearity of the mechanical response at the local scale.
The present works show unambiguously that mechanical
properties can be probed by simply approaching a vibrating
tip. It is also shown that the action of the tip can be simply
described by considering uniquely the static component of
the force. A direct consequence is that the strength of the
attractive interaction can be ﬁnely tuned by varying the am-
plitude of the vibrating lever.

the height of islands or aggregates of molecules grafted on a
surface may become a function of their mechanical suscep-
tibility. Therefore, the image recorded becomes a mixing of a
true topography and the mechanical response. Since the lead-
ing term of the action of the tip varies as (cid:65)1/A f, an easy way
to check the origin of the contrast will be given by recording
two images with two different free oscillating amplitudes.

V. CONCLUSION

The aim of the present work was an attempt to investigate
the ability of a vibrating tip-cantilever system, the Tapping
mode,
to probe mechanical properties without or only
slightly touching the surface. On the one hand, to achieve the
goal of minimizing the contact time between the tip and the
surface, we use a criterion based on the study of the cycle of
the hysteresis of the vibrating amplitude induced by an at-
tractive ﬁeld. On the other hand, polystyrene polymer ﬁlms
of various molecular weights were chosen as model samples
exhibiting different mechanical properties at
the surface.
Anomalous variations of the oscillating amplitude were in-
terpreted as a response of the vibrating lever to the growth of
a nanoprotuberance. The smaller the molecular weight, the
more sensitive is the polymer to the strength of the attractive
ﬁeld due to the proximity of the tip. In addition, the smaller
the initial oscillating amplitude, the faster is the growth rate
of the nanoprotuberance.

A numerical simulation shows the nonlinear relation be-
tween the oscillating amplitude and the growth rate, beside

28 A numerical simulation similar to the ones given in Refs. 18, 19,
and 21, in which a contact area computed with the Hertz model
is used, gives a slope of 0.16 for an elastic modulus of
(cid:53)3.5 N m(cid:50)1. Note that
107 N m(cid:50)2 and a cantilever stiffness k c
using the same values gives a slope of 0.04 for the contact
deﬂection mode. L. Nony, R. Boisgard, and J. P. Aime´ (cid:126)unpub-

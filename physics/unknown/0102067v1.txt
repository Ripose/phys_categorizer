ABSTRACT

The  values  of  writhe  of  the  most  tight  conformations,  found  by  the

SONO algorithm, of all alternating prime knots with up to 10 crossings are

analysed. The distribution of the writhe values is shown to be concentrated

around  the  equally  spaced  levels.  The  “writhe  quantum”  is  shown  to  be

close to the rational 4/7 value. The deviation of the writhe values from the

n*(4/7) writhe levels scheme is  analysed quantitatively.

1.  Introduction

Knot  tying  is  not  only  a  conscious  activity  reserved  for  humans.  In  nature  knots  are

often  tied  by  chance.  Thermal  fluctuations  may  entangle  a  polymeric  chain  in  such  a

manner  that  an  open  knot  becomes  tied  on  it.  This  possibility  and  its  physical

consequences were considered by de Gennes [1].

Whenever the ends of a polymer molecule become connected – a closed knot is tied.

Understanding  the  topological  aspects  of  the  physics  of  polymers  is  an  interesting  and

challenging problem [2, 3]. Formation of knotted polymeric molecules can be simulated

numerically [4, 5]. A simple algorithm creating random walks in the 3D space provides a

crude  model  of  the  polymeric  chain.  Obviously,  knots  tied  on  random  walks  are  of

various topological types. The more complex a knot is, the less frequently it occurs. The

probability of formation of various knot types was studied [6] and the related problem of

the size of knots tied on long polymeric chains was also analysed [7].

DNA molecules are not protected from becoming knotted. Knots of various types and

catenanes  are  easily  formed  as  intermediate  products  of  DNA  replication  and

recombination  processes  [8].  The  probability  of  the  knot  formation  within  the  DNA

molecules  was analysed  [9].  In appropriate  experimental  conditions  knots  tied  on  DNA

molecules of identical molecular weight can be created [10]. Although being of the same

molecular  weight,  the  topoisomers  display  different  physical  properties.  For  instance,

their electrophoretic migration rate is different and proportional to  the  average  crossing

numbers of  the so-called ideal conformations of the knotted molecules [11].

Tying a knot on a rope needs closing its ends. In the case of DNA, the closing is easier

if  meeting  ends  are  appropriately  oriented.  The  geometrical  parameter  of  a  knot

responsible for the relative orientation of its ends is the writhe of the knot [12, 13, 14]. As

shown  recently,  writhe  of  the  ideal  conformations  of  prime  knots  displays  a  curious

quasi-quantization properties. Below, we present results of our study of the phenomenon.

2.  Ideal knots

From the topological point of view a conformation of a knot is of no importance [15].

From the physical point of view it matters a lot. For knots tied on the ideal, i.e. the utterly

flexible but infinitely hard in its circular cross-section rope there exists a minimum value

of  the  rope  length  at  which  knot  of  the  given  type  can  still  be  tied.  The  particular

2

conformation  of  a  knot  for  which  the  minimum  is  reached  is  called  ideal  [16].  It  is

assumed that there exists but a single conformation which minimizes the rope length.

Fig.  1.  Evolution  of  a  loose  conformation  of  the  10120  knot  towards  its  most  tight

conformation. The evolution was enforced by  SONO algorithm. Calculations started with a

number of segments N=91. At the end of the tightening process the number of segments was

doubled 3 times up to N=712. Numerical errors within the final value of  writhe are smaller

than  1%  and  the  deviation  of  the  writhe  value  from  16  predicted  by  the  Cerf-Stasiak  is  an

intrinsic property of the conformation found by SONO.

Finding ideal conformations is not a trivial  task.  There  exist  a  few  algorithms which

are aimed to perform it. One of them is SONO (Shrink-On-No-Overlaps) described in our

earlier papers [17]. Fig.1 presents how simulating the process in which the rope shrinks

slowly SONO arrives at the ideal conformation of the 10120 knot. As seen in the figure,

3

the  knot  changes  considerably  its  conformation.  The  changes  of  conformation  are

accompanied by changes of its writhe value.

Initially, to speed up the evolution, the number of segments, of which the  equilateral

knot is constructed, is kept as low as possible. At the end of the calculation it is raised to

a value at which the inaccuracy of the writhe calculation is better than 1%.

Although  for  the  sake  of  brevity  we  talk  in  what  follows  about  the  ideal

conformations,  the  “ideal”    must  be  understood  as  “the  most  tight  one,  found  by  the

SONO  algorithm”.  There  is  no  escape  from  this  uncertainty  -  the  ideal  conformation  is

known at present only for a single prime knot: the trivial knot.

3.  Writhe

One  of  the  essential  parameters  which  distinguish  between  the  shapes  of  various

conformations of the same knot is the 3D writhe. (In what follows we shall refer to it in

brief as writhe.) If r1 and r2 are two points within conformation K of a knot and r1,2 = r2 –

r1 is the  vector  which  joins  the  points,  then  writhe  of  the  conformation  is  given  by  the

value of the double integral:

As  shown  by  Georges  (cid:16)(cid:2)(cid:17)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:9)(cid:18),  in  spite  that  at  the  r1  =  r2  diagonal  of  the  K×K

integration domain the denominator of the integrated ratio goes to zero, the integral does

not diverge.

Writhe  calculation  formula  defined  by  eq.1  is  valid  for  continuous  knots.  Knots

processed by the SONO algorithm are  discrete,  they  are represented  by tables  of  (x,y,z)

coordinates of n vertices. Thus, the calculation of their writhe must be  performed using

discrete sum formulae [18].

4.   Writhe quantization hypothesis

In  the  first  paper  on  the  geometry  of  ideal  knots  [19],  it  has  been  indicated  that  the

writhe within some families torus and twist prime knots grows with the crossing number

in  a  linear  manner.  Ideal  conformations  of  knots  discussed  in  ref.  19  were  found  via

simulated  annealing.  Using  the  more  efficient  SONO  algorithm  we  performed  an

extensive  search  for  the  most  tight  conformations  of  all  prime  knots  with  up  to  10

4

crossings. Preliminary analysis of the results we obtained for knots with up to 9 crossings

was described in ref. 17 where we pointed out (see fig. 8 there) that the writhe values of

prime knots with up to 9 crossings show a visible tendency to gather around a few, well

defined levels. No hypothesis concerning their spacing was formulated.

The  observation  stimulated  a  series  of  theoretical  considerations  [20],  which  lead  to

the hypothesis that for alternating prime knots the quantum of writhe is 4/7, and showed

that the actual writhe values can be predicted by a topological invariant computable from

any  minimum  crossing  number  diagram.  It  is  the  aim  of  the  present  paper  to  verify

quantitatively the hypothesis of the 4/7 writhe quantum on the set of all alternating prime

knots with up to 10 crossings.

Fig. 2.  Wr/(4/7) versus the knot number for ideal conformations of all alternating prime

knots with up to 10 crossings. Horizontal lines indicate the writhe levels suggested by  Cerf

and Stasiak. The gap visible in the set of plotted points in the vicinity of the knot number=80

corresponds  to  the  non-alternating  knots  with  9  crossings.  A  smaller  gap  localized  around

knot number=40 corresponds to 3 non-alternating knots with 8 crossings.

5.  Quantitative verification of the 4/7 hypothesis

If  the  Cerf-Stasiak  4/7  writhe  quantum  hypothesis  is  right,  the  values  of    Wr/(4/7)

should for the alternating knots be located close to integer levels. Fig. 2 presents the plot

5

of the Wr/(4/7) values of the ideal conformations of all alternating prime knots with up to

10 crossings. The values are plotted versus the knot number which localizes a particular

knot  in  the  Rolfsen  table  of  prime  knots.  See,  e.g.  ref.  21.  Confirming  our  earlier

observations reported in ref. 3 the plot reveals that the writhe values are distributed in a

highly inhomogeneous manner. The values of the Wr/(4/7) variable are clearly gathering

around  the  integer  levels;  the  Cerf-Stasiak  4/7  writhe  quantum  hypothesis  seems  to  be

qualitatively confirmed. The n*(4/7) writhe levels scheme was plotted in Fig. 2 according

to the suggestions of Cerf and Stasiak. It seems to fit well the data provided by SONO.

But,  is  it  really  the  best  writhe  levels  scheme?  A  simple  test  convinced  us,  that  this  is

indeed the case.

Fig. 3. The average relative deviation 〈|dW|〉 of the writhe values of all alternating knots

with up to 10 crossings from n*qW writhe levels versus the writhe quantum qW.

To check quantitatively which value of the writhe quantum qW fits best the set of our
writhe data, we calculated the dependence of the average relative deviation 〈|dWi|〉 of the

writhe  values  Wri  from  n*qW  levels,  where  qW  was  swept  throughout  the  [0.1,  1.0]
interval. The 〈|dW|〉 value was calculated as follows:

closest  to  Wri.  The  summation  runs  over  all  alternating  prime  knots  with  up  to  10

7

crossings. As seen in Fig.3, the relative average deviation 〈|dW|〉 of the writhe values from

the levels separated by qW displays a clear minimum at qW=0.5702, a value very close to
the  rational  4/7≅0.5714.  At  the  minimum  〈|dW|〉=0.075,  significantly  less  than  0.25

expected in absence of the quantization tendency.

Having  checked  that  suggested  by  Cerf  and  Stasiak  4/7  writhe  quantum    produces  a

writhe levels scheme which fits best the writhe values found by SONO we performed a

quantitative analysis of the distribution of observed deviations. Thus, assuming qW=4/7

we  calculated  for  each  of  the  analyzed  knots  the  deviation  dWi  of  its  writhe  value  Wri

from the closest n*qW writhe level. The plot of the deviations versus the knot number is

shown  in  Fig.4.  As  seen  in  the  figure,  the  deviations  are  spread  in  an  almost  uniform

manner;  their  absolute  value  is  never  larger  than  0.25.  The  width  of  the  spread  is  only

slightly  smaller  for  smaller  knots.  To  analyze  the  distribution  in  a  quantitative  manner,

we  divided  the  [-0.5, 0.5]  interval  into  bins  of  0.05  width.  Counting  knots  whose  dWi

value were located within consecutive bins and dividing the counts by the total number of

analyzed knots we obtained the probability of finding the writhe value within each of the

counting bins. The shape of the probability distribution is shown in Fig.5. The half-width
σ of the Gaussian which fits best the distribution equals 0.203. Moreover, as seen in fig.4,

the writhe value of none of the studied knots deviates from the Cerf-Stasiak quantization

scheme more than 0.25 qW.

6.  Discussion

Let us summarize results described above.

1.  The existence of the writhe  quasi-quantization  tendency noticed  previously  within a

very limited set of knots [17] has been confirmed within a much broader set of knots:

all alternating prime knots with up to 10 crossings.

2.  The qW=4/7 separation of the writhe levels suggested by Cerf  and Stasiak [20] was

shown to fit best the writhe data obtained with the use of the SONO algorithm.

The  half  width  σ  of  the  distribution  of  the  writhe  deviations  from  the  closest  Cerf-

Stasiak levels was shown to be equal 0.2. In view of the analysis of numerical errors we

performed, deviations of such a magnitude cannot be attributed to the inaccuracy of the

writhe  calculations;  they  must  be  seen  as  the  intrinsic  property  of  the  most  tight

conformations  found  by  the  SONO  algorithm.  Will  a  different  algorithm  of  the
determination  of  the  ideal  conformations  substantially  reduce  the  value  of  σ?  Will  it

8

reduce it to zero? Is the writhe quasi-quantization an approximate or an exact rule? The

questions posed above remain open. An independent analysis,  performed with the use of

a different knot tightening algorithm, could shed more light  on them.  It seems  also that

further  theoretical  considerations  along  the  line  presented  in  ref.  22  should  help  to

understand the origin of the writhe quantization phenomenon. But, whatever the answers

to the questions fromulated above, results of the present study confirm beyond any doubt

that the writhe of ideal conformations of  prime knots shows a strong tendency to group

close to well defined equidistant levels.

As mentioned in the introduction, there exist practical implications of the writhe quasi-

quantization  phenomenon,  which  were  not  noticed  before.  Let  us  assume  that  a  knot  is

tied  on  a  rope  having  a  certain  internal  structure;  let  for  the  sake  of  simplicity  it  be  a

bundle  of  parallel  threads.  When  forming  the  rope  into  a  knot  one  wants  to  perturb  as

little as possible its internal bundle structure, one should follow the procedure known as

the parallel transport. As indicated by Maggs [23], one can show that the writhe of a knot

is closely related to the Berry’s phase [24].

Fig.  6.  The  ideal  31  (left)  and  46  (right)  knots  tied  on  a  rope  with  an  internal

structure. The parallel transport of the internal structure of the rope leads in the case

of the 31 knot to a distinct misfit of the orientation of the meeting ends. The ends fit

perfectly  well  in  the  case  of  the  41  knot  –  the  arrow  indicates  the  hardly  visible

meeting point.

If connecting  the ends of the rope one wants to keep identity of the threads, the angle
of the relative orientation of the meeting ends should be equal to a multiple of 2π. This

happens when the writhe value of the knot is integer. From such a point of view, the tight

9

conformations of the knots whose writhe values are grouped around a non-integer writhe

level are more  difficult  to tie  than  the  tight  conformations  of  knots  whose  writhe  value

stays close to an integer level. Figure 6 presents the ideal 31 and the 41 knots  tied  on a

rope with an internal structure. As seen in the figure, ends of the rope formed using to the

parallel transport procedure into the 31 knot do not meet at a proper relative orientation.

The knot can be closed only when an additional twist is introduced into the rope. It seems

to us that the effect should be taken into consideration in the analysis of knots tied on e.g.

the DNA molecules.

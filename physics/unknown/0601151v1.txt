ABSTRACT  
 
We put forward an idea that physical phenomena have 
to  be  treated  in  5-dimensional  space  where  the  fifth 
coordinate  is  the  interval  S.  Thus,  we  considered  the 
(1+4)  extended  space  G(T;X,Y,Z,S).  In  addition  to 
Lorentz  transformations  (T;X),  (T;Y),  (T;Z)  which  are 
in (1+3)-dimensional Minkowski space, in the proposed 
types  of 
(1+4)d 
transformations  exist  in  planes  (T,S);  (X,S),  (Y,S), 
(Z,S) that converts massive particles into massless and 
vice  versa.  We  also  consider  energy-momentum-mass 
5-d space which is conjugated to the time-coordinates-
in  above 
interval  (T;X,Y,Z,S)  space.  The  mass 
mentioned 
space 
corresponds to the interval S in 5-d space (T,X,Y,Z,S). 
Well  known  energy-momentum  4-vector  P(1+3)=(E/c; 
is 
in 
px,py,pz) 
transformed 
the  5-vector  -  P(1+4)=(E/c; 
px,py,pz,mc)  in  the  extended  space  G(T;X,Y,Z,S)  and 
becomes isotropic for 5-vectors of the massive as well 
as for the massless particles. 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION   
 
We  consider  generalization  of  the  Einstein's  special 
theory  of  relativity  (SRT)  on  5-dimensional  space, 
having the metric (+ - - - -) [1-4]. The physical basis for 
such generalization is that fact, that in spatial theory of 
relativity masses of particles are scalars and do not vary 
in  case  of  the  elastic  interactions.  However  it  is  well 
known,  that  it  is  possible  to  consider  a  photon  as  a 
massless particle and to describe photon by a flat wave 
only in infinite empty space [5]. If the photon moving 
in  a  medium  or  in  the  limited  space,  for  example  in  a 
resonator  or  wave-guide,  it  acquires  a  nonzero  mass 
[16,17].  
We  offered  such  generalization  of  special  theory  of 
relativity,  which  takes  into  account  processes  under

which a mass of a particle m also would be a variable. 
As  a  mass  of  a  particle  m  we,  following 
the 
recommendations of the review [6], shall understand it 
a rest-mass, which is a Lorentz scalar. For this purpose 
first  of  all  we  shall  construct  the  extension  (1  +  3)  - 
dimensional Minkowski space M(T;X,Y,Z) on (1 + 4) - 
dimensional extended space G(T;X,Y,Z,S) . This space 
we  will  name  as  extended  space.  The  Extended  Space 
Model we will sign as ESM.  
Similarly  it  is  possible  to  consider  process  of  a 
modification  of  a  mass  and  for  other  particles,  for 
example, electrons assuming, that mass depends on the 
environmental  conditions  and  interactions.  Thus,  it  is 
represented  natural  to  expand  space  of  parameters 
describing  a  particle,  with  taking  into  accounts  that  it 
mass can vary during interactions.  
Let's reduce simple analogy. The free particle move in 
straight line, therefore to describe particle behavior, it is 
possible  to  limit  (1  +  1)  -dimensional  space  that 
consists from the time T and direction of movement X, 
as the remaining coordinates Y and Z remain constants. 
If  the  particle  begins  to  interact  with  other  objects,  so 
that particle can leave direct line along X direction and 
begin to move also in a plane (YZ), it is not enough of 
(1+1)  space  already.  It  is  necessary  to  expand  our 
consideration  up  to  (1  +  3)  -dimensional  space  now. 
Precisely  as  well  in  our  case,  while  the  mass  of  a 
particle  does  not  vary,  it  is  possible  to  limit  by  the 
Minkowski  space  M  (1,3),  but  if  mass  begins  to  vary, 
the space M (1,3) should be expanded.

Attempts 
electromagnetism  have  a 
long  history.  Modern 
approaches to this problem ascend to F. Klein [7] who 
showed,  that  the  classical  Hamilton's  mechanics  could 
in  a  space  of  higher 
be  represented  as  optics 
dimensions.  Later  on  Th.  Kaluza  made  an  attempt  to 
generalize  the  Einstein's  gravitation  theory  in  order  to 
include electromagnetism [8]. He proposed to consider 
(1  +  4)  -dimensional  space  with  the  metric  dependent 
on  the  electromagnetic-field  potentials.  This  idea  was 
developed  by  O.Klein  [9],  H.Mandel  [10]  and  V.Fock 
[11],  the  model,  constructed  by  them,  was  named  the 
Kaluza-Klein  theory.  The  trajectory  of  a  charged 

and 

is  described 

particle was shown to have the form of a geodesic line 
with zero length in 5-dimensional space.  
Yu. Rummer in his studies on 5-optics [12] has offered 
to  attribute  to  the  new  dimension  dimensionality  of 
action  and  to  assume  that  it  is  periodic  with  period 
equal to the Plank's constant ћ. Note, that the rest-mass 
of  particles  was  considered  to  be  fixed  quantity  in  all 
these  theories,  in  difference  from  developed  5-d 
extended space model (ESM) [1-4].  
The  subsequent  development  of  the  multidimensional 
[13].  Multidimensional 
in 
theories 
constructions  in  the  theory  of  strings  and  hyperstrings 
[14] are the subject of an independent field search. 
Close  to  ESM  is  the  theory  advanced  in  [15].  In  [15] 
there  was  constructed  (1  +  4)  space,  where  a  mass 
(substance)  as  fifth  coordinate  was  offered  to  use. 
However  in  this  model  (as  authors  of  [15]  write 
themselves)  it  is  impossible  to  construct  energy-
momentum tensor. In ESM this defect is absent [1-4].  
Our  approach  essentially  differs  from  all  listed  above 
models,  though,  conceptually  intersects  with  some  of 
them.

complementary to Lorentz transformations, change also

The  set  of  magnitudes  (3)  defined  5-impulse,  its 
components  are  saved,  if  the  space  G(T;X,S)  is 
invariant in an appropriate direction. In particular, fifth 
has a sense of a mass m that does not vary, 
component 
if the particle is moving so that particle is entire time in 
the  field  with  constant  density  of  substance  or  density 
of  energy.  This  density  of  external  substance  (energy) 
can be interpreted, as a component of an external force 
affecting on a particle.  
Thus from the physical point of view our extension of 
SRT takes as admissible the processes in which the rest 
mass  of  particles  changes.  The  possibility  of  the 
existence  of  such  processes  has  been  discussed  in  the 
literature. For instance, if a photon enters a medium or 
is found in a cavity or waveguide, it can be assigned a 
certain nonzero mass [16,17].  
In  difference  from  a  usual  relativistic  mechanics,  now 
we  assume,  that  the  mass  of  a  particle  m  also  is  a 
variable. It should be understood that mass of a particle 
varies,  when  particle  moves  in  area  of  space  having  a 
nonzero  denseness  of  substance.  As  to  in  such  areas 
slow  down  speed  of  light,  we  shall  characterize  its  by 
their  magnitude  n  -  refractive  index.  The  parameter  n 
links speed of light in a vacuum c with speed of light in 
a medium v: vn = c.  
According to ESM rest mass of particles - is a variable 
and  a  photon,  go  ahead  in  the  medium  with  the 
refractive  index  n  >  1,  acquires  nonzero  mass.  The 
probability  that  a  photon  has  nonzero  mass  is  widely 
discussed both theorists, and experimenters. The review 
of the last outcomes is contained in [18]. Our approach 
differs  by  that  in  ESM  mass  of  a  particle  is  not 
constant,  and  is  determined  by  external  effects  and 
processes,  which  affected  on  the  particle.  Formally 
such processes within the framework of our model are 
described by rotations in extended space G(1+4) [1-3]. 
One  of  the  main  physical  problems  in  ESM  is  how  to 
compare  particular  interactions  with  appropriated  to 
them  distribution  of  refractive  index.  In  each  separate 
case, this problem is decided in its own way.  
Gravitational  field  is  one  of  examples  of  physical 
objects,  to  which  compares  some  refractive  index. 
From the very beginning of origins General Theory of 
Relativity  there  was  a  problem  of  its  experimental 
checking.  One  of  such  effects  is,  in  particular  - 
deviation of light in a gravitational field. This deviation 
can  be  interpreted  as  motion  of  a  light  beam  in 
environment  with  an  inhomogeneous  refractive  index. 
Thus,  we  can  attribute  some  refractive  index  to 
gravitational  field.  We  will  consider  further  well-

known  gravitational  effects,  used  for  the  General 
Theory  of  Relativity  confirmation.  We  will  show,  that 
all of them can be described and in frameworks ESM. 
Let’s  mark  also,  that  now  attempts  in  a  new  way  to 
interpret  the  gravitational  effects  are  considered  by 
other authors [19-23]. 
Parameter  n  connect  speed  of  light  in  vacuum  c  with 
speed of light in the medium v = c/n. With the help of it 
is  possible  to  define  fifth  coordinate  in  space  G(1,  4). 
Thus the empty Minkowski space M(1, 3) corresponds 
to n = 1. In this medium light move with speed c. Light 
transition from medium with n=1 into medium with n > 
1  is  interpreted  as  an  exit  of  a  photon  from  the 
Minkowski  space  and  transition  of  light  in  other 
subspace  of  space  G(1,  4).  Such  transition  can  be 
described with the help of rotations in space G(1, 4).  
In  empty  space  in  a  fixed  reference  system  there  are 
two  types  of  various  object,  with  zero  and  nonzero 
masses.  In  the  extended  space  G(1,  4)  to  that  objects 
there are corresponds 5-vectors

In the literature there are two expressions for an index 
of refractive n, appropriate to a Schwarzchild field. One 
of  them,  we  shall  name  it  n1,  is  used  in  Okun  papers

Such  difference  in  definition  of  gravitational  field 
refractive  indexes  n1  and  n2  is  connected  with  follow 
reason: in above mentioned two cases we deal with two 
different  objects,  which  differently  interact  with  a 
gravitational field. In ESM to these situations there are 
corresponds also different rotations in extended space. 
 
4.  GRAVITATIONAL  EFFECTS  IN  EXTENDED 
SPACE MODEL 
 
4.1 Speed of escape 
 
Speed of escape v2 is that speed, which should be given 
to a massive body, located at the Earth surface, that the 
body  could  fly  away  from  the  Earth  at  an  indefinitely 
large distance. If M - is the mass of the Earth, m - mass 
of a body located at the Earth surface, and R - radius of 
this surface. Then expression for the speed of escape is

We will receive now formula (25) using ESM methods. 
Let’s  consider  a  massive  particle  at  rest,  which  is  at 
infinite  large  distance  from  the  Earth.  Within  the 
framework  of  our  model  such  particle  is  described  by 
isotropic  5-vector  of  energy-momentum-mass  (6). 
Space motion in gravitational field along an axis X can 
be compared to the motion in extended space G(1, 4) in 
plane (XS) from a point with refractive index is n = 1 to 
point  with  refractive  index  is  n(r).  Such  motion  is 
described by a rotation (14). 
Here  rotation  angle  ψ  expressed  through  refractive 
index n. Thus the massive particle acquires speed

As  to  in  this  case  we  consider  a  motion  of  a  massive 
body,  we  assume  natural  to  use  refractive  index  n2. 
Assuming, that it is close to unit, i.e. that

                          (28) 

 
In  case,  when  r  =  R  -  radius  of  the  Earth,  the  formula 
(28)  coincides  with  the  formula  (25)  and  gives  the 
speed of escape v = v2. 
 

4.2 Red shift 
 
Gravitational  red  shift  usually  considered  as  a  change 
of  a  photon  frequency  in  the  case  of  changing  of  a 
gravitational field, in which photon move. In particular, 
f  field  strength  photon  frequency  also 
at  decreasing  o
decreases [5].  
However  Okun  offers  to  assume  that  varies  not 
frequency  but  varies  wavelength  of  a  photon,  and  to 
name this effect as red displacement [24,25]. Under our 
judgment both cases are possible, but they corresponds 
to  different  physical  situations.  These  cases  are 
described  by  different  rotation  angles  in  different 
through 
planes  of  5-d  extended  space  expressed 
 
refractive  indexes.  In  a  general  theory  of  relativity  the
rmula that describes change of light frequency is [5]

0ω   remains  constant  during  beam  of  light 
propagation. And  ω  is a frequency of the same photon 
that measured in its own time. This frequency is various 
in various points of space. Let's consider the case when 
a  massive  star  emitted  a  photon.    Near  to  the  star  at 
small  distance  r  photon  frequency  is  more,  than  far 
from the star at large r.  At the infinity in the flat space, 
where  there  is  no  gravitational  field,  universal  time

We will consider now the same problem from the ESM 
point  of  view.  Within  the  framework  of  our  model 
isotropic 5-vector (5) is matching to a photon located in 
empty  space with n=1.  Red  shift  in  the frame  of  ESM 
to 
means  changing  of  photon  energy  according 
changing gravitation field strength.  Process of photon's 
motion to the point with refractive index n>1, at which 
the  change  it's  frequency  (and  energy)  happens,  is 
described  by  a  rotation  in  (TS)  -  plane.  Under  this 
rotation photon vector will be transformed according to 
0ω   (photon 
the  (7).  Hence  it  is  distinguis ed,  that

We  assume  that  for  the  calculation  change  of  photon

supposition,  that  photon  frequency  does  not

which  coincides  with  (29).  Thus  we  received  in 
extended space model for red shift the same expression, 
as in general theory of relativity. 
From  our  model  point  of  view  it  is  necessary  to 
consider formula (30) only as first approximation to an 
exact result.  
Let’s  estimate  correction  to  n  appropriated  to  ESM.  
When photon merged in the area with n > 1, it gains a 
nonzero  mass.  For  this  reason  part  of  photon's  energy 
can  be  connected  not  to  the  frequency,  but  with  the 
mass.  
To estimate magnitude of this energy we will consider 
follow mental experiment - measurement of the photon 
frequency,  when  photon  change  frequency,  in  case  of 
the  photon  fail  from  a  height  H  in  a  homogeneous 
gravitational field, with acceleration of gravity g.  
Such  situation  was  realized  in  well-known  Pound  and 
Rebka experiments [26]. Energy change corresponds to 
such frequency shift is equal

4.3 Radar echo delay 
 
Let's  assume  that  we  measure  time  of  light  signal 
propagation  up  to  some  object,  and  back  in  space. 
Radar  echo  delay  can  differ  in  dependence  from  that, 

does  this  light  spread  in  empty  space,  or  in  a 
gravitational  field.  Such  delay  was  measured 
in 
experiments  on  location  of  Mercury  and  Venus  [27]. 
The  experiments  give  satisfactory  agreement  with 
General Theory of Relativity (GR) predictions. 
These experiments also were analyzed in [28]. Here we 
do  not  interesting  to  analysis  of  these  work.  We  want 
only 
the  analytical  expression  for 
magnitude  of  delay  of  a  radar  echo  in  ESM  coincides 
what  is  received  in  GR.  This  result  can  be  obtained 
tΔ   is 
from  the  fact  that  the  photon  time  delay 
calculated  only  from  the  photon  velocity  v(t)  [24,25]. 
Let’s imagine that we locate the Sun. We have

Here Rs is radius of the Sun, rg - gravitational radius of 
the Sun, and re - distance from the Earth up to the Sun. 
Speed of light in a gravitational field is v = c/n. As to 
here  we  deal  with  photons,  it  is  necessary  to  select 
refractive index n = n1. Substituting it in (36), we obtain

Formula  (36)  coincides  with  expression  for  magnitude 
of  radar  echo  delay  obtained  in  [25,28].  It  is  also 
possible  to  obtain  in  the  frame  of  ESM  the  perihelion 
precession  of  Mercury  and  magnitude  of  light  beam 
deviation  angle  from  a  rectilinear  trajectory  in  case  of 
photon propagation near to a massive body [3]. 
Thus  in  ESM  framework  it  is  possible  to  obtain  the 
same predictions as in the GR.  
GR  predictions  can  be  received  in  ESM  based  on 
analogies  between optical  and  mechanical  phenomena. 
For  this  purpose  it  is  enough  to  use  only  technique  of 
rotations in the extended space G(1, 4) and formula for 
the  refractive  index  in  the  Schwarzchild  metric.  Any 
additional  ideas  and  suppositions  were  not  attracted. 
Actually  obtained  results  are  only  first  approximation 
in an evaluation of magnitude of gravitational effects.

6.  MECHANISM  OF  THE  DARK  MATTER  AND 
CONDENSED  BUBBLE  OBJECTS  FORMATION 
IN THE EXTENDED SPACE MODEL 
  
Within  the  framework  of  Extended  Space  Model  the 
processes  connected 
in  a 
gravitational field are studied also. These photons have 
a  nonzero  mass.  It  can  be  both  positive,  and  negative, 
and  photon's  energy  and  strength  of  the  gravitational 
field determine its absolute value [3].  
It  was  shown  that  in  ESM  model  formation  of  bubble 
gravitational structures is possible.  
In  the  frame  of  ESM  one  could  obtain  the  follow 
physical  picture.  Bubble  gravitational  objects  have  a 
halo formed by dark matter generated by photons with 
a positive mass. The photons with a negative mass are 
throw  away  in  free  deep  space  and  create  there 
antigravitating vacuum with negative pressure [3].  
In 
is  a  mechanism, 
according  to  which  in  a  neighborhood  of  massive 
gravitational objects the halo consisting of photons with 
positive  masses  can  be  formed.  These  halos  we 
associate with a dark matter. The photons with negative 
masses  are  concentrated  far  from  massive  objects. 
These photons will create areas of a dark energy.  
Such  areas  are  characterized  by  negative  pressure  and 
exhibits properties of antigravitation. This area calls the 
accelerated  extension  of  that  visible  part  of  the 
universe, which consists of a positive matter.  
 
CONCLUSION  
 
In  the  present  work  the  generalization  of  Einstein’s 
special  theory  of  relativity  on  5-dimentional  extended 
space  is  considered,  in  which  as  fifth  coordinates  we 
introduce the interval s of a particle. This generalization 
special  theory  of  relativity  on  5-dimensional  space, 
allows  constructing  5-  vector  p  =  (E/c;  px,  py,  pz,  mc), 
where  as  fifth  component  the  mass  of  a  particle 
introduced.  
All  components  5-dimensional  of  a  vector  are 
connected by a well-known formula:  
2 
+  c

E 
.  Within  the 
framework  of  such  approach  there  is  no  difference 
between  massive  and  massless  particles.  In  difference 
from  4-dimensional  Minkowski  space,  in  the  entered 
extended space the 5-vectors become isotropic both for 
mass, and for massless particles.  
As a result of magnification of dimensionality of space 
there  are,  except  for  the  Lorentz  transformation  two 
another 
transformations  of  space  (hyperbolic  and 
Euclidean  turns),  which  transfer  massive  particles  into 
massless and visa versa.  
During  all  of  these  transformations  isotropy  of  5-
vectors are not lost.

Abstract

The quark masses evaluated by the Particle Data Group are consistent with

terms in a geometric progression of mass values descending from the Planck

Mass.  The  common  ratio  of  the  sequence  is  2/π.  The  quarks  occupy  the

‘principal’  levels  of  the  mass  spectrum,  characterised  by  a  new  quantum

number,  n.  Hadrons  occupy  mass  sub-levels,  characterised  by  fractional

values  of  n.  The  quark  masses  of  the  model  are  used  to  formulate  hadron

mass  construction  equations  based  on  the  masses  of  neutral  precursor

particles. Hadron mass partnerships occur, in which mass differences arising

from  differences  in  spin,  isospin  and  isospin  projection  are  equal  to  the

masses  of  principal  levels.  Mass  partnerships  also  occur  between  the

charged leptons and pseudoscalar mesons.

Introduction

In the Standard Model  of  particle physics [1], the Higgs  mechanism of  spontaneous

electro-weak  symmetry  breaking  gives  the  particles  their  masses.  Precision  electro-

weak measurements [2] suggest that the mass of the Higgs boson is less than a few

hundred GeV. But because quantum corrections to the Higgs mass are quadratically

divergent in the Standard Model, the Higgs boson can receive a very large radiative

mass correction from a higher mass scale, which is inconsistent with the requirement

that  its  mass  should  be  relatively  low.  This  is  the  ‘hierarchy  problem’  of  particle

physics, equivalent to explaining the immense gulf in mass between the electro-weak
scale (~103 GeV) and the GUT scale of ~1016 GeV or the Planck scale of ~1019 GeV.

Various  approaches  have  been  developed  to  resolve  the  hierarchy  problem.  Among

these are supersymmetry [3], technicolour theories [4] and extra-dimensional theories

[5-10]. Whatever the solution turns out to be, it should eventually be incorporated into

an  all-encompassing  theory  that  includes  gravity  and  reconciles  it  with  quantum

mechanics [11]. The unification mass of the all-encompassing theory would be of the

order  of  the  Planck  scale,  the  natural  scale  of  string  theory.  According  to  string

theory, the properties of an elementary particle, including its mass, are determined by

the resonant pattern of vibration that its internal string executes [12]. The energy of

the vibrating string is largely cancelled by quantum mechanical effects to produce the

comparatively minute masses of the particles identified to date.

The  unified  model  has  been  built  upon  the  premise  that  particle  masses  are  related

directly to the Planck Mass. The quarks of the Standard Model are conjectured to be

the  elementary  units  of  the  model,  occupying  levels  within  a  mass  spectrum  that

descends from the Planck Mass in a geometric progression. The mass of the nth level

is given by

m

n

−=

n
mk

p

(1)

where k is a constant and 

mP

(
h=

/
Gc

2/1)

 is the Planck Mass.

2

First, the value of k in (1) is determined, from which values of n are deduced for the

quarks.  Non-integer  values  of  n  are  then  presented  for  the  hadrons  of  zero  orbital
+ light baryon decuplet,
angular momentum in the JP=1/2

+ light baryon octet, the JP=3/2

the pseudoscalar and vector light meson nonets, for charmed and bottom hadrons of

zero orbital angular momentum and for charmonium and bottomium states. Building

on  the  values  of  quark  mass  generated  by  the  analysis,  hadron  mass  construction

equations are formulated. Finally, particle mass partnerships are identified. All mass

measurements  referred  to  in  this  paper  have  been  taken  from  the  Particle  Data

Group’s listings, 2002 [13].

The Particle Mass Equation

To  determine  the  value  of  k  in  (1),  relationships  were  sought  between  the  quark

masses. The Particle Data Group evaluate a range of mass values for each quark, so it

was necessary to extract from the ranges a single value of mass for each quark. The

mid-range values were taken. The data are presented in Table 1.

The up, down and strange quark masses of Table 1 are  MS  values at a scale µ ≈ 2

GeV. The charm and bottom quark masses are ‘running’ masses in the  MS  scheme.

The top quark mass results from direct observations of top events.

Since a wide range of values is found for the mass ratios of those quarks adjacent in

mass, the quarks will not occupy consecutive levels in a mass spectrum of the form

3

given in (1). The 

b mm :

c

 ratio of approximately 3.5 ± 1 : 1 suggests that k in (1) is

roughly equal to 3.5 or is a root of that number, perhaps close to 1.9 or 1.5. Values of

k were tested to identify a value that would produce near-integer values of n for the

mid-range values of quark mass evaluation. Crucial, though, in the identification of k

was  the  search  for  patterns  among  the  values  of  n  calculated  for  hadrons.  Such

patterns  did  not  begin  to  emerge  among  any  group  of  hadrons,  e.g.  baryon  singlet

states, until k was set to a value within 1 part in 104 of π/2.

Integer values of n in (2) are characteristic of ‘principal’ mass levels. Hadrons occupy

mass sub-levels characterised by non-integer values of n. The masses of the first order

sub-levels are given by n = r/2 in (2), where r is an integer. The masses of yth order
sub-levels are given by n = r/2y.

Uncertainty in the value of the Planck Mass (1.2210 ± 0.0009 x1019 GeV) gives rise
to a systematic relative uncertainty of 7x10-4 in the masses of all levels. For mass sub-

levels  of  fifth  order,  this  uncertainty  is  equal  to  0.024  of  the  level  spacing  and  is

usually  greater  than  the  particle  measurement  uncertainty.  Planck  Mass  uncertainty

and  particle  mass  measurement  uncertainty  will  therefore  not  obscure  particle  mass

patterns involving low order mass sub-levels. The effect of uncertainty in the Planck

Mass  will  be  considered  further  when  considering  the  high  order  mass  sub-levels

occupied by mesons. Throughout the paper, measurement uncertainties are displayed

on  graphs  as  error  bars  wherever  their  sizes  are  significantly  greater  than  the

diameters of the data point markers.

Hadron mass levels

hadrons,  and  cc   and  bb   states,  have  been  superimposed  upon  the  mass  level

spectrum in Figure 3. All particles in each of these four categories are confined to an

integer  level  interval.  The  n-values  of  the  charmed  hadrons  lie  between  95  and  96

Values of n for the JP=1/2

(uds,  I=1,  I3=0)  is  included  because  it  forms  a  ‘mass-doublet’  with  Λ  (uds,  I=0),

centred on Mass Level 97. For the 

 mass difference of 76.959 ± 0.023 MeV,

+ (udc) and Λb

0 (udb) baryons each appear

0 (ssc) apparently occupy fourth

and third order sub-levels, respectively.

Mass level numbers, n, of the JP=1/2

+ baryons are presented in Figure 5, superimposed

upon  seventh  order  mass  sub-levels.  The  isospin  singlet  states  (Λ,  Λc

occupy sub-levels of seventh order. The mass measurement uncertainty of Λb

0 (mass

of 5624 ± 9 MeV) is too great to assign a sub-level of seventh order to that particle.

The  isospin  doublets  (p  -  n,  Ξ0  -  Ξ-  and  Ξc
seventh  order  sub-levels.  The  masses  of  the  isospin  triplet  states   Σ+,  Σ0  and  Σ-  are

spread  across  two  seventh  order  sub-level  intervals  and  the  masses  of  the  isospin

triplet states Σc

++, Σc

+ and Σc

0 cluster around a seventh order sub-level.

To a first approximation, the mass of baryon

 is produced by the addition of the

masses  of  its  valence  quarks  and  of  an  electromagnetic  quark  interaction  term  to  a

neutral mass,

∆(1232)  states  cluster  around  a  sixth  order  sub-level,  of  mass  1232.16  MeV.  The

Σ(1385) isospin triplet states cluster around a seventh order sub-level and the Ξ(1530)

isospin doublet states lie either side of a third order mass sub-level. The association of

baryons with seventh and lower order mass sub-levels finally breaks down for the Ω-

baryon, which evidently occupies a higher order level.

The masses of the JP=3/2

+ light baryons increase by approximately equal increments as

hypercharge increases in magnitude. Naturally, a relationship was sought that would

describe  this  behaviour  in  terms  of  the  unified  model.  In  light  of  the  findings  for

that of Σ(1385)0 and the mass of Ω- from that of Ξ(1530)0. With

Meson mass levels and mass construction

The  I(JP)=0(0-)  and  I(JP)=0(1-)  unflavoured  states,  η,  φ,  ηc,  J/ψ  and  Υ  occupy  mass

sub-levels  close  to  those  of  fifth  order  as  shown  in  Figure  7.  ρ  (I=1)  is  included

because  it  forms  a  mass-multiplet  with  ω  (I=0),  centred  on  third  order  sub-level

97.875. η′ occupies a high order mass sub-level.

The mass of η (547.30 ± 0.12 MeV) is coincident with that of a fifth order level, of

mass  547.35  MeV.  Like  many  other  unflavoured  meson  states,  φ,  J/ψ  and  Υ  are

closely associated with mass sub-levels of ninth order. Values of n corresponding to

the masses of φ (1019.456 ± 0.020 MeV), J/ψ (3096.87 ± 0.04 MeV) and Υ (9460.30

± 0.26 MeV) are shown superimposed upon ninth order sub-levels in Figure 8. The ηc

mass (2979.7 ± 1.5 MeV) has too great a measurement uncertainty to assign a ninth

order  sub-level  to  that  state.  The  masses  of  the  states  in  Figure  8  have  small

uncertainties  compared  with  the  ninth  order  sub-level  spacing,  which,  for  each

listings are shown superimposed upon ninth order mass sub-levels in Figure 9. All but
the three heaviest states have small (≤10-4) relative uncertainties in measured mass. Of

the twelve states in the listings, eight are closely associated with ninth and lower order

mass sub-levels. The remaining states occupy higher order sub-levels as suggested by

the study of the χ states presented in Figure 10. The J=0 and J=2 states occupy sixth,

seventh  and  eighth  order  mass  sub-levels.  The  J=1  states  apparently  occupy  higher

order sub-levels.

Values of n for the pseudoscalar mesons and charged leptons are shown superimposed
on fourth order mass sub-levels in Figure 11. π0 and π± form a mass-doublet centred
on a fifth order sub-level (not shown). K0 and K± form a mass-doublet associated with
a third order sub- level. D0 and D± form a mass-doublet associated with a fourth order
sub-level.  The  B±  -  B0  isospin  doublet  and  the  Bs

0  meson  apparently  form  a  mass-

multiplet  is  associated  is  coincident  with  a  fifth  order  sub-level.  The  meson  singlet

states of Figure 7 were also shown to be associated with sub-levels of this order. The

charged leptons occupy high order mass sub-levels and will be shown to be related in

mass to the pseudoscalar mesons.

As in the mass construction of the Ξ- and Ξ(1530)- baryons, the masses of the heaviest

particles, K0 ( sd ) and D± (

dcdc ,

), in the K and D meson isospin doublets appear to

be  generated  from  the  mass  of  a  neutral  precursor  state.  Here,  the  mass  of  each

rise to a D± mass of 1869.49 MeV. The measured value is 1869.3 ± 0.5 MeV. The K±

Particle mass partnerships

Particle  mass  partnerships  are  defined  as  relationships  between  particles,  or  isospin

multiplets,  of  different  spin,  isospin  or  isospin  projection,  in  which  the  mass

difference  approximates  closely  to  the  mass  of  a  principal  level.  Mass  partnerships

the mass representative of an isospin doublet is that of its associated, interstitial, level.

The mass representative of an isospin triplet is that of the neutral state. Values of n for

Baryon-baryon and vector meson-baryon partnerships occur.

The Ξ0 - Ξ- isospin doublet has a mass difference of 6.48 ± 0.24 MeV, for which n is

equal to 108.48 ± 0.08. The two baryons do not form a mass partnership, as defined

here, though their mass difference is close to the mass of a first order sub-level. Some

non-strange hadrons form partnerships in which the mass difference approximates to

the  mass  of  a  principal  level.  The mass  difference  between  the  N(939)  and  ∆(1232)

isospin  multiplets  is  293  MeV,  for  which  n  =  100.04.  The 

n mm −

p

  isospin  mass

difference of 1.2933318 ± 0.0000005 MeV has an n-value of 112.05.

In Figure 11, the masses of the muon and the π mesons lie either side of Level 102 in

a manner suggestive of a mass-doublet. The 

m −

π m

µ

 mass difference is 31.63 MeV,

for  which  n  =  104.97,  suggesting  that  these  particles  may  form  a  mass  partnership.

The tau lepton and the D mesons lie either side of Level 96 in a manner suggestive of

a mass-doublet. However, the mass-multiplet also appears to include the Ds

meson.  The 

m

τm

sD

  mass  difference  is  191.5  MeV,  for  which  n  =  100.98,

suggesting  that  the  tau  lepton,  the  D  mesons  and  the  Ds

±  meson  may  form  a  mass

partnership.  Like  the  other  pseudoscalar  mesons  and  charged  leptons,  the  K  mesons

and the electron lie close to mass levels (Levels 99 and 114, respectively) for which n

is a multiple of 3. A mass partnership of sorts between the electron and the K mesons

is  suggested  in  Figure  11.  The  mass  of  the  electron  appears  to  have  been  displaced

from  a  more  symmetric  position  close  to  Level  99;  with  the  electron  in  such  a

position,  three  meson-lepton  mass  partnerships  would  occur,  associated  with  Levels

96,  99  and  102.  The  masses  of  the  K  meson  isospin  doublet  and  the  electron  are

related through

suggesting  that  the  electron  and  K  mesons  may  form  a  type  of  mass  partnership.

Again,  an  almost  exact  principal  level  mass  difference  is  found  for  a  partnership

involving strange hadrons. Curiously, the quantity

The W and Z weak gauge bosons may also form a mass-doublet. The

 mass

difference of 10.764 ± 0.039 GeV has an n-value of 92.06, close to that of a principal

level. The uncertainty in the measured mass of W (80.423 ± 0.039 GeV) is too great

to  assign  a  mass  level  to  that  particle.  The  mass  of  Z  (91.1876  ±  0.0021  GeV),

however,  has  a  much  smaller  measurement  uncertainty:  this  particle  appears  to

occupy a sixth order sub-level, of mass 91.187 GeV.

Conclusions

All particles, including those with orbital angular momentum, occupy levels within a
+  and  JP=3/2
unified  mass  spectrum.  The  quarks  occupy  principal  levels.  The  JP=1/2
light baryons, with the exception of Ω-, are associated with seventh and lower order
+ charmed baryons. Baryon singlet states lie close to
mass sub-levels, as are the JP=1/2

+

mass  sub-levels  of  low  order.  Meson  states  with  zero  orbital  angular  momentum

mostly  occupy  high  order  levels  but  are  associated  with  levels  of  fifth  and  lower

order.

The  masses  of  many  long-lived  hadrons  are  constructed  from  the  masses  of  neutral

precursor  particles  of  identical  spin  by  the  addition  of  quark  masses.  The  mass

construction of the K and D pseudoscalar mesons proceeds by the addition to the π0

mass of a value of mass which is related to the mass-to-charge ratio of the flavoured
+ baryons are also constructed from the
valence quark. The masses of the strange JP=3/2

masses of neutral precursor particles of identical spin.

Mass  partnerships  exist  between  particles,  and  isospin  multiplets,  of  different  spin,

isospin or isospin projection. Mass partnerships involving strange particles are often

characterised  by  mass  differences  almost  exactly  equal  to  the  masses  of  principal
+  baryons  and  vector
levels.  Fermion-boson  mass  partnerships  occur  between  JP=1/2

mesons, and between charged leptons and pseudoscalar mesons.

The mass of the electron appears to be displaced from those of the other particles and

is related to that of the K* isospin doublet interstitial level.

The  identification  of  a  particle  mass  spectrum  consistent  with  the  experimental  data

on  quark  masses  has  opened  the  way  to  the  discovery  of  hadron  and  lepton  mass

patterns  and  partnerships,  and  hadron  mass  construction  equations.  Hopefully,  these

findings will cast some light on the path to a unified theory of mass and force.

ABSTRACT 
 
Many asteroids show indications they have undergone impacts with meteoroid particles having radii between 0.01 
m and 1 m. During such impacts, small dust grains will be ejected at the impact site. The possibility of these dust 
grains  (with  radii  greater  than  2.2x10-6  m)  forming  a  halo  around  a  spherical  asteroid  (such  as  Ceres)  is 
investigated  using  standard  numerical  integration  techniques.  The  orbital  elements,  positions,  and  velocities  are 
determined for particles with varying radii taking into account both the influence of gravity, radiation pressure, and 
the  interplanetary  magnetic  field  (for  charged  particles).  Under  the  influence  of  these  forces  it  is  found  that  dust 
grains  (under  the  appropriate  conditions)  can  be  injected  into  orbits  with  lifetimes  in  excess  of  one  year.  The 
lifetime  of  the  orbits  is  shown  to  be  highly  dependent  on  the  location  of  the  ejection  point  as  well  as  the  angle 
between the surface normal and the ejection path. It is also shown that only particles ejected within 10° relative to 
the  surface  tangential  survive  more  than  a  few  hours  and  that  the  longest-lived  particles  originate  along  a  line 
perpendicular to the Ceres-Sun line.   
 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
  Observations of asteroids such as Eros and Mathilde indicate an environment where significant collisions have 
occurred in the past (Chapman et al., 1999, Davis 1999, Veverka et al., 1999). These collisions would have created 
debris, much of it in the form of dust particles. Experimental hypervelocity impact data suggests that the smaller 
debris particles (those with radii less than 1 mm in radius, henceforth called dust) have velocity distributions which 
might enable them to enter either short- or long-term orbits about the asteroid (Nakamura and Fujiwara, 1991). The 
dynamics  of  such  ejecta  is  important  in  constructing  collisional  time-scales  for  dust  present  in  asteroidal 
environments since the dust can adversely affect spacecraft operations in a variety of ways. The possibility of these 
dust  grains  (with  radii  greater  than  2.2  x10-6  m)  forming  a  halo  around  a  spherical  asteroid  (such  as  Ceres)  is 
investigated using standard numerical integration techniques. For this study, the asteroid Ceres was chosen as a test 
case both for modeling simplicity and the increased probability (because of its large mass) that it would retain dust 
in stable orbits.  
 
NUMERICAL MODEL 
 
Time-dependent orbits were calculated  for each particle primarily utilizing a fifth order Runge-Kutta  method 
 
(Nazzario and Hyde, 1997, Nazzario and Hyde, 2002, Nazzario, 2002) based on the Butcher’s scheme (Chapra and 
Canale, 1985). The Runge-Kutta method utilized a fixed time step and required six function evaluations for each 
step. Runge-Kutta methods are well suited to first order differential equations allowing the problem (since positions 
are  dependent  on  accelerations,  i.e.  a  second  order  differential  equation)  to  be  broken  down  into  two  first  order 
differential equations of the general form 
 

 y i+1 = y i +φ(xi, y i, h)h . 

(1) 

In Eq. (1)  h is the step size and the function φ is known as the increment function and has the general form 

  φ= a1k1 + a2k2 +... + a nk n. 

In Eq. (2) the a’s represent constants and the k's follow a recursive relationship given by 
 

  k n = f (xi + pn−1h, y i + q n−1,1k1h + q n−1,2k2h +... + q n−1,n−1k n−1h). 

(3) 
 
Since the k's follow a recursive relationship, this situation is ideally suited for solution using a computer.  In such 
iterative  methods  there  is  always  at  least  one  free  parameter  which  must  be  chosen.  The specific  number  of  free 
parameters will depend on the order of the Runge-Kutta method but is typically one. Once this free parameter is 
chosen, a Taylor series expansion can then be used to calculate the a's, p's, and q's. This calculation is accomplished 
by setting the equations equal to the terms in a Taylor series expansion given by 
 

y i+1 = y i + f (xi, y i )h +
    

′ f (xi, y i )

The k’s are related to the velocities while the M's correspond to the accelerations at the calculation points.

After calculating the M's for the current position and velocity, the new position and velocity can then be calculated. 
  A secondary algorithm utilizing a variable time-step was also employed to help determine an appropriate step 
size for the fifth order method. This algorithm, known as the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (Danby 1997), is a fifth 
order variable time-step method utilizing two Runge-Kutta formulations (a fourth- and a fifth-order) to estimate the 
local truncation error. If the local truncation error exceeded a preset tolerance (δ) then a new time-step would be 
calculated.  This  works  well  for  simulations  of  this  type  as  the  majority  of  the  force  involved  is  due  to  the 
gravitational acceleration of Ceres and the dust particles do not interact with each other. A tolerance of 1x10-6 was 
utilized in Eq. (26) (Danby 1997) to calculate the new time step which resulted in changes in energy, semi-major 
axis, and eccentricity of approximately 2x10-8 in a one-year simulation using time steps of 30 seconds. Therefore, a 
time step of 30 seconds was utilized in the main program and then verified by tracking one test particle for a period 
of  100  years.  No  changes  greater  than  2x10-6  were  observed  for  energy,  angular  momentum,  and  inclination 
(conserved values) during the test run.

The  model  was  also  utilized  to  obtain  numerical  solutions  for  the  accelerations  acting  on  individual  dust 
particles  incorporating  the  various  forces  acting  upon  them.  For  this  simulation,  Ceres’  gravity  (assuming  a 
spherical contribution only), solar gravity, the solar radiation and Poynting-Robertson effects, and the force created 
by the interaction of the interplanetary magnetic field with the charged particle were all taken into consideration.

in  this  work  all  particles  are  assumed  to  have  radii  greater  than  1.0x10-6  m,  the  radiation  pressure  efficiency  is 
taken to be 1.0 and ρd  is assumed to be the bulk density of Ceres (2800 kg/cm3).

In Eq. (30),

found in interplanetary space thus simplifying the charging calculation. In this study, the charge on the dust grain 
was taken to be 3 V upon ejection which is the calculated potential for a dust grain in the interplanetary medium 
(Kimura and Mann, 1998). 
 
INITIAL CONDITIONS 
 
 
A total of six impact sites were selected on Ceres, located at surface points along each of the six axes as shown 
in  Figure  1.  Ceres  was  initially  positioned  at  aphelion  (Lang,  1992)  revolving  around  the  Sun  in  the  counter-
clockwise  direction.  Each  impact  was  assumed  to  eject  a  total  of  72,000  particles.  Since  any  single  impact  will 
produce  a  variety  of  ejecta  sizes  and  speeds,  these  particles  were  assumed  to  be  ejected  at  different  speeds  and 
angles relative to the surface normal as shown in Figure 2. 100 particles of differing sizes (ranging from 2.14 x10-6 
m  to  214x10-6  m)  were  ejected  at  speeds  between  430-600  m/s  in  increments  of  10  m/s.  This  speed  distribution 
range  was  chosen  to  agree  with  results  found  by  Nakamura  (1992).  Each  set  of  particles  was  ejected  at  angles 
between  0°  to  90°  relative  to  the  surface  normal  (Figure  2)  with  a  10°  increment  between  ejection  angles.  The 
ejection direction was varied along the possible axes (±x, ±y, and ±z) at each point resulting in a total of 72,000 
particles. Thus, a total of 432,000 particles were examined. Upon ejection, the particles were subjected to the forces 
listed above. As shown in Figure 3, the shadowing effect of Ceres was taken into account for the radiation pressure 
force whenever the dust particle was in the asteroid’s shadow. 
 
RESULTS 
 
 
As  shown  in  Table  1,  particles  launched  at  angles  less  than  80°  from  the  asteroid’s  surface  normal  were 
quickly removed from the system either by collision with Ceres or by escaping to the interplanetary media. Only 
particles ejected within 10° of the surface tangent achieved stable orbits. Of the 432,000 particles launched, 3,504  

(0.8%) survived for one Earth year. Of those, particles launched from the poles were most likely to survive with 
2916 (83.2% of the surviving particles) of 14,400 launched from the poles entering stable orbits about Ceres.

The  average  speed  of  the  surviving  particles  exhibited  a  dependence  upon  the  direction  of  launch  but  only 
from the Y and –Y launch points. From the Y launch point there was a difference of 99.4 m/s in the average speed 
between  particles  which  were  initially  traveling  in  the  –x-  and  –z  direction.  For  particles  launched  from  the  –Y 
point, particles initially traveling in both the +z or –z directions ended the simulation with a speed approximately 84 
m/s slower than the particles launched in the –x direction. 
 
Particles ejected at the poles also underwent a complex orbital evolution resulting in particle diffusion 
throughout their lifetime over their orbital path as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Particles launched with the same

CONCLUSIONS 
 
Previous studies investigating the fate of dust particles have primarily assumed they were already in orbit 
 
about an asteroid (Hamiliton and Burns, 1991, Hamiliton and Burns, 1992) or had been levitated from its surface 
(Lee, 1996). More recent studies (Nazzario and Hyde, 1997 and Nazzario, 2002) investigated a single impact point 
to determine that dust particles could survive at least one year in orbit around an asteroid such as Ceres. In contrast, 
this study investigated ejecta resulting from multiple impacts of small bodies onto an asteroid’s (Ceres) surface. As 
shown above, the location of such an impact on an asteroid like Ceres will in large part determine the fate of the 
ejected particles. Particles ejected at the “poles” of the asteroid have the greatest probability of surviving for at least 
a  one-year  period  even  though  the  majority  are  quickly  lost  from  the  immediate  vicinit  of  Ceres.  The  average 
particle speed around Ceres (for particles up to 50x10-6 m) is low (< 300 m/s) but does exhibit variations depending 
on  the  position  and  direction  of  particle  ejection.  Even  though  the  average  speed  is  low,  some  dust  particles  are 
traveling faster than this and could pose a risk to spacecraft in the vicinity of an asteroid. The complicated orbital 
patterns  of  the  dust  ejected  from  the  asteroid’s  “poles”  leads  to  orbital  stability  zones  having  higher  dust 
concentrations  which  might  be  observed  by  orbiting  spacecraft.  Also,  the  low  average  speed  combined  with  the 
close proximity of the dust to Ceres will enable the remaining dust particles to enter orbits which may be stable for 
up to several years. This will be investigated in future work.

Abstract: −  Time-accurate  simulation  of  gas  dynamic  structures  resulting  in  viscous,  heat  conducting  and 
radiating gas flows through localized heat release areas is performed. Cases of intensive heat release in to air 
at  atmospheric  pressure  are  investigated,  whereby  the  gas  is  heated  up  to  temperatures  3000÷20000 K,  so 
that local differences of density reach tens and hundreds times. 

Bifurcation of the gas dynamic structure has been found at certain relation between gas velocity and heat 

release power.

1   Introduction 
The  necessity  for  studying  gas  dynamic  structure 
of  subsonic  gas  flows  through  localized  heat 
release areas arises in connection with research of 
laser-supported waves (LSW) [1, 2]. Certain kinds 
of  energy  devices  are  based  on  the  specified 
phenomenon:  the  laser  plasma  generators  (LPG) 
[3] and the laser supported rocket engines (LSRE) 
[4].  The 
to  problems  of  gas  flow 
interest 
interactions  with 
localized  heated  areas  has 
increased  noticeably  in  physical  gas  dynamics 
recently, first of all in connection with the probable 
applications in practical aerodynamics. The review 
of corresponding works is presented in [5].  

basic  attention  was  given  to  research  of  modes  of 
the  LSW  existence  and  speeds  of  ones  moving. 
Only in last years [13, 14, 19] a necessity for study 
of  the  own  unsteady  structures  of  the  LSW  was 
formulated. 

the  LSW 

In  parallel  with  study  of 

the 
numerical  simulation  studies  in  fundamental  gas 
dynamics  and  astrophysics  were  carried  out 
[18, 20−30]  under  the  description  of  gas  dynamic 
phenomena  accompanying  local  heat  release  in 
flows.  The  linear  and  weakly  linear  models  for 
generation  of  gas  flows  disturbances  by  means  of 
laser radiation are considered in [21, 22]. Acoustic 
disturbances  in  supersonic  flows  around  a  laser 
beam  were  studied  in  [18].  A  low-level  heat 
release  capacity  approximation  was  used  for 
description  of  two-dimensional  steady-state  gas 
flows  in  [23, 24].  A  nonlinear  one-dimensional 
unsteady theory of a thermal layer inside transonic 
flows of compressed gas is developed in [25]. Use 
linear  and  weakly  nonlinear  approximations 
allowed to obtain a number of analytical solutions. 
However,  cases  of  significant  release  heat  power 
and  of  pulsed  heat  releases  require  use  of  the 
numerical methods.  

Two-dimensional  numerical  simulation  of 
unsteady pulse heat release in essentially subsonic 
gas  flow  is  made  in  Ref.26.  The  problem  was 
solved  in  two  stages:  first  structures  of  shock 
waves  generated  by  a  pulse  heat  release  were 
the  slow  subsonic  flows  were 
studied; 
simulated.

This  study  concentrates  basically  on  physical 
regularities  of  subsonic  gas  motion 
through 
localized heat release areas. The physical statement 
of  the  problem  was  formulated  in  [6],  where  not 
only  experimental  study  of  this  phenomenon  is 
performed, but also an elementary one-dimensional 
model  is  considered.  During  1969−1984  years  an 
accumulation 
and 
development  of  various  one-dimensional  models 
(see review in [1]) took place. The first quasi-two-
dimensional  model  was  developed  in  1984  [7]. 
Detailed  numerical  studies  of  radiating  and  gas 
in  LSW  and  LPG  were 
dynamic  processes 
performed then for consistently more sophisticated 
models [1, 3, 8−14]. The self-consistent models of 
gas  dynamics  and  laser  heating  as  a  rule  were 
investigated  in  the  above  papers.  Further  progress 
in 
in 
[1, 15−17].  And,  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  gas 
dynamic structure has been described in detail, the 

the  experimental  studies 

reflected 

is 

A  numerical 

research  of  gas  dynamic 
processes involving interaction of supersonic flows 
with continuous and pulsed-periodical cylindrically 
symmetric heat release source is performed in [28]. 
It  should  be  stressed  that  in  all  above  papers 
unsteady character of gas flows were caused by the 
pulsed character of the heat release. 

Similar  investigations  were  performed  also 
with  reference  to  astrophysical  problems.  Study 
interaction of supersonic star’s wind flows with X-
ray  radiation  source  is  performed  in  [29, 30]. 
Equations  of  perfect  gas  dynamics  were  used  in 
this  case,  but  the  energy  release  capacity  was 
described  by  physically  proved  model  of 
interaction  of  X-ray  radiation  with  the  gas.  This 
study showed that a head shock wave is formed at 
high-power energy release, and there is an area of 
lowered density behind the energy source.  

A  series  of  papers  should  also  be  noted  on 
numerical  simulation  of  effects  accompanying  a 
local  heat  release  in  the  vicinity  of  streamlined 
bodies [5, 31]. 

The  problem  considered  in  the  following  is 

characterized by a number of distinctive features: 

1. The  study  of  unsteady  subsonic  motion  of 
viscous  heat-conducting  and  radiating  gas  in  area 
of  heat  release  is  based  on  the  full  system  of  the 
Navier − Stokes  equations.  Thus,  specified  non-
steady-state  modes  can  be  caused  not  only  by  the 
external reasons, but also by own properties of gas 
flows through the heat release area. 

2. Temperature  in  the  heat  release  areas  can 
achieve ~ 5000 ÷ 20000 K, that is the gas becomes 
completely  dissociated  or  ionized.  Differences  in 
gas densities in the region under consideration may 
reach ~ 200 times, because the pressure in this area 
a slightly differs from the atmospheric one. 

3. The  radiative  heat  transfer,  real  thermo-
physical  and  transport  properties  are  also  taken 
into account. 

A heat release area is considered in the present 
study as being fixed in space that is any changes of 
gas  dynamic  parameters  do  not  influence  on  the 
heat  release  capacity.  In  reality  when  the  gas  is 
heated  by  the  LSW,  situation  a  slightly  different: 
the  heat  release  capacity  depends  rather  strongly 
on  distribution  of  gas  dynamic  parameters  [2]. 
However, in the latter case it is difficult to specify 
the reason for occurrence of unsteady movements: 
whether  on  account  of  its  internal  properties, 
whether on account of periodic change of the heat 
release  configuration.  In  other  words,  the  fixed 
heat  release  area  allows  exclude  influence  of 
variability  in  the  heat  release  area  and,  thus,  to 
study  regularity  of  occurrence  of  the  unsteadiness 
caused by own properties of the gas flow.

coincides  with  heat  release  distributions  received 
in  self-consistent  model  of  LSW  [2].  Again,  it 
should  be  stressed  that  the  distribution  of  heat 
release  capacity  (Eq.(1))  is  determined  only  by 
spatial  variables  and  does  not  depend  neither  on 
time, nor from gas dynamic processes. 

Parameters of undisturbed gas were used at the 
entrance  of  the  area  under  consideration:  velocity

3   Qualitative analysis of the 

phenomenon 

Essentially,  the  problem  is  as  follows:  if  at  the 
fixed  undisturbed  gas  velocity,  for  example  at 
u =
0 100
m/sec, we gradually increase heat release 
power 
VQ , each time using just obtained solution 
for  thermo-gasdynamic  functions,  then  at  some 
value  VQ∗  a vortical (steady-state or unsteady) gas 
motion  may  arise  behind  the  heat  release  area.  If 
Q∗>
then at some value  V
 we start to reduce  VQ

gradually,  then  one  can  find  that  the  vortical  gas

can  say  about  such  well  known  phenomenon  as 
the  point  of  view  of 
hysteresis.  But,  from 
computational  fluid  dynamics  one  can  say  about 
very  significant  fact  that  there  is  certain  range

One  more fact may be of interest too. One of 
the  two  obtained  solutions,  namely  one  with 
recoverable  vortical  motion, 
is  steadier.  The 
numerical  experiments  have  shown,  that  if  the 
laminar  solution  is  chosen  as  the  initial  one,  and 
some  indignation  is  introduced  into  the  flow  (for 
example,  change  of  VQ   by  a  value 
  with  in

At  small  values

If the vortical solution is chosen as the initial 
one, then indignations of gas dynamic functions do 
not result in change of the gas dynamic pattern.

In  conclusion  of  this  Section  it  should  be

Figure 11 shows the axial velocity distribution 
for  laminar  and  vortical  solutions  obtained  with 
increasing  heat  release  power  for  this  case.  It 
indicates  that  the  reducing  level  of  heat  release 
disturbance  results  in  essentially  larger  values  of 
the  heat  release  capacity  at  the  transition  from 
laminar  to  vortical  flow.  It  is  reasonable  that  the 
gas  is  heated  up  to  the  large  temperatures.  For 
example,  at  the  greatest  heat  release  capacity

5   Conclusion 
Numerical  investigation  of  subsonic  flows  with 
localized  heat  release  regions  showed  that  at 
certain  conditions  in  gas  flows  it  is  possible  to 
detect  a  bifurcation  of  gas  dynamic  structure. 
two  different  quasi-steady-state  gas 
Namely, 
dynamic configurations at the same initial data do 
exist.

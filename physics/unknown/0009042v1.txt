Excitations  of  a  relativistic  geometry  were  used  to  represent  the  theory  of  quantum
electrodynamics. The connection excitations and the frame excitations reduce, respectively,
to  the  electromagnetic  field  operator  and  electron  field  operator.  Because  of  the  inherent
geometric algebraic structure these operators obey the standard commutation rules of QED.
If we work with excitations, we need to use statistical theory when considering the evolution
of  microscopic  subsystems.  The  use  of  classical  statistics,  in  particular  techniques  of
irreversible thermodynamics, determine that the probability of absorption or emission of a
geometric excitation is a function of the classical energy density. Emission and absorption of
geometric  excitations  imply  discrete  changes  of  certain  physical  variables,  but  with  a
probability  determined  by  its  wave  energy  density.  Hence,  this  geometric  theory  does  not
contradict the fundamental aspects of quantum theory.

Introduction

A geometrical unified theory of gravitation and electromagnetism, which leads to equations of relativistic
quantum mechanics, was shown to imply the quantization of electric charge and magnetic flux [1 ], providing
a plausible explanation for the fractional quantum Hall effect. Furthermore the theory leads to a geometrical
model for the process of field quantization[2 ], implying the existence of fermionic and bosonic operators. We
shall indicate the latter paper by I. Here we discuss whether the theory gives quantum electrodynamics  (QED)
including  its  probabilistic  interpretation.

A basic feature of the proposed theory is non-linearity. A solution cannot be obtained by the addition of
two or more solutions and therefore it is not possible to build exact solutions from small subsystems. Neverthe-
less, it is possible to study its local linearized equations which represent excitations that evolve approximately
under the influence of effects inherited from the nonlinear equation.

Geometric Relations

Product of Jacobi Operators.

The product αβ has been taken in I as the Clifford product. Other candidates  for the ring product were
discussed    in  that  paper.    The  chosen  product  presents  difficulties    when  relating  the  geometry    to  standard
QED.

Since the fiber bundle of frames, E,  is a principal bundle and its vertical  tangent bundle TE has for fiber
a Lie algebra structure inheritted from the group, it would be more natural  that the chosen product be closed
in the algebra so that the result be also  valued in the Lie algebra. Geometrically we should specialize the ring
product  to  be  the  Lie  subproduct.  Then  the  product αβ    is  zero  whenever  its  gradation  is  even.The  bracket
survives only when the commutator is nonzero because its gradation is odd  and corresponds to the commuta-
tor. In other words the ring product obeys
]

    for odd grade   ,
α β• = 0            for even grade   ,
with this product, the bracket defined in I becomes

which is the anticommutator, for  the matter Jacobi operator fields.

The fiber bundle of connections, W, is an affine bundle and the ring product associated to the fiber of TW

is commutative. Therefore, the bracket is the commutator for the connection Jacobi operator fields

If    we  take  Schwingwer’s    action  principle  as  described  in  I,  we  obtain  the  quantization  relations    by

As discussed in previous articles, the Jacobi vectors Vs represent fluctuations of sections of fiber bundles E.
The corresponding jet prolongation  jV  of an extension of Vs is a vector field on JE which acts as an operator on
functions on JE. A Jacobi field, as a vertical vector  on the section s(M) may be considered as a displacement of
s. Similarly, its jet prolongation may be considered as a displacement of js, in other words a variation,

This linear action of the Jacobi fields on the background sections allow us to associate them with quantum
theory objects. We may consider the background section as the state 〉 of the physical system and the Jacobi
fields as physical linear operators Ψ  that naturally act on the states. In this condition the background section

3

remains fixed and the Jacobi operators obey the first order linearized  equations. (Heisenberg picture).

A  given  physical  matter  section  may  be  expressed  in  terms  of  reference  frame  sections.  This  reference
frames are also physical systems . Hence they may evolve under the action of the same group that acts on the
physical sections. This represents the known equivalence of the active and passive views of evolution. We may
consider the physical system evolving in a fixed frame or, equivalently, we may consider the system fixed  in an
evolving  reference frame.

We may choose the reference frame so that the substratum section does not evolve. In this condition the
substratum section remains fixed and the Jacobi operators obey the first order linearized equations of motion.
(Heisenberg picture).

The Jacobi vector fields and their jet prolongations transform under the adjoint representation of the group
that  transforms  the  sections.  We  may  use  these  transformations  to  a  new  reference  frame  where  the  Jacobi
operators do not evolve. In this condition, the time dependence of the Jacobi operators may be eliminated and
the  substratum  sections  obey  equations  of  motion,  indicating  that  the  state  is  time  dependent  (Schroedinger
picture).

Geometric Electrodynamics

Reduction of the electromagnetic sector

In order to get the standard QED from the geometric theory, we have to reduce the structure group to one
of the 3 U(1) subgroups in the SU(2) electromagnetic sector. The corresponding  u(1) component of the fluc-
tuation of the generalized connection is the electromagnetic potential A. Similarly, an electromagnetic fluctua-
tion  of    the  matter  section  determines  a  fluctuation  of  the  generalized  current.  The  standard  QED  electric
current is the electromagnetic sector component of this current fluctuation,

It should be clear that an exact solution of the proposed problem is not possible with this technique, The
reason for this is the presence of the nonlinearity of the self interaction in the equations. We must  consider
approximate solutions. In QED the interaction is imposed  on  special fields called “free fields”. Here we have
to discuss which frame and connection sections  correspond to “free fields”.

It  is  natural  to  consider    a  free  connection  field  as  one  that  satisfies  the  previous  equation  with  j=0.  A
solution  to  the  free  equation  provides  a  background  connection  section  that  can  be  used  with  the  proposed
technique.

The equation of motion

presents the difficulty with the self interaction. It is not possible to set the connection  to zero because it will
automatically eliminate the self energy and the mass parameter  in accordance with our theory. The simplest
approximation  is then to assume that all self interaction effects, to first order, are concentrated in the single
mass parameter. The fluctuation equation is,
κ ∂µ

+  interactions   .

µe me=

It is natural to consider a free frame field  as one that satisfies the previous equation without the interac-
tion  term.  A  solution  to  this  free  equation  provides  a  background  frame  section  that  can  be  used    with  our
technique.  The  linearized  fluctuation  equations,  with  the  interaction  term,  determine  the  fluctuations  of  the
connection and frame fields.

Quantum Electrodynamics

We shall consider that the cause of the fluctuation is the interaction that couples the two free systems. The
two background sections are not a solution to the interacting  system, they are a reference for the method of
approximation. The solution is represented by two sections that deviate (fluctuate) from the background sec-
tions. In other words, there is a fluctuation operator that represents the interaction. This situation corresponds
to an interaction picture in QED. By choosing an appropiate reference frame, the background sections  have
the “free motion” and the fluctuation operators represent the dynamics.

We assumed that the only effect of the self interaction in the free motion of the fields is the mass parameter
m. The remaining effects of the total physical interaction, associated with the flutuation fields, corresponds to
an effective net interaction energy,

energy is not included in the fluctuation and this method (or QED) is not adequate for calculation of mass.

It is known that the Lagrangian for the first variation of the Lagrange equations is the second variation of
the  Lagrangian.  For  both  free  fields,  the  corresponding  second  variation  of  the  Lagrangian  gives  the  free
Maxwell and Dirac fields Lagrangian. For the interaction fields the second variation gives

We  have obtained a framework of linear operators (the prolongations of Jacobi fields) acting on states of
a  Banach  space  (sections  forming  a  Banach  space)  where  the  operators  obey  the  bracket  commutation  rela-
tions,  commutators  for  A  and  anticommutators  for  Ψ.  Furthermore,  the  geometric  Lagrangian  of  the  theory
reduces to  a Lagrangian in terms of operators which is the standard Lagrangian for QED).

From this point we can proceed  using the standard language and notation of QED for any calculation we
wish to carry in this approximation of the geometric theory. The result of the calculation should be interpreted
physically. This is our next task, to give a statistical interpretation to fluctuations in the geometrical  theory.

Statistical interpretation

The physical significance of the local sections in the geometrical theory is the representation of the influ-
ence  of  the  total  universe  of  matter  and  interactions.  The  geometry  of  the  theory,  including  the  notion  of
corpuscles is determined  by the large number of sources in the universe. Within this theory and interpretation,
it is not appropriate to consider the sections to be associated with a single particle or excitation. Rather, they
are associated to the global non-linear geometric effects of bulk matter and radiation.

This is not the customary situation in which physical theories are set. It is usual to postulate fundamental
laws between elementary microscopic objects (particles). In order to translate the global universal geometry to
the usual microscopic  physics, since we associate particles to geometric excitations, we shall stablish what we
call a “many excitation microscopic regime”, distinguished from the situation described in the previous para-
graph.

Statistics enter in our approach in a manner different than the usual one, where fundamental microscopic
physical laws are postulated between idealized elementary particles and statistical analysis enters because of
the difficulties that arise when combining particles to form complex systems. Here, the fundamental laws are
postulated geometrically among  all matter and radiation in the system ( the physical universe) and statistical
analysis  arises because of the difficulties and approximations in splitting the non-linear system into elemen-
tary microscopic linear fluctuation subsystems. In this holistic approach, the results associated to excitations
have the statistical character of quantum theory.

We consider that we may work in two different regimes of the geometrical theory. One is the geometrical
regime where there are exact non-linear equations between the local frame sections, representing matter func-

5

tions, and the bundle connection. The other is the many excitations microscopic regime where we have linear-
ized approximate equations between the variations of the frame and connection sections, representing particles
and fields.

In the many-excitations regime, the non-linear local effects of the interaction are replaced by a linear local
effects for which the systems are seen, approximately, as a collection of excitations of a background solution.
The  number  of  excitations  is  naturally  very  large  and  the  cross  interactions  among  them  preclude  an  exact
treatment for a single excitation. Instead it is necessary to treat the excitations as one among a large ensemble
of excitations leading to a convenient and necessary use of statistical theory.

The geometric excitations form statistical  ensembles of population density ni . It is not possible  to follow
the evolution of any single one because of the previous arguments. It is absolutely necessary to use statistics in
describing the evolution of the excitations. The situation is similar to that of chemical reactions, where mol-
ecules are statistically created or annihilated.

There are adequate classical statistical techniques for describing these processes. In particular we may use
the theory of irreversible thermodynamics [4 ] to calculate the rates of reaction between different geometric
excitations. The process is described by the flux density  characterizing the flow of excitations between two
systems.
 = dn
dt
It is also necessary to introduce a driving force function, ., which is called affinity and represents differ-
ences of thermodynamic intensive parameters. In case of equilibrium between two different subsystems, both
the affinity and the flux are zero.

The identification of the affinity is done by considering the rate of production of entropy s,

where u is the energy, T is the temperature and µ is the excitation potential, similar to the chemical potential.
The  statistical  flux  is  a  function  of  the  affinity    and  we  see  that  the  statistics  of  reaction  of  geometric
excitations should depend on the classical geometric energy of the excitations. If  the excitations are oscilla-
tory, the energy depends on the excitation amplitude. Then the probability of occurrence of a single reaction
event is determined by the excitation potential which in turn depends on the excitation amplitude. These is the
significance of the probabilistic interpretation of  quantum fields.

In some cases, for linear Markoffian systems (systems  whose future is determined by their present and not

their past)  the flux is proportional to the affinity

and the calculation of rates is simplified, indicating explicitly the dependence of the flux on the different of
excitation  potentials.

Applications

In  order  to  illustrate  this  statistical  character  of  the  linearized  regime,  we  discuss  the  wave  corpuscular
duality of light and matter, typically demonstrated in Young’s double slit interference experiment, within the
concepts  of  the  geometric  theory.  There  are  excitations  that  correspond  to  multiple  particles  and  lead  to
Schrödinger’s “entangled states”. There has been a revolution in the experimental preparation of multi article
entanglements [5 ,6 ,7 ,8 ,9 ].  In particular, consider a two-particle interferometer illustrated in figure 1. At the
center there is a source of decaying particles, with a vertical extension d. Two collimating screens, each with a

pair  of  holes,  offer  alternative  paths  to  a  given  pair  of  particles  that  are  finally  detected  in  two  detecting
screens

.   A physical particle (f.e. a photon) is an excitation of the corresponding background field. In geometric
terms,  a  Jacobi vector Ψ, associated to a variation of a section e or ω, represents the particle. As indicated in
the previous section, it is not possible to follow the evolution of a single excitation Ψ. The statistical approach
is  to  treat  the  radiation  as  a  thermodynamic  reservoir  of  excitations  .  This  approach  was  used  in  blackbody
radiation[10 ,11 ,12 ]  and  was  the  origin  of  Planck’s  quantum  theory.  In  recent  years,  a  similar  idea  lead  to
introduction  of  stochastic  quantization  [13 ,14 ],  which  has    been  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  path  integral
quantization.  Our  approach  is  different,  for  example  we  do  not  introduce  evolution  along  a  fictitious  time
direction as done in stochastic quantization. We rely on the existence of a global nonlinear geometry which
makes  a  practical  necessity  the  statistical  treatment  of  the  linearized  equations  describing  the  evolution  of
microscopical subsytems.

The atoms in the screen are an ensemble of systems in contact with the reservoir of radiation. The equilib-
rium of the total system, radiation and screen, is determined by the equality of the excitation potentials associ-
ated to the geometric excitations forming the radiation. When there is no equilibrium there is a flow of excita-
tions  from  the  radiation  to  the  screen.  The  techniques  of  irreversible  thermodynamics  relate  this  excitation
flux density to the affinity, which depends on the differences of the associated excitation potentials. We also
assume that we are dealing with a Markoffian system. This approximation has been used successfully in the
quantum theory of damping [15 ,16 ] for laser systems.

In  order  to  calculate  the  excitation  potential  we  need  to  express  the  energy  in  terms  of  the  number  of
excitations. If  the  electromagnetic  excitation  field  is  expressed,  as  usual  in  terms  of  harmonic  oscillators  at
each  point,  the  oscillator  displacement  (excitation  or  variation  of  the  electromagnetic  field)  is  a  thermody-
namic extensive parameter, x. Associated to it there is an intensive parameter  F that gives the energy change,

As indicated previously, the Jacobi vector Ψ may be decomposed in its Fourier components. The ampli-

N a a
has discrete eigenvalues which determine the energy of the field. It should be clear that because of the commu-
tation relations of the operators a, the energy of the harmonic oscillators corresponding to the excitations is
quantized, with the same results of the quantum theory. The energy of the excitations has quanta of value ν, in
geometric units where (cid:1) equals 1. The radiation field has an amplitude which is modulated throughout certain
space regions because of the interference pattern produced by the waves. This means that the average energy is
not homogeneously distributed but concentrated in certain regions. We should consider a local excitation po-
tential defined within domains of volume, determined by a correlation distance where the density of energy u
may taken as constant. Then the excitation potential is

In our case we have to consider an m-particle wave. To clarify the situation and avoid confusion with the
concept of particle, we define an m-corpuscle excitation as the tensor product representation of m fundamental
(1-corpuscle) representations.The Jacobi excitation field amplitude is then an m-product representation.

In this language, we consider the case of a 2-corpuscle excitation experiment, in particular the case of two
Young’s experiments side by side. We not only have a correlation betweeen alternative paths through A and B
for the right corpuscle  but also correlations among paths A or B and A’ or B’ for the 2-corpuscle excitation
formed by the product of the two 1-corpuscle excitations. If  a particle decays at height x above the center line,
a particle may be detected in the right screen at height y and another in the left screen at height z. The phase

The probability for the simultaneous detection of particles at P an P’ is given by this excitation potential.
There are regions of high and low probabilities because of the interference of  the excitation amplitudes. These
cases just illustrated for 1-particle and 2-particle interferometers give a general characteristic of section exci-
tation in the geometrical theory.  There are no exact equations for physical situations with a single excitation.
Any real physical situation in the microscopic linear regime of the theory requires the use of statistics. The
outcome  of  microscopic  transition  experiments  depends  on  the  excitation  potentials  of  the  systems.  The  re-
quirement of statistics necessarily leads to the probability interpretation of quantum theory. If, within a par-
ticular experimental setup, we can physically  distinguish between two excitation states, there no room to apply
statistics and there follows the absence of the interference pattern. This is the content of Feynman’s statement
about experimentally indistinguishable alternatives [17 ]. Fundamentally the quantum statistics are the classi-
cal statistics  of section excitations in this physical geometry. The objections raised by Einstein to the probabi-
listic interpretation are resolved automatically [18 ,19 ].

Conclusion

Excitations  of  a  physical  geometry  were  used  to  represent  the  theory  of  quantum  electrodynamics.  The
connection excitations and the frame excitations reduce, respectively, to the electromagnetic field operator and
electron field operator. Because of the inherent geometric algebraic structure this operators obey the standard
commutation rules of QED. Use of harmonic analysis introduces creation and annihilation operators for the
associated excitation waves. The energy of the connection excitations is (cid:1)ν.

The  nonlinear  geometric  equations  apply  to  the  total  universe  of  matter  and  radiation.  If  we  work  with
excitations, this implies the need to use statistical theory when considering the evolution of microscopic sub-
systems. The use of classical statistics, in particular techniques of irreversible thermodynamics, determine that
the probability of absorption or emission of a geometric excitation is a function of the classical energy density,
which determines the excitation (chemical) potential.

Emission and absorption of geometric excitations imply discrete changes of certain physical variables, but
with a probability determined by its wave energy density. Hence, this geometric theory does not contradict the
fundamental aspects of quantum theory. On the contrary, it offers a geometrical representation for the exist-
ence of discrete quanta of energy, spin, electric charge and magnetic flux.

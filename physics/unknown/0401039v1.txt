Abstract

Single-shot ultrafast absorbance spectroscopy based on the frequency encoding of the
kinetics is analyzed theoretically and implemented experimentally. The kinetics are sampled in
the  frequency  domain  using  linearly  chirped,  amplified  33  fs  FWHM  pulses  derived  from  a
Ti:sapphire  laser.  A  variable  length  grating  pair  compressor  is  used  to  achieve  the  time
resolution of 500-1000 channels per a 2-to-160 ps window with sensitivity > 5x10-4. In terms of
the acquisition time, FDSS has an advantage over the pump-probe spectroscopy in a situation
when the “noise” is dominated by amplitude variations of the signal, due to the pump and flow
instabilities. The possibilities of FDSS are illustrated with the kinetics obtained in multiphoton
ionization of water and aqueous iodide and one-photon excitation of polycrystalline ZnSe and
thin-film amorphous Si:H. Unlike other “single-shot” techniques, FDSS can be implemented for
fluid samples flowing in a high-speed jet and for thin solid samples that exhibit interference
fringes; no a priori knowledge of the excitation profile of the pump across the beam is needed.
Another advantage is that due to the interference of quasimonochromatic components of the
chirped probe pulse, an oscillation pattern near the origin of the FDSS kinetics emerges. This
pattern  is  unique  and  can  be  used  to  determine  the  complex  dielectric  function  of  the
photogenerated species.

I. INTRODUCTION

Most ultrafast laser spectroscopy experiments are done in a pump-probe fashion:
a short probe pulse is delayed in time and then crossed in the sample with a pump pulse.
The kinetics are obtained by plotting the transmission/reflection of the probe pulse as a
function of the delay time. If the amplitude of the pump-induced kinetics varies from shot
to  shot,  this  variation  translates  into  noise  that  is  spread  across  the  whole  trace.  For
example, in multiphoton ionization, small fluctuations of the pump intensity cause large
variations  in  the  photoinduced  signal.  This  “noise”  may  be  large  even  if  the  transient
absorption  (TA)  itself  is  strong.  Other  common  sources  of  the  "noise"  include  flow
instabilities, thermal lensing, and photodegradation of the sample. The problem is further
exacerbated  when  one  is  interested  in  small  variations  of  a  TA  signal  caused  by  an
external perturbation: an electric or magnetic field, a change in the polarization, a second
(delayed) pump pulse of a different energy, etc. If this perturbation causes a change in the
TA that is smaller than a typical shot-to-shot variation of the signal amplitude, extensive
averaging is needed to extract the data. Last but not least, since the translation stage (used
to  delay  the  pulses  in  time)  is  a  mechanical  device,  it  is  not  uncommon  that  a  large
fraction of the acquisition time, especially in the sub-ns regime, is spent on moving the
stage rather than sampling the data. Most of these problems could be solved if there were
a reliable method for "single-shot" sampling of the kinetics. By that we imply that the
entire kinetic trace is sampled for each probe pulse; still, one may need to average over
many  such  traces  to  obtain  an  acceptable  S/N  ratio.  Since  the  entire  kinetics  are
modulated  in  the  same  way,  shot-to-shot  variations  do  not  produce  "noise"  and  the
averaging efficiency is improved.

Our interest in "single-shot" methodology was instigated by the development of
an ultrafast high energy electron source for radiation chemistry studies at Argonne. Short
(0.5-2 ps) pulses of energetic (1-20 MeV) electrons are ejected from a supersonic helium
jet irradiated by >1018 W/cm2, 25-35 fs FWHM light pulses. Due to the high power load
on  the  amplification  optics,  the  repetition  rate  is  low,  5-10  Hz  (which  is  already  a
dramatic improvement on < 1 mHz rate achieved elsewhere). 1 Owing to large shot-to-
shot  variations  in  the  yield  of  electrons  and  the  low  repetition  rate,  pump-probe
methodology is unsuited for this kind of pump source.

Two  approaches  for  "single-shot"  ultrafast  spectroscopy  have  been  previously
suggested:  (i)  spatial  encoding  and  (ii)  frequency  encoding.  The  former  method  was
proposed in 1970 by Rentzepis and co-workers 2,3 and further developed by Nelson and
co-workers. 4,5,6  The method is similar in principle to the one used in frequency-resolved
optical gating (FROG) devices. 7 In a typical setup,  4,5 cylindrically focussed pump and
probe beams are crossed in the sample, and the transmitted probe and reference beams
are  imaged  on  a  CCD.  Since  the  arrival  time  of  the  probe  pulse  at  the  sample
continuously  changes  across  the  beam  (on  a  sub-ps  time  scale),  the  pump  and  probe
collide  at  different  times  and  this  "imprints"  the  kinetics  on  the  axial  profile  of
transmitted light. The spread of the delay times can be increased further out to 10-15 ps
by  passing  the  probe  (and/or  the  pump)  beam  through  an  echelon  3.6  or  a  supersonic
beam.  8 Transient absorption, 2,4,5,6 stimulated emission, 3 and grating 5 measurements on

3

picosecond  (ps)  2,3  and  femtosecond  (fs)  4.5  time  scales  have  been  carried  out  in  this
manner.  A  more  sophisticated  version  of  the  same  technique  employs  two  crossed
echelons to generate a 2D train of probe pulses separated by 30 fs in time that extends out
to 10 ps; a CCD is used to analyze the resulting 2D pattern. 6  While spatial encoding may
work  for  some  applications,  there  are  several  drawbacks  that  make  this  technique
unsuitable for time resolved radiation chemistry:

First, it is almost impossible to extend the time window of the observation beyond
the first 10-15 ps. Second, refraction of the probe and pump beams, by liquid jets and
thermal lenses, is a serious concern, as it destroys the pattern. For thin films, interference
of the probe beam in the sample ruins the spatio-temporal correlation, and there are no
examples of using the technique for samples thinner than 100 µm. Third, to obtain the
spatial profile of the probe beam, one needs to know the spatial profile of photogenerated
species, 4,5 as it is the product of these two profiles that is registered by the CCD. To this
end, a separate experiment with a calibrated sample is needed to obtain the pump beam
profile. 4 However, if the photon order of the excitation is not known beforehand or the
excitation is mixed order, as often is the case, the knowledge of such a profile would be
of  little  use.  Finally,  in  radiation  chemistry  applications,  it  is  impossible  to  focus  the
ultrashort pulse of relativistic electrons cylindrically or delay this pulse in time without
substantial increase in its pulse duration, due to the energy spread. From the engineering
prospective, spatio-temporal encoding requires extremely high quality of the light beams
and close placement of the detector to the sample, which makes it almost impossible to
implement this method in the confined space of a vacuum chamber.

The second technique, frequency encoding, is based on introducing linear chirp
(frequency-dependent phase) in the probe pulse. 9,10  As a result, the blue light component
of  the  probe  pulse  arrives  at  the  sample  at  a  different  delay  time  than  the  red  light
component, and the kinetics is imprinted in the spectrum of the transmitted probe pulse,
with  the  "delay  time"  equal  to  the  group  delay  at  a  given  frequency.  10 Frequency
encoding has been used for "single-shot" temporal and spatio-temporal characterization
of short light 11,12 and free electron 13 pulses, correlation spectroscopy, 14 holography, 15a
interferometry, 16,17 electro-optic measurements of THz pulses, 15b etc. Furthermore, this
encoding  is  implicit  in  the  pump-probe  spectroscopies  that  use  chirped  laser  pulses,
including several variants of transient absorption, 18.19 reflection, 19 interferometry, 17 and
4-wave mixing  20. Nevertheless, we are aware of only one previous work  10    in which
frequency  encoding  was  used  for  "single-shot" frequency domain  detection  of  the  TA
kinetics.  In  1992,  Beddard  et  al.  10 selected  a  600-650  nm  pulse  from  white  light
supercontinuum and stretched it to 8-20 ps using a 0.5-2.5 m single mode optical fiber.
This chirped probe pulse was used to study the bleaching of a malachite green dye in an
alcohol solution. TA kinetics that exhibited the S/N ratio of 100:1 for a 10-2  bleaching
signal were obtained. When the 625 nm pump pulse was shortened from 500 fs to 250 fs
FWHM, an oscillatory pattern superimposed on the kinetics emerged. Beddard et al.  10
interpreted these oscillations as nonlinear interference effects; in fact, as shown in section
2,  these  oscillations  are  the  inherent  feature  of  the  frequency-domain  "single-shot"
(FDSS)  spectroscopy.  Rather  than  being  detrimental,  these  oscillation  carry  the
information  on  the  phase  of  the  complex  dielectric  function  (similar  to  the  way  the
chirped-pulse nonlinear refraction spectroscopy does) 19 which thereby can be retrieved.

4

In  the  decade  that  passed  after  the  initial  experiments  of  Beddard  et  al.,  1 0
generation  of  ultrashort  pulses  using  chirped-pulse  amplification  (CPA)  with  grating
stretchers  and  compressors  became  routine.  9   These  days,  there  is  no  need  to  use
divergent, low-quality white light supercontinuum pulses for FDSS since femtosecond
pulses  derived  from  an  amplified  Kerr-lens  mode-locked  Ti:sapphire  laser  already
provide  the  bandwidth  that  is  optimum  for  FDSS  measurements.  Due  to  their  high
quality, these fs pulses can be negatively chirped using grating compressors that provide
group velocity dispersion up to a few ps2.  9  As argued in section III.1, with the typical
compressor designs that are used for CPA, "single-shot" kinetic measurements over 300-
500 ps are possible.

With these developments, what was exotic in 1992 has a potential to become a
mainstream  technique.  In  this  work,  we  showcase  FDSS  for  several  photosystems,
including a 2 mm thick polycrystalline ZnSe sample (section V.1), a 1.4 µm thin film of
amorphous Si:H alloy (Appendix 2), aqueous sodium iodide (flowed in a glass cell and a
high-speed jet) from which a hydrated electron is detached after absorption of two 400
nm photons (section V.2), and liquid water (flowed in a 150 µm thick high-speed jet)
ionized by absorption of three 400 nm photons (section V.3). It is shown that the FDSS
technique can be carried out on the time scales ranging from 2 to 160 ps and (a) yields 5-
10 times better S/N ratio than pump-probe spectroscopy (PPS) for the same acquisition
time, (b) suitable both for thick and thin samples, (c) can be used to study both the static
and flowing samples, and (d) yields information on nonlinear refraction in addition to
transient  absorption.  We  describe  a  FDSS  setup  based  on  a  variable-length  grating
compressor, in which the sandard instrumentation for spectral analysis is used (section
IV). The proposed FDSS technique bypasses most of the problems associated with the
spatial encoding and is easy to implement experimentally, as most of the components are
already used for CPA (sections III and IV).

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  In  section  II  and  Appendix  1,  we  give  a
theoretical analysis of the FDSS technique. The requirements of the detection system and
optics used for pulse chirping are scrutinized in section III. The details of a hybrid PPS-
FDSS setup built in our laboratory are given in section IV. In section V and Appendix 2,
FDSS kinetics for the selected photosystems are examined and compared to PPS kinetics
obtained  using  the  same  hybrid  setup.  In  section  VI,  the  insights  obtained  in  these
experiments are summarized and the advantages and disadvantages of FDSS technique in
our implementation are discussed. To save space, some figures (referred to in the text as,
for example, Fig. 1S) and Appendices 1 and 2 are placed in Part II of this paper.

II. THEORY

Our  treatment  is  similar  in  approach  to  the  previous  analyses  of  chirped  pulse
pump-probe TA spectroscopy 18,19 and interferometry; 17 however, it departs from these
in more than one respect. Taking ∆ω=ω-ω0 as the frequency offset for the probe pulse,
the Fourier transform Eω of the electric field E(t) for a chirped Gaussian pulse centered at
ω0 is given by

In the following, we will assume that the pump and the probe photons have vastly
different energies and neglect coherent contributions to the TA signal, 21 as we are mainly
interested in the dynamics that occur at delay times that are several times longer than the
duration of the pump pulse. See ref. 18 for a more accurate derivation (for chirped pulse
PPS)  that  takes  into  account  both  the  sequential  and  Raman  terms.  2 1    With  our
assumptions, the energy of the probe pulse absorbed in a thin sample of width d is given

Since  both  parameters  α  and  β    are  complex  functions  of  ω, S(ω)  strongly
oscillates near the kinetics origin, where Te=0 (the real and complex parts of function Φ

10    The oscillations are stronger for smaller τL and δ, whereas longer pump pulses and
lower  spectral  resolution  damp  these  oscillations  (see  below).  To  characterize  the
oscillation pattern, we will assume that T=τL=0 and |s|>>1. Then, for γ=0 (a step-like

Thus,  the  oscillation  patterns  for  photoinduced  absorption  (φε=π/2)  and  (nonlinear)
refraction (φε=0) are quite different, both in their phase (eqs. (22)) and in the oscillation
frequency (eq. (24) and Fig. 2). Since the error function becomes real for long "delay
times" Te, for φε=0  the nonlinear refraction contribution S(ω) tends to zero (the upper
traces  in  Figs.  1  and  2).  Thus,  S(ω)  is  sensitive  to  nonlinear  refraction  only  near  the
kinetics origin, where Te=0. To see how the finite spectral resolution causes damping of
S(ω), consider the case when the decay kinetics Γ(t) is so fast that one lets γ→∞. In this
case, we obtain

In general, function Φ(α,β,γ) must be evaluated numerically. This can be done by
splicing a series expansion (for small |z|) and a continued fraction expansion (for large
|z|) for the generalized error function  eerfc(z) = exp(z ) erfc(z) 
 (eqs. 7.1.8 and 7.1.14 in

10

ref.  22).  In  our  simulations,  200-500  terms  were  retained  in  both  of  the  expansions.
Alternatively, the integral in eq. (12) was evaluated numerically on a grid of (1-5)x103
frequency points. The latter method allows including higher dispersion orders, spectral
truncation, etalon effects, etc.

Fig. 3 shows the real part of function Φ (eq. (14)) for several stretch factors s,
pump  pulse  widths  τL,  and  spectral  resolution  parameters  δ  (Fig.  2).  For  picosecond
kinetics (s=100), 30-50% of the time window is taken by the oscillation pattern; for larger
GVD,  this  fraction  decreases  as  s-1/2.  The  observed  trends  agree  with  the  qualitative
analysis  given  above  and  the  results  in  section  V.2.  Fig.  5  shows  the  progression  of
signals  S(ω)  as  a  function  of  the  phase  φe  for  ∆n
) .  Observe  how  the
oscillation pattern near the kinetic origin changes with the phase; this may be used to
estimate φe from the general shape of the oscillatory pattern (section V.1). For ∆nω that
spectrally evolves in time this pattern reflects the average phase over a period of time
∼τ
GVD. By changing GVD, one can obtain the time dependence of this average phase.

III. EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS.

1. Chirping the probe pulse.

As  compared  to  CPA,  FDSS  sets  very  low  constraints  on  the  compressor  or
stretcher used to chirp the probe pulse. In the usual CPA scheme, 9  a short pulse from the
oscillator is stretched, amplified, and then recompressed, so that the positive chirp added
by the stretcher (and the amplifier optics) is cancelled by the negative chirp added by the
compressor.  Therefore,  to  obtain  a  transform  limited,  ultrashort  pulse,  this  scheme
requires compensation of third (TOD) and higher order dispersion. In the FDSS, TOD
and the higher orders are unimportant because for the standard beam geometry, a grating
compressor/stretcher cannot introduce sufficiently large TOD to cause notable distortion
of the kinetics. For a single round-trip between the pair of parallel gratings, the GVD is

Since ∆ωτp<1 in the optimum spectral range (eq. (28)), the correction to the second term
of eq. (32) does not exceed (1-2)×(ω0τp)-1 - which is at most a few per cent. Fig. 6a shows
a simulation of S(ω) as a function of Te defined by eq. (17) for ξ3=-1.6 (that corresponds
to the Littrow angle dispersion of 800 nm probe light by a 1200 g/mm grating in the first
diffraction  order).  While  the  TOD  shifts  the  kinetic  origin,  the  change  in  the  kinetic
profile  is  very  slight.  This  small  change  can  be  completely  eliminated  by  plotting  the
kinetics as a function of the group delay Te defined by eq. (32), as shown in Fig. 6b.

Another point is that the probe beam dispersed on the grating can be clipped. In
CPA, the spectral wings cannot be clipped because the high-frequency components must
be added to prevent oscillations of the compressed pulse in the time domain. By contrast,
in  FDSS,  the  kinetics  are  imprinted  in  the  central  section  of  the  probe  spectrum  and
Fourier  components  outside  this  section  do  not  matter.  To  demonstrate  this  point,  we
used eq. (12) to calculate S(ω) for a probe pulse whose Gaussian spectrum was truncated
at  ∆ω
p (Fig. 7). It is clear from this calculation that the effect of truncation is
limited to narrow regions near the truncation points. This is explained as follows:

and for τL=100 fs pump and τp=20 fs probe the Gaussian envelope is 160 cm-1 FWHM. If
the kinetic origin is removed from the truncation points by that much, the cutoff has no
effect  on  the  oscillation  pattern.  In  general,  the  effect  of  limiting  µ  to  a  range  of

increases α2 (given by eqs. (15) and (20)) by Μ -2. For instance, a bandpass of ±10 cm-1 is
equivalent to increasing τL to 1 ps. Thus, a few picoseconds away from the kinetic origin,
the  truncation  of  the  probe  pulse  has  no  effect  since  a  very  narrow  band  of  the
frequencies Ω contributes to S(ω) in the first place. Only for very low GVD (s of ±(10-
50)) can the truncation distort the kinetics. However, for those GVD's, the spread of the
beam  on  the  gratings  is  small  and  no  clipping  occurs  anyway.  This  consideration
indicates  that  once  the  kinetic  origin  is  removed  by  100-200  cm-1  from  the  clipping
points, the kinetics (including the oscillation pattern) do not change at all.

We conclude that for the same stretch factor s, the gratings in the FDSS setup can
be placed 3-5 times further away than the gratings in the equivalent CPA design. A τp=20
fs  (33  fs  FWHM),  800  nm  pulse  from  a  Ti:sapphire  oscillator  yields  the  optimum
sampling interval (eq. (29)) of ±250 cm-1. Simple estimates show that for the standard
1200  g/mm  (θL=  28.7o),  11  cm  -  wide  reflection  grating  used  in  the  first  order,  the
distance Lg can be increased to 1.5-2 m without adverse effects on the FDSS kinetics: For
θ=40o and Lg=1 m, φ"(ω0)=-3 ps2 (s=-7,650, ξ3=1.34), and the ±250 cm-1 interval would

12

be dispersed over 4.5 cm. This calculation suggests that with the standard equipment, one
can sample the kinetics over 300-500 ps.

It may occur that the use of smaller stretch factors (<103) and longer probe pulses
(> 200 fs) might be preferable to compressing a 10-50 fs pulse by a large factor of -(1-
10)x103, as done in our experiments (section IV). Since the oscillations take  ≈ −s 1 2/
 of the
total kinetics regardless of the probe pulse width, larger GVD and shorter pulses actually
yield  "cleaner"  TA  traces,  even  for  relatively  long  sampling  times.  Furthermore,
resolving the oscillation pattern requires short pump pulses and, therefore, short probe
pulses. In the end, the main (perhaps, the only) advantage of longer probe pulses is the
possibility of stretching these pulses with optical fibers.

Since  the  spectral  range  and  resolution  are  fixed,  to  obtain  the  kinetics  on
different time scales, GVD must be tuned – ideally, over the widest possible range (see,
for  example,  section  V.2).  To  this  end,  a  variable-length  grating  compressor  is  best
suited.  In  our  design  (section  IV),  the  compression  factor  is  changed  by  fixing  the
retroreflector RR2 (Fig. 8) and sliding grating GR2 using a 70 cm path translation stage
(TS1). Though we used gold gratings, less expensive aluminum gratings can be used, as
large power losses can be tolerated due to high intensity of the probe light. For the same
reason, higher diffraction orders m can be used to increase GVD without changing Lg (eq.
(30)).  Since  it  is  impossible  to  place  large  reflection  gratings  (needed  to  obtain  large
GVD)  closer  than  15-20  cm,  an  equivalent  positive  chirp  was  introduced  prior  to  the
compression. In our system, the probe pulse is taken from the amplified 800 nm light
dispersed  using  an  Lg=40  cm  grating  stretcher  and  then  negatively  chirped  using  a
variable-length  compressor  (Fig.  8).  A  separate  fixed-length  compressor  is  used  to
generate a transform-limited, amplified 800 nm pulse that provides the pump light (Fig.
8). This scheme allows for continuous change in the probe GVD between 0 and -1.6 ps2.

Alternative schemes for obtaining low stretch factors (102-103) include the use of
transmission gratings (that can be put close to each other and, thereby, give the widest
dynamic  range),  23   dispersive  materials  (such  as  SF18  glass),  9  and  optical  fibers
(especially for visible light). 10  For instance, SF18 glass has GVD of 1540 fs2/cm at 800
nm (s=+3.85/cm, ξ3=0.5)  9  and the stretch factor of +100 can be achieved by passing a
transform limited probe pulse through 25 cm of this material. Beddard et al. 10  used a 2.5
m  long  single  mode  optical  fiber  to  obtain  the  GVD  of  0.14  ps2  to  perform  their  first
FDSS experiment. Thus, one can envision a hybrid system where low (positive) stretch
factors are obtained by using dispersive materials whereas large (negative) compression
factors are obtained using compressors with reflection grating.

The greatest inconvenience  presented  by  the  FDSS  technique  is  that  the  probe
color cannot be easily tuned. The most popular method for varying the probe wavelength
is by generation of white light supercontinuum and using narrow band interference filters
to select a wavelength range. The supercontinuum is nonlinearly chirped, with a typical
stretch factor of 20-100. Due to large beam divergence, it is difficult to compress these
pulses using a gratings compressor (although, low GVD can be obtained by dispersion in
a  fiber).  10.18   Thus,  one  is  forced  to  use  optical  parametric  amplifiers  (OPA's)  as  the
source of coherent probe light. Furthermore, the compressor must be realigned for each

13

probe color (due to the need to keep the incident angle reasonably close to the Littrow
angle). While this operation can be automated, it is difficult to avoid large changes in the
stretch factor since  s ∝ λ3(eq. (30)). A change-over from 800 nm to 400 nm decreases
GVD by an order of magnitude. With the exception of low GVD's, this decrease cannot
be  compensated  by  the  equivalent  increase  in  Lg.  Also,  for  λ  other than the oscillator
wavelength there is no built-in source of stretched probe pulses, and the dynamic range is
reduced.

It should be stressed that most of these problems present themselves for shorter
wavelengths;  for  longer  wavelengths,  the  change-over  is  less  problematic.  Even  for
shorter wavelengths, a ready solution exists provided that the probe beam is sufficiently
bright to tolerate losses that occur when the gratings are used in the higher diffraction
order. A typical OPA yields 2-10 µJ of the VIS light, whereas less than 1 nJ is needed to
probe the sample. For a given groove spacing, the number of possible orders m (given by
< 2) increases as 1/λ whereas GVD increases as m2, and the loss of GVD at the
λ/ dg
shorter wavelengths can be compensated by increasing  m. E. g., for the standard 1200
g/mm grating compressor, 4 diffraction orders exist at 400 nm, and the Littrow angle for
the third order is still acute, ca. 46o. With this grating used in the 2nd and 3d orders, the
GVD at 400 nm is 0.5 and 2.3 times that at 800 nm in the first order. The chart shown in
Fig. 3S helps to choose the optimum Lg and m to obtain a desirable stretch factor s for a
given  wavelength  λ,  for  a  33  fs  FWHM  pulse  and  1200  g/mm  grating  (of  the  fixed
width).

2. The spectrum of the probe pulse.

While the theoretical treatment of section II is formulated for an ideal Gaussian
pulse, the spectra of probe pulses obtained using CPA (before or after the compression)
often exhibit low-amplitude “ripple” (2-10%) juxtaposed on the Gaussian profile. The
origin of this “ripple” can be traced to etalon and aperture effects during the passage of
the  beam  through  the  amplification  optics  and  to  the  modes  of  Ti:sapphire  oscillator
itself.  While  this  “ripple”  is  reduced  when  the  beam  passes  through  a  compressor,  it
reappears as the probe light is diffracted by the sample and the focussing optics. Due to
this diffraction, the amplitude of the “ripple” is not uniform across the beam; the central
part exhibits 2-3 times stronger oscillations than the outer part. A typical slit opening of
the  monochromator  needed  to  obtain  1-5  cm-1  resolution  is  50-100  µm  and,  in  the
absence of a diffuser, it is the central part of the beam that is imaged on the detector.
Since the reference and signal beams travel different paths and are diffracted differently,
their “ripple” patterns are not identical. While most of the “ripple” is divided out by the
normalization  of  the  signal  spectrum  by  the  reference  spectrum,  better  results  are
obtained when a diffuser (DF in Fig. 8) is inserted to homogenize the light. Though the
“ripple” pattern is still observed, close semblance between the “ripple” patterns for the

The last approximation in eq. (35) is justified by the fact that offsetting the coefficient β

is  equivalent  to  a  shift  of  the  delay  time  T  of  the  pump  by  ω

correction relative to the characteristic time τ

We conclude that the high-frequency “ripple” is inconsequential; at most, it adds a small
shift to the phase  φε of  ∆ηω.

3. Monochromator and detector.

max

τ

/≈ 1

Since  a  monochromator  grating  can  always  be  chosen  so  that  ∆ω

p   is
several times smaller than the spacing between the next diffraction orders, the use of low-
density  gratings  in  the  higher  order  may  be  preferable  to  the  use  of  high-resolution
spectrometers  with  long  focal  distances  and/or  high-density  gratings.  Although  the
diffraction in higher order lowers the throughput, that rarely constitutes a problem unless
white  light  supercontinuum  is  used  (section  III.2).  Because  the  dispersion  increases
linearly  with  the  diffraction  order  m,  changing  the  order  allows  one  to  change  the
resolution power of the spectrometer without any other adjustments. Such flexibility is
lacking for high-resolution spectrometers in which high-density gratings are used in the
first  order  (as  is  done  in  most  experiments).  With  our  ƒ=27  cm  Czerny-Turner
monochromator  (SPEX  model  270M)  equipped  with  a  150  g/mm  ruled  grating  (4 µm
blaze), the spectral resolution δ of 2-5 cm-1 (and dispersion of 3.1 nm/mm) in the eighth
order  was  readily  achievable  for  a  50-200  µm  slit  opening.  For  this  order,  the  entire
spectrum of a 33 fs FWHM pulse covers less than 20% of the angle between the orders.
Equally good results were obtained using the same monochormator equipped with a 1200
g/mm grating (500 nm blaze) in the first order.

A  typical  multichannel  analyzer  has  500-1000  pixels  over  the  flat  field  of  the
imaging  spectrograph  with  a  spacing  of  20-25  µm  per  channel.  In  our  setup,  a

15

thermoelectrically cooled 512 channel dual diode array (Princeton Instruments DIDA512
with 14 dynamic bits) was used. The signal on the diode array saturates at relatively high
photon flux (> 108 photons per pixel), and the digitization of the signal is more accurate
as compared to a typical CCD (that saturates at < 106 photons per pixel). On the other
hand,  the  discharge  of  holding  capacitors  on  a  CCD  takes  <  1  ms  vs.  40  ms  on  the
intensified diode array, so the duty cycle is better on a CCD. These two factors balance
each other at high repetition rates (1 kHz); for a low repetition rate (tens of Hz), the diode
array has a clear advantage. For our 1 kHz Ti:sapphire system, typical duty cycle of the
detector was 70%, with 60 ms exposure to the laser light per digitized frame. 5-10 such
frames were averaged, and the series with the pump pulse off and on were alternated. A
mechanical  shutter  (SH2  in  Fig.  8)  was  used  to  block  the  pump  light.  The  ratii  of  the
probe  and  the  reference  signals  were  calculated  for  each  acquisition  channel,  and  the
"pump  on"  ratii  were  normalized  by 
to  obtain
the  "pump  off"  ones 
∆OD
≈
)
 for each channel. 100-500 such “on/off” series were
averaged to obtain the kinetic profiles shown in section V. Before the experiment, “pump
on” and “pump off” dark signals (with the probe light blocked by another shutter (SH1 in
Fig. 8) were collected and subtracted from the spectra. In a typical “blank” experiment
with  the  pump  beam  blocked,  the  “on”  and  “off”  series  for  the  total  of  3x104  pulses
converged to a "∆OD" of 2x10-5, the standard deviation across the spectrum of 5x10-4;
the "on" and "off" ratii were linearly correlated with ρ2=0.9996. To estimate the flatness
of the spectral response, a 1 mm thick 60% pass neutral density filter was periodically
inserted into the “signal” beam using a motorized flipper mount (New Focus model 8892-
K);  the  response  was  flat  within    ±3%  across  the  spectrum.  Similar  estimates  were
obtained by insertion of a pellicle beam splitter and a 150 µm thick flat glass plate, from
a fit to the observed interference pattern. It is difficult to improve on the flatness of the
response due to the dispersion of probe light in the focussing optics and the sample.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL.

The diagram of the setup is shown in Fig. 8. The pump and probe pulses were
derived  from  a  femtosecond  CPA  system:  A  diode-pumped  Nd:YVO  laser  (Coherent
Verdi, 5W) was used to pump Kerr lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser operating at 80
MHz (Spectra Physics Tsunami 3941). Single pulses were selected with a Pockels cell
(Medox) and subsequently stretched to 80 ps in a 1200 g/mm grating stretcher. These 2
nJ  pulses  were  then  amplified  to  0.7  mJ  and  then  to  4  mJ  in  a  two-stage  multipass
Ti:sapphire amplifier pumped with 8.5 mJ and 20 mJ light from diode-pumped Nd:YLF
lasers (Spectra Physics Evolution 10 W and 30 W, respectively). The repetition rate of
the amplifier was 1 kHz and the pulse to pulse stability was typically 3%.

The output from the amplifier was split 1:20 using a glass wedge. The main part
of the beam was passed through a 1200 g/mm grating compressor that yielded Gaussian
probe pulses of 50 fs FWHM and 3 mJ centered at 800 nm. These pulses were delayed
using  a  retroreflector  RR1  on  a  double  path  99  cm  motorized  translation  stage  TS2
(Unislide model ZB40395J with a Velmex 86mm-2 controller) and doubled in frequency
using a 400 µm Type I BBO (β-BaB2O4) crystal (SHG in Fig. 8). The typical maximum
output of the 400 nm light was 80 µJ (100-200 fs FWHM). The 400 nm light was passed
through a couple of narrow band 800 nm mirrors to remove the fundamental; in some

16

instances, a small chirp on the pump pulse was introduced (to increase the product yield)
by placing a 3 mm thick blue-green filter.

The probe pulse (800 nm, 10 mm diameter) was derived from the same amplifier
output and chirped using a variable length compressor (1200 g/mm) with gold reflecting
gratings.  To  this  end,  the  larger  (11  cm  wide)  grating  GR2  was  mounted  on  a  76  cm
translation stage TS1 (Unislide model ZB253002J with a Compumotor S6 drive). An 18
cm wide, gold roof reflector (RR2) was fixed behind the smaller (6 cm wide) stationary
grating (GR1). Note that this reflector should be sufficiently wide to compensate for the
shift of the beam as GR2 is translated. The angle of incidence on GR1 for the 800 nm
beam was 45o. In our design, the Fourier transform limited pulse was obtained for GR2
positioned 5 cm from the end of the stage, which gave us 55 cm of the slanted distance Lg
for  compression.  The  spectrum  of  the  compressed  beam  was  continuously  monitored
using Ocean Optics model S2000 miniature fiber optics spectrometer (FBO) with a 1200
g/mm grating (0.3 nm FWHM resolution).

To  characterize  the  chirp,  the  compressed  probe  beam  was  diverted  with  a
dielectric mirror on a flip mount FM1 and used for autocorrelation using a 90 µm thin
BBO crystal. A 20 mm path Melles Griot Nanomotion II stage was used to delay the 800
nm beam in one of the arms. A fast 1P28 photomultiplier (RCA) operated at -700 V was
used to detect the 400 nm light from the BBO crystal; this signal was sampled using a 10
ns  gated  SR250  boxcar  integrator.  The  photomultiplier  was  used  since  for  large
compression  factors,  the  intensity  of  the  doubled  frequency  pulses  was  too  low  for  a
photodiode. The pulse width of the compressed pulse obtained using this autocorrelator
was in good agreement with the value estimated from the known τp (obtained from the
spectrum width of the probe pulse) and GVD calculated using eq. (30). The calculated
GVD was also in good agreement with the value obtained from eq. (17). For the latter
calibration, the delay time of the pump pulse T was incremented and the spectral shift of
the kinetic origin for a photoinduced signal measured; the ratio of these two increments
gives the GVD.

The  main  part  of  the  compressed  beam  was  passed  through  a  50%  glass  beam
splitter (BS). One beam was used as a reference, another as a probe. A notch filter (NF)
on a translation stage was placed before a 50% beam splitter to match the spectra of the
two beams on the diode array (section III.3). Before the beam splitter BS, the 800 nm
beam was passed through a 2-3 mm aperture (A) and attenuated down to < 1 nJ with a
variable neutral density filter. To eliminate the possibility of coherent artifacts, the pump
and  probe  pulses  were  perpendicularly  polarized.  The  800  and  400  nm  beams  were
) and overlapped in the sample
focused with achromatic lenses L1 and L2 ( f
(SM) at 6.5o. The transmitted probe was collimated using a thin lens L3, and the "signal"
and  "reference"  beams  were  used  for  either  the  standard  pump-probe  or  for  FDSS
detection; dielectric mirrors on the flip mounts FM2 and FM3 were used to divert the
beams to either one of the detection systems. In the pump-probe configuration, the signal
and  the  reference  signals  were  detected  with  fast  silicon  photodiodes  PD1  and  PD2
(EG&G FND-100Q biased at 90 V), amplified to 5 V, shaped to 1 µs width (using an
EG&G 142A preamplifier and an EG&G 855 spectroscopy amplifier), and sampled with
home-built sample-and-hold electronics. A Power Mac G3 computer was used to digitize
the amplified diode signals using a 16 bit A/D converter (National Instruments PCI-MIO-
16XE-50)  and  to  control  the  diode  array,  shutters  SH1  and  SH2    (Uniblitz  model

= 30  

cm

17

VS25S2ZMO), and the delay stages. A mechanical chopper (THz Technologies model C-
980)  locked  at  50%  repetition  rate  of  the  laser  was  used  to  block  the  pump  pulses  on
alternative  shots  (this  chopper  was  removed  for  FDSS  measurements).  The  standard
deviation for a single-pulse pump-probe measurement was typically 10-3, and the "noise"
in the PPS kinetics was entirely dominated by the variation of the pump intensity and
flow instabilities.

In the FDSS experiment, the probe and reference 800 nm beams were focussed on
a diffuser (DF) that was placed 2-5 mm before the monochromator slit with a ƒ=30 cm
cylindrical lens (CL). See section III.3 for more detail on the acquisition methodology.
Since  nearly  perfect  wavelength  correspondence  between  the  signal  and  the  reference
signals is essential, the following alignment procedure was used: A notch filter NF (CVI
model  FI.5-794.7-0.5)  centered  at  794.2  nm  with  a  1.97  nm  FWHM  Lorentzian
transmission profile was placed before the beams were split, and the spectra (dispersed
over 150-200 photodiodes) fit with a Lorentzian. By moving the beams, the centroids and
the widths of the two Lorenzians were matched to 0.4-1 pixels. The spectral resolution
was determined in a separate experiment by observing the 546.1 nm mercury line.

Materials.

A  3o  angle,  2  mm  thin  wedge  of  uncoated  polycrystalline  ZnSe
with  surface  flatness  of  ±0.25  µm  was  obtained  from  Janos  Technology,  Inc.  (part
A1505W129). A 1.4 µm thick film of undoped amorphous (a-) Si:H alloy (8 at. % of H)
deposited  on  1  mm  suprasil  substrate  was  obtained  from  Prof.  H.  Fritzsche  of  the
University of Chicago (see ref. 24 for more detail). Nanopure water with resistance > 10
M Ω   was  used  in  the  experiments  with  liquid  samples;  analytical  grade  NaI
(Mallinckrodt) was used in the experiments on electron photodetachment from I-.  The
experiments were carried out either with a 160 µm thick, 6 mm wide laser jet or 5 mm
optical path suprasil flow cell. In the latter case, the pump and probe beams were crossed
in  the  middle  of  the  cell,  to  avoid  burning  the  glass  walls.  In  both  cases,  the  linear
velocity of the fluid was > 1 m/s. 25  All measurements were carried out at 295 K.

V. PHOTOSYSTEMS.

1. Polycrystalline ZnSe.

ZnSe is a II-VI semiconductor with an optical gap of 2.67 eV. 26-29 This material
strongly absorbs light with λ<550 nm but is transparent at 800 nm (60% transmission for
the refraction index η of ca. 2.5). 28  On the ns time scale, nonlinear refraction index and
TA for ZnSe were studied using Z-scan and 4-wave mixing spectroscopies that utilized
532  nm  and  1064  nm  probe  pulses.  28  More  recently,  ultrafast  time-resolved  Z-scan
spectroscopy has been carried out in the pump-probe fashion. 26,27  These data suggest that
on the ps-to-ns time scales, ∆η is negative and dominated by free-carrier refraction; the
positive signal due to the thermal effect is small. 27,28  Within the duration of a below-the-
gap  532  nm  pump  pulse,  ∆η   is  dominated  by  a  short-lived  positive  bound-electron
contribution;  this  contribution  is  lacking  for  above-the-gap  excitation  with  a  395  nm
pump.  27  For the latter, ∆η<0  for all delay times and the refraction signal from the free
carriers  decays  biexponentially,  with  the  time  constants  of  7  and  63  ps.  27  The  slow

18

component is due to the charge recombination; the fast component is due to the trapping
of the free carriers by defects and impurity. The same two components were observed
using time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. 27  The thermalization of free carriers is
much faster than either one of these two processes. 27,28 For n-type ZnSe film excited with
420-480  nm  photons,  relaxation  times  of  0.5  and  1.8  ps  were  obtained  for  electron
relaxation  by  emission  of  LO  phonons  and  intervalley  scattering,  respectively.  29  A
differential reflectance measurement for 400 nm photoexcitation also gave 0.44 ps for the
electron relaxation. 30  Thus, we may safely assume that the oscillation pattern of S(ω) for
Te<10 ps is dominated by negative nonlinear refraction from thermalized photocarriers.
For these carriers, we may use a simple Drude model 31,32 with

m*=0.12  m e  is  the  reduced  effective  mass  of  the  carriers.  28   From  eq.  (36),  we
immediately  obtain  that  cot φ ωτ
D.  Since  the  oscillation  pattern  of  S(ω)  uniquely
depends  on  the  phase  φε   (section  II),  FDSS  measurement  yields  τD without  separate
measurements  of  the  absorption  and  refraction  in  the  photoexcited  sample.  Note  that
common pump-probe approaches to the measurement of φε  would be (i) the combination
of transmission and reflection measurements, 31,1S (ii) the combination of two reflection
measurements at different angles of incidence, 32 and (iii) time-resolved interferometry. 17
Fig. 4S(a) exhibits the pump-probe kinetics obtained upon 400 nm excitation of a
polycrystalline ZnSe sample. The pump beam was < 1 µJ to prevent the damage to the
sample, so ∆OD at 800 nm was low, ca. 2.5x10-2. A biexponential fit with time constants
of 13.7 and 913 ps was used to fit these kinetics. The slower component becomes faster at
the  higher  pump  radiances  which  suggests  that  this  component  is  due  to  the
recombination dynamics, whereas the faster component is from the carrier trapping.  27
Fig. 4S(b) exhibits FDSS kinetics from the same sample that were obtained for τp=20 fs,
τL=100 fs, GVD of -0.82 ps2 (s=-2,048) and τGVD=905 fs (75K pulses were averaged to
achieve a standard deviation of 3x10-4 on the base line). In Fig. 9(a), these FDSS kinetics
were normalized by the T=+30 ps "kinetics" obtained to determine the spectral response
of the sample to the probe light (that was not quite flat, see Fig. 4S(b)). Most of the signal
is comprised of the "spike" near the origin that exhibits several well-resolved beats; the
plateau is 4 times weaker than the central beat. In Fig. 9(a) this plateau is compared in
shape with the kinetic profile obtained in the pump-probe experiment. These two kinetics
>> τ  is 5
are identical within the experimental error. Note that the FDSS signal for  Te
times  lower  than  the  PPS  signal,  indicating  that  the  pump-probe  measurement  was
actually that of nonlinear refraction (in agreement with the results of refs. 27, 28, and 29).
The  same  is  suggested  by  the  fact  that  the  spacing  between  the  largest  (zero-order)
oscillation in Fig. 9(b) given in the units of τGVD, is 2.7 which is closer to 2.51 given by
eq. (26) than to 4.34 given by eq. (25). Fig. 9(b) shows the least squares fit of the kinetics
using eq. (12) (modified to include the two exponential components) in which the phase
φε, the weights of the two components, and the time constant of the faster component
were floating parameters. This fit gave a time constant of 11±1 ps for the fast component

(which  is  reasonably  close  to  13.7  ps  obtained  from  the  pump-probe  experiment)  and
φε=171±0.5o. From this phase, we estimate  τ
  fs, which is in the correct range for
low-density electron plasma in a polycrystalline semiconductor. 31,32

This  example  illustrates  two  points.  First,  using  FDSS  method  one  can,  at  a
glance, determine whether the signal is dominated by TA or nonlinear refraction. Second,
from  the  oscillation  pattern,  one  can  estimate  the  phase  of  the  dielectric  function.
Simultaneously,  TA  kinetics  can  be  determined  from  the  "tail"  of  the  FDSS  kinetics.
Although the S/N ratio for the FDSS kinetics shown in Fig. 9 was inferior to that for the
PPS  trace  in  Fig.  4S(a)  obtained  under  identical  excitation  conditions,  the  acquisition
time was 3 times shorter for the former. Also, in this particular pump-probe "absorption"
measurement  the  PPS  signal  was  5  times  (!)  larger  than  the  actual  TA  because  it  was
mainly from the photoinduced change in the refraction index.

2. Biphotonic charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) in aqueous sodium iodide.
Electron  photodetachment  from  aqueous  halide  anions  is  a  popular  system  for
modeling solvation-driven electron transfer and, as such, it has been extensively studied
in recent years. 33-37  The CTTS band of (I-)aq is centered at 5.5 eV above the ground state,
and the electron can be detached from this anion using one- or two-photon excitation with
225-272 nm 34,35,36 or 310-313 nm 33 photons. The photoreaction results in the formation
of a neutral iodine atom, (I0)aq, that does not absorb in the VIS and NIR and the so-called
"hydrated" electron, e-
aq, that has a broad absorption band across the 300-1300 nm range
which is centered at 720 nm (at 25oC). 34   This band corresponds to the bound-to-bound
(1s→2p) transition of the electron localized in a nearly spherical potential well. Since the
absorption band of the hydrated electron is much broader than the spectral width of the
800 nm probe pulse, this spectrum is "flat" over the sampling range and shows little time
evolution after the first 5 ps (see below).

According  to  the  model  of  Kloepfer  et  al.  35 (which  is,  in  turn,  based  on  the
molecular  dynamics  simulations  of  Staib  and  Borgis  and  Rossky  and  co-workers,  see
refs. 36 and 37), the electron generated by CTTS is preferentially injected into a shallow
(77  meV)  trap  that  resides  0.5  nm  away  from  the  parent  anion,  forming  a  metastable
-) pair; 35  the charge separation is over in <  200 fs. This pair is stabilized by weak
(I0:eaq
attraction between the electron and the readily polarizable iodine atom. Between 0.2 and
2 ps, the solvent relaxes around the electron causing a continuous blue shift of the TA
band. 34,36 At later delay times, the electron either recombines with the iodine atom with a
time constant of ca. 33 ps (at 295 K), or escapes into the bulk with a time constant of ca.
70 ps. 35

Figs.  5S  and  6S  show  pump-probe  TA  kinetics  for  e-

aq  probed  at  800  nm
following  400  nm  excitation  of  75  mM  iodide  in  water.  Trace  (i)  in  Fig.  6S(a)  was
obtained with a transform limited 800 nm probe pulse; trace (ii) was obtained using the
same  pulse  compressed  to  40  ps.  For  pump  radiance  <  0.3  TW/cm2,  this  excitation  is
biphotonic (Fig. 5S)  37 (our estimate for the absorption coefficient is 9.65±0.1 cm/TW)
and yields sub-ns kinetics (shown in Fig. 6S(a)) that are similar to the kinetics reported
by Kloepfer et al.  35 for bi- 255 nm photon excitation, suggesting similar photophysics.
These kinetics can be (formally) fit using a biexponential dependence with time constants
of 18.3 and 362 ps. For pump irradiance > 0.3 TW/cm2, the kinetics become considerably

20

flatter as the pump power increases (Fig. 5S(b), traces (i) and (ii)) and the photoinduced
signal from e-
aq increases linearly with the irradiance (this dependence is shown in Fig.
5S(a)). The same behavior, in the same power range, was observed for neat water (see the
next  section  and  Fig.  10S(a));  we  attribute  this  switch-over  to  400  nm  excitation  of
photogenerated  pre-thermalized  electrons  into  the  conduction  band  of  water  occurring
within  the  duration  of  the  excitation  pulse.  This  photoexcitation  increases  the  initial
separation between the thermalized electron and the iodine atom and slows down their
geminate recombination which can be observed on the sub-ps time scale. Since optical
cells are rapidly destroyed by the terawatt radiation, at these high pump irradiances the
TA experiment have to be carried out in a high-speed jet whose wobbling surface adds to
the signal instability.

The  PPS  traces  shown  in  Fig.  6S(a)  were  obtained  over  30  min  period  for  a
sample  flowing  in  a  glass  cell  (2-photon  excitation).  Still,  due  to  the  variations  in  the
pump intensity, the S/N ratio was 20:1. Furthermore, nearly 2/3 of the scan time was used
to translate the delay stage. The "noise" is even worse in the "2+1" regime (Fig. 5S(b)), in
which the amplitude is more sensitive to the variation of the 400 nm pump intensity.

For FDSS, the chirp was optimized for the fast component, so that GVD was ca. -
0.8 ps2.  Fig. 6S(b) shows FDSS kinetics obtained for several delay times T of the pump
(30K shots per trace). The peak ∆OD signals (ca. 0.14) obtained using the PPS and FDSS
are  almost  the  same,  suggesting  that  most  of  the  signal  is  due  to  photoinduced
absorbance of the solvated electron. These kinetics were normalized by the T=240  ps
trace (for which the transmission spectrum is least affected by the slow decay), and the
kinetics shifted in time accordingly to obtain a spliced trace shown in Fig. 7S(a) (the PPS
kinetics are juxtaposed on these FDSS kinetics). It is seen that the FDSS and PPS traces
coincide  within  the  95%  confidence  level  of  the  PPS  trace,  while  the  S/N  ratio  of  the
FDSS kinetics is much better, despite the fact that it took us as much time to obtain all six
of these kinetics as to obtain the single pump-probe kinetics. Actually, the "noise" is a
lesser problem than nonflat spectral response, part of which is due to the slow component
in  the  relaxation  dynamics  of  hydrated  electron  that  was  not  observed  by  PPS,  due  to
insufficient spectral resolution. Fig. 8S shows normalized FDSS kinetics (obtained for the
maximum GVD of -1.58 ps2) at different irradiances; each of these kinetics was obtained
over a 5 min sampling period. The improvement in the S/N ratio, as compared to the PPS
kinetics  shown  in  Fig.  5S(b),  is  remarkable,  given  that  both  sets  of  the  kinetics  were
obtained  in  a  thin  150 µm jet, just below the dielectric breakdown. The change in the
kinetic  shape  with  the  pump  power  reflects  a  switchover  between  the  2-  and  "2+1"
photon excitation (see Fig. 5S(a)).

In the FDSS kinetics shown in Fig. 6S(b) and 7S(b) there is a "spike" on the rising
edge  of  the  ∆OD  signal,  where  Te<T  (indicated  with  arrows),  that  does  not  have  a
symmetric  counterpart  for  Te>T.  Fig.  10  (to  be  compared  with  the  theoretical  curves
shown in Fig. 3) demonstrates the evolution of the oscillation pattern as a function of a
stretch  factor;  in  Fig.  9S  the  same  patterns  are  replotted  vs.  the  reduced  time,
τ , to facilitate the comparison. It is apparent from Figs. 10 and 9S that the
−
Te
T
(
oscillation  pattern  is  asymmetric  about  the  time  origin;  this  asymmetry  progressively
decreases as  τ
GVD increases from 0.15 to 1.2 ps (Fig. 9S), due to the relative decrease in
the "spike" amplitude. For the lowest stretch factor of -60, the "spike" is nearly as large
as the signal itself.

A "spike" with a symmetric counterpart near the top of the signal could have been
explained  by  positive  nonlinear  refraction  in  the  sample  (see  Fig.  5).  This,  however,
cannot be the case since at longer delay times, FDSS signal almost equals the absorbance
(as  determined  by  the  PPS).  On  the  other  hand,  the  "spike"  oscillation  takes  1-3  ps,
depending on the GVD, and nonlinear refraction that contributes to the oscillation pattern
cannot be explained by impulsive Raman scattering that occurs within the duration of a
200 fs FWHM pump pulse. The most likely origin of this feature is the spectral evolution
that  occurs  on  time  scales  less  or  comparable  to  τ
GVD.  This  rapid  evolution  has  been
observed  in  the  PPS  experiments  33-37  and  modelled  36 as a continuous red shift of the
electron band as the species thermalizes. The theory developed in section II does not deal
with such a situation; nevertheless, some inference can be made as to the effect of such
an  evolution.  In  particular,  if  the  thermalization  process  takes  less  than  τ
GVD,  the
distortion of the oscillation pattern will be limited to at most one oscillation with a period
of  ≈ τ
GVD , and this oscillation will precede the pattern from the thermalized species in the
group delay. This is precisely what is observed in Figs. 10 and 9S. For a Lorentzian line

during  the  solvation  process,  36  the  phase  φε swings from –(50-70)o  to  +68o  (at  which

sin
oscillation  pattern.  As  shown  in  the  next  section,  a  similar  feature  is  observed  for
hydrated electron generated by photoionization of neat water.

To conclude, the iodide system illustrates the superiority of FDSS over PPS for a
photosystem  where  the  “noise”  is  mainly  due  to  poor  stability  in  the  yield  of
photogenerated species. Not only were we able to correctly reproduce the kinetics in the
selected time window; it was possible to splice several such kinetics to cover a longer
delay  range.  Evidence  for  the  predominance  of  absorption  in  the  ∆T Tω ω/
  signal  was
obtained  and  short-term  spectral  evolution  recognized  through  the  asymmetry  of  the
oscillation pattern.

3. Photoionization of neat water.

The conduction band of liquid water is positioned 8-9 eV above the ground state
and simultaneous absorption of three 400 nm photons is sufficient to ionize this liquid. 38
A 3-photon absorption coefficient of 900 cm3/TW2 has been reported for H2O; 39 recently,
we revised this estimate to 270 cm3/TW2 and obtained a quantum yield of 0.41 e-
aq per 3
photons  (unpublished).  When  the  radiance  exceeds  0.6-1.2  TW/cm2,  another  400  nm
photon  is  absorbed  by  a  pre-thermalized  electron  and  the  resulting  “hot”  electron  is
injected  deep  into  the  conduction  band  (Fig.  10S).  In  less  than  50  fs,  this  electron
localizes several nanometers away from the parent hole. As a result, the "3+1" process
makes the geminate recombination less efficient. The escape yield of hydrated electron at
500 ns increases from 70% to 92% (see, for example, Fig. 10S(b)) as the average width
of the electron-hole distribution increases from 1.15 nm (for the 3-photon process) to 2.7
nm (for the "3+1" process). 38

We chose this photosystem because it provides the worst scenario both for pump-

22

probe and spatial-coding “single-shot” spectroscopies: The high, mixed photon order of
the ionization causes strong shot-to-shot variation in the electron yield; this yield also
strongly  varies  across  the  excitation  beam.  For  the  average  pump  radiance  of  0.1-0.4
TW/cm2, a switchover of the dynamic behavior from 3 photon to "3+1" process occurs at
the  higher  end  of  the  variation  range.  Since  water  and  most  other  dielectric  materials
break down at 1-5 TW/cm2, the photolysis is carried out in a high-speed jet, and the light
scatter and thermal lensing in the jet further add to the noise. The absorption of the 400
nm light in water is extremely non-uniform; in particular, at 0.5-1 TW/cm2, 80-90% of
the light is absorbed in a 10-20 µm thin layer near the surface. Although ∆OD of 0.01-1
can be obtained for radiances just below the dielectric breakdown (10 TW/cm2), the shot-
to-shot variance of the TA is comparable to the TA signal itself.

Pump-probe  kinetics  of  hydrated  electron  in  neat  H2O  were  obtained  in  the  3-
photon regime using 0.15 TW/cm2, 400 nm pump pulses of 200 fs FWHM. The pump
radiance  was  estimated  from  the  maximum  ∆O D   and  the  known  photophysics
parameters.  Fig.  11S(a)  shows  FDSS  kinetics  normalized  by  the  spectral  response
determined at later delay times (in the same way as for the iodide system). For s=-2,130,
the  maximum  time  window  is  ca.  60  ps,  and  the  decay  kinetics  were  quite  flat.  The
oscillation pattern near the kinetic origin exhibits an asymmetric pattern that is similar to
- in the iodide system; perhaps, it also originates in the solvation
the  one  found  for  eaq
dynamics of the electron on the fast time scale. Fig. 11S(b) shows 140 ps long stretches
of the FDSS kinetics obtained at GVD of -1.46 ps2 for three pump powers in the "3+1"
region.  As  ∆OD  increases  from  0.017  to  0.2  to  0.4;  the  amplitude  of  the  oscillation
pattern  decreases  in  the  opposite  order.  Similar  trends  were  observed  for  other
photosystems (e.g., see Fig. 8S): the interference effects that give rise to the oscillation
pattern were much weaker in these strongly absorbing samples.

Note that same "noise" level was observed in the FDSS kinetics before and after
the pump pulse, suggesting that most of the "noise" was due to the flow instabilities in
the  jet,  despite  the  high  photon  order.  Though  the  S/N  ratio  for  the  FDSS  kinetics
obtained  using  the  jet  was  significantly  worse  than  the  same  ratio  obtained  for  solid
samples and liquid solutions flowed in a cell, the averaging was still considerably more
efficient than in the PPS experiment. We believe that most of the scatter is caused by a
wobbling jet surface: Near the nozzle, where the flow is most stable, the jet is a concave
lens that strongly refracts and disperses probe light.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS.

In section V and Appendix 2, several photosystems were studied using FDSS in
which the probe light was chirped using a grating compressor. In all four of the examined
photosystems,  FDSS  yielded  a  superior  S/N  ratio  than  PPS  over  a  shorter  acquisition
time. The sampling time was reduced due to the “single-shot” nature of the method and
elimination of (a relatively slow) mechanical movement of the translation stage. Signals
as low as 10-3 can be studied using this "single-shot" technique.

FDSS  showed  another  advantage,  as  it  allowed  us  to  recognize  whether  the
photoinduced  change  in  the  transmission  of  the  sample  was  due  to  TA  or  nonlinear
refraction.  For  free  carrier  signal  in  ZnSe,  the  phase  of  ∆εω of  the  complex  dielectric
function  was  determined  with  an  accuracy  of  a  few  degrees,  directly  yielding  the

23

scattering time of free electron plasma in this material (section V.1). In Appendix 2, we
illustrated the use of FDSS for a thin sample that exhibited well resolved interference
fringes whose spacing was similar to the spectral width of the probe pulse – an especially
vexing case for PPS. In sections V.3 and V.4, TA kinetics for 2-to-4 photon ionization of
a liquid sample (in a flow cell and in a high-speed jet) were obtained. The S/N ratio for
these  kinetics  greatly  exceeded  this  ratio  for  PPS  kinetics  collected  over  5-10  times
longer acquisition time. As shown in section III.1, the time window (< 160 ps for our
setup)  of  FDSS  can  be  extended  to  300-500  ps,  with  500-1000  channels  across  the
sampling  interval.  These  FDSS  kinetics  can  be  spliced  together  to  obtain  even  longer
time profiles (section V.3). On the other hand, kinetics shorter than a few picoseconds
exhibit strong oscillations (Fig. 10) and may be of limited use without analysis.

We  conclude  that  FDSS  technique  is  widely  applicable,  versatile,  and  easy  to
implement experimentally. The frequency domain spectrometer can be built side-by-side
with a pump-probe spectrometer in a single setup (section IV). The requirements for the
compressor  are  not  stringent  and  can  be  met  with  the  standard  equipment  used  for
chirped-pulse  amplification.  Long-arm  double  pass  compressors  with  inexpensive
gratings in higher diffraction order can be used to cover a wide spectral range without
much  loss  in  the  GVD  (section  III.1).  The  requirements  on  the  detector  system  are
minimal and can be met without recourse to high-resolution spectrographs (section III.3).
Finally, the method does not require tight control over the profile of the probe and pump
beam (and a priori profiling of the latter), as is the case with "single-shot" methods based
on spatial encoding. 2-6  In particular, the detection can be performed far from the sample,
which makes it ideal for use in confined spaces. As for the spectral profile of the probe
pulse, it should be reasonably close to a Gaussian; however, a "ripple" pattern with peak-
to-peak amplitude of 10-20% can still be tolerated (section III.2). For applications where
amplitude variations of the kinetics are large and repetition rates are low, FDSS has clear
advantage  over  PPS  and  most  other  "single-shot"  spectroscopies.  Though  we  have
discussed transient absorption only, the implementation of FDSS for transient reflectance
is straightforward.

These many advantages come with a grain of salt: FDSS kinetics are not easy to
interpret when the photoinduced spectrum is changing with time. PPS yields kinetics that
are  averaged  over  the  entire  band  pass  of  the  probe  pulse;  even  if  there  is  a  spectral
evolution  within  this  bandpass,  the  acquired  dynamics  can  still  be  used  to  make  an
inference about the system. By contrast, to recover ∆εω(t) from FDSS kinetics one needs
to know exactly how the optical spectrum evolves in the given bandpass. This confines
the  technique  to  photosystems  that  exhibit  relatively  broad  TA  spectra  (that  are
featureless over 200-500 cm-1). Narrow band signals (20-100 cm-1) can still be studied
using FDSS provided that the probe pulse is relatively long (in the picosecond range).
With that deficiency in mind, we are confident that FDSS will find many potential uses
for ultrafast research.

(a) Traces (i) to (v) are FDSS kinetics obtained for a 1 mm thick polycrystalline sample
of ZnSe excited with 400 nm photons and probed with a compressed τp=20 fs, 800 nm
probe pulse (s=-2,048, τGVD=905 fs). See also Figs. 4S(a) and 4S(b). These FDSS traces
were obtained for several delay times T (0, -10, -20, -30, and -50 ps, respectively) of the
τL=100 fs pump pulse and normalized by the T=+30 ps trace (not shown) that yielded the
spectral response of the sample (Fig. 4S(b)). Filled circles correspond to the PPS kinetics
shown in Fig. 4S(a) that were scaled down by a factor of 5 to match the FDSS kinetics,
trace (i), in amplitude. In the plateau region of the FDSS traces, ∆OD signal is ca. 3x10-3.
The large scaling factor and poor S/N ratio in the FDSS traces originate through the fact
that  most  of  the  "transient  absorbance"  signal  obtained  using  PPS  was  due  to  the
photoinduced negative change in the refraction index.  (b) A simlation of the oscillation

the  pump  pulse  was  chosen  to  take  the  maximum  advantage  of  the  800  nm  probe
bandpass  and  differed  between  the  traces.  The  800  nm  absorbance  is  from  hydrated
-, that fully thermalizes in 2 ps. The stretch factor s and τGVD (for a τp=20 fs
electron, eaq
probe pulse) are, respectively (a) -59 and 153 fs, (b) -370 and 384 fs, (c) -1,430 and 756
fs,  and  (d)  -3,720  and  1.22  ps.  Each  trace  is  the  average  of  90K  pump  on  -  pump  off

arrows indicate the position of the "spike" that lacks a symmetric counterpart for Te>T

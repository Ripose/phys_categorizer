Introduction 

The origins of European agriculture are normally sought in the Near East. The earliest 

indicators of agriculture in the form of cultivation of cereals and pulses are rearing of animals 

come from Zagros foothills. Their age, 11700 – 8400 BC corresponds to the cool dry climatic 

period followed by a rapid increase in rainfall at the beginning of the Holocene (~ 10000 BC). 

During the early stages of agricultural development (Preceramic Neolithic 9800 – 7500 

BC)  the  rapid  increase  in  the  number  of  sites  is  noticeable  in  both  the  foothills  and  the 

surrounding  plains  accompanied  by  the  appearance  of  large  settlements  with  complicated 

masonry structures and fortifications (e.g. Jericho). 

At a later stage the core area of early agricultural settlements shifts to the north to the 

eastern  highlands  and  inner  depressions  of  Asia  Minor.  The  most  outstanding  case  of  early 

agricultural  development  in  this  area  is  Catal  Hüyük,  a  Neolithic  town  on  the  Konya  Plain 

(6500 – 5700 BC). 

The earliest sites with developed agricultural economies in Europe, dated 6400 – 6000 

BC are found in the intermontane depressions of Greece (Thessaly, Beotia and Pelloponesse). 

Genetic  features  of  the  cultigens  and  the  general  character  of  the  material  culture  leave  no 

doubt to their Near – Eastern origins. Significantly, the early Neolithic sites in the Marmara 

Sea  are  of  a  more  recent  age  (6100  –  5600  BC),  being  culturally  distinct  from  the  Early 

Neolithic in Greece. This implies that the Neolithic communities could penetrate the Balkan 

Peninsula from Western Asia by means of navigation. 

The  Neolithic  spread  further,  plausibly  via  the  Strouma  axis  in  the  northeast  and  the 

Vardar – Morava axis in the north. The ensuing development saw a rapid growth of Neolithic 

settlements  in  the  depressions  of  northern  Thrace  the  Lower  and  Middle  Danube  catchment 

basin (5900 – 5500 BC). 

Tisza Plain in 5600 – 5500 BC [1]. 

The  next  stage  in  the  Neolithic  development  saw  the  emergence  of  new  sites  on  the 

The  new  sites  later  spread  over  the  vast  areas  of  the  loess  plains  of  Central  Europe, 

mostly along the Danube, Rhine – Mainz and Vistula axes. This spread occurred within the 

range of 5600 – 4800 BC within the most probable age of 5154 ± 62 BC [2]. 

Judging from the number of sites the population in the Near East started increasing  ~ 

15000 BC. Ammerman and Cavalli – Sforza [3] focused on measuring the rate of spread of 

early farming in Europe and derived the rate of spread v ~ 1 km/year on average in Europe. 

The Danube and Rhine valleys the propagation paths had an increased propagation speed as 

did the Mediterranean west [4]. The speeds of propagation of the wave front v in these areas 

are as follows: 

v = 1 km/year on average in Europe 

v = 4 – 6 km/year for the Danube – Rhine valleys 

v = 10 km/year for Mediterranean regions 

Interpretations  of  these  observations  are  usually  based  on  the  reaction  –  diffusion 

equation of population dynamics [5,6]. Fort and Méndez [6,7] discussed the front propagation 

rate  resulting  from  the  generalization  of  Fisher  model,  but  their  results  are  restricted  to  the 

homogenous system. 

The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  formulate  and  develop  a  model  for  the  spread  of  incipient 

farming  in  Europe  taking  into  account  the  environmental  influences  on  the  migration

Fick  diffusion  equation  is  a  special  case  of  the  parabolic  transport  equation  in  which 

speed of perturbation propagation is infinite. Parabolic transport equation has been applied to 

the spread of advantageous genes [8] dispersion of biological population [9], epidemic models 

However  if  perturbation  propagates  at  finite  speed,  Fick  law  does  not  hold  [11].  This 

unphysical feature can be avoided by making use of hyperbolic transport equation [11]. The 

hyperbolic  propagation  equation,  HPE  has  been  very  recently  applied  to  the  spread  of 

epidemics [12], forest fire models [13] and chemical system [14]. 

An  interesting  application  of  the  Fick  law  to  the  migration  in  neolithic  Europe  was 

Such a model as was presented in [15] provides a consistent explanation for the origin of 

Indo  –  European  languages  [16]  and  also  finds  remarkable  support  from  the  observed  gene 

In this paper we develop the model for the population migration following the method 

Let  n(x,t)  stands  for  population  density  (measured  in  number  of  families  per  square 

kilometer) where x is Cartesian coordinate and t is time. We assume that a well defined time

environment.  This  interaction  we  will  model  by  potential  V.  in  that  case  the  hyperbolic 

migration equation can be written as [11]:

In equation (1) D is the migration diffusion coefficient, pk and Ek denote the momentum      

and kinetic energy of migration and G(x,t) is the population growth. 

  Equation (1) is the Heaviside equation for population density [4]. It is the hyperbolic 

equation  which  describes  the  migration  with  memory.  Memory  term

For  V  <  0,  i.e.  for  attractive  potential  equation  (3)  is  the  modified  Klein  –  Gordon

where the u(x,t) is described by formula  (10). 

  As  can  be  seen  from  formula  (11)  the  general  solution  of  Eq.  (1)  is  the  sum  of  the 

wave motion described by the term

and the lag term. 

  In  conclusion  one  can  say  that  the  migration  can  be  described  as  the  damped  wave 

motion which for 

∞→t

 is going to diffusion of the population.

Abstract: 
 
In  many  ways,  the  American  learning  system  is  unique  in  its  reliance  on  testing  using  multiple-choice 
questions. Learning in physics, as well as in any other subject, is a context-dependent process. In this paper, 
I  consider  a  broader  problem  of  where  differences  in  understanding  arise;  often  styles  of  answering 
questions arise from the way the questions are posed. I speculate on the long-run effects a multiple-choice 
based learning system might have on the reasoning structure of the student compared to one based on more 
open-ended  questions.  I  present  some  differences  in  answer  styles  observed  between  two  populations  of 
students,  US  students  (mostly  exposed  to  multiple-choice  type  exams),  and  Romanian  students  (mostly 
exposed  to  open-end  type  exams).  Finally,  I  suggest  some  possible  ways  of  checking  whether  my 
predictions have any validity.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Many  papers  have  been  written  about the  use  of  the  multiple-choice  (MC)  questions  in 
PER  and  in  education  research  in  other  areas.  In  most  of  them,  the  researchers  were 
working  to  develop  effective  multiple-choice  tests  intended  to  be  able  to  evaluate  and 
compare  instructions  that  are  delivered  to  large  populations.  Among  others,  reliability, 
difficulty and discrimination indices have been defined for the multiple-choice questions, 
in order to measure their effectiveness as a measurement instrument (1,2).  
 
Some  researchers  went  further  in  investigating  the  effectiveness  of  the  multiple-choice 
questions.  They  went  beyond  a  traditional  analysis,  which  often  relied  solely  on  scores 
(number of students giving the correct answer) and ignored what could be significant and 
important  information:  the  distribution  of  wrong  answers  given  by  the  class.  Several 
methods  of  measuring  how  students(cid:146)  responses  on  multiple-choice  questions  are 
distributed  have  been  studied.  Concentration  analysis(3)  is  an  effective  mathematical 
tool(cid:151)also  used  in  finance,  under  a  little  different  format(cid:151)for  studying  whether  the 
students  have  common  incorrect  models,  or  if  the  questions  are  effectively  designed  to 
detect students(cid:146) models. Through the use of this analysis, the presence of na(cid:239)ve models in 
a particular population  may  be detected (through design of appropriate distracters in the 
multiple-choice  questions).  When  we  study  student(cid:146)s  different  incorrect  models,  the 
questions  should  be  carefully  designed  so  that  the  distracters  match  the  common 
suspected incorrect models. 

 

Different  contextual  features  can  affect  students(cid:146)  conceptual  learning  in  different  ways. 
With  a  particular  physics  concept, through  systematic  research,  we  can  identify  a  finite 
set of commonly recognized models. Bao et al. (4) have developed mathematical tools for 
investigating  student  models,  which  show  different  structures  with  different  physical 
features. They found that student(cid:146)s reasoning about a physical concept can be in a (cid:147)pure(cid:148) 
single model state when they are consistent in using their models, or in a (cid:147)mixed(cid:148) single 
student  model  state,  when  individual  students  are  inconsistent  in  using  their  models. 
Therefore,  instruction  should  be  developed  based  on  a  good  understanding  of  the 
possibilities  of  student  models,  as  well  as  the  effect  of  contextual  features  (2).  But,  the 
(cid:147)possibilities  of  student  models(cid:148)  are  based  on  previous  contextual  features  that  we  are 
going to define later at a larger scale. 
 
The  question  of  which  sort of test  (objective,  essay,  etc.) to  use  during  exams  has  been 
discussed  by  many  authors  (see,  for  example,  Refs.  5-8).  There  have  been  both, 
emotional  and  substantive  appeals  for  the  use  of  objective  tests,  and  equally  forceful 
statements opposed to objective tests.  We believe that, if wisely combined and designed, 
both  types  of  tests  can  be  very  useful.  But  few  of  the  researches  that  have  discussed 
multiple-choice  questions  consider  the  long-run  consequences  of  the  excessive  reliance 
on multiple-choice exam questions. 
    
There  is  a  paradox  here:  Even  though  they  are  meant  merely  as  a  measurement 
instrument,  for  evaluating  learning  in  a  class,  the  multiple-choice  (MC)  questions  may 
actually irreversibly shape the whole structure of students(cid:146) reasoning in Physics, as well 
as in other fields. It is as in quantum mechanics: the measurement instrument is changing 
the  state  of  the  system.  In  this  paper  I  take  a  broader  view  of  (cid:147)context-dependent 
student(cid:146)s  learning  (and  reasoning)  process,(cid:148)  and  suggest  some  implications  beyond  the 
limited area of the physics learning process.  

 

To  some  extent,  the  present  paper  itself  is  a  result  of  a  cross-cultural  experience,  as 
suggested symbolically in the figure bellow.

Cross-cultural  social  interactions  are  very  enriching  experiences.  Sometimes,  what  it  is 
very easy to understand and obvious within your cultural structure, it is very difficult to 
understand for one who has grown up within the other culture. This paper speculates on 
some possible consequences of an over-extensive reliance on multiple-choice questions. 
 
 

  

II.  CONTEXT-DEPENDENT  STUDENT  LEARNING  AND  REASONING 
STRUCTURES 
I shall try further to better analyze the phenomenon of context-dependent student learning. 
Related to this we need some definitions. I define the environment (E) as being the whole 
context in which a student lives. The environment (E) is composed out of School-Context 
(SC)  and  Outside  School-Context  (OSC).  The  OSC  is  defined  by  all  the  factors  (cid:151)  the 
micro-contexts (mc) (cid:151) that, throughout one(cid:146)s lifetime influence his way of reasoning or 
of  looking at the world (the social  factor, the cultural  factor, the free-time  factor and so 
on). We shall denote the factors (micro-contexts), composing the OSC, as F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , etc. 
The  SC  is  defined  by  the  whole  learning  system,  (cid:151)  everything  with  which  a  student 
interacts throughout his or her studies (cid:151) such as the number of classes per quarter, the 
number of hours per week, the way the examinations are held(cid:151)MC questions vs. open-
ended  (OE)  questions  vs.  a  mixture--,  the  method  of  instruction,  etc.  We  shall  denote 
these  factors  (micro-contexts)  as  f 1 ,  f 2 ,  f 3 ,  etc.  We  also  define  a  MC-type  learning 
system as being a learning system where students(cid:146) examinations are extensively based on 
MC  questions.  The  same,  we  define  an  OE-type  learning  system  as  being  a  learning 
system where students(cid:146) examinations are extensively based on OE-type questions.   
 
Much  research  has  shown  that  different  instructional  methods  (cid:151)  such  as  tutorial  or 
traditional (cid:151) give different results between the pre- and post-instruction in the short-term 
(one  quarter or  semester).(3)  It  is  therefore  likely  that two  different  learning  systems  (cid:151) 
one based on MC questions, the other on OE questions (cid:151) within two different cultural 
contexts  will,  in  the  long  run,  influence  the  reasoning  system  of  the  two  student 
populations  very  differently. Every  mc  influences  the  reasoning  structure  (R)  of  the 
student. If you change one parameter (in the mc), then even though its effect in the short-
run might be barely observable, in the long run it might have enormous effects. 
 
                                                    R = g({fi},{Fj})                                                             2.1 
 
In this paper we shall focus mainly on the influence of one particular SC micro-context f 1  
(cid:151) MC vs. OE question exams -- on student(cid:146)s reasoning structure. We also discuss briefly 
the  influence  of  one  OSC  micro-context  F 1  (cid:151)  the  free-time  factor--on  the  student(cid:146)s 
reasoning  structure.  Let  R 1  and  R 2  be  the  reasoning  structures  of  two  representative 
students  from  two  different  learning  systems:  one  from  a  MC-type  learning  system  (a 
typical  US  student),  the  other  one  from  an  OE-type  learning  system  (an  international 
student). Then, relation 2.1 becomes: 
 
                                           R 1 =g(f 1 , F 1 , all other factors)                                               2.2 
                                           R 2 =g(f ’
 
where,  f 1  is  a  MC  question  exam  micro-context,  and  f ’
1  is  an  OE  question  exam  micro-
context. F 1  and F ’
1  are the free-time factors (micro-contexts) in the two learning systems 
considered.  Assuming  that  overall,  the  (cid:147)other  factors(cid:148)  are  similar  in  both  learning 
environments,  which  is  a  not-too-unreal  assumption  if  we  pick  two  countries  with 

1 , all other factors), 

1 , F ’

reasonably similar cultures, we can try to analyze qualitatively the way the micro-context 
f 1  influences the student’s reasoning structure over the long run. 
 
One  feature  of  the  American  learning  system  seen  in  primary  school  through  the 
university level (and, for many fields of study, even at the graduate level) is an emphasis 
on  MC  questions.  Among  the  other  global  learning  systems,  Americans  seem  uniquely 
reliant on MC questions. Most other learning systems do use the MC questions to some 
extent (cid:151) in many cases imitating the American system (cid:151) but few use them to the same 
extent as they are used in the US.  
 
In  our  opinion  (one  should  gather  experimental  data  to  test  this  opinion),  use  of  MC 
questions is directly correlated with students(cid:146) reasoning in working physics problems (as 
well as problems from other fields) after they have been acculturated to them.  
 
III.  SOME  ADVANTAGES  AND  DISADVANTAGES  OF  USE  OF  MC  vs.  OE 
QUESTIONS 
There  are  several  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  using  the  multiple-choice  system 
rather than an open-ended system. The student study strategy differs between MC and OE 
tests, and the test-maker must consider course and instructor goals for students carefully 
before  choosing  to  use  either  MC  or  OE  questions  on  an  exam.  For  example,  for  a 
Physics  by  Inquiry  course,  which  emphasizes  reasoning,  it  would  be  contrary  to  the 
course goals (and spirit) to use MC questions to any extent. I shall enumerate briefly the 
most important advantages and disadvantages of MC vs. OE questions. 
 
Advantages: 
i) It simplifies a student(cid:146)s learning process considerably (at least that part of it needed to 
be efficient at exams). The student is focused on the important things from the material. 
As  it  was  noted  before,(1,2)  it  takes  a  great  deal  of  effort  to  make  good  MC  questions. 
Many teachers fail to make the effort, because it requires considerable time to do the job 
right.  As  a  result,  most  of  the  time  the  teacher(cid:146)s  expected  ((cid:147)right(cid:148))  answer  is  totally 
different  from  the  distractors.  This  simplifies  the  student(cid:146)s  task  of  identifying  the  right 
answer. Recognizing the right answer among wrong answers is much easier than creating 
the right answer from one(cid:146)s knowledge base. (This, of course, does not apply to the MC 
questions  developed  by  organizations  such  as  the  College  Board  and  the  American 
College Testing Service because of the painstaking nature of their development process.) 
 
ii)  Also,  the  MC  questions  give  the  student  a  finite  (a  (cid:147)discrete(cid:148))  number  of  answers, 
usually four to five. On the other hand, potentially there exist an infinite (a (cid:147)continuous(cid:148)) 
number of answers from which he usually has to choose the correct one. This is a further 
simplification which makes the student feel more comfortable.  
 
iii) This  (cid:147)MC system(cid:148)  focuses student attention on a (cid:147)discrete-tempered(cid:148) reasoning and 
by extension  may  lead students to look at the world as  made up of such discrete bits of 
knowledge,  belief,  and  so  on.  This  discrete-tempered(cid:150)type  of  reasoning  makes  the 
student  more  efficiently  integrated  in  the  real  world  where  this  kind  of  clear,  discrete-
like-type reasoning structure is much more suitable for being successful in the business-

like environment (where the processes are also discrete-tempered)  in which  he probably 
is going to activate.   

 

 

                                                        a)                               b) 
 Fig.3.1. a) discrete-tempered reasoning; b) business-like environment with discrete-tempered processes 
 
iv) Multiple-choice questions help students feel more confident of their (cid:147)knowledge(cid:148)(cid:151)a 
paradox!(cid:151)eliminating  the  confusion  and  uncertainty  in  choosing  from  among  many 
other potential answers (created or memorized). For a MC question on an exam, there is 
clearly  only  one  correct  answer,  which  must  be  among  those  written  down  by  the 
instructor.  Once  it  is  chosen,  that(cid:146)s  it, the  mental  check-off  is  done,  the  job  completely 
finished. The student can confidently move on to the next question. In the long run, this 
could  contribute  to  the  self-confidence  and  transparency  (and  sometimes  obstinacy  and 
unwillingness to listen) many find characteristic of American culture. 
 
v) And, last but not least, while writing a good objective test (MC, true-false, matching, 
etc.) is more difficult than writing a good essay test, grading is considerably easier. Some 
researchers (1) have referred to this as an example of a conservation law ((cid:147)conservation of 
difficulty(cid:148)) in test-making. In addition, once one has written some good multiple-choice 
questions (as measured by appropriate difficulty and discrimination indices), they may be 
used  multiple  times  (with  several  classes  or  in  different  years),  simplifying  one(cid:146)s 
subsequent test-making.  
 
Disadvantages: 
i)  When  given  good  OE  questions,  students  will  not  be  able  to  write  a  coherent  answer 
without a deep understanding of the material (of course, such knowledge is necessary, but 
not sufficient). In physics, students who have not really learned to think deeply about the 
material reach for formulas(cid:151)learned by heart and often thrown on the paper without any 
evidence  of  clear  reasoning  (and  often  incoherent)(cid:151)as  salvation.  Their  answers  are 
seldom written entirely correctly.  We often give students the opportunity to bring a 3x5 
index card of formulas they choose or supply a formula sheet with the exam. After long 
practice at answering MC questions, students are not easily able to formulate an answer 
in  their  own  words. The  converse  is  not true,  however:  Students  practiced  at  answering 
OE  questions  are  at  least  as  able  to  pick  the  correct  choice  from  the  distracters.  Most 
teachers would agree that the ability to answer in one(cid:146)s own words proves that a correct 
and  deep  understanding  of  the  material  has  been  achieved  (that  is  indeed  the  major 
argument of opponents of MC questions).  
 
ii)  Multiple-choice  questions  present  students  with  a  simplified  space  ((cid:147)discrete-
tempered,(cid:148)  one  with  discrete  modes  of  reasoning,  with  few  alternatives,  very  clearly 

formulated  in  standard  ways)  corresponding  to  each  question  vs.  the  whole  space  (a 
(cid:147)continuous(cid:148)  one  with  continuous  modes  of  reasoning),  potentially  having  an  infinite 
number of answers that the student can formulate to each question. Indeed, the simplified 
space is a projection of the whole. In the whole space, within the same answer, there exist 
multiple ways of formulating the same idea, not a standard, optimized, rigid one. In time, 
this  kind  of  learning  system  shapes  student(cid:146)s  reasoning  system  in  a  (cid:147)discrete(cid:148)  way  as 
discussed in (iii) above. This way of thinking may integrate the student more efficiently 
into the real world, where this sort of clear, discrete-tempered reasoning is quite suitable 
for  achieving  success  in  the  business  world  (where  people  commonly  encounter  such 
discrete-tempered processes and reasoning). The author has an M.B.A., and has observed 
this  discrete-tempering  firsthand.  It  is  comfortable  also  for  those  people  who  see  the 
world  as  rule-bound,  and  is  dangerous  to  the  extent  that  people  view  the  discreteness 
rather than continuity as a characteristic of ideas or (cid:147)pieces of knowledge.(cid:148)  
In the figure bellow we represented symbolically the reasoning structures associated with 
the two different learning-systems. 

 

                      a)                          b) 

 
Fig.  3.2.      a)  discrete-tempered  reasoning  structure,  with  discrete  modes  of  reasoning;  b)  continuous-tempered 
reasoning structure, with continuous modes of reasoning (at least approximately, relative to the first system). d-distance 
(space) between two modes (of reasoning, of feeling. etc) 
 
Taking  the  analogy  further,  just  as  an  electron  bounded  within  an  atom  has  discrete 
energy  levels,  the  same,  a  student  within  a  learning  system  has  discrete  reasoning 
modes(cid:151)generated by the system, of course. The second system,(cid:151)the one based  mostly 
on OE-type exams-- which is somehow less efficient (then the MC system) for the future 
business-like environment, in which the student will enter-- also generates discrete modes, 
because within any system there will exist some discrete reasoning modes (generated by 
the system). But what I am suggesting  is that its (cid:147)quantum(cid:148)  is smaller than that created 
by the MC-type system. Actually, the  more constraints(cid:151)strict rules and standards to be 
obeyed by students(cid:151) will be within a learning system, the bigger will be the (cid:147)quantum,(cid:148) 
and  the  smaller  will  be  the  possibility  of  the  reasoning  structure  to  evolve  unbounded.  
The free-time micro-context (F 1 ) is an example of such a constraint. The smaller the free-
time of a student(cid:151)as a consequence of a high volume of home-works,  classes, or part-
time  jobs that he or she has to do after classes, etc.(cid:151)the stronger will  be the associated 
constraint,  and  the  higher  will  be  the  (cid:147)quantum.(cid:148)  A  way  of  measuring  the  (cid:147)quantum(cid:148) 
would be to test the flexibility of the student to reason around a standard mode. The more 
confused will be the student by slightly changes about the standard he was taught in class 
(to solve or reason about a problem), the bigger the (cid:147)quantum(cid:148) will be.    
 
As  an  example,  during  the  tutor-hours,  when  the  author  was  trying  to  explain  some 
problems to students, whenever he was not solving the problems following the exact form 
they had been taught in class, students generally refused to consider the solution. While 

 

some  of  this  might  be  explained  on  the  basis  of  personality,  the  lack  of  willingness  to 
consider  a  different  (though  equivalent)  formulation  of  the  solution  is  indicative  of  a 
general  rigidity.  The  discrete-tempered  reasoning  in  their  histories,  imposed  by  their 
learning  system,  eliminated  their  flexibility  in  considering  reasoning  not  in  the  exact 
replica of an expected (cid:147)standard mode.(cid:148)  
 
iii)  Along with the MC discrete structure, the expectation of the proposed answer  in the 
most direct and (cid:147)standard(cid:148) possible way (and, in general, of writing the academic English, 
which involves strict rules) emphasizes those discrete modes of reasoning that the student 
will  already  have.  Trying  to  write  a  certain  phrase  or  sentence  always  in  its  optimized 
(straightforward)  way  to  achieve  maximum  impact  on  the  ear  (and  mind)  of  the  reader 
often degenerates into use of bunches of code expressions, already known by the whole 
community,(cid:151)blocks,  or  predetermined  optimized  sequence  of  words(cid:151)instead  of  using 
ordinary words in an arbitrary sequence. This practice (used also by teachers) leads many 
students to fail to recognize a correct answer among distractors when the correct answer 
is not written (cid:147)in the code.(cid:148)  
 
IV. SOME RESULTS OBTAINED ON A SHORT E&M SURVEY  
In this section we shall present briefly the results obtained on a short E&M survey given 
to  two  populations  of  students  belonging  to  two  different  learning  systems:  one 
population of students (typical American students, from The Ohio State University) have 
been mostly exposed throughout their studies to MC question exams (mostly problems), 
while  the  other  one  (typical  Romanian  students,  from  Bucharest  University)  to  OE 
question exams (problems and theory). Another important difference between these two 
populations  of  students  is  that  the  Romanian  students  had  had  Physics  courses  in  High 
School  before  entering  University  (in  Romania,  Physics  and  Mathematics  are  required 
fields of study in most High Schools), while most American students hadn(cid:146)t had any class 
of Physics in High School. Also, the free-time factor F 1  is considerable different for the 
two populations of students. While American students, during the academic year are held 
very busy by the high volume of home-works and classes, (and a lot of them by the part-
time jobs where they have to go after classes) Romanian students have considerable more 
free-time  that  they  can  spend  as  they  desire;  almost  none  of  them  is  working  besides 
school, -- it(cid:146)s basically a free education system in state universities -- and the volume of 
home-works  is  much  smaller.  In  table  4.1  bellow,  one  problem  from  the  short  E&M 
survey  and  two  representative  (cid:147)good  answers,(cid:148)  one  from  a  Romanian  student  and  the 
other one from an American student, are presented. In tables 4.2 to 4.6 are presented their 
overall results.   
 

Table 4.1 
Problem (E&M survey).     You have a charged particle inside a region containing a constant uniform magnetic field.  
a)  What  is  the  magnetic  force  (magnitude  &  direction)  acting  on  the  charged  particle  if  the  initial  velocity  is  zero? 
What is the trajectory of this particle? 
b)  What  is  the  magnetic  force  acting  on  the  charged  particle  if  the  initial  speed  of  the  charge  is  v  (known,  but 
unspecified here) and the direction is parallel to B? What is the trajectory of this particle? 
c)  What  is  the  magnetic  force  acting  on  the  charged  particle  if  the  initial  speed  of  the  charge  is  v  (known,  but 
unspecified here) and the direction is perpendicular to B? What is the trajectory of this particle? 
d)  What  is  the  magnetic  force  acting  on  the  charged  particle  if  the  initial  speed  of  the  charge  is  v  (known,  but 
unspecified here) and the angle between v and B is α? What is the trajectory of this particle? 
 

Romanian student representative (good) answer: 
a) The magnetic force for a charge in an uniform field is: f=qvxB. If v=0, than f=0, and it will not be accelerated in the 
field, hence we can(cid:146)t speak of direction of the force, but we can say that the magnitude is always zero.  
 
b) v║B, v≠0, f=qvxB=qvBsinα; v║B=0→ α=0 →sinα=0; →f=0; Hence the trajectory is a straight line parallel the lines 
of magnetic field. The equation of the motion will be: 

x=x(0)+vt, where v=ct. 

c) if v(cid:31) B, then α=90, sinα =1. The trajectory of the particle will be a circle perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. 
The magnitude of the force is f=qvB, and the direction is that of the radius of the circle pointing towards the center of 
the circle. 

 

 

d)  (cid:139)(v;B)=α, is the superposition of the two previous cases, and the trajectory of the particle will be a helicoidal one, 
with parameters radius and step: 
                             step=v(║) T; radius=f(v(┴); m) 

where  m  is  the  mass  of  the  particle.  The  magnitude  of  the  magnetic  force  is  f=qvBsinα  and  the  direction  is  always 
perpendicular to the trajectory.  
 
American student representative (good) answer: 
a) F(L)=qvxB; if v=0, then F(L)=0;         ┴to magnetic field 
b) F(L)=qvxB=qvBsinӨ =qvxBsin0=0;           across magnetic field

Even though the number of Romanian students (52) that have taken the survey is smaller 
than  the  number  of  American  students  (74),  we  can  draw  some  important observations, 
related to their answering styles, aligned with the qualitative study from this paper.  
 
As  one  can  see,  their  answers  look  very  different.  While  the  Romanian  student  (whose 
answer was presented) is writing more words, trying to be as explicit as he can answering 
each question, the American student is very brief in his answers, writing mostly formulas 
(and this held true for almost all Romanian and American students who gave reasonable 
good answers for the problems as one can see also from Table 4.6). In fact, as one can see 
in  Table  4.1  above,  the  American  student  is  using  basically  the  minimum  number  of 
formulas,  words  or  symbols  necessary  for  answering  (and  justifying  an  answer)  each 
question, while the Romanian student is trying to explain in words each step needed for 
solving  the  problem,  in  the  reasoning  process,.  Note  that  the  American  student,  whose 
answer  was  chosen  for  being  presented  (see  Table  4.1),  consider  even  not  necessary  to 
mention the arguments in the above equations. On the other hand, analyzing the student 
category  from  each  population,  who  didn(cid:146)t  know  how  to  answer  a  question,  American 
students  seemed  to  have  more  courage  (confidence)  in  approaching  the  questions, 
throwing on the paper some words or formulas (even though not necessarily related to the 
questions), while most of Romanian students from this category left the page blank. This 
could  be  directly  correlated  with  the  confidence  generated  by  the  MC-type  learning 
system that was described in part iv from the (cid:147)advantages(cid:148) section of chapter 3.  
 
In  a  second  experiment  three  American  students  and  three  Romanian  students  were 
interviewed  and  videotaped  in  the  same  time.  They  were  asked  to  explain  loudly  the 
solution  to  each  part of  the  problem  from  Table  4.1.  The  results  are  presented  in  Table 
4.7 bellow.

The  results  from  the  videotaped  interviews  do  not  contradict  the  results  obtained  in  the 
written  survey  or  the  predictions  from  the  paper.  As  in  the  written  surveys,  American 
students seem to be overall more confident on their answers than Romanian students did, 
answering  each  question  using  smaller  number  of  words  than  their  omologs  from 
Romania. Also, American students seemed to be more focused ((cid:147)pure activity mode(cid:148) vs. 
(cid:147)mixed activity mode(cid:148)) on the interview than Romanian students did, talking fewer times 
during the interview about something else not related with the interview.      
 
These  results  are  in  part,  probably,  due  to  the  fact  that  Romanian  students  have  been 
exposed  during  their  exams,  besides  the  OE-type  questions,  also  to  theory-type  of 
questions (cid:151) where they were required to prove step by step theorems, laws, etc, both in 
Mathematics and Physics. But they might also be due to the fact that American students 
have  been  mostly  exposed  during  exams  to  MC  questions  (so, they  have  not  been  used 
too often to write an answer on a paper). Overall the MC-type learning system proved to 
be  pretty  efficient  also  this  time.  American  students  did  in  average  slightly  better  than 
Romanian  students did (see Tables 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5), even though a comparison of this 
type has no relevance, the number of Romanian students being smaller than the number 
of American students. Also, comparing their answers, Romanian students seemed to have 
more  variety  in  their  answers  than  American  students  did.  All  these  results  could  be 
directly correlated with the different types of reasoning structures associated with the two 
different learning systems that were defined earlier (and also with the whole environment 
(E) that  defines  the  context  in  which  the  learning  process takes  place  in  each  country  (cid:150) 
see Chapter 2).  
  
V. GENESIS OF THIS IDEA 
This  paper  is  also  the  result  of  a  cross-cultural  experience.  It  is  obvious  that  (cid:147)to  see 
ourselves as others see us(cid:148) involves interaction with those others; one who comes from a 
different  type  of  environment,  learning  system,  and  language  structure  can  easily  see 
many things that are beneath notice to the person steeped in his own culture.  
 
Many times talking with students or people from the street, etc., I (the author is a native 
of  Romania)  put  questions  in  my  best  possible  English  (like  words)  but  not  using  the 
exact (optimized) sequence of words that they were used to hear for similar questions. If 
you were following my words individually, word by word, it would have been very easy 
to  understand  what  I  was  saying.  The  result  was  that  they  seemed  to  not  understand 
anything  from  what  I  was  saying,  even  though  each  individual  word  that  I  was  using 
sounded  to  me  perfectly  correct  like  accent or  pronunciation.  Also,  when  I  was  talking 
the  exact  block  of  words  (optimized  expressions),  even  though  not  using  my  best 

pronunciation,  they  understood  me  perfectly  from  the  first  shot.  In  that  moment,  I 
understood that English is a language that you don(cid:146)t learn it word by word, but you learn 
it  in  expressions,  in  optimized  blocks  of  words.  Most  people  here  are  used  to  hear 
expressions, optimized blocks of words, and not individual words.          
 
There are two factors that contribute to this optimization of the language use. One is the 
English language structure which encourages these kinds of optimizations to some extent 
more  than  other  languages  do.  The other  factor  is  derived  from  the  American  business-
oriented  culture(cid:146)s  simplification  and  optimization  processes  that  are  present  also  at this 
level. It is some kind of (cid:147)reengineering(cid:148) process  at the language  level (cid:151) that of course 
has  implications  on  student(cid:146)s  reasoning  structure  over  the  long-run  (cid:151)  which  aims  to 
achieve  clear  and  efficient  communication  through  this  kind  of  optimized  expressions 
(efficient + direct + best effect to audience).  
 
We  also  assist  at  a  discretization  process  happening  in  student(cid:146)s  mind  even  at  a  larger 
scale. It appears that it(cid:146)s a very clear separation, in students(cid:146) reasoning structure (seeable 
of course also in their actions) among activities. It(cid:146)s like they are  in  (cid:147)a  learning  mode,(cid:148) 
(cid:147)in  a  lab  doing  mode,(cid:148)  in  (cid:147)a  holiday  mode,(cid:148)  in  (cid:147)a  studying  mode,(cid:148)  in  a  (cid:147)Go  Bucks 
mode!,(cid:148) and so on. Observing for a long time students(cid:146) behavior during the lab hours, the 
author was surprised to see that most of the students were focusing in a silent way, on the 
lab (a (cid:147)lab doing mode(cid:148)), not speaking anything else with their colleagues. Similar things 
the  author observed  in  students(cid:146)  behavior  before  the  beginning  of  the  lab  (as  well  as  in 
other  situations):  They  are  silently  waiting  for  the  lab  instructor,  skimming  through the 
lab  manual,  barely  talking  with  each  other.  The  results  obtained  in  the  videotaped 
interviews seem to confirm these predictions.  
 
This kind of clear separation between activities and mental states, that might be specific 
for the American students, it(cid:146)s very different from the behavior of students from Romania 
(as well as from other European countries) where students do not seem at all to be in this 
kind  of  (cid:147)pure  activity  modes.(cid:148)  They  are  much  noisier,  talking  with  each  other  not 
necessarily about the lab, the experiment they are doing, or school in general.  
   
The  above  macro-discretization  phenomenon  is  probably  also  a  consequence  of  some 
subtle  reengineering  processes  happening  at reasoning  and  behavior  levels  (cid:151)  probably, 
naturally  emerged  from  economics  rationales  (cid:151)  aiming  for  better  efficiency  and 
productivity. Of course that being in a (cid:147)pure mode(cid:148) (single-activity mode) you are much 
more  efficient  at  that  activity  than  being  in  a  (cid:147)mixed-activity  (and  mental)  mode.(cid:148) 
Probably the MC-learning system is an important part of these reengineering processes.    
 
Even though the above  ideas are pure speculations at this  level, the author suggests that 
this kind of behavior -- at least unusual in other parts of the world, for some 19-21 year 
old students that one would expect, at this age, to be full of life, very noisy and difficult 
to bound within a strict set of rules (cid:151) needs further attention from researchers.        
 
This kind of (cid:147)discrete-tempered structure(cid:148) is present at many more levels (cid:151) and actually, 
partially  it  is  a  consequence  of  the  above  discussed  things  (cid:151)  but  in  this  paper,  we  are 

discussing  only  the  consequences  that  affect  student(cid:146)s  ability  of  understanding  and 
reasoning about Physics.    
 

VI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUMMARY 
The  instructional  methods  we  use  as  well  as  the  way  exams  are  designed  should  be 
directly  correlated  with  what  we  want  our  students  to  become.  If  we  want  them,  after 
graduating a college, to become optimally instructed and structured for being best suited 
for  entering  the  real  world  of  business,  where  efficiency  is  mostly  desired,  than,  the 
actual learning system based excessively on MC question exams is the optimal one. But, 
on  the  contrary,  if  we  want  to  focus  the  optimization  process  more  on  the  student--to 
work for the student--than on what the student can do after graduating the college for the 
business  community,  then,  among  others,  a  shift  in  the  way  the  exams  are  designed  is 
suggested. As a matter of fact, the first thing any  interview book(cid:151)as well as,  implicitly 
the whole learning system(cid:151) is teaching a student before going for a job interview, is to 
focus his (or her) speech and thinking in general, on what he can do for the company and 
the business community  in general, and not on what he (or she)  is or can accomplish  in 
general.  
     Bellow I present some of my recommendations: 
 
1) Shift the way exams are held: from almost 100% MC questions to 50% MC questions 
and 50% OE questions (essays, etc). This will result in a diversification of the reasoning 
structure that will benefit from the advantages of both learning systems. 
  
2)  Put  also  emphasize  on  theory-type  of  questions  and  not  only  on  problem-type 
(practical) of questions. This will  force the student to think deeper on the theory, unlike 
the  usual  way  of  just  remembering  few  formulas  that  they  will  have  to  apply  during 
exams. 
 
3) Give students fewer home-works---or at least the interval between two home-works to 
be  larger(cid:151)and harder  final exams. In this way the student will  have a  larger amount of 
time  that  he  can  manage  as  he  likes.  Each  student  have  different  structure  and  studying 
style,  and  is  not  responding  in  the  same  manner  to  the  same  kind  of  imposed  training 
(with  high  density  of  home-works,  and  little  free  time  left  for  himself).  The  successful 
students  on  exams  are  not  necessarily  the  best  students,  but  are  the  students  that  have 
styles  and  learning  structures  more  compatible  with  the  ones  needed  to  be  successful 
within the established set of rules. 
  
4)  Increase  the  level  of  Physics  and  Mathematics  courses  from  high-school.  The  jump 
between  the  high-school  and  university  level  is  too  high  and  too  sudden  for the  student 
reasoning structure not used and not evolved yet to the extent needed to handle such a big 
amount  of  information  and  connections  in  such  a  small  amount  of  time.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  early  study  of  Mathematics  and  Physics  develops  an  analytical  type  of 
reasoning  that  would  facilitate  students  to  better  understand  and  learn  other  subjects  as 
well.   
 

In  this  paper  the  author  tried  to  qualitatively  evaluate  the  long-term  effects  that  two 
different learning systems might have on student(cid:146)s reasoning structure. At extreme cases, 
two  kinds  of  learning  systems  might  exist:  one  totally  based  on  MC  question  exams 
(similar  to  the  American  learning  system),  and  the  other  totally  based  on  OE  question 
exams (resembling the Romanian learning system). Both types of learning systems have 
advantages and disadvantages. Some of them, especially for the MC-type learning system, 
were presented in the paper. The types of reasoning structures associated in the long-run 
with  each  of  the  two  extreme  learning  systems  were  also  presented.  The  experimental 
data obtained from some physics surveys and interviews with two groups of students, one 
from  US  and  the other  from  Romania,  were  presented. Even  though  more  experimental 
data is  needed, a  lot of clear arguments were given to support author(cid:146)s predictions. The 
quantitative results from this paper are not at all a complete clear proof of the validity of 
the  above  qualitative  study,  but  are  not  contradicting  it  either.  Further  measurements 
along these lines are definitely needed.

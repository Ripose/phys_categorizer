Abstract.  The Balmer formula for the spectrum of atomic hydrogen 

is shown to be analogous to that in Compton effect and is written in 

terms of the difference between the absorbed and emitted 

wavelengths. The g-factors come into play when the atom is subjected 

to disturbances (like changes in the magnetic and electric fields), and 

the electron and proton get displaced from their fixed positions giving 

rise to Zeeman effect, Stark effect, etc. 

The Bohr radius (aB) of the ground state of a hydrogen atom, the 

ionization energy (EH) and the Compton wavelengths, λC,e (= h/mec = 

2πre) and λC,p (= h/mpc = 2πrp) of the electron and proton respectively, 

(see [1] for an introduction and literature), are related by the following 

equations,  

 

EH = (1/2)(hc/λH) = (1/2)(e2/κ)/aB                                    (1) 

(λC,e + λC,p) = α2πaB = α2λH = α2/2RH                               (2) 

(λC,e + λC,p) = (λout - λin)C,e + (λout - λin)C,p                           (3) 

α = vω/c = (re + rp)/aB = 2πaB/λH                                       (4) 

aB = (αλH/2π) = c(re + rp)/vω = c(τe + τp) = cτB                  (5) 

where λH is the wavelength of the ionizing radiation, κ = 4πεo, εo is 

the electrical permittivity of vacuum, h (= 2πħ = e2/2εoαc) is the 

Planck constant, ħ (= e2/κvω) is the angular momentum of spin, α (= 

vω/c) is the fine structure constant, vω is the velocity of spin [2], re ( = 

ħ/mec) and rp ( = ħ/mpc) are the radii of the electron and proton [2], me 

and mp are the  rest masses of the electron and proton, RH is the 

Rydberg constant for hydrogen and τe and τp are the periods of spin of 

the electron and proton respectively,  

τe = 1/ωe = re/vω = λC,e/2πvω = ħ/mevωc = λdB,e/c                  (6a) 

τp = 1/ωp = rp/vω = λC,p/2πvω = ħ/mpvωc = λdB,p/c                   (6b) 

                   τB = 1/ωe + 1/ωp = (re + rp)/vω = aB/c = ħ/µHvωc = λdB,H/c      (6c) 

 

where ωe and ωp are the angular spin frequencies (and ħωe and ħωp are 

the corresponding energies) and λdB,e, λdB,p and λdB,H are the de Broglie 

wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation [2] associated with the spin.  

    Equations (2) and (3) show that λH, which appears in the Balmer 

formula [3] for the spectrum of atomic hydrogen is equal to the last 

term in the equation, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

λ[1/(n1)2 (cid:150) (1/n2)2] = λH = (1/α2

)[(λout - λin)C,e + (λout - λin)C,p]      (7a) 

since the Compton wavelengths of the electron and proton, are 

wavelength differences,  between the incident (λin) and emitted 

(scattered) (λout) wavelengths. Thus, one can re-write the Balmer 

formula as, 

λ[1/(n1)2 (cid:150) (1/n2)2] = λH = (1/α2

)[(λout,e + λout,p)C - (λin,e + λin,p)C]   (7b) 

λ/(n1)2 = (1/α2

)(λout,e + λout,p)C = x1λH                                               (7c)  

λ/(n2)2 = (1/α2

)(λin,e + λin,p)C  = x2λH                                                (7d) 

where λ is the wavelength of absorbed or emitted light and n1  and n2  ( 

> n1) are the principal quantum numbers. Thus λ/(n1)2 and λ/(n2)2 give 

important information. 

    Equation (5) gives a new interpretation of aB that it is the distance 

an electromagnetic wave travels in the period τB, which is the sum of 

the periods of spin of the electron and proton.  

    From equations (6), the conservation laws for the linear moment of 

inertia, rotational (spin) moment of inertia and angular momenta are 

obtained, respectively, as,  

                     

(ħ/c) = mere = mprp = µH(re + rp) = µHaBα                           (8a) 

(ħ/vω) = mere/α = mprp/α = µH(re + rp)/α = µHaB                 (8b) 

ħ = merec = mprpc = µH(re + rp)c = µHaBvω                          (8c) 

where µred = memp/(me+ mp)  is the reduced mass of hydrogen. 

     The Bohr radius is also related directly to the magnetic momenta of 

the electron and proton (through their Compton wavelengths λC,e and 

λC,p) as follows: 

λC,e + λC,p = 2π(re + rp) = 4π(µB + µN)/ec = 2παaB       (9a) 

(µB + µN) = eħ/2µH = evωaB/2 = ec(re + rp)/2                 (9b) 

aB = 2(µB + µN)/evω = (αλH/2π)                                    (9c) 

where µB = eħ/2me and µN = eħ/2mp are the Bohr magneton and 

nuclear magneton [1] respectively. The last term in equation (8c) is 

from equation (4) and it shows that λH like aB is directly proportiona 

to the ratio (µB + µN)/e. 

    Since the magnetic moment per unit cross-sectional area (A = πr2) 

is the current in a loop of circumference 2πr at a distance r from the 

center, the following relations hold: 

µB/Ae = ie = (1/2)(ec/Ae)re = (ec/2πre) = e(mec2/h)        (10a) 

µN/Ap = ip = (1/2)(ec/Ap)rp = (ec/2πrp) = e(mpc2/h)        (10b) 

 

    The magnetic momenta of the free electron and proton are 

considered anomalous since they are both greater than µB and µN , 

 

 

 

 

 

µe = (ge/2)µB = (ge/2)ec(re/2) = (ge/2)evω(aB,e/2)               (11a) 

µp = (gp/2)µN = (gp/2)ec(rp/2) = (gp/2)evω(aB,p/2)              (11b) 

where the g-factors (or the magnetic moment anomalies ae and ap) are 

explained as due to the translational displacements δ during spin [2], 

(ge/2) = (1 + ae) = (1 + δre/re)                                                   (12a) 

(gp/2) = (1 + ap) = (1 + δrp/rp)                                                   (12b) 

    Since the g-factors are unity in equations (9), δe = δp = 0 and the 

electron and proton do not have anomalous magnetic momenta while 

bound in the atom. This is in agreement with the fact that λC,e, λC,p and 

aB are fixed values known precisely to several decimal places [1]. The 

g-factors obviously come into play when the atom is subjected to 

disturbances (like changes in the magnetic and electric fields), and the 

electron and proton get free from their fixed positions giving rise to 

changes in λ (Zeeman effect, Stark effect, etc.)

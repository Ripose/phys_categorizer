# - Abstract 
 
 
Classical, Quantum, Relativistic and Statistical: the four branches of mechanics. 
However,  the  Quattro  Donna  of  Physics  disagree  even  about  the  entities  that  are 
supposed to be fundamental, such as space, matter and time. In order to search for an 
union, this contribution considers Indeterminacy in a Classical context and takes a path 
based  on  a  division  that  could  be  named  factual  as  opposed  to  the  conventional 
approach  of  cause  and  effects.  This  sets  back  a  primary  division  between  "observable 
entities"  and  "measurable  quantities".  Recovering  the  primordial  Classical  experiment 
and  describing  the  "Free  Fall"  in  terms  of  distinct  times  –  the  relaxation  time  of  the 
("falling") 'light' bodies ( m1 , m2,...); the characteristic time of the 'heavy' (M) body and  
the  rate  of  change  of  the  mechanical  system  [M,  m1,  m2,  ...]–  the  procedure  led  to 
conclude  that  Newtonian  Mechanics  extracted  data  from  a  gedanken  experiment. 
Developing  the  concept  of  evolution  of  states  (Entropy),  an  argument  centred  on 
Observability  favours  a  uniform  formulation,  at  the  cost  of  non-linear  "Classical" 
equations.  
 
# 1 – Introduction 
 
Historically,  a  label  could  be  set  in  the  year  of  1642  –  birth  of  Newton  and 
passage  of  Galileo  –  considering  this  date  as  a  mark  of  the  transition  from  a 
philosophical  qualitative  description  of  observed  facts  to  a  physical  quantitative  
representation  of  experimental  results;  in  short,  it  is  the  birth  of  controlled  laboratory 
methods.  The  primordial  experiment  of  Mechanics  [1]  follows  the  procedure  of  
measurement and repetition and is pictured in Figure 1: a body m1 is abandoned near the 
proximity  of  a  body  M  and  the  “rate  of  fall ” determined somehow;  however, to gain 
confidence on the result, it is necessary to repeat the experiment, preferably employing 
a distinct body, say m2 .

where h , the 'constant of proportionality',  assumes the value h =  – 1  and, according to 
Classical mechanics,  leads to the second  ( Pi = mivi ) and to the third laws ( Fi = - Fj ). 

However,  figure 1 seems unrealistic once how could one generate, indefinitely,  
masses mi to experiment (balance) with M ? A distinct (view) picture of the Classical 
experiment is shown bellow:

Figure – 2 : Initial, first and second stages of the mechanical experiment. 
 
Comparing figures 1 and 2 we note that there is no place for m2 ( other than on 
the surface of M) when m1 is "falling". Thus figure 1 represents a gedanken experiment, 
in a pure quantum-mechanical sense that it could not be carried out. In other words, the 
transition  from  the  philosophical  qualitative  description  of  facts  to  a  quantitative  
representation  of  experimental  results  was  inconsistently  conducted  by  Classical 
mechanics, leaving the problem of observation to Quantum and Relativistic mechanics.  
 
Now figure 2 pictures a 3-body problem which, as far as  experimental methods 
are  concerned,  is  the  minimum  necessary  arrangement  to  assure  consistent  results; 
according to experimental data, each stage gives:

According to this relation, the  'constant of proportionality' h between the ratio of 

 
masses and the ratio of accelerations assumes the value: 

This  way,  the  "free  fall"  becomes  a  3–body  experiment  and  h  reveals  a 

dependency  on  the  third  part.  A  number  of  interpretations  result:  the  current  one,    
indicating no dependency on M, once mi appears "falling" just in the presence of mj – 
equation (1), meaning no experiment at all ! Independence on mj indicates no repetition, 

  

                                                                  3

or a result based on a single data;  another possibility is that the ( full ) value of h can be 
obtained from the analysis of  the experimental data.

Relations  A.1  to  B.2  represent  four  distinct  results  for  the  "same"  experiment; 
however,  these  are  not  precisely  the  same,  once  addition  of  a  mass  (δM)  to  m1  is 
physically distinct from subtracting a mass (δM)  from m2. 

  

                                                                  4

Classical  mechanics  may  argument  that  h  (α)  is  constant,  that  all  values 
converge to –1; moreover, a direct experiment relating bodies (M + m2) to (M + m1) is 
also  virtual.  However,  the  distinction  of  experiments  is  guaranteed  by  α,  not  by 
employing different lesser bodies m1 and m2 in successive stages. 

 The  argument  of  Quantum  mechanics  could  be  that  the  particular  value  h  (α) 
assumes is irrelevant, since this function is not an observable; so the path followed by 
the light bodies mi from the excited stages to the ground state can not be described by 
the  theory.  Relativistic  mechanics  may  admit  such  a  function  once  a  connection 
between  masses  and  velocities  do  exist,  but  will  argue  that  the  effect  can  only  be 
observed at relativistic velocities. Statistical mechanics is the only that may consider the 
ambiguity and treat h (α) as a description of the path followed by the masses, a function 
that is sensitive to the order of experimentation and takes the responsibility for the fact 
that ideal isolation of the two bodies m1 and m2 could not be achieved. 

This  last  argument  will  now  be  followed,  in  a  study  of  the  evolution  of  the 

mechanical states of the system [M | m1 | m2] . 

...... *** ...... 

# 3 – Evolution of  States: 
 
Figure 3 pictures the evolution of the masses M, m1 and  m2. Three times can be 
 
distinguished: the relaxation time of the bodies m1 and  m2  or the elapsed time of "fall" 
(δti) ; the time interval between observations, or the rate of change of the system (δt). 
The third time is the proper time of M, ∆t. ∆t is also the proper time of  m1 and m2  when 
these are simultaneous with M, such as in stage So .

Relation ( 4 ) reproduces the fact that at time ∆t all the bodies are together and 
 
just come in to observation ( Fig. 3); following this, the stages of the mechanical system

At the initial stage So all the bodies are together, but at the first experimentation 
(stage S1 ) the body m1 is retired from contact with M and m2 . Then m1 follows its own 
way and lasts a “proper time” – δt1 to reach equilibrium. An analogous situation appears 
in stage 3 for the body m2. The negative value indicates that these bodies are relaxing 
back to ∆t , or to equilibrium.  However, due to the evolution of the system, the falling 
bodies  reach  equilibrium  at  a  later  time,  ∆t  +  nδt  (n  =  1,2,...),  where  ∆t  +  nδt  is  the 
proper time of the simultaneous bodies and  δt the time interval between observations.  

Note that δt  ≥  δt1,2  is an experimental condition imposed by the nature of the 
measurement  process:  the  evolution  of  the  mechanical  system  must  be  lower  than  the 
"rate  of  fall"  of  the  (internal)  bodies  m1  and  m2;  this  represents  an  uncertainty  on  the 
observation of δt carried out by the (internal) observer that measures  δt1,2  . 

The change between adjacent steps can be written as :

Conversely,  figure  3  shows  a  dynamical  evolution  of  the  system  [M,m1,m2] 
whereas  each  stage  represents  a  static  picture  of  M,  m1  and  m2;  thus,  as  a  result  of 
evolution,  each stage can also be represented as:

opposed  to  the  static  picture.  Now,  two  ways  of  evolution  can  be  distinguished: 
evolution 'A', when the first experiment is the "free fall" of body m1  and the second the 
“ free fall “ of body m2 and evolution 'B' when the first experiment is the "free fall" of 
body m2  and the second the “ free fall “ of body m1 . The changes for these two cases 
can now be computed.

This result is independent of the choice of the light bodies, since no matter  

 m1 = m2 + δM  or  m2  =  m1 + δM , the value of ∆S remains the same. 

Thus experimentation gives rise to distinct results, according to the order of the 
procedure. Conversely, the act of experimentation disturbs the system, in a sense that it 
does not return to the same configuration; the changes related to each of the masses M, 
m1 and m2 can also be calculated. Choosing evolution 'B' , the last (accumulated) change

Equation  (10)  has  a  form  similar  to  equation  (1):  velocities  take  the  place  of 
accelerations  and  the  ratio  of  masses  are  substituted  by  the  'ratio  of  states';  also,  the 
motion of the [m1 | m2] subsystem probably occurs in the direction of minimum relative 
∆S  changes  and  equations  (8),  (9)  and  (10)  seems  to  conform  with  the  Principle  of 
Inertia.    Moreover,  though  equations  (  8.2  )  and  (  8.3  )  were  written  in  terms  of  the 
variables of the bodies m1 and m2 , equation (10) inserts the h function as a connection 
with  the  motion  of  the  system  as  a  whole;  this  opens  the  possibility  to  interpret  the 
different values of h as distinct paths that the light bodies (m1 , m2) may follow on their 
way  back  to  equilibrium,  a  ‘classical’  uncertainty  in  the  motion  of  the  mechanical 
system.  Conversely,  this  function  is  directly  related  to  the  picture  of  Newtonian 
mechanics represented by figure 3, so the explicit introduction of the time of the system 
in  the  Classical  formalism  requires  an  analysis  of  the  meaning  of  δt  in  the  context  of 
indetermination.  

Nature  registers  the  existence  of  three  distinct  temporalities  and  strongly 
indicates  a  fourth  component,  while  physics  deals  with  just  two.  The  temporalities  of 
physics  are  the  system's  time  and  sensor's  time;  that  of  Nature  are  past,  present  and 
future; the fourth component is atemporality. 

Atemporality  does  not  belong  to  the  nature  of  measurable  effects,  but  to  the 
reality of facts; also, it does not mean that there is no time but that all times collapse. 
Thus, there is a primordial indeterminacy on describing the facts of reality by means of 
the effects of nature. Moreover, physical systems are taken as evolving in time (external 
parameter)  but  detected  on  time,  or  at  time,  by  a  detector  somehow  connected  to  the 
system ( internal parameter). 

The  condition  δt    ≥    δt1,2  reflects  an  uncertainty  between  facts  and  effects, 
observation  of  the  motion  of  the  system  and  measurement  or  determination  of  the 
motion of a part of the system,  m1 or m2 .  δt  <  δt1,2  implies an indeterminacy on the 
measurement of the motion of the bodies m1 and m2 ; δt = 0 implies no observation of 
the motion of the system [ M, m1 , m2 ], since both the variation of the process (7) and 
that of the heavier body (M)  (8.1), present a null result. 

In  fact,  the  evolution  of  the  system  [  M,  m1  ,  m2  ]  is  an  attribute  of  external 
observation  and  can  only  be  sensed    by  an  internal  observer  by  means  of  the  internal 
fluctuations of the system; thus, the time δt can only be estimated by the measurement 
of  δt1,2  .  In  this  sense,  δt1,2  is  a  measurable  quantity  while  δt  is  an  observable  entity. 
That  is  to  say,  the  experimental  point  of  disagreement  among  the  branches  of 
mechanics,  setting  back  a  division  between  experimental  entities  –  the  ones  resulting 
from  detectable  effects  of  nature  –    and  'just'  observable  entities,  those  associated  to 
facts of reality, whose detection demands a conceptual operation.    

The question of observability [3] plays a central hole in mechanics and generates 
many debates both at the classical end but mainly at the quantum and relativistic levels; 
in particular, observability of time is questioned so that quantities that change with time 

  

                                                                  9

are also under suspicion. On the other hand, it is argued that observable is a (relative) 
quantity  expressing  a  balance  (correlation)  among  dynamical  variables  of  the  system. 
The  overall  discussion  has  to  do  with  localisation  in  space  and  also  in  time;  but  
localisation  in  time  seems  unrealistic  once  time  is in side physical bodies; perhaps on 
time, or at time. This way, sequencing of events – the practical version of  Causality – 
appears as the conceptual (erroneous/erratic) counterpart of time observability, since it 
involves time uncertainty and/or time dilation. 

Note, also, that equation (10) correlates observable entities – the ratio of states – 
to  measurable  quantities,  the  ratio  of  velocities.  Further,  the  conceptual  notion  of 
Causality  becomes  erratic,  once  h,  apart  from  the  ambiguity,  is  a  function  of  the 
(internal) dynamical variables of the system. 

The  classical  formulation  of  mechanics  does  not  require  the  concept  of  proper 
time δt1,2 neither that of the external time δt, explicitly. In such a context, neglecting the 
changes  of  the  system,  observability  is  set  inside  the  system  and  mixed  with 
experimentation  so  that  the  results  reveal  a  linear  relationship  between  the  bodies 
subjected to the experiment. From the perspective of an external observer – the one that 
pictured  (photographed)  the  stages  of  Fig. 3 – observation and measurement are quite 
distinct once they are not exactly at the same time, that is, in the same place. 

Relativistic  mechanics  provides  a  solution  for  this  problem  by  transporting  the 
data of the experiment to the observer, at the cost of a time dilation; quantum mechanics 
solves the problem at the cost of  momentum–position / time-energy uncertainty. Here 
the  problem  was  settled    by  removing  the  constraint    ∆t  =  δt1,2  =  δt  .    The  implicit 
argument  is  that  the  δt1,2  =  δt  constraint  can  be  removed  by  quantum  mechanical 
methods while the ∆t = δt1,2 by relativistic ones.  

The  correlation  among  δt  ,  ∆t  and    δt1,2  appears  as  a  function  h  ,  which  is  a 
relation  among  dynamical  variables  of  the  system;  more  precisely,  the  quantity  S 
originally  defined  in  terms  of  proper  times.  Conversely,  definition  of  time  is  state 
dependent  once  there  is  an  uncertainty  on  determination  of  states;  thus,  time  is 
determined only statistically (thermodynamically or statistical mechanics sense) and the 
only  temporality  that  rests  at  the  mechanical  level  is  atemporality;  the  proper  time  in 
physical bodies appears only connected to the motion ( action ). 

Solid  state  physics  deals  with  the  notion  of  carriers,  charge-carriers,    such  as 
electrons  and  holes  in  the  theory  of  semiconductors;  analogously,  mechanics  can  say 
that physical bodies are time–carriers.  Removing body m1  from contact with bodies M 
and m2 means subtraction of a quantity δt1 ; return of the time-carrier m1 to contact with 
the  time  reservoir  (∆t  +  nδt)  represented  by  M  (and  m2)  means  that  a  time  δt1  has 
elapsed and that the m1 body lost his proper time. 

Finally,  the  quantity  S  defined  by  (4)  represents  –  according  to  (4.1)  –  the 
evolution of the system. Moreover, the change in S between any two equilibrium states 
(equations  5.1,2  /  6.A,B)  is  found  by  taking  the  system  along  the  path  connecting  the 
states, dividing the mass added to the system at each point of the path by the time of the 
system and summing the quotients thus obtained. Thus a quantity given by 

Mδ
∑ t

  

is equal  to the difference between the values of the function S at the end points of the 
path. This function has all the ingredients attributed to Entropy. Thus, assuming that the 
definition stated by (4) do represent the state of the mechanical system [ M, m1 , m2 ], 
the  quantity  S  should  be  considered  as  a  'classical'  Entropy,    neglected  in  the  original 
Newtonian formalism of mechanics.

Also, considering the reality of the motion (V) of bodies (M) throughout space 

 
(∆X), the quantity S can be written as MV/∆X, that is:

Thus,  tough  the  abstract  entity  named  time  appears  useful  for  measurable 
purposes  and  physical  descriptions  such  as  equation  (4)  or  figure  3,  explicit 
computations show that the real physical flow can be settled in terms of the dynamical 
variables of the system.

# 5 –  Conclusions 
 

This  contribution  reviews  the  original  experiment  (formulation)  of  Classical 
Mechanics centring the discussion on Indeterminacy instead of Causality. Analysis of a 
more realistic experiment ( Fig. 3 ) leads to multiple solutions, expressed by the values 
of h(α), revealing that the classical results are based on a gedanken experiment and on a 
single  data  (α  →  0  ).  Application  of  a  simple  description  of  the  motion,  without  any 
attempt to quantification other than the original Newtonian results, indicates that the act 
of experimentation disturbs the evolution of the system. 

Employing  the  concept  of  Mechanical  States,  those  distinct  results  can  be 
associated to variations of the order (Entropy) of the mechanical system [ M| m1| m2]. 
This  demands  for  an  explicit  distinction  between  facts  and  effects,  or  removal  of  the 
constraint between observable entities and measurable quantities. 

Expressed in terms of time – proper times and change of rate of the system – the 
constraint  was  removed  employing  quantum  and  relativistic  arguments  based  on  a 
statistical (thermodynamically sense) notion of time. Finally, since any representation of 
physical reality must be settled in terms of the dynamical variables of the system, the 
possibility to write the quantity S in terms of masses, velocities and space was shown. 

Development  of  a  formalism  centred  on  the  arguments  here  described,  mainly  the 
concept  of  State/Entropy,  may  open  the  possibility  to  an  uniform  synthesis  of  the 
branches of mechanics, provided that a comprehensive method of motion detection can 
be envisaged.

ABSTRACT 

It has always been considered a serious error to treat the cosmological redshift as a Doppler 
velocity effect rather than the result of space expansion. It is demonstrated here that in 
practical terms this is not the case, and that the apparent distance - redshift relation derived 
from a Doppler interpretation is consistent with supernova data. The normal Doppler effect 
is examined in detail and shown to conserve energy as expected. Because of the equivalence 
between the general relativistic space expansion paradigm and the Doppler effect (as 
demonstrated) the long-standing problem of energy loss associated with the expansion of the 
Universe is treated in a similar manner to the normal well-behaved Doppler effect. The 
mechanism by which energy is conserved with the normal Doppler shift is applied to the 
cosmological redshift and the energy violation disappears. However, an additional 
luminosity-dependent recession factor is introduced. The effect on astronomical objects is 
examined and it is found to add only a small additional redshift to a body generating power 
by nuclear means but can be very large for objects powered by gravity. A possible 
connection to the claimed anomalous redshift of quasars is considered. 

 

1. Introduction 

It is well established that the cosmological redshift originates from a general-relativistic 
process with the spectral ratio being a measure of the scale factor of the Universe at the epochs 
of observation and emission1. The apparent motion resulting from the expansion of space 
cannot be rightly considered as a proper velocity, but there is still a tendency to erroneously 
apply the relativistic Doppler formula to the measured redshift and derive an equivalent 
recession velocity, effectively transferring the process into the special relativistic domain¶. 
When the geometrical effect of the space expansion is correctly transformed into an apparent 
velocity, the value is actually equal to the Doppler velocity when distances are short relative to 
the dimensions of the Universe because both formulae approximate to the linear Hubble law 
under that constraint 2. However it would seem the equivalence can not possibly hold at large 
distances. In the expanding space paradigm the apparent velocity is permitted to exceed the 
speed of light (with the point of equality defining the observer horizon). This is not possible in 
the context of special relativity. It is perhaps because of this obvious and significant divergence 
that no attempt has been made to examine observational data to quantify the discrepancy at 
high z when the Doppler formula is incorrectly applied in place of the Robertson-Walker 
metric.  

 In this paper, the redshift-apparent distance relationship of distant supernovae is examined. 
Perhaps surprisingly, it is found that the luminosity distance obtained by deriving the Doppler 
equivalent velocity from z and applying special relativity to the propagation process is 
completely consistent with observation, but only if the Universe is assumed to be flat and 
empty in relation to the Hubble expansion; in other words if we are consistently special 
relativistic. In practical terms therefore, the use of the Doppler velocity expression is an 
acceptable approximation (and simplification) of Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) 
cosmology so long as one is careful with the form of the Hubble relation. 

One problematic aspect of the cosmological expansion is the apparent loss of energy 
associated with the redshift. The effect is particularly bad with cosmological background

¶ Perhaps the reason why this interpretation is so deeply ingrained is the visual appeal of  the model of the 
expanding Universe as a hypersurface with an expansion velocity (and equivalent kinetic energy) working 
against gravity and large-scale cosmological forces. The model makes it difficult to conceptualise the 
difference between proper and expansion velocities.

photons received in the current epoch – they are received with only about 0.1% of their 
emission energy. Attempts to account for the missing energy within the framework of general 
relativity have met with severe problems because of the difficulty in defining a local 
gravitational energy density (gravitational energy cannot be expressed in tensor form). As a 
result, it is widely accepted that energy is not locally conserved in general relativity3, although 
claims are made that energy is globally conserved during expansion. This is in stark contrast to 
the normal Doppler shift where, as demonstrated in the text, energy is conserved on a photon-
by-photon basis. We are surely entitled to demand that photons redshifted by the cosmological 
expansion similarly conform. Having established a working equivalence between a Doppler 
velocity and the cosmological expansion, an attempt is made here to apply the Doppler energy 
conservation ‘recipe’ to the cosmological shift to explore concepts that may later be 
transferable to general relativity to recover energy conservation. We avoid the normal 
unproductive approach of associating the missing energy to unknown field properties; instead, 
the ‘missing’ energy is accounted for by an apparent kinematic change at the source to 
guarantee energy conservation in the observer frame.   

Though speculative, the analysis does suggest that energy conservation is possible through 
the introduction of an additional luminosity-dependent redshift term that evolves according to 
the mass-to-light ratio of the bound system. It is important to emphasise that this is not strictly 
speaking an ‘intrinsic’ redshift because the value varies with observer distance. When applied 
to cosmological entities, the luminosity redshift is seen to contribute only a small amount to the 
total cosmological redshift of systems generating energy through nuclear processes but can 
overwhelm the cosmological effect in systems powered by gravitation such as active galactic 
nuclei. The actual proportion in this latter case is strongly dependent on the mass of the central 
black hole, the accretion rate and the radiative efficiency.  

2. The Relativistic Doppler Effect 

The Doppler shift will be analysed in some detail to demonstrate that energy is always 
conserved, both globally and locally (i.e. for each photon). Comprehensive calculations are 
included as the results are important to the analysis of the cosmological redshift that is the main 
focus of the paper.  

Consider two masses A and B separated by a distance r with A moving at velocity v with 

respect to B (Figure 1).

b is defined as |v|/c and g = (1-b2)-1/2.  This is the Doppler shift. Visible light may have the 
wavelength increased towards the red end of the spectrum or decreased towards the blue. The 
relation is readily derived by Lorentz transforming the system four-vectors and using the 
invariance of the scalar product of the source and photon four-momenta5.

The relativistic Doppler shift has two components: the Doppler term (1-bcosj) is analogous 

to the acoustic Doppler effect and is dependent upon angle; the transverse term g, the time 
dilatation factor, has no acoustic analogue and arises because, unlike sound in air, the velocity 
of light is a constant independent of reference frame. The transverse term is sometimes referred 
to as the anomalous, perpendicular or second order Doppler effect. The correctness of equation 
(1) has been established to an extraordinary level of accuracy by a recent experiment6. 

Consider the case of an isotropic light source of luminosity L radiating photons of 

wavelength l. Assume a set of stationary observers on the spherical surface at distance r. The 
flux, f, measured by each observer is  

f

If the source is instantaneously accelerated to a velocity v as shown in Figure 2, then each 

observer notes a change in the flux after a due propagation delay.

Consider first the limited case where j =p ¶. The energy flux measured by the observer is 
reduced by a factor (1+z)4 in comparison with equation (3) (see, for example, Misner, Thorne 
and Wheeler1, sections 22.6 and 29.4). The four powers of (1+z) include a combination of local 
and global effects. The energy of each photon is reduced by (1+z). The received photon count is 
reduced by the same factor. There is an additional (1+z)2 diminution in flux because the 
absorber in the moving frame lies on the surface of a sphere of radius equal to the rest-frame 
separation times (1+z) - the effective photon journey time (distance) is longer by this factor. Of 
course, this analysis assumes a point source. A real source will appear extended and energy 
over the full extent of the source must be integrated for the (1+z)4 flux reduction to apply. 

The analysis is slightly different for extended sources where the surface brightness is the 

appropriate parameter rather than the luminosity, for example, the cosmic microwave 
background radiation (CMBR). In Appendix A, it is demonstrated that a blackbody spectrum of 
a source at temperature T in the rest frame is transformed to a blackbody spectrum of lower 
temperature T/(1+z) if a source recession velocity as defined by equation (2a) is applied. The 
fact that the CMBR data is verified to have the form of a blackbody spectrum to high accuracy7 
shows that, for this specific example, the general-relativistic space expansion can be equated to 
an equivalent proper velocity and treated with special relativity.  

 Referring to Figure 2, the diminution of flux can be generalised for observers at all angles j 

as [g(1-bcosj)]4.   We will determine the luminosity of the moving source by integrating the 
emitted radiation over the closed surface on which the observers reside. The distortion of the 
sphere by the Lorentz boost makes the integration a bit messy as the surface is no longer 
spherical. However, if two of the powers are dropped, the absorption surface is transformed 
back to a sphere (converting to angular distance). The total luminosity in the moving frame L(cid:1) is 
therefore

The last line of simplification follows from equation (3). 

Although individual photon energy alters as a result of the velocity boost, the luminosity of 

the source does not vary. Energy is globally conserved. This does not mean that energy 
conservation is maintained by some form of collusion between blue-shifted photons with a 
surplus of energy and red-shifted photons with a deficit: we can show that energy is locally

conserved for each photon by a simple kinematic derivation of the Doppler shift expression. 
For each photon the difference in energy associated with the wavelength shift is actually 
balanced by a kinetic energy change at the source. Of course, this automatically follows from 
the transformation of the four-vectors used to derive equation (1) but the alternative derivation 
below is more illuminating. 

 Let the source have an equivalent rest mass M and let the photon emission in the rest frame 

correspond to a loss of mass of DM. The equivalent photon energy, Elo is DMc2 and the 
momentum is DMc. From the observer frame the total energy of the source is

Since the momentum in this case is in the x direction only, only the partial equation in x need 

be considered. If El is the photon energy measured from the moving frame, ¶E = - El. and 
because ¶M = -Elo/c2, equation (8) becomes 

In the observer frame, the change in momentum in the x direction is -El cos j /c. Note that 
the momentum projection onto the y axis can be ignored because vy is instantaneously 0 hence 
has no effect on the source energy (this is why the y and z partials of equation (8) were ignored; 
see Appendix B for further discussion of this point). The equation becomes 

consistent with equation (1) after taking into account that E (cid:181) l-1. In effect the photon recoil 
changes the velocity and kinetic energy of the source, taking up the energy difference. Of 
course the source must be isotropic if the velocity in the y direction is to remain zero. For an 
isotropic source, the velocity in the x direction will also remain globally constant from 
symmetry considerations and the principle of relativity (a Lorentz boost cannot introduce an 
acceleration). Non-isotropic sources can be created using mirrors but it is shown in Appendix B 
that anisotropic sources also respect energy conservation. The analysis concluded here verifies 
the Doppler effect conserves energy on a photon-by-photon basis. 

3.  The Cosmological Redshift 

The systematic redshift of distant galaxies is interpreted as the expansion of the space 

between galaxies. If a(t) is the scale factor or size of the Universe at epoch t, it can be 
demonstrated1 that the cosmological redshift is related to the scale factor by

In principle, the form of the function a(t) can be deduced from a comparison of the measured 
flux and luminosity of standard candles over a range of z values. This is objective of the High-Z 
Supernova Search Team9 and the Supernova Cosmology Project10.   

Robertson11 confirmed the (1+z)4 dimming with redshift with the general-relativistic 
expansion model previously derived by Tolman which is consistent with the present nature of 
the CMBR¶. 

4. Doppler Velocity-Distance Relation for Type Ia Supernovae 

It is commonplace to interpret the cosmological redshift as arising from proper motion and 

to determine the velocity using the Doppler expression of equation (2a). This is clearly 
incompatible with the general-relativistic description of the cosmological expansion. Harrison 2 
in his section 6.1 states that it is not possible to extract the velocity from z and relate this to the 
linear Hubble law V(z) = H(t)de  (where de is the proper distance). However ,his reason for 
rejecting the procedure is based on the incompatibility of the FRW and Doppler velocity 
models not observational data. In practice, is it really such a bad assumption to make? Are the 
errors serious? Narlikar12 and Longair13 claim the error is fundamental and significant but again 
fail to quantify the comments. It is difficult to make a simple comparison because the Doppler 
effect is dependent only on the conditions at the photon emission and absorption points; in the 
FRW model, changes in the rate of space expansion during propagation affect the redshift 
hence an integration over history is required to get a parametric solution.  

In this section we will take a pragmatic approach to the dispute and try to quantify the error 
that is actually introduced when the Doppler velocity is assumed by making a comparison with 
observational data. In this way, we may determine the z-domain over which the assumption is 
acceptable and perhaps legitimise its use. 

We can initially make a rough theoretical calculation and show that for small z, the two 

formalisms are equivalent. Equating the Doppler and general relativistic derivations of z: 

The size of the universe at emission time is therefore related to the apparent velocity by

which is the Hubble law. We have not been particularly careful with the proper distance or even 
the current value of the Hubble constant (simply equating it to the inverse of the current age of 
the Universe) but the approximate equivalence at low z is clear. 

We are more interested in what is happening at high z where a clear divergence is expected 

and this will be investigated by considering the relationship between the apparent brightness 
and redshift of type Ia supernovae. The procedure followed is to take the same set of 
supernovae currently being used to determine the form factor of the Universe in Friedmann-
Robertson-Walker cosmology9, 10 and derive a Doppler velocity from each measured z using 
equation (2a). The photon-travel distance¶, or retarded distance, is found from the apparent 
magnitude for each point by deriving the apparent distance and multiplying by a single power 
of (1+z) to correct for the photon energy reduction and dilution effects (the source is treated 
special relativistically). The procedure is applied over a wide range of z values to derive a 
Hubble-type relation. The deviation of this Hubble relation from the general-relativistic value is 
then examined. 

If the data is corrected for host galaxy extinction and the K-correction is applied, the

M is the absolute magnitude and m is the apparent magnitude. Riess and his team9 have 
provided both new and recalculated m-M magnitudes for a large number of supernovae. Knop 
and the Supernova Cosmology project team10 give only the apparent magnitude. Data from 
both groups is used in our analysis, specifically:

Note  that  there  is  a  certain  amount  of  overlap  (SN  1995ax,  SN  1996cl,  SN  1887R,  and 
SN1997ap) that illustrates how the data analysis of each group results in a different final value. 
The data is plotted in Figure 3. 

                                                 
¶ The reason for using the photon travel time is that the normal Doppler effect relies only on the relative 
velocity at emission and reception. For consistency, an equivalent expansion velocity should rely on the 
parameters that relate to the photon emission and absorption. In the case of the cosmological expansion, the 
significant parameter is time. We do not perform a second division by (1+z) because the rest separation is 
not considered relevant.

We assume the retarded distance - velocity plot will be linear (extrapolating from Hubble’s 
law).  Two  points  that  must  fall  on  this  straight  line  are  known:  (0,0)  -  the  velocity  is  0  at 
distance 0; (1, -13.7Gyr x c) -  this is data from the CMBR – the equivalent Doppler velocity is 
almost c and the retarded time is approximately the age of the Universe, about 13.7 Gyr. The 
straight line through these two points is shown in Figure 3. It actually represents a good fit for 
the  data,  but  only  if  an  absolute  magnitude  of  –19.95  is  assumed  for  the  type  Ia  supernovae 
from  the  Knop  team.  An  intrinsic  variability  range of  –0.5 magnitude  for  type  Ia  supernovae 
makes all the data consistent except for a few outliners. The datum in Figure 3 with the highest 
plotted  value  of  v/c  is  the  notable  supernovae  SN  1997ff.  It  simply  lies  on  the  line  in  this 
model. 

A  peak  absolute  magnitude  of  –19.95  is  rather  brighter  than  is  generally  accepted.  For 
example Wang14 estimates a value of –19.33 – 0.25, but nevertheless it is fair to conclude that 
it  is  legitimate  to  represent  the  cosmological  expansion  with  an  equivalent  Doppler  velocity 
over the entire range of z up to the horizon with the following caveats:

Of course, this is equivalent to equation (16) at low z. 

2. The Universe is between 13.7 and 14.0 Gyr old (the value that is used for To in equation 
(18)) 

The special relativistic treatment is also consistent with the supernova relativistic light curve 

lengthening as the same factor (1+z) is obtained. 

Of course, equation (18) has to be largely consistent with all types of observational data, not 
just distant supernovae. As a further example we can consider the variation of angular width of 
standard rods with redshift. This is important because proper distance is more difficult to 
reconcile with the retarded frame used here. For this reason we would expect differences 
between the Doppler and general-relativistic model predictions.  

Consider a ‘standard rod’ of length l = 10/h pc¶ (measured with rod and observer at relative 
rest). There is some doubt as to whether standard rods genuinely exist but some data on radio 
sources is available15 and whilst the scatter is large, an averaging process can produce data 
against which the reasonableness of a cosmology can be tested (although it is unlikely a 
specific cosmology can be selected).

where de is proper separation distance. Following a velocity boost (in the Doppler formalism), 
the observer maps the stationary circumference 2pde to the circumference 2pde(1+z) onto which 
objects are projected hence the apparent length is scaled by a factor (1+z). The distance is also 
scaled by (1+z) so the apparent angular width remains unchanged. The distance de can be 
derived from observables using a modified equation (18): de = vT/(1+z). Converting the 
angular measurement units from radians to mas, and taking l to be 14.0 (= 10/0.714) pc,

Redshift and Energy Conservation 

5. The Cosmological Redshift and Energy Conservation 

The cosmological expansion appears not to conserve energy. Photons are received with a 
lower energy than when emitted and because the source appears to be moving away from all 
the distant absorbers, there is no obvious mechanism by which energy can be conserved – all 
photons lose energy. Ideas involving a variation in gravitational energy or zero-point energy as 
space expands tend to fail because the expansion is determined by matter density and to balance 
the energy loss we would have to postulate local variations in expansion based on photon 
density. Whilst these ideas are very appealing and evolve fascinating space-time topologies, 
they ultimately fail to satisfy energy conservation requirements.  

Exploiting the working equivalence between a Doppler velocity and the expansion and using 
equation (18), a previous paper16 argued that energy could be conserved from the viewpoint of 
the emitter if a distant absorber subject to the cosmological expansion were attributed an 
‘Hubble Energy’. It was shown that this could give rise to anomalous accelerations similar to 
that experienced by the Pioneer probes. In this paper, we will instead consider the situation 
from the viewpoint of the absorber and explore the possibility that the supposed energy loss 
associated with the cosmological redshift can be dealt with in a manner analogous to the 
Doppler shift described earlier.  

Consider an object subject to the cosmological expansion. The radiation power loss is 

proportional to the luminosity L and the observer distance. If we consider the source  
‘surrounded’ by a set of observers on the surface of a sphere of radius r, the total integrated 
power loss is zL/(1+z). The apparent momentum gain at the source is L/c(1+z) away from the 
observer. The assumption is made that the momentum associated with all the photons can be 
added in a scalar fashion, even though they are emitted in different directions – this means that 
even if the output is beamed, the cosmological momentum change is the same for all observers 
regardless of the angle of orientation with respect to the beam. By analogy with the Doppler 
equation, we can postulate an increase in the recession velocity equivalent to the momentum 
change. Consideration of equation (8) shows this procedure conserves both energy and 
momentum. The increase in cosmological velocity, per second, is

All velocities are assumed to be cosmological. We can get an idea of the accumulated effect 

by assuming the source has had the same mass-to-light ratio from T = 0 up to the time the 
photon was emitted, Te. Multiplying Dv by Te and using equation (18), the accumulated increase 
in velocity is

The subscript l indicates an ‘luminosity’ velocity which gives rise to a ‘luminosity redshift’.  

The value of To is taken as 13.7 Gyr and P is the mass-to-light ratio in units of M(cid:1)/L(cid:1).    

This type of crude calculation would be appropriate to relatively near galaxies. The mass-to-

light ratio by galaxy type is remarkable constant. Faber and Gallagher17 give estimates for a 
range of galaxy morphologies. For example, the value of P for a type Scd galaxy is 3.9. Slotting 
this into equation (24) and assuming v/c is small, the increase in velocity is about 72 km/s. S0- 
galaxies by comparison give a value of about 28 km/s. This might offer an explanation for the 
tendency of smaller galaxies (Sc I) to have a systematically larger redshift18. Note that the 
effect cannot be related to the observation that young, blue stars to have an anomalous 
redshift19– stars in our galaxy do not have a cosmological velocity component therefore there 
can be no luminosity velocity component. It should be noted that luminosity velocity 
component can decay with time as the galaxy attracts non-luminous matter such as hydrogen

gas or dark matter – the velocity drops through conservation of (cosmological) momentum:  
m1v1 = [m1 + dm][v1 - dv] where dm and dv are both positive.  

To summarise, energy and momentum conservation require that distant objects have an 
additional cosmological velocity component proportional to their integrated luminosity. The 
effect on galaxies is small but measurable and is generally distance independent. The effect 
would show up as a discrepancy between the redshift and Tully-Fisher or supernova calculated 
distances. 

The additional velocity cannot be associated with to a physical change in position (radial 

distance) otherwise the ordering of events can be changed in an acausal way. It therefore 
follows that the source is at the position indicated by the cosmological element of the recession 
velocity and that this additional luminosity component be intrinsic to the observer (not the 
source). In what sense can it therefore be considered a velocity? This question is left open for 
the moment. Remember the luminosity component represents energy conservation and the 
actual mechanism is unimportant – any mechanism with these conservation properties will have 
the same observable effect. 

 

 

6. Cosmological Redshift and Quasars (QSOs) 

For some systems it more appropriate to consider the total energy loss over the lifetime of 
the source rather than on the basis of small time intervals. Let M be the original total mass of 
the source, and x the fraction of mass eventually converted into energy. The total increase in 
intrinsic velocity is of the order

(25) 

For a compact or extended source (i.e. a star or galaxy) powered by nuclear reactions, x  has 
a value of about 0.001 and the redshift change is of the same order (consistent with the normal 
galaxy mass-to-light ratio applied to equation (24)).  The situation is very different in the case 
of an accreting black hole (BH). The power generation mechanism is then gravitational and x 
can then be identified as the radiative efficiency, a factor whose value is typically believed to 
be about 0.1 but can approach 1, the latter case being where all incident mass is converted to 
energy. As an example, if we consider a BH accreting with a radiative efficiency of 0.9, and 
with a cosmological value of z of 0.1 (based on distance), the measured redshift would be z @ 3. 
It is therefore possible that active galactic nuclei may have a large redshift associated with 
luminosity mixed in with the cosmological redshift¶.  

The most visible evidence of galactic core activity is QSOs. There has been a long running 

dispute over the nature of QSOs and whether they are really located at the redshift distance. 
The main points of each side of the argument will be considered and we will judge whether the 
notion of a luminosity redshift is consistent with observational data and can help resolve the 
dispute with the standard cosmological model§.  

The first point that strongly favours the standard interpretation of AGNs in general and 
QSOs in particular is that there exists a reasonable theory that not only explains many of the 
observations but actually unifies apparent disparate objects into a single schema20. However, 
the observational data available is limited, and the model has not been rigorously tested. It is 

                                                 
¶ Note that it is not just the active nucleus that has the additional redshift. It affects all the bound mass, 
including the host galaxy. The conservation redshift cannot be determined by comparing the host and core 
redshifts. 
§ Care is taken to avoid the definition of an intrinsic redshift as the value is relative to the observer and is 
thus not strictly intrinsic. 

- 12 - 

 
 
 
Redshift and Energy Conservation 

rather difficult to make redshift comparison over the full extent of an active galaxy: the jet 
frequently associated with AGNs is often the most visible component but generally produces 
radiant energy by synchrotron radiation - there is no spectral information from which to obtain 
a redshift.  Certainly the redshift can be extracted from the core emission, the source being the 
central accretion zone, but only occasionally can light from the host galaxy be resolved. This 
fact that the host galaxy can sometimes be resolved is again strongly suggestive of QSOs being 
truly distant objects. On the occasions when resolution is possible, there is no example of the 
host galaxy having a different redshift to the central active region. This indicates there is little 
gravitational redshift associated with emission from around the central black hole and severely 
restricts alternative explanations. A QSO lifetime of 106 – 108 years is estimated21, activity 
presumably beginning as gas coalesces to form the galaxy and finishing when the nearby matter 
has been consumed. The supply of additional material through galactic collisions and mergers 
is thought to reactivate the process later in the lifetime of a galaxy.  

We can immediately discount alternative models that consider all QSO redshift to be 
intrinsic with the sources actually stars in the galaxy - the idea presumably arises from the 
similarity to jets from young stars and micro-quasars in the galaxy. The idea fails because the 
source distribution is generally isotropic with no correlation with the galactic plane. Arp has 
suggested an alternative mechanism for QSO activity based on observed QSO-galaxy 
associations. In Arp’s model22, QSOs are ejected from parent galaxies, initially with a high 
intrinsic redshift, but with the redshift declining with time as the quasar evolves into a normal 
galaxy. The idea is given some theoretical credence by the notion of particles being created at 
galactic cores with initially zero mass but acquiring their normal mass over time. Part, but not 
all the redshift is intrinsic by this model. 

Comparing the standard and Arp’s idea, an HST survey of 20 near-QSOs23 has resolved the 
host galaxies. Most galaxies are normal and do not show evidence of the mergers that would be 
expected to trigger late QSO activity. However many had galactic companions close by (at 
about the same redshift), which is largely consistent with Arp’s model, but the authors 
interpreted the associations as a merging rather than diverging process. Luminous QSOs are 
associated with a young host stellar population24 and there is a tendency for the host to be 
brighter than normal galaxies, again in accordance with Arp’s observations. Recent attempts25 
failed to resolve host galaxies of quasars at z ~ 2. This would be expected from Arp’s model 
where these are considered very young objects that have not yet formed galaxies. 

One problem with Arp’s model is that if this is the way galaxies are produced then all QSOs 
should be associated with galaxies. In fact the anomalous associations affect only a very small 
proportion of objects. Is it reasonable to expect there to be two very different mechanisms for 
quasar production to be at work? Another problem is that the supporting theory of mass 
creation is far removed from established physics with no rationale for the process in the 
standard particle model or indications of it from high-energy experiments. As such there is no 
corroborating evidence. 

However Arp’s observations do appear to be reasonable and should not be dogmatically 
rejected, and in fact the limited anomalous data is readily incorporated into a standard model 
augmented with luminosity redshift. We may consider one process whereby galaxies may form 
to show how the anomalies might arise. Active nuclei eject huge volumes of material through 
the jet and counter jet often present. As the ejecta is slowed by the interstellar medium, it is 
natural to assume that gravity will draw the matter together. We would expect a BH to rapidly 
form and efficiently accrete, appearing as a QSO. Peripheral gaseous material is gravitationally 
attracted but not initially gravitationally bound; the mass-to-light ratio of the luminous source 
will be core dominated and therefore very low, resulting in an anomalously large redshift (by 
equation (25)). As peripheral material loses kinetic energy through collisions, the bound mass 
will increase (without a corresponding increase in energy output) hence the mass-to-light ratio 
will fall. We might therefore expect galaxies to begin as QSOs with an initially high anomalous 
redshift that decays to that of a normal older galaxy over time as the body of the galaxy forms 

- 13 - 

 
 
 
Redshift and Energy Conservation 

and stars begin to shine - perfectly consistent with Arp’s observations. The short duration of 
QSO activity would indicate that it contributes little to the overall luminosity redshift over the 
lifetime of the galaxy and we would expect to see little residual redshift in older nearby 
galaxies. A second phase of QSO activity would not result in a significant anomalous redshift. 
By this process, we might expect to observe a small number of quasars caught in the early act 
of galaxy creation with a significant anomalous redshift but the vast majority in the later stage 
of quasar activity or a later triggering with little or no anomalous redshift. This is consistent 
with observation and for the most part QSOs will be at the redshift distance.  

This is very speculative of course, but the notion of galaxies ejecting material, the ejection 

material forming galaxies which in turn eject, and so on, may help explain the large-scale 
structure of clusters and super-clusters. In this scenario the collective streaming motion of 
galaxies is the residual velocity of the jet from which the cluster formed. The QSO peak at 
around z=2 and the varying intrinsic luminosity can presumable be modelled in a manner 
analogous to standard growth-supply equations.  

Other evidence has been presented for QSOs being at the redshift distance. One of the best 
examples is a study by Qin, Xie, Zheng and Liang to compare the emission and absorption lines 
of 400 quasars26. They found that all quasars had one or more absorption lines with a lesser 
redshift. This is interpreted as absorption by intervening galaxies or gas clouds and is strong 
evidence for QSOs being at the redshift distance. The analysis does not and cannot disprove the 
possibility of a fractional non-cosmological redshift in a small number of cases. As with all 
QSO surveys, the analysis turned up a surprise – 16% of the QSOs had absorption lines at a 
greater redshift then the emission line. The maximum z difference was 0.1450 and the mean 
was 0.0137. One of the few ways to account for this is to postulate that QSOs have a high 
proper velocity relative to the local neighbourhood, presumably as a result of the material 
ejection. The QSOs displaying this effect will be those moving towards the observer, the 
percentage being amplified by the selection effect. 

Following this line of reasoning, it should not be surprising to find QSOs associated with 

superluminal motion and proper motion. In the standard model, QSOs are not supposed to 
exhibit proper motion (and indeed this assumption forms the basis of an effective search 
technique), but if they are indeed associated with galactic ejection, limited proper motion might 
be expected in many QSOs, even accepting the huge distance. An analysis of 580 radio sources 
from 1980 to 200227 concluded that most exhibited proper motion, one as large as 0.4 mas/yr 
but typically about 0.05 mas/yr¶. At z=2, where the redshift is cosmological, 0.05 mas/yr 
corresponds to 2.6 light years per year. This is more than expected, but the paper does not make 
it clear how the QSO core is distinguished from ejected material (which is known to emit at 
radio frequencies and move superluminally) from which the radio energy may really originate.  

QSO output is known to vary significantly over periods as short as hours. If there is no 
evolution of variability, one would expect the time scale to show a (1+z) dependence. This is 
true even if part of the redshift is a result of the conservation mechanism described - the special 
relativistic dilation and (1+z)4 dimming are derived from the nett velocity. The finding of 
Hawkins28 that there appears to be no (1+z) dependence is at odds with the standard model and 
the conservation modification. A larger survey of 25,000 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey29 also failed to detect a (1+z) dependence. 

Gravitational lensing is a strong indicator that QSOs are at the redshift distance (e.g. QSO 

0959+561). In many cases, the intervening lensing galaxy or matter concentration has been 
detected.  

                                                 
¶ The observations in the reference are in the range z =  0 – 4.4. These observations will be subject to the 
angular width relation of Figure 4 and  with the assumption of a consistent proper motion could form 
another test of the cosmological models.  

- 14 - 

 
 
 
Redshift and Energy Conservation 

One other intriguing aspect of QSOs is the claim that the redshift is quantized. There are two 

schools of thought; the first believe that the redshift difference between galaxies and nearby, 
presumably ejected, QSOs is a multiple of 0.06. This seems to be discredited by an independent 
survey that searched for a Log(1+zdifference) periodicity in 1647 QSO-galaxy pairs identified in 
the 2dF quasar survey30 and found none. Bell proposes a much more complex scheme involving 
sums of series (but still based on the z value 0.062) and is supported by reasonable evidence31, 
32. 

If is incredible to think that quantization could be possible. The observed redshift may have 
a continuous cosmological component, a proper motion component (continuous because of the 
angle of orientation with respect to the observer) and possibly even a gravitational 
component33. Added to the mixture is the possibility of a luminosity redshift component. How 
can quantization possibly occur? Rather than reject the possibility out of hand, we can postulate 
that quantization is possible only if one of the elements is quantized and dominates all other 
factors. The cosmological and proper motion components cannot be quantized. It is difficult to 
accept that the gravitational redshift is significant because the core and host galaxy would have 
different redshifts so the last possibility is the luminosity redshift. Its value depends on BH 
dynamics, growth and accretion rates and possible preferred rates may occur, but the problem is 
that the luminosity redshift is not intrinsic but relative to the observer. For this reason, we must 
be dubious that it can offer an explanation for the claimed quantized redshift observations. 

A redshift – apparent magnitude plot of 64,866 QSOs, BLac objects and Active Galaxies 

taken from an online catalogue34 is shown in Figure 5. There is no obvious indication of 
quantization, but it does highlight the problem many of the dissenters have with the standard 
model of QSOs. From z = 0.4 to z = 3, the apparent magnitude and the dispersion is uniform. 
There is no hint of the diminishing brightness associated with Hubble’s law and obeyed 
reasonably well by galaxies and supernovae. Note that the diagram includes a (1+z)4 flux 
reduction hence the absolute magnitude increases dramatically with redshift. Presumably, the 
critics question the coincidence of the z-independent apparent magnitude but standard theory 
explains this by evolution and it is consistent with the notion of galaxies formed from ejecta – 
the volume of material is divided with each step of the cycle and hence the luminosity will 
decline. As such, we might find any luminosity redshift mixed in with many QSOs at the actual 
redshift distance with huge luminosity and simply add to the distribution but the factor is 
probably too small to significantly skew the distribution. 

Although there are many questions, the standard model is the best description of active 
nuclei currently available and is generally adequate. There are significant anomalies, and while 
they represent only a fraction of the complete evidence, an explanation is still required for each 
and in the most part this are not forthcoming. The introduction of a luminosity redshift helps to 
explain some of the anomalous data but by no means all. An analysis of the detailed properties 
of BHs and accretion during galaxy formation is required to make detailed quantitative 
predictions with which the idea can be properly tested. In conclusion, we will cite the case of 
galaxy NGC 7603 and its surroundings to show that the dissenters do have some fair 
ammunition against the standard model and the objections will not simply go away¶. 

Galaxy NGC 7603 (z = 0.029) was investigated by Sharp in 198635. An extended spiral arm 
ends on a smaller, higher surface brightness galaxy NGC 7603B with a redshift of 0.057. It was 
commented that the simplest explanation is of interaction, but because of the disparate redshifts 
this is clearly impossible. Sharp concluded that it is a chance projection effect. A more detailed 
investigation by López-Corredoira and Gutiérrez in 200436 showed two faint galaxies with z = 
0.245 and z = 0.394, one at each end of the narrow connecting filament.  The filament had a 
redshift consistent with that of the main galaxy over its entire length. The arrangement of the 

                                                 
¶ There are many examples give by Arp, E M Burbridge, G R Burbridge, Hickson and many others of 
apparently anomalous redshift associations between galasies or QSOs and galaxies. There is a considerable 
literature on the subject.

group is striking because of the agreement with the notion of galaxies forming at knots in jets, 
initially with a high redshift because of energy conservation.

catalogue of QSOs and active galaxies (11th Edition, 2003)34. All the 2dF and the first part of the SLOAN 
survey results are included. The plateau arises from the 21 magnitude sensitivity limitation of some of the 
surveys, and the weak striation is a rounding effect. 

7. Conclusion 

In this paper the issue of energy conservation associated with the normal Doppler shift of 

light was examined in some detail and was found to hold. The cosmological redshift was 
examined and it was shown that it could be treated as a Doppler effect arising from an 
equivalent velocity. Having established a working equivalence, an attempt was made to re-
establish energy conservation with the cosmological expansion by treating it like a Doppler 
effect with an additional recoil ‘cosmological velocity’. The new redshift may explain some 
reported anomalies in the redshift of QSOs.

The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) 

The CMBR can be given a Doppler interpretation in a way that is consistent with the 
observation that the transformed blackbody source remains a blackbody when viewed today. 
Referring to Figure 2, the cosmic background clearly cannot be treated as a point source as it 
surrounds the observer. The picture has to be reversed. Previously the source was at the centre 
and the observers were on the surface of the sphere. In this case, the observer is in the centre 
and the emitters are on the surface. When there is no relative velocity, the emitters appear on a 
continuous surface of a sphere of radius r. The moving observer is centred in a circle of radius 
(1+z)r,  assuming a special relativistic treatment of the recession velocity. The radiance or 
surface flux is the total energy emitted in unit time from unit surface area at the emission 
'surface' in the normal direction (units: Js-1m-2). For a black body, the radiance is found to be 
related to the surface temperature by Stefan’s Law:

as has been experimentally established. 

 
If the observer is assumed stationary with respect to the CMBR surface of last scattering, the 

measured radiance at a detector is the same as the surface radiance because the observer is 
bathed in the equilibrium photon gas. If the observer is moving at velocity v with respect to the 
scattering surface we can show that the blackbody spectrum of temperature T is transformed to 
another blackbody spectrum with a lower temperature T/ (1+z).  

The measured radiance will be reduced by (1+z)4 because of the reduction in photon energy 
and photon number and the reduced energy density at the emitting surface (the last scattering 
surface is projected onto a greater surface area hence the surface density of emitters is reduced, 
not exactly the same argument as for the point source). The measured energy density between

Anisotropic Doppler Source 

It is worth examining if it is possible to violate energy conservation by creating a source that 

is not isotropic. If, for example, a mirror is placed behind the source and accelerated with it 
(Figure B1): Is energy still conserved?

the source through the mirror will see the source moving away at velocity v, and thus with the 
same energy that an observer at B would measure.  Note that the photons will exert a force on 
the mirror through their momentum, but we will assume the mass is so great that no energy is 
transferred. If this mirror at position B (or any place between B and the source) is 
instantaneously accelerated to velocity v, an observer at, for example, position C will see the 
source moving towards then through the mirror. The photons that were emitted with a red shift 
should be measured to have a blue shift. The concept of the mirror ‘doing work’ on the photons 
is fraught with conceptual difficulties hence we will simply conduct a kinematic analysis 
(energy and momentum conservation). The analysis differs from the analysis of the source 
because the rest mass of the mirror is not altered – it can gain or lose momentum and kinetic 
energy – that’s it. Differentiating the energy equation for the mirror (equation (7)), we obtain

Consider that the incident photon of energy  Erest /g(1-bcosj) which hits the mirror and 
emerges with energy E’,  imparting the change of momentum dp on the mirror in the process. 
In the x direction, we can work out the final energy and the change in momentum

This is consistent. The mirror is slowed down supplying KE to increase the photon 

frequency. The emitter appears to be moving towards the observer at C when viewed through 
the mirror. With  j =p, the change of a red shift to a blue shift is consistent with this viewpoint. 
Specifically, the emitter appears to be moving away from the observer when viewed through 
the mirror. Note that the mass of the mirror is not relevant to the calculation. There is a tiny 
momentum transfer in the y direction because the incident and reflected photon energies are not 
the same, but the effect cancels over the whole apparatus. Looking again at Figure B1, if the 
mirror is part of the moving assembly, it is clear the now directed output beam will slow down 
the assembly ensuring energy conservation. There is approximately –2p of momentum 
associated with the mirror, +p associated with the escaping photon and +p from the recoil of the 
original emission which has been neglected from the calculation by presuming Erest 
incorporates any energy loss associated with the emission recoil. Note also the important 
kinematic difference between absorption and reflection. You may be concerned that the photon 
wavelength changes without being absorbed by the mirror but we can consider it to be 
associated with the path length and how it changes.  

This is all relevant to the idea of the ‘solar sail’, a propulsion concept to extract energy from 

solar photons. There has been some dispute as to whether the concept is feasible but it clearly 
is:  the mirror- emitter apparatus must recoil with a balancing momentum to that of the direct 
photons. Probably the source of confusion is when we consider the situation from rest frame of 
the source. The mirror is initially stationary with respect to the emitter therefore the photon 
reflected back must have the same frequency as that emitted (emitter looks stationary in the 
mirror hence no redshift). There is no energy transfer so how can the mirror ever begin to 
move? The energy transfer from a single ‘standard’ photon of energy Eg as a function of mirror 
velocity is

 Initially the mirror velocity is 0 hence no energy is transferred. The problem is related to 
Zeno’s paradox of motion and the resolution is to recognise that motion is not a continuous but

a discrete process. Substituting equation (B6) into equation (8) and noting that the change in

The efficiency of the mirrored solar sail doubles as the velocity approaches c. For the 

alternative of a solar sail made up of perfectly absorbing material the equivalent expression is

The change in internal energy is not 0 in this case hence an absorbing sail will heat up and 

radiate isotropically but with no effect on the nett velocity. If a reflector is placed in the 
forward direction of the absorbent surface, some of the radiation can be used to increase trust 
but the efficiency will only approach, not exceed, the performance of a perfect mirror as 
defined by equation (B7). Note that as the velocity approaches c, an absorber and a mirror 
become equally efficient.  

As a final thought on mirrors, consider an observer sending out photons to an orthogonal 
mirror moving radially at velocity v (the positive direction being towards the observer). The 
kinematic calculation following the lines of the ones above shows that the emitted and received 
wavelength are related by

Effectively the observer appears to himself to be moving at a velocity v plus v added 
relativistically : 2v /(1+v2/c2). Substituting this velocity into equation (1), with j = 0 gives 
equation (B9). Note that if the mirror is moving transversely, v is 0 and from equation (B1) the 
energy change at the mirror must be 0 – there is no redshift; because the photon path is not 
altered.

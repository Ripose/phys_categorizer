 The metal-halide arc lamp is an effective light source and its investigation has a 
long history, but even at present some authors are sure that the local thermodynamic 
equilibrium (LTE) model can be applied to such objects [1] whereas the others have 
proved  experimentally  that  such  plasma  is  non-equilibrium  object  [2-4].  However 
some  plasma  parameters  (electron  and  high  lying  excited  states  densities  as  well  as 
Hg  metastable  levels  densities)  are  assumed  to  be  in  equilibrium  with  electron 
temperature  and  these  assumptions  are  applied  in  plasma diagnostics. To verify this 
supposition  the  method  of  local  plasma  spectroscopy  based  on  spatial  and  temporal 
distribution of spectral line profiles was developed and described here.  

 
1. Experimental setup. 
 
The  experimental  setup  consists  of  a  high  aperture  scanning  diffraction 
spectrometer and special spatial scanning block. It allows to scan spectrum with step 
l =0.015 nm  in  the  range  of  300-800 nm,  to  scan  spatial  source  surface  radiance 
distribution  in  the  perpendicular  to  the  light  source  axis  direction  with  the  step 
d x=0.004 mm in the range of – 3cm. Light intensity is measured by a photomultiplier 
and amplifier with time resolution less than 10-3 s. For automation of the experiment 
the  setup  was  constructed  on  the  basis  of  CAMAC  crate.  The  crate  contains  two 
modules  for  stepper  motors  control,  modules  for  trailers  detection  and  two  analog-
digital  converters:  the  one  measures  light  intensity  and  the  other  measures  arc 
discharge  voltage.  It  allows  to  measure  the  intensity  in  chosen  phases  of  current 
period. The software for the experiment was developed in LabVIEW environment [5]. 
The software interacts with CAMAC by means of special program driver. In our case 
the  software  runs  on  the  IBM-compatible  computer  with  ОS  Windows 98.  The 
software  for  data  acquisition  consists  of  separate  modules,  that  are  implemented  as 
virtual instruments (VI). 

Before  experiment  starts  some  devices  need  calibration:  the  optical  system  is 
calibrated  on  wave  lengths  by  a  source  with  a  known  spectrum,  the  photodetector 
sensitivity  is  calibrated  by  the  registration  of  a  certificated  temperature  lamp 
spectrum,  and  the  linearity  of  ADC,  that  measures  light  intensity,  is  tested.  The 
experiment is controlled by the following VI: 

VI of spectrum scanning in the given spectral range with the given step. It was 
used  on  preliminary  stage  of  experiment  for  choosing  spectral  lines  for  further 
analysis and then for spectral device spread function measurement. As a light source 
for  this  purpose  the  spectral  cadmium  lamp  was  used.  Line  widths  in  this  lamp  are 
less  than  0.001 nm.  In  our  experimental  conditions  (spectral  slit  sizes  and  imaging 
system  parameters)  the  spread  function  has  width  equal  to  0.09 nm  and  in  further 
analysis this function is accepted to be gaussian of such width. 

VI  of  spatial gating at given wave length. This module is used for finding the 
spatial  point  corresponding 
the  discharge.  The  following 
the  center  of 
measurements are carried out for the center (x=0) and other points xk (k=1, 2...m-1), 
corresponding to m equidistant positions of spatial gating system.

VI  of  automated  spatially  and  spectral  scanning  in  the  given  spectral  and 
spatial intervals and time phase. ADC samples are averaged over a given number of 
measurements (usually - 100). The results are saved in a file for further analysis. 

VI of data loading for subsequent analysis (Fig. 1). 
First of all this module allows to load any data acquired by other modules and to 
derive various information from a spectrum (e.g. maximum positions and values, line 
widths) by LabVIEW tools for graphic processing (scaling and cursor positioning). It 
allows  also  to  join  some  arrays  corresponding  to  different  spectral  ranges  and 
different  time  moments  (but  spatial  points  must  be  the  same)  in  common  array  for 
joint  processing,  calculate  covariance  matrix  of  this  array,  find  its  eigenvalues  and 
eigenvectors (there is the standard LabVIEW module for this purpose "EigenValues 
& Vectors.vi"), and calculate the projections of each spectral point to all eigenvectors. 
It  is  the  essential  part  of  the  joint  processing  algorithm,  which  will  be  described  in 
details in the next section. 

This module is also used for calculation of the estimator S2 of the experimental 
random error by using data corresponding the same spectral, spatial and phase points 
acquired  in  several  recurring  experiments.  In  this  estimator  not  only  instrumental 
noises but also light source possible instability is taken into account.

2. Joint data processing algorithm. 
 
The  original  method  of  joint  data  processing  was  applied  to  data  arrays 
containing spatial, spectral and temporal distributions of source surface radiance. (The 
cylindrical  symmetry  of  the  source  was  supposed).  The  method  is  based  on  the 
principal  component  theory  [6].  The  method  takes  into  account  the  correlation 
between spectral emissivities inside spectral line profiles and allows to decrease the 
processing time as well as the noise influence on the results of instrumental distortion 
elimination and Abel inversion [7-9]. 

Let  us  denote  as  F(l

i,xk)  the  large  data  arrays  of  visible  spectral  intensities, 
measured along a series of chords, perpendicular to plasma axis (xk - the displacement 
of chord from the plasma centerline, l
i - the wavelength of spectral point inside the 
profile).  Instead  of  instrumental  distortion  elimination  from  each  profile  Fk(l ),  and 
i  we  can  spread  out  F(l
then  Abel  inversion  for  each  wave  length  l
i,xk)  on 
eigenvectors Up of covariance matrix of array F(l
i,xk), corresponding toeigenvalues p, 
superior the estimator S2 of the experimental random error. (As a rule, the number of 
such vectors q is much less than m - the number of position хk).

From these factors the instrumental distortion is to be excluded. The free from 
distortion factors are designated as Qpi. To eliminate instrumental distortion from Мi,p 
we applied the standard method of solving of the integral equation of convolution by 
Fourier transform [9].

Obviously, in this case the integral Abel equation may be transformed to system

The obtained spectral emissivities (3) are used for the determination of plasma 
parameters in the selected plasma point. (The spatial resolution of the imaging system 
was 0.02 cm at least). 

 
4. The experimental results and discussion. 
 
We investigated a mercury high pressure lamp with addition of thallium iodide 
which operates at input power of 250 W (50 Hz). The inner tube radius was 0.8 cm. 
The position of lamp was vertical. All results correspond to the central cross section. 

The  ground  state  Hg  atom  density  was  determined  by  the  width  of  mercury 
spectral lines 577 nm (63D2–61P1) and 579 nm (61D2–61P1). The broadening of these 
lines  is  the  resonance  one  [7].  So  there  are  no  shifts  in  profiles  corresponding  to 
different  spatial  points  and  different  time  moments.  There  is  also  no  dependence  of 
line width on spatial points and time moments. It is in accordance with our previous 
work [10], in which it was shown by analysis of plasma interference data that in such 
sources mercury atoms density is almost constant over the current period and over the 
most part of the arc, atoms density changes sharply only near the source wall, where

there is no radiation. Using this line width we estimated mercury atoms density in the 
ground state as NHg=(6.8– 0.2)(cid:215) 1018 cm-3. 

In accordance to the model from [4] we supposed that mercury atom densities in 
metastable states 63P2 and 63P0  are determined by electron temperature. These levels 
are  lower  for  spectral  lines  546.1 nm  and  404.6 nm,  which  are  broadened  by 
reabsorption. For such cases Abel inversion cannot be applied and we used simulation 
of  surface  radiance  spectral  profile  for  estimation  of  electron  temperature  radial 
distribution  [11].  The  transition  probabilities  were  obtained  from  NIST  Atomic 
Spectra  Database  [12],  estimation  of  the  Van-der-Waals  broadening  constant  was 
supposed  to  be  2.2(cid:215) 10-30 cm6/s  [13]  and  ground  state  densities  were  determined  by 
resonance  broadening.  The  best  accordance  between  the  measured  profiles  and  the 
calculated  ones  was  obtained  when  electron  temperature  (T)  radial  dependence  was 
supposed as 
 

T(r)=T0-(T0-Tw)(r/L)3,

where Tw=1000 K is the temperature on the tube wall, L is the wall radius,  T0 - 
is the temperature in the discharge center. T0=(5300– 100)K at the time moment when 
the discharge current and light emission are maximal and T0=(4100– 100)K when they 
are minimal (Fig.2).

Then we have determined electron density by spectral line shifts. 
Thallium  line  552.8 nm  (92P3/2–72S1/2)  and  654.9 nm  (82P3/2–72S1/2)  are 
broadened  mainly  by  the  Stark-effect,  it  leads  to  appreciable  shifts  of  profiles  in 
different spatial points and different current phases (Fig.3).

We  supposed  that    the  experimental  shift  of  profile  maximum  D

  is  caused  by 
Stark-effect  and  we  estimated  the  electron  densities  in  the  arc  cross  section  by 
formula [13, 14]:

results are averaged by two lines and three independent experiments.  

In  the  same  figure  one  can  see  the  electron  density,  determined  from  Saha

experimental errors for the moment, when discharge current has maximal value, the 
Saha balance between electron and high lying excited states densities takes place for 
core part of discharge tube. 

 

 

Fig.4. Radial dependence of electron density determined by spectral line shifts 

(black circles) and Saha equation (red rectangles). 

 
For  minimal  current  phase  there  is  no  noticeable  spectral  line  shift  except  the 
point  r=0  for  line  552.8 nm (D ~0.015 nm, it corresponds ne=4.8(cid:215) 10-14 cm-3), whereas 
Saha equation gives for this point ne=(9.2– 1.2)(cid:215) 10-14 cm-3, so we cannot say that Saha 
balance  between  electron  and  high  lying  excited  states  densities  takes  place  in 
minimal current phase. 

 
If  we  explained  the  width  of  these  lines  only  to  Stark-broadening  we  would 
receive  the  electron  density  for  r=0  almost  three  times  more  than  by  shift,  with 
increasing  of  r  from  r=0  to  r=0.24 cm  the  line  width  decreases  and  then  begins  to 
increase  to  the  limit  of  discharge.  This  effect  is  noticeable  for  both  current  phases. 
Now we cannot explain this broadening by Van-der-Waals interaction with Hg atoms 
nor by reabsortion effect (these effects gives less than 10% from the full line width). 
Perhaps, the effect may be explained by Tl-J interaction, this problem is an object of 
further investigations.

The  above  paper  concerns  the  boundary  layer  flow  of  a  visco-elastic 
fluid  along  a  stretching  sheet  immersed  in  a  porous  medium.  The  plate 
temperature  is  different  from  that  of  the  ambient  medium    and  the  fluid 
viscosity  is a function  of temperature  while the other fluid  properties  are 
assumed  to  be  constant.    The  boundary  layer  equations  are  transformed 
into ordinary ones and subsequently are solved using the shooting  method
  However,  there  are  two

fundamental errors  in this paper which are presented below:

1. In the  transformed energy equation (2.8) the Prandtl number appears 
in three  terms  and  has  been  assumed  constant  across the boundary 
layer.  However,  the  Prandtl  number  is  a  function  of  viscosity  and 
viscosity  has been assumed a  function of temperature whereas the 
other  fluid  properties  are  considered  constant  and  independent  of 
temperature.  Taking  into  account  that  temperature  varies  across  the 
boundary layer,  the Prandtl  number  varies, too.   The assumption of 
constant Prandtl number inside the boundary layer, with temperature 
dependent viscosity,  is a wrong assumption and leads to unrealistic 
In  these  three    paper  by 
results  (Pantokratoras,  2004, 2005,  2007).
Pantokratoras  the difference in  the results between variable Prandtl 
number  (correct  assumption)  and  constant  Prandtl  number  (wrong 
assumption) reached 435 % , 85 %.and 98 %.  The problem can be 
treated properly either  considering the Prandtl number as a variable 
in  the  transformed  equations  (Saikrishnan  and  Roy,  2003)    or  with 
the direct solution of the initial boundary layer equations and treating 

the viscosity  as  a  function  of  temperature  (Pantokratoras,  2004, 
2005, 2007).

2. The  viscous  dissipation  term  in  the  energy  equation  has  been 

modelled as

where  μ  is  the  fluid  viscosity  and  u  is  the  fluid  velocity  along  the 
plate.  However,    in  porous  media  the  modelling  of  viscous 
dissipation  is  completely  different  from  that  in  pure  fluid  flow 
(without  porous  medium).      Nield  (2000)  proposed  the  following 
equation for modelling the viscous dissipation  in a porous medium

The problem is still open in the literature but one thing is sure. The 
viscous dissipation term in porous  media is expressed by two terms 
and not one as happed in the above paper.

Taking  into  account  the  above  arguments  there  are  doubts  for  the 
credibility of the above  work.

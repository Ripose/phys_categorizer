We  demonstrate  low-threshold  random  lasing  in  random  amplifying  layered  medium  via  photon 
localization.  Lasing  is  facilitated  by  resonant  excitation  of  localized  modes  at  the  pump  laser 
wavelength,  which  are  peaked  deep  within  the  sample  with  greatly  enhanced  intensity.  Emission 
occurs  into  long-lived  localized  modes  overlapping  the  localized  gain  region.  This  mechanism 
overcomes  a  fundamental  barrier  to  reducing  lasing  thresholds  in  diffusive  random  lasers,  in  which 
multiple scattering restricts the excitation region to the proximity of the sample surface. 

 

In  conventional  lasers,  emission  is  stimulated  into 
well-defined  cavity  modes  and  emerges  as  a  coherent 
beam.  Care  is  taken  to  suppress  scattering  within  the 
cavity  since  this  would  shorten  the  photon  residence 
time in the lasing mode and thereby raise the excitation 
power required to initiate lasing. In the opposite limit of 
a  random  amplifying  medium,  however,  multiple 
scattering  impedes  the  flow  of  light  out  of  the  gain 
region [1,2]. This has led to a search for lasing action in 
random amplifying media, which was observed in rare 
earth  [3]  and  semiconductor  [4]  powders,  colloidal 
suspensions  in  dye  solutions  [5,6],  and  organic  films 
[7].  However,  the  lasing  threshold  in  these  diffusive 
systems  is  not  appreciably  lowered  below  that  for 
amplified spontaneous emission in homogeneous media 
because multiple scattering also impedes the flow of the 
incident pump light into the sample [8]. This creates a 
shallow  gain  region  and  allows  subsequently  emitted 
photons to escape promptly as diffuse luminescence.  

In this Letter, we show that a collimated laser beam is 
produced at greatly reduced lasing threshold in a stack 
of microscope cover slides with interspersed dye films. 
The  threshold  is  sufficiently  low  for  lasing  to  be 
induced with a quasi-cw illumination by a 3-Watt laser 
beam  from  an  Argon-ion  laser.  Pump  energy  is 
deposited  deep  within  the  sample,  where  it  is  greatly 
enhanced,  by  the  resonant  excitation  of  spectrally 
narrow  localized  modes.  Subsequent  emission  occurs 
into long-lived localized modes which spatially overlap 
the region of molecular excitation. This is demonstrated 
by  the  strong  correlation  of  pump  transmission  and 
output laser power.  

The  sample  is  a  stack  of  L  partially  reflecting  glass 
slides  of  random  thickness  of  ~100  µm  with  an 
amplifying region or an air gap between the slides. The 
amplifying  layers  consisted  either  of  25-µm  thick 
solution of Rhodamine 6G laser dye in ethylene glycol, 
or of a single 0.3-mm-thick chromophore-doped plastic 
sheet. The stack was illuminated at normal incidence by

Light  in  this  one-dimensional  (1D)  geometry  is 
localized by multiple scattering from the parallel layers 
which  returns  the  wave  upon  itself  [9-12].  Emission 
spectra, 
0.07-nm-resolution 
spectrometer, are shown in Fig. 1. The broad emission 
spectrum of neat dye solution (dashed curve in Fig. 1a) 
is  compared  with  the  emission  spectrum  from  the 
random  stack  with  interspersed  dye  layers  slightly 
below and above the lasing threshold. Below threshold, 
the  spectrum  shows  resolution-limited  peaks  of  the 
electro-magnetic  modes  of  the  system  (lower  curve  in 
Fig. 1a). Above threshold, a collimated emission beam 
perpendicular  to  the  sample  layers  was  observed 
(middle  curve  in  Fig.  1a).  The  abrupt  change  in  the 
output  power  with  increasing  pump  energy  shown  in 
the  inset  to  Fig.  1c  is  characteristic  of  the  lasing 
transition.  At  low  pump  energies,  lasing  occurred  in  a 
single  narrow  line  (Figs.  1a  and  1b)  while  at  higher 
energies, multimode lasing was observed (Fig. 1c) with 
wavelength  and  intensity  that  vary  randomly  with  the 
position of the pump beam on the sample surface. The 
lasing  threshold  depended  strongly  upon  the  dye 
concentration,  sample  thickness,  and  location  of  gain 
inside the stack. The lowest threshold of ~ 0.25 µJ was 
measured  with  a  single  dye  layer  with  a  concentration 
of 4 mg of dye in 1 ml of ethylene glycol at the center 
of  a  stack  of  60  glass  slides.  This  pump  energy  is 
equivalent  to  a  continuous  pump  intensity  of  ~  10 
kW/cm2,  which  can  be  obtained  from  a  standard 
continuous-wave 
laser  source.  Indeed,  single  and 
multimode lasing was observed using the output of a 6-
Watt  Argon-ion  laser  which  was  chopped  in  order  not 
to overheat the sample (dashed curve in Fig. 1 b). 

The  distinct  spontaneous  emission  and  lasing  peaks, 
shown  in  Fig.1,  contrast  with  the  continuous  emission 
spectrum  of  the  diffusive  random  laser  [5]  and  is 
characteristic  of  localized  electromagnetic  modes.  In 
localized  media,  the  spectral  width  of  a  mode,  δν,

FIG.  1.  Emission  spectra  of  the  neat  dye  solution  (dashed
curve  in  (a))  and  of  localization  laser  for  the  following
experimental parameters: (a) – single 25-µm dye layer (2 mg 
of dye in 1 ml of ethylene glycol) in the middle of a stack of
50 glass slides; pump energy, Epump, was 110 µJ and 130 µJ 
per  pulse  for  the  lower  and  middle  curves  (shifted  up  for
clarity), respectively. (b,c) - sample of 100 layers, in which 
every  other  air  gap  was  filled  with  the  same  dye  solution;
Epump  =  3.2  µJ  and  4.9  µJ  per  pulse  for  (b)  and  (c),
respectively. The inset in (c) shows the total emission energy
integrated  over  the  spectral  region  550-590  nm.  Dashed 
curve in (b) shows the emission spectrum (shifted by 15 nm)
obtained with a single colored plastic sheet in the center of a
stack of 50 glass slides, which was pumped with a chopped
3-Watt cw beam from an Argon ion laser. 

which is the inverse of the escape time of photons from 
the medium, is smaller than the typical spacing between 
modes, ∆ν, giving a value for the Thouless number, δ, 
below  unity,  δ  ≡  δν/∆ν  <  1  [10,12,13].  Narrow 
emission  modes  have  also  been  observed  recently  in 
micron-sized  diffusive  ZnO  clusters  [14]  and  organic 
thin  films  [7].  Although  δ  >  1  in  these  samples,  its 
value  approaches  unity  when  the  photon  excursion 
volume  approaches  the  coherence  volume  Vc  =  (λ/2)3. 
In the presence of substantial gain, emission into a few 
is 
long-lived  modes  of 
enhanced, giving rise to distinct spectral peaks [15]. In 
contrast,  the  overlap  of  many  modes  in  macroscopic 
diffusive  lasers  results  in  non-resonant  feedback  and  a 
continuous emission spectrum [2]. Because of the large 
number  of  competing  modes  within  the  excitation 
volume,  the  number  of  stimulated  photons  in  each 
mode  is  low.  As  a  result,  the  lasing  threshold  is  high 
and only a modest spectral narrowing is achieved.  

the  microscopic  sample 

The small value of δ in random layered media reflects 
weak coupling between adjacent regions of a localized 
sample since modes in different regions of a sample do 
not  spectrally  overlap.  This  results  in  the  exponential 
falloff  of  the  average  transmittance,  〈T〉,  with  sample 
thickness  [9,10].  Excellent  agreement  is  found  in  a 
comparison of the measured average transmittance over 
a  10mm2  area  of  the  sample  and  scattering  matrix 
simulations  [16]  for  random  ensembles  of  1D  samples 
for  L  ≤  60  slides,  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  measured 
transmittance

longitudinal disorder as a result of the random speckle 
pattern  in  the  transmitted  field  due  to  the  transverse 
inhomogeneity  of  the  glass  slides  of  ~  200nm/mm.  A 
single exponential fit to the measured transmittance, 〈T〉 
~  exp(-L/2ξ),  for  L  >  25  slides  gave  the  localization

provides 
in  which 
transmission can be high [10,12,17]. A large number of 
narrow modes was observed in measurements (Fig. 3a) 
and  in  scattering  matrix  calculations  (Fig.  3b)  of 
transmittance for random stacks of 50 glass slides. The 
laser  beam  was  focused  to  an  80-µm-diameter  spot. 
Stronger  focusing  was  avoided  in  order  to  prevent 
spectral line broadening due to the angular spread of the 
incident  beam.  High  spectral  resolution  was  obtained 
using a single-mode tunable dye laser with a linewidth 
of  ~  1  MHz  (∆λ≈10-6  nm).  In  the  spectrum  shown  in 
Fig.  3a,  the  laser  was  scanned  in  0.01-nm  steps. 
Measurements of the width of a typical narrow isolated 
transmission line using scans with step size of 10-4 nm 
gave  δλ  =  4.3×10-3  nm.  Narrow  transmittance  lines,

FIG.  3.  (Color  online)  (a)  High-resolution  experimental  spectrum  of  transmission  through  a  stack  of  50  glass  slides.  (b) 
Results  of  a  scattering-matrix  calculation  of  the  transmittance  spectrum  for  a  stack  of  50  slabs  of  random  thickness

which  correspond  to  long-lived  spatially  localized 
modes  [12,18],  occur  at  both  the  excitation  and 
emission wavelengths. The highest transmittance found 
in  simulations  is  of  order  unity  and  occurs  at  the 
wavelength corresponding to the peaks of the narrowest 
lines  at  which  the  intensity  is  exponentially  enhanced 
near  the  center  of  the  layered  medium,  as  shown  in 
Figs.  3b  and  3c.  The  spatial  distribution  of  the  pump 
energy  at  wavelength  λ1  inside  the  layered  structure 
demonstrates  the  deep  penetration  of  the  pump  energy 
into the sample’s interior when the pump laser is tuned 
to  resonance  with  a  localized  mode.  Energy  absorbed 
from this mode is subsequently emitted into long-lived 
localized  modes  which  fall  within  the  dye  emission 
spectrum, e.g. at wavelength λ2. Stimulated emission is 
enhanced  when  the  spatial  energy  distributions  at  both 
the  excitation  and  emission  wavelengths  overlap.  In 
contrast to the resonant modes at λ1 and λ2, the energy 
falls 
of  nonresonant 
exponentially  within  the  sample.  The  deposition  of 
pump  energy  deep  within  the  sample  and  its  efficient 
coupling to long-lived emission modes removes a major 
barrier 
the 
presence  of  disorder.  Serendipitously,  the  increased 
penetration of the excitation light entails an exponential 
increase  in  the  pump  intensity  near  the  center  of  the 
sample. This produces population inversion even at low 
incident power.

light 

in 

Since  lasing  occurs  via  the  excitation  of  narrow 
localized modes, large fluctuations in the output lasing 
power may be expected as different parts of the sample 

are  excited  [18].  This  is  seen  in  the  plot  of  the  total 
energy emitted into a solid angle of 0.2 steradian versus 
the transverse position of the pump beam on the sample 
surface in Fig. 4. Different realizations of disorder were 
sampled  as  different  parts  of  the  stack  were  excited 
with 10 µJ pulses while the sample was translated in the 
plane  of  the  glass  slides.  The  total  laser  power  was 
integrated  over  the  wavelength  range  of  555-590  nm. 
The  simultaneously  measured  pump 
transmission 
(dashed  curve)  is  strongly  correlated  with  the  output 
laser  power.  This  is  contrary  to  the  expectation  for  a 
diffusive  amplifying  medium  that  strong  transmission 
would  be  the  result  of  weak  absorption  of  the  pump 
laser,  and  thus  would  be  associated  with  low  output 
laser power. In the present case, strong transmission is 
expected  when  the  pump  laser  is  at  resonance  with 
localized  modes  which  are  spatially  peaked  near  the 
center  of  the  sample.  Pump  intensity  is  therefore 
exponentially  enhanced  within  the  sample  (Fig.  3), 
which  results  in  efficient  energy  transfer  to  the  gain 
medium.  Further,  since  excitation  in  the  center  of  the 
sample  is  likely  to  escape  via  emission  into  the 
localized  modes  with  long  photon  residence  time,  the 
opportunity for stimulated emission is enhanced and the 
laser  output  power  is  high.  Since  both  strong  pump 
transmission and high output laser power are associated 
with  the  excitation  of  localized  modes  in  the  center  of 
the sample, these quantities are strongly correlated. 

The crossover from nonresonant to resonant feedback 
in  random  lasers  as  the  parameter  δ  falls  below  unity 
parallels  the  transition  between  wave  diffusion  and

simple  design,  which  can  be  literally  slapped  together. 
A collimated beam emerges normal to the surface since 
lasing  is  initiated  only  in  the  longest-lived  modes, 
which spatially overlap the gain region. Low-threshold, 
narrow-line lasing was observed in samples in which L 
is  not  much  larger  than  ξ.  Since  the  mode  lifetime  is 
expected  to  grow  exponentially  with  the  number  of 
layers  in  a  1D  sample,  greatly  improved  performance 
may  be  anticipated  in  samples  with  larger  ratio  L/ξ, 
which  may  be  produced,  for  example,  in  binary  thin 
films.  When  the  transverse  spread  of  a  wave  becomes 
comparable  to  the  transverse  coherence  length  set  by 
inhomogeneity  in  the  plane  [16],  the  sample  can  no 
longer  be  regarded  as  one-dimensional  and  the  role  of 
transverse disorder must be considered.

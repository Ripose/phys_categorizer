Abstract

The normality dependence and the kinetics of ﬂow behavior in the rice starch disper-
sion under strong alkali conditions were studied. Non-Newtonian ﬂow (power-law)
quantities n and µ (σ = µ( ˙(cid:15))n; σ: shear stress, ˙(cid:15): shear rate) of the samples stored
(gelatinized) at 20◦C for 10min after the addition of NaOH solution with the nor-
mality 0.090 - 0.175N, were measured by a cone-plate type rotational viscometer.
For the ﬂow analysis a care was taken for the ambiguity of the analysis range of
ﬂow data. The samples added with 0.14 - 0.16N NaOH displayed an apparently
dilatant ﬂow. As the normality of added NaOH increased, apparent viscosity ηa was
steeply enhanced in the vicinity of 0.14N and started to grow almost exponentially.
Next, the storage time dependence of ﬂow properties was investigated for samples
gelatinized for 6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 230 after the addition of 0.146N NaOH solution. A
Newtonian analysis of the ﬂow (σ - ˙(cid:15)) data indicated that viscosity η increased
exponentially in the early stage (6 ≤ t ≤ 35) and did linearly in the middle. It
was argued that the observed time dependence of viscosity could be described by
a ﬁrst-order reaction hypothesis combined with the ﬂuidity (η−1) mixing rule with
respect to ungelatinized and gelatinized fractions of starch. The application of this
theoretical treatment to the present data suggested that the gelatinization process
was composed of plural phases with diﬀerent values of a rate constant. For the ob-
served kinetic characteristic of alkali gelatinization, the discussions were presented
on the basis of amylose complex formation.

Introduction

Starch gelatinization phenomena in a hot aquoes medium have long been
one of principal subjects in food sciences from both applied and fundamen-
tal points of view. Although physicochemical fundamentals are still not fully
understood, the inﬂuence of various factors, such as time, temperature and
components (moisture, salts, sugar, lipids · · ·) on this phenomenon has been
vigorously investigated. In recent years, the kinetic studies using diﬀerential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) have become popular (Wirakartakusumah, 1981;
Lund, 1984; Lund & Wirakartakusumah, 1984; Slade & Levine, 1991; Zanoni,
Schiraldi, & Simonetta, 1995; Yeh & Li, 1996; Ojeda, Tolaba, & Su´arez, 2000).
The kinetic treatment is important in the study of starch gelatinization be-
cause the system during gelatinization is in a nonequilibrium state and the
knowledges obtained from the kinetic studies could serve to clarify the reaction
mechanism in molecular levels.

However, few attempts have so far been made to construct the starch gela-
tinization kinetics from the rheological viewpoint such as those based on ﬂow
properties of starch dispersions. This would partly be due to technical dif-
ﬁculties in carrying out rheological measurements with sample temperatures
kept high and constant (65 - 90◦C). In order to develop the simple kinetics of
starch gelatinization, one must deﬁne a degree of gelatinization and follow its
change as a function of time keeping all other environmental variables con-
stant. In the DSC approach, a degree of gelatinization is directly measured
from an enthalpy of gelatinization. On the other hand, in the rheological ap-
proach, one must deﬁne a well-deﬁned physical (measureable) quantity which
is related to a degree of gelatinization, and must measure its time dependence
under isothermal conditions. The choice of an adequate physical quantity and
its relation with a degree of gelatinization are not trivial.

Kubota, Hosokawa, Suzuki, and Hosaka (1979) studied the time dependence
of ﬂuid consistency index for the gelatinization of rice and potato starches
using capillary viscometry. After gelatinizing the starch paste for a ﬁxed time
under isothermal conditions, they cooled it immediately to stop gelatinization
and evacuated the gas. They then prepared the 3wt% starch dispersion and
measured the ﬂow behavior at 30◦C. By assuming a ﬁrst-order reaction model
and deﬁning the degree of gelatinization as a ratio of the ﬂuid consistency
index, they calculated the reaction rate constant.

In the present work, we focused on the ﬂow properties of the starch dispersion
gelatinized by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Under strong alkali con-
ditions starch is known to gelatinize even at room temperatures. Among the
applications of this phenomenon is to utilize it for producing an adhesive paste.
From an academic interest, this peculiarity of the alkali gelatinization could

2

give us a technical advantage for the rheological measurement in isothermal
conditions. Compared with thermal starch gelatinization, however, much less
is known about alkali gelatinization (Suzuki & Juliano, 1975; Oosten, 1982,
1983, 1990; Otsuka, Moritaka, Fukuba, Kimura, & Ishihara , 2001; Moritaka,
Ishihara, Matsumoto, Iino, & Kimura, 2003), and especially no kinetic ap-
proach has appeared.

Here we studied the ﬂow properties of the dispersion of rice starch which is one
of well-known seed-originated starches. Although some diﬀerences are present
in some technical aspects of experimental and theoretical treatments, it would
be interesting to compare a part of the present results with those of Kubota et
al. (1979). Using a cone-plate type rotational viscometer, we ﬁrst investigated
the ﬂow properties of the samples with a ﬁxed storage (i.e. gelatinization) time
after the addition of NaOH solution and their dependences on a normality of
added NaOH. The results were analyzed by power-law model to elucidate the
normality dependence of a ﬂow behavior index and a consistency coeﬃcient as
well as an apparent viscosity. Especially we found that the samples prepared
by NaOH with normalities in the vicinity of 0.15N exhibited nearly Newtonian
ﬂows.

Next, for the samples added with the NaOH solution of this ﬁxed normality,
for which the Newtonian approximation is expected to ﬁt well in some time
region, we studied the storage time dependence of their ﬂow properties by
using both power-law and Newtonian models. If the Newtonian model can be
a good approximation model, we can deﬁne the normal viscosity as well as the
apparent viscosity, as functions of time. These would enable us to consider
the kinetics of starch gelatinization from the rheological viewpoint. For the
obtained time dependence of viscosity, we found a novel concavity property
of the viscostiy - time curve in the early stage of gelatinization. This kinetic
characteristic of alkali gelatinization is qualitatively diﬀerent from that known
for thermal gelatinization. Inspired by that, we proposed a new type of the
mixing rule of viscosity (ﬂuidity) with respect to ungelatinized and gelatinized
fractions of starch. It was argued that this choice of mixng rule could describe
the time dependence of viscosity observed for the present alkali gelatinization
of rice starch.

Experimental

Sample preparation

In this study the commercial powdered sample of nonglutinous rice starches
“Better Friend”, obtained from Shimada Chemical Co. (Japan), was used with-

3

out any puriﬁcation. The composition of the starch powder taken from supplier
information is shown in Table 1.

The experimental samples for the study of the normality dependence were pre-
pared in the following way. The weighed NaOH solutions (95.56g) at diﬀerent
levels of normality (0.090 - 0.175N) and the rice starch powder (4.44g) weighed
into 100-m` beakers, were stored at 20◦C before mixing. At the equilibrium,
the NaOH solution was added to the starch, at which the time measurement
of the gelatinization period was to start (t = 0). The NaOH-starch mixture
in the beaker was immediately stirred with a glass rod of 7-mm diameter by
suﬃcient times to obtain a homogenious dispersion (actually 100 times). After
stirring the beaker was stored in the incubator controlled at 20◦C untill the
ﬂow measurement. For each normality, three samples were prepared in most
cases.

The samples for studying the time dependence of viscosity were prepared in a
similar manner as above except for the followings. The 0.146N NaOH solutions
(20◦C, 860.04g in all), divided into 4 portions, were added successively to the
starch (20◦C, 39.96g) weighed into a 1-` beaker. The storage (gelatinization)
time measuremnt was to start (t = 0) at which the NaOH solution was ﬁrst
added to the starch. Under the mixing, the mixture was stirred totally 900
times to avoid inhomogeneity. From this starch dispersion (900g), 8 portions
of each 100g were poured into eight 100-m` beakers. They were wrapped by
polymethylpentene ﬁlms to prevent drying and were stored in the incubator
(20◦C) until the ﬂow measurement so that the total storage (gelatinization)
time t[min] ranged from 6 to 230. 90sec before the ﬂow measurement, each
sample was stirred again 10 times by the glass rod.

The concentration of the starch powder in all samples thus prepared became
4.44wt%, and hence the substantial starch concentration was 3.8wt% if one
considered only the carbonhydrate content of the starch (Table 1 supplied by
the manufacturer).

Flow measurement

The ﬂow measurement was made using a controlled stress rheometer CSL2
500 (TA Instruments) equipped with a cone (4cm diameter, 2◦ angle) and
plate geometry. The cone-plate geometry provides uniform shear and is suited
for studying a non-Newtonian ﬂuid as well as a Newtonian one. The starch
samples were poured onto the bottom plate controlled to be at 20◦C with a
Peltier system. Shear stress σ[Pa] was controlled to increase linearly from 0.0
to 2.0 in 2.0min. The time t[min] at which the ﬂow measurement was made,
i.e. the time at the end of the storage (gelatinization) period, was deﬁned

4

by just the middle time of measurement, in other words, 1.0min after the
measurement had started. All the ﬂow data of the present starch samples
were collected and converted to the shear stress σ[Pa] - shear rate ˙(cid:15)[s−1] data
by Rheology Solutions Software (TA Instruments, ver. 1.1.6).

Flow analysis

σ = µ( ˙(cid:15))n

For studying the normality dependence, the samples were treated as non-
Newtonian ﬂuids and the converted ﬂow data were analyzed by the power-law
model

where µ[Pa·sn] and n (dimensionless) denote respectively consisitency coeﬃ-
cient and ﬂow behavior index. The ﬂows are characterized in terms of these
quantities as well as an apparent viscosity ηa deﬁned later.

As the result of power-law analysis we found that the samples prepared by
NaOH in the vicinity of 0.15N showed nearly Newtonian ﬂows (n ≈ 1). We
then performed measurements for the samples prepared by 0.146N NaOH to
study the time dependence of ﬂow properties to which the power-law analysis
(1) was ﬁrstly applied. Next, we ﬁxed ﬂow behavior index n to be 1, as a
working hypothesis (an approximation). Namely, we analyzed the ﬂow data
by a Newtonian model

σ = η ˙(cid:15)

with η[Pa·s] the viscosity of sample. The validity of this approximation should
be checked statistically (in the sense of linear regression) and we shall actually
ﬁnd that this Newtonian approximation is fairy good (R2 > 0.90) at least in
the early stage of gelatinization. The viscosity η deﬁned by this Newtonian
model and an apparent viscosity ηa will be used for the kinetic arguments.

Let us explain our analysis procedures explicitly. For the Newtonian approxi-
mation, a linear regression analysis (y = ax + b) was applied to the obtained
σ - ˙(cid:15) data with b ﬁxed to be zero. Viscosity η was obtained as the coeﬃcient
a. The power-law approximation model (1) is rewritten by

log σ = log µ + n log ˙(cid:15)

(1)

(2)

(3)

The σ - ˙(cid:15) data of each sample was hence converted to the log σ - log ˙(cid:15) data
to which a linear regression analysis was applied. From the results of the

5

linear regression analysis then followed the values of ﬂow behavior index n
and consisitency coeﬃcient µ. Although this procedure is not a complete non-
linear regression analysis for the power-law approximation (1), we used this
simple method as a working hypothesis in the present work. All this is the
basic description of our ﬂow analysis.

Supplements for ﬂow analysis methods

As regards the details of ﬂow analysis procedures, we need to give some tech-
nical supplements. With both use of ﬂow analysis models (2) and (1), the
results thus obtained should more or less depend on the choice of the analysis
range of the ﬂow data, i.e. the range of data points to which a regression anal-
ysis is applied. For example, the Newtonian approximation (2) is generally
valid in a relatively smaller shear stress region. A deviation from the Newto-
nian law brought by the structure change of sample particles could occur in a
large shear stress region. The result of the regression analysis would therefore
strongly depend on the upper limit of the analysis (stress) range.

On the other hand, the power-law model usually continues to be an adequate
analysis model to approximate the real ﬂow curves of starch samples even
under large shear stresses. A decrease of the apparent viscosity due to a large
shear stress is reasonably reﬂected by a pseudo-plastic ﬂow property (n < 1) of
the power-law model. Rather, a linear regression performed for the converted
data (log σ - log ˙(cid:15)) would be quite sensitive to unavoidable experimental ﬂuc-
tuations in a small shear stress region, and hence to the lower limit of the
analysis range. It is simply because the logarithmic quantities log σ and log ˙(cid:15)
vary rapidly against the slight changes of σ(≈ 0) and ˙(cid:15)(≈ 0) respectively.

To study the normality dependence, we made all the measurements at t[min] =
10. For the ﬂow analysis, considering the ambiguity as for the analysis range
pointed above, we used the power-law model (1) with the following two kinds
of analysis methods (procedures). One analysis method is to analyze the con-
verted data (log σ - log ˙(cid:15)) in the whole range of measurement corresponding
to the shear stress range 0 < σ[Pa] < 2.0 (the power-law analysis method
I). By use of this method all informations included in the measurement were
taken into account. The other analysis method is to analyze the converted
data points within a variable log σ - log ˙(cid:15) range corresponding to the shear
stress range y < σ[Pa] < 2.0, and to seek for the lower limit y∗[Pa] which
could provide the highest regression R2; the power-law model ﬁts best in the
range y∗ < σ[Pa] < 2.0 (the power-law analysis method II).

Based on the above measurement and the power-law analysis, we found that
the samples prepared by NaOH with the normalities in the vicinity of 0.15N

6

exhibited nearly Newtonian (n ≈ 1) ﬂows at t[min] = 10. Then, for the samples
prepared with the 0.146N NaOH and stored (gelatinized) from t[min] = 6 to
230, we carried out ﬂow measurements to see the storage (gelatinization) time
dependence of their ﬂow properties. To the obtained data we ﬁrst perfomed
the power-law analysis (1) with the above methods I and II, and investigated
the time dependence of ﬂow quantities n and µ.

After checking that the value of ﬂow behavior index varies below and above
n = 1 in some time region we next analyzed the ﬂow data by taking n to
be a constant (= 1), i.e. by applying a Newtonian approximation (2) with
the following two analysis methods (procedures). One method is to analyze
the data points (σ - ˙(cid:15)) in the whole range of measurement 0 < σ[Pa] < 2.0
(the Newtonian analysis method I). The other is to analyze the data points
within a variable shear stress range 0 < σ[Pa] < y and to search for the upper
limit y∗[Pa] giving the highest validity R2; the Newtonian model ﬁts best in
the range 0 < σ[Pa] < y∗ (the Newtonian analysis method II). The validity of
these Newtonian analyses should anyhow be checked by the R2 values of linear
regression analyses. We will actually see that the Newtonian approximation
is fairy good (R2 > 0.90) even for the method I at least in the early stage
(t[min] < 40) of gelatinization where a novel kinetic property shall be found.

Now the ﬁnal comment in this section is in order on the deﬁnition of apparent
viscosity ηa which shall appear in the following sections. The apparent viscosity
in the present article means the ratio σ/ ˙(cid:15) deﬁned at the shear rate - shear stress
data point ( ˙(cid:15), σ) corresponding to the middle value (σ[Pa] = 1.0) of a whole
shear stress range (0 - 2.0[Pa]). This data point was obtained at the middle
time of each measurement, which was consistently the time t[min] deﬁned as
the end point of a storage (gelatinization) time of the starch sample.

Results

Normality dependence

In Fig. 1 are exhibited the results of the normality (0.090 - 0.175N) dependence
of ﬂow behavior index n and of consistency coeﬃcient µ respectively. They
were obtained by the measurement at t[min] = 10 after the addition of NaOH.
For each quantity, solid square (cid:4) and open square (cid:3) represent the data points
derived by the power-law analysis methods I (whole stress region) and II
(maximum R2) respectively. In a normality region lower than 0.160N, the
ﬂow behavior index n for the analysis method II showed higher values than
those for the analysis method I.

7

The R2 values for both analysis methods (Fig. 2) were considerably high (≥
0.9) except for a very high normality (≥ 0.165N) region. For the power-law
analysis method II, a ratio of the lower limit y∗[Pa] to the ﬁnal value (2.0[Pa])
of the analysis range and its normality dependence are also displayed in Fig. 2.
In a low normality (≤ 0.14N) region all these quantities were stable against
the normality change.

If we consider the ﬂow behavior index ¯n (not shown in the ﬁgure) averaged over
those obtained by the power-law analysis methods I and II (Fig. 1), the whole
normality region (0.09 - 0.175N) is divided into three regions by the value
of ¯n. The fow behavior index ¯n is larger than 1 (dilatancy) in the normality
region 0.14 - 0.16N and is smaller (pseudo-plasticity) in other two regions. We
note that the presence of the dilatancy in a certain normality region (0.15 -
0.16N) was also checked by use of the power-law analysis (the whole stress
region) computer program which is proper to the ﬂow mode of Rheology So-
lutions Software (TA Instruments, ver. 1.1.6) although the detailed statistical
procedure for its regression analysis is not manifest in this software.

Consistency coeﬃcient µ (Fig. 1) seems to grow abruptly at some normalities.
For non-Newtonian ﬂuids these changes of strength in a viscous property could
be quantitatively described in terms of apparent viscosity. Fig. 3 displays the
logarithm of apparent viscosity log10 ηa and its dependence on the normality
of added NaOH. This revealed that apparent viscosity ηa[Pa · s] staying at
10−3 - 10−2 scales in the region 0.09 - 0.14N, was abruptly enhanced when the
normality goes beyond 0.14N. After that, apparent viscosity seems to grow
exponentially with the increase of normality (0.14 - 0.17N), and at 0.175N
reaches almost 102[Pa · s] scales.

Time dependence: power-law analysis

Fig. 4 shows ﬂow behavior index n and consistency coeﬃcient µ respectively
as functions of a storage time (6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 230) after the addition of 0.146N
NaOH solution. In the time region 10 ≤ t[min] ≤ 23, the ﬂow behavior index
n obtained by the power-law analysis method II((cid:3)) was larger than 1, whereas
the index n obtained by the method I ((cid:4)) was smaller than 1. In that region,
the R2 value for the method I was reduced to approximately 0.9 (Fig. 5), and
the shear stress range obtained by the analysis method II (Fig. 5) was roughly
1 < σ[Pa] (i.e. y∗[Pa] ≈ 1) where the power-law approximation ﬁtted best
(maximum R2).

These results indicated that the ﬂow behavior of the sample is qualitatively
diﬀerent between in a smaller half (σ[Pa] < 1) and in a larger half (1 <
σ[Pa] < 2) of the whole stress region. The typical σ - ˙(cid:15) curve showing such a

8

behavior is displayed in Fig. 6a where the data at t[min] = 13 were plotted
in the whole stress region and a solid line (a Newtonian approximation) was
drawn as a reference.

From t[min] = 23 to 40, however, such a discrepancy for ﬂow behavior index
n was considerably reduced (Fig. 4). This fact was also observed for the R2
value (Fig. 5) and for the analysis range obtained by the method II (Fig. 5).
The typical result (t[min] = 25) is depicted in Fig. 6a with the Newtonian
approximation (a solid line). The power-law analysis method I provided n =
0.91 with a markedly high ﬁtting (R2 = 0.991).

After t[min] = 100, the R2 value for the power-law analysis method I was
reduced to being smaller than 0.90 (Fig. 5). However, it was always kept high
(R2 > 0.95) for the power-law analysis method II. These results indicated that
after t[min] = 100 the ﬂow behavior involved irregularity in a smaller stress
region and that the power-law model (1) did not ﬁt consistently in the whole
stress region. The typical example is exhibited in Fig. 6b (t[min] = 170) with
a power-law approximation (solid) curve, for which the power-law analysis
method I gives n = 0.63 with an extremely low ﬁtting R2 = 0.515 (Fig. 5).

If we judge from the time dependence of the ﬂow behavior index ¯n (data not
shown) averaged over those obtained by the power-law analysis methods I
and II (Fig. 4), the sample showed an apparently dilatant ﬂow (n > 1) from
t[min] = 12 to 21. On the other hand the time dependence of consistency co-
eﬃcient µ (Fig. 4) suggested that the viscosity growth of the sample might be
accelerated in some restricted time region (t[min] < 50). Such a kinetic charac-
teristic, however, must be veriﬁed with other well-deﬁned quantities because
ﬂow behavior index n and hence the dimension of consistency coeﬃcient µ
varied radically in the region t[min] < 50 (Fig. 4); one could not make a quan-
titative evaluation about the diﬀerence of consistency coeﬃcient µ(t1) − µ(t2)
unless n(t1) = n(t2).

In order to legally discuss about the increasing rate of some physical quantity
that could characterize the change of ﬂow properties, namely to construct the
kinetics of starch gelatinization in the language of rheology, we must consider
a quantity with a constant dimension, such as the viscosity deﬁned by the
Newtonian analysis.

Time dependence: Newtonian analysis

In Fig. 7 are exhibited the storage time dependences of viscosities obtained by
using the Newtonian analysis methods I and II, and of the apparent viscosity
ηa. Although some disorder was generated in the data distributions at t[min] >
50, the three η - t curves were regular and almost identical to each other (Fig. 8)

9

in the region t[min] < 40 where the validity of the Newtonian analysis was
suﬃciently high (R2 > 0.90) even in the whole stress region. Further, as shown
in Fig. 8, the viscosity - time curve possesses a globally downward curvature

d2η
dt2 > 0

(4)

This concave property of the η - t curve in the early stage of alkali gelatiniza-
tion was not observed in the case of the corresponding thermal gelatinization
(Kubota et al, 1979), and might suggest an essential diﬀerence between the
kinetic processes of these two types of starch gelatinizations.

Actually, a careful analysis of the η - t curves clariﬁed that for each deﬁnition
of viscosity an exponential ﬁtting proved to be a good approximation to a
certain region of each η - t curve. In Fig. 8 are displayed the best exponential
ﬁttings (solid curves) to the viscosity - time curves obtained respectively by the
Newtonian analysis method I (6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 35, R2 = 0.993), II (6 ≤ t[min] ≤
36, R2 = 0.995) and as apparent viscosity (6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 35, R2 = 0.992). In
this ﬁgure linear approximations (dotted lines) were also added to demonstrate
the concave property of the η - t curves.

After the exponential growth region, viscosity seemed to rise almost linearly in
the middle region t[min] ≥ 36 (Fig. 7). This fact was quantitatively checked for
all deﬁnitions of viscosity although the best linear regions were not common
among them.

The value of viscosity took the maximum roughly at 160 - 170[min] (Fig. 7).
The gelatinized starch might then reach an equilibrium state, but the viscosity
- time data were not stable. As seen from Figs. 4, 5 and 6b the σ - ˙(cid:15) data
themselves were irregular in that time region, and a Newtonian property was
lost (Fig. 4). This irregularity of the η - t data might be a disadvantage of the
present experimental institution, i.e. a rather high starch concentration and
the measurement by a cone-plate type viscometer. If the regular data could
be obtained by some adequate method, the η - t data should be observed
to approach smoothly to the equilibrium value ηG with the convex property
d2η/dt2 < 0.

On the other hand, the σ - ˙(cid:15) data were regular (see e.g. Fig. 6a) at 10 -
40[min], and a quite high validity (R2 > 0.93) was achieved for the Newtonian
approximation to them. Further, the η - t data had very little dependence
on the analysis method (Fig. 8). We therefore conclude that viscosity of rice
starch dispersion increased exponentially in the early stage (10 - 36[min]) of
alkali gelatinization. This result is diﬀerent even qualitatively from that known
for the ordinary case, i.e. the thermal gelatinization of rice starch in a neutral
pure water (Kubota et al, 1979).

Theoretical analysis

The experimental results for the time dependence of viscosity presented in the
previous section suggested the necessity to introduce a new idea for the kinetic
treatment of the starch gelatinization under strong alkali conditions. In this
section we propose the new treatment based on the general idea of the mixing
rule of viscosity for ungelatinized and gelatinized fractions of starch under
gelatinization, and compare the derived consequence with the experimental
results.

Starch gelatinization kinetics with mixing rule

Starch gelatinization phenomenon is described as a kind of chemical reaction
process, in which an ungelatinized part UG of starch is changed to a gelatinized
part G. Then, the sum of their amounts [UG] and [G] should equal to the
amount of an ungelatinized part UG at the initial time (denoted by the symbol
0) of gelatinization, i.e.

The fundamental hypothesis of gelatinazation kinetics is that the ungelatinized
part obeys a general n-th order reaction rate equation

where Kn denotes an n-th order reaction rate constant. Gelatinization degree
x and hence ungelatinization degree 1−x are deﬁned respectively as the ratios
of [G] and [UG] to [UG0]

[UG] + [G] = [UG]0

where the second equality follows from (5). Using this relation one can rewrite
a general n-th order reaction rate equaion (6) as

where ˜Kn ≡ Kn[UG]n−1
is a new n-th order reaction rate constant of (time)−1
dimension. In most of the past researches, people have made sure from various

approaches that the simplest choice n = 1 worked for starch gelatinization
kinetics (e.g. Lund (1984)). Under the initial condition x(t = 0) = 0, equation
(8) with n = 1, i.e. the ﬁrst-order reaction rate equation possesses the solution

Many investigators have so far related the above gelatinization degree x with
physically, chemically and biochemically measured quantities (e.g. Lund (1984)).
Among them, Kubota et al (1979) expressed gelatinization degree x in terms
of the viscosity or exactly speaking the ﬂuid consistency index K in their
literature 1 by

x = 1 − e−K1t

x =

K − K0
Ke − K0

where K0 and Ke denote respectively the ﬂuid consistency indices at the initial
time and at the equilibrium. Replacing these consistency indices K, K0 and
Ke in (10) by the corresponding viscosities η, ηUG and ηG, we get the relation

η = ηUG(1 − x) + ηGx

with η the viscosity of the sample dispersion under gelatinization. Here ηUG
and ηG denote respectively the proper viscosities of ungelatinized (UG) and
gelatinized (G) parts of the sample satisfying ηUG < ηG.

Equation (11) can be regarded as an additive mixing rule of viscosity with
respect to ungelatinized and gelatinized fractions. Substituing of the ﬁrst-
order solution (9) for x in the mixing rule (11) leads to the storage time
dependence of viscosity

η(t) = ηG − e−K1t(ηG − ηUG)

Its second derivative with respect to time t is calculated with the result

implying that the viscosity - time curve is always convex at t < ∞. This
consequence had really held in the case of thermal gelatinization (Kubota et
1 Their deﬁnition of the ﬂuid consistency index K is diﬀerent from that of the
consistency coeﬃcient µ used here. The ﬂow behavior index in their literature cor-
responds to the inverse of that used in the present article. Also, one should not
confuse it with our symbol Kn of a reaction rate constant.

al, 1979) but is clearly in contradiction to the present experimental results. If
we want to keep the ﬁrst-order reaction hypothesis (9), we are then forced to
seek for other types of mixing rule than the formula (11).

The mixing rule (11) can be regarded as the special case (ν = 1) of the
following general power-law formula

ην = ην

UG(1 − x) + ην

Gx

with an exponent ν a free dimensionless mixing parameter. We consider this
free parameter to reﬂect the various characteristics of sample starch disper-
sions such as starch spieces and/or environmental conditions.

Then, another typical case of (14) could be that with ν = −1, in which instead
of viscosity η itself ﬂuidity, i.e. the inverse of viscosity η−1 should obey the
additive law

φ = φUG(1 − x) + φGx

where φ(≡ η−1) represents the ﬂuidity of the sample dispersion, and φUG(≡
−1
−1
UG) and φG(≡ η
η
G ) should satisfy the condition φUG > φG. Substituing of the
ﬁrst-order solution (9) for (15) provides the ﬂuidity as a function of a storage
time, expressed by

φ(t) = η−1(t) = φG + e−K1t(φUG − φG)

From this the second derivative of viscosity is calculated with the result

dt2 =

(17)

(cid:17)

Since the ﬁrst fractional factor in the right-hand side is always positive, the
def
= (φUG − φG) e−K1t − φG,
sign of (17) is determined by the second factor D(t)
which is a monotonously decreasing function of gelatinization time t, and is
negative at the equilibrium D(∞) = −φG. Therefore, if D(0) = φUG − 2φG is
positive, i.e. ηG > 2ηUG, the sign of second derivative d2η/dt2 becomes positive
before a certain gelatinization time t∗

(0 ≤ t < t∗)

Note that the condition ηG > 2ηUG could reasonably be satisﬁed for real
starch samples including the present case. The theoretical result (18) implies

13

that the shape of the viscosity - time curve is concave in the ﬁrst half (t < t∗)
of gelatinization process.

Application of the theory (ν = −1) to the experimental results

The logical consequence derived from the above kinetic treatment based on the
combination of the ﬁrst-order solution (9) with the mixing rule of ﬂuidity (15)
seems qualitatively consistent with the storage time dependence of viscosity
observed for the present alkali gelatinization of rice starch. Irrespective of the
deﬁnitions of viscosity, the viscosity - time curve was actually concave in the
early (t[min] < 40) stage of the gelatinization process (Fig. 8). This concave
property of the η - t curve was not seen in the corresponding K - t curve
for the thermal gelatinization of rice starch (Kubota et al, 1979), and cannot
be theoretically understood by combining the ﬁrst-order reaction hypothesis
with the mixing rule of viscosity (11). In this subsection, we would like to give
some more quantitaive comparison with the experimental data.

Under the condition ηUG (cid:28) ηG, which is actually possible, equation (16) can
be legitimately reduced to

φ(t) = η−1(t) = φUGe−K1t

unless an inequality K1t (cid:29) 1 is satisﬁed. This means that viscosity should
exhibit an exponential increase

η(t) = ηUGeK1t

(19)

(20)

in a certain initial stage of gelatinization. As demonstrated in Fig. 8 we in
fact conﬁrmed this exponential increase to ﬁt with the observed viscosity -
time data in the region 6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 35 or 36. The ﬁtting was attained with
markedly high accuracy (R2 > 0.99) for all deﬁnitions of viscosity. From these
exponential analyses (Fig. 8), a rate constant K1[min−1] was estimated to be
0.165 - 0.168, and the value of ηUG[Pa·s] was predicted to be about 1.2 × 10−3.
This scale of ηUG is smaller by O(10−4) compared with that of ηG evaluated
from the experimental result (Fig. 7), and proved the consistency (ηUG (cid:28) ηG)
of the present exponential reduction.

Without using such a truncation of the theory, however, we can make a quan-
titative comparison between the full content (16) of the theory and the exper-
imental data. Equation (16) can be exactly transformed to

ln(φ − φG) = −K1t + ln(φUG − φG)

(21)

14

This relation states that the quantity ln(φ − φG) converted from the experi-
mental η - t data should be linear in t with the coeﬃcient K1. Then, the precise
estimation of a rate constant K1 only requires to know from the experiment
a constant φG(= η−1

G ).

As we have already remarked in the previous section, the present experimental
data involved some irregular distribution at the ﬁnal stage of gelatinization.
Although the viscosity at the equilibrium ηG was therefore not deﬁnite (Fig. 7),
we shall take, as a working hypothesis, the values of ηG[Pa·s] to be 30 for the
Newtonian analysis method I, and 35 for the method II and for apparent
viscosity. These values were roughly estimated from the data in Fig. 7.

For each deﬁnition of viscosity, the quantity ln(φ − φG) was then plotted as a
function of storage time. In Fig. 9 is shown the result for the viscosity obtained
by the Newtonian analysis method I. We have checked that for all deﬁnitions
of viscosity a high linearity (R2 > 0.90) was maintained in a rather broad data
region 6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 110. The value of a rate constant K1[min−1] was about
0.10 - 0.11, which would give an averaged rate constant of gelatinization in
almost all of the total reaction time.

A further investigation revealed that the above time region was divided into
plural regions with diﬀerent values of a rate constant K1. For example, the
ln(φ − φG) - t data of the Newtonian analysis method I was separated into at
least three regions (Fig. 9).

First, in the region 6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 35 the highest linearity (R2 = 0.993) was
realized with K1[min−1] = 0.166. Secondly, within the remaining range 36 ≤ t,
the R2 value became highest (= 0.967) in the region 36 ≤ t[min] ≤ 55 with
the smaller value of a rate constant K1[min−1] = 0.103. In the third region
56 ≤ t[min] ≤ 130, R2 took the highest value (R2 = 0.896) in the rest (56 ≤ t)
of the time range, and a rate constant was further reduced to be K1[min−1] =
0.042.

The ln(φ−φG) - t data derived by the Newtonian analysis method II and those
from apparent viscosity indicated similar behaviors to the above, although
these data are not displayed here. Especially the rate constant K1[min−1] in the
ﬁrst region 6 ≤ t[min] ≤ 35 or 36 took almost the same values 0.167(±0.01),
which were also very close to those obtained by an exponential approximation
(Fig. 8). They were all reduced in the later stages.

Discussions

Diﬀerence of mixing rule

As seen in the previous section, the viscosity of rice starch under the present
alkali gelatinization showed the kinetic behavior which is diﬀerent from that of
the corresponding thermal gelatinization (Kubota et al., 1979). This diﬀerence
was mathematically characterized by diﬀerent forms of mixing rule (11) and
(15), in other words, the diﬀerent relations between viscosity and gelatinization
degree.

In order to gain an insight into the physical meaning of these mixing rules,
it is helpful to describe the gelatinization process controlled by these typical
mixing rules in terms of the ﬂow composition models (Fig. 10). In this model,
the ﬂow part −→ with a long arrow expresses UG with a large proper

ﬂuidity φUG (a small viscosity ηUG) and that → with a short arrow does G
with a small proper ﬂuidity φG (a large viscosity ηG).

Although the initial (x = 0) and ﬁnal (x = 1) states are common, mixed
states in the middle (e.g. x = 1/2) of reaction are diﬀerent between ν = 1 and
ν = −1 (Fig. 10). The additive viscosity mixing rule with ν = 1 expressed in
terms of ﬂuidity

φ−1 = φ−1

UG(1 − x) + φ−1
G x

(22)

is symbolized by the series-type composition model of ﬂuidity where shear
stress is additive and shear rate is kept constant in the mixed state. The
viscosity of whole sample increases linearly with the increase (decrease) of the
high (low) viscous ﬂuid →

−→

(cid:18)

.
(cid:19)

In contrast, the additive mixing rule of ﬂuidity (ν = −1) given by equation
(15) is symbolized by the parallel-type composition model of ﬂuidity where
shear stress is kept constant and shear rate is additive in the mixed state.
This intuitively suggests that in the initial stage of gelatinization the ﬂuidity
of the whole sample is largely dominated by UG −→ and that the increase
of G does not directly (lineary) aﬀect to the increase of the viscosity of whole
sample.

To make this intuitive argument more transparent, we introduce the dimen-
sionless ﬂuidities Φ ≡ φ/φUG(= ηUG/η) and ΦG ≡ φG/φUG(= ηUG/ηG < 1)
and rewrite the mixing rules (22) and (15) as

Φ = 1 − (1 − ΦG)x

(ν = 1)
(ν = −1)

For the latter (ν = −1) the derivatives of (dimensionless) viscosity Φ−1 with
respect to gelatinization degree are calculated with the results

ν=1

This implies that in the initial stage of gelatinization, the viscosity increasing
ratio to gelatinization degree is smaller in the case ν = −1 than that in the
case ν = 1. In Fig. 11 is described the example of whole relative viscosity Φ−1 -
gelatinization degree x curves controlled by both mixing rules (ν = ±1) where
ΦG is commonly set to be 0.1. In both cases the dimensionless viscosity Φ−1
starts from 1 and increases toward Φ−1
G (= 10 in Fig. 11), but along diﬀerent
paths.

For ν = 1, the whole viscosity Φ−1 increases lineary with the increase (de-
crease) of G (UG). Whereas for ν = −1, even if G occupies partially (x (cid:28) 1)
UG dominates the whole ﬂuidity, as was intuitively suggested from the ﬂow
composition model (Fig. 10). Hence the viscosity increase with ν = −1 is
milder than that with ν = 1, and the relative viscosity Φ−1 - gelatinization
degree curve becomes concave (Fig. 11), which contributes to the concavity
property of the ﬁrst half (t < t∗) of the viscosity - time curve (18). This would
physically indicate that in the initial stage (x (cid:28) 1) of the gelatinization the
independecy of G is so high that its appearance does not directly contribute
to the viscosity increase of whole sample (UG + G). The result of our experi-
ment showed that this propery is realized for the kinetic characteristic of alkali
gelatinization of rice starch.

Hypothesis of alkali induced complex formation

Then, we should next discuss the physicochemical reason why such a rhe-
ologically high independency of G is realized only for alkali gelatinization.
Physically starch consists of amorphous and crystallite regions, and the gela-
tinization initially occurs in the former. It was proposed that the swelling of
amorphous phase contributes to the disruption of the crystallites and that the
gelatinization is a (semi-)cooperative process (Marchant & Blanshard, 1978;

17

French, 1984). On the other hand, starch is chemically a mixed system of
amylose and amylopectin, and for the starches from cereal grains such as rice
starch (the present sample) the former forms an inclusion complex with lipids.
The major fatty acids of lipids bonded to rice starch are palmitic and linolenic
acids.

This amylose - lipid complex originally present in the ungelatinized starch
is known to suppress the gelatinization and swelling of starch granules, al-
though this complex would become unstable and might break down at very
high temperatures. In the present experiment, the gelatinization proceeded
at 20◦C and hence the amylose - lipid complexes would not be instabilized
thermodynamically.

However, the added NaOH could bring a chemical instability to original amy-
lose - lipid complex. I t is widely recognized that amylose is able to capture
many kinds of compounds including alkali hydroxides such as NaOH and to
form various types of complexes (see Tomasik & Schilling (1998a,b) for recent
comprehensive reviews). Such complex formations of amylose could generally
aﬀect the gelatinization behavior, and in some cases were reported to bring
drastic changes (Lindqvist, 1979; Larsson, 1980).

In addition to the direct complex formation between amylose and NaOH,
another possibility of a new strong complex formation of amylose caused by
NaOH addition must be pointed out. After NaOH penetrates into starch gran-
ule, the lipids originally included in amylose could react with NaOH to gener-
ate the sodium salts of higher fatty acids. These sodium salts (soap) of higher
fatty acids such as palmitic acid, should work as strong surfactants with large
hydrophobic groups and hydrophilic groups, and could form new strong and
stable complexes with amylose. The main driving force of this complex forma-
tion is a hydrophobic bond, which is further strengthened by the existence of a
hydrophilic group with polarity. Some of the ionic surfactants were suggested
to be able to complex even with amylopectin (Evans, 1986).

Actually such an eﬀect of surfactants or emulsiﬁers to form strong complexes
with starches, has been utilized in modifying the texture of starch products
(Krog, 1971). Gray and Schoch (1962) reported that polar surfactants which
complex strongly with amylose restricted the swelling and solubilization of
various starches over the pasting range 60 - 95◦C.

At the present low experimental temperatures (20◦C) the amylose - fatty acid
complexes are expected to be thermodynamically stable. These strong and
stable amylose complexes, thus generated in the amorphous region, would
form isolated objects in starch granule. As the result, in comparison with
thermal gelatinization, the initial stage of alkali gelatinization would become
unable to cooperatively induce strain in the crystallites of amylopectin; the

18

swelling speed of starch granule is thus suppressed in the initial stage. This
situation might be linked with the rheologically high independency of G and
the reduction of the inﬂuence on UG. Anyhow we hypothesize that such a
structural change of the gelatinized state of starch could lead to the observed
kinetic diﬀerence of viscosity. To elucidate the detailed mechanism, however,
further studies would be necessary.

Conclusions and remarks

Conclusions

The ﬂow characteristics of rice starch (3.8wt%) gelatinized by NaOH solution
(20◦C) were studied. The power-law and the Newtonian models were adopted
in analyzing the measured ﬂow data. Viscosity was deﬁned in three kinds of
manners according to the analysis procedures.

When 0.14 - 0.16N NaOH were added, the starch dispersion stored for 10[min]
showed an apparently dilatant ﬂow. As the normality of NaOH increased,
apparent viscosity was rapidly enhanced in the vicinity of 0.16N and started
to grow almost exponentially.

The storage (gelatinization) time dependence of viscosity was investigated for
the sample added with 0.146N NaOH, and turned out to be qualitatively dif-
ferent from that of thermal gelatinization in a neutral pure water. Remarkably,
the viscosity - time curve showed an exponential growth in the early stage of
gelatinization. This fact was conﬁrmed irrespective of diﬀerent deﬁnitions of
viscosity, and was imcompatible with the ﬁrst-order kinetic treatment which
was previously taken for thermal gelatinization.

We thus proposed a kinetic treatment involving a viscosity mixing rule of
general power-law type. It was argued that the time dependence of viscosity
in the present alkali gelatinization could be described by a ﬁrst-order reac-
tion hypothesis combined with the mixing rule of ﬂuidity. The application
of this theoretical treatment to the experimental data suggested that the al-
kali gelatinization process of rice starch dispersion consisted of plural phases
characterized by diﬀerent values of a rate constant.

Remarks

As the device of viscosity measurement we have used the cone-plate type rota-
tional viscometer . This instrument was adequate to our purpose since it was

19

useful not only for the Newtonian analysis but also for the power-law analysis
to the ﬂow data. For the time dependence of viscosity, we have checked that
at least qualitatively the similar results to the present ones were obtained for
dilute rice starch dispersions by performing a continuous measurement with
use of a capillary viscometer. The continuous capillary viscometry is appropri-
ate only for the measurement of apparent viscosity of dilute dispersions but
could provide regular ﬂow data even after a long gelatinization time.

It is not deﬁnite that the (apparent) dilatancy property observed in the sam-
ples added with 0.14 - 0.16N NaOH is really an intrinsic property of starch
dispersion, because the present sample under measurement is not in the equi-
librium state. The gelatinization of sample and hence the viscosity growth
should slightly proceed even in 2.0 min of measurement. Such a “time eﬀect”
cannot be avoided in the present experimental situation and would always
work toward enlarging ﬂow behavior index n, i.e. dilatancy. On this point,
further investigations would be necessary to have a deﬁnite conclusion.

In the theoretical aspect we have restricted the premise of our kinetic treat-
ment to the ﬁrst-order (n = 1) reaction model and to the typical choices of
a mixing parameter ν = ±1. Some possible arguments including a general
n-th order kinetics with a general value of a mixing parameter ν, as well as
the experimental results obtained by the capillary viscometry, will appear in
forthcoming articles. The inﬂuences of temperature, starch species and other
solutes than NaOH would also be interesting subjects to be pursued experi-
mentally in the future.

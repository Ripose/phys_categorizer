Abstract: 

A  nanofabricated  regular  array  of  coupled  gold  nano-pillars  is  employed  to  detect 

local  indices  of  refraction  of  different  liquids  using  a  shift  of  an  antisymmetric 

plasmon  resonance  peak  observed  in  the  reflection  spectra.  The  peak’s  spectral 

position is found to be a unique function of the local refractive index for a wide range 

of indices. We discuss possible applications of the fabricated nanostructured arrays in 

bio- and chemical sensors.

Plasmon resonances (selective excitation of localised vibrations of the electron 

plasma  in  metals  by  electromagnetic  field)  turned  out  to  be  a  valuable  tool  in  the 

development  of  new  optical  devices.  Surface  plasmons  [1]  produced  in  different 

configurations  (e.g.,  in  Kretschmann  [2]  or  Otto  [3]  geometries)  have  been 

extensively  used  in  a  large  variety  of  tools  and  techniques  for  bio-  and  chemical 

sensing, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors [4], commercially available 

from  Biacore,  surface  plasmon  microscopy  [5],  colorimetric  detection  of  DNA  by 

gold  nanoparticles  [6],  etc.  The  sensitivity  of  surface  plasmon  techniques  has  been 

improved to just one atomic monolayer by using interferometry [7, 8] and dark-field 

techniques [9]. 

Most  of  the  initial  success  of  plasmonic  optics  was  achieved  by  exploiting 

plasmon  resonances  in  thin  metallic  films.  However,  the  advent  of  nanofabrication 

allowed  one  to  create  controlled  arrays  of  nanoparticles  and  nanostructures,  also 

possessing  plasmon  resonant  modes  of  electron  vibrations.  These  plasmon  modes 

retain  the  high  sensitivity  of  plasmon  resonances  to  the  environment  but  provide  a 

local  response  and  compatibility  with  the  high-throughput  techniques  required  by 

biophysics. As a result, plasmonic optics has benefited from the discovery of plasmon 

assisted  extraordinary  transmission  of  light  [10],  detection  of  polynucleotides  based 

on distance-dependent optical properties of nanoparticles [11], light concentration in 

self-similar chains of metal nanospheres [12], detection of local refractive index from 

individual nanoparticles [13].  Nanoparticles with resonant plasmonic  modes made it 

possible  to  create  novel  artificial  materials  based  on  metallic  “nano-atoms”  and 

“nano-molecules” with unique optical properties unachievable in natural materials. 

Recently we have fabricated a new artificial nano-medium formed by regular 

arrays  of  “nano-molecules”  -  pairs  of  coupled  identical  gold  nano-pillars  with 

 

plasmon  resonances  in  the  visible  part  of  the  spectrum  [14].  In  this  material,  which 

may  be  referred  to  as  optomagnetic  [14,  15],  a  plasmon  resonance  mode  of  a 

nanoparticle  splits  into  two  resonant  modes  for  a  particle  pair:  a  symmetric  mode, 

characterized  by  an  overall  dipole  response  and  contributing  to  the  medium’s 

permittivity, and an antisymmetric mode, in which the dipoles oscillate in antiphase 

cancelling the dipole response and leaving the overall magnetic response contributing 

to  the  magnetic  permeability  [15,16].  The  purpose  of  this  work  is  to  show  that  the 

antisymmetric  plasmon  resonance  mode  of  the  coupled  nano-pillars  can  be  used  to 

detect  local  changes  of  the  refractive  index  with  high  sensitivity  in  a  wide  range  of 

refractive  indices.  Combined  with  a  relatively  simple  design,  controlled  nature  of 

resonance splitting, compatibility with high-throughput screening and a simple optical 

scheme  for  plasmon  excitation,  the  proposed  medium  has  a  potential  to  find  a  wide 

range of applications in bio- and chemical sensors. 

Figure 1(a) shows an electron micrograph of one of our samples. The prepared 

structures  were  regular  arrays  of  Au  pillars  fabricated  by  high-resolution  electron-

beam  lithography  on  a  glass  substrate  and  grouped  in  tightly  spaced  pairs.  The 

structures  typically  covered  an  area  of  ≈0.1mm2  and  contained  ≈106  pillars.  The 

lattice constant, a, for periodic arrays was in the range 400-600nm. Heights h of Au 

pillars  and  their  diameters  were  chosen  through  numerical  simulations  so  that  the 

plasmon  resonance  in  the  reference  samples  appeared  at  red-light  wavelengths.  A 

number of different structures were studied with d between 80 and 160nm and the pair 

separations s between the centres of adjacent pillars in the range 140 to 200nm and, 

i.e. the gap s–d between the neighbouring pillars varied from 100nm down to almost 

zero  (overlapping  pillars).  At  these  separations,  the  electromagnetic  interaction 

between  the  nanopillars  splits  plasmon  resonances,  and  plasmonic  modes  of  the 

 

“nano-molecule”  can  be  characterised  by their parity. Figures 1(b)  and  (c) show  the 

current  distributions  for  the  symmetric  and  antisymmetric  z-modes,  respectively, 

calculated  with  the  electromagnetic  module  of  Femlab  software  for  the  actual 

experimental  geometry.  The  symmetric  z-mode  is  characterised  by  non-zero  dipole 

moment directed along the z-axis. The overall dipole moment of the antisymmetric z-

mode  is  zero  and  the  circulating  currents  in  the  x-z  plane  produce  the  magnetic 

moment along the y-axis. There exist three main symmetric and three antisymmetric 

resonant modes in an interacting pair with currents flowing along the x-, y- and z-axes. 

Excitation  of  these  modes  depends  on  the  symmetry  of  the  pillar  pair  and  the 

conditions of light incidence. In our case, an efficient coupling of resonant modes to 

incident  light  has  been  insured  by  non-cylindrical  geometry  of  pillars  which  was 

intentionally introduced in the design through a choice of microfabrication procedures 

(double layered resist). 

Figures 1(d) and (e) show typical reflection spectra measured from the sample 

of  Fig.  1(a)  under  the  condition  of  normal  light  incidence  for  TM  light  (with  the 

electric field vector along the x-axis) and TE light (with the electric field vector along 

the  y-axis),  respectively.  The  reflection  spectra  were  collected  by  a  conventional 

spectrophotometer  from  an  area  of  100×100  µm2.  There  are  two  distinct  resonance 

peaks in the TM spectrum indicated by arrows and only one peak in the TE spectrum. 

The  symmetry  analysis  and  the  numerical  solution  of  Maxwell  equations  for  the 

experimental geometry with Femlab software [14] (the results are shown in the insets 

of  Fig.  1(d)  and  (e)  for  the  resonant  wavelengths)  proves  that  the  weaker  resonance 

peak  (observed  at  green  wavelength)  corresponds  to  the  antisymmetric  z-mode  and 

the  stronger  peaks  of  Fig.  1(d)  and  (e)  (observed  at  red  wavelengths)  correspond  to 

the  symmetric  x-  and  y-modes  of  plasmonic  resonances,  respectively.  It  is  worth 

 

noting that diffraction modes do not contribute to generation of the resonant peaks, as 

the  fabricated  structures  with  different  periodicities  (a=400nm  and  600nm)  and 

random  arrays  of  pairs  of  the  same  geometry  (sizes  and  separation  inside  the  pair) 

have resonance peaks at the same spectral positions. 

The plasmonic resonances shown in Figs. 1(d) and (e) are excited by light of 

normal incidence (see schematic view of the experimental set-up in Fig. 2(a)) and do 

not  require  an  elaborate  optical  scheme  of  Kretschmann  or  Otto  geometries.  This 

implies  that  our  medium  can  be  easily  combined  with  sensing  techniques  based  on 

any  kind  of  reflection  or  microscopy.  We  demonstrate  this  by  employing  our 

structures to detect local refractive indices of optically-thin liquid layers. Figure 2(b) 

shows the TM spectra of the sample of Fig. 1(a) covered with a thin layer of liquid 

taken  at  intervals  as  the  liquid  was  drying  (curves  1-3).  Initially,  the  reflection 

spectrum (curve 1) shows an interference pattern produced by the interference of light 

reflected from the top and the bottom of the liquid layer. The positions of minima in 

the  interference  pattern  can  be  found  from  the  condition  [17] 

nD

=

(2

m λ

+

/ 4

, 

where n is the refractive index of the liquid layer, D is the layer thickness and m≥0 is 

an integer. As the liquid dries up, D decreases and the interference pattern gradually 

disappears (compare curves 1 and 2) eventually leaving spectrum 3 without any trace 

of interference (which implies that D<<λ/4n). The final spectrum (curve 3) shows the 

peaks of the plasmon resonances due to the nanostructured media and did not change 

for  several  hours  after  initial  drying  (even  days  for  some  liquids).  Using  Fresnel 

reflection  coefficients  [17]  to  model  the  change  of  the  interference  pattern  of  Fig. 

2(b), we can obtain a rough estimate of the average effective thickness of dried liquid 

as  <50nm.  We  believe,  however,  that  the  liquid  is  mostly  concentrated  “inside”  the 

“nano-molecules” (between pillars in a pair) and is dried completely in areas between 

 

“nano-molecules”. Below we shall refer to the final stable spectrum as the spectrum 

of  samples  covered  with  optically-thin  layers  of  liquid.  Before  every  series  of 

measurements, the samples were cleaned by rinsing in acetone, propanol and blowing 

dry  by  compressed  nitrogen.  The  cleaning  procedure  removed  the  liquid  completely 

and restored the original reflection spectrum of the sample shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e). 

The important property of the spectra of structures covered with an optically-

thin layer of liquid is an increase of the amplitude of the antisymmetric resonance and 

a  substantial  red  shift  of  the  resonance  peak.  (It  worth  noting  that  the  symmetric 

resonance  peak  was  also  red-shifted  albeit  decreased  in  the  amplitude  [14].)  These 

features are emphasised in Fig. 3(a), where the spectra measured in normal TM light 

for  the  sample  of  Fig.  1(a)  covered  with  different  liquids  are  presented.  One  can 

notice  that  the  change  in  reflection  around  the  antisymmetric  resonance  for,  e.  g., 

spectrum  4  of  Fig.  3(a)  is  ≈6%  (the  spectrum  corresponds  to  optical  coupling  fluid 

OCF463). This change is about 3 times greater than that for the spectrum of the clean 

sample (Fig. 1(b), ≈2%). It is also clear that the resonance peak is red-shifted in Fig. 

3(a)  by  ≈30-60nm  with  respect  to  the  original  spectral  peak’s  position  in  TM 

spectrum  of  Fig.  1(b).  We  extracted  the  spectral  position  of  the  antisymmetric 

resonance peak from the spectra and plotted it as a function of the refractive index of 

the liquid in Fig. 3(b). Figure 3(b) demonstrates the main experimental result of this 

letter:  in  a  wide  range  of  refractive  indices  (from  1.3  to  1.7)  there  exists  a  unique 

(close  to  linear)  dependence  between  the  refractive  index  of  an  optically-thin  liquid 

layer  covering  the  fabricated  metamaterial  and  the  shift  of  the  antisymmetric 

resonance. The observed shift was about 2.8nm per 0.01 index of refraction. This is 

comparable with the red-shifts recorded previously for the quadrupole resonance of an 

individual nanoparticle [13] (1.6nm per 0.01) but less than that for the conventional 

 

SPR  technique  (≈5-7nm  per  0.01)  [1,2].  However,  none  of  the  previous  techniques 

works in such a large range of refractive indices and has the simplicity of the plasmon 

excitation and spectrum registration. 

We  briefly  discuss  the  dependence  of  the  resonance  shifts  on  the  refractive 

index  of  the  environment.  The  reflection  spectra  of  our  samples  can  be  calculated 

numerically  by  direct  solving  of  Maxwell  equations  for  the  experimental  geometry, 

see  Ref.  [14]  for  details.  The  extracted  resonance  shift  is  a  complex  function  of  the 

refractive  index  of  the  environment  (determined  by  the  structure  geometry,  metal 

constants  and  substrate  properties).  It  would  be  of  great  benefit,  however,  to 

approximate  this  function  by  a  simple  analytical  expression.  This  cannot  be  done 

within the well-developed Mie theory because of non-spherical nature of nano-pillars 

and the strong electromagnetic interaction between pillars in the pairs. Instead, we use 

a theory [15], which takes into account the effects of the particle interaction and the 

environment  through  Leontovich  boundary  conditions  and  yields  an  analytical 

expression  for  the  resonance  wavelengths  of  a  double-wire  nano-molecule.  The 

wavelength  of  the  antisymmetric  resonance  λanti  can  be  found  from  the  implicit 

formula [15]

measured  dependence  presented  in  Fig.  3(b).  It  is  necessary  to  stress  that  (3)  is 

calculated near the limit of the applicability of the theory [15]. (The theory requires 

2h>d and works the best at 2h>>d while 2h/d is ≈1.2 in our case.) For this reason, we 

regard  (1)-(3)  only  as  a  useful  analytical  approximation  which  is  proved  to  work 

reasonably well for the studied structures. 

The lateral resolution with which the reflection spectra were recorded in our 

experiments was about 100µm. It can be reduced to 10µm by using stronger objective 

lenses  and/or  by  engineering  microarrays  of  cells  (based  on  the  proposed 

metastructures)  either  with  electron  lithography  or  microcontact  printing  [18].  This 

would  allow  one  to  study  the  refractive  index  of  an  unknown  liquid  and  to  perform 

high-throughput screening [19] on an almost micrometer scale. The spatial resolution 

of  the  analysis  can  be  improved  further  down  to  1µm  by  using  other  methods  of 

surface microscopies. For example, it is known that electromagnetic fields are greatly 

enhanced near the metal in the presence of plasmonic modes, which leads to surface 

enhanced  Raman  scattering  (SERS)  [20,  21].  This  implies  that  the  fabricated  nano-

medium might be useful as a substrate for SERS. Indeed, Fig. 4 shows a fragment of 

the Raman spectra measured using Renishaw Raman Microscope (System 2000) for 

the structures of Fig. 1(a) (illuminated by TM and TE light of wavelength λ=532nm) 

and the glass substrate covered by 2-propanol. In all measurements, the SERS spectra 

 

were  collected  from  a  1µm  spot  (using  ×50  objective).  The  magnitude  of  the  SERS 

peak  for  the  structure  is  about  4000  times  larger  than  for  the  glass  substrate,  which 

gives a rough estimate of the local field enhancement of 8, confirmed by the Femlab 

numerical  calculations  described  above.  We  also  note  that  the  SERS  peak  for  TM 

polarization  (where  the  antisymmetric  mode  of  the  plasmon  resonance  is  excited  at 

λ=532nm)  is  about  7  times  greater  than  for  TE  polarization,  in  agreement  with  the 

reflection spectra of Fig. 1(b). It is apparent that SERS is superior in resolution and 

sensitivity,  as  compared  to  measurements  of  the  reflection  spectra.  However,  the 

practicality of its use for cheap high-throughput screening is doubtful. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  shift  of  the  antisymmetric 

plasmon resonance of the media produced by pairs of identical gold nano-pillars can 

be  applied  to  detect  local  refractive  indices  of  optically-thin  layers  of  liquids.  This 

method provides a micrometer spatial resolution and a very high sensitivity (≈3nm per 

0.01  of  the  refractive  index)  in  a  wide  range  of  refractive  indices  (from  1.3  to  1.7). 

The  simple  optical  scheme  for  plasmon  excitation  and  compatibility  with  high-

throughput analysis suggest that the fabricated media can be successfully used for bio- 

and chemical sensing.

Abstract 

This  chapter  deals  with  atom-wall  interaction  occurring  in  the  "long-range"  regime  (typical 

distances:  1-1000 nm),  when  the  electromagnetic  fluctuations  of  an  isolated  atom  are 

modified  by  the  vicinity  with  a  surface.  Various  regimes  of  interaction  are  discussed  in  an 

Introductory  part,  from  Cavity  Quantum  ElectroDynamics  modifications  of  the  spontaneous 

emission,  to  Casimir  effect,  with  emphasis  on  the  atom-surface  van  der  Waals  interaction, 

characterized as a near-field interaction governed by a z-3 dependence. The major part of the 

Chapter  focuses  on  the  experimental  measurements  of  this  van  der  Waals  interaction, 

reviewing  various  recent  techniques,  and  insists  upon  optical  techniques,  and  notably 

selective  reflection  spectroscopy  which  is  particularly  well-suited  when  excited  atoms  are 

considered. A review of various experiments illustrates the specific effects associated with a 

resonant  coupling  between  the  atomic  excitation  and  surface  modes,  from  van  der  Waals 

repulsion  to  surface-induced  resonant  transfer,  and  with  anisotropy  effects,  including 

metastability transfer induced by a quadrupole contribution in the interaction. The effects of a 

thermal excitation of the surface -with a possible remote energy transfer to an atom-, and of 

interaction with nanobodies -which are intrinsically non planar- are notably discussed among 

the prospects.

Introduction

The van der Waals (vW) attraction between two bodies is an ubiquitous phenomenon 

in  nature,  notably  important  to  explain  cohesion  properties  of  materials.  It  originates  in  the 

correlation between the unavoidable electromagnetic (e.m.) field fluctuations (of quantum or 

thermal  origin)  of  the  two  facing  bodies.  In  spite  of  its  extreme  importance,  direct  physical 

measurements of this fundamental attraction are actually scarce. These effects are intimately 

connected  to  the  Casimir  attraction  (Casimir  1948),  a  paradigm  essential    for  Quantum 

Electrodynamics  (QED)  (for  a  review  see  e.g.  Bordag  et  al.,  2001),  and  of  fundamental 

importance in many problems, including the determination of the cosmological constant. The 

Casimir  force  describes  the  attraction  between  two  reflecting  surfaces  due  to  vacuum 

fluctuations  and  it  includes  the  retardation  effects  (light  propagation).  The  problem  of  two 

media  separated  by  vacuum,  can  be  viewed  as  a  generalized  vW  attraction.  Very  recently, 

precise  measurements  of  the  Casimir  attraction  have  appeared  (for  a  review  see  e.g. 

Lambrecht  and  Reynaud,  2003),  that  stimulate  new  developments  in  the  theory,  notably  

justifying  studies  at  various  distance  ranges,  or  consideration  of  material  dispersion  effects 

and thermal effects. 

An elementary situation for this interaction between two bodies is the restriction to the 

interaction  between  a  surface  and  a  single  atom.  The  theoretical  link  between  the  two 

problems  goes  through  the  approximation  of  an  infinitely  dilute  medium  (see  Barash  and 

Ginzburg,  1989).  One  experimental  advantage  is  the  variety  of  investigation  methods  that 

becomes available : among others, molecular beam technology, high resolution spectroscopy, 

laser cooled atoms, have been found appropriate for these studies. At the other end, the atom-

surface problem can be seen as an extrapolation, through an integration over the collection of 

atoms that is the essence of the dense media, of the atom-atom long-range interaction, known 

as the vW long-range tail of an interatomic potential (London, 1930 ; Lennard-Jones, 1932). 

More generally, the long-range atom-surface interaction is a topic of interest in its own 

right. "Long-range" here means that the atom is at such a distance from the surface -usually 

 1 nm-,  that  the  atom  does  not  feel  the  details  of  the  atomic  structure  at  the  surface  :  the 

physical surface can be simply approximated as a planar wall, and a 2D symmetry translation

is naturally introduced in the problem. This atom-wall interaction is an unvoidable feature in 

Cavity QED, a realm of Physics that has demonstrated the possibility of reversible exchanges 

of excitation between the cavity modes and the atom (see e.g. Haroche, 1992), or that permits 

such  spectacular  effects  as  the  enhancement/inhibition  of  the  atomic  spontaneous  emission 

with respect to the atom-surface distance (Kleppner, 1981; Heinzen et al., 1987). In addition, 

with  emerging  nanotechnologies  and  their  possibility  of  atom-by-atom  implantation  on  a 

substrate, the precise knowledge of the interaction governing an atom in its approach towards 

a  surface  has  become  an  essential  concern.  Similarly,  for  the  understanding  of  desorption 

processes,  it should be essential  to know how a departing atom evolves from the attractive 

trapping region to the free-space. 

The knowledge of the atomic structure, at least in the free-space, is usually extremely 

precise. This permits a detailed description of the atom-surface interaction provided the dense 

medium  itself  is  described  not  in  an  ideal  manner,  but  realistically  (dispersive  dielectric 

medium,  real  metal,  ...).    The  present  work  mostly  concentrates  on  the  interaction  of  an 

excited atom with a surface. This situation, although more specific, is of an obvious interest 

for  various  applications,  notably  nanochemistry,  and  is  susceptible  to  offer  a  variety  of 

behaviors. As will be shown, it provides also a deepened insight into the effect of a possible 

excitation of the surface itself.  

In addition to the energy-shift induced by the attractive potential exerted by the wall, 

one  predicts  for  excited  atoms  a  surface-induced  modification  of  the  atomic  lifetimes. 

Drexhage  and  coworkers  extensively  studied  this  problem  as  early  as  the  70’s,  in  the 
experimental situation of atomic species (Eu3+ notably) actually embedded in organic layers 

(Drexhage, 1974). An overall agreement was demonstrated between the experimental results 

and  the  theoretical  predictions,  that    were  actually  based  upon  a  model  of  isolated  atom 

evolving  freely  at  some  distance  from  a  surface.  The  extension  to  atom-surface  interaction 

naturally permits to explore  more singular and quantized systems than those available with 

embedded emitting species. 

 

Among these general topics, we have been involved from the early 90's in the problem 

of  the  near-field  interaction  between  an  excited  atom  and  a  surface,  with  experiments  most 

often  relying  on  dedicated  optical 

techniques.  The 

theoretical  developments  have 

encompassed  the    effects  of  a  dielectric  resonance,  anisotropy  in  the  interaction,  and  shape 

factor  for  interaction  with  microbodies  and  nanobodies.  This  review  first  summarizes  the 

essential relevant results of Cavity QED, notably in its connection with the non-retarded vW

interaction,  and  discusses  the  various  subtleties  that  often  make  the  electrostatic  approach 

oversimplified.  The  following  section  (section  3)  reviews  the  main  experimental  methods. 

The  emphasis  is  on  the  optical  methods,  mostly  relying  on  the  monitoring  of  the  reflected 

light at an interface, and on the transmission through a very thin vapor cell. This description 

offers the basis to the analysis, in section 4, of some of our essential experimental results : the 

spectroscopic approach allows one to observe the atomic behavior at a typical distance to the 

surface in the ~100 nm range. Before the final conclusion, the section 5 deals with the most 

recent  developments  (both  experimental  and  theoretical)  that  are  in  particular  oriented 

towards the interaction of atomic systems with on the one hand, micro-and nano- structures, 

and on the other hand with thermal excitation of the surface.

Long range atom-surface interaction: principles and near-field limit 

The  major  principles  that  govern  Cavity  QED  and  interaction  of  an  atom  with  a 

reflector,  notably  a  perfect  reflector,  have  been  extensively  studied  in  numerous  works, 

including  e.g.  the  review  by  Hinds  (1994).  The  aim  of  this  section  is  first  to  recall  major 

results  for  the  nonfamiliar  reader,  and  to  emphasize  theoretical  results  that  are  the  more 

specific to the experimental works reviewed in this paper. Hence, we mostly focus here on the 

near-field  limit  of  the  surface  interaction,  corresponding  to  the  vW  description,  and    then 

discuss  with  more  details  the  specific  case  of  an  interaction  with  a  real  reflecting  surface, 

describing the reflector as a dielectric medium instead of an ideal metal. 

2.1 Ground state atom and perfect reflector: from London-van der Waals interaction to the 

retarded Casimir-Polder limit 

An  elementary  approach  of  the  atom-surface  interaction  can  be  traced  back  to 

Lennard-Jones  (1932).  It  relies  on  the  idea  of  a  London-van  der  Waals  dipole-dipole 

r
interaction (London, 1930) between an electric dipole  d

, and its electrostatic image induced 

in a reflector (see Fig.1). The interaction potential is hence given by:

In  Eq.  (1),  z  is  the  dipole-to-surface  distance,    and  (dx  ,  dy  ,  dz)  the  components    of  the  

r
vectorial dipole  d

. Although an atom has in general a null permanent electric dipole (dipole 

quantum  operator  D,  with  <D(t)>  =  0)  ,  its  quantum  (quadratic)  fluctuations  cannot  be 
neglected  (<D²(t)> „

 0).  This  permits  to  extend  the  electrostatic  model,  taking  into  account 

the  instantaneous  correlated  fluctuations  induced  in  the  reflector.  One  finds  an  additional 

interaction potential HvW to be included in the atomic Hamiltonian:

Equation (2) shows that the energy shift of the ground state induced by the surface interaction 
is  always  negative,  -  i.e.  attraction-  and  is  governed  by  a  factor  <g‰ D²+Dz²‰ g>  (‰ g>  :  the 

ground  state  wavefunction).  Remarkably,  this  surface  interaction  potential  is  not  isotropic; 

however,  the  anisotropy  vanishes  in  the  common  situation  of  an  atom  featuring  a  spherical 

symmetry, as most of atom ground states.  

It  has  been  soon  predicted  by  Casimir  and  Polder  (1948),  in  a  work  parallel  to  the 

Casimir  study  (1948)  of  the  electromagnetic  interaction  between  two  metal  plates,  that  this 

-3z   behavior  is  not  compatible  at  long  distance  with  the  non  instantaneous  propagation  of 

light. Taking into account the retardation effects, they show that the actual behavior evolves 

continuously  from a 

-3z dependence (for zﬁ

 0) to an asymptotic 

-4z  (for z ﬁ

 ¥

), with a final 

coefficient becoming governed by the (isotropic) electric atomic polarizability. Experimental 

evidences  of  this  deviation  from 

-3z   behavior  to  the 

-4z   behavior  at  long  distance  have 

appeared  only  in  the  recent  years  (Sukenik  et  al.,  1993;  Landragin  et  al.,  1996;  Shimizu, 

2001; for a review, see Aspect and Dalibard, 2003).  

An  important  point  recognized  by  Casimir  and  Polder  (1948)  with  these  retardation 

effects is that the distance range in which the instantaneous (near-field) approximation -also 

called  electrostatic  interaction-  is  applicable  corresponds  to  distances  smaller  than  the 

(reduced) wavelength of the relevant quantum transitions (see Fig. 2). For a real atom, and in 

spite  of  the  many  transitions  that  can  couple  the  ground  state  to  excited  states,  there  are 

numerous situations for which a two-level approximation, limited to the ground state and the 

resonant level, is valid: it yields a simple estimate of the range for which the short distance 

approximation (i.e. instantaneous image) applies.

To describe the surface effects on an atom in an excited state, one needs to consider 

the  radiative  properties  of  the  atom  associated  to  spontaneous  emission.  This  comes  in 

addition to the quantum dipole fluctuations, that are similar in essence to those for a ground 

state. This spontaneous emission can be described as radiated by an atomic dipole oscillating 

at  the  transition  frequency  -or  as  a  sum  of  such  radiations,  if  various  decay  channnels  are 

opened-.  In  the  vicinity  of  a  reflector,  the  boundary  conditions  are  responsible  for  a  "self-

reaction"  correction  term  that  imposes  modifications  to  the  radiative  diagram  in  vacuum. 

Indeed,    the  oscillating  atomic  dipole  (object)  interferes  with  the  oscillating  dipole  image 

induced in the reflector, whose oscillation is now phased-delayed by propagation effects: this 

results in both a radiative energy shift, and a modified decay rate of the spontaneous emission.  

The vacuum wavelength of the electromagnetic oscillation provides a natural scaling 

factor to evaluate the distance range to the surface, sorting far-field and near-field effects (see 

Fig.2).  In  agreement  with  the  well-known  far-field    expansion  of  the  energy  radiated  by  an 

oscillating  dipole  (Hinds  and  Sandoghdar,  1991),  one  finds  for  an  excited  state  a  slowly 

damped  oscillating  behaviour,  evolving  asymptotically  as 

z -1 cos
 
(kz)

(k:  the  wavenumber 

associated  to  the  considered    radiative  process),  at  odds  with  the  Casimir-Polder  limit 

applicable to a ground state. This oscillatory radiative shift, although it remains tiny relatively 

to  the  inverse  of  the  spontaneous  emission  decay  time,  has  been  notably  observed    with  an 

atomic beam passing through the node or antinodes of an orthogonal Fabry-Perot (Heinzen et 

al.,  1987).  Conversely,  in  the  near-field  limit,  the  radiative  shift  is  dominated  by  a 

z -3 cos
 
(kz)

 term. In the electrostatic limit (kz << 1), on which we will mostly concentrate on,  

this contribution turns out  to be nothing else  than the 

 -3z

 vW shift mentioned above.  

2.3 vW surface shift and virtual transitions 

 

Before proceeding to the quantitative evaluation of the vW surface interaction, it may 

be of interest to note that a pure classical atom description, with an orbiting electron, already 

provides some modeling of the dipole atomic fluctuations. The more the orbiting electron is 

excited, the stronger are the fluctuations. As a result, optical spectroscopy can in principle be 
used to evidence an atom-surface interaction, with a z-3 red-shift in the near-field electrostatic 

approximation. This has provided the basis for numerous experiments, such as evoked in the 

following sections. Paradoxically, a pure quantum two-level model contradicts this prediction 

(Hinds and Sandoghdar, 1991), as, in this limited frame, the average dipole fluctuations are

the fundamental importance of considering virtual transitions in the evaluation of the  strength

that a pure two-level model is essentially unable to predict the strength of the vW interaction.

In  general,  the  prediction  for  the  C3  value  characterizing  the  vW  interaction  can  be 

rather accurate, the atom being in the ground state or in an excited state atom. This is because 

Atomic  Physics  has  developed  numerous  and  refined  tools  for  the  evaluation  of  atomic 

wavefunctions. However, a few remarks should be pointed out:  

(i) Oppositely to the spontaneous emission, which is negligible in the far infrared (IR) range, 

and  dominant  in  the  UV  part  of  the  spectrum,  the  C3  value  is  often  dominated  by  the 

contribution of dipole couplings associated to virtual (far) IR transitions (see e.g. Fig. 3 and 
Table  1).  This  is  due  to  the  l 3  dependence  appearing  in  the  dipole  coupling  for  a  given 

oscillator strength.

(ii)   In most cases, the C3 value grows with the atomic excitation level: this can be seen either 

from the increasing dipole fluctuations when the atomic excitation increases (comparable to a 

stronger  atomic  polarizability),  either  from  the  more  tightened  atomic  structure,  with  more 

numerous IR couplings, typical of levels close to ionization.   

(iii)  The  vW  Hamiltonian  HvW  is  nonscalar  in  its  essence,  with  a  quadrupole  term  Dz²  

susceptible to modify atomic symmetry. Such a modification becomes quite important when 

the vW interaction compares with the energy difference between levels, notably at very short 

distances  (see  section  5.1.3),  or  when  some  sublevel  degeneracy  is  removed  (e.g.  in  the 

presence  of  a  magnetic  field,  with  Zeeman  degeneracy  removed),  or  for  a  polarized  atomic 

system. However, for a statistical set of sublevels, sum rules enable  the vW interaction to be 

simply estimated with the knowledge of the dipole fluctuations associated to the radial part of 

the  wavefunction,  and  with  simple  angular rules (Chevrollier et al., 1992). Note that in the 

principle,  the  various  hyperfine  components  originating  from  the  same  level  do  not 

necessarily  undergo  an  identical  vW  interaction  potential,  owing  to  their  different  angular 

momentum.  However,  for  atomic  states  with  low  values  of  the  angular  orbital  momentum 

(e.g. S or P levels, that can be coupled only to S, P, D levels) the anisotropy effect remains 

relatively  small  (see  also  section  4.5).  More  generally,  as  long  as  the  magnetic  component 

remains  degenerate,  the  averaged  vW  shift  is  governed  by  the  scalar  vW  contribution  (that 

can be identified to the r.h.s. of Eq. (5b)), while the quadrupole contribution, that varies with 

the  magnetic  component,  is  essentially  susceptible  to  induce  an  hyperfine-dependent 

broadening (Papageorgiou, 1994).  

(iv)  In  the  summing  implied  by  Eq.  (5),    the  transitions  to  high-lying  state  and  to  auto-

ionizing  levels  are  very  numerous,  and  their  influence,  in  spite  of  their  unfavorable  short 

wavelength,  can  be  important,  notably  for  a  ground  state.  Derevianko  et  al.  (1999)  have 

estimated that for a Cs atom in its ground state, the transitions involving the external electron 

contribute  to  only  ~60  %  of  the  vW  interaction,  in  spite  of  the  alkali  nature  of  this  atom. 

Indeed,  a  large  part  of  the  C3  value  originates  in  transitions  involving  excitation  of  the 

electronic core. However, the near-field approximation is valid only in a very limited range 

for these contributions, located in the vacuum ultra-violet (VUV) range. Above the range of 

core  transition  wavelengths,  the  near-field  approximation  (vW  interaction)  still  stands, 

provided that the short wavelength couplings are neglected. Also, the core contribution does 

not vary much from one energy level to the other, and its contribution to spectral lines largely 

cancels.

material  can  be  expected  to  behave  as  an  ideal  reflector  on  the  whole  spectrum  of  interest. 

Rather, any real surface, including those made of noble metals, exhibits dispersive features, 

that can be dealt with when considering the general problem of an atom interacting  (in the 

near-field approximation) with a dielectric medium.  

In the frame of a pure electrostatic model, the induced image in a dielectric medium is 

simply reduced by an image coefficient r (0 < r < 1):

with  e   the  (real)  dielectric  permittivity  of  the  medium.  Actually,  the  static  value  of  the 

permittivity,  appearing  in  Eq.(6),  is  not  relevant  to  deal  with  the  real  properties  of  the 

reflector.  Indeed,  in  our  problem  of  atom-surface  vW  interaction,  the  temporal  dipole  

fluctuations have been introduced, and developed over a set of virtual transitions. 

Following Lifchitz work (1956) for the interaction between two dielectric solid bodies, 

the general response for a ground state atom interacting with a surface  has been approached 
in the 60's (Mavroyannis, 1963; Mac Lachlan, 1963 a, 1963 b). For each virtual transition ‰

In Eq. (7), e (iu) is the analytical extension to the complex plane of the frequency-dependent 

dielectric permittivity e (w

). Equation (7) shows that for a fluctuation, apparently sensitive to a 

transition frequency w

ij, the response efficiency is dependent upon the whole spectrum of the 

material.  Also,  it  can  be  shown  from  causality  reasons  (e.g.  from  the  Kramers-Krönig 
relation),  that  r(w

ij)  decreases  in  a  monotonic  way  with  increasing  w

ij.  This  implies,  in 

agreement  with  the  pure  electrostatic  model,  that  0 <  r(w

ij)  <  1.    Moreover,  far  away  from 

dielectric  resonances,  e (w

ij)  is  real  and  slowly  varying,  and  r(w

this  justifies  that  when  the  vW  interaction  depends  only  on  transitions  falling  into  the 

transparency  region  of  the  material,  the  image  coefficient  factor  is  approximated  by  r  = 

(n² - 1) / (n² + 1), with n the refractive index of the material in the transparency region.  

In  most  of  the  real  situations,  the  transparency  window  of  a  material  is  not  large 

enough  (relatively  to  the  width  of  the  absorption  bands),  so  that  the  influence  of  the 

neighboring absorption bands cannot be totally neglected. This brings some corrections to (n²-

1)/(n²+1). This has been illustrated in the course of our work (Failache et al, 2003): while for 
sapphire, a material transparent from 0.2µm to 5µm, the estimated value at l

 = 0.87 µm is r ~ 

0.49,  the simple (n²-1)/(n²+1) approximation yields r = 0.51 . 

When an excited state interacts with a dispersive reflector, the vW interaction can still 

 
be described by a set of dielectric reflection coefficients r(w

ij), but there is no longer such a 

restriction as 0 < r(w

ij)  < 1. From the Wylie and Sipe (1984 , 1985) approach, one gets indeed

 standing for 

"real part". While the first term in the r.h.s. of Eq.(8) behaves as the contribution in Eq. (7), 

with  an  averaging  over  the  whole  spectrum  of  the  material,  the  second  term  in  the  r.h.s.  of 
Eq.(8) appears only for a virtual emission (i.e. for w

ij < 0), and has no equivalent for a ground 

state atom. It is calculated at the precise virtual transition frequency, and it is susceptible to 

take any real value,  moreover without any sign restriction. The physics of this additional term 

relies  on  the  possible  resonant  coupling  between  the  virtual  atomic  emission,  and  a  virtual 

absorption  in  a  surface  mode.  The  surface  mode  resonances,  such  as  illustrated  in  Fig.4  for 
typical windows, are derived from the bulk resonances - governed by  e (w

) - , through a shape 

factor [(e  - 1) / (e +1)]. Note that the resonant surface response can possibly induce a change 

of the sign of the atom-surface interaction -leading to a vW repulsion, instead of the universal 

attraction-.  This  can  be  interpreted  in  the  following  way  :  instead  of  instantaneous  image 

fluctuations,  the  resonant  coupling  enables  giant  but  time-delayed  dipole  fluctuations  in  the 

dense  medium,  as  induced    by  the  atomic  fluctuations  in  the  range  of  the  virtual  transition 

frequency. Note that as will be discussed later on (section 5), the restriction (in Eq. (8)) to a 

virtual atomic emission is related to the standard assumption that the surface itself does not

bear excitation (i.e. the temperature is assumed to be T = 0). This is legitimate as long as far 

IR transitions can be neglected at room temperature.  

2.5 Near-field modification of the lifetime of an excited atom in front of a real surface 

The modifications of the lifetime induced in the vicinity of a reflector are also specific 

to the excited atom. For an ideal reflector, there appears, along with the  damped oscillatory 

behavior of the energy shift (see section 2.2), an enhancement/inhibition of the spontaneous 

emission close to surface, depending on the dipole orientation: in the limiting situation z = 0, 

a  dipole  parallel  to  the  wall    does  not  radiate,  because  the  induced  image  oscillates  with  a 

phase strictly opposite to the one of the dipole source, while the emission rate doubles for a 

dipole with a normal orientation. Such a behavior, easily derived from a classical model, has 

also been rigorously  justified in the frame of Quantum Mechanics (Courtois et al., 1996).  

In front of a "real" surface, the above interference effects are attenuated because the 

reflection  is  only  partial,  but  an  additional  damping  must  be  considered,  related  with  the 

opening  of  extra-decay  channels.  Indeed,  for  a  transparent  dielectric  medium,  and  as 

discussed  by  Lukoscz  and  Kunz  (1977  a),  the  excited  atom  can  lose  its  excitation  by  the 

emission, in an evanescent mode, of a photon, that has the ability to freely propagate in the 

transparent dielectric medium (see Fig. 5). This effect, associated to an atomic emission in the 

forbidden  region  outside  the  fluorescence cone, always enhances the atomic relaxation rate, 

but by an amount that remains finite, even very close to the interface. This amount depends on 

the dipole orientation and on the dielectric medium index, but it remains relatively small (e.g. 

the enhancement does not exceed a factor ~3 for an index n = 3, and for the optimal dipole 

orientation). Its variations with the distance to the surface, originating in the standard features 

of  evanescent  wave,  typically  span  over  the  relevant  wavelength.  The  extension  to  a 

multilevel  atom,  with  various  decay  channels,  is  straightforward  with  respect  to  the various 

wavelengths to be considered.  

When  the  wall  is  not  transparent  at  the  considered  emission  wavelength,  the 

absorption  prevents  those  extra-decay  channels  related  with  an  emission  propagating  in  the 

forbidden  cone.  However,  energy  can  be  transfered  from  the  excited  atom  to  the  surface 

modes  (e.m.  propagation  guided  along  the  surface).  This  near-field  coupling  to  a  surface 

mode  appears  to  be  the  dissipative  counterpart  of  the  vW  energy  shift.  It  is  governed  by  a 
surface  response  that    diverges  as  z-3  (Wylie  and  Sipe,  1985),  and  governed  by  a  factor

, whose variations for typical windows are illustrated in Fig.4. This 

divergence  establishes  the  possibility  of  dramatic  changes  in  the  relative  transition 

probabilities for an excited atom at a small distance from a wall (Failache et al., 2002). Also, 

the efficiency of this transfer depends on the line strength: as for the vW interaction, the long 

wavelength  transitions  located  in  the  far  IR,  where  the  spontaneous  emission  is  usually 

negligible, are usually dominant in this near-field process.  

2.6 Interaction of an atom with an anisotropic medium 

The  "long-range"  approximation,  as  discussed  in  section  1,  implies  that  the  atom 

interacts in a system offering a perfect plane symmetry, so that the interacting Hamiltonian is 

governed  by  a  cylindrical  symmetry.  Actually,  this  symmetry  can  disappear    if  the  medium 

itself  exhibits  some  anisotropy,  e.g.  if  the  interacting  surface  has  finite  dimensions  or  a 

spherical shape (see sections 5.3 and 5.4), or as discussed here, in the case of a birefringent 

medium.  Up  to  a  recent  work, performed in our group (Gorza et al., 2001) and involving a 

detailed treatment of the birefringent medium for an arbitrary orientation of the medium axis, 

this  problem  had  been  seldom  tackled  when  the  (quantized)  interacting  particle  is  an  atom. 

Several studies, that  had involved an interaction with liquid crystals, notably those of Kihara 

and Hondo (1965) and Bruch and Watanabe (1979), yield however  valuable hints for an atom 

in  the  ground  state  (see  also  the  work  of    Šarlah  and  Žumer,  2001).  As  a  general  result,  a 

major  modification  in  the  interaction  appears  in  the  interaction  Hamiltonian,  now described 

by such an expansion:

with usually a

. This introduces in the principle extra quadrupole effects in the interaction, 

with  the  additional  breaking  of  some  usual  symmetry  rules.  In  the  principle,  this  break  of 

symmetry  within  the  vicinity  of  the  surface  may  enable  previously  forbidden  transitions, 

analogous to those observed by Boustimi et al. (2001 c) and  Karam et al. (2002). 

Even for an atom with a low angular momentum, when the effects are restricted to the 

scalar part of the interaction, the medium anisotropy can still induce some sensitive effects, 

through  an  orientation-dependent  shift  of  the  resonant  properties.  Indeed,  the  dielectric 

properties of the medium are governed by two different permittivity coefficients (respectively 
the  permittivity  e

//  along  the  birefringence  axis,  and  e

^   orthogonal  to  this  axis),  whose

resonance  frequencies  are  not  equal.  Hence,  the  extrapolated  surface  resonances,  estimated 
from the surface response [(e -1) / (e +1)] are also different (Fichet et al., 1995; Gorza et al., 

2001;  Failache  et  al.,  2003).  Within  the  scalar  approach,  an  effective  dielectric  permittivity 
e eff  can  be  defined,  that  averages  the  permittivities  e

^ ,  with  a  geometrical  weighting 

//  and  e

dependent on the orientation of the birefringent axis relatively to the surface. As illustrated in 

Fig.6 , the atom-surface resonant coupling becomes tunable through an adequate choice of the 

c-axis orientation, and this may permit to tailor a giant and possibly repulsive vW interaction, 

or to impose a specific near-field quenching of the atomic excitation. 

 

3.  

Experimental approaches for the probing of atom-surface interaction 

Among the various experimental methods that have been used for the probing of atom-

surface  interaction,  one  may  distinguish  between  techniques  relying  on  mechanical  effects, 

and  methods  based  upon  optical  spectroscopy.  There  is  in  the principle no intrinsic limit to 

the  spatial  resolution  of  mechanical  methods,  while  the  optical  spectroscopy  methods  are 
commonly plagued by a limited spatial resolution (on the order of l /2p

 ~100 nm), that makes 

them non convenient to explore these smaller distances to the surface  (down to z ‡

 1 nm) for 

which  the  surface  interaction  is  described  as  "long-range".  On  the  other  hand,  mechanical 

methods are only well suited to long-lived levels (i.e. ground state, or Rydberg states), while 

high-resolution spectroscopy is very convenient to study short-lived excited states.   

3.1 Observation of the vW interaction through mechanical effects 

3.1.1 Thermal beam 

The first observation related with the vW atom-surface interaction can be traced back 

to the 60's, with the Columbia group (Raskin and Kusch, 1969) evidencing the deflection of a 

thermal beam of atomic Cs, at a grazing incidence with a metallic cylinder. It was followed by 

comparable  experiments  with  other  species,  including  molecules,  or  with dielectric surfaces 

(Shih et al.,1974; Shih, 1974). However, in these pioneering experiments, a large distribution 

of  impact parameters is involved, while only atoms flying very close to the surface undergo a 

notable  deflection.  These  measurements  (Shih  and  Parsegian,  1975),  affected  by    the 

uncertainty  on  the  quality  of  the  polishing  of  the  deviating  cylinder,  did  not  permit  a 

sophisticated inversion of the potential, such as discriminating between a 

-3z  vW potential, a

-4z  dependence (asymptotic limit of the Casimir-Polder expansion), and an hypothetical 

2z -

 

potential (e.g. for a charged surface). 

 

A  series  of  beautiful  experiments  was  completed  by  the  Yale  group  with  a  beam  of 

long-lived  Na  (and  Cs)  atoms  in  Rydberg  states  (Anderson  et  al.,  1988;  Sandoghdar  et  al., 

1992  and  1996):  essentially,  the  transmission  of  the  atomic  beam  is  measured  when  flying 

between two parallel surfaces, whose relative distance is adjustable. The high polarizability of 

Rydberg  levels  make  them  very  sensitive  to  the  vW  attraction.  The  transmission  methods 

provide a specific enhanced spatial resolution in the sense that only Rydberg atoms flying in a 

very narrow central zone, where the two vW attractions compensate, are susceptible to escape 

from  the  attraction  of  the  two  plates,  and  to  be  transmitted  and  finally  counted  through  an 

ionization  process.  This  favorable  transverse  velocity  selection  also  justifies  that  a  classical 
trajectory model reveals sufficient for the analysis. Precision measurement of the z-3 behavior 

of  the  atom-surface  interaction  was  achieved  (Sandoghdar  et  al.,  1992  and  1996)  by 

measuring the spectral shift of the excitation resonance to the Rydberg levels, for a beam of  

Na  atoms  having  entered  in  the  ground  state  in  the  channeling  zone.  The  quantitative 

comparison was performed for a plate separation ranging from 3 µm down to a 0.5 µm value, 

and for various (nS) Rydberg levels (n = 10 to n = 13). It was found to be in agreement with 

the theoretical predictions. These experiments were essentially conducted for interaction with 

metal-coated walls. Attempts to extend these experiments to dielectric surfaces (notably with 

uncoated  silica  blocks)  most  often  led  to  irreproducible  results,  with  respect  to  the  strong 

sensitivity of Rydberg levels to stray electric fields. Note that with slight modifications of the 

set-up, 

the 

long-distance  Casimir-Polder  behavior  (for  a  ground  state)  have  been 

demonstrated  (Sukenik  et  al.,  1993),  as  well  as  modifications  of  the  spontaneous  emission 

induced by thermal  effects on the wall (Lai and Hinds, 1998). 

It  is  only  very  recently  that  more  numerous  experiments  have  been  implemented, 

based upon a mechanical signature of the vW interaction. The technological development of 

nanogratings have enabled the Göttingen group (Grisenti et al., 1999) to observe the modified 

atomic  diffraction of a  rare gas beam -in its ground state and more recently in a metastable 

state (Brühl  et al., 2002)- in a transmission grating. The vW interaction reduces the effective 

opening  of  the  slits  and  induces  a  modification  of  the  diffraction  pattern,  conveniently 

observed as due to the high quality and reproducibility of the nanoslits involved in the grating 

(periodicity ~ 100 nm). Relatively to the experiments on Rydberg levels, the small size of the 

transmission  region  is  compensated  for  by  the  weaker  interaction  coefficient  for  a  ground

state.  Metastable  beam  transmission  in  slits  and  gratings  has  also  been  used  to  explore  the 

anisotropic part of the vW interaction (see section 5.3) 

 

 

3.1.2 Cold atoms 

The  recent  development  of  cold  atom  technology  has  opened  up  a  new  field  to  the 

study  of  atom-surface  interaction.  It  is  notably  motivated  by  the  fact  that  surface-induced 

effects,  like  decoherence,  can  be  responsible  for  major  limitations  in  the  trapping  and 

manipulation of cold atoms in integrated atom optics: in particular, at short distances, the vW 

attraction  may  be  strong  enough  to  attract  cold  atoms  towards  the  surface  and  to  accelerate  

them in a final phase of (surface) thermalization. However, the use of cold atoms for the study 

of  atom-surface  interaction  have  been  rather  restricted,  most  probably  because  of  the 

unfavorable duty cycle between the duration required to prepare a bullet of cold  atoms (on 

the order of seconds) and the short time actually spent close to the surface (at 1 µm from the 

surface, the velocity largely exceeds ~0.1m/s ,  even  for a cold sample prepared 1 mm above 

the surface). 

Anyhow, the Orsay group (Landragin et al., 1996) has succeeded in probing the long-

range atom-surface interaction, observing the free fall of a sample of cold atoms, down to the 

surface. They have provided one of the very few evidences of the retardation effects affecting 

the  interaction  with  the  ground  state.  Essentially,  the  attractive  long-range  potential  exerted 

onto a ground state is balanced with a controlled  additional repulsive potential as induced by 

a  (blue-detuned)  evanescent  wave.  The  resulting  bouncing  of  atomic  waves  -occuring  at  a 

distance estimated to be  47 nm- appears to obey to the Casmir-Polder expansion, rather than 
to the simple  vW attraction, valid only for z << l

 (see section 2.1). It is worth noting by the 

way that, in the fitting, the atomic interaction is theoretically evaluated only with the help of 

the  transitions  involving  the  external  electron,  while  neglecting    transitions  from  the  core 

(Derevianko et al., 1999). This is most probably justified (see section 2.3) by the distance of 

observation, that largely exceeds the wavelength (in the VUV range) of transitions from the 

core,  hence  inducing  a  strong  attenuation  through  the  retardation  effects;  in  addition,  the 

reflectivity of the dielectric surface is most probably very weak for the VUV range.  

Further possibilities to explore a closer range of distance with cold atoms seems now 

opened  with    the  recent  experimental  demonstration  of  quantum  reflection,  performed  by 

Shimizu (2001) with a beam of ultra-cold Ne* atoms flying nearly parallel to the wall.

20

 

 

3.2.1 Basic principle  

The basic principle of the Selective Reflection (SR ) spectroscopy was devised nearly 

a  century  ago  (Wood,  1909).  It  consists  in  the  monitoring  of  a  resonant  change  of  the 

reflection coefficient at an interface (see Fig.7). Indeed, when irradiating a resonant medium, 

like a vapor, at the interface with some transparent window, the resonant change of refractive 

index  induces  a  modification  of  the  reflection,  as  predicted  by  the  Fresnel  formulae.  Under 

normal incidence, the reflection coefficient R (in intensity) obeys :

Equation (11) shows that the SR lineshapes is governed by the dispersion (or refractive index) 

of  the  vapor,  and  is  independent  of  the  vapor  absorption  (within  the  first  order 

approximation). This is why SR spectroscopy has been used as a way to probe an optically 

opaque  vapor:  as  opposed  to  absorption  or  fluorescence  spectroscopy,  the  SR  signal, 

originating from the reflection at the interface, is insensitive to the cell length. As discussed 

below, the actual typical distance of observation is on the order of an optical wavelength; this 

point can appear somehow hindered by the assumption -as in Eq. (10)- of spatial homogeneity 

of the refractive index. 

In  a  microscopic  description  of  a  SR  experiment,  the  field  reflected  at  the  interface

In Eq.(12), we have conventionally assumed an optical phase such that 

0

rE  is real; also, for 

purposes of simplicity, all optical fields and oscillating dipoles are expressed in the rotating 

frame.  Note  that  in  more  complex  geometries  (such  as  a  multilayer  window,  possibly 
including  an  absorbing  layer  -e.g.  metallic  coating-),  D R(d )  may  become  proportional  to  a

predicted lineshapes (Chevrollier et al., 2001). 

In the calculation of the resonant reflected field 

, one has to sum up the field 

)δ(rED

radiated  by the atom dipoles, that are spatially distributed in the vapor. Hence, a phase factor 
exp(ikz)  (with  k  =  2p /l

  the  wave  number  of  the  incident  radiation)  has  to  be  taken  into 

account for the propagation of the incident field to the locally induced dipole p(z) (see Fig.7). 

A  similar  additional  phase  contribution  appears  for  the  coherent    summing-up  –  at  the 

interface z = 0 – of the backward radiated field. One gets:

(13) 

In  Eq.(13),  the  phase  modulation  factor  exp(2ikz),  analogous  to  a  mismatch  factor  in 

nonlinear  optics,  is  responsible  for  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  SR  method,  defining  a 
"coherence length" (e.g. l /4p ), on the order of  a reduced wavelength l

. This confirms 

 = l /2p

that,  when  the  medium  response  is  spatially  homogeneous  (i.e.  p(z)  =  p),  increasing  the 
length  L  (L>>l )  does  not  increase  the  reflected  field.    An  interesting  consequence  of  this 

short coherence length is that the SR signal can be dominant in the spatial regions where p(z) 
varies  sharply  (i.e.  on  a  l /4p

  scale).  This  is  the  reason  for  SR  to  appear  as  a  convenient 

method  for  probing  the  surface  interaction  :  in  an  homogeneous  medium,  only  the  vicinity 

with the surface is susceptible to induce rapid changes of p(z). Note at last that in Eq.(13), it 

has been essential to assume that the density of the resonant medium remains low enough, so 

that the propagation is unchanged by resonance (i.e. k remains real and identical to its value 

in vacuum). 

3.2.2 Atomic response and atomic motion 

3.2.2.1 The resonant atomic response 

For  a  vapor  of  motionless  atoms,  and  neglecting  the  surface  interaction  effects,  the 

induced dipole p(z) is usually derived from a simple linear resonant response such as:

(14) 

with g  the relaxation rate of the so-assumed Lorentzian resonance, and ip0 the dipole response 
at resonance; note that in Eq. (14), p0 is real, so that on resonance (d  = 0), the induced dipole 

oscillates in quadrature with the exciting field, and radiates a field whose phase is opposite to 

the one of the incident field, signing the absorption process. It is hence easily verified from 

Eqs.(12-14) that for a homogeneous semi-infinite vapor, the SR signal is purely governed by 

the dispersive response of the atomic dipole, justifying the elementary approach of Eq.(10).  

In the early descriptions of the SR spectroscopy, the effect of the atomic motion was 

simply  described  as  an  inhomogeneous  broadening  on  the  resonance  frequency,  with  the 
detuning d  replaced by a Doppler-shifted detuning, e.g. (d -kvz) with vz the normal velocity for 

SR under normal incidence. This approach predicts for the SR lineshape a Doppler-broadened 

dispersion (or more generally, a dispersive Voigt profile, see Fig.8). It is actually valid only 
when  the  Doppler  broadening  is  small  relatively  to  the  homogeneous  broadening  g .  Early 

high-resolution  experiments  performed  by  Cojan  (1954),  and  confirmed  in  the  laser 

spectroscopy era by Woerdman and Schuurmans (1975), have established that the lineshape is 

narrower than predicted by this approach. Indeed, the steady-state response given by Eq.(14) 

does not describe the response of atoms departing from the wall, which is a transient build-up 

response: as long as an atom is on the wall, its energy structure is considerably perturbed, and 

it  is  insensitive  to  the  nearly  resonant  excitation  of  the  incident  field.  At  least  two  notable 

consequences can be derived from this behavior: 

(i)  the  response  in  SR  spectroscopy  is  essentially  "nonlocal",  as  due  to  the  transient  effects 

and  to  the  atomic  motion    (Schuurmans,  1976).  Indeed,  the  atomic  response  of  a  given 

velocity group p(z,vz)  depends not only on the incident field E0(z), but also on the field E0(z') 

for all the z' values included in the (classical) trajectory explored before reaching z.  

(ii)  The  exp  (2ikz)  modulation  factor  tends  to  scramble  the  contribution  of  atoms  exploring 

many  wavelengths.  This  enhances  relatively  the  contribution  of  those  atoms  that  are  slow 
enough  (along  the  z-axis)  to  reach  their  steady-state  response  within    ~ l

    and  it  is  at  the 

origin of a sub-Doppler contribution in the SR lineshape at normal incidence. It shows also 

that  those  atoms  that  spend  a  long  time  interacting  with  the  surface  bring  an  important 

contribution to the SR signal. 

Note  that  in  spite  of  the  nonlocal  atomic  response,  the  evaluation  of  the  SR  signal 

derived from the Fresnel formulae (such as Eqs.(10-11) for the normal incidence) still stands,

provided that the local refractive index is replaced by an "effective index". This index relies 

on an "effective susceptibility" of the medium (Nienhuis et al., 1988), that spatially integrates 

all  of  the  atomic  response,  and  is  no  more  intrinsic  to  the  medium.  It  is  notably  dependent 

upon the angular orientation of the incident beam. 

3.2.2.2 The SR lineshape and the sub-Doppler logarithmic singularity 

The standard analysis of the SR lineshape -in the absence of surface interaction- was 

developed  by  Schuurmans  (1976).  It  is  valid  in  the  case  of  a  Doppler-broadened  two-level 

atom system in the regime of a linear field-atom interaction (i.e. saturation effects are to be 

neglected). It essentially integrates separately the contribution of the atoms arriving onto the 

surface, assumed to be in a steady state of interaction with the resonant light field, and of the 

atoms departing from the surface, experiencing a transient regime evaluated as a function of 
the elapsed time t  = z / vz since the departure from the wall. 

One  of  the  major  results  is  that,  simply  assuming  a  symmetric  velocity  distribution,  

these  two  separate  contributions  are  identical.  The  SR  lineshape  (see  Fig.8)  is  hence  the 

convolution of a two-level Lorentzian response with a half-Maxwellian (assuming a thermal 

velocity distribution). This coincidence between the two contributions, later shown to survive 

when a surface interaction is included in the model (Ducloy and Fichet, 1991), can be traced 

back  to  a  compensation  between  the  2kvz  Doppler  shift  between  the  two  velocity  groups  vz 

and -vz , and the phase factor exp (2ikz) typical of SR spectroscopy.  

An  important property of this convolution is that, due to the asymptotically slow vz

-1 
) of the dispersive Lorentzian in [(d -kvz)-ig /2]-1, the convergence of 

dependence (for vz ﬁ

 ¥

the velocity integration is ensured only thanks to the finite tails of the velocity distribution. 

This means that, for a given detuning, the SR response cannot be seen as originating in the 

contribution of a single "velocity group", as it is the usual case in absorption (i.e. in the "large 

Doppler width approximation", that cannot be used here for a dispersive lineshape). Rather,  

the (weighted) contribution of all atomic velocities has to be included. The abrupt singularity 

(vz=0) of the half-Maxwellian distribution is responsible for the specific narrow SR signal at 
line center (d  = 0) whose amplitude would diverge logarithmically if the Doppler width would 

be  asymptotically  large.  This  narrow  response,  evolving  like

3.2.2.3 The narrowing of SR lineshape with FM modulation 

This  remarkable  sub-Doppler  feature  of  SR  spectroscopy,    that  singles  out  the  vz=0 

contribution, has been turned into an efficient Doppler-free method when the Lebedev group 

(Akusl'shin  et  al.,1982)  recognized  that  the  SR  lineshape  yields  a  Doppler-free  signal  once 

frequency-derivated.  Technically,  such  a  derivation  is  conveniently  performed  with  a  FM 

(frequency-modulation) applied  to the incident field, and demodulation of the SR signal.  

The (FM) SR signal turns out to be a pure Doppler-free dispersive Lorentzian in the 

infinite  Doppler  width  approximation,  now  allowed  as  the  derivation  ensures  the  velocity 
 < g /2  )  corresponds  to

3.2.3 SR lineshapes in the presence of an atom-surface interaction potential 

3.2.3.1 The general case 

Under  the  assumption  of  a  linear  regime  of  atom-light  interaction,  and  solving  the 

problem of the nonlocal atomic response with the assumption of atomic linear trajectories at  

constant velocity, a formal calculation of the SR signal has been derived in the Ducloy and 
Fichet (1991) paper, that accounts for a z-dependent surface interaction potential [i.e. d  = d (z) 
0  the  z-dependent  resonance  frequency  of  the  atom,  and  w
frequency],  also  including  a  possible  z-dependent  transition  width  (i.e.  g   =  g   (z)).  The

calculation generally requires the evaluation of a triple integral, through (i) the averaging over 

the velocity distribution, (ii) the spatial averaging typical of the SR spectroscopy, and (iii) the 

spatio-temporal integration associated with the buildup of the oscillating atomic dipole.  

The  FM  technique,  shown  above  to  emphasize  the  contribution  of  slow  atoms,  is 

particularly  well-suited  to  the  study  of  atom-surface  interaction,  because  it  enhances  the 

contribution  of  those  atoms  interacting  for  a  long  time  with  the  surface.  Technically,  the 

velocity  integration  is  hence  replaced  by  the  sole  response  of  the  zero-velocity  group  -i.e. 

atoms slow enough to exhibit a null Doppler shift, although  the non local response, even for 

slow atoms, still demand a double spatial integration- . For this simplification, it is sufficient 

to assume that the Doppler broadening is large compared to both the homogeneous width, and 
the  surface  interaction,  as  evaluated  at  a  distance  ~  l

  (note  that  a  diverging  interaction  at 

small distances remains compatible with this reduction).

3.2.3.2 The specific case of the z-3 vW interaction 

The  double  integral  of  the  general  FM  SR  signal,  or  at  least  one  of  the  step  of 

integration,  can  sometimes  be  evaluated  analytically.  Apart  from  the  simple  case  of  an 

exponentially decaying potential –as induced by the dipole force associated to an additional 
evanescent  field-,    a  (vW  type)  z-3  potential  has  been  shown  (Ducloy  and  Fichet,  1991)  to 

enable such an analytical integration. Hence, a single numerical integration permits to obtain 

universal (dimensionless) FM SR lineshapes in the presence of a vW interaction  (see Fig.9 ). 

An  essential  point  is  that  under  the  simple  approximation  of  infinite  Doppler  width,  all 

features of these calculated lineshapes can be traced back to a single dimensionless parameter: 

(15) 
with C3 the coefficient of the z-3 shift. Note that in this spectroscopic approach, C3  has been

transition, 

i.e.  C3  = C3(‰

j >) - C3(‰

i >)  and 

0 - C3 z-3.  The  optical  width  is  here  assumed  to  be  constant  with  the  distance 

(g (z) = g ), i.e. it ignores the effect of a possible resonant transfer (see sections 2.5 and 4.4). 

 For low values of A ( 0 < A << 1), the vW interaction is essentially a perturbation that 

imposes a combined shift and distortion to the essentially dispersive Doppler-free lineshape. 

In  the  strong  vW  regime  (A>1),  the  lineshape  is  so  strongly  modified  that  one  cannot 

recognize  the  original  antisymmetry  predicted  for  FM  SR  with  A = 0.  Various  shapes  are 

obtained, evolving from a red-shifted absorption-like shape for moderate A values (e.g. in the 
A ~  1-10  range),  to  multiple  oscillations  on  the  red side (for A ‡

 100). The calculation can 

also  be  performed  for  A < 0  (Fichet  et  al.,  1995  b),  as  it  occurs  when  a  vW  repulsion  is 

exerted  onto  the  excited  state  (see  section    2.4)  or  if,  for  some  peculiar  reasons,  one  has 
C3(‰

i>). Remarkably, a red-shift of the SR lineshape is still predicted in this case, 

j>) <  C3(‰

although the local atomic resonance is shifted to the blue. This seemingly paradoxical result 

originates  in  the  particular  spatial  averaging  typical  of  SR  spectroscopy  (see  Chevrollier  et 

al., 1992, and notably  the appendix). On the other hand, in spite of their closely resembling 
lineshapes  in  the  perturbative  regime  ‰ A‰ <1,  red-shifting  (A > 0)  and  blue-shifting  (A < 0) 

vW  interactions  can  be  distinguished  by  their  amplitudes,  and  by  their  apparent  width  (see 

Failache et al., 2003).

The set of universal (FM) SR lineshapes that, as will be seen in section 4, provides the 

basis  for  a  large  part  of  our  experimental  investigations,  has  implied  several  current 

approximations.  It  is  worth  discussing  the  major  ones,  in  order  to  understand  how 

experimental constraints may lead to a possible violation of these approximations. 

3.2.4.1 Absorption  

 The validity of Eq.(13) assumes that there is no absorption, in particular because the 

exp (2ikz) factor assumes that in the resonant medium, the propagation does not differ from 

the  propagation  in  vacuum.  An  expansion  at  first  order  in  absorption  (or,  equivalently,  in 

atomic  density)  is  sometimes  tractable,  but  already  leads  to  the  blue  shift  first  predicted  by 

Schuurmans (1976). Note that the observation of the SR signal, essentially related to a probe 
region of extension ~ l

 , often occurs in experimental conditions for which the absorption is 

non negligible on a wavelength scale. This shows that, in the principle, extrapolation of the 

SR data to the limiting situation of a weak absorption is always needed. The problem hence 

becomes extremely complex, with local field (Lorentz field) corrections (Maki et al., 1991) to 

be  taken  into  account,  and  most  often  a  non-exponential  attenuation  of  the  irradiating  field 

(Vartanyan et al., 1995, see also Vartanyan and Weis, 2001). 

3.2.4.2 Symmetry of the velocity distribution  

The remarkable compensation appearing in the linear regime between the phase shift 

imposed by the transient response and the Doppler shift separating vz and -vz velocity groups, 

permits to calculate the SR lineshape with the sole contribution of the arriving atoms -or of 

the  departing  atoms-  provided  that  the  velocity  distribution  (over  vz  )  is  symmetric  (Ducloy 

and  Fichet,  1991).  Although  this  assumption  looks  reasonable,  it  may  be  not  satisfied  in 

various situations of experimental interest. For a gas sample submitted to an additional optical 

pumping,  the  atomic  polarization  -mostly  induced  on  the  arriving  atoms-    can  be  partly 

destroyed  through  a  collision  onto  the  wall,  leading  to  an  asymmetry  in  the  velocity 

distribution for a given atomic state. More generally, it is actually fascinating to note that, for 

a gas at equilibrium, the common idea of an isotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution may 

become  invalid  close  to  a  surface  (Comsa  and  David,  1985).  Indeed,  various  reasons  at  the 

microscopic  level,  including  the  structural  details  of  the  surface,  angular  properties  of 

desorption,  surface  roughness,  or  quantum  effects  on  the  atomic  trajectories,  may  actually 
contribute  to  invalidate  the  Lambert-type  "cos q

  "  angular  law  for  departing  atoms,  whose 

validity  has  been  seldom  tested  (see  however  Grischkowski,  1980;    Bordo  and  Rubahn, 

Atom-Wall Interaction

1999). Note that the selection of "slow" atoms, typical of the FM SR method, is moreover a 

way of testing the large angular values (i.e. trajectories at a grazing incidence with respect to 
 ~ p /2), usually out of reach for most of the mechanical methods. Let 
the window plane, or q

us mention that thanks to a relatively simple experiment of nonlinear selective reflection, the 

contribution  of  the  slow  atoms  was  measured    to  be  approximately  twice  smaller    for  the 

arriving    atoms,  than  for  the  departing  atoms  (Rabi  et  al.,  1994).  Unfortunately,  it  has  not 

been possible, through these measurements, to attribute unambiguously this effect to a surface 

specificity of the velocity distribution, rather than to a differential saturation effect.  

3.2.4.3 De-excitation at the arrival onto the surface 

The  SR  theory  assumes  that  arriving  atoms  get  de-excited  when  hitting  the  surface. 

Hence, the contribution of departing atoms is evaluated as a transient excitation, built-up from 
the  ground  state,  and  function  of  t  = z /vz   (with  t   the  time  elapsed  since  the  atom  has 

departed from the wall). Actually, it is conceivable that an atom, in a wall collision that would 
be  "instantaneous"  (i.e.  on  a    time  scale  ~10-12  s),  does  not  relax  all  of  its  internal  energy. 

However,  the  SR  spectroscopy  performs  a  kind  of  coherent  measurement,  sensitive  to  the 

oscillating  atomic  dipole,  rather  than  to  the  atomic  excitation.  Hence,  the  tremendous 

interaction  potential  exerted  by  the  surface  at  close  distance,  which  is  moreover  state-

dependent,  guarantees  (Ducloy,  1993)  that  the  prepared  coherent  superposition  of  states  is 

washed  out  in  a  surface  collision  process,  even  for  an  atom  that  could  remain  energetically 

 

 

excited in the collisional process. 

3.2.4.4 Finite Doppler width 

The FM SR is a genuine Doppler-free method only in the frame of the "large Doppler 
  ,  and  also  d  << ku.  In  a  realistic  case,  even  for 

approximation",  assuming  ku / g   ﬁ

 ¥

ku / g  = 100, and as due to the rather slow evolution of SR lineshape with the ku / g  factor (the 

"divergence"  being  only  logarithmic),  the  FM  SR  technique  does  not  yield  a  signal  totally 

independent  of  the  velocity  distribution,  and  some  corrections  must  be  applied  to  the  pure 

dispersive  Lorentzian  model  (Papageorgiou  et  al,  1994;  Failache,  2003).  In  standard  cases, 

these  corrections  affect  only  a  contribution  associated  with  the  tails  of  the  velocity 

distribution,  with  no  essential  effects  on  the  predictions  for  the  nearly  Doppler-free  SR 

resonance.

3.2.4.5 Normal and oblique incidence 

The sub-Doppler contribution, turned into a genuine Doppler-free signal for FM SR, 

has been predicted under the hypothesis of an irradiation at normal incidence. The narrowing 

occurs because of an identity between the "Doppler axis" (along which the velocity is counted 

for the estimate of the Doppler shift), and the normal axis, along which the transient  effects 

are evaluated. Under an oblique incidence, the FM SR Doppler-free lineshape is turned into a 
lineshape  sensitive  to  a  "residual"  Doppler  broadening,  on  the  order  of  kuq ,  with  q   the 

incidence angle of the irradiating beam in the vapor (Nienhuis et al., 1988; Oriá et al., 1991;  
Chevrollier et al., 1991 and 1992). This broadening is negligible as long as q   << g /ku. 

. 

3.2.4.6 Atomic trajectories:  Spectroscopy vs. mechanical effects  

The  essence  of  the  SR  lineshape  model  that  we  have  described  above  consists  in 

atomic trajectories traveled at a constant velocity. It neglects any possible curvature  imposed 

by  the  normal  force  exerted  by  the  atom-surface  potential.  Such  an  assumption  may  appear 

rather crude, especially with respect to the special contribution of the  slowest atoms, that are 

the most sensitive to the mechanical effects of the potential. We have attempted to enhance 

such a modification of the velocity distribution close to the wall by studying (Papageorgiou, 

1994  and  Papageorgiou  et  al.,  1995a)  the  influence  of  an  auxiliary  blue-detuned  repulsive 

evanescent wave on SR spectral lineshapes. However, the SR signal reveals sensitive not only 

to  these  possible  changes  in  the  atomic  velocity,  but  also  to  the  spectroscopic  effect  of  the 

potential (Ducloy et al., unpublished) 

To  discriminate  between  dominant    mechanical  or  spectroscopic  effects,  the  relative 

value  of  the  Doppler  shift  associated  to  the  potential-induced  velocity  change,  and  of  the 

spectroscopic shift imposed by the potential, can provide a rule of thumb. For a "typical" step 
of the potential D U (the "step" being distributed over a distance comparable with the spatial 

resolution ~ l

 , notwithstanding a possible divergence of the potential very close to the wall),  

the velocity change D v is given  by  : 

  

(v0 + D v)² - (v0)² = 2 D U/m 

 

 

 

 

 

(16) 

with  v0  the  initial  velocity,  and  m  the  atomic  mass.  In  the  FM  SR  approach,  the  typical 
selection  of  slow  atoms  is  a  restriction  to  velocities  ‰ vz‰
 g  / k.  With  a  specific  interest  to 
this upper boundary  v0 = g  / k, and assuming D v << v0 , one calculates from Eq. (16):

D v =  D U k/g m

According  to  our  criterion,  the  Doppler  shift  associated  to  the  mechanical  effect  dominates 
 D U. In our approach, this appears to be independent 
over the interaction potential if  h kD v ‡

 h k² ‡

(18 ) 

This  shows  that  for  our  typical  experiments  on  a  heavy  atom  like  Cs  at  l

  ~  1µm,  and  for 

rather  broad  resonance  lines  (g  ~ few  (2p ) MHz),  the  spectroscopic  effect  is  dominant. 

Conversely,  the  observation  of  the  mechanical  effects  would  demand  a  particularly  light  

atom,  along  with  a  very  narrow  optical  transition.  More  generally,  the  criterion  defined  by 

Eq.(18)  implies  that  the  mechanical  effect  dominates  only  when  the  selected  atomic 

momentum  mv0  is  smaller  than  the  recoil  effect  hk.  Such  a  condition  seems  at  odds  with 

uncertainty  principle:  it  shows  convincingly  that  the  mechanical  effects  of  the  potential 

should not be dealt with in the frame of classical mechanics. 

3.3 Nonlinear Selective Reflection 

The principle of probing an interface through SR spectroscopy can be extended from 

linear spectroscopy  (i.e. with a single incident beam, whose intensity is assumed to be weak  

enough to avoid saturation) to nonlinear spectroscopy, when the medium is sensitive either  to 

the saturation induced by the single irradiating beam, either irradiated with multiple beams. 

However,  it  should  be  recalled  that  one  essential  peculiarity  of  SR  spectroscopy  is  the 

logarithmic  enhancement  of  the  slowest  atoms  in  the  wall  frame  (and  the  genuine  velocity 

selection in the FM mode), and that this behavior is intimately connected to the linear atomic 

response. 

3.3.1 Saturation with a single irradiating beam 

Under a relatively strong resonant irradiation, in the same SR scheme as described in 

section  3.2.1,  saturation  of  the  optical  transition  can  appear  through  optical  pumping  of  the 

resonant  atoms  to  a  third  level.  The  onset  of  such  a  pumping  usually  requires  moderate 

intensities owing to the long relaxation time of the pumping (e.g. hyperfine optical pumping). 

For this reason, the arriving atoms - already in the steady-state - are much more sensitive to 

the  optical  pumping  effects  than  the  departing  atoms.  A  related  experimental  situation  has 

been analyzed by Vuletić et al. (1994): two different effective saturation intensities have been 

shown  to  appear,  that  were  attributed  to  the  different  behavior  of  arriving  and  departing 

atoms,  the  arriving  atoms  being  sensitive  to  saturation  with  an  allowed  hyperfine  optical

two-level system. 

3.3.2 Multiple beams nonlinear SR spectroscopy 

In  volume,  nonlinear  (NL)  spectroscopy    with  multiple  beams  irradiation,  such  as 

pump-probe spectroscopy, is a very efficient way to impose the selection of a given velocity 

group. Even with a system as simple as a three-level system, a large variety of schemes can be 
found (ladder scheme, cascade, L

-type, V-type,...). When one extends these techniques to NL 

SR spectroscopy at an interface, the variety of situations (see e.g. Schuller et al., 1991, 1993, 

1996)  is,  at  least,  as  large  because  propagation  from  the  window,  or  to  the  window  (with 

unavoidable  reflections)  generally  induce  different  behaviors.  In  addition,  the  overlap  of 

various incident beams, can sometimes generate extra  non phase-matched nonlinear emission 

from the bulk (Le Boiteux et al.¸1987; Amy-Klein et al., 1995; Sautenkov et al., 1997). 

A specific point of NL SR spectroscopy is that, while it is easy for the arriving atoms 

to interact with the pump excitation (at least in the large region where the surface interaction 

is  negligible),  more  complex  features  can  appear  in  the  pump  interaction  with  departing 

atoms,  owing  to  their  transient  behavior.  This  generally  means  that,  in  addition  to  narrow 

resonances associated to velocity groups arbitrarily selected by the NL excitation, as occuring 

in volume spectroscopy, one still predicts, in NL SR spectroscopy, a specific NL response of 

the  slow  atoms  yielding,  when  the  surface  interaction  is  neglected,  a  signal  centered  on  the 

probed transition (Rabi et al., 1994 ; Gorris-Neveux et al., 1995). 

Up  to  now,  the  atom-surface  interaction  has  been  neglected  in  most  of  the  specific 

theoretical approaches for NL SR. Indeed, the calculations are most often heavy (even in the 

lowest order limit, i.e. third order) because the transient behavior of a NL polarization should 

be  evaluated,  and  then  spatially  integrated.  Typically,  the  triple  integral  of  linear  SR 

mentioned in section 3.2.3 has to be replaced at least by a quintuple integral, with no obvious 

simplification. Another point worth mentioning is that the integrand of the NL SR response, 

equivalent  to  the  p(z) exp (2ikz)  term  appearing  in  Eq.(13),  include  various  spatial 

frequencies, as a consequence of the multiple beams NL excitation. This makes the depth of 

the  coherently  probed  region  difficult  to  estimate.  This  may  explain  why  no  surface 

interaction effect has been clearly identified in experiments based upon NL SR spectroscopy, 

even when the excited atomic levels are supposed to undergo a strong vW response (Gorris-

Neveux et al., 1995). However, when a strong spatial dispersion is induced (van Kampen et

al., 1998), notably when the pumped region is confined close to the interface (e.g. pumping 

with a confined or evanescent wave), some specific possibilities for the probing of the atom-

surface  interaction  may  exist.  Also,  the  possibility  of  selecting  an  arbitrary  velocity  group 

close  to  the  surface  may  provide  quantitative  indications  on  the  actual  velocity  distribution 

close  to  the  surface  (see  sub-section  3.2.4.2),    with  a  possible  differentiating  between  the 

slowly arriving and slowly departing atoms (Rabi et al., 1994). 

 

3.3.3 Pseudo-thermal pumping in an excited state 

A  convenient  situation  combines  the  linear  probing  on  a  transition  between  excited 

states, with the generation of an  artificial (quasi-) thermal population, as induced thanks to an 

auxiliary pumping scheme. It permits indeed to benefit from the well-understood  knowledge 

of linear SR spectroscopy, while reaching excited atomic levels by a stepwise process. Such a  

technique has been notably implemented in an experiment described in the section 4 (Failache 

et  al.,  1999  and  2003),  with  a  broadband  pumping,  in  an  off-axis  geometry  (i.e.  yielding 

Doppler-broadened  pumping).  Note  that  it  may  be  not  obvious  that  the  population  of 

departing and arriving atoms are equal very close to the surface, because the pumping of the 

departing atoms occurs in a transient regime of interaction.  

3.4 Evanescent wave spectroscopy 

The general technique of Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) consists of the coupling  

of an inhomogeneous field  to a resonant  medium : although an inhomogeneous field does 

not propagate energy, an energy transfer between the field and the medium can occur. This 

transfer  can  be  detected  on  a  propagating  field  coupled  to  the  inhomogeneous  one.  In  an 

elementary scheme, the evanescent wave (EW) spectroscopy  set-up (see Fig.10) consists of a 

traveling  wave  entering  into  a  prism  with  an  internal  incidence  angle  exceeding  the  critical 

angle  for  total  reflection:  no  traveling  field    emerges  out  in  the  vacuum  or  dilute  resonant 

medium.  On  resonance,  the  reflected  field  is  however  attenuated  (Carniglia  et  al.,  1972; 

Boissel  and  Kerhervé,  1981).  Analogous  ATR  observations  are  expected  when  the 

inhomogeneous  field  is the field  of a surface plasmon, provided in a geometry like the one 

proposed by Kretschmann and Raether (1968). 

Inhomogeneous fields are intrinsically confined close to the surface, with an amplitude 

exponentially  decaying  with  the  distance  to  the  surface.  In  the  principle,  this  makes  EW 

spectroscopy - and generalizations- a suitable technique for the probing of an atom interacting

with  the  surface.  An  essential  difference  with  SR  spectroscopy  at  an  interface  under  a  real 

incidence  angle  is  that  in  the  EW  technique,  the  incident  field  in  the  vapor  can  be  seen  as 

propagating under an imaginary incidence: hence, the EW technique is essentially sensitive to 

absorption processes, rather than to the dispersion (Simoneau et al., 1986).   

Another  difference  with  SR  spectroscopy  under  normal  incidence  appears  when 

atomic motion is considered : indeed, the Doppler shift in EW spectroscopy is counted along 

the velocity component parallel to the phase propagation (i.e. parallel to the interface) while 

the  transient  atomic  response,  intrinsic  to  the  spatial  inhomogeneity  of  the  EW  field,  is 

counted  with  the  motion  along  the  normal  to  the  window.  Hence,  while  in  regular  SR 

spectroscopy,  the  transient  behavior  of  the  atoms  helps  to  select  the  slowest  atoms,  EW 

spectroscopy  is  plagued  both  with  transit  time  thermal  broadening,  and  with  Doppler 

broadening.  

Extending  to  the  EW  techniques  the  well-known  volume  Doppler-free  saturated 

absorption,  we  had  developed  a  Doppler-free  EW  spectroscopy  (Simoneau  et  al.,  1986),  in 

which  the  pump  and  probe  fields  are  evanescent  fields  induced  with  light  beams  that 

counterpropagate in the prism. However, the finite time spent in the evanescent fields strongly 

alters the efficiency of the velocity selection, so that the optimal spectroscopic resolution is 

achieved    only  when  the  evanescent    fields    have  a  large  spatial  extension.  In  this  case, 

Doppler-free EW spectroscopy is only weakly sensitive to the region  where long-range atom-

surface  interaction  is  important,  limiting  applications  involving  the  monitoring  of  atom-

surface interaction. However, atomic residence time could be evaluated through a dephasing 

measurement in this EW technique (Bloch et al., 1990 ; Oriá et al., 1992; see also de Freitas 

et  al.,  2002),  establishing  a  possibility  of  probing  with  high  resolution  spectroscopy  a 

phenomenon related to the short-range atom-surface interaction. 

 

3.5  Spectroscopy in a thin vapor film: Micro- and Nano-cells 

The narrow spectral features characterizing SR spectroscopy under normal incidence 

are  not  that  much  typical  of  a  reflection  process,  but  associated  to  the  transient  regime  of 

interaction undergone by atoms located in the vicinity with the surface. Hence, an analogous 

enhancement  of  the  slow  atoms  contribution  is  expected  to  appear  in  transmission 

spectroscopy,  as  was  demonstrated  by  Briaudeau  et  al.  (1996,  1999  and  refs.  therein). 

Practically, such an effect is observable, under normal incidence, when the vapor cell is not 

too long -relatively to an average distance traveled by an atom before reaching a steady-state

of interaction-, and  when the vapor remains dilute enough so that the atoms fly from wall to 

wall.  This  last  condition  implies  that  the  atomic  "mean"  free  path  in  the  short  vapor  cell  is 

anisotropic, and justifies an overweight of atoms with small normal velocities (see Fig. 11)  

A major difference with SR spectroscopy is that, in transmission spectroscopy, there is 

no  more  the  oscillating  phase  factor  exp (2ikz)  factor  (see  Eq.(13)),  that  has  favored  the 

detection of atom-surface interaction through the enhanced contribution of regions where the 
atomic response varies rapidly over l

. Rather, the signal originates from the whole cell. This 

explains  why  the  first  demonstrations  of    these  novel  sub-Doppler  features  in  transmission 

spectroscopy, performed with micro-cells whose thickness spanned in the 10-1000 µm range, 

were unsensitive to atom-surface interaction. Conversely, and as will be discussed in section 5 

with  more  details,  the  recent  development  of  sub-micrometric  vapor  cells  ("nano-cells") 

(Sarkisyan et al., 2001) seems a promising tool to explore vW atom-surface interaction for a 

given range of distances to the surface, eventually much smaller than those currently  reached 

with SR spectroscopy (Dutier et al., 2004 a).  

  

4.  

SR spectroscopy as a diagnostics tool of the Atom-Surface interaction  

This section describes how SR spectroscopy has been used to measure the vW atom-

surface interaction. Starting from the most elementary observations, when the dielectric image 

coefficient  of  the  surface  can  be  considered  as  a  constant,  it  describes  how  an  effective 

measurement of the C3 value is performed, yielding a variety of information on the  atomic 

state  parameter  affecting  the  vW  interaction.  It  is  illustrated  with  some  of  the  effects 

associated with the resonant coupling between the atomic excitation and the surface modes. It 

ends up with a search for anisotropic effect in the vW interaction. 

4.1 Elementary observation of the vW interaction in linear SR spectroscopy 

4.1.1 Experimental set-up 

The  observation  of  a  SR  spectroscopy  signal  basically  requires  a  resonant  narrow-

linewidth  tunable  laser,  a  vapor  cell  enclosed  in  a  container  with  at  least  one  transparent 

window (wedged whenever possible), and a sensitive low-noise detector, in order to monitor 

conveniently  the  weak  resonant  change  in  the  reflection  coefficient,  relatively  to  a  non 

resonant reflected background on the order of  several percents of the incident intensity. An 

auxiliary  reference  set-up,  providing  a  signature  of  the  volume  resonance  such  as  obtained

34

with a saturated absorption (SA) set-up, is at least convenient to monitor the effect of the vW 

atom-surface interaction on the SR signal. Also, due to the higher resolution provided by the 

FM SR technique, a FM -of a small amplitude- is often applied, either to the irradiating beam 

with an external modulator, either to the laser itself, notably when a semi-conductor laser is 

used, for which it is easy to perform a FM with a modulation of the drive current. The FM SR 

signal is acquired after processing of the photodetector signal through a phase-sensitive lock-

in detection. Note that, relatively to an a posteriori frequency-derivation of the recorded SR 

lineshapes, the FM technique eliminates the d.c. noise (and low-frequency noise) of the laser 

4.1.2. Typical observation in linear SR 

In volume spectroscopy, the weakness of an absorption line is often compensated for 

by an increase in the absorption length, if not by a multi-pass scheme. In SR spectroscopy, the 

signal amplitude is typically comparable with the one expected for absorption on a depth as 
small as l

, and only an increase in the atomic density can enhance the signal magnitude above 

the sensitivity threshold. However, the atomic density cannot be increased too much because 

of the self-broadening of atomic lines, so that SR spectroscopy can hardly be applied to very 

weak lines - e.g. we are not aware of SR laser spectroscopy applied to molecular lines-. Also, 

discriminating  between  pressure  effects  -related  to  (volume)  atom-atom  collisions  -,  and 

surface effects is a major concern for most SR measurements. 

 

Nearly all experiments in SR laser spectroscopy have dealt with alkali vapors, whose 

atomic density varies quickly with temperature. We provide here some numerical indications 

for the Cs D2 line (852 nm), although the Na D2 line, the first one to be studied (Woerdman 

and Schuurmans, 1975), exhibits a comparable behavior, but for a smaller vW interaction. A 
density  on  the  order  of  ~1013 at/cm3  (i.e.  T~100°C  for  Cs)  allows  a  detectable  reflectivity 
change  on  the  order  of  10-4,  -the  precise  values  depend  on  the  considered  hyperfine 

components, and on the optical properties of the reflecting window - , while the pressure self-
broadening ( ~ 10-7 Hz/at.cm-3) remains negligible relatively to the natural width (~ 5 MHz) 

(see  Papageorgiou  et  al.,  1994  a).  On  the  SR  lineshapes,  one  recognizes  (see  Fig.12), 

superimposed to the Doppler-broadened dispersive wings, narrower peaks associated with the 

respective hyperfine components, that are hence partially resolved. In the FM mode and under 

normal  incidence,  one  observes  well-resolved  Doppler-free  resonances  that  are  close  to 

dispersive lineshapes but for a slight asymmetry, already noted by Akusl'shin et al. (1982). In 

Atom-Wall Interaction

35

addition, high-resolution spectra most often reveal a small red-shift relatively to a reference 

SA spectrum, but its physical origin had been ignored until our works. This shift, on the order 

of  2-3  MHz,  is  only  a  fraction  of  the  total  width  (most  often  in  the  10-30  MHz  range, 

depending upon the experimental conditions, and in excess of the 5 MHz natural width). As 

discussed  in the next subsection, this combined distorted dispersive lineshape, and apparent 

lineshift, can be traced back to the vW atom-surface interaction (Oriá et al., 1991; Chevrollier 

et  al.,  1992).  Conversely,  the  sole  observation  of  an  apparent  frequency  shift,  while 

neglecting the distortion, cannot permit to evaluate, even approximately, the vW interaction. 

 

At  higher  atomic  densities,  the  broadening  of  the  SR  lineshapes  on  resonance  lines 

goes  along  with  an  increased  (anti-)symmetry  of  the  dispersive  lineshape,  that  has  even 

provided particular opportunities for laser frequency stabilization purposes (Ito et al., 1991; 

Li  et  al.,  1998).  This  regime  of  density  can  provide  an  essential  set  of  data  to  analyze  the 

pressure  broadening  effects.  It  has  also  provide  a  way  to  study  the  Lorentz  correction 

associated with local field effects (Maki et al., 1991). For this high density regime, the vW 

interaction  can  be  taken  into  account  as  an  extra-correction  term  (Guo  et  al.,  1996:  Ping-

Wang et al., 1997). 

 

Observing transitions weaker than the strong resonance lines of alkali is also possible, 

although more difficult. One of the narrowest FM SR lines that we have once observed has 
been  recorded on the 791 nm intercombination line (1S0-3P1) of Ba, although the very high  

operating  temperature  -in  excess  of  700°C-  rapidly  destroyed  the  sapphire  window,  and 

imposed  a  notable  broadening  (~1-2  MHz)  to  a  very  narrow  natural  linewidth  (100  kHz) 

(Failache  et  al,  unpublished).  In  the  principle,  such  a  narrow  resonance  should  permit  to 

select particularly slow atoms, and could be favorable to observe mechanical effects induced 

by  the  atom-surface  interaction  potential  (see  section  3.2.4.6).  The  second  and  higher 

resonance  lines  of  alkali  vapor  exhibit  weaker  oscillator  strengths,  orders  of  magnitude  

smaller than the first resonance line: however, as discussed in section 2.3, the corresponding 

excited  levels  are  much  more  polarizable  and  more sensitive to the vW interaction than the 

first excited state. In spite of the rather high atomic density usually required for the SR signal 

to be observable, and its correlated pressure broadening, the SR and FM SR spectra clearly 

exhibit special features that are the signature of the vW interaction in the "strong" regime (see 

3.2.3.2.) (e.g. (FM) SR lines that are resembling a shifted absorption-lineshape, or an inverted 

dispersion,  ..).

4.2 The method of experimental measurement of the C3 coefficient 

4.2.1 

 Fitting method 

As discussed above (section 3.2.3.2), the FM SR lineshapes for a 1-photon transition 

much  narrower  than  the  Doppler  width  have  been  described  by  a  family  of  universal 

(dimensionless)  lineshapes  depending  upon  a  single-parameter  A  (see  Eq.(15),    and  Ducloy 

and Fichet, 1991). For an isolated narrow FM SR experimental resonance, it is not difficult to 

evaluate  if  a  given  value  of  the  A  parameter  (or  a  given  range  Am < A < An)  is  able  to 
describe the observed lineshape. From an experimental determination of the width g , that is a 
priori  dependent  on  the  A  value  (i.e.  g  = g (A)),  one  estimates  the  relevant  value  of  C3.  The 

search for an optimal fitting (Papageorgiou, 1994), performed with a least square fit method, 

involves homothetic factors between the experimental spectrum and the dimensionless model, 

and  offset  factors  to  locate  the  resonance  frequency.  Note  that  the  fitting  cannot  allow  a 

continuous change of the A parameter, with respect to the non-analytic dependence of the A-
lineshapes.  Rather,  the amount of the minimal error e (Ai), found when optimizing for each 

value of a set of  A1, ..., Ap parameters, provides a criterion to find the acceptable range of 

[Am,  An]  values,  easily  converted  into  a  range  of  acceptable  values  of    C3.  On  this  basis, 

extensive  improvements,  yielding  a  high  reliability  (see  Fig.13)  and  consistency,  have  been 

developed along the years. They are detailed in the work of Failache et al. (2003). 

4.2.2 Checking the consistency of a vW determination 

In various situations, it happens that for a given SR lineshape, the accuracy on the C3 

value  remains  low.  Aside  from  an  insufficient  sensitivity  in  the  recorded  spectra,  it  can 

happen, in the weak vW regime (A << 1), that a large range of A value seems acceptable for 
the lineshape, while the g  value remains essentially governed by the peak-to-peak width of the 

quasi-dispersive  lineshape.  Two  very  different  vW  regimes  can  also  exhibit  seemingly 

analogous lineshapes. This is why the determination of the C3 value is generally secured by a 

consistency  check,  comparing  the  lineshapes  obtained  under  various  pressure  conditions 

(Chevrollier  et  al.,  1991  and  1992;  Failache  et  al.,1999  and  2003).  Varying  in  a  controlled 
manner the g  value (e.g. by density broadening), leads to phenomenological changes for the 

SR  lineshapes,  that  become  very  remarkable  in  the  strong  vW  regime  (A >> 1).  In  spite  of  

the  observed  changes  induced  by  (volume)  atom-atom  interaction,  the  atom-surface 

interaction has to remain unchanged. Such a test, illustrated in Fig. 14,  is so sensitive that it 

has permitted to simultaneously evaluate the coefficients governing the vW interaction, and

37

the pressure shifts (Chevrollier et al., 1991 and 1992). It also provides an adequate citerion to 

choose between two very different evaluations of the A value (Failache, 1999; Failache et al., 

4.2.3.  Comparing  the  C3  experimental  values  with  the  theoretical  predictions  for  SR 

experiments at the interface with a non dispersive material  

With  the  above  fitting  techniques,  the  C3  value  for  a  given  atomic  transition  and 

material at the interface, has been determined with an uncertainty in a 10-30 % typical range. 

Note  that  this  uncertainty,  if  partly  statistical  and  noise  related,  also  originates  from  a 

systematic biasing appearing on the extrapolated values for C3 , when attempting to improve 

the  modeling  of  the  SR  lineshape.  Several  series  of  measurements  have  been  performed  on 
the Cs D2 line (6S1/2-6P3/2), that yielded C3 »

 2 kHz.µm3 at a fused quartz interface (Oriá et al., 

1991;  Chevrollier  et  al.,  1992  ;  Papageorgiou  et  al.,  1994  a).  With  respect  to  the  dielectric 

response coefficient of fused quartz (~ 0.35 for all the virtual transitions relevant for the vW 

interaction exerted onto the 6S1/2 and 6P3/2 levels), there is an agreement, on the order of 30%, 

between the (slighlty higher) experimental and the  predicted theoretical value (Chevrollier et 

al., 1992 ). Note also that the C3 contribution of the excited state 6P3/2 is about twice larger 

than the one of the ground state 6S1/2 (with C3 = C3(6P1/2) - C3(6S1/2)). Comparable values are 

predicted  for  other  resonance  lines  of  alkali  vapors,  that  are  roughly  confirmed  by  the 

experimental results, notably on the D1 line of Cs, and on the D lines of Rb (see e.g. Gorris-

Neveux et al., 1997; Ping-Wang et al., 1997). 

For the weaker transition to the more excited Cs(7P3/2) level (reached with the second 

resonance  line,  l

 = 455 nm),  the  evaluation  of  the  C3  value  has  required  the  removal  of  the 

pressure shift effects. It was been found to be an order of magnitude larger (Chevrollier et al., 

1991  and  1992)  than  for  the  D2  line.  This  C3  value  originates  essentially  from  the  vW 

interaction exerted onto the excited level Cs(7P3/2). Although not performed systematically, a 

comparison  between  SR  spectroscopy  with  a  fused  quartz  window,  and  with  a  sapphire 

window, has evidenced a stronger interaction of the Cs(7P3/2) atoms with sapphire, as can be 
expected  from  a  comparison  of    the  [(e  - 1) /  (e  +  1)]  factor.  The  systematic  experimental 

evaluation of the C3 value yielded also a reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction, 

although this one is also found  slightly below (~30 %) (note that the early given experimental 

error bar  ~  15  % did not account for some possible systematic errors). Note that the relevant 

Atom-Wall Interaction

virtual transitions for the Cs(7P3/2) lie in the far IR region, and that even in the absence of a 

resonant coupling of the atom excitation with a surface mode, the theoretical evaluation of the 

dielectric  image  coefficient  may  require  slight  re-evaluation  relatively  to  the  early  and 

simplified estimates. 

Recent  preliminary  experiments  on  the  even  weaker  transition  to  the  more  excited 

Cs(8P3/2) level via the third resonance line of Cs  at l

 = 388 nm (Dutier  et al., 2004 a; Hamdi 

et  al.,  2004),  shows  that,  with  a  refined  fitting  method,  a  10  %  accuracy  level  on  the  C3 

determination is feasible on this line, hence requiring a careful control of the frequency scan. 

4.3  Observation  of  the  resonant  long-range  coupling  between  a  surface  mode  and  an 

 

excited atomic level 

4.3.1.  Predicting a resonant atom-surface  coupling  

As  already  mentioned  after  Eq.(8),  a  strong  enhancement  (positive  or  negative)  of  a 

given virtual emission contribution to the C3 value can occur for some materials, as the values

  are  not  limited  (see  Fig.  4).  These  resonances  for  this  enhanced 

contribution are predicted to occur for the complex frequency poles of  [e (

ijω )+1]. For such 

poles,  the  material  is  no  more  an  optical  "window",  but  is  extremely  absorbing  (absorption 

typically occurs on one wavelength), while the resonance sharpness strongly depends on the 

refractive  index  in  this  spectral  region.  Practically,  the  evaluation  of  the  surface  dielectric 

response r(

ijω ) is extrapolated from tabulated data for e (

ijω )  (see e.g. Palik et al., 1985), or 

from a fitting analytical model for e ., based upon a 3- or 4- parameters model for each bulk 

resonance.  However,  the  uncertainty  induced  by  this  extrapolation  can  be  notable  in  the 

resonance  regions.  Moreover,  there  remains  some  uncertainties  about  the  precise  resonant 

behavior, as due to possible differences (dopants or impurities, temperature, ...) between the 

actual window, and the samples used in the literature 

 

To  illustrate  the  possibility  of  a  resonance  in  the  vW  interaction,  we  have  notably 

concentrated on the virtual coupling between Cs(6D) and Cs(7P) : our first demonstration of a 

strong vW regime in SR spectroscopy, achieved on Cs (7P), had relied indeed on the strong 

coupling to Cs (6D) (virtual absorption falling in the 12-15 µm range). Sapphire, whose main 

bulk  absorption  resonances  are  located  at  ~15µm  and  ~20  µm,  exhibits  an  isolated  strong 

surface  resonance  (surface-polariton)  across  the  12  µm  region  with a quality factor Q ~100

  exhibits  a  dispersion-like  frequency  response,  while  the 

,  that  governs  the  surface-induced  atomic 

level transfer (section 2.5, and below, 4.4) exhibits an absorption-like dependence. Note also 

that  the  exact  position  of  these  resonances  depends  on  the  sapphire  birefringence  axis 

orientation  (see  Gorza  et  al.,  2001,  and  Fig.6).  With  a  c-axis  perpendicular  to  the  window 
), the vW contribution to the shift associated to the 12.15 µm emission Cs(6D3/2ﬁ 7P1/2) is 
(c^

predicted  to be enhanced by a factor ~ -15 relatively to an ideal reflector. This contribution, 
that would contribute to ~ + 7 kHz.µm3 over a total of 25 kHz.µm3 for Cs(6D3/2) in front of an 
ideal  reflector,  induces  a  strong  vW  repulsion  in  front  of  a  c^

  sapphire  window,  that 

dominates over all other and non resonant contributions (see Table 1). It stands indeed for ~ -
108  kHz.µm3  in  a  total  predicted  value  of    ~ -96  kHz.µm3  (see  Failache  et  al.,  2003).  For 

sapphire  with  a  c-axis  parallel  to  the  window  (c//),  there  is  no  more  a  strong  repulsion, 

because the atomic resonance falls close to the center of the region of anomalous dispersion 

for

: moreover, the detailed prediction (i.e. weak repulsion, or weak 

attraction)  is highly sensitive to the sapphire resonance modeling.  

 

The  above  predicted  resonance  behavior, 

that  has 

led 

to 

the  experimental 

demonstration  of  vW  repulsion  (Failache  et  al.,  1999  and  2003),  relies  on  a  specific 
coincidence  between  Cs(6D3/2ﬁ 7P1/2)  and  c^

  sapphire  surface  resonance.  Actually  such  a 

coincidence  is  not  so  unusual.  Indeed,  for  a  high-lying  excited  atom,  the  most  important 

virtual  transitions  (for  the  vW  interaction)  falls  in  the  relatively  far  IR  range,  while 

transparency  of  the  window  is  required    in  an  energy  range  which  is  governed  by  a  high 
atomic excitation. Moreover, the low quality factor of the surface resonance - i.e.  Q £
 100, 
relatively to the Q ~ 108 for atomic transition- makes it easy to find an atomic transition lying 

in the repulsive dispersive wing of a resonance. Such a standard material as YAG illustrates 

(see Fig.4) how easy it is to obtain a resonant behavior in the vW atom-surface interaction. It 

exhibits indeed numerous resonances in the 10-20 µm region in spite of a transparency region 

spanning    from  the  UV  to  ~  5  µm.  This  justifies  that  YAG  also  has  been  found  to  be  

repulsive  for Cs(6D3/2)  (Failache et al., 2003).

The  measurement  of  the  vW  surface  interaction,  even  in  the  presence  of  a  resonant 

coupling  between  the  atom  excitation  and  a  surface  polariton  mode,  is  not  intrinsically 

different from those measurements performed through SR spectroscopy from the ground state. 

However,  the  need  to  reach  high-lying  atomic  states  may  require  a  multi-photon  excitation. 

With  respect  to  difficulties  in  the  interpretations  of  NL  SR  spectra,  -for  which  the  surface 

interaction  has  never    been  included  in  the  theoretical  modeling,  see  section  3.3.2.  -,  the 

experiments  have  rather  relied  on  a  stepwise  quasi-thermal  pumping  of  the  resonant  level, 

followed by linear SR spectroscopy between the resonant level and the high-lying state. 

 

The  production  of  a  quasi-thermal  population  in  the  resonant  level  requires  a  strong 

pumping and high atomic densities. This has  made crucial an independent measurement of 

the  collisional  effect  (broadening  and  shift)  and  provides  some  extra-difficulties  in  the 

evaluation  of the "quasi-thermal" distribution. In spite of these difficulties, we could compare 

the  material  influence  on  the  vW  shift  for  several  atomic  systems  (notably  Cs(6D3/2), 

Cs(9S1/2),  Rb(6D))  that  are  sensitive  to  a  resonance  with  a  surface  mode  (Failache  1999, 

Failache  et  al,  2003).  The  experimental  accuracy  can  be  on  the  order  of  30 %.  These 

experimental determinations themselves are in agreement with the theoretical modeling. Note 

that the hypotheses of a linear atomic trajectories still holds  for all the regions significantly 
contributing to the SR spectrum : for Cs(6D3/2) atoms with vz = 30 ms-1 , located in front of a 

c^  sapphire window. the classical turning point is indeed located at z ~ 10 nm, a position that 

would imply a tremendous vW shift ~100 GHz. 

4.4 Förster-like energy transfer induced by the near-field coupling to the surface 

The  resonant  near-field  atom-surface  coupling  affects  not  only  the  energy  of  atomic 

states through virtual processes, but it can induce a real change in the internal state, induced 

by the vicinity with the surface. In this energy transfer with a surface, that can be seen as the 

analogous  of  the  Förster  internal  energy  transfer  between  two  distant  molecules,  an  excited 

atom located in evanescent tail of a surface polariton mode, loses energy through a near-field 

transfer  to  the  surface  polariton.  As  already  discussed  in  section  2.5,  such  an  effect  is 

governed by the same 

-3z law as the vW effect, and implies that the branching ratios of the 

excited state are strongly dependent on the distance to the surface. It dramatically affects the 

behavior of an atom in a high-lying state on its route towards a surface. Moreover, noting that 

resonant  behaviors  are  actually  quite  common  for  highly  excited  atoms  (see  section  4.3.2), 

Atom-Wall Interaction

such a surface-induced energy-level transfer can appear as nearly universal, with the strength 

of  the  resonance  essentially  governing  the  distance  from  the  surface  at  which  this  remote 

process  occurs.  Note  that  an  analogous  internal  energy  transfer,  but  induced  with  surface 

plasmon  modes,  had  been  discussed  for  embedded  "atomic"  species  (namely,  electronically 

excited molecules), but its efficiency was limited to a much shorter distance range, owing to 

the  ultraviolet  nature  of  the  considered  resonances  (see  e.g.  the  review  by  Chance  et  al., 

1978). 

 

The experimental demonstration of such a resonant transfer has remained qualitative, 

and  was  conducted  with  a  comparison  of  different  materials,  at  a  distance  to  the  surface  

controlled  by  the  spatial  resolution  of  a  SR  spectroscopy  method.  A  SR  spectroscopy 
experiment was conducted on the Cs 7P1/2ﬁ 10D3/2 transition (l

 = 1.298 µm), in the presence 

of  a  strong  (stepwise)  two-photon  pumping  to  Cs(6D3/2).  This  transition  is  normally 

transparent, because the relevant levels are unpopulated, but by the surface-induced transfer 

from  Cs(6D3/2)  to  Cs(7P1/2)  (the  spontaneous  emission,  falling  at  12.15  µm,  yielding  a 

negligible  contribution).  The  experiments  (Failache  et  al.,  2002)  evidenced    a  strong 

difference  between  a  (nonresonant)  fused  quartz  window  (no  SR  signal),  and  the  resonant 

situation provided with a sapphire window (c//)  or a YAG window (observable SR signal). 
The  surface-induced  transfer  has  been  estimated  to  occur  for  z  £

 450 nm  for  sapphire  and 

z £

 300 nm  for  YAG,  and  z £

 30 nm  for  fused  quartz.  The  spatial  resolution  of  the  SR 

diagnostics explains the observed differences. Such a difference is best seen for rather low Cs 

pressure, because at higher densities, energy-pooling collisions can compete with the surface-

induced process, and induce a Cs (7P1/2) population in the vapor volume.

Due to a sum rule, it has been shown (Chevrollier et al., 1992) that the value of the 

j, F'>) coefficient for the scalar part of the vW interaction should be the same 
 F' components as long as the degenerate ‰ F, mF> levels are identically populated. 

Conversely, if the individual  Zeeman components are resolved, non negligible differences in 

the strength of the vW interaction are predicted. 

 

We  have  attempted  to  observe  these  differences,  performing  measurements  in  the 

regime of intermediate magnetic field (Papageorgiou, 1994 ; Ducloy, 1994; Papageorgiou et 

al.,  1995  b),  with  the  Zeeman  degeneracy  removed.  To  escape  from  the  difficulty  of

these measurements, we have implemented a differential measurement, comparing the surface 

effect when the magnetic field that imposes the Zeeman structure is parallel, or perpendicular, 

to the surface. The experimental approach (Fig. 15)  used a cubic cell, with two perpendicular 

windows being irradiated in identical conditions (the irradiated spots being very close to each 

other, for the spatial homogeneity of the Zeeman effect). In these experiments, performed on 

the  well-known  Cs  D2  line,  reproducible  differences,  of  the  predicted  order  of  magnitude, 

were  observed  but  with    details  that  were  not  in  agreement  with  the  vW  non  scalar 

calculations. One possible interpretation of these discrepancies has relied on the simultaneous 

modifications of the radiative properties of an excited atom in front of a surface (see section 

2.5), that could affect locally the optical width of the transitions, and hence subtly modify the 

lineshapes.  These  modifications,  ignored  in  the  vW  modeling,  are  also  anisotropic,  with  a 

strong dependence on the relative orientation of the emitting dipole (Lukoscz and Kunz, 1977 

5.   

New developments and prospects9 

Among  the  various  prospects  that  we  present  in  this  section,  some  are  natural 

extensions of the works with optical techniques presented in sections 3 and 4. They include,  

extension  from  SR  spectroscopy  to  nanocell  spectroscopy,  and  the  effects  of  a  non-zero 

temperature environment. New directions, well-suited to study the atom interaction in a range 

of very small distance to the surface, are also presently explored, including the deflection of 

atomic  beam  with  nanoslits  technology,  and  the  interaction  of  atoms  with  strongly  curved 

surfaces, such as are nanobodies. 

5.1 Towards the exploration of strong confinement to the surface through spectroscopy in a 

   

nanocell 

5.1.1  Present technology and thickness measurement 

It recently became possible (Sarkisyan et al., 2001) to fabricate Extremely Thin vapor 

Cells  (ETC)  compatible  with  vacuum  sealing  and  heating,  so  that  an  alkali  vapor,  of  a 

controllable atomic density, can be  studied when imprisoned in a container whose thickness 

can  be  as  small  as  ~20  nm.  In  the  present  state-of-the-art,  two  thick  transparent  windows, 

carefully  polished  with  an  excellent  planeity,  are  contacted  to  a  ring-shaped  spacer  (typical

43

thickness  ~  300  nm),  and  glued  at  a  high  temperature  (mineral  gluing).  The  external 

atmospheric pressure induces a curvature on the windows, and usually the local cell thickness 

varies smoothly from near contact in the central region,  to ~ 1 µm in the peripheral regions. 

The  challenging  point  of  the  construction  is  that  the  cell  can  resist,  with  negligible 

deformations, to a strong heating (up to 350°C), enabling variations  of the atomic density on 

a  large  range.  Alternately,  for  a  construction  with  thinner  windows,  inserting  the  ETC  in  a 

vacuum  chamber  (Sarkisyan  et  al.,  2003)  provides  an  adjustable  local  spacing,  through  the 

control of the environmental pressure (between 0 and 1 atm). 

 

The parallelism of the two windows is intrinsically excellent (typical window diameter 

~ 20 mm), implying a Fabry-Perot behavior, at least for the two internal windows. On the one 

hand, this provides a convenient interferometric method to estimate the local cell thickness -

with an accuracy currently reaching 5 nm -, on the other hand, a spectroscopic signal in such a 

cell  is  not  the  simple  signal  associated  with  transmission  -or,  in  alternate  schemes,  with 

selective reflection- of a traveling wave: rather, it is a systematic combination of absorption 

and reflection signals (Dutier et al., 2003 b). 

5.1.2 Observation of surface induced effects 

When comparing the spectra obtained for various local thickness of the ETC, notable 

lineshapes differences are predicted, even in the absence of a surface interaction, as due to the 

Fabry-Perot behavior, which mixes up transmission and reflection response: depending on the 

thickness,  the observed lineshapes appear shifted, and with a variable asymmetry (Dutier et 

al., 2003 a). However, on the Cs resonance line, one has observed notable red shifts and well-

characterized  lineshape  distortions  for  a  thickness  typically  below  100 nm  (Dutier,  2003; 

Dutier et al., 2004 a, b, and Dutier, in preparation). This behavior, easily observed with the 

FM technique (see Fig. 16), can no longer be traced back to the mixture of dispersive wings 

and  absorption-like  lineshapes.  The  frequency  shift  increases  quickly  with  decreasing  the 
thickness  -roughly  like  1/L3  (L,  cell  thickness)-,  while  the  observed  lineshapes  have  been 

found  in  good  agreement  with  predictions  that  include  the  estimated  vW  interaction  (as 

estimated from theory or from  previous SR experiments). 

 

From  a  more  systematic  comparison  between  the  experimental  lineshapes,  and  the 

family of theoretical models for various strengths of the vW interaction, it should be possible 

to measure effectively the vW interaction, as it was done with SR experiments (section 4.2). 

Hence, with the spatial resolution intrinsically offered by such nanocells, it should be possible 

Atom-Wall Interaction   

Bloch and Ducloy 

March 23, 2004 

44

 

 

 

to test the law of spatial dependence in 
the SR technique, that always averages over ~l

-3z  of the vW interaction more effectively than with 

 . Note that here, the effective vW potential 

results from an interaction with multiple electric images. Also, for each ETC thickness, a full 

set of C3-dependent  lineshapes has to be calculated. 

Experiments with nanocells have also been performed on more excited levels, such as 

Cs (6D) level, either after a pumping on the D1 or D2 line, either in two-photon schemes. We 

have already evidenced, after a nearly homogeneous pumping on the D2 line, the very  large 

vW attraction (several 10's of GHz) exerted onto the Cs (6D5/2) level for small thickness  in 

the  20-50 nm  range  i.e.  for  an  atom-wall  distance  remaining  always  below  25  nm.  These 

observations  remain  however  very  preliminary  because  unwanted  effects,  such  as  dynamic 

Stark shifts, are often present, as the experimental  conditions often require intense beams for 

the  signal  not  to  be  too  small.  Also,  for  these  distances,  surface  roughness  of  the  windows 

could be an issue. 

5.1.3 Possibility of a level crossing induced by a surface resonance 
Extrapolating  at  much  shorter  distances  the  C3(‰

 

i>) z-3  behavior  asymptotically 

demonstrated for long distances, opens in the principle the possibility of an ‰
crossing as long as C3(‰

j>) . This can be illustrated with Cs (6D) and sapphire (see 

j>  level 

i> - ‰

 C3(‰

i>) „

Fig.  17).    The  fine  structure  sublevels  of  (6D3/2)  and  (6D5/2)  are  predicted  to  behave 
differently in front of  a sapphire surface: the (6D3/2)ﬁ

 (7P1/2) virtual emission at 12.15 µm 

falls  in  a  resonance  of  the  surface  modes  of  sapphire,  inducing  a repulsive behavior (for c^  
sapphire),  while  the  6D5/2ﬁ

  7P3/2  virtual  emission  at  14.6 µm  is  non  resonant,  and  lets 

unchanged the regular and relatively weak vW attraction (see Fig.4). With the knowledge of 

the  respective  C3  values  (associated  to  the  asymptotic 

-3z  behavior at z ﬁ

 ¥

) for Cs(6D3/2) 

and  Cs(6D5/2),  a  level  crossing  is  hence  expected  for  a  distance  to  the  wall  z ~ 5 nm.  This 

estimated  distance  is  only  marginally  modified  (Dutier,  2003)  if  one  takes  into  account  the 

local  modifications  affecting  the  wavelength  of  the  relevant  resonant  virtual  emissions,  as 

induced  by  the  vW  shift.  Conversely,  the  energy  where  this  level  crossing  occurs  is  highly 

sensitive to the local details of the vW potential. 

Looking  for  a  signature  of  such  a  level-crossing  -which  could  turn  to  be  an  anti-

crossing,  depending  on  the  non  diagonal  term  of  the  vW  interaction  Hamiltonian-,  we  have 

started to investigate an anomaly in the wings of the spectral lines reaching (in the free-space) 

the Cs(6D3/2) and Cs(6D5/2) levels. For such a purpose, spectroscopy in an ETC seems to offer

45

 

 

 

 

 

much  wider  possibilities  than  SR  or  evanescent  wave  spectroscopy,  as  due  to  a  spatial 

resolution  limited  only  by  the  cell  construction.  The  observation  of  such  effects  have  been 

attempted,  with  the  help of a widely tunable laser source (Yarovitski et al., in preparation), 

operating    across  the  whole  fine  structure  (~ 1 THz)  of  Cs(6D)  from  the  resonant  Cs(6P3/2) 

level. However, for the shortest cell thickness, the vicinity between the two walls, and their 

imperfections  at  short  distances,  may  modify  the  conditions  ensuring  a  resonant  coupling 

between atom excitation and the surface modes.  

5.1.4 Atom-atom interaction in a tightly confined medium 

A  significant  observation  of  the  atom-surface  interaction  in  a  vapor  requires  to 

eliminate the effects of atom-atom interaction, such as pressure broadenings and shifts. These 

collisional  effects  themselves  may  depend  on  the  cell  thickness,  a  parameter  that  can  be 

conveniently  varied  in  ETC  spectroscopy.  Let  us  recall  that  the  long-range  atom-atom 

interaction,  that  scales  like 

  (r  :  the  interatomic  distance),  and  whose  integration  over  a 

-6r

half-space  leads  to  the  atom-surface  vW  interaction  (see  section  1),    can  be  viewed  as  a 

reaction  of  an  atom  to  the  field  induced  by  its  own  e.m.  fluctuations  as  mediated  by  the 

perturber atom. It has been predicted that this interaction should be affected by confinement 

in  a  cavity,    when  the  dimensions  of  the  cavity  are  smaller  than    -or  comparable  to-  the 

relevant wavelengths of the dipole fluctuations (Cho and Silbey, 1996; Cho, 1999; Boström et 

al., 2002). Indeed, the fluctuating dipole field can interact with the perturber atom following 

various propagation paths that include reflection onto the confining surfaces. Until now, these 

theoretical  predictions  had  remained  untested,  because  there  was  no  available  experimental 

methods  to  explore  such  a  collisional  regime.  It  seems  also  that  these  predictions  have 

remained  limited  to  the  elementary  situation  of  two  atoms  located  at  fixed  positions,  not 

providing an estimate of  the overall effect resulting from an integration over a distribution of 

positions and velocities. Clearly, these atom-atom interactions that are mediated by a surface 

should be considered in various devices such as atom chips, and their detailed understanding 

will require a sufficient knowledge of the more elementary "atom-surface" interaction. 

5.2 Thermal effects 

 In  numerous  cases,  the  temperature  of  the  surface  remains  small  enough  so  that  the 

thermal energy kBT (with kB the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature) is much smaller 

than the involved energy of the relevant atomic transitions. However, high-lying energy levels 

Atom-Wall Interaction   

Bloch and Ducloy 

March 23, 2004 

46

 

 

are usually connected to neighboring levels that are not very distant in energy, and as already 

noted  in  section  2.3,  the  far  IR  couplings  easily  become  dominant  as  soon  as  the  vW 
interaction is concerned. Hence, the T ﬁ

 0 approximation may break down. 

A beautiful demonstration of a kind of  "spontaneous absorption" of a thermal photon 

has been given in the Lai and Hinds work (1998), when the decay time from Cs (13S) appears 

increased  as  due  to  an  excitation  channel  to  Cs  (14P)  through  a  thermal  absorption.  This 

process, allowed in the free-space at a non-zero temperature, has been shown to be forbidden 

when  the  experiment  is  performed  in  too  a  narrow  cavity,  when  its  size  is  smaller  than  a  

wavelength cutoff. Alternately, the thermal field in the vicinity of a surface has been shown to 

exhibit  unexpected  coherence  properties  (see  Greffet  et  al.,  2002  and  references  therein), 

along  with  a  spectral  dependence  that  is  governed  by  the  near-field  properties  of  the 

blackbody emitter. 

Although  it  is  clear  that  the  atom-surface  vW  interaction  can  be  affected  when  the 

energy  of  the  involved  virtual  atomic  transitions  falls  in  the  range  of thermal photons, only 

few theoretical works (see  e.g. Barton, 1997; see also Henkel and Wilkens, 1999) had dealt 

with  this  problem.  Very  recently,  the  theory  suitable  for  SR-type  observation  has  been 

developed  in  our  group  (Gorza,  2004,  in  preparation,  and  Hamdi  et  al.,  2004).  One  major 

result  is  that  the  resonant  coupling  between  atom  and  surface,  that  was  limited  to  an  atom 

virtually  emitting  into  a  surface  mode,  can  now  be  extended  to  the  symmetric  process  in  

which  the  (hot)  surface  virtually  emits  a  photon  subsequently  absorbed  by  the  atom.  The 

efficiency  of  this  resonant  process  naturally  depends  on  the  thermal  population  factor 
{ exp (hw

ij/ kBT) ]}.  This  surface-emitting  process  exhibits  a  notable 

ij/ kBT) / [1 + exp (hw

change  of  the  sign,  relatively  to  the  atom-emitting  process  considered  in  Eq.  (8):  to  the 
observed repulsion of Cs(6D3/2) in front of (c^

) sapphire -associated to the (6D3/2) ﬁ

(7P1/2)  

12.15 µm  emission-  ,  should  correspond  an  enhanced  attraction  for  Cs(7P1/2)  when  the 

temperature is high enough, i.e. on the order of ~ 1000 K. In addition to the thermal effect on 

the  resonant  coupling,  involving  thermal  population  of  surface  modes,  the  non  resonant 

contribution, such as the one appearing in Eq. (7) and featuring an integration over the whole 
spectrum,  is replaced by a discrete summing over the Matsubara frequencies w

 = kT / 2p

 h. 

Note  that  in  the  principle,  the  introduction  of  these  thermal  excitations  introduces  new 

characteristic  wavelengths,  above  which  the  near-field  expansion  may  become  invalid.  In 

spite of this, an elementary 

-3z  interaction remains most often valid, yielding a C3(‰

i>) value 

simply  dependent  on  the  temperature,  i.e.  C3(T).  The  changes  induced  by  this  non  resonant 

Atom-Wall Interaction   

Bloch and Ducloy 

March 23, 2004 

47

 

 

 

 

contribution seem to remain marginal, while the resonant contributions (including those only 

associated to wings of  a resonance), are predicted to be dominant. 

Experimentally,  it  does  not  seem  that  these  C3(T)  variations  have  ever  been 

investigated at present. Our SR studies on the 8P3/2 level of  Cs are oriented in view of such 
an  investigation.  Indeed,  the  strong  absorption  couplings  (8P3/2)ﬁ

  (7D3/2)  and  (8P3/2)ﬁ

 

(7D5/2) occur respectively at 39 µm and 36 µm, i.e. an energy corresponding to the practical 

temperatures used in SR spectroscopy.  With windows in materials such as BaF2 or CaF2 (see 

Failache  1999,  and  Fig.18)  resonant  effect  in  the  atom-surface  interaction  may  appear  with  

temperature,  with  the  vW  attraction  possibly  turned  into  repulsion  for  a  sufficient  window 

thermal  excitation.  These  predictions  assume 

that 

the  surface  modes  are  known 

phenomenologically, and that temperature variations on these modes can be neglected, at least 

for a given range of temperature.  In the principle, the real problem is more intricate, because 

the thermal equilibrium of the bulk material depends itself on its equilibrium at the interface 

with  vacuum.  However,  the  narrowness  of  atomic  resonances  should  selectively  filter  these 

broad  couplings to vacuum. 

5.3 vW anisotropy and surface-induced inelastic transfer in an atomic beam 

5.3.1 vW interaction and Metastability transfer 

The  intrinsic  anisotropy  of  the  surface  vW  interaction,  originating  in  the  quadrupole 
2, can lead to a variety of diagonal interaction for the various Zeeman components, 

term in Dz

as it has been searched for in the experiments described in section 4.5. The anisotropy of the 

interaction,  with  its  non  diagonal  contribution,  is  also  susceptible  to  break  down  well-
established  selection  rules  and  enables  surface-induced  D J = 2  transitions.  This  has  led  to  a 

search  for  an  inelastic  transfer  between  the  two  metastable  atomic  states  of  rare  gases 

(Ducloy, 1998;  Boustimi et al., 2001 a), respectively characterized by the quantum numbers 

J = 0 and J = 2.  

Due to the large amount of energy involved in such an inelastic process, governed by 

the same 

-3z scaling factor, the metastability transfer occurs only at extremely small distances 

from the wall (that may fall below the "long-range approximation", see section 1). Owing to 

the long lifetime of metastable atoms, the experimental principle can rely on the mechanical 

deflection  of    an  atomic  beam,  enabling  one  to  compare  the  free  atom  before  the  vW 

interaction, and the output channels for the atoms having undergone such a surface interaction

(see  Fig.  19).  A  key  point  in  the  detection  method  is  that  the  change  in  the  internal  energy 

transfer is totally converted into kinetic energy, i.e. there is no energy transfer to the surface; 

moreover,  the  vW  interaction  being  invariant  along  the  surface,  the  atom  acquires  an 
impulsion transfer D

D p that is oriented along the surface normal.

energy  transfer,  combined  with  the  well  defined  direction  for  D

For  a  monokinetic  incident  beam  of  metastable  atoms,  the  extreme  accuracy  of  the 
D p,  imposes  that  the  atoms 

having  undergone  a  change  of  internal  state  contribute  to  produce  a  novel  atomic  beam, 

monokinetic and whose angular direction relatively to the incident beam  is rigorously known.

In eqs.(19-20), vo and vf are respectively the initial and final atomic velocities, and q o and q

As the energy transfer most often largely exceeds the thermal energy of the atoms (e.g. 

up to 650 meV for Kr, as compared to ~ 70 meV for the velocity-selected thermal energy), the 

angular deflection is very large (e.g. 70°), with the weak dispersion around this value yielding 

information  on  the  effective  state  of  the  surface  (e.g.  lack  of  planeity  as  due  to  local 

corrugation, breakdown at a microscopic level of the local long-range symmetry,...).  

Experimentally, atoms cannot fly at a grazing incidence over a long distance because 

the  interaction  is  attractive.  Rather,  the  beam  is  deflected  after  transmission  through  a  thin 

microslit. Experimental difficulties are many: the counting rates are very low, as due to the 

low density of metastable states; the impact parameter enabling an atom to undergo deflection 

is very limited : the typical distance where the metastability transfer is efficient is found to be 

~ 5 nm. The shape of the microslit must be well controlled for the interaction to occur during 

the ~ 100 nm long region where the atom is at grazing incidence. Anyhow, the strong angular 

selectivity of the process has permitted to observe this signature of vW anisotropy in various 

situations. The successful observation for metastable  Ar and Kr atoms transmitted through a 

micro-slit  (Boustimi  et  al.,  2001  a)  was  followed  by  a  more  efficient  process  associated  to 

transmission through a nano-grating (Boustimi et al., 2001 b), by an extension to a molecular

specie (metastable N2) (Boustimi et al., 2001 c), and even by the observation of the reverse 

endothermic metastability transfer (Karam et al., 2002). 

5.4 Atom interaction with nanobodies 

With  the  trend  to  explore  shorter  and  shorter  atom-to-surface  distances  -see  sections 

5.1 and 5.3-, it becomes notably interesting to consider the interaction of atom with surface 

featuring "strong" curvatures, i.e. a curvature radius smaller than the relevant wavelengths for 

the atom fluctuations. 

Several  modifications  have  to  be  considered  for  the  interaction  of  atoms  with  the 

nonplanar surfaces (see e.g. the review by Klimov et al., 2001): 

-  The  geometrical  factor  that  controls  the  strength  of  the  electrostatic  image  from  the  bulk 
permittivity e  departs from the common factor [(e  - 1) / (e  + 1)]. It is described in general by a 

more  complex  function,  that  can  occasionally  be  turned  into  the  well-known  form  factor 
[(e  - 1) / (e  + 2)] for an atom located in the vicinity of a sphere (Klimov  et al., 1996; 1997a, 

b;1999  a,  b)  .  In  particular,  the  cylindrical  limits  of  ellipsoids  have  been  considered  in  this 

problem,  with  a  study  of  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  corresponding  geometrical  factors 

(Klimov and Ducloy, 2000) 

- This change in the surface response implies a  frequency shift in the resonant response of the 

nanobody  -relatively  to  the  planar  surface  response-  ,  when  the  dielectric  medium  is 

dispersive.  

a,b). 

-  The 

-3z   interaction  law  remains  valid  as  long  as  the  atom-surface  distance  is  small 

compared to the curvature of the nanobody. More generally, the cylindrical symmetry of the 

interaction  can  be  lost,  and  extra-anisotropy  term  naturally  appears  from  the  particular 

geometry  of  the  interacting  atom  with  a  specially-shaped  nanobody  (Klimov    et  al.,  2002, 

-  When  the  curvature  radius  becomes  shorter  than  the  propagation  wavelength,  the  atom-

surface  interaction  is  no  more  limited  to  a  dipole  expansion,  coupling  the  atom  dipole 

fluctuations  to  its  induced  image.  Rather,  the  complete  multipole  expansion  should  be 

considered. This permits the quadrupole contribution to bring specific resonant contributions, 

that could turned to be dominant in specific cases (Klimov and Ducloy, 2000).  

-  A  larger  variety  of  situations  than  the  elementary  discrimination  between  attractive  and 

repulsive behaviors can even be considered. In particular, there could exist a possibility  for

an atom to orbit around a nanobody (Klimov et  al., 1999 b). Specific effects associated with 

the periodicity of a photonic device are also under investigation. 

Until  now,  the  corresponding  theoretical  developments  have  not  been  followed  by 

demonstration experiments, notably because of the lack of a general experimental method for 

these  problems  with  nanobodies,  that  would  be  the  equivalent  of  SR    spectroscopy  for  the 

interaction  of  an  atom  with  a  plane  surface.  Note  that  the  experimental  developments,  in 

progress in Paris (Treussart et al., 1994; von Klitzing et al., 2001) and in Cal'tech (Vernooy et 

al., 1998) have until now been more concerned with microbodies (notably microspheres with 

their  specific  resonances)  whose  size  largely  exceeds  the  wavelength,  than  with  genuine 

nanobodies.  For  a  single  nanobody,  the  surrounding  volume  is  very  small,  and  the 

experimental  extension  to  a  distribution  of  "identical"  nanobodies  requires  homogeneity 

conditions that are particularly tough to realize with the present state-of-the-art of nanobody 

production. Also, the atomic motion strongly limits the interaction time.  The use of very slow 

atoms  (i.e.  after  laser  cooling)  could  be  beneficial,  in  spite  of  the  already  mentioned 

limitations, and eventually with respect to the quantum nature of the atomic motion and limits 

due to uncertainty principle at a very small distance from the nanobody. More generally, the 

resonances of an atom at a very small distance from the surface gets so broad, and the lifetime 

of  its  excited  level    (Klimov  et    al.,  2001)  so  short,  that  the  advantages  of  high  resolution 

spectroscopy tends to be limited. Rather, the general formalism developed for such a problem 

can be applied to an elementary "atomic" system, such as a chromophore, in a more general 

situation than the one of  an atom freely evolving in the space. In particular, these modelings 

may  be  of  interest  for  various  problems  such  as  the  modification  of  the  fluorescence  

spectrum of an embedded atom (or  ion) close to a nanoscope tip (Klimov et  al., 2002 b), or a 

carbone nanotube, or nanofibers (Klimov and Ducloy, 2004)... 

 

Further extensions should deal with the interaction of an atom with a micro- or nano- 

structured  object,  such  as  microstructured  fibre,  nano-grating,  ...,  introducing  the possibility 

of  tailored  shape  factor  as  well  as  nanobody-driven  response,  extended  over  a  macroscopic 

size.  Let us also recall  that the sensitivity is enhanced when a transmission slit is replaced by 

a transmission nano-grating in the experiment described in the above section with metastable 

atoms. It would hence become conceivable that details on the quality of the structured surface 

are learned from the observed features of the surface interaction.

Conclusion 

Atom-Wall Interaction

The  problem  of  the  long-range  electromagnetic  coupling,  between  an  atom  and  a 

neighboring  surface  exhibits  many  facets  that  the  optical  methods  are  well  suited  to  tackle, 

notably because they provide a natural technique to explore the variety of situations offered 

by  excited  atoms.  Although  the  principle  description  of  the  vW  surface  interaction  is 

apparently  well-known,  the  effective  experimental  exploration  has  remained  limited,  with 

respect  to  the  extremely  broad  range  of  energy  covered  by  the 

-3z   interaction.  The 

development  of  new  techniques,  enabling  complementary  exploration  of  various  distance 

ranges, is hence an important purpose of a fundamental interest, that is partly connected with 

contemporary  quantitative  researches  on  the  Casimir  effect.  Our  studies  have  notably 

emphasized  the  importance  of  the  spectral  response  of  the  surface,  and  are  potentially 

sensitive to the various corrections such as anisotropy, lifetime and trajectories modifications, 

temperature corrections, and surface roughness, that invalidate too elementary predictions. In 

the  same  spirit,  it  should  be  noted  that  although  the  related  problem  of  the  vW  interaction 

between two solids is of utmost importance for various problems of biology, like membrane 

problems,  the  various  estimates  derived  from  simple  models  have  until  now  revealed  too 

crude  to  describe  sensitively  the  experimental  biological  values  (Boström  et  al.,  2001). 

Similarly, one may expect that the understanding of the resonant energy transfer mechanism 

between  molecules  (see  e.g.:  Cohen  and  Mukamel,  2003;  Selvin,  2000)  could  benefit  in  a 

fundamental manner from the various observations performed with an atom and a surface, or 

with gaseous atoms in a confined environment.

Cs(6D5/2) - in grey -. The strength of the couplings, as estimated for an ideal reflector,  -see 

Table 1- is made visible by the variable thickness of the coupling arrows.

for fused silica, and from Gledhill et al. (1991) for YAG. 

Figure 5 : Emission in the "forbidden region": when an atomic emitter of the vapor is close 

enough to the interface, emission in the near-field yields observable fluorescence outside the 

fluorescence cone defined by  sin(q cr) = 1/n. 

Figure 6 : Tunability of the dielectric image coefficient r (see Eq.(8)) with the orientation of 

the c-axis. The figure illustrates the situation for a sapphire window interacting with an atom 

whose virtual emission, at 12.15 µm, is in resonance with the surface modes. q

 is the angle 

between  the  c-axis  and  the  normal  to  the  window.  The  atomic  state  itself  is  assumed  to  be 

isotropic.

Figure  7  :  The  principle  of  Selective  Reflection  (SR)  spectroscopy  is  the  detection  of  a 

resonant change  (i.e. when the irradiating frequency w

 is close to the vapor resonance at w

0) 

D R(w

)  in  the  field  reflected  at  the  window  interface.  This  change  originates  in  the  field 

radiated,  for  each  "slice"  of  the  medium,  by  the  oscillating  dipole  p(z)  induced  by  the 

irradiating field. 

Figure 8 : The theoretical SR lineshape, in the local model (dispersive Voigt profile, in dashed 

line),  and  in  the  nonlocal  model  (solid  line).  The  horizontal  frequency  scale  is  in  Doppler 

width (ku) units, the homogeneous width  is 0.01 times the Doppler width. 

Figure  9  :  Theoretical  frequecy-modulated  (FM)  SR  lineshapes  taking  into  account  the 

strength  of  the  vW  interaction  through  the  dimensionless  A  parameter  (see  Eq.  15).  The 

calculation is "universal", as due to the infinite Doppler width approximation. 

Figure 10 : The principle set-up for evanescent wave spectroscopy. 

Figure  11  :    Spectroscopy  in  a  thin  cell:  for  a  given  modulus  of  the  velocity  (e.g.  most 

probable thermal velocity), longer atomic trajectories and a longer interaction time with the 

laser light are allowed for atoms with a small velocity along the normal to the windows (i.e. 

small v^

 ). Note that the laser beam diameter is assumed to exceed largely the cell thickness

Figure 13  : An example of the fitting (narrow black line) of a FM SR lineshape (in grey). The 

fitting  includes  here  3  different  hyperfine  components,  and  is  performed  with  a  single 

parameter  for  the  vW  strength  parameter  (and  a  single  homogenous  optical  width).  It  also 

takes  into  account  the  frequencies  of  the  unshifted  (free-space) resonance, as revealed from 

the  Saturated  Absorption  (SA)  reference.  The  present  FM  SR  lineshape  is  obtained  in  the 

situation  of  a  repulsive  interaction  between  Cs  (6D3/2)  and  a  sapphire  (c^ )  window  (see 

Failache et al., 1999 and 2003). 

Figure  14  :  The  consistency  of  the  vW  fitting  over  a  pressure-induced  modification  of  the 

resonance width. One has simultaneously extrapolated from the fittings a simultaneous linear 

pressure broadening, and a vW strength independent of he pressure. The FM SR experiments 

are  performed  in  the  situation  of  a  repulsive  interaction  between  Cs  (6D3/2)  and  a  sapphire 

(c^ ) window, with spectra such as the one shown in Fig 13.  

Figure 15 : Scheme of an experiment aiming at detecting anisotropy effects in vW shift, with 

a resolved  Zeeman structure. The two lasers have a similarly polarization, perpendicular to 

the magnetic field B, so that they induce inside the vapor (bulk) an identical interaction. In SR 

spectroscopy, there remains a cylindrical symmetry for the vW interaction for the experiment 

with the (//)laser (B along the surface normal), that is destroyed for the (^

) laser (B parallel to 

the surface.

shift  between  ETC  resonances,  and  volume  resonances,  illustrates  the  signature  of  the  vW 

interaction. 

Figure 17 : The energy level scheme of Cs that could lead to a surface-induced level-crossing 

in the vicinity of a sapphire window (c^ ). The 6D3/2 level is strongly repelled by the sapphire  

surface, while the 6D5/2 level undergoes an ordinary vW attraction.

  for  a  BaF2  window  (solid  line),  and  a  CaF2  window  (dashed 

line).  The  predicted  surface  resonances  should  enable  resonant  coupling  of  a  (virtual)  atom 

absorption  with  a  thermally  excited  surface.  The  data  (see  Failache  (1999))  has  been 

extrapolated from the bulk values as given in Kaiser et al. (1962). 

 

 

 

 

Figure  19  :  The  principle  of  the  experiment  for  the  detection  of  a  surface-induced 

metastability transfer. The detector of metastable states (e.g. initial state  3P0 , or  3P2 transfer 

state) can be rotated from the direction of the incident atomic beam, to the direction q

f. The 

incident  beam  is  here  oriented  parallel  to  the  interacting  surface,  i.e.  q

 = 0.  The  region  of 

surface interaction extends over a length up to 50 µm (for a slit) down to 50 nm (for a nano-

grating) (cf. Boustimi et al., 2001).

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel concept of flow to measure the efficiency of urban street 
networks  (a  kind  of  complex  networks)  for  travel  or  shipping  goods.  More  specifically,  we 
define  two  quantities:  flow  dimension  and  flow  capacity,  to  characterize  structure  of  urban 
street  networks.  To  our  surprise  for  the  topologies  of  urban  street  networks,  previously 
confirmed as a form of small world and scale-free networks, we find that (1) the range of their 
flow  dimension  is  rather  wider  than  their  random  and  regular  counterparts,  (2)  their  flow 
dimension  shows  a  power-law  distribution,  and  (3)  they  has  a  higher  flow  capacity  than  their 
random  and  regular  counterparts.  The  findings  confirm  that  (1)  the  wider  range  of  flow 
dimension and the higher flow capacity both can be a signature of small world networks, and (2) 
the flow capacity can be an alternative quantity for measuring the efficiency of networks or that 
of the individual nodes. The findings are illustrated using three urban street networks (two in the 
Europe and one in the USA), and three other non-spatial networks. We further conjecture that 
the flow capacity of living organisms is higher than that of static systems. In other words, living 
organisms are more efficient than static systems.

1. Introduction 
Urban street networks can be seen as an interconnected graph from two different and contrast perspectives. 
On  the  one  hand,  an  urban  street  network  is  regarded  as  a  graph  with  nodes  and  edges  representing 
respectively the junctions and street segments. This can be called a geometric approach. On the other hand, 
in  contrast  to  the  geometric  approach,  a  topological  approach  regards  an  urban  street  network  as  an 
interconnected graph consisting of nodes representing individual named streets (Jiang and Claramunt 2004), 
and  edges  linking  the  nodes  if  the  corresponding  streets  are  intersected.  The  difference  between  the  two 
approaches is subject to whether or not geometric distance plays an important role in the graph theoretical 
representations. For the geometric approach, the graph edges (street segments) are weighted by the distance 
between the two corresponding junctions. With the topological approach, an entire street is collapsed as a 
node,  and  all  the  edges  have  a  unit  weight.  In  other  words,  there  is  no  weighting  difference  among  the 
edges.  The  geometric  approach  is  an  advantageous  representation  in  conventional  network  analysis 
(Haggett  and  Chorley  1969)  and  transportation  modelling  (Miller  and  Shaw  2001)  with  geographic 
information  systems,  but  it  is  not  good  for  illustrating  the  structure  of  urban  street  networks,  since  the 
structure captured by the geometric approach is pretty simple, i.e., 3 or 4 links for most road junctions. 
 
The topological approach is a holistic approach that considers the interrelationship of individual streets for 
better  understanding  the  underlying  structure  of  urban  street  networks.  This  is  consistent  with  human’s 
cognition  of  large-scale  environments.  For  example,  in  conveying  a  direction  from  location  A  to  B,  we 
often  refer  to  a  number  of  named  streets  that  constitute  the  path.  Using  MSN  Maps  &  Directions 
(mappoint.msn.com), we can easily make a query from where you live to where you work. The returned 
direction or path would consist of a number of named streets attached with mileages. It appears to suggest 
that topology is primary (at a structural level), and geometry is secondary (at a detailed level). In fact, a city 
is indeed an interconnected whole consisting of paths, edges, districts, nodes and landmarks at a cognitive 
level  (Lynch  1960).  In  a  similar  fashion,  a  city  can  be  perceived  as  an  interconnected  whole  that  links 
individual units (Alexander 1965). These individual units or constituents have different geometric sizes and 
shapes, but they are all perceived individually as a perceivable unit at a structural level. Alexander’s “a city 
is not a tree” suggests that a city is neither a tree nor a regular lattice, but a semilattice with some shortcuts 
among some far-distant units. Interestingly enough, this semilattice structure is very similar to the structure 
that we found with the topologies of urban street networks.

The topologies of urban street networks have an efficient structure, which is demonstrated by a variety of 
other  biological,  information,  technological,  and  social  networks.  The  structure  is  called  a  small  world 
network that is an intermediate status between an order and disorder. It has a higher efficiency in the sense 
of transporting information, goods or virus at both local and global levels, when compared to their regular 
and random counterparts. This view of high efficiency can be seen from two prominent properties of small 
world  networks,  i.e.  a  small  separation  and  a  high  degree  of  clustering.  In  a  social  setting,  a  small 
separation  implies  that  any  two  arbitrarily  chosen  persons  A  and  B  are  linked  by  a  short  chain  of 
intermediate persons.  The person  A knows  someone,  who  knows  someone,  …  who knows  the person  B, 
and the number of someone is no more than 6. This is so called “six degrees of separation”, which has been 
empirically verified by the well known experiment conducted by Milgram (1967). It should be noted that 
the  two  persons  A  and  B  are  randomly  chosen  from  a  large  population,  say,  the  entire  population  of  the 
planet.  On  the  other  hand,  small  world  networks  tend  to  be  highly  clustered.  It  means  that  friends  of  a 
friend are likely to be friends. From a point of view of information flow, information can be diffused very 
quickly  from  one  to  another  globally,  and  it  spreads  also  efficiently  among  the  circle  of  the  friends. 
Although we use social networks for example, the efficient structure explained holds true for a wide variety 
of  information,  biological,  and  technological  networks  (for  comprehensive  surveys,  refer  to  Albert  and 
Barabási 2002, Newman 2003, or more recently, Boccalettia et al. 2006, and Newman, Barabási and Watts 
2006). It also helps to explain why computers can be infected overnight, and why SARS virus can diffuse 
so quickly among the large population of human beings. The beauty of the small world networks lies in the 
fact that it retains an efficient structure respectively obtained from its regular and random counterparts (c.f. 
section 2 for more explanations).  
 
This  paper  aims  to  introduce  a  new  concept  and  computation  of  flow  for  characterising  the  structural 
properties of urban street networks. This work is motivated by the efficiency view of small world networks, 
in terms of how information flows among the nodes of a complex network. In this connection, Latora and 
Marchiori (2001) suggested a new formulation of the small world theory from the efficiency point of view. 
However,  the  formulation,  actually  current  literature  in  small  world  networks,  does  not  fully  capture  the 
complexity of flow occurred in real world systems. With the new concept of flow, we define two relevant 
quantities: flow dimension and flow capacity, to measure the degree of flow exchanges. The concept and 
quantities  are  applied  to  three  urban  street  networks  to  illustrate  some  nice  structural  properties.  To  our 
surprise  for  the  topologies  of  urban  street  networks,  previously  confirmed  as  a  form  of  small  world  and 
scale-free  networks,  we  find  that  (1)  the  range  of  their  flow  dimensionality  is  rather  wider  than  their 
random  and  regular  counterparts,  (2)  their  flow  dimension  shows  a  power-law  distribution,  and  (3)  they 
have  a  higher  flow  capacity  than  their  random  and  regular  counterparts.  The  findings  have  special 
implications for urban street networks, as the topologies of which can be regarded a network infrastructure 
to  service  the  flows  of  various  kinds,  e.g.  vehicle  flows,  people  flows,  or  goods  flow  etc..  We  further 
demonstrated  that  the  findings  hold  true  for  other  social,  biological,  technological  and  information 
networks.  
 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section two introduces some basic mathematics of the 
small world and scale-free networks from a point of view of information flow. Section three presents the 
concept and computation of flow using a simple notational street network. In section four, we report our 
major findings based on the computation of flow dimensions and capacities for three urban street networks, 
and  three  other  non-spatial  networks.  Finally  section  five  concludes  the  paper  and  points  out  our  future 
work.  
 
 
2. Mathematics of small world and scale-free networks  
To introduce small world networks, let’s start with a big world of lattice illustrated in figure 1(a). Imagine 
that this regular lattice is expanded to include up to hundreds of millions of nodes, so obviously it is a very 
big  world.  Generally  speaking,  distance  from  any  node  to  any  other  node  tends  to  be  very  large,  as  in 
general  one  has  to  travel  node  by  node  to  reach  his/her  destination.  However  the  situation  can  be 
significantly  tipped,  if  we  add  some  new  edges  that  bring  some  far-distant  nodes  together  (a  sort  of 
shortcuts) as illustrated in figure 1(b). The shortcuts significantly shorten the distance from any node to any 
other node in general, so the lattice is transferred to a semilattice – a small world. To understand why the 
semilattice is a small world, we must introduce basic mathematics of graphs and networks.

(Note: different from the initial Watts’ model (Watts and Strogatz 1998) and similar to Newman and Watts 
(1999), we randomly add a few new edges, but the new edges do not significantly change the average 
degree of the lattice) 

 
A graph G(V,E) consists of a finite set of vertices (or nodes) 

(where the number of nodes 
VV × . The initial 
is n) and a finite set of edges (or links) E, which is a subset of the Cartesian product 
small world and scale-free networks are based on the connected graphs whose edges have neither directions 
nor weights. This kind of graph can be simply represented by an incidence matrix R(G):

R(G) is sufficient for a complete description of the graph G. For a complete graph, in which every node 
 edges. However, most real world networks are far sparser than a 
links to every other, there are 
complete  graph.  If  on  average  every  node  has  m  edges  (average  degree),  then  a  sparse  graph 
. The following two measures (or equivalently the initial small world and scale-
implies
free  network  models)  are  based  on  the  undirected,  unweighted,  and  connected  graphs,  but  this  paper  has 
released  the  constraints.  It  implies  that  the  concept  of  flow  is  applicable  for  directed,  weighted  and 
unconnected graphs as well.  
 
Distance is a basic concept of graph theory (Buckley and Harary 1990), and fundamental for small world 
between two vertices i and j of a graph is the minimum length of the 
networks as well. The distance 
paths that connect the two vertices, i.e., the length of a graph geodesic. For a given graph, the length of the 
iv far  from  all  other 
maximum  graph  geodesic  is  called  graph  diameter.  The  distance  of  a  given  vertex 
vertices is called average path length. It is defined by

From the equations, we might have a better sense of understanding of why the above lattice tends to be a 
big world. It is because that the average path length of a graph is increased with the square of the number of 
nodes  ( n ),  i.e.,  the  more  nodes,  and  the  longer  the  average  path  length.  This  is  unlike  the  one-
dimensional lattice whose path length is linearly increased. For a lattice that contains hundreds of millions 
of nodes, the average path length tends to be a large value. However the introduction of some shortcuts into 
a large lattice can significantly reduce the average path length, and thus shrink the big world into a small 
one. Actually a random graph whose edges are randomly determined in terms of which node links to which 
node also has a short average path length according to random graph theory (Bollobás 1985), first studied 
by  Erdös  and  Rényi  (1960).  For  a  random  graph,  the  average  path  length  is  increased  very  slowly 
, where m is the average degree of the 
(logarithmically) with the number of nodes, i.e.,

graph. So in terms of average path length, a small world network is very similar to a random network, i.e., a 
small  separation  between  two  arbitrarily  chosen  nodes  of  the  network.  This  implies  that  a  small  world 
network has a very efficient structure for information flow at a global level.  
 
Information  flows  efficiently  not  only  at  the  global  level,  but  also  at  a  local  level,  i.e.,  in  the  circle  of 
immediate  neighbouring  nodes.  Again  with  the  lattice  in  figure  1a,  every  node  has  eight  neighbouring 
nodes. If the eight nodes all have an edge each other (being a complete graph), then there would have in 
 possible  edges.  But  actually  there  are  only  12  edges  as  we  can  see.  The  ratio  12/28=0.43 
total 
indicates the degree of clustering for the eight neighbouring nodes, the higher the ratio, the more efficient 
information flows among the neighbours. Obviously the highest value of the ratio is 1, when the neighbours 
are highly connected as a complete graph, i.e. every node links to every other node. From the information 
flow point of view, the highly connected complete graph has a maximum efficiency. This can be seen from 
our daily lives. If all of my friends are friends with one another, then information about me can be spread 
maximally among the circle of  my friends. In reality, friends of a people are hardly fully connected as a 
complete  graph,  BUT  any  two  of  the  friends  are  likely  to  be  friends  in  general.  This  implies  a  high 
clustering  degree  for  a  people  or  a  social  network  in  general.  The  clustering  degree  is  measured  by  the 
clustering coefficient (Watts and Strogatz 1998) that can be simply defined by,

The high efficiency of small world networks comes from an important fact that for most of real networks 
like the Internet the connectivity is unevenly distributed among the nodes. In other words, connectivity is 
not randomly decided. A very few nodes are far more connected than others. The highly connected nodes 
are called hubs. The special category of small world networks is called scale-free networks (Barabási and 
Albert  1999),  which  can  be  used  to  explain  why  a  small  world  is  a  small  world.  It  is  because  of  the 
existence  of  hubs.  It  also  helps  to  understand  the  nature  of  dynamics  and  evolution  of  many  real  world 
networks. It is important to note the relationship between the small world networks and scale-free networks. 
In general, a scale-free network is certainly a small world, but not vice verse. Small world networks can be 
put  into  different  categories  in  terms  of  the  nature  of  connectivity  distribution  (Amaral  et  al.  2000),  and 
they all appear to have an efficient structure. In the next section, we will introduce the concept of flow for 
better characterizing the efficiency of networks or individual nodes.  
 
  
3. Defining the concept of flow: dimension and capacity 
Having  introduced  small  world  networks  from  the  point  of  view  of  information  flow,  in  this  section  we 
attempt  to  define  the  concept  of  flow.  Flow  is  often  referred  to  movement  of  energy,  material  or 
information  from  one  place  to  another  through  complex  networks.  In  reality,  there  are  different  kinds  of 
flows, such as vehicle flows, information flows, and flows of innovation, rumour, and virus. However, in 
this paper, we refer to flow as a property of networks or that of the individual nodes. How efficient a street 
network or a street within the network is capable to drive people or vehicle’s movement is subject to the 
underlying structure. The structure can be characterized by two flow related quantities: flow dimension and 
flow capacity.  
 
For  the  sake  of  convenience  and  simplicity,  but  without  loss  of  generality,  we  adopt  a  notional  street 
network for illustration of the concept and computation of flow. The notional street network consists of 11 
streets (s1-s11) and 20 junctions (j1-j20) (figure 2). If we concentrate on the two pairs of streets <s1, s4> (in 
fact any pair from the set <s1, s2, s3, s4>, or equivalently any pair from the set <s5, s6, s7, s8>) and < s9, s10>, 
clearly  the  former  pair  has  four  other  streets  cutting  across,  while  the  latter  has  only  two  streets  cutting 
across. It appears that the left lattice is more efficient than the right one in transporting people or vehicles. 
This  observation  provides  a  basic  inspiration  to  develop  the  concept  of  flow  for  characterizing  structural 
property of a network, or that of individual nodes with the network.

Figure 2: A notional street network 

 
To further illustrate the concept of flow, we represent the notional street network as a topology by taking 
streets as nodes and street intersections as links of a connected graph (figure 3a). This connected graph is 
actually derived from a street-street incidence matrix  S (c.f. matrix A1 in the appendix). To see how much 
flow  between  every  pair  of  streets,  we  compute  the  flow  matrix  using  the  operation 
 (c.f. 
matrix A2 in the appendix). The flow matrix can be represented as a flow graph in figure 3b, where edge 
thickness  represents  flow  dimensions.  Both  the  connected  graph  and  flow  graph  are  undirected,  but  one 
unweighted and another weighted.

 (Note: flow dimension is indicated by edge thickness with respect to 1, 2, and 4 with the figure  b) 

 
The  flow  dimension  refers  to  the  number  of  common  streets  shared  by  a  pair  of  streets,  i.e.,  a  sort  of 
intersection strength between the pair. For instance, the pair <s1, s4> has four common streets (i.e., s5, s6, s7 
and s8), while the pair <s9, s10> has just two common streets. The magnitude of flow dimension reflects the 
degree of flow between a pair of streets. Taking a path s2-s3-s9 for example, the first half path (s2-s3) is very 
wide, while the second half path (s3-s9) very narrow. This flow graph is the starting point to define flow 
capacity. For the purpose of defining and computing the flow capacity, we slice the flow graph at different 
dimensional levels. First the flow graph itself represents the situation at dimension one, i.e, all edges above 
the dimension one are retained. We can respectively filter out those edges whose flow dimension less than 
one, and less than two. In the end, flow graphs at dimension two (figure 4a) and four (figure 4b) are formed. 
This  slicing  technique  is  taken  from  Q-analysis  (Atkin  1974),  a  computational  language  for  structural 
description. The technique is given other names such as m-cores (Scott 1991), or m-slices (Nooy et al. 2005) 
in social network analysis.

Before formally defining the concept of flow capacity, we assume the sliced flow graphs serve as a network 
infrastructure  for  information  flows.  The  flow  graphs  at  lower  dimensions  can  only  transport  low 
dimensional  information,  while  the  high  information  needs  high  flow  graphs.  This  can  be  compared  to 
different lanes of a street. For instance, bicycles can ride in a car lane, but cars cannot drive in a bicycle 
lane. The bicycles and cars are in analogy with low dimensional and high dimensional information in this 
case. Therefore the flow graph in figure 3(b) can only diffuse one-dimensional information flows, and the 
flow graph in figure 4(b) can diffuse four-dimensional information flows. Simply speaking, flow capacity 
is a ratio of flow width to flow length. Taking the node s1 for example, its flow capacity at dimension one 
∑

d

indicates dimension one and denominator represents the flow length from the particular node to all others. 
Clearly, the subscript of d indicates dimension one. At dimension two and four (with respect to figure 4a

capacities at the individual dimensions is the flow capacity of the node s1, i.e., (5+6+12). To get rid of size 
effect, the sum is divided by 11*(11-1), so in the end the flow capacity of the node is (5+6+12)/(11*(11-
1))=0.21 
 
Having  illustrated  the  computation  of  flow  capacity  with  the  example,  we  can  remark  that  there  are  two 
factors  that  decide  the  flow  capacity.  One  is  called  flow  dimension  and  another  is  flow  length  (actually 
distance  of  geodesic  at  different  dimensional  levels).  Intuitively,  a  higher  flow  dimension  and  a  shorter 
flow length lead to a higher flow capacity. In general, for a vertex

It is important to note that the above definition is illustrated with an undirected, unweighted and connected 
graph,  but  it  holds  true  for  a  directed,  weighted,  and  unconnected  graph  as  well.  Obviously  a  complete 
graph has a biggest flow capacity, since every node has a biggest flow dimension on the one hand, and a 
smallest flow length from every node to every other on the other. It should be noted that so far the flow 
capacity is defined as a measure for individual streets and the network of the streets. For the topological 
approach, both primal and dual approaches are transferable (Batty 2004, Jiang and Claramunt 2002). The 
above  definition  and  computation  can  also  be  applied  to  the  individual  junctions  of  a  street  network.  To 
achieve this, we must derive a street-junction incidence matrix first. Taking the notional street network for 
, 
example,  the  street-junction  matrix  is  represented  as  a  incidence  matrix  of  the  size 
namely SJ (see matrix A3 in the appendix). Actually the previous street-street incidence matrix  S  can be 
derived  using  operation 
 (NOTE:  the  diagonal  elements  are  set  as  zero,  the  same  for  the 
following  matrix  J ).  In  the  same  fashion,  we  can  derive  the  junction-junction  incidence  matrix  J ,  i.e., 
J
 (see matrix A4 in the appendix). Furthermore, using the junction-junction incidence matrix, 
the junction-junction flow matrix  FJ can be derived (see matrix A5 in the appendix). Based on the flow 
graph  and  using  the  above  formulas,  the  flow  capacity  for  the  individual  junctions  and  for  the  entire 
topology can be computed.  
 
 
4. Computing the flow dimension and capacity for structuring urban street networks 
We applied the concept and computation of flow to three urban street networks: Gävle (Sweden), Munich 
(Germany) and San Francisco (USA), including respectively 565, 785 and 637 streets – the same datasets 
used in our previous work (Jiang and Claramunt 2004). The reader may notice from figure 5 that Munich is 
a  natural  (self-organized  or  self-evolved)  city,  and  San  Francisco  an  artificial  (or  planned)  city,  whereas 
Gävle is somewhere between the natural and artificial cities, in particular with reference to the fact that two 
neighbours  with  Gävle  are  surrounded  by  ring  roads.  With  the  networks,  we  intend  to  illustrate  some 
hidden  structure  or  patterns,  in  comparison  to  their  regular  and  random  counterparts.  A  first  step  is  to 
complete the transformation from a network to topology using the topological approach introduced at the 
beginning  of  the  paper.  Figure  5(d)  illustrate  the  topology  transformed  from  the  San  Francisco  street 
network. A second step is to derive the flow graphs based on the topologies, and further compute the flow 
capacity  for  the  individual  nodes  and  for  the  entire  topology.  Three  major  findings  are  derived  from  the 
experiments.

The first finding is that the range of flow dimensions of the topologies is extremely wider than that of their 
regular and random counterparts (table 1). For instance, the Gävle topology involves 14 flow dimensions, 
while the number for its random and regular counterparts is only 2 and 3 (table 2). This fact can be further 
illustrated through a special visualization of the topologies. Again, taking the Gävle case for example, we 
arrange  the  topology  layer  by  layer  in  terms  of  flow  dimensions,  i.e.,  from  the  bottom  of  a  lowest 
dimension  to  the  top  of  a  highest  dimension.  Figure  5  demonstrates  the  fact  of  fourteen  layers  with  the 
Gävle topology, and two layers with the random counterpart.

The  second  finding  is  that  the  flow  dimension  demonstrates  a  power-law  distribution  with  different 
connectivity exponents: 2.9 for Gävle, 3.6 for Munich, 1.2 for one part of San Francisco and 7.7 for another 
part (see figure 7 for the log-log plots). It implies that most streets have a quite low flow dimension, but a 
few  streets  have  an  extremely  high  flow  dimension.  This  finding  has  a  special  implication  for 
understanding  traffic  flows  in  urban  systems.  That  is,  always  making  those  streets  of  an  extremely  high 
flow dimension through would significantly ease the traffic of an entire network system. It is important to 
pay more attention on the San Francisco network, as there are two parts of power-law tails. These two parts 
reflect the bipartite structure of the network separated by the long street cutting across left-bottom to right-
top corner of the street network, and also the bipartite structure of the topology (figure 5). The distributions 
of the flow dimension appear to fit to that of the degree or street connectivity distribution illustrated with 
our previous work (Jiang and Claramunt 2004, Jiang 2005).

The third finding is that the flow capacity of the topologies is larger than that of the random and regular 
counterparts (Table 2). This suggests that flow capacity can be a good indicator for determining whether or 
a real world network is a small world. This reminds us of the fact that the flow dimension resembles to the 
clustering  coefficient,  and  the  flow  length  to  the  average  path  length.  Therefore,  the  concept  of  flow 
capacity combines the initial two small world properties together into one formula, and it can be regarded 
as an alternative measure of network efficiency.

It should be noted that the above findings are made based on the primal topologies of urban street networks 
by taking the named streets as the nodes of the topologies, and eventually flow dimension and capacity are 

 

9

assigned to individual streets. However, we can also take the dual topologies of urban street networks by 
taking  the  junctions  as  the  nodes  of  the  topologies.  This  way  the  flow  dimension  and  capacity  can  be 
computed  and  assigned  to  the  individual  junctions.  Due  to  computational  intensiveness,  currently  we  are 
unable  to  obtain  the  flow  capacity  for  the  individual  junctions  of  an  entire  network.  However,  our 
experiments  based  on  partial  networks  illustrated  the  similar  findings  as  above.  Figure  8  illustrates  the 
geographic  distribution  of  the  flow  capacity  for  the  individual  streets  and  junctions  of  the  Sätra 
neighbourhood network with Gävle. It is represented respectively as the line thickness and dot size. We can 
remark that the flow capacity for streets fits quite well to that of junctions. To this point, we have seen how 
the flow dimension and capacity are defined and computed for both streets and junctions of the urban street 
networks.

The  study  is  mainly  originated  and  based  on  urban  street  networks  for  the  illustration  of  concept  and 
computation of flow dimension and capacity, but with three other types of complex networks, we have got 
almost the same results (see Figure 9 for the log-log plots, Table 3 for flow dimensions and Table 4 for the 
computed flow capacities). Cross comparing the flow capacities of the networks, we can conjecture that the 
living  organisms  have  a  higher  flow  capacity  than  static  systems.  To  preliminarily  verify  this,  we 
experimented on macaque and cat cortico-cortical connections (Scannell 1997), the same datasets used in 
Latora and Marchiori (2001). The flow capacities of the two living systems are respectively 236 and 2540, 
far greater than that of urban street networks.

The  above  findings  have  some  universal  values.  This  is  particular  true  for  knowledge  or  innovation 
diffusion which often needs multiple disciplinary expertises, in order for a knowledge chunk to be spread. 
For example, with an organization, individuals’ expertise is different from one to another, and those who 
share  expertises  (common  nodes)  are  likely  to  have  a  common  language,  and  thus  to  have  a  knowledge 
chunk more quickly diffused from one to another. Those who have interdisciplinary background are likely 
to  form  m-cores  for  better  knowledge  diffusion.  The  concept  of  flow  can  help  to  differentiate  from  one 
organization  network  to  another,  or  the  individual  people’s  abilities  in  transferring  knowledge  within  an 
organization.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper proposed the new concept of flow to characterize structural properties of urban street networks 
from  both  local  and  global  levels.  At  the  local  level,  it  helps  to  differentiate  individual  streets  (or 
equivalently junctions) from one to another in terms of efficiency and helps to identify key structural streets 
or junctions. At the global level, it further illustrates the fact that an urban street network departs it from its 
random and regular counterparts based on the single measure flow capacity. A major advantage of the flow 
capacity is that it takes flow dimension into account while measuring efficiency of individual units or the 
entire network as a whole. Despite of the modelling capability, we must stress that the flow is a structural 
property, not the flows in reality such as vehicle and people flows. Whether the flow capacity can be a good 
indicator for real world flows is still an open question. It certainly implies for our future work.  
 
Before any empirical verification of the concept and computation of flow, we tend to rely on its exploratory 
capability rather than possibilities of predicting real world flows. It helps to understand and explore traffic 
flows from a structural point of view. Taking the notional street network again for example, apparently it 
consists of two lattices: one to the left with four parallel streets at each direction crossed each other, and 
another to the right with two parallel streets crossed. From the structural point of view, the left lattice has a 
higher flow capacity than that of the right one. Thus it forms a gap or hole between the two lattices in terms 
of  information  flows.  From  the  structural  point  of view,  traffic  jams  are  likely  to  occur between  the  two 
lattices. Of course, in reality traffic jams may not occur at all, if the number of vehicles is very low, or the 
vehicles  are  coordinated  well.  However  the  structural  analysis  based  on  the  flow  capacity  can  help  to 
indicate  the  possibility.  We  believe  this  is  one  of  the  major  contributions  of  this  paper  besides  the  three 
major findings.

From this street-junction incidence matrix, we can derive easily the above street-street incidence matrix S, 
(using  Matlab  code  for  convenience).  In  the  same  fashion,  we 
i.e.

derive a junction-junction incidence matrix 
 

 as follows:

Abstract

Relying  on  the  obtained  results  in  Ref.[1],  we  derive  the  formula  relating  the
red-shift of light signals coming from distant  galaxies  to  the  distance  of  these  galaxies
from us and the time of detecting of these light signals. The red-shift coefficient, instead
of the Hubble parameter, is introduced. It varies with time and positive at all times. Its
nowadays  value  equals  the  Hubble  parameter.  It  increases  forever  as  time  is  running
from  the  past  to  the  future.  The  derived  formula  enables  us  to  estimate  the  nowadays
increasing rate of the red-shift  coefficient,  which  is  nothing  but  the  nowadays  value  of
the “acceleration of  the expansion of the Universe”.

1. Introduction

In  the  Earth-related  coordinate  system  { x

model of cosmology based on the assumption of the cosmological principle and the perfect gas (or fluid)
[1]. We exactly solved Einstein’s field equation involved,

where  t  is relative to the SC-moment at which the geometric structure of space-time of the Universe is of
the Minkowskian [1]. Eq.(3a) specifies the cosmological constant to be zero. Eq.(3b) exhibits the equation
of state for the matter of the Universe. Eq.(3c) is the line element for space-time of the Universe.

The time-evolution of the line element surely affects some physical processes that occur in large region of
space. In this paper, we are concerned with the red-shift of light signals coming from distant galaxies [2-
8].

2. The Earth-related coordinate system

Einstein  made  an  exquisite  definition,  from  the  measurement  point  of  view,  for  inertial
coordinate  system:  “in  a  given  inertial  frame  of  reference  the  coordinates  mean  the  results  of  certain
measurements  with  rigid  (motionless)  rods,  a  clock  at  rest  relative  to  the  inertial  frame  of  reference
defines a local time, and the local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized clocks and taken
together,  give  the  time  of  this  inertial  frame  of  reference.”[9].  As  defined,  an  observer  binding  to  an
inertial  frame  of  reference  can  employ  his  motionless-rigid  rods  and  motionless-synchronized  clocks  in
the so-called “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method to measure
space  and  time  intervals.  By  using  this  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”
measurement  method,  the  observer  sets  up  his  inertial  coordinate  system  [10-12].  This  definition  is  of
course suitable for the  case  of  no  gravitational  field.  In  the  presence  of  a  gravitational  field,  the  inertial
frame  of  reference  is  no  longer  inertial  and  a  different  set  of  motionless-rigid  rods  and  motionless-
synchronized clocks will be called for and employed by the observer. It is therefore our understanding that
an  observer  binding  to  the  Earth-related  inertial  (at  least  approximately  inertial)  frame  of  reference  in
which the Earth is always at  rest  still  can,  in  the  presence  of  the  gravitational  field,  set  up  a  coordinate
system by using the motionless-rigid rods and motionless-synchronized clocks existing in the gravitational
field.  We  call  this  coordinate  system  the  Earth-related  coordinate  system.  It  is  not  inertial  unless  the
gravitational field  is  turned  off.  In  our  case  of  the  gravitational  field  of  the  Universe,  we  can  set  up  the
Earth-related  coordinate  system  by  use  of  the  motionless-rigid  rods  and  motionless-synchronized  clocks
existing in the gravitational field of the Universe.

Since  it  is  the  motionless-rigid  rods  and  motionless-synchronized  clocks  existing  in  the
gravitational  field  of  the  Universe  that  we  employ  in  our  cosmological  measurements,  the  measurement
data are all available in the Earth-related coordinate system. On the other hand, we did [1] and we now do
theoretical calculations also in the Earth-related coordinate  system.  The  comparison  between  calculation
results and measurement data can be therefore made directly in the Earth-related coordinate system.

To  get  the  equation  of  motion  for  light  propagation,  we  can  set  ds 2

0=   in  the  line  element

Eq.(3c). Doing so, we have

3. Red-shift of light signals from distant galaxies

Suppose  a  light  signal  of  frequency  ν

,θ φ).
 
This signal is later detected by us on the Earth at time  t  and determined to have frequency  ν. It is then
compared to a light signal of the same type, produced or emitted at time  t  on the Earth, whose frequency
is ν

1   is  emitted  at  time  t1   on  a  galaxy  located  at  ( r,

0 . Experimental measurements reveal a red-shift,

ν ν<

0  or  z ≡

0

−
ν ν
ν

>

0 .  

According to Hubble, the red-shift is proportional to distance  r  of the galaxy from us,

where  H   is  the  Hubble  parameter  or  constant.  Still  according  to  Hubble,  the  red-shift  is  due  to  the
Doppler effect, and hence

where  y  is the recessional speed of the galaxy from us. Both Eqs.(7a-b) are called the Hubble law [2-8,
13-18].

The  emissions  of  two  light  signals,  at  t1   on  the  galaxy  and  at  t   on  the  Earth,  are  both  of  the
physical process occurring in a localized small region of space. They are under control of some interaction
other than gravity. They are beyond physics of the gravitational field of the Universe. It is thus natural to
recognize ν ν

 and the red-shift then means

as the formulas for red-shift of light signals coming from distant galaxies. In Eqs.(12) and (13), the red-
shift  is  described  in  two  ways,  in  terms  of  emission  time  t1   and  detecting  time  t   and  in  terms  of
detecting time  t  and distance  r  of the galaxies from us. The emission time and detecting time are both
relative to the SC-moment.

Formula Eq.(13) has more plenty of physical meanings from the experimental point of view. We

can rewrite Eq.(13) as

where  H t( )  is called the red-shift coefficient. The red-shift coefficient is a function of the detecting time.
It  is  positive  at  all  times,  from  − ∝   to  ∞ .  That  indicates  no  blue-shift  for  light  signals  coming  from
distant galaxies. The red-shift coefficient increases at all times, too, as time is running from the past to the
future.  The  nowadays  red-shift  coefficient  equals  the  Hubble  parameter  H t( ) = H .  But  at  the  SC-
moment, it was or will be equal to

4. Nowadays cosmological year

We have to depend on experimental measurements to determine whether it is “was” or “will be”.

We do not have the concept of the age of the Universe because time  t  in the line element Eq.(3c)
can be any value between  − ∝  and  ∞ . Anyway, to introduce the concept of nowadays cosmological year
is appropriate. To estimate it,  we  recall  the  data  of  the  mass  density  of  gravity-interacting  matter  in  the
Universe and the Hubble parameter [19-21],

ρ

  and  H =70~72 Km/sec/Mpc.

Putting them into Eq.(14b) and using the equality of  H t

, one can find

Ht

which  leads  to  t = 15.1  billion  years.  This  t   is  positive,  so  the  nowadays  cosmological  year  is  around
15.1 billion years after the SC-moment. As for the red-ship coefficient at the SC-moment, we put the data
of  ρ and  H  into Eq.(15) and find

Around 15.1 billion years ago the red-shift coefficient was little more than half of the nowadays red-shift
coefficient.

5. “Accelerating Expansion of the Universe”   

We already see that the red-shift coefficient increases forever as time is running. The rate of this

increase can be found from Eq.(14b),

( )
Q t

≡

( )
dH t
dt

= 

πρ

exp(

πρ

) .

(16)

We call it the increasing rate of red-shift coefficient. It is also positive at all  t ∈ −∞ ∞

(

,

) .

In  the  current  standard  model  of  cosmology,  the  Hubble  parameter  has  the  meaning  of  the
expansion rate of the universe [13-18]. If the red-shift coefficient  H t( )  had the same meaning, Eq.(16)
would imply the increasing rate of the expansion rate of the Universe, i.e. an acceleration of the expansion
of the Universe. That explains the observed “accelerating expansion of the Universe”.

Using the estimated nowadays cosmological year and the data of  ρ and  H  above, we find the
nowadays  increasing  rate  of  red-shift  coefficient  or  the  nowadays  value  of  the  “acceleration  of  the
expansion of the Universe”,

Q t( ) ≈ 2761 Km2/sec2/Mpc2.

It is very small but detectable, as reported [3-8].

6. Concluding remarks

We have derived the formula relating the red-shift of light signals coming from distant galaxies
to  the  distance  of  these  galaxies  from  us  and  the  time  of  detecting  of  these  light  signals.  The  red-shift

5

coefficient,  instead  of  the  Hubble  parameter,  has  been  introduced.  The  red-shift  coefficient  is  time-
dependent.  It  is  positive  at  all  times.  It  increases  forever  as  time  is  running  from  the  past  to  the  future.
Based  on  the  derived  formula,  we  have  further  estimated  the  nowadays  cosmological  year.  It  is  around
15.1 billion years after the SC-moment. We have also estimated the nowadays increasing rate of red-shift
coefficient or the nowadays value of the “acceleration of the expansion of the Universe”. It is about 2761
Km2/sec2/Mpc2.

However,  to  us,  the  red-shift  of  light  signals  coming  from  distant  galaxies  is  not  due  to  the
Doppler  effect.  The  root  cause  of  this  red-shift  lies,  not  on  moving  sources  or  moving  detectors  of  light
signals, on the time-evolution of the line element of space-time in the gravitational field of the Universe.
This time-evolution affects some, if not all, physical processes occurring in large region of space. This is
the influences of the gravitational field of the Universe on these physical processes.

Do we really need the concepts such as the expansion of the Universe, the Big-Bang and the dark

energy?

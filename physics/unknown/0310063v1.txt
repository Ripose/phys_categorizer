ABSTRACT 

 
This  paper  provides  an  overview  of  operational  applications  of  GNSS-R,  and  describes 
Oceanpal®,  an  inexpensive,  all-weather,  passive  instrument  for  remote  sensing  of  the 
ocean and other water surfaces. This instrument is based on the use of reflected signals 
emitted  from  GNSS,  and  it  holds  great  potential  for  future  applications  thanks  to  the 
growing,  long  term  GNSS  infrastructure.  The  instrument  exploits  the  fact  that,  at  any 
given  moment,  several  GNSS  emitters  are  simultaneously  in  view,  providing  separated 
multiple  scattering  points  with  different  geometries.  Reflected  signals  are  affected  by 
surface  “roughness”  and  motion  (i.e.,  sea  state,  orbital  motion,  and  currents),  mean 
surface  height  and  dielectric  properties  (i.e.,  salinity  and  pollution).  Oceanpal®  is 
envisioned  as  an  accurate,  “dry”  tide  gauge  and  surface  roughness  monitoring  system, 
and  as  an  important  element  of  a  future  distributed  ocean  remote  sensing  network 
concept. 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 

GNSS 

constellations 

and 
Several 
augmentation 
systems  are  presently 
operational, such as the Global Positioning 
System  (GPS),  owned  by  the  United 
States,  and,  to  some  extent,  the  Russian 
GLObal  NAvigation  Satellite  System 
(GLONASS).  In  the  next  few  years,  the 
European  Satellite  Navigation  System 
(Galileo)  will  be  deployed.  By  the  time 
Galileo becomes operational in 2008, more 
than  50  GNSS  satellites  will  be  emitting 
very  precise  L-band  spread  spectrum 
signals, and will remain in operation for at 
least  a  few  decades.  Although  originally 
meant  for  localization,  these  signals  will 
not  doubt  be  used  within  GCOS/GOOS. 
The 
immediate  objective  of  Starlab’s 
Oceanpal®  project  is  the  development  of 
technologies for operational in-situ or low-
altitude  water  surface  monitoring  using 
GNSS  Reflections,  a  passive,  all  weather 
radar technology of great potential. 

Oceanpal®  is  an  offspring  of  technology 
developed  within 
several  ESA/ESTEC 
projects  targeted  on  the  exploitation  of 

GNSS  Reflections  from  space1,  following 
the  proposal  of  M.  Martín-Neira  (1993). 
We  also  note  that  GNSS-R  is  but  an 
example  of  passive,  bistatic  radar  (see, 
e.g.,  Cantafio  1993),  a  subject  with  a 
long history. In fact, bistatic radar was a 
subject  of  research  in  the  early  days—
see  Conant  (2002)  for  a  fascinating 
account of radar history.  

Although  our  focus  here  is  on  low 
altitude  applications,  it  is  worthwhile 
explaining in more detail the rationale for 
spaceborne  deployment:  an  important 
aspect  of  the  GNSS-R  concept  is  the 
synergy  between  space  and  ground 
monitoring  using  the  same  technology 
and the same signal infrastructure, which

Results  from  recent  ESA  studies  and 
experiments  and  also  from  our  colleagues 
in  the  United  States  indicate  that  GNSS-R 
data  can  provide  sufficient  information  to 
resolve  mesoscale  features  in  the  ocean, 
as  well  as  co-located  directional  mean

should  allow  mapping  of  the  mesoscale 
variability  in  high  eddy  variability  regions

These  studies  also 
indicate  that  the 
combination  of  GNSS  with  Jason-1  and 
ENVISAT  data  can  improve  the  sea  level 
mapping  derived  from  the  combination  of 
Jason-1 and ENVISAT by a factor of about

As  recent  ESA  studies  indicate,  a  single 
GNSS-R  Low  Earth  Orbiter  can  provide 
samplings  of  less  than  100  km  resolution

equivalent  altimetric  precision  better  than 
5  cm,  sufficient  for  competitive  Mesoscale

capable  of  picking  as  many  as  12  signals 
from  GPS,  Galileo  and  Inmarsat  satellites 
would  have  significant  impact  on  the 
mapping  of  the  mesoscale  variability. 

The  precision  and  sampling  provided  by 
such  measurements  may  also  make 
GNSS-R  an  effective  tool  for  Tsunami

RECENT COASTAL EXPERIMENTAL 
CAMPAIGNS 

Many  experiments  have  taken  place  to

ground.  The  reader  is  invited  to  read

on Starlab’s Coastpal campaign.

the 

Recent 
coastal  GNSS-R  experimental 
campaigns  led  by  Starlab  have  collected 
data from low altitude stationary platforms 
in  a  wide  range  of  sea  state  conditions, 
using  both  the  experimental  equipment 
lent  by  ESA/ESTEC  and  an  Oceanpal® 
prototype.  Some  of  these  campaigns  (the 
Starlab Coastpal series) have been carried 
out in the Barcelona harbor breakers, with 
the  logistic  support  of  the  Barcelona  Port 
Authority.  

As  shown  in  Figure  2,  two  antennas  are 
usually  employed  to  collect  GPS  signals: 
one  antenna  (the  “direct”  or  “up-looking” 
antenna)  is  zenith  looking and Right Hand 
Circularly  Polarized  to  collect  the  direct 
GPS  signal,  while  the  other  one  (the 
“reflected”  or  “down-looking”  antenna)  is 
nadir/side looking and Left Hand Circularly 
Polarized  to  recover  the  reflected  signal. 
The  output  from  each  the  antenna  is  sent 
to a GPS front end. The IF data generated 
by  the  receivers  is  then  recorded  at  a 
sufficiently  high  sampling  frequency,  after 
(typically)  being  digitized  at  one  bit.  The

The  STARLIGHT  processor,  through  the

the  reflected  field  magnitude  and  phase. 
The  retrieved  field  contains  very  useful 
information  on  the  characteristics  of  the 
reflecting  surface.  Comparison  between 

this  field  and  the  direct  one  is  then 
performed  to  infer  the  desired  quantities, 
such  as  sea  roughness  and  sea  level. 
Recent  altimetric  results  using  the  phase 
in  mild  sea  conditions  are  at

The  use  of  multi-frequency  bistatic 
specular  scattering  instruments  is  very 
important  to  validate  models,  and  may 
provide  clues  on  how  to  separate  ocean

surface wind and wave age).

from  a  static 
platform,  the  electric  field  scattering  from 
a  frozen  ocean  could  be  represented  as  a 
static  complex  phasor  (representing  the 
phase  and  amplitude  of  the  electric  field). 
The  reader  can  then  readily  imagine  that 
the motion of the ocean surface translates 
into  motion  of  the  phasor  in  the  complex 
plane.  

In  Figure  4  we  can  see  such  a  phasor 
representation  of  the  reflected  electric 
field  (at  GPS  frequencies)  simulated  using 
Fresnel  scattering  from  an  virtual  ocean

Analysis  of  the  dynamics  of  the  reflected

surface  parameters

platforms.  In  Figure  3,  for  instance,  we

by surface “roughness”, motion (sea state,

exploits  the  “noisy”  reflected  electric  field 
to  infer  ocean,  river,  or  lake  surface

directly  for  scientific  studies  of  ocean-
atmosphere coupling. 

Given  the  growing  GNSS  availability  and 
long-term outlook for GNSS service signals, 
the  combination  of  GNSS-R  data  from  air, 
ground and space can provide a long lasting 
oceanographic  monitoring  infrastructure  for 
decades to come.

coastal, river or lake applications. Top right: The dynamic L-band reflected electric field in
a complex phasor representation of the amplitude and phase modulation of the carrier as
produced  by  a  virtual  moving  ocean  after  a  few  seconds  of  time  evolution,  from  a
simulation  using  Starlab’s  GRADAS  software  package  (phasor  amplitude  units  are
arbitrary).  Bottom:  On  the  left,  the  dynamic  phasor  of  the  direct  and  reflected  GPS  L1
field after one second of time evolution, using data from a coastal experiment processed
using Starlab’s STARLIGHT software (units are SNRV, integration time is 10 ms). On the
right, a typical Oceanpal® correlation waveform.

Figure 5. Oceanpal® interface concept. On the top panel, general information
on the location of the sensor is provided, as well as on the available network of
sensors  and  resulting  overall  sea  state  or  Sea  Surface  Height  map.  On  the
second  panel,  the  sea  state  (SWH  index)  is  shown,  as  well  as  visual  and
acoustic cues on sea state. In the third panel, the Sea Surface Height is shown,
as well as information in the form of text. Finally, information on the available
satellites and signal “health” are provided.

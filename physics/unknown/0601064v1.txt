Abstract

In this paper the existence of the thermal tachyons i.e. quanta of temperature field, with 
 
is  described  in  the  theoretical  frame  of  hyperbolic  thermal  equation.    The  modified  Lorentz 
transformation are developed. It is argued that thermal tachyons can exist in accordance with 
.  The  thermal  tachyons  fulfill  the 
modified  Lorentz  transformation  after  change
hyperbolic heat transport equation and in principle can be created by attosecond laser pulses. 
Key words: Tachyons; Thermal processes; Attosecond laser pulses.

Introduction 

1. 
The square of the neutrino mass was measured in tritium beta decay experiments by fitting the 

shape  of  the  beta  spectrum  near  endpoint.  In  many  experiments  it  has  been  found  to  be 

negative. According to the results of paper [1]

)

. 

Based on special relativity superluminal particles, i.e. particles with 

2 <m

0

 and 

v >

c

 were 

proposed  and  discussed  in  paper [1,  2].  In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  possibility  of  the 

existence  of  the  superluminal  particles  from  the  point  of  view  the  hyperbolic  heat  transport 

equation.  It  will  be  shown  that  hyperbolic  heat  transport  equation  is  invariant  under 

transformation

In  this  equation  T   is  the  absolute  temperature,  v   denotes  the  speed  of  the  thermal 

disturbance,  and  D T  is  diffusion  coefficient  for  thermal  phenomena.  Equation (1)  describes 

the damped thermal wave propagation. Recently, the observation of the thermal wave in GaAs 

films exposed to ultra-short laser pulses was presented [2]. In the subsequent we will consider 

the mathematical structure of the Eq. (1) which can be interested for both the experimentalist 

as well as the theorist involved in ultrahigh ultra-short laser pulses. In the monograph [3] it 

was shown that speed  v , and diffusion coefficient 

 in Eq. 

(1) can be written as 

TD

In formula (2) 

α

 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant,  h  is the Planck constant, 

m

 is 

the mass of the heat carrier, and c is light velocity.  

Let us consider the transformation

We  conclude  that  the  Eq. (1)  is  invariant  under  the  transformation (3).  One  can  say  that 

Eq. (1) is valid for the universe for which 

2c−

 is the invariant constant.

 the tachyons, i.e.

 according to the formula (14). As 

can be seen only for 

1

, both formulae (14) and (15) give the same results. We can 

conclude that in the region of 

1

 we can, in principle, discover the strange behavior 

of the particle, with increasing 

 its speed is decreasing. 

One can conclude that the irradiation of the matter with attosecond laser pulse can produce the 

thermal  tachyons,  which  propagate  with  speed 

v >

c

.  It  must  be  stressed  that  the  fact  that 

v >

c

  does  not  violate  the  special  relativity  as  described  in  paragraph 1.  Moreover,  the 

thermal  tachyons  fulfils  the  same  thermal  transport  equation 

(1)  as  the  particles  with 

v < . 
c

The  experimental  method  best  suited  for  the  observation  of  the  thermal heatons is  the  TOF 

(Time of Flight) measurement of the velocity of the emitted particles. 

On the experimental ground the existence of the tachyons is still an open question. However, 

the  results  of  papers [1,  2]  strongly  suggest  the  existence  of  the  particles  with  masses 

m =*

Conclusions 
In this paper it is shown that the hyperbolic heat transport equation can be applied to the study 

of  the  thermal  tachyons.  It  is  argued  that  the  particles  with    masses 

m =*

im

  can  propagate 

with velocity 

v >

c

 and do not break the new Lorentz transformation

In this lecture some mathematical tools necessary for a proper description of the Heisenberg
antiferromagnet are presented. We would like to point out diﬀerences between ferro- and antiferro-
magnetic cases of Heisenberg Hamiltonian for ﬁnite spin systems. The ground–state properties are
discussed.

A. Ferromagnet (J > 0)

The Heisenberg model of magnetism has been investigated for years. For the ﬁnite spin system consisting of N <

spins ~s we obtain the following formula

where the ﬁrst sum is taken over all nearest-neighbor pairs
(number of the nearest-neighbor pairs will be denoted hereafter as

ij
h

i

).

N

and h is an external magnetic ﬁeld parallel to z-axis

The ground state of the ﬁnite Heisenberg ferromagnet has the following properties:

for h = 0 the ground state is (2N s + 1)-tuplet with total spin number S = N s and energy per spin

The above properties agree with the classical results (all spins are ‘parallel’) and with the thermodynamic limit

B. Antiferromagnet (J < 0)

The classical ground state of antiferromagnet is described by the so-called N´eel state conﬁguration

.
i
It is evident that this state has two-fold degeneracy. If one deﬁnes (see1) the N´eel state as a state with opposite
magnetizations in (ferromagnetic) sublattices (i.e. SA = SB = N s/2 and MA =
MB), then the degeneracy of this
state is N s + 1. On the other hand Marshall and Peirels have proved that the ground state of antiferromagnet is a
singlet with S = M = 02. Moreover, simple calculations for ﬁnite spin systems show that the ground state has the
following properties

the ground state is a singlet even for h = 0;

the energy gap ∆
S = M = 1 (for very large h in the ground state S = M = N s — the ferromagnetic ground state is obtained).

C. Finite Lattice Method

Considerations of ﬁnite spin systems is very popular and eﬀective method, therefore it has been frequently applied
since the pioneer work of Bonner and Fisher3. Number of states, which should be considered, is (2s + 1)N , so it grows
4 square lattice there are 216 = 65536 states!). Therefore a lot of methods are used
very quickly (for s = 1/2 and 4
in order to decrease a dimension of the Hamiltonian eigenproblem or to simplify the solving procedure (e.g. Lanczos
method4, combinatorial methods1 and group-theoretical method5). In the last case a translation group of considered
lattice is taken into account, as a rule. In contrary, we investigate also a point group and a space group (of ﬁnite
lattice), therefore a more complete state classiﬁcation scheme can be obtained6.

II. METHOD

A. Short Description

The most important aim of our work is to determine the ground state of (ﬁnite) Heisenberg antiferromagnet and
4 lattice,

its properties. It has been done for spin systems with s = 1/2 and a linear chain up to 16 spins, square 4
and a 2

2 cube. The results and the detail description is presented elsewhere (see7). The main

points of used procedure are following

1. Find number N0 of states with total magnetization M = 0 (more precisely — we calculate a dimension of

subspace L0 containing such states);

2. Determine this states, i.e. determine the basis

in the subspace L0;

B

3. Decompose this basis into orbits of the space group (since the space group

is a subgroup of the symmetry

group ΣN , then one can consider the action of ΣN on

);

B
4. It can be proved that when N s is even number then the ground state is “fully” symmetric (i.e. it transforms as
the unit irrep), therefore from each subspace spanned on a given orbit one (the unique) such state is chosen;

S

5. The eigenproblem for the operator ~S2 (square of total spin ~S) is solved for these states (the eigenvalues of this

operator are 0, 2, 6, . . . , N s(N s + 1) and the equation ~S2

= 0 is the most interesting);

6. After the above presented steps the states labelled by M = 0, Γ = Γ0, and S = 0 are obtained and the ground
;

state is a linear combination of these states — it is determined by solution of the eigenproblem

7. As a result the ground state is obtained as a linear combination of the so-called Ising conﬁgurations and its

properties can be easily determined (e.g. spin-spin correlations, staggered magnetization, etc.).

It should be underlined that this procedure gives only the ground state, therefore the thermodynamics properties of
the considered system cannot be determined. These properties can be found when one solves eigenproblems for each
total spin number S = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N s and for each irrep of the space group.

The ﬁrst three steps can be done applying combinatorial methods. The problem is: ‘Find all states with a given
i mi = M ’. Since the magnetization operator
can be considered. In the

magnetization, i.e. states

simplest case s = 1/2 number of states with the magnetization equal M is given by the binomial coeﬃcient

The fourth step of our procedure is to determine symmetry adapted basis of subspace L0 according to the symmetry
group of the considered Hamiltonian. It means, that only these permutations σ
ΣN are taking into account which
preserve order of points (‘neighborhood). These elements form (ﬁnite) space group of ﬁnite lattice. It can be shown
that in the one-dimensional case it is the group CN v = CN 2Cs = DN . From it follows that for a hypercubic lattice
in d-dimensional space the space group is given as a wreath product9

∈

where elements of the symmetric group Σd permute axes of d-dimensional coordinate system. The above group is
called a complete monomial group (of degree d) of the group CN v. The considerations of a linear representations of
this group in the subspace L0 give us the appropriate symmetry adapted basis, which is used in the next steps of our
procedure (5–7). These steps are performed using numerical methods (solution of eigenproblem for real symmetric
matrix).

III. FINAL REMARKS

Using the above described method we have obtained, e.g., energy per site for 16-spin linear chain. Its value —
0.4432. Therefore, one can
0.446 — is very close to the exact result in the thermodynamic limit — 1/4

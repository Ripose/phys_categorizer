Abstract

The maximal Abelian subalgebras of the Euclidean e(p, 0) and pseudoeu-
clidean e(p, 1) Lie algebras are classiﬁed into conjugacy classes under the action
of the corresponding Lie groups E(p, 0) and E(p, 1), and also under the confor-
mal groups O(p + 1, 1) and O(p + 1, 2), respectively. The results are presented
in terms of decomposition theorems. For e(p, 0) orthogonally indecomposable
MASAs exist only for p = 1 and p = 2. For e(p, 1), on the other hand, orthog-
onally indecomposable MASAs exist for all values of p. The results are used to
construct new coordinate systems in which wave equations and Hamilton-Jacobi
equations allow the separation of variables.

Introduction

The stage of much of mathematical physics is the real ﬂat space Rn with a non-
degenerate indeﬁnite metric of signature (p, q). We shall denote this space M (p, q)
with p + q = n. The isometry group of this space is the pseudoeuclidean group
E(p, q) and the conformal group is C(p, q)
O(p + 1, q + 1) (the pseudoorthogonal
group in p + q + 2 dimensions, acting locally and nonlinearly on M (p, q)).

∼

The purpose of this article is to present a classiﬁcation of the maximal Abelian

subalgebras (MASAs) of the real Euclidean and pseudoeuclidean Lie algebras e(p, 0)
e(p) and e(p, 1). The classiﬁcation is ﬁrst performed with respect to conjugation un-
der the corresponding Lie groups E(p, 0)
E(p) and E(p, 1), respectively, and it
also provides a classiﬁcation of the connected maximal Abelian subgroups of the
corresponding groups E(p) and E(p, 1). We also present a classiﬁcation of MASAs
of the corresponding conformal algebras c(p, 0)
o(p + 1, 2)
under the corresponding groups O(p+1, 1) and O(p+1, 2). This classiﬁcation is used
to show (for q = 0 or 1) which MASAs of e(p, q) are also MASAs of o(p + 1, q + 1)
and which MASAs that are inequivalent under E(p, q) are nevertheless mutually
conjugated under the larger conformal group O(p + 1, q + 1).

The classiﬁcation of MASAs of e(p, q) (q = 0, 1) will be used to address a phys-
ical problem: the separation of variables in Laplace-Beltrami and Hamilton-Jacobi
equations in the corresponding spaces M (p, q).

The motivation for our study of subgroups of Lie groups and subalgebras of Lie
algebras is multifold. For instance, consider any physical problem leading to a system
of diﬀerential, diﬀerence, algebraic, integral or other equations. Let the set of all
solutions of the system be invariant under some Lie group G, the ”symmetry group”.
Special solutions, corresponding to special boundary, or initial conditions, can be
constructed as ”invariant solutions”, invariant under some subgroup of the group
G [1, 2]. For linear equations, or for Hamilton-Jacobi type equations, solutions
obtained by separation of variables are examples of invariant solutions. While all
G are relevant to this problem, Abelian subgroups provide
types of subgroups G0 ⊂
particularly simple reductions and particularly simple coordinate systems. Indeed,
each one-dimensional subalgebra of an Abelian symmetry algebra will provide an
”ignorable” variable [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], i.e. a variable that does not ﬁgure in the
metric tensor (a ”cyclic” variable in classical mechanics).

Another example of the application of maximal Abelian subgroups of an invari-
ance group is in any quantum theory, where Abelian subalgebras provide sets of
commuting operators that characterize states of a physical system. The system it-
self is characterized by the Casimir operators of the group G. Complete information
about possible quantum numbers would be provided by constructing MASAs of the
enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra L of G. MASAs of the Lie algebra itself provide
additive quantum numbers.

A third application is in the theory of integrable systems, both ﬁnite and inﬁnite

2

dimensional, where MASAs of any underlying Lie algebra provide integrals of motion
in involution, commuting ﬂows, and other basic information about the systems.

A series of earlier articles was devoted to MASAs of the classical Lie algebras,
such as sp(2n, R) and sp(2n, C) [9], su(p, q) [10], so(n, C) [11] and so(p, q) [12].
Special roles amongst all MASAs of simple and semisimple Lie algebras are played by
Cartan subalgebras on one hand and maximal Abelian nilpotent algebras (MANSs),
on the other. The Cartan subalgebras are their own normalizers [13] and consist
entirely of nonnilpotent elements. For a complex semisimple Lie algebra there is, up
to conjugacy, only one Cartan subalgebra. For real semisimple Lie algebras they were
classiﬁed by Kostant [14], and Sugiura [15]. Maximal Abelian nilpotent subalgebras
consist entirely of nilpotent elements (represented by nilpotent matrices in any ﬁnite
dimensional representation). They were studied by Kravchuk for sl(n, C) and his
results are summed up in book form [16]. Maltsev obtained all MANSs of maximal
dimension for the simple Lie algebras [17]. Those of minimal dimension have also
been studied [18].

More recently, the study of MASAs was extended to the inhomogeneous classical
Lie algebras, or ﬁnite dimensional aﬃne Lie algebras, starting from the complex
Euclidean Lie algebras e(n, C) [19].

The next natural step is to consider the real Euclidean and pseudoeuclidean al-
gebras e(p, q) for p
0. This study is initiated in the present article where we
concentrate on the values q = 0 and 1. On one hand, these are the most important
ones in physical applications, since they include the Lie algebras of the groups of mo-
tions E(p) of Euclidean spaces and E(p, 1) of Minkowski spaces. On the other, they
are the simplest ones to treat, so all results are entirely explicit. The general case
of q
2 will be treated separately and is more complicated from the mathematical
point of view.

≥

The classiﬁcation strategy and some general results on the MASAs of e(p, q) are
presented in Section 2. The real Euclidean algebra e(p) is treated in Section 3 where
we also list the MASAs of o(p, 1) and classiﬁcation of MASAs of e(p) under the
action of the group O(p + 1, 1). Section 4 then treats MASAs of e(p, 1). Section 5
lists results on MASAs of o(p, 2) and the classiﬁcation of MASAs of e(p, 1) under the
action of the conformal group O(p + 1, 2) of compactiﬁed Minkowski space M (p, 1).
In other words, certain MASAs not conjugated under E(p, 1), are conjugated under
the larger group O(p + 1, 2). MASAs of e(p, 1) are used in Section 6 to obtain
maximal Abelian subgroups of E(p, 1). These in turn provide us with all separable
coordinate systems in Minkowski space M (p, 1) with a maximal number of ignorable
variables. Some conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

From the above discussion we see that the pseudoeuclidean Lie algebra is the
semidirect sum of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra o(p, q) and an Abelian algebra
T (n) of translations.

Since T (n) is an ideal in e(p, q), we can consider the adjoint representation of
o(p, q) on T (n). Abusing notation, we use the same letters P1, . . . , Pp, Pp+1, . . . , Pp+q
for basis vectors in this representation. The metric tensor gµν deﬁned above provides
an invariant scalar product on the representation space

(P, Q) = gµν PµQν.

2.2 Classiﬁcation strategy

The classiﬁcation of MASA’s of e(p, q) is based on the fact that e(p, q) is the semidi-
rect sum of the Lie algebra o(p, q) and an Abelian ideal T (n) (the translations). We
use here a modiﬁcation of a procedure described earlier [19] for e(n, C). We proceed
in ﬁve steps.

A MASA of o(p, q) is characterized by a set of matrices X and a ”metric” matrix
K, satisfying eq. (2.3). A MASA can be orthogonally indecomposable (OID), or
orthogonally decomposable (OD). If it is OD, we decompose it, i.e. transform it,
together with K, into block diagonal form. Each block is an OID MASA of some
o(pi, qi),

qi = q. At most one of the blocks is a MANS.

We see that in eq. (2.28) the algebra e(p, q) is embedded as a subalgebra of one
of the maximal subalgebras of o(p + 1, q + 1), namely the similitude algebra sim(p, q)
obtained by setting β = 0 in (2.28). The MASAs of e(p, q) are thus embedded into
o(p + 1, q + 1). In each case we shall determine whether a MASA of e(p, q) is also
maximal in o(p + 1, q + 1). Conversely this representation can be used to determine
whether a MASA of o(p + 1, q + 1) is contained in e(p, q). Finally, we shall use
it to establish possible conformal equivalences between MASAs of e(p, q) that are
inequivalent under E(p, q).

Proof. Let us use the representation (2.1) of e(p, 1). The translations are repre-
sented by the matrix Y with X = 0. We run through the three translation subal-
gebras T ﬁxed in Theorem 4.1 and for each of them ﬁnd their centralizer C(T ) in
o(p, 1), i.e. the set of matrices X and Y, such that we have

[Y (X, 0), Y (0, α)] = 0

(4.5)

for the chosen set of the translations α. We must then determine all MASAs of C(T )
such that they commute only with T and with no other translations.

A) For T = T (k+, 1, 0) we have C(T )

o(p

the MASA will commute with k+ + 1 positive length vectors. We thus arrive
at eq.(4.2).

containing a nilpotent element will also commute with an isotropic vector
in T, not contained in T (k+, 0, 0). Hence we need only to consider a Cartan
k+, 1). Moreover, it must be noncompact, or it will commute
subalgebra of o(p
with a negative length vector in T. Finally, if p
k+ is even, the MASA will
commute with k+ + 1 positive length vectors in T. We arrive at the result in
eq.(4.3).

4.2 Nonsplitting MASA’s of e(p,1)

First we describe the general procedure for ﬁnding nonsplitting MASAs of e(p, q).

Every nonsplitting MASA M (k+, k

, k0) of e(p, q) is obtained from a splitting

one by the following procedure:

1. Choose a basis for C(k+, k

3. Form the elements

˜Ba = Ba +

˜αajYj,

a = 1, . . . , J

(4.7)

−

−

N

Xj=1

14

where the constants ˜αaj are such that ˜Ba form an Abelian Lie algebra [ ˜Ba, ˜Bb] =
0. This provides a set of linear equations for the coeﬃcients ˜αaj. Solutions ˜αaj
are called 1-cocycles and they provide the Abelian subalgebras ˜M (k+, k
−
˜Ba, Xb} ⊂
{

, k0)

∼

e(p, q).
4. Classify the subalgebras ˜M (k+, k
−

, k0) into conjugacy classes under the action

of the group E(p, q). This can be done in two steps.

i) Generate trivial cocycles taj, called coboundaries, using the translation

group T (n)

epjPj ˜Bae−

pjPj = ˜Ba + pj[Pj, ˜Ba] = ˜Ba +

tajPj.

(4.8)

The coboundaries should be removed from the set of the cocycles. If we
have ˜αaj = taj for all (a, j) the algebra is splitting (i.e. equivalent to a
splitting one).

ii) Use the normalizer of the splitting subalgebra in the group O(p, q) to

further simplify and classify the nontrivial cocycles.

for all nonsplitting MASAs of e(p, 1). Hence for case A) from Theorem 4.1 there are
no nonsplitting MASAs. In the case B) the block (M0, β0) represents the element of
the type Lp,p+1 + apPp + ap+1Pp+1. Here again the coeﬃcients ai are coboundaries,
since we have

exp (αpPp + αp+1Pp+1)Lp,p+1 exp (

αpPp −

αp+1Pp+1) =
Lp,p+1 + αpPp+1 + αp+1Pp

−

(4.15)

and the coeﬃcients αi can be chosen so as to annul ap and ap+1. We have that
β0 = 0, and there are no nonsplitting MASAs. In the case C) the nonsplitting part
of M0 is as follows

Commutativity [Ze, Z ′e] = 0 gives us the following conditions

Looking again at the commutativity condition with eq.(4.20) satisﬁed, we ﬁnd

that

and

µ = 0.

(4.21)

The symmetric matrix A represents the 1-cocycles. The coboundaries are repre-
sented by the matrix δI and we use them to set T rA = 0. To further simplify
and classify we use the normalizer of the splitting MASA in the group o(p, 1). The
normalizer is represented by block diagonal matrices of the same block structure as
in eq.(4.1). The part acting on M0 is represented by

G = diag(g, G0, g−

1, 1),

satisfying

G0GT

0 = I.

Computing

gives the following transformation of A

A′ =

We use the matrix G0 to diagonalize A and to order the eigenvalues. The normal-
ization a1 = 1 is due to a choice of g. The proof of the case ii) is almost identical to
the previous one and we omit it here. The dimension of the nonsplitting subalgebra
2
is the same as the dimension of the corresponding splitting subalgebra.

MASAs corresponding to diﬀerent values of κ, or diﬀerent sets (a2, . . . ap) are
mutually inequivalent under the connected component of E(p, 1). If the entire

κ =

A MASA can be orthogonally indecomposable, but not absolutely indecomposable
(OID, but NAOID). This means it is orthogonally decomposable after complexiﬁca-
tion of the ground ﬁeld.

The algebra o(2, 2) is exceptional for two reasons, namely we have p = q =even
and moreover, it is semisimple rather than simple. Two orthogonal decompositions
exists, namely those of Proposition 5.2 with s = 0, l = 1 in the ﬁrst case, s = 1, l = 0
in the second. The MANS of eq.(5.7) also exist in this case, as does the MASA (5.10),
not however (5.8) and (5.9). On the other hand, two further MASAs exist, both
decomposable, but not orthogonally decomposable. In terms of matrices, they are
represented by

respectively. Thus o(2, 2) has 6 classes of MASAs. Propositions 5.1,. . . ,5.4 as well
as the results for o(2, 2), are proven in Ref [12].

Let us now sum up the results on MASAs of o(p, 2) in terms of the ”physical”

basis (2.7), (2.26), starting from orthogonally indecomposable ones.

Let us make use of the realization (2.28) of the algebra o(p + 1, 2) and choose K0 as

Let us now consider the individual decompositions of the space M (p, 1) listed in

0 1

eq. (4.29) of Theorem 4.3.

First of all we note that the presence of o(2) subalgebras acting in the M (2, 0)
subspaces (for l
1) implies an orthogonal decomposition of the corresponding
MASA of o(p + 1, 2). We are then dealing with Abelian subalgebras (ASA) of the
form

ASA[o(p + 1, 2)] = l[o(2)]

ASA[o(j + 1, 2)],

j + 2l = p.

(5.23)

From now on we only need to consider subalgebras of e(j, 1)

o(j + 1, 2) and
their possible conjugacy under O(j + 1, 2). These MASAs of o(j + 1, 2) contain no
rotations Lik. The following situations arise.

We see that the MASAs listed above in cases 4, 5 and 6 are all related. Indeed,

of the free rowed MASA (5.9) of o(j + 1, 2) with Kravchuk signature (2 j-1 2). To
determine the decomposition of the space M (j, 1), consider a general transformation

To obtain a decomposition we must annul as many as possible of the elements

equal to the highest multiplicity of an eigenvalue of the matrix Q. Since we have
T rQ = 0, the multiplicity is at most j

manner that the last entry in Q has the highest multiplicity equal to r. We then
choose a and b in eq. (5.30) so that the matrix in (5.29) has the form

6 Separation of variables in Laplace and wave operators

6.1 MASAs and ignorable variables

Let us consider an n-dimensional Riemannian, or pseudo-Riemannian space with
metric

ds2 = gik(x)dxidxk

(6.1)

and isometry group G. The Laplace-Beltrami equation on this space is

∆LBΨ = EΨ

∆LB = g−

g = det(gij)

(6.2)

Xi,j=1
and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is
gij ∂S
∂xi

∂S
∂xj = E.
We shall be interested in multiplicative separation of variables for eq.(6.2) and

(6.3)

additive separation for eq.(6.3), i.e. in solutions of the form

Ψ(x) =

ψi(xi, c1, . . . , cn),

S(x) =

Si(xi, c1, . . . , cn),

respectively. Here cj are parameters, the separation constants and ψi and Si obey
ordinary diﬀerential equations.

A variable xj is ignorable [8] if it does not ﬁgure in the metric tensor gik. Ignorable
variables are directly related to elements of the Lie algebra L of the isometry group
L be a basis for an Abelian subalgebra of L. We can
G [7]. Indeed, let X1, . . . Xl ∈
represent these elements by vector ﬁelds on M expressed in terms of the coordinates
x. Let us further assume that these vector ﬁelds are linearly independent at a generic
point x

M . We can then introduce (locally) coordinates on M

that ”straighten out” this algebra
∂

Xi =

i = 1, . . . , l.

The variables αi are the ignorable separable variables [7, 8]. Each MASA of the
isometry algebra L will provide a maximal set of ignorable variables, both for the
Laplace-Beltrami and the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Speciﬁcally for the spaces M (p, q) of this article, we generate the coordinates
as follows. We use the realization (2.2) of the group E(p, q) but restrict H to be a
maximal Abelian subgroup of E(p, q). We have G =< exp X >, where X is one of
the MASAs we have constructed. We then write

x
1 !

 

= eX

s
1 !

Rp+q

where s represents a vector in a subspace of M (p, q) parametrized by nonignorable
variables (s1, . . . , sk), and X is a MASA of e(p, q), parametrized by a set of ignorable
variables.

Ignorable variables in Euclidean space M(p)

dinates we have

In view of Theorem 3.3 we split the space M (p) into a direct sum of one and two-
dimensional spaces. In each M (1) we have a Cartesian coordinate xi, corresponding
to the translation Pi. In each subspace M (2) we have polar coordinates, e.g. M12 =
∂

Consider the decomposition (4.29) in Theorem 4.3. In each indecomposable sub-
space we introduce a separable system of coordinates with a maximal number of
ignorable variables. Each space M (1, 0) corresponds to a Cartesian coordinate,
M (2, 0) to polar coordinate as in eq. (6.9). Now let us consider the coordinates
corresponding to M (k, 1).

7 Conclusions

The classiﬁcation of MASAs of e(p, 0) and e(p, 1) performed in this article is com-
plete, entirely explicit and the results are reasonably simply.
Indeed, they are
summed up in Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 and 3.3 for e(p, 0) and Theorems 4.1, 4.2,
4.3 and 5.1 for e(p, 1).

In Section 6 we have presented a ﬁrst application of this classiﬁcation. Namely,
we have constructed the coordinate systems (6.12), (6.23) and (6.30) which allow
the separation of variables in the wave equation and have the maximal number of
ignorable variables. In turn, these coordinate systems have further applications.

Thus, instead of the wave equation itself, let us consider a more general equation,

namely

[2 + V (x)]Ψ = EΨ.

(7.1)

First of all, it is possible to choose the potential V(x) to be such that eq.(7.1) allows
the separation of variables in one of the above coordinate systems. The obtained
equation will be integrable in that there will exist a complete set of p second order
operators commuting with H = 2 + V and amongst each other. They will be of the
form X 2
is corresponding MASA and fi(xi) is a function of the
corresponding ignorable variable. The actual form of f depends on the separable
potential V (x) [21, 22].

i + fi(xi) where

The coordinates (6.30) have been used to construct equations of the type (7.1)
that obey the Huygens principle [23]. Crum-Darboux transformation [24] [25] [26]
can be used to generate speciﬁc potentials V (x) (depending on one ignorable variable
in a given separable coordinate system) that have speciﬁc integrability properties. In
particular this proviodes a method for constructing overcomplete commutative rings
of partial diﬀerential operators and ”algebraically integrable” dynamical systems
[27], [28], [29].

The reason we bring this up here is that traditionally the Crum-Darboux trans-
formations have been performed in cartesian, or polar coordinates. The fact that
they can be applied to other types of coordinates, associated to other types of
MASAs, opens new possibilities.

Work is in progress on the classiﬁcation of MASAs of e(p, q) for p

q

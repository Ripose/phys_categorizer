Through investigating history, evolution of the concept, and development in the theories 

of electrons, I am convinced that what was missing in our understanding of the electron 

is  a  structure,  into  which  all  attributes  of  the  electron  could  be  incorporated  in  a  self-

consistent way. It is hereby postulated that the topological structure of the electron is a 

closed two-turn helix (a so-called Hubius Helix) that is generated by circulatory motion 

of a mass-less particle at the speed of light. A formulation is presented to describe an 

isolated electron at rest and at high speed. It is shown that the formulation is capable of 

incorporating  most  (if  not  all)  attributes  of  the  electron,  including  spin,  magnetic 

moment,  fine  structure  constant  α,  anomalous  magnetic  moment 

),  and  charge

quantization  into  one  concrete  description  of  the  Hubius  Helix.  The  equations  for  the 

description  emerge  accordingly.  Implications  elicited  by  the  postulate  are  elaborated. 

Inadequacy of the formulation is discussed.

En  passant  en  revue  le  développement  des  théories  de  l'électron  ainsi  que  l'histoire  et 

l'évolution du concept lui-même, j'ai acquis la conviction que ce qui a manqué à notre 

compréhension  de  l'électron  est  une  structure  qui  rassemblerait  tous  ses  attributs  de 

façon cohérente. Il est postulé ici que la structure topologique de l'électron est une doule 

hélice fermée (appelée Hubius helix en anglais) qui est crée par le mouvement circulaire 

d'une particule sans masse à la vitesse de la lumière. Une formulation est présentée pour 

décrire  un  électron  isolé  au  repos  et  à  grande  vitesse.  Il  est  démontré  que  cette 

formulation est capable d'incorporer en une description conctréte de la double hélice de

1. CONCEPTS, HISTORY AND THEORIES  

The electron as one of the elementary particles is perhaps as old as the universe, if one 

associates  the  hierarchical  structure  of  the  constituents  of  matter  with  the  sequential 

events of creation and evolution of matter. The more elementary the building block of 

the constituent of matter, the earlier it should be created. However, as far as the origin 

of  the  word  is  concerned,  "electron"  was  coined  in  1894  by  J.  Stoney  to  denote  a 

definite quantity of electricity.  (1) The discovery of the electron as an isolated entity in 

the form of the cathode ray particles was attributed to J. J. Thomson by whom they were 

referred  to  as  corpuscles  and  their  charge  as  the  electron.  (2)  In  later  usage,  however, 

these particles themselves came to be called electrons. While J. Stoney emphasized the 

atomic nature of electricity, J. J. Thomson’s discovery and the subsequent work in his 

school established firmly that the electron is an elementary constituent of an atom and 

therefore of matter. Since then, the electrons have provided mankind with an ever-richer 

content of not merely physics, but science, technology, and our daily life at large.  

The  history  of  the  electron  can  be  viewed  in  two  ways,  either  as  consisting  of  a 

sequence of epochal events in which new attributes of the electron were revealed or as 

consisting of time periods marked by decisive progress in the conceptual understanding 

of the electron. Insofar as the isolated entity is concerned, the epochal events are:  

• Discovery of the electron in the 1890’s, based on several independent experiments a 

negative charge e, and mass m were assigned to the electron,  

• Recognition and verification of the increase of effective mass with velocity in 1905 

and 1906,  

• Assignment of the Compton wavelength λc =

to the electron from the scattering 

of X-rays by free electrons in 1923,

• Hypothesis of wave properties of the electron by de Broglie in 1924, λ=

was verified by C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer’s experiment of electron diffraction 

by crystals in 1927, and independently by G. P. Thomson in 1928,  

• Postulate of the concept of the spinning electron in 1925 and 1926 by G. Uhlenbeck

and S. Goudsmit, in which the spin angular momentum of  h2

• The discovery of the Dirac equation in 1928,  

•  Derivation  of  Zitterbewegung  of  the  electron  in  1930,  by  analyzing  the  Dirac 

equation  in  the  Heisenberg  representation,  E.  Schrödinger  arrived  at  the  fact  that 

there must be an oscillatory motion associated with a free Dirac electron, which he

named Zitterbewegung †,  

by C. Anderson in 1932,  

Foley in 1948.  

It  was  through  these  events  that  the  concept  of  the  electron  was  established  and  its 

attributes  were  revealed.  The  event-sequence  view  puts  emphasis  on  the  physical 

content of the concept of the electron, as a complement the time-period view provides a 

scenario of what man has achieved in understanding of the concept.  

According  to  the  time-period  view,  the  history  of  the  electron  can  be  divided  into 

four periods. The first period appears to start with a merging of knowledge from three 

4 

then (1880’s) totally unrelated disciplines of experimental science, electrolysis, cathode 

rays and radioactivity. It ended up with the discovery of the electron that was of particle 

nature  and  its  identification  as  an  elementary  constituent  of  the  atom.  The  second 

period, up to the discovery of the wave properties of the electron, is the history of the 

electron as a relativistic particle according to Abraham, Lorentz, Einstein and Poincaré. 

The third period was a period of striving to understand and finally accept the wave and 

spin  properties  of  the  electron  through  formulating  wave  mechanics  and  relativistic 

quantum theory of the electron. This period finished with the establishment of quantum 

electrodynamics (QED) that left us with a renormalization picture of the electron. The 

post  QED  era  of  the  electron’s  history  was  conjectured  as  the  fourth  period,  “a 

nonperturbative internal structure of the electron”. (3)  

Developments in the theories of the electron can be regarded as being evolved from 

the  classical  theory,  through  the  relativity  theory,  the  non-relativistic  quantum  theory, 

and  relativistic  quantum  theory  to  quantum  electrodynamics  and  to  refining  and 

extending the renormalization theory of the electron in the last 50 years. For reviews of 

the developments in the theory of the electron prior to QED readers are referred to Pais 

and  Weisskopf.  (4,  5)  For  reviews  of  the  developments  in  QED  and  quantum  field 

theories  see  R.  P.  Feynman  and  W.  Heitler  respectively.  (6,  7)  Various  aspects  of  the 

latest development in electron theory and QED were summarized in a recent volume of 

the NATO ASI series. (8)

2. WHAT WAS MISSING? 

In a little over one hundred years of the electron’s history, a tremendous progress has 

been achieved in details and applications of the electron theories. (9) While electrons are 

useful in the understanding of diverse phenomena, we have never really understood the 

electron  itself.  I  am  convinced  that  what  was  missing  was  the  very  nature  of  the 

electron—a structure, into which all attributes of the electron could be incorporated in a 

self-consistent way.  

The  nature  of  the  electron  has  been  an  enigma  confronting  physicists  of  past 

generations as well as contemporaries. (10, 11) The whole issue involved was typified by 

the late Asim Barut’s thought provoking questions (see reference 3): what is really an 

electron? What is the structure that gives its spin? What is the structure that can appear 

under probing with electromagnetic fields as a point charge, yet as far as spin and wave 

properties are concerned exhibits a size of the order of the Compton wavelength? Why 

must there be a positron? What is mass? Why and how does the electron manifest wave 

properties?  And  what  is  the  interaction  between  two  electrons  or  between  an  electron 

and a positron at short distances? A question of curiosity to seek for an intuitive picture 

of the electron may turn out to have far-reaching consequences, for “Theoretical physics 

has made use, for a long time, of abstract representations. ... They are indeed very useful 

and  even  almost  essential  auxiliaries  of  reasoning.  But  one  must  never  forget  that  the 

abstract  presentations  have  no  physical  reality.  Only  the  movement  of  elements 

localized in space, in the course of time, has physical reality”. (12) 

The abstraction, on the one hand, seeks to crystallize the logical relations inherent in 

the maze of material that is being studied, and to correlate the material in a systematic 

and  ordered  manner.  Intuitive  understanding,  on  the  other  hand,  fosters  a  more 

6 

immediate grasp of the objects one studies, a live rapport with them, which stresses the 

concrete meaning of their relations.  (13) While the abstract presentation prevails, a live 

rapport of the electron has not emerged over the years.  

“In speculating on the structure of these minute particles”, Lorentz remarked as early 

as  1909,  “we  must  not  forget  that  there  may  be  many  possibilities  not  dreamt  of  at 

present;  and  perhaps,  after  all,  we  are  wholly on a wrong track when we apply to the 

parts of an electron our ordinary notion of force”. (14) Fermi wrote in 1932 in concluding 

his  article  on  quantum  theory  of  radiation,  “In  conclusion,  we  may  therefore  say  that 

practically all the problems in radiation theory which do not involve the structure of the 

electron  have  their  satisfactory  explanation;  while  the  problems  connected  with  the 

internal  properties  of  the  electron  are  still  very  far  from  their  solution”.  (15)  In 

introducing  his  relativistic  quantum  theory  of  the  electron  in  1928,  Dirac  posed  a 

question “why Nature should have chosen this particular model [an electron with a spin 

angular momentum of half a quantum and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton] 

for the electron instead of being satisfied with the point-charge”. (16) As triumphs of the 

1
theory, spin  h2

 and magnetic moment 

e
h  of the electron were contained in Dirac’s 
mc
2

mathematical  construction,  but  left  unexplained.  (17)  The  following  twenty  years 

witnessed  fights  against  infinities  appearing  in  the  interaction  of  the  electron  with 

electromagnetic fields and finally the establishment of renormalized QED. (18, 19) In spite 

of  its  tremendous  success  in  calculations,  QED  cannot  be  considered  as  a  satisfactory 

solution to the problem of the electron.  (20) Being dissatisfied with the renormalization 

treatment of the infinities, Dirac pinpointed the trouble of QED being working from a 

wrong classical theory, and put forward a new classical theory of the electron as a basis 

7 

for a passage to the quantum theory. (20-22) Unfortunately he did not proceed to provide a 

clue as to how to bring in charge quantization, spin and Fermi statistics for the electrons 

in  making  the  passage.  Viewing  the  discovery  of  the  muon  as  new  evidence  for  the 

finite  size  of  the  electron  and  believing  “The  spin  angular  momentum  of  a  particle 

should be pictured as due to some internal motion of the particle”, (23) Dirac returned to 

the classical theory of the electron by modelling an electron as an extensible object. (24) 

A particular difficulty in developing his idea is to bring in the correct spin. Attempts of 

other  people  have  also  been  made  over  the  years  aiming  at  resolving  the  problems 

associated with the structure of the electron starting from self-energy, size and structure, 

spin, and Zitterbewegung, (3, 11, 25-28) to list just a few.  

It  is  understood  that  our  existing  knowledge  of  the  electron  imposes  immense 

constraints on, and yet provides hardly any hint to a self-consistent formulation of the 

structure.  In  this  article,  a  topological  structure  of  the  electron  is  postulated  as  a 

working hypothesis. As consequence and validity test of the postulate, a formulation is 

presented to describe an isolated electron at rest and moving at high speed. It is shown 

that  the  formulation  is  able  to  incorporate  most,  if  not  all,  attributes  of  the  electron, 

including  spin

3. THE POSTULATE  

The topological structure of the electron is a closed two-turn helix (a so-called Hubius 

Helix)  that  is  generated  by  circulatory  motion  of  a  mass-less  particle  at  the  speed  of 

light.  

The Hubius Helix can be expressed analytically by 

y = (R + r sin

)sinθ

, Where    R,r ∈R e ,    R > r > 0;

4. THE FORMULATION ¶ 

4.1. Point of Departure: mc 2 = hν 

In  1905  Einstein  proposed  two  basic  equations,  E = mc 2   in  the  special  theory  of 

relativity  for  particles  of  the  rest  mass  m,  and  E = hν  in  the  theory  for  photoelectric 

effect for photons of the frequencyν. About twenty years later L. de Broglie asserted 

that  E = hν  applied  to  particles  of  every  sort.  Then  the  two  equations  yield  the 

relationmc 2 = hν,  which  strongly  suggests  that  some  kind  of  oscillatory  process  be 

associated with matter. L. de Broglie himself always believed that the relation described 

real physical internal oscillations. To L. de Broglie, the relation defines the frequency as 

a  function  of  mass  or  vice  versa.  From  this  relation  L.  de  Broglie  derived

4.2. Quantization on Hubius Helix  

There  have  been  several  alternative  ways  to  establish  quantization  conditions  in  the 

development of the quantum mechanics, among others, Bohr-Sommerfeld-Wilson’s, de 

Broglie’s  and  Schrödinger’s  quantization  conditions.  Bohr-Sommerfeld-Wilson’s 

quantization condition introduced the action integral familiar in classical mechanics into 

quantum  theory,  acted  as  an  intermediate  step  in  the  discovery  of  nonrelativistic 

quantum mechanics, and was superseded by the latter. It may still give correct results in 

a limited number of problems in the cases of a single variable, and when the separation 

of variables is possible in the case of many degrees of freedom, Chapter 10 in (30) and (31), 

where the proof of equivalence of these quantization conditions are given as well. The 

10 

quantization on the Hubius Helix concerns a variable of one degree of freedom, thus the 

Bohr-Sommerfeld-Wilson’s  quantization  condition  is  applicable.  However,  in  view  of 

the  great  difficulties  and  serious  shortcomings,  the  construction  of  quantization 

condition  on  the  Hubius  Helix  will  not  follow  this  alternative.  Schrödinger’s 

quantization  condition  is  based  on  a  variation  principle,  as  well  as  the  analogy  of 

mechanics  and  optics.  The  first  derivation  was  based  on  a  “heuristic”  argument 

resembling the variation of average energy of the system, and later was thought by him 

as  “incomprehensible”.  In  the  second  derivation,  he  added  the  analogy  of  geometric 

optics  and  wave  optics  and  of  particle  and  wave  mechanics  to  put  his  equation  on  a 

secure  ground  by  the  variation  of  the  Hamiltonian  operator  of  a  quantum  system, 

Chapter 11 in  (30) and  (32). Schrödinger’s alternative treated the electron in the Coulomb 

field as a dynamic system. Through finding the quantum Hamiltonian of the system and 

applying variation principle to the action associated with the Hamiltonian, the problem 

of quantization is converted to the eigenvalue problem of differential equation, and the 

particle was replaced by the wave. The intention of the present work is not to treat the 

electron  as  a  dynamic  system,  but  as  a  topological/geometrical  object  or  a  spatial 

temporal structure, into which its physical attributes are then to be incorporated. From 

this  point  of  view,  the  construction  of  quantization  condition  on  the  Hubius  Helix  is 

thought to be in line with the geometrical argument put forward by de Broglie.  

De  Broglie’s  quantization  condition  emerged  in  the  end  of  the  proof  that  the 

Maupertuis’ principle of action for a particle moving a along a path is identical with the 

Fermat’s principle for the waves accompanying the particle:

In order to arrive at the proof, de Broglie verified that the group of the waves associated 

with the particle has the same velocity as the particle, and that the paths of the particles 

are identical with the rays of the waves. (29, 30)

path.  The  former  equation  implies  that  the  wave  along  the  path  must  be  integer 

multiples of a fundamental wavelength, the latter implies that the action along the path 

must  be  integer  multiples  of  the  action  quantum,  and  the  connection  of  the  two 

equations  bestows  a  geometrical  meaning

  The r is the radius of the Hubius Helix. Put n=1 for the fundamental wave.  

4.3. Compton Wavelength, Mass and Radius of the Electron  

Equation (3b) implies a geometric argument that the Hubius Helix must contain a whole 

wave of   4π periodicity, an argument akin to the original standing wave argument of de 

Broglie. To put the argument into the context of the electron, one starts withmc 2 = hν, 

combineλ=

, where V is the velocity of the wave (V = c , according to the postulate), 

and arrives at 

r

 through algebraic manipulation. It is noteworthy that the 

unspecified  wavelength  introduced  in  the  quantization  condition  turns  out  to  be  the 

V
ν

2
mc

=

c

π

12 

Compton  wavelength  of  the  electron.  The  radius  of  the  Hubius  Helix,  denoted  re 

hereafter, is defined as the radius of the electron.  

  The expression 

r

 has been assumed a priori or derived several times in the 

h=
2
mc

past.  (25,  33,  34)  Unfortunately,  it  was  not  accepted  unequivocally  as  the  radius  of  the 

electron. The facts that it can be derived from the quantization condition and that it does 

not contradict other attributes of the electron seem to justify its acceptance as the radius 

of the electron (the second fact will be shown in the proceeding subsections).  

4.4. The Spin  

An  orbital  motion  gives  rise  to  an  angular  momentum  by  definition  in  classical 

mechanics.  Following  the  notion  of  circular  motion,  the  spin  s,  is  identified  as  the 

orbital  angular  momentum  of  the  mass-less  particle  performing  circulatory  motion, 

thus:

4.5. The Magnetic Moment  

A current loop gives rise to a magnetic moment, or generally all magnetic fields are due 

to the motion of electric charges, according to Ampere’s hypothesis.  (6,  35) For a planar 

current loop, the magnitude of the magnetic moment isµ=

, where n is the number 

nIA
c

of  turns  of  the  loop,  I  is  the  current,  and  A  is  the  area  of  the  loop.  (36)  By  applying 

Ampere’s hypothesis to the postulated structure, and taking into account the fact that the 

two-turns suggests that n=2, one gets

  The spin and the magnetic moment are intricately connected in the understanding of 

the  electron. 

(37)  The  original  spinning  electron  hypothesis  was  deduced 

phenomenologically  to  account  for  the  anomalous  Zeeman  Effect  and  is  in  agreement 

13 

with  experiment.  (38,  39)  It  states  “An  electron  behaves  as  a  charged  particle  which  is 

rotating  around  an  axis  in  such  a  way,  that  it  possesses  an  angular  momentum  of 

1
constant absolute magnitude  h2

 around that axis and that it possesses at the same time 

a magnetic moment 

e
h  which has a direction opposite to the direction of the angular 
mc
2

momentum”. (39) By convention the direction of an electric current is opposite to that of 

the flow of the negative charge. According to this convention, the spin and the magnetic 

moment  derived  in  the  formulation  are  in  the  opposite  direction,  which  is  consistent 

with the spinning electron hypothesis. Furthermore, the formulation, an extension of the 

hypothesis, provides nothing but "such a way" that was left out in the spinning electron 

hypothesis.  

4.6. The Positron  

Dirac  predicted  that  in  addition  to  electrons  there  must  be  another  particle,  called 

positron  that  is  necessarily  related  to  the  electron.  (40)  The  positron  is  also  called  the 

antiparticle of the electron. The properties of a particle and its antiparticle obey certain 

rules  of  correspondence:  they  possess  an  equal  amount  of  energy  or  mass  and  the 

opposite charge. More importantly, when a particle and its antiparticle come together, 

they  can  annihilate  each  other  and  liberate  their  entire  mass  in  the  form  of  radiation 

energy, say γ-rays. In the case of an electron and a positron, the annihilation proceeds 

ase− + e+ = γ +γ' .  Conversely,  an  electron  and  a  positron  can  be  pair-produced 

following the reverse reaction. The rules of correspondence demand that an electron and 

a positron be treated on the same footing, i.e.  a theory applied to the electron should 

apply equally to the positron. (41) 

14 

 

If  I  am  to  formulate  the  positron  in  terms  of  Hubius  Helix  satisfying  the  rules  of 

correspondence between an electron and a positron, I am bound to identify one feature 

of the Hubius Helix to account for the equality in the mass of the electron and positron, 

another  feature  to  account  for  the  disparity in the charge of the electron and positron, 

and yet a mechanism for creation and annihilation of mass and charge to account for the 

creation and annihilation of an electron-positron pair. 

  According to the relation of the mass of the electron to the radius of curvature of the 

Hubius  Helix 

re

h=
mc
2

, the fact that an electron and a positron are of the same mass 

can  be  stated  equivalently  as  that  they  are  of  the  same  radius  of  curvature,  i.e.  if 

re

h=
2
mc

,  and 

re

h=+
2
mc

;  then 

 re = re+ .  Given  the  radius  of  curvature,  winding 

determines  a  Hubius  Helix  right-handed  or  left-handed:  the  right-hand  screw  winding 

results in a right-handed Hubius Helix, whereas the left-hand screw winding results in a 

left-handed Hubius Helix. A right-handed Hubius Helix cannot be congruent to a left-

handed Hubius Helix, except by a mirror reflection. Winding does not only determine 

the  parity  of  a  Hubius  Helix,  it  also  results  in  a  twist.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the 

magnitude  of  the  twist  depends  on  parameters  that  specify  the  details  of  the  winding, 

the  sign  of  a  twist  can  be  defined  positive/negative  with  respect  to  the  handedness  of 

winding.  Once  the  relation  of  the  parity  of  the  Hubius  Helix  to  the  sign  of  twist  is 

defined, a change in parity will necessarily lead to a change in the sign of the twist, and 

vise  versa.  Thus  the  disparity  in  the  charge  of  the  electron  and  positron  can  be 

connected to the parity or the sign of the twist of the Hubius Helix. This connection is 

qualitative  and  incomplete  in  character,  and  its  completeness  is  grounded  on  a 

15 

quantitative  relation  between  the  charge  and  the  magnitude  of  the  twist,  a  question 

concerning the origin of the charge and charge quantization (see subsection 4.10).  

  Following the curvature statement and the connection of the sign of the charge to the 

parity and the sign of the twist, the rules of correspondence of an electron to a positron 

can be formulated as such that an electron and a positron are two Hubius Helices of the 

same radius of curvature but opposite twist and parity. The annihilation is hence to be 

understood as unwinding of the two Hubius Helices of the same radius of curvature and 

the opposite parity and twist, whose consequence is the creation of two photons with the 

opposite  polarization.  Conversely,  the  pair  production  is  the  confinement  of  two 

photons in the form of Hubius Helix of the same radius of curvature and the opposite 

parity or twist. These geometrical rules of correspondence possess a beautiful feature in 

that an electron and a positron—two physical entities are unified to a single geometric 

entity.  

4.7. Hubius Helix and Dirac Electron  

A Dirac electron is the electron described by Dirac’s relativistic quantum theory of the 

electron.  The  Dirac  theory  of  the  electron  or  the  Dirac  equation  is  an  ingenious 

amalgamation of the special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics on the electron 

to  account  for  the  so-called  duplexity  phenomena  in  atomic  spectra  without  arbitrary 

assumption.  (16) In order for the theory to be compatible with both quantum mechanics 

and  the  special  theory  of  relativity,  the  requirements  of  the  general  schemes  of  both 

must  be  fulfilled.  For  quantum  mechanics  the  general  scheme  requires  that  only  first 

order derivatives with respect to time appear. On the other hand, the general scheme of 

relativity requires that the time and space co-ordinates be treated on the same footing. In 

satisfying  these  requirements,  the  introduction  of  Dirac’s  matrices  α   and  β   in  the 

16 

Hamiltonian

,  brought  about  “four  times  as  many  solutions  as  the 

non-relativity  wave  equation  and  twice  as  many  as  the  previous  relativity  wave 

equation”, which implies the existence of a new particle of positive elementary charge 

associated with the electron. (16) (It became known later that two solutions belong to an 

electron  in  its  two  spin  eigenstates,  and  two  belong  to  a  positron  in  its  two  spin 

eigenstates.). (42) When the motion of the electron in a central field was investigated, an 

extra  contribution  of 

  was  obtained  in  the  total  angular  momentum.  This  extra 

1
h2

contribution  was  interpreted  as  the  spin  angular  momentum  of  the  electron.  The 

magnetic  moment  terms  were  obtained  in  a  similar  way,  when  scalar  and  vector 

potentials  were  included  in  the  Hamiltonian.  Thus,  the  Dirac  theory  of  the  electron 

contains  many  new  features,  which  were  absent  in  previous  theories.  These  new 

features  in  turn  bestow  new  features  on  the  Dirac  electron.  The  Dirac  electron  is 

associated  with  an  anti-electron  of  positive  charge  in  such  a  way  that  the  two 

eigenstates of the spin of an electron and those of the anti-electron are to be described as 

four  components  of  one  entity  represented  by  a  column  matrix  of  four  elements.  A

  The  postulate  through  the  formulation  of  subsections  4.4,  4.5  and  4.6  provides  a 

description  of  the  electron  consistent  with  the  Dirac  theory,  by  providing  the  electron 

with  the  same  features  as  those  of  the  Dirac  electron:  a  spin 

  and  magnetic

features  are  revealed  through  algebraic  manipulation,  whereas  in  the  present 

17 

formulation,  these  features  appear  as  natural  consequences  of  the  topological  and 

geometrical  features  of  the  Hubius  Helix.  The  consistency  indicates  that  the  postulate 

contain  a  great  deal  of  truth.  Furthermore,  the  consistency,  if  reflecting  the  inner 

consistency  of  physical  laws,  should  no  doubt  lead  to  a  profound  connection  between 

the Dirac theory of the electron and the Hubius Helix. It turns out that such a connection 

is embedded in another feature of the Dirac theory, the spinor.  

  The  name  spinor  was  first  introduced  by  Ehrenfest. 

(43)  While  the  general 

mathematical form of spinors was discovered by E. Cartan, (44) it was the re-invention by 

Dirac  that  provided  the  first  indications  of  its  fundamental  importance  to  physics,  the 

four  wave  functions  in  the  Dirac  equation  being  only  the  components  of  a  spinor. 

However, it is believed that we have still not seen the full significance of spinors in the 

basic structure of physical laws. (45) Based on my recognition that a spinor changes sign 

when it completes a  π2  rotation and returns to its original position after  π4 rotation is 

exactly  the  property  that  a  Hubius  Helix  possesses,  (46)  and  that  the  components  of  a 

spinor  are  the  same  in  number  as  the  variants  of  a  Hubius  Helix  (each  handedness 

corresponding  to  two  spin  directions);  it  is  hereby  conjectured  that  the  structure  of  a 

spinor  is  the  Hubius  Helix.  Consequently,  the  Hubius  Helix  is  the  geometrical 

manifestation of the Dirac electron.  

4.8. Circular Motion and Zitterbewegung  

In examining the position and velocity operators associated with the Dirac equation in 

the  Heisenberg  representation,  E.  Schrödinger  found  that  the  eigenvalue  of  the  three 

space components of velocity operator  αrc

 could only take ±c (the same conclusion was 

reached  earlier  by  G.  Breit).  And  that  the  position  operator  consists  of  two  parts, 

18 

xk = ˜ x +ξk  in which  ˜ x = ak + c2 H −1pkt  and

the  kth  component  of  the  operators.  The  rectilinear  part  he  interpreted  as  the  position 

operator of the center-of-mass, whereas the resultant part he interpreted as the position 

operator  of  the  charge  in  the  rest  frame.  He  thus  concluded  that  the  motion  of  a  free 

Dirac  electron  consists  of  a 

rapidly  oscillatory  component—Zitterbewegung, 

superimposed on the average motion. (33) 

  The  Zitterbewegung,  as  a  concept  and  consequence  derived  from  the  Dirac  theory 

contains the following physical contents: the instantaneous velocity of the charge being 

always  c,  the  linear  dimension  (radius  to  be  exact)  of  the  charge  cloud  and  the 

characteristic  amplitude  of  the  Zitterbewegung  being

r

,  and  the  characteristic 

angular frequency of the Zitterbewegung being

z =ω

. The present author is aware 

of  the  point  of  view  that  when  the  Dirac  equation  is  interpreted  as  a  many-particle 

equation or a field equation, as the perception angle moved from describing the motion 

of  single  particle  to  quantizing  a  field,  as  the  picture  of  single  particle  disappears,  so 

does the manifestation of the Zitterbewegung. This point of view denies the existence of 

the Zitterbewegung. However, as Dirac argued “One must believe this consequence of 

the theory, since other consequences of the theory which are inseparably bound up with 

this  one,  such  as  the  law  of  scattering  of  light  by  an  electron,  are  confirmed  by 

experiment”.  (47)  In  spite  of  Dirac's  argument,  little  attention  has  been  given  over  the 

years to the physics of the Zitterbewegung.  

  Among  the  few  exceptional  cases  it  is  shown  that  Zitterbewegung  may  be  looked 

upon as a circular motion of the charge on the plane perpendicular to the direction of the 

h=
2
mc

19 

electron  spin  and  as  arising  from  the  superposition  of  the  positive  and  negative 

frequency components of the spinor. A positive or negative component alone does not 

produce a measurable effect of Zitterbewegung. (48) It was suggested that one distinguish 

two  reference  frames,  the  center-of-charge  and  the  center-of-mass.  (49-51)  When  the 

Zitterbewegung is identified with the motion of the charge relative to the center-of-mass 

rest  frame,  the  Hamiltonian  becomes Hr = mc 2β,  and  consequently  position,  velocity 

and momentum operators of the charge are identified with,

,  respectively.  (50,  51)  The  identification  clarifies  the  ambiguity  in 

describing  the  Zitterbewegung,  due  to  the  difference  in  definition  of  the  position 

operators. (52) Based on these results, (48-51) the pro Zitterbewegung view seems to make 

the  case  that  Zitterbewegung  is  a  self-consistent description of the dynamics of a free 

Dirac electron. 

  The fact that both the Zitterbewegung and the postulate require a mass-less particle 

performing circular motion at the velocity of c, lead to the same radius of the electron 

and therefore to the same angular frequency indicates that the dynamics entailed in the 

postulate is consistent with the dynamics of the Zitterbewegung.  

  Questions  arise 

immediately,  however,  when 

the  Zitterbewegung  frequency 

z =ω

 and the de Broglie frequency

d =ω

are put in juxtaposition. Can the de 

2

2mc

h

h

Broglie  frequency  be  identified  with  the  Zitterbewegung  frequency  as  found  in  the 

literature? (26, 27) If not, which is the characteristic frequency of the electron, if either? Or 

else, does the electron have two characteristic frequencies?  

20 

  The  consistency  between  the  Zitterbewegung  and  the  postulate  demands  the 

acceptance  of  the  Zitterbewegung  frequency  as  a  characteristic  frequency  of  the 

electron.  On  the  other  hand,  the  expression  for  the  de  Broglie  frequency—the  wave-

particle duality is physically valid in the broadest sense known. For these two reasons, 

one is compelled to accept a consequence that one and the same mass of the electron is 

associated  with  two  frequencies.  If  such  a  consequence  appears  perplexing  and 

irremediable  within  the  context  of  Zitterbewegung  and  wave-particle  duality,  it  is 

exactly  an  outcome  of  the  mathematical  structure  inherent  in  the  postulate—the 

frequency  condition  for  forming  a  closed  two-turn  helix,  as  exemplified  by 

 

 in an idealized two-dimensional case. To put the equations into the

the  line  spectrum  is  known  as  the  fine  structure  constant  after  Sommerfeld.  It  is  a 

fundamental  constant  in  the  physical  theories concerning electromagnetic interactions. 

(53)  The  uniqueness  of  αlies  in  the  fact  that  it  is  a  combination  of  three  fundamental 

physical  constants,  and  it  is  dimensionless.  In  spite  of  its  unique  position  and 

importance  in  the  physical  theories,  no  theory  forα  is  yet  available.  (53,  54)  It  is 

21 

maintained improbable that a theory for αcan be found before the new features in the 

description  of  nature,  due  to  a  fundamental  length  λassociated  with  elementary 

particles, have been clarified, features which at first have no connection at all with the 

question  of  the  electronic  charge.  (55)  The  λ,  as  a  natural  consequence  of  conjoining 

quantum mechanics and the special theory of relativity according to Heisenberg, cannot 

be  formed  dimensionally  from  h   and  c  should  instead  be  related  to  the  mass  of  the 

particle  in  the  form

m

.  And  its  relation  tor0 =

h∝
λc

e2
mc 2 ,  the  classical  radius  of  the 

electron  should  be  analogous  to  that  of  h  to h .  (55)  Being  a  dimensional  formula,  the 

expression  is  not  expected  to  produce  the  exact  value;  one  needs  a  numerical 

coefficient,  say  k  to  produce  equality.  In  other  words,  one  needs  a  physical  reason  to 

provide the coefficient. Following Heisenberg's profession as a guideline, however, one 

can  try  to  identify  what  is  the  fundamental  length  associated  with  the  electron  and  to 

find a way leading toα. One can identify 

 withλ, and get k=1/2. It seems that 

re

h=
mc

re is the fundamental length Heisenberg anticipated, but it does not bring α into being. 

One can identify, r0 withλ, and get

k

=

α=

. Combining the result of the two trials, a 

new  expression  for  α  is  foundα=

.  It  is  indeed  an  association  of  fundamental 

length(s)  with  the  elementary  particle,  the  electron  in  this  case.  The  new  expression

  can  also  be  obtained  by  identifying  the  rest  energy  of  the  electron  with  the 

Coulomb  energy  of  the  classical  electronmc 2 =

,  and  substituting  m  with

h .  The 
ecr2

connotation  of  the  first  step  is  that  the  electron  mass  is  electromagnetic  in  origin  in  a

sense  of  classical  electrodynamics,  and  the  connotation  of  the  second  step  is  the 

acceptance of re as the fundamental length. In spite of the connotations, the essence of 

the new expression for α remains the ratio of two lengths associated with the electron. 

It should be noted, however, that while re represents the radius of the Hubius Helix, r0 

does  not  have  a  geometrical  meaning  associated  with  the  Hubius  Helix.  It  is  not 

unreasonable to assert that if one can identify the association of r0 and the Hubius Helix, 

one is in a good position to account forαgeometrically. "It seems hopeless to attack this 

problem [to obtain a theory of electrons which fixes the value of

] from the physical 

2

point of view, as one has no clue to what new physical ideas are needed. However, one 

can be sure that the new theory must incorporate some very pretty mathematics, and by 

seeking  this  mathematics  one  can  have  some  hope  of  solving  the  problem."  (22) 

Following Dirac's line of reasoning one ought to seek for the right mathematical content 

of the Hubius Helix.  

 

It is important to note that the formulation outlined so far has dealt implicitly in two-

dimensions  with  the  radius,  the  periodicity  and  the  frequencies  of  the  circulatory 

motion. In other words, it has dealt with the topological aspect of the Hubius Helix and 

its one homotopy of a constant radius in two dimensions. The natural extension of the 

formulation is therefore to examine the Hubius Helix in three-dimensions.  

 

In doing so, I did not fail to perceive that the surface bounded by a Hubius Helix is in 

fact a Möbius strip  (56)—a one-sided non-orientable surface discovered by J. B. Listing 

and A. F. Möbius independently in 1858, and that the edge of a Möbius strip is a Hubius 

Helix. Such a coupled double perception (CDP) or visual dichotomy manifests itself as 

ambiguous figures in the worlds of art and cognitive sciences. (57) Well-known examples 

23 

are  the  Necker  Cube,  where  the  CDP  is  produced  by  perspective  reversal;  Rubbin's 

Reversible Goblet, where the CDP is produced by figure-ground reversal; and Hill's My 

Wife and My Mother-in-law, where the CDP is produced by rival-schemata reversal. It 

is  worth  emphasizing  that  the  Möbius  strip-Hubius  Helix  dichotomy  is  beyond  these 

categories  of  reversal.  It  is  boundary-the  enclosed  reversal  that  produces  the  CDP.  In 

spite  of  the  ambiguity  in  perception,  in  many  instances,  the  contents  of  ambiguous 

figures  can  be  stated  unambiguously  in  terms  of  mathematics.  As  in  the  case  of  the 

Möbius  strip-Hubius  Helix  dichotomy,  the  Möbius  strip  as  a  surface  is  most  simply 

represented 

in 

terms 

of 

two 

real 

parameters ρand  ϕ 

as 

follows: 

x = (a − ρsin

ϕ)cosϕ

 

y = (a − ρsin

. (58)

For a given constant a,  ρ < a determines the width of the Möbius strip in the concrete 

description of each homotopy. On the other hand, the Hubius Helix as a space curve can 

be  concretely  described  by  the  same  equations  in  terms  of  only  one  real  parameter ϕ 

with a and  ρas constants. It seems that the Möbius strip as a non-orientable surface and 

non-trivial fiber-bundles has caught considerable attention in mathematics and physics, 

(59) and that its edge as a space curve has been overlooked, if not totally ignored. (60) 

  Thus, by examining the Hubius Helix in three dimensions, the relation between the 

Hubius  Helix  and  the  Möbius  strip  was  found,  and  a  new  length  ρwas  introduced, 

which defines the spacing between the two turns of the Hubius Helix. In addition, it is 

observed  that  while  different  topological  objects  may  share  the  same  concrete 

description,  the  same  topological  object  can  have  completely  different  concrete 

24 

descriptions.  It  is  therefore  anticipated  that  one  of  the  concrete  descriptions  of  the 

Hubius Helix be able to further relate re or r0 to  ρand thereby to incorporate αinto the 

postulated structure.  

 

In subsection 4.5, the magnetic moment of the electron was expressed as  µe = ere  in 

the  idealized  two-dimensional  case.  In  the  three-dimensional  case,  the  instantaneous 

radius  of  the  circular  motion  is  a  periodic  function  of  time  or  phase  according 

tor = x2 + y2 + z 2 .  Thus,  the  measured  radius  should  be  the  mean  value  of  the 

instantaneous  radii  over  the  interval  of  4π  according  to

r

dθ.  The  measured

consequently the αcan be interpreted geometrically as the ratio of the half (full) width 

to the radius (diameter) of the Hubius Helix. Thus, the present formulation has provided 

a  geometric  interpretation  of  the  fine  structure  constant  and  the  anomalous  magnetic 

moment,  bestows  an  explicit  geometrical  meaning  on  the  classical  radius  of  the

4.10. Charge as a Geometrical Attribute of the Hubius Helix 

The  charge  as  a  physical  attribute  of  an  elementary  particle  concerns  the  following 

fundamental  aspects.  There  are  two  types  of  charge  in  nature  assigned  positive  and 

negative,  and  the  charge  attached  to  a  particular  elementary  particle  has  a  constant 

numerical  value  in  a  given  system  of  units  of  physics.  The  effort  to  understand  the 

definite  value  of  the  charge—charge  quantization  has  followed  at  least  two  major 

routes,  the  magnetic  monopole  approach  and  flux  quantization  approach.  (40,  62)  The 

26 

former approach, with the initial intention of looking for some explanation of

137

, 

ch
2 ≈
e

leads  to  a  concept  of  magnetic  monopole  that  sets  up  a  quantization  condition  for  the 

charge. The state of affairs is best described in Dirac's own words: "If there exists any 

monopole at all in the universe, all electric charges would have to be such that e times 

this monopole strength is equal to

."(63). The introduction of the monopole was not 

1
cnh2

considered a complete solution of the problem of charge quantization, for it could not 

fix any value for e.  (63) As for the latter approach it is not clear as to which of the two 

concepts, the charge quantization or the flux quantization, is the primary concept.  

  Now

its  geometrical  meaning

well.  To  render  the  charge  a  geometrical  attribute,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  some 

geometric  feature  of  the  Hubius  Helix  with  the  charge.  In  order  to  do  so,  the  Hubius 

Helix needs to be further examined in a deeper mathematical sense.  

 

In geometry a space curve is characterized by three variables, the linking number Lk, 

the  writhing  number  Wr,  and  the  total  twist  number  Tn,  which  are  related 

through  Wr = Lk − Tn .  (64,  65) The Lk is a topological property, whereas the Wr and the Tn 

are metrical properties. If a strip S(X, U) is defined as a smooth curve X together with a 

smoothly varying unit vector U(t) perpendicular to X at each point, and 

1ω  is defined as 

the twist of the strip at each point of the curve 

, where the δφ is the angular

sδ apart  along  the  strip;  the  total  twist  of  the  strip  is  defined  as 

Tw( X ,U ) = Tw ≡ ω1∫
    

ds , and the total twist number 

.  (65) (What applies to a strip

does apply to an elastic rod or string, when the strip is considered as the generator of the 

latter.  See  also  L.  D.  Landau  and  E.  M.  Lifshitz,  Theory  of  Elasticity,  Volume  7  of 

Course of theoretical Physics, Pergamon Press, London, 1959pp. 65-66, where the same 

quantity  is  called  torsion  angle.)  Following  Fuller's  definition,  F.  Crick  worked  out  a 

formula  for  calculating  the  total  twist  of  a  ribbon  wound  on  a  cylinder  and  going  N 

times,     Tw = N sinδ, where δ is the pitch angle of the helix. (66) Applying this formula to 

the  homotopy  of  the  Hubius  Helix  employed  in  subsection  4.9.,  a  circular-cross-

sectioned  wire  being  wound  on  a  cylinder,  going  round  two  times  in  a  right-handed 

helix, and joining the ends, we getTw = 2sinδ. For a small pitch angle, as in the present

Hubius Helix. The disparity in the sign of the twist can therefore be identified with that 

in  the  sign  of  charge  in  the  electron  and  the  positron.  Hence  the  twist  reduced  the 

charge—a  physical  attribute  of  the  electron  to  a  geometrical  attribute  of  the  Hubius 

Helix. At the same time, it bestows a geometric meaning for the coupling constant

4.11. Mass as a Geometrical Attribute of the Hubius Helix 

From the physical point of view, as a consequence of conjoining the special theory of 

relativity and quantum mechanics through the Hubius Helix the mass of an electron is 

related to the radius of the electron,

. This relation resembles that of curvature 

and the radius of curvature of a plane curve,κ=

. The two relations become identical 

under  the  conditions  c = 1  and

1

.  The  conditions  are  not  at  all  unreasonable,  but

rooted  on  sound  physical  basis,  the  former  as  result  of  treating  space  and  time  on  the 

same footing and the latter as result of choosing the electron's action as the basic unit of 

action.  

  Thus, from the mathematical point of view, under a suitable choice of the system of 

units, mass is analogous, if not identical, to curvature. The attempt to identify mass with 

curvature makes physical sense in two ways. For the first, the more massive the particle, 

the smaller the particle, and the more curved the space near the particle. For the second, 

a  particle  of  zero  mass  like  the  photon  travels  in  a  straight  line.  Upon  accepting  this 

identification, the origin of mass can be understood as action in a curved space.  

4.12. Certain Transformation Properties of the Hubius Helix 

Physical  laws  expressed  in  terms  of  a  system  of  equations  of  space  time  variables 

necessarily  possess/lack  certain  transformation  properties  or  symmetries,  for  instance 

being invariant/variant under translation or rotation with respect to a certain coordinate 

system. The general transformation properties of the Hubius Helix shall be worked out 

in a separate occasion by treating the Hubius Helix as a dynamic system, and examining 

such  a  system  represented  in  Hamiltonian  or  Lagrangian  form  undergone  proper 

Lorentz  transformations  (i.e.,  continuous  Lorentz  transformations  that  involve  neither 

space  nor  time  inversions).  Before  this  is  done,  it  is  possible  to  work  out  the 

transformation  properties  of  the  Hubius  Helix  undergone  three  important  discrete 

transformations,  charge  conjugation  (C),  space  inversion  or  parity  (P),  and  time 

inversion (T) and the combinations thereof to examine the relation between the electron 

and positron in particular, and matter antimatter in general.  

  The geometrical rules of correspondence of the electron to the positron formulated in 

subsection 4.6., the identification of the charge to the twist, and the connection of the 

29 

sign of the twist to the parity of a Hubius Helix imply an association of charge with the 

parity  (i.e.,  when  the  parity  of  the  Hubius  Helix  changes,  the  sign  of  the  twist  is 

reversed,  and  vise  versa).  Thus  C  and  P  merge  to  an  inseparable  transformation 

(denoted  as  CP  with  the  underline  to  emphasize  the  inseparability).  However,  the  T 

transformation  remains  an  independent  one.  The  results  of  {CP,  T,  CPT,  TCP} 

transformations can be envisaged on the electron and positron at their respective spin up 

and  down 

states   (eu

− ,ed

− ,eu

+,ed

+) .  CP 

changes 

the 

electron/positron 

to 

the 

positron/electron,  but  keeps  the  spin  orientation  unchanged.  T  does  not  change  the 

electron/positron to the positron/electron, but reverses the orientation of the spin. CPT 

changes the electron/positron to the positron/electron, as well as the orientation of the 

spin.  CPT  and  TCP  are  commutative  transformations.  These  results  indicate  that  the 

matter antimatter worlds as represented by the electron (left-handed L) and the positron 

(right-handed R) are governed by rules   R ≠ L, R ≠ L , but   R  = L, R = L .  

4.13. The Dimension of the Electron in Particle Physics Perspective  

It is a general belief that the electron is a point-like particle with almost no measurable 

dimensions,  and  that  the  electron  does  not  possess  any  sub-constituent.  This  belief  is 

largely  based  on  the  results  of  Møller  and  Bhabha  scattering,  obtained  from  many 

experiments  performed  in  the  last  twenty  years  at  PETRA  (Positron-Electron  Tandem 

Ring Accelerator Facility at DESY laboratory in Hamburg), PEP(The Positron-Electron 

Project, a collaborative effort of SLAC and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory), TRISTAN 

(The e+e- Collider at National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, KEK in Japan), and 

LEP (The Large Electron Positron Collider at CERN). In the experiments conducted at 

PEP in the tests of leptonic substructure, Bender et al. stated "experimentally there is no 

indication  that  the  electron  has  structure  [composite  of  more  fundamental  particles]. 

30 

Lower limits for cutoff parameters are in the 100—200 GeV range, corresponding to an 

electron size of less than 10-16 cm. Therefore, if the electron is a composite particle its 

constituents  are  strongly  bound,  giving  the  electron  the  observed  point-like  quality  at 

experimentally accessible energies." (67) As a matter of fact the results obtained from the 

scattering experiments have been a "no-go" sign to any attempt of the so called large-

electron  theories,  where  the  size  of  the  electron  was  in  an  order  of  its  Compton 

wavelength. (11) The present work, where the electron is formulated as having a defined 

structure,  characteristic  dimensions,  and  no  substructure,  does  not  receive  any 

exception—the  dimension  of  the  electron  inferred  from  those  experiments  is  several 

orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  radius  of  the  electron  derived  from  the  present 

work

  This apparent discrepancy presents a grave challenge to the present work. How can 

such  a  large  electron  manifest  such  a  small  size  in  scattering?  Or,  why  the  scattering 

experiments reveal a point-like particle, if the size of the electron is in an order of its 

Compton wavelength? In order to answer these questions, let us examine what happens, 

when  a  particle  is  moving  at  high  energy.  First  of  all,  when  a  particle  is  at  rest,  it 

possesses  rest  energy    E = mc2 .  When  it  is  moving,  its  total  energy  becomes 

E = mc2 (

)  or 

its  mass  becomes

m' = m(

) ,  according 

to 

the 

relativistic  dynamics.  The  change  in  mass  may  result  in  either  "a  point  of  view"  that 

although  the  particle  becomes  heavier  as  it  moves,  it  is  still  the  same  particle,  or  "a 

point  of  view"  that  since  the  particle  is  heavier  as  it  moves,  it  has  become  another 

31 

particle.  Based on the first "point of view", the formula 

r

 derived in the present

work suggests that for a given particle as the mass of the particle increases, the size of 

the particle decreases. Based on the second "point of view" the formula suggests that for 

different  particles  the  heavier  the  particle,  the  smaller  the  dimension.  Combining 

    E = mc2  and

. This relation demonstrates how a Compton-

sized electron manifests a point-like particle in scattering experiments, and provides the 

reason  why  high  energy  scattering  reveals  the  electron  as  a  point-like  particle. 

According to this relation, when an electron is accelerated to the energy of 100 GeV or 

200 GeV, its diameter has diminished to 1.97×10-16 cm or 0.99×10-16 cm respectively. 

These  values  agree  well  with  the  dimension  of  the  electron  inferred  from  the  high 

energy scattering experiments. (67)  

 

5. REFURBISHMENT OF THE POSTULATE 

From the original postulate put forward in section 3 that the topological structure of the 

electron  is  a  closed  two-turn  helix  (a  so-called  Hubius  Helix)  that  is  generated  by 

circulatory  motion  of  a  mass-less  particle  at  the  speed  of  light,  a  system  of 

parameterized equations emerged. With the help of the concepts in the classical physics, 

the  equations  tie  together  most,  if  not  all,  attributes  of  the  electron,  particularly  the 

anomalous magnetic moment:

6.1. Issues Inherent in the Point-like Electron  

That electrons are point-like particles has been a statement in perhaps all occasions of 

the  description  of  the  electrons  as  elementary  or  fundamental  particles.  However,  to 

accept the statement as a concept, one must choose to live with certain issues inherent in 

the concept.  

 

"The self-energy of the electron has been an embarrassment for almost a century, and 

in a sense for longer than there have been authentic electrons (first demonstrated by J. J. 

Thomson  in  1901)  and  for  far  longer  than  physics  has  been  complicated  (but,  some 

would  say,  simplified)  by  quantum  mechanics.  For  if  electrons  are  strictly  point-like 

object, their self-energy, most simply taken as their potential energy in the electric field 

they  carry,  must  be  infinite.  …  People  like  H.  A.  Lorentz  were  well  aware  of  the 

difficulty. … In itself, that would be no great scandal, even if electrons were point-like 

entities,  for  the  absolute  value  of  a  potential  energy  is  unimportant.  But  by  1905, 

33 

Einstein  had  sharpened  the  dilemma  by  demonstrating  the  equivalence  of  energy  and 

mass.  How,  then  to  escape  from  the  conclusion  that  a  point-like  electron  should  have 

infinite  mass?"  (68)  (My  Italics)  The  scope  of  the  issues  was  expanded,  when  the  spin 

and the magnetic moment were assigned to the electrons  (38), for there is no room in a 

point-like electron to accommodate for such a large magnetic moment, and the magnetic 

self-energy associated with it.(69)  

 

It  is  believed  that  a  finite  electron  is  the  most  natural  concept  that  makes  the  total 

energy  of  the  Coulomb  field  of  the  electron  finite  (24),  therefore  a  way  out  of  the 

dilemma.  

  Now that a finite structure has been postulated with the consequences being worked 

out,  the  dilemma  should  be  resolved.  Concerning  the  relation  of  the  Coulomb  self-

energy  and  the  rest  energy, 

= mc 2   was  already  justified  in  subsection  4.10. 

e 2

Concerning the relation of the Coulomb self-energy and the magnetic self-energy, it is 

rather straightforward to show that the electric field is indeed equal in magnitude to the 

magnetic  field,

relation  was  derived  a  long  time  ago,  though  the  problem  was  formulated  in  reverse 

order.  (34) The relations,

consistent description of the finite self-energy to finally resolve the issue of infinite self-

has led to a finite rest mass. Furthermore, the 

re

relation  of  the  radius  to  the  relativistic  mass  as  formulated  in  subsection  4.13  should 

lead to the account for the Lorentz contraction.  

34 

6.2. Other Kinds of Particles 

One  does  not  distinguish  particles  from  antiparticles  when  counting  the  kinds  of 

particles.  Following  this  convention,  one  includes  antiparticles  when  discussing  the 

particles in general. In section 4, the physical attributes of the electron, including mass, 

charge  and  spin  were  formulated  in  terms  of  geometrical  and  topological attributes of 

1
the postulated structure, the Hubius Helix; for instance, the spin  h2

 as the consequence 

of  π4 periodicity, charge as the consequence of twist, and mass as the consequence of 

curvature.  Thus,  particles  of  the  same  geometrical/topological  attributes  may  be 

classified as the same kind or put into the same geometrical/topological class. Fermions 

with s=1/2, m≠0, and charge e may be considered as one class— Hubius Helices of the 

same  twist  but  different  radii,  whereas  massive  bosons  with  s=1,  m≠0,  and  charge=0 

may be considered as another geometrical class—circles of different radii. In addition, 

photons  with  charge=0,  m=0  can  be  considered  as  yet  another  class—strings  of  zero 

curvature.  In  this  classification  regime,  a  muon  and  an  electron,  which  have  identical 

properties  except  for  mass  and  life  time,  belong  to  the  same  geometrical/topological 

class.  The  applicability  of  the  classification  regime  is  affirmed  in  the  case  of  the 

electron and the muon by the fact that the formulation applied to the electron is equally 

applicable to the muon before it decays, provided that αis kept the same for the muon 

as  for  the  electron.  However,  for  protons  the  compound  nature  and  large  anomalous 

magnetic moment seem to suggest a quite different class of geometric structure.  

35 

6.3. The Physical Constants and Physical Theories, Fundamental Length, and the 

Constants of Nature  

Physics with experiment and theory as its fundamental components deals with physical 

quantities in practice. A physical quantity is said to be a physical constant, if it is time 

invariant, in spite of its varied numerical value in different systems of units. A physical 

constant is further said to be fundamental or universal, if it is universally invariant, that 

is  if  it  is  not  too  specific,  too  closely  associated  with  the  particular  properties  of  the 

material  or  system  upon  which  the  measurements  are  carried  out.  The  Fundamental 

Physical  Constants  compiled  by  CODATA  appear  to  bear  such  quality.  (70)  The 

importance  of  the  fundamental  constants  lies in the fact that they, through association 

with  physical  theories,  constitute  to  a  varied  extent  a  unified  description  of  nature  or 

natural phenomena.  

  However,  their  association  with  the  respective  physical  theories  does  not  seem  to 

indicate  that  they  are  all  equally  fundamental.  Furthermore,  the  interplay  between 

experimental and theoretical physics on the physical quantities does indicate that they 

are  inter-expressible.  These  led  to  a  speculation  fifty  years  ago  that  in  a  complete 

physical  theory  all  the  constants  would  be  expressible  in  terms  of  only  four  basic 

constants:  the  Boltzmann's  constant  kB,  the  speed  of  light  c  (the  Einstein's  constant, 

following  a  recent  proposal  of  Kenneth  Brecher  of  Boston  University),  the  Planck's 

constant  h,  and  the  elementary  length  λ,  “the  quadrumvirate  of  complete  physical 

theory” according to Gamow, (71) or “universal constants of the first kind” according to 

Heisenberg. (55) While kB is responsible for the connection between isolated entities and 

their ensemble, the rest are concerned with the so called microphysics. Being 'universal 

constants of the first kind', h and c share the virtue that they emerge as a consequence of 

36 

conjoining  physical  theories,  they  are  of  pivotal  importance  in  the  new  theories,  and 

they  designate  the  limits  in  whose  proximity  our  intuitive  concepts  can  no  longer  be 

used  without  misgivings.  c  is  a  consequence  of  conjoining  Newtonian  mechanics  and 

the  Maxwell  theory,  reflects  the  relation  between  the  time-component  and  space-

components  of  the  four-Minkowski  space,  appears  as  a  constant  in  the  basic  equation 

E = mc 2   on  which  the  special  theory  of  relativity  rests,  and  designates  the  highest 

possible value of any physical velocity. h is a consequence of conjoining the statistical 

theory  of  heat  and  the  Maxwell  theory,  appears  as  a  constant  in  the  basic  equation 

E = hν on which quantum mechanics rests, and designates the smallest possible value 

of  action  concerning  absorption-radiation  process.  Unlike  h  and  c,  the  fundamental 

length does not have an association with existing fundamental theories as such, and the 

argument  for  its  inclusion  in  the  complete  physical  theory  was  mainly  based  on 

dimension analysis and the fact that a length is a basic measure in physics.  (55,  71) The 

argument is as follows: there must exist [besides h and c] another 'universal constant of 

the first kind' having the dimension of a length or a mass, for a length or mass cannot be 

formed  dimensionally  from  h  and  c.  And  the  physical  significance  of  this  constant  is 

expressed more clearly by introducing it as a fundamental length.  

  The  introduction  of  the  fundamental  length  to  physics  in  some  natural  way  was 

considered one of the problems in the post-relativity and quantum mechanics physics. 

(72) And the discussion of questions associated with it appears to be the most urgent task. 

(55) But eventually “How this new constant of elementary length can be introduced into 

the  existing  formalism  of  physical  theory  is,  of  course,  anybody's  guess.”  (71)  In 

analyzing the relation between the fundamental constants and physical theories, it was 

envisioned  that  “when  quantum  theory  and  relativity  wave  theory  are  conjoined, 

37 

account must be taken of a universal constant having the dimension of a length.” (55) In 

other  words,  the  emergence  of  the  fundamental  length  ought  to  be  a  consequence  of 

conjoining quantum theory and relativity theory.  

  The identification of the radius of the electron re with the fundamental lengthλseems 

to be a natural way to introduce the fundamental length to physics, and a fulfillment of 

Heisenberg's  vision  and  Gamow's  speculation;  for  re  emerges  as  a  consequence  of 

conjoining quantum mechanics and relativity theory. It is of pivotal importance in the 

whole formulation as seen through the relation between the mass and the radius of the 

electron and the relation between the radius and the classical radius of the electron—the 

geometrical  account  forαand  the  electronic  charge.  Furthermore,  it,  together  with  r0 

designates  the  geometrical  constraints  that  underlie  the  physical  attributes  of  the 

electron. The fundamental length of other elementary particles is likely to be the same 

as  the  mass—all  possess  the  same  measure,  but  each  has  its  own  value.  Thus,  the 

fundamental length, as a basic measure of the elementary constituent of matter, deserves 

a position of being 'universal constant of the first kind' just like  h and c in relation to 

physical  theories,  or  a  position  in  Gamow's  quadrumvirate.  I  would  vote  Boltzmann's 

constant kB, Einstein's constant c, Planck's constant h, and the radius of the electron re, 

(why not call it Hubius constant?) for the constants of nature.  

 

7. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

The fundamental ways of describing phenomena in nature are based on the concepts of 

particle, field, wave, and string  ‡. These concepts foster powerful physical theories on 

the  one  hand,  and  constitute  different  philosophical  views  of  the  physical  universe  on 

the other. The concept of massive point particles— being introduced as an abstraction 

38 

of macroscopic objects in mechanical motion where the internal structure of the objects 

can  be  totally  ignored—evolved  into  what  is  called  the  particle  view,  fostered 

Newtonian  mechanics,  Maxwell-Boltzmann's  theory  of  heat,  and  led  ultimately  to  the 

concept  of  elementary  particles.  The  concept  of  lines  of  force—being  conceived  to 

visualize  the  medium,  through  which  electromagnetic  forces  propagate—evolved  into 

the field view, fostered the theories of electromagnetism of Faraday, Maxwell and Hertz 

and  Einstein's  field  theory  of  gravitation,  and  led  ultimately  to  the  concept  of  unified 

field theories. The concept of wave-particle duality—being derived from the undulation 

and corpuscular nature of light and matter—evolved into the wave-particle or quantum 

field  view,  fostered  the  wave  mechanics  and  quantum  field  theories,  and  led  to  the 

concept  of  the  grand  unification—the  unified  quantum  field  theory  of  elementary 

particles and interactions.  

  While  the  particles,  fields,  and  waves  at  the  present  stage  of  their  development  are 

truly  abstract  representation  in  nature;  the  Hubius  Helix  postulated  above  portrays  an 

intuitive  picture  for  the  electron.  As  demonstrated  in  the  previous  sections,  the  Helix 

allows us to apply classical concepts to it. With help of these concepts, it reproduced the 

static and dynamic spectroscopic properties of the electron. The very virtue of the Helix 

lies in the fact that a single piece of mathematical fact is able to tie together all of the 

attributes of the electron identified in Section 1.  

  With respect to the relation to the philosophical views, the Helix defies the particle 

view, so far as the electron is concerned. It is consistent with the wave-particle view, for 

the  formulation  and  the  wave  mechanics  share  the  same  starting  point,  the  same 

standing  wave  argument  for  quantization,  and  obtained  the  same  wavelength-

momentum  relation  for  the  electron.  As  the  present  work  limited  itself  within  the 

39 

context  of  the  electron  as  an  isolated  entity,  the  discussion  of  possible  impact  of  the 

present work on the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics is not intended. As 

for the field view, in spite of the relation between the Hubius Helix and the Möbius strip 

or non-trivial fiber-bundles that are closely connected to gauge field, (73) the formulation 

of  the  mathematical  relation  between  the  Hubius  Helix  and  the  gauge  field  is  not 

attempted.  

  To  conclude,  the  present  work—as  the  result  of  an  endeavour  of  a  historical, 

physical,  mathematical,  and  philosophical  study  of  the  electron  as  concept,  isolated 

entity  and  theories—is  a  manifest  of  my belief in Einstein's conviction "You know, it 

would be sufficient to really understand the electron." (74)

Footnotes: 

† This pullet is different from the rest ones in that it does not imply the Zitterbewegung 

as a well established concept or basis of the argument in the present paper rather as a 

mathematical  consequence  of  the  Dirac  equation  derived  from  a  particular  viewing 

angle,  whose  physical  existence  and  interpretation  are  debatable  even  to  the  present 

day. And our understanding of it is still far from complete.   

¶ The formulation does not treat the electron in conventional mechanical terms like in 

Newtonian  mechanics,  where  all  forces  exerted  on  the  object  concerned  are  identified 

and  put  into  the  Newton  equation  in  order  to  find  the  equation  of  motion;  nor  like  in 

Hamilton  mechanics  or  Lagrange  mechanics,  where  the  dynamical  variables  are 

defined,  and  the  Hamiltonian  or  Lagrangian  of  the  system  is  put  into  the  respective 

equations  in  order  to  find  the  equation  of  motion.  Instead,  the  formulation  treats  the 

electron as a space time structure by accepting the attributes of the electron (enlisted in 

section  1)  as  facts  and  correlating  them  to  the  geometrical  or  topological  attributes  of 

the  space  time  structure.  As  consequence  of  such  an  approach,  the  framework  of  the 

paper, even if it can be tentatively defined as the space time structure, seems somewhat 

ambiguous,  and  some  equations  cited  appear  out  of  context.  Since  one  of  the 

expectations of the paper is to provide a foundation on which improved understanding 

of the electron can be built, the acceptance of the present framework or the emergence 

of a new framework and proper context is left to the future development on the basis of 

this paper.

‡  The  relevance  of  the  string  to  the  Hubius  Helix  seems  somewhat  questionable, 

therefore the relation between the string and the Hubius Helix, and between the string 

theories and the present work will not be discussed.

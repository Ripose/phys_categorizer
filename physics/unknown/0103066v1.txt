The  Fundamental  wave  equation  [Chechelnitsky,  1980],  described  of  Solar  system    (similarly  to  the  atom 
system),  separates  the  spectrum  of  physically  distinguished,  stationary  -  elite  -  orbits,  corresponding  to  mean 
quantum numbers N, including the spectrum of permissible elite velocities vN.

Quantization of Circulation and Velocity. 

We  once  more  repit  in  the  compact  form  the  important  conclusion  which  was  obtained  in  the  monograph 

(Chechelnitsky, 1980) and repeatedly underlined afterwards.

Universality of Observed,  
Physically Distinguished Velocities 

From the point of view of experimental investigations of real systems of Universe the Law of Universality of Elite 

(Dominant) velocities may be briefly formulated as follows 

Proposition (Universality of Elite –  
(Dominant) Velocities in Universe). 
# Detectable in experiments and observations velocities of real systems of Universe - from objects of microworld 
(subatomic  physics)  to  objects  of  megaworld  -  astronomical  systems  -  with  the  most  probability  belong  to  the 
Universal Spectrum of elite (dominant) velocities of Universe. 

# This Universal Spectrum of Velocities in the sufficient approximation may be represented in the form:

Once more let pay our attention to the hierarchy of sound velocities, that is definded by the recurrence relation 

[s]

C*

[1]

           s=...,-2,-1,0,1,2,... 

In  view of its special important significance and possibility of following generalizations we will to name  it "The 
General  Homological  Series  (GHS)  of  sound  velocities".    By  the  quality  of  generative  member  in  that  series 
essentially it is used, for instance, the

significent arguments for existance  of  Shell  structure, hierarchy and similarity - dynamical isomorphysm - of Solar

essentially, the same. 

It  may  be  show  by  "appearance  order"  (i.e.  by  justified,  convincing  consequences),  that  such  mass  is mp  (the 
-meson)  or  M2p=2mp  mass  of  Di-proton  (or  Deuteron).  In  terms  of  unique Homological series - that is, 

Di-proton (Deuteron) and pion (p

 - meson) belong to the same (General) Homological series  (GHS), in other 

words, its generate the same General Homology of masses.  

Each of its may be considered as primary-image (eponim) of Homological series. 
This affirmation may be convinced to true immediately.  
We have, according to [RPP], for Di - proton mass 

M2p = 2mp = 2· 938.27231 = 1876.5446 Mev/c

2
 

and for p

 - meson (pion) mass 

the ratio 

mp  = 139.56995 Mev/c

M2p/mp  = 13.44519 = c 2
. 

The following from that quantity value c  = 3.666(7684) coinsides with standard, accepted value of c  = 3.66(6) - 

Fundamental parameter of hierarchy (FPH). 

This result may be also considered as one of possible experimental determination of c  - FPH (in microworld).

Once more we point importance of the following observation. 
Proposition 
# Masses of mp  pion, m2p Di-proton and value of c  FPH are connected (group together) by the following relation  

M2p/mp  =2mp/mp =13.44519 = c 2
. 

# That relation in some specific sense may be considering as experimental definition of c  FPH . 
It will be good for consequent calculations the following relation between mp and me. 
Proposition 
# By using equation

Thus,  the  following  assertions  open  possibilities  of  the  wide  using  of mass spectrum representation in various

Mistery of muon. 

The physical nature of muon, latent sense of it existence, it's true status in theoretical physics lies in the center 
of  attention  at  even  many  decades.  That  is  how  this  that  problem  is  sounded  by  Nobel    Prizer  M.Perl  [Perl, 
1995(1996)]:  "There  are  two  puzzles,  connected  with  electron  and  muon.  The  first  puzzle:  ...  properties  of  these 
particles relate to interactions the same, but the muon at 206,8 times more heavy. Why? 

The  second  puzzle  was  connected  with  that  muon  is  not  stable  and  desintegrate  (decay)  by  the  time  2,2(cid:215) 10-6

In reality that expression is continued the tradition which exist (before) him. In the frame of discussed approach 
it  may  be  discovered,  that  "experimental"  value  of  N  quantum  number  in  the  G[0]  Shell  for  the  observed mass of

Alternative Aspect of Z0 Gauge Boson 

[1]

According to RPP, Z0 gauge boson has the mass  

m(Z0)= 91.187–  0.007 Gev/c2 

Its charge is equal to zero. 
# From the point of view of discussed here approach WU Concept it is not difficult to prove in validity of following 

relations  

M = c 5m(p 0) = 3.66665(cid:215) 134.9764 = 89457.136 Mev/c2 
) = 3.66665(cid:215) 139.56995 = 92501.56 Mev/c2 
M = c 5m(p

As it is easily seen, Z0 boson mass lies in the interval (range) between these calculated values. 
So, it may be concluded follow 
Proposition. 
# In the principal aproximation the mass of Z0 heavy boson is represented in form 
M = c 5mp  = c 3 2mp = 92506.67Mev/c2=92.506Gev/c2

# Heavy W

Genesis,  sense,  significance  of  that  astonishing,  mysterious  Invariant  in  Universe  may  be  represented  as  the 

object of special examination. 

There are immence amount of evident and less evident consequances, effects, associations, continuations, that

to  present  its  in  all  totality,  at  once,  simultaneously.  We  hope,  its  will  make  up  the  object  of  consequent 
publications.  
 
DISCUSSION 
 

Main ideas and results of discussed aproach are obtained by author long ago. 
Its for a long time kept lie, subjected to the critical analysis, comprehend, overgrowning by details and by more 

convinced argumentation - and waited till own hour for a publication. 

Previous  several  decades  of  intensive  investigations,  connected  with  development  of  basic ideas of the Wave 
Universe Concept, created the fundamental base for break in new, early unexperienced range of knowledge. Value 
of receiving results is extremely extensive. Majority from its still remain nonpublished. 

Suggesting continuations, consequances of WU Concept ideas, often, such natural and evident, that it may be 
waited  in  not  far  future  appearences  of  works  and  papers  of  another  advanced  researchers,  where  these  results 
will be rediscovered, developed in details. 

The  alternative  character  of  the  aproach  too  evident,  it  opens  unexpected  perspectives  and  those  possible 
circumstanies and new problems, which, frequently, arise with proposals and appearences of principally new ideas. 
Why,  as  Niels  Bohr  said,  -  "Problems  are  more  important,  then  decisions  -  solutions  can  be  obsolete,  but 

problems - never".

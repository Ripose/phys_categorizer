The  nonlinear  oscillator  model  is  useful  to  basically  understand  the  most  important  properties  of

nonlinear  optical  processes.  It  has  been  shown  to  give  the  correct  asymptotic  behaviour  and  to

provide the general features of harmonic generation to all orders, in particular dispersion relations

and sum rules.  We  investigate  the  properties  of  Pump  and  Probe  processes  using  this  model,  and

study those cases where general theorems based on the holomorphic character of the Kubo response

functions cannot be applied. We show that it is possible to derive new sum rules and new Kramers-

Krönig relations for the two lowest momenta of the real and of the imaginary part of the third order

susceptibility  and  that  new  specific  contributions  become  relevant  as  the  intensity  of  the  probe

increases.  Since  the  analitic  properties  of  the  susceptibility  functions  depend  only  upon  the  time

causality  of  the  system  we  are  confident  that  these  results  are  not  model  dependent  and  therefore

have  a  general  validity,  provided  one  substitutes  to  the  equilibrium  values  of  the  potential

derivatives the density matrix expectation values of the corresponding operators.

The  theoretical  and  experimental  investigation  of  systems  responding  to  Pump  and  Probe

optical  beams  is  an  important  branch  of  research  in  solid  state  physics  [1,2,3,4,5,6].  The  most

important nonlinear effect is the modification of the optical response near each resonance, which is

often called the dynamical Stark effect [7,8,9,10,11]. Other new effects are however present, such as

the two-photons absorption [12,13,14,15] and the stimulated Raman scattering [16,17,18,19,20]. To

completely interpret the above phenomena detailed calculations are necessary [21,22,23,24,25] but

in general they are very difficult to perform with the required accuracy for realistic systems. For this

reason general properties of the nonlinear response functions are very useful for the interpretation of

experimental  data  and  the  testing  of  appropriate  models  [26,27,28].  In  particular,  sum  rules  and

Kramers-Krönig (K.K.) relations are expected to be of great help also in nonlinear optics, because

they only depend on general properties, such as time causality, and must be verified by any physical

system.

Sum  rules  and  K.K.  relations  have  been  derived  for  those  specific  nonlinear  processes

represented by the susceptibility

th power of the intensity of the

pump beam. In fact it has the property of being holomorphic in the upper complex half plane of the

variable w

 thanks to Scandolo’s theorem [29].

When we consider nonlinear effects also due to the probe beam the previous treatment is not
valid anymore and new poles in the nth order susceptibility functions appear in the upper complex

plane.  Scandolo’s  theorem  in  this  case  is  not  verified  so  that  nothing  can  be  said  about  K.K.

relations  and  sum  rules  from  the  previous  analyses.  This  is  clearly  explained  in  the  book  by

Peiponen et al. [30]

The  main  purpose  of  the  present  work  is  to  study  in  detail  the  third  order  susceptibility

(
χ ω( )3

)
1   with  a  probe  beam  and  a  pump  beam,  and  to  derive  general  properties  such  as  K.K.

relations and sum rules. Since such general properties do not depend on the microscopic decription

of the nonlinear system, we adopt a simple anharmonic oscillator model along the line described by

Bloembergen [1] and Garrett [31,32] and previously adopted for the studty of harmonic generation

3

[33]  and  for  general  studies  of  sum  rules  in  special  cases  [34,35,36].  Such  a  model  allows  a

derivation  of  the  most  important  features,  considering  all  nonlinearities  and  including  also  the

nonlinear effects arising from the probe beam. We will show that new K.K. relations and modified

sum rules can be obtained, taking into account optical rectification and considering the poles in the

upper complex plane, which originate from the probe nonlinearities.

From  previous  experience  with  harmonic  generation  processes  [33]  we  feel  confident  that

the  results  here  obtained  can  be  extended  to  the  quantum  mechanical  analysis  by  substituting  the

expectation  values  of  the  potential  derivatives  to  their  values  at  equilibrium  used  in  the  classical

description.

In section II  we describe our model and give formulas for 

, while the higher orders

(
)3( ωχ
1

)

expressions are given in the Appendix. We analyze the structure of the third order susceptibility and

we  show  that  the  holomorphic  and  non  holomorphic  contributions  can  be  separated  and  their

respective properties can be considered. In section III. we derive our modified sum rules. In section

IV we derive the K.K. relations and discuss their connection with the sum rules. In section V  we

present our conclusions.

We observe that both holomorphic  contributions,  which  obey  Scandolo’s  theorem  [26,29],

and nonholomorphic contributions are present. Among the holomorphic contributions, the term (4b)

gives the usual correction to the linear resonance (dynamical Stark effect), the term (4c) originates

from optical rectification and is usually neglected, while the contributions (4d) and (4e) include the

two-photon absorption and the stimulated Raman scattering. We notice that the holomorphic terms

(4b) and (4c) together constitute the main contribution

in  the  literature  [2,30]  and  are  discussed  in  ref.  [30],  where  also  the  problems  due  to  the

meromorphic terms (4f), (4g) and (4h) are enphasized. We observe that the nonholomorphic terms

are due to the nonlinear effects of the only probe beam, (4f) corresponding to frequencies mixing,

(4g) to optical rectification and (4h) to the two-photon absorption of the probe beam.

combination  of  two.  These  are  the  only  way  possible  ways  to  obtain  a  third  order  susceptibility

(

. Obviously, if the system has particular symmetries, some terms can be equal to zero; for

instance in the case of inversion symmetry all the odd derivatives of the potential are zero so that

only terms (4b) and (4f) survive.

We  can  notice  that  the  only  poles  of  the  upper  complex  plane  appearing  in  the  last  three

terms (4f), (4g) and (4h) correspond to the solutions of

The  general  purpose  of  sum  rules  is  to  find  the  values  of  the  moments  of  the  real  and  of  the

imaginary part of the susceptibility. This is possible up to a given moment, above which the integral

diverges. Before deriving the sum rules by direct calculations we want to show how it is possible to

find linear relations between the four sum rules referred to the first two moments of the third order

susceptibility 

 just by considering the following fundamental property of all susceptibility

as a+ib and -a+ib , corresponding respectively to the poles at c+id and -c+id. We define S0 and S2

respectively the zeroth and the second moment of the real part, while S1 and S3 the first and the third

We  have  found  how  to  express  the  real  and  imaginary  part  of  the  values  of  the  residues  of  the

susceptibility  function  as  linear  combinations  of  S0  and  S1.  Since  S2  and  S3  are  functions  of  the

which depends only on the two lowest moments. The explicit calculation for S2  gives:

to compute the contributions of the holomorphic terms [26,27], obtaining immediately that all the

moments of the terms (4d) and (4e) are zero because of their fast asymptotic decrease (

We  underline  that  the  only  parts  proportional  to  the  intensity  of  the  pump  beam  are  the  first  two

terms  of  the  third  momentum  of  the  imaginary  part,  which  originate  from  the  holomorphic

contribution 

.  They  correspond  to  those  previously  derived  [27].  However  another  term,

(
)3( ωχ
1

)

proportional  to the probe intensity,  appears in this  moment.  This  third  term  is  S3  ,  while  we  can

identify (18) as S0 , (19) as S2 , (20) as S1. So all the Si with i =0,1,2,3 are proportional to the probe

intensity. We have also the confirmation that all these terms obey the linear relations (12) and (15),

as can easily be checked with algebraic calculations.

It  is  useful  to  verify  the  existence  of  specific  K.K.  relations  and  to  show  how  they  are

modified with respect to those already obtained for the holomorphic contribution 

)3( ωχ

)

 [26].

The method is to consider explicitely the poles in the upper complex plane and to perform

the  Cauchy  integrals  for  all  the  moments  which  are  allowed  by  the  asympotic  behaviour.  The

asymptotic behaviour of 

)3( ωχ

−∝ ω , so that the moments to be considered are

It  is  interesting  to  note  the  perfect  simmetry  between  the  two  K.K.  relations  (24)  and  (25)  with

respect  to  the  terms  originating  from  non-holomorphic  contributions:  it  can  be  observed  a  clear

correspondence  between  S0  and  S1  in  the  (24)  with  respectively  S2  and  S3  in  the  (25).  We  can

12

observe that all the terms originating from non-holomorphic contributions are linear with respect to

the Si with i=0,1,2,3.

The  nonlinear  K.K.  relations  we  have  here  obtained  are  more  general  than  the  ones  given

before, and in each of them we have also terms which are proportional to the intensity of the probe

beam  and  are  directly  related  to  the  two  lowest  moments  of  the  susceptibility  S0  and  S1.  Our

procedure is a direct one, and avoids the use of the maximum entropy hypothesis [37,38] adopted by

Peiponen [30,39,40,41].

Our  K.K.  analyses,  as  given  by  (24)  and  (25),  are  analytically  complete  and  overcome  the

difficulties explicitely shown in ref. [30] (see for instance fig. 3.6 at p.60 and fig. 5.5 at p. 92). In

comparison with the results of the maximum entropy method shown in fig. 5.5 at p. 92 in ref. [30],

our  results  reproduce  exactly  the  relations  between  the  real  and  the  imaginary  part  of  the

susceptibility, since no hypotheses or approximations have been made.

9(cid:17)(cid:3)&21&/86,216

We wish to summarize the main results obtained above as follows.

The  anharmonic  oscillator  model  has  been  used  to  derive  general  expressions  for  the  nonlinear

susceptibility  with  Pump  and  Probe  optical  beams.  The  lowest  order  susceptibility 

)3( ωχ
( 1

)

  is

shown  to  contain  terms  proportional  to  |E2|2  and  also  terms  proportional  to  |E1|2  .  The  former  are

holomorphic in the upper complex plane with respect to the variable w

 and consequently obey sum

1

rules and Kramers-Krönig relations of the type derived previously. The latter  contain  poles  in  the

upper complex w

 plane, and give contributions to the nonlinear sum rules and K.K. relations which

1

had been formerly neglected. These contributions are shown to depend on the zero and first moment

of the susceptibility only.

The above contributions to the sum rules have been shown to depend on the derivatives of

the potential at the equilibrium position, the third order susceptibility depending on the fourth order

derivative and on the square of the third order derivative.

The above results are expected to be of general significance, in spite of the simplicity of the

model adopted, because they are only determined by the analytic properties of  the response function

due to time causality.  It  can  be  shown  in  fact  that  the  leading  holomorphic  term  here  considered,

(

)3(

ωωωωχ
2
1

−

;

,

,

2

1

)

,  gives  the  same  result  in  the  most  general  physical  system,  treated  with  the

Kubo response function [42], provided one substitutes the expectation values of the derivatives for

13

the  values  at  the  equilibrium  position.,  and  one  considers  the  corresponding  tensor  which  obtains

from the spatial directions of the applied fields.

The  results  here  presented  can  be  of  interest  for  a  detailed  analysis  of  experimental  data

because they show explicitely the dependence on the intensity of the probe beam itself which must

appear in the third order  susceptibility 

. Experimentally it is also possible to separate the

(
)3( ωχ
1

)

contribution  proportional  to  the  pump  intensity  by  using  modulation  techniques  so  that  the

holomorphic  and  the  nonholomorphic  contributions  can  be  separately  measured.  We  suggest

experiments where both the probe frequency and the probe intensity can be varied, so as to verify

the appearence of the additional contributions in the sum rules and K.K. relations.

In order to consider Pump and Probe experiments we specialize the expression for the probe

frequency  imposing  r=1  and  s=0  in  expression  (4)  and  define  the  following  quantity,  which

immediately results to be limited to odd n :

The above expressions contain terms which are predominant for an intense pump beam and a

weak  probe,  and  are  holomorphic  in  the  upper  complex  w

  plane.  This  corresponds  to  the

contribution considered in the Kubo [42] expression and used in [26] to derive K.K. relations. Such

Abstract 

We  present  a  Photon-Assisted  Cascaded  Electron  Multipliers  (PACEM) 
which  has  a  potential  for  ion  back-flow  blocking  in  gaseous  radiation  detectors: 
the  avalanche  from  a  first  multiplication  stage  propagates  to  the  successive  one 
via its photons, which in turn induce photoelectron emission from a photocathode 
deposited  on  the  second  multiplier  stage;  the  multiplication  process  may  further 
continue  via  electron-avalanche  propagation.  The  photon-mediated  stage  allows, 
by a proper choice of geometry and fields, complete blocking of the ion back-flow 
into  the  first  element;  thus,  only  ions  from  the  latter  will  flow  back  to  the  drift 
region.  The  PACEM  concept  was  validated  in  a  double-MHSP  (Micro-Hole  & 
Strip  Plate)  cascaded  multiplier  operated  in  xenon,  where  the  intermediate 
scintillation stage provided optical gain of ~60. The double-MHSP detector had a 
total gain above 104 and energy resolution of 18% FWHM for 5.9 keV x-rays.

1. Introduction 
In  this  work,  we  present  the  concept  Photon-Assisted  Cascaded  Electron 
Multipliers (PACEM) that has a potential for blocking avalanche-induced ions in 
cascaded gaseous electron multipliers: the avalanche originating in a first element 
propagates  to  the  following  ones  solely  via  its  photons,  which  in  turn  induce 
photoelectrons  in  the  next  multiplication  stage.  By  a  proper  choice  of  the  gas, 
geometry  and  electric  fields  the  photon-assisted  propagation  can  be  made  very 
efficient,  while  the  charge  transport  between  the  stages  is  completely  blocked. 
Consequently  only  ions  from  the  first  multiplication  stage  will  flow  back  to  the 
drift volume (or to the photocathode, in case of a gaseous photomultiplier). 

Light emitted from excited gas molecules, and in electron avalanches, has 
been  used  for  more  than  two  decades  for  signal  amplification  and/or  readout  in 
radiation  detectors  [1-7].  The  optical  recording  of  avalanche  signals  has  the 
advantage of being mechanically and electrically decoupled from the detector and 
thus  immune  to  high-voltage  problems  and  insensitive  to  electronic  noise.  The 
pursue of suitable gas mixtures to be used with adequate photon readout systems, 
in  various  applications  including  gaseous  photon  detectors,  has  been  for  many 
years a major subject of research; the goal has been high light yield in the near-
UV and visible ranges, compatible with the practical range of optical components 
and photon detectors [2-7]. Already in the late seventies several authors discussed 
the  idea,  reviewed  in  [2],  of  recording  gas-scintillation  photons  (mainly  from 
xenon) with another gaseous wire chamber filled with photosensitive vapours; the 
idea was to replace standard photomultipliers by large-area economic devices. In a 
recent work, the authors suggested a "hybrid photo-detector" for the visible light: 
gas  scintillation  in  xenon,  induced  by  photoelectrons  emitted  from  a  bialkali 
photocathode, was detected in a wire-chamber  incorporating  a  CsI  photocathode 
[8]. The idea was to prolong the bialkali photocathode life-time by its decoupling 
from  the  electron  avalanche.  In  addition  to  their  beneficial  role  in  optically-
recorded  detectors,  photon-mediated  gas-avalanche  build-up  is  one  of  the  basic 
mechanisms in detectors operating in Geiger- and Geiger-like modes [9].  

On the other hand, photon emission, particularly in the UV spectral range, 
is  rather  disturbing  in  most  gaseous  detectors;  their  interaction  with  the  gas  and 
with  detector  elements  causes  secondary,  photon-feedback  effects,  usually 
limiting the detector's gain and performance. This drawback was overcome with 
the  introduction  of  the  Gas  Electron  Multiplier  (GEM)  [10];  the  avalanche 
the  GEM  holes  effectively  hinders  photon-mediated 
confinement  within 
secondary processes, particularly in cascaded configurations [11,12], allowing for 
high gains; these were reached in cascaded GEM and  Micro Hole & Strip plate 
(MHSP) [13] also in highly UV-scintillating gases, such as noble-gases [14] and 
CF4 [15]. Intensive investigations of such multipliers, in these gases and often in 
combination  with  CsI  photocathodes,  have  been  carried  out  in  the  fields  of 
gaseous photomultipliers  [16,  17], neutron  detectors [18], x-ray imaging devices 
[14, 19] and in dual-phase noble-liquid detectors [20]. 

The  performances  of  gaseous  detectors  are  also  severely  limited  by 
avalanche-induced  ions.  There  have  been  intensive  efforts  in  recent  years 
attempting to reduce to minimum the ion-backflow; numerous ideas and methods 
were  investigated  for  blocking  the  ions  during  their  drift  process,  by  deviating 
them electrostatically from their original trajectory [21]; the ion-backflow fraction 
(IBF, the fraction of final-avalanche ions that flow back to the drift volume) could 

be reduced at best to 10-3 and 10-4, in DC and in pulse-gate modes, respectively. 
The best ion-blocking performances so far were reached in cascaded GEMs and 
MHSPs [21] and in Micromegas multipliers [22]. However, these IBF values are 
still too high for some applications, e.g. in Time Projection Chambers (TPC) and 
in  gaseous  photomultipliers,  particularly  for  the  visible-spectral  range,  as 
discussed in [21]. 

In this work we present an approach that totally blocks the ion back-flow 
to the first multiplying element, with only the ions from this stage flowing back to 
the  drift  field.  We  describe  the  method,  provide  the  results  of  our  preliminary 
studies  and  discuss  the  method's  limitations,  applicability  and  future  research 
plans. 

 

2. The Photon-Assisted Cascaded Electron Multiplier  

The  Photon-Assisted  Cascaded  Electron  Multiplier  (PACEM)  concept  is 
shown  in  Fig.  1,  e.g.  for  a  double-element  MHSP  multiplier  investigated  within 
this work. In this scheme, the two elements are optically coupled, within the same 
gas  volume,  through  a  charge-blocking  mesh-electrode  G1.  Radiation-induced 
ionization electrons, deposited in the drift volume, are focussed into the holes of 
MHSP1  and  create  an  avalanche  within  the  holes;  a  second  avalanche  occurs  at 
the  anode  strips,  where  all  electrons  are  collected  [13].  Avalanche-generated 
photons  induce  photoelectrons  from  the  CsI  photocathode  deposited  on  the  top 
face of MHSP2; these create the final avalanche within the MHSP2 holes and at 
its  anode  strips.  As  discussed  in  [23],  depending  on  the  induction  field  below 
MHSP2, 20-40% of the final-avalanche ions drift back through the MHSP2 holes; 
these should be blocked by the G1 mesh, which is polarized (here grounded) such 
that the fields on its both sides are reversed. Under these conditions, regardless of 
the total gain of the cascaded detector, only ions originating from the first element 
will flow back to the initial drift region, or to the top face of the first multiplier 
(e.g. a reflective photocathode in a gaseous photomultiplier). This opto-coupling 
technique  may  be  therefore  applied  between  the  first  two  stages  of  GPMs  and 
TPC  readout  elements  as  a  mean  for  reducing  the  ion  backflow,  provided  ways 
and  conditions  are  found  to  reduce  the  first's  stage  IBF  to  a  minimal  acceptable 
value. 

Moreover, with a proper design of the photon-mediated stage, the number 
of photoelectrons induced on the photocathode at the second stage may exceed the 
number  of  primary  electrons  in  the  drift  region,  resulting  in  what  we  define  as 
optical gain. It should be noted that the photon-mediated multiplication concept, 
shown  in  Fig.1,  can  naturally  be  applied  in  many  different  cascaded-multiplier 
configurations. The first element can be a wire chamber, a parallel-grid multiplier, 
a GEM etc.; it  should be preferably one which provides the  maximal  light  yield 
for  a  given  gas  gain  as  to  generate  the  minimal  number  of  ions  per  event.  The 
cascade  may  comprise  elements  of  different  types,  of  which  the  number  will  be 
chosen  according  to  the  desirable  total  gain.  Some  advanced  patterned  ion-
deviating elements are discussed elsewhere [21, 24, 25].   

 
3. Results and discussion 
The study was carried out with the setup of  Fig.1, using  55Fe 5.9 keV x-
rays. The wire mesh (80 µm diameter stainless steel wires with 900 µm spacing) 
was  placed  at  a  distance  of  2  mm  from  each  multiplier's  face;  the  respective 
lengths of the drift and the induction regions are 17 mm and 2 mm. The detector 

was placed in a stainless steel vessel, evacuated to a vacuum of 10-6 mbar and then 
filled  with  xenon  at  1  bar,  continuously  purified  by  convection  with  non-
evaporable  getters  (SAES  St707);  the  latter  were  placed  in  a  small  volume 
connected to the detector's vessel and operated at temperatures ~150ºC. The mesh, 
the  detector  window  and  the  induction  plane  were  grounded;  the  drift  field  was 
kept  at  ED=120  V/cm;  the  transfer  fields  (ET1  and  ET2),  on  both  sides  of  the  G1 
mesh, were kept reversed to each other, as shown in Fig.1, ET2 being set close to 
zero to ensure good efficiency in the focussing of the photoelectrons into the holes 
[16]  and  ET1  about  -3kV/cm.  The  voltage  difference  between  the  anode  and 
cathode  strips  (∆Vaci)  of  both  MHSPs  as  well  as  the  voltages  across  the  holes 
(Vholei) were varied in order to set the multiplier's gain. 

The  charge  produced  on  the  anode  strips  of  MHSP1  and  the  avalanche-
induced  scintillation-photon  yield,  both  dictated  by  Vhole1  and  ∆Vac1,  are 
proportional to the number of primary electrons deposited in the gas (drift region) 
by  the  5.9  keV  x-rays.  The  VUV  scintillation  photons  (λ~172 nm  in  Xe) 
impinging  on  the  CsI-photocathode  deposited  on  the  top  surface  of  MHSP2, 
induce  the  emission  of  photoelectrons  (QE~30%  at  170 nm  [26]).  The  charge 
multiplication in MHSP2 is dictated by Vhole2 and ∆Vac2, yields a final charge at 
the  anode  strips  -  proportional  to  the  charge  and  light  produced  at  MHSP1.  
Typical pulse-height distributions of signals collected on the anode strips of both 
MHSPs are depicted in Fig.2; the one of MHSP2 is a result of the photon-assisted 
cascaded  multiplication.  Good  signal-to-noise  and  peak-to  valley  levels  were 
obtained; energy resolutions of ~18% FWHM were recorded on both electrodes, 
indicating that the optical coupling does not deteriorate the charge multiplication 
properties.  

The optical coupling was investigated by varying the scintillation yield of 
MHSP1  (varying  ∆Vac1  and  Vhole1)  and  keeping  MHSP2  potentials  and  gain 
constant  (Vhole2  =  370V  and  ∆Vac2 = 200V).  The  charge  gain  of  MHSP2  was 
determined by grounding the mesh G1 and all MHSP1 electrodes, and biasing the 
MHSP2 top electrode to get ET2=100 V/cm (see direction in Fig.1); this permitted 
collecting the charge pulses induced only by x-ray interactions in the gap between 
G1 and MHSP2 top electrode. For the above biasing voltages, a gain of G2 = 350 
was  obtained.  The  same  charge  amplification  chain  was  used  for  recording  all 
signals.  

Fig.3 presents the charge gain G1 obtained at MHSP1 anode strips and the 
total  gain  Gtotal  of  the  full,  photon-assisted,  cascaded  multiplier,  recorded  at 
MHSP2 anode strips, as a function of Vhole1, (Fig.3a) and of ∆Vac1 (Fig.3b). Vhole1 
and  ∆Vac1  were  kept  in  the  safe,  discharge-free  range.  Absolute  gains  above  103 
and 104 were reached in MHSP1 and in the entire cascade, respectively.  

The  total  number  of  electrons  collected  on  the  anode  strips  of  MHSP2, 
Ntotal,  can  be  written  in  terms  of  Gtotal  and  the  number  of  primary  electrons  N0 
produced  in  the  5.9  keV  x-ray  interaction,  or  in  terms  of  the  charge  gain  of 
MHSP2,  G2  (G2  =  350  for  the  present  conditions),  and  the  number  of 
photoelectrons Npe transferred through the holes:

The optical gain, Gopt, of the optical-coupling stage is defined as the ratio Npe/N0 
and is given by Gtotal/G2; it is depicted in both Figs.3a and 3b. Optical-gain values 
~60  were  recorded,  demonstrating  the  feasibility  and  efficiency  of  the  proposed 
light-assisted multiplier cascade method in xenon. 

In  Fig.3a  the  curves  for  Gtotal  and  G1  are  parallel,  indicating  that  the 
number  of  photons  produced  in  the  avalanche  increases  proportionally  to  the 
number  of  avalanche  electrons  collected  on  MHSP1  anode  strips,  within  the 
investigated  Vhole1  range.  On  the  other  hand,  in  Fig.3b  the  optical  gain  increase 
with   ∆Vac1  is  not  proportional  to  that  of  G1,  namely  the  light  production  is  not 
proportional to the charge multiplication at the strips. This can be explained by the 
increase of the reduced electric field (E/p) around the anode strips, which results 
in an increase of the Townsend coefficient, favouring electron-impact ionizations 
on photon-generating excitations of the gas molecules.  

It should be noted that we used a MHSP as the first multiplier element, in 
the scheme shown in Fig.1, in order to induce scintillation at the anode strips. For 
comparison,  we  operated  this  first  element  also  in  a  GEM-mode,  namely  with 
hole-multiplication only, keeping ∆Vac1=0. Fig.4 compares Gtotal as a function of 
Vhole1, for ∆Vac1= 0 and 220V. For equal Vhole1 values the GEM-mode yielded a 
five-fold lower total gain compared to the MHSP-mode.  

 
4. Conclusions 
We demonstrated the operation principle of the Photon-Assisted Cascaded 
Electron  Multiplier  in  Xe.  Avalanche-induced  photons  from  a  first  MHSP, 
impinging on a second, CsI-coated MHSP, yielded an optical gain of ~60 with a 
total double-stage gain of 104. In this scheme, a properly biased intermediate grid 
blocked  the  transport  of  both  electrons  and  back-drifting  ions  between  the  two 
multipliers.  

This optical-gate concept could be used for reducing the ion backflow in 
cascaded  electron  multipliers.  In such a scheme, only ions produced in the first 
multiplier will contribute to the ion backflow to the drift volume, or towards the 
photocathode  in  a  gaseous  photomultiplier.  Methods  are  being  investigated  for 
reducing this residual IBF.  

With  the  present  configuration  of  double-MHSP  in  xenon  we  can  easily 
estimate  the  residual  IBF,  following  the  experience  gained  with  ion  backflow 
measurements in multi-GEM and GEM/MHSP multipliers.  From [23] we know 
that  the  ions  produced  in  the  anode-strip  avalanche  are  partly  collected  on  the 
neighbouring  cathode  strips  and  partly  on  the  cathode  mesh  below  the  MHSP. 
Thus, for an induction field of -5kV/cm, a residual 20% fraction of ions (and up to 
40%  at  -1kV/cm)  will  go  back  into  the  MHSP  holes  (see  figure  6  in  [23]).  The 
fraction of ions escaping from the first-element holes depends on the hole voltage 
and  on  the  drift  field  [27,28];  it  was  measured  by  us  (Fig.5)  for  a  single  MHSP 
operated in GEM mode at 1atm. Ar/CH4(5%). At Vhole=400V the IBF is 17% with 
Edrfit=0.3kV/cm  and  it  varies  almost  linearly  with  Edrift.  Thus  for  Edrift=1  or  0.1 
kV/cm we should expect IBF~50% or ~5%, respectively.  

At  the  highest  operation  gains  in  the  present  work,  the  first  MHSP 
operates at a total gain of 3*103, of which the multiplication in the holes and at the 
strips  is  about  equal.  This  implies  that  the  dominant  contribution  to  the  IBF  is 
from the final avalanche at the strips, and we should expect ~400 or ~40 ions per 
event on the average, for Edrfit=1 or 0.1kV/cm, respectively. With a total detector 
gain  of  2*104  this  result  is  equivalent  to  IBF=2*10-2  or  2*10-3  at  the 
corresponding  drift  fields.  This  result  is,  in  fact,  inferior  to  the  best  IBF  values 
obtained so far by electrostatic DC means [25]. 

To further improve the IBF, ways for reducing the charge gain in the first 
multiplier  should  be  found,  but  without  loosing  the  primary-electron  detection 

efficiency. Possible approaches should be modification of the present scheme by 
optimizing  the  geometry  of  the  first  MHSP,  e.g.  by  enlarging/reducing  the  hole 
diameter. Another possibility is to reduce the gain on the strips, compromising the 
optical gain, but significantly reducing the number of ions back-flowing through 
the  holes.  In  the  present  work  for  example,  by  reducing  the  multiplication  on 
MHSP1  strips,  its  charge  gain  could  be  reduced  (e.g.  a  factor  10)  but  with  a 
smaller reduction in optical gain (e.g. only a factor 3) (see Fig 3b), thus improving 
the IBF by factor 10 without a significant effect on the energy resolution and other 
detector performances. In our most recent (yet unpublished) work, the fraction of 
ions  escaping  the  hole  could  be  further  reduced  by  flipping  the  MHSP’s  strips 
towards the drift volume, which could be implemented in this PACEM concept. 
Other  then  hole-multipliers,  different  multiplier  configurations  could  be  studied 
for  this  purpose,  as  mentioned  before,  such  as  wire-chambers,  parallel  gaps, 
Micromegas,  etc.;  Micromegas  thin-gap  multipliers  would  have  an  advantage  of 
electro-statically blocking the ions simply due to the favourable field ratio to the 
drift  field  [22].  However,  such  "open-geometry"  multipliers  may  suffer  photon-
feedback  effects.  A  wide  parallel-gap  multiplier  operating  as  a  scintillation  gap 
may  produce  a  favourable  photon-to-ion  yield;  however,  such  an  arrangement 
could spoil the localization resolution of the detector.   

Most  important  for  the  successful  operation  of  the  Photon-Assisted 
Cascaded  Electron  Multiplier  is  to  find  adequate  gas  mixtures,  having  high 
scintillation yields – matching the spectral sensitivity of the photocathode. From 
our  experience,  CsI  has  the  highest  stability  and  largest  quantum  yield  among 
practical  photocathode  candidates  [26].  Xe,  Kr  and  Ar  and  their  mixtures  have 
emission  spectra  matching  the  CsI  response.  CF4,  which  is  a  good  counting  gas 
for  hole-multipliers  [15]  emits  only  a  fraction  of  its  light  in  the  CsI  sensitivity 
range  [29]  and  may  therefore  require  detector’s  first-stage  operation  at  higher 
gains.  

Further  investigations  of  this  optical  ion-blocking  concept  are  in  course; 
they  mostly  concentrate  on  the  optimization  of  the  gas  mixtures  and  on  ion 
blocking at the first multiplication stage.

Fig.1  –  Schematic  layout  of  a  double-MHSP  detector  operated  in  the  photon-
assisted  cascaded  electron-multiplier  mode.  The  electron  avalanche  initiated  in 
MHSP1 emits photons that induce photoelectrons from a photocathode (e.g. CsI) 
deposited on MHSP2; they are multiplied in the latter creating the final avalanche 
on its anode. Back-drifting ions are all collected at the grounded mesh, G1.

Fig.5 - Ion Back-flow Fraction (IBF) in a single MHSP element operated in GEM 
mode (no potential difference on the strips), in 1atm. Ar/CH4(5%), as function of: 
a)  the  drift  field;  b)  the  hole  gain  (voltage).  The  IBF  decreases  almost  linearly 
with Vhole (increasing the dipole field) while the absolute number of ions increases 
exponentially (typical avalanche growth).

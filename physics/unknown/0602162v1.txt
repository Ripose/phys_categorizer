ANALYSIS OF THE CARDIAC MUSCLE DEPOLARISATION 

Jerzy Stanisław Janicki 

Medical Physics Research Institute in Poznan, Poland 

On the basis of the model of the current flow through a single fibre, 
changes in the electric charge density over the myocardium are described. 
With  the  use  of  relevant  analytic  formulae,  supported  with  numerical 
calculations,  the  distribution  and  time  dependencies  of  electric  potentials 
on the surface of the thorax have been determined. The results obtained are 
compared with empirical data. A strong correlation between the theoretical 
predictions  and  the  experimental  data  has  been  obtained.  The  model  in 
question  permits  examination  of  instantaneous  potentials  resulting  from 
electrical activation of particular segments of the cardiac muscle.

Introduction 

 

The  paper  reports  results  of  a  fragment  of  study  realised  at  the 
Medical  Physics  Research  Institute  within 
the  project  on  physical 
phenomena related to the cardiac muscle activity and numerical analysis 
of electric pulses generated by this activity.  

Interpretation  of  the  standard  electrocardiography  signals  is 
usually  based  on  the  model  introduced  by  Einthoven  describing  the 
electric field generated by the cardiac muscle in terms of a distribution of 
charges forming an electric dipole. A more complex structure of charges 
distributed  in  the  cardiac  muscle  volume  is  proposed  by  the  theory  of 
multipoles [1] permitting analysis of the spatial distribution of potentials 
appearing  around  the  cardiac  muscle  [2,3].  Another  approach  to  the 
electric signals produced by the cardiac muscle is presented in a classical 
work of Noble [4] based on the Hodgkins-Huxley equations and analysis 
of  potentials  in  the  Purkinje  fibre.  The  properties  of  the  cells  are 
described by a function of 23 variables describing 12 types of ionic flows 
in  the  cardiac  muscle  cells  [5].  The  flows  related  to  the  ion 
transportations  (positive  e.g.  Na+,  K+,  Ca++  or  negative  like  Cl−)  are 
nonlinear in character [6-8] and the equations describing their dynamics 
can  be  solved  only  by  complex  numerical  techniques  [9].  Analysis  of 
ECG  signals  is  also  often  performed  with  the  use  of  advanced 
mathematical methods [10-15].  

Despite  the  common  access  to  numerical  methods  it  often 
happens that changes in the electric potential cannot be explained on the 
basis of the hitherto assumed theories. Still, often surprising observations 
are  significant  changes  in  the  ECG  picture  of  healthy  patients  and  no 
changes in patients diagnosed with serious cardiological conditions.   

The  aim  of  the  paper  is  to  present  a  new  model  describing  the 
appearance of transient potentials on depolarisation of the cardiac muscle 
chamber,  taking  into  account  the  space-time  relations  and  physiological 
and  pathological  factors,  and  indicate  its  advantages  for  evaluation  of 
individual activations.

factors.  The 

The  method  of  analysis  of  the  electrocardiographic  signals 
presented in this paper is based on a physical model of the appearance 
and  propagation  of  an  electric  charge  wave  on  depolarization  of 
different  segments  of  the  ventricles.  Each  of  the  segments  corresponds 
to a bundle of working conducting fibres along which a variable in time 
distribution  of  a  resultant  charge  density appears. It is accompanied by 
the  emergence  of  the  instantaneous  electric  potential,  whose  value 
fibres 
depends  on  physiological  and  pathological 
investigated  are  built  of  cylindrical-shaped  cells  of  about  15  µm  in 
thickness  and  100  µm  in  length,  usually  arranged  parallel  to  each  other 
with  a  definite  number  of  branches  and  interconnections.  Between  the 
cells  there  is  a  direct  contact  through  specific  links  of  low  resistance 
called gap junctions [18]. Propagation velocity of the charge wave along 
the  fibres  depends  on  the  efficiency  and  the  number  of  the  junctions, 
which  are  considerably  more  numerous  at  the  ends  than  on  the  lateral 
fibre edges [19]. Additionally, common membrane parts of adjacent cells 
ensure  a  free  flow  of  ions  and  small  hydrophilic  molecules  between 
subsequent cells, which prompts fast transfer of the activation along the 
fibre. The main role in this process is played by the ion channels in extra- 
and 
intracellular 
membranes  make  90%  of  the  cell  membranes,  and  mitochondric  ion 
channels  have  an  important  function  in  the  cell  ionic  homeostasis        
[21,  22].  As  a  result  of  the  subsequent  activation  and  deactivation 
processes of the channels, there is a local increase in the density of ions 
taking part in the transport of the electric charge. Thus, the areas with the 
charges  are  not  static,  and  the  dynamics  of  their  distribution  resembles 
the propagation of a charge wave along a given fibre of the myocardium. 
[23].  A  group  of  such  fibres  activated  simultaneously  in  one  of  CM 
segments  forms  a  bundle  along  which  a  wave  of  a  resultant  charge 
moves.  The  electric  charges  in  individual  bundles  are  activated  at 
different moments in time, contributing independently to the total electric 
potential.  In  effect  we  can  observe  the  appearance  of  potentials 
undergoing  significant  changes  in  position  and  time.  Consequently,  the 
multi-centred  process  of  instantaneous  excitations  [16]  reflects  the 
depolarisation of particular CM regions, giving rise to the appearance of 
anisotropic  potential  distributions  around  the  myocardium.  The  charge 

intracellular  biological  membranes 

[20].  The 

3 

 

changing  on CM depolarization  triggers  a flow of current [17], which is 
also  a  source  of  anisotropic  magnetic  field  distribution.  Time 
dependencies  and  distributions  of  magnetic  fields  for  each  of  the 
instantaneous excitations will be described in detail in a separate paper.  
Actually,  the  cardiac  muscle  is  built  of  the  three  characteristic  layers 
composed  of  the subendocardial  (W), M  type  (M)  and  subepicardial (N) 
cells  [24,25].  The  model  proposed  describes 
the  formation  and 
movement of a resultant charge wave along the CM fibre in the extra- (I) 
and  intracellular  (II)  regions.  The  waves  of  electric  charge  density  are 
generated  by  the  flow  of sodium (Na+),  potassium (K+)  and  chloride    
(Cl−) ions into the cells of the bundle.  
The rest state of the cells is a result of both active transport of ions Na+ 
and  K+  and  diffusive  and  electric  transport  of  ions  Na+,  K+  and  Cl−.  It 
should be remembered that also other ions, like calcium ion Ca2+ , take 
part  in  the  process.  However,  to  preserve  clarity  of  the  model,  which 
describes  changes  in  distribution  of  the  electric  charge  density  on 
depolarization, these ions are not shown.  
Actually, each of the areas (I and II) in its volume is electrically neutral, 
however,  in  the  area  of  a  thickness  of  about  1µm  around  the  cellular 
membrane there is a distinct layer of negative charges inside the cell and 
a  layer  of  positive  charges  outside  it.  This  insignificant  surplus  of 
heteropolar charges makes a difference in potentials of a value of about -
90x10−3V  between  the  areas  (I  and  II)  in  which  there  is  different 
concentration of ions of the same kind. The density of Na+ and Cl− ions 
is much higher in the extracellular area, whereas that of potassium ions 
K+  and  organic  anions  A−  is  much  higher  inside  the  cells.  The  organic 
anions  are  the  negatively  charged  amino  acids  and  proteins  remaining 
practically continuously outside the cells. The above analysis of the ion 
distribution  in  the  extra  and  intracellular  areas  concerns  the  cells  in  the 
rest  state.  This  state  changes  when  an  electric  pulse  from  the  stimuli 
conducting system reaches Purikinje's junctions placed on the side of the 
endocardium.    Then  the  potential  between  the  areas  increases,  forcing      
ions  (Na+) 
a  growing  flow  of  sodium 
the  cells.  Almost 
simultaneously  the  cells  in  deeper  layers  of  the  ventricle  walls  are 
activated  triggering  a  similar  effect  in  the  second  (M)  and  the  third  (N) 
part  of  the  fibre.  In  each  of  these  parts,  independent  changes  in                
a  resultant  electric  charge  density  take  place,  which  substantially 

into 

4 

 

influence the total charge produced by the whole fibre. As a result of the 
process we observe the emergence of regions of a greater concentration 
of  negative  charge  in  area  I  and  those  of  a  greater  concentration  of 
positive  charge  in  area  II.    The  charge  moves  along  the  fibre  in  the 
direction of propagation of the activation. After the passage of the wave 
front,  selective  extra-  and  intracellular  ion  channels  are  activated, 
enabling  the  flow  of  ions  both  between  areas  I  and  II  as  well  as  inside 
the activated fibre cells. Because of substantially higher conductivity of 
area  II,  the  propagation  of  electric  charge  takes  place  mainly  inside  the 
excited  fibre  in  the  direction  opposite  to  that  of  depolarization. 
Consequently,  each  CM  working  fibre  can  be  treated  as  a  sort  of  linear 
conducting  system,  stretched  between the endocardium and epicardium, 
through which the current related to ion transport flows.

At  the  beginning  we  consider  changes  in  the  electric  charge 
density  triggered  by  the  ion  transport  on  the  propagation  of  the 
depolarisation wave along one part of the fibre. In the model proposed, an 
increase  in  the  flow  of    Na+  ions  into  the  cells  causes  a  change  in  the 
−ρ  electric charge density in the intra- (II) and 
positive 
extracellular (I) areas, respectively. Each of these electric charge density 
values is determined by the charge appearing in the volume element

As  the  areas  I  and  II  are  characterised  by  quite  different  conducting 
properties,  we  can  consider  a  resultant  charge  density  obtained  taking 
into  regard  both  positive  and  negative  charges.  So,  we  introduce  the 
resultant charge density  ρ∆  defined with the formula:

One  should  note  that  the  density 

−ρ   is  connected  with  the 
negative  charge,  thus  in  specific  calculations  we  take  the  values  of  the 
appropriate parameters with a minus sign. 
Propagation  of  the  charge  waves  can  be  described  by  means  of

The  parameter

observed in the area of a geometric centre of a given fibre part (W,M,N),

3. Electric charge and dipole moment 

 

In  the  model  discussed  the  change  in  the  characteristic  quantities 
describing  a  given  charge  density  wave,  induces  changes  in  the  electric 
parameters of the myocardium area of interest. The total charge in a given 
area  as  well  as  moments  of  different  orders,  including  the  electric  dipole 
moment, can change. 

The spatial distribution and time changes in the total electric charge on 
+ρ  and 

depolarization of a given fibre are related to a distribution of positive 
negative  −ρ  charge density in the following way: 

 

)'t(q

=

(

+

)'t,'r(

ρ
−

't,'r(

'rd))

 

∫

F

(9)  

                             
where the integration is carried out over the area of the whole fibre  F, and 
the vector 
'r  describes the fibre position in a given coordinate system. One 
should remember that in the model proposed the charge densities are linear 
(they give charge per length unit). The waves of the negative and positive 
charges moving in the same direction have a similar character; however, the 
key  issue  is  their  interrelations.  According  to  the  above  analysis,  such 
parameters  as  the  amplitudes  of  these  waves,  their  mutual  positions  and 
the velocity of propagation of the disturbance in each of the fibre studied 
are  of  great  significance.  Depending  on  the  myocardium  condition  the 
values of the above parameters can change.    
In a specific case, the resultant charge density from a given bundle can be 
zero.  Then  the  amplitudes  of  both  waves  are  the  same,  and  so  are  the 
velocities of the ions distribution. However, the cardiac muscle activation is 
always  accompanied  with  a  time-dependent  electric  charge.  Moreover,  the 
final effect can also depend on a dipole moment occurring in the myocardium 
fibres, whose vector  pr  [26] is presented in the form:

F

(10) 

 
The  influence  of  higher  order  moments  on  the  value  of  the  potential 
measured is insignificant, therefore, their participation was omitted in further 
analysis. Due to the complex character of functions describing the charge 

9 

 

density  changes,  analytical  calculation  of  the  total  charge  or  dipole 
moments  is  practically  impossible.  Nonetheless,  regarding  the  geometry 
of  a  single  fibre  it  can  be  assumed  that  we  have  to  do  with  a  one-
dimensional charge distribution and in effect the fibre studied can be treated 
'r   in  equations  (9  and  10)  is 
as  a  one-dimensional  structure.  Then  vector 
replaced  by  the  coordinate  x’,  which  largely  simplifies  calculations,  and 
the  time  changes  in  the  electric  charge  and  the  dipole  moment  are 
described by the equations:

Although  only  one  fibre  part  and  a  partial change in the charge density 
have been taken into account in the above analysis, the formulae obtained 
are  still  extremely  complicated.  Thus,  because  of  the  difficulties  in 
finding  a  full  analytical  expression,  this  question  has  been  solved  by 
means  of  numerical 
the 
calculations  for  three  bundles  of  a  different  number  of  conducting 
fibres,  assuming  subsequently  in  the  formula  (9)  the  amplitude  values

4. Electric potential 

 

The  dynamics  of  charge  density  distribution  presented  here  is 
reflected in the potential, measured on the body surface, whose value at a 
given  measuring  site  depends,  among  other  things,  on  the  value  of  the 
resultant  electric  charge  at  a  given  moment.    The  contribution  to  the 
electric potential coming from a single charge is of isotropic character. On 
the  other  hand,  the  potential  measured  is  anisotropic.  One  should  note 
however,  that  in  separate  heart  regions,  the  processes  discussed  start  at 
different  moments  in  time.  Moreover,  each  fibre  bundle  has  a  different 
orientation  in  space,  which  leads  to  an  even  more  complicated  potential 
distribution.  

In general, the electric potential appearing around a single fibre is 

defined by a simple relation: 

 

ϕ

=

rρ∆

(14) 

 
where ρ∆   is  the  resultant  charge  density  in  the  infinitesimal  volume 

element dv’.  The position of this element is determined by the vector 'r , 
shown in (Fig. 5). Its length is a distance of the element volume dv’ from 
the fibre centre, which is the origin of the coordinate system. Besides, the 
vector  r describes  a  position  of  the  measuring  point  in  this  system. 
According  to  the  model  discussed,  each  fibre  studied  is  built  of  three 
parts (W,M,N) and each of them is a source of independent potential.  

11 

Considering  interrelations  between  them,  the  total  potential  value  can 
be  calculated  at  any  point  P  at  any  time 
of  the  depolarization  process  of  the 
whole fibre.

Therefore, the potential at any point Pi (i = 1,…,n) can be calculated by 
summation  of  all  contributions 
the  resultant  charge  density 
distribution  coming  from  each  element  of  the  fibre  at  the  time  t.             
A  separate  issue  is  to  calculate  the  potential  coming  from  the  whole 
bundle,  which  is  a  sum  of  potentials  produced  at  each  of  the  excited 
fibres in it. Now, we have to take into account the position of each fibre 
in relation to the geometrical centre of the bundle, which is the origin of 
the coordinate system. Mathematical details of this operation will be left 
out,  and  in  general,  the  potential  appearing  at  point  P  on  the  bundle 
depolarization can be presented as: 
 

ϕ

(15)

where summation runs over all fibres of a given bundle. Moreover, at a 
given moment of time the activated CM bundles are at different stages of 
depolarization  and  bring  their  own  independent  contributions  to  the 
potential  measured  at  a  given  point.  Hence,  the  value  measured  on  the 
body surface at P is a sum of all potentials existing at a given time. Then 
the resultant potential  Wϕ  can be expressed through the relation: 
∑=

)t,P(

where  the  summation  runs  over  all  bundles  taking  part  in  the  CM 
depolarization process (j = 1,…,10) taking into account to their position 
and  orientation  in  a  given  coordinate  system.  The  time  t  is  measured 
during  the  whole  depolarization  process.  The  potential  defined  with  the 
formula  (16)  comes  from  the  charges  from  a  limited  region,  assuming 
such  a  potential  scaling  in  which  they  would  disappear  in  an  infinite 
distance.  In  practice  on  the  body  surface  we  measure  the  potential 
difference  between  that  of  a  given  electrode  and  the  reference 
refϕ ,  determined  by  measurement  at  the  remaining  electrodes. 
potential
In  the  model  presented  we  also  take  into  regard  the  reference  potential 
calculated from Einthoven's triangle according to analogous rules of the 
standard  ECG  examination.  This  potential  is  a  sum  of  potentials 
calculated  at  the  points  of  the  limb  electrodes  in  the  standard  ECG 
examination.  The  value  of  the  reference  potential  also  depends  on  the 
moment  of  time  of  the  bundle  depolarization  process.    Then  the  total 
potential Cϕ ,  which  is  in  fact  a  difference  in  the  above-mentioned 
potentials 

 is described by the following relation:

Thus,  the  potential  value

point  P  (x,y,z)  and  on  time  in  which  the  depolarization  process  is 
considered.  Numerically  calculated  potential  distributions 
Cϕ  for a given 
CM bundle depending on the physiological and pathological factors will be 
discussed in detail further in this paper.

5. Material and methods 
 

To  verify  the  fundamental  assumptions  of  the  model  proposed,      

a test study was performed on three groups of patients (A,B,C). Groups A 
and  B  consisted  of  healthy  people,  whereas  in  the  group  C  there  were 
patients suspected of cardiac muscle ischemia. The patients from group C 
were  also  subjected  to  the  perfusion  scintigraphy  examination  SPECT 
and  stress  ECG.  The  program  of  study  was  carried  out  according  to 
methodology  developed  by  Prof.  Dr.  hab  of  Medical  Sciences  Andrzej 
Dąbrowski  after  receiving  a  written  approval  of  patients  and  an 
agreement of the Bioethics Committee of the Military Medical Chamber 
in Warsaw. 

The  main  aim  of  examination  of  group  A  patients  was  to 
determine  a  range  of  changes  in  values  characteristic  of  each  of  the 
instantaneous  potentials  and  to  calculate  their  interrelations.  The  values 
obtained served as a reference standard for verification of further results. 
On the basis of the examination of group B patients a spatial distribution 
of  potential  values  on  the  thorax  surface  was  calculated  for  each  of  the 
instantaneous  excitations  on  CM  depolarization.  The  results  of 
examination of group C patients were used to determine usefulness of the 
SATRO method in prediction of the myocardium perfusion disturbances, 
diagnosed  by  the  stress  perfusion  scintigraphy  (SPECT).  All  patients 
underwent  12  lead  ECG  examinations  whose  results  were  subjected  to 
SATRO analysis. 

Group A consisted of 183 people at the age of 45±15. 100 people 
were  in  good  physical  condition  (65  men  and  35  women)  with  no 
symptoms  of  cardiac  or  cardiovascular  system  disorders  or  any  risk 
factors of coronary heart diseases. The remaining 83 people (64 men and 
19 women) were patients whose SPECT examination did not reveal any 
perfusion  changes  only  in  some  areas  of  the  left  ventricle.  The 
instantaneous  potentials  corresponding  to  these  areas  were  taken  into 
consideration in establishment of the standard. 

Group B consisted of eight healthy men of a slim figure at the age 
25-28.  In  a  specially  prepared  room  these  men  were  subjected  to 
measurement  of  electrocardiographic  potentials  with  the  use  of  144 
disposable  electrodes  placed  on  the  whole  chest  surface.  Four  of  these 
electrodes  corresponded  to  the  limb  leads.  The  course  of  the  potential 
changes  was  recorded  subsequently  from  each  electrode  placed  in  the 

14 

 

 

middle of the element of the net with side lengths of 35mm horizontally 
and  50  mm  vertically,  as  shown  in  (Fig.  13).  All  the  courses  were 
analysed  with  the  use  of  the  SATRO  programme,  obtaining  precise 
parameters for each of ten instantaneous excitations whose duration was 
calibrated on the basis of the corresponding potentials from the lead II. 

The  third  group  consisted  of  86  people,  47  men  and  19  women 
suspected of the cardiac muscle ischemia, qualified for stress ECG on the 
grounds  of  recommendations  of  classes  I  or  II  b,  according  to  experts 
from  the  American  College  of  Cardiology  and  American  Heart 
Association [28, 29]. In the group, there were 20 men without any pain in 
the  chest  with  one  or  two  risk  factors  of  the  coronary  heart  disease.         
A  clinical  characteristic  of  this  group  was  made  and  the  type  of  ECG 
irregularities  in  the  range  of  ST-T  waves,  classified  according  to  the 
Minnesota Code [30] was determined. All persons from all groups were 
subjected to standard ECG and SATRO, SPECT and stress ECG. 

 

5.1. SATRO analysis of ECG signals 

12 lead ECG signals at rest were recorded on a standard apparatus 
permitting  measurements  in  the  frequency  band  corresponding  to  AHA 
norm for analog filtration (0.03 -100 Hz) and the sampling frequency of 
500 Hz. The results were analysed by the program SATRO based on the 
physical model presented above. Signals from each lead were normalized 
and  averaged  according  to  the  accepted  criteria,  and  the  isoelectric  line 
(zero) was determined on the basis of the T-P section of the ECG records 
obtained.  
 The  majority  of  biomedical  signals,  including  those  from  ECG,  are 
nonstationary  so  their  course  and  preliminary parameters of each of the 
instantaneous  potentials  were  estimated  in  the  time-frequency  signal 
representation.  Analysis  in  this  domain  was  possible  as  a  result  of            
a  numerical  operation  additionally  employing  some  algorithms 
permitting improvement of the resolution of this representation. A similar 
signal  conversion  procedure  was  described  in  detail  in  [31,  32]  and  the 
possibility of the resolution improvement was discussed in [33, 34]. The 
values of the parameters determining the potential magnitude were then 
optimised  to  get  the  best  possible  agreement  between  the  course  of  the 
resultant  function  (thick  solid  line  in  Fig.  7)  and  the  experimental  data 

15 

 

(•). Having taken into account the assumptions of the model presented in 
this  work,  the  optimisation  was  performed  by  the  two-phase  method 
based on the genetic algorithms [35, 36]. Fig. 7 presents the time courses 
of  all  potentials  appearing  on  CM  depolarization  and  only  ten  single-
phase  instantaneous  potentials.  Some  of  the  potentials  are  two-phase  in 
character, which illustrates the complexity of the QRS complex analysis 
by  SATRO.  As  a  result,  the  procedure  gave  the  accurate  values  of  the 
parameters  of  each  of  the  instantaneous  potentials  (-)  and  their 
components (--) originating from particular parts of an activated bundle. 
As  follows  from  the  analysis  of  the  QRS  complex  within  the  model 
proposed,  upon  depolarization  of  the  cardiac  ventricles  a  number  of 
instantaneous  activations  take  place.  Each  of  them  is  related  to                  
a  distribution  of  the  resultant  charge  density 
a given bundle (W,M,N).

Following  the  above  procedure 
the  signals  from  all  leads  of  the 
standard  ECG  were  analysed  and 
the  results  were  transformed  into 
the  orthogonal  Franck’s  system 
on  the  basis  of  the  empirical 
coefficients.  According 
the 
known  methods  of  determination 
of  the  electric  axis  of  the  cardiac 
muscle [37, 38] the angles made to it by the physical axes of the cardiac 
muscle (saggital, transversal and anatomical) were estimated. At the next 
step  the  orthogonal  system  was  transformed  to  the  coordinate  system 
based  on  the  anatomical  axes  of  the  cardiac  muscle  so  that  the  y  axis 
corresponded  to  the  long  anatomical  axis  and  the  z  axis  to  the  saggital 
axis.  The  transformations  employed  the  matrices  used  in  the  three-
dimensional  dextrorotatory  system  of  the  following  directions  of  the 
positive rotation [39]: 

to 

x → y,    y → z,     z → x 

(18) 

                                                 
In  each  case  the  coordinate  system  based  on  the  anatomical  axes  was 
oriented with respect to the orthogonal system so that the resulting angles 
were: 
• 
• 
• 

to the OX axis: -15.5°    (where “+” corresponds to Y -> Z) 
to the OY axis: -39.0°    (where “+” corresponds to X -> Z) 
to the OZ axis: -35.0°    (where “+” corresponds to X -> Y)

In  order  to  evaluate  changes  in  each  potential  generated  on  CM 
depolarization,  a  concept  of  instantaneous  electric  activity 
  was 

iV

introduced.  This  activity  is  measured  as  the  area  under  the  curve 
corresponding to a given instantaneous potential higher than 2x10-6 [V], 
in the units of 10-6[Vs]. The resultant activity 
 is calculated from eq.

The  SATRO  method  presented  in  this  paper  is  based  on  the  above-
described physical model and employs  a numerical analysis of standard 
ECG  signals.  The  obtained  accurate  parameters  describing  each  of  the 
instantaneous  potentials  are  compared  with  the  corresponding  values 
measured  for  healthy  patients,  treated  as  standards.  On  the  basis  of 
comparisons  of  the  disturbances  in  perfusion  in  individual  fragments  of 

18 

 

 

 
the  left  ventricle  determined  in  the  SPECT  with  the  changes  in 
zcV
calculated by the SATRO method a possibility was developed to estimate 
the performance of the following fragments of the left ventricle:  septum 
(PR),  anterior  wall  (ŚP),  inferior  wall  (ŚD),  lateral  wall  (ŚB),  posterior 
(ŚT)  and  the  apex  (K).  In  the  majority  of  the  patients  examined  a 
decrease  in  the  relative  instantaneous  electric  activity  in  at  least  one 
anatomical area by over 50% relative to the corresponding standard was 
interpreted as a positive result of SATRO. Final evaluation of the cardiac 
muscle  ischemia  was  made  on  the  basis  of  this  result  analysed  against 
other parameters describing this activation.  
 
 

5.2. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy SPECT 

Stress  ECG  was  performed  on  a  moving  track  according  to  the 
Bruce  protocol  [40].  The  heart  beat  frequency  was  established  by 
following the rule: 220/min − age of the patient in years. The workload 
was ceased on a positive result or – in patients with the negative result – 
on  reaching  the  maximum  heart  beat  frequency  or  on  detection  of 
absolute or relative indications of test termination [28]. The criterion of a 
positive result of the stress test was the horizontal or a skew decrease or 
an increase in the ST interval ST ≥ mm in at least one of the 12 leads of 
stress ECG [28]. 
The  rest-stress  myocardial  perfusion  scintigraphy  with  tomographic 
imaging  (SPECT)  was  made  using  methoxy-izobutyl-izonitrile  with 
Tc99m isotope as a label. The examination was performed at the Nuclear 
Medicine  Centre  of  the  Army  Medical  Centre  in  Warsaw  (headed  by 
Prof.  dr  hab.  med.  Eugeniusz  Dziuk)  and  at  the  Nuclear  Medicine 
Department  of  the  Institute  of  Cardiology  in  Warsaw  (headed  by  Dr. 
med. Anna Teresińska). In analysis of the results of SATRO, SPECT and 
stress ECG the frequency of the positive results obtained by each method 
was established and then a positive result of SPECT was predicted on the 
basis  of  the  results  of  SATRO  and  stress  ECG  and  the  prediction  was 
verified.  Moreover,  the  consistence  of  the  SPECT  and  SATRO  results 
was  tested  in  the  indication  of  perfusion  deficiency  localisation  by 
SPECT and regions of diminished electric activity by SATRO. 

19 

 

The interrelations between the results of SPECT, SATRO and stress ECG 
were evaluated by the logistic regression test and Spearman correlation. 
Statistical  analyses  were  made  using  the  Complete  Statistical  Systems 
packet  (Microsoft  Corporation,  USA).  The  sensitivity  of  SATRO  and 
stress ECG was calculated as the percent of persons with positive results 
in  the  group  of  persons  with  perfusion  disturbances  diagnosed  with 
SPECT.  The  sensitivity  and  specificity  of  SATRO  and  stress  ECG  was 
determined on the basis of a comparative analysis of the results obtained 
by  these  methods  with  those  obtained  by  stress  SPECT  for  the  patients 
diagnosed with disturbances of the cardiac muscle perfusion. Moreover, 
the consistency of the results obtained by SPECT and SATRO, that is the 
agreement  between  the  localisation  of  the  perfusion  deficiency  regions 
detected  by  SPECT  and  the  regions  of  diminished  electric  activity 
detected by SATRO, was evaluated. 
As follows from the Spearman correlation test, the correlation of SPECT 
results with those of SATRO was stronger (r =0.46, p<0.0001) than with 
those  of  stress  ECG  (r  =0.26,  p<0.02).  The  sensitivity  of  SATRO  in 
prediction  of  myocardial  perfusion  disturbances  was  100  %  and  the 
SATRO  specificity  was  46%.  After  some  correction  of  this  range  the 
sensitivity  was  93  %,  while  the  specificity  -  81%.  Values  of  these 
parameters for particular segments of the left ventricle are given below.  
 
6. Results 
 

This  paper  reports  only  some  selected  more  important  results 
needed  to  verify  the  assumptions  of  the  model  proposed.  A  detailed 
analysis  of  SATRO  results  and  discussion  of  the  advantages  of  its 
application  in  diagnosis  of  the  myocardial  ischemia  and  other  cardiac 
muscle conditions will be presented in separate papers.   
 

6.1. Standard parameters of instantaneous potentials 

 
On the basis of the results obtained for patients from group A, the 
characteristic parameters of ten instantaneous potentials appearing on the 
chest surface as a result of electric activation of particular CM segments 
were  calculated  by  the  SATRO  method.  They  bring  independent 
contributions to the total potential measured by ECG.

For  each  person  examined  the  instantaneous  potential  at  the  sixth 
activation W6 was significantly greater than the potentials corresponding 
to  the  other  activations  and  equalled  89.5  x  10-6  [V⋅  s]  on  average.  The 
confidence  intervals  did  not  exceed  15  %  of  their  values.  Table  II 
presents  the  durations  of  the  activations  and  the  calculated  confidence 
intervals.  The differences in the durations of activations are rather small, 
but the longest one of 52.3 x 10-3s characterises the sixth activation. The 
durations of the other activations fall within the range 38 ÷44 s.

The results obtained for healthy patients indicate that the time distances 
between  the  subsequent  potential  maxima  are  of  the  same  value. 
Moreover, in all healthy persons examined the contributions of particular 
instantaneous  activations  in  the  total  activation  of  the  cardiac  muscle 
were  also  of  the  same  value.  The  parameters  of  subsequent  potentials 
calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  results  obtained  for  the  healthy  persons 
were  treated  as  a  reference  standard.  The  reproducibility  of  results  was 
also evaluated on the basis of the results of a series of 30 measurements 
performed in a few minute intervals for each of the 80 of healthy persons. 
The deviation from the mean value did not exceed ±10%.   
 

6.2. Potential distribution on the chest surface 

Fig.9  presents  the  time  dependencies  of  the  electric  potentials 
measured on the chest surface of a healthy man of 25 years of age and of 
slim figure. Depending on the site of the electrode location, the potentials 
have  different  values  and  different  courses.  Each  of  them  was  analysed 
by SATRO to get the characteristic parameters describing the potentials. 
On  the  basis  of  the  electrical  activities  calculated  in  this  way  it  was 
possible to obtain a distribution of each of these potentials on the surface 
of  the  chest,  see  below.  For  the  sake  of  illustration,  Fig.9  presents  the 
mean amplitude of one of the potential corresponding to the 6th activation 
of  CM.  The  positive  and  negative  values  are  marked  in  red  and  blue, 
respectively.  On  the  front  of  the  chest  area  there  is  one  centre  of  the 
maximum potential amplitude of -1.60•10-3V, localised between the leads 
V1 and V2, and another one below the lead V4 of the potential amplitude 
of  +1.48•10-3V.    For  the  other  patients  from  this  group  the  potential 
distribution  on  the  chest  area  did  not  differ  significantly  from  that 
presented in Fig. 9.

6.3. Results of SPECT and SATRO 

 

Analysis of the SPECT results by two independent groups proved 
the  perfusion  deficiency  in  at  least  one  fragment  of  the  left  ventricle 
muscle  in  65%  of  the  patients  examined.  The  positive  SATRO  result 
corresponding to a decrease in the local electric activity was detected in 
78%  of  the  patients  from  the  same  group.  No  person  with  the  negative 
SATRO  result  was  diagnosed  with  the  perfusion  deficiency  in  SPECT. 
The  perfusion  deficiency  in  SPECT  and  the  reduced  electric  activity  in 
SATRO were observed most often in the inferior wall and least often in 
the  posterior  wall  of  the  cardiac  muscle.  A  comparative  analysis  of  the 
localisation  of  the  perfusion  deficiency  in  SPECT  and  reduced  electric 
activity  in  SATRO,  performed  for  a  total  number  of  430  anatomical 
segments of the left ventricle proved the agreement of the results in 75% 
of  the  anatomical  segments.  The  disturbances  in  the  electrical  activity 
measured by SATRO were assumed as significant when below 55% W(I) 
and  below  50%  W(II).  The  data  on  the  sensitivity,  specificity,  positive 
(+) and negative (-) diagnostic values of SATRO are presented in Table 
IV.

7. Analysis and discussion of results 
 

The  hitherto  known  descriptions  of 

the  potentials  whose 
appearance accompanies electric activation of ventricles have been based 
on  the  assumption  that  the  electric  dipoles  making  the  front  of  the 
depolarization  wave  move  along  certain  paths  in  the  cardiac  muscle.  A 
detailed  analysis  of  the  process  indicates  that  such  an  approach  dos  not 
give a coherent description of the physical phenomena taking place and is 
insufficient  for  evaluation  of  the  parameters  of  particular  activations.  It 
also fails to take into account the effect of physiological and pathological 
factors on the space-time distribution of instantaneous potentials.   

ot

In the model presented the process of the cardiac muscle depolarization 
is accompanied by the movement of the resultant electric charge producing the 
potential, along the fibres. The problem has been analysed by Clayton et al., 
[41]  who  studied  the  move  of  the  potential  along  the  single  fibre.  The 
distribution of each of the instantaneous potentials on the chest surface at a 
 depends on the physiological and pathological factors. The 
given time 
effect of physiological factors on the potential was evaluated taking into 
regard  different  parameters  related  to  the  structure  and  position  of  the 
cardiac muscle. Particular anatomical segments of the cardiac muscle are 
represented  by  characteristic  bundles.  Their  spatial  position  was 
described  in  the  orthogonal  system  of  coordinates,  see  Fig.  11.  The 
angles  (
 describe the bundle position in the system related directly 
to  the  patient  and  indicate  the  direction  of  propagation  of  the 
depolarization wave from the endocardium W towards the epicardium N. 
The distance between the centre of the bundle and the plane (XY)n tangent 
to the front of the chest is denoted by

The  absolute  value  of  the  potential  for  e.g.  =20  is  about  three  times 
higher than for the angle of 0. The potential distribution along the x axis 
at a distance  = 40 for the rotation angles 
 is 
of  a  completely  different  character  as  shown  in  (Fig.  12a).    Only  one 
extreme  of  the  potential  appears  (a  positive  or  a  negative  one).  In  fact, 
individual  bundles  of  CM  are  inclined  at  different  angles  and  are  at 
different distances from the measuring point, each brining its independent 
contribution  to  the  resultant  potentialϕ.  Each  bundle  has  a  characteristic 
number of fibres, which has been taken into account in the calculations in 
 related to the resultant charge density. (Fig. 
the value of the amplitude

different
amplitude  does  not  affect  the  positions  of  the  extreme  values  of  the 
potential with respect to the centres of the bundles. The spatial distribution 
of the potential does not depend on the size of the heart for the same angle

On  the  basis  of  the  assumptions  of  the  model  proposed,  the 
distributions of the values of each of the 10 instantaneous potential were 
calculated on the front and on the back of the chest, (Fig. 13). Particular 
distributions  were  determined  at  the  time  at  which  a  given  activation

The  number  of  points  on  the  plot  was  increased  by  the  Langrange 
interpolation  of  the  potential  measured,  whose  nodes  were  the  potential 
values  measured,  which  permitted  drawing  the  plot  to  an  accuracy  of 
1mm. To clarify the illustration the same colour intensity was used at the 
maximum value of each activation potential. The interrelations between 
the potentials can be estimated against a scale given below each figure. 
The insignificant differences between the potential distribution calculated 
on the basis of the model proposed and that obtained from measurements 
can be explained by assuming a linear structure of the CM bundles in the 
model. In fact some bundles can be somewhat curved.

Hitherto we have considered the spatial distribution of instantaneous 
potentials and at this point we shall focus on their time evolution. Assuming 
the model proposed an analysis has been made of time dependencies of each 
of the instantaneous potentials at a given site. Recently much attention has 
been  devoted  to  the  differences  in  the  shape,  duration  and  electro-
physiological  properties  of  the  action  potentials  produced  by  the  working 
fibres of particular segments of the ventricles [24, 25, 42]. Results of the 
hitherto  studies  have  shown 
the 
subendocardial (W) and the M cells starts almost at the same time, which is 
probably related to the penetration of a certain number of Purkinje fibres 
deep  under  the  endocardium    [43].  The  activation  of  the  cells  in  the 
subepicardium  is  a  little  delayed.  The  duration  of  the  potential  at  the 
activated M cells is slightly longer than at the other bundle parts because 
these  cells  make  almost  40%  of  the  whole  bundle  [44].  Following  the 
above  time  relation,  Fig.  14a  presents  the  time  evolution  of  the  resultant 
potential 
)t(ϕ   of  one  of  the  CM  bundles,  calculated  at  the  site  P(x,y,z), 
represented  by  the  thick  solid  line  (⎯).  The  potential  time  evolution 
)t(ϕ is mainly affected by the properties of the particular parts W, M and 
N, marked by different type curves (---,⎯,•••,). The time
, at which the 
potential 
)t(ϕ reaches a maximum value, is marked by a vertical line. The 
)t(ϕ in Fig. 14a was calculated and assumed as   
area (P) under the curve 
a  100%  in  further  analysis.  Subsequent  figures  (Fig.14b,  14c  and  14d) 
show the effect of the activities of particular parts of the bundle (W, M, N) 
)t(ϕ course.  For 
on  the  value  of  P, 
example,  the  neglect  of  the  potential  produced  at  the  subendocardial  part 
(W) of a given segment of CM (Fig. 14b) results in a decrease in the area 

  time  and  the  character  of  the

under  the  f(t)  curve  P  by  about  40%,  and  the  time  of  reaching  the 
maximum potential values is by about 2x10-3 s longer. If the M type cells 
do not take part in the depolarization, (Fig. 14c), the area P decreases by 
about 34 % and the time 

 remains the same.

The values of the instantaneous potentials and times after which they reach 
maximums depend on the contribution of particular parts of the bundle in 
the  activation  process.  Within  the  model  proposed  it  is  also  possible  to 
analyse  different  combinations  of  contributions  of  each  of  the  in  parts, 
including  the  effect  of  the  amplitude  of  partial  potentials  on  the  value  of

difference  in  the  rate  of  the  ion  movements  in  the  regions  I  and  II  is 
significant, the dependence 
)t(ϕ  can also have a two-phase character, see 
(Fig. 15b).

Actually, the probability of such a situation is very low, but its occurrence 
cannot be excluded. On the basis of the model presented, the time courses 
of the instantaneous potential appearing around the bundle of fibres can be 
of  one-  or  two-phase  character,  depending  on  the  position  relative  to  the 
centre  of  the  bundle.  The  time  courses  are  shown  in  (Fig.  16).  A  detail 
analysis  of  the  instantaneous  potentials  by  SATRO  is  made  taking  into 
account  all  the  possibilities  that  can  occur  simultaneously  and  bring 

different contributions.

bundle performance and thus to the performance of a given segment of the 
cardiac  muscle.  Individual  CM  bundles  are  activated  at  different  time 
moments  and  bring  their  own  contributions  to  the  potential  appearing 
around the heart in a strictly determined sequence. Different parameters of 
each bundle and their mutual spatial arrangement implied by the structure 
of the cardiac muscle give rise to some anisotropic changes in the physical 
quantities at the chest area.  
A  comprehensive  discussion  needs  to  take  into  regard  the  dielectric 
properties of the human body on the electric potential measured.  
 In view of the fact that in the model proposed we use the arbitrary values 
and units and that the dielectric characteristics of the medium – a human 
body - for the real values of the parameters measured can be assumed as 
linear, the above equations are sufficient for our purposes. Nevertheless, 
these  relations  are  not 
it  should  be  remembered 
complicated,  it  is  practically  impossible  to  find  an  exact  analytical 
expression  for  the  potential,  despite  the  assumed  one-dimensional 
character  of  the  model  of  each  individual  fibre.  This  impossibility  is 
implied by the real form of the functions describing the densities of the 
positive  and  negative  potentials  and  the  geometry  of  the  system.  The 
problem is the form of the integrals describing the potential as a function 
of charge density of the fibres.  Moreover, the total potential reflected by 
the  signal  measured  is  a  sum  of  potentials  from  the  resultant  charges  in 
individual  fibres.  Taking  all  this  into  account  would  require  finding  a 
compact  analytical  solution  of  the  expression  written  for  the  limits  of 
integrations  determined  by  the  positions  of  the  beginnings  and  ends  of 
each fibre and the summation should be performed over all fibres from the 
area  of  interest.  Moreover,  for  each  fibre  we  will  have  to  find  an 
appropriate integral taking into account that each fibre has a little different 
geometry  and  different  time  of  the  processes  taking  place  in  it,  so  the 
integration  limits  should  be  different  for  each  fibre.  However,  it  is 
possible to calculate numerically the potentials and hence the parameters 
of interest to us, to a satisfactory accuracy.   
  
The model proposed describes not only electric but also magnetic 
properties. Because of the numerical character of the method SATRO it is 
also possible to investigate the distribution of magnetic fields accompanying 
the  activations.  The  problem  is  very  interesting;  however,  it  is  beyond  the 
scope of this work and will be a subject of a separate paper.  

33 

 

The results obtained by SATRO for the patients from group A have 
revealed  significant  differences  in  the  electric  activity  in  particular  CM 
segments at small differences in durations of the activations. The appearances 
of the minimum or the maximum values of the instantaneous potential also 
occur  at  the  same  time  intervals.  This  observation  would  suggest  that  the 
electric  activity  of  particular  segments  of  the  ventricles  comes  from  the 
activated CM bundles of a different number of fibres and slightly different 
lengths. The inferior wall is the only segment of the left ventricle represented 
by  a  single  although  the  thickest  bundle,  which  may  be  related  to  the 
occurrence of great number of infarcts in this segment.  

Electrocardiographic  diagnostics  of  ischemia  or  hypoxia  of  the 
cardiac  muscle  usually  takes  into  account  the  localisation  of  the  ST 
segments and the shape of the T wave. A characteristic feature indicating 
ischemia is a depression of the ST segments, while hypoxia is reflected 
by  elevation  of  this  segment,  but  the  latter  has  lower  diagnostic  value.  
Each  of  the  features  is  relatively  little  sensitive  and  little  specific 
manifestation  of  ischemia,  in  particular  if  the  ECG  was  recorded  in  the 
period  when  the  patient  suffered  no  pain  and  belonged  to  a  group  of 
persons in which the probability of coronary arteries disease estimated on 
the basis of the sex and age was low.  

Small  diagnostic  value  of  the  ECG  components  related  to  the 
repolarization  of  the  muscles  of  the  ventricles  prompts  to  consider  the 
possibility  of  using  the  process  of  the  ventricle  depolarization  for  the 
purpose. In the ischemic region of the cardiac muscle the content of ATP 
and  creatine  phosphokinase  decreases,  while  the  concentration  of 
potassium,  lactates  and  fatty  acids  in  the  extracellular  space  increases 
[45-47].  An  increased  concentration  of  extracellular  potassium  has  an 
important  effect  on  the  electrophysiological  properties  of  the  ischemic 
muscle fibres. According to the experimental evidence, the accumulation 
of potassium ions caused by ischemia decreases the absolute value of the 
potential  at  rest  and  the  rate  of  phase  0  increases  together  with  the 
amplitude  of  the  action  potential  [47,48],  and  decreases  the  values  of 
electric  potentials  generated  in  the  depolarization  phase  of  the  ischemic 
region of the ventricular muscle.  

The  disturbances  in  the  process  of  depolarization  related  to 
ischemia  are  reflected  in  the  shape  of  the  QRS  complexes.  However, 
when the region affected by ischemia is small, this effect can be difficult 
or impossible to detect by standard evaluation and interpretation of ECG 

34 

 

inspection  of 

the  changes  can  be  difficult  on  visual 

recording. Hitherto much attention has been paid to the broadening of the 
QRS complexes as a result of ischemia. Michaelides et al. [49] reported a 
correlation  between  the  degree  of  broadening  of  the  QRS  complexes  in 
stress ECG and the number of narrowed coronary arteries and the number 
of segments of the felt ventricle manifesting disturbances in contractility 
in  isotope  ventriculography.  According  to  the  authors,  the  range  of 
broadening of the QRS complex as a result of ischemia is relatively small 
and 
the 
electrocardiogram. For instance in the group of 150 persons examined by 
Michaelides  et  al.,  [49]  the  QRS  complex  broadening  on  stress  was  on 
average  4.8  x  10-3s  in  the  patients  with  significant  narrowing  of  one 
coronary  artery,  7.8  x  10-3s  in  the  patients  with  narrowing  of  two 
coronary arteries and 13.3 x 10-3s in the patients with narrowing of three 
coronary arteries. Such an insignificant broadening of the QRS complex 
can  be  explained  by  a  decrease  in  the  potential  of  some  instantaneous 
activations, because, as follows from the model presented, hypoxia leads 
to a shortening of the activations and not to their elongation. The cardiac 
muscle  cells  contain  a  large  number  of  mitochondria,  so  almost  all 
energy is released as a result of oxidation of nutrients and the anaerobic 
processes have no importance. The deficiency of oxygen causes a delay 
of  the  charge  transfer  along  the  fibres  in  area  II,  which  reduces  the 
resultant charge density and thus also the potential measured. However, 
this  has  no  effect  on  the  propagation  rate  of  the  resultant  wave  of  the 
charge density wave. The situation is different when one of the parts of 
the bundle does not take part in depolarization. Then, the effective length 
of the bundle is shortened, hence, the time of the activation and the value 
of  the  potential  generated  also  decrease.  Therefore,  there  is  a  strict 
relation  between  the  ischemia  of  a  given  segment  and  the  value  of  the 
resultant potential and duration of a relevant activation.  
The evidence of depolarization disturbances related to hyperpotasemia in 
the  region  with  ischemia  reported  by  different  researchers  [47,  48,  50, 
51] supports the correctness of the theoretical assumptions of the SATRO 
method.  The  proposed  analysis  of  instantaneous  variation  of  the 
depolarization  potentials  at  particular  sites  in  the  left  ventricle  muscle 
extends the diagnostic possibilities of the non-invasive methods used for 
diagnosis  of  the  cardiac  muscle  ischemia.  A  comparative  study  of  the 
results obtained by the proposed method SATRO, stress ECG and SPECT 
performed  on  the  whole  group  of  patients  studied,  has  shown  a  much 

35 

 

greater correlation between the SATRO and SPECT results than between 
the stress ECG and SPECT. Such a good agreement between the results 
of SATRO and SPECT follows from the fact that both methods bring the 
information  on  the  state  of  CM,  and  effects  of  the  disturbances  in  
intraventricular conduction and other diseases leading to local damage to 
muscle  fibres,  Purkinje  fibres  or  Purkinje  junction  on  the  parameters 
analysed  in  both  methods  are  the  same.  For  this  reason,  the  results 
obtained  by  the  method  SATRO  and  stress  ECG  were  referred  to  the 
stress  SPECT  results  and  not  to  those  of  the  angiography  of  coronary 
arteries. 
 
8. Concluding remarks 

 

Investigation  of  instantaneous  potentials,  appearing  on  the  chest 
surface on depolarisation of the cardiac muscle, required development of 
a new model describing generation of the resultant electric charge density 
and  new  software  permitting  detailed  analysis  of  the  ECG  signals. 
Changes in the charge density were described by mathematical formulae 
and  the  resultant  distribution  of  potentials  was  then  compared  to  the 
experimental results.  
The model assumed describes in a coherent way the space-time relations 
between  the  potentials  appearing  on  the  cardiac  muscle  depolarisation 
taking into account the pathological and physiological factors.  

Analysis  of  the  ECG  records  by  the  SATRO  program  enables          

a detection of even small changes in the instantaneous potentials appearing 
as  a  result  of  activation  of  a  given  fragment  of  the  cardiac  muscle.  This 
potentiality  indicates  a  possible  application  of  the  method  proposed  for 
detection and evaluation of early ischemia in individual fragments of the 
cardiac muscle.  

As  has  been  evidenced,  the  diagnostic  worth  of  SATRO  in 
prediction  of  disturbances  in  the  myocardial  perfusion  diagnosed  by 
SPECT is much greater than that of classical ECG. 
The conclusions following from the model and the method proposed, its 
analysis and tests of its diagnostic worth are given below: 
 
 

36 

 

1.  The  appearance  of  potentials  at  particular  fragments  of  the  cardiac  muscle 
can  be  explained  by  analysis  of  changes  in  the  electric  charge  in  three-
component (W, M, N) bundle of conducting fibres.   

2. Each bundle represents a separate anatomical fragment of the cardiac muscle 
(ventricular septum, anterior wall, posterior wall, inferior wall, lateral wall, 
etc.) and is an independent source of instantaneous potential.  

3.  The  QRS  complex  appears  as  a  result  of  summation  of  all  instantaneous 
potentials generated on depolarisation of particular fragments of the cardiac 
muscle.  

4. The value of instantaneous potential depends on the properties and activities 

of individual parts (W, M, N) of a bundle.   

5. Time changes in the value and distribution of the potential appearing on the 
surface of the chest depends on physiological and pathological factors.  
6.  Electric  activity  of  each  particular  fragment  of  the  cardiac  muscle  of  the 
healthy  person  makes  a  constant  percent  contribution  in  the  total  cardiac 
muscle activity.   

7.  Particular  activities  of  a  value  lower  than  50  %  of  the  healthy  person 
(standard)  well  correlate  with  disturbances  in  perfusion  observed  in  stress 
SPECT. 

8.  A  reduced  amount  of oxygen in the cardiac muscle significantly affects the 
resultant  electric  charge  density  and  leads  to  a  reduced  electric  potential 
generated on the cardiac muscle activity.   

9.  The  diagnostic  worth  of  SATRO  examination  in  predicting  disturbances  in 
the  cardiac  muscle  perfusion  diagnosed  with  stress  SPECT  is  greater  than 
that of stress ECG.  

10. High sensitivity of SATRO in prediction of the positive result of stress 
SPECT indicates a possibility of its application as a screening test in 
detection of the cardiac muscle ischemia.

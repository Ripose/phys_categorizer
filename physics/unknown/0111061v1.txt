Abstract

Orbit  feedback  system  plays  crucial  roles  for  the
operation  of  the  3rd  generation  light  source.  There  are
various  issues  in  orbit  feedback  system  should  be
addressed  to  achieve  ultimate  performance.  The  orbit
feedback system in SRRC is upgraded recently to satisfy
the  requirement  of  demanding  users.  Based  upon
operational experiences of the last few years, new system
was  designed  with  more  robustness  and  flexibility.
Performance analysis tools are also developed to monitor
system  performance.  Algorithms  for  feedback  control,
data  acquisition  and  analysis  are  described  and
measurement is also presented.

1  INTRODUCTION
Orbit  feedback  system  is  used  to  eliminate  orbit
excursion  due  to  various  perturbation  sources.  Work  to
improve  orbit  stability  start  form  1995  with  the  orbit
feedback  system.  This  orbit  feedback  system  has  been
applied  incorporate  with  the  insertion  devices  operation,
include  undulator  (U5  and  U9)  and  elliptical  polarized
low
undulator  (EPU5.6).  Suppress  orbit  drift  and 
frequency oscillation is also achieved. The orbit feedback
system  for  the  storage  ring  of  SRRC  is  in  upgrading  to
improve  its  performance.  The  effort  include  of  increase
feedback bandwidth, increasing sampling rate, compensate
eddy  current  effect  of  vacuum  chamber  with  filter,  and
enhance performance and robustness of the control rules.
In  this  report,  we  will  summary  status  of  the  orbit
feedback development in SRRC.

2  EXISTING ORBIT FEEDBACK SYSTEM
A  digital  orbit  feedback  system  [1,2]  had  been
developed to suppress orbit disturbances caused by long-
term  drift,  low-frequency  oscillation  and  perturbation
come  from  insertion  devices  operation.  First,  a  linear
response  matrix  is  measured  by  taking  electron  beam
position  monitor  (BPM)  reading  when  the  corrector  is
individually perturbed. Then, this response matrix is used
to  design  a  local  orbit  bump.  The  feedback  controller  is
based on PID algorithm. Digital filtering techniques were
used  to  remove  noise  of  electron  beam  position  reading,
to  compensate  eddy  current  effect  of  vacuum  chamber,
and  to  increase  bandwidth  of  orbit  feedback  loop.  The
infrastructure  of  digital  orbit 
is
composed of orbit acquisition system, gigabit fiber links,
digital  signal  processing  hardware  and  software,  high
precision  digital-to-analog  converters.  From  control
points  of  view,  The  orbit  feedback  is  a  typical  multiple

orbit  feedback  system

Technically,  it  is  difficult  to  implement  an  analog  matrix
operation  consisting  of  large  amount  of  BPMs  and
correctors. Consequently, digital based feedback system is
a natural way to implement orbit feedback system.

There are two orbit feedback system in this control loop.
One  is  local  feedback,  and  another  is  global  feedback.
Integrating 
for  better
coordination.  System  bandwidth  of  10  -  100  Hz  is
necessary  to  suppress  vibration  and  power  supply  ripple
related  beam  motion,  etc.    The  feedback  system  is
integrated with the existed control system. BPMs data and
correctors  readback  are  updated  into  control  system
dynamic  database  in  the  period  of  100  msec.  Digital
feedback system is bounded on I/O as well as computation.
It is important to arrange the real time task and to arbitrate
computer  bus  properly  in  order  to  optimize  system
performance.

2.1 Hardware structure

The  hardware  configuration  of  the  corrector  control
system in SRRC is shown in Figure 2. The low layer is a
VME crate system includes a PowerPC 604e CPU board
and  I/O  interface  cards.  The  front-end  devices  are
connected  to  this  system  via  analog  and  digital  I/Os.  A
PowerPC  based  server  system  is  used  as  the  TFTP  file
server for downloads OS and mounted disk of network file
server  (NFS).  All  application  programs  are  put  on  server
disk.  These  programs  are  developed  and  debugged  on
client  node  to  relief  loading  of  server.  The  real-time
multi-tasking  kernel  on  the  VME  bus  single  board
computer provided a satisfactory performance, reliability,
and a rich set of system services. New device is easy to be
created by that only modify device table file as if on line
editing.  The  system  can  automatically  boot  and  execute

different  applications  in  every  VME  node  with  the  same
operation  system  environments.  The  upload  process
handle  device  (analog  input)  and  send  acquisition  data  to
database  when  receives  the  broadcast  upload  message
from the Ethernet in every 0.1 second. The sampling rate
of the feedback loop is 1 kHz by VME interrupt.

Figure 2. Hardware architecture of the orbit feedback
system.

Present  system  consists  of  two  VME  crates,  orbit
server  VME  crate,  corrector  and  DSP  VME  crate.  Orbit
server  in  charge  to  acquire  BPM  data  every  1  msec  and
transfer  the  BPM  data  to  corrector  node  by  the  aid  of
reflective  memory.  The  host  processor  are  also  provide
average BPM reading and update to control database every
100 msec, the average number is programmable. A JTAG
emulator  is  used  for  the  development  of  DSP  program.
The bus adapter is fit onto slot 1 of VME crate as system
controller.  Feedback  software  were  developed  and
debugged  on  PC  and  downloaded  to  DSP  board  via  front
panel  JTAG  port.  The  DSP  board  carrying 
two
TMS320C40  TIM  modules  handle  all  signal  processing,
including  a  digital  low  pass  filter  and  PID  controller.  It
takes 1 ms to complete feedback processes including data
input,  operation  of  PID,  digital  low  pass  filtering,  matrix
operation, BPMs data reading and corrector settings. The
corrector setting had been applied to multi-channel 16 bit
DACs  with  sub-m rad  steering  resolution.  It  is  allowed
remotely  adjusted  the  corrector  setting  from  graphical
users interface during feedback loop is turn on.

Intrinsically,  the  performance  of  feedback  system  is
limited by BPM and PBPM resolution. The PBPM data is
directly acquired from multi-channel electrometer by A/D
channel of VME crate, which are distributed in beam line.
These crates are used as PBPM server node. It contain that
PowerPC 604, reflective memory and 16 bit A/D card in
each crate. The upper plate and low plate signals of PBPM
are  sent  to  PowerPC  with  VME  bus.  The  vertical  signals

are  sent  to  RM  with  PMC  bus  after  transformation
processing of two plates. This loop is synchronized with 1
ms  PMC  interrupt  that  is  requested  by  server  crate  with
RM  and  fiber  link.  There  is  133  Mbytes  per  second  data
communication in PMC bus, so it is provided for PBPM
data transfer quickly and largely. All data are collected to
BPM  server  node.  The  orbit  server  provides  fast  beam
position information to be used for feedback loop. It also
provides  slow  orbit  information  for  centralized  database.
The fast orbit information is sent to corrector via gigabit
fiber linked reflective memory and computation needs in
the VME crates.

The corrector node is supplied to corrector control with
PowerPC, 16 bit D/A card and DSP card. The structure of
application  software  is  described  in  Figure  3.  There  are
some  service  tasks  in  PowerPC.  The  setting  task  handles
corrector  setting  when  setting  command  arrived  from
database.  It  spawns  child  tasks  to  process  all  setting
requests  corresponding  tasks  to  each  incoming  UPD
facility setting packet. The reading process is triggered by
the external 10 Hz clock from network when receives the
broadcast  upload  message  from  Ethernet.  And  sends  an
event  to  wake  up  the  data  acquisition  process.  The  data
acquisition process is directly controller by remote login.
The  increased  I/O  card  is  easily  updated  by  modified
configure  table  file.  All  acquired  data  are  broadcast  to
Ethernet in every 100 ms. The DDB process is server of
shared  memory  that  is  coordinate  the  communication
between  reading  process  and  setting  process.  It  is  also
provided the data access from another process.

3  A EXAMPLE APPLICATION OF THE
ORBIT FEEDBACK SYSTEM
Changing gap and phase parameters of insertion devices
is  essential  in  the  operation  scenario  of  a  modern  light
source. Residue field of the insertion devices is the major

perturbation  source  led  to  orbit  excursion.  It  is  hard  to
eliminate  by  lookup  table  compensation  scheme.  In
routine  operation  of  the  storage  ring,  look-up  table
scheme  is  used  to  reduce  orbit  excursion  and  orbit
feedback system is to keep the orbit change within micron
level.  During  the  gap  change  of  U5  (4-meters  undulator
with  5  cm  period),  orbit  change  due  to  field  error.  The
orbit changed without and with global orbit feedback while
adjusting  the  U5  gap  as  indicated  in  Figure  4.  The
difference orbit is defined to be the orbit changed at 100
m m and 40mm from 219mm of U5 gap. The displacement
of orbit was much smaller when the digital global feedback
was turned on in comparison with the case when it was off.

4 ORBIT FEEDBACK SYSTEM UPGRADE
Upgrading of the orbit feedback system is underway. It
is  planed  that  the  new  system  will  put  into  operation  at
early 2002. There is several reason of the upgrade: Firstly,
to  improve  system  maintainability  and  stability.  The  DSP
board of the original feedback system is embedded in the
corrector  control  VME  crate.  It  is  inconvenient  for  the
development  of 
interference
between  machine  operation  and  feedback  loop  R&D  is  a
is
troublesome  problem.  Secondly, 
implemented 
the
functionality of the feedback loop is limited. There are not
enough computing power to handle the increase demand of
the number of BPMs and correctors. Selection of control
algorithm is also limited. In new implementation, the DSP
board is located on a separate VME crate. Ethernet based
DSP development system was selected to provide remote
access capability. The corrector node is loose coupled to
the  DSP  VME  crate.  There  are  three  VME  crates  in  the
upgraded  system:  BPM  node,  corrector  node  and  DSP
node.  These  three  nodes  are  connected  by  reflective
memory. Several of the fiber link reflective memory cards
are  tight  together  by  one  dedicated  reflective  hub  that
simplifies the wiring of the fiber link. The corrector node
handles  power-supply  control.  The  DSP  node  handles

interface  connection  of 

feedback  control,
graphic 
calculation  of  control  algorithm  and  signal  conversion
from  orbit  information  to  correction  of  corrector.  The
correction  value  results  are  sent  to  corrector  node  and
notice the host processor of corrector node by interrupt.
The  functional  block  diagram  is  shown  in  Figure  5.  The
planed photon BPM information is sent to DSP node by a
private  fast  Ethernet  network.  Local  data  acquisition  for
PBPMs are planed to used compact PCI crate system. In
the  meantime,  these  data  are  sent  to  database  of  console
level with control network.

The  optical  klystron  enhancement  to  self-amplified  spontaneous  emission  (SASE)  free 
electron  lasers  (FELs)  is  studied  in  theory  and  in  simulations.  In  contrast  to  a  seeded 
FEL,  the  optical  klystron  gain  in  a  SASE  FEL  is  not  sensitive  to  any  phase  mismatch 
between the radiation and the microbunched electron beam. The FEL performance with 
the  addition  of  four  optical  klystrons  located  at  the  undulator  long  breaks  in  the  Linac 
Coherent Light Source (LCLS) shows significant improvement if the uncorrelated energy 
spread at the undulator entrance can be controlled to a very small level. In addition, FEL 
saturation at shorter x-ray wavelengths (around 1.0 Å) within the LCLS undulator length 
becomes possible. We also discuss the application of the optical klystron in a compact x-
ray FEL design that employs relatively low electron beam energy together with a short-
period undulator.

I Introduction 
 
An  x-ray  free  electron  laser  (FEL)  operated  in  the  self-amplified  spontaneous  emission 
(SASE) mode is the primary candidate for the next-generation light source and is under 
active development around the world [1,2,3]. In such a device, a high-brightness electron 
beam passing a long undulator develops energy and density modulations at the radiation 
wavelength and consequently amplifies the spontaneous emission  into  intense,  coherent

radiation.  Based  on  the  achievable  electron  beam  qualities  such  as  peak  current  and 
transverse  emittances,  the  total  length  of  the  undulator  required  to  reach  the  x-ray 
intensity saturation usually exceeds 100 m. The electron beam energy spread is typically 
too small to affect the SASE performance.  
 
To enhance the FEL gain, the optical klystron concept has been invented by Vinokurov 
and Skrinsky [4] and has been successfully implemented in many FEL oscillator facilities 
such as the Duke FEL [5]. An optical klystron consists of two undulators, separated by a 
dispersive  section  (a  magnetic  chicane).  The  dispersive  section  converts  beam  energy 
modulation  into  density  modulation  and  hence  speeds  up  the  gain  process.  Theoretical 
studies  of  the  optical  klystron  in  high  gain  FEL  amplifiers  [6,7,8]  show  that  its 
performance depends critically on the electron beam energy spread. More recently, Neil 
and Freund [9] have studied a distributed optical klystron configuration using the LCLS 
parameters. Based on the FEL amplifier simulations that start with a coherent seed, they 
point out that the performance of the optical klystron for short-wavelength FELs is very 
sensitive  to  the  exact  slippage  of  the  electron  beam  relative  to  the  radiation  in  the 
dispersive  section.  Thus,  the  magnetic  fields  of  the  chicane  must  be  carefully  designed 
and controlled to very high precision. 
 
Motivated  by  the  very  small  uncorrelated  energy  spread  of  the  electron  beam  that  has 
been  measured  in  a  photocathode  rf  gun  [10],  we  study  the  possible  optical  klystron 
enhancement  to  SASE  x-ray  FELs.  In  Sec.  II,  we  generalize  the  previous  high-gain 
optical klystron theory to a SASE FEL having a wide bandwidth. We show that a SASE 
optical klystron is not sensitive to the relative phase of the electron beam to the radiation 
as long as the electron slippage length in the dispersive section is much longer than the 
coherence length of the radiation. In Sec. III, we use the LCLS as a typical x-ray FEL and 
discuss the evolution and the control of the uncorrelated energy spread in the accelerator 
and  the  undulator.  Based  on  extensive  SASE  simulations,  we  illustrate  the  gain 
enhancement of the optical klystron to the LCLS and apply this method to extend its x-
ray  wavelength  reach.  We  also  discuss  the  application  of  the  optical  klystron  in  a 
compact  x-ray  FEL  design  that  employs  relatively  low  beam  energy  together  with  a 
shorter-period undulator. Finally, we summarize our studies and conclude that the optical 
klystron is a promising approach to enhance the x-ray FEL performance.   
 
II. One-dimensional analysis 
 
In  this  section,  we  analyze  an  optical  klystron  configuration  with  a  magnetic  chicane 
between two high-gain FEL undulators and extend the previous theoretical treatments [6-
8] to the SASE operating mode. Saldin et al. recently consider an FEL klystron amplifier 

that uses an uncompressed electron bunch with a relatively low current and an extremely 
small  energy  spread  [11].  Thus,  the  first  undulator  in  their  proposal  is  a  pure  energy 
modulator (no gain in radiation), while the density modulation is generated only after the 
beam  passes  the  chicane.  Although  their  proposal  is  conceptually  simple,  the  relatively 
low current of the electron beam is not capable of driving a hard x-ray FEL. Thus, in this 
and  the  following  sections,  we  focus  our  attention  on  the  study  of  optical  klystrons  in 
high-gain x-ray FELs.  
  
A  magnetic  chicane  introduces  an  energy-dependent  longitudinal  delay  of  the  electron 
relative to the radiation, which can be expressed as a change of the radiation phase “seen” 
by the electron:

relative to the radiation due to the chicane. For extremely small beam energy spread the 

second  term  (microbunching)  dominates  over  the  first  term  (radiation),  and  there  is  no 
need for phase matching between the two terms. For the optical klystron FELs considered 
in  this  paper,  the  energy  spread  practically  limits  the  amount  of  the  microbunching 
induced by the chicane, and hence both terms in Eq. (2) must be taken into account. For a 
 (n = 1,2,3,…), this yields a nearly matched phase

(i.e., constructive interference between two terms). The optical klystron is then optimized 
as assumed in Refs. [6-8]. However, in the hard x-ray wavelength range, changing R56 of 
the chicane by a fraction of 1 Angstrom can result in a complete phase mismatch. Thus, 
there  can  be  large  fluctuations  in  the  radiation  power  due  to  small  fluctuations  in  the 
magnetic fields as observed in Ref. [9], especially when more than one optical klystron is 
used in a distributed optical klystron configuration.     
 
Nevertheless,  SASE  FELs  start  from  shot  noise  and  have  a  relatively  wide  bandwidth. 
For a given value of R56, the phase may be mismatched for one particular wavelength but 
may be properly matched for another wavelength within the SASE bandwidth. Thus, we 
should integrate over the SASE spectrum S(ν) to obtain the optical klystron power gain 
factor as:

where D = krR56ρ. The power gain factor G as a function of the chicane strength R56 is 
shown in Fig. 1 for two typical  values of the rms energy spread σδ, assuming a typical 
rms SASE bandwidth σν = ρ. When R56 is very small, the optical klystron operates as a 
phase shifter, and the FEL power is oscillatory depending on the relative phase between 
rk R δσ → , the optical klystron gain peaks and 
the radiation and the electron beam. As 
56
starts to decay exponentially due to the smearing effect of the intrinsic energy spread. In 

1

addition, the power oscillation damps with increasing R56. Thus, the phase matching is no 
longer important when the optical klystron is near its peak performance. As the optimal 
rk R δσ ,  the  damping  of  the  last  (oscillatory)  term  in  Eq.(5)  is 
R56  is  given  by
effective when D=krR56ρ >> 1. The last inequality is always satisfied since σδ << ρ is a 
necessary condition for the application of a high-gain optical klystron [6]. Thus, we can 
always ignore the last term in Eq. (5) and arrive at a simplified gain formula as

A  simple  physical  picture  emerges  in  the  time  domain.  The  path  length  difference 
between the SASE radiation and the electron beam passing the dispersive section is about 
  at  the  optimal  chicane  setting.  Since  the  typical  SASE

coherence  length  is  on  the  order  of 

rλ πρ [13,14],  it  is  much  smaller  than  the  path 
length difference introduced by the chicane for the beam with σδ << ρ. Therefore, there is 
no place for the electron beam to match the radiation phase after the beam is slipped from 
the SASE radiation more than a few temporal spikes. The radiation power averaged over 
many  statistically  independent  spikes  is  then  not  sensitive  to  the  exact  slippage 
introduced by the chicane. This feature distinguishes an optical klystron in a SASE FEL 
from  that  in  a  seeded  FEL,  which  is  always  subject  to  phase  matching  unless  the 
dispersively enhanced microbunching dominates over the radiation by more than an order 
of magnitude.  
 
III. Three-dimensional simulations 
 
In  this  section,  we  first  study  the  evolution  and  the  control  of  the  uncorrelated  energy 
spread in the accelerator and the undulator, which plays a crucial role in determining the 
optical klystron performance. We then use three-dimensional (3D) simulations to explore 
the  LCLS  gain  enhancement  with  a  distributed  optical  klystron  configuration  for  two 
different radiation wavelengths of 1.5 Å and 1.0 Å. The phase of one optical klystron is 
independently  varied  in  the  simulations  in  order  to  verify  that  the  output  power  is  not 
sensitive  to  any  phase  mismatch,  as  predicted  in  the  above  1D  analysis.  Finally,  we 
discuss the optical klystron enhancement to a compact x-ray FEL using a relatively low-
energy beam together with a short-period undulator. 
 
A. Uncorrelated energy spread of the LCLS beam 
 

As discussed in the 1D analysis, the uncorrelated energy spread plays a crucial role for 
ρσδ << ,  we 
the  gain  enhancement  of  the  optical  klystron.  To  satisfy  the  condition
analyze  the  smallest  possible  energy  spread  for  the  LCLS  electron  beam.  Two  main 
sources of energy spread are considered, one is from the gun and the linac, which forms 
the  initial  energy  spread  at  the  entrance  of  the  FEL  undulator;  while  the  other  is  the 
quantum  diffusion  due  to  spontaneous  radiation  along  the  undulator,  which  leads  to  an 
increase of energy spread after the electron beam is injected into the undulator. Since the 
proposed optical klystrons operate in the early stage of the exponential regime, the FEL-
induced energy spread is negligible (but is included in the simulations). 
 
The uncorrelated energy spread of electron beams generated from a photocathode rf gun 
can be extremely small, at an rms value of 3 to 4 keV from both measurements [10] and 
analysis[15].  Nevertheless,  a  microbunching  instability  driven  by  coherent  synchrotron 
radiation [16,17,18,19] and longitudinal space charge [20,21] in the accelerator system 
may  be  large  enough  to  significantly  degrade  the  beam  qualities  including  the  energy 
spread. This microbunching instability occurs at much longer wavelengths than the FEL 
microbunching and requires much larger R56 (from bunch compressor chicanes) than the 
optical klystron chicanes. To maintain a relatively small energy spread after compression 
and  acceleration,  both  a  smooth  drive-laser  profile  and  a  low  microbunching  gain  are 
necessary.  Huang  et  al  [20]  discussed  in  detail  the  suppression  of  the  microbunching 
instability in the LCLS, where a laser heater [19] was adapted to provide strong Landau 
damping against the instability without degrading the SASE performance. For the LCLS 
at 1.5 Å, the tolerable rms energy spread at the undulator entrance is 1×10-4 at 14 GeV, 
. By using the laser heater to increase the rms energy 
which is about 0.2ρ as

spread from 3 to 40 keV in the LCLS injector, after a total compression factor of about 
-4 [20]. 
30, the slice rms energy spread at the undulator entrance can be controlled to 1×10
However, considering the gain enhancement of the optical klystron (see Fig. 1), a smaller 
energy spread (e.g., 5×10-5 or 0.1ρ) is desirable. This may be achievable by dropping the 
heater-induced  energy  spread  to  20  keV  at  the  expense  of  the  increased  microbunching 
instability gain. Figure 2 shows the expected microbunching gain with respect to a small 
initial density modulation at the injector end for the1-nC nominal LCLS bunch at these 
energy  spread  levels.  The  instability  tolerance  to  this  smaller  energy  spread  depends 
significantly  on  the  smoothness  of  the  drive-laser  profile  and  may  be  tested 
experimentally  in  the  LCLS.  A  smooth  Gaussian  drive-laser  profile  may  be  more 
desirable in this case than a flattop profile with many intensity ripples. Recently, a low-
charge  LCLS  option  is  proposed  to  mitigate  collective  effects  while  maintain  a  similar 
FEL  performance  [22].  The  microbunching  instability  gain  under  this  low-charge 

configuration is much smaller even at the reduced energy spread controlled by the laser 
heater. 
 
Another source of the energy spread, the energy diffusion due to spontaneous radiation 
along  the  undulator,  was  discussed  by  Saldin  et  al  [23].  For  a  planar  undulator,  the 
energy diffusion is given by:

3K .  Thus,  a  simultaneous 

reduction  in  beam  energy  and  undulator  parameter  can  significantly  reduce  this  effect.  
For the LCLS at λr = 1.5 Å and K=3.5, the rms energy spread increases from initial value 
of  5×10-5 to 1×10-4 at the undulator position of 40 m due to the spontaneous radiation. 
We note that this effect is not included in the LCLS simulations presented in Ref. [9], but 
is included in all our FEL simulations to be discussed below.  
 
B. LCLS simulation studies 
 
We use GENESIS 1.3 [24] to perform the 3D simulations of the LCLS optical klystrons 
as well as a compact x-ray FEL (see Sec. III C). The main parameters used in simulations 
are  listed  in  Table  1.  According  to  the  LCLS  undulator  configuration,  there  is  a  long 
break of about 1 meter between every third undulator section, where chicane structures 
can  be  installed  without  changing  the  present  undulator  placement.  We  place  four  4-
dipole chicanes in the first four long breaks between undulator sections (at 12, 24, 36, and 
48 m) to form a distributed optical klystron configuration. For each chicane, the optimal 
gain  enhancement  is  obtained  by  scanning  the  chicane  dipole  magnetic  field  strength. 
Two initial rms energy spread values of 1×10-5 and 5×10-5 at the entrance of the undulator 
are used in the 3D simulations. While we consider the energy spread of 5×10-5 may be 
achievable in the LCLS with a smooth drive-laser profile or with the low-charge option, 
the  energy  spread  of  1×10-5  requires  to  switch  off  the  laser  heater  completely  and  is 
probably not allowed by the microbunching instability in the linac. It is still included in 
the simulations in order to study the best possible optical klystron performance and the 
influence  of  spontaneous  energy  diffusion  in  the  undulator.  We  also  note  that  an  initial 
rms energy spread of 1×10-4 does not yield significant FEL improvement (or degradation) 
in  our  optical  klystron  configuration.  In  the  case  without  any  optical  klystron,  the 

simulation  results  show  little  difference  between  initial  energy  spread  of  5×10-5  and 
1×10-5.

Figure  3  shows  the  FEL  power  gain  along  the  undulator  with  and  without  optical 
klystrons  at  the  resonant  wavelength  of  1.5  Å  for  K  =  3.5  (the  current  LCLS  design 
parameters). The saturation length is shortened by 13 m using these optical klystrons with 
an initial energy spread of 5×10-5 and R56 of the chicanes at around 0.25 μm (with a small 
variation for each chicane). We also note that a 10% variation of the chicane R56 values 
does not make a visible difference for the FEL output power. 
 
To allow for the LCLS to reach 1.0 Å without increasing the beam energy, the undulator 
gap  may  be  increased  by  2  mm  to  reduce  the  undulator  parameter  to  K  =  2.7.  The  3D 
simulation  results  are  presented  in  figure  4.  Without  any  optical  klystron,  the  nominal 
LCLS beam cannot reach SASE saturation at this wavelength. With the addition of four 
optical klystrons as described here, the saturation distance is shortened by about 26 m and 
is well within the LCLS total undulator length. At this K value and using a lower beam 
energy (11.0 GeV), simulations of Fig. 5 also show the FEL saturation at 1.5 Å. In this 
case approximately 25 m of saturation length can be saved as compared to that without 
any  optical  klystron.  It  is  clear  from  these  numerical  examples  that  a  simultaneous 
reduction in beam energy and undulator parameter for the same radiation wavelength is 
beneficial  for  the  optical  klystron  enhancement,  where  the  energy  diffusion  due  to 
spontaneous radiation in the undulator is much reduced. 
 
Based  on  the  LCLS  parameters,  the  phase  matching  issue  is  also  studied  in  3D 
simulations in order to verify the 1D results discussed in section II. In GENESIS 1.3, the 

alignment  of  the  radiation  field  and  the  electron  beam  can  be  controlled  by  input 
parameters. We choose the second optical klystron arrangement with 1.5-Å FEL (K = 3.5, 
initial rms energy spread of 1×10-5) to study the FEL power fluctuations by introducing 
an additional phase shift in the simulations based on a particular R56. Figure 6 shows the 
influence of the additional phase shifts on power. In the seeded mode, with the optimal 
R56  of  0.3  μm,  we  observe  large  oscillations  when  this  phase  shift  varies  from  0  to  4π 
(corresponding to variation of R56 from 0.3 μm to 0.3006 μm). For the SASE mode, there 
are very small fluctuations with these additional phase shifts at the optimal R56 value of 
0.3 μm. When we reduce R56 to a smaller value of 0.1 μm, the power gain is reduced and 
the fluctuations get bigger. These 3D simulation results are in accordance with that from 
our 1D analysis. 
 
Another advantage of the optical klystron scheme is to relax the electron beam emittance 
requirement. We study this case with the LCLS design wavelength of 1.5 Å, with a peak 
current of 3.4 kA and a normalized rms emittance of 1.2 μm. If the normalized emittance 
is  relaxed  to  1.5  μm,  and  four  optical  klystrons  are  used  to  enhance  the  bunching,  the 
saturation length is almost the same as the case without any optical klystron but with a 
smaller  normalized  emittance  at  1.2  μm,  as  shown  in  figure  7.  We  also  note  that  the 
LCLS beam with a normalized emittance of 1.5 μm without any optical klystron will not 
produce  saturation  within  the  present  undulator  length.  Thus,  the  optical  klystron 
configuration relaxes the emittance requirement by more than 20%.  
 
C. A compact x-ray FEL  
 
We  have  seen  from  the  previous  discussions  that  lower  electron  energy  and  smaller 
undulator  parameter  are  beneficial  for  reducing  the  energy  diffusion  from  spontaneous 
radiation  along  the  undulator.  Inspired  by  the  Spring-8  Compact  SASE  Source  (SCSS) 
design  [3],  we  study  the  possibility  of  using  a  relatively  low  energy  electron  beam 
together with a short-period undulator to drive a compact x-ray FEL with the aid of the 
distributed optical klystrons. As shown in Table 1, a 1.5-cm period in-vacuum undulator 
with K = 1.3 is used according to the design parameters in SCSS. To produce 1.5-Å FEL 
radiation,  the  necessary  electron  energy  is  about  5  GeV.  Rather  than  a  standard  peak 
current of 3 kA as described in Ref [3], we assume a lower peak current of 2 kA and an 
rms  energy  spread  of  100  keV  (or  2×10-5)  at  the  undulator  entrance.  A  smaller  peak 
current allows for a smaller energy spread and may also help reduce the microbunching 
instability  gain  in  the  accelerator,  as  well  as  any  wakefield  effect  in  the  small  gap,  in-
vacuum undulator. Figure 8 shows the simulation results for the SASE mode without any 
optical klystron (for both 3-kA and 2-kA bunches) and with four optical klystrons (for a 

2-kA bunch). The latter saturates at around 50 m of the undulator distance, which is still 
about 10 m shorter than the higher-current case without any optical klystron. 
 
VI Summary 
 
The small, experimentally measured uncorrelated energy spread from rf guns offers the 
opportunity  to  consider  applications  of  optical  klystrons  in  x-ray  FELs.  In  contrast  to  a 
seeded FEL, our paper shows that the optical klystron gain is not sensitive to the relative 
phase between the SASE radiation and the electron beam, and that the radiation power is 
very stable with a relatively large tuning range of optical klystrons. 3D simulations of the 
LCLS  with  a  distributed  optical  klystron  configuration  show  significant  gain 
enhancement  if  the  slice  energy  spread  at  the  undulator  entrance  can  be  controlled  to  a 
very small level. The improved performance can be used to obtain the FEL saturation at 
shorter  x-ray  wavelengths  for  a  fixed  undulator  length  or  to  relax  the  stringent 
requirement  on  the  beam  emittance.  The  exploration  of  optical  klystrons  in  a  very 
compact x-ray FEL also indicates promising results. Therefore, we think that the optical 
klystron  configuration  can  be  an  easy  “add-on”  to  SASE  x-ray  FELs  provided  that 
electron beams with very small energy spreads are obtainable at the final beam energy.

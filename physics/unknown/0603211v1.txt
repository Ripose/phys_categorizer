Abstract 

We  compare  and  synthesize  the  results  of  two  microrheological  experiments  on  the 

cytoskeleton of single cells. In the first one, the creep function J(t) of a cell stretched between 

two  glass  plates  is  measured  after  applying  a  constant  force  step.  In  the  second  one,  a 

micrometric  bead  specifically  bound  to  transmembrane  receptors  is  driven  by  an  oscillating 

optical  trap,  and  the  viscoelastic  coefficient  Ge(ω)  is  retrieved.  Both  J(t)  and  Ge(ω)  exhibit 

power  law  behavior:

and

,  with  the  same  exponent  α  ≈  0.2. 

This  power  law  behavior  is  very  robust  ; α  is  distributed  over  a  narrow  range,  and  shows 

almost no dependance on the cell type, on the nature of the protein complex which transmits 

the mechanical stress, nor on the typical length scale of the experiment. On the contrary, the 

prefactors A0 and G0 appear very sensitive to these parameters. Whereas the exponents α are 

normally  distributed  over  the  cell  population,  the  prefactors A0  and  G0    follow  a  log-normal 

repartition.  These  results  are  compared  with  other  data  published  in  the  litterature.  We 

propose a global interpretation, based on a semi-phenomenological model, which involves a 

broad  distribution  of  relaxation  times  in  the  system.  The  model  predicts  the  power  law 

behavior  and  the  statistical  repartition  of  the  mechanical  parameters,  as  experimentally 

observed  for  the  cells.  Moreover,  it  leads  to  an  estimate  of  the  largest  response  time  in  the 

cytoskeletal network:τm ~ 1000 s.

I - Introduction 

To perform their functions, living cells must adapt to external stresses and to varying 

mechanical  properties  of  their  environment.  Thus,  rheological  properties  (i.e.  stress-strain 

relationships) are key features of living cells. Actually, mechanics play a major role in many 

biological  processes  such  as  cell  crawling,  wound  healing,  protein  regulation  and  even 

apoptosis (Janmey, 1998). Conversely, several pathologies, like metastasis, asthma or sickle 

cell  anemia,  involve  alteration  of  the  mechanical  properties  of  a  given  cell  type.  All  these 

processes are mainly controlled by the structure and mechanical properties of the cytoskeletal 

network. This network is a dynamical assembly of macromolecules, principally made of actin 

filaments,  intermediate  filaments  and  microtubules,  and  interacting  with  a  variety  of 

associated  proteins,  crosslinkers,  and  molecular  motors.  The  mechanical  properties  of  the 

cytoskeletal network are therefore the subject of many experimental studies.  

These studies have been made possible by the development of numerous quantitative 

micromanipulation techniques, such as micropipettes (Sato et al. 1990), cell poking (Petersen 

et  al.  1982),  shear  flow  cytometry  (Dewey  et  al.  1981,  Barbee  et  al.  1994),  atomic  force 

microscopy  (AFM)  (Rotsch  et  al.  1997,  Sato  et  al.  2000,  Alcaraz  et  al.  2003),  microplates 

(Thoumine and Ott 1997, Caille et al. 2002, Desprat et al. 2005), optical tweezers (Laurent et 

al.  2002,  Balland  et  al.  2005,  Yanai  et  al.  2005),  optical  stretchers  (Guck  et  al.  2001, 

Wottawah  et  al.  2005),  magnetic  tweezers  (Bausch  et  al.  1999,  Wilhelm  et  al.  2003), 

magnetic  twisters  (Fabry  et  al.  2001,  Laurent  et  al.  2002),  particle  tracking  (Yamada  et  al. 

2000, Tseng et al. 2002, Lau et al. 2003). These techniques are complementary, in the sense 

that  they  probe  the  behavior  of  the  intracellular  medium  at  different  length  scales  and  time 

scales, and that they implement stresses and strains in different geometries and with different 

orders of magnitude. 

Most  recent  results  in  microrheology  of  the  intracellular  medium  have  demonstrated 

that it is a complex viscoelastic medium which cannot be simply modelized by associating a 

finite,  small  number  of  elastic  and  viscous  elements.  Indeed,  the  viscoelastic  complex 

modulus of the cell medium exhibits a power law behavior on a wide frequency range (Fabry 

et  al.  2003,  Balland  et  al.  2005).  Similarly  the  creep  function  behaves  as  a  power  law  of 

elapsed time (Lenormand et al. 2004, Desprat et al. 2005). This clearly indicates that there is 

a  broad  and  dense  distribution  of  dissipation  times  in  the  cell,  and  that  the  mechanisms 

responsible for the storage of elastic energy and its dissipation are strongly correlated. Such 

behavior, characteristic of structural damping, is found in other complex viscoelastic systems, 

like  colloids,  gels,  pastes,  and  more  generally  the  class  of  so-called  "soft  glassy  materials".

However,  a  detailed  interpretation  of  the  origin  of  structural  damping  behavior  in  the 

cytoskeletal network has still to be built.  

One of the objectives of this paper is to propose a global description of the mechanics 

of  the  cytoskeletal  network,  consistent  with  the  whole  set  of  data  gathered  from  numerous 

experiments  performed  up  to  now.  It  aims  at  contributing  to  answer  several  questions,  such 

as:  how  might  one  compare  the  results  of  experiments  performed  with  different 

microrheological  techniques  and/or  in  various  experimental  conditions  ?  Is  there  a  unified 

behavior at the nano- and micro-scale level and at the scale of the whole cell ? How does this 

behavior depend on the cell type, and on the nature of the receptor through which the stress is 

applied  ?    Is  it  possible  to  build  a  phenomenological  model  which  predicts  the  power  law 

response functions and also the peculiar dispersion of results obtained from a set of cells of 

the same type ? 

The paper is organized as follows: section II presents the experimental protocols and 

the  two  techniques  used  here  to  measure  either  the  local  dynamical  response  of  the  actin 

network  to  an  oscillatory  force  (optical  tweezers)  or  the  creep  function  at  the  scale  of  the 

whole cell (uniaxial stretching). The results of the two experiments are reported in section III. 

The  power  laws  measured  for  the  viscoelastic  modulus  vs  frequency  and  for  the  creep 

function  vs  time  are  fully  consistent.  The  prefactor  G0  of  the  power  law,  i.e.  the  elastic 

modulus measured for the same cell type at the reference frequency f = 1Hz, follows a log-

normal distribution. A comparison between different cell types and receptors shows that the 

value of the exponent α in the power law is remarkably homogeneous: α ≈ 0.2. Section IV 

presents  a  review  of  other  data  collected  in  the  litterature.  The  common  features  emerging 

from  the  different  cell  types,  probed  by  different  techniques  and  in  various  experimental 

conditions  are  underlined.  The  possible  origins  for  some  discrepancies,  mainly  in  the 

prefactor of the power laws, are discussed. An original, semi-phenomenological model for the 

cell mechanical behavior is set out in section V. We assume that the cell is built of a random 

infinite series of elementary mechanical units, following on average a scaling law repartition. 

It  leads  to  correct  predictions  for  the  response  functions,  including  power  law  behaviors, 

normal  and  log-normal  distributions  respectively  for  the  exponent α  and  the  prefactor  G0. 

Section VI details the quantitative comparison with experimental data, leading to an estimate 

for the largest relaxation time in the cell τm.

- Cell culture 

II – Experimental setups and protocols 

We studied the microrheology of two primary cell cultures, mouse ear fibroblasts and  

rat  alveolar  macrophages,  and  four  different  cell  lines:  C2  and  C2-7  myogenic  cells,  A549 

human  alveolar  epithelial  cells,  Madin–Darby  Canine  Kidney  (MDCK)  kidney  epithelial 

cells, and mouse fibroblasts L929. 

The C2 myogenic cell line is derived from the skeletal muscle of adult CH3 mice. The C2-7 

cell line is a subclone of the C2 cell line. They were kindly provided by M. Lambert and R.M. 

Mège  (INSERM  U440,  Institut  du  Fer  à  Moulin,  Paris)  and  by  D.  Paulin  (Biologie 

Moléculaire de la Différentiation EA 300, Université Paris VII, Paris). A549 are human lung 

carcinoma  cells  (American  Type  Culture  Collection,  Rockville,  MD).  MDCK  cells  were 

kindly provided by Ph. Chavrier (Membrane and Cytoskeleton Dynamics, CNRS, Instit Curie, 

Paris).  Alveolar  macrophages  were  isolated  from  Sprague-Dawley  rats  by  broncho-alveolar 

lavages  and  re-suspended  in  RPMI  medium  supplemented  with  0.1%  BSA  [Féréol  et  al. 

2006].  Other  cells  were  grown  at  37°C  in  a  humidified  5%  CO2  -  95%  air  atmosphere,  in 

Dulbecco's  Modified  Essential  Medium  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  calf  serum,  2  mM 

glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin. 

For creep experiments, the cells were detached from culture flasks (1% trypsin and 1 

mM EDTA), centrifugated at 900 rpm for 3 min, diluted in DMEM supplemented with 15mM 

HEPES, and maintained under smooth agitation for 2 h at 37°C.  

For optical tweezers experiments, the cells were detached from culture flasks 24 hours 
before  experiments  and  plated  at  a  density  of  about  300  cells/mm2,  in  complete  culture 

medium  with  serum,  on  glass  coverslips  (22 mm × 22 mm)  coated  with  fibronectin.  For 

optical tweezers experiments on A549 via ICAM-1, 10 ng/ml of recombinant human Tumor 

Necrosis Factor-α was added to this medium to induce the expression of ICAM-1. 

- Microplates preparation 

Glass  microplates  were  cleaned  for  10  min  in  a  Piranha  mixture  -  2/3  pure  sulfuric 

acid, 1/3 hydrogen peroxide 30% and rinsed in water. 

For non-specific binding, microplates were dipped in a bath of 90% ethanol, 8% water, 

2%  3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane  for  2  h,  rinsed  in  ethanol,  and  finally  incubated  in  98% 

water, 2% glutaraldehyde 1 h before the experiment. 

For specific binding to integrins, microplates were dipped in a bath of 5mL  DMEM 

contenant and 25 µL fibronectine F-1141 (Sigma) 2 h before the experiment.

24/03/2006 

For specific binding to cadherins, microplates were directly coated in the experimental 

chamber  to  avoid  drying  of  the  proteins.  The  microplates  tips,  previously  coated  with 

organopolysiloxane (Sigmacote, Sigma) [Gavard et al., 2003], were first dipped, for 2 h, in a 

150  µL  drop  of  borate  buffer  containing  2  µL  of  a  2  µg/µL  Fcγ  antibody  solution  (Jackson 

ImmunoResearch, West  Grove, PA)  [Lambert et al, 2000]. After rinsing with borate buffer, 

microplates  were  dipped  for  2  h  in  a  200  µL  borate  buffer  containing  25  µL  of  NCad-Fc 

“chimeric”  protein [Lambert, 2000]. Then the plates tips were rinsed and finally dipped in a 2 

mL borate buffer containing  10 mg/mL BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, France), to ensure saturation of 

residual non-specific adhesion sites. 

 

- Bead coatings 

For a specific binding to integrins, carboxylated silica microbeads (3.47 µm diameter, 

Bangs Laboratories Inc., IN, USA) were coated with a polypeptide containing the arginine–

glycine–aspartic  (RGD)  sequence  (PepTite-2000,  Telios  pharmaceuticals,  CA,  USA), 

according to the manufacturer's procedure.  

For specific binding to ICAM-1 (CD54), the same silica beads were first coated with 

goat  anti-mouse  IgG  (BD  Biosciences,  5µg  of  monoclonal  antibody  for  100µg  of  beads,  in 

PBS for 30 min at 4°C under  gentle agitation), and secondly with mouse anti-human CD54 

(BD Biosciences, same protocol). 

- Measurements of the creep function J(t) 

The  creep  function  of  a  single  living  cell  is  measured  by  means  of  a  home-made 

stretching  rheometer,  which  has  been  described  in  detail  elsewhere  (Desprat  et  al.  2005, 

Desprat et al. submitted). This setup takes advantage of a simple uniaxial geometry, since the 

cell is stretched between two glass microplates, a rigid one and a flexible one (Thoumine and 

Ott,  1997).  The  two  arms  bearing  the  microplates  are  set  up  on  each  side  of  the  inverted 

microscope, perpendicularly to the optical axis. A XYZ piezoelectric stage, interfaced with a 

computer, allows to accurately control the gap between the plates. The stiffness of the flexible 

plate is independantly calibrated, therefore it is possible to simultaneously measure the force 

applied to the cell, and its deformation. A real time detection and an efficient feedback loop 

were  implemented,  in  order  to  monitor  and  control  the  flexible  plate  deflection.  Thus  the 

setup  can  be  used  as  a  constant  stress  micro-rheometer.  The  whole  setup  is  isolated  from 

vibrations and is maintained at 37 ± 0.2 °C.

Each cell stretched in the gap between the microplates is visualized under bright light 

illumination and its image is recorded with a digital CCD camera, as shown for instance on 

Figure 1. The position of the tip of the thin flexible plate is held constant to ensure that the 

plate deflection and therefore the applied force remain constant. The strain ε(t) is defined as 

(L(t)-L0)/L0, where L(t) represents the cell length at time t and L0 = L(0) its initial length when 

the  force  step  is  applied.  The  applied  stress σ0  is  taken  as  the  ratio  between  the  constant 

applied force F0 and an effective area A of the cell section. An estimate of this effective area 

is  given  by  the  mean  value  of  the  measured  contact  areas  of  the  cell  at  each  microplate, 

assumed to be circular. For each cell, the creep function J(t) is derived from:  

 

  

 

 

J(t) = ε(t)/σ0

- Measurement of the complex viscoelastic modulus Ge(ω). 

An  optical  tweezers  setup  is  used  to  measure  the  viscoelastic  modulus  of  the 

cytoskeletal  network,  by  applying  an  oscillating  force  to  a  microbead  specifically  bound  to 

transmembrane receptors (see cell culture and coating). The setup and force calibration have 

been  previously  described  (Lenormand  et  al.  2001,  Balland  et  al.  2005).  The  experimental 

chamber is mounted on a piezoelectric stage and is submitted to a sinusoïdal displacement at 

frequency f=ω/2π, while the trap is kept at a fixed position (Figure 2). The displacements of 

the chamber xc(t) and of the bead xb(t) are recorded with a fast (500 Hz) CCD camera. At any 

time,  the  force  F(t)  = 

exp(jω t)  exerted  on  the  bead  is  calculated  from  the  bead-trap 

(Fˆ ω
)

distance x

b according to the calibration curves, while the cellular deformation is related to the 

relative displacement x(t) = xc(t) – xb(t) =

)

Here

(Fˆ ω and
)

(xˆ ω are  complex  numbers,  with  a  relative  non-zero  phase.  Using  Labview®, 

)

we generate a sequence of successive sinusoidal signals at given frequencies (from 0.05 to 50 

Hz),  which  control  the  piezoelectric  ceramic  motion  xc(t),  and  a  synchronous  sequence  of 

pulses  to  trigger  the  image  acquisition.  The  total  duration  of  a  measurement  on  the  same 

single cell never exceeds 2.5 minutes, in order to prevent a possible actin remodelling at the 

bead periphery on a large time scale, or a slow drift of the bead on the cell surface,.

Here  the  cell  is  considered  as  an  elastic  homogeneous  medium.  The  dimensionless 

factor f(Θ), for which we calculated an analytic expression (formula B3) (Laurent et al. 2002), 

accounts for the actual immersion of the bead into the cell. The parameter Θ , defined as half 

the angle of the immersion cone of the bead into the medium (Figure 3), is directly measured 

from image recordings.  

III - Measurements of the viscoelastic parameters for different cell types.  

- Creep function and viscoelastic modulus of premuscular C2 cells  

A typical recording of the creep function J(t), obtained for a single C2 cell with the stretching 

rheometer, is shown in figure 4. Over three orders of magnitude in time (0.1 < t <100 s), J(t) 

is remarkably well fitted by a power law 

α)

 , with α = 0.25 and A0 = 0.017 Pa-1. 

tA)t(J =
(
0 t
0

We stress on the fact that t0 is not a parameter of the fit, but an arbitrary reference time, for 

which  J(t)  takes  the  value  A0.  The  dimension  of  A0  is  therefore  the  same  as  J.  For  all  the 

measurements, we chose for convenience t0 = 1s. As already shown in (Desprat et al. 2005), 

any attempt to adjust J(t) by a sum of a few exponential functions in the full time range leads 

to a much poorer agreement. There is an exact equivalence between a power law behavior of 

J(t)  as  a  function  of  time  t,  and  a  power  law  behavior  of  the  complex  viscoelastic  modulus 

Ge(ω) as a function of the frequency ω (equations (A5-A7) in appendix A). Consequently, the 

value of |Ge(ω)| derived from this experiment may be expressed as:

From figure 4, on can calculate a typical value G0 = |Ge(ω0)| = 103 Pa for this particular curve 

at the chosen reference frequency ω0/2π =1/ t0 = 1Hz.  

A remarkable feature is that all the tested cells belonging to the same C2 population 

exhibit  a  similar  power  law  behavior.  Figures  5a  and  5b  show  respectively  the  measured 

distributions of the exponent α and of the logarithm ln(G0) from a set of 43 different C2 cells, 

glued to the glass plate through a glutaraldehyde coating. On the same figures 5a and 5b are 

also  plotted  the  cumulative  distributions  of α  and  ln(G0).  The  cumulative  distributions  are 

well adjusted by an error function:

One  notices  that  the  distribution  of  exponents  α  closely  follows  a  normal  law,  while  the 

distribution  of  prefactors  G0    appears  log-normal.  From  the  erf  fits  one  retrieves  the  best 

estimates of the average exponent of the power law <α> = 0.242, of the standard deviation σα 

= 0.082, and of the standard error Δα = 0.013 (see table 1). Similarly, for ln(G0), the estimated 

averaged value is <ln(G0)> = 6.46, the standard deviation is σG = 0.82, and the standard error 

is  ΔG  =  0.12.  Accordingly,  for  |Ge(ω)|  at  1Hz,  one  infers  the  median  value  G0M  = 

exp(<ln(G0)>)  =  640  (+80/-70)  Pa.  Notice  that  the  mean  value  <G0>  =    1060  ±  190  Pa  is 

higher than G0M, which is consistent with a log-normal, non symmetric distribution of G0.   

 

A  parallel  analysis  was  performed  on  the  same  C2  cell  type  studied  with  the  optical 

tweezers setup. In this case, by applying a sequence of oscillating stresses to a single cell at 

different  frequencies,  one  directly  measures  the  complex  viscoelastic  coefficient  Ge(ω)  as  a 

function of ω. In the experiments described below, all the beads are RGD coated and bind to 

the  cells  through  integrins.  In  figure  6  the  measured  values  of  the  modulus  |Ge|  and  of  the 

phase δ  of Ge(ω) are shown for a single C2 cell, as a function of the frequency f=ω/2π, in the 

range 0.05-50 Hz. As in the cell stretching experiment, |Ge| behaves as a power law of f over 

three frequency decades. For this particular cell, the exponent α is found equal to 0.30, and 

the value G0 of |Ge| at 1Hz is found equal to 155 Pa. Moreover, the measured phase shift δ 

remains  constant,  within  a  good  approximation,  in  the  studied  frequency  range.  Its  average 

value is equal to 0.45, very close to the theoretically expected value απ/2 = 0.47 (see formula 

A7 in appendix A). 

For a whole set of C2 cells tested with optical tweezers, Ge(ω) present similar power 

law behaviors. Figure 7a and 7b show the distributions of the exponent α and of the logarithm 

ln(G0)  of  |Ge|  at  1Hz,  measured  for  22  different  C2  cells,  together  with  the  cumulative 

distributions of α and ln(G0). As in figures 5a and 5b, the α distribution follows a normal law, 

while the distribution of G0 appears log-normal. We have obtained the best estimates: <α> = 

0.208 ± 0.021, G0M = 310 (+130/-100) Pa (median  value)  and  <G0> = 570 ±  150  Pa  (mean 

value).   

It  is  remarkable  that  the  two  experiments  (uniform  stretching  and  local  oscillating 

force),  performed  in  quite  different  conditions,  lead  to  the  same  power  law  behavior,  with 

approximately the same exponent α ≈ 0.22 (within experimental error). However, one notices 

that the prefactor G0 differs in the two cases. Several possible origins of this difference will be 

discussed in section IV.

- Viscoelastic modulus of cells excited through different receptors. 

With the optical tweezers setup, we have also performed oscillating force experiments 

with  alveolar  epithelial  cells  (A549).  Here  we  compared  the  results  obtained  by  using  two 

different mechanical receptors on which the stress is applied: integrins and ICAM-1. ICAM 

(InterCellular Adhesion Molecules) are transmembrane proteins which allow for instance the 

macrophages  to  adhere  and  to  migrate  over  the  pulmonary  epithelium  (Marlin  and  Springer 

1987). The beads are either coated with RGD peptide or anti-ICAM-1 ligands. Except for the 

nature  of  the  receptor,  the  experimental  protocols  are  identical  in  the  two  cases.  For  each 

single cell, the observed behavior of the elastic modulus Ge(ω) is very similar in both series of 

experiments. It is also similar to the one described above for C2 cells: |Ge(ω)| behaves as a 

power  law  of  the  excitation  frequency,  while  the  phase δ  remains  approximately  constant. 

The exponent α of the power law is close to 0.2 in both cases. The results are summarized in 

table 1 and in figures 8 and 9. Over two sets of cells (N=23 and 19 respectively), one observes 

normal distributions for the exponent α : <α> = 0.219 ± 0.014 for RGD coating, and <α> = 

0.181  ±  0.014  for  anti-ICAM-1  coating.  The  prefactor  G0  at  f=1Hz  follows  a  log-normal 

distribution, with median values G0M = 420 (+80/-70) Pa (RGD coating) and G0M = 80 (+25/-

20) Pa (anti-ICAM-1 coating). While the mean values <α> of the exponent appear very close 

to each other for both coatings, the median value G0M  is found appreciably lower when the 

stress is applied through ICAM-1 than when it is applied through integrins.  

 

 

Using the uniaxial rheometer we also compared the creep functions of C2 myoblasts 

stretched: i) through non-specific mechanical receptors (plates coated with glutaraldehyde that 

binds any protein of the cell surface - data already detailed in the previous section), ii) through 

cadherins,  the  specific  proteins  of  cell-cell  adhesion.  In  both  cases,  the  creep  function  is  a 

week  power  law  of  the  time.  The  two  sets  of  cells  (Nglu=43  and  Ncad=13)  shows  normal 

distributions for the exponent α , with <αglu> = 0.242 ± 0.013  and <αcad> = 0.29 ± 0.02. The 

prefactor G0 at f=1Hz follows a log-normal distribution, with median values G0M = 640 (+80/-

70) Pa (glutaraldehyde) and G0M = 850 (+75/-65) Pa (cadherin). Unlike the Integrin/ICAM-1 

comparison  in  the  previous  paragraph,  here  the  median  values  G0M    are  very  close  to  each 

other  for  both  coatings,  while  the  mean  value  <α>  of  the  exponent  is  found  appreciably 

higher when the stress is applied through cadherins than through glutaraldehyde. However, in 

both  Integrin/ICAM-1  and  Cadherin/Glutaraldehyde  comparisons,  an  increase  of  <α>  is 

related  to  an  increase  of  G0M.  Such  a    correlation  between  <α>  and  G0M    values  can  be 

 

10

understood by considering molecular motor activity for instance (Balland et al., 2005) and is 

correctly taken into account by the mechanical model presented in section V.

- Other cell types.  

 

As  reported  in  table  1,  we  have  performed  microrheological  experiments  on  several 

other  cell  types,  using  either  uniaxial  stretching  or  optical  tweezers,  and  in  various  coating 

conditions. The individual cell behavior appears strikingly independant of the cell type and of 

the  experimental  conditions.  When  stretching  the  whole  cell,  the  creep  function  J(t)  is 

accurately  adjusted  by  a  power  law  function  of  time  t.  Similarly,  in  oscillating  force 

experiments,  the  viscoelastic  modulus  Ge(ω)  behaves  as  a  power  law  of  the  excitation 

frequency. As seen in table 1, the average exponent <α> of the power law always remains in 

the range 0.15-0.25, whatever the cell type and function: this holds for premuscular cells (C2 

myoblasts), epithelial cells (alveolar A549 and MDCK) , fibroblasts (primary and L929), and 

macrophages (primary). Although the number of cell tested may not always be high enough to 

yield an accurate statistic, the prefactor G0 of the complex modulus at 1Hz seems to follow a 

log-normal  distribution.  Contrary  to  what  is  observed  for  the  exponent α,  the  median  value 

G0M  of  G0  appears  to  depend  on  the  cell  type  and  on  the  experimental  conditions  (see 

discussion in following section).  

 

 

 

IV - Comparison with other experimental results  

The  most  prominent  feature  emerging  from  the  experiments  is  the  robustness  of  the 

power law behavior, independent of cells types and experimental conditions, as summarized 

in Table 1. The average values <α> of the exponent remain very close to 0.2. This result is 

independant of the biological of the cell, of the length scale of the experiment, of the nature of 

the  complex  transmitting  the  stress.  Other  experiments  performed  on  other  cell  types,  and 

with different techniques, confirm such universal features of the cell mechanical behavior.  

 

- Optical Magnetic Twisting Cytometry experiments 

First,  Fabry  and  coworkers  (Fabry  et  al.  2001)  have  performed  optical  magnetic 

twisting cytometry (OMTC) on human airway smooth muscle cells (HASM). The experiment 

consists in applying an oscillatory torque to a magnetic bead bound to the cell membrane, and 

optically tracking its displacement. They have shown that the viscoelastic modulus Gs follows 
a power law of the driving frequency, in the range 10-2 – 100 Hz. They measured an exponent 

<α>  =  0.204  ±  0.002  in  control  conditions,  at  a  temperature  T  =  37°C.  This  exponent  only 

varies when the cells are treated with stiffening or depolymerizing agents of the cytoskeleton. 

11

24/03/2006 

Still in control conditions, and assuming that the magnetic beads are, on average, embedded 

by 10% into the cell (<Θ > ≈ 37°), they compute a median value of Gs at 1Hz approximately 

equal  to  2000  Pa  (Mijailovitch  et  al.  2002).  However  their  definition  of  the  viscoelastic 

coefficient Gs, which reduces to a static shear modulus µ at low frequency, is different from 

ours,  Ge,  which  is  defined  from  the  Young  modulus  E.  Assuming  that  the  cell  medium  is 

incompressible  (E/µ  =  3),  this  leads  to  G0M  ≈  6000  Pa  for  HASM  cells.  Lenormand  et  al. 

(Lenormand et al. 2004) have adapted the OMTC technique, and measured the creep function 

Jc(t) on the same HASM cell type as Fabry and coworkers, by applying a constant step torque 
on a magnetic bead bound to the cell. As expected, they found that Jc(t) is proportional to tα, 

with <α> = 0.209 ± 0.003. Converted into elastic coefficient, the prefactor has the same order 

of magnitude as in the oscillatory experiment.  

 

For  other  cell  types  studied  by  OMTC  (Fabry  et  al.  2003),  power  laws  were  again 

observed,  with  quite  identical  exponents:  <α>  =  0.195  ±  0.005  for  mouse  embryonic 

carcinoma cells (F9), <α> = 0.173 ± 0.005 for human bronchial epithelial cells, <α> = 0.200 

±  0.009  for  mouse  macrophages  (J744.A)  and  <α>  =  0.186  ±  0.008  for  human  neutrophils. 

The associated prefactors G0M at 1Hz could not be easily retrieved, since they depend on the 

exact angle of immersion θ of the bead into the cells, which is not reported. Assuming that the 

height  of  immersion  is  comprised  between  10%  and  30%  of  the  bead  diameter  (37°  <Θ  < 

66°), and following the simulations of Mijailovitch (Mijailovitch et al. 2002), G0M falls in the 

range  130-900  Pa  (F9),  1000-8000  Pa  (HBE),  1500-10000  Pa  (J744.A),  and  500-3600  Pa 

(neutrophils).  

 

- Atomic Force Microscopy experiments 

By  probing  cells  with  the  oscillating  tip  of  an  Atomic  Force  Microscope  (AFM), 

Alcaraz  et  al.  (Alcaraz  et  al.  2003)  were  also  able  to  measure  the  frequency  dependant 

viscoelastic  modulus  Gs(ω)=G'(ω)+G"(ω)  for  epithelial  alveolar  cells  (A549),  in  the  range 

0.1 – 100 Hz, at room temperature (T ≈ 20°C). Consistently with the present work and Fabry's 

work,  they  observe  that  both  G'  and  G"  are  proportional  to  ωα , with  <α> =  0.22.  The 

corresponding mean value of G0 = Ge(ω)=3Gs(ω) at 1Hz is <G0> ≈ 2200 Pa. Probing the same 

cell  type  (A549)  by  MTC,  in  the  same  frequency  range,  Trepat  et  al.  (Trepat  et  al.  2005) 

found power laws with an exponent <α> = 0.214 and a median value of the prefactor G0: G0M 

≈ 2000 Pa (this value is highly dependant on the bead immersion, here taken equal to 30% on 

average). Notice that we have measured the same exponent <α> in our experiments on A549 

 

12

24/03/2006 

cells (table 1). However the values of G0M (or <G0>) are about 3-5 folds higher in AFM and 

MTC  than  the  values  measured  by  optical  tweezers  and  stretching  rheometer  (see  table  1). 

Possible origins of these disagreements are discussed below. 

The same AFM technique was applied to human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) 

(Alcaraz et al. 2003), which should not noticeably differ from the HBE cells probed by Fabry 

et  al.  Their  results  are  very  similar,  leading  to  <α> =  0.20  and  <G0>  =  2400  Pa. 

Independantly, Puig-de-Morales et al. probed the same BEAS-2B cell with MTC, at T = 37°C 

(Puig-de-Morales et al. 2001). They retrieved values of <α> = 0.27 and of <G0> about one 

order of magnitude lower than in (Trepat et al. 2005).  

- Active and passive microrheology on embedded probes 

It  is  of  great  interest  to  mention  the  results  of  some  passive  microrheology 

experiments, consisting in measuring the viscoelastic coefficients of the intracellular medium 

by following the motion of submicrometric particles embedded in the cytoplasm. Yamada and 

coworkers  (Yamada  et  al.  2000)  measured  the  mean  square  displacement  <Δr2(t)>,  as  a 

function  of  time,  of  spherical  endogenous  granules  present  in  kidney  epithelial  cells  COS7, 

from which they infered the frequency dependant viscoelastic modulus Gs(ω). The motion of 

the granules is clearly subdiffusive, and, although the authors do not explicitely mention this 
interpretation, the variations of Gs(ω) are consistent with a power law |Gs(ω)| = G0sωα  in the 
range 1 < ω < 104 rad/s.  The exponent α is of the order of 0.5 in the perinuclear region, and 

0.33 in the lamellar region, where the density of actin is higher. The average value of |Ge(ω)| 

= 3|Gs(ω)| at 1 Hz (ω= 2π rad/s) is <G0> ≈ 70 Pa in the perinuclear region and <G0> ≈ 210 

Pa  in  the  lamellar  region.  In  a  similar  way,  Tseng  et  al.  (Tseng  et  al.  2002)  recorded  the 

motion of carboxylated microspheres microinjected in 3T3 fibroblasts. It is harder in this case 

to  characterize  their  subdiffusive  motion  by  a  single  exponent.  However,  the  measured 

average compliance of the cytoplasm at a time scale τ = 0.1s is in the range 0.01-0.03 Pa-1, 

which  leads  to  <G0>    around  100-300  Pa  at  1Hz.  More  recently,  Yanai  et  al.  (Yanai  et  al. 

2004) used optical tweezers to apply step forces on endogenous granules embedded in human 

neutrophils,  and  showed  that  the  response  is  well  represented  by  a  power  law  of  exponent 

about 0.5. Besides, Lau et al. (Lau et al., 2003) measured the two-point correlation function of 

the  mean-square  displacement  of  embedded  particles,  and  retrieved  an  exponent α  close  to 

0.25. Actually, a two-point microrheology experiment is expected to be more sensitive to the 

cytoskeletal deformations than one-point microrheology. This indicates at least that one must 

 

 

 

13

24/03/2006 

behavior: 

be cautious when comparing the results of experiments performed on embedded particles and 

on probes specifically bound to transmembrane receptors.  

In  an  attempt  to  synthesize  this  large  amount  of  experimental  works,  one  observes 

enough  common  properties  to  bring  out  some  general  features  in  the  cell  mechanical 

- the microrheological behavior of the cell is quite accurately described by power laws. 

This  holds  either  for  active  microrheology  (viscoelastic  modulus,  creep  function)  or  for 

passive  microrheology  (diffusion  of  particles).    This  clearly  states  that  the  cell  mechanics 

involves a broad distribution of response times.  

- except in particle tracking microrheology experiments, in which the probes  are  not 

directly attached to the cytoskeleton, the average exponent of the power law lies in a narrow 

range: 0.15 < α < 0.25. This result is independant of the experimental technique, of the probe 

lengthscale, of the cell type and of the nature of the complex transmitting the stress. Adding 

drugs which induce the stiffening (contactile agents like thrombin, histamin), or the softening 

(disrupting agents like cytochalasin D or latrunculin) [Fabry et al. 2003, Puig-de-Morales et 

al.  2004,  Trepat et  al.  2005]  of  the  cytoskeleton,  does  not  induce  a  dramatic  change  of  this 

exponent.  Only  the  inhibition  of  the  acto-myosin  activity  by  blebbistatin  may  cause  α  to 

lower down to about 0.10 [Balland et al. 2005]. The very robust feature of the cell response 

can only be explained by some common structural organization of the cytoskeletal network, 

independant of the length scale and of the biological cell function. In section V we propose to 

model this by a self similar assembly of elementary mechanical units.   

 

- within a set of cells of the same type, probed by the same technique, we observe that 

the  repartition  of  the  viscoelastic  modulus  G0  =  |Ge(ω)|  at  1  Hz  is  asymmetric  and  clearly 

follows a log-normal distribution. This distribution is characterized by its median value G0M = 

exp(<log(G0)>). Other authors also reported such log-normal repartitions (Fabry et al. 2003, 

Puig-de-Morales et al. 2004, Trepat et al. 2005). The model developped in section V provides 

an interpretation of this log-normal distribution.   

- from one cell type to another, but also within a same cell type from one experimental 

technique to another, measurements of G0M - or of <G0> for the authors who do not make the 
distinction between G0M and <G0> - present a wide dispersity (from about 102 to about 105 

Pa). A global and consistent interpretation of the origin of this dispersion appears much more 

difficult  to  elaborate.  Indeed,  several  competing  factors  can  be  invoked  to  explain  the 

observed differences, some of them being related to intrinsic biological mechanisms, others to 

experimental conditions or possible artifacts. We enumerate below some of them:  

 

14

24/03/2006 

i) The cell type, associated to a given function, is expected to have a relevant influence 

on the cell average stiffness. The density of actin in the cell, but also the structure of the actin 

network should indeed largely determine the cell rigidity. Moreover, the activity of molecular 

motors  and  their  spatial  distribution  are  known  to  contribute  to  the  cytoskeleton  dynamics, 

and thus to its mechanical behavior. Actually, it appears difficult to bring out from existing 

data  some  mechanical  characteristics  associated  to  a  given  cell  type.  All  the  more  as  other 

factors do also influence the cell stiffness. 

ii) In both OMTC and Optical Tweezers experiments, the determination of G0 is very 

sensitive to the precise knowledge of the bead immersion angle Θ .  This parameter is difficult 

to measure with a good accuracy from the images of single cells. Besides, taking an average 

value for <Θ> may lead to overestimate the contribution of weakly bound beads, and thus to 

underestimate <G0> (Laurent et al. 2002, Fabry et al. 1999). Moreover, G0 is not calculated 

in  the  same  manner  according  to  different  authors.  In  this  work,  Ge(ω)  is  derived  from 

formula (B5), where the analytical function f(Θ) accounts for the Θ dependance (formula B3). 

In  OMTC  experiments  (Fabry  et  al.  2001,  Fabry  et  al.  2003,  Puig-de-Morales  et  al.  2004, 

Lenormand  et  al.  2004,  Trepat  et  al.  2005),  the Θ  dependance  is  included  in  the  factor β 

(formula B6), numerically computed in a finite element model (Mijailovitch et al. 2002). A 

comparison limited to the bead rotation contributions in both cases shows that the numerical 

prefactor in (B5) is about twice the one in (B7). This may partly explain why, for the same 

cell  type,  the  reported  values  of  G0M  are  smaller  in  OT  experiments  than  in  OMTC 

experiments. 

iii) It is known that the mechanical properties are not homogeneous inside a same cell, 

and  also  depend  on  the  cell  activity.  For  fibroblasts,  Kole  et  al.  (Kole  et  al.  2005)  have 

measured that the stiffness in the lamellipodium, where the actin network is denser, is about 

four times higher than in the perinuclear region. This difference almost vanishes for quiescent 

fibroblasts.  Besides,  for  migrating  neutrophils,  Yanai  et  al.  showed  that  <G0>  is  almost  10 

times smaller in the leading edge than in the cell body or tail (Yanai et al. 2005). In this case 

the  relative  fluidity  of  the  pseudopod  may  be  related  to  a  cytoplasmic  flow,  driven  by  a 

pressure  gradient.  For  spread  cells  like  HeLa,  the  viscosity  experienced  by  magnetic 

endosomes  embedded  in  the  cytoplasm  is  found  on  average  eight  times  higher  in  the 

perinuclear  region  than  further  away  from  the  cell  center  (Wilhelm  et  al.  2003).  In  this  last 

case the correlation to the cell rigidity is not explicited. Other authors (Maksym et al. 2000) 

have  reported  that  the  average  cellular  medium  rigidity  decreases  by  several  orders  of 

magnitude  when  the  size  of  the  mechanical  probe  increases  from  a  few  tens  nanometers 

 

15

24/03/2006 

(AFM tip) to a few microns (micropipettes). Although such observations may depend on the 

cellular  type,  and  consequently  general  trends  are  not  easy  to  derive,  these  different  factors 

may contribute to the dispersion reported above. 

iv) Cell viscoelastic properties are also sensitive to the temperature. Lo and Ferrier (Lo 

and  Ferrier,  1999)  performed  mechanical  tests on  osteosarcoma  cells, and  observed  that  the 

average  stiffness,  estimated  from  a  Kelvin-Voigt model, decreases by a factor 1.5 when the 

temperature  increases  from  22°C  to  37  °C.  This  effect  probably  contributes  to  explain  the 

difference  between  the  high  G0M  (or  <G0>)  values  measured  on  A549  and  BEAS-2B  cells 

with AFM at 20°C (Trepat et al. 2005, Alcaraz et al. 2003) and the lower ones measured by 

OT or MTC techniques at 37 °C (this work, Fabry et al. 2003, Puig-de-Morales et al. 2001).  

v)  Comparing  the  transmission  of  the  mechanical  signals  through  different  kinds  of 

receptors  remains  largely  an  open  question.  On  HASM  cells  probed  by  MTC,  it  has  been 

shown that the power law exponent does not significantly vary when the bead is covered by 

RGD  (binding  to  β1  integrin),  vitronectin  VN  (preferentially  binding  to  β3  integrin),  uPA 

urokinase (indirectly binding to the cytoskeleton via caveolin), or AcLDL (which binds to a 

non-adhesive site, not linked to the cytoskeleton) (Puig-de-Morales et al. 2004). However, in 

the same conditions, the relative value of G0M decreases by a factor of 4 from RGD to VN, 

and a factor of 10 from RGD to uPA or AcLDL. In this work, we report a difference in the 

viscoelastic  coefficients  measured  on  the  same  A549  cells  through  integrin  and  ICAM-1 

receptors on the one hand, on the same C2 cells through glutaraldehyde and cadherin on the 

other hand (table 1). However, in all these studies, the amount of coating was never precisely 

controlled, which may also bias the results (see below point vi). Further works are necessary 

before drawing conclusions about the influence of the receptor/ligand couple.  . 

vi) Finally, this analysis must include questionning about the structure of the contact 

itself, which depends on the amount of molecular bonds, and on the dynamical evolution due 

to  cytoskeletal  remodeling.  Concerning  this  last  point,  it  is  known  that  applying  a  constant 

stress at a focal contact induces within a few minutes local recruitment of integrin, actin and 

other proteins involved in the contact assembly, which reinforces the contact (Choquet et al. 

1997,  Riveline  et  al.  2001).  A  similar  effect  was  observed  on  adherent  junctions  (Delanoë-

Ayari  et  al.  2004).  Bursac  et  al.  (Bursac  et  al.  2005)  have  observed    that  applying  a  high 

amplitude  oscillating  stress  to  a  magnetic  bead  bound  to  the  cell  makes  immediately  the 

contact  more  compliant,  and  that  the  contact  strengthens  again  within  a  few  minutes  after 

releasing the stress. But to our knowledge, there is no report of the evolution of G0 during the 

spontaneous formation of a bead-cell contact, nor during its reinforcement under a continuous 

 

16

stress.  A  related  concern  is  to  determine  how  the  initial  number  of  molecular  bonds  at  the 

bead-cell  contact  affects  the  mechanical  response.  The  coating  protocol  of  the  bead  by  the 

ligand is obviously a key step, but no method has been yet reported to quantify the amount of 

24/03/2006 

ligand in a reliable way.  

 

The  above  discussion  points  out  the  existence  of  numerous  physical  and  biological 

parameters, which may interfere in opposite ways, and probably induce the large dispersion of 

the  measured  values  of  the  parameter  G0.  In  the  absence  of  more  selective  experiments 

focusing on the influence of each parameter, it is yet not possible to go further into a detailed 

interpretation of the observed differences.   

V - A model for the rheological behavior of a single cell 

There  are  numerous  examples  in  the  litterature  of  complex  viscoelastic  systems 

showing power law rheological behaviors. This is for instance the case of colloidal systems 

close  to  the  sol/gel  transition  (Ponton  et  al.,  2002),  or  of  "soft  glassy  materials",  which 

includes  foams,  pastes,  emulsions  and  slurries  (Weeks  et  al.  2000,  Bonn  et  al.  2002).  A 

common feature of all these systems is that, due to their structural complexity, their dynamics 

cannot  be  described  by  a  small,  finite  number  of  relaxation  times.  In  these  systems,  the 

mechanical dissipation must take into account multi-scale dynamical processes, so that their 

response to an external mechanical stress involves a broad and dense distribution of relaxation 

times.  Soft  glassy  materials  are  systems  dominated  by  structural  disorder,  metastability  and 

rearrangements, and a general description of their mechanical properties has been developed 

(Bouchaud, 1992, Sollich, 1998). This model might appear as a good candidate to describe the 

cell medium. Indeed, it is an out-of-equilibrium, disordered and active system, in which the 

rearrangements (through dynamical crosslinking, actin polymerization and molecular motors 

activity) are made possible by an external supply of chemical energy.  

However,  at  the  present  stage,  the  analogy  between  the  general  description  of  soft 

glassy  materials  and  the  cytoskeleton  network  dynamics  remains  quite  formal,  since  the 

elementary  biophysical  and  biochemical  mechanisms  which  govern  the  cytoskeleton 

rearrangements are not explicited in this description. Some authors have developped a more 

phenomelogical approach, where the cytoskeletal network is seen as a polarized liquid crystal, 

and  its  dynamics  is  coupled  to  the  activity  of  molecular  motors  (Kruse  et  al.  2004). 

Quantitative predictions about the microrheological behavior of the cellular medium has yet 

to be obtained from this model.  

 

 

 

17

24/03/2006 

Here  we  propose  another  description,  intermediate  between  formal  comportemental 

approaches  and  more  phenomenological  structural  models.  We  modelize  the  cytoskeleton 

network  as  an  infinite  assembly  of  elementary  units  labelled  by  the  index  i,  each  of  them 

showing  a  simple  Kelvin-Voigt  behavior  with  a  response  time  τi  (see  figure  10a).  The 

elementary creep function ji(t) associated to each unit i is such that

=

exp(

−

dj
i
dt

)t
τ
i

  

Each  of  these  units  may  account  for  the  mechanical  behavior  at  a  particular  length 

scale  in  the  cell,  from  the  smallest  one  (single  actin  filament),  to  the  largest  (actin  bundle, 

stress fiber). Since these different structures are distributed on a wide range of sizes, from the 

nanometer  scale  to  the  whole  cell  scale,  it  is  reasonnable  to  assume  that  the  characteristic 

response  times  τi  are  widely  and  densely  distributed.  This  is  of  course  a  simplified 

description,  since  at  this  stage  it  does  not  explicitely  represent  the  active  molecular 

mechanisms that may take place inside each single unit, due to the molecular motor activity or 

to the filaments remodelling. However, it should be possible to include them in a further step 

without  modifying  the  architecture  of  this  multi-scale  contruction.  Actually,  a  precise 

description  of  the  elastic  and  dissipation  processes  at  the  molecular  level  may  not  be 

necessary  to  derive  macroscopic  mechanical  behaviors:  the  model  associates  at  every  given 

scale a spring and a dashpot, which schematically represent the storage of the elastic energy in 

actin  filaments,  bundles,  and  stress  fibers,  and  its  dissipation  through  cytoskeleton 

remodelling,  molecular  motors  activity  and  passive  viscosity.  This  multi-scale  coupling 

between  elasticity  and  dissipation  processes  is  a  main  characteristic  of  structural  damping. 

Notice  that  we  have  chosen  for  convenience  to  associate  the  elementary  units  in  series. 

Nevertheless, this choice does not restrict the generality of our model, since an association in 

parallel would lead to the same results.   

 

The next important ingredient of this model is the distribution P(τi) of relaxation times 

τi . A commonly used assumption in several models of complex viscoelastic solids is that the 

relaxation times are distributed according to a power law

(Oustaloup, 1995). In 

this case it is straightforward to show that the creep function response J(t) of the system also 

follows a power law of time. Indeed the resulting time derivative of the creep function may be 

calculated as:

Following  this  approach,  we  assume  that,  in  the  cell,  the  elementary  Kelvin-Voigt 

units representing the cytoskeleton dynamics are themselves distributed according to a power 

law of their typical size l. This means that the number of units having a given size l is simply 

proportional to l-ξ, where ξ>0 represents the fractal dimension of the network. If the response 

time τ of the unit of size l is also a simple power function of l, the distribution of τ  will itself 

be a power law of τ :

The following calculations are developped in two steps:  

- in a first step (i) we assume an ideal power law repartition P0 of the response time τi, 

and we show indeed that the resulting creep function J0(t) is a power law of time. 

- in a second one (ii) we use a set of distributions Pk, extracted from P0 by randomly 

deleting  a  given  fraction  of  the  response  times τi.  We  calculate  for  each  distribution  Pk  the 

new  creep  function  Jk(t),  and  analyse  the  distribution  of  Jk(t)  over  different  Pk.  As  will  be 

shown  in  the  discussion,  this  distribution  mimicks  the  distribution  of  experimental  J(t) 

measured for a set of cells belonging to the same cell type.

To  take  into  account  the  actual  discrete  character  of  the  τi  distribution,  we  have 

performed numerical simulations, where we calculated the exact value of

)(J0 θ&

, as a function 

of  the  reduced  time θ  =  t/τ

m.  The  resulting  function,  shown  in  figure  11  (top  curve)  for  a 
typical value α = 0.20 of the exponent, was obtained by summing 105 elementary units (i = 1 
to  105).  This  covers  6  orders  of  magnitude  (from  1  to  10-6)  for  the  reduced  response 

times τι/τm.  As expected, 

)(J0 θ&

 is perfectly adjusted by a power law of exponent α -1 = - 0.8, 

in  the  range  10

-6  < θ  <  1.  An  increased  number  of  elementary  units  would  only  extend  the 

range of validity of the power law at the smallest times : it is therefore unnecessary. 

ii) In order to build a more realistic picture of the cytoskeleton dynamics, we assume 

now  that  only  a  proportion  p  of  the  elementary  Kelvin-Voigt  units  are  actually  present  in  a 

given cell. Indeed, the response times τi are very unlikely to follow the smooth distribution P0 

in a real cell. One has to take into account the dispersion of results actually observed from one 

cell to the other. A given cell should then be represented by its actual distribution Pk of time 

constants,  constructed  by  selecting,  with  a  given  probability  p,  a  random  set  of  relaxation 

times τi from the distribution P0. An example of Pk distribution is schematically represented in 

figure  10c,  together  with  the  original  P0  distribution.  Under  these  assumptions,  the  creep 

function  Jk(t)  of  the  k-cell  will  be  calculated  from 

,  where  pi  is  a  random 

variable  equal  to  1  with  a  probability  p  and  to  0  with  a  probability  1-p.  The  underlying 

response times τi remain distributed according to

figure 11 (lower curves), for 500 different realizations of Pk distributions (k = 1 to 500), with 
the same probability p = 0.1. These curves show that, at least in the range 10-6 < θ < 10-2, all 

the

 functions roughly behave as power laws of θ , and exhibit approximately the same

The  histograms  of αk  and  bk  are  presented  in  figure  12a  and  12b.  The  distribution  of αk  is 

symetric,  and  is  well  fitted  by  a  gaussian  curve  centered  on  the  value  α =  0.20.  On  the 

contrary, the histogram of bk is clearly asymetric, but one recovers the symetry by plotting the 

histogram  of  ln(bk)  (figure  12c).  A  first  prediction  of  these  simulations  is  that,  over  several

realizations  mimicking  the  natural  dispersion  over  different  cells,  the  exponents  αk  and 

prefactors bk are respectively normally and log-normally distributed. As shown in section VI, 

this  is  quite  consistent  with  the  normal  and  log-normal  distributions  of  α  and  G0 

experimentally measured on a given set of cells. The width of the distributions calculated in 

the simulations depends on the drawing probability p. In the following, the particular value p 

= 0.1 has been chosen to match the standard deviations of experimental data.  

Another important feature emerging from these simulations is that the exponent αk and 

prefactor  bk  of  the  power  law 

)(Jk θ&

are  not  independent  parameters.  Figure  13  represents  a 

plot of ln(b

k) vs αk for 500 different realisations (k = 1 to 500): ln(bk) and αk appear strongly 

correlated through a linear relationship. The slope

the  choice  of  drawing  probability  p  =  0.1.  Other  numerical  tests  (not  shown  here),  indicate 

that this slope s is almost independent of the choice of p in a wide range: 0.01<p<0.8. We will 

use s = 10 ± 0.5 to compare this result with experiments in the next section.  

 

 

 

VI - Discussion 

We have noticed in section III that, for a given set of cells belonging to the same cell 

type  and  submitted  to  the  same  experimental  protocol,  the  measured  exponents  α  and 

prefactors G0 at f=1Hz respectively follow a normal and a log-normal distribution (figures 5, 

7,  8  and  9).  In  the  model  presented  in  section  V,  the  variability  from  one  cell  to  another  is 

simulated by the choice of a particular distribution Pk of response times τi, randomly selected 

amongst  a  general  power  law  distribution  P0.  We  have  already  pointed  out  that  this  model 

also  leads  to  normal  and  log-normal  distributions  for  the  exponents  αk   and  prefactors  bk 

determining the creep function Jk(t). Introducing a dimensionless time θ = t/τm, normalized by 

the  largest  time  relaxation τm  of  the  cell,  we  have  shown  that

As  far  as  the  exponents  αk  remain  close  to  the  averaged  value  α,  a  log-normal 

distribution for bk corresponds to a log-normal distribution for G0k ∝ 1/ bk. This demonstrates 

that so far the model predictions are consistent with experimental data.

To step further into the comparison beween the model and the data,  it is noteworthy to 

focus  on  the  correlations  between  exponents αk  and  prefactors  G0k  .  Figure  14  gathers  the 

experimental  data  of  ln(G0)  versus  α  for  all  the  C2  cells,  as  determined  either  in  optical 

tweezers  or  uniaxial  stretching  experiments.  Despite  a  noticeable  dispersion  of  the  results, 

ln(G0)  appears  to  be  an  increasing  function  of  the  exponent α.  This  is  consistent  with  the 

model presented in section V, which predicts a correlation between ln(bk) and αk. Imposing a 

linear relationship between ln(G0) and α in Figure 14, one measures a slope

 is the digamma function (Gradshteyn and Ryzhik, 1980). It is 

possible  to  make  the  measured  value  s'  =  5.2  consistent  with  the  predicted  value  s  =  10  by 

adjusting the only unknown parameter in our modelτm, which represents the longest relaxation 

time in the cell. This adjustment leads to τm ~ 3200 s for the C2 cell type. Since θ = t/τm, the 
reduced  time  range  10-6  < θ  <  10-2  then  corresponds  to  a  real  time  range  0.003  <  t  <  30s, 

which  exactly  matches  the  experimental  range  of  our  measurements.  This  reinforces  the 

validity of our approach.  

The  same  analysis,  performed  on  our  data  on  alveolar  epithelial  cells  A549,  also 

showed a correlation between the measured exponents αk and prefactors G0k (data not shown). 

From the slope 

's

= 2.8 we infer that the highest response time is τm ~ 300 s for

this  type  of  cells.  Other  experiments  (Fabry  et  al.  2003)  also  depicted  a  linear  relationship 

between  the  viscoelastic  modulus  G1  (measured  at  1  kHz)  and  the  exponent α  for  HASM 

cells. In their case, the slope

d

2003), yields a typical time τm ~ 3200 s.  

 

It is remarkable that these estimates of the longest time response in different cell types, 

derived from different experiments, are roughly consistent with each other and lie in the range 

5  min-1hour.  Moreover,  we  emphasize  that  their  common  order  of  magnitude  is  quite 

reasonnable, as far as it effectively corresponds to a typical relaxation time at the scale of the 

 

22

24/03/2006 

whole  cell.  Indeed,  an  independant  rough  evaluation  of τm  may  be  obtained  by  dividing  a 

typical  value  of  the  cytoplasm  viscosity  at  long  time  scale  (~  10  kPa.s)  (Sato  et  al.  1990, 
Thoumine and Ott, 1997) by a typical Young modulus (~102 Pa) measured at the cell scale in 

quasi-static  experiments.  Beyond  this  time  range,  some  macroscopic  remodelling  processes 

(treadmilling,  signalization  cascades)  are  known  to  take  place  and  to  interfere  with  the  cell 

mechanical properties.  

VII – Summary and conclusions 

This  study  makes  a  parallel  analysis  of  the  results  obtained  by  two  different 

microrheological  experiments  on  single  living  cells,  and  compares  them  with  other  data 

gathered from various works in the litterature. It allows to bring out some striking common 

features in the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton network.  

The  mechanical  response  function  presents  a  quasi-universal  power  law  behavior, 

whatever the experimental technique and the cellular type: the viscoelastic complex modulus 

of the cell is a power law function of the exciting mechanical frequency f. Correlatively the 

creep  function  of  the  intracellular  medium  is  a  power  law  of  elapsed  time,  with  the  same 

exponent α. The value of this exponent α ≈ 0.2 is remarkably homogeneous throughout the 

large panel of studied cellular types, whatever the experimental techniques and conditions. It 

does not seem to either depend on the probe size, nor on the typical length scale on which the 

experiment is performed. This clearly demonstrates that there is no characteristic dissipation 

time  in  the  cellular  response,  or  more  precisely  that  these  relaxation  times  are  broadly 

distributed  over  a  wide  time  interval,  extending  at  least  from  0.01s  to  100s.  This  is  a 

characteristic  of  structural  damping,  where  the  mechanisms  responsible  for  the  storage  of 

elastic energy and its dissipation are strongly correlated.  

Moreover,  the  prefactor  of  the  response  function,  which  represents  the  value  of  the 

elastic  modulus  at  a  given  reference  frequency,  varies  by  almost  two  orders  of  magnitude, 

according  to  the  cellular  type  and  to  the  experimental  conditions.  Interestingly,  for  a  set  of 

cells of a given type, probed in the same experiment, the prefactor distribution is found log-

normal.  The  possible  influence  of  several  physical  or  biological  parameters  on  the  average 

value of this prefactor is discussed: temperature, probe size, nature the mechanical receptor, 

cell inhomogeneities. Further studies should concentrate on systematic comparisons between 

different  cell  types,  probed  in  identical  experimental  conditions:  this  is  the  only  way  to  - 

perhaps - associate a given cell function with a characteristic viscoelastic behavior.  

 

 

23

24/03/2006 

The  semi-phenomenological  model  presented  here  is  able  to  accurately  predict  the 

mechanical response of a living cell submitted to a controlled stress, in a wide range of  time 

scales.  The  mechanical  behavior  of  the  cell  is  modelized  by  associating  a  large  number  of 

elementary  Kelvin-Voigt  units,  which  account  for  the  different  scales  of  the  cytoskeletal 

network.  Assuming  a  self-similar  structure  of  the  network  and  a  power  law  distribution  of 

time  constants,  one  recovers  all  the  features  of  the  macroscopic  behavior  observed  on 

different  cell  types.  This  approach  quantitatively  accounts  for  the  power  law  responses 

measured  in  different  rheological  experiments,  and  also  for  the  normal  and  log-normal 

distributions retrieved for the exponents and prefactors. The largest relaxation time in the cell, 

which  is  the  only  adjustable  parameter  of  the  model,  is  consistent  with  other  independant 

estimates.  A  further  step  will  consist  in  interpreting  the  dissipative  elements  in  term  of 

elementary  biological  mechanisms,  such  as  molecular  motors  activity  and  crosslinkers 

dynamics, which play a crucial role in the cytoskeleton remodelling.

APPENDIX  B:  Force/displacement  relationship  for  a  bead  partially 

immersed in an elastic medium.  

We  recall  here  the  main  results  of  the  analytic  calculation  of  the  displacement  of  a 

rigid spherical bead, immersed in a semi-infinite homogeneous medium, and submitted to a 

r
force  F

 tangential to the medium boundary (see figure 3) (Laurent et al. 2002). We assume 

that the medium is incompressible, so that the static Young modulus E and the shear modulus 

µ are related by E = 3µ.  

i) Bead immersed in an infinite medium 

In  the  simple  case  of  an  infinite  incompressible  medium,  the  displacement  x  of  the 

center  of  the  bead  submitted  to  a  force  F  is  given  by  (Ziemann  et  al.1994,  Laudau  et  al. 

1959):

Where R represents the bead radius. 

ii) Bead in contact by a small area with a semi-infinite medium  

This  case  corresponds  to  a  bead  weekly  immersed  in  the  medium:  the  angle  of 

immersion Θ  (defined in figure 3) is small. We have shown (Laurent et al. 2002) that in this 

limit the displacement x of the bead center results of the combination of a translation of the 

bead and a rotation around the region of contact, and that F and x are related  through: 

 

 

26

 In  the  denominator,  the  first  term  stands  for  the  contribution  of  the  bead  translation, 

the  second  one  for  its  rotation.    This  analytic  expression  is  consistent  with  other  numerical 

studies describing the pure rotation of a magnetic bead submitted to a torque (Mijailovitch et 

al.  2002,  Ohayon  et  al.  2004).  In  particular,  all  the  works  agree  on  the  fact  that  the  bead 
rotation  is  proportional  to  sin3Θ.  Only  the  numerical  prefactor  differs  by  approximatively  a 

factor of two between the analytical and numerical approaches. We have shown in (Laurent et 

al.  2002)  that  equation  (B3)  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  full  range  of  angle Θ  accessible  to 

experiment, typically 20° < Θ  < 70°. As a consequence, we use this equation to interpret our 

data in the main course of this paper. 

Equation  (B1)  to  (B3)  describe  the  force/displacement  relationship  in  the  static  case 

where  F  (and  x)  are  kept  constant  with  time.  When  the  bead  is  submitted  to  an  oscillatory 

force F = 

(Fˆ ω exp(jω t), they can be generalized to define the viscoelastic complex modulus

for the cas of partial immersion. Here we assume that f(Θ) keeps the same expression as in 

(B3).  In  this  definition,  Ge  reduces  to  the  Young  modulus  E  as  the  frequency  goes  to  zero. 

Notice that this convention is different from the one proposed by other authors (Mijailovitch) 

who define a viscoelastic modulus Gs= Ge/3 from the shear modulus µ. For instance, in the 

case of magnetic beads, the bead rotation Φ is related to the applied specific torque Ts (torque

FIGURE CAPTIONS 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure 1: View of the uniaxial stretching rheometer. A single cell is attached by specific or 

non specific binding to a rigid glass microplate (bottom) and a flexible one (top). The stiffness 

of the flexible plate is calibrated, so that one simultaneously measures the force applied to the 

cell,  and  its  deformation.  A  feedback  loop  allows  to  apply  a  constant  stress  to  the  cell,  and 

thus to retrieve its creep function J(t). 

Figure 2: Principle of the measurements of the complex viscoelastic modulus G(ω), using the 

optical  tweezers  setup.  A  micrometric  glass  bead,  specifically  bound  to  given  membrane 

receptors, is trapped in the focused laser beam, and is used as a handle to apply a force to the 

cytoskeleton.  The  experimental  chamber  is  submitted  to  a  sinusoïdal  displacement  at 

frequency f=ω/2π, while the optical trap is kept at a fixed position. The applied force and the 

cell deformation are deduced from the displacements of the bead xb and of the chamber xc.   

Figure  3:  Scheme  of  a  bead  partially  embedded  into  a  cell,  considered  as  a  semi-infinite 

viscoelastic medium. In the optical tweezers experiments, the force F is applied tangentially 

to  the  cell  membrane.  The  derivation  of  the  complex  viscoelastic  modulus  G(ω)  takes  into 

account the value of the angle of immersion Θ, which is measured from the video recordings. 

Figure 4: Plot of the creep function J(t), measured for a single C2 myoblast with the stretching 

rheometer. Here the cell is attached to the glass plates through glutaraldehyde coating. Over 
three decades in time, J(t) is very well fitted by a power law J(t) = A0(t/t0)α. For this particular 

cell, the exponent α is found equal to 0.25. 

Figure 5: Histograms of the distributions of the exponents α (5a) and of the logarithms of the 

prefactors  ln(G0)  (5b),  measured  with  the  stretching  rheometer  on  a  set  of  43  C2  myoblasts, 

attached to the plates through glutaraldehyde coating. The cumulative distributions of α and 

ln(G0) are also plotted (black dots). They are correctly fitted by an error function 1+ erf [(x-

<x>)/a]  (blue  lines).  This  indicates  that  the  distribution  of  the  exponents  α is  a  normal 

distribution, and that the distribution of the prefactors G0 is log-normal. The fits give the best 

estimates  for  the  average  exponent  <α>  =  0.242  ±  0.013,  and  for  the  median  value  of  the 

prefactor G0M = exp(<ln(G0)>) = 660 (+80/-70) Pa.

Figure 6: Plot of the modulus |Ge| and of the phase δ  of the complex viscoelastic coefficient 

Ge(ω) measured with optical tweezers, as a function of the frequency f=ω/2π, for a single C2 

myoblast.  The  bead  is  coated  with  RGD  peptides  and  binds  to  integrins.  |Ge|  behaves  as  a 

power law of f over three frequency decades, with an exponent α here found equal to 0.30. 

The phase shift δ remains constant in the studied frequency range. This is consistent with the 

power law behavior of the creep function J(t) measured with the stretching rheometer for the 

same C2 cell type.  

Figure 7: Histograms of the distributions of the exponents α (7a) and of the logarithms of the 

prefactors ln(G0) (7b), measured with the optical tweezers on a set of 22 C2 myoblasts.  The 

beads bind to integrins via RGD coating. The cumulative distributions (black dots) are well 

adjusted by an error (erf) function (blue line). The best estimate for the average exponent is 

<α> = 0.208 ± 0.021, and for the median value of the prefactor is G0M = 310 (+130/-100) Pa. 

Figure 8: Histograms of the distributions of the exponents α (8a) and of the logarithms of the 

prefactors  ln(G0)  (8b),  measured  with  the  optical  tweezers  on  a  set  of  23  epithelial  alveolar 

cells A549. The beads bind to integrins via RGD coating. The distributions of α and G0 are 

normal and log-normal, respectively. From the erf fits of the cumulated distributions, the best 

estimate  for  the  average  exponent  is  <α>  =  0.219  ±  0.014,  and  for  the  median  value  of  the 

prefactor is G0M = 420 (+80/-70) Pa. 

Figure 9: Histograms of the distributions of the exponents α (9a) and of the logarithms of the 

prefactors  ln(G0)  (9b),  measured  with  the  optical  tweezers  on  a  set  of  19  epithelial  alveolar 

cells  A549.  The  beads  bind  to  integrins  via  anti-ICAM1  coating.  From  the  erf  fit  of  the 

cumulated distributions, the best estimate for the average exponent is <α> = 0.181 ± 0.014, 

and for the median value of the prefactor is G0M = = 80 (+25/-20) Pa. 

Figure 10: The cytoskeleton network is modelized as an infinite assembly of elementary units 

labelled by the index i, each of them showing a simple Kelvin-Voigt behavior with a response 

time  τi  (Fig  10a).  In  the  ideal  case,  the  relaxation  times  τi  are  assumed  to  be  exactly

natural  dispersion,  a  given  cell  k  is  modelized  by  a  proportion  p<1  of  relaxation  times, 

randomly selected from P0.  An example of distribution Pk is represented in Fig. 10c. 

Figure 11: Plot of the time derivative of the creep function dJ/dθ, numerically calculated for 

the  ideal  power  law  distribution  P0    (top  curve),  and  for  20  more  realistic  distributions  Pk  

(bottom  curves)  randomly  extracted  from  P0    as  explained  in  the  text.  The  time  scale  is 
normalized  by  the  largest  time  relaxation  in  the  cell  τm.  The  simulations  involve  105 

elementary  units,  and  the  reference  exponent  in  the  distribution  P0  is  equal  to  0.20.  As 

expected,  the  response  function  dJ0/dθ  corresponding  to  the  distribution  P0  exactly  merges 
into a power law (dashed curve) of exponent α-1= -0.8, in the range  10-6 < θ < 1. For the 

distributions Pk , the response functions dJk/dθ are well adjusted by power laws in the range  
10-6 < θ < 10-2, with a distribution of exponents αk close to α. 

Figure  12:  Histograms  of  the  distributions  of  the  exponents  αk  (12a),  of  the  prefactors  bk  

(12b),  and  of  their  logarithms  ln(bk)  (12c).  These  quantities  are  measured  from  the 

numerically calculated curves dJ0/dθ, for 500 different realizations of Pk distribution.  While 

the  distribution  of  exponents αk  is  symmetrical,  the  distribution  of  prefactors  bk  is  clearly 

asymmetric.  The  cumulated  distributions  and  their  best  fits  by  erf  functions  are  also 

represented (12a and 12c). They show that, according to this model, αk and bk  are respectively 

normally and log-normally distributed. 

Figure 13: Plot of the prefactors ln(bk)   vs  exponents αk, for 500 different realizations of Pk 

distribution. As can be seen, the model predicts a strong linear correlation between these two 

quantities.  

Figure 14: Plot of the experimental values of the prefactors ln(G0) vs exponents α, measured 

for  C2  myoblasts.  The  data  from  optical  tweezers  experiments  (disks)  and  stretching 

rheometer  experiments  (squares)  are  plotted  together.  Despite  the  dispersion  of  the  results, 

ln(G0)  appears  to  be  an  increasing  function  of  the  exponent α.  This  is  consistent  with  the 

prediction of the model.

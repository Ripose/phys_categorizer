1.  INTRODUCTION

Our  objective  here  is  twofold:  first,  to  describe  a  general  method  to
obtain in  a simple way complete  expressions  for  the  elements  of  general  Lie
groups.  Second, to present a treatment leading to complete,  closed expressions
for  the Lie  algebra  invariants  of  matrix  groups.  In  these  times  of  increasing
algebraic  computing resources,  it  is always interesting  to  have  such  formulae
as  inputs  for  applications.  Besides  their  obvious  interest  by  themselves,  the
detailed forms  of  the  invariants  serve  as  a  powerful  checking  control  in  the
rather messy calculations leading to the expressions for  finite  transformations.
These expressions, of course, are  of  interest  by  themselves. Even  if  particular
cases (such as a rotation  around  the fixed  axis Oz or  a  boost  in  the  x-t  plane
for  the  Lorentz  group)  are  enough  for  most  purposes,  only  the  general
expressions show the complete interplay  between  the  different  components  at
work in a transformation. The procedure to get at  them provide,  furthermore,
good illustrations  for  the results  on  the  invariants.  The  two  things  help  each
other, and are better presented together.

The  transformation  parameters  (rotation  angles,  boost  rapidities,
translations  in  time  and space) are  the components of  the  generic  member  of
the Lie  algebra  written  in  a  matrix  basis  formed  by  the  generators.  A  finite
transformation  is  a  group  element,  the  exponential  of  the  algebra  member.
General expressions for group elements can in principle  be obtained by  simple
order-by-order exponentiation, but  for  large  matrices  the identification of  the
successive  powers  can  become  very  difficult.  However,  if  we  use  the  well-
known  definition  of  function  of  a  matrix,  only  a  few  powers  are  necessary
even in the general case.

The  closed  expressions  for  the  Lie  algebra  invariants,  scalar  and
operatorial, are presented in section 2. Though not quite  necessary to  arrive  at
the final exponentials for the group elements, they are  interesting  for  checking
purposes and become more and more useful as the matrix dimensions grow up.
The treatment involving the characteristic polynomial and symmetric  functions
of its roots sheds light on many aspects of the question. In the later  sections we
illustrate  the approach  with  the general  expressions for  Lorentz  and  Poincaré
transformations.  The  method  is  particularly  simple  when  all  the  roots  (the

4

matrix  eigenvalues) are  simple. The  presence of  multiple  roots,  as is  the  case
for the Galilei group, requires a special treatment.

j><l

In  section  3  we  present  the  general  method  for  obtaining  the  group
elements. We called it the "Z-method", since it uses the "eigenprojectors"  Zj =
|l

j| of a finite matrix A with eigenvalues {l
In  section  4  we  present  an  example  of  invariants  which  are  very
important  in  gauge  theories:  the  closed  differential  forms  describing  the
characteristic  classes  of  fiber  bundles  on  even-dimensional  differentiable
manifolds.

}.

The  general  expression  for  a  homogeneous  Lorentz  transformation  is
obtained in section 5, and that for an  inhomogeneous transformation  in  section
6.  For  these  examples  we  can  use  a  simple  version  of  the  Z-method,  which
supposes  all  the  eigenvalues  to  be  distinct.  The  generic  member  of  the  Lie
algebra  of  the Galilei group  has a  multiple  eigenvalue,  so  that  the  procedure
would not work. In section 7 we show, however, how to obtain it from  a more
general theory.

The  appendix  presents  some  results  on  symmetric  functions  which  are

largely used in section 2 and 4.

2.  LIE  ALGEBRA  INVARIANTS

We  start  by  recalling  some  well-known  definitions.  The  characteristic

polynomial (in the complex variable l ) of a matrix  A is the determinant

D (l ) = det [l I-A] . 

The roots of D (l ), solutions of the secular equation

D (l ) = (l -l 1)(l -l 2)(l -l 3) . . . (l -l N)  = 0,

(2.1)

(2.2)

constitute the spectrum of  A,  the set Sp A =  {l 1,  l 2,  l 3,  .  .  .  l N} of  complex
numbers  for  which  the  resolvent,  or  characteristic  matrix    [l I-A],  is  not
invertible.

We are interested  in  matrices  A belonging to  a Lie  algebra.  Clearly  the
trace  of  A is an invariant  under  the similarity  transformation  A'  =  g-1Ag,  as
tr(g-1Ag) = tr(gg-1A) = tr A. The trace of any power of A will be invariant,  as

5

(2.3)

trA'k = tr(g-1Agg-1Agg-1Ag . . . g-1Ag) = tr(g-1Akg) = trAk. The  characteristic
polynomial is an invariant because, once written in the canonical form

D (l ) =(cid:229)

 l N-j j

j[A],

N

j=0

each coefficient j
j[A] is an invariant.  These coefficients are  invariant  because
they can be written in terms of powers  of  the above traces  of  powers  of  A.  In
order to see it,  we need their  detailed form,  which involves Bell polynomials.
Let us recall briefly what such polynomials are.

Given a formal series of the form g(t) = (cid:229)

g j
j!  tj, the corresponding  Bell

 
j=1

polynomials are defined by

Bnk(g1, g2, . . . , gn-k+1) = 

n

1

  k !  { d

  [g(t)]k}t=0 .
n
dt

(2.4)

They  are  multivariable  polynomials  in  the  Taylor  coefficients  gi.  Their
detailed expression is rather  involved (Comtet,  1974),  but  they  appear  in  the
multinomial theorem,

g j
j! tj)k =  (cid:229)

t n  
n!

 
n=k

 Bnk(g1, g2, . . . , gn-k+1),

(2.5)

which provides  the easiest way to  obtain most of  their  properties.  We use the
alternative  notations  Bnk[g]  =  Bnk(g1,  g2,  .  .  .  ,  gn-k+1)  =  Bnk{gr},  the
expression inside the latter  bracket  being the typical argument.  By convention
we put Bj0 = d
j0. The matrices B[g] = (Bnk[g]) have many important properties
(Aldrovandi  and  Monte  Lima,  1980,  1983),  but  we  shall  only  state  those  of
interest to our particular case. A property of consequence in what follows is

Bnk (ag1, a2g2, . . . , an-k+1gn-k+1) = Bnk {ajgj} = an Bnk {gj} 

(2.6)

for  a  constant  a.  It  comes  from  a  simple  change  of  variable  t  ﬁ
multinomial theorem. In particular, when a is only a sign, a = - 1, we have

  at  in  the

Bnk{(-)jgj} = (-)n Bnk {gj}.

the  "complete  Bell  polynomial"  of  g(x).  We  shall  obtain  the  Lie  algebra

j[A] = 

j

(-1)j
j!

m=0

 Bjm{(-)k-1(k-1)!  tr(Ak)}.

(2.10)

These complete Bell polynomials contain only powers of traces of powers of A
and are clearly invariant. A particularly  beautiful relation  comes out  when we
put l

 = 0, z = 1 in (2.9):

det A = 

 BNm{(-)k-1(k-1)!tr(Ak)} .

(2.11)

N! (cid:229)

m=0

In  the  present  case,  this  states  the  well-known  fact  that  the  zeroth-order
coefficient of the characteristic polynomial of A is just the determinant of A.

Take now for the matrix a generic member

A = w aJa 

(2.12)

of a Lie algebra of a Lie group with generators Ja, a = 1, 2, . .  .  ,  N.  The  w a's
are  the transformation  parameters.  A group  element will  be of  the  form  g  =
exp[A].  The  group  acts  on  A  by  the  adjoint  N· N  representation,  that  is,  by
similarity transformations:  A ﬁ  A'  =  g-1Ag. As the characteristic  polynomial
does not  change under  these transformations,  it  is an example of  an  invariant
polynomial  on  a  Lie  algebra.  Summing  up,  D (l )  is  a  polynomial  in  the

which are themselves Bell polynomials in the traces  of  powers  of  A.  The  rank
j(w
of  the Lie  algebra  is the number  of  coefficients j

j/¶
independent, that is, the rank of  the matrix  (¶

the classification of  Lie  groups  (Goldberg,  l962).  For  semisimple groups,  g
ab
is a metric  (that  is,  a  symmetric  non-degenerate  bilinear  form),  the  Killing-
Cartan  metric.  This  form  will  be  of  definite  sign  for  compact  groups,  non-
definite for non-compact groups and degenerate for non-semisimple groups.
 
Of  course,  a  function  of  invariants  is  also  an  invariant,  and  it  is
sometimes convenient to choose another  set. Those given above are,  however,
because  of  their  simple  origin,  the  basic  ones.  The  results  may  seem  rather
trivial  when  a  diagonalized  matrix  is  considered,  but  formulae  (2.13)  are
independent of matrix basis.  Some deep consequences can be found,  related  to
the detailed algebraic structure  of  the Lie  algebra.  For  example, a semisimple
algebra  is  the  direct  product  of  simple  sub-algebras  and  its  characteristic
polynomial  is  always  of  the  form  D (l )  =  P
kD k(l ),  where  the  D k’s  are  the
characteristic polynomials of the simple subalgebras.

. If  g  is a group  element, this means that gT h  g  =  h

Orthogonal  or  pseudo-orthogonal  groups  are  usually  introduced  as
groups  of  real  transformations  which  preserve  a  real  bilinear  non-singular
form  h
, where  gT  is  the
transposed matrix. If g  =  exp[A], with  A a member  of  the group  Lie  algebra,
then this implies AT =  -  h Ah
-1 and the traces  of  the odd powers  of  A vanish.
Actually, the odd coefficients in the characteristic polynomial (that is,  the odd-
order invariants) vanish. The argument is the following. Take z = - 1 in (2.9),

det[l I-A]= (cid:229)

j

(-)jl N-j
j!

N

 
j=0

m=0

 Bjm{(-)k-1(k-1)!tr(Ak)} .

(2.17)

The  determinant  for  the  transposed  matrix  must  be  the  same:  det[l I-A]  =
det[l I-AT]. As AT = - h Ah
-1, a sign factor (-)k appears in the arguments of the
Bell polynomials: Bjm{(-)k-1(k-1)!tr[(AT)k]} = Bjm{(-)k(-)k-1(k-1)!tr(Ak)} = (-)j
Bjm{(-)k-1(k-1)!tr(Ak)} by (2.7). Consequently, we have also

 det[l I-A] = (cid:229)

j

l N-j
j!

N

 
j=0

m=0

 Bjm{(-)k-1(k-1)!tr(Ak)}.

Comparison with (2.17) shows that the coefficients must vanish for  odd values
of j: j 2p+1(w

) = 0. The invariants of (2.13) reduce to simpler forms, like

j o(w

) = 1; j 1(w

) = 0; j 2(w

) = -  

   trA2; j 3(w

For  unitary  groups  written  in  terms  of  hermitian  generators,  AT  =  A*,  the
only  conclusion  is  that  the  invariants  are  real,  j
).  The  extra
condition det [g = exp[iA]] = 1 for special unitary groups leads, of course, to tr
A = 0.

The rank of the Lie algebra being the number of  independent invariants,
the higher the rank the more multilinear forms there will  be.  The  Lorentz  and
the Poincaré  groups  are  of  rank  2  and  have  bilinear  and  quadrilinear  forms.
Another rank 2 case is the group SU(3) of special unitary  3· 3 matrices,  which
has a bilinear and a trilinear invariant. Let  us use this group  to  illustrate  some
of the above results.  In  terms  of  parameters  a
k,  k  =  1,  2,  .  .  .,  8},  and
using the Gell-Mann basis {Tk} for the algebra (Lee, 1981), the group  element
is

Applying the secular equation to  the matrix,    W3 -

Let us begin by  saying a few words  on  functions of  matrices  in  general
(Gantmacher,  1990).  Suppose a complex function  F(l )  is given  which  can  be

expanded as a power series F(l ) = (cid:229)

 ck(l - l

eigenvalues  of  A  lie  within  the  convergence  circle.  In  particular, 
exponential is always well defined.

Given  an  N· N  matrix  A  of  eigenvalues  l 1,  l 2,  .  .  .  ,  l N,  the  set  of

The  Zj's  have  remarkable  properties.  Besides  being  projectors  (that  is,
idempotents, Z2
j =  Zj),  they can be normalized  so  that  tr  (Zj)  =  1  for  each  j
(for  a general  idempotent Z,  tr  Z  =  rank  Z  is  the  dimension  of  the  subspace
into which it projects). They are then  orthonormal  by  the trace,  tr(ZiZj)  =  d

What we have done is to start from a basis {Ak} for the functions of A, and go
to the projector basis. Actually, any set of independent polynomials in  A could
be used as the starting  basis. Their  use can  prove  necessary  to  avoid  that  the
above determinant  vanish identically.  Thus,  once we know the  projectors,  we
can use them as the basis polynomials in A and the above determinant becomes

which is clearly the same as (3.2).

To obtain the closed expressions of the projectors in  terms  of  powers  of
A and the invariants, we need some results on symmetric functions, of  which a
brief  account  is  given  in  the  appendix.  The  expression  (3.5)  is  actually  the
ratio  of  two  generating  functions  of  the  so-called  elementary  symmetric
functions of the “alphabet” {l
N} with  one missing letter.  The
detailed  calculation  is  also  shown  in  the  appendix  and  gives  each  projector
(3.5) in terms of the invariants (2.13):

(3.9)

The  reader  may  have  qualms  about  the  case  where  some  root  l
0  =  0.
The  good rule  is to  perform  first  the  computation  of  the  projectors  with  the
symbols  l
k,  without  putting  in  the  values,  and  then  multiply  numerator  and
denominator  by  det  A  =  P
k.  This  procedure  will  dispose  of  any  problem
with  eventual  vanishing  eigenvalues.  The  closed  expressions  (3.9)  are  more
useful for larger matrices. For small ones they can, however,  be used to  check
the results  obtained by  direct  computation.  We  have  found  them  very  useful
while  checking  the  calculations  presented  below  with  the  Mathematica™
software system.

k

When the  matrix  A  is  a  member  of  a  Lie  algebra,  we  have  a  curious
problem,  touching Galois theory.  As we saw in  the section 2,  the  coefficients
of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix A are written in terms of invariant
polynomials and the roots  l
i.  Suppose  we  are  able  to  solve  the  characteristic
polynomial. This means that we can write  the  l
i's  in  terms  of  the polynomials
coefficients, that is, of the invariants. In this case, the coefficient of each A k in
(3.9) is an invariant. Notice, however, our basic assumption: we should be able

to solve the polynomial. Fortunately,  this will  be the case for  the Lie  algebras
of groups of physical interest examined in the following. This is not the case in
general for N ‡

 5.

In  plain  sight  expressions  like  (3.5)  become  undefined  when  two  or
more  eigenvalues  coincide.  This  formulation  works  only  for  nondegenerate
matrices.  The  method  will  consequently  only  apply  for  Lie  algebras  whose
generic elements have no  degenerate  eigenvalues. This  happens for  the SU(3),
Lorentz and Poincaré cases, but not for the Galilei generic algebra element.

The  general  expressions  in  the  presence  of  degenerate  eigenvalues  are
rather involved.  We shall only  present  a mnemonic rule,  addressing the more
interested  reader  to  a  complete  reference  (Gantmacher,  1990).  For  that  it  is
better  to  look  back at (3.7).  Suppose that the eigenvalues are  degenerate:  that
n1  of  the  roots  are  equal  to  l
1,  n2  of  the  roots  are  l n1+1,  and  so  on.  The
determinant becomes, of course, identically null, and the equation gives no real
information. We have to correct it. The rule is  then the following:  (i)  the first
column remains  as it  is; (ii)  the  second,  headed  by  F(l
1),  also;  (iii)  the  next
(n1-1) columns are  replaced  by  the successive derivatives  of  order  1,  2,  .  .  .  ,
(n1-1)  of  F(l
1);  (iv)  then comes the column headed by  F(l n1+1); (v)  the  next
(n2-1)  columns  are  the  derivatives  of  that  column,  up  to  that  headed  by
F(n1+n2-1)(l n1+1); and so on for all the columns. Notice that we first derive  the
formal  expressions  and  only  after  put  in  the  exact  values  of  the  roots.  The
general aspect of the formal determinantal equation becomes

We shall illustrate it later with the Galilei group. Also here it may happen that,
for  a  certain  choice  of  the  monomials  in  the  first  column,  the  determinant
vanishes identically. In  this  case,  we  must  replace  the  monomials  by  another
collection (eventually of polynomials), in order to have a nontrivial equation.

4.  CHARACTERISTIC  CLASSES

Perhaps  the  most  beautiful  examples  of  the  invariants  described  above
are the differential forms  describing  the characteristic  classes of  fiber  bundles
on  even-dimensional  differentiable  manifolds  (Kobayashi  and  Nomizu  l963).
These eminently  mathematical  objects  are  of  great  interest  in  gauge  theories
and have received  a lot  of  attention of  physicists (Eguchi,  Gilkey  and  Hanson
1980; Zumino 1985). We  shall only  consider  briefly  their  formal  aspects, and
confine ourselves to Chern classes. There are actually two interrelated kinds of
classes  going  under  Chern’s  name:  the  Chern  classes  proper  and  the  Chern
characters  (Nakahara  1990).  We  shall  find  easily  the  closed,  complete
expressions  of  their  interrelations.  Consider  the  complex  linear  group
GL(N,C) of all invertible N· N matrices with  complex entries  and let A be an
element  of  its  Lie  algebra  G’L(N,C).  To  conform  to  current  mathematical
notation  it  is  enough  to  take  formula  (2.9)  with  z  =  i
2p   ,  so  that  now  the
invariant polynomial functions are

k[A] = (

(4.1)

Given a complex vector bundle E over a manifold M with typical fiber  CN and
associated  to  a  principal  bundle  P,  the  k-th  Chern  class  ck(E)  will  be
characterized by a closed differential form ck of degree 2k on M.  This  form  is
that  (unique)  form  whose  pull-back  is  j
  is  the
curvature  of  a  connection  G
classes  represented  by  the  ck's  are  shown  to  be  independent  of  G
consequently, related  to  the more  basic, topological features  of  the  bundle.  If
 M is the bundle projection and p * the corresponding pull-back,

Notice  that  here  N  is  the  fiber  dimension.  These  relations  are  simple
adaptations of (2.13). For orthogonal groups, the  first  invariants  reduce  to  the
simpler forms of (2.18),

co(E) = 1; c1(E) = 0; c2(E) =  

   trF2; c3(E) = 0;

Handling matrices  of  forms  in  general  requires  some attention,  because
the  non-commutativity  of  forms  is  added  to  that  of  matrices.  Here  only  2-
forms appear, which are commutative. Of  course,  the higher-order  classes are
of  limited  physical  interest,  as  products  of  forms  vanish  when  the  resulting
degree  surpasses  the  space  dimension.  On  4-dimensional  spacetime,  only
invariant polynomials up to j
4  are non-vanishing.

for j,k ‡ 0, mere reflections of (A.6) and (A.7):

cj(E) =  

  Bjm {(-)k-1 (k-1)! k! chk(E)};

(4.7)

 k! chk(E) =   

 (-)j-1(j-1)!  Bkj  {r!cr(E)}.

(4.8)

Our  concern  here  is  simply  to  exhibit  these  closed  expressions  for  the
relationships.  We  have  only  considered  the  complex  linear  groups.  The
interested  reader  will  find  in  the  quoted  references  details  on  Pontryagin
classes g2k(F) = (-)kf2k(F), Euler classes, etc.

The relations (4.3) are,  as said, simple adaptations of  (2.13)  and lead to
the introduction of  multilinear  objects like (2.14),  which are  invariant  tensors
and allow to obtain more general invariants.  The  usual Lagrangian  density for
gauge fields, for example, is the invariant  tr F˜F  =  g
ab is the
Killing  form  and  ˜F   is the dual of  F  in  Minkowski  space.  The  corresponding
Chern  class,  c2(E),  would  be  a  "topological  Lagrangian  density".  Current
gauge theories  use groups  for  which tr  F  =  0,  so  that  only  the  term  in  tr  F2
appear in  the Lagrangian.  A gauge theory  for  the linear  group  GL(4,  R),  for
example,  could  have  (Aldrovandi  and  Stedile,  1984)  an  extra  term  in
(trF)(tr  ˜F).

We now apply  the  Z-method  to  some  cases  of  special  importance.  We

shall, as a rule, use anti-hermitian generators in what follows.

Z1 =  

(A + U)(A 2 - V2)

We should be  attentive  to  the  limit  cases,  as  the  simple  version  of  the
method  given  here  could  fail  if  some  eigenvalues  become  identical.  It  is
enough to be careful. In the  limit  towards  the identity,  we find  that for  U and
V small,  the  terms  behave  as  they  should:  the  diagonal  terms  as  L
  1  +
z 2/2; L
 1  +  (L11  -  w
1);
etc.  We find  just pure  rotation  for  z
  =  0,  and  the  usual  expression  (Jackson,
1975) for a general pure boost when  w

6.  POINCARÉ  TRANSFORMATIONS

The inhomogeneous Lorentz transformation  will  have much in  common
with  the  homogeneous  Lorentz  case,  but  also  some  significant  differences,
in  the  characteristic
stemming  mainly  from  an  extra  (vanishing)  root 
polynomial.  In  terms  of  the  rotation  w
,  space  translation
parameters  a =  (a1,a2,a3) and time  translation  parameter  a0,  the  basic  algebra
element will be

The  characteristic  polynomial  will  have  two  vanishing  coefficients  and

can be conveniently written in the form

l 5 + f1 l 3 - f2

2 l

 = 0,

(6.2)

which should be compared to (5.4). The two invariants are  f1 =  w
=  w
same, just those of (5.6,7):

2  -  z 2 and f2
  ,  the  same  as  for  the  Lorentz  case.  Of  the  roots,  four  are  also  the

There is, however an extra root,

0 = 0.

In terms of the eigenprojectors, the general group element will be

g = e0 Z0 + eU Z1 + e-U Z2 + eV Z3 + e-V Z4 =

= Z0 + sinhU(Z1 - Z2) + coshU(Z1 + Z2) + sinhV(Z3 - Z4) + coshV(Z3 + Z4).
(6.5)

Taking  into  account  the  relationships  between  the  roots  and  choosing
convenient denominators, the projectors become

Z0 = I +

Computation of  the generic  Poincaré  group  matrix  element now can be
made from  (6.7).  Direct  calculation yields the rather  awkward  general  form.
We can, however,  use identities such as U2+V2= -  f1 and U2V2 =  -f2
2, as well
as the definitions of  the various  vectors,  to  get  simpler  expressions.  We  find
identities like (U2+V2)z
    +  D =  -  X;
V2w
 - C = W  - f1
    -  Z;  etc.  There  are,  so,  many different
though  equivalent  expressions  for  the  entries.  One  of  the  simplest  is  the
following:
gab = d

The entries  in  common are  exactly those in  (5.15).  And here  we arrive
at  a  limitation  of  the  method.  Proceeding  as  described,  we  do  obtain  the
generic group element as  the exponential of  the generic  algebra    member,  but
the  result  is  very  complicated.  The  (space  and  time)  translation  parameters
appear  mixed  in  a  very  cumbersome  way.  A  detailed  examination  of  the
Galilei case shows the reason for that.  There,  direct  exponentiation is feasible,

transformations.  The  result 

and the study of the order-by-order effects of  one transformation  on  the other
shows how, at each order, the parameters of one transformation is modified by
the  other 
is  not  interesting,  as  the  usual
parametrizations  are  much simpler.  Recall that  there  are  two  possible  simple
parametrizations  for  semidirect  products  like  the  Euclidean  and  the  Poincaré
groups. This is due to the fact that a general transformation is  the product  of  a
rotation (in 3-space or in  spacetime, respectively)  by  a translation  (idem),  and
that this product can be chosen to be done in the inverse order, a translation by
a rotation.  An inhomogeneous Lorentz  transformation  P  =  (L,a)  can be given
either  by  x'  =  L(x+a)  or  by  x'  =  Lx+a.  In  the  first  case  translations  are
performed first and the homogeneous Lorentz transformations  will  act also on
them. The latter is the more usual parametrization,

which is, in this particular aspect, simpler.

7.  THE  GALILEI  GROUP

The  application  of  the  method  of  matrix  functions  is,  for  the  Galilei
group, far more complicated: the matrix  representing  the algebra  member  has
coincident  eigenvalues.  With  the  rotation  angles  collected  as  above  in  the
vector w

and time translation parameter a0, the generic member of the Galilei algebra is

Z4   and Z5 are  real  projectors,  idempotents  and  annihilating  each  other.  But
Z10, Z11 and  Z12 are  not.  They  do  satisfy the relations  Z4 Z10 =  0;  Z5Z10  =  0;
2 = Z10; and Z10  +  Z4  +  Z5 =  I.  But they fail  to  satisfy the other  necessary
Z10
relations  to  be  projectors.  Thus,  for  example,  Z10Z11  =  Z11;  Z10Z12    =  Z12;
Z11Z12 = 0; Z12

The effect of exponentiation is analogous to that we have found in the Poincaré
case: the translation and velocity parameters  we started  with  get all mixed up.
Another  way to  obtain the expressions for  the Galilei group  is  by  the  Inönü-
Wigner contraction  (Gilmore,  1974))  of  the Poincaré  result.  This  would need
a previous preparation of the matrices, with some extra factors of  c and 1/c.  It
is  simpler  to  start  from  another  parametrization  of  the  Poincaré  algebra
element: instead of (6.1), we take A changed by  a similarity  transformation,  S
A S-1, with  S = diag(1,c,c,c,1):

A =

This  corresponds  to  dividing  the  entries  (0k)  of  A  by  c  and  multiplying  the
entries  (k0)  by  c.  All  the powers  of  A and the  exponential  itself  will  acquire
the same factors in the corresponding  entries.  The  result  for  the Galilei group
comes by taking the limit c ﬁ
 ¥
 though, as usual in the contraction procedure,
the translation parameters must absorb a factor "c" in the limit.

8.  FINAL  COMMENTS

To  arrive  at the exponentials we could use directly  equations  (3.3)  and
(3.5)  and  ignore  the  treatment  involving  the  characteristic  polynomial  and
symmetric functions, leading to the closed expressions for  the projectors.  That
discussion  provides,  however,  a  deeper  insight  into  the  whole  subject,  in
particular showing how the generalized boost and rotation angles are invariant.
The  method  requires  the    knowledge  of  the  roots  of  the  characteristic
polynomial.  The  approach  also throws  a bridge  towards  the tantalizing recent

results  on  the  relationship  between  invariant  polynomials  and  von  Neumann
algebras (Jones,1991). We have taken as granted  that functions of  matrices,  as
long  as they can be defined,  are  completely determined  by  their  spectra.  This
is  justified  in  a  much  more  general  context.  Matrix  algebras  are  very
particular kinds of von Neumann  algebras  and it  is a very  strong  result  of  the
theory  of  Banach  algebras  (Kirillov,  1974;  Bratelli  and  Robinson,1979)  that
functions on such spaces, as long as defined, are indeed fixed by the spectra.

SYMMETRIC  FUNCTIONS

A symmetric function (Littlewood,  1950;  Comtet,  1974;  MacDonald, 1979)  in
N variables x1, x2, x3, . . . , xN is a polynomial F(x1, x2, x3, .  .  .  ,  xN) which is
invariant under any permutation of the xk's. Their main properties are listed in
appendix A.  The  variables  may be called “letters”  and we  shall  indicate  them
collectively  by  x.  This  set  x  =  {x1,  x2,  x3,  .  .  .  ,  xN}  is  called,  naturally
enough, the "alphabet" and a monomial is a “word”.  A symmetric  function  in
N variables F(x1, x2, x3, . . . , xN) i F(x) can be written as sum of words,

F(x) = S {n1,n2,n3,...},{i1,i2,i3,...,iN}xi1

(A.1)

Only two kinds of such functions will interest us:

(i)  the j-th  elementary  symmetric  function    s
with j distinct letters:

j,  the  sum  of  all  distinct  words

j[x] = S

(N) x1x2 . . . xj.

(A.2)

As examples,

1[x] = x1+ x2 + x3 + . . . + xN ;

2[x] = x1x2+ x1x3 + ... + x1xN  + ... + x2x3 + x2x4  + ... + ... + xN-1xN;

 . . .

N[x] = x1x2x3  . . .  xN-1xN .
When the xj's are the eigenvalues of an N· N matrix A, clearly s

N[x] = detA.

(ii) the k-th power-sum symmetric function

k  = (x1)k+ (x2)k + (x3)k + . . . + (xN)k

  .

(A.3)

When the xj's are  the eigenvalues of  A,  sk[x] is clearly  the trace  of  Ak. These
symmetric functions have the generating functions  

and

with  s
0  =  1  by  convention.  The  so  called  fundamental  theorem  of  the
symmetric  functions  says  that  the  s k's  are  algebraically  independent.  This
means that, up to a constant, and for  N ﬁ
, a general  formal  series f(t)  can
be  seen  as  the  generating  function  P([x],  t)  with  a  convenient  choice  of  the
alphabet  x.  There  are  two  relationships  (offsprings  of  the  obvious  relation

 ¥

([x], t)  =  - 

    ln  P([x],  -  t)),  inverse  to  each  other,  between  the  functions

(A.8)

With  (A.7),  we  have  so  to  say  completed  a  circle:  the  sn[x]'s  are  just  the
original  powers  of  traces.  It  is  interesting  to  consider  simultaneously  two
related  alphabets.  Take  x  =  {x1,  x2,  x3,  .  .  .  ,  xN}  as  above  and  call  its
"reciprocal" the alphabet  x*  =  {x*1, x*2, x*3, .  .  .  ,  xN*},  where  each x*j =  -
1/xj. Notice that x**k = xk. The s

k's of these alphabets are related by

In  the  above  expressions,  the  highest-order  coefficient  is  b0  =  1  and  the

the coefficients and the roots of a polynomial comes out immediately:

br = (-)rs

 Brm{(-)k-1(k-1)!sk[x]}.

of  non-commutative  variables  (Gelfand  1994,  1995)  have  called  attention  to
the interest of having closed forms like those above, even for the classical case.
Let now s
ji[x] be the sum of all j-products of the alphabet x,  but  excluding the
letter  xi.  For  example, s Ni[x] = (cid:213)

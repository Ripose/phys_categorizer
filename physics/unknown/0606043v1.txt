Abstract 

The website network of a tourism destination is examined. The main statistical characteristics of the 

underlying  graph  are  calculated.  The  topology  of  the  network  is  similar  to  the  one  characterizing 

similar  systems.  However,  some  differences  are  found,  mainly  due  to  the  relatively  poor 

connectivity among the vertices of the network.

1.  Introduction 

destination. 

The vast catalogue of studies on complex networks which has been compiled in the last few years is 

missing an important component: the tourism industry (see the reviews [1] [2] [3] [4]). This paper 

aims  at  filling  this  gap  and  presenting  an  investigation  on  the  websites  network  of  a  tourism 

In the second part of last century, tourism has become probably the largest economic sector of the 

1

World economy. In broad terms, according to the last estimates of the World Travel and Tourism 

Council [5], it is expected to total 10.6% of GDP and more than 200 million jobs. And the growth is 

thought to continue for the next years at a rate close to 5% per year. 

The  boundaries  of  the  tourism  and  travel  industry  are  fairly  indefinite.  It  brings  together,  and 

strongly influences, segments from a number of different activities with a wide variety of products 

and services exhibiting very little homogeneity. 

There is probably no other economic sector with such a diversity and this has raised the question of 

whether tourism and travel should even be classified as an industry by itself, in the traditional sense 

of manufacturing or trade. 

In the last decade, then, tourism has become an extremely dynamic system [6]. In the last years, the 

globalisation  enabled  by  technology  development  and  by  less  expensive  travel  costs  has  greatly 

increased  competition.  The  intensified  marketing  efforts  of  all  tourism  organisations  has  led  to  a 

more effective approach: the destination management approach [7]. 

The  spectrum  of  definitions  describing  a  destination  is  extremely  broad,  and  there  are  many 

difficulties in setting clear boundaries to a Tourism Destination (TD). In general, every place for a 

holiday, every place to visit may be considered a destination. In broad terms, a tourism destination 

may be intended as a geographical area that offers the tourist the opportunity of exploiting a variety 

of attractions and services [8]. 

The  supply  is  provided  by  a  more  or  less  definite  set  of  private  and  public  organizations  and 

companies that, in the ideal case, collaborate and coordinate their efforts in order to maximize their 

profits  and  to  assure  a  balanced  and  sustainable  progress  of  the  local  resources,  avoiding  any 

possible threat to people and environment [9].  

Apart from the definition problems, a TD is the archetype of a complex adaptive system (CAS). It 

shares  many  (if  not  all)  of  the  characteristics  usually  associated  with  a  CAS:  non-linear 

relationships  among  the  system  components,  self-organization  of  the  structures,  robustness  to 

external shocks [10]. 

The  intangibility  of  a  tourism  product  stresses  its  information  component  so  that  it  is  always 

described as an “information intensive” one [11]. Therefore it is not surprising that the relationship 

between tourism and information technology is very strict. This sort of genetic tie originates at the 

dawn of the electronic  computer  history, at the end of the  1960s with the  deployment of the first 

computerized  reservation  systems.  The  evolution  of  the  two  industries  has  almost  always  been 

parallel  and,  not  unexpectedly,  the  Internet  sees  in  travel  and  tourism  organizations  its  most 

numerous and important component.

The Internet age has allowed the development of new ways for producing and distributing tourism 

services. Web-based approaches and technologies are helping tourism suppliers and agencies reduce 

service costs and attract customers [9]. A website looks to be a major (and, probably, it will be the 

only one in the future) tool to conduct business in the tourism field. According to PhoCusWright’s  

estimates [12], for example, online sales in the U.S. will be 35% of the travel market in 2005 and 

more than 50% in 2006.  

2.  The web space of a tourism destination 

The websites of a tourism destination have been analyzed. The destination is the island of Elba, off 

the  coast  of  Tuscany,  Italy,  in  the  heart  of  the  western  Mediterranean  Sea.  It  is  an  important 

environmental resource; its geographic position, temperate climate, and the variety and beauty of its 

landscapes, coast and sea, make it a tourist destination famous all over the world.  

As  for  many  other  destinations,  the  Web  has  become,  in  the  last  years,  an  important  means  of 

promotion and of commercialization for the whole community of  local tourism operators. 

The  elements  of  the  network  examined  are  the  websites  belonging  to  the  “classical”  tourism 

operators:  accommodation  (hotels,  residences,  camping  sites  etc.),  intermediaries  (travel  agencies 

and tour operators), transport, regulation bodies, services etc. The whole size of the network is not 

huge,  it  comprises  468  elements,  but  of  a  size  which  can  be  considered  sufficient  to  show 

meaningfully the graph’s statistical properties [2] [13].  

The  websites  have  been  analyzed  considering  them  as  the  nodes  of  a  complex  network.  Links 

among the websites have been counted by using a simple crawler, complementing the data obtained 

with a visual inspection of the websites. Besides that, links connecting the Elban websites, in both 

directions,  to  the  rest  of  the  Web  have  been  identified.  In  what  follows  an  Elban  website  is  one 

belonging  to  a  tourism  operator  based  on  Elba  island,  E  denotes  the  graph  defined  by  the  edges 

connecting only Elban  websites, W  is  the set of links between Elban websites and the rest of the 

World Wide Web. 

All  links  are  considered  of  directed  nature.  Figure  1  (drawn  with  Pajek  [14])  gives  a  graphical 

representation of the E network thus obtained. 

<< Figure 1 >> 

3.  The results of the statistical analysis 

The E network is rather sparse, its link density is d = 0.002 and almost 21% of the websites have no 

connection whatsoever with other sites. The diameter is D = 11, the average distance L =  4.5 and 

 

3

the global clustering coefficient C = 0.003.  

<< Figure 2 >> 

<< Figure 3 >> 

<<Table 1 >> 

Key  parameters  characterizing  the  structure  of  a  directed  network  are  the  in-degree  (kin)  and 

out-degree (kout) distributions. Both the E and W networks, as depicted in fig. 2 and 3, display an 
almost perfect power law decay P(k) ~ k-γ. The cumulative degree distributions are shown in Figure 

2 and Figure 3. The exponents calculated for the networks are listed in table 1 

All  the  exponents  (with  the  exception  of  γin  for  the  E  network)  are  lower  than  those  typically 

measured  for  the  Web  (γin  ~  2.1  and  γout  ~  2.7  [15])  showing  thus  a  more  skewed  and  “sparse” 

distribution which may be seen as a very low propensity to reference the external world.. 

A spectral analysis confirms the main topological characteristics of the E network.  

The  shape  of  the  spectral  density  ρ(κ)  of  a  graph  is  known  to  be  an  indicator  of  the  topological 

properties  of  a  network  [16]  [17].  For  random  graphs  with  a  giant  connected  component  it 

converges to a semicircle following Wigner’s law [18]. All other cases see different distributions: a 

highly skewed multipeaked structure for a small-world network and a triangular shape for scale-free 

graphs. As Figure 4a shows, the power law behaviour of the degree distribution for the E network is 

evident. 

The  ρ(λ)  spectral  distribution  of  the  Laplacian  matrix  associated  to  the  E  network  is  shown  in 

Figure  4b.  It  can  be  noted  that  a  high  number  of  the  Laplacian  eigenvalues  are  null.  This  is  an 

indication [19] of the scarce connectedness of the network. The multiplicity of the null eigenvalue, 

in fact, corresponds to the number of the connected components of the network. 

The  general  topological  properties  of  the  World  Wide  Web  have  been  studied  by  a  number  of 

authors. In particular, it has been possible to highlight a complex structure of its components (web 

pages or websites). According to Broder et al. [20] the structure has a bow-tie shape, in which it is 

possible  to  recognise  a  number  of  components  characterised  by  their  connectivity  characteristics. 

The  model,  widely  accepted,  sees  a  strongly  connected  component  (SCC),  formed  by  all  pages 

mutually connected by a directed link, an in-component (IN) and an out-component (OUT), formed 

by nodes connected to the SCC in a monodirectional way plus a series of secondary structures such 

as TENDRILS, containing pages that cannot reach the SCC and cannot be reached from it, TUBES,  

directly linking the IN and OUT parts without crossing the SCC and some disconnected elements 

(DCC), similar to isolated islands, with no connection at all to the other components. 

This structure has also been identified in several subnetworks of the whole Web, thus confirming 

 

4

the hypothesis of a self-similar configuration for the Web [21]. 

The Elban websites network, besides the general low connectivity among its websites, still exhibits 

a  bow-tie  structure.  Table  2  displays  the  estimated  proportions  for  the  bow-tie  components  along 

with the values accepted for the whole Web. 

<< Table 2 >> 

Local and global efficiency [22] are: Eloc = 0.0145 and Eglob =  0.16981. These values are sensibly 

lower  than  those  found  for  similar  systems.  The  local  efficiency  value  confirms  the  poor 

clusterisation of the network.  

If we think of the efficiency as a measure of how well information is exchanged over the network 

[22], both at a local and at a global scale, this result induces some apprehension with regard to the 

capability of achieving an effective cooperation among the various elements of the tourism network. 

Thinking of a web  space as a virtual counterpart of an important economic and social  system, an 

interesting quantity to measure is the assortativity coefficient. Many other social networks studied 

so far are characterized by assortative mixing, i.e. the edges preferably connect vertices with similar 

degrees, and this is usually interpreted as a sign of collaboration among the actors of the network 

[3] [23] [24] [25]. The coefficient can be calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient between 

the degrees of adjacent vertices in the network [24]. For the Elban websites network (E network) 

the coefficient is: -0.101 ± 0.094 (standard error is computed as in [24]). This quite low value can 

be seen, again, as an index of a certain reluctance to form collaborative groups among the tourism 

operators  (at  least  on  the  web),  fact  that  can  also  be  confirmed  by  the  relatively  poor  general 

connectivity of the system.  

4.  Summary 

The network formed by the websites of a tourism destination has been analysed, as part of a larger 

project on the structure of the relationships existing among the stakeholders of such systems. The 

statistical mechanics tools developed in the last years for this purpose [4] have been used to derive 

the main topological characteristics of this network. 

The results show a general agreement with similar results [20] [21] [26] [27], obtained by studying 

the Web and websites configurations. This may reinforce the idea of a substantial self-similarity in 

the  structure  of  the  Web  space  [21].  Some  of  the  values,  though,  show  different  characteristics:  

basically a lower connectivity and a higher sparseness.  

It is difficult to explain these differences as the history of the system’s evolution is not known.  

Nevertheless,  if  we  accept  the  idea  that,  given  the  wide-reaching  diffusion  of  the  Internet,  a  web 

 

5

network  is  a  close  representation  of  the  social  network  formed  by  the  publishers  of  the  websites  

[28], then we see in the results presented here a faithful representation of the relationships among 

the actors of a typical tourism destination. The fragmented nature of  the tourism industry, for the 

diversity  of  activities  and  organisations  involved,  is  one  of  its  natural  traits  [29],  and  the  lack  of 

cooperation  among  the  actors  of  these  networks  is  equally  well  known.  On  the  other  hand,  this 

much sought-after capacity to team up is considered to be an important element for the success of a 

destination [30].  

The  outcomes  presented  here  show  how  the  statistical  analysis  of  networks  can  render  quite 

faithfully the structure of a peculiar social network. This is, at author’s knowledge, one of the very 

first  attempts  to  use  these  techniques  in  this  field.  Further  work  is  under  way  to  explain  the 

dynamical evolution of a tourism system and to relate it with the methods traditionally used for its  

analysis.  Moreover,  the  application  of  simulation  algorithms  can  suggest  modifications  to  the 

structure of the network in order to optimise its features and behaviours.

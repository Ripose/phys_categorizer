Abstract 
Fractal  behavior  and  long-range  dependence  have  been  observed  in 
tele-traffic measurement  and characterization.  In this paper we show 
results  of  application  of  the  fractal  analysis  to  internet  traffic  via 
various  methods.    Our  result  demonstrate  that  the  internet  traffic 
exhibits self-similarity,  and giving the spectral exponent (β : 1 < β < 
2).    Our  analysis  showed  that  Holder  exponent  (H  :    0<  H  <  0.5)  ,  
fractal dimensions (D :  1 < D < 2) and the correlation coefficients are 
(ρ : –1/2 < ρ < 0).  Time-scale analysis show to be an effective way to 
characterize  the  local  irregularity.   Based on the result of this study, 
these two Internet time series exhibit fractal characteristic with long-
range dependence.  

 
 

I.  Introduction 

Fractal  behavior  and  long-range  dependence  have  been  observed  in  many 

phenomena,  basically  in  the  field  of  fluctuations  in  physical  systems  such  as 

diffusion[1,4,6,13,15,17],  financial  time  series[7],  tele-traffic[13,16,17,18,19]  and  time 

series of heart rate dynamic[10,17] and human gait[10].  In this paper, we characterize 

the dynamics of  internet traffic time series.  We applied fractal analysis into the internet 

traffic time series via various methods, such as power-spectral analysis(PSA), detrended 

fluctuation analysis(DFA) and time-scale analysis(TSA). 

Data to be analyzed are document sizes which are transferred through Library Of 

Congress (LOC) WWW  server.  Two types of Internet traffic, namely LOC(request) and 

LOC(send)  are  examined  in  this  paper.    LOC(request)  is  the  time  series  of document 

sizes which transferred into the server where LOC(send) is the time series of document 

sizes which transferred out from the sever.  These internet traffic time series are plays an 

important role in determining the degree of smooth ascessing via a particular server. 

The presence of “burstiness” across an extremely wide range of time scale in both 

the time series showed that both of  these internet traffic time series are different from 

conventinoal  model  for  telephone  traffic,  i.e..  pure  Poisson  or  Poisson-related  formal 

model for packet traffic[14,16,18,19].

Some Properties of Fractal 

Fractal  characterises  the  object  or  process  by  using  a  fractional  geometry  or 

simplify  Fractal  geometry,  D.    A  fractal  object  can  be  characterize  by  a  dimension 

between two integers, i.e.. D = 1.5 .  Fractal have following two important properties;.. 

(a) 

Self-similarity  or  self-affine.    A  Fractal  object  similar  with  other  part  even  for 

different scales.  This porperty namely scale-invariance which fractal object will similar 

in all possible scales.  Self-smilar exist when the object show similarity under isotropic 

scaling,  meanwhile  self-affine exist  when object show  similarity under  an inisotropics 

(b) 

Self-similar  hierarchy  structure  under  magnatification.    A  fractal  object  consist 

complex inner structure and show similar geometry even under different magnatification

scale.[15]. 

Due to the scale invariance, a power-law behavior exist in between two parameters in a  

fractal phenomenon , like

                                                                                           (1) 

where f(x) is a function of a study object and c is a constant.  From the example given by 

[20], onne can estimate the fractal dimension through this power-law behavior.

Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) 

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been widely used to determine mono-

fractal scaling properties and long-range dependence in noisy, nonstationary time series.  

DFA is used to estimate the root-mean-square fluctuation of an integrated and detrented 

time  series  (a  modified  root-mean-square  analysis  of  random  walk),  and  had  the 

capability  of  detection  of  long  range  dependence.  The  mathematical  form  of  the 

integrated time series Y(i) is denoted as [5],

     i = 1,…..,N.

where xk  is k-sequence of  the  time  series,  and  x   is the  average of the time series of 

length N.  

 

Next, Y(i) is deviated into Ns ≡ int(N/s) non-overlapping segments of equal length 

s as shown in Fig. 2. Since, the length of the time series is often not a multiple of time 

scale s, a short part at the end of the integrated time series may remain. To overcome this 

problem, the same procedure is repeated starting from the opposite end, and the remain 

part of the time series is analyzed too. Therefore, the total segments are 2Ns. After the 

integrated  time  series  is deviated into  Ns  segments, which each segment has the  same 

equal length s, a least-square best fit line is fitted onto the time series to obtain the local 

trend in that particular segment as shown in Fig.2.

segment v.

series to obtain the fluctuation function that given as

F(s) will increase with increasing s, and it is only defined for the segment length, 

s  ≥  4.    A  log-log  plot  of  F(s)  versus  s  need to  be to  determine  the scaling behaviors. 

Therefore, the above steps are repeated several times to obtain a set data of F(s) versus s 

 

 

as shown in Fig.3. The slope of the curve shows the scaling exponent α, if the time series 

are long-range power-law correlated. Hence, F(s) and s can be related with a power-law 

relation which is given as 
F(s) ∼ sα,

signals, which are Brownian motion, persistence power-law, and anti-persistence power-

law process with Holder exponent of H = 0.50, H = 0.80, and H = 0.20 respectively. The

It can be noticed that scaling exponent α of these two signals are identical with 

each others, which α change from white noise (s ≤ 60) to 1/f process (s ≤ 400), and then, 

to a process with α ≈ 2.00, finally.

Time-Scale Analysis (TSA) 

The previous described methods are based on linear log-log plot which give only 

a  single  value  of  the  H,  these  methods  are  found  to  be  insufficient   in  estimating  the 

locally time-varying Holder exponent, H(t).  The wavelet approach were a powerful tool 

to solve this problem.  The wavelet transform (WT) is a tool which can be function as a 

mathematical microscope that can well adapted to reveal the hierarchy and governs the 

spatial  distribution of  the singularities of multifractal measures.  We only consider the 

continuous wavelet transform (CWT) in time-scale analysis in order to estimate the H(t). 

The CWT are defined as

VI.  Discussion 

From  the  analysis  results,  these  two  internet  traffic  time  series  exhibit  fractal 

characteristics with long-range dependence. Therefore a previous increment of the time 

series  will  affect  the  future  increment,  and  exist  a  long-range  memory  in  these  two 

internet traffic time series.  For the DFA results, show that LOC(request) and LOC(send) 

time  series  exhibit  crossover  phenomenon  within  different  segment  length  s.  This  is 

probably due to the fact that on very short times scale (starting time of requesting and 

sending  files),  the  internet  traffic  time  series  is  dominated  by  highly  uncorrelated 

fluctuation process. As the time goes on, these signals exhibit smoother fluctuation that 

reflect  the  intrinsic  dynamic  of  many  electronic  systems,  which  usually  produce  a  α 

exponent equal to one, and associate with the 1/f process like.  

Meanwhile TSA results show that these two internet traffic time series are very 

complicated  systems  with  local  H(t)  cover  from  negative  value  to  positive  value. 

However, TSA provide us extra information compare to PSA and DFA, since it give the 

local singularities multifractal behaviors.  A good quantitative description can advanced 

our understanding of these two internet traffic time series. 

 

VII.   Conclusion 

 

In  this  paper,  we  have  examined  the  fractal  characteristics  and  long-range 

dependence in these two internet traffic time series.  We examined these LOC(request) 

and LOC(send) time series by three techniques: power-spectral analysis(PSA), detrended 

fluctuation analysis (DFA) and time-scale analysis(TSA).  Other techniques to examined 

long-range dependence, not discussed in this paper, include dispersional analysis[11] and 

maximum–likelihood estimator[12].  As summary, we find the following: 

(1) 

PSA quantify that (β : 1 < β < 2), (H : 0< H < 0.5), (ρ : -0.5< ρ < 0), and (D : 1< 

D <2).  PSA showed these two internet traffic time series exhibit the fractal and long-

range dependence characteristics. 

(2) 

we  have  used  detrended  fluctuation  analysis  (DFA)  method  to  analysis  the 

networking signals, and we find out that these signals exhibit crossover phenomenon at 

the  segment  length  of  60  and  400.  Besides,  signal  of  requesting  and  sending  have 

identical  α  exponent  which  show  white  noise  behavior  for  segment  length  of  60,  1/f 

process for segment length of 400, and a smother process (α = 2.00) for the entire signals.

TSA quantify that ( Local H(t) : -0.5 < H(t) < 1.5), (Global H : 0< H <0.5) and 

(1<  D  <  2).    TSA  showed  that  LOC(request)  and  LOC(send)  time  series  are  two 

complicated  time  series with local H(t) out of the range in between 0 to 1.  Therefore 

these require advanced quantitative and qualitative description of these signal to improve 

our understanding of the internet traffic time series.  In many ways, wavelets analysis are 

the most effective method to perform the fractal analysis since it can used for data sets 

that’s are nonstationary and can perform the multifractal measurements.   

According  the  analysis  results, we showed that the long-range dependence and 

fractal characteristics exhibit in these LOC(request) and LOC(send) time series.  As the 

value of H approach to zero, the systems became more complex. Therefore we suggest 

that  further  fractal  analysis  and  modeling  can  be  use  in  internet  traffic  time  series  to 

optimize the network utilities.

MEASUREMENT AND CORRECTION OF CROSS-PLANE COUPLING IN 

TRANSPORT LINES* 

 

M. Woodley, P. Emma, SLAC, Stanford, CA 94309, USA 

 
Abstract 

In future linear colliders the luminosity will depend on 
maintaining the small emittance aspect ratio delivered by 
damping rings.  Correction of cross-plane coupling can be 
important  in  preventing  dilution  of  the  beam  emittance.  
In order to minimize the vertical emittance, especially for 
a flat beam, it is necessary to remove all cross-plane (x-y) 
correlations.    This  paper  studies  emittance  measurement 
and  correction  for  coupled  beams  in  the  presence  of 
realistic  measurement  errors.    The  results  of  simulations 
show that reconstruction of the full 4×4 beam matrix can 
be misleading in the presence of errors.  We suggest more 
robust tuning procedures for minimizing linear coupling. 

1  INTRINSIC EMITTANCE 

A  four-dimensional  (4D)  symmetric  beam  matrix,  σ, 
contains  ten  unique  elements,  four  of  which  describe 
coupling.  The projected (2D) beam emittances, ε
x and ε
y, 
are defined as the square roots of the determinants of the 
on-diagonal  2×2  submatrices.    If  one  or  more  of  the 
elements  of  the  off-diagonal  submatrix  is  non-zero,  the 
beam is x-y coupled.  Diagonalization of the beam matrix 
yields the intrinsic beam emittances, ε

1 and ε
2.

The coupling correction process involves measuring the 
ten elements of the beam matrix and finding a set of skew 
quadrupole  strengths  which  block  diagonalize  the  beam 
matrix,  setting 
linear 
coupling, equal to the intrinsic emittances.

2  SKEW CORRECTION SECTION 

The  ideal  skew  correction  section (SCS) contains four 
skew quadrupoles separated by appropriate betatron phase 
advance in each plane such that the skew quadrupoles are 
orthonormal  (orthogonal  and  equally  scaled).    A  simple 
realization  of  such  a  system  is  possible  if  the  skew 
quadrupoles  each  correct  just  one  of  the  four  x-y  beam 
correlations and if, in addition, the product β
β
y is equal at 
each  of  the  skew  quadrupoles.    Figure  1  shows  such  a 
system  for  the  250  GeV  NLC  beam,  followed  by  a  4D 
emittance measurement section (described below).  Skew 
quadrupoles at locations 1-4 (indicated at top of figure by 

x

diamond  symbols)  are  used  to  correct  the  <xy>,  <x′y′>, 
<x′y>,  and  <xy′>  beam  correlations,  respectively,  at 
location  4.    The  horizontal  and  vertical  betatron  phase 
advances between the skew quadrupoles are also indicated 
on the figure.  This scheme allows total correction of any 
arbitrary  linearly  coupled  beam  with  correction  range 
limited only by the available skew quadrupole strength.

3  4D EMITTANCE MEASUREMENT 
The  ideal  4D  emittance  measurement  section  contains 
six  beam  size  measurement  devices  (e.g.  wire  scanners) 
separated  by  appropriate  betatron  phase  advance  in  each 
plane  such  that  the  four  x-y  beam  correlations  may  be 
measured  independently.    Figure  1  illustrates  such  a 
system.    The  wire  scanners  at  locations  4-7  (circle 
symbols) are used to measure the <xy>, <x′y′>, <x′y>, and 
<xy′> beam correlations, respectively.  Each wire scanner 
has  three  independent  angle  filaments  —  an  x-wire,  a 
y-wire,  and  an  “off-axis”,  or  u-wire  whose  optimal 
orientation  is  given  by  the  inverse  tangent  of  the 
uncoupled beam aspect ratio, σ
x [1].  At each of these 
wire scanners σ
xy are measured.  An additional 
two  wire  scanners  (locations  8  and  9  in  Figure  1)  are 
required to determine the remaining in-plane correlations 
of the beam.  There are a total of 10 beam parameters to 
determine (ε
x,y, and the four x-y correlations) and 
up  to  18  beam  size  measurements,  leaving  8  degrees  of 
freedom  in  the  analysis.    The  analysis  consists  of 
expressing  the  beam  sizes  at  each  wire  in  terms  of  the 

y, and σ

Figure  2  shows  the  results  for  four  values  of  ferr  when 
the  simulated  input  beam  is  coupled  (ε
2 = 1.5),  while 
Figure  3  shows  the  results  for  an  uncoupled  input  beam 
(ε
y/ε
2 = 1).  Figures 2 and 3 show that when the beam size 
measurement  errors  are  more  than  a  few  percent,  the 
measurements  become  imprecise,  and  more  importantly, 
the most probable computed value for the intrinsic vertical 
emittance becomes erroneously small.  This bias may lead 
one to attempt to correct the implied coupling, which will 
actually  introduce  coupling  rather  than  correct  it.    An 
additional  problem,  in  the  presence  of  errors,  is  that  the 
4D  analysis  can  generate  solutions  for  which  the  beam 

matrix is nonpositive, yielding imaginary emittances.  As 
ferr becomes larger, the fraction of simulations which yield 
nonpositive  beam  matrices, 
the  ‘rejection  fraction’, 
increases  to  the  point  where  3  out  of  4  measurements 
yield non-physical results when ferr reaches 20 %.  Table 1 
summarizes 
the  4D  measurement 
simulations for a coupled input beam; Table 2 summarizes 
the results for an uncoupled input beam.  In each case, the 
most probable relative value of ε
20 is given, along with 
the  statistical  rms  width  of  the  distribution  (where  ε
20  is 
the ‘real’ intrinsic emittance used in the simulations).

4  2D EMITTANCE MEASUREMENT 
An  optimized  2D  emittance  measurement  section 
contains  four  wire  scanners  separated  by  45°  of  betatron 
phase  advance  in  both  planes.    Figure  4  shows  such  a 
system preceded by an SCS.  Each wire scanner has two 
independent angle filaments—an x-wire and a y-wire.  At 
each  wire  scanner  σ
y  are  measured.    There  are  a 
total of three beam parameters to determine (ε, β and α) 
and  four  beam  size  measurements in each plane, leaving 
one degree of freedom in the analysis for each plane.

5  COUPLING CORRECTION 

Given 

the  unreliability  of 

the  4D  emittance 
measurement,  we  propose,  for  the  NLC,  the  coupling 
correction and 2D emittance measurement system shown 
in  Figure  4.    Coupling  correction  will  be  achieved  by 
sequentially  minimizing  the  measured  projected  vertical 
emittance  with  each  of  the  four  orthonormal  skew 
quadrupoles.  Figure 7 shows the Monte Carlo simulation 
of this process, assuming a coupled input beam (ε
2 > 3) 
and  10%  beam  size  measurement  errors.    Because  the 
optics  of  the  SCS  has  been  designed  to  make  the  skew 
quadrupoles orthonormal, a single pass through the set is 
sufficient  to  bring  the  projected  vertical  emittance  down 
to its intrinsic value to within measurement errors.

6  CONCLUSIONS 

that 

Although 

it  may  seem 

the  4D  emittance 
measurement  is  the  most  direct  way  to  compute  skew 
corrections  for  a  coupled  beam,  simulations  show  that 
realistic  beam  size  measurement  errors  degrade  the 
analysis to the point where it becomes counter-productive.  
The 2D emittance measurement is far more reliable, and 
when  combined  with  an  orthonormal  skew  correction 
system,  provides  the  most  robust  method  for  correcting 
linear betatron coupling.

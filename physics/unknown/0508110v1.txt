Negative-index  refraction  is  achieved  in  a  lamellar  composite  with  epsilon-negative 

(ENG)  and  mu-negative  (MNG)  materials  stacked  alternatively.  Based  on  the 

effective  medium  approximation,  simultaneously  negative  effective  permittivity  and 

permeability  of  such  a  lamellar  composite  are  obtained  theoretically  and  further 

proven by full-wave simulations. Consequently, the famous left-handed metamaterial 

comprising  split  ring  resonators  and  wires  is  interpreted  as  an  analogy  of  such  an

lamellar  composite.  In  addition,  beyond 

the  effective  medium 

approximation,  the  propagating  field  squeezed  near  the  ENG/MNG  interface  is 

demonstrated to be left-handed surface waves with backward phase velocity.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Electromagnetic  composite  metamaterials  with  simultaneously  negative  electric 

permittivity 

effε

  and  magnetic  permeability 

,  called  left-handed  materials 

effµ

(LHM), have been a subject of scientific interest over the past several years [1-5]. So 

far,  there  are  a  few  ways  towards  the  realization  of  an  LHM.  For  examples,  the 

metallic  metamaterial  comprising  periodically  arranged  split  ring  resonators  (SRR) 

and wires was experimentally confirmed to be an LHM [3]. The possibility of forming 

an  LHM  in  conducting  magnetic  granular  composite  (incorporating  conducting 

ferromagnetic inclusions into an insulating matrix) was theoretically investigated [4]. 

More recently, Liu et al. proposed a piezoelectric-piezomagnetic multilayer and found 

that  simultaneously  negative 

effε

  and 

effµ

  would  be  available  in  such  a  structure 

[5]. 

It  is  easy  to  understand  that,  since  there  is  no  naturally  existing  LHM,  the 

straightforward  ideas  towards  the  realization of an LHM are how to combine single 

negative  materials,  namely,  epsilon-negative  (ENG)  material  (where 

0<ε

,  but 

0>µ

) or mu-negative (MNG) material (where 

0<µ

, but 

0>ε

), under appropriate 

volume  fraction  to  get  an  effective  LHM  [3],  or  alternatively,  how  to  get  negative 

effµ

  in  materials  having  negative 

  and  vice  versa.  It  was  reported  that  paired 

effε

structure  by  ENG  and  MNG  materials  can  lead  to  interesting  characteristic,  such  as 

resonance,  tunneling  and  transparency  [6].  Guided  mode  along  the  interface  of  a 

pairing  ENG-MNG  waveguide  was  also  theoretically  analyzed  [7].  An  intriguing 

phenomenon  from  the  alternating  layers  of  ENG  and  MNG  materials  is  that  it  can 

 

2

respond effectively in many ways like an LHM, such as, the negative effective index 

of  refraction  and  the  backward  phase  direction,  except  that 

effε

  and 

effµ

  do  not 

generally exist [8]. In this paper, we consider such an ENG-MNG lamellar structure to 

investigate  its  negative-index  refraction  by  full-wave  numerical  simulations.  It  is 

distinct  from  Ref.  8  in  that  the  electromagnetic  waves  in  this  paper  are  incident 

parallel  to  the  laminate  slices.  In  Sec.  II,  based  on  effective  medium  approximation 

(i.e., 

the 

thicknesses  of 

the  slices  are  small  enough  comparing  with 

the 

electromagnetic wavelength), negative-index refraction and planar slab focusing with 

simultaneously  negative 

effε

  and 

effµ

  are  demonstrated  in  the  structure,  and  the 

SRR-wire  metamaterials  are  interpreted  as  an  analogy  of  the  lamellar  composite. 

Section  III  presents 

that,  beyond 

the  effective  medium  approximation, 

the 

electromagnetic  field  squeezed  near  the  ENG/MNG  interface  is  in  fact  left-handed 

surface  waves  with  negative-index  refraction  as  well  as  backward  phase  direction. 

Finally, conclusions are given in Sec. IV. 

II. EFFECTIVE MEDIUM APPROXIMATION 

A. Left-handed lamellar composite 

Consider a lamellar composite as shown in Fig. 1. Two infinite slices, one is an 

ENG  layer  (

ε

µ

,  thickness 

1d

)  and  the  other  an  MNG  layer 

(

ε

2

0,>

µ

2

0<

,  thickness 

2d

),  are  stacked  alternatively  along  the  x-axis.  Based  on 

the  effective  medium  approximation  (i.e.,  both 

1d

  and 

2d

  are  extremely  smaller 

than the electromagnetic wavelength), the components of 

ε

  and 

µ   can be given by

Therefore,  the  lamellar  structure  is  a  uniaxially  anisotropic  composite  (i.e.,  it  is 

isotropic  in  the  plane  perpendicular  to  the  x-axis).  For  simplicity  without  loss  of 

generality, suppose 

d =

Such a structure can thus be treated as an indefinite medium in which not all of the 

principle components of 

ε

  and 

µ   have the same sign [12]. What is of considerable 

interest  is  that,  as  long  as  the  electromagnetic  wave  is  incident  with  proper 

polarization, an indefinite medium (here, the ENG-MNG lamellar composite) may be 

identical in refraction property with an isotropic LHM [12]. Generally speaking, the 

prerequisites are as follows: 

|

ε

ε

Full-wave  numerical  simulations  are  performed  to  demonstrate  the  above 

conclusions. For the sake of simulations, it is not restricted to particular materials. As 

for the nonmagnetic ENG layer, it can be a metal, metamaterial of intersecting wires, 

 

4

or piezoelectric material, etc., while for the MNG layer; it can be an antiferromagnetic 

material, SRR metamaterial, or piezomagnetic material, etc.. Consider two slices of an 

ENG  layer

On  the  one  hand,  when  the  electromagnetic  wave  is  s-polarized  (i.e.,  electric 

field  in  the  x-direction),  as  far  as  the  refraction  property  is  concerned,  it  should  be 

equivalent to an isotropic and homogenous LHM having 

ε

= µ

-1=

. As shown in Fig. 

2(a), such a lamellar composite in wedge shape is used to simulate its refraction field 

distribution  with  appropriate  boundary  conditions  (the  surroundings  of  the  wedge  is 

vacuum).  From  the  intuitive  viewpoint,  the  wedge  is  cut  in  45°  angle  so  that  the 

transmitted beam should be bent in 90° angle with respect to the incident s-polarized 

beam [see Fig. 2(a)]. Backward phase moving is also confirmed when the s-polarized 

wave propagates in the wedge, which gives a further evidence of the negative-index 

refraction  in  such  an  ENG-MNG  lamellar  composite.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the 

electromagnetic wave is p-polarized (i.e., magnetic field in the x-direction), it should 

act  as  an  isotropic  medium  with 

=effn

0.59

  (

0.8=effε

, 

=effµ

0.44

);  this  is 

consistent  with  the  numerical  result  shown  in  Fig.  2(b).  Additionally,  from  the 

simulations,  it  is  found  the  impedance  matching  condition  between  the  wedge  and 

vacuum is 

1=effη

, which is satisfied in the s-polarized  case  of  Fig.  2(a).  However, 

 

5

for  the  p-polarized  wave,  there  are  obvious  reflections  due  to  the  impedance  of  the 

lamellar  composite  mismatching  to  the  vacuum.  For  another  example,  replacing  the 

slices with an ENG layer 

ε
=(
1

-0.5,

µ

1

=

0.5)

  and an MNG layer 

(

ε

2

2,=

µ

2

-2)=

, 

from  which 

-1=effn

  and 

=effη

0.75

  for  s-polarized  wave,  the  reflections  at  the 

wedge  interfaces  are  obvious  though

ε

  and 

|

  in  this  case  (not 

shown).   

Planar  slab  focusing  is  another  interesting  feature  of  a  homogeneous  LHM. 

Though the lamellar composite is effectively an indefinite medium [see Eqs. (9) and 

(10)],  it  can  still  focus  s-polarized  waves  as  if  it  were  an  isotropic  LHM  due  to  its 

in-plane  isotropic  property  (

µ

µ
= z

y

-1=

).  In  Fig.  3,  a  current  line  source  excites  a 

cylindrical  s-polarized  wave  with  a  frequency  of  50  GHz.  As  is  expected,  there  are 

two equidistant images reproduced, one is in the center of the lamellar composite, and 

the other outside of it. Additionally, strong surface waves are also observed along the 

interfaces between the lamellar composite and vacuum, which is due to the existence 

of surface polaritons [13].

B. Dependence on thickness ratio   

For brevity we have confined the discussion under the circumstance of

. 

effn

, by 

tailoring  the  ratio  of  the  thicknesses,  without  resorting  to  new  materials  having 

different 

ε

  and 

µ . 

C. Interpretation of the SRR-wire metamaterial 

After  the  demonstration  that  an  ENG-MNG  lamellar  composite  can  effectively 

 

6

act as an LHM under the effective medium approximation, we have some remarks on 

the  famous  negative  refraction  experiment  by  an  SRR-wire  metamaterial  in  wedge 

shape [3]. The original idea was to obtain a metamaterial with its negative 

effε

  of the 

wire  array  and  negative 

  of  the  SRR  array,  and  it  was  supposed  that 

effµ

electromagnetic  interactions  between  the  SRR  and  wire  arrays  were  negligible. 

However, the interpretation was questioned in Ref. 14, in which the main viewpoint is 

that  an  LHM  can  not  be  achieved  by  simply  placing  wires  (negative 

effε

)  in  a 

homogeneous host with negative 

µ . From the viewpoint of this work, the SRR-wire 

metamaterial  can  be  regarded  as  an  analogy  of  the  ENG-MNG  lamellar  composite, 

with wire layers as the ENG material and SRR layers as the MNG material [15]. Two 

relations  are  given  to  the  SRR-wire  metamaterial,  no  matter  it  is  one-dimensional, 

two-dimensional, or three-dimensional:

wire  array,  while 

SRRµ

  and

  are  permeability  components  in  the  direction 

perpendicular  to  the  SRR-plane. 

SRRd

  and 

wired

  are  the  intervals  of  SRR  and  wire 

layers, respectively. 

III. BEYOND EFFECTIVE MEDIUM APPROXIMATION 

    In  this  section,  we  consider  the  ENG  and  MNG  materials  with  thicknesses  larger 

enough  than  the  electromagnetic  wavelengths  such  that  the  effective  medium 

 

7

approximation  is  not  applicable.  Because  neither  the  ENG  nor  MNG  material  itself 

supports the propagation of electromagnetic waves, therefore, the transmitted field, if 

any, is in fact squeezed near the interface layers. The wavevecter components in the 

where  the  transversal  wavevector  components, 

1xk

  and 

2xk

,  are  related  as  follows

            (P-polarized waves).            (20) 

From  Eqs.  (19)  and  (20),  one  can  see  that  the  surface  waves  transmitted  along  the 

 

8

ENG/MNG interface has an effective index of refraction. It is interesting and worth of 

emphasis  that  the  effective  index  of  refraction  is  negative  and  hence  left-handed 

surface  wave  is  obtained  though  no 

effε

  and 

effµ

  can  be  derived  under  this 

configuration; this is confirmed in the following simulations. Consider again the ENG 

layer

  and  MNG  layer 

(

  at  frequency  of  50 

GHz,  but  now  with  thicknesses 

d

1

d
= 2

3=

mm  (larger  thicknesses  are  less 

computationally  efficient).  Firstly,  for  s-polarized  waves,  negative  refraction  and 

anti-parallel phase velocity in the wedge are demonstrated in Fig. 4(a). The negative 

index  from  the  simulation  by  using  Snell’s  law  is  consistent  with  that  in  Eq.  (19), 

from  where  one  gets 

=effn

-0.315

.  Figure  4(b)  shows  the  cross-sectional  field 

distribution. It is found that the electromagnetic field is squeezed near the ENG/MNG 

interface and degenerated much quickly in the MNG layer than that in the ENG layer. 

This  is  because  the  transversal  fields  away  from  the  interface  are  evanescent 

exponentially  into  the  ENG  and  MNG  materials  with  the  factors  of 

exp

(-

xk
1x

)

  and 

exp

[-

(

d-x

)]

,  respectively  [13],  where 

2x

  from  Eq.  15.  Secondly, 

such  an  ENG/MNG  interface  can  not  support  the  propagation  of p-polarized waves, 

since one gets 

0<2
effn

  from Eq. 20. 

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 

In  conclusion,  negative-index  refraction  is  demonstrated  in  an  ENG-MNG 

lamellar  composite  with  full-wave  simulations  on  the  scenes  of  the  wedge-based 

negative refraction and planar slab imaging. Firstly, 

effε

  and 

effµ

  of such a lamellar 

structure can be obtained based on the effective medium approximation, which hence 

 

9

can  be  regarded  effectively  as  a  left-handed  composite.  Secondly,  SRR-wire 

metamaterials can be interpreted as an analogy to this model. Thirdly, When the ENG 

and  MNG  materials  are  thicker  enough  than  the  electromagnetic  wavelength;  the 

propagation  of  the  electromagnetic  field  is  demonstrated  numerically  to  be 

left-handed  surface  waves  with  negative  effective  index  of  refraction  as  well  as 

backward phase direction.

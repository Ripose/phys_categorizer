Abstract.  

We have performed the harmonic analysis of the steady-state coherent pulse-stacking process 
in a high-Q Fabry-Perot cavity. The expression for the stacked pulse shape is obtained as a function 
of  both  the  laser  cavity  and  pulse-stacking  cavity  parameters.  We  have  also  estimated  the  pulse 
power  gains  attainable  in  the  laser-optical  system  of  NESTOR  storage  ring,  which  is  under 
development  at  Kharkov  Institute  of  Physics  and  Technology.  It  is  shown  that  high  power  gains 
(~104)  can  be,  in  principle,  achieved  in  a  cavity,  formed  with  low-absorption,  high  reflectivity 
(R≈0.9999) mirrors, if the laser carrier frequency will be matched to the second harmonic frequency 
of the pulse-stacking cavity. This means a development of the sophisticated frequency stabilization 
loop for maintaining the cavity length constant within a sub-nanometer range.

Introduction 

Over  the  last  two  decades  Compton  scattering  (CS)  of  the  laser  light  by  the  electrons 
circulating  in  the  storage  ring  was  extensively  used  for  production  of  the  quasi-monochromatic 
highly  polarized  γ-beams  in  the  energy  range  from  30  MeV  to  2  GeV  for  nuclear  physics 
experiments  [1].  Implementation  of  this  technique  at  medium-  and  low-energy  circular  machines 
was  hampered  by  the  strong  space-charge  effects.  After  publication  of  Telnov’s  article  on  laser-
electron cooling [2] a number of projects has appeared where CS has been considered as a tool for 
production of the intensive X-ray beams at low-energy (E0=10÷200 MeV) compact electron storage 
rings [3,4]. Lastly, the most promising and, at the same time, the most challenging are the schemes 
of using CS for e-γ - conversion in linear supercolliders [5,6]. 

The  common  feature  of  all  these  facilities  is  the  problem  of  obtaining  the  intensive  laser 
pulses with pulse width of ~10 ps and pulse energy of ~10 mJ (for γγ - colliders these values are ~1 
ps and ~1 J, respectively) that follow at a repetition frequency of 100÷500 MHz. The only feasible 
solution  that  naturally  suggests  itself  is  coherent  stacking  of  laser  pulses  with  required  time 
characteristics in a high-Q optical cavity system. The latter can be a simple two-mirror open cavity 
(Fabri-Perot  cavity)  [7,8],  a  two-mirror  cavity  with  one  compound  mirror  for  extraction  of  the 
secondary photon beam [9], or it can represent a pair of optical cavities, one of them imbedded into 
the other [10,11]. In the last case the external cavity can comprise a low-gain regenerative amplifier 
for compensation of energy losses in the system [10]. 

Today the stacking of continuous wave (CW) laser beams in a Fabry-Perot cavity is a well-
established  technique,  and  it  is  extensively  used  in  various  fields  of  physics:  gravitational 
interferometers  [12],  laser-wire  beam  profile  monitors  [13],  etc.  Implementation  of  this  technique 
for quasi-CW laser beams (henceforth, we apply this term for a continuous succession of short laser 
pulses  following  at  a  high  repetition  frequency  from  a  mode-locked  laser)  is  encountered  with 
difficulties. The essential requirement to the resonance optical system, intended for stacking of

short  laser  pulses,  is  coherence  of  pulse-summing process that ensures accumulation of energy in 
the  laser  pulse  without  deterioration  of  its  spatial  and  temporal  characteristics.  To  meet  this 
requirement the axial-mode spectrum of the pulse-stacking cavity (PSC) has to match the harmonic 
spectrum of quasi-CW laser beam, the latter being coincident with the mode spectrum of the laser 
cavity with active element. 

Feasibility of coherent pulse stacking in a high-Q open cavity was recently demonstrated by 
R.J. Loewen at SLAC [8]. Iteratively adjusting the cavity length eventually enabled the laser to lock 
in  2÷3  ms  intervals  to  the  peak  axial  mode  in  a  6.7  kHz  bandwidth  cavity  (mirrors  reflectivity 
R=0.9998). The accumulation factor was estimated to be ≈4500. It should be noted that the natural, 
manufacturer-specified, laser pulse width of 7ps was stretched up to 25-30 ps in order to eliminate 
the  significant  dispersion  effects.  The  effect  of  dispersion  mismatch  between  the  laser  cavity  and 
PSC was also discussed in this work and assumed to be insignificant for pulse widths considered. 
To evaluate dispersion effects correctly one has to solve the problem in the frequency domain, i.e. 
perform a harmonic analysis of the stored pulse. 

In this paper we present the results of sequential harmonic analysis of the steady-state pulse-
stacking  process  in  a  high-Q  Fabry-Perot  cavity  together  with  some  estimations  for  NESTOR 
storage ring, which is under development at Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology [4]. 

1. General description. 

In general, it is rather difficult to gain matching between the laser and the PSC, because not 
only  cavity  lengths  have  to  be  matched  but  also  their frequency spectra have to be identical. The 
main  causes  that  hamper  the  matching  are  dispersion  in  the  optical  elements  and  the  essential 
difference  in  reflector  parameters  that  form  these  cavities.  The  last  ensues  from  different 
requirements set up to the laser and pulse-stacking cavities. 

The  laser  cavity  reflectors  have  a  large  curvature  radius  in  order  to  form  a  wide  beam  thus 
ensuring  effective  interaction  with  the  lasing  medium  all  around  the  cavity.  Reflectivity  of  the 
mirror,  through  which  the  laser  beam  is  extracted,  has  to  be  low  (R~0.9)  in  order  to  attain  a 
reasonable efficiency of the laser system and to provide the required output power. 

The  mirrors  of  the  PSC  have  to  meet  practically  contrary  requirements.  For  achievement  of 
high  accumulation 
to  be  high-reflectivity  mirrors 
(R=0.999÷0.9999).  The  radius  of  curvature ρc  has  to  be  rather  small  (ρc≈Lc/2,  where  Lc  is  cavity 
length) in order to focus the laser beam to the required spot size in the point of its interaction with 
the electron beam.

mode frequency shift due to the wave-front curvature tied in with sphericity of the cavity mirrors. 
For the plane-parallel cavity (ρc→∞) this term vanishes while for the concentric cavity it tends to 
unity. For these two extreme cases the difference in mode frequencies with the same longitudinal 
index  q  is  equal  to  free  spectral  range  fFSR.  The  similar  effect  on  the  spectra  of  cavity  modes 
produces  a  difference  in  the  phases 
cr&ϕ  of complex reflectivity of the cavity mirrors. For the real 
parameters of the laser and pulse-stacking cavities their spectra are shifted one against the other by 
the value less than fFSR.

This effect is illustrated in Fig. 1a where the spectra of two cavities, namely, laser cavity (Ll, 
ϕ , q) are sketched. Here the laser cavity with active element is

the  dispersion  in  optical  elements  of  the  picosecond  laser.  The  cavity  lengths  are  matched,  i.e. Ll 
=Lc.  To  drive  the  PSC  at  the  laser  carrier  frequency ω0=2πf0  =2πc/λ,  which  corresponds  to  the 
fundamental  cavity  mode  with  longitudinal  index  n,  one  has  to  match  this  frequency  to  the 
frequency  of  the  PSC  fundamental  mode  with  longitudinal  index  q  or  to  the  frequency  of  any  of 
PSC modes lying in close proximity to the fundamental one. It can be done either by changing the 
carrier frequency via a proper adjustment of the laser cavity length or by changing the PSC length. 
In both these cases the free spectral ranges for two cavities become unequal (f l
FSR), so the 
mode frequencies in two cavities get different shifts against the matched mode frequency f l
n = f c
q. 
Fig. 1b illustrates how the frequencies of the PSC modes shift in both sides from the matched-mode 
frequency  when  the  PSC  length  is  adjusted  for  mode  matching.  The  frequency  shift  between  two 
modes,  equidistant  from  the  matched  modes  by  number  m,  can  be  obtained  from  the  following 
relation:

where ∆L=Ll-Lc.  One  can  see  that  this  shift  is  proportional  to  the  relative  difference  of  the  laser 
cavity and PSC lengths, and it linearly increases for equidistant harmonics with their displacement 
from the matched modes. So, the quasi-CW laser beam sidebands will drive the PSC at frequencies 
that  correspond  to  the  wings  of  its  resonance  curves instead of their peaks. It changes the phases 
and amplitudes of harmonic components of the stored pulse against their values in the incident laser 
pulse.  It  can  lead  to  distortion  of  the  time  profile  of  the  stored  picosecond  laser  pulse  and  to  it’s 
lengthening that finally results in lower accumulation factors achieved.  

Below  we  present  the  results  of  study  of  pulse-stacking  process  in  the  high-Q  two-mirror 
cavity  by  methods  of  harmonic  spectral  analysis.  Absorption  in  cavity  mirrors  is  not  taken  into 
account (A=0), because our preliminary study shows that it does not affect the time characteristics 
of  the  stored  pulse  while  essentially  complicates  the  derived  expressions.  Absorption  reduces  the 
accumulation  factor  (especially,  for  ultra  high-reflectivity  mirrors  R∼0.9999)  and  can  be  easily 
taken into account as a correction to the formulae obtained in this work.

By  substituting  Eqs  (16),  (17)  and  (20)  in  Eq.  (12)  one  can  obtain  the  final  solution  for  the 

stored pulse at z=-Lc/2. 

3. Calculation results and discussion 

Before performing calculations let’s look closely at the derived formulae in order to analyze 

the effect of parameters of the laser-optical system on the stored pulse characteristics. 

The expressions (16), (17) describe a behavior of the modulus and phase of the PSC transfer 
function for all laser beam harmonics. It is seen that in the case of the ideal matching of the PSC 
and  laser  beam  spectra  (∆L/Ll=0)  all  harmonics  do  not  sustain  any  changes  except  the  same 
, so the stored pulse keeps the original shape of the incident 
amplitude enhancement by factor

achieved  in  two-mirror  stacking  cavity  with  non-absorptive  mirrors.  If  ∆L/L
phases  of  the  transfer  functions  for  various  harmonics  differ,  and  this  difference  increases  as  the 
frequency  shift  between  harmonic  and  carrier  frequency  increases.  Since  the  distant  harmonics 
define  mainly  the  pulse  fronts,  one  can  anticipate  a  widening  of  the  stored  pulse  (in  the  time 
domain) against the incident one. For the shorter pulses this effect will be more pronounced than for 
the  longer  ones.  Another  important  parameter  strongly  affecting  the  stored  pulse  shape  is  the 
reflectivity of the PSC mirrors rc.  

We performed calculations by using the derived formulae in order to evaluate the influence of 
the  PSC  parameters  and  the  incident  pulse  width  on  the  stored  pulse  characteristics.  The 
calculations were made for the parameters that are relevant to the laser-optical system of NESTOR 
facility  [4],  where  we  are  intended  to  use  the  mode-locked  Nd:YAG  laser  (λ=1064  µm)  with  an 
average  beam  power  of  10  W.  Two  possible  PSC  configurations  were  considered:  0.42m  (short) 
cavity  and  2.52m  (long)  cavity.  The  first  one  corresponds  to  facility  operation  with  18  electron 

 

7 

bunches  (every  second  electron  bunch  of  the  total  36  is  used  for  interaction)  and  a  high  laser 
repetition rate frep=350 MHz. The long cavity is now considered as a backup version for operation 
with  only  3  bunches  and  a  relatively  low  repetition  rate  of  laser  pulses  (frep≈58  MHz).  The  first 
variant  is  preferable  in  aspect  of  efficiency  of  using  the  electron  beam,  because  no  sub-harmonic 
prebunching of the injected beam is provisioned for NESTOR, and all RF-buckets will be filled.  

The radius of curvature of PSC mirrors ρc≈21.4cm was chosen so as to obtain the transverse 
beam-waist size 2w0 =200µm. The same parameter for laser mirrors was varied so as to obtain the 
beam-waist size in the laser cavity 1mm and 2mm. The reflectivity of the laser mirrors was taken to 
be 0.95, while PSC mirrors reflectivity ranged from 0.999 to 0.9999.  

In Fig. 3 the time profile of the stored pulse is presented both for the short (a, c) and long (b, 
d) cavity and for medium-reflectivity (a, b) and high-reflectivity (c, d) mirrors. The incident laser 
pulse width 7ps (FWHM) corresponds to the specified value of picoTRAIN series of mode-locked 
lasers manufactured by High-Q Laser Production GmbH [14]. In vertical scale the instant power in 
stored laser pulse - Istored is plotted in arbitrary units. The incident laser pulse amplitude is unity, so

from a comparison of the peak power value from the figure with the square of

using the simple relation (18), we can deduce how close to the ideal matching we approach. Note, 
that (

mode TM00q is matched to the laser cavity mode TM00n-1. We can also deduce from the figure the

for  medium-reflectivity  mirrors  we  come  very  close  to  the  ideal  matching  results,  i.e.

for the PSC with high-reflectivity mirrors only one cavity mode can provide the reasonable 
(for  given  mirror  parameters)  amplitude  gain;  the  cavity  with  medium-reflectivity  mirrors 
permits  one  to  use  several  modes,  thus  simplifying  mode  matching  and  widening  the 
operation range; 
the  long-cavity  version  yields  to  the  short-cavity  one,  this  disadvantage  becomes  more 
pronounced with an increasing of mirror reflectivity; 

•  pulse-shape  distortion  and  pulse  widening  is  conspicuous  only  for  the  non-optimal  mode-
matching,  except  the  case  of  long  PSC  with  high  reflectivity  mirrors;  more  detailed 
consideration shows that this effect is more noticeable for the high-reflectivity mirrors. 

The  last  effect  is  seen  clearly  in  Fig.  4  where  the  shape  of  the  stored  pulse  is  given  for 
different  reflectivity  of  the  PSC  mirrors  and  two  different  radii  of  curvature  of  the  laser  mirrors. 
Only  the  optimal  inter  cavity  mode  shift  q=n-1  is  presented.  Solid  lines  correspond  to  large 
curvature radius of the laser mirror ρl=41.7 m providing 2mm beam waist in the laser crystal, while 
the dashed lines correspond to ρl=3.2 m that provides 1mm beam waist. In the last case the essential 
decreasing  of  the  stored  pulse  power  gain  is  seen  for  high-reflectivity  mirrors.  The  noticeable 
widening of the stored pulse for the PSC with high-reflectivity mirrors is also seen: by factor 1.5 
and 1.8 for ρl=41.7 m and ρl=3.2 m, respectively.

Fig.  5.  Time  profiles  of  the  20  ps  laser  pulse  stored  in  0.42m  PSC  with  different  mirror 

We also performed calculations for the 20 ps laser pulse in order to understand how much the 
considered effects will be alleviated for the longer pulses. The results presented in Figure 5, when 
compared with those in Figure 3 (a, c), show: 

• 

• 

- a  number  of  PSC  axial  modes  which  can  be  used  for  pulse  stacking  in  the  medium-
reflectivity  version  increases  while  in  the  high-reflectivity  version  only  q=n-1  case  is 
admissible; 
- peak  power  in  the  high-reflectivity  version  essentially  increases  against  the  case  of  7ps 
pulses, and for optimal matching q=n-1 it approaches the ideal matching value. 

Peak power gain which is amplitude gain squared doesn’t take into account pulse widening of 
the stored pulse. When this widening is within controllable limits it is useful to define the power 
gain factor kph as a figure of merit that describes a pulse-stacking efficiency:

where Istored(t) and Iincident(t) are power intensity of the stored and incident laser pulse, respectively. 
This parameter is displayed in Fig. 6 versus cavity mode shift q-n for two values of PSC mirrors 
reflectivity  and  two  pulse  durations.  One  can  see  that  the  long-pulse  results  show  a  systematical 
excess over the short-pulse data except the case of optimal mode matching for R=0.999, where both 
points coincide giving maximal value of 103 (no dispersion effects).

The power gain factor kph can be obtained experimentally by measuring the incident, reflected 
and  transmitted  power  [8],  while  it  is  impossible  to  measure  directly  the  pulse  width  inside  the 
pulse-stacking  cavity.  One  has  to  apply  a  scheme  like  that,  discussed  in  [10]  for  extracting  the 
stacked pulse from the PSC after desired number of round-trips, and to measure parameters of the 
extracted pulse. 

Conclusion 

We have analyzed the effects of mode matching between the laser cavity and pulse-stacking 
cavity upon the stored pulse width and stored power. It is shown that for high reflectivity mirrors 
(R≈0.9999) high power gains can be obtained only if the laser carrier frequency coincides with the 
definite axial mode frequency of the PSC, namely with that second to the fundamental mode. For 
the laser pulse parameters, required for X-ray production in the compact storage ring, it means that 
both cavity lengths have to differ by one half of the laser wavelength, and these conditions have to 
be maintained during all period of generation. This task is the present state-of-the-art of laser optics 
technology,  and  it  requires  much  efforts,  both  financial  and  scientific,  to  develop  a  laser  pulse 
stacking system with power gains up to 104.

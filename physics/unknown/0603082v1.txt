Abstract:  The analysis of optical pulse generation by phase modulation of 
narrowband  continuous-wave  light,  and  subsequent  propagation  through  a 
group-delay-dispersion  circuit,  is  usually  performed  in  terms  of  the  so-
called  bunching  parameter.  This  heuristic  approach  does  not  provide 
theoretical  support  for  the  electrooptic  flat-top-pulse  generation  reported 
recently.  Here,  we  perform  a  waveform  synthesis  in  terms  of  the  Fresnel 
images  of  the  periodically  phase-modulated  input  light.  In  particular,  we 
demonstrate flat-top-pulse generation with a duty ratio of 50% at a quarter 
of  the  Talbot  condition  for  the  sinusoidal  phase  modulation.  Finally,  we 
propose a binary modulation format to generate a well-defined square-wave-
type optical bit pattern.

1.  Introduction

Generation  of  ultrashort  optical  pulses  at  high  repetition  rates  is  a  subject  of  increasing 
interest,  which  finds  substantial  application  in  ultrahigh-speed  optical  communications  [1]. 
Ultrashort pulses obtained directly from passively mode-locked lasers suffer from the lack of 
electrical control of the pulse parameters, such as pulse width, pulse shape, and pulse position 
in a time slot. Moreover, it is not possible to tune the repetition rate for synchronization with 
other  electrical  signals.  The  above  limitations  can  be  overcome  by  the  use  of  external 
modulators  that  permit  ultrashort  pulse  generation  from  the  continuous  wave  (CW)  light 
emerging  from  a  narrowband  laser.  Amplitude  modulators  suffer  from  large  insertion  losses 
and  a  low  signal-to-noise  ratio  [2-4].  Alternatively,  phase  modulators  have  been  widely 
employed  for  pulse  pattern  generation  [5-8].  The  quasi-velocity-matched  guided-wave 
electrooptic  modulator  has  allowed  the  design  of  compact,  stable,  and  low-power  ultrashort 
optical  pulse  generators  [9].  In  a  different  context,  Sato  has  demonstrated  optical  pulse 
generation from a Fabry-Perot (FP) laser [10]. Here, no external modulation is employed. The 
physical  mechanisms  involved  are  the  gain  nonlinearities  and  the  four-wave  mixing  process 
that  originate  the  competition  among  the  longitudinal  modes  supported  by  the  laser  cavity 
[11-14].  The  CW  light  emerging  from  the  FP  laser  is  periodically  phase-modulated  with  a 
frequency that is exactly the free spectral range (FSR) of the cavity.

The  electrooptic  method  for  optical  pulse  generation  is  based  on  the  phase  modulation 
with  a  sinusoidal  signal  of  a  CW  beam  from  a  narrowband  laser  diode.  This  produces 
harmonic  sidebands  (THz)  around  the  optical  carrier  frequency  so  that  the  emerging 
waveform is strongly chirped. The optical field is launched through a group-delay-dispersion 
(GDD)  circuit  and  compressed  because  the  sweep  rate  acquired  upon  propagation  partially 
compensates  for  the  chirp.  Among  others,  a  single  mode  optical  fiber  (SMF)  of  adjusted 
length, a pair of diffraction gratings, an optical synthesizer, or a linearly chirped fiber Bragg 

grating  (LCFG)  have  been  employed  as  dispersive  delay  lines.  Specifically  we  mention 
generation of optical pulses with a temporal duration of 4.4 ps and with a duty ratio of 11% by 
means of a LCFG and an electrooptic modulator (EOM) [15].

Up  to  present,  only  an  heuristic  explanation  for  the  frequency  modulation  (FM)  to 
amplitude-modulation  (AM)  conversion  process  is  available.  The  bunching  parameter  B, 
defined  essentially  as  the  product  between  the  frequency  chirping  rate  and  the  GDD 
coefficient,  provides  a  rough  estimation  for  the  optimum  bunching  of  the  frequency 
components.  The  case  of 
  gives  the  condition  under  which  the  CW  light  is  optimally 
compressed. This method shows a low pulse extinction ratio. In fact, the optical frequency of 
the sinusoidally phase-modulated light is assumed to be linearly chirped within half a period. 
Nonlinear  chirped frequency  components yield other substructures  or broad wings, so that a 
considerable part of the energy lies outside the main pulse. On the other hand, note that blue-
chirping and red-chirping regions are repeated in every modulation period. As a result, both 
the normal GDD and the anomalous one are effective for this method. The normal dispersion 
corresponds  to  compression  of  red-chirped  portions  of  the  input  field,  whereas  blue-chirped 
portions are compressed by an anomalous dispersion circuit. Therefore, approximately half of 
the energy in the input field does not contribute to the bunching and generates an undesirable 
dc  floor  level.  Some  attempts  have  been  done  in  the  past  few  years  for  highly  extinctive 
electrooptic pulse pattern generation [16]. Apart from short pulse generation with a low duty 
ratio, flat-top-pulse generation with a duty ratio of nearly 50% has been very recently reported 
[15,17]. The condition needed to generate this waveform remains unknown. These pulses can 
be  used  for 
in  optical  fiber 
communication [18].

instance  for  return-to-zero  (RZ)  modulation  formats 

Here,  we  face  electrooptic  pulse  pattern  generation  from  a  radically  different  point  of 
view,  which  allows  nearly  background-free  picosecond  pulsation.  We  recognize  that,  as  a 
result  of  the  periodic  nature  of  the  phase  modulation,  when  the  chirped  light  has  evolved 
through  the  GDD  circuit,  the  output  intensity  is  also  periodic  in  the  time  coordinate,  with  a 
fundamental frequency that is, in general, the same as the one for the phase modulation f. But 
. The period is given by the 
the output intensity is also periodic with the GDD coefficient 
so-called  temporal  Talbot  dispersion  relationship, 
  [19-21].  Furthermore,  we 
show  that  a  remarkably  simple  formula  describes  the  optical  intensity  at  a  quarter  of  the 
Talbot  dispersion.  On  the  framework  of  the  space-time  analogy  [22],  the  above  results 
constitute the temporal analogue of the field diffracted by a pure phase grating [23-25]. The 
parameters  of  the  electrooptical  modulator,  the  frequency  of  the  driving  signal  and  the 
modulation  index, or alternatively  the FSR in a FP laser, together  with the GDD coefficient 
determine  unambiguously  the  waveform  achieved  at  the  output.  Specifically,  we  show  flat-
top-pulse  generation  with  a duty ratio  of 50% for  a modulation  index of 
 providing  the 
sought  theoretical  support  of  the  experimental  results  reported  in  [15,17].  The  present 
description  permits  to  identify  a  great  variety  of  other  pulse  profiles.  If  we  change 
continuously  the  dispersion  amount  in  the  GDD  circuit,  Fresnel  patterns  in  intensity 
corresponding  to  a  1D  sinusoidal  phase-only  grating  appear,  but  now  in  the  time  domain, 
subsequently  at  the  output  of  the  arrangement.  Of  course,  the  same  conclusion  applies  for 
other nonsinusoidal phase-only modulations.

This  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  the  evolution  of  the  optical  field 
associated with a periodically phase-modulated input light through an arbitrary GDD circuit is 
provided in terms of the Talbot dispersion amount. We illustrate several examples concerning 
synthesis  of  different  pulse  waveforms  at  different  dispersion  amounts.  In  Section  3,  the 
output pulse intensity is expressed in terms of a simple trigonometric formula when the output 
dispersion  corresponds  to  a  quarter  of  the  Talbot  dispersion.  We  identify  an  ultra-flat-top-
pulse pattern by binary phase modulation of CW light. Finally, in Section 4, the effect of the 

1=B2Φ221fTπ=Φ4πthird  order  dispersion  (TOD)  of  the  SMF,  or  alternatively  the  spectral  window  of  a  LCFG, 
when used as a GDD circuit is discussed.

 the TOD parameter of the fiber, and the power carried by individual pulses 
is  not  enough  to  excite  nonlinear  mechanisms  in  the  fiber  [26].  In  section  4  we  will  further 
consider the narrowband assumption.

To  illustrate  waveform  formation,  we  consider  a  realistic  example  concerning  sinusoidal 
 and 40 GHz, respectively. Different new

modulation where 
pulse  waveforms  not  yet  reported  are  obtained  by  changing

short pulse generation for 
. Here, a duty cycle (DC) of 33% is achieved. Note that 
in this case the signal is free of annoying wings and tails but a high dc-floor level is present, as 
shown  in  Fig.  2(a).  In  Fig.  2(b)  the  numerical  simulation  shows  a  short  pulse  with  a  DC  of 
approximately 18%. Although part of the energy lies outside the main pulse, the remaining dc-
floor level is low. Note that, aside for a temporal shift of half a period, the same profiles are 
achieved  when  the  dispersion  is  set  to 
  where  q  is  an  arbitrary  integer. 
We  also  claim  that  the  above  shapes  can  be  achieved  with  normal  GDD  as  well  as  with 
anomalous one.

3.  Flat-top-pulse  generation

In this section we particularize the above key equations when dispersion is set to a quarter of 
the Talbot dispersion. From Eqs. 7 and 8, for 

 we obtain (see Appendix)

   . 

(10)

Equation  10, which  is  one of the  main  results  of this  paper,  provides  theoretical  support  for 
electrooptic  flat-top-pulse  generation,  as  will  be  shown  next.  At  this  point  it  is  worth 
mentioning  that  the  spatial  analogue  of  the  above  formula  was  derived  in  [24,25],  in  the 
context  of  Fourier  optics,  to  describe  the  properties  of  the  irradiance  distribution 
corresponding  to  the  Fresnel  diffraction  patterns  of  a  one-dimensional  phase  grating. 
Therefore,  one  should  anticipate  the  above  result  within  the  framework  of  the  celebrated 
space-time analogy.

We note that Eq. 10 is valid for a general periodic phase function

achieved.  Equation  11  provides  an  analytical  formula  for  the  waveform  that  was 
experimentally obtained in references [15] and [17]. Furthermore, due to the periodic nature of

Next,  we  seek  a  different  phase  modulation  format  that  allows  ultra-flat-top-pulse 
generation.  With  this  aim,  we  consider  the  periodic  binary  phase-only  modulation  of  the

modulation  formats  in  optical  signal  transmission  and,  in  particular,  for  differential  phase-
shift-keyed transmission.

4.  GDD  circuit  analysis

A.  Standard SMF

It  is  usual  to  perform  the  FM  to  AM  conversion  process  by  means  of  a  SMF.  The  strongly 
chirped  light  emerging  from  the  electrooptical  modulator  is  temporally  distorted  and 
compressed  due  to  the  propagation  inside  the  fiber.  A  rigorous  analysis  of  the  quadratic 
approximation  in  Eq.  5  must  be  carried  out  to  test  the  performance  of  the  setup.  Generally 
,  should  be  limited  to

we  can  assume  that  the  main  contribution  to  the  output  intensity  comes  from  the  Bessel 
functions  with  an  order  lower  than  10.  Thus,  the  condition  for  the  validity  of  the  parabolic 
 
approximation  reads

B.  LCFG

The response of a LCFG operating in reflection is assumed to be a phase quadratic function 
only over a limited bandwidth 
. As a result two conditions must be fulfilled for the use of 
a LCFG as dispersive element. First, the carrier frequency should match the central frequency 
of the reflected spectral band of the grating. Second, the full spectral bandwidth of the phase-

5.  Conclusions

The evolution of an input field, consisted in a periodically phase-modulated CW light, into an 
arbitrary GDD circuit has been carried out in terms of the Talbot dispersion. The periodicity 
of  the  phase  function  has  allowed  us  to  derive  an  analytical  formula  for  the  FM  to  AM 
conversion  process  at  one  quarter  of  the  Talbot  dispersion.  Furthermore,  we  have  provided 
theoretical support for the recently experimentally demonstrated generation of a flat-top-pulse 
train using a phase modulator and a LCFG. We have also considered the generation of ultra-
flat-top  light  pulses  by  phase  modulation  with  a  square-wave-type  signal,  which  could  be 
employed for RZ modulation format. We numerically show that a SMF or LCFG can be used 
as  an  efficient  GDD  device  in  terms  of  the  spectral  bandwidth  of  the  modulated  signal.  We 
would  like  to  mention  that  the  mathematical  framework  developed  in  this  work  is  also 
applicable  to  the  case  of  a  multimode  laser  source,  such  as  a  FP  laser,  working  in  the 
frequency-modulated  supermode  regime.  In  this  case,  the  frequency  of  the  equivalent 
modulator will be given by the free spectral range of the longitudinal modes supported by the 
laser  cavity.  In  the  framework  of  the  space-time  analogy,  the  above  results  constitute  the 
temporal analogue of the Fresnel diffraction field diffracted by a pure phase grating.

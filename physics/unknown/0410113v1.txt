Abstract  
This paper extends the results of a recently developed one-dimensional model aiming to describe 
the characteristics of a magnetized chlorine high-density plasma. In this work, the dependence of 
the  plasma  characteristics  on  the  magnetic  field  intensity  is  investigated.  It  is  shown  that  the 
dissociation degree and the relative weight of the various charged species is strongly influenced 
by  the  magnetic  field  when  the  gas  pressure  is  low  enough.  In  contrast,  at  higher  pressure,  the 
plasma is essentially composed of negative ions, and molecular neutrals and ions, independently 
of the field intensity. It is further demonstrated that diffusion needs to be considered in order to 
correctly predict the plasma behavior. 
 
1. Introduction  
In  a  previous  work  [1],  we  have  presented  preliminary  results  of  a  1-dimensional  fluid  model 
aiming to describe the characteristics of a magnetized chlorine high-density plasma in a pressure 
regime suitable for nanometer etching applications. This model allows to predict the dependence 
of various plasma characteristics, such as the concentration of charged and neutral species, on the 
experimental  conditions.  Previous  results  have  shown  that  the  model  correctly  predicts  the 
dependence  of  the  Cl  and  Cl2  densities  on  the  gas  pressure  as  well  as  that  of  Cl+  ions  and 
electrons.  In  the  present  paper,  we  extend  this  work  by  examining  the  influence  of  a  static 
magnetic field on the plasma characteristics. In particular, the densities of electrons, Cl, Cl2, Cl+, 
+  and  Cl-  are  calculated.  The  results  are  discussed  by  putting  the  emphasis  on  the  relative 
Cl2
importance  of  volume  reactions  with  respect  to  diffusion  in  the  particle  balance  of  charged 
species. 
 
2. Overview of the model 
The  model  was  discussed  in  more  details  in  a  previous  publication  [1].  In  brief,  it  is  based  on 
fluid equations, in which the particle balance equations for electrons, Cl, Cl2, Cl+, Cl2
+ and Cl- are 
solved  together  with  the  corresponding  flux  equations  and  the  energy  balance  equation.  For 
simplicity, the model is isothermal, which means that power deposition is considered as spatially 
uniform.  The  electronegative  nature  of  chlorine  requires  to  treat  the  plasma  sheath  in  detail  by 
solving  Poisson’s  equation.  In  these  conditions,  the  set  of  equations  to  be  solved  takes  the 
following form

coefficient and mobility, E the space-charge electric field, PV the average power absorbed by the 
plasma per volume unit and Q
 the average power dissipated per electron [2]. It is calculated by

summing  the  power  losses  due  to  all  electron-neutral  collision  processes  in  the  volume,  [3] 
neglecting the power losses to the wall. 
 
To  avoid  the  problem  of  solving  a  2-D  model,  the  axial  contribution  of  the  flux  in  Eq.  (1)  is 
treated  as  an  adjustable  constant  of  the  form  -(Da  /L
2)nk,  where  Da  is  taken  as  the  ambipolar 
diffusion  coefficient  and  L
  an  axial  diffusion  length.  As  will  be  seen,  although  being 
oversimplified,  this  approach  allows  to  reproduce  the  dependence  of  the  plasma  characteristics 
upon the magnetic field intensity.

where R is the vessel radius, ni the total positive ion density, Te and Tn the electron and neutral 
temperatures,  and  g   the  surface  recombination  coefficient  characterizing  the  interaction  of  Cl 
atoms  with  the  wall.  In  our  experimental  conditions,  the  value  of  g   that  provides  the  best 
agreement with the experimental data was found to be 0.02 [1].  
 
The  model  is  applied  to  the  case  of  a  bench-test  high-density  plasma  produced  by  a  190  MHz 
electromagnetic surface wave [4]. The plasma can be confined by a static magnetic field, whose 
strength  B0  can  be  varied  from  0 to about 1 kG. Note that the parameters used for calculations 
were chosen to match the most usual experimental conditions achieved in this reactor : PV = 2.5 
mW/cm3  (250 W  absorbed  power),  Tn  =  300  K,  L =140  cm.  As  our  model  is  isothermal,  the 
details  of  the  radial  plasma  structure  are  not  adequately  described.  Consequently,  it  is  more 
suitable  to  compare  model  and  experiment  by  using  cross-section  averaged  values  rather  than 
local values. 
 
3. Results of the model and comparison with experiments 
3.1 Characteristics of neutral species 
Figure  1  shows  the  dissociation  degree  t d  of  the  Cl2  molecules  as  a  function  of  the  initial  gas 
pressure for different values of the magnetic field intensity. For comparison (and testing of the 
model  validity),  experimental  data  obtained  at  B0=600  G,  using  the  Cl2  molecule  actinometry 
technique  proposed  by  Donnelly  [5],  are  also  shown  [6].  For  all  B0  values,  t d  is  observed  to 
decrease with increasing pressure, in agreement with the available experimental data. However, 
the variation of t d with pressure is more important when B0 is stronger. Thus, at low pressure, the 
gas phase is mostly populated by Cl atoms while at higher pressure, the molecular concentration 
becomes  significant.  In  contrast,  at  higher  pressure,  the  gas  phase  is  almost  independent  of  the 
magnetic field and is dominated by Cl2 molecules. 
 
We  have  examined  in  more  details  the  dependence  of  the  dissociation  degree  on  the  magnetic 
field  intensity  for  the  two  extreme  pressure  values  investigated  in  Fig.  1,  i.e.  1  and  10  mTorr.  
The  results  are  shown  in  Fig.  2.  At  1 mTorr,  t d  increases  very  steeply  with  B0  and  reaches  a 
plateau as soon as B0 gets higher than about 50 G. In this case, it is clear that applying a weak 
magnetic  field  presents  a  significant  advantage  to  enhance  the  Cl  fraction  in  the  plasma.  In 
contrast,  at  10  mTorr,  t d  is  almost  independent  of  B0  and  the  plasma  remains  essentially 
molecular. In these conditions, there is no more benefit to apply a magnetic field to the discharge.

3.2 Characteristics of charged species 
Figure 3 presents the density of electrons, Cl-, Cl+, and Cl2
+ as a function of the magnetic field 
intensity at 1 mTorr. As can be seen, all these densities increase with B0. This can be attributed to 
the  decrease  of  the  charged  species  losses  in  the  radial  direction  (i.e.  perpendicularly  to  the 
magnetic field). Indeed, above some B0 value, diffusion across the field becomes so small that the 
process  is  then  essentially  governed  by  the  axial  motion  and  is  therefore  independent  of  B0.  A 
similar behavior for the electron density was previously observed for a pure argon plasma [7]. 
 
On the other hand, Fig. 3 shows that the main negative charge carriers are the negative ions at 
low  magnetic  fields  and  the  electrons  at  higher  B0.  This  can  be  easily  understood  from  the 
observations of Fig. 2. Indeed, negative ions are mainly created through dissociative attachment, 
[1]. As a result, their relative importance in the plasma is directly related to the 
2Cl
Cl2 concentration; the higher this relative concentration, the larger the population of Cl- negative 
ions with respect to the electron population. Similar observations can be made when comparing 
+  and  Cl+  densities.  The  molecular  ion  dominates  the  ion  population  for  molecular  plasmas 
Cl2
while the opposite occurs for atomic plasmas. As creation is dominated by direct ionization of Cl 
atoms and Cl2 molecules [1], the larger is the molecular content of the plasma, the higher is the 
resulting Cl2

+ density.

As illustrated in Fig. 4, at 10 mTorr, the plasma exhibits a quite different behavior. In this case, 
the density of charged species is practically independent of B0. This clearly emphasizes that the 
magnetic  confinement  does  not  influence  the  plasma  any  more,  in  agreement  with  our 
observations on the dissociation degree. Figure 4 further indicates that Cl- and Cl2
+ are the main 
negative and positive charge carriers, the electron and Cl+ densities being more than one order of 
magnitude smaller. As mentioned earlier, as the plasma is essentially molecular, the negative and 
molecular positive ions dominate the population of charge carriers.

Figure  4:  Density  of  charged  particles  as  a  function  of  the  magnetic  field 
intensity for an initial gas pressure of 10 mTorr. 

The  results  presented  above  exhibit  some  features  that  were  previously  observed  in  pure  argon 
[2,7].  However,  as  chlorine  is  a  molecular  electronegative  gas,  it  is  additionally  subjected  to 
several  kinds  of  volume  losses  (in  particular  ion-ion  and  dissociative  recombination)  that  may 
affect  the  plasma  kinetics.  In  order  to  estimate  the  importance  of  the  volume  losses  and  their 
dependence on plasma conditions, we have calculated the volume loss rates of the various plasma 
species and well as the creation. Under steady-state conditions, the difference between creation 
and  volume  losses  is  due  to  diffusion  (see  Eq.  (1)).  The  results  obtained  for  electrons  are 
presented  in  Fig.  5  as  a  function  of  the  magnetic  field  intensity  at  a  gas  pressure  of  1  mTorr. 
Figure  5  shows  that  losses  are  diffusion-controlled  at  low  magnetic  field  while  volume  losses 
(mainly dissociative attachment and dissociative recombination) predominate above about 100 G. 
The  decreasing  importance  of  the  diffusion  contribution  to  losses  as  B0  increases  is  due  to  the 
confinement that progressively inhibits the diffusion motion in the direction perpendicular to the 
magnetic  field.  On  the  other  hand,  one  notes  a  significant  increase  of  volume  losses  with  B0 
which is caused by the corresponding increase of ne as shown in Fig. 3.

At  10 mTorr,  Fig.  6  shows  that  volume  losses  are  smaller  than  diffusion  losses  but  remain 
comparable to it. In contrast, at higher field, diffusion can completely be ignored. Overall, in this 
pressure  regime,  neglecting  diffusion  cause  a  significant  error,  except  when  a  significant 
magnetic  field  is  applied  (>  50-100  G).  Similar  trends  were  observed  for  all  the  other  charged 
species.  Therefore,  models  in  which  only  volume  losses  are  considered  for  describing  high-
density plasmas need to be revisited to the light of the present results.

4. Conclusion 
We  have  shown  that  the model that we have developed reproduces the pressure dependence of 
the dissociation degree in a chlorine high-density plasma. It was further shown that at sufficiently 
low pressure, the plasma species depend on the intensity of the confinement magnetic field. At 
low magnetic field, the concentration of molecular neutral and ions, as well as negative ions is 
significant,  while  at  higher  field,  atomic  neutral  and  positive  ion  species,  as  well  as  electrons 
dominate the plasma. For higher pressure, the magnetic field intensity has only a weak influence 
on  the  plasma  composition.    Finally,  we  have  demonstrated  that,  in  most  general  conditions, 
models need to include diffusion to correctly describe the plasma behavior.

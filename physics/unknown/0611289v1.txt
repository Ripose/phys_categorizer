It is suggested that the internal energy of the latent heat of vaporization is completely utilized by 
the atoms to overcome on the surface resistance of the liquid.  This energy can be calculated 
using a simple atomic model.  The theoretical values of the proposed model were compared to 
experimental data of monoatomic liquids (47 elements).  The found excellent agreement between 
the calculated and experimental values indicates that the proposed model correctly describes the 
physics of vaporization. 
 

The latent heat of vaporization is an extremely important physical process with many 
applications to chemistry, physics, and biology.  Thermodynamic defines the latent heat of 
vaporization  (

)vL as the energy which has to be supplied to the system in order to complete the 

liquid-vapor phase transformation.  At constant pressure the energy is absorbed at constant 
temperature.  The absorbed energy not just increases the internal energy of the system (U) but 
also used for the external work of the expansion (w). The latent heat of vaporization is then

where p is the pressure,

Several empirical and semi-empirical relationships are known for calculating the latent heat 
for the vaporization [1 and refs. therein]. Eventhough, there is no consensus on the exact physics, 
there is a general consensus that the surface energy must be an important part of the latent heat of 
vaporization.  The vaporization diminishes the surface energy of the liquid thus this energy must 
be supplied to the system. 

Laplace in his theory suggested that the ratio of the molar total surface energy and the molar 

internal latent heat is constant with respect to the temperature.  Weisskoph [2] determined the 
total surface area by slicing the substance at the linear dimension of one molecule and sum these 
surfaces.  According to Laplace’s theory the latent heat of vaporization should be calculated by 
multiplying the total surface area with the surface tension.  The calculated latent heat values of 
the model were in an order of magnitude agreement with experiments. 

Agrawal and Menon [3] proposed calculating the area for the surface tension as:

adding the work required for the volume expansion at the boiling temperature [Eq.(2)] to the 
internal energy [Eq.(4)].  The calculated latent heat values were compared to experiments of Li, 
Na, K, Rb, and Cs.  In order to reproduce the experiments the introduction of a multiplier

Based on speculations an atomic model is proposed to explain the physical phenomenon of 
the latent heat of vaporization.  The model allows calculating the energy for the latent heat of 
vaporization.  The theoretical values of the model will be compared to the experiments of 
monoatomic systems. 

 was necessary. 

The physical conditions are not uniform at atomic level in a liquid and distinction must be 
made between surface and inside atoms.  Atoms at the surface atoms are held together by the 
surface energy while the inside atoms can move freely.  The limited freedom of the tightly held 
surface atoms result that their thermal energy is more equalized than the thermal energy of the 
rest of the atoms inside the liquid.  The predicted probability distribution for the thermal energies 
of the atoms is shown on Fig. 1.  Based on the ‘wider’ energy distribution of the inner atoms 
these atoms have higher probability of escaping from the liquid than the atoms at the surface. 

The surface layer of the liquid is flexible.  If an inside atom with high energy hits the surface 

then the surface will absorb the energy through deformation. The maximum resistance of the 
deformed surface is achieved when the center of the out going atom reaches the plain of the 
surface (Fig. 2).  Beyond that maximum resistance the area of the surface starts to decrease and 
eventually leads to the detachment of the atom from the liquid. It is suggested that the extra 
energy, required for an atom to escape from the liquid, is equal with the maximum surface area 
resistance.  Assuming that the surface of the liquid contains one atomic layer then the maximum 
surface area [A] around an atom is:

where, r is the radius of the atoms.  Multiplying the maximum surface area with the number of 

moles [n], the Avogadro’s number [

AN ], and the surface tension at the boiling temperature gives 

the internal energy required for the vaporization.

The latent heat of vaporization is the sum of the internal energy Eq. (6) and the external work Eq.

Experimental data of monoatomic liquids have been used for the evaluation of Eq. (8).  The 
physical properties of the 47 elements used for the investigation are listed in Table 1.  Using the 
experimental latent heat values of vaporization the radius of the surface area was determined in 
atomic radius units.  With the exceptions of the elements in group 14 (C, Si, Ge, and Sn) and 18 
(Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) the calculated values are reasonable close to the theoretical value of 2r.  For the 
exceptions the average radius for the maximum surface area is 3.17r.  Possible explanation for 
this irregularity could be that the surface of these liquids contains two atomic layers.  The 
correlation coefficient for the remaining 39 elements with one surface layer is 0.9766, and the 
surface radius is 1.95r.   

The residuals of the latent heat of vaporization were plotted against the atomic radius and the 

surface tension (Fig. 3).  Based on visual inspection it can be concluded that there are only 
random errors present in both cases.  The lack of systematic error indicates that the proposed 
mathematical formula Eq. (8) does not require further modification or adjustment. 

The size of the investigated data set is sufficient for the evaluation of the proposed atomic 

model.  The observed excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental values 
indicates that the proposed atomic model correctly describes the physics of the latent heat of 
vaporization.

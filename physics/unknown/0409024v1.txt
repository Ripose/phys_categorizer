Abstract.    It  has  been  proved  theoretically  and  numerically  that  the  highly  relativistic 
electron beam can be accelerated efficiently via the Compton scattering induced by nonlinear 

Landau and cyclotron damping of the lower-hybrid waves. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
          Acceleration  and heating  of  a  relativistic  electron  beam  by  the  Compton  scattering  of 

electrostatic  waves  propagating  almost  perpendicularly  in  a  magnetized  plasma  are 

investigated  theoretically  and  numerically  on  the  basis  of  the  relativistic  kinetic  wave  and 
transport  equations1-5.    Two  electrostatic  waves  interact  nonlinearly  with  the  relativistic 
electron  beam,  satisfying  the  resonance  condition  for  the  Compton  scattering  (nonlinear 
Landau and cyclotron damping)4,5,

Abstract.  An explicit,  oscillatory solution of the type   r = [ro + Ao·sin(w ·t + f
is found for the zero-energy one-dimensional motion of a particle under a specific 
family of anharmonic potentials.

I.  The Potential

     In classical mechanics there are very few non-trivial potentials that admit an 
explicit analytical solution. Our aim in this paper is to present a new family of 
one-dimensional anharmonic potentials represented by the function:

for which one is able to find an analytical solution.

     In (1),  r  is  the  position  of  a  point-like  particle  of  mass  m; ro  and  Ao  are  
two independent  parameters, fulfilling  ro > Ao .  As  usual,  w   will  represent  the  
angular frequency  of  the  oscillatory  solutions;  -a-  is  a  free  non-null  parameter,  
and we will study  the  equation  of  the  oscillation  of  zero-energy  around  the  
minimum  of the potential.

     For a large enough r, V(r) is always confining.  If  a < 0 ,  the third term within the 
brackets  is  the  leader. If  a > 0 , then,  the  first  term  in  the  bracket  produces  a 
-parabolic-  confinement.  Our study will be devoted  to the analysis of the oscillations 
generated around the potential minimum,  which  has  at  its  right  the  confining  wall 
just mentioned.

     At  the  origin,  r = 0 ,  V(r)  can  exhibit  different  behaviours,  but  they  are  of  
no interest  here.

     Beyond the origin,  V(r)  has, in general, a  minimum,  at  r = R1 , and  a  maximum,  
at  r = R2 . These values are

     Note that  R1  always exists.  R2 , on the contrary,  is not real for  0 < a < 1 .

     The  oscillatory  motion  is  confined  to  the  region  where  V(r) < E .  Thus, for 
oscillations of  E = 0 , imposing the condition  V(r) = 0  we find:

where  RM  and  Rm  are the maximum  and  minimum  limiting  distances,  respectively. 
In all cases,  R2 < Rm < R1 < RM .

II.  Several Examples

     In the five cases depicted in Sections  II  and  III,  we  will  assume  that   m = 1 , 
w  = 10 ,  ro = 2  and  Ao = 1 .
     The purpose of these drawings is to give an idea of the several types of geometries 
included in Eq. (1).  In all cases the continuous line represents the potential, whilst the 
dotted straight line represents the  E = 0  level.

     Let us consider first  a = -1.1  (a < 0) .  This is illustrated in Fig. 1 .  Some  of  the

     In the third example,  a = 0.2  (0 < a < 1) .  This is plotted in Fig. 3 .  In this case, 
there is no maximum because  R2  in (3) is complex. Besides, we observe that the limit 
of V(0+) is infinite.

III.  Harmonic Behaviour

     We arrive at the harmonic limit, when we adopt  a = 1 .  This conduct is illustrated 
in Fig. 5 . The value of the other parameters is identical to that of the other figures.

      The form of the harmonic potential,  VH(r) ,  is

IV.  Oscillatory Solution

     To  find  the  general  solution of the oscillatory  motion,  of energy  E = 0 ,  in the 
interval between  Rm  and  RM , we  proceed,  in the usual way[1],  departing from the 
energy equation:

     In terms of s ,  -I-  adopts the form:

V.  Final Comments

     We have presented a new parametric family of anharmonic potentials for which one 
is able to obtain closed analytical solutions for the trajectories of zero-energy.

     The degree of anharmonicity is expressed by the departure of the exponent -a- 
from the value 1 .  Several illustrative examples have been provided.

Abstract:    Nonlocal  communication  between  two  laser  light  beams  is 
experimented in a photochromic polymer thin films. Information exchange 
between  the  beams  is  mediated  by  the  self-induction  of  a  surface  relief 
pattern. The exchanged information is related to the pitch and orientation of 
the grating. Both are determined by the incident beam. The process can be 
applied to experiment on a new kind of logic gates.

. Introduction 

1
 
There is still an open question concerning the possibility of using simple optics in replacement 
of the next generations of computers or at least to perform purely optical logic operations and 
calculations.  We  show  in  this  work  that  it  is  possible  to  implement  an  optical  network  and 
transfer information from one point to another point without overlapping of the light beams. 
Logical operations between the beams can also be performed. The optical-network model of 

computation  consists  in  many  elementary  processing  nodes  (neurons),  communicating  each 
other  with  interconnection  weights  [1,2].  Associated  with  each  node  is  an  activation  level 
which is transformed into a weighted sum of the activity levels of all the other nodes [3]. The 
node in our experiment is a surface induced relief grating (SRG) whose input is both the pitch 
and the orientation coded when the network is operated in the static mode. The grating which 
results  from  a  photodynamic  polymer  transport  process  is  produced  in  photoactive  polymer 
thin films with one single laser beam and shows regularly spaced surface relief structures [4–
6].  The  grating  spacing  and  orientation  can  be  controlled  by  the  incidence  angle  and 
polarization of the incident laser beam, respectively [7]. 

All the networking nodes can be activated simultaneously or sequentially by a laser beam 
with  sufficient  exposure  time  per  node.  The  neuron  output  is  then  the  acquisition  of  a 
polarization  state  and  grating  pitch,  and  subsequent  light  diffraction.  The  network  in  our 
system is a set of multiple SRG. We implement and test such system using the nonlocal self 
organization aspect of SRG under incoherent light power. Indeed, we reported previously in 
reference  [8]  that  when  we  send  a  low  intensity  coherent  seed  beam  simultaneously  with  a 
large  intensity  incoherent  pump  beam  on  the  photopolymer  surface,  a  SRG  is  induced  and 
propagates  all  over  the  incoherent  beam  area,  outside  of  the  coherent  beam:  it  bears  all  the 
features of the SRG induced by a large intensity coherent beam. We believe that our simple 
experimental  optical  processor  could  be  useful  to  implement  and  test  new  ideas  relevant  to 
neuronal photonics. 

2. Materials and methods 
 
Samples are polymer films made from a highly photoactive azobenzene derivative containing 
heterocyclic  sulfonamide  moieties:  3-[{4-[(E)-(4-{[(2,6-dimethylpyrimidin-4-yl)  amino] 
sulfonyl}phenyl) diazenyl]phenyl}-(methyl)amino]propyl 2-methylacrylate [9]. Thin films on 
glass  substrates  were  prepared  by  spin-coating  of  the  polymer  from  THF  solutions  with  a 
concentration of 50 mg/ml. Thickness measured with a Dektak-6M Stylus Profiler was around 
1μm. The  λ = 476.5 nm laser line of a continuous argon ion laser is used to excite the azo-
polymer close to its 438 nm-absorption maximum. Absorbance at the working wavelength is 
1.6.  Polarization  direction  of  the  laser  beam  is  varied  using  a  half-wave  plate.  Our 
experimental  set-up  is  sketched  in  Fig.  1.  Laser  power  is  500  mW.  The  beam  width  is 
increased to 5.8 mm by a two lenses afocal system. The beam is then divided in the two equal 
arms  of  a  Mach-Zehnder.  In  the  first  arm,  the  beam  is  reduced  to  a  width  w0  =  750  μm  by 
another afocal and is divided into two equal power spots. Power of each beam is attenuated 
down to 0.07 mW. These two narrow beams are the signal beams. The second one is the pump 
beam.  The  pump  beam  is  made  spatially  incoherent  by  focusing  the  laser  beam  through  a 
diffuser. It can also be made temporally incoherent with the signal beams using an additional 
delay  line  with  retardation  path  larger  than  the  5.7  cm-coherence  length  of  our  laser.  An 
additional  hot-air  gun  is  used  as  a  turbulent  layer  generator  and  is  inserted  along  the  beam 
path in order to insure total incoherence and depolarization. The diffuser and the turbulence 
generator  introduce  a  random  phase  which  varies  much  faster  than  the  time  constant  for 
grating formation in the sample. The signal and pump beams are spatially overlapped at the 
exit  of  the  Mach-Zehnder,  with  the  thinner  signal  beams  fixed  in  the  pump  beam  central 
region. They illuminate the polymer sample. Pump beam power is 87 mW.

. Experiments and discussion 
3
 
We  first  checked  the  material  response  for  the  coherent  signal  beams  alone,  without 
incoherent  pump  beam.  In  this  test,  the  signal  beams  are  not  attenuated,  their  power  is  0.6 
mW. The two beams are sent on the sample (Fig. 1) and the SRG is recorded after one hour 
illumination. The distance between the edges of the two w0 = 750 μm spots is fixed to d = 920 
μm. One of the beams (beam 1) has 32°-incidence angle and the other (beam 2) is normal to 
the sample surface. Both the height and pitch of the grating were retrieved after illumination 
with a contact-mode AFM. For beam 1, the grating pitch is Λ1 = 880 nm and for beam 2, Λ2 = 
590 nm,  both with  a  grating amplitude of  150  nm  ± 20 nm.  These  pitches  are  in agreement 
with  the  values  calculated  by  first  order  diffraction  at  an  angle  θ.  In  both  cases  the  pitch  is 
uniform in one direction and the two dimensional Fourier transforms in Fig. 2(a) show only 
one  single  spatial  frequency  component  νx  or  νy.  This  shows  that  the  two  beams  do  not 
interact.

Fig.  2.  Two  dimensional  Fourier  transform  of  the  two  SRG  spots  (A)  under  the  two  signal  beams  without  the 
incoherent pump. The same with the incoherent pump overlapping with the signal beams separated by a distance d = 
920 μm (B), d = 650 μm (C) and d = 450 μm (D). The SRGs under beams 1 and 2 have a pitch Λ1 = 880 nm and Λ2 = 
590 nm, respectively. The Fourier transform reflects the far field diffraction pattern of the SRG. 

In  a  second  step  the  87  mW  incoherent  pump  beam  overlaps  with  the  two  0.07  mW 
coherent signal beams. We check SRG construction for three different horizontal separations 
between the edges of the spots: 920, 650, and 450 μm, corresponding to a ratio w0/d of 1.6, 
1.15, and 0.8 respectively. Figure 2 shows the two dimensional Fourier transforms of the SRG 
below  beams  1  and  2.  When  the  two  spots  get  closer,  we  see  that  the  spatial  frequency 
spectrum  is  enlarged.  For  the  SRG  below  beam  1,  the  rotation  of  its  frequency  spectrum 
corresponds  to  the  mutual  interaction  with  beam  2.  We  see  the  same  rotation  in  a  reverse 
direction for beam 2, the two grating orientations becoming almost the same. When the two 
spots become closer (Fig. 2(d)), the two spatial frequency spectra become very similar. This 
shows that the two beams interact, the information on polarization is exchanged first at large 
distance and the information about the pitch is mixed, with appearance of new frequencies at 
shorter  distance.  Surface  profile  and  power  spectral  densities  (PSD)  of  these  images  are 
represented  in  Fig.  3  for  two  cross-sections  in  the  vertical  (blue  lines)  and  horizontal  (red 
lines)  directions  and  for  ratios  w0/d  of  1.7  and  0.8.  For  each  beam,  the  spatial  frequency 

corresponding to the original pitch is conserved, with additional frequencies appearing when 
the  separation distance  is  reduced.  For  the spot under  beam  1  the  horizontal  frequency  νx  = 
1/Λ2 appears in the power spectrum for the shortest separation. In the same way, for the spot 
under beam 2 the vertical frequency νy = 1/Λ1 appears in the power spectrum for the shortest 
separation.  The  numerical  criterion  for  appearance  of  a  new  spatial  frequency  is  chosen 
arbitrarily  in  our  experiment  as  being  a  peak  emerging  above  50%  in  the  normalized  PSD 
spectrum. That is the way the mutual influence between the 2 beams takes place.

Fig. 3. Power spectral density for different distances between the spots. PSD is measured for the vertical (blue lines) 
and horizontal (red lines) cross-sections of the SRG patterns under beam 1 (left) and 2 (right). Without coupling by 
the incoherent beam (A), coupled with 920 μm distance (B) and coupled with 650 μm distance (C). Inset in (A) shows 
the surface profile. Inset in (C) shows the AFM scan of a 20×20 µm2 region below the signal beams. 

A last experiment was performed with the half-wave plate placed on the path of beam 1 
and  its  polarization  fixed  at  45°.  Beam  2  polarization  is  vertical  as  given  by  the  laser.  The 
distance between the spots is reduced to d = 180 μm. A photodiode is set to measure the first 
order  which  would  be  diffracted  from  the  self-induced  SGR  by  a  beam  2  with  horizontal 
polarization. We must recall that the direction of diffraction follows the polarization direction 
[7],  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(a).  This  signal,  shown  in  Fig.  4,  is  the  transfer  of  polarization  from 
beam 1 to beam 2, associated with the new horizontal spatial frequency created beam 2 in Fig. 
3(c).  This  new  spatial  frequency  induces  the  horizontal  diffraction  which  is  detected  by  the 
photodiode.  The  signal  in  Fig.  4  saturates  after  100  minutes  of  illumination,  when  the 
information transfer is complete.

Fig. 4. First order diffraction intensity as a function of time for the coherent beam 2. Beam 1 polarization is fixed at 
45° and beam 2 polarization is vertical. The photodiode is set to measure the first order of diffraction from beam 2 in 
the horizontal direction. The signal detected is a signature of the polarization transfer from beam 1 to beam 2. 

Different nodes can be lighted up on the surface below the incoherent beam,. Associated 

with each SRG node i is its spatial Fourier spectrum described by a function 
where x

implemented  two  basic  logic  operation  in  our  simple  network  using  this  neuronal  principle. 
The  results  of  the  two  Boolean  operations  OR  and  AND  are  given  in  tables  1  and  2, 
respectively. In table 1, we consider the pitch of the SRG under beam 1 as test parameter y1. 
We assign the value 1 to the pitch of the SRG under the beam 1 which arrives alone at normal 

incidence. Any other SRG pitch will be assigned the value 0. The pitch 
 of the SRG is 
addressed by the beam incidence. The results in table 1 show that we implement an OR gate in 
this way.

In table 2, we consider the orientation of the SRG under beam 1 as test parameter y1. We 
assign the value 1 to a vertical orientation of the SRG under the beam 1 which arrives alone 
with vertical polarization. Any other orientation will be assigned the value 0. The orientation

logic operations. More complicated operations can be achieved if more signal beams interact 
within the incoherent beam at the polymer surface.

4. Conclusion 
 
We have implemented a very simple neurocomputer where the individual neuron is the self-
induced SRG below a coherent signal beam. In this experiment, the network is configured in 
the static mode and each neuron is configured by the photoinduced polymer transport process. 
The  neurons  interact  through  the  self-induced  SRG  which  dissipate  the  strong  incoherent 
pump beam. The learning process of each neuron consists in the acquisition of the pitch and 
polarization parameters. The result of the activation is processed from the weighted sum of the 
activity levels of the individual neurons. This basic implementation can be extended to a more 
complex  network  structure.  For  instance,  a  large  number  of  nodes  can  be  implemented  in  a 
single  polymer  film  under  incoherent  illumination.  The  neurons  can  also  interact  between 
several  cascaded  planes  as  each  individual  neuron  bears  an  underlying  SRG  which  diffracts 
efficiently  in  privileged  directions  [7].  The  process  is  partly  reversible:  work  is  now  in 
progress  to  exploit  the  dynamic  reconfiguration  of  the  network  (more  than  n  =  1  iteration) 
which is permitted as long as saturated growth of the SRG is not achieved [7]. Work is also in 
progress to improve the time response of the system using faster responsive polymers. We see 
that  our  simple  experiment  on  optical  processing  is  relevant  to  the  implementation  and 
evaluation of new concepts related to neuronal photonics.

Abstract—  A  novel  class  of  circular  resonators,  based  on  a 
radial defect surrounded by Bragg reflectors, is studied in detail. 
Simple  rules  for  the  design  and  analysis  of  such  structures  are 
derived  using  a  transfer  matrix  formalism.  Unlike  conventional 
ring resonators, annular Bragg resonators (ABR) are not limited 
by  the  total  internal  reflection  condition,  and  can  exhibit  both 
large  free  spectral  ranges  and  low  bend  losses.  The  Bragg 
reflection  mechanism  enables  the  confinement  of  light  within  a 
defect consisting of a low refractive index medium (such as air). 
Strong  atom-photon  interaction  can  be  achieved  in  such  a 
structure, making it a promising candidate for sensing and cavity 
QED  applications.  For  sensing  applications,  we  show  that  the 
ABR  structure  can  possess  significantly  higher  sensitivity  when 
compared to a conventional ring resonator sensor. Lasing action 
and  low  threshold  levels  are  demonstrated  in  ABR  lasers  at 
telecommunication wavelengths under pulsed optical pumping at 
room  temperatures.  The  impact  of  the  intensity  and  dimensions 
of the pump-spot on the emitted spectrum is studied in detail.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

THE past few years have witnessed a significant increase in 

research involving circular optical resonators. Resonators 
are  key  elements  for  various  applications  such  as  optical 
communication  systems  [1-6]  and  biochemical  sensing  [7,8], 
as  well  as  for  basic  research  such  as  single  molecule 
spectroscopy  [9]  and  cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) 
[10,11]  with  possible  applications  in  quantum  information 
technologies. 

resonators  have  a 

For many of these applications, resonators that exhibit low 
losses  (high  Q-factor)  are  required.  Particularly  for  sensing 
applications  and  for  cavity  QED,  it  is  also  often  desired  that 
the 
small  modal  volume.  These 
characteristics  are  required  in  order  to  attain  strong  atom-
photon  interaction  and  to  probe  as  small  a  modal-volume  as 
possible.  For  telecommunication  applications,  a  large  free 
spectral  range  (FSR)  is  often  desired,  which  requires  the 
resonators to be of small dimensions. 

Circular  resonators  based  on  total  internal  reflection  (TIR) 
that  exhibit  the  combination  of  both  high  Q-factor  and  small

dimensions are difficult to realize, because these attributes are 
mutually  contradicting.  To  have 
large  FSR,  a  small 
circumference  and  bending  radius  are  required.  Under  such 
conditions, the efficiency of the TIR confinement mechanism 
is significantly reduced, leading to larger power radiation and 
lower Q-factors due to bending losses [12]. 

Photonic  crystal  (PC)  cavities  have  been  extensively 
studied  for  high  Q  cavity  applications.  PC  cavities  with  Q-
factors approaching ~106 were predicted numerically [13], and 
Qs  of  up  to  4.5x104  were  demonstrated  experimentally  [14]. 
Nevertheless,  these  resonators  consist  primarily  of  a  defect 
(either  point  or  line),  which  does  not  necessarily  support  a 
(WGM)  solution  and  are, 
whispering-gallery-mode-like 
therefore,  difficult  to  couple  to  conventional  waveguides. 
Hexagonal  (non  circular)  cavities  incorporating  120°  abrupt 
bends,  which  can  be  easily  coupled  to  PC  line  defect 
waveguides,  have  also  been  proposed  and  studied  [15]. 
However, abrupt bends have been shown to support localized 
bound states [11] which might lase in addition to the desired 
WGM. 

Recently, we proposed utilizing Bragg reflection instead of 
TIR  as  the  radial  confinement  mechanism  [16].  This  concept 
is  illustrated  in  Fig  1:  A  circumferentially  guiding  defect  is 
located  within  a  medium  which  consists  of  annular  Bragg 
layers.  Resonators  of  this  class,  known  as  annular  Bragg 
resonators  (ABR),  are  designed  to  support  azimuthally 
propagating  modes,  with  energy  concentrated  within  the 
defect  region by radial Bragg reflection. Unlike conventional 
resonators,  the  reflectivity  of  the  Bragg  mirrors  can  be 
increased simply by adding more layers. As a result, the radius 
of the defect, and therefore the modal volume, can be reduced 
significantly without increasing the bending losses.  

Disk  and  ring  resonators  based  on  distributed  Bragg 
reflection  have  been  analyzed  previously  for  both  laser  and 
passive  resonator  applications,  employing  various  techniques 
such  as  conformal  mapping,  a  coupled-mode  approach  and 
field transfer-matrices [17-24]. 

In  this  paper  we  explore  theoretically  and  experimentally 
the  properties  of  ABRs.  In  section  II  we  briefly  review  the 
theoretical  framework  and  the  rules  for  the  design  and 
analysis  of  the  resonators.  In  section  III  we  study  the 
advantages of the ABR structure for various applications, and

A.  Theoretical Framework 
We  consider  an  azimuthally  symmetric  structure  as 
illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The  guiding  defect,  which  consists  of  a 
material  with  refractive 
is  surrounded  by 
distributed  Bragg  reflectors on both sides where the reflector 
layers  are  of  refractive

electromagnetic  field  components  can  be  expressed  by  the  z 
components  of  the  electrical  and  magnetic  fields  [25]  which 
satisfy the Helmholtz equations: 


where  ρ,  z  and  θ  are  the  radial,  axial  and  azimuthal 
coordinates respectively and k0 is the wavenumber in vacuum. 
The refractive index n(ρ) equals either n1, n2 or ndef depending 
on the radius ρ. Assuming the dependence of the fields on the 
coordinates  can  be  separated,  the  radial  part  of  the  fields 
(either Hz or Ez), RH,E, must satisfy the Bessel equation:

In the limit of strong vertical confinement (i.e., β<<kj) it is 
possible to separate the modal field solutions into two distinct 
polarizations:  TE  consisting  of  Hz,  Eρ  and  Eθ  and  TM 
consisting  of  Ez,  Hρ  and  Hθ.  Unlike  [16]  we  adopt  the 
polarization convention of planar optics. 

In the above mentioned limit, each polarization component 
can  be  described  by  two  coefficients  in  each  layer:  Aj  and  Bj 
for  TM  and  Cj  and  Dj  for  TE.  For  each  polarization,  the 
boundary  conditions  at  the  interfaces  between  successive 
layers can be represented similarly to (4) using simplified 2X2

Using  relation  (4)  and 

the  field 
components can be “propagated” from the inner layers to the 
external  layers.  We  use  the  finiteness  of  the  field  at ρ=0  so 
that  B1=  D1=0.  The  second  boundary  condition  is  no  inward 
propagating field beyond the last layer, so that BN+1=-iAN+1 for 
TM and CN+1=-iDN+1 for TE, where N is the number of layers.

rings.  However,  we  are

It  has  been  shown  that  the  best  strategy  to  attain  an 
exponential decrease (or increase) in the field intensity in the 
grating region is to position the interfaces of the layers at the 
zeros  and  extrema  of  the  z  component  of  the  field  [26].  The 
index profile and the field are calculated simultaneously, using 
the  index  to  find  the  field  and  the  field  to  determine  the 
position of the interfaces.

(Cartesian)  Bragg  reflector.  The  optimal  Cartesian  Bragg 
reflector  can  be  designed  in  a  similar  way,  leading  to  layers 
that  are  quarter-wavelength  thick  [27].  Here  the  resulting 
layers are also “quarter-wavelength” thick but in the sense of 
the quasi-periodicity of the mth order Bessel function [28]. The 
defect  (again,  as  in  the  Cartesian  case)  should  be  “half-
wavelength”  wide,  i.e.  its  interfaces  should  be  located  at 
successive zeros of the field. 

In order to attain a transverse field profile which is confined 
within  the  defect,  the  profile  must  exponentially  increase  for 
ρ <ρdef,  and  exponentially  decrease 
for  ρ >ρdef.  This 
requirement determines which index-interfaces (low→high or 
high→low)  should  be  positioned  at  zeros  of  the  field  and 
which at the extrema of the field. The constraints on the index

profile are similar to the Cartesian case and differ for the TE 
and  TM  polarizations  [26].  For  the  TE  polarization,  the 
interfaces  for  increasing  (decreasing)  field  should  be  at  the 
zeros  (extrema)  of  Hz  if  n(ρ -)  >  n(ρ +) at the interface and at 
the extrema (zeros) of Hz if n(ρ -) < n(ρ +) at the interface. For 
the TM polarization the interfaces for increasing (decreasing) 
field should be at the extrema (zeros) of Ez if n(ρ -) > n(ρ +) at 
the interface and at the zeros (extrema) of Ez if n(ρ -) < n(ρ +) 
at the interface. The interfaces of the defect must be located at 
zeros of Hz for TE and of Ez for TM. 
 

C.  Mode Profile 
Figure 2 depicts the refractive index (Fig. 2(a)) and the TE 
modal  field  (Fig.  2(b))  profiles  of  an  ABR  designed  for  a 
0.55µm  thick  InGaAsP  layer  suspended  in  air.  The  device  is 
designed  to  have  a  mode  with  an  angular  propagation 
coefficient  of  m=7  at  λres=0.852µm.  The  effective  index 
approximation in the vertical dimension is used to reduce the 
3D  problem  to  a  2D  equivalent  one.  As  can  be  seen  in  the 
figure,  the  field  is  primarily  confined  in  the  defect  and  it 
decays while oscillating in the Bragg reflectors. 

To verify the validity of the effective index approximation 
we  simulate  the  device  using  an  angular  finite-difference-
time-domain  (FDTD)  scheme  which  takes  advantage  of  the 
azimuthal symmetry to reduce the computational domain [29]. 
For a given m, the method can be used to find the resonance 
wavelength,  the  quality  factor  and  the  modal  field  profile  of 
any circular device. 

Figure  3  depicts  a  comparison  between  the  field  profiles 
calculated  by  the  FDTD  simulation  and  by  the  2D  transfer 
matrix  formalism.  There  is  good  agreement  between  the  two 
approaches.  The  resonance  wavelength  found  by  the  FDTD 
simulations  is  0.85µm  and  the  ratio  between  Hz  and  Ez  is 
25dB,  indicating  that  the  modal  field  is  primarily  TE 
polarized. 

Due  to  the  different  radial  confinement  mechanism,  the 
characteristics  of  the  ABR  modal  field  differ  significantly 
from those of the mode of a conventional resonator. First, the 
radial  position  of  the  maximal  intensity  of  the  field  can  be 
predetermined  regardless  of  wavelength  and  material  system. 
Second,  low  angular  propagation  coefficients  (m)  and  tight 
bending  radius  can  be  realized  because  there  is  no  need  to 
satisfy a TIR condition. Finally, the field can be confined in a 
lower  refractive  index  layer,  giving  rise  to  a  larger  FSR  or 
enhanced sensitivity for sensing application (see section III).

A.  Sensing 
Of special interest is the possibility to confine the light in a 

defect consisting of low refractive index medium (such as air), 
which  can  be  used  to  attain  strong  interaction  between  the 
cavity  photons  and  any  desired  material.  This  characteristic 
can  be  used  to  realize  sensitive  and  compact  sensors,  which 
are  able  to  detect  small  quantities  and  low  concentrations  of 
analyte. 

Among 

the  most 

approaches 

straightforward 

for 
optoelectronic (bio)chemical sensing is to detect the change in 
the refractive index or the absorption caused by the presence 
of  a  (bio)chemical  agent.  Several  schemes  have  been 
suggested  to  detect  these  types  of  changes,  employing 
directional  couplers  [30],  Mach-Zehnder 
interferometers 
(MZI)  [31]  or  high-Q  optical  resonators  [7].  The  detection 
mechanism underlying these sensors is the modification of the 
phase  accumulation  rate  (i.e.,  the  propagation  coefficient)  of 
the  field  due  to  the  interaction  of  the  evanescent  tail  of  the 
field with the analyte.  

The primary disadvantage of these detection methods is that 
the  interaction  of  the  field  with  the  surrounding  environment 
is  weak,  and  therefore,  the  influence  of  the  analyte  on  the 
propagation  coefficient  is  small.  As  a  result,  achieving  high 
sensitivity  requires  large  interaction  length  leading  to  the 
interferometers  and  very  high-Q 
requirement  of 
resonators.  In  addition,  the  MZI-type  sensors  might  have 
difficulties  detecting  small  numbers  (or  single)  molecules, 
regardless of their length. 

long 

On the other hand, the ABR structure and mode profile (see 
Fig. 2) allow for the interaction of the non-evanescent part of 
the field, especially when the device is designed to include an 
air  defect.  As  a  result,  ABR-based  sensors  are  expected  to 
offer  significantly  enhanced  sensitivity  compared  to  sensors 
that  are  based  on  conventional  resonators  of  similar 
dimensions and materials.  

Figure  4  shows  a  comparison  between  the  shifts  of  the 
resonance  frequency  of  an  ABR  and  a  conventional  ring 
resonator  due  to  changes  in  the  refractive  index  of  the 
surroundings.  The  ABR  consists  of  alternating  layers  with 
refractive  indices  of  1.545  and  1.0  and  an  air  defect.  The 
conventional  resonator  consists  of  n=1.545  core  surrounded 
by  air  cladding.  Both  resonators  are  approximately  16µm  in 
diameter  and  designed  to  resonate  in  the  visible  wavelength 
regime. The sensitivity of each device is indicated by the slope 
of  the  curves  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  resonance  wavelength  of 
the conventional ring resonator shifts by approximately 0.007 
nm for an increase of 10-3 in the refractive index. For the same 
index  change,  the  Bragg  resonator’s  resonance  wavelength 
shifts by 0.4 nm, i.e., the ABR exhibits higher sensitivity by a 
factor of 60. 

B.  Telecommunication 
Properties  such  as  large  FSR  and  high  Q  are  essential  for 
any  resonator-based  telecom  application,  especially  filters, 
add/drop multiplexers, and optical delay lines [1-6], as well as 
for low threshold lasers. 

One  of  the  interesting  differences  between  ABRs  and 
conventional resonators is the in-plane coupling mechanism to 

SCHEUER et al.: InGaAsP annular Bragg lasers: theory, applications and modal properties 
 

4

other devices. While in a conventional resonator the coupling 
is  evanescent,  the  coupling  between  ABRs  is  direct  (i.e., 
radiative)  –  similar  to  the  coupling  between  PC  waveguides 
and defect cavities [32-35]. The radiative coupling mechanism 
has some advantages and drawbacks compared to evanescent 
coupling.  The  main  advantage  is  that  the  coupling  can  be 
determined  precisely  according  to  the  number  of  Bragg 
reflection layers. The drawback is that the resonator cannot be 
directly  coupled  to  an  in-plane  conventional  waveguide  (i.e., 
TIR based), but only to a waveguide also possessing a suitably 
designed  periodic  structure,  such  as  a  transverse  Bragg 
resonance waveguide [36]. 

Nevertheless,  direct  coupling  to  a  conventional  waveguide 
is  possible  by  employing  a  vertical  coupling  scheme. 
Moreover, direct in-plane coupling to other ABRs is possible, 
thus allowing for structures comprising Bragg-reflection based 
elements  in  one  layer  and  conventional  I/O  waveguides  in 
another  (see  Fig.  5).  Such  a  configuration  is  useful  for  the 
realization  of  devices  that  require  precise  coupling  such  as 
coupled-resonator-optical-waveguide 
(CROW)  delay-lines 
and lasers [36,37]. 

 

IV.  FABRICATION 

To examine the spectral and spatial properties of the optical 
modes  supported  by  the  ABR  structure,  we  employed  high 
index-contrast  radial  Bragg  gratings  fabricated  in  active 
semiconductor  material.  The  semiconductor  medium  consists 
of a 250 nm thick InGaAsP layer (n ≈ 3.35 at λ = 1.55 µm) on 
top of an InP substrate. The InGaAsP layer includes six 75 Å 
InGaAsP  quantum  wells 
wide  compressively  strained 
positioned  at 
the  center,  with  peak  photoluminescence 
occurring at 1559nm. 

The fabrication process is illustrated in Fig. 6. First, a SiO2 
etch mask layer is deposited by PECVD (a). Then, a layer of 
PMMA  electron  beam  resist  is  applied  by  spin-coating  (b). 
The  desired  geometry  is  then  defined  using  a  direct  electron 
beam  writer  operating  at  100  kV  (c).  After  the  resist  is 
developed,  the  PMMA  patterns  are  transferred  into  the  SiO2 
etch  mask  layer  by  inductively  coupled  plasma  reactive  ion 
etching  (ICP-RIE)  using  C4F8  plasma  (d).  The  remaining 
PMMA  is  removed  with  a  gentle  isotropic  O2  plasma  step. 
The SiO2 layer serves as a hard mask for pattern transfer into 
the  active  InGaAsP  layer,  using  an  ICP-RIE  etch  employing 
HI/Ar chemistry [39] (e). The patterns are etched to a depth of 
~  325nm,  completely  penetrating  the  active  membrane.  The 
remaining  SiO2  hard  mask  is  then  stripped  in  a  buffered 
hydrofluoric acid solution.  

To  achieve  strong  vertical  confinement,  the  InGaAsP 
membrane must be clad by low-index material both above and 
below. An epitaxial layer transfer technique [40], using a UV-
curable optical adhesive (Norland Products NOA 73), is used 
to  flip-bond 
to  a 
transparent  sapphire  substrate  (f).  Subsequently,  the  InP 
substrate  is  removed  by  mechanical  polishing  and  selective 
wet  chemical  etching,  leaving  the  250nm  thick  patterned

InGaAsP  membrane  embedded  in  the  cured  adhesive  (g). 
Finally,  the  adhesive  filling  the  trenches  is  removed  with  an 
isotropic  NF3/O2  ICP-RIE  etch  (h).  Fig  7  depicts  scanning 
electron  microscope  (SEM)  images  of  an  ABR  device  at 
various stages of the fabrication.  

Since the optical emission and gain from the compressively 
strained quantum wells favor TE-polarized electric fields [41], 
the  design  of  the  fabricated  devices  is  optimized  for  this 
polarization.  In  order  to  simplify  the  design  calculations,  we 
employ  the  effective  index  approximation  in  the  vertical 
dimension.  An  effective  index  neff  =  2.8  is  found  by  solving 
for  the  TE-polarized  mode  of  the  transferred  InGaAsP  slab. 
To facilitate the fabrication of the device, a mixed Bragg order 
scheme is used, with second-order (3λ/4 ~ 430nm) high-index 
layers and first-order (λ/4 ~ 400nm) low-index layers. 

In addition to relaxing the fabrication tolerances, the mixed 
Bragg  order  implementation  induces  a  coherent  diffraction 
component  in  the  vertical  direction  [15].  Although  this 
mechanism  reduces  the  overall  Q  of  the  cavity,  it  facilitates 
the observation and measurement of the resonator emission. 

 

V.  EXPERIMENTS 

The  near-field  (NF)  intensity  pattern  and  the  emitted 
spectrum  of  the  ABRs  are  examined  at  room  temperature 
under  pulsed  optical  pumping.  Figure  8  depicts 
the 
experimental setup used to characterize the fabricated devices. 
The  pump  beam  is  focused  on  the  sample  with  a  50X 
objective lens. The position of this lens is used to control the 
size and the position of the pump spot. A 20X objective lens is 
used  to  collect  the  vertical  emission  from  the  sample  and  to 
focus it on an IR camera to obtain the NF intensity pattern and 
to  couple  the  light  into  a  multi-mode  fiber  to  obtain  the 
emitted spectrum. 

The  resonators  are  pumped  by  pulsed  optical  excitation, 
using  a  mode-locked  Ti:sapphire  laser  emitting  ~  120fs 
FWHM pulses at a repetition rate of 76.6MHz, with a center 
wavelength of λp=890nm. The pump beam incidents normal to 
the  plane  of  the  devices  under  test.  When  the  un-patterned 
QW  layer  structure  is  pumped,  the emitted spectrum consists 
of a wide peak centered at 1559nm. As the pumping power is 
increased  from  1mw 
the 
to  20mW, 
luminescence  broadens  from  approximately  70nm  to  110nm, 
and  the  peak  of  the  photoluminescence  shifts  towards  longer 
wavelength  due  to  heating.  No  significant  shift  is  observed 
when the pump power is below 5mW, indicating that heating 
is of less significance at these pump levels. 

the  FWHM  of 

When  an  ABR  is  pumped,  the  emission  characteristics 
change  significantly.  While  the  specific  details  (threshold 
levels, emitted wavelengths, etc.) vary from device to device, 
the overall behavior is similar. Once a certain pump intensity 
threshold  is  exceeded,  clear  and  narrow  (~0.5nm  FWHM) 
emission  lines  appear  in  the  spectrum  (see  Fig.  9).  As  the 
pump intensity is increased, the intensity of the emission lines 
towards  shorter 
increase  as  well  and 

they  broaden

wavelengths. Increasing the pump power further results in the 
appearance of additional emission lines. 

Figure 9 shows the lasing characteristics at different pump 
levels  of  an  ABR  consisting  of  5  internal  and  10  external 
Bragg layers and a half-wavelength wide defect. The radius of 
the  defect  is  approximately  5µm.  At low pump levels, below 
0.75mW, only a single emission line at 1.595µm is visible (the 
device was design to have a resonance wavelength at 1.6µm). 
As the pump level is increased, additional resonances at both 
lower  and  shorter  wavelength  appear  although  the  peak  at 
1.595µm  remains  the  dominant  one.  The  inset  of  Fig.  9 
depicts  the  integrated  emitted  power  from  the  lasers  vs.  the 
pump 
threshold  at 
Ppump=680µW. Although the laser was designed for a specific 
mode Fig. 9 indicates the existence of additional lasing modes. 
The  existence  of  these  modes  stem  from  the  combination  of 
the  large  index  contrast  between  the  Bragg  layers,  which 
generated an effective radial “bandgap”, and the use of three-
quarter-wavelength  layers  consisting  of  high-index  material, 
which  effectively  elongate  the  defect  circumference.  As  a 
result, the device also supports additional radial and azimuthal 
modes. However, because the radial index profile is optimized 
to  a  specific  modal  field  profile,  these  additional  modes  are 
lossier and thus their threshold pump levels are higher. 

indicating  a  clear 

lasing 

level, 

We also studied the impact of the pump-spot dimensions on 
the  emission  characteristics.  By  changing  the  size  of  the 
pumped  area  it  is  possible  to  selectively  excite  the  resonant 
modes of the cavity according to their radial profile. Figure 10 
shows measured spectra from the same device as that of Fig. 
9,  for  increasing  pump-spot  diameters.  The  pump  level  is 
maintained  constant  at  1.2mW.  Thus,  as  the  pump  spot  is 
increased  the  pump  density  decreases  at  the  center  of  the 
device  and  increases  in  the  periphery,  effectively  scanning 
over  the  resonator  area.  As  the  pump-spot  is  broadened, 
spectral  features  having  longer  wavelength  and  smaller  FSR 
appear, with the most prominent transition occurring between 
10µm and 11µm diameter pump-spots. 

We assume that resonances that appear at larger pump-spots 
peak at larger radii within the device. Under this assumption, 
the  resonance  frequencies  of  the  device  can  be  categorized 
into  three  distinct  groups  according  to  their  radial  profile. 
These  groups,  marked  as  “S”,  “M”  and  “L”,  are  located  at 
small, medium and large radii respectively (see Fig. 10). The 
insets of Fig. 10 show the IR emission pattern from the ABR 
at  pump-spot  diameters  of  9.6µm  and  11.1µm.  The  emitted 
pattern at Dpump=9.6µm consists of two bright rings: an inner 
ring  with  an  angular  propagation  coefficient  of  m=3,  and  an 
outer  ring  whose  angular  propagation  coefficient  cannot  be 
resolved.  The  outer  ring  is  located  at  the  radial  defect  of  the 
device. We attribute these modes to the strongest peaks in the 
corresponding spectrum at λ=1595nm and at λ=1615nm. The 
pattern at Dpump=11.1µm includes the inner ring with m=3 but 
does not exhibit the outer ring observed for the smaller pump-
spot.  Since  wider  pump-spots  are  associated  with  longer 
wavelength  we  infer  that  the  inner  ring  corresponds  to 

that 

the  defect  mode  corresponds 

λ=1615nm  and 
to 
λ=1595nm. As can be expected, the pattern at Dpump=11.1µm 
is  wider  than  the  one  at  Dpump=9.6µm,  and  exhibits  modes 
which are located at larger radii. 

VI.  DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY 

We  have  studied,  experimentally  and  theoretically,  the 
characteristics  of  a  novel  class  of  lasers  that  are  based  on 
radial  Bragg  reflectors.  Lasing  action  with  low  threshold 
levels  are  demonstrated  at  room  temperature  under  pulsed 
optical  pumping.  The  observed  Q  factors  are  between  1000 
and 2000. 

By  changing  the  pump-spot  diameter  we  find  that  longer 
resonance wavelengths correspond to patterns with larger radii 
for the specific structure presented here. For this device, it is 
possible 
the  resonance 
wavelengths and the observed IR patterns, and to identify one 
of the defect-modes. 

to  correlate  between  some  of 

Such  lasers  sources  are  ideally  suited  to  the  detection  of 
small  changes  in  the  modal  effective  index  or  the  Q  factor, 
and for achieving strong atom-field coupling. In addition, our 
cavity  can  easily  be  integrated  with  other  photonic  devices 
such as photonic crystals and distributed feedback lasers.

ABSTRACT 

Using  an  elementary  wave  optics  and  the  principles  of  special  relativity,  we  give  an  alternative 

approach  to  the  problem  of  relativistic  aberration  of  light.  We  investigate  the  case  of  a  plane-

polarized  light  beam  emanating  from  a  uniformly  moving  light  source.  We  emphasize  that  the 

standard  formula  for  relativistic  aberration  describes  the  aberration  of  the  path  taken  by  a  single 

wavefront, but not the aberration of the path taken by the whole light beam. We further derive the 

relations  that  give  a  complete  description  of  the  aberration  phenomenon.  We  conclude  that  the 

approach in this paper shows that the relativistic aberration is a direct consequence of the relativity of 

simultaneity.

Relativistic  aberration  of  light  is  a  physical  effect  commonly  defined  as  a  change  of  the 

direction  of  a  light  ray  when  observed  from  different  inertial  reference  frames.  It  is  usually,  and 

sometimes incorrectly, discussed in the context of stellar aberrations [1]. The traditional derivation of 

the  formula  for  relativistic  aberration  involves  a  plane-polarized  electromagnetic  wave  and  the 

requirement that its phase is an invariant quantity under a Lorentz transformation [2, 3]. The formula 

also can be obtained by a direct application of the addition law for relativistic velocities [4]. The aim 

of  this  paper  is  to  give  a  simple  and  intuitive  approach  to  the  problem,  and  to  point  out  some 

important misconceptions usually present in the standard textbooks on relativity. 

 

As a simple two-dimensional model of a plane-wave emitter we use a linear array of identical 

coherent elementary sources that begin to radiate spherical wavelets simultaneously with respect to 

the reference frame where the array is at rest. A special case of a horizontal line source is depicted in 

Fig.  1.  A  simple  Huygens’  construction  would  show  that  this  idealized  line  source  will  emit  plane 

wavefronts perpendicularly to its axis. However, the situation will be different when the line source 

is moving at a constant velocity v to the right (see Fig. 2). Let A and B denote the elementary sources 

that lie on the rear and the front of the line source, respectively, and 

l =

AB

 the length of the moving 

line source. Due to the motion of the line source, the elementary sources along the line source will 

not  flash  simultaneously,  but  there  will  be  a  certain  time  interval  between  the  beginning  of  the 

emission  of  any  two  elementary  sources.  Thus,  if  the  elementary  sources  A  and  B  started  to  emit 

wavelets simultaneously in the reference frame where the line source is at rest, then, in the reference 

frame where the line source is moving at a constant velocity v to the right (Fig. 2), the elementary 

source at the front will start radiating wavelets ∆tAB seconds after the flash of the elementary source 

at the rear. The time interval ∆tAB between the emission of the elementary sources from the rear and 
the front of the line source is given by

where  c  is  the  speed  of  light  in  vacuum.  The  derivation  of  Eq.  (1)  can  be  achieved  by  making  a 

simple analogy with Einstein’s thought experiment in which the opposite ends of the train are hit by 

strokes of lightning by simply substituting the strokes with two identical elementary sources, one at 

each end of the train [5]. During the time interval ∆tAB taken from the beginning of the radiation of 

the source at A, the source at B has moved a distance

 to the right. At the end of this time 

interval ∆tAB, the source at the front (now, at the point B′) will begin to radiate, and the elementary 

wavefront  radiated  from  A  a  time  ∆tAB  earlier  will  be  a  sphere  with  radius 

AC

.  The

wavefront  BC ′   emitted  by  the  line  source  is  an  envelope  of  the  spherical  wavelets  radiated  by  the 

point  sources  along  BA ′ .  We  have  taken  into  account  the  constant  light  speed  postulate,  which 
implies that the elementary wavefront radiated by a moving elementary source will represent a sphere 

expanding in all directions at a constant speed c.  

From Fig. 2 we see that the wavefront  BC ′  will propagate at a speed c at an angle θ from the 

vertical. From the triangle AB′C the angle θ can be expressed as

which is the well-known formula that commonly describes the aberration of the transverse light ray 

in the Michelson-Morley apparatus [6]. 

 

Now, consider the case when the line source is inclined at an angle θ0 to the horizontal with 
respect to the reference frame where the line source is at rest (Fig. 3). Evidently, the line source will 

emit plane wavefronts at an angle θ0 from the vertical. In the reference frame where the line source is 

moving at a constant velocity v to the right (see Fig. 4), its inclination angle θ1 will differ from its 

inclination angle θ0 in the stationary case due to the effect of Lorentz contraction along the direction 
of its motion. It is easy to show that this tilt of the moving line source is given with

sources along the line source which simultaneously started their radiation in its rest reference frame 

will not flash simultaneously in the reference frame where the line source is moving. We left to the 

reader  as  an  exercise  to  show  that  the  time  interval  ∆tAB  elapsed  between  the  flashes  of  the 
elementary sources from the rear and the front of the moving line source is given with

We  take  into  account  that  the  elementary  source  at  the  front  will  start  radiating  spherical  wavelets

Equation (11) expresses the law of aberration in its most general form. It can be easily shown that it 

is identical to the formula obtained with the standard methods [2, 3, 4]. Obviously, in the case θ0 = 0, 
Eq. (11) reduces to Eq. (3). 

We would like to stress that Eq. (11) (and, therefore, Eq. (3)) describes the aberration of the 

path taken by a single wavefront, but not the aberration of the path taken by the light beam [7]. The 

formula  for  the  aberration  of  the  path  of  the  light  beam  can  be  derived  by  considering  Fig.  5.  We 
have two plane wavefronts subsequently emitted by the moving light source from the points A1 and 
A2. The light source is moving at a constant velocity v to the right. Let ∆t be the time interval elapsed 
between the emission of the wavefronts. The wavefronts will follow two separate paths determined 

by the aberration angle θ in Eq. (11) at a constant speed c. During the time interval ∆t between the 

emission  of  the  wavefronts,  the  light  source  has  traveled  the  path

an advancement

 as a whole at velocity v to the right. Observe that the plane of every propagating 

wavefront  is  perpendicular  to  the  wavefront’s  path  determined  by  the  angle θ,  but  not  to  the  axis 

along which the light beam advances. The angle δ that describes the axis of the light beam can be 

found from the triangle

Equations (11), (15) and (17) give a complete description of the propagation of the light beam from a 

uniformly moving source [8]. We emphasize that although the light beam will advance at velocity u 

at an angle δ from the vertical, at the same time the entire light beam (i. e. the axis of the light beam 

determined by δ) will move at velocity v to the right (see Fig. 6). 

From the above discussion, we may conclude that relativistic aberration of light is a corollary 

of  relativity  of  simultaneity.  As  a  subject  for  future  study,  we  left  to  the  reader  to  explore  the 

situations when the elementary sources are arranged in a more complicated manner. For example, an 

interesting  case  occurs  when  the  point  sources  are  arranged  around  a  circle,  which  represents  a 

simple model of a spherical wave emitter.

,  which  describe  the  aberration  of  the  vertical  light  beam  in  Einstein’s  cat 

experiment  discussed  in  Ref.  7.  Another  interesting  example  occurs  in  the  case  of  a  vertical  line 

source (θ0 = π/2). In this case, sinθ = 1, δ = π/2, and u = c − v, which means that the light beam will 
advance from the moving light source in the same direction as in the case of a stationary light source, 

but at a speed (c − v) which is smaller than the speed of light in vacuum. The result, however, will 

not  contradict  the  constant  light  speed  postulate  if  we  take  into  account  that  at  the  same  time  the 

entire light beam is moving at velocity v to the right. Thus, the motion of the light beam at velocity v 

in the direction of motion of the light source combined with the advancement of the beam at velocity 

(c − v) in the same direction will give a net constant speed c to every wavefront along the beam.

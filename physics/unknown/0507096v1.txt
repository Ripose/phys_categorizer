Abstract 
 

Dusty plasmas consists of an ionized gas containing small (usually negatively 

charged) particles. Dusty plasmas are of interest in both astrophysics and space 
physics as well as in research in plasma processing and nanofabrication. In this work, 
the formation of plasma crystals confined in an external one-dimensional parabolic 
potential well is simulated for a normal experimental environment employing a 
computer code called BOX_TREE. Such crystals are layered systems, with each layer 
a two dimensional lattice composed of grain particles. The number of layers is 
dependent upon the external potential parameter. For constant layer number, the 
intralayer structure transits from a square lattice to a hexagonal (triangular) lattice as 
the confining potential decreases. For hexagonal lattices, both hcp and fcc 
characteristics were found but hcp structures dominate. The relative thickness of the 
system was also examined. The results were compared with previous experimental 
and theoretical results and found to agree. 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 

Dusty plasmas play an important role in astrophysical environments. Although 

there is little or no evidence yet of strongly coupled dusty plasmas in nature, the 
formation and stability mechanisms for ordered colloidal crystals within a tenuous 
dusty plasma is of great interest in protoplanetary, protostellar and accretion disk 
formation as well as spiral galaxies and dark matter research. A plasma crystal under 
typical experimental environments is formed when dust particles are levitated in an rf 
discharge plasma sheath above the lower electrode (Chu and I, 1994; Hayashi and 
Tachibana, 1994; Thomas et al., 1994). The particles are negatively charged with this 
charge shielded by the ambient plasma; thus the interaction between particles is a 
repulsive Yukawa potential defined by

where q is the particle charge, r is the distance between any two particles and λD is the

The total external potential in the plasma sheath has been shown to be a parabolic 

potential well (Tomme et al., 2000), thus it can be modeled as (Totsuji, 1997)

Structural phase transitions have been investigated by Dubin (1993) for a 
vertically confined One Component Plasma (OCP) system and by H. Totsuji (1997) 
for plasma crystals employing a confined Yukawa system as a model. These structural 
phase transitions have been observed experimentally in OCP systems (Mitchell et al., 
1998) and colloidal suspensions (Van-Winkle and Murry, 1986). A phase diagram has 
been established for the confined Yukawa system characterized by two dimensionless 
parameters, κ and η (Totsuji, 1997). The shielding parameter κ is defined by 

where a is the mean distance between particles defined by

In this research, a numerical code called Box_Tree (Richardson, 1993; Vasut and 
Hyde, 2001; Matthews and Hyde, 2003; Qiao and Hyde, 2003) is used to simulate the 
crystallization of a vertically confined complex plasma modeled as a Yukawa system. 
The plasma crystal structure is examined in detail and the structural phase transitions, 
including the transition between crystals with different numbers of layers and with the 
same number of layers but different intralayer structures, is investigated and 
compared with previous theoretical and experimental research results.

. 

Periodic boundary conditions in the XY direction are employed since the system 

considered has a size much smaller than that of a plasma crystal under a typical 
experimental environment. On the Z direction, a closed boundary condition is used 
with particles impacting the top or bottom boundaries of the box reflected under an 
elastic collision. 

All simulations start with a random distribution of particles placed in the box 
subject to the condition that the system’s center of mass must be located at the center 
of the box. The initial velocities of the particles are all set to zero. An ordered lattice 
(plasma crystal) forms approximately 65s after the start of the simulation. 

 

3. RESULTS 

 
Simulations were conducted for 46 η values between 0.0034 and 0.48. Over this 

range, the system transits from a single-layer crystal to a two, three, four and 
five-layer crystal as shown in Fig.1. These transitions start with the system forming a 

single-layer crystal for the range 

0.48

≥≥η

0.456

. As η decreases, the system 

evolves through a 1-2 layer transition at approximately 0.336. The system remains in 

a two-layer state for

336.0

≥≥η

072.0

, a three-layer state for

four-layer state for

and a five-layer state 

for

.0

0072

≥≥η

.0

0034

. This is to be expected since as can be seen in Eq. (4), a 

decrease in η causes a decrease in the confining potential. 

As shown in Figures 2 and 3, inside each stage as identified above, although the 

number of layers remains constant, the intralayer structure changes from that of a 
square lattice to that of a hexagonal (triangular) lattice as η decreases (or as the 
confining potential decreases). It can also be seen in Figs. 2 and 3 (b) and (e) that 
between each of these structure types, a transition stage exists where the lattice 
exhibits a complex structure showing a mixture of both square and hexagonal 
symmetry. This agrees with both theoretical predictions (Dubin, 1993; Totsuji, 1997) 
and experimental results (Mitchell et al., 1998; Van-Winkle and Murry, 1986). 
Figures 4 and 5 show the relationship between actual particle positions in 
different layers for crystals with differing number of layers. For both square and 
hexagonal structures, the layers stack in a staggered fashion, with the upper particles 
immediately above the center of the corresponding lattice cell below. As shown in 
Figures 4 and 5, b and d, particles on the third layer are primarily aligned vertically 
with particles in the first layer for hexagonal lattices, which is a characteristic of a hcp 
lattice. For a hcp lattice, particle positions within a hexagonal lattice plane repeat 
themselves every other plane; thus the planes are ordered as ABABAB …. On the 
other hand, for a fcc lattice, particle positions repeat every three planes; thus the 
planes are ordered as ABCABC …. As seen in Figures 4 and 5, the majority of lattices 
in this simulation are hcp even though only a portion of the lattice for the four-layer 
crystal shows a fcc characteristic. This is in agreement with both the OCP (Mitchell et 

al., 1998) and the colloidal suspension (Van-Winkle and Murry, 1986) experiments. 
The vertical alignment of particles in consecutive layers observed in plasma crystal 
experiments on earth (Thomas et al., 1994) was not seen in these simulation results. 
However, this is to be expected since such vertical alignment is caused by the wake 
effect of the ion flow and the system considered in this research is a pure Yukawa 
system. 

The relative thickness of the system, calculated as the absolute distance between 

the top and bottom layer and then normalized by the mean distance a, was also 
investigated as a function of η and is shown in Fig.6. It can clearly be seen that the 
relative thickness of the system increases as η decreases and that there are 
discontinuities in the function corresponding to the stepwise transitions in the number 
of layers N. The dependence of the intralayer structures on η is also shown in Fig.6. 
Both the structural phase transitions and the d-η function agree with Totsuji’s 
predictions (Totsuji, 1997) quantitatively. 
 
4.    CONCLUSIONS 
 

In summary, the crystallization of a complex plasma modeled as a vertically 

confined Yukawa system was simulated using the Box_Tree code. The system was 
found to exist as layered crystals with a different number of layers for different 
confining potentials. When the number of layers remains constant, the intralayer 
structure transitions from that of a square lattice to that of a hexagonal (triangular) 
lattice as the confining potential becomes weaker. This is in agreement with previous 
theoretical and experimental results. For hexagonal lattices, both hcp and fcc 
symmetry was seen with hcp structure dominating. This agrees with both OCP and 
colloidal suspension experiments while the d-η function shown was found to agree 
with Totsuji’s predictions quantitatively.

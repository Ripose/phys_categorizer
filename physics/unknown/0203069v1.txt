Abstract :  Semiclassical  methods  are  used  to  study  the  nonlinear  interaction  of

light in vacuum in the context of four wave mixing. This study is motivated by a

desire  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  using  recently  developed  powerful

ultrashort  (femtosecond)  laser  pulses  to  demonstrate  the  existence  of  nonlinear

effects  in  vacuum,  predicted  by  quantum  electrodynamics  (QED).  An  approach,

similar  to  classical  nonlinear  optics  in  a  medium,  is  developed  in  this  article.  A

third order nonlinear effective susceptibility of vacuum is then introduced .

1.   Introduction

It  has  been  known  for  some  time  now  that  quantum  electrodynamics  (QED)  predicts  the

existence of a nonlinear interaction between electromagnetic fields in vacuum [1-7].

The effects caused by the vacuum polarization are various.  Electric or magnetic anisotropy of

vacuum, are the subject of interesting theoretical and experimental research. For example the

PVLAS [8,9] is a experiment designed to measure the vacuum magnetic birefringence.  It is

based  on  a  very  sensitive  ellipsometer  and  on  the  use  of  a  strong  magnetic  field  and  weak

laser beams. 

In  our  laboratory,  progress  in  powerful  ultrashort  (femtosecond)  laser  pulses  [10]  is  an

opportunity for studying QED phenomena in intense laser beams electromagnetic fields. The

four wave nonlinear optical mixing process (FWM) in vacuum seems to be also a interesting

way to study vacuum nonlinearities [11-14]. In the present work, we analyze the achievability

of FWM in vacuum, and then we compare these theoretical results with FWM in a medium. A

third order nonlinear effective susceptibility of vacuum,

 , is then introduced to satisfy

)3(

the same differential equation as the one obtained in a gas characterized by an effective 

)3(
gasχ .

The  introduction  of 

  is  a  new  and  easy  way  to  compute  the  number  of  generated

)3(
vacuumχ

photons  in  vacuum.  In  the  last  part  of  this  article,  a  numerical  estimation  of  the  theoretical

power required to stimulate one photon by FWM with an ultrashort laser pulse is performed.

The power of existing laser pulses [10] is only a few orders of magnitude from this theoretical

estimation.  Nevertheless,  an  experimental  program  is  underway  at  Ecole  Polytechnique  to

search for possible non-QED new physics in photon-photon elastic scattering at low photon

energies (electron volts). A two beam experiment was performed in 1995, where an IR and a

green  laser  beam  were  brought  to  a  head-on  collision  in  vacuum,  and  possible  scattered

photons  were  searched  at  angle  [15].  A  FWM  experiment  was  also  performed  recently  in

1997 [16] with three focused beams crossing each other in a three-dimensional geometry.  A

new two-dimensional FWM experiment is proposed with two beams at the same wavelength (

λ1=λ2 =800  nm)  and  a  third  beam  generated  by  a  parametric  oscillator  at  λ3 =1300  nm.

Stimulated photons at λ4=577 nm were expected in gas or perhaps in vacuum.

3-2   Influence of field derivative terms in Lagrangian

A  modified  version  of  the  Heisenberg-Euler  theory  in  which  the  Lagrangian  incorporates

terms with field derivates, can be used to take into account vacuum dispersion. In our FWM

experiment we show that the influence of these terms is negligible. 

In the lowest approximation in dispersion and nonlinearity we have [12-14] :

electric  dipole  coupling.  We  study  FWM  in  a  low  pressure  gas  where  the  phase  matching

3-6-2   Optical phase conjugation

This case is obtained for a degenerate four-wave mixing  ω1 = ω2 = ω3  = ω4 = ω0 . The energy-

momentum conservation condition (3), is verified in this case only for a configuration with at

least two head-on laser beams as shown in figure 2 .

The  fourth  beam  is  then  generated  at  the  opposite  direction  of  the  third  laser  beam  at

The K constant depends on laser polarization and angle α3. We study two cases. The first one

3-6-3   Non  degenerate four-wave mixing

Optical phase conjugation uses four beams at the same wavelength. This experimental set-up

is nearly impossible to realize because of the difficulties of detecting some generated photons

in an intense noise background at the same wavelength. A two-dimensional set-up is proposed

to  detect  generated  photons  with  a  different  wavelength  and  different  angle.    We  study  the

interesting case of  two beams with the same wavelength λ1=λ2 and a third beam at λ3.

We now calculate the number of photons generated by FWM in a gas or vacuum, by solving

equation (7) for different laser profiles and for the plane wave approximation.

3-7-4   Non collinear Gaussian focused beams

The laser beams propagate in different directions with different wavelengths. Therefore, the

collinear  approximation  is  not  valid.  A  numerical  program  is  made  to  obtain  an  equivalent

interaction length,  Leq , by using Gaussian beams with the following expression :

 where xj, yj, zj are functions of

computed with non collinear beams. In the non collinear approximation, Leq is often close to

w0. 

3-7-5   Numerical applications

In  the  case  of  λ1=λ2=800nm,  λ3=1300nm,  λ4=  577nm  an  experimental  2D  configuration  is

obtained, as in figure (3), for α2=110°. Then we compute  α3= -44° , α4= 81° and  K=6.5.

For  ultrashort  laser  pulses  (τ=30fs)  and  in  the  diffraction  limit  with  focal  spots

w01=w02=w03=5µm, we compute Leq=4.4µm. We then need ε1 ε2 ε3=5.105 J3 or ε1 =ε2 =ε3=80

J  to  obtain  one  photon  per  laser  shot.  Using  a  10Hz  repetition  rate  laser  and  with  beam

energies of ε1=ε2=12J, ε3=100 mJ, we obtain one photon per hour. 

3-7-6  FWM experiment

A three beam experiment with ultrashort laser pulses (τ=40fs) was performed recently [16].

Two  laser  beams  at  805nm  produced  by  a  Ti :Saphire  laser,  and  a  third  beam  at  1300nm

generated  by  a  parametric  oscillator,  were  brought  to  collision  in  vacuum.  The  three  beams

were focused by a single optic made of a pair of spherical mirrors (Bowen) in a 3-dimensional

configuration.  Stimulated  photons  at  λ4 ≈ 561nm  were  observed  in  a  gas  jet  but  not  in

vacuum.  The  parameters  of  the  experiment  were :  w01=w02=4µm,  w03=6µm,  ε1=15mJ,

ε2=5.5mJ ε3=20µJ.  The  numerical  calculation  gives  K ≈ 0.56  and  Leq ≈ 5  µm.  Taking  into

account  loss  factors  (photomultiplier  efficiency,  spectrometer  transmission  ...),  we  obtain
finally  a  theoretical  prediction  of  (N4)vacuum ≈ 6.2  10-20  photons  per  shot  while  the  observed

12

limit is 6 10-3  photons per shot. The experimental result is 17 order of magnitude under QED

prediction. Several orders of magnitude could be gained by an improvement in the tuning of

the laser, the OPA, and by further work on the background noise. 

4.  Conclusion

We have compared the calculation of four wave mixing in vacuum and in a gas. The identical

form of the equation giving the growth rate of the fourth beam allowed us to define a third

order  nonlinear  susceptibility  in  vacuum, 

.  This  susceptibility  is  computed  for  a

)3(
vacuumχ

geometric  laser  configuration  in  two  or  three  dimensions.  Some  experimental  arrangements

are proposed to eventually observe four wave mixing in vacuum with powerful laser beams.

Numerical estimations are made with ultrashort laser pulses. For instance, the purpose of the

experimental  program  underway  at  Ecole  Polytechnique,  is  to  search  for  possible  non-QED

new  physics  at  low  photon  energies,  but,  with  the  evolution  of  laser  technology,  the  QED

effect predicted in low energy will probably be observed in a few years.

  Abstract. We present a novel explanation of the physical 

processes behind tornadogenesis.  We suggest that charge 

separation found in supercell thunderstorms serves to condense 

the existing angular momentum through the additional process of 

the electric force.  Based on this, we present a plausible 

geometry that explains why many tornadoes begin at storm mid-

levels and build downward.  We show that this geometry can 

explain the observations that ground level tornadoes thrive in 

regions with high shear and large convective available potential 

energy (CAPE).  A simple model based on this geometry leads to 

rational time scales spanning from the birth of a supercell to the 

touchdown of a tornado.  We make some predictions of specific 

measurable quantities.

1.  Motivation 

Many of the physical conditions required to initiate tornadoes are well understood on 

a broad qualitative level but many quantitative details remain unknown.  On the 

qualitative level, it is apparent that the deep rotation of a supercell thunderstorm along 

with a buoyant updraft and a rain-driven downdraft create a probable environment for 

tornadogenesis.  Yet, we still do not quantitatively understand the full range of energy 

inputs which allow particular storms to spawn tornadoes while other storms with 

similar macroscopic properties do not.  Furthermore, we cannot currently predict the 

length (minutes to hours) or intensity of the tornadoes that do form [Davies-Jones,

2001].  This suggests the presence of one or more physical thresholds in the system 

that, once crossed, spawn a tornado.  Systems in which the relevant threshold is not 

achieved, therefore fail to form a tornado.  As an example, evidence indicates that a 

certain amount of boundary layer shear in conjunction with a certain level of 

convective available potential energy (CAPE) is required for a tornado to occur 

[Rasmussen, 1998].

 One clear attribute is that most tornadoes spawn from supercells and associated 

convective activity.   In particular, Trapp et al. [2005] showed that 79% of all 

tornadoes for the years 1998-2000 came from supercells.  We also know that around 

two-thirds of this 79% of supercell-spawned tornadoes begin their rotation aloft (2-7 

km) and then descend to form ground level tornadoes in what is known as a 

Patton 4

descending “tornado vortex signature” (TVS) [Trapp, 1999].  This means that 

roughly half of all tornadoes begin in a supercell cloud and then descend to make 

ground level tornadoes.  This further suggests the existence of a triggering 

mechanism which we explore in this paper. 

While current theories adequately take into account the large-scale rotation and 

potential buoyancy associated with a supercell (see Davies-Jones et al. [2001] for a 

review) they do not yet include any effects from the potentially massive amounts of 

energy stored in charge separation.   In this paper we link the condensation of angular 

momentum beginning in the heart of the supercell with an electrical force that 

naturally exists in all supercells due to charge separation.  We qualitatively show how 

this embryonic tornado structure, enhanced by its electrical properties, can lead to a 

central downdraft that will build the condensation of rotation downward.  We then 

use a simple numerical model to demonstrate that the time scales associated with the 

development of the tornado are similar to empirical observation (e.g. minutes).  We 

finish by showing how latent heat release and preexisting boundary layer shear in 

conjunction with the central downdraft can lead to the formation of a stable ground 

level tornado.

2.  History 

Patton 5

As the large-scale lightning/thunder associated with supercells is clearly due to 

massive amounts of charge separation, the basic idea of charge exchange and 

movement having some bearing on tornadic activity has precedent.  Lucretius [circa 

60 BC] and Francis Bacon [1622], observing that lightning sometimes precedes a 

tornado, wrote about the idea.  Later, Peltier [1840] and Hare [1837] independently 

put forth theories that tornadoes are conduits for charge exchange in the atmosphere.  

The quantitative ability to accurately measure the electrical properties of 

thunderstorms let alone tornadoes (e.g. charge densities, charge separation length 

scales, etc) did not exist when these theories were presented.  This fact caused the 

subsequent neglect of these theories.

Bernard Vonnegut [1960] revived the idea by hypothesizing that electrical heating 

(through ohmic dissipation) might be able to sustain the intense winds observed in a 

tornado.  He conjectured that electrical heating from a continuous electrical current 

could create temperature gradients strong enough so that air would be accelerated to 

tornadic speeds.  Cobine [1978], along with Watkins and Vonnegut, later undertook a 

laboratory experiment which showed that a vortex discharge alone could not account 

for total tornado wind intensity; there was simply not enough current energy density 

in a thunderstorm to maintain the required constant arc. 

  We agree that Vonnegut’s theory is untenable due to the massive amount of 

continuous current required to make it work.  Qualitatively, however, there is 

certainly energy associated with the electrical field in tornadoes and the conversion of

that energy into other forms may be one of the triggers or threshold mechanisms that 

spawn the tornado.  The simple fact that 79% of all tornadoes come from supercell 

thunderstorms, the largest and most intense class of thunderstorms, suggests a 

100

connection.  Furthermore, there are significant observations that link electrical 

101

activity to tornadoes.

3.  Electrical Connection

103

104

105

Numerous eyewitness accounts within the last one hundred years report various 

106

noteworthy electrical phenomena associated with tornadoes including St. Elmo’s fire, 

107

glowing funnel, glowing patches of cloud, etc.  Church and Barnhart [1979] compiled 

108

the eyewitness reports from 67 separate tornadoes between 1787 and 1975 into one 

109

paper.  Despite their quantity, eyewitness reports are not quantitative and therefore do 

110

not provide conclusive proof of an electrical phenomenon.  These eyewitnesses are 

111

not trained scientists, and this provides further grounds to question their testimony.  

112

The sheer number of independent reports does, however, point to some sort of 

113

association between tornadoes and luminous electrical phenomena which is worthy of 

114

further investigation.

115

Visual evidence and supporting eyewitness accounts of luminous electrical 

116

phenomena were presented by Vonnegut and Weyer [1966].  Their evidence was a 

117

nighttime picture that showed what appeared to be two glowing funnels at the 

118

approximate position where a tornado passed.  Eyewitnesses also reported that the 

119

funnels were glowing and told of other electrical activity near the funnels.  Further 

120

evidence of electrical activity associated with tornadoes has been collected in 

121

numerous studies in the form of electromagnetic (EM) noise called sferics (see 

122

MacGorman and Rust [1998]).  These high frequency emanations are traditionally 

123

related to lightning and come in pulses coincident with lightning discharges.  Both 

124

before and during a tornado remarkably intense sferics have been observed.  During 

125

the lifecycle of the tornado the sferic pulse repetition rate becomes so high as to be 

Patton 8

126

almost constantly emitted.  Sferic data suggests that in about 80% or more of tornadic 

127

storms there is an increase in total sferic rates near the time of the tornado 

128

[MacGorman, 1989].  Furthermore, sferics with frequencies above 1 MHz were found 

129

to increase in intensity and become most extreme in the time leading up to and during 

130

a ground level tornado [MacGorman, 1989].   At the very least, this suggests some 

131

form of increase in total electrical activity within the system prior to and during a 

132

ground level tornado.  Observed radiation during tornadoes seems to indicate that a 

133

semi-continuous mode of lightning is occurring.  MacGorman et al. [1989] suggested 

134

that the increase in the measured sferic intensities is dominated by inter-cloud 

135

lightning; this is similar to what has been observed recently in what are called lighting 

136

holes.

137

Lightning holes are essentially lightning free regions within supercells that have 

138

been observed in association with strong updrafts (bounded weak echo regions) 

139

[Lang, 2004].  They are identifiable because they occur in the deepest part of the 

140

thunderstorm surrounded by vigorous lightning.  In at least one case a lightning hole 

141

has been found to be spatially coincident with a tornado; the lightning hole appeared 

142

before tornado touchdown and became the most pronounced during the tornado 

143

[Zhang, 2004].  Furthermore, the authors found that “The lightning channels of 

144

inter-cloud lightning discharge exhibit clockwise rotary structures and do not have 

145

clear bi-level structures in the vicinity of the tornado”.  This phenomenon may 

146

support a charge relaxation mechanism but is not yet well understood.

147

Overall, there seems to be appreciable evidence to indicate that there is a 

148

heightened level of electrical activity associated with and in the vicinity of tornadoes.

Patton 9

149

From the sferic data and the lightning hole measurements there seems to be electrical 

150

activity preceding and concurrent with a ground level tornado.  Other authors 

151

[Vonnegut, 1960; Winn, 2000] have compiled other electrical facts not mentioned in 

152

this paper.  Motivated by evidence for a more direct electrical connection, we will 

153

now propose a mechanism through which charged airflow leads to the organization of 

154

a TVS.

155

156

4.  The Tornado Vortex Signature 

Patton 10

A TVS is a low resolution Doppler radar image of an embryonic or fully 

159

developed tornado.  This structure, which is evidence of strong axial rotation, 

160

generally develops before a tornado touches down, intensifies while the tornado goes 

161

through its mature stage, and dissipates as the tornado dies [Brown, 1978].  Trapp et 

162

al. [1999] found that roughly half of all TVSs form aloft (median height of 4-5 km) 

163

and then build downward (mode I) while the other half either start near the ground 

164

and build upward quickly or form simultaneously over several kilometers of depth 

165

(mode II).   Both modes are precursors to ground level tornado formation but do not 

166

necessarily lead to tornadoes [Trapp, 1999].  Likewise, a measurable TVS does not 

167

precede all tornadoes.  Davies-Jones [1986] suggested that this might be due to 

168

limitations in radar resolution and/or the stringency of the automated detection 

169

algorithms.  For simplicity, we will concentrate on mode I formation, but will touch 

170

on mode II a little as well.  The charge structure of the parent cloud gives important 

171

clues to the nature of these extra physics influences.

5.  The Supercell Mesocyclone Charge Structure 

Patton 11

173

174

175

Initially, local weather conditions spawn a convective supercell.  The defining 

176

characteristics of the supercell are large charge separations and a persistent large-

177

scale rotation known as the mesocyclone.  The spatial scale of this rotation is between 

178

3 and 9 kilometers in diameter [Davies-Jones, 2001] and generally extends to the 

179

vertical limit of the storm [MacGorman and Rust 1998 p. 236].   

180

Supercells are “charge stratified,” meaning that alternating regions of positive and 

181

negative charge layers are stacked on top of each other.  Stolzenburg et al. [1998b] 

182

reported that supercell storms generally have 4 alternating charge layers in the strong 

183

updraft region and up to 8 outside the main updraft region.  In the strong updraft 

184

region the lowest two layers consist of a deep (1-4 km), low-density positive charge 

185

region between about 4 and 8 km above mean sea level (msl) with a shallow, dense 

186

negative charge layer residing between 8 and 10 km above msl.  Marshal et al. [1995] 

187

were the first to report this phenomena and to note a very fast electric-field change at 

188

the boundary between the lowest two regions.  This electric-field anomaly, also 

189

observed in charged particle measurements by Stolzenburg et al. [1998a], is evidence 

190

of a highly charged bi-layer that resides at the interface between the lower positive 

191

region and the main negative charge region above.  Termed “benchmark charge 

192

regions”, these layers were found to contain charge densities on the order of ~10 nC 

193

m-3 [Marshall, 1995].   However, there are not many reliable measures of charge 

194

density at this level, so the true variation around this order of magnitude of observed 

Patton 12

195

values is unknown.   For instance, at certain times, the charge densities could be 

196

significantly higher.

197

Another aspect of these “benchmark charge regions” that will become important 

198

later is their temperature profile.  At this level in the cloud the temperature crosses the 

199

freezing point of water with cold air higher than the warm air.  The temperature turns 

200

over at the point of interaction between the two charge layers.  The mixing of liquid, 

201

ice, and graupel may be responsible for the thunderstorm’s largest charge separation 

202

through the non-inductive collisional process (see MacGorman [1998] for an 

203

overview).  The change in overall particle composition and size within an evolving 

204

thunderstorm is quite complex but also strongly suggests that there should be 

205

significant evolution in charge densities as the charge carriers themselves are 

206

evolving, changing size and even changing phase. 

207

Consider the idealized situation: two large charge regions with a highly charged 

208

bi-layer at the interface within a rotating system (Figure 1a).  The rotation will tend to 

209

centrifuge everything outward causing a lower-pressure region to form near the axis.  

210

Let us imagine that our charged bi-layer dips downward (Figure 1b).  This could 

211

happen due to a downdraft, a drainage effect due to the density stratified rotating 

212

system, or because this leads to a lower energy configuration of the electromagnetic 

213

system.  As the bi-layer deforms, the central negatively charged air sinking down 

214

finds itself surrounded by positively charged rotating air.  The electric force now 

215

begins to draw the positively charged air inward while allowing the uncharged air to 

216

filter outward.  The decrease in radius leads to faster rotation through conservation of 

217

angular momentum as well as a lower pressure on axis and draws the dipping 

Patton 13

218

negative region downward further (Figure 1c).  The negative charges of the core will 

219

also be drawn outward aiding the creation of a low-pressure core. 

220

Another important process occurring to maintain the coherence of the nascent 

221

TVS is latent heating.  The lower positive region is slightly warmer than freezing 

222

while the upper negative region is made up of ice particles.  When the cold air moves 

223

down the center and then mixes with the incoming wet air then the water will freeze 

224

releasing its latent heat to the surrounding parcel of air.  This heating will buoy the 

225

parcel upward and out of the system.  The core downdraft will be re-supplied from 

226

above and the lower air has enough rotating air that can move inward to sustain the 

227

exchange.  This is a very similar situation to what happens at ground level as will be 

228

discussed later. 

229

In the positive outer sheath, particles are kept in orbit around the core by the 

230

effects of the pressure gradient force, the electric force, and latent heating.  Mixing of 

231

the sheath and the core will occur at the boundary causing charge neutralization, 

232

heating, and then removal of the mixed air from the system by being buoying upward 

233

and centrifuged outward.  This does not stop the charge flow.  In fact, the exit of this 

234

air from the system will help drive the flow because the neutralized air will be 

235

centrifuged outward and upward allowing more negatively charged cold air from the 

236

upper layer to descend.

237

As the negative central downdraft delves deeper into the positive region the 

238

attraction of opposite charges as well as latent heating condenses the angular 

239

momentum at each successive level, lowering the axial pressure, drawing down more 

240

negatively charged air from above, which again condenses the angular momentum of 

Patton 14

241

the rotating wet positive region at the next lowest level.  This runaway reaction will 

242

intensify rotation and build the TVS downward.  It represents a plausible threshold 

243

scenario in which the amount of charge separation and water content determines the 

244

rate at which the TVS can grow.  As stated earlier, few electrical measurements exist 

245

in this region of the storm, but it seems reasonable that charge separation densities in 

246

these systems may have a large range of values.  Systems with insufficient charge 

247

density to induce a strong enough electrical force will fail to develop beyond their 

248

embryonic stage.  It is therefore beneficial to attempt to understand what this 

249

threshold is in a quantitative manner. 

250

250

6. Model and Calculations 

Patton 15

As an ideal model, we assume a core cylinder of negative charge at the center 

253

around which a sheath of positive charge rotates at a constant rate.  To simplify the 

254

model further, we consider a single charged particle rotating around the core at some

255

initial radius.  If there were no charges on either body then the rotating particle will 

256

remain in orbit around the core at the same radius due to the pressure gradient force; 

257

we neglect any turbulent effects for now.  With the addition of charges there will be 

258

an imbalance of forces and the charged particle will be drawn inward (for the sake of

259

this estimate we assume that the core is static).  The balance of forces then reduces to 

260

a one-dimensional equation with axial forces:

(cid:190)(cid:3)v=radial velocity of the particle.   

(cid:190)(cid:3)a=the observed acceleration of the particle 

We solve for acceleration and then are able to numerically integrate twice to find 

278

position as a function of time.  With a time-dependent position, we can estimate the time 

279

it takes for the particle to reach the outer radius of the core.  We do this by starting the 

280

particle from rest, calculating the instantaneous acceleration, allowing the particle to 

281

accelerate at that rate for a set time step, and then recalculating the acceleration and 

282

velocity.  Repeatedly stepping through this routine, we track position (relative to the axis 

283

of the system), radial velocity, time, and acceleration.  For our model the time step was 

284

set to one second; making it smaller did not change the resulting condensation time 

285

appreciably.  Other variables listed above were given realistic values, based on available 

286

observations, and will be explained presently.

The highest measured benchmark charge regions from Marshall et al. [1995] were 

13.4 nC m-3 and the inferred charge densities from measurements of a multicell severe 

thunderstorm by Byrne et al. [1987] in MacGorman and Rust (1998 p.239) are -17 nC m-

3.  Therefore, a core charge density of (cid:545)-(cid:167)-10 nC m-3 is a reasonable estimate of what 

291

really occurs in a supercell.

292

The estimate of charge on our single particle is a little more difficult to make.  No 

293

data exist (to our knowledge) on either the size or charge of particles (water droplet, 

294

hailstone, graupel, etc) within supercells near the Rear Flank Downdraft.  It has been 

295

shown however, that different types of thunderstorms (New Mexican thunderstorms, 

Patton 17

296

Mesoscale Convective Systems, and Supercells) have the same basic charge structures 

297

[Stolzenburg, 1998c].  The same researchers found that highly charged layers in the weak 

298

updraft region of New Mexican thunderstorms are very similar in charge density to the 

299

benchmark regions found by Marshall et al [1995].  The temperature profile in both 

300

storms at that layer is the same: the temperature crosses zero near the middle of the bi-

301

layer.  Also, both studies indicated that the lower layer’s charge is carried on precipitation 

302

particles.  For these reasons we believe that the particle size and charge found on 

303

individual particles in the New Mexican thunderstorm should be similar to those found in 

304

analogous layers in a typical supercell; the difference in a supercell would be that the 

305

spatial extent is larger and the system is rotating.  Stolzenburg et al. [1998a] reported a 

306

mean single positive particle charge in the layer between 6-6.6 km height (analogous to 

307

Marshall et al.’s benchmark region) as being -29.3 pC.  We therefore use an estimate of -

308

30 pC for the charge on our orbiting particle.  Stolzenburg et al. [1998a] also report an 

309

average droplet diameter of 2.1 mm.  Using this diameter and the density of water, we 

310

can estimate the mass of these particles (assuming a spherical shape) and use this radius 

311

to find the cross-sectional area. 

312

Positively charged particles will start at some radius from the axis of the supercell 

313

rotation and “fall” inward to the final (core) radius.  Initially we will set the beginning 

314

radius to be 3000 meters (consistent with observations of large scale rotation) and we will 

315

set the final radius to be 500 meters.  These values are on the scale of mesocyclone 

316

rotations (diameter ~6 km) and echo free central vaults (diameter ~1 km).  

317

If we use these estimates of the physical parameters in combination with the force 

318

balance equation derived above, we can derive a relation between core charge density and 

Patton 18

319

particle transit time (e.g. from 3 km to ½ km).  Figure 2 shows that the time needed for 

320

condensation of a charged particle, in minutes, is consistent with time scales TVSs form 

321

on.  Also we assume (cid:545)

air=1 kg m-3 and CD=1 (due to estimates of the Reynolds number 

322

associated with our moving particle). 

323

If we arbitrarily state that any angular condensation that takes more than ~15 minutes 

324

will fail to develop due to turbulent dissipation then we can say that any core charge 

325

densities higher than ~5 nC m-3 indicate a high probability of TVS formation and high 

326

tornado danger.  This statement must be tempered by the fact that supercells with a highly 

327

coherent large scale rotation will be able to form TVSs on longer time scales, while more 

328

turbulent cells will not remain stable long enough for the concentration of angular 

329

momentum to fully mature.  This indicates that there should be some parameter space in 

330

which charge density and cloud rotation can predict the probability of TVS formation.  

331

This is well beyond the scope of this calculation and model and is left for future 

332

investigation.  Overall, however, our model and calculation has returned a condensation 

333

timescale that is consistent with storm timescales.  This fortifies our main scientific point:  

334

once the charge density reaches a critical value, there is a significant probability that 

335

tornadogenesis will occur.

7.  Ground-Level Tornadoes and Latent Heating 

338

339

351

352

353

354

Once the nascent tornado has formed in the cloud as a TVS, the runaway process 

340

explained above will build the vortex downward until either the reaction runs out of 

341

energy (either rotational energy or charge separation energy) and decays, or the 

342

vortex reaches close enough to the ground to tap into the massive convective 

343

available potential energy (CAPE).  When the vortex descends this far, the cold 

344

downdraft core will mix with moist air causing immediate buoyancy of the mixed 

345

parcel. It has been found that enhanced levels of CAPE, as well as boundary layer 

346

shear, are present at the time of tornado formation [Rasmussen, 1998].  The CAPE 

347

number represents the energy density of moist air if all the water were condensed and 

348

the energy released via latent heating.  Boundary layer shear is a measure of the 

349

change in velocities from one radar bin to the next in the lowest 6 km of a supercell; 

350

higher values indicate faster rotation.  Typical values of CAPE at the ground near 

tornadoes average 1300 J kg-3 but can be up to around 3000 J kg-3.  The values of 

boundary layer shear have been found to be around 18 m s-1 on average with a 

maximum of 29 m s-1 [Rasmussen, 1998].

Introduction of a descending TVS with a cold central core (on the order of -10ºC) 

355

into an area with large CAPE and sufficient boundary layer shear will form a ground 

356

level tornado.  If the cold air core of a TVS reaches low enough to come into contact 

357

with air containing a lot of moisture then this may be a “sudden” source of energy 

358

which can act as a trigger.  The subsequent latent heating could occur relatively 

359

immediately leading to a violent upwelling from the ground rather than from higher 

Patton 20

360

in the cloud.  This process leads to a stable flow because the preexisting rotation of 

361

the ground level air ensures that the converging air will go into orbit around the core, 

362

mix with core air lowering the temperature to 0 degrees C (or below), gain heat due to 

363

the release of CAPE, and then move upward quickly.  This behavior allows the 

364

central downdraft to remain intact while keeping the pressure at the axis of rotation 

365

low enough to facilitate the continual descent of the low-pressure core.  The air of the 

366

cold downdraft is continually lost to mixing with the ground level air, but it will also 

367

be replaced continually from the reservoir above.  This geometry is stable as long as 

368

both air reservoirs are not depleted.

369

This configuration can also explain the long life of single tornadoes or multiple 

370

track tornadoes.  If the ground level air runs out of enough CAPE to continue the 

371

reaction, or the tornado entrains too much mass to rotate fast enough to maintain the 

372

low pressure core, the ground level tornado can break up and ascend into the clouds 

373

only to return minutes (or tens of minutes) later when more CAPE is available or the 

374

rotation has simply rid itself of the debris it was carrying; the cloud level TVS never 

375

stops its rotation.  Assuming that charge exchange continues to fuel the TVS in the 

376

cloud, the ground level tornado can persist as long as the storm continually moves 

377

through areas with high ground level CAPE.

378

Another possible scenario occurs when enough ground level boundary layer sheer 

379

and enough CAPE exists that the rotation may be able to create a low enough 

380

pressure core to draw down cold air from above.  This may spawn a ground level 

381

tornado through the same latent heat release as above but without the aid of any 

382

electric force.  This mode of formation should be more short-lived, as it will not have 

383

the organizing effect of the electric force from the cloud above.  This may be a good 

384

explanation as to what happens in mode II tornadogenesis.  Indeed, viable numerical 

385

models have demonstrated tornado-like behavior without the presence of any electric 

Patton 21

386

forces [Lewellen, 1997].

8. Discussion 

389

390

Assuming that there is sufficient rotational energy in the pre-tornadic mesocyclone to 

391

accelerate air to TVS speeds, we have presented a novel theory that suggests an electrical 

392

mechanism plays a crucial role in allowing the cloud level condensation of angular 

393

momentum.  Cloud level TVSs would occur when enough rotational coherence is 

394

coupled with the required charge separation.  Through consideration of the organizing 

395

role of charge density, we have outlined a plausible runaway effect for accelerating and 

396

sustaining a rotating column of air building from mid-cloud towards the ground.  

397

Furthermore, we have shown in a simplified model that observed charge densities lead to 

398

inward forces that result in reasonable condensation time scales.  We have further 

399

presented a plausible explanation for ground level tornadic stability.  The geometry 

400

shows that latent heating can result in a hydrodynamic sink sustaining the concentration 

401

of angular momentum at ground level as well as keeping the axial pressure low enough to 

402

continually draw down cold air from above.  

403

This ground level tornadic flow known as a “two-celled” structure (a central 

404

downdraft with an upward moving outer sheath) has been suspected for many years 

405

[Davies-Jones, 1986; Whipple, 1982], and stable solutions to the Navier-Stokes 

406

equation with this geometry have been presented [Kuo, 1966; Sullivan, 1959].

407

Furthermore, an echo free region (i.e. free of liquid hydrometeors) at the core of 

408

larger tornadoes is known to exist and has been directly observed through the use of 

409

the Doppler On Wheels (DOW) [Bluestein, 2003; Wurman, 2002].  Our theory goes 

410

one-step further by plausibly explaining the development of the central downdraft and 

Patton 23

411

TVS.

412

413

414

415

416

417

The suggested geometry has three specific testable attributes:  

(cid:190)(cid:3)Significant central negative charge density; 

(cid:190)(cid:3)A horizontal temperature profile above the ground with strong transition 

regions between warm and cold air; 

(cid:190)(cid:3) A low-pressure core; 

The first attribute may only be testable 2-8 kilometers above the ground since as the 

418

core descends its charges will migrate outward toward the sheath and neutralize.  

419

Lightning holes may be evidence of this configuration but are not yet understood well 

420

enough to be used as conclusive proof.  The second and third attributes are more easily 

421

probed near ground level. The horizontal temperature cross section of a tornado above the 

422

ground will look something like Figure 3 (the levels are not meant to be exact, but 

423

represent the general trends that will be observed). 

424

Heated mixing regions where CAPE is being released are represented by the two 

425

upward bumps and should be warmer than both the core and the ambient.  The cool core 

426

is at the center and should be colder than the freezing point of water.  Outside of the 

427

heated bumps the temperature approaches ambient conditions.  The resolution of this 

428

cross section is worse closer to the ground because of boundary layer turbulence.  The 

429

best measurement will come from a large tornado with good ground contact ensuring the 

430

presence of a substantial core near the ground that sustains itself for a few minutes. 

431

The third measurable parameter is pressure.  Our model has a core reaching the 

432

ground that is pulling air from high cloud levels where the temperature is below freezing.  

Patton 24

433

If this is the case, then the pressure in the core should be the same as that of where the air 

434

is originating.  This means that the core pressure near ground level should be less than 

435

half that of the ambient ground level pressure.  The pressure at the ground will be subject 

436

to boundary layer conditions and therefore must be a mix of ground level and high-level 

437

air.  The core pressure near ground level will depend on the diameter of the tornado at the 

438

ground and how well the core is screened from the ambient pressure by the rising walls of 

439

the tornado.  The pressure deficit will be most measurable in large long-lived tornadoes.

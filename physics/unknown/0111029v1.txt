Abstract

A set of power supplies (PS) with output power rated
from  100  W  up  to  10  KW  for  electromagnets  was
developed.  These  PS  have  range  of  current  tuning  of
60-80 db with high accuracy (error should be less than
0,01%).  Some  types  of  power  supplies  have  bipolar
output current. The report will describe a set of unified
embedded devices for control and measurements of PS
incorporated  into  distributed  control  systems.  These
embedded  devices 
includes  DAC,  ADC  with
multiplexers  and  status  input/output    registers.  The
devices  include  microprocessor  and  allow  work  with
minimal  host  involving.  This  capability  decreases
traffic,

1 INTRODUCTION
Budker  Institute  of  Nuclear  Physics  (BINP)  is
building  a  few 
installation  (VEPP-5,  FEL)  and
upgrading  a  existing  collider  (VEPP-2000,  VEPP-4
[1]).  Mentioned 
include  hundreds  of
(lenses,  correctors)  which  are
magnet  elements 
powered  by  controlled  power  supplies  designed  and
produced  by  BINP.  All  power  supplies  are  computer
controlled via digital-to-analog converters. Current and
voltage in elements are measured with analog-to-digital
converters.

installations 

There was developed a set of embedded devices for
control  of  power  supplies.  They  have  unified
implementation,  similar  connectors  and  software
protocol. Integration with control system is provided by
popular network- CANBUS.

elements 

supplies,
correspondingly,  may  be  divided  into  two  different
groups.  A  first  group  includes  bending  magnets  and
lenses.  A  second  one  includes  low  current  correctors.
Elements  of  first  group  require  high  stability  and
accuracy  of  power  supplies.  Typical  requirements  to
accuracy  of  this  power  supplies  are  from  0,01%  to
these
0,001%. 
requirements  are  lower.  It  ranges  approximately  near
0,1% typically.

  For  corrector’s  power  supplies 

A wide gap in required accuracy makes us to design
a  two  different  type  of  controllers.  The  first  is  precise

controller for bending magnet and lens power supplies.
The  second  is  inexpensive  multi-channel  device  for
multi-channel power supply systems for correctors.

A  precise  controller  should  provide  one  DAC
channel  with  resolution  approximately  0,001%  and
accuracy  at  least  0,01%.  It  should  provide  also  4-5
channels of ADC  with  similar  accuracy  and  resolution
of  measurement  of  the  output  current  and  voltage.  It
should also measure of some additional voltages inside
PS.  It  is  very  useful  to  check  logical  status  of  some
points  of  power  supplies  (protection  circuitry  status,
presence  of  water  flow  and  etc)  and  ON/OFF  control
for  different  purposes.  For  this  tasks  the  controller
should  provide  a  few  channels  of  input/output  register
with optocouplers.

Inexpensive  multi-channel  controller  should  provide
multiple-channel  DAC  (we  have  chosen  16  channels
per controller) with accuracy at least 0,1 % and multi-
channel  ADC  (we  have  chosen  40  channels  per
controller) with the same accuracy. For digital IN/OUT
it should include a few channels of input/output register
with optocouplers.

For  connection  of  the  controllers  with  control

computers we have chosen CANBUS. It provides:

- 
- 

high reliability;
determined  delivery 
packets;

time  for  high  priority

-  wide support by chip and board manufacturers;
- 

opportunity  of  galvanic 
controller and media;
growing  popularity  of  this  network  in  world
physical centers.

There  are  a  number  of  CAN  application  level
protocols.  A  structure  and  resources  of  chosen
microprocessor    don’t  prevent  to  implement  one  of
them  in  our  devices.  But  using  of  many  CAN-devices
requires  to  reduce  traffic  as  much  as  possible.  This
reason  lead  us  to  direct  use  of  the  CAN  message
objects. But this opportunity may be realized later.

3 STRUCTURE OF CONTROLLERS
A  multi-channel  controller  is  implemented  in  two
physically  independent  devices.  One  of  them  contains
multi-channel DAC, the second includes multi-channel
ADC. Other properties of these devices are identical.

Below  in  Fig.1  is  presented  a  block-diagram  of  all
mentioned devices. All of them includes a few identical
(microprocessor,  CAN  controller,  DC-DC
parts 

converter,    input/output  register)    and  specific  analog
parts, which are different for both devices.

An analog part of multi-channel DAC (CANDAC16)

and 16 sample-and-hold devices (see Fig.3).

Microprocessor  loads  code  into  DAC  chip,  then
connect output of DAC with chosen capacitor to update
charge.  After  some  time  microprocessor  repeats  this
sequence for next channel. This approach allows built a
multi-channel DAC with low cost per channel. We use
external  reference  source  to  improve  stability  and
accuracy  of  device.  There  is  no  here  of  the  galvanic
isolation  between  analog  and  digital  areas.  It  makes
design more cheap.

An analog part of multi-channel ADC (CANADC40)
is  based  on  sigma-delta  ADC  chip  (ADS1210,  Burr-
Brown)  (see fig.4).

Fig.2. Analog part of precise controller.

A  design  is  based  on  Burr-Brown  delta-sigma
converters.  A  design  of  ADC  is  quite  classical.  Input
signals  connected  with  ADS1210  through  multiplexer
with  incorporated  overvoltage  protection  (Burr-Brown
MPC507).  5  two-wired  channels  intended  for  external
signal  measurements.  One  channel  is  connected  with
DAC  output  inside  board.  This  feature  gives  us
opportunity  to  control  DAC  and  to  correct  it  by
microprocessor.  One  channel  of  multiplexer 
is
connected with “ground” and another –  with  reference
voltage. This feature allows using “system calibration”
of ADC chip and to reduce most sources of  inaccuracy.
Design  of  DAC  have  some  specific.  Chosen  chip
(DAC1220)  provides  output  signal  from  0  to  +5V.
Most our power supplies require range up to 10 V. So,
DAC1220  voltage  is  doubled  by  circuitry  with  “flying
capacity”, then it may be inverted by similar circuitry.

The analog  part  of  precise  controller  is  galvanically
isolated from digital part of device. It is provided with

This circuitry contains 40-channel multiplexer based
on  MPC507,  (multiplexer  with  incorporated  over-
voltage  protection),  programmable  gain  amplifier
(PGA), delta-sigma ADC (ADS1210, Burr-Brown) and
reference  source.  A  PGA  chip  is  used  to  allow
automatic  changing  of  the  input  range  of  meter.  Here
isn’t  galvanic  isolation  between  ADC  analog  and
digital areas.

5 EMBEDDED SOFTWARE
Embedded  software  for  all  devices  is  written  in
time  for  critical
assembler  to  ensure  determined 
sections  of  code.  All  devices  use  very  similar  or
identical messages.

in 

Controllers  with  DAC  on  board  have  additional
feature.  They  can  load  from  line  a  few  files,  which
describe  changing  output  voltage 
time.  Host
computer  can  request  to  process  these  files  by  single,
group or all devices in network. This feature allows to
reconfigure    all  magnet  system  (or  part  of  it)  of
accelerator  synchronously.  A  file    contains  a  set  of
points  and  embedded  software  calculates  intermediate
points during processing this file. This calculation use a
method of linear interpolation.

CONCLUSION
A set  of  embedded  controllers  for  power  supplies  was
designed and tested. A number of controllers is used in
power  supply  system  of  VEPP-5,  FEL.  Using    of  the
embedded  controllers  has  minimized  interconnection,
simplified  maintenance  and  reduced  commissioning
time. We suppose to extend this approach to other large
installation of institute.

ABSRACT:

We describe an AC method for the measurement of the longitudinal (Sxx) and transverse
(Sxy,  i.e.  Nernst)  thermopower  of  mm-size  single  crystal  samples  at  low  temperatures
(T<1 K) and high magnetic fields (B>30 T). A low-frequency (33 mHz) heating method
is used to increase the resolution, and to determine the temperature  gradient reliably in
high magnetic fields. Samples are mounted between two thermal blocks which are heated
by a sinusoidal frequency f0 with a π/2 phase difference. The phase difference between
two heater currents gives a temperature gradient at 2f0. The corresponding  thermopower
and Nernst effect signals are extracted by using a digital signal processing method due.
An  important  component  of  the  method  involves  a  superconducting  link,  YBa2Cu3O7+δ
(YBCO)  ,  which  is  mounted  in  parallel  with  sample  to  remove  the  background
magnetothermopower of the lead wires. The method is demonstrated for the quasi two-
dimensional organic conductor α-(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4, which exhibits a  complex,
magnetic field dependent ground state above 22.5 T at low temperatures.

I. INTRODUCTION

The application of a thermal gradient (∆T) across a conducting material leads to a

corresponding  potential  difference,  or  thermo-electric  power  (TEP,  or  thermopower).

Thermopower measurements yield information about both thermodynamic properties and

the transport properties of carriers. Advantages of TEP include the zero-current nature of

the  measurement,  and  its  sensitivity  to  band  structure,  especially  in  the  case  of

anisotropic  (low  dimensional  Fermi  surface)  materials.  Following  Mott  and  Jones,  the

thermopower1 of a metal may be expressed as

where n(E) is the density of the states, v(E) is an average charge velocity, and τ (E) is the

carrier  scattering  relaxation  time.  As  we  will  show  in  the  present  application,  the

derivative  of  n(E)  at  the  Fermi  energy  will  lead  to  large  oscillations  in  systems  where

Landau  quantization  of  the  electronic  energy  levels  occurs  at  high  magnetic  fields2.

Hence  oscillations  in  TEP  associated  with  the  de  Haas  van  Alphen  effect  can  be

observed.

In  a  typical  experimental  setup,  similar  to  that  shown  in  Fig.  1,  a  sample  is

connected between two thermal platforms. A temperature difference is applied by heating

one of the platforms, and ∆T is measured either between the platforms, or at points on the

sample.  The  electric  potential  difference  ∆V  is  measured  with  contact  leads  on  the

sample.  In  general, the  apparatus  is  in  weak  thermal  contact  with  a  reference  bath  at  a

variable temperature T. As with other such measurements on small samples (e.g. specific

2

heat),  the  effects  of  the  addenda,  and  the  magnetic  field  dependence  of  the  sensors,

cannot  be  negelected.  Previous  magneto-thermopower  (hereafter  MTEP)  measurements

at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields have addressed experimental issues such

as the magnetothermopower of lead wires3,4. By using well-studied elemental metal wires

of copper or gold, and high Tc superconductors  (where S = 0 for T << Tc and B << Bc2),

these  background  contributions  may  be  sorted  out.  For  long,  thin  samples  (mm  size

samples  with  10:1  to  100:1  aspect  ratios),  an  AC  technique  has  been  used  to  measure

MTEP for wide range of temperature5. But these techniques cannot be easily adapted to

small single crystals with 1:1 aspect ratios, as in the case of the quasi-two dimensional

“ET” organic conductors (see results section), where an accurate determination of ∆T in

high  magnetic  fields  becomes  difficult.  Resel  et  al.  introduced  a  MTEP  measurement

technique up to 17 Tesla and down to 3K where chromel-constantan thermocouples are

used as voltage and ∆T leads simultaneously6. Their technique (as does ours) includes the

alternate  heating  method  ("seesaw  heating")  to  increase  the  measurement  accuracy.

However, there are limits in their methods in the case of small samples, since the large

absolute  TEP  of  chromel  wire  can  introduce  substantial  background  signal,  and  the

application  of  a  thermocouple  junction  directly  to  a  small  sample,  can  cause

complications.

The technique to be introduced in this paper utilizes a stable, alternating heating

method  at  very  low  frequency.  Here  the  lead  wires  are  in-situ  calibrated  using  a

YBa2Cu3O7+δ high Tc superconductor sample as a reference. When combined with digital

signal processing methods, our procedure leads to enhanced resolution and accuracy for

the MTEP of small samples, with direct application to high magnetic field measurements.

II. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE

A. Measurement setup

 Fig.  1  shows  the  schematic  diagram  of  the  MTEP  and  the  Nernst  effect  measurement

holder  in  a  top-view,  where  the  magnetic  field  is  applied  normal  to  the  plane  of  the

figure. The apparatus is held in a 10 mm diameter cylindrical copper holder that is sealed

with a copper cap (with a threaded grease seal). The copper holder can be maintained at

any temperature T between 300 K  and 0.5 K in a standard cryogenic, high-field dewar

arrangement.  The  integrity  of  the  seal  is  checked  by  a  small  jump  in  an  applied

temperature gradient of the apparatus when the encapsulated air in the holder condenses

out below 80 K. Since  3He exchange gas is used to cool the holder, superfluid leaks do

not present a problem. Samples are mounted between two quartz blocks (2.9 x 2.4 x 1.0

mm3), A and B, with the ends attached using Apiezon N grease7. Electrical contacts to the

samples  are  made  by  12.5 µm  gold  wires  using  silver  (or  carbon)  paste.  The  electrical

connection  between  the  lead  wires  and  the  external  wires  is  kept  in  an  isothermal

condition  by  thermally  anchoring  them  to  the  copper  holder.  Chromel-Au(Fe0.07%)

thermocouple wires7, used to measure ∆T between the quartz blocks, are attached to the

quartz blocks using Stycast 2850 GT epoxy8. To minimize the experimental inaccuracy,

which  may  result  from  the  difference  of  temperature  between  the  quartz  block  and  the

sample,  the  temperature  gradient  was  produced  by  heating  quartz  blocks  at  a  low

frequency of order 33 mHz. Two chip resistor heaters (220 Ω RuO2 miniature surface-

mount resistors) are attached by Stycast 2850 GT epoxy8 to the edge of quartz blocks to

enhance the homogeneous heat conduction.

4

 Two sinusoidal currents are applied by Keithley 220 programmable DC current

sources9 with same frequency f0 but with a π/2 phase difference. The relation between the

two heater currents and ∆T for ideal system (perfect heat conduction from the heater to

the quartz block) is the following:

where I1, I2 are heater currents, R is heater resistance, Cp is the heat capacity of the quartz

block and t is the time. The validity of last expression in Eq. (2), i.e. the assumption of

equal power for both heaters, can be checked by the Fourier analysis of the voltage signal

of thermocouple wires. If the values of R and Cp are not identical, ∆T will oscillate with

frequency of 2f0  and f0 as follows;

By the spectrum analysis of ∆T through the Fourier transform, two peaks will appear at

f=f0 and f=2f0. One can estimate the contribution of the non-identical heat transfer (~δ/A)

from the ratio of amplitudes of peaks. For our holder, the value was found to be about

0.02. Even the contribution from the non-identical heat transfer is substantial, it can be

dealt with by an appropriate analysis of the signal, as discussed below. For the present

case,  we  consider  only  the  dominant  2f0  contribution.  Since  ∆T  oscillates  with  2f0

frequency, corresponding  TEP  and  the  Nernst  voltage  will  also  oscillate  with  the  same

frequency. This second harmonic detection has an advantage in reducing electrical cross-

talk which may arise from single harmonic generation in the heaters.

5

 

Figs.  2a  and  2b  show  the  applied  heater  currents  and  the  corresponding

thermoelectric potential ∆V1 and the thermocouple emf ∆V2 as a function of the time. (∆V1

and ∆V2 refer to voltage leads 1 and 2 as shown in Fig. 1.)  ∆V2 , the measured emf of the

Chromel-Au(Fe0.07%) thermocouple, is related to ∆T by ∆V2  = - ∆T ×SCh-AuFe  +  Voffset,

where SCh-AuFe is the TEP of Chromel-Au(Fe0.07%) thermocouples7 and Voffset is the offset

voltage which lies in the range of 0.1 ~ 0.2 µV at low temperature. ∆V1 and ∆V2 were measured

with Keithley 2182 nanovoltmeters9. There is a slight phase difference (~ 14 degrees or

about 0.6 s delay) between ∆T and ∆V2 due to the non-ideal heat conduction. However,

since  the  signals  are  digitally  averaged  over  2  ½  periods  (see  below)  to  obtain  the

amplitudes of ∆T and ∆V2, the phase difference does not enter into the final TEP value.

When ∆T is small compared to the measurement temperature T, the absolute TEP (Sxx)

and Nernst voltage (Sxy) can be expressed as :

where  SAu is the absolute thermopower of Au and P is either +1 or –1 depending on the

phase difference between V1(V3) and V2. SAu can be determined from the measurement of

another sample (YBCO in this paper) whose value is known at a certain temperature and

magnetic field. For the Nernst voltage, it is assumed that sample alignment is ideal so that

there  is  no  contribution  from  Sxx.  When  the  misalignment  is  substantial,  Sxy  can  be

6

obtained  from  the  difference  in  the  Nernst  voltage  for  two  magnetic  field  sweeps  with

opposite polarities.

The  amplitude  of  oscillation  (V1  and  V2  in  Fig.  2)  can  be  determined  from  the  discrete

values (∆Vi) by the following formula10 :

(5)-2

The Hanning window was used to separate AC signal from DC signal (Voffset), and hence

the signal was compensated for the windowing effect by a multiplicative constant (8/3 in

this case). Finally the root mean square value was used to extract an amplitude of the AC

signal. Because this method does not discriminate oscillations with different frequencies

(for  example,  dominant  2f0  signal  and  f0  signal  from  non-identical  heat  transfer),  this

method has an advantage that the non-identical heat transfer term can be also considered.

However, if there is a substantial low frequency noise, one should use digital bandpass

filters or FFT analysis to obtain the amplitudes.

We note that there have been previous AC TEP measurements using the 2f0 mode

by  Kettler  et  al.11,  where  limitations  due  to  the  heat  capacity  of  the  material  and  the

characteristic times of thermal relaxation were identified. To overcome these problems,

the excitation frequency 2f0 should be as small as possible. In our measurement setup, 2f0

7

was chosen to be 67 mHz, i. e., the oscillation period of the heater currents is 30 seconds,

and the corresponding oscillation period of ∆T is 15 seconds. Our method for determining

the frequency range where the AC and ideal DC methods coincide is shown in Fig. 2c. A

suitable excitation frequency range for the apparatus in Fig. 1 is for 2f0 below 100 mHz.

Above 100 mHz, the AC TEP increases as a function of frequency due to various thermal

relaxation rates which are characteristic of the apparatus.

B. Measurements in magnetic field

 The difficulties for the MTEP measurement comes from the field dependence of SAu(B)

and SCh-AuFe(B). To avoid the problem of SCh-AuFe (B), we exploit the high reproducibility

of ∆T for corresponding constant amplitudes of the heater currents. V2 changes very little

with time during a measurement for fixed temperature (typically less than 1 mK over a 20

minute period of measurement). Correspondingly, the change of ∆T is also very small for

magnetic field sweeps , with less than 1% deviation in ∆T as compared with the zero field

value  .  The  change  of ∆T  will  come  from  the  field  dependence  of  specific  heat  of  the

quartz block and the magnetoresistance of the heater resistor. The former is negligible for

the  quartz  block  and  the  latter  can  be  calibrated  at  each  magnetic  field.  Although  the

magnetoresistance (MR = R(B)/R(B=0)) of the chip resistor used in this measurement is

very  small  (  for  30  T  :  ~  -1.5%  at  4K,  ~  -1.4%  at  1.1K,  ~  -2.0  %  at  0.7  K),  we  also

included the MR effect in the determination of ∆T (T, B). Once ∆T(T, B) is determined,

SAu(B)  can  be  easily  measured  using  a  YBCO  sample  as  a  reference  below  its  critical

field, where SYBCO(B) = 0. Therefore the MTEP and Nernst voltage can be written as

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

To  demonstrate  the  techniques  described  here,  we  consider  the  MTEP  and  the

Nernst effect of organic conductor α-(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4 . The material α-(BEDT-

TTF)2KHg(SCN)4  is  a  well  known  quasi  two-dimensional  organic  conductor12  which

shows metal - density wave transition around T = 8 K, and which has a magnetoresistance

anomaly  at  22.5  T  (below  8  K)  where  there  is  a  magnetic  field  induced  change  in  the

electronic structure. The typical size of the sample is about 1.4×0.6×0.26 mm3 , with a

plate-like morphology. The sample is mounted so that the temperature gradient is in the

plane of the conducting layers (a or c-axis), with the field perpendicular to the conducting

layers (b-axis). A polycrystalline YBCO sample, of comparable dimensions, was used for

in-situ calibration. The sample holder was attached to the probe of 3He cryostat and a 30

9

T resistive magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory was used for the high

field measurements.

 Fig. 3 shows zero field TEP results for the crystallographic a- and c-axis, i.e. ∆T

is parallel with a- and c-axis respectively. As mentioned in the introduction, the TEP is

sensitive to the anisotropy of the band structure (and therefore the Fermi surface), hence

it depends on the direction of ∆T with respect to the crystallographic axes. Structure in

the TEP, due to the opening of a partial gap, is clearly seen around 8K for both axes. The

sum of the amount of jump is about 1 µV/K, which is in reasonable agreement with the

heat capacity measurement results13.

 For MTEP and the Nernst effect measurement, the magnetic field is swept very

slowly (0.042 T/min) for fixed temperatures. Fig 4 (a) shows the raw data of ∆V1, ∆V2

and ∆V3 for T = 0.7 K. When the heater power is about 220 µW, ∆T is 0.085K at zero

field and it is assumed to decrease to 0.083 K at B = 27 T due to the negative MR of the

chip resistor. The oscillation of V1 and V3 is huge and the change of polarity (P(T, B) of

Eq. (4) and(6))can be also seen from the raw data.. The derived MTEP data are shown in

Fig. 4 (b). Each MTEP data point is obtained using Eq. (5) - (7) by averaging over ~ 100

raw data points.

 Fig.  5  shows  the  Nernst  voltage  (Sxy)  for  positive  and  negative  magnetic  field

sweep  and  the  corresponding  Nernst  effect  at  T  =  1.4K.  For  this  case,  the  xy  sample

electrode  alignment  is  quite  good  and  quantum  oscillations  can  be  clearly  seen,  even

though the final results are obtained by subtracting Sxy (B<0) from Sxy (B>0), and dividing

by 2. The corresponding period of quantum oscillations can be obtained from the Fourier

10

transform, and it is found to be ~ 670 T, which agrees with the value measured from the

magnetoresistance and magnetization experiments14.

Finally,  we  describe  the  MTEP  of  the  thermocouple  (Chromel-AuFe)  and

electrical (Au) leads used in the present study. This is done under the assumption that ∆T

depends only on the heater power (taking into account the negative MR), and assuming

that  the  magnetic  field  effect  on  the  heat  capacity  of  quartz  and  stycast  epoxy  is

negligible.  Then,  for  a  fixed  heater  power  (∆T)  and  temperature  T, ∆V4  on  the  YBCO

sample and ∆V2 on the quartz blocks are measured as a function of magnetic field. SAu(T,

B)  can  then  be  determined  directly,  and  from  Eq.  (7),  we  can  determine  SCh-AuFe(T,  B).

Fig. 6 shows the results at different temperatures as a function of the magnetic field. For

the  MTEP  of  SCh-AuFe,  the  overall  behavior 

is  quite  similar 

to 

the  previous

determinations15 in which the MTEP was measured by a different method up to B = 14 T.

Fig. 2. a) Heater currents and b) ∆V1(∆V2)  as a function of the time. The period of the

heating cycle is 30 seconds and the corresponding periods of oscillation of temperature

gradient and thermopower signal are 15 seconds. c) SAC/SDC vs. frequency method used

Fig.  3.  Zero-field  thermopower  results  of  α-(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4  as  a  function  of

temperature. A gap opens in the quasi-one dimensional part of the Fermi surface near 8

K, which is seen as a peak in the a-axis data. Filled circles : ∆T || a-axis, open circles : ∆T

|| c-axis.

Fig. 4. Magnetothermopower. (a) ∆V1, ∆V2 and ∆V3 curves under magnetic field for α-

(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4 at T = 0.7 K. (b) Derived magnetothermopower results. Note

the narrow range of field in (a) , which corresponds to only a few quantum oscillations in

(b).

Fig. 5. Nernst effect. a) Sxy signal of α-(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4 for normal and reversed

field  sweeps  at  T=1.4  K.  The  large  asymmetry,  even  in  the  raw  data,  indicates  a

14

significant  xy  component  of  the  thermopower.  b)  Corresponding  Nernst  voltage  (=

The optical properties of a concentric nanometer-sized spherical shell comprised 
of  an  (active)  3-level  gain  medium  core  and  a  surrounding  plasmonic  metal  shell  are 
investigated.  Current  research  in  optical  metamaterials  has  demonstrated  that  including 
lossless  plasmonic  materials  to  achieve  a  negative  permittivity  in  a  coated  nano-sized 
spherical shell particle can lead to novel optical properties such as resonant scattering as 
well as transparency or invisibility.   However, in practice, plasmonic materials have high 
losses at optical frequencies. It is observed that with the introduction of active materials, 
the  intrinsic  absorption  in  the  plasmonic  shell  can  be  overcome  and  new  optical 
properties can be observed in the scattering and absorption cross-sections of these coated 
nano-sized spherical shell particles. In addition, a “super” resonance is observed with a 
310   greater  than  that  for  a  tuned,  resonant  passive  nano-sized  coated 
magnitude  that  is
spherical  shell.    This  observation  suggests  the  possibility  of  realizing  a  highly  sub-
wavelength laser with dimensions more than an order of magnitude  below the traditional 
half-wavelength cavity length criteria.  The operating characteristics of this coated nano-
particle (CNP) laser are obtained numerically for a variety of configurations.

 I. Introduction 
 

Optical metamaterials show the potential for realizing new, interesting and useful optical 
phenomena  that  can  be  designed  to  meet  specific  applications  [1].  To  realize  some  of  the 
interesting properties of optical metamaterials, it is necessary for the electric permittivity (ENG 
metamaterials) or the magnetic permeability (MNG metamaterials) or even both of them (DNG 
metamaterials) to take on negative real values [2].  One of the conveniences of nature is that there 
are naturally occurring materials exhibiting negative permittivities at optical frequencies. On the 
other hand, one of the major obstacles in realizing metamaterials at optical frequencies is the lack 
of naturally occurring media exhibiting any magnetic response. It has been shown at microwave 
frequencies  that  a  magnetic  dipole  moment  can  be  induced  and  overall  magnetic  responses 
realized  by  imbedding  in  a  non-magnetic  host  material,  inclusions  made  from  non-magnetic 
materials of appropriate designs (parallel nano-wires, split ring resonators, etc).  It has also been 
demonstrated  theoretically  that  by  arranging  nano-spheres  in  a  ring  configuration  to  create  an 
“optical nano-circuit” [3], a magnetic dipole moment can be realized at optical frequencies via the 
displacement  current  induced  in  the  ring  by  the  incident  optical  field.  Other  interesting  and 
desirable optical properties of nano-shells, which also require the use of negative permittivity and 
have  been  demonstrated,  include  resonant  source  and  scattering  configurations  [4],  as  well  as 
transparency and invisibility [5], [6]. Using the polarizability of the individual inclusions, one can 
realize  effective  electric  permittivities  and  magnetic  permeabilities 
the 
electromagnetic response for waves interacting with the medium.  

that  govern 

Recent  work  on  resonant  electrically-small  concentric  nano-spherical  shells  [7]-[9]  has 
demonstrated  that  these  structures  have  highly  tunable  polarizabilities,  thus  making  them 
attractive  candidates  for  use  as  inclusions  in  potential  realizations  of  optical  metamaterials. 
Current nano-fabrication capabilities have been used to successfully synthesize nano-shells, and 
many  of  their  optical  properties  have  verified  experimentally  [7].  To  achieve  the  resonant 
tunability  of  spherical  nano-shells  at  optical  frequencies,  one  must  incorporate  plasmonic 
materials,  such  as  metals,  in  the  shells.  Unfortunately,  the  polarizability  of  these  structures  is 
dominated  by  high  losses  at  optical  frequencies  due  to  the  absorption  in  these  plasmonic 
materials.  In  an  attempt  to  counter  these  intrinsic  losses  we  have  investigated  the  use  of  active 
media in multi-layered spherical plasmonic nano-shells.   

We  have  used  passive  media  models  based  on  lossy  dispersive  materials  to  match  the 
demonstrated properties of successfully synthesized passive plasmonic nano-shells.  We have also 
developed  active  media  models  for  several  optical  gain  materials  that  have  been  successfully 
incorporated  into  these  passive  materials.    We  have  then  used  these  optical  gain  media  to 
investigate  their  ability  to  overcome  the  losses  associated  with  the  spherical  plasmonic  nano-
shells.  We will demonstrate that a properly designed passive optical spherical core impregnated 
with  a  gain  medium  and  coated  with  a  concentric  spherical  plasmonic  nano-shell  will  have  a 
lasing  state.  The  operating  characteristics  of  this  coated  nano-particle  (CNP)  laser  have 
been obtained numerically for a variety of configurations and will be reported here.

II. Electrically Small Resonant Scattering Structures  
 
IIa. Mie Theory  
 
The theory of plane wave scattering from an isotropic sphere was originally presented by Mie and 
extended to the more general case of concentric spherical shells by Aden [10] and others. For a 
linearly polarized plane wave incident on a concentrically layered spherical particle, the electric 
and magnetic fields in each region can be expanded into vector spherical harmonics. Enforcing 
the  electromagnetic  boundary  conditions,  i.e.,  the  continuity  of  the  tangential  electric  and 
magnetic fields at each interface, the scattered field coefficients are obtained.   

From  the  scattered  field  and  incident  field  the  scattering  cross-section  and  absorption 
cross-section  are  defined  via  Poynting’s  theorem.  The  scattering  cross-section  is  defined  as  the 
total integrated power contained in the scattered field normalized by the irradiance of the incident 
field and the absorption cross-section is defined by the net flux through a surface surrounding the 
concentric shells normalized by the incident field irradiance, and is thus a measure of how much 
energy is absorbed by the concentric shell structure. The absorption and scatter cross-sections can 
be expressed via Poynting’s theorem through the following expressions:

where S is a sphere that surrounds the particle and  ˆn  is the unit outward pointing normal to that

respectively.  The  total  scattering  cross-section,  absorption  cross-section  and  extinction  cross-
section can also be expressed in terms of the scattered field coefficients as:

The  scattered  field  coefficients  can  be  determined  by  solving  a  system  of  equations 
derived  from  matching  the  tangential  components  of  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  at  the 
boundaries  of  the  inner  and  outer  surface  of  the  spherical  shell  as  in  [10].  The  resulting  matrix

As indicated, the scattering matrix can be expressed as a block diagonal matrix with sub-
matricies which individually describe the TE and TM fields.  Consequently, the TE and 
TM scattered field coefficients can be obtained independently. Applying Cramer’s rule, 
the scattered field coefficients can be expressed as the ratio of determinants:

  and 
explicitly  on  the  material  functions  ε  and  μ  in  each  region;  the  inner  and  outer  radii  of  the 
CNP  shell:  1r   and 
2r ;    and  the  wavelength.  It  is  apparent  that  when  the  determinant  in  the 
denominator approaches a minimum, a resonance in the scattering parameters of these CNPs and, 
as a result, for example, their total cross-section can occur.  It has been shown [7], [8], [11] that 
the resonance condition depends on the ratio of the core radius to the total particle radius as well 
as on the properties of the core, shell and surrounding medium. Aside from their existence, a very 
attractive characteristic of these electrically-small resonances is their explicit dependence on the 
shell radii. This property allows for the tunability of their frequencies by changing the geometry. 
Consequently, these tunable electrically-small resonances are of interest when considering these 
CNPs for applications, as well as for inclusions in optical metamaterials. The design of the CNP’s 
described  below  was  thus  accomplished  for  a  desired  value  of  the  resonance  wavelength  by 
determining  the  radii  ratio  for  given  core  and  shell  materials.  To  illustrate  the  design  and

At 
,  it is seen that the denominator in the TM coefficients attains a minimum at the 
radii ratio, Rr = 0.8, which corresponds, respectively, to a core radius and outer radius of 24nm 
and  30nm.  This  minimum  coincides  with  the  maximum  in  the  TM  scattering  coefficients 
. 
We note that this minimum is caused by the fact that the imaginary part of the determinant goes 
to zero at this radii ratio while there is no dramatic change in the real part.  Notice that the TE 
na ,  do  not  exhibit  a  resonance,  but  they  do have  a  maximally  reduced 
scattering  coefficients, 
resonance near the radii ratio of 0.97.   Similarly, 
 has a maximally reduced resonance near 
the  radii  ratio  0.95.  Such  non-scattering  states  have  recently  gained  attention  for  use  in 
metamaterials  for  achieving  invisibility  [5].  The  wavelength  tunability  of  the  electrically 
small resonances associated with varying the radii ratio of the CNPs is demonstrated In 
Figure  2,  with  the  silver-silica  CNP.  Due  to  the  losses  inherent  in  silver,  as  will  be 
discussed  below,  the  designs  favorable  for  active  CNPs  using  silver  shells  fall 
near
.  Thus we have selected the radii ratio of Rr=0.8 for all of the silver-based 
CNP simulations reported here.

IIb. Resonant Electrically Small Spheres  
 

In  recent  years  there  have  been  several  investigations  on  the  effects  of  multi-layered 
metamaterial  spheres  and  their  use  for  enhancing  electromagnetic  phenomena.  At  radio  and 
microwave frequencies, it has been shown that large enhancements are attainable in the radiated 
power  from  a  dipole  antenna  located  arbitrarily  near  to  or  centrally  within  concentric  spherical 
metamaterial shells [9], [12,13,14], . In addition to enhancing the radiated power it has also been 
found that there are situations where there is a drastic reduction in the radiated power from the 
dipole  antenna,  i.e.,  there  exist  not  only  enhanced  radiating  states  but  also  non-radiating  states 
[11], [15]. 

Analogous  to  the  radiated  power  enhancements  obtained  with  concentric  spherical 
metamaterial  shells,  it  has  also  been  shown  that  there  are  reciprocal  enhanced  scattering  states 
[13]. These resonant scattering states have been recognized previously [7], [11]. Analogous to the 
non-radiating states associated with the radiating dipole antenna in the presence of a metamaterial 
shell, extremely low scattering states also exist. In fact a great deal of recent attention has been 
given very recently to the so-called “transparency” or “invisibility” effect [5], [6], [8].   

 

IIc. Optical Excitations  

 

 
Recent  work  has  investigated  the  use  of  optically  tunable  resonant  nano-spheres  for 
biomedical  and  optical  applications.  Projected  uses  for  these  nano-shells  range  from  exploiting 
their  tunability  for  contrast  agents  in  early  cancer  detection  [16],  [17]  and  for  drug  delivery,  to 
creating near infrared, highly absorbing particles for use in a photo thermal ablation therapy for 
cancer  treatment  [17].  Optically  tunable  plasmonic  nano-shells  have  been  successfully 
synthesized with spherical dielectric cores surrounded by thin metallic coatings for a number of 
years.  Dielectric-core  gold  nano-shells  have  been  successfully  synthesized,  and  their  optical 
tunability  has  been  verified  experimentally  [7].  In  these  particles  gold  nano-shells  with 
thicknesses as thin as 2nm surround a gold sulfide AuS2 core. Tunability from 550nm to 950nm 
was  demonstrated  using  particle  radii  ranging  from  4nm  to  17nm,  respectively.    Tunable  gold 
nano-shells  made  with  a  silica  core  have  also  been  successfully  synthesized  and  their  optical 
properties  experimentally  verified  [17].  Tunability  was  demonstrated  for  larger  spheres  with  a 

 

6

60nm core size and shell thicknesses ranging from 5nm to 20nm to cover the wavelength range 
from 750nm to 1000nm in which the resonance was  observed to shift to longer wavelengths as 
the core to shell radius ratio increased.  In addition to gold-silica nano-shells, silver coated silica 
nano-shells  with  core  radii  of  40-250nm  and  shell  thicknesses  of  10-  30nm  have  also  been 
successfully synthesized and optical properties experimentally verified. [18]. It was demonstrated 
that  these  silver-silica  nano-shells  exhibit  tunable  plasmon  resonances  at  shorter  wavelengths 
with  a  10%  larger  enhancement  than  for  gold-silica  nano-shells  and,  therefore,  can  be  used  to 
cover a wider portion of the optical spectrum. 
 
IId. Nano-Scatterers  
 

In this section the optical characteristics of nano-shells will be discussed in more detail. 
Optical nano-shells possess tunable resonances where the enhancements in the extinction cross-
section  are  attributed  to  the  optical  field  coupling to  plasmon  modes  of  the  metal  shell.    In  the 
cases  of  lossless  materials  the  extinction  cross-section  is  dominated  by  light  scattered  by  the 
particle  and  is  equal  to  the  scattering  cross-section.  Material  absorption  must  be  present  for  a 
finite absorption cross-section and only then will it contribute to the extinction cross-section of 
the particle.  When material absorption is present enhancements in the absorption cross-section of 
the particle can occur as well. The intrinsic properties dominate the extinction in the quasi-static 
regime ka<<1, where the scattering cross-section and absorption cross-section are dominated by 
the dipole terms. Differences in the contributions to the extinction cross-section from scattering 
and  absorption  result  from  extrinsic  and  intrinsic  optical  properties  of  the  nano-shells.  Intrinsic 
effects dominate in the quasi-static regime and extrinsic effects become non-negligible for nano-
shells  with  dimensions  larger  than  the  quasi-static  limit.  Larger  spheres  that  incorporate  lossy 
materials  tend  to  be  dominated  by  scattering  and  less  by  absorption  when  compared  to  smaller 
nano-shells  of  similar  structure.  Nano-shells  which  fall  into  the  quasi-static  regime  are  mostly 
dominated by absorption due to predominant coupling to the lowest order dipole plasmon mode. 
For larger spheres, phase retardation effects are more significant and therefore optical fields can 
couple  to  higher  order  plasmon  resonances,  which  correspond  to  higher  order  multipole  fields. 
This increase in coupling between the optical field and plasmons modes of the nano-shell results 
in extinction cross-sections dominated by scattering rather than by absorption for larger particles.  
[19], [20] The extinction cross-section spectrum in these two size regimes is different as well. For 
smaller  spheres  only  one  plasmonic  resonance  is  dominant.    On  the  other  hand,  for  a  larger 
particle  not  in  the  quasi-static  regime,  i.e.,  where  ka~>1,  higher  order  plasmon  resonances 
corresponding  to  higher  order  multipoles  can  be  excited  in  the  scattered  fields.    Consequently, 
multiple resonances can occur. Due to the increases in the scattering and phase retardation effects, 
the widths of the resonances are wider in larger particles than they are for smaller spheres [19], 
[20].  Such  differences  in  absorption  and  scattering  are  of  importance  when  considering  lossy 
plasmonic nano-shells for optical regime applications. 
 
In  our  investigations  of  active  nano-shells  we  felt  it  was  important  to  consider  optical 
materials  that  not  only  have  properties  suitable  for  realizing  resonant  nano-shells,  but  that  also 
have been shown to be realistically synthesized into nano-shells. As mentioned above nano-shells 
have been successfully created using combinations of gold and silver as materials for the metal 
shells and of gold sulfide and silica as the dielectric core material. For this reason we have used 
silver, gold and silica in our models. In modeling these nano-shells both the extrinsic and intrinsic 
optical properties of these nano-sized particles must be considered.

III. Optical Material Properties 
 
IIIa. Passive media 
 

Due to the nano-scale dimensions of the particles under investigation, accurate modeling 
of  the  optical  properties  of  the  nano-shells  requires  that  one  takes  into  account  the  size 
dependence of the materials used in making these structures. The size dependence of the optical 
properties of nano-scale particles can be classified as either extrinsic, i.e., if the size effects arise 
predominantly from electro-dynamic effects, or intrinsic, i.e., if there is an actual change in the 
optical response of the materials that comprise the particle. In our layered nano-particles the gold 
and  silver  plasmonic  shells  exhibit  significant  intrinsic  size  dependencies.  We  have  used 
empirically determined bulk values for the permittivity of gold and silver at optical wavelengths 
between  200nm  to  1800nm  [21],  [22].  Following  the  approach  in  [20],  the  permittivity  is 
decomposed  into  a  size  dependent  Drude  response  and  an  interband  transition  response  as 
follows:

The size dependence is treated as an effect which arises when the size of the material approaches 
the  bulk  mean  free  path  length  of  the  conduction  electrons  in  the  material.  It  is  treated  as  an 
alteration  in  the  mean  free  path  which  is  then  incorporated  into  the  Drude  model  as  a  size 
dependent bulk damping frequency.  In particular, the damping frequency is assumed to take the

In  addition  to  increasing  the  real  part  of  the  permittivity,  the  most  significant  size 
dependent  effect  of  consequence  for  considering  resonant  nano-shells  is  the  large  increase  in 
optical loss as the material size decreases to dimensions on the order of tens of nanometers. This 
is  shown  in  Figures  3  and  4,  for  both  gold  and  silver.  The  blue  line  in  each  figure  depicts  the 
permittivity values for the bulk metal, and the black lines indicate increasing material dimensions 
ranging from 2-100nm.  The figures indicate that as the dimension decreases, the magnitude of 
the real and imaginary parts increase.  Due to the reduction of the mean free path of the Drude 
electrons in the thin nanometer thick shells, the collision frequency increases.  Therefore, more of 
the  kinetic  energy  is  dissipated  as  heat,  which  results  in  an  increase  in  the  optical  loss.  This 
increased optical loss must be taken into account when one chooses an appropriate medium with 
sufficient gain to compensate for the losses of the size dependent plasmonic shells.

Figure 4. Size dependence of the permittivity of silver. 
 
 
The size dependence of the plasmonic metal shells alters the resonance characteristics of 
a  passive  nano-shell.    The  most  notable  effect  is  a  broadening  of  the  resonance  and  a 
corresponding  reduction  in  its  strength.  When  a  bulk  dielectric  function  is  used  for  the  shell 
model, the position of the resonance in not significantly affected by the size dependent properties. 
Comparing the bulk and size dependent models of the shells, one finds that the resonance position 
of  the  complete  model  is  shifted  significantly  when  the  interband  transition  contributions  are 
neglected and only the Drude component of permittivity is considered. This property is shown in 
Figures 5 and 6, where the absorption and scattering efficiencies for gold coated and silver coated 
silica  passive  nano-shells  are  shown.    The  results  for  the  Drude,  bulk,  and  size  dependent 
permittivity  models  are  presented.    Because  of  the  large  amplitude  differences  in  these  cases, 
these efficiency values were also normalized to one.  These normalized values are also presented 
in these figures; they clearly show the locations of the resonances predicted with these models. 
The size dependent effects are seen in both the scattering and absorption cross-sections. For the 
r =
Au-SiO2  case,  the  shell  thickness  is  2nm  with  1
,  while  the  shell 
r =
thickness  is  6nm  for  the  Ag-SiO2  case  with  1
.    These  results 
strongly  emphasize  that  using  only  a  size-independent  Drude  model  to  simulate  the  material 
properties of a CNP neglects important physical effects which significantly impact its scattering 
and absorption efficiencies.

In  modeling  active  nano-shells  we  have  considered  both  canonical  gain  models  and 
models that resemble those which have been successfully incorporated into materials used in the 
synthesis of passive optical nano-shells. For our investigations of the core permittivity parameter 
space  for  the  theoretical  gain  medium,  we  have  used  a  general  permittivity  model  described  in 
terms of the refractive index and the optical loss. The permittivity in this model is thus defined as:

In  this  model  the  real  part  of  the  refractive  index,  n,  is  maintained  at  the  silica  index  value  of 
1.413. The imaginary part is varied over a range of values that represent the expected loss or gain 
in the core of the nano-shell. The results obtained by using such a model will be presented below 
where it will be shown that there exist resonance states of enormously enhanced radiated power 
for certain coordinates in the refractive index and optical gain parameter space.

IIIb. Active media 
 

Many rare-earth ions are known that can be used as dopants in a dielectric host material 
to achieve optical gain. These ions can provide gain over different wavelength regions spanning 
from the visible to the near infrared [23]. In telecommunication technologies, for instance, doping 
silica with the rare-earth ion Erbium3+ has been proven as an effective means of realizing gain in 
a silica host material for some time. In our models we have introduced gain through the electric 
susceptibility. Due to the well understood optical characteristics, we have focused on erbium as a 
guiding  model  for  our  silica  based  gain  media.  Near  the  widely  used  1550nm    4I13/2  -  4I15/2, 
transition, erbium doped silica can be considered as a three level Stark-split atomic system, and 
its electric susceptibility has been modeled accurately with experimentally determined absorption 
cross-sections  [24],  [25].    As  will  be  shown  in  the  following  sections,  the  gain  available  from 
erbium near 1550nm is too small to compensate for the losses due to a gold shell throughout the 
simulation  wavelength  range  of  200-1600nm.  Silver,  however,  has  significantly  smaller  losses 
than  gold  in  regions  in  this  wavelength  range;  and,  thus,  the  available  gain  of  an  erbium-like 
system  is  sufficient  to  compensate  for  the  associated  losses  for  wavelengths  around  500nm. 
Therefore,  we  will  be  generalizing  the  susceptibility  model  of  erbium  at  1550nm  to  500nm  in 
order to keep our gain values within the limits of those for erbium-like systems.   

The  total  complex  optical  susceptibility  can  expressed  as  a  sum  of  the  background 
susceptibility due to the host material and additional contributions due to the erbium ions via the 
total material polarization,  TP ,

When  the  time  scale  of  the  atomic  excitation  is  long  compared  to  the  time  of  the  thermally

susceptibility  can  be  expressed  as  a  superposition  of  the  atomic  susceptibilities  associated  with 
each level in the stark  manifold [24],  [25] . The result is an expression for the susceptibility in 
terms of the absorption and emission cross-sections for the erbium ions. The real and imaginary 
parts  of  the  susceptibility  are  related  to  the  absorption  and  emission  cross-sections  via  the 
expressions:

IV. Coated Nano-Particles  
 

We have investigated the optical properties of nano-shells comprised of gold and silver 
shells and active core materials modeled as rare-earth doped SiO2. In the following sections the 
optical properties of these active CNPs will be presented and compared to the passive case of a 
pure  silica  core.  For  passive  CNPs  with  lossy  plasmonic  shells,  the  extinction  cross-section  is 
dominated by absorption. This is true even for very thin shells, when the shell thickness is much 
less than the total particle radius. Examples of this are shown in Figure 8, for the cases of an Au-
SiO2 CNP with a shell thickness of 2nm, and for an Ag-SiO2 CNP with a shell thickness of 6nm.  
For these and all of the following results, the size dependence of the metal shells and its impact 
on the permittivity was taken into account. We will show that active materials can compensate for 
these losses and even overcome them so that the resulting extinction cross-section is dominated 
entirely  by  radiated  power.  In  addition,  we  will  show  that  in  this  regime  where  the  extinction 
cross-section is dominated by the radiation, optical phenomena exist which we have interpreted as 
the onset of lasing in an active CNP.  

 
 
 

 
Figure  8.  Comparisons  of  the  contributions  of  the  scattering  and  absorption  efficiencies 
demonstrate that the total efficiency in passive Au-SiO2 and Ag-SiO2 CNPs is dominated by the 
absorption.  
 

 

 

IVb. Active CNPs 

 
To model the active CNPs with the canonical active permittivity given by Eq. (12), the 
index of silica was taken to be n=1.43 and the amount of optical loss, k, was varied for the lossy 
cases: -1 ≤ k ≤0 in order to cover the domain of the passive CNPs and to explore the incremental 
changes in the scattering properties. The scattering and absorption cross-sections were calculated 
for both Au-SiO2 and Ag-SiO2 CNPs. The Au coated NP had a core radius  1
and a 
2nm thick shell, and the Ag coated NP had a core radius  1
 and a 6nm shell. . For the 
canonical gain model, results for the Au-SiO2 CNP will be presented here. Plots of the resulting 
scattering  and  absorption  cross-sections  for  the  Au-SiO2  CNP  are  given  in  Figures  9  and  10.  
Similar behavior was observed in the Ag-SiO2 CNP case.

As defined by Eq. (2), the absorption cross-section 

absσ  is a measure of the net outward 
absσ  indicates power lost due to absorption 
power flux scattered from the CNP, where a positive 
within  the  CNP.  Therefore,  a  negative  absorption  cross-section  is  interpreted  as  a  net  power 
leaving the CNP, i.e., the CNP has become a nano-radiator with a projected radiant exitance equal 
absσ  
to the incident irradiance scaled by the extinction efficiency of the CNP. At the point where

becomes  zero,  the  losses  associated  with  the  passive  CNP  have  been  compensated  by  the  gain.  
absσ   becomes  more  negative,  the  total  amount  of  light  leaving  the  region  of  the  CNP 
As 
increases, which means that the scattered radiation is now accompanied by power being radiated 
by  the  active  CNP.  In  the  following,  data  will  be  presented  as  the  scattering  and  absorption 
efficiencies (
 
  

scatQ ), as defined by Eqs. (6), (7), and (8).

As 

absQ  and 

a decrease in 

absQ decreases, 

scatQ  increases.  However, 

scatQ  begins to grow near the point where the value of 

scatQ  does not increase monotonically with 
absQ  
absQ .  One finds that 
scatQ  being affected by gain present in 
goes through zero. In addition to the strength of 
the  core,  the  widths  of  the  scattering  and  absorption  resonances  change  as  well.  As  the  gain 
scatQ  also narrows. As the gain 
absQ  becomes negative, the width of 
increases to the point where 
scatQ   broadens  out  again.  The  narrowest  scattering  resonances  coincide 
scatQ   follows  the  non-
scatQ  as the gain is increased past the point where 
monotonic nature of the maximum values of 
the losses associated with the passive CNP are overcome. It is also found that by varying the gain 
in the core, the scattering and absorption efficiencies of the CNP can be adjusted.  Consequently, 
it can be envisioned that by adjusting the pump level applied to the gain medium (for any given 

scatQ   values.  This  narrowing  and  then  broadening  of 

continues  to  increase, 

with  the  largest 

 

 

16

pumping scheme), the absorption of an active CNP and, hence, a metamaterial comprised of such 
active CNPs, could also be adjusted dynamically.  
 
 For  our  Au-Silica  CNP  calculations,  it  was  found  that  as  the  gain  is  increased,  the 
absorption decreases until the value of k is in the neighborhood of -0.67.  In that neighborhood 
absQ  becomes negative while 
 
 

scatQ  increases dramatically.

parameter k. 

 
 
Further investigation of the k values near to where 

scatQ  is maximized shows that 
the resonance of the CNP can become extremely large, i.e., several orders of magnitude 
larger  than  for  any  other  k  values.    In  fact  both 
scatQ   attain  extrema  at  those 
absQ and 
critical values of k. Particularly intriguing is the fact that 
absQ in this region is negative, 
indicating that a large amount of power is radiated from the CNP. Along with the large 
resonances,  the  widths  of  both 
absQ become  extremely  narrow,  going  from 
several hundred nanometers down to only a few tens of nanometers. These features are 
illustrated in Figure 11.

Figure 11.  The absorption and scattering efficiencies for an Au-SiO2 CNP with k slightly 
beyond critical. The narrowing of the width of these efficiencies is immediately apparent.   
 

Both 

scatQ and 

scatQ and 

absQ attain magnitudes on the order of 103, with a full-width-at-half-
maximum (FWHM) of about 10nm. As indicated by the definitions (5) and (8), a measure 
of  the  peak  net  power  leaving  the  vicinity  of  the  CNP  is  calculated  as  the  difference 
absQ , i.e., the total efficiency.  The log (base 10) of the absolute value 
between 
of this total efficiency is plotted as a function of the gain parameter, k, for -1 < k < 0, in 
Figure 12. It is clear from this result that the active CNP resonance passes through a large 
enhancement  over  the  region  -0.8  <  k  <  -0.6,  with  a  large  positive  net  power  being 
radiated away from the CNP. The sharp inflection near the coordinate (-0.7, 1) is due to 
the  total  efficiency  crossing  the  zero  point,  i.e.,  the  point  for  which  the  loses  have  just 
absQ changes from positive to negative values, and our choice to plot 
been overcome and 
the log of the absolute value. The values to the right of this point for k > -0.7 represent a 
negative total efficiency and, therefore, a net absorption by the CNP.

In  fact,  exploring  the  n  and  k  parameter  space  of  the  core  permittivity  model 
 
shows that there is a region where the losses are overcome and a unique region, where the 
super  resonance  is  accompanied  by  a  negative  absorption  cross-section,  is  achieved. 
Figure  13  shows  contour  and  surface  plots  of  the  absorption  cross-section,  scattering 
cross-section  and  total  cross-section  over  the  n-k  parameter  space  for  the  resonance 
wavelength  of  809nm.    The  super  resonance  is  achieved  only  for  values  of  k 
corresponding to gain in the core, and the index n corresponding to the permittivity value 
,  as  well  as  the  geometrical  parameters  needed  for  the  resonances 
2.05
of  SiO2:
associated with the passive CNP.

The  extremely  large  increase  in  the  radiated  power  and  the  drastic  narrowing  of  the 
resonance peak at this super resonance suggests that the active CNP in this regime of the 
gain  values  has  surpassed  mere  optical  amplification  of  the  incident  beam  and  has 
become a CNP laser. However, from the above behavior of the scattering and absorption 
efficiencies  it  is  not  clear  whether  the  CNP  is  in  fact  acting  like  a  laser  resonator.    In 
particular,  is  there  energy  being  stored  in  the  structure  in  the  presence  of  the  optical 
amplification?  Thus,  further  investigations  of  the  resonant  characteristics  in  this  super-
resonance regime, such as the total amount of energy stored in the CNP, were made.  

The total energy of the CNP was calculated as the sum total of the energy stored 
in  shell  and  core  regions.    The  electric  and  magnetic  energy  stored  in  each  region  was 
calculated with the relations:

in

The  CNPs  were  designed  to  have  their  dipole scattering terms be  resonant;  thus 
keeping only the first four terms in the field expansions when evaluating expansion-based 
expressions such as Eq. (24) is sufficient for accurate results.  The following plot of the 
energy stored in the Au-SiO2 CNP was obtained at the resonance wavelength of 809 nm.  

 
Figure 14.  Energy stored in the active Au-SiO2 CNP as a function of the gain parameter 
k. 
 

From  these  calculations  it  is  clear  that  in  comparison  to  the  parameter  values 
outside of the super resonance region, the stored energy within the CNP increases several 
orders of magnitude as the super resonance region is achieved.  Moreover, one finds that 
large amounts of energy are contained within the active core of the CNP as compared to 
the plasmonic shell region.  This can also be visualized with electric and magnetic field 
plots showing the field in the core, shell, and surrounding regions of the CNP at and away 
from the super resonance region.   Electric and magnetic field plots for pump power ratio 
values near to those that yield the super resonance are shown in Figures 15 and 16 where 
the  total  field  is  plotted.  Contour  plots  of  the  Eθ   and  Hφ   components  of  the  super 
resonance field are given in Figure 16; they clearly demonstrate that the super resonance 
field  is  dominated  by  the  dipole  contributions,  and  that  the  fields  within  the  plasmonic 
shell are considerably lower than in the core and near the outer surface of the CNP.

Similar to the scattering and absorption efficiency parameter space plots, the total 
stored energy in the Au-SiO2 CNP is shown as a function of n and k in Figure 17. We 
observe, as we did in the efficiency plots, that there is a unique region where the stored 
energy  is  a  maximum  and  that  this  maximum  is  several  orders  greater  than  the  stored 
energy  values  determined  in  other  regions  of  the  parameter  space.    This  maximum-
stored-energy region coincides with those of the extrema in the scattering and absorption 
efficiencies.    Consequently,  the  active  CNP  is  lasing  in  this  portion  of  the  parameter 
space.

Next the results obtained using a rare-earth doped silica core with an erbium-like 
gain  model  are  presented.      For  the  rare-earth  doped  silica  core,  the  erbium  model  was 
adopted  using  the  experimentally  determined  absorption  and  emission  cross-sections 
mentioned  in  Section  3.    In  exploring  the  use  of  such  gain  media,  the  concentration  of 
rare-earth ions was varied in order to achieve sufficient gain to overcome the losses of the 
passive CNP. To demonstrate the possibility of CNP lasers and keeping within practical 
physical  limits,  the  necessary  gain  values  were  achieved  by  increasing  the  ion 
concentration  in  the  silica  host  to  a  value  of  1031  ions/cm3.  At  this  concentration,  the 
pump powers relative to the threshold value for population inversion of the doped silica 
were within reasonable limits, i.e., a few times the threshold value. The pump power was 
varied to achieve different gain values with the ratio of pump power to threshold power, 
P, ranging from 0<P<5. The absorption and scattering cross-sections were then calculated 
as P was varied.  Figures 18 and 19, show the absorption and scattering efficiencies for 
both cases of gold and silver CNPs with rare earth doped silica cores.

From Figure 18, one observes that the absorption efficiency remains positive and 
no significant loss compensation is achieved when the gold shell is used, even at P values 
of 100. However, if a silver shell is used, one finds that the losses can be overcome for 
the same gain medium parameters, i.e., the lasing condition can be met, so that the super 
resonance  is  observed  when  P  =4.6.  Figure  20  shows  the  net  power  leaving  the  active 
CNP at the peak of the resonance when the values of P are varied. As was observed using 
the  canonical  gain  model,  it  is  clear  that  the  rare-earth  model  shows  a  similar  on/off 
feature of the lasing and the super resonance state.

Ag-SiO2 CNP with the rare-earth core. 

 
The stored energy plots for the rare-earth core CNP are shown in Figure 21. As in 
the canonical gain core case, the extremum in the total stored energy as a function of the 
power  parameter  coincides  with  the  maximally  negative  value  of  the  absorption 
efficiency when the super resonance values is attained.

Due  to  anomalous  dispersion  in  the  rare  earth  gain  model  used  in  the  core  region  the 
stored energy attains negative values passing through zero at the inflection point at P=1.6, 
energies are positive for P>1.6. 

Field plots for the rare-earth core CNP are shown in Figures 22 and 23. Again the 
radiation is dominated by the dipole field and the highest fields are located at the surface 
of the CNP and within the core region with low field values occurring in the silver shell.

V. Discussion  
 

The parameter space plots for the canonical gain model suggest that when gain is 
added  to  the  core  of  a  plasmonic  CNP,  its  losses  can  be  overcome.  In  addition  to  the 
enhancements of the scattering and absorption cross-sections associated with the plasmon 
modes of the passive CNP, there are values of the permittivity of the core for which light 
amplification  is  possible.    Furthermore,  there  are  core  permittivity  values  where 
phenomena indicative of lasing ensue. Within the quasi-static regime the sub-wavelength 
,  is  well  below  the  classical 
dimension  of  these  nano-shells,

/ 2λ   for  a  laser  resonator.    This  behavior  occurs  because  of  the 

In classical laser operation the smallest cavity dimension defining the longitudinal 
laser modes is 
/ 2λ . As the pump power is increased past the threshold value needed for 
inverting  the  gain  medium  and  overcoming  the  system  losses  in  a  classical  laser  below 
gain saturation, the laser output power increases monotonically. This behavior is due to 
the coherent oscillations of the resonant optical field in the laser cavity being amplified 
by the gain media. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the level of optical gain 
and  the  output  optical  power,  but  the  feedback  mechanism  has  no  dependence  on  the 
optical  gain  inside  the  laser  cavity.    On  the  other  hand,  the  coupled  photon-plasmon 
polariton modes of the shell-core system in the CNP are in resonance. Therefore, if we 
consider  the  plasmon  modes  as  providing  a  means  for  feedback  for  stimulated  photons 
within  the  active  core,  the  effects  of  the  coherent  oscillations  of  the  electrons  in  the 

 

28

plasmonic shell on the core and shell permittivities must be considered. This implies that 
in an active CNP, an increase of the optical gain in the core does not necessarily lead to 
efficient  coupling  between  the  stimulated  emission  photons  and  the  plasmon  modes. 
Therefore as the gain is increased, the strength of the emission resonance may change.  In 
particular,  it  may  turn  off  the  lasing  state.    To  clarify  this  behavior,  we  considered  a 
virtual mode analysis of the CNP. 

In the presence of anharmonic material functions, the plasmon modes of the CNP 
system can be regarded as virtual modes with frequencies that in general take on values 
over  the  right  half  of  the  complex  plane.  With  the  interpretation  that  the  imaginary 
frequencies  associated  with  these  virtual  modes  represent  temporally  growing  or 
decaying states of the CNP, there is a connection between the material functions in the 
shell and core and the allowed virtual modes of the passive or active CNP.  These virtual 
modes are excited in the absorption dominated passive CNP or the emission dominated 
active  CNP.  In  isolating  the  mechanism  responsible  for  the  on/off  nature  of  the  super 
resonant  lasing  state  in  the  CNP,  we  have  begun  investigating  the  influence  of  the 
material functions in the core and shell on the virtual modes of the CNP system in light of 
either  growing  or  decaying  modes  of  the  active  or  passive  CNP.    The  authors  hope  to 
explain the on/off nature of the super resonance lasing state of the active CNP from this 
perspective in a future publication.   
 
 
VI. Conclusions 
 
In  this  paper  we  have  presented  the  design  and  simulation  of  both  passive  and 
active plasmonic coated spherical nano-particles (CNP).  The sizes of these CNPs were 
selected  on  the  order  of  20-30  nm  to  make  them  applicable  to  realizing  optical 
metamaterials, as well as to investigate the possibility of realizing highly subwavelength 
resonant  optical  scatterers.  The  role  of  loss  in  the  passive  CNPs  due  to  the  optical 
properties of the plasmonic materials was considered, and the use of active materials in 
the  design  of  CNPs  was  investigated  to  compensate  this  loss  to  achieve  lossless  active 
CNP’s.  In  our  simulations  we  have  taken  into  consideration  the  size  dependence  of  the 
plasmonic  shells  and  have  used  both  canonical  gain  models,  as  well  as  gain  models 
representative of rare earth doped glass. From our investigations of active CNPs we have 
uncovered new phenomena that, aside from the geometric tunability of the passive CNPs, 
show  a  super  resonant  lasing  state.    In  this  super  resonant  state  the  CNP  achieves  a 
310  greater than the value obtained for a passive CNP, 
negative absorption efficiency of 
410 .  This increase in the total efficiency indicates the 
and a total efficiency of more than
/ 20λ . It was 
possible realization of a sub-wavelength laser whose size is on the order of
observed  in  the  parameter  space  of  the  core  and  shell  permittivities  that  there  exists  a 
well-defined  region  where  the  super  resonance  exists.  Furthermore,  the  super  resonant 
lasing state of the active CNP is observed to be localized in the gain parameter space in 
the  sense  that  it  can  be  turned  on  or  off  by  adding  gain  values  outside  of  the  region  in 
which the super resonance exists.  This behavior must be contrasted with a classical laser 
where lasing is maintained as the gain is increased past its threshold value. It is believed 
that  the  lasing  turns-off  when  the  gain  increases  to  such  a  point  that  it  causes  a  severe 
detuning of the structural resonance. To explain the on/off nature of the super resonance,

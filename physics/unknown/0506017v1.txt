In  order  to  clarify  why  the  zero-point  energy  associated  with  the  vacuum 
fluctuations cannot be a candidate for the dark energy in the universe, a comparison 
with  the  Casimir  effect  is  analyzed  in  some  detail.  A  principle  of  epistemology  is 
stressed  that  it  is  meaningless  to  talk  about  an  absolute  (isolated)  thing.  A  relative 
thing can only be observed when  it is changing with respect to other things. Then a 
new conjecture of antigravity  —  the repulsive force between matter and antimatter 
derived from the modified Einstein field equation in general relativity — is proposed. 
This  is  due  to  the  particle  –  antiparticle  symmetry  based  on  a  new  understanding 
about  the  essence  of  special  relativity.  Its  possible  consequences  in  the  theory  of 
cosmology  are  discussed  briefly,  including  a  new  explanation  for  the  accelerating 
universe and gamma-ray bursts.

INTRODUCTION 

The  past  decade  has  witnessed  a  remarkable  progress  of  cosmology  and 
astrophysics.  Especially,  the  precise  data  provided  by  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope 
(HST) key project, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) team, the 
Sloan  Digital  Sky  Survey  (SDSS) and the discovery of acceleration of the universe 
expansion, etc. have shaped an observable universe quite quantitatively. The present 
understanding can be summarized basically as follows (see, e.g. [1], [2]):

its distance D from earth

speculated before.

the space with their ratio being about 1: 6. The dark matter is still at large. 

(d)  The  temperature  fluctuations  of  cosmic  microwave  background  radiation

In other words, its “equation of state” can be written as

III.  DARK ENERGY VERSUS CASIMIR EFFECT 

The  biggest  mystery  of  dark  energy  lies  in  its  strange  property  of  negative 
pressure  which  implies  some  “antigravity”  and  leads  to  accelerating  expansion  of 
universe.  More  generally,  the  negative  pressure  is  characterized  by  an  equation  of 
state (10) with the parameter w <  -1/2 [6]. The model of cosmological constant (with 
w = -1) means the dark energy is uniform in space and constant in time. 

Alternatively, the “quintessence” model with w>  -1 means that the dark energy 
could be described by some dynamical scalar field which may vary with space and 
decay with time. Other models with w < -1 might be the sign of really exotic physics 
or some modification of GR. However, up to now, the data analyses still favor the 
simplest case of w = -1. 

On the other hand, a number of physicists doubt that there is something wrong 
in the concept of dark energy (see, e.g. [7]). Moreover, some new theories are put 
forward , e.g. [8], trying to substitute the dark energy. 

In  this  paper we wish to argue that the ZPEVF cannot be a candidate for dark 
energy. It was said that some experiment like the Casimir effect can be performed in 
laboratories,  providing  some  evidence  of  ZPEVF  to  explain  the  dark  energy.  We 
don’t think so. Let us have a look at the Casimir effect. 

As is well known, the Casimir force

Note  that:  (a)  The  wave  vectors  parallel  to  plates,

^k , are 
(presence  and  absence  of  plates);  (b)  The  wave  numbers  vertical  to  plates, 
discrete  (with  n  being  discrete  integer  numbers  )  in  the  presence  of  plates  whereas 
continuous (with n varying continuously) in the absence of plates; (c) For each fixed 
wave number, there are two modes of transversal polarization of field except for the 
case of 
^k =  0  (n  =  0)  where  only  one  mode  (vertical  to  plates)  exists.  (d)  The 
expression (19) is finite as shown by (18) and verified by experiments, see, e.g., [11]. 
Eq.(19) can be calculated either by introducing some cutoff function (e.g.[9]) or 
by resorting to a rigorous mathematical theorem — the Plana summation fo rmula  — 
as discussed in [12] (see also [10]). The reason why the theoretical result is free from 
any ambiguity is because 
cE ,  being  a  difference,  has  neither  ultraviolet  divergence 
(when k (cid:224) ¥
) nor infrared diverge nce (when k (cid:224) 0). In fact, the tiny contribution 
to cE is just coming from the difference of a sum and an integral with each of them 
being finite at k(cid:224)0 region. 

By  contrast,  aiming  at  an  explanation  for  dark  energy,  the  expression  for  the 
density  of  ZPEVF,  Eq.(14),  was  written  down  in  an  ambiguous  manner  from  the 
beginning  .  It  is  divergent  at  k(cid:224) ¥
limit. So, as a next step, an arbitrary cutoff was 
chosen to be the Planck energy (~ 

GeV). 
Third,  actually,  no  one  knows  exactly  how  many  varieties  of  different  fields

Fourth, no one really understands why this positive 

vacr  would lead to negative

pressure of dark energy?  

Fifth, no one can concretely explain how this negative (but isotropic) pressure 

exerts an outward repulsive force on a supernova to render it accelerating?  

Last,  but  not  least,  why  the  theoretical  estimation  of 

vacr  differs  from  that  of 

observation so absurd as shown by (17)?  

Physics is an accurate science as shown by the Casimir effect. The whole history 
of  physics  has  been  proving  that  a  correct  theory  should  be  able  to  account  for  the 
experiments quantitatively. Once there is certain but small discrepancy between them, 
it  must  imply  something  of  less  importance  being  ignored  in  the  theory.  If  the 
discrepancy  turns  to  be  large  in  quantity  or  even  out  of  control,  it  means  that 
something of importance must be wrong. Now we should regard Eq.(17) as a serious 
warning that we have been wrong in a fundamental way.

The reason why the evaluation for Casimir effect is correct whereas that for dark 
energy, Eq.(14), is wrong lies in the following clue: In the later case we were talking 
about  an  absolute  energy  of  the  cosmos  space  without  a  comparison  between  two 
configurations (as that in the Casimir effect). Thanks to researches on the dark energy 
over  decade,  we  now  have  a  very  strong  argument  supporting  the  principle  of 
relativity  in  physics  (also  in  epistemology,  see  [13]) — No change, no information. 
Any information (e.g., the energy, the momentum or the position of a particle, etc) is 
created  right  at  the  occurrence  of  a  changing  process,  i.e.,  at  the  measurement 
performed by the observer on the object. 

In fact, numerous experiments, especially that aiming at clarifying the Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen  paradox,  all  lead  to  the  same  conclusion  that  the  concrete  form  of 
correlation in a quantum state exhibits itself as a direct consequence of measurement 
right  at  the  destruction  of  original  entanglement  of  state  —  there  is  no  information 
existing before and after the measurement (for detail, see [10]). 

Maybe  many  physicists  still  not  believe  in  this  principle  mentioned  above.  Let 
us think about a simplest example: A particle with mass m is resting in the laboratory 
(S  frame).  I  can  say  that  it  has  no  kinetic  energy  as  long  as  I  am  staying  in  the  S 
frame too. However, once I jump onto a train (S’ frame) moving with a velocity v 

with  respect  to  S,  I  will  say  that  the  particle  has  a  kinetic  energy 

E =
  

2

mv

. The 

1
2

question  is:  Neither  I  nor  anybody  had  done  any  work  on  the  particle.  Where  its 
energy  is  coming  from?  This  simple  example  shows  that  it  is  meaningless  to  talk 
about the absolute energy of an isolated object. Only when two particles are colliding 
each  other,  can  the  energy  (and  momentum)  transfer  be  unambiguously  calculated 
either in S or in S’ frame. The energy (momentum) conservation law is meaningful 
exactly only right at the occurrence of collision, not before or after. Moreove r, in fact, 
the definitions of energy and momentum are precisely meaningful only when they are 
conserved. 

There is another problem in the theory of ZPEVF as dark energy — the theory of 
GR  had  been  mixed  with  the  QFT.  We  will  discuss  it  after  we  further  clarify the 
classical nature of GR in the next section. 

IV.  ANTIMATTER  AND  A  NEW  MODEL  FOR  UNIVERSE 
EXPANSION 

We wish to propose an alternative explanation for the accelerating universe, i.e., 
antigravity without invoking the dark energy. In our opinion, we should start from 
scratch. After studying the theory of special relativity (SR) for decades, we have been 
learning  the  essence  of  SR  being  nothing  but  the  equal  existence  of  particle  and 
antiparticle [14, 15, 10, 13]. Many physicists thought that the so-called CP violation 
in  weak  interactions  might  trigger  (in  an  early  epoch  of  universe  expansion)  the 
asymmetry of particles and antiparticles — the former surpass the latter in number up 
to a factor like 
. We don’t think so. The CP inve rsion is equivalent to the so-
called  “time  reversal”,  but  the  latter  is  essentially  not  a  “time  reversal”  (which  is 
merely  a  misnomer)  but  a  “motion  reversal”  (see  [16],  [10]).  Hence  the  tiny  CP 

8 10 - 10

5 

violation  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  symmetry  between  particle  and  antiparticle. 
Rather, we believe that in the entire universe, the number of particles is equal to that 
of antiparticles. 

Next,  thanks  again  to  SR  combining  with  quantum  mechanics  (QM)  and 
evolving to relativistic QM (RQM), we notice that there is a mass inversion ( m  (cid:224)- 
m  )  symmetry  in  RQM  to  reflect  the  particle  –  antiparticle  symmetry  [17].  This 
symmetry, together with an interesting discussion of  “negative mass paradox” raised 
in [18], leads to a natural generalization of Newton’s gravitation law [17]:

Here the minus (plus) sign means the attractive (repulsive) force between matters or 
antimatters  (matter  and  antimatter).  Note  that  the  mass  of  matter  or  antimatter  is 
always  positive.  Eq.(20)  can  be  deduced  from  the Einstein field equation in GR by 
modifying its right-hand side as [17]:

In ref [17], some further conjectures are proposed as follows: 
(a)  The  big  bang  created  equal  quantities  of  particles  and  antiparticles.  The 
repulsive  force  between  them  triggered the inflationary expansion. But antiparticles 
had  a  head  start  and  flew  away  faster  than  particles  did.  The  latter  lagged  behind  to 
some  extent  and  our  galaxies  gradually  evolved  out  of  them.  On  the  other  hand, 
distant stellar objects might be evolved  from antiparticles and some of them may be 
just those observed supernovae undergoing acceleration caused by the repulsive force 
exerted by inner galaxies composed mainly of matters. 

(b)  The flatness of our universe is critically depending on two factors: first, the 
inflationary expansion; second, the nearly equal densities of matter and antimatter in 
a large part of universe after the inflationary expansion. (See Appendix and Fig.1). 

(c)  In the intermediate region where matter and antimatter are overlapping, there 
may be some probability of collisions between matter and antimatter. Because of the 
long range repulsive force between them, these collisions may be of grazing type and 
so  the  annihilation  process  occurs  at  short  distance  would  have  some  special 
characte r. Maybe it could explain the mechanism of gamma-ray- bursts (GRBs), the 
latter are distributed at remote distance on a cosmological scale and they tend to have 
a roughly constant explosive energy (especially for GRBs with typical lifetime T ~ 
20s. Most likely, the gamma rays are emitted within two small-angle jets). 

(d)  Furthermore, it is observed that the star formation rate is rising steadily from 
remote  distance  with  redshift  z  ~2  to  z  >  6  [19].  We  guess  this  phenomenon  is  a 
reflection  that  the  domination  of  antimatters  is  increasing  steadily  there.  Since  the 
coexistence  of  matter  and  antimatter  would  suppress  the  fluctuations  inside  the 
mixture  of  them  and  thus  suppress  the  formation  of  stars,  we  guess  there  might  be

Fig.1  shows  a  schematic  diagram  of  universe  expansion.  It  is  a  separating 
process  of  matter  from  antimatter  with  (the  cosmological)  time.  Hence  their 
overlapping  region  decreases  gradually  and  its  two  boundaries can be estimated via 
the  measurements  on  the  farthest  and  nearest  GRBs  (located  at
) 
respectively. Our Earth is located near the center of matter region because: (a). The 
distribution  of  GRBs  is  isotropic  in  all  directions.  (b).  The  CMB  has  a  bipolar 
anisotropy showing the velocity of Earth being only V = 365 km/s with respect to the 
“cosmos rest frame” (CRF), whose origin should be the point surrounded by CMB 
y.

Indeed, if resorting to the Hubble law, Eq.(1), and substituting the value of V = 365 
km/s into the z = V/c , a distance of  Earth from the origin of CRF can be estimated to 
be 5 Mpc which accounts only 0.2% of the length scale of matter region ( estimated 
to be 2000 Mpc at z =0.5). (c). Lucky enough, this location of Earth ensures a safer 
environment  for  human  being’s  evolution.  Other  places  in  the  universe  would  be 
suffered from more dangerous radiations emitted by nearer GRBs in the past billion 
years.

V.  SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION  

(a) The essence of SR or that of the principle of relativity has two linked aspects, 
one in physics and one in epistemology [13]. The former is used to establish Eqs. (20) 
and  (21)  while  the latter forms the main crux of our argument of why the ZPEVF 
cannot be the dark energy. 

(b) The  physical  essence  of  SR  is  nothing  but  the  symmetry  of  particle  and 
antiparticle, which can be stated in one of two equivalent invariance, the invariance 
under the newly defined space-time inversion (x(cid:224) -x, t (cid:224) -t) at QM level [10] or that 
under the mass inversion (m  (cid:224) -m). The latter can be used either at QM level or at 
classical level. Being a classical field theory and treating only the gravitation among 
matters,  the  GR  should  be  and  can  be  modified  to  incorporate  antimatter  so  that  a 
new approach of big bang theory of cosmology might be established from scratch, 
treating matter and antimatter on an equal footing. However, even the modification 
shown in (21) has  been made, it clearly refuses the addition of a quantum average of 
ZPEVF  (even  if  it  is  considered  ambiguously)  to  the  classical  energy  momentum 
tensor because the contribution from matter will cancel that (if considered separately) 
from antimatter ( becau se both of them should have the same sign), a conclusion just 
in contradiction with the prediction of Eq.(14) by QFT (where the ZPEVF of particle 
and  antiparticle  is  considered  as  a  whole).  So  we  see  that  the  discussion  of  (11) 
through  (17)  is  merely  confusion  in  concept  to  combine  a  classical  theory  with 
quantum theory incorrectly. We still have no correct QFT for gravitation yet. 

(c) Every  law  in  physics  is  a  discovery  about  the  objective  nature,  also  an 
innovation of human being as the subject. An isolated thing is absolute or abstract in 
the  sense  of  being  devoid  of  any  cognition.  We  can  only  construct  a  meaningful 
theory based on (at least) two opposite things. Usually, in an experiment, one of them

is just the apparatus. However, in QM, in order to describe an abstract quantum state 
vector  y   of  a  particle  concretely,  one  has  to  resort  to  a  basis  vector 
 (which 
represents a “fictitious apparatus”, see [10, 13]) for obtaining the wave function: 
=tx
 ),(
  

(22) 
which is nothing but a probability amplitude of “fictitious measurement” to detect the 
“potential  possibility”  of  finding  the  particle  at  position  x  and  time  t.  The  wave 
function is really a great innovation to endow the QM a prediction power before the 
real  measurement  is  made.  Another  example  is  the  Casimir  effect.  The  existence  of 
two plates allows us to compare the ZPEVF in two configurations (the presence and 
absence  of  two  plates).  In  this  case,  every  thing  is  finite  and  can  be  calculated 
unambiguously.  By  the  way,  all  contributions  of  ZPEVF  of  massive  particles  to 
Casimir effect can be ignored.

(d)  The  divergence,  i.e.,  the  emergence  of  infinity  has  two  aspects  in 
mathematics: (1) it is a huge number; (2) it is uncertain. However, we physic ists often 
emphasized  the  first  one  whereas  overlooked  the  second  one.  We  often  introduced 
some  cutoff  to  render  the  divergence  under  control  like  equation  (15).  Thus  we 
overlooked  the  uncertainty  in  mathematics  implying  a  warning  in  physics  —  it 
implies that we expected too much in trying to calculate something beyond our ability, 
or most likely, that thing doesn’t exist at all. In short, we were wrong in some basic 
way. 

(e)  For  example,  in  QFT,  the  divergence  emerges  every  where.  The  situation 

was put by Dirac in the following words: (see [20]) 

“It  would  seem  that  we  have  followed  as  far  as  possible  the  path  of  logical 
development of the idea of QM as they are present understood. The difficulties, being 
of  a  profound  character,  can  be  removed  only  by  some  dra stic  change  in  the 
foundation  of  the  theory,  probably  a  change  as  drastic  as  the  passage  from  Bohr’s 
orbit theory to the present QM.”  

It seems to us that one important necessary change in basic concept is just the 
following answer to the famous Einstein’s question: “Is the moon there when nobody 
looks?”[21]  The  “reality’  should  be  defined  at  two  levels:  Originally,  every  thing 
contains  no  information  at  the  level  of  “thing-in-itself”  isolated  from  other  things. 
Then  it  turns  into  the  “thing-for-us”  during  (not  before  or  after)  a  certain 
measurement by us, reflecting a series of observed phenomena. Every thing is infinite 
whereas our experimental data and theoretical interpretations must be fixed and finite 
before they can be meaningful. We had expected too much in QFT and been bothered 
by divergences for decades. Eventually, we got rid of them just because we began to 
distinguish  what  is  existent  thing  whereas  what  is  not.  And  we  began  to  understand 
that we may get more only after we expect less. (See [13, 22, 23].) 

(f) The  particle -antiparticle  symmetry  prevails  throughout  the  entire  universe  but  it  is 
spontaneously broken into two regions. We are living in the particle region and, very likely, near its 
center. 

(g) Nowadays,  one  of  the  most  important  frontiers  of  physics  lies  in  the  fast 
developing  field  of  cosmology  and  astrophysics.  Among  the  greatest  unsolved 
problems in science [24], the mystery of dark energy occupies a prominent position.

We  are  lucky  to  encounter  a  divergence  like  Eq.(14)  once  again  which  unveils  a 
discrepancy between theory and observation as in (17) that is unprecedentedly huge. 
This should be regarded as a new, serious warning from Mother Nature. It’s time for 
us to listen to her.

APPENDIX.  ACCELERATING  UNIVERSE  EXPLAINED  BY 
MODIFIED EINSTEIN FIELD EQUATION 

If  similar  to  the  Friedmann  model  [3],  now  the  Einstein  field  equation  ((6) 
 term)  with  modification  (21)  is  tentatively  solved  for  the  time  (the 
without  the  L
cosmological time coordinate) evolution of a dimensionless cosmological scale factor 
R(t)  in  the  Robertson-  Walker  metric.  Being  a  measure  of  the  deviation  from  the 
 could  be 
Hubble  law,  the  time  derivative  of  Hubble  parameter 
derived approximately as (c =1):

are the mass density and pressure of matter (antimatter) in the 
flat cosmos with zero curvature. However, because an timatter flew away faster than 
matter,  depending  on  the  initial  condition  at  the  end  of  inflationary  expansion  era, 
there  should  be  two  co-moving  coordinate  systems  related  to  them  separately.  This 
complication renders Eq. (A.1) and the following three possibilities only meaningful 
qualitatively: 

(a) In the matter dominant region nearer to our galaxy, 

cr ~

< 0, the 

universe expansion is decelerating. 

(b)  In  the  intermediate  region  of  universe  where  matter  and  antimatter  are 
~ 0, the linear relation 
overlapping  with  nearly  equal  densities,  r ~ cr , 
of Hubble law remains valid and shows a coasting cosmos that is neither accelerating 
nor decelerating.

(c)  In  the  outer  region  of  universe  where  the  antimatter  dominates,  r ~  p  ~ 
 >0, the universe expansion began to accelerate as shown by the supernovae

(with z > 0.5) observed after 1998. 

Of  course,  a  more  rigorous  treatment  is  needed.  But  it  seems  likely  that  the 
cosmological  constant  (dark  energy)  is  merely  a  false  appearance  of  antimatter 
distributed at the remote distance.

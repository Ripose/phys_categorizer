ABSTRACT
In  a  previous  work  it  was  shown  that  the  gravitational  and  inertial  masses  are  correlated  by    an
adimensional factor, which depends on the incident radiation upon the particle. It was also shown  that
there is a direct correlation between the radiation absorbed by the particle and its gravitational mass,
independently  of  the  inertial  mass.  This  finding  has  fundamental  consequences  to  Unified  Field
Theory  and  Quantum  Cosmology.  Only  in  the  absence  of  electromagnetic  radiation  the  mentioned
factor  becomes  equal  to  one.  On  the  other  hand,  in  specific  electromagnetic  conditions,  it  can  be
reduced,    nullified    or  made      negative.  This  means  that  there  is  the  possibility  of  the  gravitational
masses  can  be  reduced,  nullified  and  made  negative  by  means  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  This
unexpected  theoretical  result    was  recently  confirmed    by    an  experiment    (gr-qc/0005107).  A
fundamental  consequence  of  the  mentioned  correlation  is  that  ,  in  specific  ultra-high  energy
conditions, the gravitational  and  electromagnetic fields can be described by the same Hamiltonian ,
i.e.,  in  these  circumstances,  they  are  unified  !  Such  conditions    can  have  occurred  inclusive  in  the
Initial  Universe  , before the first  spontaneous  breaking  of  symmetry.  Taking  as  base  this  discovery,
and starting from the gravitational mass of  superparticles from the Initial Universe we show here that
it  is  possible  to  deduce  the  reciprocal  fine  structure  constant  and  the  uncertainty  principle  directly
from the Gravitation Theory(Unified  Theory).

INTRODUCTION

        In a recent paper1 we have shown
that  the  gravitational  mass  and  the
inertial  mass  are  correlated  by  an
adimensional    factor,  which  depends
on  the  incident  radiation  upon  the
particle.  It  was  shown  that  only  in  the
absence  of  electromagnetic  radiation
this  factor  becomes  equal  to  1  and
that, 
electromagnetic
conditions, it can be reduced,  nullified
or made   negative.
        The

        In  the  GUTs,  the    Initial  Universe
was  simplified  for  just  two  types  of
fundamental  particles:  the  boson  and
the  fermion.  However,  bosons  and
fermions  are  unified  in  Supergravity:
One can be transformed into another ,
just as quarks can be transformed into
leptons  in  the  GUTs.  Thus,  in  the

In  the  case of thermal radiation,  it  is
usual    to    relate    the    energy    of
photons  to  temperature,  through   the
relation,                <hn >~  kT          where
k=1.38  · 10-23J/K    is  the  Boltzmann’s
constant. Thus, in this case, the energy
the  particle  will  be
absorbed  by 
U=h <hn >~h kT, 
h  
is  a  particle-
dependent  absorption  coefficient  (in
for  elementary  particles,
general, 
h ~ 0.1).
        The 
the
Universe in the 10-43s< t < 10-23s period
can  be  calculated  by  means  of  the
well-known expression2

This  means  that  in  the  period  where
gravitation and electromagnetism were
unified  (which  would  have  occurred
from    time  zero  up  to  a  critical  time
tc  @   10-43s      after  Big-Bang  )  the
temperature   was T >>1032K .

the  Hawking’s3
to 
        According 
prediction,  collapsed  objects  cannot
have  Schwarzchild’s  radius less than
length.  This
the  particle’s  wave 
correspond to  inertial mass mi~10-8kg.
On 
the  highest
temperature  T  >>1032K    indicates  that
h kT/c2>>10-8kg. Thus, we can assume
that  U  =  h kT>>mspc2.  (msp    is  the
superparticle’s inertial mass.).

the  other  hand,

        For  U=h kT>>mspc2  the  equation
(2) reduces to:

    mg@

- 2U/c2 =- 2h kT/c2>>10-8kg     (3)

which  is  the  gravitational  mass  of  the
superparticles.

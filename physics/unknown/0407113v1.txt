Abstract  
 
Shematovich et al. (2003) recently showed plasma induced sputtering in Titan’s atmosphere is a 

source of neutral nitrogen in Saturn’s magnetosphere comparable to the photo-dissociation source. 
These sources form a toroidal nitrogen cloud roughly centered at Titan’s orbital radius but 
gravitationally bound to Saturn. Once ionized, these particles contribute to Saturn’s plasma. When 
Titan is inside Saturn’s magnetopause, newly formed ions can diffuse inward becoming inner 
magnetospheric energetic nitrogen where they can sputter and be implanted into icy satellite surfaces. 
Our 3-D simulation produces the first consistent Titan generated N and N2 neutral clouds; solar UV 
radiation and magnetospheric plasma subject these particles to dissociation and ionization. The cloud 
morphologies and associated nitrogen plasma source rates are predicted in anticipation of Cassini data. 
Since the amount of molecular nitrogen ejected from Titan by photo-dissociation is small, molecular 
nitrogen ions detection by Cassini will be an indicator of atmospheric sputtering. 

 
 
1. Introduction 
Beyond Saturn’s five inner icy satellites lies Titan, its largest satellite. Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 & 2, 
Earth based observations and more recently, Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations contributed 
much of our limited knowledge about the magnetosphere between Saturn and Titan. In the vicinity of 
the icy satellites, neutral atoms and molecules dominate the magnetosphere with only about 10% of 
these particles present as ions (Richardson 1998). However, we know little about the magnetosphere 
composition at Titan’s orbit. Because Saturn’s magnetic field rotates on an axis approximately aligned 
with planetary rotation, the thermal plasma efficiently interacts with the neutrals at average relative 
velocities varying with distance from the planet. Since Titan lacks a magnetic field, these plasma 
particles can also penetrate its dense N2 atmosphere and eject neutrals into the magnetosphere, a 
process often referred to as atmospheric sputtering (Johnson 1994). Initial estimates from Voyager 
observations placed the Titan generated N source rate at 3 x 1026 N/s (Strobel and Shemansky 1982). 
Later, Strobel et al (1992) estimated that electron impact and photo-dissociation produced less than or 
equal to 1025 N/s. Using a 1-D Monte Carlo simulation and the pick-up ions flux from Brecht et al. 
(2000), Shematovich et. al. (2003) calculated an atmospheric sputtering source rate at approximately 4 
x 1025 N/s, which is comparable to the photo- and electron impact dissociation source. Michael et al 
(2004) using a 3-D Monte Carlo model with improved cross sections obtained a slightly higher loss 
rate. In spite of the considerable uncertainties in these calculations, it is possible to conclude Titan 
provides a significant source of both atomic and molecular nitrogen forming a neutral torus in Saturn’s 
magnetosphere. Electron impact, charge exchange and UV photons subsequently ionize these neutrals. 
Some of these ions diffuse inward toward Saturn providing a hot nitrogen source for implantation into 
the surfaces of the icy satellites (Sittler et al. 2004). Therefore, Cassini’s plasma instruments will also 
search for nitrogen containing molecules ejected from the icy satellites surfaces.  

 
We describe here a 3-D Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the density of the N and N2 neutral 
clouds. We optimized the model to provide efficient execution over many years. Principal outputs are 
the neutral N and N2 cloud topography and the spatial distribution of the freshly produced atomic and 
molecular nitrogen ions. The UV instrument and the energetic neutral imaging on Cassini might detect 
these neutrals and the Cassini Plasma Science instrument (CAPS) will directly detect freshly ionized 
nitrogen. Our model can readily accommodate new data as it becomes available. Although the model 

does not assume azimuthal symmetry, until Cassini plasma data is available we will use azimuthally 
symmetric ionization rates. 

 
 
2. Model Description 
 
Titan loses atmosphere through Jeans’ escape; photo- and electron-impact dissociation; ionization 

and sweeping, and atmospheric sputtering. Whereas ionization and sweeping is a direct source of 
molecular ions for Saturn’s magnetosphere, the other processes produce neutrals. Jean’s escape 
primarily yields molecular hydrogen, dissociation produces atomic N and H, and atmospheric 
sputtering produces atomic and molecular neutrals, primarily N and N2. Here we model the neutral 
nitrogen atoms and molecules ejected from Titan. 

 
Our model has two main components. The “satellite model” replicates the environment close to 
Titan and the “Saturn model” reproduces the torus around Saturn. The satellite model produces high-
resolution results within the Hill sphere and provides input to the “Saturn model”, which generates 
particle densities for the entire neutral cloud. This separation will allow us to make the best use of the 
expected Cassini data at Titan and in the torus. We designed the model for rapid execution over 
relatively large time periods and we account for neutrals reabsorbed by Titan. 

 
The simulations are initiated using nitrogen source fluxes from Titan (Michael et. al., 2004; 
Shematovich et al., 2003), ejected by ion and photon bombardment of its upper atmosphere. These 
fluxes also account for re-impact of pick-up ions. In the satellite model, N and N2 are ejected in a Titan 
centered inertial reference frame. Although the model is 3-D, we use isotropic ejection from Titan until 
the plasma flow onto the exobase is better defined. We compare these to results using the standard 
atmospheric sputtering distribution (Johnson 1994):

where U is the escape energy from Titan’s exobase (~0.3 eV for N and ~0.6 eV for N2).  
 
We characterize the nitrogen atoms and molecules escaping from Titan using the N and N2 energy 

spectra in Fig.1 in combination with the source rates in Table 1. Michael et al. (2004) generated the 
+, 
pick-up ion source using energetic N2
H2CN+, HCN+, etc.). We used the photon-induced source from Shematovich et al. (2003). The model 
ejects N and N2 particles from Titan’s exobase and propagates their trajectories until they exceed 
Titan’s Hill Sphere. At this point the satellite model transfers particles to the Saturn model. These 
particle trajectories are then propagated within the Saturn model until they impact Saturn, a satellite or 
the main rings, escape from Saturn or become ionized.

3. Results 
 

Particle lifetimes and the initial energy distribution of particles escaping from Titan primarily 
determine neutral cloud densities. We used the same set of photo and electron impact cross sections 
used in Shematovich et. al. (2003) and charge exchange cross-sections are from our database 
(http://www.people.virginia.edu/rej/cross_section). We then applied these cross sections to two radial 
distributions of the plasma in Saturn’s magnetosphere. The solid lines shown in Figs. 2a and 2b apply 
when Titan lies within Saturn’s magnetosphere, representing lifetimes derived from Richardson and 
Sittler (1990) and Voyager data. Fig. 2a also shows the average lifetime used by Barbosa (1987) at 
Titan’s orbit. When we conservatively extrapolated the lifetimes beyond 14 Rs, where Rs is the radius 
of Saturn, then photon-induced lifetimes dominate at Titan’s orbit (as shown by the dotted lines in 
Figs. 2a and 2b). This gives an approximate lower bound to the ionization and dissociation rates and 
can roughly represent periods when Titan is outside of the magnetosphere. 

 
Fig. 3 shows the N and N2 densities based on the solid line lifetimes in Figs. 2a & 2b and the 
energy distributions in Fig. 1. The N cloud includes dissociated N2 products as well as directly ejected 
N. This combination of short lifetimes and energetic nitrogen results in the lowest densities. 
Approximately 67% of the N and 47% of the N2 escape beyond 50 Saturn radii and, therefore, do not 
contribute significantly to the nitrogen cloud’s morphology. In addition, Titan reabsorbs a few percent.   

 
To examine the initial energy’s effect on cloud density distribution, we also used the standard 
energy distribution in Fig. 1 and the longer lifetimes (dotted lines) in Figs. 2a and 2b to create a rough 
upper bound to the nitrogen densities. Fig. 4 shows the resulting neutral cloud densities. These are 
noticeably increased as only 38% of the N and 34% of the N2 escape beyond 50 Saturn radii.  

 
These simulations give a neutral cloud with a significantly different morphology from the simple 
model of Barbosa (1987). Barbosa’s estimated cloud extends inward to 8 Saturn Radii (Rs) while ours 
extends several Rs closer to Saturn and his cloud thickness is 8-16 Rs while ours is much less than 8 
Rs. Additionally, Barbosa estimates an average nitrogen density of 6/cm3, but our average density is 
lower. Although he assumed a much larger vertical scale, his assumed source rate is over an order of 
magnitude larger, leading to higher densities. Ip (1992) also predicted higher densities (3-20 /cm3) near 
Titan. He also assumed an order of magnitude higher source rate. In both of the simulations presented 
here, the nitrogen clouds extend inward towards Saturn and, therefore, are a source of fresh nitrogen 
ions in inner magnetosphere as well as in the outer magnetosphere. Fig.5 gives the source rate of fresh 
atomic and molecular nitrogen ions for the clouds in Fig. 3. Nitrogen is ionized faster in the inner 
magnetosphere so in this model the N+ source rate peaks in this region despite the smaller neutral 
particle density.  

 
Finally, our results show in the vicinity of Titan’s orbital radius, the neutral nitrogen density is 
larger than the Voyager-based ion density as is the case in the inner magnetosphere (Richardson et al. 
1998). However, both the nitrogen ion densities and our model for the neutrals are based on a number 
of assumptions and extrapolations which we will update as Cassini data becomes available. 

 
 
4. Conclusions 

 

In this paper we calculated the neutral tori at Saturn generated by N and N2 escaping from Titan. 
The cloud density and morphology, and the spatial distribution of the nitrogen ions produced are given 

in anticipation of Cassini. These results can be scaled, as better Titan source rates are determined. The 
tori are centered on Titan and extend into the inner magnetosphere, with most of the density remaining 
close to the orbital plane. Our initial results indicate that neutral nitrogen may dominate the nitrogen 
ion population near Titan’s orbital radius. The initial nitrogen energy distribution noticeably affects the 
cloud morphology and density. Relatively small increases in this energy distribution can cause many 
more particles to escape from Saturn since Titan is more than 20 Rs from Saturn in a region of 
relatively weak gravitational attraction. At this distance, the total escape energy from Saturn is only 4.3 
eV for N and 8.6 eV for N2. Therefore, Cassini measurements of the morphology will help constrain 
models of the plasma interaction with Titan. 

 
Since Titan is not always within Saturn’s magnetopause, we used ionization and dissociation rates 
that roughly bracket the times when it is inside and outside the magnetosphere. However, care must be 
taken, because even when Titan lies outside of the magnetopause on the dayside, it will re-enter the 
magnetosphere before reaching the night side. Because each Titan orbit is approximately sixteen days 
but the lifetimes are such that steady state requires a number of years of simulation, one would need to 
average these cases for the fraction of the time spent outside of the magnetopause. When Cassini data 
is available, we will use 3-D ionization rates to generate a correct time-varying model that allows for 
azimuthal asymmetry and varies over the solar cycle. We have also given ion source rates for one case. 
It is seen, surprisingly, that there is a small secondary peak in the nitrogen ion formation rate at a 
smaller distance from Titan caused by centrifugal confinement and higher ionization rates in this 
region. These ions will have lower average energies than inwardly diffusing nitrogen ions. 

 
Although the H2 source rate is higher than either N or N2, the heavier nitrogen ions are of interest 
to us because of their potential impact on inner magnetospheric objects. The nitrogen ions that diffuse 
inward become energized and can be implanted in and sputter these moons (Sittler et al. 2004), 
ultimately driving nitrogen chemistry (Delitsky and Lane 2002). Because atmospheric sputtering is a 
+ 
significant source of N2 as well as N, but photo-dissociation is not, detection of freshly produced N2
ions in Titan’s torus by the Cassini plasma science instrument (CAPS) can determine the relative 
importance of atmospheric sputtering and the nature of the plasma/atmosphere interaction.

Abstract

  Ground based, wind energy extraction systems have reached their maximum capability. The 
limitations of current designs are: wind instability, high cost of installations, and small power output of 
a single unit. The wind energy industry needs of revolutionary ideas to increase the capabilities of wind 
installations. This article suggests a revolutionary innovation which produces a dramatic increase in 
power per unit and is independent of prevailing weather and at a lower cost per unit of energy 
extracted. The main innovation consists of large free-flying air rotors positioned at high altitude for 
power and air stream stability, and an energy cable transmission system between the air rotor and a 
ground based electric generator. The air rotor system flies at high altitude up to 14 km. A stability and 
control is provided and systems enable   the changing of altitude. 
  This article includes six examples having a high unit power output (up to 100 MW). The proposed 
examples provide the following main advantages: 1. Large power production capacity per unit – up to 
5,000-10,000 times more than conventional ground-based rotor designs; 2. The rotor operates at high 
altitude of 1-14 km, where the wind flow is strong and steady; 3. Installation cost per unit energy is 
low. 4. The installation is environmentally friendly (no propeller noise).

Introduction

    Wind  is a clean and inexhaustible source of energy that has been used for many centuries to grind 
grain, pump water, propel sailing ships, and perform other work. 
   Wind farm is the term used for a large number of wind machines clustered at a site with persistent 
favorable winds, generally near mountain passes. Wind farms have been erected in New Hampshire, in 
the  Tehachapi  Mountains.  at  Altamont  Pass  in  California,  at  various  sites  in  Hawaii,  and  may  other 
locations.  Machine  capacities  range  from  10  to  500  kilowatts.  In  1984  the  total  energy  output  of  all 
wind farms in the United States exceeded 150 million kilowatt-hours.
  A program of the United States Department of Energy encouraged the development of new machines, 
the  construction  of  wind  farms,  and  an  evaluation  of  the  economic  effect of  large-scale  use  of  wind 
power.
  The utilization of renewable energy (‘green’ energy) is currently on the increase. For example, a lot of 
wind turbines are being installed along the British coast. In addition, the British government has plans 
to develop off-shore wind farms along their coast in an attempt to increase the use of renewable energy 
sources. A total of $2.4 billion was injected into renewable energy projects over the last three years in 
an attempt to meet the government's target of using renewable energy to generate 10% of the country's 
energy needs by 2010. 
  This British program saves the emission of almost a millions tons of carbon dioxide. Denmark plans 
to get about 30% of their energy from wind sources.

 Unfortunately,  current  wind  energy  systems  have  deficiencies  which  limit  their  commercial 
applications:
1.  Wind energy is unevenly distributed and has relatively low energy density. Huge turbines cannot be 
placed on the ground, many small turbines must be used instead. In California, there are thousands 
of small wind turbines. However, while small turbines are relatively inefficient, very huge turbines 

3

placed at ground are also inefficient due to  the  relatively low wind energy density and their high 
cost. The current cost of wind energy is higher then energy of thermal power stations.
 Wind power is a function of the cube of wind velocity. At surface level, wind has low speed and it 
is non-steady. If wind velocity decreases in half, the wind power decreases by a factor of 8 times. 

2. 

3.  The productivity of a wind-power system depends heavily on the prevailing weather.
4.  Wind turbines produce noise and visually detract from the landscape.     
   There  are  many  research  programs  and  proposals  for  the  wind  driven  power  generation  systems, 
however,  all  of  them  are  ground  or  tower  based.  System  proposed  in  this  article  is  located  at  high 
altitude  (up  to  the  stratosphere),  where  strong  permanent  and  steady  streams  are  located.    The  also 
proposes  a  solution  to  the  main  technologist  challenge  of  this  system;  the  transfer  of  energy  to  the 
ground via a mechanical transmission made from closed loop, modern composite fiber cable.    
     The reader can find the information about this idea in [1], the wind energy in references [2]-[3], a 
detailed description of the innovation in [4]-[5], and new material used in the proposed innovation in 
[6]-[9]. The application of this innovation and energy transfer concept to other fields can be found in 
[10]-[19].

Description of Innovation

   Main  proposed  high  altitude  wind  system  is  presented  in  fig.1.  That  includes:  rotor  (turbine)  1, 
support wing 2, cable mechanical transmission and keep system 3, electro-generator 4, and stabilizer 5. 
The transmission system has three cables (fig.1e): main (central) cable, which keeps the rotor at a given 
altitude,  and  two  transmission  mobile  cables,  which  transfer  energy  from  the  rotor  to  the  ground 
electric  generator.  The  device  of  fig.1f  allows  changing  a  cable  length  and  a  rotor  altitude.  In  calm 
weather the rotor can be support at altitude by dirigible 9 (fig.1c) or that is turned in vertical position 
and support by rotation from the electric generator (fig.1d). If the wind is less of a minimum speed for 
support  of  rotor  at  altitude  the  rotor  may  be  supported  by  autogiro  mode  in  position  of  fig.1d.  The 
probability of full wind calm at a high altitude is small and depends from an installation location. 
   Fig.2 shows other design of the proposed high altitude wind installation.  This rotor has blades, 10, 
connected to closed-loop cables. The forward blades have a positive angle and lift force. When they are 
in a back position the lift force equals zero. The rotor is supported at the high altitude by the blades and 
the wing 2 and stabilizer 5. That design also has energy transmission 3 connected to the ground electric 
generator 4.
  Fig.3. shows a parachute wind high altitude installation. Here the blades are changed by parachutes. 
The parachutes have a large air drag and rotate the cable rotor 1. The wind 2 supports the installation in 
high altitude. The cable transmission 3 passes the rotor rotation to the ground electric generator 4.
  A system of fig.4 uses a large Darries air turbine located at high altitude. This turbine has four blades. 
The other components are same with previous projects. 
   Wind turbine of fig.5 is a wind ground installation. Its peculiarity is a gigantic cable-blade rotor. That 
has a large power for low ground wind speed. It has four columns with rollers and closed-loop cable 
rotor with blades 10. The wind moves the blades, the blades move the cable, and the cable rotates an 
electric generator 4.
Problems of launch, start, guidance, control, stability, and others
  Launching. It is not difficult to launch the installations having support wing or blades as described in 
fig.1-4. If the wind speed is more than the minimum required speed (>2-3 m/s), the support wing lifts 
the installation to the desired altitude.
  Starting.  All  low-speed  rotors  are  self-starting.  All  high-speed  rotors  (include  the  ground  rotor  of 
fig.5) require an initial starting rotation from the ground motor-generator 4 (figs.1,5).

 Guidance  and  Control.  The  control  of  power,  revolutions  per  minute,  and  torque  moment  are 
operated  by  the  turning  of  blades  around  the  blade  longitudinal  axis.  The  control  of  altitude  may  be 
manual or automatic when the wind speed is normal and over admissible minimum. Control is effected 
by wing flaps and stabilizer (elevator), fin, and ailerons (figs. 1,2,4).
  Stability.  Stability  of  altitude  is  produced  by  the  length  of  the  cable.  Stability  around  the  blade 
longitudinal axis is made by stabilizer (see figs.1,2,4). Rotor directional stability in line with the flow 

5
can be provided by fins (figs. 1). When the installation has the support wing rigidly connected to the 
rotor,  the  stability  is  also  attained  by  the  correct  location  of  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  installation 
(system  rotor-wing)  and  the  point  of  connection  of  the  main  cable  and  the  tension  elements.  The 
center-of-gravity and connection point must be located within a relatively narrow range 0.2-0.4 of the 
average  aerodynamic  chord  of  the  support  wing  (for  example,  see  fig.  1).  There  is  the  same 
requirement for the additional support wings such as fig.2-4.  
  Torque moment is balanced by transmission and wing ailerons (see figs.1-4).
  The  wing  lift  force,  stress  of  main  cable  are  all  regulated  automatic  by  the  wing  flap  or  blade 
stabilizer.
  The  location  of  the  installation  of  fig.2  at  a  given  point  in  the  atmosphere  may  be  provided  by 
tension  elements  shown  on  fig.2.  These  tension  elements  provide  a  turning  capability  for  the 
installation of approximately  450 degrees in the direction of flow (see. Fig.2.).
   Minimum  wind  speed.  The  required  minimum  wind-speed  for  most  of  the  suggested  installation 
designs  is  about  2  m/s.  The  probability  of  this  low  wing  speed  at  high  altitude  is  very  small  (less 
0.001).  This  minimum  may  be  decreased  still  further  by  using  the  turning  propeller  in  an  autogiro 
mode.  If  the  wind  speed  is  approximately  zero,  the  rotor  can  be  supported  in  the  atmosphere  by  a 
balloon (dirigible) as is shown on fig.1c or a propeller rotated by the ground power station as is shown 
on fig.1d. The rotor system may also land on the ground and start again when the wind speed attains 
the minimum speed for flight.
  A Gusty winds. Large pulsations of wind (aerodynamic energy) can be smoothed out by inertial fly-
wheels. 

  The suggested Method and Installations for utilization of wind energy has following peculiarities from 
current conventional methods and installations:
1.  Proposed installation allows the collection of energy from a large area – tens and even hundreds of 
times  more  than  conventional  wind  turbines.  This  is  possible  because  an  expensive  tower  is  not 
needed  to  fix  our  rotor  in  space.  Our  installation  allows  the  use  of  a  rotor  with  a  very  large 
diameter, for example 100-200 meters or more. 

3. 

2.  The proposed wind installations can be located at high altitude 100 m - 14 km. The wind speeds are 
2-4  times  faster  and  more  stable  at  high  altitude  compared  to  ground  surface  winds  used  by  the 
altitude  of  conventional  windmills  (10-70  meters  of  height).  In  certain  geographic  areas  high 
altitude wind flows have a continuous or permanent nature.  Since wind power increases at the cube 
of wind speed, wind rotor power increases by 27 times when wind speed increases by 3 times.
In proposed wind installation the electric generator is located at ground. There are proposals where 
electric generator located near a wind rotor and sends electric current to a ground by electric wares. 
However, our rotor and power are very large (see projects below).   Proposed installations produce 
more  power  by  thousands  of  times  compared to  the  typical  current wind  ground  installation  (see 
point 1, 2 above). The electric generator of 20 MW weighs about 100 tons (specific weigh of the 
conventional electric generator is about 3-10 kg/kW). It is impossible to keep this weigh by wing at 
high altitude for wind speed lesser then 150 m/s.

4.  One of the main innovations of the given invention is the cable transfer (transmission) of energy 
from the wind rotor located at high altitude to the electric generator located on ground. In proposed 
Installation  it  is  used a new cable transmission  made from artificial fibers. This  transmission has 
less  a  weigh  in  thousands  times  then  copper  electric  wires  of  equal  power.  The  wire  having 
diameter  more  5  mm  passes  1-2  ampere/sq.mm.  If  the  electric  generator  produces  20  MW  with 
voltage 1000  Volts,  the wire  cross-section area must  be  20,000  mm2,  (wire diameter is160  mm). 
The cross-section area of the cable transmission of equal power is only 37 mm2 (cable diameter 6.8 
mm2 for cable speed 300 m/s and admissible stress 200 kg/mm2, see Project 1). The specific weight 
of copper is 8930 kg/m3, the specific weight of artificial fibers is 1800 kg/m3. If the cable length for 

6

altitude 10 km is 25 km the double copper wire weighs 8930 tons (!!), the fiber transmission cable 
weighs only 3.33 tons.  It means the offered cable transferor energy of equal length is easier in 2682 
times, then copper wire.  The copper wires is very expensive, the artificial fiber is cheap.

   All  previous  attempts  to  place  the  generator  near  the  rotor  and  connect  it  to  ground  by  electric 
transmission wires were not successful because the generator and wires are heavy. 

Some information about wind energy

  The power of a wind  engine  strongly depends on the wind speed (to the third power). Low altitude 
wind (H = 10 m) has the standard average speed V = 6 m/s. High altitude wind is powerful and that has 
another important advantage, it is stable and constant.  This is true practically everywhere.
   Wind in the troposphere and stratosphere are powerful and permanent.  For example, at an altitude of 
5 km, the average wind speed is about 20 M/s, at an altitude 10-12 km the wind may reach 40 m/s (at 
latitude of about 20-350N). 
  There  are  permanent  jet  streams  at  high  altitude.  For  example,  at  H  =  12-13  km  and  about  250N 
latitude. The average wind speed at its core is about 148 km/h  (41 m/s). The most intensive portion, 
with a maximum speed 185 km/h (51 m/s) latitude 220, and 151 km/h (42 m/s) at latitude 350 in North 
America. On a given winter day, speeds in the jet core may exceed 370 km/h (103 m/s) for a distance 
of several hundred miles along the direction of the wind. Lateral wind shears in the direction normal to 
the jet stream may be 185 km/h per 556 km to right and 185 km/h per 185 km to the left.
  The wind speed of V = 40 m/s at an altitude H = 13 km provides 64 times more energy than surface 
wind speeds of  6 m/s at an altitude of  10 m.
  This  is  a  gigantic  renewable  and  free  energy  source.  (See  reference:  Science  and  Technolody,v.2, 
p.265).

Cable transmission energy problem

  The primary innovations presented in this paper are locating the rotor at high altitude, and an energy 
transfer system using a cable to transfer mechanical energy from the rotor to a ground power station.   
The critical factor for this transfer system is the weight of the cable, and its air drag.
  Twenty  years  ago,  the  mass  and  air  drag  of  the  required  cable would  not  allow  this  proposal  to  be 
possible.  However, artificial fibers are currently being manufactured, which have tensile strengths of 
3-5  times  more than  steel and densities  4-5  times  less then steel.   There are also experimental fibers 
(whiskers) which have tensile strengths 30-100 times more than a steel and densities 2 to 5 times less 
than steel.  For example, in the book [6] p.158 (1989), there is a fiber (whisker) CD, which has a tensile 
strength of  = 8000 kg/mm2 and density (specific gravity) of  = 3.5 g/cm3.  If we use an estimated 
strength of 3500 kg/mm2 ( =7.1010 N/m2,  = 3500 kg/m3), then the ratio is / = 0.110-6 or / = 
10106. Although the described (1989) graphite fibers are strong (/ = 10106), they are at least still 
ten  times  weaker  than  theory  predicts.  A  steel  fiber  has  a  tensile  strength  of  5000  MPA  (500 
kg/sq.mm),  the  theoretical  limit  is  22,000  MPA  (2200  kg/mm2)(1987);  the  polyethylene  fiber  has  a 
tensile  strength  20,000  MPA  with  a  theoretical  limit  of  35,000  MPA  (1987).  The  very  high  tensile 
strength is due to its nanotubes structure. 
  Apart  from  unique  electronic  properties,  the  mechanical  behavior  of  nanotubes  also  has  provided 
interest because nanotubes are seen as the ultimate carbon fiber, which can be used as reinforcements 
in  advanced  composite  technology.  Early  theoretical  work  and  recent  experiments  on  individual 
nanotubes (mostly MWNT’s,  Multi  Wall  Nano  Tubes) have confirmed that nanotubes are one of the 
stiffest materials ever made. Whereas carbon-carbon covalent bonds are one of the strongest in nature, 
a structure based on a perfect arrangement of these bonds oriented along the axis of nanotubes would 
produce an exceedingly strong material. Traditional carbon fibers show high strength and stiffness, but 

7
fall  far  short  of  the  theoretical,  in-plane  strength  of  graphite  layers  by  an  order  of  magnitude. 
Nanotubes come close to being the best fiber that can be made from graphite. 
  For  example,  whiskers  of  Carbon  nanotube  (CNT)  material  have  a  tensile  strength  of  200  Giga-
Pascals and a Young’s modulus over 1 Tera Pascals (1999).  The theory predicts 1 Tera Pascals and a 
Young’s modules of 1-5 Tera Pascals. The hollow structure of nanotubes makes them very light (the 
specific  density  varies  from  0.8  g/cc  for  SWNT’s  (Single  Wall  Nano  Tubes)  up  to  1.8  g/cc  for 
MWNT’s, compared to 2.26 g/cc for graphite or 7.8 g/cc for steel). 
  Specific strength (strength/density) is important in the design of the systems presented in this paper; 
nanotubes have values at least 2 orders of magnitude greater than steel. Traditional carbon fibers have a 
specific strength 40 times that of steel. Since nanotubes are made of graphitic carbon, they have good 
resistance  to  chemical  attack  and  have  high  thermal  stability.  Oxidation  studies  have  shown  that  the 
onset of oxidation shifts  by about 1000 C or higher in nanotubes compared to high modulus graphite 
fibers. In a vacuum, or reducing atmosphere, nanotube structures will be stable to any practical service 
temperature. 
  The  artificial  fibers  are cheap and  widely used  in  tires and everywhere.   The price of SiC  whiskers 
produced by Carborundum Co. with =20,690 MPa and =3.22 g/cc was $440 /kg in 1989. The market 
price of nanotubes is too high presently (~$200 per gram)(2000). In the last 2-3 years, there have been 
several companies that were organized in the US to produce and market nanotubes. It is anticipated that 
in the next few years, nanotubes will be available to consumers for less than $100/pound. 
   Below, the  author  provides  a brief overview of recent research  information  regarding the proposed 
experimental (tested) fibers. In addition, the author also addresses additional examples, which appear 
in  these  projects  and  which  can  appear  as  difficult  as  the  proposed  technology  itself.  The  author  is 
prepared to discuss the problems with organizations which are interested in research and development 
related projects.

  For example, if  =200 kg/mm2,  =1800 kg/m3, then Es=0.56 MJ/kg or Es=0.15 kWh/kg.
  For comparison of the different ground wind installations their efficiency and parameters are 
computed for the standard wind conditions: the wind speed equals V=6 m/s at the altitude H=10 m. 

Projects
Project 1
High-speed air propeller rotor (fig.1)
  For example, let us consider a rotor diameter of 100 m (A = 7850 m2), at an altitude H = 10 km (= 
0.4135 kg/m3), wind speed of V = 30 m/s , an efficiency coefficient of = 0.5, and a cable tensile stress 
of = 200 kg/mm2 .
 Then the power produced is  N  = 22 MW  [Eq.  (1)], which  is sufficient for city with a population  of 
250,000. The rotor drag is Dr = 73 tons [Eq.(4)], the cross-section of the main cable area is S =1.4Dr/σ
=l.3573/0.2  500 mm2, the cable diameter equals d =25 mm; and the cable weight is W =22.5 tons 
[Eq.(9)] (for L=25 km). The cross-section of the transmission cable is S = 36.5 mm2 [Eq.(8)], d = 6.8 
mm, weight of two transmission cables  is W = 3.33 tons for cable speed v =300 m/s [Eq.(9)].
 The  required  wing  size  is  20100  m  (CL=0.8)  [Eq.(12)],  wing  area  served  by  ailerons  is  820  sq.m 
[Eq.(13)]. If CL=2, the minimum speed is 2 m/s [Eq.(14)].
  The  installation  will  produce  an  annual  energy  E =190  GWh  [Eq.(7)].    If  the  installation  cost  is 
$200K, has a useful life of 10 years, and requires maintenance of $50K per year, the production cost is 
c = 0.37 cent per kWh [Eq(10)]. If retail price is $0.15 per kWh, profit $0.1 per kWh, the total annual 
profit is $19 millions per year [Eq.(11)].  

The project #2
Large air propeller at altitude H = 1 km (fig.1)
Let us consider a propeller diameter of 300 m, with an area A = 7104 m2, at an altitude H = 1 km, and 
a wind speed of 13 m/s. The average blade tip speed is 78 m/s.
The full potential power of the wind streamer flow is 94.2 MW. If the coefficient of efficiency is 0.5 
the  useful  power  is  N  =  47.1 MW.  For other wind speed. the  useful power is:  V  = 5  m/s,    N  = 23.3 
MW; V = 6 m/s,  N = 47.1 MW; V = 7 m/s,  N = 74.9 MW; V = 8 m/s,  N = 111.6 MW;  V = 9 m/s,  N = 
159 MW; V = 10 m/s,   N =218 MW.

Estimation of economical efficiency
 Let  us  assume  that  the  cost  of  the  Installation  is  $3  million,  a  useful  life  of  10  years,  and  request 
maintenance of $100,000/year. The energy produced in one year is E = 407 GWh [Eq.(7)]. The basic 
cost of energy is $0.01 /kWh. 

The some technical parameters
Altitude H = 1 km
  The  drag is  about  360  tons.  Ground  connection  (main) cable  has  cross-section  area of 1800  sq,mm 
[Eq.(8’)], d = 48 mm, and has a weight of 6480 kg. The need wing area is 60x300 m. The aileron area 
requested for turbine balance is 6740 sq.m.
  If the transmission cable speed is 300 m/s, the cross-section area of transmission cable is 76 sq.mm 
and the cable weight is 684 kg (composite fiber).

Altitude H = 13 km
 At an altitude of H =13 km. the air density is ρ=0.2666, and the wind speed is V = 40 m/s. The power 
for efficiency coefficient 0.5 is 301.4 MgW. The drag of the propeller is approximately 754 tons. The 
connection cable has a cross-sectional area of 3770 sq.mm, a diameter is d =70 mm and a weight of 
176  tons.  The  transmission  cable  has  a  sectional  area  5  sq.c  and  a  weight  of  60  tons  (vertical 
transmission only 12 tons).

10
  The  installation  will  produce  energy  E=2604  GWh  per  year.  If  the  installation  costs  $5  million, 
maintenance is $200,000/year, and the cost of 1 kWh will be $0.0097/kWh.   

Project #3 
Air low speed wind engine with free flying cable flexible rotor (fig.2)
   Let us consider the size of cable rotor of width 50 m, a rotor diameter of 1000 m, then the rotor area 
is A=501000=50,000 sq.m.  The angle rope to a horizon is 70o. The angle of ratio lift/drag is about 
2.5o.
  The average conventional wind speed at an altitude H = 10 m is V = 6 m/s. It means that the speed at 
the altitude 1000 m is 11.4 - 15 m/s. Let us take average wind speed V=13 m/s at an altitude H = 1 km.
The power of flow is

N=0.5.V3Acos200=0.51.2251331000500.94=63 MW .

If the coefficient efficiency is = 0.2 the power of installation is
= 0.263 = 12.5 MW .

  The energy 12.5 MW is enough for a city with a population at 150,000.
If  we  decrease  our  Installation  to  a  100x2000  m  the  power  decreases  approximately  by  6  times 
(because the area decreases by 4 times, wind speed reaches more 15 m/s at this altitude. Power will be 
75 MW. This is enough for a city with a population about 1 million of people.
   If the average wind speed is different for given location the power for the basis installation will be: V 
=5 m/s,  N =7.25 MW; V =6 m/s,  N =12.5 MW; V=7 m/s,  N = 19.9 MW; V = 8 m/s,  N = 29,6 MW; 
V = 9 m/s,  N = 42.2 MW; V = 10 m/s,  N = 57.9 MW.

Economical efficiency
  Let us assume that the cost of our installation is $1 million. According to the book “Wind Power” by 
P.  Gipe  [2],  the  conventional  wind  installation  with  the  rotor  diameter  7  m  costs  $20,000  and  for 
average  wind  speeds of  6  m/s  has  power 2.28  kW,  producing 20,000  kWh  per year. To  produce  the 
same  amount  of  power  as  our  installation  using  by  conventional  methods,  we  would  need  5482 
(12500/2.28)  conventional  rotors,  costing  $110  million.      Let  us  assume  that  our  installation  has  a 
useful life of 10 years and a maintenance cost is $50,000/year. Our installation produces 109,500,000 
kWh  energy  per year. Production  costs of energy will  be  approximately 150,000/109,500,000  = 0.14  
cent/kWh.  The  retail  price  of  1  kWh  of  energy  in  New  York  City  is  $0.15  now.  The  revenue  is  16 
millions. If profit from 1 kWh is $0.1, the total profit is more 10 millions per year.
Estimation some technical parameters
  The  cross-section  of  main  cable  for  an  admissible  fiber  tensile  strange   =  200kg/sq.mm  is  S 
=2000/0.2 = 10,000 mm2.  That is two cable of diameter d =80 mm. The weight of the cable for density 
1800 kg/m3 is

W = SL = 0.01.2000.1800 = 36 tons .
  Let us assume that the weight of 1 sq.m of blade is 0.2 kg/m2 and the weight of 1 m of bulk is 2 kg. 
The weight of the 1 blade will be 0.2 x 500 = 100 kg, and 200 blades are 20 tons. If the weight of one 
bulk is 0.1 ton, the weight of 200 bulks is 20 tons.
 The total weight of main parts of the installation will be 94 tons. We assume 100 tons for purposes of 
our calculations.
 The minimum wind speed when the flying rotor can supported in the air is (for Cy = 2)

V=(2W/CyS)0.5=(2100104/21.225200500)0.5 = 2.86 m/s
  The probability of the wind speed falling below 3 m/s when the average speed is 12 m/s, is zero, and 
for 10 m/s is 0.0003. This equals 2.5 hours in one year, or less than one time per year. The wind at high 
altitude has greater speed and stability than near ground surface. There is a strong wind at high altitude 
even when wind near the ground is absent. This can be seen when the clouds move in a sky on a calm 
day.

Project #4
Low speed air drag rotor (fig.3)
   Let us consider a parachute with a diameter of 100 m, length of rope 1500 m, distance between the 
parachutes 300 m, number of parachute 3000/300 = 10, number of worked parachute 5, the area of one 
parachute is 7850 sq.m, the total work area is A = 5 x 7850 = 3925 sq.m.  The full power of the flow is 
5.3 MW for V=6 m/s. If coefficient of efficiency is 0.2 the useful power is N = 1 MW. For other wind 
speed the useful power is: V =5 m/s,  N =0.58 MW; V =6 m/s,  N = 1 MW; V =7 m/s,  N =1.59 MW; V 
= 8 m/s,  N=2.37 MW; V = 9 m/s, N =3.375 MW; V = 10 m/s, N = 4.63 MW.

Estimation of economical efficiency
   Let  us  take  the  cost  of  the  installation  $0.5  million,  a  useful  life  of  10  years  and  maintenance  of 
$20,000/year.  The  energy  produced  in  one  year  (when  the  wind  has  standard  speed  6  m/s)  is  E  = 
1000x24x360 = 8.64 million kWh. The basic cost of energy is 70,000/8640,000 = 0.81 cent/kWh.

The some technical parameters
  If the thrust is 23 tons, the tensile stress is 200 kg/sq.mm (composed fiber), then the parachute cable 
diameter is 12 mm, The full weight of the installation is 4.5 tons. The support wing has size 25x4 m. 
Project #5
High speed air Darreus rotor at an altitude 1 km (fig.4)
  Let us consider a rotor having the diameter of 100 m, a length of 200 m (work area is 20,000 sq.m). 
When the wind speed at an altitude H=10 m is V =6 m/s, then at an altitude H = 1000 m it is 13 m/s. 
The full wind  power is  13,46 MW.  Let us take the efficiency coefficient 0.35, then the power of the 
Installation will be N = 4.7 MW. The change of power from wind speed is: V = 5 m/s,  N = 2.73 MW; 
V = 6 m/s,  N = 4.7 MW; V = 7 m/s,  N = 7.5 MW; V = 8 m/s,  N = 11.4 MW; V = 9m/s,  N = 15.9 MW; 
V = 10 m/s, N = 21.8 MW.  
  At  an  altitude  of  H  =  13  km  with  an  air  density  0.267  and  wind  speed  V  =  40  m/s,  the  given 
installation will produce power N = 300 MW.

Estimation of economical efficiency
    Let us  take the cost  of the  Installation  at $1 million,  a useful life  of 10 years, and maintenance of 
$50,000  /year.  Our  installation  will  produce  E  =  41  millions  kWh  per  year    (when  the  wind  speed 
equals 6 m/s at an altitude 10 m). The prime cost will be 150,000/41,000,000 = 0.37 cent/kWh. If the 
customer price is $0.15/kWh and profit from 1 kWh is $0.10 /kWh the profit will be $4.1 million per 
year.

Estimation of technical parameters
   The  blade  speed  is  78  m/s.  Numbers  of  blade  is  4.  Number  of  revolution  is  0.25  revolutions  per 
second. The size of blade is 200x0.67 m. The weight of 1 blade is 1.34 tons. The total weight of the 
Installation  is  about  8  tons.  The  internal  wing  has  size  200x2.3  m.  The  additional  wing  has  size 
200x14.5 m and weight 870 kg. The cross-section area of the cable transmission having an altitude of 
H = 1 km is 300 sq.mm, the weight is 1350 kg.

Project #6
Ground Wind High Speed Engine (fig.5)
  Let us  consider the ground wind installation (fig.5) with size 500x500x50 meters. The work area is 
500x50x2= 50,000 sq.m. The  tower is 60 meter tall, the flexible rotor located from 10 m to 60 m. If 
the wind speed at altitude 10 m is 6 m/s, that equals 7.3 m/s at altitude 40 m.
 The theoretical power is 

Nt = 0.5V3A = 0.51.2257.335104 =11.9  MgW.

  For coefficient of the efficiency equals 0.45 the useful power is
N = 0.4511.9=5.36  MW.

12
For other wind speed at an altitude 6 m/s the useful power is: V = 5 m/s,  N = 3.1 MW; V = 6 m/s,  N = 
5.36 MW; V = 7 m/s,  N = 8.52 MW; V = 8 m/s,  N = 12.7 MW; V = 9 m/s,  N = 18.1 MW; V = 10 
m/s,  N = 24.8 MW.

Economic estimation
  In this installation the rotor will be less expensive than previous installations because the high-speed 
rotor  has  a  smaller  number  of  blades  and  smaller  blades  (see  technical  data  below).  However  this 
installation needs 4 high (60 m) columns. Take the cost of the installation at $1 million with a useful 
life of 10 years. The maintenance is projected at about $50,000 /year.
  This  installation  will  produce  E =  5360  kW  x  8760  hours  =  46.95  MWh  energy  (for  the  annual 
average  wind-speed    V  =  6  m/s  at  H  =  10  m).  The  cost  of  1  kWh  is  150,000/46,950,000  =  0.4 
cent/kWh. If the retail price is $0.15/kWh and delivery cost 30%, the profit is $0.10 per kWh, or $4.7 
million per year.

Estimation of some technical parameters
  The blade speed is 6 x  7.3 = 44 m/s. The distance between blades is 44 m. The number of blade is 
4000/44 = 92.

Discussion and Conclusion
   Conventional  windmills  are approached their maximum  energy extraction potential relative to their 
installation cost. No relatively progress has been made in windmill technology in the last 50 years. The 
wind  energy  is  free,  but  its  production  more  expensive  then  its  production  in  heat  electric  stations. 
Current wind installations cannot essential decrease a cost of kWh, stability of energy production. They 
cannot  increase  of  power  of  single  energy  unit.  The  renewable  energy  industry  needs  revolutionary 
ideas that improve performance parameters (installation cost and power per unit) and that significantly 
decreases  (in  10-20  times)  the  cost  of  energy  production.  This  paper  offers  ideas  that  can  move  the 
wind energy industry from stagnation to revolutionary potential. 
  The following is a list of benefits provided by the proposed system compared to current installations:
1.  The produced energy at least in 10 times cheaper then energy received of all conventional electric 

stations includes current wind installation.

2.  The  proposed  system  is  relatively  inexpensive  (no  expensive  tower),  it  can  be  made  with  a  very 
large thus capturing wind energy from an enormous area (hundreds of times more than typical wind 
turbines).

3.  The  power  per  unit  of  proposed  system  in  some  hundreds  times  more  of  typical  current  wind 

installations.

4.  The proposed installation not requires large ground space.
5.  The installation may be located near customers and not require expensive high voltage equipment. 
It is not necessary to have long, expensive, high-voltage transmission lines and substations. Ocean
going vessels can use this installation for its primary propulsion source.

6.  No noise and bad views. 
7.  The energy production is more stability because the wind is steadier at high altitude. The wind may 
be  zero  near  the  surface  but  it  is  typically  strong  and  steady  at  higher  altitudes.  This  can  be 
observed  when  it  is  calm    on  the  ground,  but  clouds  are  moving  in  the  sky.  There  are  a  strong 
permanent air streams at a high altitude at many regions of the USA.

8.  The installation can be easy relocated in other place.  
    As with any new idea, the suggested concept is in need of research and development. The theoretical 
problems  do  not  require  fundamental  breakthroughs.  It  is  necessary  to  design  small,  free  flying 
installations  to  study  and  get  an  experience  in  the  design,  launch,  stability,  and  the  cable  energy 
transmission from a flying wind turbine to a ground electric generator.
  This  paper  has  suggested  some  design  solutions  from  patent  application  [4].  The  author  has  many 
detailed analysis in addition to these presented projects. Organizations interested in these projects can

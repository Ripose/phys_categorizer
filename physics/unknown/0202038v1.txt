Abstract

This paper presents the development of a new technology of registration of ionizing

radiation  and  a  new  type  of  detectors  –  single-cathode  multiwire  porous  detector  with

neither a  gaseous nor  semiconductor,  but  a  porous  dielectric  substance,  e.g.,  CsI,  being

used  as  working  medium.  It  is  shown  that  the  performance  of  the  multiwire  porous

detector  is  stable,  ensuring  highly  efficient  detection  of  both  heavily  ionizing  particles

and  soft  X-rays  with  a  spatial  resolution  better  than  – 60m m.  The  continuous  stable

performance opens up new perspectives for using porous detectors in research as well as

medicine.  The  obtained  data  are  basic  for  the  development  of  the  theory  of  the

phenomenon of electrons’ drift and multiplication in porous dielectrics under the action

of a strong external electric field.

1.  Introduction

Porous detectors represent a new radiation detection technology and have a number

of  remarkable  features.  The  use  of  porous  dielectrics  as  working  media  in  radiation

detectors  is  a  novalty  in  the  radiation  detection  technique.  Unique  physical  properties,

such as  stable performance for a long time, high spatial resolution (– 60m m), good  time

resolution  (£ 60ps),  low  intrinsic  noises,  short  pulses  (£ 1ps),  high  efficiency  of

registration  of  minimum  and  highly  ionizing  particles  as  well  as  X-rays  and  low  cost

allow them to be widely used in high-energy and nuclear physics experiments as well as

in research, engineering and medicine. For example, low amount of material on the path

of particles (5· 10-4g/cm2) and the possibility of operation in vacuum permit their use in

time-of-flight  devices  and  for  beam  monitoring  in  vacuum  chambers  of  accelerators.

Operation  in  vacuum  allows  them  to  be  used  also  in  space  and  other  experiments.  The

technology of preparation of porous dielectric layers permits fabrication of detectors with

an area of several hundreds of  square  centimeters.  In  case  of  using  materials  with  high

atomic number Z, one can ensure high efficiency of X-ray detection and usage of porous

detectors  as  large  area  image  detectors  of  X-rays.  The  detection  efficiency  of  thermal

neutrons  in  these  detectors  will  be  high  if  substances  having  a  high  neutron  absorption

cross-section, e.g., LiF, GdCl3, are used as fillers. It is important that these detectors are

comparatively low cost owing to the fact that the working materials to be used may be of

not the highest purity  (£ 99.98%),  and,  unlike  semiconductor  detectors,  their  fabrication

technology is simple.

2

Porous  CsI,  KCl,  etc.  are  being  used  as  working  media  in  porous  detectors.

Operation of these detectors is based on the effect of collision ionization electrons’ drift

and  multiplication  in  porous  media  under  the  action  of  an  external  electric  field.  The

macroscopic  mechanism  of  initiation  of  electrons’  drift  and  multiplication  (EDM)  in

porous dielectrics under the action of an external electric field and under the action of the

field  of  charges  having  been  accumulated  on  the  surface  of  dielectrics  (initiating  an

anomalous  secondary  electron  emission  (ASEE)  (Molter  Effect)  [1-7])  is  roughly  the

same  –  in  both  cases,  there  takes  place  an  avalanche  multiplication  of  electrons  having

been  accelerated  in  the  pores.  In  the  second  case,  however,  large  space  and  surface

charges  in  porous  medium  lead  to  substantial  alterations  in  the  physical  processes  and

substantial divergences in the characteristics of these two phenomena.

The  effect  of  ASEE  within  the  range  of  KeV  primary  electrons  has  been

experimentally  studied  quite  well  (see,  e.g.,  ref.  [5]).  However,  the  large  diversity  of

effects due to  both  unknown  amount  of  impurities  in  the  emitters  being  used  and  large

space  charge,  make  this  problem  a  very  complicated  one,  and,  as  far  as  the  author  is

informed,  there  presently  exists  no  comprehensive  microscopic  theory  on 

this

phenomenon.  And  what  is  more,  such  manner  of  initiation  of  an  electric  field  makes

ASEE inertial, non-controllable and unstable, and in case of minimum ionizing particles,

the  average  secondary  electron  emission  coefficient  is  low,  m =1  [6,7].  That  is  why  the

experiments on using this phenomenon for radiation detection were a failure.

The effect of EDM in porous media under the action of an external electric field at

bombardment by ionizing particles and soft X-rays was first observed and systematically

studied  by  the  group  headed  by  the  author  in  Yerevan  Physics  Institute  in  the  early

3

1970ies  [8-13].  To  observe  this  effect,  Lorikyan  M.P,  Trofimchuk  N.N.  et  al.  [8,9]

prepared porous emitters of secondary electrons, which consisted of two fine-mesh grids

with the gap between them filled with porous dielectric. A voltage was applied over the

grids,  and  the  emission  characteristics  were  measured  at  the  emitter’s  traversal  by

minimum ionizing particles. Fig.1 shows the number of secondary electrons emitted from

porous layers of different thickness per primary electron as a function of the strength of

electric  field.  It  was  shown  that  the  process  of  electron  emission  was  non-inertial,

controllable and stable. The obtained results showed that the phenomenon could be used

for particle detection.

Lorikyan M.P. and Trofimchuk N.N. created a porous detector with such an emitter

[10].  That  detector’s  efficiency  for  registration  of  a -particles  with  » 5MeV  energy  was

100%,  and  the  average  number  of  electrons  emitted  per  one  a -particle  was  ne=270,

reaching ne=2· 103 in ref. [14]. These results were confirmed in refs. [11-17].

On the basis of these investigations, the researchers of the same group created and

studied  multiwire  porous  detectors  (MPD)  of  radiation  [18-28].  It  was  shown,  that  the

time resolution of these detectors was £ 60ps; the efficiency of registration of minimum

ionizing  particles  and  a -particles  with  5MeV  energy,  h =100%;  and  the  coordinate

resolution  was  better  than  250m m.  The  main  disadvantage  of  these  detectors  was  that

their performance was stable at a pulsed mode of operation, making them inefficient.

In the present work, porous multiwire detectors filled with CsI of 99.98 purity were

developed and assembled at maximum possible cleanliness of all detector-manufacturing

procedures. It was shown that such detectors performed stable at a constant voltage feed,

i.e.  at  a  continuous  mode  of  operation,  which  means  that  the  polarization  effects

4

manifested themselves weakly. Continuous-operation porous detectors strongly  enhance

the  possibility  of  using  porous  detectors,  and  are  a  stimulus  to  the  development  of  a

quantitative  theory  of  electrons’  drift  and  multiplication  in  porous  dielectrics  under  the

action of electric field and ionizing radiation.

Drift  and  multiplication  of  electrons  in  dielectrics  under  the  action  of  an  external

electric  field  has  not  yet  been  studied  well  even  experimentally.  Porous  detectors  of

ionizing radiation are still under development.

For details in this field refer to ref. [26].

2.  On the Principle of Operation of Porous Detectors

Note that the absence of a microscopic theory on effective drift and multiplication

of  collision  ionization  electrons  in  porous  dielectrics  under  the  action  of  an  external

electric  field  is  seriously  limiting  the  possibility  for  a  quantitative  interpretation  of  the

obtained  and  prediction  of  the  expected  results,  also  is  a  serious  hindrance  to  optimal

conduction of experiments.

It is obvious, that efficient performance of porous detectors depends entirely on the

number  of  primary-particle-induced  d -electrons  and  on  the  efficiency  of  d -electron-

induced secondary electron emission from pore walls.

Qualitatively  the  microscopic  mechanism  of  EDM  in  porous  dielectrics  under  the

action of an external electric field can be represented as follows. In pore walls, primary

particles knock out electrons from different energy bands of the dielectric, except for the

conduction band, as it is vacant in dielectrics at the beginning. Part of these electrons in

5

the  same pore  wall and part  of electrons having penetrated into other pores and  getting

accelerated  there  produce  electrons  in  other  pore  walls  and  transfer  them  into  the

conduction band. Electrons thus occupy the conduction band. In the conduction band, the

electrons deposit energy mainly due to their interaction with phonons. Eventually, part of

electrons occupy levels in the conduction band’s bottom and higher, and part of electrons

having  energies higher than the electron affinity c

 of the surface of the material escape

from the pore walls into vacuum (into pores). The electrons are accelerated in the pores

under the applied electric field and the same processes occur on the walls of other pores.

These processes occur with all generations of secondary electrons, and if c

 is small, the

average coefficient of secondary electron emission in each act of electron collision with

pore walls s >1, then an avalanche multiplication of electrons  takes  place  in  the  porous

medium.

Under regular conditions c

 is high for dielectrics, thermal electrons do not take part

in the process of emission, and initiation of cascade processes of electron multiplication

is  practically  impossible.  But  c

  may  significantly  drop  in  materials  with  P-type

conduction  under  the  action  of  an  electric  field,  because  the  electric  field  pushes  the

acceptor-induced holes from the near-surface regions of the walls of pores situated on the

positive electrode side deeper into the bulk, forming a depletion zone in the close vicinity

of that surface with an excess of negative charges (acceptors) in it. The field induced by

these charges pushes the conduction band electrons towards the surface of pore partitions

and  facilitates  their  escape,  i.e.  c

  drops.  Decrease  of  c

  results  in  the  fact,  that  thermal

electrons  also  contribute  to  the  emission  process,  significantly  outnumbering  the  hot

electrons.  Decrease  of  c

  increases  also  the  thickness  of  the  layer  (escape  depth)  from

6

which these electrons can reach the surface and escape into vacuum, as thermal electrons

are depositing little energy [28]. All these effects secure a high coefficient of secondary

electron emission from every pore wall and efficient drift and multiplication of electrons

in porous medium.

In case of anomalous secondary electron emission (ASEE), the processes described

above  take  place  in  the  presence  of  large  surface  and  space  charges  (as  ASEE  arises

under  the  influence  of  these  charges)  which  keep  continuously  changing.  So,  drift  and

multiplication  of  electrons  takes  place  in  the  presence  of  a  large  number  of  capturing

centers, and the electrons’ drift and multiplication becomes inertial and non-stable owing

to  the  fact,  that  the  number  of  these  charges  is  in  a  direct  dependence  on  the  factor  of

multiplication of electrons.

Dielectrics  have  a  high  specific  conductance.  This  is  good  from  the  viewpoint  of

intrinsic noises of porous detectors, but the usage of dielectrics as working media faces a

problem connected with the defects in the crystalline structure, which are charge-carrier

capturing  centers  and  are  responsible  for  the  formation  of  a  large  space  charge.  The

direction of the space charge’s electric field is opposite to that of the external field, that is

why the  efficiency  of  electrons’ drift and multiplication decreases, and in the course of

time  the  drift  of  charge  carriers  stops,  i.e.  the  polarization  effects  are  undoubtedly

affecting the counting response of MPD. Space charge itself is also an additional trap for

charge  carriers.  Loss  of  charge  carriers  reduces  the  amplitude  and  increases  the

fluctuations  of  detector  pulses.  Slowing-down  of  the  charge  carriers’  drift  to  the

electrodes  introduces  additional  fluctuations  in  the  carrier  accumulation  time,  i.e.

deteriorates the detector’s time resolution.

7

Besides,  under  the  action  of  the  summary  field  of  external  electrodes  and  space

charges,  the  electrons  get  a  transverse  momentum,  deteriorating  the  detector’s  spatial

resolution.  And  what  is  more,  the  space  charge  grows  in  the  course  of  operation  of

detector,  changing  the  electric  field  in  the  working  medium  and  deteriorating  the

conditions  of  electrons’  drift  and  multiplication.  So,  detectors  with  dielectric  working

media  having  a  notable  density  of  carrier-capturing  centers  will  have  a  poor  spatial,

energy  and  time  resolution  and  unstable  performance.  These  effects  have  been  already

observed  in  earlier  refs.  [18-27].  Beside  this  kind  of  traps  in  materials,  there  exist  also

impurities/traps,  that  is  why  the  working  medium’s  purity  is  so  crucial  for  normal

operation of porous detectors [29].

In ionization radiation detectors with porous working media made of dielectrics, the

loss of charge  carriers is compensated by multiplication of electrons on pore partitions.

However, one should not expect from porous dielectrics an energy resolution comparable

with the energy resolution of semiconductor detectors, as capturing of charge-carriers and

vigorous electron multiplication introduce fluctuations in the height of the detector pulse.

3.  The Experimental Method

The MPD being tested had porous CsI of 99.98–99.99 purity. The porous CsI layer

was prepared  by  means  of  thermal  deposition  of  CsI  in  an  Ar  atmosphere  [40].  Porous

CsI was deposited on the cathode. The thickness and density of layer were a function of

deposition time, pressure of Ar, distance from the cathode to the vessel l from which CsI

was evaporated, and temperature of the vessel. In our case, CsI was melted in a tantalum

8

vessel.  A  porous  CsI  layer  with  a  density  of  about  0.4%  of  single  crystal  density  was

deposited at an Ar pressure of p=3Torr, l=6.5cm, and a deposition rate of 43m m/min. A

density  of  0.75%  was  obtained  at  p=3Torr,  l=5cm.  The  detector  was  assembled  in  the

atmosphere of Ar immediately after CsI was deposited. After assembly, the detector was

placed in a pressurized container filled with Ar and moved into a vacuum chamber. The

measurements  were  taken  under  (7–9)· 10-3Torr  vacuum.  All  detector  manufacturing

procedures were conducted under maximum possible technological clinliness.

To  estimate the coordinate resolution, the anode wires of MPD  were  divided  into

two groups. The first group included the even numbered anodes and the second group -

the odd numbered ones. The anodes in each  group were  connected to the inputs of fast

current amplifiers having a rise time of 1.5ns and a conversion ratio of 30mV/m A. After

amplification, the signals from the first and second groups were shaped and counted. The

shaped  pulses  from  each  group  were  simultaneously  fed  to  a  coincidence  circuit,  by

means of which the number of  events Nc, when the same particle was detected by both

groups, i.e., by two neighboring anodes (because the number of random coincidences was

negligibly small), was also readout. In case of Nc„ 0, it is obvious, that there is a strip in

between two neighboring anodes, where the particles incident on it are registered by both

anodes.  The  width  of  this  strip,  D x,  determines  the  detector’s  coordinate  resolution.

Denoting  the  spacing  between  the  anodes  by  b,  and  the  total  number  of  particles

registered by both anode wire groups by N0, we have:

D  x / b = Nc / N0,.      

                    (1)

and the number of particles registered by only the first or second group of anodes will be

equal to N(I)=n(I)-Nc/2 and N(II)=n(II)-Nc/2 respectively, where n(I) and n(II) denote the

9

number  of  pulses  at  the  output  of  odd-  and  even-numbered  anode  wire  groups,

respectively, i.e. the number of particles the detection of which induced shaped pulses at

the  output  of  the  first  and  second  anode  wire  groups.  The  total  number  of  particles

registered by the detector will be N(I)+N(II).

The  time  of  the  measurement  of  each  point  was  one  minute.  In  the  pauses

between the measurements the detectors were exposed to detected particles and a voltage.

When  detectors  were  turned  off,  air  evacuation  from  the  vacuum  chamber  stopped,

leaving the detectors in residual vacuum.

function of MPD were investigated.

The  dependence  of  n(I),  n(II),  Nc,  N(I)  and  N(II)  on  U,  and  the  time-stability

The  errors  in  all  cases  are  taken  to  be  statistical  and  are  not  indicated.  Intrinsic

noises were » 0.1-0.2s-1.

4.  Description of Detector

The schematic view of MPD is shown in Fig.2.

Anode  wires  1  are  stretched  across  the  surface  of  fiberglass  laminate  frame  2.

Porous CsI layer 6 is first deposited on cathode 4 made of 30-100m m-thick Al foil. Frame

2  is  fastened  to  the  cathode  with  porous  CsI  deposited  on  it.  The  Al  foil  is  stretched

across frame 5 made of fiberglass. Dielectric frame 3 serves for setting of the desired gap

between the cathode and anode. The thickness of deposited CsI layer, H, is larger than the

gap  between  the  cathode  and  anode  wires,  so  that  the  anode  wires  are  buried  in  the

porous layer.

10

In  the  MPD  tested,  the  anode  wires  are  made  of  gilded  tungsten  wire  having  a

diameter  of  25m m,  the  gap  being  0.5mm.  X-rays  were  incident  onto  the  porous  CsI

through a thin Al cathode, while a -particles got in the porous medium from the side of

anode wires.

5.  Results of Measurements

It was observed, that the thickness of porous CsI layer decreased after its thermal

deposition on the support plate, i.e. there took place compaction of the porous layer. Fig.3

shows how the thickness of porous CsI decreases in the course of time after its deposition

on  the  support  plate.  The  observed  compaction  of  CsI  layer  is  accompanied  by

crystallization  of  the  deposited  material  and  formation  of  a  polycrystalline  structure,

which leads to a decreasing number and density of bulk and surface defects that play a

major role in the process of electrons’ drift and multiplication and drift of holes under the

action of electric field.

Figs. 4, 5 and 6 present the results of measurements taken by MPD-1 with a porous

CsI  layer  having  a  density  of  r » 0.3%  and  a  thickness  of  H=0.8– 0.05mm  after  its

deposition, respectively. Anode  wires were spaced  at b=250m m.  The sensitive area  was

22· 22cm2.  The  detection  threshold  was  Vthr=35mV.  The  total  number  of  a -particles

incident on the whole detector was N0a =2562min-1.

Fig.4 shows the dependence of the number of a -particles detected by the first group

na (I) (crosses) and second group na (II) (points) of anode wires on voltage U in an hour

after putting MPD-1 together. Triangles show the number of coincidence pulses Nc from

11

the  first  and  second  groups  of  anode  wires,  i.e.  the  number  of  cases  when  the  same  a -

particle is detected by both groups of anode wires.

One  can  see  that  all  the  dependences  have  a  plateau,  and  within  the  errors  each

group  of  wires  is  counting  all  a -particles,  and  the  number  of  coincidence  pulses  Nc  is

equal  to  the  number  of  a -particles  registered  by  each  group  of  anode  wires  na (I)  and

na (II).  This  result  indicates  that  all  a -particles  are  in  parallel  registered  by  both

neighboring wires, i.e. the spatial resolution of MPD is worse than the distance between

the  anode  wires.  So,  the  efficiency  of  particle  detection  by  each  half  of  the  detector  is

expressed as h =na (I)/N0(I)=na (II)/N0(II)=Nc/N0, where N0(I) and N0(II) are the number of

a -particles incident on each half of the detector. On the plateaus h =99%.

The 

time-stability  function  of  MPD-1  measured 

immediately  after 

these

measurements  (Fig.4),  is  shown  in  Fig.5.  It  is  seen  that  the  detector’s  performance  is

stable for some time, but then Na , i.e. the detection efficiency, rapidly drops to zero and

remains  unchanged,  and  in  doing  so  MPD  stays  spatially  insensitive  all  the  time

(Nc=na (I)=na (II)).

After finishing these measurements (which lasted about 7 hours), we measured the

dependence of na (I) and na (II) on U. The results are presented in Fig.6. The comparison

of  Fig.4  with  Fig.6  shows  that  in  Fig.6,  first,  all  curves  shifted  to  the  right  by  » 125V,

second, na (I) and na (II) are twice as smaller and, third, Nc has drastically decreased, i.e.

after  working  about  7  hours,  each  group  of  anode  wires  had  been  detecting  particles

separately,  which  means  that  the  detector  became  spatially  sensitive.  Fig.6  also  shows

that  the  MPD’s  spatial  resolution  decreased  with  increasing  U.  The  real  number  of

particles detected in this case by, e.g., only one group of anode wires is Na (I)=na (I)–Nc/2,

12

labeled by squares in the same Figure. The time-stability measurements showed that the

MPD’s  performance  was  stable  with  a  100%  efficiency  of  registration  by  each  group.

After this, the MPD’s counting characteristics remained unchanged.

Fig.7 shows the results of measurements of U-dependence of na (I) (crosses), na (II)

(points)  and  Nc  (triangles)  by  analogous  MPD-2  with  r =0.4%  and  H=1.3m m.  The

measurements  were  conducted  at  N0a =2800min-1  and  Vthr=26mV,  in  one  hour  after

deposition of porous CsI. Again, as in the previous case, na (I)=na (II)=Nc, i.e. the detector

was  spatially insensitive. The measurements show that the time-stability  function  is  the

same as in the previous case (Fig.5).

Fig.8  shows  the  results  of  the  measurement  of  the  dependence  of  na (I),  na (II),

Na (I)=n(I)-Nc/2 and  Nc on U, taken after 14 hours’ long rest of MPD-2 in vacuum, after

obtaining the results presented in Fig.7. In this case also na (I)=na (II), but both, na (I) and

na (II)  are  twice  as  smaller,  and  Nc  has  dropped  dramatically,  i.e.  each  group  of  anode

wires, after putting the detector  at rest, has  acquired spatial sensitivity. Fig.9 shows the

time-stability function of, e.g., na (I) (crosses), Na (I) (squares) and Nc (triangles) during 5

hours of continuous operation, measured after obtaining the results presented in Fig.8.

So, the investigations show, that there is indeed observed a significant change in the

porous layer’s characteristics on passage of a certain time after deposition of porous CsI

layer, irrespective whether MPD is operated or turned off.

These  results  show,  that  the  detection  efficiency  of  MPD-2  drops  (Fig.5)  due  to

increasing of the working voltage in the course of time, as a result of which the plateau

shifts to the right with a low h  at the previous values of U.  Increasing of U is conditioned

by  the  formation  of  microcrystals  and  a  polycrystalline  structure  in  the  course  of  time

13

(Fig.3),  resulting  in  compaction  of  the  porous  layer,  shortening  of  the  free  path  of

electrons,  and  strengthening  of  the  electric  field  necessary  for  the  acceleration  of

electrons to energies high enough for initiation of avalanches. The transverse size of these

avalanches also decreases, improving the detector’s spatial resolution.

Note, that in the first hours of operation, when MPD-2 was spatially insensitive, the

curves of na (I)=ƒ(U) and na (II)=ƒ(U) are showing a well-expressed plateau (Fig.4). And

when MPD-2 resumed spatial sensitivity, the plateaus on these curves become narrower

(crosses  and  points)  (Fig.6).  This  is  because  in  the  first  case  each  anode  wire  is

registering  a -particles  having  hit  mainly  its  sensitive  area  and  some  number  of  a -

particles having hit the sensitive area of the neighboring wire (Nc„ 0). The probability of

registering  particles  having  hit  the  neighboring  anode  wire  increases  with  U  (Fig.6,

triangles),  that  is  why  none  of  the  curves  can  have  a  plateau.  But  the  analogous

dependences of the number of a -particles having hit the sensitive area of only one group

of anode wires, Na (I) and Na (II) reaches a plateau. This is well seen in Fig.6, where the

dependence of Na (I) on U is labeled by squares.  This is understandable, because now a -

particles having hit the sensitive area of the neighboring wire are discarded.

MPD-2 was operated 10 hours a day followed by a 14 hours' rest during 16 days,

after which it was disassembled. Every day, the obtained data were practically the same

as  the  results  obtained  on  the  second  day  (Fig.8),  i.e.  the  detector's  properties  did  not

change after its getting stabilized.

The time-stability function of this detector having operated at U=1350V for 16 days

is shown in Fig.10. Plotted along the abscissa are the days and along the ordinate – the

average  number  of  Na (I)  (squares)  and  Nc  (triangles)  per  diem.  During  this  series  of

14

measurements MPD-2 had been put at rest on the 4th day for 38 hours, and on the 11th day

for  60  hours.  It  also  follows  from  these  results,  that  the  substantially  long  absence  of

exposure  to  radiation  as  well  as  the  supply  voltage  do  not  affect  the  stability  of  MPD

operation.

Similar  investigations  have  been  carried  out  also  with  MPDs  with  anode  wires

spaced at b=0.125mm and b=0.75mm. In case of b=0.125mm, the results were analogous

to those mentioned above, and Nc on the next day was equal to » 6% of the total number

of  detected  a -particles  at  a  detection  efficiency  of  0.9,  i.e.  the  MPD’s  coordinate

resolution  was  much  better  than  – 60m m.    In  case  of  b=750m m,  Nc  was  approximately

65% from the very beginning, while on the second day it was » 0.2%.

There was also studied MPD-3 with an area of 5· 5cm2, the detector’s gap and the

spacing  between  the  anode  wires  being  0.5mm,  and  a  CsI  layer  with  H=0.7mm  and

r =0.4%. The measurements of the thickness of CsI layer over the whole area showed that

it is uniform within – 25m m. The number of incident a -particles was N0a =4320min-1. This

detector performed exactly like the previous ones. Fig.11 shows the results of the time-

stability measurements of the detection efficiency conducted for 48 hours of continuous

operation of MPD-3, beginning on the 3rd day after deposition of porous CsI layer. Fig.12

shows the results of the time-stability measurements conducted for 42 days of continuous

operation  of  the  same  detector.  In  the  latter  case,  the  detector  operated  8  hours  a  day,

being switched off for the rest of the day. The fact that the detection efficiency reached

95%  indicates  that  it  is  within  an  accuracy  of  5%  the  same  over  the  whole  area  of  the

detector.

Analogous  measurements  have  been  conducted  on  MPD-4  designed  for  X-ray

detection  with  a  porous  CsI  layer  with  H=1.3– 0.05mm,  b=0.5mm  and  r » 0.4%  after

deposition. The intensity of X-rays was 74s–1, and the registration threshold Vthr=35 mV.

The results of measurements show, that, again, as in the former cases, in the beginning

MPD-4  is  spatially  insensitive,  and  the  detection  efficiency  sharply  decreases  in  the

course of time. These results are shown in Fig.13 and Fig.14.

In  Fig.13  are  presented  the  dependence  of  nx(I)  (crosses),  nx(II)  (points)  and  Nc

(triangles) on U. Fig.14 shows the time-stability function of MPD-4 obtained in one hour

after the measurements shown in Fig.13.

The  dependence  of  nx(I)  (crosses),  nx(II)  (points),  Nc  (triangles),  and  Nx(I)=nx(I)–

Nc/2 (squares) on U measured after 16 hours'  rest of MPD-4 and the time-stability data

DUH(cid:3)SUHVHQWHG(cid:3)LQ(cid:3))LJ(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:24)(cid:3)DQG(cid:3))LJ(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:25)(cid:15)(cid:3)UHVSHFWLYHO\(cid:17)(cid:3)2QH(cid:3)FDQ(cid:3)VHH(cid:15)(cid:3)WKDW(cid:3)ZIWHU(cid:3)WDNLQJ(cid:3)UHVW(cid:15)(cid:3)DV(cid:3)LQ

case  of  a -particles,  MPD-4  acquires  spatial  sensitivity,  time  stability,  and  the  working

voltage increases. But, as distinct from the case with a -particles, the plateau on the curve

of  Nx(II)=ƒ(U)  lost  former  clearness,  and  h   dropped  a  little  faster  (30%  in  4  hours,

Fig.16) than in case of a -particles. The investigations showed, that decrease of h  slowed

down day by day, and on the 11th day it was 10% for 8 hours, h  having been dropping

mainly during the first 2 hours, as was the case with a -particles.

However, as distinct from the case with a -particles, the X-ray detection efficiency,

h x,  measured  in  one  hour  after  deposition  of  CsI,  was  substantially  lower  than  h x

measured  after  the rest  period, as in the  latter  case  the  number  of  X-quanta  detected  in

each group of anode wires did not decrease as it did in case of a -particles, but increased.

Apparently this is due to the fact, that the particle detection efficiency is a function of the

16

ionizing power of particles. As far as in the beginning of operation the particle detection

efficiency  drops  in  the  course  of  time  (Fig.5  and  Fig.14),  it  could  be  supposed  that  it

keeps dropping also when measuring na (I) and na (II) as a function of U, forming a 'false'

plateau. The ionizing power of a -particles is so high that electron loss due to decreasing

efficiency of electrons’ drift and multiplication does not substantially affect h a . As for X-

rays,  their  ionizing  power  is  ~500  times  lower  than  that  of  a -particles,  so  that  the

decrease  of  the  number  of  drifting  electrons  notably  decreases  h x.  After  rest,  the

performance of MPD-4 is stable, that is why nx(I) and nx(II) do not decrease as a function

of U, and there is no ‘false’ plateau.

The  measurements  by  MPD-4  lasted  29  days.  Sixteen  days  the  detector  was

registering X-rays, 15 days of which the detector  was turned off after having operated for

8-9 hours every day. On the 16th and 17th days the measurements were conducted round

the clock, i.e. continuously, then the measurements were conducted in the previous mode

for the rest of the time.

Fig.17  shows  the  time-stability  function  of  MPD-4  measured  at  U=1550V  on  the

16th  and  17th  days  for  one  of  the  anode  wire  groups,  e.g.,  second  group,  Nx(II)=nx(II)–

Nc/2. The last four values of Nx(II) were obtained at higher U (U=1580V). Although the

ionizing  power  of  X-rays  is  ~500  times  higher  than  that  of  a -particles,  however,  as  in

case of a -particles, the detector shows good time stability, and the slight decrease of h  is

controllable.

To  study  the  performance  stability  of  MPD-4,  on  the  18th  day  after  finishing  the

time-stability measurements, we once again measured the dependence of Nx(II) and Nc on

U  (Fig.18).  It  is  seen  in  Fig.18,  that  the  working  characteristics  of  MPD  have  not

17

practically changed as compared with the second day (Fig.15), the maximum efficiency

of X-ray detection being 65%. The X-ray measurements continued for another day with

h

  remaining  the  same.  Then  the  measurements  continued  for  11  days,  detecting  a -
o

particles. The detector performed stable with h a =100%.

It  should  be  noted,  that  every  day,  in  the  beginning  of  the  measurements,  the

number of coincidence pulses from two groups of anode wires was higher than at the end

of the measurements, which means, that the MPDs’ coordinate resolution was improving

with the operation time.

So, MPDs perform stable at registering a -particles as well as X-rays with » 6KeV

energy and have a high spatial resolution.

In  all  the  cases,  in  between  the  measurements  the  detectors  were  exposed  to

radiation and a voltage was applied over them.

On completion of the series of these measurements, all MPDs were disassembled,

revealing  no  changes  in  the  porous  CsI  layer,  i.e.  the  detectors  could  have  been  still

operable.

6.  Discussion

Unfortunately,  the  experimental  investigations  in  this  case  are  going  ahead  of  the

theory and there is no possibility to conduct experiments based on theory predictions as

was  the  case  with,  e.g.,  X-ray  transition  radiation  detectors  [30,31]* .  However,  even

qualitative representations show, that the reason for the absence of spatial sensitivity and

18

stability  of  MPD  performance  at  the  beginning  is  the  high  density  of  bulk  and  surface

defects  in  the  porous  medium.  The  increase  of  porous  layer’s  density  in  the  course  of

time is obviously accompanied by a decrease in the number of these defects, so that the

probability  of  capturing  charge-carriers  decreases,  and,  correspondingly,  the  space  and

surface  charges  also  decrease.  So,  MPDs  get  stabilized  and  acquire  higher  spatial

sensitivity. The latter is affected also by the shortening of the transverse size of electron

avalanche.

 It should be noted that it is possible to obtain better results by using CsI of higher

purity, ensuring cleanliness of the technological procedures of fabrication of the whole of

the detectors, and taking of certain measures, as, e.g., increasing the number of acceptors

and coating the pore walls by Cs and oxygen.

7.  Conclusions

The  results  of  the  investigations  testify  to  the  fact  that  the  MPD  characteristics

strongly change on passage of some time after deposition of porous CsI layer. The results

of  the  investigations  testify  to  the  fact  that  the  MPD  characteristics  strongly  change  on

passage  of  some  time  after  deposition  of  porous  CsI  layer.  We  presume  that  in  freshly

prepared CsI layers deposited by thermal  evaporation, in the  course  of  time  there  takes

place spontaneous formation of microcrystals and a polycrystalline structure. This results

in  decreasing  of  the  density  of  charge-carrier-capturing  centers  which  slows  down  the

                                                                                                                                                                            
 As was shown in [32], X-ray transition radiation was not detected in earlier works
[33,34].

formation of space and surface charges, and the MPDs get stabilized and acquire spatial

sensitivity.

So, multiwire porous detectors, conserving their spatial sensitivity, are maintaining

a long-term stability of performance, and the insignificant drop of the particle detection

efficiency can be corrected by adjusting the supply voltage.

It is also obvious, that the experimental data are insufficient for a final quantitative

interpretation of the discovered effects.

The  obtained  results  are  basic,  and  besides  their  practical  significance,  they  will

stimulate the development of  the  theory  of  electrons’  drift  and  multiplication  in  porous

dielectrics under the action of a strong electric field and ionizing radiation, will broaden

and deepen the knowledge on solids, and open new perspectives for using dielectrics in

such fields of engineering that are non-traditional for using dielectrics.

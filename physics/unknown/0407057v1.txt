Abstract 

The dipole mode synchrotron frequency is a basic beam parameter; it and a few similarly  

basic  quantities  measured  at  small  time  intervals  serve  to  characterize  the  longitudinal 

beam dynamics throughout the acceleration cycle.  The effective accelerating voltage, in 

conjunction with the amount of rf voltage required for the acceleration, is important for 

the estimate of the beam energy loss per turn.  The dipole mode frequency can be used to 

obtain the effective accelerating rf voltage, providing that it can be measured precisely.  

The  synchrotron  frequency  measured  from  the synchrotron phase detector signal (SPD) 

generally  agrees  well  with  calculation,  and  it  can  be  applied  for  such  purposes  as 

inferring the effective rf voltage. 

Introduction 

It is important to have more than one method for estimating the effective rf voltage in the 

Booster.  First, the effective accelerating rf voltage (V×sin(φs)) can be obtained from the 

direct  measurements  of  the  accelerating  rf  voltage  (V)  and  the  synchronous  phase  (φs).  

Secondly, it can be calculated using eq. (1) from the synchrotron frequency (fs) measured 

by the SPD[1]:

Here h is the harmonic number of the rf frequency, 84 in the Booster.  f0 is the revolution 

frequency, η0 is the phase slip factor, β is the Lorentz’s relativistic factor, and E is the 

total energy.[2] 

The agreement between the calculated and the measured synchrotron frequency becomes 

important for deciding whether or not the measured synchrotron frequency from the SPD 

signal can be trusted in estimating the effective accelerating rf voltage.

Experimental Result 

The  signal  to  noise  ratio  from  the  SPD  is  improved  by  connecting  its  output  through  a 

low-pass  filter  with  a  cutoff  frequency  of  40  KHz  because  the  bandwidth  of  the  SPD 

passes much other information besides the phase of the rf fundamental component of the 

beam  current.    The  synchrotron  frequency  was  measured  at  1  ms  intervals  through  the 

period  of  injection  (0  ms)  to  transition  (17  ms)  for  the  extracted  beam  intensity  of 

4.3×1012 protons.  The synchrotron frequency was obtained from the modulation on the 

SPD signal, as shown in Figs. 1(a) – 1(d) for the examples of 0 ms, 1 ms, 10 ms and 15 

ms.  The  synchrotron  frequency  measured  from  the  SPD  signal  is  shown  as  the  black 

curve in Fig. 2. 

Calculation of Synchrotron Frequency  

The effective rf voltage (RFSUM) and the synchronous phase were measured on separate 

cycles  with  similar  extracted  beam  intensity  of  4.3×1012  protons.    RFSUM  is  shown  as 

the blue curve and the synchronous phase is shown as the black curve in Fig. 3(a).  The 

Lorentz relativistic factor (β), the phase slip factor (η0), the revolution frequency (f0), and 

the total energy (E) of a proton change during the acceleration in a Booster cycle.  β is 

shown  as  the  black  curve  and η0  is  shown  as  the  blue  curve  in  Fig.  3(b)  for  a  Booster 

cycle, and f0 is shown as the black curve and E is shown as the blue curve in Fig. 3(c).  

Thus, all the parameters required by eq. (1) for the synchrotron frequency calculation are 

known; the results are shown as the red curve in Fig. 2(a). 

Conclusion 

The synchrotron frequency was obtained in the period of injection to transition both by 

direct  measurement  from  the  SPD  signal  and  by  calculation  using  eq.  (1).    The 

measurement  agrees  with  the  calculation  well  except  during  the  first  two  ms  after 

injection.  Thus the synchrotron frequency can be applied for the estimate of the effective 

accelerating  rf  voltage  in  conjunction  with  the  direct  RFSUM  and  synchronous  phase 

measurements.    The  discrepancies  between  the  measurement  and  the  calculation  at  the 

first two ms after injection need further investigation, but macroparticle modeling agrees 

more closely with the measurements, and is shown as the green curve in Fig. 2.  Also, the 

synchrotron frequency measurement after transition needs more effort because the dipole 

mode signal is swamped by the excitation of bunch length oscillation at transition.

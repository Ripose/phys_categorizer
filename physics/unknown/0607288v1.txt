Abstract.  We  consider  two  non-longitudinal  Doppler  Effect  experiments.  The  first  one 
involves  a  stationary  source  of  monochromatic  light  located  at  the  origin  O  of  the 
K(XOY) inertial reference frame and an observer R who performs the hyperbolic motion 
at a constant altitude. The second involves a stationary observer located at the origin O 
and a monochromatic source of light that performs the hyperbolic motion. In both cases 
we  compare  the  relationship  between  emission  and  reception  times  of  the  same  light 
signal and the relationship between the emission and the reception time intervals of two 
successive light signals.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
In a previous paper [1] we have studied the following three scenarios: 
stationary receiver and accelerating source of light, stationary source of light 
and  accelerating  receiver  and  stationary  source  of  acoustic  waves  and 
accelerating observer. In all cases the motion is the well known hyperbolic 
one  [2]  that  takes  place  along  the  line  that  joins  source  and  receiver.  The 
purpose of the present paper is to extend the problem to the non-longitudinal 
case  when  the  velocity  and  the  instantaneous  position  vector  make  a  time 
dependent angle. The problem was studied by Neutze and Moreau [3] who 
take into account the fact that  a moving observer is not able to measure the 
time interval between the reception of two successive wave-crests from the 
same  point  in  space  (not  instantaneous  measurement).  They  consider  only 
the  case  when  the  moving  observer  receives  the  first  wave-crest  at  a  zero 
time  when  his  speed  is  equal  to  zero,  receiving  the  second  one  being  in 
motion. The purpose of our paper is to generalize the results of Neutze and 
Moreau  [3]  considering  all  the  successive  time  intervals  measured  by  the 
moving observer.  
 
We propose the following scenarios: 

1.  Stationary  source  of  light  S  located  at  the  origin  O  of  the  inertial 
reference  frame  K(XOY)  and  an  accelerating  receiver  moving  at 
constant altitude y =h.

2.  Accelerating  source  of  light  moving  at  constant  altitude  y  =h  and  a 
stationary  receiver  located  at  the  origin  O  of  the  K(XOY)  inertial 
reference frame. 

In  these  scenarios  the  accelerating  motion  along  the  OX  axis  is

where g represents the constant acceleration of the moving object (source or 
receiver) with respect to its instantaneously commoving inertial frame, t and 
t′  are  the  readings  of  a  stationary  clock  C  and  respectively  of  a  clock  C′ 
commoving with the accelerating object when they are located at the same 
point in space. In the right side equations we use the notation

various terms. Here T may be interpreted as a “magic” time interval required

When  represented  in  world  coordinates  [t,  x/c]  the  equations  (1)  and  (2) 
correspond 
the  parametric  equations  of  a  conjugate  hyperbola. 
Accordingly this motion is also known as the “hyperbolic motion”. It begins 
at  x  =  +∞,  t  =  −∞  with  V  =  c  when  the  decelerating  object  approaches  the 
origin with proper acceleration −g until it reaches the rest at t = 0 and x = 0. 
Thereafter for t > 0 the moving object reverse direction receding the origin 
with  proper  acceleration  +g  and  reaching  V  =  c  as  x(cid:5)  +∞,  t  (cid:5)  +∞  in 
accordance with the requirements of special relativity.  
The  invariance  of  distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of 
relative motion requires that 
 
 
2. Stationary source of light and accelerating receiver 
 
 
For keeping the equations as simple as possible we consider that the 
light signal emitted by the source S at t = te will be received at t = tr by the 
observer located at the point R(xr,h).

mathematical solutions of (6) for T = Th = 1 and for different values of the 
emission time.

Subsequently  we  investigate  which  solution  is  physically  valid  under

point  W(xw,t)  representing  the  intersection  between  the  circular  wave-front 
of the propagating light signal and the receiver trajectory.

Equation  (8)  describes  a  hyperbola  while  equation  (10)  reveals  a  supra-
luminal  speed  for  the  virtual  point  of  intersection.  This  result  doesn’t 
disregard  special  relativity  because  no  transport  of  energy  (information) 
takes place in the direction in which the observer moves.  We illustrate both 
functions in Figure 4.

The resulted supra-luminal speed of the wave-front point W suggests that we 
may have at most one superposition between this point and the accelerated 
receiver, therefore at most one reception time and not two as mathematically 
given by (7). Further conclusions result after depicting the world line of the 
accelerating  receiver  (WLR)  and  the  word  line  of  the  W  point  (WLW)  in  a 
common world diagram.

Figure 5. The world diagram for different emission times  

 
Figure 5 depicts three emission-receptions events. If te ≤ T then we have an 
unique reception time, which is 0 for te = -h/c and +∞ for te = T. For te > T 
the communication between source and receiver isn’t possible anymore. It is 
remarkable to notice here that the last emission time for which a reception is 
still possible doesn’t depend on the receiver altitude but it depends only on 
receiver acceleration g and the speed of light, having the same value as for h 
= 0, which is the longitudinal Doppler scenario that we analysed in [1]. 
 
Now  that  we  identified  the  physically  valid  solution  of  equation  (6)  which

between  them.  This  allows  us  to  introduce  the  concept  of  Doppler  factor 
defined as the quotient between the proper reception and the proper emission 
periods as:

Figure  7  shows  the  variation  of  D  with  the  order  number  N  and  different 
eT . Figure 8 illustrates the variation of the Doppler factor D with 
values of 
the emission order N and the influence of Th = h/c. 
 
Figure 7 and 8 show that for a constant emission period the received period 
increases until the receiver is at rest (local maximum), but thereafter we have 
a  time  window  in  which  the  received  period  decreases  before  increasing 
again (local minimum). For negative emission times we have D <1 i.e. the 
proper reception period is lower than the proper emission period, whilst for 
positive  emission  times  we  have  D  >1,  thus  the  proper  reception  period  is 
larger than the proper emission period. It is also amazing to notice in figure

7  that  we  have  a  region  of  inverted  monotony  wherein  for  the  same  order 
number N the reception period becomes longer as the emission period goes 
shorter.

Figure 8. The variation of Doppler factor D with the emission order N  
for T = 1, Te = 10-3 and different values of Th = h/c 

 
We  notice  in  figure  8  that  for  very  early  emission  times  (when  the 
approaching receiver is far away from source) or just before the interruption 
of communication with the receding receiver (when te (cid:5) T) the influence of

h/c diminishes and all curves approach the one-dimensional case with h = 0 
(longitudinal  Doppler  Effect).  In-between  these  regions  h/c  achieves  a 
stronger influence with the receive period reaching a local maximum whose 
peak  value  is  independent  on  the  receiver  altitude  h  being  equal  to  the 
emission period Te. This maximum occurs in a region where the relativistic 
effects  may  be  ignored,  more  exactly  when  the  receiver  is  at  rest,  which 

means that

Furthermore we notice in figures 7 and 8 a further interesting aspect of this 
scenario,  namely  that  for  h  ≠ 0  we  have  two  situations  when  the  reception 
period  T′r  equals  the  emission  period  Te.  The  first  one  occurs  with  the 
observer  at  rest  receiving  the  signals  emitted  at  te  =  −Th  =  −h/c  and  the 
second one occurs with a receding observer receiving the signals emitted at 
te = 0 when the observer was at rest. More surprising in between these two 
time  instances  we  notice  a  region  in  which  D  <  1.  Thus,  contrary  to 
longitudinal  Doppler,  the  proper  receive  period  may  be  shorter  than  the 
proper emission period also during the receding phase. 
 
 
3. Stationary receiver and accelerating source of light 
For keeping the equations as simple as possible we consider that the 
 
light  signal  emitted  by  the  accelerating  source  S  at  t  =  te  and  at  the  point 
S(xe,h) will be received at time t = tr by the stationary observer located at the 
origin O.

Figure 13. The variation of reception time with the emission time for T = 1 
 
We notice in figure 13 that for very early or very late emission times (when 
the source is far away from receiver) the influence of h/c diminishes and all 
curves approach the one-dimensional case with h = 0 (longitudinal Doppler 
Effect).  If  the  distance  source-receiver  is  relatively small then h/c achieves 
more significance.

Supposing  now  that  the  accelerating  source  emits  periodic  light  signals  at 
 then the stationary observer receives the Nth 
periodic time instants 
light  signal  when  his  wrist  watch  reads 
.  Using  (17’)  we  calculate  the 
successive  reception  instants  measured  by  R  as  well  as  the  time  interval 
between them. This allows us to calculate the Doppler factor D as:

Figure 15. The variation of Doppler factor D with the emission order N for

In  figure  14  and  15  we  observe  the  same  oscillatory  behaviour  of  the 
reception  period,  occurring  for  h  ≠  0  and  creating  two  points  when  the 
proper  reception  period  Tr  equals  the  proper  emission  period  T′e.  The  first 
one  occurs  with  the  source  at  rest  separating the approaching and receding 
phases  and  the  second  one  occurs  with  the  source  approaching  the  rest 
position.  These  points  delimit  a  local  maximum  region.  Moreover,  we  find 
that  in  this  region  we  have  D  >1.  Thus,  contrary  to  longitudinal  Doppler 
effect,  the  proper  receive  period  may  be  longer  than  the  proper  emission 
period also during the approaching phase. 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
We reveal some new and interesting aspects related to the behaviour 
 
of the time interval between the reception of two successive light signals as 
measured by an accelerating observer when emitted by a stationary source of 
light  and  of  the  time  interval  between  two  successive  light  signals  as 
measured by a stationary observer when emitted by an accelerating source of 
light. In both cases the accelerated motion is the hyperbolic one and it takes 
place at a constant altitude. Our approach teaches how to put in equations a 
given physical scenario. We also present an innovative method allowing to 
choose the valid physical solution among multiple mathematically solutions 
derived  by  formulas.  In  what  is  concerning  the  range  of  contact  between 

 

13

source and receiver we found striking similarities between the scenarios we 
analyse here and the longitudinal Doppler effect we analysed earlier [1].

ABSTRACT 

Author presents mathematical model for acting-on-a-distance attractive and repulsive 

forces based on propagation of energy waves that produces Newton expression for 

gravitational and Coulomb expression for electrostatic forces. Model uses mathematical 

observation that difference between two inverse exponential functions of the distance 

asymptotically converges to function proportional to reciprocal of distance squared. 

Keywords: Gravitational Force; Electrostatic Force; Field Theory

Introduction 

Author described his Dual Time-Space Model of Wave Propagation in work [2]. 

He tries to express physical phenomena based only on concept of energy. 

Model asserts that when at some point in space and in time local energy value is 

different from global energy level in surrounding area, energy disturbance is created at 

this point. Energy disturbance propagates both in time and in space as energy wave, and 

oscillates. Author used the model to describe both propagation of energy waves in physics 

[3] – [5] and fluctuations of demand and supply in economics [6], [7]. 

Author presented in [3] mathematical model for attractive and repulsive forces 

that demonstrated how gravitational and electrostatic forces are created on a distance 

based on instrument of Dual Time-Space Model of Wave Propagation. However paper [3] 

didn’t explain one important point. It described forces acting on a distance as being 

proportional to inverse exponential function of distance. Lately author realized that 

difference between two inverse exponential functions of distance is asymptotically 

converging to function that is proportional to reciprocal of distance squared. Thus result 

provided by the model is in agreement with experimentally obtained formulas for forces 

acting on a distance such as gravitational and electrostatic forces. 

In current paper author presents quantitative mathematical model for acting-on-a-

distance static forces.

2.  Model Methodology 

As it was described in [2], each point in space and in time is characterized by two 

energy values – local energy value in point 

 and global energy level in neighboring

area 

(
tx,Φ

)

. The difference between quantities 

(
txU ,

)

 and 

(
tx,Φ

)

 creates energy 

disturbance, which propagates both in time and in space according to ordinary differential 

equations presented below.

One of primary characteristics of current model is that it uses three variables to 

describe dynamics of wave propagation. Nonetheless present paper is devoted to static

phenomena, particularly to formation of static forces acting on a distance between solid 

bodies. Dynamics of wave propagation in space will involve a special study.

Transformation of Global Energy Level near Solid Body 

Author considers in current paper the static situation 

t ≡

. It means that energy 

0t

disturbance is not propagated in time. Here we deal with solid bodies – it means from the 

model’s point of view that energy disturbance is not propagated in space with regard to 

local energy values 

txU , )
(

. Thus we only consider transformation of global energy level 

)tx,Φ
(

. 

Mathematically speaking, static situation means that equations (1) – (3) have null 

coefficients 

νµλ
t

,

,

=t

t

0

. Solid body means null coefficient 

0=xµ

 in equations (5) – 

(7) (other coefficients in equations (5) – (7) are nonnegative 

,
x νλ

≥x

). Therefore 

equations (5) and (7) can be combined into the following one,

λν
x
x

(
Φ

(

txUtx
,
,
−

)

(

)
)

 

 

 

 

 

 

(9) 

Since we are dealing with solid body, local energy value 

(
txU ,

)

 can’t propagate 

behind body’s boundaries 

ℜ∈0x

. 

The situation is illustrated on Figure 1, which shows transformation of energy 

level in space near boundary of solid body. 

Figure 1a shows situation when no energy disturbance is present and local energy 

values in space match global energy level in surrounding area. Figure 1b displays 

situation on the boundary of solid body where local energy value abruptly changes its 

6 

magnitude. That change creates energy disturbance, which transforms global energy level 

behind the boundaries of solid body. 

To calculate transformation of global energy level one has to solve equation (9) 

for 

x >
1

x

0

. We have following initial conditions at the body’s boundary 

ℜ∈0x

 for 

0>∀t

x >

 and 

0>∀t

, and equation (9) 

for global energy level 

 can produce following equation for energy disturbance

Forces near Solid Body at Rest 

As we know, concept of physical forces is related with ideas of work and distance, 

and particularly – multiplication of average force applied to body by distance equals to 

the work, where work equals to change of body’s energy. 

Following to discussion above, when a solid body has energy disturbance, it 

creates energy disbalance in surrounding area. If energy disbalance occurs on the 

boundary of solid body, the body is trying to move to another position in order to reduce 

this energy disbalance. Thus energy disturbance creates physical force. The magnitude of 

that force is proportional to changes of absolute value of energy disturbance with respect 

to distance in space. Force points to direction of decrease of absolute value of energy 

disturbance. Next definition of force is used in the model.

boundary of solid body

where 

0>k

 is coefficient of proportionality. 

Let’s look how this definition of force works for solid body that is placed at rest. 

The situation with solid body at rest is illustrated on Figure 2. 

Figure 2a displays local energy values 

 and global energy level

(

 near solid 

body, which takes into account transformation of global energy level on each side of the 

solid body’s border (this correction of global energy level is not further used in the 

paper). 

Thus if points in space 

ℜ∈0x

 and 

ℜ∈2x

, where 

x >
0

x

, are respectively right 

and left boundaries of solid body, transformation of global energy level

Forces around Two Solid Bodies 

In this section we study impact of energy disturbance on the boundaries of one 

solid body that affects energy disturbance on the boundaries of another solid body (as 

displayed on Figure 3). We consider three points in space 

ℜ∈0x

, 

ℜ∈1x

, and 

ℜ∈3x

 

where 

x

. Here 

0x

 is right boundary of first solid body, 

1x

 and 

3x

 are left and 

right boundaries respectively of second solid body (see Figure 3a). 

If we denote as 

2U

 – local energy value for second body and as 

=′∆

2 UUU

 –

jump of energy value on the boundaries of second body, then reverse forces, which hold 

second body at rest, are as before,

When we consider resultant energy disturbance near second body, we have to 

consider not only transformation of global energy level to the left of point 

1x

 – left 

boundary of second body and to the right of point 

 – right boundary of second body but 

3x

transformation of global energy level to the right of point 

 – right boundary of first 

0x

body as well. Dual effect of transformations of global energy level near second body is 

reflected by subtracting from global energy level transformed by boundaries of second 

body 

1x

 and 

3x

 the global energy level transformed by right boundary 

0x

 of first body. 

We may say that we adjust global energy level near solid body by subtracting from it the 

impact induced by other solid bodies in surrounding area.

(

 to resultant energy disturbance 

ˆ

)

 at the boundaries of second body

 and

. We assume that energy disturbances

)

 in points 

1x

 and 

3x

 are 

decreased by energy disturbance

 are decreased by values

 respectively. It gives us resultant energy disturbances

(

 and 

ˆ
(

 acting on 

boundaries of second body. 

Discussion above can be summarized by following assertion. 

Assumption. Quantity of energy disturbance

We may look at equation (21) from a new point of view – energy disturbances at 

the boundaries of solid body are summed with energy disturbances propagated to these 

boundaries from reflected images of other solid bodies in vicinity (reflected image of 

solid body has energy disturbance of opposite sign). 

Figure 3d presents distribution of resultant energy disturbance 

ˆ
(
txE ,

)

 near the 

boundaries of second body in points 

1x

 and 

3x

, and shows forces 

ˆ
(
txF ,

)

 acting on 

second body in points 

1x

 and

. 

To calculate forces 

ˆ
(
txF
,
1

)

 and 

ˆ
(
txF
,
3

)

 in points 

1x

 and 

3x

 we denote as 

1U∆

 

and as 

3U∆

 – the absolute values of resultant energy disturbance 

ˆ
(
txE ,

)

 in points 

1x

 and 

3x

. Then forces acting on the second body in these points are,

As a result, by combining equations (29) and (31) we obtain next approximation 

for resultant force 

 acting on second body,

, and

. 

Thus we have established Inverse Square Law for resultant force 

ˆ
( )tF2

 acting on 

second body and given by equation (32). 

Let us extend formula for resultant force on two- and three-dimensional spaces. 

At first we refer to observation that resultant force acting on solid body is 

obtained by summarizing all forces acting on that body. 

Assumption. Resultant force acting on a solid body is equal to sum of all forces 

acting on the body, 

tFˆ
( )

( )∑≡
i tF

 

i

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(33) 

Secondly, if we move from one-dimensional space that was considered so far to 

multi-dimensional spaces, we imagine plurality of lines starting perpendicularly to the 

surface of first solid body, and penetrating the surface of second solid body. One line 

produces forces on the boundaries of second body. Each resultant force is proportional to 

interval of the line that is contained between the boundaries of second body (as stated by 

equation (32)). To obtain total resultant force 

 acting on second body we have to 

ˆ
( )tF2

sum together all resultant forces acting at boundaries of the body. Total resultant force 

acting on second body is proportional to the sum of all such intervals that are located 

between the boundaries of second body. 

 

14 

Thirdly, when we consider solid bodies that are relatively departed from each 

other (i.e. 

R >>

r

 as stated above), the lines connecting two bodies are drawn in parallel 

to each other. Therefore for two-dimensional space sum of all parallel intervals that lie 

between boundaries of two-dimensional body equals to the body’s internal area. 

Respectively for three-dimensional space sum of all parallel intervals that lie between 

boundaries of three-dimensional body equals to the body’s internal volume. 

The discussion above is illustrated on Figure 4. 

Figure 4a shows forces, whose sum makes resultant 

 force acting on two-

ˆ
( )tF2

dimensional second body. Similarly Figure 4b demonstrates forces, whose sum creates 

resultant force 

 acting on three-dimensional second body. 

ˆ
( )tF2

Therefore in three-dimensional space resultant force 

 acting on second solid 

ˆ
( )tF2

body is expressed by following equation, 

ˆ
( )
tF

R

 is distance between first and second bodies, V  is second body’s internal 

volume, 

U∆

 is jump of energy value on the boundaries of first body, and 

0>k

 is 

coefficient of proportionality. 

Since indexing on first and second bodies can be interchanged, we obtain pair of 

expressions for absolute values of 

ˆ
( )tF1

 and 

ˆ
( )tF2

 – resultant forces acting on first and 

second bodies respectively,

At the same time, from Newton’s third law resultant forces 

ˆ

 acting 

on first and second bodies respectively should have the same absolute values, and point to

Electrostatic Forces 

To get Coulomb’s formula for electrostatic forces we consider two separate cases 

– electrostatic forces for repulsion and attraction. 

a) Repulsive Electrostatic Forces 

At first, I consider for diversity one-dimensional space with two solid bodies, each 

with negative jump of energy values

 and

Let’s examine absolute values of resultant energy disturbances 

1U∆

 and 

3U∆

 at 

the boundaries of second body in points 

1x

 and 

3x

 obtained in vicinity of first body, and 

presented by equations (25) and (26). 

Since values 

U∆

 and 

U ′∆

 are negative and of common order, it takes place

 i.e. force is 

directed to right way of second body, and second body is repulsed from first body. 

Secondly, according to equation (38) we have an estimate of the absolute value of 

resultant force between two three-dimensional bodies. To get formula for electrostatic 

forces we look at factor (

)

VU ⋅∆

 from equation (38). It represents electrostatic energy of 

solid body but that energy is traditionally expressed via electrostatic charge  Q . Therefore 

it follows the Coulomb’s formula from equation (38) for repulsive force between two 

solid bodies that both have negative electrostatic charges

 is 

distance between first and second bodies, and

Figure 5 illustrates repulsive forces between two solid bodies where each body 

has a negative electrostatic charge. 

b) Attractive Electrostatic Forces 

At first, I consider here one-dimensional space with two solid bodies where first 

body has negative jump of energy value 

=∆

UUU

−

1

0

 and second body has positive 

jump of energy value 

=′∆

UUU

, and jumps of energy values have magnitudes 

of common order. 

Let’s look again at absolute values of resultant energy disturbances 

1U∆

 and 

3U∆

 

at the boundaries of second body in points 

1x

 and 

3x

 obtained in vicinity of first body, 

and presented by equations (25) and (26). 

Since value 

U∆

 is negative and value 

U ′∆

 is positive and both are of common 

order, it takes place

 i.e. force is

According to equation (38) we have an estimate of the absolute value of resultant 

force between two three-dimensional bodies. It is represented by the same formula (42). 

Figure 6 illustrates attractive forces between two solid bodies where first body 

has a negative electrostatic charge, and second body has a positive electrostatic charge. 

7.  Gravitational Forces 

This section is devoted to Newton’s formula for gravitational forces. We consider 

two solid bodies where first solid body produces energy disturbance that is much bigger 

than energy disturbance produced by another solid body. We look at two different cases – 

situation with rotation of small body around its axis and situation with tidally locked 

small body (i.e. without rotation of small body around axis). 

a) Gravitational Force with Tidally Locked Attraction 

At first, I consider two solid bodies in one-dimensional space with positive jumps 

of energy values 

=∆

UUU
0

−

1

>

0

 and 

=′∆

UUU

−

2

1

>

0

, when jump of energy value 

for first body is much bigger than jump of energy value for second body i.e. 

∆

U

′∆>>
U

. 

Let’s examine the absolute values of resultant energy disturbances 

1U∆

 and 

3U∆

 

at the boundaries of second body in points 

1x

 and 

3x

 obtained in vicinity of first body, 

and presented by equations (25) and (26). 

 

 

19 

Since values 

U∆

 and 

U ′∆

 are both positive and 

∆

U

′∆>>
U

, it takes place 

'
∆≤∆

 resultant force 

ˆ

ˆ
(

) 0
<

 i.e. force is 

pointed to the left way of second body, and second small body is attracted to first massive 

body. 

If we examine results of equations (46) and (47) we see that absolute values 

1U∆

 

and 

3U∆

 are in reality the propagated energy disturbances 

1−

(
,1
txE

)

 and 

1−

(

)

 of 

reflected image of massive solid body 

 revealed at the boundaries of small body, 

( U∆−

)

and summed with energy disturbances of small body 

(
,1
txE

2

)

 and 

(
,3
txE

3

)

. Thus we 

may say that gravitational force of attraction between massive body and small body is 

result of interaction of massive body with its reflected image (I suppose from symmetry 

that force, which attracts massive body to small body, is result of interaction of small 

body with its reflected image as well). 

Ultimately according to equation (38) we have an estimate of the absolute value of 

resultant force between two three-dimensional bodies. To get formula for gravitational 

 

20 

forces we examine factor 

(
VU ⋅∆

)

 from equation (38). It represents gravitational energy 

of solid body. I assume (this assumption is in agreement with general assertion that 

body’s energy is proportional to its mass) that energy value 

U∆

 of solid body is 

Merger of equations (38), (49) gives formula for resultant gravitational force 

proportional to its density

0>γ

where one body has much bigger jump of energy value than another body does. 

b) Gravitational Force with Rotation of Small Body 

Let us move small body away from massive body in right direction. Then at some 

moment we have next resultant energy disturbances at the boundaries of small body in

If we again move small body in right direction from points

(55) 

(56) 

(57) 

Therefore resultant energy disturbances at the boundaries of small body in points 

δ+′1x

 and 

δ+′3x

 have opposite signs. Contrary boundaries of small body are attracted 

to each other, and it generates slow rotation of small body. Since 

1 >ε

0

 and 

3 >ε

0

 are 

small, gravitational force still can be approximated by formula (51). 

When we move small body further away from massive body, contrary boundaries 

of small body become stronger attracted to each other and rotation of small body becomes 

faster. At the same time magnitude of gravitational force acting between small and 

massive bodies approaches and finally reaches zero. At that moment absolute values of 

resultant energy disturbances at the boundaries of small body in points 

1x ′′

3x ′′

At this position (when small body is in points 

1x ′′

 and 

3x ′′

) the resultant force 

( )tFˆ

 

between small and massive bodies becomes zero. 

When we move small body further away from points 

1x ′′

 and 

3x ′′

, rotation of small 

body becomes slow. Gravitational force acting between small and massive bodies 

changes its direction, and small and massive bodies start being repulsed from each other. 

Figure 8 illustrates situation with gravitational force between small and massive 

bodies at position when the force equals zero.

Conclusion 

Unfortunately model still doesn’t provide answers for all questions. For example, 

I am trying to understand process behind Newton’s third law for forces acting on a 

distance between two solid bodies.

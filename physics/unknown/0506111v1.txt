An  experimental  formula,  sometimes  named  as  Newton’s  collision-formula,    (v1-v2)  =  -  e.(u1-u2)    relating 
relative-velocities  before & after impact  of two bodies under linear-collision, is commonly used successfully for study 
of  collision-dynamics.  Although  it  seems  possible  as  shown  in  text-books  [1,2]  to  derive  this  relation,  assuming 
(defining)  ‘e’ as ratio of impulses during restitution & deformation;  but as yet,  neither a good theoretical-basis  nor    
a general-derivation of this formula based on obvious choice of energy-consideration, has been reported.  In this brief-
paper a relativistic-theoretical-basis is adopted and a general formula-derivation is given. It is shown, interestingly, that 
proof of the Newton’s collision-formula is hidden in Einstein’s-special-relativity. 
 
 
 

Consider two particles 1 & 2 moving in the same (+ive x) direction with initial velocities u1 & u2 
before impact  and that its velocities after the impact are v1 & v2 in the same directions;  such that relative-
velocity before-impact is ur  and that after-impact it is vr. Newton’s famous experimental collision-formula 
given in text-books [1,2] relates these with the equation  vr/ur = - e   or    (v1-v2)/(u1-u2) = - e  ,  where e is 
said to be coefficient of restitution ( normally,  0 < e < 1;  but for perfect-elastic-collision e = 1  and for 
perfect-plastic-collision  e  =  0).  The  relativistic  basis    and    a  novel  general  theoretical  derivation  of  this 
formula  based on energy-consideration   are described as follows. 

 
In an effort to derive this formula  a relativistic approach / basis is chosen. It may be noted that 
according to Einstein’s  ‘special theory of relativity’ [3]  conclusion  made by a  moving- observer in his-
frame of reference is same as the conclusion made by a laboratory-observer in the laboratory-frame. Now,  
imagine a mass-less observer  sitting on particle-2 (or  the particle-2 itself as an observer)  so that to him -   
particle-2 is at rest and particle-1 moves with a relative-velocity ur before-impact and with relative-velocity 
vr after-impact. Mass-energy (E = mc2) conservation before & after impact yields the following equation, 
using the relativistic  mass  m  =  mo/(1- v2/c2)½ ;  where  m1o  &  m2o are the rest-masses of  the two particles 
with-respect-to the moving observer,  c is velocity of light. 

 
 
m1o/(1- ur
 
 
This  equation  reduces  to  the  following  equation,  neglecting  higher-order-terms  (in  binomial-

2/c2)½ .c2 + m2o.c2  =  m1o/(1- vr

2/c2)½.c2 + m2o.c2 + losses

Since ur is the relative approaching velocity before-impact and that for-collision  the two particles 
approach  to  the  closest,  and  since  after-collision  these  have  to    separate  out;    +ive  sign  on  RHS  of  the 
equation-3  is omitted  and –ive sign is retained.  Taking (defining) e = (1-δ)½  ,  the Newton’s experimental 
collision-formula is  arrived at   as following (Eqs. 4 & 5).  It may be noted (from   e = (1-δ)½)   that   for 
perfect-elastic-collision with no energy loss δ = 0  hence e = 1,  and that for perfect-plastic-collision with 
full energy loss δ = 1  hence e = 0.

(v1 – v2) / (u1-u2) = - e  

vr / ur = - e = (1-δ)½     
 
Further, from Einstein’s relativistic velocity addition [3] it is known that ur = (u1-u2)/(1+u1.u2/c2)  
 
and  vr = (v1-v2)/(1+v1.v2/c2) which are approximately simplified   (as per Galilean relativity) as ur = (u1-u2) 
and vr = (v1-v2); hence the derived relation (Eq.4)  vr / ur = - e  gives the following commonly known/used 
Newton’s experimental collision- formula (Eq.5). 
 
 
 
 
Thus the novel theoretical relativistic derivation of Newton’s experimental formula for collision of 
two particles has been made, although using some approximations (between Eq.1 & Eq.2 and between Eq.4 
&  5))  ;  which  means  that  Newton’s  formula  is  not  exact    and  can  not  be  used  for  very  high-velocity-
collisions  (of  elementary  particles).    In  that  situation,  the  following    relativistic-velocity-added  modified 
formula  (Eq.6)  could  possibly  be  used    which  too,  however,  is  approximate    but  more  accurate  than  the 
Newton’s formula (Eq.5). 
 
 
 
 
Einstein’s  special-relativity. 
 
In  an  interesting  paper  [4]    it  is  shown  that  the  second-law-of-thermodynamics  and  the  special-
 
relativity  are  linked  together.    Thus  it  seems  that  differently-looking  entities  such  as    the  second-law-of-
thermodynamics (engine-efficiency η,  0 < η < 1 ), the special-relativity (velocity-ratio β,  0 < β < 1 ), and 
the collision-dynamics (restitution-coefficient e,  0 < e < 1 )  are in fact  not-so-different  but in a way   the 
different facets of the same coin.   Also,  it is well known [3] that special-relativity is the ‘bridge’ between 
electricity and magnetism.  In a recent fundamental paper [5] it is shown that once-again it is the special-
relativity  which is the ‘key’ for much-sought unification of  gravity  to  electromagnetic-force.

Linear and Nonlinear Absolute Phase Effects in Interactions of Ulrashort Laser Pulses 
with a Metal Nano-Layer or with a Thin Plasma Layer 
 
Author: Sándor Varró 
 
Abstract.  It  has  been  shown  that  in  the  scattered  radiation,  generated  by  an  ultrashort  laser 
pulse  impinging  on  a  metal  nano-layer,  non-oscillatory  wake-fields  appears  with  a  definite 
sign. The magnitude of these wake-fields is proportional with the incoming field strength, and 
the definite sign of them is governed by the cosine of the carrier-envelope phase difference of 
the incoming pulse. When we let such a wake-field excite the electrons of a secondary target 
(say an electron beam, a metal surface or a gas jet), we can obtain 100 percent modulation in 
the electron signal in a given direction. This scheeme can serve as a basis for the construction 
of a robust linear carrier-envelope phase difference meter. At relativistic laser intensities the 
target  is  considered  as  a  plasma  layer  in  vacuum  produced  from  a  thin  foil  by  a  pre-pulse, 
which  is  followed  by  the  main  high-intensity laser pulse.  The nonlinearities stemming from 
the  relativistic  kinematics  lead  to  the  appearance  of  higher-order  harmonics  in  the  scattered 
spectra. In general, the harmonic peaks are down-shifted due to the presence of an intensity-
dependent factor. This phenomenon is analogous to the famous intensity-dependent frequency 
shift in the nonlinear Thomson scattering on a single electron. In our analysis an attention has 
also been paid to the role of the carrier-envelope phase difference of the incoming few-cycle 
laser pulse. It is also shown that the spectrum has a long tail where the heights of the peaks 
vary  practically  within  one  order  of  magnitude  forming  a  quasi-continuum.  By  Fourier 
synthesising the components from this plateau  region, attosecond pulses have been obtained.  
 
Key  words:  few-cycle  laser  pulses,  carrier-envelope  phase  difference,  high-harmonic 
generation, relativistic laser-plasma interactions.

1. Introduction 
 
The study of the interaction of intense few-cycle laser pulses with matter has brought a new, 
important  branch  of  investigations  in  nonlinear  optics,  as  Brabec  and  Krausz  (2000) 
emphasized in their review paper. The effect of the absolute phase (the carrier-envelope phase 
difference, in short: “absolute phase” or “CE phase”) on the nonlinear response of atoms and 
of  solids  interacting  with  a  very  short,  few-cycle  strong  laser  pulse  has  recently  drawn 
considerable  attention  and  has  initiated  a  wide-spreading  theoretical  and  experimental 
research. For instance Paulus et al. (2001) have detected an anticorrelation in the shot-to-shot 
analysis  of  the  photoelectron  yield  of  ionization  measured  by  two  opposing  detectors.  This 
effect  comes  from  the  random  variation  of  the  CE  phase  (hence  the  direction  and  the 
magnitude of the electric field of the laser) from one pulse to the other. Such extreme short 
pulses can be used to monitor the details of photoelectron dynamics (Hentschel et al., 2001) 
or  atomic  inner-shell  relaxation  processes,  like  the  Auger  effect  (Drescher  et  al.,  2002). 
Concerning theory, the CE pase-dependence of the spatial asymmetry in photoionization has 
been  investigated  by  Chelkowski  and  Bandrauk  (2002),  and  by  Milošević  et  al.  (2002)  (see 
also Milošević et al., 2003). In the meantime the problem of the stabilization and control of 
the CE phase in the few-cycle laser pulse trains has been achieved by Baltuška et al. (2003) 
and  by  Witte  et  al.  (2004).  On  the  basis  of  a  simulation,  using  the  time-dependent  density 
functional  approach,  Lemell  et  al.  (2003)  predicted  the  CE  phase-dependence  of  the 
photoelectron yield in case of the surface photoelectric effect of metals in the optical tunnel 
regime. Apolonskiy et al. (2004) and Dombi et. al. (2004) have reported the measurement of 
this  effect,  but  the  absolut  phase-dependence  had  a  considerably  smaller  modulation  (CE 
phase-sensitivity)  in  their  experiment  than  predicted  by  the  simulation.  Fortier  et  al.  (2004) 
has  recently  demonstrated  the  CE  phase  effect  in  quantum  interference  of  injected 
photocurrents in semiconductors. In the multiphoton regime Nakajima and Watanabe (2006) 
has found theoretically CE phase effects in the bound state population of a Cs atom excited by 
nearly single-cycle pulses.  

At  this  point  we  would  like  to  note  that  there  is  a  wide-spread  opinion  among 
researchers  investigating  the  CE  phase  effects  that  these  effects  appear  exclusively  in 
nonlinear processes. In fact, as Fearn and Lamb, Jr. (1991) have shown already in 1991, the 
sine or the cosine character of the laser pulse makes a difference in the linear photoionization 
dynamics, if one takes into account the counter-rotating term in the interaction. As they wrote 
in  Section  IV.  of  their  paper:  “This  suggests  that…the  time  delay  [of  the  electron  signal] 
could be used to measure the phase of the field.” A simple illustration of the linear CE phase 
effect has recently been considered by Ristow (2004) in the case of a harmonic oscillator. 

At  relativistic  incoming  laser  intensities  the  high-harmonic  production  on  plasma 
surfaces has been considered analytically by Lichters et al. (1996) on the basis of their famous 
oscillating mirror model. The model introduced in the present paper considerably differs from 
this  approach,  because  we  have  exactly  taken  into  account  the  radiation  reaction  on  the 
plasma  layer.  We  note  that  recently  there  has  been  much  labour  put  into  the  classical 
simulations  of  various  processes  (generation  of  coherent  x-rays,  laser  acceleration  of 
electrons) in laser-plasma interaction (see e.g.  Pukhov & Meyer-ter-Vehn, 2003, Kiselev et 
al., 2004 and Quèrè  et al., 2006). Moreover, the first experimental results by Hidding et al. 
(2006)  appeared  on  the  generation  of  quasi-monoenergetic  electron  bunches  by  strong  laser 
fields.  On  the  other  hand,  to  our  knowledge,  there  have  been  no  classical  relativistic 
considerations  so  far  published,  where  the  CE  phase  effect  in  the  relativistic  regime  would 
have  been  analysed.  The  present  paper  may  be  considered  as  a  contribution  to  the  study  of 
this particular aspect, too.

We  have  seen  above,  that  in  the  theoretical  works  exclusively  nonlinear  quantum 
processes  (photoionization,  surface  photoelectric  effect)  have  been  considered  in  the 
nonrelativistic regime.  In  the  present paper we describe the reflection and  transmission of a 
few-cycle laser pulse on a thin metal layer and a plasma layer represented by a surface current 
density  of  free  electrons.  Our  analysis  here,  as  in  our  earlier  study  (Varró,  2004),  is  based 
completely on classical electrodynamics and mechanics, in the frame of which we solve the 
system of coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations of the incoming and scattered radiation and the 
surface current representing the metallic or plasma electrons.  

In  Section  2  we  present  the  basic  equations  describing  our  model,  and  present  the 
exact analytic solution of the scattering problem in the nonrelativistic regime. Here we shall 
briefly  analyse  the  exact  solutions  in  the  frequency  domain.  We  shall  discuss  the  temporal 
behaviour of the reflected signal, and show that a pulse-decompression and “freezing-in” of 
the radiation field may happen, yielding to the appearance of a quasi-static wake-field in the 
scattered signal. In Section 3 we shall derive the relativistic equation of motion for the surface 
current density of the electrons which are considered the active charges in a thin plasma layer. 
It  will  turn  out  that  the  complete  solution  of  the  scattering  problem  can  be  reduced  to  the 
solution  of  a  first  order  ordinary  inhomogeneous  differential  equation.  An  approximate 
analytic  solution  to  this  equation  will  be  given,  which  is  valid  for  moderately  relativistic 
incoming  laser  intensities.  On  the  basis  of  these  solutions  the  spectrum  of  the  reflected 
radiation  field  containing  higher-harmonics  will  be  calculated.  It  will  be  shown  that  these 
spectra  are  considerably  depend  on  the  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  of  the  incoming 
few-cycle laser pulse. In Section 4 a brief summary closes our paper. 

 

2. The appearance of wake-fields in the scattered signal in the non-relativistic regime 
 
The idea to study system under discussion appeared to us by reading a paper by Sommerfeld 
(1915)  in  which  he  analysed  the  temporal  distortion  of  x-ray  pulses  of  arbitrary  shape  and 
duration impinging perpendicularly on a surface current being in vacuum. In our earlier work 
(Varró,  2004)  we  have  generalized  this  model  in  the  following  sense.  On  one  hand,  we 
allowed oblique incidence of the incoming radiation field, and on the other hand, we assume 
that the surface current distribution (which represents a thin metal layer) is embedded between 
two semi-infinite dielectrics with two different indeces of refraction. In the present paper we 
shall give the relativistic generalization of the equation of motion of the surface current, too, 
which  was  not  investigated  by  Sommerfeld,  either.  This  latter  approach  will  be  derived  in 
Section  3,  where  we  shall  consider  the  interaction  of  a  plasma  layer  with  laser  pulses  of 
relativistic  intensities.  In  the  present  Section  we  shall  consider  only  the  non-relativistic 
dynamics of the surface current. 
 
2.1  The  basic  equations  of  the  model  and  the  exact  analytic  solutions  in  the  frequency 
domain 
The  model  to  be  used  here  we  have  already  studied  in  our  earlier  work  (Varró,  2004).  For 
completeness  of  the  present  paper,  let  us  first  briefly  summarize  the  basic  notations  and 
equations, which can also be found in this reference. We take the coordinate system such that 
the first dielectric with index of refraction  1n  fills the region 
, this  is called region 1.

fact is assumed to be represented by a sheet of electrons bound to region 2 and moving freely

in the x-y plane. In case of perpendicular incidence the light would come from the positive z-
direction, and it would be transmitted in the negative z-direction into region 3. The plane of 
incidence is defined as the y-z plane and the initial  kr -vector is assumed to make an angle  1θ  
with the z-axis. In case of an s-polarized incoming TE wave the components of the electric 
field and the magnetic induction read

of  Eq.  (13)  gives  at  the  same  time  the  complete  solution  of  the  scattering  problem.  We  see 
that the equation of motion for the local displacement 
 contains a damping term  with a 

′δ
)(ty

damping  parameter  Γb   where  Γ   has  been  defined  in  Eq.  (10).  This  latter  constant  is 
proportional with the squared plasma frequency and the thickness of the electron layer. The 
appearance of the damping term is a manifestation of the radiation reaction coming formally 
from  the  boudary  conditions  in  the  present  description.  Since  Γ   is  proportional  with  the 
electron density, this effect is due to the collective response of the electrons to the action of 
the complete (not only the incoming) radiation field, which, on the other had reacts back to 
the  electrons.  In  the  present  description  it  is  not  possible  to  divide  into  steps  these 
“consecutive” effects, as in the usual treatments of the radiation back-reaction. Eq. (13) can be 
. By calculating the Fourier transforms of 
solved exactly for an arbitrary incoming field 
Eqs.  (11),  (12)  and  (13)  we  can  give  an  exact  solution  of  the  scattering  problem  in  the

phase. This means that as we vary the CE phase between 0 and  π, the modulation depth is 
given by Eq. (21). It is clear that if  τω0  is very large (which is the case of many-cycle pulses), 
then  the  modulation  function  is  practically  zero.  On  the  other  hand,  when  τω0   is  not  large 
(which is the case of few-cycle pulses), then for small frequencies (
) we can have a 
modulation close to 100%. From Eqs. (15), (16) and (21) one obtains that the modulation of 
both  the  reflected  and  the  transmitted  signal  is  given  by 
  at  a  particular 
frequency.  On  the  other  hand  neither  of  the  reflection  coefficient  nor  the  transmission 
coefficient  depend  on  the  CE  phase  in  the  linear  regime.  It  is  clear  that  if  the  response 
function contains a resonance at a small frequency (
), then there is a better chance to 
observe the mentioned linear CE-phase-dependence at that particular resonance frequency.

At  this  point  let  us  note  that  Eqs.  (15)  and  (16)  are  more  general  than  the  original 
relations, Eqs. (11), (12) and (13), written in the time domain, where the indeces of refractions 
3n   have  been  taken  as  mere  constants.  The  optional  dispersion  can  be  taken  into 
1n   and 
account in Eqs. (15) and (16) by putting by hand a frequency dependence into  1n  and 
3n . In 
the  present  paper  we  are  not  dealing  with  this  aspect  of  the  problem.  Our  description  is 
approximate  to  the  real  scattering  process  in  an  other  respect,  too,  namely  it  relies  on  the 
plane-wave  model  of  the  incoming,  reflected  and  the  refracted  field.  This  is  a  standard 

Sándor Varró: Linear and Nonlinear Absolute Phase Effects

approximation  which  is  used  in  the  texbooks  throughout.  Equations  (15)  and  (16)  can  be 
superimposed  for  an  assembly  of  incoming  plane  waves  of  different  propagation  direction, 
and  this  description  would  be  suitable  to  handle  the  scattering  of  a  beam  with  a  limited 
transverse extension. In the present paper we are not dealing with this aspect of the scattering 
problem, either. Thus, our results are suitable to describe the scattering of unfocused beams. 
 
2. 2 The appearance of frozen-in wake-fields in the scattered signal 
As one sees from Eqs. (15) and (16) both the reflected and the refracted Fourier components 
have a pole at

Before  entering  into  some  numerical  examples  of  the  temporal  behaviour  of  the 
scattered field, let us make some general remarks. It is clear that if the pulse duration of the

incoming  field 
exponential  factor,  then 
  cuts  off  a  small  region  in  the  inegration  interval  in  Eq.  (22) 
because  of  the  relative  smoothness  of  the  exponential  function.  This  means  that  the  upper 
limit of the integral can be extended up to infinity within a reasonable approximation. Hence 
the  asympthotic  behaviour  of  the  velocity 
  can  certainly  be  well  represented  by  the

In the numerical expressions in Eq. (24d)  I  denotes the mean intensity of the pulse measured 
in W/cm2, 
phE  is the mean photon energy in eV-s, and  λ denotes the central wavelength of 
the  pulse  measured  in  microns  (we  have  not  displayed  the  numerical  prefactors  of  order 
unity).  According  to  Eq.  (24c),  the  polarization  current  and  (due  to  Eq.  (11))  the  scattered 
field  itself  contains  a  wake-field  which  is  a  frozen-in  non-oscillatory  quasi-static  field 
 after leaving the metal layer. The decay time

of this wake-field is given by 
, which can be much larger than an optical period, as is 
κπb
shown  on  Fig.  1,  where  we  have  taken 
.  Since  we  are  dealing  just  with  few-cycle 
incoming  pulses,  this  means,  that  the  wake-field  is  still  present,  after  the  main  pulse  has 
passed.  Moreover,  from  Eq.  (23a)  it  can  be  seen,  that  at  the  Brewster  angle  of  incidence 
(
)  only  the  wake-field  is  propagating  in  that  particular 
c

direction. It is remarkable, that, as can be seen from Eqs. (24b-c),  the amplitude of the wake-
field is proportional with the cosine of the CE phase ϕ. Thus, for instance, by varying the CE 
phase,  the  sign  of  the  quasi-static  wake-field  can  be  reversed.  On  Fig.  2  an  illustrative 
example  is  shown  for  the  temporal  behavior  of  the  reflected  signal  at  Brewster  angle  of 
incidence of an incoming one-cycle Ti:Sa laser pulse.

Thus, for an incoming laser of intensity 
field in the reflected signal is of oder of 50000 V/cm, which is quite a large value for a quasi-
static  field.  As  we  have  already  mentioned  above  the  amplitude  and  sign  of  this  wake-field 
can be varied by changing the CE phase of the incoming pulse. The idea naturally emerges, 
that  when  we  let  such  a  wake-field  excite  the  electrons  of  a  secondary  target    –    say  an 
electron beam, a second metal plate or a gas jet  –   we may obtain 100 percent modulation 
depth in the electron signal (acceleration, tunnel-ionization) in a given direction, even for a 
relatively  low  intensity  incoming  field.  This  scheeme  can  perhaps  serve  as  a  basis  for  the 
construction  of  a  robust  linear  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  meter.  At  the  end  of  the 
present section we would like to emphasize that the generation of the wake-fields discussed 
above is a linear process, since the amplitude of the wake-field is simply proportional with the 
amplitude of the incoming field. This means that for the observation of the effect considered 
here one does not need extremely high laser intensities. 
 
3. High-harmonic generation on a plasma layer in the relativistic regime 
 
In the present Section we shall first derive the relativistic equation of motion of the surface 
current density of the electrons which are considered the active charges in a thin plasma layer. 
It  will  turn  out  that  the  complete  solution  of  the  scattering  problem  can  be  reduced  to  the 
solution  of  a  first  order  ordinary  inhomogeneous  differential  equation.  We  shall  give  an 
approximate analytic solution to this equation valid for moderately relativistic incoming laser 
intensities (where 
1<µ ). On the basis of these solutions we shall calculate the spectrum of the 
reflected radiation field.

where  the  heights  of  the  peaks  vary  practically 
within  one  order  of  magnitude  in  the  frequency 
range considered. 
 
The presence of the plateau shown on Fig. 5 suggests that by Fourier synthesis of this part of 
the spectrum results in the appearance of attosecond pulses, as was first proposed by Farkas 
and Tóth (1992). Note that the spacing of the individual peaks in the plateau region is much 
smaller than the central frequency, thus this plateau is almost a quasi-continuum.The result of 
the Fourier syntheses is shown on Fig. 6, where we see a part of an attosecond pulse train in 
the reflected signal. The width of the individual pulses are about on tenth of the optical cycle 
of  the  incoming  laser  pulse,  i.e.  they  have  a  duration  of  about  250  attoseconds.  Of  course, 
when we synthetise the Fourier components from a wider frequency window, we receive even 
shorter individual pulses. 
 
4. Summary 
 
In  the  present  paper  we  have  described  the  reflection  and  transmission  of  a  few-cycle  laser 
pulse on a thin metal layer and a plasma layer represented by a surface current density of free 
electrons.  Our  analysis  here,  as  in  our  earlier  study  (Varró,  2004),  is  based  completely  on 
classical  electrodynamics  and  mechanics,  in  the  frame  of  which  we  solve  the  system  of 
coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations of the incoming and scattered radiation and the surface 
current. In the first case the target can be produced, for instance, by evaporating an aluminum 
layer on a glass plate. In the second case we can thick of a plasma layer generated from a thin 
foil in vacuum by a pre-pulse which is followed by the main high-intensity laser pulse. 

In  Section  2  we  presented  the  basic  equations  describing  our  model,  and  gave  the 
exact analytic solution of the scattering problem in the nonrelativistic regime. Here we have 
briefly  analysed  the  exact  solutions  in  the  frequency  domain.  In  discussing  the  temporal 
behaviour  of  the  reflected  signal,  we  found  a  pulse-decompression  and  “freezing-in”  of  the 
radiation field, yielding to the appearance of a quasi-static wake-field in the scattered signal.

The  characteristic  time  of  these  wake-fields  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  squared  plasma 
frequency and the thickness of the electron layer. This characteristic time can be much larger 
than the central period of the incoming laser pulse, hence, it can be much larger then the pulse 
duration  of  the  original  few-cycle  pulse.  In  the  numerical  example  we  have  taken,  the 
amplitude of the frozen-in wake-field in the reflected signal is of oder of 50000 V/cm, which 
is quite a large value for a quasi-static field. The amplitude and sign of these wake-fields can 
be varied by changing the CE phase of the incoming  pulse.  We  have  pointed out that these 
wake-fields  can  perhaps  serve  as  a  basis  for  the  construction  of  a  robust  linear  carrier-
envelope phase difference meter.  

In  Section  3  we  derived  the  relativistic  equation  of  motion  for  the  surface  current 
density  of  the  electrons  which  are  considered  the  active  charges  in  a  thin  plasma  layer.  It 
turned out that the complete solution of the scattering problem can be reduced to the solution 
of  a  first  order  ordinary  (nonlinear)  inhomogeneous  differential  equation.  An  approximate 
analytic  solution  to  this  equation  has  been  given,  which  is  valid  for  moderately  relativistic 
incoming  laser  intensities.  On  the  basis  of  these  solutions  the  spectrum  of  the  reflected 
radiation  field  containing  higher-harmonics  have  been  calculated,  and  we  have  seen  some 
illustrative  numerical  examples  summarized  on  the  figures  3-6.  A  main  characteristics  of 
these  spectra  is  the  intensity-dependent  frequency  down-shift  of  the  harmonic  peaks.  This 
effect is an analogon of the well-known intensity dependent frequency shift in the nonlinear 
Thomson scattering on a single electron. For longer pulse we have found a sharp cut-off in the 
harmonic  spectra,  whose  position  can  well  be  estimated  from  the  theory  of  synchrotron 
radiation. It has also been shown that the spectra considerably depend on the CE phase of the 
incoming  few-cycle  laser  pulse.  In  certain  regions  of  the  reflected  spectra  we  have  found 
about  twenty  percent  of  modulation  (visibility)  by  varying  the  carrier  envelope  phase 
difference. In general, the high-harmonic spectra have a plateau, and the Fourier components 
of this quasi-continuum are locked in phase. As a consequence, by synthesing this part of the 
spectrum  we  have  obtained  attosecond  pulses  in  the  reflected  signal.The  widths  of  the 
individual  pulses,  coming  from  a  frequency  window  taken  in  our  numerical  example,  were 
about on tenth of the optical cycle.

In this paper, through a criticism of what we call the paradigmatic view of thermodynamics, we
aim  at showing a  new perspective attained  in this matter. The generalization of heat as  internal
energy  (generalization  of  the  kinetic  energy  concept  of  heat)  permits  the  generalization  of  the
Kelvin postulate: "It is impossible, without another effect, to convert internal energy into work"
(no reference to heat or to heat reservoir).

The conceptual foundations of thermodynamics present subtle and interesting difficulties.
The  conceptual  works of  Caratheodory  [1]  and  Callendar  [2]  are  good  examples  of  that  at  the
beginning of the XX century. A more recent work defines the generalized view that has survived
to  this  day  the  well  known  book  of  E.  Fermi,  Thermodynamics  [3].  We  call    that    view    the
paradigmatic   view    of  thermodynamics.  In  this  paper  the  method  to  introduce  and  explain  the
approach proposed is related to the above mentioned book in so far as its fundamental concepts
are  criticized  and  the  book  can  therefore  be  regarded  as  a  paradigm,  although  with  some
peculiarities.  However  we  are  not  going  to  criticize  especially  E.  Fermi's  book  but  the
paradigmatic physical approach of the middle XX century.  In the text we refer to Fermi's book
as (F.p.x), giving the number of the page x. This has the obvious advantage of making it easier to
pass from that view to the new approach proposed, with simultaneous corroboration. The use of
a  well  known  book  with  physical  interpretations,  like  Fermi's,  permits  to  achieve  this  goal.  In
fact,  Fermi  sacrifices  the  logic  consistency  of  the  phenomenological  view  to  the  obvious
interpretation  emerging  from  the  kinetic  view.  In  fact  the  approach  proposed  in  this  article
results from the simple interpretation based on the kinetic view  used by Fermi. For an ideal gas
the  internal  energy  can  be  considered  only  kinetic.  But  if  the  ideal  gas  is  submited  to  a
gravitational  field  the  internal  energy  has  also  a  gravitational  potential  term.  However  the
interpretation  subsist  for  this  case  if  we  consider  the  internal  energy  and  not  only  the  kinetic
energy. The generalization for other cases it is obvious and gives the hint for the changes in the
phenomenological approach proposed.

In  point  1  it  is  questioned  if  thermodynamics  is  an  autonomous  physical  domain
supported by the heat concept. This is a fundamental question because between two equilibrium
points the existence or non existence of heat  is dependent on the concept of heat in association
with  the  concept of  System  as  the  ensemble  of  all  sub-systems[4].  In  fact  we  can  separate  the
energy  interaction  terms  into  a  work  term  (gravitational  potential  energy  change  or  equivalent

1

[5]-for  example  the  energy  of  a  piston,  kinetic  and  potential)  and  an  internal  energy  (Heat  I)
variation term (for example the energy of the atoms of a gas, kinetic and potential). The energy
exchange between two parts of the System, two sub-systems, may be classified as heat exchange
(Heat II) when one of those sub-systems is a heat reservoir (we consider a heat reservoir a large
mass  with  constant  volume  in  interaction  with  a  sub-system,  exchanging  heat  with  that  sub-
system (Fig. 1)). This heat (exchange) is not equivalent to the classification of the internal energy
term as heat (Heat I). We can  have an exchange between work and internal energy and we can
say that the internal energy of the System increases by a quantity equal to the work energy term -
the work is transformed into heat (Heat I). The heat exchange between two sub-systems (Heat II)
is not equal, of course, to the internal energy increase of each one of the sub-systems because of
the existence of the work term.

Fig. 1 The heat reservoir (HR) is sub-system 2. The
 other sub-system, 1, exchanges energy, exchanges
 heat with HR and exchanges energy, exchanges work
 with the piston.  The internal energy of the System is
 the internal energy of the two sub-systems U1+U2. If
 we consider the atmosphere as sub-system 2 we must
 be aware of the adiabatic piston controversy (see 2.3.4).

If we use the word heat as internal energy (Heat I) it is possible to generalize the ordinary
enunciation  of  the  "Second"  Principle  of  Thermodynamics  and  also  eliminate  the  essential
character apparently permitted by "the "First" Principle of Thermodynamics to the quantity heat,
dQ, formally introduced in the "First" Principle.

The use of the word heat has been  more recently (once again) proposed for the quantity
entropy  (Heat III) [2,  6].  If  we  use  the  word  heat  for  the  internal  energy  we  have  most  of  the
properties pointed out by H. Fuchs [6] with no need to affirm that we have a heat  increase  in a
free expansion of a gas and the word heat can obviously be used in the energetic sense emerging
from the fundamental work of Joule [7, 8].

Terminological conflicts are also in the origin of the mistake pointed out in 2 and called

2

the paradigmatic error of Thermodynamics. In 2.1 we begin by analyzing the confusion between
the concept of quasi-static transformation and reversible transformation.

In 2.2 we clarify the notion of work for a reversible transformation.
In  2.3  the  problems  analyzed  in  2.1  and  2.2  are  related  to  the  energy  conservation
principle and the concepts of heat - the meaning of the "First" Principle of  Thermodynamics  is
analyzed and three examples of the conceptual difficulties emerging from the paradigmatic view
are referred to at 2.3.1, 2.3.2 and 2.3.3.

In 2.3.1 the meanings of specific heats are related to the  Energy  Conservation  Principle

avoiding the paradigmatic error.

Since  the  concept  of  temperature  can  be  derived  from  energy  and  entropy  [9,  10]  and
related to the ideal gas [11, 12], it is possible to consider temperature a derived and not essential
concept and also eliminate the tautological association  between the  Kelvin  temperature  and  the
ideal gas absolute temperature. This is referred in 2.3.2.

In 2.3.3 we relate  the  notion  of  adiabatic  transformation  to the  entropy  variation  and  to

the "First" Principle.

In  2.3.4  we  deal  with  the  meanings  of  heat  and  propose  the  use  of  the  word  heat  as
internal energy. For a transformation in contact with a heat reservoir the heat exchange (Heat II)
corresponds  to  the  heat  variation  of  the  reservoir  (Heat  I).  The  essential  and  general  character
apparently  given  by  the  formal  expression  of  the  "First"  Principle  to  the  quantity  dQ  different
from  the  internal  energy,  is  eliminated.  In  fact  the  use  of  the  formal  expression  of  the  "First"
Principle  together  with  the  confusion  between  the  concept  quasi-static  transformation  and
reversible  transformation  originates  the  paradigmatic  error  analyzed  at  2.  and  leads  to  another
"subtle error" considered in another article and referred to in 2.3.

In  3.  a  new  perspective  is  acquired  for the  "Second"  Principle  from  the  internal  energy
conceptualization  of  heat  -  the  entropy  concept  can  be  derived  from  the  equilibrium  tendency
[13]  and  from  the  asymmetric  heat  variation  [14].  Instead  of  a  "1st"  and  a  "2nd"  Principle  we
propose an energy-entropy principle [14].

In 4. the energy-entropy principle is interpreted microscopically in a straightforward way.
In the text the words System and sub-system are used. The System is the ensemble of all
sub-systems that intervene at the transformation. To remark that we use the word system (as the
ensemble of all sub-systems and not as a sub-system) written with capital letter.  This being so,
the transformation is always adiabatic for the System.

1. What is Thermodynamics?

In the  introduction of  his  book Fermi tries to  define  the  thermodynamics  domain  as  the
domain of heat. Curiously and paradoxically, this introduction displays the ordinary criticism to
Carnot's  conceptualization  of  heat.  This  generalized  criticism  is  paradoxical  because  as  is  well
known and accepted, Carnot's work is the origin of the essential concept of thermodynamics - the
entropy concept (see Appendix).

As  we  will  see,  the  phenomenological  interpretation  of  heat  is  apparently  inconsistent
with  other  interpretations  (the  kinetic  energy  interpretation  [5]  or  the  generalization  of  it  -  the
internal energy interpretation proposed).

Although Fermi considers thermodynamics (F.p.15) a heat science, in this introduction he
says that thermodynamics  may  be considered a special  branch of  mechanics [13], the statistical

3

mechanics (F.p.IX).  Then  if  we  think  that thermodynamics  has  a  non  mechanical  concept,  like
heat,  as  Fermi  claims,  the  paradox  is  evident.  This  false  conflict  between  mechanics  and
thermodynamics,  if  accepted,  makes  thermodynamics  a  mysterious  physical  subject.  The
mystery, however, can be avoided.

2. The Paradigmatic Error

2.1 The  confusion  between  the  concept  of  quasi-static  transformation  and
reversible transformation

One of the basic concepts of thermodynamics is the concept of reversible transformation
as  a  transformation  with  intermediate  equilibrium  points  (F.p.4).  This  conceptualization  is  the
origin of what we call the paradigmatic error [15, 16]. One example is enough to characterize the
problem.  In  fact  if  we  idealize  a  free  expansion  of  a  gas  (the  System)  with  intermediate
equilibrium  points  [17],  it  is  impossible  to  make  the  gas,  the  System,  return  to  its  initial
condition. This being so, the transformation satisfies the equilibrium condition but nevertheless it
is impossible for the gas to return to the initial state - the transformation is irreversible. However,
if we consider another System composed of the gas and a thermal reservoir, we can  apparently
have a return to the initial state. After free expansion the gas  is compressed and  forced back to
the initial conditions. The energy introduced into the gas by the compression  is exchanged with
the heat reservoir, as long as the thermal reservoir is big enough to hide the impossibility for the
actual System (sub-system gas + sub-system reservoir) to return to the initial state. However only
in  the  limit  when  the  mass  of  the  reservoir  is  infinite  can  the  gas  return  to  the  initial  state  but
even  in  this  case  the  reservoir  itself  cannot,  because  the  energy  of  the  reservoir  is  altered.
Although the gas, after free expansion, has returned to its initial state due to the compression in
contact with the thermal reservoir, this reservoir retained the energy corresponding to the  work
done during the  compression.  The  reservoir  may  obviously  exchange  energy  with  another  sub-
system and return to its initial state. But the new System in contact with the reservoir will, also
obviously,  be  prevented  from  returning  to  its  initial  state,  unless  it  enters  into  contact  with
another subsystem. And so on and on.

For the System  (ensemble  of  all  sub-systems)  the  transformation  is  irreversible  because
the System will never be able to go back to its initial state. Because of what has been said, it  is
essential to distinguish  between the whole (System) and the parts (sub-systems). In the text the
word system is used in this global sense, not in the common, currently used sense, of sub-system
(the word System, with capital S, we repeat, has been used to call attention to this). Only  if the
exterior  force  is  equal  to  the  interior  force  and  does  a  work  [5,  18,  19]  (with  an  energetic
meaning)  permitting  the  return  to  the  initial  conditions  do  we  have,  of  course,  a  reversible
transformation (see 2.2).

To affirm the quasi-static condition is not enough to define the reversible condition.

2.2 The work expression for a reversible transformation

The  energy  conservation  principle  and  the  tendency  to  equilibrium  permits  to  write  the

expression (F. p.11)

W D=

U

)1(

where  W  is  the  work  (equivalent  to  the  rise  or  fall  of  a  weight)  [5,  20]  and  D U  is  the  System
internal energy change between two equilibrium points (Fermi used  for work the symbol L and
the sign convention is such that  L = -W).

For  a  reversible  transformation  we  can  write  dW=-pdV  where  dW  is  the  infinitesimal
work  and  p  and  dV  are  the  equilibrium  pressure  and  the  infinitesimal  volume  change.  In  this
case, and only in this case, can we write

where T is the Kelvin temperature and p and S are respectively the pressure and the entropy (see
3.).

For a reversible transformation the infinitesimal entropy change of the System is zero

If we have an infinitesimal irreversible change we have (4) with dS>0 (see 3.) ,

For an irreversible infinitesimal change the work is not equal to -pdV.
The paradigmatic error is to write dW=-p dV for all quasi-static transformations. Only for
the reversible transformations this is correct. Formally, of course, we can write dW=-pdV but if
we  insist  on  calling  this  expression  the  work  term  we  are  committing  what  we  call  the
paradigmatic error [l4, 15, 16, 21].

2.3 The "First" Principle of Thermodynamics

Fermi (F.p.4)  gives  to the  reversible  transformation  the  quasi-static  definition  (see  2.1).
Only for the reversible transformation, as we saw (2.2), is the work term expressed by dW=-pdV.

This  is  a  source  of  confusion  because  we  have  an  expression  and  an  operational  means  to
calculate by integration W, a term which does not generally correspond to the energetic work.

In  chapter  2  (F.p.11),  Fermi  says  that  the  "First"  Principle  is  essentially  the  energy
conservation principle  for  "thermodynamic  systems".  If  the  "First"  Principle  is  only  the  energy
conservation principle there is no problem. But this is not so if the "First" Principle introduces a
new  quantity  dQ.  In  fact  Fermi  begins  by  introducing  the  internal  energy  concept  for
"mechanical  ystems",  as  he  says  (F.p.13).  For  "mechanical  systems"  he  concludes  that  W=D U
and  he notes that the existence of energy  imposes that W (the  work term)  be  independent  from
the trajectory (F.p.12). But in two pages (F.p.l4) he says that this is not so because he affirms that
thermodynamics  belongs  to  a  non-mechanical  domain  characterized  by  the  heat  exchange  dQ
(F.p.14 and F.p.15). (The exact sense of the word system has been previously explained in order
to  avoid  such  classifications,  i.e.,  mechanical  and  thermodynamical.  In  this  way,  System
corresponds  to  vhat  Fermi  designates  as  "mechanical  system",  and  sub-system  to  what  he
designates as "thermodynamical system").

If  we  have  a  System  with  a  great  number  of  particles  we  can  have  a  tendency  to
equilibrium if we change the exterior conditions [l3]. Then we can write between wo equilibrium
points

Curiously enough Fermi (F.p.29) also uses the word heat in the sense of  internal energy
and this is the terminology proposed. In fact if we aim at analyzing with generality the means of
work generalizing the concepts acquired at simple "mechanical" situations, we have difficulties.
For  variable  mass  systems  the  force  conceptualization  as  f=dp/dt  and  the  formal  use  of  the
"First" Principle doesn't permit an universal interpretation of the quantities involved [22, 23, 24].
Also  for  sub-systems  in  interaction  through  a  movable  wall,  the  separation  of  the  energy
interaction and the use of the "First" Principle, have originated "subtle errors" [21, 25, 26]. We
shall therefore use quantity Q only in the sense of energy exchanged with a heat reservoir (Q=-
D Ue) [26]. If we want to continue with quantities with physical  meaning  we  have  to  be  careful
(see 2.3.4).

The  experimental  methods  to  determine  Cp  and  CV  are,  in  most  cases,  is  conceived  by
measuring a work term. This energy can also be measured with calorimetric methods and in this
case corresponds to an exchange dQ=-dUe. But here we emphasize that the measurements of Cp
and CV are made in physical conditions that are associated with energy measurement changes of
the exterior subsystem  (dUe) or  a  work term  dW.  For the  calorimetric  methods  these  quantities
must  be  associated  with  a  heat  exchange  under  such  conditions  the  heat  exchange  has  a  clear
physical meaning [26].

2.3.2 The concept of temperature derived from energy and entropy and the

ideal gas

If we introduce the temperature concept from energy and entropy we obtain

T

)17(

For an "ideal gas" Fermi introduces the energy dependence exclusively on temperature from a
non existent experiment. Correctly Fermi says (F.p.22) that the temperature change  is small  for
the Joule experiment and uses this condition to identify the Kelvin temperature T with the  ideal
gas absolute temperature (pV=N K A; A is the absolute temperature). This  is  referred  by  Fermi
(F.p.62), and can  be avoided, but here only the problem  is referred to (see the references about
the ideal gas in 2.3.3).

2.3.3 Adiabatic transformations

On page 25 Fermi affirms that an adiabatic transformation is a reversible transformation for a
thermally  isolated  system  (dQ=O).  But  if  we  are  not  careful  we  can  commit  the  paradigmatic
error. In fact, if we write

with dQ =0 (adiabatic condition - without heat exchange (Heat II)), and if we also write

The adiabatic condition dQ =0 only imposes dS =0 for a reversible transformation (note
that we are not saying that Fermi commits the error of affirming that an adiabatic transformation
is  equivalent  to  a  reversible  adiabatic  transformation,  because  here,  on  page  25,  Fermi  clearly
says that he uses the word adiabatic as reversible adiabatic).

Fermi (p.26) uses the equation pVk  imposing the  "reversible"  (quasi-static)  condition  on
the expansion of an atmospheric mass gas. He affirms the poor conductivity for the air but says
nothing  about  the    reversible  condition.  He  commits  the  paradigmatic  error  as  he  confuses
reversible with quasi-static.

An isentropic transformation (dS =0) for a gas with state equation p=a  u (a  is a constant
and  u  is  the  energy  density)  satisfies  the  equation  pV a   +  1  =  constant.  For  a  non-relativistic
monatomic  gas  a   =  2/3  (for  a  photon  gas  a  = 1/3  ).  For  normal  (p,  T)  condition  this  gas
approaches the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann behavior and satisfies pV=BT with B constant. We
have a classical ideal gas (the photon gas exists together with the classical gas, also satisfying an
equation pV=BT but B is not constant).
For  an  ideal  gas  (p= a   u)  [11,  12],  dS=0  implies  pV a   +  1  =  constant.  For  an  adiabatic
 
irreversible  transformation  at  constant  exterior  pressure  (equal  to  the  interior  final  pressure)
between two equilibrium points, the pressure and  volume  for the  initial  and  final  points  can  be
= constant with d ‡ a +1. If the final pressure p2 is not to different from
fitted by an equation pV
the initial pressure p1  (p2 @   p1), then  d @ a +1.  Nevertheless  the  paradigmatic  error  is  committed
d  for the two points and not pV a
for the reason that the equation for the irreversible equation is pV
+  1  =  constant  for  all  the  points  (dS  =  0).  Although  for  the  reason  previously  stated,  i.e.,  the
proximity of points 1 and 2, d  value is approximately a +1.

2.3.4. Two meanings of Heat

On pg. 29, 31 and 56 Fermi uses the word heat in a different sense from that he carefully
defines on pg. 17 without explicitly making the difference between these senses. He continues to
use  the  word  heat  only.  This  can  be  a  source  of  confusion.  In  fact  on  pg.  56  Fermi  explicitly
affirms the production of heat by friction ("since the heat comes from work and not from another
part of  the  system...'').  The  origin  of  this  mistake  is  the  fluid-like  conceptualization  of  heat.  If
water    passes  from  one  reservoir  to  another,  the  properties  in  the  passage  are  still  those
associated with water and the mass of water is also conserved but if, for instance, the water runs
a mill, the energy is not conserved. Even for a fluid there are properties  that cannot be conserved
- see Appendix). The "heat exchange" (Heat II) between two subsystems is not equivalent to the
sub-systems  heat  variation  -  the  energetic  conceptualization  of  heat  doesn't  permit  a  fluid-like
character  for  heat.  In  this  sense  we  must  avoid  the  terminology  heat  exchange  in  the  sense  of
indestructible substance with intrinsic attributes as H20 has. However we can use the expression
in the sense of' energy exchange between two subsystems in special conditions.

This  being  so,  we  propose  the  following  nomenclature.  The  word  heat  is  used  as
synonymous with  internal energy.  We can only  have equality  for the energy exchange between
two sub-systems and the internal energy change of the sub-systems if there is no work. But as we
had  seen,  when  there  exists  work  we  can  identify  dQ  with  -dUe.  Then,  also  in  that  situation
(contact with a  heat  reservoir),  we  can  think  in  terms  of  internal  energy  change  of  the  exterior
sub-system (the heat reservoir). This being so, we can say that we have "heat exchange" (Heat II)

9

when  we  are  describing  an  energetic  exchange  between  sub-systems  and  one  of  these  sub-
systems is a "source of heat", and heat variation (Heat 1 variation) when we refer to the internal
energy  variation.  The  heat  variation  of  the  heat  reservoir  is  equal  to  the  heat  exchange  (with
minus sign). The Heat 1 variation of the heat reservoir is equal in module to Heat II.

A  rigorous  and  general  description  of  the  dynamical  energy  change  is  attained  by  the
momentum-energy  conservation  principle  but  in  special  situations  we  can  use  with  physical
meaning the expressions dW=dU+dUe =dU-dQ and use the word heat in the  sense  I  and  II  (in
the sense of internal energy of the "system" and  in the sense of  internal energy  variation of the
heat  reservoir).  This  physical  interpretation  led  us  to  the  energy-entropy  principle  considered
below.

3. The energy-entropy principle - the generalization of Kelvin postulate

Fermi  (F.p.30)  gives  one  of  the  traditional  enunciations  of  the  "Second"  principle  of

thermodynamics. The Kelvin enunciation:

"It is  impossible, without another effect, to convert heat extracted from a  heat  reservoir  into

work".

Fermi (F.p.29) says that work can be transformed into heat but the reciprocal is not true.
When  he  explains  that  "a  body  can  always  be  heated  by  friction  receiving  a  quantity  of  heat
(Heat I  variation)  equalizing  the  work  done,  he  is  clearly  using  the  word  heat  with  a  different
meaning from that he had previously and carefully constructed (F.p.17) and (F.p.56). He uses the
word heat with meaning I, in the sense of internal energy.

Although  Fermi  is  not  consistent  with  the  previous  definition  of  heat  the  physical
interpretation  is  obvious  if  we  introduce  a  clear  terminology.  Indeed  we  can  generalize  the
Kelvin enunciation affirming that it is impossible to transform internal energy into work without
other effects (no reference to heat or heat reservoir). The Kelvin enuntiation  is a particular case
of the new one.

As an example, consider a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston in a gravitational field.
It  is  possible  to  transform  the  internal  energy  of  the  gas  (Heat  I)  into  work  by  increasing  the
volume. But if the volume returns to the initial value, then the internal energy is bigger or equal
to the initial value (the equal value corresponds, of course, to the reversible transformation). For
the same volume there is work transformed into heat not the contrary. As a consequence of this,
the internal energy cannot be only a function of volume. Therefore we can introduce the entropy
variable U=U(V,S) and  obtain eq. (3) and (4) [9, 10, 14].

It is interesting to note that if we have a hypothetical source of "movable cylinder-piston
gas  apparatus"  (if  the  "evolution"  has  .originated  such  things...)  then  we  can  lift  weights  (we
assume, of course, that the natural initial condition of the gas inside the cylinder has a pressure
bigger than the atmospheric pressure) and with these weights at a higher level we can construct
a hot source (if the weights are stopped at a lower level and the kinetic energy is transformed in
microscopic  energy,  heat)  which  is  continually  renewed  by  the  "movable  cylinder-piston-gas
apparatus"  (this  is  analogous  to the  burn  of  a  fossil  combustible).  Or  with  this  apparatus  it  is
possible  to  obtain  electrical  energy  (for  example)  using  directly  the  potential  energy  of  the
weights, without constructing a heat reservoir (as we do in an  internal  combustion engine). In
this sense it is not true that two heat reservoirs are necessary to produce work [27, 28] because

10

initially we have only one temperature. For that we must use the "combustible".

Therefore for a system we must conclude the following:

Beginning  with  only  one  temperature  a  transformation  of  internal  energy  into  work  is
impossible without other alterations (obviously different of internal energy variation, or derived
quantities). We can say that only transformations  with  increasing  entropy  are  possible.  We  can
transform  heat  into  work  for  processes  with  an  increase  of  entropy  (for  a  heat  reservoir  it  is
impossible  to  transform  the  reservoir  internal  energy  into  work  without  other  effects  and  this
being  so,  beginning  with  only  one  temperature,  a  transformation  with  increasing  entropy  is
necessary to have a global positive work). It should be noted that the previous statements cause
energy  to  be  a  function  of  volume  and  of  entropy  [10,  14].  And  since  there  can  only  be
transformation of work into internal energy for the same volume, entropy variation should  have
only one sign (the positive sign was chosen). Therefore it is clear that a Carnot cycle (reversible)
with global zero entropy variation does not contradict the previous affirmation because we must
have  an  irreversible  process  to  "renew"  the  hot  reservoir.  But  in  a  more  restrictive  way,  if  the
heat  reservoir  is  not  compensated  and  exist  naturally  (for  instance  a  geothermal  hot  reservoir)
we can say that only processes without negative entropy variation are possible.

This corresponds to what we propose to call the energy-entropy principle:

The internal energy is a function of entropy satisfying the following relation:

The entropy variation  has two terms.  A  term  associated  with  the  volume,  (p/T)  dV,  and
the  term  dU/T.  (The  microscopic  interpretation  considers  these  two  terms  in  phase  space  (see
point 4.)).

4. The microscopic interpretation of the "second" principle

Fermi,  on  pg.  56,  curiously  enough  since  he  constructs  the  entropy  change  associated
with  the  expression  dS=dQ/T  (only  true  for  a  reversible  transformation,  but  as  "reversible"  is
confused with "quasi-static" this expression is erroneously applied also to an irreversible quasi-
static transformation), says that when a body is heated by friction it receives a positive quantity
of  heat  and,  because  heat  results  from  work  and  not  from  another  part  of  the  "system"  (sub-
system), the increase of entropy is not compensated by the decrease of entropy of the other part.
The explanation is this one if we use heat in the sense of the microscopic energy, the energy of
atoms and radiation, the internal energy. But Fermi has defined heat with the other meaning, the
meaning  emerging  from  the  "First"  Principle.  Without  another  explanation  this  is  a  source  of
confusion.

The explanation is this:

The work is transformed into internal energy (Heat I)

dW =

)29(

)30(

The  expression  is  dS  =  dU/T  (not  dS  =  dQ/T)  and  dU  is  the  heat  variation  due  to  the  friction
work, indeed.

All of this can be easily interpreted microscopically but the paradigmatic error (the use of
dS = dQ/T for a quasi-static irreversible transformation) with the confusion between Heat I and
Heat  II,  originates  several  difficulties  associated  with  the  microscopic  interpretation  of  the

12

"Second" principle.

One  of  these  difficulties  is  linked  to  the  affirmation  that  the  entropy  of  an  "isolated
system"  can  only  increase  (F.p.55).  An  "isolated  system"  is  a  System  with  constant  energy
(F.p.11). Here we have again a terminological problem if with the designation "isolated system"
we means "thermally isolated system" (in addition to this, there is the confusion associated with
the concept of thermal -Heat I and Heat II). Note that we are not saying that "isolated system" is
equivalent  to  "thermally  isolated  system",  of  course  (an  "isolated  system"  is  thermally  isolated
but  the  reciprocal  cannot  be  true).  Indeed  we  can  have  a  System  (e.g.  a  gas)  changing  energy
with a piston in a gravitational field. The piston has no entropy, the energy of the piston is only
kinetic  and  potential.  The  energy  of  the  piston  therefore  is  connected  to  the  work  term  [5].
Therefore  we  separate  that  energy  (the  work  term).  The  gas  is  a  non-isolated  System  and  the
entropy change is positive. The gas has the energy of the microscopics entities and therefore has
entropy.

For a non isolated System as well as for an isolated System the entropy change is positive

or zero. Nevertheless for a sub-system the entropy change can be negative.

The entropy variation is due to the variation of the number of microstates.

Only a transformation with an increasing number of microstates is possible.

The energy contributes to this number of microstates and we can have a transformation of
heat into work (with a decrease of the number of microstates associated to the momentum space)
if there is an increase of the total number of microstates. This corresponds to the energy- entropy
principle.

Conclusions

  In this paper we have shown that it is possible to eliminate some terminological conflicts

still existing in thermodynamics.

  Essentially, these conflicts are the following

1.  The word heat is usually associated with the expression of the First Principle
dU  =  dW  +  dQ  (U  is  the  internal  energy  and  dW  and  dQ  are  the  infinitesimal  work  and  the
infinitesimal heat). The quantity dQ can be associated with the internal energy variation of a heat
reservoir. When the  transformation  is  adiabatic  (the  energy  exchange  with  the  heat  reservoir  is
zero), the internal energy of the sub-system considered changes due to the work energy term. For
the  system  (association  of  the  sub-systems  "system"  +  heat  reservoir)  the  transformation  is
always adiabatic.

Therefore the essential quantity of thermodynamics is the internal energy  and  not  the
heat  exchange.  It  is  possible  to  call  to  the  internal  energy  heat.  But  the  internal  energy  is  the
energy  of  the  microscopic  entities,  atoms  and  radiation,  and  because  of  that  it  is  an  entropy
function.  The  increase  of  entropy  results  from  the  increase  of  internal  energy  for  the  same
deformation  variable  (only  as  a  limit  that  energy  and  entropy  does  not  change  -  this  is  the
reversible transformation). Then instead of a "First" and "Second" Principle, Thermodynamics is
characterized by a single principle, the Energy-Entropy Principle. It is impossible for a machine

13

to do work returning to the initial state for two non separate reasons: if the machine returns to the
initial  state  the  internal  energy  is  the  same  and  the  entropy  is  also  the  same.  But  if  the
deformation  variable  is  the  same,  the  energy  would  have  to  be  smaller  for  the  work  to  be
negative,  which  would  correspond  to  a  negative  entropy  variation.  This  is  not  possible.  Only
transformations with a positive entropy variation are possible.

The  word  heat  cannot  be  used  simultaneously  for  the  internal  energy  of  a  sub-system
("system") and for the energy exchanged between this sub-system and the heat reservoir because
this  energy  is  not  equal  to the  internal  energy  variation  of  the  "system"  but  rather  equal  to  the
internal  variation of the heat reservoir. This  is one of the terminological conflicts that has been
solved [29].

2.  The  second  conflict,  although  different,  is  intimately  connected  with  the  first.  A
quasi-static  transformation  is  not  equivalent  to  a  reversible  transformation.  This  confusion  is
related to the former in the following way:

derived from U = U (V,S). For an irreversible quasi-static transformation these two expressions
can be formally related in the following way:

The "First" Principle

is erroneously related to the expression

and

dW -=

dQ =

)35(

For  a  reversible  transformation  dS=0,  and  then,  dQ=0.  For  an  irreversible  quasi-static
transformation

If  dV=0  then  dS  =  dU/T  and  not  dS  =  dQ/T.  It  is  important  to  note  however,  that,  the
paradigmatic error (ironically) leads to the following: people think they are applying dS = dQ/T
=  dU/T  +  pdV/T  to  a  "reversible"  transformation,  when  they  are,  in  fact,  applying  it  to  an
irreversible,  quasi-static  transformation  (because  the  quasi-static  transformation  is  erroneously

14

called reversible). In this irreversible quasi-static transformation

and

dU

)36(

)37(

Thus is understood and eliminated the conflict between the internal energy conceptualization of
heat and the heat exchanged emerging from the "First" Principle. In fact the energy conservation
principle precedes the expression dU = dW + dQ. For a "mechanical" system (Fermi p.11)

dU =

.dW

)38(

But we can write for a "system" (a "thermodynamic system" in contact with a heat reservoir (this
heat reservoir is a sub-system exterior to the "system")

dW

=

dU

+

.edU

)39(

and the "mechanical" condition is satisfied.

The formal expression of the "First" Principle can induce thinking that the quantity dQ is
the  fundamental  element  of  Thermodynamics.  This  is  not  so  and  originates  subtle  mistakes.  In
this  sense  it  is  important  to  think  without  attributing  to  the  "First"  Principle  wrong  physical
interpretations. This can be done with the construction of a single energy-entropy principle.

The microscopic interpretation of the energy-entropy principle  is straightforward related
to  the  "phenomenological"  approach  proposed.  The  tendency  to  a  new  equilibrium  point  with
bigger entropy results from the change of volume and the change of energy, we can say with the
increase of the phase space volume.

Appendix

Carnot  [30]  reasons  by  analogy  with  a  machine  that  works  at  the  expense  of  water

passing from a higher to a lower level reservoir.

If the water could, by itself, pass into a higher level we would have a perpetual machine.
Carnot  associates  the  heat  (or  caloric)  passing  between  two  sources  at  different  temperatures
with  the  water  falling  between  the  two  levels.  The  quantity  of  water  falling  to  the  lower  level
reservoir is equal to the one coming out of the higher level reservoir. However, the energy of the
water is not the same if the water has done work. There is, therefore, no energy conservation for
the water. In the same way, there would be no energy conservation for the caloric - if the caloric

15

existed. In fact the relevant property in this analysis is energy. So the analysis would be correct
even  if  a  substance  associated  with  the  process  existed.  If  the  water  could,  by  itself,  (at  the
expense  of  its  internal  energy)  pass  from  the  lower  into  the  higher  level  reservoir,  a  perpetual
machine  would  exist.  Carnot's  analysis  is  correct  [31]  and  it  contains  the  energy-entropy
principle.

 Today the the meaning and validity conditions of The "First" and "Second" Principle  is
reconsidered  again  [32,  33].    The  physical  interpretation,  the  meaning  and  validity  of  this
interpretation,  depends  (as  usual)  on  the  meaning  of  the  physical  quantities  considered
fundamental.  The  simple  interpretation  adopted  in  this  article  results  from  Carnot  and
Boltzmann’s  analysis  with  the  help  of  Fermi  intuition.  It  seems  convincing.  It  seems  that  the
construction of a perpetuum mobile is impossible. However it is important to be aware about the
claims  that  this  is  not  so.  Those  are  important  and  extraordinary  claims.  If  experimentally
confirmed,  they  are  going  to  change  the  world.  Another  important  problem  linked  with  the
"Second" Law that deserves increasing scientific interest is the problem of the origin of Life on
Earth.  Although  it  is  commonly  accepted  that  the  biological  entities  survive  (evolve)  in
accordance  to  the  Energy  Conservation  Principle  +  "Second"  Principle  there  is  no  consensus
about the origin of Life on Earth based only on those Principles.

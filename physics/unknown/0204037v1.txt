Abstract 

During the last few years superconductive undulators with a period  length  of  3.8  mm  and  14 

mm have been built. In this paper scaling laws for these novel insertion devices are presented:  

a  simple  analytic  formula  is  derived  which  describes  the  achievable  magnetic  field  of  a 

superconcuctive undulator as a function of  gap-width and period length.

Introduction 

During  the  last  few  years  institutes  involved  in  the  development  of  synchrotron  light  sources 

and  FELs  have  shown  increasing  interest  in  superconductive  in-vacuo  undulators.  Efforts  to 

build  such  devices  started  at  various  labs  around  1990  [1].    In  Karlsruhe  activities  have 

focused  on  technical  design  studies  for  a  3.8  mm  period  length  undulator  [2]  followed  by 

beam  tests  at  the  Mainz  Microtron  MAMI  [3]    and  the  construction  of  two  undulators  each 

with a period length of 14 mm for the Singapore Synchrotron Light Source [4] and for ANKA 

[5].  These  studies  have  resulted  in  the  emergence  of  a  clear  concept  of  how  to  build  such 

superconductive undulators and  the cryostats for the various applications.  

The aim of this paper is not to describe the technical layout but to present simple scaling laws 

showing  how  the  maximum  field  strength  varies  with  the  period  length,  the  gap  width,  the 

undulator  current  and  the  pole  width.  With  these  formulas  the  user  of  such  devices  can 

evaluate  the  range  of  obtainable  fields  and  k-values  similar  to  the  formulas  given  for 

permanent  magnet  undulators  in  literature  [6].  A  comparison  of  permanent  undulators  and 

superconductive undulators from a different point of view can be found in [7]. 

Summary on permanent magnet undulators  

It  is  well  known  that  the  magnetic  field  of  permanent  magnet  undulators  (pure  SmCo5 

undulators)  can be described by the approximation [6]  

                                               Bmax [T]= 1.55 exp

                                                    (1)

Where Bmax  is  the  maximum  field  in  T,  g  is  the  width  of  the  gap  in  mm  and  p  is  the  period 

length in mm. Similar formulas are valid for hybrid undulators:

For SmCo5 a = 3.33,  b = 5.47, c = 1.8, for a Nd-Fe-B  a = 3.44, b = 5.08 and c = 1.54.  

Superconductive Undulators 

 

The model used for the field ca lculations for superconductive undulators is sketched in fig. 1 

and  2.  Only  the  section  of  the  undulator  close  to  the  beam  is  shown.  The  darker  parts  are 

made  of  iron,  the  brighter  parts  are  superconducting  wires.  The  current  direction  in  the 

superconductor is alternating. The different colours of the superconductor mark the different 

directions  of  the  current.  The  matching  sections  are  at  the  beginning  and  the  end  of  the 

undulator. The parameters used in the following are defined in fig. 3.  

All  computations  presented  in  this  paper  are  done  with  the    help  of    the  program  SRW 

developed by the ESRF [8]. 

The units for the current density I in the superconductor are kA/mm2. For an undulator with a 

14 mm period length the calculated maximum field is shown in fig. 4. In these calculations it 

was assumed that  the pole width w is 2 mm and the current density varies. 

The dependence of the maximum field on the current density is shown in fig. 5 (gap width g = 

5 mm). The curve shows the two regions of the undulator: the region below circa 0. 2 kA/mm2 

where  the  iron  is  not  saturated  and  the  region  where  the  iron  is  saturated.  For  all  practical 

purposes the region in which the iron is saturated is the most important one. In this region the 

field can be approximated  by the function 

                              Bmax [T] = 0.023+0.045.I + (9.53 + 7.75.I) exp(-0.51.g)                            (3)

I in kA/mm2 and g in mm.  This formula is valid for a 14 mm period length undulator with a 2 

mm pole width w.  

The maximum  field as a function of pole width w and period length p is shown in fig. 6. The 

current density in fig. 6 is 1 kA/mm2. The optimum pole width w is between 2.7 and 2.8 mm. 

The maximum of the curve is rather flat. 

The final formula describing the behaviour of  the superconductive undulator as a function of 

period length p, gap width g and current density I is:  

Bmax[T]=[(0.023+0.045.I)+(9.55+7.75.I).exp(-0.51.g}].

This formula is  compared in fig. 7 with the formula for a permanent magnet undulator. The 

superconductive  undulator  has  a  significantly  higher  field  over  the  permanent  magnet 

undulator.  

NbTi-wires have been used in all prototypes built up to now. The maximum current is limited 

by the magnetic field at the surface of the superconductor. Fig. 8 shows the calculated field 

distribution  inside  the  coiling.  The  dark  bars  mark  the  position  of  the  iron.  The  maximum 

field  on  the  surface  of  the  superconductor  is  about  2.2  Tesla.  Commercial  NbTi 

superconductors can operate at these fields with  current densities of 1.3 to 1.4 kA [2].  

Therefore, curve C in fig. 7 marks the upper limit for  NbTi wires. 

 

 

Summary 

The maximum magnetic field produced by superconductive undulators for a given gap and a 

given period length is higher than the field in permanent undulators. The relation between the 

parameters  current  density,  gap  width  and  period  length  is  summarized  in  the  analytic 

approximation in equation (4).

           maximum in the iron. The boundary between the poles and superconductive wires  

           determines the maximum current.

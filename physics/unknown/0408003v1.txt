ABSTRACT 

Dispersion relations for dipolar modes propagating along a chain of metal nanoparticles 

are calculated by solving the full Maxwell equations, including radiation damping. The 

nanoparticles are treated as point dipoles, which means the results are valid only for a/d ≤ 

⅓, where a is the particle radius and d the spacing. The discrete modes for a finite chain 

are first calculated, then these are mapped onto the dispersion relations appropriate for 

the infinite chain. Computed results are given for a chain of 50-nm diameter Ag spheres 

spaced by 75 nm. We find large deviations from previous quasistatic results: Transverse 

modes interact strongly with the light line. Longitudinal modes develop a bandwidth 

more than twice as large, resulting in a group velocity that is more than doubled. All 

modes for which kmode ≤ ω/c show strongly enhanced decay due to radiation damping.

I. Introduction 

The possibility of using metal nanoparticle chains to propagate optical excitations is 

attractive for integrated optics applications, since it can lead to optical processing 

circuitry with dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the light. Such small optical 

circuits are not possible with conventional integrated optics techniques, which are 

generally diffraction-limited in their size scale. The building blocks for chain waveguides 

are closely-spaced metal spheres or spheroids with sizes in the tens of nanometer range, 

which is an order of magnitude smaller than optical wavelengths. The fundamental 

excitations that lead to propagation are the dipolar resonances of the individual particles 

(also called Mie resonances or plasma resonances).1 In practice these resonances are 

well-defined excitations only for noble metal spheroids and only in the frequency range 

for which the metallic behavior is free-electron-like, i.e., Re(ε) < 0 and Im(ε) < -Re(ε), 

where ε(ω) is the complex metal dielectric response function. 

 

 

Several recent studies investigate mode propagation in metal nanoparticle chains. 23456 

Quinten et al.2 give numerical results for a chain of Ag spheres and find a 900 nm 1/e 

intensity decay length for 50-nm diameter spheres, spaced by d = 75 nm and excited at 

the dipole resonant frequency. Propagation is found only for longitudinal excitation, i.e., 

the dipole moments aligned along the chain direction. Perpendicular propagation is much 

more highly attenuated. Brongersma et al.3 model a similar chain of Ag spheres, but they 

treat them as point dipoles and include only the lowest order quasistatic 1/r3 interaction 

between the dipoles. They derive dispersion relations for modes in an infinite chain and 

find similar results for longitudinal and transverse propagation. Park and Stroud4 allow 

2 

for finite-sized metal spheres, but still within the quasistatic approximation, by including 

the higher order multipole fields in the interparticle interactions. These interactions 

become important when the particles are nearly touching. However, as long as a ≤ d/3, 

where a is the particle radius and d the separation, they show that the point-dipole results 

are adequate for the lowest (dipolar) bands. Maier et al.6 present results from finite-

difference time-domain simulations for chains of 25-nm radius Au spheres spaced by 75 

nm, which they claim yield dispersion relations correlating well with the point-dipole 

model. 

 

In this paper we extend the results discussed above to include the full, time-dependent 

fields of the oscillating dipoles. We retain the point dipole approximation, which is 

certainly adequate for frequencies near the dipolar resonance and so long as the sphere 

separation is more than about three times the radius.  However, the interactions between 

dipoles now contain terms varying as 1/r and 1/r2, in addition to the quasistatic 1/r3 term. 

We also include in the dipole polarizability the effects of radiation damping. These 

refinements to the theory lead to major changes in the nature of the modes. Modes near 

the Brillouin zone center, which are at the highest frequency for transverse propagation 

and the lowest for longitudinal, are now highly damped via radiation damping, even in 

the absence of loss in the metal. The modes for transverse propagation are drastically 

modified when their dispersion relation crosses the light line. This is the phase matching 

condition between the free photon and the dipolar chain mode, and it is not surprising that 

it leads to a strong effect. In Section II we consider an infinite chain and recover previous 

quasistatic results.3,4,6 The infinite chain can be solved exactly in the quasistatic case, but 

 

3 

the inclusion of retardation requires a difficult analytic continuation into the lower half 

frequency plane. We have found it simpler to avoid this difficulty by considering a finite 

chain, which we do in Section III. A chain of N particles will have N discrete normal 

modes. In the limit of large N, the normal mode frequencies form a continuous 

distribution, corresponding to the dispersion relation ω = ω(k). We show how to find 

these modes and to map them onto the dispersion curve for an infinite chain. In Section 

IV we consider propagation of a driven excitation along the chain. We give some 

numerical results for various potential experiments and previous model calculations and 

finally provide a brief summary.

Here r is the position vector pointing from the dipole to the field point. We should 

emphasize that this expression contains the full effects of retardation. For a linear chain 

of point dipoles spaced a distance d, in the absence of an applied field, the field at each 

dipole is the sum of the fields due to all the other dipoles. The induced moment on the nth 

dipole is the polarizability α(ω) times this field,

For k real these equations are to be solved for the complex normal mode frequencies ω = 

ω(k). Since the normal modes must be decaying in time, it is clear that these normal 

mode frequencies must have a negative imaginary part, Im(ω) ≤ 0. However, because of 

the factor 

ie

/ω , the sums converge only for Im(ω) ≥ 0. There is a prescription for 
cdj

dealing with this difficulty: evaluate the sums in the upper half-plane and then 

analytically continue them into the lower half-plane. In the following Section we show 

how to avoid this procedure by considering a finite chain. This difficulty disappears in 

the quasistatic approximation, which corresponds to forming the limit c → ∞. Before 

discussing this limit, we must say something about the polarizability.

as the added term is small.10  

where ωp is the plasma frequency and ν the electron scattering rate. To be consistent with 

our inclusion of retardation in the dipole fields, we must include the effect of radiation 

reaction in the polarizability. This effect can be introduced through the usual 

Although this form can lead to acausal behavior in the response, it is satisfactory so long

where ω0 = ωp/√3 is the plasma resonance frequency for the sphere. Here, as in the 

equations (3), the upper equation is for the transverse case and the lower for the 

longitudinal. One can see by inspection that for real kd these expressions are analytic in 

the upper half ω-plane. The difficulty, as noted above, is with the evaluation in the lower 

half-plane, where the sums diverge.

We return to this difficulty in the following Section, but first we consider the quasistatic 

response for a lossless metal sphere, which corresponds to setting ν = 0 and c = ∞. The 

polarizability (4) then takes on the simple form:

The sums in these equations can be easily evaluated to yield the dispersion relations 

plotted as solid curves in Fig. 1. These results are the same as those obtained earlier by 

Brongersma et al.3 and Park and Stroud.4 

III. Finite chain 

We remarked above that the infinite sums in the dispersion relations (3) do not converge 

for Im(ω) < 0, where normal mode frequencies must lie. A simple way to avoid this 

problem is to consider a finite chain. As we show explicitly in the following, a chain of 

20 spheres is adequate to obtain a dispersion curve. For a chain of N spheres, equation (2) 

becomes a set of N coupled equations in the N unknown moments of the spheres. We 

write these equations in matrix form: 

0=Mp

(12) 

For a chain of N spheres there will be N normal modes. The problem is analogous to that 

of a chain of coupled oscillators in which each oscillator is coupled to all the others. We 

have used MATLAB® 6 to solve this problem for a chain of 20 spheres. For the purpose 

of comparison with previous results, we choose a = 25 nm and d = 75 nm. Since we are 

interested in the response near the dipolar resonance of an Ag sphere, we fix ωp and ν to 

yield the optical constants of Ag at the resonance frequency ħω0 = 3.5 eV, which gives 

ħωp = 6.18 eV and ħν = 0.7 eV.11 The results are shown in Tables 1 & 2, where we give 

the real and imaginary parts of the dimensionless normal mode frequencies ω/ω0. The 

electron scattering loss is underestimated for these small particles, since we use bulk 

optical properties. However, this loss mechanism is still the primary cause of the mode 

damping.

The first column in the tables is the mode number, which we define as one plus the 

number of sign changes in the normal mode solution. To find this solution and, hence, the 

mode number, we solve the driven problem, 

  Mp = v, 

with a simple choice for the column vector v (for example all but the first row equal to 

zero). Evaluating M at the resonance frequency, the normal mode solution is 

 

p = M-1 v. 

Strictly speaking, if ω is exactly at the normal mode frequency, this solution will be 

infinite, since det(M) = 0, but in practice because of the small numerical inaccuracy the 

solution will be large but finite. In Fig. 2 we show the real part of this normal mode 

solution plotted versus sphere number for three examples, all for the transverse case. 

Corresponding plots for the longitudinal modes look identical. The top and bottom 

examples correspond, respectively, to the maximum (19) and minimum (0) number of 

sign changes. The middle curve shows one sign change. Clearly these mode solutions are 

suggestive of standing waves, and the mode number is easily determined. In the second 

column of the Tables we show a value of kd for each mode. We make this assignment

with the formula

where n is the mode number. Note that for n = 1 this formula gives a wavelength λ = 

2Nd, in agreement with the profile shown in the bottom of Fig. 2. The point in 

introducing this quantity is that we can view these calculated points as a discrete 

approximation to the continuous dispersion curve in the Brillouin zone for an infinite 

periodic array. Finally, in the remaining columns of the Tables, we give the real and 

 

9 

imaginary parts of the calculated dimensionless normal mode frequencies, first with the 

inclusion of loss in the metal and then for the purely radiative case. 

From the Tables we see that in the absence of loss in the metal, where all the loss is due 

to the radiated power, the points nearer the zone center have much larger imaginary parts 

than those near the zone boundary. This effect is much reduced for a lossy metal, where 

the imaginary parts are always large. The mode number dependence is a radiation effect 

that will be discussed more fully below. 

In Fig.3 we plot results for the transverse case. The solid curve is the same quasistatic 

result shown in Fig.1, and the solid round points are the quasistatic normal mode 

frequencies obtained by the above method for a finite chain with 20 particles. The 

excellent agreement indicates that a finite chain of 20 particles is sufficient to reproduce 

the dispersion relation for an infinite chain. We expect this to be true even with the 

inclusion of the full retarded fields. The square points are a plot of the real values given 

in Table 1. The points are joined by dotted straight line segments to guide the eye. The 

nearly vertical dashed line is the light line ω = ck. There is a dramatic deviation from the 

quasistatic result when the light line intersects the dispersion curve. At this point the 

dipolar modes are phase-matched to the free photon propagating along the chain at the 

same frequency. Finally, the triangular points correspond to an ideal metal (ν = 0) with 

the same plasma frequency, showing the small effect on the dispersion curve of loss in 

the metal. However, metallic loss has a larger effect on the imaginary part of the mode 

frequency, especially for kd near π. 

10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In Fig. 4 we show the same results for the longitudinal case. The biggest difference here, 

compared with transverse excitation, is that there is no sharp interaction with the light 

line, since only transverse photons can propagate along the chain. There are also 

significant differences compared with the quasistatic approximation, e.g., the band width 

is nearly doubled by the inclusion of the full retarded fields and the group velocity near 

the band center is increased by more than a factor of two. 

The effects of radiation damping are shown in Fig. 5, where we plot the imaginary part of 

the normal mode frequency as a function of kd for a lossless metal chain. For any k-value 

such that kmode < ω/c, the array will generate strong far-field radiation at an angle θ  to the 

chain axis where cos(θ)= kmode c/ω. This condition on k occurs approximately at mode 

number 9, indicated by the dashed vertical line in Fig. 5 for the parameters we are using; 

it leads to a large increase in –Im(ω/ω0) for all lower modes. The result applies to both 

longitudinal and transverse modes. 

IV Propagation along a finite chain 

In the previous Section we considered the problem of determining the complex normal 

mode frequencies. In terms of a dispersion relation ω = ω(k), we there found the complex 

ω for real k. In discussing propagation we must, so to speak, invert this problem and 

study propagation in a chain of spheres driven with a real frequency. Consider, therefore, 

a chain in which the first sphere is driven with an applied optical field at frequency ω = 

ω0. The column-vector of the dipole moments will then be given by Eq. (14), but now 

11 

with the matrix M evaluated at the real driving frequency ω0 and with v the column 

vector in which all but the first row is zero. The result for a chain of 50 Ag spheres is 

shown in Fig. 6, in which the square of the absolute value of the dipole moment is plotted 

versus distance both for longitudinal and transverse excitations. Note that after an initial 

transient in which the decay is rapid and nonexponential, these log plots become 

approximately straight lines (with endpoint effects for the last few spheres in the chain). 

We fit a straight line to the points n = 35-45 and extract the decay lengths α-1 shown in 

the figure. Although the choice of points to use for the fit is somewhat arbitrary, this 

choice gives an excellent fit and it allows us to compare with the decay lengths obtained 

by other methods. To get the phase of the wave, we fit the calculated complex dipole 

moment to the form

. 

(16) 

The results are shown in Fig. 7, where the real part of the dipole moment is plotted versus 

distance, again for longitudinal and transverse excitation. The fitted curves are shown as 

solid lines, the points are the solution of Eq. (14). 

 

 

Quinten et al.2 considered this same problem of propagation down a chain of 50 Ag 

spheres. They included the effect of higher multipoles, but restricted the calculation to the 

near field, which we interpret to mean the quasistatic approximation. Thus their 

calculation should be based on the same model as that of Park and Stroud.4 But as shown 

by these latter authors, the effects of higher multipoles are negligible for the parameters 

chosen (a/d = ⅓). Therefore, we conclude that the differences between our results and 

those of Quinten et al. are entirely due to our inclusion of the effects of retardation. The 

12 

most important difference is that Quinten et al. conclude that no significant propagation 

occurs for transverse excitation. On the contrary, as shown in Fig. 6, we find that 

although for transverse excitation the initial decay is more rapid, at long distances the 

decay is even slower than that for longitudinal excitation. Surprisingly, the 1/e decay 

length they find for longitudinal excitation (α-1 = 900 nm) is comparable to ours (~ 700 

nm). 

 

 

 

Our quasistatic solution to the same chain of 50 Ag spheres shows a much faster initial 

decay. We also find that the initial decay rate is lowest when the chain is excited near the 

band center (ω = ω0), but the rate far down the chain is rather insensitive to the driving 

frequency. However, this result depends on our use of the Drude model for the metal 

response, which is clearly not valid far from the band center. 

Maier et al.6 recently simulated propagation in a chain of 50-nm diameter Au spheres 

spaced by 75 nm using a finite-difference time-domain method that solves the full set of 

Maxwell’s equations. They chose Drude parameters (ħωp = 4.47 eV, ħν = 0.164 eV) to 

model the optical response of Au in the vicinity of the plasma resonance. However, these 

parameters do not fit the Au optical data of Johnson and Christy,11 nor are they consistent 

with the simulated results shown in their Fig. 2.12 These authors state that their simulated 

data “are in excellent agreement with the predictions from the point-dipole model”. Since 

the model they refer to is quasistatic, this statement is difficult to reconcile with the fact 

that we find rather large differences between the full solution to Maxwell’s equations and 

the quasistatic approximation. 

13 

 

 

 

 

A drawback of using spherical noble-metal particles is that the d-band absorption at the 

plasma resonance frequency significantly increases the loss in the metal above its free-

electron value. This is especially true for Au and Cu and to a lesser extent for Ag. The 

solution to this problem, as discussed extensively in the literature on surface-enhanced 

Raman scattering,1314 is to use non-spherical particles. All of the methods developed 

above for spherical particle chains can be easily adapted to spheroidal particles with a 

single change. The expression for α(ω)/a3 in Eq.(11) for the diagonal elements of the 

matrix M must be replaced by the general formula for a spheroid:

where V is the volume of the spheroid and L is the depolarization factor.1 For a sphere, L 

= ⅓; for a prolate spheroid in the long direction or an oblate spheroid in the wide 

direction, L will be less than ⅓, and the plasma resonance will be shifted to lower 

frequencies. This frequency shift lowers both the d-band absorption loss and the radiative 

damping loss. 

In summary, we have found the dispersion relations for dipolar modes propagating in a 

chain of metal nanoparticles. We use the point-dipole model for the fields, which means 

the results are valid when the sphere spacing is greater than or equal to about three times 

the sphere radius, and we solve the full Maxwell equations including the retarded fields. 

The effects of these retarded fields are quite striking compared with results from previous 

quasistatic treatments. In a lossless metal radiation damping affects all modes for which 

kmode < ω/c. Transverse modes are strongly perturbed when kmode ≅ ω/c. Longitudinal 

14 

modes develop a larger bandwidth, and their group velocity is more than twice its value 

in the quasistatic case.

and D. W. Pohl, J. Appl. Phys. 81, 1798 (1997) and the discussion following their Eq.

for the frequencies and particle sizes considered here.

12  The plasma resonance of a sphere occurs when Re(ε) = -2, i.e., the denominator of 

Eq.(4) vanishes. The Drude parameters of ref. 6 yield ħω0 = 2.59 eV, which is close to

the point at which Re(ε) = -2 for Au from the ref. 11 optical data. However, the same 

Drude parameters yield Im(ε) = 0.19, compared with Im(ε) = 4.3 from ref.11. Moreover, 

Fig. 2 of ref. 6 shows ħω0 = 2.40 eV instead of 2.59 eV.

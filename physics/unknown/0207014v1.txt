It is shown that under the definite regime of interaction of the acoustic waves with low-temperature, partially
ionized plasma it is possible to change the intensity of some spectral lines of atomic argon. It is shown also,
that  the  dependence  of  the  intensities  of  these  spectral  lines  on  the  intensity  of  the  acoustic  wave  has  a
hysteresis behavior.

The research on properties of low-temperature ionized plasma and on the influences on it is

always  urgent,  since  besides  the  elucidation  of  new  physical  mechanisms,  the  results  of  these

investigations quickly find practical application. It is noteworthy, however, that the influence of

acoustic  waves  on  plasma  parameters  and  on  processes  in  the  plasma  environment  are  studied

relatively poor. Besides, high interest arose lately to the problem of interactions of acoustic waves

with  such  thermodynamically  nonequilibrium  gas  as  is  the  partially  ionized  plasma  of  gas

discharge, where the electron temperature usually much exceeds that of heavier particles [1(cid:150) 6].

Note that of numerous problems connected with the interactions of acoustic waves with partially

ionized plasma, the special promising is the influence of  acoustic waves on radiation spectra of

gas-discharge  plasma.    Last  years,  an  interesting  effect  consisting  in  sharp  change  of  radiation

spectrum under action of sonic wave in dense  (p ~ 100 Torr) gas discharge plasma of argon was

observed in our laboratory  [7]. After several seconds from cutting out the sonic wave, in different

points  of  the  discharge  tube  in  the  bulk  of  positive  column  flashes  of  radiation  were  observed

during  several  minutes,  that  corresponded  to  definite  transitions  between  electronic  levels  of

atomic  argon.  An  assumption  was  made  about  the  autogeneration  of  appropriate  lines  in  the

spectrum of argon.

The studies of the change of  a radiation spectrum under the influence of acoustic waves

were  conducted  using  low-temperature  argon  gas  discharge  plasma  (pressure  (cid:150)  100  Torr,

discharge  current  -  50  mA,  voltage  on  electrodes  2  kV).  The  experimental  set-up  (Fig.1)  is  a

quartz discharge tube with internal diameter of 60 and length of 1000 mm. The distance between

the electrodes was 850 mm. An electrodynamic transmitter is attached to one of butt ends of the

Figure1.   The experimental set up:1 (cid:150)is the discharge tube; 2 (cid:150) electrodes; 3 (cid:150) the electrodynamic transmitter

tube. The light emitted from plasma is extracted through the second butt to a monochromator that

is used for investigation of variations of some spectral lines of plasma radiation under the action

of acoustic waves.

The investigations showed [7] that variations of argon plasma radiation are manifested as

flashes with duration of 15 (cid:150) 20 ms. As is seen from Fig.2 c, d, the flashes are of orange and blue

colour. These flashes arise independently one of the other. The orange flashes appear on the outer

side of the border of discharge pinch, whereas

the  blue  flashes  burst  inside  the  discharge

pinch.

An analysis of the spectral composition of

flashing  radiation  showed  that  these  correspond

to  three  transitions  between  energy  levels  of

atomic argon:

7p’[1/2]1 - 4p [1/2]1wave length 4876 ¯

7s [3/2]1 - 4p [5/2]3 wave length 5888 ¯

4d’[3/2]1 - 4p [1/2]1 wave length 5882 ¯

A  diagram  of  the  energy  levels  of  these

transition  in  argon  is  presented  in  Fig.  3.  As

one  can  see  from  this  figure,  the  oscillator

strengths  of 

the  4p-4s 

transition 

are

approximately  30-100  times  greater  than  the

oscillator  strengths  of  the  above-indicated

transitions. For this reason, the 4p level is

rapidly depopulated. As a results, a population inversion can arise between each of the levels 7p’,

7s and 4d’ on the one hand and the 4p level on the other. This population inversion can evidently

serve at the reason for the appearance of the observed flashes. As a result of further research of

these lines it was shown that under definite interaction regime of acoustic waves with plasma the

change  in  the  plasma  radiation  is  manifested  not  only  by  flashes,  but  also  by  essential

amplification of above spectral lines.

The spectra of argon plasma radiation taken with  the  help  of  the  aforementioned  device

are shown in Fig.4: the spectrum of plasma radiation prior to the interaction with acoustic waves

is given in Fig.4a; the spectrum of plasma radiation under the influence of intense acoustic waves

(of more than 82 dB) and of acoustic waves with intensity less than 82 dB are shown in Figs.4b

and figure 4(c) respectively.

The  dependence  of  radiation  intensity  of    4d’[3/2]1-4p[1/2]1  transition  on  the  acoustic

wave intensity at frequency of 190 Hertz is given in Fig.5 and is seen to have hysteresis behavior.

When the intensity of acoustic waves increases (from the zeroth value) to Amax (that corresponds

to  90  dB),  no  any  change  in  the  radiation  spectrum  is  observed  and  for  these  intensities  of

acoustic waves a decontraction of plasma takes place  and it fills the volume of tube completely

(Fig.2(b)). During the return path of acoustic wave intensity, a notable increase in line radiation

intensity  is  observed  at  a  definite  value  Ac.  The  critical  value  Ac  corresponds  to  the

unpinching threshold of  the discharge (82  dB).

The  line  intensity  is  observed  to  increase  after

the  pinching  of  discharge.  A  further  lessening

of acoustic wave intensity is accompanied with

smooth decrease of the line intensity

For  determination  of  relation  between

the  constant  increase  of  spectral  line  intensity

and the flashes we have plotted the dependences

that will be discussed below. At the return path

A, the reduction in acoustic wave intensity stays

on the value Ao, that corresponds to 80 dB and is

less  than  Ac  (Fig.5).  In  figure  6(a)  the  time

dependence  of  radiation  intensity  of  4d’[3/2]1-

4p[1/2]1  transition  under  constant  influence  of

resonant  acoustic  waves  with  frequency  of  190

Hertz  and  intensity  A0  is  presented.  It  is  seen,

that in the absence of flashes the intensity of line

radiation  has  a  constant  value  Io.  During  the

bursting  of  flashes  the  line  intensity  sharply

increases (in nearly 100 times) up to Imax. After

the bursting of a flash (with duration of 15 (cid:150) 20

ms)  the  intensity  drops  to  the  minimum  Imin  ,

which  corresponds  to  the  value  of  radiation

intensity in the absence of acoustic waves.

interaction  with  acoustic  waves:  b)  the  spectrum  of
plasma  radiation  under  the  influence  of  intense
acoustic  waves  (of  more  than  82  dB):  c)  the
spectrum of plasma radiation under the influence of
acoustic waves (of less than 82 dB).

The rise of intensity from Imin to Io is rather long, ~1s. Shown in the second plot (Fig.6(b))

is  the  dependence  of  radiation  intensity  of  an  analogous  transition  after  cutting-out  of  acoustic

waves,  that  has  the  initial  frequency  of  190  Hertz  and  intensity  (cid:150)  90  dB.  After  cutting-out  of

acoustic  waves  the  line  intensity  keeps  on  at  the  minimum  initial  value  of  Imin  during  several

seconds (~2s). The value of Io is reached in to time and at the further increase in time, Io smoothly

decreases to Imin in 15 (cid:150) 20 s. The pattern of bursting of flashes in this regime is analogous to the

previous case  (Fig.6(a)).

For  explanation  of  this  effect  recall  that  the  sonic  wave  can  strongly  change  the

parameters of plasma [8] including the concentration and temperature of electrons Ne and Te. It is

known  that  an  intense  resonant  acoustic  wave  gives  rise  to  vortex  motion  of  gas  [9]  in  a

volume(in the presence of a gradient of oscillatory velocity). These vortex motions of the gas are

known  as  (cid:147)acoustical  flows(cid:148).  The  indispensable  condition  for  the    rise  of    such  flows  in
cylindrical vessels (similar to our discharge tube) is  λ >>R, where  λ is the wavelength and  R is

the    radius  of  tube.  The  diagram  of  such  flows  in  a  tube  is  shown  in  Fig.7.  The  velocity  of

acoustic flow depends on the acoustic wave intensity, and changes of flow velocity may lead to a

change of Ne and Te in different points. For cases realized in our experiments, the change of Ne

and  Te  is  pronounced,  e.g.,  in  places,  where  the  enhancement  of  4d’[3/2]1  -  4p[1/2]1  line  is

observed  (outside  the  radial  border  of  pinch).  The  population  of  highly  excited  levels  of  argon

atoms  in  these  thermodynamically  manifest  nonequilibrium  ranges  may  strongly  increase  and

there exists a possibility of inversion between definite levels. As is known, there are two types of

nonequilibrium,- the ionization and the recombination ones.  In the first  case the local degree of

ionization is less than the equilibrium one, corresponding to Te, and in the second case, on the

waves, the initial value of  frequency  of   which  was  190 Hz   and   intensity(cid:150)90 dB.

contrary, is more. At a definite value of acoustic flow intensity in places, where the enhancement

of  4d’[3/2]1  -  4p[1/2]1  line  is  observed,  the  recombination  nonequilibrium  is  effected.  Most

probably, the dependence of acoustic flow intensity in the discharge tube on acoustic wave

intensity  has  a  hysteresis  behavior.  The  required  intensity  of  acoustic  flow  is  obtained  on  the

return path of hysteresis loop, i.e., at the reduction of acoustic wave intensity.

There  are  three  reasons  that  have  inspired  me  to  translate  Frenkel’s  article  [1].  
First, although the article has been published decades ago (1948), there is still no English 
translation.  Second, while I was attending the 57th APS DFD conference, I have realized 
that  Frenkel’s results have attracted great interest by the attendees, however the general 
community  is  widely  unaware  of  his  elegant  findings.    And  third,  when  I  have  read 
papers that cite Frenkel’s publication (I have only found four [2-5]), I have realized that 
many people misunderstand his result. For example, J.J. Bikerman 1950 [2], like others 
after  him,  has  only  understood  Frenkel’s  conclusion  superficially,  considering  only  the 
scenario of the drop motion, instead of the entire mathematical subtlety that the problem 
involves.    In  my  opinion,  the  beauty  of  the  Frenkel’s  article  is  in  the  details  of  his 
statements.  

Y.I.  Frenkel  was  probably  the  first  person  to  state  and  solve  both  problems  of 
capillarity: the problem concerning the droplet shape on the horizontal and the inclined 
surface.  He  pointed  out  that  the  Young-Neumann  formula  plays  the  role  of  a  boundary 
condition, and it needs to be generalized when the droplet surface exhibits a contact angle 
  (that  people 
hysteresis.  He  has  shown  that  the  formula 
studying  the  motion  of  the  droplet  on  the  inclined  surface  due  to  experiment  find  so 
lovely) is just a boundary condition; it is not universal, and it depends on the statement of 
the problem.

On the behavior of liquid drops on a solid surface 
1. The sliding of drops on an inclined surface 
Y.I. Frenkel  
translated by Berejnov Viatcheslav, berejnov@cornell.edu, 2005 

Abstract 
 
The  problem  of  contact  angle  variations  of  a  droplet  that  is  at  rest  on  an  inclined  solid 
surface is considered. The limit inclination angle at which the droplet begins to move is 
determined. It is found that the motion of the drop takes place due to the transport of its 
own liquid forward with a simultaneous rear edge detachment from the solid surface. In 
the case of a good wetting, the drop leaves an unstable liquid trace behind, which in time 
ruptures into a number of small droplets. 
 
1. Contact angles. 
 
For  mathematical  simplification  of  some  capillarity  problems,  and  particularly  for  the 
contact angle problem of a drop on a solid surface, it is useful to approximate the shape 
of the drop with an infinite cylinder. This simplification allows us to reduce the problem 
from  three  to  two  dimensions.  In  this  case,  the  “drop”  should  be  considered  as  a  two-
dimensional  figure  with  contour  s  (partly  constituted  by  the  surface  of  the  solid)  and 
characterized by the conservation of its area S. In addition, when the surface is horizontal 
the drop has an equilibrium contact angle q 0, which according to Neumann’s law is given 
by:  

=
s
(
where  s 20,  s 21,  s 10  are  surface  tension  coefficients  on  the  liquid/air  boundary,  on  the 
liquid/solid boundary, and on the solid/air boundary, respectively (Fig. 1).

On

and  q 1<q 0  for 
the  rear 
angle,  respectively (Fig.21).

As 
increases the angle q 2 increases and the angle q 1 decreases. For some critical angle a =a * 
which  corresponds  to  values  of q 1=q 1
*  and  q 2=q 2
*,  the  drop  begins  running  down  the 
surface (for sufficiently large drops). In the case of poor wetting, the drop does not leave 
any liquid trace behind as it does in the case of good wetting. This liquid trace can in time 
separate into the small droplets due to its instability (similarly to 
the instability of a three-dimensional liquid jet). 
The  small  droplets  are  pinned  by  the  solid  surface  even  for 
a =180O  which  corresponds  to  the  hanging  drop  case  (Fig.  3). 
This last example illustrates that the Neumann law is not general 

the

and the contact angle can vary due to external forces that are acting on the drop. Another 
evidence  of  Neumann  law  limitations  is  the  phenomena  of  rupturing  of  the  liquid trace 
behind the drop into separate droplets and a number of effects known as “contact angle 
hysteresis” which even today are still puzzling from the theoretical point of view (written 
in 1948 – B.V. note). 
 
2. The shape of a droplet lying on a horizontal surface. 
 
Before  considering  the  phenomena  mentioned  above,  we  will  give  a  more  general 
definition of  “contact angle” proceeding from the principle of  minimum total energy for 
the drop on a flat horizontal surface.  
This energy consists of the following parts: 
1. The surface energies 
 corresponding to the fluid/solid interface and 
U
corresponding to the free part of the droplet’s surface. Let s1 be the length of 
the  AB  interval  (Fig.  1)  and  s2  be  the  length  of  the  curve  connecting  A  and  B.    We 
calculate the energy of the drop per unit length of the cylinder whose normal section is 
the  two-dimensional  drop  we  are  considering.  The  fact  that  U1  is  proportional  to  the 
difference between s 12 and s 10 corresponds a reduction of the free area2 of the solid as s1 
increases. 
2.  The  gravitational  energy  (or  an  energy  of  other external forces that are acting on the

given per unit length of the cylinder that is used instead the real drop. X is the abscissa of 
a certain point, y is the height of the drop contour under this point, r  is the fluid density, 
and g is the gravitational acceleration constant.  Therefore, the total energy of the drop is 
given by the formula:

2 I believe that instead of the area here should be the energy. The size of the area has nothing to do with the 
s 12  and  s 10  difference,  it  just  proportional  to  s,  and  it  makes  the  sentence  trivial  and  completely 
independent of s 12 -s 10.  However, the free energy depends on such difference in a way as described in the 
sentence because of the negative sign (s 12 <s 10). (B.V.)

integral gives an area of the 2-d drop that remains constant for any deformation of the drop shape. (B.V.)

Linearization of equation (4), or its replacement by equation (5), is possible only in the 
case  of  perfect  wetting  of  the  solid  by  the  liquid.  The  drop  profile  is  then  an  inverted 
catenary (see Fig. 4).

4. Variation of drop contact angles on a tilted surface at equilibrium. 
 
Let  us  now  consider  the  drop  behavior  on  the inclined surface. We should only change 
the expression for the potential energy U3 while keeping the same coordinate system (x is 
along  the  surface,  y  is  perpendicular  to  it).  Let  us 
introduce  an  additional  coordinate  system,  which 
consists of the horizontal axis x  and vertical axis h . We 
denote by a  the angle between coordinate systems (x, y) 
and  (x , h ).  We  calculate  the  energy  U3  relative  to  any 
fixed  horizontal  plane,  for  example  one  containing  the 
axis  x .    We  assume  both  coordinate  frames  (x,  y)  and 
(x , h )  have  the  same  origin  x=0,  y=0  which  coincides 
with the drop center at a =0.  The height of any point on

To determine the angles q 1 and q 2 separately, it is necessary to add one more condition to 
equation (11). This new condition should correspond to such variation of X1 and X2 for 
which  the  integral (cid:1)(cid:1)
  is  constant.  This  problem  is reduced to a

5. The limit of the inclination angle and the mechanism of drop movement. 
 
If a drop is large enough, then at a certain inclination angle a =a * it begins to run down 
the surface, not leaving any visible trace behind in the case of poor wetting, or leaving a 
liquid trace in case of  perfect wetting.

Before discussing this effect, we should note the known fact from hydrodynamics that a 
fluid flowing over a solid sticks to its surface, i.e. the fluid cannot slip with respect to the 
surface.  Therefore,  the  only  mechanism  for  the  drop  to  run  down  is  a  “pouring”  of  the 
fluid  from  the  rear  edge  of  the  drop  to  the  front  edge.  This 
mechanism  is  similar  to  the  motion  of  the  caterpillar  tractor 
(Fig. 6).   
Such “pouring” begins only when the work of the gravitational 
force is greater than or equal to the work of adhering forces of 
the drop’s rear edge.  
To  tear  off  the  rear  edge  of  the  (two-dimensional)  drop  from 
the  surface  on  the  segment  of  length  A1A1’=dx,  it  is  necessary  to  apply  work  in  the 
amount 
 is the energy of adhesion of the fluid to the 
12
solid per unit area.  Due to the process of pouring of the detached layer of the fluid from 
the rear edge to the front edge, the drop is shifted downwards with the same profile by a 
segment dx2=dx1. The gravity force does the work:

Therefore, the limit of the inclination angle a =a *  for which the drop begins to run down 
the plane is determined by the expression:

Let us note that the maximum value of the right hand side is equal to 2s . If the adhesion 
energy  D s   
(cid:0) is  greater  than  the  self-adhesion  energy  of  the  fluid,  then  the  drop  does  not 
detach  from  the  solid  interface.  Instead,  the  drop  leaves  behind  a  liquid  trace 
approximately 10-5 cm thick (the order of the surface force length scale), as if making a 
pathway for itself. In that case, expression (15) should be written:

It is clear from the last expression that it is not possible for the drop to roll down when 
). In that case, the droplet stays in place even if the surface is 
m
vertical or even more, if the surface is overturned (see Fig. 3 above).  
Substituting m by p R2r , where R is the drop’s radius (or rather the radius of the cylinder) 
in the non-deformed state, we arrive at the minimal value of R for which the drop begins 
to move (at

5 The fact that instead of the area uncovered near the drop’s rear edge, the drop covers the same area on the 
front  edge (Fig. 6 B.V.) has no special importance for determination of the drop motion conditions.  The 
gravity  forces  that  lead  to  tearing  of  the  liquid  from  the  drop’s  rear  edge  are  weaker  than  the  adhesion 
forces. However, the primary importance lies in the product of the force by the arm, as it is in case of the 
solid arm.

Because  of  the practical importance of the above relations, we will reconsider them for 
the case of a three-dimensional drop. Suppose the drop contact with the horizontal solid 
forms  a  circle  of  radius  r.    When  the  drop  moves  a  distance  dX1,  it 
reveals at the rear edge of the drop the surface of a crescent enclosed 
by  the  initial  and  final position of the circle (Fig. 7). The area of this 
crescent is equal to

Of course this formula is true in case of poor wetting only (i.e. in  the case  D
example water on paraffinized glass). In the case of good wetting, D

where  a2=D s /2r g    (or  s /2r g  for  D s >2s ).    In  case  of  water  (s /2r g)1/2  =  0.3  cm,  so  if 
r~R=0.3 cm then sina *=1, and consequently the drop is not able to move.  
       The above discussion on the drop’s motion over the solid can be applied with minor 
variations to motion of gas bubbles on a solid-liquid interface (for example on the surface 
of  a  carbon  electrode  during  the  electrolysis  of  aluminum  from  AlF3).  The  only 
) the bubble has the same shape 
differences are that in the case of poor wetting (
as the drop would in the case of good wetting and vice versa, and that the bubble moves 
upwards along the solid whereas the droplet moves downwards. The shape of the bubble 
changes only slightly under hydrostatic pressure compared to the drop’s shape, so that the 
bubble on top of a horizontal solid surface has the same shape as a drop hanging from an 
overturned solid surface. 
 
6. Contact angle hysteresis and similar phenomena.  
 
The liquid trace left behind the running drop, in the case of  perfect wetting, should have 
a flat jet shape i.e. the shape of a film with the slowly decreasing width (as the drop size 
decreases slowly during motion). This film is presumably unstable in the same way as the 
usual  three-dimensional  jet  which,  according  to  Rayleigh,  should  separate  into  distinct 
droplets.  If  the  liquid  wets  the  solid  only  partially  (for  example,  a  drop  on  a  slightly 
dusted  glass  surface),  then  in  time  the  liquid  trace  of  the  running  down  drop  separates 
into  small  droplets.  These  droplets  are  elongated  along  the  general  direction  of  drop’s 
motion and form a dash-like trace on the surface. These droplets are very well known and 
can be observed on the window of a fast moving train or car during rain. The worse the 
wetting, the less time it takes for separation into droplets. 
To  determine  the  “liquid  trace”  thickness  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  the 
interaction between the liquid and the solid in a less schematic fashion than above. For 
that we should not consider the capillary forces as being constrained to the interface, but 
as creating some surface field of interaction near the solid. The range of that field is on 
the order of 10-5 cm and its strength is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance.

The average thickness of the liquid film left on the solid surface should reach the same 
order of magnitude estimation.   
The rupture of the liquid film into separate droplets is similar to the rolling up process of 
the previously over-spread drop, or to the inverse process of  the spreading of a drop that 
was previously over-rolled. In the last two cases (horizontal surface), the deviation of the 
contact  angle  q   from  its  common  value  q 0  that  corresponds  to  the  minimum  energy 
governs the processes. The contact angle q   approaches q 0 due to the change in the area of 
the droplet-solid interface. Moreover, similarly to the case of a downward running drop, 
the drop is not really sliding on the surface. The mechanism of the drop’s spreading and 
rolling  up  is  comprised  of  the  motion  of  the  fluid  constituting  the  drop  from  the  bulk 
(center  and  top  of  the  drop)  to  the  drop’s  edge  or,  inversely,  from  the  drop’s  edge 
(bottom) to the bulk (drop center).    
For  example,  if  at  the  beginning  the  drop  has  an 
over-spread shape (solid line in Fig. 8) and tries to 
retract  to  a  less  spread  shape  (dash  line  in  Fig.  8), 
then the profile transition happens by a tearing of its 
edges from the solid and the movement of the bulk 
fluid toward center (shown by the arrows in Fig. 8).   
This process represents a main point of the so-called 
contact angle hysteresis. The stronger the adhesion between liquid and solid, the closer q   
approaches the equilibrium angle q 0, and finally the more viscous the liquid, the slower 
 a thin film appears (similarly to the downward 
such transition takes place.  For 
running  drop)  on  the  surface,  this  film  is  able  to  spread  and  produce  small  droplets 
surrounding the parent drop. The dynamics of such processes and a similar process of the 
drop  rolling  down  an  inclined  surface  has  significant  but  solvable  mathematical 
difficulties. I hope to return to questions related to this topic later.    
In conclusion, we note that the motion of drops or bubbles over a solid can be determined 
not only by the gravitational force or by external pressure. It can involve the inertia forces 
(if, for example, during contact with a solid the drop has a finite velocity in tangential or 
normal directions, as happens for a rain drop), as well as electric forces, and so on. Based 
on  the  previous  considerations,  we  believe  that  it  is  not,  in  principle,  difficult  to 
determine in which cases the drop will preserve its integrity on impact; or when the drop 
will separate into a set of independent droplets; or in which cases the droplets will stay on 
the surface and in which they will bounce up (the spray phenomena), and so forth.

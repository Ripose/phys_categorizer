ABSTRACT

A  mega-tramway  based  on  the  Indonesian  islands  of  Sumatra  and  Java  is  proposed  to  span  Sunda 
Strait.    The  Java-Sumatra  Aerial  Mega-Tramway  (JSAMT)  will  be  self-elevating  and  will  regularly 
and cheaply launch passengers and cargoes via two conveyor belt-like facilities using standard winged 
shipping  containers like  those  currently  used  by  international  trucking  and  ocean  shipping  industries 
that are volplaned across the Sunda Strait.  The JSAMT will be a self-sustaining toll facility free of any 
requirement  for  international  loans  or  funding  guarantees  for  its  construction.    Its  existence  will 
remove  any  immediate  need  for  an  expensive  to  dig/maintain  Nusantara  Tunnel.    We  offer  the 
formative basic technical specifications for the JSAMT and indicate some of the physical and cultural 
geographical  facts  underpinning  our  macro-engineering  proposal;  offshoots  of  a perfected and  tested 
JSAMT may be installed at Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka, the Gibraltar Strait and the Bering 
Strait by mid-21st Century.

1. INTRODUCTION

Sumatra  is  geographically  defined  by  a  3  km-wide  Malacca  Strait  and  a  30  km-wide  Sunda  Strait; 
across  the  Sunda  Strait  is  Java;  further  south  Java  is  defined  by  the  18  km-wide  Lomboc  Strait.  
Approximately  245,000,000  people  are  citizens  of  the  Republic  of  Indonesia;  the  nation’s  capital, 
Jakarta, situated on Java, may have ~21,000,000 residents by 2015.  Jakarta Bay port facilities, which 
constitute a “mega-harbor”1 are being improved at considerably expense.  

Among  the  natural  hazards  affecting  those  persons  living/working  on  Sumatra  and  Java,  tsunamis, 
earthquakes, volcanoes and  annual forest fires  are  most remarkable2.   The 27 August 1883 Krakatoa 
hydro-volcanic explosion and tsunami in the Sunda Strait are famous as is the haze caused by forest 
fires on Sumatra.  During 2002, six of the ten members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
vowed  to  fight  fire pollution  (smoke) in  the  region3.    Further  development  of  comprehensive hazard 
mitigation is vitally necessary to reduce as much as possible the impact of natural and human-caused 
hazards.  The region surrounding the Sunda Strait has a high potential to endure a possibly predictable 
volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatoa (volcanic ash cloud, air shockwaves, tsunami) and strong ground 
motion caused very strong earthquakes; in future, the Sunda Strait also may endure industrial hazards 
emanating from the Merak-Cilegon region and agricultural hazards in the Lampung and Ujung Kulon 
regions, where fallow land cleared for an anticipated season of crop planting, as well as natural forest 
felled and burned to create plantations, is subject to seasonal wildfires.

For these reasons, the authors concur that a Nusantara Tunnel bored beneath the Sunda Strait’s seafloor 
is an inappropriate macroproject for the Republic of Indonesia to undertake at this time4.  As a viable 
alternative,  we  suggest  the  Java-Sumatra  Aerial  Mega-Tramway  (JSAMT)  based,  in  part,  on  the  US 
Patent 6,494,143 awarded to Alexander Alexandrovich Bolonkin on 17 December 2002.  If built, the 
JSAMT will be a truly remarkable 21st Century new kinetic aviation technology extension of the 260 m 
“Transporter Bridge” spanning the River Tyne since 1911 at Middlesbrough in England!  Further, we 
conceive  a cross-Palk Strait  application  of  this  particular  technology  will  very likely  be  commenced 
due  to  the  ongoing  industrialization  of  the  adjacent  regions  and  construction  of  the  Sethusamudram 
Ship Channel in a low-seismicity region5.

2. GROUND AND AERIAL ISLAND LINKAGES 

Indonesia’s  longest  bridge,  commenced  during  2003  and  scheduled  for  completion  by  2008,  is  the 
cable-stayed  Suramadu  Bridge;  it  will  connect  the  island  of  Java  and  the  island  of  Madura  with  a 
modern  high-speed  four-lane  highway.    Soon,  Indonesians  will  experience  the  “zoomscape”—the 
localized human experience of architecture and landscape that has been fundamentally altered by the 
globalization  of  speedy  transportation  technologies6 — and  come  to  appreciate  their  geographical 
surroundings  in  21st  Century  synoptic  apprehensions.    The  islands  of  Indonesia  are  connected  by  a 
network of hundreds of airports but the national highway and railway network remains fragmented; as 
a consequence, the logistics of intra-national commerce is complicated and, sometimes, uneconomical.  
Even  common  inter-modal  standard  shipping  containers — like  those  stacked  by  the  hundreds  at 
Malaysia’s seaports of Tanjung Pelepas and Port Klang — cannot yet be shifted throughout Indonesia 
with  dispatch  or  economy7.    In  other  words,  the  Republic  of  Indonesia’s  future  industrialization 
requires  a  national  policy  encouraging  the  timely  initial  organization  of  a  semi-fixed  aerial  linkage 
capable  of  moving  containerized  people  and  cargoes  over  the  Sunda  Strait  at  low  cost;  the  Java-
Sumatra Aerial Mega-Tramway is a logical, and affordable, kinetic aviation technology to accomplish 
that task within a reasonable period of time.

The  Berlin  Airlift  (27  June  1948  to  12  May  1949)  was  an  extraordinary  first  use  of  a  new  tool  of 
policy, a system  of  transporting supplies  by air  when  ground  routes  (highways, railways  and canals) 
were blockaded8.  Ultimately, about 2.1 million tonnes of supplies were ferried from western Germany 
to isolated Berlin in nearly 139,000 flights to Berlin through inbound routes ranging from 240 km to 
450  km  in  length.    (Weather  forecasting  for  the  two  inbound  routes  and  the  single  outbound  air 
corridor was organized more thoroughly than any aviation operation previously devised.)  What if an 
aerial  mega-tramway  connecting  Berlin  with  a  single  site  in  western  Germany  had  existed  during 
1948-49?  Using calculations developed in SECTION 4, we have an answer for that alternate-history 
postulation:  2.1  millions  metric  ton  of  material  could  have  been  delivered  in  just  52500  standard 
containers  of  40  tons  each  by  two  catapults  (the  first  is  located  in  Berlin  and  the  second  located  in 
West Germany), 10 gliders (+2 in reserve, start weight of each glider is 240 tons) for 440=160 tonnes 
average capacity and flight frequency 0.1 hours (+20 minutes of loading, 16 minutes of flight, and +20 
minutes of unloading), over a much shorter period of time 55 days instead of almost 320 days and 200 
conventional transport  aircraft!  The  Berlin  Airlift  advanced the  logistics  of airpower.   We  think  the 
Java-Sumatra Aerial Mega-Tramway macroproject has the potential to truly revolutionize the Republic 
of  Indonesia’s  industrial  and  commercial  logistics  for  the  suggested  passengers  and  cargo  transfer 
system after installation of universalized connection-disconnection devices atop the standard shipping 
containers9;  JSAMT  will  consist  of  a  40-200  meter-long  cable  path  with  ground-based  engines  that 
propel  standardized  winged  shipping  containers  35  km  across  the  30  km-wide  Sunda  Strait.    The 
distance  across  Palk  Strait  is  about  the  same.    Foreseeably,  such  winged  containers  will  carry 
passengers, with each container having seats, baggage stowage and cabin crew.  While the new Airbus 

2

3
A380 will carry 555 persons, each winged container will likely safely carry about 100 persons so that 
loading/unloading logistics will be far, far simpler and efficient10.

4. JAVA-SUMATRA AERIAL MEGA-TRAMWAY (JSAMT)

An  aerial  tramway  is  a  type  of  aerial  lift  that  uses  comfortable  cabins  carrying  passengers  and  pre-
packaged cargoes; it constitutes the exact opposite of a water-traversing cable ferry that uses barges to 
haul passengers and cargoes across bodies of water even when water currents impose strong transverse 
flow.   Naturally, suspended  aerial tramway  cabins  can be violently  jiggled by  buffeting winds  (head 
winds,  trailing  winds,  tailwinds,  cross  winds).    JSAMT  will  utilize  kinetic  aircraft  to  accelerate  the 
standard weather-tight winged shipping containers to subsonic speed of 250 m/s until its speed decays 
to  a  safe  landing  speed  of  50-60  m/s  on  a  paved  airdrome  on  the  other  side  of  Sunda  Strait.    An 
acceleration  of  3g  will  not  discomfort  passengers  with  normal  health  and  the  paved  airfield  runway 
length actually necessary to bring the winged container to a halt is only about 1.5 km.  The flight path 
spanning the Sunda Strait will still be subject to the vagaries of the weather as well as other naturally 
hazardous  flight  conditions  (Fig.  1a  and  1b).    We  anticipate  a  need  for  the  internationally  approved 
shipping containers—some of which will be loaded with passengers — to  go no higher than 300 m -
500 m altitude above the Sunda Strait.

This  system  for  Aerial  Mega-Tramway—literally,  a  non-fixed  aerial  bridge—includes  (Fig.  1)  a 
closed-loop cable and drive station located on the Earth's surface.  The cable is supported in the air by 
columns equipped with rollers. Each drive station has engines located on the ground and works on any 
cheap energy.  The system works in the  following  way. The subsonic  load  glider (winged  container, 
aircraft)  starts  from  a  small  conventional  area  (40  -200  m,  aerodrome,  railway,  see  Fig.  4),  and  is 
accelerated (with 0.7 -3 g) in air up to a speed of 270–300 m/s (Mach number 0.9) by the drive station 
on the  distance  1–6  km.  The  glider flies (for  distance  30–70  km,  Figs.  2),  gradually loses  speed  and 
increases attack angle of wing. When the speed drops so it is close to landing speed, the glider lands.

For take-off, instead of an aerodrome, a short (40-200 m) railway may be employed (Fig.4). The glider 
can be started from special bogie (trolley) up to speed 50 m/s, take off and then it is accelerated in air 
up  to  a  speed  of  250-300  m/s  (Mach  number  0.9)  by  the  cable.  After  acceleration  the  cable  is 
disconnected and glider free flights.

Mega-Tramway across water. Notation: 1 – closed-loop cable; 2 – Earth's ground; 3 – support column

The flight data are significantly improved if the kinetic aviation vehicle (glider) has variable wing area 
or variable swept wings11. The flight altitude does not influence its range because the energy spent in 
climbing  will  be  returned  in  gliding.    The  Java-Sumatra  Aerial  Mega-Tramway  offers  the  following 
noteworthy advantages:

3

4
(a) the load  capability of kinetic aircraft—standard  shipping containers—increases as a factor of two 
since the winged container has no fuel or engine;
(b) the kinetic aircraft, the attachable/detachable wings, is significantly less expensive than convention 
aircraft with a pressurized cabin (no engines and expensive navigation devices);
(c) the ground-based propulsion engine can operate on the cheapest available fuel;
(d) the maximum flight period is just a few minutes at most.

where R is range [m]; K is  the average aerodynamic  efficiency (K =  10–20 for subsonic  air vehicles 
and K = 5–8 for supersonic air vehicles. For example: the subsonic Boeing-747 has maximum K = 16, 
the recently retired supersonic “Concorde” has maximum K = 7,5, supersonic aircraft XB-70 and YF-
12  have  K  =  7,  and  Boeing  2707-300  has  K =  7.8);  g  =  9.81  m/s2  is  gravity;  V1  is  initial  (after 
acceleration) speed [m/s]; V0  < V1 is final (near landing) speed [m/s] (V0 = 50–60 m/s); V is variable 
speed, V0  < V  < V1 [m/s], mg/K  = D is air  drag  [N];  m is vehicle mass  [kg].  Last  equation in  (1)  is 
obtained from the first equation using integration.  Results of our computations for subsonic (V < 300 
m/s, M < 0.9, M is Mach number) and supersonic (M = 1 - 3) vehicles are presented in Figs. 2 and 3.  
The range of a subsonic vehicle is 45–90 km for V1 = 300 m/s; the range of a supersonic vehicle can 
reach up 400 km for V1 = 1000 m/s.

5. JSAMT Macroproject

Assume  the  mass  of  the  flight  vehicle is  m  =  15  tons  (100  passengers  and  4  members  of  crew);  the 
acceleration is a = 3g (this acceleration is acceptable for untrained people). The range is approximately 
L = 35 km (Sunda Strait, between islands Java and Sumatra as well as Palk Strait between India and Sri 
Lanka)(see Fig. 3 or calculate using Eq. (1) for a final acceleration speed of 250 m/s and K = 14, range 
is 43 km).  The needed acceleration distance is S = 1000 m (Fig. 4). The starting area is only 40 m (Fig. 
3). The time of horizontal acceleration is t = (2S/a)0.5 = 8.2 seconds. The flight time t = 2L/(V1+V0)= 
467 s = 7,8 minutes. Assuming it uses an artificial cheap fiber ( = 600 kg/mm2) widely produced by 
current industry, and a safety tensile strength of the drive vehicle cable is = 180 kg/mm2 (the safety 
factor is 600/180 = 3.33), density  = 1800 kg/m3 (K1 = 180/1800 = 0.1). Then the cross-section area of 
the vehicle cable around the vehicle will be S1 = 3m/  = 250 mm2, and the cable diameter is d = 18 
mm. The mass of the cable is M = S1Ld   = 450 kg. Here Ld   = 1000 m is the maximum length of the 
drive cable. 

The energy required for acceleration of the aircraft and the cable is E = mV2/2. This is about E = 47 
Mega Joules (1 Mega Joule = 106 J) if V = 250 m/s. The drag of the aircraft and cable is about D = 3 
7

8
tons, which means E = DL = 3.104.1,000 =39 Mega Joules. If the launches are made launches are made 
every 0.1 hours and the ground-based engines must have a total power of about P = E/t = 30.106/6/60 = 
83 kW.  If the engine efficiency is = 0.3 the fuel consumption will be F = E//= 39.106//0.3 = 3.1 
kg per flight. Here  = 42.106 [J/kg] is the energy capability of diesel fuel. This means that 0.031 kg of 
fuel is used for each passenger. 

If  tensile  strength  is   =  180  kg/mm2  =  1.8.109  N/m2,   =  1800  kg/m3,  then  the  total  weight  of  the 
flywheels (as storage energy) will be about Mw = 2E/  = 2.47.106.1800/1.8.109 = 94 kg. 

Assume a cost of twenty million 2006 USA dollars for the installation, a lifetime of 20 years, and an 
annual maintenance cost of one million dollars. If 100 passengers are launched on every flight, there
are  10  flights  every  hour  for  350  days  a  year  and  the  load  coefficient  is  0.75,  then  N  = 
2100×10×24×350×0.75  =  12,600,000  passengers  will  be  launched  per  year.  The  launch  cost  per 
passenger is $2,000,000/12,600,000 = $0.16 plus fuel cost. If 0.031 kg of fuel is used for 1 passenger 
and  the  liquid  fuel  price  is  $0.5  per  kg,  then  the  cost  is  $0.016/person  for  liquid  fuel.  The  total 
production  cost  will  be  about  $0.18/person.  If  each  ticket  costs  but  one  USA  dollar  then  the  profit 
could be 10.3 millions dollars annually. The efficiency will be improved when the glider can take 200 
and more passengers. For this short distance five (four working + one in reserve) gliders are enough.  
Fuel prices change with time, but in any case the cost of delivery will be sometimes less than delivery 
by  conventional  aircraft.  The  delivery  time  is  less  than  any  city  transportation  (bus,  railway  or 
subway)!

6. OTHER MACROPROJECT FACTORS

The public image of the JSAMT is at least as important as the macroproject’s management during its 
physical creation12.  Considering that the JSAMT is a novel freight and passenger moving innovation, 
some serious research must be undertaken in order to artfully craft a favorable public image of JSAMT 
that will enlighten and attract the public in the Republic of Indonesia.  For example, many Indonesians 
will find computer simulations of a trip across the Sunda Strait aboard the winged containers too much 
“zoomscape”,  perhaps  even  frightening.    JSAMT  will  be  a  pioneering  new  technology  that  must  be 
presented  locally  both  as  a  patented  invention  familiar  enough  not  to  alarm  people  and  innovative 
enough  so  as  not  to  seem  too  unfamiliar!  One  of  the  world’s  tallest  office  buildings,  the  Petronas 
Towers in Kuala Lumpur, has excited the public of Malaysia since 1996.  So, public relations image 
managers  will  need  to  tune  their  public  regional  and  global  presentations  to  investors,  government 
authorities and future JSAMT users carefully, taking into account all likely negative reactions.  

The development of spacious well-lit and  secure container storage  yards  at both ends of the JSAMT 
will require cooperation at many levels of government.  There will be no need for transit sheds on Java 
or Sumatra since the standard shipping container is weather-tight and functions as a mobile warehouse.  
Refrigerated  containers  will  require  a  reliable  source  of  electricity.    We  view  JSAMT  as  a 
unified/unitary transportation kinetic aviation system cooperating with railroad operators and truckers 
that has the potential to provide fixed linkages amongst, at least, the  main islands of the Republic of 
Indonesia.  JSAMT could reduce ship traffic in congested sea-lanes (Malacca Strait, Lomboc Strait and 
Sunda Strait) and help  shippers avoid pirates plaguing  slow-moving  high-value cargo vessels.   Once 
the  JSAMT  has  been  perfected,  it  may  become  adaptable  to  other  Earth-surface  sites  such  as  the 
Bering Strait or Gibraltar Strait.  At Palk Strait, the Aerial Mega-Tramway could lessen the ship traffic 
environmental impacts on Palk Bay.
  The other projects are in 13- 18.

A  study  of  band  edge  phenomena  in  ridge  waveguide  magnetophotonic  crystals  is  presented.    Normal  mode 
analysis is used to examine the near-band edge and Bragg center-wavelength group velocities and their relation to 
the  polarization.    Large  polarization  departures  from  the  input  are  observed  in  Bragg  gratings  patterned  by 
focused-ion-beam milling on liquid-phase-epitaxial (LPE) (Bi,Lu)(2.8 ± 0.1)Fe(4.6 ± 0.2)O(12.4 ± 0.3) films on (111) gadolinium 
gallium garnet (GGG) substrates. Transfer matrix analysis of the spectral response in the photonic crystals allows 
the  determination  of  the  phase  of  the  elliptically  polarized  normal  modes  from  measured  transmittances  and 
polarization  rotation.    Unlike  non-birefringent  Faraday  rotators  a  non-linear-relation  exists  between  polarization 
rotation and the normal mode phase difference. Large phase differences between right- and left-elliptically polarized 
normal modes and optical slow-down are found near the band edges and at the resonant cavity center-wavelength. 
Standing-wave photon trapping and optical slow-down are analyzed and compared for these systems.

1. Introduction 

Band  edge  effects  and  resonant  phenomena  in 
magnetophotonic  photonic  crystals  are  of 
interest 
because  of  their  influence  on  polarization  and  speed  of 
light  control,  of  significant  import  in  signal  processing. 
Such  structures  may  lead  to  magnetically  tunable 
optical delay lines and optical buffers for signal routing 
or data storage.

The  study  of  photonic  crystal  effects  in  magnetic

In  this  article  we  present  a  study  of  band  edge

crystals  as  they  relate  to  the  manipulation  of  optical 
phases  and  speeds.    Normal  mode  analysis  is  used  to 
understand  the  effect  of  near-band  edge  group  velocity 
on  the  polarization.    Large  polarization  departures 
from the input are observed and their relation to normal 
mode  speed  modifications  is  addressed.  Bragg  gratings

30kV  gallium  ions  are  used  to  pattern  the  photonic

Linear-birefringence  in  the  slab  is  measured  at  0.0006,

6μm-wide  800nm-high  ridges  fabricated  by  standard 
photolithography  and  dry-etching  form  the  optical 
channels.    Overall  ridge  waveguide  lengths  are  1.18

optical wavelength in vacuum, Λ the grating period, and 
nf and nb are the modal effective indices of the forward

stress that the effect under discussion is not high-order 
Bragg  scattering  which  occurs  well  outside  the  optical 
wavelength range under study but inter-modal coupling 
between different waveguide modes. Of especial interest 
is the strong coupling and large rotations that occur for 
fundamental forward to high-order backscattered modes 
in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. These effects have been discussed in 
detail  in  a  prior  publication  [16]  and  stem  from  an 
enhancement  in  the  grating  coupling  strength  for 
high-order mode backscattering.

of a polarization analyzer at the output end. Thus x0, y0, 
and  θ  are  directly  measurable  quantities.  The  phase 
difference between the outgoing elliptical normal modes

The  large  changes  in  polarization  direction  in  the 
stop  bands  noted  above  can  be  understood  in  terms  of 
accrued phase differences between normal modes in the 
optical  guide.  This,  of  course,  is  also  the  origin  of  the 
Faraday rotation in bulk magneto-optic systems, where 
the  normal  modes  of  propagation  are  circularly 
polarized  waves  with  opposite  sense  of  rotation 
traveling  at  different  speeds.  For  magnetophotonic 
optical  waveguide  channels  the  normal  modes  become 
elliptically-polarized  waves  having  opposite  sense  of 
rotation.[15] 

The  ratio  between  semi-major  and  semi-minor 
components  in  the  magnetophotonic  crystal  normal 
modes is:[15]

For elliptical normal modes, the relation between 
the polarization rotation angle θ and the phase angle 
difference Δζ is given by Eqs. (2) and (3). Large phase 
variations around the stop band result from the 
photonic bandgap structure.    These are plotted in Fig. 
4.    The figure displays Δζ obtained from the measured 
transmittance and polarization rotation in Fig. 3(b) 
using the formulation presented in this section.    We 
also plot the result of a theoretical calculation of the 
phase for the same magnetophotonic crystal based on a 
transfer matrix formulation that treats the bandgap 
structure as a quarter-waveplate stack. Good agreement 
is seen with the experimental data.[7,8,15] The transfer 
matrix formulation is discussed in section 3.2, below.   
It should be noted that one can reconstruct the 
polarization rotation angle θ from the normal-mode 
transmittance-phases ζ+ and ζ−.[15] Figure 5 shows the 
calculated rotation angle for the first-order mode 
backscattering under examination.    Very good 
agreement is obtained with the measured polarization 
rotation in Fig. 3 for both cases, with and without phase 
shift step.  However, it is clear that the relation between 
the normal-mode phase difference Δζ and the resulting 
polarization rotation is no longer a linear relation as 
was the case for a birefringence-free system (Eq. (6)).   
An analysis of the kind presented in this section is 
required.   
 
3.2  Elliptical  normal-mode  phases  and  group 
velocities 

In  examining  the  accumulated  phases  and  the 
speed  of  propagation  of  the  optical  waves  in  the 
magnetophotonic crystals under study it is important to 
consider  the  normal  modes  separately.    Each  normal 
mode has a well-defined albeit different refractive index 
and  each  propagates  at  a  different  speed  in  the 
waveguide.    In  section  3.1  we  analyzed  the  relation 
between  normal  mode  phase  differences 
and 
  We  also  verified  that  the

analysis  reproduces  the  measured  polarization  rotation 
in  the  stop  bands.  In  this  section  we  elaborate  on  the 
transfer  matrix  model  and  proceed  to  evaluate  the 
spectral  dependence  of  the  speed  and  phase  for  each  of 

the normal modes using this model.     

In  the  transfer-matrix  formulation  the  crystal  is 
treated as a layered structure composed of quarter-wave 
thick  plates.[7,8]  The  dielectric-tensor  diagonal 
elements  control  the  waveguide  mode  birefringence.   
Index contrast is modeled through the relative strength 
of the diagonal elements in adjacent layers, but keeping 
the overall birefringence uniform throughout the crystal 
along  the  propagation  direction.  This 
is  a  good 
approximation for the waveguides under study.

Once  the  equivalent  layered  structure  has  been 
determined  this  way,  the  normal  mode  characteristics, 
including  normal  mode  output  phases ζ±  are  extracted 
from  the  model.  The  polarization  rotations  in  Fig.  5, 
computed on the  basis  of  this  transfer-matrix  approach 
compare  well  with  the  experimental  results  and  lend

Bendickson et. al.  have  proposed  a  formulation  for 
the  group  velocity  in  a  photonic  crystal  by  defining  an 
effective  wave  number k  equal  to 
dζ , where ζ  is  the 
total  accumulated  phase  as  the 
light  propagates 
through the structure and d is the physical thickness of 
the same.[17] The group velocity of a propagating wave 
is then defined using the standard form

quarter-wave-plate stack photonic crystal, as long as the 
birefringence  is  uniform  across  the  whole  stack.    We

substrates. Fundamental to first-order mode coupling in 
photonic  crystals  with  and  without  resonant  cavity

presented  that  relates  the  polarization  response  to 
normal  mode

retardation  in  these  magnetophotonic  crystals.  This 
analysis  yields  evidence  of  optical  slow-down  at  the 
Bragg  resonance  center-wavelength  for  resonant  cavity 
steps  to  one-half  the  speed  of  light  in  the  original 
dielectric  medium.  In  contrast,  significant  speed-up  is 
found in the Bragg grating without phase-shift step.

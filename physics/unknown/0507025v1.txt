Abstract 
 
In  order  to  compare  the  ratios  between  the  amplitudes  of  P  and  S  acoustic  waves 
drawn from various boreholes, we have defined a specific wave parameter called magnitude  : 
for each shot, we have added the maximum positive amplitude values and the absolute values 
of the minimum negative amplitudes of a given wave recorded at different depths. 

In compact formations, the difference between the logarithms of the magnitudes of S 
and  P  waves  provides  a  value  that  appears  to  be  characteristic  of  the  state  of  stress  of  the 
domain where a borehole is drilled. Accidents between those formations, such as fractures or 
sedimentary joints can be determined, and breakouts well distinguished.

Introduction 
The  variation  of  the  amplitudes  of  the  acoustic  waveforms  propagating  through  a 
 
borehole  has  been  taken  into  consideration  for  several  decades  in  order  to  locate  open 
fractures and estimate porosity. Stoneley waves supply good information for the first case and 
body  waves  for  the  second  one.  However,  the  quantitative  comparison  between  the 
simultaneous amplitude variations of P and S waves is not a usual parameter. 
 
In fact, it is mainly the apparent difficulty to obtain P waves of sufficient amplitudes in 
acoustic  logs  of  some  boreholes  through  basalts  which  questions  the  mechanisms  of 
propagation.  A  series  of  articles  was  edited  by  Williamson  (2003)  concerning  the  seismic 
imaging  problems  of  the  sub-basalt  sequences,  but  the  wave  frequencies  in  both  techniques 
(reflection  seismic  and  acoustic  logging)  are  not  of  the  same  order  (10  Hz  /  20  kHz).  This 
paper proposes to calculate the ratios between the amplitudes of P and S waves around several 
deep  boreholes  and  to  compare  the  results  between  them  in  relation  to  the  local  geological 
environment. This work makes sense only in the case of solid formations.

Protocol followed to calculate the "magnitudes" of the P and S waves 
 
Eight or two receivers of sonic monopole probes provide the data, that is to say there 
are  eight  or  two  waveforms  recorded  for  each  shot.  For  each  wave  at  each  depth,  we  have 
added the maximum positive amplitude value and the absolute value of the minimum negative 
amplitude. The sum of the eight or two such values for a given wave characterizes what we 
call the wave magnitude at the given depth (Figure 1). 
 
As  the  aim  of  this  calculation  is  the  comparison  between  the  results  from  different 
boreholes,  the  question  of  the  dynamics  of  the  signals  arises,  and  it  cannot  be  directly 
resolved.  When  a  resonance  occurs  (see  Rousseau,  2005a),  the  calculated  magnitude  may 
reflect  a  parameter  different  from  the  case  without  resonance.  Finally,  one  must  remember 
that open fractures decrease the amplitudes of body waves, as well as those of surface waves 
(Rousseau and Jeantet, 1997). 
 
On  the  other  hand,  as we  take into consideration only solid formations in this work, 
and  thanks  to  large  transmitter-receiver  distances  (more  than  3  meters),  one  can  easily 
separate  automatically  P  and  S  waves  from  their  respective  velocities.  However,  it  is  very 
difficult  to  separate  S  waves  from  their  corresponding  surface  waves,  the  pseudo-Rayleigh 
waves  that  are  dispersive  and  arrive  between  the  S  and  direct  waves.  However,  their 
maximum amplitudes are often similar. 
The  use  of  the  logarithm  of  the  so-called  magnitudes  allows  us  (i)  to  be  free  of  the 
 
signal dynamics in order to compare the P and S waves of the waveforms at each depth, and 
(ii)  to  smooth  the  variations  of  the  results,  particularly  in  the  case  of  S  waves.  So  the 
difference  between  the  logarithm  of  S  wave  magnitude  (called  Sw)  and  the  logarithm  of  P 
wave magnitude (called Pw), which is a ratio, will be the parameter chosen for the comparison 
between different wells. This parameter is characteristic for a given frequency because it does 
not depend on signal processing nor data acquisition conditions.

Analysis of the results 
 
Plate  I  displays  the  logarithms  of  the  P  wave  and  of  the  S  wave  magnitudes,  called 
respectively  Pw  and  Sw,  with  their  differences  called  Sw  –  Pw,  for  all  the  mentioned 
boreholes with a diagram for each run. The logarithms of the Stoneley wave magnitudes are 
plotted for information. The results can be examined under two main approaches : 1) compact 
formations, and 2) fractures or joints between compacts formations. 
 

a)  within compact formations

The  mean  values  of  Sw  -  Pw  vary  only  slightly  between  "accidents"  which  generally 

cause decreases (see next section). These values are indicated below. 
•  For the KTB Pilot Hole : from 2.0 at 4000 meters of depth up to 3.0 at 890 meters ; as the 
well  crossed  a  sub  vertical  fracture  near  the  surface,  the  low  values  from  the  runs 
KTB_P 1 and KTB_P 4 are not reliable for characterizing compact formations. 

•  For the GPK1 borehole (Soultz sous forêt) : from 2.5 at 3500 meters of depth to 3.8 at 

2200 meters. 

•  For the SAFOD Pilot Hole : from 1.5 at 800 meters of depth to 2.0 at 2100 meters. 
•  For  the  Auriat  borehole  :  from  2.5  to  3.0  between  900  and  540  meters  of  depth.  The 

respective offsets are 3.20 and 5.68 meters for the small and great size tools. 

•  For the ANDRA boreholes :  

•  CHA106 : from 0.5 at 180 meters of depth to 1.0 at 550 meters, 
•  CHA105 : between 1.5 and 2.0 from 210 to 350 meters of depth, 
•  CHA112 : 1.75 at 180 meters of depth to 2.0 at 570 meters. 

•  For the Balazuc1 borehole : 1.4-1.5 between 1700 meters of depth and 600 meters, with a 

passage up to 2.75 between 1000 and 650 meters. 

•  For the ODP Hole 735b : 3.4 between 100 and 580 meters of depth. 
•  For the ODP Hole 1137A : 2.0 between 230 and 350 meters of depth. The weak values, 
here not representative, are consecutive to tool vibrations or sedimentary "joints" between 
basalts. 

Figure 2 recapitulates the values of Sw-Pw. We observe that the wells drilled within 
known stress domains are spread out so that those in a tensile domain – the Soultz borehole 
(Cornet  et  al,  1997;  Genter  et  al,  1997;  Klee  and  Rummel,  1999)  and  the  KTB  Pilot  Hole 
(Bücher  et  al,  1990;  Zang  et  al,  1990;  Roeckel  and  Natau,  1993;  Rousseau,  2005a)  – 
correspond  to  larger  values  than  this  in  a  compressive  and  shear  domain  –  the  SAFOD 
borehole  (Boness  and  Zoback,  2004;  Chéry  et  al,  2004;  Korneev  et  al,  2003;  Townend  and 
Zoback, 2004; Rousseau, 2005b). 

  The  position  of  the  Auriat  borehole  indicates  a  low  stress  domain  within  the  French 
Massif Central, while the lowest values of Sw-Pw of the Balazuc1 borehole tend to belong to 
a stressed domain in the Cevennes Massif. The dashed line in Figure 2 indicates higher values 
probably  due  to  a  resonance  of  the  S  waves  propagating  within  calcarenites.  Thus,  those 
values should represent this kind of sedimentary formation rather than the local stress. As for 
the  ANDRA  boreholes  in  the  much  fractured  Vienne  region  in  France  (Gros  and  Genter, 
1999),  the  low values of Sw-Pw clearly suggest a stressed domain, which had already been 
deduced by the author (Rousseau, 2005a). Resonance of P waves might cause the very weak 
Sw-Pw  values  of  CHA106,  unless  the  juxtaposition  of  two  stressed  domains  of  unequal 
magnitude might produce the differences of the Sw-Pw values between CHA106 on the one 
hand,  and  CHA105  and  CHA112  on  the  other  hand,  although  the  distance  between  them  is 
small (less than 2 km). In that case, this area might be the location of a future rupture. 
 
In  this  frame,  the  locations  of  our  ODP  wells  relative  to  the  Sw-Pw  values  are 
interesting :  the  Hole  737b  drilled  over  the  Indian  rift  is  characteristic  of  a  tensile  domain, 
while  the  Hole  1137A  drilled  within  the  Kerguelen  Plateau  is  in  an  intermediate  position, 
between tension and compression. 
 
When  the  vertical  logged  segment  of  a  well  is  long  enough,  we  can  observe  some 
variations of the Sw-Pw values. We have noted the influence of some sedimentary formations, 
such  as  calcarenites  in  the  Balazuc1  borehole,  but  we  observe  monotonic  variations  with 
depth in crystalline formations. The Sw-Pw values decrease with depth in the KTB Pilot Hole 
and the Soultz borehole, while they increase in the SAFOD Pilot Hole. In the first case, the 
stress would increase with depth, and in the second case, the stress would decrease.

b)  case of fractures or joints between compact formations 
Fractures and joints reveal a decreasing of Sw, sometimes simultaneously with Pw. In the 
diagrams  of  the  Plate  I,  we  have  plotted  the  logarithm  of  the  corresponding  Stoneley  wave 
magnitudes Stw for information. 

In the case of an open fracture, we observe that Sw, Pw and Stw decrease simultaneously. 
It  is  the  only  case  of  Stw  decreasing.  If  Sw  decreases,  but  Stw  does  not,  while  Pw  may 
sometimes increases simultaneously because of resonance, the occurrence of breakouts may 
cause  this  phenomenon.  It  is  particularly  the  case  in  the  KTB  Pilot  Hole  (see  Kück,  1993). 
Sedimentary  joints,  as  those  in  the  ODP  Hole  1137A,  cause  a  resonance,  inferring  the 
increasing of Pw. Finally, Pw and Sw may increase because either friction of the tool against 
the hole wall (case in the Balazuc1 borehole) or resonance of the tool itself (it is perhaps the 
case in the ODP Hole 1137A). It is unusual to observe only Pw decreasing. 
 
Discussion and conclusion 
In the  case of compact and no porous formations, the  study of the ratio between the 
 
maximum values of the amplitudes of each acoustic body waves shows that this ratio is not a 
tool parameter, but the consequence of an environmental parameter. The examples of various 
geological regions allow us to determine it as the in situ stress. In this case, the values Sw-Pw 
ought to be used as a scale representative of the kind of stress domain : the lower they are, the 
higher the stress  is. The shear and compressed domains correspond to values around 1, and 
the very weak stress domains to values up to 3.5. 
The  simultaneous  variations  of  the  values  Sw,  Pw  and  Stw  provide  invaluable 
 
information about the "accidents" affecting those formations, such as fractures or all kinds of 
joints. In addition to usual well images, we have an easy means to distinguish breakouts from 
fractures. The vertical axial position of those induced cracks causes the resonance of P waves, 
but the attenuation of S waves. 
 
The physical interpretation of those results is that S waves vibrate as less as stress is 
great.  The  value  Sw-Pw  represents  therefore  a  kind  of  freedom  degree  of  the  transversal 
vibration of S waves, characteristic of the crossed formation.

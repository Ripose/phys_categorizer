Abstract
The author researched this new idea – support of flight by any aerial vehicles at significant altitude 
solely by the magnetic field of the planet. It is shown that current technology allows humans to 
create a light propulsion (AB engine) which does not depend on air, water or ground terrain. 
Simultaniosly, this revolutionary thruster is a device for the storage of electricity which is extracted 
and is replenished (during braking) from/into the storage with 100% efficiency. The relative weight 
ratio of this engine is 0.01 - 0.1 (from thrust). For some types of AB engine (toroidal form) the 
thrust easily may be changed in any direction without turning of engine. 
  The author computed many projects using different versions of offered AB engine: small device 
for levitation-flight of a human (including flight from Earth to Outer Space), fly VTOL car (track), 
big VTOL aircrat, suspended low altitude stationary satellite, powerful Space Shuttle-like booster 
for travel to the Moon and Mars without spending energy (spended energy is replenished in braking 
when ship returns from other planet to its point of origin), using AB-devices in military, in sea-
going ships (submarimes), in energy industry (for example. as small storage of electric energy) and 
so on. The vehicles equipped with AB propulsion can take flight for days and cover distances of 
tens thousands of kilometers at hypersonic or extra-atmosphere space speeds.
  The work contains tens of inventions and innovations which solves problems and breaks 
limitations which appear in solution of these very complex revolutionary ideas.

Introduction
  Free flight in the atmosphere as by birds was the ancient dream of people without aircraft. During 
1964, the author developed his first gravity control theory [1]. The first realistic method for 
electrostatic levitation was offered and theoretically developed in report [2] and published in [3] 
Ch.15.
  However, the electrostatic levitation is possible only along special electrostatic lines. Man (car, 
track) cannot fly in any direction and to any place in the Earth.  Riding a vehicle with air engine 
(propeller or rocket) for thrust, such persons cannot even imagine or feel himself as being like a 
bird.
  The offered new revolutionary method does not have these defects. It allows flight in any 
direction in Earth's using the internal electricity storage. It does not depend on the environment of 
air, water, ground and does not pollute regions or the planet in any way. It can operate in vacuum, 
in the outer space surrounding any planet (space body) having a natural or artificial magnetic field 
(Earth, Mars’ moon Phobos, Saturn, Magnetic Stars, White Dwarf, etc.). That can change the thrust 
direction without turning of the engine, levitate without expending energy. That spends energy only 
for lifting and to overcome air drag, but lifting energy is returning when the apparatus descends. 
We do not lose energy if we flight in space or at planet not having an atmosphere and return to the 
initial take-off place. We can free flight to Moon or Mars without loss of the summary energy from 
a Low Earth's Orbit if a space apparatus has a same weight. Energy spended for the acceleration of 
apparatus will be returned when apparatus is braking.
  This work contains conventional sections: 1. The short description of the offered AB levitator 
(that also may be used as friendly environmental electric car and other vihicle engine), its works; 2) 
Theory of innovation, and 3) Projects estimations. The first and third expositive sections are 
destined for non-specialist readers, the second part - for specialists.

Brief description of new revolutionary innovention.
  The offered method embraces tens inventions and innovations: magnetic devices, 
superconductivity devices, electricity storage, compensation of magnetic forces, use of strong 
matters, defence from magnetic field, concentration of magnetic field, increasing of magnetic 
intensity, cooling systems, in protection from space radiation, special design of magnetic and 
cooling devices, and many others. Some of them are briefly described below.
  1. Note from theory. It is well-known from physics when the conductor is moved in magnetic 
field that has an electromagnetic force and voltage between its ends. This force is computed by 
equation:

[ BldiFd 

where small vector  Fd  is force (in Newtons) of small element 
ld of vector wire (in meters);  B  is 
intensity of the magnetic field, in Teslas; i is electric currency, in Ampers. Square brackets [ ] note 
a vector production. 
   For straight wire the equation (1) can be written in form

where F is force, N; i is electric currency, A; l is wire length, m; B is magnetic field strength, T; Bn
is projection vector  B on perpendicular to plate contains the vectors  Bl ,
may be found by left hand rule: if magnetic lines enter into the human hand’s palm, the fingers 
show the direction of electric currency, then the pollex shows the direction of magnetic force.
  The electric tension (voltage), U, is computed by equations

where v is wire speed, m/s.
 The force acts to the conductor and does not depend on wire speed. That explains why our devices 
can levite without movement.
  The equations (1)-(2) allow easy computation of the force and voltage of conductor in magnetic 
field. However, if we estimate the force in Earth's magnetic field, this force is very small. The 
Earth's magnetic field strength in a middle latitude equals about B  3.410-5  T.  If the conductor 
has the currency i = 10 A and length l = 1 m, the force will be only F = 3.410-4 N.  That very 
small force is enough for moving a compass needle, but not enough for moving a larger apparatus 
or for flight apparatus. 
   2. Design and work of AB levitator, engine and electric storage. Author offers to overcome 
this difficulty by use of superconductivity, which allows a big currency up 105 A/mm2 and more. 
That means that one meter from superconductivity wire having cross-section area 3 cm2 and mass 
4.8 kg can create a force of about 2000 N. But superconductivity calls to mind two other main 
problems: the low temperature of superconductivity and a limited maximum self-magnetic field 
that destroys the wire’s superconductibity.
  These new problems we will consider later. Now, we consider the main principal difficulty: the 
Maxwell law says: in any closed loop electric circuit (without internal conductor) the total force 
(and electric intensity for constant magnetic flow) equals zero. That means the back conductor 
(Fig.1a) creates the same opposed force F and total force will be zero. The author offers the 
innovation which permits avoidance of this obstacle: to  protect a back wire from Earth's 
magnetic field (Fig.1b). It is known, an iron (or other good magnetic) cover adsorbs the magnetic 
lines (fig.1c)  (see textbook "Electricity" by S.G. Kalashnikov, 1985, p. 219, fig. 167, Russian). The 
back wire inserted into the iron cover and insulated from it (Fig.1b).

offered AB device that creates force in the magnetic field. (a) Conventional electric circuit in the 
magnetic field. We have two opposed magnetic force F. (b) Electric circuit which has the back 
conductor protected from Earth's magnetic field. We have one force. (c) Magnetic lines flow around the 
back conductor. Direct exposure shield protects the back electric wire from Earth's magnetic field 
(cross-section of back wire 3 in "c").

          Notations: 1 - closed loop wire, 2 - electric insulator, 3 - protection (shield) from outer magnetic field 

(for example, iron, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, etc.), 4 - lines of magnetic field, F - force, i - electric 
currency, B - magnetic field strength.

  That idea is used for AB thruster and AB levitator (Fig.2). The author offers two main forms of 
these devices: cylindrical form (long or shirt cylinder) and toroidal form. Naturally, each of them 
has advantages and disadvantages. The cylindrical form is shown in Fig. 2. 
  The cylindrical AB thruster has closed loop superconductivity wires 4-6 (Fig. 2) inserted into 
strong composed insulator 5 (that stuff is composed from strong fibers or whiskers). That is also 
important innovation because insulator perceives the gigantic magnetic tensile forces from 
superconductive wires. The safety force very strong depends from this insulator. The insulator is 
also stores the electric energy. The amount of stored energy depends from an insulator’s strength. 
Strong artificial fibers, whiskers, and nanotubes are preferable as the insulator (stuff). The known 
(for example, toroidal) superconductor electric storage has empty core. That needs in a strong 
heavy cover and cannot have a strong internal magnetic field. The design offered connects the 
straight and back wires 4, 6 in one body by the insulator and allows reaching a very strong 
magnetic field between wires 4 and 6 (see computation). The strong insulator also supports the 
superconductivity wire 4, 6 because superconductivity material has usually a small strength. The 
superconductive layer 11 is connected with wires 4. It is known that external magnetic field cannot 
penetrate the superconductive material more than 10-5 cm. The layer 11 accepts the Earth's
magnetic field, passes voltage to the upper wire 4 and protects the top side of the lower back wire 6 
from influence the Earth's magnetic field.  The face plates 7 (or special internal cylinder made from 
thin ferro-magnetic (iron) material) also protects the internal side of the back wires 7 from Earth's 
magnetic field.
  The levitator has channels 4 where the liquid refrigerant (for example, nitrogen) circulates by a 
pump 9. The levitator has an innovative heat protection: multi-screens vacuum prism mirror offered 
by author in [3] Chs.3A, 12. The loss of refrigerant by leakage is small (see computation) and 
unimportant to operation. In outer space the levitator is protected from Sun and Earth radiations by 
the same multi-screens protector and does not need liquid refrigerant and special cooling system.  

 The mobile sections 10 (from thin iron (ferro-magnetic), circle and semi-circle) allows defense of 
part of the outer cylindrical surface from Earth's magnetic field and change (move) position and 
value of levitation force. The charging and discharging of the electricity storage feature (insulator 
between wires 4 - 6) makes inductor 8 or special outer magnetic field. We do not spend energy 
when the levitator levitates or moves in horizontal direction. The energy in storage is automatically 
spent (or replenished) when apparatus is lifting (descent), is accelerated (braking), or having 
movement drag (air and friction drag). That way we can free (without spending of total energy) 
travel in space or non-atmospheric planet if we will return at previous place and doesn't change the 
final weight.  That capability doesn't have any known engines. The efficiency of offered electricity 
storage is 100% and energy saved for an unlimited time period.

field, 8 - charge and discharge device, 9 - pump for liquid refrigerant, 10 - mobile protections of 
device parts from Earth's magnetic field (for control value and direction of the levitation (thrust) 
force), 11 - superconductive thin layer connected to wires 4. That protects the wires 6 from Earth's 
magnetic field.  

  The cylindrical levitator may be short (Fig.2) or has a thin envelope. This form is more suitable for air 

vehicles.

  The AB levitetor can have a toroidal form (Fig. 3). This form may be better for plate flight 
vehicles.

wires, 7 - strong material, 8 - protection from Earth's magnetic field and mobile control of value and 
direction of levitate force.

    3. Control of AB levitator. The guidence and control of the levitating apparatis is easily 
accomplished. The control of the levitation force (value and direction) is presented in Fig. 4. We 
can slope the levitative force F in any direction, to get a projection of this force to horizotal plate 
and move in any horizontal direction (without turning of apparatus!). Expecially that is comfortable 
for toroidal levitator (Fig.4h). We can also turn the apparatus around any axis. Our apparatus is 
neutral, but one can be stabilized quickly by the simplest gyroscopical device.
    Our apparatus may be used for ground, sea ship, submarine vehicles as engine (thruster) and 
storage of electric energy. 
   The problem can be only apparent when we have cylindrical motionless thruster-levitator. When 
we move in West-East or East-West directions, we have full force F. When we move South-North 
(or back) and the main direction of an electric currency in thruster  is same as the direction of the 
Earth's magnetic lines, the force F may be closed to zero (see eq. (1)). More exactly, a butt-end of 
the levitate cylinder crosses the magnetic lines and produce the force, but usually the butt-end area 
is significantly less than the side area of the cylinder and this force is small. Only toroidal levitator 
has same l in any direction. This defect may be corrected by many means. For example, the AB 
engine is turning and have West-East direction for any speed direction of vehicle; the vehicle has 
ferro-magnetic antennas (which change the local direction of the Earth's magnetic lines, Fig.4h)., 
the vehicle has zig-zag way, and so on. The toroidal thruster (Fig. 3) does not have this problem.

near levitator and produce force when the levitator moves along the lines of Earth's magnetic field. (g) 
The opposed slope of two connected cylinders create the moment around axis z. (h) Toroidal levitator. 
The closing of different parts of toroid create the different forces in these parts. That allows creating 
the slope of apparatus and horizontal force in any direction (include the value of the force).

4. Ferro-magnetic concentrator of outside magnetic lines. This innovation may be very useful.  
Ferro-magnetic matter collects the magnetic lines (magnetic field, magnetic flow). The 
electromagnetic induction is

0
where B is magnetic induction in T,  is magnetic permeability  (in vacuum  = 1), 0 = 410-7  is 
magnetic constant in N/A2, H is magnetic induction in A/m. 
  Magnetic induction at the Earth's magnetic equator is 27.1 A/m. The maximum magnetic 
permeability are: for iron  = 6100. for the steel Э 310  = 36,000 at H = 9.6 A/m  (maximum B = 
1.75 T); for permalloy (having 78.5 Ni)  = 100,000 at H = 2 A/m, (Bmax = 0.8). For iron (having 
4.3% Si) B = 0.45 T at H = 40 A/m.
  In case of a correct design the permeability can increase magnetic field by hundreds or thousands 
of times. It is used in ferro-magnetic antennas in small radio receivers. That also may be used in 
AB levitator, thruster, and engine for increasing the propulsion force. It is very important that the 
ferro-magnetic changes the direction of the magnetic lines near itself. The radius of collection 
(when magnetic wire is parallel to magnetic lines) equals approximately a length of the wire. The 
typical levitator with magnetic booster is shown in Fig. 5. However, ferromagnetic method still 
needs more thorough, detailed investigation.

magnetic circuit, 3 - levitator, 4 - magnetic lines, 5 - electric currency.

   5. Cooling system.  Fig. 6 shows some innovative methods of protection for the AB levitator in 
outer space (in vacuum). The simplest protection is a super reflective mirror (Fig. 6a) offered by 
author in 1988 (see [3] Chs. 12, 3A). The superreflectivity screen-mirror gives deep cooling. The 
usual high reflectivity screen-mirror gives enough cooling (Fig. 6b). The usual multi-screens 
protection also gives enough cooling (Fig. 6c)(see the computation in Theoretical Section). The 
Earth's atmospheric levitator needs liquified nitrogen (or cheaper liquid air, oxygen) cooling 
system, but by using the super reflectivity multi-screen protection we have a very small heat flow 
and need very small amount of liquid nitrogen.

radiation, 6 - Earth (planet); 7 - Earth's radiation.  

  6. Magnetic safety for Human life. The intensity of magnetic field used by the levitator is very 
high up 60 - 180 T. Is this dangerous for human health? My answer: if we have the correct design, 
the offered levitator contains all magnetic field inside the levitator (Fig. 7). Outside of the levitator 
the magnetic field equals zero!
  When the levitator design is correct, the magnetic field 6 from the internal (lower) circuit equals 
and opposed the magnetic field 5 from the outer (top) circuit is outside of the levitator. The 
magnetic field is located only between the lower and top circuits. Our design of superconductivity 
electric storage is different from common superconductivity ground storages. The first innovation 
is filling the internal core by a strong matter (stuff) which can keep the high tensile stress, the 
second innovation - we have only ONE turn (coil) of wire (the current superconductivity electric 
storages have a lot of turns and, as result, they are outward of the magnetic field).

  6. Artificial Magnetic field. The possibility of levitation can be increased thousands times by the 
artificial magnetic field. If the magnetic field has enough intensity, the people, car can fly without 
non-superconductivity levitators, the ground car can receive electric energy from variable magnetic 
field (it is a solution of a problem of an invironment and oil), the city resident can receive the 
electricity without wires, orbiting satellites and spaceships can receive the thrust and energy when 
they flyby over this region during their flights. That may be useful for big city having an dense 
street traffic. The computation of this case is in the Theoretical section and estimations in the 
Project section.

where wv is volume density of energy, J/m3, that is also internal pressure into energy storage in 
N/m2; wm is mass density of energy releted  to wire mass, J/kg; s is density of stuff, kg/m3; vmax is 
impulse of levitator stuff, m/s; Hmax is maximum altitude which the stuff can self-lift at Earth, m. 
These values show the energetic properties of syperconductivity stuff. Computation of them are 
presented in Figs. (9)-(11).
  The mass of the levitation engine is sum of stuff, wire, cover and cooling and control systems. If 
engine is intended for great acceleration and does not need large storage of energy, the main mass 
is wire. If device is designed as big storage of electric energy, the main mass is stuff (80 - 95%). If 
device operates in outer space, we do not need a cooling system; in the atmosphere the cooling 
system increases the mass of the engine by 10 - 30%.    
    For engine having large storage energy, the magnitudes of Eq. (6) is better computed for s -
density of stuff. They may be also computed for  w is specific mass of wire (coil of levitator).  The 
value of Eq. (6) may be computed for - density of engine. In this case vmax and Hmax is maximum 
speed and maximum altitude which can reach engine without useful load.
  Below are computations of Eq, (6).

                                           

Fig. 9. Specific mass energy of superconductivity AB levitation engine. These result may be 
applied to stuff, wire, and engine.

   The AB storage energy is similar to the heating value of a conventional fuel or the specific energy 
of a rocket fuel. Automotive gasoline has heating value 40106 J/kg, but internal combustion 
engine has efficiency coefficient about 0.3. That way we use only 12106 J/kg. More over, the 
combustion engine requires oxygen (air) and contaminates the Earth's atmosphere. The liquid 
rocket fuel (fuel + oxidizer) has about 12106 J/kg, the solid-rocket fuel has about 8106 J/kg.  As 
you see (Fig. 9), the superconductive storage is the same with the rocket fuel. but it is sufficiently 
more for B > 250 T. Our advantage is 100% efficiency, absence of air pollution and multi-using, 
because we can recharge the storage device many times.That has also good prospect because then 

we can have greater safety maximum B and more strong stuff of energy storage in the future 
(nanotubes).

                                         

Fig. 10. Specific impulse of supercondutivity engine. These results may be applied to wire, stuff 
and engine.

The specific impulse of current rocket fuel is about 2000  2500 m/s for solid fuel, 30003200 m/s 
for liquid fuel, and up 4000 m/s for hydrogen fuel. In our case, impulse is about 50,000  100,000 
m/s, in 20  40 times more (Fig. 10). Some electric propulsion has high impulse (10,00030,000 
m/s), but they are technically complex, need large electric energy, and produce only a small thrust. 
Our propulsion contains energy in its electric storage, can have a big thrust and can be charged 
distantly from the Earth by artificial magnetic field.

into energy storage. 

  Fig. 11 shows the volume density of energy and magnetic pressure into magnetic storage. Before 
B = 
100 T we can use the conventional strong fibers as internal stuff of the superconductive storage (see 
Table 2 below), in interval B = 100250 T we must use whiskers, and over B  250 T we need in 
nanotubes.

  2. Data. Magnetic field. Magnetic induction at the Earth's magnetic equator is 27.1 A/m (B = 
3.410-5  T), at the magnetic pole H = 52.5 A/m. In some regions (for example, near Kurs, Russia) 
H  100 A/m. Magnetic intensity at very high altitude is presented in Fig. 12, [5], p. 133. We will 
use B = 3.410-5  T in our projects up to the altitude 500 km. The closed magnetic field has the 

small Martian satellite Phobos. The Sun, Mars and Jupiter have magnetic fields and magnetic stars 
have powerful fields too. The White Dwarf star has B  80,000 T.

Some organic matters has temperature up 15 K. Polypropylene, for example, is normally an 
insulator. In 1985, however, researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences discovered that as an 
oxidized thin-film, polypropylene can have a conductivity 105 to 106 higher than the best refined 
metals.
  Boiled temperature of liquid nitrogen is 77.3 K, air 81 K, oxygen 90.2 K, hydrogen 20.4 K, 
helium 4.2 K [6]. 
  Unfortutately, most superconductive material is not strong and needs a strong covering. 

Material strong. Let us consider the following experimental and industrial fibers, whiskers, and 
nanotubes:
1.  Experimental nanotubes CNT (carbon nanotubes) have a tensile strength of 200 Giga-Pascals 

(20,000 kg/mm2). Theoretical limit of nanotubes is 30,000 kg/mm2.
 Young’s modulus  is over 1 Tera Pascal, specific density =1800 kg/m3 (1.8 g/cc) (year 2000).
2. 
        For safety factor n = 2.4, = 8300 kg/mm2 = 8.3×1010 N/m2, =1800 kg/m3, (/)=46×106. 
The SWNTs   nanotubes  have a density of  0.8 g/cm3,  and MWNTs have a density of 1.8 
g/cm3 (average 1.34 g/cm3 ) Unfortunately, the nanotubes are very expensive at the present time 
(1994). 

3.  For whiskers CD   = 8000 kg/mm2,    = 3500 kg/m3 (1989) [3, p. 33]. Cost about $400/kg 

(2001).

4.  For industrial fibers = 500 – 600 kg/mm2,   = 1800 kg/m3,   = 2,78×106. Cost about 2 - 5 

$/kg (2003).

       Figures for some other experimental whiskers and industrial fibers are given in Table 2.

3. Computation (Estimation) method. For estimation AB levitator the author recommends 
the following method based on Eq. (4) and on usial equations for volum, mass area, etc:
 1) Take the need payload (or mass needs in movement) mp , safety magnetic  intensity B, and 

dencity storige stuff and wire s , w (You can use the Tables 1, 2). You find by Eq. (5) (or by 
Figs. 9-11)  the magnitudes wv, wm , vmax, Hmax . Check up the tensile stress of stuff from the 
internal magnetic pressure p = wv in N/m2 or p = 10-7wv in kg/mm2 (Fig. 9).     

2) Take the need flight data: altitude H < Hmax , speed V < vmax , range L (H in m, V in m/s, L in 

m). The air drag D (in N) of your vehicle, the full mass mx (in kg),  or stuff mass ms (in kg) of 
your vehicle may be estimated by equations:

  Look your attention in the second Eq. (7): if we do not move our apparatus, the mass it may be

6) Total weight of levitation engine is sum of mass stuff plus mass wire m = ms + mw. It must be 

increased in 10  20% for cooling system and cover. 

Example of computation. Levitation of a flying human.
We want to design a levitation belt to lift a living human weighing 82 kg (Fig. 3).
1) Take the magnetic field into AB levitator B = 60 T; wire density w = 8000 kg/m3;  For B = 60 
T the magnetic internal pressure is p =107 wv = 140 kg/mm2. As the stuff may be taken the 
fiber  (Table 2). the stuff density s = 1800 kg/m3,  = 600 kg/mm2. The computation gives 
(Eq. (5) or Figs. (9)-(11) ): wv = 1.4109  J/m3, wm = wv/s = 7.8105  J/kg .

2) Take the flight speed V = 15 m/s = 54 km/s, range L = 100 km =100.000 m, altitude H = 100 
m, Ein = 0, k = 2, h = 0.1 m.  Compute the air drag:  D = 1.4 N and stuff mass ms = 0.36 kg 
(Eq. (7)).

3) Compute minimal radius and currency in belt: Rm = 0.2 m, i = 1.8108 A (Eq. (7)).
4) Compute volume, weight, and thickness of AB levitate belt (Eq. (8)):   = 1.6 mm .
5)  Compute cross-section and weight of superconductive wire (Eq. (9)) for density of electric 

currency j = 105 A/mm2: s = 1.18103  m2 ,  mw = 1.89 kg.         

  The sum mass of stuff and wire is about 0.36 + 1.89 kg  2.25 kg. This levitator mass we must 
increase about in 0.5 - 1 kg for cover, control and cooling system. The total mass of levitator is
about 3 kg. 
   The internal diameter is about 39 cm, outer diameter is about 42 cm, height of cylinder (belt) is 
about 12 cm (Fig.3). Remainder the total lift force (together with man) is 82 kg.
  These data are not optimal but acceptable for a market individual small vehicle (belt). The 
apparatus is based on current technology and can be made at present time (the many offered 
innovations and inventions must be used).

   5) Computation of AB Levitation Launcher. For B = 140 T specific impulse of AB engine 
equals the specific impulse of a liquid rocket engine. However one quickly decreases (as in the 
second power) when B increases. The tensile stress of the stuff also rapidly increases. For B = 140 
T it equals 780 kg/mm2. That is acceptable for whiskers having maximum   up 4000  8000 
kg/mm2. The very high B > 200 T is very efficiency as electric storage but request 
nanotubes as the stuff.
  The levitation launch has a many advantages, but in difference of rockets that does not spend a 
fuel mass. The weight of AB-engine is same in beginning and ending acceleration. As a result, 
the AB engine for high acceleration apparatus needs many stages of multi-launcher.  
  I recommend the following order of the estimation. Initially we do not include the wire mass, 
cover and the cooling system. Their mass is only 10 - 15% of the stuff mass. We take into 
account when we take the increased final useful weight of apparatus in 10 - 15%. They are 
included into in increased mass of stuff.
  The initial data are: the mass mp, final speed V, and final altitude H of apparatus (satellite, 
spaceship, or interplanetary probe). We take the equals distribute speed and altitudes between 
stages of the levitation accelerator.
  In these conditions the mass of every engine stages may be estimated by equations:

Moon and Mars is in Projects section.

6) Artificial of magnetic field. The capability of levitation apparatus may be increased thousand 
times if we create the outside strong artificial magnetic field. In powerful artificial magnetic 
field we can achieve sustained flight without superconductivity devices.  This field is useful in

big city having heavy traffic congestion. The artificial magnetic field may be created by 
superconductivity ring of a large diameter. This field may be also useful for spaceship. When 
they flyby into artificial magnetic field the force increases hundreds of times. 
  The data of the artificial magnetic field and flight apparatus may be computed by equations:


(14)
j
where F is lift force, N; i is electric currency, A; l is length of AB engine wire into open
magnetic field, m; B is intensity of the artificial magnetic field, T; j is density of electric 
currency of AB engine, A/m2; v is wire volume of engine, m3;  is wire mass density, kg/m3; s
is cross-section of wire, m2; r is wire electric resistance, ;  is specific resistance of wire, 
.cm; E is loess of energy into conventional (non-superconductivity) AB engine, J; m is wire 
mass, kg.
  From Eq. (14) we can receive the following ratios for estimation of a data of the levitation 
vehicles (do not having the superconductive wires):

Aluminum wire has  =2.8108 .m (at room temperature) and  mass density  = 2800 kg/m3. 
The maximum of a currency dencity for non-cooling wire is about j = 107 A/m2 (10 A/mm2). It 
is obvious, the first ratio in (14) must be over 1 for the levitation apparatus.
 The intensity H of the artificial magnetic field at altitude (Fig. 8c) may be computed by 
formula

where S is area of the ground closed loop ring (enveloped by electric currency), m2; the distance 
h equals approximately altitude for high height (Fig.8c, R = h).
  Weakness of artificial magnetic field is vertical direction of magnetic lines near ground 
surface. The magnetic force has horizontal direction. The levitation apparatus needs magnetic 
antennas (Fig. 5) for lift force creation (or other method for changing the direction of the 
magnetic lines). 
   The artificial magnetic field and apparatus lift force may be created by permanent magnets.
   The example of computation the levitation device for the flying individual human into 
artificial magnetic field are presented in section "Projects".

These data are enough for computation of the cooling systems.
   Using the correct design of multi-screens, high reflectivity screen, and vacuum between screens 
we can get a very small heat flow and a very small expenditure for refrigerant (some grams per day 
in Earth). In outer space the protected body can have low temperature without special liquid 
cooling system (Fig.6),.
   For example, the space body (Fig. 6a) with innovative prism reflector [3] Ch. 3A ( = 106, a = 
0.9) will have temperature 13 K in outer space. The protection Fig.6b gives more low temperature. 
The usual multi-screen protection of Fig. 6c gives the temperature: the first screen  - 160 K, the 
second - 75 K, the third - 35 K, the fourth - 16 K.

4. Projects

1. Flying (levitation) human was computed above in Theoretical section..
2.  Flying car (see plan and equations above):

1. Take the data: magnetic intencity B = 60 T, s = 1800 kg/m3, w = 8000 kg/m3, form is two

cylinders h = 1.5 m, Bn = 3.4105 T.

2. Computation:  wv = 1.4109  J/m3, P = 140 kg/mm2, wm = wv/s = 7.8105  J/kg .  
3. For V = 20 m/s = 72 km/h, H = 1000 m, L = 1000 km = 106 m, Ein = 7.2105  W,  Cx = 0.08, 

S = 1.5 m2, we receive  D  30 N,  ms = 52 kg for one cylinder. 

4. Minimal cylinder radius and currency (for lift force one cylinder F = 5500 N): Rm = 0.172 m,  
i = 5.16107  A.
5. Thickness of stuff:  = 17.8103 18 mm.
6. Cross-section and mass of wire (one tube) for currency density  j = 105  A/mm2: s = 5.16 cm2, 
mw = 12.4 kg.
7. Total mass of levitation engine (two tubes):  m = 1.12(52+12.4)  142 kg.

  The levitation engine may be designed as two tubes which join to any CURRENT cars. The 
internal combustion engine, transmission, fuel tank may be removed.
  The offered AB-engine not only saves the planetary invironment, releases a country from oil 
dependence, one spends energy sometimes less than when using a liqued fuel. The drag of 
usual car endures the friction of its wheels on the ground and some air drag. For friction 
coefficient 0.1 the friction drag for car mass 1000 kg is about 1000 N plus air drag 30 - 100 
N. The flying car does not have wheel friction. That means AB car spends an energy for 
moving that is 20 times less than a conventional car. Make corrections that internal 
combustion engine has efficiency coefficient about 0.3 and a design can be done for a special 
flight light (without usual engine, transmission, wheels, etc.) car with small aerodynamic drag 
and AB engine has 100% efficiency and return the energy spent to lifting and acceleration of 
car. Moreover the AB car can fly in a straight line. If planet without atmosphere has natural or 
artifical magnetic field you can have a free flight to any planet place.
  No problem to organize the air traffic for large numbers of the flying cars or flying people as 
is done for current aircraft and spacecraft. For example, in diapason of altitude 100-200 m 

flying cars move from West to East, in diapason 200 -300 m they move from North to South, 
in next diapason - from East to West and so on.  

3. Lavitation Aircraft with AB engine. Design the aircraft having a flight weight 100 tons. 
       1. Take mp = 105 kg, B = 120 T, s = 2300 kg/m3, w = 8000 kg/m3.    

 2. Computation:  wv = 5.7109  J/m3, P = 570 kg/mm2, wm = wv/s = 2.48106  J/kg .  
 3. For V = 250 m/s = 900 km/h, H = 30,000 m, L = 10,000 km = 107 m, Ein = 3.6105  W,  Cx = 
0.06, S = 9.07 m2, h = 14.5 m  (cylindrical tube is part of fuselage), we receive  D  300 N,  
ms = 2940 kg. 

4. Minimal cylinder radius and currency (for lift force of one cylinder F = 106 N): Rm = 1.69 m,  
i = 109  A.
5. Thickness of stuff:  = 6.44103 6.44 mm.
6. Cross-section and mass of wire (one tube) for currency density  j = 105  A/mm2: s = 0.01 m2, 
mw = 112 kg.
7. Total mass of levitation engine:  m = 2940 + 122  3062 kg. Together with cooling system 

the mass of AB engine will be about 3.3 tons. The same way may be computed hypersonic or 
space aircraft. They can operate at very high altitude and have a small drag. That means they 
will spend very little energy per flight. If the aircraft will fly across space, the spent energy 
will be very small. We can also design the levitation space submarine with AB engine.

4. Levitation (stasionary) Satellite with AB engine. Compute AB engine for self-launch 

levitation stationary communication satellite located at an altitude of 40 km. This satellite can 
service a region within a radius of 700 km.

1. Take the data: magnetic intensity B = 60 T, s = 1800 kg/m3, w = 8000 kg/m3, form is 

cylinders, h = 0.2 m, Bn = 3.4105 T, useful mass 80 kg.

2. Computation:  wv = 1.4109  J/m3, P = 140 kg/mm2, wm = wv/s = 7.8105  J/kg .  
3. For V = 0, H = 40,000 m, L = 0, Ein = 0,  k = 2. we receive  ms = 168.4 kg for one cylinder. 
4. Take the total mass of apparatus 280 kg. Minimal cylinder radius and currency (for lift force 

one cylinder F = 2600 N): Rm = 0.63 m,  i = 1.91108  A.

5. Thickness of stuff:  = 0,12 m .
6. Cross-section and mass of wire (one tube) for currency density  j = 105  A/mm2: s = 1.9103

7. Mass of levitation engine :  m = 1.1(168,4+1)  184.1 kg. Total mass of satellite is 

m, mw = 1 kg.

184.1+80=264.1  280 kg.

tons to Moon 

6. Space Launch system. Compute the AB space launcher for launching the spaceships of mass 20 

     and Mars. 
       1. Take payload mp = 25 tons =25103 kg, B = 140 T, Bn = 3.4105  T,   s = 2300 kg/m3, w = 

8000 kg/m3, final speed V = 11 km/s, final altitude is H = 200 km, number of stages N = 15.    

 2. Compute:  wv = 7.8109  J/m3, P = 780 kg/mm2, wm = wv/s = 3.4106  J/kg , vm = 2600 m/s, 
Hm = 340 km.  
3. Compute by Eq. (11) the mass of the last (N) stage: a = 1.1724, m(N) = 272 tons. 
4. Compute the minimal radius and minimal currency of last stagy for length h = 20 m, F = 
2.72106 N: 
    Rm = 2.86 m, i = 2109 A, ms(N) = 40103  kg.
5. Thickness of stuff:  = 14103   14 mm.
6. Cross-section and mass of wire for currency density  j = 105  A/mm2: s = 0.02 m2, mw =  6400 
kg.
7. Total mass of the last stage without upper stages is  40 tons, total 272 tons. 
 All stages can be re-used for thousands of launchs. They can await the spaceship in flight and 
maintain levitation positions. When the spaceship returns and its mass is same to the launch 
mass, then all stages brake the spaceship and restore its energy. After landing they readied for 
the next free launch. Note, all stages are the thickness tubes which are inserted one into other. 

7. Artificial Magnetic field. Let us take the supercoductive closed-loop cable-ring having radius R
= 10 km inside a big city. The efficiency radius of this ring is about 20 km or the diameter of 
artificial magnetic field is about 40 km. That is enough for any big city. If the cross-section area 
of the cable is 0.15 m2 and currency density is 1011 A/m2, the magnetic intensity B = oi/2R is 
about 1.9 T. Take for levitation devices the aluminum wire having  =2.8108 .m and   = 
2800 kg/m3,  j = 0.35106  A/m2, B = 1.8. From ratios (15) we receive 

Fkg/m = 11.5  or  115 N/kg,   E/m = 2.45 W/kg. 

If mass of flying man is 80 kg and together with levitation device that is 100 kg, the mass of wire 
will be  mw = 100/11.5 = 8.7 kg and the heat expenses of energy in levitation is 245 W or 8.8105 
J in hours. The good rechargable battery has storage of an energy about 70 Wh/kg = 2.5105 
J/kg. That means the 8 kg battery has energy E = 20105  J. That is enough for two hours of flight. 
If it has a speed V = 15 m/s = 54 km/h, our range equals more 100 km. The air drag for this speed 
requires about 1.4105  J.  The full weight of levitation device is about 17 - 18 kg.   
   The levitation car may be computed similarly, but it needs a small conventional engine for 
support of car battery. If we are not limited to strong expenditures of energy, the current density 
may be increases from 0.35 A/mm2 up to 10 A/mm2. That decreases the mass of wire by 30 times, 
but increases the heat loss in wire by two orders.
   The constant artificial magnetic field does not need in support energy. That also may be used as 
storage electric energy for big city. If we use the supercondutivity devices, the artificial magnetic 
field may be small. 
  If magnitic field is made variable and one direction of magnetic intensity (see Fig. 8b), this 
magnetic field will be able to pump the energy in the levitation engines and any special electric 
receivers having closed loop coil. We will not need a complex electric grid, which is in any big 
city. We can significently improve the parameters of city ring and flight non-superconductivity 
devices if we use well ferro-magnetic matter. If we use permanent magnits for  ground and 
apparatus, the human, vehicles can flight withotut spenging a large energy.
  The initial data in all our projects are not optimal. Our aim - it shows that AB engine may be 
designed by current technology

Discussion

  The offered AB engines may be made by existing technology. We have a superconductivity 
material (see Table 1), the strong artificial fibers and whiskers (Table 2), the light cooling system 
(Table 3) for the Earth's atmosphere, and the radiation screens for outer space. The Earth has 
enough magnetic field, the Sun and many planets and their satellites (as Phobos orbiting Mars) has 
also magnetic field. The magnetic stars has powerful magnetic field and White Dwarfs have huge 
magnetic field (up B = 80,000 T). No problem to create the artificial magnetic field on asteroids 
and planet satellites (for example, to create local artificial magnetic field on the Moon). We have a 
very good perspective in improving our devices because—especially during the last 30 years—the 
critical temperature of the supercoductive material increases from 4 K to 186 K and no theoretical 
limit for further increase. Moreover, Russian scientists received the thin layers which have electric 
resistance at room temperature in million times less then the conventinal conductors. We have 
nanotubes whith will create the jump in AB engines, when their production will be cheaper. The 
current superconductive solenoids have the magnetic field B  20 T.
  AB engines can instigate a revolution in air, ground, sea and space transport. They allow 
individuals to fly as birds, almost energy-free (without loss of total energy or small expenses of 
energy) flight with hypersonic and space speed to any point of Earth and to other planets. The 
interstellar probes can use the magnetic fields of satellites and planet for braking and acceleration.
  The AB engines solve the environment problem because they do not emit or evolve any polluting 
gases. They are useful in any solution for the oil-dependence problem because they use electricity 
and spend the energy for flight and other vehicles (cars) many times less than conventional internal 
combustion engine. In difference of a ground car, the levitation car flights in straight line to object.
  The AB engines create the revolution in communication by the low altitude stationary suspended 
satellites, in energy industry, and especially in military aviation.  They are very useful in lighting of 

Earth by additional heat and light Sun radiation because, in difference from conventional mobile 
space mirrors, they can be suspended over given place (city) and service this place.
   It is interesting, the toroidal AB engine is very comfortable for flying discs (UFO!) and have 
same property with UFOs. That can levitate and move in any direction with high acceleration 
without turning of vehicle, that does not excrete any gas, jet, that does not produce a noise. 
   Note, physicists have discussed for a long time the possible changing of weight the 
superconductivity magnet. Some of them are getting the changing and announce it as revolutionary 
discovery; others are repeating the test and getting negative results. The reason may be in different 
position their magnets and screening of part superconductivity coil about direction of the Earth's 
magnetic field.

   We must research and develop these ideas as soon as possible. They may to accelerate the 
technical progress and improve our life. There are no known scientific obstacles in the development 
and design of the AB engines, levitation vehicles, high speed aircraft, space launches, low aititude 
stationary communication satellites, cheap space trip to Moon and Mars and so on.

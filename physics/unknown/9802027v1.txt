Integration in General Relativity

Andrew DeBenedictis

Dec. 03, 1995

Abstract

This paper presents a brief but comprehensive introduction to cer-
tain mathematical techniques in General Relativity. Familiar mathe-
matical procedures are investigated taking into account the complica-
tions of introducing a non trivial space-time geometry. This transcript
should be of use to the beginning student and assumes only very basic
familiarity with tensor analysis and modern notation. This paper will
also be of use to gravitational physicists as a quick reference.

Conventions
The following notation is used: The metric tensor, gµν, has a signature of +2
and g =
. Semi-colons denote covariant derivatives while commas

1 Introduction

Say we have a tensor T then, like the partial derivative, the covariant
derivative can be thought of as a limiting value of a diﬀerence quotient.
A complication arises from the fact that a tensor at two diﬀerent points in
space-time transform diﬀerently. That is, the tensor at point r will transform
in a diﬀerent way than a tensor at point r + dr. In polar coordinates we are
familiar with the fact that the length and direction of the basis vectors change
as one goes from one point to another. If we have a vector written in terms
of its basis as follows,

(1)

V = V αeα

the derivative with respect to co-ordinate xβ would be:

∂xβ . The above derivative becomes (after relabelling dummy

When it comes to integration, we are performing the reversal of a partial
diﬀerentiation and can therefore not just integrate a covariant derivative.
Also, an integral over tensor components does not give a result which is a
tensor whereas integration over a scalar does.
We can convert expressions such as P ν

;ν into an expression containing only
;ν in terms of

partial derivatives as follows: First write out the expression P ν
the Christoﬀel symbol

The ﬁrst term in the last expression is equal to zero since it is gνα multiplied
by a tensor which is antisymmetric in ν, α. Therefore:

1.1 Tensor Densities

Ordinary tensors transform according to the following transformation law:

An object which transforms according to (11) is called a tensor density of
weight zero. A tensor density

of weight w transforms as follows:

which is similar to (11) except for the Jacobian term raised to the power of
w. We can convert tensor densities of weight w to ordinary tensors by noting
the transformation of the metric’s determinant.

It is these types of tensor densities which we want to consider when integrat-
ing. For example, consider the volume element d4x′ =
d4x. The corre-
sponding invariant volume element (the proper element) is √g′d4x = √gd4x.
We see that d4x has a weight of -1 since √g has a weight of +1.

The above result can be used to ﬁnd the covariant derivative of a tensor
density of arbitrary weight. Let ℘µ be a contravariant tensor of weight w
which we want to take the covariant derivative of. This can be written as
follows,

The ﬁrst term in the last expression is equal to zero from (18) and noting

Integrals of Second Rank Tensors

Second rank tensors are most easily handled if they are antisymmet-
ric. Consider an antisymmetric second rank tensor F αβ. We can take the
following covariant derivative:

;β = F αβ
F αβ

,β + F αµΓβ

µβ + F µβΓα

µβ.

Since F αβ is antisymmetric and the Christoﬀel symbols are symmetric the
F µβΓα

µβ term vanishes leaving:

As before, we write Γβ

µβ =

(√g),µ
√g

giving (after relabelling dummy indices)

Therefore, similar to the vector case

1.3 Killing Vectors

We can exploit symmetries in the space-time to aid us in integration of second
rank tensors. For example, does the metric change at all under a translation
x = xµ + ǫkµ(x)? This change is measured by the
from the point x = xµ to
Lie derivative of the metric along k,

e

£kgµν = lim
0
→

ǫ

gµν(x)

gµν(

x)

−
ǫ

.

e

If the metric does not change under transport in the k direction then the Lie
derivative vanishes. This condition implies the Killing equation

The solutions (if any) to this equation are called killing vectors.

kν;µ + kµ;ν = 0.

Time-like Killing vector of a spherically symmetric space-time:

Consider the following line element:

ds2 =

α2dt2 + a2dr2 + r2dθ2 + r2 sin2(θ)dφ2

(28)

−

where α and a are functions of the coordinates. The metric will be stationary
if the metric is time independent in some coordinate system.. That is,

∂gµν
∂x0 = 0.
Where x0 is a time-like coordinate. We write out the full expression for the
Lie derivative of the metric

(29)

£kgµν = kγgµν,γ + gµγkγ

,ν + gνγkγ
,µ.

Setting this equal to zero, a time like solution satisfying this equation is the
vector ﬁeld

Substituting this into (30) we get

(26)

(27)

(30)

(31)

(32)

which equals zero from (29). Therefore δα

0 is a killing vector ﬁeld for the

kα = δα

£kgµν = δγ

Consider the conservation law

T µν
;ν = 0

Where T is the stress energy tensor. We cannot integrate over this as we did
in the previous section since we would not be integrating over a scalar (due
to the presence of a free index). Therefore in general there is no Gauss’ law
for tensor ﬁelds of rank two or higher. If we can ﬁnd a killing vector ﬁeld in
the space we can use the Killing equation to form the following equation:

(kµT µν);ν = kµ;νT µν + kµT µν

;ν = 0

(note that the second term equals zero from (27) and therefore the ﬁrst term
equals zero as well). We then proceed as follows:

(kµT µν);ν = 0 = J ν
;ν

to which we can apply Gauss’ law as before.

Introduction 

Direct  coupling  of  the  fast  magnetosonic  wave  to  the  electrons  has  been  recently 
studied on TORE SUPRA. Preliminary experiments were dedicated to optimise the scenario 
for Fast Wave Electron Heating (FWEH) and Current Drive (FWCD). In a first part, thermal 
kinetic and diamagnetic energy are compared when fast wave is applied to the plasma in two 
different  regimes:  1/  the  minority  hydrogen  heating  scenario  (ICRH),  2/  the  direct  electron 
damping. Effects of ion resonant layers, marginally present in the plasma in the later regime 
(FWEH), is then presented and discussed. 

In the following, all plasmas are limited on the carbon inner wall, with R = 2.28 m and 
a = 0.72 m,  and,  unless  specified,  are  helium  plasmas  with  a  small  hydrogen  concentration 
(nH/ne < 5%). 
Thermal energy content 

On  TORE  SUPRA,  time  resolved  energy  spectra  of  fast  hydrogen  and  deuterium 
neutrals  are  routinely  measured  by  charge  exchange  (CX)  analysers  [1]  of  the  E||B  type  (46 
channels per mass, H and D, Emax = 300 keV) with different lines of sight: five in a poloidal 
cross-section  having  a  tangency  radius  Rt = 0.43 m  (near  “perpendicular”),  and  one  in  the 
equatorial plane with Rt = 1.9 m (near “parallel” to the magnetic axis, see figure 4).

Concerning  the  ion  energy  balance,  the  ion  temperature  profiles  are  simulated 
including:  1/  a  best  fit  to  the  passive  measured  spectra  of  each  analyser,  2/  for  all  the 
analysers,  the  same  normalisation  factor  for  the  neutral  density  profile  (fast  computed 
consistently  with  ion  temperature[2])  and  3/  the  consistency  with  neutron  yield  and  plasma 
composition.  Standard  diagnostics  provide  the  other  experimental  data  required  in  the

A  4-step  electron  density  scan 
is 
performed  on  a  4  s,  4  MW  ICRH  pulse 
(f = 57.4 MHz, dipole phasing), launched 
in 
plasma 
(nD/nHe (cid:31) 2,  B  =  3.9 T,  Ip=1.3 MA). 
Electron and ion kinetic thermal energies 
are  shown  on  figure  1.  In  the  ohmic 
phase,  diamagnetic  and  kinetic  energy 
are found in good agreement. The lowest 
density  point  corresponds  to  a  monster 
sawtooth.  For  the  other  points,  data  are 
averaged  during  100  ms  (about  two 
normal  sawteeth).  If  we  assume  that 
perpendicular  supra-thermal  ion  energy 
content is the difference between diamagnetic and thermal kinetic energy, it is within the error 
bars  for  the  high  density  point,  but  clearly  increases  with  decreasing  density.  The  thermal 
energy content has also been evaluated on a 4 MW pulse of FWCD (f = 47.7 MHz, co-current 
phasing)  launched  in  mainly  helium  plasma  (nD/nHe (cid:31) 0.7,  B = 2.2 T,  Ip = 0.76 MA).  It  is

found  equal  to  the  diamagnetic  energy,  indicating  that  the  supra-thermal  particle  energy 
content, if present, is negligible. 
Hydrogen spectra during FWEH optimisation 

To get a better efficiency for FWEH/CD, it is necessary to avoid any ion damping of 
the wave. Due to the outgasing of the TORE SUPRA carbon inner wall, it is impossible to get 
rid  of  hydrogen  and  deuterium.  A  precise  monitoring  of  the  position  of  the  ion  cyclotron 
layers is thus a necessity. The CX analysers, both parallel and perpendicular, appear to be the 
best tool to optimise the scenarios. For f=47.7 MHz (dipole phasing, 2MW, 2s), the magnetic 
field B has been scanned between 2.10 and 2.27 T on four consecutive shots (Ip = 0.75MA). 
The first harmonic hydrogen layer, W CH, is on the high field side (HFS) of the discharge, the 
second  one,  2W CH,  on  the  low  field  side  (LFS),  and  the  third  harmonic  of  majority  ions 
(deuterium  or  helium,  3W CD)  is  at  the  plasma  centre.  In  the  present  plasma  conditions,  no 
significant  damping  on  3W CD  is  expected.  This  is  experimentally  confirmed  by  the  usual 
maxwellian  shape  of  the  observed  deuterium  spectra  (figure  6).  Hydrogen  neutral  spectra 
measured  during  these  shots  (analysers  time  resolution:  65 ms)  are  shown  on  figure  2.  One

can notice that the perpendicular tail 
vanishes when increasing B from 2.1 
to  2.24 T,  and  that  above  2.2  T  a 
large non maxwellian tail appears on 
the parallel analyser. 
An ion of velocity v directed towards 
the  CX  analyser  (and  of  parallel 
velocity  v//),  making  a  CX  at  major 
radius Rcx, satisfies Rt/Rcx = v// / v. 
According  to  the  adiabatic  theory  of 
particle  trajectories  in  tokamak,  this 
ion,  before  the  CX,  can  cross  a 
(nW CH, 
cyclotron 
n=1,2,...)  only  if  Rcx  -  Rt2  /  Rcx  £
 
RnW CH.  The  equality  corresponds  to 
Figure 3 
a trapped ion with banana tips on the 
resonant  layer,  which  interacts  strongly  with  the  wave.  The  corresponding  value  of  Rcx  is 
shown on figure 3 for each harmonic layer present in the plasma (1.56 < RnW CH < 3.2). One 
can check that, in the present B-scan, particles interacting with the W CH layer can be detected 
by the parallel analyser when  doing  their CX on the LFS and by the perpendicular analyser 
when doing their CX on the HFS. However the energy of the ions in the present case is low

(E<20keV, cf. figure 2). The particles making their CX on the HFS are thus mostly re-ionised 
before  reaching  the  perpendicular  analyser.  The  ions  accelerated  on  W CH  (HFS)  are  then 
mainly  detected  by  the  parallel  analyser.  And  in  the  same  way,  the  perpendicular  analyser 
mainly  detects  the  ions  accelerated  on  the  2W CH (LFS) layer. It is thus possible,  using  both 
CX analysers, to explain the B-scan experiments results as the 2W CH layer moving outside the 
plasma, and the W CH layer progressively entering on the HFS. Finally B=2.17 T represents the 
optimum field, where no significant ion damping competes with the direct electron heating. 
This is also well confirmed by the expected positions of the cyclotron layers shown in Table I, 
except that at B=2.10T the 2W CH layer is 4 cm outside the plasma and that a significant tail is 
however  observed.  One  must  remember  here  that  the  ripple  effect  is  quite  high  on  the  low 
field  side  of  TORE  SUPRA.  Indeed,  for  the  case  B = 2.10T,  R+a  increases  by  3  cm  and 
R2W CH decreases by 15 cm between two coils[3]. 
So  it  is  clear  on  figure  4  that  confined  protons 
can interact with the wave.

The  Doppler  effect  also  broadens  the  cyclotron 
layer,  thus  being  coupled  to  the  ions  a  few 
centimetres  deeper  in  the  plasma.  Finally,  since 
few obstacles are located on the outer part of the 
plasma  chamber,  one  can  expect  sufficient 
confinement  of  5-30  keV  protons  in  the  low 
electron, high neutral density plasma located on 
the  low field side of the torus, thus giving  rise 
to that relatively high neutral signal observed on the perpendicular analysers when 2.1 < B < 
2.2 T (2W CH, upper right black square on figure 3).

Ion-electron competitions during FWEH/CD experiments 

A  larger  B-scan  has  been  performed  (1.37<B(T)<2.2),  at  f=47.7MHz,  in  order  to 
investigate the possibility for maximizing the electron single-pass absorption (which scales as 
B-3).  But  lowering  B  also  means  entering  the  2W CH  layer  into  the  plasma,  and  thus  a 
competition  with  ion  damping  (which  increase  also  with  ion  temperature  Ti).  Figure  5 
displays  the  CX  analysers  measurements  for  various  B  values,  the  corresponding  cyclotron 
layers locations being given in Table II. One clearly distinguish the increasing absorption on 
the 2W CH layer as it enters the plasma towards the centre (and experiences an increasing Ti, B 
from 2.2 to 1.69T), followed by a decrease as B varies from 1.69 to 1.37T. The FW single-
pass  absorption  computations,  as  well  as  full-wave  simulations,  confirm  the  observations, 
revealing  a  switch  between  the  electron  and  ion  dampings  when  the  2W CH  layer  is  at  the 
plasma centre (B=1.69T). 

Another example of such a competition between ions and electrons has been observed 
when  phasing  the  currents  between  the  FW  antenna  straps,  for  FWCD  experiments.  In  that 
case,  the  averaged  parallel  wave  number  decreases,  lowering  the  electron  single-pass 
absorption. This is well confirmed by the neutral spectra measurements, in cases where the set

f / B is not optimised: for 48MHz / 2.25T, W CH layer is slightly inside the plasma on the high 
field side. On figure 6, hydrogen spectra measured during FWEH for two different shots, with 
these  f / B  values,  are  presented.  We  can  see  that  spectra  remain  low  in  dipole  phasing 
(#13764),  but  with  the  co-current  phasing  (#13774),  we  observe  a  large  increase  of  the

Conclusions 

On TORE SUPRA CX analysers 1/ prove to be a powerful tool in the determination 
and  optimisation  of  the  FWEH/CD  scenarios,  2/  permit  direct  observation  of  competing 
damping mechanisms for ions and electrons.

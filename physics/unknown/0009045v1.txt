Geometric interactions in a new relativistic geometric unified theory include interactions other than gravitation and
electromagnetism. In a low energy limit one of these interactions leads essentially to a Fermi type theory of weak
interactions.

Introduction.
A  non  linear  geometric  theory  that  unifies  gravitation  and  electromagnetism  offers  the  possibility  of  representing
other interactions by a sector of the connection [1 ]. It has been shown that new electromagnetic consequence of the
theory lead to quanta of electric charge and magnetic flux, providing a plausible explanation to the fractional quan-
tum Hall effect [2] , [3 ]. On the other hand we also have considered an approximation to this geometric non linear
theory [4 ] where the microscopic physical objects (geometric particles) are realized as linear geometric excitations,
geometrically described in a jet bundle formalism shown to lead to the standard quantum field theory techniques.
These geometric excitations are essentially perturbations around a non linear geometric background space solution,
where the excitations may be considered to evolve with time. In this framework, a geometric particle is acted upon by
the background connection and is never really free except in absolute empty background space (zero background
curvature). The background space carries the universal inertial properties which should be consistent with the ideas
of  Mach  [5 ]  and  Einstein  [6 ]  that  assign  fundamental  importance  of  far-away  matter  in  determining  the  inertial
properties of local matter. We may interpret the geometric excitations as geometric particles and the background as
the particle vacuum. This is a generalization of what is normally done in quantum field theory when particles are
interpreted as vacuum excitations. The vacuum is replaced by a geometric symmetric curved background space and
current solution which we call the substratum. The field equation of the theory admits a constant connection and
current substratum solution [7] , [8].

The role that Clifford algebras play in the geometrical structure of the theory provides a link to the non classical
interactions  theories.  The  structure  group  of  the  physical  geometry  is  the  simple  group  of  automorphisms  of  the
Clifford algebra. The combinations of the fundamental geometric excitations corresponding to the holonomy sub-
groups of the connection display an interesting SU(3)SU(2)U(1) combinatorial symmetry [9 ]. The standard model,
that shows this symmetry, has had many successes in describing weak and strong interactions that lead to a general
acceptance of the model. Nevertheless, nowadays, this model may be considered an effective theory of some other
more general theory. History has shown us that in many cases, progress in physics is attained by the evolution or
replacement of models, that provide partial fits to experimental data, by more general ones. The consideration of
geometrical strings  to represent physical concepts indicates a present trend in this direction. Therefore, in the quest
of unification, the lack of an a established relation between geometry and the standard model should not deter us from
investigating the possible physical interpretations of the odd sector of the connection which precisely holds the key to
its relation with the standard model. This sector certainly does not represent simply the classical interactions and, in
particular,  may  help  clarify  a  possible  relation  to  the  standard  model.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  physical  geometry
indicates there is complementary approach to particles and their interactions related to another model [10 ]. As first
task we consider here low energy aspects of  weak interactions.

The holonomy groups of the connection may be used geometrically to classify the interactions contained in theory.
The subgroup chain SL(4,R) ⊃ Sp(4,R) ⊃ SL(2,C) characterizes a chain of subinteractions with reducing sectors  of
non classical interactions  In this article we shall mainly concern ourselves with Sp(4,R)  and SL(2,C) connections

A section is related  by charts (coordinates) to elements of the group, SL(4,R), which are matrices that form a frame
of general SL(4,R) column spinors. The connection is a sl(4,R) 1-form that acts naturally on the frame e (sections).

 The field equation, which relates the derivatives of the curvature to a current source J is

in terms of the frame e, an orthonormal set of the algebra κ, the correlation in spinor spaces  and an space-time tetrad
u.  The  coupling  constant  is  4πα,  where α,  is  the  fine  structure  constant.  This  relation  introduces  a  fundamental
length, as we shall see later.
The field equation implies a conservation law for the geometric current, which determines a generalized Dirac equa-
tion in terms of the frames. This equation, for the even an odd parts of a frame f reduces, under certain restrictions
[11 ], to

which is the equation normally associated with a neutrino field. A fluctuation of f+   on the fixed background obeys
also the last equation.
We also have suggested that particles may be represented  by excitations on a geometric background. In particular, the
electron and neutrino, at fixed states, correspond to matrices with only one non zero column which form an algebraic
representation of the group.

Geometric Weak Interaction.
If the geometric  theory has anything to do with the weak interactions, it should be possible to represent electron
neutrino  interactions  within  these  geometric  ideas.  From  the  discussion  of  previous  articles,  we  consider  that  an
electroweak interaction may be related to the action of the Sp(4,R) holonomy group. The total interaction field should
be represented by a sp(4,R) connection Γ. The total matter current should be associated to a Sp(4,R) frame f present-
ing  both the electron field e and the neutrino field ν. to avoid confusion, in this article we use the symbol f for a
general section reserving e for electron sections
At a point, the total frame f of the interacting e, ν is related to an element of the group Sp(4,R), a subspace of the
geometric algebra R3,1, =R(4). The frame f may be decomposed into fields associated to the particles e, ν by means of
the  addition  operation  within  the  algebra.  These  e, ν  fields  are  not  necessarily  frames  because  addition  does  not
preserve the group subspace Sp(4,R) and geometrically, e ν are sections of a fiber bundle with space-time  as base and
the Clifford algebra as fiber.

The source current J in the theory is

where  f  is  the  frame  a  section  associated  to  the  total  field  of  the  electron  and  the  neutrino  and κ  represents  the
orthonormal set. For the Sp(4,R) group the correlation reduces to conjugation.
Due to the properties that a neutral particle field should have, we consider that the effect produced  by ν should be
small relative to the effect of e (there are no electromagnetic or massive effects). Hence we may assume that, in the
composite system, ν is a perturbation of the order of the structure constant α, the only physical constant in the theory.

It should be noted that the neutrino ν automatically associates itself, by Clifford addition, with the even part η of the
electron. This corresponds to the Weinberg Salam association of the left handed components as a doublet, with the
same Lorentz transformation properties.
If we apply perturbation theory to the field equations, we expand the connection Γ in terms of the coupling constant

It is well known that the second variation of a Lagrangian serves as Lagrangian for the first varied Euler equations.
Therefore, the ΓJ term in the covariant derivative  present in the Lagrangian proposed in [1] provides an interaction
coupling term that may be taken as part of the Lagrangian for the process in discussion. When the ΓJ term is taken in
energy units, considering that the Lagrangian has an overall multiplier, it should lead to the interaction energy for the
process. The second variation (or differential) in a taylor expansion of the energy U, corresponds to the Hessian of U.

representing  a  current-current  interaction  Hamiltonian,  with  a  coupling  constant  derived  from  the  fine  structure
constant. This new expression may be interpreted as a weak interaction Fermi Lagrangian. The associated coupling
constant is of the same order as the standard weak interaction coupling constant, up to terms in the Green’s functions

Relation with Fermi’s Theory
The action, in terms of elements of the algebra  and the trace, corresponds to the scalar product. For the case of the
isotropic homogeneous constant solution [12 ]  the Greens function is a multiple of the unit matrix with respect to the
algebra components. We assume here that for a class of solutions the Green’s function have this property. Then for
this class of solutions, the last equation may be written as

The current defines an equivalent even current j-, the κ0 component, by inserting  κ0κ0   and commuting, as follows,

Each 2×2 block component of this 4 dimensional real current matrix is an even matrix which may be represented as
a complex number, by the known isomorphism between the complex algebra and a subalgebra of 2×2 matrices. Thus,
we may use, instead of the generalized spinors forming the frame f,  the standard spinor pairs, η
2  which
form the matrices corresponding to the even part, respectively, of the electron and neutrino. The first term of j-, which
corresponds to a non hermitian term, is

system. We shall indicate by jF .this current plus its hermitian conjugate.
As discussed in the previous publications, within this theory particles would be represented by excitations of frames.
These fluctuations are matrices that correspond to a single representation of the subgroup in question. This means
that for each pair of spinors of a spinor frame, only one is active for a particular fluctuation matrix. In other words, for
a fluctuation, only one of the components of the matrix in eq. (27) is non zero and we may omit the indices on the
spinors.

This expression fixes the value  of a weak interaction constant G in terms of the fine structure constant α  and a

We recognize that the general perturbation for the interaction of the electron and the neutrino  fields includes eqs. (28,
34) which essentially are the current and Lagrangian assumed in Fermi’s theory [13 , 14 ] of weak interactions [15 ,
16 ] of leptons. Fermi’s theory is contained, as a limit  within the unified theory  of connections and frames discussed
in these series of papers. On the other hand, the full theory is accepted there are certainly new effects and implications
to consider, which should be determined without making the phenomenological considerations made in this section
to display the relation of our theory to low energy weak interactions.

( 39)

In particular, we should not expect that electroweak theory is related to another coupling “constant”, Because of the
non linearity of the theory, it is not correct to assume that if we subtract from a full solution, a partial electromagnetic
solution, we get another solution. The same thing applies to strong nuclear forces. Strong and nuclear interactions
were historically introduced to account for physical phenomena not explained by electromagnetic and gravitational
fields. We may say that nuclear effects are residual, in the sense that they theoretically correspond to the residue of
subtracting a solution to  linear equation from a non linear equation

Conclusion.
It was shown that the general perturbation technique for the interaction of the electron and neutrino fields lead to eqs.
(28,34) which are essentially the current and Lagrangian assumed in Fermi’s theory of weak interactions of leptons.
Fermi’s theory is contained, as a low energy limit  within the geometric unified theory of connections and frames
discussed in these series of papers. It is also clear that if the full theory is accepted there are certainly  new effects.

The geometric fundamental unit of length was calibrated in terms of the accepted value for weak interaction coupling
constant calculated from muon decay. From this knowledge, a value for the range of the W was estimated  which
although far from other theoretical estimates may be considered within the experimental “ballpark”, without present
day theoretical assumptions. Of course, we must consider in the future high energy applications which may shed some
light into the relation of this geometry with the standard model [17,18].

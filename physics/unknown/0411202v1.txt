Abstract:    The time in an atomic clock in motion is discussed using the analogy of a sing around 

sound source. Sing around frequency is modified according to the motion of the sing around sound 

source,  using  the  Lorentz  transformation  equation.  Thus,  if  we  use  the  sing  around frequency  as  a 

reference, we can define the reference “time”. We propose that the time delay of an atomic clock in 

motion  be  derived  using  the  sing  around  method.  In  this  letter,  we  show  that  time  is  defined  by  a 

combination of light speed and motion.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Key  words:    Atomic  clock  in  motion,  Lorentz  transformation,  Michelson-Morley  experiment, 

  The derivation of the Lorentz transformation equation was clearly described by Feynman et al. [1]. 

The Doppler shift equation was observed to be different between acoustic wave and light, thus we 

determined the reason for this difference [2]. We pointed out that the frequency of  a sound source 

should  be  modified  according  to  its  motion.  We  proposed  a  sing  around  sound  source  whose 

frequency changes with its velocity, as is suggested by the Lorentz transformation equation. 

We  discussed  the  reference  frequency  of  a  moving  sound  source  with  respect  to  the  Lorentz 

transformation  equation.  The  sing  around  sound  source  moving  in  air  exhibits  a  decrease  in 

frequency.  If  the  modified  frequency  is  used  as  a  reference  frequency,  the  time  delay  in  a  moving 

frame can be explained [2]. 

We also proposed a number of feasible experiments [3, 4]. These experiments are concerned with 

signaling  by  quantum  entanglement  [3]  and  interference  [4],  and  may  provide  for  another 

interpretation of special relativity. 

  We clearly accept the theory of special relativity. However, at this stage, we are not satisfied with

its current interpretation, because investigating phenomena using its current interpretation is difficult. 

We believe that special relativity can be defined in a simpler manner. In this study, to define the time 

delay in motion, we propose a use of the analogy of a sing around sound source in motion.   

2. ATOMIC CLOCK IN MOTION 

A. Analogy of sing around sound source in motion 

In  acoustic  waves,  for  the  measurement  of  sound  speed,  not  only  interference  but  also  the  sing 

around  method  is  used.  The  sing  around  method  uses  two  pairs  of  transmitters  and  receivers  as 

shown  in  Fig.  1,  where  a  pulsed  signal  is  transmitted  by  transmitter  1  and  detected  by  detector  2. 

After  its  detection,  the  pulsed  signal  is  amplified  by  amplifier  2,  and  a  new  pulsed  signal  is 

transmitted  by  transmitter  2,  detected  by  detector  1,  transmitted  again  by  transmitter  1,  and  so  on. 

The  frequency  of  the  sing  around  sound  source  was  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  repetition  of 

pulsed acoustic waves, and detected using the frequency counter.

Now let us consider the frequency modification according to the motion of the sing around sound 

source. Here, we show that the frequency of the sing around sound soured is defined by the traveling 

time of the pulsed sound between a transmitter and a receiver. According to the motion of the sing 

around sound source, the traveling distance of the pulsed sound is increased. Therefore, the motion 

of  the  sing  around  sound  source  in  air  decreases  the  sing  around  frequency.  The  frequency 

modification according to the motion of the sound source depends on the relationship between the 

sound direction and the motion direction of the sound source. If the sing around sound source moves 
transverse to the sing around direction, i.e., θ = π/2, where θ is the angle between the sound direction 
and the motion direction of  the sound source  shown in Fig.  2,  we obtain

velocity of the sing around sound source, t0 = L/cA is the reference time at rest, whereas t1 is that in 

motion. The representation of the modified frequency is similar to that of the Lorentz transformation.

motion  is  transverse  to  the  direction  of  sound,  i.e., θ = π/2.  Sing  around  frequency

can be determined. It is because the going and returning paths are equal. 

 

 

If the sing around sound source moves parallel to the sound direction, the sing around frequency 

cannot  be  determined,  because  the  going  and  returning  traveling  times  of  the  sound  are  different.

L + vt2. Returning time t3 is the period that pulsed sound transmitted from T2 (at the time 

t2) is received by R2 (at the time t = t2+ t3). Returning path is cAt3, we obtain the equation 

cAt3 = L - vt3, t3 is not equal to t2.

As  mentioned  above,  the  sing  around  frequency  is  defined  as  the  frequency  of  repetitions.  The 

frequency of repetitions is used as a fundamental (reference) frequency which can be used to define 

“time”. We note here the analogy between the sing around sound source and the atomic clock, in that 

the  reference  frequency  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  velocity  of  the  motion  v  as  the 

representation of the Lorentz transformation.   

We propose that the reference time, which is defined by the fundamental frequency, of the atomic 

clock is similar to the frequency definition mechanism of the sing around sound source.   

B. Atomic clock in motion   

There are similarities between the sing around sound source and the atomic clock. We can apply 

the concept of the sing around sound source to the atomic clock. The reference time of the atomic

from  point  sound  source  P  for  all  directions.  The  intensity  of  sing  around  frequency  is 
proportional to sinθ, for example, at θ = π/2 reflection points are on the circle 2πL, at θ = 0 
reflection points are only R1 and R2. Resonance condition is θ = π/2, i.e., on this condition 
going time and returning time is equal, then sing around frequencies can be defined, whose 

frequency  is  represented  by  Lorentz  transformation.  According  to  the  analogy  of  sing

around sound source, we can define the time of atomic clock in motion. 

clock in motion can be determined on the basis of the flight time of photons. The photon in the atom 

in  motion  travels  a  longer  distance  than  the  atom  at  rest.  Let  us  consider  the  electromagnetic 

phenomenon in an atom. This phenomenon occurs through a photon.   

Let us discuss the flight time of a photon in an atomic clock. As mentioned above, we assume that 

information is transmitted through photon; the time of the atomic clock is then defined by the flight 

time of the photon. Photons in an atomic clock in motion have to travel a longer distance than those 

in an atomic clock at rest. If the atomic clock moves at the velocity  v,  the photons travel different 

distances  according  to  the  direction  of  flight.  Photons  in  an  atomic  clock  at  rest  are  emitted  in  all 

5 

 

 

directions and have the same traveling distance independent of their directions. However, in motion, 

the  travel  distance  of  the  photons  depends  on  their  direction.  Figure  4  shows  the  probability  of 
photon arrival, where θ is the direction between the atomic clock motion and the traveling photon. 
The probability of photon arrival depends on sinθ. At θ =π/2, as mentioned in section 2.A, we obtain

where c is light the speed, t1 is the time when a photon arrives at position R, L is the photon path in 

the atomic clock at rest, and v is the velocity of the atomic clock in motion, t0 = L/c is the reference 

time in the atomic clock at rest, whereas t1 is the reference time in the atomic clock in motion.     

The probability of photon arrival is proportional to sinθ, and the most frequent case is at θ = π/2. 

This indicates that the probability that a photon moves parallel or antiparallel to the atom motion is 
very low. At θ = π/2,  we obtain a high probability.   

3. DISCUSSION 

We  discuss  electromagnetic  phenomena,  for  example,  the  radiation  of  an  atomic  clock. 

Electromagnetic phenomena occur through photons, i.e., they are exchanges of photons. According 

to  equation  (2),  the  photon  path  L  is  geometrically  expanded  when  the  atomic  clock  is  in  motion. 

(Here, L is for an atom radius.) Therefore, it takes more time in the atomic clock in motion than in 

the  atomic  clock  at  rest.  We  assume  that  the  exchanges  of  photons  occur  resonantly.  It  is  because 

only  the  photon  moving  transversely  to  the  atom  motion  direction  can  be  modified  as  shown  in 

equation  (2).  The  photon  moving  parallel  to  the  atom  motion  direction  cannot  participate  in 

electromagnetic  phenomena,  because  the  resonant  frequency  cannot  be  determined.  Of  course  the 

resonant  exchange  of  photons  is  a  highly  speculative  hypothesis,  however  large  amount  of 

experimental  data  show  that  equation  (2)  is  entirely  accurate,  indicating  that  these  data  are  in 

accordance with the hypothesis.   

The representation of “photon exchange” as well as that of “resonance”, is ambiguous. Testing the 

hypothesis  by  experiment  is  not  feasible;  however,  simple  geometrical  representation  is  attractive. 

We  can  directly  derive  the  Lorentz  transformation  equation  for  time  delay  geometrically,  which  is 

different  from  the  conventional  technique.  The  conventional  technique  of  deriving  the  Lorentz 

transformation equation is shown in the appendix.   

4. CONCLUSION 

In this letter, we showed that time is a combination of light speed and motion. We discussed the

time  in  the  atomic  clock  in  motion,  using  the  analogy  of  the  sing  around  sound  source.  The  sing 

around  frequency  is  modified  according  to  the  motion  of  the  sing  around  sound  source,  using  the 

Lorentz transformation equation. If we use the sing around frequency as the reference, we can define 

the reference “time”. We propose that the time delay of the atomic clock in motion be derived using 

the sing around method.

Appendix: Derivation of Lorentz transformation equation 

  From the results of the Michelson-Morley experiment, 2t1 = t2 + t3 was confirmed, where t1 and t2 

are represented by equations (1) and (2) respectively. Therefore, the distance L is assumed to shrink. 

L is the distance measured vertically to the motion direction, and LL is the distance measured parallel 

to the motion direction,

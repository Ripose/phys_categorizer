Abstract 
 
An approach to electron correlation effects in atoms that uses quantum trajectories is 
presented. A comparison with the exact quantum mechanical results for 1D Helium 
atom shows that the major features of the correlated ground state distribution and of 
the  strong  field  ionization  dynamics  are  reproduced  with  quantum  trajectories.  The 
intra-atomic  resonant  transitions  are  described  accurately  by  a  trajectory  ensemble. 
The present approach reduces significantly the computational time and it can be used 
for both bound and ionizing electrons.

1. Introduction 

time  dependent  quantum-mechanical  effects 

Owning  to  the  recent  developments  in  laser  technology  large  range  of 
intensities  and  pulse  durations  became  available  to  the  experiment.  The  field 
strengths  produced  in  the  laboratories  can  exceed  significantly  the  Coulomb 
field  experienced  by  the  electrons  in  the  atom,  while  the  duration  of  the 
generated  pulses  span  below  one  femtosecond.  This  opens  broad  avenues  for 
investigation of the detailed electron motion in atoms and molecules that may 
reveal new fundamental physics and is also of major importance for the design 
of ultra-small scale electronic and photonic devices. Therefore, progress in the 
calculation  of 
in  atomic, 
molecular,  and  condensed  matter  systems  has  become  indispensable.  The 
reason is that the many-electron systems are in general described by a multi-
partite  time  dependent  wave  function  Ψ(x1,x2,….,xn,t)  whose  practical 
computation  is  extremely  demanding  because  the  computational  effort  scales 
exponentially  with  the  system  dimensionality.  Therefore,  only  atoms  with  a 
few electrons can be treated by a direct solution of time dependent Schrödinger 
equation.  Several  approximate  methods  have  been  used  in  order  to  make  the 
time  dependent  evolution  more  tractable.  One  of  those  is  the  single  active 
electron  (SAE)  approximation  where  only  the  most  outer  electron  interacts 
with the laser field [1]. However, for strong fields and in attosecond time scale 
it is expected that the detailed motion of one of the electrons can significantly 
modify  the  motion  of  the  rest  of  the  electrons  in  their  orbits,  so  clearly  such 
correlation effects cannot be taken into account by SAE. Two other approaches 
that go beyond SAE are the time dependent Hetree-Fock method and the time 
dependent  density  functional  method,  but  these  also  fail  to  describe  correct 
correlated  dynamics  in  strong  fields  [2-4].  More  recently,  much  progress  has 
been achieved by multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree [5] (-Fock [6]) 
method which allows the inclusion of correlation effects in a more systematic 
way.  However,  these  methods  also  seem  to  be  time-expensive  when  dealing 
with  multi-electron  systems.  An  alternative  approach  that  accounts  for  the 
correlated  electron  motion  in  the  regime  of  strong  field  ionization  uses 
classical  equations  of  motion  instead  of  the  Schrödinger  equation.  It  has 
proven  to  be  able  to  reproduce  well  the  atomic  non-sequential  double 
ionization,  with  an  order  of  magnitude  less  computational  effort  [7].  Clearly, 
the use of classical methods is limited when quantum interference effects are 
important.  Here,  a  quantum  trajectory  method  is  used  which  combines  the 
promise  of  delivering  exact  quantum-mechanical  results  with  the  affordable 
time scaling of the classical calculations. 
 

2. Model 

We  introduce  the  quantum  trajectory  method  to  high-field  and  short  pulse 
interactions  by  using  a  simplified  one-dimensional  Helium  model  atom,  with 
soft  core  potentials  [8].  Accordingly,  the  time  evolution  of  the  two-electron 
wave function in an external field is governed by the Schrödinger equation (in 
atomic units):

Although  Eq.  (1)  can  be  solved  numerically  without  further  approximations, 
we  apply  here  the  standard  mean-field  approximation  which  reduces  that 
equation to a set of equations for the single-electron orbitals. Provided that the

 Unlike in the standard approaches (e.g. the density functional approximation) 
where the correlation effects are taken into account by adding additional terms 
to the Hamiltonian (e.g. in [3]), here we transform the mean-field Hartree term 
itself,  so  that  the  correlated  electron  dynamics  can  be  included  ab  initio  into 
the  equations  of  motion.  To  this  end  we  note  first  that  the  space-averaged 
character  of  the  Hartree  term  stems  from  the  integral  over  the  coordinate  xj 
which  is  also  an  argument  of  the  time  dependent  wave  function,  whereas  xj 
itself  is  a  time-independent  variable.  In  order  to  relate  x1,2  directly  to  the 
electron  motion  it  is  assumed  here  that  there  is  an  ensemble  of  N  couples  of 
classical particles where each one of the particles belongs to a different orbital. 
Then, we assume that the k-th particle from the j-th electron orbital has a well 
defined trajectory

In  this  way  the  Hartree  equation  has  been  transformed  to  a  set  of  single-
particle  Schrödinger  equations  coupled  by  the  time  dependent  e-e  Coulomb 
potential  (the  third  term  in  Eq.  (4))  which  includes  explicitly  the  momentary 
position  of  the  one  electron  from  each  couple.  Here  c=1  is  used.  Clearly  a 
particle-wave dualism has been assumed in that each electron is described by 
both  trajectory  and  wave  function.  In  order  to  complete  that  set  of  equations 
we need equation of motion for the particles, that would allow us to determine 
.  One  intuitively  clear  and  straightforward  way  is  to  use 
the  trajectories

The  velocity  field  in  Eq.  (5)  can  be  calculated  by  using  the  symmetry 
properties of the wave function. For example, the field free Hamiltonian in Eq. 
(1) is symmetric under the exchange of the two coordinates x1 and x2 and thus 
the wave function can be chosen to be symmetric (singlet state). Then, we have

standard approach of the de Broglie-Bohm theory one arrives at the Hamilton-
Jacobi  set  of  equations,  which  are  nonlinear  and  contain  quantum  potentials 
[9].  Fortunately,  these  can  be  reverted  back  to  the  set  of  linear  Schrödinger 
equations,  Eq.  (4),  which  are  by  far  more  favourable  for  numerical 
calculations. 
 

the 

 3. Results 

It is clear from the above considerations that the calculation of the correlated 
multi-electron  dynamics  can  be  simplified  significantly  since  the  trajectories 
used are finite number and these are contained in the physical space unlike in 

the original Schrödinger equation where the wave function is an object defined 
in the configuration space. Before we apply the quantum trajectory method to 
the  correlated  two-electron  system  we  first  implement  it  for  a  1D  single 
electron  atom  (1D  Hydrogen)  with  a  soft  core  potential.  For  Hydrogen  all 
terms related to the second electron are removed from Eqs. (1-4). Our goal is 
to  demonstrate  how  the  quantum  trajectory  ensemble  follows  the  time 
evolution  of  the  atomic  wave  function  during  a  resonant  transition  from  the 
ground state to the first excited state of the model atom. First, the ground state 
is  calculated  so  that  the  trajectory  distribution  matches  the  ground  state 
probability  given  by  the  solution  of  the  Schrödinger  equation,  as  described 
below for Helium. The ground state distribution of the wave function and the 
distribution  of  of  the  trajectory  ensemble  after  Gaussian  interpolation  are 
shown in the left hand image in Fig. 1. Next, the atom is irradiated by electric 
pulse with an amplitude 0.01 a.u. and frequency 0.395 a.u. which matches the 
resonant  frequency  of  the  electron  transition.  The  duration  of  the  pulse  is 
chosen  so  that  the  atom  is  completely  inverted  to  the  first  excited  state  after 
that pulse. It can be seen from Fig.1 that the two distributions match well at the 
beginning and at the end of the resonant transition.

quantumtrajectory distribution. The right hand image shows the distributions after 
transition to the first excited state. 10 000 quantum trajectories are used. 

 

 

Next,  we  compare  the  results  for  the  ground  state  of  the  1-D  Helium 
atom as calculated by the two-dimensional Schrödinger equation, Eq. (1) (for 
A(t)=0), and by using the trajectory approximation, Eqs. (4,5). The solution of 
the  former  is  done  by  propagation  of  the  initial  Gaussian  wave  function  in 
imaginary  time  until  steady-state  is  established.  The  trajectory  approach 
represents  essentially  a  Monte-Carlo  simulation  where  the  initial  ensemble 
consists of two randomly distributed sets of coordinates for the two electrons. 
These  distributions  are  Gaussian  and  are  chosen  to  match  the  probability 
distributions  given  by  the  initial  wave  functions 
. 
Then,  for  each  couple  of  electrons  from  the  ensemble  the  two  Schrödinger

equations  (Eq.  (4))  are  propagated  in  complex  time,  while  the  trajectory 
equations  (Eq.  (5))  are  solved  in  real  time.  Note  that  unlike  in  the  standard 
approach complex time is used in Eq. (4) because if the wave function remains 
real-valued  during  the  ground  state  calculation,  the  RHS  in  Eq.  (5)  would  be 
zero  at  all  times.  As  the  steady  state  is  approached  the  imaginary  part  of  the 
ratio in the brackets in Eq. (5) converges to zero together with the velocities of 
the  particles  from  the  ensemble.  As  a  result,  the  steady-state  ground  state 
wave-function matches the statistical distribution of the particle coordinates in 
the  ensemble.  Fig.  2  shows  the  position  space  distribution  of  10 000  two-
particle trajectories after steady state is reached, together with its interpolated 
version.  It  is  seen  that  the  approximate  ground  state  distribution  shows  the 
characteristic “butterfly” shape of the contours where the dents along the x1=x2 
line evidence the presence of an inner and an outer electron. This undoubtedly 
proves the correlated nature of our calculation for the ground state.

The  dynamic  behaviour  of  the  quantum  trajectory  method  is  analyzed 
by irradiating the model atom by a six-cycle laser pulse at frequency ω=0.183 
a.u.  where  the  pulse  is  turned  on  and  off  linearly  within  two  cycles  and  its 
central  part  is  with  constant  amplitude.  Fig.3  displays  the  results  from  the 
numerical solution of Eqs. (1,2), and from Eqs. (4,5), for the same parameters. 
As  usual  [2]  the  trajectories  moving  along  the  axes  are  interpreted  as  single 
ionization,  while  those  far  from  both  axes  are  associated  with  double 
ionization.

The similarity between the exact result and the position space distribution from 
the trajectory simulations shown in Fig.3 is very good. That similarity shows 
that  the  quantum  trajectory  calculation  reproduces  the  essential  correlated 
electron dynamics in the strong field regime.  

An  additional  comparison  between  the  quantum  trajectories  analysis 
and the exact model can be accomplished by calculating the double ionization 
probability  as  function  of  the  laser  intensity.  The  double  ionization  yield  is 
defined  as  the  probability  of  finding  both  electrons  beyond  some  critical 
distance  R  from  the  core  [4].  The  results  from  the  calculation  of  the  double 
ionization probabilities are plotted in Fig.4 for R=12 a.u. It can be seen that the 
trajectory  method  gives  results  for  the  ionization  yield  that  are  close  to  the 
exact results over a range of four orders of magnitude. It was verified that for 
lower  laser  frequencies  the  quantum  trajectories  method  gives  somewhat 
enhanced  ionization  yield  compared  to  the  exact  solution.  This  can  be 
attributed to the one-dimensional model that we use where the particles within 
the correlated couples may get too close to each other in space, which causes 
instabilities in their motion and enhances the ionization. This effect is similar 
to 1D auto-ionization.

The  method  reported  here  can  be  applied  to  quantum  systems  with 
arbitrary number of electrons. The generalization to Hamiltonians that include 
spin and to relativistic calculations is straightforward. One major advantage of 
the  quantum  trajectories  is  that  they  provide  visualization  of  the  quantum 
phenomena which can help to better understand them. It should be noted that 
here  we  use  the  quantum  trajectories  as  a  convenient  computational  tool  and 
ignore the interpretation issues connected with the Bohmian mechanics.

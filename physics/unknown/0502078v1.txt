Abstract 

When  a metallic implant is in contact with human tissues, the organism reacts and a 

corrosion  process  starts.  Consequently,  we  might  observe  liberation  of  metallic 

debris and wear. Our purpose is to measure the contamination and the migration of 

these metallic elements in the surrounding tissues of the implant. 

Two types of samples have been studied. First type is sample taken on post-mortem 

tissues around prostheses to study contamination gradients. Second type is sample 

taken  on  pathologic  joints  on  periprosthetic  capsular  tissues  in  surgical  conditions. 

These allow estimating contamination degree.  

The experiments were made on a Van de Graaff accelerator located at CERI (Centre 

d’Etude  et  de  Recherche  par  Irradiation,  Orléans,  France).  We  measure  elemental 

concentrations  resulting  from  the  contamination  of  the  surface  of  each  sample. 

Results are analysed in function of the pathology and the type of implants.  

According  to  the  pathology  and  the  location  of  the  sampling,  these  measurements 

show  a  very  heterogeneous  contamination  by  metallic  elements  under  particles 

and/or ionic species which can migrate through soft tissues by various mechanisms.

Introduction 

In orthopaedic surgery, metallic implants, like total hip prostheses or total knee 

prostheses,  are  routinely  used  in  articular  diseases.  A  few  years  after  their 

implantations,  some  prostheses  inserted  for  joint  disease  may  show  adverse 

reactions  such  as:  periprosthetic  osteolysis,  instability  of  the  fixation  or  fracture. 

These metallic prostheses may undergo degradations. The influence of metallic ions 

released  on  periprosthetic  tissues  shows  a  significative  issue.  Many  measurements 

were  carried  out  on  blood  and  serum;  however  the  contamination  of  periprosthetic 

tissues is not well understood. A qualitative and quantitative analysis is necessary to 

determine the degree of contamination in soft tissues.  

In this paper, we study contamination induced by metallic element released by 

joint  prostheses.  The  process  of  analysis  of  biological  tissues  requires  the 

examination of different parts. We analyse some tissues near femur, in contact with 

metallic  prostheses,  and  measure  by  sensitive  physical  methods  the  importance  of 

metallic  release  (1).  A  first  experiment  by  neutron  activation  analysis  (NAA) 

demonstrates the contamination of adjacent tissues surrounding implants (2, 3, 1, 4, 

5, and 6). Particles Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) has been used to analyse major, 

minor  and  trace  elements  contained  in  human  tissues.  This  method  evaluates  the 

micrometer  level  metallic  contamination  introduced  by  the  prosthesis  (7,  8,  9,  and 

10).  

  

Materials and methods 

Prostheses analysis by Atomic Emission Spectroscopy  

To identify the type of implanted prosthesis, we have used spark spectrometry. 

The principle of this technique consists in exciting an atom. When this atom returns 

3 

 

 

 

to  the  fundamental  state,  it  releases  energy  as  luminous  radiation  where  the  wave 

number  characterises  the  respected  atom.  A  high  energy  given  by  a  spark  under 

argon with a 15-30 kV voltage volatilises a few quantity of the material. The excitation 

is the result of collisions in the plasma (11).  

Samples preparation 

femoral head. 

We  analyse  two  types  of  samples:  muscular  and  capsular  tissues  near  the 

The  first  one  is  taken  from  anatomical  subjects  (post-mortem  samples  noted 

PMS).  Observations  do  not  show  coloration  induced  by  the  presence  of  metallic 

elements  neither  abnormal  macroscopic  movements  of  the  prosthesis  within  the 

bone.  We  postulate  that  there  are  no  adverse  reactions.  We  analyse  samples  from 

per prosthetic tissues of 5 cases:  

titanium alloy, 

-  PMS1  is  a  specimen  removed  near  a  prosthesis  of  hip  cemented  out  of 

-  PMS2  is  a  tissue  sample  removed  near  a  prosthesis  of  hip,  aiming, 

cemented with a polyethylene cup covered with titanium, 

-  PMS3 and PMS4 result from the same patient but on the right and left hip.  

PMS3 is cemented cobalt alloy prosthesis.  PMS4 is also out of cobalt alloy 

but taken near the prostheses titanium pins. 

-  PMS5  is  a  cemented  prosthesis  out  of  stainless  steel  with  a  polyethylene 

cup.  The tissues in the vicinity are black coloured. 

In these cases, the samples are taken all around the implant at different place locate 

with the number 1 to 6 on Fig.1.  

4 

 

 

The second type of sample is taken during surgical procedures indicated at the time 

of  implant  loosening  or  inflammatory  reactions.  There  are  4  different  prostheses 

(surgical samples noted SS):  

-  SS1  is  a  capsular  tissue  of  hip  removed  near  an  intermediate  prosthesis 

cemented  out  of  stainless  steel  with  a  polyethylene  cup.  The  prosthesis 

was  unstable,  the  tissues  were  black  coloured  and  there  was  osseous 

lysis.  

-  SS2 is a capsule removed around a cemented prosthesis cobalt alloy hip.  

As  previously,  the  prosthesis  is  unstable,  the  tissues  are  black  coloured 

and there is the presence of an osseous lyses,  

-  SS3 and SS4 are two prostheses of titanium alloy hip. SS3 is a cemented 

prosthesis with a ceramic head. At its proximity, there are an osseous lyses 

and a lesion on the surface stem. SS4 is a prosthesis concerned unstable 

covered with alumina. 

For  these  cases,  the  type  of  implant,  the  insertion  period  and  all  symptoms  which 

occurs  the  procedure  of  operation  (inflammatory  reaction,  loosening  of  the  implant, 

instability…) are noted. 

A  control  sample  (SS5)  is  taken  from  capsular  tissue  in  a  patient  at  the  first 

stage of primary hip prosthesis procedure. 

All  the  tissues  are  taken  off  with  a  stainless  steel  scalpel,  which  appears  as 

being the less polluting tool (5). The samples are wrapped in a plastic bag and keep 

in a freezer, waiting for analyses.  

Before analysis, each sample is freeze-dried between two-polyethylene plates 

in order to have a planar surface. This condition is necessary to allow irradiation. In 

5 

 

 

all  cases,  the  thicknesses  of  the  sample  are  2  mm.  They  were  coated  by  a  thin 

carbon layer to reduce charge effects at the surface of the sample during irradiation. 

 

PIXE method 

This  technique  is  based  on  the  X-ray  spectrometry  produced  by  a  charged 

particle  beam  that  irradiates  a  target  (12).  This  method  presents  some  advantages 

comparing to another method like electron fluorescence:  

- the sensitivity is around µg/g (depending of the matrix), 

- it is a multielementary technique, 

- the dimension of the beam is adjustable. 

The  quantitative  analysis  by  PIXE  microprobe  consists  in  measuring  the 

intensity of the characteristic X-rays of the elements in the target and its conversion 

in concentration.  

We have used GUPIX software developed by Campbell (13) to determine the 

concentration  of  metallic  elements  in  the  sample.  Peaks  at  a  given  energy 

characterise an element. 

 

 

Experimental device 

Van  de  Graaff  accelerator  (VDG)  is  located  at  CERI  (Centre  d’Etude  et  de 

Recherche  par  Irradiation,  Orléans,  France).  This  VDG  can  accelerate  protons     

(Fig. 2) with an energy beam of 3 MeV and an intensity of 2 nA. The beam diameter 

is  about  1  mm.  We  make  several  measurements  on  the  target  surface  to  take  into 

account  tissue  heterogeneity.  The  detection  of  X-rays  is  made  with  Si  (Li)  detector 

placed  at  135°  from  the  direction  of  the  incident  beam.  In  front  of  this  detector,  we 

6 

 

 

 

place  a  carbon  filter,  which  has  the  function  to  reduce  the  intensity  of  the  light 

elements, dead time and allows trace element detection.  

Analysis methods 

In order to quantify the contamination, the weighted mean concentration (µg/g) 

of  major  elements  released  from  the  prosthesis  is  calculated  for  each  sample.  We 

make  9  measurements  on  a  given  area  to  have  a  better  representation  of  the 

contamination.    In  table  1  and  2,  <  Cmoy  >  represents  the  weighted  average 

concentration for all the measured points made around the implant. Max (Cmoy) is the 

maximum  concentration  obtained  on  the  surface  in  a  special  location  around  the 

implant.  Max  (C)  is  the  maximum  concentration  of  a  measured  point  that  we  can 

found  around  the  implant.  Most  of  time,  this  point  is  at  the  same  location  that  Max 

(Cmoy). 

The results show a great heterogeneity of measurements which indicates that 

some  points  are  far  from  the  mean.  We  tried  to  separate  this  phenomenon  in  two 

categories.  1)  The  mean  concentration  can  represent  the  global  contamination.        

2)  The  maximum  concentration  can  be  associated  with  the  presence  of  metallic 

fragments.  The  analysis  is  separated  in  two  points:  the  first  one  concerns  post-

mortem samples and the second one surgical sample. 

 

 

I: Post-mortem tissue 

Results  

The analyses of post-mortem tissues near implant (PMS) show the presence 

of metallic elements in adjacent tissues.  

7 

 

 

In  table  3,  the  proportion  of  concentration  above  the  limit  of  detection  is 

presented.  The  results  lie  between  17%  and  70%  over  the  limit  of  detection.  The 

repartition  of  the  metallic  elements  around  the  prosthesis  in  post-mortem  tissues 

shows that the largest migration takes place around the head of the prostheses in the 

trochanteric insertion of muscle (figure 1).  

In the Fig 3, we have represented the 9 measured points for PMS5. The graph 

represents the variation of the contamination on a 9 mm² area. Each point has 1 mm² 

area and all the points are adjacent the one with the other. We have represented Cr, 

Fe, Ni, Mn, Co and Mo which are the major elements of the prostheses. The surface 

analysis  shows  high  variability  in  concentration  between  these  points.  The  highest 

concentration  are  at  the  same  location  for  all  the  tested  elements  (for  instance  the 

coordinates:  3-3;  3-2;  2-3),  but  the  cobalt  shows  high  level  at  another  location  (for 

instance 1-3) which doesn’t correspond to major elements present in the implant (Cr-

In table 1, straightforward results show that on PMS the only significant mean 

concentration  is  found  for  iron.  But  the  observation  of  the  maxima  shows  the 

existence of contamination by metallic elements in particular location.  

Fe-Ni). 

 

 

Discussion 

In most of cases, post-mortem samples present no inflammatory reactions to 

the implant. The mean contamination all around the implant is not significant. But, if 

we consider a particular location, the contamination is more important.  

The  comparison  between  the  maximum  concentration  (Max  (Cmoy))  and  the 

maximum  point  (Max  (C))  shows  that  the  migration  and  the  contamination  are  not 

regular along the implant. The evolution of the contamination depends on the location 

8 

 

 

of the sample. In most cases, the major concentration is observed near the head of 

the  prostheses  in  the  trochanteric  insertion  of  muscle.  In  this  case,  the  distance 

between the tissue and the implant is not so far. This is not the case for the sample 

along  the  stem  where  the  elements  must  cross  cement  and  cortical  bone.  But 

sometimes,  high  contamination  may  be  seen  along the stem: we postulate that it is 

an effect of bone circulation. 

The  studied  stainless  steel  prosthesis  (PMS5)  shows  correlation  between 

chromium, iron and nickel (Fig 3). The proportion of these metals compared to those 

found  in  prostheses  (table  4)  gives  information  about  possible  correlations  between 

different  elements.  So  we  can  conclude  that  we  are  in  presence  of  fragments  or 

cluster because of the ratios which are much closed to them of the prosthesis. 

 

II: Surgical samples 

Results  

The study of tissue of reference carries out under the same conditions as for 

pathological  fabrics.  The  metallic  elements  present  are  iron  and  zinc.  Other  metals 

are below the limit of detection of our method (<20 µg/g). 

Table  2  shows  concentrations  obtained  on  surgical  samples.  The  main 

constitutive  elements  of  the  implants  are  found  in  surrounding  tissues.  Special 

mention  must  be  made  for  chromium  in  SS1  and  SS2  and  cobalt  in  SS2.  Although 

titanium is found around SS1 (Stainless steel). Iron is always at a high level whatever 

the implant is, maybe due to blood.  

Table 3 shows the proportion of concentration above the limit of detection and 

the  results  show  that  four  of  the  five  surgical  samples  have  element  concentration 

9 

 

 

 

over  70%.  The  difference  of  percentage  varies  according  to  the  pathology  and  the 

state of the sample (black coloured or not).  

In table 5, comparison of major metallic ratio between prosthesis and surgical 

tissue  has  been  made  and  show  a  good  correlation  for  chromium-iron  and  nickel-

iron, but less good correlation when chromium and nickel are concerned.  

 

Discussion 

Results  show  that  the  contamination  of  adjacent  tissues  depends  on  the 

implant.  The  mean  concentrations  are  not  very  high  comparing  to  the  maximum. 

These averages mask points of high concentration (table 1 and 2). By comparison of 

metallic  ratio,  there  is  good  agreement  between  Cr/Fe  and  Ni/Fe.  Concerning  the 

Cr/Ni,  the  ratio  is  upper  in tissue to the prosthesis. This can be due to the fact that 

there is a high chromium concentration in tissue or less concentration in nickel. It can 

be a consequence of the evolution of these elements in organism, if they are stocked 

by cells or if they are transfer towards other organs to be eliminated. 

We observe that the contamination is not regular and depends on the type of 

implant and the state of the tissue. For surgical samples, the patient had a reaction to 

the prostheses. The presence of metallic elements is important and may correspond 

to  a  contamination  due  to  the  corrosion  of  the  tissue.  If  the  contamination  is 

homogeneous  on  a  surface  and  if  the  quantity  of  element  doesn’t  appear  as 

important,  it  might  correspond  to  an  ionic  contamination.  Higher  concentration  may 

point out another possible type of contaminations resulting from the release of wear 

metallic fragment. Whatever the case, the majority of the contamination is above the 

limit of detection (Table 1, Table 2).  

Conclusion 

10 

 

 

The  corrosion  has  already  been  studied  by  Betts  and  Shalgaldi  (14,  15). 

Effects  of  metallic  elements  released  by  prostheses  on  biological  behaviour  was 

described  by  Allen  (16)  as  well  as  the  contamination  in  other tissues was observed 

by  Henning,  Schnabel  &  Urban  (17,  6,  18)  and  contamination  of  body  fluids  by  Liu 

(19).  In  this  work,  we  have  measured  the  contamination  in  the  adjacent  tissue 

induced by metallic implants and we confirm the contamination by metallic elements 

in periprosthetic tissues. 

 

The study of the control sample, where there is no metallic implant, indicates 

that  the  method  used  to  take  and  to  conserve  the  samples  does  not  induce 

contamination (5). Furthermore, preliminary trials show that the irradiation times have 

no effect on the concentration.  

To  show  different  types  of  contamination,  an  analytical  method  has  been   

used  (20).  The  weighted  average  concentration  permits  to  evaluate  the  quantity  of 

metallic  elements  contained  in  tissues.  The  separation  in  two  categories  of 

measurements  investigates  the  heterogeneity  of  repartition.  In  the  case  of  post-

mortem  samples,  the  major  contamination  seems  to  come  from  ionic  species. 

Concerning  surgical  tissues,  the  metallic  element  concentration  is  higher  and 

migration  of  wear  debris  is  presumed.  This  can  explain  that  post-mortem  tissues 

concern patient who had no prosthesis problem, no inflammatory reaction even when 

in  surgery,  the  patient  can  have  a  reaction  against  the  implant.  The  elements 

released  from  the  prostheses might be eliminated from the organism by cells. Sites 

with  high  concentrations  can  correspond  to  accumulation  of  the  elements  or  can 

result from an exterior contribution. On the other hand, in surgical samples a higher 

correlation between elements is observed. It demonstrates the possible presence of 

fragments. 

11 

 

 

The differences between the mean concentration (< Cmoy >) and the maximum 

(Max (Cmoy)) are smaller in surgical samples than in post-mortem tissues. This result 

comes from the heterogeneity and points of high concentration.  

If  we  look  for  correlation  between  elements,  in  most  of  the  cases,  all  the 

metals are present at the same location and the metallic ratio is nearly the same than 

in the prosthesis. The presence of these elements has already been studied by SEM 

and  TEM  methods  (21,  22).  In  this  study,  we  were  looking  for  the  quantification  of 

these  phenomenons  with  sensitive  physical  methods.  The  distribution  of  these 

metallic elements on a surface near the implant has been investigated. However, the 

evolution  of  the  metal  released  through  the  muscle  to  other  tissues  should  be 

analysed  to  give  more  information  about  the  migration.  Complementary  studies  are 

needed  to  conclude  on  contamination  nature  and  depth.  We  are  looking  for 

correlation between major elements that could detect prosthesis fragments.

Abstract 

 
In this work, near-field imaging by two strongly coupled arrays of split ring resonators 
is analyzed. A simple theoretical model is developed to obtain the transfer function of 
the  lens.  This  model  shows  that  magnetoinductive  surface  waves  (MISWs)  play  the 
same  role  as  plasmon-polaritons  in  negative  refractive  slabs.  In  particular,  the  model 
predicts that the image is formed near the resonant frequency of the rings, between the 
pass-bands for the two MISW branches that can be excited in the lens. It also predicts a 
significant  image  enhancement  when  the  distance  between  the  source  source  and  the 
image  plane  is  smaller  than  twice  the  lens  width.  The  predictions  of  the  theoretical 
model are supported by measurements in the radio-frequency range. This suggests the 
possibility of using this kind of devices to imaging processes in the megahertz range, as 
for example in magnetic resonance imaging. 
 
 I. INTRODUCTION 
 
After the seminal works of Veselago [1] and Pendry [2], imaging by metamaterial slabs 
became an active area of research. Although losses may substantially degrade this effect 
[3], they do not prevent the onset of sub-diffraction images in near field experiments [4-
6].  In  fact,  near  field  sub-diffraction  imaging  by  metamaterial  slabs  [2]  has  been 
reported in experiments carried out with a two dimensional circuit analogous of a left-
handed  medium  [7],  a  single-cell-depth  left-handed  slab  [8],  a  silver  slab  operating  at 
optical frequencies [9], a pair of magneto-inductive surfaces [10], and a photonic crystal 
flat lens [11]. In addition, it has been theoretically predicted for ferrite slabs [12] and in 
a  pair  of  coupled  resonant  impedance  surfaces  [13].  The  main  aim  of  this  paper  is  to 
further develop the analysis of the magneto-inductive (MI) lens previously reported by 
the authors [10]. In particular, the role of MI surface waves for the image formation will 
be  clarified,  and  the  field  distribution  around  the  image  will  be  studied.  Some 
interesting physical effects, such as the image enhancement at the back side of the lens, 
are also reported. 
 
The aforementioned MI lens is a near-field imaging device that can be designed to work 
at frequencies ranging from megahertz to terahertz. The MI lens consists of two parallel 
planar  periodic  arrays  of  inductively  coupled  resonators.  A  key  concept  in  near-field 
sub-diffraction  imaging  is  the  amplification,  inside  the  lens,  of  evanescent  spatial 
Fourier  harmonics  (FHs)  coming  from  the  source.  This  amplification  produce  the 
restoration  of  the  FHs  amplitude  at  the  image  plane  [2],  thus  allowing  for  the  image 
formation. In the analyzed MI lens, such amplification process is closely related to the 
excitation  of  MI  surface  waves  (MISWs)  [14]  at  each  individual  array  of  resonators 
[10]. However, such MISWs do not correspond to the MISWs that can be excited in the 

device. In fact, when two arrays are coupled in order to form the MI lens, the MISWs 
dispersion relation splits into two branches, with pass-bands above and below the pass-
band  of  the  original  MISW  of  the  isolated  array.  The  excitation  of  anyone  of  these 
MISW branches is undesirable for image formation, because it would imply radiation in 
the plane of the device, as well as image distortion by the disproportionate contribution 
of  such  resonances.  A  similar  conclusion  was  previously  reported  regarding  plasmon-
polariton  excitation  in  imaging  devices  made  of  negative  permittivity  slabs  [15].  In 
order to avoid such undesirable effect, the coupling between both arrays of resonators 
must  be  strong  enough  to  produce  a  clear  separation  between  the  pass-bands  of  both 
MISW  branches.  When  this  condition  is  achieved,  the  image  is  expected  to  appear  at 
some  frequency  between  the  pass-bands  for  both  MISW  branches.  For  this  reason, 
strongly coupled arrays of resonators are considered in this work. 
 
In order to develop the analysis, a surface impedance model is proposed for each array 
of  resonators.  The  transfer  function  of  the  lens  is  obtained  following  the  method 
previously  proposed  by  Maslovski[13].  The  aforementioned  MISW  branches  will 
appear  as  poles  of  this  transfer  function.  Between  such  poles,  a  flat  transfer  function 
with  an  almost  constant  value  near  unity  at  the  image  plane  will  be  found,  thus 
justifying the image formation. In order to obtain the best resolution, the source plane 
will  be  located  at  a  distance  from  the  lens  equal  to  the  distance  between  the  arrays. 
Thus, the image is formed just at the exit of the lens. This configuration reduces losses 
in the arrays, and is optimal from the resolution standpoint[16]. It has been previously 
used  in  other  sub-diffraction  image  experiments,  carried  out  in  the  optical  range  of 
frequencies [9]. The effect on the image of variations in the distance between the source 
and the lens is also studied. A significant image enhancement will be obtained when the 
source approaches the lens, in agreement with some previous theoretical results [17]. 
 
Experiments  have  been  carried  out  in  order  to  validate  our  theoretical  analysis.  Such 
experiments are aimed to the direct measurement of the field at the image plane, i.e. at 
the exit o the lens. Regarding such measurements, care must be taken in order to avoid 
artifacts  coming  from  the  matching  capabilities  of  the  lens  [18,19].  It  was  already 
mentioned that sub-diffraction image formation is based on the amplification, inside the 
lens, of evanescent FHs coming from the source. Since there is no power flux associated 
with  an  evanescent  FH,  this  amplification  does  not  violates  energy  conservation  [2]. 
However,  any  field  measurement  implies  some  flux  of  energy.  Thus,  if  unappropriate 
detectors are used, the measurement procedure will substantially affect the field at the 
image,  and  the  behavior  of  the  lens  may  be  closer  to  a  tunneling  device  than  to  a 
imaging  device[19].  Although  such  tunneling  effect  may  be  of  interest  for  some 
applications, it must be avoided for the particular purpose of this work. I order to avoid 
such effect, it has been used small detectors with an impedance sufficiently smaller than 
the characteristic impedance of the input/output waveguides of the measurement device. 
This choice ensures that the measurements actually correspond to a direct measurement 
of the field created behind the lens by the source alone [19]. 
 
II. THEORY 
 
The  MI  lens  analyzed  in  this  work  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  It  is  formed  by  two  planar 
periodic  arrays  of  capacitively  loaded  open  rings  (CLORs),  placed  at  a  distance  d 
between them. The transfer function for the device is obtained following the procedure 
already reported by Maslovski [13]. Although the main steps for this computation were 

already  described  in  such  paper,  they  will  be  briefly  outlined  here  for  completeness. 
Using the same notation as in Maslovski's work [13], the complex amplitudes of waves 
travelling  (or  decaying)  in  opposite  directions  across  the  device  are  related  by  a  2x2 
transmission matrix as:

In the experiments reported in this work, the image plane is fixed at the exit of the lens, 
and  the  source  plane  is  placed  at  a  certain  distance  from  the  lens  (as  it  was  already 
mentioned, this configuration is optimal from the resolution standpoint[16]). Taking this 
into account, the transmission matrix  Ttot can be written as

In the MI lens the resonators are excited by the ]z-]component of the external magnetic 
field  Hext  imposed  by  the  source.  For  our  analysis  it  is  then  convenient  to  obtain  the 
relation between Hext,z and Eext. This relation directly follows from Faraday’s law, i.e.:

where kt =kx x+ ky y is the wavevector along the array. Next, on the array, the averaged

into account the inter resonators coupling. Thus, taking into account (11) and (12), Zc

of the MI waves propagating in a single 2D-array of resonators under the influence of 
the  external  magnetic  field.  This  dispersion  relation  can  be  obtained  from  the  circuit

Thus,  after  substituting  (16)  and  (17)  in  (13)  and  (7),  the  transmission  coefficient  or 
transfer function as given in (2) is calculated. 
 
Fig. 2.a shows a typical plot of the transfer function T(ω,kx,ky=0). The parameters used 
for the calculation are the same as in the experiments reported in the next section. They 
are  given  in  the  caption  of  the  figure.  The  ring  inductance  was  obtained  from  the 
experimental  frequency  of  resonance  of  the  rings,  ω0,  through  ω0=(LC)-1/2,  and  the 
mutual  inductance  was  estimated  by  assuming  that  each  ring  is  seen  by  its  closest 
neighbors as a point dipole. The peaks in the plot correspond to the direct excitation of 
the  two  MISWs  supported  by  the  device.  A  flat  region  of  T  ~1  can  be  clearly 
appreciated  between  such  peaks.  From  these  results  it  is  apparent  that,  for  imaging 
applications, the operating frequency of the lens must be chosen between the pass-bands 
of  both  MISWs,  close  to  the  resonant  frequency  of  the  rings,  ω0=137.5  MHz.  The 

transfer function T(ω ,kx,ky=0) at ω=140 MHz is shown in Fig. 2.b. It can be clearly seen 
that this transfer function is very close to unity for almost all values of the wavenumber 
kx. It is worth to mention that, if the distance between the arrays supporting the MISWs 
increases, both MISWs branches get closer, and the frequency region where the transfer 
function  is  flat  gets  narrower.  If  the  arrays  are  far  enough,  the  MISW  bands  overlaps 
around  the  resonant  frequency  of  the  rings,  and  the  imaging  capabilities  of  the  lens 
disappear.  This  effect  limits  the  MI  lens  thickness  and,  therefore,  the  distance  over 
which a source can be imaged. 
 
III. EXPERIMENT 
 
The  model  reported  in  the  previous  section  has  been  checked  by  an  experiment.  For 
such experiment a MI lens, operating in the radio-frequency range, was fabricated. The 
lens  consisted  of  two  plane  arrays  of  CLORs,  placed  parallel  and  separated  by  a 
distance d=4.5 mm. The periodicity of the arrays is a=12.5 mm. Each array has 14x14 
resonators  that  have  been  fabricated  by  photoetching  planar  open  metallic  loops  on  a 
low-loss  dielectric  substrate.  Surface  mounted  capacitors  (nominally  C=82  pF)  have 
been soldered in the gap of each loop. The external diameter of each loop is 1 cm, and 
the width of the metallic strips is 1 mm. The experimental setup, including a detail of 
the ring resonators, is shown in Fig. 1. The frequencies of resonance of the rings on the 
array were measured, and it was found that all of them fall inside the range ω/2π= 137.5  
MHz (within a 2\%). The ring self-inductance was calculated from this value, and from 
the  value  of  the  aforementioned  capacitance  C=82  pF.  This  calculation  provided  the 
value  L=16.3  nH.  The  source  was  a  square  shaped  narrow  parallel-strips  transmission 
line, short circuited at the end. This source is shown in Fig. 3. The total length of the 
transmission line is approximately 8a=10 cm, much smaller than the wavelength at 140 
MHz, which is around 200 cm. Therefore, the current can be considered almost uniform 
along the transmission line. The parallel-wire line was sharp bended in order to produce 
a strong and uniform square-shaped magnetic field crest in the source plane. Each side 
length of this square-shaped crest is 2 a (a is the distance between two consecutive rings 
in  the  MI  lens).  The  probe  used  for  field  measurements  was  the  small  loop  antenna 
shown in Fig. 3. The loop radius was 4 mm., and the measured input reactance of such 
antenna was 10.7 Ω, well below the value of the characteristic impedance of the input 
and output coaxial waveguides Z0 =50 Ω. This value  of the loop reactance ensures that 
the transmission coefficient between the source and the probe actually corresponds to a 
measurement of the field [19]. In the experiments,  the source is  placed in front of the 
lens (at different distances from it), so that the magnetic crest passes through the centers 
of 8 consecutive rings, leaving a single ring at its center (see Fig. 3). The image plane is 
fixed  at  the  exit  interface  of  the  lens  (as  it  was  already  mentioned,  this  configuration 
improves the resolution [16]). For the measurements, the probe is consecutively placed 
at the center of each ring, at the exit interface of the lens. The measured transmission 
coefficient between the source and the probe provides a map of the field at the image 
plane.  An  Agilent  Technologies  Network  Analyzer  E8363B  was  used  to  measure  the 
transmission coefficient between the source and the probe. 
 
Before  to  proceed  with  the  direct  measurement  of  any  image,  the  frequency  at  which 
such image is formed must be determined. For this purpose, the probe was placed at the 
center  of  the  ring  placed  just  at  the  center  of  the  source.  A  plot  of  the  measured 
frequency dependence of the transmission coefficient is shown in Fig. 4. We interpret 
that the two peaks centered at 130 MHz and 150 MHz correspond to the excitation of 

the two MISWs branches predicted by Fig. 2. The middle point in the curve of Fig. 4 
corresponds to a frequency of approximately 140 MHz, which is also the frequency for 
the  theoretical  plot  in  Fig.  2.b.  Once  the  frequency  for  the  image  formation  was 
determined, the image formed at the exit interface of the lens, with the source placed at 
different distances, was measured. The results of such measurements at the frequency of 
140  MHz,  made  following  the  method  described  above,  are  shown  in  Fig.  5.  Fig.  5.a 
shows a map of the field intensity at the source plane, without the lens. Fig. 5.b shows a 
map of the field intensity at the exit interface of the lens, when the source is placed at a 
distance  2d  from  this  interface.  Finally,  Fig.  5.c  shows  a  map  of  the  field  at  the  exit 
interface of the lens, when the source is placed at a distance of 1.5d from such interface. 
The  scale  in  all  Figures  is  the  same  and,  for  data  collection,  the  probe  was  moved  by 
identical steps (of length a) along the co-ordinate axes in the plane of the measurements. 
The formation of a clear image of the source can be observed in Fig. 5.b, where it can 
be  also  seen  that  the  field  intensity  at  the  source  is  approximately  reproduced  at  the 
image. This results is in complete agreement with the theoretical  model. The “image” 
seen  in  Fig.  5.c  seems  to  reproduce  approximately  the  form  of  the  source,  but  with  a 
substantial enhancement (at the cost of some distortion) of the field intensity. 
 
In order to have a better picture of the lens resolution, the field intensity along the line 
marked in Fig. 3, at different distances, is plotted in Fig. 6. For comparison purposes, 
two plots of the field intensity along this line at a distance 2d from the source, and in the 
source  plane,  are  also  included  in  the  Figure.  The  curve  corresponding  to  the  field 
intensity  measured  at  the  exit  interface  of  the  lens,  when  the  source  is  placed  at  a 
distance  2d  from  this  interface,  approximately  matches  the  curve  showing  the  field 
intensity  at  the  source  plane.  This  fact  corroborates  the  theoretical  predictions  about 
image formation in the MI lens. The curves corresponding to smaller distances between 
the  source  and  the  image,  clearly  show  an  enhancement  of  the  image,  which  is  in 
agreement with some previous theoretical predictions [20], and may be useful for some 
practical applications. Finally, the overall effect of the lens on the image formation can 
be  appreciated  by  comparing  with  the  curve  showing  the  field  intensity  in  air,  at  a 
distance 2d from the source (in the absence of the lens). 
 
It  is  of  interest  to  investigate  the  behavior  of  the  lens  at  those  frequencies  where  the 
MISWs shown in Fig. 4 can be excited. The “image” formed when the source is placed 
at a distance 2d from the image plane (the exit interface of the lens) is shown in Fig. 7 
for  the  frequency  of  130MHz.  It  can  be  clearly  seen  that,  in  spite  of  the  high 
transmission level at the central ring, the image is not formed at all. This result clearly 
shows the importance of avoiding the excitation of MISWs if good images are desired. 
For this purpose, both arrays must be strongly coupled, so that the frequency band-pass 
of both MSSWs do not overlap. This fact is the main limitation for manufacturing MI 
lens  with  larger  thickness,  which  would  allow  for  image  formation  at  larger  distances 
from the source.  For this purpose,  it  will  be desirable to reduce the band-width of the 
MISWs supported by the lens. Since this band-width is mainly given by the M/L ratio 
[14],  a  good  strategy  may  be  to  design  magnetic  resonators  with  higher  self-
inductances, while keeping constant the mutual inductance. The use of swiss-rolls [20] 
instead  of  capacitively  loaded  open  rings  seems  to  be  a  promising  alternative  in  such 
direction. Future works will explore this and other possibilities. 
 
 
 

IV.CONCLUSION 
 
Image  formation  in  MI  lenses  has  been  studied  theoretically  and  experimentally.  A 
theoretical  model  has  been  developed,  which  predicts  the  main  features  of  image 
formation in such lenses. This model makes clear the analogy existing between surface 
plasmons in negative refractive slabs and MISWs waves in MI lenses. A key conclusion 
of the model is that, for a correct image formation, the MI lens should be thin enough to 
avoid  the  overlapping  of  the  two  MISWs  branches  supported  by  the  lens.  If  this 
condition is fulfilled, the model shows that the image is formed at frequencies near the 
resonant  frequency  of  the  rings,  where  no  MISWs  can  be  excited  in  the  device.  The 
theoretical model has been validated by experiments showing the image formation at the 
predicted  frequencies.  They  also  showed  how  the  lens  losses  its  imaging  properties  at 
those  frequencies  where  MISWs  are  excited  in  the  device.  Such  experiments  also 
showed a significant image enhancement when the distance between the source and the 
image  planes  is  smaller  than  twice  the  lens  thickness.  In  our  opinion,  the  reported 
theoretical  and  experimental  results  open  the  door  for  the  design  of  practical  sub-
diffraction  imaging  devices  in  the  megahertz  range  of  frequencies,  which  may  be  of 
interests for magnetic resonance imaging applications.

experiment with the source placed at a distance 2d is the lens thickness) from the image 
plane,  at  the  exit  of  the  lens.  The  transfer  function  is  calculated  for  the  following 
parameters: a=12.5  mm,  R=0.04  Ω,  C=82  pF,  L=16.3  nH,  ω/2π=137.5  MHz  and  M=-
0.015 L (the mutual inductance is negative because the magnetic field originating in a 
ring  must  change  direction  in  order  to  cross  another  ring).  The  external  radius  of  the 
resonator is 5 mm and the width of the ring is 1 mm, so that the effective area of the 
resonator  is  S0=πr2,  where  an  averaged  radius  r=4.5  mm  is  considered.  (b):  Two- 
dimensional plot of the transfer function at ω/2π=140 MHz.

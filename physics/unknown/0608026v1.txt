Abstract 
 

I  demonstrate  two  fundamental  contributions.  First,  the  Earth  tectonics  is  generally  a 
consequence  of  the  springtide-induced  magnification  of  mechanical  resonance  in  the  Earth’s 
mantle.  The  same  mechanism  that  causes  bridges  to  collapse  under  the  soldiers  step-
marching  makes  also the Earth’s lithosphere  fail under the springtide-induced  magnification 
of the mantle resonance resulting in strong earthquakes. Secondly, by generalizing the above 
finding  onto  any  body  anywhere  in  all  the  Universes  and  at  all  times,  I  find  that  there  is  no 
distinction  between  physics  at  intergalactic,  Newtonian,  quantum,  and  smaller  scales.  Thus, 
the so-called constant of proportionality of physics, G, is not a constant but a parameter of a 
most  general  form:  G  =  s  ·  e^2,  nonlinearly  varying  amongst  different  scales  s.    Any  scale-
related variations of physics, erroneously recognized as such by Einstein and Planck, are only 
apparent  and  arise  as  a  consequence  of  the  Earth  mantle’s  springtide-induced  extreme 
resonance,  which  is  also  critically  impeding  any  terrestrial  experiments  aimed  at  estimating 
the final proportionality G.

1. Introduction: Gravimetric 
Terrestrial Spectroscopy 
 
I  use  superconducting  gravimeter  (SG) 
1Hz observations to show that the Earth is 
a  simple  forced  mechanical  oscillator  in 
which  resonant  magnification  of  Earth 
total-mass (mostly the mantle) oscillation 
occurs.  This  means 
the  Earth 
tectonics  and  related  phenomena  are 
mechanically  caused,  and  not  thermo-
nuclear-chemically 
previously 
hypothesized.    The  lunar  synodic  semi-
monthly  forcing  drives  incessantly  the 
long-periodic  (between  12-120  minutes) 
oscillation magnitudes of the Earth’s total 
mass.  In  addition,  total-mass  oscillation 
magnitudes  correlate  up  to  0.97  with 
seismic energies on the day of shallow and 
3  days  before  deep  earthquakes.  The 
forced-oscillator  equations  for  the  Earth 
mantle’s  usual  viscosity,  the  Earth  grave 
mode  and  the  lunar  synodic  half-month 
successfully 
(14.7655  days)  periods,

The state and perturbations of all the 
Earth  masses, 
including  atmosphere, 
ocean,  land,  and  interior,  are  of  interest 
here.  Since  the  mass  of  gas,  water,  rock, 
mantle,  and  core  together  account  for 
Earth  gravity,  hence  information  equals 
signal. Such a concept is justified by work 
of  [14]  who  established  the  usefulness  of 
(wave)

information 
the  Earth’s 
for  studying 
interior. Of all SG locations, the Canadian 
one  was  the  best  for this purpose, as it is 
antipodal  to  the  seismically  most  active 
region  on  Earth  –  the  Pacific  Rim.  This 
ensured  that  the  signal  strength  was 
maximal. Thus, the whole Earth is studied 
by  means  of  raw  gravity  observations 
(further:  gravity  observations)  that  are 
neither stripped of tides nor corrected for 
environmental  effects.  This 
can  be 
achieved  by  looking  into  Earth  gravity 
spectra from the band of Earth all masses’ 
long  eigenperiods  12–120  min,  or  low 
eigenfrequencies  12–120  cycles  per  day

important  advantages,  GVSA  was  a  more 
suitable technique for GTS than any of the 
typically  used  tools  such  as  the  Fourier 
spectral  analysis  [21,22].    GVSA  seemed 
most  apt  for  GTS  primarily  due  to:  (i) 
ability  to  handle  gaps  in  data  [23],  (ii) 
straightforward  significance  level  regime 
[24],  and  (iii)  distinctive  and  virtually 
unambiguous  depiction  of  background 
noise  levels  [13].    These  advantages  make 
GVSA  a  unique  field  descriptor  that  can 
accurately  and  simultaneously  estimate 
both  the  structural  eigenfrequencies  and 
field  relative  dynamics.    Over  the  past 
in 
thirty  years,  GVSA  was  applied

many  of  the  tidal  triggering  claims  have

sufficient power to trigger earthquakes. [7] 
did not even make reference to fortnightly 
periods  in  discussing  tidal  triggering, 
while [8] questioned [5] proposing that it be 
tested “whether it is the oscillatory nature 
of  tidal  stress  –  rather  than  its  small 
magnitude – that inhibits triggering” [8].  A 
century  of  “tidal  triggering”  reports  is

for filtering the  SG gravity data in a non-

step gaps were accounted for by Boolean-
weighting each measurement. This filter’s 
response  stayed  well  above  90  var%  over

Hence  using  surface  magnitudes  rather

to a small number of relatively large input

In  all  three  Earth-models  tested, 
gravity-seismicity correlations were higher 
when  seismic  energies  were  used  rather 
than seismic magnitudes, as well as when 
variance  spectra  were  used  rather  than 
power  spectra.  Also,  the  more  recent 
model produced higher correlation in case 
of  deep  earthquakes.  Superconducting 
gravimeters can sense globally minute (in 
the  order  of  0.01  var%)  mass  re-
distributions  of  the  inner  masses,  and 
contrary  to  some  opinions,  such  as  for 
instance  [43]),  depending  on  the  choice  of 
signal  and  noise 
removal  of 
atmospheric  and  other  environmental 
effects  is  not  necessary  for  all  purposes.

noise was cleared from the record to begin 
with. Also, the processing did not amplify 
these  two  periods  as  it,  in  fact,  was 
designed  to  suppress  all  the  contents  at 
around  half  a  month  (Fig.  3).    Thus,  the 
two periods are not in the SG data per sé, 
and the entire data, i.e., the field that they 
sample,  oscillate  with  those  two  periods. 
This sort of sensitivity was attainable due 
to  SG  accuracy  (as  discussed  earlier) 
appreciably  exceeding  the  ratio  between 
the 
force  of  Earth  gravity  and  the 
maximum  lunar  tidal  force,  of  ~1.14:10–7  
[48].  Obviously, since we speak of gravity, 
the  inclusion  of  gravity  components  that 
are due to non-solid Earth masses such as 
the atmosphere, as well as of those in the 
deep  interior  had  little  importance  in 
inflating  these  two  periods  –  due  to  low 
density  and  due  to  distance  from  the 
lithosphere,  respectively.    Here,  normal 
eigenperiods  were  used  because  they  are 
the  natural  beat  periods  of  all  Earth 
masses (further: Earth total mass, mostly 
the  mantle)  that  comprise  gravity  and 
cause  Earth  oscillations  in  general,  not 
just  Earth  free  oscillation.  I  therefore 
checked the periodicity obtained along all 
normal mode periods (Fig. 4), against the 
result  from  using  complete  environment 
information  (Fig.  5).    As  seen  above,  this 
yielded 
lunar  period  with  an 
astounding  accuracy,  confirming  in  effect 
the  starting  premise  on  both  the  SG 
accuracy and GTS validity. 

the 

oscillates with springtide periods, so Earth 
oscillation is not just free but constrained 
as well; meaning rather than observing the 
response  of  the  Earth  as  a  system  under 
exclusively free (particle) motion, as it has 
been  done  in  geophysics  so  far  [41],  this 
specific  model  requires  that  the  response 
of  the  Earth  system  under  forced  motion 
be observed instead. Then in such a global 
forced  oscillator,  first  proposed  by  [49], 
where  the  damping  force  is  proportional 
to the velocity of the body [28], Earth grave 
mode 0P2 is the system normal period, and 
the  lunar  synodic  period  is  the  system 
forcing period due to which the states of a 
maximum oscillation magnification and a 
maximum  stored  potential  energy  occur 
[50].

Band 2 day – 5 yr.  Spectral resolution 50,000 pt. 
 

Increasing the spectral resolution to 
50,000  pt  yielded  an  estimate  to  better 
than  3  minutes  of  the  above  period,  as 
14.7655  days  at  95%  confidence  level. 
According  to  Eq.  (7),  this  represents  an 
accuracy  of  ~17  seconds  or  twice  the  size 
of the filtering step.  Thus, a considerably 
improved estimate of the periodicity of the 
Earth  gravity  oscillation  can  be  obtained 
when  complete  environment  information 
is  used,  as  well  as  after  the  spectral 
resolution  is  enhanced;  25  times  in  this 
case.

The  springtide  exerts  pull  on  all 
Earth  masses.  In  case  of  the  mantle’s 
plastic environment, this would affect the 
mantle  where  the  mantle  is  weakest,  i.e., 
along the 300-400 km deep astenosphere-

highest  correlation  was  at  the  ~821  sec

Inserting       To = 821 sec into Eqs. (8) and

shift.    This  is  a  real-Earth  constraint  on 
the proposed model, as the < 1-day phase 
shift,  if  applicable  to  real  Earth,  would 
contribute  to  the  facts  that  (a)  shallow

According to the Moon-forced Earth 
oscillator model, when a tectonic structure 
(mostly the mantle and to a lesser degree 
the  crust)  starts  resonating  in  harmony 
with  the  Moon-Earth  orbital  tone,  the 
material  of  which  those  structures  are 
composed  crumbles,  resulting 
in  an 
earthquake.  The  forced  oscillator  model 
also  agrees  with  the  well  known  fact  that 
shallow  and  deep  earthquakes  are 
observed  as  belonging  to  two  different 
processes:  plastic  and  rock  environments 
have  radically  different  structure  and 
therefore considerably different structural 
eigenfrequencies  as  well  –  the  longer  the 
object’s  eigenperiods the shorter the time 
for  the  object  under  forced  oscillation 
magnification  to  fall  apart.  Then  the 
forced  global  oscillator  model  could 
perhaps apply to deep seismicity. 

As  [55]  recently  found,  mantle  melts 
take  only  a  few  decades  to  generate, 
transfer,  accumulate  and  erupt,  opposite

to  previous  estimates  of  ~103  yrs.    The 
herein  proposed  model  could  perhaps 
offer  a  mechanism  for  rapid  transport  of 
mantle  melt:  in  the  proposed  model 
tectonics  is  merely  a  consequence  of  the 
resonating  mantle’s  fast  dynamics  at  a 
swift rate that equals the time which takes 
for the (3-days) phase to start affecting the 
SG sensitivity. 

In the realm of the proposed simple 
model, I thus demonstrated the following 

 

 

Rule: 
The ratio of seismic energy ES and total 
kinetic energy EK on Earth is constant. 

 
 
Based  on  the  above-defined  model 
and  its  own  rule  (a  claim  that holds  only 
under  some  strict  conditions;  a  law  in  a 
non-strict sense), I propose the following 

Physical hypothesis “B”: 
Earth tectonics and inner-core 
differential rotation arise due to 
respective upward and downward 
continuations of the springtide-induced 
magnification of the resonant 
dynamics of the mantle.

Importantly,  Eqs.  (8)  - (11)  produce 
nonsensical  results  for  the  Earth–Sun 
system.  That  is  in  agreement  with  the 
above  forced  global  oscillator  model, 
since,  unlike  the  Moon  the  Sun  “orbits” 
about  the  Earth  only  apparently.    This 
further legitimizes the proposed model by 
providing relevance for the real Earth.

the ideas of [6] and [7] that are here used as

discard the latter option (ii) above.  Then 
the proposed model does not allow for the

7. Corollary 
 
I  deduce  that  the  lunar  forcing  Fig.  5 
enables the natural vibration of the Earth 
total-mass  (mostly  the  mantle).  Then  in 
the limiting case of Eq. (12), when T max = 
14.7655 days period is used along with the 
natural period of the Earth total mass, an 
over-scaling  (numerical)  relationship  is 
asserted 
the 
Newtonian vs. Planck scales, i.e., between 
the Newtonian constant of gravitation (or: 
constant  of  proportionality  of  physics  at 
Newtonian scales),                   | GNewton | = 
(6.6742 ± 0.001)·10-11, c.f. NIST.GOV, and

suggesting that there is no real distinction 
between  physics  at  the  Newtonian  and 
Planck  scales.  If  the  relationship  (13)  is 
real,  its  analytical  uncertainty  ε1  must 
depend only on the uncertainties of G and 
ωo. 

Analogously,  there  is  no  need  for 
invoking  the  Riemannian  geometry  in  a 
global  forced  oscillator.  Within  the  scope 
of  the  proposed  model,  the  existence  of 
new  frequency-space  approaches  to  the 
unified  theory  could be feasible via using 
non-relativistic quantum mechanics alone 
– by equating the concepts of Earth mass 
and  charge  whereas  the  charge  is  subject 
to the lunar forcing just like all the masses 
that comprise the Earth charge are, Fig. 5.  
[49]  maintained  that  reality  is  completely

string  theory.  Newton  attached  units  to 
the constant of proportionality G in order 
to  complete  his  theory.  As  viewed  in  the 
here-proposed realm, that close occurs in 
order  for  the  Newton’s  (Einstein’s)  linear 
misconstruction  of  the  frequency-space 
reality to be satisfied. Therefore, regarded 
as  a  ratio,  G  is  a  quantity  that  carries  no

Inserting  (18)  back  into  the  relationship 
(13) gives 2·10-4 for the uncertainty of the 
relationship  (13),  clearly  reflecting  only 
the higher-order terms in Eq. (7), and the 
NIST  relative  standard  uncertainty  for

Note the excellent agreement for the

This  made  the  analytical  uncertainty  in 
case  of  the  Planck  scales  (ε2)  somewhat 
improve  compared  to  (15)  albeit  not 
drastically.  Thus,  according 
the 
proposed  model,  an  inequality  C  II  ≠  C  I  
holds, meaning the first two types of scales 
bear  different  but  similar  properties.  In 
case  of  the  Einsteinean  (intergalactic) 
scales  (ε3)  however  all  of  the  analytical 
uncertainty practically vanished compared 
to  (16),  and  equality  C  III  =  C  I  holds.  
Hence,  according  to  the  model,  physical 
properties at the Einsteinean scales do not 
differ from those at the Newtonian scales.

knowledge  (measurement)  of  the  grave 
mode of oscillation of all the total-masses 
which comprise the gravitational fields of 
both the object of interest and the with it 
oscillating  (about  it  orbiting)  objects.  In 
this  way  it  would  be  possible  to  examine 
with a certainty whether gravitational and 
electromagnetic  fields  could  be  equated 
using the mechanical-electrical resonance

and hence applied onto the real Earth and

magnification of gravitation would need to 
be  properly  accounted

the elusive concepts of “dark energy” and 
“dark matter”, as it would account for the 
totality  of  the  entire  Hyperverse  and  not 
only of its radio-observable part known as

which  for  the  Earth-Moon  system,  (18) 
and (7), is well satisfied to within the NIST 
standard  uncertainty  for  G.    The  Planck 
constant  h  is  determined  analogously  to 
the  principle  of  SG  [63].    Thus,  besides  G 
Newton, h too reflects the effect of the Earth 
total-mass (mostly the mantle) resonance, 
C, as  given by Eq. (19).  Hence the power 
of  two  in  C-2,  Eq.  (26),  corroborates  the 
proposed  model.    Note  that,  according  to 
general  understanding,  the  theory  of 
quantum  gravity  allows  for  constants 
other than c, G, and h, such as C. 

If  C  is  constant  then  it  is  the  only 
constant,  in  which  case  its  value  (19)  is 
approximate. Then not only the Earth but 
also every spatially unique segment of the 
totality (Hyperverse) would maintain this 
constant,  as  well.  The  ratio  of  that 
segment's (say, the outer Universe's) grave 
mode  of  oscillation,  and  the  orbiting 
period  of  another  segment  (outer  outer 
Universe)  from  the  Hyperverse  orbiting 
about  the  outer  Universe,  would  be  a 
constant  approximately  equal  to  C  found 
in (19) for the Earth.  In case of the Earth, 
it is the Moon that largely masks the tidal 
influences of the rest of the Universe onto 
the Earth. In case of our Universe, it is to 
it neighboring (about it orbiting) Universe 
that  largely  masks  the  tidal  influences  of 
the  rest  of  the  Hyperverse  onto  our 
Universe... 

The  above-proposed  space  mission 
to verify (20) would show whether C and c 
in (26) are both universal constants, or, on 
the  contrary,  G  (and  hence  physics) 
changes  with  location.  In  either  case  the 
(discrete or continuous) generalised form 
of (26) gives

Finally,  the  most  general  form  of  (26) 
reads:

where the 0-th power of C means harmony 
of  all  oscillation.    Non-fractional  C  are 
obviously forbidden in local real domains. 
Therefore,  further  generalisations  of  (26) 
are not possible for scales larger than that

Within 

above-asserted 
(Hyperverse)  extension  of  the  proposed 
global  oscillator  model  onto  everything 
reality 
everywhere, 
be 
represented  by  a 
lattice  of  strings 
(hyperverses to us) in an even larger-scale 
Oberverse.  By  extension, there is nothing 
in  the  proposed  model  that  would  forbid 
the  lattice  of  to-us  strings  from  being  a 
hyperverse of even smaller-scales’ worlds, 
and  so  on.  The  logic  of  infinity  seems 
inconceivable  to  us  as  the  infinity  could 
correspond  not  to  our (linear)  perception 
of the frequency domain but to that entire 
domain itself, instead. 
Three 
linear  dimensions  bind  our 
consciousness.  As  a  result,  we  are 
incapable  of  relating  ourselves  to  the 
reality  in  terms  of  frequency  space which 
then  is  forever  non-obvious  (hidden)  to 
our  senses, but not to our instruments or 
analysis  methodologies 
as 
spectrography.  Thus, gravity is not a force 
as  Newton  linearly  misinterpreted  the 
frequency-space  reality;  nor  is  gravity 
linearly 
geometry 
misinterpreted 
reality  – 
arguably,  less  inaccurately  than  Newton 
did. Instead, gravity is omnipresent, and it 
does not “act on distance” by some illusive 
“gravity  waves”.    Rather,  gravitation  is

Supporting information 
 
In  order  to  verify  the  grave  mode  of  the 
Earth’s  total-mass  oscillation,  I  take  the 
SG  gravity 
three 
greatest  earthquakes  from  the  1990-ies 
that affected the Cantley SG record, Table 
A.    Using  the  to  GVSA  unique  ability  to 
process  gapped  records,  I  look  for  the 
differences between spectra of the selected 
gravity  recordings  without  gaps  and  with 
gaps  artificially 
those 
records.    I  thus  make  5,  then  21,  and  53 
filter-step-long  (8-32  sec)  gaps  in  the 
three records respectively, where the order 
of earthquakes was selected at random. By 
observing  the  differences  between  the 
Gauss-Vaníček  (G-V)  spectra  of  complete 
vs. incomplete records, I look for the first 
instance  when  this  difference  reaches  the 
zero  value.  Since  both  complete  and 
incomplete  records  always  described  the 
same  instance  and  same  location  when 
and where the same field (in this case the 
Earth  gravity  field)  was  sampled  during 
the  three  energy  emissions,  it is  precisely 
this value that marks the beginning of the 
Earth’s  natural  band of oscillation. If this 
setup is correct, then the more gaps in the 
record should mean the more pronounced 
impact  of  the  non-natural  information 

onto  the  spectra.  Indeed,  Figure  A  shows 
in  clearer 
that  more  gaps 
distinction  between  the  natural  and  non-
natural band. 

results 

The  effect  of  any  known  (including 
tidal)  variation  can  be  suppressed  in  the 
GVSA  together  with  processing,  within 
enforcing, see [17], where known periods in 
form  of  analytical  functions  or  discrete 
data  sets  can  be  forced  on  data.    Thus, 
when  GVSA  is  used,  no  preprocessing  is 
required  for  the  purpose  of  stripping  the 
observations

semidiurnal and diurnal tidal periods were

Thus  the  grave  mode  (most  natural

is measured as To’ = 3445 s ±0.35%, where 
uncertainty  is  based  on  1000  pt  spectral

critical of that estimate, mulishly insisting 
on “noise” removal.

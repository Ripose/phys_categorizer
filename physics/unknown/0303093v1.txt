Abstract

The exact Green function for the scalar wave equation in a plane with any set
of perfectly reflecting straight mirrors, which may be joined to form corners, is given
as a diffraction scattering series.  Instances would be slit diffraction in optics, or the
Schrodinger equation inside (or outside) a general polygonal enclosure (‘quantum
polygon billiards’). The method is based on the seminal 1896 Riemann helicoid
surface solution by Sommerfeld for optical diffraction by a single corner.  It is
generalised to account for multiple scatter by adapting the analysis of Stovicek for a
closely related problem: a collection of magnetic flux lines (points) in a plane, the
multi-flux Aharonov-Bohm effect.  The short wavelength limit is shown to yield the
‘geometrical theory of diffraction’. For slit diffraction the exact series is shown to
coincide with that of Schwarzschild in 1902.

Introduction

In two dimensions, as in three, it is not usually possible to write the Green
function for the scalar wave equation (cid:1)2(cid:1) (cid:2) k2(cid:1) (cid:3) 0 in the presence of reflecting
obstacles (with boundary conditions zero, (cid:1)=0, ‘Dirichlet’ case, or zero normal
derivative ‘Neumann’ case) except as the solution of a boundary integral equation.
The iterative solution of this could be considered a scattering series solution and was
pioneered by Balian and Bloch [1] (with application to the spectra of quantum
‘billiard’ enclosures).  However if the reflectors are straight line mirrors, then
following Thomas Young two hundred years ago, it is tempting to consider the
diffraction as arising just from the ends or corners (an end is a 2(cid:2) corner) of the
mirrors.  Although various approximations to this scheme have been successfully
pursued, it seems worthwhile to present here the exact scattering series theory
underlying the scheme despite its limited practicality.

Wave reflection from straight mirrors invites the introduction of an image

waves.  A point source of waves in the presence of an infinite straight mirror without
ends induces an image source and together they supply the exact wave field.
Similarly a point source in the presence of an ideal corner (two half infinite mirrors
forming a V shape), admits an exact wave solution obtained in the seminal 1896 paper
by Sommerfeld [2][3].  The solution can again be interpreted in terms of images of the
source (themselves imaged, generally, carrying on round the corner point forever).
With more corners, or mirrors with ends, the challenge is to combine these two parts,
mirror images and corner images, or corner diffraction as it would more usually be
called.  The approximate combination of these has a substantial history.

As a short wave limit one may, in the crudest approximation, ignore corner

diffraction effects altogether and use geometrical optics.  The light rays either go
directly from source to observation point or are reflected specularly (symmetrically)

off mirror faces on the way.  Endowed with phase (viewed, for example, as the
stationary phase evaluation of a Feynman path integral) the rays combine to exhibit
optical interference.  As an improvement to this approximation one can include corner
diffraction, treating it as a separate, additive effect.  Most simply this corner
diffraction too can be treated using the stationary phase approximation of the
Sommerfeld corner solution integral.  This is the strategy in the ‘Geometrical theory
of diffraction’ of Keller [4]. Alternatively, the superior uniform approximation dating
back to Pauli can be used [5].  Indeed this is necessary for finding the wave field near
the ‘shadow boundary’ of the geometrically illuminated region where the stationary
phase solution diverges falsely.  To cope with a sequence of such tricky marginal
scatters the Fresnel diffraction approach of Bogomolny et al [6] would be appropriate.

The exact scattering series will be quite simple to state (in the section on

multiple scatter below).  It derives from the Sommerfeld solution for optical
diffraction by a single corner which is reviewed in the next section. This is
generalised to account for multiple scatter by adapting the analysis of Stovicek [7],[8]
for a closely related problem: a collection of magnetic flux lines (points) in a plane,
the multi-flux Aharonov-Bohm effect (appendix D).  Corners with internal angle
dividing (cid:2) exactly (e.g. a right angle) are analogous to integer flux lines and give zero
scatter.  Only genuinely ‘diffracting corners’ with angles not dividing (cid:2) exactly need
feature in the scattering series.  As a partial check on the scattering series it is
compared with the 1902 exact scattering series of Schwarzschild [9] for slit
diffraction, and shown, with some effort, to agree term by term (appendix C).
Another check is its agreement with the geometrical theory of diffraction in the short
wavelength limit (appendix B).  Adaptation of the present scattering series to the
spectra of ‘billiard’ enclosures, where a series directly for the trace of the Green
function is required, is in progress [10].

Single scatter

The famous Sommerfeld solution of 1896 [2],[3] provides the exact Green
function for a half infinite straight mirror in two dimensions (fig 1).  Since there is
only one diffracting ‘corner’ involved (the mirror end point) this is single scatter.
From single scatter, in the next section, the multiple scatter for more than one
diffracting corner is to be built up.  Sommerfeld solves the half infinite mirror
problem by what amounts to a method of images trick applied to a simpler system.
The simpler system has no mirror at all, and hence no boundary condition (except the
usual outgoing one at infinity).  He finds the Green function, instead, for a ‘Riemann
helicoid surface’ - a flattened helicoid comprising an infinite stack of plane layers
each joined to its two neighbours in the manner of a screw or spiral staircase (fig 2).
To describe his method it is simplest to start, as he does, with a source point at infinite
distance producing, therefore, a plane wave on a single layer incident on the vertex
(the centre of the helicoid).  The question then is how the wave diffracts and winds
around the vertex onto all the other layers.  (Actually Sommerfeld starts with just two
layers, applicable for the single half mirror, but needs more later for the wedge corner
formed by two.  To make the image method more explicit and general, we prefer here
to introduce a full helicoid straightaway.)

To find out he merely writes down the original plane wave as an infinitesimal

Fig 3.   Circle

The cleverness is that the fully inflated contour shape has infinitely many

similar up and down U shaped segments centred at higher and higher angles (period
2(cid:2)).  Consider just a particular pair of U shaped segments, one up, one down, namely
those closest to the origin. The integral over this pair of contours alone, with the rest

discarded, has a natural interpretation: it describes the wave field on a single layer of
the helicoid surface.  If (cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:2)(cid:4)it gives the wave field on the geometrically
illuminated layer, but if (cid:3) is considered free to range everywhere, -(cid:3)<(cid:3)<(cid:3), the field
on other layers is described.  To justify this is one checks firstly that the integral obeys
the wave equation.  This is shown by a shift of the origin of (cid:3)’ to (cid:3) so that the
integrand as a function of r,(cid:3) then obviously obeys the wave equation.  This suffices:
the shift makes the contour (cid:3) dependent, and therefore subject to the differentiations
in the wave equation, but by analyticity the integral is contour independent, its ends
lying in ‘valleys’ at infinity.  Also the integral has the correct singularity on the
geometrically illuminated layer (see below) and is outgoing at infinite radius (having
subtracted the incident wave on the illuminated layer(cid:4). Added together the wave fields
on all the layers reconstruct the original plane wave as they must.

The wave field on the helicoid is supplied, then, by a U shaped contour integral, that
symmetric about (cid:3)’=-(cid:2)/2 together with its inverted U partner symmetric about
(cid:3)’=+(cid:2)/2.  These can be shifted sideways somewhat, and rendered rectangular (fig 4)
so that the horizontal segments cancel and all that remains is two straight vertical
lines.  Only if the observation point lies in the geometrically illuminated layer (-
(cid:2)<(cid:3)<(cid:2)) is there an exception, namely that the horizontal segments do not fully cancel
because they go opposite sides of the pole.  They yield, instead, the undisturbed plane
wave.

contour and partner (rendered rectangular).  The observation point is here shown
sited not on the geometrically illuminated layer but on the first shadowed layer of the
helicoid.

Where the imaginary part of the angle involved in the integration along the vertical
lines has been denoted by s.   Although the first term, corresponding to geometrical
illumination, has a line of discontinuity along the ‘shadow boundaries’ (cid:3)=(cid:2) and (cid:3)=-(cid:2)(cid:5)(cid:4)
the second term, the diffraction integral, has a cancelling discontinuity along these
lines ensuring that the total wave field is continuous.  The cancellation can be checked

by noting the residue -iexp(ikr) at the pole at (cid:3)=(cid:2) or iexp(ikr) at (cid:3)=-(cid:2)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:4)This residue
(times 2(cid:2)i/2(cid:2)) supplies the discontinuity in the value of the integral across the lines. 

To generate the wave field in the presence of the half infinite mirror it is

merely necessary to place image sources on the helicoid. The angles at which they
should be placed are found from an angular version of the method of images of an
object between two mirrors in one dimension (fig 5).  The separation of the two
mirrors is 2(cid:2) (along the angle axis) with physical space lying between them and
containing the true point source.  Both the source and the mirrors are imaged out to
infinity (in angle).

Fig 5.  The angles of plane wave sources. The middle white source is the true one and
the others are images.  The mirrors on either side of the true source represent the two
faces of the true half infinite mirror.  For Dirichlet boundary conditions alternate
image sources are negative (shown black), while for Neumann ones all are positive.

The summation over all the white sources of fig 5 (separation 4(cid:2)) is straightforward
using the identity (cid:5)(n+x)-1=(cid:2)cot((cid:2)x), over -(cid:3)<n<(cid:3).  Likewise for the black sources.
The summation can be made explicit at any desired stage, but we proceed, for
simplicity with the unsummed helicoid, remarking only that for the plane wave source
under consideration the result of the summation can be manipulated into the famous
exact Fresnel integral form.

Sommerfeld proceeded to find the wave field from a source at finite distance

r0, that is, he found the Green function (fig 6) for the helicoid.  The procedure is
simply to replace the plane wave in the integral (1) by the free space Green function,
k 2(cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:2)(r(cid:4)r0 )
namely the Hankel function  1
in two dimensions, the constants being appropriate to quantum mechanics with
(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2) =m=1).  Measuring the angle (cid:3) from the direction of the source as before, the Green
function for the helicoid is

One notes that the Hankel function in the ‘geometrical illumination’ term contains the
real angle (cid:3), while that inside the diffraction integral contains the imaginary part of
the angle, s.  The angular diffraction or scattering factor in square brackets contains
the full complex angle (cid:3)+is

Once again the value of the diffraction integral has a line of discontinuity on
(cid:3)=(cid:2) and (cid:3)=-(cid:2) with the jump in value obtained from the residue at the corresponding
pole.  This cancels the discontinuity in the geometrical term so that the total wave
field on the helicoid is continuous.  Since the geometrical wave field is zero on the
shadow side, one can obtain the value of the wave field exactly on the shadow
boundary by taking the limit of the diffracted wave field from that side.  A similar
principle applies to the case of more than one scatter.
 

For the purpose of concatenation of scatters (linking them successively into a
chain) in the next section it is worth re-expressing this formula for the Green function
in terms of ‘time’.  For example the geometrical illumination term becomes

This integral representation of the Hankel function has the physical interpretation of
the Fourier transform of the standard time propagator in free space.  With (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2) (cid:1) m (cid:1) 1
this propagator is

and has the form (1/time) exp(i (cid:2) kinetic energy (cid:2) time).  In full, the new expression

The final step, following Stovicek [7], is to make more explicit the separation
into before scatter (subscript 0) and after scatter (subscript 1).  First, trivially, r will be
renamed r1.  Then new integration variables t0 and t1 will be introduced by making the

transformation s,t(cid:3) t0,t1 is (t/ t0t1).  Natural interpretations for t0 and t1 are the ‘time’
durations before and after scatter and this is suggestive for the later step of
concatenating scatters so we adopt this ‘time’ nomenclature henceforth.  Actually it is
worth retaining the t integral unevaluated, easy though it is, for later comparison.  The
Green function for the helicoid thus becomes

This new expression has the merit of having decomposed the diffraction
integrand into a form: free propagation, then scatter, then free propagation again.
(Performing the t integral would make that completely explicit).  If the scatter term
looks ugly, one may note that the complex angle (cid:3)+is has nevertheless a certain
elegance.  Temporarily thinking of the two dimensional space of propagation as a
complex plane with the source as drawn on the real axis, (cid:3)+is is the change of the
logarithm of the complex velocity at the scatter. If one denotes initial velocity by the
real number r0/t0, and final velocity by (r1/t1)expi(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) then
(cid:3)+is=ln((r1/t1)expi(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:5)ln(r0/t0).

By virtue of the decomposition just mentioned the form (8) allows
concatenation as we learn from Stovicek [7], [8]; we can generalise to a chain of
scatters in the next section. Before doing so, it is useful, finally to revert to
Sommerfeld and present the summed formula, the Green function for the half infinite
mirror or indeed a reflecting wedge of any positive open angle (cid:7) (the half screen being
a wedge of open angle of 2(cid:2)).  This, likewise, will be concatenable; as indicated
before, summation and concatenation are independent procedures. The results will
then describe the Green function for any arrangement of straight mirrors perhaps
joined to form corners or polygons.  

Fig 7.  Defining the angles for corner scatter 
The arrangement of image source angles for a corner of open angle (cid:7)  is just as

in fig 5 above except that the gap between the mirrors is now (cid:7)  rather than 2(cid:2).  It is
useful to adopt a system of measuring angles which will allow generalisation.  At
every corner between two mirrors we shall measure angles anti-clockwise from the
clockwise extreme of the corner opening (fig 7).  The two joining straight mirrors thus

have angles zero and (cid:7).  The incoming direction, or rather its reverse, will be denoted
by the angle (cid:8), and the outgoing direction to the field point by (cid:8)’.  Thus both angles lie
between zero and (cid:7).  Pictorially one can represent an individual image term in this
summation in a purely schematic way as a ‘rattling’ or swinging and bouncing (like
the clapper of a bell) between the two mirrors (fig 8).  We shall use the word ‘rattle’
to describe this angular reflection process.  In keeping with the description
‘diffraction’, rattle reflections lead to an outgoing direction from a corner which is not
determined by the incoming one, in contrast to ordinary specular reflections on a
mirror face.  

Fig 8.  The rattles with reflection number M=0, -1, +2, -3

Fig 9.  Unfolded version of M=-1 rattle 

The various scattering angles from the rattlings are the total angles of swing (signed
according to whether their initial swing direction is anticlockwise or clockwise).  Thus
with the number of reflections |M|  (and -(cid:8)(cid:9)M(cid:9)(cid:8)), the ‘unfolded’ scattering angles
are (cid:3)=(cid:8)’-(cid:8)+M(cid:7), for M even or (cid:3)=-(cid:8)’-(cid:8)+(M+1)(cid:7), for M odd (fig 9).  With Dirichlet
boundary conditions the even M  sum corresponds to the sum over positive images
and the odd M sum to the sum over negative images (for Neumann all are positive).

The Sommerfeld Green function for the wedge is then the sum of direct free
space Green functions from (possibly multiple) specular reflections on mirrors plus
the single scatter diffracted ray Green function, namely

The first f in (9) describes the sum over even M images, the second that over odd M
ones, and the negative sign between them is appropriate for Dirichlet boundary
conditions (for Neumann it would be positive).  The sign between the cot functions in
(10) is always negative, as in (4).  One may note, as mentioned in the introduction,
that if (cid:7) divides (cid:2) then f=0 by the (cid:2) periodicity of the function cot and there is no
corner diffraction.

The diffracted wave field (9) is continuous except on two ‘shadow boundaries’

across which it has a discontinuity.  This exactly cancels the accompanying
discontinuity in the geometrical illumination field, so that the total wave field has no
discontinuity. The discontinuity arises mathematically because, in moving the field
point across the shadow boundary, a pole in f crosses the (real s) axis of integration at
the origin.  This association (of geometrical shadow and diffraction pole at the origin)
comes about as follows.  

Consider an ordinary ray (not corner diffracted) from the source which runs

along side (indefinitely close to) the ray coming directly in to the corner.  Each of the
two possibilities for which side it runs is to give rise to a shadow boundary.   The
ordinary ray (choosing one possibility) will just miss the corner and instead reflect
specularly off the two mirrors alternately some number of times (0,1,2…) close to the
corner before emerging from the corner region (radially in the limit).  It constitutes, by
definition, a shadow boundary.  We can now argue that if the outgoing diffracted ray
(at angle (cid:8)’) coincides with this shadow boundary there is a pole in an f.  Among all
the different rattle paths there will be one whose reflection sequence matches that of
the ordinary ray.  When unfolded, the ordinary ray is rendered straight.  If the
matching rattle path were likewise unfolded, it too would emerge in a straight ahead
direction. It has an unfolded scattering angle (cid:3) (as defined above) equal to ±(cid:2), and
therefore its angular scatter factor (4) has a pole at the origin in s, which is inherited
by the sum (10) over rattles, f. 

Multiple scatter

The Green function is a sum of contributions from all possible geometrical

(undiffracted) rays, and from all possible diffracted rays joining the source point to the
observation point via a sequence of corners.  A diffracted ray with n corner scatters
(i.e. diffractions) has n+1 ‘legs’.  Any leg may involve one or more specular
reflections off mirror faces (it is still all one leg). Successive corners must be visible
from each other (possibly via specular reflections). Successive corners which lie on
the same mirror (at opposite ends of it) are considered as mutually visible, with the
ray travelling alongside the mirror surface – a ‘surface leg’ (which, however will be
shown to count half).  ‘Accidental’ contact of a ray with a corner is not allowed. That
is, if during its journey, a ray leg happens to reflect specularly off a mirror at zero
distance from a corner, this corner must be counted as a corner in the scattering
sequence; the ray leg must be split into two consecutive legs.  The scatter at this
corner is necessarily of the shadow boundary type just discussed for single scatter.
Although non-generic (because it arose only in special accidental circumstances) it is
particularly important when the Green function is traced [6][10].  We return to this
shadow boundary case in appendix A.

corner scatters, and therefore four legs in all.  The first leg involves a specular
reflection and the second is a ‘surface’ leg.

Fig 10.  A diffractive ray with three

The form of the Green function is a concatenation of scatters (fig 10): leg,

scatter, leg, scatter, …leg, scatter, leg.  However these stages are linked to each other
(in contrast with approximate treatments): they are part of a multiple integral, one
integration for each scatter.  The justification of the formula lies in the discovery of
Stovicek [7] [8] that the exact Green function on the multi-helicoid ‘covering surface’
is a concatenation of scatters (appendix D).  He used this for the multiple flux line
Aharonov-Bohm effect.  Our use of it, for our system of mirrors rather than flux lines,
is simpler in that there are no magnetic flux phase factors, but more complicated in
that some book keeping is necessary to account correctly for images and parity
changes.  Surface rays, particularly, require careful accounting.  

The basic principle for forming the Green function is easy to state (though

infinitely uneconomical in the number of terms prior to simplification): every distinct
diffracted ray (with every different number of internal rattles at corners) needs
counting once.  Its contribution is found by first unfolding the ray path fully and
assigning positive durations to the legs.  Then form the chain iK0(cid:2)[ ](cid:2)iK0(cid:2)[ ](cid:2) …..(cid:2)[
](cid:2)iK0 where the K0 factors (6) have their different leg lengths and durations, and [ ]
stands for the different primitive corner diffraction factors (4) with s=ln(speed
after/speed before).  Finally integrate this product over all leg durations (with the
k2(cid:2) total duration]).  For Dirichlet boundary
Fourier transform factor (-i) exp[i 1
2
conditions an additional factor –1 is needed for every reflection (rattle or specular).
Both the scatter term product and the leg term product and can be simplified
separately, first the former and then the latter (starting with the paragraph of eqn 13).  

One can fix attention on a particular diffracted ray path (sequence of legs

between scatter corners) and evaluate the rattle summation at each corner.  As before
(9), for a given corner, there are separate results f for even and odd numbers of rattle
reflections there.  However with more than one scatter there is a subtlety and it is not
correct merely to take the difference (or sum) of even and odd parts for each corner
and form their product.  Instead, as explained below, the total scattering factor will be
expressed in terms of a product of (2(cid:2)2) matrices.

The subtlety mentioned concerns parity.  The unfolding process for a ray

reverses the parity of space at each unfold (i.e. reflection, whether it is a rattle
reflection or a specular one).  Thus the positive angles (cid:8)’ and (cid:8), can, on the unfolded
ray, acquire negative sense. This means that for more than one scatter there are four,
rather than two, possible arguments for f.  For even rattle number one has f(±((cid:8)’-(cid:8)))
and for odd f(±(-(cid:8)’-(cid:8))), where the parity ±  is determined by whether the total number

of reflections of any kind prior to the corner in question is even or odd.  For the jth
scatter corner denote by fj((cid:11)) the form (10) with its non-explicit arguments, namely the
quantities s and (cid:7), each having subscript j.  The four possibilities are usefully
assembled into a (2(cid:2)2) corner scatter matrix for the jth scatter corner,

It will be shown that the correct total scattering factor is given in terms of the
(cid:1) (cid:2) for a leg
(cid:1) (cid:2) for an odd number
(cid:2).  For example the resulting matrix
(cid:1) (cid:2).  With this understanding for the

For Neumann boundary conditions the vector (1, -1) is replaced by (1, 1).

(cid:1)(cid:2)
The justification of this matrix representation is as follows.  The vector  1
input on the right hand side of the product signifies the initial, real space, parity.  If
there is no specular reflection before the first corner scatter (or if there is an even
(cid:1) (cid:2)and parity is retained on entering the
number of them) the initial leg matrix is  1 0
(cid:1) (cid:2) to  0

F1 yields a vector with components corresponding to the true and reversed parity
conditions exiting the corner, namely (for even prior specular reflections) (f1((cid:8)1’-(cid:8)1),
f1(-(cid:8)1’-(cid:8)1)).  For odd prior specular reflections instead, (f1(-(cid:8)1’+(cid:8)1), f1((cid:8)1’+(cid:8)1)) would
be produced.  The parity condition information is thus retained through the matrix
product and the true and reversed parity results are finally combined with a sign
difference for Dirichlet boundary conditions or without for Neumann.

Surface ray legs require further discussion to justify their associated matrix
(cid:2).    This is half times the matrix for zero (or even) specular reflections, and
(cid:1)
both the ‘half’ and the ‘zero’ need explanation.  Taking zero for granted, temporarily,
the need for the factor half becomes clear as follows by examining the rattles at either
end of the mirror (fig 11).

Fig 11. Possibilities for surface leg rattles.  Only two, not four should be counted.
For simplicity the case shown has no additional rattle reflections on the side mirrors.

There can be a rattle reflection at neither end or at both ends, or at one and not

the other (two choices), and these are related in a rather special way.  Unfolding
would normally distinguish paths with different rattlings, but of these four
possibilities, even when unfolded, the first two are essentially identical paths.  They
have identical contributions to the scattering sum and ought not be counted as distinct.
The same applies to the latter pair.  Such duplicates should be counted just once, not
twice, and the easiest prescription is to count them all and divide by two.  Returning
to the question of ‘zero’ specular reflections assumed above, actually this assumption
(cid:2) associated with a
(cid:1)
is not required.  The matrix  1/ 2
specular reflection on the surface.  There is no change in the result because, as a
surface ray, the leg either has zero exit angle from the first corner, or zero entry angle
to the second.  (In fig 11 the latter holds by the anticlockwise definition of angles, but
flipping the pictures upside down would give the former).  This means, in the former
case, that the first corner matrix F has its two rows identical and therefore
(cid:1)
(cid:2)F= 0
(cid:1)
(cid:2)F, or in the latter case the second corner F has its two columns
1/ 2
(cid:2), demonstrating the equivalence.  Using either
(cid:1)
identical so that F 1/ 2

(cid:1)
(cid:2)=F 0
matrix ensures that all truly distinct paths are counted once.

The Green function for the system is then given by a sum over any number of

scatters n from one to infinity.  An n=0 term is included for neatness, referring to
geometrical illumination (possibly via specular reflections) with no integrations and
no scatters, just a single free propagator K0 (6) for each geometrical ray.  Denoting the

having no integrations and no scattering factor matrices F.  It is a summation over all
‘direct’ ray paths from r to r’ (with possible specular reflections) in which R is taken
equal to r0, the total length of the ray path in question.

Appendix A.  Shadow boundaries

For the observation point lying on a shadow boundary of a ray that has had

multiple scatters there are cancelling discontinuities.  The cancellation (appendix D) is
similar to that described for single scatter.  One discontinuity arises from a pole in the
diffraction integral at the scatter casting the shadow (the final one), and the other from
the scatter immediately before, with the final one omitted (analogous to the
geometrical, source wave field in single scatter).

The ‘accidental’ circumstance of a shadow boundary arising in the course of a

scatter path rather than at the end, i.e. one scattering corner lying exactly on the
shadow boundary of another, is dealt with similarly.  The circumstance shows up
mathematically as a pole at the origin in the s integral associated with the scatter

casting the shadow. The prescription for which side of the pole the integration contour
should pass emerges as follows from an investigation of the geometry responsible for
the singularity.  One particular rattle ray at the corner casting the shadow unfolds to
emerge straight ahead after bypassing the corner, making one of its two terms (4)
singular at s=0.  The ±(cid:1) sense of the bypass determines the prescription for the
integration contour: the contour should bypass the pole in the complex s plane in the
sense opposite to that with which the physical unfolded rattle ray bypasses the corner.
To justify this one first notes that hypothetical infinitesimal transverse shifts in
physical and complex planes match in sign: a rightward transverse shift in the corner
position, looking along the ray, causes a positive increment in scattering angle which
shifts the pole in (4) downwards (i.e. rightwards looking along the path) in the
complex plane.  Now consider a shift of the corner position in a direction away from
its bypass semicircle.  This corresponds to allowing geometrical visibility passed the
corner.  For the integration contour, allowing geometrical visibility means acquiring a
pole residue by pushing the pole towards the bypass loop of the contour.  The two
bypasses must therefore be in opposite senses.

Fig 12.  Left: An unfolded shadow boundary rattle ray bypassing its corner point with
an angle –(cid:1).  Right: the corresponding integration contour for the s integral for that
corner bypasses its pole with the opposite sense; +(cid:1). 

In the even more special case that there are several such accidental shadow

boundary scatters in succession the prescription is the natural generalization.  There is
a single singular rattle ray which unfolds to be straight ahead after bypassing each
relevant corner (the ones casting shadows on the next).  The sense ±(cid:1) of each bypass
needs to be reproduced, oppositely, in the complex plane contour of its own s integral.

Appendix B.  Geometrical theory of diffraction

The stationary phase evaluation of the Green function will now be shown (in
outline) to lead to the so called ‘Geometrical theory of diffraction’ [4], [12].  This is
the short wavelength or semiclassical limit of diffraction theory with different
versions appropriate to many different circumstances (e.g. curved mirrors, refracting
interfaces etc.).  For our circumstance of straight mirrors in two dimensions the most
obvious limitations of the geometrical theory (and correspondingly the stationary
phase approximation of our Green function) show up close to any shadow boundary,
being falsely singular there.  Also, for diffracted ray paths with surface ray legs the
geometrical theory gives (correctly) zero contribution (for Dirichlet boundary

conditions) at the usual order in k, as does stationary phase.  The evaluation at the
next order in k is discussed at the end below.

To obtain the short wavelength limit the Hankel function in (21) is replaced by

its asymptotic form (which is equivalent to evaluating the time integral in (5) by
stationary phase)  H0
s1=s2=……=sn=0 and expanding the cosh functions with L(cid:1)r0+r1…+rn,

(1) (kR) (cid:1) 2 / i(cid:1)kR exp(ikR).  The exponent ikR is stationary when

(22)

There is simplification of the corner scatter product too.  Since the functions f

in the scattering matrix product are non-singular (excluding the shadow boundaries
mentioned) all the sj in them can be set to zero for the stationary phase evaluation.
(This is not true, however, for surface rays in the Dirichlet case which is dealt with
later).  The functions f (10) are now symmetric functions of their argument (f((cid:11))=f(-(cid:11)))
and therefore each matrix F (11) has its two diagonal terms equal and its two off-
diagonal terms equal.  That is, Fj decomposes into aj

With the initial and final vectors, (1,0) and (1,-1) for Dirichlet boundary conditions
inserted, the whole the scattering factor becomes the product of pairs [fj((cid:2)j’-(cid:2)j)-fj(-(cid:2)j’-
(cid:2)j)] as in (9), with an additional factor –1 for each specular reflection. (For Neumann
boundary conditions the insertion of (1,1) as the final vector means the two functions f
in each pair are added instead of subtracted and the factor –1 is absent).  

Returning to (22), having argued that the corner scattering product acts a

constant as far as the integrations are concerned, one is left with a multiple Gaussian
integral.  Changing the variables of integration to s’1=s1, s’2=s1+s2, ….,
s’n=s1+s2…..+sn, and defining s’0=0 for notational convenience, we have

(More systematically to obtain (25) one can eliminate the off-diagonal determinant
elements of (24) by capturing them in a perfect square and introduce an auxiliary

integration to represent it:  exp[iku((cid:1)rm

2(cid:1)i exp[(cid:1)ik((cid:2)rm

(cid:3)(cid:4)s m)2 / 2L], and then reverse the order of integration).  Thus, in

summary, stationary phase evaluation of the Green function yields the zero s value of
the integrand of (21) times the integral (25).  This result reproduces the ‘Geometrical
theory of diffraction’.

The special case of surface ray legs can also be investigated in the geometrical
limit.  For Neumann boundary conditions surface rays are no different from ordinary
ray legs (apart form the surface factor one half).  For Dirichlet ones however, a surface
ray contributes at a lower order in k than a non-surface one.  This arises because the
special angles involved (zero or (cid:3) for the angles at the ends of the leg).  Using the
symmetry of f at s=0 (f((cid:11))=f(-(cid:11))) and also the periodicity of f with period 2(cid:3) it follows
that the corner scatter matrices Fj and Fj+1 at each end of a surface ray leg have all four
of their elements equal.  In particular [fj((cid:2)j’-(cid:2)j)-fj(-(cid:2)j’-(cid:2)j)]=0 (and similarly with
subscripts j+1) rendering the product of pair terms over all j zero.

ÝF j

 and Fj+1(cid:13)constant+sj+1

To obtain a non-zero result, the values of sj and sj+1 must not be set to zero.
For simplicity we shall assume that this is the only surface leg so that all the other s
values can be set to zero. Instead the fj and fj+1 must be Taylor expanded to first order,
f(cid:13)constant+s Ýf  where the over-dot indicates differentiation with respect to s, and their
ÝF j+1.  The constant part of
matrices formed: Fj(cid:13)constant+sj
each matrix (with all its four elements equal) can be discarded since its product with
the  other  leads  to  zero  contribution  as  stated,  and  also  terms  linear  in  s  vanish  on
integration.    Due  to  the  antisymmetry  ( Ýf ((cid:11))=- Ýf (-(cid:11)))  of  the  s  derivative  at  s=0,
together  with  the  periodicity  of  f,  period  2(cid:3),  the  matrix  ÝF j  has  the  form
(cid:2).    The  scattering  matrix
Ýf j((cid:2)j’-(cid:2)j) 1 (cid:1)1
1 (cid:1)1
product has now been fully specified and can be simplified using (23) for the leg chain
prior  to  j  and  for  that  after  j+1.    There  remains  the  modified  Gaussian  integral
(cid:12)sjsj+1exp[ik(R-L)]ds1…dsn=(cid:4)/ikrj  where  (cid:4)  stands  for  (25)  (evaluated  using  the  fact
that the j,j+1 element of the inverse of the matrix associated with the quadratic form
in (22) is –1/rj).  In summary for a diffracted ray with a surface leg the Green function
is the zero s value of the integrand of (21) with Fj and Fj+1 replaced by  ÝF j and  ÝF j+1,
multiplied by (cid:4)/ikrj.

Appendix C.  Slit diffraction

Slit diffraction in optics was first solved exactly by a scattering series due to
Schwarzschild (of relativity fame) in 1902 [9],[11],[13]. Furthermore Schwarzschild
proved that his scattering series was convergent (albeit slowly for long wavelength).
(Complementing this in 1908, slit diffraction was solved exactly in elliptical
coordinates by Sieger [14] as an infinite series of Mathieu functions which converges
best for long wavelengths). It is of interest, then, to apply the present scattering series
to the example of a single infinite straight line with a gap of width a (the slit) in it.
Each end of the gap is a 2(cid:1) diffracting corner.  The result will be that present series
and the Schwarzschild series are identical term by term.  The proven convergence in

this special case gives some encouragement that the present series is convergent in
general.

The geometry for the Schwarzschild solution is a plane wave (corresponding

to a point source at infinite distance r(cid:1)) incident perpendicularly on the slit The
boundary conditions on the screen are Dirichlet or Neumann ones but we restrict
attention to Dirichlet. It suffices to verify that the wave field from corresponding
scattering terms in the two series are identical on the line of the slit itself (at position
r) since the field elsewhere can be deduced from this.  Actually in the simple
geometry of this example the wave field in the slit is the same as that produced by
scattering in free space from two half unit magnetic flux lies (points) located at the
gap ends so that no adaptation of the Stovicek scattering series is needed. 

For the single scatter term only one end of the gap is relevant, the other half
line can be removed, reducing to the Sommerfeld half line problem.  The line end is
taken as the origin.  The two versions of the exact Sommerfeld solution are, then, on
the left the present (Stovicek) expression with the Hankel function written as its
asymptotic form for large argument (since r(cid:1) is infinite), and on the right the
Schwarzschild expression.  The angles which have been substituted in (9) are (cid:2)=(cid:1)/2
and (cid:2)’=(cid:1).

The equality is verified by using r(cid:1)=(cid:8) to simplify the first term to
exp(ikr(cid:1))exp[ikrcosh(s1)]/(cid:14)r(cid:1), splitting the (-(cid:8),(cid:8)) domain of integration on the left
into halves, and applying the change of coordinates cosh(s1)=1+(l1/r),.  In the
Schwarzschild expression on the right the scatter is pictured as happening not at the
end of the half line but at distance l1 along it, all such positions being integrated over
(fig 13).

For more than one scatter (the ones after the first having (cid:2)=(cid:1), (cid:2)’=(cid:1)) the corresponding

The required change of coordinates to verify this is rather involved.  First the
integration variables on the left can be taken as s1, s1+s2, …, s1+s2+…+sn.  Then the (-

(27)

(cid:8),(cid:8)) domain of integration on the left can be split into halves and converted to one
with s1>0, s1+s2>0, …, s1+s2+…+sn>0.  Define l’1(cid:1)r[cosh(s1+s2+..sn)-1] and then
l’2(cid:1)(a/2)[cosh(s1+s2+..sn-1)-1], l’3(cid:1)(a/2)[cosh(s1+s2+..sn-2)-1], …. l’n(cid:1)(a/2)[cosh(s1)-1].
Then for the n scatter term one has a form identical to the right side above except for
the first and last factors in the last denominator

This coordinate change converts the square root in the integral on the left directly to
the square root in the integral on the right.  The Jacobian of the transformation then
equals the ratio of the remaining sections of integrand on the two sides of the
equation.  Both these assertions can be proved with some effort by induction – if they
are true for the n-1 scatter then they are also true for the n scatter.  For example the
Jacobian for the former is that for the latter times (-1)n (ln+a)/(ln (cid:15)l2’/(cid:15)ln- 1
which is easy to evaluate.

Appendix D.  Stovicek theory

The justification for the concatenation formula (21) (or it predecessors) is most

easily expressed in the multi-helicoid surface (officially the ‘covering space’) in
which there is a Riemann helicoid at each scattering point.  The helicoids do not have
any unexpected connections - there is only one topology of path between any given
source point and observation point – no alternative ones.  All the different paths
between them are deformable into each other within the surface.  Two truths need to
be verified for the justification of (21); that the formula obeys the wave equation as a
function of observation position (except on shadow boundary lines), and that the
discontinuities produced along shadow boundary lines are cancelled by others from
separate terms. 

That the concatenated formula obeys the wave equation follows by recognising

that the quantities relating to the final leg to the observation point enter the formula

just as they did for single scatter – the Sommerfeld solution.  Therefore the wave
equation is automatically obeyed.

As for the discontinuities, the cancellation comes about because for every line

of discontinuity associated with n scatters there is a coincident line of discontinuity
associated with n+1 scatters.  An example is shown in fig 14.  The cancellation is
guaranteed by the same pole crossing argument as for the single scatter Sommerfeld
solution.

Fig 14.  Left: The four discontinuity lines associated with a particular double scatter
among four points.  Three go radially away from the last scatter, and one, based at
the last scatter goes radially away from the penultimate scatter.  Right: The four
discontinuity lines associated with a particular triple scatter among the same points.
They are generated as before, and one of them, the leftmost coincides with (and
cancels) the double scatter discontinuity.

At last North East Regional Conference of the American Association of Physics Teachers 
at Princeton University, at the fall meeting of the New England Section of the APS and AAPT at 
Milton  Academy  and  at  the  123rd  National  Meeting  of  the  American  Association  of  Physics 
Teachers  was  presented  a  simple  exited  experiment  of  magic  Hero's  fountain  [1].  This 
demonstration took and attracted attention of the audience and many questions were raised about 
it construction and action. We have been asked to white comments about that demonstration. All 
these motivated us to write this note. 

 

 

Hero  of  Alexandria  (his  name  is  also  spelled  Heron)  was  a  Greek  mathematician  and 
scientist.  He  is  best  known  today  for  an  important  theorem  in  plane  geometry,  also  known  as 
Heron's Formula (Hero’s Formula), for finding the area of a triangle in terms of its sides. Hero 
has  done  his  work  in  Alexandria,  Egypt,  and  has  written  at  least  13  works  on  mathematics, 
mechanics,  and  physics.  He  developed  various  mechanical  devices,  including  the  aelopile,  a 
rotary steam engine, and water jet produced by mechanically compressed air, -apparatus known 
as Hero's fountain. He dealt with a number of such engineering devices in his book Pneumatica 
[2]. Hero's fountain, a pneumatic apparatus in 
which  a  vertical  jet  of  water  is  produced  and 
sustained by air pressure, and air forces water 
above its source.  
Well known that the pressure of static 
 
fluid is the same at any horizontal level within 
connected vessels. This principle is underlying 
of  a  gravity-fed  fountain  shown  in  Fig.1. 
When  the  water  is  projected  vertically  from 
the pipe connected to open reservoir it reaches 
the  maximum  height  that  equal  to  an  altitude 
of the top of water level in the open reservoir.  
The  height  of  the  fountain  is  a  distance 
between 
the  nozzle  of  the  fountain  and 
horizontal  level  of  the  open  reservoir.  If  a 
fountain is not gravity-fed you need a pump to 
produce a difference of pressure to supply the 
fountain.

Today  you  can  find  a  numerous 
publications and on the Internet (for example Refs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), which are describing operation 
and  different  modified  constructions  of  Hero’s  fountain.    The  fountain  invented  by  the  ancient 
Greek mechanist doesn't have a vessel above a fountain nozzle or a pump and can be considered 
as  one  of  the  best  demonstrations  of  the  properties  of  liquids,  explicitly  of  Pascal’s  and 
Bernoulli’s  principles,  the  topic  that  always  discussed  in  introductory  college  and  university 
physics.  See,  for  example,  Refs.  8  and  9.  The  construction  of  our  Hero's  fountain  is  rather 
different than the ancient original one [2] or a traditional demonstration [10] though the principle 
of the action is the same.

The  principle  of  its  action  and  explanation  could  be  found  in  the  construction  of  this 
fountain. Figure 2 incorporates a scheme for the Hero's fountain. The fountain consists of three 
parts:  a  cup  A  with  fountain  tubes,  and  two 
vessels  B  and  C  with  partially  filled  by 
water.  The  parts  are  connected  with  two 
flexible  hoses  as  shown  in  Fig.2:  the  cup  A 
with lower vessel C and vessel C with upper 
vessel  B.  The  vessel  B  with  cup  can  be 
placed on a table and the other one below the 
level  of  the  table.  The  cup  A  is  maintained 
on the upper vessel B and connected with the 
lower  vessel  C  by  a  flexible  hose.  Initially 
the pressure in both vessels B and C equal to 
atmospheric  pressure.  When  you  fill  up  the 
cup  A  with  water  the  water  from  the  cup  A 
flows  down  to  the  lower  vessel  C,  which 
contains  air,  and  produces  the  additional 
P ρ=
hydrostatic  pressure
,  where  (cid:31)  is 
2
the density of water. According the Pascal’s 
principle 
is 
transmitted  undiminished  to  all  directions 
and  therefore  to  the  air  inside  of  the  vessel 
C. As a result this pressure forces a confined 
air  up  from  vessel  C  to  the  upper  vessel  B. 
The  forced  air  from  the  lower  vessel  C 
squeezes  the  air  in  the  upper  vessel  B,  and 
forces  the  water  spout  out  of  the  fountain 
upper  tube.  At  this  moment  the  hydrostatic 
pressure  in  the  upper  vessel  B  is  equal 
.  Thus,  the  pressure  of  the  water  in  the  fountain  is  the  difference  of  the  hydrostatic

In other words the pressure  P∆  compresses the air in the upper vessel B and drives the fountain. 
If  we  neglect  the  height  of  the  nozzle  of  the  fountain  above  the  water  level  in  the  cup  A, 
difference  of  heights 
  will  be  equal  to  the  altitude  of  the  top  of  the  water  level  in  the 
vessel A measured with respect to the water level in the vessel C. By changing this altitude we 
can maintain the fountain.

Hero's fountain is also good demonstration for the Bernoulli's Principle. The Bernoulli's 
Principle is a result of application of the work-energy theorem to a unit volume of a moving fluid. 
It simply states that the work done on a unit volume of fluid by the surrounding fluid is equal to 
the  sum  of  the  changes  in  kinetic  and  potential  energies  per  unit  volume  that  occur  during  the 
flow. Let us apply Bernoulli's Principle for the water in reservoir A and a stream of water from 
the nozzle. The potential energy of a unit volume of water on the level of the reservoir A and the 

nozzle  are  respectively 

2ghρ   and 

1ghρ ,  and  kinetic  energies  are  respectively  zero  and 

Thus we have from Bernoulli's equation

where  Patm  is  atmospheric  pressure.  The  speed  of  the  stream  of  water  from  the  nozzle  of  the 
fountain tube can be found easily from equations (2) and (1) as

Deriving equation (3) we assuming that a confined air is uncompressible and we neglecting the 
friction.  Of  course,  the  real  velocity  of  water  from  the  nozzle  will  be  less  than  it  is  given  by 
equation (3). Consider again the fluid as an ideal by moving the vessel C up and down we can 
change the gauge pressure  P∆  and as a result the speed of the water from the nozzle will change. 
When pressure  P∆  increases the speed of water increases and the water rises higher with respect 
to the nozzle creating the fountain effect and vice versus. If bottle C is lowered even further, then 
the  hydrostatic  pressure  increases  inside  C,  and  consequently  inside  B  as  well,  causing  the 
fountain  to  spray  even  higher.  Conversely,  if  bottle  C  is  raised  relative  to  the  bottle  B,  the 
hydrostatic pressure decreases, and the fountain spray diminishes.  

We  can  visualize  the  Hero’s  fountain  in  terms  of  potential  and  kinetic  energy.  At  the 
beginning the water is at its lowest potential energy in the lower vessel C. The water in the upper 
vessel  B  is  stationary.    It  does  not  begin  flowing  until  we  activated  the  fountain  by  adding 
additional  potential  energy  to  the  system  when  we  pouring  water  into  the  cup  A.  This  is  the 
activation energy of the system. Once the cup A and tubing is full, the potential energy between 
the upper and lower water levels in the vessels B and C determines velocity of droplets moving 
upwards.  At  the  nozzle  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  water  is  largest.  The  potential  energy  of  the 
water is largest at the highest point in the stream of the fountain of water.  
  

To make the magic fountain need three 2-liter plastic soda bottles, three rubber stoppers 
with two 1/8'' holes each, two plastic tubing about 2.5 ft long and 1/8'' glass tube about 3 ft long. 
Glass  tube  will  be  cut  on  five  pieces:  16'',  13",  3''  and  two  3.1/2''.  From  the  3.1/2''  glass  tube 
pieces make right angle bends with the side length 1.1/2''. The 16'' glass tube may be replace by 
metal  tube  of  the  same  diameter.  Insert  two  right  angle  bends  into  each  of  two  rubber  stoppers 
and then insert 16" fountain tube into second hole of these stoppers.  The cup A of the fountain is 
made from the upper 1/3 part of the plastic soda bottle by cutting it. Setting the cup A upright, 
connect it and partially filled plastic soda bottle B mouth to mouth using two rubber stoppers with 
right angle bends and fountain tube. Insert 13" and 3" glass tubes into the third rubber stopper and 
place it into the empty plastic coda bottle C. Finally connect the glass tubes of the bottle C and 
glass tube of bottle B and cup A with the plastic tubes. To start the fountain you should pour the 
glass  of  water  into  the  cup  A  and  stand  the  empty  bottle  C  lower  then  one  with  water.  The 
fountain works when leaks of water or air are escape. The magic fountain will act since all water 
of the upper bottle flows into the empty bottle. To restart the fountain you can replace the bottles 
and  again  pour  water  into  the  cup  A.  The  fountain  works  better  and  longer if the nozzle of the 
fountain tube is narrow. It spouts into the open air for a few minutes. For more impression use 
colored water or Coca-Cola. This dramatic presentation your whole class will love.

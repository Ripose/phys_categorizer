In  this  Letter,  we  propose  and  experimentally  demonstrate  a  simple  method  to  provide  additional
information by conductance measurements of soils. While the AC electrical conductance of the soil
is measured, it is exposed to a periodic vibration. The vibration-induced density fluctuation implies a
corresponding conductivity fluctuation that can be seen as combination frequency components, the
sum  and  the  difference  of  the  mean  AC  frequency  and  the  vibration  frequency,  in  the  current
response. The method is demonstrated by measurements on two different soil types.

Keywords: Soil water content; salinity; soil density; soil connectivity; soil conductivity.

1.  The new measurement principle
The  AC  conductivity  of  soils  depend  on  various  parameters,  such  as  the  water  content,
the  type  of  salts  and  their  concentration,  the  density  (air  content)  of  the  soil,  the
connectivity  structure  of  the  conducting  parts,  etc.  Therefore,  a  given  conductivity  can
belong  to  many  different  combinations  of  these  properties.  This  fact  implicate  that  the
information content of stand-alone AC conductivity measurements is relatively low. The
goal  of  this  paper  is  to  propose  and  demonstrate  a  new  technique  based  on  vibration-
induced modulation of the conductivity that gives additional and independent information
about the mechano-electrical transport properties of the soil. With proper models, these
transport  properties  can  provide  additional  information  about  the  structure  and
composition of the soil.

The  measurement  circuitry,  which  is  an  expanded  version  of  the  standard  AC
conductivity  measurement  circuitry,  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  AC  voltage  generator
provides a sinusoidal  voltage  at  the  main  frequency  f1 and  it  drives  an  AC  current

 through  the  driving  resistor  R1   and  the  resistor  Rs   represented  by  the  soil  sample.
The  soil  sample  is  exposed  to  a  periodic  vibration  with  frequency f 2 .  This  implies  a
periodic pressure modulation at frequency  2 f 2  inducing a conductance modulation with
2 f 2  first harmonics and that yields voltage components at the combination frequencies
  f1 + f 2  and   f1 - f 2  .

Figure 1. The measurement circuitry. The soil sample is exposed to a periodic vibration with frequency f2 . This
implies  a  periodic  pressure  modulation  inducing  a  conductance  modulation  with  2f2  first  harmonics  and  that
yields  voltage  components  at  the  combination  frequencies f1+2f2  and  f1-2f2 during  the  execution  of  an  AC
conductance measurement with sinusoidal voltage of frequency f1 .

At small and sinusoidal vibration and the corresponding linear response, the voltage on
the  soil  resistance  has  three  frequency  components.  At  the  frequency  of  the  voltage
generator  (main  frequency,  f1)  we  have  the  classical  AC  conductance  measurement
response (voltage divider response):

which allows us to determine the AC resistance of the soil sample from the measurement
of U2,1  in the classical way:

Supposing  small  modulation,  we  can  estimate  the  sensitivity  of  the  amplitude  U2,1
against the modulation of the soil resistance as follows:

  =  

U1(R1 + Rs - Rs )

and the fluctuation  amplitude  of  the  soil  resistance  can  be  determined  from  the  known
driving resistance  R1  and the measurement of the AC voltage amplitudes:

The  normalized  (relative)  resistance  fluctuation  is  especially  important  because  it  is
probing the strength of modulation of the electrical connectivity properties of the soil. Its
value can easily be determined from the above equations:

To evaluate the relative fluctuations of the resistance due to vibrations, we only need to
know the above voltage components at different frequencies and use Eq. 8.

2.  Experimental demonstration
The  test  experiments  were  carried  out  on  an  antivibration  table,  (100BM-2  Nano-K
vibration isolation platform). An induction coil based vibrator (5W, 60Hz) was fixed to
one side of the floating top of the antivibration table so that the vibration was horizontal
in a well-defined direction. The soil sample contained in a tin sample holder with 9.7 cm
of diameter and 6.3 cm of height was placed on this floating top. The ground contact was
the  metal  container  and  the  probing  contact  was  provided  by  a  standard  cylindrical
stainless steel electrode of a TDR (Time Domain Reflectometer). Figure 2 shows the top
view of the arrangement.

The vibration was very weak thus it did not cause any observable relaxation of the soil
structure. The voltage components at the combination frequencies were about 105  times
smaller than the amplitude at the main frequency.   The soils had clayey and fine sandy
texture (Table 1)

In Figure 3, the impact of moisture is shown. Due to the small diameter of the electrode
(3mm),  the  scattering  of  the  data  is  large  which  indicates  the  sensitivity  of  the  method
against  local  inhomogeneities.  The  scaling  plot  in  Figure  4  indicates  the  correlations
between scattering of  resistivity and fluctuation data. The differences between the three
different soil characteristics can clearly be seen.

3.  Summary
We  have  proposed  a  new  method  which  is  testing  the  mechano-electrical  transport
properties  of  soils.  The  normalized  fluctuations  shows  how  sensitive  are  the  structural
electrical  connectivity  properties  against  vibration.  This  is  an  independent  information
about the properties of the soils and can help to identify the status of a given soil more
securely.

The method was briefly demonstrated with cylindrical stainless steel electrodes. With
other  electrodes,  especially  with  larger  ones  with  wide  and  thin  blade  forms  there  is  a
good  potential  to  decrease  the  scattering  of  the  data  and  gain  information  about
anisotropy effects, too. Work is in hand to explore this possibility.

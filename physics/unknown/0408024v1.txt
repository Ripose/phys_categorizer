 Abstract 
 
    The approach to obtain the image shape of an optical diffraction radiation (ODR) source 
focused by lens on a detector with taking into account the “pre-wave zone” effect has been 
developed. In full analogy with optical transition radiation source the characteristic size of ODR 
slit image doesn’t depend on the Lorentz-factor and is defined by slit width, wavelength and lens 
aperture. 
    If a beam is passed through a narrow slit the shape of a slit image depends on a beam size. 
ODR generated by extremely ultrarelativistic beam passing through a narrow slit may be used to 
determine the beam size from ODR slit image. 
 
 
Keywords: optical diffraction radiation, pre-wave zone, beam profile monitor. 

 
 
     1. In the work [1] the authors have developed optical transition radiation (OTR) beam profile 
monitor  to  measure  a  transverse  size  of  an  electron  beam  with  the  resolution 
mcm.  The 
theoretical works [2-4] based on the wave optics have shown that the size of OTR source image  
(OTR  generated  by  single  dimensionless  particle)  is  determined  by  the  amplification  of  the 
optical system  M , the angular aperture of focusing lens  0θ  and OTR wavelength  λ :

value of a few wavelengths. The similar spatial resolution is sufficient for the diagnostics of the 
beams with the transverse sizes of the order of 5÷10 mcm. 
     But  as  it  has  been  mentioned  in  [1]  the  interaction  of  the  beam  with  small  transverse  sizes 
with target may lead to a changing of optical characteristics of OTR target after the passing of a 
few  bunches  with  the  population 
bunch
.
  That  is  why  the  methods  of  noninvasive 
diagnostics, where a beam doesn’t interact with a target directly are developing rather intensively 
in recent years [5]. The methods based on the use of optical diffraction radiation  (ODR) are the 
latest ones [6]. The spatial resolution of ODR beam profile monitor at the KEK-ATF extracted 
electron  beam  with  the  Lorentz-factor 
  has  been  investigated  in  the  cited  work.    The 
higher the energy of the beam particle is, the bigger the “natural” size of the luminescent area on 
the  target,  which  is  determined  by  the  parameter  γλ .    Thus,  the  distance  from  the  target  a , 
 can be observed as pointwise, increases 
where the similar OTR source with the divergence 
proportionally to the square of the Lorentz-factor [7]:

In other words, all  characteristics  of optical devices (including image size) set at the distances 
less than 
0L ,  (that is, they are situated in pre-wave zone following the terminology [7]) should 
be calculated with regard to the finite sizes of the luminescent spot.  
 
     For example, in case of SLAC FFTB beam with 
km for wavelength 
and an optical system  (a ~2 m) the characteristic relationship will be:  

 
8.1~0L
 mcm.  So, it is clear, that for a reasonable distance between a target

that is, the monitor is situated in the extremely  pre-wave zone. 
       
    2.  Let  us  consider  the  image  of  OTR  source  with  regard  to  the  “pre-wave  zone”  effect.  For 
simplification  of  calculations  let  us  consider  backward  transition  radiation  (BTR)  for 
perpendicular particle passing through the target. In real conditions the inclination of a target  ψ  
relative to the particle trajectory differs from 90о, but, as it has been shown in [8,9], the angular 
characteristics  of  BTR  of  ultrarelativistic  particles  in  a  wave  zone  (backward  diffraction 
radiation,  BDR,  as  well)  are  determined  relative  to  the  mirror  reflection  direction  and  don’t 
 is fulfilled. Following [3], let us 
depend on the slope of the target  ψ , if the relationship 
write the expression for TR field components generated by ultrarelativistic particle in an infinite 
perfect  target  L   with  the  focus  distance  f   on  the  detector  D (the  distance  between  the  target 
and  the  lens  stands  b ,  between  the  lens  and  the  detector  stands  a,  the  standard  relationship

 is fulfilled, see Fig. 1).

    The analogous dependences for the pre-wave zone are shown in figure 8. It can be noted that 
for ODR the pre-wave zone effect reveals slightly in the image plane. But the lens aperture, as in 
OTR  case,  influences  the  width  of  maxima  near  hole  edge  image  (see  Fig.  9).    At  aperture

    Using the formulas (13), (15) we can get ODR characteristics in a pre-wave zone for the disk

The formula (17) is in a good agreement with the result obtained earlier [11].  
But at the violation of axial symmetry of the task (for example, at the particle flight not through 
the center of the hole), the formulas obtained above don’t work. 
 
    4.  ODR beam size monitor [6] is based on the measuring of the degree of the deformation of 
ODR angular distribution from the slit in a wave zone generated by electron beam with finite 
transverse size, in comparison with the distribution from the infinite narrow beam. 
    To estimate whether it is possible to obtain the information about transverse sizes of the beam 
passing through the slit using the ODR slit image at the focusing on the detector, is of interest. In 
this case it is necessary to use Cartesian coordinates in the initial formulas. 
    As before, we shall   introduce Cartesian coordinates on the target, lens and detector using  T , 
L ,  D  indexes. Dimensionless variables will be introduced analogously (4):

    If the beam flying through the slit has a finite size the shape of the slit image will be distorted. 
It should be expected that the distortion degree of a perfect distribution “carries” the information

gives the opportunity to get the information about the transverse beam size. It is rather simple to

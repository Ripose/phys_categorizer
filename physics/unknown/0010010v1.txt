Abstract

in  a 

The ion-hose (or fast-ion) instability sets limits  on  the
allowable  vacuum 
long-pulse,  high  current
accelerator.    Beam-induced  ionization  of  the  background
gas  leads  to  the  formation  of  an  ion  channel  which
couples  to  the  transverse  motion  of  the  beam.    The
instability  is  studied  analytically  and  numerically  for
several ion  frequency distributions.    The  effects  of  beam
envelope oscillations on the growth of  the  instability  will
be  discussed.    The  saturated  non-linear  growth  of  the
instability  is  derived analytically and numerically for two
different ion frequency distributions.

1 INTRODUCTION

With  the  advent  of  DARHT-2  and  its  2  µsec  pulse
concern has surfaced over the ion-hose instability  that  may
arise from the  beam's interaction with  the  channel  created
from the background gas via collisional ionization [1].  We
consider a simple  model with  a t -dependent neutralization
(t  here is defined as  the  distance back from the  beam head
divided by b c).  The model we use for the  channel is  really
more  appropriate  for  a  channel  that  has  been  preformed
however  a  more  correct  treatment  (which  is  also  more
complicated)  produces  the  same  asymptotic  result  so  we
adopt this one for simplicity.    Let  y  represent the  centroid
position of the beam and y
 represents the centroid position
of  the  ion  channel.    We  consider  the  case  of  a  smooth
external focusing force (the case of  solenoidal focusing  is
well  represented in  the  asymptotic  solutions  by  replacing
kß    the  betatron  wavenumber  by  kc/2,  one  half  of  the
cyclotron wavenumber).  

Since  we will  also  follow  the  non-linear  development
of  the  instability  we  choose  as  a  starting  point  the
equations used by  Buchanan to  describe the  coupling  of  a
beam and channel, each assumed to have a Gaussian spatial
profile  [2].    The  beam  has  Gaussian  radius  a  while  the
channel has  Gaussian radius b  such  that  the  parameter  Ro
is given by

2 ” a2 + b2 .
Ro

This parameter results from integrating the force due to  the
beam over the  distribution  of  the  channel  and  vice  versa.

These equations are appropriate for a beam and channel
system  that  are characterized by  a  single  betatron  and  ion
“slosh” frequency.   We are treating  the  case  of  solenoidal
focusing  that  we  assume  is  dominant  compared  to  the
focusing provided by the ion channel.  Under this  condition

it is a good approximation to neglect the  spread in  betatron
frequency  that  will  result  due  to  the  non-linearity  of  the
beam-channel  force  which  arises  from  the  non-uniform
spatial profile of the channel.

However, it is  not  a good approximation to  ignore the
spread in  ion  resonance frequencies  which  arises  from  the
non-uniform spatial  profile of  the  beam.    To  account  for
this  spread  we  use  the  “spread  mass”  model  [3].    We
modify  the  model  by  splitting  the  channel  centroid  into
“filaments” labeled by a subscript l
 which characterizes the
frequency  of  a  particular  filament.  Equation  [10]  is  thus
modified as

¶ 2y l
¶ x 2

(

  [13]

The  position  of  the  channel  centroid  is  then  found  by
averaging the  individual positions  of  the  filaments  over  a
distribution function

y = f l(

y l dl .

and take a “top hat” distribution where

3 EFFECTS OF ENVELOPE

We now wish  to  investigate the  effects of  an envelope

instability.    Since  the  dominant focusing for the  beam  is
provided  by  the  solenoidal  field,  an  envelope  mismatch
will result in a beam radius that varies as

where we have assumed a particular choice of  phase for the
envelope oscillations  without  loss  of  generality.    Because
the channel is formed by the beam we can expect that  there
will be a similar variation for the channel radius.   Thus  the
ion  resonance frequency will  be periodically  varying  in  z.
This  is  analogous  to  the  case  of  “stagger  tuning”  the
resonant frequency of  cavities to  detune the  beam  breakup
instability.

We  will  investigate  this  effect  by  averaging  over  the
  and  x  oscillations  of  both  the  channel  and  beam

We see that  a small  envelope mismatch  can  significantly
reduce  the  linear  growth,  particularly  for  a  large  growth
rate.

4 NON-LINEAR DEVELOPMENT

It is clear from equations [2] through  [4] that  when the
beam  and  channel  displacements  become  of  order  Ro  the
beam-channel  force  falls  off  significantly  as  compared  to
the linear approximation used in equations [9] and [10].

We now  extend equation [13] into  the  non-linear  range

(for a Lorentzian distribution) as

5 CONCLUSIONS

the 
linear  growth  rate  of 

We have shown  that  envelope oscillations  that  lead to
ion  resonant  frequency
a  periodic  detuning  of 
significantly  reduce 
the
the 
instability.    In  addition,  when  the  amplitude  of  the  ion
channel  motion  becomes  of  the  order  of  Ro,  the  beam-
channel  force  falls  off  significantly  from  the  linear
approximation.  The betatron motion  of  the  beam/channel
causes a periodic modulation of the ion  resonant frequency
which increases the  effective damping of  the  oscillations.
This  effect  leads  to  the  saturation  of  the  beam  centroid
displacement at an amplitude that is of the order of  2d
y  or
about 10 - 30% of the channel amplitude.

The product of the bulk modulus and the molar volume is constant for materials with 

the same crystal structure.  Using this correlation a semi-empirical formula is suggested 

for describing the temperature dependence of the bulk modulus.

The relationship between the pressure and volume is described by the isothermal bulk 

modulus

where p is the pressure and V is the volume.  (It is assumed that the stresses are 

isotopic; therefore, the principal stresses can be identified as the pressure 

p

.)   The isothermal bulk modulus is pressure and temperature dependent;

therefore, it is necessary to know the derivatives of these parameters.

Based on shock-wave and static-compression measurements on metals linear 

relationship between the logarithm of the bulk modulus and the specific volume has been 

detected for metals [1].

where  α  is a constant depending on the material.  The linear correlation is valid up to 

40% volume change.  Using this linear correlation Jacobs and Oonk proposed a new 

equation of state [2].  They rewrite equation 3 as

data of  MgO,

 were successfully reproduced [2-4]. 

The product of the bulk modulus and the molar volume is almost constant for 

materials with the same crystal structure and independent of the mean atomic mass [5;6].  

If this correlation is correct then the temperature effect on the bulk modulus can be 

written.

Investigating the experimental data of different materials it has been found that if a 

constant multiplier is introduced, characteristic of the material, then the experimental data 

can be reproduced with high accuracy.

The correlation coefficients for the ten investigated substances are between 0.9972 and 

0.99997.  The results are given in Table 1.  The correlation described here can reproduce 

the experimental values of the bulk modulus with high accuracy for the entire 

temperature range of the solid phase (Fig. 1). 

Linear correlation between the constant multiplier and the molar volume at standard 

conditions were calculated (Fig. 2).  The correlation coefficient (R=0.62) might be higher 

if the crystal structure is the same; however, the number of data is not sufficient to check 

this assumption.  The detected correlation, Eq. 8, can be employed to extrapolate the data, 

measured at convenient temperatures, to any temperature range of interest.

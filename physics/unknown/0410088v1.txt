Introduction
The problem of the anomalous high periphery thermal transport at tokamak plasmas
and mechanism of their suppression, when a transport barrier is formed has been discussed
in  a  number  of  recent  publications  [1,  2].  This  paper  present  our  observations  and
conclusions about development of the transport process at the plasma periphery of the small
tokamak  FT-2  during  additional  Lower  Hybrid  Heating  (LHH),  when  external  (ETB)
transport barrier followed by Internal (ITB) transport barrier is observed [3, 4].

The  main  part  of  the  previous  papers  is  concerned  with  plasma  under  q = 6
(R=0.55m,  a=0.079m,  Ipl = 22kA  and  Bt = 2.2T,  PLHH = 90÷100kW),  where  the  effective
LHH and improved confinement transition are realised [3]. The L-H transition with ETB has
been observed after RF pulse end. The RF pulse (∆tLH = 5ms) is applied at the 30th ms of a
∆tpl = 50ms plasma shot. During additional LHH the ITB is formed spontaneously a few ms
after  the  RF  pulse  start.  The  essential  gradient  rise  of  the  ion  temperature  profiles  and  its
flattening in the core center during LHH indicates that ITB is formed at 32 – 33 ms in the r =
5 cm  region.  The  transport  barrier  formation  can  be  confirmed  by  time  history  of  the  ion
temperature  variation  obtained  by  CX  analyser  and  spectral  diagnostic  using  Doppler
broadening of the CIII line radiation and density profile changes [4].

It  should  be  stressed  that  in  our  papers  effective  LH  heating  and  spontaneous  ITB
formation  have been explained through careful numerical Monte Carlo modelling [5]. One
deduced that the high energy ions are well confined in the case, when poloidal Mach number
Mp =    ≥  1,  which  has  been  realised  in    FT-2  experiment  with  plasma  under  q = 6.    It  was
found the radial electric field provides a spontaneous transition to high negative value, if the
local Mach number is about one. This is partially due to rotational runaway due to negative
inertia  [6], and partially due to finite orbit effects [7].

The  L-H  transition  with  ETB  has  been  observed  after  RF  pulse  end.  Distinction  of
the mechanism which can trigger L – H transition is discussed in this paper. The paper deals
with the new microturbulence and spectral experimental data and their analysis, which show,
that the radial electric field Er generated at the LH heating (LHH) in the FT-2 is high enough
to form the transport barriers.

Experiment

I.
The paper deals with the structural feature of the Particle Fluctuation Induced Fluxes

near of the Last Close Flux Surface (LCFS). The peculiarities of the variations of the

fluctuation fluxes near periphery are measured by three moveable multielectrode Langmuir

probes (L-probe) located in the same poloidal cross-section of the chamber. The movable

multielectrode L-probes allowed us to study the behaviour of the local electron temperature,
plasma density, spatial potential, electric field, as well as 2D (poloidal cross-section) E×B
drift flux densities with respect to time practically at any poloidal angle [8]. The

measurements were carried out shot by shot with a radial (1 mm step size) and poloidal angle
spacing. The E×B drift flux can be expressed by the sum of the quasi-steady-state
Г0(t)=cn0(t)[E0(t),B]/B2 and fluctuation-induced Г~(t)=c[〈n~(t)E~(t)〉,B]/B2. The radial
~(t) = Cn(~)E(~)c〈n(~)2(t)〉1/2 〈Eθ
fluctuation-induced flux component can be expressed as Гr
(~)2(t)〉1/2/Bϕ, (angular brackets indicate averaging with respect to time). Here Cn(~)E(~) is the
correlation coefficient [1, 11]. To obtain the quasi-steady-state Г0(t) flux the low frequency
(smoothing) probe signal component was used. The turbulent Г~(t) flux is determined by the
digital or analogous treatment of the probe signal in the wide frequency (10 - 500 kHz)

range. Experiment shows that in the SOL plasma parameters depend not only on the minor
radius, but also on the poloidal angle θ.  For example, the maximum values of the electron
temperature (up to 40 eV at the LCFS) were observed at angles of θ= 900….1500 and
2200….2500 where the density is maximal. During LHH, the temperature distribution
became more flattened in the poloidal direction. In the post-heating phase (H-mode), the
distribution of Te (up to 20 eV) was strongly inhomogeneous with a pronounced maximum
at Low Field Site (LFS), θ = ± 100. Similar distributions of Te were observed also in the
deeper limiter shadow regions, which indicates that the plasma parameters in the SOL are

governed not only by radial heat fluxes, but also by other factors (e.g., poloidal particle
fluxes) [8]. One also notes that the radial profile of Te at same poloidal angels can be non-
monotonic. One should draw attention, that complicated energy balance of the SOL depends

on toroidal drift and longitudinal thermo-conductivity along magnetic lines. Additionally one
should take into account the small shift of the plasma core (a few mm) along of the major
radius during the LHH [8, 9].

II.
To measure accurately the change of main periphery parameters during one shot we
used specific L-probes localisation. One probe was located at the low field side with its axis
inclination in respect to the equatorial plane θ = 600, and the second one was located at the
high field side with inclination θ = 2300 [10]. The reading of the  θ value is taken from the
outward equatorial plane into the electron diamagnetic drift direction (the upward part of the
cross-section). The shape of the head of the probes and the inclination of the probes permits
to measure directly the vectors of the poloidal and radial electrical fields at once.  In such a

case  the  poloidal  and  radial  components  of  the  electrical  field  fluctuations  as  well  as  the
density fluctuations (saturated probe current), have been registered. This data permits direct
measurements  of  the  radial  and  poloidal  fluctuation  fluxes  during  a  single  discharge  with
subsequent calculation of the quasi-steady-state fluxes.

The  first  results  were  obtained,  that  permitted  to  make  the  following  conclusions
[10]: (i) the data demonstrate a number of both common and distinct features presenting the
poloidal inhomogeneity of the poloidal electric field and density fluctuations at the inner and
outer  perimeter  of  the  toroidal  plasma  core.  (ii)  The  fluctuation  particle  fluxes  consist  of
discrete blobs, which move as filaments. (iii) The blobs at high field side Θ=2300, r =7.4 cm
is  directed  mainly  outward.  The  frequency  of  the  spikes  and  their  dimensions  in  the
post-heating  phase  (in  H-mode)  are  lower  essentially  than  in  OH  (L-mode)  period.  The
fluctuation fluxes at low field side Θ = 600 are more non-uniform. That is confirmed by the
change  of  flux  direction  from  outward  to  inward  during  RF  pulse  at  r =7.9 cm.  (iv)  The
measured  shear  of  the  radial  electric  field  was  discussed  as  the  mechanisms  resulting  in
suppression  of  the  anomalous  particle  transport.  (v)  The  reduction  in  turbulence  induced
radial particle transport is due to both de-correlation of the E(~)
θθθθ and n(~) and changes in the
amplitudes of E(~)
θθθθ fluctuation level shows dependence on the sign of
Er shear. The sharp suppression of Eϑ fluctuation is registered when Er becomes negative and
shear of Er has the positive value, which is observed immediately after the end of RF pulse.
A sharp decrease of the density  fluctuation  is  supported  by  the  X-mode  reflectometry  also
after RF pulse at r = 7.5cm [4]. In this experiments we noted that fluctuation-induced Г~(t)
and  the  quasi-steady-state  Г0(t)  drift  fluxes  make  nearly  equal  contributions  to  the  radial
transport,  while  the  input  of  the  fluctuations  in  the  poloidal  plasma  flow  is  negligible  in
comparison with Γ0 [6].

So,  the  abrupt  rise  of  the  negative  Er  at  the  end  of  RF  pulse  could  result  in  L-H
transition.  To  reveal  the  mechanism  of  this
effect  we  have 
the
experiment  (#260504)  at  the  same  scenario
with LHH start at 30th ms. One L-probe was
located  at  the  low  field  side  with  its  axis
inclination in respect to the  equatorial plane
θ = 3100, and the second one is located at the
high field side with inclination θ = 2300. The
plasma  core  was  slightly  shifted  upward  (at
a ≅ 77 mm)  for  measurements  by  probes  in
the deeper layers and for some adjustment of
the  poloidal  parameters  symmetry.  The
scenarios  with  LHH  are 
the  same  as
mentioned  above  [10],  when  ITB  and  ETB
are formed. The Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate

changes  of  the  Te(r,  t)  and  ne(r, t)  profiles  during  LHH  near  the  LCFS  for  two  poloidal
angles. The L-probes are inserted deeper shot by shot into the plasma core up to 74 mm. The
SOL  and  limiter  shadow  region  run  from
~79 mm  to  81 mm  and  onward.  For  two

Te(r=74÷76mm)  decrease  faster  after  33 ms
in  comparison  with  Te  in  SOL,  where
longitudinal conductivity and poloidal fluxes

could  be  dominant.  The  Er= 
(3/e)(∂Te/∂r)  and  quasi  stationer  poloidal
flux  Γ0θ  are  shown  in  Figures  3  and  4.  The
Figures  illustrate  fast  rise  of  negative  value
of the Er and therefore Γ0 after the end of RF
pulse for two poloidal L-probe position. One
can see the appearance of the large  poloidal
quasi-steady-state flux shear and the point of
reverse  directions  of  the  fluxes,  which  can
stimulate  ETB  formation  with  large  density
gradient observed after the end of RF pulse at 35 ms. The time history changes of the plasma

periphery parameters NL,e(74mm), Eθ

shown  in  the  Fig.  5  for  L-probe  (θ = 2300  ,  HFS).  Hβ  radiation  and  small  shift  plasma
column ∆R are illustrated also. This data show, that during of the LHH (at 32 – 33ms), when
ITB is formed on r = 4-5cm, Cn(~)E(~) gradually decreases at all marked radii, the same as Hβ
radiation decreases. De-correlation effect runs from plasma core and obviously leads to the

measurements  did  not  show  any
decrease  of  the  turbulence  level  at
the  gradient  region  r = 5÷ 6.5 cm  during  LHH,  but  they  pointed  out  the  significant  rise  of
Vϑ(r = 5-6 cm)  from  ~  0  up  to  ~3 km/s  during  RF  pulse  in  the  electron  diamagnetic  drift
direction,  in  a  good  agreement  with  Vϑ,E×B  data  obtained  by  spectral  measurements  using
CIII line. Observed Vϑ  rise could perhaps trigger the ITB formation at 32–33 ms. Due to the
sizeable antenna diagram width in the near zone the interpretation of the reflectometry data
at the plasma edge  (r = 6.5 - 8 cm)  is not trivial and needs in  future  the  implementation  of
the  full  wave  modeling  for  taking  into  account  the  interference  between  probing  and
scattered radiation.

So  the  observed  L – H  transition  and  ETB  formation  after  LHH  and  the  associated
negative  Er  rise  [10]  are  resulted  mainly  from  the
decrease  of  the  Te  near  inner  region  of  the  LCFS  by
greater extent than in SOL. This effect is stimulated by
decrease  of  the  input  power  and  decrease  of  radial
Cn(~)E(~) 
radial  particle
fluctuation-induced Г~(t)) resulted from ITB formation
mechanism  during  LHH  [4].  Te  variation  in  the  SOL
after  LH  heating  pulse  takes  place  to  a  lesser  extent.
Observed nonmonotonic radial profile of Te near LCFS
with positive ∂Te/∂r rise is kept constant obviously by
large  longitudinal  conductivity  and  poloidal  fluxes
from  the  hotter  limiter  shadow  regions  because  of  the
poloidal  inhomogeneity  of  the  Te   SOL  and  ne SOL  [8].
Such induced negative Er after RF pulse gives fast rise
to  a  quasi-steady-state  Г0(t)  drift  fluxes  with  reversed

Large rise of grad(ne) after LHH near LCFS with L-H transition is observed  after the end of
LH pulse for a long time – about 10-15ms.

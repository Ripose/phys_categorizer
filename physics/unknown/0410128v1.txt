Abstract 
      The  dependence  of  the  relative  population  inversion  in  Er3+-doped  fiber  amplifiers  (EDFAs)  upon 
temperature  and  cross−sections  are  investigated  theoretically  by  the  modified  rate  equation  model  for  980  nm 
and 1470 nm pumping conditions. A relation between the signal gain and the pump power, which includes the 
effects  of  temperature  and  cross  sections,  is  obtained.  For  the  temperature  range  from  –  80  to  +  40  oC  and  at 
different  signal  wavelengths,  the  temperature  and  cross  section−dependent  gain  characteristics  with  respect  to 
pump  powers  are  also  examined  in  detail  for  the  both  conditions.  As  a  consequence,  the  dependence  of  the 
performance of EDFAs on temperature for 980 nm pumping is weaker than that for 1470 nm pumping, not only 
at room temperature but also at the temperature range of  0 to +50  oC. However, the performance of EDFAs is 
more efficient at the pumping wavelength of 1470 nm than that of 980 nm for a wide range of temperature and 
high-pump powers.

1. Introduction 
      The dependence of the gain in Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) upon  temperature is important for the 
system  applications  such  as  post  amplifiers,  in-line  amplifiers  and  preamplifiers.  In  addition,  emission  and 
absorption  cross-sections  also  affect  the  gain  performance  of  EDFAs.  Fuchtbauer-Ladenberg  (FL)  equation 
commonly depends on the experimental values obtained from fluorescence and absorption bandwidths. Whereas, 
McCumber  theory,  which  is  developed  for  the  study  of  phonon-terminated  lasers  based  upon  transition  metal 
ions  [1],  gives  a  more  accurate  expression  for  the  reciprocity  relation  between  absorption  and  emission  cross 
sections  than  FL  equation.  McCumber  relation  depends  on  temperature  and  requires  an  experimental  value  of 
emission cross section.  

     The  theoretical  investigation  of  EDFAs  by  using  the  rate  equations  is  based  on  the  determination  of  the 
population difference between amplification levels. The population difference depends on the parameters such as 
normalized  pump  photon  flux  (pump  power),  normalized  signal  photon  flux  (signal  power),  Boltzmann  factor 
and  cross-sections,  as  well  as  Er3+  concentration.  Mao  et  al.  and  Jaraba  et  al.  obtained  analytical  solutions  by 
including  cross-section  factors  [2-3]  but  they  are  for  the  room  temperature.  In  recent  works,  using  these 
solutions, the influence of erbium-doped fiber length on the gain characteristics of the EDFA was analyzed [4-5]. 
In  this  work,  the  rate  equations  are  modified  by  taking  temperature  and  cross  section  terms  into  account  to 
investigate the gain characteristics of EDFAs for a wide range of temperature. 

2. Descriptions and Theoretical Model 

     The  dynamic  behavior  of  EDFAs  can  be  explained  by  a  three-level  system  which  consists  of  ground, 
metastable and upper levels. The amplification process depends basically on the relative population inversion of 
the doping ions and the fluorescence lifetime of their exited state in the amplification medium. When the fiber is 
doped  with  Er3+  ions  or  with  ions  of  other  rare-earth  elements,  the  fiber  can  be  operated  as  an  active 
amplification medium that has to be pumped by the absorption of light from the pump source at either 980 nm or 
1470 nm.

important  factor,  because  the  gain  of  EDFAs  depends  firmly  on  the  relative  population  inversions.  If  the 
excitations for the both pumping configurations are very strong, then it can be written from Eqs. (5 and 14)

For the strong pumping, various transitions to the upper levels can be seen, which is so called the excited stated 
absorption (ESA). There is no ESA for 980 and 1470 nm pump wavelengths whereas it occurs for 510, 532, 665, 
810 nm pumping wavelengths and reduces the efficiency of EDFAs. Thus, EDFAs pumped at the wavelengths 
used here show not only the higher gain per unit pump power, but also the higher signal output power and the 
lower amount (a few decibels) of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise [10]. Therefore, the effect of ASE 
noise has not taken into account in this study.

signal  power  [12].  For  a  given  signal  power  and  various  pumping  powers  at  the  wavelengths  of    980 nm  and 
1470 nm, optimum gains corresponding to optimum lengths from Ref. [13-15] are calculated in the temperature

Table 1 

     For 1544 nm and 1531 nm signal wavelengths, the signal power is taken as 50 µW. The fiber lengths L are 
kept short to avoid saturation effects resulting from amplified spontaneous emission.    

     According to the results obtained in this study, the pumping at 980 nm (Figs.3a, b) shows higher population 
inversion  difference  than  that  of  1470  nm  (Figs.  2a,  b)  for  all  normalized  pump  rates.  For  1470  nm  pumping 
configuration, when the temperature is increased  from 0 oC  to + 50 oC, the population inversion obtained  from 
Eq.(5), which depends on both  β (T) and 
(T), decreases and its value for 1544 nm signal wavelength is lower 
than  that  for  1531  nm,  as  shown  in  Figs.  2(a,  b).  For  980  nm  pumping  configuration,  if  the  temperature  is 
oC to + 50 oC, the population inversion from Eq.(13) does not change for both 1544 nm and 1531 
changed from 0 
nm signal wavelength although it depends on  η (T), as shown in Fig.(3a,b).

      For the signal power of 50 µW and the both signal wavelengths, the gains obtained for the pumping at 1470 
nm (Figs. 4a,b) are higher than that of 980 nm (Figs.5a,b) in the high-pump-power region (≥ 25 mW). On the 
other hands, the reverse situation occurs in low-pump-power region (∼ 5 – 20 mW) (Figs. 5a,b). The difference in 
the gains is due to the greatness of absorption cross section at 980 nm pumping than that of 1470 nm and the 
smallness of LP01-mode size at 980 nm pumping than that of 1470 nm.

4. Conclusions 

     The  variation  in  the  relative  population  inversion  and  the  net  signal  gain  with  temperature  is  analytically 
investigated in the temperature range from 0 to +50 oC. It is seen that the gain in this temperature range increases 
for the certain pump and the signal wavelengths as the temperature decreases. The temperature dependency of 
the net signal gain as a function of launched pump power are investigated at the signal wavelengths of 1531 and 
1544  nm,  which  are  the  two  peak  wavelengths  in  the  signal  gain  spectrum  of  Er3+-doped  aluminosilicate  type 
optical  fiber.  All  figures  belonging  to  the  relative  population  inversion  and  the  net  signal  gain  show  that  the 
performance of EDFAs depends fairly on the temperature for 1470 nm pumping configuration. However, for 980 
nm, the gain depends on the temperature yet although the dependence of the relative population inversion upon 
the temperature is negligible. Consequently, regarding to the results from the rate equation model modified by 
including  temperature  and  cross  sections,  we  found  that  the  performance  of  EDFAs  is  more  efficient  at  the 
pumping wavelength of 1470 nm than that of 980 nm for a wide range of temperature and high pump powers.

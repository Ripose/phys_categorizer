The Spectrum of the light emitted by a sonoluminescing bubble is extremely well fit by 

the spectrum of a blackbody.  Furthermore the radius of emission can be smaller than 

the  wavelength  of  the  light.    Consequences,  for  theories  of  sonoluminescence  are 

discussed. 

     The phenomenon of sonoluminescence occurs when a trapped bubble of gas in water 

is driven into high amplitude pulsations by a strong sound wave. Key parameters that 

characterize  the  bubble  and  sound  field  are  the  amplitude  of  the  sound 

aP and  the 

ambient radius of the bubble 

0R . This is the radius when 

0=aP

. During the rarefaction 

portion of the cycle of sound the bubble expands from 

0R  to 

mR  the maximum radius 

that  is  about 

10R .  During  the  ensuing  compression  the  bubble  catastrophically 

0

collapses right through 

0R  on its way down to its collapsed radius 

cR  that is determined 

by the van der Waals hard core of the particular gas molecule [for Helium 

Rc =

0R

10

]. 

As  R  approaches 

cR   the  input  acoustic  energy  density  concentrates  by  12  orders  of 

magnitude [11] and leads to the emission of a broad band flash of light whose width is 

delineated in picoseconds.  

     Plasma  processes  have  been  invoked  by  a  number  of  researchers  as  the  basis  for 

explaining  the  light  emitting  mechanism  [5,  12-17].  Atoms  that  are  neutral  at  low 

 

2

temperatures  ‘T’  become  ionized  as  T  increases  inside  the  collapsed  bubble.  In  the 

resulting  plasma  charged  particles  emit  and  absorb  light  through  various  processes.  

Electrons moving with the thermal velocity can collide with neutral atoms or with ions 

to  radiate  light  as  they  accelerate [thermal  Bremsstrahlung].  Light  propagating  in  the 

plasma  can  be  absorbed  by  the  inverse  of  these  processes  as  well  as  by  ionizing 

collisions  with  atoms.  If  the  distance  that  light  propagates  from  generation  to  re-

absorption  γl  is small compared to the size of the plasma then the medium is opaque 

and the spectrum will be that of a blackbody and radiation is from the surface [1]. For 

large values of  γl  the body becomes transparent.  Radiation is emitted form the volume 

of  the  bubble,  so  therefore  the  spectrum  yields  information  about  the  underling 

collisional processes. 

     For  hydrogen  at  6000K  and  a  density  of  2.3x1022  molecules/cm3,

number  is  much  greater  than  the 

mµ35.

  radius  of  the  collapsed  bubble  [18]  and 

therefore also greater than Re.  Similar calculations have led researchers to claim that 

the  sonoluminescing  medium  is  a  transparent  plasma  [12-17,19].  Nevertheless,  we 

observe  the  blackbody  behavior  shown  in  Figure  1.  Reconciliation  of  theory  and 

experiment must be sought in the fact that the contents of the SL bubble are very dense, 

being compressed to the van der Waal’s hard core [5,11]. Saha’s equation for the degree 

of ionization and the standard Bremsstrahlung formulas [including  rl ] are calculated in 

the dilute gas limit where behavior is dominated by binary collisions. This could be the 

opposite limit to the one that describes SL [17]. A mechanism where a ‘cool’ blackbody 

 

3

spectrum  can  mask  an  arbitrarily  high  interior  temperature  [and  shorter 

rl ]  is  pre-

heating due to thermal radiation transport that is set off by a shock wave [1].  

     Another paradox of the blackbody interpretation of SL relates to the density of states. 

The derivation of Planck’s formula assumes that many modes [i.e. many wavelengths of 

light] fit into the hot blackbody, but the SL hot spot is smaller than the wavelength of 

light that we measure. Perhaps those processes that lead to a small  rl  also lead to a large 

index of refraction [and therefore a smaller  λ] inside the hot spot. In this model light 

would be released as 

rl  suddenly increased in the cooling hot spot.  The existence of 

such a switching process inside the bubble is suggested by the plot in Figure 2B which 

shows that the ratio of the ionization temperature to the blackbody temperature is the 

same value for all noble gas bubbles. That noble gas bubbles are accurately described 

by Planck’s formula is shown in Figure 2A.  

     Measurements  of  the  flash  width  as  a  function  of  color  also  support  a  switching 

mechanism. It is found that between 200nm and 700nm the flash width varies by less 

than 20% [being longer in the ultra-violet! {18}].  Within the absolute timing resolution 

of  about  40ps  it  appears  that  the  spectrum  is  blackbody  from  start  to  finish.  Such 

behavior is also found to exist in plasmas that are generated at the focus of a strong laser 

in water [20]. 

     A clue to the transition from opaque to transparent behavior is suggested by Figure 3 

that displays the SL spectrum of a cloud of cavitating argon bubbles driven by sound at 

1MHz [21]. The spectrum of light generated at this higher acoustic frequency is not well 

described  by  Planck’s  formula,  but  is  characteristic  of  formulas  for  thermal 

 

4

Bremsstrahlung[1]. The radii,  cR , of the 1MHz bubbles [21] at the moment of collapse 

are so small [

≈

cR

 50nm] that perhaps these bubbles are transparent to light. Thus for 

SL the transition from opaque [blackbody] to transparent takes place at around 100nm.  

The  robust  behavior  of  SL  even  at  the  nanoscale  has  been  pushed  to  11MHz  where 

scaling arguments suggest that 

10≈

nm

cR

. The spectral densities at 1MHz and 11MHz 

are similar [Figure 3].      

     The transduction of sound into light by a collapsing bubble is robust down to the 

nanoscale. Although radiation is emitted from a surface whose radius is smaller than, 

the wavelength of light and the photon matter mean free path, the observed spectrum 

can  match  that  of  a  blackbody  for  [

200

nm

  and

].  Whether 

eR

blackbody behavior extends out into the Rayleigh-Jeans limit of large  λ is a question 

for future experiments. As an equilibrated blackbody radiates only from its surface the 

extent to which the bubble’s contents are stressed may be unrepresented in the observed 

spectrum. The spatial correlations and mode counting dilemma that would characterize 

such a small blackbody could constitute a new regime for the application of statistical 

optics.  The inability to reconcile the long photon mean free path with the smallness of 

the hot spot suggests new physics in the modeling of SL.

cylindrical  resonators  constructed  with  quartz  walls  and  stainless  steel  end-caps  [5]. 

Spectra were measured with light falling directly on the input slit (through order sorting 

filters) of a spectrometer (Acton 308i) read out by an intensified CCD (Princeton Inst. 

IMAX) and are fully radiance calibrated against commercially available QTH and D2 

lamps.    Spectra  in  figures  1  and  3  acquired  through  commercial  grade  quartz  (GM 

assoc. # 214) whereas fig2 is acquired in cells constructed of ‘suprasil’.  No spectra are 

corrected for transmission of water or quartz.  For our commercial grade quartz, there is 

absorption for wavelengths below 300 nm that rises to 25 % at 200nm. The suprasil has 

constant transmission for all wavelengths above 200nm.  We attribute the bump in the 

data at 550 nm and the dip at 360 nm to documented errors in the manufacturer-supplied 

calibration of our lamps (see fig 75 reference 5).

9. Spectra reported here have the same spectral density and detailed shape as reported in 

previous papers. But in the course of recalibrating the system we find that the scale for 

the ‘y’ axis, namely spectral radiance, is generally lower, being down by about a factor 

of 12 compared to 4,6. We have verified the new data calibrated against various lamp 

standards  with  photon  counting  through  bandpass filters.  Previously  quoted  values of 

photons per flash remain unchanged. We believe that the mistake in scaling the ‘y’ axis 

is greater than can be accounted for by resonator variability, drive level, and thermal 

drift  [see  discussion  in  ref.5].  The  corrected  value  of  radiance  plus  our  ability  to 

measure  flash  width  and  bubble  size  combine  to  make  possible  the  quantitative 

comparisons to blackbody radiation proposed here.

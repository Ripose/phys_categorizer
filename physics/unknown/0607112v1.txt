Pure shear surface waves guided by the free surface of a magneto-electro-elastic material are investigated. Three 

surface waves are obtained for various magneto-electrical conditions on the free surface of the magneto-electro-

elastic half-space. The velocities of propagation and the existence conditions for each of these waves are obtained in 

Keywords: Magneto-electro-elastic material; Surface wave; Piezoelectric; Piezomagnetic; Bleustein-Gulyaev 

Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are widely used in numerous branches of science and technology and 

their investigation especially in the case of interconnected physical fields in general is an important and actively 

developing branch of research and applications. About 120 years ago the first type of SAW was described by Lord 

Rayleigh (1885) in connection with the problem of earthquakes. Bleustein (1968) and Gulyaev (1969) for the first 

time theoretically predicted that a pure shear SAW can be guided by the free surface of a piezoelectric half-space. 

Their fundamental results lay in the bases of  further developments of acoustoelectronics and currently are cited in 

more than 350 original papers.

Recent developments in physics and technology made possible to construct new materials called magneto-

electro-elastic materials which demonstrate interconnection between magnetic, electric and elastic fields (Nan, 1994; 

Srinivas et al. 2006). When the electric field was connected with the elastic one (the piezoelectric materials) it 

brought up new and unexpected possibilities for science and technology. Connecting the magnetic field with the 

electric and elastic ones in magneto-electro-elastic materials suggests a range of new possibilities. 

In this paper an investigation on the existence of pure shear surface acoustic waves in a magneto-electro-elastic 

half-space is conduced. It is shown that three different surface acoustic waves can be guided by the free surface of 

the magneto-electro-elastic half-space in the cases of different magneto-electrical boundary conditions. The first 

SAW disappears and the other two degenerate to the Bleustein-Gulyaev surface wave when the piezomagnetic and 

the magnetoelectric coefficients tend to zero, thereby recovering the situation present in piezoelectric materials. 

These results are important in the further investigation of the dynamic behavior of magneto-electro-elastic materials 

and will have numerous applications in SAW devices.

 the corresponding 

analysis shows that no surface wave can be guided by the surface of the magneto-electro-elastic half-space. 

From Eqs. (13), (17), (19), (22), (24), (26) follows that the existence criteria for the three surface waves are the 

following: 

n ≠  for existence of the surface wave with velocity

magneto-electro-elastic materials merge with each other and recover the Bleustein-Gulyaev surface wave present in 

the piezoelectric materials when the electromagnetic constant

4. Conclusions 

The existence of pure shear surface waves in magneto-electro-elastic materials is investigated. It is shown that 

three surface waves can be guided by the free surface of a transversely isotropic magneto-electro-elastic half-space 

in  the  cases  of  different  magneto-electrical  boundary  conditions.  The  existence  criteria  and  the  propagation 

velocities of each of these three waves are obtained in explicit exact forms. The first surface wave vanishes, while 

the other two surface waves merge and recover the Bleustein-Gulyaev surface wave of piezoelectric materials when 

the piezomagnetic and the magnetoelectric coefficients tend to zero.

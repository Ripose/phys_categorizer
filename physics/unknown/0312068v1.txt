Contemporary  observational  and  theoretical  studies  on  the  temporal  nature  of
microscopic  measurements  renewed  the  discussion  about  the  fundamental  constants,
leading to the possibility of light speed variation and superluminal  pulse propagation.
Gain assisted experiments using anomalous dispersion near an absorption line in atomic
gas, a "fast – light" medium , seem to lead to a wave group velocity vG exceeding c, the
vacuum  speed  of  light;  moreover,  definition  of  the  information  velocity  vi  sets  the
question of interpretation of the three speeds: one view is that vi = vG , but this violates
Causality;  another  view  is  that  vi  =  c  in  all  situations,  but  this  limits,  a  priori,  the
transport of information. Another view is that vi , vG and c are distinct. This contribution
follows the last possibility. A draft discussion on space-time is given.

The speed of light has so many facets [1] and is not exactly defined mainly due to two
reasons: from one side, any pulse  comprises a set of  elementary waveforms, each one
with a particular frequency; the second point is that laboratory tests mixes two beams –
the one that is being measured and the one that is used to transport the information, that
is, to establish the base-time.
Superluminal [2-5] detection can be based on anomalous dispersion [6], or the existence
of  a  large  discontinuity  in  the  dispersion  curve  as  it  crosses  an  absorption  band  of  a
substance, so that longer wavelengths are more refracted than the shorter ones. If a light
pulse of frequency w and bandwidth Dw enters a dispersive medium of refractive index
n(w), it's peak is supposed to propagate at the group velocity vG = c / nG whereas each
sinusoidal component travels at a phase velocity vPH = c / n(w); since the group index nG
can  be  written  in  terms  of  the  refractive  index  n(w),  nG    @  n(w)  +  wdn(w)/dw|w=wo  ,
where  wo  is  the  central  frequency  of  the  wavepacket,  in  spectral  regions  where  n(w)
decreases with w (dn(w)/dw < 0 ) , the group index is less than the refractive index and
can even become less than 1, resulting in a "fast–light" vG > c .
Current experimental arrangements [7] (Fig.1) use the technique of tuning a pulse near
and  far  from  the  atomic  resonance  –  wR  –    of  a  vapour.  When  w  ~  wR  ,  the  pulse
interacts with the "fast-light" medium and experiences an advancement; we refer to this
velocity as vG. Far from wR , there is no interaction and the velocity is vi, usually taken
as c, the speed of light in vacuum, under the  argument that the  "fast-light" medium is
equivalent  to  vacuum  when    w  „  wR.  Alternatively,  figure  2  pictures  an  experimental
set-up based on tuning  a "fast-light" optical medium on / off instead of tuning a laser
near  and  far  from  the  atomic  resonance.  This  set-up  discriminates  the  pulses
propagating through vacuum ( information velocity vi ) from pulses propagating through
the  "fast-light"  medium  (  group  velocity  vG  );  we  hope  that  this  can  also  help  to
distinguish a signal (or pulse) propagating through vacuum – vi from the speed of light
in vacuum – c .

beam (wR) tuned near  (DwR)  the  atomic  resonance  is  mixed  with  a  beam  (wo)  centred
between  the  gain  resonances,  produces  a  pulse.  Dt  is  the  "advancement"  of  this  pulse

Figure 2 An equivalent circuit :  source L1 starts detector D emitting a wave packet that
propagates trough the upper arm at velocity v1 . At T (Xf ) the wave packet triggers the
source  L2  that  emits  the  signal  vi  trough  the  vacuum  tube;  this  signal  stops  D  (Xo).
When the upper arm is filled with an atomic vapour, v1 equals the group velocity vG and
a  superluminal  regime  is  established.  Pumping  out  the  gas,  v1  equals  the  information
velocity  vi  ;  a  balance  between  vG  and  vi  is  achieved  by  measuring  the  time  interval
registered by D .

the time delay of the circuit; let this include the response time of  "T" and "D".

time of  "T"  could be different for pulses vG and vi ; again, let this include the response

This means that  the  experimental  quantity  DtG,D  is  completely  (exactly)  determined  in
terms of the elapsed times DtG  and Dti ; but DtG  and Dti are not experimental quantities,
they can't be – strictu sensu –  directly measured. However, employing the space-time
platform, that is, the definition of time in terms of velocity and length, the last equation
can be written as:

where the terms on the right side represent a way to determine ( not to measure) DtG,D .
Now  it  comes  the  task  of  attributing  significance  to  DtG,D;  it  turns  out  that  this
experimental quantity can be associated to the measurable value of the group velocity -
vG , which can be written as :

where  the  subscript  "D"  has  been  added  in  order  to  emphasise  that  vG,D  is  the
experimental  value  of  the  group  velocity  vG  ,  that  is,  the  velocity  that  would  be
measured  if,  instead  of  the  photodetector  "D"  calibrated  in  s–1    we  had  employed  a
photoreceiver ( namely, a space velocity detector) calibrated in m/s. By noting (Fig. 2)
that  the  wavepacket  vG  flows  in  the  vapour  arm  whereas  information  vi    flows  in  the
vacuum arm and since the length Dx can be directly measured, Eq. (6) into (5) gives:

implying  that  the  group  velocity  can  only  be  determined  in  terms  of  the  information
velocity:

Now it is possible to examine the role of  c, vi  and  vG :
One  view  is  to  insert  vi  =  vG    into  Eq.  (8);  this  gives  a  superluminal  interpretation
(vG ~ 2 vG,D ) once the group velocity appears as twice its experimental value, somehow
violating causality. But this is equivalent to an experimental set-up (Fig.2) in which the
vacuum  arm  is  filled  with  atomic  vapour  –  the  "fast-light"  medium  –  so  that  the
wavepacket    vG  carriers  its  own  information,  giving  rise  to  a  subluminal  detection  or
sensation (vG,D = ½vG). Since this does not correspond to the actual experiment, both the
interpretation (vi = vG ) and the sensation (vG,D = ½ vG) are misleading.
The second view is to insert vi = c into equation (8); however, equations (7) and (8) are
written in the velocity-space ( Boltzmannian sense) platform whereas c belongs to the
space-time (  Newtonian and Einstenian sense)  platform.  In  fact,  c  appears  as  a  space-
time  synthesiser,  so  the  dimensionless  ratio  vG,D  /  vi  is  incompatible  with  a  vG,D  /  c
interpretation  by  construction  of  the  argument  leading  to  the  existence  of  the
information  velocity  vi.  Indeed,  the  numerical  value  bellow  vG,D  in  Eq.  (8)  is  not
arbitrary, once it defines a basis (platform) in terms of which vG is being measured. In
order to transform from one platform to the other, it is necessary to measure vi that, as
vG , is unknown in Eq. (8).
For the vacuum regime, Eq. (2), we have:

where the first Dti represents the flow trough the "vapour arm" ( now evacuated) and the
second  Dti  the  flow  trough  the  vacuum  arm  (Fig.2)  ;  again,  Dti,D  and  DtR,i  are  the
experimental (measurable) quantities; since the last asserts only the precision of the test,
an exact result is:

Perhaps the most striking feature of ordering objects is the outcome with which they can
be  characterised;  for  instance,  one  consequence  of  the  arrangement  of  the  title  is  the
association  between  the  words  light  and  fast.  There  seems  that  light  is  fast  but  these
objects  (words)  are  just  relative  so  those  words  (objects)  should  be  balanced  among
themselves or between similar entities. In fact, Eq. (8) balances two velocities and says
that  the  faster  the  information  velocity  is,  more  and  more  the  experimental  value
approaches  the  true  one,  or  better  the  result  obtained  for  the  group  velocity.  This  is
quite a reasonable result.
On  the  other  hand,  the  vacuum  regime  represents  an  experimental  set  up  where
information is balanced by  itself  and  Eq. (12)  says  that  if  vi  =  c  ,  vi,D  ~  c/2  .  But  this
contradicts the experimental fact that the speed of light in vacuum is c. Thus we are led
to  admit  that  it  is  vi,D  ,  the  experimental  value  of  vi,  that  equals  the  speed  of  light  in
vacuum, so that vi ~ 2c. Inserting this rough, though reasonable result into Eq. (8), we
have:

Note that this equation is written in the velocity-space platform; the quantities vG,D and
2c  are  known  from  experiment  so  that,  the  fundamental  problem  of  "velocimetry",
reduces  to  the  problem  of  establishing  a  velocity  scale.  That  is,  the  experimental
quantities  that  are  (independently)  measured  in  determining  an  unknown  velocity  (vG)
are quantities of velocities rather than lengths and times. In technical terms (Fig.2), this
corresponds to a velocity measurement employing a space velocity  detector  calibrated
in  m/s  and  located  at  the  end  (Xf)  of  the  upper  arm  (note  that  the  lower  arm  is
unnecessary in this case) instead of a photo-detector "D" calibrated in s–1. In theoretical
terms, this corresponds to a transformation [8] from space-time to a velocity-base given

whereas  the  right  side  terms  in    Eq.  (7' )  are    written  in  the  velocity-space.  Though
measurements  consist  of  a  set  of  dimensionless  ratios,  it  seems  that  no  one  has  ever
measured a velocity in the manner described above. The c velocity scale is established
by correcting the readings of a "velocimeter" to what they would be if  the motion were
ideal,  that  is,  static  vG,D  /  vi  ~  0  .  In  short:  a  superluminal  effect  can  be  observed,
depending on how fast information is transported and is a result related to the fact that
velocities are underestimated in space-time. This effect is due to the limited value of vi .
In order to see that it is vi and not c the responsible for the spatiotemporal structure – the
causal connection –  let us first consider Fig. 2 and then equation (8).
From the experimental point of view, a measurement is completed when information is
inside a  detector;  according  to  Fig.2, detector "D"  is  fixed  at  Xo  and  experiences  two
moments:  the  moment  the  wavepacket  v1  is  launched  (ON)  and  the  moment  the
information vi arrives (OFF); these two moments give rise to a single time Dtm (Eq. (3)).
One  moment  defines  a  point  in  time,  but  not  a  point  in  space-time.  In  German  this
sounds more robust: moment = zeitpunkt. This suggests that point Xo belongs to space-
time  but  point  Xf  belongs  to  the  velocity-space,  so  that  Xo  is  a  point  of  Simultaneity
whereas Xf is a point of Synchronicity. Synchronism, or the causal connection between
both points is achieved, experimentally,  by  vi  and  not  by  c.  c  is  just  the  result  (or  the
synthesis) of the connection between space and time; the responsible is vi .
From  the  conceptual  point  of  view,  Eq.  (8)  and  more  precisely  Eq.  (7)  say  that  the
measured  value  of  the  group  velocity  is  the  medium  value  obtained  by  the  harmonic
relation between the actual flow velocity and the information velocity. The "collapse" of
the  two  velocities,  vG  and  vi  ,  leading  to  the  measured  value  vG,D    embodies  the
measurement uncertainty. A plot of equation (8) in units of c is given in figure 3.

Figure 3  Group velocity in terms of the measured value; the line crossing 2c is vi .

Adopting positive velocities as those signals starting from the source point Xo in Fig.2,
we  note  that  the  vertical  axis  in  Fig.3  is  distorted  due  to  the  finite  value  of  vi  and
"delayed" according to Eq. (1' ); in fact, the velocities in Eq. (7) should be associated to
the times in equation (1' ). Formally, the reciprocal velocity vector addition 1/ vG + 1/ vi
is  completely  defined  by  the  coordinates  of  its  end  point,  1/  vG,D  .  We  can  therefore

6

speak  of  this  end  point,  instead  of  the  reciprocal  vectors  themselves,  and  describe  the
measurement problem as that of determining the way these representative end points are
distributed in the velocity space. On the opposite, in the preceding paragraphs we noted
that vG,D is completely determined by its space-time coordinates – Eq. (6' ); therefore, in
terms of  temporalities, this seems to imply that the arrowhead of the reciprocal vector
1/ vG,D is centred on Past, or that this vector points to past, so that the useful portion of
Fig.3,  the  first  quadrant  (vG,D  <  vi  ),  can  be  associated  to  Past.  The  limitation  of  our
observation is thus translated as a delay or in the fact that all measurement is a detection
of  what  has  passed.  But  the  measurement  problem  can  be  stated  in  another  way:
employing Eq. (8) and its counterpart, Eq. (1' ), together with the definition of velocities
in space-time,

and taking

where  Dt  =  t  –  to  is  formally  associated  to  Dti  ,  so  that  one  could  refer  to  the  four
dimensional point (x, y, z, t) as an "event" in space-time; note, however, that an event is
defined (a measurement is completed) only when/where information is inside a detector
located in the space-time point (xo, yo, zo, to).
According to special theory of relativity, no signal can cause an effect outside the light
cone [9], defined as the space-time surface on which light rays emanate from the source;
here we note that according to Fig.3, equation (15) is the "usual" space-time counterpart
of the velocity-space equation (8), provided the role of the speed of light is played by
the information velocity in the last term, that is, the temporal line element 4c2dt = vi
2dt.
Further, since causality is intrinsic, by construction ( Fig.2; equation (8)), we may ask
that equation (15) represents  a  causal  cone  that  will  coincide  with  the  light  cone  only
under  special  circumstances.  Let  us  examine  this  cone  in  terms  of  the  remaining
temporalities, Present and Future, that necessarily should appear in Fig.3 .
In order to reduce the delay, that is, to approach the measured value to the actual one,
one could assume, as usual,  that vG equals vG,D. But this means that uncertainty relations
( such as equation (4) ) do not hold. A more sounded physical assumption is to increase
vi or equivalently reduce vG.  This is equivalent to a translation of the  fourth quadrant
curve  to  the  vG  =  0  point,  generating  a  "cone"  centred  on  this  point.  Since  this
corresponds to a perfect measurement (no delay), the fourth quadrant curve should  be
associated  to  Present.  In  other  words,  the  light  cone  collapses  Present  to  a  point  in
space-time  whereas  the  causal  cone  reveals  the  full  curve  (a  surface  in  velocity  or
momentum-space  )  beyond  the  information  velocity.  This  limit  (vG  =  0)  appears  as  a
classical (Newtonian) particularity, where the actual value of the velocity corresponds to

7

the measurement, an "effect" due to the "infinite" value of vi , that is, an ideal (static)
measurement.  Causality  is  preserved  for  all  positive  velocities  in  this  plot,  provided
vi > vG,,D . On the other hand, a faster than vi signal appears either  as positive velocity
(vG,,D ) in the fourth quadrant or as a negative one in the third. The former lacks physical
importance mainly due to the reason that it implies an effect preceding its cause or an
exchange between Past and Future. Note that this is equivalent to measure a light pulse
employing,  for  instance,  a  sound  wave  as  vi.  The  latter,  however,  has  a  physical
meaning if we adopt negative velocities as those signals arriving in the source point Xo
in  Fig.2.  There  are  two  such  signals:  those  coming  from  point  Xf  ,  that  is,  the
information  vi  and  those  yet  unemitted  signals,  that  is,  signals  that  will  come  into  the
apparatus  in  near  future.  Indeed,  since  it  is  the  value  of  vi  that  determines  the
measurable limit at 2c and those detectable signals are restricted to vi ‡ | vG |, it can be
argued  that  point  Xf  in  Fig.2  belongs  to  (far)  future,  so  that  information  is  always
coming  from  future.  It  follows  that  the  experimental  process  pictured  in  Fig.2
discriminates temporalities and hence the familiar notion of "absolute" time, revealing a
temporal  dependence  on  the  relative  magnitude  and  sign  of  the  signals.  This  is
accounted for by vi , the responsible for the space-time causal connection and not by c,
the synthetic result of causality.
To conclude, we note that: 1. The possibility that the fundamental space-time constant c
may vary exists but, detection of such a variation is limited in space-time (Michelson-
Morley  type  experiments)  due  to  the  finite  value  of  the  information  velocity;
2.Superluminal experiments do not test causality; they verify the uncertainty principle;
and it holds; 3. Due to the uncertainty principle and to the constant experimental value
c, light, itself is superluminal. 4. If one were to prove mentally that c < vi ~2c , then the
standard  derivation  of  special  relativity  would  have  to  be  revised;  5.  The  distinction
among  vG,  vi  and  c  do  not  contradict  variable  speed  of  light  theories,  superluminal
phenomena, neither shakes the overall validity of special relativity;  it  could,  however,
nullify derivations of the Lorentz transformation based on the invariance of the photon

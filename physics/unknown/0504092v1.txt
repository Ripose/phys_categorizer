Introduction (Summary) 

As  shown  in  the  previous  publications,  the  shape  of  the  histograms  constructed  by 
measurements  of  alpha-activity  of  samples  of  239Pu,  changes  with  periods  equal  approximately  24 

hours, 27 days, and a year. At a higher resolution each of these periods splits as a minimum in two 

components: daily period consists of two: sidereal day (1436 minutes) and solar day (1440 minutes), 

27-days period splits in 2 to 3 “sub-periods”, and the yearly period appears to be a join of “calendar” 

period (which is equal to 1440 х 365 = 525600 minutes) and “solar” period (equal to [(1440 х 365) + 

369] =525969 minutes) [4].  

In the present paper results of more detailed research of this phenomenon are offered. 

Materials and methods 

Initial  materials  in  our  research  are  results  of  measurements  of  alpha-activity  of  samples 
239Pu by semi-conductor detectors. Measurements are conducted with one-second intervals round the 

clock,  during  many  years  [1-4].  We  build  histograms  by  results  of  measurements  and  estimate 

similarity of histogram shapes. The detailed description of methods of measurements, construction 

of  histograms  and  comparison  of  histogram  shapes,  and  also  criteria  of  an  estimation  of  statistical 

reliability of obtained results are published in [1-4,8,9]. Histograms built either by 60 results of one-

second  measurements  –“one-minute  histograms”,  or  by  60  results  of  one-minute  measurements  – 

“hourly histograms”. 

The basic object in the present research is dependence of likelihood of repeated occurrence of 

histograms of the given shape on size of time interval dividing similar histograms.

Results 

On  Fig.1  the  typical  result,  dependence  of  likelihood  of  repeated  occurrence  of  hourly 

histograms of the given shape on size of time interval dividing similar histograms, is represented. On 

Fig.1 two major effects are visible.

1)  Effect of “a near zone” – significantly higher likelihood of similarity of the form of the 

2)  About-daily period of repeated occurrence of histograms of the similar shape. 

95 % confidential intervals for peaks at 1 and 24 hours (calculated by  Poisson distribution 

[6]) confirm reliability of observable effects.

histograms of the given shape on size of time interval dividing similar histograms. 
Measurements  of  alpha-activity  of  a  sample  239Pu  by  detector  with  static 

collimator,  directed  to  the  West,  June  8  –  30,  2004.  Abscissa  is  time  interval  in  hours. 

Ordinate  is  number  of  similar  histogram  pairs.  95%  confidence  intervals  for  peaks  at  1  and  24 

hours are marked. 

  Measurements June 8 – 30, 2004 during 538 hours. 14526 pair comparisons are made. 1323 similar pairs (9,1 %) 

are chosen. The height of peak at  24 hour interval  makes 122 pairs or about 24 % from greatest possible. A background 

about 8 %. Peak of  “a near zone” is 86 pairs or about 16 %.

A similar distribution, though at a higher resolution – for one-minute histograms, is presented 

at Fig.2. Now an individual hourly interval at Fig.1 corresponds to 60 one-minute intervals at Fig. 2.  

At such resolution about-daily period was divided into two components: the first is equal to 

1436  minutes  («sidereal  day»),  and  the  second  is  1440  minutes  («solar  day»).  Thus,  the  shape  of 

histograms is defined by an exposition of the laboratory to both: the celestial sphere, and the Sun. It 

is  necessary  to  note  «high  resolution»  of  our  method  –  presence  of  rather  narrow  peaks 

corresponding to these two periods.

the given shape with the one-minute resolution. Measurements on May 29 - June 1 

2004, the counter with static collimator, directed on the West. Abscissa is time interval 

in minutes. Ordinate is number of similar histogram pairs. 95% confidence intervals are marked. 

 

Results of experiments with collimators restricting a flow of the alpha particles of radioactive 

decay in different directions, serve as a confirmation of conclusion about dependence of histogram 

shapes on an exposition of laboratory to the celestial sphere and the Sun. Results of an experiment 

with collimator making 3 revolutions a day, counter-clockwise in a plane parallel Celestial Equator 

[11],  are  presented  at  Fig.3.  In  view  of  one  more  revolution  made  by  the  Earth  daily  rotation,  we 

acquire 4 revolutions in a day.

clockwise  plus  one  revolution  of  the  Earth.  Occurrence  of  6-hour  (360  minute) 

periods of realization of similar one-minute histograms. With each new revolution 

regarding  the  Celestial  sphere,  the  degree  of  distinction  of  the  "sidereal"  and 

"solar" periods grows.  Lower 95% confidence limits are marked. 

 

 

 

 

Measurements of  May 29 –September 6, 2004. 1-minute histograms (by 60 one-second measurements), 

7 times smoothed. Abscissa is time interval in minutes. Ordinate is number of similar histogram pairs. By 12600 

comparisons of similarity of histograms in each period. Total in four = 50 400 comparisons. 

Apparently on fig. 3, with each revolution of collimator, distinction of "sidereal" and "solar" 

extrema grows.  In the first 6-hour period two unshared extrema equal to 359 and 360 minutes are 

visible. At two revolutions – in the 12-hour period corresponding extrema of 718 and 720 minutes 

are quite resolved and divided by one interval. At three revolutions – in 18 hour period - extrema of 

1077 and 1080 minutes, divided by two intervals are visible, at 4 revolutions the resolution is even 

stronger – extrema of 1436 and 1440 minutes, are divided by three intervals. 

Thus,  similar  histograms  are  observed  in  process  of  collimators  rotation,  when  alpha–

particles flow in identical directions regarding Celestial Sphere or the Sun. 

Yearly periods. 

Similar  histograms  with  high  likelihood  are  repeatedly  realized  with  approximately  yearly 

periods  [1,3,4].  Detailed  research  of  this  phenomenon  has  led  to  revealing  here  again  two  precise 

periods  –  “calendar”(365  days)  and  “sidereal”(365  days  plus  6  hours).  At  higher  resolution  when 

comparing one-minute histograms, the following important details come to light: 

The “calendar” extremum of likelihood of occurrence of similar histograms is observed not 

in one year precisely, but at the period which is one minute less then number of minutes in one year 

 

4

(1440 х 365 = 525600), i.e. in 525599 minutes; for two years it is exactly two minutes earlier, i.e. in 

1 051 198 minutes, for three years it is exactly three minutes earlier, i.e. in 1 576 797 minutes. 

 The “sidereal” extremum of histogram similarity is observed in 365 days and 369 minutes (6 

hours plus 09 minutes). For two-year interval delay is equal 369 х 2 = to 738 minutes. In three years 

delay makes 369 х 3 = 1107 minutes. 

Figures 4 – 9 illustrate above-mentioned phenomena. 

 

Fig.  4.  The  yearly  period  of  occurrence  of  similar  histograms,  as  well  as  about-daily, 

consists of two extrema. Similar hourly histograms with high likelihood are realized equally in 

a  year  (365  days)  –  “the  calendar  period”;  and  in  a  year  plus  6  hours  (365,25  day)  –  the 

“sidereal” period. Distribution is obtained after comparison of the histograms constructed by 

results of measurements with one-year interval October 23 through November 10 in 2000 and 

2001.  Abscissa  is  time  interval  in  hours  minus  one  year.  Ordinate  is  number  of  similar 

histogram pairs corresponding to the given size of an interval. Lower 95% confidence limits are 

marked for peaks. 

 

It  is  visible  on  fig.  4  that  the  likelihood  of  realization  of  hourly  histograms  of  the  similar 

form sharply grows: 1) at the same dates and hours exactly in a year – “calendar” period, and 2) in 

a year and 6 hours – the “sidereal” period. 

When comparing one-minute histograms, it is evident (fig. 5), that the “calendar” period is 

shorter then one year for 1 minute: it is equal not to 525600 minutes, but 525599 minutes, and the 

“sidereal” period is equal to calculated value (525969 minutes)

Fig.  5.  When  comparing  one-minute  histograms  “calendar”  period  is  equal  to  525599 

minutes (1 minute less then number of minutes in a year), and the “sidereal” period is equal to 

525969  minutes,  i.e.  365  day  6  hours  and  09  minutes.  Measurements  with  one-year  interval: 

November, 24, 2001 and November, 24, 2002. Abscissa is time interval in minutes. Ordinate is 

number of similar histogram pairs corresponding to the given size of an interval. Lower 95% 

confidence limits are marked for peaks. 

 

One-minute  difference  of  “calendar”  period  from  exactly  one  year  has  been  confirmed  in 

large series of experiments with comparison of 80 000 pairs of histograms. 

Fig. 6 represents results of comparison of hourly histograms constructed by measurements 

with two-year interval in August – September 2000 and 2002. 

Fig. 6. Similar histograms are realized with a high likelihood exactly in two years and in 

2 years plus 12 hours (with resolution of one hour).  Measurements  in  August –  September, 2000 and

2002.  Abscissa  is  time  interval  in  hours  minus  two  years.  Ordinate  is  number  of  similar  histogram  pairs 

corresponding to the given size of an interval.  Lower 95% confidence limits are marked for peaks. 

 At more detailed analysis of two-year interval, when comparing one-minute histograms, it 

has been shown, that the first “calendar” period is in 2 minutes less then two-year interval and is 

equal to 1051198, instead of 1051200 minutes; the second “sidereal” period appeared to be in 369 х 

2 = 738 minutes longer that two-year interval. It is shown at fig. 7. This result also is reproduced 

repeatedly. 

Fig.  7.  For  measurements  with  one-minute  resolution,  in  two-year  interval  similar 

histograms  are  realized  with  two  periods:  first  is  two  minutes  less  then  exact  two  years,  and 

second is 738 minutes more then two years. Measurements at April, 20, 2001 and 2003. Abscissa is time 

interval in minutes. Ordinate is number of similar histogram pairs corresponding to the given size of an interval.  

Lower 95% confidence limits are marked for peaks. 

In  this  case  for  assurance  of  higher  statistical  reliability  of  defining  of  size  of  “calendar” 

period  for  two-year  interval,  comparison  of  more  than  80  000  pairs  histograms  has  been  made. 

(81900 comparisons were made, 3789 or 4,7 % similar pairs were found, and interval distributions of 

the same shape as at the fig.7 were obtained.)  

For  tree-year  interval  with  1-hour  histograms  there  were  received  two  periods  again: 

“calendar”, equal to number of hours in three years, and “sidereal”, bigger then the first one for 18 

hours. It is shown at fig. 8.

 Fig.  8.  Similar  histograms  are  realized  exactly  in  three  years  and  in  3  years  plus  18 

hours  (with  resolution  of  one  hour).  Measurements  in  August  –  October  of  2000  and  2003. 

Abscissa  is  time  interval  in  hours  minus  three  years.  Ordinate  is  number  of  similar  histogram  pairs 

corresponding to the given size of an interval. Lower 95% confidence limits are marked for peaks. 

 

To  statistically  significant  determine  a  value  of  “calendar”  period  in  three  years  with  the 

resolution 1 minute, there were performed about 200000 comparisons of histograms. Results of these 

comparisons are presented at fig. 9.

Fig.  9.  In  measurements  with  tree-year  interval  (in  1576800  minutes)  maximum  of 

likelihood  of  similar  histograms  is  realized  at  three  minutes  earlier  then  exact  “calendar”  3-

year period. (Measurements in 2000 and 2003: А – in October, Б – in August and November). 

Abscissa  is  time  interval  in  minutes  minus  number  of  minutes  in  three  years.  Ordinate  is  number  of  similar 

histogram pairs corresponding to the given size of an interval. Lower 95% confidence limits are marked for 

peaks. 

For  4-year  interval  the  tendency  discussed  above  was  kept.  While  not  taking  into  account 

the  leap  day  (not  adding  February  29),  the  “calendar”  extremum  is  observed  at  4  minutes  earlier 

then an estimated time. The addition of leap day changes the picture. Now the advancing in time of 

occurrence of “calendar” extremum makes 8 minutes. Besides, there is a precise “zero” extremum, 

which  is  exactly  equal  to  the  number  of  minutes  in  4  years  (3  regular  years  (365x3)  +  leap  year 

(366 days) => [365 x 3 + 366] х 1440 = 2103840 minutes). 

In 4 years the shift of “sidereal” extremum without addition of leap day would make 369 х 4 

=  1440+36  minutes.  After  addition  of  leap  day,  part  of  the  shift  equal  to  1440  minutes  is 

compensated. The rest of 36 minutes appears not compensated. 

All  this  was  shown  at  comparison  of  the  histograms  constructed  by  results  of  one-second 

measurements on August, 2-3 and on August, 29-30, in 2000 and 2004.

It is shown at fig. 10. 

 

Fig. 10. In 4 years (measurements in the same dates and time of day in 2000 and 2004, 

August,  2-3  and  29-30)  three  extrema  of  increase  in  likelihood  of  occurrence  of  similar  one-

minute  histograms  are  observed:  first  is  “calendar”  period,  8  minutes  before  an  estimated 

time,  the  second  is  equal  to  4  years  exactly  (“zero  point”),  and  the  third  “sidereal”  is  in  36 

minutes  after  “zero  point”.  Abscissa  is  time  interval  in  minutes  minus  number  of  minutes  in  three  years. 

Ordinate  is  number  of  similar  histogram  pairs  corresponding  to  the  given  size  of  an  interval.  Lower  95% 

confidence limits are marked for peaks. 

The  results  presented  at  fig.  10  can  be  explained  by  the  following  way:  *)  as  known, 

sidereal day is at 3 minutes and 55.90656 seconds (= 235.90656 seconds) shorter then solar day. In 

365 days this difference will make 235.90656 х 365 = 86105.8944 seconds. It is less than duration 

of average solar day by 58.199 seconds. It means, that for one-year interval the celestial sphere is 

reproduced  approximately  1  minute  later  then  the  solar  “New  Year”.  We  observe  annual  shift  of 

“calendar”  extremum  in  one  minute  earlier  then  solar  one.  Consequently,  the  true  annual  shift  of 

“calendar” extremum is equal to 2 minutes in a year: one minute is compensated by the specified 

difference of solar and sidereal day. For 4-years interval shift of “calendar” extremum is equal to 8 

minutes,  as  it  was  shown  after  taking  into  account  of  additional  leap  date  of  February  29, 

compensating  an  inequality  of  star  and  solar  day.  The  display  of  a  “zero  extremum”,  a  sharp 

increase  in  likelihood  of  repeated  realization  of  similar  histograms,  appeared  exactly  in  4  years, 

demands additional investigation. The extremum of “36 minutes” according to above-mentioned, is 

 

10

the  rest  of  shift  of  “sidereal”  extremum  after  compensation  of  1440  minutes  by  inclusion  of  one

Discussion 

During many years, while investigating the fine structure of statistical distributions of results 

of  measurements  of  processes  of  the  different  nature  –  shapes  of  corresponding  histograms  –  we 

discussed  the  possible  nature  of  the  found  regularities  [1-4].  Not  repeating  above-mentioned,  it  is 

necessary to emphasize major statements. 

1.  Regular  transformation  of  fine  structure  of  histograms  does  not  contradict  to  “basics  of 

science”.  

During last centuries the random variability of results of measurements was, as a rule, only 

undesirable attribute complicating certain conclusions about the investigated phenomenon. Methods 

of statistical processing allow minimizing undesirable effects of results variation. On the other hand, 

integrated  characteristics  of  this  variation  have  allowed  drawing  the  important  conclusions  on  the 

nature of investigated processes. An example to this can be an evidence of compliance of processes 

of radioactive decay with Poisson distribution, confirming independence of decay of each atom [3]. 

The  evidence  of  the  regular  nature  of  variations  of  thin  structure  of  histograms,  including 

“obviously  random”  processes  such  as  radioactive  decay,  does  not  contradict  the  available  data. 

Modern “criteria of agreement” of hypotheses are integrated and "do not detect" this fine structure 

[4]. 

 

2.  Regular  changes  of  fine  structure  of  distributions  (the  shapes  of  histograms)  are  not 

connected to changes of the measured value itself (its average) and do not depend on process nature. 

During each given moment, in the given place they with high likelihood are similar at measurements 

of any processes – from biochemical reactions through radioactive decay [1-4,9]. 

3. In this connection over 25 years ago we have chosen radioactive decay as the basic object 

of research. This choice has been proved by apparent independence of radioactive decay of changes 

of laboratory conditions of carrying out the experiment. We have chosen alpha decay from different 

kinds of radioactive decay, because of its independence of conditions of measurements and presence 

of the perfect (semi-conductor) detectors practically excluding instrumental deviations [3,4]. During 

long-term,  whenever  possible  continuous  round-the-clock  measurements,  we  accumulated  tons  of 

results of measurements in computer archive. 

11

4. The only common thing at investigation of processes of various natures was a place and 

time  of  conducting  measurements.  It  gave  us  an  assumption  that  the  possible  reason  of  the 

observable  phenomena  is  fluctuations  of  space-time  continuum.  Fluctuations  of  space-time  are 

connected with non-homogeneous mass distribution in surrounding space and moving of measured 

objects regarding these heterogeneous masses. Such movements are caused by rotation of the Earth, 

movement of the Earth along the solar orbit, nutations of terrestrial axis, movement of Solar system 

in the Galaxy, etc. These movements are revealed in changes of interposition of the Earth, the Sun, 

the Moon and, probably, other space objects. 

5. Abovementioned corresponds to results of measurements in different geographical points 

from Arctic through Antarctic Region, at ground laboratories in the different countries and on board 

of the ships at Pacific, Indian, Atlantic and Arctic oceans [5,10]. 

The major result of these measurements is detection of synchronism of changes of the shape 

of histograms in different geographical points at the same local time. 

6.  The  establishment  of  equality  of  the  daily  period  of  change  of  likelihood  of  repeated 

occurrence  of  histograms  of  the  given  shape,  to  1440  minutes  (“solar  day”),  as  well  as  to  1436 

minutes (“sidereal day”) [4] was essentially important. 

7.  Presence  of  the  daily  period  in  changes  of  the  shape  of  histograms,  means,  that  “the 

affecting cause” is shielded by the Earth and appears above the horizon in the process of the Earth 

rotation.  The  narrowness  of  corresponding  extrema,  their  one-minute  resolution,  confirms  sharp 

anisotropy  of  this  "cause".  In  direct  experiments  with  collimators,  restricting  the  flow  of  alpha 

particles  in  certain  directions,  this  sharp  anisotropy  has  received  accurate  confirmation  [6,7.] 

Particularly convincing picture has been obtained in experiments with rotated collimators: the shape 

of histograms depends on a direction of alpha particle flow [11]. 

8.  The  data  presented  in  this  paper  on  the  nature  of  the  yearly  periods  in  variations  of  the 

histogram shapes, open new features of the investigated phenomenon. It confirms the dependence of 

the histogram shape on exposition relative to the celestial sphere and to the Sun. 

As appeared, in a year, histograms of the given shape show again in 2 minutes ahead of time 

of  corresponding  orientation  of  the  Earth  and  the  Sun.  Such  shift  of  “calendar”  extremum  can  be 

explained  either  by  nutation  of  the  Earth  axis,  or  by  movement  of  Solar  system,  as  the  whole, 

regarding other objects in the Galaxy. 

The  “sidereal”  extremum  corresponds  to  the  position  of  the  Earth  in  a  circumsolar  orbit, 

when the Sun appears (is projected on) against the same star, as one year ago. It remains not clear 

why this extremum is not shifted year after year as well as “calendar” extremum.  

 

12

9.  The  fine  structure  of  analyzed  histograms,  presence  of  the  "permitted"  and  "forbidden" 

values  of  measurements,  narrowness  of  corresponding  "peaks"  and  "hollows",  rather  reminds  the 

phenomena of an interference. This structure cannot be explained by presence of several likelihood 

constants (“constants of disintegration”) [4]. Interference is property of wave processes. Therefore it 

suggests  a  possible  wave  nature  of  the  investigated  phenomenon.  The  similar  explanation  of  the 

nature  of  the  paradox  of  experiments  with  collimators  suggested  by  D.P.Harakoz  seems  plausible. 

Collimators  that  we  use,  “cut  out”  sites  about  5  angular  degrees  on  celestial  sphere,  which 

correspond to 20 minutes of time at rotation of the Earth about the axis. We see (at figures presented 

in  this  paper)  extrema  with  the  resolution  of  one  minute.  Such  sharp  peaks  are  most  naturally 

explained by interference – summation of wave streams coming in different angles, or distinguished 

by phase. The nature of these wave streams is a subject for discussion. 

In  conclusion  it  is  necessary  to  note,  that discussed  phenomena  are  rather  complex  and  are 

defined, apparently, by set of factors. In this connection various hypotheses were stated by authors of

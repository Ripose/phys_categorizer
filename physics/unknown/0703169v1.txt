Abstract: A femtosecond mode-locked laser is used for the first time as a broadband infrared 
source for high resolution Fourier transform absorption spectroscopy. Demontration is made 
with a Cr4+:YAG laser. The entire ν1+ν3 vibration-rotation band region of acetylene, observed 
after passing through a single pass 80-cm long cell, is simultaneously recorded between 1480 
and 1600 nm, in 7.9 s with a signal to noise ratio equal to 1000. Two hot bands of the most 
abundant  acetylene  isotopologue  and  the  ν1+ν3  band  of  the  13C12CH2  are  also  present.  The 
noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second averaging is equal to 7 10-7 cm-1.Hz-1/2 
per spectral element.

Over  the  past  few  years,  high  sensitivity  spectroscopic  techniques  have  gained  in 
efficiency and several experimental schemes now enable to reach ppb detection levels. One of 
the  prevailing  quests  presently  aims  at  combining  these  sensitivities  with  rapid  diagnostic 
and/or  multi-species  gas  analysis.  This  induces  new  approaches  able  to  couple  broadband 
coherent  sources  to  multiplex  or  multichannel  spectrometers.  Nowadays  at  high  spectral 
resolution,  simultaneous  spectral  coverage  is  still often restricted [1-3] to a few  nanometers 
due  to  multichannel  grating  spectrometer  limitation  and/or  to  narrow  spectral  range  optical 
source  capabilities.  With  the  breakthrough  of  mode-locked  femtosecond  (fs)  lasers  and 
frequency  combs  [4],  extremely  broad  “steady  state”  high  quality  coherent  sources  have 
become  available.  This  prompted  the  need  for  related  spectral  approaches  able  to  deliver  at 
once high resolution, high accuracy, broad spectral coverage and rapid acquisition. Purposely, 
a broadband frequency comb was coherently coupled [5] to a high finesse cavity across 100 
nm,  with  an  equivalent  absorption  path  equal  to  1.13  km.  Nevertheless,  due  to  lack  of 
appropriate  spectroscopic  method,  this  recent  impressive  experiment  provided  simultaneous 
spectral results limited to 15 nm, 25 GHz resolution with signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the 
order  of  15.  Finally  with  the  same  purpose,  a  broadband  cw  Cr2+:ZnSe  laser  used  for 
intracavity  absorption  spectroscopy  was  coupled  [6]  to  a  high  resolution  time-resolved 
Fourier transform interferometer. A simultaneous coverage of 125 nm was obtained with 330 
MHz resolution, 2.5 km equivalent absorption path length and SNR equal to 100. 

With the above motivations in mind, a mode-locked femtosecond laser source has been 
efficiently  analyzed  by  a  high  resolution  commercial  Fourier  transform  spectrometer.  This 
paper reports this first-step experiment with the illustrating C2H2 spectra covering 118 nm  in 
the 1540 nm region. The perspectives in terms of high sensitivity spectroscopy, especially in 
the infrared region, are then examined. 

The  present  experiment  is  based  on  the  coupling  of  a  Cr4+:YAG  mode-locked  laser 
source emitting in the 1.45 µm region to a Fourier transform spectrometer. Cr4+:YAG lasers 
have the ability to produce pulses as short as 20 fs [7] in the wavelength range from 1250 to 
1600  nm.  These  femtosecond  lasers  operate  at  room temperature, may be diode-pumped [8] 
and  have  larger  gain  bandwidths  than  Er-doped  fiber  lasers.  The  experimental  set-up  is 
schematized  on  Fig.  1.  A  1064  nm  commercial  Nd:YVO4  laser  pumps  a  20-mm-long 
Cr4+:YAG  Brewster-cut  crystal.  Its  beam  is  focused  onto  the  crystal  through  the  dichroic 
mirror M1 by a 75-mm-focal-length lens. The crystal is temperature-stabilized with a thermo-
electric  cooler  to  about  286  K.  The  astigmatically-compensated X-shaped cavity consists of 
two spherical mirrors M1 and M2 with 100 mm radius of curvature (ROC), four plane chirped 
mirrors  (CM)  from  Layertec  M3,  M4,  M6,  M7,  a  0.8  %-transmission  plane  output  coupler 
(OC),  a  concave  focusing  mirror  M5  with  ROC  100  mm  and  a  semiconductor  saturable 
absorber mirror (SESAM) from Batop on a heat sink. The CM have second-order dispersion 
of approximately -100 fs2 and third-order dispersion of -800 fs3 per bounce at 1500 nm. They 
provide  high  reflectivity  (>  99.9%)  in  the  range  1300-1730  nm.  The  two  collimated  arms 
respectively are 45 and 41 cm long.  The cavity is in the open air. Laser threshold occurs at 
about  2.0  W  of  pumping  power  and  5.5  W  (about  60  %  absorbed)  are  enough  to  get  stable 
mode-locked operation with pulse repetition rate of about 150 MHz and an average power of 
150 mW typically measured at the output of the oscillator.  

The laser beam passes through a 80-cm cell filled with acetylene in natural abundance 
(pressure  equal  to  128  hPa).  It  is  analyzed  by  a  commercial  rapid-scan  Fourier  transform 
spectrometer (Bruker IFS66) as if it was a steady-state source. The spectrometer is equipped 
with a fluorine beam-splitter and an InGaAs detector. High resolution may be reached using a 
femtosecond  laser  source  since  the  narrow  molecular  absorbing  lines  enhance  the  light 
coherence length up to a resolution limited by their linewidth. Figure 2 gives an illustration of 
the resulting spectra. The whole spectral domain of laser emission extends over 118 nm (500 
cm-1) with a full width at half maximum of 46 nm (197 cm-1). Since the pulse duration is not 
crucial in our experiment, no autocorrelation measurement of the pulse width was performed.

Nevertheless,  assuming  the  classical  Fourier  transform-limited  sech  shape,  we  estimate  a 
pulse duration of 54 fs for a spectral bandwidth of 46 nm at 1530 nm. The spectral bandwidth 
restriction  on  the  lower  wavelength  side  comes  from  the  SESAM  reflectivity.  Resolution  is 
limited  by  the  spectrometer  to  6  GHz  (0.2  cm-1).  The  number  of  spectral  elements  is 
consequently  equal  to  2500.    Total  recording  time  is  7.9  s:  ten  scans  are  co-added  and  the 
fringes are scanned at a 10 kHz rate. SNR, estimated from the rms noise, is of the order of 
1000. Noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second averaging is 7 10-7 cm-1.Hz-1/2 per 
spectral element.  

All absorption lines shown on Fig.2 are due to acetylene. The most intense band is the 
ν1+ν3 band of 12C2H2. This acetylene isotopologue belongs to the point group D h. Since its 
pair of identical nuclei with a nuclear spin different from zero ( I(H) = ½ ), follows the Fermi 
statistics, even and odd rotational levels have statistical weights in the ratio of 1/3. Thanks to 
the  high  resolution  revealing  the  rotational  structure,  the  intensity  alternation  for  the  main 
band is obvious. A small part of the spectrum with an extended frequency scale is given on 
Fig.  3.  with  spectral  assignments.  Due  to  the  good  SNR,  the  ν1+ν3  band  of  H12C13CH  is 
clearly  seen  even  with  a  relative  concentration  decreased  by  about  100.  The  absence  of 
intensity alternation due to the break of the molecular symmetry of this isotopologue is also 
revealed on the figure.

The  coupling  of  Fourier  transform  spectrometers  to  mode-locked  sources  offers  new 
perspectives for high resolution and high sensitivity broadband absorption spectroscopy. This 
experiment may indeed be improved in terms of sensitivity, spectral domain, resolution and 
acquisition time, as discussed below.  

Sensitivity  may  be  enhanced  by  increasing  the  interaction  path  between  light  and 
sample. The most promising spectra should result from the coupling demonstrated in [5] of a 
femtosecond frequency comb to a high finesse cavity. More precisely using a 39.4 cm long 
cell, corresponding to 380 MHz free spectral range, [5] reports an integrated absorption equal 
to  2.5  10-5  with  1.4  ms  acquisition  time.  Their  grating  spectrometer  has  15  nm  bandwidth 
(from 809 to 824 nm) at 25GHz resolution, corresponding to 270 spectral elements. Therefore 
their noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second averaging is 1.4 10-9 cm-1.Hz-1/2 per 
spectral  element.  Their  set-up  involves  a  cavity  with  a  finesse  equal  to  4500,  which 
corresponds  to  about  1.13  km  equivalent  path  length.  Absorption  path  of  80  m  is  rather 
common in the laboratory with a classical multipass cell. It is therefore worth noticing that a 
100-time  increase  of  the  present  absorption  path  length  (80  cm)  would  already  provide  an 
integrated absorption equal to 10-5 and a noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second 
averaging of 7 10-9 cm-1.Hz-1/2 per spectral element. With a much simpler experimental set-up, 
this integrated absorption would be 2.5 times better than the one reported in [5] with only 5 
times worse noise equivalent absorption at one second averaging per spectral element.  

Any  spectral  domain,  from  the  UV  to  the  far-infrared,  may  be  probed  with  Fourier 
transform  spectroscopy,  most  often  with  Doppler-limited  resolution  and  with  no  other 
restriction on the spectral simultaneous coverage than the detector responsivity. Typically, up 
to  several  106  independent  spectral  elements  are  sampled  within  one  experiment.  The 
technique is therefore appropriate even for supercontinua laser sources [9]. 

Resolving  ability  of  the  grating  instruments  suffer  from  drastic  limitations  when 
compared to Fourier interferometers. This is due to the restricted size of the available gratings 
and  the  inability  of  a  laser  beam  to  cover  the  entire  grating  so  to  benefit  from  its  full 
resolution. Commercially available Fourier spectrometers based on Michelson interferometers 
exhibit  up  to  30  MHz  resolution.  When  using  a  frequency  comb  [10]  as  a  Fourier 
spectrometer,  this  resolution  has  virtually  no  practical  limitation.  For  instance,  1  MHz-
repetition  rate  mode-locked  oscillators  have  been  demonstrated  [11]  or  stroboscopic 
approaches may be implemented.  

Very  short  acquisition  times  are  reachable  with  spectrometers  presenting  no  moving 
parts  like  for  instance  grating,  virtually  imaged  phased  array  [12],  stationary  Fourier

interferometers  [13]  all  equipped  with  CCD  array  detector,  and  frequency  comb  Fourier 
spectrometer.  The  frequency  comb  approach  has  the  advantage  of  needing  a  single  detector 
and therefore, in principle, does not suffer as the other techniques from a severe restriction on 
the number of spectral elements. This limitation may be overcome at the reasonable expenses 
of  acquisition  time.  In  the  ms  acquisition  time  range,  ultrafast  scanning  Fourier  Michelson 
interferometers are available [14]. If high resolution combined with high spectral bandwidth is 
needed,  conventional  fast-scanning  Michelson  interferometers  appear  as  being  the  best 
solution: optical velocities in path difference are generally between 0.1 and 10 cm.s−1, so that 
75 MHz resolution may be reached with 106 spectral elements within only 20 seconds. Time 
resolution ability with high spectral resolution is also at work [15]. 

In conclusion, we report the coupling for the first time of a femtosecond mode-locked 
laser used as a broadband infrared source to a high resolution Fourier transform spectrometer. 
Acetylene absorption spectra, recorded using a Cr4+:YAG laser, clearly show the efficiency of 
this  approach.  Comparisons  to  recent  experiments  motivated  by  similar  objectives  are 
satisfactory.  Improvements  in  sensitivity,  spectral  extension,  resolution  and  acquisition  time 
by combining femtosecond broadband laser sources to Fourier spectrometers are in progress.
